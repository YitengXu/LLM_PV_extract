    , Accepted 19th April 2017First published on 19th April 2017AbstractLight wave manipulation by using nanostructures is a promising strategy for enhancing the light absorption of thin photoactive layers in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Here, we propose a method for nanopatterning the multiple interfaces in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs by using soft imprint lithography at room temperature. The interfaces in the OPVs were separately modified in the front ZnO layers and the back metal electrodes with a grating pattern. Each nanopattern increased the light absorption and the power conversion efficiency of the OPVs by up to 32.5% depending on the materials. Moreover, the nanopatterning at both the front and the back cumulatively increased the light absorption, resulting in the highest efficiency increase of 38.5%. The increases were observed in various BHJ systems with different properties containing the polymers PTB7, PCE10, P3HT, or PNTz4T. A certified performance of 10.31% was achieved for the PNTz4T:PC71BM system in the presence of the nanopatterns. Detailed analysis by using the absorption spectra and optical simulations indicated that the origins of the optical gains from the nanopatterns on the front and the back are different. The front pattern increases the transmittance and the back pattern increases the scattering and excites the surface plasmon polaritons.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have many advantages such as cost- and energy-effective fabrication, semi-transparency, and mechanical flexibility.1–3 There have been many studies on the synthesis of new narrow-bandgap materials for improving photon harvesting properties,4–6 optimization of the morphology in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) films,7 interfacial modification for better charge carrier collection,8–10 and design of novel device structures11 to increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPVs. Generally, the PCE of OPVs is still limited by the weak absorbance of the thin photoactive layers in the solar spectrum range. To solve this problem, the thickness of the photoactive layer must be increased to absorb more incident photons. However, loss from charge recombination is high in thick films because of the low mobility of the charges in BHJ structures, resulting in a lower fill factor (FF).12,13 This trade-off between the absorption and the charge recombination leads to an optimum active layer thickness of 80–100 nm, which is generally not thick enough to harness all incident light.
Light wave manipulation is required to maximize the use of the incident light energy within the limited thickness of the photoactive layer. Many studies have increased the photon absorption in the photoactive layer through various manipulation methods, such as ternary system,14–16 tandem or triple-junction solar cells,17,18 textured surface structures for antireflection coatings,19,20 plasmonic nanostructures with periodic gratings,21 and metal nanoparticles (NPs),22 and combinations of these methods.23,24 Although some approaches have improved the OPV performance, there are still several problems with light wave manipulation. First, OPVs with optical nanostructures incorporated into or close to the organic active layers often suffer from a reduction in FF.25,26 There have been no reports where the FF of OPVs with optical nanostructures is higher than 0.7, whereas well-optimized OPVs without nanostructures often have FFs higher than 0.7. This could be due to undesirable coupling between the optical and electronic properties of the organic films; introducing nanostructures with sizes comparable to the organic film thickness may increase the absorption but also detrimentally affect the electrical properties, such as increasing contact resistance at the electrode interface and decreasing shunt resistance owing to the non-uniformity of the organic films. Therefore, for the optical manipulations alone to improve the OPV performance, decoupling the optical enhancement and the electronic properties of the active layers is an important challenge.
Second, the origin of the improvements in the OPV performance arising from the nanostructures is still unclear. This is partly because there are many mechanisms that can affect the absorption of the films such as reflection, scattering, diffraction, and plasmonic effects, including local surface plasmon resonance and surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs).27,28 In addition, there are several interfaces or components in OPVs that can be modified, but they are often difficult to control separately, except the antireflection coating at the substrate surface. For example, introducing a nanostructure at the front electrode interface often changes the texture of the back interface, which complicates clarification of the contributions from each interface. Combining multiple nanostructures is important to maximize the optical gain if they can be modified and tuned separately.
In this study, we have developed patterning methods for front ZnO layers and back organic/metal electrode interfaces in OPVs by using soft imprint lithography with a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold. The one-dimensional (1D) grating structure of a blank DVD-R was used to generate the Bloch surface waves at the interfaces of the different materials and to manipulate the scattering characteristics of light. Our methods have several advantages over previous reports on the nanopatterning of OPVs. The nanopatterning of the ZnO layer in previous reports generally relies on the hydrolysis of a sol–gel ZnO precursor, which requires a relatively high temperature (∼150°C). The shrinkage of the material during hydrolysis makes it difficult to control the size and shape of the nanopatterns. The surface may also be contaminated by the mold materials at the high temperature, which could deteriorate the interfacial contact. We used ZnO NPs to pattern the ZnO layer at room temperature, which allowed us to prepare a well-defined nanopattern with a clean surface. The back interface was patterned by directly patterning the organic layer with the same mold.29 Because the height of the nanostructures was much smaller than the active layer thickness, the nanopatterning at both the interfaces could be performed separately. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to pattern the front and the back of the active layer separately, which allows us to see the optical effects of the treatment at each side. We also expected the optical and the electrical properties to be decoupled because the height of the nanopatterns was lower than in previous reports. The origin of the increase in OPV performance was discussed based on electrical and optical measurements and an electromagnetic simulation based on the finite element method (FEM).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows a schematic illustration of the procedure to introduce the nanopatterns to the surface ZnO layer and the BHJ layer in OPVs by soft imprint lithography using a PDMS mold. The complete device structure was ITO glass/ZnO NPs (with or without the pattern, 40 nm)/donor polymer:acceptor (with or without the pattern, 110–280 nm)/MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag electrode (80 nm). The surface morphology of the PDMS mold observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed a nanoscale grating pattern with a grating depth of 75 nm and a period of 760 nm (Fig. 1a). This is a replica of the grating pattern in the master template of a blank DVD-R disc with a depth and period of 120 and 760 nm, respectively (Fig. S2†). ZnO NPs with an average diameter of 3.7 nm were synthesized according to the synthetic procedure in the Experimental section (the full characterization of ZnO NPs is shown in the ESI†). After the ZnO NP solution was spin-coated on the ITO glass substrate, the PDMS mold was immediately placed on the surface to form the nanopattern. The patterned ZnO layer showed a grating structure with a period of 760 nm, equal to that of the patterned PDMS, and a grating depth of 35 nm (Fig. 1b). This film was processed at room temperature and no thermal annealing was required for hydrolysis, unlike sol–gel synthesized ZnO layers.25,26,30,31 This low temperature suppresses the shrinkage of the material volume after drying, forming high-quality, high-density ZnO layers compared to the sol–gel synthesized ZnO layers. A BHJ layer based on PTB7:PC71BM was spin-coated on the ZnO layer. Before the surface was patterned with the PDMS mold, the surface of the as-cast BHJ film on the ZnO nanopattern did not show a grating pattern (Fig. S2d†) because the height of the ZnO nanopattern underneath (35 nm) was much smaller than the thickness of the BHJ layers (110–280 nm). After the second patterning on the surface of the BHJ layer (the grating direction was perpendicular to that of the ZnO layer), the surface showed a grating structure with a period of 760 nm, which was identical to that of the PDMS mold, and a depth of 55 nm (Fig. 1c). After the vacuum depositions of MoO3 and Ag, the grating pattern was still visible on the surface of the Ag electrode because the MoO3/Ag layer was thin enough to replicate the surface morphology (Fig. S2†).

Photographs (left) and AFM images (right) of (a) the PDMS mold, (b) the patterned ZnO layer, and (c) the patterned photoactive layer are shown in the insets. 
Similar patterning procedures were used for other donor polymer systems (i.e., PCE10, P3HT, and PNTz4T). Four types of devices with or without patterning at each interface were fabricated by changing the patterning steps: devices with flat ZnO(f-ZnO)/flat Ag (f-Ag) interfaces (reference); patterned ZnO (p-ZnO)/f-Ag; f-ZnO/patterned Ag (p-Ag, single-side patterned); and p-ZnO/p-Ag (both-side patterned). To minimize batch-to-batch variations, each series of four devices were fabricated in the same round of polymer blend spin-coating and MoO3/Ag electrode deposition.

Fig. 2a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PTB7:PC71BM-based OPVs fabricated with the four different structures under 100 mW cm−2 air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) illumination. The short circuit current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), FF, and PCE of the devices are summarized in Table 1. Introducing the nanopattern either in the ZnO layer or the Ag interface increased JSC from 15.42 mA cm−2 in the reference device (f-ZnO/f-Ag) to 15.96 mA cm−2 (p-ZnO/f-Ag) and 16.67 mA cm−2 (f-ZnO/p-Ag). VOC remained the same at 0.72 V as the reference device for the patterned devices. Interestingly, introducing the nanopattern slightly increased the FF; p-ZnO/f-Ag devices had a higher FF of 70.2% than the reference device (67.7%). Consequently, PCE increased from 7.50% (f-ZnO/f-Ag) to 8.16% (p-ZnO/f-Ag) and 8.25% (f-ZnO/p-Ag). Moreover, introducing the nanopatterns into both the ZnO and Ag sides increased JSC further to 17.23 mA cm−2 (p-ZnO/p-Ag), while maintaining a similar VOC and a slightly better FF compared with the reference device. This cumulative enhancement in JSC by the nanopatterns resulted in a PCE of 8.72% for p-ZnO/p-Ag, which was the highest among the four devices with the same active layer.

Importantly, introducing the nanopatterns did not have detrimental effects on the VOC or FF. The FF increased substantially in p-ZnO/f-Ag devices. In previous research on the nanostructure in the front electrode,25,26 introducing the nanostructure usually decreased FF to less than 70%. This was probably because of the large height of the nanopattern (∼80 nm) at the front side, which reduced the uniformity of the organic layer, decreasing the shunt resistance. In contrast, the height of the nanopattern in the p-ZnO layer in this study was only 35 nm, which is small enough not to change the structure of the spin-coated film on top (Fig. S2d and S3†). To clarify this, J–V curves measured with a logarithmic scale in the dark were compared for the devices (Fig. 2b). Introducing the nanopatterns actually decreased the current in the reversed bias region compared with the reference device. Series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSh) were calculated from the curves (Table 1). Introducing the nanopatterns decreased the RS values slightly compared with the reference device, whereas it decreased the RSh values.32 Although the reason for this improvement is not clear, these results at least show that the nanostructures did not degrade the electrical properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to show a high FF of larger than 70% in OPVs with a nanopattern on the front electrode comparable to those of the well-optimized BHJ OPVs with flat structures.
To show the generality of the enhancements in the performance, we applied the nanopatterns to BHJ OPVs based on the other semiconducting polymers with thin films with different structures and properties, namely PCE10 (low crystallinity) and P3HT and PNTz4T (high crystallinity). The results are summarized in Table 1 and the J–V curves are presented in Fig. S6–14.† The nanopatterns functioned in a similar way for all the BHJ systems that we tried. Introducing the nanopattern to a single side (either p-ZnO or p-Ag) increased JSC by 3.5–8.1% and introducing the patterning to both sides increased JSC further in all the devices, resulting in the best performance among the devices with the same active layer. In particular, the PNTz4T:PC71BM device with p-ZnO and p-Ag showed the maximum PCE of 10.6% (10.41% on average). This slightly outperforms the highest PCE previously reported for PNTz4T:PC71BM (10.1%).33 The PCE of 10.31% was certified for the PNTz4T:PC71BM device at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (Fig. S15†). In addition, we also demonstrated that p-ZnO and p-Ag can be introduced into the OPV devices on flexible ITO/PET substrates owing to the room temperature process for fabricating the ZnO NPlayer. The JSC of the flexible OPVs based on PCE10:PC71BM was increased from 15.66 (f-ZnO/f-Ag) to 17.41 mA cm−2 (f-ZnO/f-Ag), resulting in the increase of the PCE from 4.45% to 6.58% (Fig. S16†). These results showed that the cumulative gain from the nanopatterns is widely applicable to various materials and substrates to improve the performance of OPVs in the high-efficiency region.
To understand the origin of the increase in JSC, we measured the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of OPVs based on PTB7:PC71BM (Fig. 2c). The enhancement ratios of EQE relative to the f-ZnO/f-Ag reference device are shown in Fig. 2d. The p-ZnO/f-Ag device showed a large increase in the photocurrent generation in the wavelength region around 400 nm. In contrast, the f-ZnO/p-Ag device showed an increase in the wavelength ranges of 350–500 nm and >700 nm. In particular, the EQE around 850 nm was substantially increased. This was also seen in the slight red shift of the onsets of the EQE spectra in Fig. 2c owing to the introduction of p-Ag. This result suggests that p-ZnO and p-Ag increased the photocurrent by different mechanisms in different wavelength regions.
The device patterned on both sides showed the combination of the effects of p-ZnO and p-Ag and a higher EQE spectrum compared with the other OPV devices in the wavelength range of 300–900 nm in addition to the valley around 680 nm. These changes in EQE spectra matched the observed increase in JSC under simulated solar light (see Table S1† for the comparison). The effects of the p-ZnO layer can be observed in the transmission spectra of the substrates in Fig. 3a. The transmittance in the region from 350 to 450 nm was greatly increased in p-ZnO/ITO compared with f-ZnO/ITO. There was also a baseline increase in the transmittance in the longer wavelength range extended to 900 nm. The average transmittances in the wavelength range of 300–900 nm for f-ZnO/ITO and p-ZnO/ITO are 79.7% and 83.5%, respectively. This change in the transmittance could be the combination of the several factors. First, the p-ZnO layer may reduce the reflection from the back of the substrate by reducing the refractive index mismatch.34,35 The interference effect in glass/ITO/ZnO layers may have been reduced because the reflected light at the interfaces was less coherent. The average haze ratios measured for p-ZnO/ITO/glass in this wavelength region was 0.91% similar to that for f-ZnO/ITO/glass (0.43%), indicating that the effect of the light diffusion from the aggregation of ZnO NPs was negligible. Based on the transmittance spectra, we calculated the solar weighted transmittance and photonic flux density to investigate the influence of the transmittance properties of p-ZnO layers on the performance of OPVs (Fig. S4†). The solar weighted transmittance of the p-ZnO/ITO (87.7%) structure was increased by 3.5% compared with the f-ZnO/ITO (84.7%) structure. This value matched the increase in JSC well. Therefore, the increase in JSC of the p-ZnO/f-Ag device was mainly due to the higher transmittance of p-ZnO compared with f-ZnO.

To elucidate the effect of the p-Ag layer, absorption of the devices was determined by measuring the reflectance (R) and transmittance (T) of the devices (Fig. 3b). The absorption enhancement ratio relative to the f-ZnO/f-Ag reference device is shown in Fig. 3c. The p-ZnO/f-Ag device showed a slight increase in the absorption in the wavelength range of 420–500 nm and a slight decrease in 500–600 nm (see inset in Fig. 3c). The f-ZnO/p-Ag device showed increased absorption in all regions compared with the control structure, except for a small region at around 390 nm. A very strong increase in the absorption was observed at ∼850 nm and the absorption edge of PTB7 was extended up to ∼800 nm. This was attributed to the excitation of propagating the SPP of p-Ag, as discussed later. This increase in the absorption was consistent with the EQE increase in OPVs. To investigate the improvement in performance quantitatively, we calculated the solar weighted absorption (SWA) based on the absorption spectra (Fig. S5†). The SWA values of the f-ZnO/f-Ag and f-ZnO/p-Ag devices were 64.4% and 74.6%, respectively, which was an increase of 16%. This increase in absorption was larger than that of JSC (8.1%), suggesting that part of the increase in absorption arising from the introduction of p-Ag does not contribute to photocurrent generation. There may be large energy dissipation unrelated to the light absorption in BHJ, or the absorbed photons in the BHJ have a lower quantum efficiency for charge generation, possibly due to the excitation of the sub-band gap absorption of the polymers. In contrast, the increase in SWA in p-ZnO/p-Ag (78.1%) from f-ZnO/p-Ag (74.6%) was 4.7%, which was roughly accounted for by the increase in transmittance from the introduction of p-ZnO (3.5%).
To analyze the increase in absorption of the nanopatterned devices further, the optical properties of the multilayered structures were calculated by FEM with the COMSOL Multiphysics software package. The detailed calculation setups are shown in the Experimental section. Fig. 3d shows the calculated absorption (A = 1 −R−T) spectra for PTB7:PC71BM devices with the four configurations. Transverse-magnetic (TM) polarized light, the electric field of which oscillates perpendicular to the grooves of the grating structure at the Ag interface, was introduced to the devices. The change in the calculated absorption spectra upon the introduction of each nanopattern agreed well with the experimentally measured absorption spectra. The introduction of p-ZnO blue shifted the absorption peak at 470 nm to 440 nm, which corresponded to the peak shift in the measured spectra (from 500 to 480 nm in Fig. 3b), and also slightly increased the absorption from 400 to 500 nm. This increase in absorption was attributed to the anti-reflection effect of the 1D gratings on the ZnO layer. However, the introduction of p-Ag increased the absorption from 400 to 700 nm without shifting the peak, which was attributed to the increase in light scattering resulting in the enhancement of optical path length in the active layers. Consequently, the maximum absorption increase of 19.3% was observed at around 550 nm. A strong absorption peak at 800 nm was also observed, which contributed to the increase in the photocurrent response at >700 nm. Because the peak was observed only with TM polarized illumination both in the experimental and the simulated spectra (Fig. 4), the peak was attributed to the propagating surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at the Ag interface. The introduction of both p-ZnO and p-Ag resulted in an additive effect, and showed the largest increase in the absorption. Although the SPR peak at 830 nm in the experimental spectrum increased the absorption at the band edge of the polymer and increased the EQE ratio, the contribution of the peak to the photocurrent was small. To harness the increase in absorption caused by the SPR more effectively, the SPR peaks must be shifted to a shorter wavelength range by optimizing the size of the grating structures.

Conclusions
In summary, we introduced multiple nanopatterns to different interfaces in BHJ OPVs by using soft imprint lithography. The optical enhancements from each interface cumulatively increased the photocurrent, resulting in the increase of the PCE by up to 38.5%. Because the optical gains were decoupled from the electronic properties in the active layers and the mechanism of the enhancement was clarified, it would be possible to optimize the nanostructures further to increase the absorption and the performance by using suitable nanopatterns for each interface. The increase from the excitation of the SPR in p-Ag in this study is only at the edge of the polymer absorption and it contributed inefficiently to the photocurrent generation. Therefore, the positioning of this peak in the light absorption region of the active layers should increase the absorption further. This optimization using a nanopattern with different pitches is now under investigation.

Zinc acetate dihydrate (Wako, 99.9%, 1.48 g, 6.7 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (Junsei, >99.6%, 62 mL) at 65°C, and KOH solution (Wako, 99.5%, 0.75 g, 12 mmol) in methanol (30 mL) was added dropwise over 10 min to the zinc acetate dihydrate solution under vigorous stirring. During the KOH solution addition, zinc hydroxides precipitated, and after 10 min, the solution became translucent. After 80 min, ZnO NPs started to precipitate and the solution became milky white, and the reaction was terminated and the ZnO NPs were precipitated for 2 h. The supernatant was removed and the ZnO NPs were washed three times with methanol (30 mL) by using a magnetic stirrer for 10 min. To decrease the amount of methanol in the last washing procedure, the solution was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was removed and residual ZnO NPs were dissolved in chloroform (4 mL). This mother solution was slightly translucent and was stable for more than 2 months. The mother solution was diluted with methanol (1:7) prior to use. To prevent the ZnO solution from drying during spin coating, 3 v/v% of chlorobenzene (CB) was added to the solution. The characteristics of the ZnO NPs obtained by UV-vis spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray diffraction are shown in Fig. S1.†
Nanopatterned PDMS mold fabrication
To prepare a nanopatterned PDMS mold, we manually peeled off the cover layer of a blank DVD-R (TDK) with a stationery knife to reveal the grating pattern. We then washed a DVD-R mold with methanol to remove the dye layer on the grating pattern and baked it on a hot plate for 10 min at 70°C. The UV-curable PDMS mixture (X-34-4184-A/B, mixing ratio 1:1, Shin-Etsu) was degassed in a vacuum chamber for 10 min. The degassed PDMS mixture was poured onto the mold and the sample was degassed again for 10 min. The sample was irradiated with UV light (365 nm) for 3 h, and then the nanopatterned PDMS mold was peeled off the surface of the mold.
Device fabrication
Polymer solar cells with patterned structures on both sides were fabricated as shown in Fig. 1. ITO glass(15 Ω sq−1, Geomatec) was cleaned by sequential sonication in detergent, deionized (DI) water, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and DI water for 20 min each, and was baked on a hot plate for 10 min at 110°C. The ITO glass was subjected to UVO treatment for 10 min before use. The flat ZnO layer was fabricated by spin-coating ZnO NPs solution on the ITO glass at 1500 rpm in air and a 40nm-thick layer was formed without thermal treatment. The p-ZnO layer was fabricated by spin-coating the ZnO NPs solution at 4000 rpm on ITO glass to form a base ZnO layer as a waveguide layer. Next, the ZnO NP solution was spin-coated once more at 3000 rpm for 7 s on the flat ZnO layer. After spin coating, the patterned PDMS mold was gently and immediately (within 5 s) placed on top of the ZnO layer and delaminated the PDMS mold after 60 s. The thickness of p-ZnO was about 40 nm. To improve the surface morphology of the p-ZnO layer, chloroform was spin-coated onto the p-ZnO layer at 3000 rpm for 15 s. We confirmed through the separated experiments that the effect of the washing process with CHCl3 for the f-ZnO substrate was negligible on the device performance. This procedure was optimized by a systematic study of the stamping timing and thickness of the ZnO layer. The average groove depth and the average period of the patterned ZnO layer were 35 and 760 nm, respectively (Fig. 1 and S2†).
To prepare the photoactive layer of PTB7 or PCE10, a polymer/PC71BM mixture (1:1.5, 10 mg:15 mg) was dissolved in CB (1 mL) with 3 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (Sigma-Aldrich). The solutions were spin-coated on the samples with or without a p-ZnO layer at 800 rpm for 7 s in a dry, N2-filled glove box to form a 110nm-thick layer.
For P3HT, a polymer/PC61BM mixture (1:0.6, 15 mg:9 mg) was dissolved in CB (1 mL) and spin-coated on the samples with or without the p-ZnO layer to form a 120nm-thick layer, and then annealed at 150°C for 10 min.
To form a nanopattern on the photoactive layer, the patterned PDMS mold was placed on top of the photoactive layer without additional pressure. There were no visible remaining BHJ layers on the surface of the PDMS mold after peeling off, suggesting that the amount of materials would be similar in the photoactive layers with or without the patterning.
For PNTz4T, a polymer/PC71BM mixture (1:2, 4.4 mg:8.8 mg) was dissolved ino-dichlorobenzene (DCB; 1 mL). Owing to the high crystallinity of PNTz4T, it is difficult to be dissolved in DCB at room temperature. The solution was heated at 140°C for 30 min, and the hot solution was directly spin-coated on the substrate with or without the p-ZnO layer at 580 rpm for 15 s. To introduce a nanopattern on the PNTz4T layer, the patterned PDMS mold was placed on the top of the photoactive layer 2 min after finishing spin-coating without additional pressure. The thickness of the PNTz4T layer was 280 nm. To form the metal electrode, the thin films were transferred into a thermal evaporator. A MoO3 hole-transporting layer (0.1 Å s−1, 10 nm) and Ag electrodes (0.5 Å s−1, 80 nm) were deposited by thermal evaporation under high vacuum (∼10−4 Pa) by using a metal mask. All the samples were encapsulated with a glass cap and UV-curable resin in a dry N2-filled glove box.
Measurements
The film thicknesses of ZnO and the photoactive layers were determined with a surface profiler (DEKTAK 6M, Bruker). The absorption, transmission, and reflection measurements were performed using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (V-650 and V-670, JASCO) with an integrating sphere. The surface morphology images of the patterned ZnO and photoactive layers were observed byAFM (5400, Agilent Technologies) in tapping mode. ZnO NP images were obtained by field emission-TEM (Tecnai G2 F30, FEI). The crystal structure of the ZnO NPs was measured with an X-ray diffractometer (SmartLab, Rigaku), and the reflection patterns were fitted with GlobalFit software (Rigaku). Monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) was generated at 45 kV and 200 mA. The optical constants of the materials were determined by spectral ellipsometry (FE-5000S, Photal).
The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured by using a source measurement unit (2400, Keithley) under simulated solar illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) from a solar simulator based on a 150 W Xe lamp (PEC-L11, Peccell Technologies). The light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell (BS520, Bunkoh-Keiki). The active area of each device was defined with a 0.12 cm2 metal photo mask. The EQE of each device was measured with monochromatic light (SM-250F, Bunkoh-Keiki).
Numerical calculation of optical properties
The light absorption was calculated by two-dimensional (2D) FEM with COMSOL Multiphysics. The incident light on the devices was assumed as plane waves of either transverse-magnetic (TM) or transverse-electric (TE) polarization at a normal incident angle, with a wavelength range of 300–900 nm. The calculation setup for the p-ZnO/p-Ag device is shown in Fig. S17a.† The profile of the grating patterns was reconstructed from the AFM images in Fig. 1. The front patterning on the ZnO layer and the back patterning on the Ag layer were arranged in parallel to make the model 2D. The dispersion properties of ITO, ZnO, the active layer (PTB7:PC71BM), and MoO3 were measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry. The refractive index, n, and extinction coefficient, k, for each layer used in this simulation are plotted in Fig. S17b.† For the glass substrate and Ag, we used the built-in material data in COMSOL.36 Periodic boundary conditions were set in the lateral direction, and the perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundary condition was applied at the top and bottom boundaries of the model. The transmittance, T, and the reflectance, R, of the device were calculated by integrating the divergence of the Poynting vector (power flow). The absorptance A was calculated by A = 1 −T−R with the correction from the surface reflection. To compare the absorption for f-ZnO/p-Ag, p-ZnO/f-Ag, and f-ZnO/f-Ag fairly, the total volumes of the active layer were equalized.
