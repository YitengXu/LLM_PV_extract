In this work, we report a low dopant content (1%) doping strategy to reveal the role of individual bromide and methylammonium (MA) in the intrinsic operational stability of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3-based) PSCs. This strategy enables us to tune the trap density of perovskite films while keeping their apparent morphological and optical properties unchanged. Our results demonstrate that the incorporation of MA into FAPbI3-based PSCs is harmful to their long-term stability due to defect-induced degradation. And Br incorporation is beneficial for enhancing the stability of FAPbI3-based PSCs via suppressing the trap density in perovskite films. This work highlights the importance of defect management in improving the long-term operational stability of perovskite solar cells.
Compositional engineering of organolead halide perovskites is the most important driving force for boosting the device performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs).1–12 Generally, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have a chemical formula of ABX3, where A is an organic cation, such as methylammonium (MA) or formamidinium (FA), B is lead or tin, and X is a halogen. Replacing MA in the A-site with slightly larger FA, i.e. FAPbI3, results in a more favourable bandgap of 1.47 eV than that of MAPbI3 (1.58 eV). And the lower bandgap represents a broader photoresponse range,13–15 which contributes to a larger photocurrent output for FAPbI3-based PSCs. Moreover, it is widely reported that the thermal stability of FAPbI3 is better than that of MAPbI3, as MA could be easily volatilized from the perovskite surface and result in degradation under thermal stress.16–18 It is found that the decomposition temperature of FAPbI3 (320 °C) is much higher than that of MAPbI3 (202 °C).16–18
As FAPbI3 possesses the α-phase (black perovskite) and δ-phase (yellow non-perovskite), and the δ-to-α phase-transition is an endothermic process,2 improving phase stability is of particular importance for developing stable FAPbI3 PSCs. FAPbI3 tends to form the hexagonal non-photoactive phase at room temperature because of the large ionic radius of FA+ (rFA = 253 pm). The Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t) is a reliable empirical index to assess the structural stability of perovskite materials. The Goldschmidt tolerance factor can be calculated by eqn (1): (1)where rA, rB, and rX are the ionic radius of the A-site, B-site, and X-site, respectively. The fact that δ-FAPbI3 adapts the hexagonal non-perovskite phase suggests that the corresponding Goldschmidt tolerance factor of δ-FAPbI3 is larger than 1. Incorporating a small amount of cesium cations (Cs+, ionic radius r = 181 pm) into the A-site, to partially replace FA+ (r = 253 pm), can form (FA1−xCsxPbI3) solid-state alloys. This method has been demonstrated to lower the temperature of the δ-to-α phase-transition from 165 °C (for pure FAPbI3) to below 100 °C (for FA1−xCsxPbI3).4,19 The slightly reduced t value is supposed to contribute to improving the device stability of Cs-doped FAPbI3 PSCs too. On the other hand, incorporating MA+ (r = 217 pm) to form FA1−xMAxPbI3 mixed-cation perovskites has also been reported to be an effective method to stabilize the α-phase.14 However, the needed amount of MA+ is much higher than that of Cs+, typically 60%,15 due to the smaller ionic radius difference between MA+ and FA+ than that of Cs+ and FA+. In addition to tuning the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, another effect of incorporating MA+ is increasing the entropy of mixed cation perovskites to stabilize the α-FAPbI3,20 as the rotational freedom is much higher in FAMA perovskites.17
Compared with A-site alloying, the effect of X-site incorporation on the phase stability of FAPbI3-based mixed perovskites is rather ambiguous. Jeon et al. reported a synergetic effect of MA+ and Br− to stabilize the perovskite phase, that is, the much better stabilizing ability of MAPbBr3 than MAPbI3 at the same MA/FA relative content.2 This emphasizes the effect of bromide doping on the phase stability of α-perovskite. However, its role cannot be explained by the tolerance factor tuning effect, because reducing rX will result in an increased t, resulting in a contrary effect to that of smaller A-site cation doping. On the other hand, incorporating bromide into the X-site to form I–Br mixed halide perovskites is reported to improve the thermal stability in MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 due to the shorter and stronger Pb–Br bond than Pb–I.21 However, this kind of mixed halide perovskite will undergo halide segregation into Br-rich domains and I-rich domains under light illumination, resulting in recombination centers and reduced photostability.22 In contrast, a mixed-cation and mixed-halide perovskite with the chemical composition of FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 shows excellent phase stability and photostability without a phase transition or halide segregation, and is a suitable top-cell material in perovskite–silicon tandem solar cells.23 Due to the different impacts of Br doping in different perovskite systems (with different cation compositions of MA, FAMA, and CsFA), the role of Br in the intrinsic stability of mixed-cation and mixed-halide perovskites is still under debate. The underlying origin of the difficulty to clarify this issue may lie in the fact that incorporating Br into the I-only perovskite not only modifies the halide composition, but also changes the bandgap, morphology and trap state level of the perovskite film. To reveal the effect of Br anions on the intrinsic stability of PSCs, the relative ratio of Br/I should be as low as possible to rule out the influence of the change of the basic properties of perovskite films caused by Br incorporation.
In this work, we report a low dopant content (1%) doping strategy to reveal the role of individual Br and MA in the device performance and intrinsic operational stability of FAPbI3-based PSCs. Cs-doped FAPbI3 (Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3) is used as the pristine sample (denoted as pristine CsFA) because it is reported that Cs is effective in inhibiting the α-to-δ phase-transition of FAPbI3.4,8,23 Incorporating 1% of CsPbBr3 into the pristine CsFA can form a Br-doped perovskite (denoted as CsFA–Br), and we are able to investigate the individual role of Br as the difference of Cs (5% in the pristine CsFA and 6% in the CsFA–Br) can be ignored. Further, incorporating 1% of MAPbBr3 into the pristine CsFA can form a Br- and MA-doped perovskite (denoted as CsFA–Br–MA), by which we can discuss the role of MA. Fig. 1a illustrates the crystal structure of cation and halide doped α-FAPbI3. Moreover, this low dopant content doping strategy enables us to obtain perovskite films with a similar morphology, phase composition, and bandgap. This makes us able to investigate the role of Br or MA in the intrinsic stability of PSCs while ruling out the composition change induced differences in basic film properties. By studying the properties of perovskite films and operational stability of PSCs with the chemical compositions of Cs0.05FA0.95PbI3 (pristine CsFA), Cs0.06FA0.94Pb(I0.99Br0.01)3 (CsFA–Br) and Cs0.05MA0.01FA0.94Pb(I0.99Br0.01)3 (CsFA–Br–MA), we demonstrate that Br doping is beneficial to enhance the stability of perovskite solar cells by reducing the initial trap state density in perovskite films. Because Br could induce preferential orientation of the (001) lattice plane in cubic FAPbI3, the incorporation of MA cations into CsFA–Br–MA induces a serious exponential performance decay under maximum power point (MPP) tracking, most likely due to the defect-induced interfacial degradation.

(e) Tauc plot, (f) PL spectra, and (g) XRD patterns of pristine and doped perovskite films. 
Perovskite films of pristine CsFA, CsFA–Br, and CsFA–Br–MA were prepared by spin-coating the corresponding precursor solution onto the substrate of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2via the typical one-step method (see Experimental details in the ESI†), where c-TiO2 and m-TiO2 are compact TiO2 and mesoporous TiO2, respectively. The surface morphology of these three perovskite films was first examined because it directly determines the performance and stability of PSCs. SEM images in Fig. 1b–d show that the surface coverage, grain size, and surface roughness of these three samples are similar to each other, which implies that incorporating 1% of CsPbBr3 or MAPbBr3 does not alter the morphology of CsFA-based perovskite films. The bandgaps of pristine CsFA, CsFA–Br, and CsFA–Br–MA extracted from Tauc plots in Fig. 1e are 1.54, 1.55, and 1.55 eV, respectively. The open circuit voltage (VOC) of PSCs can be expressed by eqn (2):24 (2)where Eg, kB, T, NC, NV, n, and p are the bandgap of the perovskite, the Boltzmann constant, the temperature, the density of states in the conduction band, the density of states in the valence band, the charge carrier density of electrons, and the charge carrier density of holes, respectively. This equation shows clearly that VOC scales with Eg, and it is limited by recombination which reduces the carrier density of electrons and holes. The change of Eg induced by 1% doping of CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 is within 0.01 eV, indicating that negligible influence on the VOC of PSCs resulted from the first term in eqn (2). Photoluminescence spectra in Fig. 1f further show that incorporating 1% of CsPbBr3 or MAPbBr3 only results in a slight blue-shift of the PL peak from 800 to 799 nm, which is consistent with the unapparent shift of Eg. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was employed to investigate the influence of 1% doping of CsPbBr3 or MAPbBr3 on the structure and phase of perovskite films (Fig. 1g). XRD peaks located at about 14.0° represent the diffraction of (001) planes of the α-phase perovskite,17 while the weak peaks at 12.7° indicate a small amount of PbI2 excess in the perovskite films. It is noteworthy that no XRD peaks of δ non-perovskite (11.6°) are observed in all of the three perovskite samples. This indicates that all of the three perovskite recipes can be successfully applied to prepare α-phase pure FAPbI3-based perovskite films. These results demonstrate that the incorporation of 1% CsPbBr3 or MAPbBr3 does not alter the structure and phase composition of perovskite films.
The fact that the morphological and optical properties of the pristine and doped perovskite films keep unchanged makes us able to investigate the chemical compositional effect of Br or MA on the performance and intrinsic stability of PSCs. However, it is reported that traps in the perovskite active layer strongly affect the VOC of PSCs,24 so the trap density level should also be checked before discussing the compositional effects of the perovskite on the performance and stability of PSCs. Space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements were performed to estimate the trap density in the as-prepared perovskite films of pristine CsFA, CsFA–Br, and CsFA–Br–MA. Simplified devices with the configuration of FTO/Perovskite/Au were first fabricated and the corresponding dark I–V characteristics were measured. As shown in Fig. 2a, the I–V curves in the double logarithmic scale show a linear region and nonlinear region connected with a kink-point, known as the trap-filled limit voltage VTFL, which is related to the trap density of the measured semiconductor materials by eqn (3): (3)where ε0, ε, e, and L are the vacuum permittivity, the relative permittivity, the elementary charge, and the thickness of the perovskite film, respectively. As the thickness of the perovskite films is ∼500 nm and the relative permittivity is ∼35,25 the trap state density of the pristine CsFA, CsFA–Br, and CsFA–Br–MA perovskite films is 2.74 × 1016, 2.11 × 1016, and 2.33 × 1016 cm−3, respectively. These results indicate that the incorporation of both CsPbBr3 and MAPbBr3, although the doping ratio is as low as 1%, can reduce the trap state density in perovskite films. This effect can be assigned to the contribution of bromide because the CsFA–Br film exhibits much lower trap density than that of pristine CsFA, while both CsFA–Br, and CsFA–Br–MA demonstrate comparable trap density levels. The dependence of trap density in the perovskite films on the Br content was further investigated by SCLC and the results are shown in Fig. S1 and Table S1.† The results reveal that the introduction of low Br content (1%, 4%, and 6%) suppressed the trap density. However, beyond the Br fraction (6%), the perovskite films exhibited an increase in trap density for Br fractions of 9% and 12%. The opposite effect of Br doping at high doping content is most likely due to the inferior morphology of perovskite films with high Br content. After carefully examining the XRD patterns of the three perovskite films with the doping ratio of 1% in Fig. 1g, we find that the relative peak intensity of (001)/(011) gradually increases in the series of pristine CsFA, CsFA–Br–MA, and CsFA–Br, which indicates the preferential orientation of the (001) lattice plane after MAPbBr3 and CsPbBr3 doping. We argue that the suppression of trap states after incorporation of a small amount of bromide into the pristine CsFA perovskite film is possibly due to the Br-induced preferential orientation of (001) lattice planes in cubic FAPbI3.

To investigate the dependence of solar cell performance on trap density in perovskite films, we fabricated mesoporous n–i–p PSCs with the device configuration of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au using perovskite recipes of pristine CsFA, CsFA–Br, and CsFA–Br–MA. The device structure can be confirmed by the cross-sectional SEM image of a typical full device in Fig. S2a.†J–V curves of the freshly fabricated PSCs were measured in the reverse scan direction (from 1.2 to −0.2 V) without any preconditioning (Fig. 2b). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) determined from the J–V scans is 13.08% (with JSC = 24.65 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.998 V, and FF = 0.532), 18.00% (with JSC = 24.40 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.043 V, and FF = 0.707), and 13.67% (with JSC = 24.39 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.004 V, and FF = 0.558) for pristine CsFA, CsFA–Br, and CsFA–Br–MA, respectively. Detailed photovoltaic parameters extracted from the J–V curves are summarized in Table S2.† Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured to evaluate the JSC accuracy of the J–V curves. As shown in Fig. S2b,† IPCE spectra for all of the three devices exhibit a photoresponse in the spectral region of 300 to 850 nm with a peak IPCE value as high as 90%. The integrated JSC from the IPCE spectra under AM 1.5G illumination for pristine CsFA, CsFA–Br, and CsFA–Br–MA is 23.47, 23.56, and 23.22 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in good agreement with the corresponding JSC values of 24.65 (4.8% discrepancy), 24.39 (4.8% discrepancy), and 24.40 (3.4% discrepancy) mA cm−2 in Table S2.† Similar photoresponses and JSC values of the three examined perovskite solar cells are predictable, as these three perovskites possess similar optical and morphological properties. Fig. S3† shows the statistical distribution of photovoltaic parameters from one batch of 14 PCSs, which clearly shows that the average VOC improved from 0.989 to 1.015, and 0.991 V for pristine CsFA, CsFA–Br, and CsFA–Br–MA, respectively; and average FF from 0.428 to 0.591, and 0.430. The improvement of VOC and FF after Br and/or MA incorporation is most likely due to the suppression of trap-mediated nonradiative recombination. These results demonstrate that the trap density in the perovskite film influences the initial device performance of PSCs.
To further investigate the role of Br-incorporation induced trap state tuning in the device performance, we examined the J–V characteristic of the devices after preconditioning under simulated sunlight. Continuous light illumination upon the freshly prepared PSCs can reduce the bulk defects in the perovskite active layer and interfacial defects in the interface of the perovskite/selective contact, known as the light soaking effect, which results in improvement of VOC and FF.26 The J–V curves of the PSCs after light soaking are presented in Fig. 2c, which gives a PCE of 20.16% (with JSC = 25.02 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.052 V, and FF = 0.765), 20.36% (with JSC = 24.91 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.053 V, and FF = 0.776), and 20.22% (with JSC = 24.94 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.052 V, and FF = 0.771) for pristine CsFA, CsFA–Br, and CsFA–Br–MA. The detailed photovoltaic parameters extracted from the J–V curves are shown in Table S3.† It is observed that the improvement of VOC and FF after light soaking for CsFA–Br (VOC increases from 1.043 to 1.053 V and FF increases from 0.707 to 0.776) is not as significant as that of pristine CsFA (VOC increases from 0.998 to 1.052 V and FF increases from 0.558 to 0.765) and CsFA–Br–MA (VOC increases from 1.004 to 1.052 V and FF increases from 0.558 to 0.771). The statistical distribution of photovoltaic parameters for PSCs after light soaking is shown in Fig. S4,† which demonstrates higher reproducibility compared with the freshly prepared devices. These results indicate that the light soaking effect strongly depends on the trap density level of the freshly prepared perovskite film, which can be tuned by the perovskite recipe. The hysteresis effect of the aged devices is studied by measuring J–V curves from both reverse and forward directions, and recording the stabilized power output. As shown in Fig. S5,† these devices demonstrate comparable hysteresis. To investigate the influence of Br and MA doping content on the device performance, we fabricated PSCs with different contents of Br and/or MA and measured their J–V curves. The results are presented in Fig. S6 and S7.† The corresponding photovoltaic parameters (Tables S4 and S5†) demonstrate that the introduction of a low content of Br (1%, 4%, and 6%) and MA (1%, 6%) improved the photovoltaic efficiency. However, beyond the Br (6%) and MA (6%) fraction, the perovskite devices exhibited a drop in efficiency for Br fractions of 9% and 12% and for MA fractions of 10% and 12%. The best doping content of Br and MA is 6%, which delivers a device PCE of 20.93% and 20.79%, respectively. Note that in the case of CsPbBr3 doping, the content of Cs is also varied and its influence cannot be ignored as the doping content becomes higher. Similarly, in the case of MAPbBr3 doping, both contents of MA and Br change.
The dependence of JSC and VOC on incident light density for the aged devices is investigated for pristine CsFA, CsFA–Br, and CsFA–Br–MA after light soaking. The light intensity is varied from 0.013 sun to 1 sun using a solar simulator. As shown in Fig. S8,† the logarithm of JSC increases linearly with the logarithm of light intensity (JSC ∝ Iα, where I is the light intensity and α is the slope of logJSCversus logI), and it gives α values of near unity (0.976, 0.977, and 0.976 for pristine CsFA, CsFA–Br, and CsFA–Br–MA, respectively). This indicates that all excited carriers are collected before recombination under short circuit conditions.27 Moreover, the fact that all α values are near unity other than 0.75 reveals that there is no serious interfacial barrier in all devices.27 The light dependence of VOC shown in Fig. 2d shows that in all of the varied light intensity ranges, VOC values of devices with lower initial trap density in the perovskite film are higher than those of the ones with higher trap density. However, the ideal factor values of n are similar to each other (1.74, 1.68, and 1.63 for pristine CsFA, CsFA–Br, and CsFA–Br–MA, respectively), indicating that the levels of nonradiative trap-assisted recombination are comparable among these aged devices. To investigate the charge transfer and recombination in the devices, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) study of PSCs of pristine CsFA, CsFA–Br, and CsFA–Br–MA under short circuit conditions was performed. As the measured device performance of the PSCs with different dopants after light-soaking are similar, we studied the carrier behavior under low light intensity (0.01 sun) to emphasize the dopant effect. EIS spectra in Fig. S9† demonstrate that Br doping reduces the charge transfer resistance and enhances the recombination resistance while MA doping induces the opposite effect. This behavior is most likely caused by the trap density difference in the PSCs.
Previous reports have demonstrated that the light stability of PSCs under moisture, oxygen, and thermal stress conditions is heavily influenced by the presence of charged traps.28 The light-induced degradation of PSCs under environmental conditions can be obviously accelerated by the traps.29,30 Here, we would like to discuss the role of traps in the intrinsic stability of PSCs (without moisture and oxygen). Due to the ionic nature of organolead halide perovskites, the defect states in the polycrystalline films are inevitably electrically charged.28 During the practical operation of PSCs under an electrical field and light illumination, the charged traps are expected to be accumulated at the interfaces between the perovskite active layer and charge carrier selective materials, which causes unfavourable band bending, reduces the carrier extraction efficiency, and results in inferior stability of PSCs. This motivates us to investigate the influence of trap state density in perovskite films on the intrinsic long-term operational stability of PSCs.
The intrinsic long-term stability of PSCs based on pristine CsFA, CsFA–Br, and CsFA–Br–MA is investigated by monitoring the evolution of their device performance (PCE, JSC, VOC, and FF) with the operation time under maximum power point (MPP) tracking. These measurements were carried out in a N2-filled glovebox under a white LED lamp with a power intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Moisture and oxygen are ruled out in this condition for ease of discussing the intrinsic stability of PSCs as a function of the chemical composition of perovskites. The evolution of PCE in the time scale of 1000 h is presented in Fig. 3a. An initial exponential decay (the so-called ‘burn-in’ exponential degradation phase31), highlighted by the magenta circle, is observed for all of the devices. This initial decay component is generally recoverable if the aged device is left in the dark.31 The evolution of JSC, VOC, and FF is shown in Fig. 3b, c, and d, respectively. For pristine CsFA and CsFA–Br, the decay trace of PCE in the ‘burn-in’ region follows the trend of VOC, while no obvious degradation of JSC and FF was observed. In contrast, for CsFA–Br–MA, the initial exponential decay is caused by the loss of VOC, JSC, and FF. We attribute this fast decay component to the electromigration of charged defects to the interface of the perovskite/selective contact, which results in unfavourable energy level alignment and reduced VOC. The charged defects that accumulated at the interface can diffuse back into the bulk of the perovskite film if the devices are left in the dark for enough time. The relatively faster drop of PCE for CsFA–Br–MA caused by further loss of FF and JSC is most likely due to the inferior stability of the bulk and interface of MA-based perovskites, in which pinholes usually emerge in the device after operation at MPP as reported by our previous work.32 Following the ‘burn-in’ drop is a more linear decrease region in the time range of 100 to 500 h. In this linear region, the behavior of pristine CsFA, CsFA–Br, and CsFA–Br–MA is similar to each other. The most interesting performance loss characteristic lies in the time region between 500 and 1000 h. As shown in Fig. 3a, the performance drop for devices with higher trap density is faster than the ones with fewer traps in this region. This indicates that although the initial shallow traps in the perovskite films can be filled by photoexcited carriers, the intrinsic long-term operational stability of PSCs can be influenced by the excess of injected charges (with opposite charge to the defects). These results indicate that incorporation of MA into FAPbI3-based PSCs is harmful to long-term stability when ignoring its effect on inhibiting the α-to-δ phase transition, and Br incorporation is beneficial to enhance the stability of FAPbI3-based PSCs via suppressing the trap density in the perovskite films. This emphasizes the importance of compositional engineering and defect engineering in improving the long-term stability of PSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, we have revealed insights into the role of compositional engineering of bromide anions and methylammonium cations in the performance and intrinsic long-term stability of FAPbI3-based perovskite solar cells. By incorporating 1% of Br or Br–MA into the pristine CsFA perovskite, we have successfully tuned the trap state density while keeping the morphology and the optical properties of perovskite films unchanged. This strategy enables us to study the compositional effect on the performance and stability of PSCs while ruling out the apparent properties of perovskite films. Our results have demonstrated that the trap density in perovskite films strongly influences the initial efficiency of freshly prepared devices. On further filling the traps through the light soaking process, the devices can achieve comparable performance. The incorporation of a small amount of MA distinctly accelerated the initial exponential performance decay, which was most likely due to the defect-induced interfacial degradation. Moreover, traps in the perovskite films are found to be harmful to the intrinsic long-term operational stability of PSCs by accelerating the performance decay in the stage following the linear decay region. This work emphasizes the importance of suppressing shallow defects in promoting the intrinsic long-term operational stability of PSCs.
