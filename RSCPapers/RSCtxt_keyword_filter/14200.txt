, Accepted 22nd January 2016First published on 28th January 2016AbstractWe report the effect of the non-conjugated 5-position substituent of pyrazoline-based photosensitizers on the photophysical characteristics and performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Four photosensitizers which contained different para-substituted phenyl groups (dimethylamine (6a), hexyloxy (6b), ethyl ester (6c), and no substituent (6d)) at the 5-position were synthesized. Although these substituents were not part of the conjugated π-system of the pyrazoline, their absorption maxima showed a red shift from 496 to 510 nm with increasing electron-donating ability. The same trend was observed for their electrochemical characteristics: the oxidation potentials decreased from 1.14 to 0.97 V. In terms of DSSC performance, 6a, which had a strongly electron donating substituent at the 5-position, delivered the highest short-circuit current (Jsc) of 12.3 mA cm−2, an incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) as high as 75%, and the best power conversion efficiency (PCE, η) of 5.7% under AM 1.5 G conditions. Further investigation with the stepped light-induced photocurrent and voltage transients (SLIM-PCV) method revealed that the steric differences between the groups at the 5-position clearly influenced the recombination reaction, resulting in the highest Voc of 636 mV in the DSSC employing 6a with the bulky dimethylamine substituent.
1. Introduction
Over the past few decades, photosensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been extensively investigated in order to expand their use as flexible, portable, and colorful photoenergy-conversion applications.1,2 Although worldwide interest in the development of perovskite-based solar cells has grown recently,3,4 DSSCs still attract much attention in the light-harvesting device market for use under room lighting. Among DSSCs, photosensitizers based on ruthenium complexes have achieved the best power conversion efficiencies (PCE, η), exceeding 11% as measured by the standard method (with over 1 cm2 illumination area), which are comparable to the PCE values of amorphous silicon solar cells.5,6 However, in terms of practical applications, ruthenium is a scarce resource and can be expensive. Owing to these limitations, considerable effort has gone into developing ruthenium-free photosensitizers. The key strategy for synthesizing ruthenium-free photosensitizers with high PCEs is the design of donor–π–acceptor structures which enable the efficient transfer of electrons from an electron-donating group to an electron-withdrawing group anchored to the surface of TiO2.7 In addition, strong intramolecular charge transfer allows for the realization of light absorption over a wide range, spanning the entire visible region. Based on this ideal model, a number of D–π–A photosensitizers have been prepared, including coumarins,8 cyanines,9–11 carbazoles,12–16 triphenylamines,17 and indolines18 as donors. The resulting DSSCs with organic photosensitizers have exhibited PCE values of over 10%,19,20 approaching those of the ruthenium-based photosensitizers.
Pyrazoline compounds have been widely investigated in bioorganic chemistry,21–26 and utilized as optical brighteners, chemical sensors, and organic electronic materials.27–34 Surprisingly, in spite of these attractive optical and electronic characteristics, pyrazolines have never been prepared as photosensitizers for DSSCs.
One of specific advantages of pyrazolines is that various substituents can be introduced into the 1-, 3-, and 5-positions of the five-membered ring during synthesis (Chart 1). Thus, in the design of D–π–A structures incorporating pyrazolines for DSSCs, selecting the appropriate sites for the donor and acceptor units from among the three positions is the initial step. Preliminarily, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations for simple pyrazoline photosensitizers employing cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor unit in each position. The results revealed that the donor and acceptor units should be located at the 1- and 3-positions, respectively, in order to accomplish effective electron transfer. Taking all of these considerations into account, we developed a series of pyrazoline photosensitizers. Specifically, in this paper, we report the effect of the substituent at the 5-position on the photophysical properties and DSSC performance using four novel photosensitizers (Fig. 1). The core structure of these photosensitizers consists of 4-(6-methylbenzothiazol-2-yl)phenyl as the donor unit, commonly used cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor unit, and bithiophene as the π-bridge. Among the series of donor units we developed, 4-(6-methylbenzothiazol-2-yl)phenyl satisfied our requirement for low-cost mass production. The precursor of the donor unit, 4-(6-methylbenzothiazol-2-yl)phenyl hydrazine, is easily synthesized starting from toluidine, followed by dehydrothio-p-toluidine, which has been widely utilized as a key intermediate and chromophore for dyes and pigments. At the 5-position, para-substituted phenyl groups with different electronic characters (dimethylamino (NMe2), hexyloxy (OC6H13), and ethyl ester (COOEt)) and the unsubstituted compound (H) were used. To elucidate the effect of the 5-position substituent, photophysical and electrochemical characterization and photovoltaic performance were investigated. Furthermore, to evaluate the recombination reaction, we investigated the electron lifetimes of the DSSCs.35–37

2. Experimental section
Photosensitizer characterization
1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 MHz system. Chemical shifts are expressed in ppm using CDCl3, DMSO-d6, and acetone-d6 as an internal standard. UV/vis measurements were performed with a Shimadzu UV-3101PC spectrometer in dilute solution. Oxidation potentials were obtained by differential pulse voltammetry with a BioLogic SP-300 system using a three-electrode cell consisting of a Pt-deposited fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass counter electrode, a dye-sensitized TiO2 film on an FTO glass working electrode, and a Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode. The potentials were calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple. Elemental analyses were performed with a Thermo Fisher Scientific FLASH 2000 CHNS/O analyzer. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data were obtained with a Thermo Fisher Scientific Exactive™ system.
DSSC fabrication
The photoanodes were prepared by screen-printing a transparent layer of 20 nm TiO2 particles (4 μm thick, 18NR-T, Dyesol) onto FTO conducting glass (Nippon Sheet Glass) pre-treated with 0.04 M aq. TiCl4. The screen printed TiO2 layer was sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. For an optimized TiO2 layer, a scattering layer of 400 nm TiO2 particles (3 μm thick, PST-400C, Catalysts & Chemicals Industries Co., Ltd.) was coated on the transparent layer, and after sintering, the double TiO2 layer was treated with 0.01 M aq. TiCl4 as a post-treatment. Before immersion in the dye bath (concentration: 0.3 mM in toluene) at 30 °C for 18 h, the photoanodes were sintered again at 450 °C for 30 min. The counter electrodes, comprising FTO conducting glass into which two holes had been drilled, were platinized by the heat deposition of hexachloroplatinic acid. Cell fabrication was carried out by thermally sealing the layers together with 35 μm-thick Surlyn®. The electrolyte was injected into the cell from the holes in the counter electrodes, and the holes were sealed with Surlyn® and a cover glass. All photovoltaic characteristics were measured using an electrolyte consisting of 0.6 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 0.05 M iodin 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine, and 0.1 M lithium iodide in acetonitrile (MeCN).
Measurements
The photocurrent–voltage characteristics were measured using a WACOM WXS-80C-3 solar simulator equipped with an AM 1.5 G filter and an ADVANTEST R6243 source/monitor. The light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated using a reference silicon photovoltaic cell. A metal mask with an aperture area of 0.16 cm2 was used to normalize the active area. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured with a Bunko Keiki CEP-99W system. The stepped light-induced photocurrent and voltage transients (SLIM-PCV) method was used to obtain the electron lifetimes, and the charge extraction technique was performed to evaluate the charge densities.38 To calculate the charge density, the TiO2 film thickness was exactly measured with a KLA Tencor Alpha-Step 500 system. The dye loading on TiO2 was determined by the amount of desorbed dye from the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes with tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH, 10% aq.)/THF solution.
3. Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic route for the pyrazoline photosensitizers is shown in Scheme 1. As previously reported, the pyrazoline core was easily synthesized via two condensations.39–41 Initially, multi-functionalized chalcones 3a–d were prepared through the Claisen–Schmidt condensation in the presence of NaOH at ambient temperature. In the case of compound 3c, the direct condensation of 1 and ethyl-4-formylbenzoate produced a mixture containing a deprotected compound owing to hydrolysis under the basic conditions. Therefore, a carboxyl-substituted chalcone was prepared first; subsequent esterification with bromoethane successfully afforded 3c. Condensation of chalcones 3a–d with 4-(6-methylbenzothiazol-2-yl)phenylhydrazine under acidic conditions yielded the pyrazoline cores 4a–d. To extend the π-bridge of the pyrazolines, another thiophene unit was introduced by a Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction, leading to the aldehyde-functionalized D–π units 5a–d. Finally, the introduction of the acceptor unit by the Knoevenagel reaction of the aldehydes with 2-cyanoacetic acid in the presence of piperidine gave novel photosensitizers 6a–d. All new compounds were confirmed by NMR, elemental analysis, and HRMS (see ESI for details†).

Photophysical and electrochemical properties of the photosensitizers
The absorption spectra of the photosensitizers were measured as solutions in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and as adsorbed on a TiO2 film. Fig. 2 shows the solution absorption spectra and Table 1 summarizes the photophysical data. The photosensitizers in solution show similar absorption spectra in the visible light region, with two bands at approximately 390 and 510 nm tailing up to 610 nm. For all the photosensitizers, higher-energy bands corresponding to π–π* transitions are observed in almost the same region at 390 nm. For the lower energy bands, corresponding to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions, the absorption maxima are red-shifted in the order 6a (510 nm) > 6b (505 nm) > 6d (502 nm) > 6c (496 nm). Interestingly, this order is related to the electron-donating ability of the 5-position phenyl substituent, NMe2 > OC6H13 > H > COOEt, even though it does not contribute directly to the conjugated π–system along the 1- through 3-positions. This tendency was also found in the optical band-gap (Eg) widening, which occurred in the order 6a (2.04 eV) < 6b (2.05 eV) < 6c and 6d (2.06 eV), indicating the weakening of the electron-donating ability. These values were estimated from the onset of the absorption spectra of a sensitized thin TiO2 film (see ESI†). This might suggest that the electronic nature of the substituent at the 5-position of the pyrazoline ring has an influence on the ICT interaction between the donor at the 1-position and the acceptor at the 3-position.

To further investigate the effect of the 5-position substituent, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was performed to understand the differences in the oxidation potentials, i.e., the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels, of the photosensitizers. All potentials were obtained against a Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAClO4) in MeCN, and calibrated with the Fc/Fc+ redox couple (0.62 V versus NHE).42,43 To observe the electrochemical behaviors under the same conditions as in the DSSCs, a dye-sensitized TiO2 film on FTO glass was used as the working electrode. The oxidation potentials (Eox) are listed in Table 2. The order of the oxidation potentials from low to high was 6a, 6b, 6d, and 6c. This result indicates that the HOMO levels are influenced by the electronic nature of the 5-position substituent; thus, the electron-donating NMe2 unit in 6a affords 0.17 V lower oxidation energy than that of 6c.

The HOMO levels of all the photosensitizers are satisfactorily more positive than the redox potential of I−/I3− (0.37 V versus NHE), to regenerate the oxidized photosensitizers.44 The reduction potentials (Ered) corresponding to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) must be more negative than the conduction band edge level of TiO2 (−0.5 V versus NHE) to ensure sufficient charge injection.8 The LUMO levels, estimated from the equation Eox − Eg, were low enough for charge injection to TiO2 for all the photosensitizers. Among them, 6a possessed the greatest charge injection driving force of 0.57 V and a longer absorption-onset wavelength, leading to an increased photocurrent.
Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs with the four photosensitizers was measured under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2). To elucidate the performance differences among the photosensitizers, a 4 μm-thick transparent single-layer TiO2 film was used for the photoanode without TiCl4 post-treatment to eliminate other effects, except for the electronic and structural effects from the photosensitizers themselves.
The current density (J)–voltage (V) curves are shown in Fig. 3, and the typical photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 3. All data were obtained with high reproducibility, and the average data are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The short-circuit currents (Jsc) are consistent with the electron-donating ability of the 5-position substituent. The highest value (10.3 mA cm−2) was obtained in the cell employing 6a, whereas that of 6c was the lowest (8.85 mA cm−2). The IPCE spectra are shown in Fig. 4. The highest IPCE values from 400 to 600 nm of 6a and 6b are comparable, and the highest among the present photosensitizers. These results indicate that the highest Jsc of 6a is due to the absorption onset found in the longest wavelength of all the photosensitizers. In the case of 6c, the lower IPCE value at around 450 nm than that of 6b and slightly narrower spectrum than 6d decreases its photocurrent, resulting in the lowest Jsc. On the other hand, since there is no correlation between the highest value of the IPCE and the molar extinction coefficient, the electron injection efficiency or the reduction efficiency of the oxidized photosensitizers might influence the IPCE values. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) values are 654, 640, 625, and 621 mV for 6a, 6b, 6c, and 6d, respectively; also, the onset voltages of the dark currents are ordered 6a > 6b > 6c > 6d. These results clearly indicate that there is no correlation with the electron-donating ability of the 5-position substituent. To explain the difference in the Voc values among the photosensitizers, we investigated the charge recombination process.

Charge recombination
The SLIM-PCV and charge extraction methods are powerful tools for obtaining information on the charge recombination reaction at the interface between TiO2 and the electrolyte. It is well known that the charge recombination process is a crucial contributor to the Voc value. The electron concentration in TiO2 significantly decreases with the recombination reaction in the DSSC. Therefore, recombination leads to a positive shift of the Fermi level in TiO2, resulting in a decrease of Voc with decreasing offset potential between the electrolyte redox potential and the Fermi level. Thus, observing the charge recombination process is important for improving DSSC performance. Fig. 5 shows the electron lifetime and the open-circuit voltage versus electron density of the DSSCs. The same tested cells were used as for the measurement of photovoltaic performance. Fig. 5a presents the data for the relationship between Voc and the electron density for all the photosensitizers. These results indicate that the conduction band edge level of TiO2 is not changed by the adsorbed photosensitizers. In the relationship between the electron lifetime versus electron density, the electron lifetime increases in the order 6a > 6b > 6c > 6d. The longer electron lifetime of 6a is probably derived from the steric effects of the dimethylamino group on the 5-position substituent. Compared to the linear substituent of 6b, the sterically bulky substituent of 6a prevents iodide ions from approaching the TiO2 surface, leading to suppression of the charge recombination and the improvement of Voc in the J–V curves.45 In the cases of 6c and 6d, the less bulky or absent substituent on the phenyl ring cannot prevent charge recombination. In addition, the shorter electron lifetimes of 6c and 6d might be the cause of the slightly lower dye loading on TiO2 than that of 6a. As expected, the lower dye coverage of the TiO2 surface for 6c and 6d unfavorably provides both electron-leakage and electrolyte-approaching paths, which enable a greater degree of charge recombination and result in the decreasing Voc.

Finally, to investigate the best photovoltaic performance using the pyrazoline-based photosensitizers, DSSCs consisting of transparent and scattering TiO2 photoanode layers were prepared. Fig. 6 shows their J–V curves, and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S2.† With a broad absorption and a bulky substituent, the highest Jsc of 12.3 mA cm−2 and Voc of 636 mV were obtained with 6a, resulting in the best PCE of 5.7%.

4. Conclusion
In this work, we successfully synthesized new photosensitizers based on a 1,3,5-triaryl-2-pyrazoline core for DSSCs, and focused on investigating the effects of the 5-position substituent. We found that the electronic nature of the 5-position substituent had a significant influence on the photophysical and electrochemical characteristics of the DSSCs, even though it is not a part of the conjugated system of the pyrazoline. The absorption maxima and onset shifted toward longer wavelengths in the order NMe2 (6a) > OC6H13 (6b) > H (6d) > COOEt (6c). With the broader light absorption of 6a, the DSSC with 6a showed the highest Jsc. To increase the photocurrent, the electronic characteristics of the pyrazoline-based photosensitizers can be tuned by modifying the substituent at the 5-position without altering the entire conjugated system. We also found that the structural effects of the 5-position substituent are important to improving the Voc. The electron lifetime measurements showed that the bulky substituent of 6a suppresses the recombination reaction, resulting in the highest Voc of 636 mV. The DSSC with 6a showed the highest PCE of 5.7% with a double-layer TiO2 electrode.
Although the structures of the pyrazoline photosensitizers were not fully optimized for DSSCs in this work, promising performance improvements were obtained. With these results, we will continue our research to develop high-performance pyrazoline photosensitizers.
