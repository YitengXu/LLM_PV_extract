    , Accepted 1st September 2018First published on 3rd September 2018AbstractSquaraines have been demonstrated as one class of effective low-bandgap donor materials in bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs). However, they often suffer from low hole mobility, thereby limiting their photovoltaic performance. Herein, we designed and synthesized three new butterfly-shaped dimeric squaraines (DSQ1–3) with an extended π-conjugated system for BHJ-OSCs. Our results reveal that the modification of connecting bridges between two asymmetric dyes has a minimal effect on their absorption, energy levels and charge transport properties, however, subtle side chain modifications can efficiently improve the charge transport ability in the BHJ films due to enhanced miscibility with fullerene acceptors. By simply replacing the hexyl chains in the fluorene core of DSQ1 by branched 2-ethylhexyl chains, the resulting DSQ3 could possess a hole mobility of 1.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, providing an ∼6 times enhancement of that of DSQ1. Thus, as donor materials in single-junction BHJ-OSCs, DSQ3 afforded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.02%, while that of DSQ1 was only 2.26%. Moreover, the 2-hexyldecyl substituted carbazole cored DSQ2 showed slightly higher hole mobility than DSQ3, and thus generated the highest PCE of 4.38% among the three dimers. Our work strengthens the importance of side chain engineering for designing high-performance squaraine-based donor materials, even for those already having a large π-conjugated system.
Introduction
Recently, solution-processed bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 14.0% have been realized,1–3 largely due to the continuous innovation of material designs including p-type, n-type and interfacial semiconducting materials.4–10 For p-type donor materials used in BHJ-OSCs, significant efforts have been devoted to lowering their bandgap to allow more efficient absorption of solar light, given almost half of all solar irradiation energy comes from the near-infrared (NIR) region.11,12 So far, one of the most successful design strategies is to utilize donor–acceptor (D–A) type π-conjugated scaffolds that can enable efficient intermolecular charge transfer interactions along the scaffold. In this context, a large variety of D–A type low-bandgap π-conjugated semiconductors have been developed by carefully integrating different donor–acceptor subunits; however, most of them consist of fused and multiple ring systems with high synthetic complexity,13 thereby limiting their further practical applications. Alternatively, organic dyes14–16 including dipyrromethene boron difluoride (BODIPY),17,18 diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),19 merocyanines20,21 and squaraines22 have also emerged as effective low-bandgap donor materials for BHJ-OSCs, due to their low synthetic cost and intense absorption in the NIR region.
Squaraines, as a peculiar class of zwitterionic cyanine dyes with a quadrupolar D–A–D structure, can be easily prepared via 1,3-dicondensation reactions.23 In addition to having strong and broad absorption in the vis-NIR region (ε > 105 M−1 cm−1), they also present remarkable photochemical and thermal stability under ambient conditions, and fascinating aggregation features in both solutions and solid states,23–25 making them attractive in many optoelectric fields including nonlinear optics,26,27 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),28,29 and OSCs.30–42 In 2008, Marks and Pagari et al. first reported the use of squaraines as low bandgap donor materials in BHJ-OSCs with a PCE of 1.24%.43 Since then, continuous progress has been made in this field, and a best PCE of 7.05% was recently demonstrated based on single-junction cells.38 Besides, squaraines have also been employed for fabricating high-performance ternary or quaternary BHJ-OSCs with PCEs over 10% through forming multiple Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pairs and/or acting as co-crystalline agents.44,45
As is well known, the device efficiency of OSCs is basically determined by three factors: open-circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). So far, most FFs of squaraine-based OSCs remain at a relatively low level, generally below 50%, which is currently a key problem required to be addressed in this field.22 A major reason for these low FFs is the low hole mobility of squaraines, typically ∼10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which often results in a strong bimolecular recombination.46 Besides, the compatibility between squaraines and fullerene acceptors also needs to be taken into account, given large phase separation may resulted from their strong self-aggregation.47,48 To solve these challenges, new molecular design strategies are highly required. In this manner, incorporation of squaraines into a large π-extended conjugated system has been demonstrated as an effective way to improve their hole mobility and thus the photovoltaic performance.37,38,49 For example, Kido et al. recently reported a new class of dimeric squaraines through using benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) as the bridging units, which can afford hole mobilities as high as 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and thus high PCEs over 7% have been achieved based on single-junction BHJ-OSCs.37,38
Inspired by these encouraging results, in this work, we designed and synthesized three new butterfly-shaped squaraine dimers (DSQ1–3, Chart 1) as low-bandgap donor materials (∼1.6 eV) in BHJ-OSCs. Fluorene and carbazole moieties with different substituted alkyl chains were chosen as the bridging units to connect two asymmetric squaraines, due to their good planarity, but also more facile synthetic access compared to other reported fused ring systems like BDT and IDTT.37,38 We have systematically studied the impact of the structural variations on the photophysical properties and photovoltaic performance of the dimers, and demonstrated that the side chain modifications can result in a more pronounced change in their final material properties than the bridge modifications in our molecular system. As donor materials in additive-free fullerene-based BHJ-OSCs, remarkable differences in the device performance were realized, with a PCE of 2.26% for DSQ1, 4.38% for DSQ2 and 4.02% for DSQ3, and the higher PCEs for DSQ2 and 3 could be ascribed to their enhanced hole mobility in BHJ films.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic route of DSQ1–3 is shown in Scheme 1, while the details are provided in the Experimental section. To form our desired dimeric structure, it is critical to prepare the central dimeric end-groups. Herein, triarylamine derivatives are chosen as the building blocks of dimeric end-groups, due to their well-recognized abilities of improving charge carrier transport and tuning molecular frontier orbital energy levels.30,50,51 As shown in Scheme 1a, compounds 4 and 5 were synthesized via a typical Buchwald–Hartwig cross coupling reaction under the catalysis of Pd2(dba)3 between fluorene/carbazole moieties (1 and 2) and 3,5-dimethoxy-N-phenylaniline (3) with a high yield over 90%. Then, in the presence of BBr3, the methoxy groups can be easily deprotected to yield dimeric end-groups (6 and 7). After that, they further underwent a simple condensation reaction with semi-squaraine (8) to afford our desired products, DSQ1 and DSQ2, with a yield of 28% and 66%, respectively. We have to note that even when an excess of 8 was added during the condensation reactions, mono-substituted squaraines were obtained as the major products (Chart S1, ESI†), which, however, can continue reacting with 8 through the second-step condensation after simple column purification.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes of DSQ1–3. 
When preparing DSQ3, we attempted to modify the synthetic route of the dimeric end-groups considering the complexity of preparing 3,5-dimethoxy-N-phenylaniline (3, Scheme S1, ESI†). As shown in Scheme S2 (ESI†), a more straightforward one-pot approach was designed for compound 12 with 2-ethylhexyl substituents on the 9-position of the fluorene core, based on a palladium-catalyzed Buchwald–Hartwig coupling reaction, as reported.52 Unfortunately, this one-pot approach only allowed the first-step coupling reaction, and the major product of 11 (Scheme 1b) was obtained with a moderate yield of 61%. With 11 in hand, an additional copper-catalyzed Ullmann coupling with iodobenzene was needed to generate compound 12, followed by a deprotection reaction to afford new dimeric end group 13. Finally, the target dimer DSQ3 was synthesized in a moderate yield of 41% using a similar procedure to that for DSQ1–2. It is worth noting that although this one-pot approach failed, we still preferred to use it in the subsequent syntheses as it provides more opportunity for synthetic manipulations for modifying the structure by simply using different halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons as the regents during the above Ullmann reaction.
All dimers are soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform and chlorobenzene at room temperature. The structure of all new compounds was well-confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy, and HR-MS (Fig. S6–S21, ESI†). Interestingly, we found some split phenomena of proton signals when comparing the 1H NMR spectra of dimeric end-groups 6 and 13 (Fig. 1). According to an earlier report studying a similar skeleton,53 such split phenomena in the spectrum of 13 may be explained by the presence of different structure conformations due to the steric hindrance from the branched 2-ethylhexyl chains and the bulky diphenylamine substitutions on the 2,7-positions of fluorene. Such a special steric effect might create a crowded region, and thus lead to different steric conformations, which, however, could not be assigned as the typical cis- or trans-conformations of squaraines, as reported.54–56 This can be further evidenced by the fact that the aromatic protons adjacent to hydroxyl groups (H1 and H2 in Fig. 1) appeared as multiple resonance peaks at ∼6.0 ppm for compound 13, but a single resonance peak was found for compound 6. Similar phenomena were also observed in the 1H NMR spectra of DSQ1 and 3 (Fig. S1, ESI†). Furthermore, the proton signal of hydroxyl groups in 13 becomes a triplet resonance with a J value of 3.6 Hz, strongly indicating the steric interactions between methylene groups on alkyl chains and hydroxyl groups under this spatial structure environment.

Optical properties
The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of DSQ1–3 in both dichloromethane (DCM) solutions and as thin films are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. All dimers exhibit the absorption characteristics of a typical squaraine in dilute solutions: a relatively sharp absorption band in the visible-NIR region associated with a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of ∼70 nm and large extinction coefficients all exceeding 105 M−1 cm−1 (see Table 1). The varying extinction coefficients of DSQ1–3 with a tendency of DSQ1 > DSQ2 > DSQ3 could be due to the difference in effective dye loading density induced by different lengths of alkyl chains. Similar absorption bands between DSQ1 and 2, located at 688 and 686 nm, respectively, suggest a negligible effect of bridging groups on the effective conjugation length and the electron-donating ability of end-groups possibly due to the particular butterfly-shaped structure. In contrast, the maximum absorption peak of DSQ3 exhibits a blue shift of ∼16 nm compared to that of DSQ1, though they have a similar conjugated structure. This is likely due to the disruption of the planarity of DSQ3 with sterically hindered substituents.56–58

For the thin film spectra (Fig. 2b), the FWHMs of all absorption bands of DSQ1–3 become much larger in comparison with the solution ones (134–165 nm vs. ∼70 nm, Table 1). Such a line-broadening phenomenon thus indicates the existence of aggregation in the solid state, however, at a relatively low level, given their absorption maxima only slightly red-shifted by 9–20 nm when going from solution to film spectra. Moreover, the optical bandgaps (Egs) of DSQ1–3 were calculated based on their long-wavelength absorption edges as 1.60, 1.56 and 1.61 eV, respectively, demonstrating that they have potential as effective low-bandgap donor materials in BHJ-OSCs.
Electrochemical properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode was employed to gather information on their molecular frontier orbital energy levels. As shown in Fig. 2c, DSQ1–3 all show reversible oxidation processes while their reduction processes are irreversible. The oxidation potentials of DSQ1–3 relative to Fc/Fc+ (0.46 V) were determined to be 0.23 V, 0.23 V and 0.25 V, respectively, and thus based on the equation of EHOMO = −(E1/2,ox + 4.8) eV, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels were calculated to be −5.03 eV for DSQ1 and 2, and −5.05 eV for DSQ3, respectively (see Table 1). Similar HOMO levels also suggest a negligible effect of the central bridging groups on the electronic properties of the dimers. Moreover, based on the onset potentials of the reduction peak, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of DSQ1–3 were also calculated to be −3.49 eV, −3.60 eV and −3.57 eV (see Table 1), respectively.
DFT calculations
Density function theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level were performed to study the structural geometry and electronic densities of DSQ1–3, while alkyl chains in the central core of the dimers were truncated to simplify calculations. As shown in Fig. 3, a butterfly-shaped configuration was simulated as the optimized structure, in which two squaraine units locate at the same side relative to the central core. There is no clear difference between their calculated HOMOs and LUMOs, in accordance with the experimental results. Both HOMOs are prevalently distributed on the entire molecular skeleton, while the LUMOs are primarily at the cyclobutadione bridge and partly at the diarylamine groups, meaning the central core has a more significant contribution to the HOMO than to the LUMO. As an example, we also calculated the HOMO−1 and LUMO+1 levels of DSQ2 (Fig. S2, ESI†), and the energy splitting between HOMO and HOMO−1 and LUMO and LUMO+1 was determined to be 0.14 and 0.05 eV, respectively, revealing the existence of weak electronic coupling between two squaraine units.

Thermal stabilities
To evaluate the thermal stability of the dimers, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under a nitrogen atmosphere in the range of 35–500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. As shown in Fig. 2d, all dimers exhibit good thermal stability. From DSQ1 to DSQ2, and to DSQ3, the onset thermal decomposition temperature (Td, corresponding to a 5% weight loss) increases accordingly, while the highest value of Td is observed at 296 °C for DSQ3. One possible reason for the enhanced thermal stability of DSQ3 may be that the presence of steric interactions between branched alkyl chains and hydroxyl groups, as evidenced by the 1H NMR spectrum, makes the structure more stable. Additionally, no clear melting points or glass tansitions were found in the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results in the temperature range of 25 to 250 °C (Fig. S3, ESI†).
Molecular packing properties
As is well known, squaraines often exhibit a strong tendency to aggregate in the solid state, which would provide the possibility of fine tuning their film morphology to improve charge transport ability.48 Nonetheless, a strong self-aggregation of squaraines may cause a serious phase-separation problem when mixing with fullerene acceptors. Here, out-of-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to investigate the molecular packing behaviours of DSQ1–3 in the film state. All the films were deposited on glass substrates via a drop-casting approach. A high film thickness over 1 μm was required to gain a strong enough signal. As shown in Fig. 4, no sharp diffraction peak was observed for all dimers, a clear indication of an amorphous phase. But, it was also found that a relatively blunt diffraction (010) peak appears at around 22.6°. This peak corresponds to a typical but weak π–π stacking with a dπ–π of 3.85 Å, which could be beneficial to hole transport.

Photovoltaic properties
A conventional single-junction device structure of ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/DSQ:PC71BM (40–50 nm)/BCP (4 nm)/Al (100 nm) (Fig. 5a) was fabricated to characterize the photovoltaic performance of these new dimers using [6,6]-phenylC71butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the electron acceptor. The energy level alignments of DSQ1–3 relative to PC71BM are shown in Fig. 5b, from which we can see that they are compatible with each other with a sufficient driving force for exciton dissociation. Note that no solvent additive or thermal annealing treatment was required to process the BHJ layers. More details on the device fabrication and characterization can be found in the Experimental section.

First, we tuned the blending weight ratios of donor/acceptor (D/A) from 1:3 to 1:7 with a total concentration controlled at 25 mg mL−1 to optimize device performance. As shown in Fig. S4 and Table S1 (ESI†), the D/A ratio of 1/5 produced the best performance for all dimers. Upon increasing the acceptor ratio, it was found that the Jsc and FFs of the fabricated devices improved obviously, while the Voc did not show any distinct changes, indicating that the absorption and charge transport properties of the BHJ layers are finely optimized.
The J−V curves of the best-performing devices are illustrated in Fig. 5c, with related device parameters listed in Table 2. DSQ2 with a carbazole core shows the highest PCE of 4.38% among DSQ1–3, with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 10.82 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.49, while that of DSQ1 with a fluorene core is only 2.26%. Considering that DSQ1 and 2 have similar absorption characteristics and energy levels, we assumed that the major reason for inducing such a large difference in device performance may be the side chain effect, which has been proven to play a key role in affecting the molecular packing, crystallinity and thus final device performance.4,9,59 To verify this hypothesis, we then prepared another dimer, DSQ3, based on a modified synthetic route. DSQ3 exhibits a similar π-conjugated structure to DSQ1, but it has branched 2-ethylhexyl chains instead of linear hexyl chains on the 9-position of the fluorene core. As we expected, such side chain modifications finally resulted in a significant improvement in the photovoltaic performance, and the best PCE of DSQ3 was obtained as 4.02%, almost two times that of DSQ1. Our results therefore further strengthen the importance of side chain engineering for squaraine-based donor materials.

As shown in Table 2, a nearly identical Voc is realized among the DSQ1–3 based OSCs and all are over 0.80 V. This can be rationalized by their similar HOMO levels (Table 1). The major contributions to device enhancements for DSQ2 and 3 originate from the changes of Jsc and FF. To elucidate the origin of the enhanced Jsc, the device external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 5d) using the same D/A blending ratio of 1/5 were obtained. As shown, DSQ1–3 all have a wide spectral response in the range of 350–800 nm, however, DSQ2 and 3 exhibit much higher EQE values than DSQ1 from 400 to 750 nm. Besides, DSQ2 also displays a higher EQE value from 650 to 800 nm than DSQ3, consistent with their Jsc values. Considering that they display similar absorption bands while DSQ1 even exhibits the highest extinction coefficient among them, these observations could be due to the difference in the carrier transport and morphology properties of the active BHJ layers.
Thus, the charge transport properties of the BHJ layers with a D/A weight ratio of 1/5 were estimated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†) and Table 2, the hole mobility (μhs) of DSQ1–3 was determined to be 1.92 × 10−5, 1.19 × 10−4 and 1.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher hole mobility exceeding 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for DSQ2 and 3 should be responsible for their larger Jsc and FFs, while the lowest μh of DSQ1 is also in accordance with its smallest Jsc and FF. The introduction of two branched 2-ethylhexyl chains in DSQ3 results in an ∼6 times enhancement in hole mobility compared to DSQ1 with linear side chains, which may be attributed to the optimal BHJ morphology. As confirmed by NMR study, the branched alkyl chains in DSQ3 can induce some configuration changes due to the steric hindrance, which therefore may affect the crystallinity and morphological properties, improving hole mobility. On the other hand, the sterically hindered substituents in DSQ3 could distort its conformation, leading to a slightly lower hole mobility relative to DSQ2, and thus a reduced Jsc.
To study the morphology properties of the BHJ layers caused by structural variations, atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode was then used. As shown in Fig. 6, all three BHJ layers present small domain sizes and a smooth surface with a small root-mean-square (RMS) below 1 nm, owing to the amorphous nature of these dimers as evidenced by XRD results. Nonetheless, DSQ2 and 3-based BHJ layers exhibit smaller RMS values, 0.763 and 0.712 nm, respectively, than that of DSQ1 (0.828 nm), suggesting that an optimal BHJ morphology can be achieved to improve the charge transporting ability of DSQ2 and 3, mainly attributed to their enhanced miscibility with fullerene acceptors.

Conclusions
In conclusion, three new dimeric squaraines (DSQ1–3) were prepared via two synthetic routes by connecting two benzo[e]indole-based asymmetric squaraines with a planar fluorene or carbazole unit. Geometry simulation suggests a butterfly shape for these dimers. Although having different connecting bridge units, DSQ1–3 exhibit similar bandgaps (∼1.6 eV), HOMO levels (∼5.0 eV) and similar molecular packing structures in the solid state. However, there is a remarkable distinction in their charge transport properties in the BHJ films, given that the side chain modifications can lead to an optimal BHJ morphology for charge transport. The hole mobility of DSQ2 and 3 with branched side chains shows one order of magnitude enhancement compared to that of DSQ1 with linear side chains, exceeding 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. As a result, the fabricated DSQ2 and 3 based BHJ-OSCs show much enhanced Jsc and FF values, leading to higher PCEs over 4% compared to that of DSQ1 (2.26%). Our results therefore suggest the importance of subtle side chain modifications for improving the performance of squaraine-based donor materials.
Experimental section
Materials and characterization methods
Most starting materials were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. Toluene was treated with sodium and distilled in the presence of benzophenone. Dichloromethane (DCM) was dried by anhydrous calcium chloride (CaCl2). Compounds 1–3 and 9 were prepared as reported,60–62 and compound 8 was obtained according to our previous work.41
All the compounds were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy on a Bruker Avance III 400 MHz or 600 MHz instrument. High resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) was carried out by using an electron spray ionic (ESI) source. Cyclic voltammetry curves were meaured in a dichloromethane solution of Bu4+NPF6− (0.1 mol L−1) by a CHI 2000 work station in which ferrocene was used as the inner standard and Pt disk, Pt wire, and Ag/Ag+ were used as the work electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra were measured on a SHIMADZU 3600 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed using a Netzsch STA449F3 instrument under a nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Out-of-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the film state was completed on a PANalytical PW3040-60 MRD between 5 and 30° with a scan speed of 0.1° s−1. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used for characterizing the morphology of the blend films using a SHIMADZU SPM-9700.
Device fabrication
Patterned ITO substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath sequentially in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and iso-propanol, following a treatment with plasma for 3 min. The substrates were then transferred into a high vacuum chamber for deposition of 8 nm of MoO3 at a pressure of less than 10−5 Pa with a rate of 5 Å min−1. Then, photoactive layers (thickness: 40–50 nm) were fabricated by spin-coating a blend of DSQ and PC71BM in chlorobenzene with a total concentration of 25 mg mL−1 in a N2-filled glovebox. Note that no solvent additive was added during processing. After that, the fabricated substrates were transferred back to the high vacuum chamber again, where BCP (4 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited as the top electrode at pressures of less than 10−5 Pa with a rate of 4 Å min−1 and 10−5 Pa with a rate of 5 nm min−1, respectively. The final PSCs exhibited a structure of ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/DSQ:PC71BM (40–50 nm)/BCP (4 nm)/Al (100 nm) and the active area of polymer solar cells was 0.06 cm2.
Hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated with the structure ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/DSQ:PC71BM/MoO3 (8 nm)/Al (100 nm) and FTO/TiO2/DSQ:PC71BM/BCP (4 nm)/Al (100 nm), respectively. Mobility was extracted by fitting the current density–voltage curves using space charge limited current (SCLC).
The current–voltage (J–V) curves were measured under 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) simulated sunlight using a Keithley 2400 in conjunction with a Newport solar simulator (94043A). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was calculated from the photocurrent measurement under monochromatic illumination at different wavelengths, using a 150 W xenon lamp and a monochromator.
Synthesis of compound 4
Under a nitrogen atmosphere, to a 100 mL Schlenck bottle was added 1.04 g (2.11 mmol) of 2,7-dibromo-9,9-dihexyl-9H-fluorene (1), 1.00 g (4.36 mmol) of 3,5-dimethoxy-N-phenylaniline (3), 0.16 g (0.18 mmol) of Pd2(dba)3, 0.51 g (5.28 mmol) of t-BuONa, 1.33 mL (0.53 mmol) of t-Bu3P and 30 mL of anhydrous toluene. The mixture was heated to reflux for 24 h. The crude product was extracted with DCM 3 times and then the organic layer was collected and washed with brine, water, and dried over Na2SO4. After concentration using a rotary evaporator, the crude product was purified using column chromatography (silica gel, DCM/hexane, 2/3, v/v) to afford 4 as a light yellow solid (1.61 g, 92%). 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.51 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 2H, ArH), 7.26 (t, J = 7.8 Hz, 4H, ArH), 7.15 (d, J = 7.8 Hz, 4H, ArH), 7.11 (s, 2H, ArH), 7.04–7.02 (m, 4H, ArH), 6.27 (s, 4H, ArH), 6.15 (s, 2H, ArH), 3.70 (s, 12H, –OCH3), 1.81–1.78 (m, 4H, –CH2–), 1.19–1.15 (m, 4H, –CH2–), 1.07–1.04 (m, 8H, –CH2–), 0.82 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 6H, –CH3), 0.71–0.68 (m, 4H, –CH2–).

The solution was then cooled to −78 °C for adding BBr3 (3.00 equivalent) solution in DCM slowly. Afterwards, the mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 2 days, and then quenched with ice water. The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate and the organic layer was collected, washed with water and dried with Na2SO4. After concentration using a rotary evaporator, the crude product was purified using column chromatography (silica gel, ethyl acetate/DCM) to afford compound 6 or 7.

General synthetic procedure of DSQ1 and DSQ2
1.00 equivalent of compound 6 or compound 7 and 2.00 equivalents of semi-squaraine (8) were dissolved in a 1/1 (v/v) mixture of toluene and n-butanol under a nitrogen atmosphere, and then refluxed using a Dean–Stark apparatus overnight. After the solvent was evaporated, the crude product was separated by column chromatography. However, only the mono-substituted squaraine was obtained (Chart S1, ESI†). Then, the mono-substituted product was dissolved in toluene/n-butanol again and reacted with 2.00 equivalents of semi-squaraine (8). The reaction was continued until the mono-substituted squaraine completely disappeared, checked through TLC monitoring. The crude product was purified using column chromatography (silica gel, ethyl acetate/DCM), followed by recrystallization from DCM and methanol to afford pure DSQ1 or DSQ2.
