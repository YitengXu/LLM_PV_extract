, Accepted 9th June 2016First published on 10th June 2016AbstractMetal-free organic dyes comprising donor, electron-conducting, and acceptor moieties with anchoring groups were designed and synthesized for the sensitization of hierarchically structured TiO2 (HS-TiO2) nanoaggregates of TiO2 electrode. The performance of JH-2 in a dye sensitized solar cell (DSSC) was compared with the performances of JH-1 and PTD-02. The DSSC of JH-2 with the HS-TiO2 electrode yielded an unprecedented high photocurrent density of 21.62 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 691 mV and a fill factor of 0.631, and an overall efficiency of 9.42% under standard AM 1.5 sunlight. These were superior to those obtained from the JH-1 DSSC or the PTD-02 sensitizer, which has a chemical structure similar to JH-1, but displayed a much lower photocurrent density and efficiency. The performance of JH-2 DSSC developed here can offer an efficiency comparable to that of a popular ruthenium-coordinated dye (N719) while providing better long-term stability even without a UV filter.
1. Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), fabricated by depositing a wide band gap semiconductor onto a transparent conducting substrate, attaching dye molecules to the semiconductor surface, introducing a redox electrolyte, and depositing a counter-electrode, have attracted a great deal of attention over the past two decades as an economical approach to energy harvesting.1,2 Progress in DSSC development has been quite steady.3,4 The recent appearance of perovskite-based solar cells has presented an interesting alternative to DSSCs: however, DSSCs continue to offer scientific and economic advantages, with much room for improved device performance and a better stability profile compared to the perovskite-based solar cells.5,6 Typical DSSCs use either metal complex sensitizers or metal-free organic donor–acceptor dyes.7–9 The currently top performing state-of-the-art DSSCs are fabricated using porphyrin or ruthenium(II)-polypyridyl sensitizers and yield a power conversion efficiency (η) exceeding 13% or 11% in the presence of an antireflection layer under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation.4,10 Although these metal-complexes represent the most efficient sensitizers known so far, their use in large-scale applications is likely to be limited because of the expensive, and careful, ecologically unfriendly, and tricky preparation steps are required in the synthesis.4,11 Others have investigated the potential utility of metal-free organic dyes, which can be as efficient as metal complexes, but which are advantageous due to their facile design, simple synthesis, high molar extinction coefficients, tunable absorption spectrum, and long-term stability.2,10–14
The design of metal-free dyes requires that the dye molecule structure include an electron donor, a π-conjugated linker, and an electron acceptor (D–π–A) with an attached group for anchoring to the TiO2 anode.2,3 This type of sensitizer exhibits efficient charge migration from the donor to the acceptor through a π-bridge. Because the visible-range molar extinction coefficient of a metal-free dye generally far exceeds that associated with the metal-to-ligand charge transition of ruthenium complexes, the metal-free dyes can facilitate ultrafast interfacial injection from the excited dye molecules to the TiO2 conduction band and slow the rate of recombination between the electrons injected into TiO2 and the oxidized molecules.9,12,13 In our previous study, we applied the sensitizer design to develop a novel D–π–A dye, 3-(5-(5-(5-(4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)-4-hexylthiophene-2-yl)thieno 3,2-b thio phene-2-yl)-3-hexylthiophene-2-yl)-2-cyanoacetic acid (denoted as JH-1) that offered good efficiency and long-term stability profiles.15 Compared to the metal complex (N719)-sensitized DSSC, however, the JH-1 based DSSC provided a lower incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) values in the long wavelength region (>650 nm, low energy region). Others have reported that the attachment of alkoxy groups to the triphenyl amine could enhance photon absorption at long wavelengths due to the destabilization of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO).16
In this study, we designed an efficient metal-free organic dye (3-(5-(5-(5-(4-bis(4-methoxyphenylamino)phenyl)-4-hexylthiophene-2-yl) thieno 3,2-b thiophene-2-yl)-3-hexylthiophene-2-yl)-2-cyanoacetic acid (denoted as JH-2)) with a broader and higher-intensity absorption spectrum at long wavelengths compared to JH-1. The molecular structures of the synthesized organic dyes, JH-2, JH-1, and ((((4-(diphenylamino)phenyl)-thieno 3,2-b thiophene-2-yl)-4-hexylthiophene-2-yl)-3-hexylthiophene-2-yl)-2-cyanoacetic acid (denoted as PTD-02 (ref. 17)) as well as the structure of a ruthenium complex sensitizer, N719, are shown in Fig. 1. The new DSSC based on JH-2 showed good long-term stability and yielded a very high photocurrent density of 21.62 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5G illumination without a reflecting layer. The photovoltaic performance of the new sensitizer in a liquid electrolyte was much better in comparison to the performance of other chemically and structurally similar sensitizers (JH-1, PTD-02) and of a ruthenium complex sensitizer, N719. This comparison provided clues to novel molecular design strategies for efficient metal-free sensitizers and confirmed the importance of the electrode design in high performance DSSCs.

2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis
The synthetic route for JH-1 is outlined in ref. 15 and the details of JH-2 are described here. Scheme 1 shows the synthetic route for JH-2. Like JH-1, JH-2 was synthesized according to the general principle that the triphenyl amine acts as a strong electron donor in a push–pull structure, stabilizing the resonance of the oxidized dyes and promoting rapid dye regeneration due to the molecule's spatial configuration.18–20 Tetrahydrofuran and toluene were used as a solvent after drying over calcium hydride followed by distillation. All other reagents were purchased from Aldrich and used without further purification. All reactions were carried out under an argon atmosphere. Thieno 3,2-b thiophene (1) and tributyl(4-hexylthiophene-2-yl)stannane (3) were synthesized according to established methods.15 4-(Diphenylamino) phenylboronic acid was purchased from Aldrich. Syntheses of 2,5-dibromothieno 3,2-b thiophene (2), 2,5-bis(4-hexylthiophene-2-yl)thieno 3,2-b thiophene (4), and 2-(5-bromo-4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-5-(4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)thieno 3,2-b thiophene (5) were also described in ref. 15. 1H and 13C NMR spectra of compounds (7), (8), and (9) are appended in ESI 1.†

2.2. Device fabrication
The photoanodes composed of hierarchically structured TiO2 (HS-TiO2) nanospheres and nanocrystalline TiO2 particles (nc-TiO2, P25 powder from Degussa) were prepared using the same electro-spraying method.15,18 Photoanodes coated with HS-TiO2 spheres and nc-TiO2 particles were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min under ambient conditions. The (HS- or nc-) TiO2 films were post-treated by soaking for 20 min in 0.1 M TiCl4 aqueous solution at 80 °C. Later, they were rinsed with water and then sintered again at 450 °C for 30 min. The TiCl4-treated photoelectrodes were immersed in a JH-1 or JH-2 solution (both 0.3 mM in ethanol containing 1.5 mM DCA (deoxycholic acid; a co-adsorbent)) or an N719 (Solaronix) solution (0.3 mM in a mixed acetonitrile/tert-butanol solution (5:5, v/v)), and kept at room temperature for 4 h. We prepared the counter electrodes using drop casting 5 mM H2PtCl6 in isopropyl alcohol onto the washed fluoro tin oxide (FTO) plates, followed by sintering it at 500 °C for 30 min. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrodes were rinsed with ethanol and dried under N2 flow. Both electrodes (dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode and Pt counter electrode) were assembled into a sealed sandwich-type cell. Surlyn (Du Pont 1702, 25 μm-thick) film was used as a thermal adhesive film (a spacer) between the electrodes. An electrolyte solution of 0.65 mM 1-butyl-3-methylimmidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.1 M LiI, 0.03 M iodine (I2), and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85/15, v/v) was prepared for the redox couple. This electrolyte solution was introduced into the cell assembly through a hole drilled in the counter electrode. Finally, the holes were sealed with a hot-melt film and a cover glass. Particle size distribution and pore size distribution in HS-TiO2 electrode were fully described in ref. 15 and 18.
2.3. Experimental measurements
2.3.1 UV-vis and cyclic voltammetry. The absorption spectra were obtained using a diode array spectrophotometer (Hewlett-Packard model HP 8453). The absorption spectra of the dyes adsorbed onto TiO2 were measured using HS-TiO2 films. Each HS-TiO2 thin film for the UV-vis spectra measurements was obtained by electrospraying the solution containing nc-TiO2 particles onto a FTO glass substrate, which was then sintered at 500 °C for 30 min.18 After cooling to 80 °C, the transparent TiO2 electrodes were immersed in 0.3 mM N719 (Solaronix) in tert-butanol/acetonitrile (5:5, v/v) or 0.3 mM solution of JH-1 or JH-2 in ethanol with 1.5 mM DCA for 12 h. Cyclic voltammetry (Fig. SI 2†) was performed using a Princeton Applied Research Potentiostat/Galvanostat (Model 273A) in a three-electrode cell assembly consisting of a glassy-carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and an Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode. The measurements were carried out in a JH-2/CH2Cl2 solution (1 mM) with 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as the supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1.
2.3.2 Photovoltaic measurements. The IPCEs were measured as functions of the wavelength from 350 to 800 nm using a specially designed IPCE system for DSSCs (PV Measurement, Inc.). A 75 W Xe lamp was used as the light source for generating a monochromatic beam. Calibration was performed using a NIST-calibrated Si photodiode as the standard. The IPCE values were collected at a low chopping speed of 4 Hz. Stability measurements were performed in a simulator at 60 °C under illumination of 100 mW cm−2. A halogen lamp was used as the light source for the stability test. The temperature was controlled using a thermocouple and cooling fan in an adiabatic chamber. The photovoltaic measurements of the DSSCs employed an AM 1.5 solar simulator with a 450 W Xe lamp. The intensity of the simulated light was calibrated using a Si reference solar cell equipped with a BK7 filter. The photovoltaic characteristics of the DSSCs were obtained by applying an external potential bias to the cells and measuring the generated photocurrent using a Keithley Model 2400 Source Meter.
2.3.3 Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS). The electron transport time and electron recombination lifetime were measured by intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS). IMPS measurements were performed by connecting the solar cell via a potentiostat amplifier (EG&G PAR 273) to the frequency response analyzer. As the light source, a diode laser with variable power and modulation control (Coherent Lab, 40 mW, 446 nm) was used. The light intensity was measured using a calibrated Si photodiode. IMVS was performed under open-circuit conditions. The output of the solar cell was connected directly to a frequency response analyzer (Schlumberger-Solartron SI 1260). During the IMPS and IMVS measurements, the cell was illuminated on the working electrode side with sinusoidally modulated light having a small AC component (10% or less of the DC component).
3. Results and discussion
As we mentioned in the experiments, the π-conjugated linker was composed of two 3-hexyl thiophenes and a planar thienothiophene ring that increased the conjugation length, broadened the absorption spectrum, and increased the molar extinction coefficient.15–20 The long alkyl chains (hexyl groups) on the thiophene rings prevented dye aggregation or charge recombination among the injected electrons.13,15,21 The JH-2 structure differed from JH-1 only in the presence of two methoxy units on the triphenyl amine unit. PTD-02 was structurally identical to JH-1 except for the ordering of the π-conjugated linkers (Scheme 1). The synthesis schemes for JH-1 and PTD-02 have been described elsewhere.15,17
Fig. 2(a) shows the absorption spectra of JH-1, JH-2 and N719 in ethanol. The absorption spectra of JH-1 included strong peaks at 450 nm (with a molar extinction coefficient, of ε = 50000 M−1 cm−1) due to the π–π* transitions within the conjugated molecule while that of JH-2 appeared at 461 nm (ε = 50400 M−1 cm−1). As expected, the absorption maximum of the methoxy group containing JH-2 was red-shifted compared to JH-1, in agreement with results reported previously.16 The molar extinction coefficients (ε) of JH-1 and JH-2 were nearly three times the value of N719 (ε = 15000 M−1 cm−1 at 550 nm). The absorption spectra of PTD-02 showed an absorption peak at 460 nm in tetrahydrofuran (THF).17 The molar extinction coefficient of PTD-02 was quite high (ε = 65000 M−1 cm−1 at 460 nm, see Fig. 3 in ref. 17); however, this value was measured in THF, and a direct comparison could not be made. The high molar extinction coefficients of metal-free sensitizers enabled the use of thinner nanocrystallite TiO2 layers in the electrode, thereby facilitating charge collection while maintaining the light-harvesting capabilities and high photocurrent generation of the DSSCs.18,19 The dark current could be reduced by decreasing the film thickness which augmented the open-circuit photovoltage of the cell.15 They were highly efficient in absorbing photons, but the absorbed photons must be readily converted into free electrons in the TiO2 to produce a high current.

The electrochemical properties of JH-1, JH-2, PTD-02, and N719 are summarized in Table 1. As with JH-1, the electron-rich triphenyl amine moieties in JH-2 and PTD-02 lifted the HOMO level whereas the π-linker groups (thienothiophene and thiophene units) conjugated to the acceptor unit (cyanoacrylic acid) adjusted the LUMO level to a suitable value. The HOMO levels of JH-1, JH-2 and PTD-02 were −5.54 eV, −5.45 eV, and −5.44 eV, respectively. These levels were sufficiently more negative than the iodine/tri-iodide redox potential (−4.9 eV, corresponding to 0.44 eV vs. NHE (the normal hydrogen electrode)18) that rapid dye regeneration occurred, thereby limiting charge recombination between the oxidized dye molecules and the electrons photoinjected into the titania film. It should be noted that the HOMO level of the JH-2 sensitizer shifted positively by ∼0.1 eV due to the destabilization of the HOMO as a result of methoxy substitution. The LUMO levels of the JH-1, JH-2 and PTD-02 (−3.21 eV, −3.20 eV and −2.9 eV) were more positive than the conduction band energy level of TiO2 (−4.01 eV), thereby facilitating efficient charge injection from the excited state dye to the conduction band of TiO2 and regeneration of the oxidized dye. The HOMO and LUMO levels of PTD-02 were almost the same as and more positive than those of JH-1, indicating that PTD-02 had a wider HOMO–LUMO energy gap than JH-1, despite having the same chemical structures. The density functional theory calculations of Li et al. predicted that the HOMO was delocalized over the π-system with the highest electron density centered on the central nitrogen atom of the triphenyl amine unit.22 The LUMO, on the other hand, was localized in the anchoring group through the π-bridge. The cyanoacrylic group was essentially coplanar with the thiophene or thienothiophene π-bridge groups, although PTD-02 underwent large inflexions between the thienothiophene unit and the hexylthiophene unit whereas JH-1 and JH-2 were relatively flat across the π-bridge groups (hexylthiophene–thienothiophene–hexylthiophene) (see Fig. SI 3† for the molecular configurations). Li et al. also explained that if the HOMO–LUMO excitation induced by light irradiation were to shift the electron distribution from the whole molecule to the anchoring moieties, hence, the position of the LUMO near the anchoring moiety would enhance orbital overlap with the titanium 3d orbital to favor electron injection from the dye to TIO2. The planarity in the π-bridge groups in JH-1 and JH-2 allowed the electrons to flow easily from the donor moiety to the acceptor moiety, whereas the electron flow within PTD-02 was not smooth due to the high torsion between the thienothiophene and hexylthiophene groups. Thus, a DSSC based on PTD-02 may provide a higher open circuit voltage (Voc) but a lower photo current density (Jsc) than a DSSC based on JH-1 or JH-2, which was in agreement with the experimental results presented in Table 2 later.

A hierarchically structured-TiO2 (HS-TiO2) electrode prepared using an electrospray method includes fewer grain boundaries compared to hollow spheres, and the polydisperse aggregates in the film increase irregularities resulting in light scattering over a broad spectral range (see Fig. SI 4† for the Scanning Electron Microscopy images of the HS- and nc-TiO2 photoelectrodes).15 We used the same HS-TiO2 electrode preparation process to measure each cell's performance.18 Fig. 2(b) shows the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of JH-1, JH-2 and N719 measured using the HS-TiO2 electrode. The IPCE spectra of the JH-1 and JH-2 sensitizers measured under a white bias light and in the AC mode with a frequency of 4 Hz showed high quantum yield across the visible range of 400–600 nm due to the high extinction coefficients of JH-1 and JH-2.24,25 This quantum yield exceeded that offered by the N719 sensitizer (Fig. 2(a)). The high quantum yield of JH-1 and JH-2 sensitizers resulted from the long conjugation length and molecular planarity arising from the hexylthiophene and thienothiophene rings in π-conjugation linker.21 Interestingly, the quantum efficiency of the JH-2 sensitizer, which included additional methoxy substitutions, was red-shifted compared to the quantum efficiency of the JH-1 sensitizer. This result is attributed to lower energy-gap in the JH-2 sensitizer, in agreement with the UV/vis absorption spectra, as mentioned above.16 The IPCE of PTD-02 was similar to that measured from JH-1 on the nc-TiO2 electrode, although the maximum IPCE (65% at 460 nm) was lower than that of JH-1 (74.8% at 460 nm) on the nc-TiO2 electrode due to the afore-mentioned reasons. The JH-2 based solar cell provided a higher absorbance across the long wavelength region and generated an even higher photocurrent density compared to the JH-1 based solar cell (Fig. 2(c) and Table 2). A significant part of the incident radiation in the long wavelength penetrates the electrode layer, which induces multiple reflections of the light in HS-TiO2 electrodes (see Fig. SI 5† for the schematics of the resonant light scattering and the size effect of the photoelectrodes). The high absorbance resulted from the resonant multiple scattering within the HS-TiO2 electrodes, which trapped long wavelength photons within the structure and increased the opportunities for light absorption.15 Because of the methoxy groups on the tri-phenyl moiety, JH-2 based DSSC provided even higher photocurrent density than the JH-1 based solar cell.16
The measured open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), fill factor (ff), and solar-to-electric conversion efficiency (η) of the solar cells on nc-TiO2 and HS-TiO2 electrodes are listed in Table 2. The PTD-02 sensitizer in the nc-TiO2 electrode DSSC provided a much smaller Jsc but larger Voc compared to JH-1 due to the HOMO–LUMO energy gap and the arrangement of the π-conjugate groups, as discussed above. The solar-to-electric conversion efficiency (η) of PTD-02 was smaller than the efficiencies of either JH-1 or JH-2 in the presence of nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode. The Jsc and Voc values obtained from the JH-2 DSSC were slightly larger than those obtained from the JH-1 DSSC due to the increased IPCE at longer wavelengths as well as the larger energy gap. The N719 DSSC showed a slightly larger Jsc compared to the JH-1 or JH-2 DSSCs prepared with the nanocrystalline (nc)-TiO2 electrode due to the higher IPCE values of the N719 sensitizer DSSC at wavelengths longer than 600 nm.
All HS TiO2 electrode DSSCs, based on JH-1, JH-2 and N719 displayed a noticeable increase in Jsc compared to the nc-TiO2 electrode DSSCs. In Table 2, all masked samples show good agreement with those calculated values within experimental error range. As discussed in our previous study, this increase was attributed to the photon scattering effects of the HS TiO2 particles which scattered photons due to size polydispersity.15,18 The light scattering increased the photon pass length, thereby increasing the absorption by the sensitizers. The JH-2 based DSSCs displayed the most dramatic increase in Jsc due to both the higher absorption coefficient and the resonant photon scattering across longer wavelengths compared to the JH-1 based DSSC. The presence of the additional methoxy groups in JH-2 red-shifted the quantum efficiency relative to the JH-1 sensitizer, which increased Jsc but did not decrease the Voc! To our knowledge, the Jsc measured from the JH-2 DSSC (21.62 mA cm−2) represents the highest short-circuit photocurrent density yet measured among DSSCs. Although the N719 sensitizer displayed a higher IPCE at long wavelengths (>700 nm), the resonant light scattering in the HS-TiO2 electrode of the N719 based cell was not as great as that observed in the JH-1 or JH-2 based DSSCs because the light energy at long wavelengths is weak and the absorption coefficient of N719 sensitizer was low. The cell efficiencies (η) were 9.18%, for the JH-1-, 9.42% for the JH-2-, and 9.77% for the N719-based DSSC. The increase in Jsc due to the addition of the methoxy group without decreasing Voc increased the overall DSSC efficiency.
Intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) were used to gain insight into the charge transport characteristics of the TiO2 layer and charge recombination in the DSSC's titania/electrolyte interface. Fig. 3 shows plots of the recombination lifetimes and electron diffusion coefficients as a function of the incident photon flux (light intensity). For a given TiO2 electrode 11 μm thick, recombination was fastest in the JH-1 cell. The JH-2 cell recombination time was twice that of the JH-1 cell, whereas the N719 cell recombination time was 7 to 10 times longer than that of the JH-1 cell, indicating that the back-reaction rate in the JH-2 cell was slower than in the JH-1 cell but faster than in the N719 cell. Hence, the charge collection efficiency in the N719 cell was highest, followed by the JH-2 cell, and the charge collection in the JH-1 was the lowest. The shorter recombination lifetime in the JH-1 cell would be expected to reduce the Voc in the JH-1 sensitized photoelectrode, whereas longer lifetime in the JH-2 cell could compensate this. The measured recombination lifetimes agreed well with the Voc values reported in Table 2. The electron diffusion coefficients (D) and recombination lifetimes (τ) were used to calculate the relative electron diffusion lengths, Ln, of the DSSCs defined as the average distance through which an injected electron travels through the conduction band of TiO2 prior to recombination according to the equation, Ln ≈ (Dτ)1/2.14 The long electron diffusion length (Ln) in the JH-2-based device (∼15.80 μm) compared to Ln in the JH-1-based device (∼11.18 μm) indicates that an electron injected into the JH-2 sensitized photoelectrode travelled a much longer distance than an electron injected into the JH-1 sensitized photoelectrode. The long electron diffusion length due to the slow recombination reaction increased the photocurrent density (increased charge collection efficiency) relative to the JH-1-based DSSC. The high photocurrent density of the JH-2-based DSSC prepared with HS-TiO2 electrode could be plausibly explained as resulting from the long recombination lifetime and, hence, the long electron diffusion length due to the presence of methoxy groups on the phenyl units in JH-2. These groups broadened the absorption spectrum (Fig. 2(a)) and increased the molar extinction coefficient.16 The enhanced IPCE at longer wavelengths further increased photon absorption by multiplying the resonant light scattering within the HS-TiO2 electrode. The conversion efficiency of the JH-2 dye (9.42%) prepared with an HS-TiO2 electrode without an antireflective layer is quite promising for the development of DSSCs based on a metal-free organic dye. Under the same conditions, the N719-based solar cell yielded a conversion efficiency of 9.77%. Thus we confirm that the harmonization of the resonant multiple scattering induced by controlling the size of TiO2 aggregates and the absorption spectrum of the dye obtained from tuning up the π-bridge groups arrangement provides a very effective approach to achieving a high photocurrent density and energy conversion efficiency.
Practical large-scale photovoltaic applications require good long-term stability in addition to a good photon conversion efficiency. The stability properties of the newly developed DSSCs were tested by submitting our cells to 800 h of accelerated testing conditions at 60 °C in a solar simulator with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and without a UV absorbing filter. The JH-2 DSSC exhibited very good properties over 800 hours, with weak attenuation of the device performance upon further illumination (Fig. 4) due to the loss of the sensitizer and/or penetration of I3− into the TiO2 surface.26

The added methoxy groups did not deteriorate the long term stability. Water molecules were effectively prevented from approaching the TiO2 surface by the hydrophobic alkyl chains in the JH-1 and JH-2 sensitizers, thereby preventing dissolution of sensitizers into the electrolyte. After 800 h, the DSSC prepared with the JH-2 sensitizer exhibited an efficiency of 7.82% (83% of its initial efficiency) exceeding the efficiency of the JH-1-based solar cell (7.44%, 81% of its initial efficiency). By contrast, the DSSC prepared with the N719 dye exhibited an efficiency of 5.27% (54% of its initial efficiency). These results are quite encouraging promise for practical applications of DSSC using a metal-free sensitizer.
4. Conclusions
We have set a new benchmark for DSSC performances by fabricating a very efficient device that yields a high photocurrent and good stability. The new sensitizer (JH-2)-based cell generated the highest photocurrent density reported thus far. That benchmark was accomplished by harmonizing the absorption spectrum of the dye (wider than that of JH-1 based solar cell) with the average size of the aggregates in the TiO2 electrode. The power conversion efficiency was shown to be sensitive to the structural modifications, i.e., the introduction of methoxy groups into the diphenyl amino unit of the JH-2 sensitizer and the arrangement of π-conjugated bridges (hexylthiophene–thienothiophene–hexylthiophene groups) for the coplanarization. The chemical structures of the organic sensitizer should be optimized to enhance the light harvesting properties through the formation of a more planar π-conjugation system, broadening the absorption spectrum and stronger donor and acceptor moieties. The resonant multiple scattering was also an important factor to enhance the light harvesting efficiency and charge collection yield. The high and robust photovoltaic performance of the JH-2 DSSC prepared without an antireflecting layer (with an initial efficiency of 9.42% and an efficiency of 7.82% after 800 h irradiation at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 without a UV filter) demonstrates the promise of this novel sensitizer for large-scale applications.
