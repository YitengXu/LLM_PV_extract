    , Accepted 17th February 2017First published on 17th February 2017AbstractPerovskite solar cells continue to attract strong attention because of their unprecedented rate of power conversion efficiency increase. CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) is the most widely studied perovskite. Typically one-step (1-s) or two-step (2-s) deposition methods are used to prepare MAPbI3 films. Here, we investigate a new MAPbI3 film formation method that combines 1-s and 2-s deposition (termed 1 & 2-s) and uses systematic variation of the stoichiometric mole ratio (x) for the PbI2 + xMAI solutions employed. The PbI2 + xMAI solutions were used to deposit precursor films that were subsequently dipped in MAI solution as a second step to produce the final MAPbI3 films. The morphologies of the 1 & 2-s MAPbI3 films consisted of three crystal types: tree-like microcrystals (≫1 μm), cuboid meso-crystals (∼0.1–1 μm) and nanocrystals (∼50–80 nm). Each crystal type and their proportions were controlled by the value for x. The new 1 & 2-s deposition method produced MAPbI3 films with tuneable optoelectronic properties that were related to those for the conventional 1-s and 2-s films. However, the 1 & 2-s film properties were not simply a combination of those for the 1-s and 2-s films. The 1 & 2-s films showed enhanced light scattering and the photoluminescence spectra displayed a morphologically-dependent red-shift. The unique morphologies for the 1 & 2-s films also strongly influenced PbI2 conversion, power conversion efficiency, hysteresis and recombination. The trends for the performance parameters and hysteresis were compared for devices constructed using spiro-MeOTAD and P3HT and were similar. The 1 & 2-s method should apply to other perovskite formulations and the new insights concerning MAPbI3 crystal growth conditions, morphology and material properties established in this study should also be transferable.
Introduction
The interest in perovskite solar cells has dramatically accelerated in recent years1,2 which is driven in large part by the remarkable increase of their power conversion efficiency. A certified value of 22.1% has recently been achieved.3 Whilst there are many challenges to overcome,4 excellent progress continues to be made5–7 and there is good reason to believe that these new solar cells may one day contribute to low carbon electricity generation.8 Here, a new (combined) method is investigated for the preparation of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite films. The latter is the most commonly studied perovskite.9 There are two main deposition methods used to prepare MAPbI3 photoactive layers. The 1-step deposition (abbreviated as 1-s) method uses a solution containing a (normally) stoichiometric ratio of PbI2 and MAI.10 Alternatively, the 2-step deposition (2-s) method involves the sequential deposition of PbI2 onto a mesoporous TiO2-coated substrate (mp-TiO2) followed by dipping into a MAI solution.11 The latter approach may also involve anti-solvent additives to control crystallisation.12 The morphologies of MAPbI3 prepared by the 1-s and 2-s methods can differ greatly. The 1-s and 2-s preparation methods have been reported to produce tree-like and cuboid MAPbI3 crystal morphologies, respectively.13,14 The ability to tune the morphology of perovskites is important both for improving the fundamental understanding of the relationship between morphology and optoelectronic properties as well as for the practical optimisation of solar cell performance.15 In the present fundamental study we investigate a new approach for MAPbI3 preparation that combines the 1-s and 2-s methods (abbreviated as 1 & 2-s) and uses reaction stoichiometry control. The aims of the study were to (1) investigate whether such films had morphologies and optoelectronic properties that were combinations of those for films prepared by the conventional 1-s and 2-s routes and (2) broaden the understanding of the relationships between formulation conditions and properties.
Whilst the 1-s method has been successfully used to prepare perovskite films16–18 and is known to provide stoichiometric MAPbI3 compositions, uncontrolled crystallisation may result in films with low surface coverage. Generally, the 2-s method provides fewer pinholes and higher efficiencies for devices.14,19 However, the 2-s method is susceptible to incomplete conversion of PbI2.20 Remnant PbI2 results in decreased light absorption and photocurrent. On the other hand remnant PbI2 can reduce recombination21 and even increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE).22 Here, we investigate films prepared using our new 1 & 2-s method and also the effect of preparation conditions on PbI2 conversion. The film deposition sequence (Scheme 1a) involved reaction of PbI2 + xMAI solutions as the first step, where x is the stoichiometric ratio of MAI used. The x values of 0 and 1.0, respectively, correspond to 2-s (Scheme 1b) and 1-s (Scheme 1d). The x values of 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66 correspond to 1 & 2-s (Scheme 1c). The proportions of MAPbI3 prepared in the first and second steps of the 1 & 2-s process were tuned using x. As x increased a higher proportion of the total MAPbI3 was formed during the first step (in precursor films) and less additional MAPbI3 was formed during the second step which produced the final films.

The other rows depict (b) 2-step deposition (2-s), (c) combined 1 and 2-step deposition (1 & 2-s) and (d) 1-step deposition (1-s) methods. The middle and right hand columns show photographs of precursor and final films, respectively. For (d), which had x = 1.0, there was only a final film. The dimensions of the films were ∼2.0 cm × 1.5 cm. 
There have been relatively few MAPbI3 studies where reaction stoichiometries of the precursor solutions have been investigated. Zhang et al. prepared planar MAPbI3 films by mixing PbI2 and MAI solutions at specific mole ratios of MAI and then deposited those films before dipping the films into MAI solution.23 That work differed from the present study because they used lower x values than used here, did not use a mesoporous TiO2 coated substrate and did not form a perovskite prior to dipping in the MAI solution. By contrast our approach involved formation of an initial (precursor) perovskite film with excess PbI2 before a MAI dipping step (Scheme 1c). Roldán-Carmona et al.22 used a 1-s method and non-stoichiometric ratios of PbI2 to MAI combined with an anti-solvent to obtain high efficiency devices. However, they used relatively low x values compared to those used here and did not dip their films into a MAI solution as a second step.
In the present study stoichiometry variation during the formation of precursor films was employed as a form of intermediate engineering to control the morphology of the final MAPbI3 films. Other approaches to control MAPbI3 morphology have used solvents such as DMSO, which is a high boiling point and strongly coordinating solvent, to form intermediate complexes that decreased the rate of MAPbI3 crystallisation. DMSO delays MAPbI3 crystallisation because of the formation of strong PbI2(DMSO) adducts.24–26 In contrast, DMF forms weaker adducts with Pb, i.e., PbI2(DMF), and the replacement of DMF with MAI results in MAPbI3 formation.27 Here, we used DMF as the solvent to encourage rapid crystallisation of the MAPbI3 phases and enable morphological differences due to reaction stoichiometry to be clearly revealed.
In this study we introduce and investigate a new and versatile combined deposition approach that provides widely tunable MAPbI3 morphologies. The study focusses on understanding the relationships between the film morphology and optoelectronic properties. The morphology of MAPbI3 films is investigated using optical microscopy and SEM. The spectroscopic properties are studied using UV-visible, photoluminescence (PL) and transient absorption spectroscopies. Because this study focussed on establishing relationships between crystal growth and properties it did not aim to obtain high performance devices. Nevertheless, the effect of preparation conditions on device performance is investigated. The 1 & 2-s method had a major effect on nucleation and growth and generally provided systematic control over film morphology, optoelectronic properties and device performance. We show that the distinct morphology that resulted from the 1 & 2-s approach was not simply a combination of those from the 1-s and 2-s methods and resulted in important differences in the physical chemistry underpinning the MAPbI3 films. Our new and simple combined approach to MAPbI3 film preparation should apply to other perovskites and is expected to provide enhanced versatility for morphological and property control.
Experimental
Materials
Isopropanol (IPA, anhydrous, 99.5%), methylamine (≥98%), HI (99.95%, 57 wt% solution in water), 4-tert-butylpyridine (96%), lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonimidate (LiTFSI, 99.95%), PbI2 (99.999%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous, 99.8%), and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT, Mn 54000–75000), titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TDB, 75 wt% in IPA) were all purchased from Aldrich and used as received. Dyesol 18NRT titania paste (TiO2) and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD, Fenglin Chemicals, 99.5%) were also used as received.
Perovskite film preparation
MAI was synthesized according to the method reported elsewhere.28 This involved the dropwise addition of 30 mL of aqueous HI solution (57 wt%) to 27.9 mL of an aqueous solution of methylamine (40 wt%) in an ice bath with stirring. The cold solution was stirred for 2 h, and the solvent was evaporated using a rotary evaporator. The crystals were washed using diethyl ether three times and dried in a vacuum oven. ITO/glass slides (2.0 cm × 1.5 cm) were cleaned by sonication in a 1% Hellmanex solution in boiling water for 15 min followed by rinsing with water and IPA and cleaning in ultrasonic for 5 min and dried using a nitrogen stream. Titania paste (70 μL, 1:5 in ethanol) was spin-coated onto the cleaned glass slides at 5000 rpm for 30 s to form a mesoporous scaffold (mp-TiO2) with an average thickness of 250 nm. The films were then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. Next, solutions of PbI2 + xMAI in DMF containing PbI2 (1.0 M) and x = 0, 0.33, 0.50, 0.66, 1.00 M of MAI were prepared in a glove box (humidity ∼2%). Film fabrication was subsequently conducted outside of the glove box (humidity ∼40%). The solutions were spin-coated onto the mp-TiO2 layer (Scheme 1). Note that x = 0 and 1.0 correspond to the 2-s and 1-s methods, respectively. The values x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66 correspond to 1 & 2-s films. The solutions were kept at 70 °C during spin-coating. The spin-coating conditions employed were 2000 rpm for 40 s for the 1-s and 1 & 2-s methods; whereas, 6500 rpm for 60 s was used for the 2-s method. The films were dried at 100 °C for 15 min (or 30 min for 1-s, x = 1.0). The dried films (with the exception of the 1-s film) were washed with IPA for 3 s and then dipped in 20 mL MAI (10 mg mL−1) for 15 min. The films were dried at 100 °C for 15 min and immediately placed in a desiccator over P2O5 and stored in the dark until investigation. The 1s and 1 & 2-s film layer thicknesses were in the range 550–700 nm. The thickness for the x = 0 film was 350 nm.
Device fabrication
Laser-patterned, ITO-coated glass substrates (20 Ω sq−1) were cleaned by ultrasonication in a 2% Hellmanex solution, rinsed with deionized water and IPA, and dried. A blocking layer of compact TiO2 (bl-TiO2) was then deposited by spin coating TDB (75 μL, 0.15 M) solution in 1-butanol at 2000 rpm for 60 s. The procedure was repeated using a TDB solution (0.30 M) and the substrate was heated at 125 °C for 5 min to give an average thickness of 50 nm. A mp-TiO2 layer was then deposited as described above. Perovskite photoactive layers were then deposited as described above. P3HT was deposited as a hole transport matrix (HTM). The latter (average thickness of 100 nm) was deposited by dynamic spincoating of P3HT in toluene (15 mg mL−1) at 4000 rpm for 20 s. Following Heo et al., Li-TFSI salt and t-BP in acetonitrile were added to the P3HT solution.28 Finally, a gold layer (70 nm) was deposited on top of the HTM. The fabrication procedures were performed outside the glovebox in ∼40% relative humidity. Devices were also prepared using spiro-MeOTAD as the HTM with an average thickness of 100 nm. In that case HTM deposition followed established literature procedures.29,30 All devices were stored in a desiccator over P2O5 in the dark until investigation.
Physical measurements
The surface morphologies were investigated using a Philips XL30 FEI-SEM. The device cross section was prepared with Ar ion polishing at 6 kV and cleaned at 1 kV using Ilion system from Gatan (France). The cross-section microstructure was investigated using a FEI Magellan FEG-SEM and the local composition probed via energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). XRD data were obtained using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (Cu-Kα). The films obtained were scanned between 10 and 50° with a step size of 0.02. For these measurements the films were prepared and measured under a nitrogen atmosphere. UV-visible spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 25 spectrometer. Optical images were obtained using an Olympus BX41 polarizing microscope with an Olympus U-AN360-3 rotatable analyser and polariser filter. PL spectra were obtained using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS980 spectrometer. Pump–probe microsecond to millisecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) measurements were conducted on mp-TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-MeOTAD films excited by a dye laser (Photon Technology International GL-301, sub-nanosecond pulse width) pumped by a pulsed nitrogen laser (Photon Technology International GL-3300). A quartz halogen lamp (Bentham IL1) was passed through a monochromator and used to probe changes in the absorption characteristics of the films as a function of time after the laser excitation. The probe light was detected using home-built silicon (≤1000 nm) or InxGa1−xAs (>1000 nm) photodiodes and an oscilloscope. Perovskite films were kept under flowing N2 during the measurements. All TAS measurements employed 567 nm laser pulses (25 μJ cm−2).
Device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2420 Sourcemeter and 100 mW cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5G) and a calibrated NREL certified Oriel Si-reference cell. An Oriel SOL3A solar simulator was used for these experiments. The active area of the devices was defined using a square aperture within a mask and fixed at 0.16 cm2. Forward and reverse direction sweeps were measured with a sweep rate of 100 mV s−1.
Results and discussion
Effects of preparation conditions on MAPbI3 morphology
Three MAPbI3 film types were prepared using our new method that utilised combined 1 & 2-s (x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66) deposition and control of the stoichiometric ratio (x) for the reaction of PbI2 + xMAI (see Scheme 1a and c). The first step involved spin-coating mp-TiO2 using a PbI2 + xMAI solution and drying the film at 100 °C to give a precursor film. The second step involved dipping the precursor film in MAI solution to convert excess PbI2 to the final MAPbI3 film. The 2-s (x = 0) system was prepared as a control (Scheme 1b). The 1-s (x = 1.0) system was another control and was prepared as a final film in one step (Scheme 1d). The precursor films prepared using PbI2 + xMAI solutions with x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66 turned black prior to the final dipping step in MAI solution (films shown in middle column of Scheme 1c). The precursor films appeared more black (and less yellow) as x increased due to decreased PbI2 in the films. After subsequent MAI solution dipping, the final films were dark black (films shown in right hand column of Scheme 1) due to conversion of the excess PbI2 to MAPbI3.
The precursor films and final films were examined using SEM (Fig. 1). The images for the precursor films are shown in Fig. 1a and reveal that dramatic changes in the morphology occurred as x increased. Tree-like micrometer-sized crystals (termed here as microcrystals) appeared and were most pronounced for x = 0.66. Because the microcrystals were absent for the x = 0 precursor film (which was PbI2), they are attributed to MAPbI3. The highest magnification image insets (Fig. 1a, right hand column) show that the surfaces of the microcrystals were covered by smaller crystals which had a comparable appearance to the nanocrystals evident for PbI2 (x = 0) and are proposed to have been excess PbI2. This proposal was supported by EDX data which probed the compositions of the microcrystals for the 1 & 2-s precursor prepared using x = 0.66 (see Fig. S1, ESI†). The data show that the microcrystals (with nanocrystals at the surface) had a relatively high Pb2+ content compared to the theoretical value for x = 0.66 and the background perovskite signal.
 Fig. 1  SEM images showing morphologies of precursor (a) and final (b) MAPbI3 films. The variation of coverage with stoichiometric ratio (x) (Scheme 1) for the precursor and final films is shown in (c) and was determined from the images shown in (a and b), respectively. The scale bars for SEM images on the left and right hand sides of (a and b) are 20 μm and 200 nm, respectively. Note that the precursor film for x = 0 was PbI2. 
To prepare the final films (x < 1.0) the precursor films were dipped in MAI solution and heated (see Scheme 1b and c). This MAI dipping step converted the excess PbI2 to MAPbI3 according to the right hand side of the equation shown in Scheme 1a. (Because there was only a final film produced by the 1-s method (x = 1.0, Scheme 1d) the SEM images for that film are shown in Fig. 1b.) The 1-s (x = 1.0) film consisted of interconnected micrometer-sized tree-like microcrystals. These microcrystals had fewer branches compared to the films prepared using x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66, which implies a decrease in nucleation occurred as x increased. These morphology differences in the films were also apparent using polarised light optical microscopy (Fig. S2, ESI†). Interestingly, the higher magnification SEM images of Fig. 1b showed that cuboid crystals with average sizes in the range of 140–460 nm were present. These crystals became smaller with increasing x (see Fig. S3, ESI†). We term the crystals as meso-crystals because they had dimensions (∼0.1–1 μm) that were between those for the MAPbI3 microcrystals (≫1 μm) present in the capping layer and the smaller nanocrystals (∼50–80 nm) within the mp-TiO2 layer (later). The % coverage by the capping layer was calculated using image analysis from the lower magnification images (Fig. 1a and b). (An example SEM image and a description of the method used to calculate the % coverage values are given in Fig. S4, ESI.†) The variation of % coverage as function of x is shown in Fig. 1c. The % coverage was highest for the precursor 2-s film (x = 0), which was PbI2, and decreased with increasing x. The % coverage for the precursor and final 1 & 2-s films (x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66) were not able to be distinguished because the meso-crystals were about an order of magnitude smaller than microcrystals. Consequently, the meso-crystals were too small to influence the % coverage values which were dominated by the relatively large microcrystals.
As x increased the tree-like microcrystals became longer, tended to interpenetrate less and had fewer branches, which indicates a decrease in the number-density of nucleation sites. This trend is best seen from lower magnification images of Fig. 1a and b. The growth of the cuboid meso-crystals, which occurred during MAI dipping, was likely governed by homogeneous nucleation and growth with a contribution from dissolution and crystallisation.31 As x increased the proportion of unreacted PbI2 decreased. We speculate that the apparent high nucleation density for lower x values was due to a higher extent of supersaturation in the PbI2-rich deposition solutions. The microcrystals of the precursor films were covered by PbI2 nanocrystals (discussed above) which were converted to MAPbI3 upon MAI solution dipping. These features are captured in the mechanism depicted in Fig. 2.

Achieving complete conversion of PbI2 to MAPbI3 can be challenging for films prepared using the conventional 2-s deposition method6,20,21 and PbI2 peaks have been frequently observed in X-ray diffractograms.32,33 We investigated the effect of the MAI dipping time for the final 2-s (x = 0) films using XRD. The conversion was probed using the %amplitude of the MAPbI3(110) peak with respect to the PbI2(001) peak, using (1)where A(110) and A(001) are the amplitudes for the MAPbI3(110) and PbI2(001) peaks, respectively. The %amplitude increased rapidly for dipping times less than 2 min and then increased more slowly for dipping times between 2 and 30 min (Fig. S5, ESI†). A dipping time of 15 min was used in this study because it was in the middle of the region where conversion increased slowly. This value corresponded to %amplitude = 87%. The diffractograms were recorded under a nitrogen atmosphere which rules out post-preparation degradation involving moisture as the origin of PbI2. Consequently, residual PbI2 is attributed to incomplete conversion of PbI2 which was buried within the mp-TiO2 layer.
X-ray diffractograms for all of the final films are shown in Fig. 3a. The (110) peak at 2θ = 14° was dominant for the MAPbI3 films. However, there was also evidence for PbI2 in the diffractograms for the 1 & 2-s (x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66) films at 2θ = 12.8°. By contrast, the 1-s film (x = 1.0) had negligible PbI2. Fig. 3b shows the variation of %amplitude with x for the final films. Interestingly the %amplitude value increased linearly with x for the 1 & 2-s (x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66) and 2-s (x = 1.0) films. The precursor MAPbI3 microcrystals are proposed to have restricted MAI ingress into the mp-TiO2 layer (see below). As x increased the % coverage of the mp-TiO2 surface decreased (Fig. 1c). Also, there was less excess PbI2 in the precursor films as x increased according to Scheme 1a. Both of these effects (decreased coverage and less excess PbI2) were responsible for increased conversion as x increased. However, the %amplitude for the 2-s (x = 0) film did not fit the linear trend established for the other films which might be due to the absence of MAPbI3 at the precursor stage.

(b) Variation of the %amplitude for the films from (a) with x (see text). (c) Average size determined from the Scherrer equation as a function of x. 
To identify the location of the residual PbI2 discussed above a cross-section of an ITO/bl-TiO2/mp-TiO2/MAPbI3/spiro-MeOTAD/Au device containing a final 1 & 2-s (x = 0.5) film was examined using SEM and EDX (see Fig. S6, ESI†). Whilst the atomic% of Pb near the surface was close to the observed in other studies for MAPbI3,34 the data also show that the atomic% of Pb was highest deep within the mp-TiO2 layer. These data indicate that PbI2 was located deep within the mp-TiO2 layer and supports the proposal above of restricted MAI access.
The Scherrer equation was used to calculate the average grain size for the MAPbI3 and PbI2 crystals present (Fig. 3c). Following Jeong et al.25 the full-width at half-maximum heights (FWHM) for the MAPbI3(110), (202) and (220) peaks were used for these calculations. In the case of PbI2 the FWHM for the (001) peak was used. These data and analysis gave average MAPbI3 sizes in the range of 56 to 73 nm. These species originated in large part from MAPbI3 nanocrystals within the mp-TiO2 layer.35,36 Indeed, the MAPbI3 size range is commensurate with the average pore diameter of 64 ± 17 nm obtained from the pore size distribution of mp-TiO2 measured from SEM (Fig. S7, ESI†). The average MAPbI3 size likely increased with increasing x (Fig. 3c) due to an increase in the proportion of MAPbI3 that was present in the capping layer as relatively large microcrystals and/or meso-crystals. Because the microcrystals and meso-crystals had dimensions that were much larger than 100 nm (Fig. S3, ESI† and Fig. 1) it is likely that (smaller) MAPbI3 nanocrystals within the mp-TiO2 were the majority MAPbI3 species present for all of the films. The Scherrer analysis also showed that the average size for the residual PbI2 nanocrystals present was 42–47 nm.
Effects of morphology on the film spectroscopic properties
The UV-visible spectra for the precursor films and final MAPbI3 films were measured and are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The spectra for all of the precursor films (Fig. 4a) contained an absorption maximum (or shoulder) at 520 nm, which was due to PbI2. The latter suggestion is confirmed by the spectrum for the precursor 2-s (x = 0) film which was PbI2. The relative size of the absorption at 520 nm decreased as x increased which is expected because more of the PbI2 was converted to MAPbI3 at the precursor stage. Evidence for MAPbI3 can be seen from the band-edge absorption from MAPbI3 at 775 nm, which was most pronounced for the x = 0.33 film (see inset of Fig. 4a).

Once the precursor films were converted to the final MAPbI3 films several features of the spectra changed considerably (see Fig. 4b). Firstly, for each final 1 & 2-s films the MAPbI3 absorption at 775 nm (inset of Fig. 4b) increased compared to the respective precursor film (inset of Fig. 4a) which is due to greater PbI2 conversion. This absorbance increase was strongest for the x = 0.33 and 0.50 films. Secondly, the spectra for the 1 & 2-s films (x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66) became relatively flat; whereas, the spectra for the 2-s (x = 0) and 1-s (x = 1.0) films had absorbance values that increased strongly with decreasing wavelength. The flat type of spectrum was noted by Jain et al.37 Here, the flat spectrum is due to scattering from microcrystals within the capping layer. Particles that are much larger than the nanometre size range scatter light in a complex manner according to Mie theory.38 The present spectra indicate that the nature of the light interaction with the films was fundamentally changed for the 1 & 2-s films as compared to the 2-s (x = 0) and 1-s (x = 1.0) films.
The extent of light scattering for the 1 & 2-s (x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66) final films was greater than or equal to that for the 2-s (x = 0) and 1-s (x = 1.0) films as judged by the absorbance values at 900 nm (A900, see Fig. 4c). The value for A900 was dominated by Mie scattering39 and light scattering was strongest for the films containing microcrystals (x > 0). Interestingly, there was a linear decrease for A900 with increasing x for both the precursor and final 1 & 2-s films (x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66). This is most likely the result of a decreased coverage by the microcrystals with increasing x (Fig. 1c). Whilst other workers have included scattering particles within perovskite photoactive layers,40 the data shown in Fig. 4c demonstrate that light scattering tuning can be achieved using morphology control of MAPbI3 within the capping layer. Enhanced light scattering within photoactive layers is potentially beneficial for maximising light harvesting within solar cells because it can increase the path length.40–42
The PL spectra of the final MAPbI3 films were measured (Fig. 5a). All of the spectra showed a strong band-edge emission peak at 776 to 784 nm. The signals indicate incomplete non-radiative recombination due to inefficient quenching by the mp-TiO2 scaffold. The PL intensity for the 1 & 2-s films (x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66) decreased with increasing x and was highest for the film prepared using x = 0.33 (see Fig. 5b). The PL intensities for the 1 & 2-s films (x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66) films were significantly higher than those for the 2-s (x = 0) and 1-s (x = 1.0) films. It follows that more of the photogenerated charges within the 1 & 2-s films were greater than a distance corresponding to the exciton diffusion length (∼100 nm43) from the mp-TiO2 surface. The higher PL intensity for those films is due to a combination of increased MAPbI3 in the capping layer (Fig. 1b) and stronger absorption (Fig. 4b).

The position of the wavelength corresponding to the maximum PL intensity (λmax) is plotted as a function of x in Fig. 5c. It can be seen that a red-shift of 8.0 nm occurred as x increased from 0 (2-s) to 1.0 (1-s). Interestingly, after an initial sharp increase of λmax when x increased from 0 to 0.33, the λmax values gradually increased linearly with x. Whilst band gap tuning has been achieved by using anion33 or cation44 substitution in perovskites, the ability to achieve tuning using combined deposition control is new. An expanded view of the maxima (see Fig. S8, ESI†) shows that their positions (and specifically λmax) could be generally approximated using a superposition of the signals due to 2-s (x = 0) and 1-s (x = 1.0) systems (below). Consequently, the PL signals for the 1 & 2-s films originated from combinations of the signals found in the MAPbI3 films prepared using 1-s and 2-s deposition.
In a study of cuboid MAPbI3 crystals deposited using a 2-s method D'Innocenzo et al. showed that increased crystal size caused a λmax red-shift.45 The meso-crystals present for our systems are similar to those for D'Innocenzo et al. However, here the size decreased with increasing x (Fig. S3, ESI†) which rules out the possibility that their size dominated the λmax red shift. PbI2 is known to cause a blue-shift for the PL spectra of MAPbI3 due to passivation.46 The XRD data (Fig. 3a) showed that all of the films with blue-shifted λmax values (x < 1.0) contained residual PbI2. However, the λmax value for the x = 0 film (Fig. 5c) does not agree with this trend because that film had a PbI2 content that was similar to those present in the x = 0.50 and 0.66 films based on the %amplitude values (Fig. 3b) but had the most strongly blue shifted λmax value.
Microcrystals were present for films containing x = 0.33 to 1.0. They were also located on top of the mp-TiO2 layer and fluorescence from those species should have been less quenched. As a first approximation, the PL maxima for the 1 & 2-s (x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66) films could be generally matched using a weighted spectrum for a hypothetical x = 0.75 film calculated using 75% weighting of the measured spectra for the 1-s (x = 1.0) film and a 25% weighting of the 2-s (x = 0) film (see Fig. S8, ESI†). In contrast, the measured spectra for x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66 could not be matched to the respective hypothetical spectra calculated using x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66 (not shown). Moreover, those hypothetical spectra were all significantly blue shifted compared to the respective measured spectra for those films. Therefore, the PL spectra of the 1 & 2-s (x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66) films were not a straightforward linear combination of those for the 1-s and 2-s systems; rather they were preferentially weighted with x = 1.0 species. Hence, the data suggest that the microcrystals were mostly responsible for the PL spectra.
Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) was employed to investigate the effect of x on photo-induced separation. These experiments were conducted using a glass/mp-TiO2/Perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD architecture (Fig. S9, ESI†) and probed the yield of photo-generated [spiro-MeOTAD]+ polarons as a function of time after pulsed laser irradiation (567 nm) by measurement of the change in absorption (ΔOD) at 1600 nm. The decay kinetics data indicate that upon increasing x, and moving from 2-s (x = 0) through 1 & 2-s (x = 0.5) to 1-s (x = 1.0), a shorter charge separation lifetime was observed. For x = 0, the charge recombination was within a timescale of 5–50 μs. In comparison, increasing x accelerated the recombination kinetics, where a significant fraction of the decay appears to have occurred on a timescale faster than instrument response of the transient spectrometer (i.e., <1 μs). The data indicate that the extent of recombination and hence recombination kinetics for the 1 & 2-s film (x = 0.5) was between those for the 2-s (x = 0) and 1-s (x = 1.0) films.
Effects of MAPbI3 preparation conditions on device performance and hysteresis
Solar cells were fabricated using P3HT or spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM. (The device architecture used is shown in Fig. 2.) We included P3HT in this study because at present it is the most likely HTM to be used to scale up perovskite solar cells.47 The aim of the present work was to investigate the effect of the preparation conditions and hence morphology on the device performance. Values for all of the device parameters are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). It can be seen from Fig. 6 that Jsc and the PCE systematically decreased with increasing x. These values decreased by a factor of about two as x increased from 0 (2-s devices) to 1.0 (1-s devices) for both cell types studied. This trend follows that reported previously for related 2-s and 1-s devices.14 The ability to systematically tune the Jsc and PCE values between the values for the 2-s and 1-s values is new. The importance of these results is that the morphology control demonstrated here provides a new route for tuning device performance which may be potentially useful for longer term tandem cell applications of perovskites. The performance of the latter cells can rely on careful adjustment of Jsc values for the subcells.48

The values for Voc and FF were not significantly affected by x which is expected because the photoactive layer compositions were the same and the devices were prepared using similar conditions. The highest PCE values obtained were 10.32% and 4.23% for the 2-s (x = 0) devices prepared using spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT, respectively. This difference is likely due to slower recombination for the devices containing spiro-MeOTAD.49J–V Curves for the best 1 & 2-s devices (x = 0.33) are shown in Fig. S10a (ESI†). Comparison of the data showed that the main parameter affecting the PCE was Jsc. Indeed, it can be seen from Fig. S10b (ESI†) that the PCE values were proportional to Jsc.
Consideration of the SEM data (Fig. 1) indicated that the decrease of Jsc and the PCE with increasing x was likely due to an increase in the area of pinholes within the capping layer. This proposal was tested by plotting each parameter as a function of the % coverage determined from the SEM data. The results show that both Jsc (Fig. 6b) and the PCE (Fig. 6c) increased with increasing % coverage. Whilst it is well accepted that high efficiency and capping layer coverage are correlated we are not aware of any studies that have quantified the relationship for MAPbI3 solar cells. Thus, the 1 & 2-s (x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66) capping layer morphologies which provided the best coverage gave the highest Jsc and PCE values, i.e., a high number-density of smaller microcrystals with relatively large meso-crystals. In terms of PCE and Jsc, x = 0.33 gave the best results obtained using the 1 & 2-s deposition approach for each cell type (spiro-MeOTAD and P3HT). The PCE values for those cells were 8.64% and 3.04%, respectively. To obtain increased PCE values using the 1 & 2-s approach higher % coverage values are required.
Whilst PCE hysteresis is an important topic governing perovskite solar cell performance50–52 its origin is not fully understood. Here, we calculated the hysteresis index, H, using:53 (2)where AF and AR are the integrated areas under the forward and reverse J–V curves, respectively. Fig. 7 shows the variation of %H with x for the devices prepared in this study (see also Table S1, ESI†). Irrespective of the HTM the %H value decreased with increasing x and was tuneable. Migration of iodide ions is believed to play a key role in hysteresis51 and this phenomenon is believed to include accumulation of ions at the perovskite/TiO2 interface.54 Interfacial contacts and perovskite morphology have also been shown to affect hysteresis.26,55Fig. 7 shows the %H values for the spiro-MeOTAD and P3HT-based devices were not significantly different. This indifference to HTM type supports the view that the morphology at the perovskite/TiO2 interface was responsible for the hysteresis.56
 Fig. 7  Variation of the hysteresis index with x for various perovskite devices. See Scheme 1 for the meaning of x. 
An explanation for the trend shown in Fig. 7 is that %H was controlled by the MAPbI3 capping layer morphology. Consideration of the SEM images shown in Fig. 1b reveals that the total surface area of the perovskite crystals decreased as x increased, i.e., the high surface area-to-volume ratio meso-crystals were progressively replaced with lower surface area-to-volume ratio microcrystals. Fig. 7 shows that the %H decreased with increasing x. Consequently, it can be suggested from our results that the hysteresis decreased as x increased because of the decrease of the interfacial area at the capping layer MAPbI3/mp-TiO2 interface that occurred.
Proposed conceptual model for 1 & 2-s morphologies
Based upon the results of this study we propose a schematic model for the 1 & 2-s photoactive layer structures (Fig. 8). There were three MAPbI3 crystal environments; microcrystals (≫1 μm), meso-crystals (∼0.1–1 μm) and nanocrystals (∼50–80 nm). Each of these crystal environments controlled different parts of the optoelectronic properties. The mp-TiO2 layer also contained remnant PbI2 nanocrystals and this was more prevalent at the deepest regions of the mp-TiO2 layer. As x increased the average size of the microcrystals increased and their number-density decreased; whereas, the average size of the meso-crystals decreased. The MAPbI3 nanocrystals were the majority MAPbI3 species based on the Scherrer analysis. The microcrystals and meso-crystals were responsible for light scattering. The microcrystals also determined the extent of coverage which, in turn, controlled the PL signal as well as Jsc and PCE.

Conclusions
In this study we have introduced and investigated a new MAPbI3 film preparation method (1 & 2-s) and studied three novel mixed morphology perovskite photoactive films (x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66). SEM data showed evidence of a change in the nucleation and growth mechanism that controlled the morphologies for the 1 & 2-s films. The morphologies were not simply a combination of the 1-s and 2-s morphologies and indicated that a change in nucleation kinetics occurred. The SEM and XRD data showed that the 1 & 2-s films had three MAPbI3 species: micro-, meso- and nanocrystals. The proportion of each crystal type in the final films was controlled by x used during precursor film formation. The 1 & 2-s films showed enhanced light scattering which was due to the combination of meso-crystals and microcrystals. The value of x affected the PL spectra. The PL spectra were strongly weighted by signals typical of the microcrystals in the 1-s (x = 1.0) films. The capping layer coverage was controlled by the morphology and decreased with increasing x and dominated device performance. The MAPbI3/TiO2 interface controlled hysteresis and this was also tuneable. Overall, the data show that the morphologies and optoelectronic properties of the new 1 & 2-s films were not simply a linear combination of the 1-s and 2-s films and were strongly affected by the microcrystals. It is highly likely that the ability to dramatically vary the morphology of perovskite photoactive layers demonstrated in Fig. 1 is transferable to other perovskite types and this topic is currently being explored in our laboratory.

Table Content:

 	Scheme 1  (a) Overall sequence of reactions where x is the stoichiometric ratio of MAI used for the solutions. The other rows depict (b) 2-step deposition (2-s), (c) combined 1 and 2-step deposition (1 & 2-s) and (d) 1-step deposition (1-s) methods. The middle and right hand columns show photographs of precursor and final films, respectively. For (d), which had x = 1.0, there was only a final film. The dimensions of the films were ∼2.0 cm × 1.5 cm.	 

 	Fig. 1  SEM images showing morphologies of precursor (a) and final (b) MAPbI3 films. The variation of coverage with stoichiometric ratio (x) (Scheme 1) for the precursor and final films is shown in (c) and was determined from the images shown in (a and b), respectively. The scale bars for SEM images on the left and right hand sides of (a and b) are 20 μm and 200 nm, respectively. Note that the precursor film for x = 0 was PbI2.	 

 	Fig. 2  Proposed nucleation and growth of MAPbI3 crystals prepared by the 1 & 2-s deposition method (Scheme 1) and their locations within the solar cell geometry used.

 	Fig. 3  (a) X-ray diffractograms for final MAPbI3 films prepared using 2-s (x = 0), 1 & 2-s (x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66) and 1-s (x = 1.0) methods. The diffractogram for PbI2 is shown for comparison. (b) Variation of the %amplitude for the films from (a) with x (see text). (c) Average size determined from the Scherrer equation as a function of x.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) UV-visible spectra of the precursor films. The spectrum for x = 0 corresponds to PbI2. (b) UV-visible spectra for the final MAPbI3 films. (c) Absorbance at 900 nm as a function of x for the precursor and final films. The values of x used for the PbI2 + xMAI solutions are shown.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) PL spectra for MAPbI3 films. The values for x are shown. (b) Maximum PL intensity as a function of x. (c) Variation of the band-edge emission peak wavelength with x. The data were taken from (a). The excitation wavelength used was 460 nm.	 

 	Fig. 6  (a) Variations of Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE with x for solar cells prepared using P3HT and spiro-MeOTAD as the HTMs. (b and c) Show the Jsc and PCE values, respectively, as a function of % coverage (from Fig. 1c).	 
	(2)

 	Fig. 7  Variation of the hysteresis index with x for various perovskite devices. See Scheme 1 for the meaning of x.	 

 	Fig. 8  Schematic depicting the proposed structure of the 1 & 2-s (x = 0.33, 0.50 and 0.66) photoactive layers. The three types of MAPbI3 crystals are depicted and are not drawn to scale.
