1. Introduction
2D materials have attracted much attention due to their unique physical properties and large surface area, and many 2D materials, including graphene,1,2 transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs),3–5 monolayer III(IV) monochalcogenides,6–9 and black phosphorus (BP),10,11 have been investigated widely. With high carrier mobility and tunable band gaps, these 2D materials find potential applications in photocatalysts,6,7,12 field effect transistors,10,13 and photovoltaics.14 Recently, Janus 2D materials have emerged as the research hot spot. Most reported 2D Janus materials are mechanical, thermally, and dynamically stable.15–17 Moreover, 2D Janus MoSSe can be successfully synthesized by sulfurization of MoSe2 or selenization of MoS2.18,19 Compared to pristine 2D materials, 2D Janus materials lose their mirror symmetry and generate an internal vertical electric field, giving rise to many new phenomena such as enhanced out-of-plane piezoelectric coefficients,20–22 increased carrier mobility,23,24 and significant Rashba splitting.24–27 First-principles calculations also predicted that some 2D Janus materials are intrinsically ferromagnetic, such as Janus FeXY (X, Y = Cl, Br, and I, X ≠ Y)28 and Janus Cr2I3X3 (X = Br, Cl) monolayers.29
With the rise of 2D materials, the 2D van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures formed by stacking one 2D material with the other one has become one branch in the field of 2D materials. Experimentally, high-quality vdW heterojunctions can be prepared using a two-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth method.30,31 The 2D vdW heterostructures provide a method to tune the properties of 2D materials, and a typical example is that the graphene/h-BN heterostructures can help graphene open a bandgap and achieve improved current on/off ratio.32–34 Special processes are also reported in 2D vdW heterostructures. For example, the excited carriers in MoS2 can overcome the pretty strong exciton binding energy and transfer to the WS2 side in vdW MoS2/WS2 heterostructures through an ultrafast process.34–36 The existence of interlayer excitons in these TMD vdW heterojunctions has also been proved by both theoretical and experimental evidence.37,38 Recently, several researchers have explored Janus TMDs as components for building vdW heterostructures, and Dipesh et al. provided a room-temperature technique to synthesize vertical and lateral heterojunctions of 2D Janus TMDs.39 It has been reported that Rashba splitting can be enhanced in these 2D Janus heterostructures and carrier lifetime extension can be achieved by their type-II band alignment.26,40–42 Constructing vdW heterostructures has become an effective and feasible method for 2D Janus materials to improve their properties and extend their possible applications.
Recently, InSe has attracted intense attention due to its efficient photocatalytic activity and high carrier mobility,6,13 and has been reported to be thermally stable and have a wide absorption spectrum (∼105 cm−1) in the visible and ultraviolet regions.43,44 Experimentally, InSe films have been successfully prepared and exhibit high electron mobility at room temperature.45,46 Herein, we used pristine InSe and Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) as one building block to stack with BP and constructed vdW heterostructures, and investigated their atomic structures and possible applications in photovoltaics with first-principles calculations. We first systematically explored the atomic and electronic structures of BP, InSe, and Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) and revealed the existence of a vertical internal intrinsic field at Janus monolayers. Then, we constructed vdW heterostructures with a mismatch of less than 5% and explored their interface atomic and electronic structures. Our results demonstrated that all the vdW heterostructures belong to type-II band alignment, which is independent of the vertical electric field of the Janus monolayer, the built-in dipole at the interface, and the number of layers. In addition, the vdW heterostructures show stronger light absorption compared to monolayer individuals and exhibit an excellent photoelectric power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to about 21%. These extraordinary results indicate that these vdW heterostructures have great potential applications in more efficient solar photovoltaics.
2. Computational method
All first-principles calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation package (VASP) based on DFT with a plane-wave basis set.47 To treat the exchange–correlation interaction of electrons, we chose the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional48 within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The electron–ion interactions were described using the projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials.49 The energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis was chosen as 550 eV. Uniform k-point meshes with a spacing of 0.02 Å−1 were adopted to sample the Brillouin zone. A convergence criterion of 10−5 eV for total energy and 0.02 eV Å−1 for force was adopted for self-consistent calculation and geometry optimization, respectively. Grimme's semi-empirical DFT-D3 method was adopted to describe the long-range vdW interactions.50 To avoid the interaction between adjacent layers, a vacuum spacing of 20 Å was added along the direction perpendicular to the 2D surface. Based on the equilibrium structures calculated by PBE calculation, more accurate band structures and optical absorption spectra of BP, InSe, and Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) were obtained using the Heyd–Scuseri–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional.51 The optical absorption spectra of vdW heterostructures were also calculated using the HSE06 functional.
3. Results and discussion
We first investigated the atomic and electronic structures of BP, InSe and Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te). As shown in Fig. 1, 2D BP exhibits folded honeycomb structures, and each P atom is connected to three neighboring P atoms. The 2D InSe monolayer shows honeycomb structures and consists of four atom layers, including two outer Se atom layers and two inner In atom layers. In order to get the Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) monolayer, we replaced one outer Se atom layer with an X atom layer, as shown in Fig. 1(c) and (d). The lattice constants of BP, InSe and Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) are listed in Table 1, which are similar to previous results.6,7,45,52 The band structures of each monolayer are shown in Fig. 1 (middle panels), and the corresponding electronic structure information is listed in Table 1. The BP monolayer shows a direct band gap of 0.86 eV from PBE calculation and 1.59 eV from HSE06 calculation, with the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) located at the Γ point. The effective mass of both electrons and holes in the BP monolayer shows obvious anisotropy, with carriers being much heavier along the zigzag direction than the armchair direction. The pristine InSe shows an indirect band gap of 1.57 eV from PBE calculation and 2.28 eV from HSE06 calculation, with the CBM located at the Γ point and the CBM located slightly away from the Γ point. The electronic structures of Janus In2SeS are similar to those of pristine InSe, and the band gaps determined from PBE and HSE06 calculations are 1.73 eV and 2.36 eV, respectively. Janus In2SeTe exhibits a direct band gap of 1.17 eV from PBE calculation and 1.78 eV from HSE06 calculation, with both the CBM and VBM located at the Γ point. Moreover, the carrier effective mass is slightly lighter than that of pristine InSe and Janus In2SeS, as listed in Table 1.

The projected planar average potentials along the z direction for BP, InSe and Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) are shown in Fig. 1 (right panels). The average potentials exhibit obvious symmetry in both BP and pristine InSe while this symmetry is not observed in either of the two Janus monolayers. That is because the lack of mirror symmetry in the Janus monolayer results in non-uniform distributions of charge and the emergence of an internal electric field in Janus monolayers. Careful analysis demonstrates that the –Se terminated surface in Janus In2SeTe and the –S terminated surface in Janus In2SeS has higher average vacuum potential energy, which indicates that the electric field points from the –Te terminated surface to the –Se terminated surface in Janus In2SeTe and points from the –Se terminated surface to the –S terminated surface in Janus In2SeS, as depicted by the orange arrows in each right panel of Fig. 1(c) and (d). The average vacuum potential energy shifts of Janus In2SeTe and In2SeS (ΔE) are listed in Table 1.
The band alignments are important parameters for heterostructures as they determine how photo-produced carriers transfer at interfaces. Usually, a type-II alignment can help the separation of electron–hole pairs and is expected for efficient photovoltaic application. Following the Anderson limit,8,53 we can obtain the conduction band offset (CBO) and valence band offset (VBO) by directly comparing their electron affinity (χ) and ionization energy (I), respectively. The electron affinity (χ) and ionization energy (I) are calculated as follows: χ =  − EVBM(1) I =  − ECBM(2)where , EVBM and ECBM are the average vacuum potential, VBM and CBM of 2D materials, respectively. As listed in Table 1, the two different terminated surfaces of Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) show different values of χ and I due to the vertical internal electronic field. By aligning the vacuum potentials energy of all 2D materials, we got the band alignment at the Anderson limit, as shown in Fig. 2(a) and Fig. S1(a) (ESI†). It can be seen that the BP monolayer shows a type-II band alignment with the InSe monolayer, and with Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) monolayer irrespective of the surface termination of the Janus monolayer, and these results are also independent of the PBE or HSE06 functional.

Since experimentally fabricated two-dimensional materials are usually multilayered, we also calculate the band alignment of BP and InSe/Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) at the Anderson limit for bilayers and trilayers. Typically, the layered group-III monochalcogenides crystallize in several polymorphs, the most common being the ε-, β-, and γ-polymorphs with space groups of Pm2, P63/mmc, and R3m, respectively.54 We compared the three phases for InSe and Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) and selected those with the lowest energy per layer in the unit cell. As listed in Table S1 (ESI†), both InSe and Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) tend to crystallize in the γ-polycrystalline form. Based on the most stable configuration, we cut the surface along the (001) direction to obtain the InSe and Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) with bilayers and trilayers. For isolated BP, we chose the phase with the space group of Cmca,11 and cut the surface along (001) direction to obtain the BP bilayer and trilayer. The atomic structure information of isolated BP, InSe, and Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) with bilayers and trilayers after complete atomic position and lattice relaxation, and their electronic structure information, are presented in Table S2 (ESI†). By the alignment of the vacuum potential energy of all 2D materials, we obtained their band alignment at the Anderson limit. Fig. 2(b) and (c) display the band alignment at the Anderson limit for bilayer and trilayer systems calculated with the HSE06 functional, respectively, and Fig. S1(b) and (c) (ESI†) show the band alignment at the Anderson limit for bilayer and trilayer systems calculated with the PBE functional, respectively. It can be seen that several heterostructures calculated with the PBE functional exhibit type-III band alignment. However, in the case of bilayers and trilayers calculated with the HSE06 functional, the type-II band alignment is maintained.
In order to explore the band alignment and behaviors after two domains come into contact, we constructed vdW heterostructures by stacking the BP monolayer with the InSe or Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) monolayer vertically. Due to two different surface terminations of the Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) monolayer, there are two possible vdW heterostructures for BP/In2SeX (X = S or Te). To distinguish them, we named them BP/In2SeX–Se and BP/In2SeX–X. In total, we obtained 5 vdW heterostructures including BP/InSe, BP/In2SeS–Se, BP/In2SeS–S, BP/In2SeTe–Se, and BP/In2SeTe–Te. We constructed vdW supercells following the processes given below: (1) the (1 × 1) diamond unit cell of InSe or Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) was rebuilt into a () rectangle unit cell; (2) supercells of BP and InSe or In2SeX (X = S or Te) were made, helping them match with each other with a smaller mismatch. The detailed supercell at each vdW heterostructure is listed in Table 2. The mismatch is defined as: (3)where aBP and a are the lattice constants of BP and InSe or In2SeX (X = S or Te) supercells, respectively. (3) The supercell of BP and InSe or In2SeX (X = S or Te) was stretched or compressed to their average sizes, and then the BP supercell was matched with InSe or In2SeX (X = S or Te) supercells perfectly in a vdW heterostructure supercell. The atomic structures of the 5 vdW heterostructure supercell model are shown in Fig. 3, and the corresponding information is listed in Table 2. With full relaxation, the average vertical distance between BP and InSe or In2SeX (X = S or Te) is similar and about 3.1 Å. The interactions between two building monolayers can be characterized by the binding energy defined as: (4)where EvdW, EBP, and E are the total energy of vdW heterostructures, BP supercells, and InSe or In2SeX (X = S or Te) supercells, respectively, and n is the number of BP unit cells in the vdW heterostructure supercell. The binding energy of 5 heterostructures are in the range of −82.33 to −70.42 meV, which are similar to other vdW heterostructures.5,55,56 The negative binding energy demonstrates that these vdW heterostructures can be synthesized in the experiment.

The supercell demonstrates that there are (n1 × n2) BP unit cells and (m1 × m2) InSe or Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) unit cells in a vdW heterostructure supercell

To gain a visible and deep understanding of the interaction between two domains of heterostructures, we calculated the charge density difference of 5 vdW heterostructures. The charge density differences are calculated as follows: Δρ = ρvdw − ρBP − ρ(5)where ρvdw, ρBP, and ρ are the charge density of vdW heterostructures, the BP domain, and InSe or Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) monolayer domains, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4, the yellow and blue regions indicate charge accumulation and depletion, respectively, and obvious charge redistribution occurs clearly in the interface region for all 5 heterostructures. Furthermore, we projected the charge density difference along the perpendicular interface and normalized it into one unit cell of BP. By defining the middle boundary of two domains as the ‘real interface’, we integrated the charge density difference on the two sides of the interface to reveal the charge transfer between the interface. The detailed analysis demonstrates that the electrons transfer from the InSe or Janus domain side to the BP side (as listed in Table 2), which is consistent with the higher Fermi level of BP. This electron transfer can produce a built-in electric field pointed into BP, which may affect the band alignment. We will discuss later.

The black, grey, and light purple dashed lines indicate the positions of the interface, InSe/Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te), and BP, respectively. The inset plots are corresponding charge density differences with an isosurface value of 0.3 me Å−3, and the yellow and blue regions indicate charge accumulation and depletion, respectively. 
Based on the fully optimized structure of 5 vdW heterostructures, we further investigated their electronic structures. From the projected band structures and project density of states (PDOS) of 5 heterostructures in Fig. 5, it is evident that all the heterostructures maintain a band gap, and the CBM and VBM are mainly contributed by the BP and InSe or Janus monolayers, respectively. The partial charge density of the VBM and CBM also demonstrate the contribution of BP and InSe or Janus monolayers at the band edges of heterostructures, all of which confirm the type-II band alignment in the 5 heterostructures. With this band alignment, the photo-excited electrons prefer to transfer to the InSe or Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) side as shown in Fig. 7(a), while the photo-excited holes tend to transfer to the BP side, which can help carriers prolong their lifetime. Furthermore, we calculated the effective mass of electrons and holes for each heterostructure, which is listed in Table 2. We can see that the effective mass of carriers is anisotropic and the effective mass of electrons is similar to that of InSe or Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) and the effective mass of holes is similar to that of BP, which is consistent with the type-II band alignment. Compared with isolated InSe or Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te), the electron effective mass of heterostructures along the armchair direction is reduced, which is beneficial for carrier separation. To explore the influence of the interface dipole on band alignment, we obtained the VBO and CBO by directly comparing the VBM and CBM of BP and InSe or Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) in heterostructures and further compared them with those calculated at the Anderson limit. As listed in Table 2, the VBO of all heterostructures is smaller than those at the Anderson limit, while all the CBO are larger than those at the Anderson limit, which is because the built-in interface dipoles raise the energy levels of BP and lower those of InSe or Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te).

(f) The Brillouin zone and high symmetry points of vdW supercells. 
Optical absorption is an important parameter for photovoltaic applications, and we calculated the optical absorption spectra of all five vdW heterostructures to check their potential to utilize sunlight. As shown in Fig. 6, the optical absorption coefficients of the 5 vdW heterostructures are anisotropic, and the absorption behavior of these vdW heterostructures along the armchair direction is stronger than that along the zigzag direction, especially in the visible and infrared regions. As a comparison, the optical absorption spectra of isolated BP, InSe, and Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) are also shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that the vdW heterostructure exhibits a clear absorption peak in the infrared regions along the armchair direction, which corresponds to the reduced band gap due to the type II band alignment. In addition, all the designed vdW heterostructures exhibit stronger light absorption in the visible region compared to monolayer individuals, indicating that these vdW heterostructures have the ability to utilize sunlight more efficiently. We further calculated the PCE for all type-II heterostructures in photovoltaic applications following Scharber's method,57 in which the upper limit of PCE in the limit of 100% external quantum efficiency can be expressed as follows: (6)where the band-fill factor deduced from the Shockley–Queasier limit is assumed to be 0.65. P(ℏ) is the AM1.5 solar energy flux at the photon energy ℏ. The maximum open circuit voltage Voc is estimated from the effective interface gap minus 0.3 eV to account for the energy conversion kinetics. In all heterostructures, BP serves as the donor, and the CBO at the Anderson limit calculated with the HSE06 functional is used. As shown in Fig. 7(b), the PCE values of monolayer BP/In2SeTe–Te and trilayer BP/In2SeTe–Te heterostructures are 20.81% and 21.07%, respectively, which are comparable with those reported for other 2D vdW heterostructures, such as phosphorene/MoS2 (16–18%), GeSe/SnS (∼18%), TiNF/TiNBr (18%) and TiNCl/TiNBr (19%) solar cell systems.58–60 Note that this method is within the limit of 100% external quantum efficiency and the predicted PCE still needs to be confirmed by experiments.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we explored the atomic and electronic structures of BP, InSe and Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) with first-principles calculations, and revealed the existence of a vertical internal electric field pointing from the –Te terminated surface into the –Se terminated surface in Janus In2SeTe and pointing from the –Se terminated surface into the –S terminated surface in Janus In2SeS. Then, we stacked BP monolayers with InSe and Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) monolayers vertically and constructed 5 vdW heterostructures with a mismatch of less than 5%, including BP/InSe, BP/In2SeS–Se, BP/In2SeS-S, BP/In2SeTe–Se, and BP/In2SeTe–Te. Our results demonstrate that the constructed vdW heterostructures can be synthesized experimentally. Compared with the individual BP, InSe or Janus In2SeX (X = S or Te) monolayer, the vdW heterostructures exhibit a bit lighter electron effective mass. A type-II band alignment can be found in all the vdW heterostructures, and is independent of the internal electric field of Janus monolayers, the built-in dipole at the interface between two domains, and the number of layers. In addition, the vdW heterostructures show stronger light absorption compared to monolayer individuals, and the type-II band alignment can help photo-excited carriers to separate and achieve an excellent photoelectric power conversion efficiency up to about 21% in these heterostructures. These extraordinary results make these vdW heterostructures competitive candidates for next-generation photovoltaic and photocatalytic devices.
