    , Accepted 29th April 2014First published on 30th April 2014AbstractThe charge carrier dynamics of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) organic bulk-heterojunction photovoltaics with and without TiO2 nanowires are studied. Using inorganic nanowires as electron transport pathways improves the charge transit time and electron diffusion coefficient, which is the origin of fill factor and power conversion efficiency improvement observed in these devices. Through further comparison of devices with surface-modified nanowires (PCB–TiO2-NW), it is found that under AM 1.5 light illumination, charge recombination is dominant in the organic layer rather than at the TiO2 nanowire surface.
Introduction
Conjugated polymer-based organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted great interest as an inexpensive technology for harvesting energy from sunlight.1–3 The potential low cost of OPVs originates from the solution processability of conjugated polymers. However, there are also drawbacks in using conjugated polymers in photovoltaic applications; the charge transport of OPVs is limited by the low intrinsic charge mobilities, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is further limited by the excitons (bound electron–hole pair) that form upon photoexcitation in conjugated polymers. To dissociate the excitons into free charge carriers, they must migrate to an interface between the donor and acceptor materials, and the difference between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of the donor and acceptor must be at least 0.3 eV to overcome the exciton binding energy.4,5 Excitons can typically only diffuse about 10 nm before decaying.4,6 As such, well-mixed donor and acceptor phases with dimensions on the order of 20 nm are necessary for efficient exciton dissociation,7–9 which is why the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure is the most commonly used device architecture.10–12 However, the tortuous charge transport pathways in BHJs, coupled with the already low intrinsic charge mobilities of the organic materials, yields poor charge transport at the device level thereby limiting device efficiencies.
Recently, we had shown that introducing small quantities of TiO2 nanowires without surface modifiers into the active layer of BHJ OPVs could improve the PCE in these devices, and by only using a small quantity of TiO2 nanowires, we were able to maintain the simple one-step solution-processing procedure to prepare the active layer of the devices.13,14 Moreover, by controlling both the dimension and dispersion of nanowires, we were able to minimize impact of adding nanowires on the active layer morphology.13,14 Our previous research showed that the PCE improvement was likely a result of the introduction of efficient electron transport pathways in the active layer as indicated by the increased electron mobilities observed by space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements.13,14 Others have shown that the use of TiO2 nanorods can reduce device performance because of surface traps and defects, and that TiO2 surface modification is necessarily to suppress recombination.15,16 To understand the roles of inorganic nanostructures embedded in the active layers of OPVs, a deeper understanding of charge carrier dynamics, such as charge recombination, is required.
One method to probe the charge carrier dynamics of organic–inorganic interfaces is impedance spectroscopy (IS), which involves frequency analysis of a device's AC behavior. IS has been used to look at charge carrier dynamics in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs),17–20 quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs),21,22 and solid hole conductors.23,24 More recently, IS has been applied to OPVs by Bisquert et al. to obtain recombination lifetimes, charge transit times, and electron diffusion coefficients.25–27
In this study, we investigate the charge carrier dynamics in P3HT:PCBM photovoltaic devices with and without TiO2-NWs using IS. Additionally, the effects of TiO2-NW surface modification were also examined to assess observations that such modification is necessary to reduce surface charge trapping28–30 and back recombination.15,31,32
Experimental
Material preparation
TiO2 nanowires were grown on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (TEC 15, Hartford Glass Co.) by hydrothermal synthesis according to a modified literature procedure.33 Titanium isopropoxide (0.15 g) was added to 10 mL of a 1:1 mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and water. After stirring for several minutes, the clear colorless solution was decanted into a Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave (45 mL, Parr Instrument Co.). Two FTO slides were placed at an angle inside the vessel with the conductive side facing downwards. The nanowires were grown at 150 °C for 7.5 h to achieve lengths of ∼3 μm. Then, the TiO2-NW was scratched off the substrate, placed in ethanol, and sonicated for at least 3 h. After sonication, the ethanol with TiO2-NW was drop cast on another glass substrate. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken to check the separation of TiO2-NWs. If the TiO2-NWs were well separated, they were scratched off again and weighed on a balance to get the desired amount.
C60-substitued benzoic acid used in surface modification of nanowires was synthesized according to ref. 34. A mixture of 4-carboxybenzaldehyde, C60, and N-methylglycine was dissolved in chlorobenzene, and the solution was refluxed overnight under a nitrogen atmosphere (Scheme 1). The solvent was removed by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure. The product was purified by silica gel column chromatography with toluene to toluene–THF (2:1) as the eluents to afford a brown-yellow solid. Then, C60-subsituted benzoic acid was dissolved in THF–ethanol (1:1) at 0.2 mg mL−1 concentration After the solution was prepared, 0.2 mg mL−1 TiO2-NW was added to start coating, and the mixture was kept stirring and heated at 60 °C for 40 h. Next, this surface-modified TiO2-NW (PCB–TiO2-NW) was centrifuged and washed with THF several times to remove any excessive PCB acid. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (Fig. S1†) were taken to confirm surface modification.

Device fabrication
ITO-coated glass substrates (15 Ω m−2) were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with detergent, deionized (DI) water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. Substrates were then taken out and dried under N2 flow followed by air plasma treatment for 15 min. A hole-transport layer of poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxylene thiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios P VP Al 4083) was spin-coated onto the ITO surface from its aqueous solution (40 nm thick). The films were baked at 140 °C for 10 min before being transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove-box. The chlorobenzene solution, which contained 25 mg mL−1 P3HT (Reike Metal, Sepiolid P100) and 15 mg mL−1 PCBM (American Dye Source Inc. ADS61BFB), was stirred inside the glovebox for at least 3 h at 60 °C. The active layers of control devices were achieved by directly spin-coating the P3HT:PCBM solution to form a 140 nm thick layer. In both NW devices, 0.2 wt% of TiO2 was added to the P3HT:PCBM solution. For devices with TiO2-NW, the TiO2-NW was added into the solution and taken out of the glovebox to sonicate for 30 min. For PCB–TiO2-NW, the nanowires were dispersed in solution by stirring. This solution was kept stirring before it was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS to achieve the same thickness active layer as the control group. Subsequently, all the devices were transferred into a deposition chamber inside the glovebox and 100 nm of Al were thermally evaporated under a vacuum of 5 × 10−7 Torr. Finally, the devices were completed by annealing at 150 °C for varying times.
Device characterization
The J–V characteristics of the solar cells were tested using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit, and an Oriel Xenon lamp (450 W) coupled with an AM 1.5 filter (which was used as the light source). The light intensity was determined using a calibrated standard silicon solar cell with a KG5 filter traceable to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. A light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 was used in all of the measurements in this study. Device parameters were obtained by taking the average of at least 20 samples for each processing condition. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements were performed using an Agilent HP 4278A, applying a small voltage perturbation (20 mV rms). Different light intensities were obtained using combinations of absorptive neutral density filters (Thorlabs Inc.). Measurements were carried out at open-circuit voltage condition at each light intensity sweeping frequencies from 1 MHz down to 20 Hz.
Result and discussion
The devices used for both IS and photovoltaic characterization share the same structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Al. However, IS measurements were taken at varying light intensities while PV measurements were made using a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. To force the photovoltaic device to operate under recombination conditions, voltages equal to the open-circuit voltage (Voc) at each light intensity were applied so that the photocurrent was nullified by the applied bias.25 Under this condition, a major RC arc plus additional minor features at higher frequencies characterize the spectra (Fig. 1). At higher frequencies, information regarding transport and series resistance elements can be extracted, while at the lower frequencies, information about recombination in the active layer and thus the effective charge carrier lifetime can be obtained.25–27

In order to obtain quantitative information on carrier dynamics in OPVs, the transmission line model accounting for different impedance responses was employed.18,25,27 The equivalent circuit in this model (Fig. 2) consists of: (1) distributed resistors representing carrier transport, rt = Rt/L, where L is the active layer thickness; (2) distributed chemical capacitance cμ = CμL; (3) rrec = Rrec/L, which accounts for the recombination resistance.18,27 Furthermore, from these elements, several characteristic parameters related to the charge carrier dynamics in the device can be derived,18,25,27 such as recombination time (effective carrier lifetime): τrec = RrecCμ(1)carrier transit time: τdiff = RtCμ(2)and therefore the charge diffusion coefficient: (3)

Distributed elements related to carrier transport (rt), recombination (rrec), chemical capacitance (Cμ); series resistance (Rs), Rco, Cco parallel subcircuit simulates the contact between active layer and top electrode. 
The fitting results of Rt, Rrec and Cμ for all three devices (Fig. 3) show trends typical of those reported previously for OPVs.25,35,36 The increase of chemical capacitance with Voc follows the shape of a Gaussian distribution, and in the tested Voc range it reflects the shape of the density of states of electrons.25,26 Both Rt and Rrec of all devices decrease with increasing Voc due to the higher charge carrier density from higher illumination. However, devices with TiO2-NW and PCB–TiO2-NW show a faster decay in Rt with increase in charge carrier density, while Rrec values are similar in all three devices. Moreover, Rt exceeds Rrec above 0.55 V for the three devices, which implies that at higher light intensities (>2.5 mW cm−2), devices are highly recombining for voltages around Voc,37 and that the performance is limited by the transport of carriers.

From the fitting results, the effective carrier lifetime, charge transit time and charge diffusion coefficients were calculated by using eqn (1)–(3), and the results are shown in Fig. 4. The charge carrier density was calculated by integrating the chemical capacitance at a given Voc.25 Surprisingly, at higher charge densities (>1016 cm−3), the effective lifetimes are similar in all three devices, indicating similar recombination rates in all three devices at high illumination intensity (i.e. at typical OPV testing conditions) despite the presence of possible surface traps and defects introduced by the TiO2. However, at lower charge densities (∼1015 cm−3), the effective lifetime was observed to be the highest in P3HT:PCBM and lowest in TiO2-NW containing devices, followed by devices with PCB–TiO2-NW. The slower recombination rate observed in surface-modified TiO2-NW compared to the unmodified TiO2-NW is presumably due to the passivation of surface traps, consistent with previous reports.31,32,38

In contrast to the effective carrier lifetimes, nearly one order of magnitude improvements were found in the charge transit time and thus the charge diffusion coefficient of devices with nanowires at higher charge carrier densities, confirming our previous results where enhanced electron mobilities were observed in TiO2-NW containing devices.13,14 However, at low charge carrier densities, the charge transit times and the charge diffusion coefficients were the same across all three devices. Additionally, at higher charge densities, an increase in charge diffusion coefficient with increasing charge carrier density was observed for devices with nanowires. The change in the charge transit time and diffusion coefficient in devices with nanowires can be explained by the multiple-trapping model suggested by the previous charge transport studies in nanostructured TiO2.39,40 Electrons are mobile only when they de-trap to a high-energy conduction band, or mobility edge. The more electrons injected, the higher the de-trapping rate, and therefore mobility increases.39,40
The charge transit times and diffusion coefficients show that at low charge carrier densities, charges move primarily through the organic materials, while at high charge carrier densities, charges move through the TiO2 nanowires. We speculate that at low charge carrier densities, the charge transfer from the organic to TiO2 does not occur because of recombination at the NW surface; however, at high charge carrier densities, the TiO2 surface traps are filled, suppressing recombination and thereby allowing charge transfer to TiO2. The IS data confirm that recombination is dominant in TiO2 at low charge carrier densities, while recombination is dominant in the organic at high charge carrier densities (i.e. at typical OPV testing conditions).

Fig. 5 shows the J–V characteristics of devices with and without nanowires. The important device parameters are summarized in Table 1. Both devices with nanowires show improvement in PCE, and the dominating factor in their efficiency enhancement is the increase in FF. Based on the IS analysis of the aforementioned devices, this increase in FF can be attributed to the improved charge transport afforded by the nanowires. Moreover, slightly higher average Jsc values were also found in devices with nanowires. In comparison to devices with TiO2-NW, devices with PCB–TiO2-NW exhibit no further improvement in PCE. This result is consistent with their similar effective lifetime, diffusion coefficient and charge transit time at high carrier density obtained from IS measured at 100 mW cm−2 light intensity—the same light intensity used in J–V characterization. Recombination at the TiO2 nanowire surface is thus not a dominant factor that affects performance in this set of devices under AM 1.5 light illumination.

Our results contradict those found by others, where surface modification of TiO2 nanorods yielded substantial increases in PCEs.15,16 We believe that this difference stems from the fact that only a very small amount of TiO2 (0.2 wt%) is used in our devices, compared with ∼50 wt% in previous studies.15,16 Moreover, at 3 μm lengths, the NWs have substantially smaller surface-to-volume ratios compared to the ∼30 nm × 5 nm nanorods used previously.15,16 As such, TiO2 surface traps are rapidly filled with increasing charge carrier density under AM 1.5 illumination, eliminating the need to use surface modifiers. The fact that the diffusion coefficient in PCB–TiO2-NW containing devices saturates at lower charge carrier densities compared to devices containing TiO2-NW shows that surface modification does help to a certain extent, just not under typical OPV testing conditions.
Conclusion
By applying IS analysis at open-circuit conditions, the charge carrier dynamics of devices with OPVs containing TiO2 nanowires were studied. Improvements in the charge transit time and electron diffusion coefficient were directly observed in devices with nanowires, which explains the PCE and FF improvement in the photovoltaic devices. The faster increase in diffusion coefficient as a function of charge carrier density in devices with PCB–TiO2-NW compared to devices with TiO2-NW reflects an improved interface between the nanowires and organic materials in the active layer. More importantly, from IS analysis and J–V characterization of devices with unfunctionalized and functionalized nanowires, similar diffusion coefficients and charge carrier lifetimes were found at high charge carrier density (i.e. under standard 100 mW cm−2 light intensity), indicating that by using small quantities of high-aspect-ratio TiO2 nanowires, recombination at the nanowire surface can be minimized and the nanowires used as efficient charge conduits.
