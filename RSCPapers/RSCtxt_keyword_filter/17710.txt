    , Accepted 17th February 2014First published on 19th February 2014AbstractPlatinum (Pt) nanoparticles below 2 nm loaded on In2O3 nanooctahedra were prepared with the assistance of polymer ligands, and applied as efficient difunctional counter electrode (CE) materials for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Owing to the excellent light scattering performance of regular nanooctahedra, the light harvesting efficiency was significantly increased, resulting in the noticeable 19.5% enhancement of energy conversion efficiency.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have been regarded as promising candidates for the next-generation photovoltaic devices due to their low cost, easy fabrication, and relatively high light-to-electric energy conversion efficiency.1,2 In order to enhance the efficiency of DSCs, numerous advances have been made in developing sensitizing dyes,2 electrolytes,3–5 catalysts on counter electrodes (CEs)6–10 and new cell structures.11–13 Moreover, correct optical design is essential to achieve high efficiency with solar cells, and the DSCs are no exception. One of the most common principles is trying to boost the light absorption by the various light-trapping or back-reflection techniques. These photon management techniques used in DSCs include difunctional photoanodes with a three-dimensional light scattering structure,14–16 plasmonic particles or structure in a TiO2 photoanode film,17,18 a back scattering layer or nanostructure at the TiO2/electrolyte interface,19,20 modified electrolytes21 and a back scattering layer at CEs.22,23 For example, Wang et al.19 introduced a scattering layer of cubic CeO2 nanoparticles at the TiO2 anode and achieved an efficient light harvesting efficiency. However, a study on CEs with light back-reflection and electrocatalytic activity for triiodide (I3−) reduction difunction has rarely been reported. Diau et al.22 applied a mirror-like platinum (Pt) electrode as the CE with specular reflection function. In this case, the CE has two functions – photo management and catalytic function, which means that the DSC device doesn't need an extra light-scattering layer. However, the mirror-like Pt CE owns a high cost and specular reflection is not the best reflected pattern. According to the literature,24–28via bottom-up assembling of regular nanocrystals, tunable optical structures can be obtained. In this direction, one can prepare a Pt CE with light-scattering function via the assembling of Pt nanocrystals with well-defined facets, but it would consume very large amounts of Pt.
Herein, we for the first time proposed that we could explore a Pt catalyst on a regular support as an efficient CE with light-scattering function, which takes the advantages of excellent physical properties of the support such as the high electric conductivity10 and the regular structure for light-scattering. Also the Pt nanoparticles loaded on a regular carrier with small size could increase the utilization efficiency and electrocatalytic activity of the Pt catalyst (see Fig. 1). Following this proposal, we prepared size-controlled Pt nanoparticles loaded on regular In2O3 (Pt@In2O3) nanooctahedra using a polymer as a stabilizer. The application of the Pt@In2O3 in CEs resulted in about 18.7% enhancement of the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of DSCs. We attribute this improvement to the efficient light harvesting via the light scattering of regular In2O3 nanooctahedra supports.

2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
1-Octadecene (90%), and oleic acid (90%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (analytical reagent grade) and sodium borohydride (96%, analytical reagent grade) were obtained from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Indium(III) acetate (99.99%) was purchased from Alfa.
2.2 Synthesis of In2O3 nanooctahedra
In2O3 nanooctahedra were prepared according to the literature.27 And the details are as follows: under magnetic stirring and heating to 90 °C, 1.0 mmol indium(III) acetate was dissolved in mixed 1.0 mL oleic acid and 4.0 mL 1-octadecene to form 1.0 mmol indium oleate. The resulting colorless solution was then degassed under vacuum at 90 °C for 15 min followed by quickly heating to 320 °C. By maintaining at this temperature for 30 min, a milky white solution was obtained. The product was collected by centrifugation, washed with hexane and alcohol several times.
2.3 Synthesis of Pt@In2O3 samples
In a typical synthesis of Pt@In2O3 samples, 25 mg of In2O3 and 100 mg of poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA) were added into a screw-neck glass bottle containing chloroplatinic acid solution (5 mL, 1 mg mL−1), where PMAA was synthesized according to the literature.29 After the suspension became uniform by sonication, 0.5 mL of freshly prepared sodium borohydride (NaBH4) aqueous solution (10 mg mL−1) was injected for reducing chloroplatinic acid under vigorous stirring, and another 0.5 mL of freshly prepared NaBH4 solution was injected after 2–3 hours, kept stirring overnight. The Pt loading amount was explored by a Varian 710ES Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES). This sample was named as 3.9 wt% Pt@In2O3. In order to control the size of loaded Pt nanoparticles, the amount of ligand was increased from 100 mg to 200 mg, 400 mg and so on, keeping other factors the same, and the obtained samples were named as 2.9 wt% Pt@In2O3 and 0.7 wt% Pt@In2O3, respectively. It has been approved that as the amount of ligand increased, the Pt loading decreased.
2.4 Preparation of dye-covered nanocrystalline-TiO2 electrodes
To prepare the DSC working electrodes, the FTO glass was used as a current collector (8 Ω per square, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan). The commercially-available TiO2 powder, P25 (Degussa, Germany), was used as a raw material. A 12 μm thick layer of P25 was loaded on the FTO glass by the screen printer technique.30 After sintering at 500 °C for 30 min, the TiO2-loaded FTO was immersed in a 5 × 10−4 M solution of the N719 dye (Solaronix SA, Switzerland) in acetonitrile–tert-butyl alcohol (v/v = 1/1) for 20–24 h to complete the sensitizer.
2.5 Preparation of counter electrodes
The 3.9 wt% Pt@In2O3, 2.9 wt% Pt@In2O3 and 0.7 wt% Pt@In2O3 pastes were fabricated as follows: 100 mg of the Pt@In2O3 sample was mixed with 0.8 g anhydrous terpineol and 1.12 g ethyl celluloses in ethanol (10 wt%), followed by stirring and sonication. The contents in dispersion were concentrated by an evaporator and the solid content was made to reach 9.8 wt%. A single layer of the Pt@In2O3 paste was loaded onto FTO by the screen-printing procedure with a geometric area of about 0.36 cm2 and heated under airflow at 450 °C for 30 min. The Pt-electrode was prepared by drop-casting 0.5 mM H2PtCl6–ethanol solution on the clean FTO conductive glass and was then sintered in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 30 min.
2.6 DSCs assembling
The counter electrode and the dye-covered TiO2 electrode were assembled into a sandwich type cell and sealed with a hot-melt gasket of 25 μm (Surlyn 1702, DuPont). A drop of the electrolyte, which is prepared via dissolving 0.60 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.50 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine, and 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate in acetonitrile, was put on the hole in the painted counter electrode. Then the electrolyte was introduced into the cell via vacuum backfilling. The dummy cells for electrochemical impedance spectra measurements were assembled with two identical Pt@In2O3 CEs or Pt loaded FTO, and the electrolyte was the same as the above.
2.7 Characterization
The morphology and structure of the samples were characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL 2100, 200 kV) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI S4800). The Pt loading amount was explored by a Varian 710ES ICP-AES. The diffuse reflectance of the four CEs were scanned on a Cary 500 (Varian, USA) spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere accessory. The IPCE spectra were measured with a Model SR830 DSP Lock-In Amplifier, a Model SR540 Optical Chopper (Stanford Research Corporation, USA), a 7IL/PX150 xenon lamp with power supply and a 7ISW301 Spectrometer. The photocurrent–voltage performance of the DSCs was measured with a Keithley digital source meter (Keithley 2400, USA) and simulated under AM 1.5 illumination. The power of the simulated light was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a Newport Oriel PV reference cell system (model 91150 V). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) experiments were measured with dummy cells in the dark by using an electrochemical workstation (Parstat 2273, Princeton). The frequency range of EIS experiments was from 100 mHz to 1 MHz with an AC modulation signal of 10 mV and a bias DC voltage of 0.60 V. The obtained EIS curves were fitted by the ZSimpWin software. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted in a three-electrode system in an acetonitrile solution of 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 at a scanning rate of 20 mV s−1. The working electrodes were Pt@In2O3 and Pt loaded FTO. The Ag/Ag+ couple was employed as a reference electrode and the counter electrode was a platinum foil.
3. Results and discussion
Since the high electric conductivity of the support is indispensable to the supported electrocatalyst, we choose In2O3 as the support. Regular In2O3 nanooctahedra were synthesized according to the literature,27 and the morphology of the In2O3 nanooctahedra sample was detected by SEM. Further, size-controlled Pt nanoparticles were loaded on In2O3 nanooctahedra with the assistance of PMAA. The light scattering effect was evaluated by measuring the Pt@In2O3 films deposited on the FTO conductive glass via the screen-printing procedure and comparing with the typical Pt film deposited on FTO via thermal decomposition. The films on FTO were scanned on a Cary 500 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere accessory, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that in comparison with the typical Pt film, the Pt@In2O3 samples show remarkable improvement of light reflectance in the light range from 300 to 800 nm, especially from 300 to 600 nm. In particular, the reflectance of 0.7 wt% Pt@In2O3 has increased to 230% at the wavelength around 400 nm compared to the Pt film. The digital images in Fig. S1† show that the Pt CE is black and 0.7 wt% Pt@In2O3 is white with effective light scattering, which benefits the light harvesting of DSCs. This remarkable reflectance is obviously attributed to the strong light scattering with the regular octahedra.

The as-prepared In2O3 nanocrystals and Pt loaded In2O3 nanocrystals were first characterized by SEM. As shown in the SEM images in Fig. 3a, In2O3 nanocrystals have a uniform regular octahedral morphology. While, after Pt nanoparticles were loaded, Fig. 3b shows that not only the uniform regular octahedral morphology of In2O3 has not been changed, but also the regular self-assembled structure of the 0.7 wt% Pt@In2O3 sample indicates that the loaded Pt nanoparticles do not have influence on the light-scattering effect of the support, and the corresponding self-assembled model is shown in Fig. 3c. The loaded Pt nanoparticles and dispersion of the 0.7 wt% Pt@In2O3 sample were characterized via TEM and HRTEM, and the results are shown in Fig. 3d–f (results of other samples are shown in Fig. S2 in ESI†). Fig. S2 presents that as the amount of ligand was increased, the particle size of loaded Pt nanoparticles decreased, which is consistent with the literature.31 As shown in Fig. 3e, 0.7 wt% Pt@In2O3 exhibits a narrow particle size distribution and the particle has an average diameter of 1–2 nm. In Fig. 3f, the HRTEM result shows that the particles on In2O3 are crystalline and the lattice spacing of the fringe corresponds to the (100) plane of Pt, confirming the loaded composition. The as-prepared Pt@In2O3 samples were mixed with ethanol, ethyl cellulose and terpineol and made into a paste using a rotary evaporator. Then, the Pt@In2O3 films were screen-printed on the FTO glass with the obtained paste, and then sintered at 450 °C. The surface structures of 0.7 wt% Pt@In2O3 on FTO were characterized using SEM and the images were given in Fig. 3g. Part of the surface in Fig. 3g showed a self-assembled structure same as that shown in Fig. 3b and c, which benefits the light-scattering effect of the CEs.

The supported catalysts as CEs were subsequently assembled into DSCs to investigate the scattering effect on photovoltaic performance in comparison to the commonly used Pt CE from thermal decomposition. Fig. 4a displays the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves for DSCs with pure Pt, 3.9 wt% Pt@In2O3, 2.9 wt% Pt@In2O3, 0.7 wt% Pt@In2O3 and pure In2O3 nanooctahedra as CEs, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, Jsc of the DSCs assembled with the three Pt@In2O3 samples as CEs are significantly enhanced. Especially, the energy conversion efficiency (η) and Jsc of DSCs with 0.7 wt% Pt@In2O3 CE reach 8.10% and 17.50 mA cm−2, which are respectively approximately 19.5% and 18.7% greater than those of the DSCs with typical Pt CEs (6.78%, 14.75 mA cm−2). We have also prepared several samples with different Pt loading amounts between 3.9 wt% and 0, and the optimal loading amount is 0.7 wt%. The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra offer detailed information on the light harvesting of DSCs and the light scattering efficiency can be explained by the IPCE value in the longer wavelength region.19,32 The IPCE results in Fig. 4b show that the overall IPCE increases considerably by using Pt@In2O3 CEs, especially the 0.7 wt% Pt@In2O3, which is in good agreement with the difference of Jsc values. These interesting results demonstrate that the DSCs with Pt@In2O3 CEs possess more effective light harvesting, which should be attributed to the effective light scattering of regular nanooctahedra. Also, it can be obtained that the fill factors (FF) of the DSCs with 3.9 wt% Pt@In2O3 and 2.9 wt% Pt@In2O3 are lower than those of the typical DSCs with the Pt CE. According to the literature,33 the increased electron transfer rate from TiO2 to I3− is the obvious possible cause for a low FF. Whereas, the formed densified structure of CEs by the packing of In2O3 nanooctahedra could lead to the increased difficulty of electrolyte infiltration into the pores,34 which would inhibit the I3− reduction. This may be the reason for the low FF of DSCs with Pt@In2O3 CEs. But, as the particle size of supported Pt nanoparticles decreases, the electrocatalytic activity of Pt@In2O3 samples may be increased. When the Pt particle size is about 1–2 nm, the FF of DSCs with the 0.7 wt% Pt@In2O3 CE reaches 0.62, similar to that of a typical Pt CE (0.61). In this situation, the I3− species could be reduced in time, making up the weakness of electrolyte infiltration, so that the low concentration of I3− ions would inhibit the electron transfer from the TiO2 to the I3−, resulting in the high FF.

In order to elucidate the electrocatalytic activities of different CE materials for I3− reduction, EIS and CV measurements of Pt@In2O3 and Pt CEs were carried out, and the results are shown in Fig. 4c and d, and the EIS of pure In2O3 nanooctahedra is given in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† The EIS parameters were determined by fitting the impedance spectra using the ZSimpWin software via the circuit model inserted in Fig. 4c, and were summarized in Table 1. The high-frequency intercept on the real axis represents the series resistance (Rs), which is mainly composed of the bulk resistance of CE materials, resistance of the FTO glass substrate, and contact resistance, etc. It can be seen that Rs of three Pt@In2O3 samples<? The sentence beginning “It can be seen that Rs of…” has been altered for clarity, please check that the meaning is correct. > are larger than that of the Pt CE, which affect the Jsc. This result confirms that the enhanced Jsc of DSCs with Pt@In2O3 CEs should be attributed to the effective light scattering of regular nanooctahedra. Rct is a measure of the ease of electron exchange between the electrode and the electrolyte and thus varies inversely with the I3− reduction activity of the CEs.35 From Table 1, Rct of 0.7 wt% Pt@In2O3 is 3.23 Ω, which is smaller than that of Pt (3.88 Ω), 3.9 wt% Pt@In2O3 (6.28 Ω) and 2.9 wt% Pt@In2O3 (7.16 Ω), which means that 0.7 wt% Pt@In2O3 has a higher electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction than other samples, which is beneficial to the increase of FF and η. The high Rct of pure In2O3 nanooctahedra (379.4 Ω) indicates that it has nearly no catalytic activity for I3− reduction, and hence the η of DSCs with it is very low. It can be obtained that the high loading amount of Pt does not help to enhance the electrocatalytic activity. Instead, 0.7 wt% Pt@In2O3 with the smallest Pt particle size and the least loading amount has the best electrocatalytic activity, which means that the smaller the size of the catalyst, the higher the electrocatalytic activity, and the more the utilization degree of it which may be due to its geometric effect.36 From the CV result in Fig. 4d, it can be seen that both Pt@In2O3 and Pt electrodes have similar CV curves with two pair redox peaks. The relatively negative pair corresponds to redox reaction (1), whereas the more positive pair is assigned to the redox reaction (2). I−3 + 2e− ↔ 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I−3(2)
The electrocatalytic activity of the CEs is related to the negative pair. A higher reduction peak current density corresponding to I3− reduction and a lower peak-to-peak voltage separation (Epp) indicates a higher electrocatalytic activity.10,37,38 The relatively high cathodic peak and large Epp observed for 0.7 wt% Pt@In2O3 with respect to Pt and other electrodes suggest a higher electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction than Pt and other samples, which is in consistent with the results of photovoltaic performance and EIS. The optimized Pt nanoparticles with small size supported on In2O3 not only decreased the consumption of Pt, but also enhanced the electrocatalytic activity. Combined with the excellent light scattering of In2O3 nanooctahedra, the difunctional Pt@In2O3 CEs facilitate the high photovoltaic performance of the DSCs with it.
4. Conclusions
In summary, for the first time, we have demonstrated that Pt loaded on In2O3 nanooctahedra as difunctional CEs with a light scattering effect can significantly improve the Jsc and energy conversion efficiency of DSCs. The supported catalyst not only improves the utilization of Pt and reduces the cost, but also makes full use of the regular morphology of the support for light scattering. Compared with the reference DSCs using typical Pt CEs, the DSCs assembled with 0.7 wt% Pt@In2O3 CEs exhibited a remarkable 19.5% improvement in energy conversion efficiency. More importantly, this finding provides a new approach for efficiency improvement of DSCs via designing difunctional CEs with the light scattering effect.
