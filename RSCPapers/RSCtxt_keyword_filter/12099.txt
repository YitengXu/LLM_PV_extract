    , Accepted 28th July 2020First published on 5th August 2020AbstractTo effectively harvest sunlight, polymer donors with near infrared (NIR) absorption properties are important for high-performance polymer solar cells (PSCs), especially semitransparent PSCs. However, building blocks to design this kind of polymer donor are rare. In this manuscript, we report 3,11-dibromo-5,9-bis(5-(2-decyltetradecyl)thiophen-2-yl)-7,7-difluoro-7H-6λ4,7λ4-[1,3,2]diazaborinino[4,3-a:6,1-a′]diisoindole (BOPT) as a new building block to design polymer donors with NIR absorption. In BOPT, the 4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) core unit is fused with two benzene rings for a reduced bandgap and is attached with two alkylthienyl groups as conjugated side chains. We synthesized two polymers consisting of alternating BOPT units and thiophene or bithiophene units, respectively. The two polymers displayed near-infrared (NIR) light absorption with the maximum absorption peaks at wavelengths exceeding 800 nm and small bandgaps of ca. 1.3 eV. They showed high highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of about −5.0 eV/−3.5 eV and high hole mobilities of ca. 3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. PSC devices using the two polymers as electron donors exhibited power conversion efficiencies of 2.6%. These results indicate that BOPT is a promising building block in designing polymer donors with near-infrared absorption for organic photovoltaics.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to the advantages of low cost, light weight and large-area manufacturing.1–10 The active layers of PSCs consist of blends of polymer/organic electron donors and electron acceptors. To efficiently convert solar energy into electricity, the materials in the active layers of PSCs should have strong sunlight absorption capability, i.e. absorb both visible light and near-infrared (NIR) light.11–15 In particular, semitransparent PSCs, which mainly absorb NIR light and leave a transparency window in the visible range, have recently received great attention because of their photovoltaic glass applications.16–22 Therefore, it is important to develop polymer donors with NIR absorption properties. Most polymer donors have relatively large bandgaps and absorb light mainly in the visible range. Polymer donors with narrow bandgaps and absorption spectra mainly in the NIR region are rare.
The general strategy to design polymer donors is to use alternating electron-donating units (D) and electron-accepting units (A) for D–A type conjugated polymers.23,24 Typical D units include cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT),25 4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTS),26 4H-germolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTG),27 dithienopicenocarbazole (DTPC),28 benzodithiophene (BDT),29 oligothiophene,30 dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyran (DTP),31 indacenodithiophene (IDT),32 dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DBD),33 dithienopyrrole,34 carbazole,35etc., and typical A units include diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP),36 isoindigo (IID),37 benzothiadiazole (BT),38 pyridyl[2,1,3]thiadiazole (PT),39 thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD),40 naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]-thiadiazole (NT),41 3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate (TT),42 naphthalene diimide (NDI),43 benzobisthiazole (BBTz),44 quinoxaline (QX),45 thiazolothiazole (TTz),46etc. Based on these units, a very large family of polymer donors has been reported, while only a few of them exhibit NIR absorption.47,48 4-Difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) is a new type of dye molecule with an adjustable absorption spectrum, a large absorption coefficient and high fluorescence quantum yields.49–59 BODIPY has been used as a building block to design polymer donors for PSCs. However, these BODIPY-based polymer donors always exhibit absorption spectra mainly in the visible range.5,60–66
In this manuscript, we report a new BODIPY building block, dibromo-5,9-bis(5-(2-decyltetradecyl)thiophen-2-yl)-7,7-difluoro-7H-6λ4,7λ4-[1,3,2]diazaborinino[4,3-a:6,1-a′]diisoindole (BOPT), to design polymer donors with NIR absorption. The chemical structure of the BOPT unit is shown in Scheme 1a. To reduce the bandgap for NIR absorption, we fused two benzene rings on the BODIPY unit to expand π-conjugation. Most high-performance polymer donors are two-dimensional polymers with conjugated side chains.66–69 We adopted the “conjugated side chain” strategy and introduced two alkylthienyl groups to the BODIPY unit to design two-dimensional polymer donors. By copolymerizing the BOPT unit with a thiophene or bithiophene unit, we developed two polymer donors, P-T and P-2T (Scheme 1b). The two polymers exhibited NIR absorption with the absorption peaks at >800 nm and an optical bandgap of ca. 1.3 eV. PSC devices based on the two polymer donors are demonstrated. These works provide BOPT as a new building block to design polymer donors with NIR absorption properties.

Materials and synthesis
The synthetic routes of the monomer and the polymers are shown in Scheme 2. Following the literature methods, 5-(2-decyl tetradecyl)thiophene-2-carbohydrazide 4 was synthesized in four steps starting from thiophene. Imidization of 4 with 1-(4-bromo-2-hydroxyphenyl)ethan-1-one afforded 5; lead tetraacetate was used as an oxidant to further oxidize 5 to obtain the light yellow solid 6; then 6 reacted with ammonium acetate in an acidic solution to give 7. The key monomer 8 was then readily synthesized by the borylation of 7 with BF3·Et2O/Et3N as a bright blue solid. The two polymers, P-T and P-2T, were obtained via Stille polymerization with Pd2(dba)3·CHCl3/P(o-tolyl)3 as a catalyst/ligand of 8 with 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)-thiophene and 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene, respectively.
 Scheme 2  Synthetic routes of P-T and P-2T. Reagents and conditions: (i) n-Butyl lithium, tetrahydrofuran, −78 °C to 60 °C, then 11-(bromomethyl)tricosane; (ii) n-butyl lithium, diethyl ether, then dry ice, 0 °C to r.t.; (iii) thionyl chloride, methanol, 0 °C to r.t.; (iv) hydrazine monohydrate, ethanol, 80 °C; (v) 1-(4-bromo-2-hydroxyphenyl)ethan-1-one, ethanol, 85 °C; (vi) lead tetraacetate, tetrahydrofuran, 0 °C to r.t.; (vii) ammonium acetate, ethanol, acetic acid, 65 °C; (viii) triethylamine, boron trifluoride etherate, toluene, 100 °C. 
The chemical structures of P-T and P-2T were confirmed by 1H NMR and elemental analysis. According to gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as an eluent at 150 °C, the number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) were 45 kDa/3.6 for P-T and 35 kDa/3.0 for P-2T. Both the polymers showed good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform (CHCl3), chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). According to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a N2 atmosphere, the decomposition temperatures (Td) at 5% weight loss of both P-T and P-2T were higher than 330 °C, revealing good thermal stability.
Results and discussion
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level were conducted to study the structural geometries and molecular orbitals of the two polymers. We employed the model compounds containing two repeating units to perform the calculations. The long alkyl chains were replaced by methyl groups for simplified calculations. As shown in Fig. 1a, the backbones of P-T and P-2T both adopt wavy configurations. The skeleton of the BOPT unit except the pendant thienyl unit is planar. The dihedral angle between the BOPT skeleton and the pendant thienyl group is 36°, indicating an effective conjugation between them. Hence, the pendant thienyl group is expected to favor the π-stacking of polymer backbones and consequently enhance the hole mobility of the polymers. Fig. 1b shows the calculated Kohn–Sham LUMOs and HOMOs of the two model compounds. For both P-T and P-2T, the LUMOs are localized on the BOPT unit, and the HOMOs are well delocalized over both the BOPT unit and the thiophene/bithiophene unit. The calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels of P-T and P-2T are −4.59/−2.65 eV and −4.59/−2.64 eV, respectively. The thiophene/bithiophene copolymerization units do not obviously change the frontier energy levels of the polymers.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of P-T and P-2T in o-DCB solution and in thin films are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. In the solution, P-T and P-2T exhibited similar absorption spectra with the maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) at 785 nm and 781 nm, respectively. For comparison, the absorption spectrum of monomer 8 is shown in Fig. S2.† In thin films, the λmax of P-T and P-2T redshifted to 809 and 831 nm, respectively, because of the strong intermolecular interaction of the polymer chains in the solid state. From solution to thin films, the λmax redshift was larger for P-2T than for P-T, suggesting stronger intermolecular interaction of P-2T compared to P-T in thin films. Both P-T and P-2T exhibited absorption in the NIR region from 700 nm to 900 nm, indicating strong NIR light absorption capability. The optical bandgaps of P-T and P-2T were 1.33 eV and 1.31 eV, respectively.

The HOMO/LUMO energy levels of P-T and P-2T were estimated by cyclic voltammetry with their thin films spin-coated on a glassy carbon electrode. The cyclic voltammograms are shown in Fig. 3a. Both the polymers showed good oxidation/reduction behaviors. According to the onset oxidation/reduction potentials, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of P-T and P-2T were calculated to be −5.00 eV/−3.55 eV, −4.93 eV/−3.40 eV, respectively. Fig. 3b shows the energy level alignment of P-T, P-2T and a typical molecule electron acceptor 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-(((4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-sindaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (IEICO-4F). The large HOMO/LUMO energy offset provided sufficient driving force for charge separation, indicating that P-T and P-2T can be used as electron donors in PSCs.

The molecular stacking of P-T and P-2T was investigated by grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) with their thin films. The GI-XRD patterns are shown in Fig. S7.† The P-T film exhibited a weak diffraction signal, while the P-2T film showed a (100) diffraction peak at 2θ = 3.27° along with the (200) and (300) diffraction peaks. The multiple reflections suggest that P-2T adopts an ordered molecular stacking in the film state. Compared to P-T, the more ordered stacking of P-2T is due to the straighter configuration owing to the complementary bonding mode of the bithiophene unit. Moreover, the P-T and P-2T films exhibited the (010) diffraction peaks at 25.1° and 25.0°, respectively, corresponding to the π–π stacking distances of 3.54 Å for P-T and 3.56 Å for P-2T. The small π–π stacking distances of P-T and P-2T are probably beneficial for charge transport.
The hole mobilities of P-T and P-2T were determined using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with the hole-only device structure indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer/MoO3/Ag. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the hole-only device are shown in Fig. S8.† The hole mobilities of P-T and P-2T were estimated to be 2.57 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.83 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. These values are high compared to the hole mobilities of typical polymer donors and the electron mobilities of typical electron acceptors. The high hole mobilities may be attributed to the close stacking of polymer backbones and the pendant thienyl groups.
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the two polymers, we used P-T or P-2T as the polymer donor and IEICO-4F as the electron acceptor to fabricate PSC devices. The device configuration is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al. The active layers were spin-coated with a blend solution of P-T or P-2T and IEICO-4F in o-DCB at 120 °C. The J–V curves and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 4. The corresponding device parameters are presented in Table 2. The device of P-T:IEICO-4F exhibited a PCE of 2.59%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.51 V, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 9.39 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 54.06%. The device of P-2T:IEICO-4F exhibited a PCE of 2.62%, with a VOC of 0.48 V, a JSC of 10.35 mA cm−2, and an FF of 52.83%. These preliminary device performances indicate that the two BOPT-based polymers can work as polymer electron donors in PSCs. The EQE spectra of both P-T:IEICO-4F and P-2T:IEICO-4F show photoresponses in a wide range from 300 nm to 1000 nm with the maximum value of 36% at 860 nm for P-T:IEICO-4F and the maximum value of 39% at 870 nm for P-2T:IEICO-4F. The EQE responses of the two devices in the near-infrared region are higher than those in the visible region. The integrated JSC values from the EQE spectra are in good agreement with the JSC values of responsive polymer photovoltaic materials.

The dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) of the two devices was measured to evaluate the charge generation and collection efficiencies. As shown in Fig. S11,† for both devices, Jph continues to increase with increasing Veff, and is not fully saturated even at high Veff. The value of Jph,SC/Jph,sat can be used to estimate the charge collection efficiency of the device, where Jph,SC is the Jph under short-circuit conditions, Jph,sat is the Jph at saturation, and Jph at 5 V is regarded as Jph,sat. The Jph,SC/Jph,sat values for P-T:IEICO-4F and P-2T:IEICO-4F based devices were 0.69 and 0.76, respectively. These results suggest that the charge collection was inefficient in both devices. The charge recombination behaviors of the two devices were investigated by light-intensity dependence measurements. JSC showed a power exponential dependence on the light intensity (P) and could be expressed as JSC ∝ Pα, where α is the calculated power-law exponent. α should be close to 1 as the bimolecular recombination of charge carriers is negligible, while α < 1 means the presence of bimolecular recombination. The α values for the P-T-based device and the P-2T-based device were 0.95 and 0.94, respectively, suggesting that both devices exhibit a certain degree of bimolecular recombination. The inefficient charge collection and the presence of bimolecular recombination may lead to low JSC and FF of the two devices.
The active layer morphologies of P-T:IEICO-4F and P-2T:IEICO-4F were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The AFM height images of the two blend films are shown in Fig. 5a and c. The surfaces of both P-T:IEICO-4F and P-2T:IEICO-4F blend films exhibited lots of large-sized aggregates with a high root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 5.28 nm for the P-T:IEICO-4F blend film and 5.15 nm for the P-2T:IEICO-4F blend film. The large phase separation can result in ineffective charge separation and transport in the active layers, which may lead to the moderate performance of the two devices.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have designed a new benzo[a]-fused BODIPY derivative (BOPT unit) with thiophene side groups for developing polymer donor materials with near infrared absorption. Two donor polymers P-T and P-2T were obtained with alternating BOPT units and thiophene/bithiophene units. Both polymers exhibited near infrared absorption spectra with the maximum absorption peak at wavelengths exceeding 800 nm and small optical bandgaps of about 1.30 eV. An organic solar cell using P-T or P-2T as the polymer donor showed a PCE of 2.6% with the near-infrared response up to 1000 nm. These preliminary results confirm that BODIPY derivatives are promising building blocks to design near infrared absorption polymer materials for organic photovoltaics.
