    , Accepted 8th September 2020First published on 16th September 2020AbstractPhotoexcited carrier dynamics at the interface play a vital role in two-dimensional heterostructure-based photovoltaic and photoelectric devices. This study systematically investigates how the interface morphologies (i.e., alloy and sharp interfaces) control the photogenerated carrier transfer and electron–hole recombination processes in MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructures. It is revealed that both interfaces exhibit a remarkable photogenerated carrier separation rate within a few picoseconds. More surprisingly, the sharp interface exhibits an exceptional long carrier lifetime up to 1 nanosecond, which is longer than that of the alloy interface by a factor of 1.5. This is ultimately attributed to the vanishing interface-coupled states that effectively limit the transition channel and suppress the electron–hole recombination. This study provides insights into the photogenerated carrier dynamics in heterostructure interfaces and sheds light on the rational design of high-performance transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructure-based photovoltaic and photoelectric devices.
Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been extensively studied since 2010 due to their non-trivial physical and chemical properties.1–8 However, the Achilles' heel of single-layer TMDs is their large exciton binding energies ranging from 0.5 to 1.1 eV.9–14 This seriously hinders the formation of free carriers in TMDs, which leads to short photogenerated carrier lifetime, and eventually prevents their practical application in photovoltaic and photoelectric devices. To promote their optoelectronic performance, vertically-stacked TMD heterostructures have attracted widespread attention because their type-II band alignment at the heterointerface can effectively facilitate the photogenerated carrier separation and suppress the electron–hole (e–h) recombination.15–20 Nevertheless, vertical heterostructures have generally weak van der Waals interactions and suffer shortcomings such as interface contamination, uncontrolled stacking orientation, and spatial inhomogeneity.21,22 Different from vertical heterostructures, lateral heterostructures normally possess better stability in a chemical environment since their interfaces are formed via covalent bonding. More importantly, lateral heterostructures present excellent current rectification behavior and photocurrent generation characteristics, enriching the electronic and optical properties of the 2D heterostructure family.23
Since the first successful synthesis of MoS2/MoSe2 and WS2/WSe2 lateral heterostructures in 2014,23 a series of TMD lateral heterostructures including MoS2/WS2,21,24–26 MoSe2/WSe2,27,28 WSe2/MoS2,29,30 MoSe2/WS2,31 multi-junction lateral heterostructures (e.g. WS2/WSe2/MoS2 and WS2/MoSe2/WSe2) and even superlattices (WS2/WSe2/WS2/WSe2)31–33 have been reported. These heterostructures exhibit various interface morphologies, depending on the experimental conditions and synthesis techniques. Generally, one-pot synthesis methods always bring about defects or alloy interfaces, while sequential epitaxial growth methods (e.g. chemical vapor deposition) can produce atomically sharp interfaces in the junction region.28–31 This has drawn enormous attention since controlling the interface morphologies of these lateral heterostructures provides a good way to tune the photoexcited carrier transport properties and improve the device performance, as well as render devices with novel functions. For instance, Gutierrez and colleagues revealed that a MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructure exhibited strong photoluminescence at the alloy interface region, but it disappeared at the sharp interface region.28 WSe2/MoS2 lateral heterostructures with atomically sharp interface were successfully fabricated and displayed an unexpected solar energy conversion efficiency of 2.56% under sunlight spectrum (AM 1.5 G) illumination.30 Recently, MoS2/MoSe2 lateral heterostructures were prepared and had type-I band alignment, resulting in the exciton transfer from MoS2 to MoSe2 within several tens of picoseconds and a transfer velocity of up to 104 m s−1.34 Enlightened by the fabrication of various TMD lateral heterostructure devices in experiment, relevant theoretical studies have also been performed.35–39 For example, MoX2/WX2 (X = S, Se, or Te) lateral heterostructures were found to possess type-II band alignment with spontaneous e–h separation.35 The optoelectronic properties of MoX2/WX2 lateral heterostructures could be tuned by utilizing the tensile strain and the theoretical power conversion efficiency was up to ∼23% under the 4% uniaxial strain.38 Despite this great progress, how the interface morphology affects the electronic structure, band alignment and photogenerated carrier dynamics behavior of TMD lateral heterostructures is still unclear. Furthermore, the in-depth mechanism remains to be revealed.
Herein, by employing density functional theory and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, we explore the influence of the interface morphology on photogenerated charge separation and e–h recombination dynamics processes by taking MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructures with different interfaces as examples. It is found that the photogenerated carriers can effectively separate across the interface within a few picoseconds and the interface morphology has no obvious effect on the charge separation rate, arising from their similar band offset and donor–acceptor state interaction. In contrast, the sharp interface can prolong the e–h recombination lifetime with a time scale up to 1 nanosecond, which is longer than that of an alloy interface by a factor of 1.5. Such long e–h recombination lifetime is attributed to the disappearance of interface-coupled states in the sharp interface, which weakens the electron–phonon interaction and the non-adiabatic coupling, and effectively suppresses the e–h recombination.
Results and discussion
The crystal structures of MoSe2 and WSe2 unit cells are presented in Fig. 1a. The calculated lattice constants are 3.316 Å and 3.318 Å for the MoSe2 and WSe2 unit cells, respectively, with a tiny lattice mismatch (0.06%), showing excellent agreement with previous works.40,41 For lateral heterostructures with a supercell model, the band alignment would sensitively rely on the lateral length.42,43 This means that their band alignment would reach the Anderson limit only when the lateral length is sufficiently wide.42 Otherwise, the band alignment is ambiguous. Here, we used a sufficiently large supercell (9 × 3) to model the MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructures with alloy and sharp interfaces, as shown in Fig. 1b. A total of 79 alloy models maintaining Mo0.5W0.5Se2 stoichiometry were constructed to simulate fully alloy interfaces by swapping a pair of metal atoms between two sides, as shown in Fig. 1c. To determine the appropriate alloy interface structure, the relative formation energies (Ef) of these models were calculated and are listed in Table S1† using the formula:44Ef = (Ealloy − Esharp)/2, where Ealloy and Esharp represent the total energies of the corresponding alloy and sharp interfaces, respectively, and 2 is the number of alloy/sharp interfaces in the supercell model. The most stable configuration with the minimum relative formation energy of −0.0195 eV is shown in Fig. 1c, based on which the alloy interface is modeled in our following discussion. Note that the calculated relative formation energy is very small, which implies that the interface seems to be uncontrollable during experiments. This can be attributed to the fact that the constructed alloy interface region is narrow in our supercell model (Fig. 1b). Actually, an alloy interface with a width of several nanometers or more was observed in experiments.27 Such a wide interface region will increase the disorder of atom diffusion and reduce the total energy of the alloy interface, thus obtaining a larger relative formation energy. However, constructing an interface model completely consistent with the experimental results will involve thousands of atoms, which is difficult to carry out first-principle calculations on due to their expensive computational cost. Even so, our calculated results still qualitatively show the energy relationship between the alloy and sharp interface. In addition, we calculated the entropy of alloy interface configurations with the minimum Ef and the second minimum Ef to justify the entropic effect on interface configurations. As listed in Table S2,† the entropy for both interface configurations are −15.428 eV and −15.425 eV, respectively, that is, their energy difference is only 0.003 eV, which is smaller than the total energy difference (0.012 eV) between these two interface configurations (see Table S2†). Such small entropy difference cannot overcome the energy needed for an interface change, indicating that the most stable configuration will not change even if the entropic effect is included.

A total of 79 interfacial configurations are constructed in the right panel and the minimum energy configuration is marked by a red dotted box in the left panel. The pink and gray spheres in the right panel represent Mo and W atoms, respectively. 
To qualitatively analyze the effect of interface morphology on the charge transfer dynamics of MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructures, we calculated the local density of states (LDOS) of MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructures with alloy and sharp interfaces, as shown in Fig. 2. Type-II band alignments are observed in both interface structures, and the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) offsets are both around 0.15 eV, which provides the driving force for the charge separation. Notably, the electronic states from the alloy interface contribute to the band edges but do not modify their position. Therefore, the band gaps of the two systems are of similar magnitude with a tiny difference of 0.02 eV. Such a similar magnitude of band gap, CBM offset and VBM offset for both interfaces are expected to introduce a comparable energy difference between the donor and acceptor states. Therefore, the influence of the donor–acceptor energy difference is excluded from explaining the different charge transfer behaviors of these two interfaces. Besides, we observe that the LDOS of interface-coupled states is larger than that of MoSe2 or WSe2, which can be attributed to the localized charge distribution in the alloy interface region. As a result, the number of states within a given energy range of a band of the former is more than that of the latter.

Filled and empty curves represent occupied and unoccupied states, respectively. The dotted line represents the Fermi level. Green line: states contributed by alloy interface; blue line: states contributed by WSe2; red line: states contributed by MoSe2. The CBM of WSe2 (WSe2@CBM) and CBM of MoSe2 (MoSe2@CBM) in two interfaces are the electron donor and acceptor states, respectively. The VBM of MoSe2 (MoSe2@VBM) and VBM of WSe2 (WSe2@VBM) in two interfaces are the hole donor and acceptor states, respectively. The interface-coupled states (ICS) refer to the states contributed to by the alloy interface, which is strongly coupled with the band-edges of the monolayer (MoSe2@CBM and WSe2@VBM). 
Generally, the wave function overlap between donor and acceptor states contributes to the non-adiabatic electron–phonon (e–p) coupling and affects charge transfer dynamics.45,46 Here, we calculated the real space charge density distribution of the key electronic states participating in the charge transfer processes, as presented in Fig. 3. We notice that the donor states of the electron (WSe2@CBM) and hole (MoSe2@VBM) are mainly contributed to by WSe2 and MoSe2 in the two interface structures. In contrast, the acceptor states of the electron (MoSe2@CBM) and hole (WSe2@VBM) in the alloy interface system are delocalized on both MoSe2 (WSe2) and the interface region, but it is only localized on their corresponding counterpart in the sharp interface system. Consequently, we infer that it is the interface-coupled states that enhance the spatial overlap of the donor–acceptor states in the alloy interface system, which would facilitate both the electron and hole transfer to the interface region and accelerate e–h recombination. While for the sharp interface system, no interface-coupled states exist, which greatly restricts the photogenerated charge transfer dynamics processes. To make a comparison, we also provide the total density of states (TDOS) and charge density distribution of the VBM and CBM of the MoSe2 monolayer in Fig. 2 and 3. Both the VBM and CBM distribute uniformly over the whole MoSe2 monolayer since all atoms lie in the same chemical condition, which results in a fully spatial overlap of the donor–acceptor states. Such delocalized charge density distribution would possibly prevent the e–h separation and lead to the fast e–h recombination.

The red and blue arrows represent the hole and electron transfer processes, respectively. The isosurface value was set to 0.0012 e bohr−3. 
We note that the calculated relative formation energies of the 79 alloy interface configurations are comparable (see Table S1 of ESI†), which means that the realistic system would be composed of a more diverse set of configurations. To justify the influence of interface configurations on electronic structures, we calculated the LDOS and charge density of the other two interface configurations with the maximum and medium relative formation energy, as shown in Fig. S1 and S2 of the ESI.† It can be seen that both the LDOS and charge densities of the band-edge states of the maximum and medium energy configurations are similar to that of the minimum energy configuration (Fig. 2a and 3a), suggesting that the influence of different alloy interface configurations on the subsequent non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) calculation is small.
NAMD simulations were performed to gain more straightforward insight into the interface charge transfer dynamics. Fig. 4 shows the time evolution for the population of electrons and holes in MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructures with alloy and sharp interfaces. To assess the error bar of calculated dynamics processes, the time-domain population calculations were repeated three times using the same setting (see Fig. S3†). We find that there is negligible variation between these repetitive results, indicating a tiny error associated with the NAMD calculations. The time constants τ were obtained by fitting the data to the exponential function, f(t) = exp(−t/τ). It can be seen that the picosecond-scale photoexcited carrier separation processes occur in the alloy interface system (3.5–3.8 ps), which is faster than that in the sharp interface system (3.8–5.6 ps). Such a few picosecond-scale in the two interface systems is close to the few tens of picoseconds of exciton transfer in MoSe2/MoS2 lateral hetero-structures,34 confirming the reliability of our results. The faster charge transfer in the alloy interface system can be rationalized by the larger overlap of donor–acceptor wave function as compared with that in the sharp interface system, which leads to a stronger donor–acceptor interaction (see Fig. 3a). The underlying physics can be revealed by examining the non-adiabatic coupling (NAC), which arises from the dependence of the adiabatic orbitals on the nuclear coordinates. The NAC was computed numerically as the overlap between adiabatic orbitals at sequential time steps, defined as: (1)here, H is the Kohn–Sham Hamiltonian, φ and ε are the wave function and eigenvalue, respectively, Ṙ is the velocity of nucleus, and k and j represent different electronic states.47,48 The NAC describes the phonon mediated coupling of the electronic states. Larger NAC means faster charge transfer. The NAC values of the electron (hole) transfer in the alloy and sharp interface system are 1.31 (0.98) meV and 0.96 (0.59) meV, respectively, indicating that electron transfer is faster than hole transfer in both interface systems. According to eqn (1), the NAC depends on the e–p coupling term 〈φj|∇RH|φk〉, nuclear velocity Ṙ, and the energy difference εk − εj. Based on the above discussions (see Fig. 2), the effect of energy differences between the donor and acceptor states on the charge transfer processes can be ignored due to their similar magnitude in both systems. Therefore, we conclude that the e–p coupling term and nuclear velocity assisted by phonon modes may play a vital role in determining the charge transfer rate.

To identify the phonon modes participating in the photo-generated carrier transfer processes, Fourier transforms of the energy gaps between the donor and acceptor states were calculated and are shown in Fig. 5. We also calculated the vibration types of these modes to justify their attribution, as shown in Fig. S4.† In Fig. 5a, the dominant vibration mode around 400 cm−1 for the alloy interface system could be attributed to the out-of-plane mode at 387.51 cm−1 of the MoSe2 region, which results in a faster nuclear velocity Ṙ. The side peaks at around 143.47 cm−1 and 200 cm−1 can be assigned to the in-plane modes of the alloy interface region. Moreover, a series of high-frequency vibration modes ranging from 600 cm−1 to 800 cm−1 also participate in the electron transfer and greatly enhance the e–p coupling. More fast high-frequency modes contribute to the large NAC value and accelerate the electron transfer for the alloy interface system. Similar phenomena also appear in the hole transfer process. The dominant peak at 41.22 cm−1 and 40.23 cm−1 can be assigned to the in-plane modes of MoSe2 and WSe2,49 as well as alloy interface regions (see Fig. S4†). It is surprising that although the alloy interface facilitates the charge transfer, the time scale difference between these two interface systems is very small. Thus, the electron and hole transfer shows no obvious enhancement via introducing interface-coupled states. In other words, the interface morphology has no significant role in accelerating the photogenerated carrier transfer rate in the MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructure.

In addition to photogenerated electron and hole transfer, e–h recombination is another vital process influencing the performance of optoelectronic devices. Fig. 4c shows the e–h recombination dynamics of the MoSe2 monolayer and MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructures with two different interfaces. The calculated NAC of e–h recombination for MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructures with alloy and sharp interfaces are listed in Table 1. The calculated e–h recombination lifetime for the alloy and sharp interface system is up to 680 ps and 1077 ps, respectively, which is significantly longer than that of the pristine MoSe2 (338 ps) monolayer and WSe2 (405 ps)50 monolayer, demonstrating that the MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructure can effectively suppress the e–h recombination. Similar to the charge transfer process, the contribution of the energy difference εk − εj is excluded from understanding the discrepancy of the e–h recombination lifetime due to their similar magnitude. Therefore we further examined the influence of e–p coupling 〈φj|∇RH|φk〉 and nuclear velocity Ṙ on the NAC.

As discussed above, phonon modes play an important role in the NAC value of the e–h recombination process by affecting the e–p coupling and nuclear velocity. In Fig. 5c, the dominant peak at around 40 cm−1 in the two interface systems can be attributed to the in-plane modes of MoSe2, WSe2 and the alloy interface region (see Fig. S4†). This low-frequency mode induces slow nuclear velocity, which greatly reduces the NAC and suppresses the e–h recombination. Nevertheless, some weak high-frequency phonon modes, attributed to the Mo0.5W0.5Se2 alloy region, also appear in the alloy interface system. Such high-frequency modes would enhance the e–p coupling and nuclear velocity, then increase the NAC value. Based on the above discussions, we conclude that the interface-coupled states formed in the alloy interface system strongly enhance the e–p interaction in e–h recombination processes, which increases the NAC value and eventually shrinks the photogenerated carrier lifetime. In addition, compared with the MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructure, the dominant peak around 200 cm−1, attributed to the out-of-plane A1g mode,51 as well as high-frequency vibration modes of the MoSe2 monolayer results in its largest NAC value and fastest e–h recombination dynamics process (see Fig. 4c). That is why the single-layer TMDs always exhibit a shorter photoexcited carrier lifetime than that of their heterostructures.
To the best of our knowledge, the e–h recombination process depends not only on the non-radiative coupling but also on the pure-dephasing (decoherence) time since the quantum decoherence takes place on the time scale of a few femtoseconds, which is much faster than the quantum transition.52,53 Note that the decoherence can be ignored during the rapid relaxation along the quasi-continuous manifold of excited electronic states in nanoscale systems while it plays an important role in slow e–h recombination across the band gap since the quantum-classical method will overestimate the recombination time. Therefore, we focus on discussing the effect of decoherence on electron–hole recombination dynamics instead of charge transfer dynamics. Generally speaking, longer decoherence time means a faster e–h recombination process. The pure-dephasing time is calculated based on the optical response theory,54 as depicted in Fig. 5d. The time constant of decoherence is fitted using the Gaussian expression, f(t) = exp(−0.5(t/τ)2), as listed in Table 1. The pure-dephasing time of the alloy interface system is 11.4 fs. This value is attributed to the strong low-frequency acoustic phonon mode at 40 cm−1 and weak high-frequency optical phonon mode around 400 cm−1, which couple with the electrons from MoSe2@CBM to WSe2@VBM and give rise to the elastic e–p scattering. While in the sharp interface, the pure-dephasing time is extended to 14.8 fs. The increased pure-dephasing time can be understood by the decrease of optical phonon modes, which slightly suppresses the elastic e–p scattering. The pure-dephasing time of the MoSe2 monolayer is slower than that of MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructures with two different interfaces. This can be attributed to the larger atomic motion in heterostructure systems induced by their complex low-frequency in-plane mode around 40 cm−1.55 One should notice that although the pure-dephasing time of the sharp interface is longer than that of the alloy interface, the former still has a longer e–h recombination lifetime than that of the latter. This is because the e–h recombination lifetime is determined by the synergism between non-adiabatic coupling and pure-dephasing time. As shown in Table 1, the NAC value of the sharp interface system is smaller than that of the alloy interface system by a factor of 2 while their pure-dephasing times are very close. As a result, the tiny NAC in the sharp interface beats the pure-dephasing time and suppresses the e–h recombination lifetime eventually. Even so, the largest NAC value and the longest pure-dephasing time of the MoSe2 monolayer determine that the fast e–h recombination process for the two counterpart monolayers in the lateral heterostructures is inevitable.
As mentioned above, the 79 alloy interface configurations have comparable relative formation energies. This means that they are all possible in reality. To further investigate the role of alloy interface configurations on the NAMD calculations, we also calculated the population of carrier transfer and e–h recombination dynamics of the two alloy interface configurations with the medium and maximum relative formation energy, as shown in Fig. S5.† The different alloy interface configurations have very close carrier transfer times (time variation of 0.2 ps and 0.3 ps for electron transfer and hole transfer, respectively), indicating that the influence on the carrier transfer dynamics is small. Moreover, although the e–h recombination lifetimes show dependence on the alloy interface configurations (680, 750 and 825 ps for minimum, medium and maximum energy configurations, respectively), they all are still lower than that of the sharp interface (1077 ps).
In the NAMD calculations, the NAC is computed using the overlap between two electronic wave functions at adjacent ionic time steps along the MD trajectory.56 However, the wave functions along the nuclear trajectories may be inconsistent in their phases, which will dramatically affect the NAC and make the NAMD results inaccurate.57 Therefore, we also considered the phase correction in our calculation to discuss the effect of phase inconsistency on the dynamics of MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructures, as shown in Fig. S6.† Overall, considering the phase correction suppresses the dynamics of carrier transfer and e–h recombination. However, it does not lead to the qualitative change in e–h recombination lifetime. The calculated e–h recombination lifetime of the sharp interface (1140 ps) is 1.36 times longer than that of the alloy interface (835 ps) by considering the phase correction, which is close to that (1.5 times) without considering the phase correction. Therefore, we infer that considering phase correction quantitatively would prolong the time scale but it would not change our main conclusion.
Conclusions
In summary, we systematically studied the influence of interface morphology on the photogenerated carrier dynamics of MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructures based on DFT and NAMD calculations. It is revealed that the photogenerated carriers can effectively separate across the interface because of the type-II band alignment. Nevertheless, the interface morphology has no obvious effect on the charge separation rate and the time scale difference is only a few picoseconds, arising from their similar band offset and donor–acceptor state interaction. Very strikingly, the sharp interface can effectively prolong the photogenerated electron–hole recombination lifetime to 1 ns, which is 1.5 and 3.2 times longer than that of the alloy interface system and MoSe2 monolayer. This nanoseconds e–h recombination lifetime in the sharp interface can be rationalized by two factors: (i) the absent interface-coupled states reduce the wave function overlap of CBM and VBM and thus weaken the donor–acceptor interaction remarkably. (ii) The tiny NAC value in the sharp interface surpasses the pure-phasing time and suppresses the e–h recombination. Therefore, fabricating sharp interfaces instead of alloy interfaces would facilitate the better optoelectronic performance for TMD lateral heterostructures. Our study suggests that the interface-coupled state's engineering can effectively modulate the photoexcited carrier lifetime and provide a feasible route to improve the performance of optoelectronic devices based on TMD lateral heterostructures.
Computational methods
The geometry optimization, electronic structures and adiabatic molecular dynamics were implemented based on the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).58,59 The electron exchange–correlation interaction was treated with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) in the framework of generalized gradient approximation (GGA).60 The projected augmented wave (PAW) method was used to treat the interaction between ionic nuclei and valence electrons.61,62 A kinetic cutoff of 500 eV and k-point meshes of 5 × 5 × 1 were adopted for geometry optimization and electronic structure calculations. The lattice constants and atomic positions were fully relaxed until the atomic forces were smaller than 0.02 eV Å−1 and electron relaxation convergence criterion was 10−4 eV. A 20 Å vacuum region was chosen to screen the interaction between two neighboring periodic boxes. The entropy was calculated from the vibrational frequencies by the following equation: (2)where h, ν, KB and T are the Planck constant, vibrational frequencies, Boltzmann constant and temperature, respectively. In addition, the dipole and dispersion corrections were considered in energy and electron structure calculations and the influence of them can be ignored (see Table S2 and Fig. S7†).
All non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) calculations were implemented in the PYXAID code,63,64 based on time-domain density functional theory. The decoherence-induced surface hopping (DISH) method was considered.54 Considering ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) and NAC calculations are very time-consuming, a 1 × 1 × 1 k-point mesh was adopted. To run NAMD calculations, we needed to obtain the adiabatic MD trajectory. The temperature of model was first kept at 300 K over 4 ps in the canonical ensemble (NVT).65 After that, a 5 ps ab initio MD (AIMD) was calculated in the microcanonical ensemble (NVE) with a 1 fs nuclear time step, and the non-adiabatic coupling (NAC) elements were obtained from the AIMD trajectories. The effects of different initial configurations and surface hopping trajectories on NAND were tested and are shown in the ESI (Fig. S9†). 200 initial configurations were selected randomly in the first 1 ps AIMD trajectories and 1000 surface hopping trajectories were adopted for each chosen initial structure. Then, 4 ps NAMD simulations were performed for the electron/hole separation and recombination dynamics respectively. In addition, 12 states were included in active space in NAMD calculations, as listed in the ESI (see Fig. S10†). We should point out that although the excitonic effect is known to be significant in 2D materials, it was not considered in our NAMD calculations because of the limitation of the current Pyxaid package.66–68

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Top view of the fully optimized structures of (a) MoSe2 (WSe2) and (b) MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructures with alloy and sharp interface. The shadow frames represent the alloy interface region. (c) Geometric structures of alloy interface models with a stoichiometry of Mo0.5W0.5Se2. A total of 79 interfacial configurations are constructed in the right panel and the minimum energy configuration is marked by a red dotted box in the left panel. The pink and gray spheres in the right panel represent Mo and W atoms, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 2  LDOS of MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructure with (a) alloy interface and (b) sharp interface. (c) TDOS of pristine MoSe2 monolayer. Filled and empty curves represent occupied and unoccupied states, respectively. The dotted line represents the Fermi level. Green line: states contributed by alloy interface; blue line: states contributed by WSe2; red line: states contributed by MoSe2. The CBM of WSe2 (WSe2@CBM) and CBM of MoSe2 (MoSe2@CBM) in two interfaces are the electron donor and acceptor states, respectively. The VBM of MoSe2 (MoSe2@VBM) and VBM of WSe2 (WSe2@VBM) in two interfaces are the hole donor and acceptor states, respectively. The interface-coupled states (ICS) refer to the states contributed to by the alloy interface, which is strongly coupled with the band-edges of the monolayer (MoSe2@CBM and WSe2@VBM).	 

 	Fig. 3  Charge densities of the band-edge states of MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructures with (a) alloy interface, (b) sharp interface and (c) pristine MoSe2 monolayer. The red and blue arrows represent the hole and electron transfer processes, respectively. The isosurface value was set to 0.0012 e bohr−3.	 
	(1)

 	Fig. 4  (a) Electron transfer, (b) hole transfer and (c) e–h recombination dynamics of MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructures with alloy and sharp interface. The blue line in panel (c) represents e–h recombination dynamics of the pristine MoSe2 monolayer. The data are fitted by f(t) = exp(−t/τ). (d) Schematic diagram of key photogenerated carrier transfer processes in MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructures with alloy and sharp interface. ICS represents the interface-coupled states.	 

 	Fig. 5  Calculated Fourier transform spectra of energy gaps between the donor and acceptor states for (a) electron transfer, (b) hole transfer and (c) e–h recombination in MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructures with two different interfaces. (d) Pure-dephasing functions of the MoSe2 monolayer and MoSe2/WSe2 lateral heterostructures with alloy and sharp interface. The data are fitted by f(t) = exp(−0.5(t/τ)2) respectively.
