    , Accepted 5th January 2017First published on 6th January 2017AbstractTwo novel water-soluble π-conjugated small molecules based on dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide and bispyridinium salts, named FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl, were successfully synthesized. Both molecules showed deep blue light emission, with photoluminescence peaks at about 408 and 405 nm in aqueous solution, respectively. Their photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) in aqueous solution were as high as 68.9% and 50.3%, respectively. Electrochemical measurements suggested that they have excellent electron affinity, with lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels at −3.78 and −3.94 eV, respectively. Due to their unique properties including large planarity, good thermal stability, excellent electron affinity and high fluorescence efficiency, FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl may be promising construction units for preparing water/alcohol-soluble conjugated materials with good optoelectronic performance.
Introduction
Conjugated organic materials, including organic small molecules and polymers, are a class of materials which contain a backbone with delocalized electronic structure. Their structurally controllable properties including light absorption, light emission, charge transport, conductivity, and chemical sensitivity endow them with great application potential in optoelectronic devices, such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),1,2 organic photovoltaics (OPVs),3–5 organic field effect transistors (OFETs),6,7 electrochromic devices8,9 and chemo- and bio- sensors.10–13
Among these materials, water/alcohol-soluble conjugated small molecules and polymers have drawn increasing attention in organic electronics in recent years, resulting from their versatile optoelectronic properties and unique solubility. Generally, this class of materials is characterized by a π-conjugated backbone and surfactant-like functional group (amino,14,15 phosphate,16 hydroxy,17 quaternary ammonium,18 sulfonic groups,19etc.). The π-conjugated backbone determines the intrinsic optoelectronic properties (such as absorption and emission spectra, charge transporting abilities and energy-band structures), while the surfactant-like group provides unique solubility in highly polar solvents (such as water, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and alcohol). Such significant traits make them extremely useful in optoelectronic devices, including OLEDs,20,21 OPVs,22,23 sensors,24,25etc. For example, Cao and co-workers have developed an alcohol-soluble conjugated polymer named poly[(9,9-bis(3-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) as an electron-injection layer for polymer LEDs.26 They found that the enhancement of device performance using a PFN/Al cathode could be comparable with that using a Ba/Al cathode. This phenomenon was explained by the formation of an interface dipole between the amino groups in PFN and metal cathode. Until now, PFN has been widely used as a cathode modification material and greatly promoted the development of both OLEDs20,27,28 and OPVs.29–31 Su et al. have synthesized a family of conjugated small molecules based on triphenylamine and fluorene with phosphonate side chains, as efficient electron-injecting and transporting layers.32 Due to the versatile alcohol solubility of these materials, multilayer polymer LEDs and OPVs were successfully fabricated by solution-processing techniques from orthogonal solvents without interfacial mixing. Ma et al. also have designed a new electron-transporting small molecule named 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-dicarboxylic acid.33 The carboxyl groups induced good solubility in polar solvents, which helped to achieve large-scale solution-processing techniques. When it was used as a cathode modification layer in inverted OPVs based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):[6, 6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) blends, the anchoring effect of carboxyl groups on ZnO (or ITO) could improve interfacial contact between the ZnO (or ITO) substrate and active layer, so as to enhance the device performance. Cao and co-workers have utilized a water-soluble polyelectrolyte, poly(9,9-bis(4′-sulfonatobutyl)fluorene-co-alt-1,4-phenylene) sodium salt (PFS), as a sensor for detecting avidin.34 It was found that the photoluminescence of PFS could be quenched by a biotin-labelled dye (Lucifer yellow cadaverine biotin-X dipotassium salt) only in the presence of avidin, and the detecting sensitivity for avidin was as high as sub-nano molar (1 × 10−10 M).
In the past decades, pyridinium derivatives have been extensively used as electrochromic materials,35,36 sensors,37,38 cathode interfacial materials,39 solvatochromic probes,40 surfactants,41,42 CO2 reduction electrocatalysts,43,44etc., resulting from their unique optical, electrochemical, electron-deficient and water/alcohol-soluble features. For instance, Kim's group have synthesized three polyviologen derivatives and utilized them as cathode interlayers in OPVs.39 They found that these polymers could reduce the work functions of metal cathodes by the formation of an interfacial dipole and improve the contact properties with cathodes, leading to the enhancement of OPV performance.
Recently, Swager's group reported a new class of water/alcohol-soluble n-type conjugated polymers based on a pyridinium-phenylene scaffold.45 Among these polymers, electron-deficient pyridinium rings were introduced by intramolecular cyclization reaction. Since these molecules showed many interesting photoelectric properties such as high electron affinity, high conductivity, good electron mobility and efficient quenching effect with donor polymers, many conjugated polymers46–49 and small molecules50 based on the pyridinium-phenylene unit were designed and synthesized soon afterwards. Some of these materials were used in sensors48,49 or OPVs,50 and displayed excellent performance. For instance, Swager and co-workers have synthesized two polymers with the pyridinium-phenylene repeat unit, which showed appealing properties such as high electron affinity, charge-transport upon n-doping and optical responses to electron-donating analytes.49 It was demonstrated that such polymers could act as optical probes for various biological analytes (indole, caffeine, etc.) in aqueous solutions. Su's group have developed a series of small molecules based on pyridinium salts.50 When they were used as cathode interlayers in OPVs, one of these molecules (with better film-forming ability) helped to increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 4.32% to 6.56%. These combined properties such as water/alcohol solubility, suitable energy levels and good electron transporting ability made them promising candidates as cathode interlayers for highly efficient OPVs.
On the other hand, dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide (FSO), as a versatile conjugated unit, has been widely used in OLEDs due to its high fluorescence efficiency, good thermal stability, large electron affinity and high electron-transporting property, regardless of its relatively low solubility.51–53 For example, King et al. have synthesized a class of random poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl)-(dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide-3,7-diyl) copolymers,54 and they found that in comparison with poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PFO), the introduction of an FSO unit into PFO backbone could facilitate electron injection from the cathode, leading to more balanced charge transport and desirable device performance. Previously, we have prepared a family of blue, green and red light-emitting polymers based on the FSO unit.55 These blue, green and red light-emitting polymers exhibited high efficiencies and good thermal stability, with maximum efficiencies of 7.0, 17.6 and 6.1 cd A−1, respectively. We also have synthesized a series of alcohol-soluble amino-functionalized polyfluorene derivatives comprising of the FSO unit in the main chains.56 When these polymers were utilized as cathode interlayers in OLEDs and OPVs, some of them exhibited higher performance compared with PFN, ascribed to the incorporation of the electron-transporting FSO segment.
In this study, two water-soluble small-molecular bispyridinium salts FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl with FSO as the core have been designed and synthesized. Considering the advantages of the FSO unit and pyridinium salts, these two molecules may have combined properties of FSO and pyridinium moieties, which mean good thermal stability, high PLQYs, large electron-withdrawing and electron-extracting ability, etc. Potentially, they can be used as good construction units of water/alcohol-soluble conjugated small molecules and polymers for chemical and bio-sensors, and cathode interfacial layers in OLEDs, OPVs and perovskite solar cells (PVSCs).

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic routes for two bispyridinium salts FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl are shown in Scheme 1. The chemical structures of all compounds were verified by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S1–S10, ESI†), APCI-MS and elemental analysis in detail. Preliminarily, compound 2 was obtained as a colorless oil by adding 1-bromo-2-methoxyethane after lithium-halogen exchange of 1 with n-BuLi at −78 °C. In a mixed solvent of concentrated H2SO4 and AcOH (3/1, v/v), 4 was successfully prepared by treating 3 with NBS at 0 °C. In order to improve the yield of 4, NBS should be added in several portions, and thin layer chromatography (TLC) analysis should be employed to monitor the reaction so as to reduce the amounts of byproducts. Then, the elimination of methyl groups in the side chains of 4 was carried out by treating with BBr3, followed by quenching with water to obtain compound 5. In order to obtain pure 5 quickly, it was noted that THF should be used as eluent to flush the chromatography column after the impurities with lower polarities were removed using ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (5/1, v/v) as eluent, since 5 has poor solubility in common organic solvents. 6 was obtained through the reaction of 5 with TBDMSCl at 0 °C in anhydrous THF. The yield of this reaction was as high as 92%, and the solubility of the product became much better than that of 5 due to the introduction of TBDMS groups. Subsequently, 7 was prepared by reacting 6 with 2-tributylstannanyl-pyridine under the general Pd-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling conditions. Furthermore, through the coupling reaction of compound 6 with bis(pinacolato)diboron, 8 was successfully yielded. The crude product of 8 was obtained by fast column chromatography on neutral Al2O3 using ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (1/1, v/v) as eluent. Note that it was difficult to obtain the exhaustively pure target product of 8 by further purification, and the further purification was accompanied by a significant loss of 8, so the crude one was only purified by fast column chromatography and used directly for the next step. Compound 9 was given by the general Pd-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between 8 and 2-bromopyrimidine. Finally, the two bispyridinium salts FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl were generated through intramolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction by treating compounds 7 and 9 with SOCl2, respectively. It is interesting to point out that FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl are only readily soluble in water, and have low solubility in highly polar organic solvents (DMSO, methanol, DMF etc.), but cannot be dissolved in relatively low polar solvents (THF, CHCl3, CH2Cl2etc.). 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S9–S10, ESI†) and elemental analysis were performed for the confirmation of structures of FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl. In the 1H NMR spectra, the signals of all the protons in the aromatic rings of FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl exhibited higher chemical shifts compared with the precursors of 7 and 9, respectively, resulting from the generation of electron-withdrawing N+ cations. The resonances at 4.83 and 3.48 ppm for FSOPyCl and those at 4.90 and 3.55 ppm for FSOmiCl corresponded to the protons in the methylene groups of the new-formed ethylene bridges. The singlet peaks at 0.84 and −0.06 ppm for 7 and those at 0.87 and −0.03 ppm for 9, which were attributed to the TBDMS groups, disappeared in the spectra of FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl. This indicated that FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl could be transformed from their precursors readily.

Thermal properties
The thermal stabilities of FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl were investigated by thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), as shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1. The scanning temperature ranged from 50 to 400 °C with an increasing rate of 10 °C min−1. Both FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl exhibited a single thermal decomposition process, with onset temperatures (Td) of about 185 and 179 °C, respectively. Although their thermal stability is relatively lower than that of the reported compounds with slightly similar structures,57,58 their stability is high enough for general optoelectronic applications. We suppose that the stability of FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl can be improved feasibly through further structure modification according.

Photophysical properties
The UV-vis absorption and PL spectra of FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl in MeOH and H2O are shown in Fig. 2, and their photophysical properties are summarized in Table 1. Both FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl showed deep blue emission. FSOPyCl exhibited intensely similar absorption profiles in MeOH and aqueous solution. The dominant absorption peaks were located at 356, 374 and 357, 374 nm in H2O and MeOH, respectively, which could be attributed to the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone. The PL spectrum of FSOPyCl in H2O showed two peaks at 389 and 408 nm, and that in MeOH exhibited peaks at 393 and 410 nm. On the other hand, FSOmiCl also exhibited similar dominant absorption bands which were located at 351 and 369 nm in both H2O and MeOH. Compared with the PL spectrum in H2O which exhibited a peak at 405 nm, the PL in MeOH showed a mild bathochromic shift with a peak at 408 nm. The slight red shift of the PL spectrum might be attributed to the much lower solubility in MeOH than H2O, and the molecules of FSOmiCl were just partially dispersed instead of being completely dissolved in MeOH, leading to intermolecular aggregation in MeOH. In H2O and MeOH, both FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl showed relatively short fluorescence lifetime values of 1–2 ns. The PLQYs of FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl in MeOH were 55.9% and 12.4%, respectively. However, FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl showed significantly higher PLQY values of 68.9% and 50.3%, respectively, in aqueous solution. The decreased PLQYs in MeOH might be due to the quenching of fluorescence caused by the intermolecular aggregation in MeOH, especially for FSOmiCl, as discussed above. Also, the varieties between these four kr/kd values accounted for the difference in the PLQY values of FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl in H2O and MeOH.

Electrochemical properties
In order to gain an insightful understanding of the electrochemical properties of FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) characterization was carried out, as shown in Fig. 3. The redox potential (E1/2) of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was recorded to be 0.48 V using an SCE as the reference electrode. Since the redox potential of Fc/Fc+ has an absolute energy level of −4.80 eV relative to the vacuum energy level, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level could be calculated according to the empirical equation (ELUMO = −e(4.8 + Ered − 0.48)), where Ered is the onset reduction potential vs. SCE in the CV curves. In Fig. 3, the Ered values of FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl are located at −0.54 and −0.38 V, respectively, and the LUMO energy levels could be calculated to be −3.78 and −3.94 eV, respectively. In the CV measurement, there is no oxidation observed for FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl, due to the lack of electron-donating units in these two compounds.45,47

Conclusions
Two water-soluble π-conjugated bispyridinium salts containing an FSO unit have been reported. Materials FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl showed deep blue emission with PL peaks at 408 and 405 nm, respectively, in aqueous solution. The PLQYs in H2O were as high as 68.9% and 50.3% for FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl, respectively. The CV test showed that both molecules have excellent electron affinity, with LUMO energy levels at −3.78 and −3.94 eV, respectively. Due to their unique properties including large planarity, good thermal stability, excellent electron affinity and high fluorescence efficiency, FSOPyCl and FSOmiCl may be promising construction units for preparing water/alcohol-soluble conjugated materials with excellent optoelectronic performance.
