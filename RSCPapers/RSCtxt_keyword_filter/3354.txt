Tumor marker detection is of great significance in early clinical diagnosis and disease prevention. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a sense protease secreted by both normal prostate glandular cells and prostate cancer cells,1 has been considered as the most reliable tumor marker for the early detection of prostate cancer and monitoring disease recurrence after treatment.2 To date, various methods and strategies have been reported for the detection of PSA, such as fluorescence,3 surface plasmon resonance,4 electrochemical5 and electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay.6 Though high sensitivity is achieved, the complex fabrication and difficult storage of the probes as well as the energy dependence limit their practical applications, particularly for on-site monitoring.
Recently, self-powered sensors have been drawing extensive interest due to the capability of detection without dispensing with external power sources, simplifying the fabrication process, minimizing the scale, and reducing the expense, and especially benefiting the miniaturization of detection devices.7 As portable power sources, biofuel cells (BFCs) are devices that directly convert chemical energy to electrical energy via bio-electrochemical reactions from renewable enzymes and fuels.8 Recently BFC-based self-powered sensors have been well demonstrated in the development of different kinds of self-powered biosensors for glucose, ethanol, fructose and so forth, because of the amplifying nature of substrate turnover as well as the specificity of biological recognition between the biocatalyst and the substance.9 Herein, a glucose-air BFC-based self-powered sensing system was established for highly sensitive detection of PSA.
In general, an electrochemical workstation is required in most conventional BFC devices to measure the weak current sensitively.10 However, such an expensive and sophisticated electrochemical workstation makes the apparatus complicated and departs from the portable and low-cost developing trend for self-powered sensors. Hence, a strategy for electrochemical workstation substitution is highly desired. In this work, an original hybrid BFC–supercapacitor system using well-aligned TiO2 nanotubes (TNTs) as electrode substrates for energy storage was constructed. With the development of nano science and technology, various nanomaterials have been introduced as electrode enhancing materials to immobilize biocatalysts and therefore enhance the performance of BFCs.10b,11 Copper-based materials that are less expensive exhibited comparable catalytic oxidation ability toward glucose.12 Cu2O, due to prominent features of narrow band gap (2.0 eV), high absorption efficiency and non-toxicity, has become a promising candidate for potential application in catalysis and biosensing.13 To achieve high activity towards glucose oxidation, uniform dispersion and controllable particle size of Cu2O nanoparticles are essential. Herein, Cu2O–TNT composites were successfully fabricated by incorporating the nano-sized Cu2O into the entire TNT framework via electrodeposition (Fig. 1A and B, details in the ESI†). The synergy between TNTs and Cu2O nanoparticles led to an enhanced oxidation performance to glucose. In the cathode, bilirubin oxidase (BOD) was immobilized on AuNP-modified TNTs (Au–TNTs) (Fig. 1C, details in the ESI†) for promoting O2 reduction. Also, XRD (Fig. 1D) was used to confirm the successful preparation of TNTs, Cu2O–TNTs and Au–TNTs.

The construction and assay procedures of the as-prepared BFC based self-powered sensors are shown in Scheme 1 (details in the ESI†). A self-powered immunoassay was established in such a device by capture antibodies (Ab1) coated in a Cu2O–TNTs anode and bilirubin oxidase (BOD) in a Au–TNT cathode. The more PSA captured in the Cu2O–TNTs anode resulted in weaker current response. This was reasonable because of the enhanced steric hindrance of immobilized proteins serving as insulating layers to severely hinder the diffusion of glucose to the surface of the Cu2O–TNTs anode and a lower yield of electrons generated. The working mechanism of the BFC based self-powered sensor could be depicted as follows: (1) (2)

In this scheme anode (A) and cathode (B) were placed in parallel; (C) storage of the generated current in the supercapacitor for 60 s; (D) instantaneous release of the stored electrical energy through the DMM once the switch was closed. 
To evaluate the performance of the as-prepared anode, a conventional three-electrode setup, with prepared Cu2O–TNTs as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl electrode (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode and platinum wire as the counter electrode, was constructed in a phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) with the absence or presence of 40 mM glucose. As seen from Fig. 2A, the Cu2O–TNTs anode exhibited obvious catalytic oxidation current in the presence of 40 mM glucose (black curve), which was significantly higher than that of the Cu2O–TNTs anode without glucose (red curve). A broad and weak oxidation current plateau, from about 0.35 to 0.75 V, was observed, which can be mainly attributed to the formation of different surface species of Cu(I) hydroxide, Cu(II) oxide, or hydroxides. This proves that the as-prepared Cu2O–TNTs anode possessed excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the oxidation of glucose. Also, the polarization curves (Fig. 2B) were recorded with 40 mM glucose and the electrocatalytic current almost reached a 0.3 μA cm−2 plateau at around 0.2 V. Such results indicated that the Cu2O–TNTs anode possessed prominent electrochemical catalytic activity toward glucose, suggesting its potential utilization as an anode catalyst in BFCs.

Fig. 2C shows the cyclic voltammetry (CV) response of the prepared BOD–Au–TNTs cathode in an O2 (red) and a N2 (black) atmosphere. It is found that the cathode did not produce observable redox response under anaerobic conditions. In contrast, a distinctly larger cathodic wave was observed when O2 was present, amplifying the O2 reduction. The two weak but differentiable redox waves at +0.20 and +0.41 V vs. Ag/AgCl were close to the redox potential of the T1 Cu site of BOD, which is the most facile electron-accepting site of BOD,14 indicating that BOD immobilized on Au–TNTs worked as an efficient direct electron transfer biocatalyst for O2 reduction. As seen from the polarization curves in Fig. 2D, the electrocatalytic reduction of O2 started at 0.54 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Such potential approached the thermodynamic equilibrium potential of  (0.61 V at pH 7.0) but became larger than some BOD-cathode employed redox mediators,15 implying the excellent electron communication established between BOD and Au–TNTs with the BOD–Au–TNTs cathode utilized. The direct electron communication between BOD and AuNPs was beneficial for the development of the cathode with a high potential output because of a low overpotential involved in O2 reduction.
The electrochemical properties of all-solid-state Ti supercapacitors were characterized by CV and the galvanostat method. In the experiment, the gel electrolyte containing poly(vinyl alcohol) and phosphoric acid was introduced between two electrodes. Fig. 2E shows CV curves with the scan rate ranging from 10 to 100 mV s−1. With scan rates varying, the CV curves remained rectangular, indicating the high electrochemical stability and capacitance. Fig. 2F shows a typical galvanostatic charge–discharge curve of the as-prepared supercapacitor at a current of 0.25 μA. The specific capacitance per unit length (CL) was calculated from CL = IΔt/LΔV, where I, Δt, L, and ΔV correspond to current (A), discharge time (s), cell length (cm) and potential window (V), with the value of CL determined to be 0.58 mF cm−1. And the specific capacitance per unit area (CS) was calculated to be approximately 0.9 mF cm−2 by CS = IΔt/SESΔV with SES as the surface area obtained by multiplying the length and circumference of utilized Ti foil. Such value fulfilled the typical CS range of 0.4–2.0 mF cm−2 reported,16 evidencing the satisfactory energy storage performance of the as-prepared supercapacitor.
The detailed operation procedures and the optimum conducting conditions (pH of the buffer solution and the incubation time) of the designed self-powered sensor are included in the ESI.† For the terminal read-out in the digital multimeter (DMM), the all-solid-state Ti supercapacitor was used to collect the current generated from the BFC based self-powered sensor. Once the switch is closed, the electrical energy stored can be released from the all-solid-state Ti supercapacitor instantaneously through DMM to obtain an amplified current and thus higher sensitivity than direct current measurement.17 As shown in Fig. 3A, an ∼16.5-fold enhancement of the current was observed from the all-solid-state Ti supercapacitor for different amounts of PSA compared with that from the BFC based self-powered sensor directly. Similarly, a good logarithmic relationship was established between amplified current and PSA concentration in the same linear range (from 0.5 pg mL−1 to 10 μg mL−1) and detection limit (0.33 pg mL−1 for PSA). The regression equations were expressed as I = 57.19–13.51lgc (R = 0.9857) and ITi = 950.90–226.09lgc (R = 0.9889) with the same limit of detection (defined as 3σ, where σ is the standard deviation of 11 measurements of blank samples) of 0.3 pM PSA, which was mainly attributed to the concomitant amplification of the background current from the self-powered sensor. Moreover, the feasibility of the as-prepared self-powered sensor for clinical application was investigated on real samples of human serum using the proposed method with acceptable reliability and accuracy attained as well (Table 1).

Furthermore, Fig. 3B displays the dependence of the power density on the cell voltage of such BFC with 10 ng mL−1 PSA present. As was seen, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the proposed BFC was 0.93 V and the maximum power density (Pmax) of 165.8 μW cm−2 was obtained at 0.62 V. Compared with the conventional BFC, the power density of the as-prepared TNTs-based BFC was relatively high, which might be attributed to the efficient electrical contact between BOD and Au–TNTs and consequently an effective bioelectrocatalysis of glucose and O2.
The feasibility of this self-powered sensor for clinical application was investigated on several real samples of human serum. In order to cover the wide linear detection range of the proposed protocol, these serum samples were used either as-received or diluted to a specific concentration with 0.1 M PBS (pH 7.4). The results for PSA are listed in Table 1. By comparison with the ELISA method, the RSDs obtained from the developed method showed acceptable feasibility to detect PSA in human serum. Satisfactory results were achieved, proving the potentiality of this self-powered sensor for practical applications with good sensitivity and selectivity.
In this work, a low-cost, simple, and portable BFC based self-powered sensor integrating a supercapacitor device was developed for PSA detection. By the integration of BFC and the supercapacitor with TNTs as both the electrode substrate and the supercapacitor, the as-prepared device realized the dual functions of energy conversion and storage simultaneously. The non-enzyme Cu2O–TNTs anode exhibited excellent oxidation activity towards glucose while the BOD–Au–TNTs cathode served as a direct bioelectrocatalyst for the reduction of O2 to H2O. By the omission of the derivatization agent and expensive apparatus, the proposed method possessed high sensitivity, good reproducibility, and long-term stability for quantitative detection of PSA and became a promising platform for detection of other proteins. Also it was emphasized that by such a BFC based self-powered sensor, a simple, economical, sensitive, and portable device can be built which can be applied for disease diagnosis and environmental monitoring in the coming future.
