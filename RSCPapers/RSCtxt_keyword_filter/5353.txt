Proper phase formation was confirmed by X-ray diffraction studies, whereas the morphological features were investigated using field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The bonding information and the presence of organic functional groups within the synthesized nanostructures were confirmed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The work function of the material was calculated using first principles studies. In an attempt to explore the potential of the perovskites beyond photovoltaic applications, the field emission performance of the nanostructured CH3NH3PbI3 was investigated. The turn-on field (electric field corresponding to a 10 μA cm−2 current density) was obtained as 4.2 V μm−1 with the current density reaching up to 96 μA cm−2 for an inter-electrode spacing of 200 μm for the nanorod samples. The emission current stability was tested to be good enough for as long as 2 hours. Finally, finite element-based simulations were performed using ANSYS to obtain a theoretical perception of our experimental findings.
Introduction
With the remarkable development of industry-based urban civilization during the last few decades, huge requirement of uninterrupted energy supply has also increased. The traditional usage of fossil fuels for power harnessing cannot be a permanent solution to solve this demand. In this regard, several new technologies and advanced materials have been developed to harness consumable power from solar energy. Copper-based ternary oxides,1 low-dimensional chalcogenides,2 and metal halides have been identified as new age solar-cell candidates. However, their applications are still under investigation compared to established effectiveness of silicon in this sector. Silicon-based solar cells are still much popular due to their suitable power conversion ability,3 nontoxicity, and availability. Moreover, the most important feature of this material is its multipurpose applications. Therefore, new materials for solar cells and any other advanced technology need to possess easily tunable optical and electrical properties for multipurpose applications to be commercialized. Organometallic halides have been identified as a promising group in this regard.4 Among this group, methylammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3) has already shown remarkable power conversion efficiency, crossing the certified value of ∼20%.5–7 This material has attracted significant research interest due its physical properties. CH3NH3PbI3 has a perovskite structure, where CH3NH3+ cations lie within the framework of PbI2− octahedra. In each of these octahedrons, one Pb2+ cation resides at the center and coordinates with 6 apical I− ions.8 At room temperature, it possesses a tetragonal crystal structure.9 This material is under extensive research focus due to its interesting optoelectronic properties such as a high absorption coefficient,10 easily tunable band gap,11 long carrier diffusion lengths,12 and high carrier mobility.13 Moreover, low temperature synthesis14 routes have been found for this material, which enable a low production cost and better opportunities for fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3-based composites without hampering the intrinsic properties of the counterparts. Owing to these features, CH3NH3PbI3 is now being used in several photo-induced applications such as in LEDs,15 photodetectors,16 and field effect transistors,17 in addition to being used in the photovoltaic industry.18
However, most of the applications based on this material utilize its photovoltaic character. Some other aspects, apart from the photovoltaic aspect, have not been properly investigated to date. As reported in our previous study, metal halides and copper-based binary and ternary oxides, etc. can often show enhanced luminescence and field emission (FE) properties with wide range tuning via variation of the synthesis and structural parameters.19 This type of electron emission has tremendous applications in the area of field emission displays (FEDs), pressure sensors, field emission microscopy (e.g. FESEM), etc. It is observed that low-dimensional semiconductor nanostructures are in general promising electron emitters. Some well-known field emission materials, such as CNTs,20 RGO nanocomposites,21 ZnO,22 graphene,23 LaB6,24 MoS2,25 MoO2,26etc., are well studied and have already been commercialized. However, almost all of these have limitations related to their synthesis routes, stability, toxicity, etc. To the best of our knowledge, to date, no study has been reported on the field emission behavior of CH3NH3PbI3 nanostructures. Additionally, theoretical and experimental studies on the electronic-band-related properties of this novel halide are contradictory to each other and display a wide range of results.27–29 Even if the photovoltaic applications are considered to be the sole purpose of this material, work-function-related studies are of utmost important to achieve a better control over their excitation parameters and an explanation of their experimental outputs. In addition to the aforementioned issues, production costs often emerge as a decisive factor for the commercial application of any novel and multifunctional material. This study was focused on the tuning of the FE properties of CH3NH3PbI3 in low-dimension by a cost-effective chemical route, and variations of the shape/dimension of this novel material were achieved by simple variation of the synthesis parameters, which resulted in some encouraging outcomes.
A prior knowledge of the work function value is essential to figure out the enhancement factor and understand the field emission properties of any material. As a way to overcome the ambiguity related to the work function of this material, we employed a theoretical approach using DFT-based first principles analysis. The outcome of this study was further used to calculate various field emission parameters. The dependence of the field emission parameters upon the shape of the CH3NH3PbI3 emitters was also studied through ANSYS Maxwell simulation. The results obtained via this simulation-based study were further correlated with the experimental output. To check the applicability of CH3NH3PbI3 in practical devices, emission current stability was considered as an important factor, and it was studied for as long as 2 h. The field emission performance executed by this novel halide CH3NH3PbI3, as presented in this study, clearly indicates it to be a future promising candidate for emission-based display devices, which further may be included in photo-excitable cold emission devices.
Experimental
All the chemicals used in our synthesis were purchased from Merck (India) and used without any further purification.
Synthesis of CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals
In a typical process, 0.5 g lead(II) acetate trihydrate (Pb(CH3COO)2·3H2O) was added to 3 ml 55% HI solution, and then, the mixture was ultrasonicated for 5 minutes. Then, 1 ml methylamine ethanol solution (CH3NH2, 33%) was drop-wise added to the previous solution. An immediate black precipitate was formed, and it was stirred for 10 minutes at room temperature. After discarding the extra solvent, the precipitate was filtered and washed three times with isopropanol (99.5%). Finally, the filtered product was dried at 100 °C for 30 minutes. Furthermore, additional time resolved experiments were carried out to explore the morphological variances of the CH3NH3PbI3 nanostructure.
Synthesis of CH3NH3PbI3 nanorods
In this case, after adding 1 ml methylamine, the solution was kept for 3 h, then the extra solvent was discarded, and numerous reddish yellow needle-like crystals were obtained, which were formed at the bottom of the beaker and visible to the naked eye. Afterwards, we obtained the product by filtering and washing the crystals three times with isopropanol (99.5%), and finally, the as-filtered product was dried at 100 °C for 30 minutes.
Characterization
The as-synthesized samples were subjected to several characterizations. The proper phase formation was investigated using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advanced) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). The morphological analysis was carried out using field emission scanning electron microscopic studies (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800), whereas exact dimensions of the nanostructures and the lattice images were obtained by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEOL JEM 2010). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Shimadzu) revealed the bonding information of the samples. Finally, all the samples were investigated using our laboratory-made high vacuum field emission set-up to study the field emission properties, and cold emission current density and other relevant FE parameters were obtained for all the samples. ANSYS Maxwell was further used to carry out a finite element electrostatic simulation study of the effects of the dimensional variations of the sample. The outcomes of this simulation-based study were correlated with the experimental results.
Results and discussion
Structural studies
The phase of the as-prepared samples was confirmed using X-ray diffraction with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 40 kV and 40 mA in the normal θ–2θ scanning mode at 0.2 s per step. Fig. 1 depicts the XRD profiles of the samples. The figure shows the presence of diffraction peaks corresponding to the (110), (112), (211), (202), (004), (220), (213), (114), (310), (312), (224), (411), (314), and (404) planes indexed at the 2θ (degree) = 14.10, 19.90, 23.60, 24.50, 28.10, 28.40, 30.90, 31.60, 31.80, 34.90, 40.40, 42.60, 43.10, and 50.20, respectively which confirm the formation of highly crystalline tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 (I4/mcm).30–32 However, some minor peaks arising at 12.68°, 26.51°, and 52.52° denote the presence of (001), (002), and (004) planes of hexagonal lead iodide (PDF #00-007-0235), respectively.33 This subtle presence of PbI2 is generally attributed to the inevitable small scale degradation of CH3NH3PbI3.34 However, we proposed (in the next section) an alternative approach to explain the presence of these additional peaks correlating those obtained via the growth routes. The crystallite sizes of CH3NH3PbI3 nanorods and nanocrystals were calculated using the well-known Scherrer's formula: L = kλ/(βcosθ)(1)where L = average crystal size, k = shape factor with a typical value of 0.94, which actually varies with the crystal shape, λ = wavelength of the X-ray, which is 1.5406 Å, β = full width half maximum (FWHM) of the peak, which is obtained in radians, and θ = the diffraction angle of the peak measured in degrees.

The lattice parameters of the samples were also determined from Bragg's relation as follows: 2dsinθ = nλ(2)where d = 1/√[h2/a2 + k2/b2 + l2/c2] = the inter-planar spacing of the set of planes (hkl), θ = Bragg angle, n = order of reflection corresponding to (hkl), λ = wavelength of X-ray, and a, b, and c are the lattice parameters. From our XRD data, we obtained a = b = 8.8757 Å and c = 12.6478 Å, which agreed well with other reported values.35 The obtained values of inter-planar spacing d and grain size L are presented in Table 1.

It can be seen from the table that the crystallite sizes are smaller for nanocrystals than those for nanorods for almost all of the diffraction planes. An apparent discrepancy related to the dimension and crystallite sizes appeared in view of the morphological features of the samples (discussed later), but the same was explained to be occurring due to the individual growth processes of the crystals and nanorods.
Compositional studies
Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was performed for the two samples to check the stoichiometric balance of the constituent elements, and the results are summarized in Table 2. The results showed that each sample contained the main constituent elements Pb and I in an almost accurate stoichiometric ratio, whereas the CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals were found to contain a slightly higher amount of the halide counterpart. This result can be explained by the tricky difference introduced in the synthesis techniques for the formation of nanorods and nanocrystals. Appreciable stirring was performed in the initial stage of synthesis in the case of the nanocrystals. This enabled a higher amount of unreacted Pb precursor to come in contact with the unreacted iodine precursors. Hence, a higher amount of iodine could be included in the compound. On the other hand, in the case of nanorods, this initial stirring was excluded, and the reaction pot was kept still for several hours. After the formation of a certain amount of target compound, i.e., CH3NH3PbI3, in the reaction medium, the unreacted Pb precursor could not come in direct contact with fresh halide ions, and hence, further iodization was restricted. This could also be verified from two aspects of the XRD results. As abovementioned, some peaks corresponding to PbI2 occurred in both samples. The peak intensities of this byproduct were compared with those of the main peaks in the case of both samples. It was observed that the relative intensity for PbI2 was much higher (0.2304) in the case of nanocrystal samples than that observed in the case of nanorods (0.0785). This observation is in full agreement with the mechanism proposed above. The elemental mapping and the EDX spectra of the nanorods and nanocrystals are respectively presented in Fig. S3 and S4 in the ESI.†

Morphological studies
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was employed to observe the morphologies of the as-synthesized samples. It can be seen from Fig. 2a and b that CH3NH3PbI3 nanorods have an average diameter of ∼150–200 nm with an average length of ∼5–6 μm, whereas the CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals have an average diameter of ∼750–800 nm. As abovementioned in the X-ray studies, the nanocrystal samples synthesized in this study showed smaller crystallites but higher dimensional particles. However, the nanorods were comparatively smaller in dimension, but they contained larger crystallites. It must be kept in mind that X-ray diffraction normally reflects the crystallite size and range of ordering or crystallinity, whereas FESEM depicts the actual shape of the sample, which may be composed of several grains/crystallites. Considering the synthesis techniques, we knew that the nanocrystals were formed in stirring media. Stirring caused frequent exposure of fresh lead ions to iodine and organic ions; hence, a different combination of lattice planes is formed for a short duration. As a result, different crystallites formed in this case tend to be of a small dimension. These small crystallites are free to coexist adjacent to each other; this results in large microcrystals. As a result, huge microcrystals are expected to occur, and they are free to reside in a dense distribution, as observed in Fig. 2(d). On the other hand, the CH3NH3PbI3 nanorods were formed under a resting condition; each plane in the nanorods was allowed to grow over a longer time, and this might possibly resulted in a higher range ordering with a larger crystallite size. However, any crystallite cannot grow infinitely large; several factors, such as surface energy minimization and the chemical potential of the precursors, restrict the range of ordering. Thus, the nanorods are expected to contain single or a few number of lattice planes with high ordering range/crystallites and distinctly separate from each other. The high magnification FESEM image presented in Fig. 2(b) shows that the nanorods are distributed in the visible area in a comparatively less compact fashion than that found in the case of nanocrystals (Fig. 2(d)). However, if the proposed mechanism has to be established properly, the lattice images should show the features of long-range ordering in the case of nanorods, which can only be obtained from TEM analysis.

The inset of Fig. 3(a) shows a single nanorod with an ∼1 μm length and ∼55 nm diameter. Fig. 3(a) reveals the d value for the CH3NH3PbI3 nanorods as ∼0.28 nm, which corresponds to the (310) planes of the tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 lattice. A large portion of the rod was found to be contained in this plane as the major portion; this supports our XRD studies inferring long-range ordering. The crystalline nature of the nanorods can be supported by the SAED pattern shown in Fig. 3(b). The regular arrangement of bright spots found in the SAED pattern directly indicates the single crystallinity of the nanorods. On the other hand, the FESEM images, as depicted in Fig. 2(d), show that the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals are much higher in dimension as well as thicker; hence, it is difficult to obtain lattice images. However, to compare the crystallinity of two samples (as shown in Fig. 2(b) and (d)), SAED patterns were compared, as shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c). It can be seen that the SAED patterns corresponding to the large crystals show a well-defined ring pattern typically found for polycrystals.

Optical studies
UV-vis spectroscopic measurements were carried out for the as-prepared powder samples to figure out their energy band gaps. BaSO4 was used as a standard reference with respect to which the reflectance data of the samples were obtained. Sharp falls in R (%) were observed, indicating the highly crystalline nature of these two samples. The Kubelka–Munk function vs. photon energy (eV) was plotted to calculate the band gap of the samples. First, the simple conversion relation was used to evaluate the photon energy: Energy (eV) = 1240/λ (nm)(3)
Moreover, the Kubelka–Munk function was defined in terms of the following equation: [F(R∞)hν]1/n = A(hν − Eg)(4)where F(R∞) = (1 − R)2/2R, A = a proportionality constant, hν = photon energy measured in eV, Eg = energy band gap, and n is an index characterizing the nature of the energy band transitions depending upon if it is direct or indirect, allowed or forbidden, etc. Now, as CH3NH3PbI3 is a direct band gap type semiconductor, we took n = 1/2. Via extrapolating the linear portion of [F(R∞)hν]2vs. hν plot, the values of Eg were determined.
The optical band gaps turned out to be 1.54 eV and 1.57 eV for CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals and nanorods, respectively, which agree well with other reported values.36,37 The difference in the band gaps of these two samples can be accounted for their different sizes. As obtained from the electron microscopy images, the rods have an average diameter of ∼150–200 nm, whereas the nanocrystals have an average diameter of ∼1 μm. This low diameter value of the rods leads to a higher band gap value as compared to that of the nanocrystals counterpart. The spectra and [F(R∞)hν]2vs. hν plots are presented in Fig. S1 in the ESI.†
The bonding information and presence of unaccounted complex organic ions within the samples were studied by FTIR spectroscopy. It was important to assure that no unreacted organic precursor are present in the sample. The synthesis was carried out at very low temperature; hence, the auto-removal of weakly interacting organic molecules or complex ions, such as in the sol–gel process, could not be achieved. They might also not be detected via tools such as XRD and EDX. However, these loosely bound (if any) attachments are expected to contribute adversely in the cold emission process when subjected to an external electric field. The absence of any such functionalized groups was confirmed by FTIR studies. The FTIR transmittance spectra in Fig. S2 in the ESI† showed peaks at 918.7 cm−1, 983.1 cm−1, 1250.6 cm−1, 1415.3 cm−1, and 1586.8 cm−1, which were assigned to NH3+/CH3 rocking, C–N stretching, NH3+/CH3 rocking, symmetric CH3 bending, and asymmetric NH3 bending, respectively, which agreed well with previous reports on this material.38,39
Density functional theory (DFT) calculation of the work function
To estimate the work function of the (110) surface of tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 through first principles, computations were carried out using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)40–43 with the projector-augmented-wave (PAW)44 approach. The exchange–correlation contributions were taken into account via the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)45 functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The plane wave basis set-up to an energy cut-off of 400 eV was utilized throughout the calculations. For the geometrical optimizations, the structures were allowed to relax until the total energy converged below 10−4 eV per atom. A 2 × 2 × 2 k-mesh was used for the geometrical optimization of the tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 structure, whereas a k-mesh of 1 × 5 × 5 was used for the calculation of the work function of the (110) surface of CH3NH3PbI3. A vacuum slab of 30 Å was deployed on the CH3NH3PbI3 (110) surface to exclude any false interaction. The work function ϕ was obtained via the following formula:Φ = Evac − EFwhere EF is the Fermi energy and Evac is the reference vacuum energy level. EF and Evac were obtained through an scf calculation under the spin-restricted condition.
Initially, the tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 unit cell was optimized, and the lattice parameters were found to be a = 8.79 Å and c = 12.98 Å, which agreed well with the previous reports.46 A (2 × 2) view from the z direction of the optimized CH3NH3PbI3 structure is given in Fig. 4c. Next, the (110) surface of CH3NH3PbI3 was constructed and relaxed, as is shown in Fig. 4b. In our calculations, the vacuum energy Evac was estimated from the constant value of the planar average electrostatic potential at a large distance from the surface, and the Fermi energy EF was found from the DFT calculations. For the (110) surface of CH3NH3PbI3, EF and Evac were found to be −4.2035 eV and 0.9665 eV, respectively, resulting in a work function (ϕ) value of 5.17 eV. The variation of the planar average electrostatic potential with the distance from the surface, as has been found from the first principle calculations, is presented in Fig. 4a.

Field emission study
Field emission properties of the as-synthesized CH3NH3PbI3 nanorods and nanocrystals were determined using our homemade high vacuum field emission set-up. The set-up included two electrodes consisting of a stainless steel platform, which acted as a cathode, and a stainless steel conical tip (1.5 mm diameter), which acted as an anode. Mounting of the samples on the stainless steel platform was carefully carried out by placing a double-sided conducting carbon tape (5 mm, Nisshin EM. Co. Ltd) on this stainless steel platform at first. Then, the as-prepared powder samples were pasted onto this double-sided conducting carbon tape by pressing them adequately to form films. The pasting was performed using a glass slide to ensure maximum smoothness and uniformity of the emitting surface as well as contact of the emitter nanostructures with the tape. The samples were placed at different inter-electrode distances by a micrometer screw attached to the system. Furthermore, this entire diode system was placed in a transparent chamber, which was evacuated up to ∼10−6 mbar base pressure using a combination of a rotary and oil diffusion pumps. The transparency of the chamber enabled us to ensure that no discharge from the surface of the sample took place while applying a high electric field. The emission current I and the applied electric field E are theoretically related by the equation:47,48 I = (Aaβ2E2/ϕ)exp[−bϕ3/2/(βE)](5)where ϕ and β are the local work function and the field enhancement factor, respectively, A is the emission area (= area of the anode tip = (π/4) × (1.5 mm)2), and a and b are Fowler–Nordheim (F–N) constants having values of a = 1.54 × 10−6 A eV V−2 and b = 6.83 × 103 eV−3/2 V μm−1. E was calculated by dividing the externally applied input voltage V (in volts) by the inter-electrode distance x (in μm).

Eqn (5) can be rewritten as follows: ln(J/E2) = ln(aβ2/ϕ) − bϕ3/2/(βE)(6)where J = I/A is the emission current density.
Hence, a plot of ln(J/E2) vs. 1/E gives a straight line having a slope (say m) = −bϕ3/2/β and an intercept = ln(aβ2/ϕ). Thus, based on this slope, the field enhancement factor β can be figured out as follows: β = −bϕ3/2/m(7)
Moreover, the effective work function ϕeff, i.e., the work function reduced locally at the emission sites, is obtained from the relation given below:48,49 ϕeff = ϕ/β2/3(8)
Effect of the emitter morphology

Fig. 5a shows the J–E curves obtained from the experimentally observed current voltage data for both CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals and nanorods at x = 200 μm, and the inset of this figure provides a closer view of the J–E characteristics for the nanocrystals. As this figure demonstrates, the nanocrystals yield a current density of the order of 0.5 μA cm−2 under a large externally applied electric field of more than 10 V μm−1, whereas the nanorods attain a current density of 100 μA cm−2 under a 6 V μm−1 external field. This indicates a 200-fold enhancement of the current density, indicating the superiority of the 1D nanostructure over its 2D counterpart. The better FE performance of CH3NH3PbI3 nanorods as compared to that of the nanocrystals can be explained in terms of their morphology and crystallinity. Generally, materials with high curvature points in their geometrical structures possess a tendency to accumulate electric fields at these locations to lower the work function locally and tunnel electrons through the remaining potential barrier. Thus, the field value at these points is now not just the E that was applied externally, but it becomes enhanced to a value of βE (β = local field enhancement factor). From the FESEM images, it is very clear that the CH3NH3PbI3 nanorods have a higher aspect ratio as compared to the CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals. Thus, these nanorods, due to their sharp geometry, make the electric lines of force condensed and pile up near the edges; this effectively triggers an enhancement of the field near these edges. These edges then act like electron emission sites and produce a high emission current density. On the contrary, the nanocrystals possess blunt flat surfaces and lack sharp peripheral edges; thus, they cannot converge the field lines and hence are not favorable for cold electron emission.

Furthermore, the crystallinity of the samples plays a vital role in electron emission. If we consider that after applying an electric field, an electron tunnels out of the surface potential barrier of a nanostructure, reaches the anode tip, traverses through the external circuit, and finally goes to the ground, another electron from the ground must enter back to that nanostructure again to maintain the closed channel of electrons, which produces the current. This is where the situations differ for nanorods and nanocrystals in our case. The nanorods being quasi-single crystalline in nature, as revealed from the TEM images, can easily obtain electrons supplied from the ground. However, for nanocrystals, which have a polycrystalline nature, the electrons supplied from the ground get obstructed while entering the nanocrystals. They get scattered whenever they cross an inter-crystalline grain boundary. Thus, only a few electrons survive this energy loss due to scattering and contribute to the emission current.
Effect of electrode separation
As the first report on the electric field emission of CH3NH3PbI3, our investigation was extended to find out the effect of the inter-electrode separation on the cold emission behavior. Herein, three more distances of 120 μm, 150 μm, and 180 μm were adjusted, and the FE experiment was repeated for each case. The obtained J–E characteristics are presented in Fig. 5b, whereas their corresponding F–N plots along with those obtained at 200 μm are depicted in Fig. 5c. Fig. 5b indicates that with the increasing inter-electrode distance, the current densities for CH3NH3PbI3 nanorods increase.
This is due to the fact that as we increase the inter-electrode separation, the region of the sample placed right beneath the anode gets more exposed to the anode, and due to this, the inter-electrode field acts upon a greater number of electrons.50 From the slopes of all the F–N plots, we calculated β by putting ϕ = 5.17 eV (calculated from DFT) in eqn (7). Fig. 5d displays the variation of the turn-on field (the electric field required to produce the current density of 10 μA cm−2) and the local field enhancement factor β with the inter-electrode spacing. This figure demonstrates the same above-mentioned phenomenon that increase in the inter-electrode distance leads to an increasing number of electrons reaching the anode as a consequence of the inclusion of a higher number of emitters. However, increase in the electrode separation beyond 200 μm caused inferior FE properties with maximum current densities of 70 and 45 μA cm−2 for 250 and 350 μm distances, respectively (as presented in the ESI,† Fig. S6). These results may be accounted for the increased potential barrier appearing due to a too high increment of the inter-electrode distances.
The effective work function was also estimated using eqn (8), and the values of ϕeff obtained for different inter-electrode separations are presented in Fig. 5e. The enhancement of the FE performance with the increasing inter-electrode distance d can also be considered equivalent to that resulting due to the reduced effective work functions.48,51
Temporal stability of emission
To be realized in effective emission-based devices, any new proposed emitter material must be tested to check the time stability of cold emission. This is an even more crucial factor for CH3NH3PbI3 field emitters. However, the high vulnerability of these halides under harsh external reagents might introduce unexpected newer barriers against their real-life applications. The nanorod samples, being the best CH3NH3PbI3 nanostructure for FE applications, were subjected to a high external field for a long duration, and the output current density was studied. This experiment was performed keeping the inter-electrode separation as 200 μm since this was the best optimized condition. As shown in Fig. 5f, the output current density maintained an average value of 23.6 μA cm−2 with appreciable stability when applied with an external bias of 5 V μm−1 for the period of 2 h. This result can also be attributed to the quasi-single crystalline nature of the CH3NH3PbI3 nanorods. Locally generated heat, even to a very small extent, can have adverse effects on the cold crystallinity, material composition, and sharpness of the morphology. These are very strong factors governing the cold electron emission. As field emission properties are often considered as a local phenomenon in very close proximity of the emission site, these factors become even more crucial. As abovementioned in the earlier subsection, the long-range ordering in CH3NH3PbI3 nanorods enables less scattering of the electrons and hence a lower probability of energy dissipation in the form of heat. This in turn results in a stable cold emission current density, as observed in the abovementioned figure. It was also observed that the CH3NH3PbI3 nanorods subjected to a high external electric field entirely retained their morphological features (Fig. S5, ESI†).
ANSYS simulations
To verify the experimental FE results, the finite element method FEM using ANSYS Maxwell simulation software was employed, and the local electric field distribution of the samples was simulated. For this, first, the 2-dimensional models for both nanostructures, i.e., the nanocrystals and nanorods, were modeled, and the input parameters, such as electrode separation, and dimension of the emitters, were selected as per the actual basis. Fig. 6a shows the 2D model of CH3NH3PbI3 nanocrystals having dimensions ∼750–800 nm, whereas the nanorods bear an average length of ∼5–6 μm and diameter of ∼150–200 nm (Fig. 6b). The anode-emitter distance was maintained at 120 μm, and the applied electric field was 2 kV for both models. The horizontal colored panel just below Fig. 6a and b represents the different output electric field intensity distributions, whereas the red and blue colors indicate the maximum and minimum field values, respectively. From the simulated results, it can be clearly observed that the nanorods emit a higher electric field than the nanocrystals; this corroborates the experimental FE results.

Thus, from the theoretical and experimental studies, it is clear that CH3NH3PbI3 nanostructures are potential field emitters. A comparative collection of the FE results is summarized in Table 3 for most of the good performing field emitters, and it can be seen that the CH3NH3PbI3 structures have comparable FE characteristics, particularly keeping in mind that this is the first report for the same. However, it may be mentioned that the improvement of technology is often an evolutionary process, and further work and innovations are necessary for realizing these materials as excellent field emitters. For example, morphological variation and surface treatment with other low work function materials may be a future scope of research.

Conclusions
The field emission properties of nanocrystals and nanorods of CH3NH3PbI3 have been reported for the first time. The samples were prepared by a very simple wet chemical approach. After proper characterizations by XRD, EDX, FESEM, TEM, UV-vis spectroscopy, and FTIR spectroscopy, the field emission property of these samples was investigated. The compositional and structural observations were explained as a direct consequence of the synthesis techniques. Among the two samples, the nanorods showed a considerable field emission behavior with current density reaching ∼96 μA cm−2 and a turn-on field of 4.2 V μm−1 primarily owing to their rod-like 1D nanostructure. The comparatively lower current density obtained in the case of the nanocrystals was addressed in terms of their low aspect ratio and polycrystalline nature. The dependence of the FE properties, e.g., field enhancement factor and turn-on field, upon the inter-electrode separation was also studied. The temporal stability of the emission current, playing a crucial role from the application point of view, was checked for 2 h. The work function ϕ (5.17 eV) of the material was calculated from DFT analysis. Furthermore, a theoretical analogy by ANSYS simulation was provided to validate our experimental findings. This present study leads to a new approach for the potential application of CH3NH3PbI3 in emission-based display and other devices. It also provokes further research on the FE properties of other related halide perovskites with different morphologies.
