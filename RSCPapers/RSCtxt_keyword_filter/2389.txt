    , Accepted 11th September 2012First published on 12th September 2012AbstractThis study presents a simple approach to improve the performance of small molecule based organic solar cells (OSCs) by inserting a fluorinated buffer layer (e.g., PFAS) at the hetero-interface of bilayer devices. As demonstrated in this work, the PFAS modification reduces the surface energy of the conventional PEDOT:PSS photoanode and results in a significant improvement in the pentacene based OSC. The passivated PEDOT:PSS surface after PFAS modification has a lower interface energy with pentacene and facilitates 3D single crystalline (dendritic-like) phase pentacene growth. Concurrently, the accumulated negative charges of the fluorinated PFAS layer result in the development of interfacial dipole moments that in turn lead to an enhanced built-in potential across the devices, and consequently enhanced hole transport efficiency. Improved performance of the modified OSCs is evident from the ∼97% enhancement in efficiency from 0.88% to 1.73%, along with the open-circuit voltage improvement from 0.29 to 0.42 V. As well as improving the photovoltaic performance, the PFAS treatment also enhances the stability of the device under high temperature annealing, which is essential in the fabrication process.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted much attention during recent decades. Compared to conventional photovoltaic devices, organic solar cells have the advantages of low-cost fabrication and flexibility.1 The performance of photovoltaic devices is generally defined by the power conversion efficiency (PCE), which is determined by processes including light absorption (generation of excitons),2 exciton diffusion,3 charge separation,3 charge transport,3,4 and charge collection.5 It has been shown that the PCE could be greatly increased by enhancing the carrier-transport efficiency in highly ordered bulk hetero-junctions.3 In addition, modifications of both contacts have been demonstrated to improve the balance of hole and electron collection rates, which could increase the overall efficiencies.5,6
In this study, we present a simple approach to improve the performance of small molecule based OSCs by introducing a fluorine-containing buffer layer to improve the molecular orientation of the active layers. With better aligned molecules in the OSC, the transport of excitons and carriers can be substantially enhanced as demonstrated in the case of the pentacene/C60 bilayer OSC. Generally, pentacene has a high degree of structural disorder because it is composed of two mixed crystalline morphologies, namely the dendrite-like domain perpendicular to the substrate and the fiber-like structure lying flat on the substrate.7–9 Such structural disorder has undermined the electrical performances of devices due to the presence of trap states at the grain boundaries.10
In this study, we propose to reduce the surface energy of the polyethylenedioxythiophene doped with polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) layer, a conventional photoanode used in pentacene based OSC devices, by introducing a (heptadecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetra-hydrodecyl) triethoxysilane (PFAS) buffer layer before the deposition of pentacene. There are three main advantages of using PFAS for the modification. First, PFAS is one of the lowest surface energy materials due to the –CF or –F functional groups.11 Secondly, the hydrophobicity of –CF can reduce the degradation caused by moisture due to the humidity of ambient air conditions.12 Thirdly, PFAS is a silanol based material possessing a large dipole moment.13 We hypothesized that the fluorine-containing PFAS could effectively reduce the surface energy and change the molecular orientation of pentacene during the deposition. In this way, single phase pentacene with improved carrier transport, therefore enhanced performance, of the OSC can be anticipated.
Experimental section
All the chemicals were purchased from Aldrich. The polymer based OSCs in this work were fabricated on glass substrates coated with indium tin oxide (ITO, sheet resistance of 15 Ω, Aldrich). The ITO-coated glass was cleaned and ultrasonicated in detergent solution, then sonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol. A buffer layer of PEDOT:PSS of about 30 nm thick was achieved by spin-coating (5000 rpm for 30 s) in aqueous solution onto the ITO-coated glass substrates.
Various concentrations of PFAS dissolved in chlorobenzene were spin-coated (5000 rpm for 30 s) to obtain a thin layer on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer, which was subsequently annealed at 180 °C in air. The amount of PFAS was controlled by its concentration in the chlorobenzene, which was kept at 5% volume for the final OSC device fabrication. The surface energy of the PFAS film was evaluated by measuring the contact angles using two test liquids: water and diiodomethane (CH2I2).14
In this study, both pristine and PFAS-modified PEDOT:PSS layers (PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS/PFAS, respectively) were used as the substrate for pentacene deposition. Fig. 1 illustrates the schematics of both standard and modified device structures of the pentacene-based OSCs, without and with the PFAS interlayer as shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. The pentacene thin film was deposited under a thermal deposition system, using a source temperature of ∼230 °C under a base pressure of approximately 10−6 Torr, at a deposition rate of ∼1.1 Å s−1. The thickness of the pentacene film was controlled by the duration of deposition for the morphological study, while for OSC fabrication the thickness was maintained at 40 nm. In the next step, a 40 nm thick C60 layer was deposited by thermal evaporation, followed by a 5 nm thick BCP coating on the top. Finally the fabrication of the pentacene/C60 bilayer solar cells was completed by depositing a 100 nm thick Ag metallic top layer by thermal evaporation.

The photoactive area of the OSC devices was maintained at around 4 mm2. The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured with an I–V source meter Keithley 2400, either in the dark or under the illumination of an AM 1.5 solar simulator, which was calibrated through a Si reference cell.
The thermal annealing process was performed inside a glove box under an inert atmosphere. At each designated temperature ranging from 120 to 200 °C, the annealing was performed for 3 min followed by cooling to ambient temperature.
The surface roughness and morphology of the films were characterized by a JPK atomic force microscope (AFM) under tapping-mode. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using an X-ray diffractometer with a vertical-type goniometer and a rotating anode X-ray generator in reflection mode, with a Ni-filtered Cu K radiation source. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) data were obtained using a Perkin Elmer phi-560 system. To determine the mobility of the pentacene films, hole-only ITO/PEDOT:PSS/pentacene (100 nm)/Au and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PFAS/pentacene (100 nm)/Au devices were fabricated. The hole mobilities were determined using the space charge limiting current (SCLC) method.
Results and discussion
Effect of PFAS-modification

Characterization of PEDOT:PSS substrates. 
Prior to the characterization of the pentacene active layer, it is important to investigate the surface properties of the unmodified PEDOT:PSS layer and PFAS-modified layer (PEDOT:PSS/PFAS), which were later used as the hole-transporting substrate. It has been reported that the surface roughness of the substrate can affect the morphology of the deposited organic semiconductor thin film and hence the OSC device performance.14 However, AFM studies showed that the PEDOT:PSS layers, with or without PFAS modification, have a root-mean-square value of the surface roughness (Rrms) of around 1.5 nm, (see Table 1 and Fig. S1a and S1b†). Interestingly, the contact angle measurements (Fig. S1c and S1d†) showed a clear reduction of the total surface energy and polar components of the PEDOT:PSS layer after the PFAS-modification (Table 1). These AFM studies combined with contact angle measurements indicate that the PFAS modification results in a hydrophobic character (low surface energy) of the PEDOT:PSS/PFAS surface without changing its surface roughness.

Characterization of pentacene thin film. 

Fig. 2a shows the topography of the pentacene layer deposited on the PEDOT:PSS surfaces, showing herringbone stacking with the long-axis oriented domains perpendicular to the substrate, resulting in dendritic (001) crystalline domains. On the other hand, fiber-like structures composed of the (110) crystalline grains lying flat on the surface also exist (Fig. 2a). Fig. 3a shows the XRD spectrum for a pentacene film deposited on pristine PEDOT:PSS, showing an interplanar d spacing of ∼15.7 Å, similar to the reported literature value.10 The AFM study (Fig. 2a) suggests that the pentacene growth was initiated by the formation of isolated two-dimensional (2D) islands. With the increase in film-thickness, the 2D islands grew laterally and coalesced into a monolayer as shown in Fig. S2a.†

(c) The corresponding hole mobility of the hole only device with the structure of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/pentacene (100 nm)/Au system, with (red circles) and without (black squares) the PFAS (0.5%) modification. 
In contrast, on PEDOT:PSS/PFAS, three-dimensional (3D) islands grew at the initial stage, as observed from the AFM images in Fig. 2b and S2b.† Evidently, the pentacene thin film grown on PEDOT:PSS/PFAS exhibits a highly textured morphology, compared with that on pristine PEDOT:PSS, without any appearance of fiber like (110) structures (Fig. 3a).
These growth modes, observed for the pentacene film on PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS/PFAS substrates, have basically followed two different growth models, namely the Stranski–Krastanov (SK) and Volmer–Weber (VW) models, respectively. According to the SK model, the pentacene molecules approaching the PEDOT:PSS surface would be strongly bound to that surface, because the surface energy of the PEDOT:PSS (62.44 mJ m−2) is higher than that of pentacene (∼38 mJ m−2). Basically, the pristine PEDOT:PSS surface would favor lateral growth,14 following the SK mode (Fig. 2c), hence the formation of fiber like structures would be preferable. In contrast, for the pentacene on PEDOT:PSS/PFAS with low surface energy (9.48 mJ m−2), the VW growth mode could take place as shown in Fig. 2d. In VW mode, the interactions between the deposited molecules would become stronger than their interactions with the substrate, and hence the formation of 3D islands would become favourable.14 Such dominance of vertical growth is expected not to support the lateral growth of the fiber like structures. Inevitably, such morphology with solely dendritic-like crystalline domains of pentacene on PEDOT:PSS/PFAS should improve the electrical conduction in a sandwich device structure, while for the pristine PEDOT:PSS based structure the scattering loss of charge-carrier would be significant.
In order to evaluate the hole transporting property, dark J–V measurements have been performed on the hole-only transporting devices with and without the PFAS modification. Fig. 3b shows the J–V characteristics of the hole only devices and the corresponding fitting results according to the space charge limited current (SCLC) equation.15 It was observed that the SCLC equation fits well to the experimental results and the corresponding hole mobility could also be calculated as shown in Fig. 3c. It is found that the hole mobility values (μh), evaluated using Child's law in the SCLC region,16 increases upon PFAS modification. Enhancement of μh is actually expected for the highly textured pentacene film deposited on the PEDOT:PSS/PFAS substrates, as observed from the AFM studies (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, the hole only device with PFAS treatment shows SCLC characteristics under lower bias voltage, which also implies better crystallization and fewer grain boundaries of the pentacene layer. Inevitably, the pentacene film on PEDOT:PSS/PFAS with higher carrier mobility could contribute to higher exciton dissociations,17 if compared with that deposited on the pristine PEDOT:PSS.

Device performance
Effect of PFAS concentration
To investigate the influence of the PFAS interlayer on the device performance, the concentration of PFAS solution (in chlorobenzene) was varied from 0.1% to 0.9% by volume. The J–V characteristics of the photovoltaic cells are shown in Fig. 4a. The results are further detailed in Table 2.

Interestingly, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) (η %) of the OSCs has been improved significantly from 0.94% to 1.38% by PFAS modification. Such enhancement (of ∼46.8%) was contributed to, as observed from Table 2, by the increase in the short-circuit current (Jsc) from 6.4 mA cm−2 to 8.19 mA cm−2, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) from 0.29 V to 0.33 V, and the shunt resistance (Rsh) from 0.9 kΩ to 1.3 kΩ. As observed from the J–V measurements in dark conditions (Fig. 4b), the increase in Voc should be attributed to the suppression of leakage current induced by the insertion of PFAS buffer layers. It is also seen that Jsc first increases with increasing concentration of the PFAS solution but then decreases again, indicating a maximum PCE of 1.38% for the OSCs with a PFAS (0.5%) modified anode layer. The degradation of the device performance for higher concentrations of PFAS could probably be attributed to the increase in the barrier due to the increasing silanol thickness.
Although no obvious change in the absorption spectrum (Fig. S3†) could be observed for PFAS modified OSCs, the EQE spectra (Fig. 4c) exhibited significant differences between the OSCs with and without PFAS modification. The enhancement of the photocurrent upon PFAS modification, as observed in Fig. 4a, should be attributed to the efficient charge separation phenomena.9,18 Inevitably, for the pentacene film deposited on the PFAS modified PEDOT:PSS substrate, the highly textured and vertically grown 3D crystalline domains with solely dendritic-like structure would possess high μh, and hence could contribute to the significant enhancement in the Rsh and Jsc values, indicating the improvement of the electron–hole separation efficiency. On the other hand, the pentacene layer on the pristine PEDOT:PSS surface, without PFAS modification, has large grain sizes and fewer grain boundary defects but a high content of fiber-like disordered domains, giving rise to increased electron–hole recombination,19 and thus resulting in the decrease in μh and consequently to the loss in photocurrent.
Effect of thermal annealing
Post-annealing treatment has been found to effectively improve OSC efficiency in some earlier studies,20,1 presumably due to the improved crystallinity and reduced traps/defects9 or the substrate influence.21 However, the mechanisms behind the enhanced photon conversion are complicated and still not well understood. In general, it was ascribed to the increase in the Rsh and the built-in potential across the overall devices.22
To investigate the influences of the thermal annealing effect, the photovoltaic devices were subjected to thermal treatment at various temperatures from 120 to 200 °C. The post-annealing device performances are presented in Fig. 5a (without) and Fig. 5b (with PFAS modification), and are further detailed in Table 3. For the standard device structures, the PCE could be improved from 0.88% to 1.13% (∼28.5% enhancement), by thermal treatment (Fig. 5a). Such enhancement was mainly contributed to by the increase in Voc, Rsh, and Jsc as seen in Table 3. For the post-annealed PFAS modified OSCs, Fig. 5b shows that the PCE could be enhanced by 30% (from 1.33% to 1.73%) compared to the unannealed one. Notably, after thermal treatment, the PFAS modified photovoltaic cells could achieve a ∼96.6% enhancement in PCE (1.73%) compared to the unmodified standard OSCs (without thermal treatment, 0.88%).

The results (Table 3) show that with an increase in the annealing temperature, both Voc and Rsh increased significantly. The standard OSCs, without PFAS modification and without thermal annealing, exhibited a Voc value of only 0.29 V. However, after the insertion of the PFAS layer followed by thermal annealing, the Voc increased up to 0.45 V. Similarly, Rsh is also significantly improved from 1.9 kΩ to 4.8 kΩ. The J–V characteristics of the devices measured in dark conditions suggested that the increase in Voc should be attributed to the reduction of dark current with the increasing annealing temperature. Such a trend could be observed for both the device structures, without and with PFAS buffer layers, as shown in Fig. 5c and d, respectively. This phenomenon has been observed previously and reported in the literature.9
Further investigation of the J–V characteristics, as illustrated in Fig. 6a, also revealed that the incorporation of the PFAS layer in the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/pentacene/C60/BCP/Al structure of the pentacene solar cell could lead to an increase in the built-in potential (Vbi) from 370 mV (for the unmodified and unannealed structure, black curve) to 450 mV (with PFAS modification and thermally annealed at 200 °C, blue curve). As previously reported, the accumulated negative charges of –CF− functional groups at the interface between the PEDOT:PSS/PFAS and pentacene layers could increase the internal electric field, and consequently improve the hole injection and electron blocking efficiency, and hence the hole transporting efficiency.23 Furthermore, it can be expected that, with thermal annealing treatment, the negative charges would be rearranged and further distributed uniformly at the PEDOT:PSS/PFAS/pentacene interface. Accordingly, the induced dipole moment could be anticipated as the consequence of the presence of negatively charged PFAS, which can be further confirmed by UPS measurements.24

The devices under investigation are the structures (1) without PFAS modification and without thermal annealing (black curves), (2) without PFAS modification but thermally treated at 200 °C (red curves), and (3) with PFAS (0.5%) modification and thermally annealed at 200 °C (blue curves). (b) UPS data for the PEDOT:PSS layer with (red line) and without (black line) PFAS (0.5%) modification. The inset illustrates the proposed band diagram of the PFAS (0.5%) modified device. (c) Schematic illustrating the dipole moments induced on the PEDOT:PSS layer. 
From the UPS results (Fig. 6b), it can be clearly observed that the high binding-energy cutoff position shifted towards lower energy as the PFAS buffer layer was deposited on the PEDOT:PSS surface. Such a shift suggested that the –CF− functional groups of PFAS induced the dipole moments on the surface of the PEDOT:PSS layer (as shown in Fig. 6c), which in turn could result in the increase in Vbi across the devices,22 as revealed in Fig. 6a. Hence, it can be concluded that the improvement in the PCE by either the PFAS modification or the post-annealing treatment can definitely be partially credited to the enhancement in Vbi.
Issue with high temperature annealing
Interestingly, it was found that Jsc and the PCE increased initially but decreased at higher annealing temperatures as shown in Table 3. The results revealed that the maximum PCE was achieved with annealing at 180 and 150 °C, for the pentacene-based OSCs with and without PFAS modification, respectively. In order to investigate this issue, it is necessary to focus on the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 7a and b) in the following discussion.
 Fig. 7  The IPCE spectra of pentacene based OSCs (a) without and (b) with PFAS (0.5%) modification. Corresponding AFM topographies of pentacene resulted from thermal annealing at high temperature are illustrated in (c) and (d). The thickness of the pentacene film was maintained at 40 nm. 
Generally, in an IPCE spectrum of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/pentacene/C60/BCP/Al OSC devices, the signal within the wavelength ranging from 400 nm to 500 nm has been assigned to the C60 absorption, and that from 550 nm to 700 nm to the pentacene absorption. Notably, both devices, without (Fig. 7a) and with (Fig. 7b) PFAS modification, exhibited a similar trend in the IPCE spectra: with the increase in annealing temperature, the increase of IPCE was mainly contributed to by the C60, while in the pentacene absorption range the photocurrent decreases continuously. Most likely, the decrease of photocurrent of pentacene arises from the temperature-induced degradation of the pentacene film. For both unmodified (Fig. 7c) and modified (Fig. 7d) PEDOT:PSS substrates, the AFM images revealed serious degradation of the pentacene film with the appearance of numerous void areas in-between the dendrite-like structures, as the annealing temperature rises to 180 °C. The AFM results (also see Fig. S4†) are quite consistent with the dramatic decrease in photocurrent observed in the IPCE spectra, and the decreasing trend of Jsc, at high annealing temperature.
Nevertheless, it should be noted that the detrimental effects of temperature on the pentacene film and the device performances were less evident after PFAS-modification. Undoubtedly, the low surface energy of the PFAS-modified substrates and their weaker bonding with the pentacene molecules hinder the temperature-induced motion of the pentacene molecules on the surface. Consequently, the void zones are less observable for the pentacene deposited on the PEDOT:PSS/PFAS surface. The high temperature tolerance of PEDOT:PSS/PFAS allows for a higher annealing temperature, which further enhances the performance of the OSCs.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates a simple and effective approach to changing the molecular orientation in an organic electronic device by surface modification using fluorine-containing molecules such as PFAS. This technique can be generally applied in organic semiconductors to enhance their performance as demonstrated in the case of the PEDOT:PSS/PFAS/pentacene OSC. A detailed investigation has been made to understand the mechanisms for the improvement in Jsc, Voc, Rs, Rsh, and temperature tolerance of this device. Up to ∼96.6% enhancement has been demonstrated after PFAS modification and thermal annealing, which can be attributed to the achievement of the highly textured dendritic-like crystalline structures of pentacene. This technique can be further implemented into other organic semiconductor devices.
