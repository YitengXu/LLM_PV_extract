To address this, here we implant the top-illuminated devices on 1.3 μm polyimide substrates and demonstrate ultra-flexible OPVs with tunable colors, record efficiency and power densities, via delicate design of device configurations and selection of fabrication processes. Specifically, the optimized morphology of a transparent Ag electrode and the optical interference effect are utilized to improve the photovoltaic performances and realize a wide color gamut, respectively. Thus, the corresponding devices achieve a benchmark efficiency of 17.32%, and this efficiency remains almost unchanged after peel-off processing and 5000 compression–release deformation cycles. Encouragingly, the obtained ultra-thin OPVs exhibit an excellent power-to-weight ratio of 39.72 W g−1, which is the best value among all PV technologies. These results prove that our OPVs have outstanding adaptivity to be diversified for extreme application scenarios.

Broader context
Developing more adaptive photovoltaic (PV) technologies that can be assimilated into our daily life more harmoniously is an ideal way to harness solar energy, which requires the solar cells themselves to have the merits of high-performance, ultra-flexibility, vivid color, light-weight, good up-scalability, and low-cost production with solution-processability. However, the current PV technologies can hardly fulfill these requirements except for organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Here we implant the top-illuminated devices on 1.3 μm polyimide substrates and demonstrate ultra-flexible OPVs with tunable colors, and record efficiency and power densities, via delicate design of device configurations and selection of fabrication processes. The corresponding devices achieve a benchmark efficiency of 17.32%, and this efficiency remains almost unchanged after peel-off processing and 5000 compression–release deformation cycles. Encouragingly, the obtained ultra-flexible OPVs exhibit an excellent power-to-weight ratio of 39.72 W g−1, which is the best of all PV technologies. Our work demonstrates a very promising OPV structure for practical applications, and should pave the way toward high-performance OPVs of low-cost, visual aesthetics, ultra-flexibility, and good up-scaling capacity, with ease of integration.

Introduction
Solar cell technology powers our society in a rapidly increasing proportion, mainly through placing solar panels in rural places and connecting them to utilities with complex grids.1,2 This rigid form of solar energy utilization limits it for broad applications, and thus, developing more adaptive photovoltaic (PV) technologies that can be assimilated into human daily life more harmoniously is better way to harness solar energy.3 This requires solar cells with the merits of ultra-flexibility, vivid color, light-weight, good transparency, and low-cost production with solution-processability. Among all current PV technologies, only organic photovoltaics (OPVs) can fulfill these requirements simultaneously.4,5
With the fast evolution in photo-active materials and device architecture designs, the performance of OPVs, which is one of their major shortcomings compared to their counterparts, has continued to soar in recent years.6–20 To date, the highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OPVs have reached as high as 19.76% and 20.2% for single-junction and tandem devices, respectively, which can basically meet the commercialization threshold of the photovoltaic industry.21,22 Although OPVs can potentially be more flexible and adaptive for future applications, the present high-performance device is realized with a brittle and expensive indium tin oxide (ITO)-glass substrate, which removes most of OPVs’ merits. Therefore, the development of high-efficiency OPVs is urgently required, and full use of their advantages should be achieved to demonstrate OPVs with multi-functionalities for more diverse applications, e.g. self-powered electronic devices, building or vehicle-integration, space technology, etc.15,23–25 This requires systematic optimization of the substrate, transparent electrodes, active layers, interfaces, and device structures for OPVs with the desirable mechanical and optoelectronic properties.26
To bypass the disadvantages of ITO transparent electrodes, a variety of transparent electrodes, e.g. metal nanowires (NWs), metal grid mesh, ultra-thin metals, graphene, carbon nanotubes, conducting polymers, etc., have been developed.27–32 Among them, ultra-thin metal film-based transparent electrodes featuring low costs, high conductivity and strong light trapping have been widely explored, and enable superior flexibility and up-scalability for OPVs.32–35 For high-quality ultra-thin metal transparent electrodes, controlling their morphologies to be as smooth as possible is key. To reach this goal, several strategies, e.g. seed layers, modification layers, or doping materials, are introduced.36 Notably, during the selection of the appropriate seeding or modification layer for OPVs, their effects on both the transmittance and work function (WF) of the transparent electrode should be taken into consideration.
The vivid color of organic semiconductors and their multiple-layer structure intrinsically enables the development of colorful devices with aesthetic perception.37,38 However, most of the current mainstream inorganic PV technologies are dull in color, and it is therefore difficult to achieve aesthetic appreciation, and their application scenarios are relatively limited. In the meantime, in the top-illuminated structure, the optical microcavity between the bottom Ag electrode and the top ultra-thin Ag transparent electrode is beneficial for fabricating colorful OPVs.39 By controlling the optical interference effect, colorful OPVs with a simple structure, high repeatability, and good universality are easily obtained.
Furthermore, the inherent light-weight merit of OPVs is a huge advantage over other PV technologies, but is usually not reflected in conventional rigid/flexible OPV devices because the thick glass/plastic substrates add many unnecessary loads to OPVs.31 Prominently, building OPVs on ultra-thin substrates is a very effective route to broaden the applications of OPVs, since the total thickness of less than 10 μm can grant the devices with ultra-flexible and ultra-lightweight characteristics to meet the requirements of different scenarios and even some extreme environments.23,40–47 For example, ultra-thin OPVs (also known as ultra-flexible OPVs) can conglutinate to the surface of any shape, in favor of integration into the internet of things.42 In addition, their uses in the fields of aeronautics and astronautics are also imagined. If we attach ultra-flexible OPVs on the wings of an unmanned aerial vehicle (drone) with little added weight, it is expected to increase extra flight time. Very recently, Xiong et al. reported an ultra-flexible OPV with a PCE of 15.8%, and the device showed a power-to-weight ratio of 33.8 W g−1.43 On the one hand, ultra-flexible OPVs may face extreme bending conditions during operation, e.g. an extraordinary small bending radius of 20 μm, which requires the electrodes to have superior mechanical flexibility.46 On the other hand, the fabrication process of ultra-flexible OPVs is often more challenging, partly because of easily wrinkled ultra-thin substrates.44 Therefore, the efficiency of ultra-flexible OPVs is still lagging behind conventional flexible ones.
In this work, we demonstrate top-illuminated OPVs with high performance, tunable colors and ultra-flexibility, via delicate device structure design and optical tuning. First, by optimizing an Ag transparent electrode via wetting and seeding effects, the corresponding ITO-free rigid OPVs exhibit a high efficiency of 17.50%, and moreover, this performance can be mostly transferred to the up-scaled 1.00 cm2 OPVs (17.20%). Second, the optical microcavity between the bottom Ag electrode and the top Au/Ag transparent electrode enables fabrication of colorful OPVs, and thus, a series of colorful OPVs are achieved by controlling the optical interference effect. Third, for the first time, we have successfully implanted colorful ultra-flexible OPVs on 1.3 μm polyimide (PI) substrates, and realized PCEs of 17.32% and 17.08% for 0.052 cm2 and 1.00 cm2 devices, respectively, which represent the best results of ultra-flexible OPVs. Interestingly, the ultra-flexible OPVs retain 97% PCE during 5000 continuous compression-release deformation cycles with a compression ratio of 30% (radius of 20 μm). In particular, the devices exhibit an excellent power-to-weight ratio of 39.72 W g−1 at a weight of 4.36 g m−2, which is also the highest value for all PV technologies.
Results and discussion
Top-illuminated structure

Fig. 1(a) shows the top-illuminated structure based on ultra-thin Ag as a transparent electrode (termed as TUA) of this work, and here we endeavor to systematically optimize the device by choosing photo-active layers, interfacial layers, and transparent electrodes to achieve a high performance. Among them, PCP-2F-Li is an interfacial layer that can effectively connect the Ag electrode and the hole-transporting layer of PEDOT:PSS for high performance (see the ESI,† Fig. S1).48 PM6:L8-BO is an efficient active layer chosen from the reported literature (Fig. 1(b)).13 Bis-FIMG is an excellent electron-transporting layer developed in our laboratory, that has been widely used in organic as well as perovskite solar cells (Fig. 1(c)).49

(d) J–V characteristics and (e) EQE spectra of TUA-based devices with different ultra-thin Ag thicknesses. 
The strong reflectivity of the ultra-thin metal electrodes and the strong optical microcavity efficiency within the device chamber make the light trapping of the TUA-based devices very sensitive to the thickness of each layer. Therefore, before fabricating TUA devices, we performed optical simulations of the thicknesses of the active layer, anti-reflection TeO2, and ultra-thin Ag to optimize the device configuration (as shown in Fig. S2–S4, ESI†). Guided by optical simulations, we selected a 90 nm active layer and ∼50 nm TeO2 to fabricate small-area TUA devices with ultra-thin Ag thicknesses of 9, 11, and 13 nm, and the J–V and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are shown in Fig. 1(d) and (e), with device parameters summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Among them, the 11 nm ultra-thin Ag TUA device exhibits the best PCE of 17.02%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.870 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 24.97 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 78.34%.
The TUA device performance with 9 nm ultra-thin Ag exhibits the opposite trend from the optical simulations, which is mainly derived from the decline of JSC and FF. With the thickness of ultra-thin Ag reducing (e.g., <10 nm), the ultra-thin Ag film becomes discontinuous, and this will decrease its transmittance due to the scattering effect and increase its sheet resistance (as shown in Fig. S5a and b, ESI†), which will decrease the JSC and FF of OPVs.36 For OPV devices, it is desirable that the transparent electrodes have as low a resistance and as high a transmittance as possible. From the simulation results shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), we find the thinner Ag layer will benefit the charge generation, due to the high transmission and low reflection. We simulated the optical microcavity inside the device chambers and the EQE spectra (by assuming 100% internal quantum efficiency, as shown in Fig. S7, ESI†) with 9 nm and 11 nm ultra-thin Ag films as the transparent electrodes, and the results show that the 9 nm ultra-thin Ag-based device has a stronger optical field distribution and a higher EQE response than the 11 nm one. However, the most challenging part when using a thin Ag transparent electrode lies in the film quality, which tends to follow a nucleation-growth mechanism at a heterogeneous interface, and leads to an inhomogeneous film with a high threshold thickness becoming a continuous film.36 Therefore, obtaining ultra-thin (<10 nm) transparent electrodes with a continuous conducting network and low defect density is crucial to further improve the performance of TUA OPVs.
Interface engineering
The interfaces within the device play a major role in determining the growth mode and morphology of ultra-thin Ag, as well as its conductivity and mechanical properties.36 Herein, different electron-transporting layers (ETLs), i.e. PFN-Br, PDINO, and Bis-FIMG have been explored as the substrates of ultra-thin Ag films. The chemical structures of different ETLs are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). First, we investigated the effect of ETLs on the morphology of ultra-thin Ag by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 2(a) and Fig. S9, ESI†) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. 2(b)). As shown, 9 nm Ag on the PFN-Br substrate exhibits a very rough morphology and the film exhibits a discontinuous state, while the ultra-thin Ag films on PDINO and Bis-FIMG substrates are much smoother, which is attributed to the strong interaction of Ag–O and Ag–I. Furthermore, a seeding strategy, adopting 1 nm Au as the templating layer, is used to further improve the growth of ultra-thin Ag, and obtain the smoothest and most uniform ultra-thin Ag film. The structure of Glass/ETLs/(Au/)Ag/TeO2 (as shown in Fig. 2(c)) is used to study the effect of ETLs on the optical and electrical properties of transparent electrodes. As shown in Fig. 2(d) and (e), due to the improved morphology of ultra-thin Ag, the transparent electrode with Au as the seed layer shows the lowest sheet resistance of 7.2 Ω sq−1 and the highest transmittance of 93.8% at 580 nm. It can also be confirmed through the authentic pictures of various transparent electrodes (Fig. 2(f)) that the transparent electrode with Au as the seed layer exhibits the best transparency. The reasons for using 1 nm Au as a seed layer are as follows: First, the surface energy of metals is usually much higher than that of organic molecules. When high surface energy metals (Au, Ag) are deposited on low surface energy organic molecules (Bis-FIMG), the growth mode of metal films tends to be the Volmer–Weber mode (3D island growth). Therefore, both Au and Ag films tend to form 3D island structures on Bis-FIMG. However, as shown in the Fig. S10 (ESI†), the 3D islands of the 1 nm Au on the Bis-FIMG are significantly smaller than those of the 1 nm Ag due to the interaction between Au–O and Au–I being stronger than Ag–O and Ag–I,50 which will provide a higher nucleation density for the growth of ultra-thin Ag films and make the Ag films more uniform. Second, at the same time, since the surface energy of Au is higher than that of Ag (1.5 J m−2vs. 1.25 J m−2), when the ultra-thin Ag films are deposited on the Au seed layer, the growth mode of ultra-thin Ag will be transformed into a Frank-van der Merwe mechanism (layer by layer growth).36 Therefore, a 1 nm Au seed layer will greatly improve the quality of ultra-thin Ag films.

(g) J–V characteristics and (h) EQE spectra of TUA-based devices with various transparent electrodes. 
Subsequently, we fabricated TUA-based devices to study the effect of different ETLs on photovoltaic performances with a thinner Ag layer (∼9 nm). As shown in Fig. 2(g)–(h) and Table S2 (ESI†), the TUA device with PFN-Br as the ETL exhibits a poor device performance, i.e. the PCE of 10.20% with a VOC of 0.767 V, a JSC of 21.03 mA cm−2, and a FF of 63.22%. Due to the improved transmittance of ultra-thin Ag, the PCE of the PDINO-based device increases to 11.02% (with a VOC of 0.795 V, a JSC of 23.91 mA cm−2, and a FF of 59.19%), but is still at a low performance. For the device with Bis-FIMG as the ETL, the improved ultra-thin Ag morphology and the ability to tune the electrode WF successfully enable the Bis-FIMG-based device to achieve a PCE of 16.35%, with a VOC of 0.869 V, a JSC of 24.59 mA cm−2, and a FF of 76.45%. This is still inferior to the device with 11 nm Ag. However, after modifying ultra-thin Ag with Au as a seed layer, the PCE of the Bis-FIMG/Au/Ag-based device increased dramatically to 17.50%, with a VOC of 0.870 V, a JSC of 25.52 mA cm−2, and a FF of 78.87%, surpassing OPV with 11 nm Ag. Furthermore, the PCE of the 1 cm2 rigid large-area device based on Bis-FIMG/Au/Ag also reached 17.20%, which represents the highest efficiency of large-area ITO-free OPVs. The variation in device performance confirms that the WF and transparent electrode morphology-tuning ability of ETL has a significant impact on the performance of OPVs.
Aesthetic OPVs
One attractive advantage of the top-illuminated structure is that the color of the device can be simply adjusted by varying the thickness of the anti-reflection layer, owing to the strong optical reflection of ultra-thin Ag. Therefore, the visual aesthetic of our designed OPVs was explored. As shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), the Au/Ag/TeO2 transparent electrodes with different light transmittances were obtained by adjusting the thickness of TeO2. Then, we fabricated rigid TUA devices based on 0–75 nm TeO2. For a better visual comparison, the photovoltaic characteristics curves of 0 nm, 35 nm, 45 nm, 55 nm and 65 nm TeO2-based OPV devices are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), and the device parameters are summarized in Table 1. Due to similar optical interference effects, the photovoltaic characteristics curves of 15 nm, 25 nm and 75 nm TeO2-based OPV devices are shown in Fig. S12a (ESI†), and the device parameters are summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). The difference in device performance is mainly due to the change in JSC caused by the different thickness of TeO2. Fig. 3(d) shows the optical simulation results of the active layer and TeO2 thickness-dependent JSC of TUA-based OPV, with the ultra-thin Ag thickness fixed at 11 nm. The variation trend of JSC is consistent with optical simulation and EQE results: the JSC first increases with TeO2, and reaches the maximum at 50–60 nm. The different thicknesses of TeO2 change the reflectivity of the devices (Fig. 3(c)), delivering different colors for the TUA-OPVs. As shown in Table 1, the colors of the 0 nm, 35 nm, 45 nm, 55 nm and 65 nm TeO2-based OPV devices are displayed as brown, rose-red, purple, blue and green. The reflectance spectra of 15 nm, 25 nm and 75 nm TeO2-based OPV devices are shown in Fig. S12b (ESI†), and the corresponding device colors are shown in Table S4 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3(e), we verify that the device colors observed by the naked eye or camera are consistent with those obtained by calculating the color coordinates (CIE 1931) of the measured reflection spectra. We also simulated the reflection spectra of the corresponding devices (Fig. S13, ESI†), and the results conform to the experimental curves. However, it should be noted that there is a deviation between the color coordinates corresponding to the simulation results and the experimental results, which is due to: first, the simulation results are based on a smooth surface, while the actual film surface is relatively rough; second, the interface of each layer of material will penetrate each other, which will affect the optical interference of the device. These synergistic effects lead to spectral shifts in practical devices, as shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†). We have fabricated a series of colorful devices with TeO2 thicknesses from 0–75 nm, as shown in Fig. 3(f), and these results demonstrate the accessible color tunability of our top-illuminated OPVs. Furthermore, to show the power of the color-tunable OPVs for decorating our daily life, we have intercepted the colors of the devices with a color picker and formed colorful words of “Zhejiang University”, which showed the colorful characteristics of the TUA devices in a more intuitive way.

Ultra-flexible OPVs
Flexibility is considered to be the most prominent feature to enable the commercialization of OPVs.31 Here, we have transplanted the TUA devices on the PI substrate (the chemical structure of PI as shown in Fig. S15, ESI†) with a thickness of 125 μm due to its good mechanical properties and thermal stability, and the 0.052 cm2 and 1.00 cm2 flexible TUA devices exhibit high PCEs of 17.40% and 17.17%, respectively. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of 125 μm PI substrate-based flexible OPVs are shown in Fig. S16, ESI† and Table 2. In the meantime, we find that the flexible OPV can survive the bending test with a radius of 2 mm for 5000 cycles, without any degradation in device efficiency, as shown in Fig. S17, S18 and Table S3 (ESI†). Reducing the thickness of the flexible devices to the micrometer scale can result in lighter weight and better flexibility, which can open up more application scenarios for OPVs. Since the ultra-thin Ag transparent electrode exhibits superior mechanical flexibility,32 we have further fabricated ultra-flexible TUA devices on 1.3 μm PI substrates for the first time. The corresponding J–V characteristics of small-area ultra-flexible TUA devices are depicted in Fig. 4(a), and Table 2 summarizes the corresponding device parameters. The 0.052 cm2 ultra-flexible TUA device exhibits a record PCE of 17.32%, with a VOC of 0.869 V, a JSC of 25.54 mA cm−2, and a FF of 78.04%, which is the best result for ultra-flexible OPVs (statistical data as shown in Fig. 4(b) and Table S6, ESI†). Unfortunately, due to the limitations of flexible encapsulating conditions and top-illuminated structures, we have not obtained a third-party efficiency certification. Then, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(a), we peeled the ultra-flexible device from the glass substrate to obtain the “freestanding OPVs”, which takes advantage of the easy attachment of ultra-flexible OPVs to substrates of arbitrary shapes. As shown, the freestanding OPVs exhibit a slight drop in PCE of 16.92%, which proved the reliability of the TUA device structure. In addition, as shown in Fig. S19 (ESI†), the 1 cm2 large-area ultra-flexible OPV is also fabricated on 1.3 μm PI substrate, with a PCE of 17.08%, which is comparable to those of the 1 cm2 reference devices on glass and 125 μm PI substrates. This validates the up-scaling potential of our designed ultra-flexible OPVs.

Furthermore, a mechanical durability test has been carried out with compression-stretching cycles. As shown in Fig. 4(d), when the ultra-flexible OPV was compressed by 30%, the OPV was wrinkled with a bending radius of about 20 μm, which stands for the most severe standard for flexible OPVs. As shown in Fig. 4(c) and Fig. S20 (ESI†), the ultra-thin OPV showed 97% PCE retention after 5000 compression-stretching cycles with 30% compression, and details of the photovoltaic parameters are provided in Table S5 (ESI†). The main reason for the decrease in efficiency is that the deformation of the substrate during the compression process leads to an irreversible reduction in the device area, resulting in a decay in JSC, while the VOC and FF remain almost unchanged, and this result demonstrates the superiority of the TUA structure for ultra-flexible OPVs. As the thickness of the PI substrate is reduced to 1.3 μm, the ultra-flexible device also exhibits an ultra-lightweight feature. As shown in Fig. S21 and S22 (ESI†), the weight of five ultra-flexible OPVs with 1.5 cm by 1.5 cm sizes is only 3.27 mg, which corresponds to a weight of 4.36 g and a maximum power of 173.2 W for a 1 m2 device (the theoretical maximum value will inevitably decrease in practical applications). Thus, the ultra-flexible OPVs yield an excellent power-to-weight ratio of 39.72 W g−1, which is the best result among all PV technologies (statistical data as shown in Fig. 4(e) and Table S7, ESI†).43,51–53 As shown in supplementary movie (ESI†), we demonstrate the weighing process of a 1.5 × 1.5 cm ultra-thin OPVs. To better demonstrate the ultra-lightweight characteristics, we put the ultra-flexible OPVs on a crown of the dandelion and on a single human hair, as shown in Fig. 4(f) and Fig. S23 (ESI†), and the dandelion and hair can support the devices well without deformation. In addition, ultra-lightweight and ultra-flexible OPVs can be attached to any shape. As shown in Fig. S24 (ESI†), we attach the ultra-flexible OPV to concave, convex, and irregular surfaces to suit the needs of future practical applications. Then, we made a wearable display of ultra-flexible OPV devices with different colors on the wrist, and the letters “Z”, “J”, and “U” (deposits of 35 nm, 55 nm, and 65 nm TeO2) were displayed in red, blue and green, respectively (Fig. 4(g)). Furthermore, the commercial application of OPV devices requires the material costs to be reduced as much as possible, and the development of ultra-thin OPVs will further reduce the cost of raw materials. As shown in Fig. S25, S26a and Tables S8 and S9 (ESI†), as an example in our lab we fabricated a 10 cm by 10 cm sized flexible OPV device (the effective area is 72 cm2) using a blade coating process, and analysed the cost of ITO and ITO-free (Au/Ag) electrode-based devices. For ITO-based devices, the cost of a 10 cm by 10 cm sized PI/ITO electrode accounts for 60% of the production cost of the entire OPV device, resulting in ITO-based flexible OPV costs as high as 152 Chinese Yuan (¥). Impressively, for Au/Ag-based devices, the cost of PI and transparent electrodes of the corresponding size accounts for only 11% of the production cost of the entire OPV device. As a result, the cost of a piece of flexible OPV based on Au/Ag as a transparent electrode is only 72 ¥. At the same time, to more clearly demonstrate the cost advantage of Au/Ag electrodes, we calculated the cost per watt of flexible OPV devices produced in the laboratory (as shown in Fig. S26b, ESI†). The results show that it costs 82 ¥ to produce one watt of ITO-based devices, while Au/Ag-based devices only cost 42 ¥. These vivid examples prove that the use of Au/Ag electrodes will save more than 50% of the production cost, which will be very beneficial to the commercial development of OPVs. Of course, the above cost analysis is limited to the laboratory scale. When the production scale is expanded, the purchase price of raw materials will drop significantly, but the proportion of the material cost will not change much. In addition, we try to make a design in which Au/Ag electrode is replaced with ITO electrode, which may theoretically create a higher efficiency and power density due to the advantage of ITO transmittance. However, considering that the sputtering process of ITO will destroy the organic active layer, we expect that ITO as the top electrode will lead to a sharp drop in device performance in practical situations. The advantages of ultra-flexibility, ultra-lightweight, low-cost and color-tunability will facilitate the commercialization of TUA-OPV devices because of more artistic and severe application scenarios beyond the limits of other PV technologies.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed an OPV device with an ultra-thin Ag transparent electrode and a top-illumination structure, and demonstrate an OPV device simultaneously delivering the merits of high-performance, ultra-flexibility, ultra-lightweight, low-cost, and color-tunability. For the first time, we have implanted the top-illuminated device on an ultra-thin substrate (1.3 micro-meter) to fabricate ultra-flexible OPVs, and we demonstrated the ultra-flexible OPVs with tunable colors, a record efficiency and power densities, via the wetting method and optical interference effect. This enables the ultra-flexible OPVs to show benchmark PCEs of 17.32% for 0.052 cm2 and 17.08% for 1.00 cm2, and the corresponding devices show a 97% PCE retention rate after the 5000 compression–release deformation cycles. Furthermore, the designed ultra-flexible OPVs exhibit an excellent power-to-weight ratio of 39.72 W g−1, which is the best result among all PV technologies. Therefore, our work demonstrates a very promising OPV structure for practical applications, and should pave the way toward high-performance OPVs with low-cost, visual aesthetics, ultra-flexibility, and good up-scaling capacity, with ease of integration.
Experimental
Materials
PEDOT:PSS (AI4083) was purchased from Baytron. PM6 and L8-BO were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. PCP-2F-Li and Bis-FIMG were synthesized according to previously reported literature.48,49 Au and Ag were purchased from Zhongnuo New Materials Inc. TeO2 was purchased from J&K Scientific Inc. The PI precursor was purchased from Yijia Polymer & Chemicals Inc. All reagents and solvents were used directly if not otherwise specified.
Rigid TUA-based device fabrication
For rigid TUA-based devices, 100 nm-thick Ag was deposited by thermal evaporation on glass substrates as the bottom electrode, then a 5 nm thick PCP-2F-Li film was deposited as the anode buffer connection layer by spin-coating a solution of 1 mg mL−1 in methanol. Then, a 20 nm thick PEDOT:PSS film was deposited as the anode buffer layer by spin-coating at 4500 rpm. After baking the PEDOT:PSS layer in air at 150 °C for 15 min, the substrates were transferred into a glovebox. PM6:L8-BO (1:1.2, weight ratio) in a 16 mg mL−1 chloroform:DIO (99.75:0.25, by volume) solution was spin-coated at 2500 rpm for 30 s, followed by thermal annealing at 80 °C for 5 min, and the thickness of the active layer is around 80 nm. Then a 10 nm Bis-FIMG film was deposited as the cathode buffer layer by the spin-coating of a solution of 1 mg mL−1 in methanol. Then, 1 nm-thick Au and 8 nm-thick Ag films were deposited by thermal evaporation as the top electrode with an active area of 0.052 cm2 and 1.00 cm2. Finally, 35–65 nm-thick TeO2 capping layers were deposited on top of the ultra-thin Ag to further improve the light-absorbing capability and exhibit different device colors.
Flexible and ultra-flexible TUA-based device fabrication
For flexible TUA-based devices, the 125 μm-thick PI substrates were adhered onto PDMS-coated glass substrates, then the 100 nm-thick Ag electrode, PCP-2F-Li, PEDOT:PSS, active layer, Bis-FIMG, 9 nm-thick Au/Ag transparent electrode, and TeO2 were respectively deposited according to the above methods. For ultra-flexible TUA-based devices, first, the glass substrates were treated with an ultraviolet ozone generator for 15 min. Then, the fluorinated polymer layer (Novec 1700:7100 = 1:8) was spin-coated onto the glass at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by thermal annealing at 80 °C for 10 min. Before spin coating the PI precursor, the glass/fluorinated polymer layer was treated with an ultraviolet ozone generator for 2 min. Then, the PI precursor was spin-coated on the substrate at 8000 rpm for 30 s, followed by thermal annealing at 250 °C for 2 hours to form a 1.3 μm-thick PI substrate (the number average molecular weight of PI after curing is about 5000). Then, the 100 nm-thick Ag electrode, PCP-2F-Li, PEDOT:PSS, active layer, Bis-FIMG, 9 nm-thick Au/Ag transparent electrode, and TeO2 were respectively deposited according to the above methods.
Characterization of films and devices

J–V measurements were performed via the solar simulator (SS-X50, Enlitech) along with AM 1.5G spectra whose intensity was calibrated using a certified standard silicon solar cell (KG2, Enlitech) at 100 mV cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) data were obtained by using the solar-cell spectral-response measurement system (RE-R, Enlitech). The surface tension values of films were calculated through Fowkes approximation. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was carried out using a VeecoMultiMode AFM in tapping mode, and the scanning rate for a 1 μm × 1 μm image was 1.0 Hz. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained on an S-4800 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Cyclic bending and stretching testing was performed in a N2 glove-box using a mechanical tester (PR-BDM-H3, Puri, China).
Compression–stretching test
First, the ultra-flexible OPV device was transferred onto a 200% pre-stretched elastomer. The compression ratio of ultra-flexible OPVs is defined as ΔL/L0, where L0 is the initial length when the elastomer is pre-stretched, and ΔL is the change in length upon its release. An elastomer layer with a length of 20 mm was stretched to a length of 60 mm (L0). Then, ultra-thin OPVs were attached to the stretched elastomer. When the stretched elastomer was released to 42 mm, the ultra-thin OPVs were compressed by 30% (Fig. 4(c), illustration). The photovoltaic performance after compression–release cycling was determined when the devices recovered their initial shape.
Optical simulations
The refractive indices and thicknesses of the PCP-2F-Li and PM6:L8-BO coatings were measured using a dual rotating-compensator Mueller matrix ellipsometer (ME-L ellipsometer, Wuhan Eoptics Technology Co., Wuhan, China), and the optical index of other layers was taken from the literature (including the reference quoted for optical simulation).32,39 The index of refraction (ñ = n + ik) of each material was acquired by variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE-VM, Wuhan Eoptics Technology Co., Wuhan, China). The optical simulation was carried out by resolving the Maxwell equations using the transfer matrix method with matlab software as reported in previous work.32

Broader context
Developing more adaptive photovoltaic (PV) technologies that can be assimilated into our daily life more harmoniously is an ideal way to harness solar energy, which requires the solar cells themselves to have the merits of high-performance, ultra-flexibility, vivid color, light-weight, good up-scalability, and low-cost production with solution-processability. However, the current PV technologies can hardly fulfill these requirements except for organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Here we implant the top-illuminated devices on 1.3 μm polyimide substrates and demonstrate ultra-flexible OPVs with tunable colors, and record efficiency and power densities, via delicate design of device configurations and selection of fabrication processes. The corresponding devices achieve a benchmark efficiency of 17.32%, and this efficiency remains almost unchanged after peel-off processing and 5000 compression–release deformation cycles. Encouragingly, the obtained ultra-flexible OPVs exhibit an excellent power-to-weight ratio of 39.72 W g−1, which is the best of all PV technologies. Our work demonstrates a very promising OPV structure for practical applications, and should pave the way toward high-performance OPVs of low-cost, visual aesthetics, ultra-flexibility, and good up-scaling capacity, with ease of integration.
