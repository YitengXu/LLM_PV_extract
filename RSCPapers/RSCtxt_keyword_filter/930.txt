    , Accepted 24th December 2018First published on 3rd January 2019AbstractCrystalline silicon solar cells can achieve high power conversion efficiency and can be successfully commercialized; however, the exploration of optimization strategies is still necessary. Here, we demonstrated improved performance of a polycrystalline silicon solar cell by depositing Sb2Ox/CdO double layers onto a Si wafer via a low-cost route. The metal oxide layers, forming effective heterojunctions, suppressed carrier recombination and reduced surface reflection. Additionally, the heterojunctions of Sb2Ox/CdO/Si enhanced the transmission of electrons and holes and simultaneously, a wider response range in the solar spectrum was realized. The power conversion efficiency improved from 12.6 to 16.7% in a polycrystalline silicon solar cell, with relative increase of 33%. It is expected that the metal oxide-enhanced devices will have tremendous potential in commercial applications.
Introduction
Photovoltaic devices with high conversion efficiency, low cost and long-term stability are needed for their commercialization. Although many types of solar cells such as organic solar cells,1–3 dye-sensitized solar cells,4,5 quantum dot-sensitized solar cells6–8 and perovskite solar cells9–11 have been designed and developed, these new types of cells still suffer from issues such as low performance and the risk of instability, which hinder their mass production and further commercial applications. Over the last two decades, polycrystalline silicon (p-Si) solar cells have consistently achieved remarkable performance in power conversion efficiency (PCE), and they have dominated the photovoltaic market due to their abundant material resources, high carrier mobility, long-term stability, non-toxicity, and well-established manufacturing techniques.12–14 If the manufacturing of solar cells can be improved by utilizing inexpensive materials via a simple process, significant reduction in costs can be realized by mass production. Although studies on the manufacture of monocrystalline silicon solar cells and thin film silicon solar cells have been reported, their cost performance is still much lower than that of p-Si solar cells.15,16 A variety of photovoltaic devices combining silicon with other materials, such as carbon nanotubes,17–19 organic materials,2,20,21 graphene,22–24 and quantum dots7,8,25 have also been fabricated. However, the cost, conversion efficiency and long-term stability are still far from satisfactory.
Metal oxides have been reported in the new type of solar cells as a carrier transport layer or an antireflection layer, and these include titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, copper oxide, and stannic oxide.26–28 The application of metal oxides in silicon solar cells can also be successful. Antimony oxide (Sb2Ox) is extensively used in modern industry and laboratories because of its unique optical, electronic and optoelectronic properties.29,30 Meanwhile, cadmium oxide (CdO) possesses high optical transmittance and low electrical resistivity; thus, it has wide range of applications such as in phototransistors, photodiodes, IR detectors, and photovoltaic cells.31,32 In this study, CdO and Sb2Ox served as direct wide-bandgap semiconductors; they were synthesized on the top of p-Si solar cells via annealing their corresponding spin-coated acetate precursors Cd(OAc)2 and Sb(OAc). As reported in previous publications, the presence of multiple valence states of a metal ion indicates that oxygen defects exist.33,34 Therefore, interfacial reactions are detrimental to device performance.35 /Sb2Ox layers play multiple roles as antireflection and passivation layers in p-Si solar cells. At the same time, an effective structure of the cell can allow excellent matching of the energy levels of metal oxides, and the whole solar spectrum can be utilized at a greater scope. The power conversion efficiency of the p-Si solar cell improved from 12.6% to 16.7%, which was assisted by the CdO/Sb2Ox layers. The detailed mechanism of the multifunctional layers was also discussed.
Experimental section
Fabrication of CdO and Sb2Ox layers
Slices (4.0 × 4.0 cm2) of p-Si wafers without Si3N4 were obtained from Jiangsu Tianhe Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd and applied in our research. The wafer was 200 μm-thick with a bulk P–N junction, and the silicon resistivity was in the range of 1–10 Ω cm. A CdO nanoparticle (NP) layer was grown on the p-Si wafer through the chemical bath deposition method and rapid annealing treatment. The surface of the p-Si wafer was cleaned by rinsing with bi-distilled water and ethanol before deposition. Subsequently, the CdO NP layer was formed on the surface of the p-Si wafer by spin-assisted deposition methods. In this step, 0.1 mL of 0.05 M cadmium acetate (Cd(OAc)2) and deionized water solutions were dropped onto the p-Si surface under a speed of 1500 rpm for 60 s and recycled 5 times to ensure that the Cd-precursor fully covered the substrate. Then, the wafer was annealed at a certain temperature of about 350 °C for 10 min at the normal atmosphere to decompose Cd(OAc)2 into CdO. The Sb2Ox film was immediately deposited onto the substrate with the same method, using antimony(III) acetate (Sb(OAc)3) as the Sb cation source, 0.1 mL of 0.1 M Sb(OAc)3 ethylene glycol and ethanol solution (1:1). After spin coating, the wafer was annealed at 180 °C for 10 min to obtain improved crystallization.
Characterization
The surface morphology and structures of the devices were characterized using field-emission scanning electron microscopy [FESEM, S-4800 Hitachi]. The absorption and reflection spectra of the samples were measured using a UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Hitachi UH4150). The minority carrier lifetimes of the samples were characterized by Semilab WT-2000PVN. The back electrode of p-Si was Al, which was fabricated by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Ag grids serving as the front electrode were then screen-printed onto the surface, and the final step was rapid thermal annealing. The total cell area was measured to be 16 cm2. To perform photovoltaic testing, a solar simulator (Sun 2000 Abet Technologies, Inc.) was used to irradiate the devices under AM 1.5 conditions (100 mW cm−2), and the current-density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cell were measured using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium). The AM 1.5 conditions for the solar simulator were calibrated using a silicon standard cell (15150-KG5 Abet Technologies, Inc.). For the IPCE measurements, the solar cells were tested using a QTest Station (1000AD CROWNTECH, INC.). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI-5000, VersaProbe) was conducted by using a mono X-ray source and Al Kα excitation (1486.6 eV). Impedance measurements were performed by an external potentiostat (XPOT) of the electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) over a frequency range from 100 kHz down to 0.1 Hz at forward bias potentials between 0 and 0.5 V (with 5 mV sinusoidal AC perturbation). The resulting impedance spectra were analyzed with ZSipWin software (v3.10, EChem Software).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the silicon photovoltaic device configuration. In our research, a p-type silicon (Si)-wafer with thickness of 200 μm and resistivity of 5 Ω cm was used for solar cell fabrication. The wafer used was commercial p-Si after phosphorus diffusion and without the Si3N4 antireflection film. After short HF dip cleaning, the CdO NP layer and Sb2Ox layer were deposited on the emitter substrate.

The CdO NP layer was sandwiched between the Sb2Ox layer and the silicon substrate. After depositing these two oxide layers, a textured surface structure was formed on the top of the cell, which could be facilely tailored for efficient optical trapping. In addition, as we can see from Fig. 1(c), staggered gap heterojunctions are formed at the semiconductor interfaces, where the electrons and holes are inclined to spatially separate in various energy gradients. Since the conduction bands (CB) and valence bands (VB) of the metal oxides are different, when they come into contact with p-Si, the difference between the energy bands can cause them to bend, which is beneficial for electron collection. In this energy level structure, the electrons in Sb2Ox CB were injected into CdO CB and then flowed into Si CB, whereas the holes in Si VB were transferred to CdO VB and Sb2Ox VB successively.36 Due to the interface action between the metal oxides and the silicon substrate, the transmission of electrons and holes was effectively enhanced; simultaneously, more high-energy photons could be obtained and then converted into carriers on account of their wide bandgaps. Therefore, electron–hole recombination decreased effectively by the Sb2Ox/CdO/Si heterojunction, which increased the availability of the carriers to optimize photoelectric conversion. Furthermore, the Sb2Ox layer with unique optical and electrical properties not only yielded good chemical passivation by decreasing the interface defect density but also resulted in strong field effect passivation; this repelled the electrons or holes away from the surface, leading to the suppression of carrier recombination.
The p-Si solar cells without metal oxide coatings, as we can see in Fig. 2(a) and (b), exhibit a polished surface and become rough after the growth of the CdO NP layer, which can theoretically provide much stronger light scattering of the incident photons than the observations for bare surface. The surface morphologies are shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d) at two different magnifications. It can be observed that the nanoparticles of CdO are uniformly distributed on the surface of the wafer with an average size of 50 nm depending on the concentration of the precursor solution and deposition times. A textured surface structure is observed after the deposition of Sb2Ox, which is shown in Fig. 2(c). Fig. 2(d) shows a surface view of the p-Si solar cell with CdO/Sb2Ox layers. From the figures, we can see that Sb2Ox is evenly distributed between the CdO NP layer and the silicon substrate, which acts as the passivation and antireflection layer.

Benefitting from the rough interfaces between metal oxide layers and the silicon substrate as well as the subwavelength dimensions of the nanoparticles in the layer, the p-Si solar cell with metal oxide layers formed a gradient of the refractive index, which resulted in multiple scattering of the incident light and enhancement of absorption.37,38 Light only undergoes a gradual change of the refractive index instead of hitting a sharp interface because of the graded-refractive index layers and reflection of a large range of wavelengths can be efficiently eliminated.39
To further elucidate the antireflection effect of the metal oxide layers, the light absorption and reflectance spectra of p-Si solar cells with CdO NP layer, Sb2Ox layer and CdO/Sb2Ox layers are shown in Fig. 4a and b. The absorption spectra of the p-Si solar cell without any metal oxide layers are also provided for reference. Due to ∼3.44 eV bandgap, the Sb2Ox spectrum features a cut-off wavelength at 360 nm (the inset of Fig. 4a), whereas the p-Si solar cell integrated with the Sb2Ox layer shows large broadband light absorption enhancement compared to the reference one. From Fig. 4a, we can see that the slight enhancement for the sample with the single Sb2Ox layer or CdO layer is far from satisfactory. Instead, after depositing these two metal oxides, the optical absorption greatly increased in the wavelength range between 400 and 1000 nm. As a result of the broad bandgaps of CdO and Sb2Ox (∼2.43 eV and ∼3.44 eV), the spectrum of the composite cell features large broadband light absorption enhancement compared to that of the reference one. This increase results from the perfect cooperation between the two metal oxides and the specific structure of the bandgap. Among the solar spectra, high-energy photons are first absorbed by the Sb2Ox layer at the upper layer of the cell. Then, photons with energy less than 3.44 eV are absorbed by the CdO NP layer and Si substrate in turn. In addition, as shown in Fig. 4b, compared with a p-Si solar cell with a single CdO NP layer or single Sb2Ox layer, the cell with CdO/Sb2Ox layers exhibited lower reflectance and the reflectance decreased below 15% in the range from 600 to 1000 nm. This is because due to the deposited CdO and Sb2Ox layers, light is reflected repeatedly between the layers and the silicon substrate, thus reducing the loss of solar light.

Fig. 4c shows the comparison of incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) of p-Si solar cells without any metal oxide layer, with Sb2Ox layer, with CdO nanoparticles and with CdO/Sb2Ox layers. A large value of ∼75% is observed from 450 to 1000 nm in the spectrum of the untreated p-Si solar cells; this value matches the wavelength range of p-Si light absorption well and also illustrates that the silicon substrate plays a role in the photocarrier generation and solar light absorption of the cell.40 The cell with the single Sb2Ox layer achieved remarkable enhancement in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) compared with p-Si solar cells without a metal oxide layer, and it was even higher than that of p-Si solar cells with the single CdO layer at a wavelength under 600 nm. This is because the Sb2Ox layer can help the p-Si solar cell to absorb high-energy photons. Meanwhile, the EQE spectrum of the p-Si solar cell with CdO/Sb2Ox layers also exhibits larger increase, reaching its maximum of 93.49% at 535 nm and surpassing 80% in the wavelength range between 410 and 850 nm. It is worth noting that due to the outstanding light-trapping ability, the cell with double layers exhibited higher EQE compared with the cell with single CdO nanoparticles beyond 800 nm. To compare with the untreated p-Si solar cell, we improved the EQE by more than 12% in the region below 600 nm, and the total reflectance reduction was around 5–7%, as shown in a previous graph. Consequently, this difference implied that the enhancement in light trapping is not the only reason for the improvement in EQE. Thus, we further estimated the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the p-Si solar cells with the metal oxide layer. The IQE measurement is a more direct measure of the intrinsic quality of the solar cell structure because it excludes loss due to optical reflection and is useful to demonstrate whether the separation/collection of the carriers occurring inside the battery is effective. IQE, namely, the actually absorbed photons in the active layers could be converted by EQE. It is the ratio between the value of Jsc and the number of absorbed AM 1.5G photons per unit time and area.41 Also, IQE can be calculated by the empirical formula42,43 IQE = EQE/(1 − R), where R is the reflectivity of the cell. As shown in Fig. 4d, after introducing the Sb2Ox layer, the increase in IQE, especially below 600 nm, indicates that the Sb2Ox layer contributes to efficiency enhancement of carrier separation/collection.

Fig. 4e shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of p-Si solar cells under air mass (AM) 1.5 conditions. Typical photovoltaic behaviors were observed. The J–V curve of the untreated p-Si solar cell exhibits short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 33.6 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.57 V and fill factor (FF) of 65.9%, resulting in PCE of 12.6%. In contrast, the J–V curve for the p-Si solar cell integrated with metal oxide layers exhibits higher Jsc and Voc. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The absolute increase in Voc and Jsc led to dramatic improvement in the cell efficiency. Compared with the observation for cell without any metal oxide layer, the conversion efficiency of the cell with CdO/Sb2Ox layers was 16.7%, which was about 33% higher than that of the untreated p-Si solar cell, 11% higher than that of the cell with the single Sb2Ox layer and 13% higher than that of the cell with single CdO nanoparticles. FF also increased from 65.9% to 69.8%, indicating decrease in series resistance. The performance of cells with metal oxide layers dramatically improved due to the increase in Jsc and Voc, which further confirmed that the CdO/Sb2Ox layers help the separation/collection of the photogenerated carriers and meanwhile work as the surface passivation layers to suppress carrier recombination. The decrease in electron recombination resulted in lower saturation current density (J0: the pre-exponential constant), which in turn increased the open circuit voltage (VOC) according to the famous equation:14

Here, q is the charge of an electron, Jsc is the short-circuit current density and is generally equal to the photocurrent, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and n is the ideality factor. This is the reason why Voc increases after the deposition of metal oxide layers. Theoretically, a wide-band-gap semiconductor possesses larger built-in electric fields, corresponding to the increase in Voc, and this is supposed to be another reason. As can be seen from the comparison of Fig. 4(a)–(d), after the preparation of the double metal oxide layers on the surface of cell, the absorption amount of photons increased; specifically, the high-energy photons, Jsc and Voc, increased correspondingly, which also confirmed the substantial improvement in the final efficiency.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to elucidate the chemical state of elements in the metal oxide layer. XPS analysis was conducted on the metal oxide layer deposited onto the Si substrate. The binding energies in the XPS spectra are presented in Fig. 5, calibrated by contaminant carbon (C 1s = 284.6 eV). The XPS spectra (Fig. 5a, b, c and d) confirm the high chemical purity of the CdO NP layer and Sb2Ox layer, respectively.44,45 The Sb 3d3/2 line was used to determine Sb concentration,46 and the deconvolution of the Sb 3d5/2 peak revealed two peaks at 530.29 and 530.99 eV, corresponding to antimony(III) and antimony(V) oxides47 in addition to an overlapping broad O 1s signal. The binding energies of Sb 3d5/2 and Sb 3d3/2 were around 530.3 eV and 539.6 eV (Fig. 5c), which were in agreement with other reported values.48,49

To investigate the oxidation effect of the deposition of metal oxide, we focused primarily on the formation of SiOx at binding energies from 101 eV to 105 eV. For the untreated p-Si surface, only Si 2p3 and 2p1 peaks corresponding to crystalline Si were observed. Fig. 5d shows the Sb peak after the deposition of metal oxides. As XPS is only sensitive to elements on the surface, the intensity of peaks from the silicon substrates should decrease dramatically after the deposition of metal oxides. However, after depositing CdO layer, new peaks of SiOx were observed between 101 eV and 105 eV; this indicated that during the deposition of the metal oxide layer, silicon reacted with metal oxides on the surface to form oxidized interfacial layers, which decreased electron/hole recombination. For the purpose of addressing this problem, we utilized the Sb2Ox layer; it can be clearly found from Fig. 5f that the oxidation effect decreases after depositing Sb2Ox layer, which is beneficial for improving cell performance.
For the purpose of giving a reasonable explanation for the superior performance of the p-Si solar cell with metal oxide layers, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was first employed to explore the dynamic information of the devices. The EIS response is characterized by a semicircle in the fourth quadrant (positive, real; negative, imaginary). Specifically, the x-intercept of the semicircle represents the transport resistance (Rt) of the solar cell when the phase angle (ϕ) is equal to 0°. Fig. 6(a) and (b) display Nyquist plots of the p-Si solar cells without and with CdO/Sb2Ox layers, respectively, under different forward bias values in the dark. One can see that the p-Si solar cell with CdO/Sb2Ox layers exhibits much smaller Rt than the cell without treatment at different forward bias voltages, revealing much more efficient electron–hole transport.50Fig. 6(c) exhibits a direct comparison of the p-Si solar cells without and with the metal oxide layer at 0 V in the dark (ϕ = 0°). One can see from the values that the p-Si solar cell with CdO/Sb2Ox layers (237 Ω) has only one third of Rt than the untreated p-Si solar cell (696 Ω) and nearly half Rt than the cell with the single Sb2Ox layer (428 Ω) or with the single CdO layer (506 Ω), yielding much longer effective minority carrier lifetimes (τeff) (Fig. 7). When the p-Si solar cell was integrated with the Sb2Ox layer, the separation/collection velocity of photogenerated electrons and holes accelerated, and τeff increased due to sharp decrease in Rt. Beyond that, surface recombination was effectively reduced after the deposition of the Sb2Ox layer. The increase in τeff also proved that the Sb2Ox layer is an effective passivation layer because it binds to the suspended bonds on the surface of the silicon wafer; thus, the surface recombination centers are greatly reduced.

The p-Si solar cell with metal oxide layers exhibited higher Jsc (38.7 mA cm2) and Voc (0.62 V). The increase in Jsc and Voc was partly contributed by improved τeff, which could be illustrated by the following equations:  
Here, q is the charge on the electron, ND,A is the donor or acceptor concentration of the wafer, kT/q is the thermal voltage, ni is the intrinsic carrier concentration, Δn is the excess carrier concentration, G is the generation rate, and Ln and Lp are diffusion lengths of electrons and holes, respectively. Although the formulas are based on certain theoretical assumptions, one can tell that excess carrier diffusion length and concentration, which are directly proportional to τeff, contribute greatly to Voc and Jsc.51
Conclusions
In conclusion, efficiency from 12.6% to 16.7% was achieved for an Sb2Ox/CdO/Si cell due to reduction of surface reflection and suppression of carrier recombination by using metal oxide layers in p-Si solar cells. The p-Si solar cell with Sb2Ox/CdO layers exhibited Voc of 0.62 V, Jsc of 38.7 mA cm−2 and FF of 69.6%, leading to higher PCE of 16.7%. The light reflectance spectra of p-Si solar cells with metal oxide layers show great reduction in the reflectance, especially after the deposition of the CdO layer. We ascribed these improvements to their graded refractive indices and moderate surface roughness. The EIS analyses suggested that the deposited Sb2Ox layer and CdO NP layer could result in superior charge transport in p-Si solar cells and benefit the charge generation/separation on the front surface, which indicated that Sb2Ox/CdO/Si heterojunctions play an important role in conduction. Besides, the Sb2Ox layer yielded excellent surface passivation on the CdO/Si solar cell, effectively decreasing the oxygen deficiency and the recombination losses. Our fabrication approach involves a spin-coating and dip-coating method instead of any vacuum systems, sputter deposition or lithography processes. Notably, the simplicity and practicability of our method for silicon solar cells are beneficial to both industrial production and advanced solar cell technology.
