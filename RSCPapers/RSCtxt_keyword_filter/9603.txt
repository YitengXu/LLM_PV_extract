    , Accepted 29th May 2021First published on 1st June 2021AbstractPEDOT:PSS is one of the most frequently used hole transporting layer (HTL) for solution-processed optoelectronic devices, but seems unsuccessful in high-performance lead based perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) due to the high open-circuit voltage (VOC) loss as induced by the improper interfacial chemical interactions, i.e. the coordination between sulfonic group and Pb2+. To address this issue, we change this chemical interaction by incorporating potassium citrate (PC) into the PEDOT:PSS film. The PC modification significantly improves the PL intensity by nearly one order of magnitude, verifying the strong passivation effect. Accordingly, the VOC loss of MAPbI3 based inverted PVSCs is dramatically reduced by 0.23 eV, and the device performance is improved from 16.31% to 19.66%, which is among the highest PVSCs with PEDOT:PSS as HTL. Interestingly, we find the energy level alignment plays a negligible role in determining the device performance of PVSCs, while the change of interfacial chemical interaction induced passivation effect contributes to the improved device performance of PVSCs. We further unveil that the passivation effect of PC is attributed to the synergistic effect of K+ and citrate group. Our work stresses the importance of tuning the interfacial interactions, and should have implication for developing high-performance PVSCs.
Introduction
Solar energy is the ideal energy source for social and environmental sustainability. Halide perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) are emerging as a promising photovoltaic technology that can efficiently convert the clean and renewable solar energy into electrical power at low cost.1–6 In recent years, PVSCs have been extensively studied, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been improved to a certified value of 25.5%.7 However, the conventional device structure (n–i–p), on which the high-performance PVSCs are based, involves a high temperature process to sinter the commonly used TiO2, SnO2, etc.8–10 This increases the energy cost for PVSCs production, and moreover, is not compatible with a polymer substrate for flexibility and low-cost roll to roll manufacturing.
In contrast, the inverted structure of PVSCs (p–i–n) with polymer interfacial layers possesses the advantage of low-temperature fabrication, suitable for a roll-to-roll manufacturing process.11–13 In inverted PVSCs, the perovskite layer is sandwiched between a hole transport layer (HTL) and an electron transport layer (ETL) from the bottom to the top, respectively.14–16 Both HTL and ETL need to be adequately conductive and energetically compatible with anode and cathode, respectively, for highly efficient charge extraction. Among all HTLs, poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is the most widely used in optoelectronic devices, such as organic light emitting devices,17–19 organic photovoltaics (OPVs),20–24etc., due to its high transparency, mechanical stability, and low-temperature processing. However, PEDOT:PSS typically induces a relatively low open-circuit voltage (VOC) of less than 1 V and low PCE for lead based PVSCs, which could be attributed to the energy level mismatch or the unfavorable chemical interactions between PEDOT:PSS and the perovskite film.25–27
Numerous efforts have been made to modify PEDOT:PSS to achieve high-performance PVSCs,28 while preserving the aforementioned advantages of PEDOT:PSS. Xue and co-workers used a dopamine (DA) semiquinone radical modified PEDOT:PSS as the HTL.29 It was demonstrated that the amino and hydroxyl groups in DA can interact with the uncoordinated Pb atoms on the perovskite crystal, which reduced charge-recombination rate, increased charge-extraction efficiency, and boosted the PCE from 16.2% to 18.5%. Lee et al. used a perfluorinated ionomer to modulate the work function (WF) of a self-organized PEDOT:PSS, and constructed highly efficient PVSCs.30,31 Imidazole has also been used to tailor the surface texture and electronic properties of PEDOT:PSS, promote the perovskite film morphology, and achieve an enlarged VOC of 1.06 V.25 Additionally, Yan et al. doped PEDOT:PSS with cesium iodide (CsI) to reduce the voltage loss and achieve highly efficient PVSCs.32 The CsI modified the interface between PEDOT:PSS and perovskite by reacting with PbI2 and forming CsPbI3, and improved interfacial contact and charge transport. Hu et al. blended sodium citrate into PEDOT:PSS, and achieved higher work function.20 Interestingly, in a separate work, Syed et al. deposited a thin layer of sodium citrate on top of a PEDOT:PSS surface, and observed decreased work function.33 Nevertheless, both works reported improved device performance, regardless of the different work function variation trend, which suggests the failure of interfacial energy level alignment to predict the device performance.
In this work, we demonstrate high performance PVSCs with PEDOT:PSS as HTL via potassium citrate (PC) modification (abbreviated as PC M-PEDOT). The improvement in device performance is attributed to the change of interfacial chemical interaction induced strong passivation effect, as evidenced by around one order of magnitude of improvement in the PL intensity with PC modification. Interestingly, we observe the WF of PEDOT:PSS decreases with PC modification, indicating improper energy level alignment at the anode interface. By comparing with organic solar cells, it is confirmed that the improved device performance of PVSCs with PC modification is not owing to the interfacial energy level alignment, and the importance of interfacial chemical interaction for PVSCs is stressed. Further, the influence of different citrate and potassium acetate modified PEDOT:PSS on the PVSC device performance is studied, including PC, sodium citrate (SC) lithium citrate (LC), citric acid (CA) and potassium acetate (PA), and the unique passivation effect of PC is identified, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of K+ and citrate. As a result, the PC M-PEDOT significantly improves the VOC of PVSCs from 0.893 to 1.099 V, and boosts the PCE from 16.31% to 19.66%, which is among the highest values for PVSCs with PEDOT:PSS as HTL.
Results and discussion
The PEDOT:PSS based inverted PVSC structure is used in this work to explore the effect of PC modification. The schematic configuration of inverted planar PVSCs applying MAPbI3 as the active layer is displayed in Fig. 1a. Firstly, the PC concentration dependent device performance is studied. The resulting J–V curves are shown in Fig. S1,† and the corresponding device parameters are shown in Fig. 1b and Table S1.† As shown, the PVSC device with PEDOT:PSS as HTL exhibits low VOC of 0.893 V, JSC of 22.06 mA cm−2, and FF of 82.83%, resulting a low PCE of 16.31%. With the incorporation of PC in PEDOT:PSS, the VOC of PVSCs gradually increases. By incorporating 0.035 M PC in PEDOT:PSS, the VOC significantly increases to 1.099 V compared to that (0.893 V) without PC modification. Moreover, the improvement in VOC causes no loss in JSC and FF, and results in a champion PCE of 19.66%. However, further increasing the concentration of PC over 0.035 M ruins the FF and JSC of PVSCs. Therefore, the optimal concentration of 0.035 M was chosen as objective for further study. To confirm the improvement with PC modification, 30 devices are fabricated to derive the average and standard deviation. Fig. 1c shows the efficiency histogram of PVSCs, and the PVSCs with PC modification exhibit the average PCE and standard deviation of 19.17% and 0.25%, respectively. While the PVSCs without PC modification show much lower averaged PCE of 15.97% and standard deviation of 0.24%, confirming the improvement of device performance with PC modification.

Further, the hysteresis behavior of PVSCs without or with PC modification is studied, as shown in Fig. 1d and Table 1. The devices are measured with different scan directions to study the hysteresis effect of our devices, and the hysteresis index (HI) values are calculated from the J–V curves based on eqn (1):34 (1)

The HI is 0.02 for PEDOT:PSS, and 0.01 for PC M-PEDOT. As a result, it is clear that the hysteresis effect was suppressed using PC M-PEDOT as HTL.

Fig. 1e shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra and the corresponding integrated photocurrent (JCAL) curves for the optimized devices. The corresponding JCALs are 20.96, 20.99 mA cm−2 for the devices based on PEDOT:PSS and PC M-PEDOT, respectively, which are close (within 5%) to the JSC values measured under the simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation. The obvious enhancement of the EQE spectra at the long-wavelength part (around 700 nm) with PC modification can be possibly attributed to the change in optical parameters, as shown in Fig. S2 and S3.† By applying a bias voltage near the maximum power output points, we recorded the time dependent photocurrent densities to measure the steady state output of the PVSCs under AM 1.5 G 1 sun intensity. As shown in Fig. 1f, the output curve of PVSCs with pure PEDOT:PSS shows a steady output PCE of ∼16.1% with a bias of 0.81 V, while the PVSC with PC M-PEDOT shows a steady state output power of ∼19.4% with a bias of 0.93 V. The steady state output (∼500 s) measurement proves that both devices have stabilized performance, and confirms the effectiveness of PC modification for high-performance PVSCs. These measurements complete the internal self-check on the efficiency derived from the J–V curves, validate the device results, and confirming the effectiveness of PC modification for improving the device performance of PVSCs.
The stability of PVSCs without or with PC modification is studied. Fig. S4† shows the normalized PCE values as a function of storage time of PVSC devices fabricated without or with PC modification. These devices are stored in a N2 filled glove-box without any encapsulation. The PCEs of all devices can retain 97% of their initial values after 55 days storage, which suggests that the incorporation of PC into PEDOT:PSS has no obvious influence on device stability.
For fair comparison, we summarized the device performances of PVSCs with PEDOT:PSS as HTL, as shown in Fig. S5 and Table S2.† These include the VOC and PCE for inverted MAPbI3 PVSCs based on doped, bilayer HTL and special treatment of PEDOT:PSS HTLs. As shown, it is clear that our result ranks among the highest of MAPbI3 PVSCs with PEDOT:PSS as HTL. The most prominent effect of PC modification is the improvement of VOC, which is tightly correlated with the interface energy level alignment or the non-radiative charge recombination. In the following sections, the mechanism of device performance improvement with PC incorporation is studied.
As is known, the work function (WF) of interfacial layers is an important factor influencing the interfacial energy level alignment and the subsequent charge collection. Thereafter, the WF of PEDOT:PSS and PC M-PEDOT is measured and compared by using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) with He I (21.22 eV). The UPS spectra of PEDOT:PSS with or without PC modification are shown in Fig. 2a. The WF of PEDOT:PSS is measured to be 4.89 eV, consistent with literature reports.35,36 However, the WF of PEDOT:PSS drops to 4.55 eV after PC modification. The corresponding schematic energy level diagram is shown in Fig. 2b. From the energy level alignment theory, the lower WF of PEDOT:PSS with PC modification is not favorable for hole extraction at the anode interface, and tends to induce excessive surface charge recombination to reduce the VOC. Thereafter, the interfacial energy alignment can not be responsible for the significantly improved device performance with PC modification. To verify this point, we applied the PC M-PEDOT to organic solar cells (OSCs), where the PM6:BO-4Cl (the molecular structures are shown in Fig. S6†) is adopted as active layer. In the organic solar cell, van der Waals interaction governs the interfaces, which can exclude the influence of chemical interaction to independently study the effect of energy level alignment on device performance. The schematic device structure and the J–V characteristic curves of OSCs without or with PC modification are shown in Fig. 2c, and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 1. As shown, after PC modification, the VOC of OSC is significantly reduced, which is consistent with the WF variation and energy alignment as shown in Fig. 2d. In sharp contrast, the failure of interfacial energy level alignment theory for predicting the variation of device performance of PVSCs suggests that the interfacial chemical interaction induced charge recombination suppression accounts for the improved VOC or device performance instead of the interfacial energy level alignment. Similar variation was also found in Cs0.05MA0.09FA0.81Pb1I2.86Br0.09 PVSC and PCE10:IEICO-4F OSC (Table S3, Fig. S7 and S8†). Notably, our observation is not a special case, and the “paradox” between the device performance and interfacial energy level mis-alignment is generally observed in several other examples with modified PEDOT:PSS etc.33,37–39 The failure of energy level alignment theory in PVSCs might originate from the ionic nature of perovskite, which forms an undetectable dipole moment to modify the band bending.

As mentioned previously, the morphology of perovskite films can be affected by the substrate surface.21,29,40–42 To understand how the PC modification affects the device performance, we studied the morphology of the MAPbI3 perovskite films on the surface of PEDOT:PSS without or with PC modification. As shown in Fig. 3a, the perovskite film with PEDOT:PSS is constructed of compactly packed random crystalline grains and large numbers of GBs. With PC modification, the perovskite film exhibits larger grain size, which can even exceed one micrometer (Fig. 3b). Similar effect has been observed in the cross-sectional SEM images of perovskite film without or with PC modification, as shown in Fig. S9a and b.† The larger grain size can be attributed to the surface chemical environment directed the perovskite crystallization, for we observe almost no change in the surface roughness and surface wettability as shown in Fig. S10 and S11.†Fig. 3c presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite films fabricated with different substrates. The diffraction peaks at around 14.1° and 28.5° can be respectively ascribed to the (110) and (220) lattice planes of the MAPbI3 crystal free of PbI2. However, the FWHM of perovskite films on PEDOT:PSS and PC M-PEDOT is almost the same (Fig. 3d), corresponding to a crystal size of 63 nm according to the Scherrer eqn (2): τ = Kλ/βcosθ(2)where τ is the main size of the crystalline domains, K (=0.89) is a dimensionless shape factor, λ (=0.154178 nm) is the X-ray wavelength, β is the line broadening at half the maximum intensity (FWHM) after subtracting the instrumental line broadening in radians, and θ is the Bragg angle. This indicates that incorporating PC has no influence on the crystal size, which is the basic building block composing the perovskite domains.

Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is used to investigate the carrier dynamics within perovskite films. Fig. 3e shows the PL spectra, and the PL intensity of perovskite films on PC M-PEDOT is dramatically enhanced by a factor of 2 compared to that without PC, while the PL peak positions of perovskite films are unchanged. At the anode interface, the charge transfer and surface charge recombination occur simultaneously, and it is hard to tell in which channel the PL is quenched. To exclude the influence of interfacial charge transfer and isolate the effect of interfacial chemical interaction on carrier decay, we fabricate perovskite films on single PSS insulating layer instead of the PEDOT:PSS. The removal of electrical active PEDOT in the PEDOT:PSS suppresses the electronic coupling between the perovskite film and the interfacial charge transfer. As shown in Fig. 3f, the PL intensity of perovskite on PC modified PSS film increases by a factor of 7 compared to that on pristine PSS, which indicates reduced non-radiative decay and strong passivation effect with PC modification. These results confirm the passivation role of PC for perovskite films. The less improved PL intensity of perovskite films on PEDOT:PSS after PC modification suggests that the PC boosts the electron transfer between perovskite and PEDOT:PSS.
Fig. S12† shows the results of the dark current measurement for devices with or without PC modification. The device fabricated with PC M-PEDOT shows higher rectification and less leakage current at the negative bias, consistent with the reduced non-radiative surface charge recombination. Further, the trap state density of the devices with PEDOT:PSS or PC M-PEDOT was determined by a space charge limited current (SCLC) method by measuring the J–V curves of the hole-only device with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (or PC M-PEDOT)/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. The results are shown in Fig. S13a and b.† The green line with a slope of 1 corresponds to the ohmic region, followed by a trap-filled region and trap-free SCLC region with a slope of 2 (magenta line). The substantial rise in the current density from the ohmic region correlates with a trap-filled limit region, where all defects are filled by charges.43,44 The trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) for the device with PEDOT:PSS is 0.37 V, and the value of VTFL was reduced to 0.28 V for device fabricated with PC M-PEDOT. The defect density could be calculated by eqn (3): Ndefects = 2εε0VTFL/eL2(3)where ε (= 32) and ε0 (=8.85 × 10−12 F m−1) are the dielectric constants of MAPbI3 and the vacuum permittivity, respectively, L is the thickness of perovskite film, and the thicknesses of perovskite films on PEDOT:PSS and PC M-PEDOT are both around 550 nm measured by DEKTAK TX from Bruker, and e (=1.6 × 10−19 C) is the elementary charge.45 Therefore, we estimated the defect densities to be 4.3 × 1015 cm−3 and 3.3 × 1015 cm−3 for perovskite films on PEDOT:PSS and PC M-PEDOT, respectively. These results illustrate reduced traps and suppressed charge recombination due to the passivation effect of PC.
As mentioned above, the interfacial chemical interactions play a major role for improving the device performance, especially the VOC. In the PC molecule, there are two parts that can form possible passivation with the perovskite film, i.e. the K+ ion and the citrate group. To probe the passivation effect of the two parts individually, we modified the PEDOT:PSS with the citrate acid (CA) and potassium acetate (KAc). For fair comparison, the concentration of CA is fixed at 0.035, as similar to that of PC, and concentration of KAc is fixed at 0.105 to maintain a similar amount of K+ compared to the PC. Fig. 4a and b shows the J–V characteristic curves and the variation of VOC and PCE of PVSCs with CA and KAc modified PEDOT:PSS, and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table S4.† It is observed that the device prepared with CA or KAc modified PEDOT:PSS can only increase the VOC slightly, i.e. from 0.893 V to 0.919 V and 0.906 V, respectively, and the subsequent device performance improvement is very limited, i.e. from 16.31% to 16.48% and 16.50%, respectively. It verifies that potassium or citrate individually are not as effective as the PC, and implies the synergistic passivation effect of citrate and K+ of PC.
 Fig. 4  (a) J–V curves and (b) variation of VOC and PCE of PVSCs with different substrates. 
Further, the passivation effect of citrate with different metals, i.e. Na+ (sodium citrate, SC) and Li+ (lithium citrate, LC), was also investigated, as shown in Fig. 4a, b and Table S4.† Compared with the PVSC device with pristine PEDOT:PSS as interfacial layer, the performance of all alkaline citrate modified PEDOT:PSS PVSCs has been greatly improved. Still, the PC shows the best enhancement effect, followed by SC and LC. Among the various parameters, VOC increases dramatically. It has been demonstrated that the VOC loss is directly related to non-radiative charge recombination or the passivation effect. The difference in VOC loss indicates that the passivation ability of Li+, Na+ and K+ is different.
The passivation effect of K+ has been well studied in previous literature reports.46,47 Here, we focused on investigating the molecular origin of citrate induced chemical interaction and the passivation effect. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurement was conducted. The PbI2, PC powder and PbI2/PC blend films are prepared and compared. As shown in Fig. 5a, the peak at 1589 cm−1 of neat PC film is attributed to the COO− asymmetric stretching vibration. The peak shifts to 1572 cm−1 when blending PC with PbI2, indicating strong interaction between the carboxyl group and PbI2. In the meantime, the COO− symmetrical stretching vibration at 1340 cm−1 in neat PC shifts to 1387 cm−1 when blending with PbI2.48 Moreover, the distinct neat PC related peaks at 1327 and 1114 cm−1, which correspond to O–H in-plane bending and C–O stretching vibrations in the saturated tertiary alcohol, respectively, disappear in the PbI2/PC blend. These results indicate strong interaction between Pb2+ and PC carboxyl anions and hydroxyl groups, which can potentially build the basis for molecular passivation of perovskite films. Considering the passivation effect of K+ relies on interacting with the excess I− at the interface or grain boundary,47 the possible mechanism of synergistic passivation effect can be interpreted as follows. At the grain boundary, the chemical bonds lose their balance and tend to escape from the lattice driven by entropy. I−, which coordinates with Pb2+ in the perovskite lattice, tends to be relaxed at the perovskite/PEDOT:PSS interface. The free I− is captured by K+, while the remaining Pb2+ can be coordinated with the citrate group for passivation (Fig. 5b).

(b) Potential passivation effect: the I−, which coordinates with the Pb2+ in the perovskite lattice, tends to be relaxed at the perovskite/PEDOT:PSS interface. The free I− is captured by K+, while the remaining Pb2+ can be coordinated with the citrate group for passivation. 
Further, the surface composition of the PC M-PEDOT and pristine PEDOT:PSS films were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, in order to confirm the possibility of the above mentioned passivation mechanism. As shown in Fig. 6a and d, the distinct peak from the K 2p orbital appears in the PC M-PEDOT, and is not observed in pristine PEDOT:PSS. This indicates the PC exists on the surface of the modified PEDOT:PSS. The corresponding deconvolution S 2p XPS spectra obtained by the Gaussian fitting are shown in Fig. 6b and e. The S 2p XPS peaks in the binding energy ranging from 162 eV to 166 eV are attributed to the S atom in the PEDOT chains, and the S 2p XPS peaks in the binding energy ranging from 166 eV to 172 eV are assigned to the S atom in the PSS chains.33 From S 2p XPS analysis, we found that the ratio of PEDOT to PSS measured for the PC M-PEDOT is 0.174, which is very close to that measured for the pristine PEDOT:PSS (0.167). This suggests that the addition of PC has little effect on the phase segregation of PEDOT:PSS. In addition, the O 1s spectrum (Fig. 6c and f) shows a peak at 533 eV, which represents the PEDOT part, and the peak near 531 eV is related to the PSS and PC.49 For pristine PEDOT:PSS, the ratio of PSS to PEDOT is 1.77, while, the ratio of PSS and PC to PEDOT increases to 4.03 with PC modification. Combined with the analysis of S 2p, it indicates the surface of PC M-PEDOT contains a large number of citric acid derived from PC, which can coordinate with PbI2 to trigger effective surface passivation and improve the perovskite film morphology for suppressing the VOC loss and improving the device performance of PVSCs.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrate high-performance PVSCs with PEDOT:PSS as HTL, via PC modification. The PC enables significant increase in VOC and PCE of PVSC. We found the improved VOC was not related with energy level matching, but with the strong passivation effect. SEM and XRD shows that the use of the PC M-PEDOT is beneficial to enlarge the grain size, reduce the GBs and improve crystallinity, which promote charge transport together with suppressed carrier recombination. Moreover, the FTIR spectra show that there is a strong interaction between Pb2+ and PC carboxyl anions and hydroxyl groups, which change the interfacial chemical interactions and reduce the non-radiative charge recombination. Further, we find the citrate and K+ of PC passivate the perovskite film in a synergistic way. As a result, the best PVSC exhibits a PCE of 19.66%, which represents one of the highest values among inverted MAPbI3 PVSCs with PEDOT:PSS as HTL.
