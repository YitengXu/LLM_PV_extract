    , Accepted 9th March 2021First published on 26th March 2021AbstractIn the last few years, imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine nuclei and derivatives have attracted growing attention due to their unique chemical structure and versatility, optical behaviours, and biological properties. This class of aromatic heterocycles has great potential in several research areas, from materials science to the pharmaceutical field, and in recent years many promising innovations have been reported in different technological applications, such as optoelectronic devices, sensors, anti-cancer drugs, and emitters for confocal microscopy and imaging.
1. Introduction
Imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine (impy) is a very special molecule. It is easily functionalized by the introduction of substituents in different positions. It can act as a versatile ligand by binding several different metal ions. Most of its derivatives are water-soluble and biocompatible, because of their facile uptake by living cells. Impy optoelectronic features are remarkable, since impy-based molecules display unique photophysical properties with quantum yields up to 50%, very large Stokes shift (up to 100–150 nm) and good stability under the tested conditions. For all of these reasons, impy is attracting growing attention among researchers all over the world and engaged in very different research fields (see Fig. 1). The purpose of the present focus article is to present the reported applications of a large variety of molecular products comprising the imidazo[1,5-a]pyridine (impy) nucleus.

Rather than concentrating on a particular class of application, the aim here is to provide an overall view on these promising heterocyclic emitters, suitable for different biological and technological applications. The intended audience is, on one side, researchers already active in the area and, on the other, those who might be newcomers to it.
Since 19851 more than 1500 citations and sixty papers concerning this subject have been published. As far as we know, no review has been yet published concerning the reported applications of impy derivatives; the main goal of this work is to provide a complete list of the reported achievements of these promising heterocyclic emitters.
2. Application of impy derivatives
2.1 General applications in medicine
The impy nucleus has been recently investigated and tested as a drug for different medical applications. In particular, impy derivatives have been tested (not long ago) for cancer treatment,2 as potent ligands of diverse molecular targets localized in the central nervous system3,4 or for their effect on human castration-resistant prostate cancer cells.5 Moreover, due to their biological properties,6impy derivative molecules have been employed for pharmaceutical studies and applications,7,8 such as HIV-protease inhibitors,9 cardiotonic agents,10 aromatase inhibitors in oestrogen dependent diseases11 and thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitors.1 Furthermore, the impy nucleus is present in several drug relevant molecules and biologically active agents, such as RORc inverse agonists in inflammatory diseases,12 5-HT4 receptor partial agonists in Alzheimer's disease13 and antitumor agents.14
In the design of new templates, many authors have chosen the impy ring as a core structure, because it has common structural features to those of indazole rings, as follows: (1) imidazopyridine consists of a bicyclic 5–6 fused ring system; (2) two nitrogen atoms are in the five-membered ring; (3) two substituents can be easily introduced at positions 1 and 3 of the core structure (see Fig. 2). Moreover, impy derivatives generally seem to be favourable concerning absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion parameters (ADME parameters) such as water-solubility, high metabolic stability, and bioavailability.

2.2 Sensors for cysteine
R. Mayilmurugana et al. have reported an interesting study concerning the application of impy derivatives as sensors for cysteine.2 The overexpression of cysteine cathepsin proteases is well known in a wide variety of cancers, which enhances the concentration of L-cysteine. In their study, the authors have designed and synthesized new Cu(II) complexes with impy derivatives as optical probes for imaging, via a ‘turn-on’ luminescent mechanism, of L-cysteine. The tested impy probe exhibited a selective and intense “turn-on” emission after the interaction with L-cysteine, and images in cancer cells were collected through copper reduction (copper(II) to copper(I)) without impy ligand displacement.
2.3 Sensors for hydrogen polysulfides
Another interesting application of impy drugs concerns the detection of hydrogen polysulfides for biomedical applications. The hydrogen polysulfides (H2Sn) influence a variety of important biological functions and activities associated with hydrogen sulfide. The development of probes for fast, selective and sensitive detection of Hydrogen Polysulfides still remains a great challenge. A new lysosome-targetable probe, based on the scaffold of imidazo[1,5-]pyridine, with a large Stokes shift, low detection limit, fast response time (6 min) and low cytotoxicity was designed, synthesized and applied by S. Wang et al.18 Furthermore, this new lysosome-targetable probe was successfully applied for detection of endogenous lysosome-targetable H2Sn in cell imaging.
2.4 Modulators in central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction
More in general, a literature survey shows that impy ligands and derivatives can be powerful modulators of several diseases associated with CNS dysfunction, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and sleeping disorders or depression. Imidazopyridine derivatives usefully interact with different biological targets in the CNS, thus proving to be a versatile structural template in the design of novel CNS modulators. In the field of CNS modulators, the imidazopyridine era began in the late 1980s19 and escalated in 1992, by the successful development and drug approval of an imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine compound named “zolpidem”. In the following decades, a vast number of potent imidazopyridine drugs were introduced to the market. In particular, a series of impy products was recently described to act as potent agonists for cannabinoid receptors (CB2/CB1) with significant analgesic effects in rats, highly tunable selectivity and physical properties that allow CNS penetration.20
2.5 Chemical sensors
Small fluorescent molecules have recently received more attention due to their operational simplicity, high sensitivity, selectivity, and direct visualization. In particular, water-soluble molecules are conjugated to fluorescent probes for imaging in living cells or real-time monitoring by detection of metal ions. Recently, impy products have received considerable attention due to their photophysical properties and potential applications as highly emissive, water-soluble, and pH-sensitive fluorescent nuclei. Generally, impy derivatives show large Stokes shifts (up to 100–150 nm), high photo-stability with generally an intense green-emission, relatively high fluorescence quantum yield and convenient one-step preparation under mild conditions. The general impy properties make this class of compounds suitable for investigations, studies and possible applications as sensors. Many studies have been previously reported concerning the application of different impy products as sensors, for example for the quantification of hydrogen sulfide21 and hydrogen polysulfides,18 sulfur dioxide,22 hypochlorous acid,23–25 and metal ions such as Cu2+,26 Cd2+ and Zn2+,27 and Hg2+.28Impy products can be successfully employed as ratiometric pH-sensors based on a dual emission pathway.29,30
Moreover, hydrogen ions play an important role in the entire cell life (enzymatic and metabolic activity proliferation, and tumour growth). Many detection strategies have been tested and employed to evaluate the exact pH value, such as acid–base indicator and potentiometric titrations. In comparison to those, emitting impy probes have many advantages such as good selectivity and sensitivity, convenient operation and sometimes real-time monitoring. Impy probes have been previously reported as fluorescent pH probes in living cells.31,32
Besides the internal charge transfer (ICT) process using a single emitter to get ratiometric changes, Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is one of the most widely studied and applied sensing mechanisms for ratiometric luminescent probes. FRET is a non-radiative mechanism in which an excited dye donor transfers energy to a chromophore acceptor in the ground state. Emitters such as rhodamine, fluorescein, quinine, BODIPY, xanthene and coumarin have been employed to design and prepare FRET systems. In general, the donor emission dye must have a strong overlap with the acceptor absorption, which essentially restricts the development of FRET-based couple systems. To this end, different groups have recently designed and synthesized new impy probes, demonstrating their value for FRET-based practical applications in biological systems.22,23,28,33
2.6 Optoelectronic devices
For real applications in optoelectronic devices or for down-shifting technologies, the most important characteristics for a luminescent molecule candidate are a large Stokes shift (to avoid re-absorption) and a high quantum yield. In general, absorbed photons must be re-emitted and not dissipated as heat. For this purpose, a large Stokes shift leads to a low re-absorption, and similarly, high quantum yield ensures that almost every absorbed photon is then re-emitted.
Large Stokes shift emissive small molecules are acquiring great interest, due to their potential application as eco-friendly and low-cost products in down-shifting emissive layers, both in lighting and photovoltaic (PV) fields. Because of their features, impy derivatives are particularly well suited for employment in these fields.15,16,34,35
These compounds have been studied for a large variety of optical applications, including down-shifting15 and non-linear optical (NLO) studies,36 and optoelectronic devices.37–39 Moreover, impy luminescent derivatives could be tested for solar concentrators (LSC) based on thin-film organic molecules, which represent a convenient technology to improve the power conversion efficiency of PV systems (see Fig. 3).

The electroluminescence of impy has been recently investigated for the first time by G. Albrecht et al., employing layered OLEDs, which are based on this fluorogenic nucleus as an emitting system.40,41 Considering the use of coordination compounds containing impy derivatives, up to now only copper complexes bearing impy ligands have been successfully employed in light-emitting electrochemical cells.37,38,42
However, different silver, iridium and zinc complexes based on impy ligands have been reported for possible light-emitting electrochemical cell applications, showing good optical behaviour, such as a high quantum yield and blue emission.44–50 The electrochemical characterization of free impy ligands and corresponding complexes have been reported for the first time by Salassa et al.,48,49 showing that the impy nucleus typically presents reversible oxidation at low potentials, as successively confirmed by G. Albrecht et al.51
2.7 Confocal microscopy
In recent years, a lot of new luminescent probes have been studied in fluorescent microscopy and confocal microscopy. The aims of these studies are different: useful diffusion in different cell compartments, visualization of an area with different pH values using pH sensitive fluorescent molecules, evaluation of tissue added with a different fluorophore which shows complementary optical and chemical behaviours. Part of the effort in this field is focused on obtaining efficient luminescent molecules, such as the well-known BODIPY and rhodamine.52 On the other hand, due to the essential structural flexibility and notable optical properties, impy derivatives represent excellent candidates to be widely studied for these applications.53,54 The distinctive emission of the impy moiety typically lies in the 450–530 nm range, with large Stokes shift (up to 150 nm).

Impy derivatives could represent an interesting alternative to obtain intense emission with fluorescent-based microscopy. Impy products show good solubility, intense emission and good quantum yield, strong pH dependence29,30 and good biocompatibility. In recent years, impy emitters have been successfully tested to obtain cell imaging using confocal microscopy.31,32,55–57
Moreover, impy fluorophores have been tested for multi-coloured bioimaging.58 In general, to obtain multi-coloured bioimaging, the cells or tissues were stained with multiple dyes; as a result of this, it is required to merge different fluorescent images, which were collected under each excitation wavelength suitable for every single fluorophore.
On the other hand, impy derivatives have shown suitable multi-coloured bioimaging using a single excitation wavelength; this technique enables the visualization and detection of the kinetics of biomolecule reaction and interaction due to simultaneous observation. The general results highlight that impy compounds displayed suitable permeability to the plasma membrane and plant cell wall, they were highly adsorbed and distributed in the internal plant tissues, and, more importantly, they retained a strong fluorescence in aqueous media: a critical feature in fluorophores to be used as in vivo probes (see Fig. 4).

Moreover, impy compounds were effective in distinctly labelling the cytoplasm of mouse fibroblast cells in vitro and therefore can be suitable as a counterstain to provide contrast in multi-colour fluorescence microscopy.59
2.8 Application of impy as a ligand
The impy transition metal complexes have a rich literature. As a ligand, the impy skeleton can coordinate a large variety of transition metal ions, producing a great number of metal complexes in a large variety of different coordination motifs. The metal–ligand chemistry including impy ligands has been widely reported, comprising bidentate or tridentate impy structures in the formation of metal complexes for different applications.54,60,61 These multiple impy, connected by different linkers, have been successfully introduced in every possible position on a central aromatic ring; this is a particularly important structural aspect, to ensure a geometry equivalent to the most investigated multi-pyridine ligands largely employed in coordination chemistry, such as poly-pyridines or multi-bipyridines.62–73 Multi-impy have already been employed as a ditopical ligand in dinuclear complexes.60,61,74
The discussion here is to be restricted to the domain of impy as a ligand or luminescent nucleus in the corresponding transition metal complexes.
As ligands, the impy skeleton represents a new polyazine scaffold, which shows different and tuneable coordination motifs suitable for mono-, di-, and tritopic coordination sites (see Fig. 5). These molecules could be considered as potential multidentate ligands or precursors for supramolecular design.75,76
 Fig. 5

In general, the phenylimidazole unit has been reported to act as a cyclometalating ligand, like the more conventional 2-phenylpyridine. In this case, a pendant phenyl group is added in position 1 on the indazole nucleus, thus resulting in a suitable C–N ligand, as successfully reported for different metals.77–81 As far as we know, no example of an impy skeleton has been reported as a C–N ligand, despite its similarity to the phenylimidazole or the more conventional 2-phenylpyridine.
Similarly, the impy core substituted in 1 with a pendant pyridine has been used for coordinating transition metal ions as N–N ligand.53,54,60 In particular, the pendant pyridine group in position 1 on the impy nucleus (compared to the introduction of e.g. a phenyl pendant group) increases the final quantum yield values. Nevertheless, the important presence of the pendant pyridine guarantees the typical N–N bidentate ligand motif (see Fig. 5), which is well-known for allowing suitable complexation reactions with different metals.
In a different case, the impy nucleus can be used as an N–O ligand if an appropriate substituent is previously introduced in position 1 on the impy core (see Fig. 5); this kind of ligand has been coordinated to Ni, Co, Pd and Co, in order to prepare emissive products for optoelectronic devices.45,82–84
Zinc-impy complexes have been successfully synthesized to obtain fluorescent materials for optoelectronic devices.44,46,47,85 In all cases, the comparison between the optical properties of the free impy ligands and the corresponding Zn(II) complex products shows a significant increase of the quantum yield and an interesting hypsochromic shift, caused by the structural modification of the impy ligands conformation upon zinc coordination, and after the complexation reaction.
Copper-impy complexes have been widely studied in OLED and LEC devices, showing a counterintuitive electrochemical yellow emission from cells based on blue-emitting heteroleptic Cu(I) complexes.37,38,42 Overall, the preparation of new Cu(I) complexes towards the design of blue LECs is still largely unexplored and impy derivatives seem to be a good alternative to the widely reported bipyridine and phenanthroline corresponding complexes. Copper and iron complexes have been obtained and structurally characterized, the preliminary results indicate that spontaneous resolution of enantiomers occurs during the crystallization and is consistent with a rare π–donor/π–acceptor chiral recognition mechanism.83
Nickel-impy derivatives have been obtained in a previously reported work concerning the catalytic dimerization of ethylene.86 In this article impy chelate nickel complexes exhibit high activities in dimerizing propylene; conversely, two imidazo-[1,5-a]pyridines were inactive for catalytic oligomerizations with ethylene.
Iridium and rhenium have been successfully complexed with N–N impy ligands, obtaining emissive products; in these cases, computational calculations show a ligand-centred 1π–π* emission, with limited charge-transfer character, or dual emission ligand-centred 1π–π*/3π–π* dual emission.48–50,87,88 The use of DFT and TDDFT calculations was fundamental in elucidating differences among these N–N impy complexes and in their electronic structures and excited states. These works show that Re, Ir N–N impy complexes have good potential for optical application since excited states of their metal complexes can be easily tuned by varying the substituents on the impy nucleus.
Finally, osmium, cadmium and ruthenium have been complexed with impy ligands obtaining interesting adducts suitable for supramolecular chemistry.44,60,61
3. Summary and outlook
It has been about 80 years since the discovery of heterocyclic impy molecules. Throughout this time, numerous derivatives have been synthesized, characterized and successfully applied in different technological fields.
The literature offers many possibilities to tune the optical and electrochemical behaviours of impy products and corresponding impy based complexes, ranging from structural modification of the donor and acceptor ligands to the exchange (type and charge) of the central cations with other metal centres.
Positions 1 and 3 on the impy skeleton were often substituted by different substituent groups or ancillary ligands to increase the synthetic yield or long-term stability, to tune the optical and electrochemical behaviours, as well as the solubility and biocompatibility.
Bidentate and tridentate ligands which exploit coordination through N, O or C atoms have been tested to achieve the corresponding complexes already applied with success in optoelectronic devices such as OLED and LEC.
Recently developed novel synthetic approaches55,89–104 should complement the conventional cyclization methodology for preparing probes based on impy fluorophores.16,34,105–114 In conclusion, these and other innovations are expected to spur the design, development and application of this promising class of compounds in biological sciences and medicine as well as optoelectronics, catalysis and sensor technologies.
