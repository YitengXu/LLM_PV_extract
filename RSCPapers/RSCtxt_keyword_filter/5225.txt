    , Accepted 8th March 2016First published on 9th March 2016AbstractIn bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics, particularly those using small molecules, electron donor and/or electron acceptor materials form a distributed network in the photoactive layer where critical photo-physical processes occur. Extensive research has recently focused on the importance of sulfur atoms in the small molecules. Little is known about the three-dimensional orientation of these sulfur atom-containing molecules. Herein, we report on our research concerning the heterojunction textures of the crystalline molecular orientation of small compounds having sulfur-containing units in the side chains, specifically, compounds known as DR3TSBDT that contain the alkylthio group and DR3TBDTT that does not. The improved performance of the DR3TBDTT-based devices, particularly in the photocurrent and the fill factor, was attributed to the large population of donor compound crystallites with a favorable face-on orientation along the perpendicular direction. This orientation resulted in efficient charge transport and a reduction in charge recombination. These findings underscore the great potential of small-molecule solar cells and suggest that even higher efficiencies can be achieved through materials development and molecular orientation control.
Introduction
Solution-processed small molecules used as donor materials in organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted considerable interest in recent years due to their well-defined structures, low batch-to-batch variation, and easier purification/synthesis compared with polymeric donor materials.1–5 To date, state-of-the-art solution-processed small-molecule-based OPVs have demonstrated power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of >9%; however, their overall performance still significantly lags behind that of their polymeric counterparts.6–9 Improving the PCE of small-molecule OPVs remains a formidable challenge.
The highest reported PCE for these single junction solar cells is currently 9.95%;10 in this work, an oxygen atom was replaced with a sulfur atom in the side group of the small molecules and, thereby, maximized the effect of the sulfur atom in photovoltaic cells. The effect of swapping a furan moiety with a thiophene unit as conjugated linkers in organic dyes has also been compared; a high efficiency of 4.52% was achieved by blending a thiophene unit-bearing compound with fullerene.11 In polymeric systems, attaching the alkylthio substituent on the conjugated thiophene side chains of the two-dimensionally conjugated copolymer provided a remarkable PCE, exceeding 8.4%.12
Many research groups have focused on the introduction of a sulfur atom into donor compounds but only examined their photovoltaic effects. However, the role of the molecule's sulfur unit in the intimate mixing between donors and PCBM acceptors and on the development of the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology is less understood. The molecular orientation of the three-dimensional (3D) arrangement of sulfur group-containing compounds in heterojunction-active textures has not been investigated in depth. Consequently, the detailed structural mechanisms and their effects on charge generation and transport remain elusive.
This contribution focuses on identifying the key parameter(s) affecting molecular orientation from individual structure–performance relationships. To clearly understand and compare the nanostructural crystallinity of compounds with and without sulfur atoms, we chose two small molecules:10,13DR3TBDTT that contains thiophene units and DR3TSBDT that has sulfur atoms in the side groups of the molecules. This work represents a significant advance in understanding the relationships between the molecular structure and morphological characteristics of small-molecule solar cells. Notably, the face-on orientation was more abundant and favorable in the DR3TBDTT photovoltaic cell. This result is crucial for understanding the origin of the high performance of small-molecule-based cells containing sulfur atoms.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the structure of the two novel small molecules, DR3TBDTT and DR3TSBDT, chosen to systematically probe the influence of the chemical structure on the nanostructured morphological orientation of fullerene–acceptor heterojunction films. The two compounds have a benzodithiophene central building block and rhodanine terminal units and differ only in the side chains of the core units: an alkylthienyl group for DR3TBDTT and an alkylthio group for DR3TSBDT.

Photovoltaic performance
The device structure of the small-molecule solar cells used to characterize the photovoltaic properties of DR3TBDTT and DR3TSBDT was indium tin oxide/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate)/small molecule:[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester/aluminum (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/small molecule:PC71BM/Al) (the energy level of these components is shown in the inset of Fig. 2a). The same fabrication conditions were used for all devices, including the blend composition of the active layers and the solution concentration, to isolate the impact of the molecular structure on photovoltaic cell performance. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured under AM 1.5G solar illumination at 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) intensity in ambient air (Fig. 2a); the photovoltaic parameters are reported in Table 1. The optimal performance of the DR3TBDTT:PC71BM devices was achieved with a PCE of 7.27%, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.91 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 13.04 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 61.3%. The DR3TSBDT:PC71BM solar cells had a lower PCE of 5.82%, a Voc of 0.94 V, a JSC of 11.27 mA cm−2, and a FF of 55.0%.

Many reports have described the use of donor materials containing sulfur atoms in photovoltaic cells to provide more ordered molecular packing and thereby higher device performances than cells containing other sulfur-atom-free small molecules.10,14–16 However, the as-cast devices reported here behaved differently. In particular, the significantly different PCE values, an indicator of relative device performances, of these two systems mainly originated from dramatically different photocurrents and fill factor factors, which are strongly associated with nanostructural morphological characteristics in blend films. The in-depth nanoscale morphological textures of the active films are discussed below.
Solid state film morphology of the BHJ active layer
The only difference between these two systems was the small side unit. Thus, the most likely cause of the improved photovoltaic performance of the DR3TBDTT:PC71BM system was an improved nanoscale morphology. To verify this hypothesis, the active films were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 3 shows AFM topographic (height and phase) images of the pure molecule films and the small molecule:PC71BM blend films.
 Fig. 3  Two-dimensional (2D) height (upper panel) and three-dimensional (3D) (lower panel) phase atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the semiconductor films: (a) pure DR3TBDTT, (b) pure DR3TSBDT, (c) DR3TBDTT:PC71BM, and (d) DR3TSBDT:PC71BM. 
The pure active DR3TBDTT film showed a uniform nanoscale morphology, with a smooth surface having a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 0.48 nm. In comparison, the pristine DR3TSBDT surface showed distinctly phase-separated structural features with clearly formed circular domains and had a significantly greater RMS roughness of 4.61 nm (Fig. 3a and b). These aspects were best revealed in 3D phase images. This information suggested stronger intermolecular interactions between the DR3TSBDT molecules, which led to more aggregated crystalline domains and, in turn, was expected to provide better charge transport characteristics.17,18
Interestingly, however, quite similar surface morphologies with RMS roughnesses of <1 nm were observed for both of the DR3TBDTT:PC71BM and DR3TSBDT:PC71BM blends; the blend films did not exhibit clear structural features. In other words, both of the donor compounds blended well with the PCBM molecules in the BHJ films. The surface morphologies revealed by AFM blend imaging did not explain the vastly superior photovoltaic properties of DR3TBDTT:PC71BM devices compared with the corresponding DR3TSBDT devices.
Orientation of small molecule compounds by 2D-GIWAXS analysis
There is a weak relationship between the side group and the blend morphology. AFM only provides insight into the top surface morphology, which is not necessarily representative of the bulk morphology. Therefore, the active layers were studied by two-dimensional grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) to gain insight into their internal structure and morphological characteristics. The origin of the morphology of sulfur- and thiophene-containing small molecules is poorly understood. This work serves as a guide to the structural molecular orientation of these small molecules.

Fig. 4 displays the 2D-GIWAXS patterns of the pure and blend active films that were spin-coated onto Si/PEDOT:PSS substrates (a–d) and their corresponding horizontal and vertical line-cuts (e–h).
 Fig. 4  Two-dimensional grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS) patterns of (a) pristine DR3TBDTT, (b) DR3TBDTT:PC71BM blends, (c) DR3TSBDT, and (d) DR3TSBDT:PC71BM blends. The line-cut intensities are shown for the out-of-plane direction (e: pure small molecules and g: small molecule:PC71BM) and the in-plane direction (f: pure small molecules and h: small molecule:PC71BM). Two fitted curves for the (200) peak position using the Gaussian-fit model are shown in the inset. 
Reflection peaks corresponding to a lamellar structure and π–π stacking were observed along both the out-of-plane (qz) and the in-plane (qxy) axes for all of the pristine small molecule films; this indicated that edge-on and face-on crystallites co-existed in the film.19 However, the scattering intensity of the lamellar (h00, 100, 200 and 300) and π–π stacking peaks (010) was stronger in the parallel direction to the substrate for the DR3TSBDT films than for the DR3TBDTT films. This was particularly apparent in the line-cut profiles (Fig. 4e and f). The data indicated that the DR3TSBDT packing domains were more ordered with higher and larger crystallinity.20 To support this proposal, the compound crystallite size was calculated from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of a (200) lamellar peak using Scherrer's formula21 in eqn (1), as follows: τ (crystal size) = Kλ/FWHMcosθ(1)where K is a dimensionless shape factor equal to 0.9 and λ is the X-ray wavelength (see Fig. 4e, inset). The estimated crystallite sizes for DR3TBDTT and DR3TSBDT were 52.3 and 71.8 Å, respectively, which supported the 2D-GIWAXS analysis.
However, a noteworthy difference in the 2D-GIWAXS data was observed between the pure active film and the blend films. The lamellar (h00) peaks were quite weak, particularly the (300) scattering peak and the complete isotropic halo peak at qxy,z = ca. 1.4 Å−1 that was observed for both blends. This demonstrates that the presence of excess PC71BM interrupted the self-assembly of lamellar stacks of the donor compounds.22
Pole figure analysis of the active films was done to gain quantitative insight into the orientation. Fig. 5 shows the pole figures extracted from the lamellar (100) and (200) diffractions of the 2D-GIWAXS patterns for all of the pure and blended active films (the insets are close-ups of the lamellar diffraction patterns). The relative population of the edge-on orientation was distinctly larger in the DR3TBDTT system in both the (100) and (200) orientations (Fig. 5a and b). That is, DR3TSBDT had a greater tendency for face-on orientation. The pole figure analysis and 2D-GIWAXS patterns indicated that the crystalline order was higher and had more face-on directionality in the pristine DR3TSBDT films than in the corresponding DR3TBDTT films.
 Fig. 5  Pole figures extracted from the lamellar diffraction of the (100) (a and c) and (200) (b and d) scattered intensities. The first row corresponds to the pristine small molecule films and the second row to the small molecule:PC71BM blend films. 
Surprisingly, the opposite orientation behavior of the crystallites was found for the blended active films. The face-on crystallite population was higher for the DR3TBDTT heterojunction, whereas the edge-on crystallites were more abundant in the DR3TSBDT system. This explains the higher performances for the DR3TBDTT-based devices, i.e., the relatively more enriched backbone orientation of the DR3TBDTT crystallites in the bulk blend films is a favorable structure in photovoltaic architectures because it facilitates more efficient vertical carrier movement.23,24 To our knowledge, this work is the first reported molecular orientation analysis of sulfur-and/or thiophene-containing small compounds.
The combined 2D-GIWAXS scattering and pole figure analyses revealed the 3D molecular arrangement of two different active compounds in both single and heterojunction films (Fig. 6). The schematic drawings show how higher device performances resulted from the completely opposite crystalline packing structures that were observed for the pure film and blends and in the DR3TBDTT blend system that had a more oriented backbone containing the donor compound.

Charge transport properties
The charge carrier mobilities of the active films in the direction perpendicular to the substrate plane were evaluated using hole-only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au) and electron-only (Al/active layer/Al) devices. The small-molecule neat film was also evaluated in the hole-only device. Detailed device fabrication and measurement procedures are reported in the Experimental section. Hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities were extracted using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) model.
From the J–V curves of hole-only diodes (Fig. 7a), the value of μh for the DR3TBDTT net film was 9.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while that for the DR3TSBDT pristine film was 1.17 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. These hole mobilities largely support the above morphological arguments: (1) the higher crystallinity of the DR3TSBDT compounds led to larger packing domains, which enabled a higher charge carrier mobility and (2) the more favorable backbone orientation of DR3TSBDT clearly resulted in enhanced vertical charge transport.25,26

For the blend films (Fig. 7b), however, the higher charge mobility for hole carrier transport was observed in the DR3TBDTT systems (μh of 3.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 compared with 2.01 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for DR3TSBDT:PC71BM), which are heterojunction films, whereas the enriched face-on orientation of the DR3TBDTT compound resulted in more efficient vertical hole transport than in the DR3TSBDT blends.27 A smaller μh/μe value was found for the DR3TBDTT devices (μh/μe = 1.39 for DR3TBDTT:PC71BM and μh/μe = 2.24 for DR3TSBDT:PC71BM). These results indicated well-balanced hole and electron transport in the DR3TBDTT:PC71BM blend films and explained the high photovoltaic performance, particularly the FF values, of the DR3TBDTT cells.28
Effect of nanoscale morphological properties on Jsc and FF
The photocurrent density Jph(V) was analyzed by a charge collection model to investigate how different nanostructured packing orientations affected the charge collection efficiency. The model is given in eqn (2):29,30 Jph(V) = GηAηEDηCTηcc(V)(2)where V is the applied voltage in the device, G is the incident light intensity, ηA is the absorption efficiency of the photons in the active films, ηED is the exciton diffusion efficiency for the excitons to diffuse to the donor–acceptor interface, ηCT is the charge transfer efficiency, and ηcc is the charge collection efficiency for the probability of charge collection of the separated carriers. Within the framework of charge carrier collection, ηcc in eqn (2) can be expressed as eqn (3): ηcc(V) = Jph(V)/Jph,sat(3)where Jph,sat is the current density at full charge collection, which is expected to occur at sufficiently large reverse bias and is determined according to eqn (4):31 Jph(V) = Jph,sat(VBI − V)f[1 − exp(−1/(VBI − V)f)](4)where VBI is the built-in potential and f is the charge collection parameter. The values of Jph,sat are obtained by fitting the experimental J–V curves (Fig. 8a).
 Fig. 8  (a) Steady-state photo-illuminated J–V characteristics (points: experimental data; solid lines: fitted data), (b) short-circuit current density Jsc and (c) fill factor (FF) as a function of light intensity for the DR3TBDTT:PC71BM and DR3TSBDT:PC71BM devices. 
Under short circuit conditions, ηcc(0) is equal to the short circuit current/saturated current ratio Jsc/Jph,sat. The charge collection efficiency ηcc(0) is under the short-circuit conditions and is a parameter that describes the charge collection process of a device.32 In our systems, the Jph,sat values estimated using eqn (4) were 17.50 and 17.11 mA cm−2 for the DR3TBDTT:PC71BM and DR3TSBDT:PC71BM devices, respectively, and thus we obtained Jph(V)/Jph,sat values of 75.1 and 69.4% for the DR3TBDTT:PC71BM:PC71BM and DR3TSBDT:PC71BM photovoltaic cells, respectively. The Jph(V)/Jph,sat values indicated that the DR3TBDTT:PC71BM devices, with their more dominant face-on orientation of the donor compound, exhibited higher charge collection efficiency. Overall, its backbone orientation was beneficial for charge collection and for charge transfer to the electrodes, which should result when less non-geminate recombination occurs. The consequence was a higher JSC and FF for the DR3TBDTT:PC71BM devices.33
The JSC and FF factors were plotted as a function of light intensity to reveal the charge recombination kinetics (Fig. 8b and c). Notably, for both the DR3TBDTT:PC71BM and DR3TSBDT:PC71BM devices, Jsc increased linearly with the light intensity when the number of free carriers increased. However, the photovoltaic properties of the DR3TBDTT:PC71BM cells showed a more linear dependence of Jsc on light intensity; the data were fit by the power law JSC ∝ Iα where I is the light intensity and the coefficient α = 0.921.34 In comparison, a coefficient of α = 0.864 was used to fit the data for the DR3TSBDT:PC71BM devices. The deviation from α = 1 was attributed to non-geminate recombination and space charge effects, which are associated with sweep-out under short-circuit conditions.35 Therefore, sweep-out at short-circuit is more efficient and non-geminate recombination is relatively weak in the DR3TBDTT-based devices.
Also, it was clear that the decrease in FF with increasing light intensity was milder for the DR3TBDTT:PC71BM cells than for the DR3TSBDT:PC71BM devices. This difference in FF behavior implied that non-geminate recombination was weaker in the DR3TBDTT-based cell, which is consistent with the above analysis and is one of the reasons for the higher FF in the DR3TBDTT:PC71BM cell.36
Conclusions
Modification of the molecular orientation by atomic substitution in donor/acceptor heterojunctions was observed for two different small molecule:fullerene-based BHJ devices. For the pure systems, DR3TSBDT molecules containing sulfur atoms in the side chains (alkylthio groups) were more oriented and had larger crystalline packing structures with a relatively enriched face-on distribution than DR3TBDTT compounds. Surprisingly, however, the larger population of donor compound crystallites with a favorable backbone orientation distribution along the perpendicular direction in the DR3TBDTT heterojunction textures resulted in efficient charge transport to the vertical hole flow and a reduction in charge recombination. Therefore, much higher device performances were measured for the DR3TBDTT:PC71BM devices.
These detailed studies have characterized the fundamental effects of molecular orientation of sulfur-containing small molecules in active films. The combination of complete characterization and analysis constitutes a major advance in the predictive design of high-performing small-molecule solar cells and molecularly designed heterojunction textures.
Experimental section
Materials
The compounds known as DR3TBDTT and DR3TSBDT were purchased from 1-Material, Inc. and used without further purification. [6,6]-Phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) was purchased from Nano-C Co., Ltd. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Baytron P VP AI 4083) was obtained from Electronic Materials Index Co., Ltd.
Thin film characterization
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were obtained using a Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR double-beam spectrophotometer. Samples were studied by AFM in the tapping mode on a Digital Instruments Multimode IIIa. Images (5 μm × 5 μm) were collected in air using silicon probes with a typical spring constant of 1–5 nN m−1. The 2D-GIWAXS measurements were performed using the PLS-II 3C beamline at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) in Korea. The samples were prepared on PEDOT:PSS-modified Si substrates under the same conditions as those used for the fabrication of the solar cell devices. The X-rays emitted from the in-vacuum undulator (IVU) were monochromated (E = 11.03 keV) using Si(111) double crystals and then focused at the detector position using a K–B focusing mirror system. The horizontal and vertical beam sizes were 200 and 30 μm, respectively. The incidence angle (αi) was adjusted to 0.10–0.13°, which was above the critical angle. The 2D-GIWAXS patterns were recorded with a 2D charge-coupled device (CCD) detector (Rayonix SX-165) and the sample-to-detector distance (SDD) was 222.34 mm.
Device fabrication
Small-molecule solar cells were fabricated using ITO-coated glass as a positive electrode and Al as a negative electrode in the conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor compound:PC71BM/Al. The ITO-coated glass was pre-cleaned sequentially with aqueous detergent, deionized water, acetone and 2-propanol. The ITO/glass was then treated with UV-ozone for 20 min. A ca. 35 nm-thick PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated from an aqueous dispersion onto the ITO glass substrate at 4000 rpm. The coated substrate was then baked at 120 °C for 20 min in an oven. Subsequently, a chloroform solution (20 mg mL−1) of the small molecule:PC71BM (1:0.8 w/w) blend was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a ca. 110 nm-thick layer. The samples were then dried at room temperature under vacuum. Finally, 100 nm of Al was thermally evaporated as the cathode in a high vacuum at a base pressure of 2 × 10−6 Torr.
For hole-only devices, the diode was fabricated with a ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au configuration using a process similar to that used for the photovoltaic cells described above. Only the cathode electrode (Au, 100 nm) was different for the solar cell device; it was vacuum-deposited on the active layer (2 × 10−6 Torr). The electron-only devices were fabricated with an Al/active layer/Al structure. The bottom Al layer was for electron extraction, and the top Al layer was an electron-injecting electrode. Both Al layers were also vacuum-deposited (2 × 10−6 Torr).
Device characterization
The current–voltage characteristics of the photovoltaics were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2. A xenon light source coupled with an AM 1.5 optical filter was used as the light source to illuminate the surface of the devices. External quantum efficiencies (EQE) were measured using a Merlin photomodulation spectroscopic setup (Oriel), a calibrated Si UV detector, and an SR570 low-noise current amplifier. A silicon reference diode (Hamamatsu S1337) was used to calibrate the setup. The J–V characteristics of the single carrier devices were measured in the range of 0–3 V using a Keithley 2400 source measuring unit in the dark. The carrier mobility was calculated by fitting the J–V curves to a space charge limited current model, described by eqn (5) as follows: (5)where ε0 is the permittivity of the free space, εr is the dielectric constant of the material, μ is the charge carrier mobility, Vappl is the applied voltage to the device, Vbi is the built-in voltage resulting from the difference in work functions of the two electrodes, β is the field activation factor and L is the film thickness of the active layer.
