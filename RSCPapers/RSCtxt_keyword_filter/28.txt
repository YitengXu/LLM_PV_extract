Decreasing the amount of a diastereomer of β-[70]PCBM with high aggregation tendency (β1-[70]PCBM) improved the photovoltaic performances.
Fullerene derivatives are excellent electron-accepting materials in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices,1 whereas high-performance non-fullerene electron acceptors have recently emerged as viable alternatives.2 The spherical structure of fullerenes provides the small reorganization energy in electron transfer, and thereby superior electron-accepting and electron-transporting properties.3 A prototypical fullerene derivative is [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester ([60]PCBM).4 Its [70]fullerene analogue ([70]PCBM) has been preferentially employed in high-performance OPVs over [60]PCBM because of better light-harvesting ability in the visible region and solubility in organic solvents arising from the rugby ball shape with lower symmetry.5 High power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 8–11% have been achieved using [70]PCBM in combination with various low-bandgap conjugated polymers.6,7 However, the lower symmetric C70 cage has four distinct types of double bonds (α, β, δ, and ε, Fig. 1), and mono-addition reactions to C70 generally yield a regioisomer mixture product. In fact, [70]PCBM prepared via a conventional method using 4-benzoylbutyrate tosylhydrazone and C70 contains α-type (80–90%) and β-type (10–20%) isomers.5,8–11 Despite its prevalence use in OPV devices, [70]PCBM is usually used as the isomer mixture, which veils the device performances depending on the individual isomers of [70]PCBM.

Recently, we reported the first attempt to investigate the regioisomer effect of [70]PCBM on photovoltaic properties, in combination with poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT, Fig. S1, ESI†), an amorphous conjugated polymer.9a An improvement of the device performance by regioisomer separation was observed; OPVs based on α-type and β-type isomers showed higher PCEs (6.20% and 6.46%, respectively) than devices with [70]PCBM consisting of 88% α-isomer and 12% β-isomer (denoted as mix-[70]PCBM, PCE: 5.59%). It should be noted here that the α-isomer of [70]PCBM is composed of two enantiomers, while the β-isomer consists of two diastereomers in which the phenyl group is protruding toward the pole direction (denoted as β1-[70]PCBM) or the equator direction (denoted as β2-[70]PCBM) (Fig. 1b). We previously obtained the enantiomerically pure (R)- and (S)-α-[70]PCBM (Fig. S2, ESI†) and found that the enantiomer separation had no significant effect on the photovoltaic properties.9b On the other hand, Zhan and coworkers separated the β-isomer of [70]PCBM into diastereomerically pure β1- and β2-[70]PCBM. Their results revealed that OPV devices based on a conjugated polymer donor (poly[(4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-benzo(1,2-b:4,5-b′)dithiophene)-2,6-diyl-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl]) (PTB7), (Fig. S1, ESI†) with α-, β1-, and β2-[70]PCBM showed lower PCEs (6.04%, 1.28%, and 4.17%, respectively) than the device with the isomer mixture (α:β1:β2 = 8:1:1, PCE = 7.44%).10a These results suggest that the isomer separations of [70]fullerene mono-adducts significantly affect the performance of OPV devices, but do not always have positive effects. Therefore, the isomer effect of [70]fullerene mono-adducts on the performance of OPV devices with conjugated polymers still remains elusive.
In this study, we utilized poly[(5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4,7-diyl)-alt-(3,3′′′-di(2-octyldodecyl)-2,2′;5′,2′′;5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophen-5,5′′′-diyl)] (PffBT4T-2OD; Fig. S1, ESI†), which showed the highest PCE of polymer:[70]PCBM-based OPVs.7 Recently, Martín et al. selectively synthesized α-[70]PCBM and fabricated an OPV device based on PffBT4T-2OD:α-[70]PCBM, as well as a device with PffBT4T-2OD:mix-[70]PCBM; the preliminary results showed rather discouraging, comparable PCE values (6.63 ± 0.72% and 6.45 ± 0.66%, respectively).11a Nevertheless, we thought that comprehensive investigations into the effects of the regioisomer and diastereomer separation on the structures and photovoltaic properties of PffBT4T-2OD:[70]PCBM would be very useful to elucidate the intrinsic isomer effects. In this study, we systematically used α-, β1-, and β2-[70]PCBM, mix-[70]PCBM, and a mixture of β1- and β2-[70]PCBM before the diastereomer separation (denoted as mix-β-[70]PCBM). Although the excellent performance of PffBT4T-2OD is generally attributed to a strong tendency to form robust bicontinuous polymer–fullerene nanostructures that are independent of choice of fullerene acceptor,7 the β1-isomer of [70]PCBM showing the high aggregation tendency has a negative impact on the film structures and photovoltaic performance.
Recycling high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was conducted with a Cosmosil 5PBB column to separate mix-[70]PCBM into α-[70]PCBM and mix-β-[70]PCBM as reported in the literature.9,10 The sample of mix-β-[70]PCBM was then subjected to the HPLC with the same column to obtain β1-[70]PCBM and β2-[70]PCBM (Fig. S3, ESI†).10a The purity of each sample was estimated using 1H NMR spectra and found to be considerably high (>94%, Fig. S4, ESI†). The solubility tests in standard organic solvents for OPV device fabrication, i.e. chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), revealed that the β-isomers possess lower solubilities than the α-isomer (Table 1). Intriguingly, both of β1- and β2-isomers show lower solubilities than their mixture, mix-β-[70]PCBM. Separation of the two diastereomers with close but not the same structures may enhance their tendency to form insoluble large aggregates to some extent. Especially, β1-[70]PCBM is poorly soluble. Flash-photolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements were conducted to estimate the intrinsic electron-transporting properties of the fullerene films.9a Surprisingly, the maximum values of transient photo-conductivity (ϕ∑μ), where ϕ is the quantum efficiency of charge separation (CS) and ∑μ is the sum of the mobilities of all the transient charge carriers, are comparable ((2.7–3.9) × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table 1)). This result indicates that the intrinsic electron mobilities of the fullerene films are basically similar despite the difference in the substituent positions and directions on the C70 surface, assuming that the ϕ values are comparable in the fullerene neat films.

BHJ OPV devices were fabricated with an inverted configuration of ITO/ZnO/PffBT4T-2OD:fullerene/MoO3/Al to evaluate the regioisomer and diastereomer effects of [70]PCBM on their photovoltaic performances. The detailed device fabrication procedure is described in the ESI. The formation conditions such as solvent, concentration, and preheating temperature of the PffBT4T-2OD:fullerene solution, as well as the amount of an additive (1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)), were optimized for each device. Current density–voltage curves from the best-performing devices are shown in Fig. 2a. The best-performing photovoltaic parameters and the averaged values with standard deviations from ten independent devices are summarized in Table 2. The average PCE value of the OPV device based on PffBT4T-2OD:mix-[70]PCBM (8.2%) is comparable to other results reported in the literature.7,12 The open-circuit voltage (VOC) values are virtually the same (Table 2). This result reflects the similar LUMO energy levels of the fullerenes (Table 1).10a However, the device with PffBT4T-2OD:β1-[70]PCBM exhibits an extremely low, average short-circuit current density (JSC, 1.3 mA cm−2) and results in a poor average PCE (0.39%) compared to other devices (JSC = 15.7–16.1 mA cm−2, PCE = 7.9–8.4%). In accordance with the lower JSC, the incident photon-to-current efficiencies (IPCEs) of the device with β1-[70]PCBM are lower than those of other devices (Fig. 2b).

The convolution of the spectral response in (b) with the photon flux of the AM 1.5G spectrum provided the estimated JSC values of 14.6, 14.3, 14.3, 1.2, and 14.5 mA cm−2, respectively.

Light absorption in the blend films of PffBT4T-2OD with mix-, α-, mix-β-, and β2-[70]PCBM is sufficiently high (ca. 80%) throughout the visible region (Fig. S5, ESI†). However, the spectrum of PffBT4T-2OD:β1-[70]PCBM shows a relatively low absorption at the shorter wavelengths (<600 nm) (Fig. S5, ESI†). The shape of the IPCE spectrum from the OPV device based on PffBT4T-2OD:β1-[70]PCBM (Fig. S6, ESI†) is consistent with the absorption spectrum. The reduced absorption can be attributed to the smaller fullerene concentration in PffBT4T-2OD:β1-[70]PCBM compared to the other blend films. The lower solubility of β1-[70]PCBM (Table 1) may result in poor film formation properties.
In a quest for a clear explanation regarding the poor performance of the device with PffBT4T-2OD:β1-[70]PCBM, the film structures of the photoactive layers were examined with an optical microscope. As shown in Fig. 3, aggregates with sizes up to several tens of micrometers are formed in the PffBT4T-2OD:β1-[70]PCBM film solely. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) also visualizes the formation of a ten micrometer-sized agglomeration in the PffBT4T-2OD:β1-[70]PCBM film (Fig. S7, ESI†). Similar large aggregates are absent in the other blended films, suggesting the β1-[70]PCBM molecules are susceptible to self-aggregation in PffBT4T-2OD:β1-[70]PCBM. These results imply that a bicontinuous network structure of donor and acceptor domains was poorly formed in the blend film of PffBT4T-2OD:β1-[70]PCBM. Such large aggregate formation is unique because it is known that PffBT4T-2OD tends to construct a robust bicontinuous polymer–fullerene structure with domain sizes of a few tens of nanometers, leading to high-performance OPVs.7 Only the β1-isomer of [70]PCBM has an exceptionally strong cohesive nature even in the blend film with PffBT4T-2OD. In other words, the position and direction of an appended group on a C70 cage have an intense influence on the intermolecular interaction between the polymer and fullerene as well as fullerene and fullerene.
 Fig. 3  Optical microscopy images of the blend films of PffBT4T-2OD with (a) mix-[70]PCBM, (b) α-[70]PCBM, (c) mix-β-[70]PCBM, (d) β1-[70]PCBM, and (e) β2-[70]PCBM on ITO/ZnO substrates. Scale bars represent 100 μm. 
The molecular packing structures in the blend films were examined via X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses (Fig. S8, ESI†). The XRD patterns of all the blend films exhibit (l00) reflections, indicating a well-organized lamellar structure of PffBT4T-2OD. Meanwhile, the PffBT4T-2OD:β1-[70]PCBM film shows a sharp diffraction peak at q = 1.22 Å−1 corresponding to the fullerene core packing, whereas the other blend films exhibit a broad peak centered at q = 1.14 Å−1. This result implies more dense and ordered packing of fullerenes in the PffBT4T-2OD:β1-[70]PCBM film than in the other blend films. The densely packed structure of fullerene cages was also observed in a single crystal of β1-[70]PCBM, whereas α-[70]PCBM and β2-[70]PCBM show relatively loose packing (Fig. S9, ESI†).9a,b,10a Importantly, the strong intermolecular interaction of β1-[70]PCBM relative to the other [70]PCBM isomers increases the density of the fullerene aggregates as well as the size.
To investigate the diffusion efficiency of the excitons generated in the polymer domain to the polymer–fullerene interface, we measured the steady-state photoluminescence of the blend films (Fig. S10, ESI†). The emission from PffBT4T-2OD was quenched efficiently (90–97%) in all the blend films. Even the PffBT4T-2OD:β1-[70]PCBM film showed 90% quenching relative to the PffBT4T-2OD single component film. This result suggests that β1-[70]PCBM molecules also exist outside the large aggregates, and that most of the excitons generated by polymer absorption were quenched by the β1-[70]PCBM molecules scattered across the polymer domain. However, such quenching did not contribute to the photocurrent generation because of the absence of an electron-transporting pathway to the electrode.
The electron and hole mobilities of the blend films of PffBT4T-2OD with mix-, α-, mix-β-, and β2-[70]PCBM estimated via the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method are comparable ((2.6–3.7) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electron mobilities and (7.8–9.0) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for hole mobilities, Table 2), reflecting the similar intrinsic electron mobilities of the fullerenes (Table 1) and the virtually identical polymer packing structure (Fig. S8, ESI†). However, the performance of the OPV device with mix-β-[70]PCBM is relatively low (Table 2). Although the micrometer-sized aggregation of β1-[70]PCBM was suppressed by the coexistence of a comparable amount of β2-[70]PCBM in mix-β-[70]PCBM, the surface roughness of PffBT4T-2OD:mix-β-[70]PCBM was still high (rms = 4.9 nm) in comparison with those of PffBT4T-2OD:mix-[70]PCBM, PffBT4T-2OD:α-[70]PCBM and PffBT4T-2OD:β2-[70]PCBM (rms = 3.0–3.4 nm) (Table 2). The slightly low PCE value of the device with mix-β-[70]PCBM may be attributed to the formation of undesirable nanometer-sized aggregates of β1-[70]PCBM. Overall, the existence of β1-[70]PCBM in the PffBT4T-2OD:[70]PCBM films deteriorates the photovoltaic performances in the OPV devices.
In summary, we have established for the first time the comprehensive regioisomer and diastereomer separation effect of the most prevalent electron-acceptor ([70]PCBM) on the structures and photovoltaic properties of the blend films with a high-performance conjugated polymer (PffBT4T-2OD). In spite of the strong tendency of PffBT4T-2OD to form a bicontinuous structure with fullerene derivatives, one of the diastereomers of the β-isomer (β1-[70]PCBM) showed an extraordinary cohesion nature in the blend film, deteriorating the OPV device performance. OPV devices based on the other isomers, i.e. α-[70]PCBM (8.4%) and β2-[70]PCBM (8.4%), rival or slightly surpass the device with the as-synthesized isomer mixture (mix-[70]PCBM, 8.2%) because of the absence of the poor performance β1-[70]PCBM. These results contrast markedly with the case of the high-performance polymer (PTB7), where the isomer mixture (α:β1:β2 = 8:1:1) of [70]PCBM (average PCE = 7.44%) outperformed the regioisomerically or diastereomerically pure [70]PCBM (1.28–6.04%).10a The information obtained in this study demonstrates the large impact of the substituent position and direction on a C70 surface on the photovoltaic properties and the necessity for the exploration of the best-matching isomers of [70]PCBM with respect to high-performance photovoltaic conjugated polymers. At the current stage, C70 derivatives, especially isomer-pure ones, are expensive and hard-to-get compared to major classes of industrial organic dyes and pigments such as phthalocyanines and indigos.13 In terms of sustainability, however, nanocarbon materials including C70 derivatives have potentials to contribute toward next-generation energy supply systems because carbon nanostructures will be readily obtained from natural products in the near future.14 Therefore the results obtained in this study motivate further investigation and will help drive progress in the field of fullerene-based OPV devices.
