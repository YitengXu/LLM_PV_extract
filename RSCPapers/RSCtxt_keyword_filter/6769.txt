    , Accepted 20th July 2020First published on 20th July 2020AbstractA new method has been developed for surface treatment of TiO2 photoanodes with LiI/NaI to enhance the photocurrent and, subsequently, the performance efficiency of the fabricated dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Three different concentrations (0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mmol%) of LiI and NaI solutions were used to investigate the effect of this surface treatment on the device performance of DSSCs. A positive shift in the energy level of TiO2 has been experienced by surface treated devices, which is predominantly supported by the decrease in VOC. Furthermore, the introduction of LiI/NaI onto the TiO2 surface resulted in a reduction in the crystallite size, indicating an increase in the surface area which helps in more dye adsorption leading to higher JSC values of the devices. Besides, modification of the conduction band energy level, it also allows a fast electron injection process by shifting the density of states. Thus, this approach offers a simple but efficient route to enhance the photocurrent and efficiency of DSSCs.
Introduction
TiO2 is employed as a photoanode material due to its efficient electron transport, long excited electron lifetime, and importantly chemical stability, non-toxicity, and low-cost. In dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), it plays an important role by accepting electrons from the photo-excited dye molecules. The desired photoanode layer in DSSCs should adsorb large amounts of the dye molecule, and have faster electron transport and enhanced electron lifetime.1 The electron injection process has been considered as a key determinant towards the generation of the photocurrent in DSSCs,2 and this can be instigated by modifying the conduction band edge of the photoanode material via doping,1 surface treatment,3–6etc. In recent years, doping of TiO2 has attracted much attention because doping can improve the optical and electrical properties of TiO2 and subsequently the overall performance of DSSCs by modifying the conduction band energy level of TiO2. Fig. 1a represents the band diagram of TiO2 in which the conduction band is made from Ti(3d) orbitals and the valence band is made of O(2p) orbitals. Fig. 1b shows the schematic representation of the decrease in the open-circuit voltage (VOC) due to the band bending effect in DSSCs. The defect species Ti3+ are present below the conduction band around 0.5 eV, which can act as an n-type dopant and in turn increase the number of free electrons thereby enhancing the conductivity and photocurrent.

The conduction band edge of TiO2 determines the driving force for electron injection and the generation of photovoltage in DSSCs. Doping of TiO2 with metals and non-metals can tailor the electrical properties of TiO2 by introducing energy states into the conduction band thereby influencing the light absorbance and electron transfer.1 The negative shift in the conduction band showed an increase in VOC of the device while at the same time the positive shift in the conduction band resulted in a decrease in VOC of the device. For example, surface treatment of TiO2 with LA (lithium acetate) has shifted the conduction band of TiO2 upwards (negative shift) which is responsible for the increase in the VOC of the same device.4
From the device point of view, TiO2 has a suitable band energy level which helps in the injection and extraction of electrons from the dye molecules. But at the same time, the tunable energy levels and optical properties of TiO2 can allow researchers to improve the optical and electrical properties of TiO2 depending upon the application. This can be done via surface modification or doping of TiO2. Concerning DSSCs, a handful of literature studies are available regarding the different approaches such as surface modification of the TiO2 layer with Ba(NO3)2, Mg(NO3)2 with O2 plasma treatment, acid treatment, NH4OH treatment, and lithium acetate incorporation to improve the device performance.3–6 From the previously reported literature, it was observed that the surface modification of the TiO2 layer helped in shifting the conduction band energy level,4 provided with additional dye adsorption sites and suppression of electron recombination reactions.3 Interestingly, the hydroxyl groups can be introduced by treating the TiO2 film with NH4OH for better dye adsorption6 and the increased hydroxyl groups thereby introduce more Ti–O–Ti bonds, which improve the adherence of the dye molecule onto the TiO2 surface. In addition, high dye loading was observed when the TiO2 surface was treated with oxalic acid owing to the binding of the dye molecule via O− of the bidentate bridged oxalate ion on the TiO2 surface compared to the untreated TiO2 surface.7
The first principles study of doping TiO2 with Na+ and Li+ showed the modification of the electrical properties of TiO2via a change in the conduction band edge.8 In the same way, the doping of TiO2 with a non-metal leads to the improvement in the visible light absorption, conductivity, and open-circuit voltage (VOC) of solar cells.9 Even though the shifting of the conduction band via doping of TiO2 improved the device performance by efficient electron transport, the presence of Li+10 and tertiary butyl pyridine (tBP)11 in the electrolyte can influence the performance of DSSCs by shifting the conduction band energy level of TiO2. Likewise, many reports12–15 are available that support the enhanced electrical properties of TiO2 and changes in the photovoltaic parameters such as VOC, JSC and subsequently the performance of the devices. Furthermore, the presence of cations such as Li+, Na+, and Mg2+ in the electrolyte helps in shifting the conduction band energy level, hence they are termed as the potential determining cations.16,17 Studies revealed that pH is also considered as one of the influencing parameters to shift the conduction band energy level of TiO2.18 Interestingly, the molecule as a whole can be doped on TiO2 as this will have both donor and acceptor levels which can inject electrons and/or holes into the conduction band energy levels thereby modifying the band energy level of TiO2. Wickramanayake et al.19 studied the doping effect of LiI and NaI into anatase TiO2 and observed the changes in the electrical properties of TiO2. Hence in this work, alkali metal iodides (LiI or NaI) were employed to modify the TiO2 conduction band edge to observe the changes in the DSSC performance by employing N719 dye. Such a shift in the conduction band energy level by a foreign molecule through doping of TiO2 can influence the photovoltaic parameter VOC. Therefore, LiI or NaI has been chosen as the dopant and it was introduced into the TiO2 film via surface treatment. Furthermore, the influence of the modified TiO2 photoanode with LiI or NaI on the photovoltaic parameters (VOC, JSC, and FF) is witnessed by fabricating DSSCs with the LiI or NaI treated TiO2 photoanode employing N3 dye as well.
Results and discussions
The crystal structures of pure TiO2, LiI or NaI treated TiO2 samples (0.1, 0.25, 0.5 mmol%) are characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and the plots are shown in Fig. 2. Sample code T represents bare TiO2, and L1, L2, and L3 represent 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mmol% LiI treated TiO2, and N1, N2, and N3 represent 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mmol% NaI treated TiO2, respectively.

TiO2 (P25) commercial nanopowder contains both anatase and rutile phase composition and their characteristic peaks are observed as shown in Fig. 2.20 The LiI/NaI treated TiO2 films showing a similar XRD pattern to TiO2 suggests that the introduction of LiI/NaI onto the TiO2 film did not cause any change in the crystal structure or no phase change in the TiO2 crystal lattice. But at the same time, a decrease in the crystallite size and an increase in the crystal lattice strain are observed from the XRD pattern of the LiI/NaI treated TiO2 samples (Table S1 in ESI†). The decrease in the crystallite size might favor more dye accommodation onto the TiO2 surface which leads to higher light absorption resulting in higher current densities. Debye–Scherrer's formula is employed to obtain the crystallite size of the samples. The formula is as follows21 (1)where D represents the crystallite size, K represents the shape factor (0.9), λ represents the wavelength of Cu Kα radiation and βhkl represents the instrumental broadening. The lattice strain associated with both untreated and LiI/NaI treated TiO2 samples have been calculated using the following formula21 (2)where ε is the strain factor.
The change in the crystal lattice was further investigated by the Raman study (Fig. 3a–d) of both LiI/NaI treated TiO2 and bare TiO2 films. As shown in Fig. 3b and d, a slight red-shift in the peaks at 140 cm−1 for LiI/NaI treated samples is observed. This suggests that the decrease in the crystallite size and the increase in the crystal lattice strain caused by the LiI/NaI in the TiO2 lattice influence the Raman peak shift which is supported by the crystallite size and strain calculated from the XRD spectra of T, L1, L2, L3, N1, N2, and N3 samples (Table S1, ESI†).

From the FT-IR spectra of the pure and LiI/NaI treated TiO2 samples (Fig. S1a–c, ESI†), the peaks around 3400 cm−1 and 1630 cm−1 represent the stretching and bending vibrations of –OH bonds. The broad FT-IR peaks around 550–800 cm−1 correspond to Ti–O and Ti–O–Ti bridging in the stretching mode of vibration.22 For the pure TiO2 sample, a broad peak around 550–800 cm−1 (522, 550, and 626 cm−1) (inset of Fig. S1a, ESI†) is observed, but for the LiI/NaI treated TiO2 samples (Fig. S1a, ESI†) only –OH bond vibrations are noticed and further no such broadband around 550–800 cm−1 indicating the doping effect.1 When the surface of the semiconducting material is excited with the wavelength (larger than its bandgap), electrons are excited from the valence band to the conduction band leaving a hole in the valence band. These electrons and holes are recombined by emitting photons and phonons. The radiative recombination processes can be investigated by Photoluminescence (PL) studies. The emission peak present in the visible region of 437 nm has been attributed to the anatase phase of TiO2.23 At the same time, the three emission peaks located at 415, 437, and 465 nm correspond to self-trapped exciton recombination and oxygen-related defect centers.23,24 The enhancement of PL intensity compared to the bare TiO2 is attributed to the effect of surface treatment of TiO2. The PL intensity increase also demonstrates the increase in oxygen vacancies of the surface treated samples as the concentration of the LiI/NaI increases. Furthermore, it is obvious that the reduction in the crystallite size (refer Table S1, ESI†) indicates the increase in the surface area which ends up with more oxygen vacancies in the surface treated TiO2 layer causing the PL intensity to increase.25 Moreover, the increase in PL intensity confirms the radiative recombination of the electron and hole pairs rather than the non-radiative path. The higher the recombination of electrons and holes, the larger the PL intensity resulted high charge density at the surface treated TiO2 photoanode which eventually improves the VOC values in the devices.26,27 There are also reports available in the literature to understand the band bending effect by PL measurement.28 From Fig. 4a and b, one can observe that the increase in the PL intensity, which suggests the presence of electron donor molecules on the surface of the TiO2, is further supported by the small bandgap changes observed in the LiI/NaI treated samples (Fig. S2a and b, ESI†). The ionization potential of the adsorbed molecule on the surface of TiO2 also plays a role in the increase or decrease in PL intensity. The presence of Li+ cations in the oxidized dye led to a redshift in the absorption spectra.29 In the same context, here, the LiI/NaI treated TiO2/N719 dye samples show a redshift in the absorption spectra (Fig. S3, ESI†), which strongly supports the enhanced light-harvesting efficiency of the surface-treated samples.

The pH of the zero point charge (pHZPC) study conducted for the pure TiO2 and LiI/NaI treated TiO2 samples and the plot of pHinitialvs. pHfinal values are shown in the following Fig. 4c and d using the pH drift method. As can be observed, the pHZPC values of the NaI treated TiO2 samples are increased from 7.1 (untreated TiO2) to 7.9 (0.1 and 0.25 mmol% NaI) including 0.5 mmol% NaI which shows a pHZPC value of 7.6. The pH value of the dye solution is found to be 6.7. It is believed that the presence of OH ions on the surface of TiO2 may enhance the dye adsorption.6 All the samples showing pHZPC values higher than the pH value of the pure TiO2 indicates the influence of LiI/NaI treatment on TiO2 samples. The pHZPC values obtained are higher than that of the standard dye solution (N719) used in this work suggesting that the increase of OH− ions may favour the dye molecule adsorption onto the TiO2 surface which is also evidenced in the absorption spectrum of pure and LiI/NaI treated samples (Fig. S3, ESI†). These results show that the increase in alkalinity of the surface-treated film favours the dye molecule adsorption on the TiO2 film more easily via the carboxyl groups present in the dye. It is worth noting that this chemical treatment contributes to an improvement of the light-harvesting within the device leading to an increase in the JSC values.3 The effects of interface modification on the electron injection and recombination of the DSSCs will be further investigated by using the Mott–Schottky plot and electrochemical impedance spectra analysis.
The flat band potential (VFB) and the charge carrier concentration in a semiconductor (ND) can be evaluated by using Mott–Schottky analysis. In this framework, the interface between the semiconductor and the electrolyte can be modeled as a connection between a capacitor and a resistor in series representing the depletion layer and the solution resistance, respectively. Here, the contribution of the Helmholtz layer in the electrolyte to the interface capacitance is considered negligible.30 Therefore, the capacitance normalized to the device area is related only to the space charge region (CSC) at the interface and can be written as31 (3)where q is the elementary charge, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr ≈ 55 is the relative dielectric constant of the semiconductor,32V is the applied bias voltage, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. Here, the capacitance of the depletion layer is extracted from the imaginary part (Z′′) of the measured impedance as follows  where ω = 2πf is the angular frequency of the ac voltage perturbation.33
The plot of 1/CSC2 as a function of the applied potential at 100 Hz for the fabricated devices is shown in Fig. 5. As can be observed, there are two different slopes: the larger one is related to the TiO2 layer, whereas, the smaller one is essentially due to the FTO layer. Usually, the bare FTO is considered as a degenerate semiconductor with its behaviour similar to a metal electrode. However when a formation of the depletion layer at the interface of FTO/electrolyte occurs, a second slope appears, as displayed in Fig. 5. This finding, widely reported in the literature for the DSSC with the FTO/TiO2 interface,31,34 has been observed for both the doping salts employed.
 Fig. 5  Mott–Schottky plots of (a) T, L1, L2, L3, and (b) T, N1, N2, N3 samples respectively. 
By using eqn (3), the best fit of the linear part of the curves, between −0.3 V and 0.1 V, gives the VFB values with the intersection at the voltage axis. Moreover, the value of the donor density can be evaluated from the slope of the Mott–Schottky relationship. The extracted VFB and the ND values of T, L1, L2, L3, N1, N2, and N3 samples are listed in Table S2 (ESI†).
In particular, for the pristine TiO2 photoanode (namely T) the value of the flat band potential is about −0.5 V. By increasing the concentration of the LiI dopants, a slight positive shift has been observed. Moreover, the NaI doping strongly influences the TiO2 surface and, therefore, the flat band potential, showing a positive shift reaching a value of −0.29 V for the N3 sample (0.5 mmol% NaI). It is worth noting that the positive shift of VFB indicates a downward shift of conduction band edge EC of TiO2.35 As a consequence, the energy offset between the excited state (ES) of the dye and EC of TiO2 increases.36 This trend results in an increased driving force at the interface leading to an enhancement of the electron injection from the ES of the dye to the TiO2 conduction band and therefore, of the JSC value. On the other hand, since the open-circuit voltage of DSSCs is dependent on the difference between the VFB of TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte the corresponding solar cells could have a lower value of VOC.
The estimated values of ND for all solar cells prepared by using different doping conditions are reported in the range of 5.2 × 1019–1.2 × 1020 cm−3, as listed in Table S2 (ESI†). The lowest value of ND has been observed for the device with undoped TiO2 and it is in good agreement with that reported in the literature.36 Conversely, the solar cells fabricated with different surface treatments (with LiI/NaI) show an increase of the donor density compared to the reference device (T). This result is consistent with the increase of the PL intensity in doped devices, observed in Fig. 4a and b, caused by the adsorption of an electron donor molecule at the surface of the TiO2.
To evaluate the effect of the doping (LiI/NaI) on the surface, devices L2 and N3 were chosen for X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. These samples have shown the best efficiency performance according to our results. Here, the T sample has been chosen for comparison purposes. From the high-resolution XPS spectrum of Ti 2p, peaks at 458.18 eV and 463.88 eV for the T sample, 464.28 eV and 458.28 eV for the L2 sample, and 458.28 eV and 464.08 eV for the N3 sample were observed (Fig. S4c, ESI†), which correspond to 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 of Ti4+, respectively.20 The slight shift in the peaks for LiI and NaI treated TiO2 samples has been expected from the doping effect. The high-resolution spectra of XPS of O 1s (displayed in Fig. S4f, ESI†) show the peaks at 529.48, 529.58, and 529.48 eV corresponding to the linkage of Ti–O present in the bare TiO2 and LiI/NaI treated TiO2 samples. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of Li 1s, Na 1s, and I 3d corresponding to L2 and N3 is shown in Fig. S4(a, b, d and e) (ESI†). As can be observed, the low values of the peak intensity could be related to the lower concentration of LiI/NaI on the TiO2 surface.
The detailed DSSC device fabrication, materials used and methods followed are given in the ESI.† The J–V plot of the devices fabricated with T, L1, L2, L3, N1, N2, and N3 photoanodes is shown in Fig. 6a and b. The photovoltaic parameters of the DSSCs fabricated using T, L1, L2, L3, N1, N2, and N3 photoanodes consisting of N719 dye are tabulated in Table 1.

The electron recombination kinetics of the DSSCs fabricated with bare TiO2 and LiI/NaI treated TiO2 photoanodes are studied by EIS analysis. The EIS measurement has been conducted under dark and illumination open-circuit conditions. The corresponding Nyquist plots of the corresponding devices are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†) and the EIS parameters of those devices are tabulated in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI†). In the Nyquist plot of DSSCs, the series resistance of the device is represented by RS, and the charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface is represented by RCT1 and RCT2, which represent the charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, respectively. The ac equivalent circuit used to model the carrier dynamics within the device is shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The lowest RS value of the N3 photoanode device is responsible for the highest FF (46%) and photocurrent density (28 mA cm−2) and, therefore, the highest overall performance (% PCE of 12.3) of the device. The RS values of the devices follow the order of N1 (7.84 Ω cm2) > L3 (7.38 Ω cm2) > T (7.18 Ω cm2) > N2 (5.96 Ω cm2) > L1 (5.69 Ω cm2) > L2 (5.37 Ω cm2) > N3 (4.57 Ω cm2) which illustrates that N3 (0.5 mmol%) and L2 (0.25 mmol%) devices are far better than the T device. But at the same time, all the LiI treated TiO2 devices have similar electron lifetime values to TiO2 and they are not suffering from any form of energy barrier (refer to the J–V plot under dark conditions Fig. S7c, ESI†). The dark current in the DSSCs results from the recombination processes at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. Therefore, the increase in the dark current is attributed to the higher recombination process rate at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. The L2 device shows the lowest recombination (Fig. S7d, ESI†), which is responsible for the highest VOC value of 824 mV among the other LiI treated TiO2 samples. The highest dark current for the L3 device is consistent with the lowest VOC value (807 mV) among other LiI treated TiO2 devices. The N3 device shows the lowest RS value of 4.57 Ω cm2 compared to all other devices which are responsible for the highest JSC value of 28 mA cm−2 and the best overall performance efficiency of 12.3%. The lowest recombination reaction, as evidenced by the dark J–V plot shown in Fig. S9d (ESI†), of the N2 device is responsible for the next higher JSC value of 11.4 mA cm−2. By considering the dark current measurement of the DSSCs (Fig. S7c and S8c, ESI†), the devices exhibit a similar J–V shape of the curves indicating again that the solar cells are not affected by the energy barrier at the interface. Furthermore, the positive shift at the conduction band of TiO2 is the strong evidence from the lower VOC values of the DSSCs with NaI treated TiO2 films than the untreated TiO2 films. The VOC of the DSSCs follows the order T (829 mV) > N3 (814 mV) > N2 (810 mV) > N1 (807 mV) and T (829 mV) > L2 (824 mV) > L1 (814 mV) > L3 (807 mV). The VOC values of the NaI doped TiO2 photoanode are in the range of 807–814 mV (and for LiI treated samples 807–824 mV) which is lower than that of pure TiO2 (829 mV). These results strongly support the positive shift observed in the Mott–Schottky plots for the LiI/NaI treated TiO2 photoanode. Among the NaI treated TiO2 photoanodes, the VOC of the devices follows the order of N1 < N2 < N3 which is similar to the increasing order of PL intensity due to the high charge density at the corresponding TiO2 photoanode26,27 which validates the VOC increase observed in those devices. Still N1 shows good performance compared to the pure TiO2 photoanode suggesting the reduced recombination processes within the device. The JSC values of the DSSCs are considerably increased as the mmol% of the NaI increases but the same trend is not observed in LiI treated TiO2 samples. Among all the devices, the N3 device showed the highest JSC value of 28 mA cm−2 followed by N2 of 26 mA cm−2. The increase in JSC follows the order of N1 (24 mA cm−2) < T (24.2 mA cm−2) < N2 (26 mA cm−2) < N3 (28 mA cm−2) which strongly suggests the fast electron transport in the NaI treated TiO2 film which further enhances the overall PCE% of DSSCs. The electron lifetime calculated under dark conditions (using the formula τ = 1/2πf), where the frequency is obtained from the Bode plot (Fig. S7a and S8a, ESI†), shows that the recombination process occurs at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. The higher the electron lifetime, the lower the recombination reaction. In this study, the electron lifetime of the device T was 40.8 ms which is higher than the N2 and N3 devices having a value of 31.2 ms. However, under illumination conditions, all the devices had an 0.11 ms electron lifetime (except for N1 which showed a bit higher value of 0.14 ms) indicating the similar photovoltaic behaviour of the DSSCs. But at the same time, the higher JSC values of the NaI treated TiO2 film (comparing to untreated TiO2) strongly support the faster electron transport at the NaI treated TiO2 layer by the band bending effect rather than the reduced recombination process between the TiO2 and the electrolyte. All the LiI treated samples showed a similar electron lifetime value to the untreated TiO2 sample (40.8 ms). Under illumination conditions, it showed more or less similar electron lifetime values (0.14 for LiI treated TiO2 samples and 0.11 ms for untreated TiO2 samples). The comparison of the J–V parameters such as VOC, JSC and %PCE of all the devices is shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†).
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) study of the DSSCs gives the information about the light-harvesting properties at a particular wavelength (also referred to as the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum). The IPCE plot of the investigated samples is shown in Fig. 7a and b, respectively. Moreover, the bar graph of EQE% of DSSCs fabricated with T, L1, L2, and L3 samples is shown in Fig. 7c and the bar graph of EQE% of DSSCs fabricated with T, N1, N2, and N3 devices is shown in Fig. 7d, respectively. The EQE% of the device fabricated with a pure TiO2 sample shows the maximum value of 38.32% at 350 nm wavelength. All the LiI/NaI treated TiO2 samples show higher EQE% values compared to the pure TiO2 sample with the L1 sample showing 43.46% at 530 nm which is the highest value of all devices. This result well-matched with the absorption spectra (Fig. S3, ESI†) of the TiO2 and LiI/NaI treated TiO2 samples (as the absorption of light directly depends on the performance of the devices). The bandgap values of those devices obtained from the EQE plot are shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). While at the same time, the Eg of the N719 dye from the absorption edges of the EQE curves using dEQE/dλ plot was found lowest for the L2 (1.829 eV) and N3 (1.823 eV) and the corresponding figures are included in the ESI† (Fig. S11 and S12).

Finally, for comparison purpose cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) also called N3 dye has been employed as the light sensitizer to fabricate DSSCs with bare and LiI/NaI treated TiO2 photoanodes (T, L1, L2, L3, N1, N2, and N3) to observe the changes in the photovoltaic parameters. Interestingly, all the devices (L1, L2, L3, N1, N2, and N3) show an increase in VOC values compared to the pure TiO2 sample (see Table S5, ESI†). As the concentration of the alkali metal iodide increases, the electron lifetime of the DSSCs increases which leads to an increase in the overall performance efficiency of the corresponding devices. The J–V plots and IPCE spectra of all the DSSCs using N3 dye as the light sensitizer fabricated with T, L1, L2, L3, N1, N2 and, N3 photoanodes are shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†) for comparison purposes. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are tabulated in Table S5 in the ESI.† The band bending effect of the LiI/NaI treated TiO2 photoanode resulted in a decrease in the VOC values when the DSSCs are fabricated using N719 dye as the light sensitizer and increase in the VOC values when N3 dye was employed as a light sensitizer compared to the pure TiO2 photoanode. At this point, the understanding of the binding mechanism of dye molecules (N719, N3) onto the TiO2 surface, the formation of the dye-TiO2 interface and the role of dye molecule in shifting of the Fermi energy level of TiO237 will lead to better insight into the change in the photovoltaic parameters of the DSSCs.
Conclusions
In this work, an attempt was made to modify the conduction band energy level of TiO2via the surface treatment of TiO2 films with LiI/NaI solution. The XRD and Raman study of both LiI and NaI treated TiO2 films demonstrated that there is no change in the crystal structure of the TiO2 layer suggesting both LiI and NaI attachment possibly on the surface of the TiO2 and not on the crystal lattice. A flat band potential shift is noted in the surface treated samples through the Mott–Schottky study to support the shift in the conduction band energy level which is further evidenced from the increased photoluminescence intensity of the corresponding samples which resulted in the decrease in VOC of all the NaI treated TiO2 devices. The decrease in the VOC values in the case of NaI treated TiO2 films further supports the positive shift (downward shift) in the conduction band energy level of TiO2. The higher values of JSC are mainly due to the increase in the surface area resulted from the LiI/NaI surface treatment which favors more dye accommodation on the TiO2 surface. A similar behaviour of all the fabricated DSSCs is confirmed by the Bode-phase plot under illumination which indicated that the devices are not experiencing any energy barrier. The champion device treated with 0.5 mmol% NaI gives a way to think about the enhancement of the current density and the overall performance of the device by a simple surface modification which is our main motto of the research. As the device performance depends on the fabrication process, manual error in this study cannot be omitted. Even though all the characterization studies support the enhancement in the JSC values and overall performances of the NaI or LiI surface treated TiO2 photoanode in the DSSCs, a further optimization in the amount of alkali metal iodide will lead to a better insight into the device behaviour. Moreover, it is noteworthy at this point that the increase in the VOC was observed when N3 dye was employed to fabricate the DSSCs by following the same experimental conditions. The increased values of the photovoltaic parameters such as VOC and JSC resulted in the increased power conversion efficiency (nearly twice) of the devices fabricated with LiI/NaI treated TiO2 photoanodes compared to pure TiO2 photoanodes.
