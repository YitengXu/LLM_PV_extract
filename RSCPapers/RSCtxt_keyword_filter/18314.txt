It was found that TiC12 played an outstanding role in improvement of open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) for the OSCs. The effects of TiC12 on the absorption, exciton dissociation, charge extraction, bimolecular recombination and morphology of the active layer are analyzed in detail. The synergetic improvement of Jsc, Voc and FF parameters is realized to generate an advanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.25% in the optimized PM6:TiC12:Y6 (0.9:0.1:1.2) ternary device. Furthermore, the Voc is increased in proportion to the added amount of TiC12 in the ternary devices due to reduced disorder and nonradiative energy loss, although the guest donor TiC12 exhibited a higher HOMO level than PM6. This study provides an effective and innovative approach to elevate Voc and thus PCE for ternary OSCs by introducing a guest small molecule donor with a higher HOMO level and better miscibility with the acceptor.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) as a promising candidate for next generation photovoltaic technology have attracted great attention due to their advantages of semi-transparency, flexibility, light weight and low-cost for large-area manufacture via the roll-to-roll solution process.1–3 Different strategies have been applied to further improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs toward practical applications. Designing ternary active layers comprising either two donors with one acceptor (D1:D2:A system) or one donor with two acceptors (D:A1:A2 system) has become a promising approach to boost the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single-junction OSCs.4–6 In general, the third component in the ternary strategy mainly performs three functions to improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.7–12 Firstly, complemented by the absorption spectra of the other two components in active layers, it can enhance the photon harvesting ability of active layers. Secondly, it can facilitate charge separation and transfer by its bridging effect to reduce the energy loss for the sake of high open circuit voltage (Voc); finally, it can optimize the morphology of active layers to achieve appropriate phase separation, which can form an efficient charge transfer and transport pathway to improve the short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of the resulting OSCs. In the past decades, great progress has been achieved in ternary OSCs using fullerene or non-fullerene as the acceptor. The PCEs have exceeded 12% and 17% for fullerene-based OSCs13 and non-fullerene ternary OSCs,14–20 respectively.
Since Zou et al. firstly reported a low-bandgap non-fullerene acceptor of Y6 and its binary OSCs by blending with the donor polymer PM6, which exhibited a high PCE of 15.7% and a moderate Voc of 0.83 V,21 researchers have shown great interest in ternary OSCs by adding a third component into the PM6:Y6 system to further improve the PCE. The state-of-the-art progress in ternary OSCs is displayed in Fig. 1 and detailed data are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). It is found that the PCE is boosted to 17.52% in the ternary OSCs reported recently.14 The most common ternary OSCs are constructed with a D:A1:A2 system, in which the second acceptor of A2 is another non-fullerene or fullerene derivative acting as the guest acceptor. These guest acceptors have the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level and a bandgap higher than that of the host acceptor Y6, such as C8-DTC,14 IT-4F,15 TP3T-4F,22 O-IDTBR23 and IDIC.24 As a result, the resulting ternary OSCs with PM6:Y6:guest non-fullerene25,26 and PM6:Y6:guest fullerene systems25,26 can further exhibit increased Voc, Jsc and FF values simultaneously.

As the Voc is believed to be determined by the energy offset between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the polymer donor and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor, a lower HOMO energy level of the polymer donor with a larger energy offset should lead to a higher Voc value. However, it is hard to find a suitable guest donor with a lower HOMO energy level than PM6 to raise the Voc value in D1:D2:A ternary OSCs as the HOMO of PM6 is rather close to that of Y6 (ca. 0.1 eV). Hence, ternary OSCs based on the PM6:guest donor:Y6 system usually exhibited a reduced Voc value although an increased PCE of 16.55% has been obtained in a report.27 Recently, an interesting result was obtained for ternary OSCs based on the PM6:guest donor:Y6 system while using DRTB-T-C4 as the guest donor. Enhanced PCE and Jsc values were found with a slightly increased Voc value. It was suggested that a slight increase of Voc is attributed to the fact that the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of DRTB-T-C4 just lie in the middle of those of PM6 and Y6.16 However, it is difficult to find a guest donor with energy levels lying between those of PM6 and Y6 to realize high-efficiency ternary OSCs.
In this study, we introduced TiC12 as a guest donor to construct ternary OSCs with the PM6:TiC12:Y6 system, where TiC12 containing a symmetric thieno[3,2-c]isochromene unit was made according to our previous study.28 Compared to the host donor PM6, the guest donor TiC12 has higher HOMO and LUMO energy levels. Based on the previous observation, TiC12 may serve as a hole trap and result in a lower Voc for the resulting ternary OSCs. However, it is not the case in this study. Reduced disorder and reduced nonradiative energy losses with an additional solar energy absorption are observed in the PM6:TiC12:Y6 ternary system. As a result, enhanced Voc and Jsc values in the PM6:TiC12:Y6 ternary OSCs were observed. Furthermore, TiC12 has good miscibility and compatibility with Y6, which results in an optimized morphology to further improve photovoltaic properties. Therefore, the PM6:TiC12:Y6 (0.9:0.1:1.2, w/w/w) ternary OSCs with the D1:D2:A system achieved a record PCE of 17.25% in comparison to the PM6:Y6 (1:1.2, w/w) binary OSCs (PCE = 15.84%). This PCE is one of the highest values reported for PM6:guest donor:Y6 ternary OSCs. More interestingly, all these ternary devices demonstrate a monotonously increased Voc value with an addition of TiC12 into the PM6:Y6 system when the ratio of TiC12 is increased from 10 to 80 wt%. The Voc is synchronously lifted from 0.836 to 0.853 V while the PCE reaches the maximum. The results prove that the photovoltaic performance of ternary OSCs can be properly advanced by incorporating a small molecule guest donor with a high HOMO level into binary OSCs.
2. Results and discussion
A series of binary and ternary OSCs with a device structure shown in Fig. 2f were fabricated, in which Y6 is employed as the acceptor, and PM6 and TiC12 are used as the host and guest donors, respectively. The chemical structures of PM6, TiC12 and Y6 are shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the PM6, TiC12 and Y6 neat films, as well as their blend films. A slightly blue-shifted absorption profile by 20 nm is observed for TiC12 compared to PM6 in the neat films. Compared with the binary PM6:Y6 blend film, the ternary PM6:TiC12:Y6 blend film with 10 wt% (relative to the total amount of donors) of TiC12 exhibits a slightly decreased absorption coefficient in the low-energy range of 700–900 nm, but a significantly enhanced absorption coefficient in the high-energy range of 500–650 nm, and the corresponding maximum molar absorption coefficients (ε) of the PM6:Y6, TiC12:Y6, and PM6:TiC12:Y6 blend films are 6.14 × 104, 4.91 × 104, and 6.90 × 104 cm−1, respectively. Here, the enhanced absorption of the ternary blend PM6:TiC12:Y6 is favorable for increasing Jsc and EQE for the resulting OSCs.

The LUMO and the HOMO energy levels of PM6, TiC12 and Y6 were estimated by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method (Fig. 2d), and the corresponding CV diagrams are shown in Fig. 2e. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are calculated to be −5.45/−3.26 eV for TiC12, −5.51/−3.61 eV for PM6, and −5.68/−4.04 eV for Y6 from the measured onset oxidation and reduction potentials. The higher HOMO and LUMO energy levels of TiC12 compared to PM6 indicate that the combined donor mixture may increase the HOMO–HOMO and LUMO–LUMO offsets between the donor and acceptor, which can help to increase the driving force and promote exciton dissociation and charge separation in ternary OSCs.29–31 Compared to the strong photoluminescence from the neat PM6 and TiC12, efficient photoluminescence quenching (Fig. S1a†) can be observed in the PM6:TiC12 blend, suggesting that there is efficient charge transfer between TiC12 and PM6. Furthermore, almost complete photoluminescence quenching (Fig. S1b†) was observed in the resulting ternary blend PM6:TiC12:Y6, indicating that there is efficient exciton dissociation and charge generation process, and as a result, an enhancement of photocurrent can be obtained.
To explore the influence of the guest donor of TiC12 on photovoltaic properties, the PM6:Y6 binary and PM6:TiC12:Y6 ternary OSCs were made using a conventional configuration of ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO (amino N-oxide perylene diimide)/Al (Fig. 2f). The overall donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratios are 1:1.2 (w/w) in active layers. The PM6:TiC12 weight ratios are varied from 100:0, 95:5, 90:10, 85:15, 70:30, 50:50, 20:80 to 0:100. Fig. 3a and S2a† shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of these binary and ternary OSCs. And Table 1 summarizes their photovoltaic data from the optimized devices. The optimized weight ratio of PM6:TiC12:Y6 is 0.9:0.1:1.2. It is found that the PM6:Y6 binary OSCs show a PCE of 15.84%, which is 4.7 times higher than that of the TiC12:Y6 binary OSCs. When TiC12 is added with a 10% weight ratio relative to the total donor weight, the resulting PM6:TiC12:Y6 ternary OSCs exhibit the highest PCE of 17.25% with an advanced Voc of 0.853 V, Jsc of 26.80 mA cm−2 and FF of 75.4%. The ternary OSCs record a higher PCE than both the PM6:Y6 and TiC12:Y6 binary OSCs. Here, the PCE of 17.25% is the highest value among all reported PM6:guest donor:Y6 ternary OSCs. More interestingly, these ternary OSCs exhibit a monotonous increase in Voc from 0.836 to 0.905 V with the increase of weight ratio of TiC12 from 0.1 to 0.8, which are higher than the Voc from both binary OSCs. This phenomenon is rarely observed in ternary OSCs and the possible reasons will be discussed later.

The J–V characteristics for the optimal PM6:Y6, TiC12:Y6, and PM6:TiC12:Y6 based OSCs in the dark are shown in Fig. 3c. A low reverse bias current (leakage currents) was observed in these optimal OSCs. The current rectification ratio is defined as the ratio of the current at 2 V to the current at −1 V based on the dark J–V curves.32,33 The leakage current in OSCs is undesirable current that is injected from the electrodes prior to voltage turn-on that results in lower FF and Jsc values. A large rectification ratio and low dark current at reverse bias are observed in the optimal PM6:TiC12:Y6 ternary devices, indicating that the photoactive layer with the addition of a small amount of TiC12 results in fewer defects and thus drastically reduces the shunt resistance effects that often dominate the electrical characteristics of OSCs under reverse bias. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves (Fig. 3b and S2b†) show that all the Y6-based binary and ternary devices have a similar wide spectral response (300–925 nm). However, there is a significantly enhanced EQE response for the 0.9:0.1:1.2 ternary devices spanning almost the whole response region compared to the PM6:Y6 or TiC12:Y6 based binary cells. While the TiC12 content continues to increase, the EQE responses decrease. EQE values over 80% were observed ranging from 470 nm to 800 nm with a maximum of 90.2% at 540 nm in the 0.9:0.1:1.2 ternary devices. The calculated Jsc value is 26.23 mA cm−2 based on the EQE, which is very close to the value obtained from J–V measurements (see Table S1†).
 Fig. 3d shows the photocurrent density versus effective voltage (Jph–Veff) curves of the PSCs at different TiC12 concentrations. The actual photocurrent density (Jph), effective voltage (Veff) and saturation current density (Jsat) are defined by the formulae given below.34 
Jph = JL − JD
(1) 
Veff = V0 − Va
(2) 
Jsat = qLGmax
(3)where JL and JD are the photocurrent densities and dark current densities, respectively, in eqn (1), V0 is the voltage at which the photocurrent is zero and Va is the applied voltage in eqn (2), q is the elementary charge, L is the distance between the anode and cathode, and Gmax is the maximum exciton generation rate in eqn (3).35 It is found that the Jsat value is only limited by the Gmax value, which is only governed by the number of absorbed photons.36–38 At a Veff value of about 1.0 V, the maximum dissociation of photogenerated excitons occurs. These photo-generated excitons can be extracted by the individual electrodes and yield photo-current at a high electric field.
Along with the increase of the Veff value, Jph exhibits a better linear relationship and gets into the saturation state at Veff from 1.0 V to 2.0 V in the ternary OSC, which means a better charge extraction efficiency that explains its higher FF and Jsc values.39 In addition, the Va required for the devices PM6:Y6 and PM6:TiC12:Y6 to reach Jsat is significantly smaller than that of the device TiC12:Y6, indicating the presence of severe excitons or charge recombination in the device TiC12:Y6. Besides, under the short-circuit conditions, charge dissociation efficiency can be estimated by Jph/Jsat. The calculated values are 97.5%, 98.8%, and 44.9%, respectively, for the optimal devices of PM6:Y6, PM6:TiC12:Y6, and TiC12:Y6, which implied that TiC12 promoted the ability of charge dissociation in active layers.
Under the open-circuit conditions, all photogenerated charge carriers should recombine in the photoactive layers. The dependence of Voc and Jsc at various incident light intensities offers deeper insight into the influence of TiC12 on the charge carrier recombination process in the binary system and ternary system studied in this paper. Fig. 3f shows the Voc values dependent on incident light intensity (Plight). The charge carrier recombination mechanism is defined by the following equation:40 
Voc ∝ nkTln(Plight)/q
(4)where k is Boltzmann's constant. It is considered that bimolecular recombination is the dominant mechanism at a slope of unity 1(kT/q). While the slope significantly deviates by unity 1(kT/q), the non-geminate recombination, i.e. trap-assisted monomolecular recombination, is the dominant mechanism.41 In this case, the PM6:TiC12:Y6 (0.9:0.1:1.2) ternary OSCs show a slope of 1.04(kT/q). In contrast, the PM6:Y6 and TiC12:Y6 binary OSCs exhibit an increased slope of 1.10(kT/q) and 1.21(kT/q), respectively. This implies that the PM6:TiC12:Y6 (0.9:0.1:1.2) ternary OSCs exhibit negligible monomolecular recombination compared to these binary OSCs. This is perfectly consistent with the enhanced Jsc and FF values obtained from the ternary OSCs.
 Fig. 3e shows Jsc values as a function of incident light intensity. Under the short-circuit conditions, the photogenerated charge carriers can be efficiently transported to the individual electrodes. This charge carrier recombination can be assessed by the following equation Jsc ∝ Plightα, where α is an exponential factor. When the α value is close to 1, it means there is negligible bimolecular recombination in the photo-active layer. The extracted α values are 0.987, 0.986, and 0.965 for the PM6:TiC12:Y6 (0.9:0.1:1.2) ternary, the PM6:Y6 binary, and TiC12:Y6 binary OSCs, respectively. This indicates that the bimolecular recombination process is negligible and the photogenerated charge carriers are efficiently transported and collected by the individual electrodes for the ternary OSCs.
The ternary devices demonstrate an enhanced Voc value as compared to the two binary devices,42 which is uncommon and worthy of further investigation. The tendency of Voc to be dependent on the third component in the ternary devices can be explained by quasi-Fermi level splitting, resulting from the photo-induced charges filling a joint density of states (DOS). Due to the ambipolar transport of Y6, here all blends demonstrate a balanced hole and electron mobility value. To characterize the broadening extent of the DOS (σ), we evaluated the transport in the LUMO by temperature-dependent electron-only measurement with space-charge-limited current (SCLC) analysis. The traps and field variations could influence the measurement; here the Murgatroyd–Gill analytical model in combination with the Gaussian disorder model is used to accurately characterize the disorder value.43 Compared to the binary device PM6:Y6 (σ = 65 meV, Fig. 4a), a reduced disorder value (σ = 50 meV) can be achieved in the binary device TiC12:Y6 (Fig. 4b). These results suggest that the small molecule TiC12 demonstrates better miscibility with Y6 compared to PM6 and results in better electron transport. Moreover, compared to the binary PM6:Y6 devices, the ternary devices with a TiC12 ratio of 10% (Fig. 4c) and 80% (Fig. S4†) also demonstrate a smaller disorder value (63 meV and 60 meV, respectively). This is also consistent with the tendency of Voc variation along with the addition of TiC12. The shape of the function describing the DOS can be distinguished by the density dependence of the Fermi level, which is located below the disorder induced effective LUMO energy. This also means that a smaller disorder value (narrow DOS) results in a higher electron quasi Fermi level (EF,el) and a larger electron and hole quasi Fermi level offset (EF,el − EF,hole) (as illustrated in Fig. 4d), which defines the Voc value (Voc = EF,el − EF,hole).44 The reduced disorder obtained in the ternary devices can explain the enhanced Voc in the ternary devices.

Here, EF,el and EF,hole are the quasi-Fermi energy of electrons and holes respectively, and ELUMO and EHOMO are the LUMO energy of the acceptor and HOMO energy of the donor respectively. 
Photovoltaic optical energy bandgaps (Egopt) can be obtained directly from the derivative of the edge of the EQE spectra.45 The ternary device (0.9:0.1:1.2) has a very low ΔEloss of 0.55 eV as deduced from (Eg − qVoc), a bit smaller than that from the PM6:Y6 device (0.58 eV). The value of ΔEloss can be divided into three components [Eloss = Egap − qVoc = (Egap − qVSQoc) + (qVSQoc − qVradoc) + (qVradoc − qVoc)], as summarized in Table 2.46 The qVSQoc is the maximum voltage based on the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit, where it is assumed there is no absorption below the optical gap of the solar cell. The first term of (Egap − qVSQoc) is unavoidable and comes from the radiative recombination originating from the absorption above the bandgap. The second term (qVSQoc − qVradoc) is an additional radiative recombination and comes from the absorption below the bandgap. The third term (qVradoc − qVoc) comes from the nonradiative loss. For organic photovoltaics, the voltage loss from the nonradiative channel contributes a lot to the total voltage loss. The enhanced Voc in ternary devices suggests that the nonradiative loss is suppressed.47 The nonradiative loss can be studied by the electroluminescence external quantum (EL-EQE) yield, and an enhanced radiative quantum efficiency of the solar cell (higher EL-EQE value) corresponds to a reduced nonradiative loss.48 Compared to the binary PM6:Y6 and ternary device (with TiC12 ratio of 10%), the ternary device (with TiC12 ratio of 80%) demonstrates an enhanced quantum yield (Fig. S4†).

Specifically, compared to the ternary device (with 10% TiC12), according to eqn (5), the calculated nonradiative loss for the ternary device (with 80% TiC12) is ∼0.05 V lower, well consistent with the difference of their Voc. Moreover, compared to the binary device PM6:Y6, the ternary device (with 10% TiC12) also demonstrates a smaller enhancement in the quantum yield value. These results are also consistent with the disorder analysis, suggesting that the higher Voc value in the ternary device after the addition of the third component TiC12 results from the suppressed nonradiative recombination loss.
The mobility of the optimal blend films was measured by the SCLC method in the electron-only and hole-only devices, which consist of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al, respectively. Fig. S3† shows J1/2–V plots of the electron-only and the hole-only devices under the optimal conditions and their carrier mobilities are listed in Table S2.† The ternary blend with 10.0 wt% TiC12 exhibits the highest hole mobility of 1.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a more matched electron mobility of 2.76 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, contributing to the best FF value of 75.4%. To understand the influence of composition on the morphology of the blends, the crystalline properties of binary and ternary films were further characterized by grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  2D GIWAXS patterns and profiles of active layers based on (a) PM6:TiC12:Y6 = 1:0:1.2, (b) PM6:TiC12:Y6 = 0.9:0.1:1.2, (c) PM6:TiC12:Y6 = 0.2:0.8:1.2 and (d) PM6:TiC12:Y6 = 0:1:1.2 prepared under the optimal conditions; (e) in-plane and (f) the out-of-plane line-cut profiles of GIWAXS patterns. 
The PM6:Y6 film exhibits a strong (100) peak along the in-plane (IP) direction and another (010) peak along the out of plane (OOP) direction, demonstrating a dominant face-on orientation. For the TiC12:Y6 film, an intense π–π stacking peak is observed in the IP direction together with (100) and (200) laminar stacking peaks in the OOP direction, indicating an edge-on predominant orientation. After incorporating 10.0 wt% TiC12 into the PM6:Y6 system, the ternary film exhibits an evidently enhanced π–π stacking peak compared to the binary one, indicating a more ordered molecular stacking in the OOP direction. Moreover, in the OOP direction, the crystal coherent lengths (CCL) of the (010) stacking peak for binary and ternary films are 21.6 nm and 23.0 nm, respectively, indicating more compact stacking in the ternary film. It is noticed that the ordered molecular packing is hindered and the charge transport is impeded in the ternary film with further increase of the amount of TiC12 from 10.0 wt% to 80.0 wt%. As a conclusion, incorporating a small amount of TiC12 will facilitate crystallization and the desired face-on orientation in the ternary film, thus guaranteeing efficient charge transport along the vertical direction.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to reveal the surface and bulk morphologies of the BHJ films (Fig. 6). The PM6:Y6 blend shows a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness (RMS = 4.62 nm) with large-scale fibrillar structures originating from crystallite and/or aggregation. The PM6:TiC12:Y6 blend with 10.0 wt% TiC12 shows a smooth surface (RMS = 1.49 nm) with a more slender fibrillar structure. Furthermore, the components are well blended in the ternary film with no large aggregates observed. Given the GIWAXS results, the introduction of TiC12 could enhance the crystallization while retaining the fine phase separation and optimizing the surface morphology, which is beneficial for efficient charge transport. In the ternary blend with 80.0 wt% TiC12, the roughness of the film increased and the surface became more disordered. These results suggest that the addition of TiC12 can effectively modify the morphologies of the ternary blends. A certain amount of TiC12 in the ternary blend would generate fibrillar structures in the entire blend that can serve as electron transport channels to promote charge transport and collection in the ternary blend without disrupting the domain size, which is one of the critical origins for the improved Jsc and FF.

3. Conclusion
In summary, the photovoltaic performance of PM6:Y6 binary OSCs was improved by incorporating a small molecule donor TiC12 as the third component. The optimized PM6:TiC12:Y6 (0.9:0.1:1.2) ternary OSCs exhibited an outstanding PCE of 17.25% with an increased Voc of 0.853 V, Jsc of 26.80 mA cm−2, and FF of 75.4%. Unlike most other reported ternary OSCs with a D1:D2:A system, the ternary OSCs in this work exhibit a simultaneous enhancement of Voc, Jsc and FF parameters by introducing TiC12. It is noteworthy that although the guest donor TiC12 has a higher HOMO level compared to the host donor, it does not serve as a hole trap, instead, it can efficiently transfer charge to the host donor, which has a lower bandgap. By characterizing the density of states (DOS) and the nonradiative loss of the optimized binary and ternary OSCs, the enhanced Voc of the ternary OSCs can be attributed to the reduced disorder value and the suppressed nonradiative loss as compared to the binary OSCs. These results demonstrate that it is possible to enhance the Voc of ternary OSCs by addition of a guest donor as the third component with a higher HOMO level compared to the host donor, and such a strategy can be used to inspire new design of ternary OSCs for higher photovoltaic performance.
