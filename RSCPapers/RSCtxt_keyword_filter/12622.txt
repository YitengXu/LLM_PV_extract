    , Accepted 18th May 2015First published on 19th May 2015AbstractIn this study, molecular doping with polymer dots was designed to unravel its effect on the photoconductivity in organic solar cells. The photocurrent in organic solar cells exhibited a considerable increase under optimal doping concentration, leading to an ultimate enhancement of power conversion efficiency from 2.30% to 3.64%. This can be attributed primarily to the improvement of the initial boost in charge carriers due to the background carriers induced by the polymer dots and increased tail absorption by the active layer. Based on single carrier device and impedance measurements, polymer dopant can efficiently decrease charge recombination and improve charge carriers mobilities. The obtained achievements pave an approach of molecular doping in affecting the operation of organic solar cells.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted an increasing attention due to their merits, such as efficient solution-processing, capability for large areas, and the possibility of flexible devices, compared to inorganic solar cells.1–6 Although the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs, as far as we know, has reached over 10%, it is still lower to meet commercial and industry application.7–9 The bottleneck of the photons absorption range as well as the poor efficiency of exciton separation and charge transportation in organic material generates a relatively low photocurrent, leading to the restriction in the improvement of PCE. Therefore, some intensive research efforts have been carried out to achieve higher PCE such as synthesizing new polymers to better match the solar spectrum, designing cascade and tandem structure, and using different additives and electrode interfacial engineering.10–18 Among such investigations, the use of additives has received more attention due to its great effect. The incorporation of additive may improve the morphology of active layer and increase photogenerated carriers, which can also enhance exciton dissociation and charge carriers transfer within the thin bulk hererojunction (BHJ) film.19–22 Different approaches were adopted to enhance the light absorption with cautions to optimize cell absorption without increasing the thickness of active layer, so as to avoid the increase in charge recombination.23–25 The optimized use of additives resulted in remarkable increases in photoconductivity, carrier mobility and incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE).26,27 In particular, quantum dots (QDs) material due to its quantum effect and unique optical properties, which possesses potential to improve performance of OSCs in theory, has become one of the most common additives. The incorporation of quantum dots, such as CdS, PbS and CdSe, into an active layer for improving the performance of PSCs has been reported in the last decade.28–30 Recently, polymer dots have attracted extensive interest in optoelectronic devices and biological monitoring.31–35 Compared to inorganic additives, polymer dots are easy to dissolve in organic solvent and possess better compatibility with polymer donor and acceptor materials.
In this study, we prepared poly [(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-co-(1,4-benzo-1-thiadiazole)] (PF-10BT) dots (Pdots) and doped them into the active layer to improve the performance of inverted organic solar cells. The cells were employed as a blend of poly[(4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl) dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d] silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-4,7-diyl] (PSBTBT) and fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methylester (PC60BM) doping with various concentrations of Pdots as active layer. The photovoltaic performance of all finished cells is presented. We demonstrated that the PCEs of the PSBTBT: PC60BM solar cells increased from 2.30% to 3.64% mainly due to improving photocurrent.
2. Experimental
2.1 Material preparation
PF-10BT (average MW 15000–200000, polydispersity 3.0), was purchased from ADS Dyes, Inc. (Quebec, Canada). The functional copolymer poly (styrene-co-maleic anhydride) (PSMA, average Mw = ∼1700, styrene content 68%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). First, PF-10BT and PSMA were respectively dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to obtain stock solutions at the concentrations of 5.0 mg mL−1 and 2.0 mg mL−1. Second, PF-10BT solution (2 mL) and PSMA solution (1 mL) were mixed to obtain a homogeneous solution. Then, the solution (3 mL) was injected quickly into deionized water (10 mL) under sonication and the mixture was sequentially sonicated for 3–5 min. Finally, the THF in the mixture was removed by nitrogen (N2) flowing under a hotplate. The resulting Pdots solution was concentrated by continuous heating, followed by filtration through a 0.22 μm filter to remove larger particles. The concentration of finally prepared Pdots solution was 3.6 mg mL−1. The molecular structure of PSBTBT, PC60BM, and PF-10BT are shown in Fig. 1(a).

2.2 Device fabrication and characterization
Devices were fabricated with the structure of ITO (150 nm)/nano-crystal titanium dioxide (25 nm)/PSBTBT:PC60BM: Pdots (100 nm)/MoO3 (4 nm)/Ag(100 nm). The schematic structure and energy level are shown in Fig. 1(b). The glass substrates coated with ITO were first precleaned with acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and deionized water, and subsequently dried using a nitrogen gun. Anatase TiO2 layer was spin-cast at 3000 rotations per minute (rpm) onto an ITO substrate in air then thermally annealed at 450 °C for 2 h in the muffle furnace, and allowed to cool naturally. TiO2 layer acts as an electron-transport layer and it blocks the hole at the same time. For the active layer, the 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) solution composed of PSBTBT (15 mg mL−1), PC60BM (15 mg mL−1) and Pdots were spin-coated (1000 rpm for 18 s) on the top of the TiO2 layer to form a photosensitive layer in air. Active layer films of cells were made with different amounts of Pdots. The doping weight ratios (wt) of Pdots and PSBTBT:PC60BM were 0, 0.12 wt%, 0.24 wt%, 0.36 wt% and 0.48 wt%. The cells with various doping concentrations are named as Device A, Device B, Device C, Device D, and Device E, respectively. All the films were subsequently annealed at 110 °C for 20 min inside a nitrogen-filled glove box. Finally, the device was finished by the thermal evaporation of MoO3 and Ag electrode. MoO3, with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of −9.7 eV, acts as an hole-transport layer, which facilitates hole collection at the photoactive layer interface.36–38 The active area of the device is approximately 6.4 mm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of devices were measured under AM 1.5G irradiation with the intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (about one sun) in air without encapsulation by a programmable Keithley 2400 source meter. Crowntech QTest Station 1000 AD was used in IPCE measurement. The absorption and reflectance spectra were obtained using an ultraviolet/visible spectrometer (UV 1700, Shimadzu).
3. Result and discussion
In bulk-heterojunction solar cells, the surface morphology of active layer is very important for their photovoltaic performance.39Fig. 2 shows the surface morphology of active layers without and with 0.24 wt% Pdots obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Their surfaces are considerably smooth. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of two active layers is 1.03 and 0.74 nm. For doped active layer, the film surface exhibits a relatively smooth and featureless structure, which is similar to a previously reported investigation.40 AFM results reveal that introducing Pdots in PCDTBT:PC70BM blend leads to an obvious morphological variation. Pdots can interpenetrate into networks of donor and acceptor materials due to its small size. Pdots doping in active layer can increase donor/acceptor interfaces and produce connected pathways of each material type to facilitate charge extraction.

Fig. 3(a) indicates the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of inverted cells. The contrast device without Pdots demonstrates a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 9.50 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.63 V, a fill factor (FF) of 38.48%, leading to a PCE of 2.30%. When Pdots were doped into active layer, the performance of the cells improved remarkably. The PCE of devices made with an optimal doping of 0.24 wt% Pdots is 3.64% with a Jsc of 12.85 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.65 V and FF of 43.72%. Jsc and FF were both increased, which directly leads to an enhancement of PCE, resulting in 58.2% higher than control device. Moreover, the cells doped with 0.12 wt%, 0.36 wt% and 0.48 wt% Pdots were studied, and they also demonstrated relatively higher PCEs than control device, exhibiting PCEs of 3.33%, 2.98%, and 2.85%. The corresponding Jsc of doped cells are 11.85 mA cm−2, 10.46 mA cm−2 and 10.34 mA cm−2, respectively. We found that Jsc and FF both increased for the doped devices irrespective of doping amounts while maintaining the Voc at the same level. As is well known, Voc is mainly determined by the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of acceptor.41–43 With the increase of doping concentration, Jsc and PCE of doped devices obviously exhibit a different trend. They increased first and then decreased. The detailed parameters of device performance are listed in Table 1, and the values are typical average of 50 devices. In the absence of illumination, the dark J–V curves of all five devices are shown in Fig. 3(b). As expected, all the doped devices show a small leakage current at negative voltages. Besides, doped cells exhibited a higher current density in the space charge limited current dominated regime, suggesting an improvement of charge transport and a decrease of series or contact resistance. The dark J–V characteristics are in accordance with the increase of FF. With an apparent increase in Jsc, the FF of cell with optimized doping value exhibited an enhancement of 13.62% compared to the control device (from 38.48% to 43.72%), insinuating that the charge transfer properties are ameliorated. The possible operation mechanism of Pdots additive is that the presence of a third material in active film provides an interface for charge transfer and enables the formation of percolation pathways for electron transport, thus reducing the effects of space charge formation, which is beneficial for mitigating the charge recombination; however, excess doping will lead to conductivity degradation and worse device efficiency.

Fig. 4 depicts the corresponding IPCE spectra of all solar cells. For the doping devices, IPCE exhibits significant increase covering a broad wavelength range from 400 to 800 nm compared to the control device, corresponding to the J–V characteristics presented in Fig. 3, and this gives the direct evidence for the enhanced Jsc. To better illustrate the Jsc enhancement, we also obtained UV-vis absorption and reflectance spectra of PSBTBT:PC60BM blended film with and without Pdots. The absorption and reflectance spectra are shown in Fig. 5. After Pdots were doped, the blended film shows a greater optical absorption, covering the wavelength range from 400 to 850 nm (Fig. 5(a)). The active layer film indicates a higher reflectance in the region of 600–800 nm (Fig. 5(b)), which is consistent with the lower absorption in Fig. 5(a). It can be seen from Fig. 5(c) that the absorption spectra of Pdots locates in the visible-light region, which contributes to the increased light-harvesting of active layer. Moreover, doping Pdots could play a role of scattering center and more light was trapped through multiple and high-angle scattering. On the basis of the IPCE and UV-vis absorption results, it is clear that Pdots doping greatly enhances the light trapping of active layer. The increased absorption is in good agreement with the enhancement of IPCE spectra. Thus, the introduction of Pdots into active film offers the possibility of increasing optical absorption and correspondingly improves photo-induced carriers.

To investigate the effect of Pdots, we fabricated two types of single carrier devices. The electron-only device configuration is ITO/TiO2/PSBTBT:PCBM:Pdots/BCP/Ag, where the BCP acts as a hole blocking layer.44 The hole-only device configuration is ITO/MoO3/active layer/ MoO3/Ag, where the MoO3 acts as electron blocking layer and hole transport layer. The J–V characteristics of these two types of devices in dark are given in Fig. 6, and charge carrier mobilities were calculated using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model, including field dependence.45 At a typical applied voltage of 1.0 V, corresponding to an electric field of 105 V cm−1 across the bulk of a 100 nm device, hole mobility increased from 0.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, and apparent electron mobility increased from 0.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 1.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. It can be seen that hole mobilities of doped devices were all enhanced compared to control devices. Fig. 6(b) shows the same change trend for electron mobilities, which is consistent with Fig. 6(a). Furthermore, active layer doping possessed an advantage to improve charge carrier transport and reduced charge recombination, which decreased the space charge buildup that affected the internal field in the case of undoped device, leading to an increase of FF. This proved that doping Pdots into active layer contributed to the improvement of electron and hole transport properties.

One limitation of high-performance OSCs is the low charge carrier mobilities in the devices, which hinder the further improvement of the cell efficiency. A reasonable approach to overcome this drawback is to introduce a third material to form ternary OSCs, which have a cascade band structure and are favorable for prohibiting carrier recombination in the devices. In our study, the LUMO and HOMO levels of PF-10BT lie in between that of PSBTBT and PCBM, which leads to the decrease in the injection barrier, making it less sensitive to the selected contact. This type of cascade band structure is critical for exciton dissociation and carrier recombination in OSCs. To deeply understand the kinetics and energetic processes governing the device performance, we carried out the impedance spectroscopy of all cells in the frequency range from 20 Hz to 1 MHz, which is shown in Fig. 7.46–48 The data are satisfactorily described by the equivalent circuit model containing two RC components in parallel. The results give a series resistance (Rs) of 280.01 Ω for the PSBTBT:PC60BM control device, and a reduced Rs of 192.47 Ω, 185.04 Ω, 217.29 Ω, and 267.88 Ω after adding Pdots in various concentrations. The decline of equivalent resistance means that the incorporation of Pdots could effectively improve the contact between active layer and electrodes, thus decreasing the resistance of solar cells and contributing to FF enhancement. It is generally accepted that doping of conducting polymers leads to the chosen contact. As a result, the bias is mostly applied on the active layer rather than on the resistance across the contacts.49–51 Decrease in the Rs undoubtedly benefits to decrease current losses across the materials in contact.

4. Conclusion
In summary, the role of PF-10BT Pdots in inverted solar cells was investigated. The achieved performances indicate that not only Jsc is apparently improved but also FF is slightly enhanced. The mechanism of Jsc enhancement was studied via single carrier test and impedance spectroscopy. We may draw a conclusion that incorporating Pdots into the active layer possesses the capacity of enhancing charge transport property. Upon the introduction of additive, both the hole and electron mobilities increase and a more balanced charge transport in the cells is achieved. As result, Jsc and FF are increased from 9.50 mA cm−2 to 12.85 mA cm−2 and 38.48% to 43.72%, respectively, leading to a high PCE of 3.64% for optimized devices doped with 0.24 wt% Pdots.
