In this account, an approach to solar fuels is described based on Dye Sensitized Photoelectrosynthesis Cells (DSPEC) that mimic the configuration used in Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSC), but with the goal of producing oxygen and a high energy solar fuel in the separate compartments of a photoelectrochemical cell rather than a photopotential and photocurrent.
1 Introduction
A key challenge for the 21st century lies in the design and implementation of technologies for a new energy future. Hydrocarbons now account for 85–90% of the world's energy supply and, although new hydrocarbon sources continue to be found and exploited, production costs are rising and the supply is not limitless. Continued use of hydrocarbons, their combustion products, and their impact on the environment – through ice cap melting and sea level rise as temperatures increase – also pose an enormous economic risk. These factors highlight the value of a shift to renewable energy with the ultimate source being the sun. The sun provides ∼10000 times our current energy use daily but with a low energy density. Using it on the massive scales required to power the world's increasingly urban economies will require vast collection areas. In the US alone, a 10% solar efficient device would require a collection area of ∼1.6 × 1011 sq meters to meet current demand.
In addition, because it is intermittent, solar energy also requires energy storage on vast scales to provide power at night. A number of storage schemes have been proposed, or are in use,1 but the only practical approach at the required scale is “Artificial Photosynthesis” with “solar fuels” as the product. Solar fuels are high energy molecules with energy stored in chemical bonds. Target reactions are water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen and light-driven reduction of CO2 to CO or other reduced forms of carbon (eqn (1) and (2)). An ultimate target is liquid hydrocarbons that provide the basis for much of our existing energy infrastructure. 2H2O → 2H2 + O2 (ΔGo = +4.92 eV)(1) CO2 + 2H2O → CH4 + 2O2 (ΔGo = +10.3 eV)(2)
Solar fuel half reactions like water oxidation (2H2O → 4H+ + 4e− + O2), or CO2 reduction2 to methane (CO2 + 8H+ + 8e− → CH4 + 2H2O),2 are chemically challenging because they require the addition or loss of multiple electrons and multiple protons to small molecules. Natural photosynthesis serves as a role model in its use of sunlight to reduce CO2 to carbohydrates (eqn (3)). In doing this, it converts ∼1011 tons of CO2 annually into biomass, but with typical solar efficiencies of 1% or less. Photosynthesis may be a role model but far higher efficiencies are required in large scale, practical solar energy application.
Plant photosynthesis takes place in the thyalkoid membranes of chloroplasts found in the cell walls of green plants. The photosynthetic apparatus consists of a complex, integrated array of functional elements (photosystem I, photosystem II, Calvin cycle) and has remained unchanged for ∼2.4 B years. Developing Artificial Photosynthesis in a useful way requires a tighter timetable and, a far simpler, more straightforward approach. As described below, the availability of wires, membranes, and semiconductors and utilization of a “Dye Sensitized Photoelectrosynthesis Cell” (DSPEC) approach offers great simplifications by using components not available to the natural system. 6H2O + 6CO2 → C6H12O6 + 6O2(3)
1.1 Approaches to solar fuels. A primer
As described by Bolton, there are two primary approaches to making solar fuels, solar thermal and solar photonic.3 In solar thermal, the thermal energy from the sun is concentrated by using a parabolic trough or field of heliostats (e.g. power tower). The thermal energy is transferred to a heat transfer fluid that, in turn, transfers its heat to a second medium (water for the Rankin cycle, a gas for the Brayton cycle) in a heat exchanger for electricity production with turbines. Thermal-to-electrical conversion efficiences can exceed 50% depending on the cycle used and the operating temperature. In another approach, concentrated solar power (CSP) is coupled to a thermochemical cycle in a high-temperature chemical reactor typically equipped with catalysts. Several thermochemical cycles have been explored, each with its own efficiency, materials, process conditions, and temperature limitations.4
In solar photonic methods, photons are absorbed by a semiconductor or light absorber (dye or chromophore) to create electron–hole pairs. These pairs are then transferred through free energy gradients or internal electric fields to redox catalysts where multi-electron, multi-proton chemical transformations occur. Natural photosynthesis is an example. In photosynthesis, water oxidation occurs at photosystem II (PSII). Here, a chlorophyll-based antenna collects sunlight and directs it to a Reaction Center where excited state electron transfer from a terminal chlorophyll light absorber (P680) results in hole transfer to a nearby mangenese oxo cubane cluster (OEC complex) that catalyzes water oxidation to oxygen. Complementary reductive equivalents are transported by molecular membrane diffusion to photosystem I (PSI). At PSI a second antenna-driven reaction drives NADPH production which is used to convert CO2 to carbohydrates in the Calvin cycle.
The water splitting reaction in eqn (1) can be separated into half reactions for water oxidation (2H2O → O2 + 4H+ + 4e−) and proton reduction (2H+ + 2e− → H2). In a photoelectrochemical cell, water oxidation occurs at an anode and water or CO2 reduction at a cathode with one or both driven by light. Solar photonic approaches include coupling a photovoltaic device to an electrolyzer (PV-electrolyzer) and direct photoelectrolysis. The latter occurs in photoelectrochemical cells (PEC) by direct bandgap excitation of a semiconductor (SC) or at semiconductor nanoparticles. In the PV-electrolyzer approach light is absorbed by a stand-alone PV device with electrical connections to the electrodes of the electrolyzer. The overall efficiency is the product of efficiencies for the PV device and the electrolyzer. The PV-electrolyzer is a proven technology with known, long-term device efficiencies.
In the semiconductor nanoparticle approach, the nanoparticles are dispersed in aqueous solutions, typically with surfaces functionalized with a deposited catalyst. Direct bandgap excitation creates an electron–hole pair which is separated by local electric field gradients. Following diffusion to a surface, the separated electron–hole pairs are trapped by surface states or catalysts where the separate half reactions occur. A serious limitation to this approach is that oxygen and hydrogen are produced simultaneously and can recombine at the Pt catalyst sites which are typically used for hydrogen generation.
Efficiencies achieved by this approach have typically been <1%, limited by chemical and electron–hole recombination. A significant advance was made by Domen and coworkers who integrated Pt or Rh catalysts with a nanoscale coating of a Cr2O3 co-catalyst.5 This core–shell strategy selectively allowed protons to diffuse to the interior catalyst surface while avoiding O2 diffusion. Efficiences for water splitting of >5% were obtained. Tandem dual bandgap semiconducting nanoparticle strategies have been described by Kudo and coworkers.6
Laboratory scale PECs have been demonstrated with solar efficiencies of up to 18%7 although fewer than 10 PECs have been reported with efficiencies of >1% after 40 years of research. In all but one, a tandem approach was used to build up sufficient potential to meet the thermodynamic requirements of the component half reactions and overcome catalyst overpotential and ohmic losses. A serious issue has been limited device lifetimes relative to PV-electrolyzers.4
PECs can be classified as wired and wireless. In wired cells, wires are used to transmit current between electrodes and can be arranged in several different designs. For example, in single light absorber devices either a photoanode or photocathode are connected in a circuit with a catalytic electrode for the second half reaction. In tandem cells, a photoanode and photocathode are wired in a stacked configuration. In a hybrid configuration a p–n junction PV device is connected in series with either a photoanode (e.g. Grätzel) or photocathode (e.g. Turner)7 with a catalytic electrode connected for the other half reaction.
An example of the wireless approach has been reported by Nocera and coworkers. They used triple-junction amorphous Si cells coated with electrodeposited catalysts for water reduction (NiMoZn) and water oxidation (cobalt oxide).8 This configuration is similar to one used earlier by Turner and co-workers but with Pt catalysts in a wired cell.9 In both cases, the output of three Si cells are connected in series and current matched to provide voltages in excess of 2.0 V. Licht et al. has also reported a wireless dual bandgap tandem PV device,10 and Lewis and co-workers, at the DOE-sponsored JCAP Solar Hub, are developing a wireless approach in which at least one of the photoelectrodes incorporates semiconductor nanowires functionalized with catalysts.11
1.2 Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC)
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) consist of a wide band gap TiO2 semiconductor deposited on a transparent conducting substrate, an anchored molecular sensitizer or dye, and a redox electrolyte. In a DSSC, light is absorbed by the dye attached to the surface of a mesoporous, large band gap semiconductor. Structures of common dyes are shown in Table 1. Solar conversion to electricity is initiated by photoinjection of an electron from the excited dye into the conduction band of the semiconductor. The electrons move through the semiconductor to an optically transparent collector electrode, typically tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) or fluorine-doped tin oxide, and then to an external circuit to a separate cathode. A redox mediator added to the external medium ensures that the oxidized form of the dye is continuously regenerated and that the process is cyclic.

Dye sensitization of electron injection at n-type semiconductors was first demonstrated in the 1960's.12 High efficiencies were obtained by using carboxylic acid or phosphoric acid groups for linking to the surface.13 The use of dispersed particles allowed the use of large surface areas for dye/semiconductor interfaces14 and, subsequently, photoelectrodes.15,16 A breakthrough, allowing for high efficiency DSSCs, came in 1991 when O'Regan and Grätzel described, for the first time, a mesoporous TiO2 photoelectrode derivatized by a monolayer of a sensitizer.17 As noted above, use of a nanocrystalline TiO2 layer can magnify surface areas by a factor of 1000 or more compared to compact analogs.18 Low conductivity, the absence of a built-in electrical field, and the three-dimensional architecture make mesoporous TiO2 films distinct from bulk TiO2.15 TiO2 is advantageous for its low cost, earth abundance, and non-toxicity making it the preferred choice for photoelectrodes in dye-derivatized solar cell devices. TiO2 DSSCs hold the world record for solar power conversion efficiency. Over 12.3% has been achieved with laboratory-scale devices as reported recently by Grätzel, et al. in a mesoscopic solar cell configuration utilizing a Co(bipyridyl)33+/2+-based redox electrolyte and custom synthesized donor–π–bridge-acceptor zinc porphyrin dye as the sensitizer.19
1.3 Dye sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cells (DSPEC)
A cartoon illustrating a photoanode for water oxidation in a dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cell (DSPEC) is shown in Fig. 1. This PEC design mimics dye sensitized solar cells in its use of molecular light absorbers15 but with the goal of producing oxygen and a high energy solar fuel at physically separated electrodes rather than a photopotential and photocurrent. In a DSPEC, absorption of sunlight by a light absorber (dye or chromophore) on the surface of a high band gap metal oxide semiconductor triggers a series of molecular and interfacial electron transfer events that drive solar fuel half reactions in the separate compartments of the PEC. The first report of a DSPEC for producing hydrogen from iso-propanol appeared in 1999.20
 Fig. 1  DSPEC photoanode design for water oxidation, with proton reduction to hydrogen occurring at a separate cathode. In an operating cell, a membrane would be used to allow proton transfer between compartments while separating the evolved gases. 
As shown in Fig. 1, light absorption occurs at a chromophore that, when bound to a catalyst, gives rise to the chromophore-catalyst assembly. As in a DSSC, the resulting molecular excited state undergoes injection into the conduction band of the semiconductor, typically TiO2. Instead of relying on surface semiconductor reactions for water oxidation, injection is followed by oxidation of a chemically linked, external catalyst that is activated by intra-assembly electron transfer.
After the initial injection, electrons move through the mesoscopic, nanostructured, 1–10 μm thick metal oxide film, to an underlying collector electrode that, as noted above, is typically optically transparent ITO or FTO. From the collector electrode, electrons are transferred to the cathode where catalyzed reduction occurs. After four oxidative equivalents are accumulated at the photoanode, oxygen is released and the catalyst (a molecule, molecular assembly, or cluster) is recycled.

Fig. 1 illustrates a nano-structured film derivatized with a molecular assembly that is a known electrocatalyst for water oxidation.21 Because of their aqueous stability, phosphonate groups (–P(O)(OH)2) are used to link the assembly to the oxide surface. These links become prone to solvolysis at higher pHs and stabilizing these surfaces is an active area of current research.
Molecules do most of the work in the DSPEC design, justifying the slogan “Let the Molecules Do the Work”. Molecules absorb light, transfer electrons, and provide the sites for catalysis. This is in contrast to direct band gap excitation of semiconductors where the semiconductor absorbs the light, separates photo-produced holes and electrons, and is the chemically active substrate for catalysis. The DSPEC approach takes advantage of the extensive knowledge base on molecular excited states and molecular catalysts and how to modify properties by using chemical synthesis to make systematic changes. By use of a “modular approach” the multiple components required can be investigated separately, modified by chemical synthesis, and assembled in integrated device architectures.22–24
The DSPEC design is generic and can be extended to photo-reduction with photocathode designs being explored for CO2 and water reduction. In this application, p-type semiconductors such as NiO are used and advantage is taken of the ability of molecular excited states to act as electron transfer acceptors as well as donors.

Fig. 2 illustrates a tandem cell configuration. The right hand electrode is a photocathode where chromophore excitation on the semiconductor surface is followed by hole injection into the valence band of NiO or another p-type semiconductor. Hole transfer to the semiconductor occurs by electron transfer from its valence band to the excited state, with the excited state acting as an electron acceptor. In the chromophore-catalyst assembly shown, intra-molecular electron transfer from the reduced chromophore to an external catalyst begins the process of electron transfer activation for water or CO2 reduction.
 Fig. 2  Tandem DSPEC configuration for water reduction to methane illustrating at the photoanode in Fig. 1: (1) sequential photon absorption, (2) electron injection, (3) electron transport, (4) sequential hole transfer for catalyst activation, (5) water oxidation, (6) CO2 reduction. 
The tandem cell configuration in Fig. 2 couples a photoanode for water oxidation with a photocathode for CO2 reduction. In this configuration the light absorption properties of the chromophores at the photoanode and photocathode need to be balanced so that they split the solar spectrum to drive the two component half reactions. Two photons are utilized which decreases efficiency. However, if properly designed, the tandem approach extends the range of solar insolation into lower energy regions of the spectrum, into the near IR, and can be used to generate strongly oxidizing and reducing redox equivalents speeding up the rates of the solar fuel half reactions.
A beginning has been made on the design, synthesis, and characterization of DSPEC-based photoanodes for water oxidation and for the oxidation of organics.20,24,25 For example, Mallouk and coworkers have described a DSPEC design for water splitting based on a nano-particle IrO2 water oxidation catalyst.26 Although less well developed, photocathodes for CO2 and water reduction are also under investigation as are tandem cells capable of producing +1.5 V oxidative equivalents at the anode for oxidation and −1.3 V reductive equivalents at the photocathode.
1.4 Challenges
Letting the “molecules do the work” has appeal as a strategy. However, as summarized in Fig. 3, it also comes with significant challenges arising from the multiple demands of light-driven reactions. The challenges are illustrated using the chromophore-catalyst assembly from Fig. 1 as the example.16
 Fig. 3  Molecular chromophore-catalyst assembly for water oxidation in a DSPEC illustrating challenges arising from: (a) the semiconductor: conduction band potential for water/CO2 reduction; collection dynamics, (b) light absorption: near UV to 900 nm; high injection efficiency; weak or non-light absorbing catalyst, (c) molecular catalysis: catalysis rate ≫ back electron transfer rate; 13 million turnovers per year, (d) chromophore-catalyst: light absorption; surface stability; electron injection-intra-assembly electron transfer dynamics (e) device evaluation: DSSC; DSPEC, I–V characteristics; product analysis; scale up, (f) electron transfer dynamics: high injection efficiencies; rapid intramolecular electron transfer; slow back electron transfer and (g) surface binding, stability: stable over wide pH range; 13 million turnovers per year. 
In this approach challenges arise from:
- The intrinsic and interfacial properties of the semiconductor.
- The chemical link to the surface which must provide long term stability and an electronic connection for electron transfer to occur.
- Light absorption with high absorptivity throughout the visible, into the near IR for high solar efficiencies. A variety of light absorbers based on Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes, porphyrins, and organic light absorbers are currently under investigation.
- Intramolecular and interfacial electron transfer dynamics dictate cell performance. The dynamic properties of DSPECs are being explored by transient laser spectroscopies and photocurrent measurements.
- Interfacial catalysis of water oxidation and CO2/water reduction leading to indefinitely stable, rapid catalysts.
- Synthesis of chromophore-catalyst assemblies based on pre-formed molecular complexes, peptides, polymers and direct interfacial synthesis.
- Device evaluation by application of transient spectroscopies and photocurrent measurements.
Although DSPECs are criticized as relying on molecular components, which may have limited lifetimes and stabilities, the long term operating lifetimes achieved by commercial DSSCs is worth noting. Also, a great strength of the molecular approach and surface binding is the ease of fabrication. Preparation of surfaces modified by molecular assemblies like the one shown in Fig. 3 is accomplished by a simple soaking step with the surface exposed to dilute solutions of the assembly. Even with decomposition and loss from the surface, a next generation of surface-bound assemblies is available after a simple soaking cycle on demand.
The DSPEC component that is of particular interest for this account is the semiconductor and its properties – band gap, band energies, interfacial properties, and dynamics. This is the theme for the remainder of the account.
2 Semiconductor applications in DSPEC/DSSC devices
The key properties of semiconductor can be understood by examining their electronic structures. This is typically discussed in terms of electronic energy bands. Those of interest are the highest occupied band (valence band) and the lowest empty band (conduction band) which are separated by an energy gap. Filling of bands is determined by the Fermi level. Doping the semiconductor with foreign atoms or vacancies changes the distribution of electrons and band occupancies. For n-type semiconductors, the Fermi level lies just below the conduction band. For a p-type it lies just above the valence band. Transport of charge requires that electrons partially occupy filled orbitals, so n-type materials conduct by electron transport in the conduction band and p-type by hole transport in the valence band.
When two different semiconductors, or a semiconductor and electrolyte solution, come into contact their different chemical potentials drive the movement of charges, electrons and electrolyte, across the interface until equilibrium is reached. This creates excess charge regions and interfacial electric fields. These fundamental concepts play a critical role in explaining the absorption of light quanta and the generation and transport of photo-excited charges. For example, to capture solar energy and produce hydrogen by water splitting, a semiconductor needs an appropriate bandgap (1.6–2.2 eV) to absorb visible light, and create photo-excited charge carriers with sufficient energy to cleave water at acceptable rates. To produce hydrogen and oxygen from water, the band-edge positions of the conduction and valence bands must straddle the water half reaction potentials27 and excess potential is needed to overcome the kinetic barriers associated with driving the half reactions. Good transport characteristics and avoidance of traps are also essential for separating holes and electrons, ensuring they travel away from each other to catalyst sites.
In the direct bandgap approach to solar fuels, semiconductors are expected to “do it all” from light absorption to charge separation, transport, and even catalysis, all without degradation or decomposition. Demands are high and, thus far, attempts to meet them by use of mamoth trial-and-error searches6 have been ineffective in identifying single semiconductors for photoelectrochemical applications. Nevertheless, semiconductors are key in both DSSC and DSPEC applications and are an essential element in most devices for harvesting electrical or chemical energy from sunlight.
DSSCs and DSPECs differ from conventional, all-semiconductor devices, by separating the function of light absorption from charge carrier transport. Light absorption is performed by an attached light absorber (organic dye, metal complex, or even quantum dot) and the semiconductor bandgap becomes a secondary consideration. Dye sensitized devices15,28,29 use a solid, wide-bandgap semiconductor with a conduction band edge lower than the potential of the photoexcited state of the dye. In single, one photon-PEC cells, the conduction band edge must be higher than the potential for hydrogen production or CO2 reduction. Many metal oxide semiconductors with wide bandgaps fill this requirement with good photo-decomposition stability. Single molecule dyes typically have low light absorption cross-sections requiring high surface areas for anchoring multiple dye molecules. As noted above, this can be achieved by using nanoporous structures, thereby increasing the effective oxide surface areas over 1000-fold for flat, compact films. The nano-structures are deposited onto a conductive, transparent substrate, typically indium tin oxide (ITO) or fluoride doped SnO2 collector electrodes and connected with the counter electrode.
The high surface areas of the nanoporous materials provide enhanced light absorption and an extensive semiconductor–electrolyte interface for largescale collection and reaction of photogenerated electrons and holes. However, the disordered nanoscale morphology of dye sensitized devices present some adverse features for overall cell performance. In nanoporous TiO2, the high dielectric constant and small size of the nanocrystals results in photogenerated charge carriers that are effectively screened from the electric fields of the electrolyte and collector electrode and electron transport is dominated by diffusion.30–32 In addition, the thick percolating network of TiO2 nanoparticles greatly increases the opportunity for injected electrons to recombine with the oxidized molecule or assembly on the electrode surface. For DSSCs a third limitation is that the network of channels surrounding the nanoparticles is tightly constructed and convoluted across the active area, which limit dye regeneration of the oxidized dye by limiting the movement of electrolyte ions. Grätzel has noted15 that for DSSCs the use of thinner mesoscopic oxide films would decrease the negative impacts resulting in reduced dark current losses and higher open circuit voltages (Voc), but at the expense of decreased light absorption.
In order to be useful in DSPEC applications, a nanostructured semiconductor must have: (i) an appropriate band gap to obtain high transparency in the visible region of the spectrum; (ii) a large internal surface area; (iii) long term stability under irradiation in appropriate chemical environments. In evaluating new semiconductor materials, key factors are non-interfering light absorption, high surface loadings, and efficient electron injection and collection. To facilitate electron injection at a photoanode, a large density of unpopulated conduction band states is required at potentials more positive than the potential for oxidation of the dye excited state, Eo'(dye+/*). For photocathode applications, populated valence band states are required that are more negative than the dye*/− potential. Electron collection efficiencies depend on the competition between electron diffusion rates to the underlying collector electrode and the rate of recombination/interception of the injected electron with the oxidized assembly on the surface.33,34
In TiO2, intra-particle electron transfer is slow, governed by trap-limited diffusion and inter-particle transfer which occurs through a percolation network of nanoparticles.35,36 Drift transport is inhibited by ions in the electrolyte that screen macroscopic electric fields.37 Nonetheless, charge collection efficiencies in DSSCs can be high because of inhibition to back electron transfer to the external redox mediator, e.g., I3−.37,38 Electron diffusion lengths in these devices are long, up to several tens of micrometers at low light intensities,39–41 even with low electron diffusion coefficients. Electron transfer kinetics are complicated by a number of effects. For a detailed discussion, readers are referred to the literature.42–45
Despite the success of TiO2 as a photoanode in DSSCs, there are good reasons to explore other semiconductor oxides for H2O splitting or CO2 reduction. One is energetics. As shown by the initial results of Honda and Fujushima,46 efficient H2 production requires application of an applied bias to match the conduction band potential to the hydrogen evolution potential. Here we give a short summary of recent progress on other nanostructured oxide materials as photoelectrodes in dye sensitized photoelectrochemical applications.
2.1 Non-TiO2 n-type photoanode materials

2.1.1 ZnO. 
ZnO has a long history as a photoanode candidate for DSSCs.47–50 In band gap (3.2 eV) and band edge positions it is are comparable to anatase TiO2,51 but it has a higher electronic mobility, which benefits electron transport. It also exhibits decreased recombination.50 In contrast to TiO2, there is no need for a high temperature annealing step and ZnO has been produced in an abundance of nanostructured morphologies: i.e., nanoparticles,52 nanosheets,53 nanobelts,54 nanowires,55 tetrapods,56etc. To date, the highest conversion efficiency obtained for a ZnO-based DSSC is 7.5%,57 considerably lower than for TiO2. A major limitation is the chemical instability of ZnO toward acids and complexing agents.32–35 However, progress has been made in stabilizing surfaces by using ZnO core/shell structures with coatings, such as SiO2,58 TiO2,59 and Al2O3.60
An additional limitation is that low electron injection efficiencies have been reported for ZnO. The dynamics of electron injection for TiO2 and ZnO are biphasic with fast (<100 fsec) and slow components (psec).61,62 Electron injection by a Ru(II) polypyridyl dye on ZnO was shown to be dominated by the slow component with the opposite for TiO2. This may be due to a higher density of conduction band states for TiO2 (ref. 63) although other explanations have been suggested.64


2.1.2 SnO2. 
SnO2 is a wide band gap (∼3.6 eV), n-type semiconductor with fast electron transport characteristics.65,66 The higher band gap lessens complications from direct band gap excitation and promotes its long term stability in chemical environments.67 The conduction band for SnO2 is more positive than anatase TiO2 by 0.3–0.5 eV.68–71 This greatly decreases DSSC open-circuit voltages with I3−/I− as the carrier couple.72,73 On the other hand, the low conduction band potential relative to TiO2 allows electron injection from less reducing excited states such as perylene dyes, making SnO2 an attractive substrate for water splitting at the photoanode in tandem DSPECs.74
Nanostructured SnO2 has been intensively investigated as a photoelectrode in DSSC applications,74,75 with power conversion efficiencies lower than for TiO2 or ZnO.76,77 The role of morphology with different nanostructured precursors has been examined.78 All SnO2 nanocrystal products belong to the same cassiterite phase (P42/mnm space group). As-synthesized nanorod-rich SnO2 electrodes have electron diffusion coefficients (5 × 10−4 cm2 s−1) ten times higher than TiO2 but with a lower Voc consistent with its relative conduction band potential.
DSSC power conversion efficiencies of 3.2% have been reached with relatively poor performance attributed to fast recombination kinetics68 and a decreased extent of adsorption by acid-based dyes.79 In a comparative study of TiO2, ZnO and SnO2 nanoparticle films derivatized with the Z907 Ru(II) dye (Table 1), it was found that electron injection into SnO2 is dominated by a slow component which extends over tens to hundreds of picoseconds compared to TiO2 where injection occurs in a few picoseconds.77 SnO2 films derivatized with the N3 dye (Table 1) have more rapid recombination rates due to lower trap state densities and larger electron diffusion coefficients.68 Surface coatings of TiO2,76,80,81 ZnO, Al2O3,82 MgO,67,76,79 and Y2O356 have been used to boost photoanode performance. The point of zero charge (PZC) for SnO2 occurs at pH ∼4 to 5.83 The surface of the oxide coating is more basic than SnO2, resulting in more favorable attachment of the carboxylic acid groups on derivatized dyes.


2.1.3 Zn2SnO4. 
As a photoelectrode, the ternary oxide, zinc stannate (Zn2SnO4), has a high electron mobility,93 chemical stability, and a wide band gap of 3.6 eV.93 It has been used as a photocatalyst for benzene decomposition in water94 and utilized as a photoanode in DSSCs with efficiencies of up to 3.8%.95 It is more stable toward acid etching than ZnO and has better performance than pure SnO2. Photoelectrochemical measurements reveal a flat band edge differing from TiO2 by ±0.2 eV depending on electrolyte.96,97 The flat band potential of nanocrystalline Zn2SnO4 has a Nernstian pH dependence similar to TiO2 and similar pH-dependent trap state densities implying that the traps are mostly surface-confined.97


2.1.4 Nb2O5. 
Nb2O5 is a high band gap, n-type semiconductor with a conduction band consisting of empty Nb5+4d orbitals.98 The conduction band potential is generally accepted to be 0.1–0.3 eV higher than TiO2.99–103 Nb2O5 has been prepared as nanoparticles,99,104–107 nanobelts,108 nanowires,109 nano-forests,110 blocking layers,111 and in TiO2–Nb2O5 bilayers112,113 in DSSCs. There are several crystalline forms – monoclinic, hexagonal, and orthorhombic. All have large unit cell dimensions making enlargement of internal surface areas difficult.102 In a study of DSSC device performance comparing TiO2, Nb2O5, ZnO, SnO2, In2O3, WO3, Ta2O5, and ZrO2, Nb2O5 had the second highest IPCE and highest open circuit potential, Voc.102 For a crisscross nanoporous Nb2O5 film, ∼4 μm prepared at elevated temperature by anodization, Ou et al. recently demonstrated efficiencies of 4.1% relative to nano-tubular TiO2 DSSCs derivatized with the N3 dye.114 The results of impedance spectroscopic measurements pointed to a large charge transport resistance and long electron lifetimes. Literature values for Eg and Ecb for Nb2O5 are ambiguous. They are typically cited without specifying crystal structure, morphology, or measurement conditions.18,101,102,105,115–119 A highly cited paper reported Eg ∼ 3.4 eV and Ecb = −0.5 V vs. NHE at pH 7. The latter value is 0.2 V more negative than TiO2 but the measurements were conducted on a sample prepared by anodic oxidation of the metal without thermal treatment.120 Another commonly cited value, for a sample that was a TT-phase hexagonal crystal, placed the conduction band potential more negative than anatase TiO2 by 0.2 eV.118,121
We recently found that for nanoporous orthorhombic films of Nb2O5, synthesized by sol gel techniques, Ecb was ∼100 meV more positive than for anatase TiO2 by spectroelectrochemical measurements.122 Conduction band edges for pulsed laser deposition (PLD)-prepared Nb2O5 films having the same crystal structure, were shown to have comparable positive shifts based on vacuum UPS measurements.122 In a recent study, a Nb2O5 photoanode derivatized by the phosphonate complex RuP in Table 1, was investigated toward H2 production with the added sacrificial reductant EDTA. Hydrogen evolution at the cathode was sustained at a relatively high efficiency under steady state illumination.25 Compared to TiO2 under the same conditions, efficiencies for hydrogen production were observed, the result of a compromise between a lower injection efficiency for Nb2O5 and slower back electron transfer, which occurs on the microsecond timescale.


2.1.5 SrTiO3. 
The ternary metal oxide SrTiO3 has a perovskite cubic structure similar to anatase TiO2 with Ti4+ ions in 6-fold octahedral coordination sites.123 Grain sizes up to 80 nm behave electrically mesoscopic as a result of a high dielectric constant (∼175 at 300 °C).124,125 SrTiO3 has a more negative flat band potential than anatase TiO2 by ∼0.2 to 0.4 eV,71,100,126 which in principle, should provide a higher Voc in DSSCs than TiO2.127 Based on the results of laser flash photolysis studies, it has been suggested that low photocurrents observed for N3-dye sensitized SrTiO3 nanofilms may be attributable to poor dye loading and not to electron injection or transport issues intrinsic to the semiconductor. The flat band edge for nanoporous SrTiO3 films varies with pH as, Efb = −0.59 to 0.04 pH (vs. Ag/AgCl).126 A detailed study of the role of solvent, electrolyte, and other additives on the performance of the N3 dye gave an open-circuit voltage of 0.6 V and short circuit current of 0.41 mA cm−2 under 100 mW cm−2 Xe lamp irradiation.128


2.1.6 WO3. 
Recent studies have explored WO3 as a photoanode in DSSCs.129 Its band gap varies from 2.6 to 3.1 eV for common crystal phases130 relative to anatase TiO2. WO3 is chemically stable, easy to synthesize131–133 and has synthetically tunable morphologies.129 The conduction band edge for WO3 is more positive than TiO2 by ∼0.4 to 0.5 eV.100,101,134 Nanoplatelets of WO3 synthesized by anodization at elevated temperatures have been investigated in DSSCs.135 A nanoparticle WO3-based DSSC was reported to have a low power conversion efficiency of 0.75% which was improved to 1.46% after treatment with TiCl4. Low efficiencies were explained by to the very acidic metal oxide surface and poor dye loading.136


2.1.7 Other photoanode materials. 
In addition to binary and ternary photoanodes additional oxides have been explored or are currently under investigation as TiO2 replacements including Ta2O5,137 CeO2,138,139 and BaSnO3.140,141 There is also an extensive literature of doped TiO2 materials. One of the most promising is tantalum (Ta) doped TiO2.142–144 In DSSCs, nanowires of this material in the rutile structure have achieved open circuit voltages of 0.87 eV close to the theoretical limit of 0.95 eV.143 The high Voc value is likely due to the higher electron concentration introduced by Ta5+ surface trap sites which increases the higher quasi-Fermi level. Ta-doped TiO2 photoanodes have achieved enhanced efficiencies of 7.40–8.18%. Ta doping provides a positive shift in the conduction band compared to anatase TiO2 due to fast electron transport, a higher concentration of carriers, and enhanced performance.
For a Nb-doped TiO2 based DSSCs,145–149 Lü et al. observed an overall efficiency of 7.8% for 5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2.146 Doping shifted the flat band edge positively relative to anatase TiO2 with an augmentation in photoanode conductivity. Initial results on TiO2-doped photoelectrodes with Sn,150,151 W,152 Cr,153 Sr, Sb,154 Zn,155 Cu,156 Ru,157 Zr,158 Ge,158 N,159,160 B,159,161 and I162 have all been reported.

2.2 p-Type photocathode materials
Compared to n-type semiconductors for photoanode applications, there is a dearth of information on p-type photocathodes in dye-sensitized photocathode applications. For a typical p-type metal oxide, the key step is light-induced hole transfer from the excited dye, which can also be described as electron transfer from the valence band of the semiconductor (eqn (4)). The energetics require that the upper edge of valence band lie above the potential for the dye*/− couple. As for photoanode materials, the photocathode should be transparent in the visible and chemically stable. A short summary of the properties and applications of common p-type materials is presented below. Readers are referred to the literature for further detials.69,163,164 (4)

2.2.1 NiO. 
The most comprehensively studied photocathode material is oxidatively doped NiO. An extensive background literature is available from earlier studies on the use of NiO films for electrochromic devices. NiO is a wide band gap semiconductor with Eg ranging from 3.6 to 4 eV and has a cubic burnsenite structure.165 Valence and conduction bands are at ∼0.54 V and −3.06 V, respectively, at pH 7 vs. NHE. In addition to band gap excitation, visible light absorption occurs in the Ni(III) doped, mixed valence material from an intervalence transfer absorption.165–167 In 1999 Lindquist and co-workers168 reported the first p-type DSSC. They combined a nanoporous NiO electrode derivatized by tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TPPC) and erythrosin B with the I3−/I− couple for photocurrent generation. Measured IPCE values were low, 0.24% and 3.44%, respectively, under AM 1.5. The low overall efficiency (<0.01%) and low Voc values were attributed to the small driving force for I− oxidation to I3− by the photo-produced hole in the NiO valence band. Recent progress has been reported with new classes of redox mediators.169–171
A growing literature exists based on porphyrin,168,172 coumarin,173,174 perylene,92 and arylamine-based dyes175,176 (note Table 1), most with IPCE values less than 10%. Donor–acceptor dyes have also been investigated with anchoring group located on the donor side. For example, Bach and co-workers successfully built perylene imide based dyes that reach the record power electricity conversion efficiency of 0.41%.177 Sun and co-workers developed a series of donor–acceptor dyes88–90 (i.e. P1, P4, P7; Table 1) including the use of triphenylamine as donor and dicyanovinylene as the acceptor. When combined with a double layer of NiO, the resulting P1 sensitized DSSC gave an efficiency of 0.15% and an IPCE of 64% under AM 1.5 irradiation. Incorporation of a Co-based hydrogen evolution catalyst in a DSPEC configuration with 400 nm excitation, gave H2 by transferring electrons from reduced dye P1− to Co(II), which initiated catalytic H2 formation.178
Hole diffusion in NiO films (10−8 to 10−7 cm2 s−1) is 2 orders of magnitude slower than electron diffusion in TiO2.179,180 This increases the possibility of hole annihilation by back electron transfer resulting in poor device performance. Rapid recombination following injection into NiO films also limits photoconversion efficiencies. With Coumarin 343 (C343) as a benchmark,163 hole injection was shown to occur in 0.2–2 ps and back electron transfer within 20 ps. Regeneration of ground state dye occurred on the microsecond timescale and was uncompetitive with ultrafast recombination.173


2.2.2 Copper-based oxides. 
Although less well studied, p-type photocathodes other than NiO have also been reported with potential for applications in DSSC/DSPEC applications including p-GaP181 and N-doped Ta2O5.182,183 Copper oxide-based materials show promise as a NiO replacement as shown by DSSC measurements. Sumikura et al. prepared CuO p-type materials and demonstrated sensitization by several dyes including N3. Low device efficiencies were observed in DSSC devices, but possible use of CuO as a photocathode was demonstrated.184 Copper(I) oxide has a narrow band gap (2.0–2.2 eV) and conduction band edge at −1.15 V vs. NHE at pH 7,185 which is suitable for hydrogen production or CO2 reduction. Grätzel et al. applied ZnO/Al2O3/TiO2 atomic layer deposition to stabilize Cu2O surfaces in water and obtained consistent H2 generation.186
The CuMO2 (M = Al, Ga) semiconductor family also shows promise as a NiO alternative. The p-type CuAlO2 with a band gap of 3.55 eV, and the N3 dye were used in a DSSC.187 CuGaO2 delafossite nanoplates, possessing a band gap of 3.60–3.80 eV and valence band edge of 0.6 V vs. NHE188 were derivatized by addition of the P1 dye and investigated in p-type DSSCs.150 The oxide is a white p-type material without competitive background light absorption. Competitive visible light absorption is a complication in the use of NiO. By employing a Co(dtb-bpy)33+/2+ (Table 1) redox carrier/electrolyte, a DSSC device achieved a Voc of 0.36 V under AM 1.5 illumination, but with saturation of the photovoltage at 0.46 V at high incident light intensities.

2.3 Tandem applications
In tandem cells, an n-type photoanode and p-type photocathode are combined, Fig. 2. The tandem configuration utilizes two photons which, as noted above, decreases efficiencies by 2, but this configuration offers other advantages that can overcome the limitations inherent in single junction solar cells.189,190 A tandem DSSC with complementary light harvesting utilizing two dyes, offers enhanced spectral coverage and a greatly increased maximum Voc with the latter the sum of the maximum values for the separate compartments.191 Tandem cells can be connected in parallel,192 face to face,193 or in series.194
The first experimentally demonstrated DSSC consisted of a N3-derivatized tandem cell consisting of a TiO2 photoanode and NiO photocathode.165 The resulting cell reached a Voc of 0.73 V and overall efficiency of 0.39%. The total Voc came from a 0.65 V contribution from the TiO2-based n-DSSC and a 0.08 V contribution from the NiO-based p-DSSC. The efficiency was increased to 0.66% with the dye NK-2684 (Table 1) by enhancing the internal surface area of the NiO film by use of the triblock copolymer template (poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-PPO-PEO, Pluronic P123)).91 Hammarström et al. improved the open circuit voltage of the tandem DSSC cell up to 0.91 V by using a cobalt metal complex redox mediator with NiO and TiO2 sensitized by PIND and N719, respectively.169 Bach and co-workers achieved efficiencies as high as 2.4% in a related DSSC tandem cell by using a sensitizer with oligothiophene–PMI dyad bridge used to reduce charge recombination.177
Photoanodes other than TiO2 can also be integrated into tandem cells. For example, a SnO2/NiO p–n junction electrode sensitized by N3 dye showed improved performance compared to a SnO2-based DSSC.195 Although progress has been made, performance in state-of-the-art tandem DSSC cells are, to date, inferior to single TiO2 n-type DSSCs. Exploitation of the tandem approach requires a major breakthrough in the development of p-type photocathodes.
3 Conclusions
Considerable progress has been made in advancing the concept of dye sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cells, but much remains to be accomplished. DSPECs provide a systematic approach to solar fuel devices based on a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) configuration by integrating wide band gap semiconductors with the light absorption, electron transfer, and catalytic properties of molecular level or cluster assemblies. The design greatly benefits from the integration of separate “modules”, designed and maximized for individual roles – light absorption, catalysis, etc.
As in DSSCs, a key element is the integration of molecular level light absorption with interfacial electron transfer to or from wide band gap oxide semiconductors. Semiconductor interfaces provide a basis for achieving light-to-electron/hole conversion on a transient basis and an interfacial support for molecular-level assemblies, which combine light absorption, electron/hole transfer, and catalysis.
Although DSSC and DSPEC applications have been dominated by n-type TiO2, other wide band gap oxides are under investigation as photoanodes which can provide more negative conduction band potentials for water and CO2 reduction. Derivatized NiO undergoes light induced hole injection with surface-bound chromophores and a basis for photocathode applications. Other materials are under active investigation both in photocathode and photoanode applications, and in combined tandem cells which combine photodriven anodes and cathodes.
