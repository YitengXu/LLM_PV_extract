1. Introduction
Two-dimensional (2D) layered materials are currently a topic of significant interest due to their extraordinary physiochemical properties.1 Their unique anisotropic structural characteristics make them potentially useful in a wide range of applications, such as optoelectronics, photonics, catalysis, piezoelectric devices, environmental pollution control, energy storage and conversion, and biomaterials.1–3 Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), previously known as anionic clays, are one family of 2D materials that have attracted significant interest in recent years. LDHs comprise of positively charged edge-shared octahedral coordinated metal hydroxide layers sandwiched by charge compensating interlayer anions with optional solvation e.g., water. The general formula of an LDH is [M1−xa+Mx′b+(OH)2]y+[Ay/cc−]y+·zH2O; y = a(1 − x) + bx − 2; Ac− is an interlayer anion; M and M′ are metal cations. Most frequently LDHs conform to the formula [M1−x2+Mx′3+(OH)2]x+[Ax/cc−]x+·zH2O (where M2+ and M′3+ are divalent and trivalent metal cations typically of Mg2+ and Al3+ respectively; Ac− are inorganic or organic anions) (Fig. 1).4–7 In a few special cases the M2+ site can be substituted by Li+ and the M3+ site can be substituted by M4+ cations.8 In this review, an LDH containing the metal components, M1/2+ and M′3/4+ are abbreviated as MM′-LDH. LDHs became the focus for both fundamental research and practical applications due to their unique structures, tunable chemical compositions, and a wide variety of material properties.6,9–13 Despite the unique intrinsic properties of LDHs, various functionalization strategies have been applied to LDHs that yield even more exciting performance opportunities. That is, functionalization can drastically improve the performance of LDHs or develop new properties for use in a wide range of applications. For instance, the fabrication of three-dimensional hierarchical nano-architecture of an NiFe-LDH remarkably facilitated its rate of electron transport and channel diffusion for catalytic water splitting.14 Hybridizing with conductive textile fibers made NiCo-LDH a promising candidate for high-performance pseudocapacitors.15 Intercalation of polysulfide developed the potential of MgAl-LDH for highly selective and efficient capture of radionuclide, e.g., uranium.3 Hybridization of LDHs with semiconductors to form heterojunction can markedly inhibit the recombination of charge carriers, and thus significantly enhance photocatalytic activity.16,17

Functionalization of LDHs is a process involving the control and manipulation of their surface zone, shape, size, and composition to activate them, or introduction of foreign species or defects on LDHs to enhance or create new functions.1,9,18–20 The modification of surface zone includes intercalation of functional species and alteration of surface functional groups. Introduction of foreign species emphasizes anchoring functional substances onto the surface of LDHs to generate LDH-based hybrids. Apart from the modification of surface zone and introduction of functional species, LDHs can also be functionalized by manipulation of layer composition including the type, ratio, and chemical valence of the metal components, by regulation of the size and morphology of LDHs, and by creation of defects resulting from surface and layered composition regulation. Herein, we summarize the common functionalization strategies that have been developed for LDHs in the following major categories: (1) intercalation,2,3 (2) surface modification,21,22 (3) hybrid assembly,23,24 (4) layer composition tuning,25,26 (5) size and morphology regulation,14,27 (6) defect introduction,26,28 among others. Each of these functionalization strategies demonstrates that with the appropriate modification LDHs can deliver novel and/or enhanced features, e.g., enhanced photoelectronic,23,29 magnetic,30 catalytic,29,31,32 and energy storage15,33,34 properties, offering unique perspectives and advantages for both fundamental and applied research.
The fundamentals why these strategies can effectively functionalize LDHs are outlined in this review article. For example, the reasons that intercalation is such a versatile and effective approach in tuning the properties of LDHs are: (1) intercalation provides the highest possible doping and/or phase change to the pristine LDHs; (2) the intercalation process, and the concomitant changes in the properties of LDHs is typically reversible; (3) intercalation is controllable; (4) changes in intercalated LDHs during material preparation can be monitored in situ and in real time; (5) intercalation can induce structural changes, such as lattice expansion or even phase changes, for improved or new physiochemical properties; (6) intercalation adds a new degree of freedom for tuning LDHs, which can be combined with other modification methods.1 The modification of surface functional groups of LDHs can be one of the most common strategies in altering the surface properties of LDHs, because the introduction of foreign functional groups renders LDHs to possess different or enhanced functions. For instance, the introduction of amine terminal groups onto MgAl-LDH makes the MgAl-LDH a potential biomaterial without causing any hemolysis,35,36 and enhances its functions in the environmental field.37 The reason that the introduction of functional materials onto LDHs can alter the properties of LDHs is ascribed to the fact that it can combine the strength of each component in the structure and functions. I n addition, the components in hybrids may even generate synergies, which will result in the enhancement of the properties.19,20,23,24,34,38 For example, in the electrochemical field, LDHs have been reported to be promising electrode materials for the next-generation supercapacitors, but the relatively low conductivity of LDHs constrains their performance.39,40 It's suggested that the electrochemical properties of LDHs can be further improved by the hybridization with conductive materials.29 This is because the conductive materials, e.g., graphene, can significantly enhance the electrical conductivity and accelerate the electron transfer, resulting in excellent charge and discharge capability.41–45 Many other reasons for the enhanced or newly created functions of LDHs produced by various functionalization strategies are summarized in Section 2.
In this review, we focus on the functionalization strategies for LDHs, and highlight the significance of functionalization in tuning the physiochemical properties of LDHs and their subsequent applications particularly in the environmental, energy, catalysis, and biomaterials sectors. We also provide some insights into the challenges and future opportunities of LDHs.
2. Strategies to functionalize LDHs
In general, functionalization of LDHs can be achieved by modifying their surface zone, assembling hybrids, and regulating layer composition, size and morphology. The modification of surface zone includes intercalation of functional species and alteration of surface functional groups. Hybrid assembly emphasizes anchoring functional substances onto the surface of LDHs to generate LDH-based hybrids. The assembly usually occurs at the interface between LDHs and the loaded functional substances. Manipulation of layer composition focuses on the regulation of type, ratio, and chemical valence of the metal components. The size and morphology section highlights the impact of size and morphology on the properties of LDHs. Apart from the above aspects, other factors such as creation of defects resulted from surface and layered composition regulation can also be utilized to functionalize LDHs.
2.1 Intercalation
The phenomenon of intercalation was first discovered ca. 600–700 AD in China.46 At that time, alkali metal ions were intercalated into natural minerals, such as kaolin, to make porcelain.47 The first intercalation phenomenon in the literature was reported by Schafhäutl in 1840, in which the authors attempted to dissolve graphite in sulphuric acid.48 The modern era of intercalation research was initiated in 1926 by Fredenhagen et al., in which the uptake of potassium vapor into graphite was reported.49 Over the subsequent decades, intercalation strategies for 2D materials have significantly advanced and various mechanisms have been clarified.18,50–63 Exploring the benefits of intercalation in 2D materials for various applications remains a very active contemporary field of research.
The intercalation of 2D LDHs is a process of inserting a foreign species between the edge-shared metal hydroxide layers of the LDHs (Fig. 2). In many instances, intercalation can lead to drastically improved performance for the LDHs. For example, incorporation of homogeneous catalysts (e.g., inorganic anions, organic acid/base, organic complexes) into LDH interlayer space offers the chance to heterogenize the homogeneous reaction process over LDH-based catalysts with enhanced lifetime and thermal stability, as well as facile separation/purification.9 Intercalation can also make LDHs more favorable for the use of energy storage and conversion. In one example, the intercalation of bistrifluoromethane sulfonamide into galleries of CoTi-LDH endowed CoTi-LDH with the ability in making up low-overpotential Li–O2 batteries with superior cycling stability.64 Herein, we summarize some common LDHs and intercalants reported in recent years, and the benefits of the intercalation in improving various performances of LDHs (Table 1). The data suggests that different combinations of LDHs and intercalants can offer different performances, and intercalation is indeed a promising means to functionalize LDHs and to expand their applications. The reasons that intercalation is such a versatile and effective approach in tuning the properties of 2D LDHs are: (1) intercalation provides the highest possible doping and/or phase change to the pristine LDHs; (2) the intercalation process, and the concomitant changes in the properties of LDHs is typically reversible; (3) intercalation is controllable; (4) changes in intercalated LDHs during material preparation can be monitored in situ and in real time; (5) intercalation can induce structural changes, such as lattice expansion or even phase changes, for improved or novel physiochemical properties; (6) intercalation adds a new degree of freedom for tuning LDHs, which can be combined with other modification methods.1

2.2 Surface modification
Modification and control of surface properties of LDHs are of crucial importance in the functionalization of LDHs. There are numerous studies focusing on the surface modification of LDHs by hybridizing functional materials onto the surface of LDHs. For example, surfactants are the most popular functional species to be anchored onto the LDH surface to functionalize an LDH.18,19 In this section, we focus on the regulation of the properties of LDHs by the introduction of various functional groups.
The modification of surface hydroxyl groups of LDHs can be one of the most common strategies in altering the surface properties of LDHs. For example, Oh et al. modified the surface hydroxyl groups of MgAl-LDH by grafting aminopropyltriethoxysilane, which introduced amine terminal groups onto the surface of MgAl-LDH without affecting the LDH layered structure (Fig. 3a).81 The amine terminal groups could be utilized as an active site for further modification to render MgAl-LDH as an effective drug-delivery carrier.81 Hu et al. found that the functionalized MgAl-LDH with amine terminal groups (functionalized through a three-step surface grafting process) possessed enhanced blood compatibility, which made it a potential biomaterial without causing any hemolysis.35,36 Besides the applications in the medical field, amine groups functionalized LDHs can also be used in the environmental field. For example, Ezeh et al. found that after amine modification, MgAl-LDH presented an enhanced physical adsorption of CO2, and with an increase of amine loading, the adsorption of CO2 was further enhanced.37 In another example, Li et al. introduced various functional groups including phenolic hydroxyl groups, alcoholic hydroxyl groups, and carboxyl groups onto the surface of ZnAl-LDH by loading fulvic acid.82 The fulvic acid anchored ZnAl-LDH showed a great ability to simultaneously remove organic dyes and heavy metal cations. In addition to the functional groups derived from organic compounds, functional groups from inorganic substances can also functionalize LDHs. For instance, Lima et al. prepared fluorinated MgAl-LDH by using NaAlF6, and found that the introduction of surface F terminal groups onto MgAl-LDH could significantly modify the physicochemical, thermal, and adsorptive properties.83

Apart from the above discussed functional groups, many other groups have been grafted onto the surface of LDHs, such as epoxide group, disulfide bonds, Br groups, and silanol groups,7,18,36 which led to remarkable improvement in a range of physical properties of the LDHs.
2.3 Hybridization
The combination of two or more distinct properties into a unique composite is an exciting direction for the fabrication of novel multifunctional materials. Construction of LDH-based hybrids, especially one with a nanostructure, by interacting LDHs with other materials (e.g., silica nanoparticles, magnetic nanoparticles, semiconductors, rare earth and noble metal elements), is an emerging active research vector which may serve various fields, such as environmental remediation, energy conversion and storage.23,24,38 The introduction of functional materials onto LDH can alter the properties of LDHs, offering various enhanced or new functions to LDHs. Hybrid assembly provides the advantages of combining the strength of each component in the structure and functions. In addition, the components in hybrids may generate synergies. The resultant hybrids may exhibit new properties depending on the interactions between the different components. Herein, we mainly highlight the construction of LDH-based hybrids by the fabrication of core–shell structure and the loading of conductive materials, semiconductors, and rare earth elements or noble metals onto LDHs to enhance or extend the functions of LDHs. Notably, some LDH-based hybrids can be grouped into different sections. These materials will be discussed only in one of the sections below.

2.3.1 Introduction of a “core” or “shell”. 
The terminology of “core–shell” was first adopted in the early 1990s when researchers attempted to synthesize concentric multilayer semiconductor nanoparticles to improve the property of semiconductor materials.86Fig. 3b shows different types of core–shell structures. The general concept of core–shell presents two materials with two functions in one structure (Fig. 3b-1). When the core is removed, hollow core–shell structural material will be created (Fig. 3b-2). And by combining the above two types of core–shell structures, the yolk or rattle core–shell architecture which has a core@void@shell configuration (Fig. 3b-3) is generated.86 Generally, core–shell nanoparticles are well-known for better stability, for being able to protect the core material from the surrounding environment, for improved physiochemical properties, for improved semi-conductive properties, for easy biofunctionalization. The shell could change the functions and properties of the original core,84 and the core could also modify the functions and properties of the original shell.87 In other words, the core/shell can exhibit new chemical or physical properties with shell/core formation. In addition, core–shell composites may have properties that are synergistic between the core and the shell and/or offer new properties depending on the interactions between the core and the shell.87,88
Thanks to the above highlighted merits, the construction of core–shell composites has become an effective avenue to functionalize LDHs. For instance, to enhance the supercapacitor behavior of NiAl-LDH, Shao et al. fabricated core–shell LDH microspheres with tunable interior architecture using SiO2 as a core.85Via the regulation of interior architecture, core–shell, hollow core–shell, and yolk core–shell types of NiAl-LDHs were produced (Fig. 3c), and variations in specific surface area and pore-size distribution were achieved. Moreover, the prepared core–shell microspheres, especially the hollow ones, exhibited excellent pseudocapacitance performance, including high specific capacitance and rate capability, high charge/discharge stability, and long-term cycling life (Fig. 3d). The improvement of the supercapacitor performance of NiAl-LDH was due to the greatly improved faradaic redox reaction and mass transfer. In another example, Han et al. used CoAl-LDH as the core to produce flexible CoAl-LDH@poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) core–shell nanoplatelets for high-performance energy storage.87 The synthesized material exhibited high specific capacitance, excellent rate capability, and long-term cycling stability, which were superior to those of the conventional supercapacitors and the CoAl-LDH without the shell of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene). The largely enhanced pseudocapacitor performance of the prepared material was related to the synergistic effect of its individual components: the LDH nanoplatelet core provided abundant energy-storage capacity, while the highly conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) shell and the porous architecture facilitated the electron/mass transport in the redox reaction. LDH-based core–shell materials have growing applications because of the multifunctionality that is achieved through the tailoring of core/shell materials. Table 2 summarizes some representative LDH-based core–shell composites in the past three years and the significance of fabrication of a core–shell structure. Clearly, novel physiochemical properties, such as medical, magnetic, catalytic, electrochemical, and electronic characteristics can be imparted to LDHs through the formation of a core–shell structure.

According to the previous studies, a number of factors are important role in deciding the physical and chemical properties of core–shell materials, such as (a) ligand effect, which involve the interactions between the core and the shell due to atomic proximity affecting the charge transfer between the components; (b) ensemble effect, which is governed by the material's adsorption on the surface due to the presence of distinct atomic groups, and (c) geometric effect, originating from the difference in reactivity of the surface atoms because of their three dimensional structural constraints (e.g., surface strain).88


2.3.2 Hybridization with conductive materials. 
LDHs are emerging as potential candidates in electrochemical, photo-electrochemical, and photochemical applications due to the facile tunability of their chemical composition, many transition metal ions across a range of oxidations states possess ionic radii that can be accommodated within the octahedral sites. Their electrochemical, photo-electrochemical and photochemical properties can be further improved by the hybridization with conductive materials.29 In the electrochemical field, for example, LDHs were reported to be promising electrode materials for the next-generation supercapacitors.39,118 However, the relatively low conductivity of LDHs constrains electron transfer, resulting in poor charge and discharge capability that adversely affects the performance of electrode materials.39,40 Hybridization LDHs with conductive materials has been demonstrated to be a feasible and effective approach to enhance the electron conductivity.119–121 For instance, Zhang et al. designed and synthesized a hybrid of CoAl-LDH and graphene, they found that the loading of conductive graphene endowed CoAl-LDH with a high specific capacitance that was much higher than the pure CoAl-LDH. In addition, the obtained hybrid showed a high cycle stability of 93.9% of the specific capacitance retained at 3 A g−1 after 2000 cycles.39 The improved electrochemical performance benefited from the anchoring electroactive graphene onto the surface of LDH. Liu et al. anchored conductive carbon nanoparticles onto the surface of NiAl-LDH, and manifested the resulting supercapacitor to exhibit excellent capacitive performance, including a high specific capacitance, good cycling capability and high energy density. The enhanced electrical conductivity that resulted from the incorporation of carbon nanoparticles contributed to the improved capacitance and rate capability.122 Yang et al. designed a graphene oxide (GO) surface-confined strategy to fabricate NiCo-LDH–graphene nanosheet composites (Fig. 4). By this strategy, ultrathin 2D nanosheets with a thickness of 1.7–1.8 nm that are duplicated from the GOs in terms of both the lateral dimensions and the shape can be prepared. The as-obtained NiCo-LDH–graphene nanosheets exhibited a superior electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction, evidenced by a small overpotential of 0.337 V (@10 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M KOH electrolyte), and a high charge storage capability of 1489 F g−1 as electrodes for supercapacitors. The authors pointed out that the relatively wide interlayer distance, ultrathin and highly tortuous structures, large specific surface area, multilevel pore structure, and high electrical conductivity benefited from graphene resulted in the high activity.

In photocatalysis, hybridization of LDHs with conductive materials brings similar benefits. The ease in electron–hole recombination for many LDH photocatalysts restrains their applications in photocatalysis. The hybridization with electron accepting species provides a powerful approach to further enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of the LDH material by the timely conduction of electrons to prolong the lifetime of electron and hole. Gunjakar et al. assembled a highly effective photocatalyst by combining ZnCr-LDH with graphene nanosheets (Fig. 5a).29 The coupling of graphene with ZnCr-LDH gave a remarkable depression of the photoluminescence signal, and an unusually high photocatalytic activity for visible light-induced O2 generation with a rate of ca. 1.20 mmol h−1 g−1, which was far superior to that of the pristine ZnCr-LDH (ca. 0.67 mmol h−1 g−1; note that pristine ZnCr-LDH is one of the most effective visible light photocatalysts for O2 production with an unusually high quantum efficiency of 61% at 410 nm wavelength). The loading of graphene gave rise to a remarkable depression of electron–hole recombination by the timely conduction of electrons. Fig. 5b-2 shows a schematic illustration of electronic coupling between ZnCr-LDH and graphene, showing how graphene takes effect.

Table 3 summarizes the LDH-based hybrids anchored with various conductive materials in recent years. LDHs containing Ni2+, Co2+/3+, Fe2+/3+, Mn2+/4+, Zn2+, Ti4+, and Al3+ are the most frequently studied in the electrochemical field, carbon-based materials and metals such as nickel are the most common conductive materials hybridized with LDH. Clearly, anchoring conductive materials with LDH is a promising avenue to functionalize LDH and expand their application as functional electronic materials.

2.3.3 Hybridization with semiconductors. 
Transition metal-containing LDHs have been reported to exhibit highly-efficient catalytic performance, of most note is their activity in water splitting, and oxidation and reduction of environmental contaminants. Although transition metal containing LDHs show high catalytic performance, hybridizing semiconductors onto LDHs can generally further enhance the catalytic activity of LDHs. Taking the application of LDHs in photocatalysis as an example, anchoring semiconductors on LDHs will commonly result in the formation of heterojunction, which can increase the separation efficiency of the excited electrons and holes to improve the photocatalytic activity by inhibiting the recombination of charge carriers (i.e., the photo-generated holes and electrons). For example, Ao et al. found that the hybrid of BiOBr and CoNi-LDH exhibited much higher adsorptive and photocatalytic degradation of organic contaminants (organic dyes and phenol) than either BiOBr or CoNi-LDH under UV-light irradiation.16 The excellent photocatalytic activity is because of the formed heterojunction between the BiOBr and the CoNi-LDH, which inhibits the recombination of charge carriers, and thus more holes or electrons can be captured to induce the photocatalytic reaction. Fig. 5b shows schematic illustrations of different types of semiconductor/LDH heterojunctions in electron–hole separation and transport and photocatalytic activity under visible or solar light irradiation.124,125 Clearly, the photo-generated electrons and holes can transfer between LDH and the hybridized semiconductors, which are significantly beneficial to the extension of the lifetime of electrons and holes, and thus increasing the photocatalytic activities.
Anchoring semiconductors onto the surface of LDHs can also improve the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical catalytic activity of the LDHs. For instance, Hu et al. hybridized MoS2 onto NiCo-LDH and demonstrated a dramatic enhancement of hydrogen evolution reaction kinetics in base media compared to either MoS2 or NiCo-LDH.159 The resultant MoS2/NiCo-LDH hybrid exhibited extremely low hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential of 78 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a low Tafel slope of 76.6 mV dec−1 in 1 M KOH solution. Benefiting from the desirable structural characteristics, the MoS2/NiCo-LDH interfaces synergistically favor the chemisorption of H (on MoS2) and OH (on LDH), and can thus effectively accelerate the water dissociation step and the overall hydrogen evolution reaction. Zhang et al. hybridized TiO2 with ZnFe-LDH, and found that TiO2/ZnFe-LDH photoanode exhibited a largely enhanced photoelectrochemical water splitting performance.160 The study revealed that the photogenerated holes of TiO2 tended to travel to ZnFe-LDH, which enhanced the bulk charge separation, and thus the surface water oxidation reaction. Table 4 summarizes the representative LDH-based hybrids anchored with various semiconducting materials, the table highlights that the anchoring of semiconductors significantly enhances the catalytic activities of LDHs.

2.3.4 Hybridization with noble metals or rare earth elements. 

Table 5 summarizes the noble metals and rare earth elements that have been anchored on LDHs and the impacts these elements have on enhancing the properties of LDHs. Noble metals such as Au, Ag, Pt, Pd, and Ru, and rare earth elements of Ce, Tb, and La are the most prevalent elements to be anchored onto LDHs. Loading noble metals and rare earth elements on LDHs can dramatically improve the photocatalytic performance with enhanced light absorption, charge transport properties, interfacial kinetics,171 and the adsorptive abilities for reactants.171,172 Noble metals and rare earth elements improve the properties of LDHs owing to one or several of the following aspects:40,126,171,172 (1) noble metals and rare earth elements are electron-abundant species which possess prominent electron donating abilities; (2) noble metals and rare earth elements have strong coordination abilities; that is, when integrated into LDH, they can serve as adsorptive sites; (3) noble metals and rare earth elements can conduct electrons promptly; (4) the loading of noble metals and rare earth elements may create lattice distortions which can be active sites; (5) photoresponsive characteristics, e.g., surface plasmon resonance, of noble metals and rare earth elements. Taking the applications of LDHs in photocatalysis as an example, LDHs have emerged as highly active photocatalysts due to their unique structure, large specific surface area and semiconductive properties. However, the slow interfacial kinetics and fast charge recombination (due to the poor charge mobility) are the major obstacles which limit the performance of LDH-based photocatalysts. Fu et al. demonstrated the incorporating terbium onto ZnCr-LDH could significantly inhibit the recombination of photo-induced charge carriers and increase the charge injection efficiency simultaneously, and thus largely enhanced the visible light photocatalytic performance for oxygen evolution (about a 2-fold increase compared with that of the pristine ZnCr-LDH).171 Tb provided a prompt conduction of the photo-induced electrons and the injection of electrons of Tb accelerated the target reactions. In another example, Mikami et al. found that anchoring gold nanoparticles on ZnAl-LDH could remarkably enhance photocatalytic degradation of phenol under solar light irradiation.126 The specific charge transfer between the gold nanoparticles and the ZnAl-LDH and the surface plasmon resonance of gold particles contributed significantly to the enhanced photocatalytic response (Fig. 5c).

2.4 Regulation of layer composition
The LDH structure type is very accommodating to changing the metal components, their molar ratios, and oxidation states. The ionic radii of the two metal cations is the principal guiding concept to assess the feasibility of a particular metal cation combination for the hydroxide layers.185 As a result the physical properties of an LDHs can be greatly controlled by this very flexible chemical composition space.186

2.4.1 Regulation of metal components. 
The flexible LDH structural platform offers an effective means to adjust the chemical, coordination, and oxidation states within an LDH. Adding and reducing metal component(s), or replacing the metal component(s) with different metal(s) regulates the properties of LDHs.26,114,187–189 For example, Parida et al. prepared MgAlFe-LDH by the incorporation of Fe3+ into MgAl-LDH framework with the aim of investigating the role of iron in photocatalytic activity for H2 generation.189 The sample with the highest concentration of iron in the LDH layer was found to be the most effective catalyst towards hydrogen evolution under visible light irradiation. Wang and coworkers also found that the incorporation of iron could enhance the electrochemical performance of LDHs for oxygen evolution reaction.114 In another example, Liu et al. demonstrated that the electrocatalytic activity of NiFe-LDHs for oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline conditions could be notably increased by aluminum substitution, because the introduction of trivalent Al ions could adjust the ratio of low-coordinated Ni and Fe atoms.26 Furthermore, the number of active sites (defects) could also be greatly increased by the partial etching of Al species in strong alkaline solution, which further increased the activity toward oxygen evolution reaction.26 However, when investigating the performance of NiAlCo-LDH in rechargeable NiZn battery, Gong and coworkers found that the existence of the element Co could slightly inhibit the performance (e.g., capacity) of NiAlCo-LDH compared to that of NiAl-LDH.25 This is probably because Co2+ can suppress the oxidation of Ni2+ to a higher oxidation state. Therefore, the addition of new metal components may also present suppression in improving performances of LDHs; in other word, the reduction of some pre-existing metal elements in certain LDHs may also improve the properties of LDHs. The above examples demonstrate that the incorporation of new metal component(s) into LDH framework and reduction of metal component(s) from LDH can alter various properties of LDHs.
By replacing the metal component(s) with different metal element(s) of LDH, the properties of LDHs can also be tuned. In one instance, Li et al. prepared NiAl, CoAl, MnAl, NiCo, NiMn, and CoMn-LDH to investigate the synergistic effect between different metal components on the electrochemical behaviors of LDHs.188 It was demonstrated that the LDHs with dual transition metals possessed lower band-gap energies and higher conductivities than mono-transition metal-based samples. The reduced band-gap energy and enhanced conductivity should be ascribed to the hybridization between 3d-orbitals of different transition metal atoms. As a result, the LDHs with dual transition metals exhibited lower charge transfer resistances and redox potentials as well as longer electron lifetime, thus they could be oxidized or reduced more easily during the redox process. According to their results, NiMn-LDH possessed the lowest charge transfer resistance and longest electron lifetime, which signified that the synergistic effect between Ni2+ and Mn4+ was the best.

Table 6 presents representative examples of altering properties of LDHs by the regulation of metal component(s). As one can observe, on one hand, the regulation of metal component(s) can significantly improve various performances of LDHs, which can be ascribed to several reasons, including endowing LDHs with the specific characteristic of a certain metal ion, modifying surface structure and crystallinity, increasing specific surface area, improving electronic structure and conductivity, adjusting band-gap, and creating defects. On the other hand, tuning the metal component(s) by introducing improper metals may also inhibit the performance of LDHs.

2.4.2 Regulation of ratio of metal components. 
The properties of LDHs can be fine-tuned by adjusting the molar ratio of the metal components. For example, Zhao et al. found that the molar ratio of Ni/Ti could significantly affect the catalytic activities of NiTi-LDH.202 The NiTi-LDH with a Ni/Ti molar ratio of 4:1 displays the highest photocatalytic activity in H2 production, in comparison with the LDH with a Ni/Ti ratio of 2:1, 3:1, and 5:1. Sumboja et al. also revealed that the molar ratio of LDHs greatly influenced their catalytic activity.205 In their study, they demonstrated that NiMn-LDH with the optimized Ni/Mn molar ratio (3:1) had good crystallinity, large interlayer spacing, and large surface area, all of which were beneficial to enhance their catalytic activity. Apart from the catalytic performances, regulation of the molar ratios of metal components of LDHs can also tune other properties. For instance, Zhang et al. found that the electrochemical performance of NiCo-LDH was closely related to the molar ratio of Ni/Co.204 As the content of nickel was increased, the sample tended to have a higher specific capacitance. Their electrochemical data demonstrated that the binary hydroxide with a Ni/Co molar ratio of 7:3 could deliver the maximum specific capacitance of 1803.6 F g−1, while the binary hydroxide with a Ni/Co molar ratio of 3:7 exhibited a high rate capability. These results indicated that increasing the amount of Ni could increase the conductivity of Ni–Co binary hydroxides. On the other hand, different Ni/Co ratios would result in different basal spacing of NiCo-LDH. The experimental results also gave a clue that the charge storage stability and rate capability of these hydroxides highly depended on the basal spacing of NiCo-LDH. A higher basal spacing corresponds to a better electrochemical performance. In another example, Kim et al. systematically investigated the effect of Mg/Al molar ratio (between 3 and 30) on the adsorption of CO2 by MgAl-LDHs.196 When the Mg/Al molar ratio was between 12 and 30, these MgAl-LDHs showed a unique two-step CO2 adsorption behavior: low CO2 loading initially followed by a gradual transition to very high CO2 loading. The CO2 adsorption capacity for the MgAl-LDH with an Mg/Al molar ratio of 20 exhibited the highest reported value. The different adsorption behaviors may be ascribed to the different pore structures, surface areas, and crystallinities resulted from the different Mg/Al molar ratios.196

Table 6 presents examples of how altering the molar ratio of metal components may alter the properties of LDHs. As shown in Table 6, by regulating the molar ratio of the metal components in LDHs, one can generally adjust the crystallinity, basal spacing, charge density, surface area, porous structure, distortion of layers, electron conductivity of layers, and/or band-gap structure of LDHs, and subsequently obtain LDHs with tunable properties.


2.4.3 Regulation of chemical valence of metal components. 
Generally, regulating chemical valence state of the metal components of LDHs can modify the electronic structure of individual components, thus changing the properties of LDHs.27,209,210,212 In a particular instance, Gou et al. reported that tuning the valence state of Co in NiCo-LDH could be an effective method to significantly improve the rate performance of NiCo-LDH, which was realized through a facile in situ chemical treatment of phosphites.209 The specific capacitance of the obtained rosette NiCo-LDH electrode was 1425 F g−1 at 20 A g−1, which was 83.9% of 1698 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. Meanwhile, a moderate cycling stability with an efficiency of 80.6% after cycling 4000 times at a current density of 10 A g−1 was obtained. Moreover, an energy density of 40.1 W h kg−1 at a power density of 801.2 W kg−1 was achieved in an assembled aqueous asymmetric supercapacitor, using NiCo-LDH as the positive electrode material and activated carbon as the negative electrode material. Their study showed that the chemical treatment evoked morphology and phase transformation and induced partial Co2+ conversion to a more conductive Co3+ state. The electrochemical performance is also highly related to the valence state of cobalt. Qian and coworkers demonstrated that tuning the valence state of a metal component of LDH could notably enhance the performance of the LDH.210 In their research, the Co2+ in NiCoFe-LDH was partially oxidized to Co3+ by H2O2, which significantly enhanced both oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction activity of NiCoFe-LDH. This phenomenon was attributed to the partial conversion of Co2+ to Co3+ state in the pre-oxidation step, which stimulated the charge transfer to the catalyst surface.

Table 6 presents typical examples of the changes the chemical valence states of the metal components of LDHs. In these examples, transition metals such as Ni, Co, and Fe are the most common metals to be regulated. The change of valence state of the metal components within LDHs is commonly a key factor to enhancing catalytic activities and electrochemical performances (e.g., supercapacitor performance) of LDHs.

2.5 Size and morphology control
Since the decrease of particle size, thickness and the diversification of morphologies of LDHs have a significant impact on their electronic, catalytic, and adsorption properties and thus potential applications,213–216 considerable efforts have been focused on tuning the particle size and thickness, as well as the morphology of LDHs in the past decade.6,213–218

2.5.1 Size refinement. 
Downsizing LDHs (i.e., lowering particle size or thickness of LDH layers) offers a significant opportunity to enhance a range of LDH properties that are attributed to factors such as more coordinatively unsaturated metal cations (i.e., defect-rich structures which serve as active centers), more available exposed active sites, larger specific surface area, and higher electronic conductivity than the bulk LDHs.27,214,215,219–222 For example, Zhao et al. found that the decrease of the size of NiTi-LDH by in situ preparing monolayer LDH nanosheets contributed greatly to the improvement of its supercapacitor performance.27 It was reported that the NiTi-LDH nanosheets exhibited a maximum specific capacitance of 2310 F g−1 (at 1.5 A g−1), which is unprecedented and 6 times higher than that of the bulk counterpart (377 F g−1). Furthermore, it could maintain a remarkable rate capability and high durability. The NiTi-LDH nanosheets with highly exposed chemically reactive sites and a large specific surface area ensured an efficient supercapacitive reaction. Zhao et al. also found that the coordinatively unsaturated metal ions in ultrathin ZnAl-LDH contributed significantly to the photocatalytic activity in CO2 reduction.215 Due to the dramatic enhancement of various properties of LDHs via decreasing size or thickness, huge innovative efforts have been devoted to advance the approaches of preparation of ultrafine or ultrathin LDHs.
The methods to prepare ultrafine or ultrathin LDHs are mainly based on two pathways, i.e., bottom-up and top-down strategies.6 The bottom-up strategy is to prepare ultrafine or ultrathin LDHs from initial metal salts, while the top-down pathway is to decrease the particle size or thickness of the pre-existing LDHs. Generally, controlling or separating the nucleation and crystallization processes of LDHs, such as using limited space under controlled reaction conditions to induce the formation of LDHs, is an effective bottom-up means to prepare ultrafine or ultrathin LDH (Fig. 6A–D).27,223 For example, Hu and O’Hare were the first to utilize a water-in-oil reverse microemulsion as a LDH synthesis microreactors providing only limited space and nutrients for the proceeding reactions to prepare ultrafine MgAl-LDH.224 By limiting the available space and nutrients the nucleation and crystallization processes could be very precisely controlled, and the prepared MgAl-LDH possessed uniform nanometer sizes typically with a diameter of 40–50 nm and a thickness of ca. 10 nm. Wang et al. also reported a method by using a continuous-flow hydrothermal reactor to prepare ultrafine CaAl-LDH and MgAl-LDH.225 In this method, the nucleation and aging time can be controlled to be very short (e.g., 4 s), which prevents the growth of the LDH nanosheets. These examples indicate that the control of nucleation and crystallization (under aging state) is highly important in bottom-up strategy to prepare ultrafine LDH. Sun and coworkers developed a unique approach to prepare LDH single-layer nanosheets by growing LDH in formamide, which serves as an effective blocking agent to selectively block the growth of the LDH in the thickness direction.217,218 Their preparing procedures are shown in Fig. 6E.

In the top-down pathway, the most prevalent and effective, but meanwhile very demanding, approach is the exfoliation of the layers into individual nanosheets. In this way, inorganic layers with a very high aspect ratio may become thoroughly separated. A summary of exfoliation methods can be found in the literature.6,226 After exfoliation, various properties of the LDHs usually exhibit a pronounced enhancement compared to those of the pristine LDHs.221,222,227 For instance, Song and Hu demonstrated that the exfoliated CoCo-LDH, NiCo-LDH, and NiFe-LDH single-layer nanosheets exhibited significantly higher oxygen evolution activity than the corresponding bulk LDH in alkaline conditions.221 The exfoliated nanosheets from NiFe-LDH and NiCo-LDH outperformed both the activity and stability of a commercial iridium dioxide catalyst. The improvement of the catalytic activity in oxygen evolution reaction is attributed to the more active sites created by exfoliation and the improved electronic conductivity. Sun et al. also confirmed that the ultrathin MgAl-LDH, CoAl-LDH, CoCo-LDH, and NiCo-LDH prepared from exfoliation could exceptionally improve the electronic and hydroxyl ion conductivities.222 They found that the above LDH single-layer nanosheets exhibited exceptionally high in-plane hydroxyl ion conductivity approaching 10−1 S cm−1 (the bulk LDHs generally up to 10−3 S cm−1), which was the highest among anion conductors and comparable to proton conductivity in commercial proton exchange membranes (e.g., Nafion®). This 2D superionic transport characteristic might have great promises in a variety of applications including alkaline fuel cells and water electrolysis.


2.5.2 Dimensional morphology regulation. 
It is known that the common LDHs synthesized by the conventional methods usually exhibit a plate-like morphology (i.e., 2D morphology). Although LDHs with a 2D morphology possess fascinating functions, tuning their dimensions may endow LDHs with more attractive characteristics. In modern research, 3D hierarchical nanostructures have drawn considerable attention due to their unique properties and potential applications.213 The fabrication of LDHs with a 3D morphology has been demonstrated to be an effective means to introduce unique performances to LDHs.228–231 Li and coworkers developed a facile, inexpensive, and self-assembling strategy to massively fabricate a 3D rosette NiCo-LDH under mild reaction conditions (55 °C) via one-step chemical co-precipitation in metal–ammine mixture solution (Fig. 7a). After systematic investigation of various reaction factors including the Ni/Co feeding ratio, reaction time, and initial pH value, the authors managed to regulate the morphologies of NiCo-LDH from nanoparticles and nanosheets to nanopetals, and eventually to rosette microspheres. The resultant 3D NiCo-LDH was demonstrated to have high electrochemical performance with an excellent capacitance value of ca. 2228 F g−1 (1 A g−1). In another instance, Li et al. prepared a rosette NiAl-LDH using a template-free and facile self-assembling hydrothermal synthesis method in the existence of poly(sodium-p-styrene-sulfonate).230 The prepared 3D rosette NiAl-LDH exhibited excellent energy storage performance, which was much higher than that of the common NiAl-LDH. Apart from rosette 3D morphology, other 3D morphologies, such as cone-shaped232 and vertically aligned nanosheets228 have also been developed, and these 3D LDHs displayed high performances in various fields. The high performances of 3D LDHs can be ascribed to, but not limited to, some of the following aspects:137,213,228,229,231 (1) 3D structures can produce a relatively high specific surface area and/or unique hierarchical porous 3D architectures; (2) the highly oriented and rigid 3D architecture can help overcome the problem of low conductivity in conventional LDHs; (3) many 3D LDHs are composed of thin LDH nanosheets; (4) 3D LDHs may have higher surface activity than common 2D LDHs.

In addition to 3D morphologies, other morphologies such as LDH nanorings,233 nanoscrolls,234 nanorods,235 and nanowires236 have been reported, offering options to modify the characteristics of LDHs. Yang and coworkers synthesized unique MgAl-LDH nanorings with an external diameter of ca. 750 nm and an internal diameter of 250 nm in an organic/water solvent system via a urea hydrolysis method by using Mg10(OH)18Cl2·5H2O nanowires as the precursor (Fig. 7b).233 The resultant unique MgAl-LDH nanorings had a higher specific surface area and larger pore volume than the plate-like LDHs. Furthermore, the MgAl-LDH nanorings presented a significantly enhanced catalytic performance in the Knoevenagel reaction between benzaldehyde and diethyl malonate compared to the plate-like LDH. Lv et al. prepared a novel 1D CoAl-LDH, i.e., nanoscrolls, by facile trinal-phase hydrothermal treatment under different pressures (generated by controlling temperature).234 Their study indicated that CoAl-LDH nanosheets formed at first, which subsequently evolved into nanoscrolls (Fig. 7c). Notably, their investigation results confirmed that the urea and pressure played key roles in the formation of the 1D CoAl-LDH nanoscrolls. Further observations by scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution TEM indicated that the nanoscrolls were derived from nanosheets through a roll-up process, rather than through the control of the crystal growth in one particular direction. Owing to the increased specific surface area and novel structure, the nanoscrolls exhibited high adsorption capacity and excellent reusability in the adsorption of organic contaminant (methyl orange) in aqueous solution. These examples demonstrated that the fabrication of LDHs with special 2D (e.g., nanorings) or 1D morphology also helps the regulation of physical properties (such as surface area and porosity) of LDHs.


2.5.3 Hollow and porous structures. 
Recently, much attention has been paid to nanostructured materials with a hierarchical architecture due to their large specific surface area, high porosity, high structural stability, as well as significantly enhanced performances, e.g., electro-chemical responses, high ionic transport, enhanced adsorption capacity and catalytic activity, in comparison with their common counterparts.237,238 LDH is one type of such widely studied nanostructured materials. Fabrication of hierarchical LDHs with a hollow or highly porous structure is currently an active approach to control the properties of LDHs. Various researchers have found that hollow or porous LDHs can be prepared by using a template,237,239–242 applying bubbles,243 or employing acid or alkali to etch LDHs.244 For example, Shao and coworkers synthesized hierarchical MgFe-LDH microspheres with a tunable interior structure via a facile and cost-effective method by using sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) as the template.237 By controlling the concentration of SDS, the structure of the products could be tailored from hierarchical rosette MgFe-LDH solid spheres to yolk–shell and then to hollow spheres with different interior space (Fig. 8a). The changes in interior space eventually contributed to the changes in specific surface area and pore-size distribution. Specifically, the maximum specific surface area of the hollow MgFe-LDH microspheres (213.6 m2 g−1) was much larger than that of the yolk–shell (124.4 m2 g−1) and solid (78.8 m2 g−1) one. In addition, the pore size analysis based on the isotherms indicated that these samples consisting of a mesoporous distribution in the range of 2–6 nm. Their subsequent application results indicated that the hollow MgFe-LDH microspheres exhibited to be most promising in electrocatalytic oxidation of ethanol in alkaline fuel cells, including high activity, enhanced long-term durability and cycling stability. The high performance of the hollow LDH is a result of significantly improved faradaic redox reaction and mass transport contributed by the high specific surface area and hollow and mesoporous structures. In another instance, Rodriguez et al. developed a bubble method to prepare porous MgAl-LDH by the intercalation and decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, in which oxygen nano-bubbles were generated and subsequently pierced holes in the galleries of LDH (Fig. 8b).243 The decomposition of the peroxide can be triggered by microwave radiation or chemically by reaction with iodide (I−) ions. The presence of hydrogen peroxide in the interlayer space and its later decomposition triggered by microwave radiation generated pores in between LDH layers, increasing the specific surface area from 9 m2 g−1 to a maximum value of 67 m2 g−1. Different from the above strategies, Abushrenta and coworkers prepared a porous LDH by applying alkali to etch the pre-synthesized CoAl-LDH which grew on Co(OH)2 plates (Fig. 8c).244 The porous structure of the CoAl-LDH significantly favored the ionic diffusion and charge transport, and provided a large contact area owing to its porous structure, leading to a high supercapacitor performance. Clearly, various approaches can be employed to prepare hollow and porous LDHs, and the fabrication of hollow and porous LDHs can usually dramatically improve various properties of LDH thanks to the unique hollow and porous structures, and high specific surface area.

2.6 Defect creation
While defects are usually highly undesirable in most materials, researchers have sought to intentionally introduce defect sites into traditional LDHs as a means of activating LDHs. For example, it was reported that defect sites (e.g., oxygen vacancies) could decrease the barrier for the adsorption of reactants, and the surface defects would lead to the formation of coordinatively unsaturated metal centers which can serve as active sites and subsequently improve electronic conductivity.245 Previous reports also showed that, in the applications of catalysis and photocatalysis, abundant atomic defects in monolayer semiconductors could notably increase the mobility of surface electrons and thus significantly enhance catalytic performance.27 The formation of defects can usually increase the density of states near the Fermi level, which serve as active centers for catalysis.246 In addition, defects can also create new active sites for the adsorption of reactants and increase light absorption through narrowing of the bandgap, synergistically enhancing photocatalytic activity. Therefore, defects can tune the adsorption ability, electronic conductivity, and light absorption performance of LDHs, and create more active sites for LDHs.
The above merits of defects markedly advance the diverse performance of LDHs. For instance, to improve the efficiency of visible-light-driven photocatalytic dinitrogen fixation, Zhao et al. designed an ultrathin CuCr-LDH with a severely distorted structure.219 The study showed that the ultrathin CuCr-LDH photocatalyst possessed a remarkable photocatalytic activity for the photoreduction of N2 to NH3 in water at 25 °C under visible-light irradiation. It was demonstrated that the CuCr-LDH nanosheets contained abundant oxygen vacancies that enhanced the adsorption and activation of N2 and H2O, endowing the LDH nanosheets with an excellent photocatalytic activity for transforming N2 to NH3. It was also revealed that the introduction of Cu2+ ions in the LDH nanosheets imparted additional structural distortions and compressive strain, leading to an increased interaction between the LDH and N2, thereby promoting NH3 evolution. In another work, they introduced abundant oxygen defects onto ZnAl-LDH nanosheets by controlling the particle size of the nanosheets, and demonstrated that the created abundant oxygen vacancies on the ultrathin ZnAl-LDH nanosheets could serve as trapping sites for efficient adsorption of CO2 and H2O molecules, promoting the photo-induced charge separation and significantly improving the catalytic activity for CO2 reduction.215 In a report by Liu and coworkers, the defect-rich ultrathin CoFe-LDH nanosheets were proved to be highly effective in overall water splitting.245 The defects played a key role in the improvement of water splitting performance. Therefore, creation of defects is a theoretically and practically viable and promising approach to functionalize LDHs.
3. Applications
LDHs have found widespread application in the past few decades. After appropriate modification or functionalization LDHs can exhibit new and/or improved function, as briefly discussed in the above section. In the following section, we will discuss a designed functionalization may be performed to achieve a specific property enhancement. For example, because of their unique physiochemical properties, functionalized LDHs are particularly suitable for environmental, energy, catalysis, and biomaterial related applications.
3.1 Environmental applications
With rapidly growing industrial development worldwide, the need for a new class of functional materials and techniques for treating various contaminants (e.g., heavy metals, radionuclides, and organic contaminants) remains a major concern to protect the environment. LDHs and particularly functionalized LDHs are emerging as promising materials for environmental remediation,9,247 especially in water systems.9,247,248 Functionalized LDHs can not only provide physical but also chemical means to remove contaminants, which makes them far superior to other common materials such as activated carbons and silicates in environmental remediation. Functionalized LDHs can be used as both an adsorbent and a catalyst, which greatly exploit the physical and chemical properties of functionalized LDHs. When functionalized LDHs are used as an adsorbent, various features of the LDH (e.g., anion exchange ion or basic sites) provide active sites for many adsorbates. The facile manipulation of the adsorption sites (e.g., layer charge density, basic strength and density) by the aforementioned strategies as well as the morphology/pore structure at micron-nano scale offer a possibility to tune the active structure and adsorption kinetics for a specific adsorption process.9 Utilizing LDHs as a catalyst, various aspects of LDHs can be regulated to achieve a high catalytic activity for the degradation of contaminants, including the flexible tunability of the metal cations in the layers, the overall morphology and pore structure, the exchangeability of the intercalated anions in the interlayer space, the accessibility of the guest functional species after hybridization (such as conductive materials, semiconductors, and noble metals or rare earth elements), and the providential defect sites.9,248 Herein, we will manly focus on the applications in the removal of heavy metal ions, radionuclide, and organic contaminants by functionalized LDHs.

3.1.1 Heavy metals removal. 
The presence of heavy metal ions (e.g., Cu2+, Co2+, Cd2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, As3+/5+, Cr3+/6+, and Hg2+) in our environment has raised worldwide health concerns. Heavy metals originate from wastewater and steams from a range of industries such as plastics, battery manufacturing, mining, paper, electroplating, fertilizer, and steel.247,249 Many heavy metal-containing complexes bioaccumulate in living organisms thus ultimately causing a serious threat to human health.247 Therefore, the removal of heavy metals from environmental medium such as water remains a key subject of research. Previous studies suggested that functionalized LDHs exhibit very favorable adsorption to heavy metals as measured by high adsorption capacity and selectivity,2,66,76,247,250–252 which resulted in effective removal of toxic metals to meet increasingly strict environmental regulations. For example, Ma and coworkers found that the intercalation of MoS42− into MgAl-LDH interlayer space could not only endow MgAl-LDH with the ability to adsorb various heavy metal ions (Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, and Ag+) rapidly and effectively, but also offer high selectivity for some of these heavy metals.2,66 The intercalation of MoS42− produces a 5–8 folds increase of the heavy metal cations capture capacity of the MgAl-LDH compared to that of the non-functionalized MgAl-LDH. Recently, Asiabi and coworkers have indicated that the intercalation of functional species into the interlayer space of LDH could endow LDH with a highly selectivity and efficient removal of heavy metals, and the properties (e.g., functional groups) of the intercalants played a key role in the adsorption process.76,251
Apart from the functionalized LDHs produced by intercalation, various other types of functionalized LDHs were also showed to be highly effective in heavy metal removal, such as the LDH hybridized with carbon materials,253–255 3D LDHs,213,255 core–shell LDHs,256 and ultrathin LDHs.257 The main factors contributing to the favorable adsorption of heavy metals by the functionalized LDHs include high specific surface area and porosity, unique nanostructure, and the specific functions of the guest species hybridized with LDH.2,66,213,250,254,255


3.1.2 Radionuclide capture. 
Nuclear energy generation is considered to be an important component of an economical and sustainable energy generation strategy. However, the development of improved nuclear energy generation approaches involves developing effective management protocols for the radioactive waste at each part nuclear fuel cycle.258 Radioactive nuclides are some of the dangerous contaminants in the environment because of their long half-life, high radioactivity, and biological toxicity.258 In recent years, functionalized LDHs have been demonstrated to be potential candidates to remove or immobilize radioactive contaminants (e.g., U(VI), 129I, 99Tc, and 79Se) from environmental media.3,66,259–267
Functionalized LDHs can remove or immobilize radioactive contaminants mainly through surface adsorption and/or interlayer anion exchange.267 Surface adsorption involves the attachment of a nuclide onto the surfaces of the LDHs or onto the sites of the guest species used to functionalize LDHs, forming a stable molecular or atomic film on the top of the LDH material or an aggregation on the guest species zones. In the surface adsorption process, the adsorption of radionuclide can be induced by the nature of the LDH or the guest species on LDH. The interlayer anion-exchange process involves the exchange of interlayer anions with the targeted nuclide anions and is mainly influenced by the nature of the charge balancing anions in the interlayer space, the layer charge density, and the interlayer distance.3,267 Ma and coworkers demonstrated that the intercalation of polysulfide into the galleries of MgAl-LDH provided MgAl-LDH a merit of highly selective and efficient capture of radionuclide (UO22+).3 The polysulfide functionalized LDH showed a high removal capacity (qm = 330 mg g−1), large adsorption coefficient values (104–106 mL g−1 at 1–300 ppm U concentration), and high removal rates (>95% at 1–100 ppm, or ∼80% for ppb level seawater) for UO22+. Their results indicated that under low U concentrations, the functional unit (S4)2− coordinated to UO22+ forming anionic complexes that were retained in the LDH interlayer space, while at high U concentrations, (S4)2− binds to UO22+ to generate neutral UO2S4 salts outside the interlayer space. In this example, the immobilization of U on LDH mainly exploits the specific functions of polysulfide. In a further study, Ma and coworkers, intercalated MoS42− in MgAl-LDH and used it to remove 79Se (SeO42−, and SeO32−/HSeO3−). The removal of 79Se preceded by an interlayer anion-exchange process.66 Importantly, the MoS42− intercalated MgAl-LDH presented a super high adsorption capacity for SeO32−/HSeO3− reaching 294 mg g−1. This adsorption capacity for SeO32−/HSeO3− reached a record value, placing the MoS42− intercalated MgAl-LDH amongst the highest-capacity selenite adsorbing materials reported to date. Many other types of functionalized LDHs exhibit impressive performance in the capture of radionuclides, such as core–shell-type LDHs,259 3D LDHs,260 LDHs hybridized with carbon or carbon related materials.262,265


3.1.3 Water-soluble organic contaminant removal. 
During recent years, functionalized LDHs are increasingly investigated for the remediation of various toxic organic contaminants from wastewater due to their high surface area, outstanding anion-exchange capability, tunability and low toxicity.247 Their high surface area and outstanding anion-exchange capacity (AEC, e.g., 272.9 mmol/100 g of AEC for Mg4Al-LDH56) make them promising candidates as adsorbents for organic contaminants such as various dyes.247 The ease in tuning the components including layered metal compositions and the guest species, e.g., semiconductors, noble metals and rare metal elements, hybridized on LDH enables LDHs to be excellent catalysts to degrade organic contaminants.9,10 As such, functionalized LDHs remove organic contaminants mainly via adsorption or catalytic degradation. For example, Zhang et al. functionalized MgAl-LDH by hybridizing surface passivated carbon dots containing abundant oxygen-containing functional groups (–OH, –COOH, and –CO) onto the surface of the LDH.268 Taking advantage of the combined benefits of the LDH and the carbon dots, the as-prepared hybrids exhibited high uptake of anionic dye methyl blue (185 mg g−1). The authors proposed that the cooperative contributions of hydrogen bonding between methyl blue and carbon dots, as well as the electrostatic attraction between methyl blue and LDH led to the high performance for dye removal (Fig. 9a). The high adsorption performance of functionalized LDHs as adsorbents for organic contaminants has also been well demonstrated by many other researches.247,269–271

Besides their high performance in adsorption, various functionalized LDHs possess the ability to remove organic contaminants by catalytic degradation. The LDHs containing transition metals are semiconductors with the potential for photocatalytic environmental catalysts. Furthermore, specific guest species hybridized on LDH further improve catalytic performance in the degradation of organic contaminants. For example, Zhu and coworkers synthesized a semiconducting ZnTi-LDH, and subsequently functionalized it by surface hybridization with C60.8 Taking the advantages of the hybridization in promoting the electron–hole separation efficiency and enhancing the visible-light response, the functionalized LDH exhibited a significantly higher efficiency for the photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes compared the pristine LDH in the. Other types of functionalized LDHs, such as semiconductors hybridized LDHs,273 intercalated LDHs,274 and noble metal and rare earth element hybridized LDHs,178 have also been reported to exhibited high performance in the degradation of organic contaminants.

3.1.4 Oil pollution elimination
The removal of oil pollutants from water is frequently required either due to oil spill accidents, or from industrial wastewater. To achieve oil removal from water, superhydrophobic and superoleophilic materials are commonly adopted.275–280 Functionalized LDHs have been shown to offer novel opportunities as adsorbents for oil pollution remediation.272,281,282 An LDH surface is inherently hydrophilic due to the abundant surface hydroxyl groups. However, the surface of LDHs can be easily modified using a wide scope of functionalization strategies as discussed in Section 2. For example, the incorporation of specific organic species on an LDH surface can endow LDHs with hydrophobic properties.281 For example, Yue and coworkers developed a simple and effective strategy to fabricate a superhydrophobic cellulose/ZnAl-LDH membrane in an open oil/water two-phase system, which perfectly integrated the processes of hydrothermal reaction and hydrophobic modification (Fig. 9b).272 In this reaction system, the two dominant factors to achieve superhydrophobicity, i.e., surface roughness and low surface energy, could be accomplished simultaneously by taking advantage of crystal growth in the aqueous phase and hydrophobic modification in the oil phase. Such membranes exhibited effective separation of multiple types of oil/water mixtures, as well as excellent recyclability and exhibiting stable superhydrophobicity under harsh conditions, making them promising candidates for oily water remediation. Deploying organic surface modifiers to surface-modify LDHs for oil pollution purification has been demonstrated to be a practicable and promising approach.281,282
3.2 Energy related applications
New energy storage and conversion technologies including hydrogen storage, supercapacitors, batteries, and solar cells have attracted tremendous attention over few decades because of the ever-increasing demand for clean and sustainable energy systems.1,14,283–285 Hydrogen is a clean, efficient and renewable energy carrier; it has a high energy density and is environmentally friendly, so it is an ideal alternative to fossil fuels.14 Water splitting by electrochemical or photochemical procedures is an environmentally benign and economic route to generate H2 on a large scale. Currently, considerable efforts are being devoted to fabricating robust catalysts and storage media for H2 production and storage, respectively. With respect to other energy storage systems, supercapacitors which are also referred to as electrochemical capacitors, store energy using either ion adsorption (electrochemical double layer capacitors) or fast surface redox reactions (pseudo-capacitors), enabling a rapid charge/discharge process but storing a limited amount of energy. In contrast, batteries release energy via electrochemical reactions in which ions diffuse between electrodes upon discharging. Diffusion is a slow process, but the capacity for energy storage exceeds that of supercapacitors. With regards to solar cells, the energy conversion mechanism is a light-to-electricity conversion process, with the efficiency of solar energy conversion one the main current challenges. Improving the generation and storage efficiencies of H2, energy density of capacitors, power density of batteries, and the quantum efficiency of solar cells are of great interest and necessity. Herein, we give a concise introduction of the contribution of functionalized LDHs in energy field.

3.2.1 Hydrogen generation. 
Nowadays, hydrogen is widely used in chemical processing, petroleum industry, fats and oils, metals, electronics, space exploration, utilities, and glass manufacturing.286,287 Hydrogen has the highest energy content by weight of 33320 W h kg−1, which is about 3 and 7 times more than gasoline (12700 W h kg−1) and natural gas/coal (13900 W h kg−1), respectively.288 Its high energy density and environmental friendliness make it an ideal alternative to fossil fuels. The development of more efficient electrochemical or photochemical methodologies to split water into H2 and O2 is one of the grand challenges of modern chemistry.289 This requires the development of highly active, low-cost electrocatalysts and photocatalysts with superior durability for both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). As summarized in Section 2 and Tables 1–6, various functionalized LDHs have been shown to exhibit excellent charge transfer performance and high catalytic activities for water splitting. LDHs are relatively inexpensive to prepare commercially and since the layered structure significantly favors the diffusion of water molecules and fast release of gaseous products.14 The exploration of functionalized LDHs as catalysts for hydrogen generation has been explored.
LDHs can be employed as robust electrocatalysts for water splitting. LDHs are commonly considered as OER catalysts, i.e., LDHs are OH-acceptors and robust catalysts for oxygen generation.290 Co2+/3+-, Fe3+-, and Ni2+-based LDH materials can effectively adsorb hydroxyl species and catalyze their dissociation, are well-known as an emerging family of efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution in alkaline media.159 Unfortunately, the HER kinetics is disappointingly sluggish in basic solutions, and the HER activity in a base is usually 2 or 3 orders lower than that in an acidic solution.159 In addition, LDHs are unstable in acidic media. To improve the HER activity of LDHs in a basic medium, functionalizing them through specific treatments such as anchoring an H-acceptor on their surface and fabrication of unique structures, has been developed. For instance, Hu and coworkers hybridized MoS2, a strong H-acceptor, on the robust OER catalyst of NiCo-LDH, and demonstrated that the hybridization endowed with a dramatic enhancement of the HER kinetics in alkaline media.159 The functionalized NiCo-LDH exhibited an extremely low HER overpotential of 78 mV at 10 mA cm−2 and a low Tafel slope of 76.6 mV dec−1 in 1 M KOH solution. At a current density of 20 mA cm−2 or even higher, the MoS2/NiCo-LDH hybrid could operate without degradation for 48 hr. This work offers us new opportunities for developing high-performance catalysts in new media. Unlike the strategy of hybridizing H-acceptor onto an LDH, Yu et al. found that the construction of unique 3D core–shell structures could enhance the HER performance of LDHs.14 They fabricated a 3D core–shell LDH by growing only a few-layers of NiFe-LDH on a Cu nanowire cores supported on Cu foams (Fig. 10a). Remarkably, benefiting from this 3D hierarchical nano-architecture with a large surface area, fast electron transport, and open-channels for effective gas release, the resulting 3D self-standing catalyst exhibited an outstanding OER activity as well as an excellent HER performance in an alkaline medium. Using it as a bifunctional catalyst for overall water splitting, a current density of 10 mA cm−2 was achieved at a voltage of 1.54 V, and 100 mA cm−2 at 1.69 V with excellent durability, which is much higher than the benchmark of IrO2(+)//Pt(−) electrodes. Other strategies, such as producing numerous active exposed edges (e.g., by size refinement) and more accessible active sites, and hybridizing conductive materials to promote charge transfer also showed benefits in enhancing HER performance of LDHs.169,291

Functionalized LDHs also exhibit very promising photocatalysis under visible light irradiation for H2 generation. Wang and coworkers designed and fabricated a Cu2O@ZnCr-LDH core–shell photocatalyst which delivered a high performance in visible-light driven water splitting.98 The Cu2O@ZnCr-LDH nanostructure exhibited a high activity (with H2 and O2 production rate of 0.90 and 0.44 μmol h−1, respectively) under visible-light without any sacrificial agent and co-catalyst, which is among the highest level of the reported photocatalysts under the same conditions. Both experimental and computational investigations demonstrated that the Cu2O@ZnCr-LDH heterostructure fully exploited the synergistic effect of Cu2O and ZnCr-LDH in terms of band structure matching. More examples of functionalized LDHs as photocatalysts for H2 generation can be found in Tables 1–6.


3.2.2 Supercapacitors. 
Supercapacitors are an important class of electrochemical energy storage device, they possess the characteristics of high power density, fast charge/discharge rate, excellent cycling life, low cost, and safe operational conditions.293–296 However, they present a low energy density, limiting the optimal discharge time to less than a minute, whereas many applications clearly require more.293,297,298 Therefore, one of the challenges posed for supercapacitors is to increase energy density without compromising power density, or, alternatively, to achieve a proper balance between the two. A notable improvement in the performance of supercapacitors has been achieved through advances in the understanding of charge storage mechanisms (such as the ion behavior in small pores) and the development of advanced materials.293 According to the surface charge-storage mechanism, two key factors; surface area and electrical conductivity, affect the performance of electrode materials in a supercapacitor.293,299 Given that, numerous efforts have been devoted to exploring advanced electrode materials. Functionalized LDHs have demonstrated to be effective electrode materials in supercapacitor applications owing to their unique structural and electrochemical properties.80,95,99,106,111,113,292,300
As a typical example, Hatui and coworkers functionalized MgAl-LDH by hybridizing it with reduced graphene oxide (RGO) (Fig. 10b), and the hybridization endowed the resultant material (named as RGO–MgAl-LDH) with prominent supercapacitor performances, achieving a specific capacitance up to 1334 F g−1 at a current density of 1 A g−1 in a three-electrode cell set up under 1 M aqueous KOH, and 1092.5 F g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1 in a two-electrode configuration with 1 M tetraethyl-ammonium tetrafluoroborate (TEABF4) as electrolyte.292 RGO–MgAl-LDH also exhibited a high cyclic stability at a steady current density of 5 A g−1 in a two electrode organic electrolyte system with 87% retention of specific capacitance after 10000 consecutive charge–discharge cycles. This RGO functionalized LDH demonstrated both high energy and power density, at 388.26 W h kg−1 (at a current density of 2 A g−1) and 3198.48 W kg−1 respectively, in a two-electrode organic electrolyte configuration. The high performance of RGO–MgAl-LDH in the supercapacitor is ascribed to the large increase in surface area (from 288.3 for the neat LDH to 714.5 m2 g−1 for RGO–MgAl-LDH), as well as to its unique sandwich-like structure. Such a large enhancement of the surface area allows facile electrolyte accessibility at the interior of the hybrid and significantly shortens ionic transport pathways, facilitating and delivering high capacitance as a result. Concurrently, the sandwich-like structure restricts the restacking of graphene nanosheets and hence improves the accessibility of electrolyte into the interior of the hybrid, making it a more effective electrode material. Yang et al. functionalized NiCoAl-LDH by coupling with NiCo-carbonate hydroxide (NiCo-CH) nanowires, and applied this nanohybrid as the positive electrode for an asymmetric supercapacitor.300 The supercapacitor possesses a high energy density of 58.9 W h kg−1 at a power density of 0.4 kW kg−1, which is based on the total mass of the active materials at a voltage of 1.6 V. An energy density of 14.9 W h kg−1 can be retained even at a high power density of 51.5 kW kg−1. These results are much better than many other common supercapacitors as shown by the authors. Furthermore, the supercapacitor also exhibits an excellent long cycle life, whereby a specific capacitance of 97% is retained even after 10000 cycles. The high performance is ascribed to the fact that the nanowire-like NiCo-CH species in the NiCoAl-LDH nanoplate matrix function as a scaffold and support the dispersion of the NiCoAl-LDH nanoplates, resulting in a relatively loose and open structure within the electrode matrix (Fig. 11). Various other types of functionalized LDHs, such as intercalated LDH, core–shell structured LDH, and hybridized LDH, also present notable supercapacitor performances with a high specific capacity, stability, and energy and power density, as evidenced by the many examples summarized in Tables 1–6.

3.2.3 Batteries. 
Rechargeable batteries, an important class of energy storage device which includes the Li-ion batteries (LIBs), Li–S batteries, metal–oxygen/air batteries, have drawn particular attention.301–303 Among these batteries, metal–oxygen/air batteries and Li–S batteries have been considered as promising candidates for the next-generation electro-chemical energy-storage technologies because of their overwhelming advantages in energy density.304–307 For example, the theoretical energy density of Li–O2 (aq) is 3582 W h kg−1 and for the Zn–air system, the value is still remarkably high at 1086 W h kg−1.306 For metal–oxygen/air batteries, their working principle is that during discharge, oxygen is reduced to hydroxide ions. This reaction is called the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). During charging, oxygen is formed. This reaction is called the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Unfortunately, one of the greatest challenges for these types of batteries is the high overpotential at the oxygen/air–cathode, i.e., at the so called gas diffusion electrode, which occurs with both the ORR and the OER.306 To reduce the overpotential for the OER and the ORR, respectively, new generation catalysts are needed. As for Li–S batteries, some valuable characteristics of sulfur, such as its high natural abundance, low cost, and nontoxicity, make Li–S batteries even more commercially competitive than the current LIBs.308,309 However, practical applications of the rechargeable Li–S batteries are still hindered by a multitude of issues, including low utilization of the active material, short cycle life, fast self-discharge, and poor coulombic efficiency.307,310,311 The performance of rechargeable batteries is significantly affected by the properties of the electrode materials. Thus, screening for novel electrode materials with novel structures and surface properties and the optimization of high-performance materials are areas of immense significance to the improvement of rechargeable battery performance.
Functionalized LDHs are potential candidates to the fabrication of metal–oxygen/air batteries304–306 and Li–S batteries307 with notable strengths, particularly low OER and ORR overpotential for metal–oxygen/air batteries and high stability and high utilization of the active sites for Li–S batteries. For example, Wang and coworkers have prepared a bifunctional electrocatalyst by hybridizing Co2+, N-doped carbon nanoframes (Co, N-CNF) with NiFe-LDH, and found that the resultant material displayed a low OER overpotential of 0.312 V at 10 mA cm−2 and an ORR half-wave potential of 0.790 V.304 The outstanding performance of the electrocatalyst was attributed to the high electrical conductivity and excellent ORR activity, contributing from the combination of Co, N-CNF and NiFe-LDH. Owing to the excellent OER and ORR performance, the resultant material could be used to fabricate high-performance Zn–air battery which exhibited a low discharge–charge voltage gap (1.0 V at 25 mA cm−2), long-term cycling durability (over 80 h), and superior overall performance to a counterpart battery constructed using a mixture of IrO2 and Pt/C as the cathode. When hybridized with nickel foam, NiFe-LDH showed an even lower OER overpotential (ultralow as 0.21 V at 10 mA cm−2), as indicated by Yan and coworkers.305 A nickel foam functionalized NiFe-LDH exhibited attractive performance in Zn–oxygen battery with an outstanding stability of over 100 charge/discharge cycles. These reports suggest that rationally-designed functionalized LDHs offer opportunities as active materials for the fabrication of metal–oxygen/air batteries with advantages such as ultralow overpotential and high stability. In addition, Zhang et al. showed that functionalized LDHs displayed remarkable performance in Li–S batteries.307 In their study a core–shell-type NiCo-LDH with Co(OH)2 as the inner shell and NiCo-LDH as the outer shell was fabricated and used in Li–S battery. Specifically, the hollow Co(OH)2@NiCo-LDH with a complex shell structure not only maximized the advantages of hollow nanostructures for encapsulating a high content of sulfur (75 wt%), but also provided sufficient self-functionalized surfaces for chemically bonding with polysulfides to suppress their outward dissolution. When evaluated as the cathode material for Li–S batteries, the Co(OH)2@NiCo-LDH/sulfur cathode was able to maintain excellent cycling stability at both 0.1 and 0.5C over 100 cycles, and delivered high-rate capacities with relatively high sulfur loading of 3 mg cm−2. Therefore, functionalized LDHs with rationally designed components and structures also show promise in the construction of Li–S batteries with a high stability and the utilization of active sites.
In addition to metal–oxygen/air batteries and Li–S batteries, various studies159,312–315 also indicate that functionalized LDHs are of great potential in the construction of Zn–Ni secondary batteries.


3.2.4 Solar cells. 
Exploitation of solar energy is an essential component of the renewable energy strategy of the next generation society. There have already been fantastic developments in the cost effectiveness of electricity generation by solar photovoltaic technology. Developments in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) offer the promise of large quantum efficiency gains and low-cost compared to conventional inorganic photovoltaic devices. However, the present DSSCs still show some severe drawbacks. For example, the liquid electrolyte normally used for the preparation of DSSC devices poses several technical problems such as solvent evaporation, leakage of volatile solvent, and environmental toxicity, and the organic dyes have a relatively low heat stability and narrow absorption bands.316,317 To address the drawbacks of liquid electrolyte, methods have been developed such as adding functional materials into the electrolyte to obtain a quasi-solid electrolyte. LDH materials are found to be a highly effective additive for electrolytes. According to Wang et al., LDHs are capable of solidifying the electrolyte against leakage and increasing the solar cell efficiency.318 After being modified, LDHs even exhibited enhanced functions. For instance, Bastianini and coworkers found that when high iodide intercalated ZnAl-LDH was added to the electrolyte it had positive effect on the power conversion efficiency of the DSSC compared to the low iodide intercalated and the pristine LDH.316 In another example, Du et al. found that stearic intercalated MgAl-LDH could be used as an electrolyte additive to enhance the solar energy conversion efficiency of the fabricated DSSC by 2.17%.319
To address the drawbacks of the relatively low heat stability and narrow absorption bands of the organic dyes, one possible approach is to hybridize them with multi-functional and environmentally friendly inorganic materials such as LDHs, which can provide a stable chemical environment, increase heat or photostability, and improve the inherent light-harvesting ability of the organic dyes.317 For example, Lee and coworkers intercalated a light sensitive organic dye (anthraquinone sulfonate anion) into the interlayer space of MgAl-LDH, and subsequently used the intercalated LDH as the light sensitizer for DSSC.317 The resultant hybrid showed a conspicuous photochromic property under irradiation, and this hybrid sensitized cell showed improved conversion efficiency up to 160% of the initial value from the anthraquinone sulfonate anion-sensitized cell.

3.3 Catalysis
LDH-based nanomaterials have found extensive applications in catalysis because of their intrinsic structural traits and intriguing electronic properties.11,248,320 Examples of catalytic applications in environmental and energy related fields (see Sections 3.1.3 and 3.2.1) have been discussed above. LDH-based materials have also been applied as catalysts (e.g., photocatalysts, Fenton catalysts, electrocatalysts, etc.) in many other fields, such as CO2 reduction and oxygen evolution.10,299 Rather than introducing various catalytic applications of LDH-based materials, we focus on how to functionalize LDH catalysts herein. The key to functionalizing LDH catalysts is to address their poor electronic conductivity and limited active sites. Various aspects of LDHs can be regulated to achieve a high catalytic activity, including flexible regulation of the metal cations in the layers, overall morphology and pore structure, exchangeability of the intercalated anions in the interlayer space, availability of the interlayer space, accessibility of the functional species after hybridization (such as conductive materials, semiconductors, and noble metals or rare earth elements), and providential defect sites as suggested by Section 2. In summary, functionalization of LDH catalysts can be achieved via the modification of inner surface (interlayer), outer surface, and/or layers of LDHs.
Intercalating functional species into the interlayers of LDHs is one commonly used method to functionalize LDHs by addressing the issues of low electrical conductivity and low availability of the interlayer space. Various studies have demonstrated that catalytic activities of LDHs can be enhanced by introducing guest species into their interlayers.321–324 For example, Long and coworkers intercalated graphene into the interlayers of NiFe-LDH to promote electron transport, which resulted in superior electrocatalytic properties of the resultant NiFe-LDH–graphene hybrids for oxygen evolution reaction with an overpotential as low as 210 mV.324 Besides the strategy of intercalation of conductive materials, Li et al. found that the intercalation of formamide to expand the interlayer space of NiFe-LDH could promote the charge transfer of NiFe-LDH.322 This is because the expanded interlayer provided more space for diffusion of the reactants, while more inner active sites could be available for reactions. Intercalation can also modify the surface electronic structure, improve electronic conductivity, and create more active sites for LDHs. These findings map out a promising strategy for further improving the activities of LDH catalysts by intercalating various guest species. But note that when intercalating functional species other than conductive materials as active sites, one should consider the space availability of the intercalated species, because the resultant narrow interlayer space may prevent the reactants from entering into the interlayer.
Functionalization via modification of outer surface can be achieved by hybridizing with conductive materials, semiconductors, noble metals/rare earth elements, or other functional species (see Section 2). But several aspects should be considered including but not limited to (i) size, morphology, and pore structure of the LDH-based catalysts. The decrease in size of the hybridized species, thickness and diversification of morphologies of LDHs, and the increase of porosity and specific surface area have significant impacts on the available active sites (including defect sites) and thus the electronic and catalytic properties of the LDH-based catalysts;213–216,219,245 (ii) matching of the band structures of LDHs and the hybridized semiconductor when fabrication of heterojunctions. The perfect matching of the band structures can remarkably facilitate the transfer of photogenerated electron–hole pairs during the course of photocatalysis. As a result, the lifetime of electrons and holes is increased and the utilization of photogenic electrons and holes are effectively enhanced;248,325 (iii) high dispersion and high stability of active sites such as noble metals or rare earth elements. It is suggested that ordered distribution of the hybridized foreign species is important in optimizing photocatalytic activity of LDHs, and the chemical stability can also be significantly improved owing to the ordered structure between the LDH and the foreign species.31 He et al. summarized this as the preferential orientation and dispersion issue of the active sites.320 On the other hand, LDH catalysts can also be activated by modifying their layers. The most important characteristic of LDHs is that M1+/2+ and M′3+/4+ cations are distributed uniformly within the hydroxide layers.326 By replacing the existing metal cations with more active metal elements and decreasing or reducing/oxidizing the existing metal cations, catalysts with a high activity and highly dispersive active sites can be produced.26,114,187–189 In addition, active defect sites can also be introduced by these strategies.26
3.4 Biomaterials
There are extensive studies which indicate that 2D materials merit close attention in biomaterial applications, particularly in drug delivery and controlled release systems. The development of drug delivery systems with controlled release properties based on highly effective and safe carriers is pressing matters in medical research.327,328 Inorganic layers of 2D materials can confine drug molecules in their interspace and thus, drugs such as insulin or enzymes can be protected and gradually released, making 2D materials promising candidates for drug delivery and controlled release.329 On the other hand, previous studies also indicated that the intercalation of drugs in the interlayers could reduce their toxicity and enhance bioavailability in a delivery process, which significantly reduced side effects.330,331 In addition to their interlayer sites, studies indicated that their outer surface can also be active sites to immobilize drug molecules.332,333
2D LDHs are well known for their peculiar characteristics like good biocompatibility, anion exchange capacity, high chemical stability, and pH-dependent solubility.327 These merits make them attractive and safe carriers for drug delivery and controlled release systems in biomaterial fields.327,334–337 The loading of drug molecules on LDHs endows LDHs to function in medical therapy. For example, Xu et al. intercalated pirenoxine sodium (PRN) and chitosan derivatives (chitosan-glutathione (CG), chitosan-glutathione-valine (CG-V), and chitosan-glutathione-valine-valine (CG-VV)) into the interlayers of MgAl-LDH, and found that the mean residence time and area under the curve (AUC0–6h) of CG-PRN/LDH nanocomposite eye drop was respectively up to 2.1-fold and 6.3-fold higher than those of the commercial product of PRN during in vivo precorneal retention study on rabbits.331 In addition, in vitro corneal penetration on rabbits demonstrated that the cumulative permeation of CG-VV-PRN/LDH nanocomposite dispersion was increased by 5.2 times compared to that of the commercial product. The authors indicated that the LDH-based biomaterials presented prolonged precorneal retention, better corneal permeability, and enhanced ocular bioavailability compared to those of the commercial products.331 Zhang et al. demonstrated that MgAl-LDHs were effective adjuvants for protein-based vaccines.338 They assembled epitope peptides and CpG (cytosine-phosphate-guanine) onto the surface of LDH nanoparticles, and found that the tyrosinase-related protein 2 peptide functionalized LDH vaccine induced stronger cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses and significantly inhibited the growth of tumor. Furthermore, the multi-target functionalized LDH vaccine by co-loading of tyrosinase-related protein 2, two mutated epitopes (M27 and M30), and CpG showed remarkable inhibition of melanoma growth. Their results suggested that LDHs are ideal platforms to load multi-antigens and immune stimulants as effective personalized therapeutic cancer vaccines. Kura et al. reported that the intercalated levodopa in the interlayers of LDHs could be released sequentially, controllably, slowly, and pH dependently with the release lasting for 3–6 days.339 This slow releasing property of toxic compounds from the interlayers of LDHs over time is also a factor in suppressing drug toxicity.
Apart from as carries for drug delivery and controlled release systems, LDHs can also be applied in other medical fields such as tissue engineering implants,340 antibacterial agents,334,341 medical imaging and targeted systems.327 For example, Kapusetti et al. demonstrated that LDHs could be employed as bone cement for joint implants after hybridizing with poly(methyl methacrylate).340 The bone cement showed superior mechanical strength, stiffness, toughness, fatigue resistance, and thermal stability in comparison with the pure bone cement. Peng et al. also confirmed the feasibility of using LDHs as bone implants.342 Chen et al. functionalized an MgAl-LDH by hybridizing silver nanoparticles on the LDH, and found that the resultant material showed excellent antimicrobial activities against planktonic bacteria and inhibited the formation of biofilms.341 Kuo et al. activated LDHs by modifying the external surface of LDHs with various organic groups and demonstrated that the resultant materials could enhance organ-specific targeting.343 Their studies suggested that surface functionalization of LDH nanoparticles could promote drug targeting.
4 Summary and outlook
In this review, we have addressed the currently available strategies to functionalize LDHs and discussed how these strategies may improve a range of physicochemical properties of LDHs. Currently available functionalization strategies include intercalation, surface modification, hybridization, layered compositions regulation, size and morphology control, and defect creation. We have documented how these strategies contribute significantly to the improvement of a very diverse range of physicochemical responses of an LDH, including adsorptive, catalytic, electronic, electrochemical, and optic performances. The remarkable performances endow functionalized LDHs with great potential across a wide range of applications in the environmental remediation, energy, catalysis, and biomaterial sectors. We have highlighted their potential applications in these fields.
Functionalization of LDHs continues to be a rapidly growing field. We believe future studies could be rewarded by focusing efforts on several fundamental research areas, including:
(i) Using computer modeling to help gain a deeper understanding of LDH functionalization, which will facilitate more effective functionalization of LDHs. To this end, the biggest challenge is to set up proper models for simulation since different functionalization methods may not share a same model.
(ii) New and effective nano-hybridization routes. As both decreasing the size of LDHs and hybridizing LDHs with guest species can lead to dramatic performance improvement of LDHs, the hybridization at the nanoscale may induce new features. Conventionally, ultrathin 2D LDH-based nanomaterials are prepared based on exfoliation technologies followed by layer-by-layer and one-step coassembly methods. But the current exfoliation technologies considerably inhibit the fabrication of large scale and high quality ultrathin 2D LDH-based nanomaterials due to the low exfoliation yield and poor controllability. Therefore, from the material synthesis point of view, the current quality, production rate, and production yield of ultrathin 2D LDH-based nanomaterials are still far from commercialization. One of the major challenges in this hot field is to realize high-yield and massive production of ultrathin 2D nanomaterials to meet the industry requirements. The development of in situ and/or one-pot synthesis strategies for ultrathin 2D LDH-based hybrid nanomaterials should be one of the future research targets.
(iii) Achieving ordered intercalation and hybridization. The remaining challenges are to maintain the arrangement of the guest species hybridized onto LDHs with defined orientation, to direct the guest species to a spatially defined region, and to order multiple guests on LDH surfaces. Taking functionalization of LDHs by intercalation as an example, key future studies to be conducted include development of more facile intercalation approaches, especially for two or more co-intercalated guest species, as well as further studies over the basic factors that affect intercalation. Intercalation can remarkably enhance the physical and chemical properties of LDHs, rendering LDH materials favorable for a multitude of vital applications. In addition, co-intercalation of different intercalants into one 2D material has been shown to lead to unpredicted properties compared to single matter intercalated LDHs.1 Thus, multi-functional species intercalation may give rise to new synergistic properties that are unprecedented with single intercalants. To achieve this goal, more efficient intercalation methods as well as further exploration of the influential factors of co-intercalation are needed. During co-intercalation, the controlled loading of different functional substances at various ratios, stacking forms, and relative position of the functional substances in the LDH layers are key challenge. The intercalation order, intercalation medium, and interactions among different functional species and LDH layers are expected to significantly affect the intercalation process and outcome.
(iv) Investigation of defect structures and linking these to specific LDH functions. Creation of defects is a theoretically and practically viable and promising approach to functionalize LDHs, but the challenge is how to create controllable defects. In addition, it is also critical to identify which type of defects is beneficial or harmful to the specific performance of LDHs. Importantly, how to avoid unfavorable defects and introduce useful defect sites are the biggest challenges for the future researches.
(v) New generation of LDH-based electrochemical energy storage materials. For example, if LDHs can be efficiently developed to serve as the host matrix for the intercalation of various earth-abundant cations, a new family of electrochemical energy storage materials can be developed. However, owing to the occupation of the interlayer gallery by anions and the charge repulsion between the positively charged LDH laminate and cations, the intercalation of cations from aqueous solution into the domain of LDHs becomes the major difficulty for the fabrication of this new type of energy storage materials. Recent breakthrough was made by the creation of ordered hydrogen-vacancy on CoFe-LDH, and therefore various metal cations (e.g., Li+, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+) could be intercalated into the interlayers of CoFe-LDH, resulting in high-performance rechargeable cation supercapacitors.344 More efforts should be directed to this new area.
