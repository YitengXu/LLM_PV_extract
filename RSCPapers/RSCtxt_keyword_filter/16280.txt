    AbstractIn this work, we fabricated and characterized organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices with hybrid composite anodes containing single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) networks sandwiched between ITO and PEDOT:PSS. The SWCNTs used were initially grown on silicon wafers by a surfactant-free process based on ACCVD (alcohol catalytic chemical vapor deposition), and then transferred to glass substrates with pre-patterned indium-tin-oxide (ITO) electrodes for the fabrication of our OPV devices. We also integrated H2SO4/HNO3-treated and N2H4-treated SWCNT networks into OPV devices to investigate the effect of chemically-treated SWCNTs on OPV devices' performance. We found that open-circuit voltage (Voc) of our OPV devices was insensitive to SWCNTs' work function shifting caused by the employed chemical treatments, while their short-circuit current (Jsc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) both varied in the order of: reference devices < devices with pristine SWCNT networks < devices with H2SO4/HNO3-treated SWCNT networks < devices with N2H4-treated SWCNT networks. In particular, we found that integration of N2H4-treated SWCNTs into the hybrid composite anode could enhance Jsc by 12% to 20% in P3HT:PCBM OPV devices (with PCE up to 4.02%). The improved performance in devices integrated with N2H4-treated SWCNTs can be attributed to (i) better crystallinity of the P3HT polymer, and (ii) increased hole-transport efficiency of the hybrid composite anode, both induced by the penetration/digitation of SWCNTs into the P3HT polymer layer.
1. Introduction
As organic solar cells are amenable to low-cost and large-area fabrication on lightweight flexible substrates,1–3 the development of organic solar cells as a renewable energy technology attracts the interest of many researchers.4–9 Recently, encouraging improvement in organic solar cells' PCE has been made with the introduction of the poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM) blend system.10,11 To further enhance organic solar cells' PCE, some design rules have been proposed.12,13 One approach is to harvest more solar energy in the active layer, for example, by increasing the thickness of the active layer, constructing a tandem structure, and/or using an absorber with a small band gap. However, as exciton diffusion lengths are small (∼10 nm) in organic materials,14 only excitons generated within this short distance near the donor-accepter interface (the so-called dissociation site) have the possibility to dissociate into free electrons and holes before natural exciton decay occurs. To create more dissociation sites by expanding the effective area for exciton dissociation, donor-accepter bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) architectures with interpenetrating or column-like blending morphologies was employed.10,14,15 Still, even if an increased amount of excitons were dissociated into charge carriers, the propagation of the dissociated charge carriers toward their respective electrodes would be hindered by low electron and hole mobilities (<10−4 cm2 V−1 s) in such organic materials.12 Moreover, another crucial problem is that the hole mobility is normally at least one order of magnitude lower than the electron mobility in a donor–acceptor OPV device (for example, P3HT ∼10−12 m2 V−1 and PCBM ∼10−8 m2 V−1 s).16,17 The unmatched carrier mobilities can lead to a buildup of hole carriers and a field that opposes the built-in field formed in dissociation sites: a phenomenon known as space-charge limited photocurrent (SCLP) effect.17,18 To increase the hole mobility in OPV devices, one plausible strategy is to enhance the degree of crystallinity in P3HT polymer chains. Toward this end, several effective methods have been demonstrated, such as annealing,11,16,19 and template-assisted fabrication of ordered BHJ structures (the so-called ordered self-assembly process).20,21 Another approach to attaining an ordered and higher crystallinity of polymers is to introduce one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures, such as nanorods or nanotubes.22 In such cases, the 1D nanostructure not only helps to enhance the polymer's crystallinity, but also provides a conducting pathway toward the anode.
With their unique low-dimensional nanostructures and high-mobility charge carrier transport capability,23 carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are considered to be promising materials for the fabrication of high performance OPV cells.24,25 In the past decade, three ways have been reported to incorporate CNTs (i.e., SWCNTs or multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNTs)) in BHJ solar cells: (1) replacing ITO as a transparent conducting electrode, (2) blending CNTs with an organic polymer to become a composite, and (3) inserting a layered CNT network in a specific location in OPV cells. In case (1), researchers have focused on replacing ITO with CNT networks as transparent conductive electrodes, due to their high bending limit when applied in flexible OPV cells.26,27 However, the best result obtained with this approach is still less efficient than cells with ITO as the hole collection electrode.28 For case (2), enhanced performance by this approach requires well blending of CNTs and photoactive polymers. However, relevant work has shown that the performance of OPV devices was compromised because it was difficult to eliminate the undesired additives (which was necessary for facilitating the blending of CNTs with the photoactive polymers) from the final solid-state active layer.29,30 Moreover, the CNTs embedded in the active layer frequently lead to a reduction in Jsc, which is considered to be caused by the decrease of exciton dissociation in the active layer as CNTs can disrupt the optimized morphology of P3HT:PCBM (e.g., the blend morphology of the active layer).11,15 In case (3), Chaudhary et al.30 performed a comprehensive study on device performance by placing SWCNT networks at four different locations in P3HT:PCBM-based BHJ solar cells. The results demonstrated that the SWCNT network placed upon ITO or PEDOT:PSS layers could yield an increased PCE of ∼3.7% under 1.0-sun illumination, a PCE value significantly exceeding those previously reported for any BHJ solar cell integrated with CNTs (i.e., SWCNTs or MWCNTs). Compared with the reference device, the Jsc or fill-factor (FF) was enhanced, while the series resistance (Rs) was reduced. This study suggests that the introduction of a SWCNT network on the ITO electrode (or the hole transport layer, PEDOT:PSS) results in a nanotextured surface which could increase the surface area for the collection of hole carriers, and also provide a hole transport pathway toward the anode.
In this work, we fabricated and characterized a series of OPV devices integrated with SWCNTs. Our results show that device performance could be improved when SWCNT networks chemically treated with concentrated strong inorganic acids (i.e., H2SO4 and HNO3) or hydrazine (N2H4) were used. The devices with the N2H4-treated SWCNT networks could give a PCE value up to 4.02% (under AM 1.5G; 1.0-sun illumination). Most importantly, we observed the spontaneous penetration and quasi-aligned digitation of SWCNTs into the active layer after an annealing treatment. This phenomenon can be exploited as a new strategy to promote hole-harvesting efficiency for the fabrication of high performance OPV cells.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Characterization of SWCNT networks
To prepare thin and transparent SWCNT networks for our OPV devices, we employed a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method to synthesize SWCNT networks using a sandwich-like catalyst system (thermal SiO2/Ni/porous SiO2) with alcohol as the carbon feedstock (alcohol catalytic CVD, or ACCVD, see Figure S1). Our previous work showed this method could effectively narrow the diameter distribution of the obtained SWCNTs by controlling the porous structures of the upper-layer porous SiO2.31Fig. 1a and 1b show the SEM and TEM images of the ACCVD-grown SWCNT networks (Note: after being transferred to a glass substrate or a copper grid for respective microscopic characterization). The SWCNTs exhibit the morphology of dense, uniform and web-like networks in which the nanotubes are highly intertwined (roughness ∼10.5 nm; from AFM measurements). The TEM study shows that the SWCNT network is composed of single or bundled nanotubes (typically ∼5 SWCNTs are bundled together). The TEM results suggest that the diameter of the SWCNTs ranges from 0.7 to1.6 nm. Fig. 1c shows the Raman spectrum of the ACCVD-grown SWCNT network. The characteristic G-band (at ∼1590 cm−1) and D-band (about 1350 cm−1) in the Raman spectrum of SWCNTs are related to the graphitic and defective/disordered carbon structure (i.e., amorphous phase carbon), respectively.32,33 The ratio of the integrated peak area between the D- and G-bands, I(D)/I(G), can be used to interpret the degree of sp2 CC bonding (graphitization) in SWCNTs.34 The result from Fig. 1c shows that I(D)/I(G) for our ACCVD-grown SWCNT networks is ∼0.094, which is comparable to those of high-quality SWCNTs reported by others,35 indicating that high-quality (i.e. low defect) SWCNTs were obtained by our synthetic approach. In addition, the optical absorption measurement was employed to quantify the percentage of s-SWCNTs to be 71.3∼82.0% (see S2 for detailed statistical analysis).

(c) Raman spectrum of the transferred SWCNT network excited by a 488-nm (Ar) laser. (d) Transmittance spectra for a patterned ITO substrate (the red dashed rectangle in the photo image) and the transferred SWCNT network on it (the blue rectangle in the image). 
To exploit our as-grown SWCNT networks for other applications, the SWCNT networks must be transferred onto other substrates. Therefore, it is crucial that the desired qualities of the SWCNT networks be well preserved after being transferred onto the target substrates. As can be seen from our HRTEM and Raman spectroscopy studies (see S3 for details), it shows that the transferred SWCNT networks are high-quality SWCNT networks with the I(D)/I(G) value comparable to that determined prior to the transfer process. As rigorous interrogative evaluation on the qualities (including T% and surface resistance measurements) of the SWCNT films produced by our ACCVD process (including SWCNT films subject to a further chemical treatment) had been performed to confirm the reliability and reproducibility of this process in another study,36 this ACCVD process was actually used as a reliably validated process without further evaluating the as-prepared SWCNT films after each transfer in this study. As essentially no destructive damage happens to the SWCNT films subject to the transfer process, it indicates that our ACCVD-based process for producing SWCNT networked films can provide certain potential advantages to help promote the development in the field of organic photovoltaics, such as implementation of this process in roll-to-roll (R2R) coating for the fabrication of ITO-free flexible organic solar cells.37
To integrate our SWCNT networks into OPV cells, the change in optical transparency is a major concern. Thus, it is crucial that the network films be incorporated without causing significant loss in transparency, as the loss in transparency can retard the generation of photocarriers.38Fig. 1d shows the transmittance spectra for ITO substrates with and without our transferred SWCNT networks. The results show that, after the transfer of our SWCNT networks to an ITO glass substrate, our SWCNT networks only cause ∼2% loss in optical transparency (at 550 nm, transmittance is ∼84% and ∼82% for ITO and SWCNTs on ITO, respectively).
2.2. Characteristics of OPV devices integrated with SWCNT networks
The structures of our OPV devices without or with the integrated SWCNT network are shown in Fig. 2a. In this study, OPV devices without the integrated SWCNT network (standard OPV devices based on P3HT:PCBM BHJ strucutre) are referred to as reference devices. For the SWCNT-integrated OPV devices, the SWCNT networks were placed between the ITO substrates and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (or PEDOT:PSS). For devices with H2SO4/HNO3-treated SWCNTs, the acid treatment by H2SO4 and HNO3 was carried out before the SWCNT networks were transferred onto the ITO substrates. For devices with N2H4-treated SWCNTs, the SWCNT networks were treated with N2H4 after the SWCNT networks were transferred onto the ITO substrates (see experimental section for details).

Fig. 2b shows the current–voltage characteristics of the reference device, the device with the pristine SWCNT network, the device with the H2SO4/HNO3-treated SWCNT network, and the device with the N2H4-treated SWCNT network. The major photovoltaic characteristics of these devices (characterized under AM 1.5 G: 1.0-sun illumination) are summarized in Table 1. The results indicate that (i) devices with SWCNT networks have higher PCE than reference devices, and (ii) devices with chemically-treated SWCNT networks have higher PCE than devices with pristine SWCNT networks. Fig. 2c and 2d show the complied PCE and Jsc data for the devices investigated in this work (the number in each parenthesis indicates the number of validated devices investigated in this study). It should also be noted that all the OPV devices discussed in this study were subject to the same annealing process after coating of the active layer, a standard step taken in producing the reference device (see experimental section).

2.2.1 OPV devices with pristine SWCNT networks. 
As can bee seen in Table 1, when compared to the reference device, incorporation of the pristine SWCNT network in the device can increase PCE from 3.40% to 3.61%, Jsc from 10.70 mA cm−2 to 11.00 mA cm−2, and FF from 0.57 to 0.59, respectively. The enhancement in photovoltaic characteristics is consistent with the work previously reported by others on OPV containing MWCNT or SWCNT networks on ITO.30,38 The improvement in Jsc or FF could be attributed to: (1) hole extraction from the active layer enhanced by the SWCNT network, which could provide a transport pathway toward the anode, (2) increased surface area for charge collection due to the “nanotextured interface” created by the SWCNT network, which could help to harvest more charge carriers and (3) the geometrical field enhancement at the SWCNTs, which could increase the extraction range for carriers and therefore enhance the collection efficiency.39 To confirm these arguments, SEM was used to investigate the cross-section morphology of our devices (Fig. 3a and 3b). As is shown in Fig. 3a and 3b, we found that the 2D networked SWCNTs originally sandwiched between ITO and PEDOT:PSS penetrated into the active layer. Moreover, another PCBM-free sample (Fig. 3c) showed that the SWCNTs penetrating into the P3HT-only layer exhibited certain degree of axially aligned order after thermal annealing (i.e., 30 min at 150 °C in a nitrogen-filled glove box). The above results suggest that there exist some types of strong interactions between SWCNTs and P3HT.

(b) Part of the image from enlarged (a) showing that SWCNTs penetrate into the active layer. (c) The quasi-aligned digitated SWCNTs penetrating into the P3HT-only layer (i.e., PCBM-free) coated on top of PEDOT:PSS after annealing (as indicated with white arrows). For (a), (b) and (c), the thickness of PEDOT:PSS is ∼20 nm, while the thickness of P3HT:PCBM for (a) and (b) is ∼440 nm, and the thickness of P3HT for (c) is ∼350nm. (d) Schematic illustration of a device with aligned SWCNTs penetrating into the active layer. (SMU: source measurement unit). 
Indeed, it has been reported that aligned SWCNTs enhance the formation of an ordered crystalline structure of P3HT via the π–π interactions between the SWCNTs and π-conjugated polymers.40–42 The higher degree of crystallinity in P3HT results in an increase in charge carrier mobility, preventing the SCLP effect and leading to higher device performance.43,44 Raman spectra have been reported to characterize the crystallinity of P3HT in P3HT:PCBM films. The peaks at 1455 and 1380 cm−1 are attributed to the CC symmetric stretching and the C—C skeletal stretching of the thiophene ring, respectively. The reported work indicates that CC peak downshifts and narrows in band width as the crystallinity of P3HT increases.45Fig. 4 shows the results of our Raman spectroscopy study on films of (1) SWCNT/P3HT:PCBM without annealing, (2) P3HT:PCBM with annealing and (3) SWCNT/P3HT:PCBM with annealing. The spectral characteristics are tabulated in Table 2. The results clearly show that the CC peak frequency downshifts and the band width narrows in case (3), as compared to cases (1) and (2). The result suggests that annealing is able to enhance the crystallinity of P3HT in the SWCNT/P3HT:PCBM composite. We believe that the observed phenomenon (i.e. digitated SWCNTs penetrating into P3HT) not only provides an effective transport pathway for carriers, but also enhances the hole mobility in P3HT through increased crystallinity.

In addition to the change in the nanostructure, the enhanced performance in Jsc can be correlated with the change in the device band diagram as well. The additional adjustment on energy level by introducing an inter-level between those of ITO and PEDOT:PSS is known to more efficiently extract hole carriers from the active layer in BHJ OPV devices.46 Here, the work function of the as-deposited SWCNT networks, measured to be 4.94 eV (± 0.02eV), is close to (but smaller than) that of PEDOT:PSS (see Figure S4). This allows hole carriers to be efficiently extracted from the active layer and to contribute a higher current density to the output circuit.


2.2.2 OPV devices with H2SO4/HNO3-treated SWCNT networks. 
For the device with the H2SO4/HNO3-treated SWCNT network, Jsc shows an increase by ∼7.5% (from 10.70 to 11.50 mA cm−2) and ∼4.5% (from 11.00 to 11.50 mA cm−2), as compared to the reference device and the device with the pristine SWCNT network, respectively. Unlike the device with the pristine SWCNT network (Fig. 3a), the penetrating morphology was not observed for the device with H2SO4/HNO3-treated SWCNTs (Figure S5). This suggests that the enhancement in Jsc for the device with H2SO4/HNO3-treated SWCNTs is not due to the increased crystallinity in P3HT. Instead, it could be mainly related to the reduction in the device series resistance. The surface energy (or γ) of the SWCNTs increased after the H2SO4/HNO3 treatment (see Figure S6), consistent with other previous work, leading to preferential association with high-γ PEDOT:PSS.47 The improved contact interface could facilitate to reduce the contact resistance, where hole carriers can be efficiently transferred from PEDOT:PSS to SWCNTs without charging or recombination at the interface. In addition, the sheet resistance of the H2SO4/HNO3-treated SWCNT network shows a decrease by ∼70%, as compared to the pristine SWCNT network (e.g. from ∼7 kΩ/□ to ∼2 kΩ/□), indicating a significant increase in conductivity in the H2SO4/HNO3-treated SWCNT networks due to its increased hole-carrier concentration induced by the charge transfer from the SWCNTs to the covalently-bonded electronegative oxygen moieties (i.e., -COOH and -SO3H functional groups).48–50 The increase in the conductivity of the SWCNT networks therefore improves Jsc since the hole carriers can be efficiently extracted and transported along the SWCNTs toward the anode.
In an earlier report, it has been suggested that PCE could be enhanced by improving Voc through increasing the work function of the hole-transporting electrode according to the metal-insulator-metal (MIM) model in OPV devices.13 Moreover, it has also been reported that the work function of CNTs can be increased by acid oxidation.38,51 In our work, the work function of the SWCNTs after the H2SO4/HNO3 treatment was measured to be 5.02 eV, which is greater than that of pristine SWCNTs (see the energy level shown in Figure S4), while Voc of the device with the H2SO4/HNO3-treated SWCNTs was identical to that of the device with the pristine SWCNTs (see Table 1). This result is consistent with a recent study reported by Hatton et al., wherein Voc was shown to be insensitive to the increased work function of the SWCNT networks resulting from a similar acid treatment (mixture of concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3).47 Some other studies have also demonstrated that Voc in OPV devices is weakly dependent on the difference between the work functions of the two metal electrodes.52,53 The simplest approximation for determining Voc was suggested to be modified by considering the effect of dark carrier recombination at the interface.54


2.2.3 OPV devices with N2H4-treated SWCNT networks. 
As can be seen in Table 1, the device with N2H4-treated SWCNTs gives the highest efficiency (PCE = 3.87%). Moreover, the data also show that the device with N2H4-treated SWCNTs exhibits an increased value in Jsc by ∼12% and ∼9% as compared to the reference device and the device with pristine SWCNTs, respectively. The best device has a PCE value of 4.02% (Jsc = 12.1 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.57 V, FF = 0.59), which is the highest efficiency reported thus far for OPV devices with integrated CNTs (i.e., SWCNTs or MWCNTs). Based on the device cross-section study (Figure S7), the penetrating morphology of SWCNTs in the active layer is identical to that of the device with pristine SWCNTs (Fig. 3a), which suggests that the enhanced Jsc can be attributed to the SWCNT digitation/penetration phenomenon mentioned in Section 2.2.1 (i.e., the enhanced charge collection efficiency and increased hole mobility).
One might suspect that the enhancement of PCE for OPV devices containing N2H4-treated SWCNTs could be related to the SWCNTs with altered nanostructures and electrical properties.55,56 To ascertain whether they were correlated, we further characterized our N2H4-treated SWCNTs. The Raman spectroscopy study showed that the I(D)/I(G) was increased (see S8 for details) after the N2H4 treatment, implying that the dangling bonds after the desorption of oxygen atoms or other adsorbed chemical species did not recover to perfect hexagonal graphitic rings. Additionally, the sheet resistance of the SWCNT network increased after the N2H4 treatment (e.g. from ∼25 kΩ/□ to ∼80 kΩ/□), suggesting that the conductivity of the SWCNT network was decreased due to the reduction in hole carrier concentration by n-type doping. According to those results, we therefore believe that the digitation/penetration of the SWCNTs into the active layer is the dominant factor responsible for the enhancement in Jsc. In Fig. 2c and 2d, the data shows that OPV devices with N2H4-treated SWCNTs gave less deviating data and higher performance than the devices with pristine SWCNTs. Although the SWCNT penetrating phenomenon can be found both in devices with pristine SWCNTs (Fig. 3a) and devices with N2H4-treated SWCNTs (Figure S7), it is well known that the desorption of certain chemical species (such as oxygen originally adsorbed on SWCNTs when exposed to the atmosphere) can easily occur after the N2H4 treatment.56,57 This suggests that the N2H4 treatment can change the surface properties of SWCNTs to favor the wrapping of SWCNTs by P3HT chains, consequently enhancing the charge transfer from the active layer to the SWCNTs. Therefore, devices with N2H4-treated SWCNTs gave better photovoltaic performance than those with pristine SWCNTs.
Moreover, the work function of the SWCNTs after the N2H4-treatment was measured to be 4.79 eV (± 0.020 eV), which resulted in an energy level closer to (but still less than) that of ITO (Figure S4), due to the Fermi level shifting (toward the conduction band) caused by the charge transfer between the SWCNTs and electron-donating molecules (e.g., R-NH2).55,57,58 As the work function of SWCNTs after the N2H4 treatment became smaller, the work function difference between the anode containing N2H4-treated SWCNTs and the cathode was expected to result in a decreased Voc. Again, as is discussed in Section 2.2.2 for devices with H2SO4/HNO3-treated SWCNTs, it turns out that the Voc discussed here cannot be determined by this simple approximation either (i.e., determination of Voc using the flat band voltage, which is equal to the difference between the work functions of the two metal electrodes). In other words, even if the work function of the SWCNT electrode were adjusted to be either higher (5.02 eV; H2SO4/HNO3 treatment) or lower (4.79 eV; N2H4 treatment), the Voc appears insensitive to the variation of SWCNTs' work function caused by the employed chemical treatments (see Table 1).

2.3. Observation of the spontaneous SWCNT digitation/penetration phenomenon
From the cross-section morphology studies on our OPV devices (more device cross-section analysis can be found in S9), we discovered spontaneous penetration of SWCNTs into the active layer, a phenomenon not previously seen in published reports of OPV devices integrated with SWCNTs or MWCNTs. Specifically, the penetrating phenomenon was found in the devices with pristine SWCNTs (Fig. 3a) or N2H4-treated SWCNTs (Figure S7), but not found in the devices with H2SO4/HNO3-treated SWCNTs. To elucidate the driving mechanism for this phenomenon, the cross-section morphology of the following composite films, SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS, SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT and SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM subject to or not subject to an annealing treatment were further investigated by SEM. The SEM results shown in Fig. 5 demonstrate that P3HT is a dominant factor leading to this SWCNT penetration phenomenon. In the case of the SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS samples (No.1 and No.2 in Fig.5), SWCNT networks are embedded underneath the PEDOT:PSS even after annealing. Meanwhile, in the case of the SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT samples, the sample with annealing (No.4) shows a more obvious penetrating morphology than the sample without annealing (No.3). Additionally, for the full-device structure (the SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM samples), this phenomenon can be seen for both the non-annealing (No.5) and annealing conditions (No.6), while the penetrating morphology is more pronounced in the case of annealing. This result implies that SWCNTs have strong interactions with P3HT, and can promote the alignment of P3HT in the active layer at room temperature, while the degree of alignment also increases with the annealing treatment (i.e., 20 min at 150 °C).
 Fig. 5  The cross-section morphology of SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS composite films (No. 1 without annealing; No. 2 with annealing), SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT composite films (No. 3 without annealing; No. 4 with annealing) and SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM composite films (No. 5 without annealing; No. 6 with annealing). Note: the above composite films all contain a layer of PEDOT:PSS (∼20 nm), i.e. the total polymer-rich layer(s) for No.1 and No.2, PEDOT:PSS ∼20 nm; for No.3 and No.4, PEDOT:PSS/P3HT ∼220 nm; for No.5 and No.6, PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM ∼320 nm. 
Moreover, our study also indicates that the penetrating phenomenon can be correlated with the surface energy of the SWCNTs. Figures S6 and S10 demonstrate that the surface free energies of the pristine and N2H4-treated SWCNTs are lower than that of the H2SO4/HNO3-treated SWCNTs. According to the higher surface energy of PCBM (γPCBM = 37.8 mN m−2) in comparison to P3HT (γP3HT = 26.9 mN m−2),59 the low surface energy of the pristine and N2H4-treated SWCNTs can favor their spontaneous penetration (under annealing) into the active layer containing low-γ P3HT to minimize the free energy.
The surface energy change in the SWCNTs also raises another interesting argument regarding a strategy for enhancing device performance by promoting phase segregation. Bicontinuous heterogeneity in the BHJ components (i.e., phase segregation of P3HT and PCBM) is a crucial morphological feature because the carrier injection depends on which BHJ component is in contact with the cathode or the hole transport layer. In BHJ OPV devices, the PCE strongly depends on the blending morphology (i.e., interface distribution and phase segregation) of the donor and accepter components (i.e., P3HT and PCBM in this work). However, for the typical P3HT:PCBM film on PEDOT:PSS, the interface close to the PEDOT:PSS layer is expected to be PCBM-rich while the interface near cathode is P3HT-rich. Phase segregation is reported to be influenced by the surface energy of the layer upon which P3HT:PCBM is cast.59,60 As can be expected, at the high-γ interface of PEDOT:PSS, enrichment of PCBM occurs because PCBM has a higher γ than P3HT. This subsequently hinders the carrier injection due to the creation of a hole-injection barrier at the anode and an electron-injection barrier at the cathode, leading to lower device performance.60 To improve OPV performance, composite structures based on the combination of hole transport layers with lower γ and high-γ donor components (or low-γ acceptor components),59 as well as inverted devices,61 has been developed. In our case, the surface energy of N2H4-treated SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS is found to be lower than that of the PEDOT:PSS layer (see S10 for details), implying better phase segregation in the device morphology (i.e., P3HT-rich near the PEDOT:PSS layer, PCBM-rich near the cathode). Thus, OPV cells containing SWCNTs can show higher photovoltaic performance when N2H4-treated SWCNTs were used.
Based on the above results, higher performance of the devices with N2H4-treated SWCNTs can be attributed to the following: (1) The penetration of SWCNTs into the active layer (Fig. 3d) provides a direct hole-conducting pathway toward the anode and maximizes the surface area for hole collection. Moreover, the aligned SWCNTs in the active layer can enhance the crystallinity of P3HT to increase the mobility of hole carriers and suppress the SCLP effect. (2) The devices with N2H4-treated SWCNTs reduce the overall surface energy of the PEDOT:PSS-based hole-transport layer to promote desired phase segregation, and suppress the formation of injection barriers at the cathode and hole transport layer.
3. Conclusions
In this work, we fabricated and characterized OPV devices with hybrid composite anodes containing SWCNT networks sandwiched between ITO and PEDOT:PSS. We found that Voc of our OPV devices was insensitive to SWCNTs' work function shifting caused by the employed chemical treatments, while Jsc and PCE both varied in the order of: reference devices < devices with pristine SWCNT networks < devices with H2SO4/HNO3-treated SWCNT networks < devices with N2H4-treated SWCNT networks. Compared to reference devices, Jsc and PCE of devices with N2H4-treated SWCNT networks were enhanced by 14% and 12%, respectively. The devices with N2H4-treated SWCNTs could give PCE up to 4.02%. The enhanced photovoltaic performance exhibited by OPV devices with N2H4-treated SWCNTs could be attributed to better carrier extraction and phase segregation. Most importantly, for the first time, quasi-aligned digitation of planar networked SWCNTs into the active layer after annealing via the spontaneous penetration of multiple individual SWCNTs previously residing on a 2D structure sandwiched between ITO and PEDOT:PSS was observed in this work. The SWCNT digitation/penetration phenomenon was attributed to the minimization of free energy at the interface of the P3HT-containing active layer and the SWCNT-containing composite anode. The digitation of SWCNTs into the active layer as penetrating electrodes promote the hole-harvesting process by suppressing the SCLP effect to increase carrier mobility in P3HT, which also provides a new strategy that can be exploited for the fabrication of high-performance OPV devices.
4. Experimental
Synthesis of SWCNT networks
The SWCNTs used in this study was prepared by ACCVD using silicon wafers with 300-nm thermal SiO2/3-nm Ni/50-nm porous SiO2as the growth substrate (see S1 for details). To transfer the SWCNT network grown on a growth substrate to another substrate, the growth substrate covered with the ACCVD-grown SWCNT network was dipped into 6:1 buffered oxide etching solution (BOE, J.T. Baker) until the SWCNT network peeled off from the growth substrate to become a free-standing SWCNT network film floating on the surface of the BOE solution. The free-standing SWCNT network was then transferred to DI water to dilute residual BOE solution. The free-standing SWCNT network floating on DI water was collected by a desired target substrate for further use. The thickness of obtained SWCNT films is ∼20 nm.36
To prepare the H2SO4/HNO3-treated SWCNT network, the SWCNT network was treated in 20 ml of 98% H2SO4 and then 20 ml of 46% HNO3, each for 1 h at 80 °C. The SWCNT network was rinsed with copious amounts of DI water after each treatment to remove residual acid. To prepare the N2H4-treated SWCNT network, the SWCNT network transferred to a target substrate was treated with vapor-phase N2H4 in a sealed glass Petri dish filled with the vapor from a 50-μL drop of liquid N2H4 for 1 h. After the above N2H4 treatment, the SWCNT network was baked at 80 °C for 1 h.
Device fabrication and characterization
To fabricate OPV devices with the structure of ITO/SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al (see Figure S1b), the starting glass substrate based on ITO/SWCNT was first cleaned with acetone, isopropyl aocohol and DI water. After the above substrate was dried, a PEDOT:PSS thin film (from Baytron ncbi-n:A14083; filtered through a 0.45-μm filter) with a thickness of ∼20 nm was spin-coated on the ITO/SWCNT substrate (or ITO for the reference device). The ITO/SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS substrate was then baked at 80 °C for 10 min. Thereafter, the substrate was transferred into a N2-filled glove box for further processing. The active layer was spin-coated on the substrate from a dichlorobenzene (DCB) solution containing P3HT:PCBM (30 mg:30 mg per 1 ml of DCB) at 300 rpm for 3 min, followed by a second spinning at 2000 rpm for 30 s, after which the substrate was dried and annealed for 20 min at 150 °C. Subsequently, the top electrode based on 5-Å LiF and 1000-Å Al was deposited on top of the active layer. The cross-section thickness of the active layer was determined to be 370–460 nm (reference devices) or 350–440 nm (devices with SWCNTs) by SEM. The device was then encapsulated for further use.
The photovoltaic performance of our devices (active area: 4 mm2) was characterized by a solar simulator (Peccell, PEC-L11) under AM 1.5G: 1.0-sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). All devices selected for discussion in this work were validated by performing dark current measurements to exclude shorted devices.
Instrumentation
Microscopic studies were performed using a JOEL 6330F SEM, JOEL 2010F TEM or Park System PSIA-XE70 AFM. Spectroscopic studies were performed using a Jasco v570 UV-VIS-NIR spectrometer or a WITech CRM 200 Raman spectrometer. Kelvin probe measurements (± 0.02 eV) carried out in air, using a KP Technology SKP010 system, were referenced to an Au pad deposited next to the SWCNT substrate (SWCNT network on glass).
