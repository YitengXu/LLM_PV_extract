    , Accepted 20th March 2019First published on 26th March 2019AbstractWe have studied the electronic structure of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI) and CH3NH3SnI3 (MASI) perovskite films by performing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on in situ grown perovskite films. For the MASI perovskite we observed a 0.7 eV lower ionization potential (IP) as compared to MAPI. Thus, the band edges of MASI are positioned energetically higher with respect to MAPI. In addition, we found MASI to form p-type and MAPI n-type doping. To investigate the impact of different electronic structures on the line up to hole transport materials (HTMs) we performed detailed interface experiments using two commonly used HTMs: spiro-MeOTAD and CuI. The HTMs were step-by-step deposited onto in situ prepared MAPI and MASI layers and characterized via XPS and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) after each deposition step. Our results show that the lower IP of MASI results in blocking barriers at the spiro-MeOTAD interface as well as at the CuI contact. We also propose an estimated band alignment of the two perovskites to the TiO2 front contact by using the vacuum level as the reference energy. The higher lying conduction band maximum (CBM) of MASI as compared to MAPI would limit the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of a solar cell. Furthermore, for a doped spiro-MeOTAD layer, a VOC value of up to 750 mV is expected at the MAPI|doped spiro-MeOTAD interface, while it is limited to 210 mV in the case of MASI. Our results show that MASI specific HTMs and ETMs have to be found in order to improve the efficiency of MASI based solar cells.
1. Introduction
Since their first appearance in the literature in 20091 organometal halide perovskite solar cells have reached extraordinary efficiencies of more than 22.7%.2 The main advantage of perovskite solar cells over other semiconductor materials used for photovoltaic devices is the possibility of synthesizing them using comparably simple and cost-efficient deposition techniques.3–5 One of the most commonly used organometal halide perovskites so far is methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3, MAPI). The lead content in the material is however environmentally critical, due to the water solubility of organometal halide perovskites.6 The most promising substitutes for lead in perovskite solar cells are tin and to some extent bismuth,7 germanium8 or germanium tin mixtures.9 Completely lead-free perovskite solar cells are so far still limited in the maximum reached power conversion efficiencies.10,11 Maximum efficiencies of 9.0% have been achieved for formamidinium tin iodide (FASI)12 and 6.4% for MASI.13
A crucial factor to achieve high power conversion efficiencies is the use of appropriate contact materials with beneficial band alignments to the respective perovskite so that an efficient extraction of photo-excited charge carriers is guaranteed.14 Misfits between the CBM of the perovskite and the electron transport material (ETM) or between the valence band maximum (VBM) of the perovskite and the hole transport material (HTM) can result in blocking barriers for the charge carriers or photovoltage (VOC) losses due to offsets. Most literature studies make use of the so called “Anderson rule”, which simply aligns the perovskite and the respective contact material with their vacuum levels as the reference energy to predict the contact formation and therefore judge whether the contact material is suitable or not. Since this method ignores the generally expected formation of interface dipoles, the predictions of the band line up are mostly not correct. Furthermore, the presence of interfacial states or occurring interface reactions cannot be identified like this. A far more precise way to analyze the interface formation and contact properties is the step-by-step deposition of one material on top of the other with several intermediate measurement steps using photoelectron spectroscopy (PES).15
MAPI has been intensively studied via PES to investigate not only its synthesis16 and degradation17 but also the contact formation to several different HTMs like spiro-MeOTAD,18 copper phthalocyanine (CuPC)19 or MoO3.20,21 Other studies also investigate the interface alignment of MAPI to different ETMs like C6022–24 or PCBM,22 but also to Au.23,25 Analyzing the interface to the ETM is experimentally more challenging, since most ETMs like oxides require a high substrate temperature during their deposition which therefore rules out the possibility of depositing the ETM directly on top of the perovskite. However, there have been some recent studies where MAPI has been stoichiometrically co-evaporated in a controlled manner on top of different ETMs.26–28
Compared to MAPI, MASI has been investigated using the PES method far less.29,30 So far, no full XPS and UPS data set of MASI has been reported. To the best of our knowledge, there is also no detailed analysis on the interface formation and band alignment of the band structure between MASI and other contact materials.
In this study we compare the electronic structure of MAPI and MASI and investigate their interface formation to the two different HTMs, spiro-MeOTAD and copper iodide (CuI). The HTMs were stepwise deposited on top of the perovskite substrates and the interface formation was analyzed by XPS and UPS. We show that MASI has a 0.7 eV lower ionization potential than MAPI and that in contrast to MAPI, hole blocking barriers are formed between MASI and spiro-MeOTAD as well as CuI. To the best of our knowledge the MASI XPS data reported here are the first systematic surface science studies on MASI itself and also on the interface formation and contact properties to HTMs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Comparison of MAPI and MASI
We want to prove at first that the prepared perovskites are of the correct phase and that they are stoichiometric. XPS, UPS, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV/Vis measurements were carried out on different perovskite films that we have prepared with the same set of parameters. Furthermore, we recorded scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite surfaces (see Fig. S1, ESI†). The atomic lead/tin to nitrogen ratios for MAPI and MASI calculated from our XPS measurements are 0.92 and 0.97, indicating that the surface of the prepared materials is close to the ideal stoichiometry. The energetic positions of the core emission lines of MAPI are at 286.5 eV for C1s, 402.6 eV for N1s, 138.6 eV for Pb4f7/2 and 619.6 eV for I3d5/2, which is in good agreement with the literature.26,31–34 For MASI the core emission lines are positioned at 286.0 eV for C1s, 402.1 eV for N1s, 619.0 eV for I3d5/2 and 486.1 eV for Sn3d5/2. The binding energy shifts of MASI compared to MAPI correspond to the work function difference.
In the XRD measurement of MAPI (Fig. 1(a)) all main reflexes at 14.3°, 20.1°, 23.6°, 24.6°, 28.7° and 32.0° are present.35 All remaining reflexes can be correlated either to the FTO substrate or small contributions of PbI2. The XRD pattern of MASI (Fig. 1(a)) shows a phase pure perovskite with reflexes at 14.3°, 24.8°, 28.7°, 32.2°, 41.0° and 43.6° which is in accordance with XRD measurements reported in the literature.10,29,36 From the UV/Vis measurements (Fig. 1(c)) we determined band gap values of 1.58 eV for MAPI7,37 and 1.25 eV for MASI,29,36 which is also in good agreement with reported literature values.
 Fig. 1  (a) XRD, (b) He I and (c) UV/Vis measurements of the MAPI and MASI perovskite films. 
Our UPS measurements (Fig. 1(b)) show that for the MASI perovskite additional electronic states are present at the valence band edge which results in a shift in the valence band maximum of MASI to lower binding energies compared to MAPI. These additional states can be attributed to the Sn 5s band which is located at lower binding energies compared to the Pb 6s band. This difference is expected based on the ionization potential of Sn compared to Pb in relation to the I 3p states involved in the hybridisation. These observations therefore match with theoretical band structure calculations performed by Umari et al.38 who predicted an energetically higher lying valence band maximum and conduction band minimum or lower ionization potential and electron affinity values of MASI compared to MAPI.
From our He I measurements we determine a valence band to Fermi difference of around 1.50 eV for the MAPI perovskite and around 0.30 eV for MASI. The determined work functions from He I measurements with an applied bias are 4.25 eV for MAPI and 4.75 eV for MASI. From this we can construct energy band diagrams for MAPI and MASI surfaces as presented in Fig. 2. Since the PES measurements that have been performed in the dark and under illumination do not show any significant difference, we assume a flat band condition for both perovskite surfaces.
 Fig. 2  Energy band diagrams of the MASI (left) and MAPI (right) perovskites aligned by their vacuum energy levels. The work functions are determined using He I with an applied bias of −4 V, the valence band to Fermi level distances from He I (see Fig. 1(a)) and the band gap values obtained from UV/Vis measurements (see Fig. 1(b)). 
The most noticeable difference between both perovskites is that the ionization potential of MASI is 0.7 eV lower compared to MAPI, which results in energetically higher valence and conduction bands for MASI. Our observations therefore match with theoretical calculations.38 This energetic difference must be considered while choosing appropriate contact materials for MASI. Contact materials that form a favourable energetic alignment with MAPI will not necessarily form a favourable alignment with MASI as well.
Furthermore, we observe a strong n-type character for MAPI and a weak p-type character for MASI. This is also what is commonly reported in the literature. MAPI grown on n-type substrates usually shows a Fermi level close to the conduction band,26,34,39 while MASI in general is reported to be a p-type material due to the formation of Sn(IV) related defect states.40,41
To further investigate the consequence of the different band edge positions, we performed interface experiments between the two perovskites and the hole transport materials, spiro-MeOTAD and CuI.
2.2 Hetero contact formation studies with the example of MASI|spiro-MeOTAD
The data analysis that was performed to obtain the final band alignments will be explained in detail by the example of the MASI|spiro-MeOTAD interface. All other interface experiments have been analysed in the same way. The experimental data of the other interface studies are given in the ESI† and only a brief discussion is provided here. In addition, we will discuss some of the spectra obtained for the MASI|CuI interface in Section 2.4, since we propose an interface reaction for this contact.

Fig. 3 shows the detailed XPS scans of the N1s emission line, the Sn3d emission line, He I valence band measurements and He I measurements with an applied bias of −4 V. The spectral series of the survey spectra, the O1s, C1s, and I3d5/2 detailed scans and the XPS valence band scans are presented in the ESI.† From bottom to top the thickness of spiro-MeOTAD on top of MASI increases step-by-step. The thickness of the spiro-MeOTAD film was calculated from the intensity damping of the substrate emission lines after Seah et al.42 The N1s emission line of the MASI perovskite is positioned at 402.61 eV. With increasing spiro-MeOTAD thickness its signal intensity is attenuated and it does not show any binding energy shift. The same behaviour is observed for the Sn3d (Fig. 3(c)) and I3d emission lines (Fig. S2(c) in the ESI†). Since this is below the resolution limit of our spectrometer (0.05 eV) we consider a flat band situation inside the MASI perovskite. All spectral information indicate that no interfacial reactions occur as no chemically shifted emission lines represented by Sn(0) or Sn(IV) can be observed. The XPS core emission lines as well as the UPS valence band spectra represent the superpositions of the substrate and overlayer emissions with step wise changed intensities and binding energy shifts due to band bending. Furthermore the C1s emission line (Fig. S2(a) in the ESI†) of spiro-MeOTAD and the shape of the valence band are in accordance with published data.43 The second N1s emission line that appears after the first deposition step (orange curves) at 399.45 eV corresponds to the nitrogen of spiro-MeOTAD. With increasing thickness of spiro-MeOTAD it shifts to higher binding energies by a total amount of 0.13 eV. A similar binding energy shift is observed for the O1s emission lines (0.11 eV) (Fig. 2(b)). Since the C1s emission lines of the MASI perovskite and spiro-MeOTAD are overlapping we did not consider them for our data interpretation (Fig. S2(a) in the ESI†). For the band bending inside spiro-MeOTAD we use 0.12 eV, the mean value of the N1s and O1s shifts. Since with increasing thickness of spiro-MeOTAD its emission lines are shifting towards higher binding energies there is an upward band bending from the bulk of spiro-MeOTAD towards the interface. The valence band maximum to Fermi level distances are determined from the He I measurements (Fig. 3(c)) assuming constant energetic distances between core levels and the VBMs for the different spiro-MeOTAD thicknesses. For the pristine MASI substrate and the completed spiro-MeOTAD film we find values of 0.30 eV and 0.71 eV, respectively. From UPS measurements we determine work function values of 4.75 eV for MASI and 4.29 eV for spiro-MeOTAD (Fig. 3(d)). With all the combined XPS, UPS and UV/Vis data we can construct the interface alignment between MASI and spiro-MeOTAD as presented in Fig. 4(b).

The red lines show the MASI substrate before the deposition of spiro-MeOTAD. From bottom to top the spiro-MeOTAD thickness increases until no substrate emission lines are visible anymore.

 Fig. 4  Measured interface alignments for (a) MAPI|spiro-MeOTAD, (b) MASI|spiro-MeOTAD, (c) MAPI|CuI and (d) MASI|CuI. For a better comparison of the effect of the perovskite on the interface, the vacuum levels of the two perovskites in (a) and (b) and in (c) and (d) are aligned with each other. 
For the MAPI|spiro-MeOTAD interface we do not observe a significant binding energy shift for the substrate emission lines (Pb4f7/2, I3d5/2 and N1s) (Fig. S3(a), (b) and (d) in the ESI†) and therefore assume a flat band situation inside the perovskite layer as well. The adsorbate emission lines (C1s, N1s and O1s) shift to higher binding energies by 0.24 eV (Fig. S3(c), (d), (f) in the ESI†), which is the same trend as for the MASI|spiro-MeOTAD interface. The resulting interface alignment is displayed in Fig. 4(a). The difference in ionization potential of MAPI and MASI causes offsets in opposite directions between the VBM of the perovskite and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of spiro-MeOTAD.
By looking at the MAPI|CuI interface, a binding energy shift of 0.55 eV to lower energies for the substrate emission lines (Pb4f7/2, N1s and C1s) is observed (Fig. S4(a), (d) and (c) in the ESI†). The same binding energy shift is visible for the Cu2p3/2 emission line (Fig. S4(f) in the ESI†). Hence, we propose an upward band bending inside MAPI and a flat band situation inside the CuI overlayer (Fig. 4(c)). The I3d5/2 emission lines have not been analysed, since the contributions of the perovskite and CuI are strongly overlapping.
The substrate emission lines (Sn3d5/2, N1s and C1s) of the MASI|CuI interface do not show any significant binding energy shift (see Fig. 7(c), Fig. S5(a) and (b), ESI†), resulting in a flat band situation inside the perovskite substrate. The shift of the Cu2p3/2 emission lines of 0.11 eV towards lower binding energies (see Fig. 7(b)) gives rise to a downward band bending inside CuI (Fig. 4(d)).
2.3 Final band alignments for MAPI and MASI interfaces to spiro-MeOTAD and CuI
In Fig. 4 we summarize all four interface alignments that we have analysed. Sn(IV) defect states were not observed for any of the MASI interfaces. Before discussing the energetic alignments and their consequences for the device we will focus on the bulk adsorbate layers and potential influences of the different perovskite substrates on their electronic properties.
In the case of CuI, the perovskite substrate does not influence the electronic properties of the completed film. Both bulk films are showing work functions of around 4.7–4.8 eV and a Fermi level that is 0.5 eV above the VBM. For both substrates we find the I3d5/2 core emission line at 619.4 eV and the Cu2p3/2 line at 932.3 eV. The iodine to copper ratios of 1.21 (grown on MASI) and 1.17 (grown on MAPI) are close to the ideal values. We emphasize that the energetic positions of the core levels and the Fermi level positions are very close to powder measurements of CuI reported in the literature.44 Furthermore, the shape of the CuI valence band spectra is identical to powder measurements. Since the doping of CuI is influenced by the amount of iodine45,46 we believe that our thermally evaporated films show the intrinsic properties of CuI.
For spiro-MeOTAD however, we observe different Fermi level positions for the different substrates. Spiro-MeOTAD deposited on MAPI shows a valence band with a Fermi level distance of 1.37 eV which is in agreement with the measurements of Schulz et al.18 When depositing spiro-MeOTAD on top of MASI we find the Fermi level 0.71 eV above the VBM and therefore it shifted by 0.66 eV. Almost the same shift in binding energy is observed via XPS while measuring the core emission lines (0.68 eV for C1s, 0.67 eV for N1s and 0.67 eV for O1s). This effect is often observed for intrinsic organic semiconductors with only negligible concentrations of defect levels. The Fermi level of the overlayer is determined by the Fermi level position of the substrate.47
When comparing the interface alignment of the HTMs to MAPI and MASI the effect of their difference in ionization potential of both perovskites is evident. The high ionization potential of MAPI results in an offset of 0.44 eV (Fig. 4(a)) between the VBM of MAPI and the HOMO level of spiro-MeOTAD and an offset of 0.47 eV (Fig. 4(c)) between the VBM of MAPI and the VBM of CuI. These offsets can potentially limit the open-circuit voltage of a device but will also allow an efficient extraction of electron holes from the perovskites into the HTMs.14,48 In contrast to MAPI, the lower ionization potential of MASI results in blocking barriers between the VBM of MASI and the HOMO level of spiro-MeOTAD/VBM of CuI. With −0.29 eV for spiro-MeOTAD (Fig. 4(b)) and −0.27 eV for CuI (Fig. 4(d)) the blocking barrier is in both cases high enough to impede an efficient extraction of electron holes out of the perovskite.
We believe that these unfavourable back contact properties are one of the reasons why devices with MASI as an absorber material still suffer from low efficiencies to date.
All reported devices with MASI as an absorber layer are based on the standard architecture with TiO2 as the ETM and spiro-MeOTAD as the HTM. It should be noted at this stage that the experimentally determined difference in the valence band alignment of MASI|spiro-MeOTAD compared to MAPI|spiro-MeOTAD is 0.73 eV and the corresponding difference between MASI|CuI and MAPI|CuI is 0.74 eV. These values correspond nicely with the difference in ionization potential of the bare perovskites of 0.7 eV. Between the CBM of the perovskite substrates and the CBM of CuI/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of spiro-MeOTAD we observe large blocking barriers for all four interfaces. With values of 1.86 eV (spiro-MeOTAD) and 1.89 eV (CuI) for MAPI and 1.46 eV (spiro-MeOTAD) and 1.48 eV (CuI) for MASI an efficient blocking of electrons is ensured for all four interfaces.
The interface between MAPI and spiro-MeOTAD is similar to the measurements of Schulz et al.18 They also found a flat band inside the perovskite substrate, a stronger n-doping and a downward band bending of 0.30 eV towards the bulk of spiro-MeOTAD. The lack of any built-in potential in both experiments raises the question of where the photovoltage in the completed device will be formed. For an n-type material like MAPI, when it is grown on n-type substrates, one would expect the photovoltage at the interface to the HTM.
For MAPI|CuI we observe a built-in photovoltage of 0.55 eV inside the perovskite which can potentially change to a flat band under illumination and therefore give rise to a photovoltage.
A direct step-by-step evaporation of the TiO2|perovskite interface was however not possible as the controlled formation of MAPI as well as MASI layers using our Closed Space Sublimation (CSS) equipment is not suited to deposit thin enough layers for the classical step-by-step interface experiments. We do still propose in Fig. 5 the first approximation of the TiO2|perovskite front contacts based on independently measured TiO2, MAPI and MASI surfaces that are aligned with their vacuum levels. Due to their similar electron affinities, the CBMs of MAPI and TiO2 aligned very well. In contrast to that, the lower electron affinity of MASI results in a loss of 0.30 eV of open circuit photo voltage.
 Fig. 5  MAPI and MASI perovskites aligned with TiO2 using the vacuum level as a reference. 
In a solar cell the spiro-MeOTAD layer is usually p-doped with additives such as bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) or 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) to increase its hole mobility.49,50 We prepared a p-doped spiro-MeOTAD layer by spin-coating as described in the experimental section. The sample has been prepared inside an argon-filled glove box and was transported to the analysis chamber without any contact to air. With a Fermi level to valence band distance of 0.38 eV (see Fig. S6 in the ESI†) the Fermi level is positioned much closer to the VBM, proving that the p-doping was successful. The offsets at the interfaces are the first approximation independent of doping of the materials and we therefore only consider an influence on band bending. Since both perovskites are doped strongly compared to spiro-MeOTAD we predict that the band bending will mainly appear on the spiro-MeOTAD side. Thus, we conclude that the band alignment for the case of a doped spiro-MeOTAD film is as presented in Fig. 6. As compared to the undoped case (Fig. 4) the band bending inside the spiro-MeOTAD layer is now inverted and increases to 0.68 eV for MAPI and to 0.21 eV for MASI. Under illumination, this band bending can change to a flat band situation and form a photovoltage at this interface. The band bending that we observe in the case of MAPI is lower compared to typical VOC values reported in the literature of around 1.1 V to 1.2 V.51 The missing 0.35 V to 0.45 V can either drop at the TiO2|MAPI front contact or at the spiro-MeOTAD|Au interface. For MASI, the low band bending inside spiro-MeOTAD will limit the VOC of a device.
 Fig. 6  Proposed band diagrams for the TiO2|MAPI|doped spiro-MeOTAD band diagram (a) and the TiO2|MASI|doped spiro-MeOTAD band diagram (b). For the TiO2|perovskite interfaces we measured the surfaces of TiO2, MAPI and MASI and aligned them by using the vacuum level as the reference energy. For the perovskite|doped spiro-MeOTAD interfaces we measured a doped spiro-MeOTAD layer and assumed the same band line up as for the undoped case. 
2.4 Interfacial reaction at the CuI interfaces
During the deposition of CuI on top of the MASI perovskite we observe a change in the C1s emission line that we assign to an interface reaction (Fig. 7(a)). The C1s spectrum of the pristine perovskite surface is already composed of three different carbon species with their maxima located at 286.0 eV (blue), 286.6 eV (black) and 284.6 eV (green). Similar shaped C1s emission lines are also often reported in the literature for MAPI. The most intense peak at around 286.0 eV originates from the C–N bond of the methyl ammonium ion inside the perovskite. It is shifted by 0.6 eV compared to the main C1s peak of MAPI, which corresponds nicely with the ionization potential difference of 0.7 eV for both perovskite materials. The origin of the other two peaks is still not completely resolved yet. The low binding energy peak at around 284.5 eV (green) is either described by adventitious carbon or products of dissociated MAI molecules like CH3I or CH3NH2 obtained from the deposition process. The high binding energy peak at 286.6 eV is not discussed very often in the literature. Roghabadi et al. assigned it to C–I bonding and therefore to CH3I molecules.52 Hawash et al. describe it as excess MAI which has not reacted to form the perovskite phase.31
 Fig. 7  (a) C1s, (b) Cu2p and (c) Sn3d spectra during an interface reaction for different CuI thicknesses. 
By looking at the evolution of the C1s emission with different CuI overlayer thicknesses we observe that the C–N peak is being damped as expected, while the C–I peak remains similar in intensity. Since no changes in the Cu2p (Fig. 7(b)) and Sn3d (Fig. 7(c)) spectra are observed we believe that the main perovskite phase does not decompose. The most probable explanation is a minor reaction which causes the excess MAI or CH3I molecules to float on top of the CuI overlayer.
A similar effect is visible for the C1s emission lines of the MAPI|CuI interface but to a much smaller extent (Fig. S3(c), ESI†), demonstrating therefore the more reactive and less stable nature of MASI compared to MAPI.13 Based on these results, we recommend the use of a non-reactive HTM when substituting spiro-MeOTAD.
3. Conclusions
We performed a detailed analysis on MAPI and MASI perovskite films in their contact formations to spiro-MeOTAD and CuI and derived energy band diagrams for both perovskites. Our UPS and XPS measurements of the as-deposited perovskites show that MASI shows additional electron states in the valence band which can be related to the Sn 5s orbitals. This results in a smaller ionization potential and therefore a shift of the valence band maximum to lower binding energies. We measure MASI as a p-type material and MAPI as a strong n-type material which is in agreement with the literature.26,34,39–41
Our interface experiments show that spiro-MeOTAD and CuI, two HTMs that are commonly used for MAPI, are not suitable contact materials for MASI. The lower ionization potential of MASI results in a barrier between the VBM of MASI and the VBM of spiro-MeOTAD, which will block electron holes from transfer to the HTMs. It is therefore necessary to find HTMs with a lower ionization potential. In addition, CuI shows an interface reaction on MASI which may lead to interface states prone to recombination. No such reaction occurs for CuI on MAPI.
Future experiments should include an interface analysis on the TiO2|MASI and TiO2|MAPI interfaces, since we expect similar shifts in the band energy alignment as for the back contact. A first approximation by aligning MASI and TiO2 using the vacuum level as a reference energy indicates an offset between the VBM of MASI and TiO2 which will limit the VOC of a device.
By assuming a doped spiro-MeOTAD layer, we show that the maximum photovoltage that can be formed at the MASI|spiro-MeOTAD interface is limited to 0.21 eV, while it can reach up to 0.75 eV in the case of MAPI.
Since the contribution of the cation to the density of states of the valence band is comparably low,53 we predict similar alignment problems for perovskites with other cations, as for example FAPI or CsPbI3.
Based on the reaction of the organic part of the MASI perovskite upon CuI deposition we recommend the use of less reactive materials, as for example organic HTMs for MASI.
4. Experimental section
PbI2 (99.9985% purity) and SnI2 (99.999% purity) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, MAI from Dyesol (now GreatCell Solar), CuI (99.998%) from Alfa Aesar and spiro-MeOTAD (99.5%) from Borun New Material. The glass substrates (Pilkington NSG TEC™ 15) were subsequently cleaned with DI water, isopropanol, dishwashing detergent and DI water again, followed by drying them with nitrogen. Before the deposition of the TiO2 layer the substrates were treated with oxygen plasma. TiO2 was deposited by spray-coating the precursor solution containing 500 μl TIAA dissolved in 18 ml ethanol (≥99.8%, p.a.) onto the hot substrates at 450 °C followed by annealing for 30 minutes at the same temperature. The substrates were then put into the vacuum system and the surface was treated with an oxygen plasma.
The perovskites were prepared by CSS deposition in a closed PVD chamber starting from the SnI2/PbI2 pre-deposited surface layers and subsequent exposure to CH3NH3I vapor pressure. A more detailed description of the perovskite preparation process is published elsewhere.54 The HTMs were thermally evaporated from home-built evaporation sources. All XPS spectra were acquired with monochromatic X-ray excitation (1486.6 eV|Al-Kα) and a FHWM of 0.25 eV. The spectrometer, with an acceptance angle of 45°, was oriented normal to the sample surface. XPS spectra were acquired at a spectrometer pass-energy of 10 eV. Measurements were carried out in UHV (≤5 × 10−9 mbar). The system was calibrated to the Fermi edge of silver at 0 eV, the Ag3d5/2 emission line at 368.26 eV and the Cu2p3/2 emission line at 932.67 eV. The spectrometer resolution of the instrument is 0.45 eV. Absolute energy positions have an uncertainty of ±0.05 eV. The VBM and the secondary electron edge were determined by fitting the background signal and the feature with two straight lines. Stoichiometry is obtained by the integration of the peak area of the most intense lines after a modified Shirley background subtraction. Machine corrected atomic sensitivity factors based on Scofield's calculations were used. Emission lines were fitted by a Gauss–Lorentz convolution. Each interface measurement was carried out completely on one sample after evaporation of different thicknesses of the p-type semiconductor and measurements were taken at the same position.
The doped spiro-MeOTAD films were prepared by spin-coating. 80 mg spiro-MeOTAD was dissolved in 1 ml chlorobenzene. A lithium-salt solution was prepared by dissolving 260 mg Li-TFSI in 0.5 ml acetonitrile. 17.5 μl of the lithium-salt solution was added to the spiro-MeOTAD solution. Finally, 28.5 μl of TBP was added. 100 μl of the spiro-MeOTAD solution was pipetted onto the substrate and after a waiting time of 20 s the substrate was spin-coated for 30 s with 23 rps.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) XRD, (b) He I and (c) UV/Vis measurements of the MAPI and MASI perovskite films.	 

 	Fig. 2  Energy band diagrams of the MASI (left) and MAPI (right) perovskites aligned by their vacuum energy levels. The work functions are determined using He I with an applied bias of −4 V, the valence band to Fermi level distances from He I (see Fig. 1(a)) and the band gap values obtained from UV/Vis measurements (see Fig. 1(b)).	 

 	Fig. 3  Detailed scans of all the relevant core emission lines of MASI and spiro-MeOTAD for the MASI|spiro-MeOTAD interface. The red lines show the MASI substrate before the deposition of spiro-MeOTAD. From bottom to top the spiro-MeOTAD thickness increases until no substrate emission lines are visible anymore. (a) N1s, (b) Sn3d, (c) He I and (d) He I with an applied bias of −4 V.	 

 	Fig. 4  Measured interface alignments for (a) MAPI|spiro-MeOTAD, (b) MASI|spiro-MeOTAD, (c) MAPI|CuI and (d) MASI|CuI. For a better comparison of the effect of the perovskite on the interface, the vacuum levels of the two perovskites in (a) and (b) and in (c) and (d) are aligned with each other.	 

 	Fig. 5  MAPI and MASI perovskites aligned with TiO2 using the vacuum level as a reference.	 

 	Fig. 6  Proposed band diagrams for the TiO2|MAPI|doped spiro-MeOTAD band diagram (a) and the TiO2|MASI|doped spiro-MeOTAD band diagram (b). For the TiO2|perovskite interfaces we measured the surfaces of TiO2, MAPI and MASI and aligned them by using the vacuum level as the reference energy. For the perovskite|doped spiro-MeOTAD interfaces we measured a doped spiro-MeOTAD layer and assumed the same band line up as for the undoped case.	 

 	Fig. 7  (a) C1s, (b) Cu2p and (c) Sn3d spectra during an interface reaction for different CuI thicknesses.
