    , Accepted 25th December 2019First published on 30th December 2019AbstractIn this study, the stability mechanism of the optimized methyl ammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3, MAPbI3)/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) perovskite active layer upon exposure to moisture, light, and heating was investigated. For the first time, the existence of high-valence lead arising from PCBM is confirmed by X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (XAFS) based on synchrotron radiation, which helps to form stronger Pb–I bonds and facilitate carrier transport. Moreover, the degree of disorder of perovskites and the [PbI6]4− octahedral distortion are significantly improved, as well as the crystallization both on the surface and in the bulk. The result of this study provides a fundamental understanding of the functions of additives with electron-withdrawing properties (e.g., PCBM) in perovskite materials and could specifically be extended to systematically design and fabricate high-efficiency and stable solar cells.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted extensive attention owing to their inexpensive raw materials and relatively simple and versatile manufacturing processes as well as the dramatic increase in their power conversion efficiency (PCE) in a short period of time. Perovskite materials possess excellent photoelectric properties, such as high density of states and absorption coefficients,1 shallow defect states,2 low structural disorder,3 low open-circuit voltage (VOC) loss,4 and long hole–electron diffusion length (0.1–1 μm).5,6 The efficiency of PSCs increased from 3.83% to 24.2% in less than ten years.7 The core issues of PSC research have three aspects: efficiency, the hysteresis of mesoporous or trans structures and stability. Amidst all of them, device stability is undoubtedly one of the key problems that must be settled urgently and also a bottleneck question that restricts industrial application. Solar cells are subject to daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations on account of use for long periods. At the same time, exposure to sunlight may result in efficiency loss.8 In addition, PSCs are sensitive to moisture in the air and thus require expensive air-tight protection.9 The stability of the perovskite active layer is connected with many aspects, including crystal structure stability, chemical stability under humidity, oxygen, light and/or interfacial reaction.10 The decreased stability of PSCs is closely related to the deterioration of the surface morphology of the deposited film and the decomposition of the perovskite structure.11 However, little is known about the effects of environmental factors (illumination, humidity,12 heating,13,14etc.) on the morphology and structure of perovskite films and the performance of the devices. To solve the stability problem, it is necessary to reveal the microscopic mechanism of the reduction of device efficiency during the working process,15 that is, the intrinsic driving force and physical mechanism of the microstructure and morphology evolution of perovskite materials.
Fullerenes are endowed with unique physical and chemical properties because of their special structures with double bonds and the cage structure, especially the good capability of electron transport, which makes fullerenes and their derivatives a promising candidate for photoelectric conversion materials. Since fullerenes have better conductivity compared with perovskites, they could act as good electron acceptors to improve the efficiency. Moreover, they may have an effect on the stability of PSCs. Previous research found that water/alcohol-soluble [60]Fullerene (C60) or PCBM derivatives could be introduced into perovskite solar cells, e.g., fullerenol,16 [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid (18-crown-6)-2-yl methyl ester (PCBM) (PCBC),17 benzoic acid fullerene bis adduct (BAFB),18,19etc. Besides the application in planar heterojunction PSCs, bulk heterojunction PSCs fabricated by blending perovskites with fullerene derivatives could effectively improve the electron extraction efficiency. Wang et al. mixed a carboxylic acid group modified fullerene derivative A10C60 with a perovskite to fabricate BHJ PSCs. The 10 carboxylic acid groups of A10C60 could give it the nature of hydrophobicity, which may prevent the intrusion of moisture, and thus improve the stability.20 Chiang et al. prepared a perovskite/PCBM bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell without remarkable photocurrent hysteresis, of which PCE was above 16.0%. PCBM filled the pinholes and vacancies among perovskite grains and induced to form larger crystals, thereby improving the film quality of the light absorbing layer, which is advantageous for stability.21 Other studies on PCBM confirmed its advantages such as more efficient carrier transfer22,23 and superior film morphology.24 Another recent research study revealed how PCBM acts in suppressing hysteresis,25 but the mechanism of how perovskite-PCBM hybrid materials have an effect on the stability still deserves to be discussed. Hence, the improved stability after the doping of fullerene derivatives should be studied in much more depth.
Herein we report detailed stability variation of PCBM-doped PSCs under different conditions (humidity, illumination and temperature) and further investigate the surface and electronic structure through grazing incidence angle X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and XAFS. Combining with other characterization data, the existence of higher valence lead observed after doping PCBM successfully explains the cause of PCBM affecting stability.
Results and discussion
The devices were fabricated with the structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate dry re-dispersible pellets) (PEDOT:PSS)/MAPbI3: PCBM/PCBM/Ca/Al. The active area of devices is 0.75 cm2. The photovoltaic (PV) properties of PSCs doped with different weight fractions (0, 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.075%, 0.1% and 0.2%) of PCBM as the active layer are shown in Table S1.†Fig. 1a presents the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices, where the MAPbI3:PCBM perovskite film prepared with 0.075% PCBM gives the highest PCE values of 18.38% with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.44 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.98 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.80, which is increased by 39.5% compared with the reference one. It is evident that the performance of the PSCs is obviously influenced by PCBM. Subsequently, the devices were divided into three groups and the stability was investigated under humidity (20%, 50%, and 90% RH), illumination (50 KLux), and temperature (50 °C and 85 °C) treatment conditions. The variation of JSC, VOC, FF and PCE with or without 0.075% PCBM in 24 h, 48 h, and 4 days is plotted in Fig. S1, S2, S3 and listed in Table S2.† The conventional solar cells (without PCBM) stored under humidity, illumination or heating are subject to a decrease to some extent in PV parameters. However, the degradation in PV performance is to a much lower degree for the 0.075% PCBM-doped solar cells, which indicates that PCBM can significantly improve the stability of PSCs. For instance, even under an extreme condition, the device without PCBM preserves only 40.9% PCE under 90% RH in 24 h, whereas a 0.075% PCBM-doped device retains 77.0%, nearly double the level. Additionally, it should be noted that the influence of illumination on stability is maximum, followed by 90% RH and 85 °C, and the level of less than 50% humidity, and the temperature below 50 °C has the least impact. As can be seen from Fig. 1b, which exhibits the normalized PCE with time, for devices with MAPbI3 and 0.075% PCBM-doped MAPbI3 stored under different ambient conditions, long-term storage should avoid high temperature (>50 °C) and high humidity (>50% RH).

In order to investigate the reason for improved efficiency and stability after doping with PCBM, the experiments were carried out to characterize the optical absorption, morphology, crystallization and electronic structure of the perovskite. Since the trends of decomposition under humidity, illumination and heating conditions are similar, humidity data (90% RH) are listed as the representative in the following. Other data are available in the ESI.†Fig. 2a shows the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of a pristine MAPbI3 film and the films with PCBM. With regard to MAPbI3, there is neither light absorption nor emission in the ultraviolet-visible region for organic molecules CH3NH3+ owing to its large HOMO–LUMO energy level. The absorption in this region is caused by the electronic transition of [PbI6]4−.26 The main absorption in all the perovskite films is the visible light less than 600 nm with high absorbency. As the wavelength ranges from 600 to 700 nm, the absorbance decreases appreciably. When the wavelength is close to 780 nm, the absorbance drops rapidly, which suggests that 780 nm is the absorption band edge of the perovskite. With the increase of PCBM concentration (0–0.075%), the absorption peak (350 nm, 480 nm) becomes stronger and the absorption area becomes larger. However, the absorption is weakened as the concentration of PCBM further increases (0.1–0.2%). This indicates that PCBM with an appropriate proportion (optimally 0.075%) could increase light absorption. In comparison with the film before treatment of humidity (90% RH) (Fig. 2b), the absorption peaks and the absorption area of the film without PCBM decrease a lot after treatment; besides, novel absorption peaks of PbI2 (410 nm, 510 nm) emerge. It is concluded that the crystal structure of the perovskite gets damaged and the crystallinity is weaker to a certain extent. However, doping with 0.075% PCBM is found to obviously affect the degradation behavior of MAPbI3, as a result, there is no PbI2 absorption peak at 24 h in the PCBM-doped film. Similar results have been reached under other humidity conditions (Fig. S5†), illumination (Fig. S4†) and temperature treatment (Fig. S6†). What is noteworthy is that the decomposition rate of MAPbI3 is faster in illumination experiments than that in the 90% RH test. The undoped film has been converted to PbI2 basically in 4 d, and the 0.075% PCBM-doped film shows low absorbance. However, the peak of PbI2 is not conspicuous at 4 d in temperature treatment, that is, the generation rate of PbI2 is slower. The analysis results of absorption area in Table S3† illustrate that illumination has the largest effect on the absorbance of the perovskite, heating has a minimal impact and humidity is in the middle. In the experimental process, the weakened light absorption may partly originate from the [PbI6]4− octahedral distortion induced by moisture, light or heating; partly because a segment of MAPbI3 decomposed into PbI2, resulting in the decrease of crystallization, the deterioration of crystal orientation, the reduction of coverage of the films, and finally the gradual decrease of the absorbance were observed.

(e and f) XRD patterns of the pristine MAPbI3 film, and the PCBM-doped MAPbI3 films with different mass fractions of 0, 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.075%, 0.1% and 0.2% PCBM before (e) and after (f) exposure to 90% RH. 
The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images are shown in Fig. 2c and d for samples before and after humidity treatment. The pristine perovskite film shows numerous grain boundaries and voids as well as discrete surface coverage, which gives rise to comparatively large surface roughness. Nevertheless, the 0.075% PCBM-doped perovskite forms a relatively smooth continuous film with a high coverage rate (Fig. 2c). The augment of perovskite film coverage will reduce the infiltration of the charge transport layer on the surface of the perovskite active layer, thereby effectively reducing the direct contact of the electron transport layer with the hole transport layer, inhibiting carrier recombination, and enhancing the electronic extraction and collection. This in turn reduces photocurrent losses and reduces the series resistance of the device. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed (Fig. S17†) and gave similar results. The surface morphology and coverage of the film are deteriorated after the relative humidity, illumination and temperature treatment, manifesting comparatively dispersed crystal grains, larger voids and increased roughness. Especially in the 90% RH treatment (Fig. 2d), the number of grain boundaries of the perovskite film increases in the same way as the number of defects, and finally the crystal structure is destroyed markedly. The polygonal morphology with augmented particle size would induce the formation of a more complex interface between the charge transport layer and perovskite active layer, which is detrimental to carrier transport and solar cell efficiency.27 After 0.075% PCBM doping, the roughness dramatically decreases compared to that of the reference, which may result from the reduction of the exposure between moisture and the perovskite on account of its improved surface coverage and fewer voids. Comparing the root mean square (RMS) calculated from AFM images of 0 and 0.075% PCBM-doped devices over 4 days, listed in Table S4,† it is noteworthy that the RMS of the films varies greatly before and after being treated at 90% RH, by contrast, that of other relative humidity (Fig. S8†), illumination (Fig. S7†) or heating (Fig. S9†) treatment has less change. The roughness of the pure perovskite changes from 3.42 to 29.3 when treated at 90% RH for 24 h; in the meantime, the values are 6.93 and 17.4 when treated with illumination and with heating at 85 °C, respectively. Moisture could interact with the perovskite on the surface to form hydrates, which leads to the rapid superficial decomposition of the perovskite, whereas light or heat mainly acts on the entire perovskite film. The film with the 0.075% PCBM-doped perovskite varies from 1.29 to 16.0 under the same humidity condition (90% RH), and the surface roughness is 5.58 and 15.3 after being treated with illumination and with heating at 85 °C in 24 h. Based on the above, one can draw a conclusion that humidity is greatly responsible for superficial deterioration and PCBM could improve this situation effectively.
To confirm the degradation pathway, the changes in the perovskite structure aged under 90% RH were measured via X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectral analysis, as shown in Fig. 2f. The sharp and strong (110) diffraction peak observed for the perovskite indicates better crystallinity with 0.075% PCBM doping (Fig. 2e).28–30 In the humidity (90% RH) test, the intensity of the (110), (220), and (310) peaks gradually decreases with the extension of the processing time, suggesting that the crystallization of the perovskite films gets worse little by little. At the same time, the appearance of the (001) diffraction peak of PbI2 at ∼12.8° demonstrates that partial perovskites have been decomposed to form lead iodide. The (001) peak of PbI2 begins to appear in the pristine film at 24 h, while the new diffraction peak does not turn up in the 0.075% PCBM-doped film, but starts to emerge at 48 h, which is obviously lower than that of the undoped film. At the 4th day, the intensity of P1 (the diffraction peak of the PbI2 (001) plane) is stronger than that of P2 (the diffraction peak of the MAPbI3 (110) plane) in the undoped film. Meanwhile, the ratio of P1 to P2 is much lower in the 0.075% PCBM-doped film, proving that doping with an appropriate proportion of PCBM (optimally 0.075%) can effectively delay the decomposition of the perovskite. The illumination experiment (Fig. S10†) shows that the overall changing trend of diffraction peaks is similar to that in the 90% RH test. Similar conclusion is obtained in the heating experiment (Fig. S12†); nevertheless, the decomposition rate of MAPbI3 is quicker than that in the humidity test (Fig. S11†) but slower than that in the illumination treatment. Comparing the ratio of P1 to P2 under three different conditions presented in Table S5,† it is found that illumination has the greatest influence on the crystal structure of the bulk perovskite, followed by 85 °C treatment, while humidity has the less effect on it.
GIXRD based on synchrotron radiation combined with a two-dimensional detector MarCCD can be used to characterize the interface information which is difficult to obtain by XRD.31–33 Besides, the local structure of the film can be analyzed in a certain range because the change of the incident angle causes a change in the penetration depth of the beam.34 The diffraction arc signals with uniform distributions have appeared at 2θ = 14.2° (corresponding to the MAPbI3 (110) crystal plane), 2θ = 28.1° ((220) crystal plane) and 2θ = 32.4° ((310) crystal plane) in the undoped film as shown in Fig. 3a. The lower intensity suggests that the crystal perfection of the pure perovskite film is inferior. What's more, a randomly oriented polycrystalline structure has grown. However, the intensity of the diffraction arc signal corresponding to each crystal plane is notably enhanced after the introduction of 0.075% PCBM, as shown in Fig. 3b, which indicates an improved crystallinity. In particular, the signal of out-of-plane (OOP) direction of the (110) crystal plane is the strongest with 0.075% PCBM, certifying that the perovskite crystal has a preferred orientation along the OOP direction of the (110) plane. As a result, electrons and holes could transport rapidly and be collected by electrodes, which are finally converted into effective photocurrent, thereby enhancing the PCE of the device.35Fig. 3c and d report the obtained GIXRD data in OOP mode (parallel to the film surface). Normally, the high quality perovskite film exhibits a highly symmetrical (110) diffraction peak with narrow width, whereas the peaks become asymmetrical and broad owing to multiphase coexistence caused by residual stress, impurities and/or internal defects. At a grazing incidence angle of 0.3°, the appearance of all peaks is in correspondence with the diffraction peaks of the tetragonal perovskite structure except that the main (110) peak splits slightly, which indicates the formation of a relatively pure perovskite. As the incidence angle decreases, the (110) diffraction peak grows wider and eventually splits into two discrete peaks. The portion of the peak with a smaller 2θ (corresponds to the sub-phase caused by stress or defects) increases with the decrease of the incidence angle, whereas the part of the peak with a larger 2θ (corresponds to the parent-phase of the tetragonal MAPbI3 (110) plane) is reduced. Moreover, both peaks become wider and the difference between 2θ increases at smaller incident angles, suggesting that the structural difference between the two phases is larger on the surface, which may be in virtue of the severity of the stress or defects on the surface. A sharp and completely symmetrical (110) peak is observed for 0.075% PCBM doping, demonstrating the formation of the high crystallinity perovskite. Even at smaller incidence angles, the peak is slightly wider and merely asymmetrical, which shows that the 0.075% PCBM-doped perovskite has improved crystallization at all measured depths. Fewer defects existing on the surface help to reduce the number and size of pinholes and thus further improve the coverage of the films, which not only enhances the capacity of light absorption, but also contributes to the efficient carrier transport and collection.36 Similar to OOP mode, we conclude that 0.075% PCBM doping could significantly improve surface crystallization and reduce surface defects through in-plane (IP) mode (perpendicular to the film surface) (Fig. 3e and f). In other words, these structures in the film would promote the effectual carrier transport in both the OOP direction and IP direction, which is conducive to the formation of a good two-dimensional charge transport channel inside the perovskite film and sequentially increases electron and hole mobility. Normally, there exist Pb and I ions containing unsaturated bonds on the surface of the perovskite films, which may serve as charge traps to accelerate charge recombination. The doping with PCBM could improve the surface crystallization and reduce the defects and the dangling bonds on the surface due to its coordination, thereby being beneficial to the long-term stability of perovskites.

After relative humidity (90% RH) treatment, the overall intensity of perovskite diffraction rings including the (110) crystal plane decreases, and a new peak with strong intensity appears at 2θ = 12.8° corresponding to PbI2 (001) in Fig. 4a, which indicates that the crystallinity of perovskite films decreases and part of them decomposed into PbI2. Besides, the intensity of this peak for the 0.075% PCBM-doped film is much lower than that of the pristine film in the same testing time in Fig. 4b, suggesting that the doping with PCBM could delay the decomposition of MAPbI3 effectively. The signal of the PbI2 (001) crystal plane is particularly strong in OOP mode (Fig. 4c), which testifies that PbI2 has a preferred crystal orientation along the OOP direction of the (001) plane. Comparing the samples after treatment, it is found that the (110) peak of the pure perovskite splits up at a small grazing incidence angle, whereas that of the 0.075% PCBM-doped perovskite (Fig. 4d) doesn't occur. This result together with the stronger intensity of the latter demonstrates that the 0.075% PCBM-doped film is more stable. The presence of the PbI2 (001) peak is not observed in IP mode (Fig. 4e), further indicating the preferred orientation of PbI2. The intensity of the whole peaks decreases after treatment, even the peak signal of MAPbI3 (110) could hardly be seen at incidence angles of 0.1° and 0.15°. However, there exists a clear signal in the PCBM-doped film (Fig. 4f), which verifies the influence of PCBM on stability. Besides the (110) diffraction peak, the (220) and (310) peaks obviously split at all angles, while the split condition is improved after doping, demonstrating that the PCBM-doped film has improved crystallization, especially reduced surface defects. Similar to the case of humidity treatment, the illumination (Fig. S13†) and temperature (85 °C) (Fig. S14†) tests prove the above results. However, the variation degree of the latter is lower. It is worth noting that the ratio of the diffraction peak of the PbI2 (001) plane to that of the MAPbI3 (110) plane decreases as the grazing incidence angle increases, which illustrates the faster decomposition rate towards the surface under humidity. Nevertheless, this phenomenon is not found in illumination or heating experiments, indicating that the effect of humidity is greatest on the surface. Interestingly, comparing the data of the ratio of the peak of the PbI2 (001) plane to that of the MAPbI3 (110) plane, it is found that the decomposition rate of perovskite into lead iodide is the slowest in the heating test, and the fastest in illumination treatment, which suggests that light has the biggest impact on the bulk of perovskite.

Another technique based on synchrotron radiation, XAFS is capable of detecting structural changes in materials and characterizing the presence of bonding functional groups; thus it is possible to study the variation of short-range ordered structures around the central atom.37 Its application helps to reveal the inherent mechanism and driving force of structure and morphology transformation of perovskite films. Fig. 5 shows the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) of different samples. As shown in Fig. 5a, the absorption edge position E0 of samples shifts to the higher energy after 0.075% PCBM doping. Because the absorption edge has a substantially linear relationship with the valence state,38,39 the shift to high energy indicates that there exists a higher valence state of lead (higher than valence 2) in the samples, similar to some element with a particular status under certain conditions, e.g. Pt40 and Cr.41 The former could be at the state between Pt0 and Pt4+ in some roasted samples and the latter is in a state between Cr3+ and Cr4+ during the phase transition at high pressure, which is different from their normal state. Pb is commonly presented as a divalent cation (s2p0), but a higher tetravalent oxidation state (s0p0) can also be obtained under a certain condition, such as PbF4. The existence of a higher oxidation state of Pb (between Pb2+ and Pb4+) is not only in favor of the formation of stronger Pb–I bonds due to more orbital overlap of Pb and the ligands, which makes the bonding molecular orbital more stable, but also facilitates electron and hole transport, e.g. through electron generation (n-type doping: PbII → PbIV + 2e−) or hole trapping (p-type compensation: PbII + 2h+ → PbIV). We have performed PCA for XANES (Fig. S18†), which is in agreement with our analysis and proved the existence of high-valence Pb. The EXAFS function oscillation signal of MAPbI3 in Fig. 5b is weak, whereas it enhances after doping. It is known that coordination numbers and Debye–Waller factors primarily have impact on the amplitude of the EXAFS oscillation signal from EXAFS expression.42,43 Since the number of coordinating atoms of Pb should not vary greatly before and after doping, it is inferred that the enhancement of the EXAFS oscillation signal is due to the Debye–Waller factor, namely the degree of disorder.44 The degree of disorder of MAPbI3 is significantly reduced with PCBM doping. The fitting results of Pb L3 EXAFS by scattering from a single coordination shell of iodine shown in Fig. S19 and Table S6† further prove the analyses. Previous studies have demonstrated that a tetragonal perovskite structure is not absolutely symmetrical, which means that the Pb–I bond length arranged along the b-axis direction differs from that in the ac plane. The two peaks at 2–3 Å in Fig. 5c could be assigned to two coordination peaks of Pb–I, defined as Pb–I1 (R = 2.4 Å) and Pb–I2 (R = 2.8 Å).45 It can be perceived that the two peaks move to small radial distance after PCBM doping, which suggests that the distance between the central Pb atom and the I atom is decreased, that is, the Pb–I bond is more stabilized. What's more, the intensity of the Pb–I2 coordination peak is enhanced, as well as the second-shell and above coordination peak at 3–5 Å. Furthermore, the coordination peak intensity ratio of Pb–I1 to Pb–I2 decreases after doping, which suggests that a considerable part of difference in Pb–I–Pb bond length gets improved, providing the evidence that doping with a moderate amount of PCBM can improve crystal symmetry and reduce [PbI6]4− octahedral distortion, thereby improving the structural stability of the perovskite.
 Fig. 5  (a) Normalized Pb L3-edge XANES spectra, the dynamics of the shift in the energy of the absorption edge Ek is shown on the right (where Ek,0 is the absorption edge of pristine MAPbI3). (b) k-weighted EXAFS spectra, and (c) phase uncorrected FT of the EXAFS spectra of the pristine MAPbI3 film, and the PCBM-doped MAPbI3 films with different mass fractions of 0, 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.075%, 0.1% and 0.2% PCBM. 
Along with the extension of 90% RH treatment time, a gradual shift of the absorption edge of the PCBM-doped film to low energy is revealed in Fig. 6b (0.075% PCBM-doped film as an example) with the exception that it is still slightly higher than that of the undoped film (Fig. 6a), stating that sectional high-valence lead transformed into PbII. Comparing Fig. 6c with Fig. d, while the humidity treating time is prolonged, the oscillator signal in k-space increases, indicating that the particles in the film have a tendency to grow larger. Meanwhile, note that there is no significant change in particle size when PCBM is incorporated; besides, the intensity ratio of Pb–I1 to Pb–I2 increases after treatment (Fig. 6e), which may come from the decreased symmetry of the crystal and the changed lattice strain that would cause distortion of [PbI6]4− octahedra in some perovskite crystals, resulting in a larger interplanar spacing and/or multiphase structure. Through analyzing the phenomenon under the same conditions, we find that PCBM doping (Fig. 6f) could suppress the distortion of [PbI6]4− octahedra and maintain symmetry. Other studies on illumination (Fig. S15†) and temperature (Fig. S16†) treatment have found a similar phenomenon and arrived at comparable conclusions, suggesting that PCBM can improve the stability of PSCs effectively under complex ambient conditions.

Combining all the above analyses, we find that the introduction of the appropriate proportion of PCBM could improve efficiency effectively and stability. Besides the function of filling the vacancies/holes of PCBM reported before,46 an important reason is first found in this study that PCBM could induce the formation of high valence Pb because of its strong electron-withdrawing properties, which are beneficial to strong Pb–I bonds. The strong Pb–I bond would restrain [PbI6]4− octahedral distortion, decrease the degree of disorder and be beneficial for the crystallization of perovskites, especially along the OOP direction of the (110) plane. As to the efficiency, the existence of high-valence Pb could increase the carrier transport and better crystallinity both in the bulk and on the surface, thus providing a good two-dimensional charge transport channel inside the perovskite film. As for the stability, the high-valence Pb contributes to the formation of stronger Pb–I bonds, suppressing the departure of I and subsequent decomposition of MAPbI3. And the improved lattice distortion and surface crystallization would also enhance the stability.
Furthermore, the stability mechanism for humidity, illumination and temperature is different. First, humidity mainly acts on the surface of the perovskite crystal structure. The interaction between moisture and perovskite provides dangling bonds and defects on the surface, gradually decreases the crystal symmetry and changes lattice stress, which gives rise to the distortion of [PbI6]4− octahedra in some perovskite crystals, resulting in the larger interplanar distance and appearance of the multiphase structure from the surface to the bulk. PCBM-induced high-valence Pb can induce the formation of orderly larger sized perovskite particles, especially a relatively pure crystalline phase on the surface. Full coverage of the perovskite film decreases the number of vacancies and voids, which could effectively reduce exposure to moisture. To further improve the stability against humidity, more surface treatment is important. The illumination and temperature act on the bulk of the perovskite as our results indicated. As to photodecomposition of MAPbI3, PCBM-induced high-valence Pb and the better crystal phase formed in the perovskite film can avoid deep electron traps, then inhibit the electron-triggered process of reduction, and improves the illumination stability of the perovskite consequently. The influence of heat on the stability also has a relationship with the bulk of the perovskite. High-temperature prevailingly brings about lattice expansion and/or electron–phonon interaction, which will destroy crystal symmetry even crystal texture. PCBM-induced high-valence Pb can restrain crystal size becoming greater and improve lattice distortion. Moreover, carrier diffusion length and mobility gradually decrease, which is connected with thermal charge traps and recombination; however, the existence of high valence Pb leads to stabilize the highly efficient charge transportation. In consequence, high-valence Pb such as Pb4+, which would not change the crystal phase but supply a stronger Pb–I bond, might be a good choice to change the bulk structure. This work is in progress in our lab.
Conclusions
We experimentally research the effect of PCBM on the stability and efficiency in CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM bulk heterojunction PSCs via UV-Vis, AFM, XRD, GIXRD and XANES. The data suggest that the perovskite with the optimal 0.075% PCBM turns out to be most efficient and stable under humidity (20%, 50%, and 90% RH), illumination (50 KLux) and heating (50 °C and 85 °C) conditions. The introduction of PCBM contributes to higher valence Pb on account of the electron-withdrawing properties of PCBM, which is conducive to forming stronger Pb–I bonds and facilitates carrier transport. The stronger Pb–I bond can decrease the degree of disorder and inhibit the [PbI6]4− octahedral distortion, combined with the improved surface crystallization and good two-dimensional charge transport channel obtained by GIXRD, supporting the viewpoint that PCBM could enhance the efficiency and stability of perovskites under complex ambient conditions. Our findings provide important guidance with regard to fabricating efficient and stable perovskite solar cells by means of introducing dopants with a high oxidation state or electron-drawing groups.
Experimental
Device fabrication
Etched ITO (15 Ω per square) was first cleaned using detergent, deionized water, ethanol, acetone and isopropanol, respectively, and then dried in a nitrogenous atmosphere. A PEDOT:PSS (Clevious™ P VP AI 4083) layer was prepared by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 60 s and then heated at 140 °C for 20 min. To prepare the precursor solutions, PbI2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and CH3CH2I (Liaoning You Xuan Technology Co., Ltd) were dissolved in GBL and DMSO (v/v 7:3, J&K Scientific Ltd.) at a concentration of 1 M and then stirred at 60 °C overnight. Different concentrations of PCBM (Aladdin) (0, 0.01 wt%, 0.05 wt%, 0.075 wt%, 0.1 wt% and 0.2 wt%, respectively) were added to the perovskite precursor solution and stirred to dissolve fully. The perovskite layer was spin-coated onto the substrate at 4500 rpm for 30 s, and 100 μL toluene (J&K Scientific Ltd.) was dropped in 25 s. Then the films were heated at 100 °C for 10 min subsequently. PCBM (20 mg mL−1) was dissolved in chlorobenzene (J&K Scientific Ltd.) and spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, Al electrodes of 100 nm thickness were deposited by thermal evaporation.
Devices were exposed to varying environmental conditions via an incubator, and the measurements were performed periodically with times of 24 h, 48 h and 4 d. For the humidity studies, the perovskite films were stored at room temperature (measured to be 25 °C ± 1 °C) in the dark and the relative humidity was controlled to the desired humidity (20%, 50%, and 90% RH ± 5%). Light exposure was carried out with 1 sun white light illumination supplied by an array of white LEDs, and the temperature and humidity were closely controlled at 25 °C ± 1 °C and 20% RH ± 5%. For the thermal experiments, the devices were placed in a dark incubator with a temperature of 50 °C or 85 °C and humidity of 20% ± 5%.
Characterization
The J–V characteristics of the perovskite solar cells were measured using a Newport solar simulator with a Keithley 2400 source meter under an AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) condition. The UV-visible spectra were measured using an Agilent Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrometer. The AFM images were obtained using the tapping mode on a Bruker Dimension EDGE. The XRD spectra were obtained with a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The GIXRD data were obtained using an X-ray diffuse scattering station on the 1W1A beam line in the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF), and the wavelength used for GIXRD is 1.5406 Å. As for IP mode in the experiment, when the incident X-ray (<1°) was applied, the diffracted lattice plane is almost parallel to the line direction and normal to the substrate. In the case of the OOP mode, when the incident X-ray (<1°) was applied, the diffracted lattice plane is almost perpendicular to the line direction and normal to the substrate. Fluorescence-yield XAFS at the Pb L3-edge was carried out at room temperature at the BSRF on the 1W1B beam line. All the devices were tested in air.
