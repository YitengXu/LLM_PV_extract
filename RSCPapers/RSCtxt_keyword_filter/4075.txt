    , Accepted 22nd March 2016First published on 23rd March 2016AbstractIn this work, solution-processed organic solar cells with conjugated small molecules both as electron donors and electron acceptors were studied, where the influence of the chemical structures of the donor and acceptor on the device performance was systematically investigated. A small molecular donor incorporating binary electron-deficient units, diketopyrrolopyrrole and pentacyclic aromatic bislactam, was synthesized to provide a low band gap of 1.65 eV and low-lying energy levels. Three molecules, from a fullerene derivative to non-fullerene perylene bisimide-based acceptors, were selected as electron acceptors to construct organic solar cells. The results showed that fullerene-based solar cells provided power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 4.8%, while the non-fullerene solar cells also exhibited promising PCEs of 2.4% and 3.5%, with a photoresponse of up to 750 nm. Further analysis of the bulk-heterojunction systems between donors and acceptors revealed that the relatively low carrier mobilities of the non-fullerene acceptors and the large phase separations are mainly responsible for the less efficient solar cells. Our results demonstrate that molecules containing several electron-deficient units can effectively reduce the band gap of small molecules, and thus offer great potential for realizing high performance fullerene and non-fullerene solar cells.
Introduction
Non-fullerene organic solar cells have made great progress in recent years.1–5 Semiconducting materials can be intentionally designed and synthesized in terms of distinct absorption spectra, energy levels, electron mobilities and crystalline properties, while it is difficult to realize these purposes with fullerene derivatives due to the limited modifications of their chemical structures. As a result, non-fullerene solar cells have achieved high performances with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) above 7%,6–12 which are approaching the PCEs of 10% for fullerene-based solar cells.13–16
Solution processed non-fullerene solar cells can be separated into four catalogues: polymer donor – small molecular acceptor, polymer donor – polymer acceptor, small molecular donor – polymer acceptor and small molecular donor – small molecular acceptor. Several conjugated polymer donors blended with small molecule or polymer acceptors have been reported to provide high PCEs, while non-fullerene solar cells created by using small molecules as electron donors have presented relatively low performances with PCEs < 6%.17–26 These lag behind fullerene-based small molecule solar cells with PCEs > 9%.27–29 In light of their admirable properties such as monodispersity, high purity and good crystalline properties compared to conjugated polymers, conjugated small molecules are promising candidates for organic solar cells. In particular, it would be interesting to explore non-fullerene solar cells based on small molecules both as electron donor and electron acceptor.
Small molecules, as electron donors, firstly require broad absorption spectra to harvest more photons from sunlight if they are to be used in high performance solar cells. For this purpose, several conjugated molecules with long conjugated backbones were designed to obtain optical band gaps below 1.6 eV and successfully achieve PCEs > 7% in fullerene-based solar cells.27–33 However, these molecules with long conjugated backbones require multi-synthetic steps, which increase the synthesis complexity34 and the difficulties for purification, and so can lead to a low total yield.35 Therefore, it would be very useful to design conjugated molecules with short conjugated backbones which meanwhile have small band gaps for solar cells.
In this work, we explore conjugated small molecules with small band gaps which maintain a short conjugated backbone. The design starts from selecting a strongly electron-deficient unit, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), as a building block. DPP-based conjugated polymers with near-infrared absorption up to 1000 nm have been widely reported36 and show high performance in fullerene-based solar cells.37–39 In order to realize small band gap molecules, another weakly electron-deficient unit, pentacyclic aromatic bislactam (PCL),40 was introduced. It has been reported that conjugated molecules41–43 and polymers containing several electron-deficient units44–47 can have small band gaps and meanwhile keep low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, which is beneficial for low energy loss. The new molecule, PCLDPP (Fig. 1a), was synthesized to show a band gap of 1.65 eV with an absorption onset close to 800 nm. This molecule was applied in photovoltaic devices, resulting in the PCE of 4.8% in fullerene-based solar cells and 3.5% in non-fullerene solar cells by using a twisted perylene bisimide dimer acceptor (Fig. 1b). The slightly lower PCE of the non-fullerene solar cells was mainly due to the low electron mobilities of the non-fullerene acceptors and the large phase separation in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) systems. Our results demonstrate that the strategy of using several electron-deficient units to construct conjugated molecules can effectively lower the band gap and has great potential application in fullerene and non-fullerene solar cells.

Experimental
Materials and measurements
All synthetic procedures were performed under an argon atmosphere. Commercial chemicals were used as received. Toluene was distilled over sodium under an argon atmosphere and benzophenone was used as the indicator. The monomer 3-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-2,5-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-6-(thiophen-2-yl)-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (1)48 and 4,10-bis(2-butyloctyl)-2,8-bis(trimethylstannyl)-4,10-dihydrothieno[2′,3′:5,6]pyrido[3,4-g]thieno[3,2-c]isoquinoline-5,11-dione (2)49 were synthesized according to the literature procedures.

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz and 100 MHz on a Bruker AVANCE spectrometer with CDCl3 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. Absorption spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-570 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry was conducted with a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1 under an inert atmosphere with 1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in CH2Cl2 as the electrolyte. The working electrode was a platinum disk, the counter electrode was a silver electrode, and an Ag/AgCl quasi-reference electrode was used. The concentration of the sample in the electrolyte was approximately 1 mM, based on monomers. Fc/Fc+ was used as an internal standard. 2D-GIWAXS measurements were conducted on a Xenocs-SAXS/WAXS system with an X-ray wavelength of 1.5418 Å. The film samples were irradiated at a fixed angle of 0.2°. All film samples were prepared by spin-coating solutions on Si/SiO2 substrate. Steady state fluorescence spectra were recorded at room temperature using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS980 double-monochromator luminescence spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen-cooled near-IR sensitive photomultiplier (Hamamatsu).
The organic field-effect transistors were fabricated on a commercial Si/SiO2/Au substrate purchased from First MEMS Co. Ltd. A heavily N-doped Si wafer and a SiO2 layer of 300 nm served as the gate electrode and dielectric layer, respectively. The Ti (2 nm)/Au (28 nm) source–drain electrodes were sputtered and patterned by a lift-off technique. Before deposition of the organic semiconductor, the gate dielectrics were treated with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) in a vacuum oven at a temperature of 120 °C, forming OTS self-assembled monolayers. The treated substrates were rinsed successively with hexane, chloroform, and isopropyl alcohol. Polymer thin films were spin-coated on the substrate from solution with a thickness of around 30–50 nm. The devices were thermally annealed at the stated temperature for 10 min in a glovebox filled with N2. The devices were measured on a Keithley 4200 SCS semiconductor parameter analyzer at room temperature. The mobilities were calculated from the saturation region with the following equation: ISD = (W/2L)Ciμ(VG − VT)2, where ISD is the source–drain current, W is the channel width (1400 μm), L is the channel length (40 μm), μ is the field-effect mobility, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric layer, and VG and VT are the gate voltage and threshold voltage, respectively. This equation defines the important characteristics of electron mobility (μ), on/off ratio (Ion/Ioff), and threshold voltage (VT), which can be deduced by the equation from the plot of current–voltage.
Photovoltaic devices were made by spin-coating poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Clevios P, VP AI 4083) onto pre-cleaned, patterned ITO substrates. The photoactive layers were deposited by spin-coating a chloroform solution containing PCLDPP, the electron acceptors and the appropriate amount of processing additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) in air. LiF (1 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited by vacuum evaporation at ca. 4 × 10−5 Pa as the back electrode.
The active area of each cell was 0.04 cm2. The J–V characteristics were measured by a Keithley 2400 source meter unit under an AM1.5G spectrum from a solar simulator (Enlitech model SS-F5-3A). The solar simulator illumination intensity was determined at 100 mW cm−2 using a monocrystal silicon reference cell with a KG5 filter. Short circuit currents (Jsc) under AM1.5G conditions were estimated from the spectral response and convolution with the solar spectrum. The external quantum efficiency was measured by a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enli Technology Co., Ltd.). The thicknesses of the active layers in the photovoltaic devices were measured on a Veeco Dektak XT profilometer.
PCLDPP
To a degassed solution of compound 1 (178 mg, 0.29 mmol) and compound 2 (138 mg, 0.14 mmol) in toluene (4 mL) and DMF (0.4 mL), tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (8.0 mg, 8.7 μmol) and triphenylphosphine (9.1 mg, 34.8 μmol) were added. The mixture was stirred at 115 °C for 24 h, after which the reaction mixture was precipitated in methanol. The resulting solid was subjected to column chromatography (silica, eluent CHCl3/THF, 90%/10%) to afford PCLDPP (214 mg, 89.6%) as a dark solid. 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ = 8.94 (d, 2H), 8.91 (d, 2H), 8.56 (s, 2H), 7.55 (d, 2H), 7.19 (m, 4H), 7.01 (s, 2H), 4.26 (m, 4H), 4.01 (m, 8H), 1.95 (m, 6H), 1.60–1.20 (m, 64H), 0.86 (m, 36H). 13C NMR (101 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 161.5, 161.4, 161.2, 141.2, 140.2, 139.9, 138.9, 136.8, 136.1, 135.8, 130.7, 129.9, 129.4, 129.3, 128.5, 127.0, 125.4, 123.9, 118.0, 114.2, 108.7, 108.2, 49.7, 46.1, 39.4, 39.3, 37.3, 32.0, 31.8, 31.5, 30.4, 29.9, 29.0, 28.5, 26.8, 23.8, 23.7, 23.2, 22.8, 14.2, 10.7.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic procedure for the molecule PCLDPP is presented in Fig. 1a. Ethylhexyl and butyloctyl side chains were introduced into the DPP and PCL backbone to improve the solubility. The molecule PCLDPP was synthesized from monobromo-bisthienyl-DPP and bis(trimethylstannyl)PCL via a Stille cross-coupling reaction. The molecule could be easily purified via column chromatography with a high yield of 89.6%. PCLDPP also shows good solubility in chloroform (CHCl3) and ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), which is beneficial for solution-processed solar cells.
Optical and electrochemical properties
The molecule PCLDPP exhibits wide band gap absorption with an onset at 675 nm in CHCl3 solution, which is red-shifted to 752 nm in thin film (Fig. S1, ESI†). Two absorption peaks located at 634 nm and 695 nm were observed with the J-aggregation of PCLDPP in thin film due to the higher intensity of the peaks at 695 nm. Optical absorption of the three electron acceptors, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), perylene bisimide (SdiPBI)10 and a derivative of SdiPBI, SdiPBI-S6, produced by the insertion of two thiophene units in the bay positions, are also shown in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table 1. PCBM shows poor absorption in the region of visible light, while SdiPBI and SdiPBI-S have strong absorption between 400 and 600 nm. The complementary absorption of PCLDPP and PBI derivatives offers the potential to enhance the photocurrent of solar cells.

The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PCLDPP were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements and referenced to a work function of ferrocene of −5.23 eV (Fig. S2, ESI† and Table 1). The energy levels of PCBM, SdiPBI and SdiPBI-S are also summarized in Table 1 for comparison. The molecule PCLDPP shows the deep HOMO level of −5.62 eV, which would provide a high open circuit voltage (Voc) in solar cells. In addition, PCLDPP has a low-lying LUMO level of −3.74 eV that is much lower than those of similar DPP based molecules with phenyl or thienyl groups as central units.50 This indicates that the PCL weak acceptor unit can effectively reduce the LUMO level of the molecule. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations also show that the HOMO and LUMO of PCLDPP are well-delocalized over the conjugated backbone (Fig. S3, ESI†), indicating that the DPP and PCL units together influence the energy levels of PCLDPP. The electron acceptors, PCBM, SdiPBI and SdiPBI-S, have LUMO levels of −3.97 eV, −3.92 eV and −3.85 eV, respectively, resulting in a LUMO offset between PCLDPP and acceptor of below 0.3 eV. These excess energies should be enough for exciton dissociation into free charges, as reported in several organic photovoltaic systems recently.51–54
Charge carrier mobility
The charge carrier mobility of the molecule is crucial for solar cell performance, since a low mobility will enhance the charge recombination and therefore reduce the photocurrent in solar cells. The hole mobility of the molecule PCLDPP was measured by field effect transistors (FETs) with a bottom gate – bottom contact (BGBC) configuration. The silicon dioxide gate dielectric used was passivated with OTS, and PCLDPP thin films were solution-processed from CHCl3. Initially, the FET devices based on PCLDPP thin film without thermal annealing showed a poor hole mobility of 6.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. 3a and b, Table 2). After the thin film was thermally annealed at 80 °C for 10 min, the hole mobility was dramatically enhanced to 2.6 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a threshold voltage (VT) of −8.8 V and a high on/off ratio of 108. When the thin film was thermally annealed at higher temperatures, such as 130 °C and 150 °C, the hole mobilities slightly dropped (Table 2). The morphology of the PCLDPP thin films were analyzed by atom force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. S4, ESI†. PCLDPP shows a smooth thin film without thermal annealing, and exhibits crystal domains after thermal annealing at 80 °C. This enhanced crystalline property would help to improve carrier mobility. PCLDPP also shows similar hole mobility compared to other high performance DPP polymers,55 which will be beneficial for efficient solar cells.

Photovoltaic properties
The molecule PCLDPP as the electron donor was applied in organic solar cells when using PCBM, SdiPBI or SdiPBI-S as the electron acceptor. The photoactive layers containing PCLDPP and an electron acceptor were fabricated onto ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates, before evaporating LiF/Al as the anode. The photoactive layers were carefully optimized with respect to the content of additive, the ratio of donor to acceptor and the thickness (Tables S1–S9 and Fig. S5–S13, ESI†). The optimized performance of the solar cells is shown in Fig. 4 and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3.

The PCLDPP:PCBM cell showed the best PCE of 4.8% with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 9.7 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.89 V and fill factor (FF) of 0.56 when solution-processed from CHCl3 with 0.5% DIO as the additive and a ratio of donor to acceptor of 1:1. When using SdiPBI as the electron acceptor, the photoactive layers with a ratio of donor to acceptor of 2:1 fabricated from CHCl3 with 1% DIO provided the best performance of 2.4% with a Jsc of 6.1 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.92 V and FF of 0.42. The PCE of non-fullerene solar cells based on PCLDPP:SdiPBI-S was higher at 3.5% with an enhanced Jsc, Voc and FF compared to SdiPBI based solar cells. Similar results have also been observed in polymer solar cells based on SdiPBI-S as the electron acceptor.10
However, the solar cells based on non-fullerene acceptors in this work show relatively low PCEs compared to PCBM-based solar cells, which is mainly attributed to their low Jsc values. The differences in Jsc can also be observed in external quantum efficiencies (EQE), as shown in Fig. 4b. PCLDPP:PCBM cells show a high photoresponse from 500 nm to 700 nm with a maximum EQE of 0.56 at the molecular absorption region. The cells based on SdiPBI and SdiPBI-S have broad photoresponses due to the absorption of the electron acceptors, but the maximum EQE is greatly reduced to below 0.35.
Morphology investigation
It will be useful to further analyse the difference of photocurrent and PCE based on fullerene and non-fullerene solar cells. The photocurrent of organic solar cells relates to the process in which the photons are converted into free charge. This involves exciton generation, diffusion into the interface of donor and acceptor, separation into free charges and charge transport to the electrode. We firstly examined the charge transport properties in bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) systems by space charge limit current (SCLC) measurement, as shown in Fig. 5 and Table 4. The hole mobility in BHJ systems was measured by hole-only devices with ITO/PEDOT:PSS/pure or blended thin films/Au; the electron mobility was measured by electron-only devices with ITO/ZnO/pure or blended thin films/LiF/Al. PCLDPP had similar hole mobilities of around 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 in both pure and blended thin films. The hole mobilities of blended thin films were also measured by FET devices, and were comparable to that of pure PCLDPP thin film (Table S10, ESI†). The results indicate that electron acceptors have negligible influence on the charge transport pathway of PCLDPP. The electron mobility of PCBM is 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is greatly reduced to 1.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for SdiPBI and SdiPBI-S, respectively. The electron mobilities in blended thin films show similar trends to those in pure thin films (Table 4). The poor electron mobilities would reduce the charge transport efficiency in solar cells. In addition, we also observed unbalanced hole and electron mobilities in these cells, which would enhance the charge recombination and reduce the FF in solar cells.

The morphologies of the solar cells were analyzed by AFM images, as shown in Fig. 6. PCLDPP:PCBM thin film showed a mixed morphology with roughness of 2.82 nm. The roughness was increased to 5.60 nm and 4.56 nm when PCLDPP was blended with SdiPBI or SdiPBI-S, respectively, indicating the large phase separation in non-fullerene systems. This can be confirmed by photoluminescence (PL) measurement of pure and blended films. PCLDPP thin film produced a strong PL signature with high intensity, while PCBM and SdiPBI showed low PL (Fig. S14, ESI†). Interestingly, SdiPBI-S, with the extra thiophenes attached to SdiPBI, has strong emission around 620 nm (Fig. S14, ESI†). When PCLDPP was blended with the electron acceptor, quenching of the PL could be observed, indicating the efficient charge separation from donor to acceptor. However, the quenching ratio differed from 24.9 for PCLDPP:PCBM to 8.6 and 7.3 for SdiPBI and SdiPBI-S based cells, respectively. This illustrates that PCLDPP has a pure domain phase in blended thin films with non-fullerene acceptors,56 consistent with the large phase separation seen from AFM images. The large phase separation will reduce the efficiency of exciton diffusion into the interface of donor and acceptor, thus reducing the photocurrent and PCE.

The root mean square (RMS) roughness values of (a), (b) and (c) are 2.82 nm, 5.60 nm, and 4.56 nm, respectively. The PL quenching ratios of PCLDPP in blended films are 24.9, 8.6 and 7.3 for PCBM, SdiPBI and SdiPBI-S as the electron acceptor, respectively. 
The morphology of pure and BHJ thin films were further investigated by 2D grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (2D-GIWAXS), as shown in Fig. S15, ESI† and Fig. 7. PCLDPP pure film shows the (100) diffraction peaks located at 0.36 Å−1 both in the out-of-plane and the in-plane directions, with a d-spacing of 17.5 Å that corresponds to the length of alkyl side chains. High order (h00) and (010) diffraction peaks are not observed, indicating the lower crystallinity of PCLDPP. For SdiPBI and SdiPBI-S there are no obvious diffraction peaks, which is due to the large steric hindrance between the two PBI units. When PCLDPP was blended with PCBM, SdiPBI or SdiPBI-S, the (100) diffraction peaks for PCLDPP were very similar to that in its pure thin film, indicating that the incorporation of acceptor materials has little influence on the crystalline properties of PCLDPP, consistent with the results from SCLC measurement.

From SCLC, AFM, PL and 2D-GIWAXS measurements, we can speculate that the poor PCEs obtained using non-fullerene acceptors mainly originate from the low electron mobilities and the large phase separations with PCLDPP. In addition, SCLC measurement also reveals that PCLDPP has relatively low mobility in BHJ systems, which will induce unbalanced charge transport and reduce photocurrent and PCE in solar cells.
Therefore, it will be useful to enhance the carrier mobility and reduce the phase separation by modifying the chemical structures based on PCLDPP so as to further improve the PCE of fullerene and non-fullerene based solar cells.
Conclusions
In this work, a new conjugated small molecule containing binary electron-deficient units, DPP and PCL, was designed for fullerene and non-fullerene solar cells. The molecule was found to have a small band gap of 1.65 eV and low-lying HOMO and LUMO levels. Studies of FET devices also showed that the molecule has a reasonable hole mobility of 2.6 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. The molecule, as electron donor, was applied in organic solar cells, providing a PCE of 4.8% when using PCBM as the electron acceptor. The PCE of solar cells with non-fullerene PBI derivatives as electron acceptors could also achieve PCEs of 2.4% and 3.5%. Further investigations based on the BHJ systems of PCLDPP with different acceptors revealed that the low PCE of the non-fullerene solar cells might originate from the low mobility of the non-fullerene acceptors and the large phase separation between the donor and acceptor. Our results demonstrate that the molecules containing several electron-deficient units have great potential applications in organic solar cells.
