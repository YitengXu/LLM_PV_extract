    , Accepted 25th February 2016First published on 25th February 2016AbstractPhotoelectrodes based on solution-processed organic semiconductors are emerging as low-cost alternatives to crystalline semiconductors and platinum. In this work, the performance and stability of P3HT:PCBM\MoS3-based photocathodes are considerably improved by changing the hole-extracting layer (HEL). Oxides such as reduced graphene oxide, nickel oxide or molybdenum oxide are deposited via solution processes. With MoOx, a photocurrent density of 2 mA cm−2 during 1 h is obtained with the processing temperature lower than 150 °C – thus compatible with flexible substrates. Furthermore, we show that the performances are directly correlated with the work function of the HEL material, and the comparison with solid-state solar cells shows that efficient HELs are not the same for the two types of devices.
Introduction
A main challenge of the 21st century is to produce clean and inexpensive energy on the TW scale to face the increasing energy demand and global climate change. Solar energy is available in amounts that scale with fossil energies but its development is hindered by the low intensity and intermittence of sunlight. Efficient storage systems are thus necessary to overcome these fluctuations. Photo-electrochemical cells (PECs) allow the direct conversion of solar energy into easily storable and transportable hydrogen gas, H2. These solar-powered water splitting devices have been widely reported in the literature, both in academic journals1–3 and in patents,4 but producing hydrogen in a PEC cell on an industrial scale depends on the finding of readily available and easily processable efficient materials: presently, a wide variety of materials and configurations exist, with efficient solutions such as AlGaAs/Si/RuO2/Pt cells reaching over 18% of solar-to-chemical energy conversion5 that are not compatible with large scale production, and more cost-effective but less efficient devices based on silicon semiconductors,6–8 metal oxides9–12 or dye-sensitized solar cells.13
Solar cells based on organic semiconductors such as conducting polymers or fullerene derivatives are promising alternative materials in the field of photovoltaics, with cells reaching now 10% of power conversion efficiency (PCE)14 using lightweight materials, low-cost processes, and rapid payback time.15 The variety of OPV materials and configurations offer many possibilities for the building of PEC single photoelectrodes and full water-splitting devices. Photoelectrodes based on single polymers, e.g. poly-(3-hexylthiophene), in junction with an electrolyte provided photocurrents of a few tens of μA cm−2.16–18 In 2012, Abe and coll. built a photoelectrode with a P3HT:PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) on ITO.19 A photoanodic current (a few μA cm−2) was obtained in the presence of a sacrificial donor (a compound that is oxidized at a lower potential than water, here a thiol) in solution. In the same year, a similar device was used in aqueous NaCl, Cl− being used as a sacrificial donor.20 Tested in a two-electrode configuration (with a Pt counter electrode), an anodic current density of 100 nA cm−2 was reached.
To enhance proton reduction at the photocathode surface, a catalyst can be added at the top of the photo-active layer. As an illustration, a Pt catalyst was deposited on an evaporated small-molecule (phthalocyanine/fullerene) p/n planar junction to produce hydrogen with photocurrents in aqueous phosphoric acid (pH = 2) at 0 V vs. RHE of 800 μA cm−2 using a base-free phthalocyanine (H2Pc)21 and 1.5 mA cm−2 using a zinc phthalocyanine.22 Based on this previous work, Abe and coll. built a full water-splitting PEC device with a H2Pc/C60/Pt photocathode and a perylene/H2Pc photoanode in the water phase.23 Hydrogen was evolved from proton reduction in water but the photoanode needed a sacrificial donor. Finally, it is worth noting that a PV-biased electrosynthetic cell was reported in 2013 by Janssen and coll.24 It consisted of a triple junction polymer solar cell with an open-circuit potential (VOC) of 2.33 V, which was connected to a Pt-based electrolyzer to perform water splitting. This group recently reported an organic artificial leaf based on an encapsulated organic triple junction solar cell in direct combination with earth-abundant Co3N4/NiMoZn catalysts reaching a STH efficiency of 4.9%.25 In an earlier study,26 we investigated photocathodes based on the direct assembly of a noble metal-free catalyst with an organic photovoltaic junction for the first time. The inorganic amorphous MoS3 material was used as a catalyst for the H2 evolution reaction (HER) with 150 mV onset overpotential. By direct deposition on the organic P3HT:PCBM layer, MoS3 (mixed with TiO2) produced hydrogen at reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potential with a current density of 180 μA cm−2. The ITO\PEDOT:PSS\P3HT:PCBM\MoS3 photocathodes were not as efficient as expected for the photoproduction of hydrogen in aqueous 0.5 M H2SO4 (50 μA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE). Recently, a sol–gel TiOx electron-transporting layer (ETL) between the BHJ and a sputtered platinum catalyst interlayer was used by Haro and coll. to enhance the performance of P3HT:PCBM-based photocathodes.27 These photocathodes delivered 600 μA cm−2 at the RHE potential. Similarly, in a previous study, we used different ETLs to enhance the performance of our photocathodes.28 Among others, a photocurrent density of 8 mA cm−2 at RHE potential and a photovoltage of 0.6 V were obtained with metallic interlayers (LiF\Al\Ti) between P3HT:PCBM and MoS3. The large potential difference between the ITO\PEDOT:PSS and the LiF\Al work functions in the photocathode is probably the origin of the performance enhancement obtained with these devices. Indeed, very recently, Fumagalli and coll. reported photocathodes using the P3HT:PCBM BHJ between a MoO3 hole-transporting layer (instead of PEDOT:PSS) and a TiO2 electron-transporting layer.29 In combination with sputtered Pt, the photocathode reached more than 3 mA cm−2 at 0 V vs. RHE. From these different observations, we decided to control the energy levels of both sides of the photocathode, and investigated the hole-extraction layers (HELs), located between the ITO electrode and the P3HT:PCBM BHJ. As presented herein, with HELs having larger work functions than PEDOT:PSS, the potential difference at the H+/H2 electrolyte redox level is larger, resulting in an increase (up to 40 fold) of the photocurrent and photovoltages up to 0.6 V.
Results and discussion
As mentioned in the introduction, the first photocathodes that we reported, based on PEDOT:PSS\P3HT:PCBM and the MoS3 catalyst and tested in a three-electrode configuration (Fig. S1†), led to a photocurrent at 0 V vs. RHE of approximately 50 μA cm−2. A typical result is presented in the inset of Fig. 1 (up). PEDOT:PSS was initially not believed to be the origin of the limitation of the photocurrent and photovoltage in the photocathode configuration, because the performance of the equivalent solid-state solar cell (without MoS3, and with an evaporated LiF\Al cathode: ITO\PEDOT:PSS\P3HT:PCBM\LiF\Al) was in line with expectations (power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.0% under our conditions, with a VOC of 0.51 V and a JSC of 6.5 mA cm−2, cf. Fig. S2†). To verify this, a photocathode was built without the HEL, i.e. with the ITO\P3HT:PCBM\MoS3 architecture, and studied in 0.5 M H2SO4 under chopped illumination (Fig. 1 (up)). As shown in Fig. 1, the photocurrent density at RHE potential is much higher without PEDOT:PSS (600 μA cm−2vs. 50 μA cm−2). The onset potential (taken at 0.1 mA cm−2) is about 0.2 V vs. RHE, while that of the photocathode with PEDOT:PSS is 350 mV lower, at −0.15 V vs. RHE. The photocathode with PEDOT:PSS thus shows less performance than that without PEDOT:PSS, contrary to the equivalent solid-state solar cells: the PCE of the ITO\P3HT:PCBM\LiF\Al solar cell was only 0.60%, which was more than three times smaller than that when PEDOT:PSS is used (Fig. S2† and Table 2). Moreover, without PEDOT:PSS, the onset potential remained stable when the same voltammetric experiment was repeated, whereas the onset potential with PEDOT:PSS shifted towards more cathodic potentials, indicating a dramatic decrease in the performance. Indeed, chronoamperometry performed at the RHE potential showed (Fig. 1 (down)) a photocurrent density of 600 μA cm−2 decreasing by only 18% after 10 min. In comparison, with PEDOT:PSS, the photocurrent decreased by 50% in less than 5 min from 50 μA cm−2. Thus, the presence of PEDOT:PSS causes a decrease not only in performance but also in durability of the photocurrent.

Notably, without the PEDOT:PSS layer, the results were not always reproducible, with current densities varying greatly (±50%) between the different cells and runs. The same variation was observed in the solar cell configuration. In fact, the ITO sample was subjected to UV-ozone treatment to modify its work function and enhance the performance of solar cells30 but its transition to the glovebox resulted in air exposure, inducing a lack of control of the ITO\P3HT:PCBM interface. It is worth noting that the HEL-free photocathodes, corresponding to the worst solar cells, performed better than the photocathodes using PEDOT:PSS. Regardless of this remark, two conclusions can be drawn from the results of the voltammetry and chronoamperometry of the ITO\PEDOT:PSS\P3HT:PCBM\MoS3 and ITO\P3HT:PCBM\MoS3 photocathodes. First, the P3HT:PCBM layer is able to withstand contact with the aqueous acidic electrolyte for at least 10 minutes without the need for a protecting layer. Secondly, the limitation of the photocurrent in the ITO\PEDOT:PSS\P3HT:PCBM\MoS3 photocathodes does not arise from poor electronic transfer from the P3HT:PCBM layer to the MoS3 catalyst since the photocurrent obtained in the ITO\P3HT:PCBM\MoS3 reached significant values. For these reasons, we have considered the possibility to enhance the performance of our photocathodes by modifying the HEL between the ITO and the P3HT:PCBM layers. HELs are typically employed in organic solar cells because they help the realization of the maximum theoretical open-circuit voltage.31 Indeed, they avoid electron leakage from the direct contact between the acceptor (PCBM) and the anode, and decrease the roughness of the ITO surface. The widely used HEL PEDOT:PSS is efficient in solid-state solar cells32 but alternative HEL materials have been developed to avoid the loss of performance of solid-state OPV cells in long-term use associated with the acidity of PEDOT:PSS which causes the ITO to degrade.33
Several materials were tested as the HEL in our photocathodes. First, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) was considered. Owing to their low cost and solution processability, unique two-dimensional structure, and tunable electronic structures, GO, rGO and their derivatives have been used as a new class of efficient hole- and electron-extraction materials in polymer solar cells34–37 as reviewed by Liu and coll.38 In this work, rGO films were formed by the bubble deposition method described in a previous report.39 Nickel oxide was also tested. Pure and stoichiometric NiO is an insulator, while non-stoichiometric NiOx is a p-type semiconducting oxide.40 To avoid resistive losses, the layer must be kept thin enough, i.e. around 5–10 nm (in this work, around 7–8 nm as measured by profilometry). The third material tested was molybdenum oxide, which is an n-type semiconductor, similarly to WO3 or V2O5, which have been considered as candidates for the HEL in organic photovoltaics.41 Contrary to NiOx, these n-type materials have a conduction band close to the HOMO level of typical polymers for OPV. To avoid the evaporation process, low-temperature processes were developed to make MoOx thin films with a sol–gel precursor without forming nanoparticles before deposition.42 Herein, the MoOx precursor was spin-coated in the glovebox and annealed at 150 °C in air. On top of these four different HELs, P3HT:PCBM was then deposited by spin-coating on the ITO\HEL substrates, and MoS3 by spraying, completing the fabrication of the photocathodes. For OPV cells, instead of the catalyst, lithium fluoride and aluminum were successively deposited by evaporation on the ITO\HEL\P3HT:PCBM stack.

Fig. 2 shows the voltammograms of the ITO\HEL\P3HT:PCBM\MoS3 photocathodes. For all of them, a photocurrent was present and increased when the potential is swept negatively. The negligible dark current, obtained even at potentials where MoS3 is electrocatalytically active, is due to the diode behaviour of the photovoltaic junction. The performance of the photocathodes depended on the material used as the HEL. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics extracted from the voltammograms: the onset potential (E0.1 mA cm−2), the onset photovoltage (Vphoto, 0.1 mA cm−2), which is the difference between the onset potential of the photocathode and the onset potential of the catalyst alone (cf. Fig. S3†), the current density taken at 0 V vs. RHE, and the power-saved figure-of-merit Φsaved,NPAC (cf.ref. 43 and ESI† for details). The power-saved metric relative to a non-photoactive dark electrode with an identical catalyst and measured in an identical three-electrode electrochemical cell is called Φsaved,NPAC (NPAC = non-photoactive, identical catalyst) and calculated as follows:  where ηF is the faradaic efficiency assumed to be 100%, Pin is the power of the incident illumination, and Jphoto,m and Vphoto,m are the photocurrent and photovoltage at the maximum power point. Jphoto is obtained by calculating the difference between the current under illumination for a photocathode (Jlight) and the current of the corresponding catalyst (Jdark). The photovoltage Vphoto is the difference between the potential applied to the photocathode under illumination (Ulight) and the potential applied to the catalyst electrode (Udark) to obtain the same current density. The subscript “m” stands for “maximum”.

Table 1 shows that PEDOT:PSS and MoOx are the least and most efficient HELs, respectively. The photocurrent density at 0 V vs. RHE increased from 50 μA cm−2 (PEDOT:PSS) to 2.2 mA cm−2 (MoOx), with intermediate values (0.7 mA cm−2 for rGO and 1.3 mA cm−2 for NiOx). Moreover, the onset potential (and therefore the onset photovoltage) increased from less than 0.1 V (PEDOT:PSS) to 0.56 V (MoOx), with values of 0.35 V with rGO and 0.49 V with NiOx. Comparable performances were obtained with the rGO-based photocathode and the HEL-free photocathode, though working rGO-based photocathodes were obtained with a higher success rate. It can also be noted that the performance of the PEDOT:PSS-based photocathode is much smaller than that of the rGO-, NiOx- and MoOx-based photocathodes. Indeed, the power-saved metric was 0.007% using PEDOT:PSS and 0.11%, 0.24% and 0.47% using rGO, NiOx and MoOx respectively.
A similar study was performed on solid state solar cells (Table 2 and Fig. S2†). Except for PEDOT:PSS that showed higher performance in solar cells as mentioned above, the same trend as with photocathodes was observed, with PCE equal to 1.97%, 0.88%, 1.38% and 2.31% using PEDOT:PSS, rGO, NiOx and MoOx, respectively. In addition, except for PEDOT:PSS, all the characteristics (VOC, JSC, and FF) increased, similar to the characteristics of the corresponding photocathodes. Concordant values regarding the VOC (solar cells) and onset photovoltages (photocathodes) were obtained, but the photocurrent densities were smaller in the photocathode configuration compared to the solar cells (for example, with the MoOx HEL, 2.2 mA cm−2vs. 7.8 mA cm−2). This phenomenon is explained by the fact that the charge transfer at the BHJ/electrolyte interface is a rate-limiting process, contrary to the BHJ/metal interface in solar cells.21,44 In the following section, the origin of the particularly low response of the PEDOT:PSS-based photocathode is discussed.

Discussion
To understand the performance of the photocathodes obtained with the different HELs, energy band diagrams have been drawn based on values taken from the literature. Fig. 3 presents the energy band diagrams of an ITO\PEDOT:PSS\P3HT:PCBM\MoS3 photocathode (up) in contact with an acidic electrolyte and of an ITO\PEDOT:PSS\P3HT:PCBM\LiF\Al solid-state solar cell (down). Photogenerated electrons are injected into the LiF\Al cathode in the case of an organic solid-state solar cell (ITO\PEDOT:PSS\P3HT:PCBM\LiF\Al), and in the electrolyte in the case of the photocathode. Because the MoS3 layer consists of a porous layer of nanoparticle aggregates, we assumed that the MoS3 nanoparticles adopt the Fermi level of the electrolyte, an assumption that is similar to the one made in the case of a silicon-based photocathode using Pt nanoparticles as the catalyst.45 The work function of Al has been taken as 4.1 eV,46 though its modification by LiF decreases the value to <4.1 eV,47 and the work function of PEDOT:PSS has been taken as ∼4.9–5.2 eV.48–51
 Fig. 3  Energy band diagram of an ITO\PEDOT:PSS\P3HT:PCBM\MoS3\\H+/H2 photocathode (up) and of the corresponding ITO\PEDOT:PSS\P3HT:PCBM\LiF\Al solar cell (down). The diagram of the P3HT:PCBM BHJ is simplified as if it was a bilayer, with HOMO and LUMO levels positioned at their level in the dark. The BHJ is located between an anodic side (ITO with a HEL) and a cathodic side (metallic electrode or an electrolyte). 
It can be noticed that the difference between the ITO\PEDOT:PSS\P3HT:PCBM\MoS3 photocathode and the ITO\PEDOT:PSS\P3HT:PCBM\LiF\Al solar cell is the energy level of the cathodic side of the device (H+/H2 Fermi level for the photocathode, LiF\Al Fermi level for the solar cell). This induces a different Fermi level difference between the HEL side (PEDOT:PSS) and the cathodic side. In the case of the photocathode, this Fermi level difference is relatively small (0.5 eV) compared to that in the solar cell (0.9 eV).
In bulk heterojunctions – contrary to standard bilayer heterojunctions in which the donor and acceptor phases form selective contacts to the anode and the cathode – the two phases are intimately mixed: there is no preferred direction for the internal field, and the electrons and holes created within the volume have no net resulting direction in which to move. Therefore, a symmetry breaking configuration is essential to orientate charge transport and decrease the charge recombination. A negligible photovoltaic effect is observed if the electrodes at the two sides of the bulk heterojunction have the same work functions, while different interfacial layers have been reported to determine the polarity of the device by creating an electrical field between the two electrodes.52
In the solid-state solar cell shown in Fig. 3 (down), the potential difference between the two sides seems to be sufficient for the photovoltaic effect to occur. However, the work function difference in the photocathode (Fig. 3 (up)) is smaller and the resulting electric field is too low to drive the charges towards the appropriate electrodes.
In contrast, the work function values of rGO (4.9–5.4 eV,53,54 depending on the oxygen content), NiOx (5.1–5.5 eV55,56) and MoOx (6.0–6.8 eV57–61 for solution-processed films) are higher than that of PEDOT:PSS. In the case of the photocathode, the work function difference between the HEL and the electrolyte is ∼0.7 eV with rGO, ∼0.9 eV with NiOx and ∼1.7 eV with MoOx, in any case, larger than the photocathode with PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 4). The work function difference between the HEL and the electrolyte increases with the increase of the work function of the HEL. This results in a larger electric field inside the photocathode that further improves the performances. In contrast, in the solid-state solar cell, the work function difference is always sufficient for the photovoltaic effect to occur even when PEDOT:PSS is used, and the higher performance obtained with PEDOT:PSS compared to NiOx and rGO could come from the better hole-extracting properties.
 Fig. 4  Energy band diagram of an ITO\HEL\P3HT:PCBM\MoS3\\H+/H2 photocathode with different HELs (PEDOT:PSS, rGO, NiOx, and MoOx). 
This observation is in agreement with the conclusions of Abe and coll.,21 who showed that the photophysical events within their small-molecule-based organic photocathode (i.e., visible-light absorption, carrier generation at the p/n interface, conduction of electrons and holes in each layer) were the same as those in the corresponding solid-state photovoltaic cell, though the charge transfer rates are different at the organic semiconductor/metallic electrode interface (in a solar cell) and at the solid/liquid interface (in a photoelectrode), as mentioned earlier. In fact, the rate-limiting nature of this charge transfer explains the need for an electrocatalyst.
To sum up the results obtained in Fig. 3, Fig. 5 presents the Φsaved,NPAC figure-of-merit plotted against the work functions of the materials used as the HEL. Φsaved,NPAC has the advantage of taking into account both the photovoltage and the photocurrent produced by the photocathode.43 The figure shows that the efficiency of the light-harvesting module is evolving linearly with the work function of the HEL, and clearly indicates that the work function of the HEL is a key parameter to further improve the performances.

Stability

Fig. 6 presents chronoamperometric experiments carried out at 0 V vs. RHE. With PEDOT:PSS, the photocurrent density was low from the beginning (around 20 μA cm−2, cf. Fig. S4† with adapted vertical axis) and decreased rapidly (Fig. 6a). With rGO, the photocurrent density at RHE potential was stable for 1 h at 0.7 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6b). Using NiOx, the photocurrent actually increased, and stabilized at 1 mA cm−2 after 30 min (Fig. 6c). Finally, with MoOx, the photocurrent density at RHE potential started at more than 2 mA cm−2 and decreased by only 20% after 1 hour (Fig. 6d). This HEL thus combines best performance and better stability.

Conclusions
The introduction of oxides as the HEL into photocathodes based on P3HT:PCBM solar cells and a noble metal-free catalyst, MoS3, increased dramatically their performance compared to the use of PEDOT:PSS. Photocurrent densities of about 2 mA cm−2 were obtained for 1 hour with MoOx, the HEL material with the largest work function.
Interestingly, the performance seems to be directly related to the work function of the HEL; the largest work function of the HEL led to the highest onset photovoltage and photocurrent density. This can be explained by the larger potential difference between the Fermi levels of the HEL and the electrolyte, which supports the migration of the charges towards their respective electrodes, and limits recombination. These results are in agreement with a very recent study published by Fumagalli and coll.,29 though we show here that the ETL is not compulsory from an energetic point of view, provided that the electrolyte has the right energy level. Importantly, the fabrication of the device could be carried out with low cost materials, from solution and at temperatures never going over 150 °C. The proposed strategy is thus compatible with large scale production on flexible substrates without the use of noble metals or vacuum processes. Overall, these promising results show how improvement of the performances of photocathode is possible through the rational selection of interfacial layers, catalysts and organic semiconductor materials.

All manipulations were carried out under an Ar atmosphere in a glovebox unless otherwise mentioned. PEDOT:PSS (AI 4083 for spin-coated devices) and P3HT (M104, RR = 96.3%) were purchased from Ossila, and PC60BM from Solenn BV. ITO-coated glass substrates (XY20s) were purchased from Xinyan Technology Ltd. The MoS3 nanoparticle suspension62 was prepared according to the literature and is detailed in the ESI file.† Any other reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used without supplementary purification.
Fabrication of the photocathodes and the solar cells

PEDOT:PSS. 
On the cleaned ITO-coated glass substrate (cf. ESI†), PEDOT:PSS was filtered with a PVDF filter (0.45 μm) and spin-coated in air (speed: 3000 rpm/ramp: 5 s/dwelling time: 30 s followed by 5000 rpm/5 s/30 s), resulting in a 40 nm thick layer. After thermal treatment in air for 10 minutes at 150 °C, the substrate was quickly transferred in an Ar-filled glovebox.


Reduced graphene oxide. 
First, graphene oxide (GO) was prepared using the standard Hummers63,64 method followed by spontaneous exfoliation in water using successive centrifugation steps. The GO film was formed through the bubble deposition method, which is described in a previous report.39 Substrates with deposited GO were dried in a nitrogen flow and thermally annealed under high vacuum at 350 °C for 90 min to give rGO.


Nickel oxide. 
The NiOx films were prepared using a NiOx precursor, which was synthesized according to a reported procedure.40 Briefly, nickel acetate (1.245 g, 5 mmol, 1.00 eq.) was dissolved in absolute ethanol (50 mL) with monoethanolamine (305 mg, 5 mmol, 1.00 eq.). The solution was stirred for 4 h in a closed vial at 70 °C until complete dissolution. Prior to deposition, the precursor was diluted 4 times in absolute ethanol. It was then spin-coated at 4000/5/90 in air. The substrates were annealed at 320 °C in air for 45 min, and then submitted to UV-ozone treatment for 15 min.


Molybdenum oxide. 
The MoOx precursor was prepared by dissolving molybdenum tricarbonyl trispropionitrile [Mo(CO)3(EtCN)3] in acetonitrile at a concentration of 0.05 M.42 The solution was stirred for 24 h in a closed vial in the glovebox. Using a PVDF filter (0.45 μm) on a syringe, the precursor was deposited by spin-coating in the glovebox at 5000/5/60. The samples were annealed in air at 150 °C for 20 min.


P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction. 
A P3HT:PCBM solution was prepared by dissolving 25 mg of P3HT and 25 mg of PC60BM in 1 mL of anhydrous ortho-dichlorobenzene in the glovebox. The solution was stirred at 55 °C for 2 hours and then at room temperature overnight. The P3HT:PCBM blend was filtered with a 0.45 μm PVDF filter and spin-coated on top of the HEL (1500 rpm/5 s/60 s). The thickness of the P3HT:PCBM layer was 170 ± 10 nm.


Catalyst deposition. 
As a last step to fabricate the photocathode, the MoS3 suspension (cf. ESI†) was then sprayed onto the substrate heated at 85 °C in air. The photocathodes were transferred back into the glovebox and annealed at 140 °C for 20 min.


Cathode evaporation. 
For the characterization of organic solar cells, the substrates (ITO\HEL\P3HT:PCBM) were annealed for 5 min at 140 °C in the glovebox and then 1.2 nm of LiF followed by 100 nm of Al were deposited under vacuum in a joule evaporator.

Electro- and photoelectro-chemical characterization
Electrochemical measurements were recorded by using a BioLogic Model VSP 0254 potentiostat. A three-electrode configuration was used. For polarization and electrolysis measurements, a glassy carbon plate was used as the auxiliary electrode and an Ag/AgCl (KCl 3.5 M) electrode was used as the reference electrode. Potentials are quoted against the reversible hydrogen electrode. In photocatalytic tests, the photocathode was not plunged into the electrolyte (0.5 M H2SO4) only the MoS3 side was put against it thanks to a rubber seal with a hole corresponding to the electrochemical area (0.28 cm2). The glass\ITO side was illuminated with a lamp, as presented in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† An opaque mask with a hole (area 0.28 cm2) was placed behind the photocathode to ensure that the electrochemical area and the illuminated area of the photovoltaic part were the same. The samples were illuminated with a 200 W mercury–xenon lamp (Oriel, ozone free) operating at 106 W coupled with a spectra-physics 59472 UV cut-off filter (λ > 400 nm). Irradiance at the substrate surface was measured to be approximately 100 mW cm−2 thanks to a Coherent PowerMax-USB PM150-50C Power Sensor.
Other methods of characterization
The current–voltage characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2635 system Source Meter under a nitrogen atmosphere. Solar cell performances were characterized under various light intensities of AM 1.5 illumination with an Atlas Solar Constant 575PV simulator. The sample was illuminated through the glass substrate.
