    , Accepted 11th December 2019First published on 11th December 2019AbstractRecent research studies have shown that the halogenated benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT) unit as a polymer donor exhibits high charge carrier mobility due to the well-ordered molecular packing and high crystallinity, which is meaningful for achieving highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs). However, it is difficult to acquire the accurate packing information of polymer materials. Herein, we investigated the self-assembled behaviors of two DTBDT derivatives, 4,8-bis(4-octadecylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (H-DTBDT) and 4,8-bis(5-bromo-4-octadecylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (Br-DTBDT), to elucidate the effect of introducing a bromine atom on molecular packing structures by STM at the 1-phenyloctane/HOPG interface. It is observed that the H-DTBDT molecules exhibit a random arrangement along each lamella, while the Br-DTBDT molecules self-assemble into a highly ordered lamellar structure. Density functional theory (DFT) analysis combined with the topological properties of the electron density at the bond critical points revealed that the existence of weak intermolecular interactions of Br⋯S facilitates the regular packing motif of Br-DTBDT molecules. The results helped us to understand that the Br⋯S bond generally acted as the auxiliary force and can play the primary role in the construction of supramolecular nanostructures.
Introduction
Since the first report by Yang et al. that found that the polymer based on dithienobenzodithiophene (DTBDT) yielded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5% in 2010, DTBDT has received considerable attention as a promising donor material in organic solar cells (OSCs), due to their fine-tuned band gaps and high charge carrier mobility.1,2 Over the past few years, side chain engineering has been a general method for downshifting the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and improving open-circuit voltage (Voc) by tuning the length of alkyl chain, introducing branched side chains and so on.3,4 Alternatively, introducing halogen atoms on the side conjugated groups also plays a significant role in designing low bandgap and high carrier mobility materials due to their strong electron-withdrawing ability.5,6 Encouragingly, novel polymer materials composed of halogenated DTBDT have boosted the PCE up to 13.1–16.5% for single-junction solar cells.7–9 Some studies also revealed that the introduction of fluorine or chlorine into DTBDT can improve the order of molecular packing and elevate crystallinity as well as create a deep HOMO level.6,10,11 Thus, a better grasp of how the introduction of a halogen atom impacts the structure can aid in the molecular design for high performance organic semiconducting materials.
Non-covalent interactions have been demonstrated as the driving forces for more ordered molecular stacking with high carrier mobility, such as the hydrogen bond,12 chalcogen bond,13,14 and halogen bond.5,6,15 Owing to the anisotropic charge distribution, halogen atoms exhibit a locally electrostatic potential positive cap (σ-hole) and a ring-like electrostatic potential negative region, leading to the higher specificity and directionality of the halogen bond. In addition, surface self-assembly plays a crucial role in the study and comprehension of non-covalent interaction using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) as the visualization tool. However, the intermolecular interactions and packing structure are difficult to understand as a result of the molecular weight variations and dispersity of polymer materials. In contrast to polymer materials, the well-defined chemical structure of small molecules is beneficial for investigating the effects of weak interactions on the packing structure. In the past few years, many attempts, especially for halogenated thiophene-based conjugated molecules, have been made to understand the non-covalent interactions between bromine and halogen bond acceptors. For instance, Perepichka et al. reported that halogen bonds (Br⋯Br and Br⋯S) cooperate with the hydrogen bond (Br⋯H) to stabilize the self-assembled structures of 2,5,9,12-tetrabromoanthra[1,2-b:4,3-b′:5,6-b′′:8,7-b′′′] tetrathiophene.16,17 Wu et al. indicated that although the Br⋯Br halogen bond stabilizes 2D porous supramolecular networks of 3,10-dibromo-perylo[1,12b,c,d] thiophene, the Br⋯S interaction is also indispensable.18 Our previous works have proved that the molecular arrangements of thienophenanthrene derivatives are mainly stabilized by Br⋯OC and Br⋯S interaction. However, Br⋯OC interaction is stronger and decisive for the ordered self-assembly.19,20 In the previous reports, the Br⋯S bond has been observed, however, Br⋯S interactions only serve as a subsidiary force for the self-assembly compared with the stronger Br⋯Br, Br⋯OC and Br⋯H interactions.16–20 Hence, very little attention has been paid to the weak Br⋯S interactions. Self-assembly nanoarchitectures dominated by Br⋯S interaction have barely been reported, which could be an invaluable addition in the field of 2D supramolecular self-assembly.
Herein, we perform a comparative study of two DTBDT derivatives, 4,8-bis(4-octadecylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (H-DTBDT) and 4,8-bis(5-bromo-4-octadecylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (Br-DTBDT), to elucidate the influences of the bromine group on the self-assembly behaviour at the 1-phenyloctane/highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) interface, as shown in Fig. 1a and b. The chemical structures, HOMOs, and calculated electrostatic potential maps (ESP) for H-DTBDT and Br-DTBDT are presented in Fig. 1. STM experiments reveal that Br-DTBDT molecules form more ordered monolayers than H-DTBDT on the HOPG surface. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations deliver a reasonable explanation that Br⋯S interactions are vital for the highly ordered self-assembled architectures of Br-DTBDT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation that except for van der Waals forces, electrostatically driven Br⋯S interactions dominate the well-ordered 2D self-assembly.

Experimental section
The compounds H-DTBDT and Br-DTBDT were prepared based on the reported literature.10,21 Nonpolar solvent 1-phenyloctane was purchased from Tokyo Chemistry Industry (TCI) and used without further purification. H-DTBDT and Br-DTBDT were dissolved in 1-phenyloctane at room temperature to prepare a saturated solution (concentration: 2.6 × 10−5 M and 8.1 × 10−6 M, respectively). After obtaining atomic resolution images of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG, grade ZYB, Bruker, USA), STM measurements were conducted by applying a drop of the saturated solution onto the surface of HOPG in the constant current mode using a Nanoscope IIIa Multimode SPM (Bruker, USA) at room-temperature. The experimental conditions are given in the corresponding figure captions. The geometric parameters of self-assembled structures were acquired from the high-resolution STM images using NanoScope analysis software. To confirm the reproducibility of the STM results, different tips and samples were used. The unit cell parameters were obtained through manual measurement of STM images for several times from different high-resolution STM images after performing the drift correction on them using SPIP software, and then the mean value and standard deviation were calculated. The molecular models were built by Material Studio 7.0 based on the high-resolution STM imaging of the samples.
Density functional theory calculations were performed by the Gaussian 09 program package. The M06-2X functional with the polarized 6-31+G(d) basis set was applied for molecular geometry optimization and torsional energy, which has been validated to provide a more accurate description of the energies of halogen-bonded systems.22 The basis set superposition error (BSSE) was considered for correcting interaction energy, which arises from the approximation of using a limited number of mathematical functions to describe the atomic orbitals and the supermolecule formation by a multimer.23,24 The topological properties of electron densities, ESP and the frontier molecular orbital were calculated by the Multiwfn program25 and visualized with the VMD program.26
Results and discussion
Adsorption conformation
Generally, a rigid aromatic core flatly adsorbs on the substrate along with maximizing adsorbate–substrate interactions.27–29 Moreover, it has been confirmed that the planar adsorption of the molecule exhibits a high electron tunnelling reflected by tunnelling-spectroscopy measurements, which is conducive to investigating the molecular conformations and the intermolecular interactions.30,31 DTDBT is composed of benzodithiophene (BDT) and two thiophenes, which are linked by a rotational single bond. So, it is necessary to take the relationship between molecular configuration and energy into consideration. The inter-ring twisting potential of H-DTDBT and Br-DTBDT as a function of the dihedral angle has been examined by DFT calculations at the M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level. The comparison of the curves for compounds H-DTDBT and Br-DTBDT (Fig. 2) shows that the introduction of bromine hardly affects the torsion potential of the conjugate core, and the most stable conformations for the two compounds are nonplanar with dihedral angles of θ = 57.3° and θ = 57.8°, respectively. On the other hand, the planar conformation for θ = 0 is more stable than the conformation with θ = 180° due to the stronger steric repulsion of S–S. In order to flatly adsorb on the substrate considering the influence of the substrate, the DTBDT backbone overcomes a steric repulsion (2 × 52.7 kJ mol−1 for H-DTBDT, 2 × 51.5 kJ mol−1 for Br-DTBDT). However, the adsorption energy gained from the alkyl chains fully adsorbing on the graphite substrate is 2 × 97.9 kJ mol−1 (approximately 5.4 kcal mol−1 per CH2), which is almost twice that of the steric repulsion.32 In addition, the planar adsorption of the conjugated core also contributes to the adsorption energy and improves the stability. Therefore, we reasonably deduce that both Br-DTBDT and H-DTDBT flatly adsorb on the substrate with dihedral angles of θ = 0.

Self-assembly of H-DTBDT at the 1-phenyloctane/HOPG interface
First of all, the H-DTBDT molecules were deposited on the HOPG surface at room temperature. Large-scale STM images of the assembled monolayer absorption structure of H-DTBDT molecules are shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S1a (ESI†). The molecules form a linear pattern, which is composed of alternating equidistant linear bright stripes and dark troughs. The bright region corresponds to the high electron density of H-DTBDT backbones, and the dark areas correspond to the interdigitated alkyl chains. The width of the dark trough was measured to be 2.1 ± 0.1 nm, which is in good agreement with the theoretical value of the alkyl chain length, 2.2 nm (Fig. 3b). Unlike the generally assembled structure exhibiting a high degree of order within the same domain,33–35 the DTBDT backbone is composed of a straight line and randomly distributed curve highlighted by canary yellow in Fig. 3a.
 Fig. 3  (a) Large-scale STM image of an adlayer formed by H-DTBDT molecules at the 1-phenyloctane/graphite interface (tunneling parameters: Iset = 510 pA, Vbias = 630 mV; scale bar: 120 × 120 nm2). (b) Monomolecular model of H-DTBDT. The measured lengths of alkyl chain and backbone were 2.2 nm and 1.1 nm, respectively. 
The self-assembled adlayer composed of the ordered straight linear nanostructure is presented in Fig. 4a, which reveals that the H-DTBDT molecules adopt the same packing manner between the adjacent bright stripes due to the interdigitating of the side chains. However, the high-resolution STM (Fig. 4b) image suggests that the arrangement of molecules is disordered along the bright stripes. Despite the irregularity of the molecular packing, a recurring trimer has been observed indicated by the three red ovals shown in Fig. 4b. The bright spots on the two side molecules correspond to the spatial distribution of the molecular HOMO, which reveals that the two side molecules are flatly adsorbed on the substrate. Note that the central molecule of the trimer is visually narrower compared with the neighboring two molecules, which means the central molecule is slightly inclined with respect to the substrate. Although the analysis of adsorption conformation suggests that the H-DTDBT molecule tends to flatly adsorb on the HOPG surface, the dense packing of the side chains leads to the obliquity of the central molecule and the formation of the trimer. The proposed model for the trimer in Fig. 4c shows that each lateral molecule forms a closely contacted alkyl chain pair and a void accommodating the closely contacted alkyl chain pair with the central molecule, so that the interdigitating motif of the alkyl chains for the trimers is ‘2 + 1’ between the bright stripes.

(c) Proposed structural models for the trimer, where the oblique H-DTBDT molecules are indicated in blue. (d–f) The proposed structural models for direct- and indirect-contacted trimers, based on the high-resolution STM image. Note that the red arrow represents the positive dislocation of the trimer. Purple and yellow arrows correspond to the negative dislocation mode and the dislocation-free mode, respectively. (g) Large-scale STM image of H-DTBDT self-assembled into the curve pattern at the 1-phenyloctane/HOPG interface (Iset = 500 pA, Vbias = 650 mV; 60 × 60 nm2). (h and i) Tentative structural model for the molecular packing along the blue dotted line. Note that the molecules in blue and red rectangles contact in continuous co-directional dislocation. 
Along the bright stripes, the trimers either directly or indirectly contact to arrange into the straight linear structure, as shown by the different color rounded rectangles indicated in Fig. 4b. Based on the STM images of H-DTBDT, the proposed model for direct-contacted trimers is presented in Fig. 4f and two possible models for indirect-contacted trimers are presented in Fig. 4d and e, respectively. For the convenience of analyzing the molecular packing, the geometrical centers of green molecules are linked by arrows. The arrows are highlighted in three colors (red, purple, yellow). The red arrow within the trimer means that two lateral molecules of the trimer are parallel to each other and contact with the central molecule to form a positive dislocation. The purple and yellow arrows reveal that there are two kinds of molecular contact modes between the direct-contacted molecules indicated in green. The purple arrow represents the negative dislocation mode and the yellow arrow means the dislocation-free mode.
Based on the models in Fig. 4, it is concluded that the straight linear structure results from the alternate arrangement of the positive dislocation (trimer), negative dislocation mode and dislocation-free mode. For instance, Fig. 4d shows that the contact mode between the middle molecules is a dislocation-free mode highlighted by yellow arrows, but the molecules in contact with the trimers (positive dislocation) in the negative dislocation mode are highlighted by purple arrows. In addition, the molecular packing suggests that the van der Waals forces mainly originating from the interdigitated alkyl chains stabilize the monolayer.

Fig. 4g shows the large-scale STM image containing the curvilinear self-assembled structure highlighted in canary yellow. The proposed model for the molecular arrangement indicated by a blue dashed line has been built, which is divided into two parts presented in Fig. 4h and i, respectively. Fig. 4h shows that four planar adsorption and three oblique adsorption molecules form three trimers, and these seven molecules contact in the positive dislocation (blue rectangle shown in Fig. 4h). The continuous positive dislocation contacts result in the occurrence of the ‘uphill’. Fig. 4i shows that there are five negative dislocation contacts and three dislocation-free contacts between nine H-DTBDT molecules (red rectangle shown in Fig. 4i), which contributes to the occurrence of the ‘downhill’. Comparing with the molecular arrangement in the straight linear self-assembled structure, it is found that the curvilinear structure results from the continuous co-directional dislocation. The analysis of the self-assembly of H-DTBDT at the 1-phenyloctane/HOPG interface reveals that the interdigitated alkyl chains maximize the intermolecular van der Waals interactions leading to the alternate arrangement of bright H-DTBDT backbone stripes and dark chain troughs. However, due to the lack of the directional weak interaction between the conjugated cores, the arrangement of the molecules within a bright stripe is irregular.
Self-assembly of Br-DTBDT at the 1-phenyloctane/HOPG interface

Fig. 5a and Fig. S1b (ESI†) show the large-scale STM images of the adlayer formed by Br-DTBDT at the 1-phenyloctane/HOPG interface. It is evident that the Br-DTBDT molecules assemble into a more highly ordered lamellar feature compared with H-DTBDT. Two-dimensional fast Fourier transform for the high-resolution images of H-DTBDT (Fig. 4b) and Br-DTBDT (Fig. 5b) has been applied, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†).41 The more orderly lattice structure of Br-DTBDT (Fig. S2b, ESI†) offers further proof that Br-DTBDT forms a long-range ordered self-assembled structure. More details about the internal structure and the orientation of Br-DTBDT are revealed in the representative high-resolution STM image (Fig. 5b). The bright spots correspond to the planar adsorption of the Br-DTBDT backbone and they are separated by dark troughs that arise from the fully extended interdigitated alkyl chains. According to the self-assembled structure, the unit cell parameters are a = 3.7 ± 0.1 nm, b = 1.3 ± 0.1 nm, and γ = 65° ± 1°. Each unit cell contains one Br-DTBDT molecule, and the calculated area density is 4.36 nm2 per molecule. The molecular packing model of Br-DTBDT is presented in Fig. 5c. The model implies that except for the molecule–molecule and molecule–substrate van der Waals forces, the formation of intermolecular Br⋯S bonds between neighboring molecules is the dominant factor for the well-ordered 2D self-assembly (inset in Fig. 5c). As the ESP map shows in Fig. 1d, the charge distribution of the electropositive cap (marked in blue) of the Br atoms, referred to as the σ-hole, and the electronegative area of sulfur atoms (marked in red) provide the possibility for the electrostatic attraction between Br and S atoms.

(c) Proposed molecular model of the linear structure. Inset shows the intermolecular interactions. 
To gain deeper insight into the intermolecular binding mechanism, the dimer of the Br-DTBDT molecules was analyzed by DFT calculations. The theoretical calculation reveals that the C–Br–S angle is 174.3°, and the Br⋯S bond is 3.35 Å in length, which is shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radius of 3.65 Å. In addition, the counterpoise corrected binding energy of the dimer is −6.53 kJ mol−1. The calculation indicates that the Br⋯S bond is a relatively weak intermolecular interaction consistent with the preceding reports.16,18,20,36,37 Furthermore, the nature and the strength of the Br⋯S interaction were analyzed by the Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules method (QTAIM) performed with the Multiwfn program, which is available for topology analysis to validate the existence of a critical point (CP).38–40 In topology analysis of the electron density distribution, the points (3, −1) generally appear between the attractive atom pairs and are defined as a bond critical point (BCP). Table 1 tabulates the topological values of the Br⋯S bond, which associate with the BCP (Fig. S3a, ESI†). In general, the electron density (ρBCP) and the potential electron energy density (VBCP) are good indexes of the non-covalent bond strength. Namely, the strength of a weak interaction is a positive correlation with the ρBCP and VBCP. Laplacian of electron density (∇2ρBCP) value illustrates the concentration or depletion of a local electron density at a given point. Herein, ∇2ρBCP > 0 means a weak closed-shell interaction. In addition, the ratio of potential energy density and kinetic energy (|VBCP|/GBCP = 0.73) and energy density (HBCP > 0) also confirms that the Br⋯S interaction is a closed-shell noncovalent interaction.38 For better understanding and visualizing the charge rearrangement due to the formation of the Br⋯S bond, the deformation electron density map is displayed in Fig. S3b (ESI†). The map depicts the aspherical distribution of electron density around the bromine atom. And the electronic-depleted area of the Br, the σ-hole, faces towards the electron-concentrated area over the sulfur atom, facilitating the formation of the Br⋯S electrostatic interaction. Overall, we conclude that Br⋯S interactions play a crucial role in the formation of a highly ordered self-assembled structure for Br-DTBDT based on the STM images and the theoretical calculations.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that the introduction of bromine atoms into DTBDT improves the order degree of the self-assembly structure by investigation using a combination of STM and DFT calculations. For H-DTBDT, the self-assembly exhibits an alternating structure of bright stripes and dark troughs. Along the bright stripes, three types of randomly arranged dislocations (the positive dislocation for trimer, negative dislocation mode and dislocation-free mode) have been observed due to the lack of directional intermolecular interactions. The alternate arrangement of the different dislocations results in the straight linear structure. The continuous co-directional dislocations lead to the curvilinear structure. For Br-DTBDT, the molecules arrange into a highly ordered linear monolayer. In conjunction with theoretical calculations and the comparative study for the surface self-assembly of H-DTBDT and Br-DTBDT, we demonstrated that the formation of the directional Br⋯S interactions between the conjugated cores is the dominating factor for the fabrication of a well-ordered self-assembled structure. The results provide direct evidence that the intermolecular Br⋯S bond as a common weak interaction plays an important role in controlling the supramolecular structures. We believe that it will be meaningful in the construction of functional supramolecular materials, biomaterials and high-performance organic semiconductors via rational design of the assembling precursors.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a and b) The molecular structures and corresponding HOMOs of H-DTBDT and Br-DTBDT. (c and d) Calculated molecular electrostatic potential distribution (ESP) of H-DTBDT and Br-DTBDT under vacuum. The map colour scales from −20.92 kJ mol−1 (red) to +20.92 kJ mol−1 (blue). Note that the alkyl side chains are replaced by the methyl groups for brevity.	 

 	Fig. 2  The calculated inter-ring twisting potentials of H-DTDBT and Br-DTBDT at the M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Large-scale STM image of an adlayer formed by H-DTBDT molecules at the 1-phenyloctane/graphite interface (tunneling parameters: Iset = 510 pA, Vbias = 630 mV; scale bar: 120 × 120 nm2). (b) Monomolecular model of H-DTBDT. The measured lengths of alkyl chain and backbone were 2.2 nm and 1.1 nm, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Large-scale and (b) high-resolution STM images of H-DTBDT self-assembled into the straight linear pattern at the 1-phenyloctane/HOPG interface (Iset = 500 pA, Vbias = 650 mV; scale bar: (a) 60 × 60 nm2, (b) 20 × 20 nm2). (c) Proposed structural models for the trimer, where the oblique H-DTBDT molecules are indicated in blue. (d–f) The proposed structural models for direct- and indirect-contacted trimers, based on the high-resolution STM image. Note that the red arrow represents the positive dislocation of the trimer. Purple and yellow arrows correspond to the negative dislocation mode and the dislocation-free mode, respectively. (g) Large-scale STM image of H-DTBDT self-assembled into the curve pattern at the 1-phenyloctane/HOPG interface (Iset = 500 pA, Vbias = 650 mV; 60 × 60 nm2). (h and i) Tentative structural model for the molecular packing along the blue dotted line. Note that the molecules in blue and red rectangles contact in continuous co-directional dislocation.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Large-scale and (b) high-resolution STM images of the adlayer formed by Br-DTBDT at the 1-phenyloctane/HOPG interface (Iset = 520 pA, Vbias = 600 mV; scale bar: (a) 100 × 100 nm2, (b) 20 × 20 nm2). (c) Proposed molecular model of the linear structure. Inset shows the intermolecular interactions.
