    , Accepted 14th February 2019First published on 16th February 2019AbstractTo achieve highly efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting, great efforts have been dedicated to develop various photoelectrode materials in pure water electrolytes. Recently, some studies are turning to hydrogen production from seawater or wastewater, to save valuable freshwater resources and make waste profitable. Here, we fabricate one-dimensional SnO2@BiVO4 core–shell nanorod arrays decorated with cobalt-phosphate cocatalyst (1D SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi NRAs), which show efficient charge separation and transport properties due to the rational design of conducting core-layer and introduction of the cocatalyst. The as-obtained SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanodes exhibit largely enhanced PEC water oxidation performance: the maximum photocurrent density of 2.63 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE is 6.58 times higher than that of pristine BiVO4 films (∼0.40 mA cm−2). Moreover, the ternary photoanode exhibits promising PEC performance for urea oxidation, giving rise to a current density of 3.44 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE in a neutral urea electrolyte. This work presents a sunlight-driven, eco-friendly and sustainable method to produce hydrogen and simultaneously treat urea-rich wastewater.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen, as a regenerative and eco-friendly fuel, has received a great deal of attention in the past decades because of its large potential in replacing conventional fossil fuels.1–4 Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting into H2 and O2 using sunlight has been regarded as one of the most promising routes for the green production of hydrogen.5–9 To achieve highly efficient PEC water splitting, great efforts have been dedicated to develop various photoelectrode materials in pure water electrolytes. Recently, some studies have turned to hydrogen production from seawater or wastewater, given that very precious freshwater is being preserved for agriculture, industry and human needs.10–12 For instance, urea [CO(NH2)2] has been proposed as an alternative hydrogen source for its gravimetric hydrogen content of 6.7%. Additionally, millions of tons of human urine are produced, which is 500 times more than the market demand of 0.5 Mt per day.5 Therefore, sunlight-driven photoelectrochemical hydrogen releasing from urea could provide a sustainable solution for hydrogen production and new insights into the purification of wastewater.
Compared to the two-electron hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is comparatively more complex because this reaction requires a 4e− transfer process. Similarly, the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) has intrinsically more sluggish kinetics owing to a 6e− transfer process and complicated gas evolution steps (N2 and CO2).13 Thus, the oxidation reaction of water or urea that occurs in the photoanode is a speed-limiting step in the PEC system.14 The monoclinic scheelite BiVO4 with a band gap of ∼2.4 eV exhibits high potential as a photoanode since it has a good capability to harvest visible light and a high theoretical solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 9.1%.15 However, the practical performance of pristine BiVO4 photoanodes always suffers from slow charge transport, poor charge separation and sluggish oxidation kinetics,16,17 which limit its overall quantum efficiency. To overcome these drawbacks, hybrid nanostructures based on BiVO4 have been constructed, combining with another semiconductor, conducting materials, as well as cocatalysts. However, defects and interfacial energy levels may exist at the new generated interface due to the hard match between the photocatalyst and the functional layer, which results in serious recombination during the charge separation and transport process.18,19 For instance, Li et al. found that the interfacial energetics between the semiconductor and cocatalysts play a critical role in their PEC performance by constructing a Schottky heterojunction photoanode.20 Therefore, a well-constructed and highly-matched hybrid based on a BiVO4 photoanode is still highly necessary for achieving an efficient PEC process.
In this work, we present the design and synthesis of a nanostructured photoanode based on an electron-capture-layer@photocatalyst@hole-capture-catalyst composite for a high performance PEC process. The BiVO4 is uniformly dispersed on the surface of SnO2 nanorod arrays (NRAs) by a seed-directed in situ growth method, which guarantees a highly matched interface between SnO2 and BiVO4 and thereby facilitates the charge transport. After further deposition of Co-Pi cocatalysts, the as-fabricated SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode exhibits a largely enhanced PEC water splitting performance with a maximum photocurrent density of 2.63 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is 6.58 times higher than that of pristine BiVO4 (∼0.40 mA cm−2). This value is also superior to most reported BiVO4-based photoanodes (most are below 2 mA cm−2). Moreover, the as-prepared ternary photoanode has been demonstrated to show high PEC activity for urea oxidation, with an enhanced photocurrent density of 3.44 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. As far as we know, this is the first time that the PEC urea oxidation has been achieved in a neutral solution.
2. Experimental sections
2.1 Chemicals
Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, SnCl2·2H2O, ZnCl2, urea, ethanol, ethylene glycol (EG) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent (Beijing Co., Ltd.). Vanadium(III) acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2) was purchased from Shanghai Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co., Ltd. All reagents were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. Deionized water was used throughout the experiments. FTO substrates (F: SnO2, 14 Ω) were received from Wuhan GeAo Teaching Instruments Co., Ltd.
2.2 Preparation of SnO2 NRAs
The SnO2 NRAs directly grown on FTO glass substrates were prepared by a modified low-temperature CVD method. In a typical experiment, 100 mg of SnCl2·2H2O was mixed with 1 g of ZnCl2 powder to form a mixture, which was then put into a ceramic crucible. One clean FTO glass substrate was horizontally covered on the crucible, with the conductive side facing down. The furnace was heated up to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 and kept at the temperature for 15 min. Then, the furnace was switched off and was cooled to room temperature naturally. Finally, a gray thin film was grown on the conductive glass substrate. Subsequently, the thin film was cleaned with dilute hydrochloric acid in an ultrasound bath for 1 min, and rinsed with deionized water to remove any possible contaminants on the sample.
2.3 Preparation of SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi NRAs
The BiVO4 layer as a shell material was prepared from a Bi metal precursor. In a typical synthesis, a Bi metal layer was electrodeposited on the surface of the prepared SnO2 substrate in a three electrode quartz cell system (CHI 660E, Shanghai ChenHua Instrument Co., Ltd). The electrolyte was prepared by dissolving Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (0.4852 g) into a solution containing EG (100 mL) and H2O (50 mL). The deposition was carried out by passing 8.35 × 10−2 C cm−2 at E = −0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl. After electrodeposition, the Bi metal shell was coated on the surface of the SnO2 NRAs, washed with ethanol and dried by blowing air.
Then, SnO2@Bi NRAs was converted into SnO2@BiVO4 NRAs by a chemical–thermal process: 200 μL of 0.2 mol L−1 VO(acac)2 dimethyl sulfoxide solution was dripped onto the surface of the SnO2@Bi NRAs film (geometric area = 2 cm2); the film was then heated at 450 °C for 2 hours in air with a rate of 2 °C min−1; after calcination, the as-prepared film was placed in 1 mol L−1 NaOH solution for 30 min while stirring gently to remove the residual V2O5. Co-Pi was then electrodeposited on the SnO2@BiVO4 NRAs photoanode under the conditions reported previously.21 Co-Pi was electrodeposited at +1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl for 5 mC cm−2, while a longer deposition time or a larger applied potential gave larger transient currents and reduced steady photocurrents.
The pristine BiVO4 photoanode was also prepared for comparison as reported previously.14 To investigate the effects of SnO2 thickness and morphology on the PEC performance of the SnO2@BiVO4 composite photoanode, we set the mass of reactant stannous chloride dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O) to 25, 50, 100 and 150 mg (denoted as 25-SnO2@BiVO4, 50-SnO2@BiVO4, 100-SnO2@BiVO4 and 150-SnO2@BiVO4, respectively. The photoanode prepared without ZnCl2 powder was denoted as 100*-SnO2@BiVO4).
2.4 Characterization
SEM images were obtained by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Zeiss Supra 55, at 20.0 kV). High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were noted on a JEOL JEM-2010 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Crystallographic information for the samples was collected using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/MAX-2500 diffractometer, copper Kα radiation with λ = 0.154 nm). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) analyses were performed on a Thermo VG ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using Al Kα radiation at a pressure of about 2 × 10−9 Pa. Solid-state UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured at room temperature using a spectrometer equipped with an integrating sphere attachment (Shimadzu UV-3000) by using BaSO4 as a background sample. The signal from the FTO conductive glass was subtracted. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a RF-5301PC fluorospectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 348 nm.
2.5 Photoelectrochemical test
The PEC measurements were conducted on a three-electrode configuration in a quartz cell. The prepared heterojunction working electrode with 2 cm2 exposure area was placed into a cell with a Pt counter electrode and Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The cell was filled with 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (shorthand for PBS, pH = 7), and the light source employed in PEC tests was a 300 W xenon lamp with an AM 1.5 G filter. The linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) were operated at 20 mV s−1 over a potential range from −0.4 to 1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl both in the dark and under illumination. All potentials mentioned were converted into the potential versus RHE (in volt) according to eqn (1): ERHE = EAg/AgCl + EAg/AgCl vs. NHE + 0.059pH(1)
The EAg/AgCl vs. NHE (versus normal hydrogen electrode) in eqn (1) is 0.197 V at 20 °C.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on the electrochemical workstation mentioned above at an open circuit voltage of 1.23 V vs. RHE under illumination with 0.1 V amplitude of perturbation and a frequency between 100 kHz and 0.1 Hz. The measured impedance data were fitted to an appropriate equivalent circuit using the Zview software package (version 3.2c) to derive the resistance values. Mott–Schottky plots were evaluated at a direct current (DC) potential range from −0.8 to −0.1 V vs. Ag/AgCl at a frequency of 1 kHz.
The incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the samples was measured under monochromatic light illumination at 1.23 V vs. RHE. Monochromatic light was generated using the Oriel Cornerstone 130 monochromator, and the output power was measured using a photodiode detector. The IPCE was calculated using eqn (2): IPCE = (1240 × J)/(λ × Plight)(2)where J is the measured photocurrent density (mA cm−2), λ is the wavelength of the incident light (nm) and P is the power density of monochromatic light at each wavelength (mW cm−2).
The absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE) was obtained by dividing the IPCE by the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) using eqn (3) and (4): APCE = IPCE/LHE(3) LHE = 1–10−A(λ)(4)where A(λ) is the absorbance at wavelength λ.
The photoconversion efficiency (η) was calculated using eqn (5): η = J(1.23 − ERHE)/Plight.(5)
PEC measurements with H2O2 as a hole scavenger were recorded in 0.1 M PBS with the addition of 0.1 mol L−1 H2O2. The efficiency of charge injection (ηinj) by surface-reaching holes was calculated by eqn (6): ηinj = JH2O/JH2O2(6)where JH2O is the photocurrent density obtained in the PEC water oxidation experiment, while JH2O2 is the photocurrent density obtained in the PEC measurements with H2O2 as a hole scavenger.
The charge separation efficiency (ηsep) was calculated according to eqn (7): JH2O = Jabs × ηsep × ηinj(7)where Jabs is the photocurrent density resulting from the complete conversion of the absorbed irradiation, which is a constant with a fixed semiconductor photocatalyst and illumination source. Herein, BiVO4 is the only semiconductor photocatalyst in the three photoanodes (BiVO4, SnO2@BiVO4 and SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi). Therefore, Jabs for these photoanodes was calculated to be 7.5 mA cm−2 under a 100 mW cm−2 Xe lamp irradiation.
The amount of the evolved oxygen was measured using a Neo-FOX oxygen-sensing system (Ocean Optics Inc.) equipped with a FOXY probe inserted into the headspace of a gastight cell. The cell was purged with nitrogen for 0.5 h prior to measurement. The oxygen fluorescence signal was allowed to stabilize once the nitrogen had been stopped. After the residual oxygen signal became constant, oxygen evolution was monitored at 1.23 V vs. RHE for 1 h.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Preparation and characterization
The preparation process of the SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi NRAs photoanode is illustrated in Scheme 1, in order to construct a well-defined electron-capture@photocatalyst@hole-capture hybrid system for highly efficient PEC reactions. Typically, 1D SnO2 NRAs were firstly grown on the FTO substrate via a modified low-temperature CVD method. Then, amorphous Bi metal was deposited on the surface of SnO2 NRAs using an electrochemical method, which was in situ transformed to a uniform BiVO4 layer by a chemical–thermal process. By comparison with bare SnO2 NRAs, it is clearly observed that the BiVO4 thin layer was well-covered. Finally, the thin amorphous Co-Pi layer was introduced on the SnO2@BiVO4 NRAs.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the fabrication of the SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi NRAs photoanode. 
According to the SEM images (Fig. 1a), the SnO2 nanorods are aligned perpendicularly to the FTO substrate, with an average diameter of ∼80 nm and an average length of ∼500 nm, and the inset is the corresponding gray-white physical photograph. Then, amorphous Bi metal was deposited on the surface of the SnO2 NRAs, as seen in the black physical photograph (Fig. 1b). After the SnO2@Bi NRAs were converted into SnO2@BiVO4 NRAs by a chemical–thermal process (Fig. 1c), the corresponding photograph turned bright yellow. The fine nanoparticles of Co-Pi were deposited on the SnO2@BiVO4 NRAs, and the color of the SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode became slightly darker as shown in Fig. 1d. A cross-sectional SEM image of the bare SnO2 NRAs is displayed in Fig. 1e, which shows that the SnO2 NRs have an average inter-rod (axis-to-axis) spacing of about 100 nm. After growing a thin layer of BiVO4, the as-fabricated SnO2@BiVO4 NRAs have a similar length as the pristine SnO2 NRAs (Fig. 1f), which indicates that most of the BiVO4 was coated on the sidewalls of the SnO2 NRs rather than on top. After the Co-Pi nanoparticles were deposited, there was no obvious change in morphology. Moreover, the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) image of the as-prepared SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode indicates the presence of Sn, O, Bi, V, Co and P (Fig. S1†). In addition, the atomic percentages of V and Bi elements are 2.59% and 2.32% respectively, which is in keeping with the stoichiometric ratio of BiVO4. To elucidate the microscopic structure of the SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode, a detailed investigation using TEM and HRTEM was conducted. Fig. 1h shows a TEM image of SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi with a diameter of approximately 100 nm containing a 10 nm thickness of the BiVO4 and Co-Pi shell layer. The high magnification HRTEM image of SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi shows facet distances of 0.26 nm and 0.226 nm (Fig. 1i), which is consistent with the (101) spacing of the tetragonal SnO2 crystal phase and the (211) lattice plane of BiVO4 respectively, further implying the formation of a SnO2@BiVO4 heterojunction.

The phase structure of the SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi NRAs grown on the FTO substrate was further confirmed by XRD (Fig. 2a). All diffraction peaks of pure SnO2 can be easily indexed to those of a tetragonal SnO2 cell with lattice parameters of a = b = 4.738 Å, c = 3.187 Å and α = β = γ = 90° (JCPDS no. 71-0652). The peaks at 2θ values of 33.87, 57.82 and 64.74 were indexed to the (101), (002) and (112) planes of SnO2, respectively. Moreover, no other crystalline phases like ZnCl2 or ZnO were detected, indicating that the growth of SnO2 NRAs is controlled by the vapor–solid (VS) process.22 The ZnCl2 powder in the reactant just serves as a dispersant for the synthesis of SnO2 in the CVD system. After deposition of metal Bi and in situ growth of BiVO4, new reflections appear for SnO2@BiVO4 that are indexed to the (011), (112), (004), (211) and (301) planes of a monoclinic BiVO4 structure (JCPDS no. 75-1866), and no other crystalline phases like V2O5 or Bi2O3 were detected. This indicates that SnO2 and BiVO4 with separate phases coexist in the system, providing a chance for the formation of a heterojunction in the interface between SnO2 and BiVO4. Furthermore, the strongest diffraction peak (101) of SnO2 in the SnO2@BiVO4 core–shell NRAs is negatively shifted, which means there is an intense interaction between SnO2 and BiVO4. After further deposition of amorphous Co-Pi by an electrochemical method, no new reflections associated with Co-Pi were detected, implying the high dispersion of Co-Pi, which is consistent with the previous reported result.23

The chemical states of the atoms in pristine BiVO4 and SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi were investigated by XPS analysis. From the survey spectrum shown in Fig. S2a,† peaks originating from Bi, V, Sn, O, Co and P were found. Fig. S2b–f† also show the core level XPS of Sn 3d, Bi 4f, V 2p, Co 2p and P 2p scanned at higher resolutions, which are consistent with the previous reports.24–26 It is noteworthy that the presence of asymmetric XPS spectrum of O 1s peak (Fig. 2b) indicates the existence of different oxygen species on the surface of the SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode. The binding energies located at 532.1 and 530.6 eV are ascribed separately to the O 1s orbit of lattice oxygens of SnO2 and the O 1s orbit of lattice oxygens of BiVO4 crystallites respectively. The intensity of the binding energy located at 532.1 eV for SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi is obviously higher than that in BiVO4, which implies the strong interaction between SnO2 and BiVO4.
Diffuse reflectance UV-visible spectra (DRS) were collected to understand the influence of the SnO2@BiVO4 photoanode heterostructure on light harvesting capability. As demonstrated in Fig. 2c, the absorption edge of SnO2@BiVO4 is extended compared to pristine BiVO4, which implies that the SnO2@BiVO4 photoanode has better visible light absorption capacity. In addition, the light absorption of the SnO2@BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode was not affected by the thin Co-Pi catalyst layer. As reported previously, monoclinic BiVO4 is a direct semiconductor. The Eg (band gap energy) values of three photoanodes are estimated from the plot of (αEphoton)2vs. Ephoton as shown in Fig. 2d. The absorption edge energies of the BiVO4 and SnO2@BiVO4 heterostructures are 2.50 and 2.46 eV, respectively, evaluated by the extrapolated value of Ephoton at α = 0. The band gap of SnO2@BiVO4 is slightly narrower compared with the pristine BiVO4 film, which can be ascribed to a favorable band bending between SnO2 and BiVO4.27–29
3.2 PEC water splitting
The PEC measurements were achieved under AM 1.5 G illumination from the backside of the photoanodes in 0.1 M PBS (pH = 7). As shown in Fig. 3a, the photocurrents of all the BiVO4-based materials increases with anodic bias, implying the successful water oxidation on these photoelectrodes. The SnO2@BiVO4 core–shell NRAs shows an obvious improved current density compared with the pristine BiVO4, which can be further enhanced by deposition of Co-Pi. Typically, a photocurrent of 2.63 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE for SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi was achieved, which is 6.58 and 2.10 times higher than that of BiVO4 and SnO2@BiVO4 respectively.

(d) Photocurrent–time curves at 1.23 V vs. RHE. The IPCE (e) and APCE (f) measured at 1.23 V vs. RHE under monochromatic light irradiation. All measurements were taken in 0.1 M PBS solution. 
To further study the photoresponse of these photoanodes, transient photocurrent measurements were carried out under chopped light illumination (Fig. 3b). The LSVs clearly demonstrate that the SnO2@BiVO4 NRAs photoanode exhibits a fast light response, which indicates the improvement in PEC performance after introducing the SnO2 core. It is worth mentioning that the decoration of the Co-Pi catalyst further accelerates the surface oxidation kinetics with a more prompt and reproducible photocurrent response. Moreover, the photoconversion efficiency (PCE) of each photoanode was calculated based on the current–voltage curve as a function of the applied voltage (Fig. 3c), where a much improved PCE of 0.6% at 0.8 V vs. RHE was obtained for SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi, tenfold that of pristine BiVO4 (0.06%). As reported previously, the recombination of generated charge carriers will lead to an anodic photocurrent gradually decreased to a steady state plateau.30 The chronoamperometry measurement under chopped light illumination gives a fast and reproducible photocurrent response in five cycles of switching light ON and OFF for the SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode (Fig. 3d). In contrast, the pristine BiVO4 photoanode shows a relatively steady current but with the lowest activity, while the SnO2@BiVO4 photoanode displays a huge enhancement in photocurrent density but suffers an obvious photocurrent spike. In order to improve the charge injection efficiency, the Co-Pi cocatalyst was introduced to accelerate the surface oxidation kinetics, then the spike disappears and the charge accumulation diminishes. This indicates that the ternary photoanode has suppressed electron–hole recombination as well as fast surface oxidation kinetics. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured to understand the relationship between the PEC activity and the wavelength of the incident light (Fig. 3e). Typically, the maximum IPCEs are obtained at 400 nm, which are 16.0%, 27.6% and 47.4% for BiVO4, SnO2@BiVO4 and the SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode respectively. The higher IPCE value of the SnO2@BiVO4 core–shell heterostructure compared with pristine BiVO4 suggests fast charge separation and rapid electron transport of BiVO4 after introducing SnO2, which largely increases the solar energy conversion efficiency. The catalytic effect of Co-Pi further increased the IPCE value of the SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode, which is nearly three times higher than the IPCE of pristine BiVO4. Subsequently, the absorbed photon-to-current efficiency (APCE) of SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi at 400 nm is 53.4%, which is 2.9 times as high as that of pristine BiVO4 (Fig. 3f), revealing that absorbed photons can be utilized more efficiently due to the improved charge separation. The PEC performance of the ternary photoanode in this work is superior to most reported BiVO4-based photoanodes without sacrificial agents, as shown in Table S1.†31 It is worth mentioning that the SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode has the highest IPCE efficiency at 400 nm in all reported photoanodes based on BiVO4/SnO2.
To give a deep insight into the role of SnO2 and Co-Pi for the enhanced PEC water splitting performance of the SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode, the thickness of the SnO2 buffer layer was further investigated by controlling the mass of reactant stannous chloride dihydrate (SnCl2·2H2O). As shown in Fig. S3 and S4a,† different samples were prepared, and the corresponding SnO2 nanorod diameters, SnO2 layer thickness and photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE are listed in Table 1. It is clearly shown that improved PEC performance was observed along with the increasing of the SnO2 layer thickness, but a further increase in the thickness (∼800 nm) for 150-SnO2@BiVO4 led to a degradation of the photocurrent. As a result, 100-SnO2@BiVO4 exhibited the best PEC performance with a photocurrent of 1.25 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, where the SnO2 NRAs are arranged neatly with homogeneous diameters (∼80 nm) and an average length of ∼500 nm. In addition, 100*-SnO2@BiVO4 (no ZnCl2 powder was added during the preparation of the SnO2 layer) obtained a close photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE compared with 100-SnO2@BiVO4, while suffering a lower and slower photocurrent response at low potentials. This because the core–shell structure of 100-SnO2@BiVO4 makes the effect of the internal electric field more obvious at low potentials (Fig. S4a†), and effectively promotes the separation and transmission of photogenerated electrons.14 With the increase of reactant SnCl2·2H2O, the length and diameter of the SnO2 nanorods for 150-SnO2@BiVO4 increased, but the photocurrent density reduced due to the long distance of charge transport and less light absorption under backside illumination. The results are consistent with the distribution of Bi and V elements according to the EDX mappings of these samples. For 100*-SnO2@BiVO4 and 150-SnO2@BiVO4, Bi and V elements are mainly distributed in the upper region, which means that BiVO4 is essentially piled up above the SnO2 layer, not dispersed on the surface of the SnO2 nanorods. To give a deep insight into the enhanced PEC water splitting performance of the heterojunction photoanode, the EIS spectra were recorded at 1.23 V vs. RHE under illumination (Fig. S4b†). The Rct of each SnO2@BiVO4 photoanode is smaller than that of pristine BiVO4, suggestive of the superior charge transport capability of the SnO2 core-layer. Fig. S4c† further demonstrates that the core–shell structure is favorable for charge separation, meanwhile the charge separation efficiency of each photoanode with a SnO2 hole blocking layer is much more than that of pristine BiVO4. However, the charge injection efficiency of each sample is dissatisfactory (Fig. S4d†). The above results suggest the positive impact of the SnO2@BiVO4 NRAs core–shell structure for charge separation, but no obvious effect on the surface reaction kinetics. As shown in Fig. S5,† the charge separation efficiency after Co-Pi cocatalyst modification is nearly maintained, but the charge injection efficiency has been improved significantly. This further reveals that the SnO2 conducting core-layer enhances the charge separation efficiency and the Co-Pi cocatalyst improves the surface reaction kinetics.

3.3 PEC urea oxidation
Urea is a major component (∼2% mass fraction) of human/animal urine, and millions of tons are produced every day.32 However, human urine has been considered as wastewater that could raise environmental issues such as nitrate contamination of ground water.33 The performance of the SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi core–shell NRAs photoanodes for PEC urea oxidation was measured in a neutral medium of nearly real urine solution containing 0.1 M PBS and 2% urea. To investigate the advantages of PEC urea oxidation with the contrast of electrochemical urea oxidation, the performance of BiVO4 and SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi for urea oxidation under light illumination was studied (Fig. 4a). Without illumination, both the pristine BiVO4 and SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi NRAs can hardly produce urea oxidation in a neutral electrolyte. Surprisingly, the onset potential of urea oxidation shifts to 0.2 V vs. RHE under light illumination, which is significantly lower than the potential required for urea electrolysis (1.6 V vs. RHE). In comparison to pristine BiVO4, SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi exhibits an even more negative onset potential and significantly excellent PEC performance for urea oxidation. Compared with the reported articles, PEC oxidation of urea can effectively convert solar energy into chemical energy and greatly reduce the overpotential compared with the electrochemical process. It is also noted that the SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode in this work exhibits the largest cathodic shift of the onset potential compared to other photoelectrodes reported in the literature (Table S2†). Furthermore, the urea oxidation in a neutral solution in this work is mild, which is more environmentally friendly and safe than that of strong alkali solution. As shown in Fig. 4b, the 100-SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi NRAs exhibit the best PEC performance for urea oxidation, giving rise to a current density of 3.44 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. In the absence or presence of urea (Fig. 4c), both pristine BiVO4 and SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi have a higher photocurrent density for urea oxidation (3.44 and 0.84 mA cm−2 for SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi and BiVO4 respectively) than that of water oxidation (2.63 and 0.40 mA cm−2 for SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi and BiVO4 respectively) at 1.23 V vs. RHE. Moreover, both of the two photoanodes produce two stages of oxidation, which suggests that urea oxidation takes precedence over water oxidation, which is consistent with their oxidation electrode potentials. The chemical reactions at the anodes are described by the following equations:6 CO(NH2)2 + H2O → CO2 + N2 + 3H2, E0 = 0.37 V; ΔG0 = +214 kJ mol−1(8) 2H2O → O2 + 2H2, E0 = 1.23 V; ΔG0 = +237.2 kJ mol−1(9)

(c) Photocurrent–potential curves under illumination with different electrolytes. (d) Photocurrent–potential curves under illumination with different urea concentrations. (e) Photocurrent density at 1.23 V vs. RHE for the BiVO4 and SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi samples. (f) Photocurrent–time response curves at 1.23 V vs. RHE under illumination. 
In addition, the PEC urea oxidation performance of the SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode with various urea concentrations was investigated (Fig. 4d). The photocurrent density is enhanced along with increased urea concentration from 0 to 10% in the electrolyte. From the statistical graph in Fig. 4e, it is very intuitive to see that the PEC urea oxidation properties of SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi are obviously several times that of pristine BiVO4 in neutral solutions of different urea concentrations. To compare the stability with water oxidation, 1.23 V vs. RHE was chosen as the applied potential in the chronoamperometry measurements. As displayed in Fig. 4f, the stability of the SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode with different electrolytes was examined. When the photoanodes were exposed to incident light, the anodic photocurrent spikes of the two samples were observed and then gradually decreased to a steady state plateau after about 10 min. It was found that the photocurrent remains at 90.2% after one hour for the SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode in urea electrolyte when the steady state plateau is reached, indicating high stability of the as-obtained photoanode. The amount of O2 evolved during PEC water oxidation was measured using an O2 fluorescent probe in a gastight cell with the electrode held at 1.23 V vs. RHE (Fig. S6†). The solid red curve plots the O2 concentration predicted from the photocurrent assuming 100% faradaic efficiency, and the solid black curve plots the experimentally measured O2 concentration. The faradaic efficiency was calculated by dividing the experimentally measured amount of O2 by the amount of O2 predicted from the photocurrent.34 In PBS solution, the faradaic efficiency of water oxidation was nearly 100%. Meanwhile, in the process of PEC urea oxidation, the products of urea oxidation are N2 and CO2, and O2 evolution only comes from water splitting. The faradaic efficiency of O2 evolution is 20–40% in urea solution, which means that most of the other photogenerated holes are used in urea oxidation.
3.4 Mechanism discussion
The photoluminescence (PL) behavior, originating from the recombination of photoinduced electron–hole pairs, can reflect the surface separation efficiency of charge carriers in semiconductors.35 As shown in Fig. 5a, the pristine BiVO4 photoanode displays rather strong PL emission peaks within the 520–545 nm region. In contrast, the PL intensity of SnO2@BiVO4 decreases significantly, and the SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode shows a further decline, which indicates suppressed recombination of photogenerated charge carriers with the incorporation of SnO2 and Co-Pi. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies were carried out to investigate the charge transport behavior in these photoanodes, as shown in Fig. 5b. The ternary SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode displays the smallest charge transfer resistance (corresponding to the semicircle diameter in the plot) among these three samples, indicating the fastest charge transport kinetics. Compared to pristine BiVO4, the resistance of SnO2@BiVO4 is obviously smaller than that of BiVO4, suggestive of the superior charge transport capability of the SnO2 nanorods. Moreover, the flat band potential is obtained by extrapolating the Mott–Schottky plot to 1/C2 = 0 (Fig. 5c), which exhibits an evidently positive shift for SnO2@BiVO4, implying a decrease in the bending of band edges between SnO2 and BiVO4. This confirms the contribution of the SnO2 buffer layer to the improved charge separation. Based on the discussion above, we herein attempted to construct a model to clarify the enhanced PEC performance in the SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi NRAs system. As indicated in Fig. 5d, ordered 1D SnO2 NRAs were selected for the construction of a core–shell structure as an appropriate charge acceptor to facilitate charge transport; a heterojunction formed with two n-type semiconductors accelerates the charge separation efficiency due to the favorable band bending between SnO2 and BiVO4; finally Co-Pi oxygen evolution catalyst (OEC) promotes the surface reactions.

(e) The square box shows the energy diagram of the SnO2@BiVO4 heterojunction photoanode and illustrates the basic operation mechanism for solar driven water splitting and urea oxidation. 

Fig. 5e illustrates the mechanism of solar-driven hydrogen production from urea solution using a band energy diagram. Under light illumination, photoexcited electrons (e−) and holes (h+) produced in BiVO4 occupy the conduction band (EC) and valence band (EV) respectively. For the pristine BiVO4 without the SnO2 buffer layer, the photogenerated electrons in the EC will reach the defect trapping states (DTS*) at the FTO/BiVO4 interfaces through path ①, which may facilitate charge recombination and result in the degradation of PEC performance.27 In contrast, for the SnO2@BiVO4 photoanode with suitable thickness of the SnO2 layer, the DTS* located at the FTO/BiVO4 interface are fully passivated. Furthermore, the SnO2 buffer layer induces favorable band bending in the BiVO4 layer (Fig. 5c), which leads to efficient electron transport towards the FTO through path ② and effectively prohibits charge recombination. A schematic illustration of the band alignment of SnO2 and BiVO4 is shown in Fig. S7† based on the Mott–Schottky curves and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) analyses. The lower flat band of BiVO4 than that of SnO2 guarantees the electron transfer from BiVO4 to SnO2, which is consistent with the XPS results. In addition, the photogenerated holes in the EV for BiVO4 probably cannot tunnel through the SnO2 hole blocking layer. Instead, the highly dispersed Co-Pi can be oxidized by the holes to higher valence Co3+ or Co4+,36,37 which efficiently catalyze urea and water oxidation.
4. Conclusions
In summary, well-defined 1D SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi NRAs directly grown on a FTO substrate have been successfully fabricated, where the SnO2 serves as the electron acceptor to facilitate charge transport due to its extremely high intrinsic electron mobility. Favorable band bending and satisfactory hole blocking capability with a SnO2 buffer layer between BiVO4 and a FTO substrate enhanced the charge separation and reduced the chance of recombination. Finally, an efficient Co-Pi as a surface electrocatalyst is utilized to accelerate the sluggish kinetics. The resulting SnO2@BiVO4/Co-Pi photoanode exhibits largely enhanced performance of PEC water splitting and urea oxidation compared with the pristine BiVO4 photoanode. Promisingly, the successful demonstration of solar driven hydrogen releasing from neutral urea solution will provide a sustainable solution for hydrogen production and new insights into wastewater treatment.
