    , Accepted 28th July 2016First published on 28th July 2016AbstractFuture solar cells are expected to generate electricity under all weather conditions. To address this profound issue, we take the first step to produce solar cells that can generate electricity under both rainy and sunny conditions. In the current study, a bifunctional solar cell realizing photoelectric conversion under solar irradiation along with the electric signals by dropping raindrops was produced by integrating a monolayer graphene with a solar cell, yielding a maximal photoelectric conversion efficiency of 7.69% under AM1.5 irradiation as well as a current of 0.66 μA per raindrop and a voltage of 61.8 μV per raindrop by simulated raindrops. Owing to the optical loss across the monolayer graphene, the solar cell architecture was optimized, yielding a solar cell efficiency of 9.14% as well as a current of a few microamps per raindrop and a voltage of tens of microvolts per raindrop. Moreover, the newly launched solar cell has good stability under the persistent dropping of simulated rain. The current work can also extend our knowledge of advanced all-weather solar cells.
1 Introduction
The advanced electricity generation devices by renewable resource are considered a revolutionary event that have attracted tremendous attention in recent few years.1–4 Compared to the traditional energy conversion platforms made by converting solar energy to electricity,5–8 devices utilizing nonprecious species and realizing electricity generation beyond sunlight irradiation are particularly promising for integrating with cost-effectiveness and high efficiency. The state-of-the-art solar cells can only be driven by sunlight on sunny days, while the solar-to-electric conversion efficiency is zero at night and almost zero under other dark conditions such as rainy days. One of the solutions to this impasse is to produce all-weather solar cells that can be triggered by multiple stimuli according to the rational design of functional components and charge transportation.9 To address this issue, we developed a flexible solar cell that can be triggered to produce electricity by simulated sun and rain,10 in which a graphene film is hot-pressed onto the back side (insulating polymer) of an indium tin oxide/polyethylene terephthalate (ITO/PET) plastic substrate, whereas the solar cell is built on the ITO layer. Real raindrops are not pure water; they contain salts that split into positively and negatively charged ions. When raindrops are dropped onto a graphene surface, they spread quickly to the periphery, forming π-electron|cation electric double-layer (EDL) pseudocapacitors at the graphene/raindrop interface11 thus dragging electron migration and charging at the front of the droplets. The raindrops can shrink rapidly on the graphene surface, releasing electrons to graphene and discharging the pseudocapacitor. The charging–discharging processes can yield current and voltage signals under the dropping of rainwater. Until now, the corresponding report has attracted considerable attention because it extends our knowledge of advanced all-weather solar cells. On the other hand, this strategy is not applicable to high-efficiency solar cells with a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate because of its frangible and non-cohesive nature. Therefore, a prerequisite for high-efficiency all-weather solar cells is to explore an avenue of building this solar cell architecture onto a rigid FTO glass substrate. Moreover, the architectures of these solar cells are still challenging for practical applications.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of TiO2 anode
A TiO2 colloid was synthesized according to the modified procedures in a previous report.12 A layer of TiO2 film with an average thickness of 10 μm and an active area of 0.25 cm2 was made by the doctor-blade method onto the FTO layer of a commercial FTO glass substrate. Subsequently, the TiO2 film was heated to 450 °C for 30 min and sensitized by 0.25 mmol dm−3 N719 ethanol solution for 24 h.
2.2 Fabrication of monolayer graphene covered TiO2 anode
The monolayer graphene (sheet resistance: 300–500 Ω sq−1, coverage > 95%, size: 5 cm × 5 cm) covered FTO glass (sheet resistance: 12 Ω sq−1, purchased from Hartford Glass Co., USA) was purchased from 2D Carbon (Changzhou) Tech. Inc. LTD and used without further treatment.
2.3 Coating of ITO film on FTO glass
The required amount of indium nitrate was dissolved in diacetylmethane using diethanol amine as an additive. After refluxing at 60 °C for 3 h, stannic chloride (the molar ratio of In to Sn was 10:1) was dissolved in ethanol to form a homogeneous solution, which was added to the abovementioned indium nitrate solution to obtain the ITO sol. The ITO sol was subsequently coated onto the back side (glass side) of a commercial FTO glass, dried in air, and calcined at 550 °C for 30 min. Finally, an ITO/glass/FTO conductive glass substrate was obtained.
2.4 Electrophoresis deposition of graphene film
To realize the solar cell architecture in Fig. 1a, the graphene film covered counter electrodes (CEs) were produced according to the procedures. The graphene oxide (GO) solution was prepared using Hummers' method. In detail, 2 g of natural graphite powder was dispersed in a mixture of 1 g of NaNO3 and 45 mL of concentrated H2SO4 (98%) in an ice bath. Subsequently, 6 g of KMnO4 was added to the abovementioned mixture. After reaction for 5 min, the solution was heated to 35 °C for 30 min. Under vigorous agitation for 15 min, 92 mL of deionized water was dropped, and 80 mL of deionized water and H2O2 solution (3%) were used to remove KMnO4. The final solution was centrifuged at 7200 rpm for 30 min and rinsed with deionized water to pH = 3–4. After being dispersed in deionized water, the homogeneous GO solution with a concentration of 2.15 g L−1 was obtained by centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 30 min.

The amplified diagram represents the charge distribution and formation of π-electron|cation electrical double-layer pseudocapacitance at the graphene/simulated raindrop interface. The two electrodes including A and B for measuring the current and voltage signals under simulated raindrops were coated with silver paint and subsequently protected with ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer. 
The GO electrode was fabricated by an electrophoresis deposition method at a potential of 5 V for 2 h. An ITO/glass/FTO conductive glass was used as a substrate and the GO film was deposited onto the ITO layer. Finally, the resultant GO electrode was reduced by immersing the electrode in a mixture including 40 mL of ethanol and 20 drops of HI (47%) for 12 h. After rinsing with anhydrous alcohol and deionized water, the graphene/ITO/glass/FTO electrode was obtained.
The feasibility of synthesizing graphene/ITO/glass/FTO/CoNi alloy CE was realized by a mild hydrothermal method. A mixing aqueous solution consisting of 5 mM Co(NO3)2, 20 mM Ni(NO3)2, and 2 mL of hydrazine hydrate (85 wt%) was made by agitation according to a predetermined stoichiometric ratio. After vigorous agitation, the reactant was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and freshly prepared graphene/ITO/glass/FTO substrates with the FTO layer downward were immersed in it. After the reaction at 120 °C for 12 h, the FTO substrates were rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and vacuum dried at 50 °C. The graphene/ITO/glass/FTO/PtCoNi alloy CE was prepared by immersing the as-synthesized graphene/ITO/glass/FTO/CoNi alloy CE into 1 mM H2PtCl6 aqueous solution for 15 min to carry out the displacement reaction. The graphene/ITO/glass/FTO/Pt CE was also realized by the previous method using a H2PtCl6 aqueous solution as a resource.
2.5 Synthesis of CEs
To realize the solar cell architecture in Fig. 1b, the CEs were produced according to the procedures. The feasibility of synthesizing CoNi alloy CE was realized by a mild hydrothermal method. A mixing aqueous solution consisting of 5 mM Co(NO3)2, 20 mM Ni(NO3)2, and 2 mL of hydrazine hydrate (85 wt%) was made by agitation according to a predetermined stoichiometric ratio. After vigorous agitation, the reactant was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave and cleaned FTO glass substrates with FTO layer downward were immersed in it. After the reaction at 120 °C for 12 h, the FTO substrates were rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and vacuum dried at 50 °C. The PtCoNi CE was prepared by immersing the as-synthesized CoNi CE into a 1 mM H2PtCl6 aqueous solution for 15 min to carry out the displacement reaction. The Pt CE was also realized according to the previous method with a H2PtCl6 aqueous solution as a resource.
2.6 Assembly of all-weather solar cells
The all-weather solar cell in Fig. 1a was fabricated by sandwiching a redox electrolyte between a dye-sensitized TiO2 anode and a graphene film supported CE. A Surlyn film (30 μm in thickness) was used to seal the solar cell through hot-pressing. The all-weather solar cell in Fig. 1b was fabricated by sandwiching the redox electrolyte between a dye-sensitized monolayer graphene covered TiO2 anode and a CE and subsequent sealing with a Surlyn film. The active area of the TiO2 anode was 0.25 cm2, whereas the redox electrolyte consisted of 100 mM of tetraethylammonium iodide, 100 mM of tetramethylammonium iodide, 100 mM of tetrabutylammonium iodide, 100 mM of NaI, 100 mM of KI, 100 mM of LiI, 50 mM of I2, and 500 mM of 4-tert-butyl-pyridine in 50 mL acetonitrile.
2.7 Electrochemical characterizations
The electrochemical performance was recorded on a conventional CHI660E setup comprising an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, a CE of a Pt sheet, and a working electrode of FTO glass supported CE. The CV curves were recorded in a supporting electrolyte consisting of 50 mM LiI, 10 mM I2, and 500 mM LiClO4 in acetonitrile.
2.8 Photovoltaic measurements
The photovoltaic test of the bi-triggering solar cell with an active area of 0.25 cm2 was carried out by measuring the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves using a CHI660E Electrochemical Workstation under the irradiation of simulated solar light from a 100 W xenon arc lamp (XQ-500 W) in an ambient atmosphere. The incident light intensity was controlled at 100 mW cm−2 (calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell). A black mask with an aperture area of around 0.25 cm2 was applied to the surface of solar cell to avoid stray light completely. Each J–V curve has been measured repeatedly at least fifty times to eliminate the experimental error.
2.9 Measurements for electric signals
A medical syringe filled with simulated rain was utilized to control the injection velocity, equaling to rainfall intensity. Heavy rain has short-time interval, whereas it is long for light rain. The distances between the two electrodes and the height between composite film and the tip of the syringe were 15 and 25 mm, respectively. The inclination angle of the film electrode was approximately 30°. The simulated raindrops were injected using a medical syringe on the top surface of a graphene film, and the electric signals were collected with a CHI660E Electrochemical Workstation by connecting electrodes A and B. The two electrodes including A and B for measuring the current and voltage signals under simulated raindrops were coated with silver paint and then protected with ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer. If not instructed, a 0.6 M NaCl aqueous solution was used as a simulated raindrop. Amperometric i–t curve (sample interval: 0.05 s) and open circuit potential-time (sample interval: 0.1 s) modes were selected to record the current and voltage using approximately linear baselines recorded without raindrops as benchmarks.
2.10 Other characterizations
The morphology of the graphene electrode was observed on an SU8020 model scanning electron microscope (SEM, SU8020, Hitachi, Japan).
3 Results and discussion
By addressing these issues, we present an all-weather solar cell on conductive glass substrate by coating ITO film on back surface (glass side) of commercial FTO glass and subsequently depositing graphene film by an electrophoretic deposition method on a solar cell, as illustrated in Fig. 1a. Prior to this optimal design, the solar cell that is triggered by sun and rain can also be built as shown by the architecture in Fig. 1b, and a monolayer graphene is transferred to back surface (glass side) of FTO glass for building an anode. When irradiating the solar cell from an anode with incident light, the organic N719 dye molecules can absorb photons and release electrons to the conduction band of TiO2 nanocrystallites.13 The photogenerated electrons will transfer along the percolating TiO2 pathways to the FTO layer, and finally to the counter electrode (CE) along the external circuit, as shown in Fig. 1c. Owing to the high cost of preferred Pt CE,14 the cost-effective low-Pt and Pt-free alloy CEs having highly catalytic activity and charge-transfer ability were employed for such all-weather solar cells.
When irradiated from a TiO2 photoanode using simulated sunlight (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2) according to Fig. 1a, the solar cells start-up by absorbing photons with a photosensitive dye and the corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. 2a. As summarized in Table 1, the Pt based solar cell yields a front η of 7.54%. The Pt electrode has been an economic burden for the commercial application of solar cells.15 To explore a cost-effective CE catalyst without reducing cell efficiency, we developed CoNi (the atomic Co/Ni ratio is determined to be 1.000:0.305) alloy electrode by a mild solution strategy, yielding an efficiency of 8.16% on its solar cell. The measured work function of the CoNi electrode is −4.98 eV and it can be reduced further to −4.91 eV by galvanically displacing partial Co and Ni with PtCl62− due to the lower reduction potential of Co2+/Co (−0.28 V vs. SHE) or Ni2+/Ni (−0.23 V vs. SHE) than PtCl62−/Pt (+0.735 V vs. SHE) pairs. Apart from more matching work function to the potential of redox I−/I3− couples,16,17 the electron-enriched surface of the ternary PtCoNi catalyst, arising from a deviation of electrons from Co/Ni to Pt,18 is also beneficial to increase the catalytic activity toward the I3− reduction reaction (as shown in Fig. 2b). Therefore, the increased I3− + 2e− → 3I− conversion process accelerates the recovery of N719 dye and the cell performance. The results demonstrate that the efficiency has been elevated from 8.16% to 9.14%. The disadvantage of solar cell architecture in Fig. 1a is that the device should be inverted to produce electricity on rainy days. To avoid additional technologies, the architecture can also be designed according to Fig. 1b, where monolayer graphene is transferred onto the top surface (photoanode side) of the solar cell device. Owing to the high optical transparency (∼92%) of monolayer graphene in the visible-light region (Fig. 2c), the solar cell can yield reasonable J–V curves (Fig. 2d). The corresponding efficiencies are 5.63%, 6.96%, and 7.69% for the solar cells with Pt, CoNi, and PtCoNi CEs (Table 1), respectively. In comparison with the solar cell shown in Fig. 1a, the cell efficiencies reduced markedly due to light loss across the monolayer graphene layer, which is inaccessible for their practical applications. The ideal all-weather solar cell that is triggered by sun and rain should increase the ability of producing electricity under rain without sacrificing the photoelectric performance under sun irradiation. Therefore, the solar cell architecture in Fig. 1a is more suitable despite additional procedures.

Apart from the cell efficiency, Voc and Jsc also follow an order of ternary alloy electrode > binary alloy electrode > single electrode, arising from their catalytic activities toward the I3− reduction reaction. In general, the theoretical Voc is attributed to the difference between the Fermi energy level of TiO2 anode and redox potential of I−/I3− couples. However, the actual Voc output in a DSSC device is always lower than its theoretical value, mainly arising from the backward recombination reactions between electrons at the TiO2 nanocrystallites and oxidized species in electrolyte such as I3− ions. During the complicated photoelectrochemical reactions of a real DSSC system, rapid I3− → I− conversion at the CE/electrolyte interface is expected to accelerate the regeneration of photosensitive dyes and therefore electron excitation. In this fashion, the number of electrons flowing along the percolating TiO2 networks is also elevated, leading to an enhanced Jsc value. Similarly, the recombination reaction between electrons and I3− ions is restricted by the enhanced charge transfer along the TiO2 nanocrystallites arising from increased potential drop. As demonstrated in Fig. 2, PtCoNi and RuCoSe alloy electrodes have maximal catalytic activities toward the redox electrolyte and therefore maximal Voc and Jsc in their solar cell.
On rainy days, the current and voltage signals are produced by dropping simulated raindrops on the monolayer graphene electrode according to Fig. 1b at an injection velocity of 100 mL h−1. As shown in ESI Fig. S1,† there are periodic peaks during the expansion and shrinkage of raindrops on the electrode surface. The current and voltage produced are around 0.66 μA and 61.8 μV, respectively. As a reference, the corresponding current and voltage were also detected using deionized water under the same conditions, as shown in Fig. 3a, yielding no obvious signals in either current or voltage. The results demonstrate that deionized water cannot produce electrical signals on a graphene film. According to the Fig. 1a architecture, the electric signals produced by dropping simulated raindrops on a stacked graphene electrode at various injection velocities are shown in Fig. 3b and c and the corresponding electric signals are summarized in Table 2.

Why are current and voltage signals produced when dropping ionic raindrops on a graphene electrode? The ohmic resistances of the graphene film before and after dropping simulated raindrops were determined, as shown in ESI Fig. S2.† There was no obvious deviation, indicating that the ohmic resistance is unchanged during the raindrops dropping. In this fashion, the change in either current or voltage is not attributable to resistance variations. From the Lewis acid–base theory, acids are defined as electron acceptors and bases are electron donors. The unpaired electrons for Lewis bases can share with Lewis acids to form coordination bonds. Graphene is believed to be a Lewis base due to the delocalized π-electrons on the conjugated structure, whereas cations such as Na+ in raindrops is a Lewis acid. Using Lewis acid–base theory, graphene has been utilized widely as a robust absorbent for heavy metal ion removal,19 in which the delocalized π-electrons in graphene20 can combine with positively charged ions by a Lewis acid–base interaction. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the Na+ ions can adsorb π-electrons on conjugated graphene structure by Lewis acid–base interactions to form an electric double-layer pseudocapacitance at the Na+/graphene interface.11 When dropping onto graphene surface, the Na+ ions in raindrops can drag π-electrons at the spreading process, charging the pseudocapacitor at the front of the raindrops. Subsequently, the Na+ ions are desorbed at the rear of the droplets during the shrinking process, discharging the pseudocapacitor and releasing π-electrons to graphene. By measuring the cyclic voltammogram curves of the graphene|raindrop|graphene architecture, the capacitance evolution during spreading and shrinking processes can be compared. As shown in Fig. 4a, the quasi-rectangular shapes indicate an EDL pseudocapacitance behavior with fast charge/discharge reactions. Fig. 4b suggests that the capacitance has a linear relationship with the raindrop/graphene contact area in either the spreading or shrinking process. The charging and discharging reactions of EDL pseudocapacitor produce current and voltage. From the regular electric signals shown in Fig. 3b–d, we infer that an all-weather solar cell can be realized using the method reported here. Using a similar concept, other electron-enriched materials, such as polyaniline, polypyrrole, alloys, are also applicable for fabricating rain-enabled all-weather solar cells that can harvest energy from rain and sun.

The output signals are highly dependent on the time interval between two adjacent droplets and it can be inferred as the rain intensity, which is controlled by adjusting the injection velocity. As summarized in Table 2, the device yields an average current of 4.9 μA, voltage of 62.0 μV, and power of 303.8 pW (Fig. 3d) at an injection velocity of 40 mL h−1, and the corresponding parameters decrease with increasing injection velocity from 40 to 300 mL h−1. We believe the main reason is the diffusion of raindrops into the electrophoretic deposited graphene film, arising from its hydrophilicity with a water contact angle of approximately 58° (Inset in Fig. 3a). In this fashion, some delocalized π electrons may still be adsorbed by Na+ ions in previous droplets at a high injection velocity (low time interval), allowing for the formation of a reduced current, voltage and therefore power signals.
Apart from the injection velocity, the concentration of raindrops has a high impact on the signal output. ESI Fig. S3† shows the dependence of the electric signals on the NaCl concentration and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 2. The average current, voltage, and power outputs are 1.2 μA, 43.7 μV, and 31.9 pF by dropping a 0.1 M NaCl aqueous solution onto the graphene electrode, respectively. However, the signals can be increased to 1.9 μA, 102.9 μV, and 183.1 pF by utilizing a 1 M NaCl aqueous solution. The reasonable signal enhancement is attributed to the increased Na+ and Cl− concentrations. The Na+ number for 0.1 M NaCl aqueous solution is approximately 3.01 × 1018 for each droplet, which is believed to be much lower than the number of delocalized π-electrons on graphene because the carbon atoms in graphene are sp2 hybridized and contribute a 2pz electron for each conjugated –CC– segment.21,22 Therefore, the increase in Na+ concentration is beneficial to produce enhanced capacitance for current and potential output. Owing to the increased ion concentration in acid rain, the bi-triggering solar cell is expected to yield enhanced current and voltage signals toward acid raindrops. It is apparent that the electricity generated with current of a few microamps and voltage of tens of microvolts for each raindrop is much lower than the required percolation for electrical installations. A suitable combination of energy storage devices with such all-weather solar cells is promising for practical applications. The long-term stability of the device has also been studied by repeatedly dropping simulated rain droplets on electrophoretic deposited graphene surface according to Fig. 1a at an injection velocity of 100 mL h−1. As shown in Fig. 5, only 34.2% of the initial current and 81.4% of the initial voltage remained after persistent operation over 1000 s. A possible mechanism behind the signal deterioration is the occupation of π-electrons by Na+ ions as well as the removal of partial graphene nanosheets, which can be supported by ESI Fig. S4.†

4 Conclusions
An all-weather solar cell that can produce electricity under sun irradiation and raindrops was fabricated by integrating an electrophoretic deposited graphene electrode with a solar cell. Under simulated sunlight irradiation, the solar cell yielded a maximal photoelectric conversion efficiency of 9.14%. Interestingly, the current, voltage, and power outputs can be determined by dropping simulated raindrops on the graphene electrode. The preliminary results show that the signals are strongly dependent on the injection velocity and cation concentration, and the maximal current, voltage, and power output are 4.9 μA, 62.0 μV, and 303.8 pW, respectively. Except for the adjustable signals, this simple device allows for reasonable durability when suffered persistent rain dropping. The current work can inspire us to produce electricity by painting graphene tailored coatings on buildings on rainy days.
