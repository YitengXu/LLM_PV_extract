    , Accepted 16th June 2021First published on 18th June 2021AbstractHybrid perovskites are favoured over other numerous optoelectronic materials, thanks to their rapidly enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) and facile processing. At present, future developments are seriously hampered by the high toxicity of heavy metals and poor stability. Inorganic lead-free perovskites, CsSn1−xGexI3−yBry, are herein explored for superior optical performance by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). It is unveiled that the valence band maximum (VBM) is mainly occupied by the p-orbit of halide ions, while the conduction band minimum (CBM) is composed of the p-orbit of the metal ion. Moreover, Bader charge analysis shows that CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 corresponds to the most obvious charge transfer compared to the others. The defect formation energy indicates that perovskite compounds CsSn1−xGexI3−yBry, are more easily synthesized than the series CsSn1−xGexI3, and the physically accessible area is also determined in the coordinate system defined by the chemical potential change of the host atoms, ΔμSn and ΔμI. Additionally, the absorption spectra show that among the doped compounds of the form CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3−yBry, perovskite CsSn0.5Ge0.5I2Br is superior in terms of optical response in the visible-light range. The results shed a new light on the study of highly efficient and stable lead-free perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs).
1 Introduction
Perovskites, as an emerging category of photovoltaic materials, have attracted widespread attention since Miyasaka and co-workers first used them as visible-light sensitizers in 2009.1 At that time, the discovery opened a new era for perovskite applications in the field of perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs), although the resulting device had poor stability, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was only 3.8%. In following studies, it was further unveiled that perovskites can be used as either electronic or hole transport materials.2 In addition, it has been demonstrated that perovskites have unique characteristics including a facile fabrication process,3 wide visible-light response range,4,5 high optical absorption,6,7 small carrier effective mass and long diffusion length,8,9 low exciton binding energy,9–11 and so on. By virtue of these superior properties, perovskites have been widely used in the optoelectronic field to date, such as photovoltaics,12,13 thermoelectrics,14,15 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),16,17 sensors,18,19 laser and photodetectors.20,21 Among these, what deserves to be highlighted here is that the speed of improvement for the PCE of PSCs is unprecedented. It has taken only ten years for the PCE to be enhanced from the initial 3.8% to the recently certified 25.5%.22 Unfortunately, the wide commercial promotion of PSCs is strictly hampered by poor stability and intrinsic toxicity from the heavy metal lead. Hence inorganic perovskites have gradually drawn increasing attention by virtue of good stability. Among those, lead-free inorganic halide perovskites CsSnX3 (X = I, Br or Cl) are considered as the promising alternatives because they avoid potential environmental pollution from heavy metals.
Recently a new native-oxide method was proposed by Chen and co-workers to achieve highly efficient and stable lead-free PSCs.23 The key to the method was the formation of the stable native-oxide layer, in which GeO2 was doped with a small ratio of Sn. By virtue of the passive effect of the natural oxide, the recombination of photo-generated carriers was inhibited, and the stability of perovskite was enhanced. In their experiment they used mixed tin–germanium perovskite, CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3, as the light absorber, and the resulting PCE reached 7.11%. Meanwhile, in N2 atmosphere under 1 sun illumination the PCE decay of the device was less than 10% after 500 h of continuous operation. Hence the incorporation of germanium leads to the improvement of lead-free perovskites. Moreover, mixing halide anions has also been widely explored for superior optical performance and good stability.24–27 Specifically, the PCE of Br-doped lead-free PSCs has been exceeding 13%,24,25,27 and the bandgap can be exactly controlled by adjusting the proportion of Br ions, achieving the improvement in optical performance.24,26 In addition, perovskite CsSnBr3 has been demonstrated to be a black and carrier-free semiconductor,28 and exhibits good resistance against moisture and heat, which implies that CsSnBr3 is a promising candidate in terms of ecofriendly optoelectronic applications. Therefore, to evaluate lead-free perovskite in the form CsSn1−xGexI3−yBry is interesting as a potential light absorber, which is the motivation for the present work.
Among inorganic perovskites, CsSnI3 has a reasonable bandgap of 1.3 eV in terms of photovoltaic application.5,29,30 Similarly to Pb-based perovskites, Sn-based ones with the formula ASnX3 are composed of an inorganic framework of corner-sharing [SnX6]4− octahedra, in which the B ion is at the center of the [SnX6]4− octahedron. And A-site ions are located at the geometric center constituted by eight [SnX6]4− octahedra. In other words, the A ion is coordinated by twelve X ions, while the B ion interacts with six X ions.31–33 Under ambient conditions, pure CsSnI3 appears in an orthorhombic phase, and the crystal structure is gradually transformed to the cubic CsSnBr3 when Br ions are incorporated instead of I ions.34 In other words, the incorporation of Br ions means the increase of the symmetry, i.e., enhanced stability. On the other hand, for the ABX3 the partial ion substitution of the B-site ion is also an effective way to optimize the stability and the optical property of the tin-based perovskites. Tin and germanium are from the same main family, and the partial substitution of tin with germanium implies the improvement of photovoltaic performance.23,35 Therefore, in the present work we focus on perovskite compounds of the form CsSn1−xGexI3−yBry.
Based on the aforementioned analysis, the following problems remain open for the time being. Firstly, how stable are lead-free perovskite compounds CsSn1−xGexI3−yBry? Secondly, how does Ge/Br doping effect the electronic properties? Thirdly, how does Ge/Br doping influence the optical property in the visible-light range? And can the investigated compounds, CsSn1−xGexI3−yBry, be synthesized experimentally? To address these issues, the geometric structures, the electronic and optical properties, and the defect formation energy for perovskite series CsSn1−xGexI3−yBry, are explored in detail in the present work.
2 Computational method
First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have been conducted to gain insight into the electronic and optical properties of perovskite-based compounds, CsSn1−xGexI3−xBry, using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).36,37 The electron–ion interaction is herein characterized by the projected augmented wave method (PAW),38 and the exchange correlation interaction among electrons is dealt with using the GGA-PBE functional, which is under the generalized gradient approximation and presented by Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof.39,40 The involved valence electrons for the component elements are configured as Cs (5s25p66s1), Sn (4d105s25p2), I (5s25p5), Ge (3d104s24p2), and Br (4s24p5). With respect to the calculations on lattice relaxation and self-consistent convergence, a Γ-centered 3 × 3 × 2 mesh with Monkhorst–Pack method41 is adopted for the sampling of the first Brillouin zone, and a cutoff energy of 500 eV is referenced to the response function in the plane wave basis. Moreover, the convergence criteria for energy and force are set to 1 × 10−5 eV and 0.02 eV Å−1, which is sufficient for the related calculations. As is well known, the bandgaps for the semiconductors are usually underestimated by adopting the calculations in the GGA level. In the present work the time-consumed hybrid functional of HSE06 is used to obtained the exact electronic structures, which is proposed by Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof.42,43 Additionally, due to the consumption of time and calculation resources, the optical property is only simulated in the GGA-PBE level with a denser κ-point of Γ-centered 5 × 5 × 5 mesh. The absorption coefficient is obtained by,44 (1)in which the parameters of ω, ε1(ω) and ε2(ω), respectively represent the frequency of the incident light, the real part and the imaginary part of the dielectric function.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Geometric structure
In halide perovskite structures with the formula ABX3, the A site is usually occupied by univalent ions (Cs+, Rb+, FA+ or MA+), the B site by divalent metal ions including Pb2+, Sn2+, Ge2+, etc., and the X site by halide ions, Cl−, Br− or I−. To ensure the formation of perovskite structures, two crucial limitation conditions must be satisfied, one is the tolerant factor proposed by Goldschmidt,45 the other is the octahedral factor presented by Li and co-workers,46 respectively defined as follows, (2) (3)in which the parameters Ri (i = A, B, X) indicate ionic radii of the component atoms in perovskites. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that as for the halide perovskites the two indices of t and u should be limited in the range 0.813 < t < 1.107 and 0.442 ≤ u < 0.895.12 There are common phases including orthorhombic, tetragonal, trigonal and cubic, and the symmetry is higher, the value of tolerance factor is closer to 1. On the contrary, it is impossible outside of this limited range to form halide perovskites due to the distortion and deformation of [BX64−] octahedrons, instead of lower dimensional cases of 0D clusters, 1D chains, and 2D layers.47–49 The band gaps for lower halide perovskites is usually too large to be used in photovoltaic applications.50 Note that the two indices are necessary, but not always sufficient, conditions to form stable 3D ABX3-type halide perovskites.46
The optimized perovskite compounds CsSn1−xGexI3−yBry are shown in Fig. 1. With respect to the CsSnI3 in the orthorhombic phase, the involved ionic radii are rCs+ = 1.88 Å, rSn2+ = 1.15 Å, and rI− = 2.2 Å, respectively. Hence the two indices for CsSnI3 are 0.861 and 0.523, respectively, which is right in the aforementioned range. In addition to that, the other involved ionic radii are rGe2+ = 0.73 Å and rBr− = 1.96 Å. The two indices for CsGeI3 are 0.985 and 0.332, respectively. Obviously, the octahedral factor of 0.332 for CsGeI3 is outside of the limited range, which implies the poor stability. Naturally, the investigated compounds CsSn1−xGexI3−yBry are based on pure CsSnI3 in the orthorhombic phase and the detailed lattice parameters are listed in Table 1.

As for the Ge mono-doped series CsSn1−xGexI3, the lattice volume decreases with the increase of Ge content. Note that among the series CsSn1−xGexI3, the lattice volume of CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 is smaller than that of the others, which means superior stability for the geometric structure. Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated experimentally that the perovskite CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 has better stability than the other doped cases.23 Hence CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3−yBry is further studied to achieve superior stability and optical ability. As for the Br/Ge co-doped series CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3−yBry, the lattice volume monotonically decreases with the increase of Br doping ratio.
To get more insight into the effect of doping Ge/Br ions, here the Sn–I/Br (or Ge–I/Br) bond length is taken as an example, as specifically labeled in Fig. 2. As for pure CsSnI3, the Sn–I bond in the horizontal direction is 3.118 Å, and that in the vertical direction is 3.137 Å. In the perovskite compounds CsSn1−xGexI3, the Ge–I bond length for the x = 0.25 and x = 0.5 is significantly less than the Sn–I case in pure CsSnI3 with the exception of x = 0.75, which is consistent with the volume change in Table 1. In the perovskite series CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3−yBry, the Ge–Br bond length is remarkably smaller than the Ge–I case. In addition, the lattice volume of the series CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3−yBry is further reduced with the exception of CsSn0.5Ge0.5I2Br. As for the impact of bond length on the stability, the perovskite is formed by corner-shared octahedrons, which implies that the perovskite depends on the stability of octahedrons. The decrease of bond length indicates the increase of bond strength. Moreover, there is a direct impact from the strength of the metal–halide ion bond on the stability of octahedrons. It is hence concluded that the stability of the investigated series CsSn1−xGexI3−yBry can be deduced by the changes of bond length. In other words, among the Ge mono-doped series CsSn1−xGexI3 the stability of the compound CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 is better as compared to the others, which is in line with the experimental observation.23 The electronic properties for the perovskite compounds CsSn1−xGexI3−yBry, are discussed next.

3.2 Electronic properties

3.2.1 Electronic density of states. 
The electronic DOS for the series CsSn1−xGexI3−yBry are shown in Fig. 3. With regard to the CsSn1−xGexI3, the VBM is mainly composed of I-5p from the halide ions, and the CBM chiefly consists of Sn-5p/Ge-4p from the metal ions. Specifically, the electronic orbits at the VBM gradually change from Sn-5p to Ge-4p with the increase of Ge doping ratio in Fig. 3(a–e). While the electronic orbits at the CBM are gradually changed from I-5p to Br-4p with the increase of Br content. Note that in the CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3−yBry the mainly occupied electronic orbits at CBM are slightly changed with increase of the doping ratio of the Br ion, which is attributed to structural changes resulting from ion doping. In the meanwhile, the bandgap for the series CsSn1−xGexI3−yBry is effectively tuned by Ge/Br doping, and the related details are presented as follows. As shown in Fig. 4, a straightforward insight is delivered to further probe the bandgap change. It is clearly seen that the bandgap for the investigated CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3−yBry can be effectively tuned by adjusting the doping ratio of Ge/Br. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the bandgap change with the doping ratio of Ge is nonlinear, because the investigated compounds CsSn1−xGexI3 are based on pure CsSnI3 in the orthorhombic phase. As for CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3−yBry in Fig. 4(b), the bandgap increases obviously with the gradual substitution of I ions with Br ions, which is directly related to the fact that the radius of the Br ion is smaller than that of the I ion. As shown in Fig. 3 and 4, for the Ge mono-doped compounds CsSn1−xGexI3, the case of x = 0.5 has the minimum bandgap. For the Br-doped compounds CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3−yBry, the cases of y = 1, y = 2 and y = 3 have wider bandgaps than pure CsSnI3. By comparison, with the Ge mono-doped series with pure CsSnI3, it is clearly seen that the bandgap of CsSn1−xGexI3 decreases when the current bond length of Ge–I/Sn–I is shorter than that of Sn–I in pure CsSnI3, and vice versa. With respect to the compounds CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3−yBry, it is obviously seen that the bandgap increases with the injection of Br ions. Moreover, the substitution of I ions with Br ions results in the current bond length of Sn–I being longer than the original one of Sn–I, which is directly related to the change of bandgap. Next, the charge density distribution is probed to gain insight into electron transitions of the bandgap edge. Based on the aforementioned analysis, here we are focused on the charge density at the bandgap edge for CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3−yBry. As for CsSnI3 shown in Fig. 5, the electron charges at VBM cluster in the center position, it is hence not favorable for electron transitions from the VBM to the CBM. With respect to charge transfer in the compounds, electron transition is from the accumulated charges at the VBM to the empty band at the CBM under solar irradiance. So it is more favorable for electron transitions when the charge distribution is closer to the surface. As shown in Fig. 5, the charge density in the vertical direction significantly rises with the injection of Br ions, i.e., the charge accumulation at the VBM increases with Br ions instead of I ions. Therefore, it is revealed that superior electron transition in the compounds CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3−yBry benefits from substitution doping of I ions with Br ions. In other words, there is a significant change for charge distribution at the VBM when Br ions are incorporated into pure CsSnI3. Specifically, electron charge is distributed on the surface, which is favorable for electron transitions. In this respect, it also facilitates the separation of photo-generated electron–hole pairs.

3.2.2 Bader charge analysis. 

Table 2 displays Bader charge analysis for the investigated compounds, CsSn1−xGexI3−yBry. With respect to Ge mono-doped CsSn1−xGexI3, there is an obvious enhancement in electron obtainment of Sn and Ge atoms in CsSn0.75Ge0.25I3 and CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3, which means excellent stability. By contrast, the electron transfer in CsSn0.25Ge0.75I3 and CsGeI3 is lower compared to the others, which implies poor stability. Especially for CsGeI3, the poor stability is in line with the previous structural analysis, hence it is out of consideration for photovoltaic applications. Among the series CsSn1−xGexI3, the perovskite CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 is superior to the others in terms of stability, which agrees well with the impact of bond length on the stability. Moreover, Bader charge analysis in 2 also implies that in CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3−yBry the geometry stability is further enhanced with the increase of Br doping ratio. Therefore, it is found that the stability of perovskite structures is significantly enhanced by Br incorporation. In addition, there is only a slight change in electron transfer for Cs, which is in good accordance with a previous study.51

3.3 Optical properties

Fig. 6 shows the absorption spectra for the investigated CsSn1−xGexI3−yBry series in the visible-light range. With regard to CsGeI3, it is not favorable to achieve excellent photovoltaic performance, due to poor stability, as analyzed in the previous geometric structure section. With respect to the Ge mono-doped compounds CsSn1−xGexI3, it is revealed that the optical absorption ability is significantly enhanced as compared to that of pure CsSnI3. As for the series CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3−yBry, the absorption coefficient for CsSn0.5Ge0.5I2Br is remarkably higher than that for pure CsSnI3, especially in the range 505–773 nm. In the meanwhile, the absorption coefficient is lowered for CsSn0.5Ge0.5IBr2 and CsSn0.5Ge0.5Br3 as compared to pure CsSnI3, which implies that the doping ratio of Br should be limited to achieve superior optical performance.

3.4 Deformation formation energy
Under the growth conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium, the chemical potential change of the component elements in CsSnI3 are subject to the limitation of,52 ΔμCs + ΔμSn + 3ΔμI = ΔH(CsSnI3)(4)in which the chemical potential change is described by, (5)
Moreover, the chemical potential change must satisfy the restriction conditions of, (6)In addition, the chemical potential change must satisfy the restriction conditions of, (7)At the same time, to avoid the formation of possible secondary phases, SnI2 and CsI, the following two constraint conditions also must be complied with, (8)As shown in Fig. 7, the physically accessible region for pure CsSnI3 is obtained in the coordinate system defined by ΔμSn and ΔμI. The narrow area in color in Fig. 7 indicates the growth region for pure CsSnI3 under equilibrium conditions, which implies the low dissociation energy from CsSnI3 to SnI2 and CsI. Meanwhile, the growth ambient exactly indicates the growth conditions for synthesizing stochiometric CsSnI3. In other words, the n-type/p-type property for pure CsSnI3 can be flexibly tuned by the growth conditions which refer to the chemical potentials of CsI and Sn sources.

To further determine whether the doped compounds CsSn1−xGexI3−yBry, can be achieved experimentally with respect to the pure CsSnI3, it is necessary to analyze the defect formation energy, which is derived from, Ef(doped) = ΔH(doped) − ΔH(CsSnI3),(9)where ΔH represents the formation enthalpy. Moreover, the formation enthalpy is defined by, ΔH(doped) = E(doped) − niμi(bulk),(10)in which the parameter E(doped) indicates the total energy of the doped compound, μi refers to chemical potential and ni represents the number of atoms transferred into (the value is positive) or out from (the value is negative) the chemical reservoir.
From Fig. 8, it is clearly seen that the increase of Ge content enhances the defect formation energy for Ge-based perovskites, CsSn1−xGexI3. Moreover, a positive formation energy means that it is difficult to synthesize the compounds experimentally. In other words, it is not favourable to synthesize the mono-Ge doped perovskite series. By contrast, there is a great difference in the Br-doped cases. Combining the electronic properties shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, here we focused on the CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3−yBry. The defect formation energies for the CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3−yBry are negative, which implies that Br incorporation is favorable to synthesize experimentally. Note that when the doping ratio of Br is higher, the defect formation energy is lower. Additionally, combining the absorption spectra shown in Fig. 6, the perovskite compound CsSn0.5Ge0.5I2Br is superior over the others in terms of experimental synthesis and absorption ability.

4 Conclusions
In the present paper, by means of first-principles calculations, the electronic and optical properties of perovskite compounds of the form CsSn1−xGexI3−yBry, are explored for high optical response and good stability. The main results are as follows.
The optimized geometric structures show that among the germanium mono-doped compounds the perovskite CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3, has the smallest volume and the most charge transfer than the other CsSn1−xGexI3. Based on these, perovskite series CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3−yBry is further explored for the improvement of optical performance and stability. The electronic DOS indicates that the electronic states at the VBM are mainly composed of the p orbit from the B-site metal ion, while those at the CBM are primarily occupied by the p orbit from the X-site halide ion, which implies that the Ge/Br doping has a significant impact on the main occupied electronic states at the bandgap edge. The defect formation energy distinctly reveals that the compounds CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3−yBry, can be more readily synthesized than compounds CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3, which is attributed to the incorporation of the Br ion. Moreover, the physically accessible area is obtained in the coordinate system determined by ΔμSn and ΔμI from the host atoms, in which the narrow region means a low dissociation energy from CsSnI3 to SnI2 and CsI. Furthermore, the absorption spectra indicate that the absorption coefficient of the perovskite CsSn0.5Ge0.5I2Br is higher in the visible-light range than for other doped CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3−yBry. Therefore, perovskite CsSn0.5Ge0.5I2Br is a better choice for photovoltaic applications in terms of optical response and stability. The results deepen our understanding of the inherent characteristics of Ge/Br-doped Sn-based inorganic perovskites, and provide theoretical insight into the design of highly efficient and lead-free perovskite-based photovoltaic materials.
