    , Accepted 25th April 2022First published on 25th April 2022AbstractThe perovskite/hole-transporting layer interface plays a crucial role in the performance of perovskite solar cells. Herein, a conjugated polymer (CP) is employed as an interface layer in CsPbIBr2 solar cells. On top of the CsPbIBr2 layer, the CP self-assembled into a nanofibrillar film which shows multiple effects: optimization of the energy level alignment, enhancement of the hole extraction, passivation of the perovskite layer and reduction of the defect density. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of the corresponding CsPbIBr2/CP device is improved to 11.05%, with a VOC of 1.19 V, a JSC of 12.69 mA cm−2, and a FF of 73.31%. Moreover, the device efficiency retains about 91% of its initial value for nearly 900 hours in air. This proposed CP-passivated interface strategy will open a new avenue for achieving high-performance inorganic perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Metal halide perovskites exhibit excellent optoelectronic characteristics, including tunable bandgaps, strong light absorption coefficient, long carrier lifetime, long carrier diffusion length, and high defect tolerance.1–5 They have been widely employed in numerous fields, such as solar cells,6–8,48 light-emitting diodes,9 lasers,10,11 detectors,12etc. The perovskite solar cell (PSC) has achieved a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.7%,13 making it one of the most potential photovoltaic technologies in the future. In general, a PSC has a sandwich structure with a large number of surface defects and carrier transport barriers at the interface, resulting in poor stability of PSC devices when exposed to moisture, oxygen, or heat.14–16 Therefore, interface optimization is very important to improve the performance of PSCs. For inorganic PSCs, phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI),17 histamine (HA),18 poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG),19 and imidazolium-based ionic liquids (IILs)20 have been used between perovskite films and hole-transporting layers (HTLs) to optimize the surface morphologies and passivate the surface defects of perovskite films, while an ultrathin MgO layer,21 SmBr3,22 and polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE)23 were inserted between electron-transporting layers (ETLs) and the CsPbIBr2 films, providing a better substrate for perovskite growth, and the nonradiative recombination in the perovskite and at the interface was suppressed. However, the poor charge transport performance of the above mentioned interface layers may increase the interfacial resistance. Therefore, we look for interface layer materials with high charge transfer capability.
As we know, conjugated polymers (CPs) have been widely applied in organic field effect transistors (OFETs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs) with great success, owing to the impressive charge transport characteristics and PCE.24–28 CPs are often used as HTLs in PSCs, such as poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT),29 poly(triarylamine) (PTAA),30 and poly[N-9-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-3,6-bis(thiophen-5-yl)-2,5-dioctyl-2,5-di-hydropyrrolo[3,4-]pyrrole-1,4-dione] (PCBTDPP),31 but the resulting devices have a relatively low open-circuit voltage (VOC) due to additional non-radiative recombination at the perovskite/HTL interface. However, CPs have great advantages as the interface layer between perovskites and HTLs. Introducing different chemical groups, the charge transport behavior of CPs can be conveniently tuned by varying the energy levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO).32 This is conducive to charge transport between perovskites and HTLs. Lyu et al. adopted a fluorinated conjugated polymer (PFPT3) as an FAPbI3 perovskite/HTL interfacial layer, improving the energy-level alignment and the hole extraction at the interface.33
In this paper, a nanofibrillar CP film with electron-withdrawing groups is used as the interface layer between the CsPbIBr2 perovskite and HTL. Owing to the lamellar stacking and the π–π stacking of the CP backbone, the charge extraction and the energy level alignment are optimized, and the defect density is reduced, promoting the efficiency to as high as 11.05%. The efficiency is at a leading level of CsPbIBr2 PSCs. And the stability of the unencapsulated device optimized by the interface layer is improved obviously in air. The device with the CP retains about 91% of its initial efficiency for nearly 900 hours, while the control device without the CP retains only 66% of its initial efficiency. It is inferred that the valuable interface optimization strategy can be extended to other analogous perovskite materials.
Results and discussion
A CP was prepared by reaction of 6,6′-dibromodi(2-decyltetradecyl)isoindigo (2Br-ID), (3E,7E)-3,7-bis(6-bromo-1-(2-decyltetradecyl)-2-oxoindolin-3-ylidene)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (2Br-BIBDF), 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-dithiophene (2tin-DT), tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (Pd2(dba)3), tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (P(o-tol)3), and anhydrous chlorobenzene, followed by precipitation and purification. The chemical structure of the CP is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). We spin-coated the CP solution of various concentrations (0.3, 0.5, 1.0, and 3.0 mg mL−1) in chlorobenzene solvent onto the surface of CsPbIBr2 films (named 0.3 CP, 0.5 CP, 1.0 CP, and 3.0 CP, respectively). The detailed fabrication steps are described in the ESI.†

Fig. 1a–d and S2a–c† display the top-view SEM images of the pristine CsPbIBr2 film and the perovskite films deposited with the CP. The CP film on the surface of the perovskite exhibits a fibrous structure and becomes gradually compact with the concentration increasing. In previous work, it has been found that the neat CP film shows fine, clustered, and nanofibrillar crystals over the entire area in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterization.34 The crystal domains form due to the CP lamellar stacking. The introduction of large fused aromatic rings (ID and BIBDF) in the polymer backbone will not only promote lamellar stacking but also facilitate the small π–π stacking of the CP backbone, beneficial for charge transport. Here, the CP film deposited on the CsPbIBr2 layer maintains the nanofibrillar morphology and is therefore anticipated to enhance the charge extraction. The CsPbIBr2/0.5 CP film exhibits a decreased root-mean-square (RMS) roughness (8.11 nm) compared with the pristine film (9.46 nm) (Fig. 1e and f). The smoother surface will also be likely to improve the carrier extraction from the perovskite to the HTL. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images (Fig. 1g) confirm the uniform distribution of the CP on the CsPbIBr2 film surface. Fig. S3† presents the XRD patterns of the pristine CsPbIBr2 film and the CsPbIBr2 films deposited with various concentrations of the CP, indicating that all the films have the same α-phase CsPbIBr2 crystal structure, and no impurity peaks are observed, which means that CP deposition does not change the phase of CsPbIBr2 films. The (100) and (200) planes of the CsPbIBr2/0.5 CP film exhibit higher peak intensities, and the growth of crystal grains perpendicular to the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2 substrate is more conducive to charge transfer.35

To further study the influence of the CP on the optoelectronic properties of CsPbIBr2 films, UV-vis spectroscopy, steady-state PL, and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) analyses of the pristine CsPbIBr2 and the CsPbIBr2 films deposited with different concentrations of the CP were performed. Fig. 2a shows that all the UV-vis spectra have almost identical absorption values from 400 nm to 700 nm, corresponding to the bandgap of about 2.09 eV in the Tauc-plots (Fig. 2b), indicating that the CP interface layer may not affect the utilization of the solar spectrum and the light harvesting, and the bandgap does not change after CP deposition. In Fig. 2c, the PL intensity decreased with the increase of the CP concentration; this may be due to a more efficient carrier extraction behavior from the perovskite film to the CP.36 Interestingly, the PL peaks shift to the short-wavelength range, which shows that the Stokes shift decreases, and the non-radiative recombination is effectively suppressed.37,38 As shown in Fig. 2d, the films with the CP show faster photoluminescence decay than the pristine CsPbIBr2 film, which indicates an increased charge carrier transfer due to the presence of the CP.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted to investigate the interaction between the perovskite film and CP. The Pb 4f peak in the spectrum of the perovskite with the CP is shifted to higher binding energy (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the C 1s and O 1s peaks shift to lower binding energy (Fig. 3b and c). The Cs 3d, I 3d and Br 3d peaks show no significant movement in Fig. S4.† This indicates that during the interaction between the CsPbIBr2 perovskite and CP, due to electron transfer from the perovskite to the CP, the electron density of Pb decreases, while the electron density of the CO group in the CP increases.39 The UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) spectra were further recorded to reveal the change in the band-edge electronic structure of the CsPbIBr2 perovskite layer by the deposited CP. The binding energy onset (Eonset) and binding energy cutoff (Ecutoff) of the pristine CsPbIBr2 film and the CsPbIBr2/0.5 CP films are shown in Fig. 3d. The Fermi level (EF) changed from −3.66 eV to −3.55 eV, indicating that the CP inhibits the deep level defects on the surface of the CsPbIBr2 perovskite, and the energy band bends upward.40 The valence band maximum (Ev) of the pristine CsPbIBr2 film has shifted up 70 meV relative to the 0.5 CP film. This reduces the barrier between the CsPbIBr2 perovskite and HTL 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)-amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD), which is conducive to hole transport to Spiro-OMeTAD.41 We built the energy-level diagram in Fig. 3e. Based on the above characterization, as shown in Fig. 3f, the CP with electron-withdrawing groups ID and BIBDF balances uncoordinated Pb2+ and fills halogen vacancies on perovskite surfaces, thereby reducing surface defects, and the suitable upward bending of the band edge is favorable for hole transport from the CsPbIBr2 film to the HTL. This will be beneficial to improve the short-circuit current density (JSC) of solar cells.

To study the influence of the CP interface layer on the solar cell performance, we fabricated a planar n-i-p device with a configuration of FTO/c-TiO2/CsPbIBr2/CP interface layer/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au, as shown in the SEM cross-sectional image (Fig. 4a). The thickness of the CsPbIBr2 perovskite film is 280 nm. The PSCs without the CP interface layer were also prepared as control devices. It is worth noting that, although the CP and Spiro-OMeTAD were both dissolved in chlorobenzene, the process of Spiro-OMeTAD deposition did not remove the CP, as shown in Fig. S5.†Fig. 4b and Table 1 show the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best-performing devices and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. The control device exhibits a PCE of 8.92% with a VOC of 1.18 V, a JSC of 11.31 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 66.67%. The champion CsPbIBr2 PSC with the 0.5 CP interfacial layer achieves a PCE of up to 11.05% with a VOC of 1.19 V, a JSC of 12.69 mA cm−2, and a FF of 73.31%. The photovoltaic parameters of the high-efficiency CsPbIBr2 PSCs are shown in Table S1.† As shown in Fig. S6,† the statistical distribution of the PCE, VOC, JSC, and FF from 20 devices is displayed. With the concentration of the CP increasing, the average JSC and FF are enhanced significantly. When the CP concentration arrives at 0.5 mg mL−1, the JSC is increased from 10.95 mA cm−2 to 12.00 mA cm−2, and the FF is increased from 64.80% to 73.01%, indicating that the carrier transport is effectively strengthened. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and steady-state power outputs under bias at the maximum-power-point (MPP) are shown in Fig. 4c and d. The device with a 0.5 CP interface layer exhibits higher integrated current density and steady-state PCE, consistent with the result of the J–V curves. The hysteresis index (HI) defined by (PCEreverse − PCEforward)/PCEreverse of the CsPbIBr2/0.5 CP device is 7.9%, less than that of the control device (15.0%) in Fig. S7 and Table S2,† which indicates that the hysteresis effect of the device is weakened by the introduction of the CP interfacial layer at the perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD interface. However, the higher CP concentration is not beneficial to improve the PCE of the device. When the concentration of the CP exceeds 0.5 mg mL−1, the JSC and the PCEs decrease.

Furthermore, the carrier transport processes at the interface were demonstrated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterization in Fig. 5a. The fitting results are summarized in Table S3.† The semicircle in the high-frequency region reflects the charge transfer resistance (Rtr). The smaller the Rtr, the better the carrier transport, i.e., there is less nonradiative recombination of carriers in the devices. The series resistance (Rs) and Rtr were fitted according the equivalent circuit. The Rs values of control and 0.5 CP devices are 7.55 and 11.84 Ω, with no remarkable change, while the Rtr value decreases from 12698 to 2047 Ω, revealing that the CP layer significantly enhances carrier transfer from the perovskite layer to Spiro-OMeTAD.35,42 As shown in Fig. 5b, the dark J–V curves of the PSCs demonstrate a lower leakage current in the device with the CP layer, which means reduced defects by introducing the CP interface layer.43 The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) models of single-hole and single-electron devices were used to measure the trap state density of the devices without and with the 0.5 CP layer in Fig. 5c and d. The inflection point means all trap states will be filled with injected charges, so the point is denoted as the trap filled limit voltage (VTFL). The trap state density (ntrap) can be calculated with the following eqn (1):21,44 (1)where ε and ε0 are the dielectric constant of the perovskite and the vacuum permittivity, e is the charge of an electron, and L is the thickness of the perovskite film (280 nm), respectively.33 For the single-hole device, the VTFLs of the control and 0.5 CP are 1.40 and 0.92 V, respectively. The calculated trap densities of the control and 0.5 CP are 1.58 × 1016 cm−3 and 1.04 × 1016 cm−3. For the single-electron device, the VTFLs of the control and 0.5 CP are 2.03 and 1.75 V, respectively. The calculated trap densities of the control and 0.5 CP are 2.29 × 1016 cm−3 and 1.97 × 1016 cm−3. The trap densities of the single-carrier devices based on the CsPbIBr2/0.5 CP film are lower than those of the control film, indicating that defects are effectively suppressed. Currently, halogen vacancies, interstitials, and anti-site substitutions are commonly believed to be the main causes of internal defects in perovskite grains. These deep-level point defects lead to the non-radiative recombination of free electrons and holes.45 Herein, the CP with electron-withdrawing groups interacts with the surface of the CsPbIBr2 film and passivates the surface defects. Therefore, non-radiative recombination is reduced, and the efficiency of corresponding devices is significantly improved.

We performed the long-term stability test of the devices in air (Fig. 6a). Compared with the control device, the device with the CP exhibited superior stability. The 0.5 CP device without encapsulation retained about 91% of its initial value for nearly 900 hours, while the control device retained only 66% of its initial efficiency. Compared with other high-efficiency CsPbIBr2 PSCs (Table S4†), the target device with the 0.5 CP as the interface layer between CsPbIBr2 and Spiro-OMeTAD has better long-term stability in air. The improved device stability is mainly attributed to the improvement of hydrophobicity. In n-i-p type perovskite solar cells, Spiro-OMeTAD, the most commonly used hole material, is usually added with Li-TFSI and 4-tBP, which also further increases the instability caused by moisture.46,47 Because the CP has the special chemical structure of large aromatic rings and lactone groups, it has strong hydrophobicity. Therefore, the damage of the CsPbIBr2 film by moisture is reduced. As shown in Fig. 6b, the corresponding water contact angle of the perovskite films modified with the 0.5 CP was remarkably increased from 65.3° for the control perovskite film to 88.8°. After holding for one minute, the contact angle of the film with the 0.5 CP is still significantly larger than that of the control film (63.2° vs. 47.1°). The hydrophobicity of the perovskite film with the 0.5 CP is significantly improved, which is beneficial to the long-term stability of the device. Therefore, interface engineering plays an important role in stabilizing perovskites and improving the performance of solar cells.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate a self-assembled nanofibrillar CP film as an interface layer to optimize the energy level alignment, accelerate charge extraction, passivate the perovskite surface defects, and improve the hydrophobicity of perovskite films. Therefore the CsPbIBr2/CP device achieved an enhanced PCE of 11.05%, with a VOC of 1.19 V, a JSC of 12.69 mA cm−2, and a FF of 73.31%. By contrast, the control device showed a PCE of 8.92%, a VOC of 1.18 V, a JSC of 11.31 mA cm−2, and a FF of 66.67%. Moreover, the CsPbIBr2/CP device retained about 91% of its initial efficiency value in air for nearly 900 hours, while the control device retained only 66% of its initial efficiency. This work suggests an effective approach to not only increase the inorganic PSC performance but also improve the long-term stability of the device by the introduction of the CP interface layer.
