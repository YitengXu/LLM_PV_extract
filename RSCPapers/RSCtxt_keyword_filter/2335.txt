    , Accepted 12th February 2007First published on 9th March 2007AbstractThe influence of the crystal orientation in porous crystalline films of ZnO electrodeposited on the photoelectrochemical characteristics of the films is studied. For differently oriented ZnO thin films following removal of the respective structure-directing agent (SDA) and adsorption of a sensitiser, time-resolved photocurrent measurements, intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS), intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and current–voltage curves were measured in acetonitrile-based electrolytes containing I3−/I− as the redox electrolyte. The crystal orientation has a significant influence on the charge transport across such films and hence is reflected in the observed electrode kinetics. Films originally grown in the presence of, e.g., Coumarin 343 as a SDA, showed a significantly faster response to illumination. Increased electron diffusion coefficients and diffusion lengths were calculated from the results of IMPS and IMVS, caused by a faster electron movement in the films. Implications of these findings on further improvements of sensitised ZnO films prepared by electrochemical deposition are discussed.
Introduction
Dye-sensitised solar cells are looked upon as a possible candidate for the next generation of economic thin film photovoltaic cells and the research in this field is very active since more than 10% of the the conversion efficiency could be achieved at presumably low production costs and a widely sustainable technology.1 One of the key issues for this type of solar cells is to obtain porous nanocrystalline metal oxide semiconductor thin films.2 Aside from TiO2, ZnO is an attractive semiconductor in this respect since it can be grown under controlled structure and morphology, even in solution-based processes utilizing its precipitation at higher pH or oxidation of Zn films.3,4 Cathodic electrochemical deposition of ZnO in the presence of structure directing agents (SDA) such as Eosin Y (EY) in the deposition bath is one of the best ways to prepare porous crystalline nanostructured ZnO thin films.5–7 Such films can be prepared in one step and at low temperature of 70 °C on a wide variety of substrates. An accessible porous ZnO network is obtained after removing the SDA from the pores.8 Subsequently, a variety of sensitisers can be adsorbed in these pores from solution and electrodes of appreciable performance as photoelectrodes in dye-sensitised solar cells can be obtained.8–10 Since the SDA has a very direct influence of the film growth by adsorption to the growing ZnO crystals, the orientation of the ZnO thin film can be controlled by the choice of SDA, e.g., EY,7 sodium dodecyl sulfate11 or Coumarin 343 (C343).12 For instance, the c-axis of ZnO thin films is oriented perpendicular to the conductive substrate when the films are electrodeposited in the presence of EY, whereas a c-axis parallel to the substrate is obtained with C343 as SDA.12 For single crystals of ZnO an increased electron mobility perpendicular to the c-axis was observed earlier over a wide temperature range in measurements of the Hall effect.13 It is the task of this work to find out if the rotated crystal direction and hence increased electron mobility in the films deposited in the presence of C343 has an influence on the observed photoelectrochemical characteristics of the films. Such influence should be expected since electron transport in the porous semiconductor network is a decisive parameter in the overall electrode performance but considering the complex sequence of reaction steps a detailed kinetic analysis will be needed since such influence to our knowledge has not yet been detected for nanostructured dye-modified porous ZnO films.
Time resolved photocurrent measurements and experiments under modulated light intensity are appropriate means to discuss the interplay of charge movement and charge transfer reactions in a photoelectrochemical cell. In intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) the sample is illuminated with modulated light of a small ac component δ about 10% or less of the continuous illumination intensity. From a detailed analysis of the photocurrent amplitude and phase shift corresponding to this modulation, the electron transit time τD can be obtained, a measure for the average time an injected electron spends in the semiconductor network.14–16 In intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) the electrode potential is measured at open circuit and then the average lifetime τn for electrons can be determined which is limited by back transfer to the electrolyte. The effective diffusion constant of electrons in the semiconductor Dn can be determined14,17,18 when fitting the obtained photocurrent jphoto resulting from the incident photon flux I0 modulated at ω using the film thickness d, the absorption coefficient α of the electrode, the efficiency Φinj of electron injection, the elementary charge q and the value of τn obtained independently from IMVS with the analytic expression (1)and  derived earlier for this case,14 and considering further that the response will be effected by an RC attenuation term (2)in which R and C are the resistance and capacitance of the electrode, respectively.14 Since R and C close to short circuit are determined by the rather constant interfaces of substrate/semiconductor and substrate/electrolyte, 10 Ω
				≤
				R
				≤ 20 Ω and C ≅ 30 μF cm−2 are typical.14 Since the photocurrent measured in the external circuit is the result of a competition between electron diffusion and back transfer to the redox electrolyte, a good quantity to indicate the electrode performance is provided by an effective diffusion length  of injected electrons which should be larger than the film thickness in an efficient photoelectrode material.
In this study, we will discuss the photoelectrochemical characteristics obtained by current–voltage curves in the dark and under illumination, time-resolved photocurrent measurements, IMPS and IMVS at porous crystalline nanostructured ZnO thin films with different crystalline orientation that were prepared by electrochemical deposition in the presence of either EY or C343 as SDA. As sensitisers, we will use the same molecules for chemical compatibility. As main parameters, Dn and Ln will be determined and used to discuss the observed photovoltaic characteristics and further optimisation strategies.
Experimental
All films were prepared by cathodic electrodeposition on rotating (500 rpm) F-doped SnO2 on glass (Asahi Glass) from a 70 °C oxygen-saturated aqueous 5 mM ZnCl2, 0.1 M KCl solution at an applied potential of 1.0 V vs. SCE in the presence of either EY or C343 as SDA.8 After removal of the SDA from the electrodes in soft alkaline solution either EY or C343 was adsorbed as a sensitiser.8 The film thickness was determined by an Alpha-step profiler (Tencor Instruments), the dye content by optical absorption spectroscopy. Details of the film preparation and the structural characterisation will be reported elsewhere.12 In this paper we will abbreviate the studied electrode material by a sequence of “sensitiser”/ZnO“SDA” (e.g. EY/ZnOC343 for a ZnO film grown in the presence of C343 and then subsequently loaded with EY as a sensitiser). The photoelectrochemical characterisation was performed in a conventional three-electrode arrangement in a one compartment glass cell. A Pt wire was used as counter electrode and a Ag/AgNO3 electrode with acetonitrile (Roth, 99.9%) as internal solvent was used as a reference electrode. The reference potential was determined as 0.096 V vs. the ferrocene/ferricenium (Fluka, >98%) redox couple in acetonitrile. A 1:4 by volume mixture of acetonitrile (Roth, 99.9%, stored over molecular sieve 4 Å) with ethylene carbonate (Fluka, >99%) dissolving 0.5 M tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI, Sigma, 99%) and 0.05 M iodine (Scharlau, 99.8%) was used as electrolyte without further purification. The electrodes were attached with the ZnO/dye side to a sealed opening in the cell and illuminated from the glass backside. For time-resolved photocurrent measurements and intensity modulated measurements, a UV-LED (peak wavelength 400 nm) was used for pure ZnO, a blue LED (peak wavelength 470 nm) for C343 and a green LED (peak wavelength 520 nm) for EY as a sensitizer. The light intensity of the LEDs was adjusted to 15 mW cm−2. The current during time-resolved measurements was acquired by a Jaissle Bipotentiostat with a rise time of 100 μs connected to a Hameg HM 305 oscilloscope, which was triggered by a pulse generator connected to a controller to start data acquisition some microseconds before the LED-flash. The transients obtained by the oscilloscope were recorded by a personal computer using Hameg SP91-2 software.
IMPS measurements and IMVS measurements were performed in the same photoelectrochemical cell. LEDs were again used as light sources. Their modulation was generated by the function generator of a EG&G Model 7220 Lock-in amplifier and a Jaissle IMP 83 potentiostat to stabilise the signal and add a steady state dc component to avoid negative voltages at the LED. Additionally to the illumination by LED, bias white light of 100 mW cm−2 illuminated the electrode to provide an electron density in ZnO similar to the operation conditions of a prospective photovoltaic cell. This white light was supplied by using an OSRAM HLX64633 halogen lamp in a L.O.T.-Oriel LSH102 Lamp Housing. The obtained photocurrent amplitude correlated to the modulated light was registered by use of a Jaissle Bi-Potentiostat-Galvanostat and acquired by the lock-in amplifier. The photocurrent density (divided by elementary charge) was normalized to the incoming photon flux to provide Mag (photocurrent/photon flux).
The current–voltage characteristics were measured under simulated AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2) by use of a Bunko Keiki CEP-2000 solar simulator and a Nikko Keisoku potentiostat. Aside from the short-circuit photocurrent Isc and the open circuit photopotential Uoc, the fill factor ff was determined as the maximum electrical power density (mW cm−2) achievable compared to the product Isc times Uoc. The cell efficiency η was calculated as this maximum power density divided by the incident light density (100 mW cm−2).
Results and discussion
In Table 1, the data of average film thickness, d, determined by a stylus method, the sensitiser content determined by optical spectroscopy and the calculated values of the overall sensitiser concentration  and the concentration of the sensitiser on the inner electrode surface  are shown for thin films of C343/ZnOEY, C343/ZnOC343, EY/ZnOEY and EY/ZnOC343. Considering the overall sensitiser content and concentration it seems that both sensitisers adsorb more readily to the film of ZnO when EY was used as SDA, as opposed to the films where C343 was used as SDA. By BET measurements, however, it was found that films prepared in the presence of EY as SDA have a larger surface area of 121 cm2 cm−2 when compared to films prepared in the presence of C343 as SDA (26 cm2 cm−2).19 Normalisation of the sensitiser content to these experimental surface areas led to about double the surface concentration of both sensitisers in the films originally prepared in the presence of C343. Also it is seen that for a given surface area of the respective ZnO material, EY adsorbs to about double the surface concentration when compared with C343. The detailed characterisation of film growth and structure of such films will be reported separately since they deserve a more focussed discussion than possible in the present context.12

Time-resolved photocurrent measurements were carried out for the films to provide a direct comparison before any sensitisers were involved. The results for ZnOC343 and ZnOEY are compared under identical illumination conditions of the UV-LED in Fig. 1a. Both electrodes respond by the expected anodic photocurrents following interband excitation of electrons. The steady state photocurrent is reached within 10–20 ms, a time scale expected for the filling of electron traps. It is seen that ZnOC343 gives a significantly increased photocurrent at a shorter response time, already indicating more facile electron transport for ZnOC343 compared to ZnOEY. Since a shortened rise time can also be caused by an increased rate of trap filling at higher electron flux, the light intensity was adjusted in Fig. 1b to yield identical photocurrents in the steady state. Also, under these conditions, however, ZnOC343 showed a faster increase upon the beginning of illumination and faster decrease at the end of the LED flash, confirming faster electron transport in ZnOC343. These results were further confirmed by a shorter electron transit time τD = 1.1 ms for ZnOC343 compared to τD = 2.4 ms obtained from IMPS measurements performed with the UV-LED.
 Fig. 1  Time-resolved photocurrents measured at −0.2 V vs. Ag/Ag+ by using a UV LED for ZnOEY (solid line) and ZnOC343 (dashed line) (a) and under reduced illumination for ZnOC343 to yield a constant photocurrent in the steady state (b). 
Photocurrent transients for the sensitised films C343/ZnOC343 and C343/ZnOEY are shown in Fig. 2. From both films, a fast rise of the photocurrent was seen as the LED flash hit the electrode. No overshoots were observed and the photocurrents were found at a steady level. This almost rectangular response indicates that the excited electrons are collected efficiently in the external circuit with good regeneration of the oxidised sensitisers, since overshoots were also not detected at the end of the flash. Compared to the film with EY as SDA, the film with C343 as SDA showed a significantly faster increase and decrease of the photocurrents when switching the illumination on and off. The same principle characteristics were found also for the films EY/ZnOC343 and EY/ZnOEY. Again the film grown in the presence of C343 showed a significantly more rectangular response. It is thereby indicated that the faster response is caused by the semiconductor matrix independent of the sensitiser employed, caused by faster electron transport in ZnOC343 when compared to ZnOEY or a smaller number of electron traps in the films grown in the presence of C343 as SDA.
 Fig. 2  Time-resolved photocurrents measured at −0.2 V vs. Ag/Ag+ by using a blue LED for C343/ZnOEY (solid line) and C343/ZnOC343 (dashed line). 
IMPS and IMVS measurements were carried out to further investigate the photoelectrochemical properties of these films. IMPS measurements were carried out at an applied potential of −0.2 V vs. Ag/Ag+ to ensure a current collection saturated with respect to the potential, comparable to a short circuit photocurrent in a photovoltaic cell. IMVS was obtained at open circuit, as usual. For both IMPS and IMVS, a bias illumination was introduced to establish conditions similar to those of a prospective photovoltaic cell. Since both electron transit time τD (IMPS) and electron lifetime τn (IMVS) are effected by the electron concentration in the conduction band of the semiconductor, a steady state illumination is important to determine relevant characteristics of the electron movement in the electrodes. It is of particular importance for the IMVS measurements. As reported earlier, the recombination reaction of injected electrons with the redox electrolyte is dominated by the reaction via the conductive substrate at lower light intensity, whereas only at higher light intensity the reaction via the surface of the semiconductor takes over.20–22 From IMPS and IMVS measurements, τD and τn were determined for C343/ZnOC343 and C343/ZnOEY and plotted in Fig. 3 as a function of the modulated photon flux.16
 Fig. 3  Electron transit times τd and lifetimes τn for C343/ZnOEY (τd = ■, τn = ▲) and C343/ZnOC343 (τd = □, τn = △) at different light intensities. 
Caused by an increased steady state concentration of electrons in ZnO at higher photon flux and hence an increased trap occupancy the decreased trapping probability leads to an increased effective diffusion coefficient Dn and hence decreased τD because accessible deep traps are most likely filled and only shallow traps are able to retard electrons.23 The parallel decrease of τn, albeit determined at open circuit, is caused by an increased electron transfer rate for electrons trapped in energy levels at higher energy.24,25 From the plots in Fig. 3 it is seen that τn was found significantly higher than τD for both C343/ZnOC343 and C343/ZnOEY, a fundamental prerequisite for a successful transfer of the injected electron to the back electrode. The obtained values of τn and τD are both shorter than those determined for sensitised TiO2 films prepared by the sol-gel method,1,2,17,24 speaking for a faster movement of the electrons through the semiconductor matrix in the electrodeposited ZnO films. At the good ratio of τn/τD > 10 it can be assumed that almost all injected electrons can be collected efficiently before they recombine with the redox electrolyte.
When looked at in more detail and compared with C343/ZnOEY it is seen that a shorter electron transit time and a longer electron lifetime were measured in C343/ZnOC343, favourable for an efficient photoelectrode. Since these films were adjusted to almost identical film thickness in the preparation, the shorter electron transit time of C343/ZnOC343 indicates improved electron transport in the film with C343 as SDA. The longer electron lifetime in the film with C343 as SDA may appear surprising at first sight since it might be expected that the electrons that are moving faster in the ZnO matrix should have a higher probability at open circuit to recombine with the redox electrolyte. Obviously, however, the rate of electron back transfer is reduced, a very reasonable finding in view of the higher surface concentration of the sensitiser (Table 1) for ZnOC343. Significant blocking of the back electron transfer from the semiconductor to the electrolyte had also been reported for Ru-based sensitisers on TiO2 if a monolayer of sensitiser was formed.1,2 The more condensed layer of sensitiser molecules in the present case for electrodes prepared in the presence of C343 (see Table 1) seems to play the same favourable protective role for electrons in the conduction band of ZnO.
The complete fitting of the IMPS response (Fig. 4) with the film thickness d (measured by stylus method), the absorption coefficient α (calculated from the dye content α = εc ln 10 = 2.303 εc), the electron lifetime τn obtained from IMVS, and a typical value of R = 10 Ω as fixed parameters allowed to determine the electron diffusion coefficient Dn, the average injection yield of an electron from the excited state of the sensitisers to the conduction band of ZnO Φinj and the capacity C as fitting parameters. The results were obtained by fitting the experimental IMPS response with products of formulae (1) and (2). The examples of the fitting for C343/ZnOEY and C343/ZnOC343 are shown in Fig. 4. Dn, C and Φinj were determined by least-squares fits. This method provided well defined values of Dn
				± 5%, C
				± 7% and Φinj
				± 1%. In Fig. 4, the results of the fits also without RC attenuation are shown. Reasonable fits over the whole range of frequencies were only obtained if RC attenuation was included. Otherwise significant deviations appeared at frequencies above 300 Hz. Electron diffusion coefficients of Dn = 7.86 × 10−6 and Dn = 1.14 × 10−5 cm2 s−1 were obtained at a photon flux of 4.55 × 1014 photons cm−2 s−1 for C343/ZnOEY and C343/ZnOC343, respectively. Dn of the film with C343 as SDA is larger than for the film with EY as SDA proving a more efficient electron transport in ZnOC343 than in ZnOEY leading to the above results of a smaller τn for C343/ZnOC343. One reason for the faster diffusion has to be sought in the different crystal orientation of ZnO and hence the different relative orientation of the net electron pathway which is in all cases perpendicular to the film and electrode surface but hence parallel to the c-axis for ZnOEY and perpendicular to it for ZnOC343. Since a higher electron mobility was measured perpendicular to the c-axis of ZnO single crystals the observed higher effective electron diffusion constant perpendicular to the c-axis and hence in ZnOC343 makes perfect sense. Aside from this dependence of Dn on the electron mobility, however, the distribution of traps in the two different kinds of films will play a decisive role. It was seen in the photocurrent transients (Fig. 1 and 2) that the trap density in ZnOC343 is smaller than in ZnOEY, another argument clearly speaking for an increased Dn in ZnOC343 relative to ZnOEY. In spite of this higher Dn in ZnOC343, however, the observed values of the photocurrents normalised for the intensity of the modulated light jphoto/qδI0 in Fig. 4 are smaller for C343/ZnOC343 than for C343/ZnOEY. This is in part caused by a smaller sensitiser content in the film (Table 1) and hence decreased light harvesting efficiency of 48% in C343/ZnOC343 compared with 68% in C343/ZnOEY. In the fits this is considered in the value of α. A more fundamental difference is detected in a decreased quantum efficiency of the charge carrier injection following light absorption Φinj = 14.3% in C343/ZnOC343 compared with Φinj = 20.6% in C343/ZnOEY. Both values are clearly smaller than the value of Φinj = 1 often assumed in the fitting for dye-modified TiO2 or ZnO thin films prepared by the conventional sol-gel method.14,17 These decreased injection efficiencies in the present case must be caused by the increased surface concentration of C343. This leads to an increased probability of sensitiser molecules without close contact with the semiconductor and hence to a severely decreased probability of charge injection. Further, an increased tendency towards aggregate formation of the sensitisers opens non-radiative decay channels and thereby decreases the probability of charge injection into the conduction band of the semiconductor.

The dc photocurrent was (a) 0.15 mA cm−2 (b) 0.11 mA cm−2 during IMPS. As fitting parameter were used (a) photon flux: I0 = 4.55 × 1014 cm−2 s−1, diffusion coefficient: Dn = 7.86 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, lifetime: τn = 0.013 s, absorption coefficient: α = 5700 cm−1, film thickness: d = 2.2 μm, resistance: R = 10 Ω, capacitance: C = 35.1 μF, injection efficiency: Φinj = 0.206; (b) I0 = 4.55 × 1014 cm−2 s−1, Dn = 1.14 × 10−15 cm−2 s−1, τn = 0.022 s , α = 3600 cm−1, d = 2.0 μm, R = 10 Ω, C = 30.6 μF, Φinj = 0.143. 
In Table 2 the characteristics obtained from the IMPS data (Fig. 4) are summarized and compared to those obtained for EY as a sensitiser. Also with EY as sensitiser ZnOC343 shows improved characteristics in comparison to ZnOEY. The effective diffusion coefficient Dn is almost twice as high. Since, however, the electron lifetime is slightly decreased for EY/ZnOC343 compared with EY/ZnOEY, the average diffusion length is only a little bigger for EY/ZnOC343. For EY as a sensitiser the injection yields are significantly higher than for C343 as a sensitiser both for ZnOC343 and ZnOEY even at a generally higher surface concentration of the sensitiser. This speaks for a better anchoring of EY to the ZnO surface and a thereby enhanced rate of charge transfer or for a well suppressed aggregation quenching for EY, a big advantage for EY as a sensitiser molecule. For the highest sensitiser surface concentration in this study, however, in EY/ZnOC343, the injection efficiency is clearly decreased relative to EY/ZnOEY, the same trend as seen for C343/ZnOC343 compared with C343/ZnOEY. For all studied electrodes the injected carriers are almost all collected in the external circuit as indicated by the larger diffusion length Ln when compared to the average film thickness d, so loss reactions following injection were successfully suppressed, in ZnOC343 to an even higher extent than in ZnOEY. The obtained results suggest that improving the electron injection efficiency by optimizing the adsorption condition for C343 as a sensitiser will enhance the overall efficiency of these electrodes to a great extent since all injected electrons were collected in the external circuit. ZnOC343 can be optimized to an even larger extent since the diffusion length is large enough to allow successful extraction of a significantly increased electron concentration in the films, to be realised by more efficient sensitisation.

The effective diffusion constant of electrons in a given electrode depends on the level of trap filling since release from deep traps dominates Dn at small electron concentrations and more facile release from shallow traps dominates Dn at higher relative electron concentrations. Since the same redox electrolyte was used in all measurements and since differences in band bending caused by the two very similar sensitisers can be neglected in first approximation, the electron concentration in the ZnO electrode is directly correlated to the photovoltage, maximum under open circuit conditions. In Fig. 5, the obtained values of Dn are therefore plotted as a function of the measured photovoltage under different light intensity. The expected increase of Dn under increasing photon flux (increased photovoltage) was observed for all electrodes in this study, aside from EY/ZnOEY if all originally determined parameters were used for the fitting. Therefore α = 20 000 cm−1 had to be used instead of the experimental parameter α = 43 456 cm−1 to obtain consistent fits also in this case. The general qualitative observation of larger electron diffusion coefficients for ZnOC343 when compared with ZnOEY, however, was clearly preserved. Beyond this trend it is also observed that under comparable photon flux EY as a sensitiser consistently led to higher photovoltage than C343 as a sensitiser, even if differently oriented ZnO was used, consistent with the smaller injection yield obtained for C343 as a sensitiser (Table 2).
 Fig. 5  Effective electron diffusion coefficients Dn as the function of the photovoltage for C343/ZnOC343 (○), C343/ZnOEY (●), EY/ZnOC343 (△) and EY/ZnOEY (▲) obtained by fitting the IMPS response. Data were obtained for photon fluxes of 0.58, 1.09, 2.90, 4.55 and 5.68 (1014 cm−2 s−1) for C343 as sensitiser and of 0.76, 2.28, 3.53, 5.29 and 6.51 (1014 cm−2 s−1) for EY as sensitiser, same as in Fig. 2. The symbol (×) stands for the diffusion coefficient obtained for EY/ZnOEY assuming the original α = 43 456 cm−1 (see text). 
The collection of the photogenerated electrons depends on the competition between the desired diffusion to the back electrode and the parasitic recombination with the redox electrolyte. This competition can be expressed by the effective electron diffusion length Ln. The diffusion lengths for the films studied here were calculated using Dn and τn obtained from fits to the IMPS and IMVS data, respectively. They are shown in Fig. 6 as a function of the photocurrent established under steady state. The diffusion lengths in the studied examples are similar or larger than the average film thickness leading to complete collection of the photogenerated and injected electrons in the external circuit. Since the electron lifetime and the diffusion coefficient change oppositely with the electron concentration in the films, the electron diffusion length is only weakly dependent on the photon flux and hence the steady state photocurrent. Since larger diffusion coefficients were obtained for ZnOC343 than for ZnOEY and the electron lifetimes for those films were quite comparable, Ln in ZnOC343 was significantly larger than in ZnOEY. From these results it is concluded that ZnOC343 with its c-axis parallel to the electrode surface has improved electron transport properties when compared to ZnOEY with the c-axis perpendicular to the electrode surface. Improved photoelectrochemical characteristics can be expected for sensitised photoelectrodes with ZnOC343 as semiconductor matrix material.
 Fig. 6  Calculated diffusion lengths, Ln as the function of the dc photocurrent obtained from Dn and τn for C343/ZnOC343 (○), C343/ZnOEY (●), EY/ZnOC343 (△) and EY/ZnOEY (▲).The symbol (×) stands for the diffusion coefficient obtained for EY/ZnOEY assuming the original α = 43 456 cm−1 (see text). 
In the current–voltage characteristics under AM1.5 illumination conditions, however, these favourable electrode characteristics were not translated into increased efficiencies of ZnOC343 neither for EY nor C343 as sensitiser (Table 2). Quite comparable characteristics were observed leading to an overall efficiency of 0.6–0.8% for C343 as sensitiser and of about 1.3% for EY as sensitiser. Although electron transport in ZnOC343 was found considerably faster, this advantage was compensated by a decreased injection yield. When looked at in detail, almost constant products of injection yield and effective electron diffusion constant were found for ZnOC343 and ZnOEY for a given sensitiser. Increased injection yields therefore have to be aimed at for ZnOC343 to fully utilise the improved electron transport characteristics. To reach this aim, the inner surface area of ZnOC343 has to be increased, a request to be answered by a careful further optimisation of the deposition conditions of ZnOC343.
Conclusions
Transient and intensity-modulated photoelectrochemical experiments revealed decreased recombination reactions and increased effective electron diffusion coefficients and diffusion lengths for ZnO electrodeposited in the presence of Coumarin 343 as structure-directing agent (ZnOC343) when compared with the hitherto optimized electrode material electrodeposited in the presence of Eosin Y as SDA (ZnOEY). Characteristic differences were found for pure ZnO films and for those sensitised with either Eosin Y or Coumarin 343. It was thereby indicated that ZnO thin films show improved electron transport and hence collection efficiency when the c-axis is parallel to the substrate as opposed to a perpendicular orientation, in line with earlier mobility measurements at single crystals. In the present experiments, however, this advantage of ZnOC343 was not fully utilised since quite similar photovoltages, photocurrents and hence cell efficiencies were obtained for ZnOC343 and ZnOEY for a given sensitiser. The improved electron transport characteristics in ZnOC343 were compensated by a lower injection yield found for both sensitisers on ZnOC343 relative to the situation on ZnOEY. Such decreased injection yield was correlated with the increased surface concentration of both sensitisers on ZnOC343 as a consequence of the decreased surface area of ZnOC343 compared with ZnOEY. An increased relative surface area should therefore be aimed at for ZnOC343 to increase the injection yield. Also, an increased film thickness which could further contribute to an increased sensitiser load and hence improved light harvesting could easily be tolerated in view of the increased diffusion length. Such optimisation should allow to fully utilise the improved electron transport characteristics in ZnOC343.
