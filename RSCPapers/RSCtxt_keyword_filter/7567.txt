    , Accepted 31st August 2020First published on 7th October 2020AbstractThe morphology of methylammonium lead iodide MAPbI3, formed by a two-step method with non-stoichiometric, excessive PbI2 concentration for a high carrier lifetime is reported. Through this excessive PbI2 alteration, the morphology, crystallinity, and carrier lifetime are purposely optimized. When the PbI2 concentration was 0.5 g ml−1, the nanotubes started to appear and were mixed with perovskite thin film, which yielded a significant average value of an effective carrier lifetime of 14.1 μs, resulting from the microwave photoconductivity decay on the perovskite prepared from the optimized method. The local value of effective carrier lifetime even reached above 60 μs at several locations. When the PbI2 concentration reached 0.6 g ml−1, synthetic perovskites contained bundles of nanotubes. This study provides a new framework for optimizing perovskites with appropriate surplus PbI2 and offers a scalable pathway for fabricating the perovskite material for best solar conversion efficiency.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites have been considered potential materials for new generation of solar cells, thanks to the facile process, reproducible fabrication, and outstanding photovoltaic properties.1 Remarkably, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells was recorded as 25.2% in 2020.2 The well-known formula of perovskite has so far been that of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), due to its attractive absorption coefficient of 1.5 × 104 cm−1 at 550 nm and benefits of the large bandgap of 1.5 eV.3 This bandgap can also be tuned by substituting organic ions, as well as halide anions, in its composition, and allows exploration of promising optoelectronic properties and the capability of endurance of the resulting photovoltaic materials. Following this strategy, organic ions, such as MA, and iodide anion were replaced by formamidinium (FA)4,5 and chlorine/bromine,6,7 respectively. The PCE of perovskite solar cells of more than 20% was recorded with perovskites using mixed organic ions and mixed halides, MAyFA1−yPbBrxI3−x.8,9 It revealed that the molar ratio between organic ions and halides exerted a tremendous effect on the final performance of synthetic perovskites.10 For a given perovskite, the precise control of the stoichiometry is a crucial factor.11 The use of non-stoichiometric precursors for perovskite fabrication has been exploited previously. The addition of up to 20% molar excess PbI2 in the perovskite layer has been demonstrated to enhance the performance of perovskite solar cells, thanks to the improvement of crystallinity and enhancement of the carrier exchange.12 The residual PbI2 remaining after the incomplete perovskite conversion plays an important role in enhancing the PCE due to its capability for self-passivation at interfaces8,13 and between crystal grains of the perovskite.14 However, surplus addition of PbI2 diminished the cell performance due to non-uniformity of poorly crystallized perovskites that were synthesized under surplus PbI2.13 It is obvious that the employment of an appropriate excess quantity of PbI2 is beneficial for the enhancement of PCE of perovskites.15
To provide an additional framework for perovskite fabrication with excessive quantity of PbI2, the morphology and carrier lifetime measured by the microwave photo-conductivity decay (μPCD) of each resulting perovskite is reported in this contribution. This study revealed that the perovskite morphology, as well as the carrier lifetimes varied with the PbI2 concentration. The perovskite morphology transformed from crystal thin films (2D) to 1D nanostructures on increasing the PbI2 concentration from 0.4 to 0.6 g ml−1. The carrier lifetimes obtained were strongly dependent on the perovskite morphology and residual PbI2. With the appropriate excess quantity of PbI2, the effective carrier lifetime is recorded at 14.1 μs at an injection level of 2.5 × 1013 cm−3.
2. Experiment
The 3D structure of perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 was fabricated by a two-step spin-coating technique. Firstly, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 g PbI2 (trace metal 99.99%, Wako) was dissolved in 5 ml N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (Wako) and the CH3NH3I solution was formed by dissolving 0.3 g CH3NH3I (MAI) (Wako) in 5 ml 2-propanal; all samples were stirred in a glovebox overnight. Then, 50 μl of each PbI2 solution was spun at 1000 rpm for 15 s on the glass, followed by annealing treatment at 70 °C for 15 min under an inert gas atmosphere. After that, 50 μl of MAI was dropped onto each sample at the same annealing temperature for 15 min, and all of the samples were annealed at 100 °C for 15 min to obtain the synthetic 1D perovskites.
The geometry and elements of perovskite were observed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, JEOLJSM-7001F) integrated with Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS). All samples were observed at the center of the sample. The crystallinity of the synthetic perovskites was evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Brüker Discover D8) with Cu Kα radiation, where θ–2θ scan and grazing incidence (GI) techniques were used. The effective carrier lifetime measurements of perovskites were obtained by the microwave photo-conductivity decay (μPCD) method (KOBELCO, LTA1512EP) under different injection levels. The μPCD is widely used for the evaluation of photovoltaic materials, based on the determination of the time decay of the excess carriers generated by irradiated photons.16,17 The excess carriers in a sample are generated by a laser pulse, which changes its conductivity. The conductivity change is sensed by the change in the microwave reflectivity of the sample. The reflected power is dependent on the conductivity, thickness, and depth of penetration of the microwave energy impinging on the samples. In this experiment, a 5 ns laser pulse with a wavelength of 349 nm was used to generate excess carrier density. The laser with a wavelength of 349 nm (1.63 eV) gives an absorption depth in MAPbI3 with the order of 300–400 nm.18 Samples were measured at varied excitation photon density levels of 2.5 × 1013, 5.0 × 1013, and 1.0 × 1014 cm−3. The microwave generation of the system consists of a Gunn diode, which operates in the Ka-band of 26 GHz. The microwave area was split into two parts with an area of 5 × 10 mm2 for each part. The laser spot of 2 mm was irradiated on one part and the signal from this part was taken as the measured signal. The signal from another part without laser irradiation was taken as the reference signal. The results of the carrier lifetime measurements are from the difference between two signals. For carrier lifetime mapping, the measurements were taken on the horizontal axis (−4,4) and the vertical axis (−4,4), with an injection level of 2.5 × 1013 cm−3. Carrier lifetime measurement at other points (0,0), (0,3), (0,−3), (3,0) and (−3,0) were also taken into account with three injection levels. The unit was 1 millimeter. The results used in the manuscript were obtained from the average values of the measured carrier lifetimes.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characteristics of the high-excess PbI2
Low-concentrations of PbI2 in DMF (2 g/5 ml) are completely dissolved in DMF. On the other hand, PbI2 is not dissolved completely when its concentration in DMF greater than 2.5 g/5 ml [Fig. S1, ESI†] and produces a white precipitate in DMF. Each solution was stirred overnight before the spin-coating process, which is favorable for dropping the solvent on a glass substrate. For convenience, the PbI2 concentration in DMF is described as 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 g ml−1, corresponding to the PbI2 weight of 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 g in 5 ml DMF. Fig. 1 shows the SEM and digital images of all PbI2 thin films formed by using different amounts of PbI2 powder after the spin-coating process, followed by annealing at 70 °C. The morphology of PbI2 thin-film varied with different concentrations of PbI2 in DMF. When the PbI2 concentration in DMF was 0.4 g ml−1, the PbI2 thin film exhibited a branching geometry, which was the same as the conventional morphology of perovskite [Fig. 1a].19 When the PbI2 concentration was 0.5 g ml−1, the product contained a mixture of nanotubes [Fig. 1b] and these 1D structures tend to be separated at the PbI2 concentration of 0.6 g ml−1 [Fig. 1c]. The insets of Fig. 1b–c reveal the needle-like crystals with dark yellow color obtained when the PbI2 concentration was greater than 0.5 g ml−1, and this observation is similar to other reports.20–22Fig. 1d shows the XRD curves of spin-coated PbI2 with different concentrations. All films showed a strong diffraction peak at 12.6°, corresponding to the (001) lattice plane of the crystallized PbI2. Other peaks at 25.5, 38.6 and 52.3° are relative to the planes (002), (003) and (004), respectively.23,24 Through single-crystal XRD analysis, it was revealed that one DMF molecule was coordinated to Pb to form the one-dimensional structures of PbI2·DMF along the a-axis;21 the bonding between the adjacent molecular layers of PbI2 is weak. As a result, organic guests, such as DMF, can intercalate into the PbI2 interlayer space, which can result in the coprecipitation of the PbI2·DMF complex.25–27 It has been reported that the lattice of PbI2 expanded more than 30% due to the intercalation of DMF. However, PbI2·DMF is not very stable due to the weak interactions between DMF and PbI2. Consequently, DMF was gradually released from PbI2·DMF during the annealing treatment at 70 °C.27

3.2. Characteristics of the MAPbI3 Perovskites formed by high excess of PbI2
MAI in 2-propanol was dropped on all the PbI2 films that were formed by the spin-coating technique to form the perovskite MAPbI3. With the given quantities of MAI, the molar ratios PbI2/MAI were 2.3, 2.9, and 3.4, corresponding to the PbI2 concentrations of 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 g ml−1, respectively. It is worth noting that spin-coating was not used with 2-isopropanol-based MAI. Therefore, the perovskite was formed only by the interactions between MAI and DMF-based PbI2, which were relevant to the evaporation of MAI precursors, the surface tension of the MAI precursor on glass, and the reactions of ions. This explains why the morphology of this film is not as smooth as the films prepared by spinning on the FTO substrate [Fig. S3, ESI†]. The MAI was dropped to avoid the loss of MAI solvent during the spin-coating process, and it drives the reaction between PbI2 and MAI to completion in a controllable manner.
In the beginning, the yellow color of PbI2·DMF quickly changed to dark brown on annealing at 70 °C. However, the perovskites synthesized with the PbI2 concentration of 0.6 g ml−1 turned back to a yellow color after a while because of the appearance of the intermediate phase during annealing treatment at 70 °C.20,28,29 Petrov et al. demonstrated that the intermediate phase-like (MA)2(DMF)2Pb3I8 crystalline phase formed with a higher PbI2 concentration decomposed into two phases, MAPbI3 and PbI2, after thermal treatment at 80 °C. The ratio of the XRD peak intensity of PbI2 and MAPbI3 increased with increasing annealing time.23,30 After annealing treatment at 100 °C, all the samples became dark brown [inset of Fig. 2a–c]. The color change indicated the substitution of the DMF molecules in PbI2·DMF by MAI since the donor ability of I in MAI is stronger than DMF. As mentioned above, the PbI2·DMF is not very stable due to the weak interactions between DMF and PbI2. As a consequence, MAI is easily intercalated into PbI2·DMF. The lattice volume was known to increases by about 2.1 times when PbI2 was converted into MAPbI3 through this ionic intercalation.31 However, there were still some areas with yellow color at the corners of the sample prepared with the PbI2 concentration of 0.5 g ml−1, which demonstrated the incomplete conversion of the precursors into MAPbI3. With the higher PbI2 concentration of 0.6 g ml−1, the remaining residual PbI2 increased and rested underneath the film. The perovskites became darker with increasing PbI2 concentration, which demonstrated that the conversion into perovskites occurred more strongly at higher PbI2 concentrations. It is impossible to determine how much PbI2 was converted into MAPbI3 since PbI2 can still be formed in perovskite films depending on the annealing temperatures and concentrations of the precursors. In short, increasing the PbI2 concentration leads to strong conversion from PbI2 into MAPbI3 but it leaves a high concentration of residual PbI2 underneath. For this reason, refining this synthesis to achieve perovskites exhibiting supercarrier lifetimes is challenging but it should be achievable.

The insets are optical images of all perovskites. (d) XRD of all perovskites formed by 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 g ml−1 of PbI2 spun at 1000 rpm for 15 s, followed by thermal annealing treatment at 70 °C for 15 min, respectively. 
Interestingly, the morphologies of all synthetic perovskites are drastically different. The SEM images show that the resulting perovskites did not fully cover the glass substrate while using the PbI2 concentration of 0.4 g ml−1 [Fig. 2a]. The morphology looks like a thin-film with high roughness, which may be composed of various crystal grains. On increasing the concentration to 0.5 g ml−1, the surface coverage of perovskite improved and the morphology of the perovskites seemed to be a group of thin-films mixed with nanotubes [Fig. 2b]. The nanotubes tend to be separated and were observed with the PbI2 concentration of 0.6 g ml−1 [Fig. 2c]. The SEM images of the surfaces of perovskite films were taken. The morphology determined by SEM matched the resulting perovskite. The morphologies of all the synthetic perovskites are strongly dependent on the ratios of MAI/DMF/PbI2, as well as experimental conditions such as annealing temperature, annealing time and other environmental conditions. At a given quantity of DMF, the MAI concentration determines the structures of the nanowires.30,32 On increasing the PbI2 concentration further, the ratio of PbI2 and MAI gradually increased, which led to the appearance of the one-dimensional structure. These results are consistent with other reports.30,32 Park et al. stated that the formation of MAPbI3 nanowires is attributed to the appropriate aprotic solvents, e.g., DMF.32 Yan et al. reported that the one-dimensional structures were formed by colloid growth due to overlapping planes of PbI2 in the (100) direction.30 When MAI is dropped on DMF-based PbI2, the MAI is selectively intercalated with the PbI2·DMF at the edge of this (001) plane, thanks to excellent connections on these sites.23,30 The selective coordination of MAI caused the formation of one-dimensional structures, which were packed on the (001) plane, and linked together in the form of nanowire bundles by the sharing of halogen atoms.23,30 With higher concentrations of PbI2, MAI is easily coordinated with PbI2 and one-dimensional structures with smaller diameters will be formed. With the concentration of 0.7 g ml−1, the perovskite morphology is a bundle of nanotubes comprised of some multi-nanowires [Fig. S2, ESI†]. The fabrication of perovskite with different excess PbI2 concentrations was also carried out on FTO and similar results were also observed [Fig. S3, ESI†]. This confirmed the fabrication of 1D perovskite-like nanotubes or nanowires using highly excessive PbI2 concentrations, which may be applied on any type of substrate with no significant changes in the procedure or the morphologies of the synthetic products. Furthermore, 1D photovoltaic devices can be fabricated.

Fig. 2d shows the XRD spectra with diffraction angles from 10° to 60° of all prepared perovskites. The diffraction peaks of the tetragonal perovskite films synthesized from the pre-deposited PbI2 layers were observed at 2θ values of 14.06° (110), 28.44° (220) and 31.86° (310).23,24,28 The diffraction peaks were only found at the 2θ value of 19.79° (112) with perovskites formed by a higher concentration of 0.5 g ml−1. The changes in the XRD peaks from different perovskites revealed that there was no difference in the crystal structure of the perovskite, even though the morphology varied, which may be due to different crystal growing motifs furnished by different concentration gradients.33 The signature peak of PbI2 at 12.6° was observed with samples prepared from all PbI2 concentrations of 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 g ml−1 owing to the incomplete consumption of PbI2 in an inert gas atmosphere. This peak was observed with the PbI2 concentration of 0.6 g ml−1. The XRD peaks of PbI2 (002) were also seen for perovskites formed by the PbI2 concentration of 0.6 g ml−1. It confirmed that the conversion of PbI2 into the perovskite through the two-step treatment with MAI leaves an unexpectedly small percentage of unconverted PbI2 precursors, especially with highly excessive PbI2 concentration.
The elemental analysis of the film by EDS revealed the existence of the expected elements for all perovskites [Fig. S4, ESI†]. Small amounts of O were also detected, probably related to adsorbed water during measurements [Table 1]. The C element had the highest concentration in all perovskites. The increase in the ratio of PbI2/MAI led to ultra-thin perovskite nanowires.

3.3. Carrier lifetimes of MAPbI3 perovskites
To evaluate the perovskite quality, the measurement of carrier lifetimes is considered as one of most important criteria for the fabrication of solar cells. The measurement of carrier lifetime mapping was carried out through μPCD with a wavelength of 394 nm, frequency of 26 GHz and injection level of 2.5 × 10−13 cm−3 [Fig. 3]. The μPCD measurements were also carried out with PbI2 under the same conditions but no signal was obtained. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the decay curve extracted from the injection level of 2.5 × 10−13 cm−3; the signal extracted from μPCD measurement is not seen. Fig. 3a shows the mapping of carrier lifetimes by μPCD extracted from perovskites formed by 0.4 g ml−1. The effective carrier lifetimes on average is about 0.024 μs with a standard deviation of 0.018 μs [Fig. 3d]. This value is comparable to those measured by time-resolved photoluminescence.12,34 The effective carrier lifetimes aggregated around the value of 0.005 μs, which a limitation of the facility. This can be due to poor coverage of the perovskite crystal grains on the glass. With the PbI2 concentration of 0.5 g ml−1, the effective carrier lifetimes drastically increased to 14.1 μs with a standard deviation of 1.54 μs [Fig. 3b]. The mode of the data was around 11.8 μs. Some exceptional values were surprisingly recorded at 64 μs. The significant increase in the effective carrier lifetimes of such perovskites may come from their morphology, where the one-dimensional nanostructures start to appear as the 1D structure effectively furnishes charge transfer pathways as compared to other types of morphology. With the PbI2 precursor concentration higher than 0.6 g ml−1, the effective carrier lifetimes abruptly decreased, which were reported at 0.175 μs with a standard deviation of 0.028 μs. The decrease in the effective carrier lifetime can be due to the existence of residual PbI2 after the incomplete conversion into perovskite. Fig. 3e shows the decay curves extracted from μPCD measurements of all perovskites. For all samples, a quick-rising signal was obtained due to the formation of mobile charges. It decayed as a function of time after irradiation, which can be associated with the decreasing concentration of mobile carriers due to carrier recombination. With the PbI2 concentration of 0.5 g ml−1, the decay occurred slowly, whereas the decay occurred rapidly with the PbI2 concentrations of 0.4 g ml−1 and 0.6 g ml−1. As mentioned above, the obtained carrier lifetimes using μPCD are dependent on the conductivity, thickness of the samples, and irradiated photons. The time decay of excess carriers can be observed through the detection of the reflected microwave intensity, whose decay curve can be analyzed for the estimation of the carrier lifetime. It is noted that the carrier lifetimes extracted from the decay curve are validated despite the starting point of decay time. For each different sample, the decay curve obtained is different and the extracted carrier lifetimes are also varied. The delay time can be due to the interaction of excess carriers with grown samples or the impinging microwaves in the sample. When excess carriers were injected into a semiconductor, various recombination mechanisms occurred before the system went back to equilibrium.

(d) Average effective carrier lifetimes at the injection level of 2.5 × 1013 cm−3 for all perovskites. (e) Decay curves of perovskites at the injection level of 2.5 × 1013 cm−3. 
Time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) is a transient technique of μPCD, which involves microwave absorption to probe the charge carrier dynamics in perovskites.35–37 Normally, TRMC is used for evaluating the carrier lifetime of perovskite. Similarly, TRMC can be used to reveal the total mobility and carrier lifetimes of induced excess carriers. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) is normally combined with TRMC to evaluate the panoramic picture of carrier lifetimes. While TRPL probes only radiative recombination close to the surface, TRMC probes all mobile carriers formed within the crystal. Yu Bi et al. revealed the similar carrier lifetimes of 15 μs using time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) at an excitation wavelength of 845 nm with single crystal CH3NH3PbI3.35 It stated that the strong decay at lower wavelength is due to high recombination by exceeding the photoinduced charge carrier concentration in crystals and high recombination at the surface. Using the kinetic model,36 it also revealed a very low trap concentration of 1.5 × 1013 cm−3.35 The electron diffusion length was 0.8 μm, which increased to 8 μm just above the trap concentration. For the holes, the diffusion length reached a maximum value of 50 μm, which is attributed to the slow recombination with trapped electrons. While conduction band electrons exceed the number of electron traps by using higher excitation intensities, charge carrier decay kinetics are typically dominated by band-to-band recombination. Another report revealed that electron–hole recombination is very slow and the carrier lifetime reached a time scale of tens of μs.37
The density of perovskite coated on the glass substrate also affects the carrier lifetime. Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the mapping of carrier lifetimes of perovskite formed by 0.5 g ml−1 PbI2 spun at 4000 rpm for 15 s. The average effective carrier lifetime was recorded at 1.53 μs with a standard deviation of 0.841 μs. On increasing the velocity of the spin-coating process, the density of perovskite formed by the PbI2 concentration of 0.5 g ml−1 decreased, causing the perovskites to not fully cover the glass. As a consequence, the effective carrier lifetime decreased.

Fig. 4 shows the relationship of effective carrier lifetimes with injection levels of 2.5 × 1013, 5 × 1013 and 1 × 1014 cm−3. Interestingly, the effective carrier lifetimes extracted from perovskite formed by 0.4 g ml−1 PbI2 increased with increasing injection level, whereas the effective carrier lifetimes decreased with increasing injection levels for perovskite formed by PbI2 concentrations of 0.5 g ml−1 and 0.6 g ml−1. In particular, the carrier lifetime abruptly dropped from 14.1 μs, with irradiated carriers of 2.5 × 1013 cm−3, to 0.18 μs with irradiated carriers of 5 × 1013 cm−3. The possible explanations are that the perovskite formed by the PbI2 concentration of 0.4 g ml−1 possessed the least residual PbI2, which is much lower than the irradiated carriers. It also revealed a very low trap concentration of single crystal CH3NH3PbI3 of 1.5 × 1013 cm−3.35 The kinetic model of TRMC revealed the carrier lifetimes of electrons and holes in single-crystal perovskites. When the excess carriers are lower than the trap concentration (<1.5 × 1013 cm−3), the electron lifetime is much shorter than the hole lifetime.35 When this perovskite is irradiated with photons, the effective carrier lifetimes will increase with the increasing flux of photons. In contrast, when the concentration of residual PbI2 was higher than the irradiated carriers, the effective carrier lifetime decreased with increasing injection levels. The perovskites formed by PbI2 concentrations of 0.5 g ml−1 and 0.6 g ml−1 demonstrated this effect. In short, when the number of photogenerated carriers is greater than the number of trap states, both the electron and hole lifetimes are reduced and dominated by second-order recombination rates. This depicts that the carrier lifetimes are highly dependent on the excitation energy.

There is some debate in the literature about the detrimental effect of the remaining PbI2 in the perovskite film. With the appropriate excess concentration of PbI2, the performance of perovskite solar cells improved.12,15,34,38 The beneficial factor of residual PbI2 is due to the self-passivation of PbI2 at the interfaces8,13 or between the crystal grains of the perovskite.14 For PbI2-deficient conditions, the performance of perovskites dropped due to the accumulation of organic species in the grain boundaries, which prevents the carriers from being transported to the electrodes.38 With a too-high excess of PbI2 precursor concentration, the performance of perovskites abruptly decreases due to the poor formation of crystals of various morphologies.13 It is typical to select the appropriate PbI2 concentrations for perovskite fabrication. In this contribution, the morphology, as well as the carrier lifetime, is varied with the corresponding PbI2 concentration:
– With the PbI2 concentration of 0.4 g ml−1, the morphology of the resulting perovskite is the thin-film, which does not completely cover the glass substrate [Fig. 5a]. The effective carrier lifetime obtained is modest due to the inhomogeneous deposition of perovskite on the glass substrate. With such low PbI2 concentrations, the residual PbI2 remaining after incomplete conversion is much less than the irradiated photons, which makes their carrier lifetime increase with increasing injection levels.
 Fig. 5  Schematic of perovskites formed by PbI2 concentrations of (a) 0.4 g ml−1; (b) 0.5 g ml−1 and (c) 0.6 g ml−1. 
– With a PbI2 concentration of 0.5 g ml−1, the perovskite nanowires appeared and the morphology of the resulting perovskite was a mixture of nanowires and thin film [Fig. 5b]. The carrier lifetime obtained was recorded as more than 10 μs, thanks to (1) the formation of uniform 1D nanostructure perovskite MAPbI3, (2) the capability for the passivation of residual PbI2 remaining on the resulting perovskite, and (3) the residual PbI2 remaining being much less than the resulting perovskite.
– With the PbI2 concentration of 0.6 g ml−1, the perovskite morphology is a one-dimensional nanostructure. However, too much excess PbI2 concentration leaves a high residual PbI2 concentration after the incomplete conversion into perovskites; the remaining PbI2 is then considered as an insulating material between boundaries to prevent the exchange of carriers [Fig. 5c]. They are considered as the main cause of the decrease in the carrier lifetimes. Increasing PbI2 concentration will lead to the formation of smaller nanowires, which result from dividing larger nanowires.
It was found that such PbI2-excess perovskites had n-doped layers and a high level of defects.33,39 Several strategies have been developed to address the residual PbI2 remaining after perovskite conversion by solvent/vapor post-annealing treatment with γ-butyrolactone,40 tetra-nbutylammonium triiodide,41 phenylhydrazinium iodide,42 methylamine43 and mixed solvents of DMF and DMSO.44 This method not only allows unreacted PbI2 to be completely converted into perovskite, it also improves the grain boundary, which promotes the significant increase of the carrier lifetime.
4. Conclusion
The morphologies and characteristics of synthetic MAPbI3 perovskites were varied in correspondence with each excess PbI2 concentration. Increasing the PbI2 concentration strongly promoted the perovskite conversion on the surface. It led the morphology of MAPbI3 perovskite to be divided into one-dimensional nanostructures when the PbI2 concentration was much higher than the given MAI concentration. The self-assembly fabrication of one-dimensional nanostructured perovskite was successful by using highly excessive PbI2 precursors in a non-stoichiometric fashion. The perovskite nanotubes were formed with the PbI2 concentration of 0.6 g ml−1. With the PbI2 concentration of 0.7 g ml−1, the majority of the perovskite nanotubes were complemented by ultra-thin perovskite nanowires. The carrier lifetimes obtained by μPCD are associated with the MAPbI3 perovskite morphology and the remaining residual PbI2 after the incomplete conversion of PbI2 into MAPbI3. Interestingly, the perovskite formed by the excess PbI2 concentration of 0.5 g ml−1 yielded a record of effective carrier lifetimes more than 10 μs, with some local values of up to 64 μs. The employment of a high excess of PbI2 concentration diminished the carrier lifetimes because of the high concentration of the residual PbI2. This study provides an additional framework for the field of perovskites and can help in the optimization of future perovskite materials. The plan will focus on analyzing the complete conversion of PbI2 into 1D perovskites and applying these 1D perovskites for the fabrication of photovoltaic devices.
