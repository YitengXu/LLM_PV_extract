In this work, we report an enhanced ferroelectric photovoltaic effect in a semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube (S-SWCNTs)/ferroelectric BiFeO3 (BFO) heterostructure. A wide range of light absorption was possible in this structure owing to the low bandgaps of the S-SWCNTs (0.2–2.1 eV) and BFO (2.2–2.7 eV). The heterostructure also enabled efficient charge separation owing to the strong built-in electric field resulting from the synergic effect of the formation of p–f–n junctions (p-type S-SWCNTs/ferroelectric (f) BFO/n-type Nb:SrTiO3) and the introduction of a polarization-mediated internal field in the ferroelectric BFO layer. Compared with a single-layer device (Pt/BFO/Nb:SrTiO3), the heterostructure device (Pt/S-SWCNTs/BFO/Nb:SrTiO3) exhibited substantial enhancement of the photovoltaic performance. The open-circuit photovoltage and short-circuit photocurrent density reached up to 0.23 V and −7.52 mA cm−2 (corresponding to a photo-conversion efficiency of 4.40%) under one-sun illumination, respectively, after optimization of the ferroelectric layer thickness and appropriate interfacial band alignment. Moreover, by applying switchable electric polarization, this heterostructure could be tuned, enabling the development of controllable photovoltaic devices. Our findings demonstrate that the synergistic integration of materials with different functionalities is a promising approach for the design of photovoltaic devices with tunable performance.
Introduction
Visible-light photoconductivity at zero bias in photovoltaic devices is a fundamental phenomenon involving the generation and separation of photocarriers1–4 that is promoted by wide-range light absorption in the constituent materials and a strong built-in electric field at junction interfaces.5,6 These processes are generally limited by the charge-carrier transport properties of the constituent materials and are governed by the electronic band structure of the junction. Therefore, the synergistic integration of heterostructures with different bandgap energies and control of the interface properties and tunable functionalities are promising approaches to realize efficient photovoltaic devices with high photocurrent, voltage, and quantum efficiency.7–9
Recently, the emergence of visible-light-absorbing ferroelectrics, including [KNbO3]1−x[BaNi0.5Nb0.5O3−δ]x (Eg = 1.1–3.8 eV),10,11 KBiFe2O5 (1.6 eV),12 Bi2FeCrO6 (1.5–2.7 eV),13 LaCoO3-doped Bi4Ti3O12 (2.65 eV),14 and BiFeO3 (2.2–2.7 eV),15–18 has induced a resurgence of interest in ferroelectric photovoltaics as promising devices for solar-energy conversion,19–22 self-powered photodetection,23–25 and photoferroelectric memory.26 Most recently, Yang et al. reported the enhancement of photovoltage16 and photocurrent17 for a single BiFeO3 photovoltaic device by a novel configuration design and the heating effect, which demonstrates the feasibility of BiFeO3 based photovoltaic devices serve as candidates for the self-powered electronic applications. Interestingly, these semiconducting ferroelectrics exhibit a substantial zero-bias photocurrent that is generated parallel to the ferroelectric polarization direction under illumination and is reversibly switchable with polarization flipping upon the application of an electric field (the so-called switchable photovoltaic effect).27,28 In addition, the anomalous photovoltaic effect (i.e., open-circuit photovoltages larger than the bandgap) can be generated as a result of the bulk photovoltaic effect and is affected by the photoconductivity of the domain walls.29–31 However, engineering of ferroelectric materials to lower the bandgap without deterioration of their ferroelectric properties and to manipulate the ferroelectric domain for the above bandgap photovoltage with high photocurrent remains a challenge for high-efficiency ferroelectric photovoltaic devices.32 These factors have stimulated efforts to develop ferroelectric photovoltaic heterostructures based on oxide semiconductors, which enable efficient charge separation owing to the strong built-in internal field at the p-type oxide semiconductor/ferroelectric layer/n-type oxide semiconductor (p–f–n) junctions.33,34 However, their overall sunlight-absorption capabilities are still limited in practical photovoltaic applications.35
Thus, it is highly desirable to design a ferroelectric heterostructure that is capable of harnessing a wide range of the solar spectrum and of efficiently separating photocarriers using a combination of narrow-bandgap semiconductors, including low-dimensional nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes,36 graphene wire,37 and transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers.38 Among these materials, single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have been utilized as good building blocks for photovoltaic applications because of their strong wide-range (ultraviolet to infrared) light absorption and excellent electro–physical properties (i.e., direct bandgap, electronic sub-band structure, and high carrier mobility).39,40 However, SWCNTs can have either a semiconducting or metallic electronic structure depending on their diameter and chiral angle.41 However, despite the benefits of semiconducting (S)-SWCNTs for light absorption and charge transport in photovoltaic devices, most CNT/ferroelectric heterostructures and typical metal/ferroelectric/metal structures for ferroelectric photovoltaic devices utilize metallic (M)-SWCNTs as highly conductive and transparent electrodes and thus still exhibit low efficiency or only a slight enhancement in efficiency.42,43 Thus, it is desirable to integrate S-SWCNTs as the photoactive materials in ferroelectric heterostructures to realize high-efficiency photovoltaic devices.
Herein, we report high-performance ferroelectric photovoltaic heterostructures composed of S-SWCNTs as the p-type layer and ferroelectric BiFeO3 (BFO) thin films on n-type single-crystal Nb-doped SrTiO3 (Nb:STO) substrates. Their open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) and short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) reached up to 0.23 V and −7.52 mA cm−2, respectively, which are larger than those of single-layered BFO/Nb:STO under one-sun illumination. In particular, the device exhibited a photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 4.40%, which is comparable to that of emerging photovoltaic devices, such as dye-sensitized cells, organic cells, and quantum dot cells.44–46 This enhanced performance can be attributed to the synergetic effects of appropriate bandgaps (i.e., S-SWCNTs: 0.2–2.1 eV and BFO: 2.2–2.7 eV)1,47 for wide-range light absorption and a desirable band structure (i.e., p–f–n junctions) with electric polarization of the ferroelectric BFO layer to achieve a strong built-in electric field within the heterostructure, leading to efficient charge-carrier separation.48 In addition, the S-SWCNTs/BFO heterostructure exhibited a tunable photovoltaic effect achieved by controlling the electric polarization, which is beneficial for optoelectronic devices including optical sensors, solar cells, and photovoltaic readable non-volatile memories.
Result and discussion
Structural, optical, and ferroelectric properties of photovoltaic devices
A schematic image of the photovoltaic heterostructure consisting of S-SWCNTs, a BFO thin film, and a Nb:STO substrate is presented in Fig. 1a. The as-grown BFO thin films have atomically smooth surfaces (roughness below 0.4 nm, see Fig. S1a†). The semi-transparent Pt top electrode (10 nm) was prepared by e-beam evaporation. Details on the device fabrication are provided in the experimental section. Fig. 1b presents top-down and cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the S-SWCNTs/BFO/Nb:STO structures. A flat and sharp interface was observed between the dense and homogeneous SWCNTs layer (∼70 nm) and the BFO thin film (∼40 nm), indicating the good adhesion between the SWCNTs layer and BFO. After transferring the SWCNTs onto the BFO, vacuum heat treatment was performed at 300 °C for 30 min. The structural and optical characteristics of the devices were investigated using high-resolution X-ray diffraction (HR-XRD) and Raman spectroscopy. HR-XRD analysis revealed that the BFO thin films had highly (00l)-oriented structures with an out-of-plane lattice constant of 0.409 nm, as shown in Fig. 1c. Raman spectroscopy, a powerful method used to characterize the structural changes and electronic properties of BFO and SWCNTs, provided information on the lattice dynamics. Fig. 1d presents the Raman spectra of BFO and S-SWCNTs/BFO obtained using 532 nm excitation. Three intensive peaks appeared at 138, 171, and 219 cm−1, corresponding to the A1 modes and weak E modes at 275 and 305 cm−1 from BFO, which are similar to the frequencies of the Raman lines obtained from single-crystal BFO and BFO thin films on SrTiO3 substrates.49–51 Their assignment is based on the rhombohedral structure with space group R3c. For the S-SWCNTs/BFO, the spectra were a superposition of the signals from the S-SWCNTs and BFO. The presence of the radial breathing mode (RBM) and splitting of the G bands (Fig. S2†) are indicative of the tubular structure of the SWCNTs; in particular, their position and the shape of the modes correspond to S-SWCNTs, consistent with the light absorption spectra.

Note that the light was vertically illuminated on the surface of the devices through a mask with well-defined apertures to accurately measure the photovoltaic parameters of our devices. (b) SEM images displaying the top (right panel) and cross-section (left panel) of S-SWCNTs transferred onto a BFO thin film. (c) HR-XRD pattern of BFO thin film grown on Nb:STO (001) single-crystal substrate. (d) Raman spectra of BFO and S-SWCNTs/BFO under 532 nm excitation, showing the presence of RBM mode that is indicative of the tubular structure of the SWCNTs and three intensive A1 as well as E modes for BFO with rhombohedral-like structure. 
We also investigated the ferroelectric properties by measuring polarization–voltage (P–V) hysteresis loops using the typical positive-up, negative-down method. Fig. S1b† shows the fully saturated P–V loops for BFO and the S-SWCNTs/BFO structures. The measured remnant polarization values were almost the same at ∼55 μC cm−2. However, the coercive voltages of the S-SWCNTs/BFO were higher than those of BFO owing to the additional voltage drop on the S-SWCNTs layer. The local ferroelectric switching of the BFO thin films was also confirmed by the piezoresponse force microscopy phase image obtained after alternately applying dc 5 V and −5 V bias with two sequential writing scans. The square patterns with phase contrast clearly demonstrate that the two oppositely polarized domains are achieved by ferroelectric polarization reversal (see the right panel in Fig. S1a†).
Switchable photovoltaic effect of BFO/Nb:STO
Unlike conventional Si-based solar cells, ferroelectric photovoltaic devices can exhibit a switchable photovoltaic effect. That is, the Voc and Jsc direction can be switched by polarization reversal, which is associated with the switchable diode effect in ferroelectric heterostructures. This polarization-dependent rectification originates from modulation of the Schottky barrier at the interface between the metal and ferroelectric by polarization flipping.19,52 The Pt/BFO/Nb:STO structure exhibits a typical switchable diode effect (Fig. 2a) and the related switchable photovoltaic effect (Fig. 2b), indicating that the polarization direction determines the directions of the forward current and zero-bias photocurrent. Based on the analysis of our J–V characteristics (Fig. S3†), the effective barrier heights of the diodes in the Pdown and Pup states were estimated to be 0.65 eV (Pt/BFO) and 0.50 eV (BFO/Nb:STO), respectively. The interfacial band structure can be significantly changed by a large polarization charge. According to a simple dielectric gap model,53 the polarization charge effectively modulates the barrier height by Δφ = Pδ/ε0εr = ± 0.5 eV, with realistic parameters of polarization (P) = ± 55 μC cm−2, spatial extent of the interfacial layer (δ) = 1 nm, and dielectric constant of ferroelectric (εr) = 100. Thus, the Pt/BFO interface acts like a Schottky-like barrier in the Pdown state, whereas relatively Ohmic-like contact is formed in the Pup state, leading to a large change in the interface charge conduction with polarization reversal (ferroelectric field effect). At the BFO/Nb:STO interface, the depletion width and barrier heights are modulated by the polarization charge. The Pdown state (polarization toward Nb:STO) leads to a relatively narrow depletion region and low barrier height, whereas the Pup state (polarization away from Nb:STO) leads to an increase in the depletion width and barrier height. Thus, we expect a switchable potential barrier driven by the accumulation or depletion of screening charge at the interface in response to ferroelectric polarization reversal. We note that the asymmetric forward current and photocurrent levels may result from the difference in asymmetric modulation of the Schottky barrier height at Pt/BFO and energy band bending at BFO/Nb:STO with polarization switching. However, Guo et al.54 observed that in highly defective BFO, the switchable diode and photovoltaic effect can be driven by electromigration of oxygen vacancies under an electric field lower than the coercive field. Thus, we studied the switchable diode behavior after applying voltages both below and above the coercive voltage to obtain a qualitative estimate of the role of oxygen vacancies in the transport characteristics and the related photovoltaic response (Fig. S4†). As observed in Fig. S4,† no diode-switching behavior was observed upon the application of pulse voltages with amplitudes below and near the coercive voltages (i.e., −1.5 V and −2.0 V) for 10 ms. Interestingly, at Vp = −2.5 V (above the coercive voltages), the rectifying diode effect was suppressed, indicating that BFO has a multi-domain configuration with mixed Pup and Pdown states as a parallel connection of positive-forward and negative-forward diodes. However, further applying a pulse voltage of −3.0 V resulted in a negative-forward diode with the Pup state. Such diode switching behaviors are consistent with the polarization switching observed in the slightly slanted-hysteresis loops of BFO (Fig. S1b†). Thus, we can exclude the oxygen-vacancy-migration-induced diode switching effect often observed in highly defective BFO samples, where a gradually changing resistance would be expected with increasing pulse voltage. We also can expect the related switchable photovoltaic response to be due to polarization switching rather than oxygen-vacancy migration. As observed in Fig. 2b, one-sun illumination on the surface of BFO with the Pdown (Pup) state induced substantial negative (positive) Jsc and positive (negative) Voc. For example, the value of Jsc switched between −3.19 mA cm−2 and 1.81 mA cm−2, and Voc alternated between 0.21 V and −0.18 V. Jsc and Voc showed some variation with the polarization directions because of the asymmetric interfaces, as mentioned above.55–57

(b) Typical J–V curves of ferroelectric BFO photodiode in Pup and Pdown states, demonstrating the switchable photovoltaic effect. The inset shows the change of the short-circuit photocurrent direction with different polarization states. (c) Time-dependent photocurrent density of BFO in Pdown state under red (λ = 680 nm), green (λ = 532 nm), and blue (λ = 488 nm) lasers on and off displaying the steady-state photocurrent at zero bias. Note that the output power density of all the light sources was set to 12.5 mW cm−2. 
In addition, we compared the photovoltaic response of BFO in the Pdown state under illumination of red (R), green (G), and blue (B) lights (Fig. 2c). A noticeable difference was observed in the magnitude of Jsc for the three different light illuminations (i.e., R: 0.31 mA cm−2, G: 0.71 mA cm−2, and B: 5.83 mA cm−2), implying that the generation of photocarriers through light absorption across the bandgap of BFO (2.45 eV) contributed to the photovoltaic responses, in accordance with the UV-vis absorption spectrum (Fig. S5a†) and corresponding Tauc's plot for bandgap estimation of BFO (Fig. S6†). In addition, the change of the photocurrent density as a function of time with light on and off revealed the steady-state photocurrent at zero bias resulting from the band-to-band transition of charge carriers by absorbing photons. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the BFO/Nb:STO device are summarized in Table 1. The highest photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 3.473% was achieved under blue-light illumination with low intensity (12.5 mv cm−2); this value is comparable to that of other highly efficient ferroelectric BFO photovoltaics. For comparison, a brief summary of previously reported photovoltaic efficiencies in BFO-related materials is provided in Table S1.†

Enhanced photovoltaic performance of p-type S-SWCNTs/ferroelectric BFO/n-type Nb:STO heterostructures
Generally, the performance of photovoltaics strongly depends on the light absorption of the active materials and the strength of the built-in field in the device. The performance of ferroelectric-based photovoltaic devices in particular is mainly limited by the bandgap of the ferroelectrics and their ferroelectric properties, including the ferroelectric polarization and domain structures. Thus, to improve the properties of ferroelectric photovoltaics, the design of ferroelectric heterostructures that incorporate narrow-bandgap semiconductors and optimization of both the ferroelectric and electrode materials is necessary. In other words, the wide-range light absorption and strong built-in field achieved by modifying the energy band of a ferroelectric heterostructure can give rise to a large photocurrent at zero bias. For high-performance ferroelectric photovoltaic devices beyond single-layer ferroelectric devices (BFO/Nb:STO), we fabricated a S-SWCNTs/BFO/Nb:STO heterostructure by transferring a S-SWCNTs layer onto BFO. A schematic illustration of the separation process used to prepare the S-SWCNTs is presented in Fig. S7† (see the Experimental section for details on the eluent). These SWCNTs were classified as M-SWCNTs or S-SWCNTs by analyzing the optical properties according to the elution order.
Raman spectra of the eluent SWCNTs were fitted by Lorentzian functions with 5 peak positions (190, 218, 253, 283, and 296 cm−1), and the SWCNTs were divided into metallic and semiconducting tubes depending on their chirality (Fig. S8a†). The highly purified S-SWCNTs exhibited good light-absorption properties. The absorption peaks of the S-SWCNTs appeared over the wide range of 0.9–1.3 eV (S11), 1.3–1.9 eV (S22), and 2.7–3.5 eV (S33). (See the light absorption spectra in Fig. S8b†). The M11 peak was also observed, corresponding to M-SWCNTs. Note that the as-prepared S-SWCNTs were usually p-type in ambient air because of the absorbed oxygen on the nanotube surfaces. As a result, we expect S-SWCNTs to provide efficient light absorption as their bandgaps cover a wide wavelength range (Fig. S5a†) and charge-carrier separation owing to the desirable junction formation in the S-SWCNTs/BFO heterostructure. As can be seen in Fig. S5b,† the transparency of the S-SWCNTs film at 550 nm was 80%, while the transparency slightly decreased to ∼65% below 500 nm. Moreover, it is evident from the optical transmission spectrum that the majority of S-SWCNTs film has S22 bands. The S-SWCNTs film was observed to have a rough surface with relatively high porosity, thus we believe that the light can pass through the S-SWCNTs layer and reach the S-SWCNTs/BFO heterojunction with less interference.
We also investigated the photovoltaic behavior of the S-SWCNTs/BFO heterostructure. Fig. 3a presents current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the S-SWCNTs/BFO heterostructure in the dark and under one-sun illumination. The J–V characteristics clearly reflect diode behavior and the associated typical photovoltaic effect. It should be noted that the heterostructure exhibited higher rectification performance than the single-layer device (BFO), indicating that a stronger built-in field was developed in the heterostructure, which would improve the photovoltaic effect. At zero bias, compared with BFO (Jsc = −3.19 mA cm−2), the S-SWCNTs/BFO structure exhibited a significantly enhanced photovoltaic effect with Jsc of −7.52 mA cm−2. This result is indicative of enhancement in the photocarrier generation owing to the wide-range light absorption and efficient charge-carrier separation at the interface between the S-SWCNTs layer and BFO. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3b, substantial enhancement of the photocurrent and steady-state photocurrent were observed under illumination over the entire RGB-visible range, resulting from the synergistic effect mentioned above. Comparison of the photocurrent density obtained from BFO and S-SWCNTs/BFO illuminated with different light sources further confirmed that the S-SWCNTs/BFO structure is capable of absorbing a wide range of visible light and efficiently separating charge carriers, which is beneficial for boosting the photovoltaic performance. These findings suggest that the photocurrents are remarkably improved for S-SWCNTs/BFO through effective photocarrier generation, especially with the absorption of more R and G light rather than B light across the bandgaps of the S-SWCNTs (1.68 eV), which results in an almost doubled energy conversion efficiency of 4.40% compared with that of BFO (2.23%) under one-sun illumination (see Fig. 3c and Table 1). Note that all the devices were set to have a pre-poled BFO layer with downward polarization before photovoltaic measurement. Furthermore, we carefully investigated the thickness-dependent photovoltaic characteristics of S-SWCNTs/BFO devices compared with those of pristine BFO. Fig. S9† shows Jsc and Voc of the devices as a function of the thickness of the ferroelectric BFO under one-sun illumination. All the S-SWCNTs/BFO devices exhibited higher Jsc and Voc than the BFO devices. As expected, the photocurrent increased and the series resistance decreased with decreasing BFO thickness because the bulk resistance was lowered, as evidenced by the increase in Jsc upon decreasing the thickness from 120 to 40 nm. In addition, Voc exhibited a weak thickness dependence. However, at small thicknesses below 40 nm, the lower solar absorption and lower shunt resistance resulting from high leakage current led to a sharp decrease in both Jsc and Voc, which would lead to deterioration of the photovoltaic performance. Thus, we emphasize that optimizing the thickness of BFO to achieve a balance between solar absorption and charge conduction is critical to attaining superior photovoltaic performance. The optimum photovoltaic performance was achieved for the 40 nm-thick BFO.

(c) Comparison of photocurrent density between BFO and S-SWCNTs/BFO irradiated with different light sources. (d) Energy band alignment of S-SWCNTs/BFO/Nb:STO heterostructure, showing the efficient charge separation and reduced electron–hole recombination at the interfaces and suggesting that the use of S-SWCNTs as an effective hole-transfer layer can efficiently boost photo-generated carrier separation and transfer. 
To understand the detailed physical mechanisms resulting in the improved photovoltaic performance of the S-SWCNTs/BFO heterostructure, we considered the energy band alignment of the S-SWCNTs/BFO device, as shown in Fig. 3d. The findings suggest that the S-SWCNTs mainly work as a hole-transport layer that promotes the efficient charge-carrier separation because the p-type S-SWCNTs/ferroelectric BFO junction induces large band bending, which could serve as an energetic barrier for the back-transfer of holes to the BFO valence band. In addition, the presence of ferroelectric polarization leads to apparent changes in the electronic structure of the S-SWCNTs and the consequent modification of the surface potential at the interface, which enables efficient hole transfer from the BFO to the top electrode through S-SWCNTs.52 The S-SWCNTs layer acts as a hole-transport layer in organic/inorganic solar cells. Thus, the change in the energy band structure due to the introduction of S-SWCNTs promotes photocarrier extraction from the BFO, leading to a significant increase in Jsc and a reduction of the series resistance at the interface. To elucidate the kinetics of the charge-transfer and transport processes in our devices, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis was performed (Fig. S10†), clearly demonstrating that the S-SWCNTs/BFO structure has a lower charge-transfer resistance than BFO. In addition, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) analysis confirmed that for S-SWCNTs/BFO, the quenching of the PL curve was larger because of efficient charge transfer and more extraction from the absorber to the hole-transport layer (Fig. S11†). Therefore, the superior photovoltaic properties of S-SWCNTs/BFO mainly originate from the enhanced photon absorption over a wide range of photon energy coupled with the enhanced charge-carrier separation and transfer resulting from the strong built-in field at the S-SWCNTs/BFO junction.
Tunable photovoltaic effect of ferroelectric photovoltaic heterostructures
In addition to demonstrating the superior photovoltaic performance of S-SWCNTs/BFO, we investigated the polarization-dependent photovoltaic effect. Fig. 4a presents the J–V curves of S-SWCNTs/BFO measured under one-sun illumination using the ferroelectric poling process, controllable by adjusting the external bias voltage. Note that we were able to generate a multi-polarization state by adjusting the magnitude and width of the applied voltage pulse. When BFO had a downward polarization state by applying a 3 V pulse with ∼10 ms duration, S-SWCNTs/BFO exhibited the maximum Jsc (−7.52 mA cm−2) and Voc (0.23 V). The J–V curves were shifted toward the lower voltage direction with decreasing Jsc and Voc after a negative voltage pulse was applied, and by applying a more negative voltage pulse, Jsc and Voc were saturated at the minimum values of −0.19 mA cm−2 and 0.06 V, respectively. When a positive pulse bias was applied again, Jsc and Voc increased toward those for S-SWCNTs/BFO with a downward polarization state. In contrast to the pristine single-layer BFO structure, S-SWCNTs/BFO did not exhibit switchable diode behavior and the related photovoltaic effect but rather a tunable photovoltaic effect. That is, the photovoltaic response could be tailored by generating a partially arranged polarization reversal by applying a moderate pulse. As previously reported, the switchable diode effect in a ferroelectric capacitor and the resistance change in a ferroelectric tunnel junction are directly correlated to the ferroelectric domain configuration (i.e., the amount of upward and downward polarization in a ferroelectric layer).1,52 Thus, by adjusting the fraction of upward/downward domains within the S-SWCNTs/BFO junction, we could generate a stable and tunable photovoltaic response. To gain insight into the tunable photovoltaic effect in S-SWCNTs/BFO, we compared the energy band diagrams of the S-SWCNTs/BFO/Nb:STO heterostructure in downward and upward polarization states, as shown in Fig. 4b. As reported in our previous work, the ferroelectric polarization in p–f–n junctions affects the charge transport because of the different electrostatic potential profiles at the interfaces depending on the ferroelectric polarization direction.17 In the downward polarization state, our heterostructure exhibited higher Jsc owing to the band alignment and polarization-induced electric field coupled with the same direction across the p–f–n junctions. In addition, the potential barrier for the downward polarization state was lower than that for the upward polarization state. In contrast, in the upward polarization state, severe electron–hole recombination and a large resistance at the interface are expected owing to the higher potential barrier and wider depletion region, leading to lower Jsc and Voc.58,59 Therefore, the modified band alignment induced by ferroelectric polarization can enhance charge-carrier separation within junctions and suppress electron–hole recombination at the interfaces.

Note that the polarization of BFO can be fully or partially switched by applying short voltage pulses of 10 ms and varying amplitude, and then, the J–V curve was measured using sweep voltages in the range of ±1 V below the coercive voltages. The inset presents a profile of the voltage pulse for stabilizing intermediate polarization states. (b) Schematic illustration of energy band alignments for S-SWCNTs/BFO/Nb:STO heterostructure in downward (top) and upward (bottom) polarization states, respectively. A downward polarization state is clearly beneficial for photogenerated charge-carrier extraction and separation by energy band bending. 
Experimental section
Ferroelectric thin-film fabrication
The (001)-oriented Nb:STO substrates were chemically and thermally treated to obtain atomically flat TiO2-terminated surfaces. Wet acidic surface treatment was performed. During rinsing of the substrate in water, SrO or TiO2 of the SrTiO3 surface reacted with the water to form hydroxide complexes. The hydroxide complexes on the surface were removed using the buffered oxide etchant (BOE) NH4F:HF = 7:1 for 50 s. The chemically treated substrates were annealed for 10 h at 900 °C to obtain atomically flat surfaces with step and terrace morphology (Fig. S12†).
The BFO thin films were prepared on Nb:STO substrates using pulsed laser deposition. 10% Bi excess BFO target was ablated by an excimer laser (KrF, λ = 248 nm) at 525 °C and 100 mTorr oxygen partial pressure. The laser power was 1.5 J cm−2, and the repetition frequency was 10 Hz. After the deposition, the BFO thin films were cooled to room temperature under an oxygen partial pressure of 500 Torr. A semi-transparent Pt electrode with 10 nm thickness and 200 μm diameter was deposited on the surface of the BFO thin film using e-beam evaporation.
SWCNTs separation and film fabrication
SWCNTs from a high-pressure carbon monoxide process (HiPco, <35%, diameter: 0.8–1.2 nm, Unidym, Inc.) were dispersed in 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, ≥98.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) aqueous solution at 1 mg ml−1 and sonicated using horn-type sonication (130 W) for 4 h. The solution was centrifuged to remove bundled tubes and impurities (111000 g-force for 4 h at room temperature), and the well-dispersed SWCNTs solution was collected. Agarose gel (Sepharose 2B, bead size of 60–200 μm, GE Healthcare) was packed in a 30 mm-diameter column. The column was washed with distilled water and then equilibrated with 1% SDS aqueous solution. Then, the SWCNTs solution was added to the column. Using 1% SDS solution, a reddish solution was collected as the first eluent, with a green component remaining in the column. After elution of the reddish solution, the column was washed with distilled water. Then, the greenish solution was collected as a second eluent using 1% sodium deoxycholate (DOC, ≥98.0% Sigma-Aldrich). The absorbance and RBM of the first (reddish) eluent and second (greenish) eluent were characterized using ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared spectrophotometry (Agilent, Cary 5000) and Raman spectrometry (Renishaw, 633 nm, HeNe laser).
The SWCNTs eluent was filtered through an anodic aluminum oxide filter (AAO, 47 mm, 0.1 μm, Whatman). The SWCNTs film was floated on 3 M NaOH solution while the AAO was dissolved and was then transferred onto BiFeO3/Nb-doped SrTiO3. Vacuum heat treatment was performed at 300 °C for 30 min to completely bond the interface between BFO and SWCNTs. The SWCNTs were prepared with fixed optical transmittance of ∼80% at 550 nm (Fig. S5b†).
Characterization of thin films and photovoltaic devices
The structural properties and morphologies of the SWCNTs and BiFeO3 thin films were analyzed using high-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 DISCOVER) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, TESCAN MIRA-II), respectively. The Raman spectra (WiTec alpha 300R, 532 nm laser) were collected at room temperature in backscattering geometry in the range of 100 to 650 cm−1.
The ferroelectric properties of the BFO thin film were characterized by measuring the polarization–voltage hysteresis curve using the positive-up, negative-down (PUND) method. The PUND method is suitable for separating ferroelectric polarization charges and all non-ferroelectric contributions such as leakage current. Piezoresponse force microscopy (SEIKO 300 HV) was used to verify local switching of the ferroelectric polarization.
The photovoltaic responses were characterized using a source-measure unit (Keithley 4200) under simulated AM 1.5G (Abet Technologies' solar simulator) and red (25 mW, λ = 680 nm), green (25 mW, λ = 532 nm), and blue (25 mW, λ = 488 nm) laser sources. The irradiation area was carefully calibrated using a shadow mask.60 Note that all the J–V measurements were performed by sweeping the voltages far below the coercive voltages for polarization switching.
The steady-state (SS) and time-resolved (TR) photoluminescence (PL) were measured using a fluorescence lifetime spectrometer (Quantaurus-Tau C11367-12, HAMAMATSU) with the excitation provided by a 372 nm laser (PLP-10, HAMAMATSU) pulsed at a frequency of 10MHz for SSPL and 200kHz for TRPL. The TRPL of each device (with or without SWCNTs) was determined using a time-correlated single-photon counting technique to measure the spontaneous PL decay with each emission wavelength at 490 nm (without S-SWCNTs) and at 570 nm (with S-SWCNTs).
Conclusions
We demonstrated the significantly enhanced photovoltaic performance in a p-type S-SWCNTs/ferroelectric BFO/n-type Nb:STO photovoltaic heterostructure resulting from the effective charge-carrier separation and wide-range light absorbing capability. The modified band alignment by ferroelectric polarization and the introduction of S-SWCNTs as a hole-transport layer resulted in efficient charge transfer at the interface and effective carrier extraction from the absorber, leading to the enhanced photocurrent and superior photovoltaic performance (corresponding photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 5.0% under blue-light illumination). Moreover, stepwise adjustable photovoltage and photocurrent was possible by applying an external bias voltage pulse (the so-called tunable photovoltaic effect). We expect that the combination of photo-ferroelectrics with small-bandgap materials will contribute to the realization of multifunctional and high-efficiency photovoltaic devices.
