It is found that the absorption spectra of BIDC3 and BIDC4 are broader than that of BIDC1 and BIDC2 because the former two have one more benzene ring on the electron acceptor side. Upon adsorption on a TiO2 electrode, the absorption spectra of the four BIDC dyes are all broadened forward to both red and blue sides compared with their respective spectra in ethanol solution. BIDC2 (or BIDC4), bearing two carboxyl groups, has about two (or three) times more adsorption and a broader absorption spectrum on TiO2 film compared with BIDC1 (or BIDC3), which consequently leads to a better light-to-electricity conversion property. Among the four hemicyanine dyes, BIDC4 generated the highest photoelectric conversion yield of 4.9%, with a short-circuit photocurrent of 21.4 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 424 mV, and a fill factor of 0.49 under irradiation with 90.0 mW cm−2 white light from a Xe lamp.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells have been potential competitors against conventional photovoltaic cells since the report of highly efficient ruthenium complex-sensitized TiO2 solar cells by Grätzel and co-workers.1,2 To date, the best performance has been obtained with ruthenium polypyridyl derivatives.3–5 However, pure organic dyes are also attractive sensitizers6–21 because they have the following advantages16 over metal complexes. In comparison with metal complexes, pure organic dyes generally have higher absorption coefficients, which could reduce the amount of dye to be used and reduce the thickness of the semiconductor film. More importantly, pure organic dyes are easier to prepare and cost less. In fact, organic dye sensitized TiO2 solar cells have made great progress in recent years, and the highest overall yield of solar cells sensitized by pure organic dyes has exceeded 5%,15,21 indicating that organic dyes would be a promising type of sensitizer for dye sensitized solar cells.
On the basis of our previous studies on photoelectric conversion of hemicyanine dyes in LB films,22–28 we introduced -RSO3− as attaching groups into hemicyanine dyes and systematically studied the steric hindrance effect on the adsorption and photoelectric conversion properties of the dye.20 In a very recent report, we found that through treating TiO2 films with hydrochloric acid, the photocurrent of hemicyanine dye (containing -RSO3− groups) sensitized TiO2 solar cells was greatly enhanced with conversion yields up to 5.1%.21 Such a high value encouraged us to further study hemicyanine dyes containing -COOH groups as sensitizers for Grätzel type solar cells.
In this paper, we investigated the photoelectrochemical properties of a series of hemicyanine dyes (Scheme 1) having different numbers of attaching groups (-COOH) and different electron donors. Upon comparison some interesting results were obtained.

Optical transparent conducting glass (CTO glass, fluorine-doped SnO2 overlayer, transmission >70% in the visible region, sheet resistance 20 Ω square−1) was obtained from the Institute of Nonferrous Metals of China. N-Methyl-4-methylpyridinium iodide (PyI) was synthesized according to the literature.22 2-[4-(N-Ethyl-N-carboxyethyl)amino]phenylethenyl-1,3,3-trimethyl-3H-indolium iodide (BIDC1), 2-[4-(N,N-dicarboxyethyl)amino]phenylethenyl-1,3,3-trimethyl-3H-indolium iodide (BIDC2), 2-[4-(N-ethyl-N-carboxyethyl)amino]phenylethenyl-1,1,3-trimethyl-1H-benz[e]indolium iodide (BIDC3) and 2-[4-(N,N-dicarboxyethyl)amino]phenylethenyl-1,1,3-trimethyl-1H-benz[e]indolium iodide (BIDC4) were synthesized according to the literature,29,30 and the syntheses route is briefly illustrated in Scheme 2.

Preparation of nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes
The nanocrystalline TiO2 films with different thickness were prepared according to the procedure described in the literature.20,31 As the film thickness can strongly affect the action spectrum and the overall energy conversion efficiency, the effect of film thickness on the performance parameters of the dye sensitized solar cell was also investigated, and 5 µm thick film was found to be optimal. The TiO2 film electrodes thus obtained were coated with dye in a 3 × 10−4 mol dm−3 ethanol solution for 12 h at room temperature. The amount of adsorbed dye was determined by spectroscopic measurement of the concentration change of the dye solution before and after adsorption.
Methods
Film thickness was determined with a DEKTAK 3 profilometer. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker ARX400 and ARX500 spectrometers. Elemental analyses were performed on a Carlo Erba 1106 elemental analyzer. The UV-Vis spectra were measured with a Shimadzu mode 3100UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer. The fluorescence spectra were observed on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Synchrotron radiation photon–electron spectroscopy (SRPES) was measured on a photon–electron spectrometer (vsw Scientific Instruments, Ltd.). Under an ultrahigh vacuum of (3–4)
× 10−8 Pa, photon–electron spectra were recorded under 18.7 eV synchrotron radiation light, from which the first ionization energy, the HOMO energy level, was derived for different hemicyanine dyes.
The photoelectrochemical experiments were carried out in a standard two-electrode system.2,32 One drop of redox electrolyte solution was put onto the dye loaded TiO2 film (effective area is 0.188 cm2) and a Pt sputtered ITO glass was used as counter electrode. The redox electrolyte solution was composed of 0.5 mol dm−3 LiI, 0.05 mol dm−3 I2, and 0.6 mol dm−3 PyI in PC. A 500 W xenon lamp (Ushio Electric, Tokyo, Japan) served as a white light source in conjunction with an IRA-25S filter (Schott, USA) and a GG400 cutoff filter (Toshiba, Japan). Here, an IRA-25S filter was used to cut off infrared light to protect the electrode from heating, and a GG400 cutoff filter was used to filter off light with wavelength less than 400 nm, which prevents excitation of the TiO2 films. Monochromatic light in the region of 400 nm to 800 nm was produced by setting an IRA-25S filter and a suitable band-pass filter (Schott, USA) in the path of the light beam. Light intensities were measured with a Light Gauge radiometer/photometer (Coherent, Auburn, CA).
Result and discussion
A. Absorption properties in solutions and on TiO2 film

Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra of BIDCs in ethanol solution. BIDCs have characteristic π–π* electron transition bands around 570 nm in ethanol solution because of similar conjugation systems. However, the different acceptors (e.g., 1,3,3-trimethyl-1H-indolium group or 1,1,3-trimethyl-1H-benz[e]indolium group) and the different numbers of attaching groups (e.g., one or two -COOH group(s)) result in different absorption properties. Compared with BIDC1 and BIDC2, BIDC3 and BIDC4 have one more benzene ring on the electron acceptor side, which enhanced the extent of electron delocalization over the whole molecule, so their absorption peak and the threshold of the longer wavelength side were red shifted a little. As shown in Table 1, the absorption peaks for BIDC1, BIDC2, BIDC3 and BIDC4 are 561 nm, 560 nm, 577 nm and 578 nm, respectively. The spectra of BIDC3 and BIDC4 in ethanol solution are similarly broad and are broader than those of BIDC1 and BIDC2, indicating that one more carboxylic group has little influence on the absorption properties in relatively diluted ethanol solution (3 × 10−6 M). Here, we understood that BIDC dyes were present as the monomeric form in such diluted solution. The maximum absorption coefficients (εmax) for BIDCs are also illustrated in Table 1, and are much higher than those of Ru complexes (1.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1).2 It is reported that the dyes have the tendency to aggregate in solution or at the solid–liquid interface owing to strong intermolecular van der Waals-like attractive forces between the molecules.33 For BIDCs this kind of aggregate can occur readily because of the presence of carboxyl groups in the molecules. The absorption spectra of the dyes in ethanol solutions with different concentrations are shown systematically in Fig. 2. The data show that the absorption peaks of the hemicyanine dyes were all blue shifted with increasing concentration of the solution, suggesting that BIDC dyes have the tendency to form H aggregates when the solution concentrations increase. At the same concentration, BIDC2 or BIDC4 have larger blue shifts than BIDC1 or BIDC3 because of their extra carboxyl group.

Fig. 3 gives the absorption spectra of the four dyes on TiO2 films after 12 hours adsorption. Upon adsorption on TiO2 film the spectra of BIDCs are broadened compared with those in ethanol solution (c.f.Fig. 1), and the interesting thing is that the spectra of the dyes with two carboxyl groups (BIDC2 or BIDC4) are broader than their congeners (BIDC1 or BIDC3) which bear one –COOH. As an example, the spectra of BIDC4 on TiO2 film with different adsorption times are given in Fig. 4. The phenomenon is observed that the spectra were broadened on both sides, that is, both blue shifted and red shifted. The same phenomena were also observed with the other three dye congeners.

 Fig. 4  Absorption spectra of BIDC4 on TiO2 with different adsorption times: (a) 5 min, (b) 15 min, (c) 30 min, (d) 60 min, (e) 105 min and (f) 585 min. The absorption of the CTO glass and TiO2 film was corrected. 
The amount of BIDCs dye adsorbed on a TiO2 electrode per unit area was measured and the results are listed in Table 1. BIDC1 and BIDC3 have almost the same adsorption amount (0.53 × 10−7 mol cm−2 and 0.52 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively), while BIDC2 and BIDC4 have larger values of 2.10 × 10−7 mol cm−2 and 1.50 × 10−7 mol cm−2 , respectively, which are almost four and three times those of BIDC1 and BIDC3. So the spectra of BIDC2 and BIDC4 are broader than those of BIDC1 and BIDC3, indicating that they could convert solar light to electricity in a larger region.
B. HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the dyes
To judge the possibility of electron transfer from the excited dye to the conduction band of TiO2, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of −5.8 eV for BIDC1, −5.8 eV for BIDC2, −5.7 eV for BIDC3 and −5.7 eV for BIDC4 were measured by synchrotron radiation photon–electron spectroscopy (SRPES) under vacuum. With reference to the absorption maxima of 561 nm (1.9 eV), 560 nm (1.9 eV), 577 nm (2.0 eV) and 578 nm (2.0 eV), corresponding to the gap between the HOMO and LUMO levels for BIDC1, BIDC2, BIDC3 and BIDC4, respectively, the energy levels of the LUMO can be estimated to be −3.9 eV, −3.9 eV, −3.7 eV and −3.7 eV respectively. Obviously, the excited-state energy levels for the four dyes are higher than the bottom of the conduction band of TiO2
(−4.4 eV), clarifying that electron injection should be possible thermodynamically.
C. Fluorescence emission properties of the dyes
All four dyes display a strong fluorescence emission at room temperature. Interestingly, the fluorescence emission bands of the dyes in the visible region disappear when the dyes are adsorbed onto the nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes. The phenomena can be explained by the efficient electron injection from the excited singlet state of the dyes to the conduction band of TiO2, and suggesting that all four dyes are good sensitizers for nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes.
D. Photoelectrochemical properties of the TiO2 electrode sensitized by BIDCs
Photocurrent action spectra for the dye-coated TiO2 electrodes are shown in Fig. 5. The monochromatic incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE), defined as the number of electrons generated by light in the outer circuit divided by the number of incident photons, was obtained by means of the following equation: (1)where the constant 1240 is derived from unit conversion, Isc is the short-circuit photocurrent generated by monochromatic light, and λ is the wavelength of incident monochromatic light, the light intensity of which is Pin. The losses of light reflection and absorption by the conducting glass were not corrected. From Fig. 5 one can see that all four dyes can efficiently convert visible light to photocurrent in the region from 400 nm to 660 nm. Comparing the dye's IPCE spectra with absorption spectra on TiO2 film (c.f.Fig. 3), all the four dyes have sensitization selectivity for different regions of visible light, that is, they convert more efficiently light of shorter wavelength. It can be observed from Fig. 4 that in accordance with the absorption spectra on TiO2 film, the action spectra for BIDC2 and BIDC4 are broader than those of BIDC1 and BIDC3, and BIDC4 has higher IPCE values (>60%) in the region from 460 nm to 640 nm, indicating that a BIDC4 sensitized TiO2 electrode would generate a higher conversion yield.
 Fig. 5  Photocurrent action spectra of the TiO2 electrodes sensitized by BIDCs. The reflection and absorption of the CTO glass were not corrected. 
The photoelectrochemical properties of BIDCs sensitized TiO2 electrodes are listed in Table 2, while the photocurrent–voltage curves are shown in Fig. 6. The dye-coated TiO2 film, as working electrode, was placed on top of an ITO glass as a counter electrode, on which the 200 nm thick Pt was sputtered. The redox electrolyte was introduced into the interelectrode space by capillary force. The solar cells were illuminated from the front through the conducting glass substrate. Fill factor (FF) is defined as: FF =
VoptIopt/VocIsc(2)where Vopt and Iopt are voltage and current for maximum power output, and Voc and Isc are open-circuit photovoltage and short-circuit photocurrent, respectively. The overall yield (η) is expressed by the following equation: η
=
(VocIscFF)/Pin(3)where Pin is the power of incident white light. We can see from Fig. 6 and Table 2 that the short-circuit photocurrent of the BIDC4-sensitized TiO2 electrode is much higher than those of BIDC1-, BIDC2- and BIDC3- sensitized systems, respectively. BIDC1 has the lowest short-circuit photocurrent and overall yield because of its much lower IPCE values and converts light to electricity in a relatively narrower light region. BIDC4 exhibits the highest short-circuit photocurrent and overall yield due to its higher IPCE values in a broad light region.

E. Relationship between photoelectrochemical properties and chemical structures
From the adsorption amounts in Table 1 and the short-circuit photocurrents in Table 2, the contribution of one mole of dye molecules to the short-circuit photocurrent could be calculated and the values are also listed in Table 2. Comparing BIDC1 (or BIDC2) with BIDC3 (or BIDC4), one can find that they have the same donor but different acceptor. The benzeneindolium group has one more benzene ring than the indolium group; this fact makes BIDC3 (or BIDC4) have a broader absorption spectrum than BIDC1 (or BIDC2) in ethanol solution because of the larger electron delocalization, and consequently leads to better photoelectric conversion properties to some extent. For example, one mole of BIDC1 produced 2.32 × 108 mA short-circuit photocurrent, while the short-circuit photocurrent generated by one mole of BIDC3 is 2.79 × 108 mA. For BIDC2 and BIDC4, the values are 7.57 × 107 mA and 1.43 × 108 mA, respectively. On the other hand, it is easy to find that BIDC1 (or BIDC3) and BIDC2 (or BIDC4) have the same acceptor but different donor. One more carboxyl group is attached onto the amino group in the latter, which drastically increased the adsorption of the dye on the TiO2 electrode, and the spectrum of the latter greatly expanded to both red and blue sides, and this is beneficial to photoelectric conversion efficiency. For example, the adsorption amount for BIDC3 is 5.2 × 10−8 mol cm−2, while that for BIDC4 is 1.5 × 10−7 mol cm−2. That is, the adsorption amount for the latter is about three times larger than that of the former. Alternatively, if we focus on the short-circuit photocurrent of the solar cell sensitized with the dyes, it is easy to find that the three times larger amount of BIDC4 molecules did not generate a three times larger short-circuit photocurrent, and the increment is only 48%. This result can be explained by the contribution of one mole of molecules to the short-circuit photocurrent. One mole of BIDC3 generate 2.79 × 108 mA short-circuit photocurrent while for BIDC4 the value is just 1.43 × 108 mA, which is only a half of that of the former. Obviously, the carboxyl group appears to have two different effects on the adsorption and photoelectric conversion properties of the dye. The positive effect is that the adsorbed amount of dye molecules on the TiO2 film greatly increased, which is favorable for the overall light to electricity conversion. However, at the same time, the second carboxyl group impeded the charge separation of the molecules because it was attached onto the electron donor side and hence reduced the polarity of the molecules to some extent. Stronger adsorption of the dye on the TiO2 film could on the other hand facilitate charge recombination of the injected electron and the dye cation, and attaching of the adsorbing groups to the electron donor side could to some extent impede the electron transfer from the redox-active electrolyte to the dye cation. The same rule can be found in the comparison between BIDC1 and BIDC2.
Conclusion
In this paper, we designed and synthesized four novel hemicyanine congeners, and investigated systematically the relationship between the photoelectrochemical properties and structures. Through investigation of their absorption and photoelectrochemical properties, among the four hemicyanine dyes, BIDC4 is found to be the best sensitizer, which has a conversion yield of 4.9%, with a short-circuit photocurrent of 21.4 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage of 424 mV and a fill factor of 0.49 under illumination with 90.0 mW cm−2 white light from a Xe lamp. Our study indicates that through reasonable design, hemicyanine dyes could perform excellent spectral sensitization. Furthermore, more efficient hemicyanine dyes as sensitizers could be designed after studying the structure–efficiency relationship.
