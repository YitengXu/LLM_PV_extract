    , Accepted 13th February 2017First published on 14th February 2017AbstractAlkyl chain engineering has been employed to tune the physicochemical properties of conjugated polymers. Usually, several building blocks with different alkyl chains need to be synthesized in multiple steps, which is synthetically costly. Also, it is challenging to systematically tune the alkyl chains to enhance device performances due to the complex morphological characteristics of the conjugated polymers and the effects of molecular weight and purity. Here we designed and synthesized a series of conjugated polymers with similar molecular weights through random polymerization of BDT building blocks with two TT building blocks possessing different alkyl chains. Upon simply altering the molecular ratio of two TT units, the physicochemical characteristics, solid state packing, and photovoltaic properties of the conjugated polymers were systematically tuned. As a result, a conjugated polymer that can pair with both fullerene (PC71BM) and non-fullerene (ITIC-Th) acceptors to generate high power conversion efficiencies (10.3% and 9.1%, respectively) was achieved. This contribution provides a novel strategy for designing high performance conjugated polymers.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells have attracted great attention due to their advantages of flexibility, low-cost fabrication, and high throughput energy generation. To date, numerous conjugated donor materials have been designed and synthesized to tune their physicochemical properties, solid state packing and donor/acceptor blend film morphology.1,2 As a result, a few conjugated polymers with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10% have been reported.3–5 Solution processable conjugated polymers are generally composed of two parts: π-conjugated backbones and peripheral side chains. Most efforts have been focused on conjugated backbones that generally determine the optoelectronic properties of the conjugated polymers.6,7 In contrast, the side chains have not been fully exploited, even though various types of side chain substituents, such as alkyl chains,8–13 hybrid side chains,14–17 ionic side chains,18,19 oligoether side chains,20 fluoroalkyl side chains,21,22 and latently reactive side chains,23,24 have been tested over the past few decades.25
Alkyl side chain engineering has been used to tune the physicochemical properties and solid state packing of conjugated polymers due to the advantages of easy accessibility and excellent solubilizing characteristics of alkyl side chains.25 There are two forms of alkyl chains: linear and branched alkyl chains. It has been observed that linear alkyl chains can promote self-assembly of the conjugated polymers through interchain interdigitation, facilitating charge transport and raising the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the polymers.25 As a result, introducing linear alkyl chains into conjugated backbones may enhance the short current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF), but decrease the open circuit voltage (VOC) of the conjugated polymers and PCBM-based OPVs. In comparison, branched alkyl chains generally preclude interchain interdigitation since their bulkiness may hinder interchain interactions, which jeopardizes charge transport and decreases the HOMO energy levels. Not surprisingly, replacing linear alkyl chains with branched ones in the conjugated backbone may increase VOC, but decrease JSC and FF for the conjugated polymer-based OPVs. Obviously, linear and branched alkyl chains have contradictory influence on the physicochemical properties, solid state packing, and photovoltaic performances of conjugated polymers. Several groups have engineered the linear and branched alkyl chains to optimize the optoelectronic properties and enhance photovoltaic performances of conjugated polymers. You and co-workers reported six polymers of PNDT-DTBT based on naphtha[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (NDT) and 4,7-di(thiophene-2-yl)benzothiadiazole (DTBT) with different alkyl chains. Through tuning the bulkiness of the side chains, the authors suggested that the VOC increases, but JSC decreases with the increase of the bulkiness of the side chains. As a result, the highest PCE of 3.36% was achieved for PNDT-DTBT with intermediate side chain bulkiness.26 Marks, Chen, and Yu studied the influence of side chain bulkiness on the photovoltaic performance of PBDT-TT polymers based on thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) and benzodithiophene (BDT) and found that there is a positive correlation between the strength of π–π interactions through the polymer backbone stacking in the film and the OPV device fill factor.27 In all the above studies, several building blocks with the same backbone but different alkyl chains need to be synthesized in multiple steps to construct a series of conjugated polymers, which is generally synthetically costly. Furthermore, it is challenging to systematically tune the alkyl chains to enhance photovoltaic performances due to the complex morphological behaviors of the conjugated polymers and the effects of molecular weight and purity.
Conjugated polymers PBDT-TT are excellent donor materials for high performance organic photovoltaics due to their optimal energy levels, strong light extinction coefficients, and unique solid state packing characteristics, generating PCEs over 9% through molecular engineering.28,29 Upon further device engineering, efficiency over 10% has been achieved.3,30–32 The influence of regio- and chemoselectivity on the properties of PBDT-TT polymers has been studied, which showed that the composition of the backbone is critical to achieve superior optoelectronic materials.33 In this contribution, a series of conjugated polymers PBDT-TT (P1–P5) with similar molecular weights were designed and synthesized through random polymerization of BDT building blocks with one equivalent of two TT building blocks possessing different alkyl chains, ethylhexyl and propyl. Through simply varying the molecular ratio of two TT units, the physicochemical characteristics, solid state packing, and photovoltaic characteristics of the conjugated polymers were systematically tuned. Along with the increase of the content of propyl chains in the polymers, the open circuit voltage (VOC) of the polymer-based solar cells decreased, while the short circuit density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) first increased and then decreased. As a result, P3 based solar cells afforded an average PCE of 10.1%, which is among the few conjugated polymers with over 10% efficiency.3–5,34
2. Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of polymers
The PBDT-TT polymers P1–P5 were synthesized through the random copolymerization of 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT(EH), 1) with one equivalent of a mixture of dibromo-2-​ethylhexyl-3-fluorothieno-​[3,​4-b]​-​thiophene-​2-carboxylate (TT(EH), 2) and dibromo-2-propyl-3-fluorothieno-​[3,​4-b]​-​thiophene-2-carboxylate (TT(P), 3) (molecular ratio of TT(EH):TT(P), 10:0 (P1); 7:3 (P2); 5:5 (P3); 3:7 (P4); 0:10 (P5)) through Stille coupling with yields of 60–80% (Scheme 1). The success of random polymerization was supported by 1H NMR and elemental analysis (see the Experimental section). All polymers display excellent solubility in chloroform and chlorobenzene. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) results showed that the five polymers possess comparable molecular weights (Mn, 69–76 kDa) and polydispersity indexes (PDI ≈ 1.9–2.2), which minimize the effect of molecular weight on the photovoltaic performances. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) demonstrated that all polymers possess an onset decomposition temperature (Td) over 370 °C under nitrogen flow, indicative of excellent thermal stability (Fig. S6†). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that all polymers are amorphous without detectable endotherms and exotherms (Fig. S7†).

In order to precisely investigate the influence of introducing linear alkyl chains on the optical properties, each optical absorption spectrum was measured five times by UV-vis spectroscopy as shown in Fig. 1. In solution, P1–P5 showed similar absorption spectra with two distinct bands at 300–400 nm and 500–800 nm, similar to the reported PBDT-TT polymers,35 which can be assigned to the π–π* transition and an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) band, respectively. In the absorption spectra of thin films, the absorption peaks showed an obvious bathochromic shift in comparison to those in solution due to intense solid state packing. Note that the absorption peak red shifted from 705 ± 2 to 713 ± 1 nm, and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the absorption band at 500–800 nm also increased from 160 ± 1 to 169 ± 1 nm along with the increase of the ratio of TT(P) in the conjugated polymers, suggesting that introducing linear alkyl chains promotes strong interchain π–π stacking and broad light absorption, which may be beneficial for charge transport and light absorption. The optical bandgaps (Eg) were estimated from the low energy band edges in the film absorption spectra. The Eg of P1–P5 is 1.61, 1.60, 1.59, 1.59, and 1.58 eV, respectively, showing that an increase of the ratio of propyl chains in the side chains can shrink the bandgaps due to enhanced π–π interactions.

Cyclic voltammograms of the polymers as thin films are shown in Fig. 1 and summarized in Table 1. Based on the onset of the oxidation potential of the polymers from the CV, the HOMO energy levels were estimated as HOMO = −(Eonsetox + 4.44) eV. With this method, the HOMO energy levels of P1–P5 are determined to be −5.33, −5.29, −5.26, −5.24, and −5.20 eV, respectively. Obviously, adding more TT building blocks with linear alkyl chains raised the HOMO energy levels due to the stronger interchain interaction, since it is well known that the interchain interaction can raise the HOMO energy levels.36 By adding the Eg from the HOMO, the LUMO energy levels of P1–P5 are −3.72, −3.69, −3.67, −3.65, and −3.61 eV, respectively.

Photovoltaic performance
Bulk heterojunction solar cells with a structure of ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag were fabricated to investigate the photovoltaic performances of P1–P5. 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) was used as an additive for the polymer:PC71BM solution to achieve an optimum bicontinuous morphology.37 The typical J–V curves are shown in Fig. 2a and the photovoltaic characteristics are summarized in Table 2. The results showed that the P1:PC71BM based solar cells afforded an average efficiency of 9.17% with JSC = 17.85 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.795 V, and FF = 65%, which is comparable to the reported efficiency.29 As shown in Fig. 2c, the VOC decreased from 0.795 to 0.755 V with the increase of the molecular ratio of TT(P) in the conjugated polymers (P1 → P5), ascribed to the increase of their HOMO energy levels. Furthermore, JSC increased from 17.85 to 19.41 mA cm−2 when the donor conjugated polymers were changed from P1 to P4, which may be attributed to the broader light absorption and the enhanced interchain π–π stacking from P1 to P4. However, the JSC slightly decreased to 18.49 mA cm−2 for P5 based solar cells, which may be ascribed to the change of the morphology of the blend films. Also, the FF subsequently increased from 65% (P1) to 69% (P3), and then slightly decreased to 62% (P5). As a result, the average efficiencies for P2–P5 based solar cells are 9.48%, 10.05%, 9.67%, and 9.07%, respectively. The highest PCE for P3 based solar cells reached 10.3%, which is among the few conjugated polymers that can afford over 10% efficiency with a regular inverted device structure.4,5

The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the solar cells were also investigated to further understand the photovoltaic characteristics. In general, the EQE curves are consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectra as shown in Fig. 1c, which covers the spectrum from 300 to 800 nm. The integrated JSC values from the EQE spectrum for P1–P5 based devices were 19.46, 19.7, 20.42, 20.07, and 18.76 mA cm−2, respectively. The calculated ones are within 8% of the measured JSC values, indicating that the J–V measurements are reliable. The errors may be because the size of the incident light during the EQE measurements is much smaller than the size of one solar cell.

P3 was also used to fabricate non-fullerene solar cells with ITIC-Th38 with a device structure of ITO/ZnO/PEIE/P3:ITIC-Th/MoO3/Ag. The typical J–V curve is presented in Fig. S9† and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1.† The results showed that the average efficiency is 8.91% with a maximum of 9.10%, which is higher than the reported efficiency of P1:ITIC-Th (8.4%),38 indicating P3 is a better light absorber. Furthermore, the EQE curve of the solar cell simulated the UV-vis absorption spectra as shown in Fig. S1.† The integrated JSC value is 17.51 mA cm−2, slightly smaller than the measured value (18.11 mA cm−2).
Solid state packing and morphologies of thin films
In order to understand the influence of alkyl chains on the photovoltaic performances of conjugated polymers, the solid state packing of the P1–P5 pristine films and blend films with PC71BM was investigated with GIXD. Fig. S10a–e† present the 2D GIXD patterns of pristine films, and Fig. 3a and b show the corresponding out-of-plane and in-plane cuts to quantify the scattering data, respectively. It is observed that a broad arc-like scattering (q = 1.60 Å−1) arises from the Bragg diffraction of P1 in the out-of-plane direction, corresponding to the π–π stacking peak with a d-spacing of 3.92 Å. Also, a much weaker arc-like Bragg diffraction was observed at q = 0.27 Å−1, ascribed to an edge-on orientation with a lamellar d-spacing of ∼23.1 Å. Furthermore, a strong (100) peak corresponding to the lamellar packing appeared at q = 0.27 Å−1 in the in-plane direction, while no (200) and (300) peaks were observed since the mixing of branched side chains attached to the TT units along with branched side chains on the BDT units makes lamellar packing in the in-plane direction quite difficult. Also, the π–π stacking peak (q = 1.60 Å−1) was not observed in the in-plane direction. These observations indicate that P1 molecules adopt a dominant face-on orientation with respect to the substrate, similar to the reported results.30 Remarkably, two obvious trends were observed in the pristine films when the content of propyl chains in the side chains increased (P1 → P5) as shown in Table S2.† First, the d-spacing distances of both π–π stacking and lamellar packing continuously shrink, resulting in 3.81 and 21.8 Å for P5, respectively. This observation demonstrated that the interchain interactions enhanced when the branched alkyl chains (ethylhexyl) were replaced with linear alkyl chains (propyl). Second, the intensity of the face-on π–π stacking peak (010) subsequently became stronger in the 2D images from P1 to P5, thus suggesting an increased ratio of face-on oriented molecules.
 Fig. 3  Out-of-plane (a and c) and in-plane (b and d) line cuts of the GIWAXS images of pristine films (a and b) and polymer:PC71BM blend films (c and d). 
Fig. S11a–e† show the 2D GIXD patterns of the blend films and the corresponding out-of-plane and in-plane cuts. The Bragg diffraction peaks of PC71BM and the polymers were extracted by fitting the out-of-plane cuts with the Gaussian equation (Fig. 3c and d).30 Compared with the pristine films, the intensity of the lamellar stacking peak (100) of the blend films became more remarkable in the out-of-plane direction, while the intensity of the face-on stacking peak of the blend films became weaker by the addition of PC71BM, indicating that the addition of PC71BM may promote the edge-on orientation of the polymers. Interestingly, the blend films also demonstrated similar trends to the pristine films along with the increase of the content of the linear chains of side chains (P1 → P5) (Table S2†). In the out-of-plane cuts of P1 blend films, the broad peaks corresponding to π–π stacking and lamellar packing are located at 1.61 (d = 3.90 Å) and 0.30 Å−1 (d = 21.1 Å), respectively. When the content of linear alkyl chains was increased, the d-spacing distances of both π–π stacking and lamellar packing decreased, suggesting stronger interchain interactions. As a result, the two arc-like peaks for interchain and lamellar packing of P5 are located at 1.64 (d = 3.84 Å) and 0.31 Å−1, (d = 20.3 Å) respectively, which are shorter than those of P1. Furthermore, from P1 to P5 blend films, the Bragg diffraction peak (010) increased in the 2D images and became sharper in the out-of-plane direction. This observation indicates that more conjugated molecules adopt the face-on orientation along with the increase of the linear alkyl chains, which may be beneficial for the bulk charge transport capabilities.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) were used to investigate the influence of the morphology by changing the content of alkyl chains. Fig. 4a–e show the AFM topographic images of the P1–P5:PC71BM blend films. It is believed that the smoothness of the morphology can influence the contact between the blend films and electrode and thus the charge collection efficiency.39 In general, the polymers:PC71BM blend films demonstrated a smooth morphology, supporting their high short current density. Furthermore, the P1:PC71BM blend films exhibit a morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.83 nm, larger than those of the other four polymer blend films. This is consistent with the lowest JSC of P1:PC71BM blend film based solar cells. R-SoXS studies can provide an important route to probe the spatial dimensions of phase separation domains with statistical significance (Fig. 4f and Table S3†).40–42 The R-SoXS profile of the P1:PC71BM blend film showed a diffuse scattering at 0.013 Å−1, which is in accordance with ∼47 nm length scale phase separation (domain size equals the half of this value, 23.5 nm). Furthermore, the profiles of the other four polymer blend films demonstrated scattering peaks in the range from 0.015 to 0.018 Å−1, corresponding to the domain sizes between 21.0 and 17.6 nm. Obviously, the P1–P5 based blend films demonstrated optimum domains (∼20 nm), benefiting exciton separation and charge transport, which is in accordance with the high JSC and FF of the polymer based solar cells.35,43

Charge generation, dissociation, and transport properties
One of the important steps to determine the photovoltaic performance is the exciton dissociation, which can be probed by photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy.44 As shown in Fig. S13,† PL emission bands of P1–P5 were found in the range of 750–850 nm with maximum peaks at 765, 768, 769, 772, and 775 nm, respectively. The quenching efficiency of the blend films of P1–P5:PC71BM is 83.3%, 89.9%, 88.9%, 89.9%, and 87.0%, respectively. This result is consistent with the JSC of the corresponding polymer based solar cells, where P2–P4 based solar cells possess higher JSC than those based on P1 and P5.
To further gain more insight into the charge generation and dissociation process of the polymer solar cells, the saturation current density Jsat and charge dissociation probabilities P(E,T) of P1–P5 based devices were investigated. Fig. 5c shows photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves. Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the photocurrent densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is determined as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage where Jph equals zero and Va is the applied bias voltage.45 It is assumed that all the photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by electrodes at high Veff (2 V in this case) and the saturation current density Jsat is only limited by the absorbed incident photons. The Jsat values for the five devices were 19.1 mA cm−2 (P1), 19.6 mA cm−2 (P2), 19.7 mA cm−2 (P3), 20.5 mA cm−2 (P4), and 19.5 mA cm−2 (P5), respectively. The largest Jsat value of the P4 based device suggested the most efficient overall exciton generation, consistent with the highest short current density (19.41 mA cm−2).46 This means that the light absorption change of the polymers through tuning the alkyl chains is an important contribution for the change of the current density. P(E,T) is determined by normalizing Jph with Jsat (Jph/Jsat).47 The P(E,T) values under short current density conditions for P1–P5 based devices are 94.4%, 95.2%, 96.4%, 94.9%, and 94.7%, respectively. Obviously, the P2–P4 based devices exhibit a more efficient exciton dissociation process than those based on P1 and P5, which is consistent with the studies of photoluminescence.

The bulk charge transport mobilities are critical for fill factors of solar cells, which are influenced by the solid state packing, including the interchain distances and molecular orientation.48 The space charge limited current (SCLC) method was used to investigate the bulk charge transport mobilities and probe the relationship between solid state packing and device performance. The hole mobilities were measured with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag, while the electron mobilities were characterized with the device structure of ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The J1/2vs. V curves are shown in Fig. 5 and the calculated hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of the blend films are summarized in Table S4.† Not surprisingly, the electron mobilities are in the range of 1.42–1.83 cm2 V−1 s−1. Interestingly, the hole mobilities of the blend films are increased through the incorporation of propyl chains (P1 → P5), which is attributed to a high degree of ordering and the face-on π–π stacking distance as demonstrated in GIXD. In addition, the hole mobility has an inverse relationship with π–π stacking distances.27 The GIXD results have demonstrated that π–π stacking distances shrank from P1 to P5, thus leading to high SCLC mobilities as demonstrated in previous work.8,49 Thus, the high FF values of the polymer systems are reasonably ascribed to the balanced mobility, face-on molecular orientation, and short π–π stacking. Furthermore, it is believed that the FF factor is correlated with the high and balanced mobilities.50,51 The ratios of μh to μe for P1–P5 blend films are 0.46, 0.89, 1.04, 1.22, and 1.88, respectively. This is in good agreement with the trend of the FF of P1–P5 based solar cells, which is 0.65, 0.66, 0.69, 0.67, and 0.62, respectively.

In addition to light absorption and charge dissociation, JSC and VOC as a function of light intensity for P1–P5 based devices were also measured to probe the recombination kinetics. Generally, JSC demonstrates a power-law dependence on light intensity (JSC ∝ PlightS).52,53 When JSC adopts a linear function with Plight, it would suggest weak bimolecular recombination. As shown in Fig. 5d, the exponential factors of P1–P5 based devices are 0.973, 0.971, 0.976, 0.997, and 0.965, respectively. These values are generally close to 1, indicating that the bimolecular recombination is weak in all five devices, in accordance with their excellent photovoltaic performances. Furthermore, the largest S number for P4 based devices suggested that bimolecular recombination was weakest, supporting the highest JSC in P4:PC71BM solar cells.

Fig. 5e shows the curve of VOCversus Plight in P1–P5 devices. The slope of VOCversus ln(Plight) is useful to determine the degree of trap-assisted recombination in the devices. The slope equals n × kBT/q, where kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature and q is the elementary charge. When n is one, it means that bimolecular recombination is the dominant mechanism. The dominant mechanism is trap-assisted or Shockley–Read–Hall recombination when n is equal to two.54,55 For the P1–P5 based solar cells, the n values are 2.79, 2.55, 2.60, 3.11, and 2.88, respectively. This result indicates that the trap-assisted recombination is the dominant mechanism in these systems, similar to the reported results.
3. Conclusions
In summary, a series of conjugated polymers P1–P5 with different contents of branched and linear alkyl chains were synthesized through random polymerization. This synthetic methodology provides an efficient method to study the influence of side chains on other conjugated polymers. Based on the opto- and electrochemical, solid state packing, and charge transport studies, we revealed that the energy levels, the interchain distances and orientation, and hole mobilities of the conjugated polymers can be systematically tuned through alkyl chain engineering. Thus, the photovoltaic characteristics of the conjugated polymers were tuned to achieve high performance solar cells with over 10% efficiency, which were probed with morphology, charge generation, dissociation, transport, and recombination studies. This contribution is meaningful to elucidate the structure–property relationships of high performance materials and afford new insights into the rational design of superior conjugated materials for organic solar cells.
4. Experimental section
Materials
PC71BM was purchased from American Dye Source. Unless otherwise stated, all of the chemicals were purchased from Energy Chemical and used as received. All reactions were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere. Ethylhexyl 4,6-dibromo-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate (compound 2),54 propyl 4,6-dibromo-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate (compound 3),54 and 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (compound 1)29 were synthesized according to the procedures reported in the literature.
Synthesis method of random polymers
In a Schlenk tube (25 mL), compound 1 (181 mg, 0.2 mmol) and the mixed compounds 2 and 3 (total 0.2 mmol) were dissolved in the mixed solvent (toluene (5 mL) and DMF (1 mL)). The mixture was bubbled for 30 min with nitrogen at room temperature. Pd(PPh3)4 (12 mg, 0.01 mmol) was added under a nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was stirred at 120 °C for 36 hours. The polymerization proceeded for an additional 12 hours after adding 2-trimethyltin-thiophene (15 μL) and 2-bromothiophene (45 μL) as end-capping agents. After the resulting solution was cooled down to room temperature, it was poured into methanol (250 mL). The resulting precipitate was collected by filtration, and the product was then further purified by Soxhlet extraction successively with acetone, hexane and THF for 2 days. The polymer was redissolved in THF and then precipitated with methanol. Finally, the solid was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum overnight. The reaction conditions and purification processes were similar for all five random polymers. The yield, elemental analysis and GPC results of the polymers are given below.

Characterization
The 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 400 MHz NMR spectrometer using TMS as an internal standard with CDCl3 as solvent at room temperature. Elemental analysis was performed on a FLASH EA 1112 Elemental Analyzer. TGA measurements were performed on a Shimadzu thermogravimetric analyzer (model DTG-60) under a continuous nitrogen flow at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. DSC measurements were performed on a TA Instruments differential scanning calorimeter (Q2000) under nitrogen at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were done on a CHI600E electrochemical workstation in an electrolyte solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in dry acetonitrile at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. A three-electrode cell was used in this analysis. A Pt wire, glassy carbon disks, and Ag/AgCl were used as the counter, working, and reference electrodes, respectively. Ferrocene/ferrocenium was used as an internal standard by running CV at the end, and the potential was calibrated to 0.5 eV, which was assumed to have an absolute energy level of −4.44 eV to vacuum (HOMO = −Eox − 4.44 eV, LUMO = HOMO + Eg). The films of the copolymer were coated onto the glassy carbon disks by adding polymer solutions dropwise into chloroform. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Gary 60 UV-vis spectrophotometer at room temperature. Fluorescence emission spectra were excited at 705 nm and recorded using a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies). The film samples of UV-vis and PL were spin cast on quartz substrates using identical blend solutions to those used in devices. The morphology of the blend films was observed by using a Scanning Probe Microscope-Dimension 3100 in tapping mode. All film samples of AFM were spin cast on ZnO/Si substrates. GIXD characterization was performed at beamline 7.3.3 Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and the samples were prepared on Si substrates. R-SoXS was performed at beamline 11.0.1.2 Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and the samples were prepared on Si/PEDOT:PSS substrates.
Fabrication of solar cells
Solar cells with the inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag were fabricated. The patterned ITO glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonic agitation in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and iso-propanol (each 15 min), and subsequently dried overnight in an oven before use. The substrates were treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber for 30 min. The ZnO precursor solution was prepared using a sol–gel procedure by dissolving zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(O2CCH3)2·(H2O)2, 99.9%, 100 mg, Aldrich) and ethanolamine (HOCH2CH2NH2, 99.5%, 28 μL, J&K Scientific) in anhydrous 2-methoxy ethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, >99.8%, 1 mL, J&K Scientific) under vigorous stirring for more than 24 h for the hydrolysis reaction and aging. ZnO thin films with a thickness of ca. 20 nm were prepared by spin-coating the sol–gel precursor solution at 4000 rpm for 40 s on top of the ITO substrate. The films were annealed at 200 °C for 30 min in air. Then all subsequent procedures were performed in a glovebox under a N2 atmosphere. The polymer:PC71BM (D/A ratio 2:3 w/w) active blend layer, with a nominal thickness of ∼80–100 nm, was prepared by spin-coating a mixed solvent of chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodoctane (97%:3% by volume) solution (with a total concentration of 25 mg mL−1) at 2000 rpm for 80 s. The resulting photoactive layer was dried in a glovebox for 4 h before electrode deposition. Non-fullerene solar cells were fabricated with a solution (total of 20 mg mL−1) of P3:ITIC-Th (D/A ratio 1:1.3 w/w) with 3% 1-chloronaphthalene in chlorobenzene, spin-coated (2200 r.p.m. for 60 s) on the ZnO layer to form a photosensitive layer. A 10 nm MoO3 layer and a 100 nm Ag layer were subsequently evaporated by thermal evaporation under 10−5 Pa. The active layers of the five polymers with PC71BM were prepared under the same conditions. All J–V characteristics were measured under AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2) using a Newport solar simulator with a Keithley 2400 semiconductor analyzer. EQE measurements were performed using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enli Technology Co. Ltd., Taiwan).
SCLC mobility measurements
Space charge-limited currents were measured in electron-only devices with a configuration of ITO/ZnO/active layer/Ca/Al and hole-only devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The devices were prepared following the same procedure described in the fabrication of inverted solar cells for photovoltaic devices, except for the metal electrode. The mobilities were determined by fitting the dark current to the model of a single carrier SCLC current with field dependent mobility, which is described as J = 9ε0εrμV2/8L3, where ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, μ is the hole mobility, V = Vappl − Vbi, Vappl is the applied voltage, Vbi is the built-in voltage (for hole-only diodes, Vbi was 0.2 V; for electron-only diodes, Vbi was 0 V), and L is the thickness of the film.
