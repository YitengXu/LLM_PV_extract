    , Accepted 29th October 2010First published on 3rd December 2010AbstractA new series of organic sensitizers LJB-H, LJB-Fo and LJB-Fm with triphenylamine, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene plus various functionalized phenylenes, and cyanoacrylic acid as the donor, π-spacer, and anchoring group, respectively. These organic sensitizers exhibit much higher molar extinction coefficients than the parent LJ1 dye as well as reveal a remarkable fluorine substituent effect. LJB-Fm with fluoro substitution at the meta position relative to cyanoacrylic acid possesses a lower S0–S1 gap and weaker coupling with the TiO2 electrode (cf.LJB-H and LJB-Fo). Conversely, due to the resonance effect with respect to cyanoacrylic acid, the ortho-F-substituted LJB-Fo has a larger energy gap but stronger TiO2 affinity. As a result, LJB-Fo shows better DSSC performance with Jsc = 15.58 mA cm−2, Voc = 787 mV, FF = 0.67 and η = 8.22%.
Introduction
Exhaustion of fossil fuel reserves and increased global warming are recognized as the most critical problems encountered in this century. In this regard, research targeted at solar energy harvesting is currently under extensive investigation. One useful technology should be ascribed to the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), which is expected to dominate the low-cost niche market of consumer photovoltaics in the future.1 Typical DSSCs consist of a dyed semiconductor TiO2 photoelectrode, a Pt counter electrode and redox electrolyte.1c For the technical aspects, it has been recognized that the nature of sensitizers, no matter whether they are ruthenium based2 or pure organic,3 their redox potential, structure and photophysical properties, etc., play pivotal roles in determining the overall cell efficiencies. As such, there is continuous interest in exploring better sensitizers, electrolytes and device structure.4 Due to the relatively high cost of ruthenium element, numerous research groups have expended endeavors to develop metal free organic dyes as the alternative sensitizers. As a result, impressive photovoltaic performances have been reported on various tailor-made organic dyes, which include coumarin,5 indoline,6 oligoene,7 merocyanine,8 hemicyanine,9 perylene,10 spirobifluorene,11 and even chlorophyll derivatives,12 showing promising η values in the range of 5–9.8%. Recently, we reported a simple organic DSSC dye LJ1 (see Scheme 1).13 The core design of LJ1 lies in the introduction of triphenylamine14 (TPA) as donor and these two moieties are bridged by an electron-rich 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene15 (EDOT) unit. Accordingly, the LJ1-sensitized solar cells prepared with a 12 + 4 μm thickness of TiO2 film reached global AM 1.5 power conversion efficiencies up to 7.3%. Subsequently, Wang et al.15a reported using EDOT plus thienothiophene as π-conjugated spacer connected to TPA, exhibiting an almost panchromatic response to solar irradiation. Very recently, we proposed that an ortho-fluorine substituent (with respect to the cyanoacrylic acid anchor) might play a pivotal role to enhance DSSC performance.16 Herein, we report on a comprehensive study in optimization of the LJ1 relevant dyes through increasing the optical absorption cross section and expanding light absorption capability to improve the photocurrent density. To achieve this goal, a facile approach was introduced by successfully incorporating a phenylene unit and fluorine-substituted phenylene into the LJ1 framework (see Scheme 1), coded LJB-H, LJB-Fo and LJB-Fm. We also aim to probe in-depth the fluorine substitution effect for LJB-FoversusLJB-Fm as well as their comparison to LJB-H, that lacks a fluorine substituent, on the DSSC performance. As a result, this new series of organic sensitizers exhibit much higher molar extinction coefficients than the parent LJ1 and show DSSC performance that reveals a significant fluorine substituent effect.

Experimental section
General procedures
All reactions were performed under nitrogen atmosphere and solvents were distilled from appropriate drying agents prior to use. All reactions were monitored using pre-coated TLC plates (0.20 mm with fluorescent indicator UV254). Mass spectra were obtained on a JEOL SX-102A instrument operating in electron impact (EI) or fast atom bombardment (FAB) mode. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury-400 or an INOVA-500 instrument. Elemental analysis was carried out with a Heraeus CHN-O Rapid Elementary Analyzer. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Jasco V-570 UV/Vis/NIR.

Fabrication of DSSC and photovoltaic measurements
The Pt counter electrode was prepared by spin-coating a 50mM H2PtCl6 in isopropyl alcohol on FTO glass, followed by sintering at 385 °C for 15–30 min. Transparent TiO2 paste was prepared using published procedures.17 The transparent TiO2 thin film with a thickness of 9 μm was first deposited on a transparent conducting oxide (F-doped SnO2, FTO). This film was dried at 150 °C for 15 min and then a 4 μm thick layer of 400 nm TiO2 particles (Ti-Nanoxide 300 paste from Solaronix) was deposited again by the doctor-blade method to form a square with dimensions of 0.4 × 0.4 cm2. Afterwards, the double-layered films were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. After sintering, the TiO2 films were treated with 40 mM of TiCl4 solution, rinsed with water and ethanol, and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 electrode was immersed into a solution containing 0.3 mM of LJB dyes, 1 mM of deoxycholic acid (DCA) in mixed CH3CN and tert-butanol solution (volume ratio: 1:1) overnight. After being rinsed with EtOH, the dye-coated TiO2 electrode was incorporated into a sandwich cell structure with a Pt-coated FTO as counter electrode, and a film (Surlyn 1702, 25 μm) as a spacer between the electrodes. The electrolyte solution was then injected into the cell through a drilled hole in the back of the counter electrode. Lastly, the hole was sealed using a hot-melt ionomer film and a cover glass. Incident light-to-electricity conversion efficiency values were measured using a modified light source, 450 W Xe lamp (Oriel, 6266), an Oriel 81088 Air Mass 1.5 Global Filter and a digital source meter purchased from Keithley Instruments Inc. The incident light intensity was calibrated using a standard solar cell composed of a crystalline silicon solar cell and an IR cutoff filter (Schott, KG-5), giving the photoresponse range of an amorphous silicon solar cell.
All solid-state DSSCs experimental section
The solid-state DSSCs are prepared using a modification of a literature report.18 Briefly, an 80 nm-thick compact layer of TiO2 was deposited on the F-doped SnO2 (FTO, Tech 8 grade) by spray pyrolysis at 450 °C. After that, TiO2 (∼20 nm in size) paste was spin coated on the compact-layered TiO2 and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min, forming the mesoporous TiO2 film, the thickness of which varied from 1.0 μm to 3.0 μm in an aim to maximize the device performance. Subsequently, the sensitizers were applied to the as-prepared TiO2 film by a dipping method in 0.3 mM dye solution for 10 h, followed by spin coating with hole-transporting materials (a mixture composed of spiro-OMeTAD, tert-butylpyridine, and Li(CF3SO2)2N in chlorobenzene). Finally, the counter electrodes, Ag, were thermally evaporated onto the top of the spiro-OMeTAD blend. Note that no antireflective coating was applied in this application.
Measurement of impedance spectra and electron lifetimes
The AC impedances of the cells were carried out under dark (−0.68 V) and illumination (open-circuit voltage conditions) by using a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 12, AUTOLAB). The recombination lifetimes of photoinjected electrons with oxidized dyes were measured by the stepped light-induced transient measurements of photocurrent and voltages (SLIM-PCV).19 A diode laser (λ = 635nm) was used as a continuous light source and modulated by using a function generator. The initial laser intensity was a constant 90 mW cm−2 and was attenuated up to approximately 10 mW cm−2 using a ND filter. The beam size was slightly larger than 0.4 × 0.4 cm2 to cover the area of the device. The laser was operated at a voltage of 3.0 V and stepped down to 2.9 V for 5 s.
Results and discussion
The syntheses leading to the isolation of LJB series of organic dyes involve the multi-steps protocols which are depicted in Scheme 2. The first step is the coupling of 4-bromo- or 4-chloro-benzaldehyde with either 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) substituted dioxaborolane or tributylstannane reagent using Suzuki or Stille cross coupling, respectively. We have also tested the reaction of EDOT substituted dioxaborolane with 4-chloro-3-fluorobenzaldehyde, but the product yield was not as good as the reaction employing dioxaborolane. The remainder of the preparation follows the known chemistry protocol of organic push–pull dyes. The resulting aldehydes (1a, 1 and 1b) was then reacted with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) to afford the bromide substituted EDOT derivatives (2a, 2 and 2b), which then reacted with triphenylamine substituted dioxaborolane under Suzuki coupling to yield the amine functionalized aldehydes (3a, 3 and 3b). The condensation between 3a, 3 and 3b with cyanoacrylic acid in the presence of ammonium acetate afforded the final organic dyes LJB-Fo, LJB-H, and LJB-Fm, respectively.

Fig. 1 shows the absorption spectra of these LJB series dyes recorded in DMF. The corresponding film absorption on 6 μm thickness TiO2 is also depicted in the inset of Fig. 1. Their pertinent photophysical and electrochemical properties are summarized in Table 1. Both LJB-Fo and LJB-H dyes show an intense absorption band around 420 nm, which is assigned to intramolecular charge transfer between the TPA donor and cyanoacrylic acid. Its molar extinction coefficient, being about 42000 M−1cm−1 (420 nm), is much higher than that of LJ1 (ε = 26100 M−1 cm−1).13 In comparison with LJB-Fo and LJB-H, the absorption of LJB-Fm exhibits a red-shift peaks at 439 nm (ε = 33800 M−1 cm−1) in DMF. The appreciable red shift is due to the meta-fluorine inductive effect with respect to the cyanoacrylic acid moiety, so that the fluorine electron withdrawing property lowers the LUMO energy (vide infra), resulting in the smallest energy gap among all LJB series.

Fig. 2 shows the frontier orbital configurations of LJB dyes calculated from density functional theory (DFT). The results reveal that HOMOs of all LJB dyes have similar electron density distributions, which are mainly populated over the TPA moiety, while the LUMOs are delocalized through the cyanoacrylic acid and its adjacent phenyl group. Clearly, the lowest transition was dominated by charge transfer from the TPA to the cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group. Nevertheless, subtle differences can be distinguished. The LUMO of LJB-Fm shows a greater contribution localized in the cyanoacrylic acid part (cf.LJB-Fo and LJB-H), giving the strongest D–A strength and hence the smallest HOMO–LUMO gap. This viewpoint is also supportive by the smallest calculated S0–S1 gap for LJB-Fm (see Table S1 of the supporting information†) among the LJB series. The calculated S0–S1 gap for LJB-Fo is slightly smaller than that of LJB-H (see Table S1). This seems opposite to the experimental result (see Fig. 1) and may be tentatively rationalized by the resonance (or mesomeric) effect between ortho-fluorine and cyanoacrylic acid in LJB-Fo, the result of which reduces the electron accepting strength of cyanoacrylic acid with respect to the donor site, i.e. the TPA moiety, causing less solvent-polarization stabilization than that of LJB-H.

Relative to LJ1, the new LJB series dyes achieved the original proposal of gaining a higher extinction coefficient by incorporating extended π-conjugation into the frameworks of the parent structure. These advantages allow us to reduce the thickness of the TiO2 layer, which may result in great suppression of dark current and hence increase of photovoltage.6a,20
Prior to the fabrication of DSSCs, cyclic voltammetry was performed to ensure that their LUMOs are suited for injecting electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 and whether their HOMO matches the energy level of the redox electrolyte. In a practical manner, Eox of the dyes adsorbed on a 6 μm thick TiO2 nanoporous thin film on FTO glass was measured (see Table 1). The results reveal that the redox potential of I−/I3− (ca. 0.4 V vs. NHE)21 is more negative than the HOMO and is able to regenerate the dye from electron donation. Their LUMO levels are also sufficiently more negative than the conduction band edge of the TiO2 electrode (ca. −0.5 V vs. NHE at pH 7).21 Especially for LBJ-Fm, the electron withdrawing fluorine substituent is located at the meta-position with respect to the cyanoacrylic acid group, leading to much stabilization of the π* orbital and hence a smaller π–π* energy gap, consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectrum measurement.

Fig. 3 shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of LJB dyes obtained with a sandwich cell using 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in dry acetonitrile (CH3CN). The corresponding IPCE spectra exhibit a high plateau of 85% and the performance of >80% was observed from 410 to 570 nm. For both LJB-Fo and LJB-Fm, the onset of the IPCE data is close to ∼740 nm, while that for LJB-H is ∼720 nm. Note that the IPCE is roughly flat in the range 400–600 nm, which seems to be different from the absorption profile (see inset of Fig. 1). In this study, the 6 μm thick transparent TiO2 film was used for film absorption spectra measurement, whereas for the measurement of solution-based IPCE spectra, the films were composed of 9 μm thick transparent TiO2 film and 4 μm thick layer of 400 nm TiO2 particles. The effect exerted by the latter scattering layer is more obvious.
 Fig. 3  The photocurrent action spectra of DSSCs sensitized with various LJB dyes. 
Moreover, a solid-state dye-sensitized solar cell (SSDSSC)17,22 was also fabricated using LJB-Fo sensitizer and hole conductor 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD). The maximum IPCE value of this SSDSSC was 49% at 435 nm, which is somewhat smaller than liquid DSSC performance because of using much thinner TiO2 film (1.6 μm), resulting in a lower light-harvesting capability.

Fig. 4 shows the photocurrent–voltage curves of the devices employing LJB dyes under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight at 100 mW cm−2, while pertinent performance data are summarized in Table 2. For a fair comparison, these DSSC devices were made with parameters relevant to that of the LJ1 reference cell reported in the literature.13 When an optimized TiO2 thickness of 9 + 4 μm was applied to LJB-Fo dye, the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and overall conversion efficiency (η) are 15.58 mA cm−2, 787 mV, 0.67 and 8.22%, respectively. Its conversion efficiency is higher than that of the reported LJ1 cell (η = 7.3%, thickness: 12 + 4 μm).13 Moreover, under all solid-state conditions, the LJB-Fo dye gives Jsc = 7.75 mA cm−2, Voc = 950 mV, and FF = 0.62, corresponding to an overall η = 4.53%. An impressive benefit of the SSDSSC is the higher value of Voc attained (950 mV), which is much higher than that of the liquid-electrolyte based DSSCs, a result of the more positive redox potential of spiro-OMeTAD versus that of the I−/I3− redox couple used in the liquid-based DSSCs.22a

Furthermore, a much thinner TiO2 film was used for solid-state DSSCs, which consequently reduces the unwanted back electron transfer from the TiO2 conduction band to the charge carriers.22a Finally, for studying the fluorine substituent effect, the LJB-Fm sensitized liquid-based DSSC was also fabricated, giving Jsc = 15.78 mA cm−2, Voc = 735 mV, and FF = 0.60, corresponding to an overall η = 7.00%. This LJB-Fm sensitized solar cell shows slightly higher current density, which coincided with the red-shifted absorption spectrum versus that of LJB-Fo, as revealed by the respective IPCE spectra (see Fig. 3). Furthermore, compared with LJB-Fo, the non-fluorine substituted LJB-H gives slightly lower current density (14.73 mA cm−2), which may be due to their weak electronic coupling with nanoporous TiO2 and hence the decrease of dye uptake. As listed in Table 2, the amounts of dyes absorbed on TiO2 film are 3.88, 3.73, and 3.81 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for LJB-Fo, LJB-H and LJB-Fm, respectively. The largest uptake for LJB-Fo may be rationalized by the resonance conjugation between fluorine and carbonyl groups, increasing the ligand basicity and hence the TiO2 affinity. Further evidence is provided by the IPCE response. According to absorption spectra in solution, LJB-H reveals a longer wavelength absorption onset (∼570 nm) than that (∼530 nm) of LJB-Fo, while the IPCE data of LJB-Fo are endowed with better sensitization in the red region, revealing improved electronic coupling of LJB-Fo on the TiO2 surface.
The fluorine substituted dependence of Voc in this class of LJB dyes is of great interest. The ortho-fluorine substituted LJB-Fo gives the greatest Voc value among the LJB series. To further shed light on the difference in Voc among the LJB series dyes, the AC electrochemical impedance spectra23 of the liquid-based DSSCs were measured in the dark under forward bias (−0.68V). As shown in Fig. 5, the radius of the semicircle in the intermediate frequency regime of the Nyquist plot is in the order of LJB-Fo > LJB-H > LJB-Fm, indicating that the recombination rate is increased in the order of LJB-Fo < LJB-H < LJB-Fm in the dark.24 This AC impedance data coincides with the trends of dark current and Voc values. In order to gain more insight into the electron transport of LJB series dyes, the AC electrochemical impedance of the cells was also measured under illumination (100 mW cm−2). As shown in Fig. 6, the radius of the semicircle in the intermediate frequency regime, according to the Nyquist plot, is in the order of LJB-Fm > LJB-H > LJB-Fo. These results indicate that the charge transport is in the order of LJB-Fo > LJB-H > LJB-Fm, which coincides with the overall device performances.24b

 Fig. 6  Impedance spectra measured under the illumination (open-circuit voltage conditions) with various LJB dyes. 
For further support of the above viewpoint, we then measured electron lifetimes in the photoelectrode to gain direct information on the electron transport properties. Fig. 7 shows the lifetimes (τe) of the DSSCs employing different dyes as a function of the Jsc. The τe values were determined by the photovoltage transients induced by a stepwise change in the laser light intensity controlled with a function generator.19 The result indicates that τe values are affected by the types of dye molecules prepared. The measured electron lifetime is in the order of LJB-Fo > LJB-H > LJB-Fm. The result implies the order of Voc to be LJB-Fo > LJB-H > LJB-Fm, consistent with those of Voc resolved experimentally (see Table 2).
 Fig. 7  Electron lifetimes in the as-prepared DSSCs with various LJB dyes. 
For rationalization of the fluorine substitution effect, on the one hand, due to the higher TiO2 surface coverage, the electron recombination occurring in the proximity to photoanodes is reduced (cf.LJB-H), resulting in the reduction of dark current and hence an increase of Voc.25 However, LJB-Fm shows a slightly higher dye uptake than that of LJB-H, but gives a lower Voc value instead, casting doubt on this interpretation. Alternatively, the result may point to the dipole-induced changes of the conduction band energy level, Ecb, of TiO2 with respect to the redox potential of the electrolyte (Eredox). It has been reported that the electronic properties such as band bending, electron affinity, and work function, of semiconducting materials could be fine-tuned by adsorption of organic molecules with different dipole moments.26 Recently, this phenomenon has been successfully introduced to interpret electrochemical behavior in a DSSC system.27 More quantitatively, the Car–Parrinello method has been applied to describe the characteristic appearance of the intrinsic dipole moment of dyes adsorbed onto TiO2 surfaces such as (TiO2)38 clusters by means of geometry optimization.28 Unfortunately, the computation methodology is currently unavailable in our laboratories. As for a qualitative approach, due to the resonance effect between ortho-fluorine and cyanoacrylic acid, the dipole moment (negative site) of the anchored LJB-Fo seems to point toward the TiO2 surface and hence shifts Ecb in a direction that increases the energy difference between Ecb and Eredox. On the other hand, the inductive effect via the meta-fluorine substitution in LJB-Fm may lead to a dipole moment pointing away (cf.LJB-Fo) from the TiO2 surface, and hence stabilizes Ecb upon anchoring onto the TiO2 surface.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we reported herein a new series of organic dyes, namely LJB-Fo, LJB-H and LJB-Fm, that contain TPA and cyanoacrylic acid as electron donor and acceptor, respectively, together with one phenylene (or fluorophenylene) unit as the spacer. Relative to the parent LJ1 dye, the LJB series of dyes achieve the goal of gaining greater absorptivity via incorporating an extra phenylene into the π-framework. This, together with the extension of the absorption onset toward the longer wavelength region, leads to the enhancement of light-harvesting capabilities that allows us to reduce the thickness of the TiO2 layer as well as to suppress dark current and hence increase Voc. Upon optimization, LJB-Fo has attained 8.22% efficiency reproducibly along with an acetonitrile based volatile electrolyte. Based on the solid-state DSSC architecture, the LJB-Fo sensitizer gives Jsc = 7.75 mA cm−2, Voc = 950 mV, and FF = 0.62, corresponding to an overall η = 4.53%. The results also manifest the importance of fluorine substitution on overall device performances, which can be classified into inductive versus resonance effects that influence the D–A strength as well as electronic coupling with nanostructured TiO2 to different extents. Future extension to multiple fluoro substitution is feasible due to its ubiquitous applications in OLEDs and artificial amino acid syntheses. We thus believe that fluorine chemistry may pave a new avenue en route to photovoltaic applications.
