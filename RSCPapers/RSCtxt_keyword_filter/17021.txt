    , Accepted 1st March 2022First published on 2nd March 2022AbstractCuprous oxide (Cu2O) has been widely investigated in optoelectronic devices because of its non-toxicity, high optical absorption coefficient, intrinsic p-type conductivity, and high hole mobility. However, misaligned energy levels remain an obstacle to obtaining efficient optoelectronic devices due to the extremely high conduction band minimum of Cu2O. Here, a band-aligned wide bandgap Ga2O3 buffer layer is introduced and a graded heterojunction ZnO/Ga2O3/Cu2O is realized. The oxygen-vacancy concentration and therefore the Fermi level, optical transmittance, and bandgap of the Ga2O3 films can be tuned by controlling the oxygen environment during pulsed laser deposition. The performance of the optoelectronic devices is improved by incorporating an optimized Ga2O3 buffer layer deposited at 1 Pa oxygen pressure with a deposition temperature of 100 °C. Photodetectors with a response range from the near-ultraviolet to the visible-light region, good linearity, fast response, and excellent long-term stability are demonstrated. In the meantime, an enhancement of the external quantum efficiency of 66% was reached by inserting the Ga2O3 buffer layer. Heterojunctions with gradient energy bands are confirmed to be effective in accelerating charge transport and suppressing carrier recombination through Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) studies. Our work provides a new approach for developing self-powered ultraviolet and visible-light photodetectors with low-cost and high stability.
Introduction
High-performance film photodetectors are in great demand for applications such as environmental detection, space detection, and charge-coupled device cameras, which has led to the significant development of materials suitable for photodetectors.1–4 Cuprous oxide (Cu2O) is an earth-abundant non-toxic p-type semiconductor with a direct bandgap of approximately 2 eV, which is suitable for the sustainable development of energy conversion and visible-light photodetectors.5–9 Varieties of n-type metal oxide semiconductors including ZnO,10,11 TiO2,12 and SnO213 have been widely used in the field of photo-detection. However, the conduction-band offset between Cu2O and those n-type electron-selective layers due to the high conduction band (−3.2 eV) of Cu2O inhibits the realization of efficient optoelectronic devices.14–16 The energy-level structure of thin-film optoelectronic devices determines the internal kinetics of carrier generation, separation, transport, recombination, and collection, which are important determinants for high-performing devices.17,18 Gallium oxide (Ga2O3), a wide-bandgap semiconductor of approximately 5.0 eV, has been demonstrated to reduce interfacial recombination by improving the band alignment across the aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO)/Cu2O heterojunction and reducing the interface defect density.7,19,20 In Cu2O-based solar cells, a Ga2O3 layer up to 90 nm does not obstruct the photo-current, which suggests that the electronic band of the Ga2O3 layer is favorably aligned with the neighboring layers of Cu2O and AZO.19,21 Although Ga2O3 shows n-type conductivity from theoretical and experimental studies of this material, undoped Ga2O3 often behaves like an insulator due to its large bandgap, where the resistance from the Ga2O3 layer could be a major contribution to the series resistance of the device, ultimately leading to a low fill factor (FF).22,23 For photovoltaic-type devices, such as solar cells or self-powered photodetectors, it is very important to separate the electron–hole pairs and extract carriers separately through interfacial or buffer layer depositions. The n-type buffer layer with a suitable band structure, optical transmission, and suitable electrical conductivity is very promising for its multiple functions of the optical transparency, the extraction of electrons, and blocking the back flow of holes to suppress carrier recombination. Therefore, it is important to modulate the n-type conductivity and its bandgap of Ga2O3 by adjusting its Fermi level. A stepped band-structure arrangement may minimize the energy loss and enhance the carrier extraction.
Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) is a technique suitable for stoichiometric growth, which enables the introduction of oxygen vacancies to be varied by adjusting the incoming oxygen pressure, thereby modulating the Fermi level, bandgap, and conductivity of the oxide semiconductor.24,25 Therefore, to make wide-bandgap Ga2O3 as a buffer layer material for optoelectronic devices, it is quite important to modulate the oxygen vacancies so that the energy levels are better matched. However, conventional ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) is usually subject to testing errors as it is extremely susceptible to surface effects and excessively wide bandgaps.26 Meanwhile, direct measurement of the energy-level arrangement of film optoelectronic devices is difficult as they consist of a series of thin layers such as photoactive, interfacial, and electrode layers. In recent years, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) has been used widely in the field of heterojunction optoelectronic devices.27–29 This method enables calculation of the surface Fermi level distribution by obtaining the potential distribution in a certain region, which means testing the suitability of interfaces between different materials.
In this work, we demonstrate Cu2O-based heterojunction film optoelectronic devices with improved performance via incorporating a PLD Ga2O3 buffer layer. The concentration of oxygen vacancies in the Ga2O3 films can be tuned by adjusting the pressure of oxygen passing through, thus changing its bandgap, Fermi level, transmittance, and electrical conductance. These results can be obtained from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet-visible (UV-VIS) spectroscopy, current density–voltage (J–V) measurements, and KPFM analyses. Furthermore, the interfacial potential distribution between ITO/ZnO and ITO/Ga2O3 shows a stepped arrangement of ITO/ZnO/Ga2O3/Cu2O. The improved performance of heterojunction solar cells and photodetectors through faster carrier transport and less charge recombination demonstrates the advantages of the gradient energy bands after incorporation of the PLD Ga2O3 buffer layer. Furthermore, the stable self-powered Cu2O-based photodetector fabricated at low temperature and at low cost, with a high quantum efficiency and fast-response, shows strong potential in near-ultraviolet to visible-light photodetection applications.
Results and discussion
The oxygen pressure is a very important parameter when depositing oxide semiconductors using PLD. Changes in the oxygen pressure not only affect the stoichiometric ratio but also modulate the optical bandgap (Eg), carrier concentration, resistivity, and other electrical parameters of the deposited films.30,31 In this work, to obtain Ga2O3 films with suitable Eg, transmittance, conductance and Fermi levels, we deposited the films on quartz glass at 100 °C with various oxygen pressures from 10−4 Pa to 20 Pa. As shown in Fig. 1a, the high transmittance in the visible range with a sharp cut-off in the deep ultraviolet region indicates that the as-grown films are naturally transparent, except for those obtained using an oxygen pressure of 10−4 Pa. These results correspond to the absorption spectra and photographs of the Ga2O3 films shown in Fig. 1b, where there is a tendency for the Ga2O3 films deposited with increasing pressure oxygen to deepen in color, accompanied by a blue shift of the edge of absorption band towards the ultraviolet region because of the increased O/Ga ratio.

The Eg values of the Ga2O3 films were calculated from the fundamental absorption edges according to the formula:32 (αhν)2 = C (hν − Eg)(1)where α is the absorption coefficient, hν is the photon energy and C is a constant. Fig. 1c shows the Tauc plots, from which the values of Eg were estimated by extrapolating the linear section of the plot to the energy axis. As the O2 pressure increases from 10−4 Pa to 20 Pa, the Eg of the Ga2O3 films monotonously increases, with values of 4.1 eV, 4.85 eV, 5.0 eV, and 5.5 eV, respectively. The Eg of the films deposited at 1 Pa and 5 Pa are consistent with those reported for Ga2O3 films (∼4.9 eV).32,33
The elemental compositions and oxygen vacancies of the Ga2O3 films were investigated via XPS. Fig. 1d shows the survey spectra calibrated using the C1s peak at 284.8 eV. It can be seen that only peaks of O, Ga, and C (due to surface adsorbates from the air) are present in the measured XPS spectra, indicating the high purity of the deposited Ga2O3 films.33,34Fig. 1e shows the high-resolution Ga 3d XPS spectra of samples deposited at 10−4 Pa, 1 Pa, 5 Pa, and 20 Pa oxygen pressure. As the oxygen pressure increases, the XPS peaks shift towards a higher binding energy, indicating a reduction in the oxygen vacancies.35,36 The existence of oxygen vacancies will increase the local electron state density and electron cloud density of Ga, thus resulting in a decrease in the valence electron energy level of XPS. As a result, the binding energy shifts towards a higher binding energy. The high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra of the samples shown in Fig. 1f more visually reflect the increased lattice oxygen and the decreased oxygen vacancies with increasing oxygen pressure, and the fitted results are shown in Table 1. There is a correlation between the concentration of oxygen vacancies and the Fermi level position of the oxide semiconductor,24 while the concentration of oxygen vacancies ranges from 12% to 19%, indicating that the Fermi level of the Ga2O3 films varies with the amount of introduced oxygen, which can be demonstrated in the subsequent results.

The morphology and Fermi level of the Ga2O3 films prepared at different oxygen pressures were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and KPFM. Fig. 2a–d presents the surface morphology images of Ga2O3 prepared at 10−4 Pa, 1 Pa, 5 Pa, and 20 Pa oxygen pressure, respectively, and the root mean square (RMS) line distributions are shown in Fig. 2i. Fig. S1a–d (ESI†) show the corresponding AFM 3D images of these Ga2O3 films, respectively. The RMS increases from 2.26 nm to 4.9 nm with increasing oxygen pressure. Meanwhile, it can be observed that the granular morphology of Ga2O3 is basically covered when the oxygen pressure is below 5 Pa, while cracks appear when the oxygen pressure increases to 20 Pa. This result is consistent with the SEM results shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Subsequently, the surface potential images of various Ga2O3 films were employed to investigate the shift of the work function (Fermi level). It is well known that KPFM obtains the sample surface potential by measuring the contact potential difference (CPD) between the sample and the metal tip, which corresponds to their Fermi level difference. The CPD between the films and the KPFM tip (conductive PtIr-coated Sb-doped Si) can be determined using the following equations:12 VCPD = WTip − WFilm(2) EfFilm = −WFilm(3)where WTip and WFilm are the work function of the KPFM tip and the as-obtained film, respectively, and EfFilm is the Fermi level of the as-obtained film. As shown in Fig. 2e–h, the surface potential of the 10−4 Pa, 1 Pa, 5 Pa, and 20 Pa samples are −0.791 V, −0.875 V, −0.913 V, and −0.799 V, respectively, and the potential line distributions are shown in Fig. 2j. Here, highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) flakes are conventionally used to calibrate the WTip for a clean and conductive surface and a known work function of ∼4.6 eV. The surface potential of HOPG is −0.282 V, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), indicating that the Fermi levels of the various Ga2O3 samples are −4.09 eV, −4.0 eV, −3.96 eV, and −4.08 eV, respectively. The Fermi level increases with increasing surface oxygen vacancies because the defect energy level and the Fermi level have some overlap. The higher the concentration of oxygen vacancies, the wider is the energy range occupied by the defect levels and the more obvious un-localization will be, which favors the free movement of electrons. Thus, the Fermi levels of the Ga2O3 samples deposited at 1 Pa and 5 Pa oxygen pressure are higher than 20 Pa, while the exception at 10−4 Pa is due to its narrower bandgap of Ga2O3. The higher Fermi level means that it has a better match with Cu2O. Notably, the surface potential distribution of the Ga2O3 film deposited at 1 Pa oxygen pressure is the most uniform. Combined with the small roughness, the high UV-vis transmittance, moderate conductance, moderate Eg, and high Fermi level of the Ga2O3 films, the oxygen pressure of 1 Pa was determined to be the best preparation condition.

The Fermi level distribution between the interfaces gives a more intuitive reflection of their step energy band. Given that we used the architecture of ITO/ZnO/Ga2O3/Cu2O/Au, the alignment of Fermi levels between the ITO/ZnO and ITO/Ga2O3 interfaces was monitored using KPFM. As shown in Fig. 3a and e, we deposited ZnO and Ga2O3 on ITO, respectively, and then moved the KPFM test range to both interfaces and selected a scan range of 50 μm. The height sensor AFM images are shown in Fig. 3b and f, where a clear interface can be observed. Fig. 3c and g show the KPFM surface potential corresponding to the AFM images. The profiles in Fig. 3d and h reveal that the Fermi level of ZnO is 110 mV higher than ITO, while Ga2O3 is 850 mV higher than ITO. Due to the high conduction band of Cu2O, the large Fermi level difference between Ga2O3 and ITO means a close conduction band between Ga2O3 and Cu2O.

All the morphologies and surface potentials of the films are shown in Fig. 4a–h. These films have a similar surface topography and close surface roughness. The Fermi levels of commercial ITO, ZnO, Ga2O3, and Cu2O are −4.76 eV, −4.64 eV, −4.09 eV, and −4.90 eV, respectively. Fig. 4i shows the stepped arrangement surface potential line distributions of Cu2O, Ga2O3, ZnO, and commercial ITO, indicating a graded heterojunction for ZnO/Ga2O3/Cu2O. These results corresponding to the interfacial KPFM results shown in Fig. 3. On this basis, we drew a diagram of the energy-level arrangement.16,37,38 As shown in Fig. 4j, the conduction band minimum of Ga2O3 is located between those of Cu2O and ZnO, and the stepped energy band structure is conducive to charge transfer. After photogenerated electrons are generated, they are first transported through the conduction band of Cu2O to the conduction band of Ga2O3, and then to the conduction band of ZnO. Meanwhile, Ga2O3 has a deep valence band maximum due to its wide bandgap, which is conductive to blocking the electron–hole recombination. As a consequence, all optoelectronic parameters are enhanced when Ga2O3 is inserted as a buffer layer in heterojunction optoelectronic devices, as shown in subsequent results.

Fig. 5a shows a schematic diagram of the heterojunction solar cell with an architecture of ITO/ZnO/Ga2O3/Cu2O/Au. For comparison, two other device architectures of ITO/ZnO/Cu2O/Au and ITO/Ga2O3/Cu2O/Au were fabricated. All Cu2O films were prepared using PLD at 1 Pa oxygen pressure, as this condition gave a pure phase Cu2O with the highest mobility shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†) and Table 1. All the dark I–V curves shown in Fig. 5b display nonlinear rectification characteristics, while the architectures of Ga2O3/Cu2O and ZnO/Ga2O3/Cu2O exhibit a larger rectification ratio because the serious leakage of the ZnO/Cu2O architecture was suppressed by the Ga2O3 film deposited, revealing there are well-behaved p–n junction diodes. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the best-performing devices with the ITO/Ga2O3 (deposited with various oxygen pressure)/Cu2O/Au architecture, confirming that the 1 Pa oxygen pressure is the optimal condition. (The devices were short-circuited when the oxygen pressure was 20 Pa.) Since the oxygen pressure is 1 Pa, the Ga2O3 film not only has a suitable bandgap and Fermi level but also has an appreciable n-type conductivity with good optical transmittance. The variation of electrical conductivity is examined through measuring the current–voltage characteristics for the structure of In/Ga2O3/In using various oxygen pressures to prepare Ga2O3. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), devices with Ga2O3 prepared with oxygen at 10−4 Pa and 1 Pa present higher slopes than those for 5 Pa and 20 Pa, indicating its better electron transport, which is consistent with the KPFM results. Although the conductivity values of Ga2O3 prepared at an oxygen pressure of 10−4 Pa and 1 Pa are close, the more suitable bandgap and Fermi level of Ga2O3 at 1 Pa suppress the electron–hole recombination, resulting in a better performance of the prepared photovoltaic devices. Fig S7 (ESI†) shows the J–V characteristics of the devices with various architectures and Table S1 (ESI†) summarizes the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. Ga2O3 insertion significantly improved all photovoltaic parameters, especially the short-circuit current density (JSC) and the FF, which benefited from the lower leakage current and better charge-transfer capability of the gradient heterojunction. The architectures of ZnO/Cu2O and Ga2O3/Cu2O yielded a champion PCE of 0.38% and 0.66%, while the architecture of ZnO/Ga2O3/Cu2O delivered the highest PCE of 0.94% with a VOC of 0.34 V, a JSC of 4.99 mA cm−2, and an FF of 51.6%. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra shown in Fig. 5c demonstrate a 66% quantum efficiency improvement, indicating an enhanced carrier transport. To gain further insight into the mechanism of the performance enhancement through the use of different architectures, we characterized the charge-transfer kinetics and charge recombination through the biased EQE spectra, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and capacitance–voltage (C–V) profiling.37

(f) EIS Nyquist plots of Cu2O-based solar cells with different architectures conducted in the dark at the −0.35 V bias voltage. 

Fig. 5d shows the ratio of EQE (−0.5 V) to EQE (0 V) as a function of the wavelength. The EQE ratio for the architecture of ZnO/Cu2O strongly depends on the bias, and indicates a poorer collection of photo-generated carriers compared with the architecture of ZnO/Ga2O3/Cu2O. The change of the EQE occurs predominantly in the long-wavelength range, which indicates that the photogenerated carrier collection relies considerably on the drift in the depletion region. The built-in potential (Vbi) of p–n junction devices was explored through C–V profiling. Fig. 5e shows a 0.05 V variation of Vbi for devices with different architectures, indicating an enhanced built-in electric field achieved by inserting the Ga2O3 film. This reduces the charge accumulation at the p–n junction interface and hence an increased VOC of approximately 0.05 V. EIS measurements were conducted in the dark biased at −0.35 V, and the experimental results are shown in Fig. 5f. The device architectures of ITO/ZnO/Ga2O3/Cu2O/Au and ITO/Ga2O3/Cu2O/Au exhibit a larger recombination resistance (Rrec) than that architecture of ITO/ZnO/Cu2O/Au, indicating suppressed interfacial recombination due to the wide bandgap of Ga2O3. The carrier-transport schematic diagram is shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), and where Ga2O3 is located between the conduction bands of Cu2O and ZnO, the electrons can pass through the stepped energy levels provided by Ga2O3, which not only greatly improves the charge-transfer efficiency, but also blocks electron–hole recombination. Therefore, the obtained devices exhibit a better performance.
The temporal photo-response results of the ITO/Ga2O3 (deposited with various oxygen pressures)/Cu2O/Au architecture shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†) also confirm that the 1 Pa oxygen pressure is the optimal condition. Therefore, we constructed photodetectors with Ga2O3 films deposited at 1 Pa oxygen pressure. The temporal photo-response curves of the different device architectures shown in Fig. 6a–c were measured with a light intensity of 350 mW cm−2. As mentioned above, the response current increases further when Ga2O3 is inserted as a buffer layer between ZnO and Cu2O, indicating that the gradient heterojunction is beneficial for improving the sensitivity of the photodetector. Moreover, the photodetector architecture of ITO/ZnO/Ga2O3/Cu2O/Au in Fig. 6c exhibits a short rise/fall time (1 ms/1 ms); an expanded region of this is shown in Fig. 6d, which reveals that the rise/fall time is much faster than previously reported Cu2O-film-based photodetectors because of the better charge-transfer capability of the gradient heterojunction.11,13,20,39,40Fig. 6e shows the responsivity (R) as a function of wavelength at 0 V. R can be evaluated from the following equation:41 (4)where Ip and Id are the photocurrent and the dark current, respectively, P is the incident light intensity, and A is the active area of the device (0.0314 cm2). The device exhibits a high responsivity in the ultraviolet-visible range, especially in the range of 300–450 nm. The highest R measured at 0 V is estimated to be 24 mA W−1 at 380 nm for a light intensity of 45 μW cm−2. Fig. 6f demonstrates the steadily decreasing photoresponse under 405 nm illumination and fixing 0 V bias, with decreasing light intensity from 344 mW cm−2 to 30.1 μW cm−2. The linear dynamic range (LDR) is defined as the relative ratio of the photocurrent to the dark current, which reflects the signal-to-noise ratio.41Fig. 6g displays the linearity feature of the logarithmic light intensity–photocurrent curves, illustrating a large LDR of 120 for the ITO/ZnO/Ga2O3/Cu2O/Au photodetector. Fig. 6h shows the superior stable cycling characteristics of this photodetector. The responsive photocurrent maintained 100% of its initial value after 3000 s of continuous operation under 405 nm laser illumination at 350 mW cm−2.

To investigate the long-term stability, the device was kept unencapsulated in ambient air for 4 months. The fade-free performance shown in Fig. 6i demonstrates the excellent long-term stability of the photodetector.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we have developed Cu2O-based heterojunction film optoelectronic devices with an improved performance via incorporating a PLD-generated Ga2O3 buffer layer. The oxygen vacancy concentration of the Ga2O3 films was regulated by adjusting the incoming oxygen pressure during PLD, and a suitable bandgap, optical transmittance, electrical conductance, and Fermi level of Ga2O3 were obtained when the oxygen pressure is 1 Pa. Furthermore, a stepped-arrangement for the energy levels of the ITO/ZnO/Ga2O3/Cu2O/Au architecture improved the performance of the heterojunction devices through faster carrier transport and less charge recombination, where the response time and responsivity of the visible-light photodetector were 1 ms and 24 mA cm−1, respectively, and a quantum efficiency enhancement of 66% was achieved for the Cu2O-based film solar cell. The photocurrent of the photodetector that was kept unencapsulated in ambient air for 4 months maintained 99% of its initial value. Our research provides a new approach for developing low-temperature-prepared self-powered near-ultraviolet–visible-light photodetectors with low cost, high quantum efficiency, and fast response with excellent long-term stability.
Experimental section
Materials
All targets, including ZnO (99.99%), Ga2O3 (99.99%), and Cu2O (99.99%), were purchased from ZhongNuo Advanced Material Technology Co., Ltd, and the ITO glass was purchased from South China Science & Technology Co., Ltd.
Solar cell and photodetector fabrication
30 nm Ga2O3, 30 nm ZnO, and 500 nm Cu2O films were deposited in sequence onto ITO glass via pulsed laser deposition (PLD) using a KrF excimer laser with a laser focus size of 0.06 cm2. At 100 °C, the ZnO (99.99%) target was ablated at a 2 Pa oxygen pressure for 10 min using the KrF excimer laser with an energy of 200 mJ per pulse and a frequency of 5 Hz. Subsequently, the Ga2O3 films were sequentially deposited onto ITO/ZnO under the following respective deposition conditions: 100 °C, 200 mJ per pulse, 5 Hz, 10−4 Pa to 20 Pa oxygen, and 10 min. Then, the Cu2O film was deposited onto ITO/ZnO/Ga2O3 under the following deposition conditions: 100 °C, 200 mJ per pulse, 5 Hz, 1 Pa, and 60 min. The Cu2O film prepared under these conditions has the highest hole mobility, as shown in Table S2 (ESI†). An 80-nm-thick gold counter electrode was thermally evaporated on ITO/ZnO/Ga2O3/Cu2O under a vacuum of 2 × 10−6 mbar.
Characterization
The transmittance and absorption spectra of the Ga2O3 films were recorded using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (SHIMADZU mini1280). Top-view SEM images were observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM; JSM 6700F, Japan). AFM height images and KPFM images were obtained in an ambient atmosphere using a Bruker Dimension Icon XR instrument. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using a Thermo Scientific (Escalab 250Xi) spectrometer. The crystal structure was determined via 2θ scan X-ray diffraction (Rigku Smartlab, Japan). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured under simulated air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) radiation (100 mW cm−2 irradiance) using a 450 W xenon lamp (Newport) and recorded with an electrochemical workstation (Shanghai Chenhua Instruments, China, CHI660D). EQE spectra were measured using a QE/IPCE system (Enli Technology Co. Ltd). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using the same electrochemical workstation over the frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz with 10 mV AC amplitude at −0.35 V bias potential in the dark. Capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were performed using the same electrochemical workstation at 10 kHz with −0.2 to 1 V bias. A small AC voltage of 20 mV was used for probing the actual capacitance at a given bias. All the dark current–voltage (I–V) and temporal response curves were recorded using a Keysight B2912A Precision Sources/Measure Unit. The measurement of spectral responses was carried out using a xenon arc lamp (Newport) as the light source and a monochromator to obtain homogeneous light. Operational stability was also recorded using the B2912A unit with a laser diode (405 nm) as the light source. The intensity of the incident light was calibrated using a standard Si detector.
