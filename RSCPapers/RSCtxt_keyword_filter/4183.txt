The concepts of the present PECV cells will open a new way for converting a large portion of the bandgap energy into photovoltage, and splitting water using semiconductor materials unstable in water.
Introduction
Solar energy harvesting in the form of storable and conveyable chemical energy via photocatalytic or photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting has been regarded as a key technology to overcome energy and climate issues.1 Although wide-gap oxide photocatalyst materials have already achieved a very high apparent quantum yield up to 70% for the overall water splitting in the ultraviolet region,2 the overall water splitting using a powder suspension system of single photocatalysts under visible light irradiation is rarely reported.3 The following thermodynamic and kinetic challenges are considered to limit the feasibility of such photocatalysis: (1) the energy levels of the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) should be more negative and positive than the hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution potentials, respectively; (2) the photoexcited minority carrier has to drive a multi-electron process of water splitting; and (3) the photocatalytic materials must stably function in aqueous media.1 PEC water splitting using a photoanode and/or a photocathode is another method.4 For instance, the BiVO4 (BVO) photoanode is well-known as a promising material for water oxidation due to the relatively negative onset potential for the anodic photocurrent around 0.1–0.2 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE).5 Here, while the onset potential might be affected by the conditions of the electrolyte, the difference between the onset potential of the photoanode and the reversible oxygen electrode (1.23 VRHE) should represent the “photovoltage” generated by the photoanode. In this regard, the photovoltage generated by BVO is equal to approximately 1.13 V, which is equivalent to 47% of the bandgap energy of BVO (2.4 eV). Narrow-gap photoanodes, such as Ta3N5 and BaTaO2N (BTON), showed more positive onset potentials, typically around 0.6 VRHE,6 where the photovoltages are equivalent to only 30% of their bandgap energies. Meanwhile, in the case of near-infrared (IR) responsive photocathodes, such as Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGS),7 their photovoltages (difference between the onset potential and RHE) correspond to only 50–60% of the bandgap energies. As one of the few examples converting nearly 70% of the bandgap energy into photovoltage during hydrogen evolution, the (ZnSe)0.85(CuIn0.7Ga0.3Se2)0.15 thin film photocathode is reported to exhibit a positive onset potential of ∼0.9 VRHE.8 Nevertheless, surface defects or kinetic challenges may hamper efficient utilization of a large portion of the bandgap energy as the photovoltage during direct water oxidation and/or reduction at the semiconductor surface.
Another strategy for solar hydrogen production is using the electric power generated by photovoltaics (PVs) for driving the water electrolysis at the external circuit.9 In the case of conventional single-junction solid-state PVs, such as Si, CIGS, and CdTe,10 the bandgap energy of the semiconductor is usually designed to be ∼1.4 eV for generating a photovoltage of 0.8–0.9 V based on the traditional theory of the Shockley–Queisser limit.11 Typical CIGS-based PVs, with an In/(In + Ga) ratio of 0.7, can generate an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of ∼0.75 V, which is equivalent to ∼68% of the bandgap energy (1.1 eV).12 The cutting-edge CdTe-based PVs have recently been reported to exhibit a VOC as high as 1.0 V, which corresponds to 67% of the bandgap energy (1.5 eV).10b,13 Additionally, PEC cells, such as dye-sensitized solar cells and perovskite solar cells, have also attracted great attention as low-cost PVs with comparable efficiencies to those of conventional solid-state PVs.9a,14 However, because the maximum photovoltages thermodynamically expected for such kinds of PEC cells reflect the difference between the Fermi-level of the semiconductor (typically TiO2) and equilibrium potential of the redox pair (typically I−/I3−), their VOCs are also limited to a maximum of around 1.0 V.15 Despite the significant development of electric conversion efficiencies of such solid-state and PEC cells, the obtained photovoltage from a single-junction unit is limited to a maximum of around 1 V. Since water splitting at ambient temperature and pressure thermodynamically requires at least 1.23 V, the typical PVs cannot decompose water without the series-connection of PVs and/or a complicated external circuit such as batteries and converters.16
Previously, a new type of photoelectrochemical-voltaic (PECV) cell consisting of a single crystalline CdS photoanode and a Pt cathode in a nonaqueous electrolyte containing tris(2,2′-bipyridine)ruthenium complexes (Ru(bpy)32+/3+) was reported to generate a VOC as high as 1.4–1.6 V via a one-step bandgap photoexcitation under visible-light irradiation (see Fig. 1).17 In this system, the VOC is determined by the difference between the onset potential for the photoanode (≃flat-band potential; EFB) and the redox equilibrium potential in the electrolyte as shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, the PECV cell consisting of a photoanode with a negative CBM and a redox pair with a positive potential is expected to generate a high photovoltage. Since the CdS photoanode drives the one-electron redox reaction, i.e., oxidation of the Ru2+ complex, kinetic challenges at the photoelectrode surface as mentioned above are also expected to be mitigated. Furthermore, photocorrosion of the CdS photoanode in aqueous media may also be suppressed in a nonaqueous electrolyte.17a Indeed, this was the first example of generating a higher photovoltage than the thermodynamic onset voltage for water splitting (1.23 V) via a one-step photoexcitation under visible-light irradiation, to the best of our knowledge. In the future, it will be feasible to use this nonaqueous-type PECV to split water by a one-step photoexcitation by simply connecting to appropriate electrocatalysts, even using semiconductor materials incapable of directly splitting water due to their instability in water. However, the obtained photovoltage was equivalent to approximately 63% of the bandgap energy of CdS (2.4 eV), suggesting that there is still room for improving the VOC and/or narrowing the bandgap. In addition, the single crystalline wafer used as a photoanode in the previous study should be essentially unsuitable for energy conversion due to the mm-order thickness as well as high cost. Therefore, construction of PECV cells using a polycrystalline narrow-gap semiconductor should be one promising approach to improve the efficiencies of the cells.

In this study, particulate photoanodes consisting of a solid solution of ZnSe and CdSe (ZnxCd1−xSe) were applied to PECV cells with a high photovoltage exceeding 1.23 V. Such II−VI chalcogenides potentially possess attractive features as photocatalysts or photoanodes, such as n-type semiconductivity, intense absorption in the visible light region, and a suitable band structure for water splitting, that is, straddling the potential window of water.18 In addition, the bandgap energy and band position of ZnxCd1−xSe are easily tuned according to the Zn/Cd ratio up to the near-IR region (∼750 nm) in a stepwise manner. However, these materials usually suffer from photocorrosion in water.1a ZnxCd1−xSe-based quantum dots or core–shell nanowires composed of a ZnO core and ZnxCd1−xSe shell have been reported to have applications in optoelectronics or as photoanodes in PEC cells, respectively.19 For the previously reported ZnxCd1−xSe-based PEC cells, the obtained photovoltages were still limited to approximately 0.6 V.19b In the present study, since the photovoltage of the nonaqueous PECV cells is determined by the difference between the onset potential of the photoanode and redox equilibrium potential, the photovoltage generated by the cell can be maximized to obtain the target voltage (>1.23 V) by tuning the band edge position at the photoanode–electrolyte interface according to the Zn/Cd composition. Indeed, the PECV cell consisting of a Zn0.25Cd0.75Se photoanode in an acetonitrile electrolyte containing Ru complexes as the redox shuttle exhibits a photovoltage of 1.32 V, which is equivalent to as high as 72% bandgap energy for Zn0.25Cd0.75Se (1.84 eV). To clarify the origin of the high photovoltage in the present system, the expected energy diagrams at the interface between a ZnxCd1−xSe photoanode and a nonaqueous electrolyte are proposed. The contribution of the nonaqueous environment to the durability of the material, compared to that in aqueous media, is also discussed. The present study will develop a new approach to convert a large portion of the bandgap energy into photovoltage exceeding the thermodynamic onset voltage for water splitting (1.23 V) using semiconductor materials incapable of directly splitting water.
Experimental
Preparation of particulate ZnxCd1−xSe photoanodes
ZnxCd1−xSe particles were synthesized via a solid-state reaction in a sealed quartz ampoule. ZnSe and CdSe were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Wako Pure Chemical Industries, respectively. The ZnSe and CdSe powders were mixed in a nitrogen-filled glovebox at the Zn/(Zn + Cd) molar ratio = x = 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0. The mixture was then sealed in a quartz ampoule and heated at 600 °C for 15 h. The synthesis temperature was separately optimized as described in the ESI.†
Photoanodes comprising ZnxCd1−xSe particles were then fabricated by the particle transfer (PT) method.20 The obtained particulate solid solutions were coated on a glass substrate by drop casting a suspension of the semiconductor powder in isopropanol, then drying in air. A Ta contact layer and a Ti conductor layer were then sequentially deposited on the semiconductor layer by radio frequency-magnetron sputtering. During the deposition of the backside metal electrode layer, the temperature of the glass substrate coated with ZnxCd1−xSe particles was kept at 200 °C. The obtained assembly consisting of semiconductor particles anchored on the metal layer (ZnxCd1−xSe/Ta/Ti) was used as a photoanode after removing excessive particles by sonication and fixing the layers on a secondary glass substrate by carbon tape or epoxy resin.
Characterization of ZnxCd1−xSe particles
The crystalline structure of the ZnxCd1−xSe particles was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD; Rigaku, Miniflex300) using the Cu Kα line. The optical properties of the particles were evaluated using a UV-visible diffuse reflectance (DR) spectrometer (DRS; Jasco, V-670). The structural and elemental analyses of the ZnxCd1−xSe particles were carried out by using scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS; Hitachi, SU8000). The energy level of the VBM for the ZnxCd1−xSe particles was measured using photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA; Riken Keiki, AC-3).
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) and [Ru(bpy)3](PF6)2 were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry and Sigma-Aldrich, and used as the supporting electrolyte and redox shuttle, respectively, without further purification. The [Ru(bpy)3]3+ complex was prepared by the electrochemical oxidation of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ at a Pt mesh electrode, as described in Fig. S1 and S2,† such that the total concentration of the Ru complexes was 2 mM at a [Ru(bpy)3]2+/[Ru(bpy)3]3+ ratio of one.17a The acetonitrile electrolyte was purged by Ar prior to the measurements, and vigorously stirred during the measurements. A commercially available Ag/Ag+ electrode equipped with an acetonitrile electrolyte junction and a Pt black-coated Pt coil were used as the reference and counter electrodes, respectively, during the PEC measurements in a nonaqueous electrolyte. The current–potential curves were acquired using a typical three-electrode setup, whereas the PV properties were assessed in a two-electrode setup. The PEC cell configuration is described in Fig. S1.† To determine the redox equilibrium potential of [Ru(bpy)3]2+/3+ and ferrocene in the acetonitrile electrolyte, a commercial Pt disk electrode was used as the working electrode. During the PEC measurements in an aqueous electrolyte with a sacrificial reagent, an aqueous solution containing 0.25 M K2HPO4, 0.25 M KH2PO4, and 1 M Na2SO3, with a pH of approximately 7.5, was used as the electrolyte. It should be noted that a 0.25 M K2HPO4/0.25 M KH2PO4 solution (pH = 6.9) was used as the aqueous electrolyte without a sacrificial reagent. The aqueous electrolyte was purged with Ar and vigorously stirred during the measurements. A Pt coil and Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively, in a typical three-electrode setup. Simulated sunlight adjusted to AM 1.5G was used as the light source, while a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a monochromator was used during the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements.
Results and discussion
Characteristics of ZnxCd1−xSe powder
XRD patterns of the ZnxCd1−xSe particles synthesized by a solid-state reaction with various Zn/(Zn + Cd) ratios, x, are displayed in Fig. 2(a). The ZnxCd1−xSe samples with high Zn contents, x = 0.5–1, showed an almost single-phase zincblende-type structure, whereas the Cd-rich specimens, x = 0 and 0.25, possessed the wurtzite-type structure. As described in the ESI,† ZnxCd1−xSe synthesized at a relatively low temperature (500 °C) showed a phase separation into the alloy and the precursor, while almost single-phase alloys were successfully synthesized at higher temperatures (600–800 °C) (see Fig. S3(a) and (b)†). The higher synthesis temperature resulted in better crystallinity (high diffraction intensity and small full-width-at-half-maximum). The diffraction peaks gradually shifted to the low-angle side according to the decreasing x, that is, lower contents of Zn and higher contents of Cd. The cell volumes of the alloys also gradually increased with the increase in the amount of Cd as shown in Fig. 2(b). When x = 0.5–1.0, that is, when the alloys possess the zincblende-type structure, the cell volumes of ZnxCd1−xSe as a function of x showed a linear relationship according to the Vegard's law. These shifts in the diffraction peaks and variation of the cell volumes were consistent with the difference between the ionic radii of Zn2+ (75 pm) and Cd2+ (92 pm) in a four-coordinated state. Thus, the successful formation of a solid solution of ZnSe (zincblende structure) and CdSe (wurtzite structure) was confirmed. The DR spectra and the corresponding Tauc plots for ZnxCd1−xSe are presented in Fig. 2(c) and (d), respectively. The absorption edge gradually red-shifted according to the increasing Cd content from approximately 480 nm (x = 1) to 750 nm (x = 0), which were equivalent to the bandgap energy of 2.57 eV and 1.66 eV, respectively. As shown in the Tauc plots, all the solid solutions showed a direct band gap. The weak absorption at wavelengths longer than the absorption edge might suggest the presence of some defects. The synthesis temperature hardly affected the optical properties of the obtained particles as shown in Fig. S3(c).†

The morphology of the ZnxCd1−xSe particles barely changed according to the Zn/Cd ratio, as seen in the SEM images (Fig. 3(a)–(e)). The ZnxCd1−xSe particles showed rugged and irregular shapes with a wide ranging particle size distribution from the submicron to micron-order. EDS revealed that the compositions of the obtained particles, Zn/(Zn + Cd) and Se/(Zn + Cd), were almost consistent with the amounts of the precursors (see Fig. 3(f)). The amounts of Se seemed slightly lower than the stoichiometry. Such an anion vacancy might act as a donor.

The PEC characteristics of the particulate ZnxCd1−xSe photoanodes were first evaluated in an aqueous electrolyte containing a sacrificial reagent (Na2SO3) as summarized in Fig. 4(a). It should be noted that because the photoanode fabricated from the alloy synthesized at 600 °C showed the highest photocurrent among the present alloys prepared at different temperatures (Fig. S4†), the PEC performances for ZnxCd1−xSe synthesized at 600 °C were then evaluated. The ZnxCd1−xSe particles were fabricated into the shape of a photoelectrode via the PT method as reported elsewhere.20 The aqueous electrolyte is almost transparent in the visible light region, while an acetonitrile electrolyte containing Ru complexes shows visible light absorption, which should interfere with the bandgap photoexcitation of the photoanodes.17a In addition, decomposition of the sacrificial reagent is kinetically and thermodynamically much easier than water oxidation as well as photocorrosion. Therefore, the PEC performances in such a sacrificial aqueous electrolyte should reflect the expected maximum photocurrent obtained by the present materials, which only involve the physical process inside the semiconductor with negligible influences of the electrolyte colour, kinetics of the PEC reaction at the photoanode surface, and photocorrosion. The ZnxCd1−xSe photoanodes with x = 0.25–1 showed an anodic photocurrent from approximately −0.1 VRHE, while the onset potential of the CdSe (x = 0) photoanode was positively shifted in the vicinity of 0 VRHE. The anodic photocurrent gradually increased according to the applied potential, and reached 1.2, 3.0, 3.8, 5.8, and 7.9 mA cm−2 at 0.7 VRHE for x = 1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, and 0, respectively. The increasing anodic photocurrent according to the increased Cd contents is consistent with the red-shift of the absorption edge as discussed in Fig. 2(c) and (d). However, the fill-factor of the current–potential curve for CdSe was obviously lower than that for the other cases. The reduced onset potential and fill-factor for the CdSe photoanode, compared to that of other compositions, should be attributed to the extreme positive shift of the CBM as discussed later. In addition, the onset potential for the ZnxCd1−xSe photoanodes gradually shifted to a negative potential according to the increased light intensity and finally almost saturated as summarized in Fig. 4(b). The loss of photovoltage, that is, a positive shift of the onset potential under illumination of weak light in the present cases, due to the nonradiative recombination at the photoelectrode–electrolyte interface becomes less prominent under intense light illumination, since the surface trap states are filled by the photogenerated carriers.21 This indicated that the surface of the present ZnxCd1−xSe photoanodes is significantly defective, and that the passivation of such surface defects by multilayer structuring should be necessary to further improve the onset potential as well as the photocurrent of the present photoanodes in the future. Nevertheless, considering both the photocurrent and onset potential, the Zn0.25Cd0.75Se photoanode can be expected to be suitable for application in PECV cells.

An aqueous solution containing 0.5 M potassium phosphate, 0.25 M K2HPO4/0.25 M KH2PO4, and a sacrificial reagent, 1 M Na2SO3, was used as the electrolyte. The photoanodes were prepared by the PT method using a Ta contact layer and Ti conductor layer. Simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G) and a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with appropriate neutral density filters was used as the light source for (a) and (b), respectively. 
PEC performances in a nonaqueous electrolyte
Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) for a Pt electrode in an acetonitrile electrolyte containing 2 mM [Ru(bpy)3]2+/3+ and 0.1 M TBAPF6 were obtained at various scan rates, i.e., 10, 50, and 100 mV s−1 as described in Fig. 5(a). The redox solution with Ru2+/Ru3+ = 1 was prepared by the electrochemical oxidation of [Ru(bpy)3]2+. The potential in the nonaqueous electrolyte is described in the units of V vs. the equilibrium potential for ferrocene and ferrocenium ions (V vs. Fc/Fc+) hereafter. The CVs for Pt in an acetonitrile electrolyte containing 1 mM ferrocene are provided in Fig. S5† as a reference. The redox equilibrium potential for [Ru(bpy)3]2+/3+ was estimated to be 0.89 V vs. Fc/Fc+ from the middle point between the oxidation peak and reduction peak. The peak separation between the oxidation and reduction peaks was 74 mV regardless of the scan rate, indicating a nearly ideal reversible one-electron reaction. Based on the oxidation peak current at each scan rate, the diffusion coefficient of [Ru(bpy)3]2+ was estimated to be approximately 9.2 × 10−6 cm2 s−1, which was in a similar order to the reported value.22

(c) Current–voltage curves and (d) voltage–time curves for the PECV cells consisting of ZnxCd1−xSe photoanodes and Pt cathodes in acetonitrile electrolyte. (d) The voltage–current curves were acquired under open-circuit conditions (current density = 0). Simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G) was used as the light source. 
Meanwhile, the anodic photocurrent for the particulate ZnxCd1−xSe photoanodes appeared at 0.18, −0.10, −0.42, −0.42, and −0.34 V vs. Fc/Fc+ for x = 1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, and 0, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The anodic photocurrent increased according to the applied potential and reached 0.04, 0.28, 1.4, 1.5, and 4.4 mA cm−2 at 0.5 V vs. Fc/Fc+ for x = 1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, and 0, respectively, under simulated sunlight irradiation. The anodic photocurrent obtained for the ZnxCd1−xSe photoanodes significantly decreased compared to the photocurrent observed in an aqueous electrolyte containing a sacrificial reagent (see Fig. 4). The decreasing photocurrent in a nonaqueous electrolyte should be attributed to light absorption by the Ru complexes, whose absorption bands are positioned at 280 and 450 nm.23 The light shielding by the complexes caused the decrease in apparent quantum efficiencies for the ZnxCd1−xSe photoanodes especially in the shorter wavelength region. Evidently, the photocurrent as well as the onset potential of the relatively wide-gap materials, such as ZnSe and Zn0.75Cd0.25Se, was very strongly affected by visible light absorption of the Ru complexes. The onset potentials of such wide-gap materials are strangely positive, considering their relatively negative CBM, possibly due to the surface defects as discussed in Fig. 4(b). The light shielding by the Ru complexes caused not only a decreased photocurrent of the wide-gap photoanodes but also a positive shift of the onset potential due to the reduced light intensity that reaches the photoanode surface. Nevertheless, the differences between the redox equilibrium potential for [Ru(bpy)3]2+/3+ at the Pt electrode and the onset potentials for ZnSe, Zn0.75Cd0.25Se, Zn0.5Cd0.5Se, Zn0.25Cd0.75Se, and CdSe photoanodes were 0.71, 0.99, 1.3, 1.3, and 1.2 V, respectively, which can be expected as VOCs of the PECV cells comprising the corresponding ZnxCd1−xSe photoanodes and Pt cathode.
Current–voltage profiles of the PECV cells measured in a two-electrode setup are provided in Fig. 5(c). It should be noted that the Pt black-coated Pt coil electrode with a high surface area was used as a cathode to avoid the diffusion limitation. The VOCs obtained from the PECVs consisting of ZnSe, Zn0.75Cd0.25Se, Zn0.5Cd0.5Se, Zn0.25Cd0.75Se, and CdSe photoanodes were 0.71, 1.0, 1.32, 1.32, and 1.21 V, respectively, which were consistent with the results of the PEC measurements in the three-electrode setup as already discussed. Importantly, in the case of x = 0.5 and 0.75, a VOC of 1.3 V is obviously higher than that of the conventional solid-state PVs and other types of PEC cells,10,14 as well as the thermodynamic onset voltage for water splitting (1.23 V). Moreover, the obtained photovoltages are equivalent to 28, 45, 67, 72, and 73% of the bandgap energy of ZnSe, Zn0.75Cd0.25Se, Zn0.5Cd0.5Se, Zn0.25Cd0.75Se, and CdSe, respectively. Compared to the conventional PVs and direct PEC water splitting,5–7,10,14 converting much more than 70% bandgap energy into photovoltage is unique. As clearly shown in Fig. 5(d), the present PECV cells consisting of ZnxCd1−xSe photoanodes can generate stable photovoltage, rather than a transitional photoresponse. Therefore, it can be concluded that PECV cells, which are capable of generating photovoltages higher than the thermodynamic onset voltage for water splitting and converting a large portion of the bandgap energy into photovoltage, can be successfully constructed using particulate ZnxCd1−xSe photoanodes in a nonaqueous electrolyte.
The IPCE spectrum of the Zn0.25Cd0.75Se photoanode at an applied potential of 0.5 V vs. Fc/Fc+ is compiled with the absorption spectra of Zn0.25Cd0.75Se and the nonaqueous electrolyte containing [Ru(bpy)3]2+/3+ in Fig. 6. The onset of anodic photocurrent is observed in the vicinity of 700 nm and agrees well with the absorption edge of the Zn0.25Cd0.75Se particles, supporting the fact that the photocurrent definitely originated from the bandgap photoexcitation of the semiconductor and that the weak light absorption in the longer wavelength region than the absorption edge did not contribute to the PEC reaction. On the other hand, the nonaqueous electrolyte containing [Ru(bpy)3]2+/3+ showed a very strong light absorption at 400–500 nm,23 which should cause the drastic decrease of the IPCE for the Zn0.25Cd0.75Se photoanode in the wavelength range of less than 600 nm. These observations are also consistent with the experimental results that the anodic photocurrent obviously decreased in a nonaqueous electrolyte compared to the case in an aqueous electrolyte, and that relatively wide-gap materials were very strongly affected, as discussed in Fig. 5. Although the decrease of the IPCE due to light shielding by the redox pair should be one important issue to be solved for further improvement of the PV performances, it also suggests that the photoexcitation of the Ru complexes did not contribute to the PEC reaction and that the present PECV cells were certainly driven by the one-step photoexcitation of Zn0.25Cd0.75Se.

To evaluate the contribution of the nonaqueous environment to the durability of the material, the PEC properties of the Zn0.25Cd0.75Se photoanode were determined in an aqueous solution containing a sacrificial reagent (1 M Na2SO3 with 0.5 M potassium phosphate as a supporting electrolyte), an aqueous electrolyte without a sacrificial reagent (containing only a supporting electrolyte, 0.5 M potassium phosphate), and a nonaqueous electrolyte containing the Ru complexes as summarized in Fig. 7. To compare the PEC properties measured in different environments (aqueous or nonaqueous) from the standpoint of the photovoltage, the potential is described in the units of V vs. the reversible redox potential, that is, V vs. H2O/O2 (=1.23 VRHE) or V vs. Ru2+/Ru3+ (=0.89 V vs. Fc/Fc+) for results obtained in the aqueous or nonaqueous electrolyte, respectively. Comparing the cases with a sacrificial aqueous electrolyte and nonaqueous electrolyte (see Fig. 7(a)), the Zn0.25Cd0.75Se photoanode showed a similar photovoltage possibly due to the thermodynamically and/or kinetically easy reaction (decomposition of the sacrificial reagent or oxidation of [Ru(bpy)3]2+), although the photocurrent in the nonaqueous electrolyte is significantly lower due to light shielding by the Ru complexes, as already discussed. In contrast, the Zn0.25Cd0.75Se photoanode in an aqueous electrolyte without a sacrificial reagent showed a significantly reduced photocurrent and onset potential compared to the photoanode in a sacrificial aqueous electrolyte. This should be attributed to the photocorrosion that occurred on the photoanode rather than water oxidation in the aqueous electrolyte without a sacrificial reagent. Furthermore, the current–time curves for the photoanode in an aqueous electrolyte without a sacrificial reagent and in a nonaqueous electrolyte are compiled in Fig. 7(b). The anodic photocurrent generated by the Zn0.25Cd0.75Se photoanode in an acetonitrile electrolyte containing the Ru complexes gradually decreased to almost 60% of the initial value after 10 min of light irradiation, possibly due to water remaining in the acetonitrile solvent. On the other hand, the anodic photocurrent in an aqueous electrolyte suddenly decreased by 50% during the initial 30 s of light irradiation. The typical photocorrosion of such chalcogenide materials involves the oxidation of the chalcogen anions accompanied by the elution of the metal cations into the solvent.24 The Gibbs free energies to transfer Cd2+ and Zn2+ from water into acetonitrile have been reported to be in the range of 12–42 kJ mol−1 and 26–67 kJ mol−1, respectively,25 indicating that these cations should be stable in water rather than in acetonitrile. The instability of the cations in acetonitrile electrolyte should contribute to the improved durability of the photoanode in a nonaqueous electrolyte, compared to the case of an aqueous electrolyte. Thus, it can be concluded that although further suppression of the degradation should be necessary to establish stable PECV cells in the future, the nonaqueous environment in the present PECV cells should be beneficial to stably utilize the semiconductor materials incapable of directly splitting water.

Based on the energy level of the VBM directly measured by PESA (see Fig. S6†) and the optical bandgap energy determined using the Tauc plots (see Fig. 2(d)), the band edge potentials of ZnxCd1−xSe vs. Fc/Fc+, the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), and the vacuum level are proposed in Fig. 8. For the calculation, −4.98 eV vs. the vacuum level was employed as the reversible redox potential of Fc/Fc+.26 The redox equilibrium potential for [Ru(bpy)3]2+/3+ (determined from CVs in Fig. 5(a)) was positioned significantly more positive than that of H2O/O2 and slightly more negative than the VBMs of ZnxCd1−xSe, indicating that the photogenerated holes in the VBM of the semiconductor can drive the smooth one-electron oxidation of Ru2+ with a more positive potential than that of the oxygen evolution. The relatively negative onset potential for the ZnxCd1−xSe photoanode, especially for x = 0.25 and 0.5, and the positive equilibrium potential for the Ru complexes achieve a photovoltage higher than 1.23 V and nearly 70% of the bandgap energy is converted into photovoltage in the present PECV cells. In contrast, the CBM of CdSe is extremely positive, quite close to the equilibrium potential of H2/H+, which should cause the reduced onset potential of the CdSe photoanode and the lower VOC of the corresponding PECV cell compared to the other cases of ZnxCd1−xSe, as already described. However, despite the quite negative CBM of ZnSe and Zn0.75Cd0.25Se, the onset potentials for the ZnSe and Zn0.75Cd0.25Se photoanodes were 0.18 and −0.10 V vs. Fc/Fc+, respectively, and the VOCs for the corresponding PECVs were 0.71 and 1.0 V, equivalent to only 28 and 45% of the bandgap energy of each alloy, respectively. Indeed, even in the case of x = 0.25 and 0.5, there is still a relatively large gap between the CBM and the onset potential for the photoanode, i.e., more than 0.3 V. Thus, this suggests that there is a necessity of improving the onset potential, as well as the photocurrent, of the photoanodes by multilayer structuring and/or deposition of co-catalysts to obtain much higher photovoltages in the PECVs in a future study. Nevertheless, the present concept of the PECV cells consisting of particulate ZnxCd1−xSe photoanodes in a nonaqueous electrolyte containing Ru complexes with a positive equilibrium potential proposes a new approach to convert a large portion of the bandgap energy into a photovoltage exceeding the thermodynamic onset voltage for water splitting, with stably using semiconductor materials incapable of directly splitting water due to photocorrosion.

Conclusions
In the present study, PECV cells generating photovoltages higher than the thermodynamic onset voltage for water splitting (1.23 V), as well as converting more than 70% of the bandgap energy into photovoltage, with a one-step bandgap photoexcitation can be constructed using particulate ZnxCd1−xSe photoanodes in a nonaqueous electrolyte containing the [Ru(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox pair. The ZnxCd1−xSe particles synthesized via a solid-state reaction formed an almost single-phase solid solution with the wurtzite structure (x = 0 and 0.25) or zincblende structure (x = 0.5–1). The absorption edge of the alloy ranges from 480–750 nm in the visible light region according to the Zn/Cd ratio.
The photoanodes in an aqueous electrolyte containing a sacrificial reagent and in the nonaqueous electrolyte showed similar photovoltages due to the thermodynamically and/or kinetically easy reaction, that is, decomposition of the sacrificial reagent or oxidation of [Ru(bpy)3]2+, although the photocurrent in the nonaqueous electrolyte is lower due to light shielding by the Ru complexes. In contrast, the photoanodes in an aqueous electrolyte without the sacrificial reagent showed a significantly reduced photocurrent, positively shifted onset potential, and immediate deterioration of the photocurrent due to photocorrosion rather than water oxidation. Considering the Gibbs free energies for transforming Cd2+ and Zn2+ from water into acetonitrile, these cations should be more unstable in acetonitrile than in water, resulting in the improved durability of the photoanodes in the nonaqueous electrolyte. It was revealed that the redox equilibrium potential for [Ru(bpy)3]2+/3+ was positioned significantly more positive than for H2O/O2 and slightly more negative than for the VBMs of ZnxCd1−xSe, which enables the PECV cells to drive a smooth one-electron oxidation of Ru2+ by the photogenerated holes and convert more than 70% of the bandgap energy into photovoltage. However, there is still a significant gap between the CBM and the onset potential for the photoanode, implying the necessity of improving the onset potential, as well as the photocurrent, of the photoanodes in a future study. Nevertheless, the present study certainly demonstrates a novel alternative approach of PECV cells to obtain the target output voltage (i.e. >1.23 V), rather than simply maximizing the electric power, accompanied by converting a large portion of the bandgap energy into photovoltage using semiconductor materials incapable of directly splitting water.
