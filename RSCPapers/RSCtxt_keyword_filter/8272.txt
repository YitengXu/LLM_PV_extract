    , Accepted 1st December 2017First published on 4th December 2017AbstractAmong the recent investigations on transparent electrode materials applied in photoelectric devices, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) has been widely used because of its high transparency and low material cost. However, its relatively low conductivity, hygroscopicity, and acidity limit its further application. Herein, a novel PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs composite has been prepared via the in situ oxidative polymerization of EDOT using PSS and 4-mercaptobenzenesulfonic acid-modified silver nanowires (S-AgNWs), in which there are electrostatic interactions between PEDOT and sulfonic groups from PSS and S-AgNWs. When compared with commercial Clevios PH1000, a more crystalline and conductive PEDOT with quinoid conformation was developed by partially substituting PSS with the S-AgNWs; this resulted in the formation of PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs showing a lower sheet resistance (64 Ω sq−1 at ∼94.8% transmittance). Furthermore, due to reduced work function, hygroscopicity, and acidic properties of PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs derived from the in situ composite between S-AgNWs and PEDOT, as well as the reduction in the PSS content, PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs was used as a transparent electrode for the formation of organic solar cells (OSCs), displaying a power conversion efficiency of 10.2% and good storage stability.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted extensive attention as the most promising source of green energy for the next generation due to their advantages such as low-cost manufacture, lightweight, mechanical flexibility, and potential for large-scale production. Conductive polymers are most commonly used in transparent electrodes in OSCs.1–6 Moreover, one of the most crucial conductive polymers is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), which comprises a negatively charged polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) template and positively charged poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (EDOT) at a mass ratio of 2.5:1.7 Recently, the use of novel effective materials to in situ polymerize 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and form a well-dispersed colloid has been proposed. Li et al. have applied methylnaphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensate (MNSF) as a dispersant and dopant instead of linear PSS to prepare PEDOT:MNSF as a hole extraction material, which displays a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.1% in CH3NH3PbIxCl3−x-based inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs).8 Wu et al. have fabricated a PSC device with a PCE of 14.94%, which is higher than 12.6% achieved by PEDOT:PSS in inverted PSCs, by employing grafted sulfonated-acetone–formaldehyde lignin as the hole extract layer.9 Generally, a long and linear template with negative sulfonate can promote the formation of more conductive PEDOT chains with a quinoid structure through neutralizing the positive charge of PEDOT.
Despite its relatively high transparency in the doped state, water printability, low cost, and good mechanical flexibility, PEDOT:PSS shows some drawbacks such as relatively low conductivity, hygroscopicity, and acidity. Therefore, several solvent treatment approaches have been employed to improve the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS to increase the crystallinity of PEDOT and remove the insulating PSS.10–15 Moreover, PEDOT:PSS is usually combined with carbon materials or metal nanomaterials to improve the conductivity of the composite.16–24 In particular, silver nanowires (AgNWs) have drawn significant attention due to the extremely good conductivity/transmittance relationships.25,26 Moreover, they provide the advantage of being conveniently formed as high-quality films through a straightforward and large-scale solution fabrication process such as spin-coating, drop-coating, and air spraying-coating. For instance, Chen et al. have prepared a AgNW/PEDOT:PSS composite by physical blending a conductive electrode for use in organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs), which displayed a low sheet resistance (<140 Ω sq−1) versus transmittance (∼70%) in the visible region.27 Liu et al. have fabricated an ultra-smooth and transparent PEDOT:PSS/AgNW composite for use in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The transmittance was ∼95% in the spectral range between 400 and 800 nm, and the sheet resistance was 195 Ω sq−1.28 From the abovementioned examples, we can conclude that the performance of a physically blended PEDOT:PSS/AgNW composite is limited. On the other hand, an in situ polymerized composite can effectively improve the interactions between two phases and achieve a synergistic effect.
As is well-known, there are no interactions between PEDOT and AgNWs; thus, we have introduced 4-mercaptobenzenesulfonic acid (MBA) as an intermediary for the bonding interaction of sulfydryl with the AgNWs and the electrostatic interactions between the sulfonate and PEDOT. In this study, we present a novel in situ composite approach to polymerize EDOT by employing MBA-modified AgNWs (S-AgNWs) as a dopant and alternative to segmental PSS that can drastically improve the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs as compared to Clevios PH1000. The PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs has a relatively low sheet resistance (64 Ω sq−1 at ∼94.8% transmittance) and work function (4.78 eV), as well as reduced hygroscopicity and acidity, which can be suitably applied as an electrode in OSCs, displaying an excellent PCE of 10.2% and storage stability.
Experimental
Materials
4-Mercaptobenzenesulfonic acid (MBA, Carbott PharmTech Inc.), polystyrene sulfonate (PSS, Aldrich, Mw = ∼70000 g mol−1), 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT, Aldrich), ammonium persulfate (APS, Aladdin), silver nanowires (AgNWs, XFNANO), dimethylformamide (DMF, Aldrich), poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] and 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (PBDB-T and ITIC, 1-material, Chemscitech Inc., QC, Canada), chlorobenzene (CB, Aldrich), and 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO, Aldrich) were used as received without any further purification. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios PH1000, Heraeus Ltd, mass ratio = 1:2.5) was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter. Zinc oxide (ZnO) was synthesized according to a literature procedure.29

In situ polymerization of EDOT with PSS:S-AgNWs
MBA with different mass fractions (10%, 20%, and 30%) was first added to an aqueous solution of AgNWs and stirred for 12 h at room temperature. After dialysis for 2 days, the modified S-AgNWs were obtained. Then, the EDOT monomer was added to the suspension of the PSS:S-AgNWs. The mass ratio of PEDOT, PSS, and S-AgNWs was 1:1:0.01. After stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h at room temperature, the APS initiator (mass ratio of EDOT/APS = 1:1.3) dissolved in water was slowly added to the suspension. The resulting product was obtained after over 48 h of vigorous stirring and dialysis for 2 days. For comparison, in situ polymerized PEDOT:PSS (mass ratio = 1:1) was also been used to physically blend with the S-AgNWs. The corresponding sample was named PEDOT:PSS/S-AgNWs with the same mass ratio of 1:1:0.01.
Fabrication of organic solar cells using the PEDOT-based electrodes
The OSC device structure consisted of PEDOT-based electrodes (Clevios PH1000, PEDOT:PSS/S-AgNWs or PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs)/ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC/MoO3/Ag. At first, the pre-cleaned glass substrates were treated with O2 plasma. Then, a suspension of the PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs composite was spin-coated onto the cleaned glass substrate at 1200 rpm for 60 s and thermally annealed at 120 °C for 15 min. The obtained transparent electrode (thickness of ∼108 nm) was then transferred into a glovebox to spin-coat the PBDB-T:ITIC (1:1 wt%, 20 mg mL−1) in CB:DIO (100:0.5 vol%) solvent at 2500 rpm for 60 s and annealed at 160 °C for 10 min to form a ∼100 nm active layer. Eventually, MoO3 (7 nm) and Ag (90 nm) layers were deposited using vacuum evaporation at 3 × 10−4 Torr.
Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) images were obtained using an X-ray diffractometer (PERSEE, XD-3) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) operating at 40 kV and 30 mA. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a Perkin Elmer TGA at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 100 to 750 °C under a N2 atmosphere. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images and conducting-atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) images were obtained using an atomic force microscope (Bruker Multimode 8). The sheet resistances were tested using a four point probe set-up with a source measurement unit (Keithley 2400) and calculated using the equation: Rs = πV/(Iln2) = 4.53V/I. UV-vis spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer Lambda 750) was used to analyze the transmittance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed via a Thermo-VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 photoelectron spectrometer using a monochromated Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source. Raman spectroscopy was performed using an XploRA Raman microscope system (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Inc.) with laser excitation at 532 nm and 80 mW power. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained by a transmission electron microscope (JEOL, JEM-2100F) with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) equipment. Energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) was conducted using an FEI XL30 Sirion SEM. The samples were sputtered with ∼5 nm gold to prevent electron charging. Ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed using an AXISULTRA DLD spectrometer (Kratos Analytical Ltd) with a He I (21.22 eV) discharge lamp. The contact angle was determined using a DSA100 system (KRüSS). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were characterized using a Keithley model 2400 source meter (Abet Solar Simulator Sun2000) equipped with a light source (100 mW cm−2) and the AM 1.5 G filter. The incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was determined under monochromatic illumination (Oriel Cornerstone 260 1/4 m monochromator with an Oriel 70613NS QTH lamp), and a standard silicon cell was utilized to calibrate the incident light.
Results and discussion
The PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs suspensions were successfully obtained via the in situ oxidative polymerization of EDOT in an aqueous solution of S-AgNWs and PSS. As is well-known, solution polymerization has been recognized as the most straightforward strategy to polymerize EDOT, and template-based method is a highly effective technique to obtain expanding quinoid PEDOT with high conductivity. In this study, due to the existence of electrostatic interactions between PEDOT and sulfonic groups belonging to PSS and the S-AgNWs, as well as the partial substitution of insulating PSS by the conductive S-AgNWs, the PSS:S-AgNWs were used as a template for the polymerization of EDOT, which could endow higher conductivity as compared to the commercial Clevios PH1000. The key issue is how to control the mass ratio of the reactants to guarantee excellent dispersity and conductivity. We prepared PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs using two main steps. At first, the surface of the AgNWs was decorated with MBA, of which sulfydryl displayed a bonding interaction with the AgNWs. Afterwards, PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs were successfully obtained via the simultaneous chemical oxidation polymerization of EDOT with PSS and S-AgNWs acting as templates (Fig. 1a).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of (d and f) AgNWs and (e and g) S-AgNWs. The S-AgNWs were prepared by decorating 4-mercaptobenzenesulfonic acid (MBA) on AgNWs with a 20% mass fraction. The AgNWs were bonded with MBA via the sulfydryl group. PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs was obtained via the in situ polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) in an aqueous solution containing polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) and S-AgNWs with a PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs mass ratio of 1:1:0.01. There are charge interactions between the sulfonic acid groups (of PSS and S-AgNWs) and PEDOT. 
The modification degree of MBA on the AgNWs used as a template directly affected the degree of polymerization and electrical conductivity of PEDOT. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the S-AgNWs modified with different amounts of MBA are shown in Fig. S1a–c (ESI†). Discrete MBA-modified AgNWs are observed in the S-AgNWs prepared using a low mass fraction of MBA. However, the addition of excess MBA results in agglomeration due to the strong hydrogen-bond interactions between MBA. Generally, S-AgNWs used as a template for polymerizing EDOT need to be well-dispersed and endure less conductivity loss. Therefore, S-AgNWs modified with a 20% mass fraction of MBA were used for further polymerization process. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra (Fig. 1b) were obtained to characterize the modified S-AgNWs. Contrary to the XPS spectral signal for the pristine AgNWs, the emerged S 2s and S 2p peaks and an enhanced C 1s peak show the existence of the interactions between the AgNWs and MBA, and the role of MBA in bonding with the AgNWs rather than blending. Furthermore, the TEM images and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (Fig. 1d–g), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping from the corresponding SEM images (Fig. S1d and e, ESI†), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S2a, ESI†), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. S2b, ESI†) further verified that the AgNWs had been successfully chemically modified with MBA. The yellow color represents the characteristic radiation of the S element, indicating that MBA has well-bonded on the surface of the AgNWs. S-AgNWs (20%) as a template was used to further polymerize EDOT with the auxiliary assistance of PSS to form the conductive PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs composite. The XPS Ag 3d peaks of the AgNWs, S-AgNWs, and PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs were measured to investigate the combination mode between MBA, AgNWs, and PEDOT, as shown in Fig. 1c. The Ag 3d peak of S-AgNWs shifts towards a higher binding energy as compared to that of the pristine AgNWs; this is ascribed to the bonding effects between MBA and the AgNWs. Simultaneously, the absence of peak position differences for S-AgNWs and the PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs indicates the electrostatic attraction between the S-AgNWs and PEDOT, rather than chemical bonding interactions.
It has been found that there are obvious differences in the morphologies when different templates are used to polymerize EDOT, which have been characterized by TEM, as shown in Fig. 2. Compared to the relatively continuous morphology with some isolated PEDOT grains observed for Clevios PH1000, isolated S-AgNWs and many PEDOT clusters were observed in the PEDOT:PSS/S-AgNWs physical blend, which displayed an inferior dispersibility in an aqueous solution (Fig. S3a, ESI†). For the PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs, it can be found that PEDOT has polymerized along with the S-AgNWs with a large colloidal surface coverage. The tremendous enrichment of PEDOT chains can greatly improve the conductivity.30 Excitingly, PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs show good dispersibility (Fig. S3b, ESI†) due to MBA that serves as both electronegative sulfonate for PEDOT polymerization and water-soluble dispersant for the AgNWs. The morphological changes were further confirmed using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Contrary to the S peak intensity of Clevios PH1000, an apparently reduced S peak intensities observed in PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs and PEDOT:PSS/S-AgNWs were ascribed to the decreased PSS content. Moreover, a higher S peak intensity and lower Ag peak intensity was observed for the PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs as compared to the case of PEDOT:PSS/S-AgNWs; this was attributed to the enriched polymerized PEDOT coating on the PSS:S-AgNWs.

Clevios PH1000 is commercial PEDOT:PSS with a mass ratio of 1:2.5. PEDOT:PSS/S-AgNWs was obtained by the physical blending of polymerized PEDOT:PSS with S-AgNWs based on a mass ratio of 1:1:0.01. 
To further discuss the relationships between the chemical structures and morphologies of PEDOT polymerized using different templates, Raman spectra were obtained, as presented in Fig. 3a. The characteristic peak in the Raman spectra at 989 cm−1 was attributed to the C–O–C deformation vibration of PEDOT. The main peaks between 1400 and 1500 cm−1 correspond to the CαCβ stretching on the thiophene ring in PEDOT.31,32 More sharp and intense CαCβ peaks appear in the PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs as compared to the case of Clevios PH1000; this illustrates the enhancement in the crystallinity of the PEDOT polymer chains. It has been reported that there is a red shift in the CαCβ peak when the thiophene ring changes from a coiled benzoid to a linear quinoid structure,33 of which the adjacent thiophene rings in the PEDOT chains are nearly in an identical plane; this consequently enhances the ordered structure, decreases the charge migration energy, and delocalizes the conjugated π-electrons over the whole chain.34 As compared to the CαCβ peak (1437 cm−1) of Clevios PH1000, there was an obvious red-shift (∼2 cm−1) observed for the PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs, which illustrated that a more crystalline and conductive PEDOT with a quinoid-conformation was developed due to the partial substitution of the insulating PSS by the conductive linear S-AgNWs.35,36 Furthermore, this phenomenon proves that the negatively charged sulfonate on PSS:S-AgNWs interacts strongly with the positively charged PEDOT.37

The XPS spectra of Clevios PH1000, PEDOT:PSS/S-AgNWs, and PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs are shown in Fig. 3b. The XPS band between 166 and 172 eV belongs to the S 2p band of the sulfur atoms in PSS; however, the doublet peaks (S 2p2/1 and S 2p3/2) between 162 and 166 eV are associated to the sulfur atoms in PEDOT.38,39 For the PEDOT:PSS/S-AgNWs, the intensities of the S 2p2/1 and S 2p3/2 peaks are not obvious; this is attributed to the existence of a lower amount of PEDOT polymerized by the single PSS template. The intensities of the S 2p2/1 and S 2p3/2 peaks observed for PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs are significantly higher than that of the PEDOT:PSS/S-AgNWs; this is attributed to more PEDOT chains polymerized by the sulfonate template of the S-AgNWs. The increased content of PEDOT will enhance the electrical conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs composite, which has been further proved using atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 4. Compared to Clevios PH1000, which displays a more dark area ascribed to an excess of insulating PSS, as well as PEDOT:PSS/S-AgNWs, which shows partial agglomeration,40 there are more bright spots representing a conductive area with uniform distribution in the PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs although the roughness is not obviously changed. The PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs show a more homogeneous current with an optimal value of 0.34 nA, which is markedly higher than the corresponding values of Clevios PH1000 (0.26 nA) and PEDOT:PSS/S-AgNWs (0.02 nA), respectively. Therefore, due to the existence of strong electrostatic interactions between the abundant sulfonate groups on the S-AgNWs and PEDOT, the modified S-AgNWs can be used as a novel template for EDOT polymerization to partially substitute the insulating PSS, consequently leading to a great enhancement in the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs.

As a transparent electrode, PEDOT:PSS can be processed using DMF solvent treatment to improve the conductivity, which requires coordination with transmittance to achieve the best performance. To further investigate the relationship between conductivity and transparency, sheet resistance (Rs) using a four-point probe method and optical transmittance (T) using UV-vis spectroscopy were measured, as shown in Fig. 5. PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs obtain a high transmittance approaching 94.8% (at 550 nm) with a relatively low Rs value of ∼64 Ω sq−1, which is superior to the corresponding properties of Clevios PH1000 and PEDOT:PSS/S-AgNWs. As is well known, the T and Rs values of transparent electrodes are associated by the following formula.41–44  where σOp(λ) and σDC are the optical conductivity and direct current (DC) conductivity, respectively. Herein, the value of σDC/σOp can be defined as a figure of merit and a higher ratio indicates a more outstanding property. As expected, the PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs exhibit σDC/σOp ≈ 114.8, which is superior to that found for Clevios PH1000 (∼49.6) and PEDOT:PSS/S-AgNWs (∼40.5). From the above, PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs with the outstanding performance will have real potential in photoelectric devices.

(b) The corresponding photoelectric performance of the Clevios PH1000, PEDOT:PSS/S-AgNWs and PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs films treated with DMF. 
To determine the practicability of the PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs with aforementioned enhanced performance, its application in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs was investigated. OSCs were prepared with an inverted device structure of glass/PEDOT-based composite electrode/ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC/MoOx/Ag, as described in Fig. 6a. From the energy level diagram of the OSC (Fig. 6b), it is surprising to find that PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs display a lower work function (4.78 eV) than Clevios PH1000 (5.21 eV) and PEDOT:PSS/S-AgNWs (4.85 eV) obtained using ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. S4, ESI†); this is favorable for forming an ohmic contact with the ZnO layer. Moreover, the treated PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs (55°) were more hydrophobic than Clevios PH1000 (36°) and PEDOT:PSS/S-AgNWs (45°) for the replacement of a portion of hygroscopic PSS with S-AgNWs, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), which were beneficial to improve the OSC stability.45 The current density–voltage (J–V) performance of the OSCs was tested under one standard sun using an Air Mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. As shown in Fig. 6c and Table 1, the OSC device based on PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs yields a PCE of 10.2% with a short current density (Jsc) of 17.68 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.887 V, and fill factor (FF) of 65%, which are superior to the parameters observed for the OSC devices comprising Clevios PH1000 and the PEDOT:PSS/S-AgNWs. In Fig. 6d, the corresponding Jsc value of the OSC device based on the PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs calibrated the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra from 300 nm to 800 nm was 17.42 mA cm−2, which was in accordance with the result obtained from the J–V curve. The long-term stabilities of the inverted OSCs based on Clevios PH1000 and PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs electrodes were evaluated, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs-based device shows better stability, retaining 72.1% of its original PCE after 10 days in the glove box, which is in accordance with the pH value listed in Fig. S7 (ESI†). In addition, PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs with a higher pH value (2.65) were more stable and non-corrosive as compared to Clevios PH1000 (1.48) and PEDOT:PSS/S-AgNWs (2.02); this implied that a relatively environmentally stable hydrophobic electrode with low hygroscopicity and acidity was obtained. Moreover, the performance of the OSCs based on PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs was confirmed as a PCE of 9.2% with PTB7-Th:PC71BM was obtained, and the J–V curves, IPCE spectra, and concrete parameters are summarized in Fig. S8 and Table S1 (ESI†). In a word, the PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs electrode possesses good device performance and stability, which has been successfully demonstrated to have potential applications in organic solar cells.

Conclusions
A PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs composite has been successfully prepared via the in situ oxidative polymerization of EDOT in an aqueous solution with PSS and S-AgNWs dual-templates due to electrostatic interactions between PEDOT and the sulfonic groups in PSS and the S-AgNWs. The addition of S-AgNWs and a reduction in the amount of insulating PSS accelerates the PEDOT chains change from a benzoid to quinoid-conformation and results in PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs with a relatively low sheet resistance of 64 Ω sq−1 at ∼94.8% transmittance. Most prominently, the reduced work function (4.78 eV) and hydrophobic characteristics observed for PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs are beneficial to form an ohmic contact with the ZnO layer in an OSC device and improve the device stability. The PEDOT:PSS:S-AgNWs transparent electrode-based device displays a power conversion efficiency of 10.2% and good storage stability.
