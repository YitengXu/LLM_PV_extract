    , Accepted 13th August 2019First published on 16th August 2019AbstractHighly fluorescent N-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) and graphitic carbon nitride quantum dots (CNQDs, g-C3N4) were synthesized using a solid-phase microwave-assisted (SPMA) technique. The SPMA method, based on the pyrolysis of citric acid and urea with different recipes, is capable of producing quantum dots with coexisting NGQDs and CNQDs at 280 °C within only five minutes. The photoluminescence (PL) emissions from NGQD and CNQDs are strongly dependent on the excitation wavelength and the solvent type, i.e., water, ethanol, and N-methyl pyrrolidinone. The unique attribute of the quantum dots, possessing a multiple chromophoric band-gap structure, originates from the presence of g-C3N4, defect-related emissive traps, and grain boundaries. Thus, an appropriate excitation wavelength induces a conjugated π electron system to fulfill the most probable absorption band, resulting in wavelength-dependent emissions including ultraviolet, visible and infrared light. The quantum yield of the NGQD and CNQD samples can reach as high as 68.1%. Accordingly, a light-emitting device using the combination of the NGQD and CNQD powder embedded polymeric film can emit white-like light with ultra-high power-conversion efficiency.
Introduction
Graphene quantum dots (GQDs), zero-dimensional materials with combined attributes of the graphene and carbon dots, demonstrate superior electrochemical and photoelectrochemical properties. GQDs are indeed ultra-small pieces of graphene (particle sizes range from 3 to 20 nm) consisting of no more than 5 layers of graphene layers (approximately 2.5 nm).1 Having tunable semiconducting characteristics, GQDs are employed in a vast variety of applications including optical detection probes,2 bio-imaging probes,3,4 electrochemical capacitors,5–7 solar cells,8,9 Li-ion batteries,10,11 visible-light-derived photocatalysts12,13 and many others. Compared to metal–oxide quantum dots, GQDs have attracted significant attention thanks to their excellent biocompatibility, non-toxicity, facile modification capability, robust chemical inertness, high aqueous solubility, and environmental friendliness.14
Various techniques have been developed for synthesizing GQDs. These techniques are commonly categorized as top-down or bottom-up methods.1 Cutting down micro-sized carbon-based structures (e.g. graphene sheets, carbon nanotubes, carbon fibers, and graphite) into GQDs is the principle of the top-down technique. In the bottom-up method, small molecules serve as the starting materials/seeds for synthesizing the GQDs. Among these techniques, the pyrolysis of carbon has emerged as a promising method due to its low cost, simplicity, and high efficiency for large scale production of GQDs.15,16 However, the pyrolysis technique still faces several challenges that must be tackled before widespread adoption. The GQDs synthesized using the pyrolysis method often have an undefined chemical composition with a relatively low quantum yield (typically 10–20%).
To address these issues, in this work, we have developed an efficient solid-phase microwave-assisted (SPMA) technique for synthesizing N-doped GQDs (NGQDs) and graphitic-C3N4 quantum dots (CNQDs) with a precisely controlled composition. The one-pot SPMA technique can produce various configurations of the quantum dots if the chemical composition of the precursors is finely tailored. Several prior studies have focused on synthesizing graphitic carbon nitride using the microwave mediated method utilizing formamide17 and C–N–H precursors at high temperature.18,19 However, very limited efforts have been dedicated for synthesizing NGQDs and CNQDs capable of boosting the photoluminescence (PL) intensity. Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap strongly depends on the particle size of the GQDs.20 Along with the size effect, theoretical predictions have also shown that in-plane substitution of nitrogen heteroatoms can modulate graphene sheets to n-type semiconductors.21
Recently, several efforts have been devoted to synthesizing NGQDs via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with pyridine as the sole source of C and N,21 the microwave-assisted solvothermal method,22 the hydrothermal route using NH4OH as the nitrogen source,23 pyrolysis of the citric acid–ethanolamine precursor,24 and pyrolysis of core–shell nanoparticles followed by dialysis.25
Prior studies have introduced several synthesis routes for NGQDs; however, the preparation of the NGQDs with a high amidation-level has not been demonstrated in these studies (i.e. the N/C ratio has only been reported to be in the range of 7 to 30 at%). In this work, we have explored the influence of N-doping concentration (i.e. the N/C ratio: 34–66 at%) on the PL response and quantum yield of GQD suspensions. The SPMA method enables a straightforward route for synthesizing the NGQD and CNQD samples.26,27 The experimental results show that the distinctive properties of the two samples can be realized by tuning the optical band gap via altering the integrity of the π system and adjusting the amidation level of NGQDs and CNQDs. The effect of solvents on the PL behavior has also been investigated by dispersing the samples in distilled water, ethanol, and N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP). In addition, the key parameters along with the band-gap structure for tailoring color emissions and quantum yields from NGQDs and CNGQs have been discussed.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 includes XRD patterns of the NGQD and CNQD samples; a distinct peak at about 26–29° is recognizable within the spectra. According to Fig. 1, the NCD-1 sample possesses a twin-peak at 27.5 and 28.1°, whereas only one lump appears at approximately 27.3–27.5° for both NCD-2 and NCD-3 samples. The dominant peaks at 27.5° (d002 = 0.324 nm) and 28.1° (d002 = 0.317 nm) are indexed to the (002) planes of graphite-like and graphitic-C3N4 crystals, which are commonly attributed to the interlayer stacking reflections.28 This result reveals that the NCD-1 sample consists of the sp2-layered and graphitic-C3N4 crystals. In contrast, both NCD-2 and NCD-3 samples have sp2-layered stacking crystals with an average d002 = 0.324–0.327 nm based on the predictions provided by Bragg's Law. This structural change mainly originates from the pyrolysis of citric acid and urea precursors at different C/N chemical ratios. Usually, during the synthesis process using the SPMA technique, the pyrolysis of the C-rich precursor is prone to forming a graphene-like crystalline structure, whereas the pyrolysis under N-rich conditions tends to generate a mixture of graphene-based and g-C3N4 crystals.
 Fig. 1  Typical XRD patterns of different samples. The analysis shows that the NCD-1 sample shows a twin peak consisting of coexistence of g-C3N4 and N-doped GQDs, while one broad lump appears at 27.0° for both NCD-2 and NCD-3 samples. 
To further explore this trend, the ICP-OES/MS and XPS measurements were employed to uncover the chemical compositions induced by C- and N-rich precursors. The N/C atomic ratios of NCD-1, NCD-2, and NCD-3 samples are 66, 48, and 34 at%, respectively (based on the analysis provided by the ICP-OES/MS). Since the NCD-1 sample contains a mixture of N-doped graphene and g-C3N4 crystals, the N/C atomic ratio cannot be used to indicate the exact C:N ratio in g-C3N4 crystals. It can be deduced that the N/C ratio decreases with increased carbon source concentration (i.e., citric acid) within the precursor. As shown in Fig. 2(a), survey XPS spectra confirm the presence of three main elements: C 1s (ca. 284 eV), N 1s (ca. 400 eV) and O 1s (ca. 532 eV).21,23 Herein the N/C atomic ratio has been modulated as NCD-1 (174 at%), NCD-2 (46 at%), and NCD-3 (39%) based on the XPS analysis. It is important to note that the chemical compositions of the NCD-2 and NCD-3 samples analyzed by XPS were identical to the ones characterized by ICP-OES/MS. However, the NCD-1 sample possesses an ultrahigh level (174 at%) of N-rich chemical species on its surface. It is well established that the ICP-OES/MS analysis offers information on the elementary composition of the bulk materials; however, XPS provides more sophisticated characterization regarding the surface chemical composition (usually 10 nm in the depth of particle). Therefore, it can be inferred that the NCD-1 sample is composed of coexisting crystals, resulting from N-doped graphene oxide (CxNyOz) and formation of g-C3N4. Also, both NCD-2 and NCD-3 samples were found to consist of N-doped graphene oxide structures, confirming the characterization provided by XRD.
 Fig. 2  (a) Survey-scan XPS spectra of different samples and the N 1s peak deconvoluted by a multiple Gaussian function: (b) NCD-1, (c) NCD-2, and (d) NCD-3 samples. 
As shown in the ESI (see Fig. S1†), the C 1s spectra were decomposed into five peaks at 284.4 eV (CC or C–C), 285.2 eV (C–N), 287.5 eV (C–OH), 288.5 (CO) and 289.5 eV (O–CO), indicating different bonding types to C atoms. Also, the analysis reveals that the NCD-1 sample displays a large amount of C–N groups compared to other samples. This finding also implies that the pyrolysis of the N-rich precursor facilitates the growth of the C–N group or g-C3N4 crystals. The N 1s high-resolution XPS spectra in Fig. 2(b)–(d) can be deconvoluted into signals for predominant pyrrolic or pyridinic N (ca. 399.6 eV), quaternary N (ca. 400.4 eV), and N-oxides (e.g., OC–N) at ca. 401.5 eV.23,29 Herein the first component usually refers to the presence of aromatic CN–C, in which nitrogen bonds to two carbon atoms or the pyridine moiety. The second one in the region is commonly assigned to tertiary N-(C)3 that quaternary N is bonded to three sp2 carbon atoms, (known as graphitic nitrogen).28,30,31 The last one is amino group C–N–H, originating from the amide-carbonyl group (OC–NH2), e.g., amino and amide carbonyl functional groups located at the edges of graphene sheets.32,33 According to Fig. 2(b), the areal ratio of aromatic CN–C to tertiary N-(C)3 is approximately 1.4, confirming the presence of g-C3N4 in the NCD-1 sample.17 This finding is in good agreement with the XRD analysis. However, it is believed that the NCD-1 sample contains not only g-C3N4 but also other functionalities (such carboxylic, carbonyl, and phenolic groups), thus inducing the sp2 hybridization of C atoms. Accordingly, an increased amidation level due to the formation of g-C3N4 crystals increases the sp2-hybridization level and such an influence is more evident within the quantum dot composition.

Fig. 3(a)–(c) show HR-TEM micrographs of each sample, confirming an enhanced uniformity for quantum dots. The corresponding diagrams of particle size distribution for all samples are illustrated in Fig. 3(d)–(f). As shown in Fig. 3, the NCD-1 sample displays the narrowest distribution and smallest average particle size among all the samples. The average particle sizes are ca. 2.8, 4.1, and 4.2 nm for NCD-1, NCD-2, and NCD-3 samples, respectively. It is important to note that the recipe of the carbon precursor hugely influences the particle size as well as the lattice fringe, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3(a)–(c). The pattern structure demonstrates superb crystallinity with a lattice distance of 0.22 nm for all the samples (corresponding to the (1120) lattice fringe of graphene-based materials).34 Herein the dashed white curves were used to outline the edges for each particle. According to Fig. 3, the majority of the particles possess circular (NCD-1) and elliptical (NCD-2 and NCD-3) shapes. The formation of the circular peripheries is due to the thermodynamically favoured natural tendency for minimizing the edge free energies (for the equilibrium state) through atomic migration of uncombined/rearranged atoms (e.g., C, N, O in this case) and reconstruction of crystallization.35,36 The formation of g-C3N4 crystals (NCD-1 sample) was also confirmed by the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The MD simulations revealed that the thermal equilibration of the atomic configuration is stable at approximately 227 °C. This indicates that the O-doped g-C3N4 flake is likely to be formed with a high N/C ratio.26

Fig. 4(a)–(c) demonstrate UV-vis absorbance spectra of different quantum dots in distilled water, ethanol, and NMP. The UV-vis spectra display three main absorption bands in the water and ethanol solvents within the entire wavelength range from 300 to 500 nm. In contrast, the quantum dots in the NMP solvent are found to follow a different trend due to an intrinsic specific absorbance band at wavelength below 300 nm. The absorption bands of the quantum dot samples at ca. 240–250 nm, 320–350 nm, and 400–420 nm can be ascribed to the presence of π → π* transition of CC of the sp2 domain in the sp3 C matrix, n → π* transition of CO or typical absorption pattern of carbon nitride (335 nm), and surface molecular center or an absorption edge induced by the (n → π*) transitions of nonbonding electrons of adatoms.37–42 It is well established that the absorption band can be inferred from the transition from the HOMO to LUMO of functional groups (e.g., CO, C–N, and CN).3 Therefore, the localization of functional groups imparts the change of the edge of band gap structures. Theoretically, the band gap of aromatic molecules tends to decrease from 7 eV (single benzene ring) to 2 eV (a cluster of 20 aromatic rings).43 This observation implies that not only the quantum size but also the surface heterogeneity (e.g., localized defect, adatom decoration, chemical bonding) affects the band gap configuration of quantum dots and subsequently alters the optical and electrical properties. To further elucidate such a change in the band-gap, typical Tauc plots of each sample (data from the UV-vis spectra) are plotted in Fig. S2.† The extrapolation of each straight line (the interception with the x-axis) determines the indirect optical energy gap.44,45 There are at least three distinct slopes in the Tauc plots, indicating the presence of multiple band-gap structures on the quantum dots. As for the quantum dots in water, the ranges of the indirect band gap are estimated to be 1.6–5.0 eV (NCD-1), 1.7–4.7 eV (NCD-2), and 1.8–4.1 eV (NCD-3). The transformation of the edge state and the resulting multiple absorption bands within the quantum dot configuration is primarily due to: (i) formation of g-C3N4 (with a band gap of 2.7 eV), (ii) conjugation of pyrrolic/pyridinic N groups, (iii) electrical conduction of the quaternary N group, and (iv) absorption edge of heterogeneous atoms.

The Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots of GQD electrodes have been also assessed to investigate the band structure of the GQD samples The M–S plots are shown in Fig. S3,† in which the slopes of the linear parts of all M–S plots are positive, indicating a typical n-type semiconductor characteristic.46–48 Of note, there are more than one distinct slopes in the M–S plots, revealing the presence of multiple band-gap structures on GQD samples. The carrier densities (ND) of NCD-1 and NCD-3 electrodes are 1.96 × 1022 and 4.51 × 1022 cm−3, respectively, determined from the slopes of the M–S plots. The larger ND value of the GQD electrodes implies enhanced charge transfer efficiency. The linear portions of the M–S plots are extrapolated to 1/CS → 0 for obtaining the EFL values of NCD-1 and NCD-3 electrodes (i.e. ca. 0.84 and 1.12 V (vs. NHE) for the NCD-1 and NCD-3 samples, respectively). The pronounced positive shift of EFL suggests that surface heterogeneity, due to high amidation and oxidation levels, leads to a decreased band bending edge. Here CS is the space charge capacitance in the semiconductor and EFL is the potential corresponding to the flat band potential. Therefore, the width of the space charge layer, WSC, can be estimated based on this analysis.49 For the similar values of EFL, a shorter space charge layer indicates a higher degree of band bending near the GQD surface, leading to more effective collection of charge carriers.50 The WSC values were determined to be 4.86 nm and 3.80 nm for NCD-1 and NCD-3 electrodes, respectively. The calculated WSC values are similar to the average particle size of quantum dots, verifying the feasibility of the proposed band structure, as demonstrated in Fig. S4.†
The optical images of different quantum dots in distilled water, ethanol, and NMP solvent under sunlight, UV (365 nm), and blue light (450 nm) are shown in Fig. 5. The analysis reveals that all the samples in water and ethanol are transparent under sunlight but the color becomes translucent when the particles are dispersed in NMP. Under the UV light, the quantum dots are capable of illuminating yellow-green (NCD-1), green (NCD-2), and deep blue (NCD-3) in water and ethanol, whereas all samples tend to become pale colors in NMP. It is interesting to mention that all the samples are excited to glitter under blue-light illumination. The bright yellow, yellow, and aqua blue lights are emitted from NCD-1, NCD-2, and NCD-3 samples in ethanol, respectively. These observations reflect the fact that the quantum dots are sensitive to the type of the solvents, i.e., a red shift from water to ethanol. The influence of solvents on the fluorescence performance of quantum dots can be attributed to their dispersion level and surface state of the sp2 cluster in different solvents.51 The solvents used in this case are NMP (pH = 8.5 and relative polarity: 0.66), ethanol (pH = 7.1 and relative polarity: 0.56), and distilled water (pH = 5.8 and relative polarity: 1.00). Since a large number of functional groups (e.g., negatively charged carboxylic group) are attached to the edge of quantum dots, the functional groups serve as the electron donors during the PL procedure.52 The hydrophilic edges as well as planes on the functionalized quantum dots facilitate the surface adsorption of polar molecules. Accordingly, the solvent-dependent behavior is mainly associated with the emissive traps on the surface of quantum dots induced by solvent attachment.53

The fluorescence spectrum of the synthesized quantum dots conformed to the UV-vis absorption characteristics. Fig. 6 depicts PL emission spectra of different quantum dots in distilled water and ethanol under excitation with wavelengths ranging from 320 to 480 nm. As shown in Fig. 6, the NCD-1 sample displays an asymmetric lump including several peaks under 320–380 nm and then a symmetric-like peak associated with a slight tailing under 410–480 nm. The PL response also shows a single typical band at ca. 450 nm under 340 and 360 nm, ascribed to the presence of g-C3N4 in the NCD-1 sample.22 For the NCD-3 sample, a distinct peak within the entire wavelength (320–480 nm) can be observed. Among all the samples, the fluorescence response of the NCD-2 sample can be considered a transition between NCD-1 and NCD-3. The wavelength-dependent PL response (i.e., red shift) in water is similar to that in ethanol owing to the thermal loss and/or the formation of an excited-state relaxation channel.54 The PL emission spectra for all the samples in the NMP solvent for the wavelength ranging from 320 to 480 nm are given in Fig. S5† (the spectra are almost identical to those in water and ethanol). It is worth noting that a vivid and recognizable PL response occurs at 620–700 nm when all the samples are illuminated under UV light (320 and 340 nm). Indeed, the red-light emission is also considered for the excitation in water and ethanol; however, the relative intensity is minor compared to that for the other visible lights, as shown in Fig. 6. This finding is beneficial for the development of red-light sources for applications related to the light emitting diodes and fluorescence imaging in vivo. The photostability of bare NCD-1, NCD-2, and NCD-3 samples without embedding in polymeric films was evaluated after storing all samples for 6 months. The PL spectra of all samples under 450 nm before and after 6 months were collected, as shown in Fig. S6.† We observed that the deviations of PL intensity for all samples are less than 6.9%, confirming excellent photostability of GQD samples.
 Fig. 6  PL emission spectra of different samples in distilled water: (a) NCD-1, (b) NCD-2, and (c) NCD-3 and in ethanol: (d) NCD-1, (e) NCD-2, and (f) NCD-3 samples. 
The Φ values for the samples determined using eqn (1) were 23.4% (NCD-1), 21.8% (NCD-2), and 20.5% (NCD-3) in distilled water. For the NMP solvent, the Φ values dramatically drop (NCD-1 (11.6%) ≈ NCD-2 (11.1%) ≈ NCD-3 (11.2%)). The maximal Φ values of the samples in ethanol are significantly higher (NCD-1 (68.1%), NCD-2 (66.1%) and NCD-3 (54.7%)). A significantly increased Φ value can be considered as a crucial index to assess the ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of photons adsorbed during the radiation-induced process.55 This finding confirms that the quantum dots are very efficient in emitting photons within ethanol, compared to that in water and NMP. The Φ value of the NCD-1 sample is vastly higher compared to that of the GQDs reported elsewhere (i.e., from 2 to 22.9%56,57). The enhanced Φ value can be attributed to the chemical nature of the NCD-1 sample since it contains a large number of C–N/CN bond structures, instead of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups that commonly act as a non-radiative electron–hole recombination center.4,58 Thus, the design of quantum dots incorporated with NGQDs and CNQDs results in a more efficient PL emission.
As shown in Fig. 6, a multiple fluorescence intensity level of individual quantum dots can be identified. The single NCD-1 sample at different excitation energies reveals significant heterogeneity in lower energy trap sites between each particle.14 This observation suggests that the NCD-1 sample is composed of a multiple chromophoric band-gap structure, which originated from g-C3N4, oxygenated/nitrogenated defect-related emissive traps, and grain boundaries. To figure out the deduction, one facile tapping-density method was adopted to approximately estimate the fraction of g-C3N4 in the samples. The mass fractions of g-C3N4 are determined to be 80.4 ± 4.5%, 38.3 ± 5.2%, and 7.2 ± 3.6% in NCD-1, NCD-2, and NCD-3 samples, respectively. The optical band-gap structure of the NCD-1 sample (mainly g-C3N4) under UV and blue light illumination is proposed, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Under 320 nm UV light, the absorption of UV photons by the localized π electron in double bonds (mainly CC or CN) produces an electron–hole pair (exciton) upon electron transition (V3 → C3). The exciton may emit UV light (path (i): C3 → V3) through radiative recombination after vibration relaxation. The excited electron possibly undergoes inter-band transition from a higher conduction band to a lower conduction band (e.g., C3 → C2 or C3 → C1), subsequently emitting visible light (path (ii): C2 → V2 or path (iii): C1 → V1) by radiative recombination.59 This mechanism addresses the underlying reason for the emission of the UV and visible spectra by the NCD-1 quantum dots upon UV absorption (details are shown in Fig. 6(a) and (d)). Under 450 nm visible light, conjugated π electrons in NCD-1 quantum dots (V2 → C2) are capable of imparting the excitons followed by emitting visible light (path (I′): light illumination, partial C2 → V2 and path (ii′): C1 → V1) upon the vibration relaxation. Such an excitation emits the photons with wavelengths (ca. 530 nm) longer than the absorbed wavelengths (450 nm), as depicted in Fig. 7(b). For comparison, the schematic diagram describing the multiple band-gap structure of the NCD-3 sample is illustrated in Fig. S7.† Since the NCD-3 sample is mainly an N-doped graphene structure, the photon pathway from a high energy adsorbing site to a low energy emissive site becomes simpler compared to the NCD-1 sample. This observation is well supported by the PL emission spectra illustrated in Fig. 6(c) and (f) exhibiting a single major PL response. Accordingly, it can be inferred that an appropriate excitation wavelength is essential for a conjugated π electron system to induce a desirable absorption and subsequently to initiate an excitation wavelength-dependent emission.

To sum up, the NCD-1 sample can serve as an emitter for a whole wavelength light source, while the NCD-3 sample is prone to emit monochrome light under an appropriate light illumination. The narrow-wavelength PL emission from the NCD-3 sample fulfils the requirements of optical devices through a well-controlled synthesis processing. To assess the functionality for practical applications, one light-emitting-diode (LED) device utilizing the NCD-1 sample was built. Herein free-standing luminescent films of the NCD-1 embedded silica gel matrix were fabricated as shown in Fig. 8(a). The silica gel not only provides a mechanical support but also immobilizes the NCD-1 sample to avoid the formation of an aggregate of quantum dots and solid-state fluorescence quenching. The LED device is capable of emitting white-like light. In the fluorescence spectrum, there is a strong emission within the entire wavelength ranging from 430 to 675 nm, in which two peaks located at 460 and 550 nm (see Fig. 8(b)) are recognizable. The corresponding Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinate is (0.35, 0.36), and the color-rendering index is shown in the inset of Fig. 8(b). As shown by the CIE 1931 color space, the LED device equipped with NCD-1 is capable of emitting white-like light, thus, suggesting a pathway for commercial applications.

To probe the device stability and durability, the reliability test of the white LED using NCD-1 quantum dots was carried out at 85 °C with a relative humidity of 80% for 240 h. Fig. S8(a)–S8(c)† show the luminous efficiency, color rendering index (CRI), and quantum yield of the LED using NCD-1 quantum dots at various operating currents. These parameters provide crucial indices for evaluating the stability of LED devices. It can be seen that the emission intensity, CRI, and quantum yield are stable within the entire current range, i.e., no obvious shift can be observed with increased current. As illustrated in Fig. S8,† with further increasing the current, the CIE chromaticity coordinates remain almost unchanged (see Fig. S8(d)†). This observation reflects the fact that the CIE color coordinate is within the range of warm white light, which is extremely close to the CIE coordinate (0.33, 0.33) of highly pure white light.60 This finding confirms the robustness of the in-house LED device designed and fabricated using home-made NCD-1 quantum dots. We also investigated the time stability of the device. The prepared device was kept in a drying cabinet environment for 3 months, and the luminous lux attenuation was less than 20%, which further confirms the superior stability of the device demonstrated in this work (based on NCD-1 quantum dots) compared to other GQD-based LED devices fabricated by the hydrothermal method61 as well as the chemical exfoliation technique.62 Although the NCD-1 device exhibits better performance, the fabrication technique and operating conditions may alter the LED stability and durability. Accordingly, this work demonstrates a feasibility using the combination of the NGQD and CNQD powder embedded polymeric film that can emit white-like light with high power-conversion efficiency and excellent photostability.
Conclusions
Highly fluorescent NGQDs and CNQDs with a Φ value of 68.1% have been synthesized using the SPMA technique. The SPMA method is an efficient and fast pathway for synthesizing quantum dots (composed of coexisting NGQDs and CNQDs) at 280 °C (only requires five minutes). The chemical recipe containing the N- and C-rich precursor significantly affected the chemical composition and the distribution of oxygenated/nitrogenated functionalities on the quantum dots. The quantum dots were well dispersed in three polar solvents (water, ethanol and NMP) and the suspensions were stable. The fluorescence behaviour of quantum dots is strongly dependent on the excitation wavelength and the solvent type. A new strategy for designing the quantum dots was proposed to possess a multiple band-gap structure, mainly attributed to the presence of g-C3N4, defect-related emissive traps, and grain boundaries. Accordingly, an appropriate excitation wavelength would induce conjugated π electrons to fulfill the most probable absorption band, emitting wavelength-dependent emissions including ultraviolet, visible and infrared light. It was also shown that the application of NGQDs and CNQDs as a highly fluorescent LED emitter results in emitting white-like light. Therefore, the fluorescent film synthesized in this work is very promising for applications within large-scale flexible solid-state lighting systems due to being inexpensive, fully flexible, easily scalable, thermally stable, and mechanically robust.
Methods
SPMA synthesis of NGQDs and CNQDs
The NGQD and CNQD samples were synthesized using the SPMA technique, mixing citric acid, urea and distilled water and subsequently heating the mixture at 280 °C for five minutes. The SPMA synthesis process was carried out at a home-made microwave reactor (total volume of the reactor: 60 L), equipped with an efficient microwave emitter (maximal power: 6000 W) and a rotary sample plate. Three samples (ca. 100 g) with different ratios of citric acid to urea (1/2, 1/1, and 2/1 in w/w; labeled NCD-1, NCD-2, and NCD-3 respectively) were placed on the sample plate with a rotational speed of 60 rpm. The SMPA method was conducted under an air atmosphere and provided in a high production yield of 40–50 wt%, demonstrating great potential for industrial applications. A combination of brown and black powders in the tubes was observed after the SPMA reaction. The powders were ball-milled subsequently and then sieved through a metallic screen (# 200 mesh). The solid precipitate was individually dispersed and washed using ultrapure water. The powders were finally centrifuged and collected at 15000 rpm for 30 minutes.
Characterization and optical properties of NGQDs and CNQDs
A high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM, FEI Talos F200s) operating at 200 kV was employed to capture micrographs. An inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy/mass spectrometer (ICP-OES/MS) was adopted to analyze the chemical compositions of all samples. An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Fison VG ESCA210) equipped with a Mg-Kα radiation emitter was used to characterize the chemical composition of the samples. The C 1s, N 1s and O 1s spectra were deconvoluted utilizing a non-linear least squares fitting algorithm with a symmetric Gaussian function. The surface composition of NGQD and CNQD powders was further characterized via applying a sensitivity factor. Electrochemical measurements were carried out in a homemade three-electrode cell with an electrochemical workstation (CHI 608) in which a platinum wire was employed as the counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, and the GQD-coated sheet with an active area of 2 cm2 was used as the working electrode. Aqueous Na2SO4 solution (1 M) was employed as the electrolyte. One experiment for obtaining tapping density of each sample was to fill the samples into a 10 mL volumetric cylinder. Through an ultrasonic shaking for 10 min, the GQD samples tend to become tightly packed stacking in the cylinders. We weighed the samples in the cylinder, getting the mass gained due to the presence of g-C3N4. Herein the GQD sample prepared from the weight ratio of citric acid to urea of 3/1 served as the standard, i.e., 100% production of NGQDs without any formation of g-C3N4. To obtain high accuracy, the experiments for each sample were carried out five times.
Ultraviolet–visible (UV-vis) spectra of NGQD and CNQD suspensions were recorded using an Agilent Cary 60 spectrometer (with a scan rate of 60 nm min−1). The solutions were prepared via dispersing 200 mg of GQs within 1000 mL of solvent. Three solvents including distilled water, ethanol, and NMP were used. To ensure a uniform dispersion, all suspensions were ultrasonically vibrated in a water bath at ambient temperature for 20 min. Since the quantum dots are soluble in the polar solvents; the resulting suspensions were very stable. The PL emission spectra of each suspension were recorded by using a fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi F-7000 FLS920P) at different wavelengths (320, 340, 360, 380, 410, 450, and 480 nm). The quantum yield (Φ) for each sample was measured and subsequently calibrated based on the characteristics of Coumarin (C9H6O2; molecular weight: 146; Φ: 73% at 373 nm excitation). The quantum yield corresponding to each sample was quantified using the following equation. Φ = Φr × [(PL area/OD)s/(PL area/OD)r] × ηs2/ηr2(1)
Here, subscripts “s” and “r” represent the sample (i.e., NQGD and CNQD) and the reference (i.e., Coumarin) respectively. Herein η represents the reflective index of the solvent, and the PL area and OD are the fluorescence area and absorbance value, respectively. The white LED device using the NCD-1 sample could be briefly described as follows. Transparent Si gel (2 g) was mixed together with the NCD-1 suspension (5 mL, concentration: 1 mg mL−1), and the mixture was stirred sufficiently to obtain a homogeneous slurry using a high performance homogenizer. Then the mixture was coated on a blue LED chip and solidified in a vacuum oven at 40 °C for 1 h and at 80 °C for 2 h sequentially.
