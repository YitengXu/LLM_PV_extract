    , Accepted 13th July 2018First published on 17th July 2018AbstractTo overcome the weakness of the organic hole transporting material in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), we developed inorganic copper antimony sulfide (Cu3SbS4) nanocrystals as a hole transporting material (HTM) for PSCs by a hot-injection and spray-deposition technique. We proved that the Cu3SbS4 nanocrystal layer can enhance hole injection inhibiting the charge-carrier recombination within the perovskite layer. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.7% was obtained for the Cu3SbS4-based devices with improved stability. This work offers a new route which employs copper antimony sulfide compounds as hole transporting materials for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.
Organic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been studied world-wide and undergone significant development since first reported in 2009.1 Due to their excellent material properties, such as a high optical absorption coefficient,1,2 high charge carrier mobility,3 and long diffusion lengths,4,5 the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has been boosted from 3.8%1 to 22.7%6,7 in only a few years. Despite an excellent photovoltaic performance, the instability of PSCs under environmental conditions is one of the main issues hindering the further development of PSCs.8 The stability of PSCs employing organic hole transporting materials (HTMs) such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-p-dimethoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD2) is inferior because of the hygroscopicity of the doped lithium salt. In addition, the price of spiro-OMeTAD is prohibitively high, impeding its large-scale applications. Therefore, developing stable and low-cost inorganic HTMs will provide an alternative to organic HTMs.
Recently, inorganic p-type semiconductors such as CuSCN,9–11 CuI,12,13 CuGaO2,14 MoO2,15 CuInS2,16 CZTS,17 CIGS,18 and TiS219 have been employed as alternative HTMs in PSCs due to their low cost, stability, ease of synthesis, and high mobility without additives. However, the choice of deposition method is limited due to the sensitivity of the perovskite layer to high-temperature (over 150 °C) processes and to a variety of solvents. For instance, the process for depositing some inorganic HTMs, e.g. CuOx,20 requires high-temperature treatment, which limits their application in the n–i–p architecture. Furthermore, in the n–i–p architecture, almost all of the solution-processable inorganic HTMs synthesized by the solution-process are deposited on the perovskite layer by a spin-coating method which would increase the cost of large-area PSCs.
In this work, we report a facile method of depositing a Cu3SbS4 nanocrystal layer as the HTM in a regular n–i–p architecture PSC based on a hot-injection and spray deposition technique. Copper antimony sulfides have also emerged as promising solar cell absorber layers,21–23 due to their appropriate optical and electrical properties, and the presence of Earth abundant elements in them. These copper antimony sulfide compound semiconductors have four common crystal phases: famatinite (Cu3SbS424), tetrahedrite (Cu12Sb4S1325), skinnerite (Cu3SbS326), and chalcostibite (CuSbS227). As a key member of the Cu–Sb–S family, famatinite Cu3SbS4 could be suitable for solar cells because of its direct optical band gaps in the range of 0.42–1.85 eV24 and high hole mobility (0.05–2 cm2 V−1 s−1).28 We primarily attempt to use famatinite Cu3SbS4 in perovskite solar cells by spray-depositing Cu3SbS4 nanocrystal ink. The as synthesized Cu3SbS4 nanocrystal layer has an optical bandgap of 0.89 eV and a hole mobility of 1.7 cm2 V−1 s−1. A spray-deposition method is an economical process whereby films can be deposited rapidly over a large area without high temperature treatment. We fabricated the PSCs in an n–i–p architecture and achieved a PCE of close to 9%. In addition, the stability of our PSCs was improved substantially due to the application of the Cu3SbS4 nanocrystals as a HTM.
The high-quality Cu3SbS4 nanocrystals were synthesized by a hot-injection method and dispersed in chlorobenzene forming a nanocrystal ink (see more details in the ESI†). In order to avoid shunting and to improve the stability of the derived PSCs, it is critical to form a dense Cu3SbS4 hole transporting layer with small particle sizes. The average size of the prepared Cu3SbS4 nanocrystals was found to be between 14–20 nm according to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1, ESI†). According to the selective area electron diffraction (SAED) image, the prepared Cu3SbS4 shows a polycrystalline nature. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) (Fig. 1b) illustrates that the nanocrystals possess crystalline surfaces and lattice fringes with an interplanar spacing of 3.1 Å, which can be ascribed to the (112) plane of famatinite Cu3SbS4. From an X-ray diffraction spectrum (Fig. 1c) of the Cu3SbS4 nanocrystals, the diffraction peaks can be identified as the famatinite structure (JCPDS 10-0472). There is a strong peak at ∼28.83°, which is assigned to the (112) plane indicating that the as-deposited Cu3SbS4 nanocrystals show a (112) preferred orientation, which is in agreement with previous reports.29 Other prominent peaks corresponding to the (204) and (116) planes can also be clearly observed. No other impurities were detected within the detection limit, indicating the phase purity of the Cu3SbS4 nanocrystals. Furthermore, there are three Raman peaks at 250, 318, and 349 cm−1 (Fig. S2, ESI†) which correspond to the Cu3SbS4 phase and are in accordance with previous reports.30 The atomic ratio of Cu:Sb:S in the nanocrystals determined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, as shown in Fig. S3, ESI†) is nearly 3:1:4, close to the stoichiometric composition of Cu3SbS4. The optical properties of the Cu3SbS4 nanocrystal film (on FTO-coated glass) were determined by UV-vis spectrophotometry, as shown in Fig. 1d. It is obvious from the curve that there is a strong absorption edge below approximately 1300 nm. The optical bandgap of the Cu3SbS4 nanocrystals was estimated to be 0.89 eV.

To investigate the feasibility of Cu3SbS4 nanocrystals as a HTM for charge extraction from the perovskite layer, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were performed (Fig. 2a and b). The PL emissions of all of the samples exhibited a single peak at approximately 760 nm with the HTM-free perovskite film showing the highest peak intensity, which could be owing to the strong band-to-band radiative recombination of photoinduced charge carriers in the HTM-free perovskite film. The intensities of the steady-state PL emission for samples with the Cu3SbS4 nanocrystal HTM and spiro-OMeTAD HTM were observed to be much lower than that of those without the HTM on the perovskite film, and the PL intensity of the sample with the Cu3SbS4 nanocrystal HTM was observed to be the lowest. As shown in the TRPL decay curves, it is notable that the perovskite film with the Cu3SbS4 HTM shows a faster decay than that with the spiro-OMeTAD HTM. Overall, the results suggest that Cu3SbS4 can enhance hole injection inhibiting charge-carrier recombination within the perovskite layer31 and act as a very promising HTM candidate for PSCs.

(d) Energy level diagrams of the perovskite/Cu3SbS4 configuration. 
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed to determine the valence band position of the Cu3SbS4 nanocrystals and perovskite (Fig. 2c). The work functions of the Cu3SbS4 nanocrystals (Φ(Cu3SbS4)) and perovskite (Φ(perovskite)) were determined to be 4.26 eV and 3.98 eV respectively. The valence band maximum onset VBM(Cu3SbS4) and VBM(perovskite) were determined to be at 0.18 eV and 1.44 eV, respectively. According to these UPS results, the energy level band diagram has been drawn and is shown in Fig. 2d. The 1.26 eV lower VBM(Cu3SbS4) of Cu3SbS4 indicates a favorable energy level alignment for hole extraction when the perovskite is used as a light absorber material. In addition, the higher CBM (height of about 1.4 eV) of Cu3SbS4 can block electrons from the perovskite (Fig. S4, ESI†).
To determine whether the Cu3SbS4 could be a competitive HTM candidate for perovskite solar cells, the completed devices with a planar n–i–p configuration were fabricated and are shown in Fig. 3a. The detailed fabrication procedures for these devices are described in the Experimental section. The Cu3SbS4 nanocrystal solution was spray-deposited onto the perovskite with an airbrush (Iwata Eclipse HP-CP) operated at 30 bar of head pressure. From the cross sectional SEM image (Fig. 3b), the individual layers of the perovskite/Cu3SbS4 can be distinguished by a thicknesses of 600 nm and 400 nm respectively. The Cu3SbS4 nanocrystals form a dense film which covers the underlying perovskite layer uniformly. Direct contact between the Cu3SbS4 HTM layer and the bottom SnO2 Electron Transport Material (ETM) layer is avoided by a compact perovskite layer to prohibit charge recombination. Fig. 4a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs employing Cu3SbS4 and spiro-OMeTAD HTMs, measured under an AM 1.5G spectrum at 100 mW cm−2. The device using the Cu3SbS4 HTM displays the best PCE of 8.7% with a Voc value of 0.80 V, a Jsc value of 19.4 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 55.96%. Compared to PSCs using a conventional spiro-OMeTAD HTM, the PCE is still quite low (8.7% vs. 19.5%) due to the poor Voc value, which may be caused by the smaller Fermi level splitting of Cu3SbS4 and the perovskite according to Fig. 2d. However, the Jsc value of the Cu3SbS4 device is slightly lower but still comparable to that of the spiro-OMeTAD device (19.04 vs. 21.86 mA cm−2), which indicates a good carrier transportation within Cu3SbS4. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the best devices with Cu3SbS4 and spiro-OMeTAD HTMs were also measured and are shown in Fig. 4b. The current density integrated from the corresponding EQE spectra is consistent with the Jsc value measured in the J–V curves. The device using a spiro-OMeTAD HTM demonstrates a nearly square EQE curve with a height over 80%, showing a slightly higher value than that of the device using a Cu3SbS4 HTM in the visible range, revealing a higher carrier collection efficiency which leads to a higher short-circuit current density. Additional information regarding the hysteresis of the cells can be found in the ESI† (Fig. S5). To summarize, Cu3SbS4 could be a competitive candidate as a hole transporting material for perovskite solar cells.

To understand the charge transport process in these devices, impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements were performed. Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the Nyquist plots obtained from cells with Cu3SbS4 and spiro-OMeTAD HTMs over a frequency range of 1 MHz to 1 kHz under short circuit conditions and AM 1.5G 1 sun illumination. The main arc in the middle frequency is ascribed to the recombination resistance, Rrec. In the PSCs the impedance arises from electrical transport, which is proportional to the amount of charge transfer resistance related to the perovskite interfaces. As can be observed, the device with a spiro-OMeTAD HTM had a slightly higher recombination resistance than the device with a Cu3SbS4 HTM. This indicates that the nanocrystals may cause more severe recombination in the device with a Cu3SbS4 HTM, which could explain its lower Voc value and FF compared with the spiro-OMeTAD device.
Finally, the stability of the PSCs with Cu3SbS4 and spiro-OMeTAD was investigated. Because the usage of a hygroscopic lithium salt doped in spiro-OMeTAD is unfavorable for PSC stability,32,33 the hydrophobic Cu3SbS4 nanocrystals are expected to be beneficial for PSC stability. To verify this, both devices were exposed directly to an ambient environment of 50 °C and 30% humidity without encapsulation. As shown in Fig. 5a, devices with Cu3SbS4 retained 75% of their original efficiencies after 25 days, while the spiro-OMeTAD device kept only 40% of its original efficiency after 20 days. The difference in device stability might be a result of the different hydrophobicities of the HTMs. The static contact angles of a water droplet on the surface of the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD, perovskite/Cu3SbS4 and perovskite were measured and are shown in Fig. 5b, c and Fig. S7 (ESI†), respectively. The perovskite exhibited poor hydrophilicity with a water contact angle of 51°. The spiro-OMeTAD cannot provide favorable protection for the perovskite with a water contact angle of 78°. However, the sample with the Cu3SbS4 nanocrystal HTM displays a remarkably larger contact angle of 109.49°. This indicates that the hydrophobic Cu3SbS4 HTM can efficiently prevent water from penetrating into the perovskite layer.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated that Cu3SbS4 nanocrystals can act as a solution-processable, inorganic hole transporting material for perovskite solar cells. The phase of the as synthesized nanocrystals was recognized as famatinite-Cu3SbS4. The best PCE achieved by the Cu3SbS4-based device was 8.7%. It shows a dramatically enhanced stability by keeping 75% of its original efficiency after being exposed to an ambient environment for 25 days, which is attributed to the hydrophobic nature of the Cu3SbS4 nanocrystals. However, the efficiency obtained with Cu3SbS4 is still lower than that obtained with spiro-OMeTAD, because the Fermi level splitting in Cu3SbS4 nanocrystals is narrower than that in spiro-OMeTAD. This paper shows the promising prospect of Cu3SbS4 nanocrystals as a low-cost and easily-fabricated HTM for efficient and stable PSCs. We hope this article will open up the promising prospect of copper antimony sulfur (Cu–Sb–S) compounds as low-cost and easily-fabricated HTMs for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.
