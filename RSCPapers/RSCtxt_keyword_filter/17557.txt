    , Accepted 14th September 2020First published on 14th September 2020AbstractWith hybrid lead halide perovskites, a new class of materials for photovoltaics emerged, approaching GaAs in their optoelectronic properties. However, issues concerning toxicity and instability of lead-based perovskites impede their commercialization. Therefore, alternative lead-free solution-processable semiconductors have attracted increasing attention. The focus is mainly on compounds with structural similarities to the three-dimensional network of the lead halide octahedra in the perovskite structure. Furthermore, additional metal halides or chalcogenides have emerged with non-perovskite-related crystal structures but promising physical properties. This review will discuss recent progress on lead-free perovskite-inspired materials suitable for optoelectronics, considering their structure as well as their physical properties and resulting implications for device applications.

Broader context
Renewable energy sources are required to cover the ever-growing energy demands of the world. Among renewable energy sources, sunlight belongs to the most abundant and easily accessible. In the last decade, a new solution-processable photovoltaic system emerged with hybrid halide lead perovskites serving as absorber layers. Thus, the field of very cost-effective and highly efficient photovoltaic technology advanced, enabling the design of versatile device configurations. For example, the fabrication of tandem devices becomes more facile with the upper cells made of perovskite-based devices requiring low temperatures for manufacturing using solution-based processes. However, perovskite-based technologies suffer from low stability against moisture and high temperatures, limiting their longevity. Besides, the toxicity of soluble lead salts is a concern, especially considering large-scale deployment. Therefore, lead-free perovskite and perovskite-inspired absorber layers have recently come into research focus. Typically, the central metal lead is replaced by other less toxic metal ions while retaining octahedral coordination with the halide ions. Our review discusses the various new structural combinations that have emerged for lead-free absorber layers, including the synthesis, physical properties and advantages and challenges with a view to photovoltaic applications.

1. Introduction
Hybrid lead halide perovskites were introduced in photovoltaic (PV) applications in 2009.1 Within only ten years, their power conversion efficiency (PCE) in PV applications was improved to over 25%.2 Hence, perovskite-based technologies are the first solution-processable PVs to have surpassed the efficiency of polycrystalline and thin film silicon solar cells.
The excellent performance of these perovskites in solar cells originates from their superior optoelectronic properties. In particular, the light absorption and defect physics facilitate the application of perovskite absorber layers in highly efficient photovoltaics. The absorption coefficient of 105 cm−1 of hybrid lead halides is even one order of magnitude higher than that observed for the best-performing PV absorber GaAs. Therefore, very thin perovskite films already result in highly efficient solar cells, enabled by direct band gap transitions, very low exciton binding energies (negligible at room temperature (RT)), excellent and balanced charge carrier mobilities, long photogenerated carrier lifetimes in the μs-range, diffusion lengths beyond 3.5 μm and small hole or electron effective masses of around 0.1 m0.3–7 The extraordinary charge transport properties correlate with low trap densities of around 1015–1016 cm−3 and Urbach energies as small as 12.6 meV in perovskite thin films, resulting from advantageous defect physics.3,6–11
A unique feature of lead-based perovskites is that shallow rather than deep level defects form during crystallization. Due to the high formation energies of deep level defects, the grain boundaries in polycrystalline thin films are quite benign and the shallow nature of the defects can even become effective doping depending on the growth conditions if for example synthesis conditions with excess halides or organic cations are chosen.11,12 This excellent defect tolerance is often attributed to the combination of high crystal symmetry in the corner-sharing structure of [PbX6] octahedra with mixed ionic-covalent bonding.11,13,14 Consequently, the strong Pb-lone-pair s-orbital and iodine p-orbital antibonding coupling establishes direct p–p transitions and narrow band gaps, desirable for solar cell applications.11,13,14
The highly ionic nature of perovskite bonding also results in some significant drawbacks, such as the instability of the materials in polar solvents and at higher temperatures.15 Especially, hybrid perovskites containing methylammonium (MA) as the cation are sensitive towards moisture and elevated temperatures. Under both conditions, the perovskite usually dissociates to the lead halide and the methylammonium salt and further dissipates with the release of methylamine and hydroiodide.314 Thus, the application of these materials in devices is still challenging. Tackling the instability issues, researchers invested considerable effort into developing strategies for efficient encapsulation and interfacial functionalization. The resulting stabilized perovskite-based devices show some promise in long-term stability.15 However, the toxicity of lead (in these somewhat soluble materials) is also of great concern for the commercialization of the materials, presenting health risks for the blood, kidneys, liver, testes, brain and nervous system.16,17 These risks are attributed to the binding affinity of lead to thiol and cellular phosphate groups of numerous enzymes, proteins and cell membranes.18
To minimize the amount of hazardous potential lead waste from defective solar panels in the future, recycling of these solar cells becomes crucial. Here, the degradation pathway towards the lead halide is beneficial to recycle the precursor by dissolving the lead halide film in a polar solvent, recrystallizing the pure lead-salt and reusing it as a perovskite precursor.315 Thus, avoiding the release of lead waste to the environment is possible under the condition of strict regulations concerning the recycling of perovskite-based solar cells and thorough compliance. Still, the combination of the above challenges concerning the perovskite instability combined with its toxicity requires that research also focuses on alternative, intrinsically more stable PV absorber materials with less toxic central metal atoms.
After the introduction of hybrid lead halide perovskites for photovoltaic applications, other lead-free combinations followed, inspired by the superior characteristics of the lead-based compounds. Primarily, the focus is on absorber layers with perovskite-like crystal structures, leading to the investigation of various compounds combining halides (X) or chalcogenides (Ch) with central metal ions from all over the periodic table of the elements (see Table 1 and Fig. 1). Many systems contain corner-sharing octahedral building blocks in the crystal structure. Additionally, new, structurally related systems with edge- or face-sharing octahedral structures emerge that are solution-processable and show promising optoelectronic properties but crystallize in non-perovskite-like structures.

All values are colour coded with respect to the different central metal cations and divided into 3D, 2D or 0D structural coordination. In full colour the materials crystallize in perovskite-like structures, and marked with symbols filled with yellow for antimony- and bismuth-based compounds the material crystallizes in non-perovskite-like structures. 
The main potential advantage of perovskite solar cells in comparison with more efficient, stable and commercially standardized devices like silicon solar cells is their solution processability. Being solution-processable can reduce the deposition temperature of perovskite-based devices to below 100 °C, thus drastically reducing the energy payback time of devices. While the highly optimized and reliable silicon technology will most likely remain as the basis of many photovoltaic devices, the low-energy fabrication techniques of perovskite absorbers provide potential for the design of flexible and tandem solar cells, as well as the development of fast roll-to-roll processing techniques.316,317
Another essential requirement for lead-free absorbers is their stability against illumination, moisture, air or elevated temperatures. The main techniques used to analyse the stability of the material are X-ray diffraction (XRD), photoluminescence (PL), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) or analysis of the PV parameters, similar to lead-based research.314 Due to the higher air sensitivity of some compounds compared to lead-based systems, some analysis techniques require modifications, such as sealed samples or sample holders or measurements under an N2 environment instead of air.29,92,122 In terms of XRD analysis in situ measurements in a synchrotron become a preferred technique to avoid or at least minimize the air exposure of oxidation-sensitive compounds.92,270
In this review, we divide the existing systems into perovskite-like and non-perovskite-like structures. Thus, the compositions either consist of corner-sharing octahedral (“perovskite-like”) structures or edge- or face-sharing octahedral structures with different dimensionalities. We discuss the different structure types of lead-free absorber layers with their advantages and drawbacks concerning the physical properties, as well as the stability of the materials toward humidity and high temperature. Furthermore, we discuss the performance of the resulting photovoltaic or other optoelectronic devices.
2. 3D perovskite-like compounds
The term perovskite arises from the materials’ crystal structure-type and general formula ABX3, CaTiO3 being the first discovered compound with this name.19 In hybrid halide lead-based perovskites, the general structural formula is AIMIIX3, with the halides (X) octahedrally coordinating the central metal ion (MII), and the monovalent cations (A) cuboctahedrally coordinated. Fig. 2 illustrates schematics of the 3D perovskite and double-perovskite structures. The critical parameter to estimate the stability of the MIIX6 octahedra is the octahedral factor μ (see eqn (1)).20 A ratio of the radii of the divalent metal and halide atoms leading to values of μ between 0.442 and 0.895 usually corresponds to the formation of stable structures.21 The Goldschmidt tolerance factor t gives information on perovskite structure distortion based on the ratio of the radii of both cations in the structure (see eqn (2)).22 Values of the factor t between 1.0 and 0.9 indicate the formation of a cubic structure. Lower numbers for t between 0.8 and 0.89 indicate the formation of a distorted perovskite with an orthorhombic, tetragonal or rhombohedral structure. For t below 0.8, the A-site cation is too small to form the perovskite structure, leading to alternatives like ilmenite structures, while with t exceeding 1, the A-site cation is too big, leading to alternatives such as hexagonal structures.20,23,24 (1) (2)To replace the lead (MII) but retain the perovskite crystal structure, several divalent metal cations are suitable considering their size, such as SnII, GeII, MgII, CaII, SrII, BaII, CuII, FeII, PdII, and EuII. Most studies on lead substitutes are tin- and germanium-based, discussed in more detail below.

The monovalent cations A are not illustrated but coordinate cuboctahedrally with the metal halide octahedra. 
2.1 Tin-based perovskites (ASnIIX3)
With tin serving as the central metal ion in halide perovskites, close equivalents to lead-based systems form including phases such as the black perovskites MASnI3, FASnI3 or CsSnI3.25,26 Due to the smaller ionic radius of tin compared to lead, the resulting compounds crystallize predominantly in more distorted structures. In particular, MASnI3 crystallizes in a tetragonal structure, while CsSnI3 and FASnI3 adopt orthorhombic crystal structures in the black polymorph at room temperature.25,81–84,321 In the case of the purely inorganic cesium-based compound CsSnI3, a transition to the tetragonal phase occurs around 89 °C and to the cubic phase at 167 °C, while it melts at 435 °C, whereas MASnI3 and FASnI3 decompose already at 200 °C.83,84
Similar to the lead equivalents, tin iodide-based perovskite compounds exhibit direct band gaps of around 1.2–1.4 eV, negligible exciton binding energies (below thermal energy at room temperature (25 meV)), high carrier mobility (up to 2320 cm2 V s−1 for the electron mobility and 322 cm2 V s−1 hole mobility) and long carrier diffusion lengths of over 500 nm.25,85–87 All these properties are highly desirable for solar cell applications. However, the temperature trends of mobility in FASnI3 suggest that the mobility is limited mostly by interactions with phonons, which poses a fundamental limit.88 The very high doping densities cause suppressed charge-carrier mobility through scattering with ionized dopants. For example, the mobility of FASnI3 of 470 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 50 K reduces to 67 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature (RT).88 These high doping densities can be derived from the materials’ electronic structure with stronger s–p antibonding coupling near the VBM than the one discovered for lead-based perovskites and high energy Sn 5s2 states, making the Sn–I bonds less stable.89 Various aspects influence the doping densities in tin-based perovskites. The growth conditions, which can be either Sn-poor or Sn-rich, bring forth in CsSnI3 p-type conductivity or n-type conductivity, respectively.90 Additionally, tin-based perovskites are susceptible to self-doping with holes resulting from oxidation of SnII to SnIV.91 The instability of SnII against oxidation to SnIV becomes especially evident upon exposure of samples to air or moisture, but degradation also occurs in inert conditions due to photo-instability.92,318 Here, different processes occur strongly depending on the monovalent cation choice and atmosphere. The tin perovskite either disproportionates to SnIV and Sn0 forming the cubic 0D phase of A2SnIVX6 or forms an oxide-containing phase.318,319,321 Encapsulated or stored in air, MASnI3 or CsSnI3 films even completely and irreversibly convert to the 0D phase, resulting in higher resistivity and altered p- or n-doping.209,318,319,321 Therefore, the stability and reproducibility of Sn-based perovskites is strongly affected by the self-doping mechanism.26,93–98
With the choice of monovalent cations, the degree of self-doping varies. Due to the larger size FA, the antibonding coupling between Sn-s and I-p (iodine-p) is weaker in FASnI3 than in MASnI3. Thus, the conductivity is tunable from p-type to intrinsic with the choice of the organic cation.99 In contrast, MASnI3 with the smaller MA cation remains unipolar with high p-type character.
It is also possible to inhibit the formation of SnIV with the addition of hydrazinium or SnF2 during synthesis, independent of the monovalent cation size.100,318,320 In the all-inorganic compound CsSnI3, the reduction of self-doping through SnIV formation with the addition of SnF2 is highly disadvantageous for thin film synthesis because of phase separation.98,100,101 In the case of MASnI3 or FASnI3, varying the concentration of SnF2 influences the thin film morphology in addition to the reduction of p-doping from the oxidising tin. This influence on the thin film morphology is rather dramatic, with grain sizes varying between 200 nm and 1 μm with higher SnF2 concentration, see Fig. 3.323

Similar to SnF2, SnCl2 passivates the perovskite grains against oxidation. However, the perovskite precursor solution requires the additional presence of hydroxybenzene sulfonic acid to avoid the formation of large tin chloride aggregates on top of the perovskite layer.274
There is no visible influence on the morphology but a significant impact on SnIV reduction with the addition of Sn0 nanoparticles. The presence of Sn0 in the precursor solution with an optimal concentration of 1 mol% reduces the content of SnVI at the perovskite film surface. The content of the oxidized tin drops from 15.5% to 5.3% and further to 0% after argon etching with 10 mol% SnF2 accelerating this process.268
In general, synthesis of tin-based perovskite thin films is more challenging than with the lead equivalents. The quality of the film morphology is defined by a lack of control during crystallization, usually resulting in pinholes.102 This missing control is mainly attributed to the swift reaction kinetics of organic/inorganic halides with tin halide salts.103–105 Several groups developed strategies with a focus on slowing down the perovskite formation – arriving at a similar conclusion as for the lead equivalents – showing that crystallization through an intermediate phase leads to the highest quality morphologies.106–108 The proposed intermediate phases form through complexation of the tin ions with Lewis-bases such as with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or triethyl phosphine, slowing down crystallization for high-quality thin films.94,109 Also two-step approaches result in promising tin perovskite crystallinity with grain sizes over 1 μm, such as firstly forming hydrazinium tin iodide and secondly exchanging the monovalent cation with MA.276
In devices, tin-perovskites offer diverse application options. The high hole mobilities of tin perovskites (e.g., 585 cm2 V s−1 at RT) initially inspired their application as HTMs in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).83 In solid-state thin film devices, a cesium-based absorber layer (“PK”) first appeared in Schottky-contact-type devices with the architecture indium tin oxide (ITO)/PK/Au/Ti. These Schottky-contact-type devices reach a PCE of 0.9%, followed by HTM-free perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with an efficiency of 3.56% at the beginning and 4.81% after further improvement.110–112
In photovoltaic devices, the addition of SnF2 to the tin-based perovskite absorber layer is crucial for their enhanced stability with increased JSC and VOC.111 However, in a direct comparison of various cations (MA, FA and Cs), the effect of SnF2 doping on the device performance differs. In the aforementioned HTM-free perovskite solar cells (PSCs), SnF2 doping significantly improves the CsSnI3-based devices to 4.81%, whereas the MASnI3-based devices remain constant and the FASnI3-based devices degrade with time.112 Using similar architectures with mesoporous (m-)TiO2, the MASnI3-based devices also reach efficiencies of about 6.4%, indicating the possible excellent device performance with organic monovalent cations. However, even with encapsulation, the devices still quickly degrade when tested under ambient conditions due to a lack of SnF2 doping.104
Regarding the impact of the organic monovalent cations, FASnI3 is the more stable compound towards oxidation than MASnI3 and therefore more promising for device applications.86,319 Therefore, FA-based tin perovskite thin films underwent more synthetic efforts with particular focus on the more homogeneous distribution of SnF2. The use of an SnF2–pyrazine complex leads to the best results in device stability and reproducibility. Devices encapsulated with a cover glass using a polymer and an epoxy resin maintain 98% of the initial PCE for 100 d of storage in ambient conditions.113 A different thin film synthesis approach using diethyl ether and an optimized SnF2 concentration with a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) bottom surface results in higher initial performance with 6.22% efficiency.323 This performance drops to 85% of the initial value after continuous illumination for 30 d of the encapsulated cells.323 Mixing the cations FA and MA enables the fabrication of tin-based devices with increased device efficiencies of 8.12% (see Fig. 3). The device stability remains similar, a drop to 80% of the initial value after 400 h if stored in a nitrogen-filled glovebox.114 With the addition of MABr instead of MAI in the precursor mixture, the device stability remains similar, but the efficiency increases to 9.31% with more preferential alignment in one direction of the perovskite crystallites.277
Using bulky organic additives during the FASnI3 synthesis enables the fabrication of stable devices with over 10% efficiency. Successfully applied organic additives are ethylene diamine, pentafluoridophenyl-oxy-ethyl-ammonium iodide, phenylhydrazine hydrochloride or 4-(aminomethyl)piperidinium (4AMP).115,269,271,275,281 With these organic cations, the corresponding devices are stable up to 500 h under constant illumination. Twice as long stable power output with a similar device efficiency is reached by devices containing a mixture of a tin halide amorphous layer and cesium-formamidinium tin iodide polycrystals.308 This structure effectively blocks the outside oxygen and moisture and also suppresses the ion diffusion inside the devices.308
Mixing tin and germanium central metal ions opens an additional possibility to vary the direct band gap size from 1.3 to 2.0 eV of the MA-based perovskite. When containing 50% Ge, the perovskite features the lowest disorder with Urbach energies of around 47 meV, which is the lowest among the entire family, exhibiting a band gap of 1.5 eV.116 The trap densities are significantly suppressed from 1015–1017 cm−3 to 108–1014 cm−3 with Ge addition, which improves the diffusion length to 1 μm.305 The related composition CsSn0.5Ge0.5I3 achieves promising efficiencies of over 7% in solar cells, as shown in Fig. 4.117,305 Additionally, the devices are quite stable, with less than 10% decay in efficiency after 500 h of continuous operation in a nitrogen atmosphere under one-sun illumination, showing higher potential compared to both options on their own.117 Ito et al. suggest the oxidation of GeII to GeIV to form a thin GeO2 protecting layer and therefore passivate the perovskite surface, improving the stability under ambient conditions.118 Starting with passivation through Ge-doping and substituting FA with the larger size cation source ethylene diammonium (EDA), the tin-based devices further improve, reaching a PCE of 11.75%. After posttreatment with the Lewis-base ethylene diamine, the device efficiency additionally increases to 13.24%.28 Here, VOC is impressively high at 0.84 V.28 Such impressive efficiencies were only realized before with CsSnI3 quantum rods sandwiched between TiO2 and Spiro-OMeTAD, resulting in a PCE of 13% with a voltage of 0.86 V.310

The use of metal oxides as charge transport materials in the majority of lead-based devices is often the cause of a difference in forward and reverse scans (hysteresis) in JV-scans that is reversible. In Sn-based devices the presence of metal oxide charge transport layers usually affects the device stability irreversibly. Therefore, tin-based devices with efficiencies above 10% mostly contain organic charge transport materials such as phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) or PEDOT:PSS with no significant hysteresis during the forward and reverse scanning.115,117,269,271,275,277,281,305,308,310
In the direct comparison of lead-based perovskites and tin-based perovskites, the photovoltaic device stability is more critical for the latter, with generally significantly lower-performing devices. Additionally, it is unclear if tin is a significantly less toxic alternative since SnI2 might be as harmful as PbI2.119 In an experiment with SnI2 or PbI2 added to an aqueous environment of zebrafish Danio rerio embryos, both compounds are shown to be lethal.119 However, the tin salt releases significantly higher amounts of HI in water than the lead salt, which has the primal fatal effect rather than the toxicity of the heavy metal itself.119 Thus, the tin perovskite instability with the fast oxidation of SnII to the less active SnIV oxides might be beneficial under toxicological considerations.
2.2 Germanium-based perovskites (AGeIIX3)
The element germanium provides another less toxic equivalent alternative to the element lead.120 The higher position of germanium in the same main-group (compared to Pb) implies that Ge features a more electronegative behavior, a more covalent bonding character with halides and a reduced ionic radius of GeII (73 pm). According to the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, MAGeX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) fits in the range of expected ideal PK structure conditions with t values between 0.97 and 1.03.30,121 Experimentally, AGeI3 (A = Cs, MA, FA) crystallizes in a trigonally distorted CaTiO3 structure with a 3D framework consisting of corner-sharing GeI6 octahedra.122 These black perovskite phases with a direct band gap remain stable within the range of PV device working temperatures.29 The direct band gap ranges from 1.6–2.5 eV for the iodide-based perovskites depending on the monovalent cation, see Fig. 4a.29,122 The remarkable dependence on the cation is the strongest compared to lead- or tin-based perovskites.
The reduced inert electron pair effect going up in the 4th group of the periodic table of elements causes further increased instability towards oxidation compared to tin. Therefore, most investigations on germanium-based perovskites are theoretical.29,122 Combining the theoretical and experimental data reveals the emergence of metallic conductivity in the hybrid materials due to the fast oxidation of GeII and predicts short-circuit behaviour in PVs similar to some Sn-based perovskites.29,84,98 We note that similar to tin-based halide perovskites, the germanium-based equivalent qualifies as a good HTM according to density-functional theory (DFT) calculations.123
In practical applications, the reduced material stability towards oxidation is not the only limiting factor. The Ge-based precursors show low solubility in polar solvents, causing non-adequate thin film morphologies. Even in less morphology-sensitive architectures using mesoporous TiO2, the achieved device performance is deficient at 0.2%.29 Only with the synthesis of high-quality nanorods of CsGeX3 do photovoltaic devices reach efficiencies of 4.94%.306 An additional factor contributing to the low device performance is the limited VOC originating from the defect chemistry in the material.123
Iodide substitution by bromide leads to an improvement of the solar cell performance along with a slight enhancement of the stability of the germanium perovskite.31 With the substitution of 10% of the iodide with bromide, the power conversion efficiencies reach up to 0.57%.31 However, these MAGeI2.7Br0.3 based planar solar cells remain quite unstable, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) drop to 0.21% after an EQE measurement in a sealed measuring box.31
2.3 Other main-group-based perovskites (AMIIX3)
According to the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, MgII, CaII, SrII and BaII with ionic radii ranging between 86 pm and 149 pm are suitable candidates for MII ions in halide PK structures. Additionally, their high abundance in the Earth's crust, non-toxicity and stable MII oxidation state are attractive features for lead-free and stable absorber layers.23,124 However, the typical wide band gaps of experimentally examined compounds and instability towards moisture hinder their solar cell applications.
DFT calculations on magnesium-based perovskites with the general formula AMgI3 predict tunability with the choice of monovalent cation A. Assuming that the compounds crystallize in a 3D perovskite-like structure, the calculated direct band gaps are 0.9 eV, 1.5 eV and 1.7 eV for FAMgI3, MAMgI3 and CsMgI3, respectively.125 However, according to theoretical calculations on the formation energy of CsMgI3 in a 3D perovskite-like structure, the crystallization of the compound is very unlikely.126 Thus, experimental evidence on CsMgI3 only exists with face-sharing infinite chains of MgI6 octahedra (CsNiCl3 structure-type) with very wide band gaps of approximately 4.8 eV.127 With EuII doping, the wide band gap material acts as a promising yellow light emitter.128
DFT calculations also predict a stable PK structure for MACaI3 with a band gap of 2.95 eV.124 The synthesized MACaI3 and MACaI3−xClx compounds adopt a pseudocubic structure with a band gap of 3.78 eV, which is not suitable for PV applications. Additionally, experimental investigations show instability towards moisture and low mobilities.23
According to the Goldschmidt rules and quantum mechanical analysis, SrII is the most promising central metal ion in this group of four, but the band gap of MASrI3 is again high at 3.6 eV.129 The high gap arises due to the low electronegativity of Sr combined with missing d valence electrons.129 Strontium-based perovskites are also unstable under ambient conditions due to their hygroscopic nature.124
The Goldschmidt tolerance factor t for MABaI3 is – at 0.797 – close to the lead analogue with a t value of 0.83. However, DFT calculations predict a band gap of 3.3 eV due to a low work function and the low electronegativity of barium.124 The material is also susceptible towards moisture, which hampers synthesis and characterization.124
2.4 Perovskites resulting from chalcogenide-substitution (AMIVCh3, AMIII(X,Ch)3)
Substituting halides with chalcogenides changes the bonding character to the central metal ion to be more covalent, which can improve the stability of the perovskite. In particular, zirconium-based chalcogenide perovskites (AZrCh3) show promising characteristics for PV applications, with DFT calculations predicting a direct band gap (BG) of 1.68 eV for (NH3NH3)ZrS3.130 Experimentally, the synthesis of all inorganic zirconium-based (and related) compounds by high-temperature sulfurization of oxide PK analogues with CS2 results in comparably promising band gap properties. Here, the direct BG can be tuned either by inorganic cation variation or by chalcogenide variation, ranging from 1.73 eV to 2.87 eV for the systems SrTiS3, CaZrS3, SrZrS3 and BaZr(OxS1−x)3.131 All compounds show excellent chemical stability under ambient conditions due to the more covalent bonding between the transition metals and the chalcogenides. However, their required synthesis temperature above 1000 °C hampers their application in photovoltaic devices.131
So far, the application of BaZrS3 is only possible in photodetectors. The band gap of 1.75 eV is comparable to that of MAPbI3, but the significantly higher environmental stability of BaZrS3 outperforms the lead-based perovskite by a factor exceeding two in terms of responsivity of the photodetectors after four weeks. Additionally, the material also shows promise with a high figure-of-merit for thermoelectric energy conversion.132
The only chalcogenide-based perovskite photovoltaic devices reported to date consist of a pure oxide perovskite BiFeO3 absorber layer in all-oxide heterostructures with SrRuO3 bottom and tin-doped indium oxide top electrodes. The high direct band gap of 2.76 eV limits the device efficiency, with a very low current density of 0.01 mA cm−2.133–135
Mixing chalcogenides and halides in the perovskite structure is another promising alternative to improve the stability in the ambient atmosphere and to narrow the direct band gaps compared to pure halide compounds.136 According to DFT calculations, the direct BGs of MABiChX2 vary between 1.24 and 2.00 eV.137 However, we note that other DFT calculations, coupled with experimental investigations, reveal the thermodynamic instability of the related MASbSI2 PK material towards decomposition into secondary phases.136 Therefore, it is unclear if PV devices implementing a MASbSI2 absorber layer with reasonable PCE values around 3% are pure or consist of MA3Sb2I9 and Sb2S3 heterostructures.32
2.5 Double perovskites (A2MIMIIIX6)
Double perovskites or ‘elpasolites’ named after K2NaAlF6 are perovskite structures with alternating central metal ions of MI and MIII oxidation states instead of only MII central ions (see Fig. 2). About 9520 combinations are possible if ignoring the phase stability. However, most of the already investigated combinations do not meet the criteria of the band gap size and charge carrier transport properties.138 Generally, alkaline metal MI cations are discarded due to low-dimensional structure formation and large BGs resulting in the associated double perovskite structures.139–141 Regarding the selection criteria for MIII central metal cations, the main-group metals appear to be more suitable than transition metals. With multiple oxidation states and partially occupied d- or f-orbitals, the transition metals are prone to introducing a high concentration of defect states.
Based on theoretical calculations, the best conditions considering optical absorption and electronic properties suitable for solar cell applications are predicted for MI = In, Tl and MIII = Sb, Bi.142 Bismuth or antimony are much less toxic than Pb and therefore a suitable alternative for the central metal cation.143,144 Thallium, on the other hand, is one of the most toxic heavy metals.145 Therefore, indium (although being scarce) appears to be the most promising alternative for the monovalent central metal ion in double perovskites with the potential of optimal optoelectronic properties. Other computational studies of the materials Cs2InSbCl6 and Cs2InBiCl6 agree with the prediction of superior photovoltaic properties with direct BGs of around 1 eV and small effective masses for both electrons and holes.146 However, the intrinsic instability of Cs2InBiCl6 and Cs2InSbCl6 due to spontaneous oxidation of InI to InIII hinders the application of the materials in optoelectronic devices.147
According to another theoretical study of the inorganic double perovskites A2MIMIIIX6 with MI = Cu, Ag, Au; MIII = Sb, Bi and X = Cl, Br, I, numerous variations of the band gap are possible, ranging between 0 and 2.7 eV.148 So far, the only double perovskite combination applied in PV devices is Cs2AgBiBr6 with an indirect band gap of 1.95 eV.33 In addition to the undesirable indirect BG nature, the defect chemistry intrinsically limits the photovoltaic performance of thin film devices. Here, both shallow and deep defect states form readily, unlike in lead-based perovskites. The shallow defect states consist mainly of Ag vacancies, leading to an intrinsic p-type conductivity, while Bi vacancies and AgBi antisites cause the dominant deep defect states.149 Thus, controlling the material growth conditions can suppress or encourage defect formation, such as Br-poor conditions inhibiting deep defects.149 The high density of traps limits the charge carrier diffusion lengths in thin films to 30 nm.295 Single crystals show a relatively low density of trap states in the range of 1010 cm−3 and the measured diffusion lengths exceed 1 μm since a large number of trap states are within 20 nm of the surface.150,298 Similar to the state-of-the-art lead-based perovskites, phonon scattering is the dominant scattering mechanism determining the charge carrier mobility in these double perovskites.151 The clear advantage of the all-inorganic double perovskite material class of Cs2AgBiX6 is its improved stability against heat and moisture in direct comparison with lead-based compounds.35 Only after exposure to air and light in ambient conditions for weeks does some degradation occur, and Cs2AgBiBr6 serving as the absorber layer in solar cells remains stable under working conditions for 100 min without encapsulation.35,36
The fabrication of high-quality thin films of Cs2AgBiBr6 usually requires a high temperature above 250 °C, as shown in Fig. 5c.152 Implementing these high-quality layers, the devices reach efficiencies of over 2% in mesoporous or planar architectures without hysteresis.36,152 Using a dye at the top perovskite/HTM interface leads to the best device efficiency so far of 2.84%, see Fig. 5.279 The dye broadens the absorption spectrum of the device, suppresses charge carrier recombination, accelerates the hole extraction at a more appropriate energy level alignment and enhances the device stability under ambient conditions.279 In general, devices based on Cs2AgBiBr6 show low hysteresis between the forward and reverse curve, especially with devices based on organic charge transport layers but also with m-TiO2.152,279

Further improvement of the photovoltaic performance results from doping the Cs2AgBiBr6 ‘alloy’ with Tl. The doping results in a quasi-direct and more narrow band gap material with values up to 1.4 eV and 1.57 eV for direct and indirect transitions, respectively.153 However, even with a low doping concentration of thallium, the toxicity of the metal is too severe to be considered for photovoltaic applications. With sulphide-doping, the BG of Cs2AgBiBr6 remains similar, but the intrinsic light absorption of Cs2AgBiBr6 is enhanced, resulting in a 50% rise of the current densities in the devices.154 The doping with RbI in (Cs1−xRbx)2AgBiBr6 enhances the absorption at long wavelengths, which results in devices with a PCE of 1.52%, a nearly 15% enhancement directly compared to the standard devices.297
Nanoparticles of Cs2AgBiX6 also show potential for optoelectronic applications requiring emission from 395–577 nm, after controlling surface defects via oleic acid passivation.155 Furthermore, starting from Cs2AgBiBr6 nanocrystals (NCs), the more narrow BG iodide-based compound Cs2AgBiI6 can be synthesized through anion exchange but becomes very unstable towards decomposition to Cs3Bi2I9.156 On the other hand, the hybrid MA2AgBiBr6 bulk material remains stable up to a temperature of around 550 K, but without evident advantage in comparison with the all-inorganic (Cs) equivalent, since the indirect BG increases to 2.02 eV.34 Notably, on mixing the trivalent metal cations antimony and bismuth in Cs2AgBi1−xSbxBr6, BG tunability arises in the range from 2.0 to 1.6 eV.151 The synthesis of the pure antimony-based Cs2AgSbBr6 double perovskite with a BG of 1.93 eV, however, is challenging due to the low formation enthalpy of the Cs3Sb2Br9 side product.303
Considering additional modifications of the double perovskite composition, the substitution of AgI with NaI or CuI leads to compounds with similar promising optoelectronic properties according to theoretical calculations.148,282 However, considering the high energy Cu 3d10 orbitals, the [CuX6] octahedra are thermodynamically unstable and decompose into tetrahedral non-PK like coordination.157 The heterovalent paramagnetic CuII, on the other hand, is a successful dopant in Cs2AgSbCl6, narrowing the BG from 2.6 eV to 1 eV with the substitution of silver and antimony by 20 mol% CuII.38 The resulting material is stable for over one year at high temperature up to 250 °C and high humidity levels.38 Pure Cs2AgSbCl6 appears to be less stable in humid conditions than Cs2AgInCl6 or CsPbCl3.290
Substitution with AuI is feasible in the material class of Cs2AuIAuIIIX6 (I, Br, Cl) featuring tetragonal 3D double perovskite structures.158–160,275,326 These pure gold-based compounds are of most interest due to their potential for superconductors.159 However, the band gap variation between 2.04 eV and 1.31 eV for the chloride- or iodide-based compounds indicates the potential of the material for PV applications.161,162,326 As for the lead-iodide analogue Cs2AuAuI6, the calculated photovoltaic potential for an only 50 nm thin absorber amounts to a PCE of 18%, while MAPbI3 would reach only about 8% in the same device configuration.163 So far, challenges considering the thin film synthesis hinder actual device fabrication.
Another substitution option in double perovskites is indium in its more oxidation-stable state of MIII. The compounds Cs2AgInCl6 and Cs2AgInBr6 are direct BG materials in contrast to the majority of double perovskite combinations (see Fig. 5e). However, the broad BG between 2.4 and 3.5 eV, the materials’ poor stability under illumination and the parity forbidden transitions make the materials unsuitable for PV applications.142,164,165,284,285 With SbIII doping in Cs2NaInCl6, parity forbidden transitions might be overcome according to calculations and the material exhibits a PLQE of 76% which remains stable for 1000 h under constant UV illumination.299 Doping with AgI similarly improves the PL of Cs2NaInCl6 and stability of nanocrystals in ambient air.292 Therefore, the compound is attractive for other optoelectronic applications. For example, its reversible photosensitivity and the long lifetime NIR emission at 994 nm of Yb3+-doped Cs2AgInCl6 nanocrystals are promising properties.164,166 Similar to the indium-based double perovskites, also the gallium-based compounds Cs2LiGaBr6 and Cs2NaGaBr6 have direct BGs, according to theoretical calculations. Here, the absorption is even similar to the lead-based analogues with BG values of 1.966 eV and 1.762 eV, respectively.301
Similar to the perovskite structure analogue, the exchange of the halides with chalcogenides retains the double perovskite structure. Therefore, the cubic oxide double perovskite Ba2AgIO6 (with IVII) is a promising PV candidate with a direct band gap of 1.93 eV, correlating with a broad PL signal at the same energy. The compound is also low-temperature and solution-processable, which opens new opportunities in optoelectronic and energy applications (see Fig. 5d and e).39 A more narrow but indirect band gap of 1.88 eV corresponds to the oxide double perovskite KBaTeBiO6. The calculated effective mass of the charge carriers for KBaTeBiO6 is comparable to the best performing Bi-halide double perovskites and, therefore, they appear to be more promising due to their more narrow BGs.300
3. 2D Ruddlesden–Popper compounds
Ruddlesden–Popper compounds are generally described with the formula A2MIIX4. Here, instead of interconnected metal-halide octahedra in a 3D network like in the perovskite structure, the corner-sharing metal-halide octahedra are interconnected in two dimensions and separated by space or large organic monovalent cations in the third dimension (see Fig. 6). Hence, the 2D layered structure mainly forms if the A cation size is larger than the ionic radius of the 3D perovskite central metal ions or often if a transition metal is a central metal in the octahedral halide coordination, especially with a small ionic radius. K2NiF4 is the stereotype in the Ruddlesden–Popper series.167,168 This magnetic material crystallizing in a tetragonal structure type has, according to calculations, an indirect band gap of 0.7 eV with very flat bands unsuitable for PV applications.169 However, tin, germanium and copper-based compounds show great promise.
 Fig. 6  Schematic illustration of the loss in dimensionality of the 3D perovskite [MIIX6] octahedra network with the exchange of the monovalent cation (A) with a larger size organic cation (B) fitting into the voids of the octahedral layers. The large monovalent ions A and B are omitted for clarity. 
3.1 Tin- or germanium-based Ruddlesden–Popper phases (A2(GeII,SnII)I4)
The larger organic cations butylammonium (BA) and 2-phenylethylammonium (PEA) are the most popular to form Ruddlesden–Popper phases with tin or germanium. (BA)2SnI4 and (BA)2GeI4 both form single layer thin perovskite sheets of distorted corner-sharing SnI6 or GeI6 in an orthorhombic structure.170 The two-dimensional perovskite (PEA)2GeI4 crystalizes similarly with monolayer-thin perovskite sheets. The direct band gap broadens to 2.12 eV and 2.2 eV with the loss of dimensionality in (PEA)2GeI4 and (PEA)2SnI4, respectively.40,41 With the mixture (PEA)2Ge0.5Sn0.5I4 the BG narrows to 1.95 eV (see Fig. 7d).171 In general, all the tin- and germanium-based 2D perovskites are much more stable compared to their 3D equivalents; especially, the oxidation instability is improved, including higher stability in humid atmospheres.40,170 Moreover, both tin- and germanium-based compounds are thermally stable at temperatures over 200 °C.40,170

Reproduced with permission.171 Copyright 2018, American Chemical Society. 
More narrow BGs are possible with the use of symmetrical imidazolium-based cations such as benzimidazolium (Bn) and benzodiimidazolium (Bdi). These cations allow for the formation of 2D perovskites with optical band gap values of 1.81 eV and 1.79 eV for Bn2SnI4 and BdiSnI4, respectively.322 Even though Bn2SnI4 has a crystal structure with low dimensionality (n = 1), devices with such an absorber layer show a very stable and high PCE at 2.3%.322
Mixing the smaller organic cation methylammonium into the 2D structure increases the dimensionality (see Fig. 6) and, therefore, potentially improves the optoelectronic properties.172 It was found that (BA)2(MA)n−1SnnI3n+1 possesses a BG between 1.5 and 1.42 eV for three or four interconnected octahedral layers in the third dimension (n = 3 or 4). Implemented in PV devices, thin films of (BA)2(MA)3Sn4I13 (n = 4) reach efficiencies of 2.5% with improved moisture stability of unencapsulated devices, showing 90% of the initial PCE after one month and 50% PCE after four months (see Fig. 7).109
Less stable but more efficient devices form with further increased dimensionality. Adding only 20 mol% of the 2D Ruddlesden–Popper phase to FASnI3 ((PEA)2(FA)8Sn9I28) initially improves the device efficiency to around 6%.173 Using only 8 mol% of the 2D phase in the same system further improves the PCE in devices to 9%.324 In these systems, the device performance benefits from the dominant 3D perovskite optoelectronic properties with very low trap-assisted recombination, low shunt losses and more efficient charge collection in combination with much higher stability arising from the 2D Ruddlesden–Popper phase. Unencapsulated devices retain 59% of the original PCE after 76 h exposure to air, while pure 3D absorber layers quickly degrade.324 So far, the substitution with 15 mol% of the 2D material in FASnI3 (PEA0.15FA0.75SnI3) achieves the best results in photovoltaic efficiency with 12.4%. Here, the higher energy level indene-C60 bisadduct as an electron transporting material reduces the carrier recombination significantly and improves VOC to unprecedentedly high values of 0.94 V. Stored under inert conditions, the devices retain 90% of their initial performance for 3800 h, but after 300 min of continuous illumination the PCE drops to 50%.273
With a higher content of the 2D phase with over 66 mol% in PEA2FASn2I7, the devices become more stable with only a drop to 94% of the initial PCE after 700 s continuous solar cell operation under illumination.272 With the incorporation of ethylammonium iodide or chloride, the crystallinity improves in these systems with increased grain size (approximately doubled) and improved crystal alignment in one direction.270,272 Therefore, the device efficiencies rise to over 8% or 9%, respectively.270,272 A similar effect in higher crystallinity and crystal orientation appears with the mixture of BA and PEA in (BA0.5PEA0.5)2FA3Sn4I13 with similar device efficiencies of 8%.267
A stronger bonding of the bulky organic cation to the inorganic octahedra and, therefore, better stability, emerge from the use of cations with diammonium groups resulting in Dion–Jacobson phases. Dion–Jacobson phases are similar to the Ruddlesden–Popper phases. Only in the first compound is the organic cation linked to both sheets of inorganic octahedra. The more stabilized 2D network of the absorber layer results in more stabilized devices with the 4-(aminomethyl) piperidinium (4AMP)(FA)3Sn4I13 absorber resulting in only 9% decay of the initial PCE of 4.22% after continuously operating in an N2 atmosphere.313 Even better results arise with the use of 1,4-butanediamine (BEA) in (BEA)FA2Sn3I10. Here, the 6.43% efficiency retains 90% of its initial value in similar conditions as before for 1000 h and in an ambient atmosphere for 200 h.293
Similarly to most lead-free compounds, device fabrication mainly focused on m-TiO2 or fully organic charge transport layers with PEDOT:PSS as bottom contacts with negligible hysteresis.267,272,273,293,322
3.2 Copper-based Ruddlesden–Popper phases (A2CuIIX4)
The small ionic size of CuII (73 pm) sterically hinders the formation of 3D structures. Instead, a 2D structure forms with monolayered corner-sharing CuX6 octahedra separated by organo-ammonium cations.174–178 These layered structures are stabilized via hydrogen bonding interactions of the ammonium-group with the halides and by van der Waals interactions between the interdigitating organic moieties.175,179 Further stabilization of the layered structure arises from substitution with organic diammonium cations (NH3–R–NH3), similar to tin-based compounds.179 Such flexibility to coordinate with organic cations of various lengths and coordination sites arises from the Jahn–Teller active ion CuII, causing deformation in the copper-halide octahedral framework.180 Therefore, the copper-halide distance adjusts to enable the incorporation of larger cations with four normal bonds and two elongated Cu–X bonds. In the plane of the octahedral network, copper-ions link alternatingly via a bridging halide ion with one elongated and one normal bond.177
In line with many transition metal compounds, all CuII-based compounds are magnetic.177,181,182 Besides, the electronic transitions between the d-orbitals and the ligand-to-metal charge transfer transitions influence the absorption properties.168 Thus, the direct BG of CuII-based compounds varies in a wide range between 2.48 eV for MA2CuCl4 and 1.80 eV for MA2CuCl0.5Br3.5.44 However, the absorption coefficient of the compound with the small organic cation (MA) is quite low and the high effective mass of holes resulting in intrinsic low conductivity limits the prospective PV performance.44,174
In the narrow band gap, bromide-rich compound MA2CuCl0.5Br3.5, anion vacancies acting as electron traps preferably form due to bromide induced partial reduction of CuII to CuI.168 The presence of chloride during crystallization is essential for stability against the reduction of copper.44 However, after synthesis, the pure bromide Ruddlesden–Popper phase (x = 0) of the class of materials MA2CuClxBr4−x appears to be the more environmentally stable combination. Mixtures with chloride decline in their stability compared to MA2CuBr4, which remains stable for seven days in ambient air at 60% relative humidity and exhibits the best thermal stability up to 160 °C.183 Nevertheless, the impact of chloride to avoid reduction reactions during synthesis is essential for the photovoltaic performance. Even though on mesoporous titania the thin film roughness of MA2CuCl4 by far exceeds the better quality thin film morphologies of mixed Cl–Br phases, the PCE with a MA2CuCl4 absorber is superior at 2.41% (see Fig. 8).43
 Fig. 8  (a) Photographs showing the color shift of the material powders with the change of the Cl/I/Br halogen content: (CH3NH3)2CuCl4 (yellow), (CH3NH3)2CuCl2I2 (green), and (CH3NH3)2CuCl2Br2 (dark brown); (b) absorption coefficient; and (c) JV-curves.Reproduced with permission.43 Copyright 2018, American Chemical Society. 
With longer-chain organic cations for the Ruddlesden–Popper phases, the BG size remains largely unaffected at 1.81 eV for (C6H5CH2NH3)2CuBr4.183 In this compound, the exceptionally high absorption coefficient of 105 cm−1 is superior, but in solar cells, the efficiency amounts to only 0.2%.183 With (CH3(CH2)2NH3)2CuBr4, the device efficiency improves to 0.63%, but the devices suffer from intrinsic low conductivity in the absorber layer.174
Other low-dimensional compositions are possible with copper that do not crystallize in the Ruddlesden–Popper phase. The anilinium copper halide C6H4NH2CuBr2I supposedly crystallizes in a hexagonal structure. This compound has a direct band gap of around 1.6 eV and shows substantial hydrophobic behaviour and the thin film deposition is printable, resulting in devices with 0.46% efficiency.184
3.3 Other transition metal-based Ruddlesden–Popper phases (A2MIIX4)
Similar to copper, the small ionic radius of FeII of 78 pm sterically hinders 3D PK formation in MA2FeX4.167 Therefore, the Ruddlesden–Popper phase forms with metal-halogen sheets of corner-sharing FeX6 octahedra.65,168 In (PEA)2FeCl4 the metal-halogen sheets slightly distort due to π–π stacking of benzene rings, resulting in non-2D structures.185
Similar to copper-based phases, mainly studies on the magnetic properties exist of MA2FeCl4, MA2FeCl3Br, MA2FeCl2Br2, (C2H5NH3)2FeCl4, (C3H7NH3)2FeCl4 and (C6H5CH2NH3)2FeCl4.65,186–188 The compounds (CnH2n+1NH3)2MnCl4 and (CnH2n+1NH3)2FeCl4 are antiferromagnetic due to linear super-exchange between two adjacent magnetic ions.189 These magnetic properties provide a platform for applications mainly in memories and spintronics.65,190
The ionic size of palladium suggests, according to the Goldschmidt tolerance factor t = 0.956, the formation of a MAPdCl3 3D PK structure.21 Experimentally, however, a 2D MA2PdCl4 Ruddlesden–Popper phase forms with a direct BG of 2.22 eV and an absorption coefficient of 104 cm−1.42
3.4 Double Ruddlesden–Popper phases (B4MIMIIIX8)
Similar to the 3D perovskite structure, the substitution of two MII cations by the combination of an MI and an MIII cation is possible to form the double Ruddlesden–Popper phase. As with the most common double perovskite combinations including silver bismuth bromide, the long organic cation BA forms the double Ruddlesden–Popper phase (BA)4AgBiBr8. This compound has – in contrast to the double perovskite equivalent – a direct band gap transition, but with a more extensive band gap of 2.77 eV.45,191 In a mixture with cesium in (BA)2CsAgBiBr7 (n = 2 Ruddlesden–Popper phase) the band gap lowers to 2.4 eV.191
Exchanging bromide with iodide and BA with 1,4-cyclohexanediammonium, the 2D (C6H16N2)2AgBiI8·H2O and (C6H16N2)2CuBiI8·0.5H2O compounds form with BGs of 1.93 eV and 1.68 eV, respectively. The compounds are photoresponsive and solution-processable.294 With the cation 5,5′-diylbis(aminoethyl)-[2,2′-bithiophene] [AE2T] in [AE2T]2AgBiI8, the direct BG of the 2D layered structure broadens to 2.0 eV.47 In the bromide-based compound, the 2D crystal structure consists of heavily distorted inorganic sheets with an order-to-disorder transition between 293 and 100 K, which is appealing for possible applications as dielectric switches and sensors.191 Additionally the material shows strong PL signals due to self-trapping of formed excitons.45
More narrow band gap materials form using alkyldiammonium cations with the pure gold-based double Ruddlesden–Popper phases [NH3(CH2)7NH3]2AuIAuIIII6(I2)3 and [NH3(CH2)8NH3]2AuIAuIIII6(I2)3 (containing three times I3− building blocks in the crystal structure from I2 building blocks in the crystal structure from I2 and I−), reaching values of 0.95 eV and 1.14 eV, respectively.46 Similar to germanium- or tin-based Ruddlesden–Popper phases, here the 2D crystal structure consists of metal halide sheets of corner-sharing octahedra separated by organics.46 The hybrid gold-based structures are exceptional with I3− between the inorganic layers parallel to the organic cations. Therefore, the narrower BGs compared to 3D Cs2AuIAuIIII6 can be most likely attributed to the induced electronic interactions between I3− and the gold-iodide perovskite layers.46,326
4. Two- and lower-dimensional perovskite-like defect structures
In lower-dimensional perovskite-like defect structures, we consider mainly perovskite structures missing central metal cations. The newly created voids lead to a separation between the metal-halide octahedral layers and therefore to 1D and 2D structures (see the schematic illustration in Fig. 9). By definition, in the 0D structures, individual octahedra are at a distance from each other.

4.1 Bismuth-based 2D perovskite defect structures (A3BiIII2X9)
Using the trivalent metal cations BiIII and SbIII, the formation of a compound with the formula A3MIII2X9 is possible. Here, two different polymorphs of A3MIII2X9 exist, the zero-dimensional non-perovskite, which we will consider later, and the 2D layered structure vacancy ordered perovskite with n = 2 octahedral layers and MIII vacancies in between (see Fig. 9). Both polymorphs differ significantly with typically direct band gaps for the 2D materials and indirect band gaps for the 0D compounds.
The formation of the 2D polymorph is thermodynamically preferred when either using a small A-cation or small X-anions. Therefore, using potassium, rubidium, or ammonium usually leads to 2D structure formation in bismuth iodide compounds.53,192 The larger size FA, MA and Cs cations mainly crystallize in the bismuth-iodide based 0D polymorph with indirect band gaps of around 2 eV.53,193 With the use of smaller halides like chloride instead of iodide, MA3Bi2Cl9 preferably forms in a 1D structure with zig-zag double chains of distorted [BiCl6]3− octahedra.194 However, partially substituting iodide with the smaller chloride anion stabilizes the 2D structure. Here, exchanging one third with chloride is sufficient to obtain the 2D bilayer trigonal structure of α-Cs3Sb2I9, with Cl occupying the bridging positions of the bilayers and I in the terminal sites.54 The BG in Cs3Bi2I6Cl3 only slightly increases to 2.07 eV, but becomes direct compared to 0D Cs3Bi2I9.54
Using the small ammonium cation in (NH4)3Bi2I9 leads directly to the formation of the 2D polymorph with a direct BG of 2 eV and temperature stability in the range between 120 and 380 K.192 However, the conductivity restricted to the 2D planes hampers the applications of the single crystalline material in PVs.192 Only pellets made from powder show good conductivity of the randomly oriented 2D flakes.192
Another approach to achieve bismuth-iodide based layered structures is to increase the bismuth iodide amount in the ratio, resulting in CsBi3I10. The suggested layered structure resembles BiI3, with alternating dimers similar to the 0D polymorph of Cs3Bi2I9.6,195 Here the direct band gap of 1.77 eV and high absorption coefficients of 1.4 × 105 cm−1, similar to lead-based halide perovskites, appear promising for PV applications.6,195 Photovoltaic devices so far reach only efficiencies of 1.05% but remain stable even after ten days storage in ambient conditions (see Fig. 10).195 Additionally, CsBi3I10 is quite suitable for applications as a red light photodetector.196

4.2 Antimony-based 2D perovskite defect structures (A3SbIII2X9)
Similar to the bismuth analogue, the formation of the 2D antimony-based polymorph strongly depends on the A-cation size. Therefore, 2D structures of A3Sb2I9 form preferably with RbI, KI or (NH4+) serving as the A-cation.48,49 Starting from the larger cation cesium, Cs3Sb2I9 thermodynamically prefers to crystallize as the 0D polymorph. With smaller anions, such as bromide or chloride to substitute iodide, Cs3Sb2I9−xClx stabilizes in the 2D phase.50,197,198 The synthesis of the pure iodide 2D polymorph with cesium as the A-cation requires certain deposition conditions, like exposing Cs3Sb2I9 thin films to SbI3.76,199 The addition of FA in FACs2Sb2I6Cl3 results also in the formation of the 2D phase with a BG reduction from 2.18 eV to 2.0 eV, a similar BG size as the pure iodide compounds.304 The MA cation, with a size similar to cesium, behaves similarly with its thermodynamically preferred 0D defect structure formation. However, either chloride incorporation or an antimony acetate precursor instead of SbI3 can induce the formation of a stable layered phase.52,325
Typically, antimony-based perovskite-like defect structures have direct band gaps of around 2 eV as shown in Fig. 11.48,49,75,325 In direct comparison, layered structures of MA- and Cs-based absorber layers perform better than dimer structures, see Fig. 11c. The highest efficiency of the untreated films is 2.2% with MA3Sb2I9−xClx with a BG of 2.17 eV, using less absorber morphology-sensitive architectures with m-TiO2.52 The addition of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium (LiTFSI) induces intermediate phase formation and high-quality two-dimensional MA3Sb2I9−xClx films form. This slowed crystallization is advantageous for the thin-film morphology, with a more narrow BG of 2.05 eV and an improved PCE of 3.34% in devices.280

Since the 2D material tends to be p-type conducting, efficient devices with Cs3Sb2I9−xClx without an HTM on TiO2 are possible with a PCE of 1.2%.50 For morphology-sensitive planar devices using PEDOT:PSS as the bottom interphase, the application of a pure iodide absorber improved the PCE to 1.5%.199 In devices, mainly the photocurrent is limited due to a combination of high exciton binding energy, large effective masses and significant structural disorder leading to deep traps.49,200 However, the comparison of (NH4)3Sb2I9 single crystals with thin films shows that the hole mobility and electron mobility are higher in single crystals by a factor of 105, indicating enormous potential for the improvement of devices.48
The 2D phase of the A3Sb2I9 polymorph, as well as the resulting devices, are very stable against high temperature and humidity.50,325 Especially, devices of the cesium-based compounds retain 95% of the initial PCE after up to 60 days in ambient conditions with 50% humidity without encapsulation and are stable at high temperatures up to 400 °C.50 Additionally, although Cs3Sb2I9 is affected by water, light and elevated temperatures, the 2D polymorph remains twice as stable as the 0D phase.278 Devices containing hybrid MA3Sb2I9−xClx treated with LiTFSI retain 90% of the initial PCE after 1400 h storage in ambient conditions with 30% relative humidity of unencapsulated devices or after exposure for 400 h to indoor light.280 All photovoltaic devices based on A3Sb2X9 compounds show no notable hysteresis with the usual architectures consisting of m-TiO2 or PEDOT:PSS as bottom contacts.50,52,199,280
The 2D phases obtained with the smaller-size anions bromide or chloride have wide band gaps of around 2.6–3.0 eV in the bulk. The optical absorption is unsuitable for applications in PVs but interesting for blue LED applications, for example with Cs3Sb2Br9 QDs or Cs3Sb2Cl9 thin films.197,198 The QDs emit at 410 nm with a PLQE of 46%, which is superior to reported untreated QDs of the CsPbCl3 equivalent, especially since the QDs are stable in air for 35 days with 70% of the original PLQE, and after 108 h under UV irradiation the PLQE only drops by 50%.197,201
The band gap of Cs3Sb2Cl9 is tunable through the insertion of additional metal-halide octahedra into the structure. Such an insertion requires a divalent central metal ion with similar ionic radius to antimony. For example, CuCl2 and additional CsCl can be jointly inserted in between the n = 2 octahedral layers of Cs3Sb2Cl9, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 9. The new compound has the formula Cs4CuSb2Cl12 (1 in Fig. 11d) with a layered structure equivalent to an n = 3 2D perovskite vacancy ordered structure with a symmetric monoclinic structure.56 The structure consists of mainly distorted CuCl6 and SbCl6 octahedra, mostly due to Jahn Teller distorted axial Cu–Cl bonds.56 Due to the copper incorporation, the direct BG lowers to 1.0 eV, as shown in Fig. 11d. The resulting material is highly stable to UV light exposure and 50% relative humidity for over 100 days and is stable at high temperatures of up to 210 °C. At higher temperatures the product reversibly converts to Cs3Sb2Cl9 and Cs2CuCl4.56,202 Most impressively, pressed pellets of Cs4CuSb2Cl12 powder show conductivity one order of magnitude larger than MAPbI3.56 However, the insolubility of the compound in most polar solvents makes film preparation most challenging. So far, only reports on the synthesis of crystalline powder from precipitation in HCl or from grinding exist.56,202–204
The magnetic response of CuII d9 electrons in Cs4CuSb2Cl12 controls its optoelectronic properties.202 Additionally, the theoretically calculated discrepancy of the hole/electron effective masses with very high numbers for the electrons leads to doubts if the material is suitable for PV applications.205 Results from single-layered Cs4CuSb2Cl12 nanocrystals provide indications of tunability of the optoelectronic properties. This material exhibits a narrow band gap of 1.6 eV with an indirect-to-direct BG transition and a reduced electron effective mass.204 Further evidence of the adaptability of the material properties emerges from substituting copper with manganese. With the general formula Cs4Mn1−xCuxSb2Cl12 the BG changes from 3.0 to 1.0 eV with increasing value for x, hence actively modifying the magnetic behaviour and the electronic structure.57 Additionally, copper substitution with silver in Cs4CuxAg2−2xSb2Cl12 NCs broadens the BG from 1.79 eV to 3.04 eV due to the change in crystal structure resulting from the monovalent silver central metal cation.288
The substitution of copper with germanium in FA4GeSb2Cl12 increases the solubility in polar solvents. Thus, this new composition enables thin film fabrication of the structure with a direct BG of 1.3 eV. This compound also features conductivities one order of magnitude higher than that of MAPbI3, combined with stability at high temperature, light and moisture. Even though the absorber morphology consists of tiny grains, devices using mesoporous TiO2 reach a PCE of 4.7%, see Fig. 11e.58
Avoiding the challenges of thin film formation of Cs4CuSb2Cl12 by inserting the compound into a carbon matrix, it is feasible to successfully apply the material in photodetectors.203
4.3 One-dimensional structures
One-dimensional structures of octahedral chains with promising optoelectronic properties for PV applications exist for tin-, manganese- and bismuth-based compounds. Unlike the higher dimensional SnII compounds, the 1D hybrid tin iodide using the long organic cation 1,8-octyldiammonium (DAO) remains exceptionally stable in water for more than 15 h or after 90 days of exposure to air. Additionally, the material exhibits promising optoelectronic properties with a PL signal at 634 nm and a PLQE of 36%.312
The material (pyrrolidinium)MnIICl3 exhibits promising ferroelectric features with a saturation polarization of up to 6.2 μC cm−2 and intensive red PL with a PLQY of 56%.206,207 In the case of bismuth, the compound (C6H13N)2BiI5 with a tetramethylpiperidinium cation has a direct BG of 2.02 eV combined with high moisture stability, long PL lifetime and high photoconductivity.59 However, the large insulating organic cations limit the transport to two dimensions, limiting possible PV applications.
4.4 Zero-dimensional perovskite-defect structures (A2MIVX6)
As 0D perovskite-defect structures, we mainly consider the K2PtIVCl6 structure type.208 Here, octahedra of tetravalent metals and halides are isolated in coordination similar to a perovskite structure but containing octahedral voids in each neighbouring position (see Fig. 12). All 0D perovskite-defect structures of A2MIVX6 regardless of the nature of the MIV central ion exhibit defect tolerance.
 Fig. 12  Schematic illustration of the 0D perovskite-defect structure derived from the 3D perovskite structure. Octahedra in grey visualize the voids in the structure. 
TinIV belongs to the most commonly studied central metal ions for this group of materials, especially the stable purely inorganic molecular salt A2SnI6 (A = Rb, Cs).60,62,209 This material is intrinsically n-type conductive or becomes p-type conductive with SnII doping. However, the obtained electron mobilities remain one order of magnitude higher than the hole mobilities (μe = 310 cm2 V s−1, μh = 42 cm2 V s−1).209 These intrinsic properties derive from the strong covalency in SnI6, leading to iodine vacancies and interstitial tin as dominant defects.210 However, the short bond distances in tin-iodide benefit its stability in an ambient environment.208 Combining the material's stability and its optoelectronic properties with direct BGs between 1.25 and 1.62 eV, Cs2SnI6 shows excellent promise for PV applications.208–211
Acting as an HTM in DSSCs, Cs2SnI6-based devices reach efficiencies close to 8%.209 As an absorber layer, pure iodide compounds provide PV device efficiencies of just about 1%.212,213 Here, in addition to poor hole-conductivity in Cs2SnI6, the quality of the thin film morphology is crucial for the device performance. Cs2SnI6 is hardly soluble in polar solvents and the rapid crystallization of CsI impedes the fabrication of compact layers.211
Exchanging iodide with bromide or chloride widens the direct BG.62 Unexpectedly, the change in the BG is not linear with the halide concentration in Cs2SnI6−xBrx, see Fig. 13a.61,214 So far devices using Cs2SnI4Br2 as the absorber with a band gap of 1.4 eV perform best with a PCE of 2%, see Fig. 13b.61 In the iodide and chloride mixtures (Cs2SnI6−xClx), the PL is more intense compared to pure iodide or chloride compounds.286 However, the exact halide ratio is crucial for the stability of the material with decreasing thermal stability but increasing stability in water of Cs2SnI6−xClx mixtures with increasing chloride content.283,286

The germanium-based equivalents Cs2GeCl2I4, Cs2GeBr2I4 and Cs2GeI2Br4 also appear to be promising direct BG semiconductors with their predicted electronic structure and optical absorption.215 However, no experimental evidence confirms their feasibility.
Using transition metals like titanium in Cs2TiBr6 reveals a similar defect tolerance to Cs2SnI6.214 The BG becomes indirect with a 1.7–1.8 eV width, but a direct band gap transition is very close at around 1.9 eV (see Fig. 13c).63,216 The quasi-direct band gap shows excellent optical absorption, which leads to efficiencies of 3.3% with no hysteresis in photovoltaic devices (see Fig. 13d).63 Unfortunately, indications of low stability of Cs2TiBr6 powder in an ambient atmosphere hamper its suitability for PV applications.217
Similar to titanium, the palladium equivalent Cs2PdBr6 with an indirect BG of 1.6 eV has long-lived PL, dispersive electronic bands, and outstanding stability towards illumination, humidity and heat.64,65 The synthesis of hybrid MA2PdCl4 is also possible with a direct BG of 2.22 eV.42
More narrow direct band gaps supposedly form with telluride as a central metal ion in A2TeI6 (A = K, Rb, Cs, Tl) with calculated values between 1.38 and 1.52 eV and strong optical absorption.208,218,296 Synthesized Cs2TeI6 has an optical band gap of 1.5 eV, absorption coefficients of 6 × 104 cm−1, p-type conductivity and thermal stability up to 250 °C.309 The mixture of tin and telluride in Cs2Sn1−xTexCl6 leads to a potential emitter with high water stability, PL at 580 nm and a high PLQY of 95.4%.289 However, telluride compounds are usually highly toxic.219,220
Not only MIV elements but also the MIII element antimony can form zero-dimensional perovskite-like structures. With the sizeable organic cation N-aminopropylmorpholinium, two heteromorphic hybrids form. (C7H18N2O)3Sb4I18·H2O and (C7H18N2O)Sb2I8·H2O exist with zero-dimensional perovskite-like structure, exhibiting indirect BGs of 1.71 eV and 2.11 eV, respectively.221 Mixing SbIII and BiIII, a 0D mixed metal halide perovskite with the N,N-dimethylanilinium cation forms with the composition (C8H12N)4Bi0.57Sb0.43Br7·H2O. Here, the individual [BiBr6]3− and [SbBr6]3− octahedral units are entirely isolated and surrounded by the large organic cation C8H12N+. The bulk crystals exhibit ultra-broadband emission ranging from 400 to 850 nm (originating from both free excitons and self-trapped excitons) and are stable against light and humidity.222
Antimony-based 0D perovskite like-compounds also exist in a higher oxidation state. Both (C2H5)4NSbVBr6 and (N-ethylpyridinium)SbVBr6 consist of slightly disordered and isolated SbBr6 octahedra.223,224 (C2H5)4NSbVBr6 is a dark red-brown compound, but its application in PVs as an absorber is failing due to its very low solubility in polar solvents.223 Additionally, the bromide interionic distances of separated octahedra are too large for interspecies charge transfer. The shorter bromide interionic distances of neighbouring octahedra in (N-ethylpyridinium)SbVBr6 and the processability of the material from solution may make it more suitable for PV applications. With a BG of 1.65 eV, solar cells achieve an astonishing open-circuit voltage of 1.285 V, but the PCE does not exceed 3.8% yet.224
4.5 Double zero-dimensional perovskite-defect structures (A4MIIIMVX12)
Tuning the 0D perovskite-defect structure further, the exchange of the MIV-ion with MIII- and MV-ions results in a double structure. The pure antimony compound with the general formula A4SbIIISbVX12 is the most commonly known structure of isolated octahedra with mixed-valence metal central ions, first reported in 1964.66,225–229 The absorption in this class of materials arises from the charge transfer band from populated 5s states of SbIII and empty 5s states of SbV, likely mediated by halide ligands.66 In the chloride-based material, this gives a deep blue-purple colouration, and deep black colour in the bromide-based material.66,229 Smaller halogens in the structure entail a depression of the ionization potential and widening of the BG due to the halide p-orbitals that dominate the VB maximum. The central metal ion interactions with the halide ligands dictate the energy and dispersion of the CB, influencing the nature of the band gap and defect chemistry. Strongly covalent interactions between antimony and the halides move the CB minimum to higher energies. Thus, the A-site cation does not directly participate in charge transport or the absorption process but instead influences the surrounding octahedral framework.
With tin substituting antimony, the intensity of the charge transfer band sharply decreases. However, with higher tin concentration the electrical conductivity is reduced, due to the discontinuity of the Sb sublattice, through which mobile holes travel via thermally activated hopping.226,227 Other possible elemental combinations use indium or bismuth as MIII ions with cubic or tetragonal structures, respectively.225
5. Non-perovskite-like absorber compounds
Despite the popularity of perovskite structures for PV absorber layer materials inspired by the superior lead-based compounds, non-perovskite structured materials may also be highly promising. These non-perovskite-like materials mainly consist of either antimony or bismuth central MIII-ions. In this review, we focus only on the solution-processable compositions. Therefore, the systems show prospects for implementation in device architectures similar to the lead-based model compounds.
5.1 Antimony- or bismuth-based rudorffites (MIaMIIIbXa+3b)
The name rudorffites arises from the prototype NaVO2, as shown in Fig. 14a. Different to the corner-sharing octahedra in the perovskite structure, the rudorffite structure contains edge-sharing [MIX6] and [MIIIX6] octahedra as schematically shown in Fig. 14a.68 Here, the polyhedral structure contains silver, copper or sodium for MI ions in combination with antimony or bismuth as MIII ions.68,230,231 Using iodide as the halide, the ratio of AgI to BiI3 defines the crystal structure and band gap.231 In the combinations Ag3BiI6, Ag2BiI5, AgBiI4 and AgBi2I7, the first two have trigonal structures while the last two crystallize in cubic structures.231 However, all the compounds resemble in their crystal structure the NaVO2 prototype with metal vacancies caused by either Ag-deficiency in bismuth-rich or Bi-deficiency in Ag-rich compounds.68,230 The resulting direct band gaps of the four combinations range from 1.79 to 1.83 eV, suitable for PV applications, see Fig. 15a.68 Additionally, all combinations are stable towards exposure to light in working devices, 50% relative humidity over a month and temperatures of up to 100 °C.230,232,233

Devices with rudorffite absorber layers so far work best using mesoporous titania frameworks as substrate surfaces. With the Ag3BiI6 combination, the devices reach efficiencies of 4.3%.68 However, with two wt% LiTFSI added to the precursor solution for AgBiI4 thin films, the surface coverage improves, leading to 2.5% device efficiencies in planar SnO2-based architectures.234 In a direct comparison of AgBiI4 and Ag2BiI5 in an m-TiO2 device architecture, the efficiencies improve from 2.2% to 2.5%, respectively, indicating the improved potential of higher silver iodide ratios and importance of grain size due to double-size grains for Ag2BiI5 (see Fig. 15).235 Furthermore, Ag2BiI5 shows potential for applications in near-infrared (NIR)-blind visible light photodetection since the compound exhibits excellent spectral rejection of NIR wavelengths.236
The substitution of a small fraction of I− with S2− induces notable contractions of the band gaps and upshifts of the valence band edges in the rudorffites. With only small amounts of sulphide in the family of Ag3BiI6−2xSx, solar cell PCEs improve from 4.3% to 5.4% upon changing x from 0 to 4 at% (see Fig. 15).69 Ag3BiI5.92S0.04-based devices also exhibit excellent long-term stability and retain more than 90% of their initial efficiency after 45 days of storage under ambient conditions.69 Pure sulphides, however, with AgBiS2-NPs in sensitized solar cells only reach PCEs of 0.53%.237
Using copper as the MI metal ion in CuBiI4 leads to a cubic structure of edge-connected octahedra.238 In crystalline thin films with (222) orientation, the n-type semiconductor has a BG of 1.81 eV. If applied in ETM-free devices on top of ITO, the CuBiI4-based devices reach a PCE of 1.1%.239 The band gap of copper antimony iodide rudorffite with the formula Cu3SbI6 is, on the other hand, indirect and broad with a 2.43 eV width, limiting the power conversion efficiency in devices to 0.50%.240
Pure sulphide antimony rudorffites appear to be more promising PV candidates. NaSbS2, for example, crystallizes in a monoclinic structure with a direct BG of 1.7 eV.74,241,242 NPs of this compound act as a p-type semiconductor and deposited on m-TiO2 devices achieve a PCE of 2.3% with a superior EQE of 82%.74 Exchanging the MI cation with copper in CuSbS2, the direct BG reduces to 1.5 eV. Nevertheless, p-type conductivity remains, which is why the first studies concentrated on simulations as HTMs of the compound in lead-based perovskite solar cells.73,243 The 3D orthorhombic structure consists of SbS5 square pyramids and CuS4 tetrahedra.244 Applied on top of mesoporous TiO2, the PV devices exhibit superior current densities of 21.5 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 3.1%.73 The CuS rich Cu3SbS4 crystallizes in a tetragonal structure with similarly sized [CuS4] and [SbS4] polyhedra. In the structure antimony acts as the center atom surrounded by four copper-sulphide tetrahedra, thus forming a 2D network.245 Nanocrystals of this compound applied as HTMs in PSCs reach a PCE of 8.7%, improving the initial device stability.246
A majority of the devices with rudorffite-based absorber layers consist of the less morphology-sensitive m-TiO2 bottom layer with typically low hysteresis.
5.2 Antimony- or bismuth-based chalcogenide halides (MIIIChX)
Using only one central metal ion such as antimony or bismuth in combination with a mixed chalcogenide halide provides access to compositions with lower-dimensional structures than the rudorffites. Theoretical studies on the electronic structures of SbSI, SbSBr, and SbSeI predict direct BGs between 1.7 and 2.2 eV and electron and hole-effective masses below 0.65 me.247 With a static dielectric constant of 70, the compounds show a tendency for spontaneous polarisation.247
Experimentally, SbSI forms pseudo-1D channels in the orthorhombic phase with a direct BG of 2.15 eV, high photoconductivity, ferroelectricity, and piezoelectricity.71 With small-size grains and not complete coverage on top of m-TiO2 devices this absorber still reaches photovoltaic efficiencies of 3.05%.71 Partially substituting antimony with bismuth lowers the BG to 1.62 eV in the composition Sb0.67Bi0.33SI.70 As a result, in the same device architecture with similar morphology the PCE increases to 4.07% with a nearly doubled current density of 14.4 mA cm−2.70 Furthermore, the devices show excellent stability, retaining 93% of the initial PCE after illumination for 1254 min of unencapsulated cells at 85 °C in air with a relative humidity below 40%.70
The pure bismuth-based compound BiOI crystallizes in a tetragonal 2D structure.248 Computations predict tolerance of BiOI towards vacancy and antisite defects with low formation energy and a high dielectric constant.72 Thin films grown by chemical vapour transport maintain phase stability for at least 197 d and achieve a PCE of 1.8% in devices with no hysteresis, with NiOx as the bottom contact.72
5.3 Bismuth-based low-dimensional compounds
The most investigated bismuth-based low-dimensional compounds have the general formula A3Bi2I9 (A = FA+, MA+, Cs+, or Rb+). In the 0D polymorph, the BG is not as strongly influenced by the type of A-site cation as in the 2D phase.249 The indirect band gap ranges from 2.1 eV to 2.3 eV.78,79
DFT calculations of Cs3Bi2I9 and MA3Bi2I9 predict a relatively localized VBM and CBM due to the isolated dimers of the 0D phase. Therefore, the carrier effective masses are substantial for both electrons and holes.250,251 Additionally, the exciton binding energy for Cs3Bi2I9 is as high as 300 meV,252 which is much higher than the 180 meV of the 2D layered BiI3 with a band gap of 2 eV.253 Another critical aspect regarding the 0D polymorph of the material is that most of the defects in Cs3Bi2I9 generate deep level states in the band gap.250 However, the absorber is very stable at high temperatures and humidity. MA3Bi2I9-based devices remain stable over 40 days at a humidity level over 50%.79,254–256 When the material decomposes, Bi2O3, BiOI or BiI3 form.257 In thermogravimetric measurements (TGA), the initial mass loss occurs between 250 and 350 °C due to sublimation of BiI3, indicating much higher stability against decomposition compared to MAPbI3.257
In direct comparison, the Cs3Bi2I9 absorber performs better than MA3Bi2I9 in devices.80,258 The grain size in the all-inorganic compound tends to grow slightly more extensive than in the hybrid material.258 However, the morphology strongly depends on the nature of the substrate.255 Surprisingly, the best results in PV applications were achieved with thin film absorbers with small-size grains or with ultrathin plates and preferred crystal alignment in the (101) direction and uniform surface coverage.80,256 The devices reach efficiencies of up to 3.17% for the MA3Bi2I9 absorber and 3.2% for the Cs3Bi2I9 absorber (see Fig. 16).80,256 The hybrid FA3Bi2I9, on the other hand, shows low potential for solar cell applications with a BG of 2.19 eV, exciton binding energy as high as 260 meV and highest achieved PCE of 0.022% so far.259

The treatment of Cs3Bi2I9 with the alkali metal sulfide Na2S decreases the optical BG from 2.3 eV to 1.5 eV due to partial formation of the 3D double PK Cs2NaBiI6 and the divalent sulfide ions occupying the interstitial sites.302 Pure Cs2NaBiI6 has a band gap of 1.66 eV and exhibits high stability against moisture and oxygen in ambient air, but solar cells reach efficiencies of only 0.42% so far.307
Similar narrowing of the BG occurs for MA3Bi2I9 thin films starting from bismuth ethyl xanthate precursor Bi(CH3CH2OCS2)3 (also Bi(xt)3) with high potential as an absorber material. The compound undergoes a colour change from yellow to black when annealed from 80 °C to 150 °C, correlating with a BG change from 2.1 eV to 1.45 eV (see Fig. 16b). No structural change or incorporation of sulfur is evident since in the XRD analysis neither any additional peak nor any peak shift occurs with increasing annealing temperature. The black thin films additionally exhibit increased charge carrier concentration and mobility compared to the original p-type semiconductor.260
In other optoelectronic applications, Cs3Bi2X9, FA3Bi2X9 and MA3Bi2X9 NCs also have high potential. The NCs are stable in ambient conditions for over 30 days.261,291 The emission wavelengths vary between 360 nm and 560 nm depending on the organic cation and halide composition, with an increasing redshift for anions in the sequence chloride, bromide and iodide.261–263 The PLQE of Cs3Bi2X9 QDs reaches up to 62% for chloride, 22% for bromide, and 2.3% for iodide-based systems.263
In addition to 0D non-perovskite-like compounds, related 1D bismuth-based compounds exist with exciting properties for PV applications. For example, (C6H5NH3)BiI4 forms a structure with 1D edge-sharing chains. The BG of 2.14 eV is direct and the material is stable up to 184 °C and can tolerate continuous moisture exposure for 334 days in ambient air, apparently owing to the presence of hydrophobic organic moieties. The excellent solubility in ethanol and superior dense and pinhole-free film formation even on 20 cm2 substrates indicate potential for thin film solar cells or LEDs.264,291 Nanocrystals of 0D Rb7Bi3Cl16 also present blue emission at 437 nm with good optical and moisture stability for one month.287
Narrowing the BG further with the organic cation 1,6-hexanediammonium (HDA) in HDABiI5 to 2.0 eV (indirect band gap), an orthorhombic 1D zig-zag chain structure forms. However, so far, the absorber only reached an efficiency of 0.027% in PV devices.265
5.4 Antimony-based low-dimensional compounds
The 2D and 0D (‘dimer’) polymorphs of A3M2X9 show a rather low lattice energy barrier between each other, and hence both can be synthesized by using different preparation methods, A-site cations or halogens.
In the compounds Cs3Sb2I9 and MA3Sb2I9, the 0D phase is the thermodynamically preferred phase with an indirect band gap of around 1.95 eV.75
The crystallization of the dimer phase with the presence of HI ensures a stoichiometric amount of iodide in the structure and improves the thin film coverage (see Fig. 17a and b).75 With a hydrophobic interlayer as the substrate surface for dimer film growth, the presence of HI additionally promotes layer morphologies with larger grain sizes and preferential crystal alignment in one direction.77 The larger grains show a positive impact on the charge transport properties and surface trap states, resulting in devices with the highest reported PCE of 2.8% for this material class, as shown in Fig. 17.77 In particular, MA3Sb2I9 as the absorber layer composition shows the highest potential with the highest device efficiencies in direct comparison with the purely inorganic Cs3Sb2I9.75

Other 0D structures, starting from SbIII, form with the organic cations tetraethylammonium (TEA) and benzyltriethyl-ammonium (TEBA) in (TEA)2SbCl5 or (TEBA)2SbCl5. Here, isolated [SbCl5]2− pyramids are separated by nearly 10 Å. These compounds show promise with their light emission over a broad spectral range and PLQE near unity for single component white light emitters.266
6. Conclusion
In this review, we discuss the latest developments in research on lead-free perovskite-inspired compounds. Diverse compositions and structures exist, implementing the central metal ions SnII–IV, GeII–IV, BiIII–V, SbIII–V, CuII or TiIV, which have already found applications in diverse thin film optoelectronic devices (see also Fig. 1d). The materials either crystallize in perovskite-related structures with corner-sharing octahedral alignment with varying structural dimensionality or crystallize in related non-perovskite structures with bismuth or antimony central cations. Many more compositions continue to emerge, including transition metals such as gold, palladium, etc. with promising band gap energies. Unfortunately, synthetic challenges such as creating high-quality thin films so far hamper the PV applications of most lead-free absorbers. Thus, much work remains to be done in order to assess the full potential of this wide range of lead-free materials.
Among the compounds discussed here, the tin-based structures with various dimensionalities have been most intensely investigated and tin-based halide perovskite solar cells now reach efficiencies of up to 13%. However, the environmental instability of the perovskite with the best optoelectronic properties and the toxicity of tin are significant challenges regarding commercial applications. On the other hand, bismuth- and antimony-based compounds are often environmentally stable and of less concern regarding toxicity, offering an impressive structural and compositional variety as well as tunable band gaps.
Similar to lead-based compounds, hybrid lead-free compositions with organic cations often allow for more facile processing of high-quality layers with resulting higher device efficiencies than their inorganic equivalents. However, the purely inorganic phases often show better phase stability. In lead-based PVs, the organic cation part (MA or FA) is believed to be responsible for the poor thermal and environmental stability of these materials.311 Therefore, more effort should be focused on investigating the stability of hybrid compounds in direct comparison with equally crystalline inorganic phases.
So far, most of the above absorber materials and thin film designs are at the stage of fundamental studies and early development. The main focus is on understanding the materials’ physical properties including optical absorption, charge carrier mobilities and effective masses, defect physics, etc. Notably, the synthesis of a large number of these compounds at high quality and with controlled defect population is quite challenging in general and needs to be addressed to move forward toward practical photovoltaic applications of lead-free perovskite-inspired compounds.

Broader context
Renewable energy sources are required to cover the ever-growing energy demands of the world. Among renewable energy sources, sunlight belongs to the most abundant and easily accessible. In the last decade, a new solution-processable photovoltaic system emerged with hybrid halide lead perovskites serving as absorber layers. Thus, the field of very cost-effective and highly efficient photovoltaic technology advanced, enabling the design of versatile device configurations. For example, the fabrication of tandem devices becomes more facile with the upper cells made of perovskite-based devices requiring low temperatures for manufacturing using solution-based processes. However, perovskite-based technologies suffer from low stability against moisture and high temperatures, limiting their longevity. Besides, the toxicity of soluble lead salts is a concern, especially considering large-scale deployment. Therefore, lead-free perovskite and perovskite-inspired absorber layers have recently come into research focus. Typically, the central metal lead is replaced by other less toxic metal ions while retaining octahedral coordination with the halide ions. Our review discusses the various new structural combinations that have emerged for lead-free absorber layers, including the synthesis, physical properties and advantages and challenges with a view to photovoltaic applications.
