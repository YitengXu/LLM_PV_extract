    , Accepted 4th November 2016First published on 7th November 2016AbstractThe present study investigates the effect of gradient doping on modifying the photoelectrochemical response of Ti-doped Fe2O3 photoanodes for their use in sunlight based water splitting for hydrogen evolution. The deposition of a thin film over the ITO (tin doped indium oxide) substrate was carried out using a spray pyrolysis method. The concentration of dopant was varied from 0.5–8.0 at% and two sets of samples were also prepared with low to high (0.5–8%) and high to low (8–0.5%) dopant concentrations in the direction towards the substrate. The prepared thin films were characterized using X-ray Diffractometry (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) Spectroscopy, Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (SIMS), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and UV-visible Spectroscopy. The photoelectrochemical studies revealed that the deposition of dopant layers with a low to high concentration towards the substrate exhibited a highly improved photoresponse (200 times) in comparison to the pristine sample and a two fold enhancement in comparison to 2% Ti-doped Fe2O3. The improvement in the photoresponse has been attributed to the values of a high flat band potential, low resistance, high open circuit voltage, carrier separation efficiency, applied bias photon-to-current conversion efficiency (ABPE), and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE). A reduced charge transfer resistance has been demonstrated with Nyquist plots.
1. Introduction
It is a formidable task for mankind to meet the future energy demands with depleting petroleum based fuels and, on the other hand, to generate a renewable transportation fuel using the immense power of the Sun.1 Hydrogen is considered as one of the best alternative clean energy sources for the future generation, but major hydrogen production technologies are associated with CO2 emission. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting is regarded as an efficient and one-step process for splitting water into H2 and O2 using solar energy with the use of a semiconductor material. The semiconductor material must fulfill two fundamental requirements i.e. it should have a catalytic function for splitting water into H2 and O2 and it should be able to absorb a maximum amount of energy from sunlight.2,3 Other requirements, which must be fulfilled with the semiconductor material, include effective separation and transportation of charge carriers to avoid recombination, straddling band edge positions, a cost effective and non-corrosive material, and stability in an aqueous medium. Various modification strategies like doping,4 co-doping,5 dye sensitization,6 swift heavy ion irradiation,7 and forming nanocomposites8 and heterojunctions9 have been tried over a period of time to develop a suitable semiconductor for PEC application. There are a variety of both oxide and non-oxide semiconductor materials available for PEC water splitting, some absorb light in the ultra-violet range (large band gap) while some absorb in the visible range (small band gap). Large band gap semiconductors mainly include ZnO, TiO2, SrTiO3, BaTiO3, and WO3 and the small band gap materials include Fe2O3, Cu2O, CdSe, CdTe, GaAs, TaON, Ta3N5, and BiVO4. However, large band gap materials are of limited use as they absorbs the UV portion of sunlight which constitutes only a small portion of the solar spectrum, while some small band gap materials have stability issues.10,11 It can be said that development of a suitable semiconductor for commercial application is still a big challenge for the scientific community.
Fe2O3 is one of the promising materials that has been studied over the last forty years on account of it being very abundant, cheap, stable in an aqueous system, and visible light absorbing (band gap lies between 1.9–2.2 eV). Major issues which restrict its performance in PEC applications include a short diffusion length of the photogenerated holes, slow kinetics of water oxidation which in turn leads to the external bias requirement for water oxidation, a low absorption coefficient and the position of the conduction band edge below the H+/H2 reduction potential.12,13 Among the other modification strategies adopted for improving its PEC performance, doping is considered as one of the potent ways to introduce impurities and thus to improve its carrier concentration and conductivity, which in turn increase the photoelectrochemical performance of doped semiconductors.11 Many dopants like Si,14 Ce, W, V, Sn,15,16 Mo, Cr,17 Pt,18 Al,19 Zr,20 Cu, Zn,21–23 and Ti24–31 have been tried by various researchers to improve the photoresponse of this fascinating material. Lian et al. prepared Ti-doped Fe2O3 on a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate and reported 23% IPCE at 400 nm at 0.3 V vs. AgCl in a 1 M NaOH solution and Zhang et al. adopted an atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) method to deposit Ti-Fe2O3 photoanodes and reported 27.2% IPCE at 400 nm at an applied bias of 0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl.24,25 Surface modification of Ti-doped hematite films through the loading of materials viz. FeOOH, Ni(OH)2 and CoF3 has also been undertaken by researchers to enhance the performance.26,28,29
Bilayered (heterojunction) photosystems are known to possess improved band bending in comparison to single layer systems and thus better charge separation. However, there is a possibility of creation of interfacial defects during the synthesis, which may act as charge recombination centres. Also it is difficult to find materials with suitable band edge positions and to synthesize a clean heterostructure. Through creating n–n+ homojunctions, band bending can be extended to the bulk of the sample.32,33 Gradient doping, a relatively new technique, has been investigated recently for effective separation of charge carriers and to improve the properties of the materials in terms of hydrogen generation via a PEC route. Abdi et al. made an attempt to create a homojunction and additional band bending using gradient doping (ten step gradient) with a tungsten (W) dopant in spray pyrolytically deposited BiVO4 to improve the charge carrier separation efficiency.32 Wang et al. have used ion implantation to introduce a varied distribution of N dopants within a ZnO nanorod array (NRA), and they found that with N ions implanted in the ZnO NRAs with a gradient dopant concentration of N, the material exhibited a good photoelectrochemical performance under visible light illumination and the increment in the photoresponse was attributed to improved charge carrier separation.33
Here we report the effect of gradient doping using Ti-doped hematite photoanodes. It is well known that doping will introduce impurity levels within the band gap of the semiconductor material and a gradient concentration of Ti (with increasing and decreasing concentrations) would create steep band bending across the film due to a shift in the Fermi level. The photoelectrochemical response of the gradient doping samples is compared with an undoped sample and single dopant concentration samples.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) and titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Ultra pure distilled water was used for making the precursor solution. Tin doped indium oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were obtained from SPI supplies, USA.
2.2. Fabrication of photoanodes
The thin films of hematite were deposited using a spray pyrolysis method and the method of preparation was adopted from elsewhere.25,28 A calculated amount of Ti dopant was added into the precursor 0.15 M Fe(NO3)3·9H2O solution and five different atomic percent dopant concentrations of Ti were used viz. 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 4% and 8%. The atomised spray solution was applied at a pressure of 2 psi with a flow rate of 500 μL min−1. Prior to the deposition, the ITO coated glass substrates were kept on a hot plate maintained at a temperature of 400 ± 10 °C. The total spray duration was 100 s (20 s for each deposition). The two gradient doped samples viz. low to high (0.5–8%) and high to low (8–0.5%) in the direction towards the ITO substrate were prepared by spraying each dopant layer for 20 s with a time interval of 30 min between each spray to avoid mixing of the layers. Finally the film was covered with an epoxy-resin (Hysol, Singapore) and hollow glass was attached on top to make a sturdy electrode for PEC study.
A schematic representation of the details for the various samples prepared is shown in Fig. 1.

2.3. Characterization

2.3.1. Physical characterization. 
Structural analysis of the prepared samples was performed with a Bruker AXS D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα source (λ = 1.5406 Å) and at incidence angle of 2 degrees. The films were scanned with 2θ values of 20–60° and a scan speed of 2 s step−1. The Debye Scherrer formula mentioned in eqn (1) was used to calculate the average particle size (t) of the samples.34,35 t = 0.9λ/βcosθ(1)where λ is X-ray wavelength, β is the full width at half maximum and θ is the Bragg diffraction angle.
Optical absorption spectra were obtained for the visible range (400–800 nm) using a double beam UV-visible Spectrophotometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu, Japan). The absorbance spectrum was utilized to obtain Tauc plots to evaluate the changes in the band gap after doping. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was used to obtain SEM images to observe changes in the surface morphology and for this a TESCAN MIRA II LMH system was used. The elemental composition was confirmed with an EDX (Oxford INCA PentaFETx3) spectrometer.
To study the electronic structure, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed with an Omicron ESCA (Oxford Instrument, Germany) with an Al anode of energy 1486.7 eV. Depth profile measurement was performed using SIMS (Hiden Analytical SIMS Workstation). O2+ with 5 keV of energy was used as the primary source with a 400 nA beam current.

2.4. Photoelectrochemical characterization
A three electrode set up was used for the photoelectrochemical analysis, consisting of a Pt counter electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode and a hematite working electrode as the photoanode. The three electrodes were immersed in 0.1 M NaOH (pH 13) electrolyte solution in a quartz cell. Electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Germany) was employed for recording current vs. potential plots under both dark and illumination conditions with a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 in a scan range of 1 V/SCE to −1 V/SCE. Illumination was performed using a 150 W Xenon Arc Lamp (illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2; Oriel, USA) on an illumination area of 1 cm2 of the working electrode. The photocurrent density was obtained from the difference between the light and dark current, while light current and dark current data were used to obtain the open circuit voltage (Voc) and resistance of the thin films respectively.9,36 The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of the system was obtained using the formula in eqn (2):10,34,35 ABPE = {Jph × (1.23 − Vb)/P} × 100(2)where Jph is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), Vb is the applied bias (V) and P is the illumination power intensity (mW cm−2). The value of Vb is the difference between the values of Vmeas and Voc (Vmeas − Voc). Vmeas is the potential (V/SCE) of the working electrode at which the Jph is measured.9 Carrier separation efficiency was calculated in the presence of H2O2 and the calculation was performed using the method reported by Abdi et al.32
The electrochemical workstation Zahner, PP211, CIMPS-pcs was used to obtain the incident photon-to-current efficiency measurements using the three electrode cell under illumination conditions, using a wideband white LED tunable light source with an output intensity of 1.02 W m−2 attached to a separate monochromator, in the 430–720 nm range.
Mott–Schottky analyses and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (from Nyquist plots) were also performed to analyze the charge transfer characteristics of the system. Mott–Schottky measurements were performed under dark conditions by varying the DC potential from 1 V/SCE to −1 V/SCE with a 10 kHz AC potential frequency and an amplitude of 10 mV, to measure the capacitance (C) at the semiconductor/electrolyte junction. A plot between 1/C2 and the applied potential (Vapp) was used to calculate the flatband potential (VFB) of the samples using eqn (3).35–37 (3)where C is the space charge capacitance, q is the charge on the carrier, ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, ε is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor, ND is the donor density, Vapp is the externally applied electrode potential, VFB is the flatband potential at the semiconductor/electrolyte junction, k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature of operation. A DC potential of 1 V/SCE and an AC potential frequency range (100000–0.1 Hz) with a 10 mV amplitude were used to obtain the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data in the form of Nyquist plots to measure the charge transfer resistance.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Microstructure analysis
The phases of the prepared thin film samples were confirmed using X-ray diffractograms that showed a rhombohedral phase evolution of crystalline hematite (Fig. 2), and this was confirmed using JCPDS card no. 24-0072. The peaks present at 2θ = 24.12, 33.11, 35.61, 40.43, 49.41 and 54.00 degrees correspond to (012), (104), (110), (113), (024) and (116) hkl planes of rhombohedral hematite respectively. No other impurity peaks or other mixed oxide phases were identified in the XRD patterns, except for the peaks of the ITO substrate. A Debye Scherrer equation was used to calculate the particle size and this was based on the maximum intensity of the (104) peak (the highest intensity peak was the (110) peak). The particle sizes varied from 17 nm to 34 nm for 0% Ti doped Fe2O3 to 8% Ti doped Fe2O3. Therefore, at a low doping concentration the particle size was small, while with a higher doping concentration the particle size had increased. An increase in the particle size at a higher doping concentration has also been reported by Upadhyay et al.38 The increase in particle size will decrease the surface area in the case of 8% Ti-Fe2O3 and thus a decrease in the PEC activity was observed. However, very small particles also provide hindrance for the carrier separation. For the present study, the optimum size for the best PEC performance is 20–22 nm. Changes in the catalytic activity with a change in the particle size have been reported by various authors.39–42

3.2. XPS and SIMS analysis
XPS analysis was performed for the 2% Ti-Fe2O3 and 8% Ti-Fe2O3 samples and the results are shown in Fig. 3(a)–(c). The binding energies for the Fe 2p3/2, O 1s1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 peaks were obtained as 710 eV, 531.8 eV and 457.8 eV respectively. The obtained values are close to the values reported by Magnan et al.43 XPS peak fitting software was used for peak fitting and quantitative analysis of the data revealed that the actual atomic concentration of Ti in 2% Ti-Fe2O3 and 8% Ti-Fe2O3 was 1.5 at% and 5.3 at% respectively.

To confirm the presence of a gradient for the dopant concentration throughout the depth of the 0.5–8% Ti-Fe2O3 sample, SIMS analysis was performed and Fig. 3(d) clearly shows an increase in the dopant concentration with progression of the time of sputtering i.e. with depth. SIMS is one of the useful techniques for depth profiling thin films to ascertain the presence of any element at a particular thickness.44
3.3. Morphology analysis

Fig. 4 shows scanning electron micrographs of both the pristine and doped samples using a 25 keV electron beam. The surface morphology of the hematite thin films is mesoporous in nature with dense packing of the particles. The obtained morphology is similar to the morphology obtained by Kumari et al.31 and Souza et al.46Fig. 4(a) and (b) respectively show 0% Ti-Fe2O3 and 1% Ti-Fe2O3, and reveal that the particle sizes are small. Whereas Fig. 4(c) shows 8% Ti-Fe2O3 and the particles are bigger in size due to agglomeration. The particles sizes estimated from SEM using image J software48 are in close compliance with the particle size calculated from the XRD data. To measure the thickness of all the films prepared by spraying for a total duration of 100 s, a cross-sectional SEM image of Grad. 0.5–8% Ti-Fe2O3 was obtained and is shown in Fig. 4(d). The approximate thickness of the film is around 540 nm.

To confirm the presence of Ti in the hematite samples, elemental composition analysis was done using EDX mapping through an area scan and the results are shown in Fig. 5(a)–(d). A peak for Ti was clearly observed (marked with red circles in Fig. 5) for the Ti-doped hematite samples and was found to increase in intensity with increase of the doping level.

3.4. Optical absorption spectrum analysis
Absorption spectra were obtained for the visible range from 400–800 nm and absorbance vs. wavelength data were utilized to obtain the optical band gaps of the various thin films from a Tauc plot (Fig. 6). The best fit was obtained for indirect band gap transitions, and the value of the band gap for undoped Fe2O3 was found to be 1.96 eV and for 8% Ti-Fe2O3 it reaches up to 1.66 eV. A significant change in the band gap indicates the presence of intermediate levels between the conduction band and valence band of Fe2O3. The estimated values for the band gaps obtained from Tauc plots are listed in Table 2. Significant changes in the band gap after heavy doping have also been observed by other authors.31,47
 Fig. 6  Tauc plot of the hematite thin films. 
3.5. Photoelectrochemical performance measurement
Current vs. applied potential (I–V) plots were obtained under both dark and illumination conditions and were utilized to obtain the photocurrent density (Jph). The values for the photocurrent densities at 0.9 V/SCE (1.1 V/RHE) are provided in Table 3. It was observed that there is a significant enhancement in the Jph for the Grad. 0.5–8% Ti-Fe2O3 sample in comparison to the undoped Fe2O3 sample. The plots of Jph (mA cm−2) vs. applied bias (V/SCE) are shown in Fig. 7(a). It can be seen from the plots that the Jph increased for up to 2 at% of Ti doping, after which it started decreasing for higher dopant concentrations. Values for the open circuit voltage (Voc) and resistance were obtained from the I–V plots. The increase in resistance and thereby decrease in Jph above 2 at% of Ti doping can be attributed to recombination centers developed at a higher doping concentration.38 In the case of the Grad. 0.5–8% Ti-Fe2O3 sample, least resistance was obtained as shown in Fig. 7(b), which further confirms the better conductivity of this film. The maximum value for the open circuit voltage was also obtained with the Grad. 0.5–8% Ti-Fe2O3 sample, which indicates less recombination of charge carriers.32,38,45 The increase in the carrier separation efficiency with the Grad. 0.5–8% Ti-Fe2O3 sample, in comparison to 2% Ti-Fe2O3, is shown in Fig. 7(c).

The flat band potential (VFB) is an effective measure for analyzing the charge carrier separation at the electrode–electrolyte interface and the Mott–Schottky (M–S) curves are shown in Fig. 8(a). A positive slope of the M–S plot indicates that the nature of the material is n-type and confirms that the majority of the charge carriers are electrons. The value of VFB for the undoped Fe2O3 is 0.70 V/SCE and a maximum value (0.90 V/SCE) was observed for the Grad. 0.5–8% Ti-Fe2O3 sample, which shows a shift of 0.20 V/SCE. The values for the flat band potential are given in Table 3. A higher magnitude of negative value for the flat band potential, in the case of n-type semiconductors, indicates better separation and transport of charge carriers at the semiconductor electrode–electrolyte interface and therefore is responsible for the enhanced PEC performance.34,47 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were obtained under visible light illumination conditions to measure the charge transfer resistance of the best performing samples and compare this with the undoped Fe2O3 (pristine) sample. The Nyquist plots are presented in Fig. 8(b). All the tested films showed a semicircle nature but the diameter of the semicircle was smallest for the Grad. 0.5–8% Ti-Fe2O3 sample. The lesser diameter indicates improvement in the charge transfer with least resistance.35–37,47

ABPE values calculated for all the systems using eqn (2) are provided in Table 3. A maximum efficiency of 1.49% was obtained with the Grad. 0.5–8% Ti Fe2O3 sample. The resistance for all the films is shown in Fig. 7(b). It can be seen from all the measured values of photoelectrochemical data that the optimum doping concentration is 2 at% Ti, with an ABPE value of 0.65%, but Grad. 0.5–8%-Ti-Fe2O3 shows an enhanced photocurrent and hence a high ABPE in comparison to the other samples.

3.5.1. IPCE measurement. 
To account for the excitons generated per incident photon flux, IPCE measurements were performed at 0.9 V/SCE (1.1 V/RHE) using the modified gradient concentration sample. It can be seen in Fig. 9 that the IPCE reaches 24% at 400 nm and that the sample exhibits a net two-fold increment in the IPCE response in comparison with the 2% Ti-Fe2O3 sample.

3.5.2. Mechanism discussion. 
The mechanism of charge transfer in the gradient doped sample is presented in Fig. 10. It is known that the flat band potential is indicative of the charge separation efficiency and, in the present study, the maximum VFB was obtained with the 0.5–8% Ti-Fe2O3 (low to high concentration of dopant towards the substrate) sample and the presence of the least charge transfer resistance with the same sample was also confirmed from the Nyquist plot. The maximum VFB suggested that enhanced band bending is present in the gradient doped sample. Wang et al.33 have reported that N doping in ZnO shifts the valence band position towards the upward side, since the nature of the N dopant is p-type and ZnO is n-type in nature. They have also reported that at the interface between the undoped ZnO and N-ZnO, a depletion layer is formed, which acts as a built-in electric field source and promotes charge transfer. In the present case, both the Ti dopant and Fe2O3 are n-type in nature. The dopant (Ti) may cause the Fermi level to shift gradually towards the conduction band as the dopant (Ti) concentration increases to 8 at%. The differences in the Fermi levels of the dopant layers result in electron transfer from one layer to another, until they become collinear, which causes band bending across the thickness of the semiconductor film. In the case of the best performing gradient doped sample (Grad. 0.5–8%-Ti-Fe2O3), on moving towards the higher dopant concentration layer (moving from the illuminated side towards the substrate), band bending will increase. Fermi level equilibration results for the generation of an electric field, which is additive throughout the film and facilitates movement of electrons towards the substrate, are shown in Fig. 10(a).
 Fig. 10  (a) Changes is the Fermi level position due to doping (Blue line represents the conduction band minima while yellow line represents the valence band maxima, dotted red line shows Fermi level and black line is used to show the band bending at the junctions) (b) Charge transfer mechanism in Grad. 0.5–8% Ti-Fe2O3 sample. 
The easy flow of charge in the present case can be explained by the steeper slope formed due to the band bending. This type of arrangement causes an increase in the built-in electric field, which leads to increased charge separation, which is diagrammatically represented in Fig. 10(b). A similar kind of observation has also been reported by Abdi et al.32 and they also concluded that creation of an n–n+ junction between the different dopant layers (0–1% W) in BiVO4 enhances the charge separation throughout the thickness of the film.
Therefore upon illumination of the Grad. 0.5–8% Ti-Fe2O3 sample, transfer of electrons to the ITO substrate is easier and self controlled, and leads to a high PEC performance for solar water splitting and hydrogen evolution. In the case of Grad. 8–0.5% Ti-Fe2O3, band bending is present in the opposite direction and this limits the flow of electrons by acting as barrier.

4. Conclusions
Introduction of a gradient concentration of Ti dopant in a Fe2O3 system, one of the most promising dopant systems, has been investigated for the first time and the results obtained are inspiring as such a gradation of the dopant concentration results in a low recombination rate of charge carriers and thus results in an enhanced photoelectrochemical response. The higher value of VFB and least charge transfer resistance are accountable for the high photocurrent density and efficiency values, although the high Voc and least resistance are also responsible for the better performance of the Grad. 0.5–8% Ti-Fe2O3 sample.
