    , Accepted 18th October 2013First published on 21st October 2013AbstractBinary additives synergistically boost the power conversion efficiency of all-polymer solar cells up to 3.45%. The nonvolatile additive PDI-2DTT suppresses aggregation of the acceptor PPDIDTT and enhances donor/acceptor mixing, while the additive DIO facilitates aggregation and crystallization of the donor PBDTTT-C-T as well as improves phase separation. Combination of DIO and PDI-2DTT leads to suitable phase separation and improved and balanced charge transport, which is beneficial to efficiency enhancement.

Broader context
All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), which consist of a p-type semiconducting polymer as an electron donor and an n-type semiconducting polymer as an electron acceptor, have some advantages over polymer:fullerene solar cells, such as broad and strong absorption and suitable lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the electron acceptor, good film-forming and roll-to-roll printing properties and good stability upon continuous bending. Unfortunately, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all-PSCs are still inferior to those of polymer:fullerene solar cells, and only a few papers reported the PCEs over 2%. In this work, the authors fabricated all-PSCs consisting of low-bandgap polymer donor PBDTTT-C-T and low-bandgap polymer acceptor PPDIDTT. They used a conjugated molecule PDI-2DTT with a similar structure to that of the polymer acceptor as a nonvolatile additive to suppress aggregation of polymer acceptor PPDIDTT and to facilitate mixing with the polymer donor. They also used solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) to facilitate aggregation and crystallization of the polymer donor as well as improve phase separation. Combination of PDI-2DTT and DIO led to suitable phase separation and improved and balanced charge transport, which was beneficial to efficiency enhancement. The binary additives synergistically boosted the PCE of all-PSCs up to 3.45%, which is the highest reported for all-PSCs.

Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention because of some advantages such as simple preparation, light weight, low cost and large area flexible fabrication.1–6 In the past decade, numerous studies focused on design and synthesis of high-mobility and low-bandgap polymers or small molecule donor materials,7–11 fullerene derivatives or non-fullerene acceptor materials,12–16 morphology control of active layers17–22 and optimization of device structures.23–32 Nowadays, BHJ PSCs based on interpenetrating networks of semiconducting polymers and fullerene derivatives have shown the best performance with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) that exceed 9%.25,27,33–35
All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), which consist of a p-type semiconducting polymer as an electron donor and an n-type semiconducting polymer as an electron acceptor, have some advantages over polymer:fullerene solar cells. Firstly, as a widely used fullerene derivative electron acceptor, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric-acid-methyl-ester (PC61BM) exhibits only weak absorption in the visible region, while n-type semiconducting polymers can achieve broad and strong absorption via molecule design. Secondly, lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels in n-type semiconducting polymers can be adjusted to achieve a suitable charge separation driving force and high open circuit voltage (VOC) even overcoming the VOC limitation (ca. 1.1 V) towards high PCEs. Thirdly, all-polymer blends generally exhibit good film-forming and roll-to-roll printing properties36 and good stability upon continuous bending.37 Unfortunately, the PCEs of all-PSCs are still inferior to those of polymer:fullerene solar cells, and only a few papers reported the PCEs over 2%.15,38–41 There are two main restrictions to obtain high efficiency of all-PSCs, one is relatively low electron mobility42 and electron affinity43 of n-type semiconducting polymers; the other is poor phase separation caused by entanglement of polymer chains in the all-polymer blend films.44 Considerable efforts have been dedicated to the synthesis of n-type semiconducting polymers for all-PSCs, such as perylene diimide (PDI),14,15,41,45–47 naphthalene diimide (NDI)48–51 or benzothiadiazole (BT) based copolymers.37–39,52,53 Meanwhile, thermal annealing,38,49 suitable solvents,48,49 mixture solvents,15 solvent additives,50,51 laminated fabrication,54 nanopatterned fabrication53 and inverted structures41 are used to achieve efficient phase separation and suitable morphology.
In this work, we fabricated all-PSCs consisting of low-bandgap polymer donor PBDTTT-C-T9 and low-bandgap polymer acceptor PPDIDTT (Fig. 1).14 As reported in our previous work, both PBDTTT-C-T and PPDIDTT exhibited high mobilities (>0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 measured by a field-effect transistor), broad absorption (300–800 nm) and good film-forming properties.9,14 We use a conjugated molecule PDI-2DTT46 (Fig. 1) with a similar structure to that of the polymer acceptor as a nonvolatile additive to suppress aggregation of polymer acceptor PPDIDTT and to facilitate mixing with the polymer donor. We also use widely used solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)8,9,17,25,51,55,56 to enhance crystallization of the polymer donor and phase separation. The binary additives synergistically boost the PCE of all-PSCs to 3.45%, which is the highest value reported for all-PSCs.
 Fig. 1  Molecule structures of PBDTTT-C-T, PPDIDTT, PDI-2DTT and DIO. 
As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and LUMO energy levels of PBDTTT-C-T are more than 0.6 eV higher than those of PPDIDTT, indicating that the energy level positions of the donor and acceptor are suitable for efficient charge transfer and separation at the interface between these two polymers.9,14 The fluorescence intensity of the PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT (1:1, w/w) blend film decreases significantly compared to that of PBDTTT-C-T and PPDIDTT (Fig. S2†); the strong fluorescence quenching suggests efficient photoinduced charge transfer at the donor/acceptor interface.
All-PSCs with a conventional structure were fabricated using blends with different weight ratios of donor:acceptor and different additive contents. Fig. 2 shows J–V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of devices with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT (1:1, w/w)/Ca/Al without or with additives under the illumination of an AM 1.5G solar simulator, 100 mW cm−2. Table 1 summarizes the average and best device characteristics based on PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT (1:1, w/w) blend films without or with additives. The data with other donor:acceptor ratios are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The weight ratio of the nonvolatile additive:PPDIDTT affects the short circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH), but does not exert an obvious effect on VOC. The PCE and RSH increase first and then decrease with increasing PDI-2DTT content, while the RS shows a contrary trend. The solar cells based on PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT (1:1, w/w) exhibit the best performance when the PDI-2DTT ratio is 2%; the average JSC increases from 4.34 to 4.84 mA cm−2, the average FF increases from 35.0% to 39.3%, and the average PCE increases from 1.16% to 1.43% (Table 1 and Fig. S3 in the ESI†). However, the PCE of a control device based on PBDTTT-C-T:PDI-2DTT (1:1, w/w) is only 0.26% (Fig. S4, ESI†).

With increasing amount of solvent additive DIO from 3% to 7% (volume ratio), the average JSC and PCE increase first and then decrease, while the RSH and FF remain increasing (Fig. S5 and Table S1, ESI†). The devices based on PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT (1:1, w/w) with 6% DIO exhibit the best performance: the average VOC, JSC, FF and PCE are 0.753 V, 7.92 mA cm−2, 48.9% and 2.92%, respectively.
Furthermore, after addition of binary additives PDI-2DTT and DIO, the solar cells exhibit even higher JSC, FF and PCE (Fig. S6, ESI†). The binary additives synergistically promote the efficiency of all-PSCs. The devices based on PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT (1:1, w/w) with 2% PDI-2DTT and 6% DIO exhibit an average VOC of 0.752 V, JSC of 8.55 mA cm−2, FF of 51.5% and PCE of 3.31%. The JSC of 8.55 mA cm−2 is the highest reported for all-PSCs. The best PCE of these devices is 3.45%, which is much higher than the best PCE (2.23%)15 reported for perylene diimide polymer acceptors and the best PCE (2.7%)38 reported for all kinds of polymer acceptors. These all-PSCs also have good long-term stability, the PCEs remained 95% of initial device efficiencies in a glove box after two weeks (Fig. S7, ESI†).
As shown in Fig. 2b, the trend of EQE is similar to JSC. The EQE in the 430–800 nm range is mainly attributed to PBDTTT-C-T,9 while that below 430 nm is mainly contributed by PPDIDTT.14 The EQE is obviously enhanced by the use of nonvolatile additive and solvent additive. Moreover, binary additives show a synergistic effect on enhancement of EQE. On the other hand, the EQE related to PPDIDTT is obviously enhanced by the use of a nonvolatile additive. To evaluate the accuracy of the photovoltaic results, the JSC values were calculated from integration of the EQE spectra with the AM 1.5G reference spectrum. The calculated JSC is similar to the J–V measurement (the average error is 1.9%, Table 1).
Since the chemical structure of nonvolatile additive PDI-2DTT is very similar to the repeating unit of the acceptor polymer, it should be very compatible with the acceptor polymer. When PPDIDTT is doped with PDI-2DTT, the aggregation of PPDIDTT is suppressed due to well mixing of PPDIDTT and PDI-2DTT. As shown in Fig. 3a, addition of nonvolatile additive PDI-2DTT leads to blue shift of absorption spectra of PPDIDTT (the absorption spectrum of PDI-2DTT is very similar to that of PPDI-DTT57), indicating the decrease in aggregation and intermolecular interaction of PPDIDTT. Furthermore, charge recombination in PPDIDTT is reduced, leading to enhancement of EQE related to the acceptor and increase of RSH. The hole and electron mobilities of PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT (1:1, w/w) blend films were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method58 (Table 2 and Fig. S8 in the ESI†). The electron mobility increases from 5.07 × 10−6 to 1.35 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 with 2% PDI-2DTT. The higher electron mobility is beneficial to higher RSH which reduces geminate charge recombination.59Fig. 4 shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) height and phase images of PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT (1:1, w/w) blend films. The blend film becomes more smooth (root-mean-square (RMS) roughness decreases from 0.532 to 0.396 nm) and uniform after the use of nonvolatile additive PDI-2DTT, due to reduced aggregation of the acceptor and enhanced donor/acceptor mixing. The average PCE increases by 23% when the weight ratio of PDI-2DTT/PPDIDTT is 2%, which is attributed to reduced aggregation of the acceptor, enhanced donor/acceptor mixing, and reduced charge recombination.

 Fig. 4  AFM height images and phase images ((a–d) for plane height images, (e–h) for 3D height images and (i–l) for phase images) of PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT (1:1, w/w) blend films spin-coated on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates: (a, e and i) as cast, (b, f and j) with 2% PDI-2DTT, (c, g and k) with 6% DIO, (d, h and l) with 6% DIO and 2% PDI-2DTT. The scan sizes for all images are 3 μm × 3 μm. 
As shown in Fig. 4, the RMS roughness of PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT (1:1, w/w) blend films significantly increases from 0.532 to 9.20 nm and the phase separation is significantly enhanced after addition of 6% DIO additive. DIO leads to larger domain sizes of the donor due to enhanced aggregation and crystallization of PBDTTT-C-T, which is supported by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. S9, ESI†). Another piece of evidence for the aggregation of PBDTTT-C-T is red shift of absorption spectra caused by the use of DIO (Fig. 3b). After adding 6% DIO, the hole mobility of PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT (1:1, w/w) blend films slightly increases from 1.30 × 10−4 to 1.82 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while the electron mobility obviously increases from 5.07 × 10−6 to 1.43 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table 2 and Fig. S8 in the ESI†). The improvement in charge transport is attributed to better phase separation and enhanced donor and acceptor phase aggregation. The improved electron and hole mobilities are beneficial to the decreased RS and increased RSH (Table 1).60 The average PCE increases by 152% with addition of 6% DIO, which is attributed to enhanced aggregation of the donor, enhanced phase separation, and reduced charge recombination.
The RMS roughness of PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT (1:1, w/w) blend films with 2% PDI-2DTT and 6% DIO is 8.13 nm, which is larger than that with 2% PDI-2DTT but smaller than that with 6% DIO (Fig. 4). The phase separation size is larger than that with 2% PDI-2DTT but smaller than that with 6% DIO. Combination of DIO and PDI-2DTT facilitates reduced aggregation of the acceptor, enhanced donor/acceptor mixing, and enhanced aggregation and crystallization of the donor. After adding 2% PDI-2DTT and 6% DIO, the hole mobility of PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT (1:1, w/w) blend films is 2.64 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, larger than that with 2% PDI-2DTT or 6% DIO; the electron mobility is 3.37 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 larger than that with 2% PDI-2DTT or 6% DIO (Table 2). The improved electron and hole mobilities are beneficial to the decrease in RS (Table 1). The average PCE with 2% PDI-2DTT and 6% DIO is 3.31%, which is larger than that (1.43 or 2.92%) with 2% PDI-2DTT or 6% DIO (Table 2). The PCE enhancement is attributed to suitable phase separation and improved and balanced charge transport.
In conclusion, the nonvolatile additive PDI-2DTT reduces the aggregation of polymer acceptor PPDIDTT, enhances donor/acceptor mixing, and achieves efficient charge transfer at the donor/acceptor interface, leading to average PCE enhancement from 1.16% to 1.43% (with 2% PDI-2DTT). The solvent additive DIO facilitates aggregation and crystallization of the donor as well as enhanced phase separation, leading to average PCE improvement from 1.16% to 2.92% (with 6% DIO). Finally, combination of DIO and PDI-2DTT leads to suitable phase separation and improved and balanced charge transport, and boosts the PCE of all-PSCs up to 3.45%, which is the highest reported for all-PSCs. Our preliminary results demonstrate that using binary additives could be a promising way towards high-performance all-polymer solar cells.
Experimental section
Polymers PPDIDTT14 and PBDTTT-C-T9 were synthesized according to our previously reported procedures and have similar molecular weights to those reported in previous work. PDI-2DTT was synthesized according to our previously reported procedure.46 Bulk heterojunction all-polymer solar cells were fabricated with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT/Ca/Al. The patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass (sheet resistance = 15 Ω □−1) was pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropanol, and treated in an ultraviolet–ozone chamber (Jelight Company, USA) for 23 min. A thin layer (35 nm) of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P VP AI 4083, Germany) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass and baked at 150 °C for 20 min. A mixture of PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT in 1,2-dichlorobenzene solvent (20 mg mL−1 in total) with or without additives was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a photosensitive layer. The thickness of PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT blend films was ca. 60–85 nm, measured using a Ambios Technology XP-2 profilometer. A calcium (ca. 20 nm) and aluminium layer (ca. 100 nm) was then evaporated onto the surface of the photosensitive layer under vacuum (ca. 10−5 Pa) to form the negative electrode. The active area of the device was 4 mm2. The J–V curve was measured with a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. A xenon lamp coupled to AM 1.5G solar spectrum filters was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. The EQE spectrum was measured using a Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled to a WDG3 monochromator and 500 W xenon lamp.
Thin-film (on quartz substrate) UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-570 spectrophotometer. Thin-film (on quartz substrate) emission spectra were recorded on a Hitachi F-4500 spectrofluorophotometer. Thin-film XRD patterns were recorded using a Rigaku at 40 kV and 200 mA with a scanning rate of 0.02 degree per s, and Cu/K radiation with wavelength λ = 1.54056 Å. Hole-only or electron-only diodes were fabricated using the architectures: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT/Au for holes and Al/PBDTTT-C-T:PPDIDTT/Al for electrons. All semiconductor layers have the same thickness (100 ± 2 nm). Mobilities were extracted by fitting the current density–voltage curves using the Mott–Gurney relationship (space charge limited current). The nanoscale morphology of blend films was observed using an atomic force microscope (AFM) (NanoMan VS, Veeco, USA) in contact mode.

Broader context
All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), which consist of a p-type semiconducting polymer as an electron donor and an n-type semiconducting polymer as an electron acceptor, have some advantages over polymer:fullerene solar cells, such as broad and strong absorption and suitable lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the electron acceptor, good film-forming and roll-to-roll printing properties and good stability upon continuous bending. Unfortunately, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all-PSCs are still inferior to those of polymer:fullerene solar cells, and only a few papers reported the PCEs over 2%. In this work, the authors fabricated all-PSCs consisting of low-bandgap polymer donor PBDTTT-C-T and low-bandgap polymer acceptor PPDIDTT. They used a conjugated molecule PDI-2DTT with a similar structure to that of the polymer acceptor as a nonvolatile additive to suppress aggregation of polymer acceptor PPDIDTT and to facilitate mixing with the polymer donor. They also used solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) to facilitate aggregation and crystallization of the polymer donor as well as improve phase separation. Combination of PDI-2DTT and DIO led to suitable phase separation and improved and balanced charge transport, which was beneficial to efficiency enhancement. The binary additives synergistically boosted the PCE of all-PSCs up to 3.45%, which is the highest reported for all-PSCs.
