    , Accepted 22nd May 2023First published on 22nd May 2023AbstractWe report a solution-processing method to prepare an inorganic LaNiO3 (LNO) hole-transport layer (HTL) under low temperature (<150 °C) for the first time. The inverted PSCs prepared with LNO exhibit high UV-stability and promising efficiency (17.15%). Our preliminary results show great potential for LNO HTL in the fabrication of efficient and photostable inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs).
In the last decade, metal halide perovskites have been extensively investigated for many applications, including solar cells,1 photodetectors,2 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),3 and lasers.4 Among them, photovoltaic applications have attracted the most attention with the power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) being boosted from 3.8% to a certified 25.7%.5,6 They are expected to become a viable alternative to replace the current market-leading polycrystalline silicon solar cells in the future. To date, most of the certified efficiencies have been achieved on n-i-p devices with mesoporous-TiO2 as an electron transport layer; however, high-temperature sintering (over 500 °C) is required and there is photo-instability due to the photocatalytic effect of TiO2 under UV illumination.7,8 In contrast, inverted (p-i-n structure) devices with low-cost processed charge transporting layers (CTLs) have been regarded as promising candidates to realize the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaic technology.
The hole-transport layer (HTL) plays a pivotal role in improving the efficiency and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs).9 Currently, various organic HTLs have been explored, such as PEDOT: PSS and PTAA. Although high efficiency could be achieved, their easy degradation under UV light hinders their commercial application.10,11 Compared with organic HTLs, inorganic HTLs are more inherently stable under illumination.12 Various solution-processed metal oxides have been developed as HTLs in inverted PSCs, such as NiOx, VOx, CuxO, CuSCN, and WO3.13 Among them, NiOx has been studied most due to its suitable energy band structure, good transparency and photo-stability.12 While NiOx is non-stoichiometric and usually consists of NiO, Ni2O3 and even NiOOH. The Ni2+ vacancies (usually in the form of under-coordinated Ni3+ species) on the surface of the NiOx film could cause serious degradation of the perovskite and deterioration in the hole-transfer kinetics at the NiOx/perovskite interface, especially under UV irradiation.12,14 Therefore, an additional layer is usually needed to passivate the defects to alleviate this damage. However, the UV-photostability of inverted PSCs is still unsatisfactory due to the lack of appropriate HTLs which could fabricate photostable PSCs without damaging their efficiency.
Lanthanum nickelate (LaNiO3, abbreviated to LNO) is a p-type semiconducting perovskite oxide with a wide bandgap of 3.9 eV. It has several advantages, such as high conductivity, thermoelectricity, and a UV-stable chemical structure, which enable a wide variety of applications in sensors, conductive transparent films, and electrode materials.15–17 It may be a promising alternative to replace NiOx as an HTL in fabricating photostable inverted PSCs. However, the need in the traditional synthesis method for high-temperature sintering (nearly 700 °C) to prepare LNO film hinders its deposition on glass substrates, which impedes its application in fabricating PSC devices.18 This may be the main reason for its rare employment in solar cells, without even any application in PSCs thus far. Therefore, a low-temperature processing method is a prerequisite for the application of LNO films in fabricating photostable PSCs, but it is still a great challenge.
Herein, we propose low-temperature solution-processed inorganic LNO nanoparticles (NPs) as an HTL to fabricate photostable inverted PSCs for the first time. Uniform LNO films could be facilely formed at a temperature below 150 °C by spin-coating well-dispersed LNO NPs which are innovatively prepared with H2O2 as an oxidizing agent and ammonia as a precipitating agent. Microstructural characterizations, such as TEM, XPS, and XRD, demonstrate that the as-prepared LNO films have a good-crystalline perovskite-type structure. UPS characterization shows that the LNO films have a higher valence band maximum (VBM) than their perovskite counterparts, which could facilitate efficient hole transfer at the interface. Moreover, the LNO films demonstrate a stable perovskite-type chemical structure, enabling a stable LNO/perovskite interface under UV irradiation. In addition, the large band gap of LNO leads to strong UV absorption, so it can serve as a UV filter. These two advantages provide the as-prepared PSC with excellent UV stability which could retain 70% of its initial PCE after 250 h, while a NiOx-based device could maintain only 52% after 100 h. A PSC prepared with LNO could reach a PCE of 14.39%. After further passivation with 2PACz ([2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid), a remarkable PCE of 17.15% was obtained. Furthermore, an unencapsulated LNO/2PACz-based PSC exhibited much higher UV stability which could maintain about 85% of its initial PCE after 400 hours under continuous UV irradiation (8 W m−2).
LNO films can usually be prepared using a sputtering method, pulsed laser deposition, or a sol–gel method.18 Among them, the solution-processing method is low-cost and compatible with large-scale mass production. However, the required sintering temperature is too high (>600 °C) for deposition on flexible or even glass substrates. To tackle this dilemma, synthesizing well-dispersed LNO NPs is a reliable approach to preparing LNO films at low temperature. Therefore, we prepared the LNO NPs with a modified low-temperature solution process via the reaction of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, La(NO3)3·6H2O, and citric acid dissolved in H2O2 aqueous solution (30% H2O2) in an ice bath. Then light green powders were obtained by the addition of a certain amount of ammonia as a precipitating agent, as reported in our previous work.19 Here, H2O2 was used as an efficient oxidizing agent to partially transform Ni2+ to Ni3+.20 The experimental details can be found in the supporting information. The obtained precipitates were centrifuged, washed, vacuum dried and sintered to form LNO NPs, and then dispersed in 2-methoxyethanol (2ME) to form an LNO colloidal solution (Fig. S1, ESI†). The compact and uniform LNO layer as an HTL was successfully fabricated by spin-coating the colloidal solution onto glass/ITO substrates and annealing at 150 °C (Fig. 1).

TEM characterization was performed to study the morphology and crystal structure of the as-prepared LNO NPs. As shown in Fig. 2a, the crystal size of most NPs is in the range of 20–50 nm. Fig. 2b shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) of LNO NPs, where the well-determined diffraction rings and the clear lattice fringes indicate the polycrystalline nature of the as-prepared LNO NPs. The X-ray diffraction pattern (Fig. 2c and Fig. S2, ESI†) of the LNO NPs shows notable diffraction peaks at 23.3°, 32.9°, 47.4° and 58.7°, which are consistent with diffraction of the (101), (110), (202), and (122) planes of standard LNO materials.18 This suggests that LNO NPs with a perovskite-type structure have been successfully formed with different sintering temperatures. In addition, with an increase in sintering temperature, the intensity of the XRD peak increased, indicating that the crystallinity of the LNO NPs increased (Fig. S2, ESI†). We have prepared devices using LNO-1, LNO-2 and LNO-3 as HTLs (prepared at sintering temperatures of 600 °C, 650 °C and 700 °C, respectively). The experimental results show that LNO-2 has the best device performance (Fig. S6, ESI†). Therefore, in the following discussion we carry out detailed characterization based on the LNO-2 NPs.

(g) UPS spectra, (h) Tauc plot, and (i) Transmittance spectra of the as-prepared LNO-2 film. 
The chemical composition and chemical bonds of the main elements in the prepared LNO NPs were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization. A typical survey spectrum obtained from XPS shows that the material is mainly composed of O, La, and Ni, with percentages of 42.21, 12.08 and 18.05%, respectively (Fig. S3, ESI†). Hence, it is believed that there are no other impurities in the LNO NPs. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2d, the deconvolved peak located at a binding energy of 528.49 represents O2−, which is lattice oxygen in LNO materials, whereas the peak located at a binding energy of 531.29 eV may arise from ambient moisture.21
The Ni 2p1/2, Ni satellite, and Ni 2p3/2 peaks which appear at 872.53, 863.01 and 854.81 eV, respectively, indicate that fully oxidized Ni3+ is the main form in the film (Fig. 2e).18,22,23 Moreover, the other three peaks at 850.90, 837.79, and 834.27 eV belong to La 3d3/2 and La 3d5/2, indicating that valence La3+ is also present in the LNO film.24 It is noteworthy that these two peaks (837.79 and 834.27 eV) produce a deviation of about 3.5 eV due to the spin–orbit interaction and superposition of La 3d3/2 and Ni 2p3/2 (Fig. 2f and Fig. S4, ESI†).25 Based on the above analysis, the as-prepared LNO films have covalent bonds of Ni–O and La–O and ionic bonds of Ni3+ and La3+, which suggests the successful formation of a stable perovskite-type crystal structure in the LNO films.
The band structure of the LNO film was studied with ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Fig. 2g shows the cutoff and near Ef region of the UPS spectra, where the VBM of LNO film was calculated as −5.22 eV. In addition, the energy band gap (Eg) of LNO film can be obtained from the absorption spectra based on the characteristic hν−(Ahν)x curves, as shown in Fig. 2h.26 Therefore, the LNO thin film shows a bandgap value of around 3.9 eV. The large bandgap gives the LNO films excellent visible light transmittance and high UV light absorption (Fig. 2i).
The photovoltaic performance of devices with an LNO HTL was investigated in PSCs with an inverted structure of ITO/LNO/FA0.4MA0.6PbI3/PCBM/BCP/Ag and the corresponding device structure and energy level diagram are illustrated in Fig. 3a and b. The higher VBM of LNO films than their perovskite counterparts would facilitate hole transfer at the interface. We prepared the device and optimized the concentration of LNO colloidal solution and the sintering temperature of LNO NPs. It should be noted that an LNO film obtained at a relatively low concentration (2 mg mL−1) shows the best performance (see the optimization of the solution concentration in Fig. S5 and Table S1, ESI†). Obviously, a thinner LNO-2 film could be fabricated, which is beneficial for realizing a high photocurrent in a PSC, because the charge transfer resistance is reduced. The J–V curves of the devices with three different LNO HTLs are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). Planar PSCs with LNO-2 HTL delivered the highest PCE of up to 14.39%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.07 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 20.13 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.67. The lower sintering temperature may result in a less crystalline LNO and a higher temperature would decompose the LNO crystal. These may lead to lower photovoltaic performances with PCEs of 12.91% for LNO-1 and 13.52% for LNO-3 HTLs, respectively.

Apart from HTL and 2PACz, the energy level values were taken from the literature.12 (c) The J–V curves of devices with LNO-2 and LNO-2/2PACz. (d) Stability of unencapsulated PSCs based on NiOx, LNO-2 and LNO-2/2PACz HTLs under continuous UV irradiation in an ambient atmosphere. 
To better understand the varied performance of the devices with three different LNO HTLs in PSCs, the charge transfer kinetics at the HTL/perovskite interfaces were further investigated. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of the perovskite films on three LNO HTLs were carried out to investigate the charge transfer at the interface (Fig. S7a and b, ESI†). The PL of the perovskite film was significantly quenched in the presence of LNO films. Among them, the LNO-2 sample has a higher quenching efficiency and a shorter carrier life (the fitting data are shown in Table S3, ESI†), clearly indicating more efficient charge transfer efficiency at the buried interface than in other LNO HTL counterparts. In addition, we also carried out electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of devices with three LNO HTLs in PSCs, and the Nyquist plots were tested under dark field conditions with a bias voltage of 1 V (Fig. S7c, ESI†). In general, the single semicircle refers to charge recombination resistance values (Rrec).27 Compared with other LNO HTL devices, the device based on LNO-2 film has a higher Rrec value due to the greater reduction in defect-assisted traps at the interface, which would facilitate the suppression of charge recombination.
To characterize the leakage current resulting from carrier recombination in the solar cells, dark current analyses were carried out (Fig. S7d, ESI†). The suppressed current in the dark of the device indicates that LNO-2 has significantly alleviated carrier recombination compared to the other LNO samples. Based on the above analyses, LNO-2HTL is proven to have efficient charge transport and collection abilities, which are very favorable for the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding PSCs.
To further improve the efficiency of LNO-based PSCs, a passivation layer (2PACz) was inserted between the LNO and perovskite layers. (Fig. 3c where the detailed photovoltaic parameters of devices with LNO-2 and LNO-2/2PACz are shown in the inset). We suppose that the improved performance is partially due to the improved energy-level alignment (Fig. S8, ESI†), suppressed interfacial recombination and facilitated hole extraction by the LNO-2/2PACz interface.28 Based on the optimized LNO/2PACz interface, the best PCE of 17.15% was achieved with a typical FA0.4MA0.6PbI3 light-absorber. The J–V curve and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the corresponding PSC are given in Fig. 3c and Fig. S9 (ESI†), respectively. Considering the superior UV screening characteristics of the LNO film, we also tested the UV stability of the device (Fig. 3d). The LNO-based devices could retain about 70% of their initial efficiency after 250 hours of continuous UV irradiation. While devices based on LNO/2PACz showed significantly improved UV stability, retaining about 85% of their initial efficiency after 400 hours of continuous UV irradiation. In comparison, the NiOx-based devices kept only 52% of their initial efficiency after 100 hours of continuous UV irradiation. To find the underlying mechanism for this superiority of LNO films, UV-stability tests were carried out on perovskite films deposited on LNO, LNO with 2PACz and NiOx films, respectively (Fig. S10, ESI†). As observed, the perovskite film based on LNO/2PACz demonstrates the highest UV stability. The NiOx sample shows the lowest performance. These results suggest that the LNO/perovskite interface is more stable than its NiOx counterpart under UV-irradiation, enabling the excellent UV-stability of the corresponding photovoltaic devices.
In summary, an inorganic LNO film was successfully prepared by a low-temperature solution-processing method and used as an HTL for fabricating inverted PSCs for the first time. The as-prepared PSC demonstrates a PCE of 14.39%, which was further improved to 17.15% by introducing 2PACz as a passivation layer at the LNO/perovskite interface. The LNO-based PSCs show excellent UV-stability where about 85% of the initial PCE can be maintained after 400 hours of continuous UV irradiation (8 W m−2), which is much higher than for their NiOx-counterparts. Our findings demonstrate that LNO could be a promising alternative hole-transport material for efficient and photostable PSCs.
