    , Accepted 21st April 2013First published on 22nd April 2013AbstractThe work-function of MoS2 interfacial layers can be efficiently modulated by p- and n-doping treatments. As a result, the PCE of devices with a p-doped MoS2-based HTL is increased from ∼2.8 to ∼3.4%. Particularly, after n-doping the PCE was dramatically increased due to the change in work-function compared with un-doped MoS2 thin-films.
Atomically thin 2-dimensional (2-D) nanosheets of layered transition metal dichalcogenides such as niobium disulfide (NbS2), tungsten disulfide (WS2), and molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) have attracted immense interest in recent years due to their superior mechanical, thermal, and electronic properties that are acceptable for a variety of feasible applications in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs), and polymer solar cells (PSCs).1–4 Recently, the possibility of obtaining MoS2 by exfoliation of multi-layered MoS2 into single-layered MoS2 nanosheets, followed by a Li-intercalation and exfoliation method,5,6 has allowed the solution-based production and thin-film fabrication of MoS2 sheets that are applicable in high-performance electronics. In addition, a high in-plane carrier mobility of ∼200 to 500 cm2 V−1 s−1 and superior mechanical properties of the MoS2 nanosheets have made them a promising material for various applications in electronic devices.1,3,7,8 Due to these versatile properties, many researchers have been intensely investigating the utilization of MoS2 as a semiconducting channel material for high-performance unipolar or ambipolar field-effect transistors.1,9–12 However, to date, only a few approaches for utilizing MoS2 as an interfacial layer in organic electronic devices have been reported despite its excellent electronic properties.2,4 This might be due to slight inherent deficiencies such as an ambiguous work-function (WF) value of MoS2 when used as hole or electron transport layers2,4,13 and to the inhomogeneous and aggregated morphology of a spin-cast MoS2 thin-film,4,14 which can induce poor carrier transport via non-ohmic contact or a WF mismatch between an electrode and organic materials and can also induce a small shunt resistance (Rsh) caused by a loss of charge carriers and carrier recombination and trapping in poor films, resulting in poor device performance for PSCs.15,16
To solve the above problems, G. L. Frey et al. used a dip-coating technique to make even and full-covered MoS2 thin-films and a further oxidation treatment under a high vacuum environment to reduce the hole injection barrier of the MoS2 thin-film in PLEDs.2 In addition, S. Kato et al. used an ultraviolet treatment and a special indium tin oxide (ITO) to form an ohmic contact and to create uniform and full-covered MoS2 thin-films, respectively.4 However, although they have successfully demonstrated the possibility of utilizing the MoS2 thin-film as an interfacial layer in organic electronic devices, the methods employed, such as dip-coating, oxidation treatment, ultraviolet process, etc., could be incompatible with the simple and fast production of organic electronic devices.17–20 Thus, a more facile and novel approach is desirable to form an ohmic contact by modulating the WF of the MoS2 thin-film and to produce uniform and full-covered MoS2 thin-films.
As a possible method for modulating the WF of interfacial layers, p- or n-doping treatments are often utilized in organic electronic fields, leading to a considerably decreased barrier-height of the charge transport and thus improving device characteristics.21–23 These approaches have been widely used for controlling the WF of graphene by using gold chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O) as a p-doping agent, which has resulted in a dramatic change in the WFs from ∼4.6 to ∼5.2 eV.22 In addition, reductants including alkali metals have been used as n-doping agents to decrease the WF of transparent electrodes and to reduce the electron-transport barrier height for use as an electron transport layer in organic electronic devices.23 However, there have been no reports on the WF modulations of solution-processed 2-D materials by p- or n-doping, with the exception of graphene.24 Furthermore, even though it was reported that a graphene-based film morphology can be easily tunable by the introduction of oxygen or various functional groups into pristine graphene sheets,16,25 there has been no such approach for preparing uniform and full-covered MoS2 thin-films via spin-coating, nor for utilizing them as interfacial layers in organic electronic devices. Thus, it remains a big challenge to control the WF and film morphology of solution-processed MoS2 thin-films in order to make them more useful as interfacial layers to achieve high-performance device applications.
In this communication, we report a simple but efficient method for preparing a solution-processed, uniform, and full-covered MoS2 thin-film and for modulating the WF of MoS2 by p- or n-doping treatments. As a consequence, the WFs (4.36–4.52 eV) of single-layered and un-doped MoS2 thin-films, featuring a homogeneous and full-covered morphology, can be efficiently tuned ranging from ∼3.5 to 4.8 eV through p-doping or n-doping treatments. Based on this observation, we have further demonstrated the utility of solution-processed thin-films fabricated with un-, p-, and n-doped MoS2 for use as novel anode and cathode interfacial layers in polymer solar cells. For conventional PSCs with a normal structure (n-PSCs) based on un-doped MoS2-based hole transport layers (HTLs), slightly lower open-circuit voltages (Voc) of 0.43–0.55 V and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of ∼1.7 to 2.8% were obtained due to mismatched WFs between MoS2 and the active layer. However, compared with previous results,4 the cell-performances were higher than those of most cells with MoS2 HTLs due to more full-covered and uniform film morphology. Interestingly, in the case of cells with a p-doped MoS2 HTL, the PCE was increased to ∼3.4% in n-PSCs. More importantly, by comparison with un-doped MoS2 thin-films used as electron transport layers (ETLs) in inverted PSCs (i-PSCs), the PCEs of cells with n-doped MoS2 ETLs were dramatically increased from 0.25 to 2.73%, reflecting that the interfacial properties of the MoS2 thin-films were effectively modulated from hole- to electron-extraction. These results demonstrate that, compared with the previous report,4 solution-processed un-doped MoS2 films show greater utility as a HTL due to greater uniformity and full-coverage film morphology despite a slightly mismatched WF value. Furthermore, simple and efficient MoS2/organic interface engineering by controlled p- or n-doping treatments led to a great improvement in cell-performances, indicating that the strategy demonstrated in the present study is a promising method to transform carrier extraction properties and to extend the device applicability of already-developed interfacial materials in n- and i-PSCs.
To evaluate the structural and electronic properties of the MoS2 nanosheets, we investigated several analyses such as UV-vis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). First, in order to investigate the chemical composition of the MoS2 sheets, as-deposited and annealed samples, each at 150 and 250 °C, were characterized by XPS analysis, as shown in Fig. 1a. Compared with as-deposited and annealed samples, the XPS spectra showed progressively stronger and narrower Mo4+ 3d3/2, Mo4+ 3d5/2, S 2p1/2, and S 2p3/2 peaks at 232, 229, 163, and 162 eV, respectively, suggesting that phase transformation occurred from a metastable octahedral (1T-MoS2) to a stable trigonal prismatic (2H-MoS2) structure.2,4,6,14 Structural transformation results can also be supported by variances in the UV-vis spectra, as shown in Fig. S1.†14 Furthermore, additional 1T peaks shown in the pristine MoS2 sample had gradually disappeared after annealing at 150 °C, which matches well with the previous result.14 Besides the dominant oxidation states of the MoS2 material such as Mo4+ and S2−, we have observed the Mo6+ peaks at 233.1 and 236.1 eV, indicating a partial oxidation of the MoS2 thin-film during a Li-intercalation/exfoliation process.4,6,14 This result coincides with our synthetic strategy for controlling the film morphology,6,16,25 and thus improving device characteristics including Rsh and FF in PSCs, which are highly influenced by coverage and uniformity of the interfacial layers.15,16

(b) The AFM image of the exfoliated MoS2 thin-film fabricated by a spin-coating process and the corresponding height profile along the black line. The scan size and z-range in the AFM image are 2 μm and 10 nm, respectively. (c) The UPS spectra of the un-doped MoS2 thin-films without and with annealment each at 150 and 250 °C. 

Fig. 1b and S1† show the AFM image of the MoS2 sheets prepared using the Li-intercalation and exfoliation methods.14 From the AFM images, we can confirm that the MoS2 nanosheets had a thickness of ∼1.1 to 1.2 nm and a lateral dimension of ∼100 to 300 nm, which is consistent with previously reported values for a single-layered MoS2 film where the film was prepared using a vacuum filtration/transfer method.14 In addition, we can also observe that the single-layered and nearly full-covered MoS2 thin-films can be sufficiently obtained through a simple spin-coating process, unlike those previously reported for MoS2 thin-films where spin-cast MoS2 nanosheets aggregated during deposition and drying.4 This observation may be explained by the possibility that a slightly oxidized molybdenum component resulted in the formation of a uniform and nearly full-covered MoS2 thin-film, as shown in the previous experimental result.6
The WF value of an interfacial material is a critically important factor for yielding high-performance PSCs.4,15 Thus, the UPS analyses of as-prepared and annealed MoS2 thin-films were investigated, and the corresponding WF values are summarized in Table S1.† Compared with the pristine MoS2 sample (WF = 4.36 eV), the WF of MoS2 thin-films was increased by 4.52 eV after annealing treatment at either 150 or 250 °C, as shown in Fig. 1c. These results could be explained by the XPS result that structural transformation from 1T to 2H-MoS2 triggered by thermal treatment resulted in the WF change.14 From AFM and UPS results, while uniform and nearly full-covered MoS2 thin-films were easily fabricated by a simple solution process, they were not suitable for use as interfacial layers due to WF values that were slightly mismatched with both a donor polymer such as poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and an acceptor such as phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). Therefore, it is believed that an additional modification is needed to tune the WF of the MoS2 thin-film in order to employ MoS2 thin-films as either hole or electron extraction layers in PSCs.
As a facile and efficient method for modulating the WF values of 2-D materials, a doping process has been utilized in electronic and optoelectronic fields.26–29 In particular, since the WF of the 2-D nanomaterial could be easily controllable by this technique, we investigated the effects that p- and n-doping would exert on the electronic properties, the sheet resistance, and the chemical composition of MoS2 thin-films. To tune the WF of the MoS2 films and thereby utilize the versatility of these hole or electron transport layers in organic photovoltaic devices, we used HAuCl4·3H2O and NaBH4 to p- and n-dope the MoS2 thin-films, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2 and S2–S4,† we measured the UPS, XPS, and sheet resistance in order to find evidence for the doping of the MoS2 thin-films treated with Au- or Na-based dopants of different concentrations. In the UPS results shown in Fig. 2a, a clear trend was observed as follows: when p-doped with HAuCl4, the WF of the MoS2 thin-films was increased to 4.76 eV, compared with that of the un-doped MoS2 film (4.52 eV), indicating that the effective WF modulation of the MoS2 thin-film was readily manipulated through solution-processed p-doping.22,29 In addition, we found that the binding energies of Mo 3d peaks in Au-doped MoS2 films were all downshifted with respect to the un-doped MoS2 thin-films, as shown in Fig. 2c and d, indicating that p-doping occurred successfully.30 To find more evidence for p-doping, we investigated the electrical properties of the MoS2 film. It is well-known that un-doped MoS2 obtained from the Li-intercalation/exfoliation method has p-type properties.6 HAuCl4 treatment can increase the p-type characteristics of MoS2 due to an additional hole doping effect, thus resulting in a decrease in the sheet resistance.22,29 In fact, as shown in Fig. S2,† all samples exhibited lower sheet resistance values compared with those of un-doped MoS2, indicating that the significant decrease in sheet resistance can be attributed to the p-doping effect, which also coincides with the previous report.22,29

To reveal the reasons for the change in the WF of the p-doped MoS2 films in detail, we investigated the XPS Au 4f and Cl 2p spectra. In Fig. 2e and S3a, the resultant spectra of HAuCl4-doped MoS2 films featured a distinct gold peak, and the intensity increased with increasing dopant concentrations, revealing that the doping level was controllable by simply changing the dopant concentration. To further investigate the oxidation or reduction states of Au components formed on MoS2 sheets, deconvolution of each spectrum in the Au 4f was conducted. As a result, a doublet Au peak, with binding energies of 84.2 and 87.8 eV, can be clearly seen in Fig. 2e, which is characteristic for Au0 4f7/2 and Au0 4f5/2.31 On the other hand, there was no Au3+ peak at ∼85 and ∼89 eV, implying that all Au ions were reduced to Au0.31 Besides the formation of Au nanoparticles, we can confirm the spontaneously produced MoO3,6 as shown in Fig. 2c. In particular, with an increase in the concentration of the p-dopant, the intensity of MoO3 was increased. Additionally, we can observe the adsorbed Cl peaks at ∼198.8 and ∼200.1 eV, which is indicative of Cl 2p3/2 and Cl 2p1/2, respectively (see Fig. S4a†). In particular, when considering that Cl ions can also p-dope MoS2 films due to the strong electronegativity of Cl,31 the WF modulation in p-doped MoS2 films was believed to be attributable to the formation of Au nanoparticles, MoO3, and adsorbed Cl ions on the sheets, as confirmed by XPS results.
Based on the above observations, the doping mechanism might be explained by the electron transfer reaction from MoS2 to gold dopant. It is well known that HAuCl4 in solvent is easily converted to AuCl4− ion in a similar manner to AuCl3.31 In particular, considering that HAuCl4 has a positive reduction potential, it has a great tendency to accept electrons from other materials, indicating that the reduction process of Au3+ to Au0 had occurred spontaneously.29 At a high concentration of the p-dopant, more electrons are needed to reduce gold ions, and thus Mo4+ was further converted into Mo6+, resulting in the formation of Au nanoparticles and MoO3 on the nanosheets (see Fig. 2c and S3a†).
In the case of n-doped MoS2 films, a distinct singlet Na band and a weak B peak with binding energies of ∼1072 and ∼194 eV are observed in Fig. 2f, S3b and S4b,† respectively,32,33 which is indicative of Na 1s and boron oxide complexes (BxOy) ascribed from NaBH4 as an n-dopant.23 In addition, the intensities of the Na peak increased with the increasing dopant concentrations, indicating that controllable doping is possible, as shown in Fig. S3b.† As revealed in Fig. S4b,† the intensity of boron oxide complexes was very low in all samples compared with those of Na 1s. In addition, considering that alkali compounds are widely used as efficient electron-transport materials in PSCs,34–36 it is believed that Na is the main component for tuning WFs of MoS2. To gather evidence for n-doping, we also investigated UPS, XPS, and sheet resistance of the MoS2 thin-films treated with different NaBH4 concentrations, as shown in Fig. 2b and d and S2.† As a result, all consequences of UPS, XPS, and sheet resistance of NaBH4-treated MoS2 were the reverse of the p-doped case, confirming that the MoS2 film was efficiently n-doped by NaBH4 treatment,28,30,31 which is consistent with the report on NaBH4 as an efficient n-type dopant in an organic device.23
Another factor influencing the performance of PSCs is the surface morphology of the MoS2-based interfacial layer, which is critically important for obtaining a high fill factor (FF), shunt resistance (Rsh), and PCE.15,16 Thus, we conducted AFM measurements of un-, p-, and n-doped MoS2 interfacial layers, as shown in Fig. 3, and the corresponding rms roughness values are summarized in Table S2.† In Fig. 3a, un-doped MoS2 films all showed very similar surface morphologies and uniform surface, which was probably due to the unique characteristics of 2D nanomaterials such as ultra-thin and planar structures.37 In particular, these observations are different from those reported for MoS2-based films spin-cast onto ITO/glass substrates where insufficient coverage and aggregated morphologies of MoS2 films were easily observed and thus, resulted in lower Voc values caused by poor carrier blocking properties and decrease in Rsh.4

After a doping process, a clear trend in the surface morphology was observed in the p- and n-doped MoS2 films as follows: with increasing dopant concentrations, a distinct increase in the size of Au particles and the amount of NaBH4 deposited onto the MoS2 film was clearly observed, as shown in Fig. 3b and c, respectively. In detail, for 10 mM HAuCl4 and 0.01 M NaBH4 films, homogeneous surface morphologies with rms roughness values of less than 1.4 nm were observed due to a moderate dopant concentration. For higher doping, we observed a much larger Au particle and a severely aggregated NaBH4 cluster in the MoS2 films. On the other hand, 1 mM HAuCl4 and 0.006 M NaBH4 films all showed surface morphologies and rms roughness values that were similar to those of un-doped MoS2 films. As a result, the values for rms roughness of un-, p-, and n-doped MoS2 thin-films all were less than 1.4 nm except for 20 mM HAuCl4 (2.27 nm) and 0.1 M NaBH4 (2.63 nm). From these overall results, we can directly confirm the doping effect on the PSC performance, considering that, with the exception of 20 mM HAuCl4 and 0.1 M NaBH4, un-doped and doped MoS2 film samples all showed similar and uniform morphologies and rms roughness values but had quite different WFs. In addition, the effects of MoS2 film morphology on the cell-performance can also be confirmed by comparing 20 mM HAuCl4 and 0.1 M NaBH4-treated samples with other doped MoS2 films.
To directly investigate the effects of the aforementioned film morphology and doping on device characteristics and thus to directly evaluate the feasibility and potential of un-, p-, and n-doped MoS2 as hole or electron transport layers, n- or i-PSCs based on P3HT:PCBM were fabricated. The MoS2-based buffer layers were spin-coated onto ITO/glass substrates and varied in annealing temperatures, doping agents, and dopant concentrations. As previously confirmed by the AFM analysis in Fig. 1b, the thickness of the un-doped MoS2 film was approximately 1.1–1.2 nm. Fig. 4 shows the representative current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells incorporating various interfacial layers, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. First, we investigated whether three kinds of un-doped MoS2 thin-films act as hole or electron transport layers. Compared with the un-doped and pristine MoS2-based HTL in n-PSCs, with an increase in annealing temperature, the Voc was slightly increased from 0.43 to 0.55 V, as shown in Fig. 4c, which is consistent with the UPS result of Fig. 1c. In particular, due to uniform and full-covered film morphology, cell-performances were higher than those of most cells with MoS2-based HTLs in the previous report.4 When the same un-doped MoS2 films were used as an ETL in i-PSCs, all devices showed highly poor performances regardless of their annealing temperatures, probably due to the p-type semiconducting properties of the prepared MoS2 films (see Fig. 4d).6,38

On the other hand, device performances were all improved by p- or n-doping treatments on MoS2 thin-films compared to cells with un-doped MoS2 as a HTL and an ETL, respectively. In particular, a dramatically enhanced performance (∼3.4%) was demonstrated by doping MoS2 with 10 mM HAuCl4 in n-PSCs, as shown in Fig. 4e. More surprisingly, compared with cells with un-doped MoS2 as an ETL in i-PSCs, the device with n-doped MoS2 films treated by 0.01 M NaBH4 exhibited greatly enhanced performance characteristics: The PCE, FF, Jsc, and Voc of cells with un- and n-doped MoS2 as ETLs were 0.25 and 2.73%, 26.86 and 55.01%, 5.58 and 8.16 mAcm−2, and 0.17 and 0.61 V, respectively (see Fig. 4f). Considering that the cells with 10 mM HAuCl4- or 0.01 M NaBH4-doped MoS2 films showed a surface morphology that was similar to that of un-doped cells, but had different WF values, it is believed that WF matching between electrodes and active layers and an ohmic contact formation by doping processes resulted in enhanced PCEs.15,39 However, cells with a concentration lower than 10 mM HAuCl4 and 0.01 M NaBH4 exhibited slightly lower Voc and PCE values due to mismatched WFs, considering the UPS results discussed in Fig. 2.15,39 By contrast, although the changed WF values were sufficient to form ohmic contacts between electrode/organic interfaces and thus to yield sufficient Voc values, cells with doping concentrations higher than 10 mM HAuCl4 and 0.01 M NaBH4 showed lower FF values of 62.54 and 42.92%, respectively, probably due to inhomogeneous films with high rms roughness values, as shown in Fig. 3 and Table S2.†15,16 From these overall results, it can be confirmed that p- or n-doping processes are efficient ways to tune the WFs and buffer properties of an MoS2 interfacial layer. In addition, homogeneous film morphology and adequate doping concentration are important factors for an efficient interfacial layer leading to high-performance n- and i-PSCs.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully prepared a solution-processed, single-layered, and full-covered MoS2 thin-film via a simple spin-coating method and further demonstrated that the WFs of un-doped MoS2 films can be efficiently modulated by p- and n-doping processes. From the XPS, UPS, and sheet resistance results, the reason for p-doping is attributed to Au nanoparticles, adsorbed Cl ions, and MoO3 species in the sheet, and the Na atom from NaBH4 plays a crucial role in the n-doping of the MoS2 thin-film. Un-, p-, and n-doped MoS2 thin-films were all investigated for applications as anode and cathode interfacial layers for high-performance PSCs. In particular, compared with an un-doped MoS2-based HTL in n-PSCs, enhanced performances were demonstrated by p-doping the MoS2 thin-film. More interestingly, after n-doping treatment, the PCE of a cell with an un-doped MoS2 ETL was dramatically enhanced from 0.25 to 2.73%, reflecting that carrier transport properties of the MoS2 film were efficiently altered from holes to electrons. These results clearly demonstrated that a simple and efficient WF modulation of the MoS2 interfacial layer through p- and n-doping is a useful method to tune hole/electron transport properties and to further open new avenues for the applicability of commonly used interfacial materials.
