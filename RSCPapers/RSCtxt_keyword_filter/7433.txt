    , Accepted 27th November 2022First published on 28th November 2022AbstractControlling and optimizing the photoactive layer morphology is closely related to the process of exciton dissociation, charge transfer and collection and thus is crucial for building a high-performance polymer solar cell (PSC). Due to the limited solubility of non-halogenated solvents and the strong crystallinity of Y6 acceptors, it is a challenge to optimize the morphology of the Y6-based blend active layer processed by a non-halogenated solvent for achieving a high photovoltaic performance. In this work, we develop a morphology controlling method by applying BTBT and DTBDT as solid additives to regulate the phase separation of the o-xylene-processed PM6:Y6 blend films. The strong crystalline behavior of BTBT and DTBDT can restrict the over-aggregation of Y6 molecules in a low volatility processing solvent during the film formation. The stronger crystallinity and better miscibility with Y6 of BTBT over DTBDT lead to a favorable effect in facilitating the formation of a nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating network in the PM6:Y6 active layer. As a result, the o-xylene-processed PM6:Y6-based PSC treated with BTBT and DTBDT additives shows an enhanced power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.37% and 14.40%, respectively, as compared to the control device (PCE = 10.25%) using 1-chloronaphthalene as a solvent additive.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been widely regarded as a promising solar energy technology due to their unique features of light weight, mechanical flexibility, semitransparency, and roll-to-roll processability.1–5 The photoactive layer of PSCs is a key component that converts the absorbed photons within its absorption region to charge carriers and determines the photovoltaic performance.6–11 Because of the short lifetime and diffusion length issues of excitons in organic semiconductors, controlling and regulating the photoactive layer morphology toward achieving nanoscale phase separation (10–20 nm) with bicontinuous donor/acceptor interpenetrating networks is a prerequisite for building a high-performance PSC.12–15 Due to the different crystalline and aggregation properties, it is difficult for donor and acceptor materials to spontaneously form well-developed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) phase separation. Therefore, solvent additives are widely used as key morphology-directing agents to control the aggregation of donor/acceptor materials during film formation.16–18 The key operating principles of this morphology controlling method are the selective solubility of a solvent additive for either a donor or an acceptor material, and the different volatilization between the solvent additive and the host solvent. During the period that fullerene derivatives are the dominant acceptors, solvent additives play a critical role in regulating the morphology towards achieving improved efficiency in PSCs because of the different features between fullerene derivatives and p-type semiconductors. Yet the outcomes of this strategy are significantly restricted in the nonfullerene acceptor-based photoactive layers, resulting from the fact that the nonfullerene acceptors have similar planar conjugated backbones to donors and strong crystallinity, which bring more complexity in restricting their over aggregation in a BHJ blend compared to fullerene derivatives.19–23
At present, halogenated solvents (e.g., chlorobenzene and chloroform) are the commonly used processing solvents to build high-performance PSCs, as they exhibit excellent solubility to the highly conjugated structures of organic semiconductors.24–26 Nevertheless, these solvents are highly toxic and harmful to the environment, and are not adaptable for large-scale PSC fabrication. The development of processing based on nonhalogenated solvents is widely recognized as an effective strategy to resolve this issue.24 The non-halogenated solvents are known to be less toxic and this can address the health- and cost-related concerns compared to their halogenated counterparts. Meanwhile, due to the strong aggregation of Y6-series molecules, chloroform is the widely used processing solvent in fabricating high-performance PSCs.27–32 This is because the fast evaporation of chloroform with a low boiling point can prevent over aggregation of Y6-series molecules during film formation. In contrast, a high boiling point processing solvent prolongs the process of the aggregation of Y6 that leads to over-size phase separation and thus poor photovoltaic performance.19 Additionally, the similar solubility of Y6-series molecules and donors in solvent additives gives rise to a critical challenge in regulating the morphology of halogenated solvent-processed active layers by the conventional solvent additive treatments. A feasible strategy to control the aggregation of Y6-series acceptors is applying volatilizable solid agents as additives.19–21,33 Due to the strong crystallinity of solid additives, the self-aggregation of acceptor molecules can be restricted during the film formation process, and then a well-developed nanoscale phase separation is established upon volatilizing the solid agents under thermal annealing. This treatment offers an effective approach to fine-tune the morphology of the non-halogenated solvent Y6-series acceptor-based active layer towards achieving highly efficient and environmentally friendly PSCs.
In spite of the attractive outcomes achieved in the solid additive-assisted morphology optimization, the operating principle of this approach is still under further exploitation. For instance, the effect of miscibility, crystallinity, and volatility of solid additives on morphology optimization is unclear. To address these issues, two analogues, benzo[b]benzo[4,5]thieno[2,3-d]thiophene (BTBT) and dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDT) (as shown in Fig. 1(a)) with different crystallinities were used as solid additives to exploit their effect in regulating the morphology of the non-halogenated solvent processed active layer of the PSCs. In comparison with the conventional treatment using 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as a solvent additive, the additional solid additive of BTBT or DTBDT coordinated with CN effectively facilitated phase separation with a well-developed nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating network in the non-halogenated solvent o-xylene-processed PM6:Y6 (Fig. 1(a)) blend film. On the other hand, the different crystallinity intensity between the two solid additives resulted in different effects that restrict the over self-aggregation of the Y6 molecule in the o-xylene-processed blend film, and thus much different photovoltaic performance was obtained in the devices.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Volatility and crystallinity
The volatility of BTBT and DTBDT was investigated by the thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) measurement. As shown in Fig. S1a in the ESI,† BTBT shows a weight loss starting from 110 °C with a decomposition temperature with 5% weight loss (Td) at approximately 210 °C (a scan rate of 10 °C min−1). By holding the temperature at 110 and 130 °C for 2 h, BTBT was clearly volatilized, and there is no residue remaining in the crucible upon holding the temperature at 200 °C for 2 h (as shown in Fig. S1b in the ESI†). Relative to BTBT, a higher Td at approximately 274 °C was observed for DTBDT, suggesting the better thermal stability of DTBDT. Although a weight loss appeared at 110 °C in the TGA plot of DTBDT, a very small amount of weight loss (ca. 3% weight loss) was observed even holding the temperature at 170 °C for 2 h. The volatilization of DTBDT bulks is accelerated till the temperature reached over 300 °C, leaving black solids with the temperature raised to over 350 °C (Fig. S1b in the ESI†). The result suggests that BTBT is more volatilizable compared to DTBDT. We then performed spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements to further confirm the volatility of BTBT and DTBDT. As shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI,† the BTBT film was completely volatilized after thermal annealing (TA) at 110 °C for 10 min, suggesting the volatilization of BTBT. In contrast, 85% of the original film thickness of DTBDT was still maintained after TA at 130 °C for 10 min.
The crystallinity of solid additives is the critical property to restrict the over self-aggregation of photovoltaic materials towards nanoscale phase separation. Therefore, the crystallinity of BTBT and DTBDT was studied by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements. As shown in Fig. 1(b), BTBT has a melting temperature (Tm) at approximately 213 °C, while DTBDT exhibits a higher Tm at 295 °C. The melting enthalpy was calculated to be 124.23 J g−1 for BTBT, which is larger than that of DTBDT (95.39 J g−1), indicating that the stronger crystallinity of BTBT than that of DTBDT.
2.2 Miscibility
The miscibility of two solid additives with the PM6 donor and the Y6 acceptor was investigated by evaluating the surface energy (γ) via measuring the contact angles on water and ethylene glycol (EG).34 As shown in Fig. S3 and Table S1 (ESI†), γ was measured to be 50.44 mN m−1 for BTBT, 38.91 mN m−1 for DTBDT, 29.64 mN m−1 for PM6, and 48.37 mN m−1 for Y6. Then, the blend miscibility was estimated by the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χ), which was calculated by the equation .35 The χ parameter is calculated to be 0.022 for the Y6:BTBT blend and 0.514 for the Y6:DTBDT blend, which are much lower than those of the PM6:BTBT blend (χ = 2.748) and the PM6:DTBDT (χ = 0.629) blend, respectively (Table S2 in the ESI†). The results imply that BTBT and DTBDT have better miscibility with Y6 as compared to PM6. Therefore, the solid additive mainly impacts the aggregation of Y6 rather than PM6 during the film formation process. And, the χ parameter of the Y6:BTBT blend is lower than that of the Y6:DTBDT blend, implying that the BTBT has better miscibility with the Y6 acceptor than that of DTBDT. This can be further confirmed by the atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the Y6:DTBDT blend film shows a relatively rough surface with a root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of 3.49 nm, while a smaller Rq of 0.84 nm was observed in the Y6:BTBT blend film. The smaller Rq value should be resulted from the better misibility of the two components.
2.3. Application of BTBT and DTBDT as solid additives in PSCs
The effect of BTBT and DTBDT as solid additives in regulating the photovoltaic performance of PSCs was investigated by fabricating the devices using a conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:Y6/PDINO/Al, with the non-halogenated solvent o-xylene as the processing solvent, and the detailed experimental procedures are described in the ESI.† The o-xylene-processed PM6:Y6-based device using conventional treatments of CN additives was also fabricated as a reference. Fig. 2(a) shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized PSCs with different treatments under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1.

The conventional treatment of 0.5% CN (v/v) additive and TA at 110 °C for the o-xylene-processed PM6:Y6-based device yielded a moderate power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.25%, with an opencircuit voltage (Voc) of 0.789 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.62 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.663, which are consistent with our previous report.19 Then, the solid additive of BTBT and DTBDT was used to examine their effect in tuning the morphology of the o-xyleneprocessed PM6:Y6 blend film by loading various ratios, respectively. As shown in Table S3 in the ESI,† the co-additives of 20% BTBT (w/w, relative to PM6) and 0.5% (v/v) CN associated with TA at 110 °C for 10 min led to a significantly higher PCE of 15.06% compared to the CN additive treatment alone. The significant improvement of PCE is mainly due to the improved Jsc of 25.56 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.747. The Jsc and FF were further improved upon increasing the ratio of BTBT to 25%, and thus a higher PCE of 15.42% was obtained. A maximum PCE of 16.37% was achieved by using 30% BTBT as an additive, with a Voc of 0.811 V, a Jsc of 26.14 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.773. A further increment of the BTBT content led to a poorer photovoltaic performance of the device (Table S3 in the ESI†). The device performance is sensitive to the TA temperature, and the optimal TA temperature is determined to be 110 °C for 10 min (Table S4 in the ESI†). It is worth noting that a notable PCE of 15.68% can be achieved in the PM6:Y6-based device that solely used BTBT as an additive (Table S5 in the ESI†).
A similar tendency of photovoltaic performance was observed in the o-xylene-processed PM6:Y6-based device by using DTBDT as a co-additive with CN. Relative to the treatment using CN as an additive, loading the DTBDT content from 20% to 30% effectively improved the photovoltaic properties of the devices (Table S6 in the ESI†), and the highest PCE of 14.40% was achieved by using 30% DTBDT as a solid additive and TA at 130 °C for 10 min, with a Voc of 0.798 V, a Jsc of 25.28 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.714. On the other hand, changing the TA temperature led to poorer photovoltaic performance (Table S7 in the ESI†). A lower PCE of 12.18% and 10.75% was obtained upon increasing the DTBDT content to 40% and 50%, respectively (Table S6 in the ESI†). Due to the lower Jsc and FF values, the PCE of 14.40% obtained in the optimal DTBDT-treated device is lower than that of the device using BTBT as an additive (PCE = 16.37%, Table 1). Apparently, applying BTBT and DTBDT as solid additives is in favor of enhancing the FF and Jsc (Fig. 2(b)) values, and thus enabling much higher PCEs (Fig. 2(c)).
External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed to confirm the Jsc values of the devices. Fig. 2(d) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the PM6:Y6-based devices with different treatments. In comparison with the reference device using CN as an additive, the application of BTBT and DTBDT as solid additives significantly enhanced the EQE values in the wavelength range of 350–850 nm, and the maximum EQE value was increased from 55% to over 75%, respectively, indicating the enhancement of photo-to-current efficiency. To clarify the enhancement of Jsc values, we measured the absorption spectra of the PM6:Y6-based films with different treatments (Fig. S4 in the ESI†). It is observed that the absorbance of the PM6:Y6 blend is effectively enhanced upon using BTBT or DTBDT as a solid additive, indicating the improved light-harvesting capability that contributes to obtaining higher Jsc values. All of the integrated currents obtained from the EQE spectra were consistent with those obtained by the J–V measurements.
2.4. Charge transport properties
The improved PCE of the o-xyleneprocessed devices with the treatment of BTBT and DTBDT solid additives is mainly due to the improved FF and Jsc parameters. In a PSC, the FF and Jsc parameters are closely relative to the charge carrier transport and recombination properties. Therefore, we preliminarily measured the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobility of the devices by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (detailed experimental procedures are provided in the ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. S5 in the ESI,† the reference device treated by the CN solvent additive showed a μh of 2.85 × 10−4 and a μe of 7.73 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. The charge transport properties of the devices are effectively improved by using BTBT and DTBDT as solid additives to treat the blend film. The DTBDT and CN-treated blend films showed a μh of 3.28 × 10−4 and a higher μe of 2.30 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, and using BTBT as an additive further elevates the μh and μe to be 4.23 × 10−4 and 3.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.

(d) Light-intensity dependence of Voc of the PM6:Y6-based devices. 
Then, we plotted the curves of photocurrent density Jph (Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD represent the light and dark current densities, respectively) versus the effective voltage (Veff) of the devices to investigate the exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) of the devices.36 As shown in Fig. 3(b), Pdiss of the devices using BTBT and DTBDT as additives was obtained to be 99.2% and 98.0%, respectively, which are higher than that of the device treated with the CN solvent additive (Pdiss = 93.9%), suggesting the positive effect of the solid additive of BTBT and DTBDT in improving the exciton dissociation of PM6:Y6 blend films. The transient photocurrent (TPC) measurement results suggested that the addition of BTBT and DTBDT is beneficial to shorten the charge extraction time from 0.733 μs of the CN-processed blend film to 0.602 and 0.445 μs, respectively (as shown in Fig. 3(c)). Additionally, the dual additive treatment using CN + BTBT (τ = 2.46 μs) and CN + DTBDT (τ = 2.14 μs) favors prolonging the lifetime of charge carriers with regard to τ of 1.43 μs for the reference device processed by the CN additive, as revealed by the photovoltage (TPV) transient measurements (as shown in Fig. S6 in the ESI†). According to the plotting curve of light intensity (Plight) dependence of Jsc (Jsc ∝ Pαlight, where α is an exponential factor that should be equal to 1 if all carriers are swept out before recombination), the dual treatment of BTBT + CN and DTBDT + CN led to a higher α value of 0.972 and 0.961 than the device using CN as an additive (α = 0.959) (Fig. 3(d)). The results indicate the positive effect of solid additives in suppressing the bimolecular recombination of the devices and the result of BTBT is more pronounced. Apparently, the application of BTBT and DTBDT as solid additives is in favor of improving the charge transport and extraction efficiency and suppressing the bimolecular recombination of the PM6:Y6-based device, favoring higher Jsc and FF values.
2.5. Morphology characterization
We performed DSC measurement to investigate the effect of BTBT and DTBDT in restricting the aggregation of Y6 molecules. As shown in Fig. S7 in the ESI,† the characteristic peak of Y6 is replaced by new endothermic peaks with much lower enthalpy in the BTBT:Y6 and DTBDT:Y6 mixtures, indicating that BTBT and DTBDT can effectively suppress the crystallization of Y6.
To clarify the effect of the two solid additives on the morphology, we carried out AFM and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements to study the surface and bulk morphologies of the blend film, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 4(a), the reference o-xyleneprocessed PM6:Y6 blend film treated with the CN additive showed a rough surface with a large Rq of 11.80 nm, which is mainly due to the strong crystallinity of Y6 molecules and the limitation of the CN additive in restricting its over aggregation in the o-xylene solvent. By using BTBT and DTBDT as additives, the surface roughness of the blend film was significantly ameliorated, resulting in a much smaller Rq of 1.15 and 1.88 nm, respectively. Additionally, relative to the CN-additive treated PM6:Y6 blend with excessive phase separation, the phase separation was effectively fine-tuned to be a well-developed nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating network with a clear nano-fiber structure by using BTBT and DTBDT as additives, and the effect is more pronounced in the BTBT-treated blend film (Fig. 4(b)). Such improved morphological properties in the BHJ blend are in favor of realizing more efficient exciton dissociation and better charge transport properties, contributing to the higher Jsc and FF values of the devices.
 Fig. 4  (a) The AFM topography images and (b) TEM images of the o-xyleneprocessed PM6:Y6 (1:1.2, w/w) blend films treated with different additives. 
It should be pointed out that devices treated with BTBT or DTBDT showed similar thermal stability to those treated with CN as the additive (as shown in Fig. S8 in the ESI†), even though BTBT and DTBDT started to evaporate under the conditions of 110 °C for 2 hours and 130 °C for 2 hours, respectively.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we developed a morphology controlling method by applying BTBT and DTBDT as solid additives to optimize the phase separation of o-xylene-processed PM6:Y6 blend films. The strong crystallinity of BTBT and DTBDT can restrict the over-aggregation of Y6 molecules in a low volatility processing solvent during the film formation. We performed comprehensive measurements to confirm that the solid additives BTBT and DTBDT have a favorable effect in facilitating the formation of a nanoscale bicontinuous interpenetrating network of the o-xylene-processed PM6:Y6 active layer, and the effect of the BTBT solid additive is more obvious, which is mainly due to its stronger crystallinity and better miscibility. As a result, the o-xylene-processed PM6:Y6 treated with CN and BTBT additives showed a notable PCE of 16.37%, which is much higher than that of the reference device treated with only CN as the additive. The significant improvement of the device is mainly due to the enhanced Jsc and FF, which benefit from the better morphological properties. The effect of the DTBDT solid additive in regulating the morphology of PM6:Y6 is decent but less than that of BTBT, delivering a lower PCE of 14.40%. Apparently, the morphology controlling method developed in this work can tackle the issue of over-aggregation of Y6 molecules in a high-boiling point non-halogenated solvent towards achieving optimal phase separation. This treatment offers an effective approach to fine-tune the morphology of the Y6-series-based active layer processed by a non-halogenated solvent, towards achieving highly efficient and environmentally friendly PSCs.
