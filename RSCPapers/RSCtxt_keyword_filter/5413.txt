1 Introduction
Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are organic assemblies that arrange themselves spontaneously on solid or liquid surfaces into crystalline (or semicrystalline) structures. The application of SAMs in microelectronics has gained significant attention in the past decade, with the drive towards miniaturisation in microelectronics as well as the advent of new surfaces such as graphene. SAMs provide a particularly convenient and flexible method of tailoring the properties of surfaces.
This review focuses on research conducted over the past decade and directed at self assembled monolayers formed on the most commonly studied metal surface, gold, and the newest, graphene. The high affinity of thiols for metal surfaces such as gold makes them the most widely studied of SAMs and the most utilised for electronic applications. They also have the desirable property that the chemical functionality can be altered with relative ease even after adsorption. They also benefit from a headgroup with a specific affinity to common metal substrates that will replace any adventitious material adsorbed on to the surface, resulting in a cleansing effect. There are many reviews on thiol SAMs1,2 and reviews on molecular electronics,3 and the references contained within provide an overview of the development of the field. This review aims to update these articles by consolidating research into thiols adsorbed on to gold undertaken during the last decade and further this by reviewing research of the use of other SAMs with graphene, the newest metallic surface over the past few years.
The following section reviews recent work on the adsorption mechanism of thiols on metal substrates, outlining the conflicting literature on the subject. Section 3 describes some of the electronic applications of thiols and highlights the focus of this work. Section 4 reviews the use of SAMs to functionalize graphene, a 2D honeycomb of carbon atoms.4
2 Mechanics of adsorption
This section takes a look at the adsorption process of thiols on gold. Thiols on gold are the most studied system in the literature due to their ability to easily form stable monolayers. There is a lot of interest in the underlying chemistry of SAM formation.5 In typical theoretical studies short chain alkanethiols are often chosen due to their simplicity. Studies on longer chain alkanethiols require consideration of the van der Waals forces between alkyl chains.
The structure of the molecule–metal interface is crucial for the understanding of the growth mechanisms of SAMs and of the electrostatic properties of these materials. The S–Au anchor bond is influential in the self-assembly process and resultant structure of a SAM, as well as the electronic properties of the molecule within the SAM.
When looking at the adsorption process when forming these SAMs there are four main considerations:
1. Chemisorption and physisorption.
2. Dissociative adsorption and S–H bond scission.
3. Adsorption site and orientation.
4. Influence of alkyl chain length.
There is a lot of conflicting literature on these points. The purpose of this review is to take a closer look at the work that has been done and try and identify the direction of the field at the present time.
2.1 Dissociative or non-dissociative adsorption?
It is widely accepted that when an alkanethiol adsorbs on to a metal substrate, that the S–H bond is cleaved. An alkanethiolate is formed to enable the S anchor group to form a strong bond with the substrate. However, this process is not fully understood. There is some ambiguity regarding what happens to the hydrogen after dissociation. In addition, there is also some suggestion that an alkanethiol could adsorb in molecular form (with the S–H bond remaining intact). There are two proposed explanations: (i) the thiol molecule is adsorbed, the S–H bond is cleaved and the hydrogen adsorbs to the substrate surface (ii) after the S–H bond scission the hydrogen desorbs in molecular form.
Lustemberg et al.5 investigated possible reaction pathways for the CH3S–H scission using density functional theory (DFT). The initial physisorption state is fairly well understood and is considered to be the precursor to the S–H scission. The study found that whilst the CH3S preferentially adsorbed at a bridge site, the dissociated H adsorbs at a hollow site. The relevance of the adsorption site will be discussed in the next section.
A study by Kankate et al.6 performed on aromatic thiols considered a different option. Kankate and co-workers used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to study the SAMs of these molecules. The authors found that the hydrogen released from the S–H bond scission reduced some of the terminal nitro groups into amino groups. A schematic of this process is shown in Fig. 1.

Although not generally considered, there is some evidence found in literature that supports non-dissociative adsorption. This evidence is highly controversial as it is commonly acknowledged in literature that the chemisorbed species is in radical form e.g. methanethiolate (CH3S). Non-dissociative adsorption was considered but disregarded by Cometto et al.7 as the authors believed it to be implausible. However, an investigation of methanethiol on silver was conducted using temperature programmed desorption (TDP) and found that it was in fact possible.8 An investigation in to methanethiol on gold was performed by Rzeźnicka et al.9 that also gives supporting evidence to non-dissociative adsorption. This study also used TDP to demonstrate that that no hydrogen was adsorbed to the gold surface and that the methanethiol (CH3SH) adsorbed on to the surface in its molecular form. Both TDP investigations were supported by Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES).
The coverage of the SAM and the size of the molecule may influence the chemisorption process. Upon comparison of these studies, no obvious points appear to have been overlooked.
2.2 Adsorption site
There is a lot of debate regarding the preferential site of adsorption for alkanethiols on gold. Historically the hollow site was generally considered the most energetically favourable site. Then, between 2000 and 2005, the theoretical studies performed often came to one of two conclusions, hollow10,11 or bridge.12,13 However, the majority of the recent theoretical work supports the notion that the bridge site is the most stable adsorption site. Since 2005 there has been another shift in opinion as experimental evidence14 and developments in theoretical models15,16 indicate that atop site adsorption could be another viable explanation.
Prior to this it was generally considered that the atop adsorption site was by far the least energetically favourable. Some of the investigations discussed in this article look at how this could be the case. Referring back to the question of dissociative or non-dissociative adsorption, one thing that some authors agree upon is that the molecular species preferentially adsorbs on an atop site and the thiolate species at a bridge sites. Numerous authors consider this in their view of how the mechanics work and have their own opinions on what this means and how this affects the system.5,7,17
The majority of the theory in this field is performed using the simplest alkanethiol system, methanethiol (CH3SH). This is due to the inability of DFT to accurately describe van der Waals interactions.
2.3 Bridge versus atop
Maksymovych and co-workers have performed substantial research into the adsorption mechanics of thiols on gold. In 2005 Maksymovych et al.14 published a paper that challenged the previously accepted knowledge that atop adsorption was the least favourable site for molecular adsorption to occur. The STM image shown in Fig. 2a of the SAM on Au(111) shows a potential six point rotation as shown in Fig. 2b. This would only be possible if the molecule was adsorbed at an atop site. If the molecule was adsorbed to a hollow site, three point rotations would be observed, and a bridge site would show two point rotations.

Maksymovych et al.18 performed a single molecule study to try and emulate theoretical conditions in an attempt to try and resolve some of the ambiguity surrounding the mechanics of adsorption. This investigation looked at methanethiolate and ethanethiolate. The parent molecules were exposed to STM tip-induced electron-impact dissociation to obtain the radical species. The STM images obtained indicate that the thiolate molecules adsorb at the bridge site. The DFT study performed confirmed what has been reported in prior literature; that the bridge site is the most energetically favourable. Based on the binding energies the preferential site for adsorption was bridge sites > hollow sites ≫ atop sites. These findings also agree that the atop site is significantly less favourable than the other adsorption sites. The comparison of STM images and theoretically produced images is given in Fig. 3. In addition, a comparison of numerous literature sources is given in Table 1, highlighting the degree of controversy within the field.

For a SAM, the large number of variables within the system makes calculating the potential energy surface (PES) difficult. Low coverage systems are simpler as the variables can be identified. However, there are additional considerations when dealing with high coverage systems: chain–chain interactions and interactions between tail groups of the alkanethiols affect the mechanics of the system. These calculations are therefore simpler for short chain alkanethiols which is why these are the most studied. But understanding of interactions between longer chain molecules is integral for the development of self-assembled monolayers and their applications.7
Cometto et al.7 investigated the potential energy surface (PES) of methanethiol and ethanethiol on Cu(111), Ag(111) and Au(111). The study found that for the adsorption of the radical species on all substrates, the most stable adsorption site was the bridge site > hollow site ≫ atop site as was also concluded by Maksymovych et al.18 Compared to the other substrates, gold has a lower stability when the methanethiolate is adsorbed with zero tilt (S–C bond perpendicular to the surface). This indicates that gold relies on the tilt of the bond in order to increase the stability compared to copper and silver.
It is proposed that a potential explanation for the conflicting DFT15,18,19 and experimental results14 could be due to the molecular species adsorbing rather than the radical form (i.e. no dissociation of hydrogen). Therefore, a DFT study was performed for the adsorption of molecular species was investigated on Au(111).
Interestingly, it appeared that the methanethiol (CH3SH) adsorbed via the sulphur atom at an atop site. However, a comparison of geometries with experimental values ruled out molecular adsorption as a viable explanation. Although temperature powered desorption (TPD) studies have shown that this is a possibility.8,9 The authors considered that the initial atop adsorption of the molecular species could influence packing during the SAM formation which could lead to atop adsorption of the radical species upon the scission of the S–H bond. Whether or not a fraction of the molecular species remains and influences the SAM is left open for debate.
Torrelles et al.17 performed a theoretical study based on the physisorption and chemisorption processes. Multiple theoretical models were investigated. The compliance (χ2) of the experimental versus model data related to the preferential adsorption site is given. Firstly coherent models for two-site were explored. However, χ2 values were greater than that of single-site models so these were disregarded. Upon comparison of experimental and theoretical data there appears to be good compliance for the proposed incoherent ‘two-site’ model.
As with all theoretical models some assumptions were made. In this instance to get best χ2 value S–Au distance was fixed. The validity of this assumption is left open to questioning. The ‘two-site’ model has greater number of parameters than other models but it is physically feasible. Although this model has some flaws it should be given due consideration before being dismissed. This model proposes an alternative model to try and resolve the discrepancies between experimental and theoretical data. The authors suggest that possible explanations for this could be related to the mechanisms of adsorption and the adsorption pathway. The physisorption phase prior to S–H bond scission (if this occurs at all) on to metal could be the key.
An interesting theoretical study of methanethiolate on Au(111) was performed by Mazzarello et al.20 The study concluded that there was co-occupation of atop and bridging sites. This model includes Au-adatom–dithiolate moieties (this is discussed in more detail in a later section) and involves a high degree of disorder.
The specifics of the relative coverage are that there is a 1:1 ratio of Au-adatom–dithiolate moieties and bridging thiolate species. This means that 2/3 of the S anchor bonds are on atop sites and the remaining 1/3 reside on bridging sites. The notion that there is a significant amount of occupation of the bridging sites is covered in previous theoretical calculations. However, this does not comply with the recent experimental data. The possibility of co-occupation of bridge and atop sites was not covered in earlier studies12,13 but in recent years the notion of a single site adsorption model has been challenged.17,20
Although there are benefits to looking at simplified alkanethiol systems, in practice longer chain alkanethiols are used for practical applications. A combined experimental and theoretical study determining the adsorption sites of octanethiolate was performed by Li et al.21 Unlike the results for short chain alkanethiols, this study showed a preference of adsorption to a hollow site. The compliance of experimental to theoretical data was best for the model in which roughly 75% of the thiolate molecules were adsorbed to hollow sites and the remaining 25% to bridge sites.
It was mentioned previously that the majority of theoretical studies find the bridge site to be the most energetically favourable. A paper was recently published by Jackson et al.22 in which the theoretical data fitted best when considering atop adsorption for a bulk SAM compared to alternative adsorption sites. This paper was a direct follow up from the work by Mazzarello and co-workers outlined previously and investigated the same system.
Jackson and co-workers found that normal incidence X-ray standing waves (NIXSW) and photoelectron diffraction (PhD) models independently found atop adsorption preferable. The theoretical models that the experimental data were compared to cannot provide a conclusive answer as to which local atop-site model is correct. The NIXSW model is ‘blind’ to the precise location of the neighbouring Au atoms. The favoured PhD model is the one that considers the S anchor to be bonded atop an Au adatom.
This work implies that the proposed co-occupation of sites model outlined by Mazzarello and co-workers is not likely. Jackson and co-workers suggest that there could potentially be some fractional occupation of bridging sites but that this would be ≤10%.
2.4 Gold adatoms
There has already been a brief mention of Au-adatom involvement in the adsorption of thiolate species to gold surfaces. Maksymovych et al.23 used STM imaging to provide evidence of Au-adatom involvement in the formation of SAMs. The study used short chain alkanethiols on the Au(111) surface. The proposed structure is an Au-adatom–dithiolate moiety. Fig. 4 shows how Au-adatoms could be a missing feature in the previous models of the stripe phase.24 An investigation into the location of the Au-adatom concluded that it is situated at a bridge site. The Au-adatoms are found to increase the stability of the SAM and are also likely to influence its electronic properties.23,25

A paper by Li et al.26 used STM images to investigate SAMs of long chain alkanethiols (octanethiol). The STM images supported evidence of Au-adatom integration into the SAM structure. From these images Li and co-workers set out to try and deduce a theoretical model that would identify the most stable SAM structure.
Numerous theoretical simulations were performed and the investigation found that there were three rather different structural models that could be attributed to the structure found by the STM images. This is because, although unique adsorption sites produce a well-defined structural lattice, the reverse is not necessarily true. Therefore, it is difficult to deduce a precise model from STM images. Further details of how the authors overcame this are given in the paper.
One of the models suggested was for Au-adatom–dithiolate molecules occupying bridge sites. There was little correlation between STM images and adsorption to bridge sites therefore this model was considered incompatible. The authors acknowledge that there is some adatom involvement but that the overall structure of the SAM is not inherently based on their contribution. The conclusion is that the octanethiol SAM consists of Au-adatom–monothiolate occupying fcc and hcp domains. In each case either domain is occupied. This study is a good example of the importance of understanding the underlying principles of adsorption in order to develop more comprehensive theoretical models for more advanced systems.
2.5 Mixed SAMs
In reality SAMs designed for practical applications are often more complex than those described so far in this review. In order to tailor the properties of a substrate surface, combinations of molecules are often used to produce a monolayer. These are commonly known as ‘mixed SAMs’. This review focuses on the electronic applications of SAMs although there are numerous other uses for such structures. Ferrocene is a common tail group used when applying SAMs to electronics as they are excellent organometallic electron reservoirs.27
Shaporenko et al.27 investigated a method of preparation when combining two aromatic molecules. Aromatic molecules were chosen over linear chains due to their conductive properties. Ordinarily mixed SAMs are formed by co-adsorption of the substrate in a mixture of both components. In this case two step adsorption is used. The substrate is immersed in a solution of one molecule, removed and then re-immersed in a solution of the second molecule.
The study showed that when selecting a molecule to form the inert matrix of a mixed SAM, it is a good idea to choose one with the same or similar carbonyl chain ‘tail’ as the active component. In doing so this allows for a more uniform distribution of the mixture. In addition the study found that the subsequent immersion technique formed a more uniform mixture of molecules compared to co-adsorption which is often found to form clusters. The composition of the SAM can be tailored by altering the immersion time.
Fujii et al.28 also looked at tailoring the composition and coverage of a mixed SAM. Fujii and co-workers investigated a mixture of an electroactive thiol and non-electroactive thiol. The SAM was formed by an exchange method.29 An alkanethiol SAM (formed from the non-electroactive molecules) was immersed in a solution of the electroactive molecules which then replaced some of the non-electroactive molecules within the SAM. The deposition of SAM on to the surface was altered by changing two parameters: (1) the mole fraction of each molecule (2) the immersion time in the solution.
The benefit of this method compared to normal methods is the ability to form isolated islands in addition to clustered molecules. The study concluded that the immersion time is key in adjusting the composition of the SAM and subsequently the electrochemical properties.
The formation of mixed SAMs is a practical approach, compared with the more theoretical studies discussed earlier. The anchor bond is known to influence the electrochemical properties of a molecule in a SAM. Understanding the influence of the head group, alkyl chain and tail group is essential in the development of usable materials.
2.6 Summary
A lot of controversy still remains in the field. Although some papers have been published supporting non-dissociative adsorption, the majority of monolayers studied appear to contain thiolate molecules. More investigations may be undertaken though the focus will most likely be looking at the physisorption and chemisorption stages, potentially with an extensive look at how this could affect the adsorption site.
At present the experimental data does not appear to directly coincide with the theoretical models. This highlights the importance of experimental investigations as theoretical models are only as accurate as the assumptions that they make. There have been advancements in this field over the past few years. Experimental evidence of atop adsorption and adatom involvement in SAMs has led to more comprehensive models. The theoretical modals will continue to develop, though it appears the field is slowly drifting away from the idea of single site adsorption and favouring more complex structures.
This review has not looked at longer chain alkanethiols in too much detail. These models will always be slightly less accurate compared to their shorter chain counterparts as there are more interactions to consider and therefore require more assumptions.
Overall, the field is still a long way from achieving a full understanding of the adsorption process. In spite of this the applications of SAMs are developing as new ways are found to functionalise the structure and improve desired properties.
3 Electronic applications of thiols
Conventional semiconductor transistors have continued to decrease in size since their origins in 1947. As the size of these transistors approaches the nanometre scale, quantum tunnelling effects become a significant problem. In order to continue the relentless decrease of component size in electronics, traditional semiconductor technology will need to be replaced. Molecular electronics, using molecules as electronic components, is seen as the ultimate goal in reduction of size.
The other and more immediate goal of molecular electronics is to complement and supplement current semiconductor technologies. Many molecules provide functionality that cannot be achieved with CMOS components. This will be particularly illustrated in Section 3.6 when talking about selective electrochemical sensing.
SAMs provide a high density of molecules for devices and can be formed on a variety of substrates of all sizes. The simple process for arranging molecules can also be used to create patterned SAMs. For this reason there has been a lot of research in to the use of SAMs in constructing electronic components.
This section of the report focuses on the electronic applications of thiols, primarily alkanethiols, on metallic flat surfaces, primarily gold. There are many other applications of SAMs; including for use as etch resists,30,31 crystallization surfaces32 and for use in corrosion protection.33–35 This section first details investigations in to electron transport through SAMs. It then presents work on modifying charge injection in organic thin film transistors. Investigations into SAMs as electronic junctions are described as well as their use in switching and rectifying systems. Finally, the use of SAMs in electrochemical sensing is detailed.
3.1 Electron transport through SAMs
In order to develop highly reproducible electronic devices the charge transport through monolayers must be understood. However, there are many different device platforms used (STM tips, break junctions, deposited electrodes, etc.) and there are many different molecules that are studied. In order to make comparable measurements a unifying framework is needed. For this goal the donor–bridge–acceptor system proposed by Ratner and Aviram36 can be used. In this system the electron passes from the donor, through the bridge, to the acceptor. In the case of SAMs the adsorbed molecule acts as the bridge and may also act as the donor.
Wang et al.37 studied the current–voltage characteristics of alkanethiols sandwiched between gold electrodes. By studying the temperature dependence of the current–voltage relationship they were able to discern between tunnelling and hopping mechanisms. As shown in Fig. 5 the I(V) characteristic shows no temperature dependence. This shows the absence of thermal activation and therefore the transport mechanism is shown to be tunnelling for alkanethiols with chain lengths below around 16 carbon atoms.

(b) Arrhenius plot generated from the I(V) data in (a), at voltages from 0.1 to 1.0 V with 0.1 V steps. These two plots show the independent nature of the I(V) data.37 Reprinted with permission from ref. 37, Copyright 2003 by the American Physical Society. 
The tunnelling mechanism may display either direct or Fowler–Nordheim tunnelling behaviour. These two mechanisms have distinct voltage dependencies. An investigation in to the voltage dependency showed that direct tunnelling was the mechanism for these shorter chain alkanethiols (octanethiol, dodecanethiol and hexadecanethiol).
The length dependence of this tunnelling mechanism was also investigated. The rate at which electron transfer takes place generally decreases with increasing separation of the donor and acceptor and is interpreted in terms of a first-order rate constant ket. The tunnelling current was shown to have an exponential dependence on molecular length. This is thought to be due to the separation between donor and acceptor sites but the changing density of different length alkanethiols may also play a role.
The electron transport through alkanethiols has been thoroughly investigated and is now reasonably well understood. However, the large number of other molecules used in SAMs research have varying reports of charge transport processes and further work on many molecules is still in progress.38
3.2 Modifying organic thin film transistors
As mentioned in the introduction, the electronics industry has begun looking for materials to supplement and eventually replace traditional semiconductors. For this purpose the organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) has been developed. OTFTs consist of a layer of semiconducting polymer (e.g. pentacene) positioned between three metal electrodes.
The charge injection between gold contacts and the polymer layer is governed by the hole barrier. The Mott–Schottky model predicts this barrier, the difference between the work function of the metal and ionization energy of the polymer (in this case pentacene), to be zero. This barrier has actually been shown to be 0.85 eV39 experimentally.
The work function of the electrode can be modified by introducing a SAM as a counterbalancing dipole. This reduces the hole barrier and therefore increases the charge injection between the polymer layer and electrodes. This is favourable as a greater charge injection leads to lower power consumption.
Marmont et al.40 showed that alkanethiols have a detrimental effect on charge injection between pentacene and Au electrodes but that fluorinated alkanethiols can improve the charge injection. This was shown to be due to dipolar origins rather than any morphological changes of the pentacene layer through AFM investigations. The AFM images of the pentacene films are shown in Fig. 6. Shortening the length of the fluorinated molecules increased the charge injection further.

3.3 Molecular junctions
Decreasing size, as expounded in the introduction, is the prevailing mission statement of the electronics industry. This continuous goal for shrinking the size of electronics has led to the idea of replacing traditional thin film transistors with ones based on molecular monolayers. SAMs provide possibly the easiest method of constructing molecular monolayers on metal electrodes.
Molecular junctions between two electrodes can be formed by self-assembly of alkanethiols on a bottom electrode followed by deposition of a metallic top electrode. Early studies found the vast majority of these junctions were shorted due to metal atoms penetrating the SAM and the formation of metal filaments between electrodes.41
De Boer et al.42 studied the effect of a thiol tail group on the formation of metal filaments by using dithiol molecules. The thiol tail group promoted the adsorption of the vast majority of metal atoms resulting in lower penetration of metals through the SAM. However, the thiol tail groups had little effect on the penetration of titanium atoms that destroy the alkyl backbone of the monolayer. This is important as titanium is often used as an adhesion layer in electronics.
The effect of adding an alcohol tail group on the formation of metal filaments was studied by Koo et al.43 This study compared the yield of junctions of octadecanethiol and 11-mercapto-1-undecanol on a Pt electrode with Ti/Au top electrode. Octadecanethiol provided a greater yield as the OH group present in the 1,1-mercapto-1-undecanol promotes the diffusion of Ti through the SAM.
To resolve the problem of metal filaments penetrating the monolayer, Akkerman et al.44 introduced a conducting polymer layer between the SAM and top gold electrode. The process involved adsorption of the SAM in to holes in a patterned photoresist and then spin-coating with PEDOT:PSS, a commonly used conducting polymer. Fig. 7 outlines the processing steps undertaken. Alkanedithiols were used instead of alkanethiols as the hydrophobic CH3 endgroup makes coating with hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS much harder. They produced 100 μm diameter junctions with >95% yield, a remarkable result.

Building on the structure developed by Akkerman using a conducting polymer coating Van Hal et al.45 were able to construct 20000 junctions on a single wafer with between 1 and 50 μm diameters with a yield close to unity. Furthermore, integration was demonstrated using strings of 200 junctions connected in series.
The resistance and mechanism of electron transport due to the Au–S bond and length of alkyl chain is well known, as described in Section 3.1. However, there is a need for further investigations in to the electronic coupling of SAM and conducting polymer and to assess any structural changes caused to the SAM by the polymer layer. Whilst the conducting polymer layer would seem counterproductive to the goal of shrinking OTFTs it does provide the robustness needed for studying molecular junctions.
3.4 Switching properties
The junctions produced by Koo et al. described in Section 3.343 were shown to display some switching properties. However, as a general rule, alkanethiols do not possess properties conducive to use as molecular switches. A molecular switch is a molecule that is able to switch between two or more stable states. The molecules primarily used as molecular switches for electronics are rotaxanes46 and catenanes.47 These consist of a cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene)(CBPQT4+) ring but with different recognition sites. However, this review focuses on alkanethiols, and hence the use of these molecules will not be covered in this review.
The way in which alkanethiols have been used in switching systems is to assist the conformation of phenylene ethynylene oligomers. These molecules display a conductance switching behaviour that can be used in molecular switching. Donhauser et al.48 showed that the switching properties of phenylene ethynylene oligomers placed at defect sites in an alkanethiol monolayer were dependent on the adsorption time. This implies that higher density SAMs provide a structural support for the switching molecules so that they do not change conformation as often.
This study provides an interesting application for alkanethiols in molecular electronics. The use of alkanethiols as a high density environment in which functional molecules can be adsorbed at defect sites is an area in which research may be directed in the future.
3.5 Rectifying properties
The first proposal of molecular electronics was the famous rectifier proposed by Aviram and Ratner in 1974.36 Whilst the idea of a molecular rectifier has been around for more than 35 years it is only in the past decade that it has been realised in actuality. A rectifier is a device that allows current to flow in only one direction, converting alternating current to direct current. This is quantified by the rectification ratio which is defined as the ratio of the positive resistance over negative at the same bias.
The first reports of rectification by SAMs between metal electrodes claimed rectification ratios as high as 5 × 105. Chang et al.49 investigated rectification of alkoxynaphthalene thiol on Pt with a Ti top electrode. Their findings showed a rectification ratio of 5 × 105 which they claimed was due solely to the molecular monolayer.
It can be argued that these rectification ratios are far too high to be due to the molecular monolayer present. The cause of rectification when using electrodes of Ti is likely to be oxidation of the electrode. For this reason Ti electrodes should be avoided when measuring rectifying properties of SAMs and studies with a top Ti electrode are unreliable.
Ashwell et al.50 conducted investigations in to how the asymmetry of the rectifying system affects the rectification ratio. Firstly, they investigated a rectifying molecule attached to a gold electrode by decanethiol in contact with an STM tip, providing asymmetry in electrodes. The STM tip was then replaced by a pentanethiol monolayer on a gold electrode, providing asymmetry in the position of the rectifying molecule. Finally, the pentanethiol monolayer was replaced with decanethiol, providing only asymmetry within the rectifying molecule itself. The rectification ratios of the setups described above were 18, 11 and 5 respectively; the I(V) relationships are shown in Fig. 8. The rectification ratios reported indicate that asymmetrical molecules may not provide rectification ratios high enough for use as rectifiers.

Nijhuis investigated ferrocene functionalised thiols as rectifying molecules.51 In this study the rectification ratio of alkanethiols were shown to be approximately 2. However, when adding a ferrocene tailgroup a rectification ratio on the order of 100 was observed. The reason for this greater rectification ratio is not fully understood but may be due to ionisation of the ferrocene group. In a further study52 arrays of these ferrocene terminated alkanethiols were constructed with a yield of 70–90%.
3.6 Electrochemical sensing
Electrochemical (EC) sensing is one of the areas of greatest research for the use of SAMs due to the ease of adding functional tailgroups to alkanethiol molecules. Traditional electrochemical sensors have used mercury electrodes. Due to the toxicity of mercury, replacement materials have been sought for use as electrodes in electrochemical sensing. Many materials have been used for new electrochemical sensing devices but SAMs provide a very promising alternative.
SAMs tailor the surface properties of a material, therefore controlling the electron transfer, which is the basis of EC sensing. SAMs modify the properties of a surface and by choosing the correct monolayer the interactions between surface and analyte can be maximised. SAMs provide a surface for electrochemical sensing that can be modified to be highly specific to types of ions or molecules. The functionality is easily modified using a process known as “click” chemistry in which tailgroups are added with relative ease.53
As in the applications outlined in the previous sections it is the stability of SAMs that provides the largest hurdle in electrochemical sensing. Monolayers must be stable over a wide potential window in order to be useful. Beulen et al.54 investigated the stability of thiols on gold using cyclic voltammetry and found they were stable over a potential window of −0.4 to 0.8 V. Later reports increased this window to −0.8 to 1.4 V dependent on the conditions under which the potential is varied.55
At more negative potentials reductive desorption occurs through the process:56R–S–Au + e− → R–S− + Au.
At more positive potentials oxidative desorption occurs. This process is more complicated and less well studied but may involve cleavage of the C–S bond and oxidation of sulphur. Despite these limitations there have been many studies that have successfully used thiols on gold to detect a wide range of analytes.
The desorption potential at both positive and negative potentials is dependent on factors such as chain length and headgroup repulsion. Whilst longer chain alkanethiols are more stable due to interactions between alkyl chains they have a lower conduction, as explained in Section 3.1. The selection of an optimal alkanethiol is therefore a balance between stability and conductivity. Lai et al.57 showed that undecanethiol provides a good compromise between stability and charge transport efficiency. It is also possible to use the dependence of thiol derivative desorption on potential to do selective substitution of SAMs.
The use of SAMs can be categorized in to two groups for use in electrochemical sensing. The first is to use one type of molecule as a layer that affects the electrical properties of the electrode. The second is to use a mixed layer in which either multiple functional groups are used as sensing components or where non-functional molecules act as a spacer between areas of functionalised thiols. Using only one type of molecule to form a monolayer for EC sensing has advantages in that it is relatively straightforward to achieve and these monolayers often display a high sensitivity. However, these systems can often only detect small analytes such as metal ions or small organic molecules. There are different methods of forming these single molecule monolayers. The most straightforward is to use simple alkanethiols or functionalised thiols that are readily available. If the specific thiol derivative is not available then one of two processes is necessary. It is possible to either functionalise alkanethiols and then adsorb these molecules on to the substrate or to first adsorb alkanethiols and then functionalise the SAM after adsorption to the surface.
Alkanethiols themselves have been used in EC sensors to detect organic molecules. Moressi et al.58 used a dodecanethiol modified gold electrode to detect the presence of altertoxin. Alkanethiols were also used in the detection of TNT, although functionalization with a hydroxyl end group improved detection.59
The most basic functionalization is the addition of another thiol tail group to form a dithiol and many groups have used dithiols to sense heavy metal ions. Malel et al.60 used a nonanedithiol modified gold electrode to sense Cd ions. Fig. 9 shows the resulting change in cyclic voltammetry measurements upon the addition of a nonanedithiol monolayer. Cd ions have been a focus of study for a number of investigations in to EC sensing with SAMs. Noyhouzer and Mandler61 investigated the sensing capabilities of a series of short-chain alkanethiol SAMs bearing different end groups, i.e. sulfonate, carboxylate and ammonium. In this investigation it was found that 3-mercaptopropionic acid provided the lowest level of detection for Cd ions and this echoed previous reports on the sensitivity of this monolayer towards heavy metal ions.62

Metal ions and small organic molecules have been detected using cysteine,63 lipoic acid,64 mercaptosuccinic acid65 and many more thiolated molecules. The preference of particular tailgroups to adsorbing analytes is one of the great advantages of thiols in sensing devices. For example, Aihara et al.66 used glutathione to detect lanthanide ions, as it has a preferential binding for these ions.
Monolayers of the same molecule in which there is a large spatial mismatch between head and tail group have also found a promising use in EC sensing. These disorganised monolayers have been used as a selectively permeable layer in order to allow the adsorption of specific molecules i.e. metal ions67 or organic molecules.68
Mixed SAMs in which the components are randomly intermixed have been used in order to immobilize certain molecules for sensing.69,70 However, in order to adsorb larger molecules for sensing, a mixed SAM is needed that includes some sort of spacer between functionalised sites. The difference between these two approaches to mixed SAMs is illustrated in Fig. 10. The spacer molecules used are most often alkanethiols or a simple derivative. The high density of these monolayers provides a membrane-like environment that is useful for immobilising biological molecules. This method is related to the use of alkanethiols to assist the conformation of switching molecules, as outlined in Section 3.4. Alkanethiols can be thought of as a conformational tool to assist in the positioning of functional molecules for any electronic application.
 Fig. 10  Schematics of the different use of multiple molecule SAMs showing (a) a randomly mixed monolayer and (b) a functional region of B molecules surrounded by spacer A. Note that the carbon backbone does not have to be the same length for molecules A and B. 
In this way the sensing of DNA has been achieved by using thiolated DNA probes which are then adsorbed in to alkanethiol monolayers.57 The high density of alkanethiol monolayers also provides a membrane-like environment that is useful for immobilising biological molecules. Radecka et al.71 embedded macrocyclic polyamine molecules with long alkyl chains within a 1-dodecanethiol SAM for the detection of adenine nucleotides.
All of the above studies have detailed functionalised thiols on gold electrodes as this system has been the focus of this section. However, thiolated molecules have been used with a variety of other metal (Ag, Hg, Pt and Pd) as well as semiconducting (Si and GaAs) electrodes. As the next section of the review details the use of SAMs with graphene it seems pertinent to briefly discuss the use of carbon based electrodes.
The most commonly used carbon electrode is the glassy carbon electrode (GCE),72–74 although there has also been use of carbon paste electrodes,75,76 doped diamond77 and screen-printed carbon.78,79 The material most similar to graphene is that of highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) and Section 4 will discuss electronic uses of HOPG is some detail. However, HOPG has not received as much attention as GCE in EC sensing due to the lower reactivity of basal plane carbon in comparison to edge carbon. The highly ordered surface of HOPG does mean that electron transport properties can be well understood and certainly the position of adsorption sites is better defined on ordered graphitic sheets than that of thiols on gold, the undefined nature of which was discussed in Section 2.
Unfortunately, the affinity of thiols to gold is not matched to carbonaceous materials. The most widely used monolayers with carbonaceous electrodes are aryl diazonium salts80–82 with some studies of amines76 and silanes.72 Thiols have been found to bond to carbon electrodes83 but are more often used to modify gold nanoparticles84 and mesoporous silica85 which are then placed on carbon electrodes. Whilst the carbon electrodes do not possess the same ease of bonding of thiols on gold, they do have certain advantages. They allow both chemisorption and physisorption to take place and have a wide window of electrochemical inertness. Combining the extraordinary electrical properties of graphene with either carbon or gold electrodes is a promising way in which to enhance sensing properties.
3.7 Summary of electronic applications
Over the past decade there have been many studies in to the use of SAMs, particularly alkanethiols, for electronic applications. This review indicates that future applications may focus on their use as molecular rectifiers or for the use of electrochemical sensing. Another feature will be the use of alkanethiols as a high density monolayer for use as a conformational aid for functional molecules.
The main stumbling block in the future use of SAM-based electronic components is the robustness of the molecular monolayer. Whilst traditional semiconductor electronics are deemed a failure if they do not work beyond millions of cycles; SAMs based electronics are deemed to be a success if they work on the order of 10 times. In this report we have described junctions that may be used over 100 times and after 75 days without failure.44 However, this is many orders of magnitude from the robustness needed for commercial applications.
Electrochemical sensing will continue to be the main focus of study in the use of alkanethiols and their functionalised derivatives. This is due to the lower need for robustness in EC sensing and the selectivity that functionalised thiols provide. There have been many reports of low level detection of many different analytes.
Molecular electronics has seen great developments in the last decade but it appears that few commercial applications besides electrochemical sensing will be realised in the near future. The robustness of SAM junctions is still far from the level needed and the switching and rectifying properties are not yet good enough. The one area in which SAMs will be used in the next 10 years is in electrochemical sensing as the specificity of functionalised thiols to particular analytes is a trait unmatched in other systems.
4 Graphene and SAMs
Graphene, a two dimensional honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms, was first isolated in 2004 and has since been a material of great interest due to its unique electrical and mechanical properties.4 As one might expect from a material that is all surface, modification with SAMs can drastically change its properties, and this is being taken advantage of in attempts to develop a wide range of applications. Section 4.1 discusses how graphene can be used to functionalize alkanethiol SAMs for use in electrochemical sensing experiments. Section 4.2 details the use of SAMs in the development of graphene based electronics, particularly field effect transistors, and Section 4.3 covers a variety of other ways in which graphene functionalized with SAMs are being used.
4.1 Electrochemical sensing
Section 3.6 reports on the recent work that has been done on using SAM modified gold electrodes in electrochemical sensing experiments. Graphene has been investigated as a material with which to attach to the alkyl tails of thiols to create electrodes with novel properties. Gold electrodes first modified by a SAM of n-octadecyl mercaptan (a thiol) and then a graphene nanosheet film formed via the controllable adsorption of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) have been fabricated86 and investigated, and were found to exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity towards the biomolecules ascorbic acid, dopamine and uric acid. In a later study, a similar electrode was fabricated by instead adsorbing pristine graphene sheets onto the SAM,87 and was found to exhibit a wide potential window and sufficiently high electrochemical and catalytic activity to be able to detect all 4 DNA bases separately and simultaneously. The cyclic voltammograms showing simultaneous detection of these 4 bases are shown in Fig. 11. This simultaneous detection has been rarely reported before,88 and implies that the Au electrode modified by the thiol SAM and the graphene nanosheet possesses electrochemical properties similar to a modified graphene electrode rather than a gold electrode.

4.2 Electronic applications/GFETs
One of the most heavily studied applications of graphene modified by SAMs is in the construction of graphene based field effect transistors (GFETs). GFETs have several theoretical advantages over conventional transistors; the high carrier mobility and current carrying capacity of graphene89 makes it suitable for use in very high frequency electronic devices,90 and its planar geometry makes it suitable for processing using more conventional techniques than alternative materials, such as carbon nanotubes. The planar geometry of graphene also means it is more resistant to scaling effects, which provides advantages when attempting to miniaturise devices in an effort to increase the device density on a chip and reduce power consumption.91 The use of graphene does present challenges; it is a zero band gap semiconductor, which typically results in large minimum channel conductivity resulting in a poor on/off ratio and higher device power consumption. A band gap can be opened by spatially confining the charge carriers by using graphene ‘nanoribbons’, but the required width scale of the ribbons to open a significant band gap is of the order of a few nanometres, which presents significant lithography challenges. Since the graphene layer is so thin, unless the graphene is suspended, the charge carriers are always adjacent to the interfaces between the graphene and the substrate or insulator. Hence minimizing scattering sources at these interfaces is important when attempting to create high performance GFETs.
There are two major approaches used when fabricating research GFETs. The first uses graphene obtained via mechanical exfoliation or grown via catalytic chemical vapour deposition on metal substrates and then deposited on to an insulating substrate which acts as the dielectric material in the transistor, normally Si capped by SiO2. Metal contacts are then affixed to the graphene sheet, acting as the source and drain electrodes, and a gate electrode at the back of the substrate/dielectric. Mechanically exfoliated graphene is often favoured due to the poor quality, and resulting inferior electrical properties, of chemically grown graphene sheets. A diagram of this arrangement is shown in Fig. 12a. The second involves functionalizing epitaxial graphene, which is grown via the degradation of the (0001) plane of SiC crystals.92 A gate dielectric layer is then deposited on top via atomic layer deposition. High-k dielectrics (here k refers to the dielectric constant), normally metal oxides such as Al2O3 and HfO2 are preferred as they can be thicker than lower-k dielectrics, and hence reduce leakage currents93 due to electron tunnelling. A gate electrode is then deposited on top of this dielectric layer. This set up is shown in Fig. 12b.

4.2.1 Deposited graphene/organosilane SAMs. 
When graphene is deposited directly on to a Si/SiO2 substrate, the charge carrier mobility is often severely impeded due to scattering sources at the interface. Unwanted doping of the graphene layer can also occur,94 and GFETs constructed using this method exhibit hysteretic field effect behaviour.95 The magnitude of these effects is strongly dependent on the details of the process via which the graphene was deposited and the precise morphology of the substrate, making them difficult to control.
Depositing the graphene sheets onto SAMs of organosilane molecules adsorbed onto the Si/SiO2 substrate during construction of GFETs has been shown96–98 to dramatically reduce the interfacial impurity scattering and hysteretic effects associated with the interface between the graphene and the substrate, therefore increasing the carrier mobility. The carrier mobility as a function of ambient temperature for two identical GFETs, with and without an octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTMS) SAM between the graphene and Si/SiO2 substrate, is shown in Fig. 13. The carrier mobility in the ‘bare’ Si/SiO2 GFET was observed to decrease at high temperatures, consistent with a dominant temperature dependent scattering effect. The OTMS modified GFET exhibited higher carrier mobility, and only slightly fluctuated across the temperature range. At room temperature the mobility of the OTMS GFET was 47000 cm2 V−1 s−1, over an order of magnitude higher than for the unmodified GFET. This effect is attributed to the closely packed, long and inert alkyl tails of the organosilane SAMs reducing scattering from charged impurities trapped on the substrate and remote interfacial phonon (RIP) scattering. Fig. 14 shows the response curves (conductivity as a function of gate voltage) for 4 GFETs, 3 functionalized with organosilane SAMs of varying alkyl chain lengths and one with no SAM. The Dirac point voltage, which is where the majority of the carrier population shifts from one type to another, corresponding to the conductivity minima, is shifted towards zero by the presence of the organosilane monolayers, with the SAMs with the longest alkyl chains having the largest effects. The slope of this plot corresponds to the mobilities of the charge carriers, with the hole mobility corresponding to the slope on the left hand portion and the electron mobility corresponding to the right. The SAMs have thus had the effect of increasing the mobilities of both types of charge carriers, again with the longest alkyl chain molecules having the largest effect.

The organosilane SAMs have also been used to control the electronic properties of the graphene layer as well as just reducing unwanted effects due to substrate interactions. A study looking at different organosilane SAMs with electric dipole moments of varying polarities and strengths concluded that using these SAMs was a promising way to exhibit control over the electronic properties.99 Analysis of fluoroalkyl trichlorosane (TFS) SAMs formed on the surface of HOPG showed that it induced a strong tuneable doping effect in the top graphene layer of the HOPG sample,100 with the ability to create hole densities up to 1.5 × 1013 cm−2.


4.2.2 Epitaxial graphene/perylenes. 
Perylene tetracarboxylic acid (PTCA) and perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) are planar aromatic hydrocarbons that form a brick-wall like monolayers on a variety of substrates, including graphite and graphene due to a π–π* stacking interaction.
Constructing a GFET based on epitaxial graphene requires the deposition of a thin layer of a high-k dielectric on the surface of the graphene sheet, with atomic layer deposition (ALD) the preferred method due to the precise control over layer thickness and uniformity that it offers. However ALD is a water based process, and the graphene surface is hydrophobic, and chemically inert. ALD of metal oxides onto pristine graphene has been shown to fail, with deposition only occurring at edge and defect sites on the graphene layer. It has been shown that chemisorption of O3 can create nucleation sites prior to ALD which increase surface coverage,101 although this has the effect of damaging the graphene lattice and reducing the mobility in the graphene sheet. In 2008 it was shown after a graphene layer was functionalized with a perylene tetracarboxylic acid (PTCA) SAM, a thin and uniform Al2O3 layer could be successfully deposited,102 without damaging the underlying graphene. This focussed attention on perylene SAMs as a promising route to developing graphene based electronic devices.
A low temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) study found that at 4.7 K, a SAM of perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA) formed on epitaxial graphene had a non-planar adsorption geometry and a brick wall structure.103 However, subsequent experimental studies at 77 K,104 and at room temperature105 showed that the PTCDA molecules lay flat to the graphene substrate, and adopted a ‘herringbone’ configuration, as is observed in PTCDA SAMs grown on bulk graphite.106 The PTCDA monolayers were continuous over large distances and over step edges in the underlying SiC substrate, and other surface defects. They follow a layer by layer growth mode, with sub-monolayer coverage yielding stable, isolated molecular islands. Weak n-type doping of the graphene layer due to the PTCDA SAMs is observed. X-ray reflectometry confirmed that the PTCDA layers adsorb to the graphene substrate with characteristic π–π* stacking bond lengths.107Ab initio calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) indicate that the electronic effects of a PTCDA SAM on graphene are highly dependent on the number of molecular layers. A transition between a surface-like phase and a bulk-like phase occurs between the bilayer and trilayer configurations. The PTCDA layers gain electrons from graphene, with the strongest effect in the bilayer configuration, where the charge transfer per PTCDA molecule is predicted as 0.42e. Trilayer films are predicted to exhibit the largest angle between the PTCDA molecules and the graphene sheet, at about fifteen degrees, and have the highest effect on the lateral charge transport characteristics. The PTCDA layers are also predicted to open a direct band gap in the graphene sheet; an isolated PTCDA molecule is predicted to open one of 136 meV, and this could be increased by increasing the coverage of the monolayer. The coverage can be controlled by changing the deposition conditions, allowing a level of control over the electronic characteristics.
The viability of electronic devices based on epitaxial graphene functionalized with PTCDA and ALD of high-k dielectrics has been demonstrated with the fabrication of metal-oxide-graphene capacitors108 which displayed high capacitance values and low leakage currents (∼700 nF cm−1 and ∼5 × 10−9 A cm−2 respectively at a gate bias of 1 V).

4.3 Other applications
Dye-sensitized solar cells, a class of thin film solar cell have received a lot of interest owing to their high efficiency and relative ease of production as compared to conventional silicon solar cells. However, most research has used counter electrodes coated with platinum via a sputtering process, and the high cost of platinum and the high cost and low throughput of the sputtering technique have made large-scale production of dye sensitized solar cells impractical. A variety of different materials have been trialled as the counter electrode, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, but a lower energy conversion efficiency was obtained due to their lower conductivity and catalytic activity when compared to the sputtered platinum electrode. However it has been recently demonstrated109 that electrodes formed by a layer by layer electrostatic self-assembly process from self-assembled monolayers of PDDA, graphene, and H2PtCl6 perform almost as well as the platinum electrodes, with a power conversion efficiency of 7.66% as opposed to 8.16%. However, these self-assembled monolayer based counter electrodes contain only a tiny fraction of the expensive platinum compared to the sputtered platinum electrode, and the construction process can be scaled up facilitating economic large scale production of dye sensitized solar cells.
A novel bottom-up approach for the fabrication of crystalline graphene structures has been demonstrated, based on the conversion of aromatic SAMs.110 Initially, a SAM was formed of 1,1′-biphenyl-4-thiols on a gold substrate. These molecules contain aromatic carbon rings of the same form as the hexagonal cells of graphene sheets. The SAM was then exposed to electron irradiation in a vacuum to cause the cross linking of these aromatic rings, forming a planar carbon nano-membrane. It was subsequently thermally annealed, initially in a vacuum, or later in Ar/H2 at atmospheric pressure.111 Nanocrystalline graphene was formed, comprising flakes of typical size 10–20 nm aligned with the substrate and covalently connected and it was found that the sizes of the graphene crystals (and hence the electrical properties of the bulk sheet) could be varied by controlling the annealing temperature.
Graphene/SAM films have also been investigated as a possible lubricant layer in NEMS/MEMS. It has been shown that rGO surfaces formed by the thermal reduction of graphene oxide (GO) sheets attached to a SAM of 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTES) exhibited suitable tribological properties for use as a lubricant coating.112 This approach was subsequently improved by instead forming a second SAM of octadecyltricholorosilane (OTS) on top of the GO sheets to create a trilayer film consisting of a GO layer sandwiched between two SAMs.113 Therefore, the complex thermal reduction step in an Ar atmosphere, was eliminated, and meant that the resulting film was hydrophobic rather than hydrophilic. The tribological behaviour was also found to be improved, with a significant reduction in friction and wear (and therefore a longer usable life). There is a continuing effort to develop lubricant films with properties such as these, as they are expected to find applications as biomaterials as well as other micro scale mechanical devices.
A GFET functionalized with a 1-octadecanethiol SAM has been found to exhibit significantly different current–voltage responses after being immersed in a dilute mercury solution,114 opening up the possibility of constructing heavy metal sensors based on graphene electronic devices.
Research has also focussed on the formation of SAMs of phthalocyanine compounds on graphene substrates,115,116 as hybrid materials based on combinations of graphene with metal phthalocyanines show preferential properties for use in photoelectrochemical cells.117
4.4 Summary
Research conducted over the last 2–3 years has shown that graphene functionalized with SAMs can provide a useful way of controlling its properties, and provide facile routes to developing many of the exotic applications which graphene is expected to enable. In particular, the techniques illustrated in Section 4.3 have the potential to be of great use in the development of nanoscale electronic devices, both by reducing interfacial effects between graphene and neighbouring materials and allowing fine control of electronic properties.
5 Conclusions
The mechanics of the adsorption process of thiols on gold is still not well understood. New experimental evidence has led to more comprehensive models, which are still being developed, although currently the experimental and theoretical results are some way off agreement. The balance of opinion is turning away from the previously held idea of single site adsorption and towards more complex structures.
Alkanethiol SAMs on metallic surfaces provide insight and a possible path towards molecular electronic devices, and can provide beneficial effects when integrated into conventional CMOS devices, although currently the robustness of the SAMs means that commercial applications based on these technologies are some time away. SAMs of functionalised thiols have proven successful in modifying electrodes for electrochemical sensing applications as they can be tailored for individual applications by selection of a tail group, meaning that almost any analyte can be detected. Robustness of the SAM layers in EC sensing is less of an issue than in electronic devices. Therefore EC sensors based on functionalized SAMs are likely to lead to real world applications more rapidly, especially in medical diagnostics.
SAMs also look to be a useful way of developing graphene based electronic devices such as GFETs, by reducing interfacial effects as well as allowing a level of control over the electronic properties of the graphene layer. Real world applications for devices such as these are currently limited by the difficulties in producing large crystalline graphene sheets, but SAMs have been shown to improve performance of experimental devices and may be important in the development of commercial applications as the graphene processing techniques are further developed.

 	Fig. 5  (a) Temperature-dependent I(V) characteristics of dodecanethiol (C12). I(V) data at temperature from 300 to 80 K with 20 K steps plotted on a logarithmic scale. (b) Arrhenius plot generated from the I(V) data in (a), at voltages from 0.1 to 1.0 V with 0.1 V steps. These two plots show the independent nature of the I(V) data.37 Reprinted with permission from ref. 37, Copyright 2003 by the American Physical Society.	 

 	Fig. 6  AFM images of 8 nm-thick pentacene films deposited on polycrystalline gold substrates for various surface treatments. (a) Bare gold (z-scale: 100 nm); (b) gold with DT SAM (z-scale: 35 nm); (c) gold with PFDT SAM (z-scale: 35 nm); (d) gold with PHDT SAM (z-scale: 40 nm). The morphology of the pentacene film does not depend on the nature of the SAM. Reprinted from Org. Electron.40 Copyright (2008), with permission from Elsevier.	 

 	Fig. 7  Processing steps of a large-area molecular junction. (a) Gold electrodes are vapour-deposited on a silicon wafer and a photoresist is spin-coated on top. (b) Holes are photolithographically defined in the photoresist. (c) An alkanedithiol SAM is sandwiched between a gold bottom electrode and the conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS top electrode. (d) The junction is completed by vapour-deposition of gold through a shadow mask, which acts as a self-aligned etching mask during reactive ion etching of the PEDOT:PSS.
