    , Accepted 4th October 2022First published on 5th October 2022AbstractTaking Cs2NaBiCl6, Cs2AgInCl6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 as examples of lead-free double perovskites (DPs), we study the photoluminescence (PL) properties of Mn-doped DPs. The electron localization function (ELF) reveals the more ionic nature of the Na–Cl bond in Cs2NaBiCl6 than that of the Ag–Cl bond in Cs2AgBiCl6. Bader charge calculations confirm the nominal +2 valence state of Mn ions in both DPs. Mn2+ ions introduce two defect levels in the band gap of the Cs2NaBiCl6 host, accounting for the d–d transition (4T1–6A1 transition) of Mn2+ and thus the subsequent orange PL. The changes of the crystal field and their influences on the emission energy of Mn2+ ions in different DPs are evaluated by calculating the Racah parameters (B and C) and the crystal field strength (Dq) obtained from energies of the terms of d5 in the Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+ and Cs2AgInCl6:Mn2+ systems. The results show that Dq in Cs2AgInCl6:Mn2+ is stronger than that in Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+. The analyses on bonding interactions of the Mn–Cl bond via ELF and the integrated projected pCOHP also confirm the stronger ionic bonding interactions and thus the boost of the crystal field strength in the Cs2AgInCl6:Mn2+ system, which results in the blue-shift of the Mn2+ introduced PL peak from Cs2AgInCl6 to Cs2NaBiCl6. Our results provide a new strategy to modulate the emission wavelengths, i.e., tuning the crystal field.
1 Introduction
Owing to the excellent photoelectric performance, the power conversion efficiency of lead halide perovskite solar cells increases rapidly from 3.8% to 25.7% since 2009.1–3 Halide perovskites have also shown diverse applications in solar cells, photodetectors, light-emitting diodes and lasers, etc. For example, researchers made extensive efforts to study the photoluminescence (PL) properties of metal halide perovskites to find more effective luminescence materials. The studies on all-inorganic halide perovskites, e.g., CsPbX3 (X = Cl−, Br−, I−), are the hotspot in recent years for their high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and color-tunable characteristic within the whole visible spectral range.4 Song et al. prepared blue, green and yellow quantum dot light-emitting devices using CsPbX3 (X = Cl−, Br−, I−) nanocrystals.5 Kovalenko et al. demonstrated that CsPbX3 exhibits strong emission and a narrow linewidth spectrum.6 Using the vapor-phase halide exchange method, Song et al. prepared CsPbBr3 nanowires and showed their excellent stability by continuously lasing for more than 8 hours.7
Lead-free halide double perovskites (DPs), i.e., A2B+B3+X6 (A = Cs+, MA+; B+ = Na+, Ag+, etc.; B3+ = Bi3+, In3+, etc.; X = Cl−, Br−, I−),8 possess photoelectric properties comparable to their lead-containing counterparts. Meanwhile, they are more stable and thus are more promising alternatives in recent years.9 However, most of them offer wide band gaps with parity-forbidden transition band structures.10,11 Doping is a robust strategy to break the parity-forbidden transition and induce additional dopant-related emissions.12 Xia et al. proved that the efficiency of orange-emission reaches 11.4% in Cs2AgInCl6 with 1% Bi doping.13 The PLQY of Ag+ doped Cs2NaBiCl6 NCs increases significantly from 1.7% to 20%.14 Liu et al. discovered that Cs2AgInCl6:0.1Cr3+ shows a near-infrared emission peak centered at 1010 nm with a PLQY of around 22.03%, owing to the spin-allowed 4T2–4A2 transitions of Cr3+.15 Han et al. found that Ag dopant can alter the dark self-trapped excitons (STEs) of Cs2NaInCl6 to bright STEs, resulting in a bright yellow emission with a maximum quantum efficiency of 31.1%.16 Manna et al. reported that Cs2Ag1−xNaxInCl6 NCs achieve a high PLQY when being doped with Bi3+.17 Woodward et al. determined that Cs2NaInCl6:Sb3+ displays high-efficiency blue-emission (PLQY = 79%) together with superior stability.18 Many previous reports also showed that other dopants can promote the PL properties of Cs2AgSbCl6, Cs2AgInCl6 and Cs2NaInCl6 DPs as well.19–22
Of the studied dopants, Mn ions bring about a great modulation effect to the luminescence properties of lead-free halide DPs. Manna et al. clarified that the PLQYs of undoped and Mn-doped Cs2AgInCl6 NCs are ∼1.6% and ∼16%, respectively.23 The strong orange-red photoluminescence of Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+ makes it a candidate for orange-red phosphors.24 After Mn doping, the photoluminescence of Cs2NaInxBi1−xCl6 changes from blue to bright orange-red, and the PLQY increases from 38% to 44.6% simultaneously.25 Tang et al. reported that the PL spectra of Cs2Na0.4Ag0.6In0.995Bi0.005Cl6:0.58%Mn2+ cover the whole visible region centering at 550 nm and 610 nm, making it a promising high-quality white phosphor.26
Although the Mn dopant can tailor the optical properties of the double perovskite effectively, some phenomena and the related mechanisms are not clear so far. When Mn dopants are introduced into different double perovskites, the newly generated orange emissions are usually attributed to the d–d transitions of Mn ions, i.e., the transitions between the 4T1 to 6A1 states. However, the emission peaks often change obviously in different host lattices. For instance, the Mn2+ ions introduce PL peaks around 620 nm and 600 nm in Cs2AgInCl6 and Cs2AgBiCl6, respectively.12,27 In some double perovskite alloys, e.g., Cs2NaBi1−xInxCl6 or Cs2Ag1−xNaxBiCl6 systems, the Mn-induced emission peaks will blue-shift or red-shift in the range of [577 nm, 610 nm] with variation of the cation constituents.10,28 Why do these PL peak positions make such differences? Few studies have concerned about this effect in DPs so far. We believe it originates from the change of the crystal field around the Mn dopant.
Moreover, a more fundamental question has yet to be investigated, i.e., how the Mn dopant distributes in those double perovskites. For example, there are also some high-throughput calculations to study the variation of electronic structures induced by various dopants to Cs2AgBiCl6 or Cs2AgInCl6, etc.,29,30 but the complexity of the dopant-induced defects is not considered. Our previous reports proposed that the Mn dopant will form the MnAgVAg defect complex, due to the charge balance.31 Zhang et al. found that two cations (Na+ and Bi3+/In3+) are easily replaced by a pair of Mn2+ ions in Cs2Na0.75Mn0.5Bi0.75−xInxCl6.28 Some reports cannot judge the exact position of the Mn dopant.10,24 However, if the dopant distributions in double perovskites are not clear, we could not determine the influence they bring about on the geometric structure and thus the PL properties accordingly. So in this work, we take Cs2NaBiCl6, Cs2AgInCl6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 as examples and carry out a series of theoretical simulations to determine the exact forms of the Mn dopant. Furthermore, we find that the crystal field strength Dq around the Mn ions in Cs2AgInCl6 is stronger than that in the Cs2NaBiCl6 lattice, giving rise to the blue-shift of the Mn-related PL peak from Cs2AgInCl6 to Cs2NaBiCl6.
2 Calculation methods
The density functional theory calculations in this study are accomplished using the Vienna Ab initio simulation package (VASP).32,33 To deal with the exchange–correlation between electrons, we adopt the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) method.34 The projector augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials have been employed to treat the electron–ion interactions.35 To overcome the underestimation of the band gap, we take the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) screened hybrid functional36–38 into consideration, in which the standard value of α = 0.25 is used to consider the HF exchange. The crystal structures are optimized for the cubic supercell containing 40 atoms. The cut-off energy, the self-consistent iteration loop convergence criterion and the force tolerance are set to 400 eV, 1 × 10−4 eV per atom and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. The Brillouin-zone integrations are performed using 4 × 4 × 4 Monkhorst–Pack grids. We use the LOBSTER code to analyze chemical-bonding interactions, in which the orbitals included are: (1) 2p and 3s for Na; (2) 3s and 3p for Cl; (3) 3p, 3d and 4s for Mn; (4) 5s, 5p and 6s for Cs; (5) 4p, 4d and 5s for Ag; (6) 4d, 5s and 5p for In and (7) 5d, 6s and 6p for Bi.39
3 Results and discussions
3.1 Geometric structures
The optimized structures of Cs2NaBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 are shown in Fig. 1. Both lattices belong to the cubic Fmm space group, and the lattice constants for Cs2NaBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 are 11.04 Å and 10.93 Å, respectively. The Na–Cl and Ag–Cl bond lengths are 2.79 Å and 2.74 Å, respectively. Note that the lattice parameters for Cs2NaBiCl6 are larger than those of Cs2AgBiCl6, which is consistent with the phenomenon observed by Bhattacharya.11 However, this surprises us, because the radius of Na+ (1.02 Å) is smaller than that of Ag+ (1.15 Å). So the lattice expansion from Ag to Na in both double perovskites may be attributed to the electronic environment or bonding interactions between atoms in those lattices. To better understand the bonding interactions of the Na–Cl bond and the Ag–Cl bond, we simulate the electron localization function (ELF) of the (0 1 0) crystal planes in both Cs2NaBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 systems. We find that the electron distribution around Na is more localized than that around Ag (see Fig. 2(a) and (b)), indicating the stronger ionic bonding interactions in the Na–Cl bond, which makes the length of the Na–Cl bond (2.79 Å) longer than that of the Ag–Cl bond (2.74 Å), accounting to the lattice expansion.

When the Mn dopants are introduced into the double perovskite lattice, their distribution and thus the defects they generate should be clearly understood. We build seven configurations of defects to examine the exact distributions of the Mn dopants in double perovskite Cs2NaBiCl6, including: (a) MnNa; (b) MnCs; (c) MnBi; (d) MnNaMnBi; (e) MnNaVNa; (f) MnNaVCs; and (g) MnBiVCl. Among these defects, the atoms on the left represent the dopants, the subscript atoms in the lower right represent the substituted matrix atoms, and the capital letter V in the complex defect represents the vacancies. For Mn-doped Cs2AgBiCl6, we also construct similar defect models, which are: (a) MnAg; (b) MnCs; (c) MnBi; (d) MnAgMnBi; (e) MnAgVAg; (f) MnAgVCs; and (g) MnBiVCl. We adopt the formula below to calculate the formation energies (Ef) of those defects: (1)where Edoped and Eundoped are the total energies of the defect-containing systems and the undoped systems, respectively. ni and nj are the numbers of elements removed and added in the process of defect formation, respectively. For example, ni = 1, nj = 1 for MnBi and ni = 2, nj = 1 for MnNaVNa. μi and μj are the chemical potentials of the elements. It can be seen from Table 1 that in both systems, i.e., Cs2NaBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiCl6, the lowest formation energies always appear for the defect MnBi, indicating that the substitution of a Bi atom by an Mn atom is the most favorite defect, no matter in Cs2NaBiCl6 or Cs2AgBiCl6 systems. This result agrees well with the previous reports of Zeng et al.10

Due to the differences in ionic radii and electronegativities between Mn and the host atoms (Na, Ag, Bi, Cs and Cl), all defects and defect complexes will change the local geometries in both lattices of Cs2NaBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiCl6. For instance, because of the smaller ionic radius of Mn, the lattice parameters decrease for all defects except MnCs in these two materials after Mn2+ doping. The geometric configurations of most defects in Cs2NaBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 are shown in Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI.† Besides the lattice parameters, the local structures around the defects also are altered by the Mn doping, which corresponds to the distribution of Mn defects. The MnCs defect in Cs2NaBiCl6 induces an obvious lattice distortion (Fig. S1a, ESI†). When MnNaVCs is introduced into the lattice of Cs2NaBiCl6, the bond length of Mn–Cl is 2.30 Å, and the bond angle significantly changed to 95.90° compared with the initial 90°. That is to say, the MnCl6 octahedron deviates from the ideal octahedron and undergoes obvious distortion (Fig. S1b, ESI†). Some defects, e.g., MnNaVNa, MnNaMnBi and MnNa, give rise to the contraction of the cation–chlorine bond, i.e., the Mn–Cl bond, while retaining the bond angles of 90°. That is, the ideal MnCl6 octahedron is preserved, which is shown in Fig. S1(c)–(f) (ESI†), respectively. For the Cs2NaBiCl6 system containing MnBiVCl defects, the bond length of Mn–Cl is 2.30 Å, which is the most obvious contraction among all the seven defects compared with the bond length of Bi–Cl (2.72 Å) in the undoped system (Fig. S1g, ESI†). The bond length of Mn–Cl for MnBi defects shrinks to 2.34 Å, and MnCl6 maintains a standard octahedral configuration (Fig. 3(a)). Meanwhile the lattice parameters a = b = c = 10.90 Å and the bond angles α = β = γ = 90°, so the cell remains a highly symmetric cubic crystal system. Similar to the case in Cs2NaBiCl6, when Cs2AgBiCl6 is doped with Mn to generate MnAgVCs or MnCs defects, the lattice distortions around them are large, which leads to the large formation energies (Fig. S2(a) and (b), ESI†). The defect of MnBi results in the formation of a cubic crystal system and a standard MnCl6 octahedral configuration in Cs2AgBiCl6 (Fig. 3(b)). As shown in Fig. 3, the Mn–Cl bonds in Cs2NaBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 shrink to the nearly same value, i.e., ∼2.34 Å. Meanwhile, the standard metal octahedra in both systems are preserved. That is, among all defects we considered, MnBi is the most favorable defect, which is proved by the lowest formation energies, no matter in Cs2NaBiCl6 or Cs2AgBiCl6.
 Fig. 3  The optimized geometric structures of (a) Cs2NaBiCl6 and (b) Cs2AgBiCl6 with MnBi defects. Numbers in all figures represent the bond lengths and bond angles, respectively. The red, purple, blue, light blue, orange and light green balls represent Mn, Cs, Na, Ag, Bi and Cl atoms, respectively. 
Moreover, Zeng et al. also confirmed by XRD that the Mn-doped Cs2Na1−xAgxBiCl6 samples are in cubic structures with the space group Fmm.10 Our simulation results show that most of the Mn-induced defects in Cs2NaBiCl6 or Cs2AgBiCl6 materials push the lattices to deviate from the standard cubic structure, which is illustrated by the complicated lattice variation presented in Fig. S1 and S2 in the ESI.† Nevertheless, MnBi defects could maintain the standard cubic lattice. These results prove that MnBi is the real defect in the Bi-based double perovskites, which is consistent with the aforementioned discussions about the geometric structures and the formation energies. Taking the MnBi defect as an example, we analyze the Bader charges around Mn dopants in the Cs2NaBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 systems. The Bader charges are +1.29 e and +1.22 e in Cs2NaBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 double perovskites, respectively. The non-integer electron transfer between the cation and the anions means that the bonding interactions between Mn ions and Cl ions are complex structures composited by ionic and covalent bonding interactions. However, we can still learn from the charge distribution that the Mn ions exist in both materials with the nominal +2 valence. Coincidentally, Majher et al. determined the valence state of Mn ions in Cs2NaBiCl6 with EPR measurements as +2,24 which agrees well with our conclusion. Finally, we find that the Mn–Cl bond lengths surrounding the MnBi defect in both systems are much smaller than that of the Bi–Cl bond in the pristine host. This arises from two facts, first, the radius of Mn2+ is smaller than that of Bi3+ and second, Mn provides fewer valence electrons to Cl than Bi does, so it produces local tensile stress around the defects and makes the Mn–Cl bonds contract further. Considering those aforementioned analyses, we use Cs2NaBiCl6 supercells containing MnBi defects as the representative configurations of Bi-based halide DPs to analyze their electronic structures and photoluminescence properties changed by the Mn dopant in the following sections.
3.2 Electronic structures

Fig. 4(a) shows that the band structure of Cs2NaBiCl6 is indirect. The calculated density of states (DOS) in Fig. 4(b) indicates that the conduction band minimum (CBM) of Cs2NaBiCl6 is mainly contributed by the Bi 6p orbitals, while the valence band maximum (VBM) is attributed to the interaction between the Bi 6s orbitals and the Cl 3p orbitals. The 3s orbitals of Na provide no contribution to the CBM or contribution to the VBM in Cs2NaBiCl6 systems. The appearance of Na ions in Cs2NaBiCl6 changes the electronic dimensionality, i.e., the NaCl6 octahedra do not work for the transport of the hole carriers, they act as blocks to separate the BiCl6 octahedra which are conductive parts.
 Fig. 4  (a) Band structure and (b) partial density of states (PDOS) of the double perovskite Cs2NaBiCl6 calculated using the HSE approach. The inset of (b) shows the DOS projected on Na and Cl around the Fermi level. The dashed lines represent the Fermi levels. 

Fig. 5(a) shows that the band gap of Cs2NaBiCl6 containing MnBi defects is 4.81 eV, which is larger than the band gap of undoped Cs2NaBiCl6 (4.66 eV). We can see that after Mn2+ doping, two impurity bands are introduced into the forbidden gap, one is close to the CBM and the other appears near the VBM, as shown in Fig. 5(a). Fig. 5(b) reveals that the CBM of the Mn-doped Cs2NaBiCl6 is mainly contributed by the Bi 6p orbitals and Mn 3d orbitals, while the VBM is attributed to the interaction between the Cl 3p orbitals and the Mn 3d orbitals. Fig. 5(c) shows the PDOS of the Mn 3d orbitals, which degenerated from the five-folded orbitals to the triple t2g and doublet states eg orbitals, owing to the crystal-field splitting. These findings are consistent with the study of Z. Milowska et al., which calculated maximally localized Wannier functions for the Mn impurity in a GaAs material.40 The degeneracy of the d orbitals is removed because three of the orbitals, the dxy, dyz, and dxz orbitals, are directed between the axes, but dx2−y2 and the dz2 are directed along the axes pointing at the ligands. Therefore, there is greater repulsion between the electrons in orbitals on the ligands and the dx2−y2 and dz2 orbitals than those for dxy, dyz, and dxz orbitals. Because of the electrostatic field generated by the ligands, the energies of all the d orbitals are increased, but the energetic shift of doublet states eg is higher than that of triple t2g. The scheme of crystal-field splitting is shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† As is well known, the physical properties of materials are determined by the electronic structures, for instance, the photoluminescence properties. If an electron is stimulated to a high energy state by external illumination and then it transits to a lower state subsequently, it is possible to produce ultraviolet-visible emissions. In Mn-doped double perovskites, the photoluminescence behaviors are predominantly contributed by the d–d transition of Mn ions. As illustrated in our calculated band structures in Fig. 5(a), the energy difference between the two impurity bands in Cs2NaBiCl6 is about 2.63 eV, which means that the d–d transition of the Mn2+ ion in the Cs2NaBiCl6 systems is about 2.63 eV. This result is consistent with the findings of Zeng et al.,10 where the Mn doping Cs2Na0.75Ag0.25BiCl6 system generates the d–d transition emission of Mn2+ with a value of 2.90 eV.
 Fig. 5  (a) Band structure, (b) PDOS of all atoms and (c) PDOS of Mn of the double perovskite Cs2NaBiCl6 system with MnBi defects calculated via the HSE approach. The red dashed lines represent the Fermi level. The orange and black double-headed arrows in (a) illustrate the Mn d–d transition and the band edge transition, respectively. 
We also chose the MnBi defect as an example to examine the influence induced by the dopant concentration on the electronic and geometric structures of Cs2NaBiCl6. We constructed two supercells, one is a 40-atom-supercell containing one MnBi defect, and another is an 80-atom-supercell containing one MnBi defect. Through theoretical calculations and analyses on these systems, we find that with a decrease in the concentration of Mn dopants, the dopant concentration affects the electronic properties of Cs2NaBiCl6 in a monotonic way, i.e., the band gap decreases from 3.87 eV in the 40-atom supercell to 3.81 eV in the 80-atom supercell. However, these changes in the band gap induced by the dopant concentration are small.
As noted above, the d–d transition of the Mn ion causes the orange PL emissions in the Mn-doped luminescent materials. However, there are some differences in the same Mn-induced PL emissions in different host materials. For example, Mn introduces an orange-red PL emission in Cs2NaBiCl6, while stimulating a bright orange PL emission in Cs2AgInCl6.23,24 Zhang et al. found that the PL peak originating from Mn2+ in Cs2NaBiCl6 is located at 577 nm,28 while Manna et al. found that in Cs2AgInCl6, the PL peak induced by Mn2+ lies at 620 nm.23 As is well known, the bonding interactions between the lattice ions and thus the ionic distributions can alter the host crystal field, including the d–d transition of Mn2+ ion doped materials. So it is a rational assumption that the crystal field strength around Mn2+ varies in those aforementioned double perovskites, leading to changes in their photoluminescence behaviors. Our previous research showed that among the defects introduced by Mn impurities into Cs2AgInCl6, the MnAgVAg defect had the lowest formation energy, that is, the MnAgVAg defect is the most easily formed defect type of Mn-related defects in Cs2AgInCl6, and we also confirmed the d–d transition induced by Mn2+.41
When an atom possesses more than one electron, there will be some electrostatic repulsion between those electrons. This repulsive interaction varies for different atoms, which depends on the number and spin of the electrons and the orbitals they occupy. The total repulsion contains two terms of parameters, i.e., B and C, which are known as the Racah parameters. Dq is derived from the quantum mechanic electrostatic model of crystalline fields and is determined by the radial electron density of the d-electrons, the charge of the metal ions and the distance between ligands and metal ions. To evaluate the changes of the crystal field in different double perovskites and their influences on the d–d transition energies of Mn2+, we calculate the Racah parameters (B and C) and the crystal field strengths (Dq) using the energies of the terms of d5 in the Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+ and Cs2AgInCl6:Mn2+ systems using the following equations:4 7B + 7C = E[6A1(6S) → 4T1(4P)](2) 17B + 5C = E[6A1(6S) → 4T2(4D)](3) (4) E2 = E[4T1(4G) → 6A1(6S)](5)In these equations, the units of B, C and Dq are all cm−1. Previous reports show that for Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+, the PLE peaks at ∼297 nm and 358 nm are ascribed to the 6A1(6S)–4T1(4P) and 6A1(6S)–4T2(4D) transitions of Mn2+, respectively. The orange-yellow PL peak at 577 nm is attributed to the 4T1(4G)–6A1(6S) transitions of Mn2+.28 By substituting these values into eqn (2) and (3), we obtain B = 324 cm−1 and C = 4486 cm−1. Using eqn (4) and (5) together with the values of B and C and the PL peak, we get Dq = 1195 cm−1 for the crystal field strength in the Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+ systems. However, in the Cs2AgInCl6:Mn2+ systems, the PLE peaks at 256 nm and 294 nm are generated by the 6A1(6S)–4T1(4P) and 6A1(6S)–4T2(4D) transitions of Mn2+, respectively. The transition of 4T1(4G)–6A1(6S) generates the PL emission at 620 nm.28 Taking these values into account, we obtain B = 509 cm−1, C = 5071 cm−1 and Dq = 1859 cm−1, respectively. All calculated results are shown in Table 2. The Dq of Cs2AgInCl6:Mn2+ is 1859 cm−1, which is greater than the Dq of 1195 cm−1 for the Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+ lattice.

A higher Dq means stronger Mn–Cl bonds, that is, the average strength of the Mn–Cl bonds in Cs2AgInCl6:Mn2+ is stronger than that of the Mn–Cl bonds in Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+. To understand this deeply, we explore their bonding interactions elaborately. Fig. 6(a) and (b) exhibit the calculated ELF of the (1 0 0) crystal planes of the Mn–Cl bonds in two DPs, which depicts the ionic nature of the Mn–Cl bonds, where the one in Cs2AgInCl6:Mn2+ is more ionic. Fig. 7(a) and (b) show the projected COHP (pCOHP) plots of the Mn–Cl bonds in Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+ and Cs2AgInCl6:Mn2+ DPs. In the framework of the COHP technique, bonding and antibonding interactions are drawing negative contributions to the right and positive ones to the left in the pCOHP plots. The Cl 3p and Mn 3d contribute to the bonding interactions of the two DPs, which meets our expectations. The average integrated pCOHPs (IpCOHPs) of Mn–Cl in Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+ and Cs2AgInCl6:Mn2+ are calculated respectively and are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The average IpCOHPs indicate the stronger ionic Mn–Cl bonds in Cs2AgInCl6:Mn2+. That is, our studies on COHP and IpCOHP confirm the aforementioned variation of the crystal fields from Cs2AgInCl6:Mn2+ to Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+.

The Mn2+ induced luminescence position is determined by the crystal field strength of the Mn-octahedron in materials. When the crystal field strength of the MnCl6 octahedron becomes stronger, the emission wavelength generated by Mn2+ is expected to red-shift, which can be interpreted by the Tanabe–Sugano diagram of the Mn2+ with 3d5 electronic configuration, as shown in Fig. 8. In this diagram, the 4T1 excited state of Mn2+ shifts downward to occupy the lower energy state with the enhancement of the crystal field, resulting in the red-shift of the Mn2+ luminescence. Our calculated crystal field strength of the MnCl6 octahedron in Cs2AgInCl6:Mn2+ is stronger than that of Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+, leading to the blue-shift of the emission peak from Cs2AgInCl6 to Cs2NaBiCl6. Meanwhile, investigations from Woodward et al. show that the PL spectrum at 632 nm in Cs2AgInCl6 shifts to 590 nm in Cs2NaBiCl6 materials, which confirms our conclusion.24

4. Conclusions
By series of theoretical investigations, we analyze the geometric, electronic and photoluminescence properties of Mn-doped Cs2NaBiCl6, Cs2AgInCl6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 materials. The ELF distributions in Cs2NaBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 confirm that the Na–Cl bonds show more ionic features than the Ag–Cl bonds. Through analyses of the formation energies, we find that among various Mn-related defects, the MnBi defect is the most favorite in both Cs2NaBiCl6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 materials, due to the least lattice distortion induced by the Mn dopants and the lowest formation energies. The Bader charge calculations confirm the experimentally observed +2 valence state of Mn ions after occupying the Bi site in those lattices. In the MnBi-containing Cs2NaBiCl6 systems, we find that Mn ions introduce two defect states into the forbidden gap. The transition between those defect states, i.e., the so-called d–d transition, accounts for the experimentally observed orange-yellow PL peaks in the Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+ systems. According to the crystal field theory, we calculate the Racah parameters (B and C) and the crystal field strengths (Dq) of Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+ and Cs2AgInCl6:Mn2+ to understand the differences between the PL peak generated by Mn ions in those double perovskites. We find that the crystal field strengths vary with the change in the local geometric structure around the Mn ions. The crystal field strength of Mn2+ in the Cs2AgInCl6:Mn2+ lattice is 1859 cm−1, which is stronger than the value of 1195 cm−1 in the Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+ lattice. The calculated ELF and the IpCOHP results confirm that the ionic bonding interactions of the Mn–Cl bond in the Cs2AgInCl6:Mn2+ system are stronger than the case in the Cs2NaBiCl6:Mn2+ system. The reduction of the strength of the crystal field around Mn2+ results in the blue-shift of the PL peaks from Cs2AgInCl6 to Cs2NaBiCl6. Therefore, we provide a thorough understanding and a new insight into the photophysics of the Mn-doped lead-free halide DPs. We also provide a new strategy to modulate the emission wavelengths generated by the Mn2+ dopant in optoelectronic materials, i.e., tuning the crystal field, which is critical to their applications in light-emitting devices.
