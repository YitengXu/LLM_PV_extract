    , Accepted 4th November 2011First published on 12th December 2011AbstractWurtzite–zinc blende (WZ–ZB) polytypic ZnxCd1−xSe layers were deposited on a ZnO nanowire array with full composition tuning by the chemical vapor transport method. As the composition tuned, three distinctive WZ–ZB polytypic structures appear. (1) At x = 0.2–0.3, the WZ and ZB domains exist separately in the inner and outer regions, respectively, forming a unique double shell structure. Their [0001]WZ and [111]ZB (or [100]ZB) directions are aligned along the WZ [0001] growth direction of the ZnO nanowire. (2) At x = 0.5, these WZ and ZB domains line up along the axial direction, producing a superlattice structure. (3) When x = 0.7–0.8, unique twinned superlattice structures, which are composed of ZB twinned segments having alternating orientations along the axial [111] direction, were identified. The outer region of the shell contains the higher Cd content than the inner region. In the fabricated photoelectrochemical cells, the double shell structure (x = 0.2–0.3) produced a highest photoconversion efficiency, indicating the most effective band alignments of the Cd-rich ZB and Zn-rich WZ domains. However, the twinned superlattice structure exhibits the lowest photoconversion efficiency, probably due to the larger number of interfacial defects between the twinned segments.
1. Introduction
The development of 1-dimensional nanosize architectures that can be used as a photovoltaic system is quite a challenging subject. In particular, ZnO nanowire (NW) arrays sheathed with a semiconductor nanocrystal shell are emerging as novel photoelectrodes for photoelectrochemical (PEC) or solar cells.1–13 The co-sensitization of different component nanocrystals is a promising strategy to improve the cell efficiency, by obtaining better band alignment in the electrolytes. For example, CdS–CdSe showed a higher photocurrent and solar cell efficiency than either of the single nanocrystals.6,11,12 Alloy nanocrystals have also been used as efficient sensitizers, owing to their advantage of a tunable band gap by adjusting their relative composition.9,13 Herein, we report another type of heterostructure approach to increase the photoconversion efficiency, involving unique wurtzite (WZ)–zinc blende (ZB) polytypic structure shells that have never been reported before.
We uniformly deposited ZnxCd1−xSe layers on a pre-grown ZnO NW array, with a tuned band gap (Eg) over the whole range (1.7 ≤ Eg ≤ 2.7 eV), using the chemical vapor transport (CVT) method. The measurement of the photocurrents of the ZnSe shelled ZnO NW arrays suggested that they constitute a promising candidate for photovoltaic devices.2,10 Recently, Xu et al. reported a synthesis of ZnO–ZnxCd1−xSe NW arrays with composition tuned shells using an ion-exchange method, and a maximum solar cell efficiency at x = 0.13 In the present study, we achieved a complete composition and structure control through a simple one-step CVT deposition process. The current work is a follow-up of our previous studies on ZnO– and TiO2–CdSSe NW arrays.9,14 For the first time, we observed that WZ–ZB polytypic structures of ZnCdSe alloy shells remarkably enhance the photoconversion efficiencies. A comprehensive electron microscopy analysis was employed to examine the crystal structures as a function of the composition. Therefore we were able to understand the composition dependence of the photoconversion efficiency, by correlating it with their WZ–ZB polytypic structures.
2. Experimental
For the synthesis of the ZnO NW array, Zn powder (99.99%, Aldrich) was used to generate Zn vapor, and a piece of ultrasonically cleaned indium–tin–oxide (ITO) glass was used as a substrate. The Zn powder was placed in a quartz boat, located inside a quartz tube reactor, and the substrate was placed on the top of this boat. An argon flow at 200 sccm was introduced into the reactor tube, followed by heating to 500 °C. The growth reaction was maintained for 60 min. To deposit the ZnCdSe shell layers, the ZnO NWs (grown on the substrates) were placed a few centimetres apart from ZnSe (99.995%, Aldrich) or CdSe (99.99%, Aldrich) or ZnSe/CdSe mixed powder, inside the reactor. As the source powder was evaporated at 800–850 °C for 10–60 min under argon flow, the ZnCdSe layers were deposited at about 500 °C. The thickness of the ZnCdSe shell was controlled by adjusting the growth temperature or time. The shell composition was controlled by changing the composition of the powder mixture.
The products were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4700), field-emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Jeol JEM 2100F and FEI TECNAI G2 200 kV), high-voltage TEM (HVEM, Jeol JEM ARM 1300S, 1.25 MV), and energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (EDX). High-resolution X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using the 8C2 and 3C2 beam lines of the Pohang Light Source (PLS) with monochromatic radiation. A UV-visible-NIR absorption spectrometer (Varian, Cary 1000) was used to measure the band gap.
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of the NW array electrodes were measured as follows. The NW arrays grown on the ITO substrate were sandwiched together with a platinized ITO counter electrode using a 40 μm spacer (Surlyn). The electrolyte (0.05 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in 3-methoxypropionitrile) was injected into the cell from the edges by capillarity. The PEC data were measured using a 1000 W Xe lamp (Oriel 91193) that was focused to give a power of 100 mW cm−2, equivalent to an AM 1.5G irradiation at the surface of the test cell. The incident light intensity was calibrated by an NREL standard crystalline silicon solar cell (PV Measurement Inc.). The data of current versus applied voltage were measured using a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. We also measured their PEC properties using a conventional three-electrode system comprising of an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a Pt foil counter electrode. Argon was bubbled through to remove the dissolved oxygen during the measurement. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured on an IPCE measurement system (PV measurement Inc.). The data was collected in the incident wavelength range of 300–800 nm at a potential of 0 V versusAg/AgCl. A 1 M Na2S electrolyte solution was used for both the PEC and IPCE measurements.
3. Results and discussion
We synthesized vertically aligned ZnO NW (length = 5 μm) array on an 1 cm2-area ITO substrate, then, deposited ZnxCd1−xSe shells on them using the CVT method (see Scheme 1). At x = 0 and 1, the single-crystalline WZ CdSe and ZB ZnSe shells are grown on the ZnO NW array. As the composition is tuned, three distinctive WZ–ZB polytypic structures appear: (1) a WZ–ZB double shell structure at x = 0.2–0.3, (2) a WZ–ZB superlattice structure at x = 0.5, and (3) a ZB twinned superlattice structure at x = 0.7–0.8.

The photographs of the ZnO, ZnO–CdSe, ZnO–Zn0.3Cd0.7Se, ZnO–Zn0.5Cd0.5Se, ZnO–Zn0.7Cd0.3Se, and ZnO–ZnSe samples show that there is a color change from dark to yellow as x increases (Fig. 1a). EDX and XRD were used to determine the mole fraction of Zn element (x) in each sample. Fig. 1b and inset show a typical SEM image of the ZnO–CdSe sample. The CdS nanocrystals deposited uniformly as a shell on the ZnO NW without any separately grown nanoparticle or nanowire impurities. Fig. 1c corresponds to its HRTEM images, revealing its core–shell structure, in which 30 nm-thick CdSe nanocrystals are coated along the entire length of the 80 nm-diameter ZnO NWs. The fast Fourier-Transform (FFT) image confirms the single-crystalline nature of WZ CdSe at a zone axis of [20]. The adjacent (002) planes are separated by a distance of about 3.5 Å, which is the same as that of bulk CdSe (JCPDS 77-2307; a = 4.299 Å, c = 7.010 Å), and are slightly tilted (5–10 degrees) from the axis of the ZnO NW. The scanning TEM (STEM) image, EDX elemental mapping, and line-scanning profile confirm the Zn and O elements in the core, and Cd and Se in the shell region, respectively (Fig. 1d).

Fig. 2a corresponds to a SEM image of the ZnO–ZnSe sample, showing the NW array with a length of 5 μm, grown on the ITO substrate. HRTEM images reveal few defects at the ZnO–ZnSe interface region, and the single-crystalline ZB ZnSe shell, whose [100] direction is aligned well with the ZnO [0001] growth direction. The d-spacings of the ZnSe (200) and ZnO (002) planes are about 2.8 and 2.6 Å, respectively, which are the same as those of the bulk (ZnSe JCPDS 80-0021, a = 5.618 Å; ZnO 36–1451, a = 3.24982 Å, c = 5.20661 Å). The STEM image, EDX elemental mapping, and line-scanned data confirm the O and Se elements in the core and shell region, respectively, and no trace of the Cd element (Fig. 2c and 2d). The Zn element distributes over the whole core and shell region.

Fig. 3a corresponds to the HRTEM and FFT images of ZnO–Zn0.3Cd0.7Se (x = 0.3), where the shell consisted of WZ and ZB domains separately in the inner and outer regions, respectively, forming a unique WZ–ZB polytypic double shell structure. As marked by (i) and (ii), the two ZB domains have the [100]ZB and [111]ZB directions (zone axis = [011]ZB) aligned with the ZnO [0001] growth direction. As marked by (iii), the [0001]WZ direction (zone axis = [20]WZ) of the single-crystalline WZ domain is aligned with the ZnO growth direction. A schematic diagram for the WZ–ZB double shell structure is shown in Fig. 3b. These polytypic structures prevail over the range of x = 0.2–0.3. The EDX elemental mapping (with STEM image) and line-scanning profile show the Cd and Se elements in the shell, and Zn and O elements in the core (Fig. 3c). It is important that the Zn element is dominant in the inner region of the shell, but is present significantly less so in the outer region. The Cd element is distributed in the opposite way. We'll discuss this inhomogeneous composition distribution in the following XRD and UV-visible spectra data analyses.
 Fig. 3  (a) HRTEM and FFT images (zone axis of the shell = [011]ZB and [20]WZ) of ZnO–Zn0.3Cd0.7Se. The shell consisted of ZB (outer) and WZ (inner) domains, whose (i) [100]ZB, (ii) [111]ZB, and (iii) [0001]WZ directions are aligned along the ZnO [0001] direction. (b) A schematic diagram for the WZ–ZB double shell structure. (c) STEM image, EDX elemental mapping, and line-scan profile of Zn, O, Cd, and Se. 
In the ZnO–Zn0.5Cd0.5Se (x = 0.5), the shell consisted of separated ZB and WZ domains, with a higher fraction of the ZB phase. Although the domains are not uniform in size, they line up along the wire axis, forming a WZ–ZB superlattice structure (Fig. 4a). The FFT images show that the (i) [100]ZB (zone axis = [011]ZB) and (ii) [0001]WZ (zone axis = [20]WZ) directions of the domains are aligned with the ZnO [0001] growth direction. A schematic diagram for this WZ–ZB superlattice structure shell is shown in Fig. 4b. Another Zn0.5Cd0.5Se shell is composed of the WZ and ZB domains whose respective (i) [111]ZB and (ii) [0001]WZ directions are parallel to the ZnO growth direction (Fig. 4c). The STEM image and EDX line-scanning profile shows that the Cd concentration is higher in the outer region of the shell, which is similar in the case of ZnO–Zn0.3Cd0.7Se (Fig. 4d).

At x = 0.7–0.8, a unique twinned superlattice structure appears. HRTEM reveals that the Zn0.7Cd0.3Se shell consisted of ZB twinned segments with a period of 2–10 nm (Fig. 5a). A schematic diagram for the ZB twinned superlattice structure shell is shown in Fig. 5b. The octahedral slice segments have six apices directed to the six equivalent 〈112〉 directions: [11], [2], [2], [11], [11], [2], at the [111] zone axis (top views). The segments stack with alternating orientations along the [111] direction, forming the twinned superlattice structure. At the [011] zone axes, the two apices stick out, resulting in the appearance of a zigzagged morphology (side view). At the [12] zone axes, the apices become collinear, so that a straight morphology appears (side view).

At the 〈112〉 and 〈011〉 zone axes, the shell showed straight and zigzagged morphologies, respectively. (c) The two zigzagged segments (i) and (ii) share the [111] and [] spots. (d) The 30° turn morphology and their corresponding FFT images (inset) show the single-crystalline nature at the zone axis of [12]. (e) A STEM image, EDX elemental mapping and a line-scan profile of Zn, O, Cd, and Se. 
The lattice-resolved TEM images of the morphologies observed before and after tilting at 30° are shown in Fig. 5c and 5d, respectively, and their corresponding FFT images are shown in the corresponding insets. The zigzagged segments share the [111] and [] spots at the zone axis of [011], that is, have (111) twin planes (insets). We turned the TEM grid holder in order to tilt it around the axial direction. The images taken at a tilt angle of 30° show the single-crystalline feature without any twin planes. The zone axis becomes [12], where the twinned spots cannot be seen. After tilting the NW by a further 30°, the straight surface turns into a zigzagged one. The EDX elemental mapping (with STEM image) and line-scanning profile show the Cd and Zn elements in the shell (Fig. 5e).

Fig. 6 shows the XRD pattern (2θ = 23–35 degrees) for the magnified scaled ZnCdSe peaks. The XRD pattern of CdSe shows WZ (100), (002), and (101) peaks, and that of ZnSe shows ZB (111) peaks. As x increases, the peaks of the ZnCdSe alloy shift continuously from that of CdSe to that of ZnSe. The WZ (100) and (101) peaks appear at x ≤ 0.5, while only the ZB (111) peak appears at x ≥ 0.7, showing a phase change from WZ to ZB as x increases. The ZB phase in the range of x ≤ 0.5 cannot be identified due to a peak overlap with those of the WZ phase. The occurrence of this phase change at x = 0.5–0.7 is consistent with that of ZnCdSe NWs and films.15–17

The ZnO (100) and (002) peaks are indexed. The asymmetric WZ (002) (or ZB (111)) peak was resolved into two or three bands (P1–P3) by means of a Voigt function. 
The broad and asymmetric peak profile of the alloy supports the inhomogeneous distribution of Cd and Zn elements along the cross section. The asymmetric WZ (002) or ZB (111) peak of the alloy shell was able to be resolved into two or three bands (P1–P3), as shown by the dotted lines. For example, the WZ (002) peak at x = 0.3 was resolved into three bands by means of a Voigt function. The composition of three components (xi) was calculated using Vegard's rule and then the average composition was estimated using the mean equation: x = Σxifi, where fi is the fraction of the resolved bands. It has x1 = 0.1, f2 = 0.3; x2 = 0.3, f2 = 0.55; x3 = 0.6 and f2 = 0.15, so the average composition (x = 0.3) is the same as that determined from the position of the unresolved peak. The composition, the fraction of the resolved bands, and the average composition are listed in the ESI, Table S1.† This analysis indicates that the Cd-rich and Zn-rich composition layers explicitly coexist.
All ZnxCd1−xSe nanocrystals are grown on the surface of the ZnO NWs at the same temperature (500 °C), following the vapor–solid (VS) mechanism. The thermodynamically stable WZ CdSe (x = 0) grow by matching the polarity of the WZ CdSe and ZnO (001) planes, despite their large lattice constant mismatch. In the case of ZnSe (x = 1), the smaller lattice constant mismatch between the ZB ZnSe (200) and ZnO (002) planes, 2.8 versus 2.6 Å, would drive the growth of the thermodynamically stable ZB phase. In the cubic unit cell system, there is a general sequence in the surface energy of the crystallographic planes: {111} < {100} < {110}.18 The growth of the ZB (100) planes would be also forced by their high surface energy.
Polytypic structures were observed for CdSe and ZnSe nanobelts synthesized by the Au-catalyzed vapor–liquid–solid (at 750 °C) and VS (at 950 °C) mechanisms, respectively.19,20 They both showed the WZ–ZB junctions through the [0001]WZ and [111]ZB directions. The present polytypic nanocrystals are distinctively grown as shells on the ZnO NW at a lower temperature (500 °C), following the VS mechanism. There are no polytypic structures observed in pure CdSe and ZnSe shell. Therefore, we suggest that the formation of the polytypic structures would originate from the atomic disorder of the ZnCdSe alloy. The polytypic growth of the ZnCdSe alloy produces two types of junctions, [0001]WZ–[100]ZB and [0001]WZ–[111]ZB, along the [001] growth direction of ZnO NW. The preferred junction type would entail the evolution of the polytypic structures accompanying the composition tuning.
In the x = 0.2–0.3 shell, the WZ and ZB domains form in the inner and outer shell region, respectively. The inner WZ domains produce favorably due to the polarity matching. The incorporation of Zn atoms into CdSe lattice would produce disorder at the atomic level. Owing to the subtle energy difference between WZ and ZB (i.e., 5.3 meV/atom for ZnSe and 1.4 meV/atom for CdSe) and their atomically identical (001)WZ and (111)ZB planes, the atomic disorder would allow the growth of the ZB (111) planes by forming a radial junction of [0001]WZ–[111]ZB with the active (001)WZ planes of the WZ inner domains.21 The growth of the higher surface energy ZB (100) planes produces a radial junction of [0001]WZ–[100]ZB. This WZ–ZB double shell structure would be more effective to induce the band alignment as described below.
As the content of Zn increases, the ZB domains become dominant and the WZ domains vanish. In the x = 0.5 shell, the WZ inner shell structures are destroyed, whereas the ZB domains are grown with the (111) and (100) planes directly attached to the ZnO (001) planes. The (001) planes of the WZ domain still grow by matching the polarity of the WZ (001) planes of ZnO, and produces the [0001]WZ–[111]ZB or –[100]ZB junction with the ZB domains. These WZ–ZB junctions along the axial direction constituted the superlattice structure.
At x = 0.7–0.8, twinned superlattice structures emerge as a result of the uniform junction of the [0001]WZ and [111]ZB. This structure is essentially the same as that of the group III–V semiconductor (e.g., InAs, InP, and GaP) NWs, in which a twin plane in a ZB NW (grown in the [111] direction) consists of a monolayer of the WZ phase.22,23 The atomic disorder of the alloy allows the shorter periodic insertion of the metastable WZ layer through the active [0001]WZ–[111]ZB junction. The conduction band of both WZ CdSe and ZnSe is located at a higher energy than that of ZB ones, and the band offset at the (111) interfaces increases with increasing ionicity: 0.120 eV for CdSe and 0.074 eV for ZnSe.24 This suggests that the [0001]WZ–[111]ZB junction is energetically more favorable for the lower offset ZnSe. That explains why the twinned superlattice structures formed in the ZnSe-like composition range (x = 0.7–0.8), but not in the CdSe-like one (x < 0.5). Nevertheless, further theoretical studies are required to provide the mechanism underlying this change of polytypic structure upon composition tuning.
Our group previously observed the formation of Zn-rich ZnCdS alloy layers in the interface region of ZnO–CdS core–shell NWs, due to the melting of the ZnO NW surface during the shell deposition.9 Furthermore, the TiO2–CdSxSe1−x NWs showed separate CdS and CdSe layers in the inner and outer regions, respectively, and the CdSSe alloy at the intermediate region.14 It was suggested that the lower mobility of the heavier element (Se) than the lighter one (S) results in the Se-rich outer region. The present multi-composition structure consists of a Zn-rich (or ZnSe-like) inner region and a Cd-rich (or CdSe-like) outer region which is quite consistent with those previous results, and rationalized by the same explanation. The higher Zn content of the inner WZ domains results in a better lattice constant matching with the ZnO (cf., c = 7.010 Å for CdSe, 6.506 Å for ZnSe, 5.20661 Å for ZnO).

Fig. 7a shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of the samples. The onset of the absorption band occurs at 1.7 eV (747 nm) and 2.6 eV (470 nm) for CdSe and ZnSe, which is close to the band gap of the bulk, viz. Eg (WZ CdSe) = 1.73 eV and Eg (ZB ZnSe) = 2.67 eV, respectively. The onset position was found to be 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.1, and 2.4 eV, respectively, for x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.8. The absorption onsets are significantly red shifted from those of the bulk counterpart. This red shift is ascribed to the Cd-rich outer region, as we discussed using the EDX and XRD data. Furthermore, the ZB phase induces photon absorption in the longer wavelength region than the WZ phase, i.e., 1.73 eV (WZ) and 1.67 eV (ZB) for CdSe; 2.73 eV (WZ) and 2.67 eV (ZB) for ZnSe.25,26 The 25 nm red shift is expected for the ZB CdSe. The red shift would be more significant for the Cd-rich composition range (0 < x ≤ 0.5), where the WZ and ZB phase domains coexist. Fig. 7b corresponds to the plot of Eg (estimated from the onset energies) as a function of x, showing a significant deviation from linearity. The nonlinearity can be expressed by Eg(x) = Eg(CdSe) + (Eg(ZnSe) − Eg(CdSe) − b)x + bx2, where b is the bowing parameter. The least square fit yields b = 0.79 eV, which is larger than those of the NWs and bulk (0.41–0.48).15,16,27 This large non-linearity must be related to their Cd-rich ZB outer region.

We performed incident photon-to-current-conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements to study their photoresponse as a function of the wavelength of the incident light (Fig. 8c). The IPCE shows a significant red-shift onset, which is strongly linked with that of the UV-visible absorption band. The plot of JSC and the solar cell efficiency (“A”) as a function of x shows the composition dependence (Fig. 8d). The x = 0.2–0.3 sample exhibits the highest photocurrent and solar cell efficiency (η = 1.5%), being higher than the CdSe or ZnSe ones. In contrast, the x = 0.8 sample shows the lowest values. The two sets of PEC cell data show consistently that the x = 0.2–0.3 samples generate the highest photoconversion efficiency.
Recently, a higher photocurrent of co-sensitized TiO2 (or ZnO)–CdS–CdSe film or array, as compared to those of the single component (–CdS and –CdSe) or –CdSe–CdS, was suggested to be a result of the band alignment (“Fermi level alignment”) of the CdS and CdSe in the electrolytes.11,12,28,29TiO2 (or ZnO), CdS, and CdSe are connected together, and the insertion of CdS between TiO2 and CdSe provides a large driving force for the injection of photoexcited electrons to the TiO2 by elevating the conduction band edge of CdSe and creating electric fields at the TiO2–CdS–CdSe interfaces. Herein, we suggest a band alignment model as illustrated in Fig. 9. The XRD analysis suggests three composition (x = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.6) layers for Zn0.3Cd0.7Se. We simply suppose that the WZ inner shell contains x = 0.6, and the ZB outer shell contains x = 0.1 and 0.3. If the band position of the Cd-rich ZB outer shell shifts upward, a “type II” band alignment occurs.30 The Cd-rich ZB outer shell produces the photoelectrons upon visible light absorption, and then the photoelectrons will be transferred to the lower energy conduction band (CB) of the Zn-richer WZ inner shell. A possible transition from the valence bond (VB) of the Cd-rich outer shell to the CB of the Zn-rich inner shell decreases the band gap to amplify the photon absorption at the longer wavelength (as marked by dotted arrows). The WZ inner shell can increase the lattice constant matching with the ZnO core, and thus reduce the interfacial defects. This rationalizes the result that the absence of the WZ inner shell (at x = 0.5) decreases the photoconversion efficiency. Therefore the WZ inner shell can provide a driving force for the injection of photoexcited electrons from the ZB outer shell to the ZnO NW core by creating an optimized band alignment. We conclude that this WZ–ZB polytypic double shell structure induces a synergy effect which increases the photon absorption and photocurrents. On the other hand, the larger number of interfacial defects between the twinned segments (x = 0.7–0.8) could play the role of trapping sites for the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, resulting in the lowering of solar cell performance.

Cutter and Woods proposed that the polytypic structure of ZnSe induces the anomalous polarization dependence of the photocurrents.26 Recently, Wu et al. reported the WZ interlayer between the ZnO NW and ZB ZnSe shell, which extends the photoresponse to a threshold below the band gap.10 The PEC studies on the ZnxCd1−xSe films showed a maximum photocurrent output at x = 0.1–0.2, which is consistent with the present result.31,32 The polytypic structure may be responsible for this unusual composition dependence. Recent work on the electrical properties of InAs NWs consistently reported that the twinned superlattices increase the resistivity by up to 2 orders of magnitude compared to the single phase.33 As a concluding remark, the control of the polytypism enables the solar cell performance to be enhanced.
4. Conclusion
In summary, ZnO–ZnxCd1−xSe core–shell NW arrays were synthesized on ITO substrates with complete composition tuning by the CVT method. The shell layers have an average thickness of 30 nm. At x = 0 and 1, the single-crystalline WZ CdSe and ZB ZnSe shells are grown on the ZnO NW array. As the composition is tuned, three distinctive WZ–ZB polytypic structures appear: (1) a WZ–ZB double shell structure at x = 0.2–0.3, (2) a WZ–ZB superlattice structure at x = 0.5, and (3) a ZB twinned superlattice structure at x = 0.7–0.8. The outer region contains the higher Cd content than the inner region. In the Zn0.3Cd0.7Se, the WZ and ZB domains exist separately as the inner and outer shells, respectively, forming a double shell structures. Their [0001]WZ and [111]ZB (or [100]ZB) directions are aligned along the [0001] growth direction of the WZ ZnO NW core. As x increases to 0.5, the ZB domain becomes the dominant one, and the ZB–WZ superlattice structure is produced. The Zn0.7Cd0.3Se consisted of short-period (2–10 nm) twinned superlattice structures, in which the ZB twinned segments have alternative orientations along the axial [111] direction. We tentatively explain that the atomic disorder of the alloy induces the evolution of these polytypic structures.
We fabricated PEC cells using these NW arrays and measured their photocurrents under AM 1.5G irradiation. The x = 0.2–0.3 shell results in the highest photocurrent and photoconversion efficiency. This indicates that the novel band alignment of the WZ–ZB double shell structures increases the cell performance, by producing an efficient electron–hole separation following a band alignment. In contrast, the interfacial defects of the twinned segments significantly reduced the cell efficiency.
