    , Accepted 3rd March 2018First published on 5th March 2018AbstractSolution processed bulk heterojunction organic photodetectors (OPDs) based on a conjugated dimeric porphyrin small molecule as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor show a broad and strong spectral response from 300 to 1000 nm. At room temperature and zero bias, the panchromatic OPDs are responsive to the near infrared (NIR) region, exhibiting a very low dark current density of 4.25 × 10−10 A cm−2 with a very high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 48% at 850 nm, leading to a responsivity of 0.33 A W−1 at 850 nm and detectivity of over 1013 Jones from 360 to 950 nm, with a peak detectivity value of 5.73 × 1013 Jones at 850 nm. All these parameters are among the best for small molecule NIR OPDs to date, and are comparable to the best NIR OPDs based on polymers, demonstrating the potential of small molecules in panchromatic photodetectors.
Introduction
In the past few years, photodetector studies have focused mainly on adjusting the spectral response bandwidth to achieve narrowband1 or broadband response photodetectors.2,3 In particular, panchromatic photodetectors that are highly responsive to the near infrared (NIR) region have tremendous potential in scientific and industrial applications, such as in remote controls, night vision, chemical/biological sensing, optical communication, and spectroscopic and medical instruments. Because they inherently possess substantial advantages over their inorganic counterparts, such as adequate flexibility, low cost fabrication, large-area detection, tunable response spectra, being lightweight, and having high performance at room temperature, organic photodetectors (OPDs) that are highly responsive to the NIR region have attracted considerable attention recently,4–14 and a detectivity (D*) of up to 1013 Jones (1 Jones = 1 cm H1/2 W−1) was achieved for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) NIR OPDs based on a conducting polymer,15 implying the huge potential of OPDs. Small molecules (SMs) do not suffer from a poly-dispersity index, regio-irregularity, and the batch-to-batch variation of polymers,16–18 making them promising in OPDs.19–22 However, only a very limited number of NIR OPDs have been reported based not only on polymers, but also on SMs, with the best detectivity in the order of 1012 Jones for SMs to date.19,21,23–25
Materials that are highly responsive in the NIR region are very important to panchromatic OPDs. In order to obtain these materials, firstly, suitable material systems should be selected because most organic photoelectric materials do not exhibit light absorption in the NIR region and some materials do not exhibit a desirable photoelectronic response even if they have light absorption in the NIR region. Phthalocyanines are a type of promising NIR OPD material, and Su et al. reported NIR OPDs based on a phthalocyanine (PbPc)/C60 planar heterojunction structure with a detectivity of 2.34 × 1011 Jones at zero bias.23 The group further improved the D* up to 2.7 × 1012 Jones at 890 nm by replacing the planar heterojunction structure with a planar mixed molecular heterojunction one.19 However, the difficulties in further functionalizing phthalocyanine limit its application in OPDs. Secondly, suitably functionalizing a material is also one of the keys to achieve a high performance NIR OPD material. For example, non-functionalized porphyrins, such as tetraphenyl porphyrin, show no light absorption in the NIR region, although they do have a similar macro-ring to phthalocyanine. In contrast, after we introduced ethynyl linkages and electron acceptor units into a porphyrin core in order to synthesize conjugated electron donor–acceptor (D–A) porphyrin SMs, we achieved the best performing SM NIR OPDs with high D* values of more than 1012 Jones from 380 to 940 nm and a detectivity of 5.16 × 1012 Jones at 890 nm at zero bias,21 demonstrating that porphyrins are very promising in OPDs.
Given that the porphyrin SM that we reported previously shows excellent OPD and photovoltaic performance,21 and that porphyrin dimers usually show higher molar coefficients and longer wavelength absorption coverage than porphyrin monomers,26 we designed and synthesized a donor–acceptor porphyrin dimeric SM CS-DP (Fig. 1), which shows strong and broad absorption in the NIR region up to 1100 nm, and the BHJ solar cells based on CS-DP show a high power conversion efficiency of up to 8.29%.27 Herein, we report solution-processed BHJ NIR OPDs based on CS-DP as the donor and PC71BM ((6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester) as the acceptor. The optimized OPDs show a very low dark current density of 4.25 × 10−10 A cm−2 and a detectivity of over 1013 Jones between 360 and 950 nm.

Experimental
Device fabrication

CS-DP was synthesized according to the procedure reported previously27 and PC71BM was purchased from 1-Material and used without further purification. Solution-processed BHJ OPDs were fabricated as follows: indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates were cleaned prior to device fabrication by sonication in acetone, detergent, distilled water, and then isopropyl alcohol. After treatment with oxygen plasma for 4 min, 40 nm thick poly(styrene sulfonate)-doped poly(ethylene-dioxythiophene) (PEDOT:PSS) (Bayer Baytron 4083) layers were spin-casted onto the ITO-coated glass substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The substrates were subsequently dried at 150 °C for 10 min in air and then transferred to a N2 glovebox. The active layers, composed of CS-DP and PC71BM (4:5 w/w), were dissolved in chlorobenzene with 3 vol% pyridine as an additive to generate 23 mg ml−1 blend solutions, which were spin-coated onto PEDOT:PSS films for 40 s. Then, the films were annealed at 120 °C for 5 min. The thicknesses of the active layers were measured by a profilometer. The ultra-thin conjugated poly electrolyte poly[9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)-propyl-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) layer was deposited by spin casting from a 0.02% (w/v) solution in methanol (at 2000 rpm for 30 s). Finally, Al (∼80 nm) was evaporated with a shadow mask as the top electrode. The effective area was measured to be 16 mm2.
Film and device characterization
UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the films on quartz substrates were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer. Tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were conducted on a NanoScope NS3A system (Digital Instrument). The J–V characteristics of the OPDs were recorded in the dark and under illumination. Data were collected using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the encapsulated devices were measured using an integrated system (Enlitech, Taiwan, China) and a lock-in amplifier with a current preamplifier under short-circuit conditions. The devices were illuminated by monochromatic light from a 75 W xenon lamp. The light intensity was determined using a calibrated silicon photodiode.
Results and discussions

Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the thin films of CS-DP, PC71BM, and the CS-DP:PC71BM blend. The pristine CS-DP in the film exhibits a broad absorption up to 1100 nm with two strong peaks at 520 and 852 nm, which were assigned to the porphyrin characterized Soret band and Q band, respectively.28–31 The much stronger and broader absorption in the NIR region from 750 to 1100 nm, compared with its monomeric analogues32 and the porphyrin reported previously,18 is ascribed to the facilitated intra-molecular charge transfer and stronger inter-molecular coupling induced by the improved electron coupling and delocalization of the two porphyrin macrocycles through the ethynyl linkages.

Photodetectors convert light to electrical power, which is similar to solar cells. The photocurrent density (Jph) of a photodetector depends on the intensity of light illuminated and the EQE.18 Therefore, high EQEs are a prerequisite for high performance OPDs. The EQE curves of the OPDs with different active layer thicknesses measured under short circuit conditions using a lock-in amplifier are presented in Fig. 3. It can be seen that the photodetectors are responsive up to 1000 nm with an EQE peak at 850 nm, matching well with the absorption spectrum of the CS-DP:PC71BM blend film. Furthermore, EQE values are enhanced gradually when increasing the thicknesses of the active layers. When the thickness is 115 nm, the maximum EQE at 850 nm is enhanced up to 48.0%, which is higher than that of the NIR SM OPDs reported previously.16,21,22 However, the EQEs are not enhanced remarkably with any further increase in the thickness of the active layer and are even reduced significantly when the active layer is thicker than 130 nm (data not shown). It is noted that the blend film of the optimized OPD is thicker than that of CS-DP-based solar cells.27 This is because EQEs depend on incident photo absorption and free charge carrier recombination. The EQEs will enhance when the increase in free charge carriers induced by more light absorption is greater than the decrease in free charge carriers induced by the charge recombination because of the thickness increase. In contrast, the power conversion efficiency of an organic solar cell is not only determined by the EQE, but also by the fill factor (FF), and the FF decreases sharply due to severe charge recombination if the active layer is too thick, which limits the thickness of an optimized active layer in OSCs to a moderate value of 95 nm.27

Generally, shot noise resulting from the dark current dominates the total noise current of an OPD. Therefore, a lower dark current will improve the performance of an OPD. As seen in Fig. 4 and Table 1, increasing the active layer thickness from 60 nm to 115 nm decreases the dark current (Jd) of the NIR OPDs gradually, from 1.01 × 10−9 and 1.21 × 10−5 A cm−2 to 4.25 × 10−10 and 7.11 × 10−7 A cm−2 at the biases of 0 and −2 V, respectively. A further increase in the thickness of the active layer cannot further reduce the Jd, and the Jd value of 10−10 A cm−2 at zero bias is the lowest for OPDs and is also comparable to well-established inorganic photodetectors.33 The current density–voltage characteristics in the dark under reverse and forward biases exhibit rectification behavior, with an enhanced rectification ratio from 1.50 × 104 to 4.74 × 105 at ±2 V, indicating the formation of well-made diodes with a thicker active layer. It is possible that the very low dark current of the OPDs is contributed to by the enhanced intramolecular electronic delocalization and intermolecular charge transport induced by the elongated dimeric porphyrin backbone.34–38

Responsivity (R) and detectivity (D*) are two important parameters used to evaluate a photodetector, and R is expressed as R = λ × EQE/1240, where λ is the wavelength of incident light.39,40 As shown in Fig. 5, the R value of the optimized photodetectors with 115 nm thick active layers is calculated to be 0.33 A W−1 at 850 nm at zero bias, which is among the best for solution-processed small molecule NIR OPDs to date.

Usually, shot noise from the dark current, Johnson noise, and thermal fluctuation ‘‘flicker’’ noise are the three noises limiting the detectivity (D*) of an OPD. Assuming that the shot noise due to the dark current dominates the total noise current of an OPD,41,42D* can be calculated using the equation D* = R/(2q × Jd)1/2 (Jones), where q is the absolute value of electron charge in Coulombs (1.602 × 10−19 C). Accordingly, the detectivity (D*) of the devices is calculated and shown in Fig. 5 and Table 1. OPDs with 115 nm active layers give the highest detectivities of 1013 Jones in a broad spectral region of 360–950 nm, with a detectivity of 5.73 × 1013 Jones at 850 nm at zero bias, which is one of the highest for solution-processed SM NIR OPDs to date. Meanwhile, a high detectivity of 3.56 × 1012 Jones is also achieved with a dark current density of 3.08 × 10−8 A cm−2 and an EQE of 51.5% at 850 nm for photodetectors under −0.2 V bias.
Conclusion
Panchromatic OPDs that are highly responsive in the NIR region based on a conjugated electron donor–acceptor dimeric porphyrin small molecule have been demonstrated. At room temperature and zero bias, the optimized OPDs show a broad spectral response range from 300 to 1000 nm, a low dark current density of 4.25 × 10−10 A cm−2, and a high EQE around 48.0% at 850 nm, leading to detectivities of over 1013 Jones from 360 to 950 nm, with a peak value of 5.73 × 1013 Jones at 850 nm, which are among the best for small molecule NIR photodetectors. The significantly improved performance is contributed to by enhanced intramolecular electronic delocalization and intermolecular charge transport, suggesting the potential of elongated porphyrin small molecules in NIR photodetectors.
