    , Accepted 23rd March 2021First published on 24th March 2021AbstractHalide perovskites (HPs) are promising materials for preparing nonvolatile memory and artificial synapse devices. However, the instability and toxicity of lead HPs seriously restrict their further application. Herein, a lead-free and air-stable Ag/polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)/Cs2AgBiBr6/ITO device is fabricated, which exhibits typical resistive switching (RS) characteristics and synaptic behaviors, including long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and spike-dependent plasticity. The ion migration of Br− and Ag+ in Cs2AgBiBr6 led to the formation and fracture of a conductive filament. Notably, no obvious decay in the device performance was observed after being directly exposed to the ambient environment for 20 days, indicating that the device exhibits good environmental stability. Furthermore, the recognition rate reaches 91.3% by using the MNIST handwritten data set. This air-stable and lead-free device provides a new candidate for the next generation of neuromorphic computation based on halide perovskites.
Introduction
Organometal halide perovskites (OHPs, CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) have been attracting more and more attention of researchers due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties including adjustable bandgap, long carrier lifetime, long diffusion length and high optical absorption and are widely used in optoelectronics.1,2 Since the first OHP-based artificial synapse was reported by Xu et al. in 2015,3 various perovskite materials have been applied to fabricate synapse devices.2,4–7 However, the intrinsic instability of OHPs to heat and moisture greatly limits the practical application of OHP-based synaptic devices in neuromorphic computing.8,9
Replacing the organic components in OHPs with inorganic cations is one of the effective ways to improve the stability. For example, it has been illustrated that CsPbX3 not only inherits the excellent characteristics of OHPs, but also exhibits excellent stability.10,11 Lin et al.12 demonstrated the implementation of UV-absorbing inorganic perovskite CsPbCl3 in photonic artificial synapses which exhibit the necessary synaptic functions. Wu et al.11 reported a CsPbBr3-based memristor, revealing that the device not only exhibits impressive resistance switching (RS) behaviour at a low working voltage and good stability but also possesses advantages of solution and room-temperature processability for flexible devices. Although decent progress has been made in the application of CsPbX3, the toxicity of lead is still a serious environmental problem. Plenty of attempts have been made to eliminate this disadvantage by replacing lead (Pb) ions with bismuth (Bi) or tin (Sn) ions. Sun et al.13 enhanced the structural stability of Cs-based inorganic halide perovskites through partial incorporation of Bi into α-CsPbI3 to fabricate the Ag/PMMA/(Cs3Bi2I9)0.4–(CsPbI3)0.6/Pt device, revealing RS characteristics and synaptic plasticity. Han et al.14 reported a CsSnI3 lead-free all-inorganic halide perovskite (HP)-based memristor with typical RS characteristics. But unfortunately, Sn2+ in the HPs is easily oxidized to the more stable Sn4+ under ambient conditions.15 So far, full replacement of Pb with Bi or Sn while maintaining air stability has not proved to be a success. Therefore, looking for lead-free and air-stable perovskite substitutes to further develop optoelectronic devices is a direction worth studying.
Lead-free double perovskites, especially Cs2AgBiBr6, have become one of the most promising alternatives to OHPs due to their simple fabrication method, environmental stability and low toxicity.16–18 High-sensitivity and air-stable photodetectors based on Cs2AgBiBr6 thin films were reported with a large linear dynamic range of 193 dB, a fast response time of ≈17 ns and a specific detectivity of 3.29 × 1012 Jones.18 Solar cells based on Cs2AgBiBr6 reached a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.11%.19 However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no relevant report on the application of Cs2AgBiBr6 in the field of artificial synapses.
In this work, we demonstrated an artificial synapse based on a double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 film with a vertical structure of Ag/polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)/Cs2AgBiBr6/ITO. Typical synaptic behaviours were successfully exhibited by the device. The formation and rupture of a conductive filament which was due to the ion migration of Br− and Ag+ in Cs2AgBiBr6 led to the bipolar I–V curve and synaptic behaviour simulation. It is worth noting that this synaptic device exhibited excellent stability. No obvious decay in the device performance was observed after being directly exposed to the environment for 20 days. For the handwriting recognition, the device reached an accuracy of 91.3% based on the LTP/D experimental data through the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) data set.
Results and discussion
The Cs2AgBiBr6 film was synthesized by a simple one-step spin-coating method and treated by a typical low-pressure-assisted (LPA) method according to a previous report.20 In brief, CsBr, AgBr and BiBr3 with a molar ratio of 2:1:1 were dissolved in DMSO and stirred at 60 °C to form a precursor solution. 50 μL of 0.5 M Cs2AgBiBr6 solution was spin-coated on the ITO substrate, and treated by the LPA method before annealing in order to obtain a pinhole-free film. Fig. 1a shows the surface morphology of the obtained Cs2AgBiBr6 film. It can be seen that the film was dense and non-porous. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectra (EDS) clearly indicate that the Cs, Ag, Bi and Br elements were uniformly distributed on the surface of the film (Fig. 1b). Fig. 1c presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the film. The peaks at 13.7°, 15.9°, 22.5°, 26.5°, 27.5°, 31.9°, 35.7°, 39.4°, and 45.7° are assigned to the (111), (002), (022), (113), (222), (004), (024), (224) and (044) planes of the crystalline Cs2AgBiBr6, respectively, which agrees very well with the crystal structure reported by Woodwards et al.21 In the Cs2AgBiBr6 crystal, Br ions acted as a shared bridging unit to alternately connect AgBr6 and BiBr6 octahedra (Fig. 1d), resulting in the formation of a cubic structure with a lattice constant of 11.2712 Å.21 The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) also clearly confirm the existence of Cs+, Ag+, Bi3+ and Br− (Fig. S1a–d, ESI†).20 The above-mentioned results firmly demonstrate that the Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite film was successfully synthesized.

The structure of the device based on the Cs2AgBiBr6 film is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2a, which is a simple metal–semiconductor–metal vertical sandwich structure and facilitates building large-scale synaptic arrays. The Ag electrode with a thickness of 60 nm was deposited via thermal evaporation as the top electrode, while the ITO glass substrate was the bottom electrode. The thickness of the Cs2AgBiBr6 thin film was about 240 nm via the cross-sectional image of the device (Fig. 2a). A thin polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) layer was introduced between the perovskite layer and the Ag electrode with the purpose of avoiding potential reactions between these two layers or the penetration of the Ag electrode.22 However, the thickness of PMMA could not be clearly seen in the cross-sectional image in Fig. 2a, possibly because the PMMA layer was too thin to observe. Fig. 2b displays the resistive switching (RS) performance of the device, which is observed by applying voltage sweeps in an ambient environment. The device was initially at a high resistance state (HRS) before the voltage sweep. When a low positive voltage sweep (0 V → +0.5 V) was applied, the device transferred from the HRS to the low resistance state (LRS) and remained in the LRS during the reverse voltage sweep in the range of +0.5 V → 0 V, corresponding to a SET process. When a negative voltage sweep (0 V → −0.5 V) was applied, the device switched back to the HRS, corresponding to a RESET process. Besides, the endurance and retention characteristics of the device were measured. Fig. S2a (ESI†) shows the endurance for 110 successive cycles with a voltage read at 0.1 V and the on/off ratio is always larger than 10. Also, the LRS and HRS of the device were maintained for up to ≈103 s without significant degradation (Fig. S2b, ESI†). The device showed good reproducibility of resistance switching behaviour when consecutive SET and RESET processes were performed.

(b) Typical current–voltage (I–V) curve of the Cs2AgBiBr6-based device in a semilogarithmic scale under replicated positive and negative sweeps. (c) I–V curves under 10 positive voltage dual sweeps (0 V → +0.5 V → 0 V). (d) I–V curves under 10 negative voltage dual sweeps (0 V → −0.5 V → 0 V). 
The consecutively tunable resistance states are crucial for a memristor to simulate the functionalities of a biological synapse. Fig. 2c presents the current–voltage (I–V) curves obtained by applying continuous positive voltage dual sweeps (0 V → +0.5 V → 0 V) on the device. As the number of voltage sweeps increased, the current first increased and then gradually reached a maximum. During the following continuous negative voltage dual sweeps (0 V → −0.5 V → 0 V), the current gradually decreased with the increase of voltage sweep number, as shown in Fig. 2d. These results demonstrate that the Ag/PMMA/Cs2AgBiBr6/ITO device exhibited the continuously tunable conductance states, which resembles the synaptic plasticity of the biological synapse.
Biological synapses serve as a bridge between two neurons to transmit information and are the basis of learning and memory.23 Pre-synaptic neurons, post-synaptic neurons and synaptic cleft are the components of a biological synapse (Fig. 3a). In our device, the top Ag electrode, PMMA/Cs2AgBiBr6 layers and grounded bottom ITO glass electrodes simulated the role of pre-synaptic neurons, synaptic cleft and post-synaptic neurons, respectively (Fig. 3a). 50 consecutive positive voltage pulses (+0.5 V, 300 μs) for potentiation were applied to the device, followed by 50 negative voltage pulses (−0.5 V, 300 μs) for depression, to evaluate the modulable synaptic plasticity (Fig. 3b). The excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) increased with the number of positive voltage pulses, and decreased with the number of negative voltage pulses. They are analogous to the long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) behaviours of biological synapses. Fig. 3c shows the evaluation of conductance values read out at 0.1 V during 7 continuous cycles of potentiation and depression processes, which clearly illustrates the excellent response reproducibility of our device to the voltage pulses.

(c) Evolution of conductance in 7 continuous cycles of potentiation and depression. 
Paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) is one of the most representative synaptic behaviours in short-term plasticity (STP). This PPF feature could be simulated by applying two repetitive voltage pulses (0.5 V, 300 μs) with different pulse intervals to our device, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4a. Obviously, decreasing the pulse interval (Δt) leaded to the much higher EPSC excited by the second pulse (A2) than that caused by the first pulse (A1). The PPF ratio of A1 and A2 was calculated by the following equation: PPF ratio = A2/A1 × 100%(1)Fig. 4a presents the dependence of the calculated PPF ratios on the pulse interval (Δt). It is clear that the facilitation effect of PPF became more obvious when Δt was smaller. The PPF ratio reached 130% when Δt is 0.2 ms and decreased to 100% when Δt is 1.2 ms. The data can be well fitted with a double exponential decay function:24 y = y0 + C1exp(−Δt/τ1) + C2exp(−Δt/τ2)(2)where τ1 = 9.97 ms and τ2 = 53.61 ms are the characteristic relaxation time and C is the initial facilitation magnitude.

The illustration shows the shapes of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic pulses. The reading voltage applied above is 0.1 V. 
In biological synapses, the change of synaptic weight is also related to spike frequency, spike amplitude and spike width.25 On the basis of successful simulation of PPF behaviour, the spiking-rate dependent plasticity (SRDP) behaviour was simulated by applying different sequences of voltage pulses with different frequencies (0.2, 0.7, 2, and 3 kHz) to the device. Fig. 4b shows the EPSC response of the device to the applied pulses. It is obvious that the EPSC value increased with the increase of the pulse frequency if the pulse number in the sequence was the same. Increasing the pulse number in the sequence also led to an increase of the EPSC response. In order to better compare the changes of EPSC under different frequency stimulations, we extracted the EPSC value after the 1st (d1) and 10th (d10) stimulations in a sequence of 10 voltage pulses. The ratio of d10 to d1 was used to represent the change of synapse weight, as shown in Fig. 4c. As the frequency of the pulse increased, the d10/d1 ratio increased significantly. A high ratio of 1100% was reached at a frequency of 3 kHz. Fig. 4d shows the simulation of spike-number-dependent plasticity (SNDP) behaviour. The increase in the pulse numbers resulted in a larger EPSC response. The SNDP ratio (dn/d1) could reach up to 1500% when 25 spikes were applied, which was 2.5 times higher than that when only 5 pulses were applied (Fig. 4e). Furthermore, spike-width-dependent plasticity (SWDP, Fig. S3a, ESI†) and spike-voltage-dependent plasticity (SVDP, Fig. S3b, ESI†) behaviours could also be realized by changing the voltage width and amplitude of the pulse, respectively.
Spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP) plays an important role in human learning and memory rules. STDP of biological synapses can be divided into symmetric Hebbian and antisymmetric Hebbian learning rules, which are expressed as follows:26,27 ΔW = Aexp(−Δt2/τ2) + ΔW0(3) ΔW = Aexp(−Δt/τ) + ΔW0(4)where A and τ are the scaling factor and time constant, respectively, and ΔW is the relative change of the synaptic weight [ΔW = (Wpost − Wpre)/Wpre]. By controlling the pulse intervals (Δt), the anti-Hebbian STDP learning rule was successfully simulated in our Cs2AgBiBr6-based device as shown in Fig. 4f. The applied pre- and post-synaptic pulses are shown in the inset of Fig. 4f. When the pre-synaptic pulse arrived before the post-synaptic pulse (Δt > 0), LTP occurred in the device, and ΔW increased more obviously as Δt decreased. In contrast, LTD occurred if the pre-synaptic pulse arrived after the post-synaptic pulse (Δt < 0). The experimental data of ΔW and Δt could be well fitted with the exponential decay function (eqn (4)) in the antisymmetric Hebbian learning rules.
The above-mentioned results confirm the capability of our device as an artificial synapse. Then the mechanism was investigated. One of the I–V curves under the positive sweep in Fig. 2b was replotted to double logarithmic scales (Fig. S4a and b, ESI†). In the HRS state, curve fitting indicated a current that is linearly related to the voltage with a slope of 1.23 at low bias, corresponding to Ohmic law conduction (I ∝ V).22,28 When the voltage is higher, the space charge limited current (SCLC, I ∝ Vn, n > 2) conduction occurred, which is verified by the slope of 2.04. When the device transferred from the HRS to LRS, Ohmic conduction was again observed with a slope of 1.01, indicating that the formation of conductive filaments occurred in this transition process. It has already been illustrated that the formation/rupture of the conductive filament was induced by ion-migration in most hybrid lead perovskite devices.2,3,29 In order to exclude the contribution of the Ag electrode to the formation of the conductive filament in our case, an Au/PMMA/Cs2AgBiBr6/ITO device was prepared, which exhibited a similar switching phenomenon (Fig. S5, ESI†). It seems that Br− and Ag+ ions in Cs2AgBiBr6 are more likely to migrate according to the difference of energy barrier {Br (0.43 eV) < Ag (0.89 eV) < Cs (1.41 eV) < Bi (3.36 eV)}.2,28,30 Thus, the migration of Br− and Ag+ ions in the Cs2AgBiBr6 film caused the formation/rupture of the conductive filaments, which explained the observed RS behaviour and consecutively tunable conductance states of our Ag/PMMA/Cs2AgBiBr6/ITO device (Fig. S4c and d, ESI†).
As mentioned in the Introduction section, the reported artificial synapse based on OHPs suffered from the problem of instability. We investigated the stability of our Cs2AgBiBr6-based device by keeping the unsealed device in an ambient environment (the humidity was about 40–50% and the temperature was around 25 °C) for 20 days. Fig. 5a shows the initial XRD patterns of the Cs2AgBiBr6 film and those after 20 days. No obvious change was observed. The RS performance of the device was almost the same with an unaltered on/off ratio after 20 days of storage, as illustrated in Fig. 5b. Additionally, the repeatable I–V curves obtained by applying over 9 consecutive cycles of voltage demonstrate the robustness of the device after storing in air (Fig. S6, ESI†). Fig. 5c shows the LTP and LTD characteristics of the device before and after storage. These results further confirm the robustness and good reproducibility of our Cs2AgBiBr6-based device. Energy efficiency is also an important feature of artificial synapses for practical application. For our device, a voltage pulse of 0.3 V with a width of 80 μs triggers an EPSC of 7.86 μA (Fig. S7, ESI†), resulting in an energy consumption of 188.6 pJ. This energy consumption was lower than those of most of the reported perovskite-based devices, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†).

Artificial synapses have great potential in neuromorphic computing chips such as digital and image recognition, based on their advantages of low power consumption and fast calculation speed. Here, a three-layer neural network was designed to demonstrate the potential of our artificial synapse device in neuromorphic computing and the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) database was used to train and test the artificial neural network. Note that the LTP/LTD characteristics of the artificial device mentioned in Fig. 3c were used to establish the learning framework. Fig. 6a and b show an example of the recognition process with the “3” input pattern. Detailed information on the simulation process is given in the ‘Experimental’ section. 6000 images which were not included in the training images were used to test the trained network, the recognition rate of 10 hand-written letters was obtained. In order to confirm the reliability of the neural network, the mapping image of the conductance matrix was also obtained. Fig. 6c illustrates the synaptic weight mapping images after the training with digits “2”, “3”, “5”, “6”, “7” and “8” in the neural network. With this method, we completely trained our network to reach a recognition accuracy of 83.4% after 5000 learning phases while finally reaching up to 91.3% at 60000 learning phases (Fig. 6d). The above calculation processes were implemented in Python.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a vertically structured device was fabricated by using lead-free double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6. The Ag/PMMA/Cs2AgBiBr6/ITO device shows credible resistive switching characteristics at low operation voltage. Typical synaptic behaviours such as LTP/LTD, PPF, SRDP and STDP were successfully simulated using this device. More importantly, the device showed excellent stability, reproductivity and low energy consumption. The pattern recognition accuracy reached 91.3% which is simulated by using the MNIST data set. We believe that this work will promote the development of lead-free double perovskites for fabricating environment-friendly and robust artificial synapses.
Experimental
Materials
Cesium bromide (CsBr, 99.9%) and silver bromide (AgBr, 98%) were sourced by Aladdin Company. Bismuth bromide (BiBr3, 99%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, [C5H8O2]n), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%) and chlorobenzene (CB, C6H5Cl, 99.8%) were purchased from J&K company.
Preparation of Cs2AgBiBr6 solution
0.5 M Cs2AgBiBr6 precursor was prepared by mixing CsBr (2 mmol, 426 mg), AgBr (1 mmol, 188 mg) and BiBr3 (1 mmol, 449 mg) in 2 mL of DMSO, and stirred at 60 °C for a few hours until the powders dissolved completely. A 0.22 μm filter was used to filter the precursor solution to obtain a clear and transparent yellow solution.
Device fabrication
Indium-tin oxide (ITO) glass was first cleaned with deionized water, acetone, alcohol and isopropyl alcohol by ultrasonic waves for 20 min, respectively, and dried using nitrogen gas for further use. Then, the ITO glass was treated with ultraviolet ozone for 20 min before use. The Cs2AgBiBr6 film was deposited by a one-step spin-coating method. First, 50 μL of 0.5 M Cs2AgBiBr6 solution was spin-coated on the ITO substrate at a low speed of 500 rpm for 5 s, followed by a high speed of 3000 rpm for 50 s to obtain a transparent yellow film. Then, the film was quickly transferred to a low-pressure chamber and kept for 10 min. After that, the film was annealed at 285 °C for 10 min. After cooling down to room temperature, 30 μL of 5 mg mL−1 PMMA dissolved in CB was spin-coated on the as-prepared Cs2AgBiBr6 film at 3000 rpm for 20 s and annealed at 120 °C for 15 min. Finally, 60 nm Ag was deposited by thermal evaporation to accomplish the fabrication of the Ag/PMMA/Cs2AgBiBr6/ITO artificial synapse device.
Pattern recognition simulation
The three-layer neural network consists of 784 input neurons (28 × 28 pixels), 25 hidden neurons and 10 output neurons (from 0 to 9) with full connection through two synaptic weight arrays (784 × 25 and 25 × 10) as depicted in Fig. 6a. During the training process, each pixel (Xi) of the MNIST pattern was fed to input neurons in a certain order. Then, the generated input vector (Xi) functions via the synaptic weight matrix (W±ij, where i and j are the number of input neurons and output neurons, respectively) and the connected output neurons convert the current  to the voltage (Vj) using virtual ground mode operational amplifiers, and then the output vector was transformed by the sigmoid activation function (Oj = (1 + e−Vj)−1). Lastly, the backpropagation learning algorithm was used to update the synaptic weight according to the difference between the output values of 10 output neurons and the label value of the input MNIST pattern. The above calculation processes were implemented in Python.
Characterization
The surface and cross-sectional morphology images of the synaptic device were obtained using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Zeiss, Germi 450). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite composite film were obtained using a PAN analytical EMPTREANS3 diffractometer equipped with a monochromatized Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5418 Å). An X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Scienta Omicron R3000) was employed to acquire the composition of the perovskite film. All the electrical characteristics of the device were tested using a Keithley 4200A semiconductor parameter analyzer and a probe station. The DC voltage sweep and voltage pulses were applied to the Ag electrode while the ITO bottom electrode was grounded. Notably, all the characterization tests were performed under an ambient atmosphere and at room temperature.
