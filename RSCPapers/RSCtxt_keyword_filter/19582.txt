    , Accepted 10th June 2013First published on 11th June 2013AbstractTwo novel porphyrin dyes (Q1 and Q2) bearing alkoxyl chains with a carbazole moiety as the electron donor have been synthesized and utilized as sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Compared with Q2, the molecule of Q1 has an additional ethynylene bridge between the carbazole moiety and the porphyrin framework. Photophysical and electrochemical properties of the two dyes were investigated by UV-vis, fluorescence spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. DFT calculations indicated that Q2 has a more twisted non-planar conformation associated with a smaller π conjugation size because of the absence of ethynylene bridge, which resulted in its better solubility and larger amount of adsorption on TiO2. Compared with Q1, Q2 showed better photovoltaic performance, with a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 11.3 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.68 V, and a fill factor (ff) of 0.71, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency of 5.51% under standard global AM 1.5 solar light conditions. The additional ethynylene bridge in Q1 extends the absorption bands to a longer wavelength region with the absorption threshold of 743 nm on the TiO2 film compared with that of 681 nm for Q2, but the cell efficiency is decreased to 2.22%, which may be ascribed to the worse solubility and stronger aggregation tendency resulting from the better molecule planarity. These results indicate that the extension of the absorption bands to a longer wavelength region by the introduction of an additional ethynylene bridge may result in worse solubility and more severe aggregation, and thus decrease the cell efficiency. For the design of efficient DSSC sensitizers, these contradictory effects must be fully considered and well balanced.
Introduction
Employment of inexhaustive solar energy is a promising choice to solve the energy shortage problem. In this respect, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention during the past years due to their low production cost, easy fabrication and relatively high solar energy conversion efficiency.1 In 1991, Grätzel et al. reported the excellent performance of DSSCs utilizing ruthenium complexes as the sensitizers.1a Since then, increasing efforts have been devoted to the design and syntheses of efficient DSSC sensitizers.2 The advantages of ruthenium complexes include broad absorption bands and appropriate excited-state energy levels for electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2, the most commonly used semiconductor in DSSCs.3 Whereas, the cost and environmental concern limit their practical applications. Consequently, in recent years, increasing interests have been focused on the development of new efficient organic sensitizers because of their advantages of low cost, high molar absorption coefficient, and facile modulation of the properties by the modification of the molecular structures.4 A typical organic sensitizer has a D-π-A framework, with the electron donor (D) and the electron acceptor (A) linked by a conjugated π bridge (π).5 Thus, organic dyes based on coumarin, triphenylamine, carbazole, thiophene, polyene, cyanine, hemicyanine, squaraine and phthalocyanine moieties have been explored as sensitizers for DSSCs.6–14 In this respect, we have developed various efficient dyes incorporating indoline, isophorone and benzothiadiazole units.15
Inspired by the efficient energy and electron transfer behavior in the light-harvesting antenna of natural systems,16 porphyrin derivatives17 and analogues18 have been widely used in photovoltaic devices. Porphyrin based compounds have several intrinsic advantages such as good photostability and rigid molecular structure with large absorption coefficients in the visible region.19 Furthermore, due to the presence of multiple reactive sites, including four meso and eight β-positions, their electrochemical and photophysical properties can be easily modulated by peripheral substituents and inner metal complexation.20 Thus, numerous porphyrins have been synthesized and used as DSSC sensitizers.21 Among these, a push–pull type porphyrin dye with diarylamine and ethynylbenzoic acid substituents at meso positions has been reported to achieve a PCE of 12.3%,22 which remains the highest value for DSSCs so far. In spite of these successful examples, high performance porphyrin sensitizers are still rather scarce, and correlations between cell performance and the porphyrin structures still remain relatively unexplored.
In an attempt to create efficient porphyrin dyes and further understand the performance–structure correlations, we have synthesized a number of porphyrins with various electron donors, and demonstrated that photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs can be optimized by means of modulating the molecular orbital energy levels by variation of the numbers and types of electron donors.23 As an electron donor, carbazole has been introduced to various organic dyes for the syntheses of efficient DSSC sensitizers,8 but examples of carbazole containing porphyrin dyes are extremely rare.24 In this work, two porphyrin sensitizers, Q1 and Q2 (Scheme 1) were synthesized by introducing a carbazole moiety as the electron donor, and long alkoxyl chains were introduced with the purpose to increase the solubility and suppress dye aggregation,25 and thus improve the cell performance. And in each of the dyes, a 4-ethynylbenzoic acid group was introduced to one of the meso-positions as the electron acceptor and anchoring moiety.
 Scheme 1  Molecular structures of the porphyrin sensitizers. 
It has been demonstrated that the incorporation of an ethynylene bridge can increase conjugate lengths of the dyes, thus the absorption bands can be broadened to a longer wavelength region, which may improve the DSSC efficiency.21d Compared with Q2, an extra ethynylene bridge was introduced into the molecule of Q1, with the aim to investigate the effect of the ethynylene unit on the cell efficiency.
Absorption spectra and electrochemical analyses of Q1 and Q2 indicate that the HOMO and LUMO levels are suitable for DSSC sensitizers. The extra ethynylene bridge in Q1 extends the absorption bands to a longer wavelength region, but decreases the DSSC efficiency. The overall photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies (PCE) of the DSSCs based on Q1 and Q2 are 2.22% and 5.51%, respectively.
Experimental section
Materials and reagents
All reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification unless otherwise noted. THF was dried over 4 Å molecular sieves, and distilled under nitrogen from sodium benzophenone prior to use. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) was vacuum-dried for 48 h. The transparent FTO conducting glass (fluorine-doped SnO2, transmission >90% in the visible range, sheet resistance 15Ω/square) and the TiO2 paste was purchased from Geao Science and Educational Co. Ltd. The FTO conducting glass was washed with a detergent solution, deionized water, ethanol, and acetone successively under ultrasonication for 20 min before use. 4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)benzaldehyde26 and 9-(4-ethynylphenyl)carbazole27 were prepared according to reported procedures.
Equipment and apparatus

1H NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker AM 400 spectrometer. HRMS measurements were performed using a Waters LCT Premier XE spectrometer. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 100 spectrophotometer and fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. The cyclic voltammograms of the dyes were obtained in acetonitrile with a Versastat II electrochemical workstation (Princeton Applied Research) using 0.1 M TBAPF6 (Aldrich) as the supporting electrolyte, the sensitizer attached to a nanocrystalline TiO2 film deposited on the conducting FTO glass as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and a regular calomel electrode in saturated KCl solution as the reference electrode. The scan rate was 100 mV s−1.
Photovoltaic measurements were performed by employing an AM 1.5 solar simulator equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp (model no. 91160, Oriel). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a Newport Oriel PV reference cell system (model 91150 V). I–V curves were obtained by applying an external bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a model 2400 source meter (Keithley Instruments, Inc. USA). The voltage step and delay time of the photocurrent were 10 mV and 40 ms, respectively. Action spectra of the incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the solar cells were obtained with a Newport-74125 system (Newport Instruments). The intensity of monochromatic light was measured with a Si detector (Newport-71640). The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of all the DSSCs were performed using a Zahner IM6e Impedance Analyzer (ZAHNER-Elektrik GmbH & CoKG, Kronach, Germany), with the frequency range 0.1 Hz–100 kHz and the alternative signal of 10 mV.
Fabrication of the solar cells
The procedure for preparation of TiO2 electrodes and fabrication of the sealed cells for photovoltaic measurements were adapted from that reported by Grätzel and co-workers.28 A screen-printed double layer of TiO2 particles was used as the photoelectrode. The detailed procedure was reported in our previous work.23 Then the photoelectrode was dipped into a 0.2 mM porphyrin/ethanol solution for 12 h at room temperature. The counter electrode was also prepared according to our previously reported procedure.23 Finally, the DSSCs were assembled, with the electrolyte solution containing 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium iodide (BMII), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (volume ratio 1:1).

Results and discussion
Molecular design and syntheses
One of the major unfavorable factors for DSSCs is the formation of dye aggregates on the semiconductor surface.21 4-(Dodecyloxy)phenyl groups were introduced to the porphyrin meso positions to improve solubility of the dyes in organic solvents and suppress dye aggregation. Generally, organic DSSC dyes have a D-π-A structure.6–14 In the molecules of Q1 and Q2 (Scheme 2), carbazole and 4-ethynylbenzoic acid moieties were introduced to the porphyrin meso-positions as the electron donor and the electron acceptor, respectively. An extra ethynylene bridge was incorporated into Q1 with the purpose of investigating the effect of π framework extension on cell performance.

Intermediates 2a and 2b were prepared by TFA-promoted condensation of corresponding dipyrromethanes and aldehydes in CH2Cl2, followed by bromination with various equivalents of NBS. The ethynyl group was attached to the meso-position via Sonogashira coupling reactions in satisfactory yields. All the intermediates and target porphyrins were fully characterized by 1H NMR and HRMS (Fig. S1–S24, ESI†).
Absorption spectra in THF and on TiO2 films
Absorption spectra of Q1 and Q2 in THF (Fig. 1a) show intense Soret bands at 449 nm and 444 nm, respectively. The Q bands of Q1 were observed at 609 nm and 660 nm, and corresponding peaks for Q2 were observed at 575 and 628 nm. Thus, the strong Soret bands and medium Q bands of these two dyes may fulfil the requirement for DSSC sensitizers. Compared with Q2, the π-conjugation system in Q1 is enlarged by an extra ethynylene bridge, which results in a pronounced red shift and broadening of both Soret and Q bands, with a long wavelength absorption threshold of 695 nm. In comparison with most reported porphyrin dyes without an ethynylene bridge,21,23Q1 shows obviously red-shifted absorption maxima and threshold wavelengths. The fluorescence spectra of Q1 and Q2 were also checked in THF (Fig. 1b), and the emission wavelengths also vary with a trend similar to that of the absorption bands.

Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the dye-loaded TiO2 films (∼5 μm) with a bare TiO2 film as the reference. Comparable absorption bands are observed for Q1 and Q2, with the intense Soret bands at 452 nm and 448 nm, respectively. These bands are red-shifted compared with corresponding solution spectra. And the absorption of the films of Q2 is significantly stronger than those of Q1, which is indicative of a larger amount of Q2 adsorbed on the TiO2 films. It is noteworthy that the absorption bands of the films are broadened and red-shifted compared with those observed in the THF solutions, which will result in higher light harvesting efficiencies. In addition, the presence of the blue shoulders of the Soret bands was observed, which may result from the solvent effect, deprotonation of the carboxylic acid upon dye attachment to the TiO2 surface,29 and/or H-aggregation of the dye molecules.30

Electrochemical properties
Suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels are required for DSSC sensitizers to ensure efficient electron injection and dye regeneration processes. To evaluate the possibility of electron transfer from the excited dye molecule to the conduction band of TiO2, cyclic voltammograms (Fig. 3) were measured for the dyes absorbed on the TiO2 films, and the data are summarized in Table 1. The cyclic voltammogram of Q1 shows two oxidation waves at 0.87 and 1.31 V, and Q2 also shows two redox couples at 0.84 and 1.38 V, respectively. The first oxidation process at the lower potential may be attributed to the oxidation of the carbazole unit, and the second one may correspond to the oxidation of the porphyrin unit. Thus the HOMO energy levels observed for Q1 and Q2 are 0.87 and 0.84 V (vs. NHE), respectively. The absorption thresholds for dyes Q1 and Q2 on the TiO2 films (Fig. 2) are 743 and 681 nm, respectively, corresponding to the band gap energies (E0–0) of 1.67 and 1.82 V, respectively. Thus, the estimated LUMO energy levels calculated from EHOMO − E0–0, are −0.80 and −0.98 V, respectively. The HOMO levels for these two dyes are almost the same, which can be attributed to the similar electron-donating ability of the donors in the two dyes. And introduction of the additional ethynylene bridge into Q1 decreases the HOMO–LUMO energy gap, which is consistent with red shift of the absorption bands, and a more negative LUMO level. As shown in Fig. 4, the LUMO levels of these dyes are both more negative than the conduction edge of TiO2, indicating that the electron injection from the excited states of the dyes to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 is possible. In addition, the HOMO levels of Q1 and Q2 are both more positive than the oxidation potential of the I−/I3− redox couple, indicating that the energy levels are thermodynamically favourable for the regeneration of the dyes from the oxidized states by accepting electrons from I− ions presented in the electrolyte of the DSSCs.31 Hence, both of Q1 and Q2 may serve as DSSC sensitizers. Q1 and Q2 have very similar HOMO levels, indicating that they have similar driving force for the dye regeneration process. On the other hand, Q2 has a more negative LUMO level than that of Q1, which will result in a larger driving force for the electron injection process. Thus, by considering the molecular orbital levels, it can be anticipated that Q2 sensitized solar cells will have higher efficiency than that of Q1. This is in agreement with the photovoltaic performance results (vide infra).

DFT calculations
To get further insight into the molecular structure and electron distribution of the dyes, their geometries were optimized by density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level with Gaussian 09 program package.32 From the optimized conformation (Fig. 5), we can find that the dihedral angle between the phenyl unit and the porphyrin macrocycle is 71.1° for Q2, but corresponding angle for Q1 has a very small value of 0.3°, indicating that Q2 has a relatively nonplanar structure, and Q1 is relatively planar. As is well known, for a nonplanar and distorted DSSC dye, dye aggregation and charge recombination could be efficiently suppressed, which will be favorable for enhancing cell efficiency.33 Thus, compared to Q1, Q2 could be considered as a better dye due to its relatively nonplanar structure (vide infra). Corresponding molecular orbitals for Q1 and Q2 are shown in Fig. 5. The HOMO orbitals are delocalized between the donors and the porphyrin macrocycles, and the LUMO orbitals are delocalized between the porphyrin macrocycles and the carboxyl groups. Hence, excitation of the electron from HOMO to LUMO can induce electron redistribution from the donor to the anchoring moiety, thus enabling electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2.

Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
From the above mentioned results, it can be anticipated that Q1 and Q2 may be employed as DSSC dyes. Thus, DSSCs were fabricated based on these two dyes. Fig. 6 shows the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of incident wavelength. These two porphyrin dyes have moderate IPCE values in a large wavelength range of 400–750 nm. Large gaps between the Soret and Q bands have been observed in absorption spectra of the porphyrins in THF, but this feature is not evident in the IPCE curves because the absorption bands are broadened on the TiO2 film, and the scattering by TiO2 nanoparticles increases the photocurrents in the relatively weak absorption region. Compared with Q2, the IPCE of Q1 is broadened to 750 nm, which is in good agreement with the UV-vis absorption spectra on TiO2 (Fig. 2). This result indicates that introduction of an additional ethynylene bridge is a good approach for extending IPCE to the near IR-region. In spite of this, the absorbance of Q1 on TiO2 films is much smaller than that of Q2 in most of the wavelength range, which may be ascribed to the worse solubility and less adsorption amount of Q1. Consequently, the maximum IPCE value of Q1 is much smaller than that of Q2 which may result in lower Jsc of Q1 (vide infra).
 Fig. 6  IPCE curves of DSSCs based on the porphyrin dyes. 

Fig. 7 shows the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs, and the photovoltaic parameters of short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and solar energy to electricity conversion efficiencies (η) are listed in Table 2. The efficiencies were obtained to be 2.22% and 5.51% for Q1 and Q2, respectively. The higher efficiency observed for Q2 may be ascribed to the better solubility, larger adsorption amount, suppressed dye aggregation and more suitable energy levels as mentioned above. The addition of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) is one of the most efficient approaches of suppressing the aggregation effect.34 Thus, we used CDCA as a coadsorbant, but no increased efficiency was obtained. This observation may be attributed to the weakened absorption spectrum caused by the addition of CDCA (Fig. S25, ESI†), which decreased the light harvesting ability of the dyes and thus balanced the effect of CDCA on suppressing the aggregation of the dyes.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
For better understanding of the correlation between charge-transfer processes and photovoltaic properties, electrochemical impedance spectral (EIS) analyses were measured in the dark at a forward bias of 0.70 V. For Q1 (Fig. 8a), three semicircles could be clearly observed. The first one is associated with the charge transfer at Pt/redox (I−/I3−) interface, the second one is large and related to charge transfer at dye-sensitized TiO2/redox (I−/I3−) interface, and the third one is associated with the Nernst diffusion of I3− in the electrolyte.35 However, only two semicircles can be observed for Q2 (Fig. 8a), because the Nernst diffusion within the electrolyte is overlapped by the intermediate-frequency large semicircle. This observation is indicative of fast electron transport and long electron lifetime in the TiO2 film. The radius of the second semicircle for Q1 is smaller than that of Q2, indicating that charge recombination is suppressed in the cell based on Q2.
 Fig. 8  The electrochemical impedance spectra of (a) Nyquist plots and (b) Bode phase plots for the DSSCs prepared from the porphyrin dyes. 
In the Bode phase plots (Fig. 8b), the middle frequency peak corresponds to charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. Compared with the DSSC based on Q1, a lower frequency peak was observed for Q2, indicative of a longer electron lifetime.36 Thus, the corresponding lifetime values were found to be 11.5 ms and 29.1 ms for Q1 and Q2, respectively. The longer lifetime observed for Q2 is indicative of a more effective suppression of the back reaction between the injected electrons and the electrolyte, resulting in improvement of Voc due to the reduced charge recombination rate. The EIS results are in good agreement with the photovoltaic performance as indicated in Fig. 7.
Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized two novel porphyrin dyes Q1 and Q2 bearing alkoxyl chains, and a carbazole moiety was introduced as the electron donor. In Q1, a 4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl moiety was introduced to a porphyrin unit through an ethynylene bridge. In contrast, these two units are directly linked to each other in the molecule of Q2. Compared with Q1, Q2 has a more twisted non-planar conformation, which results in better solubility and larger amount of adsorption on the TiO2 films with suppressed dye aggregation. Thus, the DSSC device based on Q2 has been demonstrated to achieve a higher power conversion efficiency of 5.51%, compared with that of 2.22% for Q1. These results indicate that the extension of the absorption band to a longer wavelength region by the introduction of an additional ethynylene bridge may result in worse solubility, lower adsorption amount and more severe aggregation, and thus may decrease the cell efficiency. For the design of efficient DSSC sensitizers, these contradictory effects must be fully considered and well balanced.
