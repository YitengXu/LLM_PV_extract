    , Accepted 5th September 2019First published on 5th September 2019AbstractFullerene derivatives (C60 and C70) have been widely used in excitonic solar cells due to their exceptional electron accepting properties and low reorganization energies. In recent years, a wide variety of fullerene-based n-type materials have been developed, showing tremendous potential in the field of organic photovoltaics. However, only a few studies have been performed on heteroatom bearing methanofullerenes and their opto-electronic properties for use as n-type organic semiconductor materials. In the present study, we report the synthesis of two mono-substituted methanofullerene derivatives, i.e., C60-Th (Product 1) and C60-TPA (Product 2), with a heteroatom (S and N, respectively) in the exohedral chain attached via an ethylene linker to the cyclopropane ring, and a comprehensive study of their photophysical and electrochemical properties. The methanofullerene derivatives have been synthesized using an amine-assisted cycloaddition (AACA) reaction method. The structures of the synthesized products were established via different spectroscopic techniques. Reasonable quenching efficiencies were observed with respect to the fluorescence emission in mixtures with the donor polymer P3HT using both methanofullerenes. The electron transport properties were evaluated through fabricating electron-only devices, and 10 and 6 times higher mobilities were found compared to PC61BM for Products 1 and 2, respectively. Finally, the charge transfer properties were evaluated in mixtures with P3HT via transient absorption spectroscopy to study the ultrafast charge separation and formation of long-lived charge-separated states. The study suggests that both the products show excellent electron transport properties and the formation of longer-lived charge-separated states in mixtures with the donor polymer for use as n-type materials for organic solar cells.
1. Introduction
The development of new organic functional materials has drawn considerable attention from researchers in the area of organic photovoltaics (OPV) in order to harvest maximum solar energy and to accomplish cheaper sources of energy.1 Fullerene chemistry has evolved tremendously since large scale production was reported in 1990,2 with the introduction of different types of reactions and the synthesis of a medley of fullerene derivatives with a variety of functional groups attached exohedrally.3 Of all the reactions, cycloaddition reactions are the most prevalently used for the synthesis of methanofullerene derivatives for different applications, including organic solar cells.4 Modified fullerenes maintain the anomalous properties of pristine fullerenes, like low reorganization energies and high electron affinities.5–11 For example, the attachment of suitable organic moieties to fullerenes results in tuning of energy levels, better molecular interactions as well as increased solubility. The introduction of electron donating groups as exohedral addends to methanofullerenes results in improved solubilities as well as increases in the open circuit voltages of solar cell devices.12 These advantages enable modified fullerenes to be used as n-type materials in organic electronics.13–15 For the synthesis of methanofullerene derivatives, cyclopropanation via the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of diazo compounds generated from different precursors has been exploited extensively. Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) are the most conventional acceptor materials synthesized via the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of diazo compounds and they have been used widely in organic photovoltaics (OPVs).16 We have recently reported an amine-assisted cycloaddition (AACA) reaction for the synthesis of a [6,6]-PC61BM monoadduct and several other methanofullerenes, catalyzed by an amine under total aerobic conditions, for applications in organic electronics.17 Although, among the myriad fullerene derivatives, several heteroatom-bearing fullerene products have been reported (Prato products, fused fullerenes, etc.) using amines and sulfur derivatives,18 only a few methanofullerene derivatives have been reported with a heteroatom in the exohedral addend.19 Recently thiophene-containing methanofullerenes were developed and used as the electron transport layers in perovskite solar cells as an organic Lewis base to passivate the uncoordinated lead ions.20,21 There is still a lack of reports on heteroatom-containing methanofullerenes involving a comprehensive study of their opto-electronic and charge transfer properties. More research is required on the preparation of methanofullerenes, especially using low-cost amines and thiophene derivatives for cost-effective bulk scale synthesis for a large area of applications.
In this context, in the current work, we have synthesized two new methanofullerene derivatives having a heteroatom in the exohedral addend. In Product 1 (C60-Th), a thiophene-ring end unit is attached to the fullerene exohedrally via the cyclopropane ring and an ethylene linker. Product 2 (C60-TPA) contains a triphenylamine end group attached to the fullerene exohedrally in the same manner as in Product 1 (Fig. 1). Thiophene and triphenylamine both are electron-rich groups and act as energy absorbing centers.22 Both molecules have been synthesized via an AACA process from their diazo intermediates. The synthesized molecules have been characterized via UV-vis, FTIR, and NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for the establishment of their structures. The HOMO–LUMO energy levels of the products have been calculated via cyclic voltammetry. The thermal stabilities were confirmed via thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The electron mobilities of the products was also evaluated through making electron-only devices. Photoluminescence and time-resolved fluorescence studies were performed to study the efficient charge transfer interactions between methanofullerene and the donor P3HT polymer. Finally, to further study the efficient charge transfer and generation of charge separated states, we performed transient absorption spectroscopy in mixtures with P3HT. Both materials show excellent acceptor properties with ultrafast charge separation.

2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials and characterization
Thiophene-3-carboxaldehyde, 4-(diphenylamino)benzaldehyde, p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide, triethylamine and poly(3-hexyl)thiophene were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. [60]-Fullerene was purchased from Alfa Aesar. All solvents were used after drying and were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was done using PerkinElmer FTIR Spectrum 2 apparatus. Samples were ground with anhydrous KBr and pellets were prepared to record the spectrum from 4000 to 500 cm−1. A background spectrum in air was obtained before samples were analyzed. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy measurements were performed with a Shimadzu UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-1800) using 25 μM solutions and spin coated films. The products were also characterized using 1H NMR spectroscopy with a Jeol 400 MHz spectrometer in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. We were not able to record 13C NMR data due to the low concentrations of products. MALDI-TOF-TOF mass spectrometry (AB SCIEX) was used to determine the molecular weights of the products, using an α-cyano 4-hydroxy cinnamic acid matrix. A three-electrode standard configuration was used for cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements, using platinum wire as the counter electrode, Ag wire as the reference electrode and a Pt disc as the working electrode. 0.1 M TBAPF6 (tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate) was used as the supporting electrolyte and a 1 mM solution of methanofullerene in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) was used to perform the experiments. Current vs. voltage curves were measured using an Autolab potentiostat. Fluorescence measurements were performed with a Varian (CARY eclipse) fluorescence spectrophotometer using 25 μM solutions and also films. A solid sample holder assembly was used to record the fluorescence data from films. A Horiba Jobin Yvon (Fluorohub) spectrometer was used to record time resolved fluorescence data from 25 μM toluene solutions, but we were not able to measure this data from films due to instrument limitations. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy was performed using an optical pulse from a Ti:sapphire laser amplifier (35 fs, 4 mJ per pulse, 1 kHz, 800 nm). A beam splitter was used to split the pulse into two beams. An optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS, Light Conversion) was employed with the high intensity beam (pump) to vary the wavelength from 190 nm to 2600 nm. A weak intensity beam (probe) was propagated through a CaF2 crystal to generate a white light continuum (WLC). A computer-controlled delay stage was used to optically delay the probe beam with respect to the pump beam. In the current study, we used a 450 nm wavelength pump beam at normal incidence and changes in absorption were detected by using a gated CMOS detector. Time-resolved studies were performed using a HELIOS (Ultrafast systems) spectrometer and lifetimes were estimated via global fitting.
2.2. General method for the synthesis of chalcone 1a and chalcone 2a17a
Acetophenone (2 mM) and thiophene-3-carboxaldehyde for 1a (2 mM) or 4-(diphenyl)amino benzaldehyde for 2a (2 mM) were dissolved in 20 mL of ethanol. After dissolution, 40% NaOH solution (10 mL) was added under continuous stirring at room temperature and the reaction progress was monitored via TLC. Finally, the reaction mixture was precipitated using dilute HCl (20%). The crude product was filtered and washed many times with water and purified via column chromatography using ethyl acetate:n-hexane (70:30) as the eluent.

2.3. General method of the synthesis of hydrazone (1b) and hydrazone (2b) from chalcones (1a and 2a)17a
The tosyl hydrazones were prepared via refluxing a solution of chalcone 1a or chalcone 2a (0.5 mM) and p-toluene sulfonyl hydrazide (1.1 equivalent) in methanol (50 mL) under continuous stirring for ∼6 h. Crystals of hydrazone precipitated out of solution upon cooling and they were dried after washing with cold methanol.
Yields: ∼75%. 1b: FTIR (cm−1, ν): 3203, 3021, 1616, 1310, 1194, 1044, 751; 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) δ (ppm): 2.36 (3H), 6.22 (1H), 6.88 (1H), 7.01 (2H), 7.06 (1H), 7.19 (1H), 7.27 (3H), 7.40 (2H), 7.45 (2H), 7.7 (2H). 2b: FTIR (cm−1, ν): 3192, 3059, 2921, 1677, 1585, 1489, 1268, 1150, 1010, 759; 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) δ (ppm): 2.3 (3H), 6.7 (1H), 6.9 (2H), 6.9–7.11 (10H), 7.25–7.30 (9 H), 7.6 (2H), 7.7 (2H).
2.4. General method for the synthesis of the methanofullerenes C60-Th (1) and C60-TPA (2)17a
Hydrazone, 1b or 2b, (0.25 mM) was dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL) and cooled to 0 °C. A catalytic amount of triethyl amine (0.9 mL) was added and stirred for three hours at this temperature. A solution of C60 (0.5 equivalents) in o-dichlorobenzene (20 mL) was added and the temperature was raised to 85–90 °C. Stirring was continued for 8 hours, followed by precipitation with methanol. The precipitate was collected via centrifugation. The crude product was loaded on a silica gel column (200 mm ×18 mm) for purification using a toluene/hexane (70:30) mixture as the eluent. Unreacted fullerene was isolated as the first fraction, followed by a purple colored monoadduct, i.e., [5,6]-fulleroid. Refluxing the [5,6]-isomers in o-dichlorobenzene for 5 hours converts them totally to wine-colored [6,6]-methanofullerene via thermal isomerisation.

2.5. Fabrication of electron-only devices17c

2.5.1. Preparation of the zinc oxide precursor solution. 
A solution of zinc oxide (ZnO) was prepared via dissolving 1 g (4.5 mM) of zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3CO2)2·2H2O) in 10 mL of methoxyethanol with 0.254 mL of monoethanolamine (MEA) as the stabilizing agent at room temperature. The mixed solution was then stirred at 60 °C for about 2 hours until a clear and homogenous solution was obtained.


2.5.2. Current–voltage characteristics. 
Electron-only devices with an ITO/ZnO/Product 1 or 2/Al architecture were fabricated on clean ITO-coated glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 20 Ohm sq−1 under ambient conditions. The substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, distilled water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol and dried in a vacuum oven. The ZnO precursor solution was spin-coated onto the substrates at 3000 rpm, followed by annealing at 250 °C for 30 minutes. Methanofullerene solution (20, 30 and 40 mg mL−1) in chlorobenzene was prepared and spin-coated at 1000 rpm on top of the electron transport layer, followed by annealing at 120 °C for 15 min. Finally, the cathode material, i.e., a 100 nm Al layer, was deposited on top of the active layer under high vacuum to complete the device structure. The film thickness was measured using a calibrated ellipsometer (J A Woolam; model: Vase). The J–V characteristics were recorded using a calibrated computer-controlled Keithley 236 source meter under dark conditions.

3. Results and discussion
The most accepted approach for the synthesis of methanofullerenes is via a diazoalkane intermediate from a tosyl hydrazone precursor in pyridine in the presence of sodium methoxide under an inert atmosphere.23,24 This process is very hazardous and has a high impact on the environment due to disposal during the material synthesis. Amine-assisted cycloaddition reactions have been found to be less hazardous and more energy efficient over other methods for methanofullerene synthesis, as they are performed under aerobic conditions without using pyridine and sodium methoxide.25 The AACA method makes the bulk synthesis of methanofullerene feasible at very cheap prices, which is required for the commercialization of OPVs. In the present work, we have synthesized two different methanofullerene derivatives bearing heteroatoms (Fig. 1) via our AACA method.
For the synthesis of the methanofullerenes, chalcones were prepared in the first step via the Claisen–Schmidt condensation of acetophenone with the respective ketones (Scheme 1). The reactions of thiophene-3-carboxaldehyde and 4-(diphenyl)amino benzaldehyde with acetophenone form the enones 1a and 2a, respectively, where an α,β double bond is present in the phenyl ketones. Hydrazones (1b and 2b) were prepared from their respective chalcones in methanol using p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide. After tosylation, the diazo intermediate was generated at 0 °C in the presence of a tertiary amine as a catalyst under aerobic conditions. Fullerene (C60) solution in o-DCB was added in situ and the reaction was carried out for 8 h at 90 °C, as shown in Scheme 1(A and B), and the progress of the reaction was monitored via thin layer chromatography (TLC). The reaction mixture was precipitated using methanol and subjected to column chromatography for purification. The kinetically favorable product, the [5,6]-open fulleroid, is converted into the thermodynamically stable [6,6]-methanofullerene via reflux in o-DCB for 5 h.

The structures of Products 1 and 2 have been analyzed via different spectroscopic techniques. The FTIR spectrum of Product 1, a fullerene, clearly shows aromatic C–H stretching at 3096 cm−1 and CC bond stretching at 1621 cm−1, while the FTIR spectrum of Product 2 shows aromatic C–H stretching at 3057 and 3024 cm−1 and CC bond stretching at 1627 cm−1. 1H NMR spectroscopy further confirms the purity and formation of [6,6]-methanofullerenes. The 1H NMR spectrum of Product 1 shows the appearance of ethylene protons at 6.75 and 6.86 ppm and other aromatic protons appear between 6.96 and 7.8 ppm. Product 2 shows chemical shifts at 6.2 and 6.8 ppm for the ethylene protons with other aromatic protons between 7.0 and 7.7 ppm (19H) being indicative of the formation of the product.26 Mass analysis further confirmed the formation of the monoadduct for both products (see the ESI†).
3.1. Steady-state absorption spectroscopy
Absorption spectroscopy is a widely used technique to confirm the conversion of a [5,6]-fulleroid into a [6,6]-methanofullerene. The peak at ∼697 nm confirms the formation of the [6,6]-adduct, as it is not present in the [5,6]-adduct.23Fig. 2A and Fig. S15 (ESI†) show comparisons of the absorption spectra of Products 1 and 2 in chloroform solution (25 μM) in the visible range. Both products show similar absorption to PC61BM, a widely used acceptor material in organic solar cells. The absorption spectra show the clear appearance of peaks at 430 and 697 nm for Product 1 and at 433 and 702 nm for the fullerene adduct 2, confirming [6,6]-addition to the fullerene core and the formation of methanofullerenes. The optical band gaps have been calculated from the absorption onsets, and the values are estimated to be 1.77 and 1.76 eV for Products 1 and 2, respectively. Absorption spectra were also recorded from thin films (spin-coated 25 μM chloroform solution at 1000 rpm), showing broad absorption over the whole visible region and extended absorption up to 800 nm due to aggregate formation in the solid state. Both products show higher absorption than the reference PC61BM in film-form.

3.2. Thermal properties
Thermogravimetric analysis was performed to study the thermal stabilities of the materials for the optimization of the annealing temperature of films during device fabrication. The TGA thermograms are shown in Fig. 3. Both methanofullerene derivatives show no weight loss up to 150 °C and only 10% weight loss up to 200 °C, as observed in earlier cases.17a Both materials show ∼50% weight loss up to 900 °C. For the optimization of the annealing temperature of films, thermal stability information is a prerequisite, and here we find that films of both products can be annealed at 120 °C.

3.3. Electrochemical analysis
Electrochemical studies of the products were conducted via cyclic voltammetry (CV) to determine the redox potentials and HOMO–LUMO levels of the synthesized methanofullerene derivatives. Fig. 4 shows cyclic voltammograms of the methanofullerene derivatives and data are summarized in Table 1. Both products show well-defined quasi-reversible reduction potentials, indicating their n-type semiconductor natures.17 Product 1 showed three clear reduction peaks at −1.29, −1.66 and −2.10 V, whereas in Product 2, two reversible reductions at −1.31 and −1.68 V were observed (Fig. 4a and b) for fullerene reduction. Product 2 also showed the one electron oxidation of the triphenylamino group at ∼0.46 V. HOMO–LUMO energy levels were calculated using the empirical formula EHOMO/LUMO = −(Eonset(red/ox) + 4.8 eV). The LUMO energy levels were estimated to be −3.7 and −3.68 eV, respectively, for Products 1 and 2 using the onset reduction potential, which are lower than that of PC61BM.27 From the oxidation onset potential, the HOMO energy levels were calculated to be 5.59 eV and 5.13 eV for Product 1 and Product 2, respectively. Using the HOMO–LUMO energy levels, the electrochemical band gaps were calculated to be 1.89 eV and 1.45 eV for Products 1 and 2, respectively. These values are within the error range of optical band gaps mentioned earlier.28 Although the LUMO energy levels are the same for both products, the HOMO is raised in Product 2 due to the presence of the electron-rich triphenylamine group causing a lower oxidation potential and thus lowering the band gap of Product 2.

3.4. Electron transport studies
To ascertain the potential of the new methanofullerenes for application in organic solar cells, we fabricated electron-only devices of variable thickness to investigate the charge carrier mobilities. Solutions of the methanofullerene products (1 and 2) were prepared in chlorobenzene with varying concentrations from 20–40 mg mL−1, followed by spin-coating on top of ZnO-coated ITO substrates under inert conditions. A schematic diagram of the devices and energy level diagrams are shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  A schematic diagram of the fabricated electron-only devices with an energy level diagram of the corresponding layers. 
The electron mobilities of the materials were estimated using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model. At applied voltages above 0.1 V, current–voltage curves demonstrate a power law dependence, i.e., J ∝ Vm, where m takes different values over different voltage regimes.29 After the ohmic region, a second region, i.e., a trap-controlled space charge limited conduction (SCLC) region, has been observed at a gradient value of 2 at a single energy level inside the band gap; this mechanism can be represented via the following Mott–Gurney eqn (1):30 (1)where JSCLC stands for the space charge limited current density, μ0 is the mobility of the organic semiconductor, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the permittivity of the medium, L is the thickness of the organic semiconductor layer, V is the applied potential, and VBi is the built-in potential. Generally, the charge carrier mobilities in organic materials are low due to structural disorder in the films. I–V data was recorded under dark conditions. Current density–voltage curves at different concentrations are shown in Fig. S16 and S17 (ESI†). At a low applied voltage, the dependence of J on V is linear and the behavior is ohmic (slope 1). Upon increasing the voltage, charge carriers are injected and the current becomes space charge limited with m = 2 (slope 2). Electron mobility values have been calculated through fitting the experimental J–V data to eqn (1). The electron mobilities for the new methanofullerenes with variable thicknesses are summarized in Table 2. The film thickness is an important parameter for the determination of charge carrier mobility. Decreased layer thickness limits the injection of charge carriers into the bulk material, leading to a reduced charge carrier collection rate and resulting in decreased charge carrier mobility. The highest mobilities for the synthesized acceptors were achieved with 200 nm thickness, and the values are 1.02 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for Products 1 and 2, respectively, which are 10 and 6 times higher, respectively, than that of PC61BM (0.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).17c

3.5. Fluorescence spectroscopy studies
The fluorescence spectra of mixtures of Product 1 or 2 with a polymer (P3HT) (1:1 weight ratio) have been obtained to analyze the quenching efficiency using eqn (2): ϕq = (Io − I)/Io(2)where Io is the PL intensity of pure P3HT at the same concentration and I is the PL intensity of the P3HT:Product mixture. P3HT shows strong fluorescence at ∼580 nm upon excitation at 450 nm (Fig. 6A). In a mixture of P3HT:Product 1, the fluorescence peak of P3HT is quenched by 60%, while in a P3HT:Product 2 mixture, 90% quenching was observed (Fig. 6A). The decreases in the intensities of the emission bands in P3HT:Product 1 or 2 mixtures compared to neat P3HT show the efficient intermolecular charge transfer and dissociation of photogenerated excitons in P3HT upon excitation (Fig. 6). We also recorded the fluorescence spectra of neat P3HT and P3HT:Product 1 or 2 blend films (1:1 weight ratio) under 450 nm excitation (Fig. 6B). The films showed red shifted emission between 600–850 nm compared to the corresponding solutions. We observed quenching efficiencies of ∼50–65% for Products 1 and 2, however, 50 wt% PC61BM/P3HT blend films have shown fluorescence quenching efficiencies of above 95% following a charge transfer process.31 Further work is underway to optimize the P3HT/Product 1 or 2 weight ratio and annealing temperature to obtain maximum quenching efficiencies.
 Fig. 6  Fluorescence emission spectra of P3HT alone and in mixtures with Product 1 (C60-Th) and Product 2 (C60-TPA) (1:1 weight ratio) in (A) chloroform solution and (B) in films under 450 nm excitation. 
Time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) was performed to estimate the lifetimes of the singlet excited state of P3HT alone and in mixtures with Products 1 and 2 (1:1 weight ratio) (Fig. S18, ESI†). As reported earlier by us, the studies were performed in solution to avoid improper estimations of the lifetimes of excited states due to traps in the films.17a The singlet excited state relaxation of P3HT at 584 nm showed a lifetime of ∼0.85 ns.17a Mixtures with Product 1 and Product 2 showed further reduced decay times, to 0.78 ns and 0.72 ns, due to the non-radiative charge transfer relaxation of excited P3HT molecules. The observed decay times are slightly higher than what we have observed with other methanofullerenes with electron withdrawing groups as exohedral addends.17a
We further calculated the electron transfer rate constants for charge separation (kET(CS)) using the lifetimes estimated via TCSPC using eqn (3). (3)
Products 1 and 2 showed kET(CS) values of 1 × 108 and 2.1 × 108 s−1, respectively, in mixtures with P3HT, which are the same order of magnitude as a P3HT:PCBM mixture in o-DCB (∼4.6 × 108 s−1).32 At this point we need to conduct a deeper study to understand the lower quenching efficiencies and lower rates of electron transfer in these heteroatom-bearing methanofullerenes compared to our previously reported methanofullerenes in 1:1 weight ratio mixtures with the donor polymer.17c Therefore, we performed transient absorption spectroscopy on neat P3HT and its mixtures with both products to study the excited state dynamics.
3.6. Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) studies
Transient absorption spectroscopy studies were performed on neat P3HT, Products 1 and 2, and also on mixtures of product 1 or 2 with P3HT in chloroform (1:1 weight ratio). Transient absorption spectra give direct information about the generation of excited states and they also specify the spectral regions involved in further electron transport processes. The TA spectra were recorded both in the visible and NIR region upon excitation (pump) at 480 nm. For neat P3HT, ground state absorption (GSA) bleaching was observed between 520 and 620 nm, and stimulated emission appeared at >620 nm after ∼500 fs (Fig. S19, ESI†). After a 1 ps delay, along with GSA, transient absorption appeared at ∼740 nm for absorption through photogenerated charges in P3HT. Neat Product 1 showed transient absorption at ∼714, 741 and 767 nm, appearing after a delay time of 5 ps, in the visible region (Fig. S20, ESI†), while transient absorption at ∼885 nm and 1030 nm appeared after delay times of 2 and 5 ps, respectively, in the NIR region (Fig. S21, ESI†). The transient absorption bands in the visible region are due to singlet–singlet transitions, and absorption at 885 nm is due to the excited singlet state absorption of Product 1. Absorption of photogenerated charges appears at ∼1030 nm.33 Neat Product 2 shows two transient absorption bands at ∼712 nm and ∼756 nm from singlet–singlet transitions after a delay time of 5 ps (Fig. S22, ESI†). Similar to Product 1, Product 2 also shows transient absorption at 885 and 1030 nm from excited singlet state and photogenerated charge absorption, respectively (Fig. S23, ESI†). An interesting observation from the TA spectra of Product 1 is the appearance of an extra transient absorption at 767 nm compared to Product 2. This transient absorption is similar to what we observed in the polymer P3HT from photogenerated charges on the thiophene ring. Intramolecular charge transfer interactions between the thiophene ring and fullerene facilitated by the ethylene linker cause the formation of charged species within the molecule, showing transient absorption at ∼767 nm. This also causes the lower quenching efficiency of P3HT emission in the P3HT:Product 1 mixture. In the TA spectra of the P3HT:Product 1 mixture, strong stimulated emission appears at 600 nm, as seen in the fluorescence emission spectra, with a lifetime of 249 ps (Fig. 7). After a delay time of 1 ps, strong transient absorption appears between 700–770 nm with a maximum at 766 nm from the P3HT cation radical (P3HT+˙), with a lifetime of 1.6 ns (Fig. 7A).34 Simultaneously, within 1 ps, transient absorption appears at ∼1037 nm from fullerene anion radical (C60−˙) formation (Fig. 7B), with a lifetime of 1.5 ns.33
 Fig. 7  Transient absorption spectra from a mixture of Product 1 with P3HT in (A) the UV-visible region and (B) the NIR region upon excitation at 480 nm. The insets show the kinetics at 766 and 1037 nm for the P3HT+˙ and C60−˙ charge transfer species, respectively. 
On the other hand, the P3HT:Product 2 mixture shows strong photobleaching at 530 nm during ground state absorption and ∼580 nm during stimulated emission. Absorption from the P3HT+˙ cation radical was observed at 767 nm with a lifetime of 1.2 ns, as shown in Fig. 8A, and the C60−˙ anion radical appeared at 1037 nm with a lifetime of 1.5 ns (Fig. 8B). In both cases, the generation of charge-separated states, i.e. P3HT+˙ and C60−˙, were observed within a short delay time of ∼2 ps. Although the quenching efficiency was ≤90% in these fullerene derivatives upon mixing with P3HT, ultra-fast charge transfer with the formation of long-lived charge-separated states has been observed as required for application in OPV devices.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized two different methanofullerene derivatives with heteroatoms in the exohedral chains via a cost-effective AACA process, establishing the versatile application of this process for the generation of diazoalkane intermediates bearing different types of groups. The products have been synthesized in good yields and with high purities. Electrochemical data shows the tuning of the LUMO as well as the HOMO levels and, therefore, the band gaps due to the presence of electron donating groups. Both products show electron transfer rate constants with the same order of magnitude as P3HT:PC61BM mixtures and the generation of charge-separated states with nanosecond lifetimes, thus confirming efficient charge separation upon mixing with P3HT. Both products show higher electron mobilities than PC61BM, making them potential candidates for use as n-type materials in organic electronic devices. Also, this work shows the tuning of HOMO levels in methanofullerenes via easy substitution with electron donating groups in the exohedral chain. The raised HOMO levels in the acceptors will make them suitable to be used with low band gap polymers with lower HOMO energy levels.
