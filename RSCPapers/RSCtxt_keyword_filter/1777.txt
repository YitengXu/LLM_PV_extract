Yet, it remains unclear how bromine incorporation modifies the properties of the perovskite solar cells. Here we use methylammonium lead iodide–bromide [MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0–0.11)] as a model system to study the question. Through elemental analysis we found that bromine exhibits an increased concentration towards the interface between perovskite and TiO2, and that such interface bromine accumulation is more pronounced when a HI acid additive is used to produce the perovskite films. Opto-electrical characterization results further suggest that the carrier lifetime in the perovskite and the charge extraction at the perovskite/TiO2 interface are improved in the mixed halide perovskite samples. Accordingly, the optimal thickness of the perovskite active layer is increased from 330 nm for MAPbI3 to 510 nm for MAPb(I0.89Br0.11)3, resulting in an average efficiency increase of 1.6%. The study highlights the role of bromine in passivating defect states at grain boundaries and interfaces in mixed halide perovskite solar cells and demonstrates the use of solvent additives in tuning the electronic properties of the mixed halide perovskite materials.
Introduction
Organometal halide perovskite solar cells have seen rapid progress since they were first demonstrated in a dye-sensitized solar cell configuration in 2009.1–6 The material has the generic structure ABX3, where A represents a monovalent cation, e.g., methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA), cesium (Cs) or any mixture thereof, B represents a divalent metal ion and X represents a halide ion, e.g., chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I) or any mixture thereof. Among the various perovskite photovoltaic materials studied until now, the mixed I–Br perovskite shows particularly attractive properties and fast-improving power conversion efficiency (PCE).3,4,6 The tunable optical bandgap by varying the bromine/iodine concentration in the perovskite7–9 makes the material suitable for high efficiency tandem cells.10–14 For instance, it has been predicted that a tandem structure incorporating crystalline silicon into the bottom cell and a 1.70–1.76 eV bandgap perovskite into the top cell can yield a PCE of >30%.15 Single junction mixed I–Br perovskite solar cells have also shown highly promising performance, with the highest efficiency already reaching 21.1%.6 Furthermore, it has been shown that the mixed I–Br perovskites possess enhanced moisture resistance6,7 and excellent thermal stability,6,9 both are crucial for realizing the long-term stability of solar cells.
Despite the rapid increase in the cell efficiency of the mixed I–Br perovskites, there remain unsolved fundamental questions regarding the impact of bromine inclusion on the electronic processes in the perovskites. Besides replacing iodine atoms in the PbI6− framework and thus changing the bandgap of the perovskite,7–9 bromine atoms may also move to the grain boundaries and interfaces and thus modify the defect properties of the perovskite films. Previous studies have suggested that the presence of chlorine atoms at the grain boundaries16 and the interface between perovskite and its neighboring carrier transport layer17–19 can reduce carrier recombination and enhance carrier collection. A very recent theoretical study proposed that bromine might play a similar role to chlorine.17 Whether this is true is yet to be experimentally verified.
In this work, we study the role of bromine using methylammonium lead mixed I–Br perovskite [MAPb(I1−xBrx)3] as a model system. We applied a HI acid-assisted one-step spin-coating method to fabricate MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0–0.11) perovskite films and to incorporate the films in a planar FTO/compact TiO2 (c-TiO2)/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag solar cell configuration. Through X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, we observed an increased concentration of bromine towards the perovskite/TiO2 interface, and found that such interfacial bromine accumulation is more pronounced in the films prepared using the HI additive. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay measurements further suggest that the bromine inclusion improves the carrier lifetime. Solar cells prepared from MAPb(I0.89Br0.11)3 exhibit improved charge extraction as compared to those based on pure methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI3). Accordingly, the optimal thickness of the active layer is increased from 330 nm for MAPbI3 to 510 nm for MAPb(I0.89Br0.11)3, resulting in an average efficiency increase of 1.6%.
Results and discussion
The mixed I–Br perovskite films were prepared from (PbI2 + MAI)1−y(PbBr2 + MABr)y DMF solution (1.4 M; y = 0, 0.1 and 0.2 and represents the nominal concentration in the original precursor) with 7 vol% HI acid additive. The film thicknesses were around 500 nm unless otherwise indicated. The absorption spectra of the prepared films were taken with an ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrometer equipped with an integral sphere and are shown in Fig. 1(a). It can be seen that the absorption edge blue-shifts with the increase of the bromine content, suggesting a gradually widened bandgap.7,20 Interestingly, the perovskite films prepared with and without the HI additive exhibit different absorption spectra. Taking (PbI2 + MAI)0.8(PbBr2 + MABr)0.2 as an example [Fig. 1(a)], the bandgap of the “HI aided” perovskite film is reduced as compared with that of the control sample prepared without the HI additive. The result indicates a small amount of bromine loss in the HI assisted film deposition process. The loss process may occur through the following reaction: Br− + HI → I− + HBr↑(1)

In order to obtain the actual bromine concentration in the MAPbI(1−xBrx)3 perovskite films, i.e., to determine the exact x value, we calculated x based on the Eg (extracted from the Tauc plots) and x correlation established by Fedeli et al.20 The results are summarized in Table 1.

After determining the bromine concentration, we now turn to examine the film morphology and crystallinity. As shown in Fig. 1(c)–(e), all mixed halide perovskite films prepared with the HI acid additive exhibit full film coverage and closely packed grains. The surface roughness of the grains shows some variation among different samples, but the films are in general smooth [Fig. S1 and Table S1†]. The phase purity and crystallinity of the MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 films were confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns shown in Fig. 1(b). The 14° and 28° diffraction peaks exhibit sharp profiles, and the corresponding peak intensities appear to be similar in all three samples, suggesting the same degree of crystallinity in the three perovskite films. Based on the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD peaks, the bulk grain sizes of the perovskite films are estimated to be in the range of 195 nm to 220 nm. The detailed calculation21 is described in the ESI (Table S2†). We also observe that the two diffraction peaks shift towards higher degrees upon the increase of bromine content, in agreement with the contraction of the crystal lattice.7
In order to understand the role of bromine in the electronic properties of the perovskites, we performed time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy on MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0 and 0.11) perovskite films prepared on glass and c-TiO2/FTO substrates(Fig. 2). All the films are fabricated by the HI-aided process. We prepared perovskite films on glass so as to avoid the quenching of carriers and thus the carriers' life time can be observed. As shown in Fig. 2(a), on glass the mixed I–Br perovskite [MAPb(I0.89Br0.11)3] film shows a slower PL decay as compared to the pure iodide perovskite (MAPbI3) film, suggesting a longer carrier lifetime and thus reduced charge recombination in the former. Considering that the MAPb(I0.89Br0.11)3 and MAPbI3 films have very similar crystallinity and grain size [Fig. 1(b) and Table S2†], the different TRPL responses are likely due to the grain boundary effect – bromine may have a similar function to chlorine in modifying the bandgap and reducing the phonon coupling at the grain boundaries.16 Note that bulk defects, such as Schottky and Frenkel defects, do not act as nonradiative recombination centers.22 So their influence on PL is not discussed here.
 Fig. 2  The TRPL decay of HI-aided MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0 and 0.11) perovskite films prepared on glass (a) or TiO2/FTO glass (b). 
The perovskite film was prepared on a FTO substrate coated with an n-type TiO2 compact layer to ensure selective collection of electrons. In contrast to the perovskite films on glass, the perovskite films in contact with the c-TiO2/FTO substrate exhibit much faster PL decay, with the mixed I–Br perovskite showing the shortest decay time [Fig. 2(b)]. This clearly suggests that the electron extraction is more efficient at the mixed I–Br perovskite/TiO2 interface. The hole extraction is also checked by TRPL by incorporating the MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0 and 0.11) films between glass and spiro-MeOTAD (Fig. S2†). Here spiro-MeOTAD acts as the hole quenching layer. The spectra show almost the same decay dynamics (Fig. S2†), indicating similar hole extraction efficiency of the two samples. The result also suggests that the small variation in the surface roughness of the perovskite films does not affect the hole extraction across the perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD interface.
To understand the enhanced electron extraction at the mixed I–Br perovskite/TiO2 interface, we measured the depth composition profile of the MAPb(I0.89Br0.11)3 perovskite films by XPS. The films were deposited on the c-TiO2/FTO substrate following the same process as solar cell fabrication. During the measurement, Ar+ ions were used to etch the sample layer by layer until the TiO2 layer was etched through, and before each etching step the surface composition information was recorded. Before the first etching step is performed the surface of the film gives intense signals of carbon and oxygen due to surface contamination [Fig. 3(a)]. With the prolonged etching time the contents of the detected elements start to stabilize [Fig. 3(a)]. When the etching time reaches 480 s, the concentrations of lead, iodide, carbon and nitrogen exhibit a sharp decrease and the concentrations of titanium and oxygen increase [Fig. 3(a)], indicating that the etching has reached the perovskite/TiO2 interface. Interestingly, we found that the concentration of bromine increases in the vicinity of the perovskite/TiO2 interface [Fig. 3(a)]. In order to find out whether the HI additive also plays a role in the bromine segregation at the interface, we further checked the depth composition profile of MAPb(I0.89Br0.11)3 perovskite films prepared without the HI additive23 [Fig. 3(c)]. In this case, the content of bromine still increases towards the interface (t = 480 s), suggesting that the bromine-rich phase is an intrinsic property of the mixed halide perovskite/TiO2 interface. The reason for the formation of such a bromine-rich phase is not yet clear. We note that recent theoretical studies report controversial predictions on whether light halogen atoms, such as chlorine or bromine, would favorably interact with the TiO2 surface,17,19 and that the deviation seems to be related to the orientation of the perovskite and TiO2 surfaces. Our result suggests that the interface interaction is better described by the perovskite (110)/TiO2 anatase (101) model.19
 Fig. 3  The depth composition profile of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0.11) films prepared with and without the HI additive on c-TiO2/FTO substrates: (a) variation of the C, O, N, I, Pb, Br, Ti, and Sn atomic percentage with the etching time in the sample prepared with the HI additive; (b) variation of atomic ratios of Br to Pb and I to Pb with etching time in the sample prepared with the HI additive; (c) variation of the C, O, N, I, Pb, Br, Ti, and Sn atomic percentage with the etching time in the sample prepared without the HI additive (anti-solvent is used during film deposition to ensure the smoothness of the film); (d) variation of atomic ratios of Br to Pb and I to Pb with etching time in the sample prepared without the HI additive. As the content of Pb, I and Br is under the detection limit after the etching time of 480 s, the atomic ratios are not given in the figure. 
By tracing the variation of the ratios of bromine to lead (Br/Pb) and iodine to lead (I/Pb) through the etching process [Fig. 3(b) and (d)], we found that the HI-aided perovskite film exhibits much stronger bromine accumulation at the interface. This is likely associated with the release process of HBr described in eqn (1). Note that in the precursor solution with the HI additive, a higher concentration of bromide compounds is used to compensate the release of HBr. This naturally results in a higher initial bromine concentration at the TiO2/perovskite interface. During the HBr release process, less bromine ions will be removed from the interface as compared to the bulk due to the favorable interaction of bromine with the TiO2 surface. Therefore, the interface accumulation of bromine is more pronounced in the HI-aided cases. We further incorporate the triiodide and mixed halide perovskite films into a solar cell structure (FTO/c-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Ag) to examine whether the improved electronic properties of the mixed halide perovskite have led to better photovoltaic (PV) performance. We first optimized the device performance by tuning the film thickness. A sample comparison between MAPbI3 and MAPb(I0.89Br0.11)3 is shown in Fig. 4(a) and Table S3.† It can be seen that the optimized thickness for MAPb(I0.89Br0.11)3 based solar cells is about 510 nm, much larger than the optimized thickness of 330 nm for MAPbI3 (note that other film preparation methods may lead to larger grain sizes and consequently a larger optimal thickness for MAPbI3 (ref. 24)). We then fixed the perovskite film thickness at around 500 nm and recorded the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells containing different bromine ratios. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the short circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) all increase with the bromine content in the x = 0–0.11 range. The J–V curves of the devices with a broader x range are also provided in Fig. 4(b) and Table S3,† suggesting that the optimal PV performance is obtained at x = 0.11. The drop in Jsc and increase in Voc at x = 0.20 are due to the enlarged bandgap. The abnormal drop in the PV performance at x = 0.29 may be related to the light induced trap formation in the mixed I–Br perovskite with x larger than about 0.25.25 In the third experiment, we conduct the transient photocurrent measurement on the MAPbI3 and MAPb(I0.89Br0.11)3 based perovskites solar cells. The devices were biased under short-circuit conditions, and the photocurrent decays were recorded after the excitation light was turned off. As shown in Fig. 5, the photocurrent decays much faster in the MAPb(I0.89Br0.11)3 perovskite solar cell than in the MAPbI3 cell, indicating more efficient carrier extraction in the former.

Taking together, the above results confirm that the bromine inclusion enhances the PV performance via improving the charge extraction property of the perovskite films. Increasing the thickness of the photoactive layer can usually increase the light absorption of a solar cell; however, it may result in less efficient charge extraction due to charge recombination and charge trapping. In the case of the mixed halide perovskite, the bromine atoms passivate the recombination centers and trap states and the grain boundaries of the perovskite films and their interface with the TiO2 layer, thus leading to a longer carrier diffusion length and enabling thicker solar cells with higher light absorption. The champion cell in this study is achieved with a 510 nm MAPb(I0.89Br0.11)3 layer, and it reaches an efficiency of 16.9% (Fig. S3†).
Conclusions
In summary, we have systematically studied the role of bromine in mixed halide perovskites using methylammonium lead mixed iodide–bromide [MAPb(I1−xBrx)3] as a model system. Through XPS depth-profile measurements, we observed an increased concentration of bromine towards the perovskite/TiO2 interface, and found that such gradient distribution is more pronounced in the films prepared using the HI additive. TRPL decay measurements suggest that the bromine inclusion improves the carrier lifetime, while the bromine accumulation at the interface enhances electron extraction. As a result, the optimal thickness of the perovskite active layer is increased from 330 nm for MAPbI3 to 510 nm for MAPb(I0.89Br0.11)3, leading to an average efficiency increase of 1.6%. Our study highlights the role of bromine in passivating defect states at grain boundaries and interfaces in mixed halide perovskite solar cells and demonstrates the use of solvent additives in tuning the electronic properties of the mixed halide perovskite materials.
Experimental section
Solar cell fabrication
FTO (DHS-FTO22-15N, HeptaChroma) substrates were sequentially cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and 2-propanol for 30 min each, followed by oxygen plasma treatment for 1.5 min. A compact TiO2 hole-block layer was deposited on cleaned FTO by spin coating a mildly acidic solution of titanium butoxide (97%, Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol (consisting of 0.45 mL titanium butoxide and 35 μL 37% HCl solution in 6 mL ethanol) at 5000 rpm for 25 s, and annealed at 500 °C for 45 min in an oven. Then TiO2 coated FTO substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox and pre-heated at 100 °C for 10 min. The MAI (Dyesol), MABr (Dyesol), PbI2 (Sigma-Aldrich) and PbBr2 (Sigma-Aldrich) powders were dissolved in DMF with a total concentration of 1.4 M and a mixed ratio of (PbI2 + MAI)1−y(PbBr2 + MABr)y (y = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4). The solution was stirred for 12 h and then filtered through a PTFE filter with a pore-size of 0.22 μm. Before use, the solution was added with 7 vol% HI acid (57 wt% in water, Sigma-Aldrich) and stirred for 10 min. The resulting solution was coated onto c-TiO2/FTO substrates by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 60 s. Then the substrates were annealed for 10 min at 100 °C to form the perovskite films. The perovskites prepared for calibrating the correlation between actual bromine concentration and bandgap are prepared by spin coating the (PbI2 + MAI)1−y(PbBr2 + MABr)y (y = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4) precursor without the HI additive and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The MAPb(I0.89Br0.11)3 perovskite prepared for XPS depth composition profile measurements is prepared by the anti-solvent method, and then 50 μL chlorobenzene was dripped onto the surface at the 11th s counting from the very beginning of the spin coating process.
The spiro-MeOTAD based hole-transfer layer was prepared by mixing 67 mg spiro-MeOTAD with 30 μL lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg in 1 mL acetonitrile) and 40 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) in 1 mL chlorobenzene. The hole transport layer was deposited by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, a 100 nm silver layer was deposited by thermal evaporation with a pre-pressure of 4 × 10−5 Pa. The perovskite layer and hole transport layer were prepared in a N2-purged glovebox.
Measurement and characterization
UV-vis absorption spectra were taken on a Hitachi U-3501 ultraviolet/visible/near-infrared spectrophotometer. The film morphology was checked using an atomic force microscope (Shimadzu, SPM9700). The XRD patterns of the films were recorded with a Rigaku RU-300 diffractometer using CuKα1 radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Film thicknesses were measured using an Alpha step 500 surface profiler. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded (Keithley Instruments, 2612 Series Source Meter) under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight generated by a 94011A-ES Sol series Solar Simulator. The effective area of the cell was defined as 0.09 cm2. The Jsc values were extracted from the J–V curve under short-circuit conditions and by directly biasing the device at 0 V. The elemental composition in the films was measured by XPS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, ESCALAB 250). An argon ion gun (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EX05) is used for etching. The argon ion gun works in 3 kV/2 μA mode with an etching rate of 0.23 nm s−1 for silicon oxide. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements were performed by exciting the samples with the second harmonic (400 nm) of a mode-locked femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser with a repetition rate of 76 MHz (Mira 900, Coherent). The laser power was adjusted using neutral density filters. The excitation beam was spatially limited by an iris and focused with a 150 mm focal length lens. Time-resolved traces were recorded with a Hamamatsu streak camera working in single sweep mode or synchroscan mode, depending on lifetime. A pulse picker was inserted into the optical path to decrease the repetition rate of the laser pulses when needed. For the transient photocurrent measurement, a Newport LQD635-03C laser diode, with square-wave modulation at different frequencies, was used to illuminate the devices. The resulting photocurrent was amplified using a Femto DHPCA-100 High Speed Current Amplifier and measured with a Tektronix TDS 3014C Oscilloscope. The photocurrent decays and the related time constants were measured with a pulse repetition frequency of 51 Hz.

 	Fig. 2  The TRPL decay of HI-aided MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0 and 0.11) perovskite films prepared on glass (a) or TiO2/FTO glass (b).	 

 	Fig. 3  The depth composition profile of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0.11) films prepared with and without the HI additive on c-TiO2/FTO substrates: (a) variation of the C, O, N, I, Pb, Br, Ti, and Sn atomic percentage with the etching time in the sample prepared with the HI additive; (b) variation of atomic ratios of Br to Pb and I to Pb with etching time in the sample prepared with the HI additive; (c) variation of the C, O, N, I, Pb, Br, Ti, and Sn atomic percentage with the etching time in the sample prepared without the HI additive (anti-solvent is used during film deposition to ensure the smoothness of the film); (d) variation of atomic ratios of Br to Pb and I to Pb with etching time in the sample prepared without the HI additive. As the content of Pb, I and Br is under the detection limit after the etching time of 480 s, the atomic ratios are not given in the figure.	 

 	Fig. 4  Power conversion efficiency (PCE) as a function of the perovskite layer thickness for MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0 and 0.11) based solar cells. The J–V curves of the solar cells prepared from MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 films with x = 0, 0.03, 0.11, 0.20 and 0.29.	 

 	Fig. 5  Transient photocurrent decays under the short-circuit conditions for solar cells prepared from MAPbI3 and MAPb(I0.89Br0.11)3 perovskites.
