    , Accepted 23rd May 2021First published on 25th May 2021AbstractIn perovskite solar cells (PSCs), structure evolution that can retard the interfacial charge recombination or minimize the optical loss is of crucial importance for further efficiency development but still poses substantial challenges. Here, a novel quasi-point-contact and rear-reflection (PCRR) structure is developed for efficient PSCs by inserting a discontinuous dielectric interlayer between the perovskite film and hole transport layer (HTL). In this architecture, a large portion of perovskite/HTL contact areas, particularly the defect enriched grain boundaries, are separated by the insulating interlayer while some discrete point-contacts are reserved at the convex of some perovskite grains for hole transport. The point contact leads to significantly reduced perovskite/HTL contact areas and thus remarkably restrained interfacial charge recombination. Moreover, the polysilane with a smaller refractive index coated on the perovskite layer leads to a significant internal light reflection at the polysilane/perovskite interface. Due to the simultaneously reduced charge recombination loss and enhanced light-harvesting, the resulting PSC yields a remarkable efficiency increment from 20.96% to 22.49%. In addition, the humidity stability of the device is also remarkably improved due to the in situ encapsulation of the perovskite film by the cross-linked polysilane layer. This study paves a brand new way of interface engineering for efficient PSCs.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are currently at the forefront of emerging photovoltaic technologies due to their low cost and high efficiency.1–7 Benefiting from the evolution of the device structure (i.e. perovskite quantum dot-sensitized, mesoporous/planar structure, normal/inverted architecture, interfacial passivating structure, etc.),8–13 the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has rocketed to more than 25% in the past decade.14 Nevertheless, compared with their theoretical efficiency limit exceeding 30%,15,16 there is still plenty of room for further improvements in PCE. New cell structure designs that could minimize the charge recombination losses and maximize light harvesting are highly desired to reach the full potential of PSCs.
The recombination losses in the devices are utmostly decisive and are responsible for the gap between the practical and theoretical PCEs of PSCs because the non-radiative loss is directly associated with the photovoltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of a practical PSC.16 However, experimental Voc and FF values achieved up to now still lag far behind their calculated Shockley–Queisser limit values of 1.33 V and 0.91, respectively, for the solar cell with an absorber bandgap of 1.6 eV for instance.16–20 Latest studies revealed that the charge trap densities at the surface of a polycrystalline perovskite film are around two orders of magnitude greater than that in the film interior,21,22 whereas the p-type contact contributes a dominant portion of photoluminescence (PL) quenching and recombination loss in PSCs.21,23,24 To this end, intensive works have been recently devoted to the perovskite/HTL (hole transport layer) interface engineering to improve the efficiency of the cells by employing varied passivation materials.16,23,25–31 For instance, You et al. passivated a perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD interface by phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) and yielded a record high PCE of 23.3% in 2019.29 To enable an unhampered charge transport, the passivation layer should be semiconductive and thin enough. Therefore, feasible passivation materials are commonly limited to small organic molecules or organic salts. Considering that the non-radiative recombination mainly occurs at the interface contact, reducing the perovskite/HTL contact area would be an effective way to restrain the interfacial charge recombination in PSCs but it has not been reported yet.32–34
Besides recombination loss, there is considerable optical loss in terms of transmission and diffuse reflection, particularly when the thickness of the perovskite layer is limited to enable an efficient charge collection or to realize a low toxic Pb inclusion for the sake of environment.35–37 Numerous strategies including composition engineering,35,38,39 anti-reflection,40,41 plasmonic and photonic induced light trapping,36,42,43 down/up-conversion,44–47 and tandem devices,48–50 have demonstrated that optical modulation is a reliable approach to enhance light harvesting and to boost the PCE of solar cells. Up to now, great progress has been made to regulate the non-radiative recombination or modulate light harvesting in a PSC individually. Nevertheless, scarcely any work could address the two equally important aspects by a single modification.
Inspired by the great success of using the PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell) structure in commercial silicon solar cells (Fig. S1 in ESI†),51–53 we report herein a quasi-point contact and rear-reflection (PCRR) architecture by inserting a dielectric interlayer between the perovskite and HTL films in PSCs. The discontinuous coating of polysilane on the perovskite film leads to point contacts between perovskite and HTL, which remarkably reduces the perovskite/HTL contact areas and thereby restrains the interfacial non-radiative recombination. Moreover, the elaborate selection of a polysilane layer with –OH functional groups can also passivate surface defects on the perovskite film through Lewis acid–base interactions. All of these designs are in favor of lowering the non-radiative recombination losses at the perovskite/HTL interface. Moreover, the polysilane layer with a small refractive index also serves as an optical back-surface mirror and delivers an exceptionally high internal reflection for improved light harvesting. Consequently, the device with this PCRR structure yields an increased PCE of 22.49% under one sun illumination, with considerable enhancements in both Voc and Jsc compared with the control device. In addition, the cross-linked polysilane layer will in situ encapsulate the perovskite film and dramatically enhance the humid stability of the devices.
2. Results and discussion
Unlike silicon solar cells, an HTL is essential for high-efficiency PSCs, and meanwhile, the perovskite/HTL interfacial recombinations contribute to most of the non-radiative loss as mentioned above. Therefore, the PCRR structure is developed and set at the perovskite/HTL interface of PSCs (Fig. 1a) rather than at the metal/semiconductor interface as adopted in silicon solar cells (Fig. S1†).51–53 In general, the dielectric layer (such as Al2O3, SiOx, and SiNx) in PERC silicon solar cells is deposited at high temperatures, which is not suitable for PSCs. Encouragingly, we found in our work that a polysilane film derived from the hydrolysis and in situ cross-linking of tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) at a low temperature could play the same role. To yield an insulating layer on the perovskite film at room temperature, TMOS, the simplest and most hydrolyzable alkoxysilane, was adopted in this study. As schematically illustrated in Fig. 1b, the hydrolyzable alkoxysilane groups on TMOS can be hydrolyzed in the presence of moisture or alcohol to form silanol (Si–OH). Subsequently, the silanol converts into –Si–O–Si– networks via condensation to form a polysilane layer.54–56 The hydrolysis and subsequent cross-linking reactions can occur without the need of initiators and rigorous post-treatments.56,57 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed to confirm the formation of the polysilane film from TMOS. As shown in Fig. 1c, the peak at 3370 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching vibrations of Si–OH, originating from the residual –OH groups on the –Si–O–Si– chains. The peaks appearing at 1095 cm−2 and 830 cm−2 are ascribed to the anti-symmetric stretching and symmetric stretching vibrations of the –Si–O–Si– chains, respectively, indicating the formation of Si–O–Si chains via polycondensation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to study the interactions between polysilane and the perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 1d, the peak centered at a binding energy of 102.1 eV in the polysilane/perovskite film is ascribed to Si 2p, indicating that the Si–O–Si bond exists in the form of polysilane rather than silica (with binding energy ∼103.5 eV) and this result is in good agreement with the FTIR findings. The peak centered at 532.7 eV in the pristine polysilane film can be assigned to O 1s, which is shifted towards lower binding energy by 0.4 eV upon coating the polysilane onto the perovskite layer (Fig. 1e), suggesting a strong interaction between the polysilane and perovskite film. The shift to a lower binding energy indicates the lowered oxidation state of O due to the electron donation from I− to –OH because the Si–OH group on the Si–O–Si network acts as an electrophile (Lewis acid), while the I− in the perovskite is an electron-rich species (Lewis base).51,55 This attractive Lewis acid–base interaction (Si–OH⋯I−) is also beneficial for the defect passivation at the perovskite surface and is conducive to high-efficiency PSCs.51,53,55

The surface morphologies of the perovskite and polysilane/perovskite films are observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements. The top-view SEM image (Fig. 2a) illustrates a compact and pinhole-free morphology of the FA0.92MA0.08PbI3 perovskite film with an average grain size of ∼265 nm. The SEM (Fig. 2b) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra (Fig. S2†) reveal that the polysilane deposition by a solution process does not affect the morphology and crystalline structure of the underneath perovskite layer. The topographic AFM images displayed in Fig. 2c and d demonstrate that the mean roughness of the perovskite layer has been reduced significantly from 49.5 nm to 32.4 nm by polysilane coating. Fig. 2e depicts the height profiles of the grain interiors and grain boundaries (GBs) along the lines marked in Fig. 2c. It reveals that the positions of GBs are much deeper than that of the grain interiors, which can also be concluded from the section-view SEM images of the perovskite film (Fig. S3†) and is in line with the reported results.29,59 The TMOS solution is more prone to sediment at the deeper positions of the perovskite surface (GBs and other valleys) during the spin-coating process. Actually, the GBs are also rich in the PbI2 phase and other component defects, which are more inclined to capture moisture or hydrolyzed silanol (–Si–OH) through hydrogen bonding or Lewis acid–base interaction54,55,58 and initiate the hydrolysis and cross-linking of the TMOS solution. Therefore, polysilane is preferentially deposited at these deeper positions, particularly at GBs. Consequently, the height difference between the grain interiors and GBs is remarkably reduced by around 50% via the polysilane filling, as evidenced by the AFM height profiles shown in Fig. 2f, leading to a non-conformal deposition of the polysilane film.

(e and f) Height profiles along the lines marked in (c) and (d), respectively, showing the height variation between the grain boundaries and grain interiors. 
According to the deposition model discussed above, the non-conformal polysilane film will be thicker at the GB junctions or other deeper positions and much thinner or even absent at the convex position of some big perovskite grains in the case of proper TMOS concentration. To study the distribution of polysilane on the perovskite film, the polysilane/perovskite film (33% TMOS) is cut by the focused ion beam (FIB), and its cross-section view is observed by TEM. As shown in Fig. 3a and S4,† the polysilane layer shows a discontinuous distribution as expected, with some holes reserved on the surface of the perovskite film. The thickness of the polysilane layer is around 15 nm. Therefore, when the spiro-OMeTAD is spread on the polysilane/perovskite film, the photo-generated holes are unlikely to tunnel through the thick insulating polysilane layer and transfer into HTL, and the perovskite–HTL point contacts formed are responsible for the transport of photo-generated holes, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 3b. These point contacts remarkably reduce the contact area of perovskite/HTL and are benign to solar cell performance by decreasing interfacial charge recombination.51–53 To further verify the formation of the quasi-point contacts, the contact potential difference (CPD) map on the perovskite film with and without polysilane coating was characterized via Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy (KPFM) measurements. For these KPFM tests which were conducted in dark, CPD measured is the potential difference between the ITO layer and the gold probe tip of the KPFM setup. Any CPD changes can be ascribed to the internal field inside the perovskite or polysilane/perovskite film.59 It is clear from Fig. 3c and S5† that the big grain interiors with higher CPD values are surrounded by the continuous GBs with lower CPD values for the bare perovskite film, and this result is consistent with the findings in the reported study.59 The lower CPD values at GBs can be possibly attributed to built-in potential around the electrically charged GBs due to the presence of impurities or different types of vacancies.59–62 In striking contrast to the bare perovskite film, the CPD map is wholly reversed after the dielectric polysilane deposition.

(b) Schematical representation point-contact architecture, focusing on the point-contacts and the block zones; (c and d) KPFM results measured in dark showing the CPD maps of the bare perovskite and polysilane/perovskite films, respectively. 
It is apparent from Fig. 3d and S5† that the deeper GBs now possess a higher CPD than the convex position of big grains, featuring isolated darker spots distributed in lighter and continuous stripes, indicating the formation of discrete holes in the discontinuous polysilane layer. As revealed by the TEM image and CPD map of the KPFM results shown in Fig. 3b and 4d, the distribution of point contacts (namely the distance between points) of our PCRR structure is well-tailored within tens to hundreds of nanometers by tuning the thickness of polysilane, whereas the photo-generated hole diffusion lengths are commonly greater than 1 micrometer in mixed halide perovskites.63–66 In this case, the photo-generated holes can effectively drift to the neighboring point contact zones for transfer before being recombined, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 3b. The charge transport in the well-tailored PCRR solar cells will not be hampered, even though the intimate interface contact is regarded as a key to achieving an efficient charge transfer.67,68 The unhindered carrier transport and collection in the PCRR devices is confirmed by the linear relationship of Jscversus light intensity (Fig. 5e, discussed later).

Jsc shows a linear relationship with light density, indicating that charge collection is not hindered by the insulating polysilane layer. 
Before being used in PSCs, the energy levels of the perovskite films with and without polysilane coating are checked. According to the UPS results shown in Fig. S6,†EVBM (valance band maximum) is calculated to be −5.24 eV and −5.39 eV for pristine perovskite and polysilane/perovskite films, respectively (see more detailed discussion in ESI†). The slight downshift (0.15 eV) of EVBM after polysilane coating will not affect the hole transfer in the viewpoint of band alignment.
To investigate the effects of the polysilane film on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, devices with a layout of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/polysilane/spiro-OMeTAD/Au are constructed (Fig. 1a). Solar cells with similar structures but without the polysilane interlayer are also prepared as the control for comparison. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs employing a polysilane layer with different thicknesses that were tuned by varying the concentration of the TMOS solution are displayed in Fig. S7,† and the detailed characteristics are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that PCE boosts remarkably when the perovskite films are treated with a low concentration of the TMOS/isopropanol solution, and the PCE reaches a maximum at 33% of TMOS (volume ratio). Further increase in the TMOS concentration deteriorates the PCE of the devices by lowering Jsc and Voc because the excessively thick insulating layer reduces point-contact zones and thus hampers the charge collection. As displayed in Fig. 4a, the best-performing control device without polysilane gains a PCE of 20.96%, with a Voc of 1.137 V, a Jsc of 23.61 mA cm−2, and a FF of 78.11%. In contrast, the champion PSC based on the PCRR structure delivers a Voc of 1.156 V, a Jsc of 24.91 mA cm−2, and a FF of 78.10%, resulting in an overall high efficiency of 22.49%. It can be seen that the simultaneous enhancements in Jsc and Voc dominate the improved PCE of PCRR-based solar cells, compared with the control device. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra shown in Fig. 4b demonstrate that the PCRR-based PSC has higher EQE values in the whole visible light region (380–750 nm) than that of the control device. The integrated Jsc values of PCRR-based and control devices are 24.33 and 23.03 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in accordance with the values extracted from J–V curves. The stabilized current density and PCE at the maximum power point (MPP) as a function of time are also obtained to assess the stabilized power output of the two devices. As depicted in Fig. 4c, the stabilized PCEs of 21.9% and 20.6% are observed for the devices with and without polysilane modification, respectively, suggesting the stable steady state power output features of the obtained devices. Statistic PCE distribution among 100 separated PSCs shown in Fig. 4d reveals an average PCE of 22.20% and 20.62% for PCRR-based and control devices, respectively, indicating an excellent reliability and reproducibility of our results. Fig. S8 and Table S1† display the J–V characteristics for PCRR-based and control devices measured in both reverse and forward scanning. The hysteresis index (HI), defined as HI = (PCEreverse – PCEfoward)/PCEreverse × 100%, is employed to quantify the degree of hysteresis. The HI value for PCRR-based PSCs is 3.94%, which is slightly smaller than that of the control device (5.35%). The alleviated hysteretic behavior of PCRR-based PSCs can be ascribed to the reduced density of the trap states that are effectively suppressed by the passivation effects of the polysilane layer (has been discussed in detail later).

To assess the impact of the polysilane layer on the interfacial charge transfer dynamics of PSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements were conducted. The Nyquist plots of pristine perovskite-based and polysilane/perovskite-based devices measured at a bias of 0.9 V under dark conditions are shown in Fig. S9.† The equivalent circuit model used to fit the Nyquist plot is shown as an inset, consisting of series resistance (Rs), transport resistance (Rct) associated with the charge transport in the whole device, and recombination resistance (Rrec) related to the charge recombination that occurred both in the bulk perovskite and at the perovskite/HTL (and ETL) interfaces.69,70 Since the perovskite layer and perovskite/ETL are the same for the control and PCRR devices, Rrec is thus mainly affected by the perovskite/HTL interface. The fitting results reveal that the PCRR-based PSC exhibits a much higher Rrec value of 5.84 kΩ as compared to 2.56 kΩ for the control device. The higher Rrec value of PCRR-based solar cells implies a slower charge recombination rate, hence increasing the Voc of PSCs, which is quite consistent with J–V results.
The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (tr-PL) measurements of the perovskite films with and without the polysilane layer coating are monitored to study the passivation capacity of the in situ cross-linked polysilane (33% TMOS solution). The PL intensities are remarkably increased (Fig. 5a), while the average carrier decay lifetime, estimated by fitting the tr-PL results with a bi-exponential function (Table S2†) of the perovskite is significantly increased from 0.55 μs to 0.93 μs after polysilane coating (Fig. 5b), indicating that the non-radiative recombination process of charge carriers at the perovskite/polysilane interface has been largely suppressed71,72 due to the defect passivation capacity of the in situ cross-linked polysilane film with Si–OH groups. The density of the trap states (nt) was estimated by the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method. Fig. 5c and d show the I–V curves of the electron-only device (ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/Au) with and without polysilane inserted between the perovskite and PCBM layers. The perovskite films with polysilane modification have a lower nt value of 6.6 × 1015 cm−3 than the control device (nt = 1.07 × 1016 cm−3), which is due to both the point contact structure with reduced perovskite/PCBM contact areas and the passivation effect of the polysilane with Si–OH groups. The suppressed recombination velocity leads to a significant increase in the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells. In addition, the photovoltaic response of PSCs under different light intensities was also tested. It is observed in Fig. 5e that both the control and PCRR devices show a linear relationship of Jscversus light intensity, indicating that the carrier transport and collection in the PCRR device is not hindered by the formation of point contacts when an insulating polysilane layer with proper thickness is inserted. The relationship of Voc with light intensity is plotted in Fig. 5f. It is known that the slope from kBT/q reflects defect-assisted recombination in the devices.73 It can be seen that the control device shows a slope of 1.73 kBT/q, while PCRR-based devices show a much smaller slope of 1.33 kBT/q, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and q is the electron charge. These results further confirm that the recombination process is greatly inhibited in the PCRR device, which contributes to the enhanced Voc value and partial Jsc increment of the obtained solar cells.
To uncover the factors for the unexpectedly significant enhancement in Jsc, the optical properties of perovskite films with and without polysilane coating are investigated. As shown in Fig. 6a, the two films have similar absorption onsets, which are in line with the EQE results. However, the absorption intensity of the polysilane/perovskite films is more robust than that of the bare perovskite film over the whole investigated zone. It is clear from Fig. 6b that the polysilane/perovskite film exhibits reduced light transmittance. As displayed in Fig. 6c, the refractive indexes are tested to be 3.2 for the perovskite and 1.3 for polysilane by ellipsometric measurements. It is well known that total reflection will occur at the interface when the light passes through from a light dense medium into a light sparse medium. Clearly, the dielectric polysilane layer serves as an optical back-surface mirror delivering an extremely high internal reflection.52 Hence, light trapping within the device is possible, which improves the light-harvesting efficiency, leading to remarkably enhanced Jsc and PCE in return.

Fig. 7a compares the results of stability tests of PSCs with and without polysilane insertion, stored in an ambient environment with ∼30% relative humidity without encapsulation. The solar cell with polysilane gets a 91.4% retention of its initial PCE after 30 days of storage in dark. In contrast, the PCE of control devices drops down to about 69.7% of its original value under the same conditions, suggesting that the in situ cross-linked polysilane film can remarkably improve the humid stability of the devices. The derived contact angles are 81.3° and 42.8° for the polysilane/perovskite and bare perovskite films (Fig. 7b), respectively, indicating a substantial increment in the hydrophobicity of the perovskite upon polysilane coating.56,74,75 The decomposition of the perovskite induced by the moisture in the air is known to result in the formation of the PbI2 phase.76,77 Therefore, we periodically recorded the XRD patterns of the unsealed perovskite films stored in the ambient environments within 10 days, and the results are shown in Fig. 7c. The intensity ratio of PbI2 (2θ = 12.5°) and perovskite (2θ = 13.8°) in XRD patterns, which relates to the decomposition of the perovskite film in the control film, increase faster than that of the polysilane-coated perovskite film. Hence, it can be concluded here that the dense polysilane film with improved hydrophobicity can protect the perovskite against degradation in humid air and greatly enhance the stability of devices.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we developed, in this study, a promising quasi-point contact and rear-reflection (PCRR) structure for PSCs by inserting a dielectric polysilane layer between the perovskite and HTL films. The combination of the decrement of perovskite/HTL contact areas, spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, and interfacial passivation leads to greatly suppressed charge recombination loss. In addition, the vast difference in the refractive index of the perovskite film and polysilane layer brings about remarkable internal reflection within the device, resulting in improved light harvesting, and thus, the output of short-circuit current density. Due to the success in the simultaneous modulation of the charge recombination and light harvesting, the resulting PCRR-PSCs yield a promising efficiency of 22.5% together with improved stability. This study paves a simple but effective way for interface engineering to achieve high-efficiency solar cells.
4. Experimental
Material and device fabrication
An etched indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) glass was sequentially cleaned by deionized water, ethanol, and isopropanol (IPA). After the substrates were treated by UV-ozone (UVO) for 30 min, a SnO2 colloid (Alfa, diluted by water to 2.5 wt%) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 180 °C for 30 min. The SnO2 film was modified by spin-coating an LiOH aqueous solution (10 mg mL−1) at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by additional annealing at 150 °C for 30 min. A PbI2 solution (1.5 M, in DMF:DMSO = 9:1) was spin-coated onto SnO2 at 1500 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 70 °C for 30 s in a glove box filled with N2. After the PbI2 films cooled down to room temperature, a mixture solution of FAI:MAI:MACl (90 mg:6.4 mg:9 mg in 1 mL IPA) was spin-coated onto PbI2 at 2000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 20 min in ambient condition (30–40% humidity). For the TMOS treatment, the TMOS/isopropanol solution with TMOS concentration varied from 28% to 65% (volume ratio relative to isopropanol) was spin-coated onto the perovskite film at 3000 rpm without any further thermal processing. The modified films were taken out of the glove box and exposed to the humid air (40% humidity) for 20 min to induce the hydrolysis and cross-linking of TMOS. After that, the films were transferred into the glove box again and a spiro-OMeTAD solution consisting of 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 30 μL tert-butylpyridine (tBP), and 35 μL lithium bis(tri-fluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) stock solution (260 mg LiTFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) in chlorobenzene was spread as a hole transport layer. Finally, 80 nm of the Au film was thermally evaporated on top of the cell.
Measurements and characterization
Photocurrent–voltage curves were obtained using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter, under one sun illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). The light intensity was adjusted by a standard mono-silicon cell. The active area of the tested device was masked to be 0.06 cm2. The EQE spectra of the devices were measured by a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3-011 (Enli Technology Co. Ltd., Taiwan). XRD patterns were recorded by D/max 2500 with Cu Kα1 radiation at a scan rate of 5° min−1. The absorbance of the perovskite film was measured by a UV-vis spectrometer (HITACHI U3010) configured with an integrating sphere. The refractive index of polysilane films was tested by an ellipsometer (M 2000VI). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed using an ESCALA250XI XPS equipment (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with Al Kα X-ray radiation as the X-ray source. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed using TENSOR-27 (Bruker Spectroscopy). The scanning electron microscopy was performed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800). The steady-state photoluminescence spectra and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were obtained using an FLS980 spectrometer. All the atomic force microscopy (AFM) characterizations were carried out in an Ar-filled glove box using an AFM microscope (Bruker Corp., Dimension Icon). Kelvin Probe Force Microscopic (KPFM) measurements were conducted with conductive probes (NSG10/Pt, NT-MDT). The contact angle test was performed using DSA 100 (KRüSS GmbH). The polysilane/perovskite film for cross-section view TEM measurements was cut by a Helios Nanolab G3 CX focused ion beam using an electron beam microscope. High-resolution TEM images were obtained on a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV.
