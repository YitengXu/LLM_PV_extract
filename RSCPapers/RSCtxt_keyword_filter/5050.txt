    , Accepted 22nd December 2015First published on 23rd December 2015AbstractNew star-shaped hole transport materials including a 1,3,5-triazine core have been successfully synthesized and investigated for high performance perovskite solar cells. A maximum power conversion efficiency of 13.2% has been achieved by employing 2,2′,2′′-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tris(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-4H-indeno[1,2-b]thiophen-6-amine). The power conversion efficiencies of hole transport materials were comparable to that of the standard spiro-OMeTAD (13.8%).
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (e.g. (RNH3)PbX3 (R = alkyl, X = halogen)) have been recently receiving great attention owing to their outstanding features such as high efficiency1–4 and low cost. Moreover, organic–metal halide perovskites are direct band gap materials which exhibit strong light harvesting characteristics within the visible solar spectrum. Since hybrid perovskite solar cells were first demonstrated by Kojima et al.,5 several research groups have reported improved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).6–10 Recently, a PCE of over 20% has been reported,11 and it has been adduced that perovskite solar cells can compete with conventional silicon solar cells and/or copper indium gallium selenide. Therefore, perovskite solar cells are considered as both efficient light absorbers and electron–hole transport materials. Meanwhile, hole transport materials (HTMs) play a central role dominating the photovoltaic characteristics of perovskite solar cells. Until now, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) has been widely utilized for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells, exhibiting a high PCE surpassing 17%.12 In many cases, spiro-OMeTAD appears to be an excellent HTM in terms of the PCE of perovskite solar cells. However, spiro-OMeTAD is highly expensive due to its complicated synthesis and difficulties in the purification and so on. For commercial purposes, therefore, the exploration of alternative HTMs with high performance and cost-effectiveness is urgently required. In this regard, various kinds of small molecule and polymeric HTMs13,14 have been developed and reported as potential alternatives to spiro-OMeTAD. Especially, small molecule HTMs have been widely developed because they are relatively cheap and easy to purify compared to spiro-OMeTAD. Namely, various types of small molecule HTMs such as pyrene-,15 carbazole-,16 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-,17 tetrahiafulvalene-,18 olefin-,19 butadiene-,20 and N,N,N′,N′-tetraphenylbenzidine21-based derivatives have been reported. Recently, we have also reported star-shaped small molecule HTMs consisting of an electron-deficient 1,3,5-triazine core and an electron-rich diphenylamino unit.22 The maximum power conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic device employing them reached 12.5% under 1 sun illumination (cf. 13.5% of spiro-OMeTAD based solar cell). In general, however, the small molecule HTMs exhibit relatively low PCEs compared to those of spiro-OMeTAD due to formation of aggregates on the perovskite surface and lower hole mobility. In this regard, efforts to develop more efficient HTMs for replacing spiro-OMeTAD are still needed.
Herein, we report two star-shaped HTMs with a triazine core (i.e. 7,7′,7′′-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tris(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-amine) (Triazine-Flu) and 2,2′,2′′-(1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-triyl)tris(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-4H-indeno[1,2-b]thiophen-6-amine) (Triazine-InT)) for preparing efficient perovskite solar cells. The chemical structures of the HTMs are depicted in Fig. 1. Especially, the effects of different linkage moieties (i.e. 9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluorene and 4,4-dimethyl-4H-indeno[1,2-b]thiophene) on the photovoltaic performances of perovskite solar cells were systematically investigated to understand the planarity–mobility relationship.23,24 The synthetic scheme for the preparation of HTMs is shown in Fig. 2.25–27 Aminations of 2 and 5 with bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine (1) were performed by the Buchwald reaction. The stannyl derivatives 4 and 7 were synthesized by lithiation of 3 and 6 with chlorotrimethyl stannane in THF. The key step for their synthesis is the Stille coupling reaction of cyanuric chloride with 4 and 7. The target compounds were obtained in overall yields of ∼35–55%.

The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the mesoporous (mp)-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM (Triazine-Flu and Triazine-InT, respectively) films are shown in Fig. 3(a). The mp-TiO2/perovskite film coated with Triazine-InT exhibited relatively strong light absorption compared to that of Triazine-Flu in the range of 450–570 nm. The UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectra of the HTMs measured in chlorobenzene solution are also displayed in Fig. 3(b).

As summarized in Table 1, the UV-Vis absorption peaks (λabs) of Triazine-Flu and Triazine-InT were observed at 436 nm and 489 nm, respectively. As a result, the λabs of Triazine-InT was shown to be red-shifted (ca. 53 nm) by introducing a thiophene moiety instead of benzene. The absorption coefficient of Triazine-InT was shown to be much higher than that of Triazine-Flu as shown in Table 1, indicating that the transition is accompanied by a significant change in the electronic charge distribution through the all conjugated system upon excitation. The fluorescence spectra of the HTMs were also revealed to be red-shifted by introducing a thiophene moiety into the molecule. The fluorescence spectrum of Triazine-InT exhibited the maximum emission at 574 nm with the Stoke's shift of 85 nm, which is smaller than that of Triazine-Flu (i.e. 110 nm). This result demonstrates that a relatively small structure change in the excited state occurs in Triazine-InT compared to the Triazine-Flu owing to the slight interaction between triazine and the thiophenyl unit in the indeno[1,2-b]thiophene.28 From the absorption onset in thin films, the optical band gaps of the HTMs were estimated as shown in Table 1. In addition, the HOMO level of the HTMs was determined through a traditional electrochemical characterization. The HOMO levels29 of Triazine-Flu and Triazine-InT were measured to be −5.29 and −5.26 eV, respectively (Fig. S3†). The result shows that the HTMs possess a suitable energy level compared with that of a CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite (−5.43 eV) for an efficient hole transport. Fig. 3(c) also shows a comparative diagram of the energy levels for the mp-TiO2 scaffold layer, CH3NH3PbI3, and each HTM.

The cross-sectional field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of the prepared perovskite solar cells are displayed in Fig. 4a and b and S4,† showing a well-defined multi-layer structure with clear interfaces. The thickness of the TiO2 scaffold film incorporated with perovskite and the Au electrode was ∼300 nm and 70 nm, respectively, whereas those of the HTM layers were ∼200 nm to obtain the optimum device performance.

From the TG and DSC analysis, it was found that the HTMs showed a good thermal stability up to 400 °C. Moreover, Triazine-Flu and Triazine-InT showed an endothermic peak at 178.6 °C and 180.7 °C, indicating their melting temperature (Tm) as shown in Fig. 4c and d. This clearly indicates their intrinsic ability to form a crystalline structure when they are fabricated as a film.

Fig. 5 shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of perovskite solar cells employing the synthesized HTMs and spiro-OMeTAD. The photovoltaic parameters evaluated from the experiments are also summarized in Table 2. The PCEs of the cells employing the HTMs were shown to be almost comparable with that of spiro-OMeTAD. We have fabricated more than 20 solar cells for each HTM (Fig. S8†) and the best efficiencies for Triazine-Flu, Triazine-InT, and spiro-OMeTAD were observed as 12.6%, 13.2%, and 13.8%, respectively. Notably, the Triazine-InT showed the highest value of the open-circuit voltage (Voc) among the tested devices. The fill factor (ff) of the cell with Triazine-InT was shown to be enhanced compared with that of Triazine-Flu. It is deduced that the conductivity of HTMs is one of the major factors determining the cell performance.30

The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the solar cells fabricated with different HTMs are also compared with each other in the inset of Fig. 5. The integrated photocurrent densities of the cells employing Triazine-Flu, Triazine-InT, and spiro-OMeTAD were shown to be 19.42, 19.66, and 19.87 mA cm−2, respectively, which are well consistent with the Jsc values evaluated from the J–V curves. As a result, Triazine-InT resulted in a relatively predominant cumulative IPCE value compared to that of Triazine-Flu, which is also almost identical with that of spiro-OMeTAD, demonstrating both high hole mobility and appropriate energy level of the HTMs.
The hole mobilities of the HTMs were measured from the Tafel plots (Fig. 6(a)). The hole mobilities of spiro-OMeTAD, Triazine-Flu, and Triazine-InT are shown to be 2.22 × 10−4, 2.81 × 10−4, and 4.41 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively.31 Furthermore, four point probe measurements were performed on spiro-OMeTAD, Triazine-Flu, and Triazine-InT films. Sheet resistances of 1.65 × 108, 1.47 × 108, and 1.15 × 108 Ω sq.−1 were obtained, respectively. Accounting for the thickness of each of the films, the calculated hole mobilities were 3.03 × 10−4, 3.40 × 10−4, and 4.35 × 10−4 S cm−1, respectively, and in good agreement with the values obtained via the Tafel plots. As expected previously, the hole mobility of Triazine-InT is revealed to be higher than that of Triazine-Flu and spiro-OMeTAD. The detailed surface sheet resistance and hole mobility results are shown in Fig. S7 and Table S1 (ESI†).

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements have also been performed to analyse the recombination properties of the HTMs. The Nyquist plots of the photovoltaic devices with HTMs measured in the dark are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The equivalent circuit model for impedance spectra analysis of perovskite solar cells is shown in Fig. S6 (inset) (ESI†). The magnitude of the main arc is dominated by the recombination resistance (Rrec), which drops with the increasing forward bias voltage as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†).20 The Rrec values were revealed to be significantly increased under the identical bias conditions by introducing a thiophene moiety into the HTM (i.e.Triazine-InT), demonstrating the decrease in the charge recombination. Moreover the electron lifetime (τr = Cμ × Rrec) also supports a slower electron recombination rate of Triazine-InT compared to that of Triazine-Flu (Fig. 6(b)).32,33 This could be mainly due to the faster charge transport in Triazine-InT including a thiophene moiety compared with Triazine-Flu. This result is also well consistent with the Voc values evaluated from the J–V curves. The longer electron lifetime contributed to a higher Voc.
In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized new star-shaped small molecule HTMs (Triazine-Flu and Triazine-InT) with a 1,3,5-triazine core for high performance perovskite solar cells. Their photovoltaic characteristics were also systematically analysed and compared with those of spiro-OMeTAD. Triazine-InT with a indeno[1,2-b]thio moiety exhibited relatively strong and red-shifted light absorption properties as well as a higher hole mobility compared to those of Triazine-Flu, which is also almost identical with that of spiro-OMeTAD. It is deduced that the conductivity of HTMs is one of the major factors determining the cell performance. The energy levels of the HTMs were well matched with that of the light absorber (CH3NH3PbI3). Notably, the HOMO levels of Triazine-Flu and Triazine-InT were revealed to be higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD. The photovoltaic cells employing Triazine-InT and Triazine-Flu showed excellent PCEs of 13.2% and 12.6%, which are comparable to that of spiro-OMeTAD (13.8%). In this regard, the triazine derivatives are considered to be highly promising candidates as HTMs.
