    , Accepted 6th January 2022First published on 7th January 2022AbstractAll-inorganic tin halide perovskite compounds, such as CsSnI3, have attracted attention in the field of solar cells due to their eco-friendly properties. It is quite a challenge to fabricate high-quality CsSnI3 perovskite films with low defect density due to the low defect tolerance and overquick crystallization growth rate. Herein, we propose a simple yet effective method to modulate the dynamic balance between the growth and nucleation of perovskite crystals for black orthorhombic phase CsSnI3. We found that well-crystallized CsSnI3 thin films can be easily obtained through two-step thermal annealing at low temperatures of 40 °C and 70 °C. We further introduced 1-(4-carboxyphenyl)-2-thiourea to coordinate with surface undercoordinated Sn2+ cations of CsSnI3 thin films through CS and CO functional groups, significantly decreasing the defect density. The CsSnI3 perovskite solar cells based on a printable c-TiO2/m-TiO2/Al2O3/NiO/carbon mesoporous framework achieved a power conversion efficiency of 8.03% with high reproducibility, which is the best efficiency among those reported for all-inorganic CsSnI3 mesoporous perovskite solar cells to date. Furthermore, the corresponding devices retained 90% of the initial efficiency after 3000 hours of storage in a N2-filled glovebox.
Introduction
Over the last 10 years, continuous efforts have been made by scientists to develop perovskite solar cells (PSCs) that successfully convert solar energy into electricity.1–3 However, the large-scale production, transportation, installation and operation of organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite-based solar cells may pose severe risks for both human beings and other living creatures due to the toxicity issue of lead.4,5 Therefore, tin halide perovskites have been selected as the priority candidates of all reported lead-free perovskites in terms of the photovoltaic effect.6–9 As a potential competitor, the fully inorganic perovskite-structured CsSnI3 possesses natural structural stability, thermodynamic stability, and low exciton binding energy.10–12 In addition, the black orthorhombic (B-γ) CsSnI3 has a bandgap of about 1.3 eV at room temperature, which is ideal to achieve a high-power conversion efficiency (PCE) in a single-junction cell according to the Shockley–Queisser limit.13 However, we have noticed that CsSnI3-based PSCs currently face the problems of poor stability and inferior device performance, which are mainly caused by uncontrolled crystal growth during perovskite crystalline layer formation.14,15
At present, with the increasing interest in research on the application of CsSnI3 in photovoltaics, many attempts have been made to enhance the respective device performance by improving the film quality, for instance, solvent engineering,16 additive engineering,17,18 dimension engineering and so on.19 Although being a major link in the CsSnI3 film forming process, a little attention has been paid to the annealing procedure. As reported, a common method used for CsSnI3 film fabrication in most laboratories is one-step thermal annealing at about 70 °C for about 5 min after spin-coating the precursor solution (usually DMF/DMSO mixed solvents).20–22 This process is successful in forming high-quality organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite films by finely varying the annealing temperature and time. However, due to the fast crystal growth with incomplete nucleation during film formation for tin-based grains which used one-step thermal annealing, the corresponding tin halide perovskite films usually show numerous pinholes, few grain boundaries and low crystallinity.21–23 Previous investigation on the crystallization kinetics of tin halide perovskites has revealed a complicated relationship between the crystallization rate and temperature. Therefore, it is very difficult to control the dynamic balance between the growth and nucleation of CsSnI3 films by monotonically tuning the temperature during the thermal annealing treatment. In such a case, one would expect that a sufficiently high energy provided by one-time annealing accelerates the crystallization growth process during film formation, leading to an overquick grain growth rate. Therefore, seeking a suitable annealing approach is very important for controlling the excessive grain growth and obtain high-quality CsSnI3 films.
In addition to the film formation process, the undercoordinated Sn2+ ions on the perovskite surface easily adsorb oxygen molecules through the unsaturated Sn dangling bonds (adsorption energy ∼−2.55 eV).24,25 The adsorbed oxygen molecules exhibit quite high reactivity to the external environment. For instance, on excitation, the generated charge carriers in the CsSnI3 layer facilitate the transformation of oxygen molecules into superoxide radicals, which in turn can induce Sn2+ oxidation and form deep level defects.25,26 The defects are the main nonradiative recombination centres, having great negative effects on the open circuit voltage (VOC) and PCE of devices27,28 Several attempts have been made to decrease the unexpected defect density. For instance, Li et al. utilized the thioamide passivation strategy to modulate the defect state density at surfaces and grain boundaries in CsSnI3 perovskites.14 Recently, Ye et al. used localized electron density engineering to restrict undercoordinated Sn2+, resulting in reduced defect density and relatively grain-ordered CsSnI3 films.29 Herein, we combine the aforementioned two principal issues, proposing the two-step temperature annealing and surface cationic coordination dual treatment strategy (DTS) to achieve high-performance CsSnI3 PSCs. The first annealing step at a low temperature of 40 °C for 5 min slows down the crystal growth of CsSnI3 films and produces many small crystal grains. The second annealing step at 70 °C for 5 min provides additional energy for completing the crystallization of the perovskite crystal. We further treated CsSnI3 films with surface coordination using 1-(4-carboxyphenyl)-2-thiourea (CPT) with CS and CO functional groups which can have strong coordinative interaction with surface undercoordinated Sn2+ through lone electron pairs, resulting in a reduced deep level defect density and an enhanced carrier lifetime of the treated CsSnI3 perovskite. The optimized CsSnI3 PSCs based on a printable c-TiO2/m-TiO2/Al2O3/NiO/carbon mesoporous framework achieved a PCE of 8.03% with high reproducibility, which is the best performance among those reported for all-inorganic CsSnI3-based mesoporous PSCs so far. Furthermore, the corresponding device can retain 90% of the initial PCE after 3000 hours of storage in a N2-filled glovebox (H2O: 0.01 ppm and O2: 0.00 ppm). This strategy provides a new solution for the realization of high performance all-inorganic CsSnI3 PSCs.
Results and discussion
We first used scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization to observe the top-view of the microstructure of B-γ-CsSnI3 thin films at different thermal annealing temperatures (20 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C, and 70 °C) within the same annealing time. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI),† the perovskite grains hardly begin to grow in an orderly manner when the annealing temperature is below 40 °C. The grain size increased to about 25 nm after annealing at 40 °C although there were numerous gaps in the film. Then, the grains were evidently coarsened with increasing annealing temperature. In the end, significantly enlarged grains were observed as the annealing temperature increased to 70 °C. In order to evaluate the effect of temperature on evaporating solvents in the precursor during the annealing process, we prepared six samples containing the same precursor solution which reached a supersaturation concentration. Then we recorded their weight changes and calculated the corresponding solvent volatilization rate after annealing at different temperatures (20 °C, 30 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C, and 70 °C) at an interval of one-minute. As shown in Fig. S2,† in the first one-minute interval, the volatilization rate was relatively high and the values were almost the same at different annealing temperatures, while the grains started to grow at this time. Upon prolonging the annealing time, all samples showed a downward trend of the volatilization rate, and the volatilization rate values of all samples were roughly consistent over the same time intervals, eliminating the disturbance of solvent volatilization rate on grain growth.30 The evolution of grain size and the growth rate as a function of the annealing temperature is shown in Fig. 1a and b. The growth of B-γ-CsSnI3 films is extremely slow at low temperature and then becomes rapid above 40 °C together with an obvious increase of grain size from ∼25 nm to ∼950 nm. We put forward to modulate the dynamic crystal growth process by using an initially slow rate followed by a subsequently fast growth rate method of the two-step thermal annealing process for CsSnI3 films as illustrated in Fig. 1c.

Fig. 2a shows the SEM images of CsSnI3 films employing different annealing procedures within the same annealing time. The film treated with the 20 °C & 70 °C annealing process shows many cracks on the surface and some grains are partially stacked with each other, which is similar to the sample with 70 °C annealing only. This result can be due to the small effect of the grain growth in the first stage on the whole at a low initial temperature of 20 °C. In contrast, with the aid of the controlled crystal growth process by initially slow and subsequently fast growth rate methods by simply tuning the annealing temperatures to 40 °C & 70 °C, the film showed close-packed grains with fewer pinholes and cracks. As for the 60 °C & 70 °C annealing process, an initial high temperature induces rapid growth at the first stage, which aggravates the imbalance between the grain growth and nucleation process and damages the film quality. Then, we tracked and analysed the evolution of the crystal phase of CsSnI3 films during the two-step temperature annealing process by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements (Fig. 2b). We noticed that the peaks of the precursors (SnI2 and CsI) appeared in the 70 °C, 20 °C & 70 °C, 60 °C & 70 °C annealing samples, indicating an incomplete conversion of perovskite components due to a fast crystal growth rate. With the aid of step-down growth rate in the 40 °C & 70 °C annealing process, the XRD peaks of SnI2 and CsI disappeared and the obtained perovskites were in accordance with the orthorhombic (B-γ) structure of CsSnI3 with an enhanced peak intensity.31Fig. 2c shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the CsSnI3 films fabricated by different annealing procedures. Benefitting from the high-quality film treated by 40 °C & 70 °C annealing, an enhanced optical absorption was obtained in the almost whole absorption region for B-γ CsSnI3. Moreover, we calculated the bandgap of CsSnI3 to be 1.305 eV through the UV-vis absorption spectra, indicating its suitability to collect photons and generate great photocurrent of the resulting devices under light illumination.32

In order to further reduce the deep level defects induced by the surface undercoordinated Sn2+ ions, we introduced CPT into the CsSnI3 perovskite films and then carried out 40 °C & 70 °C two-step temperature annealing. Fig. 3a shows the possible positions of formation of strong coordination interactions and electrostatic interactions where the lone electron pairs in the S donor, O donor and amino functional group are delocalized to the 5p empty orbitals of surface undercoordinated Sn2+ (4d105s2) in CsSnI3.14,20,33 We have performed liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization studies with the aim of understanding the detailed interaction between Sn2+ and CPT within the films. Fig. 3b shows the 13C NMR spectra of the pristine CPT, SnI2–CPT and CsI–SnI2–CPT samples which were fabricated with the same concentration in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide solution (DMSO-d6). The resonance signal at δ = 167.4 and 181.5 ppm for pristine CPT could be attributed to the 13C chemical shift in the CO and CS units at 5 and 6 positions which are shown in the inset of Fig. 3b. Both resonance signals shifted positively to 168.5 and 182.8 ppm for SnI2–CPT and CsI–SnI2–CPT samples (the resonance signals of the SnI2–CPT sample were covered by those of the CsI–SnI2–CPT sample), verifying the appearance of the coordination interactions between Sn2+ and the CO, CS functional groups of CPT.34 We further conducted the FTIR measurements to acquire more details about the interaction between CPT and CsSnI3. The FTIR spectra of CPT, SnI2–CPT, and CsI–SnI2–CPT complex powder samples are shown in Fig. 3c. In comparison to the pure CPT, the CS stretching vibration peak (1414 cm−1), CO stretching vibration peak (1685 cm−1) and N–H bending vibration peak (1523 cm−1) exhibited an obvious redshift to 1402 cm−1, 1670 cm−1 and 1520 cm−1 in both the SnI2–CPT and CsI–SnI2–CPT samples. The red-shift of vibration peaks means that the bond strength between sulfur (oxygen and nitrogen) and carbon reduces when the Sn2+–CPT complex forms, demonstrating a strong coordination interaction between Sn2+ and the electron donor (sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen) of CPT instead of only physically adsorbing on the surface of CsSnI3.35 We also noticed that the N–H bending vibration peak showed a relatively weak shift compared with others, suggesting that the bonding between CS, CO and Sn2+ is the dominant coordination type in CPT-treated perovskites. Such an interaction was confirmed by XPS measurements as well. Fig. 3d presents the surface XPS spectra (Sn 3d) of SnI2, SnI2–CPT and CsI–SnI2–CPT films. In the XPS spectra of neat SnI2, the two main peaks at 486.7 eV and 495.2 eV are ascribed to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 for Sn2+, respectively, while in SnI2–CPT and CsI–SnI2–CPT samples, the characteristic peak binding energy of Sn2+ shifts to lower binding energy (∼0.2 eV), suggesting the change of chemical states on the surface of Sn2+. This result further verifies that Sn2+ from the perovskite can be the active site to coordinate with the CO, CS functional groups of CPT.

We further performed the XPS characterization and space-charge limited current (SCLC) technique to analyse the chemical-state and trap-state of the perovskite film surface correlated with the effect of CPT on restraining oxidation and defects induced by undercoordinated Sn2+. Fig. 4a shows that the Sn4+ ratio in the pristine CsSnI3 film is relatively high, indicating serious oxidation at the perovskite film surface. It is worth noting that the content of Sn4+ was much decreased after CPT addition, leading to narrower peak widths compared with those without CPT, which also suggests that the surface cationic coordination is essential for inhibiting the oxidation of Sn2+ at the surface of CsSnI3 films.14 Generally, the conversion of Sn2+ to Sn4+ is regarded as the main source of defect formation in Sn-based perovskites.36–38 We carried out SCLC to calculate the trap state density (Nt) directly according to the following eqn (1). (1)where VTFL is the trap-filled limit voltage, ε0 and ε are the vacuum permittivity and the relative dielectric constant, respectively. e and L represent the elementary charge and the perovskite film thickness.39–41 The VTFL of the pristine CsSnI3 film was estimated to be 1.12 V, signifying a hole trap-state density of 1.44 × 1016 cm−3. After treating with CPT, the VTFL reduced to 0.66 V, leading to a significant low trap-state density of 8.47 × 1015 cm−3, confirming that CPT can efficaciously decrease the trap-state density of CsSnI3 films.

(c) Steady PL and (d) time-resolved PL spectra of pristine CsSnI3 and CsSnI3–CPT films. 
Furthermore, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) characterization was carried out to understand the effect of CPT on the trap states of the perovskite light absorbers on top of glass substrates (Fig. 4c). In PL measurements, we confined the PL excitation region to a localized area to study the trap states close to the surface. As previously reported, the presence of trap states can cause band bending close to the surface of the perovskite film, leading to a bandgap lower than that of the bulk with a red-shifted PL peak.42 As a result, the PL peak intensity of the sample film showed an obvious increase (∼320%) with a slight blue shift in wavelength by 6 nm from 951 nm after introducing CPT. It can be inferred that more photogenerated free carriers are consumed by trap-assisted nonradiative recombination in the pristine CsSnI3 film, which verifies that there is decreased defect density inside the CsSnI3–CPT light absorber.43–45Fig. 4d displays the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the pristine CsSnI3 and CsSnI3–CPT samples. The PL lifetimes of each sample were extracted by fitting the decay curve with a double-exponential decay eqn (2). Y = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2)(2)where the rapid decay lifetime component τ1 can be attributed to the quenching of charge carriers, while the relatively slower decay lifetime τ2 originates from the bimolecular radiative recombination in the bulk perovskite.46,47 The detailed fitted parameters are listed in Table S1.† After introducing CPT, the ratio of τ1 decreases from 70.3% (pristine) to 51.8% (CPT), and the corresponding lifetime constant rises from 4.5 ns (pristine) to 10.6 ns (CPT), indicating a decreased trap-state density in CsSnI3 perovskite. In addition, the lifetime constant of τ2 increases from 18.1 ns (pristine) to 27.5 ns (CPT), signifying that the surface cationic coordination strategy can efficiently prolong the carrier lifetime and suppress the trap-assisted nonradiative recombination in the perovskite film. Consequentially, compared with the calculated average PL lifetime of the pristine CsSnI3 sample (8.5 ns), the average PL lifetime increases considerably to 18.8 ns with CPT treatment.
The performance of the dual treatment strategy (DTS)-treated CsSnI3 solar cells was evaluated through photovoltaic measurements. The devices were fabricated within a printable mesoscopic metal oxide framework of a TiO2/Al2O3/NiO/carbon counter electrode without sealing, which is illustrated in Fig. S3.† In this device structure, each layer has its own thickness, which is a 50 nm-thick compact TiO2 layer, a 400 nm-thick mesoporous TiO2 layer, a 450 nm-thick Al2O3 insulating layer, an 800 nm-thick NiO layer and a 10 μm-thick carbon counter electrode.48 We selected this mesoporous structure because it can eliminate the side effects from any organic charge transport materials and the hydrophilicity of penetrating metal electrodes used in many systems, possessing a figure of merit of long-term stability. Therefore, this can give the sole advantages of CsSnI3 itself.48,49 At first, we compared the effect of the addition of different concentrations of CPT (with 0, 5, 10 and 15 mol% CPT) on the photovoltaic performance separately. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves in Fig. S4a† showed that 10 mol% CPT-containing PSCs possessed the highest PCE among the different ratios of CPT-containing PSCs. All photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S2.† For the sake of simplicity, we use ‘CPT’ to indicate 10 mol% CPT in the following discussion, given that it was the optimal concentration. Then, we visually compared the effects of two-step temperature annealing, surface cationic coordination with CPT and the DTS on the performance of devices through the typical J–V curves under AM 1.5 G one sun illumination. As shown in Fig. S5,† the DTS, benefitting from the advantages of two-step temperature annealing and surface cationic coordination, has the most significant effect on improving the efficiency of CsSnI3-based solar cells. Fig. 5a exhibits the J–V curves of the best-performing DTS-treated CsSnI3 solar cells and the pristine CsSnI3 solar cells which were measured in reverse scan (RS) and forward scan (FS) directions. The corresponding detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table S3.† The pristine CsSnI3 device exhibits an inferior PCE (RS) of 2.04%, VOC of 0.28 V, JSC of 16.2 mA cm−2, and FF of 45% with an obvious hysteresis. Comparatively, the DTS-treated CsSnI3 solar cell presents an overall PCE (RS) of 8.03%, VOC of 0.52 V, JSC of 23.4 mA cm−2, and FF of 66% with negligible hysteresis. Especially, an evident VOC improvement from 0.28 to 0.52 V and the decreased hysteresis are associated with the lower trap density of the perovskite film.50,51 A prominent increase of JSC from 16.2 mA cm−2 to 23.4 mA cm−2 can be attributed to the reduced trap-induced barrier between the perovskite and the charge transport layer, thus leading to an enhanced charge collection and transport performance. It is also remarkable that the PCE here is the highest among those reported for all CsSnI3-based mesoporous PSCs to date, which is shown in Fig. S6 and Table S4.† This great enhancement signifies that the regulation in film formation and the inhibition of trap-state density are indispensable to obtain high-performance CsSnI3-based solar cells. Fig. 5b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding PSCs without and with DTS modification. The EQE value of the DTS-treated CsSnI3 device shows a significant enhancement compared to that of the pristine device within the whole absorption range, leading to an obvious increase of integrated current density from 15.6 to 23.2 mA cm−2. In particular in the long-wavelength region, the higher EQE value of the DTS-treated device can be attributed to the decreased trap-induced nonradiative recombination and thus higher electron collection efficiency, which are also evidenced by the smaller slope (1.24 kBT/q) in the light intensity-dependent VOC characterization (Fig. S7a†) and the larger exponent α (JSC ∝ Iα and α for the DTS-treated sample is closer to 1) in the light intensity-dependent JSC characterization (Fig. S7b†).52,53 Fig. S8 and S9† present the PCE statistical distributions and the corresponding photovoltaic parameter distribution diagrams of the devices without and with DTS treatment, confirming that the devices had consistently higher PCE and exhibited higher reproducibility after DTS treatment.

(c) Steady-state photocurrent density and power output for the best-performing DTS-treated CsSnI3 solar cell. (d) Long-term stability measurements of the unencapsulated pristine and DTS-treated devices stored in a N2-filled glovebox. 
The steady-state output of the DTS-treated CsSnI3 solar cell at the maximum power point in air is shown in Fig. 5c, exhibiting a stabilized output of 7.82% at 0.38 V toward the 300 s scan, which is on the verge of the PCE value from its acquired J–V curve. We then monitored the PCE evolution of the unencapsulated pristine CsSnI3 solar cell and DTS-treated CsSnI3 solar cell which were stored in a N2-filled glove box (H2O: 0.01 ppm and O2: 0.00 ppm). As shown in Fig. 5d, the DTS-treated device maintained >90% of its initial efficiency, while the pristine device underwent fast degradation and retained merely 27% of its original efficiency after storing for 3000 hours. For the encapsulated pristine device and DTS-treated device stored under ambient-air conditions (humidity: 60% and temperature: 25 °C), the DTS-treated device maintained ∼86% of its initial PCE during the whole 120 h. The PCE of the pristine device almost disappeared after 85 h of storage (Fig. S10†). In addition, we also observed that both JSC and VOC degraded more slowly in the DTS-treated CsSnI3 device compared with that of the pristine CsSnI3 device, signifying a lower defect density in the former.23 Furthermore, Fig. S11† shows that the encapsulated DTS-treated CsSnI3 solar cell maintained 87% of its initial PCE under 100 min one sun continuous illumination in an air environment, while the pristine CsSnI3 device retained only 40% of its initial PCE during the identical conditions. These strong pieces of evidence mean that the dual treatment strategy can effectively enhance the stability of CsSnI3-based devices.
To further investigate the processes of carrier recombination and transportation in the operating devices, transient photovoltage/photocurrent decay measurements (TPV/TPC) were performed at different open-circuit voltages. The operation principles and experimental details of the TPV/TPC measurements have been described previously.54 As presented in Fig. 6a, the recombination lifetimes obtained by fitting the TPV curves decline when the charge carrier concentration rises upon increasing the forward bias (determined by the incident illumination intensity). The recombination lifetimes, as a function of VOC, show similar slopes in the pristine device and DTS-treated device, suggesting that both devices have the same recombination mechanism. The DTS-treated device exhibited a longer recombination lifetime (τrec ≈ 40.9 μs at 310 mV) than that of the pristine device (τrec ≈ 28.8 μs at 310 mV) at the identical forward bias, implying that the device with DTS treatment has fewer defects and lower charge recombination probabilities. This could explain the enhancement of VOC and FF compared with the pristine device.55 A similar behaviour has been shown in Fig. 6b. The charge transport lifetimes, obtained from the TPC curves of the DTS-treated device (τtr ≈ 19.5 μs at 310 mV), are shorter than that of the pristine device (τtr ≈ 28.1 μs at 310 mV), indicating increased charge collection efficiency and transport performance. In addition, we calculated the diffusion length (L) according to eqn (3). (3)where d is the film thickness. The device shows an enhanced diffusion length from 290 nm to 483 nm after DTS treatment. The longer diffusion length ensures an efficient charge collection process, explaining the acquired higher JSC in comparison to the pristine device.56 As we can see in Fig. 6c, the device treated with DTS exhibited lower dark current density compared with the pristine device, which indicates the corresponding lower bulk defects in the modified CsSnI3 film, resulting in decreased nonradiative recombination and enhanced charge extraction capacity. As illustrated in Fig. 6d, we could obtain the built-in potential (Vbi) through Mott–Schottky analysis. (4)where Na means the carrier concentration, V is the applied voltage, Kb represents the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.57 The other physical quantities have been described above. The Vbi of the DTS-treated device was estimated to be 0.37 V, larger than that of the pristine device (0.14 V), which is correlated with an improved VOC in the DTS-treated CsSnI3 solar cells. Typically, the Vbi values of Pb-based solar cells are around 1 V, much higher than those of Sn-based devices, which is mainly because the density of trap states in Pb-based solar cells is much lower than that in Sn-based solar cells. Therefore, seeking valid methods to reduce the defect density in CsSnI3 perovskite is helpful to enhance the driving force for charge separation and collection, and extend the depletion region for inhibiting carrier recombination, which is critical to solve the low VOC problem in CsSnI3 solar cells.58

Conclusions
In summary, we have rationally proposed a simple yet effective dual treatment strategy, combining the two-step temperature annealing process and surface cationic coordination to obtain high quality CsSnI3 perovskite films and decrease the defect density induced by surface undercoordinated Sn2+. This dual treatment strategy can not only maintain the dynamic balance between the grain growth and nucleation of the CsSnI3 films during film formation by using a staged annealing method, but also significantly reduces the deep level defect density through the strong coordination interaction between the introduced CPT and surface undercoordinated Sn2+, which also inhibits the nonradiative recombination and enhances the carrier lifetime. The DTS-treated CsSnI3 solar cell based on a printable c-TiO2/m-TiO2/Al2O3/NiO/carbon mesoporous framework achieves a PCE of 8.03% with high reproducibility and long-term stability, which is the champion efficiency among those reported for all-inorganic mesoporous CsSnI3 PSCs to date. This dual treatment strategy is expected to have obvious practical importance as a path to further realize high-performance fully inorganic CsSnI3 solar cells.
