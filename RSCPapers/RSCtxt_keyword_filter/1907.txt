    , Accepted 22nd May 2020First published on 25th May 2020AbstractConjugated copolymers PNP1–4 were prepared from the palladium catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of 2,7-dithienylphenanthrene units – bearing various alkoxy groups – PNM1–4 and 9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diboronic acid FBA. The formation of copolymers PNP1–4 was confirmed by different analytical techniques, such as, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), 1H- and 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), UV-vis absorption and emission spectroscopies. The target copolymers were found to have a relatively high thermal and chemical stability as well as an excellent solubility in common organic solvents. GPC traces of copolymers PNP1–4 display noticeably large weight-average (Mw) molecular weights in the range of 36.5–152.0 kDa and a polydispersity index (Đ = Mw/Mn) of 2.5–3.0. Photophysical analysis of PNP1–4 divulges their luminescence in the deep blue region, namely, in the range of 453–463 nm with an emission quantum yield up to 17%. In addition, copolymers PNP1–4 were explored as field-effect transistors revealing a hole mobility up to ∼6.4 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Introduction
The synthesis of new conjugated copolymers has surged in the past decade as a result of their eminence in optoelectronic applications, such as, field-effect transistors (FETs), photovoltaic cells (PVs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), electrochromic (EC) devices, as well as, chemical and biomedical sensors.1–8 Among conjugated copolymers, those synthesized from alternating various types of electron donor–acceptor (D–A) units have drawn a major interest because the careful selection of these latter unites offer several advantages, namely, the possibility of tuning the polymer's energy levels, and thus, alter its optoelectronic properties.9,10 Therefore, D–A conjugated copolymers have been extensively studied as electroactive materials in solar cells, field-effect transistors, and electrochromic devices revealing interesting properties, like, high power conversion efficiency (PCE), remarkable charge mobility, fast switching speed, facile color-tuning, and high optical contrasts.11–22
Nevertheless, many D–A copolymers reported in the literature suffer from a low chemical and physical stability, even under ambient conditions, whereas others reveal a diminished solubility in common organic solvents.23 Several reports have disclosed that the low stability could be circumvented by carefully choosing the donor and acceptor units to optimize the HOMO–LUMO energy levels, which could also lead to superior charge mobilities and PCE.24–30 On the other hand, the solubility of D–A copolymers can be enhanced by attaching alkyl chains,31–35 whose nature (e.g. straight or branched) and position were found to have a considerable effect on the crystal packing of the copolymer, and hence, its electronic properties.15,26,31,36–46
Among others, the electron donor building blocks that have been widely employed in the constructions of high-efficiency copolymers are fluorene, carbazole, silafluorene, benzodithiophene, and indacenodithiophene derivatives.1,47–53 Interestingly, phenanthrene is one of the most stable fused tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with a high resonance energy and a good planarity, and which has been examined as a possible candidate for optoelectronic applications.49,54,55 Furthermore, several reports have explored the synthesis of phenanthrene derivatives for optoelectronics.48,56–58
Herein, we describe the facile synthesis of four new 9,10-dialkoxyphenanthrene monomers bearing 2-bromothiophene derivatives at C-2 and C-7 positions (PNM1–4). The hitherto mentioned monomers were then reacted with 9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diboronic acid (FBA) under palladium-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura conditions affording the desired dialkoxyphenanthrene-based copolymers PNP1–4 in excellent yields.
Experimental
Material
All the reactions were carried out under inert atmosphere using dry argon. 11-(4-Iodobutyl)henicosane was purchased from Lyntech. All the other chemical reagents were used without further purification as purchased from Aldrich, Merck, and HiMedia unless otherwise specified. 2,7-Dibromophenanthrene-9,10-dione 1a, 2,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)phenanthrene-9,10-dione PQM1 2,7-bis(5-bromo-3-hexylthiophen-2-yl)phenanthrene-9,10-dione PQM2 was prepared according to a reported procedure.59,60 The solvents, namely, hexane, DCM, THF, toluene, and methanol were dried and deoxygenated by bubbling with argon gas for 30 minutes. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on aluminum sheets coated with silica gel 60 F254 and revealed using a UV lamp.
Instruments
NMR (1H: 600 MHz, 13C: 150 MHz) spectra were recorded on Bruker BioSpin GmbH 600 MHz spectrometer using CD2Cl2 as a solvent with the chemical shifts (δ) given in ppm and referred to tetramethylsilane (TMS). Electron impact high-resolution mass spectra (EI-HRMS) were recorded on a Thermo (DFS) with a standard PFK (perfluorokerosene) as lock mass. The analysed data is converted to accurate mass with the help of X-Calibur accurate mass calculation software. UV-Vis spectra were recorded on Shimadzu UV1800 spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded on an Agilent G9800 Cary Eclipse Fluorescence spectrophotometer. Agilent Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC/SEC) equipped with two columns (PL mixed-C) and calibrated against twelve monodisperse polystyrene (PS) standards, using THF as eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1, was employed to determine the relative weight-average (Mw), number-average (Mn) molecular weights, and polydispersity index (Đ = Mw/Mn) of all the reported polymers. FT-IR spectra were recorded on FT/IR-6300 type A instrument using a KBr matrix. Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) was recorded on Shimadzu TGA-60H (Kyoto, Japan) analyzer was used to measure the thermal stability of composites. TGA was carried out from room temperature to 800 °C. The heating rate was kept at 10 °C min−1 under inert atmosphere using pure nitrogen.
FET studies
Bottom-gate bottom-contact field-effect transistors were elaborated on commercial pre-patterned test structures. The lithographically defined source and drain contacts were composed of 30 nm thick gold on top of a 10 nm thick ITO layer and were deposited on top of an oxidized silicon wafer. The 230 nm thick silicon oxide was used as gate dielectric and the highly N-doped silicon substrate as gate electrode. The test structures were cleaned sequentially in acetone and isopropyl alcohol baths and in an ultra-violet ozone cleaner for 15 minutes. Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) was spin-coated under nitrogen atmosphere and annealed at 135 °C for 10 minutes. Finally, 5 mg mL−1 anhydrous chloroform or chlorobenzene polymer solutions were spin-coated to complete the OFET devices. The samples were left overnight under vacuum to remove residual solvent traces and were annealed at 150 °C for 30 minutes. Both the OFET elaboration and characterizations were performed in a nitrogen-filled glove box using a Keitley semiconductor system 4200.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of monomers PNM1–4

Scheme 1 shows the synthesis of monomers PNM1–4i.e. the derivatives of 9,10-dialkoxyphenanthrene doubly substituted at their C-2 and C-7 positions with either bromothiophene or 5-bromo-3-hexylthiophene groups. The building blocks were prepared from the in situ reduction of their corresponding 9,10-phenanthrenequinone synthons PQM1–259 with Na2S2O4, followed by a typical Williamson reaction using either 1-bromododecane or 11-(4-iodobutyl)henicosane. PNM1–4 were isolated in good yields and show excellent solubility in common organic solvents, like, dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, etc. It is noteworthy that the formation of the monomers was confirmed by 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, as well as, electron-impact high resolution mass spectrometry – EI-HRMS (see Fig. 1, 2 and Fig. S1–S4, S9–S12, S16–S18 in the ESI†).

The comparative 1H-NMR spectra of synthon PQM1 and its phenanthrene-9,10-dialkoxy product PNM1 clearly confirms the formation of the latter in high purity as it can be noticed from the presence of all the desired peaks (Fig. 1). The ten aromatic protons of PQM1 and PNM1 were detected in the range of ∼7.2–8.3 ppm and 7.1–8.4 ppm, respectively. The 1H-NMR spectrum of PQM1 doesn’t show any aliphatic peaks whereas PNM1 displays a peak at 4.23 ppm (t, 4H), which is attributed to the characteristic methylene hydrogens (–CH2– labeled “a” in Fig. 1) of the phenanthrene-9,10-dialkoxy group. In addition, all the aliphatic peaks in the range of ∼0.9–1.9 ppm are in full agreement with the desired target monomer PNM1. Similarly, 1H-NMR spectra of monomers PNM2–4 display the characteristic chemical shifts, and thus, confirm the formation of the desired monomers (see Fig. S2–S4 in the ESI†).
Electron-impact high resolution mass spectrometry (EI-HRMS) analysis of PNM1 confirm its formation, as revealed by the corresponding m/z peak. The high purity of the monomer could be noticed from the experimentally determined isotopic patterns that fully match the calculated ones (Fig. 2). It is worthwhile to mention that the mass spectra recorded for PNM2–4 corroborate the formation and purity of all the desired building blocks (see Fig. S16–S18 in the ESI†).
Synthesis of conjugated copolymers PNP1–4
As it could be noticed from Scheme 2, the conjugated copolymers PNP1–4 were made from the reaction of monomers PNM1–4 and the commercially available 9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diboronic acid (FBA) using typical palladium-catalyzed Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction conditions.59,60Table 1 summarizes the attempts carried out to optimize the polymerization reaction conditions. Synthesis of PNP1 was first tried by reacting 0.25 M PNM1 in a refluxing 1:1 toluene/water solvent mixture with an equimolar amount of FBA in presence of Pd2(dba)3 catalyst, SPhos ligand, and K2CO3 for four days. Despite the long reaction time, analysis of the reaction mixture by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and 1H-NMR spectroscopy revealed the presence of starting materials and oligomers along with short copolymer chains of the desired target PNP1 (Table 1, entry 1). Therefore, the concentration of the reactants was diluted to 0.10 M, in order to ensure a better solubility of the resulting oligomer intermediates, and which resulted in a slight improvement in the chain growth of PNP1, with an average number molecular mass Mn = 12.7 kDa and polydispersity Đ = 3.3 (Table 1, entry 2). Replacing toluene by higher boiling point solvents, like, xylene and chlorobenzene, decreased the reaction yield and afforded PNP1 with lower Mn and higher polydispersity values (Table 1, entries 3 and 4). It is worthwhile to mention that starting materials were detected in all the above-mentioned polymerization reaction attempts.

Interestingly, PNP1 was obtained in high purity simply by optimizing the concentration of PNM1 and FBA to 0.05 M, which resulted in polymer chains with an average number molecular mass of 13.0 kDa and Đ = 3.0 (Table 1, entry 5). Further dilution of the starting materials in the solvent mixture to 0.025 M lead to slight increase of Mn to 14.4 kDa but with a sharp increase in the polydispersity Đ = 4.0 (Table 1, entry 6). Hence, the optimal reaction conditions for the synthesis of polymer PNP1 were found to be best when using a 0.05 M concentration in 1:1 toluene/water, and thus, the same reaction conditions were applied to make PNP2–4 which afforded the desired copolymers with Mn ranging from 12.5 to 47.7 kDa and polydispersity values between 2.5 and 3.0 (Table 1, entries 7–9). It is worthwhile to mention that copolymers PNP1–4 were isolated in excellent yields (90–100%) and their high purity was confirmed by GPC analysis (Fig. 3), 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, TGA, FTIR, UV-vis absorption, and emission spectroscopies (see Fig. S5–S8, S13–S15 and S19–S22 in the ESI†).
 Fig. 3  Normalized GPC of PNP3. 
Comparative 1H-NMR spectra of the aromatic regions of PNM3 and PNP3 are shown in Fig. 4. The singlet peak at 7.06 ppm can be attributed to the thiophene aromatic proton (Fig. 4 up, label a) whereas chemical shifts at 7.68 ppm, 8.30 ppm, and 8.68 ppm are assigned to the phenanthrene aromatic protons (Fig. 4 up, labels b–d) of PNM3. Polymerization of this latter with FBA to make PNP3 resulted in shifting the aromatic protons of the thiophene units downfield at 7.44 ppm (Fig. 4 down, label a). Likewise, the chemical shifts that correspond to the protons of phenanthrene in PNP3 were also shifted downfield at 8.45 ppm and 8.75 ppm (Fig. 4 down, labels c and d). On the other hand, the peaks detected at 7.84–7.69 ppm are assigned to both the fluorene moiety (Fig. 4 down, label e) and two protons of the phenanthrene unit (Fig. 4 down, label b). Similarly, copolymers PNP1,2 and PNP4 display the characteristic proton chemical shifts which confirm their formation (see Fig. S5–S8 in the ESI†).

13C-NMR spectral analysis corroborates with the findings above, and thus, further confirms the formation of the target conjugated copolymers PNP1–4 by revealing the presence of all the peaks at the expected chemical shifts. Moreover, the ortho-dialkoxy groups in copolymers PNP1–4 were detected in the range of 73.7 ppm, which is characteristic of the aryl ether (C–O) chemical shifts (see Fig. S13–S15 in the ESI†).

Fig. 5 illustrates the FT-IR absorption spectra of copolymers PNP1–4, which all display C–H stretching and bending vibrations at ∼2925 cm−1 and 1461 cm−1, respectively. The phenanthrene units portray their characteristic C–O stretching vibrations at ∼1062 cm−1, whereas the thiophene moieties reveal their fingerprint C–S stretching vibrations at ∼791 cm−1. Fig. 6 depicts the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of polymers PNP1–4 showing relatively high 10% weight loss temperatures in the range of 342–353 °C. It should be noted that these values are ∼50 °C higher than the reported 10% weight loss temperature for similar copolymer derivatives reported earlier59 but bearing 9,10-phenanthaquinone units instead, which further confirms the superior stability brought about by introducing the phenanthrene units.

The photophysical properties of the target copolymers where measured by means of UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy (Fig. 7). PNP1–4 display similar features with a strong UV absorption band at 433 nm for PNP1,2 whereas the polymers containing hexylthiophene moiety PNP3,4 exhibit a 35 nm blue shift. Interestingly, the emission spectra of the copolymers portray a deep-blue luminescence peak maximum at 463 nm for PNP1,2 and 453 nm for PNP3,4. The fluorescence quantum yields of the target polymers were recorded in DCM using their respective UV-vis absorbance maxima as the excitation wavelengths, revealing values of 17% (PNP1), 13% (PNP2), 8.4% (PNP3) and 15% (PNP4).

The charge transport properties of copolymers PNP1–4 were tested by making bottom-gate bottom-contact organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). 5 mg mL−1 solutions of the target polymers in chlorobenzene were spin coated onto a 230 nm thick SiO2 dielectric film, which was previously coated with an HMDS monolayer (cf. Experimental part). Interesting, only the copolymers with unsubstituted thienyl groups i.e.PNP1,2 revealed semiconducting properties with a hole mobility of ∼6.4 ± 0.5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the former and ∼3.5 ± 0.6 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the latter (see Fig. 8 and Fig. S23, S24 in the ESI†). The lower hole mobility recorded for PNP2, when compared to PNP1, could be attributed to the steric hindrance of the branched chains, thus, preventing efficient packing between the neighboring polymers when deposited in thin films. The absence of any OFET properties for copolymers PNP3,4 could be explained by the presence of the hexyl groups on the thienyl units which provoke more twisting between the copolymer units, and consequently, hamper an efficient conjugation. This is further supported by the density functional computation carried out using B3LYP at the 6-31G* level basis set, which portrays dihedral angles between the thienyl group and the central phenanthrene unit for PNP1,2 in the range of 21–22°. Nevertheless, tilting between the thienyl moiety and the phenanthrene unit becomes more conspicuous when the former is decorated with a hexyl chain (PNP3,4), thus, revealing a greater dihedral angle of ∼41°, and consequently, thwarting an efficient conjugation (see Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI†). The more pronounced twisting between the adjacent units in PNP3,4 explains the hypochromic shift observed in their UV-Vis absorption.

Conclusion
Four new conjugated copolymers bearing alternating units of 2,7-dithienylphenanthrene-9,10-dialkoxy derivatives and 9,9-dioctylfluorene groups were successfully synthesized via a convenient Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction. The target copolymers PNP1–4 display a relatively high weight-average molecular weight (Mw) up to 152.0 kDa, with a polydispersity index (Đ = Mw/Mn) ranging from 2.5 to 3.0. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of PNP1–4 reveals a superior thermal stability with 10% weight loss temperatures in the range of 342–353 °C. The target conjugated copolymers reveal interesting photophysical properties by emitting in the deep blue (453–463 nm) with fluorescence quantum yields that reach a maximum of 17%. The charge transport properties of copolymers PNP1–4 were explored revealing a hole mobility in the range of 10−6–10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1.
