    , Accepted 22nd August 2017First published on 23rd August 2017AbstractPhotocatalytic overall water splitting using particulate semiconductors is a potential means of storing solar energy in using the intermittency of sunlight as a primary source of power and zero emission of carbon dioxide. Herein, we constructed a composite material with carbon dots (CDs) anchored on the surface of octahedral CoO as a highly efficient and long-term stable photocatalyst for overall water splitting under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm). The structure and morphology of the CDs/CoO composite were investigated by a series of characterization methods. The obtained CDs/CoO composites exhibit more-efficient visible light absorption than pure CoO, leading to higher photocatalytic activity for overall water splitting. The optimized photocatalytic H2 and O2 production was achieved for the CDs/CoO composite with a content of 5 wt% CDs (5% CDs/CoO), showing a H2 (O2) evolution rate of 1.67 μmol h−1 (0.91 μmol h−1) with an expected 2:1 stoichiometry, which is up to 6 times as high as that of pristine CoO. Additionally, the 5% CDs/CoO composite also shows outstanding photocatalytic stability for over 15 cycling experiments. This enhanced photocatalytic activity and outstanding stability in CDs/CoO composites could be ascribed to several merits of CDs that not only improved charge separation efficiency and visible-light absorption but also effectively conducted heat generated by the photo-thermal effect of CoO.
1. Introduction
The photocatalytic generation of hydrogen and oxygen from overall water splitting is a potentially scalable and economically feasible technology for converting solar energy into ideal clean fuels.1–5 Overall water splitting to H2 and O2 requires a high free energy of 113.38 kcal mol−1.6 The O2 release involves an ideally direct four-electron or two stepwise two-electron processes, which limits the number of reliable, reproducible photocatalysts.7 To date, several photocatalysts have been reported to decompose water into H2 and O2 under UV-light (∼4% of solar spectrum); thus, their inherent drawbacks in photocatalysis result in the low solar energy utilization efficiency.8–12 In view of utilizing sunlight efficiently, the development of visible-light-responsive photocatalysts for overall water splitting is indispensable.
Recently, CoO has been given broad attention since Bao et al. reported nanocrystalline CoO for overall water splitting with an extraordinary STH of around 5%.13 Very recently, our group synthesized the sub-micrometer CoO octahedron photocatalyst with an exposed (111) facet not only showing visible-light photocatalytic activity for overall water splitting but also possessing outstanding resistance to H2O2 poisoning.14 Nevertheless, the CoO octahedron photocatalyst gradually deactivated after six cycles (about 144 h). This phenomenon mainly originated from the unintended thermo-induced effect during the photocatalysis to accelerate CoO phase transformation due to the alternation between Co2+ cations and O2− anions from one plane to another and ultimately attained Co3O4. In light of the above reasons for deactivation of CoO, searching for an ideal material to couple with CoO, further improving the photocatalytic activity and stability, is still highly desired. It is noteworthy that this suitable material should have at least the following specifications: (i) containing more oxygen functional groups in coordination with Co2+ in the CoO to avoid the rapid phase transformation; (ii) further enhancement of the visible-light absorption and promotion of electron transfer; (iii) the excellent thermal conductivity protecting CoO from the deactivation during the photocatalytic process.
Carbon dots (CDs, less than 10 nm in diameter) possess abundant hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the surface, which can be utilized as a multifunctional component in the photocatalyst design. Previous studies have reported that CDs could provide a convenient way to couple with metal oxides to form metal–O–C bonds based on interfacial interactions.15,16 Meanwhile, CDs possess photo-generated electron transfer properties which have been proved to availably improve interfacial charge separation and increase visible-light absorption in CD-containing composite photocatalysts, such as CDs/g-C3N4,7 CDs/BiVO4 QDs and CDs/Ag/Ag3PW12O40.17,18 Additionally, owing to the fact that CDs come from graphitic structure fragments, it also displays favourable thermal conductivity, which is beneficial to the heat dissipation of CoO during the photocatalytic reaction process. Therefore, we attempt to combine CDs with CoO to construct a highly effective and long-term stable composite in the photocatalytic system.
In this work, CDs/CoO composite photocatalysts were fabricated by a one-step solvothermal method for overall water splitting under visible light irradiation without any cocatalysts or sacrificial agents. Notably, the CDs/CoO composite with the content of CDs reaching 5 wt% (5% CDs/CoO) shows the highest photocatalytic activity with a 2:1 stoichiometric ratio of H2 evolution rate of 1.67 μmol h−1 and O2 evolution rate of about 0.91 μmol h−1, which is around 6 times higher than that of pure CoO. Additionally, the 5% CDs/CoO composite also exhibits outstanding photocatalytic stability (over 15 recycles). This enhanced photocatalytic activity and outstanding stability in CDs/CoO composites could be ascribed to several merits of CDs that not only improved charge separation efficiency and visible-light absorption but also effectively conducted heat generated by the photo-thermal effect of CoO.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of CDs/CoO composites
The CD solution was prepared through the typical electrochemical method according to our previous report.19 Briefly, two graphite rods were inserted into ultrapure water serving as an anode and a cathode, and a bias of 30 V was applied between two electrodes using a direct current power supply. After continuous stirring for 5 days, a dark yellow solution was formed in the reaction cell. Then, the dark yellow solution was filtered and freeze-dried into powder. Afterwards, the prepared CD solution was treated in a freeze-drying way to obtain the CD solid powders. CDs/CoO composites with different mass ratios of CDs (1 wt%, 3 wt%, 5 wt%, 10 wt% and 20 wt%) were prepared using the following procedure: 1.84 g Co(CH3COO)2·4H2O and different mass ratios of CDs (0.00552, 0.01656, 0.0276, 0.0552 and 0.1104 g) were added to a mixed solvent containing 64 mL n-octanol and 16 mL ethanol with vigorous stirring for 2 h. The resulted slurry was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and then heated at 220 °C for 4 h. The formed powders were washed with ethanol three times and finally dried at 70 °C in an oven. The resulting products were abbreviated as 1% CDs/CoO, 3% CDs/CoO, 5% CDs/CoO, 10% CDs/CoO and 20% CDs/CoO. The pristine CoO sample was fabricated under the same conditions in the absence of CDs.
2.2. Photocatalytic experiments
For photocatalytic reactions, 50 mg of photocatalyst, 20 mL of ultrapure water and a stir bar were put into a photoreactor vial with a total volume of 50 mL. Afterwards, the system was degassed to completely remove air (including dissolved air). Under constant stirring, a white light-emitting diode (LED) was used as the visible light source (λ > 400 nm), and the spectrum of the LED light source is shown in Fig. S1.† An online GC-7900 gas chromatograph (GC) setup with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and 5 Å molecular sieve columns was employed for evolved gas detection. The temperatures of the oven, injection port and detector in GC were maintained at 80, 100 and 120 °C, respectively. Ar was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1. For reproducibility and stability tests of the photocatalysts, the suspension after the reaction was centrifuged and reused for repeated tests. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420 nm was estimated under a 300 W xenon lamp equipped with a band pass filter (see the ESI†).
2.3. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation test
The formation of H2O2 in the photocatalytic reaction system was detected by UV-vis spectroscopy using o-tolidine as the peroxide indicator. 2 mL of the reaction supernatant was collected after centrifugation, and then 0.5 mL of 1% o-tolidine in 0.1 M HCl solution was added to it. After about 2 min, the dispersion was further acidified with 2 mL of 1 M HCl, which caused the colour change to yellow. The concentration of H2O2 was then obtained by measuring the absorbance of the yellow product at a characteristic peak wavelength of 436 nm.
2.4. Heat-treatment of photocatalysts
In a typical synthesis run, 50 mg of the as-prepared photocatalysts was dispersed in 20 mL ultrapure water with further transfer into a 50 mL vial (the same one for the photocatalytic reaction). Then, the suspension was treated by heating for 6 h under various temperatures (40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 °C) under air atmosphere.
2.5. Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded using an X'Pert-ProMPD (Holland) D/max-γA X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154178 nm). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained by using a Nicolet 360 spectrometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) were performed with a FEI-Tecnai F20 microscope operating at 200 kV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained with a FEI-quanta 200 microscope with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a KRATOS Axis ultra-DLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a monochromatised Al Kα X-ray source. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface areas and pore structures were characterized by using a Micromeritics ASAP-2050 porosimeter. Room temperature UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Lambda 750 (Perkin Elmer) spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200–800 nm. Raman spectra were performed on an HR 800 Raman spectroscope (J Y, France) equipped with a synapse CCD detector, a confocal Olympus microscope and a 633 nm He–Ne laser for excitation. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed using an unfiltered He I (21.22 eV) gas discharge lamp and a total instrumental energy resolution of 100 meV. Photoluminescence (PL) study was recorded on a Fluorolog-TCSPC luminescence spectrometer. Electrochemical analysis was conducted on a CHI 660b workstation. The Pt wire, a calomel electrode, and the samples were used as the counter electrode, the reference electrode, and the working electrode, respectively, in a three-electrode cell. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was recorded by using an alternating voltage of 5 mV amplitude in the frequency range of 105 Hz to 10−2 Hz with the open circuit voltage in 0.5 M Na2SO4. For transient photocurrent response, a 300 W Xe lamp (cutting off λ < 420 nm) and Na2SO4 (0.5 M) were employed as the light source and electrolyte, respectively.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a displays the XRD patterns of the as-prepared CoO and 5% CDs/CoO composite. All the diffraction peaks can be assigned to the face-centred cubic CoO structure (JCPDS 71-1178). Simultaneously, the result reveals that the addition of CDs in the CDs/CoO composite has no influence on the phase structure of CoO. However, the extra characteristic peak of carbon at 26° is hardly found when the amounts of CDs are 1%, 3%, 5% and 10% in the CDs/CoO composites (Fig. S2†), which can be mainly resulted from the relatively limited amount of CDs,20 while in the case of 20% CDs/CoO, a broadened peak, although not very obvious, can be observed (purple trace, Fig. S2†) at around 26° belonging to CDs. To characterize the surface groups on the as-prepared samples, FT-IR spectra were carried out and are presented in Fig. S3.† For CoO (black line), two main bands located at around 420 cm−1 and 3430 cm−1 are the stretching vibration of Co–O bonds and –OH stretching deformation, respectively; note here that the –OH may come from the adsorbed water.21 In the FI-TR spectrum of CDs (blue line), the peaks at 1403 cm−1, 1634 cm−1 and 3433 cm−1 are attributable to the stretching vibration modes of CC, CO, and O–H, respectively, indicating a large number of carbonyl, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups on the surface of CDs.22 With respect to the 5% CDs/CoO composite (red line), the characteristic vibration modes of CDs and CoO can be easily found, confirming the existence of CDs in the CDs/CoO composite. The Raman spectra of the CDs, CoO, and 5% CDs/CoO composite are illustrated in Fig. 1b, where the peaks located at 1335 cm−1 and 1607 cm−1 are observed for CD spectrum (blue trace), corresponding to the D-band and G-band of carbon, respectively.23 From CoO (blank trace), it is observed that the characteristic peaks (Eg: 489 cm−1, T2g: 540 cm−1, A1g: 690 cm−1) are in good agreement with the face-centred cubic structure of CoO.24 The Raman spectrum of the 5% CDs/CoO composite shows a combination of prominent peaks of both CDs and CoO, further confirming the composite structure.

The morphology and crystal structure of the CDs, CoO and CDs/CoO composite were explored by TEM and HRTEM. As shown in Fig. S4a,† the synthesized CDs exhibit fine dispersity and the average particle sizes of CDs are in diameters of 2–8 nm (inset of Fig. S4a†). The HRTEM image of a single CD particle (Fig. S4b†) displays the crystal lattice spacing of approximately 0.21 nm, which agrees well with the (100) lattice planes of graphitic carbon.25 Fig. S5a† shows the SEM image of the synthesized pure CoO, presenting a nearly uniform octahedral morphology with an average diameter of around 200–500 nm. After the introduction of CDs, the CDs/CoO composite has a similar octahedral structure, which indicates that the introduction of CDs makes no change to the main morphology and size of CoO (Fig. S5b† and 2a). In order to ascertain the existence of CDs, the HRTEM image of CDs/CoO is shown in Fig. 2b, from which it can be observed that some CDs are attached on the CoO surface, and the lattice spacings of CoO and CDs are determined to be 0.25 and 0.21 nm, which are in line with the (111) crystal plane of CoO and the (100) crystal plane of CDs, respectively.17,26 To further investigate the microstructure and composition of the CDs/CoO composite, HAADF-STEM and elemental scanning analysis were performed. Based on the STEM image (Fig. 2c), the EDX mappings of C, Co and O elements in the same region are detected as shown in Fig. 2d. The above results provide solid evidence that CDs/CoO composites were successfully synthesized.

XPS spectra were recorded to further analyze the surface chemical compositions and chemical states of the CDs/CoO composite. In Fig. 3a, the XPS survey spectrum of 5% CDs/CoO is presented, demonstrating that C, Co, O and indium (In) are the main elements in the sample. It is notable that indium (In) element comes from the substrate. The high-resolution spectra of C 1s, Co 2p and O 1s are shown in Fig. 3b–d. The C 1s shown in Fig. 3b can be deconvoluted into three component peaks with binding energies at about 284.6, 285.5 and 288.1 eV, which are ascribed to C–C, C–O and CO bonds, respectively.27 In Fig. 3c, the Co 2p spectrum displays two typical peaks located at 780.7 and 796.6 eV with another two relatively obvious satellite peaks at 786.0 eV and 802.7 eV, which corresponds to the Co2+ in CoO.13 Meanwhile, O 1s peaks (Fig. 3d) centred at 529.5, 531.7 eV and 533.1 eV can be assigned to the lattice oxygen in the Co–O, Co–O–C and C–O bonds, respectively,16,28,29 implying that a strong interaction exists between CDs and CoO.

The optical properties of CoO and 5% CDs/CoO were examined by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and are shown in Fig. 4a. With regard to CoO (black trace), it evidently shows a strong absorption in a wide range, which is in agreement with the previous report.30 Significantly, when combining CoO with CDs, the colour of powders changed from yellowish-brown into dark brown (insets of Fig. 4a), and the CDs/CoO composite exhibits a stronger visible light absorption nearly in the range of 490–800 nm, which indicates that CDs to some extent enhance visible-light harvesting. Furthermore, according to the Kubelka–Munk function, the bandgap energies of CoO and CDs/CoO photocatalysts are 2.51 and 2.42 eV, respectively (Fig. 4b). The bandgap of CDs/CoO is slightly lower than that of CoO, which is more beneficial for harvesting more solar energy and generating more electron–hole pairs. The ultraviolet photo-electron spectroscopy (UPS) spectrum of CDs/CoO is presented in Fig. 4c, which is calculated to determine the ionization potential [equal to the valence band energy (EVB)]. Based on the linear intersection method,7 the maximum valence band (VB) of 5% CDs/CoO is calculated to be 6.83 eV, by subtracting the width of the He I UPS spectrum from the excitation energy (21.22 eV). Therefore, the conduction band of CDs/CoO is calculated at 4.41 eV from EVB − Eg, which is equal to −0.03 volts (V) versus the RHE (the reversible hydrogen electrode) after converting to electrochemical energy potentials in V, where 0 V versus the RHE is equal to −4.44 eV versus the vacuum level. Consequently, Fig. 4d presents the energy level diagram of 5% CDs/CoO compared to the potentials of water reduction and oxidation. It is manifested that 5% CDs/CoO with appropriate energy level positions can theoretically realize the water photo-splitting into H2, O2, and H2O2.

The photocatalytic overall water splitting reactions over the as-prepared samples were evaluated under visible-light irradiation (λ > 400 nm) without the aid of applied bias potential or any sacrificial agents. In Fig. 5a and b, no H2 and O2 can be detected when the system is kept in the dark. Moreover, we have also tested the H2/O2 evolutions from pure water without any catalysts under visible light irradiation (Fig. S6†). It can be seen that no gas was obtained which implies that H2/O2 generation is a light catalyzed reaction only in the presence of the catalysts. Notably, when the system is irradiated, both CoO and 5% CDs/CoO photocatalysts can overall split water into H2 and O2 in an approximate 2:1 molar ratio. More strikingly, the optimized CDs/CoO composite (1.67 μmol h−1) demonstrates about six-times higher photocatalytic-H2 production rates in comparison with pristine CoO (0.27 μmol h−1), indicating that CDs play a vital role in this complex photocatalytic system. Besides, the photocatalytic activities of CDs/CoO with different contents of CDs were investigated, as shown in Fig. 5c, where the photocatalytic activity of CDs/CoO composite exhibits a great dependence on the loading amount of CDs. The optimized photocatalytic H2 and O2 production is achieved for the CDs/CoO composite with a content of 5 wt% CDs (5% CDs/CoO), manifesting the highest photocatalytic performance. A further increase in the amount of CDs results in a decrease of activity. There are two reasons which may explain this reduction of activity: (i) redundant CDs could cover the active sites on the surface of CoO; (ii) overmuch CDs may adversely turn into a recombination center of photo-induced charges which could reduce the utilization of incident light.31 Again, the stability of 5% CDs/CoO was evaluated through recycling experiment under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 5d, the hydrogen generation rate of 5% CDs/CoO shows no apparent decrease after fifteen recycling tests, implying that the CDs/CoO composite is a quite stable photocatalyst. Next, we explored the optimum H2 evolution through adding the 5% CDs/CoO catalyst with different amounts into 20 mL pure water (Fig. S7a†). It is worth mentioning that with increasing the amount of the catalyst, the H2 evolution rate also increased. When the amount increased to 10 mg in the 20 mL pure water (catalyst/water = 0.5), the 5% CDs/CoO catalyst showed the highest photocatalytic activity with a H2 evolution rate of 1.69 μmol h−1, and then stayed almost at a similar H2 evolution rate upon further addition. In addition, we tested the total H2/O2 production from pure water with the 5% CDs/CoO composite under different accumulated times (Fig. S7b†). It should be notable that the yields of H2 and O2 increase linearly over irradiation time. The total amount of gaseous O2 collected reached 216 μmol after 10 days, which corresponded to a turnover number (TON) of 3.4, signifying that the origin of H2/O2 production should be from photocatalytic overall water splitting instead of the decomposition of CDs/CoO composites. Fig. S8a and b† show the H2/O2 evolutions from pure water over 5% CDs/CoO under visible light irradiation (λ = 420 ± 20 nm) and corresponding apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) values under different irradiation times. It is demonstrated that the H2/O2 evolutions exhibit good linear relationships and corresponding AQE values are basically unchanged under different irradiation times. Table S1† shows the comparative survey of the photocatalytic-hydrogen-production AQE of representative CD-based photocatalysts, which suggests that the 5% CDs/CoO photocatalyst possesses a relatively high AQE of 1.02% at 420 nm (Fig. S9†) for water splitting without a co-catalyst or sacrificial agent and was monitored using an on-line gas chromatograph (Fig. S10†).

(d) The stability of photocatalytic water splitting over 5% CDs/CoO. The photocatalytic reactions were performed with 50 mg of photocatalyst dispersed in 20 mL of ultrapure water under visible-light irradiation (λ > 400 nm). 
To investigate the origin of enhanced photocatalytic activity of CDs/CoO, multiple techniques were carried out as follows in Fig. 6. Fig. 6a illustrates the specific surface area and pore volume of CoO and 5% CD/CoO samples. As expected, the CDs/CoO composite photocatalyst has a larger specific surface area (4.85 m2 g−1) than pure CoO (0.53 m2 g−1), suggesting that a larger specific surface area of the hybrid photocatalyst favours the enhanced photocatalytic activity benefiting from more surface active sites.32 Photoluminescence (PL) analysis was used to provide very useful information to reveal the migration, transfer and separation efficiency of the photoexcited charge carriers in a photocatalytic material because the PL emission of the photocatalyst mainly stems from the charge carrier recombination.33 Generally, the PL intensity is directly proportional to the electron–hole recombination probability, and lower PL intensity indicates the increase in the effective separation rate of charges. It can be seen in Fig. 6b that CoO shows weaker PL intensity than that of CDs/CoO (both at an excitation wavelength of 325 nm), indicating more efficient interfacial electron transfer from CoO to CDs in the CDs/CoO complex photocatalytic system. The electrochemical experiment was conducted to further investigate the photo-induced charge transfer and separation behaviours. Fig. 6c shows the measured transient photocurrents of CoO and CDs/CoO with four light-on and light-off cycles at an open circuit potential. It is obtained that 5% CDs/CoO shows enhanced photocurrent intensity compared with CoO, confirming an increased charge separation rate of the CDs/CoO composite. Additionally, the interfacial charge transfer of CoO and 5% CDs/CoO electrodes is investigated by electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). In general, the arc radius is relevant to the charge-transfer resistance and a smaller radius means a lower charge transfer resistance.34 In comparison with CoO, the typical EIS Nyquist plots of 5% CDs/CoO indicate a smaller arc radius, suggesting a lower interfacial charge-transfer resistance. These results from PL, transient photocurrent response and EIS are entirely consistent, which prove that combining CDs with CoO could effectively facilitate faster photo-induced charge transfer and separation, leading to a greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity in the CDs/CoO composite. Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that the charge separation efficiency of octahedral CoO has been enhanced after anchoring CDs on the surface.

The possible factors determining the high stability of the CDs/CoO composite were probed for a more profound understanding of the composite photocatalyst. In our previous report, we have affirmed the fact that the deactivation of CoO is strongly related to increased temperature, especially for the photo-thermal effect during the photocatalysis.14 Thus, the variations of H2 productions (in 24 hours) from water over the CoO octahedrons and the 5% CDs/CoO composite by heat treatment from 25 °C to 80 °C were measured (Fig. 7a). In detail, when the temperature increased to 70 °C, the H2 evolution can be hardly detected for pristine CoO, indicating a complete deactivation (100% loss of the H2 production). Fig. S11a† shows the XRD patterns of pristine CoO before and after photocatalysis experiments. All the XRD peaks of used CoO become apparently weaker compared to those of the fresh one. Moreover, two characteristic XPS satellite peaks at 786.0 and 802.7 eV and the Raman peak at 540 cm−1 of CoO all decrease dramatically after irradiation (Fig. S11b and c†), which imply the gradual deactivation of the CoO octahedron catalyst. The HRTEM image (Fig. S11d†) shows two distinct lattice spacings with 0.25 nm for the (111) plane of CoO and 0.28 nm for the (220) plane of Co3O4, thus solidly demonstrating the formation of the Co3O4 in the marginal area of surfaces of the CoO octahedron after the irradiation. As a comparison, the H2 evolution amount of the 5% CDs/CoO composite only decreases from 40 to 25 μmol even though the temperature rose to 80 °C (only 37% decrease of the H2 production), demonstrating that the heat conducting properties of CDs make CoO possess outstanding tolerance to the high temperature by avoiding local overheating. According to the band structure diagram discussed previously, 5% CDs/CoO can theoretically split water through a four-electron or stepwise 2e−/2e− two-electron pathway. For the sake of studying the mechanism of 5% CDs/CoO, the production of H2O2 in the reaction solution using CoO and 5% CDs/CoO as photocatalysts was reflected by using the UV-vis absorption spectra in Fig. 7b, where H2O2 can be detected in both systems, identifying that both CoO and 5% CDs/CoO split water using a stepwise 2e−/2e− two-electron pathway. H2O2 accumulation is normally considered to poison many catalysts; therefore, it is necessary to investigate whether the produced H2O2 will bring about a negative effect on the CDs/CoO composite photocatalytic system, as well as the decomposition efficiency of H2O2. Fig. S12† depicts the LSV curves of CDs, CoO and 5% CDs/CoO in 20 mM H2O2 solution. It can be found that the current density of CoO is highest compared to CDs and 5% CDs/CoO at the same potential, implying that CoO has excellent ability to decompose H2O2. Fig. 7c further evaluated O2 evolution from H2O2 decomposition using CoO, 5% CDs/CoO and CDs catalysts as a function of reaction time under dark, where O2 evolution rates are 0.72, 0.47, and 0.23 μmol min−1 for CoO, 5% CDs/CoO and CDs, respectively; hence, CoO possesses the strongest ability for the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 and H2O. For a deep insight of the dynamic process of production of H2O2 during the reaction, the i–t curves of CoO and 5% CDs/CoO as catalysts under illumination are shown in Fig. 7d, where the current oscillations are caused by the cycles of H2O2 generation, adsorption, decomposition by catalysts and diffusion, thus demonstrating why 5% CDs/CoO and CoO catalysts are not poisoned by H2O2 and exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity.

(b) UV-vis absorption spectra of H2O2 in the reaction solution with CoO and 5% CDs/CoO as catalysts after 24 h light irradiation. (c) O2 evolution from H2O2 (10 mM) decomposition versus time curves using CoO and 5% CDs/CoO as catalysts under dark. (d) The i–t curves of CoO and 5% CDs/CoO under illumination. 
On the basis of the above analyses, a feasible photocatalytic mechanism for overall water splitting under visible light irradiation by the CDs/CoO photocatalyst was proposed as shown in Fig. 8. Under visible light irradiation, the photo-excited electrons and holes are simultaneously generated in the CDs/CoO composite, of which the photo-induced electrons transfer from the valence band to the conduction band and the holes remain in the valence band of CoO to combine with H2O to produce H2O2/O2. Due to the electron transfer properties of CDs, the photo-induced electrons in the CB of CoO are shuttled freely to the CDs for H2 evolution, suppressing the recombination of electron–hole pairs and further improving the photocatalytic activity of CoO. Moreover, due to the photo-thermal effect in the photocatalytic reaction, CDs as a heat conductor could timely remove the surface heating of CoO, which makes CoO avoid deactivation.

4. Conclusions
We have synthesized CDs/CoO composite photocatalysts through a one-pot solvothermal method for overall water splitting under visible-light irradiation. Various characterizations demonstrated that CDs were intimately anchored on the surface of octahedral CoO to form CDs/CoO composites. Highly effective overall water splitting can be achieved by CDs/CoO composites. And when the content of CDs reached 5 wt%, the 5% CDs/CoO composite exhibits the highest photocatalytic H2 production activity (1.67 μmol h−1), which is nearly six times higher than that of pristine CoO (0.27 μmol h−1). The enhanced photocatalytic activity can be attributed to the reasons that the electron transfer properties of CDs could effectively suppress charge-carrier recombination. Meanwhile, the outstanding photocatalytic stability of CoO results from CDs as a heat conductor to transfer unintended heat from CoO during the photocatalytic reaction. This work may provide a new thought of designing the photocatalyst with high efficiency and stability for energy conversion.
