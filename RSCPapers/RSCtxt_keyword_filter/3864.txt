1 Introduction
With the growth of the economy and the improvement of lifestyle, global energy demand is increasing rapidly.1,2 Compared with traditional energy (e.g., fuels and coals), renewable sources are adopted in alternative energy technologies, including solar, wind, and tidal energy.2–15 To maximize the utilization of clean and renewable energies, many initiatives have been taken toward energy storage technologies.2,13,14,16–18 Among them, lithium-ion batteries serve as the most efficient way of applying these clean energy sources to daily consumption, which can decrease the usage of fossil fuels and can be beneficial to the environment.2,4,5,12–14,19–23 Meanwhile, this battery technology has promising prospects, especially in the fields of notebook computers and vehicles, because of its 350 W h kg−1 energy density and suitable operating voltage range. As a case in point, the Tesla company offers a Li-ion-based plug-in electric car (Model 3) with an all-electric range of 400–500 km and an energy density of 60–80 kW h. According to the lithium-ion battery factory assessment launched in 2021, the recent global cell manufacturing for electrical vehicles target is set to grow to 2492 G W h in 2025.24,25 However, current commercial electrode materials (lithium iron phosphate, lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides, etc.) are reaching theoretical limitations of capacity and are still far from the increased energy density demand.26–30
Researchers are increasingly giving more importance to sulfur (S8) cathode-based lithium-ion (Li–S) batteries due to their high capacity (1672 mA h g−1), suitable energy density (2600 W h kg−1), and better potential range (1.5–3.0 V versus lithium) for high-capacity electrode materials.31–34 In addition, the environmentally friendly sulfur element has rich resources on Earth, leading to a relatively lower cost (∼150 USD per ton) than raw cathode materials (∼3300 USD per ton of cobalt) in Li-ion batteries.15,24,29,35,36 Unfortunately, Li-ion batteries use a pure S8 cathode and a highly hazardous lithium piece as the anode electrode. In manufacturing processes, the continuous plating and stripping behavior of pure lithium metal can cause formation of the dendritic and mossy Li surface and further puncture separators of the cell, generating serious safety issues.17,37–43
To solve this problem,13 the Li2S material represents a better candidate for using as a promising lithium-containing cathode electrode in lithium-ion batteries, where Li-ions are already incorporated into the Li2S structure. Li2S can pair with a lithium-free anode (such as silicon, graphene, copper, and graphite) to assemble a full battery with high performance,14 which will avoid lithium dendrite issues. More crucially, Li2S has a high electrochemical capacity (1166 mA h g−1), which is greater than the theoretical electrochemical capacity of existing commercial cathode materials.20,33,44,45 Furthermore, the Li2S cathode can minimize volume expansion (it has a lower density of 1.66 g cm−3 than sulfur, which has a density of 2.07 g cm−3), resulting in a more stable electrode structure. Meanwhile, Li2S has a greater melting point (938 °C) than S8 (115 °C), which might broaden the application field of Li–S batteries, including robotics in firefighting, spacecraft, and electronic equipment in high-temperature environments. Benefiting from these excellent characteristics, Li2S materials will be deemed to be an alternative electrode for Li–S batteries (Fig. 1).4–6,46,47
 Fig. 1  Illustration of the Li–S cell industries. The cell is produced by abundant sulfur resources with industrial production and powered by renewable energy technologies such as solar, wind, geothermal, and nuclear technologies. In this way, high-performance batteries are applied in various fields, such as electronic equipment, transportation, and space exploration. 
Unfortunately, Li2S cathodes also have certain application problems, such as LiS being mainly an electrochemically inactive material and requiring a high activated potential barrier in the first-time cell charging. More specifically, Li2S is an inorganic deliquescent ionic compound with a face-centered cubic (fcc) anti-fluorite (anti-CaF2) crystal structure and space group Fmm.3 In this structure, each Li+ cation is surrounded by four S2− anions inside the structure, and the corresponding S2− anion has a coordination number of eight with Li+ cations, resulting in enormous voids in the crystal structure and high solubility in polar solvents.
As a result, the bulk Li2S material shows mostly inert electrochemical reactions, and it requires activation at a high charging potential.3,20,48–53 In 2012, the Yang team reported that a high charging potential of 4.0 V was used to overcome the voltage barrier of the Li2S cathode, achieving an attractive capacity of 800 mA h g−1, whereas the normal cutoff charge potential of Li–S batteries (3.0 V) cannot make the Li2S-based cell work.39 Worse still, electrolyte decomposition-based side reactions can cause poor cycle stability and low energy efficiency after charging at 4.0 V.54–57 For the high activation voltage, the Yang team also revealed that the activation process of Li2S implies a two-phase reaction (solid–liquid) during the first charging behavior, and the high activation barrier is related to phase nucleation.39 More specifically, polysulfides do not nucleate until the voltage reaches the top of the activation barrier because of the higher formation enthalpy of Li2S. In addition, Kang et al.40 showed that increasing the contact area between soluble polysulfides and solid Li2S can effectively improve battery performance. Therefore, directly applying preliquid Li2S as cathodes can enhance the performance of batteries, which greatly increases the contact areas between Li2S and the functional materials. Therefore, the electrons and Li ions become more easily transported, making it easier to convert Li2S to polysulfides, thereby reducing the barrier to Li2S activation. Subsequently, Chiang et al.4 proposed that the morphology and particle size can also affect the activation process of Li2S particles. Decreasing the particle size of Li2S can lead to a reduced activation barrier, better utilization of Li2S, and improved performance. For example, high-energy ball milling is applied to lower the activation energy barrier and boost battery performance.58,59 More specifically, Kang et al. showed that dissolved long-chain lithium polysulfides can improve the charge transfer for solid Li2S, resulting in the removal of the large potential barrier after surficial solid Li2S electrochemically oxidizes into liquid and soluble lithium polysulfides.40 They proposed that increasing the contact area between soluble polysulfides and solid Li2S can significantly boost the performance of Li2S-based cells. Moreover, the Chiang team showed that regulating the morphology of electrodeposited Li2S by controlling the nucleation density and rates can minimize the overpotential.4 Benefitting from the regulated size of Li2S particles,58 some research groups aim to reduce the initial activation potential by the ultrahigh-speed ball milling approach, which increases the contact surface of each electrode material, shortens Li+ diffusion, and enhances Li2S reactivity.60–62 However, the ultrahigh-speed ball milling approach not only brings about security problems, a low output rate, and high cost, but also the produced reaction interface of the electrode remains in solid–solid contact. As a better choice, the presolvation approach of Li2S has received much interest since it is a simple way to change the contact interface of solid–solid into a better contacting area of the solid–liquid state. Most importantly, this facile loading method of liquid Li2S can provide a new opportunity to construct a commercially viable assembly for industrial batteries. However, Li2S cathodes share a similar set of drawbacks as the S8 material, including the “shuttle” effect and low electric/ionic conductivity. The challenge of the “shuttle” effect is the notorious self-diffusion behavior of polysulfides. In cell running, intermediate products of polysulfides can get away from the cathode to the anode by the concentration gradient in the liquid electrolytes, resulting in the loss of active materials and poor cycling stability. Currently, people are interested in lowering the activation potential of Li2S and restraining the “shuttle” effect of polysulfides.
Hence, we review the emerging advances in tailoring of the reaction interface by the presolvation of bulk Li2S to enhance the electrochemical performance of devices. Meanwhile, this facile loading method of Li2S solution will be a critical step in commercializing Li–S cell applications. First, we start with a discussion about the presolvation of Li2S with their outstanding advantages based on the high performance of batteries. Then, we overview different types of main kinds of functional materials (carbon materials, metal sulfides, oxides, phosphides, and organic compounds) with emphasis on their interface properties in preliquid Li2S batteries (Fig. 2a). Finally, we summarize existing opportunities and provide a brief perspective about the presolvation strategies of Li2S in potential commercial applications.

2 The presolvation of Li2S
Generally, random accumulations (Fig. 2b) of Li2S particles have limited contact to generate a solid–solid interface with the functional material with slower reaction kinetics, resulting in polysulfide migration. Worse still, partial Li2S cannot come into contact with the electrolyte or/and electrode, which is an intermediate location of the cathode, making the electrochemical process difficult to complete. Following the presolvation treatment, the bulk Li2S particles are transformed into liquid Li2S, allowing the solid–solid contact to be transformed into the solid–liquid contact. As a result, the reaction kinetics and electron/ion transfer are considerably enhanced, and the redox overpotential is reduced, which also lowers the barrier in Li2S activation and polysulfide conversion processing.
The tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) solvent and phosphorus pentasulfide (P2S5) materials are used to solvate the bulk Li2S (Fig. 3a). Liang's team reported that the P2S5-TEGDME system can accelerate the dissolution of bulk Li2S,63 promote the reaction kinetics of Li2S, and optimize the lithium metal surface to suppress the shuttle effect of polysulfides. A P2S5-based Li2S cell demonstrates a better reversible capacity (approximately 1300 mA h g−1), retaining the stabilized performance (900 mA h g−1) of the Li–S cell with 40 cycles (approximately 98% coulombic efficiency) at 0.1C (Fig. 3b and c). Zu et al. further demonstrated that this method can help reduce the activation potential to 2.4 V.64

To further improve the dissolution of Li2S, G. Yushin's group discovered that ethanol solution can dissolve bulk Li2S (Fig. 3d), and the nanostructured Li2S-based multiwalled carbon nanotube (20 wt% MWCNT) cathodes obtained by such a presolvation strategy retain 90% of the reversible electrochemical capacity with 100 cycles of Li–S cells (bulk Li2S-based cells retain only 85%) in a 7 M electrolyte (Fig. 3e).65 Additionally, Xiang et al. further demonstrated that trace ethanol can partly dissolve Li2S66 and decrease the activation barrier of Li2S cathodes by adding ethanol into the solvents of dimethoxyethane (DME) and 1,3-dioxolane (DOL), leading to the small particle size of Li2S (approximately 1 μm) by modification with trace ethanol. The Li–S cell with 500 ppm ethanol in the electrolyte, whose initial reversible electrochemical capacity is 1144 mA h g−1, and the activation barrier is also reduced from 3.4 to 3.1 V in the initial charging process shows 37% capacity retention rate after 100 cycles. Interestingly, Zha's team further developed an ethanol solution (C2H5OH) strategy to optimize the electrochemical properties of Li–S cells,67 which mixes C2H5OH with CS2 (carbon disulfide) solution to form a Li2S catholyte, avoiding any complex operations (Fig. 3f). Compared to bulk Li2S, the preliquid Li2S cell is activated by 3.0 V with only 0.2 V potential barrier (Fig. 3g), representing a stable electrochemical capacity (590 mA h g−1) with 2 mg cm−2 mass loading and retains the corresponding 90% capacity at a rate of 0.5C after stable cycling for 200 cycles (Fig. 3h). Very impressively, Shi and Xiang et al. reported trace sulfone (SL)-assisted-NH4I as a bifunctional additive to dissolve Li2S to promote redox reactions.68 The interaction of sulfone (SL)-assisted-NH4I and Li2S can effectively dissolve the Li2S particles, leading to a lower potential barrier (3.0 V), where the optimized cell capacity is 1160 mA h g−1 at 0.05C. Recently, Yang's group revealed a functional electrolyte to dissolve Li2S, which is an ε-caprolactam and acetamide material.69 Under these conditions, the Li2S cathode achieves a reversible electrochemical capacity of 1360 mA h g−1 and a stable performance for 200 cycles. More importantly, this nonflammable cosolvent electrolyte will be beneficial to the application. The Liu team also demonstrated that ammonium salts can promote the dissolution of Li2S to 1.25 M in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent at room temperature, which delivers a capacity of 730 mA h g−1 at 0.5C.70 These results provide novel insight into better Li2S-based devices with enhanced reaction kinetics and reduced reaction overpotential by the facile loading method of Li2S solution.
3 Functional materials in the presolvation of Li2S cells
The strong chemical interaction between functional materials, Li2S, and polysulfides can improve the capacity of Li2S-based batteries,6,41,71 which facilitates the free migration of polysulfides in the electrolyte by physical confinement and/or chemical adsorption to enhance the redox conversion efficiency of polysulfides by various catalytic materials. By modifying the carbon surface with heteroatoms (e.g., oxygen, nitrogen, and boron), nonpolar carbon materials can be converted to polar hosts.72 These heteroatoms can chemically anchor polysulfides by forming polar interactions. Apart from heteroatom-doped carbon materials, metal oxides/sulfides/phosphides have been proven capable of confining polysulfides via chemical interactions such as “lithium bonding” and electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged active sites in polysulfides and host materials.3 For example, metal oxides have been widely reported to confine polysulfides by polar–polar interactions. The strong polarity allows them to form metal–sulfur and/or oxygen–lithium bonds. Additionally, the complex multistep reactions and sluggish redox kinetics enhance the polysulfide migration. Metal sulfides can significantly decrease the activation energy barrier by forming stable reaction intermediates. Metal sulfides also show catalytic properties in the conversion of soluble polysulfides and oxidation of Li2S during charging and discharging. In general, functional materials have positive effects for improved Li2S-based battery performance.46,73
3.1 Carbon materials
Generally, the preliquid Li2S cathode can reduce the initial activation barrier to avoid the decomposition of the electrolyte, enabling more stable battery performance with a longer cycle life.14 Nevertheless, the intrinsically nonconductive nature of Li2S and polysulfide shuttling behavior are still not negligible.49 Therefore, functional materials tend to be applied to enhance the conductivity and impede the “shuttle” effect. Among them, the carbon material is an efficient and inexpensive option due to its strong conductivity (approximately 5000 S cm−1 for carbon nanotubes), flexible fabrication processes, and rich resources in nature.38,39,49,74–79
In what follows, the hierarchical electrodes of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) are suitable options for manufacturing composites with preliquid Li2S to restrict the migration of polysulfides.75,80,81 Furthermore, the combination of the two carbon materials can constitute a three-dimensional (3D) construction of the cathode with enough inner space for the electrochemical reactions in polysulfides during Li–S cell cycling. To date, researchers have developed diverse ways to prepare preliquid Li2S–carbon composite cathodes (after electrode drying, Li2S materials are uniformly covered with the carbon material).44,49,74,81,82 The facile approach is directly dropping Li2S solution onto carbon materials, which can be extremely easy and convenient. Another method is to encapsulate Li2S nanoparticles by combining Li2S solution with precursors for further carbonization, resulting in a more stable structure at a lower cost. In 2015, the Li and Chen team developed a flexible rGO-based Li2S cathode, which is constituted by the facile dropping of the Li2S solution (Fig. 4a).83 This flexible Li2S-based rGO cathode will be utilized directly as the cathode in conjunction with “lithium metal-free” anodes, which include nano silicon/copper materials, oxides, graphite, graphene, and so on. Under this free-standing cathode design (cutoff charge potential of 3.6 V), the cycling capacity of the Li2S/rGO cell can remain 462 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 5C current. The as-prepared Li2S/rGO cell also exhibits an outstanding rate capability, with capacities of approximately 1000, 900, 750, 700, and 640 mA h g−1 under 0.05, 0.1, 1, 3, and 5C, respectively. At a high current of 7C, this cell still maintains a stable reversible performance of 597 mA g−1 (Fig. 4b). To optimize the structure of carbon materials, the He group fabricated freestanding cathodes of 3D CNT-graphene-Li2S,33 exhibiting reversible performance of Li–S cells (approximately 1100 mA h g−1) and a low fading capacity (0.02% per cycle). Additionally, this cell exhibits approximately 500 mA h g−1 at 4C at 3.6 V charge potential. Owing to such tailoring of microstructures, the 3D CNT-graphene-Li2S cathode shows freestanding and binder-free features. In conclusion, the optimization of the mesopore structure comes from one-dimensional (1D) CNTs. In addition, the enhanced redox electron transfer and improved interface of the electrolyte/electrode come from the 3D framework of cathodes, which enhance both the electrochemical activity and utilization rate of Li2S.33,75,84–91

Furthermore, the active site design of carbon achieves advanced capacities of Li–S cells by chemical doping. Therefore, the A. Manthiram team presented a facile way in which liquid Li2S infiltrates into doped 3D-modified graphene aerogels as a freestanding electrode for Li2S-based batteries with better properties.84 By adding boric acid (H3BO3) or dicyandiamide (C2H4N4) as a dopant for the hydrothermal reaction, B-doped graphene aerogels with a density of 0.09 g cm−3 and N-doped graphene aerogels with a density of 0.07 g cm−3 are eventually synthesized. In the fabrication process, the liquid infiltration–evaporation treatment technique is used to prepare the preliquid Li2S-coated graphene cathode (Fig. 4c).84 The as-assembled cells have an initial charging potential of 4.0 V at 0.1C rate, and the Li2S-modified graphene aerogel electrodes show no obvious initial potential barrier in the charging stage. In contrast, the commercial Li2S-based control group shows a high initial charging voltage barrier, which results from the large charge-transfer resistance of insulating Li2S particles in the delithiation process (Fig. 4d). By discussing the performance of cell cycling, the Li2S-modified graphene electrodes exhibit high initial capacities of 801 mA h g−1 (B-doped graphene) and 720 mA h g−1 (N-doped graphene) at 0.3C rate, respectively.84
Given the abovementioned results, the better cycling performance of the Li2S-based cell is attributed to the improved chemical absorption of polysulfides by B- and N-doped carbon. Borrowing from the idea of doping of a single atom, multiatom codoping may be conducive to better performance of Li–S cells, which will offer sufficient active sites for the stable adsorption of polysulfides and more doped atom characteristics.33,44,75,83 For instance, He et al. reported cobalt and nitrogen codoped stabilized graphitic carbon (C–Co–N), which was obtained by carbonization of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs, named ZIF-67).92 The prepared C–Co–N materials serve as an effective carbon substrate for hosting Li2S solution by the liquid infiltration–evaporation technique (Fig. 4e). In the architecture of the C–Co–N composite, polysulfides can be physically trapped by the host and chemically adsorbed by molecular interactions, and the more highly efficient electron transfer/ionic diffusion is enhanced by its special 3D structure.50,65,78,92,93 Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) reveals that the Lewis-base substrate of C–Co–N materials with a conductive nature can form electron-pair donors with strong anchoring and gain better Li2S-based cell performances. With these merits, the Li2S–C–Co–N cathode shows outstanding rate performance, producing high specific capacities of 1155, 1030, 950, 898, 604, and 372 mA h g−1, where the corresponding rates are 1/5, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, and 6C, respectively (Fig. 4f).92 After the long-term cycle test, the Li2S–C–Co–N-cell also shows 1155 mA h g−1 and retains 80% of the initial capacity (929 mA h g−1) after 300 cycles and almost 100% coulombic efficiency. Additionally, Tao et al. synthesized nitrogen-doped carbon materials that were used in Li2S activation for the first time. This result demonstrates that pyridinic nitrogen can not only provide strong bonding with polysulfides but also acts as the active site to decrease the activation barriers for Li2S decomposition.94 To further strengthen the carbon structure,74 the G. Yushin team built a hierarchical structure of a Li2S cathode with a nanocomposite particle-shell Li2S solution (ethanol) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) mixed, evaporated, and heated to obtain carbon shell-coated Li2S.95 After chemical vapor deposition (CVD), a smooth and uniform carbon layer is generated without changing the Li2S nanoparticle distribution. This layered particle-shell architecture can prevent the collapse of shells during Li extraction and physically prohibit polysulfide migration between electrodes (inset of Fig. 4g). Moreover, the abovementioned Li2S cells exhibit high performances of 1280 and 1050 mA h g−1 at rates of 1/5 and 1/2C and a cycling life of up to 300 cycles, respectively (Fig. 4g). In the meantime, the G. Yushin and B. Zhang team performed a uniform deposition of Li2S–ethanol solution on graphene by linking ex situ with in situ surface technologies.44 Because of the low surface tension of ethanol solution, Li2S achieves high coating uniformity on the surface of the defect of GO materials. Low vacuum (approximately 50 torr) treatment boosts the solution soaking into the space of GO, and then the final CVD procedure creates a similar carbon layer to maintain the stable structure (inset of Fig. 4h). Under the discussion of cycling stability, this cathode exhibits a performance of approximately 1000 mA h g−1 and retains approximately 970 mA h g−1 after 700 cycles at C/2 (Fig. 4h). Therefore, the design of a carbon-based presolvation Li2S cathode has important significance for improving the properties of Li–S batteries.44,49,95–98 Of note, despite its popularity in Li–S battery research, pure carbon barely shows electrocatalytically active polysulfide conversion and is far from the ideal cathode catalyst in high-performance Li–S batteries. Although doping strategies of carbon can increase the performance of Li–S batteries, they also increase the cost of material synthesis.
3.2 Metal compounds
Compared to the atomic doping of carbon materials, functional materials (metal sulfides, metal oxides, and so on) couple directly with the cathode, which further enhances the better properties of Li2S-based cells.41,99,100 Nanostructured functional materials can afford more physical/chemical trap sites for polysulfides and shorten the ion/electron diffusion length, thus promoting redox-electrochemistry with enhanced electrochemical reaction kinetics.22,37,41,77,99–102

3.2.1 Metal sulfides. 
Among the various metal compounds, metal sulfides have abundant resources on Earth, which has attracted researchers' interest in different fields, especially in energy storage systems.41,103 Metal sulfides have some advantages, as described below. The first is the strong anchoring property for the polysulfide-containing species between the Li atoms of lithium polysulfide (LiPS) and the S atoms of metal sulfides.54 Second, metal sulfides are generally metallic or semimetallic with better electrical conductivity.37 Lastly, the interfacial active sites of metal sulfides can promote the conversion of polysulfides by the absorption effect on the substrate, thus restraining polysulfide migration.10,41,99,104 The Y. Cui team discovered that the electrochemical reaction process of Li2S is critical for obtaining the high performance and better cycling properties of Li–S batteries, where Li2S can be formed by electrochemically depositing polysulfides and/or chemically disproportionately depositing polysulfides (Fig. 5a).41 According to the first-principles calculations, six metal sulfides (SnS2, CoS2, FeS, TiS2, VS2, and Ni3S2) are selected as model systems to analyze the interaction of Li2S conversion and polysulfide adsorption. During the initial charging process, the SnS2-Li2S, Ni3S2-Li2S, FeS-Li2S, CoS2-Li2S, VS2-Li2S, and TiS2-Li2S cathodes (Fig. 5b) demonstrate various potential barriers (3.53, 3.47, 3.25, 3.01, 2.91, and 2.88 V, respectively). Compared to pure carbon materials and Ni3S2-, SnS2-, and FeS-based cathodes, the VS2-, TiS2-, and CoS2-decorated electrodes show better cell performance, higher specific capacity, and lower overpotential, which is consistent with the DFT calculations.41

Based on the above results of metal sulfides and carbon, A. Manthiram and Y. Chen et al. synthesized a 3D transition-metal sulfide-modified carbon sponge (3DTSC) with outstanding electrocatalytic activity,97 where 3DTSC is made up of transition-metal sulfide nanodots (TS, TS = NiS, CoS, MnS) of 0D morphology, carbon nanowires of 1D morphology, and graphene nanosheets of two-dimensional (2D) morphology. The carbon host, built by the carbon nanowires combined with graphene nanosheets, provides adequate space for loading sulfur materials and ensures excellent ionic diffusion and electron transfer. In addition, the homogenously distributed metal sulfide nanodots provide high catalytic activity to anchor sulfide species (Fig. 5c).97 Taking a 3D CoS-modified carbon sponge (3DCSC) as an example, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image shows that abundant Li2S nanoparticles are uniformly scattered in the 3DCSC substrate (Fig. 5d), where Li2S is dissolved in ethanol solution and embedded into the 3DCSC electrode. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of 3DTSC electrode-based symmetric cells both exhibit the strongest oxidation/reduction peak of current, which corresponds to a high open-circuit voltage, and further prove the efficient electrocatalysis effect toward LiPS redox (Fig. 5e). The results also match with the first charge curves (Fig. 5f). In the cycling stability of 3DCSC-Li2S-, 3DNSC-Li2S-, and 3DMSC-Li2S-based cells (Fig. 5g), these cathodes show excellent cycling capacities of approximately 1050, 1020, and 916 mA h g−1, respectively, maintaining stabilized specific capacities of approximately 900, 700, and 500 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles, respectively. The aforementioned cells show better performance than that of the reference group (3DC-Li2S cell), which is 600 mA h g−1.97 However, sulfides exhibit lithiation processes with lithium ions that affect their structural stability. The unstable sulfides cannot perform the full potential of catalysis ability.


3.2.2 Metal oxides. 
Oxides are one of the most widely investigated metal compounds in Li–S batteries23,86,87,90,100,103,105–107 and are low-cost, environmentally friendly, and structurally stable. More importantly, metal oxides have a strong anchoring effect to trap polysulfides by using the oxidation state of oxygen sites in the Li–S cell. G. Yushin and coworkers reported the core–shell nanocomposites of Li2S–LiTiO2 as cathodes by adding Li2S materials dissolved in ethanol and titanium materials (Ti),107 followed by evaporation and heat-treatment. The outer surface of Li2S is covered with the layered LiTiO2, which comes from the chemical reduction of TiO2 by Li2S. This composite electrode shows enhanced ionic and electronic conduction, and the layered LiTiO2 shell enables stronger chemical bonds for polysulfides to minimize their migration (Fig. 6a). The corresponding SEM results reveal that the Li2S nanoparticles are 100–400 nm with multimicron-sized agglomerates (Fig. 6b), where LiTiO2 nanoparticles are evenly scattered and contain Li2S inside the LiTiO2 shells. Next, the Bragg peaks of X-ray diffraction (XRD) represent the reduction of TiO2 to form layered LiTiO2 without impurity phases in the Li2S–LiTiO2 composites (Fig. 6c). Benefiting from the layered LiTiO2 structure, these cells (1.2 mg cm−2 mass loading), after 400 cycles, show initial capacities of ∼1000 and 798 mA h g−1 and retain approximately 80 and 90% capacities at 0.5C and 1C, respectively. When increasing the Li2S loading to 2.5 mg cm−2, the cell can retain 83% capacity after 400 cycles at 0.5C. More specifically, as the loading of the active material reaches 4.8 mg cm−2 at 0.5C (Fig. 6d), the Li2S-based LiTiO2 cathode offers approximately 580 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles (92% capacity retention).107 However, such materials suffer from low conductivity with limited reaction kinetics in catalyzing polysulfides. The ineffective conversion of soluble polysulfides may increase their build-up in the cathode and enhance their escape from the cathode via diffusion.

3.2.3 Multimetallic complexes. 
Despite the advantages mentioned above, the poorly conductive metal oxides decrease the electrochemical reaction kinetics.106,108 On the other hand, the high-density metal oxides can cause lower kinetics of Li–S cells because of their high molecular weight.109–112 Considering the above, the Cui team combined the benefits of polar metal phosphosulfides with nonpolar carbon materials to enhance the performance of Li2S-based cells,113 and designed a three-dimensional cage structure of graphene materials (G) with an outer shell of nickel phosphosulfide (Ni–P–S). Li2S@Ni–P–S@G was fabricated by dipping Li2S (dissolved in anhydrous ethanol) into Ni–P–S@G (Fig. 6e). In the electrochemical analysis of CV profiles, the redox curves of Li2S@Ni–P–S@G electrodes show comparatively improved kinetics than the Li2S@G and commercial Li2S cathodes. The preliquid Li2S provides a better distribution in the optimized electrode structure of Ni–P–S@G with better electrochemical properties (Fig. 6f). For the comparison of cycling performance, the Li2S@Ni–P–S@G cathode represents a reversible specific capacity of 670 mA h g−1 with 100 stable cycles (nearly 100% coulombic efficiency), which is better than that of the commercial Li2S (88 mA h g−1), Li2S@G (376 mA h g−1), Li2S@Ni–S@G (505 mA h g−1), and Li2S@Ni–P@G (540 mA h g−1) cathodes (Fig. 6g). The improved cycling performance of the Li2S@Ni–P–S@G electrode can effectively facilitate the electron/ion transport process, improve the reaction kinetics of Li2S-based cells, and suppress the dissolution of polysulfides.113 Compared with research on other metal compounds, research on metal phosphides is lacking. Tao's team demonstrated that transition metal phosphides (Ni2P, Co2P, and Fe2P) can not only effectively anchor soluble polysulfides but also promote Li2S conversion reactions, thus improving the utilization of activating materials.114 Unfortunately, it remains a challenge to synthesize and design multimetallic materials. Currently, most studies have focused on single-metallic sulfides due to the challenge of constructing complex crystalline structures and atom space configurations.

3.3 Organic compounds
As mentioned above, Li2S solvent strategies optimize the contact of the reaction interface to reduce the initial activation barrier, which includes dissolution in ethanol, tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether, and carbon disulfide. Functional organic materials are applied to Li–S cells due to their high theoretical capacities, sustainability, and low cost. To further improve the multielectron reduction reactions of Li2S, the Fu team used dimethyltrisulfide as the cathode material by forming LiSCH3 (two lithium thiomethoxides) and Li2S to enhance its redox reactions in rechargeable lithium batteries.115 The liquid dimethyltrisulfide (DMTS) material is miscible with the electrolyte to form a catholyte, which exhibits a 4 e− reduction process with a theoretical capacity of 849 mA h g−1 during redox reactions. Additionally, the current collector is constituted of binder-free multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) paper, which is a reservoir for holding cycled products (Fig. 7a). In the first discharge curve of the Li/DMTS cell, the cell shows 85% of the theoretical performance (10 h discharge time), where the practical discharge time is 8.5 h. Additionally, the 2nd cycle curve manifests a similar voltage curve as the former (Fig. 7b). More importantly, the specific energy of DMTS-based cells is indeed higher than those of most mentioned rechargeable lithium batteries even at a low electrolyte/DMTS ratio. When the ratio of electrolyte/DMTS is 5.7:1 (mL g−1) in the 5th cycle, the corresponding energies of Li/DMTS and electrodes/electrolyte are 1106 and 147 W h kg−1, respectively. At a DMTS/electrolyte ratio of 1:3 mL g−1, the corresponding energies of Li/DMTS and electrodes/electrolyte are 1025 and 229 W h kg−1, respectively (Fig. 7c).115

The catalytic mediators serve as a charge shuttle to facilitate and promote redox electron transport from the conductive substrate to Li2S. The initial voltage to activate Li2S can be decreased by accelerated redox interactions, which results in the formation of soluble intermediates that are simpler to oxidize.116 Meini et al. for the first time introduced the application of redox mediators (RM) to lower the activation potential of Li2S (Fig. 7d).117 Five different mediators are investigated with different redox potentials, where lithium iodide, ferrocene, and decamethylferrocene all show a higher voltage than the reaction voltage of Li2S, thereby effectively affecting the redox potential. By comparing these compounds, decamethylferrocene can reduce the activation potential barrier of Li2S to approximately 2.9 V (Fig. 7e) and enhance the performance of Li2S cells with an initial discharge performance of 750 mA h g−1 at a current of 0.2C, retaining approximately 67% of the capacity after 150 cycles. During the charging process, the corresponding XRD analysis supports the abovementioned hypothesis. After the oxidation potential reached 3.6 V, a negligible amount of Li2S is left in the cathode matrices in the ferrocene-, LiI-, and decamethylferrocene-based cells. In all other cases, the Bragg peaks of Li2S are strongly visible in the XRD pattern, which indicates insufficient utilization of the Li2S material (Fig. 7f).117
Since then, researchers have been dedicated to studying RMs for reducing Li2S charge overpotential. The Helms group further introduced a new redox mediator, benzo[ghi]peryleneimide (BPI), to accelerate the reduction reaction of polysulfides into Li2S on carbon current collectors.118 In the presence of BPI, Li2S can be electrodeposited on carbon cloth to form a 3D porous structure during cell discharge (Fig. 7g). In the CV curves, the reduction potential of BPI is approximately 1.98 V, providing 0.1 V to enhance the kinetics of the reduction reaction for sulfur species (Fig. 7h). Such a minimal potential ensures that BPI may reduce dissolved polysulfides to Li2S without considerably lowering the operational potential in the Li–S cell. Moreover, the galvanostatic cycling curves show a magnificent 2.2-fold value in the performance of the Li–S battery (800 mA h g−1), where the free-BPI cell shows approximately 300 mA h g−1 discharge capacity (Fig. 7i). Thus, long-range electron transport is enhanced by conductive carbon, and the efficient redox charge transfer and short-range transport between the polysulfides and the carbon electrode are distinctly improved by BPI. Next, Tsao and coworkers reported an interesting redox mediator in which adding 1,5-bis(2-(2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy) anthra-9,10-quinone (AQT) into an electrolyte achieved an impressive discharge capacity and an initial charging voltage below 2.5 V at 0.5C.119 In AQT with a Li2S cathode of 4 mg cm−2, the cell delivers 600 mA h g−1 capacity and retains 70% capacity at a rate of 0.1C after 100 cycles. It follows that the simple addition of organic materials is a facile and noninvasive method.120Table 1 shows the summary of Li2S with different solvents, where the advantages and disadvantages of different solvents are analyzed.

4 Outlook and summary
For the sake of a high energy density energy storage system, rechargeable Li–S batteries that utilize sulfur as the cathode could be an available option. However, if researchers can provide sufficient measures to address the poor irreversibility and security risks of lithium, the commercial applications of Li–S batteries will be further promoted. Following modern development trends, replacing sulfur with lithium sulfide (Li2S) as the lithium-containing cathode represents an alternative solution to avoid reactive lithium metal issues. Despite the combination with the lithium-free anode, there is also considerable room for improvements in fully lithiated Li2S, which suffers from a high charging overpotential, low electrical conductivity, and poor ion diffusivity. Given these results, significant progress has been made for Li2S cathodes by fabricating electrodes of Li2S cathodes with better performance and adding electrolyte additives to provide feasibility in commercializing Li2S-based batteries. Meanwhile, the activation energy of Li2S is affected by a highly stable ionic crystal, which is an antifluorite structure with the opposite arrangement. The corresponding anions show coordination number 8 in the face-centered cubic array, and cations have coordination number 4 in the tetrahedral holes. Due to this structure, the stronger bond energy of Li2S shows a higher standard enthalpy of formation. Additionally, the actual structure (i.e., amorphous), morphology, particle size, catalyst varieties, and area of reaction contact affect the activation process of Li2S during the first charge cycle. Ergo, the optimization strategies based on the above factors can contribute to a decreased activation barrier, better utilization of Li2S, and improved performance, which includes electrode design and material synthesis. Compared to solid Li2S, Li2S solution can expand the contact area between the activated materials and hosts and further lead to more nucleation sites. Moreover, the fast diffusion rate of solvating Li2S can promote charge transfer and reduce the ion transfer path, thereby enhancing the kinetics of the reaction interface and oxidation process of Li2S.
Hence, this review attempts to comprehensively summarize the presolvation strategies of Li2S for the development of Li–S cells. Although many methods have been proposed and developed (Table 2), research on Li2S is still lacking. For example, with regard to the fundamental electrochemical study and engineering of cathodes, considerable work needs to be done. From our point of view, future research can pursue the following directions:

First, in situ analytical techniques may offer valuable references (such as Raman spectroscopy, electron spin resonance spectroscopy, and X-ray spectroscopy) to better understand the electrochemical reaction process. The obtained results could provide significant improvements in the rational design of solvated Li2S cathodes.
Second, the obtained Li2S-based batteries would have to reduce the high initial charging barrier but also suppress the “shuttle” effect. The shuttling of polysulfides is as important as Li2S activation, which can be fully explained in most sulfur-based batteries. Therefore, the structural design of Li2S cathode materials should be considered as an integral strategy that combines electrocatalysts with physical material modification. Due to Li2S being sensitive to moisture and prone to hydrolyze in air, developing reasonable synthetic strategies to keep Li2S stable is an interesting direction as well.
Third, the development of Li-free, high-capacity anodes and electrolytes can be of great importance in Li2S-based batteries. To date, some researchers have chosen graphite, silicon, or tin as the anode to match with Li2S cathodes. However, their low electronic conductivity and large volume change during charging/discharging should be settled. Adding novel electrolyte strategies is an effective way to overcome the above issues.
In the end, the presolvation approach of Li2S has received much interest since it is a simple way to change the contact interface of solid–solid into the greater contacting area of the solid–liquid state. After solvent evaporation from the Li2S solution, low surface tension solvents can lead to fast homogenous nucleation rates and facilitate the uniform distribution of Li2S particles, decreasing the activation barrier. However, the presolvation strategy of solvents need to be prepurified operation, additional cost, and assembly step, which both should be further improved to develop presolvation technology.
