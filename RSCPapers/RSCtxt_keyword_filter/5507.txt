    , Accepted 11th August 2014First published on 11th August 2014AbstractReduced graphene oxide-based films were prepared to assess their effects as gas barriers on the stability of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. The direct spin-casting of a graphene oxide suspension onto an aluminum electrode was performed to encapsulate the associated OPV device with a reduced graphene oxide film. The lifetime of the OPV device after the reduction process was found to be increased by a factor of 50. The gas barrier properties of a graphene oxide layer are closely related to its surface roughness and dispersibility. Furthermore, these gas barrier properties can be enhanced by controlling the thermal reduction conditions. The thermal reduction of a graphene oxide film at a low heating rate results in a low water vapor permeability, only 0.1% of that of an as-prepared polyethylene naphthalate film. These results indicate that the dispersibility, surface roughness, and reduction conditions of a graphene oxide film significantly influence its gas barrier performance. Further investigations of the reduction of graphene oxide films are expected to enable further improvements in performance.

Broader context
The organic photovoltaic (OPV) device is a promising next generation solar cell because it is a lightweight and flexible device fabricated by low-cost and facile manufacturing. However, the power conversion efficiency of the OPV device degrades rapidly under ambient conditions due to the low stability of a conjugated polymer. To enhance the lifetime of OPV devices, encapsulation of devices from the water vapor in the atmosphere is critical. Our paper presents two methods for the fabrication of encapsulated films based on reduced graphene oxide for OPV devices: direct preparation and casting on a flexible substrate. The first method was found with a single spin-casting process to enhance the device lifetime by a factor of nearly 50, which provides a moderate lifetime. The reduced graphene oxide film prepared by the second method showed very low water vapor permeability, providing a long device lifetime. This method is compatible with roll-to-roll processing and may lead to flexible OPV devices with long lifetime.

Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices are viewed as potential next-generation photovoltaic devices because they are lightweight and flexible, and their solution processing is facile.1,2 However, the short lifetimes of OPV devices limit their applications.3,4 The poor stability of OPV devices is due to several factors, such as morphology changes in the active layer5 and the degradation of PEDOT:PSS and their electrodes.6 However, the main factor is the chemical oxidation of their active materials.4,7,8 Conjugated polymers are easily oxidized in the presence of oxidizing agents, especially water vapor under ambient conditions, and light, which leads to the degradation of organic electronic devices.7 OPV devices should be encapsulated to prevent such performance degradation. The encapsulation of organic devices by attaching glass with an epoxy resin is a straightforward means of protecting them against water vapor on the laboratory scale. Glass with a very low water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) is necessary.9 However, this method is unsuitable for flexible devices due to the brittleness of glass. Polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) has attracted much interest as an alternative to glass substrates because of its high strength, high modulus, good chemical resistivity, good thermal resistivity, and gas barrier properties. However, the WVTR of PEN is 3 g per m2 per day, which is too high to provide sufficient protection for OPV devices. Therefore, a flexible encapsulation system is still required for flexible organic electronic devices.
Graphene has recently attracted much attention in this area of research because of its high specific surface area,10,11 useful mechanical properties,12 and gas impermeability.13,14 Small gas molecules including helium cannot pass through graphene layers,15 so graphene is a good candidate for gas barrier films in organic electronic devices. Among the synthesis routes recently proposed for the preparation of graphene, the chemical exfoliation of graphite with a subsequent reduction step enables solution-processing and up-scaling.16 A graphene oxide (GO) layer is chemically exfoliated graphite with many epoxide, hydroxyl, ketone, and carboxyl groups on its surface. GO has high dispersibility in polar solvents and forms a stable colloidal solution that can be solution-processed.17 GO is quite different from graphene due to its many functional groups, but it is easily reduced by heat treatment or chemical reagents into reduced GO (rGO).17 RGO has a more hydrophobic surface because most oxygen-containing groups are removed by the reduction process.17,18
In this paper, we demonstrate that simply and directly prepared rGO films on OPV devices enhance their stability in ambient air. The dispersibility of GO is significantly influenced by the selection of the graphite material and the dispersion method. A GO solution obtained from large-flake graphite, specifically via horn-type sonication, was found to exhibit high dispersibility, and to produce an rGO film with good gas barrier performance. The water vapor permeability of an rGO film prepared on a flexible substrate can be enhanced by controlling the reduction conditions. Slow heating during the thermal reduction of a GO film results in a low surface roughness, a small BET specific surface area, and a low water vapor permeability value.
Experimental
Preparation of the GO solution
GO solutions were prepared with a modified Hummer's method from powder graphite with a small particle size (Sigma Aldrich), powder graphite with a medium particle size (Bay Carbon), and large-flake graphite (Sigma Aldrich) (denoted as GO(S), GO(M), and GO(L), respectively). The solvent of the as-prepared GO aqueous suspensions was changed to isopropanol (IPA) by repeated centrifugation and resuspension in IPA. The GO(L) suspension was sonicated for 30 min to enhance the dispersion. The fragmented GO in the sonicated suspension was removed by centrifugation at 10000 rpm for 30 min (denoted as GO(L, sonic)).
Fabrication and characterization of the OPV devices
ITO/glass substrates were cleaned by sonication in a detergent and in acetone and IPA. The ITO substrates were then treated with UV/ozone for 15 min. To fabricate the OPV devices with a normal structure, PEDOT:PSS was spin-cast at 5000 rpm for 40 s. The PEDOT:PSS films were dried at 150 °C for 15 min and then transferred into a glovebox filled with argon. Active layers were spin-cast from a solution of P3HT:PC60BM in o-dichlorobenzene at 800 rpm for 30 s. In the preparation of each PCDTBT:PC70BM solar cell, a solution of 4 mg of PCDTBT and 16 mg of PC70BM in 1 mL of chlorobenzene was spin-cast at 2500 rpm for 40 s onto the PEDOT:PSS layer and subsequently TiOx precursor solution was spin-cast at 5000 rpm for 40 s. The devices were completed by the thermal evaporation of a 100 nm Al cathode. The PCEs of the devices were determined using a K3000 instrument (McScience). To determine the stabilities of the OPV devices, they were stored in ambient air under illumination.
Preparation and characterization of the rGO films
The spin-coating of the GO suspension onto each aluminum electrode was repeated three times at 2000 rpm. To obtain the GO encapsulated devices, thermal annealing was performed for 30 min at 150 °C before the spin-casting of the GO layer. To obtain the rGO encapsulated devices, thermal annealing was performed after the spin-casting of the GO layer. A schematic diagram of an OPV device prepared by the direct spin-casting method is shown in Scheme 1(a).

PEN/rGO films were prepared by performing the doctor blading of the GO suspension onto PEN films with subsequent heat treatment, then used in permeability measurements and to encapsulate a PCDTBT:PC70BM solar cell. rGO(L, sonic)_01C and rGO(L, sonic)_10C were heated to 200 °C at rates of 0.1 °C min−1 and 10 °C min−1, respectively. A schematic diagram of an OPV device prepared by this method is shown in Scheme 1(b). The water vapor permeabilities of the films were measured using a MOCON instrument at 38 °C and 100% relative humidity.
Results and discussion
In the preparation of rGO films on OPV devices directly from the GO solution, damage to the OPV devices during the processing of the GO layers should be avoided. Therefore, chlorinated solvents and water cannot be used as the solvents for the GO solution. In addition, other polar solvents such as dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, and ethylene glycol also degrade OPV devices (Fig. S1†). Alcohols have previously been used to spin-cast hole blocking layers and in solvent treatments of active layers.19,20 The treatment of aluminum in OPV devices with alcohol has been found not to influence their performances, which indicates that alcohols are suitable solvents for direct solvent-processing on aluminum. IPA was chosen for the spin-casting of the GO layer onto the OPV device based on our preliminary results for the degradation of the devices and the dispersibility of GO.
GO is chemically exfoliated from raw graphite, so the physical and chemical properties of GO can differ from those of the raw material. Although the performances of the GO samples prepared from different raw graphite samples are expected to vary when utilized in applications, there are no available guidelines for selecting the type of GO appropriate for any specific application. Therefore, we needed to determine which type of GO is appropriate for the preparation of gas barrier films. In this study, we prepared GO by means of exfoliation from small-particle powder graphite, medium-particle powder graphite, and large-flake graphite, all of which have previously been used to produce GO. The lateral flake size of GO(L) is greater than tens of micrometers, which is the largest value of the prepared GOs (Fig. S2†), as expected given that the flakes in large-flake graphite are larger than the particles in the powder graphite samples.
The dispersion of nanocarbons has been thoroughly and extensively studied because of the aggregation behavior of nanocarbons.21 In spite of the high dispersibility of GO in water due to the functional groups on its surface, dispersion in other organic solvents such as alcohols is known to be poor.22 A well-dispersed solution is necessary for the preparation of a uniform film by solution-processing methods. All GO samples were dispersed in IPA to prepare GO solutions for direct spin-casting onto OPV devices. Fig. 1 shows the dispersion stabilities of the GO samples in IPA. Note that GO(L) is better dispersed in IPA than GO(S) and GO(M). In contrast to GO(L), GO(S) and GO(M) are not stable in IPA in the long term. Considering that the lateral sizes of the flakes in GO(L) are the largest of the samples, it was expected that GO(L) would exhibit low levels of dispersibility and dispersion stability. This unpredicted result is due to the formation of a stable liquid crystalline phase in solution by GO. According to Onsager's theory, large-flake GO exhibits a liquid crystalline phase due to its high aspect ratio, which results in a stable nematic phase in solution. Indeed, no birefringence was observed in the GO(S) solution (Fig. 1(c)) when the dispersions were placed between polarizers. The emergence of birefringence in the GO(M) and GO(L) suspensions indicates the formation of nematic phases. As the particle size increases, the optical texture becomes more compact, which is associated with the formation of a uniform liquid crystalline phase.23 Thus, the GO(L) suspension was selected for the spin-casting of gas barrier films.

We prepared GO and rGO layers on the aluminum electrodes of the OPV devices by spin-casting the GO solution. The rGO layers were obtained after the thermal annealing of the GO-covered OPV devices at 150 °C for 30 min, which is a conventional thermal treatment for P3HT:PC60BM devices. The performances of the OPV devices are unaffected by the deposition of the GO and rGO layers (Fig. 2). The average power conversion efficiencies of the reference, GO-encapsulated, and rGO-encapsulated devices are 2.82 ± 0.14%, 2.85 ± 0.08%, and 2.85 ± 0.13%, respectively (Table 1). The additional cost of this GO coating process is only 0.004 $ per cm2 because only a very small amount of GO is required. Therefore, this direct spin-casting method for the encapsulation of organic devices is not only simple but also inexpensive.

The stability levels of the devices were characterized and the results are shown in Fig. 3. To check the reproducibility of the stability data, we prepared 4 devices and obtained an average value and standard deviation (Fig. 3(a)). The PCE of the reference sample, which is not encapsulated, decreases dramatically with exposure time. After 12 hours in ambient air, the PCE is 0 (Fig. 3(b)). This result demonstrates the poor stability of P3HT:PC60BM devices exposed to light in ambient air. Interestingly, the devices encapsulated with GO films did not exhibit enhanced stabilities (Fig. 3(c)), which indicates that the GO layers do not protect the devices against water vapor. This result is consistent with the results of Geim et al., who showed that the water permeability of GO films is similar to that of an open aperture. In contrast, the rGO-covered OPV devices exhibited enhanced stability. Thus the simple heat treatment that is performed to increase the efficiency of P3HT:PC60BM devices also increases the gas barrier properties of the rGO film remarkably. The enhancement of stability was the largest for the device encapsulated with an rGO(L) layer. An exposure time of 10 days was required to degrade the performance of the device to 0, which is nearly 20 times longer than the equivalent time for the reference device. The addition of the rGO(M) and rGO(S) layers to the devices also increases their lifetimes, but their effectiveness as barriers is less than that of the rGO(L) film. This result is related to the dispersibility of the GO solutions. Large-flake rGO provides a superior gas barrier film because the large lateral size of the flakes increases the length of the diffusion path of water molecules in the rGO film and the high dispersibility of GO(L) in the suspension facilitates film preparation.

Despite the high dispersion stability of GO(L) in IPA, aggregation occurs after 1 month (Fig. 4(a)). Sonication is commonly used to disperse nanocarbons such as carbon nanotubes, GO, and rGO. However, there is an intrinsic trade-off in the use of sonication on GO suspensions between dispersion and the generation of structural defects. Enhanced GO(L) dispersion was observed after 30 min of sonication (denoted as GO(L, sonic)), and the suspension remained in a dispersed state after 1 month (Fig. 4(b)). However, sonication not only separates large aggregates into a single layer but also reduces the sizes of the GO particles. Indeed, before sonication GO(L) in this experiment had a lateral size on the scale of tens of micrometers, but the lateral size of GO(L, sonic) is approximately 1 micrometer (Fig. 4(c) and (d)). Therefore, the effects of sonication must be taken into account.

The gas barrier performance of the rGO(L, sonic)-based film is better than that of the rGO(L)-based film (Fig. 5). The lifetime of the rGO(L, sonic)-encapsulated OPV device exceeds 600 hours, which is 50 times that of the reference sample. This result indicates that the high dispersibility resulting from sonication improves the performance of the gas barrier film despite the reduction in the lateral size of the GO flakes. Thus, preparation of a fully exfoliated GO suspension is crucial to the fabrication of a high-performance rGO film.

To characterize the water vapor barrier properties of the rGO films quantitatively, the WVTRs and permeabilities of the films were determined. The permeabilities of the GO and rGO films were calculated by using the following equation: (1)where TR is the transmission rate, L is the thickness of the film, and P is the permeability of the film. TRrGO/PEN, LPEN, PPEN, and LrGO were measured, so the permeabilities of the rGO films can be calculated. The permeability of the GO film is high (Table 2), as expected from the results for the OPV device encapsulated with the GO film. After thermal treatment, the permeability of the rGO films is reduced by 85% with respect to that of the GO film. The barrier properties are further enhanced when a sonicated GO solution is used. The permeabilities of the films are in good agreement with the results obtained for the stabilities of the OPV devices. Both the water vapor permeability results and those for the degradation of the OPV devices demonstrate that sonication of the GO suspension is necessary to disperse and exfoliate the aggregated GO completely.

The permeabilities of the rGO films are lower than that of the GO film for two reasons. First, water vapor transmission is significantly influenced by the chemical nature of the film. Hydrophobic polymers usually exhibit lower WVTRs than hydrophilic polymers.24 One of the most famous water vapor barrier polymers is Cytop™, which is a perfluoropolymer. The surfaces of perfluoropolymers are very hydrophobic, and thus block water vapor effectively. Likewise, rGO is hydrophobic, whereas GO is hydrophilic due to its reduced oxygen functional groups. This hydrophobic surface prevents the permeation of water vapor. Second, the interlayer distance is an important factor in water vapor permeation. The interlayer distance is decreased by the reduction process, so the permeation of water vapor is restricted.
The low specific surface area (SSA) of the GO(L, sonic) sample also contributes to its high gas barrier performance. Materials consisting of smaller particles usually have a higher SSA, so GO(L, sonic) is expected to have a larger SSA than GO(L) due to the smaller lateral size of the flakes in GO(L, sonic). However, the SSA of GO(L, sonic) is smaller than that of GO(L) (Table 3). The SSA of unsonicated GO(L) is 6.8 m2 g−1,25 whereas that of GO(L, sonic) is 4.1 m2 g−1. A low BET SSA means that the surface area that can adsorb gas molecules is small, and so gas molecules cannot easily permeate the surface. The difference between GO(L) and GO(L, sonic) is evident in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images. The flakes in GO(L) have very large lateral sizes, but many wrinkles are present on its surface (Fig. 6). In contrast, the surface of the GO(L, sonic) sample is very smooth despite the small lateral size of its component flakes. This series of results can be correlated with the XRD data. The 2θ value of GO(L) is 9.54°,25 which corresponds to an interlayer distance of 9.26 Å; the interlayer distance of GO(L, sonic) is 8.41 Å (Fig. S4†). These results suggest that the gas barrier properties of the rGO films depend on the prevention of the infiltration of gas molecules by the stacking of rGO layers rather than on the lateral size of the rGO layers in the film. The direct spin-casting process realizes OPV devices with mid-term stability, and we expect that devices with still longer stabilities can be achieved with the appropriate control of the physical and chemical properties of GO.

Direct spin-casting of gas barrier films onto organic devices is a very facile and useful method and provides mid-term stability. However, the rGO films have intrinsic limitations as gas barriers because reduction processes must be performed under mild conditions so as not to damage the organic devices. A further improvement in the gas barrier properties of such films can be achieved by using an appropriate reduction process. In this study, additional reduction steps were performed on GO/PEN films to observe their effects on their water vapor permeability values. Many chemical, thermal, and optical methods for the reduction of GO films and powders have been suggested.17,26–28 A typical GO reduction method involves a chemical reaction with a reducing agent such as NaBH4.17 However, GO films on PEN become detached from the substrate during the NaBH4 reduction process (Fig. S5(b)†). Conventional chemical reduction methods are inappropriate for the fabrication of rGO-based gas barrier films on substrates. In contrast, a low-temperature thermal treatment performed below 200 °C is compatible with flexible PEN substrates. Thermal annealing at a low temperature induces reduction without the detachment and/or damage of the GO film (Fig. S5(c)†).
The heating rate employed in the low-temperature thermal reduction process influences the porosity and structure of the resulting rGO,10 which are likely to influence the gas barrier performance. Fig. 7 shows images of flexible and freestanding GO and rGO films. Both the rGO(L, sonic)_10C film (heating rate: 10 °C min−1) and the rGO(L, sonic)_01C film (heating rate: 0.1 °C min−1) are fully reduced and have retained their flexibility, but the surface morphologies of the films are different. The rGO(L, sonic)_10C film has a very rough surface; its higher heating rate produces a surface with a bumpy morphology. The optical microscopy images also show that the rGO(L, sonic)_10C and rGO(L, sonic)_01C films have bumpy and smooth surfaces, respectively.

The surface roughness of the rGO(L, sonic)_10C sample was quantitatively characterized by AFM and found to be 4.7 nm, which is higher than that of rGO(L, sonic)_01C (3.5 nm) (Fig. 8). This microstructural difference results in differences in gas permeation and the SSA. The BET SSA of GO(L, sonic) increases by 85.4% and 65.8% after the reduction at heating rates of 10 °C min−1 and 0.1 °C min−1 respectively (Table 4). A higher heating rate induces a more porous structure and a higher BET SSA. Note that the rGO(L, sonic) samples have lower BET SSAs than the rGO(L) samples. The reduction in the rGO lateral size and the numbers of wrinkles on the surface produced by sonication result in smaller SSA values, as observed for the GO(L) and GO(L, sonic) films.

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results show that the number of oxygen functional groups on the GO surface is decreased by the reduction process (Fig. S6†). We conclude that the heating rate significantly influences the surface morphologies, SSAs, and microstructures of the rGO films but does not affect their reduction state or degree of reduction significantly.
The permeability of the rGO film is decreased by thermal reduction at 200 °C with a low heating rate (Table 2). The permeability of the rGO(L, sonic)_10C film is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the GO film, and lower than the permeabilities of the rGO(L) and rGO(L, sonic) film samples. The permeability of rGO(L, sonic)_01C is even lower because its BET SSA and surface roughness are lower. Our results show that highly reduced rGO with low surface roughness exhibits enhanced gas barrier performance. The permeability of the rGO(L, sonic)_01C sample is only 3.65 × 10−4 g mm per m2 per day, which indicates that the rGO film blocks water vapor more efficiently when the thicknesses of the rGO film and the PEN film are the same. Indeed, the thicknesses of the rGO films employed in this study (0.7 μm) are only 0.6% of that of the PEN film (125 μm), but their WVTRs are lower than that of the PEN film.
The enhanced barrier properties of the rGO films that were achieved by controlling the heating rate were verified by employing them in PCDTBT-based OPV devices. The efficiencies of PCDTBT devices are degraded by thermal treatment,29 so the devices were encapsulated with rGO films prepared on PEN substrates instead of using the direct preparation method. Device testing was performed at a relative humidity of 100% because PCDTBT-based OPV devices have high stability due to the intrinsic stability (Fig. S7†) of the materials and the additional TiOX layer between the active layer and the aluminum electrode. Under these conditions, the efficiency of the PCDTBT:PC70BM cell was found to decrease to 8% after 24 hours (Fig. 9). The OPV devices encapsulated with rGO(L, sonic)_10C and rGO(L, sonic)_01C films exhibited efficiencies of 13% and 43%, respectively, after 240 hours. These stabilities are significantly enhanced over that of the OPV device encapsulated with an as-prepared PEN film (Table 5). These results are in good correlation with our results for the BET SSAs, surface roughnesses, and water vapor permeabilities of the rGO films. Thus this encapsulation method secures the long-term stability of the devices.

Conclusions
In this study, rGO gas barrier films were prepared by two methods. In the first approach, rGO films were directly prepared on OPV devices by using a simple spin-casting method. In the optimum case, the lifetime of an OPV device was increased by a factor of 50 over that of the equivalent control device. In the other method, gas barrier films were prepared on PEN substrates and used to encapsulate OPV devices. The stability of these devices increased remarkably: the PCDTBT:PC70BM inverted devices retained 43% efficiency after 240 hours under conditions of 100% humidity. These results show that by using a stable dispersion of GO and ensuring the low surface roughness of the rGO layer, a high-performance gas barrier film can be realized (Scheme 2).

Broader context
The organic photovoltaic (OPV) device is a promising next generation solar cell because it is a lightweight and flexible device fabricated by low-cost and facile manufacturing. However, the power conversion efficiency of the OPV device degrades rapidly under ambient conditions due to the low stability of a conjugated polymer. To enhance the lifetime of OPV devices, encapsulation of devices from the water vapor in the atmosphere is critical. Our paper presents two methods for the fabrication of encapsulated films based on reduced graphene oxide for OPV devices: direct preparation and casting on a flexible substrate. The first method was found with a single spin-casting process to enhance the device lifetime by a factor of nearly 50, which provides a moderate lifetime. The reduced graphene oxide film prepared by the second method showed very low water vapor permeability, providing a long device lifetime. This method is compatible with roll-to-roll processing and may lead to flexible OPV devices with long lifetime.
