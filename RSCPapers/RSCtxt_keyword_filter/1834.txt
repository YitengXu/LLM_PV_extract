    , Accepted 2nd November 2015First published on 4th November 2015AbstractEfficient lead halide perovskite solar cells have been realized using SnO2 as electron selective layers (ESLs). Here, we report on the effects of the annealing temperature of solution-processed SnO2 ESLs on the performance of perovskite solar cells. We find that the cells using low-temperature annealed SnO2 (LT-SnO2) ESLs outperform the cells using high-temperature annealed SnO2 (HT-SnO2) ESLs, exhibiting higher open circuit voltages and fill factors. Structural, electrical, optical, and electrochemical characterizations reveal the origin of the performance differences: LT-SnO2 produces better film coverage, wider band gap, and lower electron density than that of HT-SnO2. The confluence of these properties results in more effective transportation of electrons and blocking of holes, leading to lower interface recombination. Therefore, LT-SnO2 ESLs are preferred for manufacturing perovskite solar cells on flexible substrates.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite photovoltaic absorbers have attracted an enormous amount of attention in recent years due to their superior photovoltaic properties, such as the extremely high optical absorption coefficient and very long carrier lifetime.1–6 Since 2009, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has rapidly increased from 3.8% to 20.1% (certified).7–14 High-efficiency perovskite solar cells typically use electron selective layers (ESLs) and hole selective layers (HSLs) to selectively extract electrons and holes, respectively, and inhibit interface charge recombination, both of which are necessary for achieving high open circuit voltages (Voc's) and fill factors (FFs).15 Lead halide perovskite solar cells adopt either the regular or inverted structures. For the regular structure, the commonly used ESLs are metal oxides such as TiO2 (ref. 12 and 16–20) and ZnO21,22 and the HSLs are 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)8,23–25 and poly(triarlyamine) (PTAA).13,14 Recently, we have realized efficient perovskite solar cells using low-temperature annealed SnO2 (LT-SnO2) as the ESL.26 Generally speaking, low-temperature annealed metal oxide ESLs are not as preferred over high-temperature annealed ESLs for fabrication of high-efficiency solar cells. Materials processed at higher temperatures typically exhibit higher carrier mobility due to better crystallinity. In order to inhibit interface charge recombination effectively, ESLs and HSLs must have proper energy level alignment with perovskite absorbers and should not exhibit high free carrier concentrations. ESLs and HSLs that exhibit a high carrier mobility tend to facilitate fast carrier transportation. This is the case for TiO2 ESLs. To achieve high performance, the compact TiO2 ESLs usually require sintering at high temperatures.16 It is therefore logical to ask whether or not high-temperature annealed SnO2 (HT-SnO2) ESLs would perform better than LT-SnO2 ESLs.
In this paper, we present a comparative study of perovskite solar cells using both LT-SnO2 and HT-SnO2 ESLs. We show that the perovskite solar cells using LT-SnO2 ESLs exhibit much better performance than the cells using HT-SnO2 ESLs, with higher Voc's and FFs. Through detailed structural, electrical, optical, and electrochemical characterizations, we unveil the origin of the performance differences: (1) LT-SnO2 produces better film coverage and lower electron concentration than that of HT-SnO2, leading to better interface passivation; and (2) LT-SnO2 exhibits a slightly larger band gap than that of HT-SnO2, resulting in a better band edge matching with perovskite absorbers.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the representative cell structure in this study: Au as the back contact, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as the HSL, a vacuum-processed perovskite as the absorber, SnO2 as the ESL, and a fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) coated glass as the front electrode and substrate. We used a thermal evaporation process to produce the perovskite films. This is particularly important for this study because thermal evaporation produces large-area uniform films with good reproducibility. In this case, any performance differences should be attributed to the use of different ESLs (LT-SnO2vs. HT-SnO2). We have systematically examined the influence of annealing temperature of SnO2 ESL on the performance of perovskite solar cells and the annealing of SnO2 at 185 °C produced the highest device performance. For clarity, we report only the results for two representative annealing temperatures: 185 °C and 500 °C.

Fig. 2a shows the transmission spectra of a bare FTO substrate, a 40 nm-thick LT-SnO2 film deposited on an FTO substrate, and a 40 nm-thick HT-SnO2 film deposited on an FTO substrate. Based on our previous study, 40 nm is the optimal thickness of SnO2 to produce high efficiency perovskite solar cells.26 The LT-SnO2 film on the FTO substrate shows a slightly better transmission than the HT-SnO2 film on the FTO substrate. Fig. 2b shows the ultraviolet-visible absorbance spectra of perovskite films grown on LT-SnO2 and HT-SnO2 coated substrates. These spectra are almost identical, due to the deposition of large-area uniform perovskite films by thermal evaporation. Fig. 2c shows two cells using 40 nm-thick LT-SnO2 and HT-SnO2 ESLs, respectively, measured under forward and reverse voltage scanning. The cell using LT-SnO2 ESL achieved a PCE of 15.10% with a Voc of 1.09 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 18.48 mA cm−2, and an FF of 75.04% when measured under reverse voltage scanning and a PCE of 13.27% with a Voc of 1.01 V, a Jsc of 18.47 mA cm−2, and an FF of 71.14% when measured under forward voltage scanning. However, the cell using HT-SnO2 ESL only achieved a PCE of 10.39% with a Voc of 0.97 V, a Jsc of 18.24 mA cm−2, and an FF of 58.65% when measured under reverse voltage scanning and a PCE of 7.62% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 18.01 mA cm−2, and an FF of 49.60% when measured under forward voltage scanning. These results are summarized in Table 1. It is obvious that the cell using LT-SnO2 ESL performs much better than the cell using HT-SnO2 ESL, with higher FF and Voc. Fig. 2d shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the cells using LT-SnO2 and HT-SnO2 ESLs. It is seen that the cell using HT-SnO2 ESL has slightly smaller EQE values in the 350–750 nm wavelength range than the cell using LT-SnO2 ESL, leading to a lower Jsc. As the perovskite films deposited on the LT-SnO2 and HT-SnO2 coated substrates showed identical absorbance spectra (Fig. 2b) and similar morphologies (Fig. S1†), the large difference in Jsc, FF and Voc could be primarily due to the SnO2 ESLs annealed at different temperatures.

Fig. 3 shows the steady-state efficiencies of the cells using LT-SnO2 and HT-SnO2 ESLs. The constant bias voltages of 0.889 V and 0.800 V are consistent with the voltages at the maximum power points of J–V curves of the cells using LT-SnO2 and HT-SnO2 ESLs, respectively. The current densities firstly increased and then stabilized. The difference between the initial and stabilized currents is larger for the cell using HT-SnO2 ESL than for the cell using LT-SnO2 ESL. The cell using LT-SnO2 ESL achieved a steady-state current density of 15.84 mA cm−2 and a steady-state efficiency of 14.08%, which is very close to the value averaged from the efficiencies measured under forward and reverse voltage scanning. However, the cell using HT-SnO2 ESL only achieved a steady-state efficiency of 9.90% with a steady-state current density of 12.38 mA cm−2.

To check the reproducibility of the devices, we fabricated 30 cells using LT-SnO2 ESLs and 30 cells using HT-SnO2 ESLs measured under reverse voltage scanning. The best-performing cell using LT-SnO2 ESL achieved a PCE of 16.05% with a Voc of 1.10 V, a Jsc of 19.54 mA cm−2, and an FF of 74.45% when measured under reverse voltage scanning. The best-performing cell using HT-SnO2 ESL achieved a PCE of 11.05% with a Voc of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 18.46 mA cm−2, and an FF of 62.49% when measured under reverse voltage scanning. Fig. 4 shows the histograms of the solar cell performance parameters, revealing clearly that the cells using LT-SnO2 ESLs have better reproducibility than the cells using HT-SnO2 ESLs. The efficiencies of the 30 cells using LT-SnO2 ESLs range from 14.99% to 16.05%. The efficiencies of the 30 cells using HT-SnO2 ESLs range from 8.90% to 11.05%. The cells using LT-SnO2 ESLs achieved an average Voc of 1.08 ± 0.01 V, a Jsc of 19.18 ± 0.29 mA cm−2, an FF of 73.78 ± 0.92%, and a PCE of 15.28 ± 0.26%, indicating good reproducibility. However, the cells using HT-SnO2 ESLs only achieved an average Voc of 0.97 ± 0.02 V, a Jsc of 17.61 ± 0.63 mA cm−2, an FF of 59.19 ± 2.03%, and a PCE of 10.10 ± 0.61%, which have lower average values with larger deviations.

We have conducted detailed structural, optical, electrical, and electrochemical characterizations to the previously described performance differences of the perovskite solar cells using LT-SnO2 and HT-SnO2 ESLs. These characterizations are discussed in greater detail in the following sections.
Structural characterization

Fig. 5 shows the top view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of LT- and HT-SnO2 films deposited on FTO substrates at different magnifications. Fig. 5a and b show that after low-temperature annealing, the FTO substrate is fully and uniformly covered with the dense SnO2 nanoparticles. However, after high-temperature annealing, the SnO2 nanoparticles agglomerated seriously, leaving many FTO areas uncovered by SnO2 (Fig. 5c and d). The bigger particles are the uncovered FTO grains, which are very similar to the bare FTO (Fig. S2†). The AFM images confirm that the HT-SnO2 film is rougher than the LT-SnO2 film (Fig. S3†). The root mean square roughness of LT- and HT-SnO2 films deposited on FTO substrates are 6.54 nm and 8.95 nm, respectively. The HT-SnO2 film is therefore not compact and cannot effectively block holes, leading to severe interface recombination and shunting paths. For the most part, this accounts for the observed performance differences: the cells using HT-SnO2 ESLs exhibited lower FFs, Voc's, and PCEs than the cells using LT-SnO2 ESLs. Despite increasing the HT-SnO2 film thickness to 100 nm, the film still does not appear to be as compact as that of the LT-SnO2 film due to particle agglomeration, however, the SnO2 nanoparticles appear to have increased in size (Fig. 5e and f). We have also investigated the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the LT- and HT-SnO2 films (Fig. S4†). To avoid the influence from FTO substrates, both LT- and HT-SnO2 were deposited on silicon substrates. It is seen that the HT-SnO2 film exhibits much better crystallinity than that of the LT-SnO2 film.

Optical characterization
To investigate the optical properties of LT- and HT-SnO2 ESLs, we prepared a LT-SnO2 film and a HT-SnO2 film on bare glass substrates. Fig. 6 shows the diagram of (αhν)2 against hν obtained from the transmission spectra. It clearly shows that the LT-SnO2 film exhibits a slightly wider band gap than that of the HT-SnO2 film—the band gaps of the LT-SnO2 film and the HT-SnO2 film are about 3.57 eV and 3.41 eV, respectively. This difference may be attributable to different degrees of quantum confinement. The HT-SnO2 film has larger nanoparticles and therefore smaller quantum confinement, which could be why the LT-SnO2 film showed a slightly better transmission than the HT-SnO2 film deposited on the FTO substrate (Fig. 2a). Because the conduction band edge of SnO2 is mainly derived from the rather delocalized Sn s states and the valence band edge is mainly derived from the relatively localized O p states, the effective mass for electrons is much smaller than that for holes.27 The stronger quantum confinement would lead to a higher conduction band edge.28 Therefore, the conduction band edge of the LT-SnO2 ESL matches more closely with the conduction band edge of the perovskite absorber than that of the HT-SnO2, which may also contribute to the observed higher Voc's for the cells using the LT-SnO2 ESLs compared to the cells using the HT-SnO2 ESLs.

Electrical characterization
To investigate the electrical properties, a LT-SnO2 film and a HT-SnO2 film deposited on bare glass substrates were characterized by Hall effect measurements. Table 2 shows the electrical resistivity, electron mobility, and carrier densities of LT-SnO2 and HT-SnO2 films. It shows that the HT-SnO2 film exhibits a higher free-electron density. These electrons may recombine with photogenerated holes at the SnO2/perovskite interface, leading to a lessened ability to block holes. The LT-SnO2 film exhibits a lower electron density, but much higher electron mobility, which is more effective at blocking holes.

Electrochemical characterization
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Voc decay measurements are widely used to investigate interface charge transport and recombination in perovskite solar cells and dye-sensitized solar cells.15,29–32Fig. 7 shows Nyquist plots of the perovskite solar cells using LT-SnO2 and HT-SnO2 ESLs. The inset in Fig. 7a shows the equivalent circuit for the cells. The series resistance (Rs) is equal to the value of the high-frequency intercept on the real axis.16 The main semicircle in the low frequency range in Fig. 7a can be mainly attributed to the capacitance and recombination resistance (Rrec) between the perovskite film and the ESL.16 The incomplete semicircle in the high frequency range in Fig. 7b can be mainly attributed to capacitance and transfer resistance (Rtrans).16 The Rtrans of the cell using LT-SnO2 ESL is slightly higher than that of the cell using HT-SnO2 ESL, as shown in Fig. 7b. The Rs of the cells using LT-SnO2 and HT-SnO2 ESLs are 6.56 and 5.66 Ω cm2, respectively. The slightly lower Rs and Rtrans can be mainly attributed to the fact that the LT-SnO2 ESL exhibits higher electrical resistivity and better film coverage. However, Fig. 7a shows that the Rrec of the cell using LT-SnO2 ESL is much higher than that of the cell using HT-SnO2 ESL. Therefore, the cell using LT-SnO2 ESL has a much lower interface recombination rate because of the LT-SnO2 film being more compact and having much higher electron mobility and lower carrier concentration than that of the HT-SnO2 ESL. Fig. S5† shows the Voc decay curves of the cells using LT-SnO2 and HT-SnO2 ESLs. The Voc decay relates to the charge carrier recombination rate and carrier lifetime in the devices.15,32 Fig. S5† clearly shows that the cell using LT-SnO2 ESL has a much longer Voc decay time than that of the cell using HT-SnO2 ESL. This indicates that the cell using LT-SnO2 ESL has a much longer carrier lifetime and, therefore, lower recombination rate than the cell using HT-SnO2 ESL. This result confirms that the cell using HT-SnO2 ESL exhibits more serious interface recombination than the cell using LT-SnO2 ESL.

Conclusions
In summary, we have compared the performance of perovskite solar cells using LT-SnO2 and HT-SnO2 ESLs. We have shown that the perovskite solar cells using LT-SnO2 ESLs perform much better than the cells using HT-SnO2 ESLs. Our detailed characterizations revealed the origin of the performance difference: LT-SnO2 ESLs have much better film coverage, higher electron mobility, and wider band gap than those of HT-SnO2 ETLs, accounting for higher PCEs, Jsc's, FFs, and Voc's. LT-SnO2 ESLs provide an opportunity for fabrication of efficient perovskite solar cells on flexible substrates.
