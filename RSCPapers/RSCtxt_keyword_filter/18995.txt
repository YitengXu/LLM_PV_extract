    , Accepted 6th May 2012First published on 9th May 2012AbstractPerylenediimide functionalized bridged siloxane nanoparticles were prepared by direct hydrolysis and condensation of a perylenediimide silane precursor in the presence of a catalytic amount of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). The sizes of the particles were controlled by adjusting organotrialkoxysilane, base, and TEOS concentrations. Using this modified Stöber method, we were able to incorporate a higher load of organic content (∼70%) into the siloxane core compared to typical organically modified Stöber silica nanoparticles. The size, shape, and surface morphology of these functionalized particles were visualized using transmission electron microscopy. Their compositions were confirmed by FTIR, thermogravimetric analysis, and elemental analysis. The photovoltaic performance of these nanohybrids in the poly(3-hexylthiophene) polymer matrix was evaluated. The device made from a sample annealed at 150 °C showed reasonably good photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency of 1.56% under standard test conditions of AM 1.5G spectra at an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
Introduction
Hybrid nanostructures derived from silica or siloxanes have been the focus of intense research due to the unique possibilities to combine the properties of the organic moieties with those of the siloxane or silica matrix.1–3 Reliable synthesis of such hybrid particles over a wide range of size (2 to 100 nm) but with narrow average size distributions would provide unique opportunities to tailor functionalized organic ligands ranging in size from small molecules to polymers. The use of ligand-functionalized nanoparticles in applications is impeded, however, by the difficulty of tailoring a wide variety of ligands to the nanoparticle surface and the difficulty of dispersion in specific polymer matrices.
Recent research on organosilica hybrids has provided examples of tailoring various types of organic moieties onto particles for a wide variety of applications.1–3 Such organosilica particles and their bulk materials have potential applications as nano-fillers in polymer systems for use in adhesives, coatings, composites, and dental fillings.3 Significant advances have been made towards their use in fuel cells, optic devices, and sensors.2–4 Recently, a few research groups have developed methods to prepare functionalized organosilicas for optoelectronic applications.1d,6,7 For example, significant advances have been made in incorporating polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) cages into organic light emitting materials.8–10 Conjugated polymers functionalized with silsesquioxane cages have shown improved thermal and color stability, higher brightness, and improved quantum efficiencies compared to polymers alone.10 Indeed, only a few reports describe surface functionalized electronically active silica nanoparticles for photovoltaic applications.11 Senkovskyy et al. have recently introduced a novel surface initiated grafting method to graft regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene), P3HT, from surface modified silica particles and evaluated the resulting photovoltaic properties by blending with a derivative of fullerene C60 (PCBM).11 These nano-P3HT particles in combination with PCBM showed a reasonably good photovoltaic performance with overall power conversion efficiency of 1.8–2.3%.11 Nonetheless, it is highly desirable to develop methods to prepare electronically active ligand-functionalized siloxane nanohybrids in terms of their potential applications in optoelectronic devices including organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs).
In this work, we have developed a suitable method to make electronically active ligand-functionalized siloxane nanoparticles, having controllable sizes ranging from 30 to 200 nm. The usual method used to prepare organosilica hybrids is the well-known hydrolytic sol–gel route, which involves base- or acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and condensation reactions of monomeric alkoxysilane precursors in aqueous solvent systems.1 In addition to the hydrolytic sol–gel route, a number of approaches have been developed in recent years, including a modified Stöber sol–gel route, a non-hydrolytic sol–gel route, and miniemulsion polymerization techniques.5 The direct hydrolysis and condensation of dye-functionalized organotrialkoxysilane is one of the most effective ways to incorporate a higher load of fluorescent dyes to a silica core1a when compared to the ligand density of organically modified silica, which is less than 20%.6 Moreover, this method provides opportunities to introduce more organic properties to an inorganic matrix with retained 3-D architecture in solution rather than nanoparticle aggregation, which is usually observed in the typical surface modified Stöber silica nanoparticles.12 The organic functional groups of these hybrids can fulfill two functions, including modification of the inorganic core and resulting in improved compatibility with a host matrix.1a Moreover, the introduction of both reactive organic groups and fluorescent molecules to a siloxane network may expand the scope of grafting/ligand chemistry.
In recent years, substituted perylenediimides (PDIs) have been studied extensively as a major class of organic semiconductors which serve as both acceptors and n-type semiconductors.13 Functionalized PDI derivatives show unique optoelectronic properties due to the formation of supramolecular architectures via noncovalent intermolecular interactions between the extended π-conjugation.14 Novel PDI derivative-substituted donor systems synthesized for efficient energy and charge transfer studies have been reported for oligo(p-phenylenevinylene)s,15 oligo(p-phenylene)s,16 oligothiophenes,17 oligopyrroles,18 oligofluorenes,19 porphyrin,20 and phthalocyanine.21 However, there are only a few published reports on incorporation of PDI derivatives into silica or siloxane networks with no evaluation of their photovoltaic performances.22
In this article, we describe the preparation of PDI-functionalized bridged siloxanes and their potential applicability as an acceptor for organic photovoltaic devices. As depicted in Scheme 1, these fluorescent nanohybrids were prepared by base-catalyzed hydrolysis, and condensation of a PDI-silane precursor in the presence of a catalytic amount of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS, 0.05–0.75 equivalent with respect to silane precursor) and ammonium hydroxide in anhydrous ethanol.

Through this method, PDI-functionalized bridged siloxanes (PDIB-NPs) were prepared, isolated, and characterized. The photophysical properties of the nanoparticles and the blends of PDIB-NPs–P3HT were studied in both solution and solid phase. The I–V curves for the test devices were obtained for a 1:1 mixture of PDIB-NP–P3HT blends after being annealed at different annealing temperatures ranging from 50 °C to 150 °C and the power conversion efficiency was evaluated.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
Perylenediimide derivative functionalized bridged-siloxane nanoparticles (PDIB-NPs) were prepared by adapting the modified Stöber method.12 The synthetic steps for the preparation of the disilane precursor and its respective fluorescent hybrids are depicted in Scheme 1. Starting from 3,4,9,10-tetracarboxyanhydrideperylene, the PDI silane precursor (1) was synthesized following the published procedure.23 In a typical procedure, nanoparticles were prepared by base-catalyzed hydrolysis and condensation of the silane precursor in the presence of 5–7.5 mol% TEOS. While the particle size is controlled by the molar ratios of the silane precursor to NH4OH to TEOS, slow drop feeding of the monomer into the reaction and the addition of TEOS controls the particle regularity. In each trial, the reaction conditions were evaluated in order to develop a procedure that would be best suited for the production of a wide size range of nanoparticles with a narrow polydispersity. Since we started from a di-triethoxysilane precursor, perylenediimide units interconnect via a bridge of siloxane network, while co-condensing and hydrolyzing the triethoxysilane moiety to form the siloxane core. Unlike surface functionalized Stöber silica nanoparticles, functionalized silsesquioxane nanoparticles do not need to be stored in solution to avoid the particle aggregation.12 These particles are able to be stored as a dry solid and redispersed in most organic solvents with little sonication (Fig. 1).

Table 1 summarizes the best-suited amount of silane precursor, NH4OH and TEOS used, and particle size distribution of each trial. It is shown that the base concentration affects the particle sizes. In this manner, we were able to control the particle size over a range from 30 to 200 nm. We performed a series of multiple trial reactions to study the effects of the base concentration on the particles' size distributions at the fixed molar ratios of other reagents. The effects of base concentration on the particle size distribution are presented in Fig. 2a. In general, nanoparticles obtained at low base concentrations were larger than those made at higher levels. The effect of base concentration on particle size distribution was previously studied and reported for the preparation of silsesquioxane nanoparticles from organotriethoxy silanes using a modified Stöber method.1e,1f Generally, an increase in hydrolysis rates with increasing ammonia and water concentration leads to a higher nucleation rate, which results in a larger number of particles in a smaller size range.1e,1f We have observed a similar effect on particle size distribution with increasing the amount of base and water used. The highest base concentration resulted in 30–50 nm particles, and lower base concentrations resulted in larger sized nanoparticles in the range of 90 nm to 200 nm. We have also successfully applied this developed experimental procedure to prepare P3HT-functionalized siloxane nanoparticles (Fig. 3) and this work is currently in progress.

The FT-IR spectra (Fig. 2b) of the particles confirmed the presence of characteristic bands for the formation of Si–O–Si bonds and the retention of Si–C linkages during the base-catalyzed hydrolysis and condensation reactions. The alkyl chains –CH and diimide carbonyl stretching vibrations were observed at 2933–2856 and 1694 cm−1, respectively. The presence of aromatic C–C stretchings (1595–1654 cm−1) and N–C vibrations (1442 cm−1) further supports the successful incorporation of perylenediimide units into a siloxane network. The silsesquioxanes exhibited a well-defined absorption at 1345–1403 cm−1, indicating the presence of Si–C bonds in Si–PDI units. The absorption of Si–O–Si was seen at 1062 cm−1, evidencing the formation of a siloxane network. Thermogravimetric data analysis (TGA) confirms the higher load of ligand incorporation (∼70%) into the siloxane network (see ESI, S1†). However, carbon and hydrogen content obtained from the elemental analysis of PDIB-NPs are 0.5% and 0.6% higher than the calculated contents of carbon and hydrogen. This may be due to the incorporation of unhydrolysed residual ethoxy groups and co-condensation of a trace amount of TEOS with a PDI-silane precursor, while forming the siloxane network. As previously reported in the literature,1g the incomplete condensation of organotrialkoxy silanes yields unhydrolysed alkoxy groups and Si–OH groups incorporated into the fully condensed structural formula, which showed variation in carbon and hydrogen content.1g Since in our case, the difference of carbon and hydrogen contents is less than 1%, we did not count the excess carbon and hydrogen content to obtain the fully condensed structural formula of R–(SiO1.5)x. Overall, the %total of organic (C, H, N) and inorganic (Si and O, including oxygen from PDI ligands) contents obtained from the elemental analysis were in reasonable agreement with the calculated percentage values and confirm that the siloxane core is a silsesquioxane network with the formula R–Si2O3 where R is C30H20N2O4.
Particle morphology and size distribution
The size and the shape of the nanoparticles were visualized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The morphology of these particles is shown in Fig. 3, which demonstrates the successful preparation of these novel electronically active nanoparticles. It is also clear from these images that the particles are spherical in shape and mostly monodisperse. The particle size distribution and the particle diameter were estimated using EDS 2000, 2.6 software (see Experimental section for details) and are shown in ESI (Fig. S2†). It is shown that the particle size distribution was very narrow and mostly resulted monodisperse, spherical nanoparticles at higher base concentration. This may be due to the effect of a high nucleation rate at higher base concentration, which regulates the particle size polydispersity.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis
To gain insight into the molecular orientation and packing of perylenediimide units within the siloxane core structure, we performed XRD-analysis of the PDIB-NPs and the precursor 1. As shown in Fig. 4, most of the diffraction peaks of the PDIB-NPs overlap with that of the PDI-silane precursor. However, the diffraction signals of PDIB-NPs are broad and weak except for the primary peak. Both XRD patterns show a similar molecular packing pattern with multiple orders of (00l) peaks, where (l = 1, 2, 3, 4, …). The molecular packing order examined here is similar to the highly ordered lamellar stacks of perylenediimide-bridged silsesquioxane tubular structures described by Yan Luo and co-workers.24 The XRD profile of PDIB-NPs shows a primary peak with a d-spacing of 2.62 nm, which is 0.32 nm smaller compared to a d-spacing value of 2.94 nm reported by Yan Luo et al.24

Photophysical studies
The UV/VIS-absorption and photoluminescence studies of PDIB-NPs were performed to understand the molecular organization of perylenediimide units within the siloxane network. In order to find an optimal blending composition for complete energy transfer from regioregular P3HT to PDIB-NPs, the solution and solid phase fluorescence studies of PDIB-NPs–P3HT mixtures with different %weight of PDIB-NPs were also performed.
PDIB-NPs
The photophysical properties of PDIB-NPs were studied in chloroform solution. As depicted in Fig. 5a, the solution phase absorption spectra of PDIB-1 and PDIB-4 exhibit typical spectral characteristics similar to the PDI-bridged silane monomer 1 with three characteristic vibronic bands of the S0–S1 transitions at 470, 495 and 530 nm.25 However, the absorbance spectrum of PDIB-2 shows an unresolved broad peak at 495 nm with a shoulder at around 530 nm. The PL spectra of PDIB-NPs in solution show the expected λmax at 534 nm with well-resolved vibronic bands at 574 nm and 625 nm (Fig. 5b). These spectral patterns of PDIB-NPs agree well with the spectral pattern of its monomer with well-resolved emission vibronic bands.

Blends of PDIB-NPs–P3HT
Thin film fluorescence emission spectra of three different blends of PDIB-NPs–P3HT were obtained by photoexcitation using the 457 nm and 514 nm output from an Ar ion laser and detection using an EMCCD camera. Representative spectra are shown in Fig. 6. The blend compositions used were 25%, 50% and 75% (w/w) of PDIB-NPs prepared from a 100 fold diluted solution of 2 mg mL−1 of PDIB-NPs in a 1:1 mixture of chloroform and ethanol solution. The emission spectra of all three blends show three distinct well-resolved vibronic bands, which are in good agreement with the solution phase emission of the PDIB-NPs. Complete quenching of the P3HT emission by the PDIB-NPs could occur as a result of either direct energy transfer or charge transfer from P3HT to the PDIB-NPs. The latter pathway is illustrated in Fig. 7 and was previously observed in similar systems.26

 Fig. 7  Possible pathway of electron transfer from P3HT to the PDI-NPs. When electron transfer occurs, emission from P3HT is quenched. 
In order to further investigate the possibility that electron transfer is responsible for the fluorescence quenching observed in the thin film studies, we examined the photoluminescence behavior of P3HT and PDIB-NP mixtures in chloroform solutions with increasing PDIB-NP concentration by (w/w) of 10%, 25%, 50%, and 75%. As depicted in Fig. 8, the fluorescence intensities gradually increased with PDIB-NP concentration except for the 10% (w/w) blend. The P3HT emission decreased almost by half at the 10% (w/w) PDIB concentration, which suggests fluorescence quenching via energy transfer from P3HT to PDIB-NPs. At the concentration of 25% (w/w) PDIB-NP composition, the emission intensity increased by three fold compared to the 10% (w/w) blend. The increase of emission observed here is mainly due to the increase of direct excitation of PDIB units and resultant emission from the perylenediimide excited state as previously suggested by S. Tagawa et al.26 This indicates that the small effect of energy transfer takes place in solution in the presence of less than 25% (w/w) of PDIB-NP concentration. However, emission from both higher concentrations of PDIB-NP compositions shows considerably higher intensities with well-resolved vibronic features, which is similar to PDIB-NP emission. The spectral shift and the features of the spectra observed for solution blends at above 25% (w/w) are in good agreement with those obtained for the thin film blends (Fig. 6), suggesting that a considerable amount of P3HT excited states are quenched, even in the solution. These results further support the hypothesis that an electron transfer process is responsible for fluorescence quenching in these thin film blends, as previously observed by Saeki et al.26
 Fig. 8  Fluorescence emission spectra of P3HT–PDIB-NP blend in a solution of chloroform; excited at 457 nm. 
As the overall concentration of the thin film blends is increased, emission from P3HT excimers starts to become evident and even dominates at high overall concentrations as shown in Fig. 9a. Concentrated thin films prepared from 2 mg mL−1 solutions of P3HT and PDIB-NPs also exhibit a diversity of behavior depending upon the region of the thin film interrogated, as shown in Fig. 9b. Spectra in Fig. 9b were acquired from areas approximately 20 × 20 μm2 and demonstrate that depending on the local morphology of higher concentration blends, P3HT excimer emission is quite large, despite the fact that P3HT monomer emission is not evident. For example, at 75% (w/w) P3HT and 25% (w/w) PDIB-NP composition, excimer emission of P3HT dominates rather than PDIB-NP emission. This would suggest incomplete electron transfer from P3HT to PDIB-NPs with the excimer emission being stabilized.

During these studies we have found that although excimer emission from pure P3HT polymer photobleaches very rapidly (50% within 10 seconds, shown in Fig. 9c), the excimer emission was stable for much longer time (>50% at 500 seconds) in the concentrated blends with PDIB-NPs or the PDIB monomer (Fig. 9d). However, at this point we have not performed further studies to examine the effect of PDIB-NP concentration on the excimer emission of P3HT.
Photovoltaic properties of the PDIB-nanoparticles
Derivatives of PDI are good candidates as acceptors for bulk heterojunction OPVs due to the high electron mobility, which is as high as 1.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for liquid-crystalline PDIs at room temperature.27 However, recent work on bulk heterojunction devices made from blends of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and derivatives of PDI exhibit low external power conversion efficiencies, generally just below 0.2%.26a,28 The formation of micrometer-sized PDI crystals upon annealing is a possibility for low external power conversion.28 Our intention here is to improve power conversion while avoiding the formation of micrometer-sized PDI domains. We used nano-sized crystalline PDI nanohybrids and evaluated the PV performance of the blends of PDIB-NPs and the regioregular P3HT polymer (Mn = 30000–60000 g mol−1). Another goal of this work is to test if there is any adverse effect on PV performance on incorporation of PDI units into the siloxane network. However, in the present work we did not intend to study the effect of the architecture–property relationship but rather aimed at confirming whether the silsesquioxane core structure of PDIB hybrids is able to improve the PV performance of the PDI–P3HT blend.
Bulk heterojunction solar cells with the configurations ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca–Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al were fabricated29 to investigate the photovoltaic properties of the silsesquioxane nanoparticles. The various device parameters including annealing conditions and compositions of the active layer blends were optimized (Fig. 10 and 11). As shown in Fig. 10, the I–V curves of the devices annealed at different annealing temperatures show a gradual increase in current density. We were able to obtain devices with a Voc of 0.53 V, a Jsc of 6.88 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.42 ± 0.02, when devices were annealed at 150 °C (Fig. 10a). This optimal device performance was obtained for the device made from a 1:1 mixture of P3HT and PDIB-1 nanoparticles with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend/Ca–Al. However, when the cathode of test devices was changed to LiF/Al, the resulting Jsc and Voc were considerably low (Fig. 11a and Table S1†).

The device performance of 1:2 mixtures of P3HT and PDIB-1 devices resulted in lower Voc and Jsc values (Fig. 11b and Table S1†). The differences of current densities for 1:1 and 1:2 compositions of P3HT–PDIB-1 agree with solution and solid phase photoluminescence studies of different compositions of the blends (Fig. 6 and 8). The solid state PL spectrum of the 1:1 blend (Fig. 6b) likely explains the improved Jsc and power conversion efficiency, consistent with the posited explanation of complete energy transfer from P3HT to PDI units compared to 1:2 blend compositions. Although we observed excimer emission in different local morphologies of concentrated thin films (Fig. 9), we did not see any adverse effect on device performance parameters from the active layer local morphology. However, further studies on the active layer morphology are necessary to understand the excimer emission effect for device performance.
The fill factor obtained is lower by 0.11 over the devices (FF = 0.51) that have been reported using bulk materials of P3HT–PDI blends.28a The fill factor describes the quality of the diode and is mainly influenced by the series and shunt resistances.30 In our case, we have noticed that the overall resistances for test devices were considerably high with the output resistance in the range of 200–300 Ω. This may be a possible reason for the low value of the fill factor. However, we were able to improve the current density of P3HT–PDIB-NPs blends by five fold with a power conversion efficiency of 1.56 ± 0.06%, which represents a near three fold improvement in performance over previously reported P3HT-block-PDI copolymer solar cells.28a These results demonstrate the beneficial effects of having nano-sized crystalline particles of PDI with silsesquioxane structure on device performance.
To clarify the origin of the improved efficiency, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) for the devices made from 1:1 P3HT–PDIB-NP blends were measured upon monochromatic illumination with a power intensity of 100 mW cm−2 in the 400–750 nm region (see the Experimental section for EQE analysis). The test device with a 1:1 P3HT–PDIB-NP blend reached a maximum of 18% EQE at 440 nm (Fig. 12). The EQE is improved across a broad spectral range from 400–650 nm with pronounced difference at the short wavelength region, where the PDIB-NPs absorb most strongly. The maximum EQE reported for bulk P3HT–PDI blends with the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend/LiF/Al was 19%, which is 1% higher than the external quantum efficiency obtained for our devices with the configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend/Ca–Al.28

Although more studies are necessary to comprehensively establish the influence of the bridged silsesquioxane structure and the particle morphology on PV performance, it is clear that the crystalline lamella packing of PDI units within the siloxane core structure has some adverse effect on enhancing the PV performance. In future studies, we will focus on possibilities of tuning charge-transport and self-assembly properties of PDIB-nanoparticles using our approach: (i) by a variation of particle size and shape and (ii) by introducing both P3HT and PDI moieties to the silsesquioxane core structure.
Experimental
Materials
3,4,9,10-Tetracarboxyanhydrideperylene, regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (average Mn 30000–60000 g mol−1), tert-butylmagnesium chloride (1 M in THF), and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran were obtained from Aldrich Chemicals. Ammonium hydroxide (28%) was obtained from Fischer Scientific. Tetraethoxysilane and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane were purchased from Alfa Aesar and used as received. Unless otherwise specified, all chemicals were used as received.
Characterization
Proton NMR spectra were recorded on a 500 MHz JEOL using CDCl3 as a solvent. FTIR spectra were measured using a Perkin-Elmer Spectrum One FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a universal ATR sampling accessory. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations were performed on a 100CX JEOL at 80 keV. Thermogravimetric analysis was performed at Thermal Analysis Laboratory at Western Kentucky University. The samples were analyzed by a TA Q5000TGA. The samples were held isothermal at room temperature for 30 min and then heated from room temperature to 650 °C at 10 °C min−1 in nitrogen. The purge gas was heated at 10 °C min−1 to 800 °C. The elemental compositions (C, H, and N, Si) of the silane precursor (1) and the PDIB-NPs were analyzed by Micro-Elemental Analysis Lab at Advanced Materials Institute, Western Kentucky University. The photophysical properties in solution were performed on a fluorescence spectrometer (Perkin Elmer LS 55) and a UV-visible spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, Lambda 35). Thin films were prepared by spin coating the blends onto cleaned glass coverslips to give a film thickness of ∼80 to 100 nm. The 457 and 514 laser lines from a Coherent Innova 200 Ar ion laser were used to excite the thin films with a typical excitation power of 100 μW. A Nikon TE2000U inverted microscope with a 100× 1.4 NA oil immersion objective was employed for laser excitation and also for collection of the emitted light. Spectra were dispersed using a Princeton Instruments 2150 spectrograph (300 grooves per mm grating) and detected using a Princeton Instruments ProEM EMCCD camera (1024 × 1024 pixels). To reduce filter effects on the resulting spectra, a mirror rather than a dichroic filter was employed for excitation of the sample and either a long pass filter (for 457 nm excitation) or a 514 nm notch filter was employed in the collection of the emitted light.

To a two-necked round bottom flask, 3,4,9,10-tetracarboxyanhydrideperylene (1.0 g, 2.24 mmol) and excess 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, 3-APT (3 mL) were added and heated at 120 °C for three hours under argon atmosphere. The resulted red thick solid was washed with hexane to remove excess 3-APT. The red solid was dissolved in THF (∼20 mL) and insoluble solid was removed by gravity filtration. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuum to yield a red solid (850 mg, yield = 57%). 1H-NMR in CDCl3 {δ, ppm}: 8.64 (2H, d), 8.57 (2H, d), 4.20 (4H, t), 3.82 (12H, q), 1.87 (4H, m), 1.21 (18H, t), 0.79 (4H, t); FT-IR stretchings (cm−1): 2943–2881 (C–H stretching of alkyl chains), around 1693 (carbonyl stretching), 1594–1654 (aromatic C–C stretchings), 1440 (N–C stretching from perylenediimide), 1342–1254 (Si–C stretchings) and 1075 (Si–O–); elemental analysis (%): experimental – C 63.15, H 6.33, N 3.49; Calculated – C 63.13, H 6.31, N 3.51.
Typical procedure for the preparation of PDIB nanoparticles
Ammonium hydroxide (28% in water, 10 mL, 80 mmol) and TEOS (5 μL, 0.012 mmol) were added into a 250 mL flask containing 200 mL of anhydrous ethanol. Then the PDI silane monomer (191 mg, 0.24 mmol) in THF (5 mL) was slowly added to the reaction mixture and stirred for about 24 hours at room temperature. With time, the reaction mixture turned to a cloudy suspension. The nanoparticles were isolated by repeated centrifugation, and redispersion in ethanol, then dried under a stream of air, to obtain the particles as a red powder (171 mg, 89%, average size ∼30 nm); FTIR (cm−1): 2933–2856 (C–H stretching of alkyl chains), around 1693 (carbonyl stretching), 1595–1654 (aromatic C–C stretchings), 1442 (weak, N–C stretching from perylenediimide), 1345 (Si–C stretchings) and 1062 (Si–O–Si stretching from a siloxane network); TGA: 69% weight loss at 430 °C and residue %weight 29.12%. Elemental analysis (%): experimental – C 63.03, H 4.10, N 4.75, Si 9.80; calculated – C 62.48, H 3.50, N 4.86, Si 9.74.
Particle size distribution
In a typical procedure, particles were dissolved in chloroform (∼2 mg mL−1) and drop cast on a carbon-coated copper grid. The sample was air-dried and visualized under TEM and images were obtained under the same area of 7 × 11 cm2. The scale marker (size of the grid × magnification = size on negative film) of 200 nm (obtained from the ruler grid, scanned under the same number of pixels as that of a negative film scan) was placed on the image file. Then the images were imported into EDS 2000, version 2.6 software, and the particle analysis was performed to get the particle diameter distribution on the basis of size (under the assumption that all of the particles are spherical in shape). The output file was imported into Microcal Origin 6.0 and plotted to determine the exact size distribution.
Device preparation and characterization
Model bulk heterojunction solar cell devices were prepared on glass/ITO substrates. The substrates were subsequently cleaned in 2-propanol and acetone in an ultrasonic bath for 10 minutes each and a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS (purchased from Aldrich) with a thickness of ∼70 to 80 nm was spin coated as a hole transporting layer on top of ITO under nitrogen atmosphere. The substrates were heated at 100 °C in a vacuum oven for an hour. As a first step, the active layer of PDIB-NPs:P3HT (average Mn = 30000–60000 g mol−1) with two different ratios (1:1 and 2:1) dissolved in chlorobenzene (15 mg mL−1 concentration of each compound for the 1:1 blend) was spin coated at a rotational speed of 1000 rpm to give a film thickness of 80–100 nm. The casting of the active layer on the substrate was carried out inside a glove box under nitrogen atmosphere. The substrates were transported into a vacuum evaporator and a layer of calcium (∼80 nm) and Al (∼200 nm) was thermally evaporated on top of the active layer with a diameter of 2 × 6 mm of coating area through a mask. The final devices were annealed inside the glove box at different temperatures for ten minutes followed by transfer to a glass chamber under stream of nitrogen gas and the chamber was sealed for device characterization. The testing of the devices was performed using a solar simulator with an emission spectrum close to AM 1.5G and an intensity of 100 W m−2. The I–V curves of the devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter controlled by a PC. The fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) were calculated manually using the following two equations:  where Ps is the intensity of light.
The external quantum efficiencies for test devices were obtained by measuring the photocurrent at zero bias voltage with respect to the wavelength ranging from 400 to 750 nm under the power intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The EQE for each wavelength was calculated using the following equation as described in the literature.30
IPCE (EQE%) = 1240 × ISC/λ × PIn where λ [nm] is the incident photon wavelength, ISC [mA cm−2] is the photocurrent of the device and PIn [mW cm−2] is the incident power.
Conclusions
We have described the synthesis, photophysical properties, and photovoltaic performance of electronically active siloxane nanoparticles prepared by base catalyzed hydrolysis and condensation. It has been shown that this approach is very useful in incorporating a higher content of organic dyes into the silsesquioxane network to obtain highly fluorescent acceptor functionalized nanoparticles. This approach is also clearly not limited to specific ligands, but could be applied broadly across any appropriately functionalized silane precursor to make hybrid nanostructures of various sizes and compositions. These findings will further open new routes to make reactive group functionalized fluorescent hybrids which are useful in grafting chemistry. We were able to enhance device performance of the blends of PDIB nanohybrids with P3HT by threefold for optimized devices with an efficiency of 1.56%. Further studies aimed at improving power conversion efficiency of P3HT–PDIB-NP blends with different sizes of PDIB nanohybrids are in progress.
