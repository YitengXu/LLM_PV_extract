    , Accepted 25th March 2020First published on 30th March 2020AbstractRecent developments in miniaturized electronic devices with sophisticated computational capabilities and remarkably low power communication technologies involve a tendency toward powering these devices with long cycle life, high energy efficiency, fast and cheap production and lightweight power sources. Integration of piezoelectric materials and novel fabrication techniques with conventional textile processes established the emergence of a wearable technology field which can fulfill this purpose. Mechanical energy harvesters are required for multiple applications such as structural health monitoring systems, self-powered wireless sensors, and harvesting energy from body movements inexpensively. Among the variety of materials exhibiting piezoelectricity, polymers are more considered due to their many excellent properties desirable in flexible piezoelectric generators. Hence, fiber-based electronic devices have the best features for human garments such as flexibility, stretchability, permeability and lightweight, and they are ideal interface platform options between the environment, electronic devices and human body. Hence, this article starts with the fundamentals of wearable technology and materials involved and then reviews recent developments in fiber-based self-powered systems and sensors with the special focus on the piezoelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride) polymer and barium titanium oxide ceramic. In addition, a number of strategies that may improve the piezoelectric generator performance are summarized. Furthermore, the global textile market industry and the high-performance end-user such as washability and durability were reviewed. Potential difficulties, challenges and opportunities in the field of fiber-based energy generators are also explored.Fatemeh MokhtariFatemeh Mokhtari is a PhD student in the Intelligent Polymer Research Institute (IPRI) at the University of Wollongong, Australia.

1. Introduction
Industrialisation approaches create new incorporative fields such as Internet of Things (IoT),30 robotics, artificial intelligence (AI) and big data.37 The IoT is a system of interrelated computing devices which comprises everyday objects, such as medical technology, mobile phones, laptops, and other electronic devices, and perhaps one day, it will even include ordinary things such as clothing and furniture.44 Electronic textiles (e-textile) are poised to play an important role in the IoT development to connect a larger number of objects to each other and to the cloud.10 The technological growth of these devices may revolutionize our world and daily lives in the near future and hence providing energy for these electronics attracts research attention. Power sources for these devices are normally rechargeable batteries. These power source have the limitation such as periodic charging times, minimal life-cycle, potential hazard, high-priced disposal and significant environmental risks48 so they may not be the most appropriate power source for future electronic devices. Therefore, many efforts have been made to find renewable, environmentally friendly and green energy sources to power up electronic devices.49–51 There are various green energy sources including solar,52 wind,53 acoustic and radio waves,54,55 heat,56,57 and vibrations.58 These renewable energy harvesting systems attract attention in the research area of renewable and sustainable energy harvesters due to the rapid spread of wireless electronics.59 Most of the devices developed during the past decade just had a single source for energy harvesting. However, recently, there has been increasing interest in multi-source hybrid energy harvesting.60 Despite the possibility of all these energy harvesters, they are negatively influenced by external factors such as temperature, sunlight and weather conditions affecting their performance.37 Energy harvesting from body movements and the surrounding environment can potentially fulfill such a goal due to ubiquitous availability. Human body movement is an enormous storehouse of energy. The human body produces abundant energy from the mechanical movements of jumping, walking, and running and organ motions like respiration and heartbeat.61 Harvesting mechanical energy from large scale body movements, particularly at joints like the knee and elbow, involves complex deformations of devices in multimodal straining modes such as bending, twisting, pressing, and multiaxial stretching. At the same time, they require not only flexibility but also stretchability, which are both essential for efficient energy conversion.19 Body movement as a power source can be considered as an attractive alternative to traditional rechargeable batteries to supply electrical power to low-energy devices such as wearable electronics and body worn sensors.4 The power from a 68 kg adult's daily activities such as heating, breathing, blood circulation, arm motion, walking and typing could reach over 100 W for, and thus converting 1% of this power may be sufficient to charge portable electronics.62 Clothing is one of the basic necessities of human life; it is considered as the second skin and is the only wearable that adjusts to our everyday lifestyle over the course of a lifetime. Textiles represent a strong candidate to become the next interface between the real and the digital world.63 Textiles, due to their unique properties of light weight, soft nature, natural micro-structure, wearable convenience, and air permeability, are an ideal candidate for wearable applications.64 The emergence of wearable devices could potentially improve the quality of human life owing to their applications in healthcare monitoring,65 smart fabrics,66 motion tracking, roll-up displays,67 and wearable heaters.68 Although the first generation of such smart textiles only uses textiles as substrates for rigid and miniaturized electronic components, intrinsically flexible and wearable sensors directly use fabrics as functional materials for a seamless integration of multi-functional sensors and textiles.64 There are three different research categories which attract considerable attention in the area of wearable energy harvesting. First, applying energy harvesting materials in different forms such as fibers or yarn,45 two69,70 and three-dimensional71,72 fabric and film structure.73 These provide different performances in the case of flexibility, stretchability and appropriate integration of active materials and electrodes. Second, using polymers and a diverse range of fillers which enhance the output power, higher energy conversion efficiency and sensitivity of e-textiles.74,75 Third, the integration of wearable energy-harvesting with energy-storage devices which is an attractive route that creates new opportunities for empowering wearable electronics sustainably.76 These devices have lighter weight, longer operational time and less frequent recharging which bring convenience for consumers.77 Since the 1990s the field of energy harvesting has been studied, and the technological progress in this field has accelerated, especially in the last few years.78 Many devices such as electromagnetic,79 piezoelectric,80 and triboelectric81 energy harvesting devices have been shown to convert body movement energy into electricity, which can be used to power various wearable and implantable electronics.61 Each energy resource has its own advantages in particular environments. Among them, the piezoelectric energy harvesting technology has particularly attracted attention because of its high energy density characteristics.82 Piezoelectric materials convert mechanical energy into electricity through a mechanical-to-electrical transformation mechanism.83 Piezoelectric materials simply can be divided into four classifications: single crystals, ceramics, polymers, and composites (polymer/ceramic combination). Among them, piezo ceramics generally suffer from brittle and rigid properties that fail to satisfy the design of flexible wearable electronic devices.84 Over years, many attempts have been made to achieve a high performance of piezoelectric generators, which is generally affected by both intrinsic (crystal structure,85 piezoelectric coefficient,86 geometry effect,85 arrangement,87etc.) and extrinsic (frequency,88 applied pressure,89 poling effect,90 external load, etc.) parameters.91 Ferroelectric polymer materials such as poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) and its copolymers are well known for their piezoelectric properties. Despite their lower piezoelectric coefficients than their inorganic counterparts, they are flexible and can tolerate higher mechanical strain.92,93 The polar β-phase in PVDF is an essential parameter for efficient energy-harvesting applications.94 Addition of functional nanomaterials (TiO2,95 Fe-rGO,96 BiVO4 (ref. 97)) into the PVDF matrix is a novel approach that interrupts the PVDF symmetry structure and leads to the formation of a polar crystalline β-phase and consequently enhances the ferroelectric properties. Also, fundamental nanomaterials with high piezoelectric properties (PZT,98 BTO,99 NaNbO3 (ref. 100)) have been added into the PVDF matrix to increase the overall piezo response.101 PVDF offers a wide diversity of fabrication methods including, solvent-casting,39 melt-casting,102 fiber extrusion,103 electrospinning104 and phase-inversion.105 However, one of the main challenges for all these materials and methods is to transform them into appropriate textile structures to sustain the basic properties of fabrics, such as flexibility and wearability. Electrospun fibers are aligned along length axes and there is no need for the poling process due to the high electric field applied during fabrication but still the process is quite tedious and expensive.104,106 Flexible film based material devices can be stretched and bent in one direction. But their lack of low damage tolerance, air-permeability, and poor 3D deformation limit their application, specifically for wearable applications.107 Therefore, piezoelectric fiber based generators are in high demand. Fiber-based flexible generators can be integrated into textile products such as shoe insoles, trousers and clothing designed to harvest energy from daily activities.3 Early research about textile generators was performed with a simple woven structure that can apply force or tensile stress onto piezoelectric yarns.108 Recently, textile designs, such as knitted,13 braided,46 and coiled structures109 and 3D printed fabrics110 have been used to fabricate wearable piezoelectric textiles. The development of piezoelectric fibers or yarns leads to the development of piezoelectric textiles. The one-dimensional nature of piezoelectric fibers providing tailorable mechanical properties and chain alignment which present piezoelectric properties and a high degree of crystallinity.111 The energy units (fiber/fabric) for smart garments must be able to be cut in different lengths/shapes to meet versatile integration requirements. Hence, tailorability is an essential property not only for fiber fabrication into textiles but also for textiles being designed into clothes with different sizes and styles.112
In this regard, various scientific papers have been published on this subject to cover a wide range of all-fiber generators mostly in the area of triboelectric generators40,113–115 but less work is done in the case of piezoelectric all-fiber based generators.28,46,116 In this review we point out basic classifications and working principles. We also cover recent developments in material selection, fabrication techniques and structural design in wearable technology. We explore recent accomplishments in the ferroelectric polymer field, with the special focus on the PVDF polymer and its composites and also discuss its potential applications and continuing growth in the development of sustainable power sources from wearable technology. We also introduce a brief collection of fiber-based self-powered devices and discuss future directions, challenges, opportunities and guidelines for future development in the area of fiber-based piezoelectric generators.
2. E-textile technologies
Computers and smartphones have changed our daily life due to transferring an enormous amount of data which connect us to our surrounding environment. These electronic devices have been developed and now come in different shapes, having in common that they are wearable, collect data smartly and bring communication and computing much closer to the human body. These fundamental needs have led to a technological convergence growth, most significantly, mechanical suitability, integrated electronics, and communicative ability, which generate the concept of wearable electronics.117,118 Electronic textiles have been considered owing to a rise of internet-of-things (IoTs) and wearable electronics.119 Electronic textiles (e-textile) are able to perform electronic functions and are perceived as a way to add features into ordinary wearable textiles and build competitive advantages in the market.120,121 In the last two years, wearable electronics (apparatuses worn directly on the skin in different parts of the body), including shirts, necklaces, shoes, headbands, smart wristbands, watches and eyeglasses have gained considerable attention, because data collection both continuously and noninvasively in real-time can be easily achieved.122 E-textiles are likely to be built from a wide range of functional devices that may include displays, sensors, microprocessors, batteries, communication units, etc. In this case these devices may have quite a different appearance from conventional rigid electronic devices, thus being stretchable, flexible, patchable to the skin, and even body implantable. In terms of these aspects, e-textiles seem to be highly appropriate. Textiles benefited from properties including flexibility, light weight, compressibility, and wearability have been evolved into the research and development which covering materials science, electronic technologies and mechanical engineering and making e-textile technology40 (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Multidisciplinary environment for e-textiles. 
In the past few years, various electronic devices such as transistors, displays, sensors, and batteries have been integrated into textiles, which were bulky, rigid, and heavy increasing the load for users.123 Today these electronic devices have been developed which helps users to combine the features of both fashion items and information technology products.124 Hence, integrating materials science, functional textiles, and apparel design leads to the rapid growth of new types of fibers, fabrics, and garments.125 E-textiles attract attention as next-generation electronics due to their wide range of applications from wearable human-interactive interfaces and biomedical/wellness monitors to consumer electronics and shape-adaptive military equipment.126 There have been many efforts during the last few decades to design and develop a series of e-textiles that are smart and flexible enough to use in everyday life.127 These efforts offer a research platform in the areas of smart textiles and wearable technology. Smart textiles become a major segment of e-textiles along with smart clothing and information science which will be discussed in detail in the following section.
2.1 Smart textiles
Textiles have been at the center of human technological innovation for thousands of years.128 Previous textiles just consider the clothing necessity of human beings and now have developed into an innovative area that is able to satisfy human needs to the supreme extent. Textiles which focus on preliminary necessities are called “first generation textiles”.129 Nowadays the term “Smart textiles” refers to a broad range of research fields and products that develop the usefulness and functionality of common textiles. Smart textiles are defined as textile products such as fibers, filaments and yarns in the form of knitted, woven or non-woven structures, which can interact with the environment and users.130 In a more clear definition, smart textiles are described as textiles that can sense and react to environmental conditions or thermal, mechanical, chemical, magnetic, or electrical stimuli, or other sources.131 These functional properties are not normally associated with traditional textiles.132 Parallel with technology development the need for a flexible information framework to facilitate the model of widespread computing, and a platform for monitoring the human vital signs in an efficient and cost-effective manner with a “universal” interface of clothing essentially led to the birth of the smart textiles field.133 In fact, smart textiles are at a meeting point between electronics and textiles134 which has a very promising realm in science and technology nowadays because of public interest and marketability.135 Smart textiles have been used in several applications in the healthcare industry and military, and as wearable electronics.136 Sporting and fashion industries are expected to contribute more to smart textiles than other industries.137 Several steps are included in creating smart textiles: (a) fabric production, especially for mass production, (b) integration of power sources and electronic parts into textiles and (c) communication and operating systems.138 Smart textiles are able to sense and react to changes in their environment. They may be classified into three categories: passive, active and very smart textiles.136 Passive smart textiles are the first generation of smart textiles and only able to sense environmental stimuli and have been used in biomedical fields, such as sensing of biophony, electroencephalography, electrocardiogram and body movement.139 Also shape memory materials, hydrophilic or hydrophobic textiles, etc. are part of this group.140 Active smart textiles can sense and respond to stimuli from the environment. These materials are used as sensors and actuators.131 The third category includes very smart textiles that consist of a unit for sensing, reasoning and actuating. They are able to detect various signals from the environment (light intensity, temperature, pollution, etc.), choose how to respond, and finally to act by using various flexible textile based actuators (textile displays, micro vibrating devices, OLEDs, LEDs, etc.).135 Totally this type of textile senses, reacts and adapts themselves to environmental conditions.130 Corresponding to the development of wearable applications, the use of smart textiles increased for real-time monitoring of bioelectrical signals, where a conductive fiber or fabric can be used as a dry electrode. Currently, most of the commercial smart textiles are advanced based on this type of sensor.141 Smart textile items consist of: (a) a sensing part, (b) an actuating part, (c) a communication unit, (d) a powering/generating/storing component, (e) a data analysis element, and (f) interconnects.134 In this field, smart wearable structures provide some advantages such as conformability to the human body at rest and in motion, comfort in close contact to skin, and suitability as substrates for smart components.142 Today, smart textiles by having unique features such as flexibility, in-plane shear, double-curvature bending, structural transformation (very low fiber strain in a largely deformed fabric) and cost-effectiveness in mass production provide a perfect platform for wearable technology advancement.143
2.2 Wearable technology
“Wearable technology” and “wearable devices” are terms that describe computers and electronics that are integrated into clothing and other accessories that can be worn comfortably on the body. Over recent years, wearable devices have evolved from bulky, large, and uncomfortable technologies to more fashionable, lightweight, and portable items.144 The ideal intention of wearable technologies is to integrate functional portable electronics and computers seamlessly into people's daily lives. In wearable technology the conductive areas can be established typically by manually attaching conventional wires or sewing conductive yarns,38 printing rigid and stretchable conduction lines,145 replacing non-conductive fibers with conductive ones146 and other developed technologies. The advancement of conducting fibers with desired properties is an important step in the application of fibrous materials in wearable technology. The two most important properties of wearable devices are the breathability and flexibility that provide fabric-based comfort properties.147 Embedding microelectronic devices into wearable products like fibers, yarns or fabrics has the advantage of utilization of the existing industries, such as textiles, footwear, jewelry, apparel and electronics.143 Wearable technology with persuasive features of being breathable, flexible, lightweight, shape conformal and even washable provides a novel way for designing functional next-generation wearable electronics.148 A critical component in the area of wearable technology specifically for future portable and wearable electronics is fiber electronics which concern electronic devices on textile fibers. Their final applications include the fields of entertainment, finance, education, music and gaming. However, potentially, their impact is greatest in the fields of health care, medicine, and fitness wearable technology.149 Textiles are the main interface between the naked body and surrounding environment150 and hence they can collect signals from the human body as inputs and provide a sufficient response for the monitored person through a connected device.151 Wearable technologies can be used to manage personal healthcare by early detection of health disorders by monitoring physiological functions such as sleep,152,153 heart rate,154 blood pressure155 and breath for the detection of volatile organic compounds156 to obtain real-time information about the performance of the human body.157 Real-time generators are required to achieve long term cycling and efficient electrical output to support continuous operation in environmental monitoring, defence, and healthcare biomedical device applications.158 The reason for measuring real time data is due to users' desire to quantify their ability to collect more information which will bring advances in sensors to provide deeper measuring capability. Users learn more about themselves, and thus change in lifestyle can be under their control.124 Wearable textiles in sportswear could help to enhance athletic personal comfort, performance and protection. They also provide useful information on the athletes' physical abilities, training status, and responses to exercise.67 It has been proved that the highest production of biomechanical power is formed in the lower limb, at the ankle during the foot-strike.159 Power consumption, power sources, and energy efficiency are important factors which should be considered in the selection and design of wearable technologies. Wearable sensors have to be extremely power efficient, because frequent battery changes for multiple wearable sensors would likely to prevent users' acceptance and increase the final cost.160 All of the wearable e-textiles have battery demands that must be fulfilled either by detachable or by thin, flat, and flexible batteries that are able to endure washing, drying, ironing, and dry cleaning.120 To power wearable electronics, commercial rechargeable batteries have been widely used, which require periodic recharging due to their limitation in energy storage capacity. However, repeated battery charging interrupts continuous monitoring since the devices typically have to be taken off during recharging.26 Apart from the danger of explosion and possible leakage of electrolyte solution, batteries may cause severe potential accidents to both the human body and ambient environment. Therefore, harvesting energy from body movements and the ambient environment which can extend the life of batteries or replace them is extremely desirable to work with wearable devices always and everywhere.48 Since body movement is an infinite and charge-less energy source, and clothes are an essential requirement in daily life, textile based generators will become an extremely attractive topic for harvesting body movement energy which is less affected by the ambient environment.37 The human body joint points are in a continuous state of motion in a fixed axis which provides an input mechanical source to harvest this motion energy.161 The criteria for wearable electronic devices are that they must be invisible and comfortable and provide reasonably long reactivity lifetime with appropriate power output and low-cost fabrication processes.28 Depending on the body motion or signal that requires to be harvested or sensed, the selection of material is very important in corporation of wearable and flexible electronics. Future predictions for material selection show that materials available in nature for wearable electrodes will get a higher market share, followed by composites made from natural/synthetic sources.137 Hence piezoelectric materials prove to be one of the right choices for energy harvesting from body movements.45 Since the most specific feature of the mechanical movement of the human body is its low frequency nature and the large displacements associated with it,162 the harvester should be highly efficient, soft and comfortable. Many flexible energy harvesters have been reported using various conversion mechanisms, including piezoelectric,74 electrostatic,163 and triboelectric164 mechanisms. The piezoelectric mechanism is superior to the other conversion mechanisms due to its high energy density and adaptability across a wide range of dimensions.165 Piezoelectric textiles have been recommended for use in wearable devices due to their stable energy conversion properties, stable mechanical properties and high sensitivities.166 Power generation could be attained through piezoelectric elements that generate energy from various sources of motion or vibration.130 Wearable piezoelectric generators can be used for generating power from different human activities including finger, knee or elbow bending and foot stepping to power up portable and wearable electronic devices.6Fig. 2 demonstrates diverse applications of textile-based piezo generators on the human body.

3. Piezoelectric generators
A variety of ambient energy sources such as thermal, solar, acoustic energy, acoustic noise, nuclear power, human activities, and vibration have been studied as additional energy providers in recent years. Among them, thermoelectric generators, vibration/kinetic driven power generators, and solar cells are more widely studied because of their ubiquity, high efficiency, and potential for miniaturization.167,168 Based on materials, structural formation, and working mechanisms, generators can be classified into three main groups: pyroelectric, triboelectric and piezoelectric.37 Pyroelectric generators can periodically convert thermal energy variation into electricity. However, thermal energy is hard to control and cannot be used for medical implants, and the conversion efficiency is lower compared with vibration and solar energy sources.56 Triboelectric169 and piezoelectric170 generators enable efficient conversion of mechanical energy into electricity.171 Recently, triboelectric generators have been used to harvest mechanical energy from friction, vibration and even acoustic waves.3 With a similar device size, piezoelectric generators can generate more electric charge than their triboelectric counterparts, so they are more suitable to make wearable devices.172 The literature review shows that the environmental mechanical energy density can reach 1–10 mW cm−2, which has the second place after solar energy (10–100 mW cm−2).173 Piezoelectric generators transform mechanical energy into electricity through deformation of the piezoelectric material sandwiched between two electrodes, which induces a piezoelectric potential.174 This feature enables piezoelectric electronics to be easily miniaturized and made/integrated into complex shapes/structures,175 whereas the human body is a mechanical energy source and also compatible with wearable electronics, providing a self-dependent way for energy utilization which is in high demand.37 Piezoelectric generators attract the attention of researchers and engineers in the area of wearable electronics, with nearly 5000 publications in the last decade.175 Numerous approaches have been used to fabricate piezoelectric generators, such as spinning, coating, printing, and deposition (Fig. 3). Film forming techniques such as coating, blading, casting and painting are simple and useful techniques but their ability may be limited by the dimension, structure, or surface.176 Printing technology provides a favourable solution for mass production and fabrication of less complex shapes. This technique is a high efficiency method to reduce material consumption and final cost.177 Spinning processes such as wet spinning,34 melt spinning,46 dry spinning,29 gel spinning,178 and electrospinning179 are the common methods for fabricating flexible piezoelectric generators with the ability for mass production.

3.1 Principle of piezoelectricity
The term “piezoelectricity” is derived from the Greek word “piezein” which means pressing (squeezing).180 The Curie brothers first discovered the piezoelectric effect in 1880.180 It is expected that more than 30% of the materials available in the world have a piezoelectric effect. Despite the fact that a wide variety of materials show this property, just a few of them have found practical applications.181 The term ‘piezoelectricity’ is used for dielectric materials that generate electrical charges across their boundaries due to the mechanical stress application, which is known as the direct piezoelectric effect (Fig. 4). The direct piezoelectric effect can be implemented for energy harvesting. Charge was generated at each surface of materials due to the polarised aligned dipoles and domains. Ions and electrons as free charges flow through the surface charge of the material.182 In the converse (or indirect) piezoelectric effect, a mechanical strain occurs when the material is subjected to an electrical field.183 The converse piezoelectric effect is more applicable to acoustic emitters, vibration damping and actuators. In piezoelectric materials, the relationship between the applied stress and induced charges per unit area is linear and reversible.183 There is an accurate definition of piezoelectricity based on crystallography and ion distribution within a single unit cell. The common case is when there is no applied pressure the centres of the negative and positive charges are non-centrosymmetric within the unit cell planes.184
 Fig. 4  Schematic of (a) direct and (b) converse piezoelectric effects. 
Among the 32 crystallographic point groups, 11 groups are centrosymmetric and include an inverse centre. In this case, polar properties in a material are impossible since an existing symmetry transformation inverted each polar vector. All other remaining 21 non-centrosymmetric point groups (without an inversion centre) exhibit piezoelectric properties.185 In fact, the piezoelectric effect comes from inadequate symmetry in the ion distributions of crystalline materials.182 Many research studies have been conducted on harvesting energy from piezoelectric materials along with the closely related sub-classes of pyroelectrics and ferroelectrics.44,186Fig. 5 shows the relationships between ferroelectric, pyroelectric, piezoelectric and dielectric materials, whereas when these properties are available in the same material, it provides the material with a fascinating prospect for harvesting energy from various sources such as vibration, light and thermal variations.187
 Fig. 5  Dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric and ferroelectric material relationships. 

3.1.1 Piezoelectric constitutive equations. 
The piezoelectric constitutive equations can be given as follows for the relationship between the strain x, electric displacement D, electric field E and stress X: x = sEX + dE(1) D = dX + ε0εXE(2)where sE and εX are the elastic compliance (under constant E) and relative permittivity (under constant X), d is the piezoelectric constant, and ε0 is the vacuum permittivity. Note that the converse piezoelectric effect (eqn (1)) and the direct piezoelectric effect (eqn (2)) have the same piezoelectric constant.188 The piezoelectric constitutive equations assume that the transducer strain is the sum of mechanical strain induced by the mechanical stress and the controllable actuation strain caused by the applied electric voltage.189


3.1.2 Piezoelectric figures of merit. 
A variety of performance measurements have been used to compare piezoelectric materials for various applications. The piezoelectric strain constant and piezoelectric voltage constant are suitable criteria for actuating and sensing applications. The cost, voltage output, power density and operational bandwidth are variables to be compared for energy harvesting application.190 Among them, the energy conversion efficiency is the most important factor to design piezoelectric energy harvesters for actual applications.191 The output electrical energy generated from the piezoelectric material depends on (i) the magnitude of applied mechanical energy, (ii) the energy conversion efficiency (mechanical to electrical energy) and (iii) the stored electrical energy productivity into usable, or output, electrical energy.192 Various figures of merit have been generated for assessing the energy conversion efficiency of piezoelectric materials (Table 1). Piezoelectric materials have five significant figures of merit: (1) the piezoelectric voltage constant g, (2) the piezoelectric strain constant d, (3) the mechanical quality factor Qm, (4) the electromechanical coupling factor k, and (5) the acoustic impedance Z. These figures of merit are presented in Table 1.193 Obviously for energy harvesting applications the figures of merit revealed that high piezoelectric activity is needed for maximum piezoelectric coefficients (such as d33 and d31). Fig. 6 presents the direction indexes of piezoelectric constants in a rectangular crystallographic system. The principal properties along X, Y and Z axes are described using 1, 2 and 3 notations, respectively. The shear constants are represented by 4, 5 and 6 respectively. The 33-mode refers to the application of stress in the direction of polarisation, whereas other modes are utilized for energy harvesting.194 In fact a superscript index on the electromechanical constant defines the constant condition during conducted measurements.195

3.1.3 Measuring and enhancing the piezoelectric coefficient (d33). 
The d33 coefficient is defined as the charge produced for an applied stress, or the strain for an applied voltage, and these are theoretically equivalent. Measurement of the d33 coefficient can be realized in several ways varying in accuracy and simplicity.196 A number of alternative static and quasistatic techniques had been reported to measure d33. These methods can be divided into two categories. One is to monitor the induced charge by applying a controllable external mechanical stress to the piezoelectric structure through the direct piezoelectric effect; the other is to measure the displacement in response to an applied voltage via the converse piezoelectric effort.197 The d33 piezoelectric constant is approximately twice that of d31, so higher performance is expected from a device operating in d33 mode such as pressure sensors.198 The d33 value can be measured by the P–E loop obtained from the PFM test or directly measured by the d33 meter. The electrical energy produced by the piezoelectric generator is proportional to its piezoelectric constant.199 PVDF and P(VDF–TrFE)s exhibit the strongest piezoelectric responses (d33 ≈ −30 pC N−1) among the polymer materials.200 There is a higher d33 value of the nanofibrous PVDF film due to the improvement in the β-phase content of the PVDF polymeric material. Also the annealing treatment on the nanofibrous film PVDF has exhibited a high d33 piezoelectric coefficient.201 The d33 profile along the diameter direction has higher values at the edge of the PVDF nanofibers.202 Controlling the relative humidity and voltage polarity increased the d33 piezoelectric coefficient for PVDF fibers by more than three times and allowed us to generate a power density of 0.6 μW cm−2 from PVDF membranes.203 The piezoelectric coefficient (d33) is found to increase from 10 to 35 pC N−1 with an increase in the volume fraction for 70 vol% of the micron-sized KNN crystallites in the PVDF matrix.204

3.2 Piezoelectric materials
Piezoelectric materials have received great interest in energy harvesting technology due to their unique ability to take advantage of ambient vibration energy conversion to electric potential.205 The specific energy transduction of piezoelectric materials enables their applications in the area of energy harvesting, sensors, actuators, structural health monitoring, and use in health care devices.206 Piezoelectric materials can be categorized into three groups: piezoelectric polymers, piezoelectric ceramics, and piezoelectric composites.207 Depending on the desired vibration amplitude and frequency, piezoelectric materials can be in the form of polycrystalline ceramics, textured ceramics, polymers or thin films.208 There are diverse piezoelectric ceramic forms, including nanowires, bulk, and nanofibers. The bulk form of piezoelectric ceramics has excellent characteristics but no flexibility, which limits their use in wearable devices. On the other side, nanowires have good flexibility without mass production capability.209 In the 1950s, the discovery of barium titanate (BT) and lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and the family of these piezoelectric materials is viewed as a major development in the field of sensors.210 PZT is the common ceramic based piezoelectric material, since it contains 60% lead which is harmful to the surrounding environment and human beings. The toxicity of these ceramic materials is only further enhanced due to volatilization at high temperatures during calcination and sintering. The high densities of these materials lead to large characteristic acoustic impedances, necessitating the usage of matching layers. The large relative permittivities of these materials facilitate electrical tuning, and reduce their piezoelectric voltage coefficients. The large mechanical quality factor requires the addition of damping layers to optimise resonance to an acceptable level.210 The solution to this problem is using lead free ceramic based piezoelectric materials like barium titanate (BT), potassium sodium niobate (KNaNbO3) and potassium niobate (KNbO3).211 Nevertheless, piezoelectric ceramics have intrinsic limitations like lower piezoelectric voltage constant and brittleness as compared to piezoelectric polymers.212 To overcome these issues, piezoelectric polymers are a good alternative to piezo ceramics. Piezoelectric polymers have the advantages of flexibility, easy fabrication process and comparatively low price. Therefore, fabrication of flexible sensors, fabric sensors and fiber based generators is facilitated by piezoelectric polymers.213 In the field of piezoelectric ceramics, PZT and associated materials, which exhibit a piezoelectric response and high dielectric constant, are most widely used. However, the application of these piezoelectric ceramics was restricted owing to the presence of lead, hardness, high thermal conductivity, fragility and relatively high cost. Barium titanate as an inorganic filler due to its ease of handling and environmentally friendly nature is more preferable than lead-free materials. However, the poor flexibility of BT limits its applications for large scale fabrication. To overcome this problem, polymer/ceramic composites have been developed as substitute materials that have the properties of both materials to provide new materials with tailored performance as either actuators or sensors. Choosing suitable ceramic fillers is important to improve the mechanical or dielectric properties of polymer composites.214 Hence, polymer/ceramic composites have been investigated as candidate dielectric materials. Recently, PVDF/BTO nanocomposites are highly attractive for energy harvesting and sensor applications due to their simple and accessible fabrication methods, low cost, and ideal piezoelectric properties.194

3.2.1 Piezoelectric polymers. 
Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as a most favourable piezoelectric polymer is highlighted in materials science research due to the discovery of the piezoelectric effect in PVDF films by Kawai in 1969.213 PVDF is a thermoplastic semi-crystalline polymer that has been extensively considered for its piezoelectric properties, moderately good chemical resistance, strength and thermal resistance.215,216 PVDF and its copolymers, such as poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-chlorotrifluoro ethylene), poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene), and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene-co-chlorotrifluoro ethylene),217 are known to have very stable and large piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and pyroelectric properties among polymers. Also, PVDF has high chemical resistivity which protects it from cleaning agents, skin products, and sweat.218 The PVDF homopolymer contains 59.4 wt% fluorine and 3 wt% hydrogen. The existence of fluorine atoms with a large van der Waals radius and electronegativity in the polymer chain [–CH2–CF2–] leads to a dipole moment perpendicular to the monomer chain.182 The piezoelectric properties of PVDF derive from the larger difference in electronegativity between carbon and fluorine atoms than between carbon and hydrogen atoms. In the polymer structure, depend on the crystal geometry, the dipole moments would be added to each other to provide a net electric dipole moment.219 PVDF includes at least four different crystalline phases, having the non-polar α phase and polar β, δ and γ phases. The PVDF β phase has the highest polarizability of polar phases, but it is not appropriate for high energy storage due to ferroelectric switching and dissipation of a large amount of energy during the charge–discharge process.220 Different chain conformations lead to the formation of different phases: trans-planar zigzag (TTT) for the β-phase, T3GT3G′ for γ and ε phases and TGTG′ (trans–gauche–trans–gauche) for the α and δ phases.221 In particular, the β phase has intrinsic spontaneous polarization in comparison with the ε and γ phases, which provides PVDF with piezoelectricity and ferroelectricity.222 Although the PVDF polymer is recommended for piezoelectric applications, it has some inherent limitations including a lower dielectric constant and piezoelectric charge constant (d33). The piezoelectric properties of the PVDF polymer rely on the aggregate of β phase formation.223
Enhancing method to increase the β-phase formation of PVDF. 
Over the last few years, many researchers have focused on controlling the morphology and performance enhancement of PVDF relating to its piezoelectricity. Therefore, many pieces of interesting information concerning about the relationship between PVDF morphology and fabrication conditions have been presented.224 The PVDF piezoelectric properties depend upon the aggregate of β phase formation. Therefore, the β phase formation of PVDF is one of the most and vital parameters for piezoelectric properties, which generally happens by subsequent stretching and a high voltage poling process (Fig. 7).225 The poling process reoriented the dipole moments and led to enhancement of the power generation capability. Prior to poling, for the same length of chain, the dipole moment of the stretched chain was much lower than the dipole moment of a β-PVDF chain. When an electric field was applied to the stretched chain (over 50 MV cm−1) perpendicularly, a rotation of –CF2 and –CH2 around the chain axis in the reverse directions is expected. When the electric field is over 100 MV cm−1, the direction shifts from the α-phase to the β-phase can be predicted.226 The techniques that include stretching, such as electrospinning, can cause a higher β phase than an α phase. Due to the strong elongation flow in the jet, PVDF dipole chains align to the applied stress direction and consequently phase transformations happen by polymer chain orientation.227 During the manufacturing process of melt spun fibers, the PVDF is stretched and the polymer is mainly present in the β phase.108 Also in the electrospinning process the β-phase content increased by optimizing the electrospinning process and decreasing the fiber diameter.228–231 Temperature has a significant role in the PVDF crystallization procedure. Drawing at low temperature does not provide appropriate β phase formation and piezoelectric properties due to the random orientation.232 The highest β phase content was achieved for the annealed PVDF film at 90 °C.233 Thermal processing had a direct effect on modifying the crystalline microstructure and also confirmed that heat stretching and annealing could increase the degree of crystallinity and β-phase crystallization for PVDF wet spun fibers.234 The β-phase crystallization at a high cooling rate is still controversial, but this important finding means that the crystallization mechanisms of PVDF into the β-phase could be controlled from the melt state with the cooling rate.235 It is observed that the melt-quenching process assists the β-phase crystallization in the PVDF film (51%) and thereby enhances the domain switching behaviour, ferroelectric and dielectric properties.236 The β-phase crystalline content in the bicomponent fibers of PVDF/PU remained unchanged after the hydrothermal treatment.237 Current research has considered nanofiller addition such as metal nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, nanoclay, graphene, zinc oxide, and barium titanate into PVDF for the β-phase formation enhancement.238 Filler addition disrupts the polymer molecular chain, which leads to a higher piezoelectric response by enhancement of the β-phase crystallinity. The piezoelectric response of the polymer nanocomposite increases while ceramic based materials with high piezoelectric coefficients, like barium titanate, have been incorporated into the PVDF matrix.239 The degree of crystallinity of the PVDF/PEO films exhibits a non-linear increase, with increasing amount of PEO in the films.240 The –OH groups on cellulose are a requirement for β-phase evolution in PVDF.241 The incorporation of functional fillers such as carbon-based materials into the PVDF matrix can induce the PVDF electroactive crystalline phase by interfacial interaction, and also enhance the dielectric constant of the composites based on the percolation theory.242 PVDF composites with graphene oxide (GO) or reduced graphene oxide (RGO) using spin coating and annealing were found to crystallize the PVDF in the ferroelectric phase. The existence of hydrogen bonding and/or electrostatic interaction between the oxygen functionalities of RGO (or GO) and PVDF causes the nucleation of the ferroelectric β or γ phase.243 The dielectric constant increased by four times and the piezoelectric coefficient also increased twice by the addition of RGO into the PVDF films. The phase transition from α to β will contribute to an increase in the overall dielectric constant upon addition of RGO.244 Addition of GO/rGO can promote the β-phase formation in the PVDF matrix by successful interaction between the –CO group of GO/rGO and the –CF2 or −CH2 group of PVDF. GO and rGO possess large specific surface areas and carrier mobility coupled with abundant defects and several functional groups (–OH, –C–O–C, and –CO groups). The presence of these defects and abundant surface functional groups in/on GO and rGO plays a significant role in improving the dipole polarisation and dielectric properties of constituent composites.245 In fact, the π-electrons which are mobile in RGO attract the CH2 dipoles of PVDF and help in aligning the β-phase of PVDF. Also addition of RGO helps in providing a conducting path for the charges induced inside the film to move to the surface and further allows the dipoles of PVDF to align which leads to an enhanced piezo response.246 In PVDF/CNT composites the enhancement and stabilization of the pure β phase are possible with the appropriate modification of CNTs.247 The β-phase content increased by designing the core–shell structure using inorganic BaTiO3 nanoparticles as the core and PVDF doped with graphene oxide nanosheets as the shell.248 Also the β-phase content was improved by doping Ag nanowires into the PVDF fibers through electrostatic interaction between surface charges of the nanowires and dipoles of the PVDF chains.249 The pressure-quenching process could provide ideal crystallization conditions to obtain β extended chain crystals without causing undesired autonomous PVDF thermal degradation.250 Incorporation of various nanofillers into the PVDF matrix results in variation in piezoelectric responses due to different percentages of the β-phase. However, the β-phase formation is not the only effective parameter in the piezoelectric response. The interconnectivity and the arrangement of the neighboring dipoles are also effective for the piezoelectric response.239

3.2.2 Piezoelectric ceramics. 
Piezo ceramics have the best piezoelectric performance; nevertheless, their inherent brittleness restricts their application in flexible devices. Among different ceramics, barium titanate (BaTiO3), lead zirconium titanate (PZT), bismuth strontium titanate (BiSrTiO3), strontium titanate (SrTiO3), calcium titanate (CaTiO3), and PZT possess the highest dielectric and ferroelectric properties. Recently most concern is about the lead toxicity in PZT containing devices which is harmful for human health and the environment.251 To solve this problem lead free BTO is considered due to its environmental friendliness and high piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties along with a high dielectric constant.252 Barium titanate which is a perovskite has the general formula ABO3, and has a primitive cubic structure, with larger cation-A in the corner, smaller cation-B in the middle and the anion, commonly oxygen, in the centre of the face edges.253 BTO is a perovskite crystal at temperatures lower than the Curie temperature when it is placed in a strong DC electric field the crystal undergoes a ferroelectric transition from the cubic to the tetragonal phase (Fig. 8) and becomes spontaneously polarized due to the unidirectional intermittent displacement of Ti4+ ions to neighbouring O2− ions.254 Barium titanate can be prepared by various methods based on the desired properties.255 Bulk BTO is fragile and therefore cannot be instantly used as a mechanical energy harvesting material.256,257 In order to improve the piezoelectric properties of lead-free nanomaterials, many research groups have performed studies on single crystal growth, defect control and agglomeration prevention, which have offered reliable dielectric, piezoelectric and elastic properties, respectively.258 Many research studies have confirmed that the grain size of ceramics plays an important role in the piezoelectric performance. The grain size of BTO ceramics has an important effect on d33.259 It was revealed that the BTO dielectric constant increased with the decrease of the average grain size firstly, reached the maximum in the particle size range of 0.8–1.1 μm, and then decreased rapidly as the grain size decreased further.260,261 Nowadays, the piezoelectric performance at a low mechanical impact was enhanced through composite materials which are formed by the integration of organic polymers and inorganic materials. Furthermore, the use of composite materials to fabricate piezoelectric generator devices provides several benefits including high flexibility, ease of processing, low internal leakage current, sustaining/harvesting large mechanical forces at low cost, mass production and higher electrical output in comparison with conventional piezoelectric generators.262 By incorporating one-dimensional BTO nanowires into nanocomposites the generator film can reach both performance enhancement and homogeneous distribution of piezoelectric materials and also prevent the aggregation of piezoelectric nanoparticles.263 The effect of BTO on the electrical properties of polymer composites has attracted more attention. It is shown that BTO could increase the resistance of composites up to 186 kΩ.264 The paraelectric BTO nanoparticles modified the Young's modulus, piezoelectric coefficient, and dielectric constant of the composite.265 The dispersion of BTO nanoparticles in the PVDF matrix was greatly improved owing to the change of BTO nanoparticles by air plasma and phase formation was enhanced up to 80%.266 Low temperature plasma alters the BTO nanoparticle surface in order to improve the interfacial compatibility between ferroelectric PVDF and BTO nanoparticles. This modification demonstrated a lower dielectric loss and higher dielectric constant.266Table 2 compares the physical and piezoelectric properties of PVDF and BaTiO3 as the piezoelectric polymer and ceramic.

3.3 Piezoelectric textiles

3.3.1 Charge generation mechanism. 
The applied pressure on clothes is classified into two groups: vertical pressure (clothing weight) and horizontal pressure (surface and contact pressure). Horizontal pressure caused by body pressure during wearing clothes is a crucial factor for evaluating the restriction of wearer mobility. Stretchable parts in garments such as knee, elbow and back areas are considered mostly for energy harvesting applications.272 The applied strain and piezoelectric constant are two important considerations in output power generation. In comparison with bulk ceramics, PVDF has a lower piezoelectric constant and can generate a higher output power if the external force applied induces more stress on it. The finite element modelling and theory of curved piezoelectric generators have been used to analyze the applied stress and performance of piezoelectric generators.273–275 The simulation results indicate that the output voltage increases linearly as a result of bending velocity increase. The generator output current has the same trend as the output voltage. By increasing the external load, the output current decreases but the output voltage follows an opposite trend.17
The ferroelectric domains tend to align along the direction of the applied electrical field when subjected to a strong electrical field, as shown in Fig. 9(i). When there is no external force on the device, the device has no output electric signal due to electrical equilibrium within the device.276 When force is applied on the piezo fabric surface, its volume decreases and negative strain is produced. A piezo potential was formed between the electrodes as a result of charge centre separation and formation of electrical dipoles. During the pressing process, the piezo potential forces electrons to move toward the external circuit and consequently reach a new equilibrium state (Fig. 9(ii)). As a result, electricity was generated from mechanical energy. The maximum pressure on the surface leads to full contact between the electrodes and active area which provides the highest polarization density (Fig. 9(iii)). By releasing the external force, electrons return to the equivalence charge state under short-circuit conditions (Fig. 9(iv)).37 The piezoelectric coefficient (d3i) which the ratio of the open circuit charge density to the applied stress is used to measure the material piezoelectric performance. Typically, the d33 coefficient is higher than the d31 coefficient.277 When the piezoelectric energy harvesting device is subjected to compressive stress by an external force, the PVDF and substrate are subjected to tensile stress to generate an electric potential (Fig. 10a).17 As an example curve theory of piezoelectric materials Fig. 10b shows a woven textile structure with warp and weft yarns that cross over. The weft yarns that cross the warp yarns in an orthogonal direction are produced from the PVDF film and metal electrodes.20 According to Fig. 10a the following equation is used to calculate the output voltage (v) in mode d31, where t is the thickness of the piezoelectric material, g31 is the voltage coefficient and σ is stress. V31 = σxxg31t(3)
 Fig. 9  Schematic illustration of the piezoelectric charge generation process for textile based generators: (i) the dipole gets aligned in the direction of the applied electric field after the poling process, (ii) the piezoelectric potential is generated by applying compressive force, (iii) maximized press state with the highest polarization density, and (iv) electrons flow back along the opposite direction as the compressive force is released. 
 Fig. 10  (a) Curved piezoelectric generator with the d31 mode.17 (b) The cross-sectional view of the woven structure of the PVDF film and the operating principle.20 
Also the electrical charge can be estimated from the curved piezoelectric generator using electrical displacement and mechanical strain. The surface charge of the piezoelectric material, q, can be calculated from the integral of electrical displacement over the effective surface area of electrodes (Fig. 10b):278 (4)
The surface charge is defined as a function of the strain induced in the system. Thus, the electric charge intensely depends on the strain induced in the device.17 Based on eqn (1) the electric charge per unit area is affected by the strain, and if the strain is increased through the garment design, an increase in the value of Q can be expected. For a harmonic excitation, the current (I) is: (5)
The garment design plays a significant role in increasing the efficiency of piezoelectric energy harvesters. Garment optimal design adjusts the desired mechanical deformation to support the performance of piezoelectric generators. In fact, by increasing garment elastic activity the piezoelectric energy harvester exhibits better performance.279


3.3.2 Performance enhancement of piezoelectric textiles. 
With the prompt progress in wireless and wearable electronic devices, the need for high performance energy harvesters to utilize ambient environmental sources as well as human movement to power electronic devices is becoming increasingly important.280 One of the challenges toward wearable piezoelectric generators is finding appropriate and cost effective approaches with good compatibility with available textile technologies. However, because of the intrinsic properties of textiles such as surface morphologies, material properties and wavy structures, it is problematic to achieve appropriate combination between electrodes and textile substrates.37 In order to obtain more performance from piezoelectric textile generators, different approaches which consist of fabrication techniques and material selection are analysed to reach the best output (Fig. 11).
 Fig. 11  Schematic of diverse enhancing methods for fiber based piezoelectric generator performance. 
Among fabrication techniques for piezoelectric generators there are two common types of fabrication methods for piezoelectric fibers: (1) melt-spinning and (2) the electrospinning process. The melt spinning method has the advantages of low-porosity fibers and control over the fiber diameter. However, melt-spun fibers need a post treatment process due to randomly oriented molecular dipoles.46 Instead, electrospun fibers due to the high electric field during manufacturing do not need a further poling process however this process is quite tedious and expensive and does have limited capability for mass production.111,281 The outputs from polymer-based piezoelectric generators are not enough to fulfill the requirements for practical applications since polymers have a low piezoelectric coefficient in comparison with inorganic piezoelectric materials.91 Piezoelectric energy harvesters have been produced using both polymeric and inorganic materials as well as their combination. There are some disadvantages associated with the application of inorganic materials that hinder their real potential. This includes the high cost, lack of scalability and integrability and failing at very low strains.282 Over the years, among the most promising power generators, piezoelectric materials have attracted considerable attention as candidates for mechanical energy conversion. The forms of nanostructured piezoelectric materials that have been used in piezoelectric generator fabrication include ceramics (PZT, PMN-PT, NaNbO3, ZnSnO3, etc.), semiconductors (ZnO, GaN, ZnS, CdS, etc.) and polymers (PVDF and copolymers). Among these, piezoelectric materials with high piezoelectric constants and perovskite structures such as BaTiO3, PZT etc., have been found to be perfect candidates for energy harvesting application. These conventional inorganic piezoelectric materials, however, require complicated synthesis processes such as high-temperature calcination and sintering.283 In this situation, piezoelectric generators are made by embedding ceramic nanofillers with high piezoelectric coefficients in various flexible polymeric media of good processability.284 It is desirable to have lower interfacial tensions and higher filler dispersibility in a nanocomposite structure so it is essential to utilize the piezoelectric performances of modified nanoparticles. Inorganic fillers in the composite structure present lots of probable methods to enhance the performance of nanocomposites, including modulating the content, size and morphology of nanofillers. But the effect of nanofillers on piezoelectric performance and the best fabrication design of nanocomposite fibers for piezoelectric generators are still outstanding issues.285 Selection of conductive materials with the best electrical output, ideal mechanical characteristics and long-term environmental quality is an important consideration for textile based generators.37 The PVDF and conductive filler (carbon black,286 carbon nanotubes (CNTs),287 and graphene nanoplate288) combination can obtain an enhancement in dielectric properties with reduced filler consumption.

4. Wearable piezoelectric generators
4.1 Wearable piezoelectric generators based on piezoelectric polymers
Piezoelectric polymers, because of their flexibility, are more appropriate for wearable piezoelectric generators. Among all of the piezoelectric polymers, PVDF and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (PVDF–TrFE) are mostly utilized in piezoelectric devices due to their high flexibility, high strain level, ease of thermal processing and best piezoelectric properties.183 Since the fiber is the smallest and basic part of garments many research studies in the field of wearable technology focus on making piezoelectric fibers. Fiber based structures and textiles because of their softness, flexibility and three-dimensional deformation are extremely desirable for wearable electronic devices.48 Fiber based piezoelectric generators with the ease of integration into garments can directly convert mechanical energy into electrical signals. The surface charges can be transferred and collected by the harvesting interface circuit. In the single fiber structure in order to collect the charge from the piezoelectric part, electrodes should be in coaxial or core–shell structures. In this approach conductive materials as electrodes need to be coated289 or wrapped21 around the active piezoelectric part. Piezoelectric polymer solution can be coated on conductive substrate such as metal deposited polymer fibers and metal wires but the poor adhesion between polymer and electrodes need more investigation.290 By a simple rolling and coating method a four stage processed piezoelectric fiber was made, and electrospun mats prepared from PVDF–TrFE were manually wrapped around a silver coated nylon multifilament yarn that acted as the inner electrode. The wrapped carbon nanotube sheets were on the outer side. The fabrication of fiber generators was finalised by dip coating in an elastomeric layer which was mechanically protective and electrically insulating.291 Although this structure demonstrates good mechanical and piezoelectric performance it still has slidable connection between the electrodes and the electrospun mat which leads to contact instability and increased wearing, thereby negatively affecting the output stability and durability of the devices.292 Also multiple processing steps for the production are time consuming and expensive. Another improved method towards achieving a high performance fiber in a one-step continuous method is synthesizing a core shell structure which has a conductive material as an electrode in the core and shell fabricated at the same time of piezo part fabrication. The piezoelectric generator presented a three-layered structure which consists of the PVDF electrospun web sandwiched between two membranes layers of PVDF/rGO through a continuous process.293 In this technique there is a robust adhesion between the electrodes and the PVDF nanofiber which provides more polarization possibilities. The electrospinning method is not appropriate for mass production and also electrospun fibers cannot be used in conventional textile industry machines to fabricate wearable textiles. To solve this problem the melt spinning technique with the advantages of mass production, high forming quality and on time forming has been widely used.28 The bicomponent fibres were produced with PVDF as the core sheath and carbon black/polyethylene as the core which are fed through two separate extruders during the spinning process. Silver paste on the yarn surface is used as the outer electrode.41 Since the assembly process has a key role in performance enhancement of piezoelectric devices, recently a triaxial melt-spun PVDF fiber has been developed with flexible yarns as electrodes. First, the as-spun PVDF filaments were braided around silver coated nylon yarns as inner electrodes and then the whole structure was covered with braided silver coated nylon fibers as outer electrodes. The developed fiber improved mechanical (i.e. flexibility, comfort and durability) and piezoelectric (i.e. power output and sensitivity) properties.46 All-fiber piezoelectric energy harvesting devices were encapsulated with a protective layer to increase their durability and wearable facility. Moreover, this technique has attracted significant attention of researchers due to the great feasibility of light weight design and also enables the use of all-fiber based generators in wearable technology.294Fig. 12 presents an all-fiber based piezoelectric generator without using metal wires or foil as electrodes. Fiber-based energy generators have been developed in the form of fabrics particularly. The piezoelectric performance of single fiber generators owing to the number and active area limitation is relatively low. One approach to overcome this problem is the integration of piezoelectric fibers into fabrics by using diverse textile fabrication techniques including knitting, braiding, and weaving (Fig. 13). Since wearable energy harvesting devices need to provide right feel and comfort to the wearer, the best design of the device is integration into textiles as part or even whole of the cloth. Therefore, textile-fiber structures would provide perfect building elements for a smart garment, as they could be naturally integrated into fabrics during the fabrication process without affecting flexibility, comfort and air permeability.4 Soft and flexible fiber-based generators can be designed with high fatigue resistance under numerous deformation cycles.15 Fabric generators should be capable of stretching and bending to guarantee fitting, improve comfortability, and increase the accessibility to human motions for the recovery of energy. The high strain elasticity of stretchable fabrics is associated with knitted fabric stretching and bending of elastic fibers, such as elastane, which offers a restoring force. Flexibility and stretchability are needed for a strong piezoelectric fiber for incorporation into smart textiles.21 The power output from woven fabrics made from polyamide yarns and melt-spun PVDF filaments showed that the harvested energy from textiles with a size of 15 × 100 mm is sufficient to power low-power electronics.24

The output voltage of a 3D interlock woven fabric from a 100% melt-spin piezoelectric filament was 16 times higher than the output voltage provided by a 2D plain woven.13 3D spacer piezoelectric fabrics have the advantages of efficient charge collection due to proper electrode connection and also uniform distribution of pressure on the fabric surface, causing performance enhancement. Also, this all-fibre piezoelectric fabric can be cut into any size and shape without affecting its flexibility and provide a simple route for integration.28 Generally, 3D fabric structures compared with 2D textile structures have higher efficiencies because of piezoelectric fiber density.37 Many research studies described flexible wearable generators, however many of them especially in the case of electrospinning were not flexible and did not bring the right feel of comfort for wearers. In fact, they have metal/metallic electrodes which limit their use, flexibility and lifetime.28 The poor resistance to fatigue causes early failure of metal foil electrodes. The separation in the metal–insulator–metal structure is due to the huge mismatch between the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the metal electrode and the piezoelectric layer. Therefore, the loss of mechanical integrity and electric connectivity occurred during long time device operations.15 In addition to piezoelectric materials for wearable technology, energy can be generated with triboelectric materials. Triboelectric materials through friction convert mechanical energy to electricity, by a coupled effect of triboelectrification and electrostatic induction.40 With appropriate structure designs and using both piezoelectric and triboelectric effects the contact friction and the deformation of materials can generate voltage and the applied mechanical energy is exploited with high efficiency (Fig. 14). The current methods to design and fabricate triboelectric structures are based on reactive ion etching or photolithography which both of them are expensive and complicated.295 Electrospinning is a simple, versatile and low-cost method to fabricate ultrathin fibers from a wide range of materials as well as ceramics, polymers and composites, and most triboelectric generators are made by this technique.3

4.2 Wearable piezoelectric generators based on piezoelectric composites
The piezoelectric performance of fiber-based generators is improved by incorporating piezoceramic nanoparticles into the piezoelectric polymer matrix. PVDF and its copolymers due to their transparency, flexibility, chemical stability, biocompatibility and high breakdown strength are considered to be the most promising candidates for wearable technology application. In addition, PVDF has a high piezoelectric voltage constant (g33) and a low dielectric constant (εr < 10).296 According to eqn (5) the energy density (Ue) of dielectric materials can be presented as follows where D is the electric displacement and E is the electric field: (6)
Therefore, both large electric displacement and high breakdown strength are desired for a high energy density. Common dielectric materials are usually modified with high dielectric constant ceramics, but in some cases undesirable temperature dependent breakdown strengths and loss characteristics could happen.297 To avoid these limitations, significant efforts have been made in making polymer–ceramic composites to achieve both a high breakdown strength and superior dielectric properties.298 The amount of ceramic filler added into the polymer matrix is very critical and generally the composite reaches the peak dielectric properties at >50 vol% ceramic filler.298 The addition of high-permittivity nanofillers is the most common way to enhance the dielectric properties of polymer composites. However, nanoparticle incorporation into the polymer matrix can improve the polymer composite permittivity, but it can also cause the decrease of dielectric breakdown strength. In some composite structures, cavitation occurs around the filler due to the absence of adhesion between the fillers and matrix. Surface modification of ceramic nanofillers is used to modify the interfacial areas between the ceramic and polymer matrix and consequently avoid filler aggregation and increase its dispersion in the polymer matrix.299 The usage of an appropriate surface modifier plays a key role in improving the piezoelectric response.300 It is desirable to fabricate generators from perovskite materials with large piezoelectric coefficients including BTO (100 pC N−1) and Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT, 200 pC N−1) for energy harvesting.301 Fabric-based piezoelectric generators are fabricated from traditional textile manufacturing, fabric platform methods and multilayer stacking techniques for electrospun webs (Fig. 15). In a stack form a PVDF–NaNbO3 electrospun web and elastic conductive fabric as electrodes convert a compression energy of 0.2 MPa into an output voltage of 3.4 V, and a short-circuit current of 4.4 μA at low frequency.15 The nonwoven PVDF/CNT/BTO fabric was fabricated by the electrospinning technique without further polarization. This layer was embedded between two layers of conductive fabrics as electrodes to generate a rectified average peak output voltage of ∼162 V.42 The corresponding voltage and current for PVDF/BTO (20 wt%) and PZT/PVDF (20 wt% PZT) fiber generators were ∼6 V and ∼4 nA and ∼3 V and ∼1.2 nA, respectively.302 In a tri-layer structure achieved by stacking two layers of PVDF/BTO nanocomposite films, one on each side of the surface-modified n-type graphene, a peak output voltage of 10 V along with 2.5 μA current at an applied force of 2 N is generated.296 In addition to better flexibility and good interfacial adhesion, the mechanical properties and cyclic durability of double-layered BT/PVDF films can also be improved. The double-layer BTO/PVDF (20 wt%) film exhibits significant performances of 6.7 V and 2.4 μA in output voltage and output current respectively.285 The electrospun web of 15 wt% BT nanoparticles added into the P(VDF–TrFE) solution can generate an output voltage of 25 V during walking at a frequency of 0.6 Hz under 600 N weight.303 Research confirmed that the existence of 20% BT filler of 10 nm size in the P(VDF–TrFE) matrix harvests ∼0.28 μW energy.304 The PVDF/BT melt spun fibers are knitted to form a wearable energy generator that produced a maximum voltage output of 4 V and a power density 87 μW cm−3 which is 45 times higher than those earlier reported for piezoelectric textiles.305 A BTO/PVDF/silver nanowire composite film with avoiding the electrical poling process presented a high voltage of ∼14 V and current of ∼0.96 μA.262 By dispersing BTO nanoparticles in the PVDF matrix, this particular film composite orientation can generate the highest output voltage up to 150 V.306 The piezoelectric coefficient increased by 47% after addition of 5 wt% BT into the nanofiber of P(VDF–TrFE). This improvement was also observed for both the current outputs and piezoelectric charge under compression force.307 On the fabric surface, piezoelectric materials can be grown and covered directly. ZnO nanowires were grown on the Au/Kapton substrate and PVDF was coated on the structure. Finally, through a thermal-evaporation method, the electrode was coated on the top surface of PVDF to achieve a hybrid flexible generator. The hybrid-fiber device, under elbow bending–releasing for ∼90°, generated an output voltage, current and power density of 0.1 V, 10 nA cm−2 and 16 μW cm−3, respectively.308 Hybrid generators with the combination of two power generation mechanisms have gained research interest recently. Piezoelectric and triboelectric nanostructures have been integrated onto fibers to convert the mechanical energy into electricity (Fig. 16). The selection of triboelectric materials and their surface area are more critical to obtain high power output. In order to enhance the triboelectric performance, ZnO nanoflowers as the piezoelectric material were used to improve the PDMS surface roughness. The device generated electrical output voltage/current values of ∼75 V/3.2 μA, ∼150 V/8 μA, during walking (Fig. 16a).14 The piezoelectric nanogenerator in the hybrid structure acts as a support for triboelectric nanogenerators for energy generation while it does not work in some situations. As a self-powered strain sensor, ZnO nanorods were grown around the conductive carbon fibers by a hydrothermal growth method to harvest energy from human movement (Fig. 16b).22 A comprehensive overview about the performance of PVDF based piezoelectric generators is presented in Table 3.

4.3 Smart wearable market
Wearable technology is a new trend that merges electronics with daily activities and makes an effort to change lifestyles. The market is divided based on product type, such as smart clothing, ear worn devices, smartwatches, fitness trackers, body worn devices, head-mounted display cameras and medical devices. The aim of wearable technologies is to improve physical performance and encourage regular physical activities and develop new habits through digital persuasion. Wearable electronic devices may offer social influencing or gamification of the exercise through challenge creation as well as virtual rewards to enhance physical performance.332 Since the wearable technology industry is a relatively new concept, the landscape is crowded with vendors across many market areas in the world. The market has already advanced beyond human fitness and wellness, health care and commercial and industrial applications. The market is expected to grow to an enormous value of 160 billion USD by 2026 from its current value of 40 billion USD.166 Amongst the 423 wearable device products on the current market, the largest market share is associated with fitness and lifestyle (Fig. 17a). The world market for wearable devices, now consisting of wireless headphones with smart assistants, has increased by 15.3% over the last year to 198.5 million parts in late 2019. The driving force for this growth is the continued spread of ear-worn devices, watches and wrist bands as well as further adoption in the healthcare division. The market is expected to achieve 279 million units by the end of 2023 with an 8.9% annual growth rate. It is predicted that during the period of 2018 to 2022 the wristband type growth will remain muted with a rate of 0.3%. However, it is important to mention that this category will still represent 24.7% of the total market by 2022 with the total amount reaching 47.0 million. In advanced markets, the low cost of wearable devices makes them possible to serve as simple patient health monitoring equipment.333 The overall wearable market had a 17% annual growth in shipping a total of 897000 units in the third quarter of the year 2018 from India. Suppliers will be looking to investigate some of the new categories for smart watches with cellular connectivity to provide solutions for healthcare and lifestyle management.334 Over the year 2019, 85 million smartwatches have been sold which will increase to 137 million in 2022 but the fitness tracker market dropped by 43 million to 39 million in comparison to the last four years. Predictions recommend that the global smart fashion market will reach 2.9 billion USD by 2022, based on the wide range of fashion clothes (tunic, dresses, etc.) and accessories (jewelry, watches, shoes, bags, etc).132 Huawei posted the largest annual growth among the market-leading vendors (Xiaomi, Fitbit, Garmin, Apple) presenting renewed fitness bands with several new models and an introduction to smart earwear with its sport pulse earphones that track heart rate as well as audio.335 Currently, Samsung, Google, Apple, HUAWEI and other companies have introduced smart devices. Their products have their own features including: health monitoring, information reminder, map navigation, connecting smart home and independent calls.336 The smart textile market is foreseen to develop due to the integration of the traditional clothing industry and electronics to create textiles and connected apparels for application in drug delivery, fitness, and clinical trials (Fig. 17b).337

4.4 Washable wearable generators
Electronic systems from conventional semiconductor materials are not an ideal choice for textile integration due to incompatible properties, including rigidity, bulk nature, wearability and the lack of washing durability.338 Therefore, all-fiber based generators are designed for use in wearable electronic devices. Significant factors including wicking properties, stretchability, air permeability and recovery require testing and control to provide user comfort. A general question concerning wearable electronics and all types of e-textiles is their washability.339 Textiles like any other materials when used for outdoor applications will be exposed to natural elements and require cleaning/washing at some point. Accordingly, the washing process effects need to be investigated in detail for polymeric piezoelectric wearable devices.38 Washability is one more key concern for the real personal application of electronic textiles which are expected to be similar to commonly worn clothes and for all-fiber based generators this ability is highly demanded. The influence of wear and tear, washing cycles and daily use also should be monitored to ensure piezoelectric response accuracy and provide a certain lifetime value for fabrics.28 The piezoelectric behaviour of polyamide-11, polypropylene and PVDF concerning the capability of peak-to-peak voltage generation after washing at 40 °C with the addition of detergent was investigated. The results showed that after the washing process the PA11 and PVDF yarns present higher peak-to-peak output voltage in comparison with the pristine specimen (Fig. 18a).18 A simple CF4 plasma etching treatment followed by immersion of the electrospun PVDF mats in water caused self-cleaning properties and superhydrophobicity. This would increase the durability of the smart textile and reduce the washing cycles when it is used. The established electrospun PVDF mat revealed ∼31% improvement in piezoelectric properties after surface modification (Fig. 18b).23 Melt-spun piezoelectric PVDF fibers with conductive cores were attached onto a textile glove to operate as a sensor. The washing effect on the electrical resistance of the printed interconnections showed that after 15 wash cycles the average surface resistivity was still below 500 Ω per square, which was supposed to be adequate for the operation of the polymeric sensor system during long-term use.340 The output voltage and current (∼110 V, 2 μA) stayed almost constant after 2 h washing of the PVDF fabric. Moreover, the electrical output performance showed very low degradation (∼106 V, 1.9 μA) following a 12 h washing process (Fig. 18c).31 After 10 times of washing, the PVDF output signals of the stitch-based sensor were well retained without a significant drop in current. After 50 times of washing, the current retention ratio was 97% which signifies the mechanical stability of the stitch sensor against repeated wash cycles (Fig. 18d).38 Water also can improve the electrical contact surface area among PVDF melt spun fibres and generate an output voltage of up to 8 V per step under wet conditions.41

4.5 Degradation and recycling of wearable generators
Continuously increasing world population has stimulated the advent of new technologies in lifestyle and fashion, which has led to fast growth in the textile industry from design to delivery resulting in less durable clothing which brings a dramatic increase in textile production consequently. Global per capita textile fiber production had an ∼120% growth trend over the years 1975 to 2018. This development in textile production is related to environmental challenges such as the availability of natural resources, textile production, emissions from the textile industry, and solid waste generation. The annual textile waste per person is about 40 kg and 19 kg for the United States and China respectively.341 Beside the fashion revolution, multitasking applications of textiles such as energy harvesting and signal detection increase the demand for more textile production which highlights the importance of textile recycling challenge. Waste electronics recycling in order to restore raw materials is beneficial for the environment, especially for electronic devices such as lithium-ion batteries (LiBs) including valuable metals (cobalt and lithium) as electro-active materials. Recycling of these resources is an important factor for the environment and there are many research studies in this respect.342 LiBs as an energy source contain toxic heavy metals at a high percentage. In 2005, 4000 t of used LiBs were collected where 28% and more that 5% heavy metals and toxic electrolytes were generated from them. Consequently more attention has been paid to technology development to recover and recycle LiBs for environmental protection and also conserve natural resources.343 Despite that many research focus on approaches for sustainable and green energy generation utilizing advanced smart piezoelectric materials specially PVDF polymer attract attentions.344 PVDF as a flexible piezoelectric polymer has a key role in the development of wearable technology, electric mobility and energy storage systems. The advances in these areas of research will bring about a rise in the textile market. This will reveal the urge to develop effective recycling facilities for this polymer. The PVDF polymer and its copolymers have been intensively studied owing to their excellent biocompatibility, amazing stability and unique physical/electrical properties which are attributed to their unique composition comprising hydrogen, carbon and fluorine functional groups.314 These constituent groups combine with each other in a highly robust matrix, providing both hydrogen and covalent bonds. Therefore, it is no wonder that why PVDF materials have not exhibited biodegradable characteristics unitl now.345 Poly-L-lactide polymer has the strategy for material processing, electromechanical analysis and device manufacturing to create a biodegradable, biocompatible piezoelectric force sensor to get FDA-implants approval implants.346 The biodegradation properties will possibly be identified for PVDF in the near future. Recycled PVDF hollow fiber membranes were fabricated using the dry–wet spinning technique. The decrease of PVDF molecular weight due to increasing running time also enabled recycled PVDF hollow fiber membranes to have higher porosity and better permeability.347 In fiber based wearable generators, beside PVDF, other part such as electrodes and connectors threads have textile based and need to recycle as well. Textile recycling mostly involves the reprocessing of the textile waste for use in new textile or non-textile products. Textile recycling methods are typically categorized into either chemical, mechanical or more rarely, thermal. With regard to the above-mentioned challenges, there is relevant interest in increasing textile recycling and reuse, which would take the treatment of textile waste one step further in waste classification, in accordance with the European Union legislation on waste streams (European Commission (EC), 2008). Textile recycling and reuse could potentially reduce the production of pure textile fibres and avoid engineering processes further downstream in the textile product life cycle, and consequently reduce environmental effects.348
5. Conclusion and perspective
The human-motion-based energy harvesting approach has gained great technological interest according to the increasing demand for portable smart electronics. Advanced electronics has low electric energy consumption so it is becoming more feasible to operate ultra-low-power devices. Unlike solar and thermal energies, harvesting energy from body motion does not depend on time and location. Human activities mainly rely on mechanical movement and they are a reliable and independent energy source. Harvesting energy from body movement during daily activities has a high potential to power up wearable electronic devices, which can make today personal life free from the messy connections of cables and wires. Wearable electronic devices normally comprise modules for communication and data analysis, a sensing network and a power source to provide energy for rechargeable batteries. It is desirable to replace batteries with energy harvested from the surrounding environment and body movement. Through a mechanical-to-electrical transformation mechanism, piezoelectric materials can be used for mechanical to electrical energy conversion. It is found that piezoceramics and piezopolymers are the two main categories of piezoelectric materials. Organic piezoelectric materials, such as PVDF have distinct features of chemical stability and flexibility, so they could facilitate the fabrication process of fiber-based devices. However, polymers have the limitations of a high electric field and low dielectric constant for the poling process. Inorganic piezoelectric materials, such as barium titanate, have higher piezoelectric coefficients than organic materials. Hence, to assemble more flexible devices, nano-sized inorganic piezoelectric materials are mixed with polymers to construct fibers. These devices also show a great capability to utilize the mechanical energy from body movement. The best form to harvest energy from human movement is through piezoelectric materials in the form of fibers which can be easily integrated into the garment as part of daily clothes. It is more desire that all components of smart textile have textile base, which is discussed in this review. Generally, there are two common methods for piezoelectric fiber fabrication: electrospinning and melt-spinning. The electrospinning process provides ready-to-use fibers although they require flexible metallic/metal electrodes for connection which limits their application and lifetime. In contrast, melt spun fibers need an additional post processing technique to enhance their piezoelectric behavior but the fibers have low-porosity which may result in contortion of their diameter. Consequently, making appropriate fibers from piezoelectric materials is a challenge for recent research. Fiber based structures are flexible, soft and deformed in three dimensions and hence they are appropriate as wearable piezoelectric generators. The stress level in fiber-based structures is low and tiny fibers are bent rather than compressed or stretched which prevents the piezoelectric effect. Moreover, fabric architecture design comes with a complex deformation mechanism. Fibrous structures provide a low-stress function and prevent crack propagation; indeed significant fatigue resistance and damage tolerance are desired features for fiber-based devices, while significant results are achieved from theoretical research on fiber-based piezoelectric generators, there is a huge gap between research and commercial uses. To improve the performance of these fibers as generators, they need to have durability and structural stability. For example, the piezoelectric performance of generators depends on environmental conditions, such as humidity, temperature and water/gas absorption. The piezoelectric effect is dominant at low temperature.349 As the humidity increases the output voltage decreases. At a higher humidity the piezoelectric potential would be reduced due to the increased conductivity of the piezomaterial.350 High-energy radiations such as neutrons and gamma rays can degrade piezoelectric materials. The mechanical properties and crystallinity of PVDF would be changed under irradiation conditions as a result of crosslinking reactions and chain scission.351 In addition, the sensitivity and output performance of devices need to be enhanced. The electrical output performance of piezo generators such as short circuit current, open circuit voltage, charging capacity and energy conversion efficiency are quite difficult to compare among different research studies. This is due to different test conditions such as applied load, environmental conditions, active area, different materials and operating mode. All these variables lead to confusion in finding the best design for piezoelectric generators and it cannot be a guideline for future research so appropriate standard evaluation is needed. Also due to researchers' tendency, the sensing ability352 of piezoelectric generators is more considered than sensing accuracy.37 The power output of fiber-based piezoelectric generators is significantly lower than the real need of most wearable devices. There are some approaches to increase the performance of piezogenerators such as increasing the effective area between the active material and electrodes which requires appropriate design, improving stiffness to transform more strain through the whole structure of the piezogenerator and get a better response353 and using hybrid energy harvesters as described before. Finally, the fiber needs to have the ability to be integrated in daily clothes in a user-friendly manner that does not cause inconvenience to users. The current issues related to wearable piezoelectric generators are: (i) low production capacity, long and slow processing techniques; (ii) low efficiency in power output; and (iii) inadequate integration methods. Research needs to be done in the following aspects and focus on the above mentioned issues to have an ideal fiber-based generator in terms of high output power and right feel of comfort for users:
(1) Improving output power in terms of performance and stability of fiber generators in various environments by understanding the charge transfer process and energy conversion mechanism.
(2) New functional materials, hybridization mechanisms and appropriate fillers with high energy conversion efficiency need to be examined to attain the best outcome, and the method and fillers should be cost-effective, have mass production capability and be environmentally friendly.
(3) Because of the final application of fibre-based generators which is integration into garments, it is better to combine piezoelectric, triboelectric and electrostatic effects to improve the performance of generators.
(4) Selecting appropriate electrodes based on the final application condition is another important factor. These electrodes must collect the charge from generators and transfer it to the target user. Therefore, these electrodes should have a suitable interface with the generator and also have internal resistance.
(5) Effectual packaging of the device for the integration of materials and electrodes in a textile based device plays a key role in providing a product with features of breathability, comfortability, and wearability.351
(6) There should be a capable system to harvest the power generated by the device and guide this energy to be used for final application. This system can be a lithium ion battery with low self-discharge and high energy density.
In the last five years, some new fabrication methods for fiber-based piezoelectric generators have been successfully developed focusing on output performance, device structure, materials, harvesting and storage interface circuit. To overcome all the challenges mentioned above we can have an ideal smart cloth to power portable electronics, and identify physiological responses for health monitoring which would cause a new textile industry revolution.
