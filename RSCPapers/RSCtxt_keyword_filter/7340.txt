    , Accepted 14th January 2022First published on 20th January 2022AbstractThis study presents series of direct band gap Pb-free double perovskite Cs2AgInxBi1−xCl6, Cs2NaxAg1−xInCl6:Bi and Cs2KxAg1−xInCl6:Bi nanocrystal systems [Cs2B′(I)B′′(III)Cl6] synthesised using a colloidal hot-injection route. The structural properties investigated using powder XRD, TEM, solid state NMR and materials modelling approaches demonstrate that the incorporation of K+ cations into the double perovskite nanocrystal structure occurs simultaneously on both the Cs (A) site and Ag (B′(I)) positions within a series of closely related cubic and monoclinic structures. As a result of defect passivation, significant improvements in the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of ∼4.7× and ∼1.8× are exhibited in comparison to the Cs2AgInxBi1−xCl6, and Cs2NaxAg1−xInCl6:Bi nanocrystal systems, respectively. Materials modelling using the Ab Initio Random Structure Search (AIRSS) method, and the GIPAW DFT calculation of the NMR parameters from the derived structural realisations, shows that K+ incorporation induces significant short-range structural disorder and multi-phase formation. This is highlighted by the large 133Cs and 39K chemical shift dispersion characterising the MAS NMR data. Density of States (DoS) calculations describing these AIRSS generated structures suggest that increasing ionic character and reduced structural rigidity are strongly correlated with A site substitution of the K+ cation into these cubic and monoclinic phases. The 39K MAS NMR data reveals that the increasing PLQY performance maps directly with the K+ incorporation into the cubic CsKyAg1−yInCl6 phase supporting B site occupancy which is observed to be maximized at a 60 ml% K+ incorporation level. However, additional evidence indicates that low level K+ substitution primarily targets A site occupancy in a surface passivation role. The improvement to the optical properties induced by K+ and Na+ incorporation is rationalised in terms of increased covalent character and structural rigidity associated with decreased Cs+, Na+ and K+ cation mobility, as evidenced by the large (∼2 orders of magnitude) variation in the 133Cs T1 data across each compositional range.
Introduction
Metal halide perovskite (ABX3) nanocrystals offer several advantages over bulk materials due to their thin emission linewidths, stable crystal structure due to the presence of passivation ligands, high photoluminescence quantum yield, high absorption cross-section, and surface functionality as a result of quantum confinement.1–5 The most efficient perovskite nanocrystals such as, CsPbX3 (X = Br, Cl, I), FAPbX3, MAPbX3, Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95PbX3 and Zn2+/CsPbBr3 demonstrate emission throughout the visible spectrum (400–760 nm) and high photoluminescence quantum yield, making these materials of high interest for optoelectronic applications.5–10 Light emitting diodes and solar cells based on these metal halide perovskites have shown excellent performance with efficiencies of nearly 25% power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells and 20% external quantum efficiency (EQE) of LEDs.4,11–19 However, these families of perovskites contain Pb which limits the commercial viability of these materials due to its environmental incompatibility and toxicity.17 The subsequent development of Pb-free perovskite systems has been extensive; however, the performance of these materials is inferior to their Pb-containing analogues.20,21 For example, Sn-based alternatives such as CsSnX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) offer one alternative, although the instability of the Sn2+ oxidation state, and its propensity to transform to the Sn4+ state under ambient conditions, destabilizes these systems.20 In addition, CsSnX3 nanocrystal systems do not exhibit the necessary quantum yields or local structural stability due to the presence of intrinsic crystal defects.22 The further development of Pb-free alternatives has explored the incorporation of other metal cations such as Sb, Bi and Cu, but these have not been fully examined to ascertain their suitability in optoelectronic applications.23–27
In contrast, Pb-free pure inorganic double perovskite structures such as indirect band gap Cs2AgBiCl6 and direct band gap Cs2AgInCl6 systems were recently investigated and found to have high structural stability under ambient conditions.24,28–30 While Cs2AgBiCl6 nanocrystal systems deliver low photoluminescence quantum yield due to the indirect band gap caused by its intrinsic properties,31,32 the direct band gap analogue Cs2AgInCl6 is a more suitable candidate for optoelectronic applications. This latter system has received widespread attention since the first report of its bulk structure.28–30,33 Locardi et al. were the first to report quantum confined Cs2AgInCl6 colloidal nanocrystals synthesised using a hot-injection route; these assumed a cubic Fmm crystal structure and demonstrated an experimental direct optical band gap of 4.7 eV.30 However, the photoluminescence quantum yield of Cs2AgInCl6 was found to be extremely low (1.6%) due to parity-forbidden transitions from the direct valence band maximum (VBM) to conduction band minimum (CBM) at the Γ point, as per the Laporte rule.34,35 Moreover, the large difference between experimental band gap (4.7 eV) and calculated band gap (2.7 eV) is also attributed to the fact that the direct band gap transitions are parity forbidden.30 However, bismuth doped Cs2AgInCl6 has been found to have less surface defects resulting in enhanced radiative localisation and thus increased photoluminescence quantum yield (∼11%) in the broad band orange spectral region.28,29 The cause of broad band emission can be attributed to the Jahn–Teller distortion of the [AgCl6]5− octahedron in excited molecular states, or due to the presence of self-trapped excitons.28,36 Nevertheless, the incorporation of Bi3+ in direct band gap Cs2AgInCl6 has led to improved optical properties. This has motivated many studies towards the substitution of the Cs2AgInCl6 framework with metal cations such as Na+, Ga+, Cr3+, Ce3+ and Sb2+ to find improved photoluminescence properties.37–43 Na+ doping in Cs2AgInCl6:Bi has significantly improved the photoluminescence quantum yield in bulk thin-films as well as nanocrystals up to 85% and 22%, respectively.39,40 However, there is still a need to precisely tune both the structural and optical properties of these systems formed through systematic doping of the metal cation. A recent study by Karmakar et al. has shown the importance of investigating the localised structural environments in Cs2Bi1−xInxAgCl6:Sb bulk materials and their relations to PL improvements.44 Investigations using the solid state NMR technique have demonstrated that direct observation of the atomic ordering phenomena of the B′′(III)/B′(I) octahedra is possible, thus allowing insights into how dopants are being incorporated into the double perovskite structure. More importantly, the local structure of Na+ and K+ doped Cs2AgInCl6 doped double perovskite nanocrystals have never been explored using solid state NMR; these are crucial developments that could underpin the improvement in the functionality of these materials.
In this work, series of Cs2AgInCl6 nanocrystals have been synthesized with varying amounts of Bi3+, Na+ and K+ cations incorporated using a colloidal hot-injection route. Initially, the structural and optical properties of Cs2AgInxBi1−xCl6 (x = 0.1–1) nanocrystal system have been investigated as a baseline material. Subsequent studies involved the synthesis and systematic characterisation of the Cs2AgxNa1−xInCl6:Bi (x = 0–1) and Cs2AgxK1−xInCl6:Bi (x = 0–1) series, where the powder XRD and multinuclear solid state NMR techniques were employed to interrogate the long range periodicity and short range localised structures comprising these materials, respectively. For the case of K+ incorporation, materials modelling using the Ab Initio Random Structure Search (AIRSS) method,45 and the calculation of the NMR parameters emanating from the generated structural realisations using the GIPAW DFT approach have been introduced to elucidate further insights from the interpretation of both the solid state NMR and powder XRD data.46–48 The effect of Na+ and K+ doping on the optical and structural properties of Cs2AgInCl6:Bi baseline nanocrystal systems has been investigated.
Results & discussion
Cs2AgInxBi1−xCl6 (x = 0–1) nanocrystal system
Nanocrystals were synthesised using a colloidal hot-injection route in which an appropriate quantity of acetate metal salts were dissolved in a reaction flask containing di-phenyl ether with suitable ligands followed by the hot-injection of benzoyl chloride into the reaction flask at 115 °C under inert atmosphere (see the Experimental section in the ESI‡ for details). Firstly, double perovskite nanocrystals with Cs2AgInxBi1−xCl6 (x = 0–1) composition were prepared as baseline materials to optimize the amount of bismuth. Powder X-ray diffraction data of Fig. 1a confirms the formation of a cubic Cs2AgInCl6 perovskite phase. As expected, Bi incorporation into the Cs2AgInCl6 structure expands the structural parameters, thus inducing a monotonic shift in the observed reflections towards lower angle (see Fig. 1b and c). As shown in Fig. 1d and S1a,‡ the TEM micrographs of the Cs2AgIn0.90Bi0.10Cl6 and Cs2AgIn0.50Bi0.50Cl6 nanocrystals depict the cubic morphology of these nanocrystals with average particle diameters of ∼17 nm and 15 nm, respectively. High resolution TEM micrographs of Fig. 1d exhibit resolved lattice fringes and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of cubic the nanocrystals corresponding to the (022) crystal plane of the perovskite framework. Overall, the matching of FFT and lattice spacing d with the (022) plane of XRD pattern validates the structure of these nanocrystal systems. Fig. 1e and f illustrate the absorption and PL characteristics from the Cs2AgInxBi1−xCl6 (x = 0–1) suite of nanocrystals, with the observed excitonic peak at 367–368 nm observed in all spectra resulting from direct s–p transitions as reported in previous studies on these nanocrystal systems.28,49 However, pure Cs2AgInCl6 nanocrystals exhibit a weak absorption at 360 nm together with a strong absorption feature below 300 nm attributed to the parity-forbidden direct transition in this material; this is an intrinsic property of the Cs2AgInCl6 system.23 In contrast, as demonstrated from Fig. 1f pure Cs2AgInCl6 nanocrystals do not exhibit photoluminescence behaviour as this system is an indirect band gap semiconductor. This observation is consistent with previous literature reports.28,50 As evident from the range of PL data exhibited in Fig. 1f, pure Cs2AgInCl6 shows a blue emission near 400 nm, however the introduction of Bi3+ at dopant levels as low as 0.5 mol% induces an orange emission at 581 nm which becomes red-shifted to 590 nm with increasing Bi3+ content. The images presented in Fig. 1g show the stimulated emission from the 100% and 90% In containing samples under 365 nm UV illumination, illustrating the change in emission colour with addition of dopant levels of Bi3+ in the perovskite structure. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of each nanocrystal sample was measured and it was found that the 90% In/10% Bi containing sample exhibited the highest PLQY of 8%, whereas the 99.5% In/0.5% Bi doped sample showed the second highest PLQY of 6%.

While it has been demonstrated that the incorporation of Bi3+ (even at dopant levels of 0.5 mol% Bi3+) improves the PLQY of these nanocrystals, it is important to observe from Fig. 1a and b that this dopant level substitution does not perturb the overall crystal structure and lattice parameters characterising the Cs2AgInCl6 nanocrystal system. Nevertheless, it still induces significant improvement in the PL properties including orange emission. Based on these characteristics Bi3+ doped preparations have been adopted for further compositional engineering in these nanocrystal systems, with previous reports proposing that the improvement in optical properties via Bi3+ incorporation could be due to improved short range crystalline order and excitonic localisation.28,51
The 133Cs solid state MAS NMR technique was implemented to examine the short range structural effects introduced by Bi3+ incorporation in the Cs2AgInxBi1−xCl6 (x = 0–1) compositional range. The data characterising these systems presented in the Fig. 2a–c, S2, and Table S1‡ exhibit similarities to those reported by Karmakar et al. who investigated the bulk materials structures; these assignments were adopted in order to assign the Cs speciation observed in the nanocrystalline materials.44 Each structure within the Cs2InxBi1−xAgCl6 compositional series can be described as Cs positions located in cubooctahedral environments surrounded by four [AgCl6]5− octahedra, alternating with four [InCl6]3− or [BiCl6]3− octahedra. The narrow 133Cs resonances characterising these data reflect the high point symmetry defining the Cs+ nearest-neighbour environments. From Fig. 2a the single resonances observed at δ 128 ppm and δ 82 ppm from the pure Cs2InAgCl6 and Cs2BiAgCl6 end members are ascribed to Cs+ cations surrounded by four [InCl6]3− or four [BiCl6]3− neighbouring octahedra, respectively. The 133Cs chemical shifts associated with the evolving Cs speciation within the intermediate Cs2InxBi1−xAgCl6 (x = 0.10–0.95) compositional series reflect the diverse combinations of Cs surrounded by [InCl6]3− and [BiCl6]3− octahedra. At the 50 mol% Bi3+ substitution level, five discrete Cs positions are observed. While the resonances at δ 87 ppm and δ 188 ppm are the shifted variants of the Cs2BiAgCl6 and Cs2InAgCl6 end member species, the three remaining 133Cs resonances at δ 109, 102 and 96 ppm are assigned to the four [InCl6]3− octahedra substituted by one, two and three [BiCl6]3− octahedra in neighbouring positions, respectively. The measured 133Cs chemical shifts are directly influenced by the varying quantities of the Bi3+ substituent on the In3+ position; as the Bi3+ content increases the 133Cs isotropic chemical shift becomes increasingly deshielded and moves linearly to higher frequencies/lower ppm due to the decreasing electron density at the Cs+ positions governed by the concomitant lattice expansion. This behaviour corroborates the PXRD study shown in Fig. 1b. Note that the 133Cs resonance linewidths exhibited in Fig. 2a and S2‡ broaden significantly at intermediate Bi3+ doping levels due to the increased local structural disorder induced by the dispersion of next-nearest-neighbour environments.

133Cs MAS NMR data (B0 = 14.1 T, νr = 12 kHz) from the Cs2InxBi1−xAgCl6 (x = 0–1) nanocrystal series showing, (a) the deconvolution, spectral simulations and resonance assignments indicating the different octahedral arrangements comprising each Cs environment (impurities are indicated by ‘†’), (b) and (c) the trends in the T1 relaxation times trends for each Cs environment. The 133Cs T1 relaxation times are determined by the saturation-recovery technique. 
The mobility of each Cs environment was investigated through the measurement of 133Cs of spin-lattice (T1) relaxation times, exhibited in Fig. 2b and c as a function of In3+ content in Fig. 2b and c. The very small electric quadrupole moment characterising the I = 7/2 133Cs nucleus, the absence of chemical shift variation with change of external B0 field, and the increase of the 133Cs linewidth with B0 (see Fig. S2 and Table S1‡) collectively indicate that the 133Cs MAS NMR linewidths are dominated by chemical shift dispersion. Furthermore, the 1/B0 dependence of the measured T1 values (see Table S1‡) suggests that these values are governed by a dipolar relaxation mechanism that is schematically represented in Fig. S3,‡ thus reflecting the dynamics and mobility characterising each Cs+ cation position.
From Fig. 2b it is important to observe that the Bi3+-rich compositions represented by the Cs2BiAgCl6 resonance (δ 83–88 ppm in Fig. 2a, denoted with a ♦ in Fig. 2b) and the In3+-rich compositions represented by the Cs2InAgCl6 resonance (δ 118–128 ppm in Fig. 2a, denoted with a ■ in Fig. 2b) exhibit 133Cs T1 values that are 2–3 orders of magnitude greater than the those representing the mid-range ∼50 mol% In3+ compositions. This result demonstrates that greater Cs+ mobility is facilitated by increased structural disorder generated in this region of the compositional range. The decrease in the measured 133Cs T1 values as the Cs2BiAgCl6 and Cs2InAgCl6 end-member compositions are approached suggests that small quantities of In3+ within the Cs2BiAgCl6 system, and Bi3+ within the Cs2InAgCl6 system, induce distinct passivation effects within these structures. Dopant-level incorporation of ∼0.5 mol% Bi3+ stimulates an increase in T1 from ∼290 to 720 s, thus highlighting the efficiency of this species in passivating structural defects and vacancies and restricting Cs+ mobility. This effect is correlated with the strong orange emission at ∼580 nm dominating the PL properties up to a composition of 99.5 mol% In3+ which subsequently disappears at 100 mol% In3+.
The 133Cs MAS NMR data spanning the intermediate compositional range (i.e. ∼25–75 mol% In3+) suggests that the Cs speciation is dominated by structural disorder defined by the relative nearest-neighbour octahedral substitution surrounding each Cs+ cation position. These environments are defined as 1[InCl6]3−,3[BiCl6]3−, 2[InCl6]3−,2[BiCl6]3− and 3[InCl6]3−,1[BiCl6]3− positions. Fig. 2c indicates that the Cs+ mobility and response to compositional change is inhomogeneous and complex; these data show the 133Cs T1 of the Bi3+-rich 1[InCl6]3−,3[BiCl6]3− environment to be invariant to composition, the Bi3+/In3+-neutral 2[InCl6]3−,2[BiCl6]3− environment varies marginally with composition, while the In3+-rich 3[InCl6]3−,1[BiCl6]3− exhibits a marked T1 variation of ∼460 s over the 25–90 mol% In3+ range. Like the passivation phenomenon demonstrated in the 99.5 mol% In3+ preparation (see above), this behaviour suggests that Cs+ cation mobility is actively reduced (i.e. T1s increase) with optimised passivation when Bi3+ concentrations are substantially reduced.
Cs2NaxAg1−xInCl6:Bi (x = 0–1) nanocrystal system
While the inclusion of dopant levels (∼0.5 mol%) Bi3+ into the nominal stoichiometry optimises the photophysical performance of the nanocrystal system without inducing major structural alteration, this strategy is adopted when further exploring substituted double perovskite nanomaterials. The Na+ cation has been reported to improve the PLQY in bulk preparations of other double perovskite systems,39 hence a logical progression to this investigation involves the synthesis of Cs2AgInCl6 nanocrystals with different mole percentages of Na+ incorporation onto the Ag+ site. Fig. 3a and b show the X-ray powder diffraction patterns of Cs2AgInCl6:Bi and Cs2NaInCl6:Bi nanocrystals which both crystallise into the cubic Fmm space group, while Fig. 3c and S4‡ demonstrate a linear trend in the expansion of the lattice parameter a with respect to increasing Na+ content. The TEM micrographs of these nanocrystals shown in Fig. 3d and e, and S1b‡ indicates a cubic morphology with an average particle diameter of ∼14 nm as calculated by a histogram analysis. A high resolution TEM image of Fig. 3e shows a lattice spacing of 3.7 Å corresponding to the (022) plane of the cubic double perovskite structure. These data closely match the TEM and XRD data of the baseline Cs2AgInxBi1−xCl6 nanocrystalline material as presented in Fig. 1a–d.

Fig. 4a and b show the 23Na and 133Cs solid state MAS NMR data, respectively, measured from the Cs2NaxAg1−xInCl6:Bi for (x = 0.2–1) series of nanocrystals. A single narrow resonance comprises each 23Na MAS NMR spectrum which is consistent with the high symmetry octahedral [NaCl6]5− environments in the cubic structure, as highlighted in the XRD study above. This resonance progressively becomes more shielded, shifting from δ ∼ 2.0 to δ ∼ 2.5 ppm with increasing Na+ incorporation. Similarly, a single narrow resonance is observed in each corresponding 133Cs MAS NMR spectrum verifying the high symmetry octahedral [CsCl6]5– environments; however, this resonance shifts from δ ∼ 128 to δ ∼ 121 ppm thus becoming more deshielded with increasing Na+ substitution. These opposing trends correlate with the emerging disorder in the nearest-neighbour octahedra upon increasing Na+ substitution which subsequently induces lattice expansion and a marked increase in the a lattice parameter (see Fig. 3c).
 Fig. 4  Solid state NMR study of the Cs2NaxAg1−xInCl6:Bi (x = 0.2–1) nanocrystal series showing (a) 23Na MAS NMR data (B0 = 14.1 T, νr = 12 kHz), (b) 133Cs MAS NMR data (B0 = 14.1 T, νr = 12 kHz), (c) 23Na T1 data, and (d) 133Cs T1 data. The T1 data was acquired using the saturation-recovery technique. The low-intensity resonance in the 133Cs MAS NMR data at δ ∼190 ppm denoted with a ‘†’ indicates the presence of a minor CsInCl4 impurity. 
From the 23Na and 133Cs T1 relaxation time behaviour presented in Fig. 4c and d, respectively, there exists ∼2–3 orders of magnitude difference between the magnitudes of the T1 relaxation times measured for the 23Na and 133Cs nuclei. These data indicate a far greater comparative mobility of Na+ cations within this structure which is consistent with its much smaller ionic radius (∼1.02 Å for Na+vs. ∼1.67 Å for Cs+) and propensity to avoid chemical/covalent interactions. Despite the 23Na nucleus possessing a much larger quadrupole moment than its 133Cs counterpart, the high cubic point symmetry ensures that the average 23Na quadrupole parameters are negligible, as evidenced by the invariant chemical shifts (δiso) with change in B0 (see Table S2‡). Hence, it can be inferred that a dipolar T1 relaxation mechanism is also dominant for this nucleus. Within experimental error the 23Na T1 relaxation times appear largely invariant over the entire compositional range. In contrast, the 133Cs T1 relaxation times appear largely invariant over the 20–60 mol% Na range, however the >60 mol% Na range exhibits a significant decrease in T1s of ∼300 s. As evidenced by the TEM EDXS data of Table S3,‡ a reduction in the Cs elemental ratio appears at 80 mol% Na indicating an increased Cs vacancy formation that is characterised by more rapid Cs+ cation mobility and reduced T1 relaxation times.

Fig. 5 shows the absorption and PL data obtained from the Cs2NaxAg1−xInCl6:Bi (x = 0.2–1) nanocrystal series. A blue shift in absorption peak from 370 nm to 324 nm is observed as the Na+ content increases from 0–100 mol%. It has been established that Na does not contribute to the valence band minima or conduction band maxima of the double perovskite band gap,33 hence only minute changes in the PL characteristics are observed with changing in Na content (see Fig. 5b). From Fig. 5b it is clear that Na doping enhances the emission in these nanocrystals; this phenomenon has been previously reported for the bulk perovskite.39 Luo et al. revealed that the increase in PLQY is due to the break in inversion symmetry of Cs2AgInCl6 by creating NaCl6 octahedra, allowing electron–hole overlap and subsequent radiative recombination.39 The emission mechanism is attributed to previously reported self-trapped exciton (STE) phenomena originating from Jahn–Teller distortion of [AgCl6]5– octahedra in the excited state.25,39,40Fig. 5b shows that the 100 mol% Na sample is not emissive, whereas the 60 mol% Na and 40 mol% Na demonstrated the highest PLQY values of 21% and 16%, respectively. A decrease in the PLQY for nanocrystals with compositions accommodating >60 mol% Na is attributed to onset of significant Cs vacancy formation and greater Cs+ mobility (see Table S4‡) which directly correlates with a significant decrease in the 133Cs T1 of ∼300 s depicted in Fig. 4d. These vacancies in the crystal structure can cause non-radiative transitions through phonon emission which are dominant in both the 80 mol% Na and 100 mol% Na nanocrystal systems.

Cs2KxAg1−xInCl6:Bi (x = 0–1) nanocrystal system
Although Na+ incorporation into the double perovskite system improves the optical and structural properties, other B′(I) possible cation substitutions can be realised to create alloys. Due to its compatible ionic radius, the K+ cation can be considered as a viable candidate for incorporation into the Cs2AgInCl6:Bi framework on the Ag+ position. A K+-substituted compositional series of the form of Cs2KxAg1−xInCl6:Bi (x = 0.2–1) was synthesized with a stoichiometry mirroring the Na+ series. In comparison to the Cs2InxBi1−xAgCl6 (x = 0–1) and the Cs2NaxAg1−xInCl6:Bi (x = 0.2–1) nanocrystal series which represent direct substitutional systems, the powder XRD data of Fig. 6 and the 133Cs and 39K MAS NMR data of Fig. 7 demonstrate that the Cs2KxAg1−xInCl6:Bi (x = 0.2–1) system is more complex where the formation of other similar phases competes for components of the K+ inventory.

The powder XRD data of Fig. 6a and S6‡ characterising the Cs2KxAg1−xInCl6:Bi (x = 0.2–1) nanocrystal series are refined as two similar crystal types consisting of a cubic perovskite phase (space group Fmm) and a monoclinic phase similar to the CsK2BiCl6 (space group C12/cl)52 or Cs2−xK1+xInCl6 (space group C2/c) structure types.53 The appearance of reflections at 29° and 34° 2θ in the 40 mol% K (see Fig. 6a) indicate the onset of a monoclinic phase; this phase assumes greater prominence with increasing mol% K+ (particularly at the 80 and 100 mol% K+ levels). Furthermore, Fig. 6b also shows that the cubic perovskite Fmm phase is described by a decreasing a lattice parameter with increasing mol% K+. As the ionic radius of K+ (1.38 Å) is larger than Ag+ (1.15 Å), the a lattice parameter of this cubic phase is expected to increase proportionally with K content as per Vegard's law.54 However, Fig. 6b demonstrates that the lattice parameter a decreases as the 20 mol% K level is exceeded, suggesting that the K+ cation is incorporated on both the Cs+ (A) and Ag+ (B′(I)) sites in this cubic structure. The TEM micrographs of the Cs2K0.60Ag0.40InCl6:Bi and Cs2K0.40Ag0.60InCl6:Bi nanocrystals in Fig. 6c and S1‡ reveal faceted particles of ∼4 nm and ∼6 nm diameter, respectively, while the HRTEM micrograph of Fig. 6d exhibit the lattice fringes and lattice spacing of 2.3 Å representing the (224) crystal plane associated with the cubic double perovskite structure. The smaller particle size characterising the K+ substituted nanocrystals is attributed to the comparatively slower reaction dynamics in the synthesis mixture.
From the TEM images of Fig. 6c and d, and SI1c,‡ the small nanocrystal size of ∼4–6 nm characterising the Cs2KxAg1−xInCl6:Bi (x = 0.2–1) series induces lower resolution XRD data (see Fig. 6a and S6‡). While the XRD data provides indications of the structural polytypes formed throughput this series, the short range information afforded by the solid state 133Cs and 39K MAS NMR data (see Fig. 7a–d), and the associated AIRSS materials modelling provide greater specificity to the evolving phases stimulated by the changing stoichiometry. As observed in Scheme 1, based on varying amounts of K+ cation substitution into the parent Cs2AgInCl6 structure,34 a broad range of crystalline structures were generated that exhibited considerable differences in the rigidity of the perovskite framework. In all these substituted systems, AIRSS modelling initiated a series of random InCl6 octahedra rotations and geometry relaxations to arrive at structural realisations representing lower energies in the potential energy surface than the original Fmm structure. From Scheme 1 the resultant families of cubic and monoclinic crystalline structures accommodate various degrees of octahedral tilting and distortion within each lattice. The parent structure Cs2AgInCl6 was found to be the most rigid, with the perfect Fmm structure defined as the ground state in these relaxation experiments. Substituting Cs+ atoms for K+ on the A site results in distorted structures that are energetically more favourable than the perfect cubic crystal, although the energy differences are not more than 15 meV per formula unit, thus indicating a flat potential energy landscape where the InCl6 octahedra have considerable rotational flexibility at finite temperatures. This phenomenon is emphasised upon inspection of the relaxed monoclinic Cs2−xK1+xInCl6 structure (A and B site K+ occupancy) which exhibits significant long-range disorder while preserving the overall local pseudo-cubic structure of the metal cations, thus corroborating the XRD data reported above.
 Scheme 1 
The partial density of states (DoS) calculated from the AIRSS generated structures shown in Scheme 1 are presented in Fig. 7a–f. From the evolution of the B site substituted cubic structures with increasing K+ incorporation depicted on the right side of Scheme 1, the calculated DoS progressing from the parent Cs2AgInCl6 system, to the partially substituted Cs2KyAg1−yInCl6 (B site occupancy, y = 0.5) through to the fully substituted Cs2KInCl6 (B site occupancy, y = 1) reveals a reduction and an eventual loss of covalent bonding character between the anionic Cl− and the B(I)+ cations upon K+ incorporation (see Fig. 7a–c). This rationalises the increased flexibility and ionic character of the system with increasing mol% K+ by highlighting that the isoenergetic relationship between the Cl− p electrons and the Ag+ d electrons (spanning ∼1.5–4.5 eV) underpinning Cs2AgInCl6 is replaced by a large energy displacement between the Cl− p electrons and the K+ p electrons in Cs2KInCl6 of ∼10 eV. Similarly, the DoS for the evolution of the A and B site substituted systems on the left side of Scheme 1 to the cubic Cs2−xKx+yAg1−yInCl6 and eventually the monoclinic Cs2−xK1+xInCl6 systems (see Fig. 7e and f) reflects the same loss of covalency and structural rigidity.
Calculation of the lattice parameters from the generalised cubic Cs2−xKx+yAg1−yInCl6 AIRSS realisation demonstrates that K+ substitution can be partitioned in two competing scenarios (see Fig. 7g). The lattice parameter changes from both A and B site substitution are represented as change to the average edge length of the (pseudo)cubic sublattice for monoclinic and cubic realisations of Cs2−xKx+yAg1−yInCl6. Observation of the orange curves show that by keeping the B site occupancy constant (i.e. y = 0.0, 0.5, 1.0) and varying the A site substitution, the lattice contracts in agreement with the XRD data of Fig. 6a and b. This contraction is accompanied by structural distortion which ultimately destabilises the cubic structure at high A site substitution levels. Conversely, the blue curves demonstrate that by keeping the A site occupancy constant (i.e. x = 0.0, 0.5) B site variation induces lattice expansion.
The 133Cs and 39K MAS NMR data measured from the Cs2KxAg1−xInCl6:Bi (x = 0.2–1) nanocrystal series is shown in Fig. 8a and b, while assignment of these complex spectra is assisted by GIPAW DFT calculation of the chemical shift distributions calculated from the AIRSS modelled structures of Scheme 1 (see Fig. 8c and d). An important feature to note from both the 133Cs and 39K MAS NMR data is that the parent cubic Cs2AgInCl6 and cubic (B site substituted) Cs2KyAg1−yInCl6 structures exhibit confined chemical shifts ranges at δ ∼ 128 ppm and δ ∼ 50 ppm, respectively, while all other systems display marked chemical shift distributions commensurate with the structural disorder defining the less rigid/more ionic systems. From the 133Cs MAS NMR data in Fig. 8a, the lower substitution levels of 20–60 mol% K+ are dominated by the cubic (B site substituted) Cs2KyAg1−yInCl6 species, although evidence of the cubic (A and B site substituted) Cs2−xKx+yAg1−yInCl6 and cubic (A site substituted) Cs2−xKxAgInCl6 systems is observed to emerge. Fig. 8a and c demonstrate that the substitution of K+ onto the Cs+ A site introduces significant structural disorder as reflected by the large GIPAW DFT predicted chemical shift dispersion spanning ∼80–100 ppm. The clearest experimental evidence of these disordered species is via the very broad, partially resolved (bimodal) resonance distributions centred at δ ∼ 150 ppm and δ ∼ 120 ppm (see Fig. 7c). At the higher 80 and 100 mol% K+ substitution levels the rigid/covalent cubic (B site substituted) Cs2KyAg1−yInCl6 structure disappears and the speciation is dominated by the less rigid/more ionic cubic (B site substituted) Cs2KInCl6 and monoclinic (A and B site substituted) Cs2−xK1+xInCl6 systems, in addition to the cubic (A and B site substituted) Cs2−xKx+yAg1−yInCl6 and (A site substituted) Cs2−xKxAgInCl6 systems mentioned above. The newly emergent cubic (B site substituted) Cs2KInCl6 and monoclinic (A and B site substituted) Cs2−xK1+xInCl6 systems are also characterised by complex disorder and broad predicted chemical shift ranges of ∼50 ppm and ∼80 ppm, respectively, which are thus partially resolved in the experimental data.

Unlike the Cs+ cation which only occupies the A site in this series of structures, the incorporation of the K+ cation on both the A and B positions introduces more profound affects to the observed 39K MAS NMR data of Fig. 8b. The A site and B site 39K shifts are partitioned into distinctly resolved chemical shift ranges, with the K speciation occupying the cubooctahedral A sites displaying 39K shifts in the δ ∼ –50–20 ppm range, while the octahedral B site substitution is comparatively less shielded exhibiting 39K shifts in the δ ∼ 50–80 ppm range. The component of the K inventory entering the rigid cubic Cs2KyAg1−yInCl6 structure (B site occupancy) is confined to a very narrow 39K chemical shift range around δ ∼ 50 ppm. It is important to note that the lower level (20 mol% K+) of incorporation does not introduce K+ cation speciation into B site of the cubic Cs2KyAg1−yInCl6 system; i.e. there is no evidence of a narrow resonance at δ ∼ 48 ppm, however, a broad distributed resonance centred around δ ∼ 20 ppm is observed. According to the GIPAW DFT calculated 39K chemical shift ranges of Fig. 8d, the K speciation delivered at the 20 mol% K+ incorporation level is distributed throughout disordered cubic (A site substituted) Cs2−xKxAgInCl6 and (A and B site substituted) Cs2−xKx+yAg1−yInCl6 phases. This represents a surface passivation phenomenon of the parent cubic Cs2AgInCl6 nanocrystals, with the corresponding (narrow) 133Cs MAS NMR resonance of the 20 mol% K+ system representing the Cs speciation comprising the Cs2AgInCl6 nanocrystal bulk. Despite the low signal/noise of the 39K MAS NMR data from the lower 20 and 40 mol% K+ incorporation levels, the absence of bimodal 39K chemical shift distributions suggests that a cubic (A site substituted) Cs2−xKxAgInCl6 phase dominates the surface K passivation. This observation is consistent with recent reports of the surface passivation of Cs2AgInCl6 and CsIn0.9Bi0.1AgCl6 nanocrystals using low levels of K+ cations introduced as KBr.55 The GIPAW DFT calculated 39K chemical shift distributions shown in Fig. 8d suggest that significant overlap influences both the A and B site shift ranges, precluding chemical resolution of the constituent cubic and monoclinic phases in each case. However, more importantly, the distinct resolution between the A and B site chemical shift ranges demonstrates that the K+ substitution levels into this nanocrystal series (particularly at the higher incorporation levels) is dominated by A site occupancy by a factor of ∼2.5–4.0 (see Table S5‡).
Despite the large 133Cs and 39K linewidths and lack of resolution that characterises the structural disorder within K+ substituted nanocrystal series, valuable information can be obtained from the T1 relaxation data from those resonances that can be isolated. From the 133Cs MAS NMR data three distinct resonances at δ ∼ 128 ppm (cubic (B site substituted) Cs2AgInCl6/Cs2KyAg1−yInCl6 phases), δ ∼ 152 ppm (convoluted cubic (A site substituted) Cs2−xKxAgInCl6 and cubic (A and B site substituted) Cs2−xKx+yAg1−yInCl6 phases) and, δ ∼ 82 ppm (convoluted cubic (fully B site substituted) Cs2KInCl6 and monoclinic (A and B site substituted) Cs2−xK1+xInCl6 phases) exhibit sufficient resolution for a T1 relaxation analysis. The measured 133Cs T1 relaxation data is reported as a function of mol% K+ incorporation in Fig. 7h and Table S4.‡ These data highlight differences of over two orders of magnitude exists between the 133Cs T1s characterising the rigid (cubic (B site substituted) Cs2AgInCl6/Cs2KyAg1−yInCl6 phases, T1s of ∼250–500 s) and the more disordered and flexible structures represented by broader resonance linewidths (T1s of ∼5–20 s), thus corroborating the DoS data presented in Fig. 7a–f. Fig. 8h displays a noticeable decrease in the 133Cs T1s at the 40 mol% K+ incorporation level. As the 20 mol% K incorporation level probably only represents a surface passivation event (see the 39K MAS NMR data above), the T1 measurement of ∼500 s from this sample represents Cs+ cations in the bulk Cs2AgInCl6 structure. Hence, the reduced T1 of ∼250 s at 40 mol% K represents the initial K+ cation introduction into the Cs2AgInCl6 framework, which is probably distributed inhomogeneously throughout quasi-stable surface, sub-surface and near-surface environments of the nanocrystal (see the 39K MAS NMR data of Fig. 8b). As evidenced by the 39K MAS NMR data of the 60 mol% K preparation, the increase of the 133Cs T1 back to ∼500 s is accompanied by the maximum proliferation of K+ into the bulk Cs2AgInCl6 framework (producing the B site substituted Cs2KyAg1−yInCl6 phase), suggesting that the substituted Cs2K0.60Ag0.40InCl6 phase represents an important balance between covalent character, restricted Cs+ mobility and K+ incorporation (see Fig. 8b).

Fig. 9a and b show the absorption and emission data from the Cs2KxAg1−xInCl6:Bi (x = 0.2–1) nanocrystal series. From Fig. 9a, a blue shift in the excitonic peak spanning 370 nm to 328 nm is observed across this compositional range; however, there is no apparent shift in the PL peak as K+ cations do not perturb the valence band maxima or conduction band minima of the double perovskite band gap (see Fig. 9b).33Fig. 9c shows the relative PL performance from the Cs2AgIn0.90Bi0.10Cl6, Cs2Na0.60Ag0.40InCl6:Bi, and Cs2K0.60Ag0.40InCl6:Bi nanocrystal samples that present the highest PLQY within each compositional series, demonstrating that the K+ substituted Cs2K0.60Ag0.40InCl6:Bi nanocrystals represent the best performing systems by a factor of ∼100%. More importantly, Fig. 9d indicates that K+ incorporation induces significant improvements to the optical properties specifically at the 60 mol% K level where the PLQY increases from 38%. Indeed, Fig. 9d and e show that the increasing PLQY performance of the K+ substituted series correlates directly with amount of the cubic (B site substituted) Cs2KyAg1−yInCl6 phase present which is maximized at the 60 mol% K level. Although the XRD, MAS NMR and materials modelling studies reveal that compositions supporting >20 mol% K accommodate simultaneous K+ substitution on both the A (Cs) and B′(I) (Ag) double perovskite positions, Fig. 9d and e emphasize that the 60 mol% K preparation optimises the presence of the cubic (B site substituted) Cs2KyAg1−yInCl6 phase that shows the most effective passivation of the Cs+ bulk and surface defects as indicated by the longest 133C and 39K T1 values (see Fig. 7h), attenuated cation mobility and enhanced PLQY performance. From the XRD data of Fig. 6a and S6,‡ and the 133Cs and 39K MAS NMR of Fig. 8a and b, respectively, increased K+ incorporation of >60 mol% K induces the formation of large quantities of disordered cubic and monoclinic phases where A site substitution dominates the K speciation. These less rigid/more ionic phases are characterised by greatly reduced T1s, increased cation mobility and much reduced PLQY function.

The PLQY behaviour demonstrated by the K substituted series in (d) directly correlates with the amount of cubic Cs2KyAg1−yInxCl6 phase represented by the δ 48 ppm resonance from the 39K MAS NMR data in (e) and in Fig. 7b (maximum indicated with an asterisk *). 
It is important to note that a direct observation of the optical band gaps in these types of materials are difficult to observe experimentally. As discussed in ref. 35, this is a consequence of the transitions between the valence band maximum to the conduction band minimum being parity forbidden. The complexity of these processes is highlighted by the theoretically calculated and measured data presented in the manuscript Fig. 1f, g, 5a, b, 7a–f, and 9a, b, and in Fig. S9 and Table S6 within the ESI.‡ A qualitative estimate from the PLQY data for all nanocrystal systems in this study places most band gaps in the ∼1.5–2.2 eV range which is in reasonable agreement with the band gap values elucidated from the first principles band structure/DoS calculations presented in Fig. 7. Similarly, the calculated absorption spectra for Cs2AgInCl6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 nanocrystal systems shown in Fig. S6,‡ also determined from first principles band structure data, semi-quantitatively corroborates the experimentally measured absorption data from these materials (see top and bottom spectra from Fig. 1f). However, this contrasts with the Tauc plot estimation of the band gaps for all UV/vis absorption spectra as presented in Table S6‡ which, (a) demonstrate minor variation with composition, and (b) represent a significant overestimation in comparison to the calculated results. For the Tauc plot estimations, the band gap is calculated using a direct band gap of these materials as the actual fundamental band gap is more complex as it is comprised of parity forbidden direct and indirect transition processes. Although emission transitions are not necessarily prevented, the excited electron–hole pair may have a long lifetime thus affecting the efficiency of the emission. It is assumed the introduction of structural disorder and symmetry reduction partially allows parity-forbidden transitions, thereby increasing the overall PL efficiency in both absorption and emission modes.
Similar improvements to the optical properties by surface passivation have been reported from the incorporation of K+ cations into other ABX3 perovskite systems.56 It is important to note that a measured PLQY of 38% for the 60 mol% K system represents a maximum theoretical threshold as the uncoordinated Cl− ions on the nanocrystals surface limit the emission efficiency in double perovskite structure.57 While further developments are necessary to improve the PLQY in these nanocrystal systems, this XRD/MAS NMR/materials modelling approach has demonstrated that K+ cation incorporation induces the evolution of multiple phases associated with simultaneous A and B site passivation. Furthermore, the K+ cation substitution series shows a clear dominance of the A site substitution phenomenon (particularly at the higher incorporation levels); however, the PLQY performance is optimised when the maximum amounts of the cubic (B site substituted) Cs2KyAg1−yInCl6 phase comprises the nanocrystal structure. Hence, clearly beneficial developments in this nanocrystalline double perovskite material system would involve increased relative yields (or complete dominance) of the Cs2KyAg1−yInCl6 phase.
Conclusion
Three series of nanocrystal samples, Cs2InxBi1−xAgCl6, Cs2NaxAg1−xInCl6:Bi, and Cs2KxAg1−xInCl6:Bi, were synthesised using a colloidal hot-injection procedure. Cs2AgInxBi1−xCl6 nanocrystals were synthesised as a baseline system, with the 0.5% Bi doped sample (Cs2AgInCl6:Bi) being taken forward for investigations of the Na+ and K+ cation incorporation into these double perovskite nanocrystalline materials. A combined XRD, TEM and solid state MAS NMR approach demonstrated that clear structural and functional trends were observed for the Cs2InxBi1−xAgCl6 (x = 0–1) and Cs2NaxAg1−xInCl6:Bi (x = 0–1) substitutional series. The Cs2InxBi1−xAgCl6 (x = 0–1) series exhibited 133Cs T1 values that are 2–3 orders of magnitude greater than the those representing the mid-range ∼50 mol% In3+ compositions thus reflecting increased Cs+ mobility where maximum structural disorder is present. In contrast, the maximum measured 133Cs T1 values were evident for compositions close to (but not directly at) the end member Cs2BiAgCl6 and Cs2InAgCl6 compositions, suggesting that minor substituted amounts of In3+ in the Cs2BiAgCl6 system, and Bi3+ within the Cs2InAgCl6 system, induce marked passivation effects within this system. This phenomenon is highlighted by the strong orange emission at ∼580 nm dominating the PL properties up to a composition of 99.5 mol% In3+, but which subsequently disappears at 100 mol% In3+.
The Cs2NaxAg1−xInCl6:Bi (x = 0–1) nanocrystal series highlights the complementary and interconnected roles that the cations such as Bi3+ and Na+ adopt within this nanocrystalline framework. The larger and more highly charged Bi3+ cation is clearly essential for defect passivation which assists the attenuation of the Na+ cation mobility up to the 60 mol% Na+ incorporation level where a maximum PLQY of 21% is achieved. At higher Na+ substitution levels (i.e. >60 mol% Na+) the effectiveness of the Bi3+ cation passivation is decreased and a concomitant reduction in the Cs elemental ratio develops as detected by the TEM EDXS data (see Table S3‡). This facilitates increased Cs+ vacancy formation and more rapid Cs+ and Na+ cation mobility as characterised by reduced 133Cs and 23Na T1 relaxation times.
The Cs2KxAg1−xInCl6:Bi (x = 0–1) nanocrystal series behaves in similar fashion to its analogous alkali Na+ series as the Bi3+ passivation helps to restrict K+ mobility up to the 60 mol% K+ level where a maximum PLQY of 38% is obtained. This performance represents a maximum theoretical threshold for these materials as the uncoordinated Cl− ions on the nanocrystals surface limit the emission efficiency in double perovskite structure,57 nevertheless it is highly suitable for optoelectronic applications including photovoltaic and light emitting devices. Once again, this behaviour is indicated by the 39K T1 measurements that are maximised at this substitution level. However, in marked contrast to the Na+ nanocrystal series, the smaller ionic radius of the K+ cation also stimulates the formation of a complex array of competing, closely related K+ substituted phases. XRD studies demonstrated that cubic and monoclinic phases co-exist in the nanocrystal structure, while solid state 133Cs and 39K MAS NMR studies, AIRSS materials modelling and GIPAW DFT chemical shift calculations verified the specific cubic and monoclinic phases present. All of these studies conclusively proved that K+ incorporation in these nanocrystals can occur on both A and B′(I) positions of the double perovskite structure, and the DFT DoS calculations identified that varying degrees of covalent/ionic character and structural rigidity characterise the resultant phases. Optimum PL and PLQY behaviour were observed with maximum amounts of the structurally rigid 60 mol% K+ Cs2KyAg1−yInCl6 phase that support B site occupancy, although the lower concentration preparations show clear evidence that the K+ incorporation is initiated as surface passivation primarily on the A site. These findings involving K+ substituted double perovskite Cs2InAgCl6 quantum dot systems have great implications, not only for optoelectronic and solar cell technologies, but also for the developing fields of photocatalytic CO2 reduction and image sensor materials.58,59
