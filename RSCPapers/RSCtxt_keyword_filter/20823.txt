    , Accepted 23rd October 2017First published on 24th October 2017AbstractEarth abundant compounds are of interest as a possible alternative to more mature thin film based technologies. Cu2SnZnSe4 (CZTS) is the most studied material but its development is impeded by an easy formation of secondary phases, decomposition effects during both synthesis and post process treatments, and formation of Cu–Zn defects resulting in limited device performance. In this context, Cu2SnS3 (CTS) is an interesting substitute with suitable optoelectronic properties and a wider stable composition range with fewer constituents hence (avoiding Zn related defects). Currently the technology is still in an early stage of development with a 4.63% record efficiency (6% with an alloy with Ge) and faces serious issues related to the formation and coexistence of different polymorphic/stoichiometric phases indicating that precise composition control and phase identification are still needed. In this work, an analysis of CTS thin film absorbers is presented. A comparative study by X-ray diffraction profile refinement and Raman spectroscopy allowed the assessment of both cubic and monoclinic CTS phases formed at different annealing temperatures. In addition Raman analysis of precursors sulfurized at different temperatures revealed a blue shift as well as a reduction of the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the two dominant peaks for temperatures close to 550 °C, which is interpreted as a CTS phase transition in the absorber layer. This alteration was also correlated with the optoelectronic properties of devices. A higher Voc and Jsc are obtained for samples with 30% monoclinic CTS phase concentration which led to a record efficiency of 2.4%. It is then assumed that higher efficiencies could be achieved for a pure monoclinic CTS layer. In this sense, a non-destructive methodology for the fast evaluation of cubic Cu2SnS3 formation at the surface is proposed.
Introduction
Earth abundant compounds have become of interest over the past few years as a possible alternative to the commonly used thin film based technologies such as Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) and Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGS). New kinds of non-toxic, cheap and abundant absorbers have been manufactured recently, CZTS (Cu2SnZn(S,Se)4) being the leading material of this branch with a record efficiency of 12.6%.1 Other compounds are also considered as potential good photovoltaic absorbers such as Cu2SnSe3 (CTSe) and Cu2SnS3 (CTS). As they are composed of only three earth abundant elements, their use enables further cost savings and simpler synthesis processes while maintaining some of CZTS advantages. CTS in particular stands out for its high absorption coefficient (higher than 104 cm−1), direct band gap around 1 eV, p-type conductivity and reasonably good electrical properties.2 Cu2SnS3 solar cells have been successfully produced by different methods of synthesis such as pulsed laser deposition (0.82%), chemical bath deposition (1%), and reactive annealing of the sputtered precursor (2.92%) and a record efficiency of 4.29% has been achieved by co-evaporation.3–6 The use of dopants has yielded to the highest efficiencies achieved with this material so far. In this regard, the use of NaF in sequential evaporation resulted in a CTS cell with a 4.63% conversion efficiency and the use of Ge in (Cu2(Sn1−xGex)S3) alloys with x = 0.17 by co-sputtering led to a remarkable record efficiency of 6%.7,8
However, the formation of a pure CTS absorber presents two main problems. On the one hand, the presence of multiple stoichiometries like Cu2Sn3S7, Cu3SnS4 and Cu4SnS4 hampers obtaining a pure Cu2SnS3 phase.9 On the other hand, a Cu2SnS3 compound possesses different structural polymorphs (tetragonal, cubic, monoclinic and triclinic).10–13 Even if there is not a consensus about the process conditions of their synthesis, it is generally accepted that for temperatures lower than 400 °C a tetragonal CTS structure is observed while above 400 °C a mix of cubic (c-CTS) and monoclinic (m-CTS) polymorphs is detected.10,14–16 In this temperature range the measured band-gap energies vary between 0.9517 to 1.11 eV18 for the cubic/monoclinic structures. For temperatures higher than 500 °C it is commonly accepted that the monoclinic structure predominates and that a band gap at 0.93 eV together with another optical transition at 1.0 eV is observed.6,19,20
In this context, our work aims to bring some insights first about CTS and the characterization of its polymorphs using XRD and Raman spectroscopy and secondly about the impact of polymorphism on the optoelectronic properties of CTS based devices. In fact, even if it is mostly acknowledged that CTS solar cell efficiency really depends on the type of CTS polymorph synthesized, to our knowledge there is not a systematic study of the cubic phase presence in the monoclinic CTS absorber, and its impact on device performances. To do so, this paper focuses on three points: first a structural study of the synthesized samples is performed by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) profile refinement analysis and Raman spectroscopy. Identification and description of the different CTS polymorphs are proposed, and semi quantitative evaluation of the cubic/monoclinic concentration is proposed. We emphasize the relationship between the existence of these polymorphs and the sulfurization temperature and demonstrate the presence of a predominant cubic CTS phase in 2.4% devices synthesized at high temperature (575 °C). The second point is focused on the development of two methods based on Raman spectroscopy for cubic/monoclinic concentration assessment. Finally, the concentrations assessed by those methodologies are correlated with the optoelectronic parameters of the corresponding devices. They depict a clear correlation between better performances and the reduction of c-CTS phase content.
Experimental part
CTS absorbers were synthesized by a sequential process consisting of the deposition of metallic copper (Cu) and tin (Sn) layers by sputtering, followed by thermal annealing in a reactive atmosphere. Metallic Cu/Sn/Cu stack precursors were deposited onto a molybdenum (Mo) coated soda-lime glass substrate. The overall thickness was selected in order to obtain copper poor conditions with a Cu/Sn ratio of about 1.8.21 Both the thickness and composition of the precursors were assessed by X-ray fluorescence (XRF; Fisherscope XDV). The metallic stacks were introduced into a graphite box (23 cm3) with crucibles containing sulfur (S) (Alfa-Aesar, 99.995%) and Sn powder (Alfa-Aesar, 99.999%) and submitted to an annealing process in a standard tubular furnace. The quantity of sulfur was such that all annealing processes were performed under sulfur-poor conditions which has been reported first to reduce Sn loses during the growth of the absorber by preventing the formation of the Cu3SnS4 phase22 and secondly to be a way to achieve the desired carrier concentrations in CTS solar cells.21 A two-step thermal profile has been used with a first annealing at 350 °C for 30 min (heating ramp 30 °C min−1, argon pressure of 850 mbar) followed by a second step at temperatures varying between 500 and 575 °C, during 15 min (heating ramp 30 °C min−1, argon pressure 1 bar). Then the furnace was naturally cooled down to room temperature. Under these annealing conditions, samples with different contents of monoclinic and cubic phases were synthesized.
Afterwards, the absorbers were subjected to (NH4)2S etching for 30 seconds in order to remove possible Sn–S secondary phases at the surface.23 Solar cells were completed by depositing a CdS buffer layer (50–60 nm) by Chemical Bath Deposition (CBD) and i-ZnO/ITO layers by pulsed DC-sputtering. 3 × 3 mm2 solar cells were scribed using a micro-diamond scriber (MR200 OEG). Dark and illuminated J–V curves (AM1.5 illumination conditions) were measured using an Abet Technologies Sun 3000 Class AAA solar simulator.
XRD measurements were performed by means of a PANalytical X'Pert PRO MPD alpha1 diffractometer in a Bragg–Brentano θ/2θ configuration using Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), selected by means of a Johansson type Ge (111) focusing primary monochromator and an X'Celerator silicon strip 1D detector (active length of 2.113°). 2θ scans were obtained from 10 to 145° with a step size of 0.0166° and measuring time of 200 seconds per step. An automatic divergence slit system and a mask enabled a constant irradiated surface (10 × 12 mm2) over the analysed sample. The diffracting volume was constant over all the measured angular ranges taking into account the finite thickness of the analysed thin film. During the measurement, samples were rotated at 30 RPM speed. Rietveld and Le Bail pattern matching refinements were performed using FullProf suite.24
Raman scattering measurements were performed in a back scattering configuration using a highly sensitive Raman apparatus developed at IREC and made of a Horiba Jobin Yvon iRH320 spectrometer coupled with a low noise CCD detector cooled at −70 °C. In this system, excitation and light collection were performed through a macro optic system with a laser spot diameter of about 70 μm. Back-scattering measurements were performed at a 633 nm excitation wavelength by focusing the laser spot directly onto the layer surface which allows the assessment of the absorber layer without any contribution from the ITO/ZnO/CdS upper layers.25 Excitation power was kept below 26 W cm−2 in order to avoid the presence of thermal effects in the spectra. The first-order Raman spectrum of monocrystalline silicon (Si) was measured as a reference before and after each Raman spectrum acquisition, and spectra were corrected by imposing first order Si at 520 cm−1.
Results
Structural and vibrational characterization of CTS

Fig. 1 depicts the XRD diffractograms of samples processed at the lowest (500 °C) and highest (575 °C) temperatures during this work. The qualitative analysis of the diffractograms shows that for both temperatures, a low value of Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the main peaks is achieved suggesting the synthesis of a main phase of high crystalline quality. However for each temperature, the phases detected are quite different. For the high temperature case, peaks at 16.1°, 18.2°, 21° and 24.5° are observed. These peaks are specific to the m-CTS phase (space group Cc, diffraction planes 110, 11, 210 and 111).19,26 In the case of the sample annealed at a low temperature (500 °C), they are not observed which suggests the preferential formation of a c-CTS phase (space group 43m).26 However due to the strong structural similitude of these two phases, it remains difficult to evaluate their coexistence or not without performing a detailed profile refinement which is presented in the next paragraph. In addition to the CTS phase, other contributions are detected. In both samples a weak Sn contribution (only considered in the reported Rietveld refinements in the case of 500 °C, less than 0.5% obtained) is seen as well as a broad band at 2θ = 16.1° that has been tentatively identified as a MoxS phase (Mo2.06S3e.g., 1-72-821). The presence of these contributions suggests a partial sulfurization of the metallic stack regardless of the sulfurization temperature. Additional weak contributions are observed for each sample: for the 500 °C case, contributions at 14.6°, 28.5°, 34.5°, 45.2° and 49.4° indicate the minor presence (estimated to be less than 1% by profile refinement analysis) of a rhombohedral Cu4Sn7S16 phase. It is stoichiometrically similar to the monoclinic Cu2Sn3S7 phase, and the main diffraction pattern is very similar, reported previously by Cheng et al.27 and also synthesized at low temperature (400 °C). For the 575 °C case, peaks at 9.62°, 19.24°, 39.11° (d spaces of 9.2, 4.6, 3.07, 2.30 Å) are observed but not identified. These peaks have been observed by different authors in CTS samples but their identification remains difficult. Nevertheless, the equispacial distance between the peaks suggests that they are the reflections of the different orders of the same (hkl) diffracting plane of a non-identified phase with a strong preferential orientation.

The asterisk symbols indicate unidentified peaks while black arrows indicate peaks whose intensity has been cut in order to emphasize the weak contributions. 
As mentioned before, a semi-quantitative estimation of the identified phases in the absorber layers has been carried out in both samples combining Rietveld refinements28 for the CTS polymorphs and Le Bail pattern matching refinements29 for the Mo phase. In Fig. 2 shows the profile refinement plots obtained for both samples while Table 1 summarizes the analysis results. The refinement results of the m-CTS phase are in agreement with reported Rietveld refinement analysis of powder samples.26,30

According to the profile refinement analysis of both samples, the dominant phase is the cubic CTS. For high temperature, the absorber layer is constituted by 30% of monoclinic CTS whereas at lower temperature, this phase is not detected. Grazing incidence measurements performed in the high temperature annealed sample (not shown) confirm that the sample is homogenous in depth, in terms of concentration ratio between monoclinic and cubic CTS phases. A comparison between high and low annealing temperatures shows that the monoclinic contribution rises to the expense of the cubic phase as the temperature increases. This observation is in agreement with the ones reported in previous works.6,19,20 However in our case, the monoclinic phase content for such a high temperature remains quite low compared to what is reported in other works where a pure or close to pure monoclinic phase is observed.13,16,31,32 This difference could be related to the relatively low sulfur pressure used during the annealing.
In order to give additional insights, Raman spectroscopy analysis was performed on complete devices (glass/Mo/CTS/CdS/ZnO/ITO) using a 633 nm laser as a source of excitation. This technique is useful in this particular case as each CTS polymorph has a Raman spectrum with distinctive features. In fact from the vibrational point of view, for the monoclinic CTS structure (space group Cc) thirty three Raman active modes (16A′ ⊕ 17A′′) are predicted.33 In the case of the cubic structure (space group 43m), one triple degenerated Raman active mode is predicted. For both structures all Raman active modes are also infrared active, leading to their LO–TO splitting. Thus up to sixty six and two peaks are expected in the Raman spectra for the monoclinic and cubic structures, respectively. Experimentally, Fernandes et al.13,34 have identified the main Raman modes of cubic CTS to be located at 303 cm−1 and 355 cm−1, whereas Berg et al. reported monoclinic CTS Raman peaks at 290 cm−1 and 352 cm−1.35
In Fig. 3, Raman spectra of samples annealed at 575 °C (Fig. 3(a)) and 500 °C (Fig. 3(b)) as well as their fitting using minimum required Lorentzian curves are presented. In the case of a high temperature annealing, ten peaks are resolved: two dominant at 291.8 and 354.1 cm−1, and eight of weaker intensity at 225.6, 249.3, 260.2, 268.1, 313.9, 321.3, 372.9, and 378.8 cm−1. Table 2 summarizes the peak positions obtained in this work together with what has been reported in the literature. The good agreement between the Raman spectrum observed in this work for the high temperature annealing case with previous studies (Table 2) led to the identification of all Raman peaks as monoclinic CTS phase modes. However it contrasts with the XRD semi-quantification where it has been estimated that the absorber bulk was constituted of only 30% monoclinic phase and 70% cubic phase. This contradiction between XRD and Raman spectroscopy analyses could be explained by the low Raman efficiency of the cubic phase. This issue has already been reported by Fernandes et al. who observed a low signal/noise ratio for the Raman spectra of c-CTS compared to the ones from m-CTS.13 In the case of the sample annealed at low temperature, clear modifications of the peak intensity, Raman shift position and FWHM are observed. The position of dominant peaks is halfway between pure monoclinic (reported at 290 and 352 cm−135) and pure cubic (reported at 303 and 355 cm−113) phase positions. These positions are attributed to a mix of both phases with an overlapping of Raman peaks which has already been seen in previous studies.31 It is interesting to note that while by XRD measurements and profile refinement, no evidence of m-CTS is detected for an annealing at low temperature in our sample, by Raman spectroscopy a small contribution of m-CTS is observable. It demonstrates once again the high Raman efficiency of the m-CTS phase which allows its detection even at low quantities. Additionally, this result suggests that the semi-quantification obtained by profile refinement could overestimate the cubic phase concentration.

The subtraction of the high temperature Raman spectrum from the low temperature one (I (500 °C)–I (575 °C)) resulted in providing a preliminary Raman spectrum fingerprint of the cubic CTS phase. By fitting the subtracted spectrum Fig. 3(c), a deconvolution of eight peaks at 222.2, 258.6, 270.4, 301.3, 320.0, 343.7, 359.3, and 375.1 cm−1 was obtained (Table 1). A good agreement of the main peaks (at around 300 and 359 cm−1) with the cubic CTS reference spectrum reported by Fernandes et al.13 is obtained where the same Raman spectrum fingerprint can be observed although the position of main peaks is slightly different which is attributed to a difference in crystal quality. Finally the small contributions of Cu4Sn7S16 and Cu2Sn3S7 phases whose main Raman peaks have been reported to be at 350 cm−136 and at around 318 and 377 cm−127,35 respectively, have been detected. Hence it is worth mentioning that the small contributions at 320.0 and 375.1 cm−1 detected in the subtracted spectrum could be related to the Cu4Sn7S16 phase.
Methods for CTS cubic phase assessment in CTS absorbers
Cu–Sn precursors sulfurized at different temperatures were further analyzed by Raman spectroscopy and spectra are presented in Fig. 4(a). Depending on the sulfurization temperature, clear differences can be observed: by increasing the sulfurization temperature, a red shift and a reduction of the FWHM of the two most intense peaks are observed together with a variation of peak intensity. These peaks come from the overlapping of both cubic and monoclinic Raman contributions. Hence their modification is directly linked to changes of both the monoclinic and the cubic phase content induced by temperature variation. The formation of a cubic structure for temperatures lower than 500 °C and formation of a monoclinic structure for annealing temperatures close to 600 °C have been well documented and reported by previous works using XRD and Raman spectroscopy,13,16,31 but the transition and phase coexistence are not well studied yet, due to the difficult identification of each phase. Moreover the dependence of Raman spectra features on CTS polymorph concentrations can be used as a method for determining these polymorph contents in the absorber layer. Two methods are proposed: the first one monitors the ratio of the areas of different regions whereas the second one focuses on the position of dominant peaks.
 Fig. 4  (a) Raman spectra of CTS samples sulfurized at different temperatures. Correlation between annealing temperature and the ratio of area II/area I (b) as well as with the distance between the two main Raman peaks (c). 
Area ratio based method
This method has been described in detail elsewhere25,37–40 where it was successfully used for studying different properties of chalcogenide and other compounds. Basically it relies on calculating the area of two specific spectral regions and then monitoring the ratio of these areas. Although this technique can introduce additional noise due to the requirement of a systematic and well performed baseline subtraction, it remains a powerful and precise tool for assessing small variations in Raman spectra. In our case we focused on the two most intense Raman peaks with “area I” corresponding to the 240–333 cm−1 spectral region and “area II” to 337–365 cm−1. As previously mentioned a change of CTS phase from a mix of cubic and monoclinic phases to pure monoclinic results in a reduction of area I values as the cubic phase contribution decreases in this region while area II is less affected. Then by calculating the area II/area I ratio, an assessment of this phase transition is possible with high ratio values obtained for a purer monoclinic phase and low values for higher cubic phase content. This ratio is plotted as a function of annealing temperature in Fig. 4(b). There is an obvious correlation between the temperature used during the annealing and the CTS phase synthesized: the higher the temperature, the more dominant the monoclinic phase is.
Raman shift position based method
Another method tested to draw trends between Raman features and absorber properties consists of calculating the peak position of the two most intense modes and then checking how the distance between them varies. When the distance between the two Raman modes increases, it results mainly from a modification of peak position for the Raman mode located at 295 cm−1. In fact, position of the Raman mode at around 355 cm−1 varies little between cubic and monoclinic CTS phases and can be considered fixed. As the 295 cm−1 Raman peak shifts to lower frequencies for purer monoclinic CTS; by monitoring the distance between these two peaks, phase transition assessment is achieved with a purer monoclinic CTS phase for higher distances. Unlike the first method, this one is not dependent on equipment calibration, and/or complex data treatment. Peak position is quickly and easily obtained though high resolution spectra are required to minimize errors. A plot between this feature and sulfurization temperature is presented in Fig. 4(c). Both methods proposed for the assessment of the cubic/monoclinic phase ratio are not quantitative but only correlate Raman features with an indirect indicator of the phase ratio: the annealing temperature. A full quantification of the phase concentration for each sample would require a more detailed analysis which was out of scope of this work. However once this additional step is performed, these methodologies could become fully quantitative.
CTS-based devices: impact of the cubic phase on optoelectronic properties
According to the literature, the highest efficiency achieved by CTS-based solar cells was obtained with an absorber layer made of a pure monoclinic CTS polymorph,31 whereas devices based on cubic CTS absorbers have always depicted lower performances.3 This difference is well known and explained by the CTS community by the adequate band gap for photovoltaic application of the monoclinic phase (0.92–1.0 eV) as well as its higher crystalline quality.19 However to our knowledge, no systematic study was performed about the degradation of optoelectronic properties by the presence of a cubic phase. To do so, cubic phase content in a CTS absorber has been correlated with device performances using cubic/monoclinic phase ratios obtained by the two Raman methods previously presented. The resulting trends are shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  Correlation of area based (left) and peak distance based (right) methods with optoelectronic parameters. The green star corresponds to the optoelectronic properties of the best sample achieved in this work after having performed a post process annealing on a hot plate. 
Firstly, it is worth mentioning that temperature variations can induce structural modifications of phases, the most significant being a better crystalline quality for higher temperatures. However in our case, the correlations between temperature and optoelectronic properties depicted less linear behaviors suggesting that the effect of temperature is minor. Thereby in the following discussion we admit that variation of optoelectronic parameters is mainly due to the phase transition from a mix of cubic/monoclinic CTS to a pure monoclinic CTS absorber. Fig. 5 depicts clear trends between a higher content of the cubic phase and the reduction of both Jsc and Voc, whereas the fill factor (FF) stays unchanged. Hence device efficiency is indeed reduced for higher cubic CTS content which agrees with the literature.
The observed decrease of voltage can be first explained by a variation of the bandgap; however the values extracted from EQE measurements (Fig. 6(b)) did not follow this trend: for each sample two clear bandgaps were obtained by calculating the derivative of EQE curves, one at around 0.95 eV and a second between 1.04–1.08 eV. The latter seems to decrease from 1.08 to 1.04 eV as the monoclinic phase becomes purer but we believe that this variation is not enough for explaining a gain of almost 200 mV. Another more plausible reason could be that this phase transition leads to a less defective material. In fact cubic CTS has been reported to be a disordered phase41 while photoluminescence measurements have proven that the monoclinic phase is the least defective of the two polymorphs.31 In our case, it was also confirmed by XRD where the monoclinic phase diffractogram depicted peaks characteristics of a high crystalline quality material.

JV (a) and EQE (b) curves of CTS devices made of absorbers sulfurized at different temperatures. EQE derivatives (d(EQE)/d(E)) are also shown. 
On the other hand, various reasons could induce a decrease of Jsc but we believe that one of the main causes may be a reduction of carriers' diffusion length by the presence of two different structures, one of them with a bad crystalline quality. Another interesting point resides in the fact that FF remains unaffected by the phase transition as well as shunt and series resistances which are constant for all the devices regardless of the phase. It has been reported that in both “ordered” monoclinic and “disordered” cubic CTS compounds, carrier lifetimes are similar and in the order of a few picoseconds.42 Then we assume that high recombination rates in the space charge region together with short carrier lifetimes in our monoclinic CTS layers still prevent any FF changes.
After the completion of CTS solar cells, a low temperature annealing under air atmosphere (PA) using a hot plate was tested in order to further improve cell efficiency (green star in Fig. 5). This process has proved to be beneficial for CTZSe-based solar cells with sometimes a huge increase in efficiency mostly attributed to a depletion of copper at the absorber surface thus improving the CZTSe/CdS junction properties.43,44 De Wild et al. have reported a similar improvement, after air annealing at 200 °C for one hour, of the depletion width and effective diffusion length of CTS devices.45 They attributed the latter to oxygen diffusion into the absorber layer which passivates grain boundaries whereas copper inclusions into CdS and ZnO layers change their doping and thus the depletion width. In our case, interestingly Voc remains the same after this process rejecting passivation effects by oxygen incorporation. Hence the change in depletion width by copper/cadmium interdiffusion at the pn junction might be the main cause. Simultaneously the fill factor is strongly enhanced with a 25% increase resulting in a record efficiency of 2.4% for this work (see Fig. 6(c)). Jsc also depicts a small improvement, which may be explained by a better interface between the layers and thus better series resistance and FF.
It is worth noting that the highest efficiency (2.4%) was obtained from a sample annealed at 575 °C which was composed of c-CTS at 70% (according to XRD profile refinement). As c-CTS is detrimental in terms of photovoltaic efficiency, we assume that higher performances could be achieved by synthesizing a pure m-CTS absorber in our process. From a more general point of view we hypothesize that regarding CTS technology as a whole, “pure” m-CTS absorber layers might have been wrongly reported in the literature as it is quite difficult to differentiate m-CTS from c-CTS with standard characterization techniques. As a result, the presence of c-CTS in high efficiency CTS based devices could be the main reason for their limited performances.
Conclusions
Cu2SnS3 absorbers and solar cells were successfully prepared by a two-step method consisting of the sulfurization of metallic stacks. Sulfurization at 500 °C leads to layers composed of both cubic and monoclinic CTS polymorphs but by increasing the temperature a purer monoclinic phase can be obtained. Remarkably, with only 30% of the CTS layer composed of pure m-CTS, an efficiency of 2.4% was obtained during this study. Additionally a systematic study by XRD and Raman spectroscopy of cubic and monoclinic CTS phases has been presented. The results show that cubic-CTS and monoclinic-CTS phases are best assessed by XRD and Raman spectroscopy respectively. It suggests that both techniques might be necessary for the complete assessment of CTS polymorphism. In this context, two Raman based methodologies are proposed for the assessment of cubic/monoclinic phase ratios. The first one based on the evaluation of peak positions and the second based on their relative area. Each one has its own pros and cons, the area method being precise but requiring complicated data processing whereas the difference of peak positions is simpler but high resolution spectra are needed. The obtained correlations confirm that CTS polymorph formation can be controlled by choosing an adequate sulfurization temperature. Both methods lead to the same trends demonstrating the reliability of both the methods and the results. Moreover correlations between the predominant CTS phase and the optoelectronic properties of CTS-based cells have also been found: a lower Voc, Jsc and hence efficiency are obtained for low sulfurization temperature and thus for a higher cubic phase content, while the fill factor seems unaffected by the predominant phase. Interestingly, by performing a low temperature annealing on complete CTS cells, efficiency is improved by enhancing mainly their fill factor. From a more general point of view we hypothesize that regarding CTS technology as a whole, “pure” m-CTS absorber layers might have been wrongly reported in the literature and that the presence of c-CTS in high efficiency CTS based devices could be the main reason for their limited performances.
