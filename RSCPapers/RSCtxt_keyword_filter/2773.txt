    , Accepted 26th November 2015First published on 30th November 2015AbstractDue to their low cost, environmental friendliness and efficiency, aqueous-processed polymer/nanocrystal hybrid solar cells (HSCs) have attracted much attention in recent years. To promote the development of aqueous-processed HSCs, the design and synthesis of new water soluble conjugated polymers (WSCPs) are required. In this work, aqueous-processed MEH-PPV/CdTe HSCs are firstly fabricated. A PCE of 4.20% is achieved, which is comparable to the oil-processed MEH-PPV/NC HSCs. The water-soluble MEH-PPV precursor could increase the miscibility between polymers and aqueous CdTe NCs, and decrease their phase size. Furthermore, by adjusting MEH-PPV/CdTe ratio and annealing temperature, the nanoscale morphology of MEH-PPV/CdTe HSCs will change, which impacts charge transfer and transport. These results provide an important approach for efficient aqueous-processed MEH-PPV/NC HSCs.
Introduction
Polymer/nanocrystal hybrid solar cells (HSCs) have attracted much attention due to the low cost of conjugated polymers and the high charge carrier mobility of inorganic nanocrystals (NCs).1–12 Additionally, NCs exhibit an advantage of adjustable photoelectronic properties because of their tunable size.13 In the last decade, a variety of NCs and conjugated polymers have been investigated for fabricating polymer/NC HSCs.14–18 However, these inorganic NCs and polymers are usually synthesized and dissolved in organic solvents, such as chlorobenzene, toluene and chloroform, which are toxic and flammable. As an alternative, aqueous-processed HSCs provide an environmentally friendly approach for efficient photovoltaic devices.19–23 Water soluble conjugated polymers (WSCPs) can be applied to fabricate the photovoltaic devices by spin-coating, printing or ink-jet, which are convenient methods for industrial production.24,25 In addition, the solubility of WSCPs in highly polar solvents is desirable for constructing multilayer photovoltaic devices in combination with neutral polymers.
The WSCPs are composed of π-conjugated backbones and charged side groups.26 However, most of their charged groups cannot eliminate after fabricating the HSCs, which would obstruct the carrier transport.27,28 An effective solution is to synthesize WSCP precursors, in which charged groups (such as tetrahydrothiophene) would be eliminated after annealing. The HSCs manufactured in this approach have excellent device performance.29–33 To promote the development of aqueous-processed HSCs, the design and synthesis of WSCPs are required.
As a semiconducting conjugated polymer, poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV) is widely used in HSCs.34–37 Greenham et al. firstly demonstrated polymer/NC HSCs in 1996, in which the donor was MEH-PPV.38 Because the small phase size of CdSe nanodots led to poor charge transport, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was low. After that, many kinds of MEH-PPV/NC HSCs were fabricated. Cao et al. overcame the phase separation problem by choosing pyridine as the solvent, and achieved the highest record for MEH-PPV/CdS devices with PCE of 1.17% in 2007.39 However, the polymer was not able to fully penetrate NCs. Using water soluble polymer precursors, NCs can significantly control the nanoscale morphology.14 Until now, aqueous-processed MEH-PPV/NC HSCs have not been fabricated. Therefore, we focus on aqueous-processed MEH-PPV/CdTe HSCs.
In this paper, the water-soluble MEH-PPV precursor is synthesized through the Wessling polymerization process and applied to aqueous inverted HSCs. The precursor can increase the miscibility between polymers and aqueous CdTe NCs, and decrease their phase size.14,31 After annealing, an interpenetrating network structure is constructed. And the positive side-chain groups of the precursor can be easily eliminated. This approach could effectively prevent the charges of the polymer acting as traps. The intimacy also enhanced exciton dissociation and charge transfer. Thus, we can presume that the water-soluble MEH-PPV precursor has excellent photovoltaic performance. A PCE of 4.20% is achieved under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination. The nanoscale morphology of MEH-PPV/CdTe HSCs which impacts charge transfer and transport is deeply investigated in this article. These results provide an important approach for efficient solution-processed MEH-PPV/NC HSCs. We believe that our research can be beneficial to the future studies towards highly efficient aqueous-processed HSCs.
Experimental
Materials
Tellurium powder (200 mesh, 99.8%) was purchased from Aldrich. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4, 99%) and cadmium chloride hemi(pentahydrate) (CdCl2·2.5H2O, 99%) were purchased from the Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. 2-Mercaptoethylamine (MA, 98%) was obtained from Acros. 2,5-Bis(chloromethyl)-4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)anisole and tetrahydrothiophene (98%) were obtained from Alfa Aesar. All materials were used as received.
Preparation of the MEH-PPV precursor
The MEH-PPV precursor was prepared according to the previous report.40 1 g 2,5-bis(chloromethyl)-4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)anisole was reacted with 2 mL tetrahydrothiophene (molar ratio about 1:4) in 20 mL CH3OH at 50 °C for 20 h. The product was purified by concentrating the reaction solution and then precipitating the condensed solution on cold acetone. The obtained product was then dissolved in methanol (0.2 mol L−1) with an equal amount of NaOH added dropwise at 0 °C under N2. After that, the polymerization process was maintained for 1 h. The aqueous solution of the polymer precursors was then dialyzed in a refrigerator for one day.
Preparation of CdTe NCs
In a typical synthesis, 0.28 mL NaHTe (2/3 mol L−1) solution was injected into 12.5 mmol L−1 N2-saturated CdCl2 solution in the presence of MA in the pH range of 5.70–5.74. The molar ratio of Cd:MA:Te was set as 1:2.4:0.2. The resultant precursor solution was refluxed for 55 min to maintain the growth of CdTe NCs. After that, the NC solution was concentrated to 8 mL and then centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 5 min after adding isopropanol to remove ligands and superfluous salts. Subsequently, the NCs were dried in a vacuum oven and then dissolved in deionized water to obtain a 120 mg mL−1 solution.
Device fabrication
The ITO was cleaned using chloroform, acetone, isopropanol and ethanol before drying in a N2 flow. Next, the ITO substrate was immediately coated with the TiO2 precursor at a speed of 2000 rpm for 10 s. Afterwards, the samples were annealed for 20 min at 500 °C in order to convert the TiO2 precursor into anatase-phase TiO2. The active layer was fabricated by spin-coating the mixed solution or CdTe NC solution at a speed of 700 rpm for 1 min. The first layer was annealed for 2 min at 300 °C in a glovebox before spin coating the second layer which was annealed for 60 min at 300 °C in the glovebox. Finally, a 5 nm MoO3 film and a 60 nm gold electrode were evaporated through a mask at a pressure below 10−5 Torr, leading to an active area of 0.05 cm2.
Characterization
Thermal gravity analysis (TGA) was studied with a Q500 thermal gravimetric analyzer (American TA Company). UV-visible absorption spectra were obtained using a Shimadzu 3600 UV-visible-NIR spectrophotometer. Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed with a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC spectrophotometer. FT-IR spectra were taken on a Nicolet AVATAR 360 FT-IR spectrophotometer. The energy band value was measured in an integrated ultrahigh vacuum system equipped with a multitechnique surface analysis system (VG ESCALAB MK II spectrometer) and an ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer (UPS). UPS was measured with the He(I) (21.2 eV) line using a negative bias voltage applied to the samples in order to shift the spectra from the spectrometer threshold. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) micrographs were recorded in tapping mode with a Nanoscope IIIa scanning probe microscope from Digital Instruments. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was conducted using a Hitachi H-800 electron microscope at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV with a CCD camera. Current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter measurement system under 100 mW cm−2 illumination with an AM 1.5G filter. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was recorded under illumination of monochromatic light from a halogen tungsten lamp using a monochromator (Newport IQE 200) and detected by using a computer-controlled lock-in amplifier. The TA setup consisted of 400 nm pump pulses doubled from 800 nm laser pulses (∼100 fs duration, 250 Hz repetition rate) generated from a mode-locked Ti: sapphire laser/amplifier system (Solstice, Spectra-Physics) and broadband white-light probe pulses generated from 2 mm-thick water. The relative polarization of the pump and the probe beams was set to the magic angle. The TA data were collected by using a fiber coupled spectrometer connected to a computer. The EIS measurements were conducted from a CHI 660E electrochemical workstation under dark conditions at zero bias voltage with frequencies ranging from 1 Hz to 100 kHz. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE 500 MHz spectrometer with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. Mass spectra were recorded on a GC/MS mass spectrometer.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of MEH-PPV
The MEH-PPV precursor was synthesized by 2,5-bis(chloromethyl)-4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)anisole with tetrahydrothiophene (THT) followed by the Wessling reaction.40 The synthetic route is shown in Fig. 1. Sulfonium salt was separated as a white solid. Its structure was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Fig. S1†) and mass spectrometry (Fig. S2†). The MEH-PPV precursor was confirmed by NMR (Fig. S3†).

For converting the MEH-PPV precursor to MEH-PPV, annealing the polymer film is an effective approach. So, thermal stability is an important factor to be characterized. The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) results of the MEH-PPV precursor shown in Fig. 2a illustrate that the chloride ions are removed as hydrogen chloride at temperature higher than 125 °C. Above 220 °C, the THT units begin to be eliminated to form MEH-PPV.41 The polymer begins to decompose when the temperature is close to 400 °C, and the presence of O2 also accelerates the decomposition rate. Therefore, we perform the annealing process under vacuum at a temperature between 220 and 440 °C to prevent thermal degradation and decomposition.

(f) Transient absorption spectrum of the MEH-PPV film on the quartz substrate excited with the light of 400 nm. 
To prove the formation of the conjugated structure, the Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy measurement is conducted (Fig. 2b). Before annealing the MEH-PPV precursor, the characteristic absorption peaks of CC stretching vibration (1679 cm−1) and vinylene C–H stretching vibration (3047 cm−1) are weak, which means that only a little THT is removed. For 60 min at 315 °C, these characteristic absorption peaks are observably enhanced. The normalized X-ray diffraction (XRD) data shown in Fig. 2c have (110) and (210) peaks, which are consistent with literature values from other groups.42,43 Before annealing, only the (110) peak can be observed. After annealing, THT is eliminated and carbon–carbon double bonds are constructed. Attributing to the higher crystallinity degree and π–π stacking, the (110) peak and (210) peak are strengthened. The UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence peaks of MEH-PPV are 450 nm and 560 nm, respectively (Fig. 2d). These results demonstrate the formation of partially ordered conjugated structure and intermolecular π–π interactions.

Fig. 2e represents the atomic force microscopy (AFM) of the MEH-PPV. The corresponding root-mean-square (RMS) roughness is calculated to be 1.568 nm by spin-coating on quartz. The flat surface originates from the polymer nature.
We utilized a femtosecond transient absorption technique (TA) to investigate the photoelectric properties of the MEH-PPV film. Fig. 2f shows the time-resolved transient absorption spectra recorded at different time intervals after laser excitation at 400 nm. The band from 400 to 620 nm represents the ground state bleaching. And that from 620 to 800 nm is the excited state absorption.44 Employing ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. S4†) and absorption onset, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level are confirmed as −5.22 eV and −3.01 eV, respectively. Such high LUMO energy levels are expected to provide enough driving force for efficient exciton dissociation. Besides, the HOMO energy levels are higher than the valence band of CdTe NCs, which ensures the hole transfer from CdTe NCs to the polymers.
The hole mobility of MEH-PPV is measured by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method (Fig. S5a†). The devices with configuration of ITO/MEH-PPV/MoO3/Au were fabricated. The carrier mobility is calculated according to eqn (1) J = 9ε0εrμ(V − Vbi − Vr)2/8L3(1)where ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the dielectric constant of MEH-PPV (assumed as 3), μ is the hole mobility, V is the applied voltage, Vr is the voltage drop due to the contact resistance and series resistance across the electrodes, Vbi is the built-in voltage, and L is the film thickness. By the SCLC method, the hole mobility of MEH-PPV is measured as 3.29 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. Compared with the PPV derivatives and poly(2,5-thienylene vinylene) (PTV) derivatives we synthesized before,29,30,33 this hole mobility is low (Fig. S5a–c†). PPV and MPPV show higher hole mobility because of stronger intermolecular π–π interactions, which is confirmed by the XRD data (Fig. S6†). After annealing at 315 °C, the XRD peak of PPV is strong and sharp while the MEH-PPV peak is weak. Long alkoxy side chains of MEH-PPV decreases the planarity and π–π stacking interactions, which lowers the hole mobility. For PTV derivatives, the lone pair electrons of sulphur atoms make the electron density of PTV chains higher than PPV derivatives, which lead to higher hole mobility.33
Aqueous-processed hybrid solar cells
Hybrid solar cells are fabricated by using our previously reported architecture of ITO/TiO2/CdTe/MEH-PPV:CdTe/MoO3/Au (Fig. 3).29 TiO2 and MoO3 are selected as the electron transport layer and hole transport layer, respectively. A layer of pure CdTe quantum dots (QDs) is cast at the bottom of the polymer:NC blended film, which can absorb most part of the light. Fig. 4a shows the absorption of active layers with different ratios. The absorption increases with the addition of CdTe contents in the hybrid films.

The device performance of the n–i structure is greatly influenced by the MEH-PPV:CdTe weight ratio. Different weight ratios of MEH-PPV:CdTe are studied, including 1:6, 1:12 and 1:18 (Table 1). The current density–voltage curves (J–V curves, under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2) of the optimized HSCs for each ratio are shown in Fig. 4b, with the detailed photovoltaic parameters listed in Table 1. The best device with the n–i structure shows the PCE of 4.20%, short current density (Jsc) of 13.56 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.599 V and fill factor (FF) of 0.517. And when the weight ratio is 1:6, the lower Jsc results in a poor device properties. When the ratio is 1:18, although the Jsc is 14.48 mA cm−2 due to a large content of CdTe, the Voc, FF and PCE are decreased. Different weight ratio active layers have different morphologies, which will be discussed in detail in the following paragraphs. The corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve (Fig. 4c) matches well with the increase of Jsc. Since light with a short wavelength is mainly absorbed by the active layer close to the cathode due to the high absorption coefficient, photogenerated holes need to travel long distance before reaching the anode.

The electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) is utilized to analyze charge dynamics. The EIS measurements were conducted under dark conditions with a frequency ranging from 1 Hz to 100 kHz (Fig. 5a). In the measurements, mainly one semicircle was observed on the Nyquist plot for each cell under zero voltage. In high frequency ranges (100–10 kHz) (Fig. 5b), the series resistance (Rs) of the 1:6 ratio cell is the highest and the Rs of the 1:18 ratio cell is the lowest. It implies that with the increase of CdTe proportion in the active layer, the charge transport resistance decreases and mobility is enhanced. So the short current density is improved. In low frequency ranges (10 kHz to 1 Hz), the shunt resistance (Rsh) of the 1:12 ratio cell is the highest one. This implies that the probability of charge recombination is reduced in this optimal device, which is consistent with the improvement of the FF and PCE.

Morphology
The morphology of MEH-PPV:CdTe films is an important factor affecting device performance. In order to probe the microscopic change induced by the polymer content, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is employed to study the active layer (Fig. 6a, c and e). When the MEH-PPV:CdTe weight ratio is 1:6 (50 vol%), CdTe NCs are wrapped by polymers. The nanoparticle phase dimension is too small to form the continuous phase. It causes an inferior effect on the electron transport. When the weight ratio is 1:12 (33 vol%), MEH-PPV percolates through the voids of CdTe NCs, resulting in the optimal photovoltaic performance. CdTe NCs and polymer domains are formed as an interpenetrating network structure. This type of bicontinuous percolation network prolongs carrier lifetime. Furthermore, a larger donor/acceptor interface improves the exciton dissociation efficiency. As the CdTe loading is 1:18 (25 vol%), the excessive CdTe NCs in the blended film result in agglomeration. MEH-PPV cannot percolate efficiently in the gap of CdTe-rich domains. Thus, the aggregation of polymers will occur, causing a long distance for hole transport and resulting in a lower PCE. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) affords information about the surface topographies of MEH-PPV:CdTe blended films (Fig. 6b, d and f). By spin-coating and annealing approaches, the minimum root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of blended films with a 1:12 weight ratio is calculated. The results of TEM images and AFM images correspond to each other, which indicate that 1:12 is the optimized ratio of MEH-PPV:CdTe.
 Fig. 6  TEM images and AFM images (500 nm × 500 nm) of MEH-PPV:CdTe blend films with different weight ratios (a) and (b) 1:6; (c) and (d) 1:12; (e) and (f) 1:18. The root-mean-square roughness of blended films is (b) 5.037 nm, (d) 2.488 nm and (f) 4.431 nm. 
The annealing temperature is a crucial factor for the thermal stability of polymer and the growth of NCs, which would further impact the charge transfer and transport. We chose 1:12 weight ratio photovoltaic devices for variable temperature experiments. Fig. 7a shows the corresponding photocurrent–voltage curves. We have observed that the devices exhibit poorer performance at 250 °C or 375 °C as compared to at 315 °C. In particular, a sharp drop in the performance level of the fill factor is observed. Further studies with TEM images show substantial distinction of three different annealing temperature active layers (Fig. 7b–d). For 250 °C annealing, CdTe grains are relatively small and dispersed in the polymer. In discontinuous CdTe NCs, charges need to be transported multiple times in order to be extracted by TiO2. When the annealing temperature is 315 °C, CdTe NCs combined closely. Meanwhile, MEH-PPV percolates efficiently in the gap of CdTe-rich domains. This kind of interpenetrating network structure makes it possible for the high-efficiency charge carrier to transport. At 375 °C, CdTe NCs grow larger. Meanwhile, as the temperature is too high, polymers decompose to decrease the carrier mobility and leave larger gaps (the decomposition of MEH-PPV was measured by TGA in Fig. S7†). Therefore, the CdTe phase size is increased. Obvious phase separation leads to leakage current, detrimental recombination and low fill factor. Through experimenting with temperatures, it can be shown that HSCs exhibit the best performance at 315 °C.

Compared with oil-phase processed MEH-PPV/NC HSCs, aqueous-processed HSCs successfully overcome the following problem. Oil-phase processed HSCs usually involve mixed organic solvents, which leads to gross phase segregation.39 In contrast, the aqueous process with a single solvent is beneficial for achieving appropriate phase segregation, thus increasing the exciton dissociation and charge transport efficiency.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we designed and synthesized specifically the water-soluble MEH-PPV precursors and proved that the conjugated polymer can be produced after annealing. An optimized PCE of 4.20% was achieved. We investigated charge dynamics via electrochemical impedance spectra. Furthermore, the ratio of polymer:NCs and annealing temperature can effectively influence the blended film morphology, which is related to the device performance. These results provide an important approach for efficient solution-processed MEH-PPV/NC HSCs. We believe that our research can be beneficial to future molecular designs of highly efficient polymer–CdTe aqueous HSCs.
