    , Accepted 10th January 2021First published on 1st February 2021AbstractCu-doped Ag2BiI5 (Cu:SBI) powders with 0–10 mol% doping concentrations were synthesized by a solid-state method in an evacuated glass tube. While Cu doping did not appreciably modify the crystallographic structure or the bandgap of Ag2BiI5 (SBI), it significantly increased light absorption in the wavelength range of 400–700 nm. They were applied as light absorbers of n–i–p type solar cells employing mesoporous TiO2 as an electron transporting layer and PTAA as a hole transporting layer, and it was found that Cu doping leads to a notable increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE). Particularly, solar cell devices with 2.5 mol% Cu-doped SBI (SC-Cu2.5:SBI) exhibited a PCE of 2.53% with a VOC of 619 mV, JSC of 7.13 mA cm−2 and FF of 57.25%, which was increased by 25% compared with that of a bare SBI device (PCE = 2.04%). The PCE increase was mainly due to the significant increase in JSC, suggesting that the enhancement is caused by the increase in light absorption. The effect of Cu dopants on the light absorption properties was investigated by first-principles calculations of energy band structures, and charge transport and recombination behaviors of Cu2.5:SBI were analyzed by transient absorption spectroscopy. Under high humidity conditions, SBI shows much better long-term stability than Pb-perovskites such as methylamine lead iodide, while SC-Cu2.5:SBI shows comparable stability to the bare SBI-based device, implying that Cu doping does not influence the stability of SBI.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) employing alkylammonium lead halide as a light-absorber material have attracted extensive attention due to their remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 25% with very low fabrication cost.1–3 However, Pb contained in perovskite light absorbers is a toxic element that requires to be replaced by environmentally benign elements. Moreover, Pb-containing halide perovskites are not sufficiently stable because dissociation energies of the bonds between monovalent large cations and halide anions are low and they are vulnerable to moisture due to their significant ionic character. Therefore, for the commercialization of PSC devices, it is essential to develop Pb-free light-absorbers without containing toxic elements and with long-term stability.
Among Pb-free light absorbers, the most commonly studied material would be A3B2X9 (A = alkali metal or alkylammonium, B = Bi or Sb, X = halogen).4–12 They are a kind of vacancy-ordered layered triple perovskite structure in which a third of B-site atoms occupying the octahedral sites are vacant. There are two types of crystallographic phases in terms of the vacancy ordering in the B-sites, that is, the layer phase consisting of corner-sharing octahedra and the dimer phase with face-sharing octahedra. The layer phase with a relatively smaller band gap offers higher PCE than the dimer phase,11–13 and over 3% PCE has been reported recently.14–16
Double perovskites belonging to A2BIBIIIX6 and A2BIVX6 structures are also examined as Pb-free light absorbers.17–23 In the A2BIBIIIX6 structures, monovalent BI and trivalent BIII cations alternatively occupy the octahedral sites of the double perovskite structure. For example, Cs2AgBiI6, Cs2AgInCl6, Cs2AgBiBr6, and Cs2NaBiBr6 have been investigated as light-absorbers for perovskite-like solar cells,17–21 and among them Cs2AgBiBr6 with a band gap of 2.05 eV has been reported to show PCE over 2%.14,22,23 For the A2BIVX6 structures, in which the tetravalent BIV cations occupy half of the B-sites and the other half are vacant, Cs2Snl6, Cs2TiX6 (X = Br, I), and Cs2Zrl6 have been studied as a light absorber.24–26 A PCE of 3.28% has been reported from Cs2TiBr6, but its highly hygroscopic properties prevent fabrication of films by a solution process.26
Silver bismuth iodides consisting of environmentally benign elements have increasingly drawn attention as a potential Pb-free light-absorber due to their outstanding stability against humidity and high light-absorption coefficient.27,28 Various crystallographic phases such as AgBi2I7, AgBiI4, Ag2BiI5, and Ag3BiI6 are known to belong to the silver bismuth iodide family, but their physical properties are not significantly different from each other regardless of their crystallographic phases. For example, the bandgaps of all silver bismuth iodide materials are in the range of 1.8–1.9 eV, while their light absorption coefficients and grain structures of the coated films are similar to each other.27–33 However, the photovoltaic (PV) performances of silver bismuth iodide materials thus far reported are quite diverse. While the silver bismuth iodide phases with a higher Ag to Bi ratio seem to exhibit relatively higher PV performances, it is premature to draw such a conclusion at an early stage of their development.27,30,34–37
Ever since AgBi2I7 in the cubic phase was employed as a light absorber of perovskite-like solar cells with a reported PCE of 1.22% in 2016,29 various silver bismuth iodide phases of diverse Ag to Bi ratios have been developed.27,35–40 It was reported that Ag3BiI6 which has the highest Ag to Bi ratio in the silver bismuth iodide family exhibited a PCE of 4.3%, which is noticeably higher than that obtained from the materials of other compositions. However, it is not easy to reproduce their results by a solution process, presumably due to the difficulty of forming the Ag3BiI6 phase belonging to the R3m rudorffite phase at a low temperature.27 AgBiI4 in the cubic phase has also been investigated as a light absorber. According to theoretical calculations, AgBiI4 was reported to be a stable phase,38 and a PCE of 2.1% or even higher value were achieved experimentally.36,39
Previously, we prepared Ag2BiI5 in the hexagonal phase by a solid-state method at elevated temperatures and found that it is one of the most stable phases among the silver bismuth iodide families.40 For example, when the AgI to BiI3 ratios of the reactants was varied from 2:1 to 1:1, the hexagonal Ag2BiI5 phase was readily formed together with the BiI3 impurity phase.
Doping with other elements is expected to modify the PV properties of silver bismuth iodides, but only a few attempts have been made thus far.41–43 For example, it was reported that doping Br or S into the iodide site could significantly enhance PV properties.42 Recently, Sb was also doped into the Bi-site of AgBi2I7. Sb doping led to a blue-shift of the absorption edge, but its PV properties were enhanced significantly due to the improvement in electron injection to the TiO2 layer.43
In the present study, we developed solar cells employing Cu-doped Ag2BiI5 by doping Cu into the Ag-site of the hexagonal Ag2BiI5, which is a reproducibly obtained phase and provides comparatively high PV properties. It is considered that Cu+ with high softness is one of the most suitable cations for the replacement of Ag+.44 By preparing and characterizing Cu-doped Ag2BiI5 of various Cu concentrations, we systematically investigated the role of the Cu dopant in enhancing PV properties with the aid of theoretical energy band calculations and spectroscopic analysis.
Results and discussion
Bare Ag2BiI5 (SBI) and Cu-doped Ag2BiI5 (Ag2(1−x)Cu2xBiI5, Cu:SBI) of various Cu-doping concentrations were synthesized by a solid-state method in an evacuated glass tube. The mole fractions of Cu were varied to 0, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 5 and 10 mol% to obtain bare Ag2BiI5, Ag1.97Cu0.03BiI5 (Cu1.5:SBI), Ag1.95Cu0.05BiI5 (Cu2.5:SBI), Ag1.93Cu0.07BiI5 (Cu3.5:SBI), Ag1.90Cu0.10BiI5 (Cu5:SBI), and Ag1.80Cu0.20BiI5 (Cu10:SBI), respectively. At a synthetic temperature of 480 °C, the BiI3 powders with a melting point (mp) of 409 °C were melted and they served as the solvent to dissolve the AgI with a mp of 558 °C and the CuI with a mp of 606 °C. Therefore, the synthetic method in this work can be regarded as a flux method, which allows the reactants to be thoroughly mixed at a molecular level. In this regard, the added Cu+ is expected to facilely replace the Ag+ occupying the octahedral site of the hexagonal Ag2BiI5 structure.
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of polycrystalline SBI and various Cu:SBI powders as-synthesized by the solid-state method are shown in Fig. 1a. With respect to the particle size and morphology, the Cu-doped SBI powders are quite similar to the bare SBI, regardless of the Cu doping levels. Fig. 1b shows the XRD patterns for the as-prepared Cu-doped SBI powders of various compositions. The XRD patterns were not changed up to 10 mol% of Cu doping without any appreciable impurity phases within the detection limit. Slow scan XRD patterns for the various Cu-doped SBI samples were obtained in the range of 12.55–13.55° to monitor the shift of the (003) diffraction peak, which is a main peak of the hexagonal Ag2BiI5 phase (JCPDS file #35-1025), as shown in Fig. 1c. As the Cu mol% increases, the position of the (003) peak gradually shifted to higher angles. Considering that the typical radius of Ag+ is 129 pm and that of Cu+ is 91 pm, the Cu+doping will reduce the cell parameters. The d003 values of Ag2(1−x)Cu2xBiI5 samples as a function of Cu doping concentration were plotted, as shown in the inset in Fig. 1c. As the Cu doping level increases, the d003 value decreases linearly, suggesting that the added Cu was quantitatively doped into the Ag site of Ag2BiI5.

XPS analysis was carried out to analyze the oxidation state of elements present in the bare SBI and Cu5:SBI powders. From the Ag 3d (Fig. 2a) and Bi 4f (Fig. 2b) XPS spectra, it was found that the positions and shapes of their peaks were not appreciably varied by Cu doping, indicating that the oxidation states of Ag and Bi remained +1 and +3, respectively. Noticeably, a small number of metallic Bi peaks (4f5/2 at ∼162.7 eV and 4f7/2 at ∼157.3 eV) was additionally found in the pure SBI and Cu2.5:SBI powders, as observed by T. Li et al.,45 but the concentration of the metallic Bi component was not appreciably changed by Cu doping. The oxidation state of Cu in Cu2.5:SBI was analyzed by monitoring the Cu 2p spectra, as shown in Fig. 2c. The Cu 2p3/2 peak was partially overlapped with that of I 3p1/2 at 930.1 eV. By deconvolution, the peak positions of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 were determined to be 932.4 eV and 952.3 eV, respectively, which are the typical peak positions of Cu+.46 If Cu2+ is included, Cu2+ 2p satellite peaks have to be additionally observed in the range of 940–947 eV.46 However, no peak was observed in this region, indicating the oxidation state of Cu in Cu2.5:SBI to be +1 only. The XPS spectrum of Cu5:SBI in Fig. S1† also reveals the same result.

For the preparation of SBI and various Cu:SBI films, the as-prepared powders were dissolved in the mixed solvent of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethylformamide (DMF) to form 0.35 M solution, and spin-coated over an FTO/TiO2 substrate. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, approximately half of the TiO2 surface was covered by SBI or Cu2.5:SBI. Hence, major portions of SBI or Cu2.5:SBI were infiltrated into the mesopores of the TiO2 layer, while some of them were deposited over the surface of the TiO2 layer. In addition, the Cu doping did not induce any significant change in the morphology of the SBI films. The cross-sectional view SEM images in Fig. 3c and d indicate that the thicknesses of the SBI and Cu2.5:SBI layers, partially covering the TiO2 surfaces, are about 40 nm. Fig. S2† shows the SEM images of the bare SBI and Cu2.5:SBI films coated from the solutions of various concentrations in the range of 0.25–0.55 M. The morphology and size and shape of the grains of these two films derived from the solutions of the same concentration were very close each other.

We obtained a depth profile for the atomic composition of a Cu2.5:SBI film coated on a mesoporous TiO2 layer. As shown in Fig. S3,† the relative atomic ratios of Cu, Ag, and Bi were not appreciably changed along the film depth, suggesting that the elemental composition of the fabricated Cu2.5:SBI film is highly uniform.
We monitored the absorption spectra of SBI and various Cu-SBI films coated on the FTO/TiO2 substrate, as shown in Fig. 4a. It was found that the Cu:SBI films show considerably increased absorption over the whole wavelength range, compared with the bare SBI film of the same thicknesses. The absorbance of Cu:SBI reached an optimum level by 2.5–3.5 mol% Cu doping, and the additional increase of the doping concentration did not increase the absorbance furthermore. It is noteworthy that Cu-doping into SBI did not induce an appreciable shift of the absorption edge, regardless of the Cu-doping concentration. By applying the Tauc plot, the band gap (Eg) of each light-absorber film was determined, as shown in Fig. 4b. The Eg of pure SBI and Cu2.5:SBI was determined to be 1.85 eV and 1.84 eV, respectively, suggesting that Cu doping does not appreciably influence the bandgap.

The valence band maxima (VBM) of bare SBI and Cu2.5:SBI were determined by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). As shown in Fig. S4,† for the bare SBI, the cutoff energy (Ecutoff) was 16.73 eV, leading to the Fermi level (EF) of 4.49 eV from the equation, EF = 21.22 eV (He I) − Ecutoff. Consequently, the VBM level (EVB) of SBI was determined to be −5.77 eV from the EVBM − EF value of 1.28 eV. In the same manner, the EVBM of Cu2.5:SBI was determined to be −5.80 eV (Fig. 4c), revealing that the VBM level of SBI was not significantly changed by Cu+ doping. As a result, the position of the conduction band minimum (CBM) was lowered by 0.04 eV with 2.5 mol% Cu doping, according to the Eg value estimated from the Tauc plot and the VBM level determined from the UPS measurements.
The Cu-doped SBI solar cell has the structure of a typical mesoscopic n–i–p architecture, as shown in Fig. 5a and b. In the FTO/TiO2/Cu-SBI/PTAA/Ag structure, the thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 layer is ∼400 nm, and PTAA and Ag layers have thicknesses of 30 nm and 80 nm, respectively.

The photovoltaic (PV) properties of SBI and various Cu:SBI solar cell devices were analyzed. Preliminarily, we determined the optimum concentration of coating solution in preparing a 2.5 mol% Cu-doped SBI (SC-Cu2.5:SBI) film. As shown in Fig. S5,† 0.35 M turned out to be the optimum concentration, indicating that the highest PCE can be obtained at a partial coverage of the mesoporous TiO2 layer by Cu2.5:SBI. Then, we measured the PV properties of the Cu:SBI solar cell devices depending on the concentration level of Cu doping, as shown in the J–V curves of Fig. 5c, and the detailed PV parameters are listed in Table 1. It was found that PV performance was improved by small amounts of Cu doping and that the highest PCE was achieved from the solar cell devices with Cu2.5:SBI. However, a further increase of Cu-doping concentration over 2.5 mol% deteriorated the PV properties. Particularly, SC-Cu2.5:SBI shows a PCE of 2.53% with a VOC of 619 mV, JSC of 7.13 mA cm−2 and FF of 57.25%. Compared with SC-SBI with a PCE of 2.04%, VOC of 602 mV, JSC of 6.04 mA cm−2 and FF of 56.11%, the PCE obtained from SC-Cu2.5:SBI was increased by 25%. By Cu doping, the increase of JSC was considerable, but the increases of VOC and FF were small, suggesting that PCE enhancement by Cu doping is mainly due to the increase in light absorption.

As the doping concentration of Cu increases, the series resistance (Rs) of the devices remains the same whereas shunt resistance (Rsh) is gradually decreased by Cu doping (Table 1). Particularly, up to 2.5 mol% of Cu doping, shunt resistance (Rsh) was not changed appreciably but was rapidly decreased by a larger amount of Cu-doping, suggesting that Cu-doping over 2.5% induces a significant increase of the leakage current.47,48
The IPCE spectra were obtained for the solar cells fabricated with bare SBI and Cu2.5:SBI, as shown in Fig. 5d. The JSC values acquired from the integration of the IPCE spectra match the values acquired from the J–V curves in Fig. 5c. The quantum efficiency of SC-Cu2.5:SBI was increased in the entire wavelength range of 400–700 nm. Particularly, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) maxima of SC-Cu2.5:SBI were 44% at a wavelength of 550 nm, whereas those of SC-SBI were 38%. The utilization range of sunlight by SC-Cu2.5:SBI was up to 700 nm, indicating that the spectral range of light utilization by SBI was not extended by Cu doping at all, and also suggesting that the improvement in quantum efficiency is due to the increase of light absorption.
The J–V curves for forward and backward scans were acquired for SC-Cu2.5:SBI. As shown in Fig. 5e, virtually no hysteresis was observed for SC-Cu2.5:SBI. That is, the PCEs obtained by backward and forward scans were 2.53% and 2.48%, respectively, which are quite close to each other. For SC-Cu2.5:SBI, the steady-state photocurrent and power output at the maximum power point were monitored, as shown in Fig. 5f. The power output was very stable, and the achieved PCE of ∼2.49% is comparable to the average value acquired from the forward and reverse scans.
The J–V curves of Cu2.5:SBI were measured at light intensities in the range of 0.1–1 sun, as shown in Fig. S6.† The maximum PCE of 3.03% was achieved at a light intensity of 0.5 sun. The obtained result suggests that the Cu2.5:SBI layer is too thin to completely utilize the photons irradiated under 1 sun. The amount of Cu2.5:SBI deposited on the TiO2 layer has to be increased for the complete utilization of solar light. However, thicker SBI or Cu:SBI films uniformly covering the TiO2 layer show relatively poorer photovoltaic properties than the partially covered films, as seen in Fig. S5.† We believed that this is due to the characteristic low diffusion length of charge carriers for the SBI-based light absorbers.
First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to understand the increase in absorption for SBI by Cu doping. We first constructed the energetically most favorable SBI structure by using the experimentally reported Rm structure in which the Ag layer and Ag–Bi mixed layer co-exist alternately.49,50 For Cu doping, all possible substitutional sites were considered and the Ag site in the Ag layer was identified as the most energetically favorable position for Cu, as shown in Fig. S7 and S8.†
We first calculated the electronic density of states (DOS) to understand the relative energy levels of Cu in SBI. Fig. 6a, b and S9† show the comparison of the DOS of SBI before and after Cu doping. The valence band (VB) was constructed by the hybridization between the Ag d-orbital and I p-orbital, while the conduction band (CB) was made by the hybridization between the Bi p-orbital and I p-orbital. As Cu substitutes Ag in the Ag layer, additional Cu d-orbitals (blue) appear in the VB of SBI, as seen in Fig. 6b. Particularly, an additional state made by the hybridization between the Cu p-orbital and I p-orbital is present at the top of the VB. On the other hand, the CB does not change significantly by Cu doping. We further analyzed the partial charge density of the VB and CB to clarify the change in absorption for SBI by Cu doping since absorption is proportional to the overlap between the VB and CB. Fig. 6c and d show the spatial distributions of the overlap between the VB and CB before and after Cu doping, respectively; the overlap was calculated by the Hadamard product between the charge density of the VB and CB (Poverlap = ρVB × ρCB). Without Cu doping, the overlap is weakly seen in several small areas (yellow) around Ag atoms in the Ag layers (Fig. 6c). With the Cu doping, a strong overlap around the Cu atom is observed as can be seen from the yellow isosurface in Fig. 6d. As a result, Cu doping increases the total amount of overlap by 20.2% compared with bare SBI.
 Fig. 6  Accumulated orbital decomposed partial density of states of the I p-orbital (purple), Ag d-orbital (cyan), Cu d-orbital (blue), and Bi p-orbital (orange) of SBI (a) and Cu:SBI (b). Total DOS is plotted using the filled gray curve for comparison. Spatial distribution of the overlap between the VB and CB for SBI (c) and Cu:SBI (d). Isosurface (yellow) is shown in the level of 3 × 10−4 e2 Å−6. The atomic color of iodine, silver, copper, and bismuth are purple, cyan, blue, and orange, respectively. 
In summary, the Cu d-band is located at the top of the VB of SBI. Hence, Cu doping does not significantly modify its bandgap, although the bandgap is slightly decreased because of structural distortion. Our DFT calculations predict that the 0.3% decrease in the lattice constant reduces only 0.01 eV of the bandgap of SBI. Thus, the change in the bandgap due to the reduction of the lattice constant induced by Cu doping is negligible. On the other hand, additional VB states made by the Cu d-orbital significantly increase the overlap with the conduction band (CB), which leads to a considerable increase of the light absorption coefficient.
Then, we analyzed the charge transport behavior of Cu-doped SBI. Considering the CB position of TiO2 and the HOMO level of PTAA, a slight energy band shift caused by Cu-doping will have little effect on charge transport from the light absorber to TiO2 and PTAA.
To analyze the charge transfer dynamics of SBI and Cu:SBI (2.5, 5, and 10 mol%), we applied transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS). Specifically, we measured the transient absorption (TA) spectra of FTO/TiO2/SBI and FTO/TiO2/Cu:SBI with photoexcitation at 355 nm, as shown in Fig. 7. In the TA spectra in Fig. 7a–d, two features are observed: a negative feature at 550–600 nm, which corresponds to the ground state bleaching and a positive feature at 600–750 nm, which corresponds to the excited state absorption. Both features reflect the dynamics of the excited states of SBI. It should be noted that the amplitudes of the TA spectra of the FTO/TiO2/Cu:SBI devices were much smaller at time zero than those of the bare SBI-based device, while their differences depending on the Cu-doping concentrations were not significant. The amplitude of the TA spectrum at time zero reflects the decay dynamics in the time region earlier than the time resolution (∼7 ns) of the TAS measurements. Therefore, the smaller amplitude of the TA spectrum of FTO/TiO2/Cu:SBI at time zero indicates that the charge injection into TiO2 occurs more efficiently from Cu:SBI than from bare SBI. However, a further increase of the Cu-doping concentration over 2.5% does not appreciably enhance the charge injection rate.
 Fig. 7  TA spectra of SBI (a), Cu2.5:SBI (b), Cu5:SBI (c) and Cu10:SBI (d) devices, and temporal decays of TA spectra of each device at 650 nm (e). The decays were fitted by a single exponential with a constant, I(t) = Ae−t/τ + B. 
In Fig. 7e, the temporal decays of the TA spectra at 650 nm wavelength are compared for FTO/TiO2/SBI and various FTO/TiO2/Cu:SBI devices. The decays were fitted by a single exponential with a constant, I(t) = Ae−t/τ + B, giving time constants (τ) of 489, 413, 349 and 256 ns for FTO/TiO2/SBI, FTO/TiO2/Cu2.5:SBI, FTO/TiO2/Cu5:SBI and FTO/TiO2/Cu10:SBI, respectively. Detailed parameters are listed in Table S1.† The temporal decays on the time scale of hundreds of ns would correspond to the charge recombination dynamics, and Cu10:SBI exhibits the fastest charge recombination.
As a result, for the device with a low Cu-doping concentration such as SC-Cu2.5-SBI, the effects of charge injection and charge recombination are likely to cancel out each other, and the improvement of PCE by Cu doping can be mainly attributed to the increase of the absorption coefficient. However, for the device with a high Cu-doping level such as SC-Cu5:SBI and SC-Cu10:SBI, PV properties could be deteriorated mainly due to the considerable increase in charge recombination.
Finally, we monitored the device stability under humid conditions for the as-prepared solar cell devices of CH3NH3PbI3 (SC-MAPbI3), SC-SBI, and SC-Cu2.5:SBI. Particularly, the long-term stability of these PSC devices was evaluated by monitoring the J–V characteristics for the devices stored at a chamber with a relative humidity of 50 ± 5% at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 8, SC-SBI shows much higher long-term stability than the PSC with MAPbI3. In addition, SC-Cu2.5-SBI shows comparable stability to SC-SBI, indicating that Cu doping does not modify the stability of Ag2BiI5-based solar cells.

As demonstrated, the results of this work will greatly contribute to the design and development of efficient silver bismuth iodide-based solar cells.
Experimental
Preparation of polycrystalline SBI and various Cu:SBIs
Ag2BiI5 was prepared by mixing and grinding 2 mmol AgI (99.9%, Alfa Aesar) and 1 mmol BiI3 (99%, Sigma Aldrich) for 30 min in an Ar environment. Cu:SBI powders of various Cu concentrations were prepared by adding stoichiometric amounts of CuI (99.999%, Sigma Aldrich) to replace AgI. In particular, Cu2.5:SBI (Ag1.95Cu0.05BiI5) was prepared by mixing and grinding 1.95 mmol AgI, 0.05 mmol CuI, and 1 mmol BiI3 in an Ar environment. Then, a Pyrex tube was filled with the powders, and evacuated to 1.5 × 10−3 Torr using a rotary pump. Under these condition, the tube was sealed using a torch and then kept at 480 °C for 12 h. The collected SBI and various Cu:SBI powders were gently ground in an Ar environment.
Preparation of SBI and Cu:SBI coating solutions
The SBI or various Cu:SBI coating solutions were prepared by dissolving the corresponding powders in the mixture of DMSO (Aldrich) and DMF (Aldrich) with a volume ratio of 3:2. Specifically, the coating solutions of 0.25 M, 0.35 M, 0.45 M, and 0.55 M concentrations were prepared by dissolving 0.5, 0.7, 0.9, and 1.1 mmol of SBI (or Cu:SBI) powders, respectively, in the mixed solvents to prepare 2 mL solutions. The solutions were then magnetically stirred under an Ar atmosphere for 2 h and purple-colored neat solutions were obtained.
Fabrication of solar cell devices
FTO substrates (30 × 30 mm, Pilkington TEC8) were partially etched with zinc powder and 0.2 M HCl solution. For preparation of a TiO2 blocking layer, a ∼10 nm-thick Ti film was deposited on the FTO substrate using a RF magnetron sputtering system (A-Tech system), followed by oxidation at 500 °C for 30 min in air to convert Ti to TiO2. Then, a mesoporous TiO2 layer with ∼400 nm thickness was prepared by spin-coating of the TiO2 paste derived from the 50 nm-sized TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) at 6000 rpm for 20 s and subsequent calcination at 500 °C for 30 min in air. For TiCl4 treatment, the mesoporous TiO2 substrate was immersed in an aqueous solution of 0.03 M TiCl4 at 90 °C for 20 min, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 30 min.
Then, about 0.06 mL of SBI or Cu:SBI coating solution was dropped on the surface of mesoporous TiO2 layers. After 30 s, the films were spun at 4000 rpm for 20 s. For the antisolvent treatment to control the film surface, 1 mL of ethyl ether was dropped in 10 s after the start of spin coating. The coated films were then heat-treated at 150 °C for 10 min on a hot plate. Pristine PTAA (EM Index, Mw = 17600 g mol−1) was used as the hole transporting layer (HTL). That is, the solution of 15 mg PTAA dissolved in 1 mL toluene without adding any additives was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s. For the back contact, the Ag film with a thickness of ∼80 nm was deposited using a thermal evaporator (Korea Vacuum Tech.).
Measurements and characterization
Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurements were performed using a source measurement unit (Model 2400, Keithley). A solar simulator (Model K730, McScience) with AM 1.5 G intensity was used as the light source and the light intensity was adjusted using an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with a KG-5 filter. The solar cell devices were masked with a non-reflective black metal aperture to define the active area, typically 0.122 cm2, while the active area of each device was measured using an optical microscope. In the measurement of J–V curves, the scan rate was 100 mV s−1, and the dwelling time before the voltage scan was 20 s. Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) was measured as a function of wavelength from 300 nm to 800 nm using an IPCE system specially designed for dye-sensitized solar cells (PV Measurements, Inc.).
First-principle calculations were performed under spin-polarized DFT formalism with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof of exchange-correlation functional by the Vienna ab initio simulation package.51 The cut-off energy of the plane wave basis was set to 450 eV. The stop criterion for electronic and ionic steps was 10−6 eV and 10−2 eV Å−1, respectively. The k-points were sampled from gamma centered 6 × 4 × 2 grids for ionic relaxation and 12 × 8 × 4 grids for DOS calculations. We modeled the SBI crystal structure from the partially occupied experimental Rm crystal structure with lattice parameters of a = 4.350 Å and c = 20.820 Å.49 Since the known experimental structure (Ag12/5Bi6/5I6) has a fractional stoichiometry on Ag and Bi sites, the experimental structure was expanded to maintain integer stoichiometry. In this study, the Ag12Bi6I30 supercell is constructed by multiplying the matrix [[210], [130], [001]] which yields the integer stoichiometry by the minimum transform (Fig. S5†) To consider partial occupancy of Ag and Bi, we generated 125000 configurations and evaluated the electrostatic energy of all possible configurations by using the formal charge of I (−1), Ag (+1), Cu (+1), and Bi (+3) through Ewald summation implementation in pymatgen.52 Then, we selected 10 symmetrically different lowest energy configurations and performed DFT calculations. Finally, the system with the lowest DFT energy among 10 different configurations was chosen for the model of SBI. For Cu doping, we performed DFT calculations for 12 substitutional sites in Ag12Bi6I30 and chose the system with the lowest DFT energy for the model of Cu:SBI. When evaluating the partial charge density of the VB and CB, we consider the entire k-points for each band and only one band below (VB) and above (CB) the Fermi level, respectively. We used VMD53 and VESTA54 as visualization software.
TAS measurements were performed with a nanosecond transient absorption spectrometer (LP980, Edinburgh Instruments).55 The pump laser pulses of 355 nm wavelength, 5 ns duration, and 0.34 mJ per pulse generated from a wavelength-tunable Nd:YAG laser (NT342A, Ekspla) were focused to a spot of 10 × 18 mm2 from the FTO substrate side of the FTO/TiO2/SBI sample under ambient conditions, giving the excitation fluence of 0.19 mJ cm−2 per pulse. A pulsed (6 ms duration) Xe arc lamp was used as a probe source. The transient change in the absorption of the sample was measured in real time with a PMT detector and a digital oscilloscope of 200 MHz bandwidth. The time resolution of the TA measurements was 7 ns. The TAS measurements were repeated multiple (at least three) times for each type of device to check the reproducibility of the TA data.
Conclusions
Up to 10 mol%, doping Cu into the Ag site of Ag2BiI5 did not appreciably modify the crystallographic structure or bandgap of SBI, but it significantly increased light absorption in the wavelength range of 400–700 nm. Particularly, the light absorption of Cu:SBI reached an optimum level with 2.5 mol% Cu doping, whereas an additional increase in the Cu doping level did not influence the absorption much. In application as a light absorber of n–i–p type solar cells, the optimum PCE was achieved with SC-Cu2.5:SBI, which exhibits a PCE of 2.53% with a VOC of 619 mV, JSC of 7.13 mA cm−2 and FF of 57.25%. Compared with SC-SBI, SC-Cu2.5:SBI exhibits the improvement of PCE by 25%, mainly due to the considerable increase in JSC. Therefore, the increase in solar light absorption by Cu doping must be responsible for the PCE enhancement. The result of DFT calculations indicates that the added Cu significantly increases the DOS at the top of the SBI VB, whereas the CB does not change significantly. As a result, Cu doping can induce a considerable increase in the total amount of the Hadamard product between the charge density of the VB and CB, leading to the increase in the light absorption coefficient of SBI. On the other hand, the results of TAS measurements indicate that doping Cu into SBI expedites electron injection into TiO2 but induces faster charge recombination. As a result, the effects of these two properties are likely to cancel out each other, thus indicating that the PCE improvement by Cu doping is mainly due to the increase of the absorption coefficient. Moreover, SC-Cu2.5-SBI shows comparable stability to SC-SBI, indicating that Cu doping does not modify the stability of SBI-based solar cells.
