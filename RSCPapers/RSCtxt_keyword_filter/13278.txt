    , Accepted 28th August 2019First published on 28th August 2019AbstractTwo metal free organic dyes (TPCTh and TPCRh) with D–A–π–A configuration, having 3-cyanopyridine as an auxiliary acceptor and thiophene π-linkers along with a triphenylamine donor and cyanoacetic acid/rhodanine-3-acetic acid anchoring groups, were successfully synthesized and utilized as sensitizers in the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The opto-electronic properties of TPCTh and TPCRh were compared with the model sensitizer CCTh having carbazole as the donor and cyanoacetic acid as the anchoring group. Both the dyes showed red shifted absorption spectra compared to the standard CCTh dye. Also, TPCRh showed a broader absorption spectrum with a reduced band gap compared to TPCTh. However, theoretical studies indicate that the unavailability of excited state conjugation over the anchoring group could lead to restricted charge injection for the TPCRh dye, whereas the TPCTh dye exhibits complete conjugation over the entire molecule. The photovoltaic performance of the TPCTh dye was found to be better compared with the standard CCTh sensitizer as a result of better absorption contributed by the lower band gap in TPCTh leading to improved photon-light conversion and thus an improved Jsc of 11 mA cm−2 over the 7.12 mA cm−2 of CCTh. In addition, lifetime measurements corroborated a lower electron lifetime for TPCRh compared to TPCTh and CCTh.
Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are an inexpensive alternative compared to conventional first and second generation solar cells, as they mimic natural photosynthesis and are fabricated using organic dye materials as sensitizers.1–4 The performance and stability of DSSC devices mainly depend on the nature of the sensitizers, electrodes and electrolytes and also on the nature of the interaction between these components. Often the sensitizer plays a crucial role in improving the device efficiency and hence a lot of research is underway in the development of new and novel sensitizers. New metal free organic sensitizers have been explored due to their high molar extinction coefficients, low cost, non-toxicity, easy tunability of spectral characteristics and simple synthetic methods.5–8
The most popular design for metal free organic dyes for DSSCs is a donor–π–spacer–acceptor (D–π–A)9,10 model with cyanoacetic acid as the most commonly used acceptor. The donor and π-bridge were structurally varied to get new dyes with variable optoelectronic properties.11–13 However, there are many other architectures proposed with an additional donor (D–D–π–A),14,15 or spacer (D–π–π–A),16 or with the introduction of an extra auxiliary acceptor (D–A–π–A)11,17,18 for better chemico-structural designs to obtain low cost dyes by easy synthetic methodologies without compromising the dye stability and device performance, as required for commercial applications. Even though cyanoacetic acid is usually the preferred anchoring group due to its cost effectiveness and easy synthesis, other acceptors, like rhodanine-3-acetic acid, are also used and some of their derivatives show red shifts and broad absorption bands compared to cyanoacetic acid dye derivatives.19,20
The present work involves the design of new D–A–π–A architectures bearing 3-cyanopyridine as an auxiliary acceptor. These new architectures have been designed specifically based on the variation of the donor and acceptor systems over the previously reported CCTh dye.21 The structure of the new dyes TPCTh and TPCRh and their model dye (CCTh) are shown in Fig. 1. Triphenylamine (TPA) has been used as the donor,22 which will increase the electron-donating nature, and thiophene is used as the π-spacer. Cyanoacetic acid and rhodanine-3-acid acceptors are used in the design strategy and their influence is investigated in detail on the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis of the dyes is as shown in Scheme 1. The intermediate cyanopyridone derivative 2 was synthesized by a method reported in the literature23,24 and compound 3 was synthesized by Williamson ether synthesis from compound 2. Coupling of 3 with (5-formylthiophen-2-yl)boronic acid via a Suzuki reaction gives the formylated intermediate 4. Finally, dyes TPCTh and TPCRh were obtained by coupling of compound 4 through a Knoevenagel condensation reaction with cyanoacetic acid and rhodanine-3-acetic acid, respectively.

Optical properties
Optical absorption measurements were performed in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) at a 10−5 M concentration of the dye (Fig. 2(a)). Here, the absorption spectra of new dyes are compared with that of the carbazole counterpart and all the dyes showed a similar high energy band at 278 nm corresponding to a π → π* transition. However, the low energy transitions due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) are different for these dyes. CCTh having a carbazole donor has an absorption band centered at 402 nm and replacing it with the TPA donor (TPCTh) leads to a red shift with the ICT absorption band at 440 nm. Further, the replacement of cyanoacetic acid with the rhodanine-3-acetic acid acceptor (TPCRh) led to a further red shift to 475 nm (as anticipated) resulting from the decreased band gap. The molar extinction coefficient of the dyes slightly decreased from 5.55 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (for CCTh) to 5.01 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (for TPCTh) and then to 3.60 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (for TPCRh). Furthermore, the PL spectra of the dyes are broader and a large Stokes shift is observed in both the dyes, which is more substantial in the TPCTh (110 nm) dye. These large Stokes shifts indicate better photo-stability of the synthesized dyes.25

Fig. 2(b) depicts the absorption spectra of dyes TPCTh and TPCRh anchored over TiO2. The absorption spectrum for TPCTh over TiO2 shows a blue shifted band centered at 438 nm compared to the TPCRh solution indicating deprotonation of carboxylic acid over TiO2. This is due to the fact that carboxylate will have a reduced strength compared to carboxylic acid. This was again confirmed by recording the absorption spectra in the presence of TEA (Fig. S15, ESI†), which shows a blue shifted spectrum due to deprotonation. This was not perceived in the case of TPCRh anchored over TiO2,which showed a red shift in the absorption spectrum (11 nm), indication aggregation. The spectrum recorded in the presence of TEA also corroborates the trend, indicating weak protonation of TPCRh.
Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of these dyes were studied by cyclic voltammetry in acetonitrile vs. NHE and calibrated using Fc/Fc+ (0.63 V vs. NHE) as an external standard. The voltammograms are depicted in Fig. 3(a) and the relevant data are tabulated in Table 1. The first oxidation potentials for TPCTh and TPCRh are 1.09 and 0.98 V (vs. NHE), respectively, and are analogous to their corresponding highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels (Eox). The obtained ground state energy levels are sufficiently low when compared to the redox potential of I−/I3−, which is 0.4 V vs. NHE,26 and this will benefit dye regeneration. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (Eox*) calculated using the equation Eox* = Eox − E0–0 (E0–0 is the band gap estimated from the absorption band edge of the optical spectrum) are −1.29 and −1.28 V, respectively, for TPCTh and TPCRh and the values obtained are more negative than the CB of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE),27 which will guarantee the ease of electron injection from the excited state of the sensitizer to the CB of TiO2. Fig. 3(b) displays the energy level alignment diagram and it is also important to mention that the electrochemical properties of the dyes are alike and make for an efficient charge transfer process.

Theoretical analysis
Computational analysis was performed with density functional theory (DFT) and the structures were optimized using the B3LYP 6-31G(d,p) basis set. Fig. 4 depicts the topologies of the dyes and the parameters are reported in the ESI† (Table S1 and S2). It is found that in the HOMO, the ground state delocalized electrons are distributed over the TPA donor in both the dyes. In the case of TPCTh the excited state electron density is distributed over the acceptor up to the auxiliary acceptor via the π-spacer. But in case of TPCRh the LUMO is not distributed over the carboxylic anchoring group due to the presence of the saturated methylene group, which obstructs the electron injection into the CB of TiO2, and this eventually results in more recombination.28,29 Even though both the dyes possess favorable energy levels and band alignment, recombination hampers the photovoltaic performance of TPCRh.

Photovoltaic performance
Current density–voltage (J–V) characterization of the fabricated DSSCs using the newly synthesized sensitizers TPCTh and TPCRh and the model sensitizer CCTh was carried out under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) simulated light using a class AAA solar simulator. The best optimized device architecture for CCTh showed an average power conversion efficiency of 2.57% (Jsc = 7.13 mA cm−2, Voc = 585 mV and FF = 0.62). Concomitantly, TPCTh exhibited an enhanced power conversion efficiency up to 4.40% (Jsc = 11.05 mA cm−2, Voc = 602 mV and FF = 0.65), followed by TPCRh with a power conversion efficiency of 1.30% (Jsc = 4.69 mA cm−2, Voc = 526 mV and FF = 0.56). The J–V and IPCE plots are depicted in Fig. 5 and the photovoltaic results are compiled in Table 2. Since the absorption profile showed a red shift in TPCTh compared to CCTh (Fig. 2(a)), an increased light harvesting capability and improvement of 54% in Jsc was observed for TPCTh compared to standard CCTh. The red shift in TPCTh compared to CCTh is also observed in the IPCE. Unlike TPCTh, even with slightly red shifted absorption TPCRh showed a decrease in Jsc by 43% and 58% compared to CCTh and TPCTh respectively. This can only happen if the device is more prone to recombination. Detailed recombination analysis is done in a further section using charge extraction and EIS techniques. TPCTh showed a slight improvement in Voc of 17 mV compared to standard CCTh. However, a substantial decrement of 76 mV was observed in TPCRh compared to model device CCTh. This could be because dyes with rhodanine-3-acetic acid acceptors are more prone to recombination. The 70% improvement in efficiency in TPCTh compared to CCTh is attributed to red shifted absorption leading to a higher Jsc. The 49% decrease in efficiency using TPCRh is due to the higher recombination in the device, which resulted in lower Voc and Jsc even though the absorption was red shifted. We have also carried out a detailed CDCA concentration study with the most efficient dye i.e.TPCTh and it is observed that the efficiency of TPCTh increases, which indicates reduced aggregation of the dye after CDCA addition.

We further carried out incident photon current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements for CCTh, TPCTh, and TPCRh. As displayed in Fig. 5(b)CCTh shows a maximum IPCE of 68% at 400 nm, while TPCTh showed a superior IPCE of 73% at 400 nm, followed by TPCRh with a maximum IPCE of 41% at 330–340 nm. The IPCE spectra of the three dyes are in agreement with the J–V curves measured under one sun irradiation.
The TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface plays a critical role in determining the photovoltaic performance in DSSCs.30,31 The TiO2 electrolyte junction modulates the kinetics of the device, which needs to be precisely studied in such a way to unveil the origin of the J–V parameters.32–34 The charge transfer dynamics at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface was investigated employing electrical as well as light perturbation techniques.

Fig. 6(a) shows the charge extraction measurement data plotted for CCTh, TPCTh and TPCRh. The voltage as a function of extracted charge for CCTh, TPCTh and TPCRh overlapped with each other, which confirms little alternation in the position of the TiO2 conduction band irrespective of the structural variations in the dyes. Further, to understand the transport phenomena in these devices, we carried out intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopic (IMPS) measurements. Fig. 6(b) shows the transport time as a function of the LED current, which was determined from IMPS measurements by using the equation  where fmax is the highest frequency in the Bode plot obtained from the measurement. The charge transport time, which is the manifestation of the time taken for diffusion of electrons in the TiO2 matrix, apparently remained unchanged for all the three dyes (CCTh, TPCTh and TPCRh).

Charge recombination phenomena were investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 7(a) and (b) show the resultant Nyquist plot and lifetime plots for CCTh, TPCTh and TPCRh. The Nyquist plot for DSSCs typically consists of three semicircles, which are associated with three different charge transfer processes. The semicircle at higher frequency corresponds to the charge transfer at the platinum/electrolyte interface, and the semicircle at intermediate frequency corresponds to the charge dynamics at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The diameter of the semicircle at intermediate frequency can be used as a tool to determine the recombination and lifetime. The third semicircle at lower frequency is attributed to the diffusion of ions in the electrolyte. From the Nyquist plot it is evident that TPCTh is endowed with higher recombination resistance, followed by CCTh and TPCRh. TPCTh and CCTh exhibited longer lifetimes compared to TPCRh. The detailed results are given in Fig. S16 and Table S3 (ESI†). The higher recombination resistance and longer lifetime helped TPCTh and CCTh to yield proportionally higher Jsc and Voc compared to TPCRh. The broad and red shifted absorption in TPCRh didn’t give improved device performance as a result of higher recombination. Similar trends were also observed by T. Marinado et al.2 where dyes with rhodanine acceptors resulted in higher recombination, which badly affected Jsc, Voc, FF and the overall performance of the devices.

Conclusion
We report the synthesis and photovoltaic performance of a new class of D–A–π–A organic dyes consisting of TPA as a donor, 3-cyanopyridine as an auxiliary acceptor, and thiophene as a spacer along with cyanoacetic acid (TPCTh) and rhodanine-3-acetic acid (TPCRh) as acceptor groups. The structure–property relationship and photovoltaic performance were compared with the model dye CCTh. Both the newly synthesized dyes showed distinctive photophysical and electrochemical properties with broader and red shifted absorption spectra compared to CCTh. However, theoretical studies revealed that the non-conjugated end of carboxylic acid due to the presence of the methylene group reduced the charge transfer from the dye excited state to the CB of TiO2 for TPCRh. The photovoltaic properties of TPCTh were better compared to CCTh as it comprised a better TPA donor with a broader absorption spectrum and reduced band gap. Hence, TPCTh showed a higher Jsc of 11 mA cm−2 and efficiency of 4.42% compared to CCTh with an efficiency of 2.59%. TPCRh with higher recombination and a lower electron lifetime showed lower Voc, Jsc and FF with an efficiency of only 1.39%. Triphenylamine appended dye TPCTh showed better light harvesting properties as clearly visible from the IPCE spectra as compared to its carbazole based analogue dye and the one with a rhodanine acid binding group. This helped TPCTh in attaining a higher short circuit current density leading to better performance than the parent CCTh dye. Even though red shifted absorption was achieved for TPCRh, higher recombination led to a lower lifetime, resulting in much lower photovoltaic performance.
