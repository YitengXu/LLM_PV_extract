    , Accepted 24th January 2011First published on 7th February 2011AbstractA facile, all chemical bath deposition process to fabricate CdSe (quantum dots) solar cells is presented, which is free from mesoporous metal oxides, high-temperature annealing and ligand encapsulation, showing great perspective in cost-effectiveness, reproducibility and flexibility.

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been attracting enormous attention because of their high efficiency and relatively inexpensive fabrication procedure compared to conventional solid-state solar cells and/or inorganic cells. DSSCs are based on photosensitization of mesoporous TiO2 films by adsorbed sensitizers. In this application, ruthenium complexes and organic dyes are commonly exploited as sensitizers and a power conversion efficiency of up to 11% has been achieved.1 In yet another approach, recent advancement on the next-generation pure-inorganic sensitizers such as II–VI and III–V quantum dots (QDs) has been in fast progress. Quantum dots offer several advantages over organic/organometallic dyes, such as facile tuning size and hence the light harvesting band gap, together with high extinction coefficient as well as the superior thermal and photochemical stability.2–5 Moreover, it has a latent potential to utilize hot electrons to generate multiple electron–hole pairs per photon through the impact ionization effect.6
To prepare QDs on the mesoporous metal oxides, two main approaches can be summarized: (1) QDs were synthesized via surface capping, followed by the attachment onto the surface of metal oxides using the spin casting method (or other ways).7,8 (2) Growing QDs onto the metal oxide electrodesvia either chemical bath deposition (CBD) or successive ionic layer adsorption reaction (SILAR) processes using various types of semiconducting precursors.9–13 The latter approaches involve the dissolution of cationic and anionic precursors into two separated containers. To each solution, the bare conductive glass, being coated with a mesoporous metal oxide, is then immersed alternatively to grow the desired QDs. The metal oxide electrodes then require further annealing at high temperature, e.g. ∼500 °C for TiO2, to achieve crystallinity, and hence the enhancement of electron transporting abilities. The efficiency of the as prepared pure CdSe QDs sensitized solar cell which uses a mesoporous metal oxide as a supporting layer is usually lower than 3%.9–11 Such a high-temperature annealing process greatly limits both types of QDs being able to be applied and the usage of plastic substrates to make flexible photovoltaic devices. It may also act in a diametrically opposite way against the cost-effective issue in fabrication. We report herein a facile CBD process to fabricate a CdSe based inorganic-type solar cell free from both the mesoporous metal oxide, high temperature annealing and surfactants. The optimized CdSe solar cell can reproducibly reach 2.5% conversion efficiency. Detail of the progress en route to optimum performance is described as follows.
To carry out the new CBD process (see Scheme 1) for the deposition of CdSe on the substrates, FTO glasses were immersed into an ethanol solution containing 0.5 M Cd(NO3)2 for 30 min at 40 °C, after being fully rinsed with ethanol, and then immersed into the ethanol solution containing 0.5 M Na2SeSO3 for another 7 h at 40 °C. Such an alternate immersing procedure is defined as one CBD cycle. Different from most of the previously reported CBD methods,9–11 the current synthetic protocol requires low-temperature reaction as well as elongation of immersing time in forming a film of CdSe QDs. More importantly, this protocol is also free from the use of mesoporous metal oxides, the surface of which commonly serves as the supporting layer. Without the surface encapsulation, the amount and hence the thickness of CdSe on FTO should increase via each repeating CBD cycle. The adverse effect lies in that CdSe might eventually become too thick to allow proper electron/hole diffusion length. The optimization thus depends on the concentration of each precursor solution and the number of CBD cycles. Under current experimental condition, 6–7 CBD cycles were found to have optimum performance (vide infra). Fig. 1 shows the corresponding UV-Vis spectrum and SEM images of the as prepared CdSe film. The UV-Vis spectrum reveals an obvious shoulder around 670 nm that can be assigned to the characteristic excitonic band of CdSe nanoparticles. By using the empirical equations derived by Yu et al.,14 together with the TEM image (see Fig. S1, ESI†), we then estimated the diameter of CdSe particles in solution to be in the range of 7 nm. As shown in SEM images (see Fig. 1b), this CdSe film is composed of aggregates of these CdSe nanoparticles, which pack together in a large area of domain (see inset of Fig. 1b) with a thickness of ∼100 nm measured at the cross section of the film by tiling the holder angle in SEM. To examine the photovoltaic performances, the CdSe sensitized electrode and a Pt-coated counter electrode were sandwiched using 25 μm thick sealing materials. The cell with an active area of 0.16 cm2 is then filled with Na2S/S coupled electrolytes in water/methanol solventvia injection (see experimental section in ESI† for details).15 For consistency, five samples of CdSe films were prepared in parallel following the same procedures. Note that the device made is free from mesoporous metal oxides such as TiO2 and is named as device FTO/CdSe.

The I–V curve of device FTO/CdSe is shown in Fig. 2. While the current densities (Jsc) are as high as 12.95 mA cm−2, the open-circuit voltages (Voc) were measured to be only 0.37 V. The filled factor (FF) was accordingly calculated to be 0.26. This gave a power conversion efficiency of 1.25%. Though being low, the 1.25% power conversion efficiency is relatively higher than that of the mesoporous TiO2 based pure CdSe sensitized solar cells.9,11 It is believed that the inferiority in both electron transporting behavior at the FTO/CdSe interface and the morphology of the CdSe film should account for low Voc and FF. Upon excitation, free electrons in the conduction band of CdSe flow downward to the FTO electrode. However, the inefficient charge separation at the interface in between CdSe and FTO may retard the electron injection to the electrode; thus, excitons would be deactivated through other undesired pathways such as recombination or defect trapping. The net result should decrease the shunt resistance and hence cause the drop of Voc and FF.

See text for detailed description. (b) Incident photon to electron efficiency (IPCE) of device FTO/TiO2/F/CdSe. 
For further improvement, we next constructed the photoelectrochemical cells incorporating an ultra-thin, compact TiO2 layer between substrates (FTO) and the thin film made of CdSe nanoparticles. In this approach, FTO glasses were pre-treated with TiCl4 prior to performing the aforementioned CBD process. It has been well established that dipping FTO glasses into the TiCl4 aqueous solution at ∼70 °C leads to formation of an ultra-thin layer of TiO2 (<2 nm) on the surface of the designated substrates.16 We expect that insertion of this TiO2 layer may serve as a gradient to improve contact within FTO/TiO2/CdSe surfaces. A device fabricated in this way is denoted as FTO/TiO2/CdSe, and the corresponding energy diagram is shown in Fig. S2 of ESI.†Table 1 lists the pertinent parameters of cell performance as a function of immersing time of FTO into the TiCl4 (0.04 M) aqueous solution. Obviously, upon implementing this ultra-thin TiO2 layer, significant improvement was observed on Voc and FF, which increased to 0.42 V and 0.35, respectively (cf. 0.37 V and 0.26 in the FTO/CdSe cell), at an immersing time of 1.5 h and then started decreasing at e.g. 2.0 h (see Table 1). A maximum power conversion efficiency of 2.01% was thus achieved for this series of FTO/TiO2/CdSe cells.

In comparison to the devices fabricated with mesoporous metal oxide electrodes,9–11 the current devices offer higher Jsc but somewhat lower Voc and FF. For the QDs based solar cell coated with a metal oxide layer on the substrates, it has been well established that efficient charge migration from CdSe toward the TiO2 layer suppresses other unfavorable pathways. As a result, the shunt resistance is increased, avoiding the loss of Voc and FF. With pre-treatment of TiCl4, both higher FF and Voc of FTO/TiO2/CdSe imply that the ultra-thin TiO2 layer not only blocks the hole toward FTO but also facilitates the electron transfer efficiency from CdSe to electrode. This viewpoint may be supported by the EIS spectra of the FTO/CdSe and FTO/TiO2/CdSe under illumination of simulated AM 1.5 solar light shown in Fig. 3. The higher recombination resistance of FTO/TiO2/CdSe compared to that of the FTO/CdSe affirms the key role of the ultra-thin TiO2 layer inserted between the QDs active layer and the FTO electrode.17 In this study, the optimum immersing time was found to be 1.5 h. Longer immersing time of substrates into the TiCl4 solution formed thicker TiO2, resulting in an increase of the series resistance and hence the reduction of Jsc.

In an aim to enhance the charge transfer efficiency of the devices, prior to the CBD deposition of CdSe, the TiCl4 pre-treated FTO was then further immersed into 1 M NH4F aqueous solution.17 A number of studies have reported that depositing F− ion on the interface of an electrode and an active layer (e.g.CdSe film) may act as an effective electron guide because of its high electronegativity. In other words, the F− ion plays an important role by providing a directional (active layer → electrode) pathway to facilitate the electron transfer toward the FTO electrode.18 We then made optimization of the cell performance as a function of the immersing time (into 1 M NH4F solution), the corresponding data of which are listed in Table S1 of ESI.† Note that the incorporation behavior of the F− ion on the ultra-thin TiO2 layer reaches saturation at 2 min. As shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1 (also Table S1, ESI†), the optimized FTO/TiO2/F/CdSe cell reaches an overall power conversion efficiency of 2.51% with Jsc = 14.55 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.42 V and FF = 0.41, showing a further improvement compared to both FTO/CdSe and FTO/TiO2/CdSe devices. As a result, the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE, see Fig. 2b) achieves >50% in the range of 400–670 nm. As shown in Fig. 2a, the efficiency of the as prepared device only slightly drops to 2.25% after 45 days exposure to room light at ambient temperature, supporting its great stability.
We have thus demonstrated a facile, all chemical bath deposition process to prepare CdSe QDs onto FTO in situ (see Scheme 1). The corresponding FTO/CdSe solar cell is free from mesoporous metal oxides and has attained a decent conversion efficiency (∼1.25%) in a liquid electrolyte (Na2S/S) configuration. Pre-treatment of TiCl4 and TiCl4/NH4F on FTO glasses, forming an ultra-thin film TiO2, leads to FTO/TiO2/CdSe and FTO/TiO2/F/CdSe types of cell configuration, which provides further increase of conversion efficiency to 2.01% and 2.51%, respectively. In sum, the low-temperature, surfactant free CBD method invented in this study has its advantages in: (1) safety and cost-effectiveness due to the surfactant-free process such that the toxic evaporation process and cost in treatment of wasted materials are minimized, (2) reproducibility due to simple dipping methodology, together with the low-temperature (<70 °C) fabrication process, leading to good quality control of device making and hence feasibility in scale-up production, (3) prospect in future fabrication toward flexible devices. The results presented herein thus pave a new avenue en route to the ideal QDs-based photovoltaic devices.
