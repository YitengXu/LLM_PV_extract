    , Accepted 18th October 2021First published on 18th October 2021AbstractThe application of doctor-blading for flexible solar cells is considerably attractive due to its potential upscaling feasibility via a roll-to-roll process. Herein, we report the fabrication of efficient flexible Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells by doctor-blading under ambient conditions. The device efficiency is improved from 2.22% to 5.01% by Na incorporation, while the further enhancement is limited by inhomogeneous grain growth. To address this issue, we develop an alternative blading strategy via coating Na-containing and Na-free molecular inks by turns. By carefully tailoring this combination, compact and homogeneous CZTSSe films with large grains are obtained. Meanwhile, an appropriate amount of Na incorporation is found to be beneficial for grain growth, carrier transport, and defect passivation. Consequently, a flexible device with an efficiency of 9.63% based on the doctor-blading method is achieved. This work paves the way for the future upscaling of flexible CZTSSe solar cells via low-cost solution methods.
Introduction
Kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) is considered as an emerging light absorber, as it satisfies the goals for the fabrication of low-cost, environment-friendly, and efficient thin film solar cells.1 The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CZTSSe solar cells based on a classical rigid soda-lime glass (SLG) substrate is 12.6% so far,2,3 demonstrating the potential of this material. One of the great advantages of thin film solar cells in comparison with crystalline silicon-based devices is the feasibility to be prepared on flexible substrates. Furthermore, the application of flexible solar cells can be significantly expanded to many advanced areas, such as building-integrated photovoltaics,4 a power source for wearable or portable electronic devices,5 and automotive applications.6
In recent years, flexible CZTSSe solar cells have attracted considerable attention. Different approaches have been applied to fabricate flexible CZTSSe devices, including magnetic sputtering,7,8 spin coating,9–13 doctor-blading,14 electrochemical deposition15 and the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method.16 Yang et al.7 reported 10.34% efficient flexible CZTSSe solar cells based on sputtering by using a multi-layered structure, and they inserted a NaF layer between Mo foil and the precursor to incorporate Na. Recently, they achieved an efficiency of 11.19% by applying NaF between Cu and Sn layers.8 As for non-vacuum processes, T. Todorov et al. achieved 11.5% efficiency on an ultrathin ceramic substrate via a hydrazine-based pure solution approach.17 Cheng's group prepared flexible CZTS solar cells based on a non-hydrazine solution and spin coating method in a N2-filled glovebox.9 Through the optimization of cation substitutions,10 selenization conditions,11 and deposition parameters of buffer layers,12 they improved the efficiency from 2.25% to 9.04%, and achieved a symmetrical bifacial CZTSSe solar cell with PCEs of 9.3% and 9%.13
In addition to efficiency improvements, the development of deposition techniques, which are compatible with large scale production and allow for the reduction of manufacturing cost, is also essential for the widespread application of flexible solar cells. Doctor-blading can fulfill these expectations, as it is a simple method with low material wastage and feasibility to be coupled with the high-throughput roll-to-roll process for large scale production.18 Although this technique has been extensively used in the fabrication of organic19,20 and perovskite solar cells,21,22 there are only a few reports based on doctor-blading regarding CZTSSe solar cells on either rigid Mo substrates or flexible substrates. Schnabel et al. reported a 7.5% efficient CZTSSe solar cell on a rigid Mo substrate fabricated by doctor-blading.23 They further improved the PCE to 9.1% by optimizing the annealing process, which is increased to 10.3% by applying an antireflective coating layer of MgF2.24 In terms of the flexible CZTSSe solar cell, the highest PCE is only 6.9% reported by Brew et al., who deposited CZTSSe absorbers by blading the CZTS nanoparticle ink.14 Considering the complexity of the synthesis process of the nanoparticles25 as well as the stability issue of nanoparticle inks,26–28 the molecular ink, which can be simply formulated by dissolving chemicals with a designed ratio into organic solvents, is more preferable. Additionally, the molecular ink method has been widely used to prepare suitable materials and devices, such as kesterite,29,30 chalcopyrite,31 and perovskite.32
In this work, we report the preparation of high-quality CZTSSe thin films on flexible Mo foil via scalable doctor-blading under ambient conditions. Considering that Mo foil is lacking in Na, which is reported to be beneficial for the device performance,33–37 we try to prepare absorbers by blading Na-containing molecular precursor ink. Besides, we develop a new coating method of blading Na-containing ink and Na-free ink alternately to address the issue of cracks in the precursor films. What's more, tailoring the combinations of layers based on Na-containing ink and Na-free ink carefully enables the formation of compact and homogeneous CZTSSe thin films with large grains. It's found that a moderate amount of Na incorporation not only improves the morphology and homogeneity of CZTSSe films, but is also beneficial to suppress the formation of deep-level defects and facilitate the transport of local charges. As a result, a flexible CZTSSe solar cell with a total area efficiency of 9.63% is achieved, which is a record value for flexible CZTSSe devices based on non-hydrazine solution methods.
Results and discussion
The CZTSSe thin film is prepared on Mo foil by firstly coating the Cu–Zn–Sn–S molecular ink via the doctor-blading method in air (Fig. 1(a)), followed by post-selenization at an elevated temperature. The flexible device is completed with subsequential depositions of CdS buffer, i-ZnO, ITO, and Ag grids, as shown in Fig. 1(b).

It is known that Na plays an important role in fabricating high-efficiency CZTSSe solar cells, and it can be supplied either by self-diffusion from SLG during the post-annealing process or by manually doping.38–41 In comparison with traditional rigid Mo substrates on SLG, flexible Mo foil can't offer Na to enhance the quality of the absorber, and therefore Na can only be introduced manually during the fabrication process. Herein, Na is introduced by directly adding Na-containing compounds into the Cu–Zn–Sn–S molecular precursor ink.
Samples based on single Na-free and Na-containing inks are prepared, named Na-0 and Na-all, respectively. Fig. 2(a) shows the J–V curves of Na-0 and Na-all samples under AM 1.5 G illumination. We find that the PCE is improved significantly from 2.22% to 5.01% after introducing Na, which is mainly due to the dramatic increase of the fill factor (FF) from 29.8% to 55.1%, and a slight increase in open circuit voltage (VOC) (from 0.363 V to 0.394 V) and current density (JSC) (from 20.6 mA cm−2 to 23.1 mA cm−2). Both samples show a rapid decline in the external quantum efficiency (EQE) when the wavelength is over 600 nm, as shown in Fig. 2(b), which could result from the undesired junction quality. Our results agree well with reported studies38–41 that Na can help to enhance the device performance.

Furthermore, we study the effect of Na incorporation on the morphology, phases, and properties of the prepared films and corresponding mechanisms. Fig. 2(c and d) show the surface scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of samples Na-0 and Na-all. Compact and large grains are observed in the Na-0 sample (Fig. 2(c)). However, fine grain islands circled by large grains are found in the Na-all sample (Fig. 2(d)). To find out the reason for this difference, the surface morphologies of the precursor films of Na-0 and Na-all were determined (Fig. S1† and 2(e)). It is found that cracks cover the surface. Based on the morphology of the Na-all sample before and after selenization, it is found that larger grains grow along the cracks.
Moreover, the effect of Na incorporation on the crystal growth is studied by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping. The results are shown in Fig. S2.† It can be seen that the Na and Se elements aggregate in the large grains. As discussed in previous reports,8,42–45 the incorporated Na might react with Se and form a liquid NaxSe phase. This liquid phase can assist the diffusion of elements and the crystallization of the material, namely to stimulate the growth of grains. We speculate that, due to the high specific surface area and high surface energy at the cracks, the grain growth starts in this region firstly by reacting with Se, which leads to the inhomogeneous distribution of Se vapor. Meanwhile, Na element diffuses to the cracks and forms NaxSe during the selenization, which promotes the growth of grains at the cracks. Therefore, larger crystalline grains form at the cracks. In contrast, the grain growth in the small grain region is slow and insufficient, which could be due to the relatively lower Se vapor pressure in this region as mentioned above. To conclude, though Na incorporation could help to better the performance of the CZTSSe solar cell, the cracks in the precursor films lead to inhomogeneous grain growth of the absorber, limiting the further improvement of the device performance.
Therefore, it is important to find a way to reduce cracks in the precursor films when incorporating Na. Given that the precursor films made with the Na-free ink show fewer cracks (Fig. S1†) in comparison with films deposited from the Na-containing ink, we develop a new coating process to suppress the formation of cracks and holes in precursor films by coating Na-containing ink and Na-free ink alternately. Apparently, the quality of precursor films is improved, as confirmed by SEM (Fig. 2(f)). To maximize the content of Na in the absorber while keeping the quality, we carefully tailor the number of layers with/without Na. Samples with 1–5 Na-containing layers are labeled Na-1, Na-2, Na-3, Na-4, and Na-5, respectively. Note that the total layers for all the samples are kept as 11.
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) is used to explore the influence of Na incorporation on the crystal structure and the phase properties of the resulting CZTSSe thin films. The results for Na-1–Na-5 films are displayed in Fig. 3(a). As for Na-0 and Na-all samples, the results are shown in Fig. S3(a).† Apart from the strong diffraction peaks corresponding to the Mo substrate, the main diffraction peaks assigned to the (112), (204/220), (116/312), (101), (008/400), and (211) planes of kesterite CZTSSe are also found (CZTS JCPDS 6-0575 and CZTSe JCPDS 52-0868). Additionally, two weak diffraction peaks can also be observed at 2θ = 31.9° and 56.1° for all the samples, which correspond to the (101) and (110) planes of MoSe2.46 No significant difference in XRD spectra is found for all the CZTSSe films, irrespective of the content of Na.

Fig. 3(b) shows the Raman spectra of Na-1–Na-5 samples, and the results for Na-0 and Na-all films are shown in Fig. S3(b).† The Raman bands at around 173 cm−1, 199 cm−1, and 239 cm−1 are detected in all the samples, which can be indexed to the B mode, A mode, and E mode of CZTSSe, respectively.47,48 Additionally, the peak at 327 cm−1 can be assigned to the vibration of the A symmetry mode of CZTS.48 No clear signal from secondary phases could be observed, suggesting that the Na incorporation has no influence on the phase purity of the resulting CZTSSe thin films, which agrees with the XRD results. In addition, compared with the Na-0 sample, there is an obvious increase in the relative intensity of the peaks at around 173 cm−1 for the Na-doped samples. It is reported that the peak at around 173 cm−1 corresponds to two A symmetry modes and two B symmetry modes.49 And the B modes in this region are related mostly to cation vibrations,49 in particular, to the vibrations of Cu/Zn and Cu/Sn atomic planes. Izquierdo-Roca et al.50 found that the number of Cu/Zn and Cu/Sn vibration units increases as the concentration of [ZnCu + VCu] defect clusters decreases. And this is consistent with an increase in the intensity of the B modes and results in the increases of peak intensity at 173 cm−1. Therefore, the enhanced intensity of the 173 cm−1 band with increasing Na content is associated with the reduced concentration of [ZnCu + VCu] defect clusters. Furthermore, a similar trend is also found in the Raman spectra measured with an excitation wavelength of 514 nm (Fig. S4†). Therefore, we confirm that Na incorporation helps to suppress the formation of [ZnCu + VCu] defect clusters.

Fig. 3(c) shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Na 1s for all samples. No Na signal is detected in the Na-1 sample, which could be due to either the low concentration of Na or the insufficient diffusion of Na to the surface, as there is only one Na-containing layer near the back contact in the precursor film. When the number of Na-containing layers is over 2, the Na 1s peak appears. The high-resolution spectra of Cu 2p, Zn 2p, Sn 3d, and Se 3d are shown in Fig. S5.† The magnified XPS spectrum of Cu 2p shows an arrow doublet of peaks situated at 951.7 eV (2p1/2) and 931.9 eV (2p3/2) with a separation of about 19.8 eV, which is in good agreement with the expected binding energy of Cu+ rather than Cu2+.47 The peaks of Zn 2p located at the binding energy of 1044.6 and 1021.6 eV with a separation of 23 eV can be assigned to Zn2+.47 Sn 3d peaks detected at 494.9 and 486.3 eV with a peak splitting of 8.6 eV confirm the existence of Sn4+.47 Weak shoulder peaks (about 496.5 eV) are located near the Sn 3d3/2 peak, which can be assigned to the Zn Auger peak L3M45M45.47 Se 3d peaks that appear at 54.9 eV and 54.0 eV with an energy difference of 0.9 eV reveal the existence of Se2−.47 The XPS analysis confirms that all elements are in their expected oxidation states for all samples.
Secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) measurement is carried out to further analyze the elemental distribution in the CZTSSe film, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 3(d). It can be seen that the content of Cu near the surface is slightly poorer compared with that of the bulk, which could facilitate the generation of VCu near the surface due to the lower formation energy.51 In contrast, the content of Na is higher on top of the absorber. As mentioned by previous studies, Na tends to accumulate at the surface of the copper-based thin films and possibly at the grain boundaries (GBs).38,52 This indicates that Na ions probably occupy the sites of Cu ions on the surface. What's more, according to first-principles studies, the Na dopant leads to the formation of Na-related defects (e.g. NaCu) near the GBs, due to the relatively lower substitution energy.53 Therefore, VCu formed at the GBs can be suppressed by NaCu,54,55 which is consistent with the previous conclusion based on the Raman spectra. Generally, deep defects or defect clusters, like SnZn, SnCu, and [2CuZn + SnZn], have detrimental effects on the performance of CZTSSe solar cells, such as the formation of band tailing and the increase of the VOC deficit. However, Na-related defects are beneficial for suppressing the formation of deep-level defects and help to improve the performance by stimulating carrier transport.51

Fig. 4 shows the top-view SEM images of Na-1–Na-5 samples after annealing. The grain size of the films with Na incorporation is bigger than that of the Na-free sample (Fig. 2(c)). Large grains accompanied by fine grains can be observed in samples Na-1, Na-2, and Na-3. When the number of Na-containing layers is up to 4, films with compact and uniform large grains are obtained (Fig. 4(d)). Obviously, sodium incorporation indeed increases the grain size and improves the crystallinity of CZTSSe, which is in line with reports on GIGS40 and CZTSSe.43 The trend is also in good agreement with the full width half maximum (FWHM) and crystallite sizes calculated by using Scherrer's formula (Table S1†). However, discontinuous large grains and a large portion of fine grains are found in the Na-5 sample (Fig. 4(e)), which is similar to that of the Na-all sample (Fig. 2(d)), but exhibiting a higher density of large grains. This is due to the formation of excessive cracks in the precursor films (Fig. S6†). Overall, when the number of Na-containing layers surpasses 5, the cracks created by the deposition of Na-containing ink cannot be fully covered by coating the Na-free ink, thus lowering the quality of the absorbers.

The current transport properties of Na-0–Na-5 samples were studied by conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM) measurement, and the results are shown in Fig. 5. Previous studies demonstrated that GBs could help the separation of electron–hole pairs and accelerate carrier transportation in polycrystalline Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) and CZTSSe thin film solar cells.56,57 These GBs enhance the collection of minority carriers and provide a current pathway for minority carriers. Our C-AFM results also give a similar conclusion. According to the theoretical simulation, the formation energy of defects and defect clusters at the GBs is lower than that at the internal grains (IGs).39,57–60 Thus, the density of defects and/or defect clusters, especially the CuZn and ZnCu antisite defects, is higher at the GBs than that at the IGs.39,57–61 Those defects become the trap centers for charge carriers, thus reducing the mobility of carriers, as illustrated in Fig. S7.† What's more, it's reported that the high density of CuZn defects at the CZTSSe surface leads to Fermi level pinning, thereby reducing the VOC (ref. 62) and the efficiency of the device.

In our work, for the Na-0 sample, the current observed at GBs is below 1 nA, which enhances with the increase of the Na content. In general, it is known that the defects near GBs can be passivated by Na, as Na-related defects can form higher p-type conductivity regions rather than recombination centers.51 As previously mentioned, NaCu and NaZn are easily formed,53 and thus the incorporation of Na is beneficial to reduce the concentration of Cu–Zn antisite defects (CuZn and ZnCu), which results in a higher current than that of CZTSSe films without Na incorporation. Therefore, with the increasing of Na concentration, the detected current increases. Thus, Na incorporation can not only suppress the formation of unfavorable Cu–Zn antisite defects but also better the local charge transport. However, when the number of Na-containing layers is further increased to 5, the current decreases to 3 nA. This can be explained by the poor crystallinity of the Na-5 sample, which contains more fine grains and GBs, as confirmed by SEM results.

Fig. 6(a) shows the J–V characteristics of Na-1–Na-5 solar cells, and the corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that the PCE, FF, VOC, and JSC continuously rise when the number of Na-containing layers in the absorber increases up to 4, and a device with a PCE of 9.39% is obtained with a VOC, JSC, and FF of 0.480 V, 35.9 mA cm−2 and 54.0%, respectively. However, the PCE of the Na-5 based sample drops to 7.19%, due to the decline of JSC, VOC, and FF in comparison with that of the sample Na-4. The statistical analyses of the photovoltaic parameters are shown to evaluate the influence of the Na content on the device performance, as shown in Fig. 6(c–f). The average values of the four parameters rise from Na-1 to Na-4, followed by a drop in the Na-5 sample. Hence, the optimized number of Na-containing layers helps to enhance the device performance, while an excessive number of Na-containing layers deteriorates the device performance.

EQE curves (Fig. 6(b)) reveal that the intensity of the photoelectric response in medium and long wavelength ranges gradually increases from Na-0 to Na-4, which suggests a better collection capability of photo-generated carriers, and it could benefit from fewer defects in the CZTSSe bulk and the wider depletion region of the CZTSSe/CdS interface.63 As for the obvious decrease of photoelectric response intensity in Na-5, it can be correlated with the increased surface roughness of CZTSSe absorbers, which makes it difficult to deposit a homogeneous CdS buffer layer. This would lead to an inferior P–N junction and worsen the performance of the final device, as a high-quality CdS buffer layer is vital for the high performance of CZTSSe solar cells.12,64 The current densities estimated by integrating the area of the EQE curve are 27.5, 33.2, 35.2, 36.3, and 32.4 mA cm−2 for Na-1–Na-5 samples, respectively. These values are all slightly higher than that of the corresponding devices obtained from the J–V measurements. Besides, the bandgaps of CZTSSe thin films obtained with different Na-containing layers are estimated to be around 1.12 eV derived from the plots of dEQE versus dE.
The total area PCE of the Na-4 flexible device can be further improved to 9.63% with VOC, JSC, and FF of 0.483 V, 35.4 mA cm−2 and 56.2%, respectively, when the annealing temperature is elevated to 560 °C (Fig. 7(a)). And the integrated current density derived from EQE is 36.2 mA cm−2, which is slightly higher than that obtained from the J–V measurement, as shown in Fig. 7(b). Additionally, the statistical data of the device parameters are shown in Fig. 7(c). The average values of PCE, FF, JSC and VOC are 8.91%, 56.1%, 32.8 mA cm−2 and 486 mV, respectively. The improvement of the PCE in comparison with that of the sample annealed at 540 °C is mainly ascribed to the enhancement of FF. To get more insights, the key diode parameters of the solar cell are extracted using the single exponential diode equation.65 (1) (2)where Gsh, Rsh, Rs, A, and J0 are the shunt conduction, shunt resistance, series resistance, ideality factor, and reverse saturation current density, respectively, k is the Boltzmann constant, and q is the elementary charge on the electron. The fitting results are shown in Fig. 7(d–f). When the annealing temperature is elevated to 560 °C, Rs increases from 1.0 to 1.13 Ω cm2, and Rsh is enhanced from 212 to 232 Ω cm2, whereas A and J0 reduce from 3.36 to 2.64 and from 2.82 × 10−2 to 1.69 × 10−2 mA cm−2, respectively. The improvement of A, J0, and Rsh contributes to a better FF.10 What's more, the reduction of A reveals that the carrier recombination at the heterojunction interface is reduced. And the decrease of J0 and the increase of Rsh indicate the improvement of junction quality. Our 9.63% efficient device is a new record for flexible CZTSSe solar cells based on a non-hydrazine solution process reported so far.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate the fabrication of high-quality CZTSSe thin film absorbers on a flexible Mo foil substrates via scalable blade coating under ambient conditions. Na incorporation does help to enhance the performance of CZTSSe flexible solar cells. However, we find that a lot of cracks form in the precursor films when blading the Na-containing ink only, leading to inhomogeneous large grains growing along the cracks and limiting the further enhancement of device performance. An alternative coating process with Na-free and Na-containing inks is developed to successively address the issues of cracks in the precursor film and Na shortage when taking the Mo foil as the substrate. It's found that the incorporated Na reacts with Se to form NaxSe, which helps to enhance the crystallinity of CZTSSe films during the selenization process. Besides, the local charge transport is improved by passivating the deep-level defects at GBs. However, excessive Na-containing layers deteriorate the morphology of the resulting CZTSSe film and corresponding device performance. When the number of Na-containing layers is up to 4, the device achieves a total area PCE of 9.39% without the anti-reflection coating. The PCE is further improved to 9.63% by increasing the annealing temperature to 560 °C. This is the highest efficiency of flexible CZTSSe solar cells fabricated by all kinds of non-hydrazine solution processes. Our work demonstrates a high-throughput printing process for the fabrication of efficient flexible CZTSSe solar cells under ambient conditions, representing a significant step towards future flexible inorganic photovoltaics.

The CZTS precursor inks were prepared by dissolving Cu(NO3)2·5H2O, SnCl2·2H2O, Zn(CH3COO)2, and CH4N2S in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) mixed solvent (Cu/(Sn + Zn) = 0.66, Zn/Sn = 1.2, S/metals = 1.3, DMSO/DMF = 4, and the metal concentration is 2.82 M), which have been described in our previous work.46,47 Na3C6H5O7·2H2O was introduced into the as-mentioned inks with the atomic ratio of Na/(Cu + Zn + Sn) = 0.07. The molar concentration of Na in the Na-containing precursor ink is 0.2 M. The as-prepared ink was diluted with an equal volume of acetone to improve the wetting behavior of the solution on the Mo foil substrate.
The CZTS precursor films were deposited on Mo foil (5 cm × 5 cm) with a thickness of 0.1 mm via doctor-blading with an MS-ZN320 machine, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a). Before that, the Mo foil was firstly polished with diluted H2SO4 (10 vol% in H2O) for 10 min, and then cleaned in acetone, ethanol, and deionized water for 15 min in turns. The gap between the blade and the Mo foil was 0.25 mm. The coating speed was 70 cm min−1. The amount of ink was 1.2 μL cm−2 every time. After the coating process, the sample was placed on a hot plate at 320 °C for 2 min in air. The coating and drying steps were repeated eleven times to achieve an appropriate thickness of about 1.5 μm.
The CZTS precursor films were placed in a graphite box with mixed chalcogen powder containing 300 mg selenium and 6 mg sulfur.66 Afterwards, the graphite box was loaded into a rapid thermal processing furnace to complete the selenization process at 540 °C for 10 min with a N2 flow under ambient pressure. Then, the as-prepared absorbers were subjected to several etching processes to remove secondary phases and to passivate the surface by soaking the films into HCl (5 vol%, 75 °C, and 10 min) and (NH4)2S (20 wt% in H2O and 3 min) successively.67,68 The flexible CZTSSe thin film solar cells were assembled with a classical structure of Mo foil/CZTSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/ITO/Ag (Fig. 1(b)). The CdS buffer layer is prepared by chemical bath deposition according to our previous report.37 Specifically, 3.75 mL Cd(Ac)2 ammonium hydroxide solution at 0.017 mol L−1, 5 mL CH4N2S aqueous solution at 2.02 mol L−1 and 41.25 mL deionized water were mixed together in a beaker. The absorbers were placed in the above solution at 75 °C for 7 min to obtain a 50 nm CdS film. Subsequently, 50 nm i-ZnO and 200 nm ITO layers were deposited by radio frequency (RF) and direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering. In the end, silver grids were deposited by thermal evaporation with a shadow mask. The fabricated device was divided into nine isolated cells (0.36 cm2 for each cell) by mechanical scribing. No anti-reflection coating was applied for any of the devices.
Characterization
The structural information of the samples was analyzed by XRD (MiniFlex Rigaku) and Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw inVia reflex spectrometer, and lasers with wavelengths of 633 nm and 514 nm were used for excitation). The oxidation states of Cu, Zn, Sn, Na, and Se were measured by XPS (Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB 250). The micromorphology of the CZTSSe thin film was recorded by SEM (COXEM, EM-30AX), and the elemental information of the CZTSSe thin film was collected with an EDX Detector mounted on the SEM, whose scanning and signal processor models are micsF+ and x-stream-2, respectively. The current density–voltage (J–V) measurements for solar cells were carried out with a solar cell I–V Tester (Enlitech, SS-5F-3A) under standard AM 1.5 G (1000 W m−2) illumination at 298 K. The EQE values were obtained using a Q-Test Station 1000ADX system, calibrated with Si and Ge photodiodes (OSI-Optoelectronics). A Bruker Icon Dimension atomic force microscope (AFM) was used to identify the electrical characteristics of absorber films. And for current mapping, an extended tunneling atomic force microscopy (TUNA) module, Bruker AXS was used along with Pt-coated AFM tips. The current sensitivity of the amplifier was set to 10 nA V−1, and the samples were scanned at a bias of 1 V. The composition depth profiles were obtained by SIMS (ION TOF-SIMS 5), and a 30 keV Bi cluster primary ion gun was used for this analysis, along with O2+ ion guns for sputtering.
