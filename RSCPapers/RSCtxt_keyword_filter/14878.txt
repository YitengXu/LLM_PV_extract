    , Accepted 18th July 2022First published on 22nd July 2022AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown rapid progress in a decade of extensive research and development, aiming now towards commercialization. However, the development of more facile, reliable, and reproducible manufacturing techniques will be essential for industrial production. Many lamination methods have been initially designed for organic photovoltaics (OPVs), which are conceptually similar to PSCs. Lamination could provide a low-cost and adaptable technique for the roll-to-roll production of solar cells. This review presents an overview of lamination methods for the fabrication of PSCs and OPVs. The lamination of different electrodes consisting of various materials such as metal back contacts, photoactive layers, hole transport layers (HTLs), and electron transport layers (ETLs) is discussed. The efficiency and stability of the laminated devices are also presented. Finally, the challenges and opportunities of laminated solar cells are discussed.

1. Introduction
Extensive research on photovoltaic (PV) technologies has led to new low-cost, high-performance third-generation solar cells such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),1–6 quantum-dot solar cells (QDSCs),7 organic photovoltaics (OPVs),8–10 and perovskite solar cells (PSCs).11–18 However, most of these emerging technologies are still in the research phase and require more developments to reach commercial applications.19,20 Among third-generation solar cells, PSCs and OPVs could be turned into printable technologies as they have reached a suitable power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability.21–23 The PCE of PSCs has increased from 3.8% in 200924 to 25.7% in 2022,25,26 and in case of OPVs, it has developed from 2.5% in 200027 to 18.2% in 2022.28,29
Generally, PSCs are composed of the transparent conductive electrode (TCE) and/or transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass substrate, the electron transporting layer (ETL), perovskite film as the light absorber, the hole transporting layer (HTL), and the metal back contact.30–34 In the case of OPVs, the conventional structure includes the TCE glass substrate, HTL, light absorber consisting of a bilayer or mixture of p-type (an electron acceptor) and n-type materials (an electron donor), the buffer layer, and metal back contact.35,36 The ease of device fabrication for both PSCs and OPVs utilizing solution-processed methods such as spin-coating, slot-die coating, or inkjet printing is the key factor in their success.14,37–39 However, the deposition of a metal back contact in both kinds of solar cells is the most challenging part of device fabrication, which mainly needs a vacuum-based processing such as thermal evaporation or physical vapor deposition (PVD).40–43 Unfortunately, the metal can diffuse into the uncompleted solar cell, i.e., photoactive/HTL or ETL films, during these processes; this leads to shunting within the devices and thus performance losses.44 In addition, using expensive metals such as gold or silver could hamper commercialization.45,46 For example, although silver is cheaper than gold, unfortunately, it undergoes corrosion reactions with the photoactive layer and facilitates device degradation.47 Therefore, substituting the noble metal back contacts with inexpensive and inert materials is an important direction to decrease fabrication costs and improve device stability.14,48 In this regard, low-cost carbon materials with low reactivity have been introduced as promising candidates for this purpose in both PSCs and OPVs.49–52
Furthermore, lamination methods have been introduced as a low-cost alternative approach for stacking the pre-deposited metal back contact electrode onto photoanode electrodes in PSCs.53 Besides, laminated PSCs render the merits of self-encapsulation and stability enhancement. Moreover, this method possesses high operational capability through the parallel preparation of the top and bottom layers, adopting the conventional layer-by-layer deposition methods.54–57 Initially, the lamination method was used to implement carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as a bifunctional hole transporter and back contact layer onto the PSC configuration.58 For a favored back contact in PSC architecture, one should consider the energy/Fermi levels alignment, work function in the −4.1 to −5.1 eV range, electrical conductivity, and stability of the fabricated electrodes. Later, this method was applied for different parts of device architectures, including stacking the perovskite/perovskite interface on separate substrates,54,59 or wet pre-deposited HTL/perovskite interface, i.e., sandwich structure.56,57,60 The hot-pressing of the transparent conductive adhesive (TCA) to stick the top electrode into the pre-fabricated ETL/perovskite/HTL stack was also adopted as a premier lamination method.61,62 Moreover, the mechanical lamination of two half-stacks using a vacuum hot embossing machine63,64 or a double clip65 was performed to fabricate both rigid and flexible PSCs. However, one of the most dominant challenges in using this method for PSC fabrication is the sensitivity of organic–inorganic perovskite films to high temperatures and pressures due to the volatile components and the soft nature of perovskite films.66–69
The lamination methods also have been used for stacking different parts of the OPV devices, including polymeric top electrodes using an adhesive,70–72 the photoactive polymer layer,73,74 or anode and cathode half stacks.75,76 Likewise, laminated-OPVs employ similar strategies as laminated-PSCs regarding the substrate, equipment, and processes.71,77–79 Notwithstanding, the main differences between lamination methods in PSCs and OPVs are in the involved materials, solution options, and drying steps due to the sensitivity of perovskite films to polar solvents.
This review focuses on stacking different layers via various lamination methods to fabricate highly efficient and stable solar cells. The lamination of numerous layers such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxitiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), carbon materials, and metals as top or bottom contacts for fabricating PSCs or OPVs are discussed. The advantages and challenges of each different laminated electrode and their effects on the fabricated devices are discussed. Scheme 1 presents the overall concept of the dry transfer of various electrodes in the lamination processes, which will be addressed in this review.

2. Laminated perovskite solar cells (PSCs)
A majority of applied lamination methods for PSC fabrication have focused on the dry transfer of the electrodes.77,78,80–84 In this method, the target film is first deposited onto the transfer medium and then laminated onto another stack to complete the device.66,85,86 This target film could only be the charge transporting layers (CTLs) and/or both CTLs and back electrodes together, or CTLs and active layers.49,87,88 Herein, we classified the laminated PSCs into two categories according to the prominent CTLs (HTLs in n–i–p structure or ETLs in p–i–n structure) to provide a more comprehensive view of the lamination methods on the electrode–CTL interface and their photovoltaic performance. However, it should be considered that the perovskite film is severely vulnerable to the lamination parameters such as the applied pressure, temperature, and the solvents/additives of electronic glue (e-glue).66,89,90
2.1. PEDOT:PSS for PSCs
PEDOT:PSS has emerged as one of the promising hole-transporting materials (HTM) for solar cell application [135]. The high-conductivity of 1000 S cm−1 with appropriate work function (∼5.0 eV) as well as high transparency and flexibility enable PEDOT:PSS to be used in PSCs as CTL and suitable back contact simultaneously.91,92 However, typically, the PEDOT:PSS solution involves an aqueous or a polar solvent, which has a significantly destructive effect on the perovskite stability.93,94 Therefore, it is crucial to develop convenient tailoring methods for the deposition or transfer of PEDOT:PSS on perovskite films.95,96 Laminating a pre-deposited PEDOT:PSS electrode onto the perovskite films has been introduced as an efficient method to overcome this challenge. However, to enable the direct stacking of the PEDOT:PSS electrode by the lamination method, the appropriate binders are necessary to improve its mechanical strength, flexibility, and stretchability. In this regard, D-sorbitol has been broadly utilized as a cost-effective and biocompatible binder and dopant for optoelectronic applications.53,97–99 In the initial architectures of laminated PSCs, the PEDOT:PSS layer was occasionally employed as HTL with D-sorbitol as the e-glue to stick the two stacks together.62,77,100 In one case, the device structure of FTO glass/TiO2/Al2O3/perovskite/SpiroOMeTAD/PEDOT:PSS/Ni Mesh/PET/Embedded grid was used.100 The champion laminated cell showed a PCE of 15.5%, which was comparable to that of the fabricated device with conventional Au contact (16.7%). The achieved lower PCE might be due to imperfect electrical contact between Spiro-OMeTAD and PEDOT:PSS layers in the laminated device.
Similarly, Troughton et al. fabricated flexible PSCs on the Ti foil as the primary substrate by laminating the PET film embedded in a Ni grid/conductive adhesive as a cathode onto the Spiro-OMeTAD/PEDOT:PSS layer as the HTL (Fig. 1a).101 First, a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS was spray-coated onto the Spiro-OMeTAD as an interlayer, which acts as an HTL-to-TCA contact promoter. On the other side, the mixture of pressure-sensitive adhesive and PEDOT:PSS was blade-coated onto a PET film embedded in an Ni grid. Then, this stack was laminated onto another stack of Ti foil/TiO2/Al2O3/MAPbI3−xClx/Spiro-OMeTAD/PEDOT:PSS. The thicknesses of the PEDOT:PSS interlayer is very critical for achieving the highest photovoltaic parameters. They demonstrated that using a 22 nm PEDOT:PSS interlayer leads to the best Jsc and FF for laminated PSC. In contrast, the higher thicknesses of this interlayer lead to faster device degradation due to the destruction of the HTL and TCA contact due to the higher water content. The PCEs of 10.3% and 12.7% were achieved for the Ti foil- and FTO glass-based devices with optimum PEDOT:PSS interlayer thickness.

In addition, Ag-NWs/TCA (PEDOT:PSS/D-sorbitol) has been used as a composited back contact electrode, which shows comparable charge transport and recombination resistances to the evaporated Ag electrode.71 This electrode was used to fabricate perovskite and organic solar modules by the lamination method (Fig. 1b). Also, it was revealed that a thin layer of polyethyleneimine (PEI) on the top of ZnO nanoparticles could improve the electrical contact with the TCA in the interface of two stacks. As a result, the PCEs of 5.3% and 9.8% for organic and perovskite modules were achieved, respectively.
Furthermore, the effect of the sorbitol content in the Ag network/TCA (PEDOT:PSS/D-sorbitol) transparent electrode on the performance of laminated flexible PSCs has been evaluated.62 With 400 mg sorbitol in 1 mL PEDOT:PSS dispersion, average performances of 6.7% and 8.8% were achieved for the abovementioned laminated electrode and FTO glass, respectively. However, a higher average PCE of 10.1% was obtained for the PSC with the Au-evaporated electrode, which might be related to the light reflection of the Au layer. Likewise, Jiang et al. fabricated the PSCs employing transfer-medium PEDOT:PSS PH1000 as the conducting polymer electrodes.77 Firstly, they prepared TiO2/MAPbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD stacking on the FTO glass. Then, the back contact consisting of dried PEDOT:PSS/PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) film was laminated upon the first stack at 90 °C, leading to a PCE of 10.9% for the final fabricated OPV device. It should be taken into account that there are several challenges in using PDMS for this purpose, including the requirements of plasma/UV-ozone treatments to enhance the film wettability before the PEDOT:PSS deposition, expensive curing agents, taking too much time for polymerization, and limitations for large-scale production. These challenges convinced researchers to substitute the PDMS transfer medium with plastic wrap.102 In this case, Bu et al. prepared the PEDOT:PSS electrode on the plastic wrap for laminating atop the perovskite film.78,84 A PCE of 10.1% was achieved for the semitransparent PSC device with optimized mesoporous TiO2. Furthermore, using this method, the fabricated large-area semi-transparent PSC leads to a PCE of 2.9%, which could be enhanced up to 6.7% by soldering electrical wires to reduce the series resistance.
The PSS in the PEDOT:PSS structure is the poor conductive part of this polymer.103 Therefore, PEDOT:PSS was treated with a mild HNO3 solution to improve the performance of laminated PSCs.104 The highly conductive e-glue (conductive adhesives) was inserted onto the stack to complete the device by a small pressure and annealing at 60 °C for 5 min, leading to enhanced Voc and Jsc from 0.81 V and 14.3 mA cm−2 to 1.059 V and 22.7 mA cm−2, respectively.
Dry stamping transfer has also been introduced as a suitable method for the lamination of the PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) thin film as a flexible top electrode onto the perovskite film to avoid subsequent degradation.91,102,105 In this regard, Lee et al. developed a poly(urethane acrylate) (PUA) stamp to deposit the PEDOT:PSS flexible transparent electrode on the perovskite film directly.106 First, PEDOT:PSS was coated on a PUA/Polycarbonate stamp, followed by drying. Second, a thin poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) layer was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS film to modify its work function. The prepared top electrode was laminated onto the PCBM/FAPbI3−xBrx/PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrate at 100 °C using a roller, and then the PUA/Polycarbonate film was detached (Fig. 1c). Therein, reproducible semi-transparent highly-flexible PSCs with over 13% PCE were obtained.
Laminating two different half-stacks perovskite films is another approach for the fabrication of PSCs: Dunfield et al. fabricated two half-stacks of the TCO/SnOx/perovskite and TCO/NiOx/perovskite by the solution-processed method separately.54 As shown in Fig. 2a, the PSC was completed by laminating them together at 150 °C under 300 psi (=2.06 MPa) pressure, leading to a PCE of 10.6%. Nevertheless, the low average PCE of 9.6% for these devices was mainly attributed to the higher series resistance (Rs = 59 Ω), which caused resistive losses through the wide TCO on each side.

Inspired by the DSSCs sandwich device structure, the two TCO electrodes can be used as front and back electrodes to fabricate the PSC with self-encapsulation features to protect the devices from moisture and improve the device stability.56,107–109 Using this architecture, Heo et al. fabricated semi-transparent planar sandwich PSCs with almost a hysteresis-free PCE of 15.8% and over 20 days of stability (5% dropped PCE) without any extra encapsulation.56 They used semi-transparent FTO glass/TiO2/MAPbI3/HTL and ITO/PEDOT:PSS as the first and second stack, respectively. These two stacks were pressurized by a double clip and then dried to complete the device structure. To improve the physical contact between the two stacks, a drop of HTL (P3HT or PTAA) was cast onto the perovskite films before the lamination process (Fig. 2b). The average PCEs of 12.8% and 15.8% was achieved for fabricated PSCs with P3HT and PTAA as the HTLs, respectively.
Dunlap-Shohl et al. explored the behavior of the perovskite film and other layers under severe lamination conditions, i.e., high pressure and temperature.90 Therein, they applied a rapid lamination method to complete the device in 5 minutes. Based on the XRD studies, they demonstrated that applying pressure during the MAPbI3 annealing could help the layers to endure high temperatures in the lamination process. The Spiro-OMeTAD/D-sorbitol/PEDOT:PSS/ITO stack was glued to the ITO/SnO2/PCBM/MAPbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD stack at 120 °C and 500 psi (=3.44 MPa) pressure to produce a bifacial PSC, achieving a PCE up to 12% (Fig. 2c). Recently, the same research group further boosted the performance and stability of the laminated bifacial PSCs using albedo light in the bifacial structure of PSCs and optimizing the HTL thickness.110 Similarly, the first stack of glass/ITO/SnO2/MAPbI3/undoped Spiro-OMeTAD and the second stack of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/D-sorbitol were pressed at 100 °C and 2000 psi (=13.8 MPa). The optimization of functional additive (FN-Br (3,3′-(2,7-dibromo-9H-fluorene-9,9-diyl)bis(N,N-dimethylpropane-1-amine))) concentration in the HTL solution adjusted the Fermi level of Spiro-OMeTAD, leading to improved Voc and FF from 0.98 to 1.08 V and from 0.65 to 0.75, respectively. As a result, a PCE of 15% with 0.93 bifaciality was achieved for rapid laminated PSC in one minute, as well as acceptable stability by maintaining 75% of the original PCE under continuous illumination at 50% RH for 100 h.
In the case of PEDOT:PSS lamination, laminating the PEDOT:PSS film in the p–i–n device is not very common. Since its aqueous dispersion could be deposited by conventional coating methods and annealed as HTLs before the perovskite layer, it is not destructive to the overall performance of the PSC devices.
In an overall view, the utilization of PEDOT:PSS in laminated semitransparent PSCs has been described. These methods could be used to fabricate large-area, high-efficiency, and low-cost semitransparent PSCs with high stability. They mainly involve manufacturing an e-glue or TCA to stick the two prepared half-stacks (one of them includes PEDOT:PSS) and highly conductive composites with metal grids to be directly transferred onto the HTL via transfer media. The applied pressure plays a key role in the lamination process. The higher pressure ensures a perfect contact interface between the perovskite and the dry-transferred top layers and reduces detachment, improving the charge transfer and performance of the devices. However, monitoring the inserted pressure is necessary to find the optimized value. As yet, the highest PCE was reported to be 15.77% for laminated planar PSCs with a bifacial (sandwiched) configuration using PEDOT:PSS as a highly conductive adhesive layer to stick the top ITO.110
2.2. Carbon materials for PSCs
So far, various carbonaceous materials with different morphologies such as carbon black, graphite, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and graphene have been used for PSCs due to many advantages such as low cost, hydrophobicity, high conductivity, flexibility, chemically inert nature, and appropriate work functions.111,112 Moreover, unlike conventional metal back contacts, carbon materials possess a relatively high specific surface area with suitable energy level, making them applicable as HTL and/or back contact films in PSCs.113–116 The interface compatibility between the carbon and the perovskite films is crucial, especially for the HTL-free carbon-based PSCs. For instance, the layered and foliated nature of graphite tends to create a spatial distance from the perovskite film. This challenge could be tackled through solvent or additive engineering to achieve an ideal carbon/perovskite interface.117,118 However, inducing the HTL in carbon-based PSC architectures reduces hole recombination at this interface. Besides, the sheet resistance of the carbon electrodes also affects the performance of the PSCs by reducing the Voc and FF parameters.53,119
The carbon pastes could be prepared by adding a suitable binder to carbon nanomaterials, followed by a sonication or homogenizer process. This carbon paste could be deposited on a substrate to produce a nanocarbon-binder film. After that, this carbon film undergoes either of the two changes to produce free-standing or self-standing carbon films. In the first approach, the solvent-exchange process, the carbon film is immersed in an appropriate solvent, i.e., ethanol, to exchange the solvent medium, followed by drying in ambient air and finally peeled off from the substrate.120,121 In the second approach, the carbon film is annealed/dried, usually on a hot plate, to evaporate the solvent and then peeled off the substrate.
The solvent-exchange process in carbon paste has been introduced by Zhang et al. to avoid damaging the perovskite film during the fabrication of PSCs, producing two kinds of blade-coated carbon electrode films with different qualities (see Fig. 3a).122 The press transfer during the lamination process caused decreasing sheet resistance of the carbon film from 424 to 58 Ω sq−1. As a result, the laminated carbon-based PSC devices showed 19.2% PCE, whereas blade-coated carbon-based PSCs demonstrated a PCE of 15.2%.

The hot-pressing of the free-standing carbon films for the fabrication of the carbon-based PSCs was reported by Yang et al.123 They used this method for a triple cation-based PSC planar structure with CuSCN/Spiro-OMeTAD as the HTLs. They benefited from the solvent-removing of carbon paste through the immersion of the film in ethanol,122 followed by N2-drying, peeling off the carbon film from the substrate, and pressing the carbon electrode directly onto the HTL. The sheet resistance and morphology of the prepared carbon films and the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs were studied by applying different temperature ranges of 22 °C, 40 °C, 60 °C, and 80 °C at a constant pressure insertion of 30 MPa for 3 min. It was demonstrated that the temperature increase leads to lower average Rs (13.78 ± 1.03 Ω) and lower hysteresis index (0.007 ± 0.010), as well as a higher average Voc (1.08 ± 0.01 V), Jsc (20.2 ± 0.5 mA cm−1), FF (66.5 ± 1.0%), and thus PCE (14.5 ± 0.4%) of the fabricated PSCs. The champion PCE of 15.3% retained 93% of its initial amount after 80 days under 70% RH.
The effect of ethanol solvent interlacing time from the carbon paste in the solvent-exchange process on the carbon film properties and thus ultimate C-based PSC performance has recently been studied by Passatorntaschakorn et al.124 They demonstrated that the excess binder containing CO functional group in the carbon films could be effectively removed after 2 h of immersing carbon films in the ethanol, resulting in a more uniform and conductive electrode. The improved charge transfers between carbon and Spiro-OMeTAD layer lead to a PCE of 12.2% for the laminated PSC.
The performance of free-standing hybrid graphene/dry-spun CNT films as multifunctional electrodes for laminated PSCs has also been examined.118 First, the double-layer graphene/Cu stacked layer was prepared, and then the CNT was coated via the dry-spinning method.125 After that, Cu was etched to obtain a hybrid graphene/graphene/CNT free-standing film. This film was scooped by a PTFE transfer medium and transferred onto the FTO/TiO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD stack utilizing a roller. The hybrid graphene (4-layers)/CNT (8-layers) film demonstrated the best conductivity and performance, leading to a PCE of 15.3% with 86% retention of the initial value after 500 h at 50% RH without encapsulation.
Very recently, a conductive cloth composed of polyester woven fabric with Ni/Cu coatings on yarn was employed as a support substrate by Peng et al.126 They used a similar solvent-exchange process for carbon film. As shown in Fig. 3b, after the blade-coating of carbon paste on the conductive cloth, the peeled-off wet composite film was soaked in ethanol for the solvent-exchange process. The mesh structure of the carbon/conductive cloth composite promotes the diffusion of the ethanol molecules into this layer and facilitates ethanol evaporation afterward. The resulting composite carbon electrode was applied to fabricate both rigid and flexible PSCs. Also, this film was compared to other obtained carbon films such as bare self-adhesive carbon film, carbon/graphite paper film, and carbon/aluminum foil. As a result, the fabricated PSCs with carbon/conductive cloth film demonstrated low resistance with high flexibility, achieving remarkable PCEs of 19.36%, 15.37%, and 14.05% for rigid, small-area flexible (0.1 cm2), and large-area flexible (1 cm2) substrates, respectively.
As another method, FTO glass was placed at a constant distance of 2 cm above a burning candle to collect the soot at different times of 10, 15, and 20 s.127 The material characterization analyses confirmed the graphite carbon nature of the formed film. The resulting spongy carbon film on the FTO substrate was pressed on the Spiro-OMeTAD layer as the back contact to complete the PSC device, leading to a maximum PCE of 4.24%.
Coal-based carbon (Coal-C) electrode has also been introduced for low-cost laminated HTL-free PSCs.128 In this approach, Coal-C powder, acetylene black, and PVAc were mixed in chlorobenzene, and then the mixture was blade-coated on an Al foil substrate (Fig. 3c). On the other side, the second carbon paste was sprayed on the perovskite film, followed by an annealing process to achieve the FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite/carbon second stack. The first carbon film was hot-pressed on the second stack at 85 °C under 0.4 MPa pressure for 50 s. The fabricated PSC with 20 mg mL−1 acetylene black paste showed the lowest series resistance (Rs) of 3.73 Ω, achieving a PCE of 10.87%.
Wei et al. prepared different ratios of graphite flake and carbon black powder in polyvinyl acetate to optimize the carbon paste.129 After making the carbon paste with an optimal weight ratio of 3:1 for graphite:carbon black powder by a low-temperature and straightforward process, the carbon film was fabricated using a blade-coating method on a Teflon film/Al foil, followed by drying and peeling off. Thereafter, this carbon film was directly hot-pressed at various pressures of 0.15, 0.25, and 0.40 MPa onto the perovskite film, reaching a PCE of 13.53% for the optimal pressure of 0.25 MPa. Moreover, this carbon-based PSC showed only a 5% PCE drop (from 13.53% to 12.87%) after 20 days under ambient conditions, while the Au-based PSC showed a 21% PCE drop (from 10.69% to 8.55%) under the same conditions.
As the first study on graphene, You et al. laminated multi-layer graphene as the top electrode onto the perovskite/HTL film to fabricate PSCs.130 The multi-layer graphene was synthesized on a copper foil by the CVD method and was then transferred onto the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)/PDMS film as the transfer medium. Then, this PDMS/PMMA/graphene stack was peeled-off and laminated onto the FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx/Spiro-OMeTAD/PEDOT:PSS stack to complete the PSC. Besides, for improving the conductivity and transmittance of the graphene film, a thin film of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on the graphene surface, which reduced the sheet resistance of two-layer graphene to 140 ± 35 Ω sq−1 and reached up to 90% transmittance. Consequently, the maximum PCEs of 12.02% and 11.65% were achieved for semitransparent PSCs with FTO and graphene illumination sides, respectively.130
As mentioned in the previous section, CNTs are desirable for photovoltaics electrodes since they can provide the R2R deposition process due to their flexibility and semitransparency properties.131,132 Firstly, Aitola et al. used single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films for PSCs fabrication using the press-transfer lamination method.133 First, a filter coated with SWCNT film was pressed onto the perovskite film. Then, the filter was peeled-off, and chlorobenzene was dropped onto the film to densify it. Another layer of SWCNT was laminated on top of the previous layer to decrease the sheet resistance, leading to reduced resistance from 43 to 13 Ω sq−1. The hole transport contact was finalized by drop-casting the Spiro-OMeTAD solution onto the resultant SWCNT film. As a result, the laminated PSC with SWCNT back contact showed a PCE of 16%, comparable to Au back contact-based PSC with a PCE of 18%. Interestingly, the SWCNT-based PSCs showed high-temperature stability at 60 °C under an N2 atmosphere over 580 h with slight efficiency loss, while the Au-based PSCs showed only 140 h stability under the same conditions. Recently, Zhang et al. explored the effects of HNO3 treatment on the CuNiOx-doped SWCNTs layer. They used a simple dry-transfer method to laminate the resulting SWCNT films on both rigid and flexible substrates and fabricate inverted PSCs.134 The fabricated PSCs with HNO3-treated Cu:NiOx-doped SWCNT showed champion PCEs of 19.0% and 18.0% on rigid and flexible substrates, respectively. Moreover, the SWCNT-based flexible PSC could retain 85% of its initial PCEs after bending 1000 times at a 6 mm radius (Fig. 3d).
In summary, free-standing carbon films from carbon pastes, CNTs, and graphene sheets applied in dry-transfer lamination could meet the PSCs R2R production requirements, including low costs, good interfacial contacts, high efficiency, and stability. In terms of the performance, the highest reported PCE of PSCs based on laminated carbon films onto the HTL as the top contact reached 19.2% in 2019122 and 19.36% in 2021.126 For the laminated SWCNT films as the bottom contact in the inverted PSC structure, 19.0% PCE was achieved.134
2.3. Metal back contacts for PSCs
The low electrical resistance of metal nanostructures such as silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) and silver nanowires (Ag NWs) make them suitable as back contact materials for PSCs.135–137 However, the Ag NPs inks require sintering at high temperatures to provide better conductivity, which most of the time leads to silver diffusing into the layers beneath and subsequently damaging the perovskite structure.138–140 To address this challenge, Trinh et al. spin-coated the Ag NPs ink onto a PET substrate and annealing, followed by spin-coating the PEDOT:PSS/D-sorbitol solution on top as the first stack. Then, they laminated the first stack onto the second stack consisting of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-MeOTAD layers at 120 °C for 10 min, followed by finger pressure pressing to complete the device.141 The laminated PSCs therein attained an average PCE of 10.03%, which was close to the thermally-evaporated Ag electrode-based device with 11.9% PCE. Very recently, the Ag NWs top electrode was laminated using PEI as a sticky glue with several advantages such as good adhesion, surface modification of the electrode, and protective coating, which suppressed the chemical reaction between silver and the perovskite film (Fig. 4a).142 First, the Ag NWs network was sprayed on the glass substrate coated by the self-assembly octadecyl trichlorosilane (OTS) monolayer with low surface energy (donor). Then, the prepared electrode, i.e., glass/OTS/Ag NWs/PEI, was laminated onto the ITO/PEDOT/perovskite/PCBM stack by cold isostatic pressing at 8 MPa for 10 min, leading to a PCE of 12%.

In a versatile lamination method, Schmager et al. reported the hot-pressing lamination of two half-stacks consisting of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PTAA and PEN foil/evaporated Au/sputtered NiOx HTL, respectively.63 The lamination was performed in the pressure and temperature ranges from 0 to 200 kN and 60 to 105 °C, respectively. The critical point in their lamination strategy was a thin PTAA buffer layer at the perovskite/NiOx interface, which improved the mechanical and electrical contact by filling the remaining holes at the interface. Hence, PTAA-based PSC showed a higher FF of 70%, a lower Rs of 60 Ω, and a higher PCE of 14.6% compared to the devices without the PTAA buffer layer with an FF of 60%, an Rs of 180 Ω, and a PCE of 13.2%. The self-encapsulated architecture of the presented lamination method also blocked oxygen and moisture, leading to enhanced stability. The structures based on rigid semi-transparent, opaque flexible, and semi-transparent flexible PSCs showed PCEs of 11.5%, 11.3%, and 8.8%, respectively. This method could be adaptable for tandem or module applications.
The application of economic and commercial conductive tapes (C-tapes) consisting of Cu foil support and conductive acrylic adhesive with embedded micrometer-size Ni particles as the top electrode in the inverted PSCs was reported by Shao et al.143 (Fig. 4b). They demonstrated that applying 980 Pa pressure on the C-tape during the lamination process is necessary to achieve desirable contact with the underlayer, achieving a champion PCE of 12.7%. In terms of stability, the PCE of the laminated device dropped from 12.3% to only 11.0% after ten days under ambient conditions, while the non-laminated counterpart dropped severely from 14.6% to 3.4%, demonstrating the capability of C-tapes for impeding moisture and humidity from entering the device.
Low-cost transparent electrode based on PET/Cu Grid:PH1000 was fabricated by forming the Cu honeycombs structure on a photoresist film and lifting it off to leave the Cu as bottom contact in inverted flexible PSCs.144 They could acquire 13.58% PCE and 90% stability with more than 1000 bending cycles of 5 mm curvature.
Recently, Li et al. developed a solvent and vacuum-free press-transferring of Au back-contact to fabricate PSCs.85 In this case, 80 nm Au was evaporated on the PTFE films to achieve the Au/PTFE film. Then, as schematically shown in Fig. 4c, the Au/PTFE stack pressed by a glass rod onto another stack consisted of FTO glass/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD, followed by the peeling off the PTFE film to complete the PSC. Therein, PCEs of 17.4% and 19.2% were achieved for the Au-laminated Au thermally-evaporated PSCs, respectively. They mentioned that the lower PCE for the laminated device might be due to higher sheet resistance, insufficient coverage of the Au film, and random microcracks in Au-transfer.
Overall, the laminated metal back contacts in PSCs mainly involved the press-transferring of Ag NWs, commercial Cu adhesives, and Au films with convenient transfer media. Moreover, these high-conductive materials could be combined with other materials to produce composite electrodes for lamination usages, as shown in previous sections. The highest PCEs of 17.4% and 12.5% were obtained for n–i–p and p–i–n metal contact-laminated PSCs, respectively.85,143

3. Laminated organic photovoltaics (OPVs)
Similar to PSCs, traditional solutions or vacuum evaporation-assisted methods are still very popular for depositing different layers in OPVs.99,146 However, besides the high fabrication costs of these methods, diffusing different materials into the underneath organic layers and damaging the organic layers lead to low PCEs and stabilities. Therefore, it is quite necessary to introduce better device fabrication methods that are more compatible with scalable R2R processes.90,91,139–143 The lamination of pre-deposited layers on different stacks has been introduced as a promising method to fabricate highly efficient and stable OPVs. Similar to the PSCs section, here, we classified the laminated OPVs based on laminating charge-transporting layers (CTLs) and/or both CTLs and back contact electrodes.
3.1. PEDOT:PSS for OPVs
The PEDOT:PSS has been introduced as the most widespread polymeric alternative back contact for ITO-free and/or metal-free OPVs.102,147 Firstly, Huang et al.72 studied the lamination of flexible electrodes to fabricate semitransparent OPVs. They laminated the PEDOT:PSS (PH1000):D-sorbitol (E-glue) film onto the active organic layer at the optimized temperature of 110 °C for 10–15 minutes, leading to a PCE of 3%. Similarly, Yuan et al.148 coated the PEDOT:PSS:D-sorbitol as an e-glue on the PEN/Ag substrate, followed by lamination onto the ITO/CsCo3/P3HT:PCBM stack at 100 °C and 10–50 KPa. The laminated device showed a PCE of 4.0%, comparable to the achieved PCE of 3.6% for regular inverted OPV with MoO3/Ag anode.
Besides, the nanoparticle (NP) interlayer for the lamination of OPVs has been introduced to achieve desired electrical and mechanical contact.72,75,149 For example, Lu et al. implemented insulating barium titanate (BaTiO3) NPs into the active layer solution as a spacer to improve the mechanical stability of the inverted OPVs.150 In this case, the laminated flexible OPVs with BaTiO3 NPs presented a PCE of 3.79% with high endurance and stability under high pressure and large bending curvature. Although a similar PCE of 3.81% was achieved for the device without the NPs, however, with a severe current leakage under pressure and bending of more than 40°.
The dry stamp transfer lamination has been introduced as a more promising method compared to glue-based lamination for the fabrication of OPVs, which solve the wettability challenge of the PEDOT:PSS film during the device fabrication.80,151–153 In this approach, the e-glue (mainly consisting of PEDOT:PSS with D-sorbitol) was spin-coated on an elastomeric stamp directly, followed by lamination under pressure onto another half stack at a specific temperature, resulting in the transfer of the PDEOT:PSS layer onto the device.151–153 As an example of this method, Gupta et al. deposited PEDOT:PSS directly onto plasma-treated PDMS as the stamp, followed by lamination onto the rest of the device stack and annealed at 80–90 °C for 2 min. After cooling down the substrate, the PDMS was mechanically peeled-off. Nevertheless, to enhance the conductivity and reduce the sheet resistance of PH1000, 100 nm thick Ag lines were evaporated on it as the busbars through the shadow mask (Fig. 5a, type A and B). As a result, the laminated OPVs in n–i–p and p–i–n configurations showed PCEs of 3.25% and 2.12%, respectively.

Although the fabrication of flexible OPVs by the lamination method is challenging due to flexible substrate electrodes for both top and bottom contacts, they presented significant performances compared to rigid TCO contacts counterparts.75,102,154 For example, Zhou et al. fabricated recyclable flexible OPVs based on cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) substrates with the CNC/Ag/PEI/P3HT:ICBA/PH1000 device configuration.153 Similarly, the PEDOT:PSS PH1000 was deposited on the PDMS transfer medium. On the other side, the surface of the photoactive layer (P3HT:ICBA) was exposed to flash-instant O2/plasma to become more hydrophilic, resulting in easier PEDOT:PSS transfer without further thermal annealing or air drying. The resulting laminated-PSC achieved an average PCE of 3.8%, significantly higher than that of the reported solar cells on CNC substrates with Ag electrode (PCE of 2.7%).153,154
Thermoplastic polymers such as PDMS and PET are extensively employed as transfer media in lamination methods.77,153,155–157 To tackle the wettability problems of PDMS, an inexpensive plastic wrap was introduced as the alternative medium to transfer PEDOT:PSS as the top electrode for OPVs.78,158 PEDOT:PSS-PH1000 coated on a plastic wrap could be easily transferred onto another stack without further wettability treatments, leading to the achievement of higher PCE of 4.0% compared to PCE of 3.5% for fabricated OPVs with PDMS.78
Utilizing PEDOT:PSS as the top electrode of organic tandem solar cells via the film-transfer lamination method was firstly reported by Tong et al.159 They fabricated laminated tandem OPVs based on P3HT:ICBA as the active layer for both bottom and top cells with the stacked structure of glass/ITO/PEI/P3HT:ICBA/PH1000/PEI/P3HT:ICBA/PEDOT-T. After transferring the PEDOT:PSS/PDMS top electrode, the PDMS was peeled off from the laminated device. The tandem device showed a significant Voc of 1.6 V, which is approximately the summation of the two individual sub-cells. PCEs of 2.5%, 3.0%, and 3.4% were obtained for the bottom and top sub-cells and the tandem structure, respectively. Also, the application of various lamination methods in tandem/ternary semitransparent OPVs with the polymer:dye:fullerene architecture has been reported by Makha et al. (Fig. 5c and d).160 They coated PEDOT:PSS/D-sorbitol onto a flexible and transparent top electrode comprised of a PET/Ag mesh structure. The transparent top electrode was laminated onto the pre-fabricated cell stack at 120 °C by applying finger pressure. The laminated OPV with a 5 nm MoO3 interlayer showed a PCE of 3.0%.
The solvent treatment method is proposed as an effective regular method to enhance the PEDOT:PSS layer conductivity.161,162 However, this method suffers from challenges relating to the chemical and physical reactions of the substrates with strong acids (i.e., H3PO4 and H2SO4),161 raising the difficulty of washing the acid from the PEDOT:PSS matrix.
Therefore, Fan et al. developed a less destructive transfer-printing technology by employing a two-step sequential mild acid treatment including methanesulfonic acid (CH4SO3) dipping treatment and phosphoric acid (H3PO4) soaking treatment,163 leading to enhanced conductivity of the flexible transparent electrode up to 3500 S cm−1. The laminated flexible OPVs with the PEDOT:PSS/PEDOT:PSS (4083)/PBDTT-S-TT:PC71BM/Ca/Al structure achieved PCEs of 5.38% and 4.8% for the mild acid-treated (CH4SO3 and H3PO4) and H2SO4-treated electrodes, respectively.
Briefly, highly conductive PEDOT:PSS PH1000 (mainly with D-sorbitol) has been utilized in a majority of laminated OPVs. They were used in lamination methods with an e-glue to stick the top contact onto the device, as an electrode itself, or as a composite electrode being directly transferred onto the whole device stack using a transfer medium (mainly PDMS). In terms of performance, the highest PCEs reported for laminated OPVs using PH1000 as an e-glue and as a transfer-pressed electrode were 5.33% and 6.42%, respectively.71,163
3.2. Carbon materials for OPVs
As mentioned in the PSCs section, carbon materials, including SWCNTs, multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT), graphene, and graphene oxide (GO), have been considered as the most promising alternative bottom and top electrode candidates in OPVs as well.81,164–167
In this regard, Kim et al. transferred a transparent free-standing MWCNT (f-MWCNT) top electrode onto the n–i–p OPV device structure using a solution-assisted self-laminating process.168 The as-prepared f-MWCNT sheets were manually deposited on top of the organic stacks, followed by immersion into an orthogonal liquid hydrofluoroether (HFE) solution to enhance the transparency and conductivity. As a result, PCEs of 1.5% and 0.9% for the bottom and top illumination were achieved, respectively. Also, the laminated f-MWCNT-based devices showed superior stability with PCE decay of only 3% after 700 h, while the device with Ag back contact showed 6% decay.
In a study of laminating CNTs, two transferring methods for the lamination of SWCNTs electrodes on top of OPVs were proposed, and two p-type dopants were also used as SWCNTs modifiers.167 In the first method, SWCNT film was coated on the glass substrate, then doped with HNO3 by drop-casting, and finally pressed onto the active layer using a UV resin as a transfer medium. In the second method, the SWCNT film was fixed on a metal holder, doped with MoOx by thermal evaporation, and pressed onto the active layer.167 The fabricated OPVs with two different lamination methods of HNO3 and MoOx-doped-SWCNTs exhibited PCEs of 3.7% and 3.1%, respectively. It was also implied that higher PCE up to 4.1% could be obtained with thicker SWCNT films but with lower transparency.
It should be considered that graphene sheets are competent candidates for laminated contact applications in OPVs.169,170 Song et al. employed graphene as the anode or cathode and/or both the anode and cathode for the OPVs (Fig. 6a).171 Graphene was synthesized on copper foil by a low-pressure CVD method, followed by depositing the polymeric layers of ethylene-vinyl-acetate (EVA) and PMMA. Afterward, the copper foil was removed to achieve a graphene/EVA/PMMA film. This film was scooped onto another piece of copper foil/graphene to produce a two-layer graphene film. The copper/two-layer graphene/EVA/PMMA stack was cut into small pieces and attached to the PDMS transfer medium. Then, the stack was annealed at 80 °C for 5 min, and PDMS was finally peeled off. As a result, flexible OPV devices with graphene as both the anode and cathode achieved a PCE of 3.8% with 61% device transparency. In a similar study, Tavakoli et al. laminated graphene/Cu/graphene foils between two EVA/PET substrates using a hot rolling process and modified the graphene quality by applying parylene as an interface layer on top of graphene (Fig. 6b).172 The Cl-containing parylene reduced the damage during transfer by improving the adhesion to graphene and enhancing its conductivity. Then, they applied the two stacks of graphene/parylene/EVA/PET with sheet resistances of <300 Ω sq−1 onto OPVs and achieved a PCE of 5.86% with the operational stability of over 30 days in ambient air. Also, Lee et al. fabricated semitransparent-inverted OPV devices with an alternative top electrode in the ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/GO/graphene architecture using a thermal release tape.82 First, graphene film was synthesized on the copper foil, and then a thermal release tape was attached to the graphene film. The same process was repeated on the Cu foil to obtain optimal graphene layers. Then, the graphene film was transferred onto the cell at the GO interface, and the thermal release tape was removed. For eight graphene layers, a low sheet resistance of ∼100 Ω sq−1 was achieved, and the laminated OPV device showed a maximum PCE of 2.4% compared to the standard cell-based on Ag electrode with 3.30% PCE.

In short, from the optical transparency and electrical conductivity point of view for graphene- and CNT-based laminated electrodes in OPVs, both can be considered competitors of TCO electrodes (>80% transparency and <40 Ω cm electrical resistance). However, the highest PCEs reported for the OPVs with laminated graphene as the bottom contact and CNTs as the top contact were 8.0% and 4.1%, respectively.167,172
3.3. Metal back contacts for OPVs
As mentioned earlier, the lamination method offers several advantages over metal evaporation. Highly conductive metallic top/bottom electrodes have also undergone the lamination methods rather than conventional vacuum-based methods, leading to enhanced PCE, improved stability, and avoiding the diffusion of the metal into the layers underneath in OPV devices. In this regard, Nakamura et al. deposited an Au electrode thermally on a glass substrate, followed by spin-coating a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS. Then, the glass/Au/PEDOT:PSS stack was laminated onto the ITO/TiO2/P3HT:PCBM stack by a hydrostatic pressurizer at a pressure of 1 MPa and a temperature of 150 °C, achieving a PCE of 3.3%.173 Similarly, Razali et al. investigated Au leaf as the top electrode for laminated OPVs based on P3HT:PC61BM.174 First, the Au leaf was coated on the PET substrate, and then it was transferred onto the solar cell at the interface of PEDOT:PSS. After which, a homogenous contact between the Au leaf and PEDOT:PSS was achieved under optimized lamination conditions, leading to a PCE of 2.8%. Moreover, the average PCE was increased to 5.07% when the PC61BM active layer was replaced with PC71BM.
In addition, silver films are among the most common metal back contacts employed in the OPVs lamination process.76,160,175,176 The fabrication of fully solution-processed OPV on the opaque substrate with laminated Ag-NWs films as the top anode was also reported by Gaynor et al.149 To prepare the top transparent electrode, the Ag-NW suspension was drop-cast on a pre-cleaned glass, followed by annealing at 180 °C for 1 h. Then, the Ag-NW mesh films were pressed onto the device stack at a pressure of 5.9 × 103 psi (=40.68 MPa) for 30 s by a clean glass to compress the nanowire mesh, leading to the elimination of the undesired roughness and decreasing the sheet resistance. The ITO bottom substrate was also replaced with vacuum-deposited Ag film. As a result, the laminated OPV with the Ag/Cs2CO3/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag nanowire structure achieved a PCE of 2.5%.
In brief, conventional lamination methods for the deposition of top/bottom electrodes and recent procedures to improve the performance of OPVs were reviewed. Depending on the contacts and CTLs, these methods include making an e-glue to stick the electrode onto the device, preparing free-standing carbon-based films and/or metal nanowires or nanoparticles on a substrate, and then pressing it onto the cell. The versatility of lamination methods could pave the way for the R2R production of semitransparent and tandem OPVs on flexible substrates with various device configurations.
The summarized device configuration, laminated electrodes, and photovoltaic characteristics of the lamination-produced OPVs in the literature are reviewed in Table 2.

The comparative view of the transport layers applied in lamination methods reviewed herein is presented in Table 3. The most remarkable lamination methods for the deposition of CTLs and/or bottom/top contacts to substitute the vacuum-based deposition of high-cost Au or rigid ITO glass in the PSC architecture were reviewed. The dry transfer-based methods (mainly dry stamp transfer) are the mainstream among the various lamination methods employed. This is because they enable the direct deposition of electrodes without damaging other moisture-sensitive layers within the devices. As a result, these methods could employ a broader range of materials. However, they require annealing, high temperature before applying, and a medium for sticking to the device stack. The e-glue-based lamination, as another major method, needs no further temperature during the process. Still, its components (mainly PH1000 and sorbitol) endanger the device's stability and performance in the long run. This review classified the most commonly employed laminate materials as PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) composites, various carbon films, and inorganic (metal) films. In each section, the mechanism and strategies for applying the deposition of electrodes using lamination methods in the literature about the specific PSC structure were briefly represented. One should consider the Fermi energy level alignment with perovskite or HTL, electrical conductivity, stability issues, ohmic interfacial resistance, and interfacial interactions between perovskite and HTL under high temperature and pressure when applying the lamination materials, and methods thereof in PSCs. Therefore, these methods primarily impact the FF of the devices if the laminated contact showed low conductivity and high series resistance. Also, ultrahigh pressure and destructive materials to the sensitive perovskite film would damage the current density and charge extraction at the interfaces. These could be the major challenges affecting the PCE and stability of the lamination-produced devices, which should be addressed to further boost their performance.

4. Conclusion and outlook
Lamination methods were introduced as one of the most promising methods for fabricating large-scale PSC and OPV devices to overcome the limitation of the standard thermal evaporation metal electrodes, i.e., Ag and Au. The lamination methods enable the production of cost-effective, easy-to-fabricate, self-encapsulated, and processable in ambient conditions solar cells and chemically inert electrodes to replace evaporated metal electrodes. These methods include the deposition of different thin films, and the majority of them focus on the top/bottom electrode.
This review discussed three well-known lamination electrodes based on PEDOT:PSS, carbon films, and metal back contacts for PSCs and OPVs. The performances of PSCs still lag behind the certified record of PSCs based on thermally-evaporated contacts by almost 5% in both small-scale and solar modules. This might have been due to the imperfect contact between the laminated electrodes and the device stack, leading to the poor electrical connection at the interfaces during the inserted pressure. However, the laminated PSCs achieved more success than their OPVs counterpart, reaching the best PCEs of 15.7%, 19.3%, and 17.4% for PEDOT:PSS, carbon films, and Au-laminated electrodes, respectively. Moreover, the carbon films have shown remarkable potential as a laminated electrode to fabricate highly efficient PSCs. On the other side, laminated OPVs achieved record PCEs of 5.3%, 6.2%, 8.0%, 4.1%, and 5.0% for PH1000 (PEDOT:PSS/D-sorbitol) as an e-glue electrode, PH1000 as a transfer-pressed electrode, graphene as the bottom contact, CNT as the top contact, and Au leaf as the top contact, respectively. Overall, CNTs, as a family of carbon films, have great potential within highly efficient OPVs.
Different parts of a device can be laminated to fabricate PSCs and OPVs. For example, in the PSCs section, we discussed the lamination of two different half-stacks from perovskite/perovskite interface deposited on separate substrates or wet pre-deposited HTL/perovskite interface, i.e., sandwich structure, laminating the polymeric top electrodes, carbon films, and metal back electrodes. For laminating the polymeric top electrodes (usually PEDOT:PSS/adhesive), it is typically coated on the transfer medium (PDMS, plastic wrap, glass, etc.) and then laminated on the second stack to solve the wettability challenge of the polymeric film during device fabrication. On the other hand, in the OPVs section, we also focused on laminating the photoactive polymer layer and the anode or cathode stacks. The commercialization of PSC and OPV devices is moving fast, opening the door for R2R production on flexible substrates and tandem structures.
