    , Accepted 7th December 2012First published on 7th December 2012AbstractA conjugated donor–acceptor porphyrin small molecule was designed and synthesized with diketopyrrolopyrrole as the acceptor unit. The new porphyrin-based small molecule exhibits broad and intense absorption in the visible and near IR regions, and the hole mobility and the power conversion efficiency of the bulk heterojunction devices based on the porphyrin:[6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (1:1, w/w) are increased up to 4.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 3.71%, respectively, which are further enhanced to 1.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.78%, respectively, upon the introduction of 3.0 vol% of pyridine additive. Further studies show that the performance of the solar cells based on other zinc porphyrins could also be improved by the pyridine additive.
Introduction
In recent years, the field of organic electronic devices, such as organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs), photodetectors (PDs) and photovoltaic cells (OPVs), has drawn a great deal of attention because of the advantages of low fabrication cost, light-weight and flexible devices using a high-throughput roll-to-roll manufacturing method.1–3 As promising alternatives to conjugated polymers, solution-processed organic small molecules have also been investigated by many groups since they can potentially combine the advantages of high purity, defined molecular structure and a more easily reproducible synthesis.4,5 To date, several classes of solution processable small molecules have been used as the donor materials in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells and the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have reached over 6% when blended with fullerene derivatives.6,7 However, the PCEs are still significantly below those of their polymer donor-based counterparts (over 9%),8 and thus more intensive research is still required to further improve the performance of small molecule-based solar cells.
The PCEs of the BHJ OPVs have improved significantly in the past decade due to the introduction of donor–acceptor (D–A) molecular structures,9–17 in which the intrinsic internal charge transfer (ICT) could lead to more desirable double-bond characteristics between the donor and the acceptor units to let the conjugated molecules adopt a more planar configuration and to allow the π-electrons be delocalized more efficiently. Recently, we introduced ethynylene linkages to increase the planarity in both a polymer and a porphyrin-based small molecule to improve the performance of OPVs.18,19 Especially, the conjugated D–A porphyrin – 5,15-bis-(7-(4-hexyl-thiophen-2-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4-yl-ethynyl)-10,20-bis(3,5-di(dodecyloxy)-phenyl)-porphyrin zinc (Por-1, Scheme 1) – exhibits a typically low band gap with the absorption extending up to 957 nm, a hole mobility of 7.4 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a PCE of up to 4.02% when blended with phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the electron acceptor, which is the highest value reported for solution-processed BHJ solar cells based on porphyrins.19 While the PCE is encouraging, its absorption spectrum shows a big valley centered at ca. 600 nm, which limits the harvesting of sunlight and its conversion into photocurrent. Furthermore, though the hole mobility is much higher than most of the reported porphyrins, it is still very low compared with those of good organic semiconductors, which restricted the thickness of the active layer to <65 nm in our previous devices and showed low optical-current response in the high wavelength range (650–950 nm).

The diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) unit is an attractive building block for OPVs, which shows desirable optical properties and sufficient solubility in organic solvents for spin-cast devices. Especially, its strong π-electron withdrawing properties provide the possibility to control the absorption spectrum into the near-IR (NIR) region via conjugation with electron-rich aromatic units,20,21 and its rigid and planar aromatic structure helps to enhance the inter-chain packing of a resulting molecule and therefore leads to a very high charge carrier mobility.22,23 Therefore, the DPP unit has been incorporated into numerous OPV donor materials in recent years and single junction devices with PCEs of 4–7% have been reported.24–27 Based on these considerations, in this work, we designed and synthesized a new small molecule 5,15-bis(2,5-bis-(2-ethyl-hexyl)-3,6-di-thienyl-2-yl-2,5-dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-5′-yl-ethynyl)-10,20-bis(3,5-di(dodecyloxy)phenyl)-porphyrin zinc (Por-2, Scheme 1) with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as the electron-deficient group to improve the performance of porphyrin-based OPVs.
On the other hand, the morphology of an active layer is one of the key factors needing to be considered in order to further enhance the performance of BHJ solar cells during device fabrication.28,29 It has been demonstrated that an ideal BHJ-morphology should contain domains of a perfect mixture of the donor and the acceptor, which should not only have the largest possible D/A interfacial layers to dissociate photo-generated excitons but also keep an interpenetrating network to transport both charge carrier types to the respective electrodes.29,30 Post-processing such as thermal annealing,31,32 and using solvent mixtures33,34 and additives35–37 could often lead to a better morphology to enhance the photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, good post-processing also can intensify the light absorption to let more sunlight be harvested and converted to photocurrent, which also makes a contribution to a better PCE.38
Usually, conjugated D–A porphyrins easily self-aggregate due to the big π-system and the planar conformation. Pyridine with the lone electron pair on the nitrogen atom could coordinate with the Zn atom in the porphyrin core. In our previous work, we initially used 1.0% pyridine to improve the solubility of the porphyrin by disrupting the intermolecular π-stacking utilizing this coordination interaction.39 Here, we further study the effect of pyridine as an additive on the morphology and the performance of zinc porphyrin-based OPVs in detail.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and optical absorption spectra

Por-2 was synthesized by the Sonogashira coupling reaction and the detailed synthesis procedure is shown in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 1, the absorption spectra of Por-2 in solution and in film give a good spectral coverage in the visible and NIR regions. Compared with that of Por-1,19 the absorption valley of Por-2 is narrowed significantly. Notably, the absorption of Por-2 film shows a new shoulder peak at 790 nm, which is attributed to the formation of a vibronic crystalline structure40 and could be beneficial to a higher hole mobility and photovoltaic performance for OPVs.3,41 The optical band gap of Por-2 is estimated to be 1.41 eV from the onset of the absorption spectrum in the film.

Electrochemical and thermal properties
The redox behaviors of Por-2 were investigated by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) in acetonitrile containing 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 as the supporting electrolyte (Fig. S1†). The onset oxidation (Eox) and onset reduction (Ered) potentials of Por-2 are 0.83 eV and −0.96 eV vs. Fe/Fe2+, respectively, from which the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are estimated to be −5.18 and −3.39 eV, respectively, according to the empirical formulae EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.35) (eV) and ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.35) (eV). The LUMO energy level is positioned 0.31 eV above the LUMO level of [6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) (−3.7 eV) to ensure an efficient photo-induced electron transfer. The energy level diagrams of the device components are illustrated in Fig. 2a. Meanwhile, the thermal stability of the Por-1 was determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S2†). The temperature for 5% weight loss is around 406 °C, indicating that the thermal stability of the molecule is good enough for its application in optoelectronic devices.

Photovoltaic characteristics
BHJ OPVs were fabricated with a general device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Por-2:PC61BM/PFN (poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)])/Al (Fig. 2b) with a film thickness of approximately 85 nm and were measured under AM 1.5 illumination, 100 mW cm−2. The incorporation of an ultrathin polymeric PFN layer as a cathode interlayer in bulk heterojunction solar cells has been reported to improve the electron injection/extraction contact and its chemical structure is shown in Fig. 2c.8,42–44 The device performance was firstly explored by blending Por-2 with PC61BM at different ratios ranging from 2:1 to 1:1.5 in chlorobenzene (CB)/1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) (Table S1 and Fig. S3†). The optimized weight ratio of Por-2 to PC61BM is found to be 1:1, yielding a PCE of 3.71% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.76 V, a short-circuit current (JSC) of 9.75 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 50.0%, and the typical current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics are shown in Fig. 3 and listed in Table 1.

Improved performance of the solar cells by the pyridine additive
The device fabrication conditions were further tuned by the use of 1.0, 3.0, and 6.0 vol% pyridine as a processing additive during the spin-casting step, and the typical J–V characteristics are also shown in Fig. 3 and listed in Table 1. The best device, which was processed with 3.0% pyridine, provides a PCE of 4.78% (with VOC = 0.80 V, JSC = 11.88 mA cm−2, and FF = 50.2%), which is increased by approximately 29% compared with that of the devices processed in neat CB/DCB solvent. In comparison with the devices fabricated without the additive, the most significant parameter affecting the performance of the solar cells is the JSC, which is greatly improved from 9.75 to 11.88 mA cm−2, while the VOC is only slightly increased and the FF remains almost unchanged.
To confirm the effect of the additive on the JSC of the OPVs, we measured the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the devices processed with and without pyridine, which are shown in Fig. 3b. The devices with and without pyridine both show a wide range of photocurrent generation in the region of 380–879 nm, but the EQEs in the whole region increase when pyridine is used as an additive. For example, the maximum EQE value at 570 nm increases from 34% to 43% after the addition of 3.0% pyridine.
Morphology characterization of the blends of Por-2–PC61BM processed with and without the pyridine additive
To gain insight into the performance enhancement upon the introduction of the pyridine additive, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the blend films processed with and without pyridine were investigated. The phase topography of the pristine film (Fig. 4a) exhibits microscale phase separation and the root-mean-square roughness value is 2.45 nm (Fig. 4c), while that processed with pyridine shows much smaller phase separation domains (Fig. 4b) and the root-mean-square roughness value is 1.68 nm (Fig. 4d). The surface of the blend film processed with the pyridine additive is smoother and has more grains, suggesting that it shows better morphological features for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transporting and should lead to an increased JSC for a corresponding solar cell.45,46

Optical properties and X-ray diffraction of the blends processed with pyridine additives
UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of the blends processed with and without pyridine additive were also measured to extract more information from the BHJ layers. These films were spin-cast from solution under identical conditions to the fabrication of OPV devices and the absorption spectra were not normalized. As shown in Fig. 5, with increasing pyridine content the peak positions of the blend films are nearly unchanged in comparison with those of the film deposited from neat CB/DCB solution, but the absorption intensities of the films become more pronounced. Considering that the absorption “shoulder” peak at 790 nm is assigned to the vibronic absorption of the ordered Por-2 crystalline regions,47 the more pronounced absorption peaks indicate a higher crystallinity of Por-2 in the blend films after the addition of pyridine,40 which is further demonstrated by the X-ray diffraction results (Fig. S5a†). The blend film processed with 3% pyridine shows a clear diffraction peak at 2θ = 2.68° and this peak is further increased for the film processed with 6% pyridine, while the film processed without pyridine additive almost shows no diffraction peak, indicating that the films become more structurally ordered as the amount of pyridine is increased.

Hole and electron mobilities of the devices processed with and without the pyridine additive
In order to explore the influence of adding the pyridine additive on the charge transport of the active layer, hole- and electron-only devices were fabricated and subsequently characterized. The thicknesses of the hole (electron)-only devices were almost the same as that in the solar cells and the mobilities were obtained through the space charge limited current (SCLC) method,48 and the J–V curves are shown in Fig. 6 and S6.† The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) are 1.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 9.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, for the devices based on Por-2 with 3.0% pyridine additive, and the μh/μe ratio is much smaller than that of the devices fabricated without the additive (μh = 4.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 1.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Apparently, the addition of the pyridine additive improves the hole mobility but decreases the electron mobility, leading to a more balanced charge transport. Furthermore, both the hole mobilities are much higher than that of the device based on Por-1 (7.6 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1), indicating that the introduction of DPP does improve the charge transport ability of the devices based on Por-2.

Improved performance of the solar cells and morphology investigation of the blends based on Por-1 by using the pyridine additive
To confirm the practical use of the pyridine additive to enhance the performance of the solar cells based on solution processed zinc porphyrins, a different amount of pyridine was used to fabricate the devices based on Por-1 and PC71BM in this study and the general device structure is the same as we previously reported.19 As shown in Fig. 7 and Table 2, the device processed without pyridine exhibits a VOC of 0.72 V, a JSC of 4.78 mA cm−2 and a FF of 46.9%, resulting in a PCE of 1.61%. After the addition of 0.5%, 1.0% and 3.0% pyridine, the PCEs are dramatically increased to 3.57%, 4.15% and 3.92%, respectively, indicating that the pyridine additive could also enhance the performance of OPVs based on other zinc porphyrins.

The measurements of AFM, XRD and the mobilities of the hole and electron-only devices based on Por-1 were also carried out to investigate the effects of the pyridine additive (Fig. S4–S6†). Quite similar to the case of Por-2, smaller phase separation domains, a higher degree of crystallinity and a more balanced charge transport were obtained when Por-1–PC71BM blend films were treated with pyridine, providing further evidence that pyridine could enhance the performance of porphyrin-based OPVs.
Conclusions
In summary, we present a novel small-molecule donor Por-2 incorporated with DPP units to improve the absorption in the visible and NIR regions and the hole mobility in the BHJ device, which leads to an enhanced photovoltaic performance of 3.71%. The PCEs of the BHJ OPVs are increased to 4.78% and 4.15% from 3.71% and 1.61% by incorporating 3.0% and 1.0% pyridine into the host solvent of Por-2:PC61BM and Por-1:PC71BM, respectively. The enhanced PCEs are attributed to the fact that a small quantity of pyridine additive could lead to a better interpenetrating network by preventing the active layers from undergoing large-scale phase separation, a more balanced charge transport, and a slight crystallinity enhancement. The results presented here demonstrate that conjugated D–A porphyrins are promising donor materials for application in solution processable OPVs, and pyridine could be used to improve the performance of metalloporphyrin-based solar cells. The studies of pyridine as an additive to OPVs based on other organometallic compounds are in progress.
