Broader context
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have ionic interdiffusion to hamper their stability. Herein, three linear molecules termed L1, L2 and L3 with a D–A–D′–A–D structure are developed as dopant-free hole transport materials (HTMs). The π-bridge extension with active sites for coordination leverages the intramolecular dipole effect and intermolecular packing effect, resulting in a conformally bonded ultrathin interface with compact and uniform coverage (∼60 nm) to retard iodine migration and protect the buried perovskite. L3-PSC maintains over 85% of the initial efficiency after 500 h at 85 °C maximum power point tracking (MPP) and realizes the possibility of using small molecules to stabilize n–i–p PSCs. It provides an effective strategy to address the intractable problem of PSCs towards commercialization.

Introduction
During the last decade, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of both p–i–n and n–i–p type perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been boosted to over 25%.1,2 However, the device durability is still one of the most challenging obstacles to realize their commercialization. It is encouraging that some reported p–i–n (inverted) PSCs have demonstrated superior thermal stability (at 85 °C)3–5 and passed the damp-heat test according to the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61215:2016 regulations,2,6 which was mainly ascribed to the progress in stable dopant-free electron/hole transport layers (ETM/HTM). In contrast, the high efficiency n–i–p (conventional) PSCs rely on the lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butyl pyridine (t-BP) additives to improve hole mobility (∼10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and carrier conductivity (10−8 S cm−1) of pristine 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD).7–9 The ionic interdiffusion between hygroscopic dopants/additives and halides of perovskite can cause device degradation, especially under continuous thermal and illumination conditions.10,11 Hence, the currently reported operational lifetime values of state-of-the-art n–i–p PSCs according to the ISOS protocols lag much behind the one of p–i–n PSCs (Table S1, ESI†). Therefore, developing stable and efficient HTMs is a necessary strategy to endow n–i–p PSCs with both high PCEs and superior device operation lifetime for their potential commercialization.
The desired HTMs for the n–i–p PSCs with high performance should have a well-aligned energy level with perovskite, a sufficiently high hole mobility, superior chemical and photothermal stability, and should passivate the surface trap density at the perovskite/HTL interface as well.12–17 By now, several types of dopant-free HTMs have been developed. Inorganic HTMs, such as NiOx18 and CuSCN,19 enable long-term stable PSCs. Organic polymeric HTMs have shown promising stability and film-forming properties.20–23 Hou and co-workers have introduced a dopant-free PDCBT polymer as the HTM in PSCs. In combination with the tantalum doped tungsten oxide, a bilayer hole extraction contact led to PSCs with negligible hysteresis and a PCE of over 21%.20,24 Recently, HTMs based on a dopant-free polymer achieved PCEs of over 24% as well.25–27 Small molecular HTMs can be precisely controlled to yield chemically pure and structurally homogeneous products and thus show great potential for achieving PSCs with uniform properties and high reproducibility.13,14,28–30
So far, the reported small molecular HTMs for PSCs can be categorized into donor–π–donor (D–π–D) type, acceptor–D–acceptor (A–D–A) type, D–A–D type and D–A–π–A–D type configurations.31 As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), spiro-OMeTAD as well as its derivative spiro-mF, the most famous D–π–D type HTM, exhibited limited hole mobility for dopant-free PSCs, because the rigid orthogonal spirobifluorene hinders the formation of close π–π stacking and the propeller-like triphenylamine induces a large intermolecular distance.32 In order to improve hole mobility, the linear D–π–D type molecules with enhanced intermolecular π–π interactions have been developed to increase the mobility for dopant-free HTMs (Fig. S1, ESI†). For example, Tang and co-workers employed a dithia[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole core as π-bridge to synthesize DTPC13-ThTPA and DTP-C6Th, with which dopant-free PSCs achieved a PCE of 20.38% and 21.04%, respectively.33,34 Loo and co-workers synthesized the HTM of YZ22 with 1,10-phenanthroline as the π-bridge and demonstrated that YZ22 also effectively passivated defects and hence boosted the PCE to 22.4%.13 The D–A molecular backbone has a high dipole moment to induce intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), though it is regarded that the charge mobility and extraction capability can be further improved,35 and thus A–D–A type with a large-sized donor and D–A–D type HTM are progressing as dopant-free PSCs (Fig. S1, ESI†). For example, Yang and co-workers synthesized an A–D–A type DOR3T-TBDT HTM36 and changed the core unit with an even larger-sized alkylthienyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene donor for DERDTS-TBDT HTM (Fig. S1, ESI†) for better performance.37 The incorporation of electron acceptor can not only enhance the performance, but also improve the intrinsic photothermal stability.30 Moreover, Zhu and co-workers designed a series of quinoxaline-based D–A–D type HTMs (TQ1, TQ2, and TQ3) and extended the π-conjugation with a quinoxaline core to form TQ4. The PCE of PSCs with TQ4 was increased to 21.03%.30,38 D–A–D small molecules based on imide-functionalized thiophene (BTTI-C6, BTTI-C8, and BTTI-C12) were also developed and the dopant-free planar PSCs with BTTI-C6 HTL achieved an efficiency of 19.69%.39 Recently, the D–A–π–A–D type molecule DTB-FL and BDT-DPA-F were employed as dopant-free HTMs in PSCs.28,40 However, these small molecules cannot inhibit the ionic interdiffusion and pass the harsh stability test, e.g. damp-heat, 85 °C maximum power point (MPP) test. There is still plenty of room to engineer the structure units for photothermal stable PSCs.28,30,41 It is meaningful to deliver a compact and tightly-bonded interface to retard the ionic interfusion (e.g. iodine migration) and ameliorate the 85 °C MPP stability.
In this work, we employ indacenodithiophene (IDT)-based weak donor (D′) derivatives with a sequentially extended π-bridge, in combination with a methoxy triphenylamine donor and benzothiadiazole acceptor, to synthesize three D–A–D′–A–D type linear molecules (named L1, L2, and L3) (Fig. 1(a)). IDT has a coplanar symmetrical structure, in which the three aromatic rings are in conjugation, and a bridging atom fixes the coplanarity between the adjacent rings. It is an excellent candidate as the π-bridge, which maximizes the π orbital overlap and hence reduces the photoexcited energetic disorder.42 We find that expanding the side chain by four 4-hexylphenyl substituents to form L2 from L1 can regulate intermolecular interactions but slightly increases the intramolecular distortion.43,44 Extending the backbone with two thieno[3,2-b]thiophene units to form indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT in L3) can restore linearity and reduce intramolecular distortion. Through fine tuning of the molecular structure, hole mobility, glass transition temperature (Tg) and intermolecular order are gradually improved.45 Compared to our recent work, IDT/IDTT-based weak donors possess active sites to coordinate to the perovskite, endowing the perovskite with a conformally bonded molecular interface, which is verified by the grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) patterns and is beneficial for retarding iodine migration as well as device stability.28 L1, L2 and L3 deliver 20.20%, 21.05% and 21.90% efficiency for dopant-free PSCs, respectively. Through optical optimization, L3-based PSC (L3-PSC) finally achieved a champion PCE of 22.61%, which significantly exceeds the PCE of 15.87% for dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs. Rapid carrier transport, sequentially reduced disorder and improved defect passivation capability of the L-series are also demonstrated by ultrafast laser spectroscopy. Compared with the PSCs with doped spiro-OMeTAD, the unencapsulated L3-PSCs show promising long-term stability under various conditions. It maintains 90% of the initial PCE after 2736 hours stored in an argon-filled glovebox. Owing to the tightly bonded conformal coverage and interaction between L3 and perovskite, L3-PSCs can maintain ∼85% initial value after 500 hour at 85 °C MPP tracking. This work not only provides important guidelines for the multi-objective optimization of PSCs by independently tuning the energy level, hole mobility, thermal stability, solubility, and film-forming properties of dopant-free HTMs, but also demonstrates the possibility of using small molecules to address the key challenge of harsh 85 °C MPP for n–i–p PSCs.

Results and discussion
Molecular synthesis and properties
It is important to introduce substantial active sites for coordination onto a perovskite to strengthen the interface and thus deliver high photothermal stable properties for molecular film. The molecular design strategy for L1, L2, and L3 is described in Fig. 1(a) and π-bridge extension with two thieno[3,2-b]thiophene is employed to strengthen coordination bonding (Fig. 1(b)). The corresponding synthetic steps are presented in the ESI† (see Schemes S1–S4). Briefly, L1, L2, and L3 were synthesized via Stille coupling of different IDT tin reagents with the intermediate TPAOMe-BT-Br.28 We first enlarged the side chain of the IDT π-bridge from alkyl to alkylaryl (L1 to L2) and then extended the backbone π-bridge unit of the IDT by two thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) units (L2 to L3). The chemical structures for intermediate and target molecules were carefully characterized by 1H- and 13C-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) as well as matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization on a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALD-ToFMS) (Fig. S2–S11, ESI†). The yields of L1, L2, and L3 are 85.5%, 90.5% and 83.8%, respectively.
The thermal properties of L1, L2, and L3 were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The recorded TGA curves in Fig. S12 (ESI†) exhibit a high decomposition temperature (Td) of 440 °C for L1, 449 °C for L2, and 449 °C for L3 during the heating process at a 5% weight loss. In addition, DSC measurement revealed a high Tg of 105 °C for L1 HTM, 120 °C for L2 HTM, and 163 °C for L3 HTM (see Fig. S13, ESI†), which are much higher than that of doped spiro-OMeTAD (72 °C).46 In particular, the L3 with a Tg of 163 °C higher than that of pristine spiro-OMeTAD (125 °C),47 which is expected to be beneficial for the thermal stability of dopant free HTMs based PSCs.
The geometric structures of L1, L2, and L3 are elucidated using density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. From the optimized geometries in Fig. S14 (ESI†), the backbones of three molecules all exhibit a small twisting between the main building blocks. For L1, the torsion angle between benzothiadiazole (A) and the adjacent phenyl (D) is 32.93°/31.41° (left/right sides) and the torsion angle between benzothiadiazole (A) and thiophene (π) is 6.32°/2.90°. For L2 with the increased size of alkylaryl side chain, slightly larger torsion angle values (34.57°/33.61°, 7.46°/5.69°) were found. For L3, the torsion angle values slightly decrease (33.67°/33.9°, 6.54°/4.43°) due to the increased linear structure and are between the ones for L1 and L2. The D–A parts at both sides have larger torsion than the A–π–A parts in the middle due to the more bulky structure of the donor.
We performed electrostatic potential (ESP) analysis for the electronic structure from the DFT calculation (Fig. S15, ESI†). In the ground state, both the benzothiadiazole unit (A) and thiophene-spacer of the IDT unit (π) present high electron densities, and thus can provide favourable coordination sites for under-coordinated Pb2+ in the perovskite film.28,48 As shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†), the HOMOs are delocalized throughout triphenylamine moieties, the benzothiadiazole and π-bridge IDT unit, while the LUMOs are concentrated on the benzothiadiazole and partially delocalized to the thiophene. Therefore, there is a good electronic push–pull effect within the molecule leading to a significant dipole moment, which is in favour of charge transport.
Device performance
The PSCs were fabricated with the structure of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/HTM/MoO3/Ag, where the perovskite film without post-treatment with PEAI was fabricated by the “two-step” method according to previous work and HTMs were spin-coated for tight anchorage via coordination bonding (Fig. 1(b)).49,50 The systematic optimization of processing conditions for the HTMs is presented in Fig. S17 and Tables S3, S4 (ESI†). We found that the dopant-free HTM with a concentration of 12 mg mL−1 in CB solvent at a speed of 4000 rpm achieved the champion efficiency. As shown in Fig. 1(c), L3-PSC reaches a PCE of 21.90% under the AM 1.5 G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.12 V, a short-circuit photocurrent (JSC) of 24.75 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 78.70%. It is higher than that of the best L1-PSC and L2-PSC with a PCE of 20.20% and 21.05%, respectively. The control devices based on spiro-OMeTAD with/without Li-TFSI and tBP have PCE of 21.94% and 15.87% in this work. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1.

The statistics of the detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. S18 (ESI†). All three dopant-free HTMs-based PSCs showed high reproducibility. Compared with L1-PSCs and L2-PSCs, the enhanced PCE of L3-PSCs is mainly ascribed to an increased VOC and FF (see Table S5, ESI†). The similar JSC values are consistent with the absorption profiles of perovskite films coated with different HTMs (Fig. S19, ESI†). Furthermore, the calculated JSC values from integrating the IPCE spectra in Fig. S2 (ESI†) confirm the photocurrents determined from J–V analysis.
Most importantly, the PCE of L3-PSCs can be further enhanced to 22.61% by employing an AR film to reduce light reflection at the glass substrate (Fig. 1(d)). This performance is comparable with the state-of-the-art PCE with dopant-free small-molecular HTMs recently reported in the literature (Fig. 1(e) and Table S2, ESI†) and the doped spiro-OMeTAD PSCs (Fig. S21, ESI†). As shown in Fig. S22 (ESI†), the L3-PSC achieved a PCE 21.79% certified by China CEPREI Laboratory with a mask area of 0.0525 cm2.
The cross-sectional SEM images of the overall device are depicted in Fig. S23 (ESI†). The optimal thickness of the dopant free L1/L2/L3 HTM is found to be ∼60 nm, which is much lower than the thickness of doped spiro-OMeTAD HTM (∼180 nm). It is surprising that the conformal coverage of ultrathin molecular films is sufficient to guarantee efficient hole extraction and electron blocking, leading to the acceptable photovoltage and FF. Hence, we perform a series of experiments to illustrate the performance–structure–stability relationship.
Film microstructure
In order to reveal the microstructure, the molecular packing of L1, L2 and L3 neat films was firstly investigated by GIWAXS. As shown in Fig. 2(a)–(d), all films exhibit two weak and broad scattering peaks centered at q = ∼0.36 Å−1 and q = ∼1.34 Å−1, which can be attributed to the lamellar packing and π–π stacking, respectively. The low film crystallinity indicates that the films are predominantly amorphous due to their relatively twisted backbone.24 Nonetheless, we found that the L3 film presents a higher peak position of the π–π stacking at q = 1.350 Å−1 than those of the L1 (1.340 Å−1) and L2 (1.347 Å−1) films, suggesting that the L3 molecules are packed more tightly in the film, which is beneficial for intermolecular charge transfer and inhibiting ionic interdiffusion. To some extent, these results are in good agreement with the slightly enhanced hole mobility from L1 to L3.
 Fig. 2  Film microstructure suggests L-series HTMs have compact molecular packing and conformally bonded coverage with ultrathin thickness on the perovskite.

AFM images (e)–(h) and top-view SEM images (i)–(l) of the perovskite film, perovskite/L1, perovskite/L2, and perovskite/L3. 
To further analyse the surface morphology of the HTM layers, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed. As shown in Fig. S24, ESI† and Fig. 2(e)–(h), the three HTMs coated on perovskite films could provide a continuous and dense coverage that smooths the perovskite surface. The root mean square (RMS) roughness of perovskite films covered with L1, L2, and L3 HTM are estimated to be 5.40, 4.36, and 4.86 nm, respectively, significantly smaller than that of bare perovskite film (RMS = 13.0 nm). Compared with the RMS value of a perovskite film covered with L1 HTM, the decreased RMS values of perovskite layers with L2 and L3 demonstrate that the substitution of the alkyl aryl group for an alkyl group in the side chain of the IDT π-bridge is an effective strategy to improve their film formation capability.
Scan electron microscopy (SEM) supports the microstructure of AFM. There is a typical perovskite film morphology with few bright PbI2 spots as shown in the SEM images in Fig. 2(i).51 After coating with HTMs of L1/L2/L3 (Fig. 2(j)–(l)), we can clearly distinguish the grain pattern of the perovskite, which shows a very similar surface morphology to the bare perovskite. This indicates that the HTMs are uniformly and conformally covered on the surface of the perovskite film like a “leotard”, which is conducive to the interfacial hole extraction and transport.48
The uniform, dense and conformal coverage is further revealed by TEMs (Fig. 3). We prepared the samples with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM by spin-coating, and then immersed the samples in deionized water to dissolve the bottom PEDOT:PSS film, leaving behind HTM films floating on the water surface (see the Video in the ESI†). The films were collected by a copper grid for characterization. TEM images confirm L-series have uniform, dense and conformal coverage in the amorphous state while the doped spiro-OMeTAD film has small grains in the crystalline state (Fig. 3). Due to the flexible backbone, L-series HTMs are much more stable than doped spiro-OMeTAD film. Surface tension will make the spiro-OMeTAD film crack into pieces while the L-series films retains an overall structure after soaking in water (Fig. 3(a)–(h)). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images (Fig. 3(i)–(l)) confirm the amorphous state of L-series and crystalline grains in the dot structure of the spiro-OMeTAD film. The brittleness of spiro-OMeTAD grains will make the film not stable enough. During the HRTEM test, sequentially improved membrane quality was observed after using a high intensity electron beam for the duration test, which is consistent with the sequentially increased Tg as aforementioned. More importantly, it is notable that this pin-hole free and dense film with ultrathin thickness of L-series HTMs will help to suppress the ionic interdiffusion and protect the buried perovskite, which will be discussed in the following section.
 Fig. 3  TEM indicates L-series films are stronger than the spiro-OMeTAD film. TEM images of (a) and (e) L1 film, (b) and (f) L2 film, (c) and (g) L3 film, and (d) and (h) doped spiro-OMeTAD film. HRTEM images of (i) L1 film, (j) L2 film, (k) L3 film, and (l) doped spiro-OMeTAD film. 
All the L-series HTMs exhibit extremely high hydrophobicity. Their water contact angles (θ) are larger than 90°, which is significantly higher than that of the spiro-OMeTAD film (θ = 73.6°, see Fig. S25, ESI†). Meanwhile, the enlarged water contact angles from L1 to L2 to L3 could be ascribed to the additional aromatic rings of side chains and enlarged fused-rings of main chains.30,35 The degradation images of perovskite films in Fig. S26 (ESI†) also suggest that the strong hydrophobicity of the L-series HTMs efficiently protects the perovskite film from the degradation by atmospheric moisture. This result is also consistent with membrane structure judging from theTEM images.
Photo-excited energy disorder
To further understand the photo-excited properties of L1–L3 HTMs, ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) was applied, and a sequentially reduced energy disorder was observed. As shown in Fig. 4(a)–(f), all three HTMs exhibit a broad positive signal at 500–650 nm and an additional transient positive signal at 650–720 nm when excited at 400 nm. The feature at 500–650 nm can be assigned to ground state photobleaching (GSB) that coincides with the peak of the steady-state absorption spectra (Fig. S27, ESI†). The positive feature at 650–720 nm coincides with the steady state PL spectrum (Fig. S28, ESI†), and is assigned to stimulated emission (SE).
 Fig. 4  TAS suggests L-series films have sequentially reduced photoexcited energy disorder. 2D colour plot of TAS of (a) L1, (b) L2, and (c) L3; TAS plots of (d) L1, (e) L2, and (f) L3 HTM films; (g) GSB kinetics at 550–580 nm, and (h) SE kinetics at 660–670 nm; (i) shows the differences in kinetics between GSB and SE. , where A and τ are the fitted amplitudes and the lifetimes of the multi-exponential fitting. The HTM was excited at 400 nm wavelength with an excitation fluence of ∼5 μJ cm−2. 
The full ground-state recovery of photo-excited HTM films takes over 1 ns. The decay curves were best fit with triexponential functions, indicative of a broad overlap of multiple decay pathways.52 To compare the GSB decay times, an amplitude average decay time constant of 230, 190, and 250 ps was extracted for L1, L2, and L3, respectively (Fig. 4(g)). The SE probes the excited state that correlates with the fluorescence in the system. The SE grows in the first few ps as the emissive states are populated. L1 shows a rapid decay within 100 ps, whereas L2 and L3 takes significantly longer, with L3 having not decayed completely even at 1 ns (Fig. 4(h) and (i)). The observation of decay behaviour of the excited state (probed by SE) and the GSB that is independent of each other, indicates the generation of multiple species following photoexcitation.52 Interestingly, the extended excited state lifetime of L2 and L3 suggests a reduced recombination rate which is generally regarded as a beneficial quality criterion for electronic materials.
In addition, L1–L3 HTMs exhibit the reduced miscellaneous peaks and a sequentially narrowed GSB and SE width. This is due to better alignment and enhanced π–π stacking as suggested as well from the GIWAXS data and can be indicative of enhanced intermolecular charge transport of L3 HTM (Fig. 2(d)). This property is not observed in the static UV-Vis absorption spectra and PL (Fig. S27 and S28, ESI†). The narrowing GSB and SE width suggests the reduction of photo-excited energy disorder, which is important for photovoltaics under illumination as well as the photothermal stability under MPP test.
Band alignment and mobility
We analyse the band alignment in-detail. In the film, the main absorption peaks of L1, L2, and L3 are located at 583, 570 and 569 nm (Table 2 and Fig. S27, ESI†), respectively. Compared with the solution, a red shift of the main peak is observed in the corresponding thin films, which may be attributed to the enhanced intermolecular stacking induced electron delocalization.53–55 From the Tauc plots of L1, L2, and L3 in Fig. S29 (ESI†), the optical band gaps (Eoptg) of L1, L2, and L3 films were determined to be 1.94, 1.95 and 1.96 eV, respectively. The detailed optical and parameters are listed in Table 2.

From the oxidation potential of C–V curves (Fig. S30, ESI†), the HOMO energy levels were calculated to be −5.26, −5.31 and −5.32 eV for L1, L2, and L3, respectively.55 According to the HOMO values from C–V curves and the Eoptg from the solid film of HTMs, the LUMO levels of L1, L2, and L3 are calculated to be −3.32, −3.36 and 3.36 eV, respectively. The deeper HOMO values of L2 and L3 may better match the VB edge position of the perovskite.56,57 The energy level diagram of all three HTMs and the perovskite film are given in Fig. 5(a), and one can see that L2 and L3 have a deeper lying HOMO level and can be expected to provide a better energetic match between the perovskite and the anode interface.

The hole transport behaviour of L1, L2, and L3 films was determined by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a device structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/HTM/MoO3/Ag (Fig. S31, ESI†). All three HTMs exhibited similar hole mobility values of 2.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for L1, 3.28 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for L2 and 3.46 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for L3, which are higher than that of the dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD (1.57 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). Although the hole mobility is not very high, it can extract the holes effectively and block the recombination in ultrathin thickness (∼60 nm) in this work judging from their performance aforementioned.
Charge extraction, passivation effect and chemical bonding
The PCE of PSCs with dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD HTM is 15.87%, which is lower than that of L3-PSC, mainly due to the low VOC and FF (see Fig. S32, ESI† and Table 1). Compared with the PCE of 21.94% for doped spiro-OMeTAD PSC, L3-PSC also exhibits a comparable efficiency of 21.90%, but also shows a higher and more stable output efficiency at maximum power point (MPP) within 120 s (Fig. S32 and S33, ESI†). In our case, we do not deposit PEAI on the perovskite surface to passivate surface defects, but we find that the photovoltage is acceptable. Therefore, the charge transfer and passivation effect of L-series HTM are further identified. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured on glass/perovskite/HTM samples (Fig. S34, ESI†). After covering the perovskite film with HTM, the PL intensity is obviously quenched, especially when it is covered by L3 HTM, indicating that the three HTMs have strong hole extraction and transfer capabilities.56
The time resolved PL (TRPL) of the perovskite films with different HTMs were further preformed, as shown in Fig. S35a (ESI†). It is evident from the magnified spectra in Fig. S35b (ESI†) that the PL decay consists of a fast component followed by a long-lived component in the perovskite films covered with HTMs. The TRPL were fitted with tri-exponential decays, as shown in Fig. S36 (ESI†), and the fitted corresponding parameters are summarized in Table S6 (ESI†). Tri-exponential decays gives a better fit than traditional bi-exponential decays, which is probably due to the charge extraction/transport (τ1), the recombination processes of the perovskite film (τ2, τ3, defect/trap assisted non-radiative recombination particularly at interfaces/grain boundaries, and the bulk PL recombination) that can be significantly extended with passivation. As listed in Table S6 (ESI†), the long-lived components of L-series perovskite films were greatly improved compared with the bare perovskite film. This indicated the passivation effect of L-series HTM on the perovskite film. Furthermore, differential lifetime was modelled by fitting the TRPL spectra (Fig. 5(b)) with the equation of t = −(dln(φ(t))/dt)−1,58,59 where φ(t) is the time-dependent PL photon flux. As shown in Fig. 5(c), the processes that reduce the PL counts over time are separable, and the lifetime t is directly readable at each time point.59
The perovskite films with L-series HTMs exhibit a faster charge extraction process than that of doped spiro-OMeTAD HTM. A rapid charged extraction process from the perovskite film to L3 HTM was observed within 10 ns (green region in Fig. 5(c)), which can be mainly ascribed to the extended backbone of the IDTT π-bridge with deep HOMO energy level and high mobility.44 While the doped spiro-OMeTAD has a faster transport due to its higher mobility. Compared with 21.94% efficiency of the doped spiro-OMeTAD PSCs, L3 PSCs also have a comparable efficiency of 21.9%. This performance is also consistent with TRPL data.
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurement was carried out to confirm the chemically-bonded passivation of perovskite surface by L3 HTM. As shown in Fig. S37, ESI† and Fig. 5(d), the CH2-S peak in the thiophene moiety in L3 slightly shifted after mixing with PbI2, from 1240 cm−1 to 1248 cm−1, respectively. The CN stretch peak in the benzothiadiazole moiety of 1598 cm−1 also shifted to 1603 cm−1. These results indicate that chemical bonding between PbI2 and the benzothiadiazole and thiophene moieties of L3 occurred with lone pair electrons. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was further performed, as shown in Fig. S38 (ESI†). Compared to the bare perovskite film, a shift of the Pb2+ 4f towards lower binding energy was observed for the perovskite film covered with L3 HTM, indicating the functional groups in L3 could donate the lone pair electrons to the empty 6p orbital of Pb2+via the coordination interactions and effectively passivate the defects and suppress the defect-assisted recombination at the interface between the perovskite film and HTMs.28,48 The I 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 signals for perovskite/L3 shift to a lower binding energy compared to those in the XPS spectrum of bare perovskite film. We believe this shift stems from L3 donating electrons to Pb2+, which perturbs the static interactions between Pb2+ and I− at the interface.13 A small shift of N 1s and S 2p also occurs in the perovskite film coated with L3 HTM and the peak of O 1s does not shift. These results are in good agreement with the FTIR measurement, which demonstrate chemical bonding passivation between PbI2 and the benzothiadiazole and thiophene moieties of L3 HTM.
The trap density was further quantified by the SCLC method. The dark J–V curves of hole-only devices were measured with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/HTM/MoO3/Ag. We evaluated the trap-state density via the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), obtained from nt = qεε0VTFL/(qL2),61–63 where q is the elementary charge, ε is the relative dielectric constant, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, L is the thickness of the perovskite film, and VTFL is the trap-filling limit voltage. As shown in Fig. 5(e) and (f), V2 gives the most accurate value for the trap density due to the mixed ionic and electronic nature of perovskites.63 The trap densities were calculated to be 1.26 × 1016 and 1.14 × 1016 cm−3 by V2 for the devices with doped spiro-OMeTAD and L3 HTL, respectively, with similar values to each other. For the standard spiro-OMeTAD, the dopants can not only enhance the conductivity (Li–salt), but can passivate perovskite film by the pyridine group.64 For L3 HTL, the low trap states may be attributed to the reduced energy disorder of L3 and passivation effect on the perovskite film.40 L3 HTL has a much thinner thickness (∼60 nm) than doped spiro-HTL to block the charge recombination event at the interface, due to close packing, coordination interaction and conformal coverage. Therefore, L3 PSC has a similar PV performance to the doped spiro-OMeTAD PSC in our system.
Stability
We tested the stability of L-series PSCs and control devices with doped spiro-OMeTAD HTM. Firstly, the unencapsulated devices were stored in a glovebox filled with argon under dark conditions. Over 2700 hours, L3-PSC retained 90% of its initial value and the control device had 85% (Fig. S39, ESI†). This result indicates that dopant free HTM in PSCs can avoid ionic interdiffusion to degrade the perovskite film and prolong the long-term storage stability of PSCs. Secondly, the 85 °C thermal stability measurement under an argon atmosphere was performed. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the PCE of PSCs with doped spiro-OMeTAD HTM quickly decayed to 70% of their initial values within 200 hours, whereas the L3-PSC maintained ∼83% of their initial PCE after ∼1000 hours. Finally, the stability at 85 °C and MPP tracking was determined to evaluate the photothermal stability of the unencapsulated devices under white LEDs at one-sun intensity. As shown in Fig. 6(b), the L3-PSC could maintain 85% of its initial efficiency after over 500 hours, while the control PSC dropped rapidly within 100 hours. This is the best photothermal stability of the PSCs with dopant-free organic small molecule HTMs (Fig. 1(d) and Table S2, ESI†).

The promising thermal stability of L3-PSCs reveals that dopant-free L3 HTM with a high Tg of 163 °C exhibits a more stable molecular configuration than that of doped spiro-OMeTAD HTM with a Tg of ∼72 °C.46 From the XRD patterns of perovskite film in Fig. S41 (ESI†), the low PbI2 peak diffraction and strong (001) perovskite peaks in the aged perovskite film with L3 HTM confirm the improved stability for perovskite covered with L3 HTM. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S41 (ESI†), both the doped spiro-OMeTAD and L3 HTMs-covered perovskite films were found to exhibit red-shifted absorption edges in the UV-vis absorption spectra for aged perovskite film, indicating that the perovskite itself inevitably degrades through the loss of chloride component under heating conditions.65,66 This may be one of the reasons for the slightly decreased efficiency of L3-PSC under the 85 °C thermal aging test. Although the colour of the perovskite film does not change significantly (see the images in Fig. S42a, ESI†), degradation spots appeared on the surface of the spiro-OMeTAD film after aging under 85 °C for 10 days as shown in Fig. S42b (ESI†). These degradational spots at the interface between spiro-OMeTAD HTL and metal electrode will further impair the efficiency of the PSCs.
In order to further analyse the influence of the HTM morphology on device efficiency under heating conditions, we used AFM to characterize the morphology of bare HTM before and after heating. As shown in Fig. 6(c)–(f), the morphology of doped spiro-OMeTAD film shows an obvious agglomeration after aging at 100 °C for 10 hours accompanied by an increase in surface roughness. On the contrary, negligible changes in the morphology of the L3 film could be detected before and after 10 hours aging. Moreover, when the heating time is prolonged to 100 hours, the L3 film can still maintain the dense and smooth morphology (Fig. S43, ESI†), strongly suggesting the excellent thermal stability of L3 HTM.
Furthermore, the ToF-SIMS of depth profiles of iodine anion (I−) distribution was carried out to analyse ion migration within complete PSCs. As shown in Fig. 6(g)–(j), substantial iodine was detected in the spiro-OMeTAD layer for the fresh and aged control device based on doped spiro-OMeTAD due to ionic interdiffusion between Li–salt and iodide ions. The ionic interdiffusion in the fresh control device occurs during the spin-coating process. The additive species can penetrate into the perovskite and iodine can diffuse into the HTL layer, resulting in an iodine gradient area. As shown in Fig. 6(g) and (h), this interdiffusion area was enlarged in the spiro-OMeTAD layer after a thermal aging process. The iodine migration is the major reason for performance degradation for traditional n–i–p PSCs. In contrast, iodine is flatly distributed inside the whole perovskite layer in L3-PSC. After thermal annealing at 85 °C for 10 days, the diffusion of I− ions from the perovskite layer to the Au anion electrode could be significantly suppressed in L3-PSC compared to the control device based on doped spiro-OMeTAD, by a factor of ∼100. This again underlines that the dense and conformal film coverage of L3 HTM at 85 °C can prevent the iodine migration, leading to ionic fixation and enhanced photothermal stability of L3-PSCs. Therefore, under dopant-free conditions, the ionic interdiffusion is greatly suppressed by L3 because of the conformal bonding with the perovskite surface.
Conclusions
We reported photothermal stable conventional PSCs with high efficiency based on dopant-free small molecule HTMs with a D–A–D′–A–D configuration. By engineering the IDT π-bridge, the four 4-hexylphenyl side chains and two TT units in the IDT π-bridge main chain make L3 HTM possess good film formation quality and appropriate energy levels, ensuring the efficient charge transport performance. Meanwhile, surface passivation effects by the functional group in HTM also endow the L3 layer with great benefits in charge transport and extraction property at the perovskite/HTM interface with reduced interfacial recombination loss and suppressed ionic interdiffusion. Therefore, PSCs with three HTMs (L1, L2 and L3) all showed PCEs of more than 20%, and in particular the PSCs with L3 HTM delivered a champion PCE of 22.61% with an antireflection film. More importantly, due to the high mobility and Tg of L-series HTMs, the dopant-free L3 HTM could avoid the negative effect of additives on the perovskite layer and maintain high quality morphology of HTL. As a result, the PSCs with the dopant-free L3 HTM exhibited great photothermal and operational stability under 85 °C, which maintained 83% of the initial PCE after ∼1000 hours in the dark, and 85% of the initial PCE after 500 hours with continuous illumination measured at MPP in the argon-filled glovebox. We demonstrated that the conformally bonded ultrathin interface with compact and uniform coverage (∼60 nm) to retard iodine migration and protect the buried perovskite. Ultrafast laser spectroscopy revealed that L-series molecules have sequential reduction of photoexcited energy disorder to illustrate the structure–performance–stability relationship. This work provides a strategy to design high mobility and Tg HTM and shows a promising application prospect of small molecular HTM with the D–A–D′–A–D configuration in conventional n–i–p PSCs.

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have ionic interdiffusion to hamper their stability. Herein, three linear molecules termed L1, L2 and L3 with a D–A–D′–A–D structure are developed as dopant-free hole transport materials (HTMs). The π-bridge extension with active sites for coordination leverages the intramolecular dipole effect and intermolecular packing effect, resulting in a conformally bonded ultrathin interface with compact and uniform coverage (∼60 nm) to retard iodine migration and protect the buried perovskite. L3-PSC maintains over 85% of the initial efficiency after 500 h at 85 °C maximum power point tracking (MPP) and realizes the possibility of using small molecules to stabilize n–i–p PSCs. It provides an effective strategy to address the intractable problem of PSCs towards commercialization.
