    , Accepted 9th March 2019First published on 11th March 2019AbstractAnchoring groups play an important role in the structure of dyes by determining the charge injection efficiency and the bonding degree between the sensitizer and the semiconductor surface. In this work, two new 2D–π–2A-type metal-free organic dyes S1 and S2 with bipyridine anchoring groups were synthesized and applied in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The IR spectra indicated that the two dyes could anchor on the Lewis acid sites of the TiO2 surface through the bipyridine anchoring group, and the bidentate configuration was conducive for improving the electron injection efficiency and enhancing the dye adsorption stability. In addition, since phenothiazine and carbazole are often used as electron donors in DSSCs, in this work, we also compared their different effects on the photoelectric properties in detail. The DSSC based on S1 showed PCE of 4.39% under AM 1.5G irradiation and Voc of 708 mV, Jsc of 9.39 mA cm−2, and FF of 65.99%, while the DSSC based on S2 showed PCE of 2.96%; the main reason for these results is that their Voc and Jsc values were very different. We also studied the dye loading amounts, optical properties, electrochemical properties, and photovoltaic performances to analyze the differences between the two devices.
Introduction
With the depletion of oil and other resources in the world, it is urgent to research and develop new clean energy sources. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as a promising photovoltaic technology have received widespread attention due to their advantages such as a simple fabrication process, low cost, abundant sources of raw materials, multi-color transparency and high photoelectric conversion efficiency.1–3 DSSC is mainly composed of four parts: a photoanode, sensitizer, electrolyte and counter electrode.4–6 So far, a large number of excellent dyes have been successfully developed, and they mainly include ruthenium complexes, metalloporphyrins and metal-free organic dyes.7–11 In 2013, the zinc-porphyrin dye SM315 was prepared by M. Grätzel and co-workers, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the corresponding device reached up to 13% with a cobalt-based redox electrolyte.12 In 2014, T. Yano and co-workers synthesized the carbazole metal-free organic dye ADEKA-1; the device showed high PCE of 14.3%, which is also the highest value reported so far.13
Although metal complex dyes have high conversion efficiency and good stability, the high price and complex synthesis process limit their large-scale applications. In contrast, metal-free organic dyes have many advantages; these include high molar extinction coefficients and easily controllable molecular structures, and they have also attracted increasing attention of researchers. On screening a large number of structural dyes, the superiority of the D–π–A structure has been gradually recognized; particularly, the structure has efficient intra-molecular charge transfer (ICT) properties.14–18 Researchers have also developed many new structures such as D–A–π–A, D–π–(A)n, D–D–π–A, and D–π–A–π–A.19–22 Especially for D–A–π–A, the introduction of novel narrow-bandgap groups such as benzothiadiazole, pyrrolidone and other analogues greatly improves the spectral response of dye molecules and the short-circuit current of devices.23,24 Zhu and co-workers prepared an organic dye YA422, and PCE of the device reached up to 10.65%.25 Wang and co-workers synthesized the perylene dyes C275 and C281; the PCE values of the devices reached 12.5% and 13.0%, respectively.26,27 After years of research, many excellent donors such as aromatic amines, indolines, carbazoles, phenothiazines, coumarin, and fluorenes have been developed and the acceptors usually contain carboxyl, cyanoacrylic acid, phosphoric acid, rhodanic acid, pyridine and other groups.28–31 In addition, anchoring groups play a very important role in the D–π–A structures because they determine the charge injection efficiency and the bonding degree between the sensitizer and the semiconductor surface. Generally speaking, carboxylic acid is the most commonly used anchoring group since it has good charge injection efficiency and good electron coupling between dyes and semiconductors; however, under the conditions of continuous illumination or the presence of water molecules, carboxyl groups are readily desorbed from the semiconductor surface, which will greatly reduce the dye loading amount and damage the overall performance of devices.32,33 Many researchers have also tried to develop new anchoring groups such as pyridine, phosphoric acid, hydroxamic acid, and catechol to solve this problem.34,35 Dai and co-workers prepared a triphenylamine dye HY-4 with a hydantoin anchor, and the DSSC based on HY-4 showed high PCE of 8.32% and long-term durability.36 Kimura and co-workers prepared a zinc phthalocyanine dye PcS23 with a pyridine anchor, and the device showed PCE of 6.1%.37
Based on this, we also focused on the development of new and efficient anchoring groups. Carboxyl anchor is vulnerable to degradation under the conditions of water, and this will affect the performance of the device. Some studies have shown that pyridine can replace the carboxyl groups.38,39 For example, Y. Harima compared the differences between the two groups in detail and prepared a series of parallel NI dyes. The result indicated that the formation of strong coordinate bonding between the pyridine ring of the dyes NI3 and NI4 and the Lewis acid sites on the TiO2 surface led to efficient electron injection owing to good electronic communication rather than the formation of ester linkage between the dyes NI1 and NI2 and the Brønsted acid sites on the TiO2 surface.40 In addition, dyes with two or multiple anchor groups can provide more efficient electron extraction paths than those with a single anchor; therefore, this is conducive to improving their photocurrent and stability.41 Pyridine is often adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites of titanium dioxide via its nitrogen atom, which indicates that pyridine anchors have better stability.42 In this work, we used phenothiazine and carbazole as the electron donors and bipyridine anchoring groups were introduced on the acceptors to construct 2D–π–2A-type dyes S1 and S2 (Fig. 1). The DSSC based on S1 showed PCE of 4.39% under AM 1.5G irradiation with Voc of 708 mV, Jsc of 9.39 mA cm−2, and FF of 65.99%; the DSSC based on S2 showed PCE of 2.96% with Voc of 664 mV, Jsc of 6.80 mA cm−2, and FF of 65.35%. We also studied the dye loading amounts, optical properties, electrochemical properties, and photovoltaic performances to analyze the differences between the two devices.

Experimental
General information
All solvents were treated by standard methods before use, and all chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification unless indicated otherwise. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were dried and distilled from CaH2. The 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DRX NMR spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard.
Synthesis of dyes
The synthetic routes of S1 and S2 are depicted in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The synthesis details and characterization data are shown in the ESI.†
Fabrication of DSSCs
The working electrode (active area is 0.196 cm2) was prepared by screen printing the TiO2 paste on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plates (15 Ω per square). For the preparation of DSSCs, FTO glass plates were cleaned in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 30 min for two times and then rinsed with water and ethanol. Then, the plates were immersed in 40 mM TiCl4 (aqueous) at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. The TiO2 paste formed 12 μm-thick films (particle size 20 nm, pore size 32 nm). The TiO2 films were performed using a programmed procedure: (1) 80 °C for 15 min; (2) 135 °C for 10 min; (3) 325 °C for 30 min; (4) 375 °C for 5 min; (5) 450 °C for 15 min, and (6) 500 °C for 15 min. Then, the films were treated again with TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. Next, the electrode was immersed into 0.3 mM dye (S1 or S2) solution (THF/EtOH = 1/1) for 12 h at room temperature. The working electrode and the Pt counter electrode were then sealed with a Surlyn film (25 μm) by heating the sandwich-type cell at 110 °C. The electrolyte was introduced through pre-drilled holes in the counter electrode and driven into the cell via vacuum backfilling; the holes were sealed with a Surlyn film and a thin glass (0.1 mm thickness) cover by heating. The electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 50 mM I2, 50 mM LiI, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS) in acetonitrile.
Characterizations of DSSCs
The photocurrent–voltage (I–V) curves of the DSSCs were measured on a Keithley 2400 source meter under standard global AM 1.5G solar irradiation supplied by a xenon light source (Oriel). The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the DSSCs were measured by a DC method. The light source was a 300 W xenon lamp (Oriel 6258) coupled with a flux controller to improve the stability of irradiance. The single wavelength was selected by a monochromator (Cornerstone 260 Oriel74125). Light intensity was measured by an NREL traceable Si detector (Oriel 71030NS) and the short circuit currents of the DSSCs were measured by an optical power meter (Oriel 70310).
UV-Vis spectroscopy, electrochemical properties and measurement of dye loading amounts
The UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. The cyclic voltammograms of the dyes were recorded on an IM6EX electrochemical workstation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was performed using a Chenhua CHI660D model electrochemical workstation (Shanghai). The amounts of dye loading on the TiO2 films were measured by a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. The sensitized electrodes were immersed into a 0.1 M NaOH solution in a mixed solvent (H2O/DMF = 1/1), which resulted in the desorption of each dye. The amounts of dye loading were estimated according to the following formula: C = AV/εS0, where C stands for the amounts of dye loading, A is the optical absorbance of the dye, V is the volume of desorption solution, ε is the molar extinction coefficient, and S0 is the effective area of TiO2 films.
Results and discussion
Optical properties
In order to study the optical properties of these two dyes, we measured the absorption spectra of S1 and S2 in DCM (Fig. 2a); the corresponding data are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2a, the two dyes have a major absorption band in the range of 450–550 nm, which can be attributed to their intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) property. We can see that S1 exhibits a high molar extinction coefficient (ε) in the visible absorption band, which reaches 1.54 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 493 nm. In contrast, the absorption spectrum of S2 blue-shifts by 20 nm compared to that of S1; the highest ε value of S1 is 1.65 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 473 nm. In addition, the spectral response of S1 reached about 650 nm, while the spectral response of S2 reached about 600 nm. It is obvious that S2 has better light-harvesting ability, which can be attributed to the better electron-donating properties and the highly conjugated structure of phenothiazine.

We further measured the absorption spectra of the two dyes anchored on 12 μm TiO2 films (Fig. 2b). From Fig. 2b, it is clear that the absorption spectra have changed significantly compared with those of S1 and S2 in DCM; they all become broader and higher, and their spectral response range is broadened. The spectral response of S1 reached about 700 nm, and the spectral response of S2 reached about 650 nm. In the structural design of the dyes, two electron donors and long carbon chains were introduced to suppress dye aggregation. Although their absorption spectra slightly blue-shifted after anchoring on TiO2, the results showed that H-type aggregation might be insignificant and the strategy also yielded good results.43 This indicated that the light-harvesting ability of the dyes improved greatly after anchoring on TiO2, thereby improving Jsc of DSSCs. Moreover, the results indicated that the absorption spectrum of S1 was much better than that of S2. This may be attributed to the difference in the dye loading amounts. In order to analyze the differences between their absorption spectra further, the dye loading amounts were measured. As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), the dye loading amount of S1 is about 3.45 × 10−7 mol cm−2 and the dye loading amount of S2 is about 1.18 × 10−7 mol cm−2. The large loading amount of S1 can improve the light-harvesting ability of the device well. In addition, this can prevent I3− of the electrolyte from penetrating into TiO2; thus, the charge recombination rate may be reduced.
Electrochemical studies
Energy level matching is an important criterion in dye design. We performed cyclic voltammetry of the two dyes to study the thermodynamic driving force of electron injection from the photoexcited dyes to the conduction band of TiO2 (Fig. S1, ESI†) as well as dye regeneration by I−/I3−.44,45 As shown in Fig. 3, the ground state oxidation potentials (EOX) of S1 and S2 are 0.96 V and 1.02 V (versus NHE), respectively. The redox potential of the I−/I3− couple was 0.4 V, while the EOX values of the two dyes were more positive than 0.4 V, which indicated that the oxidized dyes can be effectively recycled. The zero–zero excitation energy (E0–0) could be estimated from their absorption spectra, and the values for S1 and S2 were 1.90 eV and 2.06 eV, respectively. Thus, the excited oxidation potentials (EOX*) of S1 and S2 were −0.94 V and −1.04 V, respectively. They were negative than the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V versus NHE), which indicated that electrons from the two excited dyes can be efficiently injected into the conduction band of TiO2.

FTIR spectral analysis
Generally speaking, carboxyl anchoring groups will be adsorbed at the Brønsted acid sites on the TiO2 surface via dehydration reactions, while pyridine anchoring groups will be adsorbed at the Lewis acid sites on the TiO2 surface. In order to investigate the adsorption states of the two dyes on TiO2 films, we measured the FTIR spectra of the dye powders and the dyes adsorbed on TiO2 films (Fig. S2, EIS†). Take S1 as an example, for the powder of S1, the characteristic stretching bands for CN or CC were observed at 1600 cm−1, 1574 cm−1, 1470 cm−1 and 1454 cm−1. After anchoring on the TiO2 surface, a new band appeared at 1630 cm−1, which could be assigned to pyridine anchors coordinated to the Lewis acid sites on the TiO2 surface.46,47
Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
In order to study the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs based on these dyes, the photocurrent density-photovoltage curves of the DSSCs (Fig. 4) under the same conditions were measured. The photovoltaic parameters are given in Table 1. The DSSC based on S1 exhibited PCE of 4.39% with Voc of 708 mV, Jsc of 9.39 mA cm−2, and FF of 65.99%. Obviously, the performance of the S1-based device was superior to that of the S2-based device; the DSSC based on S2 exhibited PCE of 2.96% with Voc of 664 mV, Jsc of 6.80 mA cm−2, and FF of 65.35%. Compared with carbazole, phenothiazine exhibited better electron donation and conjugation properties. Previous absorption spectroscopic studies also show that S1 has better light-harvesting ability, which is conducive to increasing Jsc of the corresponding DSSCs. As expected, Jsc of S1 significantly enhanced by 2.59 mA cm−2 compared to that of S2. Furthermore, the dye loading amount also has a great influence on the light-harvesting ability of a device. Therefore, the dye loading amounts of S1 and S2 were also measured, and the value of S1 (3.45 × 10−7 mol cm−2) was much higher than that of S2 (1.18 × 10−7 mol cm−2). The higher dye loading amount of S1 can improve the spectral response, which will improve the light-harvesting capability of the devices; furthermore, the close alignment of dyes can effectively prevent I3− of the electrolyte from penetrating into the TiO2 surface, thereby reducing charge recombination. This may be another important reason for high Jsc of S1. Besides, Voc of S1 was 708 mV, which was much higher than that of S2 (664 mV). These observations indicate that dye S1 may be favorable for suppressing the aggregation effect and reducing charge recombination, which was further investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

To further analyze the differences between Jsc values, the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of DSSCs were measured (Fig. 4b). From Fig. 4b, we can see that the IPCE curve of S1 is higher and broader than that of S2. S1 exhibits photocurrent generation up to about 670 nm and S2 exhibits photocurrent generation up to about 620 nm. We can see that the response ranges of photocurrents are consistent with their absorption spectra. From the absorption spectra of the two dyes, we infer that S1 has better light-harvesting ability. Indeed, for S1, the IPCE value of S1 exceeded 40% from 420 nm to 520 nm and reached 51.7% at 480 nm, while the maximum value of S2 was only 42.9% at 467 nm; this trend was consistent with their Jsc values.
The size of the active area for each cell is 0.196 cm2; all DSSCs were measured under standard global AM 1.5G solar irradiation.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an important tool for DSSCs, and many researchers often use it to investigate the interfacial electron recombination process under dark conditions due to its great influence on Voc.48–50 Herein, EIS was performed to study the electron recombination dynamics under dark; the applied voltage was −0.7 V and scanning was conducted from 105 to 1 Hz. As shown in Fig. 5a, two semicircles can be found; the small semicircle indicates the transport resistance at the Pt/electrolyte interface and the large semicircle represents the charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. It is clear that the radius of the large semicircle of S1 is larger than that of S2, which indicates that S1 effectively reduces the electron recombination rate; this is conducive for improving Voc. This result is in agreement with Voc of DSSCs. Besides, the electron lifetimes were further measured by bode phase plots (Fig. 5b). A longer electron lifetime represents a lower dark current, which is beneficial to improve Voc. The peak frequency (f) at the lower frequency region was obtained from the bode phase plots and the electron lifetime (τ) can be calculated by τ = 1/(2πf). The f values of S1 and S2 were 16.9 and 21.5 Hz, respectively. Thus, the corresponding electron lifetime values of S1 and S2 were 9.42 and 7.40 ms, respectively; the trend was also consistent with Voc of DSSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, we prepared two new 2D–π–2A-type metal-free organic dyes S1 and S2 and applied them in DSSCs. Phenothiazine and carbazole groups were used as electron donors, and bipyridine anchoring groups were introduced on the acceptors to construct 2D–π–2A-type structures. The results indicated that the two dyes could anchor on the Lewis acid sites of the TiO2 surface through the bipyridine anchoring groups, and the bidentate configuration was conducive for improving the electron injection efficiency and dye adsorption stability. The DSSC based on S1 showed PCE of 4.39% under AM 1.5G irradiation with Voc of 708 mV, Jsc of 9.39 mA cm−2, and FF of 65.99%. These results indicate that the performance of DSSCs can be improved by developing more efficient anchoring groups.
