    , Accepted 26th April 2016First published on 26th April 2016AbstractIn this study, grafted sulfonated-acetone–formaldehyde lignin (GSL) was prepared via graft sulfonation using alkali lignin from pulping black liquor as a raw material and studied by GPC, functional group content measurement and FTIR to confirm its fundamental structure. Unexpected cluster-induced green fluorescent emission of sulfonated-acetone–formaldehyde polymer in GSL, an unconventional chromophore, was investigated for the first time. Moreover, inspired by the phenolic hydroxyl group of GSL, we studied the electron transfer process during the oxidation of GSL by cyclic voltammetry and hole transporting mobility test. Electrochemical behaviour test showed an oxidation potential at 1.1 V. Moreover, a hole mobility of 2.27 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 was detected with GSL as the hole transport material. The results reveal that GSL is a potential water soluble polymeric p-type semiconductor. Taking advantage of the hole transporting property of GSL, PEDOT:GSLs with controllable work functions were developed and applied as hole transport layers (HTLs) in organic electronic devices, including organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). As a result, a maximum power efficiency of 14.67 lm W−1 was achieved with PEDOT:GSL-1:6 as HTL in OLEDs, which was 1.78 times that with PEDOT:PSS (8.25 lm W−1). Moreover, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.47% using PEDOT:GSL-1:4 as HTL was achieved in the OPV devices structure of ITO/HTL/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/PFN/Al. These results show that amorphous polymer GSL might be a potential dopant of PEDOT in organic electronic devices and it provides a novel perspective to adjust the work function of PEDOT by doping with sulfonated lignin, which is a cheap and renewable biomass.
Introduction
Interface engineering is of critical importance to improve the performance of organic electronic devices, including organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),1 organic solar cells (OSCs),2 and polymer solar cells (PSCs).3 One critical interface in these devices is the anode interface at which hole injection and hole extraction occurred for light emitting devices and photovoltaic devices, respectively. Typically, ohmic contact at the anode is required for optimized devices and this can be achieved by inserting a hole conducting polymer that can modify the work function of the transparent electrode (such as ITO) to achieve energy level matching with the active layer. Poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) is the most widely used commercially available water soluble conductive polymer used as an anode interlayer for high performance organic electronic devices. The PSS dopes PEDOT through protonic acid doping and PSS acts as a polyanion to stabilize the p-doped PEDOT. It is well known that the electronic and electrical properties of PEDOT:PSS are strongly dependent on the microstructure, crystallinity and content ratio of PEDOT and PSS.4 Therefore, the structure–property relationship in the PEDOT:PSS system has been studied extensively. There are several strategies developed to alter the electrical and electronic properties of PEDOT:PSS films such as solvent treatment5 or the introduction of perfluorinated ionomer.6 However, there were very few studies aiming to produce better conducting PEDOT by replacing PSS with new dopants except for our recent reports such as lignosulfonate7 and sulfonated phenol–formaldehyde resin.8 Herein, grafted sulfonated-acetone–formaldehyde lignin (GSL), which is an abundant and sustainable bio-derived polymer, was introduced as an efficient dopant and stabilizer to produce PEDOT:GSL aqueous dispersions and films with tunable work functions and conductivities. The underlying doping mechanism and the key factors that determine the properties of the PEDOT:GSL films were also investigated. The novel PEDOT:GSL films were then applied to fabricate both OLEDs and PSCs with good performance comparable to or even outperforming those based on commercial PEDOT:PSS. In addition, compared to the previous polymer LS,7b GSL has three advantages. (1) GSL has a very different chemical structure from LS. It has more phenolic group content, which could lead to the better oxidative activity. (2) The sulfonic degree of GSL is far higher than that of LS, which makes GSL exhibit an excellent dispersion property for PEDOT dispersion. (3) Based on the excellent dispersion property of GSL, the film-forming properties of PEDOT:GSLs are better than those of PEDOT:LSs. All these differences contribute to the good performance of PEDOT:GSL as HTL in organic electronics.
After cellulose, lignin, as one of the most abundant biopolymers and the main developable renewable resource based on rich aromatic units, has attracted increasing attention from chemical and materials science society.9 Most native lignin exists in the middle lamella between the secondary cell wall and wood cells. Thus, lignin plays a vital role in strengthening the cell walls and protecting plants against biochemical attack as it is a stable native polymer. It must be noted that due to the aromatic structure and electron transfer property of lignin,7 it can act as a transfer mediate for the conversion of photon and energy during the growth of plants. More than 70 million tons of industrial lignin is produced as by-product during the processes of biomass separation each year. Approximately 95% of the resultant lignin is burned because of its good combustion value, and the rest of the industrial lignin is applied for low value products such as cheap additives, binders, dispersants and surfactants. Therefore, the development of high end value-added application of lignin is of high potential commercial value.
It is well known that poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) plays an indispensable role as hole transport layer (HTL) for different organic electronic devices.10 However, PEDOT:PSS still has several drawbacks, including (1) large electrical and microstructural inhomogeneity, leading to widely varying conductivities and morphologies across the film surface; and (2) the acidic nature (pH ∼ 1) originating from the PSSH dopant in PEDOT:PSS induces erosion of the underlying ITO,11 making PEDOT:PSS as an undesired choice of HTL. In principle, the two deficiencies should be addressed using more suitable alternatives.
Herein, we explore GSL as a dopant to replace PSS as a conducting PEDOT material. The motivation for such concept is on the base of the following considerations.
First, sulfonated acetone–formaldehyde (SAF) (see Fig. 1b), as an excellent dispersant in various industrial fields,12 was introduced in the lignin molecule to obtain grafted sulfonated-acetone–formaldehyde lignin (GSL) in our study.13 Therefore, GSL polymer is a relatively low cost and high performance resin. Due to the long aliphatic chain with plenty sulfonic groups, GSL has been studied and applied as a cement water reducing agent and superplasticizer in our previous study.13 Moreover, GSL also showed good dispersion property for PEDOT in our study, so the motivation for high value application of GSL is possible. Second, lignin, as one of the most abundant biomass resources, has three types of phenol derivatives, including p-coumaryl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol,9 and these phenol derivatives could be oxidized into radical or radical cation.7,14 The old chemistry also reported that lignin and lignosulfonate could be converted to the phenolic oxidized state with radicals, which could be tested by electron spin resonance (ESR).15 Electron transfer process accompanied by oxidation makes lignin act as a potential hole transport material in organic electronic devices.

Inspired by the ideas mentioned above, grafted sulfonated-acetone–formaldehyde lignin (GSL) was prepared via graft sulfonation using alkali lignin from pulping black liquor as a raw material and studied by GPC, functional group content measurements and FTIR to confirm its fundamental structure. An electrochemical behaviour test showed that the oxidation potential at 1.1 V was observed at the GSL modified electrode, and an unexpected hole mobility of 2.27 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved on using GSL as a hole transport material. The results show that GSL is a potential water soluble polymeric p-type semiconductor. Taking advantage of the hole transporting property of GSL, PEDOT:GSLs with controllable work functions were developed and applied as a hole transport layer (HTL) in organic electronic devices, including OLEDs and OPVs. As a result, the maximum CE of 26.56 cd A−1 achieved from PEDOT:GSL-1:6 as HTL in OLEDs is higher than that of PEDOT:PSS (25.09 cd A−1), and the maximum PE of 14.67 lm W−1 is even 1.78-fold of PEDOT:PSS (8.25 lm W−1). Moreover, a very high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.47% from PEDOT:GSL-1:4 was achieved with the OPV device structure of ITO/HTL/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/PFN/Al in the present study.
Results and discussion
Preparation and characterization of GSL polymer
In our study, a water-soluble GSL polymer was synthesized via the graft sulfonation of alkali lignin (AL) using sodium sulfite, acetone and formaldehyde as raw materials (see Fig. 1a). The molecular weight (Mw) and fundamental structural properties of the raw material, AL and GSL were investigated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), functional group content measurements and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), respectively. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), a significant increase in Mw was achieved through the introduction of SAF condensate to the AL molecule by graft sulfonation. The results of the Mw distribution of AL and GSL are also listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The Mw of GSL (Mw = 24900 Da, Mw/Mn = 2.74) increased significantly with a factor of 12-fold compared to that of AL (Mw = 2100 Da, Mw/Mn = 1.91).
To characterize the effect of graft-sulfonation on the water-solubility of GSL, the functional group content, including phenolic hydroxyl group and sulfonic group, were investigated. As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), the sulfonic group content of 2.54 mmol g−1 was detected from the GSL sample. However, in our previous study, the sulfonic group content of 1.77 mmol g−1 was achieved by the conventional sulfomethylation of lignin.16 The result indicates that graft-sulfonation is an efficient way to improve Mw, sulfonation degree and water-solubility of lignin.
To further elucidate the chemical structure of the GSL polymer, FT-IR spectra of AL and GSL were obtained (see Fig. S2, ESI†). The signals of the bands at 3446 cm−1 and 3420 cm−1 correspond to the stretching vibrations of phenolic and aliphatic hydroxyl groups from AL and GSL, respectively. The band at 1700 cm−1 corresponds to non-conjugated carbonyl group stretching vibration. The strong absorbance band at 1640 cm−1 is ascribed to the stretch of CO. More importantly, compared with raw material AL, the strong absorbance of S–O and SO stretching vibrations at 1184 cm−1 and 1042 cm−1 was observed from the GSL sample. This further indicates that graft-sulfonation is an efficient way to increase the sulfonic groups of lignin. The band at 510 cm−1 is ascribed to the C–O–C stretching vibrations of GSL.
Unconventional green fluorescence emission of GSL
More interestingly, the photoluminescence of this old polymer has been ignored and is reported by us for the first time. The non-conjugated long aliphatic chain structure of SAF has been reported in previous studies.12 The mechanism for its fluorescence emission is very specific compared to the traditional conjugated structure of numerous semi-conductive polymers. In this study, the UV-vis adsorption spectrum and fluorescence spectrum of GSL aqueous solution were investigated. Energy band gap (EgAL = 2.92 eV, EgGSL = 2.61 eV) was calculated from UV-vis adsorption spectra of AL and GSL dilute aqueous solutions (see Fig. 2a). In Fig. 2b, green fluorescent emission was observed from SAF and GSL in solution via UV-irradiation. The fluorescence spectra of AL, GSL and SAF aqueous solutions are also shown in Fig. 2b. It is clear that the fluorescence of AL is the blue emission of 418 nm. The fluorescent emission wavelengths of GSL and SAF were 510 nm and 530 nm, respectively. This indicates that the fluorescent emission of GSL originated from SAF.

The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQYs) of GSL was also measured. The PLQY value calculated with eqn (2) (as shown in Experimental section) is 8.5%. This phenomenon is proposed to be the emission from nonconventional and non-conjugated system of SAF,17 which is rarely reported. Therefore, the mechanism of luminescence is proposed as cluster-induced emission, as shown in Fig. 3. The cluster formation of carbonyl groups and the hydrogen-bond interaction from hydroxyl group and sulfonic acid group of SAF produced the fluorescent emission of SAF and GSL.

Luminescent materials have gained an upsurge in research interest over the past decades due to their promising application in organic electronics.18 Compared to the traditional aggregation-induced emission (AIE) or aggregation-enhanced emission (AEE) materials, there are numerous advantages of SAF and GSL: (1) the raw materials are cheaper and widely accessible, (2) the synthesis process is very simple, and (3) GSL can be prepared by an organic solvent-free route. Our result indicates that the application of SAF and GSL can be explored further in the areas of fluorescent materials such as fluorescence probe and bioimaging reagent.
Electron transfer property and hole mobility of GSL
To evaluate the electronic and electrical properties of GSL, cyclic voltammetry was performed and the hole transporting property was measured. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was applied to study the oxidative activity of GSL. The CV of GSL film in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 (in dichloromethane) solution was used to investigate the electrochemical behavior of GSL (see Fig. 2c). An irreversible oxidation peak at 1.1 V was observed at the GSL modified electrode. This means that the HOMO energy level of GSL is −5.5 eV and GSL can be oxidized under a relatively low potential.7c The oxidative mechanism of GSL is proposed, as shown in Fig. 1c. The phenolic hydroxyl group of GSL could be oxidized to form a phenol radical cation in the electrochemical reaction process. The electron transfer process provides a new concept for the design of HTL molecules.
Based on the HOMO energy level of GSL, quantitative evaluation of the hole mobility of GSL was investigated by testing the J–V characteristics of hole-only devices with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/GSL(90 nm)/MoO3(10 nm)/Al.7c The observed dark current–voltage curve was then fitted using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) model (see Fig. 2d) with eqn (1) as follows: J = (9/8)εrε0μ(V2/d3)(1)where ε0 is the dielectric permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of the sample, μ is the mobility, and d is the thickness of sample. The thickness of GSL is 90 nm. As can be seen from Fig. 2d, the SCLC hole mobility value of 2.27 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 was calculated from eqn (1). The result indicates that GSL has hole transport capability, which originates from the phenolic derivative structure and this favourable charge transport characteristic makes GSL a potential good dopant of PEDOT.
Preparation and characterization of PEDOT:GSL polymer
In our previous study, GSL polymer with a high sulfonic group content exhibits good dispersion property.13 More importantly, the electron transfer property of GSL will facilitate charge transport and contribute to its outstanding potential application in organic electronics. Therefore, a PEDOT:GSL aqueous dispersion was prepared by applying GSL to disperse the conductive polymer, PEDOT, and applied as hole transport layer in organic electronics, including OLEDs and OPVs.
The structure characterizations of PEDOT:GSLs were investigated by FT-IR, UV-vis adsorption and transmittance measurements. The FT-IR spectra of EDOT and PEDOT:GSL are shown in Fig. S3a (ESI†). Compared to the EDOT monomer, the strong vibration band at 892 cm−1 from the C–H bending mode and the C–H vibration band at 2985 cm−1 and 3125 cm−1 all disappeared in the PEDOT:GSL, demonstrating the formation of PEDOT chains with α,α′-coupling. Moreover, the vibrations at 1480 cm−1 and 1360 cm−1 were ascribed to the stretching modes of CC and C–C in the thiophene ring, and the stretching vibration modes of the C–S bond in the thiophene ring can be observed at 935 cm−1 and 762 cm−1. The adsorption peaks at 1188 cm−1 and 620 cm−1 are ascribed to the stretching modes of SO bond from sulfonic groups. The result shows that PEDOT:GSL polymer has been prepared successfully.
UV-vis absorption spectra of PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:GSLs aqueous dispersions were also detected and shown in Fig. S3b (ESI†). The biopolaron absorption band at 800 nm from the UV spectra was ascribed to the π–π transition in the PEDOT polymer chain.19 Moreover, the broad absorption from 600 to 900 nm was also detected in PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:GSL aqueous dispersions. Compared with the blue colour of PEDOT:PSS dispersion, PEDOT:GSL showed dark green colour due to its different absorption.
The transmittance of the transport layer could affect the performance of the organic electronic devices. Thus, the transmittance spectra of PEDO:PSS film and PEDOT:GSL films were investigated in our study (see Fig. 4a). Compared to the blank glass substrate, the broad peak from 600 to 900 nm decreased in PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:GSL films, which is consistent with the UV-vis absorption results. In addition, we can find that two bumps were observed in the transmittance curves of PEDOT:GSL-1:4 and PEDOT:GSL-1:6 from 400 to 650 nm, but not for PEDOT:GSL-1:1 and PEDOT:GSL-1:2. For PEDOT:GSL-1:4 and PEDOT:GSL-1:6, high transmittance in this range is crucial for the performance of OLEDs because the range of the blue electroluminescence spectra from OLEDs is from 400 to 650 nm (see Fig. 4b).

Performance of PEDOT:GSL in organic electronic devices
To evaluate the hole transport performance of PEDOT:GSL, OLED and OPV devices with PEDOT:GSLs as an anode modifier were fabricated, respectively. The device architectures of the OLEDs and OPVs are Glass/ITO/HTL/TAPC/Mcp/Mcp:Flrpic/TmPyPb/LiF/Al and Glass/ITO/HTL/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/PFN/Al, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5a and 6a.
The J–V curve and brightness–voltage curve of the OLEDs with PEDOT:GSLs as HTLs are shown in Fig. 5b, and the current efficiency and power efficiency curves of OLEDs with PEDOT:GSLs as HTLs are also shown in Fig. 5c. Organic light emitting devices with PEDOT:PSS-4083 were also fabricated as a control device. The turn-on voltage (Von), power efficiency (PE) and current efficiency (CE) of the OLEDs are all given in Table 1. PEDOT-free showed poor performance with a CE of 16.74 cd A−1. The OLED device with PEDOT:PSS modified anode showed an improved performance with CE of 25.09 cd A−1, which is close to the result reported in the literature20 (29.70 cd A−1), as shown in Table 1. When the mass ratio of PEDOT to GSL was 1:1 and 1:2, the CEs of the corresponding devices were 4.72 cd A−1 and 12.46 cd A−1, respectively, which were both lower than that of the device based on the PEDOT-free anode. However, when PEDOT:GSL-1:4 and PEDOT:GSL-1:6 were applied, high CEs of 23.88 cd A−1 and 26.56 cd A−1 were obtained in the corresponding OLEDs. It is worth noting that PEDOT:GSL-1:6 case exhibited good performance, which was even comparable to that of PEDOT:PSS. The results showed that the efficiency increased from 1:1 to 1:6 in PEDOT:GSL, which indicates that GSL has a positive effect on the hole injection/transport properties. The results also exhibited smaller Vons from the PEDOT:GSL-based devices than that from PEDOT:PSS control device (see Table 1). Moreover, the PEmaxs of the PEDOT:GSL-1:4 and PEDOT:GSL-1:6 based devices were far higher than that of PEDOT:PSS control device. It is worth mentioning that the pH of PEDOT:PSS (1.86) exhibits strong acidity; however, the pH of PEDOT:GSLs are between 3.27 and 3.40, which is higher than that of PEDOT:PSS.

The photovoltaic performance of OPVs using PEDOT:GSLs as HTLs was also investigated. The detailed device architecture and J–V curves of the OPVs with different HTLs are shown in Fig. 6. The structure of PTB7-Th as the donor of OPVs is also given in Fig. 6a. The corresponding J–V curves of the studied devices are illustrated in Fig. 6b and the detailed photovoltaic performances are summarized in Table 2. The reference devices with none-HTL showed poor photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 1.89%. The PCE of the PSCs based on PEDOT:PSS as HTL was 8.37%, as reported in the literature21 (see Table 2). In our study, the device with PEDOT:PSS as a HTL showed a PCE of 8.39%, which is very close to the result reported in the literature.21 In addition, the PCEs of the solar cell devices with PEDOT:LS-1:27b and PEDOT:LS-1:47b were 7.09 and 7.41%, respectively. The photovoltaic performance was also improved significantly using PEDOT:GSLs as HTLs in OPVs compared to the none-HTL based devices. Moreover, similar to the trend observed in the OLED devices, at low PEDOT:GSL mass ratios, such as the cases of 1:1 and 1:2, the PCEs of the device performance was 7.57% and 7.74%, respectively. However, PEDOT:GSL-1:4 and PEDOT:GSL-1:6 films were used as the anode modifiers, leading to PCEs of 8.47% and 8.37%, respectively, which were comparable to that of PEDOT:PSS (8.39%). The results were far better than those of PEDOT:LSs. The results further indicate that GSL polymer has a positive effect on the hole transport property in organic electronic devices. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the Vocs of PEDOT:GSL-1:4 and PEDOT:GSL-1:6 were both higher than those of PEDOT:LSs. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the studied devices with PEDOT:LSs and PEDOT:GSLs were also investigated and shown in Fig. 6c. Polymer solar cells based on PEDOT:GSLs yielded broad EQE spectra from 300 to 850 nm, and the EQE of the devices with PEDOT:GSLs were higher than those of PEDOT:LSs. Overall, our results showed that GSL has potential as a dopant of PEDOT to produce an anode modifier for high performance OLEDs and OPVs.

Mechanism for improved device performance with PEDOT:GSL as HTL
Based on the highly efficient performance using PEDOT:GSLs as HTLs in organic electronic devices, we proposed the possible mechanism based on the following four aspects.
First, the hole transport nature of the GSL polymer observed in the SCLC test makes it a semi-conductive dopant of PEDOT. As a result, the conductivities of all the PEDOT:GSL films were found to be higher than that of PEDOT:PSS film (summarized in Table S2, ESI†). The improved conductivity of the HTL is an important characteristic.
Second, as can be seen from Fig. 4b by comparing the electroluminescence spectra of OLEDs with the transmittance spectra of PEDOT:GSL films, the range of emission spectra in OLED devices was from 400 nm to 650 nm, and the transmittances of PEDOT:GSL-1:4 film and PEDOT:GSL-1:6 film were relatively higher than those of PEDOT:GSL-1:1 film and PEDOT:GSL-1:2 film in this range. Therefore, OLED devices with PEDOT:GSL-1:4 and PEDOT:GSL-1:6 as the anode modifiers exhibited better EL performance. Similarly, high transmittance is also crucial for power conversion efficiency of OPVs.
Third, it is well known that film-forming property could affect the hole injection/transport properties of HTL. The particle size is crucial for the film-forming property of PEDOT:GSL, so dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements of the PEDOT:GSL aqueous dispersions and the surface morphologies of PEDOT:GSL films were investigated, as shown in Fig. 7 and 8, respectively. The trend was obvious that the particle size decreased gradually with increasing GSL dopant content, and the particle sizes of all PEDOT:GSL aqueous dispersions were smaller than that of PEDOT:PSS. This indicated that the dispersion property of GSL is excellent for PEDOT. The AFM images of the PEDOT:GSL films were also observed, as shown in Fig. 8. The surfaces of all PEDOT:GSL films were quite homogeneous. Nanoparticles were detected from the AFM image of PEDOT:GSL-1:1 (Fig. 8a), but compact and uniform films were obtained from the other three samples (Fig. 8b–d). Moreover, the RMS decreased with increasing dopant ratio. Compared to PEDOT:LS, on one hand, it further illustrates that GSL shows better dispersion property in the conducting polymer, PEDOT. On the other hand, the compact and uniform films from PEDOT:GSLs might facilitate better hole injection/extraction properties in organic electronic devices.

Finally, the match of the work function is one of the most important factors in organic electronic devices. As can be seen from Fig. 9, the work functions (WFs) of PEDOT:GSLs were obtained via ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) and calculated from the source energy and energy difference (w): E = 21.22 − w eV. The results showed that the WFs of PEDOT:PSS, PEDOT:GSL-1:2, PEDOT:GSL-1:4, and PEDOT:GSL-1:6 were 5.02, 4.92, 5.05, and 5.10 eV, respectively. We found that the high WFs could better match with the HOMO energy levels of PTB7-Th and TAPC to achieve high Voc in OPVs and lower Von in OLEDs, respectively (as illustrated in Fig. 9c and d).

In addition, to gain more insight into the thermostabilities of PEDOT:GSLs and the durability of solar cells based on PEDOT:GSLs as HTLs, the TGA of GSL polymer, PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:GSLs was tested (see Fig. 10a). The lifetime tests of solar cells based on PEDOT:PSS and PEDODT:GSLs as HTLs were also investigated (see Fig. 10b). As can be seen from Fig. 10a, when the temperature was 200 °C, the mass residue ratios of PEDOT:PSS, PEDOT:GSL-1:1, PEDOT:GSL-1:2, PEDOT:GSL-1:4, and PEDOT:GSL-1:6 were 92%, 92.5%, 91%, 90%, and 90%, respectively. Therefore, the thermostabilities of all PEDOT:GSLs were comparable to that of PEDOT:PSS. As demonstrated in Fig. 10(b), the durability test results of polymer solar cells showed that the durability of PEDOT:GSL-1:4 was better than those of the other PEDOT:GSL samples. The durability of PEDOT:PSS was better than that of PEDOT:GSL-1:4. After 480 hours, the PCE of the solar cells based on PEDOT:GSL-1:4 as a HTL was 7.0%, which was close to that of PEDOT:PSS (7.27%).

Overall, GSL, as a novel hole transport material from available renewable plant resource, might be a potential water soluble polymeric semiconductor. It showed a novel application potential as dispersant and template of PEDOT. The concept to design dopant of PEDOT provides a promising strategy to develop water soluble PEDOT-based polymers.
Conclusions
GSL was prepared by graft-sulfonation of alkali lignin and characterized by GPC, functional group content measurements and FT-IR measurements. The unexpected fluorescent emission of GSL was investigated for the first time. We studied the hole transport property of the GSL polymer with space-charge-limited current method (SCLC). An average hole mobility of 2.27 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 was estimated for GSL in hole-only devices of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/GSL/MoO3/Al, which indicates that GSL is a potential water soluble polymeric p-type semiconductor. Based on the electrochemical behavior and hole mobility, water soluble PEDOT:GSL dispersions were prepared and applied as a hole injection/extraction layer in organic electronic devices, including OLEDs and OPVs. It is worth mentioning that both PEDOT:GSL-1:4 and PEDOT:GSL-1:6 exhibited high performance in OLED and OPV devices. The underlying mechanism was investigated and discussed in detail. The thermostabilities of PEDOT:GSLs and the stability tests of the polymer solar cells with PEDOT:GSLs were also performed and evaluated. The results showed that GSL has potential as a dopant of PEDOT in organic electronics and as an alternative candidate of PSS. More importantly, PEDOT:GSL as a HTL to fabricate organic electronics will provide a starting point for further research and lead to high performance HTLs based on lignin and phenol derivatives.7,14,22
Experimental section
Materials
Alkali lignin (AL) separated from the pulping black liquor was supplied by Shuntai Co. Ltd (Shuntai, Hunan, China). All other chemicals were of analytical grade, including NaOH, 37% formaldehyde (CH2O), acetone, Na2SO3 and dichloromethane (DCM).
Preparation of grafted sulfonated-acetone-formaldehyde lignin (GSL)
Sodium sulfite was dissolved in water and then added into a reactor flask. The temperature of the solution was adjusted at 45 °C and acetone was added. After the reaction was kept at 45 °C for 30 min, AL was added into the reactor at 55 °C. The reaction was performed at 55 °C for 60 min and subsequent slow addition of formaldehyde at 70 °C for 20 min was carried out. After feeding formaldehyde, the reaction was adjusted to 95 °C and kept for 3 h. The obtained GSL condensate was applied to prepared PEDOT:GSL aqueous dispersion, and a fraction of GSL condensate was purified with dialysis. The purified products were then freeze-dried to obtain a black-brown solid powder sample. The powder sample was used to conduct fundamental characterization. The chemical structure of GSL is shown in Fig. 1a.
Structure characterization and fluorescent emission measurement of GSL
The Mw measurement of GSL polymer was conducted by aqueous gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and the UV absorption at 280 nm was monitored with a Waters 2487 UV detector (Waters Co, Milford, MA, USA). Polystyrene sulfonate was acted as calibration standard. A 0.10 M NaNO3 solution (pH 8.0) was used as mobile phase with a velocity of 0.50 mL min−1. Samples were dissolved and diluted into 0.3 wt% using double-distilled water and filtered by a 0.22 μm filter.
The phenolic hydroxyl group (–OH) content of AL and GSL was determined by the Folin–Ciocalteu (FC) method. The sulfonic group (–SO3H) content of GSL was measured by automatic potentiometric titration (Type 809 Titrando, Metrohm Crop., Switzerland).
Fourier transform infrared spectrometry of Auto system XL/I-series/Spectrum2000 (Thermo Nicolet Co., Madison, WI, USA) was used for infrared spectrum analysis and recorded between 4000 and 400 cm−1. The measurement method was KBr pellet technique.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of AL and GSL aqueous solutions were measured using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer (Japan). The fluorescence spectra of AL, GSL and SAF aqueous solutions were measured using fluorescence spectrometer (SENS9000, Gilden Photonics). The quantum yield of GSL polymer was calculated by eqn (2) as follow: (2)
Using quinine sulfate as reference compound for fluorescence QY test and controlling the UV absorbance intensity of samples less than 0.06 in the excitation wavelength of photoluminescence. In eqn (2), “I” is the integral area of PL spectra. “A” is UV absorbance value. “η“ is the refractive index of solvent. The QY of quinine sulfate (ϕST) is 0.54 dissolved in 0.1 M H2SO4. GSL dissolved in water (refractive index of 1.333).
Cyclic voltammetry and hole mobility measurement of GSL
Cyclic voltammetry measurement was conducted as follows: a glassy carbon electrode was first polished carefully with alumina powder to a mirror finish surface and rinsed with distilled water repetitively. 10 mg GSL power sample was dissolved in 1 mL distilled water. Then, GSL polymer film was deposited at the surface of the clean glassy carbon electrode. The resulting electrode was immersed in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 DCM solutions and was stabilized in 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 DCM solutions by scanning the potential between −0.6 and +2.0 V at a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1.
The hole mobility of GSL film was measured using space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method by testing J–V characteristics of hole-only device structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS(40 nm)/GSL/MoO3(10 nm)/Al(100 nm). The film of GSL was spin-coated with concentration of 80 mg mL−1 and the solvent of GSL was deionized water.
Preparation and characterization of PEDOT:GSL polymer
A scheme for the preparation of PEDOT/GSL in the presence of GSL dopant is shown in Fig. 1d. A GSL sample (1 g, 2 g, 4 g and 6 g) was dissolved in 250 mL of distilled water, and 1 g EDOT monomer was added with a slow stirring speed for 5 min and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 2 with an aqueous HCl solution. Finally, 2 g of oxidant ammonium persulfate (APS) solution was added to the mixed solution slowly with high speed stirring. The reaction was kept at room temperature for 24 hours, and dialyzed to remove the inorganic salt. The dialysis product was used for detection through ultrasonication for 10 min. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVPAI 4083) was used for comparison.
Characterization of PEDOT/GSL: the UV-vis absorption spectra of PEDOT:GSLs aqueous dispersions were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer (Japan). The transmittance spectra of glass substrate and PEDOT:GSL films were obtained using a Shimadzu UV-2600 spectrophotometer (Japan), and the film thickness was tested by a step profiler (Dektak 150, Veeco, USA). The FT-IR spectra of EDOT monomer and PEDOT:GSL polymer were also acquired. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) of the GSL polymer and PEDOT:GSLs were also performed. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments were performed on a Zeta PALS instrument (Brookhaver, America). The pH values of PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:GSLs aqueous dispersions were detected using portable pH instruments. The sheet resistance of the PEDOT:PSS film and PEDOT:GSLs films were tested using a KDY-1 four point probe resistivity/resistance measurement system. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed using a Park XE-100 instrument in tapping mode, and the samples were prepared by spinning the PEDOT:GSLs on the ITO conductive substrate. The electronic band energy structures of the PEDOT:GSL films were analyzed via UPS spectra with a He(I) UV source (21.22 eV) in ultrahigh vacuum. The spectrometer was calibrated frequently with a clean gold foil to ensure that the work function of ca. 5.1 eV was achieved.
Fabrication and characterization of OLEDs and OPVs
Fabrication and characterization of OLEDs: OLEDs were fabricated on pre-patterned ITO substrates with a sheet resistance of 20 Ω per square. The substrates were cleaned via sonication in detergent, deionized (DI) water, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and DI water followed by UV ozone treatment. The devices were fabricated by spin coating the PEDOT:GSLs (∼35 nm) layer on an ITO glass substrate. The film was then baked at 120 °C to evaporate the solvent. The layers serve as the HTL to facilitate better hole injection. All other layers were vacuum deposited at a pressure of 5 × 10−4 Pa. 4,4′-Cyclohexylidenebis[N,N-bis(4-methylphenyl)aniline] (TAPC) (30 nm) was used as a hole transport material and 1,3-bis(N-carbazolyl)benzene (Mcp) (8 nm) was used as an exciton blocking material. Mcp (25 nm) doped with 10% bis[2-(4,6-difluorophenyl)pyridinato-C2,N](picolinato)iridium(III) (FIrpic) was used as the emitting layer (EML). 1,3,5-Tri[(3-pyridyl)-phen-3-yl]benzene (TmPyPb) (35 nm) is used as a hole blocker/electron transporting layer (ETL). The cathode consisted of a 1 nm thick layer of LiF followed by a 100 nm thick Al.
Fabrication and characterization of OPVs: ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by sonication in acetone, detergent, deionized water, and isopropyl alcohol and dried in a nitrogen stream, followed by an oxygen plasma treatment. To fabricate the photovoltaic devices, a thin hole-transportation layer (ca. 40 nm) of PEDOT:LSs and PEDOT:GSLs (filtered at 0.45 μm) was spin-cast on the pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates and dried at 100 °C for 10 min under ambient conditions. The active layer PTB7-Th:PC71BM (10:15 mg mL−1) was prepared by spin-coating a mixed solvent of chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodoctane (CB:DIO = 97:3, v/v) at 1400 rpm for 40 s. The thickness of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM layer was about 100 nm. After drying in a vacuum for 6 h, a poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) thin layer was spin-coated on the active layer at 2000 rpm for 40 s, from a methanol solution with concentration of 0.25 mg mL−1. A 100 nm Al electrode was thermally deposited through a mask in vacuum (<5 × 10−7 Pa). All steps except for the processing of HTMs were performed in a glove box. The effective device area was about 0.04 cm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter. The photovoltaic devices were characterized using a calibrated AM1.5 G solar simulator (Enlitech, SS-F5 117-781-007), under light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a standard single crystal Si photovoltaic cell. The lifetime tests of the solar cell devices with PEDOT:GSLs as the HTLs, including 120 hours, 240 hours, 360 hours, and 480 hours, were conducted in our study.
