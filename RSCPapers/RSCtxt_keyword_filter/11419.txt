    , Accepted 19th November 2010First published on 20th January 2011AbstractA titanium nitride (TiN)-based dye-sensitized solar cell is developed where TiN is used as a charge collector and TCO-less glass as a substrate. A nanocrystalline TiO2 film was deposited onto a TCO-less glass substrate using the radio frequency (r.f.) magnetron sputtering method and capped with a TiN film with a thickness of ∼66 to ∼167 nm, which was controlled by varying sputtering time. The crystal structure of TiN layers is analyzed using XRD, chemical bonding nature and composition (TiN0.95) were confirmed by XPS and RBS, respectively. Cross-sectional scanning electron microscopic images confirmed the columnar structure of TiN films. Electrical resistance is exponentially decayed and approaches 4.4 Ω as the TiN film thickness increases up to 167 nm. The photovoltaic property is significantly influenced by the TiN film thickness. The energy conversion efficiency increases from 3.3% to 6.8% with increasing the TiN film thickness from 66 nm to 86 nm, where an increase in fill factor from 0.33 to 0.64 is mainly responsible for the efficiency improvement. The highest efficiency of 7.4% is obtained with a 136 nm-thick TiN film and declines to 5.8% at 167 nm, resulting in a one order of magnitude retarded diffusion rate of I3−. A long-term stability test was performed for 1000 h and compared with a cell with pure Ti metal. The TiN-based cell maintains an efficiency of 84% after 1000 h, while the efficiency of the Ti-based cell is degraded by ∼34%, indicating that TiN is more stable than Ti in the TCO-less dye-sensitized solar cell.
Introduction

Dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) has been extensively studied during last two decades because it has been regarded as a promising low-cost renewable energy source.1,2 As a consequence of such great efforts, solar-to-electrical energy conversion efficiencies as high as 11% have been reported.3–6 Besides low cost, diverse applications are also expected since DSSC shows colorful and transparent characteristics.

        DSSC have typically been prepared by sandwiching two electrodes, where the negative electrode is composed of dye-coated nanocrystalline TiO2 film deposited on a transparent conducting oxide (TCO), such as FTO (fluorine-doped thin oxide), and the positive electrode consists of nanoparticulate Pt on a FTO glass. TCO acts as a charge collector in DSSC. Although this fabrication process is adopted universally, an antireflection layer may also be required to improve the light harvesting efficiency due to the fact that FTO in a FTO-coated glass reduces transmittance by 10–15%. Recently, a TCO-less DSSC structure has been proposed to utilize more incoming visible light, where plain glass was used instead of the FTO-coated glass.7–9 The TiO2 film was formed on a glass substrate without FTO, followed by deposition of Ti metal to be used as the charge collector. This FTO-less structure with a metal Ti back contact demonstrated a conversion efficiency of about 3.6%.7 An improved efficiency of about 7.1% was reported with the same structure around the same time.8
After examining all the reports on TCO-less DSSCs, we conclude that little attention has been paid to the development of charge collecting materials themselves. All the previous reports have used only Ti metal as a charge collecting material, mainly due to the Ohmic contact requirement at the TiO2/metal junction. In addition to that, the back contact Ti electrode should retain sufficient porosity for efficient dye adsorption and redox transportation, as well as a high electrical conductivity for efficient charge collection. When we deliberate on the film thickness-conductivity-porosity relationship, thicker electrode films usually has relatively higher electrical conductivity and lower porosity, leading to the opposite trend depending on film thickness. In order to fulfill all of these criteria, other research groups have undertaken complicated fabrication processes to produce porous thick (several hundred nm) Ti films. Hayase research group9 utilized tetrapod-shaped ZnO to develop the thick and porous Ti layers on the TiO2 layers, and removed the ZnO using a HCl aqueous solution. Fuku et al.8 used an E-beam method for the deposition of the Ti metal layer, to obtain a porous Ti electrode, instead of the conventional sputtering method. Regarding long term stability, although Ti metal is known to be good electrical conductor, it is also known to be liable to oxidize when it is exposed to air and/or moisture.10 This may have an adverse effect on the long-term stability, although the TCO-less metal-back-contact structure has a beneficial effect in terms of light harvesting efficiency. It is therefore required to develop back contact materials that are chemically inert and electrically conducting for the TCO-less DSSC structure.
If the electrode material has a higher conductivity than that of Ti, we do not need to construct thicker film where only small pores are likely to remain after deposition. The conductivity of Ti and TiN is reported as (1.1∼2.4) ×104 Ω−1cm−1 and 4.6 ×104 Ω−1cm−1, respectively11 and hence TiN is expected to be a good candidate as a back contact material. It is also known that the electrical conductivity of TiN depends on the composition ratio of titanium to nitrogen.12,13 Moreover, titanium alloys are well known to be corrosion resistant and chemically stable, and therefore used as a lightweight hardness abrasive material.14 Therefore, in this work, we suggest and use highly conductive TiN materials as a long-term stable collecting electrode in a TCO-less DSSC for the first time. The film thickness of the sputter titanium nitride is varied to find the optimal conditions to yield the best photovoltaic performance. Morphology, crystallinity, chemical bonding nature and composition of the titanium nitride films are investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS). The photovoltaic and electrochemical properties are studied in terms of TiN film thickness. Long-term stability tests are performed and compared to the Ti metal-based cell. Very recently, an article on TiN in solar cells was published.15 However, TiN nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanotubes were used as a counter electrode in the conventional DSSC structure, which is different from the use of TiN as a charge collecting working electrode in the TCO-less DSSC structure.
Experimental

          TiO2 film preparation
Nanocrystalline TiO2 film was first deposited on a TCO-less plain glass substrate (Quartz, JNC Ltd., NC-200). Prior to deposition of the nanocrystalline TiO2 paste, a thin underlayer was deposited on a glass substrate from 0.15 M Ti(IV) bis(acetylacetonate) diisopropoxide in 1-butanal.16 The screen-printable paste consisting of nanocrystalline TiO2 with 20 nm in diameter was prepared as described elsewhere.17. A 2 μm-thick nanocrystalline TiO2 layer was first deposited on the underlayer-coated glass substrate using the screen printable paste to improve adhesion. The adhesion layer was dried in air at ambient temperature for 10 min, which was followed by deposition of a 11.5 μm-thick nanocrystalline TiO2 layer and then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min in air. The resulting thickness was determined by a Alpha-step IQ surface profiler (KLA Tencor).
TiN film preparation
The titanium nitride back contact layer was deposited on the annealed TiO2 film by radio frequency (r.f.) magnetron sputtering of Ti target under a N2/Ar (2/98 v/v) atmosphere at ambient temperature. The base pressure in the chamber was kept below 5.0 × 10−7 Torr, and the sputter deposition was carried out under a working pressure of 0.3 mTorr at an r.f. power of 50 W. The substrate was rotated at a constant speed of 12 rpm during sputtering and the distance between the target and the substrate was 60 mm. The titanium nitride film thickness was controlled by the deposition time.
Solar cell fabrication
For dye adsorption, the titanium nitride-deposited TiO2 films were immersed in 0.5 mM solution of N719 dye (Ru[LL′(NCS)2], where L = 2,2′-bypyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid, L′ = 2,2′-bypyridyl-4,4′-ditetrabutylammonium carboxylate) in ethanol at ambient temperature for 24 h. The Pt counter electrode was prepared by spreading a drop of 7 mM solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O in 2-propanol on a FTO glass (Pilkington, 8 Ω/sq, 2.3 mm thick), followed by drying at ambient temperature and annealing at 400 °C for 20 min. The electrodes were sealed with hot melt surlyn 1702 (Dupont). The electrolyte was composed of 0.7 M 1-propyl-3-methyl imidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2 (Aldrich), 0.05 M guanidinium thiocyanate (Aldrich) and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (Aldrich) in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15 v/v, Aldrich). The active area of the dye-adsorbed TiO2 films was measured by an image analysis program equipped with a CCD camera (Moticam 1000), and the dye-adsorbed TiO2 on a glass support had an active area of about 0.5 × 0.9 cm2.
Characterization
Surface and cross-sectional morphologies of the TiN film were investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, FEI Nova NanoSEM 200) with an accelerating voltage of 10 keV. X-Ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected using a Rigaku HR X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at an operating power of 40 kV and 30 mA. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed with Al Kα radiation using a PHI 5800 ESCA System (Physical Electronics). The binding energies were corrected by reference to the C (1s) line at 284.6 eV. Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS, NEC model #6SDH-2) experiments were carried out with 3.695 MeV He2+ ion beam at a backscattering angle of 165° and the spectra were analyzed using the XRUMP software. The sheet resistance was measured using a van der Pauw method. Photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a Yamashita Denso YSS-200A solar simulator (class-A) equipped with a 1600 W xenon lamp as a light source and an AM 1.5 G filter, where the light intensity was adjusted with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-1 filter for approximating one sun light intensity. During photocurrent–voltage measurement, the DSSCs were covered with a black mask with an aperture to avoid additional light coming through lateral space.18,19 Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed using a specially designed IPCE system by PV Measurement. 75 W xenon lamp was used as the light source for a monochromatic beam and a silicon photodiode (NIST-calibrated photodiode G425) was used for calibration. IPCE values were obtained at a low chopping speed of 10 Hz and under bias light. The electrochemical impedance spectra were measured under AM 1.5 G one sun light illumination at open-circuit potential, using a Solartron 1287 potentiostat with a Solartron 1260 frequency-response detector under a frequency range from 10–2 to 106 Hz. The magnitude of the alternative signal is 10 mV. Long-term stability was performed under one sun light intensity generated from sulfur lamp for 1000 h.
Amount of adsorbed dye
The amount of dye adsorbed on the titanium nitride-deposited TiO2 films was quantitatively estimated by desorbing dye molecules from the TiO2 surface in a basic solution. The as-prepared films were immersed in the N719 dye solution for 24 h and washed with anhydrous ethanol, and then dried in a dry nitrogen flow. Then the films were immersed in a 0.1 M solution of NaOH in water–ethanol (50/50 v/v) for 24 h to remove the dye from the TiO2. The amount of the adsorbed dye was calculated from the UV-vis absorption spectra obtained using a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV/vis spectrometer.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the structure of a TCO-less dye-sensitized solar cell with titanium nitride as the charge collector. The plain glass is used as a substrate for the nanocrystalline TiO2 coating. Compared to the FTO-coated glass, the FTO-less glass shows about 10% higher transmittance, which will be better for harvesting incoming light. The thickness of titanium nitride film deposited on the annealed TiO2 layer are controlled by r.f. sputtering time ranging from 258–1290 s.

Fig. 2 shows SEM micrographs of the deposited titanium nitride films at ambient temperature from r.f. sputtering method. The grain size of titanium nitride increases with increasing the sputtering time, which at the same time leads to a decrease in the porosity.

Cross-sectional SEM images are shown in Fig. 3, where the titanium nitride layer and nanocrystalline TiO2 layer are distinct. Titanium nitride grows into columnar structure as the sputtering time increases. The columnar structure of titanium nitride films was observed by the r.f. magnetron sputter-deposition method20 and hollow cathode discharge ion plating method.21 From the cross-sectional SEM images, the titanium nitride film thicknesses are determined to be 66, 86, 109, 136 and 167 nm for sputtering times of 258, 516, 774, 1032 and 1290 s, respectively. It is found that titanium nitride film thickness is linearly proportional to the sputtering time, as shown in Fig. 3(g).

In order to investigate the crystallinity of the titanium nitride grown by sputter-deposition at ambient temperature, XRD analysis was performed. Fig. 4 shows XRD patterns for the 86 nm- and 136 nm-thick titanium nitride films. Peaks are indexed to be face-centered cubic titanium nitride (TiN) and the 2 theta angles are consistent with the JCPDS #38-1420 data and the reports published elsewhere.22,23 As the film thickness increases from 86 nm to 136 nm, the peak corresponding to (200) plane is pronounced, which means that the <200>-orientation is relatively dominant. Such a <200> oriented TiN film was found to have higher oxidation resistance than <111> oriented one.24

Fig. 5 shows Ti 2p and N 1s XPS spectra of the r.f. sputter-deposited TiN film on a glass substrate. The sample for the XPS measurement was prepared by deposition of TiN for 1548 s. For depth analysis, ion beam etching was performed on TiN film at rate of about 10 nm min−1. The binding energies for Ti 2p and N 1s peaks are consistent with those of TiN films prepared by r.f. sputtering25 and DC plasma method26 as well as the nanocryatalline TiN synthesized from hydrothermal method.27 Although the atomic concentration of the TiN film can be determined from the XPS depth profile, an RBS measurement was also performed as it provides more accurate data. Fig. 6 shows the RBS energy spectrum, from which we confirm that titanium nitride is stabilized with chemical composition of TiN0.95.

The dependence of electrical resistance on the TiN0.95 film thickness is plotted in Fig. 7. The resistance is exponentially decayed as the film thickness increases. The 66 nm-thick TiN0.95 film exhibits 34.9 ohms, which is abruptly decreased to 13.9 ohms upon increasing the film thickness to 86 nm. Further decrease in resistance is observed upon increasing the film thickness and the 167 nm-thick TiN yields a resistance of 4.4 ohms. As the electrical properties are reported to be associated with the grain size,28,29 the decreased resistance with increasing film thickness is probably due to the increased grain size as observed in the cross-sectional SEM in Fig. 3.

Photovoltaic performance is compared in terms of titanium nitride film thickness. Fig. 8(a) shows the current–voltage curves for different TiN thicknesses and photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The TiN film with a thickness of 66 nm produces a photocurrent of 12.4 mA cm−2 and a voltage of 0.8 V, indicating that TiN works as a charge collector. However, the fill factor is very poor, which results in a low conversion efficiency. Increasing the TiN thickness from 66 to 86 nm, yields a significant improvement, especially as the fill factor becomes almost doubles. As a result, the conversion efficiency of about 6.8% is achieved with a 86 nm-thick TiN film. Further improvement in conversion efficiency is observed by further increase in TiN film thickness, where the maximum efficiency of 7.4% is obtained from the 136 nm-thick TiN film. When TiN thickness increases up to 167 nm, no further increase in photovoltaic performance is observed. Both the photocurrent and fill factor decline, leading to a decrease in the conversion efficiency. Since we use the same TiO2 film thickness, we expect similar photocurrent density regardless of the TiN film thickness. However, the 167 nm-thick TiN covered TiO2 sample shows exceptionally low photocurrent density compared to all other TiN thicknesses. To address the difference in photocurrent density of 167 nm with other thicknesses, we estimate the amount of dye adsorbed on the TiO2 films, where dye adsorption was first carried out for 24 h and then dye desorption was performed in the NaOH solution for 24 h at ambient temperature. As can be seen in Table 1, the adsorbed dye concentration is almost the same for the TiN thicknesses ranging from 66 nm to 136 nm. However, the amount adsorbed is lowered for the 167 nm-thick TiN covered TiO2 film, which indicates that the 167 nm-thick TiN layer partly inhibits the penetration of dye solution. This is probably due to the fact that non porous structure is relatively pronounced at 167 nm-thick TiN film as confirmed from the surface SEM morphlogy in Fig. 2. The integrated IPCE data in Fig. 8(b) is in good agreement with the observed photocurrent density. Apart from the thickest TiN layer, IPCE spectral shapes are almost identical. The weak IPCE spectral shape at around 400–600 nm for the 167 nm-thick TiN is ascribed to the relatively low amount of the adsorbed dye.

It is observed that an increase in TiN thickness from 66 nm to 136 nm mainly affects the fill factor without noticeably changing the photocurrent density and voltage, as can be seen in Fig. 9. As the fill factor is known to be related to series resistance,30 the improved fill factor, by increasing TiN thickness, will be in related to the resistance of TiN film. The fill factors are plotted with respect to resistance of TiN film thickness, and they are found to increase linearly as the resistance decreases, except for the 167 nm-thick sample (Fig. 10). For the case of the 167 nm-thick TiN layer, however, the fill factor and open-circuit voltage are slightly lowered and the photocurrent density is significantly decreased, which leads to rather poor photovoltaic performance. As mentioned previously, the low photocurrent density for the 167 nm sample is mainly ascribed to low dye concentration. Despite the lowest resistance, the deteriorated fill factor for the 167 nm thickness may be related to total series resistance.

 Fig. 10  Dependence of the fill factor on the TiN film resistance. 
Since the fill factor in DSSCs is not solely affected by sheet resistance, other internal resistances should be taken into consideration. According to the previous report,31 there are four internal resistance elements in a typical DSSC structure, which are related to the charge transfer at the Pt counter electrode (R1 being related to arc A1 in Fig. 11), the charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (R2, arc A2 in Fig. 11), Nernstian diffusion in the electrolyte (RD, arc A3 in Fig. 11), and the sheet resistance of the charge collector, TiN in our case, (RS). Among them, series-internal resistance is a sum of R1, RD and RS, which is often interpreted as a factor affecting the photovoltaic properties of DSSCs. It is reported that the fill factor decreases when increasing the total series resistance.31–33 According to the impedance spectra in Fig. 11, an increase in the TiN thickness leads to a gradual decrease in the total resistance, except for the 167 nm thickness. In addition, the third arc, represented by A3, appears from 109 nm and becomes pronounced as the thickness increases. From the best fit with equivalent circuits presented in Fig. 11 (parameters are summarized in Table 2), the internal series resistance (RS + R1 + RD) for the 167 nm-thick TiN electrode shows almost twice as much as those for the 109- and 136-nm thick TiN electrodes. Due to the increased series resistance, the 167 nm-thick TiN electrode results in a lower fill factor despite having the lowest sheet resistance.

TiN may act as a barrier for the flow of redox species because the redox species will diffuse through the TiN layer lying between the TiO2 layer and the counter electrode. Therefore, one can expect that mass transfer of redox species may be limited by the porosity of the sputter-deposited TiN layer. We assume that the pores are much less developed in the 167 nm-thick TiN layer than those in the thinner thicknesses. This may be valid upon taking the surface morphology from SEM and the low dye adsorption into consideration. The dye adsorption abruptly decreased for the 167 nm thick sample, as mentioned previously, which is indirectly indicative of the decreased porosity. The diffusion rate of tri-iodide in the electrolyte is thus affected by the degree of TiN pore density. In Fig. 11, the third arc A3 is related to Warburg impedance, from which the diffusion coefficient of I3− can be calculated. The finite Warburg impedance (WS), which depends on the parameters, WS–R, WS–T and WS–P, accounts for the finite-length Warburg diffusion (ZD) in one dimension. In the diffusion interpretation, WS–T = l2/D, where l is the effective diffusion thickness and D is the effective diffusion coefficient of the species 34. ZD is defined as ZD = RD × [tanh (jTω)P/(jTω)P], where R, T, and P are abbreviated from WS–R, WS–T, and WS–P, respectively. The effective diffusion thickness in this study is about 31.28 μm (the real cell gap was estimated to be about 31.28 μm after hot press sealing of 60 μm-thick Surlyn, confirmed by a cross-sectional SEM). As can be seen in Table 2, the parameter of WS–T is determined to be 0.39, 0.47 and 3.18 for 109 nm-, 136 nm- and 167-nm thick TiN, respectively, resulting in a diffusion coefficient of I3−, D(I3−) = 2.53 × 10−5, 2.08 × 10−5 and 3.08 × 10−6 cm2s−1. The diffusion coefficient of the 167 nm-thick TiN is almost one order of magnitude lower than those for the 109 nm- and 136 nm-thick TiN samples, which means that diffusion of I3− in the 169 nm-thick TiN layer becomes slower. Such a decreased diffusion rate is likely to be due to the non porous structure of the thickest TiN layer, which could be one of reasons for the low photovoltaic performance.
Long-term stability tests have been performed and compared with Ti metal back contacted devices. Fig. 12 shows the change in the photovoltaic parameters with time under one sun light intensity for the 136 nm-thick TiN and the Ti back-contacted DSSCs. After exposure for 1000 h under a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 from a sulfur lamp, the open-circuit voltage remains unchanged and the fill factor is slightly improved and maintains its improved value for both TiN and Ti back-contacted DSSCs. JSC for the TiN-containing device is decreased by about 20% after 1000 h, while that for the Ti-containing one is significantly decreased by over 40%. As a result, the efficiency is decreased by 16% for TiN electrode and 34% for Ti electrode, which suggests that TiN electrode is more stable than the pure metal Ti electrode in the TCO-less DSSC structure.
 Fig. 12  A comparison of the long-term stability between TiN (closed circle) and Ti (open circle) back contact electrodes. A sulfur lamp was used as a illumination source and the measurement was performed at ambient temperature. The thickness of TiN was 136 nm and thickness of Ti metal was almost the same. 
Conclusion
We prepared a TCO-less dye-sensitized solar cell equipped with TiN as a novel charge collector and found that the sputter-deposited TiN layer worked well as a back contact electrode. The photovoltaic performance was influenced by thickness of the sputter-deposited TiN film. Sputtered TiN films with ∼100 nm thickness posses good porosity for penetration of the electrolyte and low electrical resistance under our experimental conditions. We demonstrated that such properties are desirable for the collecting electrode of a TCO-less dye-sensitized solar cell. Moreover, in comparison with a metal Ti electrode with several hundred nm thickness and poor stability against the electrolyte, the TiN film required only ∼100 nm thickness and proved to be more durable.
