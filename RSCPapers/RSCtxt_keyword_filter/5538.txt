1. Introduction
As world population and economic prosperity grow side by side, the total energy consumption is bound to increase. The present annual worldwide energy consumption is ∼15 TW (terawatts) and more than 80% of this requirement is met from non-renewable sources such as oil, coal and gas.1 By 2050, the energy demand is expected to touch 30 TW.2 Traditional non-renewable resources have a limited stock and their use for electricity production poses severe environmental issues such as emission of green house gases (e.g.CO2) and global warming.3 The risks associated with CO2 sequestration (this is an expensive endeavor and moreover, should the CO2 reservoir break and CO2 make it to the surface, this would displace all O2 because CO2 is heavier than O2)4 have again turned the attention to renewable energy. In such a scenario, generation of clean energy to satisfy the future energy demand is the need of the hour and a much talked about subject at government and scientific levels. This is also essential to sustain the social and economic development achieved during the past decades.2
Solar energy is bountiful as more solar energy strikes the earth in a day than the total energy consumption of the world in a year.5 Despite the vast availability, the energy produced from solar remains only 0.01% of the total energy demand.1,2 Tapping this clean and sustainable energy for power generation and hydrogen fuel production (hydrogen is considered as the NEW OIL for tomorrow) is the science and technology behind photovoltaics and photocatalytic water splitting. Nanomaterials with their unique physical and chemical properties offer unprecedented opportunities in tapping solar energy.6,7
Solar cells, which convert solar photons into electricity, belong to three categories. The first generation solar cells are made up of single crystal silicon (Si). Commercial modules made of Si are about 18% efficient and these dominate the markets as of now. The major limiting factor restricting the widespread use of Si solar cells is the high cost and the programs with Si solar cells now proceed with heavy government subsidies.8,9 Other disadvantages for Si solar cells are their technology- and energy-intensive production processes and the formation of harmful by-products. The second generation solar cells consisting of semiconductor thin films of cadmium telluride (CdTe) and copper indium gallium diselenide (CuInGaSe2, CIGS),10 respectively, promise a reduction in the cost, however, the toxicity of the components and their low abundance make them both less attractive and less commercially viable. The third generation solar cells consist of organic solar cells and dye/quantum dot-sensitized/organic semiconductor solar cells.11Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are sometimes included in the category of organic solar cells because of the organic nature of the sensitizer dye. Of the solar cells, fabrication of DSCs is the simplest and economical. A typical DSC consists of a mesoporous layer of a suitable metal oxide (preferably titanium dioxide, TiO2) on a conducting glass (fluorine-doped tin oxide, F-SnO2). The surface of the oxide layer is chemisorbed with a layer of an organic dye, which acts as a sensitizer. The cell is made complete by sealing against a counter electrode in the presence of an electrolyte and the electrolyte helps in regenerating the dye. Upon shining light, the excited electrons of the dye are transferred to the conduction band (CB) of the oxide layer and are taken out through an external circuit.12–14 These are illustrated in Fig. 1. Recent studies revealed that the morphology of the TiO2 in the photoanode plays a significant role in the photon absorption, electron transport and electron collection in DSCs.15–18 One-dimensional (1-D) TiO2 nanostructures have attracted the attention of scientists owing to their high surface area for the dye absorption and also enhance the light harvesting efficiency by scattering more light at the red part of the solar spectrum.19,20 Vertically oriented (with respect to the substrate) TiO2 nanostructures are fascinating from the view point of charge transport and collection.19,20 Intrinsically, electron mobilities in 1-D nanostructure were found to be several orders of magnitude higher than that in spherical particles. The present review gives a critical analysis of the synthesis and characterization of anisotropic TiO2 nano/mesostructures and their applications in DSCs.

2. Common terms used in solar cell characterization
Before going into the fabrication of solar cells methodologies, a quick look at the definitions of the common terms used in solar cell characterizations would be desired.
2.1 Current–voltage graph
The current (I)–voltage (V) graph of a conventional solar cell is depicted in Fig. 2. A photovoltaic cell functions as current source that delivers a constant current for any illumination level while the photovoltage is largely a measure of its resistance. Under illumination by a light source, the solar cell develops a photovoltage between 0 V and Voc (called open-circuit voltage), which derives a current I (as defined by the Ohm's law). A more suitable parameter is the current density, Jsc (expressed in mA cm−2). Under dark conditions (i.e. without illumination), a potential difference generates to create what is called a “dark current” (Jdark), which flows in the direction opposite to that of the photocurrent under an applied voltage. The sign convention in photovoltaics is that the photocurrent is positive and the dark current is negative. Thus the net Jsc is obtained by subtracting Jdark from the Jsc.J(V) = Jsc − Jdark (V)
2.2 Open-circuit voltage (Voc)
This refers to the maximum voltage that can be derived from a solar cell. When there is no external load connected, the potential difference shows a maximum value, which is equivalent to the Voc.
 Fig. 2  Current–voltage graph of a typical solar cell. Jsc is the current density and Voc is the open-circuit voltage. 
2.3 Fill factor (FF)
As could be seen from the I–V graph shown above, at the maximum current density (Jm) and voltage (Vm), the performance of the cell reaches a maximum. The FF is defined as: FF = JmVm/JscVoc and thus represents the “squareness” of the J–V graph.
2.4 Efficiency (η)
It is the ratio of the power density delivered to the incident power density (Ps). η = JscVoc FF/Ps. Another common means of expressing efficiency of solar cells is by Incident Monochromatic Photon-to-Current Conversion Efficiency (IPCE) or external quantum efficiency. IPCE is estimated using the following equation:IPCE = 1250 × photocurrent density (μA cm−2)/{wavelength (nm) × incident photon flux (W m−2)}
2.5 AM 1.5 spectrum
The solar cell devices meant for terrestrial applications are usually illuminated with a simulated air mass spectrum (AM 1.5). This represents the global average irradiance at the surface of the Earth (i.e. at the rate of 963 W m−2).
3. Synthesis, characterization and transport characteristics of anisotropic TiO2 nanostructures
The 1-D/anisotropic TiO2 nanostructures which are extensively used in the fabrication of DSCs as both active and scattering layers could be fabricated by several methods, the prominent being chemical approaches, template-directed approaches, and electrospinning.
3.1 Synthesized by chemical approaches
An ordered and strongly interconnected nanoscale photoanode architecture offers the potential for improved electron transport leading to higher photoefficiencies. These are supposed to shorten the electron transport pathways and enhance the accessibility of the electrodes to hole-transporting materials. One of the earliest papers describing the utility of oriented TiO2 nanostructures in DSCs was that of Adachi et al.21 One-dimensional single crystalline TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) have been synthesized as part of the strategies to increase the current density by high dye absorption and by facilitating easy electron transport through the TiO2 layer. Intercrystalline contacts could be minimized to a great extent using single crystalline TiO2 NTs with high aspect ratio. The synthesis of the nanotubes involved complexing titanium alkoxide (TIP) with acetyl acetone (ACAC) and adding the complex to an aqueous solution of laurylamine hydrochloride (LAHC) followed by heat treatment for desired periods. Fig. 3 shows the TEM images of the nanotubes produced (A and B) and the Jsc–V graph showing an efficiency of ∼5% (C). Perhaps this early research has spurred further activity into the utility of one-dimensional nanostructures in DSCs. In 2006, Grimes et al. reported the synthesis of highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays and the DSC fabrication using them.22 Synthesis of the ordered nanostructures involved radio frequency (rf) sputtering of thin titanium (Ti) foils on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) followed by anodization in the hydrogen fluoride (HF)–acetic acid (CH3COOH) mixture maintained at 5 °C. Nearly 350 nm thick TiO2 electrodes thus produced were subjected to annealing in air at 450 °C for 3 h. An SEM image of the electrode showing the morphology of TiO2 is shown in Fig. 4A. The thickness of the walls was ∼17 nm with a pore dimension of ∼46 nm. The photovoltaic (PV) response of the TiCl4 treated electrodes (of area 0.25 cm2) with the N-719 dye is shown in Fig. 4B, showing an efficiency of 2.9%. The other PV parameters were Jsc of ∼7.9 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.75 V and a FF of 0.50. These were remarkable parameters in view of the fact that the thickness of the active layer was just ∼350 nm (in comparison to the ∼10–15 μm for conventional DSCs). The open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements to investigate the recombination kinetics in the nanotube system showed superior recombination characteristics in comparison to the nanoparticles (Fig. 4C). Thus, the transport and recombination studies on the oriented NTs showed an enhanced suppression of the recombination, while maintaining a relatively smooth charge transport.21 Similar observations were aired by Frank et al.13 on TiO2 materials of thickness from 2.5–7.3 μm. A comparison of the collection (transport) time (τc) for both particle (spherical) and nanotube films (of nearly the same thickness) showed a power law-dependence (in the form of t−(1+α), where α is between 0 → 1, related to the disorder in the TiO2 films, see the intensity modulated photocurrent spectra in Fig. 5A) with light intensity (photon flux), which suggested the involvement of similar mechanistic factors governing charge transport.13 The transport times were found to be similar in both the systems (though naturally one would expect a faster transport in the nanotube system), indicating that diffusion coefficients of both morphologies were nearly the same. The comparable transport times further implied the presence of nearly the same average crystallite sizes in both. The recombination rate constants (τr = 1/2πfr, where fr is the characteristic frequency minimum of the intensity modulated photovoltage spectra, IMVS) estimated from the IMVS trace given in Fig. 5B showed an order of magnitude higher value for the NTs compared to the NPs.13 The higher value further implied the presence of fewer recombination centers in NTs. Assuming that the recombination in the NTs system is 10 times lower than the NPs and both have nearly similar transport times, the charge collection efficiency with the NTs system would be 25% higher than that of the NPs. This further implies that the NT photoanode could actually be much thicker than the NP one to have a given recombination loss, which would allow for higher loading of the dyes and higher light harvesting efficiency. A comparison of the PV properties of the two systems showed a higher Jsc with the NTs, while the Voc was nearly the same (Fig. 5C).13 The higher Jsc and τr values for the NT system naturally imply a higher Voc for the same. However, the possible higher Voc was offset because of the lower disorder induced parameter (α) of the NTs.13 In order to have the same Voc, the NT films require a larger photoelectron density than the NP films. A view of the fabricated NTs is shown in Fig. 5D.

Grätzel et al.23 utilized highly ordered TiO2 NT arrays (of 5–14 μm length) fabricated by the anodization of Ti foils in flexible DSCs (Fig. 6A–D). The NT arrays on Ti foils as photoanode and polyethylene naphthalate as counter electrodes displayed an impressive efficiency of 3.5% under AM 1.5 sunlight (Fig. 6E). The paper also reports the effect of NT length on the overall efficiency of DSCs as probed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Liu and Misra24 fabricated dye-sensitized photovoltaic wires (DPWs) using anodized Ti wires containing highly ordered arrays of TiO2 nanotubes (55 μm length). The dye-anchored NT arrays were fabricated around a Ti wire which served as the working electrode and a Pt wire acted as the counter electrode. An organic electrolyte was encapsulated in a capillary glass tube. Prototypes of DPWs fabricated by the methodology displayed an efficiency of 2.87%.

Grätzel et al.25 succeeded in fabricating dense TiO2 NT arrays (resembling a forest) by ablation of Ti target in oxygen atmosphere (Fig. 7A). Films of ∼7 μm thickness developed by this method showed a reasonable energy conversion efficiency of 4.9%. Yet another notable approach along the direction was the fabrication of hierarchical TiO2 NTs by a combination of anodization and hydrothermal processes.26 The post-hydrothermal process helped in creating advantageous roughness on the TiO2 NT surfaces. The photovoltaic performance of DSCs tested using the backside illumination mode has shown a significant energy conversion efficiency of 7.12%. When the TiO2 NTs were first treated with oxygen plasma and subsequently used in DSCs, the efficiency was increased to 7.75% as the exposure to the oxygen plasma helped in creating more hydroxyl groups (–OH) on TiO2 surfaces and hence increased dye loading (the –COOH groups of the dyes are chemisorbed on the surfaces of TiO2 through ester linkage formation with the –OH groups). A view of the TiO2 NTs and the photovoltaic performance are given in Fig. 7B and C.

          et al.27 achieved fast formation of aligned high aspect ratio TiO2 NT bundles by electrochemical anodization of Ti foils under controlled pH conditions. The NT bundles when used in the active layer showed a lower efficiency than the NPs–NTs mixtures and commercially available NPs, however the Voc followed the reverse trend. Yet another attempt along the same direction was by Lei et al.28 The DSCs fabricated out of the highly ordered 1-D TiO2 arrays by the anodization of Ti foils (∼21 μm length) exhibited an efficiency of 8.07% (front-side illumination) which was higher than that from NP DSCs of similar thickness (7.58%). Also it was found that the front-side illumination was more efficient (8.07%) than the back-side illumination (7.29%).
3.2 Organization of TiO2 on CNTs
Another way for the organization of TiO2 in 1-D manner was to coat the same on the surfaces of 1-D materials such as CNTs. The motivation for this kind of approaches was based on the following: (a) to tap the excellent electron mobility through the CNTs and hence it was expected that the photoinjected electrons in dye-anchored TiO2 may be quickly transported through the TiO2–CNT network to the collector thus minimizing recombinations, and (b) the chemical interaction between TiO2 and CNTs will further help in charge separation thus minimizing recombinations. However, this has proved to be very challenging as the commercial CNT samples are a mixture of metallic and semiconducting ones and the presence of the former is undesirable due to providing short-circuit paths.29 Several research efforts have happened in this direction and a summary is given below.
Vertically aligned CNTs were grown on FTO plates using a direct current-biased plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) system in the presence of Ni catalyst and C2H2 and NH3 as feed gases.30 The TiO2 layer is deposited on the CNTs by the metal–organic CVD (MOCVD) process of Ti(IV) isopropoxide vapor under high pressure and temperature (Fig. 8A). The DSC devices completed with N719 dye and imidazolium iodide electrolyte gave a promising overall conversion efficiency of 1.09% and a high Voc of 0.64 V. Muduli et al.31 has succeeded in organizing spherical TiO2 particles on the surfaces of functionalized MWCNTs to create wire-like anisotropic nanostructures by hydrothermal treatment. A schematic of the chemical functionalization of CNTs and their subsequent attachment with TiO2 surfaces through ester linkage is shown in Fig. 8B. A 50% enhancement in the energy conversion efficiency has been achieved (from 4.9% to 7.37%) by the incorporation of CNTs into TiO2 and the respective increase in IPCE was from 47% to 70%. Enhancement in the photoconversion efficiency due to the CNT incorporation was attributed to improved charge transport and collection in the composite. Lee et al.32 used the sol–gel route for fabricating TiO2-coated CNTs with a 1-D morphology. A view of the anisotropic TiO2-coated CNTs is shown in Fig. 8C. With the incorporation of 0.1 wt% of CNTs into the TiO2 network, Lee et al. reported an increase in conversion efficiency by 50%.

C shows yet another SEM image of the TiO2-coated MWCNTs.32 Reproduced with permission from ref. 32. Copyright 2007, Elsevier. 
A notable research effort in the direction was the success in fabricating TiO2–CNT composites using semiconducting and metallic CNTs separately by a virus mediated approach.33 Genetically modified M13 virus was used for the purpose in which the virus was first assembled on the surfaces of CNTs and subsequently TiO2 was biomineralized on them (Fig. 9A). By this process, a uniform dense coating of TiO2 on CNTs could be achieved which is otherwise difficult with the conventional surfactant-mediated approaches. Yet another positive aspect of the methodology is the avoidance of bundling of the CNTs. The resulting TiO2–CNT composites were used as photoanodes in DSCs. Fig. 9B summarizes the Jsc–V responses of the DSCs. With the incorporation of pure semiconducting CNTs, the Jsc increased by 27% whereas with the metallic CNTs, the same decreased by 20%. The Voc and FF remained unaffected in both the cases. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) showed that the diffusion coefficient increased with the incorporation of semiconducting CNTs in devices while the use of metallic ones reduced the same. It is believed that the electrons transferred from the conduction band of TiO2 to the semiconducting CNTs can be quickly transported to the collection electrodes. The metallic CNTs, on the other hand, have a continuous band structure and therefore the electrons transferred from TiO2 remain in the energy levels close to the Fermi level thus accelerating charge carrier recombinations.33

Zhang et al.34 fabricated single-wire DSCs by first oxidizing (by anodic means) a Ti foil to have a radial anchoring of anatase TiO2 NWs on the Ti surfaces and subsequently chemisorbing a monolayer of dye molecules on TiO2. A thin freestanding CNT film was casted on top of this by the CVD process. A liquid electrolyte was injected into the interior of the NT arrays by capillary suction. A schematic of the resulting DSC structure is shown in Fig. 10A. The DSC showed a nearly stable performance when illuminated from different faces and bending angles because of the presence of uniform CNT coatings (Fig. 10B).

3.3 Through titanate route
The titanate route is often followed for the fabrication of 1-D TiO2 nanorods (NRs)/nanowires (NWs) from spherical nanoparticles (NPs) after the pioneering work by Kasuga et al.35,36TiO2 NPs upon treatment with concentrated NaOH solution under hydrothermal or high temperature conditions followed by acid (HCl) or water wash result in the formation of tubular, rod or wire-like nanostructures (Fig. 11A) with high surface areas.37 The material upon high temperature sintering (>700 °C) results in anatase NTs/NWs (Fig. 11B). Ohsaki et al.38 used the same method in fabricating anatase TiO2 nanotubes of high aspect ratio and surface area from P-25 TiO2 and employed the same in DSC fabrication. Through an optimization of pH of the TiO2 paste, sintering temperature and electrolyte composition, they obtained a higher efficiency (7.1%) than the P-25 TiO2 (6.2%). The higher efficiency with the materials was attributed to the increased electron lifetime in the tubular materials. Kim et al.39 used electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of titanate NTs on FTO plates (and their subsequent conversion to TiO2) and compared the efficiency of this method vs. the conventional doctor blade deposition technique. The EPD was found to be a much better method for getting quality materials for DSCs as the material obtained by the method was found to be fully TiO2 with little or no contamination of intercalated Na and polymer impurities which were to be nearly impossible with the doctor blade technique. The DSCs fabricated with the EPD method gave a conversion efficiency of 6.71% as opposed to 0.65% with the doctor blade technique. Enache-Pommer et al.40 adopted the titanate route to get polycrystalline TiO2 NWs and studied the electron transport and recombination processes using intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy and photocurrent decay methods. The highest efficiency reported was ∼1.5% using the materials. Hsiao et al.41 prepared anatase NTs using the same route and compared the PV performance of the material with the commercial P-25. The efficiency using the titanate-derived TiO2 (single layer) was 8.9% as against 5.9% for the P-25. The efficiency was enhanced to 9.9% by using a double layered TiO2 layer. Shao et al.42 fabricated a variety of TiO2 nanostructured morphologies by controlling the reaction parameters during the action of NaOH on pure Ti foils under hydrothermal conditions. The highest efficiency reported using the thus obtained TiO2 NWs was ∼6%. Wei et al.43 fabricated anatase TiO2 nanotubesvia the titanate route and obtained surface areas as high as 117 m2 g−1 for TiO2. DSCs fabricated with the material displayed a high efficiency of 7.5%. The challenges, however, could be fabrication of a thermally stable titanate with a stable high surface area (the as-synthesized titanates have extremely high surface areas and the same is dropped by more than 1/3 during the high temperature sintering process to convert the titanate into TiO2).

Qiu et al.44 fabricated a different sized spindle-shaped TiO2 through the titanate route from P-25 by adopting a double stage autoclave process (Fig. 12). The hydrogen titanate (H2Ti3O7) obtained by the action of 10 M NaOH on P-25 was subsequently re-dispersed in a mixture of water–ethanol or water–ethylene glycol and dimethylamine. The mixture upon subsequent autoclaving at 180 °C for 10 h gave aggregates of spindle-shaped TiO2.44DSCs fabricated with the smaller-sized spindles as the active layer and larger sized ones as the scattering layer exhibited greater than 8.3% efficiency. Qu et al.45 adopted a different strategy of coating titanate-derived TiO2 nanoparticles on titanate-derived TiO2 nanotubes for enhancing the kinetic limitations associated with the nanoparticles and nanotubes in DSCs. TEM images of the particle-coated TiO2 electrodes sintered at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 13A. Experiments with systematically heated samples, however, have shown only 4.46% efficiency (Fig. 13B).

While most of the titanate-derived TiO2 research was based on spherical P-25 particles, very few investigations have been done on the action of NaOH on 1-D materials such as TiO2 nanofibers or rice grain-shaped TiO2. Action of NaOH on TiO2–SiO2 composite nanofibers and rice grain-shaped nanostructures (SiO2 is an acidic oxide which could be dissolved by NaOH and thus conversion to titanates and in-situ dissolution of SiO2 could be achieved in one-go resulting in highly porous materials)46 at slightly elevated temperatures (∼80 °C) resulted in fiber and sponge-shaped titanates with extremely high surface areas of >200 m2 g−1 (Fig. 14). The fiber backbone itself became porous whose surfaces were decorated with thorn or ribbon-like nanostructures. The high surface area titanates as such were employed in DSCs using the conventional methodology and the materials displayed an efficiency of ∼4.7%, which was quite close to that of the respective TiO2 starting materials.

3.4 Synthesized by template-directed approaches
This is yet another widely adopted methodology for the fabrication of ordered arrays of TiO2. The template-directed approach involves backfilling the nanoporous template with the material of choice and subsequently removing the template to get the desired nanostructures. The most versatile template in use for the purpose is anodized alumina which consists of cylindrical pores orienting perpendicular to the substrate and is known to provide controllable pore sizes and shape to the TiO2. The pore size and shape are controlled by varying the anodization conditions. The most common backfilling processes involve electrophoresis, electrochemical deposition and solution infiltration of which electrochemical deposition is the preferred method for getting TiO2 nanorods/nanotubes. Durstock et al.47 reported the fabrication of highly ordered TiO2 nanotubes by the above method involving anodized alumina templates and titanium isopropoxide/ethanol (3∶1 by weight) mixture as sol–gel infiltrating agent. SEM images of the highly ordered nanostructures are shown in Fig. 15A and B. The nanotubes were removed from the alumina substrate using an adhesive tape and transferred to an FTO substrate pre-coated with a thin TiO2 layer (to enhance the adhesion of the NTs) for photovoltaic applications. The adhesive tape was subsequently removed by sintering (500 °C for 30 min). The PV parameters of the ∼10 μm thick photoanodes chemisorbed with N3 dye [(cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-carboxylato)-ruthenium(II)] was a Jsc of 8.26 mA cm−2, a fill factor of 0.77, a Voc of 0.61 and an overall η of 3.5% (Fig. 15C). The IPCE of the device was ∼20% (Fig. 15D).

Another template-based approach involves creation of TiO2 nanotubes on ZnO nanowire templates.48 A ZnO template was first created on transparent conductive oxide (TCO) substrates by a seed-mediated approach. The ZnO nanowire arrays were then immersed in a solution of the titanium precursor ((NH4)2TiF6) and boric acid (H3BO3) for concomitant deposition of TiO2 and hydrolysis of ZnO. The end-closed TiO2 nanotubes were then soaked in a solution of glycerol containing HF for the end-opening process. A schematic of the synthesis process is depicted in Fig. 16. The NTs were then washed thoroughly and sintered for purity/crystallinity before being assembled into DSCs. It was confirmed through charge transport measurements that the electron recombination in NTs-based DSC is slow compared to that in NPs analogues.

Yet another template-based synthesis of anisotropic hollow TiO2 nanowires for DSCs was reported by Moser et al.49 A schematic of the synthesis procedure is shown in Fig. 17A, according to which a supersaturated solution of a titanium precursor [(NH4)2TiF6] was used to coat the surfaces of the cotton fibers. Controlled hydrolysis of the precursor solution leads to the deposition of a layer of TiO2 on fiber surfaces and subsequent burning-off the cotton fiber leads to the formation of hollow TiO2 fibers (Fig. 17B and C). DSCs (of thickness ∼9 μm) fabricated using the material showed an efficiency of 7.15% (Fig. 17D). The Jsc and the Voc of the devices were lower than that of nanoparticle-based ones (of nearly the same thickness) and this was attributed to insufficient light harvesting by the dye-anchored TiO2 films because of lower surface roughening factor and optical absorbance. Recombination dynamics probed by transient diffuse reflectance spectroscopy revealed that the recombination rate is an order of magnitude higher than the nanofiber system, indicating less trapping than that in mesoporous particle systems. The recombination and transport life time (τrec and τn, respectively) measurements indicated ∼3 times increase with the fiber structures than with the particles. The increase in τrec and τn further confirms less trapping and hence faster injection of electrons into the TiO2 fibers as well as their quick transport to the back contact.

For effective translation of the desirable properties of one-dimensionality into reality, it may be necessary to fabricate them into 3-D architectures within confined spaces.50–52 However, growing NT architectures within confined space is challenging owing to non-uniform distribution of precursors within the diffusion channels. However, this limitation was overcome by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and pulsed chemical vapor deposition (PCVD). Using the PCVD process, Shi et al.50 fabricated a 3-D TiO2 NR network in confined spaces using TiCl4 and H2O as precursors and anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) as the template. The precursors were pumped into the reaction chamber in the presence of N2 gas for an extended period which was necessary for obtaining the TiO2 NR morphology. However, the utility of the material for DSCs was not investigated by the authors. Liu et al.52 fabricated mini 3-D DSCs using ordered TiO2 (single crystalline) NT arrays by directly growing the same on spiral-shaped Ti wires via potentiostatic anodization. The design and principle of the 3-D DSC is shown and illustrated in Fig. 18. A Pt wire was put into the inner hole of the spiral photoanode and was subsequently inserted into a spiral-shaped glass tube. The electrolyte was sucked into the tube by capillary forces. The DSCs (area 0.09 cm2) showed an energy conversion efficiency of 4.1%.52

3.5 Synthesized by electrospinning method

Electrospinning is a cost-effective method for the fabrication of one-dimensional (1-D) metal, metal-oxides and polymer nanostructures in commercial scales.17 This methodology is now widely used for the fabrication of 1-D nanomaterials of metal oxides for DSCs and Li-ion batteries. A simple electrospinning setup consists of a spinneret, a high voltage power supply and a collector as shown in Fig. 19. The polymeric solution having a metal oxide precursor is loaded into a syringe and is passed through the needle at a predetermined rate using a syringe pump. The positive terminal of a high voltage power supply is applied at the needle tip and the negative terminal is connected to the collector. Electrospinning is the result of a tug of war between electrostatic and capillary forces. The charged droplets emerging from the extremely thin layer of the polymeric solution disintegrate into long tiny liquid columns while moving from one electrode to the other. The internal electric pressure arising from enormous charged particles of similar nature forces them to be stretched longitudinally and this elongation leads to a reduction in fiber radius and during this process the solvent is ejected out. The resultant nanofibers get deposited in the collector as a continuous network. The average diameters of the fibers range from several tens of nanometres to several hundred nanometres. Electrospinning has the potential to revolutionize the spinning technology. More details on electrospinning could be traced in the cited review papers.53–55
 Fig. 19  A schematic of the electrospinning process. 
One of the earliest reports on the use of electrospun TiO2 for DSCs was by Kim et al. in 2004.56 The TiO2 electrode was fabricated by directly electrospinning poly(vinyl acetate, PVAc)–Ti(IV) isopropoxide composite on FTO plates and subsequently removing the polymer by the sintering process. The sintering results in single crystalline nanorod/nanofibril structures in nanofibers (islands-in-a-sea morphology). Fig. 20A–D show SEM, TEM and SAED images of the fibril structures and the SAED reflects their single crystalline nature. The electrodes were subjected to post TiCl4 treatment before being soaked in the dye solution. The best electrodes of active area 0.16 cm2 fabricated by the methodology gave a Jsc of 11.2 mA cm−2 and an efficiency of 5% (Fig. 20E). The group has subsequently employed the same material in creating quasi-solid-state DSCs57 using highly viscous poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene)-based gel electrolytes (PVDF-HFP). Cells of 12 μm thick and 0.16 cm2 area showed an efficiency of 6.2%. The high efficiency of the cells was attributed to the combined effect of efficient penetration of the viscous dyes into the TiO2 electrodes and the better charge transportation offered by well-aligned nanorods with reduced grain boundaries. The same group further optimized the nanorod morphology and electrolyte composition for enhancing the efficiency of the DSCs.58 Unique nanorod features of ∼15 nm diameter and 60–100 nm length within nanofiber structures were created (Fig. 20F), which showed an enhanced absorption of sensitizers compared to spherical TiO2 particles (P-25). The phase segregation between TiO2 and PVAc due to their poor miscibility during solvent evaporation was attributed to the reason for the formation of the unique nanomaterials. The dye-loadings were found to be 8.59 × 10−8 mol mg−1 and 3.44 × 10−8 mol mg−1, respectively, for the nanorods and the P-25 implying the higher surface area of the former (123 m2 g−1vs. 56 m2 g−1). The efficiency of the DSCs fabricated out of the nanomaterials (TiCl4 treated) in the presence of the I3/I− liquid electrolyte containing guanidinium thiocyanate was found to be 9.5% and 6.2%, respectively. The recombination life time, τr determined using intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) using the equation: τr = πfNmin/2, where fNmin is the characteristic frequency at the minimum of the IMVS imaginary component, showed an eight times longer value for the nanorods compared to the nanoparticles. It is believed that the smooth charge transport through the relatively defect-free TiO2 nanorods (being single crystalline) with fewer grain boundaries results in fewer trapping events at particle interfaces. Kokubo et al.59 fabricated multi-core cable-like TiO2 nanofiber membranes by dispersing the titanium isopropoxide in PVAc solution in DMF followed by electrospinning and hot-pressing of the membrane at 120 °C for 15 min at various pressures. The resultant films were finally sintered at 500 °C for 1 h (Fig. 20G). The DSCs fabricated by directly electrospinning the material onto clean FTO plates (with ∼16 μm thickness and an active area of 0.25 cm2) showed an efficiency of 5.8%.

While the above mentioned efforts have utilized a nanorod/fibril morphology within the nanofiber structure, Ramakrishna et al. have used continuous TiO2 nanofibers and nanorods for DSC applications.60–62 Synthesis, characterization and optical properties of continuous TiO2 nanofibers have been investigated and the same have been used in DSCs. One of the earliest reports along the direction is the spray deposition of electrospun TiO2 nanorods for DSCs.60 The continuous TiO2 nanofibers obtained by electrospinning were ground to nanorods and spray-deposited on FTO plates after suspending in a methanol–ethanol mixture. A TiO2 sol was spin-coated on FTO plates before electrospraying for effective adhesion of the TiO2 layer. The TiO2 layer was subjected to TiCl4 treatment before soaking in the dye solution. The best DSCs (of active area ∼1 cm2 and with the N3 dye and I3/I− electrolyte) fabricated by the methodology gave an efficiency of 5.8%, and the other photovoltaic parameters being a Jsc of 13.6 mA cm−2, FF of 50.8% and a Voc of 0.84 V. The electrospun TiO2 nanorods have also been used in establishing the relationship between molecular orbital structure of dyes and conversion efficiencies in DSCs by Jose et al.61,62 Through a combination of experimental and theoretical investigations, it was concluded that the efficiency of charge injection in DSCs with different indoline dyes depends on the extent to which the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) of the dye falls on its anchoring group (the –COOH group).61,62 Recently Nair et al.63 have found a simple recipe for the fabrication of efficient DSCs using electrospun TiO2 nanorods. The nanorods obtained by mechanically grinding the nanofibers were made into a paste of right rheology necessary for doctor-blading by mixing with a sufficient amount of polyester (made by the polycondensation between ethylene glycol and citric acid in the presence of Ti(IV) ions) and subsequent sonication for ∼12 h. Without the requirement for hot pressing/TiCl4 treatments/scattering layer, the best cells (of area 0.28 cm2) fabricated by the methodology gave an efficiency of 4.3% with N3 dye and iodide electrolyte.63 The charge transport mechanism in the DSCs was analyzed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, which showed that the nanorod-based DSCs exhibited lower charge transport resistance with improved fill factor. Archana et al.64 succeeded in carefully breaking the continuous nanofibers into short aspect-ratio nanowires using sonication in the presence of weak acids such as acetic acid/mercapto acids (Fig. 21A–C). The nanowires of ∼4 μm length (aspect ratio 10∶1) showed an order of magnitude higher diffusion coefficient (10−4 cm2 s−1) compared to continuous nanofibers (10−5 cm2 s−1), as demonstrated by transient photocurrent and open-circuit voltage decay measurements (Fig. 21D). The DSCs fabricated using the material showed an efficiency of 4.26% under 1 Sun illumination. This method provided a facile route for making nanorods from continuous nanofibers.

While the above efforts utilized electrospun nanorods (of short aspect ratio), Mukherji et al. investigated the usefulness of continuous TiO2 nanofibers in DSCs.65 The TiO2–polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) composite fibers were directly spun on clean FTO plates and the polymer was removed subsequently by the sintering process. The porous randomly oriented TiO2 fibers (of 6 μm thickness on FTO) were soaked in the N3 dye solution for overnight and assembled into DSCs. The best DSCs fabricated by the methodology gave an efficiency of 4.2%. The charge transport mechanism was analyzed by electrochemical impedance and open-circuit voltage decay measurements. The electrospun TiO2 nanofibers showed a lower charge transport resistance than the conventional P-25 particles, indicating semi-directed transport through the fibers. The diffusion coefficient estimated from EIS fitting was only slightly lower than that of P-25 particles.
Nair et al. have found that TiO2 with the unique morphology of rice grains could be fabricated using electrospinning when TiO2 was spun in the presence of a chemically non-interacting polymer such as PVAc (Fig. 22A–B).66,67 The TiO2 and PVAc enjoy limited solubility and hence there will be a microscale phase separation when the solvent is evaporated during the sintering process. DSCs fabricated by directly electrospinning the material on clean FTO plates gave a record Voc of 0.96 V. To obtain this Voc, however, the morphology of TiO2 has to be of perfectly rice grain. Adoption of screen printing/doctor blading after making a paste by mixing with a polymer such as polyester or cellulose derivatives partially destroys the morphology and in such cases, the Voc drops in the range of 0.80 to 0.85 V.67 A comparison of the photovoltaic performance of the rice-shaped TiO2 with the commercially available P-25 TiO2 showed a superior performance for the former (Fig. 22C).

Upon sintering at 500 °C for 1 h, the fibers break down to rice grain-shaped nanostructures (B).66 The photovoltaic response of the DSCs is shown in the panel in (C) as probed by I–V, IPCE and impedance measurements.67 Reproduced from author's work. 
Krishnamoorthy et al.68 succeeded in fabricating vertically aligned TiO2 nanowires by first fabricating aligned nanofibers by electrospinning and subsequently erecting them into a vertical fashion by post-treatments (Fig. 23). The nanowires had an average diameter of ∼120 nm and a height of 27 μm. The photovoltaic parameters of the DSCs constructed out of the design were however not very impressive.

3.6 
          TiO2 nanofiber/nanowire–nanoparticle composites in DSCs
There were efforts in the literature to fabricate efficient DSCs using a combination of nanofiber/nanowires and nanoparticles. The idea was to combine the advantages of one-dimensionality of the nanofibers (semi-directed charge transport and better light scattering ability) and high surface areas of the nanoparticle aggregates.69,70 Studies based on DSC configurations with 5, 20, and 77 wt% (of the nanowires compared to the nanoparticles) revealed that the 5 wt% DSC showed a higher Jsc and Voc compared to the nanoparticle DSC of similar thickness and the 20 wt% one enhanced the efficiency from 6.7% to 8.6% under 1 Sun illumination (AM 1.5G).69 For the 77 wt%, the nanowire became the major component in the DSC and hence witnessed lower packing density and hence lower efficiency. Yet another attempt in the same direction was by Joshi et al.70 A photoelectrode comprising a TiO2 nanofiber–nanoparticle composite was made by dispersing the electrospun nanofibers in ethanol and subsequently adding a standard nanoparticle paste (from Solaronix Inc.). Subsequently, the mixture was sonicated to obtain a paste of necessary rheology for screen printing/doctor blading. The presence of nanofibers improved the light scattering efficiency without compromising the dye-loading parameter. The DSCs fabricated using the nanofiber–nanoparticle composite showed a 44% enhancement in the efficiency in comparison to that made from nanoparticles alone.
Yet another means to fabricate composite electrodes for DSCs is by filling the pores of hollow NTs by TiO2 particles.67 The hollow TiO2 NTs synthesized by the anodization method are subsequently treated with TiCl4 solution by the hydrothermal method so that the crystallized TiO2 NPs fill into the hollow tubes (Fig. 24). The overall conversion efficiencies could be enhanced by 152% for DSCs having 8 μm length TiO2 NTs by the pore filling strategy and this was mainly attributed to increase in dye-loading, Voc and FF.

Thus, a critical analysis of the vast number of research efforts mentioned above on the use of the 1-D nanostructures of TiO2 as photoanodes reveals that they are promising materials to improve the efficiency of DSCs due to their enhanced surface area and semi-directed electron transport from the site of electron injection to the collector electrodes. A fast electron transport may lower the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons with the positive species in the electrolyte and, therefore, can significantly suppress the interfacial charge recombination. However, reliable and scalable synthetic approaches to produce these functional 1-D nanostructures in commercial scale are still lacking which limit their widespread real applications. A summary of the synthesis of the anisotropic TiO2 nanomaterials and their photovoltaic responses are listed in Table 1.

3.7 Anisotropic TiO2 nanostructures as scattering layer in DSCs
For realization of high efficiency in DSCs, scattering of visible light by the TiO2 electrode is essential. As the working electrode usually consists of ∼12–20 nm TiO2, it remains transparent and visible light is not scattered. The incident photons that are not absorbed by the active layer are either not harvested or partially absorbed by the electrolyte material. Thus, the idea of using a scattering layer in DSCs to scatter photons and re-inject them back to the electrodes (Fig. 25A–B) was practiced based on theoretical foundations by Usami72 and other groups.73,74 A thin layer of the scattering material (which typically consists of large particles/nanostructures of TiO2) was created on top of the active layer by doctor blading/screen printing/electrospinning. When light collides with the submicron TiO2 particles/structures, it undergoes scattering (Mie scattering) which increases the path length of light in the TiO2 layer. This eventually will lead to an increase in Jsc and hence the η. Light scattering relies on the change in the refractive index of the scattering- and active-layers and is also dependent on the relative sizes of the particles in the scattering layers.72–74 Introduction of an active layer has shown to enhance the Jsc by 20% and IPCE by 20–50% (depending on spectral regions selected, large enhancements could usually be spotted in the red part of the spectrum).72–74 Further, the scattering layer can also contribute by concomitantly functioning as an effective material for dye loading. However, the lone disadvantage of the addition of a scattering layer could be the loss of transparency of the DSCs which may affect their prospects in building integrated photovoltaics (e.g.: in windows).
Various materials have been used in DSCs as scattering layer; the most commonly used one being the typically large TiO2/ZrO2 spherical particles (or a combination of them) of ∼400–1000 nm diameter fabricated by screen printing (average thickness of 4 μm).75,76 Increase in efficiencies to the tune of 20% has been observed in such cases. Koo et al.77 investigated the effect of sizes of the scattering particles on the overall efficiency of DSCs and concluded that both the 0.3 μm and 0.7 μm particles effect ∼16–18% increase in the efficiency. A similar effect was found on thicker films as well. The scattering layers promoted the quantity and wavelength of the transmitted light and the difference in reflectivity associated with the different-sized scattering particles were attributed to the observed enhancements in photovoltaic parameters. Huang et al.78 reported the fabrication of TiO2 beads as a dual function scattering material with high surface areas of 89 m2 g−1. DSCs fabricated with the material as scattering layer gave a higher conversion efficiency of 8.84% as against cells without a scattering layer (7.34%) or with a scattering layer containing ∼400 nm TiO2 particles. Shao et al.79 reported the fabrication of hollow TiO2 plates by adding Cd(OH)2 templates to an aqueous solution of (NH4)2TiF6 and H3BO3 and the shell numbers in the plates were adjusted by suitably mediating hydrolysis and deposition time. SEM and TEM images of the synthesized nanoplates and the photovoltaic performance of the DSCs employing the nanoplates as scattering layer is shown in Fig. 26.
Yoshikawa et al.80 used electrospun TiO2 nanofibers as scattering layer to the nanoparticle-based active layer in DSCs by directly electrospinning them. The average thickness of the scattering layer was 1 μm. The UV-visible spectra showed an increased light absorption due to an elongated optical path length by the red part of the incident light. Analysis of the photovoltaic characteristics has shown that while the Jsc and η increase with the introduction of the nanofiber scattering layer, Voc and FF showed a decrease. At an electrode thickness of 15.5 μm, the efficiency of the DSC devices increased from 7.47 to 8.14%. Peining Zhu et al.81 did a comparison of the scattering properties of TiO2 nanofibers and the rice grain-shaped TiO2 nanostructures on the efficiencies of DSCs; both fabricated on the active TiO2 nanoparticle layer (∼10 μm thick) by electrospinning. The average thickness of the active layers was 2 μm. A comparison of their photovoltaic performance revealed that the rice grain-like TiO2 was superior to the nanofibers in scattering light because of the single crystallinity, high surface area and compact packing of the former. The DSCs with the rice grain-like nanostructures as scattering layer resulted in a 15.7% increase in the overall efficiency as opposed to 9.63% shown by the nanofibers. A calculation on the extent of light scattering that can be produced by nanofibers of various diameters when employed in DSCs is shown in Fig. 25C. Fibers with large diameters do the job better.

4. Conclusions
The above review summarizes the application of highly- and randomly-oriented anisotropic TiO2 nanostructures in DSCs. Syntheses of the nanostructures by various methods such as chemical and template-directed approaches, organization on the surfaces of CNTs and insertion of CNTs into the TiO2 matrix, titanate route and electrospinning have been discussed in detail as also their photovoltaic parameters when used as active layers in DSCs. Important results are summarized in Table 1. A critical analysis of the relevant results revealed that the anisotropic nanostructures hold strong promise in enhancing the efficiency of DSCs through lowering of charge carrier recombinations. However, reliable and scalable synthetic methodologies for their commercial scale fabrication are still lacking which limit the scope for their real applications. The review concludes with a small section on the use of anisotropic TiO2 nanostructures as scattering layers. Development of dual function nanostructures for both light scattering and efficient chemisorption of dyes are essential to realize high efficiency DSCs. We believe that the above summary will help DSC researchers worldwide to have a right perspective on the role of 1-D nanostructures for DSCs.
