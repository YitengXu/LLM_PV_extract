Furthermore, 3.8% efficiency was reached with a 2.8 µm thin TiO2nanotube array film based on a metal free organic dye using ionic liquid electrolyte.
Introduction
The need for renewable energy technologies to face the world's increasing energy demand is now a consensual issue. The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) has attracted great interest in academic research and industrial applications due to its potential as a low cost alternative to traditional silicon solar cells. Several research groups have used TiO2nanotube (NT) arrays in DSCs using liquid electrolytes.1–6 Additionally, successful use of TiO2 NTs in polymer cells have yielded photocurrent densities as high as 12.4 mA/cm2.7 Recently we reported a flexible DSC containing TiO2 NT arrays as a photoanode and polyethylene napthalate (PEN) as a counter electrode in combination with a solvent free ionic liquid electrolyte.8 Semiconductor quantum dots have also been used as sensitizers by attaching them to the TiO2 NTs.9,10 Finally, different alloys like Ti–Fe–O and Ti–Cu–O were used to prepare NTs for splitting of water in photoelectrochemical cells.11,12
In most cases the NT arrays have been fabricated from a thick titanium film or foil, in which case the resulting NTs rest upon an underlying Ti substrate. Alternatively, arrays were also synthesized from titanium thin films sputtered onto conducting materials such as FTO glass or metal substrates before being anodized to form the NT arrays on these substrates.4,13 The TiO2 NT formation mechanism and their properties have been well described in the literature.2,14–17 While anodization is a simple and controllable process to make titania NT arrays, it is known that the properties of these arrays are dependent on pore diameter, wall thickness and length of the tubes. The geometric features of NT arrays are controlled by the nature of the electrolyte, the additives it contains, and the applied voltage. These factors have a significant influence on the growth, structure and morphology of the nanotubes.18,19
The carrier density in the NT array was found to be different when varying the electrolyte pH in an electrochemical cell.20 The kinetic properties of DSCs using NTs and nanoparticle films were compared using modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy. It was found that the transport rate was similar in both cases but charge recombination was much slower in the NT arrays. Thus electron lifetime was an order of magnitude greater than those obtained in nanoparticle-based DSCs.21 A recent study also suggested that nanotube-based DSCs would present a significantly higher charge-collection efficiency than their nanoparticle-based counterpart.22 To the best of our knowledge there was no study on the penetration by solid-state hole transport material (HTM) into TiO2 NT arrays to form a parallel interpenetrating network for electron and hole transport. Herein, we present the first successful application of TiO2 NT arrays to SSDSCs comprising a directional mesoporous structure forming charge transport channels normal to the conducting substrate.
Results and discussions

        SEM images of the TiO2 NT grown on top of the FTO glass substrate are shown in Fig. 1. From the top view, we observed the pore-diameter and a wall thickness of about 40–50 nm. The structure is rather nano-wall-like instead of discrete tubes. The TiO2 films were homogeneous across long range with a flat top layer and remained intact after annealing using the procedure described in the experimental section. By varying the parameters of anodization, we found it was possible to form separated NT arrays but the top layer wasn't as smooth. Attempts using these films were unsuccessful due to individual tube protrusions creating a shunt path that deteriorates the cell performance. A flat top layer is advantageous to ensure an effective contact between the spin coated HTM and Au.

Some preliminary photovoltaic experiments were conducted to evaluate the use of these TiO2 NT arrays as negative electrode in SSDSCs. The TiO2 NT arrays were sensitized using a high molar extinction coefficient organic dye coded as C203.23 This dye was particularly chosen for its high photon harvesting properties to counteract the effect of a lower surface area in the NT arrays when compared to mesoporous TiO2electrodes. The surface of the TiO2 NT electrode was sensitized by immersing the array into a dye solution containing 300 µM C203 and 300 µM 3a, 7a-dihydroxy-5b-cholanic acid in chlorobenzene at room temperature for 5 h. The devices were assembled using the standard SSDSCs procedures described in the literature where we spin coated a solution of spiro-MeOTAD (0.17 M in chlorobenzene with Li-TFSI and ter-butylpyridine) on dye stained TiO2 NT arrays.24 The device fabrication was completed by thermal deposition of a gold positive electrode.
The J–V curves and monochromatic incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of SSDSC are shown in Fig. 2 and 3. The short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and efficiency (n%) of SSDSCs are summarized in Table 1. In order to assess the light harvesting capacity of the TiO2 NT electrode, we compared the absorption spectrum of C203 dye adsorbed on a typical mesoporous TiO2 film and our TiO2 NT arrays. Note that both films were approximately 2.0 µm thick.

 Fig. 2  The J–V characteristics measured in the dark and under the illumination of AM 1.5 G full sunlight (100 mW cm−2) of a TiO2nanotube SSDSC with C203 dye. 
 Fig. 3  The IPCE characteristics of a TiO2nanotube SSDSC with absorbance of dye adsorbed on TiO2 film (nanotubes and nanoparticles) and the calculated and corrected LHE. 
It can be seen in Fig. 3 that the IPCE and absorption spectrum of the dye-sensitized TiO2 NT array shows the same C203 absorption features as the one obtained with the mesoporous TiO2 film. Fig. 3 also shows the relevant optical density for the NT arrays and the mesoporous films. The ratio of both was found to be about 60%. When we take into account that the dye loading on the NT array is about half of that in a mesoporous film, we believe that it is a significant result to obtain a current density of 3.30 mA/cm2 and 1.67% efficiency at full sun intensity (AM 1.5) in a 2 µm thick SSDSC. Assuming a 20% light loss from absorption and reflection from the FTO-coated substrate, one can estimate the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) using a simplified light harvesting efficiency (LHE) model (see eqn (1)). The corrected LHE for our TiO2 array is roughly 0.8 of the value given by eqn (1) and is shown in Fig. 3 as a red dashed line. LHE = 1 − 10(−A)(1)
As can be seen in Fig. 3 the measured IPCE for the NT array is about 0.8–0.9 of the corrected LHE depending on the wavelength. Indeed, we find that the IPCE is closer to the corrected LHE in the red part of the spectrum than in the blue. We believe this is due to a stronger reflection from the gold counter electrode in the red than in the blue.25 Since the dye's extinction coefficient is relatively low in this spectral region, the transmitted light is reflected back into the light harvesting NT array providing a second chance for the dye to absorb the photons which translate into an enhanced IPCE. On the other hand, there is no gold reflection in the dye absorption measurement, and accordingly the IPCE is closer to the corrected LHE in the longer wavelength region. The wave-like absorption spectra in the red region appears due to the interference from the FTO substrate.
A striking difference observed with the TiO2nanotube SSDSC is the drop of voltage compared to the normal nanocrystalline SSDSC devices (230 mV less than a nanocrystalline cell). We suspect that further optimizing blocking TiO2 under layer and sputtering parameters could mitigate this drop of Voc. In a normal solid-state device, the blocking layer is made by spray pyrolysis and seems to block the junction more effectively than the underlayer presented here.
Photovoltaic experiments were conducted using 2.8 µm thin nanotube arrays sensitized with C203 and ionic liquid as electrolyte. The devices were made using Pt/FTO glass as counter electrode and the two electrodes were separated by a 25 µm thick Surlyn hot-melt gasket and sealed up by heating. The internal space was filled with a solvent free ionic liquid based electrolyte using a vacuum back filling system. The solvent free ionic liquid electrolyte contained 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M N-butylbenzimidazole, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate in a mixture of 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide and 1-methyl-3-ethyl imidazolium tetracyanoborate, with a volume ratio of 65/35.28 The electrolyte-injecting hole made in advance by an ultrafine sandblaster on the counter electrode glass substrate was sealed with a Bynel sheet and a thin glass cover by heating.
The photocurrent action spectrum of the device is shown in Fig. 4 as an inset. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) exceeds 75% at 490 nm. As shown in Fig. 4, the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF) of the device under an irradiance of AM 1.5 G full sunlight are 7.9 mA/cm2, 677 mV and 0.693, respectively, yielding an overall conversion efficiency of 3.8%. It is remarkable to obtain such an impressive performance with a 2.8 µm thin NT array film.

In summary, we have shown that a TiO2 NT array fabricated by anodization of a sputtered Ti/TiO2 double layer film on an FTO-coated glass substrate can work efficiently in a SSDSC. This novel TiO2electrode material is well suited for inclusion in SSDSCs because of its flat and smooth top surface, a critical property that reduces chances of shunt in the cell. Even though the surface area of TiO2 NT film is shown to be lower than in a comparable mesoporous film, we have shown that this novel type of SSDSC can deliver significant performance using a dye, which exhibits a high molar extinction coefficient and IQE. Using panchromatic dyes with high molar extinction coefficients to absorb even more visible light could further increase the performance of these cells.
Experimental
Materials and methods

N-Butylbenzimidazole was synthesized as reported earlier.261-Propyl-3-methyl imidazolium iodide ionic liquid was synthesized according to the literature method and their purity was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy.271-Ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium tetracyanoborate ionic liquid was obtained as a gift from Merck, Germany. C203 dye was synthesized as reported earlier.23
The TiO2 NT arrays were synthesized on FTO-coated glass substrate by way of depositing a double-layered structure comprising a Ti metal overlayer and a TiO2 underlayer. For the ionic liquid DSC, the underlayer was made by spray pyrolysis of ethanolic solution of di-iso-propoxy titanium-bis(acetylacetone) [Ti(acac)2(i–C3H7O)2] in aerosol form. The metal overlayer was then made by conventional sputtering of a 1500 nm thick metal film from a Ti target. For the solid state DSC, the 50 nm thick TiO2 underlayer was first deposited by sputtering in a controlled O2 atmosphere whereas the Ti overlayer was sputtered after shutting off the oxidizing gas and cleaning the target by Ar+ bombardment for 5 minutes. The detailed parameters for the deposition process are listed in Table 2.

Highly ordered titania NT arrays were prepared by anodization of the Ti overlayer in a conventional two-electrode system using a platinum wire as counter electrode. The Ti overlayer was first thoroughly degreased by washing in acetone and ethanol for several minutes. No ultrasonic bath was used in order to minimize chances of delamination of the Ti/TiO2 from the conducting substrate. The distance between the working and counter electrode was kept at 3 cm. The anodization was conducted at 35 V, without ramp, in an ethylene glycol electrolyte containing water (0.25 wt.%) and NH4F (0.75 wt.%) until the homogeneous film turned transparent. After anodic oxidation, samples were rinsed with deionized water, ethanol and dried with compressed air. The as-prepared TiO2 NT-arrays were soaked in 0.04 M TiCl4 aqueous solution for 30 min at 70 °C to improve the photocurrent and photovoltaic performance of the DSCs. The TiCl4 treated TiO2nanotube samples were rinsed with deionized water and ethanol and then annealed in air at 500 °C for 3 hours (ramping rate 2 °C/min) in order to crystallize the anodized amorphous films. The sample morphology was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (FEI XLF30 SFEG).
The surface of the TiO2 NT electrode was sensitized by immersing the array into a dye solution containing 300 mM C203 and 300 mM 3a,7a-dihydroxy-5b-cholanic acid in chlorobenzene at room temperature for 5 h.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
A 450 W xenon light source (Oriel, USA) was used to give 100 mW cm−2 (the equivalent of one sun at AM 1.5) at the surface of solar cells. The spectral output of the lamp was matched in the region of 350–750 nm with the aid of a Schott KG-5 sunlight filter (Präzisions Glas & Optik GmbH, Germany) so as to reduce the mismatch between the simulated and the true solar spectrum to less than 2%. Various incident light intensities were regulated with neutral wire mesh attenuators. The current–voltage characteristics of the cell under these conditions were obtained by external potential-bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter (Keithley, USA). This process was fully automated using Wavemetrics software (http://www.wavemetrics.com/). A similar data acquisition system was used to control the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement. Under full computer control, light from a 300 W xenon lamp (ILC Technology, USA) was focused through a Gemini-180 double Monochromator (Jobin Yvon Ltd., UK) onto the photovoltaic cell under test. The monochromator was incremented through the visible spectrum to generate the IPCE (λ) as defined below. IPCE (λ) = 1240(JSC/λϕ)(2)where λ is the wavelength, JSC is short-circuit current photocurrent (mA cm−2), and ϕ is the incident radiative flux (W m−2). This curve can be derived from the measured absorption spectrum of the adsorbed photosensitizer for comparison.
