    , Accepted 24th August 2022First published on 25th August 2022AbstractA series of π-conjugated copolymers containing V-shaped electron-deficient units of triphenyleno[1,2-c:7,8-c′]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole) (TPTz) or its non-fused precursor were synthesized. Both the ring fusion in TPTz and the appropriate spacer units between TPTz and the donor unit were important for allowing the polymers to adopt a planar-zigzag shape as the stable chain conformation. The planar-zigzag shape of the polymers strongly affected their anisotropic electronic and electrical properties in thin films, and in particular, the face-on orientation increased not only the absorption coefficients but also the charge carrier generation and collection efficiency, resulting in improved photovoltaic performance in mixed bulk heterojunction films with an electron acceptor.
Introduction
π-Conjugated polymers have been attracting much attention for their promising applications as semiconductors in electronic devices, such as organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),1–5 organic solar cells (OSCs),6–10 and other optoelectronic devices.11–14 The electronic properties of polymers are closely related not only to their chemical structures, but also to their molecular shapes, conformations, and packing properties in thin films. Generally, one-dimensional elongated π-conjugation of the molecules requires planar aromatic backbones, and the face-to-face stacking of the π-conjugated planes improves the charge transport properties in thin films.15 Therefore, the most common strategy to design high-performance semiconducting polymers is to prepare planar-linear backbones with high packing density in the films. This approach has been successful for highly crystalline materials with high charge mobility in OFETs. However, for some applications, such as OSCs, the polymer materials are used in combination with other components in mixed films; therefore, tuning the polymer crystallinity and miscibility with other materials is important to achieve a high device performance.16 In addition, control of the molecular orientations in thin films is important for maximizing the light absorption and emission of films for OSCs and organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), respectively, to improve the device performance.17 The shape and conformation of polymers also strongly affect the molecular orientations in thin films. Thus, the relationship between the molecular shape and the optoelectronic properties of thin films is of fundamental importance in the field of polymer-based electronic devices.
We have developed a V-shaped electron-deficient unit, triphenyleno[1,2-c:7,8-c′]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole) (TPTz), with strong electron-withdrawing ability and an extended π-conjugation plane by fusing two benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) moieties to a triphenylene core, and we constructed a wide-bandgap copolymer (PTPTz-Th-IDT; Scheme 1).‡ The non-linear structure of PTPTz-Th-IDT leads to the frontier molecular orbital confined within a few repeating units and increases its amorphous nature, but it exhibited sufficient hole transport characteristics (a field-effect hole mobility of ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). Despite the low crystallinity, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs based on PTPTz-Th-IDT reached 10% with Y6 as the acceptor.18 Furthermore, the solubility of TPTz-based polymers could be tuned by side-chain engineering, which afforded a reliable molecular orientation by sequential deposition of the donor and acceptor materials, leading to a higher PCE compared with that of the mixed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) device.19 These results demonstrate that the TPTz unit is a promising electron-deficient building block with unique features that stem from its large π-conjugation plane and the sharp angle of the connection (60°); the polymers consisting of the TPTz unit may have zigzag conformations with the coplanarity of the π-conjugated units in the backbone. However, it is still unclear how important these factors are in OSCs. These findings motivated us to explore the relationship between the zigzag molecular structure of TPTz-based polymers and the resulting properties, such as molecular conformation, orientation, electronic structure, and photovoltaic performance.

In this study, we synthesized a series of π-conjugated copolymers by combining the V-shaped TPTz unit with indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene (IDT) as the co-monomer unit to investigate the effects of the ring fusion in the TPTz unit and the spacers connecting TPTz and IDT units. The optoelectronic properties in thin films and the photovoltaic performance of these polymers were compared to extract the important factors for designing planar-zigzag polymers with suitable optoelectronic properties for OSCs.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal properties
The synthetic route to the copolymers studied in this work is shown in Scheme 1. The synthesis of 4,7-dibromo-12,13-bis((2-octyldodecyl)oxy)triphenyleno[1,2-c:7,8-c′]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole); TPTz-Br), its unfused precursor (7,7′-(4,5-bis((2-octyldodecyl)oxy)-1,2-phenylene)bis(4-bromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole); oPhBT-Br), and the derivative with one thiophene spacer (4,7-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-12,13-bis((2-octyldodecyl)oxy)triphenyleno[1,2-c:7,8-c′]bis-([1,2,5]thia-diazole); TPTz-Th-Br) was reported previously.18 The building block with bithiophene spacers, TPTz-2Th-Br, was prepared from TPTz-Th-Br by Stille coupling with tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane (55% yield) and subsequent bromination using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) (96% yield). With all the acceptor units in hand, Stille coupling copolymerization of these units with (4,4,9,9-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(tri-methyl-stannane) (IDT-Sn) was conducted to afford three new copolymers (Scheme 1). All the polymers were purified by reprecipitation in MeOH, filtration and sequential extraction using a Soxhlet apparatus with MeOH, acetone, hexane, CH2Cl2, and CHCl3. However, owing to the difference in solubility, the fractions collected for these polymers were different. The hexane-soluble fraction of PoPhBT-IDT and PTPTz-IDT was collected, concentrated, and reprecipitated in MeOH to give the target polymers as red solids (PoPhBT-IDT: 328.0 mg and 89% yield; PTPTz-IDT: 280.0 mg and 76% yield). The CHCl3-soluble fraction of PTPTz-2Th-IDT was collected and a solid was obtained (234.0 mg, 54% yield). Owing to the long-branched alkyl chains, all the polymers showed good solubility in common solvents, such as CH2Cl2 and CHCl3, and PoPhBT-IDT and PTPTz-IDT could even be dissolved in hexane. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed in CHCl3 to measure the molecular weights of the polymers (Table 1). All the polymers besides PoPhBT-IDT had similar number-averaged molecular weights (Mn), ranging from 11 to 15 kDa, indicating comparable degrees of polymerization for the detailed analyses to elucidate the structure–property–performance relationship. PoPhBT-IDT showed a smaller Mn of 4.6 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.46, which could be attributed to the low reactivity for the coupling reaction resulting from the steric hindrance of the ortho-phenylene linkage. According to the thermal gravimetric analysis curves under an N2 atmosphere (Fig. S1, ESI†), the polymers all exhibited high thermal stability, and the 5% weight loss decomposition temperatures were around 400 °C (Table 1).

Molecular conformation calculations
The stable conformations of the polymers were investigated by theoretical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The model compounds consisting of three TPTz units and two IDT units were calculated, and the 2-octyldocecyl side chains in TPTz segments were replaced with methyl groups for simplicity, but the hexyl chains in the IDT segments were kept because these alkyl side chains would strongly affect the stable conformations of the polymers through steric hindrance. In PoPhBT-IDT with the non-fused precursor, there were large torsions between the ortho-phenylene ring and BT units, and between the BT and IDT units (Fig. 1a). These twists distorted the main chain conformation. Ring fusion in the TPTz unit increased the planarity of the acceptor unit and the coplanarity between the TPTz and IDT units, as shown in PTPTz-IDT (Fig. 1b). However, the large steric hinderance between the 4-hexylphenyl rings of the IDT units caused the two adjacent IDT units to deviate from coplanarity. In contrast, the introduction of thiophene spacers between the TPTz and IDT units diminished the steric hinderance of the side chains, as shown in PTPTz-Th-IDT (Fig. 1c) and PTPTz-2Th-IDT (Fig. 1d). The thiophene linkage allowed sufficient space to avoid the interference of the alkyl side chains, leading to the coplanarity of the two adjacent IDT units, and thus to the planar-zigzag conformations of the main chain in PTPTz-Th-IDT and PTPTz-2Th-IDT.

Electronic properties
The calculated difference in the molecular conformations among the polymers should also cause differences in the optical properties of the thin films. We measured the anisotropic optical constants of the polymer films by using variable-angle spectral ellipsometry (VASE). Based on the estimated extinction coefficients in the ordinary (ko) and extraordinary (ke) directions with a uniaxial anisotropic model, we calculated order parameter S of the transient dipole moment according to the following equation.20  Here, S = 0 and −0.5 indicate that the transition dipole moment alignment is completely random or horizontal (in-plane orientation), respectively. Under the reasonable assumption that the transition dipole moment of the polymers is along the polymer chain direction, S represents the average chain alignment in the films. Fig. 2a shows order parameter S for the polymers in the absorbing wavelength range. In the whole absorption region, the PoPhBT-IDT film had an S value close to 0, indicating almost random chain orientation in the thin film. This result is consistent with the DFT calculation that PoPhBT-IDT has a large chain torsion. In contrast, the PTPTz-IDT film had an average S value close to −0.2, indicating that the polymer chains preferentially adopted an in-plane orientation. This could be due to the higher planarity of the acceptor unit, as indicated by the calculation. The introduction of the thiophene spacers between the TPTz and IDT units (PTPTz-Th-IDT and PTPTz-2Th-IDT) lowered the S values further to close to −0.35 on average. These results imply that the extended π-conjugation and the planarity of the chain structure aligned the polymer chain parallel to the substrate. Considering the zigzag structures of these polymers, the π-planes of the polymer backbones could align parallel to the substrate (the face-on orientation). Note that VASE captures the optical transition in both crystalline and amorphous regions in a film; therefore, the chain orientation is the average of the whole film.
 Fig. 2  (a) Order parameter S of the polymers in the films measured by VASE. (b) Absorption coefficient in the in-plane direction of pristine polymer films. (c) Energy level diagrams of the polymers and Y6. 
The absorption coefficients in the in-plane direction obtained by VASE are shown in Fig. 2b. PoPhBT-IDT, with a large chain torsion and random conformation, had the smallest onset wavelength. Extending the π-conjugation and increasing the chain planarity shifted the onset wavelength to longer wavelengths. Because PTPTz-2Th-IDT had the longest π-conjugation and an in-plane molecular orientation, it exhibited the largest absorption coefficient in the in-plane direction. The extracted parameters for these optical measurements are summarized in Table 1.
The energy of the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO, EHOMO) was evaluated using photoemission yield spectroscopy (Fig. S2, ESI†),21 and a schematic of the energy levels of the polymers is shown in Fig. 2c. The polymer with the non-fused precursor (PoPhBT-IDT) showed the deepest HOMO level, probably because of the limited π-conjugation due to the twisting ortho-phenylene ring and the lower molecular weight. Increasing the π-conjugation by the ring fusion (PTPTz-IDT) and inserting a thiophene (PTPTz-Th-IDT) or bithiophene spacer (PTPTz-2Th-IDT) made EHOMO shallower, indicating the extended delocalization of the HOMOs.
Crystallinity
The one-dimensional (1D) X-ray diffraction and two-dimensional (2D) grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) results of the polymer films are shown in Fig. S3 and S4, (ESI†) respectively. No peak appeared in the 1D-XRD out-of-plane direction for all the polymers, and only PTPTz-2Th-IDT showed small peaks in the in-plane direction with a d-spacing of 2.89 nm, which may be attributed to the interchain distance. Except for PTPTz-2Th-IDT, all the polymer films showed only weak ring-shaped scattering in 2D-GIWAXS corresponding to the interchain distance for the polymers. For the PTPTz-2Th-IDT film, weak scattering from π–π stacking appeared in the out-of-plane direction, indicating the face-on orientation of the main chain. These results suggest that the ring fusion of the TPTz unit and the introduction of the thiophene spacers caused the in-plane alignment of the polymer chains, increasing the chain planarity and local chain order; however, the degree of the crystallinity was generally low, and most of the polymers remained amorphous.
Charge transport properties
The field-effect hole transport mobility of the polymers was investigated using a bottom-gate top-contact field-effect transistor (FET) device. The device structure was Si/SiO2 (300 nm)/octadecyltrimethoxysilane//polymer/Au/Ag, and the polymer layer was fabricated by a contact film transfer method (see the ESI†). Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the FET characteristics of these devices, and the charge transport properties are summarized in Table 2. PoPhBT-IDT showed a low hole mobility of 1.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was attributed to the limited π-conjugation and the random polymer-chain orientation in the films, as suggested by the VASE results. With the fused TPTz unit, the mobility of PTPTz-IDT increased by an order of magnitude (6.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), which agreed with the larger anisotropy in the in-plane direction observed by VASE. By introducing the thiophene and bithiophene spacer, the planarity of the polymer chains increased (Fig. 1c and d) and the chains aligned in a more in-plane direction. However, the thiophene and bithiophene spacer led to slightly reduced mobilities of 2.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PTPTz-Th-IDT and 5.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PTPTz-2Th-IDT. We also evaluated the hole mobility of the polymers in the out-of-plane direction under the space charge limited conditions employing a hole-only device structure (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/MoO3/Ag). The results are shown in Fig. S6, (ESI†) and the mobility values are summarized in Table 2. PoPhBT-IDT having randomly orientated polymer chains showed lower SCLC mobility by two orders of magnitude than other polymers. The difference in the SCLC mobility can also be attributed to the chain orientations; the face-on orientation benefits the charge carrier transport to the out-of-plane direction. These results indicate that the chain orientation impacts the charge carrier transport properties of the amorphous polymers.

Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of these polymers as electron donors were investigated by using the device structure ITO/ZnO/polymer:Y6/MoO3/Ag, where Y6 was used as the electron acceptor. The optimized D:A weight ratio of 1:1.3 was used for all the polymers. The optimized concentration of the 1,8-diiodooctane solvent additive and thermal annealing conditions are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The current density–voltage characteristics under simulated sunlight are presented in Fig. 3a, and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The PoPhBT-IDT:Y6 device exhibited a low PCE of 2.4% with a low Jsc of 7.7 mA cm−2. This may be due to the slightly deeper EHOMO of PoPhBT-IDT than that of Y6, leading to the insufficient energy offset for the charge separation (Fig. 2c), although the lower molecular weight of PoPhBT-IDT could be another factor. The PTPTz-IDT:Y6 device showed a higher PCE (8.2%), suggesting that the ring fusion in the acceptor unit increased the efficiency, possibly by tuning EHOMO and ΔEoptg. The PTPTz-Th-IDT:Y6 device showed the highest PCE of 10.5%, as previously reported.18 Introducing a thiophene spacer between TPTz and IDT made EHOMO of PTPTz-Th-IDT shallower, which decreased VOC slightly, but the increased planarity and higher degree of face-on orientation increased the absorption and the charge separation efficiency, resulting in higher Jsc. The PTPTz-2Th-IDT:Y6 device had a slightly smaller Jsc, Voc, and fill factor (FF) than the PTPTz-Th-IDT:Y6 device, leading to a decreased PCE of 9.0%. X-ray diffraction results indicated that the introduction of the bithiophene spacer improved the crystallinity of PTPTz-2Th-IDT, but it did not improve the OSC performance, suggesting that the crystallinity is not the PCE limiting factor in these polymers.

(c) Irradiated light intensity dependence of JSC. (d) Normalized collected charge density during the transient photocurrent measurement. 
The external and internal quantum efficiency (EQE and IQE) spectra of these OSCs are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†) and Fig. 3b, respectively. PTPTz-Th-IDT:Y6 and PTPTz-2Th-IDT:Y6 showed higher EQE and IQE values than the other polymers. These results imply that the higher Jsc for the polymers was not only due to the increase in light absorption, but was also due to the increase in the charge carrier generation and collection efficiency.
The light intensity dependence of Jsc and transient photocurrent measurements revealed the effect of non-geminate recombination in OSCs.22 High non-geminate recombination under short-circuit conditions results in a slope below unity for the plot of Jscversus the irradiated light intensity. Fig. 3c shows the light intensity dependence of Jsc. The efficient OSCs, such as PTPTz-Th-IDT:Y6 and PTPTz-2Th-IDT:Y6, had a linear slope close to unity, whereas PoPhBT-IDT:Y6 exhibited a slightly smaller slope (0.91), indicating Jsc of this OSC suffered from non-geminate recombination.
We quantitatively evaluated the effect of non-geminate recombination on Jsc using a transient photocurrent technique,23,24 and the results are shown in Fig. 3d. In this measurement, the transient photocurrent generated by a pulse laser was collected under short-circuit conditions with different steady-state background light intensities. If the non-geminate recombination is negligible, the collected charge density is independent of the background light intensity, whereas if it is not negligible, the charge density increases as the light intensity decreases. We used an LED light as the background white light and set the 100% intensity to give the same Jsc as under AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2 irradiation. The collected charge density in the efficient OSCs (red and purple) was almost independent of the light intensity, whereas PoPhBT-IDT:Y6 showed decreased collected charge density at 100% irradiation (25% loss). These quantitative results were consistent with the light intensity dependence of Jsc (Fig. 3c).
Combining these results with the film morphology data obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM), we discuss the reason for the differences in the photovoltaic performance in this series of donor polymers. In Fig. 4, the top panels show the morphology of the pure polymer films, and the bottom panels show those of the BHJ films with Y6. The pure polymer films were uniform and smooth, with root mean square (RMS) roughness of <1.0 nm. This result was reasonable because these polymers were amorphous or weakly crystalline. However, in the BHJ films with Y6, the PoPhBT-IDT and PTPTz-IDT films had large RMS roughness values of 17.7 and 13.3 nm, respectively, owing to the large grains. These grains arose from the aggregation of Y6 because the polymer does not tend to aggregate. These large domains prevented the exciton collection to the donor/acceptor interface, which could lead to the small Jsc of PoPhBT-IDT and PTPTz-IDT BHJ OSCs. For PoPhBT-IDT, 25% non-geminate recombination loss and insufficient HOMO offset also decreased Jsc. In contrast, PTPTz-Th-IDT and PTPTz-2Th-IDT showed smooth morphology in the BHJ films (Fig. 4c and d), indicating that the formation of large grains of Y6 was suppressed. Owing to the small domains of the donor polymer and acceptor, PTPTz-Th-IDT and PTPTz-2Th-IDT exhibited higher Jsc, reflecting the more efficient exciton collection in the domains.

Conclusions
A series of copolymers with TPTz-related electron-deficient building blocks were synthesized to elucidate the effects of the ring fusion and spacers. The ring fusion in the TPTz unit resulted in extended π-conjugation through planarization and a more favorable face-on alignment of the pristine polymer films. The thiophene spacers were important in relieving the steric hindrance of the alkyl side chains to achieve the planar-zigzag conformation, which promoted the face-on alignment of the polymer chains in thin films. The chemical structure variations also affected the film morphologies, especially in the BHJ films. The superior properties of PTPTz-Th-IDT with the fused ring and one thiophene spacer led to its optimum performance in OSCs. This work gives detailed insights into the molecular design of planar-zigzag copolymers for organic electronics.

(China). oPhBT-Br, TPTz-Br, and TPTz-Th-Br were prepared following a previously reported procedure.18 Commercially available solvents and reagents were used without further purification unless otherwise noted.
Synthesis of TPTz-2Th-Br
A Schlenk tube was charged with TPTz-Th-Br (0.504 g, 0.40 mmol), 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene (0.47 g, 1.2 mmol), and Pd(PPh3)4 (46.2 mg, 0.04 mmol) in dry toluene (25 mL) under an N2 atmosphere.

General procedure for Stille copolymerization
A vial was charged with the bromide monomer (1.0 equiv.), the stannane comonomer (1.0 equiv.), Pd2(dba)3·CHCl3 (0.02 equiv.), P(o-Tol)3 (0.2 equiv.), and chlorobenzene (0.05 mM). The vial was purged with argon for 30 min and sealed. Then, the reaction mixture was heated in a microwave reactor at 180 °C for 1 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into methanol (80 mL). The precipitate was filtered and placed in a Soxhlet apparatus with methanol, acetone, hexane, dichloromethane, and chloroform. The hexane (PoPhBT-IDT and PTPTz-IDT) and chloroform (PTPTz-2Th-IDT) fractions were collected, concentrated, and reprecipitated in methanol. The polymers were isolated by filtration and dried in vacuo as red or dark-red solids.
