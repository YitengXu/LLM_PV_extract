    , Accepted 13th April 2016First published on 13th April 2016AbstractTo make quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) competitive, we investigated the effect of Ni2+ ion incorporation into a CdS layer to create long-lived charge carriers and reduce the electron–hole recombination. The Ni2+-doped CdS (simplified as CdNiS) QD layer was introduced to a TiO2 surface via the simple successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method in order to introduce intermediate-energy levels in the QDs. The effects of different Ni2+ concentrations (5, 10, 15, and 20 mM) on the physical, chemical, and photovoltaic properties of the QDSSCs were investigated. The Ni2+ dopant improves the light absorption of the device, accelerates the electron injection kinetics, and reduces the charge recombination, which results in improved charge transfer and collection. The 15% CdNiS cell exhibits the best photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency (η) of 3.11% (JSC = 8.91 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.643 V, FF = 0.543) under one full sun illumination (AM 1.5 G). These results are among the best achieved for CdS-based QDSSCs. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and open circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements confirm that the Ni2+ dopant can suppress charge recombination, prolong the electron lifetime, and improve the power conversion efficiency of the cells.
1. Introduction
Solar cells can convert electricity directly from solar energy by the photovoltaic (PV) effect and help reduce carbon emissions.1,2 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received greater recognition as a feasible, low-cost alternative to high-priced conventional solar cells.3,4 Semiconductor quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) were later introduced.5 Compound semiconductor QDSSCs are liquid-junction photovoltaic devices with different quantum dot (QD) sensitizers. The principle of QDSSCs is similar to that of DSSCs, with inorganic QDs replacing the dye molecules as incident light absorbers.6,7 QDSSCs are receiving much attention for the development of third-generation solar cells with acceptable power conversion efficiency.
In comparison with molecular dyes, QDs offer the following versatile characteristics: a band gap that can be adjusted by controlling the size, shape, and composition of the QDs over a wide wavelength range;8 low- to medium-purity component materials that are produced by cost-effective processes;9 direct hot carrier transfer mobility;10 high molar extinction coefficients;11 large intrinsic dipole moments as alternate light harvesters;12 and distinct energy levels for generating multiple electron–hole pairs based on the impact ionization effect.13,14 These properties make QDs desirable for the design of next-generation solar energy cells. However, the most recently reported power conversion efficiency of QDSSCs is more than 8%,15 which is still far inferior to their photovoltaic theoretical value (44%) and much lower than that of conventional DSSCs (13%).16 Important reasons for this efficiency are: (a) the difficulty of assembling a sufficiently large number of QDs on a mesoporous TiO2 matrix to obtain a well-covered monolayer without cluster formation,17 (b) the narrow adsorption range of QDs,18 (c) recombination at the interface between the counter electrode (CE) and the electrolyte,19 and (d) charge recombination at the QD–electrolyte interface.20
As sensitizers for sensitized solar cells, inorganic semiconductor QDs, such as CdS,21 CdSe,22 CdTe,23 PbS,24 PbSe,25 CuInS2,26 CuInSe2,27 InP,28 and InAs,29 have been extensively studied as light harvesters due to their unique advantages. Among these QD sensitizers, cadmium chalcogenide CdX quantum dots (X = S, Se, Te) are promising materials for liquid junction solar cells, which have been rejuvenated because of the emergence of QDs.30 CdS being a direct wide-band gap material (e.g. ∼2.42 eV) is a remarkable semiconductor material extensively used in solar cells, LEDs, flat panel displays, thin film transistors, optical waveguides, and electrically driven laser systems.31–34 CdS is the most important II–VI semiconductor compound with good optical characteristics and a higher energy level of the conduction band (CB) than that of titanium dioxide (TiO2).35,36 The higher conduction band allows for very effective injection of excited electrons from CdS to the TiO2 layer.
Different sizes of CdS QDs can be fabricated by absorption on semiconductors with a wide band gap using wet processes. Such processes include successive ionic layer adsorption, and reaction (SILAR)37 and chemical bath deposition (CBD),38 which can be used to attain a broader spectral adsorption region. However, the low separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and easy corrosion are not favorable for the wide applications of CdS in semiconductor solar cells. Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a highly efficient and corrosion-resistant sensitizer based on conventional semiconductor materials to improve the power conversion efficiency of QDSSCs.
Many techniques have been investigated for improving QDSSCs, such as optimizing the QD-sensitized electrode,39 controlling the crystal size and size distribution of QDs,40 and modifying the intrinsic properties of semiconductors by introducing dopants.41 Doping with active transition metal ions modifies the electronic and photo-physical properties of QDs.41,42 It is also possible to adjust the electrical and optical properties of semiconducting nanocrystals by controlling the type and concentration of the dopants. Doping also creates electronic states in the mid-gap region of the QDs, which alters the charge separation and recombination mechanism.37,41,42 CdS QDs have been doped with transition metallic ions like Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, and Cu2+, which enhanced the photoelectrical performance of the QDSSCs. Kamat et al. reported photoanodes using CdS QDs doped with Mn ions and explored new materials that resulted in high photovoltaic efficiency in QDSSCs.41 Recently, Yu et al. synthesized Mn-doped CdS QDs and produced a power conversion efficiency of 1.19%.43 Huang et al. achieved an efficiency of 2.02% with a Cu-doped-PbS/CdS QDSSC.44 With Ni2+ doping, it is possible to alter the electronic and optical properties of QDs.45,46 Ni2+ has eight d electrons, and Ni2+-doped CdS QDs show near-infrared emission due to the strong p–d hybridization of Ni2+ in the doped semiconductor. Kamran et al. reported that this near-IR emission shift with varied dopant concentrations in Ni-doped CdS was due to the quantum confinement effect of the NiS cluster in CdS; this material may be used as a nanoscale light source tuned by the dopant, possibly for solar cells if highly doped.47 Moreover, this hybridization can result in a very long lifetime.47 This would be beneficial since the long-lived charge carriers can improve the efficiency of solar cells. Recently, Chen et al. applied Ni-doped CdS and PbS cosensitized QD on TiO2 as a photoanode for a QDSSC by the SILAR method.48 The Ni-doped CdS device exhibited an efficiency of 2.43%, which was increased to 3.60% by the Ni-doped CdS and PbS QD co-sensitized TiO2 nanorod array photoelectrode. This prompted us to explore the optimization of Ni-doped CdS QDs to boost the photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs and other effects of introducing Ni.
To our knowledge, this is the first report on the optimization of Ni-doping in a photoanode for designing a high-efficiency QDSSC with improved electrochemical properties. We used various deposition amounts of Ni (5, 10, 15, and 20 mM) mixed with cationic and anionic precursor solutions of CdS and then deposited Ni-doped CdS QDs on a TiO2 mesoporous film in situ by the SILAR method. We examined the morphological, optical, and structural properties of Ni-doped and undoped CdS QDs. Under standard simulated AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination, the QDSSC based on the Ni-doped CdS photoelectrode can present a power conversion efficiency of 3.11%, which is higher than that of a CdS-based QDSSC (2.00%). Most importantly, by exchanging CdS with the Ni-doped CdS, the photostability of the cell improved significantly.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Cadmium acetate dehydrate [Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O], nickel sulfate hexahydrate (NiSO4·6H2O), sodium sulfide (Na2S), sulfur (S), potassium chloride (KCl), copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate [CuSO4·5H2O], sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3), urea (CH4N2O), and TiO2 paste (Ti-nanoxide HT/SP) were supplied by Solaronix. All other chemicals were commercially available and analytical grade.
2.2 Fabrication of TiO2 electrodes
A fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, 13 Ω sq−2, Hartford Glass Co. Inc.) substrate was used to prepare the photoanodes and CEs. TiO2 films were prepared on an ultrasonically well-cleaned FTO substrate by the doctor blade method using 20 nm anatase TiO2 particles (Ti-nanoxide HT/SP, Solaronix), which were first deposited on the FTO substrates with an active area of 0.27 cm2. The TiO2 films were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min to remove the impurities, and a 7.5 μm-thick layer was obtained after solvent evaporation.49
2.3 Preparation of CdS and Ni-doped CdS photoanodes
The SILAR method was used for the deposition of bare CdS and Ni-doped CdS QDs on the mesoporous TiO2 surface. The TiO2 electrodes were first immersed into a 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O aqueous solution for 5 min to allow Cd2+ to adsorb onto the TiO2. The electrodes were then rinsed with ethanol and deionized water and immersed in a 0.1 M Na2S aqueous solution for 5 min, where the pre-adsorbed Cd2+ reacts with S2− to form CdS. Finally, the films were rinsed again with ethanol and deionized water and dried with a drier. The two-step immersion procedure is one SILAR cycle and was repeated eight times. The as-synthesized electrode is referred to as CdS.
For doping with Ni2+, different nickel sulfate hexahydrate (NiSO4·6H2O) concentrations of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mM (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) were mixed with a 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O aqueous solution. This enabled the co-adsorption of Ni2+ and Cd2+ ions, which promoted the incorporation of Ni2+ into the CdS film. The undoped and Ni-doped films were labeled according to the Ni dopant concentration as CdS, 5% CdNiS, 10% CdNiS, 15% CdNiS, and 20% CdNiS. CuS CEs were prepared using a literature method.50
2.4 Device fabrication
The photoanodes and the CuS CEs were assembled and sealed at 100 °C using a transparent sealant (SX 1170-60, Solaronix). The space between the electrodes was filled with a polysulfide electrolyte, which consisted of sodium sulfide (1 M), sulfur (2 M), and potassium chloride (0.1 M) in a solution with a methanol-to-water ratio of 7:3. The devices were left for a few hours for the electrolyte to diffuse, and the samples were tested under one sun illumination.
2.5 Characterization
The crystalline nature of the electrodes was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/Max-2400, Rigaku) using a Cu Kα source operated at 40 kV and 30 mA in the 2θ range of 20–80°. The surface morphology of the electrodes was investigated using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, S-2400, Hitachi) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer operated at 15 kV. X-ray photon spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 with monochromatic Al-Kα radiation at 1486.6 eV and an electron take-off angle of 90°. The surface roughness of the substrates was characterized by using an atomic force microscope (JPK NanoWizard II AFM, JPK instruments, Berlin, Germany) with a scan rate of 0.8 Hz in contact mode.
The UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded using an OPTIZEN 3220UV spectrophotometer. The current–voltage characteristics of the QDSSCs were examined under one sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) using an ABET Technologies (USA) solar simulator with an irradiance uniformity of ±3%. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted on the QDSSCs using a BioLogic potentiostat/galvanostat/EIS analyzer (SP-150, France) under one sun illumination. The frequency ranged from 100 mHz to 500 kHz at room temperature. The applied bias voltage and AC amplitude were set to VOC of the QDSSCs and 10 mV, respectively. The electrical impedance was characterized using Nyquist and Bode plots.
3. Results and discussion
TiO2 films were prepared by coating commercial TiO2 paste (Ti-Nanoxide HT/TP, Solaronix) onto the FTO substrate through the doctor blade method, and the SILAR method was used to deposit Ni-doped and undoped CdS QDs on the TiO2 films. The XRD pattern of the TiO2 substrate is shown in Fig. S1.†Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the CdS-sensitized TiO2 films with various Ni doping concentrations. The XRD patterns of pure TiO2 show the peaks at 2θ values of 25.2°, 37.7°, 47.9°, 53.8°, and 62.5°, which correspond to the anatase TiO2 tetragonal anatase structure (JCPDS:21-1272). The formation of CdS was confirmed by the appearance of peaks at 26.4° and 54.7°, which can be fitted to the (111) and (222) faces of cubic CdS (JCPDS:80-0019). The asterisks in the figure indicate the peaks from the FTO glass substrate. There are no signals for NiS, but a slight shift toward higher 2θ values for CdNiS indicates that Ni2+ (effective ionic radius: 0.69 Å) substitutionally occupied the Cd2+ sites (effective ionic radius: 0.95 Å).
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of the undoped and Ni-doped CdS QD-sensitized TiO2 films. 
The surface morphologies of the sample films were examined by FE-SEM, as shown in Fig. 2. From Fig. 2(a) we can find the morphology of TiO2 particles in ∼20 nm sizes. The bare CdS film in Fig. 2(b) shows uniformly distributed nanoparticles on the TiO2 surface. It is easy to find that after depositing CdS QDs, the surface of the mesoscopic TiO2 film becomes much rougher. And due to the adsorption of quantum dots on the surface, the size of the TiO2 particle becomes bigger, too. With 5% Ni doping, the surface structures become closer than on the bare CdS QDs. The gaps between the nanoparticles were reduced by the Ni, as shown in Fig. 2(c)–(f). The Ni-doping exhibits a rougher surface than the bare CdS nanoparticles, which have a smooth surface. The pore sizes in the films decreased with increased Ni doping, and the pores were severely blocked with 20% CdNiS. This was caused by excess Ni doping, which likely restricts the movement of the redox couple ions through the pores and hinders ion transport. The elements in the bare CdS and Ni-doped CdS photoanodes were confirmed by EDS analysis, and their resultant atomic percentages are shown in Table S1 of the ESI.† Initially, the atomic percentages of Cd and S were found to be approximately 8.88% and 11.46%, respectively, which indicates the successful deposition of CdS onto the TiO2. As the percentage of the Ni dopant increased, the atomic composition of Cd decreased, as shown in Table S1.† The EDX results confirmed the formation of CdNiS QDs on the TiO2.

The composition of the bare CdS and 15% CdNiS films was examined by XPS, as shown in Fig. 3. The survey XPS spectra in Fig. 3a show peaks for S2p, Cd3d, Ti2p, and O1s, along with an additional Ni2p peak for the CdNiS sample. The binding energy peaks of Cd 3d5/2 are observed at 405.2 and 405.0 eV for the CdS and CdNiS films, respectively. The peak shift clearly shows that Ni2+ cations substitute for the Cd2+ in CdS when forming CdNiS. The binding energies of the Cd 3d3/2 peak for the CdS and CdNiS films were 412 and 411.7 eV, respectively. Importantly, the Ni 2p peak can be observed at 875.1 eV for the CdNiS sample (Fig. 3c). The spectrum for S 2p was fitted and yielded peaks of S 2p1/2 and S 2p3/2 at binding energies of 162.4 eV and 161.2 eV for the bare CdS film, while the peaks occurred at 162.1 eV and 161.0 eV for the CdNiS film, respectively. The shift of the corresponding Cd 3d and S 2p peaks toward lower binding energies confirms the doping of CdS. These results confirm that Ni was successfully doped into the CdS QDs.

The surface topography of the electrodes was observed by scanning probe atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 4. The bare CdS QDs on the TiO2 film in Fig. 4(a) show a root-mean square roughness (Rms) of 17.4 nm. In Fig. 4(b–e), the CdS QD film with Ni doping reveals a relatively smooth surface for the thin films. Rms decreased to 9.3, 7.1, 5.4, and 6.3 nm for the 5% CdNiS, 10% CdNiS, 15% CdNiS, and 20% CdNiS electrodes, respectively. Clearly, the surface quality of the CdS QD thin films can be greatly improved by Ni doping. The decrease in the surface roughness results from filling of the pores in the TiO2. The energy conversion efficiency of the CdS QDSSC mainly depends on the low roughness of the CdS surface. The reduction of the surface roughness in Ni-doped CdS tends to boost the power conversion efficiency of the QDSSCs,51 which affects the optical properties.

The optical properties of the Ni-doped and undoped CdS QD-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes were measured by UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 5). The absorption edge of the TiO2 electrode appears at about 375 nm. The absorption onsets occur in these spectra at around ∼516, 521, 527, 532, and 536 nm for the CdS, 5% CdNiS, 10% CdNiS, 15% CdNiS, and 20% CdNiS, respectively. The absorbance intensity increases with the amount of Ni doping along with noticeable shifts of the absorbance edge towards higher wavelengths. The band gap of CdS (2.40 eV) is higher than that of all the Ni-doped CdS nanoparticles (5% CdNiS: 2.38; 10% CdNiS: 2.35; 15% CdNiS: 2.33; 20% CdNiS: 2.31 eV). This indicates that the introduction of Ni2+ has a significant effect on the light absorption properties. The improved absorbance range of the Ni-doped CdS films is due to the improved surface morphology and the introduction of intermediate-energy levels into the CdS QDs by the Ni dopant. The visible light absorption indicated that Ni was successfully doped into the CdS QDs, which may improve the QDSSC performance.

Fig. 6 shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the QDSSCs with different concentrations of Ni2+ ions measured under one sun illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2). The performance parameters of the solar cells are listed in Table 1. QDSSCs were fabricated with the cells and measured to ensure the reproducibility of our results (see Table S2 in the ESI†). For the QDSSCs with the un-doped CdS sample, the values for JSC, open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and η were 7.39 mA cm−2, 0.601 V, 0.451 and 2.00%, respectively. All Ni2+-doped CdS layers showed increases in all photovoltaic parameters (JSC, VOC, FF, and η) compared to the undoped cell. The 5% CdNiS QDs increased both JSC and VOC. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) was improved to 2.36% with JSC of 7.54 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.619 V, and FF of 0.504. On increasing the Ni concentration to 10%, η slightly improved to 2.45% with the VOC, JSC, and FF values of 0.619 V, 8.01 mA cm−2, and 0.493, respectively.

Ni-doped and undoped CdS photoanodes with CuS CE were filled with a polysulfide electrolyte solution (1 M Na2S, 2 M S, and 0.1 M KCl).

The best performance was achieved with the 15% CdNiS cell, which had a PCE of 3.11% (with VOC = 0.643 V, JSC = 8.91 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.543). This is one of the highest efficiencies reported to date for CdS-based QDSSCs. However, further increasing the doping concentration to 20% reduced the cell performance because JSC and VOC values decreased. However, the overall η (2.96%) is still much higher than that of the bare CdS, 5% CdNiS, and 10% CdNiS electrodes. The change in photovoltaic performance is due to the Ni2+ ions replacing the Cd2+ ions, which greatly influences the optical properties of CdS and enhances the visible light absorption.52 The midgap states were created by doping facilitate electron injection from the QDs to the CB of TiO2, which is responsible for the improvement of JSC in the doped QDSSCs.41 Similarly, the 15% CdNiS cells exhibit the highest VOC value (0.643 V) among all the cells (the values were 0.601–0.623 V for other cells). Furthermore, the coverage of CdNiS QDs on the TiO2 surface can also effectively prevent direct contact between the TiO2 and electrolyte and restrain the recombination of photogenerated electrons with the Sn2− species in the polysulfide electrolyte. The enhanced JSC and VOC improve the PCEs of the solar cells with the Ni2+ dopant in either the QD sensitizer or the passivation layer.
EIS was employed to further investigate the interfacial electron transfer process in the QDSSCs and to explain the dramatic increase of the photocurrent and efficiency after doping. Fig. 7 shows the resulting Nyquist and Bode plots. Fig. 7(a) displays the impedance spectra of the QDSSCs measured under illumination (100 mW cm−2) while applying a 10 mV AC signal over the frequency range of 100 mHz to 500 kHz at a bias of VOC. The corresponding equivalent circuit is illustrated in the inset of Fig. 7(b) based on the diffusion–recombination model proposed by Wang et al.53

In the transmission line model of the QDSSC, RS is the series resistance, which includes the sheet resistance of the FTO glass and the contact resistance of the cell, while RFTO and CFTO are the charge-transfer resistance and the corresponding double-layer capacitance at the exposed FTO–electrolyte interface, respectively. Rw (Rw = rwL) is the transport resistance of the electrons in the TiO2 film, Rk (Rk = rk/L) is the charge-transfer resistance of the charge recombination process between electrons in the mesoscopic TiO2 film and Sn2− in the electrolyte, and Cμ (Cμ = CμL) is the chemical capacitance of the TiO2 film. ZN is the Warburg element showing the Nernst diffusion of Sn2− in the electrolyte, RCE and CCE are the charge-transfer resistance and double-layer capacitance at the CE, respectively, and L is the thickness of the mesoscopic TiO2 film.45 Other important parameters for the devices are listed in Table 1.

The fitting results reveal that the electron transport resistance Rw of the 15% CdNiS cell is 0.33 Ω, which is lower than those of the bare CdS (1.11 Ω), 5% CdNiS (0.82 Ω), 10% CdNiS (0.52 Ω), and 20% CdNiS (0.46 Ω) cells. The lower Rw value is favorable for fast charge transport and results from the effective connection of the anatase TiO2 particles to form a continuous electron pathway in the Ni-doped CdS films. According to the Nyquist plots, the values of interfacial charge recombination resistance Rk are 4.08, 3.87, 2.47, 1.82, and 2.41 Ω for the CdS, 5% CdNiS, 10% CdNiS, 15% CdNiS, and 20% CdNiS devices, respectively.55 Based on the relationship Rdc = 1/3Rw + Rk, the reduced Rk will lower the DC resistance of the cell and improve the device performance, especially the fill factor (FF).53,54Rk is much higher than Rw, meaning that the device has a carrier collection efficiency near unity.53 Moreover, Rk/Rw is 5.51 for the 15% CdNiS cell, which is much higher than that of the bare CdS (3.67), 5% CdNiS (4.71), 10% CdNiS (4.75) and 20% CdNiS (5.23) cells, respectively. A higher Rk/Rw suggests that more electrons are injected in the 15% CdNiS electrode to keep the charge recombination low and increase the PCE for the solar cell.

L
n increased after doping, which indicates a better collection yield from the injected electrons and leads to increased efficiency. The midgap states may serve as recombination centers for charges in the Ni-doped films. As a result, Ln increases and electron recombination becomes dominant in the charge collection. This increases the efficiency compared to the un-doped system. The electron lifetimes (τn) are 3.08, 3.64, 3.66, 4.10, and 4.00 ms, and the recombination rates (keff) are 324.67, 274.72, 273.22, 243.90, and 250.00 s−1 for the CdS, 5% CdNiS, 10% CdNiS, 15% CdNiS, and 20% CdNiS cells, respectively. The increase of τn explains the higher VOC observed in the Ni-doped CdS devices, since this parameter is strongly affected by the balance between the electron injection in TiO2 and the recombination with Sn2− in the electrolyte.
One reason for the low keff is the small resistance, which induced fast charge transport and transfer. Dn for the Ni-doped CdS cells was much larger than that of the bare CdS cell. The higher Dn for the 15% CdNiS QDSSCs could be explained by the higher number of injected electrons and the faster transport of electrons. The EIS parameters explain the higher JSC and power conversion efficiency observed for the Ni-doped CdS cells compared to the bare CdS cells. It is well known that the frequency is related to the electron lifetime (τe), which can be estimated using the following relationship: (5)where fmax is the value at which the low frequency peak occurs in the Bode plot. As can be seen in Fig. 7(c), the τe values of the bare CdS, 5% CdNiS, 10% CdNiS, 15% CdNiS, and 20% CdNiS are 1.24, 1.65, 2.37, 4.15, and 3.42 ms, respectively. The larger electron lifetime in QDSSCs based on the 15% CdNiS means that less electron recombination occurs at the perfect interface between the TiO2 and collector electrode. The calculated electron lifetime indicates that the perfect interface benefits the electronic transport in Ni-doped cells compared to the undoped cells.
OCVD analysis was conducted on the Ni-doped and undoped QDSSCs to obtain information about the recombination processes of photogenerated electrons with oxidized species in the redox couple in the electrolyte. At the beginning of the measurement, the cells were illuminated with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 to a steady voltage, after which the light was switched off and the open circuit voltage decay information was recorded. Fig. 8 shows that the transient VOC values of cells start stabilizing at their open circuit voltages upon illumination and continue to decay to nearly 0 V in darkness. The Ni-doped CdS cells exhibit higher VOC and slower decay kinetics compared to the undoped CdS based cells. This shows that the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons with the oxidized species in the electrolyte was significantly reduced by doping.
 Fig. 8  Open circuit decay curves of CdS and Ni-doped CdS QD-sensitized solar cells. 
The VOC decay rate directly reflects the electron lifetime (τe) because the excess electrons undergo recombination with the trap states and oxidative species in the electrolyte when the illumination is interrupted. The electron lifetime (τe) can be estimated by eqn (6): (6)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and e is the electronic charge. The voltage decay rate for the 15% CdNiS cell was much higher than for the other cells due to the suppressed recombination of photogenerated electrons. These results are in good agreement with the EIS studies that point to a reduction of recombination by the Ni-doped CdS.
EIS measurements were performed to obtain the chemical capacitance (Cμ) and recombination resistance (Rrec), as shown in Fig. 9. The measurements were performed under dark conditions at forward bias ranging from 0 V to higher than VOC in the frequency range of 500 kHz to 100 mHz. Rrec is related to the recombination between the electrons in the photoanode and holes in the electrolyte,56 whereas Cμ is related to the modified electron density of the semiconductor metal oxide as a function of the Fermi level.57Fig. 9a shows that the Rrec values of Ni-doped CdS cells are higher than those of the undoped CdS cells. Interestingly, the 15% CdNiS cell shows a higher recombination resistance than the other cells. This indicates suppressed electron recombination, which is mainly due to the Ni2+ ions blocking the electron recombination at the interface of the QDs and electrolyte. The larger Cμ values of the doped cells indicate the upward shift of the Fermi level, resulting in large VOC.57 These EIS results support a lower recombination rate for the Ni-doped CdS cells, which helps enhance the JSC and VOC values observed in the J–V measurements.

The CdS and 15% CdNiS QDSSCs were illuminated continuously in a solar simulator with a light intensity of 1.5 G at 100 mW cm−2 for 20 h. The PCE of the CdS and 15% CdNiS QDSSC was measured every 2 h for 10 h, as shown in Fig. 10. Compared with the initial performance, the CdS device showed a ∼2.5% decrease in the PCE, while the 15% CdNiS showed a ∼2.0% increase in the PCE in the course of 20 h. The increased PCE can be partially attributed to the capillary effect resulting in slow permeation of the electrolyte solution into the TiO2 pores, which enhanced the ionic transport due to heating of the polysulfide electrolyte.58 Therefore, the doped QDSSCs were much more stable than the undoped QDSSCs.

Fig. 11a and b compare the possible improvement mechanisms of the bare CdS and Ni-doped CdS QDs. The Ni dopant can accelerate the CdS deposition, improve the light absorption, and create electronic midgap states in the QD. This alters the charge separation and recombination dynamics. Also, the Ni2+ ions can significantly prevent direct contact between the TiO2 and electrolyte and reduce the recombination of photogenerated electrons with Sn2− species in the electrolyte. This leads to higher JSC in QDSSCs.

4. Conclusions
A new route for Ni-doped CdS QDSSCs has been developed using the facile SILAR method. The midgap states created by Ni2+ accelerate the exciton injection kinetics, which suppresses the interface recombination and improves the performance of the QDSSCs. The long-lived photogenerated charge carriers and reduced electron–hole recombination in the 15% CdNiS sensitized solar cells resulted in higher η of 3.11%, which is 35% greater than that of the bare CdS sensitized solar cells (2.00%). Furthermore, the doped QDSSCs show superior stability in the sulfide/polysulfide electrolyte, resulting in highly reproducible performance. The suppressed charge recombination rates in the internal QDs and at the QD/TiO2/electrolyte interface were confirmed by EIS and OVCD measurements. All these features reveal that the Ni-doped QD sensitizer is a promising candidate for the construction of high-efficiency QDSSCs. Further control of the recombination and optimization of the electrolyte and CE will contribute to greater improvement of the efficiencies for QDSSCs.
