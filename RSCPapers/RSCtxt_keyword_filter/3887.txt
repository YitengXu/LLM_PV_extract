    , Accepted 14th April 2015First published on 16th April 2015AbstractWe synthesized a uniquely shaped one-dimensional (1-D) TiO2 nanostructure having the morphology of yellow bristle grass with high surface area by the titanate route under mild reaction conditions. The electrospun TiO2–SiO2 composite nanofibers upon treatment with concentrated NaOH at 80 °C under ambient pressure for 24 h resulted in sodium titanate (Na2Ti3O7) nanostructures. The Na2Ti3O7 nanostructures have an overall 1-D fibrous morphology but the highly porous fiber surfaces were decorated with layered thorn-like features (a morphology resembling that of yellow bristle grass) resulting in high surface area (113 m2 g−1) and porosity. The Na2Ti3O7 nanostructures were converted into TiO2 nanostructures of the same morphology by acidification (0.1 N HCl) followed by low temperature sintering (110 °C) processes. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) constructed out of the material (cells of area 0.20 cm2 and thickness 12 μm) showed a power conversion efficiency (η) of 8.02% in comparison with commercial P-25 TiO2 (η = 6.1%).
Introduction
TiO2 is a versatile material having applications in various fields such as renewable energy harvesting (especially dye- and perovskite-sensitized solar cells (DSCs/PSSCs)),1–5 energy storage (Li-ion batteries, supercapacitors, etc.),6–8 photocatalysis (water splitting),9–12 environmental remediation,13–15 photonic crystals,16 self-cleaning coatings,17etc. For most of the applications mentioned above, TiO2 with a high surface area (and porosity) is preferred. There are two ways to increase the surface area of TiO2 in a TiO2 nanostructure: one is to reduce the size of the particles in the nanoarchitecture and the other is to increase its porosity. One-dimensional TiO2 nanostructures such as nanofibers, nanowires and nanotubes have found renewed interest for the abovementioned applications because of guided/semi-guided electron transport, scattering of solar photons corresponding to the red part of the solar spectrum, etc.18–20 However, the TiO2 nanofibers inherently have a low internal surface area, which is particularly true for the electrospun TiO2 nanofibers (∼44 m2 g−1).21,22 The fabrication of electrospun TiO2 nanofibers involves a high temperature sintering at 450 °C and during the process the sizes of the particles in the nanofiber architecture increase, which results in loss of surface area for the fibers.21,22 Further, the nanofibers are formed out of fusion of particles, which results in loss of the internal surface area for the former.21,22 Thus increasing the surface area of the electrospun TiO2 nanofibers through size reduction of constituting particles in the fibers is not a feasible approach. The second approach of roughening the surface through chemical means is a facile one. Previously we have shown that etching ZnO from the rice-shaped TiO2–ZnO composite leads to coral reef-shaped TiO2 nanostructures with good photovoltaic and photocatalytic properties.23 In the present paper we show that a soft etching of SiO2 from electrospun TiO2–SiO2 composite nanofibers with the in situ chemical transformation of the TiO2 using the sodium titanate process produces a fascinating morphology for the TiO2, which is yellow bristle grass-like. The TiO2 had a surface area of 113 m2 g−1 which when tested for a DSC showed a conversion efficiency of 8.02% for a cell of area 0.2 cm2 and thickness ∼12 μm. It must be noted that the present morphology appears only under mild reaction conditions24 (treatment with concentrated NaOH at 80 °C, ambient pressure), and under rigorous conditions (such as the hydrothermal reaction with concentrated NaOH, 180 °C in a typical steel-lined autoclave) the product was always 2-D (such as leaf) and 3-D (such as flowers) morphologies of TiO2.24–26
Experimental
Chemicals needed
PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone, Mw = 1.3 × 106, m.p. 300 °C, Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), methanol (Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany), acetic acid (LR, Nice Chemicals, India), titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TiP, 97%, Aldrich, Germany), tetraethoxysilane (TES, 98% GC grade, Alfa Aesar, UK), sodium hydroxide pellets (A.R., Nice Chemicals, India), hydrochloric acid (ACS, ISO Reag. Merck KGaA, Germany), and N719 dye (Solaronix SA) were used as received. Fluorine-doped tin oxide plates (FTO, a sheet resistance of 6–8 Ω □−1) were fabricated in-house by the spray-pyrolysis deposition method. The precursors of the FTO solution were prepared from dibutyltin diacetate (DBTDA) in 2-propanol (0.2 M) and ammonium fluoride (NH4F) in water (9 M).
Fabrication of TiO2–SiO2 composite nanofibers
The TiO2–SiO2 composite nanofibers (NFs) were fabricated by the electrospinning technique.24a Typically, about 1 g of PVP was dissolved in 14 mL of methanol followed by the addition of 4 mL of acetic acid, 1.75 mL of TiP and 0.25 mL of TES, respectively. The polymeric solution containing the precursors was subjected to continuous magnetic stirring for 5 h at room temperature to obtain sufficient viscosity and homogeneity for electrospinning. Electrospinning was done using a humidity-controlled electrospinning set-up (IME Technologies, The Netherlands) under the optimized conditions of 30 kV and with a flow rate of 1 mL h−1. The humidity level inside the electrospinning chamber was maintained at ∼50%. The as-spun composite fibers were collected on an Al foil which is wrapped to a static metallic collector. The distance between the needle tip and the collector was kept at 10 cm. The as-spun fibers were collected in the form of a white sheet on the Al foil which was peeled-off and sintered at 450 °C for 3 h for removing the polymer and crystallizing the TiO2–SiO2 composite. The as-spun composite (TiO2–SiO2–PVP) was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the sintered (TiO2–SiO2) nanofibers were analysed by spectroscopy and microscopy, respectively, as detailed below in the manuscript.
Synthesis of titanate fibers from the TiO2–SiO2 composite nanofibers
About 500 mg of the TiO2–SiO2 composite nanofibers was suspended in a 100 mL glass bottle containing 5 M NaOH solution without stirring. The glass bottle was subsequently kept in a hot air oven at 80 °C for 24 h. The TiO2–SiO2 composite has turned into a fluffy white precipitate of Na2Ti3O7 (sodium titanate) which was washed many times with deionized water and finally with methanol and dried in an oven at 60 °C. The titanate thus obtained was characterized with spectroscopic, microscopic and surface area measurements. The purpose of fabricating a composite architecture (TiO2–SiO2 composite fiber) was that SiO2 is an acidic metal oxide and can be easily etched using a base like NaOH during the titanate process. Etching of SiO2 from TiO2–SiO2 composite fibers would give higher surface area for sodium titanate.
Synthesis of titanate-derived yellow bristle grass-like TiO2 from the titanate fibers
The fluffy white titanate was suspended in dil. HCl (0.1 M HCl) at room temperature for 24 h. The resulting protonated titanate (H2Ti3O7) was then washed several times with deionized water and finally with methanol and dried in an oven at 110 °C for 24 h. During the heat treatment, H2Ti3O7 gets converted into TiO2 (the titanate-derived TiO2) with thorn-like features on the nanofiber backbone. The TiO2 was characterized by spectroscopy, microscopy and BET surface area analyses.
Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs)
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) were fabricated with the thorn-like TiO2 fibers by the doctor-blading technique. The polymer used for making the TiO2 paste was polyester which was prepared by the polycondensation of citric acid and ethylene glycol as reported before.25a About 100 mg of the TiO2 fibers was mixed with 100 μL of polyester and sonicated for 10 h to obtain a unique paste for doctor-blading. The TiO2 paste was doctor-bladed onto the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) plates which had a prior thin TiO2 coating (of ∼100 nm thickness) by the spray pyrolysis deposition method.25b The doctor-bladed films had a thickness of around 15 μm. We also prepared similar films from the commercially available P-25 for comparison. The doctor-bladed FTO plates were sintered at 450 °C for 1 h during which the polymer degraded and removed, resulting in an optimum electrode thickness of ∼11–12 μm for the TiO2. The porous TiO2 films were subsequently immersed in aq. TiCl4 solution (30 mM, 70 °C) for 30 min and again sintered at 450 °C for 1 h. The sintered electrodes were soaked in 0.5 mM N719 dye solution in a 1:1 acetonitrile–tert-butanol mixture for 24 h at room temperature and washed with absolute methanol for removing the loosely bound dyes. The electrodes having an active area of 0.25 cm2 were placed against platinum (Pt sputter-coated) counter-electrodes in the presence of a parafilm spacer and an I3−/I− electrolyte for DSC fabrication.
Characterization
The initial TiO2–SiO2 composite, sodium titanate and the final titanate-derived TiO2 were characterized by spectroscopy and microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using a JSM 6490 LA (JEOL-Tokyo, Japan) machine at an operating voltage of 15 kV. The samples spread on glass were coated with a thin film of gold before SEM measurements. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) was done with the JEOL 3010 machine at an operating voltage of 300 kV. A suspension of the samples was prepared in methanol under sonication and a drop of the solution was cast on a carbon-coated TEM grid which was subsequently dried in ambience and in a vacuum, respectively. The surface area of the materials was analyzed by the BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) N2 adsorption method using a BET analyzer (model no. Nova 1200 series from Quantachrome (USA)). Pore size distribution and average pore volume were estimated from the BET measurement using the manufacturer's software. The powder XRD measurements were performed on each sample by using an X'pert Pro PANalytical operated at 30 mA current and with a voltage of 40 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed with a machine from Kratos Analytical, UK. The materials were characterized by Raman spectroscopy as well as using a Witec Confocal Raman-300 AR instrument (with an excitation laser of 488 nm and a power of 0.6 mW). Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the DSCs were probed using a solar simulator under AM 1.5 G conditions (Newport Oriel Class A Solar Simulator, USA). The wavelength-dependent incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured using an Oriel Newport (QE-PV-SI/QE) IPCE Measurement kit, USA. The electron lifetime and recombination resistance of the DSCs were analyzed using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the dark at an applied bias voltage of 0.69 V by using an Autolab (Metrohm, Newport model, The Netherlands).
Results and discussion
Characterization of TiO2–SiO2 composite nanofibers, the intermediate sodium titanate and the final titanate-derived TiO2

Fig. 1 shows the SEM images of as-spun TiO2–SiO2–PVP composite nanofibers and the sintered TiO2–SiO2 nanofibers. Fibers were smooth and nearly continuous with an average diameter ranging from 200 to 250 nm (Fig. 1A and B). Upon sintering at 450 °C for 3 h, polymer degradation (reduction in the fiber diameter) and crystallization of the metal oxide grains occurred, which results in continuous composite fibers of TiO2–SiO2 of the 100–150 nm diameter range. Fig. 1C and D give details of TiO2–SiO2 composites after sintering. Fig. 2A shows a large area TEM image of TiO2–SiO2 nanofibers. Fig. 2B and C show the magnified image of a single nanofiber. Fig. 2D shows the high-resolution TEM image which indicates the amorphous nature of SiO2 in the TiO2–SiO2 composite.26–28 The lattice spacing of 0.35 nm corresponds to the (101) lattice and this indicates the anatase phase of TiO2 in the TiO2–SiO2 composites. Lattice spacing corresponding to the SiO2 was absent in the lattice-resolved image, implying that SiO2 is in an amorphous phase. The TiO2–SiO2 nanofibers were further analyzed by powder XRD, Raman spectroscopy, BET surface area and XPS measurements. The peaks in the XRD spectrum (Fig. 3A) further confirm the anatase phase of TiO2 and the amorphous nature of SiO2 in the composite (i.e. the absence of peaks corresponding to SiO2).28 From the Raman spectra (Fig. 3B) the bands at 152 cm−1, 430 cm−1 and 517 cm−1 show the anatase phase of TiO2 while the other peaks (612 cm−1 and 253 cm−1) indicate the amorphous SiO2.29 The BET surface area of the TiO2–SiO2 composites was 53 m2 g−1. Fig. 4A shows the XPS wide spectrum of the TiO2–SiO2 composite and the high-resolution spectra of the elements are shown in Fig. 4B–D. The binding energies of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 were centered at 458.46 eV and 464.16 eV, respectively, which corresponds to a spin–orbit coupling of 5.7 eV.28,30 The O 1s peak shown in Fig. 4C was de-convoluted into two peaks at 529.7 eV and 531 eV, respectively, corresponding to the presence of Ti–O–Ti and Si–O–Si bonds.31

This confirms the SiO2 incorporation into the TiO2 matrix through Ti–O–Si bonds.31 The peak for Si was centered at a binding energy of 102.01 eV as is evident from Fig. 4D.
On alkali treatment (i.e. by NaOH treatment), the TiO2–SiO2 composite was converted into sodium titanate (Na2Ti3O7) with the in situ leaching of the SiO2.32 The fiber morphology was well retained but the fibers became highly anisotropic and porous with thorn-like features all over the fiber backbone. Fig. 5A shows the EDS spectrum of the TiO2–SiO2 composites. The peaks for Si, O and Ti were clear from the spectrum. Fig. 5B shows the EDS spectrum of the Na2Ti3O7 showing the absence of Si, implying the near complete etching of SiO2 from the TiO2–SiO2 composite.

Fig. 6 shows the SEM images of the titanate showing the thorn-like features randomly decorating the fiber backbone. The TEM images of the titanate are shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7A shows the large area image of the fiber titanate and Fig. 7B–D show the resolved images of respective fibers. Fig. 7C and D show the HR-TEM images of the thorn-like features. Fig. 7E shows the layered nature of the Na2Ti3O7 and the layer spacing was found to be 0.8 nm, typical for sodium titanate materials.33,34 The SAED pattern in Fig. 7F shows the amorphous nature of sodium titanate. Fig. 8A and B show the powder XRD and Raman spectra of the titanate. The diffraction peak at 2θ = 9.7° (which is characteristic of the (200) peak of the titanate),33a,b and the absence of the TiO2 peaks in the XRD spectrum show that the conversion of the TiO2–SiO2 composite into the titanate was complete. From Raman analysis we clearly observe the bands at 295 cm−1, 722 cm−1, and 911 cm−1, respectively, and they confirm the material to be sodium titanate, Na2Ti3O7.

 Fig. 8  (A) Powder XRD spectrum and (B) Raman spectrum of the Na2Ti3O7. 
The peak at 295 cm−1 corresponds to the Na–O–Ti bond and the peak at 911 cm−1 can be attributed to the Ti–O stretching vibration in distorted TiO6 octahedra.33c The Raman band at 722 cm−1 represents the Ti–O–Ti stretch vibrational bond in edge-shared TiO6.33c The XPS spectrum of the titanate is given in Fig. 9A–D. The wide spectrum of the titanate shown in Fig. 9A implies the absence of the Si peak which further confirms the complete etching of Si during the formation of the titanate. The high-resolution spectrum of Ti shows the binding energies of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 centered at 458.4 eV and 464.1 eV, respectively. The O 1s peak (Fig. 9C) showed only a single peak at 530.07 eV corresponding to Ti–O–Ti bonds present in the material.34Fig. 9D indicates the presence of the Na 1s peak at 1070.4 eV which shows the formation of Ti–O–Na bonds in the Na2Ti3O7. The BET surface area of the Na2Ti3O7 was measured as 200 m2 g−1. A control Na2Ti3O7 was also prepared from electrospun TiO2 nanofibers (that is, without the incorporation of SiO2) by treatment with NaOH under similar conditions and the resulting Na2Ti3O7 showed a BET surface area of 166 m2 g−1. This highlights the role of SiO2 in the chemical transformation process. SiO2 is an acidic oxide which can be easily etched using NaOH. Thus when the TiO2–SiO2 composite fibers are treated with NaOH, the chemical transformation of TiO2 to the Na2Ti3O7 occur with the in situ etching of SiO2 from the composite. This is the reason for the high surface area of the Na2Ti3O7 obtained from TiO2–SiO2 composite fibers than that from TiO2 fibers.

The Na2Ti3O7 upon acid treatment (0.1 N HCl for 12 h) followed by washing (with water and ethanol several times) and low temperature sintering (110 °C) resulted in the conversion of Na2Ti3O7 into TiO2 (denoted as the titanate-derived TiO2 hereafter) with the same morphology as that of Na2Ti3O7, that is the fiber architecture with thorn-like features on the fiber backbone. The BET surface area of the TiO2 (113 m2 g−1) was lower than that of the Na2Ti3O7 (200 m2 g−1) but nearly double that of the TiO2–SiO2 composite (53 m2 g−1) and 2.5 times that of commercial P-25 TiO2. The average pore sizes and pore volumes of the Na2Ti3O7 and the TiO2 were 5.6 nm and 5.8 nm and 0.28 cc g−1 and 0.16 cc g−1, respectively. A comparison of the BET isotherms of the P-25 and the titanate-derived TiO2 is given in ESI 1.†
The TiO2 fibers were analyzed by microscopy. Fig. 10 and 11, respectively, show the SEM and TEM images. Low- and high-resolution SEM images (Fig. 10A and B) show a nearly similar morphology of the Na2Ti3O7 for TiO2 as well, i.e. thorn-like features on the fiber architecture resulting in a completely anisotropic morphology. The large area and resolved TEM images (Fig. 11A and B) also show the thorn-like morphology of the TiO2 fibers. Fig. 11C shows the lattice-resolved TEM image of the TiO2 which confirms its anatase structure with the lattice spacing of 0.35 nm corresponding to the (101) orientation of the anatase TiO2. The SAED pattern shown by Fig. 11D indicates its polycrystalline nature. The TiO2 was further characterized using powder XRD and Raman spectra (Fig. 12), respectively. The XRD pattern of TiO2 further confirms its crystallinity and anatase nature, i.e. the prominent peak at 2θ = 25°.35 The peaks are indexed in the spectrum itself and the average particle size of ∼12 nm was calculated from the full-width at half maximum of the major (101) peak by the Debye–Scherrer formula. The major peaks in the Raman spectrum show that it is anatase TiO2. According to the factor group analysis from the 15 optical modes (1A1g + 1A2u + 2B1g + 1B2u + 3Eg + 2Eu), six Raman active modes (A1g, 2B1g and 3Eg) correspond to the anatase phase.36 The peaks at 640 cm−1, 200 cm−1, 156 cm−1 show the three Eg vibrational modes and the peaks 398 cm−1 and 515 cm−1 represent the Bg1 and Ag1 vibrational modes, respectively. XPS analysis was done to confirm the elemental composition and phase purity of TiO2 (Fig. 13). The binding energies of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 were centered at 458.43 eV and 464.13 eV, respectively, corresponding to a spin–orbit coupling of 5.7 eV. The single peak for O 1s at 530.11 eV corresponds to Ti–O–Ti bonds in the TiO2, which further confirms the absence of oxygen related impurities in the TiO2.

Photovoltaic properties of the titanate-derived TiO2
We fabricated DSCs out of commercial P-25 TiO2, TiO2 nanofibers and titanate-derived TiO2 for comparing their photovoltaic performance (Fig. 14A). The photovoltaic parameters of the DSC using P-25 were conversion efficiency (η) of 6.04% with a current density (Jsc) of 10.78 mA cm−2, a fill-factor (FF) of 73.55% and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 761 mV. The TiO2 nanofiber (electrospun TiO2)25 DSC achieved a η of 5.51% with a Jsc of 10.25 mA cm−2, a FF of 71.27% and a Voc of 753 mV. The DSC using titanate-derived TiO2 gave a pretty decent performance compared to the above two. It gave a η of 8.02% with a Jsc of 14.48 mA cm−2, a FF of about 73.55% and a Voc of 770 mV. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the device was ∼78% whereas the same was ∼58% for the P-25-based DSC.
 Fig. 14  (A) J–V characteristics of DSCs of films using titanate-derived TiO2 and P-25; (B) the IPCE (%) of DSCs using titanate-derived TiO2 and P-25. 
We have analyzed the reasons for the superior performance of the titanate-derived TiO2 in comparison with the P-25. A comparison of the photovoltaic parameters reveals that high Jsc and Voc of the DSC from titanate-derived TiO2 are the reasons for its high efficiency. The BET surface area of the titanate-derived TiO2 was measured to be 113 m2 g−1 which was ∼2.5 times higher than that of the commercial P-25 (∼44 m2 g−1) (ESI 1†). We have quantified the amount of dyes in the DSCs (cells having the same thickness and area, respectively) by de-loading them using 0.1 N NaOH. A comparison of the dye-loading data is given in Fig. 15A, which shows enhanced dye adsorption on the titanate-derived TiO2 than that in the P-25 (owing to the high surface area of the former). Thus high dye loading partly contributed to the increased photocurrent density (Jsc). The TiO2 nanofibers had an average diameter of ∼250 nm, tens of microns length and a highly roughened surface with thorn-like features projecting out from the fiber backbone. The dimensions and surface features of the fibers were also apt for good light scattering especially at the red part of the solar spectrum. We measured the reflectance of the electrodes from titanate-derived TiO2 fibers and the P-25 (Fig. 15B). It can be seen that the titanate TiO2 fibers scattered more photons at the red part of the spectrum than the P-25, implying more photon confinement within the TiO2 fiber electrode. This also might have contributed to the increased Jsc value.
 Fig. 15  A comparison of the dye-loading (A), reflectance (B) data on the two electrodes. (C) The Nyquist plot and (D) the Bode phase plot of two DSCs in the dark are also shown. 
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the DSCs were recorded under dark conditions at an applied forward bias of 0.7 V to find the recombination resistance values. The EIS result is depicted in the Nyquist plot (Fig. 15C). The Nyquist plot for an ideal DSC device will show three semicircles corresponding to charge transfer at the counter electrode–electrolyte interface (appears in the high frequency range), charge transfer at the oxide–electrolyte interface (Rct) (appears in the medium frequency range) and ion diffusion through the electrolyte (appears in the lower frequency range). The recombination resistance (middle frequency) is more for the titanate-derived TiO2 (larger semicircle) than for the P-25 (smaller semicircle), implying reduced electron recombination for the former. This is further evident from the lifetime of the electrons in the respective DSCs measured from the Bode phase plots (Fig. 15D). The lifetime of the electrons is related to the peak of the Bode phase plot by using the relation: Ts = 1/2πfpeak, where fpeak corresponds to the frequency maximum. The respective electron lifetimes were calculated to be 13 ms and 16 ms for P-25 and the titanate-derived TiO2. The increased lifetime of electrons in the fiber DSC implies reduced electron recombination, which is reflected in the increased Voc and Jsc of the DSC prepared from titanate derived TiO2. While reduced recombination is one of the reasons for the observed high Voc, yet another reason can be the chemical composition of the TiO2. The titanate TiO2 nanofiber is phase pure (anatase), and the P-25 is a mixture of ∼75% anatase (band-gap of 3.2 eV) and ∼25% rutile (band-gap of 3.0 eV). Thus the apparent Fermi level of P-25 will be slightly lower than that of the titanate TiO2 and hence the observed variations in the Voc. Thus it can be summarized that the high Jsc and Voc are the primary reasons for the enhanced performance of the titanate-derived TiO2 in comparison with the P-25 TiO2.
Conclusions
TiO2 nanofibers resembling the morphology of yellow bristle grass were fabricated from TiO2–SiO2 composite nanofibers by a soft chemical transformation and etching process. The soft etching process also involved chemical transformation of TiO2 with the in situ etching of SiO2 by concentrated NaOH at room temperature and ambient pressure. The initial TiO2–SiO2 composite fibers, the chemically transformed Na2Ti3O7 fibers and the titanate-derived TiO2 fibers with the morphology of yellow bristle grass were characterized by spectroscopy and microscopy. A comparison of the dye-sensitized solar cell performance of the commercially available P-25, the TiO2 nanofibers and the present TiO2 with the yellow bristle grass morphology showed a superior performance for the final one (an efficiency of 8.02% vs. that for the commercial P-25 TiO2, 6.039%). We anticipate many promising applications for the titanate-derived TiO2 in anti-reflecting coatings, Li-ion battery, environmental remediation, etc.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  SEM images of (A and B) as-spun TiO2–SiO2–PVP composite nanofibers and (C and D) TiO2–SiO2 composite nanofibers after sintering at 450 °C.	 

 	Fig. 2  TEM analysis: (A) the large area TEM image of TiO2–SiO2 nanofibers, (B) and (C) show magnified images of a few nanofibers and a single nanofiber respectively and (D) shows a lattice-resolved TEM image of a single TiO2–SiO2 nanofiber where the red circled area indicates the regions of amorphous SiO2 and the lattice spacing of 0.35 nm shows anatase TiO2.	 

 	Fig. 3  XRD (A) and Raman (B) analysis of TiO2–SiO2 composites.	 

 	Fig. 4  XPS wide spectrum (A) of TiO2–SiO2 composites and the high-resolution spectra of Ti (B), O (C) and Si (D), respectively.	 

 	Fig. 5  EDS spectrum of (A) the TiO2–SiO2 composite and (B) sodium titanate. A small hump seen around 2 eV (in B) could be due to the Si impurity (maybe from incomplete washing).	 

 	Fig. 6  SEM results of titanates showing thorn-like figures that originate from the fiber backbone.	 

 	Fig. 7  TEM images of sodium titanate. (A) The large area TEM image while resolved images are shown in (B)–(D). Image (E) corresponds to an HR-TEM image of the titanate showing its layered nature. The SAED pattern is shown in (F).	 

 	Fig. 8  (A) Powder XRD spectrum and (B) Raman spectrum of the Na2Ti3O7.	 

 	Fig. 9  XPS wide spectrum (A) of Na2Ti3O7 showing complete etching of SiO2 and the presence of Na. High-resolution spectra of Ti (B), O (C) and Na (D).	 

 	Fig. 10  SEM analysis of TiO2 in various resolutions further confirms its anisotropic morphology.	 

 	Fig. 11  TEM analysis of TiO2 nanofibers ((A) and (B) show the large area and resolved TEM images). The lattice spacing (0.35 nm of 101 orientations) shown in (C) and (D) shows the SAED pattern of the same.	 

 	Fig. 12  (A) Powder XRD and (B) Raman spectra of titanate derived TiO2 nanofibers.	 

 	Fig. 13  XPS wide spectrum of TiO2 (A) and the high-resolution spectra of Ti (B) and O (C), respectively.	 

 	Fig. 14  (A) J–V characteristics of DSCs of films using titanate-derived TiO2 and P-25; (B) the IPCE (%) of DSCs using titanate-derived TiO2 and P-25.	 

 	Fig. 15  A comparison of the dye-loading (A), reflectance (B) data on the two electrodes. (C) The Nyquist plot and (D) the Bode phase plot of two DSCs in the dark are also shown.
