    , Accepted 15th June 2018First published on 21st June 2018AbstractIn this paper, an efficient p-type polymer semiconductor (PASQ-IDT) is first developed by integrating a two-dimensional (2D) structure concept into the design of squaraine-based π-conjugated polymers, and it shows multiple applications in both bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ-PSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) with high performance. As the polymer-donor blended with a fullerene acceptor, PASQ-IDT can endow the derived additive-free single-junction PSCs and semi-transparent PSCs with impressive efficiencies of 6.35% and 4.03%, respectively, both of which are the highest values reported for polysquaraines. More encouragingly, PASQ-IDT not only exhibits good hole extraction/transport ability, but also shows very good surface wettability to the perovskite precursor solution to enable the growth of perovskites with high film quality, making it suitable as an efficient hole transporting material (HTM) for inverted PVSCs. Thus, a very promising efficiency of 18.29% with negligible hysteresis and good device stability can be delivered by PASQ-IDT-based inverted PVSCs in the absence of dopants, outperforming the PEDOT:PSS-based control devices (16.14%) and most dopant-free HTMs reported so far.
Introduction
Squaraines, as efficient light-harvesting materials, have been widely used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs), owing to their facile synthetic access, intense and broad absorption in the visible to near-infrared (NIR) window region, and remarkable photochemical, oxygen and moisture stability.1–4 A variety of squaraine-based electron donor materials have been developed, and they can generally be divided into symmetrical squaraines (SSQs, D–A–D) and asymmetrical squaraines (ASQs, D–A–D′) depending on their structural difference. Based on a classical SSQ, namely 2,4-bis[4-(N,N-diisobutylamino)-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl]squaraine, single-junction BHJ-OSCs with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.3% have been reported.5 However, SSQs often suffer from poor solubility and processibility, leading to their solution-processed cells exhibiting inferior performance relative to vacuum-deposited ones.6–8 In fact, the above PCE of 6.3% was derived from vacuum-deposited cells.
By contrast, ASQs generally have good solubility, and particularly exhibit more flexibility for synthetic manipulation through combining different types of electron donor units, thus enabling greater possibilities for tuning their optoelectronic properties.2 Nonetheless, ASQ-based OSCs have commonly presented relatively poor photovoltaic performance in earlier reports,9–12 making them receive little research attention for a long time. Encouragingly, various new molecular design strategies have recently been explored to improve their photovoltaic performance effectively.13–16 For example, Kido et al. designed and synthesized a new type of ASQ dimer consisting of a large π-extended conjugation system, and impressive PCEs of ∼7% with low optical loss can be achieved for solution-processed single-junction BHJ-OSCs.16
It was reported that one of the major drawbacks for squaraine-based donor materials is their relatively low hole transport capacities that often provide the fabricated OSCs with unsatisfactory fill factors (FFs) and thus limited efficiencies.3,4 According to Kido's recent reports,15,16 the incorporation of squaraines into a large π-extended conjugated system can be beneficial to facilitating intermolecular interactions, and thus enhanced hole mobility exceeding 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 was achieved. In this context, synthesis of π-conjugated polysquaraines could also be one alternative strategy. However up to now, π-conjugated polysquaraines have been less explored in polymer solar cells (PSCs),17–19 since very low PCEs of ∼1% were always obtained. This is possibly due to a lack of appropriate molecular design of the polymeric structure. So far, most of the reported π-conjugated polysquaraines, either homo- or co-polymers, have exhibited a one-dimensional (1D) main-chain structure based on SSQ units,17–22 in which strong exciton coupling between localized squaraines often occurs. Moreover, Lambert et al. recently revealed that two structural conformations (i.e. zigzag- and helix-type) can be generated within a single squaraine homopolymer strand, resulting in a fast, efficient intra-chain energy transfer that could limit the generation and diffusion of excitons.23
Over the past few years, integration of a two-dimensional (2D) structure concept into the design of polymer donors in PSCs has achieved great success, and the very first example of the PCE breaking the 10% barrier in the OPV field comes from a 2D polymer donor.24 A 2D structure could allow strong but controlled inter-chain π–π interactions to enhance the hole mobility and favor the formation of a nanoscale morphology simultaneously, both of which are necessary for realizing high FFs.25–27 From this point of view, it should be very interesting to synthesize squaraine-based 2D conjugated polymers for PSCs, which, however, has not been reported yet. Here, we report the first example of a pseudo-2D conjugated polysquaraine, namely PASQ-IDT (Scheme 1), as an efficient polymer donor for PSCs, yielding an encouraging PCE of 6.35% with a high FF of 0.58 for solution-processed single-junction BHJ PSCs, which are the highest values for polysquaraine-based donors. Moreover, due to the narrow and intense absorption in the NIR window, PASQ-IDT is also suitable for fabricating semi-transparent PSCs, and the devices using thin Ag cathodes (13 nm) showed a satisfactory PCE of over 4% with an average visible transmittance (400–700 nm) of ∼28%.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route to PASQ-IDT. 
In parallel with PSCs, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have also recently been considered as the next-generation photovoltaic technology owing to their remarkably impressive research progress achieved within a short time.28–32 So far, a record PCE of over 22% has been reported.33 In addition to optimizing the material compositions and processing techniques,34,35 charge-transporting layers (CTLs) that can help to extract and transport holes/electrons from the perovskite layer to the electrolytes play a key role in boosting the performance of PVSCs.36–43 For inverted p–i–n PVSCs, the widely used organic hole transporting materials (HTMs) are conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) derivatives due to their high conductivity, good wettability and mild processing conditions.44 However, PEDOT:PSS always suffers from a large potential loss due to a mismatched work function. Besides, its inherent acidic and hygroscopic nature is detrimental to the long-term device stability. As a result, further strategies of modifying PEDOT:PSS such as chemical film doping are strongly required,45–47 which, however, make the derived device fabrication more complicated. In this context, development of novel dopant-free CPEs as promising alternatives to PEDOT:PSS is highly desirable.48–52 Thus, considering that PASQ-IDT can be considered as a class of zwitterionic CPEs, its effectiveness as a dopant-free HTM in inverted PVSCs was carefully tested, and the results encouragingly showed that PASQ-IDT can work well, and the derived champion PVSCs show a promising PCE of 18.29% associated with good device stability.
Results and discussion
The synthetic route to PASQ-IDT is shown in Scheme 1, which is indeed simple, while the synthetic details are described in the ESI.† First, compound 1 was prepared via a typical Ullmann reaction between 3,5-dimethoxyaniline and 1-bromo-4-iodobenzene, and was further subjected to a deprotection reaction in the presence of BBr3 to afford a triphenylamine-based end-capping group (2). Then, compound 2 was condensed with benzo[e]indole-functionalized semi-squaraine (3) to obtain the asymmetrical squaraine 4 with an isolated yield of 47%. Finally, the target copolymer PASQ-IDT with a 2D structure was obtained through a simple Stille coupling copolymerization between 4 and an indacenodithiophene unit (IDT-Sn). PASQ-IDT is readily soluble in common organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform, and chlorobenzene at room temperature. Its molecular weight was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using THF as an eluent, and a weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of 38600 g mol−1 with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.68 was obtained (Fig. S2†).
UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of squaraine 4 and PASQ-IDT in chloroform solution and thin films were measured to investigate their photophysical properties. As shown in Fig. 1a, PASQ-IDT gives an absorption maximum at 689 nm in solution, a bathochromic shift of 26 nm relative to that of monomeric squaraine 4, indicating that exciton coupling occurs between monomeric squaraine units in the polymer chain to some extent; however, the coupling efficiency is much lower than that in a 1D polysquaraine chain.21 Besides, the absorption peak at 457 nm should correspond to the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone consisting of IDT units. The extinction coefficients of monomer 4 and PASQ-IDT were determined to be 1.86 × 105 and 1.53 × 105 M−1 cm−1, respectively. It is worth noting that PASQ-IDT retains well the absorption characteristics of squaraines with a sharp transition and large extinction coefficient, and its absorption band is only slightly broadened compared to that of 4 (0.195 eV vs. 0.131 eV).

In thin films, both absorption spectra of PASQ-IDT and 4 (Fig. 2b) present increased band-broadening by comparison with their corresponding solution spectra, indicating that aggregation occurs in the solid state. However, PASQ-IDT exhibits a much sharper film absorption band than 4 (0.347 eV vs. 0.492 eV). Likewise, no change in the absorption maximum from the solution to the film state is observed for PASQ-IDT, while a bathochromic shift of 26 nm is found for monomer 4. Additionally, there is a strong shoulder peak at 629 nm appearing in the spectrum of 4, an indication of H-type aggregation. These observations thus strongly suggest that the aggregation of squaraines could be alleviated with the formed 2D structure. This can be further explained by geometry simulation results (Fig. S3†) of the analogous dimer model through employing density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G level, which reveals that the optimal backbone geometry of PASQ-IDT is highly twisted and the neighboring squaraine units appear at the opposite sides of the backbone. The film absorption band edge of PASQ-IDT is ∼804 nm, corresponding to a low optical Eg of 1.54 eV.

Fig. 1c shows the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve of PASQ-IDT measured in N2 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, indicating good thermal stability with an onset thermal decomposition temperature (Td, corresponding to a 5% weight loss) of 296 °C. Moreover, no clear melting or glass transition was observed in the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) in the temperature range of 20–250 °C (Fig. S4†). The electrochemical properties of PASQ-IDT were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. As shown in Fig. 1d, the oxidation onset of PASQ-IDTversus Fc/Fc+ (0.43 V) was determined to be 0.36 V, corresponding to a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of −5.16 eV based on the equation EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.80) (eV). Such a relatively deep HOMO level could be beneficial to achieving large Voc in PSCs. Then using the equation ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg,opt, the lowest occupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level was calculated to be −3.62 eV. The electronic densities of the HOMO and LUMO wave functions (Fig. 2) were also simulated by the DFT method, and the results demonstrate that the IDT units and triphenylamine-based end-capping groups contribute significantly to the HOMO, but the LUMO orbital densities predominantly locate at the cyclobutadione bridge in the squaraine unit. The calculated HOMO/LUMO levels based on this dimeric model are −4.53/−2.43 eV, corresponding to a bandgap of 2.1 eV.
To determine the potential of PASQ-IDT as a donor material in PSCs, single-junction solar cells were fabricated using the conventional device configuration of ITO/MoO3/PASQ-IDT:PC71BM/BCP/Al (Fig. 3a) and investigated under the simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The BHJ layers were deposited by spin-coating the polymer/PC71BM chlorobenzene solution without any additive. More details of the device fabrication and characterization can be found in the Experimental section in the ESI.† The blending ratio of the donor/acceptor (D/A) in the BHJ layer was carefully optimized to tune the absorption and charge transport properties, and the corresponding current–voltage (J–V) curves are illustrated in Fig. 3b with the device parameters summarized in Table 1. As shown, upon optimizing the D/A weight ratio from 1/1 to 1/7, an obvious change in the resulting photovoltaic performance was observed. The best-performing ratio was found to be 1/5, leading to an impressive PCE of 6.35% with a Voc of 820 mV, a Jsc of 13.41 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.58. This is the highest PCE value reported for polysquaraine-based donor materials so far,17–19 and is even in the top three taking into consideration all squaraine-based single-junction solar cells.3–16 The results shown here strongly suggest that our molecular design strategy of preparing 2D conjugated polysquaraine is quite feasible to achieve efficient squaraine-based donor materials for OPVs.

The major changes resulting from increasing the weight ratio of the PC71BM acceptor are observed for Jsc and FF, which increased from 8.26 mA cm−2 to 13.41 mA cm−2, and from 0.41 to 0.58, respectively. It is worth noting that the FF value of 0.58 is also among the best for solution-processed squaraine-based solar cells.12–19 To elucidate the origin of the enhanced Jsc, we measured the absorption spectra of blend films with different D/A weight ratios (Fig. 3c), which showed that the absorption in the range of 500–600 nm becomes intensified due to the contribution from P71BM and thus can be complementary to the pristine film absorption of PASQ-IDT (Fig. 1b). However we also noted that upon increasing the acceptor ratio, the absorption intensity of PASQ-IDT (600–800 nm) decreased. Thus, the device external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra based on different D/A blending ratios were also studied (Fig. 3d). As shown, the EQE from 300 to 800 nm significantly increased upon changing the blending ratio from 1:1 to 1:3. When the blending ratio was varied from 1:3 to 1:5, the EQE from 600 to 800 nm showed a negligible change, while that between 300 and 600 nm had increased. Further increasing the acceptor ratio to 1:7 only resulted in a decrease of EQE from 600 to 800 nm. These results therefore are quite consistent with the change of Jsc values, implying that increasing the PC71BM ratio in the blend films could favor light-harvesting to enhance Jsc.53
In addition to absorption, charge carrier mobility and morphology also play key roles in affecting Jsc and FF. Thus, the mobility of the pristine PASQ-IDT and PASQ-IDT/PC71BM blend film samples was characterized by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. Based on hole-only devices with the structure of ITO/MoO3/sample/MoO3/Al, the pristine PASQ-IDT film showed a good hole mobility (μh) of 4.11 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S5a†); however, the blend film with a D/A weight ratio of 1/5 showed an enhanced μh of 8.36 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S5b†), which is possibly due to the morphology change induced by blending. We then studied the packing behaviors of the polymer chain in the thin film state by X-ray diffraction (XRD); however no diffraction peak was observed for both the pristine and blend films of PASQ-IDT as shown in Fig. S6.† Nonetheless, it is interestingly found that after forming blend films, the absorption of PASQ-IDT showed a clear red-shift, over 10 nm, which, to some degree, may be an indication of enhanced π–π packing. The enhanced hole mobility due to blending results in more balanced hole/electron transport as the electron mobility of PC71BM was determined to be 3.11 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Fig. S5c†).
The morphology of the BHJ films with different D/A weight ratios was also evaluated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 4, all BHJ layers showed small domain sizes and smooth surfaces with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of around 1 nm without any large-scale phase separation. This, to a large degree, could be attributed to the unique 2D structure of PASQ-IDT that potentially produces excellent compatibility with the fullerene acceptors. Interestingly, upon decreasing the D/A weight ratio, the RMS values decreased accordingly, indicating the formation of a more uniform interpenetrating network.

Although the PCE of 6.35% is among the best for squaraine-based donor materials, we have to recognize that there is still a gap when comparing with state-of-the-art OSCs,24,54 which could be attributed to their low Jsc and FF values. Next, further increasing the contribution of squaraine components to Jsc by tuning their optical properties and enhancing their hole mobility is highly desirable. Moreover, it is also important to design squaraine-based donor materials suitable for non-fullerene OSCs, which may be an efficient way to further boost the photovoltaic performance of squaraine-based semiconductors.
Moreover, by checking the EQE spectrum of conventional PASQ-IDT-based solar cells (Fig. 4d), a transparency window between the visible wavelengths can be found obviously, enabling us to fabricate the semi-transparent solar cells having the same device structure as discussed above but using a much thinner Ag cathode (13 nm). As shown in Fig. 5a, an average visible transmittance value of ∼28% was obtained in the wavelength range from 400 to 700 nm, and based on this transmittance, the best-performing semi-transparent solar cell can produce a PCE of 4.03% (Fig. 5b) with a Voc of 787 mV, a Jsc of 10.00 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.51. Given that semitransparent devices generally have an inferior performance compared to normal devices with a highly reflective metal electrode, the device results achieved here are really encouraging. We also have to note that this is the first report, to the best of our knowledge, of fabricating squaraine-based semi-transparent solar cells, which could open a new avenue of taking advantage of squaraine-based semiconductors.

Until now, conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) such as PEDOT:PSS derivatives have been the dominant HTMs used in inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs).44,55 However, as mentioned in the Introduction, the commonly used PEDOT:PSS is not an ideal HTM due to its mismatched work function and the inherent acidic and hygroscopic nature. Although other p-type semiconducting polymers such as poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA) have been used to replace PEDOT:PSS successfully, they often need p-type chemical doping by adding external ionic dopants to attain high device performance,56 which not only increases the overall cost of device fabrication, but also deteriorates the long-term device stability. In addition, small molecule based dopant-free HTMs have also been designed and prepared to produce highly efficient inverted PVSCs.57–59 Nonetheless, most of the small molecules were not able to resist the solvation of polar solvents (DMF and DMSO), which are typical processing solvents for perovskite precursors.58 In this regard, development of novel dopant-free polymer HTMs is urgently needed for inverted PVSCs.
Recently, π-conjugated polymers for multiple applications in both BHJ PSCs and PVSCs were also reported with high performance.60–62 However, squaraine-based HTMs for PVSCs have rarely been studied so far.63 Here, PASQ-IDT exhibits a good hole mobility (4.11 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and suitable HOMO energy level (−5.16 eV) that fulfill the requirements of a HTM for PVSCs. More importantly, it could be regarded as a zwitterionic CPE that can potentially provide good surface wettability to the perovskite precursor solution. From this standpoint, it is valuable to exploit the effectiveness of PASQ-IDT as the dopant-free HTM in inverted PVSCs. Thus, inverted planar devices with the configuration of ITO/PASQ-IDT/perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag were fabricated (Fig. 6a) and MAPbI3 (MA: CH3NH3+) was used as the active light-harvesting layer. The device fabrication details are provided in the Experimental section in the ESI.†

(f) The stability test of PASQ-IDT-based inverted PVSCs in ambient air with a humidity of 20–25%. 
For HTMs used in inverted devices, another key requirement is that they must be transparent enough to avoid light loss. Since PASQ-IDT has its absorption in the visible window, we thus characterized the transmission spectrum (Fig. S7†) of its thin film processed under the same conditions as those used for fabricating the HTM layer. A high transparency of 98.8% in the wavelength range of 350–800 nm was observed, suggesting that PASQ-IDT should not affect the light-harvesting capability of perovskites. Moreover, water contact angle measurements revealed that PASQ-IDT has a much larger contact angle of 70° (Fig. S8†) than PEDOT:PSS,57 while AFM showed a smooth surface with a RMS roughness of 0.566 (Fig. S9†). Such a hydrophobic and smooth HTM layer could favor the growth of perovskite grains on its surface with high film quality. We further studied the work functions of ITO and ITO with PASQ-IDT film deposited as shown in Fig. S10,† and the results clearly showed that the deposition of the polymer film onto the ITO substrate does not affect the work function of ITO (4.79 eV vs. 4.74 eV).
The energy-level alignments of PASQ-IDT relative to perovskites and PEDOT:PSS are shown in Fig. 6b, indicating that they can fulfill the requirements of hole transport/extraction. Moreover, very ordered and vertically aligned grain boundaries can be observed in the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the device (Fig. S11†), which could thus be beneficial to charge carrier transport. The effect of PASQ-IDT film thickness was studied through tuning the processing solution concentration in chlorobenzene (0.6 mg L−1, 1.0 mg L−1 and 2.0 mg mL−1), and the resulting device performance is shown in Fig. S12,† which shows that the HTM layer with a thickness of ∼25 nm processed from a 1.0 mg mL−1 solution can provide the best PCEs. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best-performing inverted PVSCs are shown in Fig. 6c, and in the absence of dopants, they are able to deliver a very impressive PCE of 18.29% with a Voc of 1.03 V, a Jsc of 22.18 mA cm−2, and a FF of 80%, which is not only much higher than that of PEDOT:PSS-based control device (16.14%, Fig. S13†), but also among the best for the dopant-free devices reported so far. The PCE histogram is inserted in Fig. 6c, and it shows very good reproducibility of the fabricated PVSCs with an average PCE of ∼17.69% (among 20 devices).
A negligible hysteresis was observed through forward and reverse scans as illustrated in Fig. 6c and Table S1,† which may be attributed to efficient hole extraction, as well as enhanced contact between the HTM and the perovskite layer due to the zwitterionic structure of PASQ-IDT. Furthermore, we also evaluated the stabilized photocurrent of the best-performing PVSCs (Fig. 6d) measured at 0.88 V near the maximum power point, and a steady-state PCE of ∼18.12% with a Jsc of 20.58 mA cm−2 was clearly obtained. Besides, the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of the champion device was measured (Fig. 6e), wherein the integrated Jsc value (20.94 mA cm−2) is consistent with that obtained from experimental J–V measurements. These results can thus confirm the reliability of high performance. As reported in our earlier work64 and referenced work,46 the inherent acidic and hygroscopic nature of PEDOT:PSS often induces a terrible device stability. To check if the hydrophobic nature and absence of dopants can improve the device stability of PVSCs, we examined the device environmental stability derived from dopant-free PASQ-IDT without encapsulation, while the decay curves are shown in Fig. 6f. All the device parameters showed a slow decay when being stored in ambient air under a relative humidity of 20–25%. After 500 h, the device can still retain ∼90% of its original PCE, while the reduction of PCE was mainly due to the decrease of FF.
The charge transfer behaviors of bi-layered perovskite/dopant-free HTM films were carefully studied to understand the origin of the photovoltaic characteristics from PASQ-IDT. As shown in Fig. 7a, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra showed that the strong fluorescence of perovskites can be efficiently quenched in the presence of PASQ-IDT. Time-resolved PL decay curves are given in Fig. 7b. The pristine perovskite film exhibits a PL decay time (τ) of 246.25 ns; however, after the introduction of the HTM layer, the τ value can be shortened to 15.38 ns. Such significant PL quenching and decrease in the PL decay lifetime are clear indications of an efficient hole extraction from the valence band of perovskites into the HOMO level of PASQ-IDT.

(d) Top-view SEM image of the perovskite film atop a PASQ-IDT film. 
In addition to providing efficient hole extraction/transport, another critical function for HTMs in inverted PVSCs is to affect the growth of perovskites. Here we found that the PASQ-IDT film can display excellent surface wettability to the precursor solution of perovskites during coating of perovskite films, in spite of having a hydrophobic surface (Fig. S4†). This is quite similar to the phenomenon observed from one well-known HTM, poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA).56 To study this abnormal phenomenon, the contact angle of PASQ-IDT film to a DMF drop was measured, and a very small value of 9° which is comparable to that of PEDOT:PSS (11°) but much lower than that of P3HT (50°) was obtained. As well-demonstrated in referenced work,56,65 good surface wettability of the HTM could help the growth of perovskites with high film quality to realize high performance PVSCs. To verify this, the surface SEM (Fig. 7d) of the perovskite film atop PASQ-IDT was characterized, in which a high film quality was obtained with a large crystal grain size, homogeneous surface coverage and minimal pin-holes. This abnormal surface energy of the PASQ-IDT film is possibly attributed to the zwitterionic structure as a result of the inclusion of squaraines, which are hydrophobic but provide close interfacial contact with perovskites.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we successfully developed a new pseudo-two-dimensional conjugated polysquaraine (PASQ-IDT) as an efficient p-type semiconductor applicable in organic photovoltaics and perovskite solar cells. As the polymer donor blended with a PC71BM acceptor with an optimized D/A weight ratio of 1:5, the derived PASQ-IDT-based additive-free single-junction BHJ PSCs can produce an impressive PCE of 6.35% with a high FF of 0.58, mainly attributed to the more balanced charge transfer and uniform interpenetrating network in the BHJ layer. In addition, it is also suitable for fabricating semi-transparent PSCs due to the narrow and intense absorption in the NIR window, while a satisfactory PCE of over 4% with an average visible transmittance (400–700 nm) of ∼28% has been achieved. More encouragingly, PASQ-IDT can be further used as an efficient dopant-free HTM in inverted PVSCs to generate a very promising PCE of 18.29% with negligible hysteresis and good device stability. We demonstrated that in addition to having good hole extraction/transport ability, PASQ-IDT also provides very good surface wettability to the perovskite precursor solution that can be beneficial to the growth of perovskites to form high quality films. On the basis of these findings, we believe that this work shows a new molecular design strategy of taking advantage of old squaraines to develop efficient p-type polymer semiconductors.
