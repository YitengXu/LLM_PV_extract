    , Accepted 25th October 2017First published on 26th October 2017AbstractWe designed and synthesized two novel non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (IDT-N and IDT-T-N) that consist of indacenodithiophene (IDT) as the electron-donating core and 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-cyclopenta[b]naphthalen-1-ylidene)malononitrile (N) as a novel electron-withdrawing end group. IDT-N and IDT-T-N consisting of the naphthyl-based N group exhibited an expanded plane compared to phenyl-based indanone (INCN), which strengthened the intramolecular push–pull effect between the core donor unit and the terminal acceptor units. This strengthened effect resulted in a reduced bandgap that was beneficial for solar photon collection and increased short-circuit current density of the resulting devices. IDT-N and IDT-T-N exhibited red-shifted absorptions and smaller optical bandgaps than the corresponding phenyl-fused indanone end-capped chromophores. Both acceptors exhibited broad absorptions and energy levels that were well-matched with the donor materials. Polymer solar cells based on IDT-N and IDT-T-N and two representative polymer donors (PTB7-Th and PBDB-T) exhibited impressive photovoltaic performances. The devices based on the PBDB-T:IDT-N system exhibited a power conversion efficiency of up to 9.0%, with a short-circuit current density of 15.88 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of 71.91%. These results demonstrate that IDT-N and IDT-T-N are promising electron acceptors for use in polymer solar cells.
1. Introduction
Over the past two decades, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as promising candidates for solar energy collection. PSCs are typically lightweight, inexpensive, and flexible, and can be fabricated using roll-to-roll coating techniques.1–5 Fullerene and its derivatives have been widely used as acceptors in PSCs because of their high electron transport capacities, high electron affinities, and ability to form suitable phase separation when blending with donor materials in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells.6–10 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of greater than 11% have been achieved in devices based on fullerene derivatives, owing to the rapid development of polymeric donor materials.11–16 However, the limitations of fullerene materials, such as the high costs of synthesis and purification, low absorption coefficients in the visible light region, and strong aggregation (resulting in poor stability), have impeded further development of PSCs. To address these issues, polymeric and small-molecule non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have been incorporated into PSCs.17–20 NFAs typically exhibit strong and broad absorption and a wide range of energy levels and can be synthesized easily and cost-effectively.21–26 Moreover, small-molecule acceptors possess well-defined molecular weights and molecular structures and can be obtained at high purities without variation between batches.27–39 By rational optimization of electron-donating polymers and NFAs, a variety of high-performance non-fullerene PSCs have been developed with PCEs higher than 12%.32,40
Typically, small molecule acceptors have acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type molecular structures. For instance, recently developed and extensively used high-performance NFAs (such as ITIC and its derivatives) contain an electron-rich indacenodithiophene (IDT)41–43 or indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT)27,44–46 core and are capped with strong electron-withdrawing groups (such as phenyl-fused indanone, INCN). These NFAs typically exhibit strong absorption from 600 to 800 nm. Thus, if incorporated into PSCs, these NFAs hinder the effective harvesting of photons because of the significant overlap between their absorption spectra and those of narrow-bandgap electron-donating polymers. To achieve complementary absorption in the photoactive layer, chemical modification of the core, side chains, and end-capping groups of the acceptors has been attempted to enhance the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect.47–56 A series of acceptors with absorption bands broadened by introducing electron-deficient moieties have been reported and shown to enhance the harvesting of solar energy when incorporated into PSCs.50–53 Overall, these reports suggest that enhancing the electron-withdrawing properties of the terminal groups could extend the absorption spectra of small-molecule acceptors. Thus, it is necessary to develop novel strong electron-withdrawing groups to produce new NFAs with extended absorption profiles. Although the effects of introducing electron-accepting moieties into end-groups such as INCN have been extensively studied, less attention has been devoted to investigating the effect of terminal groups on the optical bandgap of chromophores.
Considering that increasing the accepting strength of the end-groups can also enhance the ICT effect, resulting in red-shifted absorption spectra,57 in this study, we designed and synthesized two novel NFAs, IDT-N and IDT-T-N, which incorporate the electron-withdrawing moiety 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-cyclopenta[b]naphthalen-1-ylidene)malononitrile (N) as the end-group and IDT as the electron-donating core unit. The electron-deficient N group exhibits an expanded plane compared to the phenyl-based indanone (INCN) and thus may enhance the intramolecular push–pull effect between the central IDT unit and the terminal acceptor unit. This may result in a reduced bandgap, thereby enhancing the light harvesting capability of PSCs and increasing the short-circuit current density (JSC). IDT-T-N has a similar structure to IDT-N, with the addition of 3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene (T) linkers between IDT and the electron-deficient N group. Both acceptors are typical low-bandgap acceptors and exhibit strong and broad absorption in the visible region and an optical bandgap of about 1.5 eV. IDT-N and IDT-T-N exhibit red-shifted absorption spectra and lower energy levels than those of IDT-IC48 and IEIC,41 respectively, which can be attributed to the enhanced electron-withdrawing properties of the naphthyl-fused indanone end-groups. PSCs fabricated using either PTB7-Th or PBDB-T as the electron-donating polymer and IDT-N or IDT-T-N as the acceptor exhibited impressive PCEs of up to 9.0%. These results are attributable to the enhanced absorption of the novel NFAs and the complementary absorption profiles of the materials in the BHJ layer.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Material synthesis and characterization
As shown in Scheme 2, IDT-N and IDT-T-N were synthesized via multistep reactions using 2,3-naphthalenedicarboxylic anhydride as the starting material. First, 1H-cyclopenta[b]naphthalene-1,3(2H)-dione (2) was prepared in a 50% yield using a previously reported method.58 The electron-withdrawing moiety 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-cyclopenta[b]naphthalen-1-ylidene)malononitrile (N) was then synthesized (yield of 50%) by combining 2 with malononitrile in absolute ethanol at room temperature, with anhydrous sodium acetate as a catalyst. The IDT-T-CHO intermediate was obtained through a Stille coupling reaction using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst according to a previously reported procedure.41 Finally, IDT-N and IDT-T-N were obtained via Knoevenagel condensation reactions of the intermediate compounds (IDT-CHO and IDT-T-CHO) and the electron-withdrawing moiety (N) in 75% and 84% yields, respectively. The target NFAs were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Both NFAs exhibited good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform and o-dichlorobenzene. The thermal characteristics of the NFAs were evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S1, ESI†). IDT-N and IDT-T-N exhibited good thermal stability, with decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) of 381 °C and 344 °C, respectively.
2.2. Theoretical calculations
To reveal the relationships between the geometric and electronic properties of IDT-N and IDT-T-N, their optimal ground state geometries were determined by density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. These calculations were conducted using Gaussian 09 software. As shown in Fig. 1, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are delocalized over the backbone, which correlates with the highly coplanar backbones of IDT-N and IDT-T-N. The torsion angles of the optimized geometries of IDT-N and IDT-T-N were determined to be 0.99° and 19.85°, respectively. This indicates that IDT-N has a highly planar structure that may facilitate π-electron delocalization and enhance charge mobility. It is also worth noting that the larger torsion angle of IDT-T-N may hinder π-electron delocalization and decrease charge mobility.

2.3. Optical and electrochemical properties
The normalized ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of IDT-N and IDT-T-N in chloroform solution and as thin films are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The maximum absorption peaks (λmax) of IDT-N and IDT-T-N in chloroform are located at 687 and 734 nm, respectively. The λmax peaks of IDT-N and IDT-T-N films are located at 727 and 755 nm, respectively. IDT-T-N exhibits a red-shifted λmax and a smaller optical bandgap, compared with IDT-N, because of the increased conjugation length of the core. In chloroform solution, the IDT-N spectrum exhibits a shoulder absorption at 632 nm; the spectrum of IDT-T-N only has a single main absorption peak, which suggests that IDT-N has a more planar structure than IDT-T-N. This finding is consistent with the simulated molecular structure estimated by DFT.

In addition, the absorption spectra of IDT-N and IDT-T-N as thin films are slightly red-shifted compared to the corresponding solution spectra, which can be attributed to the strong π–π intermolecular interactions in thin films. The absorption peaks of IDT-N are red-shifted by 41 nm in solution and 46 nm in film relative to those of IDT-IC48 (in which IC is an electron-withdrawing capping unit); this corresponds to the slightly higher absorption coefficient of IDT-N (1.53 × 105 M−1 cm−1) relative to that of IDT-IC (1.40 × 105 M−1 cm−1). Moreover, the absorption peaks of IDT-T-N are red-shifted (by 62 nm in solution and 33 nm in film) relative to those of IEIC, and these species have similar absorption coefficients (1.03 × 105 M−1 cm−1 and 1.1 × 105 M−1 cm−1). It is also worth noting that, in film state, the absorption coefficient of IDT-N (1.49 × 105 cm−1) is much higher than that of IDT-IC (1.01 × 105 cm−1), while the absorption coefficient of IDT-T-N (0.76 × 105 cm−1) is comparable to that of IEIC (0.62 × 105 cm−1) (Fig. S4 and Table S2, ESI†). This trend is consistent with that observed for the chloroform solution. The difference in the absorption coefficients of the two systems might have originated from the molecular geometry. As the torsion angles of the central IDT unit with the end-group is relatively small for IDT-N (0.99°) and much larger for IDT-T-N (19.85°), it seems reasonable that the end-groups will have more pronounced intra-molecular charge transfer effects for IDT-N/IDT-IC. The red-shifted absorption and high absorption coefficients of IDT-N and IDT-T-N are favorable for harvesting solar photons, therefore resulting in high current densities in PSCs. The optical bandgaps of IDT-N and IDT-T-N are 1.66 and 1.52 eV, respectively, which were calculated according to the absorption edges of the thin films (784 and 854 nm, respectively).
The frontier molecular orbital energy levels of IDT-N and IDT-T-N were estimated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the reference (Fig. 2c). The HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated relative to the onsets of the oxidation and reduction potentials according to the following equations: HOMO = −e[Eox − E(Fc/Fc+) + 4.8] (eV) and LUMO = −e[Ered − E(Fc/Fc+) + 4.8] (eV), where Eox and Ered are the onsets of oxidation and reduction, respectively. The potential of the Fc/Fc+ redox couple was surveyed at 0.2 V relative to an Ag/Ag+ reference electrode. The CV parameters are summarized in Table 1. The HOMO/LUMO levels of IDT-N and IDT-T-N are −5.74/−4.08 and −5.58/−4.06 eV, respectively, which correspond to electrochemical bandgaps (Ecvg) of 1.66 and 1.52 eV. IDT-T-N has an elevated LUMO level compared to IDT-N because of its greater conjugation length. This will result in a higher VOC when paired with suitable donor materials. The LUMO gaps between PBDB-T and IDT-N or IDT-T-N are 0.55 and 0.53 eV, respectively, which ensure efficient exciton dissociation. However, because of the expanded plane of the electron-withdrawing moiety (N), the LUMO levels of IDT-N and IDT-T-N are lower than those of IDT-IC and IEIC, which may result in lower VOC values. The energy levels of the PSCs are shown in Fig. 2d; the work functions of the ITO and Ag electrodes and the HOMO and LUMO levels of PBDB-T, PTB7-Th, and the interlayer material (PNDIT-F3N-Br) were obtained from previous reports.48,59–61
2.4. Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of IDT-N and IDT-T-N, PSCs were fabricated in a conventional device configuration: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PNDIT-F3N-Br/Ag, in which PNDIT-F3N-Br functioned as the cathode interlayer to facilitate electron extraction from the active layer (Scheme 1). The active layer was composed of either a narrow bandgap polymer (PTB7-Th) or a wide bandgap polymer (PBDB-T), which acted as the electron donor material; either IDT-N or IDT-T-N was used as the electron-accepting material. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the studied devices are shown in Fig. 3a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The optimization of the PSCs, including the donor:acceptor ratios and the effects of solvent additives, is summarized in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI†).

The as-cast device based on PTB7-Th:IDT-N exhibited a PCE of 5.5%, which is higher than that of previously reported devices based on PTB7-Th:IDT-IC (3.2%). The enhanced PCE correlates with the increased JSC (from 9.53 to 13.02 mA cm−2), which was attributed to the red-shifted and better-matched absorption of IDT-N. The devices based on PTB7-Th:IDT-T-N exhibited a PCE of 6.6%, which is higher than that of reported devices based on PTB7-Th:IEIC (6.3%).41 Devices based on PBDB-T exhibited better performances than the PTB7-Th-based PSCs, which can be attributed to the increased VOC (as a result of the lower HOMO level of PBDB-T) and JSC (because of better matched absorption spectra; Fig. S2, ESI†). The PSCs based on PBDB-T:IDT-N and PBDB-T:IDT-T-N cast without CN exhibited PCEs of 6.9% and 5.4%, respectively. Processing with 0.25% CN improved the PCE of the PBDB-T:IDT-N device from 6.9% to 9.0%; and the PCE of the PBDB-T:IDT-T-N device increased from 5.4% to 7.4% when processed with 2% CN. Hence, the addition of CN significantly enhanced the photovoltaic performance by virtue of the enhanced JSC and FF.
For comparison, we also fabricated devices based on IDT-IC or IEIC as the acceptor and PBDB-T as the donor, with relevant photovoltaic parameters shown in Table S5 (ESI,† device architecture: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PNDIT-F3N-Br/Ag). It is noted that the PCEs of devices based on PBDB-T:IDT-IC with/without CN additives are 5.7%/6.8%, and the PCEs of devices based on PBDB-T:IEIC with/without CN additives are 3.9%/6.9%, respectively. The higher PCEs of devices based on IDT-N and IDT-T-N are mainly due to the higher JSC and FF, which can be attributed to the extended conjugation of their end-groups. We note that despite the fact that the two acceptors, IDT-N and IDT-T-N, exhibited similar LUMO energy levels to those estimated by CV measurements, the resulting device based on IDT-T-N exhibited obviously higher VOC than those of the device based on IDT-N. However, as VOC correlates with a range of factors such as charge transfer state, film morphology, tail of the density of state, and so forth, at the current stage it is not clear which is the dominant factor that determines the loss of VOC. Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out that the device based on PBDB-T:IDT-T-N exhibits a relatively small energy loss (Eloss = Eg − eVOC) of 0.51 eV, which is slightly larger than those observed for inorganic solar cells (0.35–0.50 eV)62 whilst being smaller than the typical values of 0.6–1.0 eV for PSCs.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices based on PBDB-T:IDT-N or PBDB-T:IDT-T-N with or without CN are shown in Fig. 3b. The EQE responses are consistent with the measured JSC values of the devices. The integrated photocurrents were 14.52 and 15.17 mA cm−2 for the PBDB-T:IDT-N system without and with the CN additive, respectively, which are very close to the values of 14.89 and 15.88 mA cm−2 obtained from the J–V characterization, respectively (Table 2). Similarly, the integrated photocurrents were 12.81 and 13.15 mA cm−2 for the PBDB-T:IDT-T-N system without and with the CN additive, respectively, which are also close to the values of 12.97 and 14.03 mA cm−2 obtained from the J–V characterization respectively (Table 2). The PBDB-T:IDT-N systems exhibited a broad photoresponse from 300 to 780 nm with a maximum value of about 69% at 700 nm. The PBDB-T:IDT-T-N systems had a broader response, from 300 to 850 nm, with a maximum value of about 53% at 730 nm. These results are in good agreement with the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the acceptors and the PBDB-T donor (Fig. S2, ESI†).
Space-charge limited current (SCLC) methods were used to evaluate the charge carrier mobilities of the pristine IDT-N and IDT-T-N films and the PBDB-T:IDT-N and PBDB-T:IDT-T-N blend films with and without CN. The electron-only and hole-only mobilities were measured using devices with ITO/Al/BHJ film/Ca/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ film/MoO3/Ag architectures, respectively. The current–voltage (J1/2–V) curves of these devices are shown in Fig. 4 and S5 (ESI†). The electron mobilities of the IDT-N and IDT-T-N films were calculated to be 1.09 × 10−4 and 1.53 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table 3), respectively. The addition of CN increased the electron and hole mobilities of both blend films, which correlates with the increased JSC values of these devices. Furthermore, the μh/μe ratios of the blend films processed with CN (1.59 and 2.36 for PBDB-T:IDT-N and PBDB-T:IDT-T-N, respectively) were found to be lower than those of the devices processed without CN (2.19 and 2.85, respectively). The more balanced hole/electron ratios suppressed bimolecular recombination and increased the FF values of the CN-processed films, which is consistent with the results of previous experiments. These findings indicated that the addition of CN is an efficient way to improve the morphologies, charge mobilities, and FF values of blend films.

2.5. Charge transfer and recombination
Photoluminescence (PL) measurements of the BHJ films were performed to monitor charge transfer between the donor and acceptor materials. The fluorescence spectra of pure IDT-N, IDT-T-N, and PBDB-T and pristine and optimized PBDB-T:IDT-N and PBDB-T:IDT-T-N blend films are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. The blend films processed with chloronaphthalene (CN) as a solvent additive exhibited more effective PL quenching than the pristine films. This suggests that more effective photoinduced charge transfer occurred between PBDB-T and the acceptors (IDT-N and IDT-T-N), in the blend films processed with CN, and nearly all of the excitons were dissociated. This is beneficial for achieving a higher JSC in PSCs fabricated from these films.

To understand the charge recombination mechanism of the studied devices, we investigated the characteristics of JSC and VOC as a function of light intensity (Plight), which was varied from 5 to 100 mW cm−2. The relevant characteristics are plotted in Fig. 6. The power law dependence of JSC on illumination intensity can be expressed as JSC ∝ (Plight)S. Here S is the exponential factor. It is noted that the JSC of the fabricated devices increased linearly with Plight (Fig. 6a and b). The extracted S value increased slightly from 0.975 (without CN) to 0.987 (with CN) for the device based on IDT-N (Fig. 6a), and the S value also increased slightly from 0.943 (without CN) to 0.969 (with CN) for the device based on IDT-T-N (Fig. 6b). These results demonstrate that the bimolecular recombination can be suppressed in devices processed with CN, which can lead to an improved FF.
 Fig. 6  (a and b) JSC as a function of light intensity and (c and d) VOC as a function of light intensity for the devices based on PBDB-T:IDT-N or PBDB-T:IDT-T-N with or without CN additives, respectively. 
Moreover, we plotted the VOC as a function of Plight. The slope of VOCversus the natural logarithm of Plight gives the value of kBT/q, where kB, T, and q represent the Boltzmann constant, temperature (K), and elementary charge, respectively. It is noted that the extracted slope of the IDT-N-based device decreased slightly from 1.15 kBT/q (without CN) to 1.12 kBT/q (with CN) (Fig. 6c), and the extracted slope of the IDT-T-N-based device also decreased slightly from 1.12 kBT/q (without CN) to 1.04 kBT/q (with CN) (Fig. 6d). Typically, when additional mechanisms such as trap-assisted recombination are involved, a stronger dependence of VOC on Plight with a slope greater than kBT/q can be observed. The obtained lower slope demonstrates the reduced trap density and suppressed trap-assisted recombination in the devices processed with the CN additive.
2.6. Film morphology
The film morphology was investigated by using atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). With regard to the PBDB-T:IDT-N and PBDB-T:IDT-T-N films (Fig. S6, ESI†), the blend films processed with the CN solvent additive exhibited fibrous features with slightly larger root-mean-square (RMS) values (Fig. 7a and b). Additionally, from the TEM images one can note more obvious phase separation of the CN-processed film than those processed without the additive (Fig. S7, ESI†). GIWAXS was used to investigate the molecular ordering in the neat films as well as in the blends. One can obviously note that both the neat films of IDT-N and IDT-T-N exhibited strong (010) diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and the corresponding (100) peaks in the in-plane (IP) direction (Fig S8a, b and g, ESI†), which indicates the formation of the predominant “face-on” orientation of these acceptors. For the blends, the (010) reflection peaks are located at 1.80 Å−1 in the OOP direction and the corresponding (100) peaks are at 0.31 Å−1 in the IP direction, demonstrating the preferential “face-on” orientation, which is favorable for vertical charge transportation. It is also worth noting that the intensity of the (100) peaks at 0.31 Å−1 in the OOP direction is stronger for blends processed with CN additives, which indicates an improved alkyl side chain stacking. This observation is consistent with the enhanced photovoltaic performance of devices processed with CN additives compared with those processed without CN.

3. Conclusion
Two novel NFAs (IDT-N and IDT-T-N) based on an IDT core end-capped with the electron-withdrawing moiety 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-cyclopenta[b]naphthalen-1-ylidene)malononitrile (N) were designed and synthesized. The terminal N groups enhanced the electron acceptance of the NFAs, relative to those terminated with phenyl-fused indanone moieties. Moreover, IDT-N and IDT-T-N exhibited red-shifted absorption, deeper LUMO levels, and smaller bandgaps than IDT-IC and IEIC, respectively. The broadened and red-shifted optical absorption of the novel NFAs resulted in improved JSC values for the corresponding PSCs. However, because of their decreased LUMO energy levels, the VOC values of the PSCs were relatively low. The devices based on PBDB-T:IDT-N exhibited the highest measured PCE (9.0%). The devices based on PBDB-T:IDT-T-N exhibited a moderate PCE of 7.4%. When the narrow bandgap copolymer PTB7-Th was used as the electron-donating material, the resulting IDT-N- and IDT-T-N-based PSCs exhibited higher performances than those based on either IDT-IC or IEIC. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that novel small molecule acceptors are promising candidates as replacements for fullerene derivatives in PSCs and that the modification of end-group units is a promising strategy to develop more efficient non-fullerene acceptors.

4.1. General information
All reactions were carried out under an argon atmosphere. All solvents and reagents were commercially available and used directly without further purification unless otherwise specified. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene (PhMe) were dried with sodium/benzophenone and freshly distilled before use.
NMR spectra were recorded with a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer for 1H NMR and at 125 MHz for 13C NMR with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal reference. MALDI-TOF-MS spectra were measured on a Bruker BIFLEX III mass spectrometer. UV-Vis spectra were obtained by using an HP 8453 spectrophotometer. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were conducted on a NETZSCH TG 209 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 at a nitrogen flow rate of 20 mL min−1. The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were carried out on a CHI600D electrochemical workstation equipped with an ITO working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, a Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode and a 0.1 mol L−1 acetonitrile solution of tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) as the supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+) was used to calibrate the potential of the Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out on a NanoMan VS microscope in the tapping mode. TEM images were obtained from a JEM-2100F instrument. The geometry of the acceptors was optimized by using the Density Functional Theory (DFT) method at a B3LYP/6-31G(d) level to optimize the ground state geometries. All the calculations of the acceptor molecules were performed using the Gaussian 09 package;40 all the straight-chain substituents were replaced with methyl groups and the branched side-chain substituents were replaced with isopropyl groups for calculations.

4.3. Fabrication and characterization of solar cells
All the solar cell devices were fabricated with a conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PNDIT-F3N-Br/Ag. Firstly, the ITO glass substrates were pre-cleaned sequentially with detergent, ethanol, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol under sonication and dried in an oven at 70 °C for 10 h before use. Following treatment with oxygen plasma for 4 min, the PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the ITO glass at 3000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 10 min in air. Subsequently, the substrates were transferred into a N2-protected glovebox for spin-coating the active layer. The donor polymer (PTB7-Th or PBDB-T) and the small molecule acceptor (IDT-N or IDT-T-N) were dissolved in CHCl3 solution (with varied blend ratios, the total concentration of the donor polymer and the acceptor is 10 mg mL−1). The mixed solution was spin-coated atop the PEDOT:PSS layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s to form the active layer with a film thickness of approximately 100 nm. Then, the active layers were treated by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. Finally, the interface layer (5 nm) of PNDIT-F3N-Br in methanol (0.5 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the blended films, and then the top silver electrode (100 nm) was deposited onto the interlayer PNDIT-F3N-Br by thermal evaporation though a shadow mask in a vacuum chamber with a base pressure of 1 × 10−6 mbar. The active layer area of the device was 0.04 cm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination from an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Taiwan, Enlitech SS-F5) at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, which was tested using a calibrated silicon solar cell (certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory) before the test. The PL spectra and EQE spectra were acquired on an FLS920 spectrofluorimeter (Edinburgh Instruments) and a commercial EQE measurement system (Taiwan, Enlitech, QE-R), respectively.
4.4. SCLC measurements
The hole-only and electron-only mobilities of PBDB-T: acceptor blend films and the acceptor neat films were determined from space-charge-limited current (SCLC) devices. The devices were fabricated with the structures of ITO/Al/ blend films (or neat film)/Ca/Al for electron-only mobility and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend films (neat film)/MoO3/Ag for hole-only mobility, respectively. The mobilities were determined by fitting the dark J–V current to the model of a single carrier SCLC, and were calculated on the basis of the following equation:  where J is the current, ε0 and εr are the permittivity of free space and relative permittivity of the material, respectively, and μh, V and d are the zero-field mobility, the effective voltage, and the thickness of the organic layer, respectively. The effective voltage can be obtained from the equation V = Vappl − Vbi − Vs, where Vapp, Vbi and Vs are the applied voltage, the offset voltage and the voltage drop, respectively (Vbi = 0 and Vs = 10 × I, where the value 10 is the resistance of MnO3 and I is the current of the devices in this work). The electron- and hole-mobility can be calculated from the slope of the J1/2–V curves.
