The dihydropyrroloindoledione unit was alternately copolymerized with phenyl, thiophene and bithiophene comonomers, and the resultant polymers exhibit broad absorption, low-bandgaps and deep energy levels, with charge carrier mobilities approaching 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1. Solar cells processed in a printing friendly solvent (m-xylene) exhibited >2% PCE with a high fill-factor of 0.62 and Voc of 0.75 V.
Introduction
The synthesis of dihydropyrroloindoledione (DPID)-based π-conjugated low-bandgap copolymers was recently reported.1 Designed for organic electronic applications, the dihydropyrroloindoledione (DPID) unit is structurally related to the much studied chromophores2 of the diketopyrrolopyrrole3 (DPP) and benzodipyrrolidone4 (BP) colorants, containing the bis-lactam molecular architecture. However, the inclusion of vinyl linkages directly flanking DPID acceptor chromophore units increases their spacing along a copolymer backbone potentially reducing steric hindrance between polymer chains. Such methodology has been shown to result in closer packing, reducing inter-lamellar and π-stacking distances.5 Likewise, the electron-deficient inner-core of DPID due to its bis-lactam functionality, flanked by electronically coupled electron rich units (thiophene or thienothiophene) renders these excellent donor–acceptor hybridized molecular orbital type polymers, with low bandgaps. The highly dipolar nature of the backbone, and its orthogonal orientation, encourages intermolecular interactions, and with the lack of steric twisting, a planar conformation is expected. Furthermore, the central six-membered ring in DPID not only extends the conjugation and delocalization of electrons as for BP but is also aromatic in character which may further enhance π–π stacking, unlike the quinoidal nature of DPP. This can lead to a more distributed LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) and HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital), enhancing ambipolar charge transport6 and the potential for high performing organic solar cells.7 In addition, such polymers frequently exhibit the required solubility and processability to be printed in device fabrication.
Here we report on the performance of four dihydropyrroloindoledione (DPID)-based polymers (Chart 1) in organic electronic devices. A thiophene-flanked dihydropyrroloindoledione (DPIDT) was copolymerized with phenyl, thiophene and bithiophene repeat units and a thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-flanked DPID also copolymerized with thiophene. The synthesis, thermal, optical and electronic properties and molecular models of the polymers are presented. Polymer thin films are analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Organic field effect transistors (OFET) and organic photovoltaic cells (OPV) were fabricated and their device characteristics are reported. Analysis of the OPV device morphology was probed by atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The polymers DPIDT-P and DPIDT-T were prepared as described previously1 and DPIDT-2T by slight modification of the polymerization procedure therein (see Scheme 1) using the previously prepared monomer M1 with 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene. The analogous thienothiophene-flanked dihydropyrroloindoledione monomer M2 was also prepared by slight modification of the same literature procedure (see ESI Scheme S1†). The key steps of the procedure are a two-directional Pummerer-type8 cyclisation as previously developed by Procter et al.9 and subsequent samarium iodide10,11 reduction to furnish the intermediate DPID tricycle, followed by a two-directional Knoevenagel condensation with 5-bromo-2-thieno[3,2-b]thiophenecarboxaldehyde. Separation by column chromatography affords the monomers M1 and M2 both as waxy black solids almost exclusively in their expected cis (Z) configurations.12 The Z isomers are desired as these may facilitate planarising sulfur–oxygen interactions believed to result from 3-centre-4-electron interactions between lone pairs of electrons on the oxygen atoms and σ*S–C orbitals leading to weak unsymmetrical hypervalent bonds.13
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of the polymer DPIDT-2T. 
While the phenyl copolymer DPIDT-P was synthesized under standard Suzuki coupling conditions in a toluene/water solvent system, the thiophene-based copolymers DPIDT-T, DPIDT-2T and DPIDTT-T (see ESI Scheme S1†) were synthesized under standard microwave Stille coupling conditions in chlorobenzene. The four polymers were purified by precipitation from methanol followed by Soxhlet extraction using acetone, hexane and finally chloroform and then, in the case of DPIDTT-T, chlorobenzene. The latter fraction(s) (chloroform and chlorobenzene) were then heated and vigorously stirred with aqueous sodium diethyldithiocarbamate to remove residual catalytic metal impurities. Lower molecular-weight oligomers were readily removed in the acetone and hexane fractions, giving satisfactory number-average molecular weights and moderate polydispersity indexes (PDIs) for the DPIDT-P and DPIDT-T copolymers, whereas the incorporation of the larger aromatic thienothiophene and bithiophene rendered the polymer only sparingly soluble, and suppressed the growth of high molecular weight polymer chains (Table 1). The DPIDTT-T polymer in fact proved too insoluble for further study and we were not able to obtain any characterization data beyond optical (UV-Vis) properties of the chloroform fraction.

Thermal properties
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out and the DPIDT polymers all exhibit a decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) above 395 °C (see Fig. S2 ESI†). However, no transitions were observed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) between −30 °C and 350 °C for any of the polymers, in common with the structurally related phenyl-flanked benzodipyrrolidone2 (BPP) (see ESI Fig. S3†).
Optical properties
UV-Vis absorption spectra of the DPID polymers are shown in Fig. 1 and summarized in Table 1. Dilute solutions are in chlorobenzene and thin films spin-coated from ∼5 mg mL−1 chlorobenzene solutions on glass substrates. The polymers all display absorption maxima near 650 nm in thin films, the large red-shift from the monomer absorption being attributable to extended conjugation in the polymer. However, there is only a negligible red-shift in absorption on going from polymer solutions to thin films, possibly due to aggregation in solution. The low optical bandgaps (∼1.6 eV), coupled with a broad absorption profile suggest that these thiophene-flanked dihydropyrroloindoledione polymers should be effective low-bandgap donor polymers in organic heterojunction solar cells.

Energy levels
Ionisation potentials were evaluated by Photo Electron Spectroscopy in Air (PESA) and are also summarized in Table 1. Samples were prepared by spin-coating polymer thin films on glass substrates from 5 mg mL−1 solutions in chlorobenzene. The DPIDT polymers all exhibited HOMO energy levels below −5 eV and LUMO energy levels above −4 eV; LUMO levels are found by adding the optical bandgap (Eoptg) to the PESA determined HOMO level of the same thin films. These energy level values are comparable to those of the phenyl-flanked benzodipyrrolidone (BPP)-based polymers,3 exhibiting larger electron affinities than typical diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based polymers. These deep HOMO energy levels (below −5 eV) could facilitate enhanced open-circuit voltage (Voc) in devices and may indicate good air stability.
The larger bandgap of DPIDT-P (∼1.7 eV) relative to the other three DPID-based polymers (<1.6 eV) is believed to result from a larger torsional angle between the DPID core-flanking thiophenes and the comonomer,1 where the phenyl moiety introduces greater steric hindrance, reducing planarity and reducing π orbital overlap between the conjugated units in the polymer backbone.14
Optimized structures of the four DPID-based polymers are shown in the ESI (Fig. S3†) (modeled at the B3LYP/6-31 G* level, for N-methyl substituted polymers, modeled as tetramers only shown in part). The red-shifted absorption and low optical bandgap (∼1.54 eV) of DPIDTT-T and reasonably low HOMO energy level (as implied by density functional theory [DFT] calculations) could lead to a high Voc [open-circuit voltage] on optimization of the solubilizing alkyl side chains. For all four DPID-based polymers the HOMO and LUMO energy distributions are extensively delocalized along the polymer chain, as opposed to being localized on the donor and acceptor parts, respectively. This large delocalization could facilitate enhanced ambipolar transport.
Morphology
Thin films of the DPIDT-based polymers were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. 2). Thin films were drop-cast from polymer solution (40 mg mL−1 hot chlorobenzene) onto Si substrates and allowed to dry in air for 24 h. The films were all featureless with the exception of DPIDT-2T which, as cast, exhibited an out-of-plane primary reflection peak at 2θ = ∼4.8°, characteristic of lamellar-type crystallinity in π stacked conjugated polymers. The low angle diffraction peak is associable with the interlayer d-spacing distance, calculated to be ∼20 Å. The broad reflection at 2θ = ∼24°, may be further indicative of extended π–π stacking interactions (d-spacing distance calculated to be ∼3.6 Å) which could be beneficial for charge transport. Upon annealing, the out-of-plane reflection at low angles disappears completely, which may be a result of a change in orientation from out-of-plane to in-plane, as has been occasionally observed for DPP-based polymers.15DPIDT-T and DPIDT-P do not show clear out of plane reflections.

Charge carrier transport
Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) were prepared with the DPIDT-based polymers. Top gate/bottom contact devices were fabricated by spin-coating from polymer solution (5 mg mL−1 in hot chlorobenzene). The devices were then dried at 120 °C for 10 min and annealed at 180 °C under an inert nitrogen atmosphere. Both the DPIDT and DPIDT-2T polymers displayed ambipolar behavior, with hole and electron mobilities of 0.05 and 0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the DPIDT-T and 0.09 and 0.04 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the DPIDT-2T, respectively. The DPIDT-P only exhibited hole transport with mobility of 0.08 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table 2). The output and transfer curves of annealed DPIDT-2T are depicted in Fig. 3.

Photovoltaic cells
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated with the DPIDT-T and DPIDT-2T polymers and the results are summarized in Table 3. Cells were prepared by spin-coating from a 1:2 polymer–acceptor mixture in a 12 mg mL−1 dichlorobenzene solution onto an ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate followed by evaporation of Ca/Al as a backcontact. DPIDT-T gave only a very limited power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.1% with phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the fullerene acceptor. However, adding chloronaphthalene (CN) increased this to 1.6%. Such processing additives are believed to influence the polymer and fullerene acceptor, giving a smoother and more homogeneous bulk morphology.16 Changing to DPIDT-2T with a slightly higher LUMO of −3.7 eV (cf. −3.8 eV for DPIDT-T) yielded a further increase to 1.9% PCE. Whilst changing the acceptor from PC71BM to indene-C(60) bisadduct (ICBA) greatly reduced efficiency, the use of PC61BM afforded 1.9% PCE. The low performance of the cells is attributed to the LUMO level of the fullerene derivatives being too close to that of the DPID-based donor polymers to give a suitable energy level offset enabling effective charge separation.17

On changing to a chlorine-free deposition solvent, namely m-xylene, DPIDT-2T generated a short-circuit current (Jsc) of ∼5.3 mA cm−2, a moderate open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.75 V and reasonable fill-factor (FF) of 0.62 yielding over 2% PCE (Fig. 4). The use of non-chlorinated solvents in OPV device fabrication is of interest as an area of ‘green chemistry’ due to the negative environmental impacts of chlorinated solvents.18 For example in the industrial roll-to-roll printing of organic solar cells less toxic solvents are desired due to the high volumes of ink to be used. Typically moving away from chlorinated solvents results in a significant drop in performance making the consistent PCE of DPIDT-2T from dichlorobenzene to m-xylene interesting.19
 Fig. 4  Photovoltaic device performance: current–voltage curves of dihydropyrroloindoledione-based polymer DPIDT-2T (polymer/PC61BM blend with CN additive; spin-coated from m-xylene solution). 
The origins of the limited solar cell efficiency of the DPIDT-T and DPIDT-2T polymers was further probed by measuring the external quantum efficiency (EQE) (Fig. 5) of the comparable photovoltaic devices (as cast polymer/PC71BM blends with CN additive; spin-coated from DCB solution). The relatively low20 EQE values, ∼12% for DPIDT-T and ∼25% for DPIDT-2T, imply limited charge separation in the blends from polymer to fullerene acceptor, believed, as discussed, to be due to the small offset in LUMO energy levels. The photovoltaic device thin films were additionally analyzed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) using the same devices that the EQE measurements were performed on (Fig. 6). The beneficial effects of adding chloronaphthalene (CN) are clear from the improvement in film homogeneity for DPIDT-T, where the large-scale phase separation is removed, which may explain the rise in PCE (from 1.1 to 1.6%). However, all the films remain quite rough, showing a relatively high degree of phase separation on the 1 μm scale which may also contribute to the inhibited charge separation from donor polymer to acceptor.

Conclusions
Thiophene-flanked dihydropyrroloindoledione-based copolymers exhibit broad, long wavelength absorption, low-bandgaps and HOMO energy levels below −5 eV. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are extensively delocalized along the conjugated polymer chain, which for planar DPID-2T facilitates ambipolar charge transport with carrier mobilities approaching 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 in field effect transistors. Bulk heterojunction solar cells exhibited a high Voc of 0.75 V and fill-factor of 0.62, yielding ∼2% PCE. The limited efficiencies may result from inhibited charge separation due to a low LUMO energy level offset with PCBM, or non-optimal phase separation in the blend microstructure. Furthermore, the comparable efficiencies achieved with printing friendly solvent m-xylene instead of dichlorobenzene are also of interest.
