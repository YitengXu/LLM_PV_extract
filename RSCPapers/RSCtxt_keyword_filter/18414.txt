    , Accepted 27th August 2022First published on 14th September 2022AbstractThree biphenyl co-sensitizers (4OBA, 8OBA and 12OBA) with different terminal oxyalkyl chains were synthesized and co-sensitized respectively with the main dye (NP-1) in co-sensitized solar cells (co-DSSCs). The effects of the terminal oxyalkyl chains on the photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the co-DSSCs were systematically investigated. The optimal molecular matching relationship between the co-sensitizers and the main dye was obtained through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Consequently, 4OBA has the most appropriate three-dimensional (3D) molecular structure, which could not only fill the gap between the large-size dyes but also plays a partial shielding role, inhibiting dye aggregation and electron recombination, therefore yielding the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) for the co-DSSCs with NP-1@4OBA. This study suggests that adjusting the terminal oxyalkyl chains of the co-sensitizers can be used to enhance the intramolecular charge transfer efficiency and inhibit electron recombination, ultimately improving the photovoltaic performances of the co-DSSCs.
1. Introduction
To effectively alleviate increasing energy demands and serious environmental problems, developing clean and renewable energy resources is urgently required.1 Solar energy, as the most inexhaustible energy resource, is believed to be an excellent candidate.2 Among various photovoltaic technologies (i.e., dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), organic solar cells (OSC), perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and quantum dot solar cells (QDSC)), DSSCs have become an effective alternative to dominant silicon-based solar cells due to the flexibility in molecular design, ease of fabrication and low production costs.3–5 Typical DSSCs are generally composed of three components, namely dye-sensitized mesoporous metal oxides (e.g., TiO2, ZnO or SnO2) as the working electrode, precious metal platinum as the counter electrode and redox electrolyte.6,7 Here, sensitizers, including dyes and co-sensitizers, play vital roles in harvesting sunlight and injecting photoexcited electrons into the conduction band (CB) of metal oxides. The molecular structure of sensitizers usually affects the PCE of DSSCs8,9 because of the effect of molecular configuration on intermolecular aggregation and charge recombination.10–12
In general, introducing co-sensitizers is an effective approach to address issues such as dye aggregation and charge recombination, which is known as the co-sensitization technology of DSSCs.13–18 However, the field of co-sensitization is still far from mature, and some limitations arising from the use of multiple dyes on metal oxide semiconductor layers remain to be addressed (e.g., unfavorable dye⋯dye π–π interactions lead to electron quenching, etc.). At present, these can be delayed in a number of ways, most typically by adding the anti-aggregation agents chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) or deoxycholic acid (DCA).19–24 They act as physical spacers between the functional dye molecules, thereby reducing the tendency of dye aggregation.21 But, adding different proportions of anti-aggregation agents usually affects the dye loading,25,26 which may lead to quenching of the photoexcited-state dyes.27,28 Therefore, based on the reported research observations, dyes containing a terminal oxyalkyl chain could significantly retard interfacial charge recombination and dye aggregation, and improve the electron injection efficiency.29–32 The effect of the terminal oxyalkyl chain length of co-sensitizers on co-sensitization should be systematically investigated (Scheme 1).14,33

Here, three co-sensitizers (4OBA, 8OBA and 12OBA), featuring biphenyl-4-carboxylic acids with different terminal oxyalkyl chains (see Fig. 1 for the molecular structures), were designed and synthesized to co-sensitize respectively with the triphenylamine-based dye (NP-1) for investigating the effect of the co-sensitization system on the photovoltaic performances of co-DSSCs. With the aid of the optimized 3D molecular structures by DFT calculations, the optimal molecule-matching co-sensitization system is obtained successfully. Consequently, this co-sensitization system considering a molecular match is expected to become one of the effective strategies to avoid dye aggregation and electron recombination, further improving the photovoltaic performance of devices.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Theoretical calculations
To gain insight into the electron distribution and molecular steric configuration, density functional theory (DFT) studies based on quantum mechanical calculations were conducted without imposing any constraints using the Gaussian 09 program package at the RB3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level.34–36 The spatial distribution of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of nOBA (n = 4, 8 and 12) co-sensitizers is shown in Fig. 2. The HOMO and LUMO on biphenyl groups almost overlap, and these orbitals directly participate in the charge transport, optical behavior and interaction with nearby molecules,22 which facilitates the migration and injection of electrons.11

Dye sensitizers require that the frontier state HOMO and LUMO energy levels match the semiconductor band edges to ensure efficient charge transfer to the semiconductor substrate.37 The LUMO energy levels of the small-size co-sensitizers 4OBA (−1.632 eV), 8OBA (−1.628 eV), and 12OBA (−1.625 eV) are higher than that of the conduction band (−4.0 eV) of the semiconductor TiO2, indicating that the electrons in the excited state can be successfully injected into the conduction band of TiO2. Similarly, the HOMO levels of the co-sensitizers 4OBA (−6.012 eV), 8OBA (−6.005 eV), and 12OBA (−6.003 eV) are all lower than that of the I−/I3− redox electrolyte (−4.6 eV), indicating that the redox electrolyte has sufficient driving force for dye regeneration.24,38 Therefore, under photoexcitation conditions, the HOMO–LUMO excitation can efficiently transfer electrons from the donor moiety to the acceptor moiety and into the conduction band of TiO2, which is ideal for the required charge separation in DSSCs.
However, these small-size co-sensitizers suffer from a poor PCE due to the narrow absorption region, poor dye regeneration, high recombination rate, and dye aggregation. The aggregation of dyes is mostly caused by the accumulation of dye molecules. As shown in Fig. 2, with the expansion of the terminal oxyalkyl chains, the LUMO energy levels for 4OBA, 8OBA, and 12OBA gradually increase (−1.632 eV < −1.628 eV < −1.625 eV), while their HOMO energy levels also increase sequentially (−6.012 eV < −6.005 eV < −6.003 eV). It can be seen that their HOMO and LUMO energy levels can be adjusted by the terminal oxyalkyl chains. In addition, the HOMO and LUMO of the three co-sensitizers are mainly distributed on the planar benzene ring. The growth of the oxyalkyl chains does not affect the main distribution of HOMO and LUMO, so the extension of the terminal oxyalkyl chains may not affect the electrochemical performances.39
In order to reveal the influence of molecular structure sizes on the co-sensitization systems, the 3D molecular models obtained by DFT calculations are shown in Fig. 3(a), and the length (L), width (W) and height (H) values of the optimized molecular models are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). The 3D molecular lengths increase in the order of: 17.91 Å for 4OBA < 21.67 Å for NP-1 < 22.93 Å for 8OBA < 28.33 Å for 12OBA. It can be seen from Fig. 3(b) that there is a linear relationship between the number of carbons in the oxyalkyl chains and the length of the 3D molecular structures. Moreover, the 3D molecular length of NP-1 is between 4OBA and 8OBA, that is to say, the molecular length of 4OBA is smaller than that of NP-1, and the co-sensitizer 4OBA is likely to fill the gap between the main dyes (NP-1) in the co-sensitization systems.
 Fig. 3  (a) The 3D sizes, (b) 3D molecular lengths, and (c) 3D molecular models (including side views) obtained by DFT calculations for NP-1, 4OBA, 8OBA and 12OBA. 
In addition, the side-view 3D molecular models obtained by the DFT calculations in Fig. 3(c) are considered as important parameters. For similar co-sensitization systems, the co-sensitization effect could be roughly evaluated by checking the height/width (H/W) ratio. The closer the H/W value is to 1, the stronger the steric effect of the molecule.40 Comparing 12OBA (1.91), 8OBA (1.77) and 4OBA (1.66) in Table S1 (ESI†), it can be found that the H/W value of 4OBA is closest to 1, indicating that it possesses the largest molecular steric effect and prospectively forms the best matching relationship with NP-1 in the co-sensitization system.
2.2. Photophysical properties
The absorption spectrum and energy level characteristics of sensitizers are the key factors for the photovoltaic performances. In order to explore the effect of these co-sensitizers with different terminal oxyalkyl chains on the absorption characteristics in the cocktail co-sensitization systems, their UV-vis absorption spectra in DCM (1 × 10−5 mol L−1) solutions and on the TiO2 films were recorded and are shown in Fig. 4, and the corresponding data are listed in Table 1.

It can be seen from Fig. 4(a) that the λmax value of 4OBA, 8OBA, and 12OBA is 289 nm. The extension of the terminal oxyalkyl chains does not affect their absorption ranges. After mixing (Fig. 4(b)), the co-sensitizers (4OBA, 8OBA, and 12OBA) and the main dye (NP-1) have a synergistic effect, and two clear absorption bands can be observed. This synergistic effect results in the gradually enhanced molar absorbance in the UV region and a slight attenuation of the absorption intensity in the visible region.41,42 When these co-sensitizers and the main dye are adsorbed on TiO2 thin films (Fig. 4(c)), they have similar absorption bands, but their absorption intensity is attenuated in different degrees, implying the different co-sensitization effect.
2.3. Electrochemical properties
To investigate the electron transfer from the excited-state sensitizers to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and the regeneration of the sensitizers,26,43 cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in DCM and the CV plots are shown in Fig. 5(a). The corresponding data are listed in Table 2. The EHOMO energy levels are calculated from the first oxidation potential, while the ELUMO energy levels are calculated in combination with UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. All the co-sensitization systems exhibit oxidation/reduction processes in the positive potential range and reduction/oxidation processes in the negative potential range, indicating that they possess both electron and hole transport capabilities.44–46 As shown in Fig. 5(b), the EHOMO energy levels of the co-sensitization systems are lower than the redox potentials of I−/I3− (−4.60 eV vs. vacuum34), which is beneficial for all the sensitizers to obtain electrons from the electrodes and promote the regeneration of the sensitizer molecules. The ELUMO energy levels of NP-1, NP-1@4OBA, NP-1@8OBA, and NP-1@12OBA are −3.63 eV, −3.55 eV, −3.53 eV, and −3.58 eV, which are higher than that of the TiO2 conduction band (−4.00 eV vs. vacuum37,47), meaning that the excited electrons can be effectively injected into the TiO2 conduction band. Considering that the main dye does not change, the variation of ELUMO energy levels should be attributed to the interaction between NP-1 and nOBA molecules.

To investigate the thermodynamic feasibility of dye injection, recombination, and regeneration processes of NP-1, NP-1@4OBA, NP-1@8OBA, and NP-1@12OBA, the free energies (ΔGinj, ΔGrec, and ΔGreg) are estimated using eqn (1)–(4)48,49 and the corresponding data are given in Table 2. Ered = Eox − E0–0(1) ΔGinj = Ered − ECB(2) ΔGrec = ECB − Eox(3) ΔGreg = EI3−/I− − Eox(4)
The effective driving force for the electron injection (ΔGinj) of the dye from the excited state to the TiO2 CB is calculated, and the result satisfies the basic energy requirement of the DSSC devices in the order NP-1 (2.91 eV) > NP-1@12OBA (2.86 eV) > NP-1@4OBA (2.83 eV) > NP-1@8OBA (2.81 eV). These results can predict that NP-1@8OBA can inject electrons into TiO2 CB more efficiently than other co-sensitized systems. The ΔGrec values of the dyes are −5.07 eV (NP-1), −5.00 eV (NP-1@4OBA), −4.99 eV (NP-1@8OBA), and −5.03 eV (NP-1@12OBA), respectively. The Greg values of similar dyes are NP-1 (−5.67 eV) < NP-1@12OBA (−5.63 eV) < NP-1@4OBA (−5.60 eV) < NP-1@8OBA (−5.59 eV). Clearly, 8OBA has a molecular size similar to NP-1, which results in the highest free energy for NP-1@8OBA during electron regeneration to resist the recombination between injected electrons and photo-oxidized dye molecules.22,50,51
2.4. Photovoltaic performances of DSSCs
The photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs, including Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE, are summarized in Table 3. Photocurrent–voltage (J–V) and the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) are shown in Fig. 6. Compared with the reference device NP-1 (PCE = 4.26%), the co-DSSCs based on NP-1@4OBA, NP-1@8OBA and NP-1@12OBA are 4.55%, 4.36%, and 4.07%, respectively. Among them, the device with NP-1@4OBA has the highest PCE because of the optimal molecular matching between the co-sensitizer 4OBA and the main dye NP-1. The small-size co-sensitizers could fill the gap between the large-size dyes, resulting in a decrease in electron recombination from the TiO2 to the iodine electrolyte as suggested by the dark-currents in Fig. 6(a). The synergistic enhancement of Jsc and FF results in a significantly improved PCE. The enhanced Jsc can be explained by the broadened light-harvesting range, while the increased FF might be attributed to the inhibition of intermolecular aggregation and charge recombination.52 Therefore, the suitable molecular size makes 4OBA a more effective co-sensitizer for NP-1.53

 Fig. 6  (a) J–V and dark-current curves of DSSCs based on NP-1, NP-1@4OBA, NP-1@8OBA and NP-1@12OBA, and (b) their IPCE spectra. 
To further understand the effect of co-sensitization on the spectral response, IPCE spectra are investigated and are shown in Fig. 6(b), and the corresponding data are listed in Table 3. It is well known that the quantum conversion yield in the spectral response region determines the generation of the photocurrent.14 The overall spectral response is clearly observed in the 300–700 nm range, which is largely provided by the main dye NP-1.54 In addition, the characteristic peaks of the IPCE spectra of the co-DSSCs based on NP-1@4OBA, NP-1@8OBA and NP-1@12OBA are at 439 nm, 465 nm, and 445 nm, respectively. The IPCE values gradually decrease with the increase of terminal chains. Although the increased oxyalkyl chains of the co-sensitizers could enhance the shielding effect to inhibit electron recombination, the mutual entanglement between the terminal oxyalkyl chains may affect the electron transport, eventually resulting in a low IPCE of co-DSSCs. Moreover, the integrated current densities calculated from IPCE (JIPCEsc) show a basically consistent trend with the Jsc values of the J–V curves.14,55
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to elucidate the interfacial electron recombination process under dark conditions to analyze the interfacial electron transport properties of DSSCs. Fig. 7 shows the Nyquist and Bode phase diagrams of DSSCs.
 Fig. 7  EIS spectra for DSSCs: (a) Nyquist and (b) Bode phase plots. 
In the Nyquist plot, the larger the semicircle corresponding to the low frequency range, the lower the electron recombination rate trend, the higher the Voc, and the smaller the dark current. It is obvious that the radius of the large semicircles decreases sequentially, i.e., NP-1@8OBA > NP-1 > NP-1@12OBA > NP-1@4OBA, indicating that the recombination rate at the photoanode interface increases sequentially under dark conditions. The trend of Rec (the charge transfer resistance of TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface) is basically consistent with the trend of Voc, which is closely related to the electron lifetime (τe). The frequency peaks in the Bode phase diagram reflects the charge transport process of the injected electrons in TiO2. The electron lifetime can be calculated by the formula τe = 1/2πωmax (ωmax is the frequency corresponding to the peak value).37ωmax decreases in the order of NP-1@8OBA > NP-1 > NP-1@12OBA > NP-1@4OBA, indicating that τe decreases in the same order.
2.5. Application evaluation
Solar cells in practical applications are often exposed to different environments, not one-sun illumination (I0 = 100 mA cm−2), so the photovoltaic performances under different irradiations (I0 = 100, 80, 60, 40 and 20 mA cm−2) are very necessary. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The relationship between the photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs and the bias light intensity is shown in Fig. 8 (Fig. S10, ESI†).
 Fig. 8  The relationship between the PCEs of DSSCs and the bias light intensity. 
The PCEs show a linear downward trend with the decrease in bias light intensity. The slopes of the linear fitting equations for NP-1, NP-1@4OBA, NP-1@8OBA, and NP-1@12OBA are 0.040, 0.043, 0.042, and 0.038, respectively. By contrast, the slope of NP-1@4OBA is largest, indicating that its PCE decay is more pronounced. It can be seen that the Jsc decay slopes of NP-1 and NP-1@4OBA are very similar, while the Voc decay slopes are significantly different. Therefore, it can be inferred that the PCE decay is more related to Voc decay. This may be due to slower photoelectron production and faster electron recombination under weak light conditions.
3. Conclusions
Three biphenylcarboxylic acid co-sensitizers (4OBA, 8OBA and 12OBA) with different terminal oxyalkyl chains were synthesized and co-sensitized respectively with the main dye (NP-1) to construct co-DSSCs. Compared with the PCE of the reference device with NP-1, those of the co-DSSCs with NP-1@4OBA, NP-1@8OBA, and NP-1@12OBA are improved by 6.8%, 2.4%, and −4.5%, respectively. The reason for this is that the small-size co-sensitizer 4OBA has the best molecular matching structure to NP-1 in the co-sensitization system, which not only increases the molecular coverage on the TiO2 surface, but also reduces the electron recombination, hence resulting in the improved photovoltage of the co-DSSCs with NP-1@4OBA. In addition, their complementary spectral responses significantly increase the light-harvesting capability of co-DSSCs, so exhibiting the enhanced photocurrent. The co-DSSCs with NP-1@12OBA yields the lowest PCE value due to the mutual entanglement of the longest oxyalkyl chains affecting the electronic transmission. Moreover, the photovoltaic performances under different irradiation can provide an important basis for the application evaluation of co-DSSCs.

DSC curves were obtained using a differential scanning calorimeter (Metter Toledo DSC3+). TGA curves were measured using a professional synchronous thermal analyzer (Q1000DSC + LNCS + FACS Q600SDT).
4.2. Synthesis and characterization

Synthesis of series nOBA. 
In a 150 mL 3-necked flask, 4′-hydroxy-[1,1′-biphenyl]-4-carboxylic acid (14.00 mmol), bromoalkane (14.00 mmol), K2CO3 (35.01 mmol), and N,N-dimethylformamide (40 mL) were added in turn. Following this, the reaction mixture was stirred for 12 h at 40 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was poured into dichloromethane (200 mL). The combined organic layers were acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid solution and then washed with water. After removing the solvent, the product obtained was purified through column chromatography.

4.3. Photophysical and electrochemical measurements
UV-vis absorption spectra of the dyes in DCM (1 × 10−5 mol L−1) solution and on TiO2 films (6.5 μm) were recorded with a UV2550 spectrophotometer. In order to ensure the reliability of the spectroscopic data, the final results are often the average of multiple measurements.
Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were recorded on an electrochemical workstation (CIMPS-2, Zahner, Germany) at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 under a N2 atmosphere. Working electrode: glassy carbon; counter electrode: Pt wire; reference electrode: non-aqueous Ag/Ag+ electrode; supporting electrolyte: DCM solution containing 0.1 mol L−1 tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6). The redox potentials are calibrated with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the internal reference. The concentration used for CV measurement is 1 × 10−4 mol L−1 in DCM.
EIS spectra in the dark were also recorded with the electrochemical workstation (CIMPS-2, Zahner, Germany) at frequencies of 0.01–100 kHz. The magnitude of the alternative signal was 10 mV. Charge-transfer resistances were determined by fitting the impedance spectra using Z-view software.
4.4. Device fabrication and photovoltaic measurements
The active area of the TiO2 film is approximately 0.25 cm2. The TiO2 film was immersed in a dye bath (a mixture of dyes NP-1 and nOBA, in which the dye concentration is 1 × 10−4 mol L−1, and the solution is 1:1 (v/v) acetonitrile/tert-butanol) by a cocktail sensitization method (coded as NP-1@nOBA), and then soaked for 24 h at room temperature in the dark. The sensitizer is adsorbed to the corresponding TiO2 film. The fabrication process of DSSCs was performed according to the published method.55 The J–V characteristics of the DSSCs were measured under illumination with AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) from a 300 W xenon lamp solar simulator (QTest 2000AAA Station, Crowntech, USA). The incident light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 with a standard silicon solar cell. The action spectra of monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for solar cells were investigated on a commercial setup (QTest Hifinity 5, Crowntech, USA).
