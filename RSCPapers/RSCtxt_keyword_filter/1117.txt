    , Accepted 29th January 2018First published on 30th January 2018AbstractWe have used two unsymmetrical small molecules, named phenothiazine 1 and 2 with a D–A–D–π–D configuration, where phenothiazine is used as a central unit, triphenylamine is used as a terminal unit and TCBD and cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-diylidene-expanded TCBD are used as an acceptor between the phenothiazine and triphenylamine units, as a small molecule donor along with PC71BM as an acceptor for solution processed bulk heterojunction solar cells. The variation of acceptors in the phenothiazine derivatives makes an exciting change in the photophysical and electrochemical properties, hole mobility and therefore photovoltaic performance. The optimized device based on phenothiazine 2 exhibited a high power conversion efficiency of 7.35% (Jsc = 11.98 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.99 V and FF = 0.62), while the device based on phenothiazine 1 showed a low PCE of 4.81% (Jsc = 8.73 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.95 V and FF = 0.58) after solvent vapour annealing (SVA) treatment. The higher value of power conversion efficiency of the 2 based devices irrespective of the processing conditions may be related to the broader absorption and lower band gap of 2 as compared to 1. The improvement in the SVA treated active layer may be related to the enhanced crystallinity, molecular ordering and aggregation and shorter π–π stacking distance of the small molecule donors.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) consisting of a blend of donor (p-type) and acceptor (n-type) organic semiconductors have gained a lot of attention from the scientific community due to the advantages such as solution processability, flexibility making them compatible toward flexible substrates and low cost of fabrication as compared to their inorganic counterparts.1 The concept of a bulk heterojunction for polymer solar cells using blended systems of conjugated polymer (donor):fullerene (acceptor) and polymer donor:polymer acceptor was introduced by Heeger and Friend research groups, in which the interface between the donor and acceptor provides pathways for charge generation, separation, and transportation.2 Over the past decade, considerable progress has been made mainly in the design of strongly absorbing organic semiconducting materials, morphology of the BHJ active layer, and device engineering. After these efforts, the power conversion efficiency of OSCs based on BHJ active layers based on a polymer donor and fullerene and non-fullerene acceptor has been considerably increased to the range of 11–13%.3
In spite of these advancements, the use of polymers suffers from several drawbacks related to their synthesis with batch-to-batch variation, polydispersity and impurities due to difficult purification. To minimize the limitations of polymer-based solar cells, the research has diverted to “small molecule” based bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs), where polymer donors are replaced by smaller conjugated molecular systems developed with well-defined molecular architectures with desired frontier molecular orbital energies to match the light harvesting of the best performing polymeric materials.4 The small molecule BHJ organic solar cells exhibit high efficiency with additional treatment of the active layer such as solvent vapor treatment and thermal annealing to optimize the morphology and donor/acceptor interpenetrating network. Recently, the PCE of SM-BHJs has reached the range of 11–12%,4b,5 and it can be expected to increase because of the continuous development of new active materials, increased understanding of nanoscale morphology, and improved device architecture, which together offer a promising future for photovoltaic technology based on small molecules.
Phenothiazine is an important class of heterocyclic compound with non-planar geometry due to the presence of electron-rich nitrogen and sulphur hetero atoms in the tricyclic ring, and its derivatives have been extensively used for chemical sensors, photovoltaic devices, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs).6
Phenothiazine derivatives exhibit good film-forming properties, high hole mobility and strong light-harvesting capabilities.7 Recently, a number of acceptors have been used in phenothiazine derivatives to enhance the power conversion efficiency.8 The cross conjugation methodology has emerged as a new type of synthetic process to design low HOMO–LUMO gap small molecular systems. The cross conjugated systems of 1,1,4,4-tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD) and cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-diylidene-expanded TCBD derivatives have gained great attention in photovoltaic devices due to strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and lower HOMO–LUMO gaps.9
Herein, we investigated two unsymmetrical small molecules, named phenothiazine 1 and 2 with a D–A–D–π–D configuration, where the phenothiazine is used as a central unit, triphenylamine is used as a terminal unit and TCBD and cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-diylidene-expanded TCBD are used as an acceptor between the phenothiazine and triphenylamine units. The variation of acceptors in the phenothiazine derivatives causes an impressive change in the photophysical and electrochemical properties, hole mobility and device performance. The optimized device based on phenothiazine 2 exhibited a high PCE of 7.35% (Jsc = 11.98 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.99 V and FF = 0.62), while the device based on phenothiazine 1 showed a low PCE of 4.81% (Jsc = 8.73 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.95 V and FF = 0.58) after solvent vapour annealing (SVA) treatment.
Experimental details
The syntheses of small molecules 1 and 2 and their characterization are reported in our earlier report10 and the chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1.

Device fabrication and characterization
The OSCs were fabricated with a conventional structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/1 or 2:PC71BM/PFN/Al. The alcohol-soluble conjugated polymer poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) was used as a cathode interfacial layer. The ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol for 15 min each and subsequently dried in a vacuum oven for 15 min at a temperature of 40 °C. Then a thin layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was spin-coated onto the pre-cleaned ITO coated glass substrate at 3500 rpm for 40 s and subsequently baked at 110 °C for 20 min and allowed to cool to room temperature. In order to deposit the thin film of the active layer, a mixture of 1 or 2 with PC71BM with different weight ratios in chloroform (total concentration 16 mg mL−1) was spin coated at 2000 rpm for 20 s on the top of the PEDOT:PSS substrate and then dried at room temperature. After the active spin coating, SVA was used to tune the morphology of the blend film. For SVA, the films were placed in a glass petri-dish containing 1 mL of carbon disulphide (CS2) for 40 s. The thickness of the active layer is about 90 nm ± 5 nm. Subsequently, a thin film of PFN was spin coated from a PFN solution in methanol and dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature for 90 s. Finally, an aluminum (Al) layer was deposited by thermal evaporation under vacuum (ca. 10−5 Pa) through a mask, yielding four individual devices with 16 mm2 effective area. The devices for hole mobility measurement were fabricated with an architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SMs-donor:PC71BM/Au.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OSCs were recorded using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit under simulated AM 1.5G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, calibrating with the standard silicon solar cell. The monochromatic incident-photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were collected illuminating the device using a monochromator and the resultant current at short circuit condition was measured using the Keithley electrometer. The hole mobility measurements were conducted in the dark using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit system.
Results and discussion
Optical and electrochemical properties
As shown in Fig. 2, in chloroform solution at room temperature, phenothiazine 1 exhibits a strong and broad intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) band in the region of 400–700 nm with an extinction coefficient of 1.7 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 498 nm, whereas the phenothiazine 2 exhibits a strong π–π* transition with an extinction coefficient of 2 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 450 nm and an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition with a maximum extinction coefficient of 2 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 648 nm. The ICT band of phenothiazine 2 exhibits a redshift of 150 nm as compared to phenothiazine 1 due to the increased effective π-conjugation after incorporation of the cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-diylidene-expanded TCBD moiety, which was further explained by TD-DFT calculation on the dichloromethane phase. The absorption bands in the thin film spectra were significantly red shifted and broadened as compared to in solution, which is beneficial for spectral overlap with the solar spectrum. Both small molecules showed a vibronic shoulder at longer wavelengths, attributed to effective intermolecular π–π stacking in the molecular backbone in the solid state.11 The optical bandgap of phenothiazine 1 and 2 was estimated from the onset absorption edge in the absorption spectra of the thin films and is about 1.78 eV and 1.53 eV, respectively. The reduced optical bandgap for 2 as compared to 1 may be due to the stronger electron withdrawing ability of the cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-diylidene-expanded TCBD units as compared to TCBD.

The electrochemical properties of phenothiazines 1 and 2 were measured by cyclic voltammetry studies (Fig. S1, ESI†) and are summarized in Table 1. The experimental HOMO energy levels of 1 and 2 were calculated from the onset oxidation potential (Eonset) using HOMO = −q(Eonset + 4.4) eV. The LUMO energy levels of 1 and 2 were calculated using LUMO = HOMO − E0–0, where the E0–0 is the onset absorption edge in solution. The corresponding HOMO and LUMO energy levels of phenothiazines 1 and 2 are −5.21, −5.24 eV and −3.34, −3.70 eV respectively. The HOMO energy level of both phenothiazines 1 and 2 is the same but the LUMO energy level of phenothiazine 2 is lower than that of phenothiazine 1 due to the presence of the strong electron accepting nature of the cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-diylidene-expanded TCBD unit. Considering that PC71BM has HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −6.2 eV and −4.1 eV, respectively, the LUMO offset and HOMO offset between the donor and acceptor is larger than the exciton binding energy.12 Therefore, efficient exciton dissociation at the D/A interface and subsequent electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor and hole transfer from acceptor to donor in the BHJ active layer are feasible.

Theoretical calculation was performed by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G** level to understand the molecular optimized configurations and the frontier molecular orbitals of phenothiazines 1 and 2. The calculated orbital distributions of frontier molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The theoretically estimated HOMO energy levels for phenothiazines 1 and 2 are −5.05 eV and −5.08 eV and the corresponding LUMO energy levels are −2.98 eV and −3.45 eV. The incorporation of the strong acceptor TCBD and cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-diylidene-expanded TCBD units causes a nonplanar optimized structure and lowers the LUMO energy level, which results in a red shift in the electronic absorption. The TDDFT calculation was performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level on optimized phenothiazine 1 and CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level on optimized phenothiazine 2 in dichloromethane to estimate the absorption spectra, composition, oscillator strengths, and assignments, which are shown in Table 2.

The TD-DFT calculations show a single absorption band due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) at 486 nm for phenothiazine 1 whereas phenothiazine 2 exhibits two absorption bands in the visible region. Phenothiazine 2 exhibits intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) at 574 nm in the longer wavelength region and a π–π* transition at 335 nm in the lower wavelength region, respectively.13 In the theoretical UV/Vis spectra as well as the experimental spectra, phenothiazine 1 exhibits one electronic transition whereas phenothiazine 2 exhibits two electronic transitions related to π–π* and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions in the visible region.
Photovoltaic properties
The donor units 1 or 2 in combination with the acceptor unit PC71BM were exploited for designing organic BHJ solar cells with a typical solar cell structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/1 or 2:PC71BM/PFN/Al. The thickness of the active layer is 90 ± 5 nm. In order to achieve a better PCE in the BHJ solar cells, the relative concentrations of donor and acceptor used in the active layer need to be optimized so that the absorbance of solar photons and the subsequent charge transporting processes in the active layer can be controlled effectively. The acceptor concentration plays a crucial role as with a low concentration, the electron transporting ability gets reduced whereas a higher concentration dominates over the donor component (light absorbing unit) leading to poor absorbance in the active layer. The optimized weight ratio of SM and PC71BM determines the overall outcome of the devices and it was found that the optimized weight ratio was 1:2. Fig. 3a and b represents the current–voltage (J–V) co-relation under illumination (AG1.5, 100 mW cm−2) and incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the optimized BHJ organic solar cells, respectively, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. The PCEs for devices based on the optimized 1:PC71BM and 2:PC71BM active layers processed with CF (chloroform) were found to be 1.90% (Jsc = 6.26 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.98 V and FF = 0.36) and 3.21% (Jsc = 9.07 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.04 V and FF = 0.34), respectively. There is a close congruence between the IPCE spectra of the devices and the absorption spectra of the corresponding BHJ active layers (as shown in Fig. 4), which indicates that both PC71BM and SM donors are responsible for the photocurrent generation. The absorption spectrum (Fig. 4) shows improved solar spectrum coverage of 2:PC71BM, revealing that the lower optical band gap value of 2 improves the value of Jsc. The higher values of both Jsc and FF promote a higher value of the PCE for 2:PC71BM. Moreover, the comparatively broader IPCE spectrum of 2:PC71BM than that of 1:PC71BM indicates a larger value of Jsc for the 2:PC71BM active layer based devices. It was observed that the values of Voc for the devices based on 1 and 2 are almost same, and this can be ascribed to the similar HOMO energy level for both the molecules, since the Voc represents the direct energy difference between the donor and acceptor components employed in the active layer. The reason for the slightly higher value of Voc for the 2 based device (1.04 V) than the 1 one (0.98 V) may be attributed to the slightly deeper HOMO energy level of 4. The difference in Voc of the two devices is only 0.06 V, whereas the difference in the HOMO levels of 1 and 2 is 0.03 eV; the increased Voc difference may be because of the reduced voltage losses at the interfaces between the active layer and the cathode and anode.

In spite of the quite high Voc, the overall PCE of these devices is quite low, mainly related to the small values of both Jsc and FF. This may be attributed to the un-optimized nano-scale morphologies of the active layers processed with chloroform solvent. An optimal morphology is crucial for the exciton dissociation into free charge carriers and their transportation through the active layer towards the electrodes and final collection. Among the different methods used to improve the nanoscale morphology of the active layer, solvent vapour annealing is an efficient method to control the morphology of the active layer. SVA was chosen over thermal annealing as it has demonstrated a superior ability in controlling the crystallization process of small molecule donors in SM BHJ based OSCs.14 During SVA treatment the solvent vapours diffuse into the active layer and induce the reorganization of SM donor/acceptor across the bulk which significantly changes the phase separation between donor and acceptor.15 Recently, carbon disulphide (CS2), which is a non-halogenated solvent, has been reported as effective for SVA treatment of the active layer, and the overall PCE of the resulting OSCs has been significantly enhanced as compared to their as-cast counterpart.16 We have used CS2 for SVA treatment due to its high vapour pressure over others and because these small molecules have medium solubility in CS2. Moreover, PC71BM exhibits better solubility in CS2 as compared to other solvents such as tetrahydrofuran. Therefore, the combination of high vapour pressure and medium solubility of the small molecule donor implies fast vapour penetration in the active layer. The current–voltage characteristics under illumination and IPCE spectra of the OSCs fabricated from the SVA-treated active layers are shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. After the SVA treatment (40 s) of the blend film, the resultant OSCs showed significant enhancement in overall PCE, i.e. 4.81% (Jsc = 8.73 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.95 V and FF = 0.58) and 7.35% (Jsc = 11.98 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.99 V and FF = 0.62), for 1 and 2, respectively. Despite the slight drop in Voc, the values of both Jsc and FF were significantly increased, leading to higher values in PCEs of the OSCs. The enhancement in Jsc and FF may be attributed to the fact that during SVA, the solvent molecules inside the BHJ film can promote the crystallization and aggregation of donor materials.16a The IPCE spectra of the OSCs are shown in Fig. 3b, and it was found that the IPCE values are higher for the SVA-treated devices as compared to that of the as-cast counterparts, indicating that the charge separation and collection processes in the OSCs based on the SVA-treated blend film are more efficient than those of the as-cast counterparts. The Jsc values estimated from the integration of IPCE spectra are about 8.65 mA cm−2 and 11.83 mA cm−2 for the SVA-treated 1 and 2 blend films, respectively. The higher value of Jsc for the 2 based OSCs as compared to the 1 counterpart may be related to the wider absorption spectra of the 2:PC71BM blend film.
We have observed that for the SVA treatment beyond 40 s, both Jsc and FF drastically drops, while Voc remains almost constant. The PCE of the 2:PC71BM based OSc reduced to 5.63% (Jsc = 10.76 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.97 V and FF = 0.54) and 3.22% (Jsc = 7.14 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.96 V and FF = 0.47) when the active layer is subjected to 60 s and 90 s, respectively. In the SVA treatment, the crystallites of donor materials are grown, but when we kept for longer time, it causes over grow (>exciton diffusion length) as large as the film thickness, and the active layer can no longer form the BHJ networks. The large domains are not desirable for charge generation, leading to the reduction in both Jsc and FF.
Since both the OSCs based on 1 and 2 showed similar trends in the photovoltaic response when the SVA treated blend film was used as the active layer, we will discuss the effect of SVA only for the 2 based devices. The Jsc of the OSCs is mainly related to the absorption property of the active layers and charge transport within the active layers, and therefore, in order to get further information about the differences of photovoltaic performance for these two small molecules and processing conditions, the absorption and charge transport properties were investigated. To tentatively explain the higher performance of the SVA treated PSCs, the absorption spectra of SVA untreated and treated 2:PC71BM active layers are presented in Fig. 4. The SVA treated active layer showed red shifted absorption compared to that for the as cast counterpart. As said above, this spectral behavior is also similar to the IPCE spectrum. Moreover, the absorption intensity also increased for the film that underwent the SVA treatment, notably for the absorption band in the 550–850 nm range associated with 2 in the blend. The absorption efficiency (ηA) of the as cast and SVA treated 2:PC71BM films with the same thickness was determined by the following expression,  where S(λ) is the number of photons available (photon flux) at a particular wavelength λ with an AM 1.5G solar condition, α is the absorption coefficient and d is the thickness of the film. The ηA values are calculated from integration of the absorbance versus wavelength from 350 to 850 nm for the as cast (41.34%) and SVA treated 2:PC71BM films (47.21%). The resulting values indicate that more excitons are formed in the SVA treated active layer than the as cast counterpart, which may explain, in part, the larger values of IPCE and Jsc.
The hole mobilities of 1 and 2 in the blend films were measured by using the J–V characteristics of the hole only devices (Fig. 5) and the space charge limited current (SCLC) model was applied to calculate average mobility values for 8 devices. The average hole mobility values are 7.87 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.04 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 2 in the as cast and SVA treated 2:PC71BM active layers, respectively. However, there is a slight change in the electron mobility values, measured from dark J–V characteristics of an electron only device. The improved hole mobility and better balance between the electron and hole mobilities after the SVA treatment could promote charge transport and reduced charge recombination, leading to an improvement in Jsc and FF, and thereby PCE. Moreover, the hole mobility in 2:PC71BM is higher than that of 1:PC71BM (6.23 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for as cast and SVA processing conditions, respectively) irrespective of processing conditions, which may be one of the reasons for the high values of FF and PCE for the former OSCs.

The increased values of Jsc and FF are also evidenced by the variation of estimated series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) (see Table 2). The decreased Rs and increase of Rsh are in line with increased charge collection probability, which originates from the higher and more balanced electron/hole mobilities.17
The variation of Voc with illumination intensity (Pin) can be used to illustrate the order of recombination processes in the BHJ active layer (Fig. 6a). The semi-logarithmic plots of Voc depend linearly on the illumination intensity with a slope of kT/q (where k, T, and q are the Boltzmann's constant, temperature, and electronic charge) for bimolecular recombination. The slope greater than kT/q corresponds to the trap assisted recombination.18 For the 2:PC71BM SVA processed device, the slope is about 1.17kT/q, indicating the presence of trap assisted recombination in these OSCs. This value was smaller than that of the as cast processed device (1.48kT/q), indicating that the trap-assisted recombination was reduced using SVA treatment. The higher value of the slope for the OSC based on the as cast active layers may be attributed to the poor nanoscale morphology and poor interface (low value of Rsh) leading to considerable charge accumulation and therefore charge extraction. The variation of Jsc with Pin for these organic solar cells (as shown in Fig. 6b) can be expressed by a power law, i.e. Jsc ∝ Pαin. The exponent factor α is close to unity when the bimolecular recombination is weak during the charge transport through the active layer towards electrodes, while α < 1 is indicative of considerable bimolecular recombination and /or build-up of space charge.19 The slope (α) of the plots shown in Fig. 6b was estimated to be 0.86 and 0.95 for the as cast and SVA treated 2:PC71BM based OSCs, respectively. The higher value of ‘α’ for the SVA based OSC than that for the as cast counterpart, suggests that the bimolecular recombination was effectively suppressed, leading to the higher Jsc and FF for the devices based on SVA-treated active layers.

In order to get information about the difference in performance of OSCs based on different active layers, i.e. based on as-cast and SVA-treated active layers of these SMs, the relationship between the photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) of the OSCs was investigated and is shown in Fig. 7. Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current density under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is expressed as Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage. The Jph–Veff plots show that photocurrent significantly improved with SVA treatment. The Jph value of OSCs based on the SVA-treated and as cast 2:PC71BM active layers started to saturate at a Veff valve of 0.5 V and 1.3 V, respectively, and completely saturated at Veff = 2.3 V and 1.4 V, respectively. This result suggests that photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and are collected at electrodes very efficiently, with little germinate or bimolecular recombination, resulting in an enhanced FF. In contrast, the OSCs based on the as-cast active layers did not show clear saturation in Jph with increasing Veff. The field independent saturation in the SVA-treated OSCs suggests negligible trapped charges and efficient charge extraction. With regard to the 2 blend OSC without SVA, significant hole–electron recombination is expected, where a stronger internal electric field is needed to sweep out the photogenerated charge carriers and separate the bound e–h pairs.20 The charge dissociation probability (Pc) estimated from the ratio of Jph/Jsat (Jsat is the saturation photocurrent) at short circuit conditions is 0.86 and 0.95 for the as-cast and SVA-treated 2:PC71BM devices, respectively. The higher values of Pc for the SVA-processed devices indicate improved exciton dissociation efficiency.

The morphology of the active layers was investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. 8 for the as cast and SVA treated 2:PC71BM blend films. As shown in the TEM images, before SVA, the blend film displayed a smooth and uniform morphology and did not show any clear phase separation to provide good transporting pathways for charge transport, which resulted in low values of FF and Jsc. After SVA treatment, the blend film showed much more phase separation and slightly larger aggregation domain sizes than those without SVA. As a result, the increased phase separation and appropriate aggregated domain size of the donor and acceptor in the blend film provided continuous pathways for charge separation and transport, leading to the enhanced values of FF and Jsc, and thereby improved PCE.

In order to study the effect of SVA on the molecular packing and crystallinity of the active layer, XRD analysis was performed and results are shown in Fig. 9 for 2:PC71BM. The as-cast 2:PC71BM film shows a broad and weak peak at 2θ = 4.96°, corresponding to the (100) diffraction of the d-spacing, indicating a low degree of crystallinity. This peak shifted to 2θ = 5.21° and also become much stronger for the SVA treated blend film indicating that the SVA treatment promotes the crystallization of 2 with different molecular arrangements,21 which is beneficial for charge transport. A diffraction peak corresponding to π–π stacking (010) appeared at 2θ = 22.14° and 22.56° for the as cast and SVA treated 2:PC71BM films with a stacking distance of 0.44 nm and 0.39 nm, respectively, and the intensity of this peak also increased for the SVA treated active layer. The peak at 2θ = 18.24 observed in the XRD patterns in the blended film was assigned to diffraction originating from the clusters of PC71BM. Therefore, with SVA, the small molecule packing was enhanced and led to greater crystallinity and a shorter π–π distance than that of the as-cast film. The shorter π–π stacking distance and higher crystallinity are beneficial for charge transport in the active layer, as confirmed from the charge carrier mobility measurements.

Conclusions
In summary, two unsymmetrical small molecules, named phenothiazine 1 and 2 with a D–A–D–π–D configuration, where phenothiazine is used as a central unit, triphenylamine as a terminal unit and TCBD and cyclohexa-2,5-diene-1,4-diylidene-expanded TCBD as an acceptor between the phenothiazine and triphenylamine units, as a small molecule donor along with PC71BM as the acceptor for solution processed bulk heterojunction solar cells. After optimizing the weight ratio between the donor (1 or 2) and PC71BM and solvent vapour annealing, the PCE values of 4.81% and 7.35% were achieved for 1 and 2 based OSCs, respectively. The higher values of PCE for the 4 based OSCs as compared to the 3 counterpart may be attributed to the broader absorption spectra and lower bandgap of 2. The improvement in the PCE of OSCs based on an active layer processed with SVA is related to the efficient photogenerated exciton dissociation and charge collection due to the favourable phase separation interpenetrating pathways, improved molecular ordering and aggregation, and shorter π–π stacking distance induced by SVA treatments.
