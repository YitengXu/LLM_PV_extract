    , Accepted 10th December 2018First published on 11th December 2018AbstractSeleno twisted benzodiperylenediimides (TBDPDI-Se) as promising electron acceptor chromophores were designed and synthesized using a facile strategy with which different side chains could be introduced readily. Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells based on these acceptors exhibit the highest power conversion efficiency of 7.41% without any additive treatment.
In recent decades, bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJOSCs) have attracted considerable attention owing to their advantages of low-cost, light-weight, and flexible devices.1 Electron donors and acceptors are both necessary in BHJOSCs. Compared to high performance donors, excellent acceptors are still scarce. Fullerene derivatives such as PC61BM and PC71BM have been dominant electron acceptors for a long period of time, and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of fullerene-based BHJOSCs has exceeded 12%.2 However, fullerene acceptors suffer from several drawbacks such as high cost, limited absorption, difficulty in structural modification, and poor flexibility. Much research efforts have been shifted to non-fullerene acceptors recently. Among these non-fullerene acceptors, perylene/naphthalene diimide-based acceptors3 and ITIC derivatives4 are two promising classes (Fig. S1, ESI†). Perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (PDI, Fig. 1) derivatives are attractive due to their high electron mobility, tuneable and strong absorption, and favourable energy level alignments, which afford high performance devices capable of competing with fullerenes.

PDI-based acceptors include polymers and small molecule acceptors (SMAs). Compared to polymeric ones, SMAs have advantages such as precise structure, high purity, and excellent reproducibility.5 Single PDI with a planar conjugated core has too strong aggregation to achieve suitable domain size for efficient exciton dissociation. Therefore, functionalization of PDI on the bay, ortho, and imide positions was carried out to obtain twisted conjugated systems with weaker aggregation, which led to better phase separation in BHJOSCs. Three-dimensional ladder-type conjugation is an effective route to design high performance SMAs, which could break the coplanarity of the conjugated backbone and afford semiconductors with proper aggregation and high mobility.6 In ladder-type SMAs, the conjugated cores are connected by double bonds or aromatic units, which are beneficial for efficient intramolecular charge transport. Generally, organic molecules with twisted conformations are less likely to form compact and long-range π–π stacks than planar organic molecules. It is challenging to design high performance acceptors which can form suitable π–π stacks for charge transport and favourable phase separation during processing.
Although the highest PCE of non-fullerene BHJOSCs is above 14%,7 and that of PDI-based BHJOSCs is 10.58%,5b solvent additives are indispensable to improve PCE for most of them. Processing additives such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), etc., with high boiling points could manipulate the nano-morphology of the active layer and increase the efficiency of BHJOSCs markedly. However, it is complex to optimize the ratio of additives and difficult to reproduce the device performance.8 The residual additive DIO was confirmed to decrease the photostability of the active layer and impede the studies of device physics.9 Therefore, it is essential to develop high performance semiconductors without any additives.10
Recently, Xia et al. reported a star-shaped PDI acceptor, which achieved a PCE of 8.28% without additives.11 Since it starts from PDIs directly, the introduction of short alkyl chains is impossible due to the limited solubility of PDI intermediates, while side chains have a great influence on the photovoltaic performance of organic semiconductors.
In our previous work, five TBDPDI (Fig. 1) acceptors with different alkyl chains were used in BHJOSCs, and it was proved that the side chains have a significant effect on the aggregation, phase separation, morphology, and charge transport of these acceptors. A highest PCE of 5% was obtained. However, the additive 1% DIO was necessary, and the PCE was only 3.7% without the external additive.12
Ladder-type TBDPDI-Se with selenium atoms at the bay position of TBDPDI (Fig. 1) was designed and synthesized in this work. The two PDI cores were fused with a benzene ring, and the target compound has a twisted conjugated system with a dihedral angle of 32° (determined by density functional theory calculation in the ESI†). A facile ester strategy was adopted, through which TBDPDI-Se with different side chains could be obtained readily. These acceptors exhibit broad and strong absorption in the range of 300–600 nm, high thermal stability, and low-lying LUMO energy levels around −3.70 eV. When matched with a suitable electron donor, a highest PCE of 7.41% was obtained without any solvent additive.
Since PDI derivatives usually have poor solubility due to their strong aggregation, it is difficult to modify the PDIs with short alkyl chains directly. In this work, an ester strategy featuring soluble intermediates was adopted to accomplish efficient synthesis of target compounds.
As shown in Scheme 1, target compounds were synthesized in eight steps from commercially available perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride (PTCDA). 3,4,9,10-Tetra-(n-butyl-carbonyl)-perylene (1), 1-nitro-3,4,9,10-tetra-(n-butyl-carbonyl)-perylene (2), and tetrakis-(butyl)peryleno[1,12-bcd]selenophene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylate (3) were prepared according to a literature method.13

(a) (1) KOH, H2O, 70 °C, 70 min; (2) C4H9Br, (C8H17)4NBr, 100 °C, 2 h, 87%; (b) CH2Cl2, HNO3, 0 °C, 10 min, 79.5%; (c) selenium powder, N2, dry NMP, 170 °C, 8 h, 77%; (d) CH2Cl2, Br2, 0 °C, 15 min, 74%; (e) 1,4-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzene, THF, H2O, KCO3, Pd(PPh3)4, 85 °C, 13 h, 75%; (f) I2, CH2Cl2, hν, 8 h, 80%; (g) ClSO3H, rt, 4 h, quantitative yield; (h) imidazole, RNH2, 150 °C, 4 h, >41%. 
Bromination of 3 in CH2Cl2 at 0 °C led to 4 in 74% yield, and a large excess of Br2 was necessary. Otherwise, longer reaction times were needed, and more side products were observed.14 The Suzuki reaction of 4 with p-phenyleneboronic acid pinacol ester in aqueous THF afforded 5 in 75% yield.
Sunlight-induced cyclization of 5 with a catalytic amount of iodine produced 6 in 80% yield. The product was precipitated from the solvent, the solid was removed by filtration, and the filtrate was irradiated again. The above process was repeated until the starting material was converted thoroughly. In this reaction, oxygen in the air and catalyst I2 are both essential.
The key intermediate TBDPDA-Se was quantitatively obtained by hydrolysis of 6 in chlorosulfonic acid. TBDPDI-Se with different side chains could be obtained readily by the efficient condensation of TBDPDA-Se with different amines. Since TBDPDA-Se is insoluble in organic solvents, it was used in the next step without any purification and characterization, and similar hydrolysis of perylene esters to perylene dianhydrides has been reported many times.15 TBDPDI-Se-C11 and TBDPDI-Se-C23 were obtained by reaction of TBDPDA-Se with 1-pentylhexyl and 1-undecyldodecyl amines in imidazole. The two target compounds as orange solids show good solubility in common solvents like chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, and toluene, which makes them solution-processable.
New compounds 4, 5, 6, TBDPDI-Se-C11, and TBDPDI-Se-C23 were clearly characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS.
As determined by TGA measurements in the air, TBDPDI-Se-C11 and TBDPDI-Se-C23 exhibit good thermal stability, and the 5% weight loss temperatures are as high as 325 °C and 376 °C respectively (Fig. S2, ESI†). DSC traces of TBDPDI-Se-C11 and TBDPDI-Se-C23 show no phase transition from room temperature to 280 °C (Fig. S3, ESI†).
TBDPDI-Se-C11 and TBDPDI-Se-C23 have strong absorption in the range of 300–600 nm (Fig. S4 and S5, ESI†), with maximum molar extinction coefficients higher than 6 × 105 M−1 cm−1. Compared with solution absorption, the absorption edges of TBDPDI-Se-C11 and TBDPDI-Se-C23 in the film both display a bathochromic shift by about 30 nm because of molecular aggregation in the solid state. Their calculated optical bandgaps are 2.21 eV and 2.17 eV, which are 0.14 eV and 0.12 eV wider than those of TBDPDI, because the former shows lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels, as is confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation (Fig. S6, ESI†).
To study the energy levels of the two acceptors, their redox properties in the solid state were measured by cyclic voltammetry. Both of them showed a semi-reversible reduction peak, indicating their ability to accept at least one electron, and no oxidation peak was observed (Fig. S7, ESI†). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of TBDPDI-Se-C11 and TBDPDI-Se-C23 were calculated to be −3.73 eV and −3.71 eV, which are similar to those of TBDPDI acceptors (−3.72 to −3.75 eV) in our previous work.12 The reason is that the first electron-accepting position is at the oxygen atom in the carbonyl group due to its strong electron-withdrawing properties, and there is little energy difference on the carbonyl groups among these acceptors.16 The low-lying LUMO energy levels guarantee their excellent electron accepting ability. The detailed data are provided in Table 1. BHJOSCs were fabricated with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag, owing to their ease of manufacturing and environmental stability. Four widely used donor polymers PBDB-T, PTB7, PTB7-Th, and PDBT-T1 (their structures are in Fig. S8, ESI†) with complementary absorption and matched energy levels were selected to characterize the photoelectric properties of TBDPDI-Se. PBDB-T with the highest PCE performed best (Table S1, ESI†). Thus, it was selected as a matched donor for the comprehensive study of these solar cells.18 The device parameters for different donor:acceptor ratios and concentrations are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The optimal donor:acceptor weight ratio is 1.5:1. The optimized active layer thickness is about 110 nm determined by AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy).

The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the BHJOSCs measured under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 2a. The optimized device performance parameters are summarized in Table 2. The as-cast PBDB-T:TBDPDI-Se-C11 active layers gave a PCE of 6.37% with a Voc of 1.01 V, a Jsc of 10.91 mA cm−2, and an FF of 58.09%. However, the PCE of the PBDB-T:TBDPDI-Se-C23 device was only 4.10%. Adding four widely used solvent additives 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), 1-chloronaphthalene (CN), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), and 1.2-diphenoxyethane (DPE) resulted in lower PCEs for these BHJOSCs (Table S3, ESI†), which indicated that the TBDPDI-Se system was insensitive to common solvent additives. The device performances for different thermal annealing temperatures are summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). After the thermal annealing (TA) of active layers at 100 °C for 10 minutes, the devices based on TBDPDI-Se-C11 reached a highest PCE of 7.41%, while TBDPDI-Se-C23 only achieved the best PCE of 4.57% (Table 2). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices are shown in Fig. 2b. The EQE responses covered a wide range of 300–700 nm. The photon response between 300 and 520 nm is mainly contributed by the acceptor, while PBDB-T plays a dominant role from 520 to 700 nm. The EQE of TBDPDI-Se-C11 was much higher than that of TBDPDI-Se-C23 in the range of 350–650 nm. The as cast TBDPDI-Se-C11 and TBDPDI-Se-C23 based devices showed EQEs of 57% and 43% at 530 nm, which increased to 63% and 45% after thermal annealing treatment. These results were consistent with their different PCEs.

Electron transporting properties are another key factor for electron acceptors. The charge carrier mobilities of the two compounds were estimated using Mott-Gurney's space-charge-limit current (SCLC) method for ‘hole only’ (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag) and ‘electron only’ (ITO/ZnO/active layer/Ca/Al) devices. As shown in Table S5 and Fig. S9 (ESI†), the electron mobility (μe) of a TBDPDI-Se-C11 film was calculated to be 4.72 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is much higher than that of TBDPDI-Se-C23, indicating that long insulated chains would impede the charge transport. The as cast PBDB-T:TBDPDI-Se-C11 film shows a μe of 5.24 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas that of TBDPDI-Se-C23 exhibited a lower μe of 4.87 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1, which could be assigned to its inferior morphology. After thermal annealing, the mobilities of these blend films increased by several times. The higher and more balanced charge carrier mobility of active layers leads to a high performance of solar cells.
The charge separation and recombination probabilities of the two acceptors were measured to further study these devices.17 As shown in Fig. S10 (a and b, ESI†), the Pdiss values were calculated to be 70.2% and 57.3% for the TBDPDI-Se-C11- and TBDPDI-Se-C23-based devices, suggesting more efficient charge extraction of the BDPDI-Se-C11-based solar cells. On the other hand, after thermal annealing, their Pdiss values increased to 73.1% and 60.6%, respectively, which confirms that thermal annealing improves the charge extraction effectively.
As shown in Fig. S10 (c and d, ESI†), the slopes (α) were determined to be 0.91 and 0.89 for the TBDPDI-Se-C11- and TBDPDI-Se-C23-based devices. After thermal annealing, the α values increased to 0.95 and 0.93, which confirmed that bimolecular recombination was reduced through thermal annealing. The dependence of Voc on the light intensity was also evaluated, as shown in Fig. S10 (e and f, ESI†). The slopes (S) of the TBDPDI-Se-C11- and TBDPDI-Se-C23-based devices were calculated to be 1.78 kT/q and 1.91 kT/q, implying that the trap-assisted recombination for the TBDPDI-Se-C11-based device is less than that of TBDPDI-Se-C23. After thermal annealing, the slopes decreased to 1.53 kT/q and 1.67 kT/q. The result indicated that thermal annealing decreased interfacial surface trap densities between the active layer materials in the devices, suppressed trap-assisted recombination, and contributed to the higher PCE.
The morphology of the active layers is closely correlated with their mobility, Jsc, FF, and PCE. AFM and TEM were employed to investigate their morphology with and without thermal annealing.
AFM results were plotted as height (top) and phase (bottom) images in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The TBDPDI-Se-C11 and TBDPDI-Se-C23 based as-cast blend films showed similar root-mean-square (RMS) values of 7.51 nm and 7.15 nm. After thermal annealing, the RMS values decreased to 6.93 nm and 6.91 nm. The much smaller roughness and suitable fibril structure indicated the good miscibility of the donor and acceptor, which could lead to efficient bicontinuous interpenetrating networks for charge transport. Combining AFM and TEM images (Fig. S12, ESI†), the as-cast TBDPDI-Se-C11-based blend film exhibited a domain size of around 50 nm, while TBDPDI-Se-C23 showed a larger domain size. After thermal annealing, both of them showed smaller domain sizes. Proper phase separation and domain sizes of tens of nanometers were beneficial for exciton separation and charge transport, which contributes to the high performance of solar cells.
In summary, an excellent acceptor chromophore was designed and synthesized efficiently via a facile synthetic route, in which TBDPDI-Se with different side chains could be obtained conveniently. The twisted ladder-type TBDPDI-Se-C11 with high electron mobility, high thermal stability, and proper phase separation is an outstanding acceptor for additive-free BHJOSCs. Suitable side chains are essential for high performance solar cells; they play an important role in the formation of proper phase separation. Thermal annealing could optimize the charge separation, increase the μe and exciton dissociation efficiency, and inhibit charge recombination, which leads to higher solar cell performance. This work provides a strategy for the development of acceptors for additive-free solar cells.
