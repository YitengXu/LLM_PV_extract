    , Accepted 15th January 2021First published on 26th January 2021AbstractKesterite surface properties and band alignment behavior at an absorber/buffer interface are key issues for highly efficient kesterite solar cell devices. Herein, we report new insights into surface and interface engineering and favorable band alignment of Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe)/CdS buffer in solar cells via in situ formed ZnSe nanoparticles (NPs) on the CZTSe surface. The device characteristics and junction qualities of the CZTSe solar cells with in situ formed ZnSe NPs are improved even though they have similar bulk properties to CZTSe thin films. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization revealed a favorable conduction band offset (CBO, +0.26 eV) for CZTSe/ZnSe NPs/CdS compared to that for CZTSe/CdS (+0.01 eV) and CZTSe/ZnSe layer/CdS (+0.976 eV), respectively. In this regard, we also postulated a formation mechanism for in situ formed ZnSe NPs on the CZTSe surface via annealing of metallic precursors with different stacking orders. This work offers a simple and source-free interface engineering strategy using in situ formed ZnSe NPs (secondary phase) on the CZTSe surface to further improve the performance of kesterite solar cell devices.
Introduction
Earth-abundant element-based kesterite Copper–Zinc–Tin–Sulfo–Selenide Cu2ZnSn(Sx,Se1−x)4 (CZTSSe) has attracted intensive research interest as a promising absorber material for thin-film solar cells because of its outstanding properties and performance compatibility with Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) and CdTe.1–5 Nevertheless, the reported best performance of CZTSSe solar cells (12.62%)6 is far below that of CIGS7 and CdTe8 solar cells at 23%. A relatively large open-circuit voltage (Voc)-deficit characteristic, defined as Eg/q − Voc, where Eg is the band gap energy of the kesterite absorber and q is the electron charge, has been widely known as a key factor responsible for the stagnated power conversion efficiency (PCE) of thin-film solar cell devices.4,9–11 Experimentally, a Voc-deficit value of 0.589 V for the best efficiency CZTSSe solar cell12 is significantly larger than that of the best CIGS solar cells (0.310 V).13 Based on previous extensive studies, (i) high anti-site defects and related defect cluster densities,5,10,14 (ii) associated band tailing due to cationic disordering in bulk kesterite resulting in local fluctuations of Eg and/or Eg edges,9,15,16 (iii) unpassivated heterointerfaces such as kesterite/CdS and Mo/kesterite,17 and (iv) an undesirable conduction band offset (CBO)18–20 are believed to be the main causes of the Voc-deficit characteristics of kesterite-based solar cell devices. In particular, the suppression of unexpected phases such as binary and/or ternary compounds on the surface and/or near the back contact region in kesterite thin films is significantly difficult owing to the complex nature of multi-element composition.21–24 This often increases the possible formation of various point defects in kesterite. The antisite defect clusters (i.e., VCu + ZnCu, CuZn + SnZn, and 2CuZn + SnZn) in the kesterite system are known to be the root cause of the Voc deficit.16,25,26 These antisite defect clusters are favorably formed during the post-annealing process at a relatively low temperature in a short annealing period under a chalcogen atmosphere, which accelerates a random distribution of cations in the kesterite crystal lattice, thereby leading to cationic disordering.16,27–29
On the other hand, the causes for Voc-deficit characteristics in kesterite-based solar cells may result in a high recombination rate at hetero-interfaces. Various experimental approaches have been demonstrated to solve the Voc-deficit characteristics, such as (i) suppressing anti-site defects and related defect clusters by precisely controlling the properties of kesterite itself (i.e., controlling Cu/(Zn + Sn), Zn/Sn, and Se/(S + Se) compositional ratios and annealing conditions such as temperature, duration, heating rate, initial stage pressure, and additives),5,6,10,23,24,30 (ii) obtaining a favorable band alignment at the kesterite/buffer interface by introducing relatively wider Eg materials (i.e., (Cdx,Zn1−x)31, Zn(Ox,S1−x),32 InxSy,18 and (Znx,Sn1−x)O33) or by partial substitution with elements (i.e., Ge, Ag, and Cd)5,10,34–37 and controlling S/(S + Se) ratios in kesterite38 and (iii) passivation at the kesterite/buffer and/or Mo/kesterite interfaces using thin wider Eg and dielectric materials (i.e., Al2O3, TiO2, and SnO2)2,17,39 or introducing alkali elements (i.e., Na, K, and Li) occupying VCu defect sites. Engineering the kesterite surface (i.e., adjusting the compositional ratio26,40,41 or suppressing the defects and related defect clusters42) or interface between kesterite and buffer and/or Mo and kesterite10 is considered to be an effective strategy to further improve device performance. For example, the second phase (particularly, Cu2−xS compound) on kesterite thin film can supress by precisely adjusting the Zn/Sn ratio and finally supression of secondary phases on kesterite is strongly dependent on the device parameters and performances.43–45 This behavior may be related to the effective suppression of defect densities in kesterite thin films ranging from 1.1 to 1.39 Zn/Sn ratios.43–45 Despite this being an effective strategy to improve the Voc-deficit characteristics of kesterite-based solar cells, additional complicated and lengthy processes are required. Motivated by the above issues, such as the unavoidable formation of unexpected phases and the additional processes required for surface and interface engineering to effectively reduce the recombination rate, we hypothesized that the in situ formed materials (i.e., unexpected phases) on the kesterite surface during the synthesis process may be an effective strategy for revolutionizing the interface or surface engineering approach in kesterite-based solar cell technology.
In this work, we investigated and revealed surface and interface engineering to improve Voc-deficits and device performance for the first time via in situ formed ZnSe nanoparticles (NPs) on the CZTSe surface during the annealing of metallic stacked precursors in a Se vapor atmosphere. These desirable features of in situ formed ZnSe NPs on the CZTSe surface were confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) characterization. With our unworn surface and interface engineering strategy, we demonstrated an improved device efficiency of 9.5% and a Voc-deficit value of 0.580 V in the CZTSe solar cell with in situ formed ZnSe NPs as compared to that without them (7.86% and 0.635 V). By optimizing the solar cell fabricating process of all layers such as CdS, i-ZnO, and Al doped ZnO(AZO), we achieved a PCE of 10.49% and a Voc-deficit value of 0.539 V in the CZTSe solar cell device in situ formed ZnSe NPs on the CZTSe surface. Additionally, we suggested (i) the evaluation of interface characteristics in terms of band alignment and (ii) the possible reaction mechanism for the in situ formed ZnSe NPs on the CZTSe surface during the annealing process.
Experimental process
The kesterite CZTSe thin films are obtained by annealing a metallic precursor with different stacking orders under a Se vapor atmosphere (Experimental details are provided in the ESI†). Table S1† shows the sample IDs deposited under different metallic precursor conditions such as sample A-Cu/Sn/Zn/Mo, sample B-Cu/Sn/Zn/Sn/Cu/Mo, sample C-Zn/Cu/Sn/Zn/Mo, and sample D-Zn/Cu/Sn/Zn/Sn/Cu/Mo. The total metallic layer thickness of each sample was kept as 170 nm for Cu, 230 nm for Sn, and 180 nm for Zn. The process is described briefly as follows: (i) stacked metallic precursors with different stacking orders were prepared on a Mo back contact by sputtering; (ii) the stacked metallic precursor and Se powders were placed in a graphite box in a tube-type rapid thermal annealing system; (iii) a two-step annealing process was performed on metallic precursors, and the first dwelling stage is conducted at 350 °C for 5 min, and the second dwelling stage is performed at 490 °C for 10 min; (iv) the annealed films were naturally cooled to room temperature. The detailed experimental procedure is provided in the ESI.†
Results and discussion
Device performances with different stacking orders
To understand the effect of different stacking orders in the precursors on the CZTSe device performances, solar cells with a configuration of Al–Ni/AZO/i-ZnO/CdS/CZTSe/Mo/glass were fabricated. Fig. 1(a)–(d) show the device performances such as the efficiency (η), open circuit voltage (Voc), current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) of CZTSe solar cells with different stacking orders. The average and best device performance and diode parameters are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The device performance and diode parameters were strongly dependent on the stacking order. Interestingly, the η, Voc and FF device parameters of the CZTSe solar cell with Zn located on the top of the metallic stacking precursor including samples C and D were significantly improved compared to those with Cu located on the top of the metallic stacking precursor. This includes samples A and B except for Jsc. The average values of Jsc in samples B, C, and D are approximately 40 mA cm−2, whereas it is 37.16 mA cm−2 in sample A.

The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the best performing CZTSe solar cells with different metallic stacking orders are shown in Fig. S1(a) and (b),† respectively. Notably, Voc and FF are significantly enhanced in the CZTSe solar cell with Zn located on the top of the precursors (samples C and D) with enhancements of approximately 0.25 V and 5%, respectively. The best performing CZTSe solar cells are as follows: sample C (Voc = 0.377 V, Jsc = 41.12 mA cm−2, FF = 61.28%, and η = 9.5%) and sample D (Voc = 0.371 V, Jsc = 40.45 mA cm−2, FF = 63.23%, and η = 9.49%). Overall, the η of the CZTSe solar cells with Zn located on the top of the precursors (samples C and D) is improved by approximately 20% and 14% compared to those with Cu located on the top of the precursors (samples A and B), respectively. The diode parameters such as shunt resistance (Rsh), series resistance (Rs), ideality factor (A), and reverse saturation current density (J0) calculated from the J–V curves (Fig. S1(a)†) under light conditions of the best performing CZTSe solar cells showed similar behaviors with device performances with different stacking orders (Table 2). Similar to the device performances, the diode parameters of Rsh, A, and J0 in the CZTSe solar cells with Zn located on the top of the precursors (samples C and D) are significantly improved compared to those with Cu located on the top of the precursors (samples A and B) except for Rs. It is well known that the diode parameters, A and J0, in solar cell devices may be strongly related to the absorber quality and the recombination rates at the buffer/absorber and/or absorber/Mo back contact interfaces.46 This leads to Voc-deficit characteristics in the kesterite-based solar cell device. Our device performance results agree well with the aforementioned trends for diode parameters such as A and J0 and Voc-deficit characteristics in CZTSe solar cell devices as shown in Tables 1 and 2. The decreased values of A and J0 for samples C and D (Zn located on the top) compared with those of samples A and B (Cu located on the top of precursor samples) may be caused by the reduced defect generation near the space charge region, indicating improved junction quality in the samples C and D (Zn located on the top of the precursor samples).
The EQE spectra (Fig. S1(b)†) of CZTSe devices are over 85% in the visible region and then decrease in the longer wavelength region, which is attributed to the short carrier diffusion length and low minority charge carrier lifetime in the kesterite-based solar cell device.35 Similar values are observed between the integrated current densities from the EQE spectra (values in the inset of Fig. S1(b)†) and the measured Jsc. Interestingly, the EQE spectrum of the CZTSe device using sample A is slightly less than those of samples B, C, and D in the wavelength region from 550 to 1400 nm. As shown in previous studies, the improvement in the EQE spectrum in the long wavelength region may be ascribed to the following: (i) increased light irradiation by introducing wide Eg buffer materials (here it is not considered), (ii) reduced anti-site defect or related defect clusters in the kesterite, and (iii) a reduced recombination rate at the interfaces of buffer/kesterite and/or kesterite/Mo back contact. The band tail characteristics from the energy gaps between Eg measured dEQE/dλ and room temperature photoluminescence (RTPL) (Fig. S2† and Table 1) in CZTSe solar cell devices with different stacking orders were investigated. Fig. S2† shows EQE spectra vs. dEQE/dλ (black square), fitted dEQE/dλ (red line), and the fitted room temperature photoluminescence (RTPL) spectrum (blue circles) for the best performing CZTSe solar with different stacking orders. Detailed information such as the values of Eg and energy gaps between EQE and RTPL spectra is shown in Table 1. For the CZTSe solar cell devices, the positions of the RTPL peaks are shifted toward lower energies (red-shifting) with respect to the Eg determined from the EQE spectra as a result of the band tailing characteristic in the kesterite-based solar cell. The energy differences determined from the dEQE/dλ and fitted RTPL spectra in the CZTSe solar cell device from sample C are smaller than those of the other samples. The CZTSe solar cell devices with samples B and D show similar energy differences, whereas it is the largest value for sample A. The smaller energy difference in the solar cell device implies a reduced band tailing characteristic from anti-site defects or related defect clusters in the CZTSe absorber layer compared to other samples.9,16,27,28

Fig. 2 shows the room temperature capacitance–voltage (C–V) curves of the CZTSe solar cell devices with different stacking orders. The calculated values for the free charge carrier (NC–V) and depletion width (Wd) are shown in Table 2. The detailed calculation process of the NC–V and Wd values for the devices is provided in the ESI.† The NC–V and Wd values of the CZTSe solar cell devices based on samples A, B, C, and D are 8.27 × 1015 cm−3 and 171 nm, 6.13 × 1015 cm−3 and 159 nm, 4.94 × 1015 cm−3 and 191 nm, and 3.15 × 1015 cm−3 and 238 nm, respectively. The CZTSe solar cell device based on sample D shows the lowest NC–V and largest Wd values among all the solar cell devices. Reportedly Wd is the key parameter determining the charge separation and collection, which is mainly related to the recombination rate at the interface in multi-structured thin-film solar cell devices.47 A wider Wd for CZTSe solar cell devices based on sample A is effectively helpful for the collection of photogenerated charge carriers, especially, in the long wavelength region close to the band edge. It can result in a reduced interface recombination rate or tunneling recombination.47 Commonly, the CuZn antisite defects act as major p-type carrier sources in kesterite-based solar cell devices, which favorably bind with donor defects such as ZnCu and SnZn. They formed high densities of CuZn + ZnCu, CuZn + SnZn, and 2CuZn + SnZn defect clusters.26,48 These defect clusters may mainly result in band fluctuations or high recombination rates in the junction region at the kesterite/buffer interface.

Characterization of CZTSe thin films with different stacking orders
Interestingly, our CZTSe solar cells based on samples C and D showed improved device performances, diode parameters and junction quality compared to those based on samples A and B. To further reveal the origin of device performance variation with different stacking orders, we conducted structural, chemical, and morphological characterization of CZTSe thin films with different stacking orders using X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, Raman scattering, the element depth profile obtained by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM).
Fig. S4(a) and (b)† show the XRD patterns and Raman spectra of the CZTSe thin films with different stacking orders, respectively. All the annealed thin films show three strong diffraction peaks located near 27.2°, 45.2° and 53.5° corresponding to the (112), (220)/(204), and (312)/(116) planes, along with several minor peaks located near 15.6°, 17.5°, 22.1°, 28.4°, 35.3°, 36.2°, 42.9°, 48.7°, 63.9°, and 65.8° from the kesterite CZTSe structure matched well with the references of JCPDS 98-018-4474 and ICDD 97-018-4474.11,38
In the Raman spectra, all the annealed thin films with different stacking orders show two strong peaks located at 173 cm−1 and 194 cm−1, and weak peaks located near 230–250 cm−1, which correspond to the kesterite (173, 194, 234 and 244 cm−1) structure.4,11,38 Table S2† shows the compositional ratios of CZTSe thin films as a function of different stacking orders. The compositional ratios of CZTSe thin films were kept as a constant at 0.64 ± 0.01 for Cu/(Zn + Sn), 1.33 ± 0.02 for Cu/Sn, and 1.09 ± 0.03 for Zn/Sn, respectively. The structural and compositional properties of annealed CZTSe thin films are not significantly different regardless of the stacking order. Although we confirmed the presence of unexpected phases in the CZTSe thin films by XRD and Raman spectra characterization, the determination of their crystal structures seems to be complicated because of the complex nature of multi-element compositions in the kesterite system. To clearly reveal the formation of a minor portion of the unexpected phase in the CZTSe absorber, the XPS depth profile was employed to investigate the elemental uniformity in samples A and D (Fig. S5†). All element signals fluctuated slightly at the initial etching times up to 25 s regardless of the sample, which could be attributed to the insufficient sputtering yield in the initial etching process. Notably, there is no interfacial layer formation and localized deviation such as phase segregation and/or element aggregation in the composition within the CZTSe thin films in samples A and D. The Cu signals increased slightly when reaching the Mo back contact side in both samples, whereas the Sn and Zn signals were constant regardless of the depth in both samples.

Fig. 3 shows the surface and cross-sectional FE-SEM images of the CZTSe thin films with different stacking orders. All CZTSe thin films show similar bi-layered microstructures with micro-sized grains (∼2 to 4 μm) at the top and small grains accompanied by smaller voids at the bottom. Several voids were observed near the Mo back contact regions regardless of the stacking orders, which is a common issue for the relatively low performance of kesterite-based solar cells based on metallic precursors.11,38 Additionally, the formation of a thick interfacial MoSe2 layer (∼1.5 μm) between CZTSe and the Mo back contact is observed in all the annealed samples. Interestingly, bright colored nanosized particles on the CZTSe surface were observed in samples C and D, whereas as they were not present in samples A and B. From our empirical knowledge and previously published studies,11,38,49–52 we hypothesized that these brightly colored nanosized particles could be the ZnSe phase formed during the annealing process of samples with Zn located on the top of the metallic precursors.

To clearly prove the presence of nanosized ZnSe particles (hereafter ‘ZnSe NPs’) on the CZTSe surface, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and high resolution (HR)-TEM were performed. Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the STEM images and Zn and Se element maps of the CZTSe solar cell devices based on samples A and D, respectively. A sharp interface between the window, buffer and absorber layer can be clearly observed in sample A without the interfacial reactions of any phase. However, ZnSe NPs can be evidently seen on the CZTSe surface in sample D (white circle at overlap in Fig. 4(b)). Fig. 4(c) shows the TEM and HR-TEM images and selected electron area diffraction (SEAD) patterns of sample D, where the HR-TEM images (d-1 and e-1) and SEAD patterns (d-2 and e-2) were obtained from regions (d and e) marked in yellow in Fig. 4(c). Each HR-TEM image of sample D from (d) and (e) regions show clear lattice fringes having an interplanar spacing of 0.324 nm corresponding to the (002) planes of the hexagonal ZnSe structure.53 This crystal structure was further confirmed based on SEAD patterns indexed to the zone axis of the [010] direction for the hexagonal ZnSe structure in both regions (Fig. 4(d-2 and e-2)). Further discussion on the possible reaction mechanism for the in situ formation of ZnSe NPs on the CZTSe surface will be discussed in the next section.

Optimization of the device performance of the CZTSe solar cells with sample C
To improve the device performance of the CZTSe solar cell with sample C, we finely tuned the compositional ratio (it was not significantly changed from that of sample C). The J–V curve and EQE spectrum of the best performing CZTSe solar cells based on sample C after fine tuning the composition are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), respectively. Notably, Voc and FF are significantly enhanced in the CZTSe solar cell based on sample C after the optimization process with enhancements of approximately 48 mV and 2.8%, respectively. The champion device parameters of the CZTSe solar cell after the optimizing process are an η of 10.49%, Voc of 0.425 V, Jsc of 38.53 mA cm−2, and FF of 64.05% compared with the reference CZTSe solar cell without the optimization process (η: 9.5%, Voc: 0.377 V, Jsc: 41.12 mA cm−2, and FF: 61.28%). The EQE spectrum of the CZTSe solar cell device with champion efficiency is over 80% in the visible region and then decreased in the longer wavelength region. The EQE spectrum steadily decreased from 600 to 1300 nm, indicating that it may be attributed to the presence of smaller grains near the back contact side in the kesterite solar cell device, which may act as high recombination centers and finally lead to limited carrier collection in the longer wavelength region. FE-SEM images in Fig. 3 clearly show the bi-layered structure with large-sized grains in the top region and small-sized grains near the back contact region regardless of the stacking order of the precursors.

Band alignment for CZTSe/CdS, CZTSe/ZnSe NPs/CdS, and CZTSe/ZnSe layer/CdS samples
The aforementioned experimental results revealed some information as follows: (i) the bulk properties of the CZTSe thin films are not significantly different, (ii) the ZnSe NPs are observed at CZTSe surfaces with Zn located at the top of the precursors (samples C and D), and (iii) the CZTSe solar cell devices with ZnSe NPs on the surface of samples C and D show improved junction quality and device performance as compared to those in samples A and D. Previous studies demonstrated that the formation of interfacial NPs and/or layers affects the band alignment at each interface in the full device.54 Therefore, we investigated the band alignments such as the conduction band offset (CBO) and valence band offset (VBO) in the case of CZTSe/CdS, CZTSe/ZnSe NPs/CdS, and CZTSe/ZnSe layer/CdS, respectively, by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization. The detailed calculation processes of the CBO and VBO values for CZTSe/CdS, CZTSe/ZnSe NPs/CdS, and CZTSe/ZnSe layer/CdS are provided in the ESI.† Fig. S6† shows the valence band XPS spectra, and Cu, Cd, and Zn core levels for each sample. The energy value of the valence band maximum (EVBM) was estimated by a linear extrapolation approach (Fig. S6((a)–(c))†) in each sample. EVBM in bulk CZTSe, bulk CdS, bulk ZnSe, CZTSe/ZnSe NPs, and ZnSe layer/CdS is 0.34, 1.927, 1.44, 0.144, and 1.63 eV, respectively. Fig. S6(d)† shows the Cu 2p core level XPS spectra of the CZTSe, CZTSe/CdS, CZTSe/ZnSe NPs, CZTSe/ZnSe NPs/CdS, and CZTSe/ZnSe layer, respectively. The binding energy peaks of bulk CZTSe, CZTSe/CdS, CZTSe/ZnSe NPs, CZTSe/ZnSe NPs/CdS, and CZTSe/ZnSe layer/CdS are observed at 932.17, 932.26, 932.14, 931.99, and 932.63 eV, respectively, corresponding to the Cu 2p3/2 core level in CZTSe.38 On the other hand, binding energy peaks located at 405.5, 405.59, 405.55, and 405.5 eV are obtained from bulk CdS, CZTSe/CdS, and CZTSe/ZnSe NPs/CdS, and CZTSe/ZnSe layer/CdS, respectively, which correspond to the 3d5/2 core level in CdS. Additionally, the Zn 2p3/2 core levels are observed at 1022.26, 1022.38, and 1022.06 eV for bulk ZnSe, ZnSe layer/CdS, and CZTSe/ZnSe layer, respectively.38 The value of band bending (Vbb) for CZTSe/CdS, CZTSe/ZnSe NPs/CdS, ZnSe layer/CdS, and CZTSe/ZnSe layer is estimated to be −0.18, +0.1, −0.3, and −0.38 eV, respectively. The values of VBO for CZTSe/CdS, CZTSe/ZnSe nanoparticles/CdS, ZnSe layer/CdS, and CZTSe/ZnSe layer are estimated to be approximately −1.407, −1.186, +0.11, and +0.74 eV, respectively, from the Fermi level. Following the VBO calculation process, the values of CBO for CZTSe/CdS, CZTSe/ZnSe NPs/CdS, ZnSe layer/CdS, and CZTSe/ZnSe layer are positioned at +0.01, +0.26, −0.3, and 0.976 eV from the Fermi level. Table S3† shows the summarized and calculated parameters for each sample obtained from XPS characterization, and their optical band gap energies (Eg) were acquired using UV-vis spectrophotometry and EVBM, Vbb, VBO, and CBO, respectively. A schematic of the band alignment for CZTSe/CdS (Fig. 6(a)), CZTSe/ZnSe NPs/CdS (Fig. 6(b)), and CZTSe/ZnSe layer/CdS (Fig. 6(c)) is presented using the measured and calculated values shown in Table S3.†Fig. 6(a) shows the values of VBO (−1.407 eV) and CBO (+0.01) of the CZTSe/CdS sample revealing the so-called “spike-like” type (positive offset of CBO). The values of CBO at the CZTSe/CdS interface are reported to be in the range of −0.2 eV to 0.3 eV, which are found to be mainly dependent on the CdS buffer layer thickness, and the concentration of defects and related defect clusters in CZTSe.55 On the other hand, the CZTSe/ZnSe NPs/CdS sample has more favorable VBO (−1.186 eV) and CBO (+0.26 eV) than CZTSe/CdS. In contrast to the CZTSe/ZnSe NPs/CdS sample, the band alignment of ZnSe layer/CdS is evaluated to have a negative CBO value (−0.3 eV, the so-called cliff-like type) and it is also evaluated to have a highly positive value of CBO (+0.976 eV) at the CZTSe/ZnSe layer interface. This unique double band alignment of CZTSe/ZnSe layer/CdS may significantly worsen the device performance because (i) the highly spike-like band alignment acts as a barrier to injected electrons (i.e., majority carrier) at the CZTSe/ZnSe layer interface55 and (ii) the electrons lead to an interface recombination current between the holes at the ZnSe layer/CdS interface.55

Formation mechanism for in situ formed ZnSe NPs on the CZTSe surface
The reaction pathway from the metallic precursor (Cu/Sn/Zn/Mo) to the CZTSe film has been well established in the literature. However, the formation mechanism for the in situ formed ZnSe NPs on the CZTSe surface has not been explored. The diffusion rates of Cu and Zn are usually faster than that of Sn during the annealing process in the reaction from the metallic precursor to the kesterite phase.56 The literature suggests that the Zn atom is leached from the Cu–Zn alloy in the precursor, which is termed “dezincification”. They sequentially form the ZnSe phase under a Se vapor atmosphere at high Zn contents in the Cu–Zn alloy. This reaction phenomenon suggests that the Zn located at the top of the precursors easily gets a chance to form the ZnSe phase on the surface of the annealed thin film compared to that with Cu located at the top. Besides, the Zn atoms located at the bottom of the precursors can easily diffuse outward from the precursor thin film.
These alloys form Sn–Zn and Cu–Zn alloys and finally form relatively Zn-rich Cu–Zn alloys in the top region of the precursor during the annealing process.3,57,58 From the abovementioned formation mechanism of Zn-rich Cu–Zn regardless of the location of Zn in the precursor, the ZnSe phase in the annealed thin film with Zn located at the top of the precursors (samples C and D) is considered to be formed rapidly compared to that with Cu located at the top of the precursor (samples A and B). This suggests that the ZnSe phase on the CZTSe surface with Zn located at the top of the precursor (samples C and D) may have formed earlier (or at a lower temperature) than that with Cu located at the top of the precursor (samples A and B). Fig. 7(b) and (c) show the FE-SEM, back scattering electron images and electron probe micro-analyser (EPMA) mapping images of Cu, Zn, Sn, and Se elements in samples A and D, obtained during the annealing process as shown in Fig. 7(a). Zn- and Se-rich regions marked by red circles were obtained from each sample. The formation of binary phases such as Cu–Se-, Sn–Se-, and Zn–Se-based compounds as well as ternary phases such as Cu–Sn–Se-based compounds is detected. Interestingly, a high proportion of the formed ZnSe phases (marked with a red dotted line) on the surface is clearly observed in the annealed film with Zn located on the top of the metallic precursors (sample D) compared to that with Cu located on the top (sample A), suggesting the formation of a ZnSe phase with Zn located on the top of the metallic precursor at an earlier time or low temperature before the first dwelling time. Notably, when ZnSe phases are solely formed on the surface, they require higher energy to combine with binary phases such as Cu–Se and/or Sn–Se to form the CZTSe phase because the ZnSe phase has the highest stability among the possible binary phases. Finally, some of the ZnSe phase on the annealed film for sample D reacted with other binary selenides to form the CZTSe phase, whereas the rest of the ZnSe phase remained on the surface of the CZTSe film after the annealing process. In the case of the ZnSe phase on the surface of the annealed film for sample A, because ZnSe is not segregated from the film due to its later formation, ZnSe can react with other binary and/or ternary selenides to form the CZTSe phase so that the CZTSe film for sample A had no ZnSe NPs on the surface. Fig. S7† shows the surface FE-SEM images of CZTS thin films using Zn located on top of the metallic precursor with different thicknesses of the top Zn layer from 0 nm to 75 nm. The proportions of in situ formed ZnSe phases, which are relatively white coloured grains, are extended with increasing thickness of the Zn layer located on top of the metallic precursor. This clearly supports our hypothesis of the formation mechanism for in situ formed ZnSe NPs on the CZTSe surface.

Although the present work reveals interface and surface engineering for improved junction quality, diode parameters, and device performance for the first time via the unavoidable in situ formed ZnSe phase, the device performance is still less than that of the current best kesterite- and CIGS-based devices. Further work on (i) the optimization of fine tuning of the density and size of in situ formed ZnSe NPs on CZTSe surfaces, (ii) detailed investigation of the relationship between the in situ ZnSe NPs on the surface and defect states on the kesterite surface, and (iii) introducing alternative buffer or transparent conducting oxide materials in the fabrication process is needed to achieve high performance in kesterite-based solar cell devices.
Conclusions
In this work, we demonstrate the surface and interface engineering of kesterite-based solar cell devices for the first time via unavoidable unexpected phases (in situ formed ZnSe) on kesterite surfaces and achieved an improved device performance from 7.86% to 10.49%. Particularly, we demonstrated that the CZTSe solar cell device with ZnSe NPs on the CZTSe surface showed an improved junction quality and device performances compared to that without ZnSe NPs. Through extensive investigations, the unavoidable in situ formed ZnSe NPs in the CZTSe samples with 20 nm Zn located on top of the metallic precursor led to the preferred CZTSe surface and buffer/CZTSe interface characteristics. Finally, it resulted in improved junction quality, diode parameters, favorable band alignment and device performance for the first time via a facile process, i.e., changing the 20 nm Zn layer located on the top of the metallic stacking precursors. This utilization method of the in situ formed phase could provide an effective approach for the removal of the chemical etching process regarding the unexpected phase on the kesterite surface to achieve low-cost and highly efficient solar cell devices.
