    , Accepted 5th February 2016First published on 5th February 2016AbstractThe surface plasmonic effect of metal nanostructures is a promising method to boost the performance of optoelectronic devices such as solar cells and photodetectors. In this report, gold nanoparticles with surface plasmon resonance localized at about 530 nm were synthesized and integrated into graphene/methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) hybrid photodetectors. Compared with pristine graphene–CH3NH3PbI3 devices, a device with gold nanoparticles embedded has a doubly higher photo-responsivity as well as a faster photoresponse speed. The present devices adopt a unique configuration with gold nanoparticles physically separated from the light harvesting component, i.e., the perovskite layer by graphene. Advantages are revealed through a series of characterization techniques and analyses. First, thanks to the tiny thickness of graphene, the plasmonic effect of gold nanoparticles can effectively enhance the near-field of perovskite and thus facilitate light-harvesting. Second, the enhanced light-harvesting in perovskite happens very close to this interface where photo-induced carriers have relatively short paths to diffuse toward graphene, favoring a fast photo-response. This work demonstrates a feasible and inspiring strategy to improve the performance of photodetectors through the surface plasmonic effect of metallic nanostructures.
Introduction
Concerning high-performance photodetectors, devices based on hybrid materials comprising graphene and light sensitive materials have attracted vast attention. This hybrid material system can take advantage of both the high carrier mobility of graphene and the strong absorption coefficient of the light-sensitive materials thus simultaneously maximizing both light-harvesting and photo-induced carrier extraction. Based upon this concept, a variety of high-performing photodetectors have been reported such as ultraviolet photodetectors based on the graphene–ZnO hybrid with a photo-responsivity of 22.7 A W−1, infrared photodetectors based on graphene–lead sulfide quantum dot hybrids with a photo-responsivity up to 107 A W−1, and visible sensitive devices based on graphene–silicon hybrid structures.1–6 In terms of light sensitive materials, organic–inorganic hybrid metal–halide perovskite materials (OHMPs) such as CH3NH3PbI3 are under intense investigation for their applications in solar cells.7–9 The power conversion efficiency of solar cells based on metal–halide perovskites is now reaching ∼20%.10,11 This progress is mostly due to the excellent material properties including a high absorption efficiency, long exciton diffusion length and the absence of deep traps in the band structure.7–9,12 Obviously these properties also make perovskites good candidates for light sensitive materials in photodetectors. Since 2014, various photodetectors based on pure OHMPs have been reported.13–20 Through the deliberate design of either device configuration or material morphology, photodetectors with attractive features such as broad band, and flexible and fast response speed were demonstrated. Nevertheless, their photo-responsivities are relatively inferior, with the highest record of 340 A W−1.19 By integrating graphene into the OHMP photodetectors forming OHMP–graphene hybrid active layers, this value has been elevated up to 106 A W−1 in the visible range.21–23 These research studies suggest the important application potential of metal–halide perovskite materials in photodetectors. Despite these promising results, a further increase in the light harvesting efficiency of perovskite-based photodetectors is still necessary for devices to achieve a high performance without increasing their thickness and thus their favouring practical utility. To do so, harnessing of the plasmonic effect of nanostructures has been proven to be a feasible route.24–29 Here we demonstrate a significant responsivity enhancement in methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3)–graphene hybrid photodetectors through the insertion of gold nanoparticles (Au-NPs) into the devices. The surface plasmonic effect of Au-NPs increases the light absorption cross-sections of the surrounding perovskite material and thus leads to a higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) and responsivity.
Results and discussion
Au-NPs with a diameter of ∼40 nm were synthesized according to a sodium citrate reduction method.30 To integrate Au-NPs into perovskite CH3NH3PbI3–graphene (denoted as P–G hereinafter) hybrid devices, Au-NPs were bonded on the Si/SiO2 substrates through a self-assembled monolayer of 3-aminopropyl-triethoxysilane (APTES).31Fig. 1a shows a representative SEM image of a Au-NP-coated Si/SiO2 substrate. It can be clearly seen that one layer of Au-NPs densely covers the substrate. Despite the formation of some small clusters, most particles are isolated from each other contributing to a globally uniform coverage on the substrate. The optical absorption spectra of a thin film of Au-NPs coated on glass using the same bonding method used in phototransistor devices and Au-NPs in solution are shown in Fig. 1b. The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peaks from the solution sample and the thin film sample are located at the same wavelength of about 530 nm, confirming the uniform dispersion of the majority of Au-NPs on substrates. Fig. 1c is the atomic-force microscopy (AFM) image of the Au-NP-coated glass. Fig. 1d is the Scanning Near-Field Optical Microscopy (SNOM) image corresponding to the sample area shown in Fig. 1c. The magnitude of the fluorescence signal probes the extent of the near-field enhancement around Au-NPs (see the ESI†).32,33 Despite the fact that it was not possible to resolve an individual Au-NP, from Fig. 1d one can clearly observe the near-field enhancement surrounding Au-NP clusters. In some cases where a large Au-NP cluster was formed, a dark spot was visible in the middle of such a cluster in the fluorescence image due to the reduced amount of laser transmitted through the sample.

The phototransistor structure based on the CH3NH3PbI3–graphene–Au-NP hybrid system (denoted as P–G–Au hereinafter) is illustrated in Fig. 2a. On a Si/SiO2 substrate with a Au source and drain electrodes, Au-NPs were bonded through a self-assembled monolayer of APTES as described above. Graphene was then transferred onto such a Au-NP-coated substrate, followed by the deposition of the perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) thin film by spin-coating of a stock CH3NH3PbI3 solution. The detailed experimental methods are in the ESI.†Fig. 1e is the Raman spectrum of graphene on a Si/SiO2 substrate, showing its single layer characteristics.34 The formation of CH3NH3PbI3 crystals was verified by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (XRD spectrum shown in Fig. 1f).35 The morphology of the perovskite layer is in the form of isolated islands with a maximal island height of about 400 nm (Fig. S1†). With such a device configuration, the interface between graphene and CH3NH3PbI3 is intact after the integration of Au-NPs, and the CH3NH3PbI3 layer is thin enough to be penetrated by the light used in this report.36,37 For comparison, the phototransistors based on graphene only and P–G were also fabricated.

(b–d) Transfer characteristics of the graphene-only, CH3NH3PbI3–graphene (P–G), and CH3NH3PbI3–graphene–Au-NP (P–G–Au) devices, respectively. These characteristics were measured under a VDS bias of 0.1 V and under an illumination of a wavelength of 532 nm at different light intensities (listed in (b)). 
The photo-response of graphene only, P–G and P–G–Au phototransistors was characterized systematically under the illumination of a laser (wavelength = 532 nm) operated under a series of power densities. Fig. 2b–d are their transfer characteristics with VDS = 0.1 V under light with a variable illumination intensity. Due to the non-continuous or island-like morphology, the layers of Au NPs and CH3NH3PbI3 were determined to be nonconductive (Fig. S2†). The transfer characteristics measured thus originate from the charge transport in graphene. In Fig. 2b, the graphene-only device shows an undetectable response to the strongest illumination. This is due to the limited light absorption coefficient of graphene at this wavelength as well as the fast carrier recombination in pristine single layer graphene.38,39Fig. 2c shows that a similar graphene device with CH3NH3PbI3 deposited above becomes strongly p-doped. This is consistent with a previous report and such p-doping can be understood by considering the electronic energy level alignment between the two materials.22 The current in the hole wing of the P–G hybrid device increases under illumination with increasing light illumination, well coincident with the negative gating effect model:1,22 CH3NH3PbI3 is first excited by incident photons and thus generates holes and electrons. As the Fermi level of graphene lies between the conduction band and valence band of CH3NH3PbI3, both photo-induced electrons and holes can be transferred from CH3NH3PbI3 to graphene. The transfer of electrons is slower than that of holes, so that net electrons in CH3NH3PbI3 will induce positive carriers in graphene through capacitive coupling and thus increase the current of the transistor in the hole wing.1,4Fig. 2d shows the representative transfer curve of P–G–Au devices. Despite the fact that the Au-NPs at the dielectric–graphene interface may perturb the charge transport channel to some extent, the transfer characteristics from P–G–Au devices strongly resemble those from P–G devices. Notably we observed a slightly decreased on/off ratio but a significantly larger photo-response in P–G–Au devices compared with P–G devices.
To quantitatively evaluate the response improvement, the responsivities (R) and external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the P–G–Au device and the P–G device at a VG of 0 V were respectively calculated through: (1)and (2)where, Iph is the photocurrent, P the light intensity, E the applied electrical field, μ the carrier mobility, S the cross section area, nph the photo-induced carrier density, h the Planck constant, υ the light frequency, and q the elemental charge.4,40 The calculated EQR and R were plotted along different illumination intensities and are shown in Fig. 3a. Under the same illumination intensity, the P–G–Au device shows a responsivity and EQE which are almost two times higher than those for the P–G device. The field-effect hole mobility in P–G and P–G–Au devices was calculated to be 0.15 and 0.14 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. From eqn (1), as they have the same device structure and were measured under the same conditions, this responsivity increment in the P–G–Au device should originate from the increased photo-induced carriers. In principle, when the carrier injection/extraction conditions are identical, the increase of EQE represents the outcome of more carrier generation or/and less recombination. Four possible mechanisms may be responsible for the improvement according to the literature: (i) the junction between Au-NPs and CH3NH3PbI3 can facilitate the separation of excitons and the extraction of carriers; (ii) the surface of Au-NPs can trap minority carriers or depress the carrier recombination in CH3NH3PbI3; (iii) hot carriers generated in Au-NPs can transfer into graphene and thus increase the photocurrent; (iv) the near-field enhancement on the surface of Au-NPs due to the plasmonic effect can increase the light harvesting in CH3NH3PbI3.26–28 In the current work, Au-NPs are not directly in contact with CH3NH3PbI3 (there is graphene between these two materials), we therefore consider that the first and the second mechanism are unlikely the dominating processes in our devices. Concerning the third mechanism, in order for the plasmonically generated hot carrier (e.g. hot electrons) to play a role in the device performance, the Au-NPs should be in contact with materials that can effectively remove the counter-carriers (e.g. holes). In the current work, the isolated Au-NPs are in contact with graphene and the insulating SiO2 gate dielectric. We therefore believe that the third mechanism is also unlikely to play a significant role in the device performance observed. In reality, the transfer characteristics of a device composed only of graphene and Au-NPs show a negligible response even to the strongest illumination (Fig. S3†) which is similar to that observed in the graphene-only devices. We attribute the enhanced light absorption in the perovskite layer due to the plasmonic effect of Au-NPs as the main mechanism contributing to the observed increased photo-responsivity and EQE in the P–G–Au device.29 This point will be further correlated in the following analysis.

Data were extracted from the transfer characteristics of the respective devices at a zero gate voltage as shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). The dependences of responsivities on the light intensity are fitted with power functions with fitting parameters listed in (a). (b) Schematic of generation, diffusion and transfer of photo-induced carriers in the perovskite layer with and without the influence of gold nanoparticles. (c) Responsivities vs. VDS under different light intensities. (d) Responsivities vs. light intensity at different VDS biases. The dependences of responsivities on the light intensity are fitted with power functions with fitting parameters listed in (d). 
The photo-responsivity-light intensity R ∝ P dependence can be fitted with power functions as shown in Fig. 3a. This relationship can be analysed using the model for carrier recombination in photovoltaic devices.41,42 One of the reasons for the reduced responsivity along illumination intensity is the increased probability of carrier recombination as the carrier density increases. As illustrated in Fig. 3b, in the P–G–Au device, most photo-induced carriers are generated around the interface between graphene and perovskite (P–G interface) due to the near-field enhancement of Au-NPs. As most of these carriers are not far from the P–G interface, during their transport to graphene, the probability for them to encounter a recombination event is smaller than those carriers generated far from this interface. This contributes to the observed slower decline of responsivity along increasing light intensity in P–G–Au devices (Fig. 3a). These two devices were further characterized as photoconductors by fixing VG to 0 V. The R ∝ VDS dependence under variable illumination intensities is exhibited in Fig. 3c. The photo-responsivity of the P–G–Au device is two times larger than that of the P–G device across all illumination intensity ranges and under different VDS (from 0 to 10 V). The responsivity values under the smallest illumination intensity (1.4 × 10−5 W cm−2) and under three different VDS biases (0.1, 5 and 10 V) are listed in Table 1. The maximum photo-responsivity value observed reaches up to 2 × 103 A W−1 with VDS = 10 V. The responsivity value is not extraordinarily high, but the point of this report is a reliable enhancement effect instead of a record value. The performances of some photodetectors based on graphene and OHMP hybrids in the literature studies are listed in Table 2 for comparison. Note that, first, the responsivity value will be larger under a weaker light illumination. Second, such a responsivity value depends on the carrier mobility of graphene. A higher responsivity can be expected if graphene of an improved quality (e.g. in terms of defects, grain boundaries, and uniformity) is applied. The R ∝ P dependences at different VDS are extracted and plotted in Fig. 3d. These curves can be fitted well by power functions and the fitting results are shown in Fig. 3d. The R ∝ P relationships are near identical on comparing Fig. 3a and d, suggesting that the plasmonic enhanced responsivity is not dependent on the lateral source–drain field.

The photo-switching characteristics of these two photodetectors were determined under a periodic on–off illumination (wavelength = 532 nm, intensity = 1.82 mW cm−2) and a VDS of 0.1 V without a gate bias (Fig. 4a). Both the P–G–Au and P–G devices exhibit a stable performance with cyclic photocurrents following light signals. The photocurrent of the P–G–Au device is significantly higher than that of the P–G device, coherent with the steady device characteristics mentioned above. A representative one cycle response is shown in Fig. 4b. The response time is defined as the time used by the photocurrent to increase from null to 80% of the saturation level.1 It can be observed that the P–G–Au device responds slightly faster than the P–G device. This can be well explained by the model illustrated in Fig. 3b. In the P–G–Au device, the existence of Au-NPs leads to more photo-induced carriers generated in the perovskite layer near the P–G interface. The time for these carriers to diffuse into graphene is shorter than that for carriers generated far from the P–G interface, thus leading to the observed faster operation in the P–G–Au device compared with the P–G device. It is worth noting that a slow response speed is an inherent pitfall in graphene-light absorber hybrid photodetectors.4 In these devices, photo-induced carriers have to travel across a long distance before being injected into graphene and are then extracted out from electrodes. Enhancing carrier generation in a light absorber near graphene by the surface plasmonic effect of metal nanoparticles is thus a feasible way to accelerate the photo-response speed in these type of photodetectors. The stability of photodetectors is an important figure of merit toward practical applications. Most components of the device presented here are stable for months except for CH3NH3PbI3, which will decompose in several hours under high humidity ambient conditions.43 The search for solutions to promote the stability of devices based on CH3NH3PbI3 as well as similar OHMP compounds is a challenging and currently ongoing topic.44,45 Device encapsulation may partially alleviate the stability problem.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the responsivities of perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3)–graphene hybrid photodetectors under a visible illumination of a wavelength of 532 nm were enhanced doubly by integrating gold nanoparticles with a diameter of ∼40 nm underneath the graphene. This enhancement can be attributed to the improved light harvesting in the perovskite layer due to the surface plasmonic effect of gold nanoparticles. In addition, as the improved light harvesting in the perovskite layer mainly happens in regions close to the perovskite–graphene interface, the carrier extraction efficiency and photodetector operation speed are improved compared to devices without gold nanoparticles. This work demonstrates a functional example as well as a promising strategy to improve the performance of graphene-based photodetectors in multiple aspects simultaneously.
