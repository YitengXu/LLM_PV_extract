    , Accepted 15th July 2018First published on 17th July 2018AbstractDiketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and isoindigo (ISO) moieties have been widely studied in organic optoelectronic materials, while they have been rarely explored as electron transporting materials in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). In this paper, two organic molecules, tetraphenylethylene-diketopyrrolopyrrole (TPE-DPP4) and tetraphenylethylene-isoindigo (TPE-ISO4), were synthesized and successfully used in inverted PSCs. Cyclic voltammetry measurement revealed the matched energy levels of the TPE-based interlayers with perovskite materials. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra, time-resolved PL decay results and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) indicate the enhanced electron extraction and electron-transporting ability after introducing the TPE-DPP4/TPE-ISO4-based interlayer in PSCs. As a result, devices with TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4 interlayers exhibit high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 18.44% and 18.19%, respectively, and notably, the FF values are as high as 80%. The standard device without an interlayer was also measured, showing an inferior PCE of 16.87%. Therefore, TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4 can work as efficient interfacial materials for improving electron transfer, and finally for enhancing the photovoltaic performance in inverted PSCs. As far as we know, this is the first report on the DPP/ISO-based interfacial layer in perovskite solar cells. The results in this work also demonstrate the great potential of DPP or ISO-based n-type materials for application in PSCs.
Introduction
Over the past decade, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials (CH3NH3PbX3, where X = Cl, Br, I) have attracted great attention in photovoltaic devices because of their intrinsic merits, such as a broad absorption spectrum, small exciton binding energy, long charge diffusion lengths and solution processability.1–7 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite-based solar cells have increased to over 22% in less than ten years.8 In most of the state-of-the-art perovskite solar cell (PSC) devices, metal oxides such as TiO2, ZnO, SnO2 and BaSnO3 tend to be used for electron transport purposes in conventional n–i–p type PSCs.9–12 However, high-temperature sintering of metal oxides hampers the development of PSCs for low-cost and flexible applications.13–15 In 2013, Guo and co-workers reported inverted p–i–n type PSCs, where poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) were used as the hole and electron transporting materials, respectively.16 There are many advantages of inverted PSCs, for example, low temperature processing, facile preparation, reduced hysteresis and the potential to be fabricated into flexible devices, making them powerful candidates for scale-up commercialization in the future.
It has been reported that a Lewis base containing N and S atoms can effectively passivate the surface trap states and grain boundaries of perovskite film.17,18 In this regard, pyridine, amino modified fullerenes, amino-functionalized graphene, and amino silane were deposited on top of the perovskite layer to eliminate defects.19–22 For the first time, Huang and Zhan et al. introduced a π-conjugated Lewis base, IDIC, between the perovskite layer and the C60 electron transporting layer (ETL). Through the formation of Lewis adducts, the trap states were passivated by IDIC, and the PCE was enhanced.23 Later, Zhan's group designed the INIC series substituted by a different number of F atoms as the interfacial layer, and the INIC-2F based device exhibited a champion efficiency of 19.3%.24 Recently, Yang et al. reported the ITCPTC series as interlayers, and a high efficiency of 18.75% was obtained.25 However, the chemical structures for constructing the interfacial layer for PSCs are still limited and sometimes the structures are not easy to synthesize.26,27 Therefore, it is necessary to enrich the structural diversity and to develop new interfacial materials that are easy to synthesize and possess excellent charge transport properties for application in perovskite solar cells.
Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and isoindigo (ISO) have often been used to construct n-type semiconductors because of their electron-withdrawing ability and rigid π-conjugation plane. DPP and ISO-based materials have been extensively studied in organic solar cells (OSCs) and organic field effect transistors (OFETs).26–30 Considering their electronic properties and the low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, they may also find applications in perovskite solar cells. However, to date, DPP or ISO-based materials have been rarely reported in perovskite solar cells, despite their extensive development in other optoelectronic fields. Herein, we designed and synthesized two new molecules based on DPP and ISO (TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4), and we used them as the interfacial materials in inverted PSCs. In the newly designed compounds, tetraphenylethylene (TPE) was chosen as the core structure, because it is easy to synthesize and the “3D” structure could prevent the molecules from severe aggregation, and DPP or ISO moieties substituted by 2-ethylhexyl side chains were used as the periphery arms (Fig. 1). Inverted PSCs were fabricated by introducing TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4 as the interlayer between the perovskite active layer and the C60 ETL. The interlayer worked to extract electrons from the perovskite layer as well as to assist electron transfer. It turned out that the device using the TPE-DPP4 interlayer exhibited a champion efficiency of 18.44%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.05 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.03 mA cm−2 and a high fill factor (FF) of 80%, slightly higher than that of the device based on TPE-ISO4 (PCE = 18.19%, Voc = 1.036 V, Jsc = 21.86 mA cm−2, and FF = 80%). The standard device without the interlayers was also studied, exhibiting an inferior PCE of 16.87%, with a Voc of 1.015 V, a Jsc of 21.39 mA cm−2 and a FF of 78%. The results suggest that by rational design, DPP and ISO also show great promise in PSCs to enhance the electron extraction and electron transporting ability.

Results and discussion
As depicted in Fig. 2a, the UV-vis absorption spectra of TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4 were measured in THF (3 μM), and the spectra for the two compounds are quite different from each other. For TPE-DPP4, there are three absorption bands in the visible region, located at 385, 555 and 584 nm, respectively. The maximum absorption at 584 nm can be ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) band. TPE-ISO4 also exhibits three peaks in the range from 300 to 700 nm. The peak at around 400 nm is attributed to the π–π* transition of the conjugated aromatic segments, and the weak shoulder band at 500 nm could be attributed to the ICT band. The onset absorption of TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4 is 625 and 628 nm, respectively, corresponding to a band gap (Eg) of 1.98 and 1.97 eV.

The electrochemical properties of TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4 were examined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in 0.1 M dichloromethane solution using TBAPF6 as the electrolyte. The curves were recorded using the SCE as the reference electrode, and they were calibrated by the ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple, with a scanning rate of 100 mV s−1. The LUMO energy levels of TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4 were calculated to be −3.89 and −3.92 eV, respectively, according to the equation of ELUMO = −(5.10 + (Eonset.red vs.Fc+/Fc)). The HOMO energy levels of TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4 were calculated to be −5.87 and −5.89 eV, using the equation of EHOMO = ELUMO − Eg. The LUMO energy levels of both molecules match well with the conduction band (CB) of perovskite, thus making them beneficial for extracting electrons from the perovskite layer. Electron mobility was measured by the SCLC (space-charge-limited current) method. The electron mobility of 1.92 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TPE-DPP4 and 1.56 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TPE-ISO4 suggests the decent mobility of the two molecules. Besides this, the thermal stability of TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4 was measured under a nitrogen atmosphere. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4 exhibit a degradation temperature (Td) of 455 °C and 358 °C, with reference to a 5% weight loss, suggesting the good thermal stability of the two compounds. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to study the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the two compounds. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4 exhibit Tg values of 116 °C and 96 °C, as recorded from the second heating–cooling cycle. Therefore, TPE-DPP4 shows a higher thermal stability than TPE-ISO4.
To further study the electron extraction ability of TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4, steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra were recorded. As shown in Fig. 3a, the as-cast perovskite film exhibits strong PL emission at 770 nm. After depositing the C60 layer on top of the perovskite film, the PL intensity declines by 85%. A further decrease is observed when TPE-DPP4 or TPE-ISO4 is introduced between the perovskite layer and the C60 layer, indicating the enhanced electron extraction after spin-coating the interlayer. The fitted PL lifetime for the neat perovskite film is about 234.89 ns, while the decay times for the perovskite/TPE-DPP4/C60, perovskite/TPE-ISO4/C60 and perovskite/C60 films are about 7.52 ns, 17.12 ns and 23.40 ns, respectively. The PL decay results are consistent with the steady-state fluorescence changes. Based on these results, we can see clearly that both TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4 can effectively improve the electron extraction and electron transporting ability in inverted PSCs.

The inverted PSCs were fabricated in the following configuration: ITO/P3CT-Na/perovskite/TPE-ISO4 or TPE-DPP4/C60/BCP/Ag. Fig. S4 (ESI†) shows the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the device, and perovskite with large crystals is clearly observed. Initially, the performance of standard PSCs without the interlayers was studied, and a PCE of 16.87% was observed, with a Jsc of 21.39 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.015 V and a FF of 78%. Then, PSCs containing different interlayers were studied. The interlayer thickness was adjusted by varying the concentration of the TPE-DPP4 or TPE-ISO4 solution. For TPE-DPP4, 2 mg mL−1 is the optimized condition, resulting in a Jsc of 22.03 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.05 V, a high FF of 80%, and a PCE of 18.44%. Further increasing the concentration to 5 mg mL−1, however, leads to a decreased Jsc and FF due to the higher series resistance in the thicker TPE-DPP4 film. With respect to TPE-ISO4, the optimal concentration is also 2 mg mL−1, contributing to a Jsc of 21.86 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.036 V, a FF of 80%, and a PCE of 18.19%. Similar to TPE-DPP4, when the concentration of TPE-ISO4 increases to 5 mg mL−1, both Jsc and FF decline significantly. According to the steady state and time-resolved PL spectra, the deposition of the interlayer can efficiently enhance the charge extraction ability, which is consistent with the higher Jsc values measured in devices containing the interlayer. In addition, the decent electron mobility of the TPE-based interlayer also facilitates electron transport. It was reported in Zhan's pioneering work that the Voc of their device increased from 1.03 to 1.11 V after depositing a π-conjugated Lewis base between the perovskite and ETL.23 Similarly, in our work, both DPP and ISO are π-conjugated organic moieties containing S or N atoms, which can be regarded as the π-conjugated Lewis base. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to elucidate this point (Fig. S5, ESI†). The shift in the Pb 4f peak before and after the deposition of TPE-DPP4 or TPE-ISO4 clearly suggests the interaction between perovskite and the interlayer. For the perovskite film coated with TPE-DPP4, the existence of S and N at the surface can be observed by signals from S 2s at 227.6 eV, S 2p at 163.6 eV and N at 399.4 eV, respectively. Meanwhile, Fig. S5c (ESI†) demonstrates the existence of N (399.5 eV) by analyzing the perovskite film covered by TPE-ISO4. Therefore, the incorporation of the TPE-based interlayer should also be advantageous for trap passivation, as stated in the literature, and the Voc of the device with the interlayer exhibited a slight enhancement in comparison with the control device without an interlayer. All of these factors may account for the elevated photovoltaic performance in inverted PSCs containing the TPE-DPP4/TPP-ISO4 interlayer (Table 1).

Hysteresis in J–V curves measured by scanning from different directions was investigated in the inverted PSCs. In Fig. 4c, the control device with the C60 electron transporting layer exhibited little hysteresis, while in the presence of the interlayer, hysteresis is further eliminated. This might be associated with the more efficient charge transport as well as trap passivation after incorporating the interlayer.31Fig. 4d compares the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the optimized PSCs. The devices with interlayers have slightly higher EQE responses than that of the control device in the range from 400 to 750 nm. The integrated short-circuit current density values obtained from the EQE spectrum are 21.10, 20.88 and 20.27 mA cm−2 for the TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4-based devices and the control device, respectively, which are in good accordance with the values obtained from the J–V curves.

Fig. 5a shows the Jsc and PCE measured at the maximum power output point of the champion devices with the TPE-DPP4 or TPE-ISO4 interlayer, respectively. A steady state PCE of 18.33% and a Jsc of 20.84 mA cm−2 could be clearly observed for the TPE-DPP4-based device. The device with TPE-ISO4 exhibits a stabilized PCE of 18.01%, and a Jsc of 20.38 mA cm−2, confirming the reliable high performance of the devices studied. In addition, the statistics of PCE distribution for the TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4-based devices were recorded, and the results are presented in Fig. 5b. It was observed that over 70% of the TPE-ISO4-based devices show a PCE above 17.6%, and 85% of the TPE-DPP4-based devices exhibit a PCE exceeding 17.7%. The results further confirm the high performances and good reproducibility of these devices using the DPP and ISO-based interlayer.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is an effective technique to investigate the interfacial charge transport properties in PSCs. Fig. S7 (ESI†) compares the EIS with or without the interlayers under dark conditions at 0.9 V forward bias. The inset shows the equivalent circuit model, consisting of the series resistance (Rs), the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the capacitance. There are orders of magnitude differences between Rs and Rct. The Rs values were about 3.26 Ω cm2 and 3.03 Ω cm2 for the TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4-based PSCs, respectively. Moreover, Rs for the control device without an interlayer was 4.01 Ω cm2. Therefore, interfacial modification causes a reduced contact resistance, leading to a decreased Rs. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the device only deposited with the C60 ETL exhibits the largest semicircle. The device with TPE-ISO4 has a moderate semicircle, while the TPE-DPP4 based device exhibits the smallest semicircle. A smaller semicircle in the high frequency region corresponds to a lower Rct, thus contributing to the efficient charge transport at the interface. It can be observed clearly from the above results that Rct can be apparently lowered by the addition of TPE-DPP4 or TPE-ISO4. The device modified with TPE-DPP4 exhibits the smallest semicircle, superior to that of the TPE-ISO4 based device, resulting in the highest Jsc of 22.03 mA cm−2. In addition, the AFM images of perovskite, perovskite/TPE-DPP4 and perovskite/TPE-ISO4 were obtained (Fig. S8, ESI†). The RMS (root-mean-square roughness) was 12.7 nm for perovskite/TPE-DPP4 and 15.3 nm for perovskite/TPE-ISO4, much lower than the value of 24.6 nm for the perovskite film. Therefore, the deposition of interlayers ensures a better interfacial contact in the inverted PSCs, leading to an improved charge transfer process and finally the enhanced performance.
The stability of PSCs in air is an important factor with respect to application. Thus, the performances of PSCs modified with different interlayers under 25–30% humidity in air were investigated, and the control device was also studied for comparison. As shown in Fig. 6, the PCE of the control device declines to 70% of the initial efficiency, while the devices modified with TPE-DPP4 or TPE-ISO4 retain over 80% of the initial PCE, indicating the relatively higher air stability of PSCs containing the interlayers. The difference in stability should be ascribed to the introduction of the interlayer. TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4 are hydrophobic organic molecules, which may function as a waterproof layer for the perovskite layer beneath. To confirm this point, the contact angle of a water droplet was measured on different substrates. As shown in Fig. 6, the neat perovskite film has a contact angle of 44.5°. After depositing TPE-DPP4 or TPE-ISO4 on the perovskite layer, the contact angle increases to 93.01° and 95.03°, respectively. Therefore, the interlayer can effectively protect the perovskite layer underneath from moisture invasion. On the other hand, the trap passivation of the electron extraction materials for perovskite is favourable for the increased stability as well, as we have discussed above.

Conclusions
In summary, we designed and synthesized two simple TPE-based molecules, TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4, and successfully applied them in inverted PSCs. Although DPP and ISO have been widely investigated in OPVs and OFETs, they are seldom used in perovskite solar cells. Both compounds are easily synthesized and purified, and their energy levels can be easily adjusted by structure modification. The modification of the TPE-DPP4 or TPE-ISO4 interlayer contributes to a suppressed charge transfer resistance, and also gives rise to the enhanced electron extraction and electron transporting ability. All of these results demonstrate a positive effect on the improvement of the power conversion efficiency. The devices incorporating TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4 exhibit a remarkable PCE of 18.44% and 18.19%, respectively, superior to that of the control device without any interlayer (16.87%). Notably, a high FF of 80% is obtained for the TPE-DPP4 and TPE-ISO4 based devices. This work confirms that DPP and ISO-based small molecules are promising interfacial materials for highly efficient inverted PSCs. In addition, this work enriches the present study on n-type π-conjugated interfacial materials in inverted perovskite solar cells.
