    , Accepted 14th October 2017First published on 16th October 2017AbstractComprehensive studies were carried out to understand the origin of the current hysteresis effects in highly efficient C60-CH3NH3PbI3(MAPbI3) heterojunction solar cells, using atomic-force microscopy, transmittance spectra, photoluminescence spectra, X-ray diffraction patterns and a femtosecond time-resolved pump–probe technique. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of C60-MAPbI3 solar cells can be increased to 18.23% by eliminating the point (lattice) defects in the MAPbI3 thin film which is fabricated by using the one-step spin-coating method with toluene washing treatment. The experimental results show that the point defects and surface defects of the MAPbI3 thin films can be minimized by varying the dropping time of the washing solvent. The point defects (surface defects) can be reduced with an (a) increase (decrease) in the dropping time, resulting in an optimized dropping time for obtaining the defect-minimized MAPbI3 thin film deposited on top of the C60 thin film. Consequently, the formation of the defect-minimized MAPbI3 thin film allows for high-efficiency MAPbI3 solar cells.
Introduction
Organic lead trihalide perovskite thin-film based solar cells have been receiving a lot of attention as they have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 20%.1–4 The photogenerated electron–hole pairs (excitons) in the perovskite thin films can be effectively converted into electrical power due to the small exciton binding energy,5–7 long carrier diffusion length,8–10 high Hall mobility11,12 and low Urbach energy13,14 of the perovskite thin films. In addition, a high photovoltaic voltage of over 1.2 V can be produced due to the low voltage loss across the perovskite thin film.15 Up to now, the highest PCE of perovskite solar cells is 22.1% which is obtained by using a regular-type device structure: metal/HTL/perovskite/ELT/TCO/glass, where the HTL, ETL and TCE denote the hole-transport layer, electron-transport layer and the transparent conducting electrode, respectively. Anatase TiO2 materials,16–18 ZnO thin films19–21 and thermally evaporated C60 thin films22–24 have been widely used as the ETL while the lithium salt doped spiro-OMeTAD thin films have been widely used as the HTL. The perovskite thin films can be fabricated on substrates using the one-step spin-coating method with toluene washing treatment,25–27 the two-step spin-coating method with an inter-diffusion process28–30 and the thermal evaporation method.31–33 In order to confirm that the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells is reliable, the investigation of the current hysteresis effects34–37 plays an important role in understanding the highly efficient perovskite solar cells. The current hysteresis effects in current–voltage curves have been experimentally demonstrated that the halide ions can be electrically driven from the perovskite thin film to the ETL/perovskite (HTL/perovskite) interface through the defects in the perovskite thin film.38 However, the formation of the surface and volume defects in the perovskite thin films and the correlation between the defects in the perovskite thin film and the current hysteresis effects are not completely understood. The aim of this study is to understand the defect-induced current hysteresis effects and thereby minimizing the defects in the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) thin film for realizing the high-efficiency MAPbI3 solar cells.
Experiments
A 20 nm-thick C60 thin film was fabricated on top of the ITO/glass substrate using thermal evaporation at a rate of 0.01–0.02 nm s−1 in a high vacuum environment (1.5 × 10−6 torr). Then, the roughened ITO surface14 was completely covered with a 20 nm-thick C60 thin film. 598 mg PbI2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9995%) and 196 mg MAI powders were dissolved in a 1000 μL DMF/DMSO (9:1 v/v) solvent mixture which was used as the CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution. MAI (Lumtec, 98.5%) was purified from a mixed solvent of ethanol and diethyl ether to obtain the pure MAI crystals. The one-step spin-coating method with toluene washing treatment was used to fabricate the CH3NH3PbI3 thin film on top of the C60/ITO/glass. The function of toluene is to balance the competition between the nucleation and crystal growth during the formation of a CH3NH3PbI3 thin film.27 The spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (80 mg/1 mL) solution with additives containing 16 μL Li-TFSI/acetonitrile and 28.5 μL TBP was spin coated on top of the CH3NH3PbI3/C60/ITO/glass as the electron blocking layer. The 100 nm-thick silver film was thermally evaporated onto the sample to act as the anode electrode. The active area (0.5 cm × 0.2 cm) of the solar cell was defined by using a metallic mask during silver evaporation. The resultant device was composed of silver/spiro-OMeTAD/CH3NH3PbI3/C60/ITO/glass. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of solar cells were obtained using a source-measurement unit (Keithley 2400). The optical intensity of the simulated sunlight was calibrated using a reference silicon solar cell (Oriel, 91150 V) with a band pass filter (KG-5) to have an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The surface morphologies of the CN3NH3PbI3/glass samples were determined using a contact-mode atomic-force microscope. The transmittance spectra of the CN3NH3PbI3/glass samples were recorded using a broadband spectrometer. The photoluminescence spectra of the CN3NH3PbI3/glass samples were recorded using a microscope-based spectrometer. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the CN3NH3PbI3/glass samples were recorded using a theta–2theta mode. The spectral-temporal four-wave mixing characteristics of the CH3NH3PbI3/glass samples were determined using a home-made femtosecond pump–pump–probe spectrometer.
Results and discussion
The photovoltaic performance of the MAPbI3 solar cells is illustrated in Table 1. The highest PCE of 18.23% was achieved by varying the dropping time of the washing solvent used during the spin-coating process for the fabrication of the MAPbI3 thin film. To understand the photovoltaic performance illustrated in Table 1, the current hysteresis effects in the current density–voltage curves of the MAPbI3 solar cells are shown in Fig. 1. There is a lowest current hysteresis in the J–V curves (see Fig. 1(b)) when toluene is dropped at 10 s, which confirmed that the high PCE of 18.23% is reliable. The current hysteresis behaviors in the J–V curves are related to the dropping time of the washing solvent used in the fabrication process of the MAPbI3 thin film, which means that the dropping time (DT) of the washing solvent influences the formation of defects in the MAPbI3 thin films.

Fig. 2 presents the atomic-force microscopy (AFM) images of the MAPbI3 thin films. There is a large peak-to-valley (P–V) height of 462 nm in the MAPbI3 thin film when the DT of the washing solvent is 16 s, which results in a roughened MAPbI3 thin film. The P–V height of 462 nm is larger than the thickness of the spiro-OMeTAD thin film (125 nm), which results in a poor coverage of the spiro-OMeTAD thin film on the MAPbI3 thin film and thereby decreases the photovoltaic performance. When the P–V heights are smaller than the thickness of the spiro-OMeTAD thin film, the fill factors (FFs) of the C60-MAPbI3 heterojunction solar cells are higher than 60%, which indicates that the smooth contacts at the C60/MAPbI3 and MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD interfaces were formed. Consequently, the current hysteresis effects in the J–V curves were mainly dominated by the defects in the MAPbI3 thin films. Fig. 3(a) presents the transmittance spectra of the MAPbI3/glass samples. The interference ripples in the near-infrared wavelength region can be used to calculate the refractive index of the MAPbI3 thin films by n = (λVλP)/[4d(λV − λP)], where λV is the wavelength of the valley, λP is the wavelength of the peak, and d is the thickness of the MAPbI3 thin film. After the calculations, the refractive index of the MAPbI3 thin films can be obtained as shown in Fig. 3(b). The refractive index of the MAPbI3 thin films increases from 2.20 to 2.28 with a decrease in the DT of the washing solvent from 13 s to 7 s without a significant change in the surface morphology of the MAPbI3 thin films (see Fig. 2(a)–(c)). It means that the change in the refractive index (density) of the MAPbI3 thin films originates from the change in the interior properties of the MAPbI3 thin films. When the DT of the washing solvent is 16 s, the low refractive index of the MAPbI3 thin film is due to the porous structure.

To investigate the defects in the MAPbI3 thin films, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra (see Fig. 4) of the MAPbI3/glass samples were recorded under an optical excitation at a wavelength of 405 nm. At the wavelength of 405 nm, the incident photons are almost absorbed by the MAPbI3 thin films. Therefore, the PL intensity in Fig. 4(a) can be used to evaluate the exciton dynamics in the MAPbI3 thin films. The PL intensity increases with an increase in the DT of the washing solvent from 7 s to 10 s. With an increase in the DT from 10 s to 16 s, the value of the PL peak intensity decreases from 98 to 65. The trend of the PL intensities indicates that there are two factors that can influence the PL intensity (exciton dynamics) of the MAPbI3 thin films. In the normalized PL spectra, the shoulder in the PL curves, which corresponds to the emission from the trap states (surface defects),38 increases with an increase in the DT of the washing solvent from 7 s to 16 s. It indicates that the surface defect in the MAPbI3 thin film plays a role in trapping the excitons. To investigate the interior properties, the X-ray diffraction patterns (see Fig. 5(a)) of the MAPbI3/glass samples were recorded. The strong X-ray diffractions indicate that the crystalline MAPbI3 thin films can be formed. The XRD intensity of the main diffraction peak (see Fig. 5(b)) increases with an increase in the DT of the washing solvent, which indicates that the different interior properties of the MAPbI3 thin films are formed. The trend of the refractive index in Fig. 3(b) and the trend of the XRD intensity in Fig. 5(b) indicate that the dense MAPbI3 thin film doesn't efficiently diffract the X-ray photons. It can be due to the formation of the point defects in the MAPbI3 thin film, which can be used to understand that the increase in the PL intensity (see Fig. 4(a)) is due to the reduction in the point defects when the DT of the washing solvent increases from 7 s to 10 s.

To confirm the formation of the point defects in the MAPbI3 thin films, a femtosecond time-resolved pump–probe technique39 was used to evaluate the point defects in the MAPbI3 thin films.40,41Fig. 6(a) presents the spectral-temporal four-wave mixing (FWM) characteristics of the MAPbI3/glass sample when the DT of the washing solvent is 10 s. The trend of the FWM intensity (see Fig. 6(b)) is inversely proportional to the trend of the XRD intensity (see Fig. 5(b)), which indicates that the density of the point defects in the MAPbI3 thin film decreases with an increase in the DT of the washing solvent from 7 s to 16 s.

The DT of the washing solvent strongly influences the morphological, structural, optical and excitonic properties of the resultant MAPbI3 thin film, which dominates the photovoltaic performance and current hysteresis effects of the solar cells. The experimental results show that there is a trade-off between the formation of surface defects and volume defects in the MAPbI3 thin films which are fabricated using a one-step spin-coating method with a washing solvent treatment process. Therefore, it seems that the current hysteresis effect is the characteristic of the regular-type MAPbI3 solar cells. When the DT of the washing solvent is smaller (larger) than 10 s, the formation of volume defects (surface defects) is possibly due to the generation of excessive nucleation sites (the roughened surface). In other words, the surface defects of the MAPbI3 thin film are not passivated by the spiro-OMeTAD capping layer. It is predicted that the PCE of the regular-type C60-MAPbI3 heterojunction solar cells can be improved by deactivating the surface defects of the MAPbI3 thin films.38
Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated the role played by the dropping time (DT) of the washing solvent used during the fabrication of the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite thin film in regular-type perovskite solar cells. The DT of the washing solvent influences the current hysteresis behaviours of the perovskite solar cells, which originate from the formation of surface defects and point (lattice) defects in the MAPbI3 thin films. The outstanding performance of C60-MAPbI3 solar cells relies on the formation of a defect-minimized MAPbI3 thin film.
