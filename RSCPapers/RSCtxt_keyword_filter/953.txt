    , Accepted 1st July 2016First published on 4th July 2016AbstractIn this article we report on a semitransparent polymer solar cell (STPSC) with polymer: fullerene blends sandwiched between a bottom one-dimensional photonic crystal (1DPC) and a top solution-processed highly conductive PEDOT:PSS electrode for light harvesting. The photoelectric parameters of STPSCs are characterized by the measurements of double-face optical transmittance, reflectance, absorption, J–V, EQE, IQE, average visible transmittance, and CIE in conjunction with those of the theoretical calculations based on transfer matrix simulation. The results reveal that the theoretical short-circuit current density (JSC) of 1DPC-STPSC is not sensitive to the active layer thickness due to the relatively weaker microcavity effect compared to that of the conventional opaque PSCs, making the large-area manufacturing process easier. However, it shows a stronger microcavity effect compared to the non-microcavity STPSCs, which is advantageous to light absorption in active blends in the strong absorption band while maintaining visible light transmission in the weak absorption band. The power conversion efficiency of 5.20% and JSC of 12.25 mA cm−2 increased by 37% and 38% respectively when compared with those of the STPSCs without using 1DPC, which is the highest value ever reported for an inverted STPSC with a low-cost highly conductive PEDOT:PSS layer as the light-incident side.
Introduction
Recently, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been intensively studied because they possess potential advantages such as low-cost and large-area fabrication via roll-to-roll (R2R) coating technology.1–6 Lightweight, flexibility, semi-transparency, sensitivity to low light intensity or non-direct sunlight, and room-temperature solution-processing make PSCs highly suitable for building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems.4 Single junction PSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 10% will further boost this system development in the future.6–9 As we know, active layers, consisting of a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) of the conjugated polymer and fullerene derivative, are typically thinner than 100 nm, which allows nearly half the visible light to pass through the active layer. Thus it is favourable to employ semitransparent polymer solar cells (STPSCs) as the building envelope, such as on a window or roof for power generation while keeping the visible light transmission. Several STPSC studies with the different device structures have focused on constructing BIPV solar cells, e.g. a weak microcavity structure adopting very thin metals10,11 or metal oxides,12–14 and a strong microcavity structure with one-dimensional photonic crystals (1DPCs).3,15–18 Among these reports, 1DPCs have drawn great attention due to their photon tunability and color selectivity. For example, Lunt et al. reported that the incorporation of near-infrared 1DPCs leads to an increase in the PCE from 1.3% to 1.7%, while maintaining a high visible-transparency of 55%.15 Shen et al. obtained a PCE of 2.46% and an average transmittance of 40% within the photonic passband of 380–580 nm by using 1DPCs with the array structure of WO3/LiF.18 Moreover, Martorell et al. utilized simple non-periodic one-dimensional structures to increase the degree of freedom of broadband photonic crystals, leading to 30% visible light transmission and 5.6% PCE.3 However, in these scientific studies the photonic multilayer structures were fabricated by thermal evaporation of low-refractive-index and high-refractive-index materials in vacuum on top of the solution-processed active layers. This is harmful to the active layers and can cause irreparable damage due to the penetration of high-energy hot metal atoms, which will deteriorate the device stability.19 An alternative route to protect the active layer is to change the sequence of deposition of the 1DPC multilayer structure and the active layer. That is to say the 1DPC structure should be manufactured in vacuum prior to the solution-processed active layer, which will protect the active layer from damage and consequently enhance the stability of STPSCs. Pastorelli et al. reported bottom multilayer dielectric STPSCs with a device structure of 1DPC/Au/active layer/Ag; however, the thermally evaporated Ag top electrode makes this architecture incompatible with R2R production.20 On the other hand, the good electrical properties of transparent electrodes in STPSCs are strongly required for charge carrier collection. There are many types of transparent conductive electrodes used in STPSCs, such as indium tin oxide (ITO),12,13,21 silver metal,10,11,20 carbon nanotubes,22 graphene,23,24 silver nanowires,25,26 poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS),27,28etc. Compared to other transparent conductive materials, PEDOT:PSS shows good transparent and conductive properties with low cost and easy processing, making it more compatible with R2R manufacturing. For instance, Tang et al. achieved a PCE of 6.70% by improving cathodes with a polymer interlayer in reversed PSCs using a PEDOT:PSS layer as the top anode.27 Peng et al. reported a dual ternary system for highly efficient ITO-free PSCs with a PCE of 7.65%.28
In this work, we report a novel R2R compatible STPSC based on a bottom 1DPC and a top solution-processed PEDOT:PSS layer to take full advantage of the donor polymer absorption while maintaining the whole device semitransparent characteristics. The optimized PCE of 5.20% and short-circuit current density (JSC) of 12.25 mA cm−2 increased by 37% and 38% respectively can be realized via selecting PEDOT:PSS as the light-incident side with an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 24%, when compared with those of STPSCs without using 1DPC with an AVT of 38%. This design is favorable to maximize the device performance while retaining the device visible light transmission property to a great extent. To the best of our knowledge, it is the highest value ever reported for 1DPC-based STPSCs with a solution-processed PEDOT:PSS layer as the top semitransparent electrode. With the help of optical simulation, including photon absorption rate, electric field intensity profile, transmission, reflection and internal quantum efficiency (IQE), the reason for trade-off between PCE and transmission is systematically discussed. In contrast to the reported devices with excellent IQE approaching 100%1 for opaque PSCs and 90%13 for STPSCs, high IQE above 90% is also obtained for our STPSCs, indicating efficient carrier generation and transport as well as low exciton/charge recombination in solution-processed PEDOT:PSS-based STPSCs. Moreover, the diversity of device color coordinates suggests that this type of STPSC is suitable to be used in colorful surface applications such as skylights and roofing.
Results and discussion
The STPSC device architecture used in this work is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a, while chemical structures of the water-/alcohol-soluble conjugated polymer poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) and electron donor polymer thieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7) used in the study are shown in Fig. 1b. PFN is used as the ITO surface modifier to lower the work function and eliminate the space charge build-up and charge recombination.29 An ohmic contact can be formed at the interface of PFN/active layer, which is advantageous to the photogenerated charge-carrier collection.30 A blend of PTB7:[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) (1:1.5 by weight) is used as the photoactive layer with PC71BM as the electron acceptor. A highly conductive PEDOT:PSS layer with a transmittance of 90% is used as the incident layer and anode, which can form ohmic hole contacts with many bulk-heterojunction active layers.31 The SEM cross-section image of the bottom 1DPC is also shown in Fig. 1c. In order to compare STPSCs with 1DPC, STPSCs without using 1DPC and opaque devices with PEDOT:PSS as the top transparent anode were also fabricated. Three different types of solar cells were studied, which were measured in different illumination directions:

Fig. 2 shows the experimental and simulated transmittance curves of the 1DPC/ITO substrate and the absorption of the pure PTB7 polymer. Transmittance data demonstrate that the 1DPC alters the transmittance spectra of glass/ITO. The theoretical transmittance based on transfer matrix modeling (TMM)32 is well in accordance with the experimental transmittance, illuminating the validity of the calculation method. The photonic band gap (530–720 nm) of 1DPC/ITO primely matches the absorption curve of pure PTB7, which is of benefit to the donor absorption influenced by the light interference in STPSCs.

The photon absorption rate profiles (300–1000 nm) of the two types of STPSCs from top and bottom illumination are presented in Fig. 3. The horizontal axis indicates the position of each layer relative to the first light-incident layer. The calculated integrated photon flux density in Type 1 active layers is 6.33 × 1020 m−2 s−1 and 7.02 × 1020 m−2 s−1, which were illuminated through the PEDOT:PSS side or ITO side, respectively. When 1DPC is adopted, the integrated photon flux density in the active layer is increased by 27.2% for the Type 2a device (8.05 × 1020 m−2 s−1) due to the strong microcavity effect compared to the Type 1a device. However, the integrated photon flux density in the Type 2b device is decreased to 2.86 × 1020 m−2 s−1 due to the limited photon incidence into the active layer. In addition, there is a parasitic photon absorption rate in the PEDOT:PSS layer for two types of STPSCs, which will be discussed in the next part.

For exploring the exciton generation rate (G(λ)) at different wavelengths, Fig. 4 shows the equal-scale contour plot of exciton generation rate in the active layer in conjunction with other layers under top or bottom illumination on the assumption that excitons are generated possibly over the entire inner layers. It can be observed that excitons are efficiently generated in the Type 2a device due to the stronger microcavity effect compared to Type 1 devices, which would result in the enhancement of photocurrent. The wavelength dependent interference effect in the Type 2a device implies that the photon which is not absorbed in the active layer in the first path can be reflected by 1DPC and may be absorbed in the second or subsequent paths, leading to the increment of JSC.12 However, exciton loss in the PEDOT:PSS layer is also apparent for the Type 2a device due to the high electric field intensity inside the PEDOT:PSS layer. The weak G(λ) in the Type 2b cell is consistent with the photon absorption rate profiles in Fig. 3d due to the light incident limitation. In addition, we can clearly see the slight power dissipation in the PFN interlayer in Fig. 4a and b, which is mainly centralized in the blue wavelength region.

The theoretical maximum photocurrent (Jmax) can be obtained by integrating the photons generated in active layers assuming that IQE is 100%. Fig. 5a shows the theoretical Jmax as a function of the active layer thickness for three types of devices. The Jmax of STPSCs is very different from that of opaque solar cells. One distinct maximum around 100 nm appears in the Jmax curve for the Type 3 device, which is related to strong interference phenomena occurring in opaque thin film stacks. However, the photocurrent is insensitive to the variation of the active layer thickness for both Type 1 and Type 2 STPSCs, except for a weak maximum around 60 nm for the Type 2a device due to the relatively stronger microcavity effect because the higher reflectivity of the 1DPC increases the formation of standing waves compared to the transparent ITO metal oxide layer. In fact, the insensitivity of the photocurrent to the active layer thickness makes STPSCs more suitable for robust processing because it is difficult to fabricate uniform thin films in large-area R2R manufacturing. Fig. 5b shows the J–V characteristics of the three types of devices. The detailed device parameters are shown in Table 1. The Type 2a STPSC shows a JSC of 12.25 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 5.20%, which were increased by 38% and 37% respectively compared to the Type 1a STPSC without using 1DPC. Due to the strongest microcavity effect, the Type 3c cell shows the best device performance with a PCE of 6.52%. Fig. 5c presents the corresponding EQE measurement. The calculated JSC from EQE curves is in good agreement with the measured JSC with less than 3% error. The low transmittance characteristic of 1DPC from 530 to 720 nm makes the EQE of the Type 2a cell form pronounced peaks and valleys.

Since the thickness of PEDOT:PSS influences the optical transmittance and sheet resistance, we use a figure of merit (FoM) to evaluate the optoelectrical property of the PEDOT:PSS electrode, where higher values imply higher transmittance at a given sheet resistance. Typically, a FoM greater than 35 is the minimum benchmark of commercial viability of transparent conductors. For example, this constitutes a sheet resistance ≤ 100 Ω □−1 and transparency ≥ 90% at 550 nm. The FoM can be calculated according to the following equation:33–35 (1)where Rsheet is the sheet resistance and T is the transmittance at λ = 550 nm. For the 100 nm-thick PEDOT:PSS film generally used with an Rsheet of 143 Ω □−1, transmission of 92% and a conductivity of 700 S cm−1, the FoM is 32.27,28 While for 135 nm PEDOT:PSS film with an Rsheet of 77 Ω □−1, transmission of 90% and a conductivity of 962 S cm−1, the FoM is 45, which is higher than the FoM minimum benchmark of 35. Fig. S1† shows the theoretical relationship between the different thicknesses of PEDOT:PSS and calculated Jmax for the 100 nm-thick active layer of Type 2a devices in conjunction with the experimental JSC. The experimental highest JSC obtained is located at 135 nm and then JSC decreases linearly with the increase of thickness of PEDOT:PSS because of the absorption of PEDOT:PSS. That is why an optimum 135 nm-thick PEDOT:PSS is used in the above calculation and experiment with a fine FoM of 45.
For semitransparent solar cells, a certain transmittance is required for solar power window applications and it should not be considered as a photon loss mechanism. Fig. 6a and b show the total experimental and simulated device transmittance spectra of the respective STPSCs. For Type 2a and Type 2b STPSCs with 1DPC, the transmittance spectrum shape is similar to that of the single 1DPC due to the transparency management through the 1DPC reflector. However, below the wavelength of 500 nm, there is smaller transmittance intensity for Type 2 STPSCs compared to the single 1DPC (35% vs. 65%). Above the wavelength of 500 nm, the transmittance intensity becomes much lower for Type 2 devices compared to the single 1DPC (1% vs. 8%). Such high to low transmittance intensity in the visible region means that color selectivity can be achieved, allowing a diversity of window applications to meet different needs. The simulated transmittance based on TMM is quite consistent with the actual experimental transmittance, so the transmittance and color characteristics of STPSCs can be predicted. For the Type 1 STPSC without 1DPC, the flat transmittance ranges from 20% to 40% between 350 nm and 730 nm. The concave near 680 nm in the Type 1 device transmittance spectrum should originate from the light absorption of the PTB7 polymer. The AVT of the semitransparent devices in the visible region (380–780 nm) is presented in Table 1. The AVT of Type 2 STPSCs based on 1DPC is lower than that of Type 1 cells, but a decent transmittance (∼24%) can still be obtained from these cells. The experimental reflectance of different types of cells is in line with the simulated reflectance, as shown in Fig. 6c and d. The Type 2b STPSC shows the highest reflectance from 530 to 720 nm, while the Type 2a cell from 530 to 720 nm and the Type 3 opaque cell from 330 to 600 nm present moderate reflectance.

CIE 1931 is the initial color coordinates (x, y), which firstly defines the quantitative relationship between the physical pure color in the visible electromagnetic spectrum and physiological perceived color in the human color vision. Fig. 7 displays the CIE 1931 color space and the color coordinates of each device illuminated by the AM1.5G illumination light source. Due to the uniform transmittance over the entire visible spectrum, the Type 1a and Type 1b devices can hardly alter the CIE of the AM1.5G light source. However, a small reflectance intensity difference between Type 1a and Type 1b devices over the entire visible spectrum results in moderate CIE variation. For Type 2 devices, the transmission and reflection of devices show cyan and yellow colors, respectively. The concrete color coordinates of the STPSCs combined with the simulated CIE from human eye XYZ tristimulus values are shown in Table 2. From the data, we conclude that Type 1 and Type 2 devices are highly suitable for neutral and colorful BIPV applications, respectively.

The absorption of Type 3 and Type 2a devices shows higher values than other devices, which can result in higher PCEs (Fig. S2a and b†). The absorption shapes of different devices are in accordance with their EQE spectra (Fig. 5c). Where absorption is higher, EQE is also higher at the corresponding wavelength. Based on the absorption of devices plotted in Fig. S2,† we are able to undertake an attempt to understand the electro-optical property of the STPSCs through the IQE. The IQE should be quantified through the following expression according to the previous method.13,36 (2)where Aactive(λ) is the active layer absorption obtained by 1 − R(λ) − T(λ) − Aparasitic(λ). The parasitic absorption (Aparasitic) is calculated with TMM, which is related to the PEDOT:PSS, ITO, 1DPC and PFN absorptions (Fig. 3 and 4). The average IQE value from 380 to 780 nm for the Type 1a device approaches 92%, which should be the same for the Type 2a device.37,38 The high IQE implies that almost all photons absorbed in the active layer are dissociated into charge carriers and photocurrent is effectively generated.39 The reflectance, transmittance and layer-specific absorptions of Type 1a and Type 2a STPSCs are shown in Fig. 8. Surprisingly, the detrimental average Aparasitic of the 1DPC-based Type 2a device (12.6%) is not increased and is even a little lower than that of the Type 1a device (13.3%) in the full wavelength range (380–780 nm). Furthermore, the active layer absorption Aactive(λ) can be divided into two parts: effective absorption (Aeffective, i.e. EQE), and non-effective absorption (Anon-effective) due to geminate and non-geminate recombination. Aeffective(λ) = IQE × Aactive(λ)(3) Anon-effective(λ) = [1 − IQE(λ)] × Aactive(λ)(4)
 Fig. 8  Reflectance, transmittance and layer-specific absorptions of the Type 1a (a) and Type 2a (b) devices with light incidence from the PEDOT:PSS layer. 
The ratio of average Aactive to reflectance, transmittance and layer-specific absorptions for the Type 2a device is 46% in the photonic band gap region (530–720 nm), which is much higher than that of the Type 1a device (33%). The average Aeffective values of the Type 2a device within/outside the 1DPC photonic band gap (530–720 nm) are increased by 29% and 20% compared to those of the Type 1a device, respectively. The tiny fractional variation of Anon-effective for both Type 1a and 2a devices confirms the high IQE above 90% of our devices. These results are similar to those with high IQEs reported by other groups,1,13 meaning that high JSC and PCE come from the efficient photon-to-charge conversion process.
Conclusions
Semitransparent polymer solar cells with polymer: fullerene blends sandwiched between a bottom one-dimensional photonic crystal and a top solution-processed highly conductive PEDOT:PSS layer have been successfully fabricated. The 1DPC-based STPSCs exhibit significantly enhanced PCE under AM1.5G light irradiation due to the stronger microcavity effect compared to the STPSCs without using 1DPC. Manipulation of the photon propagation inside the cells can be successfully achieved with the use of 1DPC. The integrated photon flux density in the active layer is increased by 27.2% for 1DPC-based STPSCs compared to that without 1DPC. The detrimental average Aparasitic of 1DPC-based STPSCs is comparable and even lower than that of STPSCs without 1DPC in the full wavelength range (380–780 nm), indicating the effectiveness of photon absorption in the active layer with 1DPC as the reflector. Moreover, with the help of the theoretical optical simulation, transmission, reflection and absorption were systematically investigated, giving a design guidance for semitransparent 1DPC-based devices. Furthermore, the low-cost and highly conductive PEDOT:PSS as the transparent anode is in line with the R2R fabrication and has a good FoM value of 45, higher than the commercial minimum benchmark of 35. In addition, the insensitivity of the photocurrent to the active layer thickness also makes this type of 1DPC-based STPSCs more suitable for robust processing in large-area manufacturing. The CIE color coordinates suggest that 1DPC-based devices are highly suitable for colorful BIPV application. A high photocurrent of 12.25 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 5.20% with a fairly good AVT of 24% are achieved for 1DPC-based STPSCs, which is the best semitransparent PSC performance with PEDOT:PSS as the light incident anode reported to date. However, the results also reveal that there is still much room for improvement of the transparent device performance due to the parasitic absorption and low FF. The exploration of this work provides valuable solutions for high efficiency 1DPC-based STPSCs with a solution-processed highly conductive transparent electrode.
Experimental section
Materials
PTB7 and PC71BM were purchased from 1-Material Inc. and Solenne Inc., respectively. PFN was synthesized in our laboratory. The highly conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PEDOT:PSS PH1000) was obtained from H.C. Starck Clevios GmbH.
Device fabrication
Inverted STPSCs were fabricated as follows. 1DPC consists of multiple layers of alternative high refractive index TiO2 and low refractive index SiO2 by sputtering. The 1DPC/ITO coated glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, detergent, de-ionized water and isopropanol in turn. The PFN thin layer was firstly spun on top of glass/1DPC/ITO from a methanol solution at 2000 rpm for 60 s, forming a thin 10 nm-thick interlayer. A 100 nm thick PTB7:PC71BM active layer (25 mg mL−1) in CB solvent with 3 vol% DIO was spin-coated onto the PFN layer at 800 rpm for 60 s. Finally, PEDOT:PSS solution mixed with 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and 0.5% surfactant (Zonyl FS 30) was spin-coated on top of the active layer at 1000 rpm for 60 s, followed by annealing at 60 °C for 60 s. The cell was then transferred to a glove box to be encapsulated with photo-sensitive glue and a glass lid. The effective active area was 4 mm2 determined by using a patterned mask.
Measurements and characterization
Optical constants (n and k) were measured using a Horiba Jobin Yvon AUTO SE ellipsometer. The thickness was measured using a surface profiler (XP-2, Ambios). The current J–V characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination of an AM1.5G solar simulator with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Sun 2000 Solar Simulator, Abet Technologies, Inc.). Transmittance and reflectance were performed with different illumination directions recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2550 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The EQE data were recorded with a QE-R test system from Enli Technology Company (Taiwan). Optical calculations are based on transfer matrix modelling. The electric field intensity inside the stack is attributed to the unpolarised light coming from the sun, which is the arithmetical average between s and p polarization. Color coordinates of STPSCs were tested using a TOPCON Luminance Colorimeter BM-7 under AM1.5G illumination.
