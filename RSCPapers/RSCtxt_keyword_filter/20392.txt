1. Introduction
Fibers are a symbol of human civilization, which have played a vital role in the long history of human development.1 In ancient times, our ancestors used animal skins and bark to protect their bodies from the cold. However, until the 19th century, fibers have been limited to natural fibers such as cotton, silk and wool.2 Also, the applications of natural fibers have been restricted by their inherent properties. Natural fibers, such as cotton, kapok, and polar bear wool, have good warmth retention due to their cavity structure, but these fibers have their own shortcomings. The thermal insulation performance and compression elasticity of cotton fibers become poor after a period of use. The hollow degree of kapok fibers is very high, and thus their thermal insulation performance is better than that of cotton, but their compressive performance is poor, and they easily absorb moisture and mold. Having a special microstructure and excellent thermal insulating ability, polar bear hair has provided huge inspiration for the design of biomimetic thermal insulating and energy collection material. Thus, a variety of man-made fibers have been produced for thermal management. Rayon, as the first man-made fiber, opened up a new pathway to modern life in clothing, home decoration, energy, etc.3 Since the 19th century, unprecedented technological revolution has taken place in many fields, which has brought tremendous progress in the chemical fiber industry. During this period, many functional and smart fibers were designed and developed, such as bionic-fibers,4,5 ultra-fine fibers,6,7 profiled fibers and conductive fibers.8–10
Currently, hollow polyester fibers are the main type of commercial hollow fibers, which have a hollow rate as high as 20%. Their hollow structure can hold more air inside the yarn and fabric, giving a much better insulation performance than cotton and ordinary polyester, and slightly better than wool. The above-mentioned hollow fibers mainly use the characteristic of the lower thermal conductivity of air to avoid heat loss. The insulation effect mainly depends on the thickness and density of the fabric fabricated using fibers, although external compression and moisture also affect its insulation effect. However, if the external environment is too cold or too hot, the insulation effect will be limited. Due to the passivity of heat regulation, traditional hollow fibers are called passive insulation fibers. Phase change temperature-regulating fibers are a new type of functional product developed by combining phase change materials with fiber manufacturing technology.11–13 When the ambient temperature increases, the phase change material contained in the fiber changes from solid to liquid, absorbing heat and storing it in the fiber. When the ambient temperature drops, the phase change material changes from liquid to solid, releasing the stored heat, maintaining the body surface temperature and keeping the body in a comfortable state.14,15
In addition to thermal management, smart garments and wearable electronics are also integrated into every corner of daily life, making our lives more convenient and intelligent, which also put forward higher requirements on fibers.16–18 On the one hand, fibers are required to have excellent wearing comfort, such as air and moisture permeability, sweat absorption and temperature regulation. On the other hand, fibers need to be able to convert and store energy to power smart garments and wearable electronics. Compared with traditional energy storage and conversion devices, fiber-based devices have several obvious advantages. (i) The diameter of devices usually ranges from micrometers to millimeters, which makes them smaller in size and lighter in weight. (ii) Their outstanding flexibility endows them with wearable comfortability and stable performance under mechanical deformation. (iii) Fibers can be further woven or knitted into deformable textiles with breathability and excellent wearability.19,20 Due to aforementioned unique properties, fiber-based energy conversion and storage devices have attracted remarkable attention. The various novel prototypes and advancements over the past two decades are briefly summarized in chronological order and shown in Fig. 1. A coaxial fiber-based dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) was constructed by coating photoactive materials onto a metal wire in 2002.21 Following a similar approach, fiber-based polymer solar cells were fabricated by replacing the metal wire with optical fibers in 2007.22 To enhance the power conversion efficiency, fiber-based perovskite solar cells were produced in 2014.23 As another type of energy harvesting device, fiber-based piezoelectric and triboelectric nanogenerators were developed in 2008 and 2014, respectively.24,25 In addition to energy conversion devices, fiber-based energy storage devices were also developed. For example, a fiber-based supercapacitor (SC) was proposed by twisting two CNT fibers coated with PVA/H3PO4 gel electrolyte in 2003.26 The fiber-based lithium-ion battery emerged in 2013, which was much later than SCs due to its complex preparation process.27 Then, other related fiber-based metal ion batteries, such as zinc–air batteries,28 lithium–sulfur batteries,29 lithium–air batteries30 and aluminium–air batteries31 were all successfully prepared in turn. Although energy conversion and storage parts are independent, it is still meaningful to implement two functions in a single fiber, which can improve the overall energy conversion and storage efficiency. A self-powered device was realized by integrating a DSC and SC on a titanium wire deposited with titanium dioxide in 2012.32 After more than ten years of rapid development, fiber-based energy related devices have begun to become the mainstream direction in many fields such as materials science, energy and environment, physics, and engineering.33

This review aims to systematically summarize the functional fibers and fiber-based energy storage and conversion devices designed for smart garments. Firstly, we introduce fiber devices with the energy conversion function, focusing on nanogenerators and solar cells. Then, fiber-based energy storage devices are reviewed, including supercapacitors and batteries. Finally, some important challenges are discussed to provide insights for future development.
2. Fiber-shaped nanogenerators
With the popularization of flexible devices for smart lifestyles, portable electronics with wearability and multifunctionality, such as watches, eyeglasses, shoes, bracelets and in vivo implants, have received increasing attention from society.37 It is well know that to drive electronics to work, a continuous and stable current must be provided, just like blood continuously transferring enough nutrition to tissues. Traditional energy conversion and storage devices cannot be mounted on the body or integrated with textile because of their intrinsic rigid and bulky characteristics. Therefore, power sources such as flexible batteries and supercapacitors have played an important role in energy storage.38,39 However, in most situations, regular charging and replacement limit their applications, usually resulting in a poor user experience, wasting a large amount of time and a heavy financial burden. For example, people must find a charging pile and then wait a long time for the function of devices to be refreshed. In addition, the leakage of toxic and mordant electrolytes is a hidden health hazard because of the possible cracks on the package caused by movement and pressure from the body. Finally, these devices are usually sensitive to water, which leads to their malfunction after washing. Thus, to meet the energy demand of wearable devices and avoid unnecessary risks, different types of devices that can generate power from renewable sources have been assembled, such as nanogenerators and solar cells.40–42 In 2006, Wang and co-workers discovered piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENG), where mechanical energy was converted into electricity via the piezoelectric effect of nanowires.43 The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), another type of nanogenerator, was first proposed in 2012.44 Benefiting from these great inventions, wearable devices have acquired an enormous advancement in energy harvesting, which has completely overturned the way of generating electricity, from non-reproducible mineral resources to clean, abundant and environmentally friendly renewable sources.
Nanogenerators, as self-power devices used in wearable systems, have two main working modes. Firstly, nanogenerators can produce electric energy from different types of energy, such as wind energy, mechanical energy and wave energy.45,46 In fact, we live in an interconnected, conserved and circular world. Accordingly, a large amount of useful, renewable and sustainable energy can be obtained from the surrounding environment.47–49 More importantly, our body is the most precise and greatest reactor in nature. Various energies can be generated by biological reaction for breathing, moving and against the cold. In these processes, the reaction efficiency does not reach a high level, leading to unnecessary energy wastage.50–53 Therefore, there is an opportunity to harvest a portion of energy, which can be converted into electrical energy, and then support the operation of devices. This not only can improve the utilization efficiency of total energy, but also obtain sufficient power for the operation of systems. Secondly, nanogenerators can connect with sensors for heath monitoring.54–56 Typically, the sensor detects the change in current density in the nanogenerator, working as a self-powered heath sensor.57–59 The other one is that energy storage devices store the electricity obtained from a nanogenerator and then support the working of the sensor.60,61 Regardless of the chosen application, the nanogenerator must possess optimal structural features for integration.
Fiber-shaped nanogenerators are a promising choice for flexible devices due to the following reasons. Firstly, fibers usually have high mechanical strength and can withstand all type of mechanical deformation such as bending, rolling, and twisting. Secondly, fibers possess high permeability and warmth retention, and thus can manage the temperature. Finally, due to their flexibility and one-dimensional structure, fiber-shaped devices can be integrated with textiles at any time without any complicated requirements.62 In this section, according to the different power generation mechanisms, we summarize the fiber-shaped PENG and TENG from the perspectives of assembly method, performance and integration capability. The summary of textile-shaped nanogenerators can be found in other reports.46,63–65
2.1. Fiber-shaped piezoelectric nanogenerators
Piezoelectricity is the most important parameter for materials that are processed into an electrode in nanogenerators. Piezoelectric materials can be divided into piezoceramics and piezopolymers, which include semiconducting nanomaterials,37,66 lead-based ceramics,67,68 and lead-free ceramics,68–70 and polypropylene71 and poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF),72 respectively. Compared with piezoceramics, piezopolymers especially PVDF show a bright future in nanogenerator because of their flexibility, processability and strong sensitivity. Some researchers have demonstrated that incorporating piezoceramics with piezopolymers is beneficial to improve their energy conversion efficiency.73–77 Moreover, introduction of nanostructures in electrodes can be applied for optimizing their performance including superior mechanical properties, flexibility, and piezoelectric effect.
According to the original theory, the conductor–insulator–conductor structure is the basic technology for PENG, when insulator layer is substituted by the piezoelectric materials. A typical example of the working mechanism of fiber-shaped nanogenerators is shown in Fig. 2.78 Initially, the outer layer of the PTFE-coated carbon nanotube/cotton fiber is charged with the negative electrostatic charges of Q, while the other electrode is grounded. Owning to the electrostatic induction and conservation of charges, the CNT surface accumulates positive charges. The electric field can be constructed between electrodes. When the fiber-shaped nanogenerator is affected by strain from the outside, more positive charges can accumulate on the CNT-coated cotton electrode due to electrostatic induction. Therefore, the free electrons on the CNT-coated cotton will flow to the PTFE-coated CNT film, and an instantaneous self-defined positive current will be produce, driving the electronics. In this process, the negative charges on PTFE can be retained because electrostatic charges exist in all the PTFE fibers. After release, the charge distribution recovers to the initial states, and an opposite current can be detected in circuit. This mechanism was constructed on account of a two parallel fiber model, but the charge distribution under pressure was same in another fiber-shaped PENG.

2.1.1. Fiber-shaped PENGs for energy harvesting. 
A variety of fiber-shaped PENG have been designed and used for harvesting energy from human motion (Fig. 3).79–83 In most situations, PENG for energy harvesting are assembled with the coaxial structure, where the conductive fiber serves as the internal collector. Then piezoelectric materials are coated or grown on the conductive fiber. Finally, the fiber or film collector as the external electrode is packaged in the nanogenerator. The design of suitable structures of piezoelectric materials can improve the electrochemical performance of nanogenerators. Especially, aiming to develop robust devices, all components should possess excellent mechanical strength and maintain stable interface interactions under bending.

The synergistic effect between piezoceramics and piezopolymers is a promising method for improving the performance of PENG. Because of its high piezoelectric coefficient, PVDF is widely applied in PENG. The structure of the PVDF molecule consists of four crystalline phases, where the β-phase shows the largest spontaneous polarization per unit cell.86 Wang and co-workers proposed ZnO nanowires and PVDF hybrid materials as positive and negative piezoelectric layers, respectively (Fig. 3a).79 Firstly, a plane-type device with a laminated structure was assembled using Kapton, an Au/Cr electrode, ZnO nanowires and PVDF. In this system, the ZnO nanowire array can interact with the polymer, which is not only regarded as an electrode, but also leads to the formation of a stable interface owning to its high surface area. When the plane device was applied over the common low-frequency regime for human activities, the highest values of voltage, current and power density reached 0.18 V, 5 nA cm−2 and 1 μW cm−3, respectively. This structure could be used to build a fiber-shaped device. The hybrid fiber generator with a length of 2 cm showed a high output voltage and current density, reaching 0.1 V and 10 nA cm−2, respectively. The excellent electrochemical performance is attributed to the ZnO nanowires serving as a piezoelectric-potential generator and as an additive to enhance the surface contact area. Moreover, the ZnO nanowires contributed to the formation of a uniform PVDF layer around the fiber by the dip coating method. The PVDF polymer plays an important role in the piezoelectric performance with ZnO nanowires and as a protective material for high durability under deformation.79 Under the condition of elongation and bending, the hybrid fiber-shaped device converted mechanical deformation into electricity based on the constructive piezoelectric potential from the ZnO nanowires and PVD.
On account of the characteristic of its combined semiconductor and piezoelectric properties, ZnO has received considerable attention in PENG. In another work, Zhang and co-workers grew ZnO nanowires on carbon fibers and paper via a two-step hydrothermal method.81 Then, a layer of Au was deposited on the paper substrate with a ZnO nanowire array using a magnetron sputtering system. A fiber-based PENG was assembled by wrapping modified paper on carbon fiber (Fig. 3b). The output current density was about 0.09 μA cm−2 for a single-fiber based generator. PVDF, as a classical piezoelectric polymer, can be directly used in PENG. A helical structure PENG was assembled by covering an elastic core, fabric band and PVDF strap with Ni/Cu alloy deposited on both sides (Fig. 3c).84 Specifically, because of the opposite direction of the PVDF strap and fabric band, the piezoelectric strap will rotate along the pulling direction under stretching motion. Subsequently, torsional stress and longitudinal stress are produced on the PVDF surface, finally generating alternating electricity. Gao and co-workers designed a new strategy via the integration of electrospinning and coating methods to develop fiber-shaped PENG (Fig. 3d).83 Soaking a nanofiber-coated core conductive electrode in PVDF solution ensured uniform coating owning to the porous scaffold of the mesh. The following coating film was regarded as an interface stabilizer between the PVDF nanofiber and inner core. The resultant yarn showed a peak voltage, peak current and power density of 0.52 V, 18.76 nA and 5.54 μW cm−3, respectively.
To overcome the most common issues in flexible PENG including weak processing technology, slow production efficiency and lower power density, Spinks and co-workers assembled novel triaxial braided piezo fiber energy harvesters using a Trenz-Export braiding machine, in which silver-coated nylon and PVDF fiber were regarded as the electrodes and braided piezoelectric, respectively (Fig. 3e).80 Specifically, melt-spun PVDF with a diameter of 170 μm was prepared using a twin screw extruder at a temperature in the range of 180–220 °C. Then the poling process was carried out by applying a voltage of 20 kV for 10 min on PVDF filament, which could maximize the piezoelectric response. After treatment, the power generation capability was enhanced by reorientation of the dipole moments. Finally, the interlayer melt-spun braided PVDF fiber could interact together and transfer electrons to the silver. Compared with another structure, the braided PVDF yarn presented a higher mechanical performance and excellent fatigue resistance upon compressing and bending. Moreover, because of the special triaxial braided PVDF yarn structure, it provided the maximum output voltage of 380 mV and output power of 0.8 μW under the pressure of 0.023 MPa based on the woven textile energy system. Under 50% strain, thousands of cycles could be realized. Therefore, this is a promising method for use in industry owning to the continuous preparation of components.
Further, Skorobogatiy and co-workers85 adopted a novel structure for high performance PENG. A perovskite ceramic (BaTiO3 or Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3) and CNT were impregnated into a PVDF flexible hybrid mat via electrostatic spinning. The preform was prepared by alternately rolling two types of PVDF films and carbon-impregnated low-density polyethylene. After melt drawing, a kilometer-long piezoelectric fiber with sub-millimeter diameter, which possessed a spiral multilayer cladding structure consisting of alternating layers of piezoelectric nanocomposites and conductive polymer, was fabricated (Fig. 3f and g). The proposed fiber possessed a very large active area for the generation of piezoelectricity and smaller gaps between two electrodes, leading to a higher poling efficiency, piezoelectric current and voltage exceeding that of most existing piezoelectric cables. The final spiral geometry nanogenerator presented excellent flexibility and electrical durability and it could be knit with cotton and integrated with textile by machine.


2.1.2. Fiber-shaped PENGs for health monitoring. 
Smart garments with the function of sensing physiological and biomechanical signals are important for personalized healthcare. In some situations, energy storage devices play a critical role in sensor systems. The sensors receive information from the body such as breathing and vibrating, and the energy storage device supports sufficient power.87,88 A nanogenerator produces a cycling current when it is installed at a special location. Even if the vibration is small and imperceptible, an obvious voltage can be detected.
Wang and co-workers89 assembled a flexible nanogenerator based on ZnO/carbon fiber hybrid fibers as the electrode. A textured ZnO thin film covered the carbon fiber surface via the growth of a Zn and active carbon mixture at 900 °C. The carbon fiber was regarded as the electrode for charge transport and flexible substrate. The grown ZnO thin film possessed a thickness of about 250 nm along the [0001] direction. After etching part of the ZnO and coating silver tape on the outside, a fiber-shaped nanogenerator was assembled (Fig. 4a). When pressure was exerted on the hybrid fiber, macroscopic piezopotential electricity was produced across the inner and outer surface. On account of this special structure, the devices can work in harvesting energy from blood vessels, gas pipes and oil pipes. When the nanogenerator was applied as a sensor in a wearable system, the fiber-shaped nanogenerator could monitor air flow in real time. When gentle exhalation was blown on the PENG, a small shape deformation and vibration was made by the breathing wind, resulting in an average output voltage of 1.5 mV and output current of 0.5 nA (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, the PENG could be used in measuring the in situ original blood pressure signal. Fig. 4c shows the dynamic information of the heartbeat. The normal pulse-pressure wave, young person wave and old person wave could be anticipated by the PENG. Therefore, this invention was demonstrated to be a quantitative technique for application in healthcare.

Using the layer-by-layer method, a coaxial fiber-shaped PENG was reported to monitor human inhalation/exhalation.90 A cleaning flexible yarn, inner silver layer, Bi4Ti3O12 piezoelectric active materials, PVDF, silver layer and PDMS packaging layer were overlaid in sequence (Fig. 4d). Especially, when the orthorhombic crystalline phase of Bi4Ti3O12 was coated on the silver layer via the sol–gel method, the addition of PVP was applied to reduce the rate of the hydrolysis and condensation process, which avoided the formation and agglomeration of clusters and decreased the diameter of the crystallite particle (Fig. 4e). Under the application of 1 N periodic mechanical load, the open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current and instantaneous power density reached 60 V, 400 nA and 18.5 mW m−2, respectively. The self-power sensor integrated with a mask demonstrated a great variation in fast and slow constant breath conditions.
Another strategy to construct fiber-shaped PENG is twisting two functional fiber electrodes with each other. Zhou and co-workers developed a metal-free fiber generator. Nitric acid was used to increase the hydrophilicity of cotton threads for the following coating of conducting materials. Multiwall carbon nanotubes were coated onto cotton threads via the ‘dipping and drying’ method as electrodes.78 Then, the one was covered by PTFE as the piezoelectric active layer (Fig. 4f). The two electrodes were twisted to form a double-helix structure, which could convert biomechanical energy into electricity via the electrostatic effect between CNT and PTFE, showing an average output power density of 0.1 μW cm−2. Furthermore, it could be integrated with a power shirt as an effective element and drive a wireless homemade body temperature sensor system steadily (Fig. 4g).

2.2. Fiber-shaped triboelectric nanogenerators
Triboelectrification is the most ubiquitous and facile phenomenon in nature. It is well known that thermal energy can be produced by friction such as drilling wood to make fire. However, a reasonable device due to limited key technology was not invented for converting mechanical energy to electricity until a TENG was assembled and applied with the development of nanotechnology and electronic device.91 Based on coupled effect of contact electrification and electrostatic induction, TENG can harvest energy from human motion.92–94 For example, the footstep and arm movement of a 68 kg adult can produce nearly 67 W and 60 W of power, respectively. Therefore, TENG are candidates in wearable systems due to their high efficiency, low cost and environmentally friendly nature.
TENG can be categorized into four operation modes including single-electrode mode, lateral-sliding mode, vertical contact–separating mode and freestanding triboelectric-layer mode (Fig. 5a).95 The four structures possess special application occasions and merits, but the working mechanisms of the four models are the same. Being similar with PENG, a current can be produced under the electrification effect and electrostatic induction. For instance, the vertical contact–separating mode is the first developed mode in TENG. Initially, there no electrical potential exists. When two electrodes touch each other, electrification occurs immediately, and opposite charges are formed on the surface. After separation, the positive and negative charges will balance between two conductive collectors owning to the electrostatic induction effect. Finally, as the two electrodes are approaching each other again, the accumulated induced charges will rebalance with the opposite direction of the current flow (Fig. 5b).96

2.2.1. Fiber-shaped TENGs with the contact–separation mode. 
According to the structure of fiber-shaped nanogenerators, the contact–separation mode with a coaxial structure can work under the pressing or stretching. Usually, the triboelectric material is sandwiched between two conductive electrodes.58,92,93,97,98 Baik and co-workers97 assembled a highly stretchable 2D fabric consisting of coaxial TENG. Al wires and PDMS tube with a high-aspect-ratio nanotextured surface with vertically aligned nanowires were prepared as components. After the Al wires were inserted into the tube and Al foil was used to cover the outer layer, a waterproof fiber nanogenerator was achieved (Fig. 6a). The devices presented a stable operation in output voltage even at 95% RH. In wearable applications, TENG can be integrated with footstep-driven large-scale power mats, showing a bright future in industry (Fig. 6b).

Taking advantage of the diameter change under stretching, a core–shell structure contact–separation mode nanogenerator can be assembled. All devices integrated on the textile must endure unavoidable stretching coming from human motion. This type of nanogenerator not only generates electricity, but also satisfies the requirement of flexibility. Wang and co-workers99 designed an advanced TENG with the structure of fiber-convolving fiber and stretchable electrode on elastic silicone rubber fiber (Fig. 6c). The basement structure of the TENG is Cu wire twining rubber–carbon nanotube–rubber fiber. After stretching the fiber, the rubber would separate from the Cu wires owning to the decrease in their diameter. Releasing to the initial state, the rubber would contact the Cu wires (Fig. 6d). The fiber-like TENG could be operated at 70% strain and support various energy storage devices and sensors (Fig. 6e).
Besides the coaxial structure, fiber-shaped TENG can be fabricated via the double-helix structure. For example, silver-coated glass microsphere/silicone rubber conductive composite thread was fabricated using a screw extrusion machine, where five of these threads were twisted into one fiber, which was used as one electrode. Another electrode was achieved by coating a layer of silicon. Finally, the whole device was achieved by twisting two elastic fiber electrodes (Fig. 7a).100 The single fiber device with a length of 5 cm generated an open circuit voltage of 3.82 V and short circuit of 65.8 nA. Further, the smart textile weaving from several fiber electrodes showed a voltage of 8.1 V and current of 0.42 nA during the stretching–releasing process. Furthermore, considering the electronic textile having a contact–separation process with clothes during movements, the output voltage and current of electronic textile-cotton tapping were 150 V and 2.45 μA, respectively.

Mechanical deformation is always in multiple directions. Thus, to effectively convert various mechanical deformations into electrical energy, which is vital to improve the application possibilities, some fiber-shaped nanogenerators have been fabricated to realize a collection of multi deformation. Zhai and co-workers101 assembled a novel coaxial hybrid TENG with the integration of a rubber core and elastic wavy shell, which could harvest energy from pressure and stretching (Fig. 7b). The wavy membrane played a critical role in increasing the contact area. The electron from the Cu layer would transfer to the membrane surface, resulting in the separation of positive and negative charges. After removing the compressive force, an electric potential difference would be established between the two components. Pressing again, an opposite current could be produced in the circuit. Within 2 Hz, 10 kPa continuous contact movement, the maximum instantaneous voltage and current remarkably reached 128 V and 3.3 μA, respectively (Fig. 7c). Moreover, enhancing the pressure force could increase the Voc and peak-to-peak current (Ipp) values, and a higher frequency resulted in an improvement in Ipp. In addition, the devices could be operated under stretching in the single electrode mode (Fig. 7d). Therefore, ultrafast operational speed is better for the higher electrochemical performance of nanogenerators.
Different from the typical TENG, a multimodal ferrofluid-based triboelectric generator was assembled using a deformable elastomer tube filled with a ferrofluid, as a triboelectric layer, surrounded by a patterned copper wire to sense a magnetic field, noise level and falling or drowning. The smart device exhibited an obvious signal under extreme conformability (Fig. 7e). Specially, the ferrofluid acted as a triboelectric layer, which could work without any other natural energy source. Due to the intrinsic fluidity of the ferrofluid and elasticity of the outer packaging silicone layer, the TENG possessed the ability to maintain a stable operation under up to 300% strain (Fig. 7f). Initially, multi-domain Fe nanoparticles were suspended in a colloidal for magnetoactive ferrofluids, which could reversibly transform liquid to semisolid states by applying a magnetic field. When a strong magnetic field approached the device, the particle arrangement momentarily changed from a random orientation to spike structures, leading to an increase in fluid diameter and effective contact. Additionally, the spike structure sustained the same shape and did not show separation over time in the presence of a magnetic field (Fig. 7g).57


2.2.2. Fiber-shaped TENGs with the single electrode mode. 
Most of fiber-shaped TENGs produced electricity from the contact between two or more fiber electrodes. However, they were not very robust to form contact and separation between fiber electrodes. Single electrode-based fiber-shaped TENGs show a simple and reasonable structure for application. For example, a rubber fiber convolved conductive thread following silicone rubber coating served as a single electrode, which generated electrical energy from the contact between silicon and human skin.102 Due to this single electrode structure, the device exhibited excellent stretchability of 100%. Furthermore, this type of device exhibits superior stability without performance degradation in usage. A coaxial fiber-shaped nanogenerator with a conventional structure was developed by Wang and co-workers (Fig. 8a).103 Then the device was sewn into a serpentine shape on both sides of an elastic textile to prepare a stretchable system. Taking advantage of the deformation endurance from the special shape, the system presented a strain of up to 100%, which exceeded most of the reported stretchable coaxial fiber-shaped TENGs. Besides modifying the shape of the device, Sun and co-workers59 demonstrated a method that changes the geometries of spiral steel to accommodate complex mechanical deformation owning to the Young's modulus mismatch of interface compatibility. The final TENG could be fabricated by burying spiral steel wire into two half circular acrylic molds with the impletion of a curing agent and silicone rubber mixture.

The mass production of nanogenerators is still in its infancy, but important. Wang and co-workers proposed a modified melt-spinning method to fabricate stretchable triboelectric yarns, and the length of the device could be up to 100 meters.104 The designed molding is important for the preparation. The silicon polymer could be melted at part I, and then cooled at part II, in which the silicon preformed and avoid conglutination between the conductive steel and rubber (Fig. 8b and c). The obtained nanogenerator was collected on a reeling roller (Fig. 8d). The dynamic process of the polarization of water molecules occurred together with the potential generation of the hybrid fiber. Triboelectrification would produce surface charges on the device, leading to the induction polarization of water. Then, the charge in water will enhance the former in the subsequent contact electrification processes until equilibrium is achieved. Upon increasing the length of the devices, the output voltage still could maintain a high level, reaching 13 V.
In summary, fiber-shaped nanogenerators can be easily integrated with clothing for the effective collection of the mechanical energy from human body motions and self-powered wearable sensing. The performance of each introduced nanogenerator is summarized in Table 1. However, their current and power are still not enough to drive high-power electronics. Thus, it is a good choice to combine nanogenerators with other fiber-shaped energy harvesting devices for their application. In addition, compared with textile-based nanogenerators, fiber-shaped nanogenerators should be consider based on the application conditions. Finally, in most situations, the fiber-shaped nanogenerator will be knitted or integrated with clothing.

3. Fiber-shaped solar cells
Different from nanogenerators, solar cells can convert solar energy to electrical energy. Thus, the application of solar cells shows a more promising future. Firstly, solar cells possess higher power owning to their intrinsic characteristic. Under the same working time, solar cells can provide more energy for electronics.110–114 Secondly, the amount of mechanical energy coming from the human motion is limited, whereas solar energy is infinite. Finally, solid-state and silicon-based solar cells were commercialized several decades ago. Therefore, the possibility for the large-scale production of solar cells is higher than nanogenerators. Factually, all the energy in the world comes from solar energy, where just the type varies. Accordingly, the direct application of solar energy is a significant topic in solving the energy crisis.
Various solar cells have been produced and applied in society, but their low bending radius structure and high-cost limit their application in wearable systems. They can be mainly divided into three types, including dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs),116,117 organic solar cells (OSCs),118–120 and perovskite solar cells (PSCs),121,122 which have received significant attention. Structurally, OSCs and PSCs with similar configurations were assembled using an anode, cathode and photoactive layer. To reduce the charge recombination, an electron transport layer and hole transport layer were also introduced, respectively. For DSCs, a liquid electrolyte was added for charge transport and redox reaction. Specifically, the working mechanisms of DSCs, OSCs and PSCs are shown in Fig. 9.115 Therefore, depending on the type of solar cells, the initial aim is to fabricate flexible electrodes and suitable electrolytes. Each component should be able to maintain flexibility at room temperature and resist bending or pressure force. Moreover, the interface between different components should be delicately designed in morphology or surface to improve the stability of operation.41,123

The rapid development of wearable electronics has pushed the development of solar cells toward the direction of miniaturization, flexibility, portability, and wearability. Fiber-shaped solar cells can be well integrated with textiles, making them a good candidate for flexible devices, and they can complement nanogenerators. Compared with traditional solar cells, the processing of fiber-shaped solar cells is very different. For example, the fiber electrode is small and flexible, and thus coating the active materials onto the curved surface is a vital step for obtaining high performance devices. In this part, we summarize three types of fiber-shaped solar cells, including fiber-shaped DSCs, OSCs, and PSCs, from the perspectives of electrode design and assembling methods of devices.
3.1. Fiber-shaped dye-sensitized solar cells
Due to their high efficiency, low cost, environmental friendliness and low incident light angle dependence, DSCs have received increasing attention.124,125 With the aim to integrate them on the textiles, DSCs have been developed to have a film-based or fiber-shaped structure. Replacing transparent conductive oxides, such as ITO/polymer composite substrates, which are commonly used in planar DSCs, with conductive fibers is an important method for designing fiber-shaped DSCs. Some unique advantages, including excellent bending, shape-changing ability and 3D light harvesting capability, ensure the bright future of fiber-shaped devices.126,127

3.1.1. Fiber anode. 
In 2002, Koyuncu and co-workers128 proposed the first fiber-shaped DSCs, where stainless steel-coated semiconductive nanosized TiO2 and ceramic powder acted as the electrode and then packaged into a transparent polymer tube. Then, Zou and co-workers129 assembled DSCs, which opened the door for fiber-shaped solar cells. To overcome the disadvantage of rigid conductive glass in wearable systems, flexible electrodes must be used to assemble one-dimensional DSCs without any transparent conducting oxide in both electrodes. Furthermore, the electrode should be cheap, transparent, highly flexible and highly conductive, which are satisfied with the requirement of structure. Finally, a simple helical twisting structure was constructed for fiber-shaped solar cell (Fig. 10a and b). Because of this special structure, various opaque conducting materials can be successfully applied. In this system, TiO2 colloid was dipped on stainless steel as the working electrode, while Pt wire was employed directly as the counter electrode directly (Fig. 10c and d). When the thickness of TiO2 was 3.5 μm, the Voc, Isc and fill factor of the fiber-shaped solar cell with a length of 5 cm were 610 mV, 0.06 mA and 0.38, respectively. Moreover, the I–V output of the solar cell could remain stable under the incident angle of light.

Based on the successful demonstration of fiber-shaped DSCs, many efforts have been made to improve their performance. TiO2 is employed as a common anode electrode material in solar cells. There are many methods for growing different morphologies of TiO2 on one-dimensional substrates, such as hydrothermal method,130,131 polymer-templated growth,132 dip coating,133,134 electrochemical deposition135 and anodizing.136,137 The direct use of TiO2 nanoparticles as active materials is a low-cost and bio-friendly method. Due to their high conductivity and stability, carbon-based fibers are applied as the skeleton for the current collector and system integration. TiO2 particles can be anchored on the surface of carbon nanotube fibers by the dip coating method followed by sintering at 500 °C for 1 h.133 The thickness of the TiO2 layer was adjusted between 4 and 30 μm according to the time of dip coating (Fig. 11a and b). Matching with pure CNT fiber and electrolyte, the twined structure device showed an open-circuit voltage of 0.64 V, short-circuit current density of 9.03 mA cm−2 and fill factor of 2.6%. In addition, the performance of the device could remain steady under a high incident angle (Fig. 11c).

Reproduced with permission.135 Copyright 2015, The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
The electrophoresis deposition technique (EPD), the traditional ceramic technique to produce advanced materials, was applied to deposit TiO2 mesoporous spheres onto the surface of Ti threads, which was proposed by Zou and co-workers.135 The charged particles moved to the electrode by an electric field and then accumulated on the surface and formed a coherent deposit. In this process, many complexly shaped materials could be prepared accurately. Furthermore, the simple equipment, low cost, high speed, process simplicity and controllable thickness are obvious advantages in the fabrication of advanced materials. Iodine and TiO2 powder in acetone solution with the assistance of ultrasonication was applied for the EPD process. After sintering, the final TiO2 mesoporous sphere-coated Ti wire, Pt wire, and N719 were used to assemble a coaxial device (Fig. 11d–f). Thus, this provides a novel method to fabricate fiber-shaped working electrodes in solar cells.
Besides nanoparticles, one-dimensional TiO2 nanotubes and nanowires were introduced via the anodization137 and hydrothermal methods,130 respectively. A TiO2 nanotube array on Ti wire electrode showed excellent flexibility and it guaranteed enough mechanical strength between the substrate and functional film, preventing it from breaking off during the knitting and weaving process (Fig. 12a and b). This device presented an excellent mechanical and electrochemical performance. The photoelectric conversion efficiency reached 7%. Furthermore, it can be woven into curtains, tents and bags for integrating with other electronics. Lee and co-workers130 demonstrated that a spring-like TiO2 coating on Ti wire as the working electrode exhibited an excellent photoelectric conversion efficiency retention rate of 97% (Fig. 12c). The TiO2 with the special morphology was synthesized via the hydrothermal method by adjusting the concentration of NaOH, followed by sintering at 450 °C for 0.5 h (Fig. 12d). Additionally, the fiber-shaped anode wrapped around an elastic fiber in a spiral path, thus endowing the device an excellent performance even under high stretching conditions. Various parameters such as Voc, FF, Jsc and PEC remained stable with an increase in the stretching degree (Fig. 12e).

Zou and co-workers138 fabricated a novel micro-cone TiO2 nanowire on the surface of Ti wire for fiber-shaped electrodes. Firstly, the Ti wire was activated in hydrofluoric and hydrochloric acid solutions for 1 min. Next, the pretreated Ti wire was anodized under a certain voltage for several hours. Finally, the TiO2 nanowire was grown on the TiO2 cone via hydrothermal reaction using titanium potassium oxalate as the Ti source. The micro-cone array avoided the extrusion and cracking under bending condition and improved the flexibility of the solar cell (Fig. 12f and g). In addition, the TiO2 nanowire could enhance the dye absorption, leading to a high PCE value. Matching with Pt wire as the counter electrode, the fiber-shaped solar cell exhibited a minimum bending radius of 0.45 mm, PCE of 4.75% and more than 96.6% retention of the initial PCE after the bending test.
Lee and co-workers136 developed a Ti microridge/nanorod-modified wire substrate to study the influence of a rough surface on the photoelectrode performance. The anodizing method and mixed acid etching were used to fabricate the microridge and nanorod microcosmic structures, respectively. The microridges could be used as a channel to transport electrons rapidly and shorten the transport distance from the original location in the TiO2 layer to the substrate. The Ti nanorods coated by TiO2 compact layer suppressed electron combination and improved the electron lifetime by increasing the contact area between the wire substrate and TiO2. Therefore, the microridge array could enhance the transport speed of electrons at the interface, and the function of the nanorod was to extend the lifetime of the electrons (Fig. 13a). In the light absorption part, the microridges and nanorod were regarded as micropits to gather light by reflecting it many times, taking advantage of the light scattering ability to improve the utilization rate of incident light (Fig. 13b). Overall, based on its multiscale microstructure, the TiO2-decorated Ti wire as flexible electrode is a rational direction to build high performance solar cells.

Solar cells with a higher energy conversion efficiency could be achieved via the ALD method by coating a TiO2 film on Ti wire.139 The insertion of a uniform and pinhole-free TiO2 film on Ti wires could improve the electrical contact. By adjusting the film thickness, a high conversion efficiency of 7.41% could be obtained when a 15 nm film was formed on the surface. Owning to the advantage of the ALD method, the film thickness could be controlled precisely, and the efficiency, stability and flexibility improved obviously. Additionally, ALD treatment increased the synergistic effect and the interfacial adhesion between TiO2 and Ti wire, resulting in an increase in the photocurrent and fill factor. Therefore, the electron transport and charge collection efficiency improved simultaneously.
Besides morphology design, the hybridization of TiO2 and a second component is another method for enhancing the performance of solar cells. The preparation of rutile phase SnO2 nanoparticles on Ti wire via direct thermal sintering, followed by dip coating in TiO2 colloid resulted in the formation of an SnO2–TiO2 junction.140 Because of the positive effect on Jsc enhancement, recombination shielding effect of the TiO2 film and high efficiency contribution by the SnO2 layer, the efficiency of 5.8% was achieved. The incorporation of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) with TiO2 is another effective method, which enhanced the Voc, Jsc and PCE from 0.775 V, 8.344 mA cm−2 and 3.94% to 0.798 V, 12.935 mA cm−2 and 5.364%, respectively.141 This result is attributed to the improved rate of electron transport via rGO and enhanced separation of hole–electron pairs via the rGO–TiO2 heterojunction. In addition, rGO endowed the electrode higher mechanical property, which is beneficial for its application in smart textiles on a large scale.
A ZnO nanoarray, which has a similar bandgap to that of TiO2, was applied for flexible solar cells. Fan and co-workers grew a ZnO nanowire substrate by plating Ni142 or Mn143via a wet process as a photoanode. For example, a layer of Mn inserted between ZnO and conductive wire via the electroplating method could improve the energy conversion efficiently due to the good conductivity and low surface working function. A layer of CuI was covered between ZnO nanowires to collect holes from the dye and then transfer to the counter electrode. The continuous growth of ZnO on a metal-plated polymer wire was fabricated using home-made equipment.144 Specifically, an Ni-coated polymer substrate was treated with zinc acetate and hexamethylenetetramine solution to add a layer of ZnO nanoseeds. Then the modified fiber was immersed in a continuous reactor and washed using zinc acetate and hexamethylenetetramine solution. The final ZnO nanolayer could be controlled by the reaction time and the length of the tube. This method provides a possibility for large scale production.


3.1.2. Fiber cathode. 
Pt is a classical catalyst in solar cells and fuel cells due to its high conductivity, stability and excellent catalyst activity. In fiber-shaped solar cells, Pt wire is usually applied as the counter electrode.116,117,145,146 However, the catalytic efficiency of bulk Pt is low because only the surface layer is used for the reaction. Accordingly, a reasonable solution to overcome this is combining Pt nanoparticles with flexible and conductive substrates. To solve the problem of pure Pt wire, Cao and co-workers145 incorporated Pt nanoparticles in a CNT film not only for maintaining the size of the counter electrodes, but also to provide a higher surface area for redox reactions. Hybrid yarns could be prepared by immersing the CNT film into a Pt (∼2–3 nm) particle solution, followed by drying and twisting (Fig. 14a and b). Matching with the TiO2–Ti primary electrode, the CNT–Pt yarn showed a Voc of 0.54 V, Jsc of 15.3 mA cm−2 and power conversion efficiency of 4.85%. In contrast, the solar cell based on a Pt wire counter electrode exhibited a slight increase in Voc, which was attributed to the lower potential of Pt, but smaller Jsc of 12.4 mA cm−2 and power conversion efficiency of 4.23% under the same experimental conditions.

Taking advantage of the active sites on carbon-based materials, a CNT/graphene hybrid fiber was prepared to catalyze redox reactions. Peng and co-workers116 demonstrated a novel graphene-encapsulated carbon nanotube fiber, where the CNT core fiber provided excellent tensile strength, flexibility and electrical conductivity and the graphene sheath offered more exposed edges for high electrocatalytic activity (Fig. 14c). After depositing Pt nanoparticles on the hybrid fiber, the final device presented a higher efficiency of 6.83% compared with that based on CNT/Pt fiber (Fig. 14d). This result was attributed to the lower charge transfer resistance in the counter electrode coming from the synergetic effect between the CNT and graphene sheets. Further, graphene nanosheets hybridized among neighboring carbon nanotubes were produced via dry spinning CNT array stacked graphene along the length direction (Fig. 14e and f).117 Owning to the π–π interaction between CNT and rGO, the composite fiber presented a remarkable mechanical and electrical performance, reaching to 630 MPa and 450 S m−1, respectively. Thus, the final power conversion efficiencies of the fiber-shaped device improved to 8.50%.
To overcome the hydrophobic nature of CNT fibers and still remain high electrical conductivity and mechanical properties, a hydrophilic aligned CNT sheath was covered, which could be closely incorporated with the electrolyte.146 A pure CNT array was treated with oxygen microwave plasma to decorate enough oxygen-containing functional groups on its surface (Fig. 14g and h). Obviously, due to introduction of defects in the CNT fiber, the mechanical, conductivity and water contact angle decrease from 374 MPa, 460 S cm−1 and 123° to 125 MPa, 256 S cm−1 and 15°, respectively. The hydrophilic characteristic of the carbon fiber provided more sites to anchor Pt nanoparticles. After treatment with K2PtCl6 solution, the counter electrode presented the highest power conversion efficiency of 10% at that time. Furthermore, several solar cells could be connected and integrated with textiles for driving electronics even under the bending state. Graphene-based fibers can be also used as the counter electrode to construct fiber-shaped DSCs. Graphene fibers were prepared via wet spinning, exhibiting a density of 0.61 g cm−3, strength of 102–103 MPa, and electrical conductivity of 102–103 S cm−1. The graphene fiber electrodeposited with Pt nanoparticles was twisted with Ti wire to produce a fiber-shaped solar cell. The novel fiber-shaped photovoltaic devices resulted in a certified maximum energy conversion efficiency of 8.45% when graphene/Pt was used as the counter electrode.147
In addition to carbon-based active materials, conductive polymers were also introduced into fibers for pursuing higher performance. Owning to their excellent conductivity and easy fabrication, polyaniline148 and PEDOT:PSS149 as active materials were coated on CNT fibers via the electrochemical polymerization and dip coating methods, respectively. However, compared with the carbon hybrid fibers, the device efficiency based on conductive polymers showed a mild performance. Zou and co-workers150 firstly used a polymer as the counter electrode. Owning to the important role of the electrode in collecting electron/hole carriers and loading functional materials, the conductive polymer PEDOT:PSS was chosen as the catalyst. PEDOT:PSS could be loaded on the conductive fiber via the dip-coating method (Fig. 15a and b). Because of their similar characteristics, the polymer exhibited good interaction with the textile thread. Consequently, the wire-shaped DSCs achieved 4.8% efficiency and presented a relationship between length and electrochemical performance (Fig. 15c).

Aiming to decrease the cost, a platinum-free fiber counter electrode was also developed, consisting of various organic and inorganic materials as the catalyst, such as TiN,124 metal chalcogen,125,151,152 polymer148,149,153 and carbon-based material.154 Zou and co-workers reported the growth of highly crystalline metal (Co, Ni) selenium (Co0.85Se or Ni0.85Se) nanosheets on metal wire directly via the in situ solvothermal process.125 Compared with Pt fiber, the metal selenium nanosheets possessed higher performance in power conversion efficiency, demonstrating 6.55% for Co/Co0.85Se and 7.07% for Ni/Ni0.85Se (Fig. 15d). This result was mainly ascribed to the following four factors: (1) the metal selenium shows excellent intrinsic electrical property in the catalyst; (2) M0.85Se nanosheets provide more channels and void space for the diffusion and reaction of the electrolyte; (3) nanosheets show a higher surface area; and (4) tight contact between the catalyst and conductive metal wire is guaranteed via the in situ growth process.
The growth of inorganic materials on conductive fiber also could be employed to fabricate counter electrodes for fiber-shaped DSCs.124,151,152 Nanoribbon and nanorod CoNi2S4 anchored on the surface of carbon fibers via the hydrothermal method with different types of nickel sources served as the counter electrode (Fig. 15e).155 The carbon fiber and CoNi2S4 were regarded as the conductive substrate and high activity catalyst, respectively. The morphology of the CoNi2S4/carbon fiber had an effect on the performance, and the conversion efficiency reached 7.03% for the nanoribbons, but only 4.10% for the nanorods, which was attributed to the exposed crystal facet (Fig. 15f). Besides, this excellent conversion efficiency also surpassed that of the Pt wire (6.45%). In general, lots of advanced fiber electrodes have been smartly designed and used in fiber-shaped DSCs, which improve the energy conversion efficiency of fiber-shaped DSCs. The typical fiber electrodes and related photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2.

3.2. Fiber-shaped organic solar cells
Compared with DSCs, OSCs show greater safety and suitability for flexible devices in practical applications because of their all-solid structure. Specifically, the efficiency of polymer solar cells is determined by their electrode materials, device structure, band gaps and tandem junction. Fiber-based organic photovoltaic devices were firstly assembled by Shtein and co-workers.158 The coaxial fiber-shaped device was defined in a 1 mm long range, which consisted of light-absorbing organic materials sandwiched between a conductive electrode and transparent electrode (Fig. 16a). In this work, the fiber-shaped solar cell was compared with a film-based device. Especially, the two types of devices presented different electrochemical performances under different incident angles. For the planar solar cell, the FF showed a stable value, while its Voc and Jsc decreased with an increase in the illumination angle. Furthermore, the fiber-shaped devices showed that the energy conversion efficiency remained stable with the azimuthal illumination angle (Fig. 16b). Graphene sheets with excellent performance in electrical conductivity represent the thinnest optical transparency electrode. Therefore, substituting the original cathode with a graphene film could improve the light absorbing efficiency and transmission rate of electrons. Single-layer graphene sheets were prepared via the CVD method on Cu film and then transferred to the surface of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The cell efficiency reached 2.53% when the polymer hybrid film was wrapped on the preform fiber device.119

To overcome the risk of puncture between the rigid metal and thin polymer layers in polymer-coated fiber or wire, Cao and co-workers159 further modified fiber-shaped OSCs for high flexibility and performance. Initially, ZnO as a hole-blocking layer was deposited on stainless steel wires by immersion followed by annealing. Then, a classical bulk heterojunction layer of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was coated on the ZnO layer by repeated solution dipping and thermal annealing. Subsequently, a PEDOT:PSS layer was dip-coated to increase the electrical contact and hole transport. Finally, a CNT film as the counter electrode covered the device (Fig. 16c). The cell could achieve the power conversion efficiency of 2% under different bending angles. Based on same device structure, Peng and co-workers161 assembled a flexible solar cell by incorporating a thin titania particle layer between the photoactive materials and electrode. After treating the Ti wire by electrochemical anodization, followed by modification with TiCl4 for 30 min, the final photoanode was achieved. The modified layer could enhance the adsorption efficiency of the photoactive materials and charge transport. Compared with the OSCs without the titania nanoparticle layer, the energy efficiency increased to 36%.
Fiber-shaped OSCs usually suffer from failure under mechanical stress and stretching from movements. Thus, a reasonable and smart structure-integrated spiral Ti wire with an elastic substrate was designed, which could achieve stable energy conversion efficiency under bending (Fig. 16d). However, the conversion efficiency dramatically dropped under a strain of about 50%, retaining 50% of the original value (Fig. 16e). In addition, although the efficiency was still maintained at 88% for a strain of 40%, the fiber device could not fully recover to its original length after the removal of tension. Also, the fiber device broke under 80% stain. The OSC textile made by weaving the fiber-shaped device together presented 90% efficiency residue for 1000 times stretching. However, the stretching exhibited a large influence on its performance. Compared with before stretching, after stretching by 30% for 50 cycles, the values decreased by more than 10%.
At the current stage, it is still a challenge to connect lots of fiber devices together in a reliable manner while maintaining a stable performance. Recently, an interlaced structure was proposed to fabricate textile-shaped polymer solar cells, where the cathode and anode fibers acted as build blocking to build the photovoltaic textile (Fig. 16f).160 This interlaced structure makes the circuit connection of fiber solar cells easier. The underlying working mechanism is that holes are generated in the active layer and transported to the anode fiber, while electrons are transported to the cathode fibers from the intersection of the vertical arrayed cathode and anode. The series connection between the cathode and anode at weft and warp directions provides a stable interface under stress and bending. In addition, the output voltage and current can be tuned by changing the number of electrodes woven. Thus, due to the solid structure of OSCs, a photovoltaic textile was constructed in a large area using an industrial loom. This novel structure smartly combined device fabrication, textile weaving and circuit connection, which can reduce device cost and facilitate the commercialization of OSCs (Fig. 16g and h).
3.3. Fiber-shaped perovskite solar cells
Perovskite solar cells show higher power conversion efficiencies than OSCs, and thus are expected to become a new era of photovoltaics. In the past few years, the conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells presented an obvious enhancement from 9.7% to more than 20%, and they show a huge advantage in efficiency compared other types of solar cells. The typical structure of a perovskite solar cell consists of an n-type compact layer, mesoporous TiO2 nanocrystal layer, light-harvesting perovskite layer, hole transporting layer and two electrodes. Its working mechanism is that the perovskite layer first produces a number of charges after absorbing light, followed by the injection of electrons into the conduction band of the TiO2 layer and of holes into the hole-transport layer. Then, these two parts are collected by the electrodes, respectively.
In recent years, perovskite solar cells have been assembled into fiber form to enhance the energy conversion efficiency of fiber-shaped solar cells.162 A coaxial fiber-shaped perovskite solar cell with high flexibility was firstly prepared by Peng and co-workers.23Fig. 17a shows the typical structure of a fiber-shaped perovskite solar cell. The compact layer, mesoporous TiO2, MAPbI3, Spiro-OMeTAD and CNT sheet were deposited on stainless steel successively via the dip coating method. Although the energy conversion efficiency just reached 3.3%, which is lower than that of bulk perovskite solar cells, it showed a certain flexibility and weaving ability. Furthermore, this layer-by-layer structure lays the foundation for fiber-shaped perovskite solar cell. Many efforts have been focused on optimizing the materials and structures of devices. Uddin and co-workers163 deposited two layers of TiO2 for faster electron transportation. The dip coating method was used to anchor inter nanoporous TiO2, which was regarded as the foundation layer for the microporous layer and provided a rough surface to attach the major microporous layer. After immersing TiCl4, the hybrid fiber was annealed to improve the surface area and fabricate a smooth surface, originating from the coverage of the TiO2 microporous layer. This two-step method achieved the same result as the spin coating process and uniform light harvesting. Zou and co-workers122 also prepared a fiber-shaped solar cell with this structure. However, the compact TiO2 layer was too smooth to absorb perovskite materials under high curvature. Thus, they treated TiO2 colloid by an autologous heating process instead of air heating to form a more uniform TiO2 mesoporous layer. The thickness of the mesoporous layer is an important parameter for electrical performance. The perovskite layer would be discontinuous and fall off from the smooth compact layer when the thickness of the TiO2 layer is too small (Fig. 17b). However, when the mesoporous layer was thicker than 300 nm, the diffusion length for exciton was surpassed, leading to a reduction in the Jsc. The optimized device with a mesoporous TiO2 thickness of 300 nm achieved the Voc of 0.625 V, Jsc of 11.49 mA cm−2, FF of 0.636 and PCE of 4.57% (Fig. 17c).

(h) Cross-sectional image of the perovskite layer obtained by gas phase reaction. (i) I–V curves of the highest performance devices. Reproduced with permission.123 Copyright 2019, Wiley-VCH. 
To further increase the performance of devices, a flat perovskite layer and aligned CNT sheet as the electrode were introduced to achieve a strip-type perovskite solar cell for high power conversion efficiency of 9.49% (Fig. 17d and e).164 The flat interface enhanced the coverage and crystal size of the perovskite layer and the continuous carbon nanotube sheets were flexible, mechanically strong and electrically conductive, which functioned as the electrode and hole extraction layer. It has been proven that TiO2 nanotubes are a good choice for electron extraction and transport. However, depositing a perovskite layer on a TiO2 nanotube array grown on Ti wire through an anodization process usually causes unsatisfactory results because the crystals do not infiltrate the adjacent nanotubes. Therefore, Peng and co-workers23 developed a cathodic deposition method for loading a PbO layer on the surface of TiO2 (Fig. 17f). In the deposition process, PbO reacts with HI to fabricate a porous PbI2 layer with perfect crystal structure between nanotubes (Fig. 17g). In addition, the thickness of PbI2 could be controlled by the width of the crystal plates. Compared with planar solar cells, the spin-coating, printing and spraying methods cannot be applied in the fiber-shaped devices for special one-dimensional structure.
The perovskite layer fabricated by dip coating usually presents some disadvantages such as low coverage, poor crystal quality and low carrier transport performance. Thus, Zou and co-workers123 proposed a vapor-assisted deposition method to prepare a perovskite layer on a fiber substrate. The two steps for coating PbI2 and CH3NH3I were optimized in the solid-gas reaction (Fig. 17h). Then, the excess CH3NH3I was removed by thermal annealing. Because of the uniform and stable layer array, the fiber-shaped perovskite solar cell showed the highest conversion efficiency of 10.79% (Fig. 17i). Jun and co-workers165 demonstrated an Ag NW electrode as the top electrode owing to the merits of high transmittance, mechanical flexibility and low sheet resistance. Before spray deposition, the Ag NW solution was treated by oxygen plasma to decrease the barrier for charge transport and improve its moderate transmittance. The device showed an enhancement in FF from 0.37 to 0.44.
3.4. Fiber-shaped quantum dot-sensitized solar cells
Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have received increasing attention in the scientific and industrial fields owning to their low cost, easy preparation, high molar extinction coefficient, large intrinsic dipole and impact ionization, and spectral tunability.166–168 The working principle of QDSCs is similar to that of DSCs except that light is absorbed by quantum dots instead of dye molecules. However, the conversion efficiency of most reported QDSCs is lower than that of DSCs, which is ascribed to their narrow absorption range and charge recombination. Furthermore, QDSCs exhibit a bright future in increasing the energy conversion efficiency beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit of 32.7% because of the excellent optoelectronic properties of quantum dots.169 In the typical QDSC, its performance has shown an obvious improvement by exploiting engineered colloidal QDs as a sensitizer and developing novel electrolytes, conductive substrates and counter electrode materials. When the requirement for high performance and flexible energy harvesting devices is proposed, much effort should be focused on optimizing the electrode structure. The achievement of fiber-shaped QDSCs was mediocre.
Li and co-workers170 assembled one-dimensional QDSCs, in which CdS quantum dot-sensitized ZnO nanorods decorated on carbon fibers acted as the working electrode and carbon fiber sputtered Au acted as the counter electrode (Fig. 18a). The anode was fabricated by depositing CdS quantum dots on ZnO nanowires by successive ionic layer adsorption, which could separate the electron hole pairs confined in the quantum dots and transport electrons to the carbon substrate (Fig. 18b). The final fiber-shaped QDSCs presented a highest conversion efficiency of 0.006% via injecting enough aqueous electrolyte into a transparent plastic cladding consisting of 0.5 M Na2S, 0.125 M S and 0.2 M KCl. Besides anode modification, Lin and co-workers171 reported a carbon fiber/Co9S8 nanotube array hybrid fiber as the counter electrode in a spiral-shaped flexible QDSSC (Fig. 18c). The designed counter electrode played a crucial role in collecting electrons from the external circuit and reducing polysulfide electrolytes. In this work, the Co9S8NTs were grown on carbon fiber via chemical bath deposition. Matching with CdS and CdSe-deposited spiral TiO2/Ti wire, the device presented an absolute energy conversion efficiency of 3.79% when applied with 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 illumination (Fig. 18d). To overcome the leakage of liquid electrolyte, a gel polysulfide electrolyte was applied to assemble a quasi-solid-state quantum dot-sensitized solar cell. The flexible QDSCs composed of CdS/CdSe-sensitized TiO2 nanotube array on Ti wire anode and NiCo2S4/Ti wire demonstrated a conversion efficiency of 3.41% and 2.76% with liquid and gel electrolyte condition, respectively, which blended a certain amount of sodium polyacrylate and polysulfide together. Although the electrochemical performance is influenced by high viscous electrolyte, the device is easy to encapsulate.172

In summary, fiber-shaped solar cells have been assembled and applied in wearable systems for energy harvesting. They show enormous potential in miniaturized energy systems. Their unique flexible and lightweight properties endow them with excellent integration function. However, their energy conversion efficiency is still unsatisfactory compared with their bulk devices. Other issues are also accompanied by the development of fiber-shaped solar cells. Firstly, the length of fiber-shaped solar cells is still on the centimeter scale, which is too short for real applications. Secondly, effective and mature technology for the assembly of fiber-shaped solar cells has not been developed to date. Thirdly, a comprehensive understanding of the interface interactions is the key for improving their performance.
4. Fiber-shaped supercapacitors
In the previous chapter, we summarized fiber-shaped energy conversion devices, nanogenerators and solar cells, which convert mechanical and solar energy into electric energy. How this electricity can be used is divided in two ways. One way is to directly use the converted electricity to power electronics. The other way is to store the electricity through energy storage devices. Generally, supercapacitors (SCs) and batteries are widely used for energy storage applications. To meet the needs of wearable applications, energy storage devices in a fiber form have been proposed and developed during the past two decades. This section will focus on wearable fiber-shaped SCs and highlight some representative works in this field.
4.1. Mechanism of supercapacitors
Supercapacitors, also known as electrochemical capacitors and double-layer capacitors, are a new type of energy storage devices different from conventional capacitors and batteries. They have a higher specific energy than conventional capacitors, and higher specific power and longer cycle life than batteries.173 As shown in Fig. 19a, the energy and power density of SCs are between that of traditional parallel plate capacitors and batteries, which is helpful for their applications in high power and energy power supply, such as high power emergency power supply, regulated power supply, emergency exits, rail transportation and portable electronic devices.174

(b) Two categories of electrode materials, electrochemical double-layer capacitor (EDLC) and pseudocapacitor, with different charge storage processes.

At present, the most commonly used electrode materials for SCs are electrochemical double-layer materials (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitive materials (Fig. 19b).175 The energy storage mode of EDLCs mainly depends on the adsorption process of electrolyte ions on the electrode surface, which is a simple physical process. The energy storage mechanism of EDLCs determines the range of electrode materials to be selected, that is, materials with a high specific surface area accessible to electrolyte ions, appropriate pore structure, and high electrical conductivity. Because they possess the abovementioned advantages, carbon materials, mainly including graphene, carbon fibers, carbon nanotubes and carbon black, are the most ideal electrode materials for EDLCs. Different from EDLCs, the energy storage of pseudocapacitive electrodes is achieved through a rapid and reversible electrochemical reaction during the charging/discharging process. To date, the commonly used pseudocapacitive materials are transition metal oxides (RuO2, MnO2, Co3O4, NiO, etc.) and conductive polymers (PANi, PPy, PEDOT, PTh, etc.). For transition metal oxide materials, the energy storage process is mainly redox reaction, whereas for conductive polymer materials, the energy storage process is mainly doping and dedoping reactions. Due to their different energy storage mechanisms, EDLCs and pseudocapacitors have unique characteristics. Generally, EDLCs have higher power density and better cycling stability, whereas pseudocapacitive materials have much higher capacitance and energy density.176
4.2. Fiber-shaped SCs with metallic fiber substrates
Recently, a large number of fibers, including metal fibers, carbon fibers, carbon nanotube fibers, graphene fibers, conductive polymer fibers, and conductive material modified polymer fibers, have been used to make flexible SCs. Typically, metal fibers, carbon fibers, and conductive material-modified polymer fibers are used as current collectors due to their small specific surface areas, while carbon nanotube fibers, graphene fibers, and conductive polymer fibers can be used as both electrode materials and current collectors. In this section, we highlight the recent developments in fiber electrodes for SCs by using a special categorization method based on their chemical components, i.e., metal fibers, carbolic fibers and polymer fibers.
Metal fibers are one of the most commonly used conductive fibers in daily life, which are new industrial materials developed in recent years. Metal fibers can be made by a set of special processes, such as composite assembly of metal wires, multiple cluster drawing, annealing and solution treatment, with thousands or tens of thousands of pieces per share. The diameter of metal fibers can reach 1–2 μm, their elongation is more than 1%, and their mechanical strength can reach 1200–1800 MPa, even more than the tensile strength of the material itself. Compared with organic and inorganic fibers, metal fibers have higher elasticity, flexibility, abrasion resistance, high temperature resistance, corrosion resistance, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity, which make them ideal current collectors for high-performance flexible SCs.
Cu fibers, Ti wires and stainless yarn (316 L) are usually used as the current collectors/substrates for depositing active materials such as conducting polymers and transition metal oxides. However, the smooth surface of metal wires is unfavourable for the high loading of these additive materials. Thus, a range of modification strategies have been developed to increase their surface roughness. As shown in Fig. 20, employing Cu fibers as a cost-effective current collector, a forest-like NiO nanosheets@CNTs@CuO nanowire array/Cu fiber was fabricated via a simple wet-chemical approach.177 The synergistic effects of the forest-like structure on the Cu fiber led to a high electrochemical performance and outstanding mechanical flexibility as follows: (1) the Cu fibers provide high conductivity and flexibility. (2) The CNTs wrapped over the 1D CuO NWAs can improve the mass loading and electron transfer kinetics of the NiO nanosheets. (3) The interconnected arrangement of NiO nanosheets adhered on the CNTs@CuO NWA/Cu fibers with high specific surface provides numerous pathways for electrolyte penetration. The fiber-shaped hybrid SC with AC@CF as the negative electrode and forest-like NiO NSs@CNTs@CuO NWA/Cu fiber as the positive electrode showed high capacitance and energy densities, relatively good cycling stability and deformation stability. The specific capacitance and energy density of the device were 93.42 F g−1 (29.09 cm−1) and 26.32 W h kg−1, respectively, which is comparable with that of previously reported fiber-based solid-state SCs. Its capacitance was maintained at over 83.6% of its initial value after 2000 charging/discharging cycles at a current of 3 mA. Considering wearable and portable electronic applications, deformation stability is crucial. Due to the great flexibility of all the components in the fiber-shaped SC, the device retained over 94.5% of its origin capacitance after 200 cycles of bending, showing outstanding deformation stability. As a demonstration of taking advantage of its flexibility and weavability, a serially connected fiber-shaped SC was woven into a human shirt, which could drive a multifunction electronic display for about 20 min. This work offers some referential experience for using electronic waste to fabricate wearable electronics.

4.3. Fiber-shaped SCs with carbon-based fiber substrates
Due to their excellent conductivity, high specific surface area, good corrosion resistance and low density, carbon materials play an irreplaceable role in the development of conventional SCs.178 The rapid development of flexible SCs also benefits from the continuous progress of carbon materials. Carbolic fibers are a type of fiber consisting mainly of carbon materials, including carbon fibers, carbon nanotube fibers and graphene fibers. Due to the great flexibility, extremely high electrical conductivity, and other excellent performances inherited from carbon materials, carbolic fibers are preferred in the design and fabrication of fiber-shaped SCs. In the following section, a number of representative works will be discussed according to the type of fibers, revealing the potential of carbolic fibers in the fabrication of flexible SCs.

4.3.1. Carbon fiber substrates. 
Carbon fibers (CFs) are a new type of high-performance fibers, which contain more than 95% carbon. Due to the preferred orientation of graphite microcrystalline structure along the fiber axis, CFs have high tensile strength and modulus, together with high electronic conductivity and light weight, which make them one of the best candidates for the fabrication of flexible SC. However, limited by their low surface area (<10 m2 g−1) and dense structure, pristine carbon fibers (PCFs) can only act as a current collector or substrate to load other active materials. Thus, to enhance the surface area and introduce high porosity on PCFs, Yu and co-workers179 developed a facile method to activate PCFs by chemical exfoliation, annealing, and reduction, as shown in Fig. 21a–c. After activation, the surface area of the activated CF (ACF) increased by one order of magnitude from 6 to 92 m2 g−1 compared to that of PCF, and many more mesopores were introduced. Meanwhile, the increased surface area and created porous structure did not impair its mechanical strength and electrical conductivity. The solid-state SC assembled using ACFs showed a high specific capacitance of 2.55 F cm−3, maximum energy density of 0.35 mW h cm−3, and good mechanical flexibility without a decline in electrochemical performance when subjected to different bending tests. This chemical activation method to produce A-CFTs can be easily scaled up while using an industrial-scale manufacture process. However, the chemical oxidation process needs long times and dangerous concentrated acids. Thus, to solve the abovementioned issues, Lu and co-workers180 reported a simple, one-step electrochemical activation strategy to enhance the SSA of PCF (Fig. 21d–f). After activation, its SSA dramatically increased from 5.5 to 88.4 m2 g−1. The electrode prepared under a potential of 3 V for 10 min exhibited excellent electrochemical performances including high areal capacitance, good rate capability and superb cycling stability. This simple and cost-effective method provides a favorable strategy to design and fabricate high-performance carbon-based electrodes for energy storage devices.

4.3.2. Carbon nanotube fiber substrates. 
CNT fibers composed of CNTs oriented along the axis of the fibers are another important member of carbolic fibers. To date, four main methods had been developed to produce CNT fibers, including wet-spinning from CNT solution, dry-spinning from a vertically aligned CNT array, dry-spinning from a CNT aerogel, and twisting/rolling from a CNT film. Compared with carbon fibers, CNT fibers have a larger specific surface area (SSA) and porous structure, which are beneficial for higher energy storage in constructing flexible SCs. Dalton and co-workers26 fabricated the first fiber-shaped solid-state SC by twisting two gel electrolyte (19% phosphoric acid and 4% polyvinyl alcohol by weight)-coated CNT fibers in 2003. The SC provided a capacitance of 5 F g−1 and an energy density of 0.6 W h kg−1, which is comparable to that of large commercial SCs. Meanwhile, the SC exhibited outstanding long-term cycling durability, where the capacitance exhibited almost no change over 1200 charge/discharge cycles. Although the capacitance was relatively, low limiting its practical application, it provides us a clear direction for the preparation of high performance fiber-shaped SCs. After more than ten years of rapid development, the electrochemical performance of CNT fiber-based SCs have been greatly improved by depositing carbon or pseudocapacitive materials, such as graphene, MnO2 and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). Ren and co-workers181 fabricated a novel multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)/OMC composite fiber, in which MWCNT with high electrical conductivity favors rapid charge separation and transport and ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) with both tunable pore structures and high SSA provides high specific capacitance. The flexible, wire-shaped SC produced by twisting two MWCNT/OMC composite fibers delivered a high specific capacitance (39.7 mF cm−2) and energy density (1.77 × 10−6 W h cm−2). To further improve its electrochemical performance, Pan and co-workers182 constructed all-solid-state asymmetric SCs with a maximum operating voltage of 3.5 V (Fig. 22). Firstly, they grew TiO2 nanowires (NWs) on CNT fibers via a hydrothermal method. Then an MnOx@TiN NW@CNT positive electrode was obtained by annealing TiO2 NW@CNT fiber in ammonia gas and depositing MnOx on it. The C@TiN NW@CNT negative electrode was fabricated by coating glucose on TiO2 NW@CNT fiber and then annealing it in ammonia at 800 °C for 1 h. Finally, an all-solid-state asymmetric SC was successfully assembled by twisting these two electrodes after coating them with EMIMTFSI/PVDF–HFP gel electrolyte. Due to the asymmetric structure and the use of ionic liquid electrolyte, the operating voltage of the SC was successfully extended to 3.5 V, and thus the device exhibited an extremely high energy density of 61.2 mW h cm−3, which is comparable to that of commercial planar lead–acid batteries.

4.3.3. Graphene fiber substrates. 
Graphene fibers formed by individual graphene nanosheets are promising candidates as flexible electrodes because of their advantages of tiny volume, flexibility, lightweight, high strength, and ability to be woven into fabrics.183–186 However, during the preparation, the strong π–π interactions between graphene sheets lead to irreversible agglomeration, which make it difficult to achieve the theoretical specific surface area, and thus maximizing their performance as electrodes is difficult to realize. Therefore, structural design to prepare graphene fibers with porous structures and large SSAs has become an important task to expand their application in flexible SCs.
Zhu and co-workers187 developed a non-liquid crystal method for the continuous preparation of graphene porous fibers. Firstly, the pH of GO was adjusted to 11 with sodium hydroxide, and then porous graphene fibers were successively prepared using acetic acid as the solidification bath and homemade wet-spinning equipment (Fig. 23a). Using this method, we obtained hundreds of meters long graphene fibers, which could be sewn into a fabric (Fig. 23b–d). The formation of pores may be due to the alkalinity of the spinning liquid, which inhibited the ionization of oxygen-containing functional groups in GO, resulting in the inability of GO to form liquid crystals. The destruction of an ordered structure led to the disordered accumulation of GO in the fiber, which resulted in the formation of a porous structure. Due to their high mechanical strength and conductivity, the obtained RGO fibers could be directly employed as flexible electrodes to construct all-solid-state SCs, which possessed a high specific capacitance of 185 F g−1 and energy density of 5.76 W h kg−1. Owing to the outstanding toughness, the device was woven into a fabric, which could power a red LED after being charged, showing potential in the fabrication of wearable electronics (Fig. 23e and f). This work offers a general assembly method for the continuous preparation of macroscopic fibers from various functional two-dimensional materials, not just graphene.

The rational design and fabrication of graphene fibers with optimized three-dimensional (3D) architectures can also avoid restacking.189 Recently, Zhu and co-workers188 fabricated three-dimensional porous carbon nanotube/reduced graphene oxide fibers via a nonsolvent-induced rapid phase separation method followed by hydrazine vapor reduction (Fig. 24). The SSA of the as-fabricated fiber was 404.1 m2 g−1, which is larger than or comparable to the recently reported graphene fiber. Owing to its three-dimensional porous structure, large specific surface area, and high conductivity, the fabricated SC exhibited a high volume capacitance of 54.9 F cm−3 and high energy and power densities (4.9 mW h cm−3 and 15.5 W cm−3, respectively). Remarkably, the SC worked well at a high scan rate of 50 V s−1 and showed a fast frequency response with a short time constant of 78 ms. Furthermore, the fiber-shaped SC also exhibited very stable electrochemical performances when it was subjected to mechanical bending and succeeding straightening process, indicating its great potential application in flexible electronic devices.

Inserting spacers such as nanostructured carbon,188,190–195 conducting polymers196–199 and transition metal oxides200–205 into graphene fiber to expand the layer distance between the individual sheets of graphene is another effective strategy to fabricate porous graphene fibers. Dai and co-workers38 prepared graphene/carbon nanotube hybrid fibers via a size-restricted hydrothermal method, as shown in Fig. 25. The carbon nanotubes formed an effective barrier between the graphene sheets and inhibited the restacking of the graphene sheets, forming a porous structure with an SSA of 396 m2 g−1. Moreover, because the CNT in the fiber formed a conducting network, the conductivity of the fiber reached up to 102 S cm−1. The SCs prepared from this fiber exhibited a high volume specific capacitance, which was 305 F cm−3 (current density 73.5 mA cm−3, three electrodes) in sulfuric acid solution and 300 F cm−3 (current density 26.7 mA cm−3, two electrodes) in PVA/H3PO4 electrolyte, higher than most fiber SCs. Similarly, Liu and coworks206 prepared carbon nanotube/graphene hybrid fibers using non-oxidized SWNTs as an additive. The SCs fabricated using the fibers exhibited a high specific capacitance and energy density of 38.8 F cm−3 and 3.4 mW h cm−3, respectively.

4.4. Fiber-shaped SCs with polymer fiber substrates
According to the electrical conductivity property, polymer fibers can be divided into conductive polymer fibers and traditional non-conductive polymer fibers. For conductive polymer fibers, due to their high conductivity and pseudocapacitance, they can be directly used as flexible electrode materials. However, their complex fabrication process and high fabrication cost limit their practical application in flexible SCs. For traditional non-conductive fibers, although they dominate the general fiber and textile industries, they cannot be used in the field of electronics because of their non-conductivity. However, if they can be transformed into conductive fibers through appropriate strategies without compromising their original properties, their applications in the wearable field will certainly grow rapidly. In the following section, we briefly describe the recent advancements in conductive polymer fibers and their applications in SCs, and then introduce several methods to convert non-conductive polymer fibers into conductive fibers, together with their applications in flexible SCs.

4.4.1. Conducting polymer fiber substrates. 
The development of conducting polymer fibers has played an important role in the realization of electronic textiles due to their inherent electrical conductivity, electrochemical switching and charge storage capabilities.207 These properties coupled with their ability to be produced by a relatively simple wet-spinning technique make them amenable to continuous fiber production.208 Conducting polymer fibers have been used for a wide range of applications such as chemical sensors,209 electrochemical actuators,210 and energy storage electrodes,211 which can be potentially integrated as flexible smart components of multifunctional fabrics. Recently, Wang and co-workers212 fabricated PEDOT:PSS fibers via a wet-spinning process using ethanol/water (3/1, v/v) solution with 3 wt% CaCl2 as the coagulating bath. This fiber was used to construct novel stretchable fiber-shaped SCs with a wide electrochemical window (1.6 V), high energy and power densities (6.6 mW h cm−3 and 320 mW cm−3) and stable cycling performance (89% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles). To further improve the electrochemical performances of PEDOT:PSS fiber SCs, Zhang and co-workers213 fabricated highly conductive MXene/PEDOT:PSS hybrid fibers via a wet-spinning approach (Fig. 26a–h). The FSC constructed using the hybrid fiber with 70 wt% MXene showed a higher volumetric capacitance of 364.4 F cm−3 at 2 mV s−1 and higher energy and power densities of 7.13 W h cm−3 and 8249 mW cm−3, respectively, which can be attributed to the introduction of pseudocapacitance by MXene. The excellent strength and flexibility of the hybrid fibers allowed them to be wrapped on a silicone elastomer fiber (Fig. 26i). The constructed device could achieve a stretchable FSC with 96% capacitance retention at a strain of 100% (Fig. 26j).

4.4.2. Nonconductive polymer fiber substrates. 
Nonconductive polymer fibers cannot be directly used for electrodes in SCs. Currently, there are several ways to convert nonconducting fibers into conducting fibers, including repetitive dip coating and atomic layer deposition (ALD). In the following section, some representative fiber-shaped SCs based on conductive material-modified fibers are introduced according to the modification methods and materials used.
As discussed in the previous sections, carbon materials have many advantages as electrode materials for SCs, such as high conductivity, large surface area and controllable porosity. Therefore, modification with carbon materials not only can improve the conductivity of fibers, but also provide additional capacitance. Numerous carbon-based materials such as activated carbon,214–216 CNTs,78,217–223 and graphene have been used to modify fibers. Jost and co-workers214 fabricated activated carbon material (the most widely used and least expensive electrode material for conventional SCs)-modified cellulose yarns using a natural fiber welding coating process, which could produce hundreds of feet of coated yarn at a time, delivering a consistent mass loading of capacitive material (Fig. 27). The mass of activated carbon embedded in the fiber surface could reach up to about 0.6 mg cm−1. A two-electrode symmetric SC with a length of 6 cm was assembled using the obtained strands of yarn with a single strand of stainless steel yarn as the current collector. The device yielded a capacitance of up to 37 mF cm−1, with a low ESR of 1.5 Ω cm−1. Owing to their good mechanical strength, the yarns could be directly knitted into fabric on a Shima Seiki SSG122SV V-bed knitting machine. This work provides a facile, scalable method for continuously converting nonconductive fibers into conductive fibers.

Previous studies have shown that SWCNTs have strong van der Waals interactions with cotton fibrils.224–226 Therefore, SWCNTs can be coated on the surface of cotton thread via a simple dip coating method, which can give cotton thread certain electrical conductivity without affecting its mechanical property, which meet the requirements for an ideal SC. For example, Liu and co-workers222 developed a three-dimensional polypyrrole (PPy)–MnO2–CNT–cotton thread electrode via a facile and reproducible three-step process. Initially, they coated SWCNTs on porous cotton threads via a multiple dip coating method. After coating, the threads possessed high conductivity with a line resistance of less than 20 Ω cm−1. Subsequently, MnO2 and PPy films were grown on the threads via an electrochemical deposition method. In the hierarchical structure, conducting SWCNT and PPy can provide excellent conductivity, while the active mesoporous flower-like MnO2 nanoplates and PPy conductive wrapping layer can add extra pseudocapacitance. The cable-type SC assembled from the fibers yielded a high areal capacitance of 1.49 F cm−2 at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1, a high areal energy density of 33 μW h cm−2 at a power density of 0.67 mW cm−2, and good cycling stability (87% of the initial capacitance was retained after 2000 cycles).
Metals are the most common conductive materials in daily life. The conductivity of fibers can be improved by depositing a certain amount of metal evenly on their surface through appropriate methods. At present, the main methods to deposit a thin layer of metal on the surface of fibers include galvanic deposition,228 atomic layer deposition (ALD),227,229–231 electrochemical deposition (ECD),232 and electroless deposition (ELD).233–236 ALD with self-limiting and complementary properties can well control the composition and thickness of the deposited film. Thus, it has been widely used to convert nonconductive textile substrates into conductive substrates, such as nylon and polypropylene, via the deposition of high aspect ratio conductive materials (e.g., platinum and tungsten) at low processing temperatures. Daubert and co-workers227 modified pristine Kevlar yarn by coating conductive Pt and pseudocapacitive V2O5via the ALD approach (Fig. 28). Before coating Pt, they firstly deposited 3 nm Al2O3 seed layers on pristine Kevlar yarn to promote Pt nucleation. Then, a 10 nm Pt film could be readily deposited on the Al2O3 layers, and the resultant yarn achieved a high conductivity of 23 500 S m−1. Finally, pseudocapacitive V2O5 was deposited on the outermost layer of the Kevlar yarn, forming an integrated flexible electrode for SCs. The obtained yarn could be knotted well and its tensile strength only decrease by 24%, demonstrating its good coating flexibility and robustness. With high conductivity and mechanical strength, the obtained yarn could be directly assembled into an all-solid-state SC, which provided an areal capacitance of 4.7 mF cm−2. Overall, this work demonstrated that ALD can be used to deposit metals on common textile fabrics to give them certain conductivity, then the conductive fabrics can act as ideal substrates for flexible electronics.

Electroless deposition is a plating method in which metal ions in the plating solution are reduced to metal and deposited on the surface of parts with the aid of an appropriate reducing agent without impressed current. This technology has attracted increasing attention due to its simplicity, energy saving and environmental protection. Compared with electroplating, electroless deposition technology has the characteristics of uniform coating and deposition on a non-conductor, such as chemical fibers and plastics. Liu and co-workers236 designed and fabricated a hierarchical composite electrode consisting of low-cost graphene sheets immobilized on the surface of Ni-coated cotton yarn (Fig. 29a). Firstly, they fabricated Ni-coated cotton yarn via a scalable polymer-assisted electroless deposition method, and 500 m-long Ni-coated cotton yarn was obtained, which was wound on a spinning cone (Fig. 29b). Then graphene was deposited on the surface of the pretreated metallic yarn via electrochemically electrolyzing GO, followed by electrolyzation and hydrazine vapour reduction. The SSA of the yarn increased from 2.77 to 7.11 m2 g−1 after 10 min electrodeposition. The all solid-state SC fabricated using the hybrid yarn (Fig. 29c) exhibited a volumetric energy density of 6.1 mW h cm−3 and good cycle stability (82% of its initial capacitance was retained after 10000 cycles). As a proof-of-concept, an energy storage fabric was woven using the fabricated solid-state SC yarn as weft and warp yarn with other pristine cotton yarn in a conventional weaving process (Fig. 29d). The as-made SC yarn exhibited outstanding mechanical stability, could be bent arbitrarily without degrading its performance. After 4000 folding and unfolding cycles, no obvious change in the surface morphology of the RGO/Ni cotton composite electrode and only 5% decay in volumetric capacitance were observed.

4.5. Fiber-shaped SCs with hybrid conductive fiber substrates
It can be seen from the above discussion that metal fibers and carbon-based fibers have their respective advantages and disadvantages as electrode materials. Hybrid fibers integrate their individual advantages through reasonable structure design, thus making them reliable electrode materials for energy storage application.237–239 Lee and co-workers fabricated a high performance yarn SC using biscrolled PEDOT/MWNT yarn as the working electrode and Pt wire as the current collector.237 PEDOT/MWNT yarn was fabricated from a PEDOT infiltrated nanotube sheet strip by using a modified biscrolling method (Fig. 30a). Then the biscrolled PEDOT/MWNT yarn was plied with a Pt wire current collector to fabricate identical electrodes, which were used as both the anode and cathode (Fig. 30b and c). Solid-state SCs were fabricated by pling these two electrodes precoated with PVA/H2SO4 electrolyte (Fig. 30d). Due to the synergistic effect between the highly conductive platinum fibers and high-capacity PEDOT/MWNT yarn, the fabricated SC exhibited a high capacitance (up to 179 F cm−3), high energy density (1.4 mW h cm−3) and ultrahigh power density (40 W cm−3). Meanwhile the discharge current of the plied yarn SCs linearly increased with the scan rate up to 80 V s−1 and 20 V s−1 for liquid and solid electrolytes, respectively (Fig. 30e). The excellent electrochemical performance is mainly due to the rational design of the structure. Similarly, Wang and co-workers238 fabricated polyaniline nanowire-decorated Pt/CNT hybrid fibers. The yarn SC made from the hybrid fibers possesses a high capacitance of 91.67 mF cm−2 and a high energy density of 12.68 μW h cm−2, and excellent long term cycling stability (80% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles) and flexing deformation.

In summary, fiber-based SCs are one of the promising energy storage devices that have a variety of applications due to their advantage of mechanical flexibility. Different electrode materials have been designed and developed for multifunctional fiber-shaped SCs. The basic compositions and electrochemical properties of typical fiber-shaped SCs reported in the literature are presented in Table 3 with the aim to provide an overall comparison and direct guidance for future research activities.

5. Fiber-shaped batteries
Obviously, SCs can be used as energy storage instruments in some situations owning to their high power density, especially when the receptor immediately needs abundant power to work. In other cases, many devices can be operated in a specific environment with continuous energy support.282–285 Therefore, power sources such as batteries with high energy density have received more attention from researchers.286,287 Batteries possess a long history and different types of batteries have been developed according to the application scenario and cost. The first battery was invented by Volta in the 1800s. It was formed by stacking discs of zinc and copper separated by cloth or cardboard soaked in sodium chloride solution. In the meantime, he predicted the role of the electrode and electrolyte and guided the direction of battery design and assembly.288 Due to the potential gap between the electrodes, the negative electrode can be oxidized, producing a certain number of electrons, which then flow to the positive electrode with the diffusion of ions in the electrolyte. The continuous circulation of ions and electrons ensures the balance of charge and the formation of a current in the external circuit. Fundamentally, a battery is a special device that can store chemical energy and convert it to electric energy by gaining and losing electrons.289 According to this new model, various batteries have been assembled from different electrodes and electrolytes to adapt the use environment and presented a similar working principle to the Volta batteries. For instance, a rechargeable lead acid battery as the first secondary battery was produced in 1859 and is still used in electric motors due to its stable working voltage, wide operation temperature and low price.290 Moreover, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries are the representative secondary batteries and are installed in many portable equipment, such as watches, computers and detectors.291–295 Furthermore, metal ion batteries,296–303 metal air batteries,304–306 metal sulfur batteries,307–309etc. have been assembled from specific electrodes and electrolytes based on their principles.
The abovementioned battery types provide a large range to select suitable candidates for application. After long-term trials, secondary batteries, especially lithium-ion batteries, play an increasingly important role in the portable market owning to their low price per cycle, high energy density and ease of use.310,311 Moreover, many powerful and special batteries, which are employed at low temperatures or high rates, can be customized and produced by designing and conducting high performance electrodes or electrolytes.291,312 Therefore, battery technology has been developed and accumulated fairly, and developed in parallel with the advent of advanced materials (Fig. 31).
 Fig. 31  Brief chronology of battery development from bulk to flexible to smart in the future. 
The convenient battery is always rigid and bulk, which is not suitable to integrate with wearable electronics. At the most basic level, wearable batteries must show a certain degree of flexibility.33 In particular, the battery should withstand mechanical deformation including bending, twisting, and pressure. Moreover, it should be easy to integrate the battery unit into clothing in the wearable system to build a highly efficient circuit. In general, to address the shortcomings of convenient batteries, highly flexible components with similar performances to bulk batteries and novel assembly methods should be exploited to obtain devices that can be easily integrated. Starting from cloth, fibers as the repeating unit with a one-dimensional structure are the most appropriate candidates for flexible batteries. If a battery can be produced in the form of fibers, it can be seamlessly integrated into systems using traditional textile technology by just substituting a non-functional fiber without destroying any intrinsic structure of cloth, which does not generate any unnecessary impact on the application.313 In addition, the prerequisite is that all the elements for assembling a fiber-shaped battery must exhibit obvious flexibility and play the same electrochemical role as in the bulk battery to ensure excellent performance. In this section, we introduce the components of fiber-shaped batteries, including electrodes, electrolytes, and packaging materials, as well as smart designs with high flexibility and integration capabilities.
5.1. Electrodes in fiber-shaped batteries
The electrode is the core element in a battery and plays a vital role in its electrochemical performance. There are many methods that can be used for selecting ideal materials and designing reasonable structures.314,315 In fiber-shaped batteries, a flexible structure as the base will be the most important parameter, which should be considered initially. Firstly, to meet the structure characteristics, electrodes should be processed into one-dimensional macroscopic individual or film profiles for coordinating with the final sealing and possess intrinsic ability to bend. Obviously, many efforts have been paid and proved that the environment around the fiber electrode and resistance show a change under bending by modeling316,317 and impedance tests.318,319 A particular case is that a flexible film could be assembled into fiber-shaped battery by rolling on a conductive base.30 Besides, the electrode must show high flexibility and endure mechanical stress. Secondly, considering how to maintain the electrochemical property of the battery compared with the bulk battery is another issue. In coin cells, the active materials, conductive agent and binder are dispersed in a solvent to form a uniform slurry and then coated on copper or aluminum foil. This is the standard process for fabricating battery electrodes. A specific target is constructing all parts together in a single fiber and each section can correspond with a coin cell. Metal wire or carbon-based fibers can replace the effect of the collector and conductive agent as a path for promising electron movement.320,321 Active materials can be anchored on the conductive network using a binder like in the conventional electrode and covalent or physical interaction under growth or adsorption conditions. Therefore, we classify the electrodes into certain types based on their conductive networks.

5.1.1. Metal wire-based electrodes. 
Similar to SCs, metal fibers can be also used as collectors for batteries. For example, in some cases, the metal plays the role of the collector and active material in addition to an electrode such as in the lead acid battery.322 Cu and Al foil with high conductivity are regarded as the collector in the lithium ion battery, which is a more promising and popular device in the future.323 The more attractive traits of metals applied in wearable devices are their metallurgy and outstanding mechanical property, which can endure deformation and support stress from the movement of the human body. Therefore, employing metal wire as a conductor in wearable devices is a reasonable route to explore.
Je Young Kim and co-workers324 firstly assembled a cable-type lithium-ion battery in 2012. A twisted hollow frame as the anode was prepared by coating Ni–Sn alloy on Cu wire. Then the separator, Al wire and LiCoO2 cathode were coated on the anode surface and finally packaged by insulated plastic. The cable-type lithium-ion battery was fabricated after injecting enough electrolyte (Fig. 32a). The unnecessary fracture on the surface of Cu produced under bending could be solved by adjusting the weight percent of Ni–Sn alloy. The optimized bending stability was achieved at 5 wt% Ni in the Ni–Sn alloy (Fig. 32b and c). Furthermore, the battery could operate an LED screen and Apple player even under severe deformation conditions, which is ascribed to its superior mechanical flexibility (Fig. 32d). The discharge curve still maintained a smooth trend and was similar to that of the pristine battery after suffering from severe bending (Fig. 32e and f). However, the charge and discharge capacity of the cable-shaped battery was nearly 1 mA h cm−1, showing a potential plateau at 3.5 V between 4.2 and 2.5 V at the rate of 0.1C (Fig. 32g). Although the cycle performance of the battery did not reach a similar level to that of the lithium-ion battery, it provided a novel orientation about how to design the structure and coordinate the flexible component for a wearable energy storage device. To improve the safety and decrease the cost, steel-filled polyester thread was chosen as the conductive base. Meanwhile, gel electrolyte was introduced for avoiding the leakage of the liquid electrolyte.325 The all-solid-state fiber-shaped battery attempted to coat different anode materials and match with LiFePO4 as a full cell, which showed a high capacitance, energy density and good durability under all conditions. Based on the above lithium-ion battery, another type of anode was prepared for a different type of battery. For instance, S–TiO2 nanotube arrays grown on Ti fiber possessed excellent performance as a flexible electrode in a sodium ion battery.326

The dual-ion battery, with a special working principle that the cation and anion are inserted in the cathode together, has been proven to possess high energy density, good reversibility and low cost.328–330 Usually, Al and graphite are the typical anode and cathode for a lithium dual ion battery, respectively. Al wire etched by boric acid and phosphoric acid under current could improve the number of pores on the surface and was good for the cycle performance. The existence of pores provided channels for the fast diffusion of electrolyte and enough space for buffering the volume expansion (Fig. 33a and b). The dual-ion battery showed a high capacity, reaching to 130.3 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles at 1C between 3.0–4.95 V, while pristine Al just achieved about 99.4 mA h g−1, which then dropped to 30.5 mA h g−1 after 120 cycles (Fig. 33c and d). Furthermore, the capacity of the porous Al graphite dual-ion battery was still retained at 31 mA h g−1 at 20C (Fig. 33e).

Developing an excellent cathode is also important for performance especially in some novel-type batteries, where pure metal is directly used as the anode. Therefore, the cathode design in structure and size will influence its electrochemical properties deeply. Researchers have paid more attention on traditional cathodes, resulting in numerous achievements.331–333 For a fiber-shaped battery based on a metal electrode, an Li–S battery321 and Li–CO2 battery36 were fabricated. Because of its low cost and high energy density, the lithium–sulfur battery is a candidate for replacing the lithium-ion battery as new energy storage device. Huang and co-workers321 directly prepared RGO–S materials via the hydrothermal method for constructing interaction force and increasing the number of cycles. The HRTEM image of the obtained material showed that S was distributed on uniformly on the surface of RGO without any aggregation. In addition, S was crystalline in nature with an interplanar spacing of 0.22 nm. Then, the active materials could cover the acid-treated stainless steel fibers by capillary action and covered the metal totally (Fig. 33f). The steel RGO–S cathode showed an excellent electrochemical property, reaching 762.5 mA h g−1 at 0.1C (1C = 1675 mA g−1) in the voltage window of 1.8–2.8 V over 100 cycles. Meanwhile, the capacity retention was about 54% when the current density increased from 0.1C to 2C. The outstanding electrochemical performance can be attributed to the synergistic effect between RGO and S and strong interaction the between the steel fiber base and active materials. RGO provided a protective screen for the dissolution of polysulfur and conductive materials between S and the steel.


5.1.2. Carbon fiber-based electrodes. 
Carbon fibers with high conductivity and modulus can be produced using cellulosic fibers and PAN fibers.334 Because of their excellent mechanical performances, carbon fibers can endure various operations including bending, stretching, twisting. Furthermore, compared with metal wire, carbon fibers have a low weight density, which is favorable for assembling lighter devices. However, the surface of carbon fibers is inert and smooth, and thus how to firmly anchor active materials is the most important point. A simple method is anchoring metal oxide on the surface of carbon by electrodeposition and then hydrothermal treatment directly.335 Although metal oxide sheets can stack on the surface, the electrochemical performance does not reach an ideal level due to the unstable interaction between the active materials and conductive base. The metal oxide will break away from the carbon fiber after cycling due to the volume expansion. A good method is building sheet morphology-controlled active materials on the surface of carbon fibers. Lu and co-workers336 reported a novel Ni–NiO nanosheet-anchored carbon fiber electrode (Fig. 34a). The special nanosheets could improve the cycling stability, which resulted in the irreversibility of the Ni-based cathode. When the cathode performance was evaluated in a Zn–NiO battery, the Ni–NiO/carbon fiber exhibited an excellent reversible capacity in aqueous electrolyte (about 96% capacity retention after 10000 cycles) and polymer (no capacity attenuation after 10000 cycles at 22.2 A g−1), rate capacity (237.8 μA h cm−3 at 3.7 A g−1 and 74.4% capacity retention in at 37 A g−1) and high energy density (6.6 μW h cm−2) and power density (20.2 mW cm−2) (Fig. 34b and e). The superior property in the battery could be attributed to the metal Ni doped in the NiO nanosheets based on the XRD pattern (Fig. 34c). The EIS tests showed remarkable conductivity, fast ion diffusion and high electrolyte penetration (Fig. 34d).

To increase the interaction between the active materials and carbon fiber, using a part conductive polymer as a binder337 and functional carbon fiber surface containing enough oxygen-containing group338 are common methods. Mai and co-workers placed the carbon fiber in concentrated nitric acid as the active surface. Carbon cloth–ZnO@C–Zn as the anode and branch-like Co(CO3)0.5(OH)x·0.11H2O@CoMoO4 grown on carbon cloth as the cathode were used to assemble a Zn–Co battery, which presented a stable cycling performance and outstanding energy density (235 W h kg−1) and power density (12.6 kW kg−1), ascribing to the restrained formation of Zn dendrites and nanowire morphology of the cathode (Fig. 34f).
Further, taking full advantage of their inner space for active materials is another recommended method to optimize the structure of carbon fibers. Xia and co-workers339 selected porous carbon fibers as the raw materials and then put enough NiS2 nanoparticles into their confined pores. The EDX mapping presented the uniform distribution of NiS2 in the carbon fiber (Fig. 34g). Compared with the common carbon fibers, it improved the surface area and space utilization, obviously leading to a more stable interaction between the conductive network and active materials. Additionally, loading more materials in a porous carbon base was beneficial for the high capacity and excellent reversibility. Consequently, the evaluation of a sodium ion battery presented a capacity of 679 mA h g−1 at 0.1C, superior rate capability (245 mA h g−1 at 10C), and stable cycle performance (76% capacity retention over 5000 cycles at 5C). However, the NiS2 grown on the carbon fiber surface just showed the mass capacity of about 418.9 mA h g−1 at 0.1C and lower rate capacity of 43 mA h g−1 at 2C (Fig. 34h and i). Under different bending angles, the fiber-shaped sodium ion battery could drive an LED constantly and exhibited an outstanding cycling performance.
Carbon fibers are a desired base for loading the catalyst in metal air batteries owning to their loose structure, allowing fast gas diffusion in the electrode. Co3O4/N–RGO composites can be fabricated via hydrothermal reaction. Benefitting from its high surface area, synergistic effect and mesoporous structure, the zinc–air battery presented a better electrochemical property compared with the RuO2/Pt electrode. More importantly, the battery exhibited a high volume energy density, reaching 36.1 mW h cm−3.340


5.1.3. Carbon nanotube fiber-based electrodes. 
Carbon nanotube fibers with an inert surface possess similar characteristics as carbon fibers. Therefore, they should be designed to combine the active materials together with the fibers.29 Initially, Si could be deposited on the surface of carbon nanotubes through electron beam evaporation technology.341 After yarning the carbon nanotube film, a fiber-shaped CNT–Si electrode could be fabricated. The carbon nanotube was the skeleton in the electrode, which was beneficial for transferring the electrode and supporting its structure. After 50 cycles, the capacity of the CNT–Si fiber decreased from 1600 mA h g−1 to 1000 mA h g−1. In similar method, constructing a layer-by-layer structure could enhance the cycle performance obviously. The CNT–Si film and CNT film successively protected the volume expansion of silicon (Fig. 35a). Then the sandwiched film turned into a fiber under scrolling. In a lithium ion battery, the electrode showed a capacity of 2240 mA h g−1 at 0.1C with 88% capacity retention, while the pure CNT–Si fiber just exhibited 42% retention (Fig. 35b).342

Stretchable devices can be used in various conditions and change length under the strain force, while still maintaining a stable performance. However, for most stretchable devices, they need a polymer as an additive or base, which will increase their volume or weight in most cases, leading to a decrease in energy density based on the whole device. Additionally, polymers show a poor mechanical property in too high or low temperature. A spring-like carbon nanotube fiber electrode with a coiled loop appearance was fabricated via twisting aligned multi-wall carbon nanotubes, which guaranteed high stretchability (Fig. 35c).39 The carbon nanotube could cover and contact the active materials in the pristine and stretching condition. Furthermore, this special structure could wrap the active materials into the fiber, controlling the volume expansion and providing continuous paths for electrolyte diffusion due to the capillary effect. Finally, the full cell assembled using CNT/LiMn2O4 and CNT/Li4Ti5O12 presented a capacity of 145.9 mA h g−1 at 0.1 mA cm−1. The battery could run at the elongation of 300%, retained a capacity of about 85% under 100% strain and rarely varied for 300 times cycles at 50% strain.
To improve the activity on the surface of carbon nanotube fibers, physical treatment is necessary. After pretreatment by O2 plasma, MOF,344,345 metal oxide346 and metal nitride343 could be grown on carbon nanotube fibers via the hydrothermal method. TiN@V2O5/CNTF could be fabricated via the hydrothermal method following nitrogenization for a zinc ion battery, which showed a high capacity (1.45 mA h cm−2 at 0.5 mA cm−2), outstanding rate capability (1.11 mA h cm−2 at 10 mA cm−2) and excellent cycling property (90.6% capacity retention after 3500 cycles) (Fig. 35d and e). The superior performance could be attributed to the highly conductive TiN core and synergetic effect between TiN and V2O5.


5.1.4. Graphene fiber-based electrodes. 
As a conductor or active material, graphene has been widely used in energy storage devices.347–349 Firstly, because of its similar structure with the graphite, graphene can react with metal ions, and thus considered as an active material. Taking the lithium-ion battery as an example, lithium ions can insert into the graphene sheet and complex with carbon atoms, leading to a larger layer distance. Only half the number of lithium ions belongs to layer graphene in graphite, while graphene possesses all the lithium ions, which are located on the surface of every sheet. Therefore, theoretically, the capacity of graphene is twice that of graphite.350,351 Secondly, most high-performance active materials will experience volume expansion and shrink during the charge and discharge process. Graphene can buffer the volume change and keep an excellent conductive network in the electrode.352,353 Therefore, graphene sheets are flexible and conductive sheets and present an obvious phenomenon promoting the electrochemical property of metal oxides, silicon, metal sulfides, etc.
Although graphene as a conductive and active material shows many advantages in batteries, it is a challenge to fabricate graphene fibers from graphene sheets. A typical method is preparing GO fibers, and then reducing them to RGO fibers. Specifically, the units in RGO fibers are reduced graphene oxide, which still contain abundant oxygen-containing functional groups and possess lower conductivity compared with graphene.9,357 When RGO fibers become an active material in the lithium-ion battery, the most important problem that should be solved is the π–π interaction between the sheets during the wet spinning process, leading to unnecessary stacking, which will result in more reactive sites being covered. Thus, we added carbon nanotubes to an aqueous solution of GO to decorate the surface of GO by π–π interactions in advance.354 The GO sheets acted as a surfactant and dispersed the carbon nanotubes uniformly in water. When the spinning solution was injected into the coagulation bath, the stacking between two adjacent sheets could be prevented by the carbon nanotubes and the layer distance increased obviously (Fig. 36a and b). Finally, the RGO–CNT fiber showed a higher capacity compared with the RGO fiber at the same current density. Also, the rate capacity of the RGO–CNT fiber was higher than that of RGO (Fig. 36c). The difference in capacity between the two fibers could be attributed to the change in layer distance, leading to the exposure of more active sites for the electrolyte and more channels for the diffusion of lithium ions. Compared with one-dimensional carbon nanotubes, Ag nanowires did not show an apparent increase in capacity, implying that interaction between the additive and GO sheets is a critical parameter for the fabrication of the structure. Similarly, adding a two-dimensional component for constructing a layer-by-layer structure in fibers is an excellent idea for buffering the volume expansion. TiO2 sheets could be prepared via an exfoliation process. GO and TiO2 sheets arrayed regularly under the high shear force in wet spinning (Fig. 36d).355 The anode presented a capacity of 126 mA h g−1 and still retained 70% after 100 cycles at 0.0085 mA (Fig. 36e). In addition, together with the cathode, the full cell could support an LED light for about 3.5 h and worked under different bending conditions.

Graphene fibers can be applied as electrodes in the lithium–sulfur battery. Graphene sheets could adsorb the polysulfur on the surface to achieve a high surface area and improve the migration rate of electrons for high conductivity.358,359 An important requirement is the pretreatment of S and carbon materials for further enhancing their conductivity.360 S could be anchored on the surface of CNT via the melt diffusion method. Then the obtained composites will mix with GO in DMF. A gel fiber could be obtained in rotating ethyl acetate as the coagulation bath. After reduction by HI vapor, the CNT/S intercalated uniformly between RGO sheets. An RGO/CNT/S cathode was obtained, which showed a high initial capacity of 1255 mA h g−1 at C/20 and a capacity of 416 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. When the current density increased from 0.1 to 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5C the cathode presented a discharge capacity of 700, 563, 437 and 313 mA h g−1, respectively. In another work, CNT was substituted by graphene to further improve the cycle performance (Fig. 36f).356 The initial capacity was 713 and 819 mA h g−1 for the RGO/RGO/S and RGO/CNT/S hybrid fibers, respectively. However, after 100 cycles, RGO/RGO/S still maintained a capacity of 524 mA h g−1, whereas that of RGO/CNT/S decreased to 326 mA h g−1. Thus, these results indicate that graphene has a higher ability for anchoring S (Fig. 36g and h).


5.1.5. Film-based electrodes. 
The flexibility of films increases with a decrease in their thickness. The excellent flexibility of thin films allow their easy adhesion to other electrodes. Carbon nanotube sheets possess a high conductivity of 102–103 S cm−1, porous structure, high mechanical strength in the order of 102–103 MPa and high surface area.30 CNT can sheets easily cover the fiber-shaped electrode as another electrode or conductive network, which can build a porous structure, allowing to the fast diffusion of gas, electrons and electrolyte. Peng and co-workers361 assembled a flexible zinc air battery using zinc wire, gel electrolyte and carbon nanotube films directly. The battery exhibited an excellent cycling performance and maintained stable properties under bending conditions. The cathode layer could be winded by two methods for changing the array of carbon nanotubes and influencing the diffusion of air (Fig. 37a). When the aligned carbon nanotubes showed higher angles between neighboring sheets, the discharge voltage plateaus were enhanced (Fig. 37b and c). Furthermore, a moderate layer number was closely related with the voltage (Fig. 37d).

To improve the interaction between the catalyst and carbon nanotube, electrochemical pretreatment was applied to activate the surface of the fiber, followed by N doping via the hydrothermal method, leading to a dual-doped carbon nanotube.362 Then NiCo2O4 nanosheets could grow in situ on the freestanding film, resulting in the formation of NiCo2O4/N–O carbon nanotube composites (Fig. 37e). According to the SEM image, the porous nanosheets were anchored on the carbon nanotube homogeneously (Fig. 37f). The Zn–air battery presented a high operating potential (≈1.2 V at 0.25 mA cm−2) (Fig. 37g).
Besides metal air batteries, carbon nanotube films are also employed as supporting materials for metal ion batteries.363–365 Liu and co-workers stacked commercial Li4Ti5O12 and LiCoO2 as anode and cathode materials and carbon nanotube film as current collector for high energy density, respectively. Because of its lower density compared with metal foil, the obtained fiber-shaped battery presented a high energy density of 215 mW h cm−3, which is the highest performance reported to date. The performance of fiber-shaped batteries with different electrodes is presented in Table 4.

5.2. Electrolyte in fiber-shaped batteries
The electrolyte is another important part in a battery, which acts as the medium in the discharging and charging process. To adapt to the different situations and improve the performance, an increasing number of electrolytes have been invented such as liquid-based electrolytes,377,378 polymer-based electrolytes,379–382 solid electrolytes,383,384 and aqueous electrolytes.385,386 In addition to the impact on electrochemistry, safety is the most important consideration, especially in wearable systems. Initially, imitating the commercial battery, organic electrolyte was used for fiber-shaped batteries.341 The electrode was put into the heat shrink tube parallelly. Then the electrolyte was injected into the tube and sealed with glue. However, the toxic and flammable organic electrolyte is a potential risk to human skin. When the battery sustains pressure from the movement of the body, it results in the cracking of the package materials, and the leaked electrolyte can etch the skin badly and even cause fire due to short circuit. The aqueous electrolyte of metal sulfate is widely applied for highly safe batteries. Peng and co-workers assembled a flexible aqueous lithium-ion battery370 and sodium-ion battery34via the same method (Fig. 38a). Based on a carbon nanotube fiber electrode, the lithium-ion battery showed a high power density of 10217.74 W kg−1 and energy density of 48.93 W h kg−1, while the sodium-ion battery exhibited an energy density of 25.7 mW h cm−3 at a specific power density of 0.054 W cm−3. Besides the aqueous electrolyte, a polymer-based gel electrolyte was prepared by mixing gelatin powder and KOH solution at 60 °C under magnetic stirring for about 30 min.28 After coating on the electrode, the polymer-based electrolyte could be formed after cooling in a refrigerator. Although the ionic conductivity of polymer gel electrolytes is lower than that of liquid electrolytes, resulting in a weaker electrochemical performance, no leakage is a more important parameter for flexible devices (Fig. 38b).

High temperature is a common cause of battery fire owing to volatile and flammable solvents. Therefore, ionic liquids with high thermal stability can be used as additives for gel electrolytes (Fig. 38c).371 Because of their high wide electrochemical windows and low vapor pressures, the lithium air battery could work under 140 °C with 10 A g−1 for 380 cycles. Aiming to decrease the risk of fire under short circuit, a functional gel polymer electrolyte was prepared.389 LiTFSI was mixed with TEGDME to form solution A, PVDF–HFP was dissolved in NMP to obtain homogeneous and viscous solution B, and HMPP was added to TMPET to form solution C. Finally, the abovementioned three solutions were mixed and irradiated with UV light for 15 s to form a gel polymer electrolyte.36 When using this electrolyte at high temperature, the possibility to catch fire was reduced compared with traditional TEGDME-based liquid electrolyte (Fig. 38d). In addition, the electrolyte was superior in preventing the penetration of moisture, which usually causes the corrosion of metal in lithium air batteries.387 The contact angle of water on the gel electrolyte reached 98.8°, further proving the hydrophobicity of the electrolyte. When the fiber-shaped battery was immersed into water for more than 5 h, it could still power a light (Fig. 38e). Therefore, the novel electrolyte provides a possibility for use in washable devices.
It is difficult to develop a highly stretchable gel electrolyte with high ionic conductivity for fiber-shaped batteries. Zhi and co-workers388 fabricated an alkaline-tolerant hydrogel electrolyte based on sodium polyacrylate and cellulose for a zinc air battery. The electrolyte could stretch about 1000% after immersion in 6 M KOH solution, providing an ionic conductivity of 0.28 S cm−1 (Fig. 38f). After assembling, the fiber-shaped battery could stretch to 500% and showed an enhanced electrochemical performance compared with the initial situation. The excellent flexibility and stretchability are ascribed to the interaction of cellulose and MBAA based on hydrogen bond cross-linking. Meanwhile, the carboxylate ions on AA and the OH− on cellulose provided sufficient alkaline molecules in the channel, and thus ensured high ionic conductivity.
5.3. Assembling methods in fiber-shaped batteries
To date, different assembling methods have been proposed to develop fiber-shaped batteries (Table 5). Packaging is the final step for a fiber-shaped battery. Leakproofness directly determines the performance of a battery. This is because most metal anodes, such as lithium and sodium, and electrolytes are sensitive to moisture and oxygen, leading to unnecessary side reactions. However, owning to its special structure, the fiber-shaped battery should not only ensure impermeability to water, but also array the electrode and electrolyte reasonably to prevent short circuit. Typically, the fiber-shaped electrode could be insert into tubes parallelly separated by a separator372 or gel electrolyte.39 This type of structure is suitable for metal ion batteries, which is similar with the commercial lithium-ion battery. Due to the flexible characteristic, the parallel fiber-shaped electrode can twist together before coating the gel electrolyte.259 Essentially, twisting type is the same as the parallel type. However, a helical structure can decrease the length of the fiber-shaped battery, and thus it can improve the line capacity. Winding-type assembly could improve the stretching ability.373 Firstly, two parallel fiber-shaped electrodes are fixed at one side of a motor. Enough distance between two electrodes was retained to prevent the short circuit. The motor rotated the electrode steadily on an elastic fiber. The super stretchy battery showed the record strain of 600%. In addition, the electrode did not contain any elastic materials, which ensured the superior electrochemical property.

The coaxial structure has been popularly applied in fiber-shaped batteries. One coaxial structure is a fiber-shaped electrode winding on the electrolyte when the metal anode is the core.29 The other type is a film as the electrode.31,390 Because of its inharmonious structure, the film can just scroll around the outside as the electrode for the fiber-shaped battery. Especially for metal air batteries, the film can provide more porous networks for the diffusion of gas. It is also a wonderful design to introduce a film in the fiber-shaped battery. A special method to fabricate a fiber-shaped battery is co-drawing metal and polymer for the direct construction of the skeleton.391 The molten polymer as the jacket can be drawn with metal as the electrode from a special machine. After injecting the electrolyte, the fiber-shaped battery can be used under various bending conditions. This provides an easy method, easy to integration with low cost to fabricate fiber-shaped batteries and can be applied for their large-scale production in industry.
In summary, obviously, the model and concept have been built for fiber-shaped batteries. According to the requirements of the battery, specific electrodes, electrolytes and packaging methods have been developed to satisfy wearable energy storage systems. To date, different types of fiber-shaped batteries have been assembled based on the structure of bulk batteries, showing excellent electrochemical performances. In addition, to improve the battery performance, various efforts have been made to prepare functional and modified units in batteries. In fact, we can directly introduce the technology of electrolyte from bulk batteries. However, we should pay more attention to 1D electrodes and especially their packaging methods. Many methods can be used to assemble fiber-shaped batteries, but may result in non-standardization, which makes it difficult to compare the electrochemical performances indistinguishably.
6. Fiber-shaped energy conversion and storage integrated devices
As aforementioned, fiber-shaped energy conversion devices can convert mechanical or solar energy into electricity, and energy storage devices can store the electrical energy for subsequent use. The fiber form gives the device excellent flexibility, easy integration and light weight, making it ideal for wearable applications. Currently, efficiently connecting fiber-shaped energy conversion and storage devices is still a challenge. The direct connection of these fibers via external wires may lose the flexibility of the fiber devices. Although the device structures and working mechanisms are different, the conductive fiber bases are often interchangeable. Thus, the energy harvesting and energy storage functions may be properly integrated into a single device via smart design, which reduces the material usage and avoids the wiring process.
Recently, Liu and co-workers393 reported a self-charging power textile interwoven by a yarn-based energy-harvesting TENG and energy-storing fiber-shaped asymmetric SCs (Fig. 39). Highly conductive modified polyester yarns were obtained via the ELD of Ni, and subsequent electrodeposition of Cu, which could be directly utilized as current collectors in all-solid-state fiber-shaped asymmetric SCs, as schematically shown in Fig. 39a. The yarn SC was assembled from a negative yarn electrode, which was obtained through hydrothermal self-assembled rGO/CNT coating and a positive electrode obtained through electroplated Ni–Co bimetallic oxyhydroxide coating. The all solid-state asymmetric SCs exhibited excellent electrochemical properties, including high areal energy and power density, stable cycling performance, and excellent flexibility. Meanwhile the device could be incorporated into a common textile, demonstrating its practical application in wearable electronics, as shown in Fig. 39a. To obtain an integrated self-charging power textile, a flexible TENG fabric was fabricated by directly using the as-prepared highly conductive Cu-coated polyester yarn as the conductive electrode and surface fluorination treated PDMS as the electrification layer (Fig. 39b). The working mechanism of the TENG cloth is schematically illustrated in Fig. 39b, which is based on triboelectrification and electrostatic induction. The TENG yarn could deliver a high peak areal power density of 127 mW m−2 and showed high flexibility, and could be woven into common fabrics. A self-charging power textile was assembled by bridging the TENG yarns and asymmetric SC yarns using a rectifier, in which the asymmetric SCs could be charged by the TENG cloth (Fig. 39c).

Besides harvesting mechanical energy, photovoltaic devices can also realize energy conversion effectively by converting irradiation from the sun into usable electricity. Zhang and co-workers,394 for the first time, developed a flexible “energy fiber” by integrating photovoltaic conversion (PC) and energy storage (ES) on a single fiber (Fig. 40a). Its structure is schematically shown in Fig. 40b. As shown in Fig. 40c, the “energy fiber” could realize a self-powering process. After self-charging by PC, the ES process could discharge the stored energy at a very fast current of 0.1 μA (Fig. 40d). The energy storage efficiency in the ES part approached 65.6%. Due to the coaxial structure, the “energy fibers” showed outstanding stability under various bending states. The designed device could simultaneously convert solar energy to electric energy and store the electric energy, which may open a new avenue to future photoelectronics and electronics.

7. Conclusion and outlook
The rapid development in smart garments has aroused great interest in smart and functional fibers. Functional fibers yield advanced fiber-shaped devices, including energy devices, sensors, and medical devices. For example, fiber-shaped energy conversion and storage devices show great advantages over traditional bulk devices, including but not limited to light weight and easy integration. Generally, the development of functional fibers is the key step for making fiber-shaped devices, while electrical conductivity is the basic requirement for functional fibers used in energy-related devices. However, traditional polymer fibers are usually non-conductive. Adding conductive components, such as metal, carbon-based materials and conductive polymers, to the fiber matrix is an effective method to realize conductive fibers. Another strategy is directly assembling conductive materials into continuous macroscopic fibers. Other active materials can also be incorporated into conductive fibers to form multifunctional conductive fibers, which are the basic units in constructing fiber-shaped energy conversion and storage devices.
We summarized the main fiber-shaped energy conversion and storage devices, including nanogenerators, solar cells, supercapacitors, batteries, and their integrated devices. PENG and TENG were discussed in fiber-shaped nanogenerators. Active materials and operation modes were also highlighted. Fiber-shaped solar cells such as DSCs, OSCs, PSCs and QDSCs were summarized based on their electrode materials and structure design. Although solid-state solar cells are more appealing, their energy conversion efficiency still needs to be improved. Fiber-shaped energy storage devices such as supercapacitors and batteries can store electricity via electrochemical reaction. Electrode materials and electrolyte were briefly summarized. Finally, considering wearable applications, the need to integrate energy conversion and storage devices into a fiber form was suggested.
Although great progress has been made in the past two decades, several challenges remain in the future research of fiber-shaped energy conversion and storage devices. (1) The power capacity of fiber-shaped energy-related devices is still lagging behind that of bulk devices. Extending the length and diameter are the main strategy to increase their energy conversion and storage capacity. However, increasing the size of fiber-shaped devices is often accompanied with performance deterioration due to the increased electrical resistance of electrodes and the distance for ion transport. The other method is assembling the small-size fiber device units into large and stacked devices. However, wiring is a huge engineering issue and rarely mentioned to date. (2) There is no uniform standard for the performance evaluation of fiber-shaped energy related devices, such as mechanical flexibility and fiber mass/volume/area calculation method. Without a uniform test standard, it is impossible to reasonably compare the data reported in different studies. (3) Pushing lab-devices to industry products is vital for fiber-shaped devices. The sustainable mass production of fiber electrodes, device assembly, and integration with other electronic components are the keys to ensure stable performance. At present, CNT and graphene fibers are still in the laboratory stage, which leads to some differences in the properties of fibers prepared between batches and affects their performance stability. Thus, industrialization of CNT and graphene fibers is the prerequisite for their practical applications in fiber-shaped energy storage and conversion devices. (4) Safety is undoubtedly the most critical issue for the application of fiber-shaped energy storage and conversion devices in smart textiles. Currently, most research focus on the performance improvement of the electrode, while the subsequent packaging technology has received little attention. For fibrous energy storage devices, corrosive chemicals such as acid, alkali and ionic liquids are often used as the electrolyte, which should be effectively encapsulated, otherwise, these toxic chemicals may leak and pose a safety hazard in practical applications. (5) The functions in a single fiber device are still limited to one or two. Thus, the integration of more functional units into a single fiber is necessary for complex application scenarios. The current research on functional fibers and fiber-based devices mainly focuses on how to improve the performance of a single device and its integration feasibility in clothing. However, simple integrated systems often show a limited range of applications. Therefore, it is recommended to design and construct highly integrated fiber devices, combining energy management, structural energy storage, and electrochemical energy storage on a single fiber to achieve more efficient energy storage and conversion.
Gazing into the future, the field of fiber-based energy conversion and storage devices provides researchers from various backgrounds opportunities to explore novel and interesting concepts and designs. In addition to wearable applications, further attention should be paid to the implantable and recyclable functions of fiber-shaped devices. Moreover, using human body fluids to power implantable electronics is an interesting point of view for fiber-shaped devices. Fiber-shaped sensors and computing devices should be intelligently designed to realize human–machine interaction and artificial intelligence. The next generation of structure–function integrated fiber-based devices are prospected (Fig. 41). Together with the technical breakthroughs in fiber-based energy storage and conversion systems, we believe that in the near future, novel devices that can change the current lifestyle of mankind will appear in our daily lives.
 Fig. 41  Table showing the fiber history for energy conversion and storage. The typical fiber structure, working schematic, working mechanism, advantages and disadvantages of natural fiber, synthetic fiber and fiber-based devices are summarized from the top to bottom. In this development process, the fibers for energy storage and conversion become more and more controlled, designed, efficient and smart. For natural fiber and synthetic fibers, the main working mechanism is based on thermal management, whereas fiber-based devices focus on electricity conversion and storage. In the future, smarter fibers that combine these two mechanisms will be fabricated and show bright prospects in energy conversion and storage.

 	Fig. 41  Table showing the fiber history for energy conversion and storage. The typical fiber structure, working schematic, working mechanism, advantages and disadvantages of natural fiber, synthetic fiber and fiber-based devices are summarized from the top to bottom. In this development process, the fibers for energy storage and conversion become more and more controlled, designed, efficient and smart. For natural fiber and synthetic fibers, the main working mechanism is based on thermal management, whereas fiber-based devices focus on electricity conversion and storage. In the future, smarter fibers that combine these two mechanisms will be fabricated and show bright prospects in energy conversion and storage.
