    , Accepted 6th September 2016First published on 7th September 2016AbstractTuning the band alignment is proved to be an effective way to facilitate carrier transportation and thus enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells. Doping the compact layer with metal ions or modifying the interfaces among functional layers in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) can appreciably improve the PCE of PSCs. Inspired by the rare earth elemental doping of TiO2, which has witnessed the success in photocatalysis and dye-sensitized solar cells, we firstly demonstrated here that La3+ doping in the mesoporous TiO2 layer of a mesostructured PSC can tune its Fermi level and thus significantly enhance the device PCE. Systematic analysis reveals that doping La3+ into TiO2 raises the Fermi level of TiO2 through scavenging oxygen and inducing vacancies, which subsequently increases the open circuit voltage and the fill factor while reducing the series resistance of the PSC using La3+-doped TiO2 as a mesoporous layer. As a result, a PCE of 15.42% is achieved, which is appreciably higher than the PCE of a device with undoped TiO2 (12.11%).
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells have been attracting increasing attention over the past few years due to the astonishing rise in their power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% to over 21.0%.1–12 Such rapid breaking of the world record PCE is largely attributed to the unique properties of the perovskite absorber: large absorption coefficient for efficient light harvesting, high carrier mobility, long charge carrier lifetimes and diffusion lengths, and adjustable band gaps.6,13–20
In the architecture of most solar cells including PSCs, the electron transport layer (ETL) is an indispensable component, which plays the dual roles of transporting electrons and blocking holes. Therefore, appropriate choice of the ETL is vital in improving the overall performance of the PSCs. To date, TiO2 has been the most common ETL material among the PSCs, pushing the PCE to a record of 22.1% through various material and structure optimizations.21 However, the unfavourable conduction band offset is still one of its dissatisfactory features, which prevents photogenerated electrons from the PSC film to the TiO2 electron acceptor electrode. To correct this flaw, nowadays, a number of efforts have already demonstrated that doping has a major effect on the band structure and trap states of TiO2, which in turn affects its important properties such as the conduction band energy, charge transport, recombination and collection in solar cells. For instance, Yttrium-doped TiO2 was utilized as an effective compact layer in PSCs with a high PCE of 19.3%, which enhanced the electron extraction and transport owing to a slight upward shift of the Fermi energy while avoiding excessive interface recombination;22 niobium-doped TiO2 which was exploited as the compact layer, reduced the interfacial electron transfer resistance and facilitated electron transport conspicuously in PSCs. This n-type dopant was anticipated to improve the conductivity of the amorphous TiO2via substitution of Ti4+ by Nb5+ which was expected to create donor centers;23 aluminum-doped TiO2, which was applied to dye-sensitized and perovskite solar cells, had increased the device efficiencies and significantly enhanced the operational device stability under an inert atmosphere due to having a striking impact upon the density of sub-gap states and enhancing the conductivity by orders of magnitude.24
In addition to the above mentioned dopants, rare earth elements, which provide interesting optical and electronic properties due to their unfilled 4f shell,25 have also widely been used to dope TiO2 in the DSSCs and photocatalysis field.26–29 In particular, interest in lanthanum has rapidly increased because of its high binding strength to oxygen, thus scavenging oxygen and inducing vacancies on the surface of TiO2, when La3+ is doped into TiO2. However, despite the inherent excellent properties of lanthanides, lanthanide-doped TiO2 has not yet been used for PSCs, especially for the mesoporous TiO2 layer which so far has scarcely been explored. In this work, we used the La-doped TiO2 (La/TiO2) nanocomposite as the mesoporous layer for PSCs, resulting in a significant performance improvement compared to the undoped TiO2 nanocomposite and achieving a PCE of 15.42% under an illuminating area of 0.16 cm2. Based on the results of XRD, SEM, UV and UPS, we concluded that the influence of La3+ on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs could be attributed to the upward shift of the Fermi energy of La-doped TiO2. Accordingly, with respect to undoped TiO2, our La-doped TiO2 with a low work function not only improved the open circuit voltage, but also reduced the series resistance and increased the fill factor, thus leading to significant enhancement of the device performance.
The La/TiO2 nanocomposite was prepared from TiO2 P25 via a wet approach (ESI†). A control undoped TiO2 was also prepared in parallel except for nonaddition of a La source. The XRD patterns of undoped TiO2 and La/TiO2 are shown in Fig. 1(a). It can be seen that both samples exhibit diffractions from anatase and rutile phases as expected from P25. Although there are slight changes in the peak intensities after the ion modification, lanthanum oxide diffraction peaks are not observed in Fig. 1(a) which may be due to its low loading. The crystallite sizes of the doped and undoped nanocomposites were estimated from the Scherrer equation on the strongest diffraction peak of anatase (101). TiO2 and La/TiO2 nanocomposites show the crystallite sizes of 20.7 nm and 22.8 nm, respectively. Therefore, XRD indicated that the crystallinity of the TiO2 nanocomposite was not changed after the doping of lanthanum. Fig. 1(b) provides the Raman spectra of the undoped TiO2 and La/TiO2 nanocomposites. The Raman signals at 144, 197, 399, 513, 519 and 639 cm−1 can be well assigned to the vibration modes ascribed to the symmetries Eg1, Eg2, B1g, A1g + B1g and Eg3 in anatase.30 Moreover, it should be noted that the additional peaks at 446 cm−1 in the Raman spectra should be attributed to the rutile phase, consistent with the XRD results. The inset in Fig. 1(b) shows the normalized Eg1 vibration signals. The Raman shift to a higher wavenumber by approximately 2 cm−1 on the La/TiO2 nanocomposite corroborates the incorporation of La in TiO2. The TEM images in Fig. 1(c and d) show that the particle size of La/TiO2 is between 20 and 30 nm. The energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping (Fig. 1e–h) clearly indicates that the La/TiO2 nanocomposite is composed of Ti, O and La elements which are distributed uniformly in the entire sample. The quantitative analysis shows that the La content is 1.04 wt%.

SEM was further used to characterize the morphology of TiO2 and La/TiO2. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), similar flat films can be obtained by spin-coating, indicating that La doping does not affect the morphology of mesoporous layers in the devices. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) topography images in Fig. S1† corroborate that TiO2 (a) and La/TiO2 (b) films have minor differences in the surface flatness. The root-mean-square (RMS) values of the surface roughness are 39.0 nm and 41.9 nm for TiO2 and La/TiO2 films, respectively. The UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra (UV-Vis DRS) recorded on TiO2 and La/TiO2 mesoporous layers are shown in Fig. S2.† It can be seen that the absorption edges of La/TiO2 slightly shift to the higher wavelength in the UV region relative to TiO2, indicating more visible light absorption by La/TiO2 than undoped TiO2 which is favourable for PSC application. Fig. 2(c) and (d) show the extrapolated plots of (αhν)2vs. hν which were obtained from the absorption spectra of TiO2 and La/TiO2 and used to obtain their band gaps. The Eg of the TiO2 nanocomposite is 3.65 eV while that of La/TiO2 is 3.62 eV, suggesting that the La doping results in a decrease of 0.03 eV in the forbidden band width of TiO2. Usually, lanthanum ion doping may cause a high concentration of oxygen vacancy which could result in a red shift of the absorption band.

La/TiO2 and undoped TiO2 were subsequently used to fabricate PSCs with a conventional mesostructure. Fig. 3(a) shows a schematic diagram of the device structure with a conventional mesostructured PSC configuration. Fig. 3(b) exhibits the typical cross-sectional SEM image of a mesostructured perovskite solar cell. SEM images (Fig. S3†) of the perovskite films prepared on the doped and undoped TiO2 mesoporous layers show that La doping did not affect the surface morphologies of the perovskite films. The photovoltaic performances of PSCs are measured under standard AM 1.5G solar illumination and the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves are recorded. The J–V curves of the best device fabricated with La/TiO2 and undoped TiO2 and the PCE statistics on a basis of 14 devices in each case are plotted in Fig. 3(c) and (d), respectively. The photovoltaic parameters for each cell are summarized in Table 1. It can be seen that PSCs based on La/TiO2 exhibit significantly better performance compared with undoped TiO2. Comparing the best device in each case, the series resistance of La/TiO2-PSC reduced from 9.18 to 6.05 Ω cm2; and the VOC and FF increased from 1.00 V to 1.05 V and 60.01 to 68.92%, respectively. Moreover, the JSC increased from 20.28 mA cm−2 to 21.30 mA cm−2 in the La/TiO2-PSC. As a result, the best La/TiO2-PSC shows a PCE of 15.42%, which is 27.3% higher than that of the best TiO2-PSC (12.11%). As shown in Fig. 3(d), the statistics analysis confirmed that almost all the tested PSCs with La/TiO2 mesoporous layers demonstrated a higher PCE than that with the undoped TiO2 mesoporous layer. The average PCE on a basis of 14 devices is 14.23% for the La/TiO2-PSC and 11.05% for the undoped TiO2-PSC, respectively, unambiguously indicating that La doping appreciably improves the PSC performance. Moreover, the typical J–V curves of PSCs with undoped and La-doped mp-TiO2 measured in both reverse and forward scans (Fig. S4 and Table S1†) show that La-doping not only improves the device PCE to a great extent, and also alleviates the hysteresis effect. The stability test (Fig. S5†) under ambient conditions (40–50% RH) at room temperature (20–25 °C) indicates that both devices show similar stability. It should be noted here that since TiO2 P25 was directly used to prepare La/TiO2 and the mesoporous layer instead of the commercial TiO2 paste optimized for PSC application, it is believed that the overall PCE could be further enhanced by optimizing the La/TiO2 paste for the PSC.

To investigate the reasons behind the performance enhancement, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was applied to determine the Fermi energy of both TiO2 films. As shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), the Fermi energy was calculated to be −4.43 eV and −4.55 eV for the La/TiO2 and undoped TiO2 respectively, which was determined by using the cutoff energy and the equation of hν − ϕ = EFermi − Ecutoff, where hν is the energy of the HeI emission line (21.22 eV), EFermi is 21.08 eV (calibrated by using the Ni standard sample), and ϕ is the work function of the sample. In comparison with undoped TiO2, La/TiO2 represented a higher Fermi energy due to the fact that lanthanum has high binding affinity to oxygen, thus scavenging oxygen and inducing vacancies on the surface of TiO2 when La3+ is doped into TiO2. A similar phenomenon was found in the devices with Y3+ doped TiO2 compact layers developed by Yang et al.22 They demonstrated that yttrium-doped TiO2 have a slightly upward shifted Fermi energy compared with undoped TiO2, resulting in an increased donor concentration in response to the enhanced conductivity. It was reported that the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band maximum (CBM) for the CH3NH3PbI3 are 5.3 and 3.75 eV, respectively,31 and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of spiro-OMeTAD is located at 5.22 eV.32 The schematic diagram of the energy levels in both PSCs is illustrated in Fig. 4(c). After the La doping, the Fermi energy of La/TiO2 shifted upward due to the increase of the amount of oxygen vacancies on the TiO2 surface,33 resulting in the improved VOC and the enhanced carrier concentration. These defects could act as n-type dopants to increase the number of free electrons in the TiO2 and thus the conductivity. Accordingly, the series resistance (RS) of the PSC decreases compared with the PSC with undoped TiO2, causing the increase of the fill factor. Benefiting from these effects, the La/TiO2-PSCs exhibit significantly improved performance compared with the undoped TiO2-PSC. Based on the above results and analysis, our approach for La3+ doping of a TiO2 mesoporous layer is proved to be effective for improving the performance of PSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated an effective way to improve the PCE of PSCs by tuning the Fermi level of a mesoporous TiO2 layer through La doping. The analyses indicate that La-doping can shift the Fermi energy of TiO2 upward by 0.12 eV by means of scavenging oxygen species, thus inducing vacancies on the TiO2 surface. This upward shift of the Fermi energy subsequently enhances the VOC of the PSC and carrier concentration, which in turn reduce the series resistance of the PSC and increase the JSC and FF of the PSC. Consequently, La/TiO2-PSCs exhibit substantially enhanced performance compared with the undoped TiO2-PSC in terms of the 27.3% improvement in the PCE. It is believed that the present approach by doping a TiO2 based electron transport layer to tune the band alignment of PSCs would open up opportunities to further boost the PCEs of perovskite solar cells.
