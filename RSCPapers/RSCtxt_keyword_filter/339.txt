The elemental analysis revealed that the efficiency improvement of the photovoltaic module was the essential factor for the new high STH efficiency.
Introduction
Among renewable energy sources such as solar thermal, geothermal, wind, and biomass, photovoltaic technology has the highest capacity to realize a sustainable society owing to its low-cost requirement.1–3 To utilize photovoltaics as a stable source of power, the development of storage technologies is essential to compensate for its intermittency.4 Photovoltaic hydrogen generation is a promising solution to this challenge because hydrogen can be stored, transported, and consumed without producing environmental burdens such as CO2.5–7 The International Energy Agency (IEA) has presented a net-zero scenario of 520 million tons of hydrogen production in 2050, 62% of which would be produced by water electrolysis from renewable energy sources.8 Assuming an electricity of 55 kW h to produce 1 kg-H2 by water electrolysis, 18 PW h is required to produce the above-mentioned amount of hydrogen, and this corresponds to 10 TW of photovoltaic capacity when the capacity factor is 20%. In the case of preparing such a gigantic photovoltaic generator, the improvement of solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency directly reduces the cost of produced hydrogen,9 which is currently 2–5 times higher than hydrogen from methane reforming,10 in addition to reducing life cycle greenhouse gas emission.11
The simple electrical connection of photovoltaic (PV) with an electrolysis cell (EC) is the most representative system to convert solar energy into hydrogen, while various types of connection have been proposed to improve the STH conversion efficiency (ηSTH). The mechanical integration of PV and EC has been reported12–14 to suppress the PV efficiency drop due to the temperature increase while utilizing the heat to improve the EC performance. Also, the improvement of the operation point matching between PV and EC was attempted either by inserting DC/DC converters15,16 or by heating EC.17 However, on the condition that the 1 sun is used as the only power source, no ηSTH has been reported exceeding the value of 24.4%, which was recorded under the ideal operation point matching achieved by the optimized number set of PV and EC.18 While ηSTH > 30% was reported with the heated EC case,17 the actual efficiency should be much lower as the heating energy was not considered in ηSTH calculation. This indicates that, as long as the optimized matching is realized, the overall ηSTH cannot be further increased without improving the conversion efficiency of the PV or EC.
Multi-junction solar cells are known to exhibit conversion efficiency exceeding the Shockley–Queisser limit of 32–33% imposed on the single-junction solar cells, and the efficiency is expected to be even higher when the number of sub-cells is increased by suppressing the loss of photon energy.19,20 This expectation was experimentally demonstrated by a five-junction (5J) solar cell which was developed by a cost-effective upright metamorphic growth and showed 41% efficiency at 589 suns.21 Therefore, in this study, a concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) module with 5J solar cells was employed for the STH conversion. A maximum ηSTH of 28.2% under natural sunlight was obtained by achieving high conversion and matching efficiency at the same time, and this was a new high record of ηSTH observed with a CPV-EC system.
Methodology
CPV module with the AlInGaP/InGaP/AlInGaAs/InGaAs/Ge 5J solar cell was manufactured by AZUR SPACE Solar Power GmbH and Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. From top to bottom, the five subcells of the solar cell are made of AlInGaP (Eg = 1.95 eV), InGaP (Eg = 1.65 eV), AlInGaAs (Eg = 1.40 eV), InGaAs (Eg = 1.15 eV), and Ge (Eg = 0.67 eV) respectively. The size of the Fresnel lens was 65 mm × 65 mm and the concentration factor was 835. Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) type EC stack (diameter: 90 mm, active area: 14.7 cm2, Enoah Inc.) was used for the electrolysis of water. EC was constructed by the following procedure; PEM of Nafion was coated on both sides with Ir and Pt, respectively, and this catalyst-coated membrane was sandwiched between Ti (anode) and stainless steel (cathode) mesh. 1 and 2 cell stacks (EHC-070 and EHC-120) were connected in series to form 3 cell-stack in total. Ultrapure water (Millipore, 18.2 MΩ cm) was used as the feeding water for EC.
The CPV module and the EC were directly connected to construct the CPV-EC system. The image and circuit diagram of the operating system are shown in Fig. 1. The CPV module was set on a solar tracker and the focus of the sunlight was positioned on the cell by controlling the tilting angle of the module. All electrical connections were made with standard copper cables with a diameter of 2.4 mm, which introduced negligible resistance compared with other components of the system. The operating voltage of the EC (Vop) was measured by connecting a data logger (HIOKI, LR8515) between two terminals of the cell stacks, and the operating current (Iop) was measured by a cramp meter (HIOKI, CM4373-91). EC was kept fed with enough amount of water by positioning it under a water tank. Evolved hydrogen from the EC was first introduced to a gas–liquid separator and then to a dehumidifier (equipped with molecular sieves and silica gel) and mass flow meter (KOFLOC, EX-700R) for the measurement of the hydrogen evolution rate. The evolved O2 with an excess amount of water was returned to the water tank. EC and feeding water were exposed to the outside air and their temperature was not controlled. Direct nominal irradiance (DNI) was measured by a pyrheliometer (EKO, MS-56) which was also set on the tracker. Vop, Iop, hydrogen evolution rate, and DNI were collected and recorded continuously during the experiment. One measurement was conducted by running the system for 3 h. The I–V curve of the CPV was measured every 1 h with an analyzer (PROVA 1011a) after disconnecting the CPV and EC temporarily.

Results and discussion
The experiment was conducted on a clear, cloudless winter day and whole the system was left outside without any control of temperature. Typically, the outside temperature ranged from 5 to 10 °C. From the obtained data, ηSTH and the elementary efficiencies (ηPV, ηop, ηEC, ηF) were calculated based on the equation below:  where Psun is the incident sunlight power received by the CPV modules, Pmax is the maximal power output of the CPV module, Pop is the actual operating power of the EC, n is the number of EC (here n = 3), and IH2 is a partial current used for hydrogen generation. The elementary efficiencies can be interpreted as follows: ηPV is the CPV module efficiency; ηop is the matching efficiency between the maximal power point of the CPV modules and the actual operating point; ηEC is the energy loss owing to the over-potential of the EC; ηF is the faradaic efficiency. Psun, Pop, and IH2 were calculated from the collected data of DNI, the operating voltage and current (Vop and Iop), and the hydrogen flow rate, respectively. Pmax was obtained by measuring the I–V curve of the CPV module. As Pmax was recorded only once per hour while other parameters were recorded continuously, the average values of each parameter over 5 min after the measurement time of Pmax were used for the elementary efficiency calculation.
DNI, ηSTH, and the elementary efficiencies at three time points (11:00, 12:00, and 13:00) obtained on January 14th, 2022 are summarized in Table 1 as trial #1. The highest ηSTH was achieved at 12:00 and the value of 27.1% exceeded the last world record of 24.4% reported with 3J CPV module.18 The elemental efficiencies were then assessed to identify the factor that contributed to this high ηSTH. First, it should be noted that ηop exceeded 100% possibly because of the underestimation of Pmax. While this underestimation does not influence the value of ηSTH, this can decrease the calculated value of ηPV. In fact, ηPV of 32.2% was relatively low for a 5J solar cell, and the actual value was assumed to be ∼1.1 times higher (therefore ∼35%) judging from the value of ηop. ηEC was 77% which is slightly smaller than the typical value of ∼80% for a PEM type electrolyser,22–24 while this can be explained by the low ambient temperature. ηF showed the ideal value of 100% which indicates there was no loss of the electron. As ηPV alone showed significant improvement compared to the previous measurement,18 it can be concluded that the high ηSTH resulted from the improved conversion efficiency of the CPV module, owing to the use of a 5J solar cell. ηPV is expected to be improved even further by suppressing the restriction factors such as light refraction by the Fresnel lens or the accumulated heat due to the light concentration.

To confirm the continuous performance of the system, the time course of each efficiency was also analyzed (Fig. 2). Here, ηPV × ηop (or Pop/Psun) was obtained instead of ηPV and ηop due to the intermittent measurement of the Pmax. The moving average over 1 min (average of 12 data points) of each efficiency was used to suppress the measurement noise of the raw data. The maximum value for ηSTH (solid line in Fig. 2a), the measured DNI (black line in Fig. 2b), and averaged values of each efficiency over the entire time range (dashed lines) are also shown for comparison. ηSTH shows curved transition peaked at around noon, and instantaneously achieved its maximum value of 28.2% at around 11:45. While ηSTH decreased with Psun after 13:00, the averaged value of ηSTH (26.5%) still exceeded the last record of 24.4%. This shows that the combination of a 5J CPV and EC can achieve up to 4% greater STH efficiency than a system comprising 3J CPV and EC, thereby validating the manufacture of 5J CPV, which is currently under development, for the purpose of solar hydrogen production. Focusing on the elemental efficiencies, ηPV × ηop showed the same time course as ηSTH which indicates that ηSTH is most affected by the efficiency of the CPV module, and this is consistent with the former discussion. As for ηEC and ηF, only fluctuations around the average values were observed all the time, suggesting that the operation condition of CPV had little effect on the efficiency of the EC. The variation in ηF from 100% may have been attributed to the harsh external conditions (e.g. low temperature, high winds), however, the quantification of the hydrogen remained unaffected as the error of the 5 minutes average value was less than 3% (Table 1).

The same experiment was conducted two more times on the other days and the measured DNI and each efficiency are also summarized in Table 1 as trials #2 and #3. Both the average and the maximum values of ηSTH are the highest in trial #1, and this can be correlated to the particularly high DNI in trial #1. This trend between ηSTH and DNI becomes more obvious when the data sets of ηSTH and corresponding DNI obtained every 30 minutes were plotted (Fig. 3a). To find the reason for this relation, further analysis was conducted based on the I–V curves of CPV and EC. First, Fig. 3b shows the I–V curves of CPV obtained under DNI = 970, 900, and 860 W m−2. ηPV can be represented as follows:  where Voc is the open-circuit voltage, Isc is the short circuit current, and FF is the fill factor which is the ratio between Pmax and Voc × Isc. The parameters obtained from the I–V curves are summarized in Table 2. Both Vmax to Voc and Imax to Isc ratio increased with DNI, and these led to the improvement of FF and eventually ηPV. Therefore, an increase of ηPV under large DNI can be considered a major factor for the improvement of ηSTH. Next, ηop was examined by the overlapping of the I–V curves. Fig. 3c shows an enlarged figure of the cross points of the two curves, which indicate the operation points (Vop, Iop), while the red makers and line show the maximum power points (Vmax, Imax) and a fitted curve. It can be seen that the operation point gets closer to the maximum power point when DNI gets larger, and this indicates the improvement of ηop which can be expressed as follows:

In fact, ηop calculated from (Vop, Iop) and (Vmax, Imax) shows its best value of 99.0% when DNI is its highest. While ηEC was also calculated and listed in Table 2, it was found to have minimal effect on ηSTH as its change with DNI was only ±0.2%. In total, it can be concluded that both ηPV and ηop were improved under the large DNI, which in turn led to the record high ηSTH of 28.2%.
Conclusions
In this study, a record-high STH efficiency of 28.2% was achieved under natural sunlight by the combination of EC and a CPV module equipped with a 5J solar cell. Detailed analysis revealed that improvement of ηPV due to the adaption of 5J solar cell was the major factor for the high STH efficiency. DNI was also found to be an important factor which contributed to the improvement of both ηPV and ηop. By solving the problems of light reflection and heat accumulation in CPV modules, the performance of 5J solar cells will be maximized and even higher STH efficiency can be expected.
