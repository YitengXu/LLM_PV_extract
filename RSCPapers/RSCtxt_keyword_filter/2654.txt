    , Accepted 23rd November 2021First published on 23rd November 2021AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) capable of an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of over 1.5 V were fabricated based on a formamidinium lead-bromide (FAPbBr3) perovskite absorber film prepared by a sequential deposition procedure using a dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and tetramethylenesulfoxide (TMSO) mixed solvent. A PbBr2 film formed from a precursor PbBr2 solution with the DMSO–TMSO mixed solvent was reacted with FABr to conversion into an FAPbBr3 film. The mixed solvent-based PbBr2 film exhibited an amorphous-like phase containing a PbBr2–TMSO complex, which led to the formation of an FAPbBr3 film possessing high crystallinity and a uniform thick absorber layer compared with the pristine PbBr2 film prepared with pure DMSO solvent. With a bandgap of 2.1 eV, FAPbBr3-based PSCs prepared via the solution process with the PbBr2–TMSO complex exhibited a high VOC value of up to 1.55 V and a power conversion efficiency of 7.8% on device fabrication using an Li-treated mesoporous TiO2 as an electron transport layer with a 5 × 5 mm2 cell active area.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have already occupied an important position as the most promising next-generation solar cells towards commercialization.1–5 The optical and physical properties of the lead-halide perovskite (APbX3) can be controlled by changing cation and halogen compositions.6–11 In particular, the halogen composition drastically affects the bandgap and carrier mobility of the perovskites. From the viewpoint of high conversion efficiency under the shining of sunlight, narrow bandgap perovskites based on lead iodide and tin iodide are favourable according to the Shockley–Queisser limit for a single junction device.12,13 Besides using the device as a solar cell, high-voltage photovoltaic devices based on bromide-rich wide bandgap perovskite are useful not only for the top cell of a tandem device,14–19 but also for an indoor power device sensitive to light-emitting diode (LED) illumination, which is a target of IoT photovoltaic devices. In a contribution to a low-carbon society, high-voltage output becomes more useful for light-assisted water splitting20–24 and charging Li-ion batteries.25–27 APbBr3 and Br-rich type perovskites (A = methylammonium,28–31 formamidinium (FA),32–36 ethylammonium,37 and Cs38–54) are good semiconductors as visible light absorbers and their PSCs are expected to output a high voltage exceeding 1.5 V based on their wide bandgap of over 2 eV. Additionally, bromide-based perovskites show excellent stability against humidity and phase stability under ambient conditions compared with iodide-rich perovskites.55
Wide bandgap Br-rich perovskite-based PSCs are generally prepared by a sequential deposition procedure,56 because a one-step procedure produces thin, rough, and perforated perovskite films due to their poor solubility and very quick crystal growth, particularly for Cs and Br-based perovskites. The sequential deposition method basically proceeds with a solid state reaction of a PbX2 with ammonium halide (AX) powder,57 vapor,58–61 and in solution56,62,63 to form APbX3 perovskite. Typically, the PbX2 film is reacted in the AX solution and thermally annealed to convert into APbX3 perovskite. The quality and morphology of the obtained perovskite film reflect the morphology of the precursor PbX2 films and reaction conditions. For example, when the reaction time is too long or the concentration of the AX solution is too high, the morphology of the obtained APbX3 film is drastically changed through Ostwald ripening, and finally many pinholes and micron-order surface roughness are formed. Conversely, when the reaction time and the concentration of the AX solution are insufficient or the thickness of PbX2 is too thick, an unreacted PbX2 layer between the perovskite and carrier transport layers prevents light harvesting and carrier transport. Therefore, appropriate modification of the precursor PbX2 film by additives and morphology control improves the reactivity of the PbX2 film and the resulting conversion efficiency in PSCs. Han et al. showed that an amorphous PbI2 film was converted into an MAPbI3 film with high reproducibility by a sequential deposition method.64 Seok et al. reported that a layered PbI2–DMSO film showed high reactivity to produce a high quality FAPbI3 perovskite film.65 It has been explained that FAPbI3 is formed through exchange of DMSO with FA, minimizing crystal lattice expansion due to their comparable molecular sizes. Furthermore, porous PbX2 film prepared from a mixture of PbI2 and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) as an additive exhibited excellent reactivity to produce high-quality perovskite film.66–68 Because of the porous PbI2 film morphology, MAI can approach the deepest parts and the PbI2 is completely converted to perovskite even in a thick PbI2 film. Therefore, it is important to optimize both reaction conditions and PbX2 film morphology for high-efficiency solar cells by a sequential deposition method, particularly for poorly reactive and low-soluble Br-rich wide bandgap perovskites. To obtain a high-quality FAPbBr3 perovskite film for PSCs, we explored new precursor materials and crystallization methods, and found that the reactivity of a PbBr2 film was improved by the addition of a cyclic sulfoxide, tetramethylenesulfoxide (TMSO, Fig. 1), into a precursor PbBr2 solution. A high-quality FAPbBr3 film was obtained by morphological improvement with TMSO. A PSC based on this FAPbBr3 absorber achieved a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of over 1.5 V. In this manuscript, we report the effect of TMSO on PbBr2 film morphology, reactivity, and improvement in photovoltaic properties.

2. Results and discussion
First, we prepared FAPbBr3 perovskite films from PbBr2 films with and without TMSO, and characterized these films by XRD measurements. Prior to this research, we carried out a preliminary study of the influence of amount of TMSO on device performance to decide the experimental conditions (Fig. S1–S5 and Table S1†). With the addition of TMSO, the short-circuit current densities (JSC) of all the FAPbBr3 cells were improved. Among the entries, an FAPbBr3 cell with 0.8 (10 vol%) TMSO showed the highest VOC and efficiency (Table S1†). According to this result, the TMSO/Pb molar ratio was fixed at 0.8 unless otherwise stated in this manuscript. As shown in Fig. 2a and S2,† for PbBr2 films without TMSO, an intense diffraction peak of PbBr2 (002) was observed at 2θ = 18.6°. In contrast, with the addition of TMSO, the corresponding diffraction peaks almost disappeared and unknown small peaks were detected, implying that the PbBr2 films with TMSO were substantially amorphous. To reveal the impact of the TMSO on the PbBr2 film structure, PbBr2 (with) films were annealed at different temperatures from 80 to 140 °C (Fig. 2b). When the PbBr2 film was annealed at 100 °C, a small diffraction peak of PbBr2 (002) appeared at 2θ = 18.6°, and small diffraction peaks around 2θ = 10° and 20° disappeared. With increasing annealing temperature, the intensity of this diffraction peak increased due to the evaporation of TMSO from the PbBr2 film, indicating that TMSO prevents the crystallization of PbBr2. Then, the PbBr2 films with and without TMSO were treated with FABr and annealed at 80 °C to prepare FAPbBr3 perovskite. As mentioned in the Introduction, repeated treatment of PbBr2 film with FABr and thermal annealing processes gradually spoils the quality of the perovskite film via Ostwald ripening. Therefore, to finish with one FABr treatment, we optimized the reaction conditions by means of high concentration of hot FABr solution combined with a dynamic-casting procedure. As a result, an appropriate amount of FABr could be kept on the PbBr2 film homogeneously to complete the conversion into the perovskite phase. The XRD patterns of FAPbBr3 (with and w/o) are shown in Fig. 2c and d. All of the FAPbBr3 films presented (001) and (011) diffraction peaks at 2θ = 14.8 and 20.8°, respectively.69,70 The intensity of the (001) diffraction peak of FAPbBr3 (with) is more than double that of the FAPbBr3 (w/o) film. For the FAPbBr3 (with) film, comparing the relative peak intensities between (001) and (011) diffraction peaks, the (001) peak is approximately seven times greater than the (011) peak. In contrast, for the FAPbBr3 (w/o) film, the intensities of the (001) peak are approximately the same as triple the (011) peak, indicating that the crystal grains in the FAPbBr3 (with) film are highly oriented in comparison with the FAPbBr3 (w/o) film. Then, we checked the influences of the PbBr2 concentration on the morphology of the perovskite film. For FAPbBr3 (w/o) films, with increasing PbBr2 concentration, the intensity of the FAPbBr3 (001) peak increased. When the concentration of PbBr2 solution was over 1.2 M, a diffraction peak of unreacted PbBr2 (002) was observed at 18.6° because the film was too thick to completely convert to FAPbBr3. With increasing PbBr2 concentration, the (002) diffraction peak became larger, meaning that a lot of unreacted PbBr2 remained at the bottom of the perovskite layer. In contrast, using PbBr2 (with) films, a pure perovskite phase was obtained when the concentration of PbBr2 was up to 1.3 M. Therefore, the TMSO additive enables an improvement in the reactivity of PbBr2 into lead-bromide perovskites, and a resulting higher conversion efficiency is expected based on the improved perovskite film quality. When the PbBr2 concentration was increased to over 1.4 M, new diffraction peaks appeared at 2θ = 9.8 and 19.3°. We expected these unknown diffraction peaks to be attributed to a by-product based on PbBr2 and TMSO. To characterize this unknown by-product, we prepared a PbBr2·TMSO single crystal from 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solution, and XRD diffraction measurements were carried out (Fig. S3†). Compared with the reported XRD data of solvated PbBr2 and PbI2 compounds,71–74 we concluded that the unknown product can be assigned to the PbBr2·TMSO complex. It is expected that during the reaction of PbBr2 with FABr, TMSO was gradually consumed from the PbBr2–TMSO mixture and reacted with excess PbBr2 at the grain boundaries and perovskite/TiO2 interface, forming PbBr2·TMSO crystals. Although DMSO is a major component in the mixed solvent (DMSO:TMSO = 9:1), residual DMSO and related components were not detected by XRD or IR (vide infra) measurements for the PbBr2 and FAPbBr3 films independent of the PbBr2 concentration.

To obtain further information about the amorphous-like PbBr2–TMSO film, we recorded the attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-FTIR spectra of the PbBr2 films. Fig. 3a presents IR spectra of PbBr2 films prepared from DMSO or DMF solutions containing different concentrations of TMSO (0–20 vol%). These films were prepared by spin-coating and annealed at 80 °C. As a comparison, the IR spectra of neat DMSO and TMSO are also presented. For the control PbBr2 film prepared from a DMSO solution, the characteristic signal of the DMSO molecule (SO stretching mode) was not observed in the present region (ν = 800–1200 cm−1). With the addition of TMSO, a new signal appeared at 928 cm−1, which is attributed to the SO stretching mode of TMSO. To confirm that the peak is not attributable to the coexisting DMSO solvent, we similarly prepared PbBr2 films from DMF solutions. For the PbBr2 film without TMSO, no signal was observed in the same energy region as that for the film prepared from DMSO solution. With the addition of TMSO, similar peaks appeared at the same position (ν = 928 cm−1) as for the PbBr2–TMSO films prepared from DMSO solutions. It is reported that the SO stretching mode of a PbBr2–mono-DMSO complex (PbBr2·DMSO) can be observed at ca. 980 cm−1.72 Additionally, as mentioned above, no diffraction peaks assigned to PbBr2 mono- or bis-DMSO complexes were observed (Fig. 2). Therefore, the peak at 928 cm−1 is assigned to the SO stretching mode of TMSO coordinated with the Pb atom. Ding et al. observed stronger TMSO–Pb interaction than that of DMSO by comparison of the peak shift in the IR spectra between PbX2–DMSO and TMSO complexes.75 The boiling point of TMSO (269 °C) is higher than that of DMSO (189 °C). On the basis of these features, TMSO remained in the PbBr2 film even after thermal annealing at 80 °C and prevented the crystallization of the PbBr2 film unlike DMSO. As a result, an amorphous-like PbBr2–TMSO film was obtained.

Fig. 3b and c show UV spectra of PbBr2 and FAPbBr3 films with or without TMSO prepared from different concentrations of PbBr2 precursor solutions in DMSO solvents. The absorption onset of PbBr2 films is approximately 350 nm and their absorbances show no large differences. On the other hand, the absorption onset of PbBr2–TMSO film is red-shifted by 20 nm and reached ca. 370 nm. Additionally, the background level is increased because of their higher surface roughness. The absorption onset of FAPbBr3 perovskite films are at 550 nm independent of the addition of TMSO. With the addition of TMSO, the absorbance of the perovskite film is significantly increased. This matches well with the increased film thickness observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4 shows SEM images of PbBr2 films (1.2 M) and FAPbBr3 cells (with and w/o TMSO). The thicknesses of the PbBr2 (w/o) and (with) films are 103 and 167 nm, respectively (Fig. 4a). The PbBr2 (with) film is thicker than the PbBr2 (w/o) film due to the higher viscosity of TMSO compared with DMSO (TMSO: 5.25 and DMSO: 1.99 mPa s at 25 °C), and the higher volume caused by including TMSO molecules in the PbBr2 film. The surface texture of the PbBr2 film is drastically changed by the addition of TMSO. On the PbBr2 (w/o) film surface, micron-order island-like textures are observed. In contrast, many wrinkles appeared on the PbBr2 (with) film surface and the surface roughness was increased, leading to a hazy appearance and increased background in the absorption spectra (Fig. 3b). After FABr treatment, the morphology of the resulting FAPbBr3 film was also different. For the control FAPbBr3 film, its grain shape is not uniform (Fig. S5†). With the addition of TMSO, the grain size becomes slightly smaller and the grain shape changes to round on the TMSO 0.4 film. With the further addition of TMSO, the grain size becomes uniform and it appears to have a dome-like shape. Fig. 4 shows cross-sectional SEM images of full photovoltaic devices prepared from different concentrations of PbBr2 precursor solutions. The device architecture of the FAPbBr3 cell is FTO/TiO2 CL (40 nm)/Li-treated TiO2 mesoporous layer (170 nm)/perovskite/PMMA (<5 nm)/spiro-OMeTAD (150 nm)/Au electrode (50 nm). As shown in Fig. 4b, the thicknesses of the perovskite layer in the PSCs (w/o) are 200–300 nm, which increased with an increase in the concentration of the precursor PbBr2 solution. With the addition of TMSO, the thickness of the PbBr2 film due to the volume of TMSO and resulting perovskite layers was significantly increased. Comparing FAPbBr3 film with and without TMSO, the thickness of the perovskite layer (with) was thicker than the film (without) prepared from the same concentration of PbBr2 solution. The FAPbBr3 (with) film comprises large single crystal grains, directly connecting the top HTL and bottom ETL. In contrast, FAPbBr3 (w/o) film contains small and large crystal grains and their surface is slightly rough. This coincides with the XRD result, in which the diffraction peaks are smaller and broader compared with those of FAPbBr3 (with) films. For the FAPbBr3 (w/o) film, diffraction peaks of unreacted PbBr2 started to appear when their concentration was over 1.2 M (Fig. 2c). In contrast, FAPbBr3 (with) films do not present any unreacted phase when the PbBr2 concentration is less than 1.3 M. Considering that the PbBr2–TMSO film is thicker than the pristine PbBr2 film prepared at the same concentration (Fig. 4a), the TMSO improved the reactivity of the PbBr2 films with FABr. Additionally, for both devices (with and w/o), the pores inside the TiO2 mesoporous layers are not filled with perovskite crystals based on high-concentration solutions (1.4 and 1.5 M). Therefore, it is expected that the precursor solution could not soak into the TiO2 mesoporous film due to the high viscosity of the high-concentration solutions.
We suggest the formation mechanism of the amorphous-like PbBr2–TMSO film based on ATR-IR and XRD data, and illustrate the expected schemes in Fig. 5. For pristine PbBr2 in a DMSO solvent, isolated PbBr2 units are solvated/coordinated by DMSO. After spin-coating, excess DMSO has been removed, and coordinated and limited DMSO remains in the wet PbBr2 film. Then, upon thermal annealing at 80 °C, all of the DMSO molecules are evaporated and a crystalline PbBr2 film is obtained. For the case of PbI2, a higher annealing temperature is required to perfectly evaporate DMSO solvent from PbI2·DMSOX complexes. It is reported that a PbI2 film prepared from DMSO solution shows a stepwise colour change from colourless PbI2·(DMSO)2, to pale yellow PbI2·DMSO, to vivid yellow PbI2 during thermal annealing.76,77 In contrast, PbBr2 directly gives a colourless PbBr2 crystalline film due to the small and more electronegative bromide ion and weaker Pb–O coordination. In the presence of TMSO, TMSO preferentially coordinates to PbBr2 due to its stronger coordinating ability with Pb.74,75 After spin-coating, DMSO still remains in the wet PbBr2 film. By thermal annealing at 80 °C, only the DMSO molecules are evaporated from the wet PbBr2 film; however, TMSO molecules strongly bonded to the Pb atom remain in the dried PbBr2 film. The IR and XRD results indicated that TMSO molecules in the dried film are bonded to the Pb atom and the PbBr2–TMSO film presents no specific or intense diffraction peaks corresponding to the expected compounds. Interestingly, this amorphous-like phase is formed almost independently of the TMSO amount; TMSO/PbBr2 ratio = 0.4–1.2, as shown in Fig. S6,† meaning that TMSO does not form a homogeneous PbBr2–TMSO complex. By thermal annealing of the PbBr2–TMSO film at higher temperature above 100 °C, the diffraction peak of crystalline PbBr2 (002) appeared, and with an increase in annealing temperature, the intensity of the diffraction peak increased (Fig. 2b). Therefore, the remnant TMSO molecules cut into isolated oligomeric [PbBr2]n units and inhibit the crystallization of PbBr2.

Fig. 6a and b show the photoluminescent (PL) spectra and decay curves of FAPbBr3 (with or w/o) films prepared from a 1.3 M PbBr2 solution on a mesoporous Al2O3 film. The PL spectra present an intense peak at 543 nm for both films (Fig. 6a). The FAPbBr3 with TMSO has a more intense peak than FAPbBr3 (w/o). Table 1 presents the time constants obtained by double-exponential fitting of the PL decay curves using eqn (1) in Table 1, where τ1 and τ2 denote the time constant and A1 and A2 are the amplitudes of the fitting function. The PL lifetime of the film with TMSO is longer than that of the (w/o) film. The τ1 and τ2 of FAPbBr3 film (with) are longer than those of FAPbBr3 (w/o) film (Table 1). In a lead-halide perovskite film, τ1, shorter recombination, is due to the non-radiative recombination of separated charges, and τ2, longer recombination, is ascribed to the carrier recombination at surface defects.78–80 As shown in Fig. 4b, the FAPbBr3 perovskite film (with) consists of larger crystal grains compared to the perovskite film (w/o). As smaller crystal grains have more surface defects than larger crystal grains, the longer PL lifetime reflects the better crystal quality of the large grains in FAPbBr3 (with) film. Additionally, it is expected that suppression of metallic Pb formation (see next paragraph) and a surface passivation effect by remnant TMSO molecules at the grain boundary and film surface74 affected the longer PL lifetime of FAPbBr3 (with) film.

Fig. 6c shows the XPS spectra of FAPbBr3 perovskite with and w/o TMSO. For the w/o film, metallic Pb peaks (*) are observed besides the Pb(II) peaks. In contrast, the corresponding Pb(0) peaks in the FAPbBr3 with TMSO film does not appear. The presence of metallic Pb indicates that bromide defects exist in the FAPbBr3 (w/o) film which behaves as a recombination centre and ion migration passageway. As a result, deterioration in photovoltaic performance is expected.
Then, we prepared photovoltaic cells based on the FAPbBr3 perovskite films with and without the TMSO additive. Fig. 6d–g show their photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra. Their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Fig. 7 and Table S2.† Reflecting the thick perovskite layer, all the PSCs (with) exhibited higher JSC compared to the PSCs (w/o) prepared from the same concentration of PbBr2 solution. For a 1.0 M PSCs (w/o), the J–V curve showed an S-shape due to excess FABr remaining at the interface between FAPbBr3 and HTL because the amount of FABr was adjusted for thicker PbBr2 films. Its JSC value was less than 4 mA cm−2 reflecting a thin perovskite layer. In contrast, the average VOC of the PSC was approximately 1.4 V, and the best value reached 1.47 V. Because of poor JSC and FF, the conversion efficiency (PCE) was approximately 2%. To improve the photocurrent values, the concentration of the PbBr2 precursor solution was increased to 1.4 M. When the PbBr2 concentration was increased to 1.2 M, the JSC value was improved to approximately 5.5 mA cm−2. A further increase in the concentration did not change the JSC values. The best VOC value of the PSCs (w/o) was up to 1.40 V for 1.2 and 1.3 M devices. With an increase in the PbBr2 concentration (and resulting film thickness), the VOC value gradually decreased. It is expected that when the film thickness is increased, defects at grain boundaries, inside, and on the surface of the grains are increased due to the unreacted PbBr2 and small crystal grains, resulting in a decrease in the VOC value compared with 1.0 M PSC based on the thinner perovskite film. In contrast, PSCs (with) exhibited higher JSC values compared to PSCs (w/o), and the best JSC achieved was over 7.0 mA cm−2. With an increase in the concentration of the precursor PbBr2 solution (perovskite film thickness), the JSC values increased, unlike those without TMSO. The VOC value also improved and the best VOC value reached 1.5 V for 1.2 and 1.3 M cells retaining high JSC values, unlike the case of the (1.0 M) PSC (w/o). It is expected that TMSO contributes not only to high-quality crystal growth, but also to defect passivation. Some TMSO still remains in the FAPbBr3 films at the grain boundaries and interfaces due to the strong coordinating power and high boiling point of TMSO, and a passivation effect of TMSO is reported;74 therefore, TMSO passivation also contributes to the high VOC in our FAPbBr3 cells. However, a further increase in concentration largely resulted in a deterioration in VOC and FF while JSC was not affected. Additionally, J–V hysteresis was increased for the PSCs based on 1.4 and 1.5 M solutions due to the FF and VOC (Fig. 7a). The cross-sectional SEM images (Fig. 4 and S7†) show a possible cause for the enhancement in hysteresis. For the PSCs w/o TMSO, the mesoporous TiO2 layer is filled with perovskite crystals. In contrast, the mesoscopic layer in the PSCs with TMSO is not filled perfectly. In particular, in the 1.4 and 1.5 M cells, many free pores can clearly be observed in the mesoporous TiO2 layer. The incomplete pore filling of perovskite in the TiO2 mesoscopic layer is due to the high viscosity of the high-concentration PbBr2 solution. As a result, the interface area between perovskite and TiO2 decreases, and an unmatched rate between hole extraction and electron extraction, with the latter being reduced, becomes responsible for the enhanced hysteresis. Phenomena resembling this were observed on a mixed TiO2/Al2O3 mesoporous scaffold81 and solvent vapor annealed PSCs.82 After an aging process under dry and dark conditions, the J–V performance of the champion device, particularly FF and VOC, was gradually improved (Fig. S8†), and finally its VOC and PCE reached 1.55 V and 7.8%, respectively, after 3 weeks had passed. Fig. 7b depicts the J–V performance of the best device obtained by the post-aging treatment. We have summarized reported efficiencies for PSCs based on Br-rich wide-bandgap perovskites in which VOC exceeds 1.4 V (Table S3†) to check the position of our results for further improvement. Among the FAPbBr3 cells, our VOC and FF (1.55 and 0.74) are at the highest level; however, the JSC of 6.96 mA cm−2 is lower, reflecting the lower IPCE maximum of less than 80%. Focusing on the “not high” JSC devices, their device architectures are TiO2 mesoporous cells; therefore, it is expected that the carrier collection efficiency of the TiO2 mesoporous layer is low. Additionally, all reported cell sizes are less than 0.09 mm2; however, our device possesses a large active area of 0.25 mm2, leading to low JSC and FF by the higher series resistance and recombination rate.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we successfully developed high-voltage FAPbBr3-based PSCs via a sequential deposition method with a TMSO in a precursor PbBr2 solution, leading to a highly crystalline and thick perovskite film. A precursor PbBr2–TMSO film showed a thick and amorphous-like film morphology with higher reactivity for conversion into FAPbBr3 perovskite compared with pristine PbBr2 film. PSCs based on such an FAPbBr3 film with TMSO allow us to achieve high JSC and VOC values due to its thick, highly crystalline, and pinhole-free film morphology. By optimization of TMSO and PbBr2 concentrations, the best PCE was obtained on a PSC prepared from 1.3 M PbBr2–TMSO precursor solution. The FAPbBr3 based on 1.3 M PbBr2–TMSO was a pure perovskite phase confirmed by XRD measurement while a PSC prepared from pristine PbBr2 film retains unreacted PbBr2. The best VOC value was increased to 1.5 V, and after aging, it was finally improved to 1.55 V. We believe this method is widely applicable to the preparation of other Br-rich perovskites, particularly low-soluble Cs-based perovskites for high-voltage PSCs.
4. Experimental
4.1. General information
All reagents and solvents were purchased from chemical companies (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation, and Sigma-Aldrich Japan). A TiO2 nano-particle paste (PST-18NR) was purchased from JGC Catalysts and Chemicals Ltd. The FTO glass substrate was bought from Peccell Technologies.
4.2. Preparation of the PSCs
An FTO glass substrate (2.5 × 2.5 cm2) was washed with EtOH, Hellmanex™ (2%), and deionized water by ultrasonic treatment for 20 min each. The cleaned FTO substrate was treated with UV-ozone cleaner. Then, 0.15 M [Ti(acac)2(iPrO)2] (acac = acetylacetonate and iPrO = iso-propoxy) in IPA was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and dried at 100 °C for 5 min. The substrate was cooled down, and a similar operation was carried out twice using 0.3 M [Ti(acac)2(iPrO)2] solution. The as-prepared films were then sintered in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 15 min to prepare a TiO2 compact layer (CL). An ethanolic TiO2 colloidal suspension (1:3, v/v) was cast onto the TiO2 CL by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 40 s. The substrate was dried at 120 °C for 10 min and then annealed at 450 °C for 40 min. The TiO2 mesoporous layer was treated with a stock solution of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li(TFSI)) (0.1 M in MeCN) and annealed at 450 °C for 20 min. Then, the Li-treated TiO2 substrate was transferred from a muffle furnace to a dry booth (dew point <−30 °C) during heating (over 120 °C) to avoid adsorption of humidity.
Before preparation of PbBr2 film, a precursor PbBr2 solution was warmed up and the hot mesoporous substrates were cooled down to 70 °C. A DMSO solution of PbBr2 (with or without TMSO) was spin-coated and dried at 80 °C, and then, an isopropanol (IPA) solution of FABr (200 mM) was dropped onto the PbBr2 film. To evaporate the solvent quickly, both the PbBr2 film and the FABr solution were warmed at 60 °C. The substrate was kept for 60 s, and slowly spin-coated (1000 rpm/5 s → 2000 rpm/3 s) to dry and to keep enough FABr on the PbBr2 film. Then, the FABr-treated PbBr2 film was annealed at 80 °C for 30 min to convert into FAPbBr3 perovskite. On the perovskite film, a PMMA solution in chlorobenzene (10 mg mL−1) was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s and dried at 80 °C for 10 min, and then an HTM solution; spiro-OMeTAD (28.9 mg), 520 mg mL−1 LiTFSI in MeCN (7 μL), tBP (11.52 μL), 0.2 M FK209 in MeCN (11.6 μL) in CB (400 μL), was dropped onto the spinning substrate (500 rpm) and the substrate was accelerated to 6000 rpm. The prepared cell was kept under dry and dark conditions overnight to promote oxidation of the hole transport layer. Finally, the gold electrode was vacuum-evaporated onto the HTL.
4.3. Preparation of PbBr2·TMSO single crystals
PbBr2 (1.835 g, 5 mmol) and TMSO (450 μL, 5 mmol) were dissolved in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (5 mL). The solution was stirred at r.t. for 1 h and filtrated. Diethyl ether (1.5 mL) was calmly poured onto the surface of the solution, and it was cooled down to −20 °C and kept for 2 weeks in a freezer. Colorless crystals were collected, washed with a 1:1 mixture of cold diethylether/1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, and vacuum dried at 50 °C for 1 h.
4.4. SEM and XRD measurements
SEM measurements were performed using an SU8000 (Hitachi High-Technologies Co.) microscope. XRD diffraction patterns were measured using a D8 Discover (Bruker-AXS K. K.) diffractometry using Cu-Kα radiation under operating conditions of 40 kV, 40 mA.
4.5. XPS measurements
XPS data were acquired using a spectrophotometer (PHI 5000 VersaProbe, ULVAC, Inc.) equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV), and the energy offset was calibrated using the C 1s peak of contaminant carbon as a reference at 284.8 eV.
4.6. Photovoltaic measurements
The cell active area (5 × 5 mm2) was defined by a black metal mask. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a PEC-L01 solar simulator (Peccell Technologies) under AM1.5G conditions (100 mW cm−2). Measurement conditions: step voltage: 0.01 V, search delay: 0.05 s, and hold time: 0.1 s. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were observed with a PEC-S20 spectrometer (Peccell Technologies).
4.7. Transient photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements
Photoluminescence (PL) spectra and PL decay curves were measured using a C11367 Quantaurus-Tau compact fluorescence lifetime spectrometer (Hamamatsu Photonics). The excitation light wavelength and power were 400 nm and 100 μW, respectively. The FAPbBr3 perovskite film (1.3 M) was prepared on an Al2O3 mesoporous substrate and covered with a PMMA layer to protect it from humidity.
4.8. ATR-IR spectroscopy measurements
IR spectra were observed using an IRPrestige-21 Fourier-transform infrared spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) with a Ge window. The samples (liquid or powder) were put directly on the Ge window. The PbBr2 films (1.2 M) were prepared by the same procedure as the solar cells using TMSO solvents with different concentrations.
