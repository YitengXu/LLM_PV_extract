    , Accepted 18th May 2015First published on 18th May 2015AbstractIn the present work, we introduce the anodic growth of conical shaped TiO2 nanotube arrays. These titania nanocones provide a scaffold for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) structures with significantly improved photon management, providing an optimized absorption profile compared with conventional cylindrical nanotube arrays. Finite difference time domain (FDTD) modelling demonstrates a drastically changed power-absorption characteristic over the tube length. When used in a back-side illumination DSSC configuration, nanocone structures can reach over 60% higher solar cell conversion efficiency (η) than conventional tubes. The resulting η ≈ 8% represents one of the highest reported values for Grätzel type DSSCs used under back-side illumination.
Over the past decades vertically aligned TiO2 nanotube layers that can be produced by a simple but optimized self-organizing electrochemical treatment of titanium in a suitable electrolyte have attracted wide scientific and technological interest.1,2 Due to the perpendicular alignment of these cylindrical nanotube arrays to the metal–substrate surface (back contact), a main thrust of research in this field is triggered by the anticipated beneficial use of these layers as electrodes in classic TiO2 photoelectrochemical applications, such as in photocatalysis or dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).3–5 In classic Grätzel type DSSCs a photoanode is used that consists of an approximately 10 μm thick layer of TiO2 nanoparticles that are coated with a monolayer of anchored dye molecules.6–9 The dye acts as visible light absorber, with energy of the LUMO that allows excited electrons to be injected into the conduction band of TiO2.8,10 The TiO2 scaffold in this case plays only the role of a conductor for electrons to the back contact. To obtain an efficient photovoltaic conversion in DSSCs, a maximized light absorption by the dye, an optimized transport through the TiO2 network and minimized recombination (mainly between oxidized dye and electrolyte) need to be established. In general, 1D structures, such as TiO2 nanotubes, are considered beneficial for electron transport due to the directionality provided by their geometry.11–13 Most straightforward is to grow TiO2 nanotube directly on the Ti metal thus providing directly back-contacted electrodes. This approach allows for effectively constructing back-side illumination configurations of DSSCs. These always have a lower efficiency than front-side illumination configuration DSSCs because in this case the light passes through a Pt-coated FTO counter electrode and a longer path in the iodine electrolyte.14 A potential shortcoming of nanotubes is their comparably low surface area. Therefore, to combine an optimum light absorption (high specific dye loading) with short connection pathways, typically hierarchical structures consisting of a TiO2 1D structure with a suitable nanoparticle decoration are used.15–19 In classical nanoparticle-based Grätzel solar cells minimizing reflection losses, while maximizing the light absorption by designing the microstructured optical properties of the cell constituents has been achieved very successfully in experiment and theory.20–29 Nevertheless, the efficiency of such solar cells is also determined by the shape of the depth dependent profile of photon absorption and carrier generation. A respective optimization of the light management within the absorber layer has up to now been almost completely neglected for TiO2 nanotube based solar cells. Typically these layers are produced by anodization of a Ti metal sheet. Under self-organizing conditions cylindrical nanotubes arrays of TiO2 with various geometries can be grown depending on the detailed anodization parameters. In fact, over recent years a wide range of TiO2 nanotube parameters such as length,4,5,30 diameter,30–33 and different annealing treatments30,34,35 have been investigated quite extensively towards an optimized DSSC efficiency. The tubes used in these studies typically have a diameter that is in the range of 100–180 nm and a length of 5–50 μm. Some works target small diameter nanotubes (to maximize the surface area for dye coating), or use hierarchical structures where nanotubes commonly are decorated with TiO2 nanoparticles. Nevertheless, virtually all studies were carried out with arrays of cylindrical tubes, as such layers are relatively easy and fast to fabricate.
Different to that, in the present article we introduce the growth of cone shaped tubes and show that with such a geometry a considerably optimized light and carrier management within a DSSC structure can be achieved in experiment and modeling. This leads to a considerable enhancement of the solar to light conversion efficiencies when these tubes are used in Grätzel type solar cells.
The morphological difference between classical cylindrical tubes and cone tubes is shown in Fig. 1 with high-resolution SEMs that show the tips (Fig. 1b and d) and ion-beam polished cross-section SEMs that show also the internal structure of the bases (Fig. 1c and f). Common cylindrically shaped TiO2 nanotubes with a length of L ≈ 13 μm (Fig. 1d–f), were grown in 0.1 M ammonium fluoride, 5 wt% H2O, 1.5 M lactic acid and ethylene glycol based electrolyte.33 These cylinders have a very slight taper from a diameter of Øb = 190 ± 20 nm at their base to a diameter of Øt = 160 ± 20 nm at the top (Fig. 1d, inset). In order to grow conically shaped tubes, as shown in Fig. 1a–c, we used an electrolyte based on triethyleneglycol (50 vol%), lactic acid (50 vol%) and 0.1 M ammonium fluoride as described in the experimental section (see in ESI†). This electrolyte composition is the key to grow nanocone layers (Con) with a large tube diameter as shown in the SEM images of Fig. 1a–c. Here the individual tube diameter at the tube base is Øb ≈ 450 ± 20 nm tapering to a top diameter of Øt ≈ 250 ± 20 nm (Fig. 1a, inset). These conical tubes were also grown to an overall tube length of L ≈ 13 μm. Exemplary diameters and lengths are highlighted in the high-resolution SEM zoom insets (Fig. 1b, c, e and f), while larger statistics were used to calculate the average values.
 Fig. 1  Morphological comparison of the cone (a–c) and cylinder (d–f) TiO2 nanotubes with SEM. The diameter of the cones increases from Øt ≈ 250 ± 20 nm at the top (b) to Øb ≈ 450 ± 20 nm at the bottom (c) over 13 μm length, while the diameter of the cylinders stays nearly constant between Øt ≈ 160 ± 20 nm and Øb ≈ 190 ± 20 nm for the same length (e and f). (g) Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics for DSSCs using both types of nanotubes. 
The main reason for a conical growth in this electrolyte is that the tube diameter depends on the effective anodization voltage, i.e. the applied voltage minus the resistive voltage drop in the electrolyte. In the case of the cone tubes we start with a low conductivity electrolyte that in course of the anodization process slowly self-increases its conductivity by the reaction by-products, and thus allows the average tube diameter continuously to grow, as the effective voltage continuously increases (see ESI† for more details).
Both types of tube layers were then exposed to a TiCl4 treatment8 (see ESI†) to create an optimized TiO2 nanoparticle decoration, then were dye sensitized, and finally assembled to a complete DSSC (for details see ESI†). Fig. 1g shows the current-to-voltage (I–V) curves for such solar cells measured under standard solar illumination AM 1.5 global (100 mW cm−2) conditions. The results show a remarkable difference for both tube types, yielding an efficiency of 8% for the cone tubes as opposed to only 5% for the cylinder tubes.
In order to clarify the reasons for this considerable efficiency enhancement in cone tubes we performed additional experiments (Fig. 2) and simulations (Fig. 3), particularly to pinpoint if the enhanced efficiency is connected to differences in dye loading, charge transport, or light scattering properties. Fig. 2a–d show the top morphology of the tubes after the TiCl4 treatment. For both tubes repeated TiCl4 particle decoration was carried out until the maximum solar cell efficiency was reached. A detailed description of the process is given in Fig. S2 of the ESI.†Fig. 2e shows the solar cell performance for cylinder and cone tubes with and without TiCl4 decoration. Table 1 provides the corresponding performance data (Jsc, Voc, FF) as well as the specific dye loading determined for the different solar cells. Clearly, TiCl4 decoration at both structures improves the performance drastically – namely the Jsc is increased corresponding to a higher amount of dye loading. Nevertheless, the overall amount of dye absorbed in both nanotube geometries is virtually the same: 148 nM cm−2 (Cy) and 144 nM cm−2 (Con). Most importantly, please note that although the decorated tubes yield a drastic difference in efficiency η(Cy) = 5% vs. η(Con) = 8%, the overall optimized particle loading yields for both solar cells virtually an identical dye loading (Table 1). This means that the observed differences in efficiency cannot be attributed to the potentially most straightforward reason – that is an overall different dye loading. If we additionally compare the overall reflectivity of the TiCl4 treated samples we see hardly any difference (Fig. 2f). A remarkable difference between Con(T) and Cy(T) is, however, that the IPCE data in Fig. 2f show for the nanocones samples a clearly better performance, namely that for the long wavelength region a considerably higher IPCE is obtained. Also measurements of the electron transfer time, obtained from IMPS measurements (Fig. 2h) show a significantly faster electron transport for the decorated cone tubes, while the decorated cylindrical tubes show a 3.5 times larger transport time. This improvement cannot be due to an intrinsically better electron conductivity of the cone tubes – as the non-decorated cone tubes show an even slightly inferior IPCE efficiency compared to the non-decorated cylindrical tubes.

 Fig. 3  (a) Electromagnetic simulation of the TiO2 cylinder system on Ti substrate, covered with a metamaterial of 50% density TiO2 crystals with dye. Power flow Pz and electric field Ex are indicated, as calculated with FDTD. (b) TiO2 cone system, displayed like (a). (c) Differential power absorption of solar light that is launched at z = 14 μm and travels towards the Ti substrate. After a strong interface absorption, the absorption in the cylinder system (blue curve) remains nearly constant, while the absorption in the cone system successively increases (orange curve), before both peak at the intersection of the active layer with the bottom Ti substrate. (d) The spectral absorption profiles for the cylinders (blue) and cones (orange) resembles the experimental IPCE curves (compare Fig. 2g). Within the lower 6 μm (small dashed) cone absorption outperforms cylinder absorption and the absorption spectrum broadens, in accordance with the experiment (compare Fig. 2g). Residual substrate absorption is shown as large dashed. 
To elucidate the origin of the clearly better performance of the cone tubes we simulated light absorption for the two geometries in the solar cells on a microscopic level, with finite difference time domain (FDTD) calculations in the extended visible wavelength range (λ0 = 400 nm to 1 μm) (see Fig. 3). All calculations were performed for an incident plane wave with the AM 1.5 global standard solar spectrum.36 Geometry parameters for these simulations (see Fig. 3a and b left) were carefully determined from experimental measurements (SEM, see Fig. 1 and 2) of the TiO2 cylinder and cone cells, respectively, and material parameters were chosen accordingly.
Both systems were modeled as a substrate of Ti, covered with a L = 13 μm thick layer that consists of a rectangular close lattice of TiO2 cylinders (Fig. 3a), respectively cones (Fig. 3b). Both types of nanotubes were covered with the experimentally optimized layer of TiO2 crystals that was 25 nm thick for the cylinders and 65 nm for the cone structures – this maintains a narrow open channel in the structures, in line with experimental observation. A monolayer of dye was adsorbed into this porous matrix and the resulting sub-wavelength structured optical metamaterial was modeled according to Maxwell–Garnett-Theory (MGT)37,38 with a 50% volume fraction of TiO2 in anatase crystal configuration,39,40 and 50% of dye. The optical properties of the dye were modeled based on experimental values from Nazeeruddin et al.8,9 This active layer was covered with H2O as an optical approximation of the experimental electrolyte. Light absorption in TiO2 nanostructures is known to be strongly shape dependent12,41,42 but has not yet been comparatively investigated for the presented nanocones and nanocylinders (more details on the procedures is given in the ESI†).
We observe in our simulations that the total absorption of solar light is almost the same for the coated nanotube cone and the nanotube cylinder system (see Fig. 3d), which is well in line with the results of Fig. 2f and can be understood as the total amount of dye in these systems was experimentally observed to be equal (see Fig. 2, Table 1). However, the spatial distribution of the light and consequently of the absorbed power is very different (Fig. 3a and b, right). When the light encounters the top boundary at z = 13 μm, 20–40% of the incident power is absorbed in the top cover layer of dye. This factor strongly depends on the exact geometry parameters, but there is no difference between cones and cylinders, and the absorption takes place at maximum distance from the bottom electrode (z = 13 μm).
The major difference between cones and cylinders occurs during the propagation of light through the L = 13 μm of the active layer formed by the array of nanotubes (Fig. 3c). The material cross section of the cylinder stays nearly the same over this range, while that of the cones increases. The effect is a nearly constant differential power absorption in the cylinder system (Fig. 3c blue), while the differential power absorption in the cones increases towards the bottom electrode (Fig. 3c orange) adiabatically. The measured electron transfer times are shorter in case of the cones, which also indicates a more pronounced conversion close to the bottom electrode as discussed above. This is in accordance with recent observations by Zhu et al. on the reduced reflectivity of Si nanocone arrays, compared with nanowires43 and with results by Buencuerpo et al.44 Close to the bottom Ti electrode both absorptions reach an enhanced maximum. In other words, the main difference between the decorated cone and cylinder structure is, that maximum light absorption occurs in the cones much closer to the back electrode than in the corresponding cylinder geometry. Hence a larger amount of charge carriers is injected to the TiO2 closer to the back electrode, i.e. carriers experience a short resistance path before being collected at the back contact and therefore an overall lower loss is observed.12,45 This is reflected in a higher IPCE efficiency of the solar cell and an average faster transport time. We therefore suggest that the increased efficiency of the cone system over that of the cylinder system is substantially caused by a shift of the absorption towards the bottom electrode for the cones.
Our hypothesis is supported by the observation of the same characteristic in the spectral absorption (Fig. 2g), i.e. the total spectral absorption for incident solar radiation (normalized to the total integrated solar power) in the cylinder system and the cone system is nearly identical (closed curve). Even more importantly, the experimentally measured IPCE efficiency of the cylinder system (Fig. 2g, Cy(T)) coincides with the calculated spectral absorption maximum. By analyzing the evolution of the spectral absorption along z we observe that the absorption in the cone system outperforms that in the cylinders already for an integrated absorption below z = 6 μm (Fig. 3d, dashed curves). Furthermore we observe that the spectral absorption broadens in that range and increasingly resembles the experimental IPCE efficiency of the cones (Fig. 2g, Con(T)).
Overall, the present work shows that conical TiO2 nanotubes can lead to a significant enhancement in the solar light conversion efficiency in TiO2 nanotube based DSSCs compared with classical cylindrical tubes. Simulations using electromagnetic finite difference time domain (FDTD) modelling show that the key reason for this improvement is the light absorption profile in cone tubes that allows for a higher amount of carriers being generated closer to the back-contact. The improved IPCE and faster average carrier transport times result in an improved efficiency of the solar cells by ≈60% – leading to one of the highest values observed for back-side illuminated Grätzel type cells of ≈8%.
