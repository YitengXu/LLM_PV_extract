    , Accepted 24th June 2022First published on 24th June 2022AbstractThe electrochemical ammonia synthesis is an environmentally friendly method for ammonia production; however, it is still impeded by the bottleneck of N2 activation and challenging hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). A rational design for developing efficient electrocatalysts by tuning the surface electronic state is regarded as a promising strategy to overcome these obstacles. Herein, we report a phosphorus-doped potassium peroxyniobate (KNb3O8, denoted as P-KNO) electrocatalyst with enriched oxygen vacancies to effectively improve N2-to-NH3 efficiency and suppress HER. Such P-KNO electrocatalyst achieves a rate of 23.01 μg h−1 mgcat−1 for NH3 production at −0.45 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and a faradaic efficiency (FE) of 39.77% at −0.4 VRHE in a 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, which is about twice that of the non-modified KNb3O8 (denoted as KNO, 11.35 μg h−1 mgcat−1, 19.60%) counterpart under the same condition. Moreover, the resultant P-KNO electrocatalyst renders steady NH3 yield amounts and selectivity in cycling tests for 10 h. It is concluded that the enhanced N2 fixation activity and faradaic efficiency are ascribed to the phosphorus doping and formation of oxygen vacancies, which not only make the surface of the electrocatalyst highly hydrophobic but also adjust the surface electronic structure of potassium niobate, thus resulting in accelerated N2 adsorption and activation during the NRR process. This electrocatalyst with phosphorus-doping and oxygen vacancies gives deep insights into the rational regulation of the surface electronic state of NRR electrocatalysts for efficient NH3 synthesis.
Introduction
Ammonia (NH3), one of the most important chemical raw materials, is widely used in national defense, coatings, pharmaceutical, synthetic fibers and fertilizer fields.1–3 In addition, NH3 is also a carbon-free energy carrier with great potential in the future energy economy.4 Up to now, industrial ammonia is mainly produced by the Haber–Bosch process, which is usually carried out under harsh conditions of high temperatures (400–550 °C) and high pressure (200–350 atm).5,6 In this case, the industrial NH3 synthesis consumes about 2% of the global total energy consumption and emits about 1.5% of the world total carbon dioxide emissions annually.7–10 Therefore, it is highly urgent and important to develop an energy-efficient and environmental-friendly substitute technology for ammonia production.11
Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) for NH3 production is one of the most promising alternative routes to the energy-intensive Haber–Bosch process owing to its features of cleanliness, high efficiency and sustainability. Nevertheless, due to the lack of effective electrocatalysts, the research for NH3 yield and faradaic efficiency (FE) is still far from the theoretical target, which is also the main challenge of electrochemical NRR.12–14 To date, only a few noble metal catalysts including Ru, Pd, Rh and Au have demonstrated state-of-the-art electrocatalytic NRR activities due to the excellent electronic conductivity and favoured electronic structure.15–20 However, the practical application of noble metal catalysts for NRR is dramatically limited by their high price and scarcity. It is of great significance to develop low-cost transition metal-based electrocatalysts towards highly efficient NRR activities. Among these noble-metal-free catalysts, d-zone transition metals (d-TMs) and their corresponding oxides, nitrides, sulfides as well as carbides have been studied and achieved relatively ideal electrocatalytic NRR properties due to the unfilled valence layer d orbitals of d-TMs.21–24 It is accepted that the empty d orbital of d-TMs atoms can accept a lone pair electron of N2 to strengthen the metal–nitrogen bond, so as to enhance the absorption of N2. Furthermore, d-TM atoms can also contribute the separated d orbital electrons to the antibonding orbital of the N2 molecule to weaken the NN bond,25 thus making N2 easy to decompose.
As one of the typical d-TMs, niobium (Nb) is located at the top of volcanic map for NRR, which may drive the NRR to form NH3 through association mechanism.26 The d orbital of Nb has four single electrons and one vacant orbital, endowing the niobium element with polyvalent states from zero to +3 and +5, which has great potential for NRR applications.12,26 For example, Sun et al. reported that Nb2O5 nanofibers are capable of realizing a NH3 yield rate of 43.6 μg h−1 mgcat−1 at −0.55 VRHE with a FE of 9.26% in 0.1 M HCl.27 Zheng et al. demonstrated that NbO2 nanoparticles achieved a NH3 production rate of 11.6 μg h−1 mgcat−1 at 0.65 VRHE and presented a peak FE of 32% at 0.60 VRHE.28 Nonetheless, the potential application of Nb-based NRR electrocatalysts is still affected by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the resulting low faradaic efficiency. Fortunately, it has been revealed that the incorporation of Li+ into the catalyst can retard HER and favour N2 adsorption during the NRR process.29 Coincidentally, such a phenomenon has been reported in a more recent study by adding K+ into an acidic electrolyte to suppress HER during the CO2 reduction reaction process.30 K+ also made a significant contribution to large-scale energy storage systems and it has wide application in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Existing studies have shown that K+ can passivate defects and optimize interfaces to improve power conversion efficiency (PCE).31–33 For example, Luo et al. doped potassium cinnamate (PC) into a perovskite precursor solution. This strategy enhances the quality of the film, passivates defects and advances the photoluminescence intensity.34 Hou et al. used KCl as a seed crystal to guide the formation of FAPbI3, which promoted the photovoltaic efficiency of SnO2/KCl solar cells from 19.51% to 20.56%.35 Bi et al. reported that a multifunctional buffer molecule (oteracil potassium, OP) can restrain the lag and passivation defects of methylamine-free PSCs. This made the PCE value of the OP-modified device exceed 22%.36 Moreover, tuning the surface electronic state gave us another strategy to promote the N2 activation and retard the side reaction of hydrogen evolution.
Inspired by this, potassium peroxyniobate (KNb3O8, denotes as KNO), which usually operates in photo-/catalysis as an active semiconductor or support and optical material, was proposed as active and efficient NRR electrocatalysts for the first time by the following strategy: a KNO catalyst was synthesized via a simple solid-state method, followed by introducing phosphorus-doping and modifying abundant oxygen vacancies through the pyrolysis of NaH2PO2. Detailed electrochemical tests implied that the resultant P-KNO electrocatalyst achieves a rate of 23.01 μg h−1 mgcat−1 for NH3 production at −0.45 VRHE and a FE of 39.77% at −0.4 VRHE in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte, which is about twice that of the non-modified KNO (11.35 μg h−1 mgcat−1, 19.60%) counterpart under the same condition.
Experimental
Reagents and materials
Niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5), potassium carbonate (K2CO3), sodium dihydrogen phosphite (NaH2PO2), hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O), sodium nitroferricyanide (C5FeN6Na2O·2H2O), p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (C9H11NO), salicylic acid (C7H6O3), sodium citrate dehydrates (C6H5Na3O7·2H2O), ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), ammonium chloride-15N (15NH4Cl), sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), heavy water (D2O), hydrochloric acid (HCl) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) were purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). Hydrogen dioxide (H2O2), ethanol, and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. LTD. A Nafion® N-117 membrane and Nafion solution (5 wt%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar Chemical Co. LTD. A conductive carbon paper was purchased from Toray Corporation, Japan. N2 (99.999%), 15N2 (99.999%) and Ar (99.999%) were purchased from Taiyuan Anxuhongyun Technology Development Co. LTD. Ultra-pure water used in all experiments was purified by a Millipore system.
Preparation of the KNO electrocatalyst
KNO was synthesized by a solid phase reaction process: first, a certain weight of K2CO3 and Nb2O5 with a molar ratio of 1:3 into a mortar was taken, and then the mixture was ground for more than 10 min. After that, the mixture was transferred into a porcelain boat and heated at 600 °C for 2 h and 900 °C for another 3 h in a muffle furnace at a rate of 5 °C min−1 under air atmosphere. Finally, KNO was obtained by cooling the sample naturally to room temperature.
Preparation of the P-KNO electrocatalyst
P-KNO was prepared by a gas solid reaction method. Typically, 100 mg of KNb3O8 was put on the outlet side and 1 g of NaH2PO2 on the inlet side of a porcelain boat, and then the porcelain boat was taken into the tubular furnace, as shown in Fig. S1.† Then, the sample was annealed at 300 °C for 3 h under N2 atmosphere. The cooled sample was washed with ultrapure water/ethanol several times and dried at 80 °C overnight.
Characterizations
A Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer, Cu Kα with a wavelength of 0.15418 nm, was used to scan the catalysts at a scanning rate of 5° min−1 in the range of 5°–80°. The morphology and structure of the samples were characterized on a Hitachi SU8010 field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) and IXRF SDD 3360 X-ray energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The operating voltages were set at 3 kV and 15 kV, respectively. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was performed at 200 kV using a field emission transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Tecnai G2 F30). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, VG ESCALAB250) was used to analyse the elemental composition, content and chemical valence state of the sample surface. The unpaired electrons contained in atoms or molecules of catalysts were detected by an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer (EPR, Bruker A300). 14NH4+ and 15NH4+ products were identified on a liquid nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer (1H NMR, Bruker AVANCE AV III 400).
Results and discussion
XRD patterns were obtained to investigate the structure of KNO and P-KNO samples. According to XRD patterns in Fig. 1a, except for some miscellaneous peaks of Nb oxidized species, the other XRD peaks of KNO correspond well to KNb3O8 standard card (JCPDS No. 38-0296). After phosphatizing, it is found that XRD peaks of the P-KNO sample correspond well with KNb3O8 standard card, and no diffraction peak of P appears, which can be due to the low doping amount of phosphorus. It is suggested that the reducing gas generated by the decomposition of NaH2PO2 (reaction formula (1)) only reacts with KNO on the surface during the phosphating process, which only modifies the surface of the catalyst and does not change the crystal structure of KNO. Through reading the literature, we made a reasonable conjecture that the catalyst formed a P–O–Nb bond during the phosphating process.37–39 2NaH2PO2 = PH3(g) + Na2HPO4(1)

As shown in the SEM image in Fig. 1b, it can be observed that the morphology of P-KNO is a block with irregular shape, which is well inherited from that of KNO sample (Fig. S2†). The corresponding EDS elemental mapping images reveal the homogeneous distribution of P, K, Nb and O elements within P-KNO (Fig. 1c–f). The existence of the P element proves the successful doping of P in the KNO sample during the phosphating process. The massive body of P-KNO can be clearly seen in the TEM image (Fig. S3† and Fig. 1g), which is also consistent with the irregular block shape of KNO (Fig. S4a†). Furthermore, as depicted by the HRTEM image in Fig. 1h, it is demonstrated that the lattice spacing of 0.276 nm can be indexed to the (260) crystal plane of KNO, which is in good agreement with the result of XRD. Moreover, in contrast to the pristine KNO (Fig. S4b†), the part circled in the red box in Fig. 1h shows that P-KNO has numerous lattice defects, which could be caused by phosphorus-doping and abundant oxygen vacancies. Contact angle measurements (Fig. S5†) reveal that the contact angle changes from 124.5° to 133.3° before and after phosphating, indicating that the P-KNO sample has better hydrophobic characteristics. It is well known that adjusting the surface wettability may be beneficial to the enrichment of N2 molecules on the surface of the catalyst, thus accelerating the electrocatalytic NRR.3
XPS was employed to explore the influence of the phosphating process on the surface composition and electronic structure of each element. As demonstrated by the full XPS spectra of KNO and P-KNO in Fig. S6a,† Nb 3d, O 1s and K 2p peaks can be detected in both KNO and P-KNO catalysts. After phosphatizing, the peak of P 2p can also be detected in the full XPS spectrum of P-KNO, further proving the successful doping of P element into the KNO sample. The high-resolution P 2p spectrum of the P-KNO sample shows the binding energy corresponding to P–O at 134.2 eV and 133.5 eV (Fig. 2a), which was caused by the oxidation of phosphating compounds into phosphate on the surface. The binding energy peak of K 2p of P-KNO (Fig. 2b) can be fitted to 294.43 eV (corresponding to K 2p3/4) and 291.66 eV (corresponding to K 2p1/2). As shown in Fig. 2c, the peaks of Nb 3d at 209.2 eV and 206.5 eV correspond to the characteristic peaks of 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 orbits, in which the fitted peaks of 209.78 eV and 207.07 eV corresponding to Nb5+ ions and the refined peaks of 209.13 eV and 206.44 eV ascribe to Nb4+ ions.40 In the O 1s spectrum of P-KNO (Fig. 2d), the peak at 529.4 eV is assigned to the characteristic lattice oxygen (OL) of potassium niobate and the peak at 530.7 eV indexes to the surface adsorbed oxygen or oxygen vacancy (OV).41 As shown in Fig. S6b,† the proportion of oxygen vacancy in P-KNO is calculated to be 56%, which is much higher than that of the KNO sample (7.1%). Moreover, a strong resonance signal can be detected at g = 2.0 in the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum of P-KNO (Fig. S7†), which is caused by the transfer of electrons from oxygen vacancies to the adjacent Nb5+ during the process of electrostatic equilibrium, resulting in the formation of Nb4+. It is confirmed that Nb4+ ions (4d0 5s1) have also a single electron in addition to the vacant d orbital, which is more conducive to nitrogen absorption and weakening of NN tri-bonds.42,43

In order to verify the advantage of P-doping and oxygen vacancies towards electrocatalytic NRR, the electrochemical N2 fixation activities of KNO and P-KNO catalysts were analysed in a three-electrode system with a platinum net as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and a carbon paper coated with catalyst as the working electrode (see ESI Experimental section in ESI, Fig. S8†).44 As shown in Fig. 3a, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was performed in 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte saturated with high-purity argon and high-purity nitrogen, respectively. It can be found that the current density obtained under nitrogen saturation is higher than that of argon saturation in the range of −0.35 VRHE–0.80 VRHE, demonstrating that the electrocatalytic NRR also occurred in addition to HER on the P-KNO electrode.45 The curves of i-t at different potentials between −0.35 VRHE and −0.55 VRHE were also recorded, and the ammonia produced during the process is quantified by the colour reaction between the cathode electrolyte after electrolysis and the chromogenic agent (Fig. S9†). As shown in Fig. 3b, the current densities at different potentials remain stable after 2 h NRR electrolysis and increase with the increment in the potentials. Moreover, it can be seen from the UV spectrum (Fig. 3c) that the absorbance of the cathodic chamber electrolyte is the highest under the potential of −0.45 VRHE. According to the corresponding numerical calculation in Fig. 3b and c, the NH3 yield rate and FE of the P-KNO catalyst under each potential can be obtained. As depicted in Fig. 3d, the NH3 yield rate and FE of the P-KNO catalyst show a volcanic trend in the range of −0.35 VRHE–0.55 VRHE. The optimal FE is 39.77% at −0.40 VRHE and the optimal NH3 yield is 23.01 μg h−1 mgcat−1 at −0.45 VRHE. These results are superior to most of the transition metal-based NRR electrocatalysts reported (see Table S1 in the ESI†).

The stability of the catalyst is also an important index to evaluate the NRR performance.46 In this case, the electrocatalytic NRR activities within 2 h under the optimal potential of −0.45 VRHE of the same P-KNO electrode were carried out for 5 cycles. Within the allowable error range, if the change of NH3 and FE is small, the good stability of the catalyst can be proved. As shown in Fig. 4a, in five consecutive cyclic stability tests (a total of 10 h), the current density maintains stable and basically unchanged in each cycle (Fig. S10a†). As expected, UV–vis absorbance curves of the electrolyte obtained after each cycle test are fundamentally the same after color reaction (Fig. S10b†), implying that NH3 yield and FE varied slightly. In the five repeated experiments, the yield of NH3 is 23.01 μg h−1 mgcat−1, 22.42 μg h−1 mgcat−1, 19.93 μg h−1 mgcat−1, 20.01 μg h−1 mgcat−1, 21.35 μg h−1 mgcat−1, which may be in the process of electrolysis, the electrolyte absorbs a small amount of ammonia from the air. FE is 39.77%, 28.86%, 38.45%, 38.22%, and 33.56%, which may be related to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode used. The actual condition of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode will affect FE. Therefore, the saturated potassium chloride solution in the reference electrode needs to be replaced every two weeks during the experiment to reduce the experimental error. The NH3 yield and FE remain basically unchanged (Fig. 4a), which proves that the resultant P-KNO catalyst has good cyclic stability towards electrocatalytic NRR. Furthermore, to illustrate that the produced ammonia comes from the continuous reduction of nitrogen, the P-KNO electrode was further tested in the N2-saturated electrolyte at open circuit potential and Ar-saturated electrolyte at −0.45 VRHE, respectively. For purposes of comparison, the NRR performances of bare carbon paper (CP) were also carried out. As shown by UV–vis spectra in Fig. 4b, the generation of ammonia can be only detected by the P-KNO electrode under the condition of saturated N2 at −0.45 VRHE, indicating that the NH3 product was mainly generated from the feeding of N2. The results of UV–vis spectrophotometry of N-(1-naphthalene) ethylenediamine hydrochloride spectrophotometry showed that there was no NO2− contamination in the test environment (Fig. S11†). No NO3− was detected by UV–vis spectrophotometry directly (Fig. S12†). In order to further verify the origin of NH3, we carried out the 15N2 isotope labelling experiment at −0.45 VRHE. 15N2 and 14N2 were used as the feed gas, respectively. After 2 h electrolysis of the electrolyte, the 1H NMR spectrum test was carried out. As shown in Fig. 4c, the electrolyte with 15N2 as the feed gas detected two symmetric peaks with the peak spacing of 72 Hz, which was consistent with the standard 15NH4+ sample. Three peaks were detected in the electrolyte with 14N2 as the feed gas and their peak spacing was 52 Hz, which was also consistent with the standard 14NH4+ sample. It is worth noting that the peak of 14NH4+ is also detected in Fig. S13,† which is caused by the absorption of a small amount of NH3 in air by sulfuric acid when adjusting the PH of the electrolyte and has been deducted in the calculation process. The NH3 yield calculated by the 1H NMR spectrum is 20.25 μg h−1 mgcat−1, which is close to that calculated by the indophenol blue method (Fig. 4d). These results strongly demonstrate that NH3 is produced by the NRR process rather than from catalysts, electrolytes or other contaminants. Furthermore, the electrocatalytic NRR performances of P-KNO and KNO in N2-saturated 0.1 M Na2SO4 at the potential of −0.45 VRHE were also investigated. It is demonstrated that P-KNO has higher current density and lower peak potential than that of KNO (Fig. S14†), indicating that P-KNO has better NRR activity. Not surprisingly, the measured UV–vis absorbance of P-KNO was also higher than that of KNO after 2 h of electrolysis at −0.45 VRHE (Fig. S15†). Consistently, the NH3 yield and FE of P-KNO (23.01 μg h−1 mgcat−1, 39.77%) are about twice that of KNO (11.35 μg h−1 mgcat−1, 19.60%). Moreover, as shown in Fig. S16 and Fig. S17,† hydrazine hydrate in the electrolyte after 2 h of electrolysis was not detected, clarifying the absence of hydrazine during the NRR process. It could also be preliminarily inferred that the NRR process acted by the P-KNO catalyst followed the distal association mechanism. According to the results of these comparative experiments, it can be concluded that the enhanced NRR activity and selectivity of the P-KNO catalyst attribute to the formation of Nb4+ and oxygen vacancies by the doping of phosphorus, which makes the catalyst surface more hydrophobic and more conducive to nitrogen absorption as well as weakening of NN tri-bonds.

Conclusions
In brief, the P-KNO catalyst with abundant oxygen vacancies was synthesized via a simple solid-state method and followed the phosphating process. It is found that the phosphating process not only dopes P into the KNO catalyst but also leads to the formation of Nb4+ and abundant oxygen vacancies, which could reconstruct the surface electronic structure, thus facilitating nitrogen adsorption as well as activation. Detailed electrochemical characterizations demonstrate that the resultant P-KNO has better electrocatalytic NRR activities (23.01 μg h−1 mgcat−1, 39.77%) with good stability, selectivity and repeatability than that of the pristine KNO catalyst (11.35 μg h−1 mgcat−1, 19.60%). This study paves an effective strategy to rational tune the surface electronic state of electrocatalysts with atom doping and oxygen vacancies formation towards efficient electrocatalytic NRR under mild conditions.
