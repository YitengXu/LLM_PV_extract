Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted much attention in the past two decades as alternatives to conventional silicon solar cells.1–3 Efficiencies of up to 11.1% and 12.3% have been obtained employing iodide/triiodide and [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) redox mediators, respectively.4,5 Since the ultimate goal of DSC research is to facilitate the commercialization and large scale deployment of DSCs, the widely used organic solvents, such as acetonitrile and 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN), have the potential drawbacks of volatility and fluidity, which could result in evaporation and leakage during long-term usage. DSCs based on a gel electrolyte can compete with liquid DSCs in terms of energy conversion efficiencies and, importantly, they have been reported to exhibit better long-term stability.6 Among them, polymer gel electrolytes are of particular interest due to the facile preparation and modification as well as excellent liquid trapping capability. For example, use of a poly-(β-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-based organogel capable of forming network structure in a binary solvent led to a 7.5% DSC efficiency.7 Poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) based MPN quasi-solid state DSCs have been reported with efficiencies exceeding 6% and good long term stability.8 Recently, Chen et al. reported that the in situ gelation of an electrolyte comprising poly(acrylonitrile-co-vinyl acetate) (PAN-VA) and acetonitrile resulted in a DSC efficiency of 9.0% without the TiO2 nanofiller and 9.5% with the TiO2 nanofiller.9 To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency that has been reported for a polymer gel based DSC at 1 sun illumination.
In comparison to iodine/triiodide, one-electron cobalt(II)/(III) redox couples possess the advantage of non-corrosiveness and negligible visible absorption.10–12 Recent reports have announced some spectacular advances achieved through the application of the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ couple in DSCs.5,13,14 We have shown that the potential of the redox mediators can be fine-tuned in situ by using the cobalt(II)/(III) complexes of a pentadentate ligand, achieving an efficiency of 8.4% in combination with MK2, a dye possessing alkyl chains on the conjugated thiophene linker and a high molar extinction coefficient.15 We have also reported DSCs based on a [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ aqueous electrolyte with an efficiency of 5%.16 In the case of cobalt electrolytes, stability testing was reported over a period of 200 h of illumination.5 Gelation offers the advantage of minimizing electrolyte leakage while maintaining good contact between the dyed porous TiO2 film and redox mediator in the electrolyte. To date, however, there is only one publication reporting the application of a cobalt gel electrolyte.17 By using nanoparticles to ‘solidify’ the liquid cobalt electrolyte, DSCs with 2.6% efficiency at 1 sun and 4.0% at 0.1 sun were obtained.
The successful application of PVDF-HFP in DSC polymer gel electrolytes containing the iodine/iodide redox couple,18 led us to explore the development of a [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ (Fig. 1a) redox couple based polymer gel electrolyte. We report that the application of this new electrolyte results in DSCs with energy conversion efficiency of 8.7% at 1 sun and 10% at 0.1 sun. Moreover, we demonstrate that these gel-based DSCs exhibit excellent stability when compared to the equivalent liquid DSCs.

Cobalt gel electrolytes with 4–10 wt% of PVDF-HFP in acetonitrile were incorporated into DSCs to examine the influence of the polymer content on DSC performance. The PVDF-HFP is very soluble in acetonitrile, forming a gel over a period of hours. Rheological characterization (Fig. S1, ESI†) showed that the addition of even 4 wt% of PVDF-HFP already assists in the formation of the viscous gel structure and, thus, this mixture can be applied as a gel electrolyte matrix. A backfilling technique was used to inject the liquid electrolyte into the device after heating, which allows sufficient time to ensure good penetration of the electrolyte into the pores of the mesoporous TiO2 film prior to the in situ gelation inside the pores. This greatly enhances the interfacial contact between the electrolyte and the mesoporous photoanode. The gelation time was dependent on the polymer content, requiring 5 h when 4 wt% PVDF-HFP was added into the electrolyte and less than 30 min when 10 wt% was added.
The I–V data for DSCs incorporating solvent and gel-based electrolytes are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. S2 (ESI†). All the DSCs were assembled from 6 μm thick transparent TiO2 which yielded the highest photovoltaic performance when used in conjugation with a 4% PVDF-HFP electrolyte (see Table S1 and Fig. S3, ESI†). To our surprise, a liquid electrolyte based device achieves an efficiency of 10% with MK2 dye (Fig. 1b) as the sensitizer at 1 sun light intensity, which is much higher than the best reported efficiency of 7.4% for devices employing this commercial sensitizer and the same cobalt redox shuttle.15 For devices constructed with 4% polymer in the electrolyte, efficiencies of 8.7% were measured, the highest efficiency achieved so far for DSCs based on a cobalt gel electrolyte. Under full sun illumination, decreases in the short circuit current (Jsc), as well as the fill factor (FF), were observed when the polymer content was increased to 10%. The open circuit voltage (VOC), on the other hand, is unaffected by the amount of polymer added. In order to understand if the amount of polymer affects the diffusion of the redox species in the gel electrolyte, I–V data were also collected at 0.1 sun. The photovoltaic performance for the polymer-free and polymer containing electrolytes at low illumination levels was unaffected by the addition of up to 10 wt% of polymer, yielding a constant power conversion efficiency of 10%. This is the highest efficiency reported to date for quasi-solid state DSCs at 0.1 sun illumination. Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements suggested identical IPCE behavior with a broad plateau at 75% in the 400–600 nm range, indicating excellent light harvesting in this wavelength region (Fig. S4, ESI†).

During DSC operation, the reduced and oxidized species of the mediator need to diffuse between the two electrodes to support ionic charge transport within the cell, resulting in a net transport of electrons from the counter electrode to the photo-oxidized dye on the working electrode. The diffusion of these charge carriers is greatly affected by the viscosity of the electrolyte and, in turn, affects device performance. In order to understand the diffusion characteristics of the redox couple, diffusion-limited dark current measurements were conducted to determine the apparent diffusion coefficient (Dapp) of the CoII/CoIII redox mediator in the polymer electrolytes according to eqn (1):19 
Dapp = Jlimd/(2nFC)
(1)where Jlim is the limiting current density, d is the distance between the two electrodes, F is the Faraday constant, C is the bulk concentration of the diffusion-limiting species and n = 1, the number of electrons transferred in the Co3+ + e− → Co2+ redox reaction. The Co(II)/Co(III) ratio in the electrolyte was varied and it was found that the component with the lower concentration always gave a smaller limiting current and is thus the diffusion-determining species, in these diffusion-controlled redox mediator systems (Fig. S5, ESI†).17 The data for the liquid and gel electrolytes are summarized in Table 1 (right hand column). Compared to the liquid electrolyte (Dapp = 1.39 × 10−6 cm2 s−1), the diffusion coefficient of [Co(bpy)3]3+ in a 4% polymer electrolyte decreases by 30% and by 50% when 10% polymer is added. Thus, an increase in the polymer content reduces the [Co(bpy)3]3+ diffusion rate (Fig. 2a), slowing down the regeneration of [Co(bpy)3]2+.

The effect of PVDF-HFP on mass transport in the DSCs was further studied by monitoring photocurrent transients employing a modulation (on/off) of the incident light.20 In the absence of mass transport problems, when the light is switched on the photocurrent should rapidly reach a maximum and remain constant thereafter. In our case, this condition is satisfied at low light intensity (10% and 32.5% sun), whereas even in the absence of any PVDF-HFP it takes a few seconds to reach a steady current at 1 sun (Fig. 2b). As the amount of PVDF-HFP is increased, the observed current spike increases and the steady state photocurrent gradually decreases, indicating that the polymer retards the charge carrier transport in the electrolyte and limits the photocurrent generation, as discussed above.
The DSCs were evaluated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The chemical capacitance (Cμ) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) between the electrolyte and the working electrode obtained from the fitting of EIS curves are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The charge transfer resistances at the TiO2 and electrolyte interface are nearly identical regardless of the polymer content, indicating that the electron lifetimes are similar, which is in keeping with the measured Voc values. The similar chemical capacitances suggest a similar density of state distribution and a negligible TiO2 conduction band shift. These findings show that the introduction of PVDF-HFP does not affect the contact at the TiO2–electrolyte interface.
The effect of the PVDF-HFP-content on the stability of DSCs was examined by comparing the performance of devices made with 4% polymer and without polymer in the electrolyte under continuous 1 sun illumination by white light LEDs (see Fig. 3). The gel devices were found to retain 90% of their initial efficiency after illumination for nearly 700 h, confirming the outstanding stability of the cobalt gel electrolyte based devices. In contrast, the liquid polymer-free electrolyte based devices maintained 90% of the initial efficiency for less than 200 h and the efficiency dropped to 25% of its original value after 500 h. The photovoltaic performance parameters clearly indicate that the dramatic drop of the liquid device efficiency is mainly caused by a decrease in Jsc, which could be attributed to the partial evaporation of the solvent, leading to a reduced contact area and an increase in the viscosity arising from an increase in the concentration of the electrolyte components.

In conclusion, we have developed a cobalt gel electrolyte based DSCs with an impressive energy conversion efficiency of 8.7% under 1 sun illumination and an even higher efficiency of 10% under 0.1 sun illumination. This is the highest energy conversion efficiency reported to date for a DSC based on a cobalt gel electrolyte. Measurements of the apparent diffusion coefficient of [Co(bpy3)]3+ and transient photocurrents show that mass transport through the device limits the performance at 1 sun when the polymer is introduced into liquid electrolyte. In the future, optimization of the photoanode structure needs to be carried out in order to improve the diffusion of the redox species through the gel state electrolyte. Importantly, introduction of the polymer into the liquid electrolyte significantly improved the long-term stability, with the gel state devices maintaining 90% of the initial efficiency after 700 h continuous illumination. We believe that this study will stimulate the application of stable cobalt gel electrolytes in large DSC module fabrication.
