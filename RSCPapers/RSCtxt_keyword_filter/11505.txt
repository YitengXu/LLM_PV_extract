    , Accepted 28th January 2016First published on 28th January 2016AbstractPolycrystalline semiconductor films of BiCdTe composites were electro-deposited on ITO coated glass through a voltammetric technique under variable periodic cycles. The crystal structure and composition of the films were determined by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray analysis and the optical features were recorded using a UV-visible spectrometer. The band gap energy of the ternary films was found to be within the range of 1.5–1.7 eV. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy provided important information regarding the interfacial properties of the films in polysulphide medium. The current–voltage measurements for the photo-electrochemical solar cells fabricated with the prepared films as anode components exhibited encouraging photo-response and improved functional properties. The BiCdTe composite films were further subjected to anodic corrosion studies followed by anodic stripping voltammetry and the stability of the films was compared with that of CdTe. An optimal composition of the film matrix shows a performance efficiency of 4.3%, significantly high photo current and considerably greater stability compared to the individual binary chalcogenide films.
1. Introduction
The choice of materials plays an important role in developing photoelectrochemical cells for harvesting energy from a significant part of the solar spectrum. The major issues are concerned with improving the conversion efficiency by selecting proper electrode–electrolyte combinations, developing new semiconductor materials with desirable surface properties, intrinsic control over recombination and reduced manufacturing costs. Since the last decade the n-type chalcogenide materials have been of extensive interest because of their application as photo-anodes in solid state photovoltaic and liquid junction solar cells.1–4 Consequently, efforts are in progress to enhance the functional properties of the Gr (II–V–VI) compound/composite materials on the nanoscale using various synthetic approaches.5–10 In fact, the inter-combination of these compounds often produces attractive multi-elemental systems with controlled band width depending upon the selective choice of materials and their compositional variation. In this respect bismuth and cadmium chalcogenide compounds are considered to be excellent candidates for thin film optoelectronic appliances4,11 and are known to improve the photo-conversion efficiency by reducing the charge recombination.12 Several other reports are available on the fabrication of photo-anodes employing combined chalcogenide materials like Cd(S1−xSex),13 PbS–ZnO,14 CdS–CdTe,15,16 Bi2Te3/Bi2S3,17 Bi2Te3−xSex18,19 and so on. Such systems may also incorporate wide band gap oxides as buffer layers for creating desired space charge regions in the matrix. In particular, Bi2Te3 and its derivative compounds are very attractive materials for use in thermoelectric devices and sensors due to their thermo-electric performance.12,19 On the other hand CdTe has been regarded as a promising light harvesting material in photovoltaic applications due to its high optical absorption coefficient and band gap < 1.5 eV, preferably tuned to the solar radiation spectrum.20,21 Among various deposition methods, electrodeposition is a simple and inexpensive method for the preparation of thin films. The growth rate can be easily controlled through electrical quantities such as current density and deposition potential. The present investigation focuses on Bi and Cd chalcogenide semiconductor (SC) compounds and their combinatorial approach for electrochemically fabricating thin films with enhanced photo-electrochemical properties.
Nano-crystalline BiCdTe composite thin films have been deposited through periodic voltammetry at room temperature. The surface morphology, structure, optical properties and composition of the films were determined by the help of respective techniques. The electrochemical characterization of the films included impedance spectroscopy, Tafel analysis and anodic stripping voltammetry (ASV). Finally the photo-electrochemical performance was validated through the current–potential measurements under dark and illuminated conditions.
2. Experimental
2.1. Fabrication of the semiconductor films
The BiCdTe composite films were grown on a conducting glass substrate, ITO (indium doped SnO2, Xinyan, Hong Kong) using the voltammetric technique from the precursor bath containing 0.01 (M) Cd(NO3)2, 0.001 (M) Bi(NO3)3 and 0.001 (M) TeO2 in aqueous HNO3 (pH 2) medium with continuous purging of N2 gas. For better adherence of the film onto the ITO substrate, neutral surfactant TX-100 (0.5%) was used in the bath.4 The electro deposition was carried out at room temperature in a typical three electrode assembly cell comprising of the ITO substrate as the working electrode, calomel as the reference electrode and Pt foil as the counter electrode under controlled voltammetric cycles ranging between 100–1000, within the potential window of 0.0 to −1.0 V at a scan rate of 400 mV s−1 using AUTOLAB 30, Metrohm Autolab B.V (The Netherlands).
2.2. Morphology, structure and spectral information
The surface crystallinity of the films was studied by the help of a Philips PW 1710, X-ray diffractometer using CuKα radiation of wavelength 1.542 Å and operated at 25 kV and 20 mA within the 2θ range of angles between 20° to 90° and 2θ increment of 0.02°. The morphological information was obtained from SEM analysis employing a JEOL JSM-6700F FESEM. AFM analyses were carried out in air under ambient conditions (25 °C) using a Dimension 3100 Atomic Force Microscope (Vecco II, USA). Topographic (2D and 3D, height) images were recorded in the non-contact mode using an etched silicon probe. The scan area was 10 μm × 10 μm and the image contained 256 × 256 data points.
The band gap of each of the as deposited BiCdTe film was derived from the differential plot of the transmittance recorded in a JASCO V-530 UV-VIS-NIR Spectrometer, Japan, in the spectral range of 350 to 1100 nm. The electrodeposited films were subjected to the study of dielectric properties by measuring the capacitance (C) within the frequency (ω) range of 0.5–200 kHz, under a constant bias of 1.0 V by the help of an Agilent 4284A Precision LCR Meter.
2.3. Polarization studies and anodic stripping voltammetry
Potentiodynamic polarization studies were carried out in an aqueous environment in a typical 3-electrode assembly cell comprising of the SC films having 1 cm2 exposed surface as the anode, calomel as the reference electrode and Pt foil as the counter electrode, by the help of an AUTOLAB 30 (Metrohm Autolab B.V, The Netherland). Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was recorded in a solution containing a supporting electrolyte, 0.1 M NaClO4, at a scan rate of 0.5 mV s−1 in the potential range −1.0 to +0.50 V vs. SCE (W). The corresponding Tafel plots were analyzed to evaluate the corrosion parameters like corrosion potential (Ecorr), corrosion current (Icorr) and corrosion rate (Rcorr) for each of the films.22 Following the anodic polarization, the working solutions were subjected to anodic stripping voltammetry to estimate the amount of Cd2+ and Bi3+ dissolved in the medium with the help of a 663 VA Trace Analyzer, coupled with an AUTOLAB 30 electrochemistry system by the standard addition procedure in a N2 atmosphere, using a hanging mercury drop (drop size 0.20 mm2) electrode (HMDE) as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl [3 M KCl] as the reference electrode and a large area glassy carbon as the counter electrode.
2.4. Electrochemical characterization of the electrode/electrolyte interface and I–V measurements
Investigations were made to study the interfacial properties of the electrode with the help of the same electrochemistry system combined with the frequency response analyzer (FRA) in a standard cell at room temperature using 0.5 (M) aqueous S2−–Sx2− as the redox electrolyte. The Mott–Schottky analyses were done based on capacitance measurements under oscillator frequency of 1 kHz within the potential range of −0.6 to +0.6 V. Nyquist plots were derived through EIS at the respective open circuit potentials applying sinusoidal perturbation of 5 mV amplitude over a frequency range of 0.1 MHz to 20 mHz.
The photoresponse of the films was recorded in terms of rise and decay of short-circuit current (Isc) in a typical cell configuration, ITO glass/BiCdTe/0.5 (M) S2−–Sx2−/Pt, under 50 mW cm−2 illumination using 1 kW tungsten filament light source. Potentiostatic polarization studies were conducted within the potential range of −0.5 V to +0.5 V employing a step potential of 0.1 V under dark and illuminated conditions. The photo conversion efficiencies of the PEC cell were derived under the same light illumination using the AUTOLAB system.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Development of BiCdTe composite films
The BiCdTe ternary composite films were electro-deposited on an ITO glass substrate at room temperature in the 3-electrode assembly cell using the voltammetric technique varying the periodic scans for 100, 250, 500, 750 and 1000 cycles. Fig. 1 represents the voltammograms recorded during deposition of the SC films for different periodic scans. The cathodic branch of the cyclic voltammogram shows a reduction peak in the range of −0.15 to −0.18 V,23 indicating the formation of Bi from the precursor salts while the broad plateau in the range of −0.60 to −0.70 V corresponds to the reduction of Cd2+ to Cd. In fact, the formulation and growth of the ternary matrix take place in sequential steps involving a number of competitive redox reactions and coupled chemical reactions. The reduction of the precursor initiates the nucleation of the atomic form of Cd, Bi and Te onto the glass substrate which is followed by surface diffusion of the atoms and their interactions, producing the binary compounds CdTe and Bi2Te3 as represented by the following reaction pathways.24,25 3HTeO2+ + 2Bi3+ + 9H+ + 18e− → Bi2Te3 + 6H2O(1) Cd2+ + HTeO2+ + 3H+ + 6e → CdTe + 2H2O(2)
 Fig. 1  Cyclic voltammograms for electro-deposition of BiCdTe on an ITO glass substrate. 
The probable blending of these compounds under repeated cycles often leads to the composite formation. It is also suggested that the formation of some of the intermediates facilitates the reduction reactions. Elemental Bi deposition is triggered via the formation of BiO+ (Bi3+ → BiO+ → Bi) while conversion of Te4+ to Te (Te4+ → HTeO2+ → Te) is facilitated in acid medium, as presented below: 2H+ + BiO+ + 3e → Bi + H2O (E0red = −0.07 V vs. SCE)(3) Cd2+ + 2e → Cd (E0red = −0.643 V vs. SCE)(4) 3H+ + HTeO2+ + 4e → Te + 2H2O (E0red = −0.27 V vs. SCE)(5) On the other hand repeated voltammetric cycles enforce stripping of Cd (Cd → Cd2+) from the matrix, as reflected in the anodic sweep by the oxidation peak observed at ∼−0.53 V, which is shifted towards more positive potential with successive periodic cycles due to rise in over potential with the change in surface composition of the film during the growth process. As a result Cd content decreases in the films deposited under higher cycles. In contrast, oxidation of Bi is low and it is retained in the matrix, however, with the possible formation of Bi-oxide/hydroxide or even elemental Bi. The compositional variation of the film matrices is later supported by an EDAX study.
3.2. Optical characterization
The transmittance spectra, the derivative plots and the band gap energy profile of the BiCdTe film regime are presented in Fig. 2(i) and (ii). The absorption edges of the films suffer minor shift to lower wave length with an increasing periodic cycle. This may be ascribed to the presence of high energy metal oxide, Bi2O3, as also identified in the XRD pattern of the film matrices.25 The absorption edges in the range of 750–820 nm in the transmittance spectra of the deposited composite films corresponded to band gap energy in the region of 1.55 eV to 1.65 eV.

3.3. X-Ray diffraction, surface morphology and composition of the film matrices
The crystalline nature of the films was confirmed by XRD analysis (Fig. 3). The observed Bragg's ‘d’ value was indexed with the help of JCPDS data files [JCPDS file No. 15-0770; 82-0474, 78-1793, 76-0680, 05-0640]. The h, k, l values and their corresponding probable identification are given in Table 1. The peaks arising at 23.66° (h k l = 111), 39.35° (220) and 45.25° (112) signifies the existence of CdTe as a cubic structure whereas the peak at 2θ = 27.75 indicates the formation of Bi2Te3(015) (JCPDS file No: 82-0358) in the ternary matrices. Extensive growth of (111), (015) and (220) planes are observed under 500 periodic scans and in most cases hexagonal and cubic phases are identified. Considering the intense peaks indexed with 2θ = 23.66° and 27.75°, respectively, for CdTe(111) and Bi2Te3(015) compounds, the average grain size of the composite films were calculated using Scherer's equation to be confined within 5–25 nm. In particular, the Bi compound exhibit smaller crystalline size which increases linearly with the cycle number. However, CdTe particles although grow in larger clusters, the size falls beyond 500 cycle numbers.

The ternary composite films deposited under 250 and 500 cycles are found to preserve a smooth, dense and homogeneous microcrystalline structure composed of well defined grains (<150 nm size) as represented by the typical SEM micrographs in Fig. 4(a and b). The magnified view of the images show that spherically shaped CdTe particles reside on the top surface of hexagonal and cubic nanostructures of Bi2Te3 and the higher periodic cycles allow the particles to coalesce forming larger clusters. The cross sectional SEM images, Fig. 4(c–e) of the films developed under different periodic scans show that the films become thicker with increasing periodic cycles. The thickness profile is shown in Fig. 6.

Further morphological examinations were carried out using the AFM technique. Fig. 5(a)–(d) shows 2D and 3D AFM images of BiCdTe composite films developed under 100, 250, 500 and 1000 cycles respectively. In the roughness profile (Fig. 6) of the film surface, the RMS factor increases with the periodic scan up to 500 cycles, beyond which the roughness remains almost invariable. The high roughness of the films may result in higher active area at the electrode–electrolyte interface leading to favorable electrode kinetics. This is achieved with the films developed under 500 cycles comprising of small grain size of CdTe crystals (<20 nm) blended with further small Bi2Te3 particles (<12 nm) as manifested in Fig. 6.

Fig. 7 shows the EDAX pattern which reveals that in most of the cases, the films are comparatively Bi rich, presumably due to the faster growth of Bi on the matrix at the same time depletion of Cd from the matrix, as discussed earlier. The atomic distribution in the table (inset of Fig. 7) indicates the deficit of Cd and Te in the films grown with increased number of cycles, perhaps supplemented by the oxide formation. Loss of Te from the surface was observed with multiple scans (500–1000), possibly due to H2Te formation in acidic medium as discussed in our earlier report.11

3.4. Study of dielectric properties of the films
The dielectric constants (ε) of the films were calculated on the basis of capacitance–frequency measurements. Each of the films suffers an exponential decay of ε with ω, the perturbation frequency as shown in Fig. 8. At the low frequency region ε values decline sharply indicating distortion of the oriented dipoles. An increase in loss factor at higher frequencies may be due to the series resistance of the electrodes. However, the fall is somewhat restricted in the Cd rich films developed with low periodic scans (Fig. 8, inset), attributable to greater number of orientated dipoles due to smaller crystallite size. Bulk CdTe, as reported,26 shows a high value of the dielectric constant (ε = 10.4), while in the synthesized composite matrix, Bi incorporation at lower cycles exhibits ε = 4.25 at 1 KHz. This is associated with space charge polarization and the inhomogenity in dielectric structure is presumably due to impurities, grain structure, defects and pores.27 Eventually in the present investigation, with the introduction of Bi in the matrix, the composite films grown under moderate periodic scans suffer distinct dielectric loss, which in effect, impart non-polarizable ion exchange characteristics to the electrode/electrolyte interface, contribute to the faster electron transport and thus reduce the recombination loss.

3.5. Potentiodynamic polarization and anodic stripping voltammetry
To evaluate the corrosion parameters (Ecorr and Icorr), Tafel plots (Fig. 9i and ii) are extracted from the potentiodynamic polarization studies of the composite films in aqueous medium. The corrosion rates (Rcorr), in terms of the extent of mass loss, kg cm−2 s−1 (w/t), were obtained on the basis of Faraday's law. The Rcorr values along with the Ecorr are presented in a bar plot, Fig. 9(iii), with respect to the number of voltammetric cycles and summarized in Table 2. The Rcorr values are considerably reduced for the material developed in a moderate periodic scan, however, increase with a higher periodic scan, following the order 100 < 250 > 500 < 750 ≪ 1000. This may be rationalized by the stoichiometric formation of BiCdTe within the cycle number 250–500, while at higher cycles the matrix becomes enriched with Bi. Presumably, since Bi is prone to anodic corrosion, the matrices become susceptible to corrosion attacks beyond 500 cycles due to larger Bi/Bi-oxide content. At the same time the oxide formation can create passivity in the films as identified in the anodic branch of the Tafel plots under polarized conditions.

Fig. 10(a and b) show the current–potential profile as derived from anodic stripping voltammetry for the composite film produced under 500 cycles. For Cd and Bi stripping the respective peaks appear at potentials −0.62 V and 0.04 V vs. an Ag/AgCl electrode. The quantitative estimation of the dissolved ions is made from the current–concentration profile shown in the insets of Fig. 10a and b and summarized in Table 2. Disintegration is noticeably suppressed for a Cd rich matrix while excess of Bi was stripped out of the matrix. With the voltammetric cycles around 500, composition of the film approaches stoichiometric ratio and Cd is prevented from leaching out of the matrix.

3.6. Electrochemical characterization through the EIS technique
The nature and the electron population density of the films were evaluated from the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots derived from the capacitance–voltage measurements and based on eqn (6).28Fig. 11 shows the typical M–S plots for the cell ITO glass/BiCdTe/Sx2−–S2−/Pt system at a frequency of 1 kHz. CSC−2 = (V − Vfb − kBTe−1) 2(ε0εSNDe)−1(6)where V and Vfb are, respectively, the electrode potential and flat band potential, ε0 and εS are the permittivities in a vacuum and in a SC compound, respectively, e is the electronic charge, T is the operating temperature (298 K), kB is the Boltzmann's constant and CSC is the space charge capacitance of the films. The positive slope of M–S plots account for n-type conductivity of the SC films and the nonlinearity in the plots are due to the different behavioral properties of the SC matrix. The dielectric constant (εS) value of the films obtained from dielectric loss measurements at 1 kHz frequency was used to determine the ND values, summarized in Table 3.

The n-type films were then subjected to polarization and the highest negative value of Vfb is obtained for the film developed under 500 cycles which is indicative of less activation potential for the redox process occurring at the SC–electrolyte interface. The carrier density (Fig. 11 inset) attains the maximum value within 500–750 cycles (ND = 3.25 × 1017 cm3 for 500 cycles) even better than those obtained for the pure CdTe (0.55 × 1017 cm3) developed under 500 cycles.11
The EIS records also derive the frequency dispersion impedance spectra as demonstrated in the Nyquist plots (Fig. 12) and the phase shifts as a function of frequency, in the Bode modulus plot (Fig. 13). The impedance data were analyzed based upon the Randles equivalent circuit (EC) model (inset Fig. 12). The EIS parameters including solution resistance (Rs), charge transfer impedance (Rct) and constant phase element (CPE) representing the double layer capacitance at the interfacial region are summarized in Table 3. The gradual enrichment of Bi in the film with increasing periodic cycles not only increases absorption capability but also imparts certain metallic character to the film matrix, resulting in faster reaction kinetics. There is a fair possibility of intermediate band formation into the semiconductor energy state by the inclusion of Bi/its compounds, which in effect may reduce the band bending.29 The film deposited at 500 periodic cycles appears to be optimized, exhibiting significantly lower Rct value (492 ohm) in contrast with the other films obtained with less or greater number of voltammetric scans and even when compared to pure CdTe. This particular film also bears a moderate capacitance value, as desired, since much higher capacitance value may introduce recombination between the charge carriers.

 Fig. 13  Bode plot-variation of (i) log|Z| and (ii) phase shift with logf. 
In the Bode plots (Fig. 13) the maximum phase shift θmax for the BiCdTe composite films is found to be frequency dependent and follow the order 100 > 250 ≈ 500 > 750 < 1000 of periodic cycles. Since the capacitor's impedance is inversely proportional to the frequency, it may be predicted that the impedance value increases in the reverse order, which in turn reflects the apparent departure from capacitive behavior towards approximately resistive behavior of the circuit following the order 100 < 250 ≈ 500 < 750 > 1000. The same is also effectively manifested in the negative shift of the θmax in the similar order. For the lower cycles resulting in less Bi in the matrix, the maxima appear in the high frequency region while with higher Bi content, the maxima shifts to the low frequency region. The lowering of θmax as well as its negative shift with low frequency values relates to the circuit contribution towards approaching resistive behavior for the films developed in the range of 250–500 cycles.
3.7. Transient photo-response, potentiostatic polarization and I–V measurements
The photosensitivity of BiCdTe films is distinctly visible in the photo-current display of the PEC system (Fig. 14a). The short circuit current output is considerably raised for the BiCdTe developed at 500 cycles as compared to other films. The chrono-amperometric study (Iscvs. t plots) of the films (Fig. 14b) under illuminated and dark conditions demonstrates that the photo-degradation can be controlled at 500 cycles and a considerable amount of photo-current can be derived using the optimized BiCdTe composite matrix. Potentiostatic polarization curves for the synthesized films (Fig. 15a and b) clearly indicate consistent enhancement of photocurrent at the respective potentials compared to that in the dark.

 Fig. 15  Potentiostatic polarization plots under (a) dark and (b) illuminated conditions. 
The performance output of the PEC cells using the synthesized films was recorded from the I–V and power density plots (Fig. 16) under illumination at 50 mW cm−2. The corresponding open circuit potentials (Voc) and short circuit currents (Isc), power conversion efficiencies (% η) and fill factors (FF) derived thereof are summarized in Table 3. It is observed that most of the films are sustained with a photo-conversion efficiency on an average of 2.5%. Among these a maximum efficiency of 4.30% and an appreciable fill factor of 37.74% were displayed by the film obtained with 500 periodic scans. The fall of efficiency, beyond 500 cycles is attributed to the presence of excess higher energy metal oxide on the film matrices, thereby inducing stoichiometric defects. Overall, a clear trade off is observed between the conversion efficiency, reaching a promising level with optimum Bi inclusion in the CdTe matrix at 500 cycles and the photo-degradability with a reduced Cd level.

4. Conclusion
Periodic voltammetry has been very useful for developing composite n-BiCdTe films with reasonable photo-electrochemical properties. It is possible to maneuver the growth of the composite film with desired formulation under the influence of repeated voltammetric cycles. In general the composite BiCdTe films developed in the present investigation bear improved PEC character, although their stability towards photo-corrosion is compromised when compared to those reported for CdTe in our earlier study.11 However the contributions of Rct and CPE values are complementary to each other for most of the films and particularly Rct is reasonably reduced in case of the film developed at 500 cycles. The films developed under the regime of 250–500 voltammetric cycles are characterized with excellent PEC performance and appreciable stability factor acquired through stoichiometric compound formation and as detected by their suppressed corrosion rates. Among these, the periodic scan of 500 cycles is regarded as the most effective condition for depositing the best BiCdTe film produced in this study, exhibiting a photo-conversion efficiency of 4.3%.
