        TiO2
nanoparticles with anatase/rutile mixed phase and <100 nm in size were surface-modified using hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and sulfosuccinic acid (SA), which can coordinate to the TiO2 precursor, titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP). The HEMA in TiO2-HEMA nanoparticles underwent a graft/crosslink polymerization to poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA), i.e.TiO2-PHEMA. Following the application of a sol–gel process with TTIP, 3-dimensional (3D) nanostructured TiO2 photoelectrodes with interconnectivity, large surface area and bimodal pores were successfully obtained. The energy conversion efficiency of a polymer electrolyte dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) fabricated with TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP photoelectrode reached 3.5% at 100 mW cm−2, which was much higher than those of pristine TiO2 (1.4%), TiO2/TTIP (1.6%) and TiO2-HEMA/TTIP (2.0%) photoelectrodes. The higher cell performance of TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP is due to enhanced light harvesting, reduced charge recombination and excellent penetration of polymer electrolytes into the TiO2 pores.
Introduction

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention as a promising photovoltaic technology alternative to conventional Si-based semiconductor solar cells due to their cost-effectiveness, ease of manufacturing and suitability for large area production.1,2 In general, DSSCs employ liquid electrolytes containing I−/I3−redox couples and have obtained an energy conversion efficiency of approximately 10%. Since the pioneering discovery of DSSCs by Gratzel's group in 1991,1 research has focused on increasing device performance, which can be achieved by improving performance in the dye,3,4 the nanocrystalline TiO2 layer,5,6 the thermal-resistance transparent conducting oxide (TCO),7 the electrolyte8,9 or the electrode-electrolyte interface.10 In particular, the TiO2 photoelectrode is of primary importance because it can directly change light harvesting, charge recombination and interfacial contact of the electrode/electrolyte, which in turn influences photovoltaic cell performance. However, further increase of DSSC performance remains a technological challenge.

        Light harvesting in DSSCs can be enhanced in two different ways. One is to increase specific surface area, providing large adsorption sites for the dye molecules. The other is to utilize optical enhancement effects, which can be achieved by means of the light scattering of large particles. In this regard, TiO2 photoelectrodes with an anatase/rutile mixture phase would be more effective in achieving light harvesting than the corresponding pure phase TiO2. Anatase phase TiO2 provides large specific surface area, which maximizes the amount of dye adsorption, whereas rutile phase TiO2 possesses excellent light scattering characteristics due to its high refractive index.11,12
The electron transport in the conduction band of the photoelectrode and the interfacial recombination of charge carriers at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interfaces are the main bottlenecks in DSSCs. Many efforts have been made to control electrode structure in order to improve electron transport and retard electron recombination. However, electron transport through a random particulate TiO2 photoelectrode is inefficient due to a lack of long range arrangement and formation of an irregular framework.13 Alternatively, TiO2 photoelectrodes with 3-dimensional (3D) interconnected structures would serve as a pathway to improve electron transport and retard electron recombination.
There is strong interest in developing solid-state DSSCs (ssDSSCs) due to the potential to decrease the overall weight of cells and to provide long-term durability and flexibility. Many efforts have been made to substitute the liquid electrolyte with gel or polymer electrolytes14–19 or hole transport materials (HTMs).20–24 In ssDSSCs, the electrode/electrolyte interfacial contact as well as the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte is the most important factor in determining cell performance.25–27 This is because the size of the polymer coil is too large to infiltrate into the nanopores of TiO2 photoelectrodes, leading to a large electrode/electrolyte interfacial resistance. One possible solution is to use the “oligomer approaches,” by which small oligomer electrolytes readily penetrate into the TiO2 nanopores, followed by in situ solidification to improve the mechanical stability of the electrolyte.27 Alternatively, the design of TiO2 photoelectrodes with high porosity and suitable pore sizes would be effective in ssDSSC.28
A desire for enhanced light harvesting, minimized charge recombination and improved interfacial contact of electrode/electrolyte triggered our interest in exploring mesoporous TiO2 photoelectrodes with large specific surface area, 3D interconnectivity, bimodal pores and an anatase/rutile mixture phase. The TiO2 photoelectrode was prepared by the combined process of graft/crosslink polymerization and a sol–gel reaction. Mesoporous TiO2 films were characterized using Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis (BET) and the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. DSSCs employing polymer electrolyte were fabricated and characterized in detail via current–voltage curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).
Experimental
Materials

          Titanium dioxide (TiO2, <100 nm, mixture of rutile and anatase), hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), sulfosuccinic acid (SA), 4,4′-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) (ACVA), titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP, 97%), hydrogen chloride (HCl, 35 wt%), fumed silica nanoparticles (SiO2, 14 nm), poly(ethylene glycol dimethyl ether) (PEGDME, Mn = 500 g mol−1), iodine (I2), titanium(IV) bis(ethyl acetoacetato) diisopropoxide, chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6) and sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH, 0.1 N) were purchased from Aldrich. Distilled water was obtained with a water purification system made by Millipore Corporation. 1-Methyl-3-propyl imidazolium iodide (MPII) and ruthenium dye (535-bisTBA, N719) were purchased from Solaronix, Switzerland. Acetonitrile (99.9%), butanol (99.9%), isopropanol (99.9%), chloroform (99.9%), ethanol (99.9%), tetrahydrofuran (THF, 99.9%) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%) were purchased from J.T. Baker. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass substrate (TEC8, 8 ohms/sq, 2.3 mm thick) was purchased from Pilkington, France. All solvents and chemicals were reagent grade and used as received without further purification.
Surface modification of TiO2 nanoparticles
First, 1 g of TiO2 with a rutile/anatase phase mixture was dispersed in 20 mL of DMSO with stirring and then 1 mL of HEMA was added to the solution. Then, 20 wt% of SA with respect to the total solution was added into the solution and stirred in a 120 °C oil bath for 3h. Then, the solution was poured into THF to remove the unreacted SA and HEMA. After filtering and washing several times, the surface modified TiO2-HEMA was obtained and dried in a vacuum oven overnight at room temperature. The grafting amount of HEMA from TiO2 was approximately 30 wt%, as determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).
Second, 1 g of TiO2-HEMA was dispersed in 20 ml of DMSO with stirring. Then 5 wt% of ACVA with respect to the total solution was added and stirred in a 80 °C oil bath for 48 h under a N2 atmosphere. After the graft/crosslink reaction of HEMA to poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA), the solution was poured into THF to remove the ungrafted PHEMA. After filtering and washing several times, TiO2-PHEMA was obtained and dried in a vacuum oven overnight at room temperature. The procedures for surface modification of TiO2 and graft/crosslink polymerization of PHEMA are presented in Scheme 1.

Preparation of mesoporous TiO2 photoelectrodes
First, 0.039 g of pristine TiO2 (or TiO2-HEMA or TiO2-PHEMA) powder was dispersed in 1.08 ml of isopropanol and sonicated for 1h for better dispersion. Separately, 0.18 ml of TTIP was dissolved and stabilized in the mixture solution of 0.2 ml HCl and 0.04 ml DI water with vigorous stirring. After aging for 15 min, the TTIP solution was added to the pristine TiO2 (or TiO2-HEMA or TiO2-PHEMA) solution. The sols were aged under mild stirring at room temperature for 3 h. These sols were deposited onto the FTO glass using a doctor blade and were aged at room temperature and 80% relative humidity (RH) for 30 h. The FTO glasses were successively sintered at 450 °C for 30 min and cooled to 30 °C over 8 h. Nanocrystalline TiO2 photoelectrodes were sensitized with the ruthenium solution 10−4 M in ethanol 50 °C for 2 h in a dark room. The dye-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes were rinsed with absolute ethanol and dried in a vacuum oven. The schematic representation for synthesizing mesoporous TiO2 photoelectrodes with different structures is shown in Scheme 2.

Preparation of counterelectrodes
Transparent glasses coated with conductive FTO were used for counter electrodes. These glasses were cleaned by sonication in isopropanol and then in chloroform. The counter electrodes were prepared by spin coating 4 wt% H2PtCl6 isopropanol solution onto the conductive FTO glass followed by sintering at 450 °C for 30 min and cooling to 30 °C over 8 h.
Fabrication of DSSCs
DSSCs with an active area of 0.40 cm2 were constructed by drop-casting polymer electrolyte solution onto the photoelectrode and covering with the counter electrode, according to the previously reported procedure.29–31 A polymer electrolyte solution was prepared by dissolving PEGDME, SiO2, MPII and I2 in acetonitrile. The mole ratio of ether oxygen to iodide salt was fixed at 20, and the iodine content was fixed at 10 wt% with respect to the salt.32 The cells were placed in a vacuum oven for a day to permit complete evaporation of the solvent and were then sealed with an epoxy resin.
Photoelectrochemical performances were measured using a Keithley Model 2400 and a 1000 W xenon lamp (Oriel, 91193). The light intensity was homogeneous over an 8 × 8 in2 area, and its intensity was calibrated with a Si solar cell (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy System, Mono-Si + KG filter, Certificate No. C-ISE269) for a sunlight intensity of one (100 mW cm−2). This calibration was double-checked with a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell (PV Measurements Inc.). The photoelectrochemical performances were calculated by the following equations. (1) (2)where Jsc is a short-circuit current density (mA cm−2), Voc is an open-circuit voltage (V), Pin is an incident light power, FF is the fill factor, η is an overall energy conversion efficiency and Jmax (mA cm−2) and Vmax (V) are the current density and voltage in the J–V curve, respectively, at the point of maximum power output.

Dye loading measurement of TiO2 photoelectrodes
In order to measure the amounts of dye adsorbed onto the TiO2 photoelectrode, the N719 dye sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode was dipped into 10 mL of a 10−2 M solution of NaOH in an ethanol-H2O mixture (1:1). This mixture was stirred until complete desorption of the N719 dye into the liquid took place. The volume of NaOH solution containing the fully desorbed dye was carefully measured by UV-visible spectroscopy (Hewlett–Packard, Hayward, CA, USA). The absorption value at 515 nm was used to calculate the number of adsorbed N719 dye molecules, according to the Beer–Lambert law, A = εlc(3)where A is the absorbance of UV-visible spectra at a 515 nm wavelength, the molar extinction coefficient of the dye at 515 nm is ε = 14100 M−1 cm−1, l is the path length of the light beam and c is the concentration of the dye.33
Characterization

FT-IR spectra of the samples were collected using an Excalibur Series FT-IR (DIGLAB Co.) instrument, at frequencies ranging from 4000 cm−1 to 600 cm−1 using an ATR facility; 64 scans were signal-averaged at a resolution of 4 cm−1. XRD was performed on a Rigaku 18kW rotating anode X-ray generator, with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), operated at 40 kV and 300 mA. The 2θ range was from 5° to 60° with a scanning speed of 3° min−1, and the distance from the sample to the detector was 185 mm. Electrode structure was characterized by FE-SEM (SUPRA 55VP, NICEM, Carl Zeiss). The specific surface area, average pore diameter, specific pore volume, and average particle diameter of the TiO2 films were measured using the N2 adsorption-desorption isothermvia the BET (for specific surface area) and BJH (for specific pore volume and average pore diameter) methods. In advance of these measurements, the TiO2 films were additionally degassed at 70 °C under dynamic vacuum (10−2 Torr) for 1 h. The EIS data were measured with a compactstat electrochemistry analyzer (IVIUM Technologies), with a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 0.1 MHz and a potential modulation of 0.2 V under AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) light illumination.
Results and discussion

FT-IR spectra of different TiO2 films were measured to characterize the structural change of TiO2, as shown in Fig. 1. A broad band was observed at approximately 700 cm−1 for the pristine TiO2 with a rutile/anatase mixture phase, which is ascribed to the stretching vibration of Ti–O–Ti groups.34 The pristine TiO2 also exhibited absorption bands at 3300 and 1640 cm−1, corresponding to H–O–H stretching and –OH bending vibration, respectively, indicating the presence of hydroxyl groups on the TiO2 surface.35 Upon surface modification of TiO2 (Fig. 1b), the hydroxyl stretching band at 3300 cm−1 shifted to a higher wavenumber at 3398 cm−1 with an increased intensity. In addition, several strong bands at 1720, 1658 and 1157 cm−l were observed, which are assigned to the stretching vibrations of CO, CC and C–O groups of HEMA, respectively. A sharp peak at 1016 cm−l additionally appeared due to the stretching vibration of the sulfonic acid groups of SA. These FT-IR spectra are clear evidence of the surface modification of TiO2 with HEMA and SAvia esterification, as illustrated in Scheme 1. The FT-IR spectrum of TiO2-PHEMA (Fig. 1c) was not significantly different from that of TiO2-HEMA. However, the stretching band at 1658 cm−1 completely disappeared, suggesting successful graft polymerization of HEMA to PHEMA by thermal initiator ACVA.

Coordinative interactions between the surface modified TiO2 and the precursor TTIP were also investigated using FT-IR spectroscopy. Upon combining the pristine TiO2 with TTIP, the stretching vibration of –OH groups largely shifted from 3300 to 3150 cm−1, demonstrating that –OH groups are actively involved in hydrogen bonding interactions (Fig. 1a). Upon the introduction of TTIP to TiO2-HEMA (Fig. 1b), the –OH stretching band at 3398 cm−1 was changed to 3131 cm−1 and the bands of the carbonyl (CO) group at 1720 cm−1 and the sulfonic acid (SO3−) group at 1016 cm−1 shifted to 1702 and 1005 cm−1, respectively. These peak shifts to lower wavenumbers result from the loosened interactions of hydroxyl (–OH), carbonyl (CO) and sulfonic acid (SO3−) groups due to coordinative interactions between surface modified TiO2 nanoparticles and the precursor TTIP. Similar interactions were observed for TiO2-PHEMA systems, as seen in Fig. 1c. After calcination at 450 °C, the stretching band of the –OH group was again shifted to a higher wavenumber at 3340 cm−1 for all three systems, indicating a change in interaction strength of hydrogen bonding.

XRD has been established as an effective tool for crystal phase identification and estimation of the crystallite size of each phase. Thus, the XRD patterns of various TiO2 samples were measured and are presented in Fig. 2. The average size of crystallites was calculated using the Scherrer equation.36 (4)where D is the average size of TiO2 nanoparticle crystallites, k is a shape factor of the particle (0.89), λ is the wavelength of X-ray (λ = 1.5406 Å), β is the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak, and θ is half of Bragg's diffraction angle of the centroid of the peak in degrees. In general, XRD peaks of crystalline inorganic particles are sharp with strong intensities, whereas those of amorphous polymers are broad. Pristine TiO2 exhibited several sharp peaks at 2θ values of 27.5°, 36.2°, 41.4° and 54.5°, corresponding to (110), (101), (111) and (211) crystal planes of the rutile TiO2 phase, respectively (ICDD-JCPDS database, no. 77-0441).37 Applying the Scherrer equation to the rutile (110) diffraction peak, the average crystallite size of the pristine TiO2 was determined to be approximately 100 nm. Upon surface modification of TiO2 with HEMA, a broad amorphous band with a 2θ value of 17° was additionally observed, indicating successful esterification between the –OH group of TiO2, the –OH group of HEMA and the –COOH group of SA. However, the surface modification did not have a significant effect on the crystallinity of TiO2. Upon graft/crosslink reaction to PHEMA, the broad amorphous band at 17° grew further without change in position due to the increased amounts of organic polymeric chains relative to crystal TiO2 particles. After combining with TTIP and sol–gel reaction, new peaks additionally appeared at 2θ values of 25.5°, 38.0° and 48.2°, which correspond to the (101), (004) and (200) of anatase TiO2, respectively (ICDD-JCPDS no. 86-1157).38 According to the Scherrer equation, the crystallite sizes of TiO2/TTIP, TiO2-HEMA/TTIP and TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP were determined to be 10, 10 and 9 nm, respectively, which were much smaller than that of the pristine TiO2 (100 nm).

It is generally recognized that anatase TiO2 is preferred because of its larger surface area and higher conduction band edge energy. However, rutile TiO2 is the most stable form and has superior light scattering properties, and is therefore beneficial for effective light harvesting. Thus, the composition ratio of the TiO2 crystal phase will directly affect the performance of DSSCs, and this mixed phase TiO2 should deliver higher performance than either pure anatase or pure rutile phases.39 The ratio of TiO2 crystal phase was calculated according to eqn (5), (5)where WR, AA, and AR represent the weight percentage of the rutile phase, the integrated intensity of anatase (101) peak, and the integrated intensity of rutile (110) peak, respectively.40 It was found that the TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP has a ratio of anatase:rutile = 75:25 wt%, which is comparable to commercially available P25 nanoparticles (85:15 wt%). Thus, it is expected that the TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP photoelectrode will provide a synergistic effect on cell performance with the optimized ratio of anatase/rutile mixture phase.
In order to achieve high performance DSSCs, the following factors must be considered, i.e. large specific surface area, good connectivity between TiO2 nanoparticles and sufficient electrolyte penetration into the electrode pores. Thus, the morphological changes in TiO2 photoelectrodes were characterized using FE-SEM, as shown in Fig. 3. Large, rectangular parallelepiped nanoparticles with low specific surface area, few interconnections and low specific pore volume were observed in the pristine TiO2 (Fig. 3a). Upon combining TiO2 with TTIPvia sol–gel reaction, the morphology of the photoelectrode significantly changed to randomly aggregated TiO2 clusters with reduced size (Fig. 3b). This is presumably because large pristine TiO2 particles covered with small TiO2 directly formed via sol–gel reactions of TTIP. Thus, the TiO2/TTIP photoelectrode provides larger specific surface area than the pristine TiO2. Upon surface modification of TiO2 with HEMA (Fig. 3c), a smooth homogeneous surface was observed covering the TiO2 nanoparticles because the inorganic TiO2 and organic HEMA were tightly interconnected by crosslinked SA, as supported by the previous FT-IR and WAXS analysis data. The TiO2-HEMA/TTIP film contains large nanoparticles, 100 nm in size, surrounded by small TiO2 nanoparticles 10 nm in size (Fig. 3d). However, this large specific surface area might also lead to the greater possibility of charge recombination between the photoelectrode and the electrolyte, which can limit the Voc value. Upon polymerization of HEMA to PHEMA (Fig. 3e), the morphology was similar to TiO2-HEMA, but the surface was flatter and smoother due to higher content of organic PHEMA chains. After combining with TTIP and calcination at 450 °C (Fig. 3f), the TiO2 photoelectrode with large specific surface area and high specific pore volume was obtained. A magnified image clearly showed the formation of TiO2 nanoparticles with good interconnectivity, hierarchical structure and bimodal pores (Fig. 3e). This structure originates from the coordinative interactions between the precursor TTIP and the surface modified TiO2-PHEMA nanoparticles. The cross-sectional morphology (Fig. 3h) of the TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP photoelectrode was not significantly different from that of the surface morphology, indicating its 3-dimensionally interconnected structure. The thickness of the TiO2 photoelectrode was approximately 10 μm, as shown in Fig. 3i. This morphology might be readily applicable to ssDSSCs, in which the infiltration of polymer chains is important.

To obtain insight into textural properties of TiO2 photoelectrodes, BET measurements were performed, and the resulting N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms for various TiO2 photoelectrodes are shown in Figure 1S (in electronic supplementary information, ESI†). Specific surface area, specific pore volume and average pore diameter were calculated by the BET and BJH methods, and the results are summarized in Table 1. The amount of dye adsorption in various TiO2 photoelectrodes is also compared in Table 1. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of all the photoelectrodes exhibited typical Type IV behavior according to IUPAC nomenclature with hysteresis loops, which is ascribed to the existence of mesoporous structure. For the pristine TiO2 photoelectrode, there was a slight increase in adsorbed volume at relative pressures below P/P0 = 0.6, which is attributable to N2 monolayer adsorption. However, there was a drastic increase in N2 isotherms, and a hysteresis loop appeared at 0.6 < P/P0 < 0.85, because capillary condensation occurred inside the large mesopores but evaporation did not take place at the same pressure. Thus, it follows that the pristine TiO2 photoelectrode mainly contains mesopores and has a low specific surface area (10.6 m2 g−1). In the case of TiO2/TTIP and TiO2-HEMA/TTIP photoelectrodes, however, the hysteresis loops shifted to regions of lower relative pressure and their adsorbed volume at higher relative pressures increased. This suggests that the average pore diameter decreased and the specific surface areas increased compared to the pristine TiO2 photoelectrode. Further, the monolayer adsorption was not complete until reaching a relative pressure of 0.55, where the hysteresis loop opens, indicating the existence of mesopore structure with smaller sizes than that of the pristine TiO2. The specific surface areas of TiO2/TTIP and TiO2-HEMA/TTIP photoelectrodes were determined to be 15.1 and 18.9 m2 g−1, respectively, which were approximately 1.4 and 1.8 times, respectively, higher than that of the pristine TiO2 (10.6 m2 g−1). This implies that the performance of DSSCs fabricated with the TiO2/TTIP and TiO2-HEMA/TTIP photoelectrodes is superior to that with the pristine TiO2 due to the larger quantity of dye adsorption in the former cases. However, the total specific pore volumes of the TiO2/TTIP and TiO2-HEMA/TTIP photoelectrodes were lower than that of the pristine TiO2. These changes are accompanied by progressive elimination of the larger mesopores and gradual widening of the small mesopores. Lower specific pore volume has detrimental effects on the rapid diffusion of redox I−/I3− ions in the electrolyte, leading to reduced cell performance.

The TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP photoelectrode also exhibited a Type IV N2 isotherm where the hysteresis loop approached relatively higher pressures, indicating multilayer adsorption followed by capillary condensation. In particular, a tailing upward at higher hysteresis loop relative pressure (i.e. P/P0 = 1) indicates the formation of macroporosity, with contribution of large pores beyond mesopore scale,41 which can clearly be seen in the pore size distributions of Fig. 4. Interestingly, both the specific surface area (27.1 m2 g−1) and specific pore volume (0.350 cm3 g−1) of TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP photoelectrodes were much larger than those of the other photoelectrodes. The results obtained by BET analysis are consistent with the formerly described XRD and FE-SEM analysis. In addition, the dye adsorption value shown in Table 1 is in good agreement with the specific surface area results.
 Fig. 4  
          Pore size distributions of pristine TiO2, TiO2/TTIP, TiO2-HEMA/TTIP and TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP obtained from desorption by the BJH method. 
Assuming cylindrical pores in TiO2 photoelectrodes,42,43 the BJH model was used to determine the pore size distributions and the results are shown in Fig. 4. The average pore diameters were determined to be 39.2, 22.3 and 26.7 nm, respectively, for pristine TiO2, TiO2/TTIP and TiO2-HEMA/TTIP photoelectrodes. These results suggest that sol–gel reactions using TTIP produce smaller mesoporous structures of TiO2. Interestingly, there were bimodal pores in the TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP photoelectrode, i.e. mesopores 30.7 nm in diameter and macropores 257.1 nm in diameter. This dual porosity structure in the TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP photoelectrode was also confirmed by FE-SEM (Fig. 3). Smaller mesopores likely result from the sol–gel reaction of TTIP with TiO2, while the larger macropores are from polymerized PHEMA that can produce pores after calcination at 450 °C. TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP photoelectrodes with high specific pore volume, larger specific pore volume and dual porosity would be effective for ssDSSC employing large polymer electrolytes.

EIS measurements were performed for TiO2 photoelectrodes to understand the mechanism of interfacial charge transfer resistance and recombination processes at the interfaces, which directly influence cell performance. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the Nyquist and Bode phase plots, respectively, of the various DSSCs at 100 mW cm−2 for a frequency range between 0.01 Hz to 0.1 MHz. According to the diffusion recombination model, the equivalent circuit is illustrated in Fig. 5(c), wherein resistance elements can be explained by various cell parameters. Rs is the series resistance including the sheet resistance of the FTO glass, R1 is the charge transfer resistance to the Pt counter electrode, R2 is the charge transfer resistance of TiO2 photoelectrode/dye/electrolyte interface, and Ws is ionic diffusion within the electrolyte. CPE1 and CPE2 are constant phase elements of capacitance corresponding to R1 and R2, respectively. The electro-kinetic properties, i.e. the resistance values (Rs, R1, R2 and Ws), minimum angular frequency (ωmin) and lifetime of electrons for recombination (τr) for each DSSC are summarized in Table 2. Upon analysis of Nyquist impedance data through fitting with the equivalent circuit, the total resistances for DSSCs with the pristine TiO2, TiO2/TTIP, TiO2-HEMA/TTIP and TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP photoelectrodes were 199, 216, 205 and 164 Ω, respectively. Because we used the same FTO substrate, counterelectrode and polymer electrolyte, the differences in Rs, R1 and Ws values is negligible. Thus, the difference in total resistance among the four systems mostly results from the modification of the TiO2 photoelectrode, which is related to the R2 value at the TiO2 photoelectrode/dye/electrolyte interface. The charge transfer resistances of TiO2/TTIP (R2 = 113 Ω) and TiO2-HEMA/TTIP (101 Ω) were larger than that of pristine TiO2 (90 Ω). This is presumably because easier penetration of polymer electrolyte is not allowed in the TiO2/TTIP and TiO2-HEMA/TTIP photoelectrodes due to smaller pore sizes than the pristine TiO2, as confirmed by BET analysis and will be supported by the lower FF values in DSSC performance, discussed below. However, the R2 value of TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP photoelectrode was 62 Ω, which is much smaller than those of the other photoelectrodes. This might result from a TiO2 structure with a high porosity and bimodal pores, which allows for facile and sufficient infiltration of large polymer electrolyte into the TiO2 pores.

Although many factors affect cell performance, charge recombination is one of the most important. In general, the recombination of electrons and holes occurs at the interface between the TiO2 photoelectrode and the redox ions in the electrolyte. Lifetime of electrons for recombination (τr) can be directly determined from the minimum angular frequency (ωmin) value in the Bode plots according to eqn (6): (6)where ωmin is the impedance semicircle at a middle frequency in the Bode spectra. The characteristic frequency peak at a middle frequency corresponds to the accumulation/transport of the injected electrons within the TiO2 photoelectrode and charge recombination at the interface of the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte. The ωmin values of TiO2/TTIP (130 Hz) and TiO2-HEMA/TTIP (152 Hz) shifted to a higher frequency compared to the pristine TiO2 (114 Hz), which indicates that the τr values of the former (7.7 and 6.6 ms, respectively) are shorter than that of the latter (8.8 ms). This result is attributed to the larger specific surface area of TiO2/TTIP and TiO2-HEMA/TTIP photoelectrodes, resulting in higher concentrations of effective electron acceptors, which allow for greater possibility of charge recombination between the electrolyte and the TiO2 photoelectrode. The ωmin value of TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP was the lowest (84 Hz), indicating the longest τr value (11.9 ms). Such an enhancement in electron transport for the TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP photoelectrode originated from the good interparticle connectivity of the photoelectrode and the formation of an additional anatase TiO2 phase, as confirmed by SEM and XRD analysis. These structures can shorten electron transport time in the photoelectrode and suppress the recombination of electrons with the redox electrolyte.

Fig. 6 shows the J–V curves of N719 sensitized DSSCs fabricated with four different photoelectrodes and a PEGDME/SiO2/MPII/I2polymer electrolyte at 100 mW cm−2. Their photovoltaic parameters, including Voc, Jsc, FF and η are summarized in Table 3. The DSSC fabricated with the pristine TiO2 photoelectrode showed an energy conversion efficiency as low as 1.4%, mostly due to a lower Jsc value. However, the DSSCs with TiO2/TTIP and TiO2-HEMA/TTIP photoelectrodes resulted in considerable improvement in Jsc values, leading to an increase in cell efficiency. The increase in Jsc arose from the increased photoelectrode surface area due to the formation of anatase TiO2 nanoparticlesvia a sol–gel process, which results in a larger amount of dye adsorption. However, the values of Voc and FF were slightly decreased compared to the pristine TiO2 photoelectrode due to a faster electron recombination rate and increased interfacial resistance (R2) value, as revealed by EIS analysis. The highest efficiency (3.5%) and increased Voc and Jsc values were obtained for the DSSC with TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP photoelectrode. The drastic improvement in Jsc comes from the increased surface area of the photoelectrode by the formation of a secondary small TiO2 anatase phase, which leads to increased dye adsorption values. In addition, the basic framework of the rutile TiO2 phase functioned as a light scattering matter to enhance light harvesting efficiency. Interestingly, the Voc value also increased up to 0.75 V using the TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP photoelectrode, which resulted from the reduction of electron recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. In general, the increase in dye absorption amounts leads to an increase in charge recombination between the injected electrons and the tri-iodides, which often limits Voc. However, the formation of the anatase phase and 3D interconnected structure in TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP compensated for this negative effect due to its abundant surface area, minimizing interfacial charge recombination loss. In addition, the formation of macropores, 300 nm in size, allowed for sufficient penetration of polymer electrolyte into the photoelectrode, which decreased the interfacial resistance (R2) value, having a positive effect on FF. It is therefore concluded that a considerable efficiency enhancement in the DSSC fabricated with a TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP photoelectrode is due to the synergistic effect of large dye absorption amount, greater light scattering, enhanced electron transfer and better penetration of polymer electrolytes.

Conclusions
The combined process of graft/crosslink polymerization and sol–gel reaction has been introduced into TiO2 nanoparticles <100nm in size with an anatase/rutile mixed phase, as confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy, SEM and XRD analysis. In particular, four different TiO2 photoelectrodes (i.e. pristine TiO2, TiO2/TTIP, TiO2-HEMA/TTIP and TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP) were prepared and their properties were compared systematically. The DSSC fabricated with the TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP photoelectrode and PEGDME/SiO2/MPII/I2polymer electrolyte exhibited an energy conversion efficiency of 3.5% at 100 mW cm−2 as a result of simultaneous increases in Jsc, Voc and FF values. This value was much higher than those with the pristine TiO2 (1.4%), TiO2/TTIP (1.6%) or TiO2-HEMA/TTIP (2.0%) photoelectrodes. The high performance of the TiO2-PHEMA/TTIP photoelectrode resulted from its large specific surface area, bimodal pore distribution, 3D interconnectivity and anatase/rutile mixed phase, as confirmed by SEM and XRD analysis. This novel structure provides an effective way to approach high performance DSSCs with enhanced light harvesting and to minimize charge recombination with excellent penetration of the polymer electrolyte. Replacing the polymer electrolyte with liquid electrolyte or using small anatase TiO2 nanoparticles as a starting material is expected to improve the cell efficiency, which is currently investigated in our lab.
