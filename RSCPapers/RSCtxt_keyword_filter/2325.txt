    , Accepted 16th August 2018First published on 20th August 2018AbstractTremendous efforts have been devoted for designing polymer acceptors to replace fullerene derivatives for high-performance all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). For this purpose, based on the famous copolymer acceptor PNDIT2, a series of random terpolymers are synthesized by replacing the naphthalene diimide unit with a very small amount of phosphorescent Pt complex, (dbm)PtPyTPA, which is linked through the dibenzoylmethane (dbm) ancillary ligand to the PNDIT2 backbone. The terpolymers P(dbm)PtPyTPAx, where x represents the feed ratio (1, 2 and 5 mol%) of Pt complex, exhibit comparable optical and electrochemical properties to those of the PNDIT2 copolymer. Interestingly, by blending PNDIT2 or P(dbm)PtPyTPAx polymer acceptor with the PTB7-Th polymer donor, gradually enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) is achieved with an increase in the Pt complex feed ratio in both the conventional and inverted configurations of all-PSCs. The terpolymer acceptor P(dbm)PtPyTPA5 shows the highest PCE with maximum/average values of 3.97%/3.88% and 4.99%/4.91% compared to 2.58%/2.54% and 3.72%/3.66%, showing 53% and 34% increase in the conventional and inverted structures, respectively. Through a combination of photoelectric measurements, it is found that the improvement in PCE is mainly due to more efficient exciton separation, less charge recombination and higher hole and electron mobilities with enhanced short current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). An increase in the maximum PCE value from 3.79% for PNDIT2 to 6.18% for the Pt-containing terpolymer is also observed in all-PSCs based on another polymer donor, PBDB-T. The heavy-metal-containing random terpolymer acceptors in this study afford a facile approach to improve the photovoltaic performances of all-PSCs based on current high-efficiency copolymer acceptors.
Introduction
Owing to their advantages of low-cost, flexibility, light-weight and solution-processing, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been considered as a promising photovoltaic technology in the past few decades.1–4 Very recently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs based on polymer donors/non-fullerene small-molecule acceptors (NF-SMAs) has been found to approach 15%.5–11
Compared with polymer/fullerene and polymer/NF-SMA PSCs, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), which consist of a p-type conjugated polymer donor and an n-type conjugated polymer acceptor in the active layer, have demonstrated unique benefits such as enhanced optical, thermal, mechanical and morphological stabilities, and they are also preferable for large-area fabrication.12–16 Great efforts have been devoted to the design of new materials and optimization of device structures; together with the careful control of film morphology and polymer aggregation behavior, PCE of all-PSCs has been improved to 10%.17–22
It should be noted that PCE of all-PSCs still lags behind that of NF-SMA solar cells.23–25 From the materials point of view, several polymer donors have emerged, whereas polymer acceptors have been rarely reported.26 To date, effective polymer acceptors are mainly constructed via alternative combination of electron-donating (D) moieties, such as thiophene derivatives, and electron-accepting (A) building blocks such as naphthalene diimide (NDI),27–29 perylene diimide (PDI)30,31 and B ← N bridged units.32–35 Among them, poly[[N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)] (PNDIT2, also known as N2200) has been widely employed as a polymer acceptor in current high-efficiency all-PSCs because of its high electron mobility, high electron affinity and broad light absorption.36,37 For example, Li and co-workers demonstrated a high PCE value of 8.27% by blending a medium-bandgap benzodithiophene-alt-difluorobenzotriazole copolymer donor J51 with N2200.20 In addition, by successfully incorporating a heptamethyltrisiloxane-modified pyrrolo[3,4-f]benzotriazole-5,7-dione unit into the copolymer donor of PTzBI-Si, Huang et al. fabricated N2200-based all-PSCs with unprecedented PCEs greater than 10%.
Besides the development of new polymer donors that exhibit complementary absorption with N2200, the design and synthesis of NDI containing 2D/1A- or 2A/1D-type random terpolymers are also effective approaches to improve PCE of N2200-based all-PSCs.38–42 For example, Wang and co-workers designed a new random terpolymer acceptor PNDI-T10 by replacing 10 mol% bithiophene in N2200 with single thiophene; when blended with poly[4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)-2-thienyl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-(4-(2-ethylhexyl)-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-)-2-carboxylate-2-6-diyl] (PTB7-Th), a high PCE value of 7.6% was achieved, which was significantly superior to 3.7% of PTB7-Th:N2200-based all-PSCs.38 Afterwards, the PCE was further enhanced to 9.0% in ternary all-PSCs by blending the PNDI-T10 terpolymer acceptor with two polymer donors of PBDTTS-FTAZ and PTB7-Th.39 Additionally, Chen et al. synthesized 2D/1A random terpolymer acceptors based on two electron-rich thieno[3,2-b]-thiophene (TT) and thienylene-vinylene-thienylene (TVT) and one electron-deficient NDI unit, and these materials presented high PCE of 5.27% when blended with PTB7-Th, which was superior to 0.79% of the PNDI-TT copolymer and 2.94% of PNDI-TVT-based all-PSCs.40,41
In our previous study, for the first time, we reported heavy metal-containing random terpolymer acceptors by introducing an extremely low feed ratio (1 mol%) of Pt complex (dCzPtacac) into the polymer backbone of N2200 through the cyclometalated main-ligand.43 The all-PSCs constructed by PTB7-Th:PNDIT2Pt1 exhibited 16% increase in PCE compared to the control device of PTB7-Th:N2200. To further prove the reliability of the heavy-metal terpolymer approach to enhance the PCE of all-PSCs based on current high-efficiency copolymer acceptors, in this study, we introduced another Pt complex (dbm)PtPyTPA, which was random copolymerized to the PNDIT2 backbone through the dibenzoylmethane (dbm) auxiliary ligand instead of the main ligand. When combined with the polymer donor PTB7-Th, PCE gradually increased by increasing the feed ratio of the Pt complex from 1, 2 to 5 mol%. The best performance was achieved by using the P(dbm)PtPyTPA5 terpolymer acceptor, and the highest PCE values of 3.97% and 4.99% in the conventional and inverted device structures, respectively, were achieved, which were 53% and 34% higher than 2.58% and 3.72% of the control PNDIT2-based devices. Furthermore, an enhancement was also achieved in other all-PSCs based on the poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)](PBDB-T) donor material, and the maximum/average PCE increased from 3.79%/3.62% for the control PNDIT2 to 6.18%/6.01% for the terpolymer P(dbm)PtPyTPA1.
Result and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route for PNDIT2 and the random terpolymers P(dbm)PtPyTPAx is shown in Scheme 1. The starting materials N,N′-bis(2-octyl-1-dodecyl)-2,6-dibromonaphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic acid bisimide (NDI) and 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (T2) were purchased from Sunatech, and the Pt complex (dbm)PtPyTPA was synthesized according to previously reported procedures.44 The detailed polymerization process can be found in the ESI.† All the Pt-containing terpolymers were polymerized through the Stille coupling reaction. The Pt-based terpolymers were named P(dbm)PtPyTPAx, where x stands for the polymerization feed ratio of Pt complex (x = 1, 2 or 5 mol%). Unlike conjugation through the cyclometalated main ligands in our previous study, herein, (dbm)PtPyTPA was embedded into the polymer backbone through the two phenyl rings in the dibenzoylmethane ancillary ligand. It should be noted that the real Pt complex content in the polymer backbone was probably lower than the feed ratio; however, Pt could be detected through energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. S1–S3, ESI†). The platinum weight ratios of the Pt-containing polymer acceptors P(dbm)PtPyTPAx (x = 1, 2 and 5 mol%) were measured to be 0.16, 0.34, and 0.64 wt%, which were slightly lower than the theoretical values of 0.20, 0.39 and 0.98 wt%, respectively (Table S1, ESI†). For a more reliable comparison, we also synthesized four different batches of Pt-free copolymer acceptors under the same polymerization conditions. In this investigation, we selected the sample with the best photovoltaic performance, which was named as PNDIT2, for all the parallel experiments with the Pt-based terpolymers. The polymer structures were characterized via1H NMR, and the results were in good agreement with the predicted values, as shown in Fig. S4–S7, ESI.† All the polymers exhibited excellent solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and weight-average molecular weight (Mw) determined via gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 120 °C using o-dichlorobenzene solvent are listed in Table 1. When the feed ratio of the Pt complex increased from 1 to 2 and 5 mol%, Mn and Mw of the terpolymers gradually reduced; Mn/Mw decreased from 83.7/142.9 kg mol−1 for P(dbm)PtPyTPA1 to 69.3/119.9 kg mol−1 for P(dbm)PtPyTPA2 and 39.9/75.1 kg mol−1 for P(dbm)PtPyTPA5. The four batches of control copolymers exhibited Mn and Mw in the range of 55.2–119.2 and 79.9–170.0 kg mol−1, respectively (Table 2). Also, the Mn and Mw values for the representative PNDIT2 in this study were 56.5 and 100.1 kg mol−1, respectively. Thermal properties were investigated through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements, and all the polymer acceptors exhibited satisfactory thermal stabilities with high decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% weight loss) ranging from 426 to 447 °C (Table 1 and Fig. S8, ESI†).

Optical and electrochemical properties
Optical absorption properties were characterized using ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. The absorption spectra of the donor polymer PTB7-Th and series acceptor polymers are presented in Fig. 1. As shown, all the Pt-containing terpolymers exhibited similar absorption behaviors to that of the Pt-free control copolymer PNDIT2 in both solution and the film state, with two distinct absorption bands at 300–450 nm and 500–850 nm; these bands were ascribed to the π–π* transitions of local NDI segments and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transitions between the electron-deficient NDI unit and electron-rich T2 unit, respectively.45 Since the exact Pt content was definitely lower than the feed ratio, all the polymer acceptors demonstrated almost the same absorption intensity in the film states (Fig. 1b), indicating that the introduction of a small amount of Pt complex has nearly no effect on the absorption behavior. The optical bandgaps of all the polymers were calculated from the film state absorption edge, which were similar at 1.45–1.48 eV (Table 1). In addition, the absorption spectra at the film state red-shifted compared to those in solution, which might be due to the strong polymer π–π stacking behavior and intermolecular interactions.

The electrochemical properties were investigated through cyclic voltammetry (CV). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of all the polymers were calculated from the onset of oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively, using ferrocene as an internal standard. As shown in Fig. 2a, all the compounds showed irreversible oxidation and quasi-reversible reduction waves. Their HOMO levels were measured to be −5.82 to −5.79 eV, and their LUMO levels were at −3.81 to −3.78 eV (Fig. 2b and Table 1), which well-matched with those of the famous polymer donor PTB7-Th (HOMO/LUMO: −5.39/−3.45 eV) (Fig. S9, ESI†). The energy difference in the HOMO and LUMO energy levels between the polymer donor and acceptor materials was >0.3 eV, which may provide sufficient driving force for efficient exciton separation.46,47

Photovoltaic properties
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the Pt complex-based polymer acceptors, all-polymer solar cells with the conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:polymer acceptor/PDINO/Al were preliminarily fabricated. Among, poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and perylene diimide (PDI) derivative 2,9-bis[3-(dimethyloxidoamino)propyl]anthra[2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′]diisoquinoline-1,3,8,10(2H,9H)-tetrone (PDINO)48 were selected as anode and cathode interface materials, respectively, to reduce the carrier transport barrier. The active layer containing the optimized donor and acceptor weight ratio of 1.5:1 (w/w) was spin-coated from chlorobenzene solution with a film thickness of around 100 nm. Also, no additive or post-treatment was employed during device processing.
To ensure a reliable investigation, initially, parallel photovoltaic devices based on the as-synthesized four batches of PNDIT2 polymer acceptors were fabricated. The photovoltaic properties and current density–voltage (J–V) curves are presented in Table 2 and Fig. S10 (ESI†). The average PCE values of 2.10%, 1.95%, 2.27% and 2.54% were achieved from batches 1–4, respectively. It was noted that the batch 4 polymer (named PNDIT2 in this study) presented the best photovoltaic performance with the maximum PCE of 2.58%, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.77 V, short current density (Jsc) of 9.09 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 36.83%. Therefore, the PNDIT2 copolymer exhibiting the highest PCE among the four batches was selected for further comparison with the Pt-containing terpolymers, which were all synthesized in a single random polymerization reaction.
The J–V curves and EQE curves of the conventional devices based on the control copolymer PNDIT2 as well as Pt-containing random terpolymer acceptors are demonstrated in Fig. 3. Also, the key photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. By increasing the feed ratio of the Pt complex from 0 to 1, 2 and 5 mol%, the maximum PCE of the all-PSCs gradually increased from 2.58% for the reference Pt-free PNDIT2 to 3.22% for P(dbm)PtPyTPA1, 3.45% for P(dbm)PtPyTPA2 and 3.97% for P(dbm)PtPyTPA5 under the same device fabrication conditions. Additionally, the PTB7-Th:P(dbm)PtPyTPA5-blended device exhibited the best photovoltaic performance, with an average PCE value of 3.88%, which presented a dramatic improvement with 53% increase compared to 2.54% for the control PTB7-Th:PNDIT2 device. The average PCE increasing rates for the P(dbm)PtPyTPA1- and P(dbm)PtPyTPA2-containing devices were determined to be 24% and 33%, respectively. As shown in Table 2, the Voc values for all devices were nearly unchanged, whereas compared with that for the Pt-free control PNDIT2, the enhancement in PCE for the Pt-containing terpolymers was attributed to the improvement in Jsc and FF. The PNDIT2-based devices displayed average Jsc of 9.00 mA cm−2 and FF of 36.96%, which were collected from over 15 devices, whereas these values for the terpolymer acceptor P(dbm)PtPyTPAx (x = 1, 2 and 5 mol%)-containing devices gradually increased to 10.13, 10.29 and 10.80 mA cm−2 as well as 40.66%, 43.20% and 46.39%, respectively. It was found that the external quantum efficiency (EQE) variation was also consistent with the trend of PCE (Fig. 3b). The Pt-free copolymer PNDIT2 device showed the lowest EQE in the specific range of 350–450 as well as 550–750 nm, which was in good agreement with the trend of Jsc measured from the J–V curves. When the Pt complex feed ratio was increased from 0 to 5%, EQE gradually enhanced, with the maximum value increasing from 43.8% to 50.5% at 715 nm. It was observed that the PTB7-Th:P(dbm)PtPyTPA5-blended device demonstrated the highest photoresponse intensity. Clearly, the EQE curves were located above that of the control copolymer PNDIT2 in the full spectrum range of 350–800 nm.

To further confirm the PCE enhancement via the heavy-metal Pt-containing terpolymer approach, inverted devices with the configuration of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:polymer acceptor/MoO3/Ag were then fabricated. The J–V characteristic and EQE curves are shown in Fig. 4, and the key device parameters can be found in Table 3. Compared with the results for the conventional devices, an overall optimized photovoltaic performance was achieved with the inverted structures. The maximum PCE for the control PNDIT2-based device improved from 2.58% to 3.72%, corresponding to Voc of 0.80 V, Jsc of 10.41 mA cm−2 and FF of 44.62%. Similar to the results for conventional architectures, PCE also gradually increased from the Pt-free polymer acceptor PNDIT2 to the terpolymer acceptors; the average PCE increased from 3.66% for the control PNDIT2 to 4.14%, 4.54% and 4.91% for P(dbm)PtPyTPAx (x = 1, 2 and 5 mol%), which increased by a rate of 13%, 24% and 34%, respectively. The best performance was also achieved with the P(dbm)PtPyTPA5-containing device, which showed the maximum PCE of 4.99%, corresponding to Voc of 0.81 V, Jsc of 11.99 mA cm−2 and FF of 51.93%. The maximum EQE recorded at 700 nm for the terpolymer P(dbm)PtPyTPA5-based all-PSCs was measured to be 55.5%, which was also higher than 48% for the control PNDIT2-based device.

In addition, we also fabricated all-PSCs using another wide band-gap polymer donor PBDB-T. The J–V curves and EQE spectra of PBDB-T:P(dbm)PtPyTPAx (x = 0, 1, 2 and 5 mol%)-based conventional devices are shown in Fig. S11 and S12 (ESI†), respectively. Similarly, the all Pt-containing devices showed higher PCE values than the control PNDIT2, with the average PCE increasing by up to 66% (Table S2, ESI†). Slightly different to the result of PTB7-Th, the best photovoltaic properties were obtained with PBDB-T:P(dbm)PtPyTPA1 with the maximum PCE of 6.18%, corresponding to Voc of 0.86 V, Jsc of 10.84 mA cm−2 and FF of 65.99%, which were significantly higher than 3.79%, 0.86 V, 6.47 mA cm−2 and 67.93%, respectively, of the control PBDB-T:PNDIT2. These results further evidenced the PCE enhancement through the random terpolymer approach by introducing a small amount of Pt complex as a third monomer.
Charge dissociation and transportation
To gain better insights into the variation in device performance, J–V characteristics were determined by normalizing the photocurrent density (Jph) with the saturation current density (Jsat) to evaluate the charge dissociation probability P(E,T).49,50Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD represent the current densities under illumination and dark conditions, respectively. The effective voltage, Veff, was calculated from Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage when Jph is zero, and Vbias is the applied external bias voltage. It was assumed that the saturation current density (Jsat) was merely limited by the total amount of absorbed photons, and the photogenerated excitons nearly completely dissociated into free charge carriers at a high effective voltage (in this study, Veff = 4 V). It can be seen from Fig. 5a that the Pt-containing terpolymer acceptor-based all-PSCs showed higher Jph than the control PDNIT2 device. The charge dissociation probability P(E,T) is defined as P(E,T) = Jph/Jsat under the short circuit and maximum power output conditions. Therefore, the P(E,T) value was calculated to be 63.16 for the PNDIT2-based device, which increased to 69.81%, 72.73% and 76% for Pt complex-based P(dbm)PtPyTPA1, P(dbm)PtPyTPA2 and P(dbm)PtPyTPA5, respectively; this indicated that the introduction of the Pt complex into the PNDIT2 backbone induced more effective charge separation.51 In addition, the maximum photoinduced carrier generation rate, Gmax, was calculated using the equation Gmax = Jsat/(q·L), where q is the elementary charge and L is the active layer thickness.52Gmax was also found to be enhanced with the gradual increment in Pt complex, where the Gmax values obtained for all-PSCs for PNDIT2, P(dbm)PtPyTPA1, P(dbm)PtPyTPA2 and P(dbm)PtPyTPA5-based devices were 7.33, 7.90, 9.27 and 9.33 × 1027 m−3 s−1, respectively. The higher Jph, P(E,T) and Gmax values indicated better exciton dissociation and carrier generation ability.53 Thus, all-PSCs based on the Pt complex containing the terpolymer acceptors exhibited more efficient charge dissociation and generation compared to the control Pt-free copolymer PDNIT2, which was also in accordance with the higher Jsc and PCE values observed from the J–V curves. The results from the Jph–Veff curves for a more efficient charge separation obtained in the Pt complex-based terpolymers were also proven by photoluminescence (PL) quenching measurements. According to the absorption spectra of the donor PTB7-Th and acceptor polymers, the excitation wavelength for the PL quenching measurement was selected to be 620 nm. Fig. 5b shows the PL spectra of the neat PTB7-Th polymer donor, PTB7-Th:PNDIT2 and PTB7-Th:P(dbm)PtPyTPAx (x = 1, 2 and 5 mol%)-blended films. PTB7-Th exhibited a broad PL emission in the range of 680–850 nm, with a peak at around 730 nm. Also, all the donor/acceptor blended films exhibited almost complete PL quenching compared to the neat PTB7-Th film, which indicated efficient charge transport between the polymer donor and acceptor.54 More specifically, the PL quenching efficiency for PTB7-Th:PNDIT2 blends was calculated to be 93.5%, and the values for the Pt-containing terpolymers P(dbm)PtPyTPA1, P(dbm)PtPyTPA2 and P(dbm)PtPyTPA5 were 96.1%, 98.4% and 99.1%, respectively. PTB7-Th:P(dbm)PtPyTPA5 demonstrated the highest quenching efficiency, suggesting that the exciton dissociation and charge transfer between the PTB7-Th donor and P(dbm)PtPyTPA5 acceptor were the most efficient, which was in good agreement with its best photovoltaic performance. Interestingly, all the Pt-containing terpolymers exhibited more efficient PL quenching than the control PNDIT2, demonstrating that the chemical conjugation of the cyclometalated heavy-metal Pt complex to the PNDIT2 polymer backbone may facilitate charge separation in all-PSCs.

To further illustrate the PCE enhancement by the Pt-terpolymer approach, the electron mobilities of the neat polymer acceptor and charge mobilities of the donor/acceptor blends were measured via the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Hole-only devices were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Active Layer/Au, and electron-only devices were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/ZnO/Active Layer/PDINO/Al. The corresponding J–V curves fitted by the SCLC method are shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†) and Fig. 6. By gradually increasing the Pt complex feed ratio from 0, 1, 2 to 5 mol%, the electron transport abilities of the neat polymer films slightly increased from 1.98 to 2.35, 2.55 and 3.29 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The polymer donor/polymer acceptor blends also exhibited gradually increased charge mobility, with hole mobilities ranging from 2.49 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PTB7-Th:PNDIT2 to 3.61, 5.07 and 6.25 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PTB7-Th:P(dbm)PtPyTPAx (x = 1, 2 and 5 mol%), respectively. On the other hand, the electron mobility values ranged from 3.30 × 10−5 to 4.29, 4.98 and 5.61 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table S3, ESI†). The improved charge mobilities of the polymer acceptor and donor/polymer blends further explain the enhancement in photovoltaic performance.

Morphology investigation
The nanoscale morphology of the active layer of blended films plays a crucial role in exciton separation and charge transfer in organic solar cells.55,56 In this study, the film morphologies of PTB7-Th:PNDIT2 and PTB7-Th:P(dbm)PtPyTPAx (x = 1, 2 and 5 mol%) were investigated through tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). The corresponding polymer blends were prepared with the same procedure as that used for the photovoltaic device. As shown in Fig. 7, all the blended films exhibited a relatively smooth and uniform surface, indicating that the series of polymer acceptors demonstrated excellent miscibility with the donor polymer PTB7-Th. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values were as low as 0.83, 0.77, 0.75 and 0.81 nm for the copolymer PNDIT2 and terpolymer P(dbm)PtPyTPAx (x = 1, 2 and 5 mol%) blends, respectively, suggesting negligible morphology difference due to the very low ratio of Pt complex in the terpolymer acceptors.

Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized a series of heavy metal-containing terpolymer acceptors P(dbm)PyTPAx by conjugating various small amounts (1, 2 and 5 mol%) of Pt complex (dbm)PtPyTPA into the PNDIT2 polymer backbone through an ancillary ligand. Enhanced PCE values have been achieved for the PTB7-Th:polymer acceptor-based all-PSCs in both the conventional and inverted device configurations. In the conventional and inverted devices, the average PCE values gradually increase from 2.54%/3.66% for the PNDIT2 copolymer to 3.16%/4.14%, 3.39%/4.54% and 3.88%/4.91% for the terpolymer acceptors of P(dbm)PyTPA1, P(dbm)PyTPA2 and P(dbm)PyTPA5, respectively. The best photovoltaic performance has been obtained with the terpolymer acceptor of P(dbm)PtPyTPA5, with the maximum PCE values of 3.97% and 4.99%, demonstrating 54% and 39% increase compared to 2.58% and 3.72% for the Pt-free control copolymer PNDIT2, respectively. It is found that the improved Jsc and FF values contribute to the PCE enhancement by the Pt-terpolymers in the PTB7-Th-based devices, which is ascribed to higher charge mobility, more efficient charge dissociation, and less charge recombination compared to that for Pt-free copolymer. Enhancement in PCE from 3.79% for the copolymer acceptor to 6.18% for the Pt-terpolymer acceptor is also achieved in PBDB-T-containing all-PSCs. Our results demonstrate that the introduction of heavy-metal Pt complexes in terpolymer acceptors provides a simple and efficient method to further enhance the PCE of all-PSCs based on current high-performance polymer acceptors.

Materials. 
All solvents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich Co., Energy Chemical Co., and Alfa Aesar without further purification. PTB7-Th was purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. N,N′-bis(2-octyl-1-dodecyl)-2,6-dibromonaphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic acid bisimide (NDI unit) and 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (T2 unit) were purchased from Suna Tech. The Pt complex was synthesized according to literature procedures.44


Polymerization of PNDIT2. 
5,5′-Bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (73.8 mg, 0.15 mmol), N,N′-bis(2-octyl-1-dodecyl)-2,6-dibromonaphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic acid bisimide (147.8 mg, 0.15 mmol), anhydrous toluene (4 mL) and DMF (1 mL) were added to a 50 mL Schlenk bottle and purged with argon for 15 min. Then, 7.5 mg (4.3 mmol%) Pd(PPh3)4 was added to the reaction container. After flushing under argon for another 20 min, the reaction mixture was placed in an oil bath and stirred at 120 °C for 12 h. The mixture was cooled to room temperature and poured into methanol (400 mL); then, it was filtered with a Soxhlet thimble, where methanol, hexane, and chloroform (CHCl3) were used for Soxhlet extraction. Finally, the extract from chloroform was concentrated and precipitated with methanol again. After drying under vacuum, a dark purple solid was obtained (70.7%). GPC, PNDIT2: Mn = 56.5 kg mol−1, Mw = 100.1 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.77. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 8.85–8.55 (br, 2H), 7.55–7.35 (br, 4H), 4.14 (br, 4H).


Polymerization of P(dbm)PtPyTPAx. 
The synthetic methods for the other polymers were similar to that used for the control PNDIT2. The feed ratios of heavy metal Pt complex (dbm)PtPyTPA and NDI unit were 1:99, 2:98 and 5:95 (mol%), and the corresponding polymer acceptors were named P(dbm)PtPyTPA1, P(dbm)PtPyTPA2 and P(dbm)PtPyTPA5.
P(dbm)PtPyTPA1: yield (71.8%). Mn = 83.7 kg mol−1, Mw = 142.9 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.71. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 8.85–8.58 (br, 2H), 7.56–7.34 (br, 4H), 4.15 (br, 4H).
P(dbm)PtPyTPA2: yield (69.5%). Mn = 69.3 kg mol−1, Mw = 119.9 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.73. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 8.85–8.53 (br, 2H), 7.45–7.30 (br, 4H), 4.15 (br, 4H).
P(dbm)PtPyTPA5: yield (68.2%). Mn = 39.9 kg mol−1, Mw = 75.1 kg mol−1, PDI = 1.87. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, δ): 8.86–8.58 (br, 2H), 7.52–7.35 (br, 4H), 4.14 (br, 4H).


Fabrication and characterization of all-PSCs. 
All-PSCs with the conventional structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:polymer acceptor/PDINO/Al were fabricated. ITO (patterned indium tin oxide) glass was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with acetone and isopropanol solvents and treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber for 30 min. A thin film (30 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) Baytron PVP AI 4083) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass at 3500 rpm and subsequently dried at 150 °C for 15 min in air. Then, the devices were transferred to a nitrogen glove box, where the active layer of the donor polymer PTB7-Th and polymer acceptor blends were spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer with the ratio of 1.5:1 (w/w) in chlorobenzene solution with a total concentration of 15 mg mL−1 at a speed of 2800 rpm. The blends were stirred at 60 °C in the glove box for 24 h. For the PBDB-T:polymer acceptors, Cdonor = 12 mg mL−1 and Cacceptor = 6 mg mL−1. 1.5% (v/v) DIO were added as solvent additives. The active layer was spin-coated at a speed of 2700 rpm, followed by thermal annealing at 120 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, a methanol solution of PDINO at a concentration of 1.0 mg mL−1 was deposited on the active layer at 3000 rpm to afford a PDINO cathode buffer layer with thickness of ca. 10 nm. An aluminum (approx. 100 nm) layer was subsequently evaporated onto the surface of the PDINO layer under vacuum (approx. 8 × 10−5 Pa) to form the negative electrode. The active area of the device was detected to be 5 mm2 with a NIKON LV100ND optical microscope.
The inverted structure devices were fabricated based on the structure of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:polymer acceptor/MoO3/Ag. ZnO was prepared according to literature procedures57 and deposited through spin-coating onto ITO glass at 4000 rpm followed by thermal treatment at 200 °C for 1 h. The thickness of the ZnO layer was calculated to be 40 nm. Afterwards, the active layer was spin-coated under the same fabrication conditions as that used for the conventional structure. Finally, a layer of ca. 8 nm MoO3 and then an Ag layer of ca. 100 nm were evaporated under high vacuum.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSCs were measured on a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit. An Oriel Sol3A Class Solar Simulator (model, Enlitech SS-F5-3A) with a 450 W xenon lamp and an air mass 1.5 filter was used as the light source. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a Newport Oriel 91150V reference cell. The PCE results in the manuscript were obtained using more than 15 individual devices fabricated under the same conditions. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a QE-R3-011 Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System (Enli Technology, Taiwan). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell.


Mobility measurement. 
Hole mobility and electron mobility were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The hole-only devices with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:polymer acceptors/Au were used to measure the hole mobility, and the electron-only devices were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th:polymer acceptors/PDINO/Al. The hole and electron mobilities were calculated using the Mott–Gurney equation.58,59 The thickness of the active layers and buffer layers was measured with a stylus profiler (KLA Tencor P-7).
