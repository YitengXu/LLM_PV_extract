    , Accepted 25th September 2017First published on 19th October 2017AbstractInterface engineering is considered the key to improving the device performance and stability of solar cells. In particular, TiO2 nanostructures, when used as electron transporting layers (ETLs) in metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs), led to excellent power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 20%. They effectively transferred charge carriers from the perovskite and suppressed charge recombination at the interfaces. However, the photocatalytic effect of TiO2 on the perovskite can significantly degrade the device performance under ultraviolet illumination. Therefore, other classes of n-type metal oxides with a wide band gap should be developed to improve their photo-stability. Herein, we demonstrate the development of In2O3 thin films by a solution process and their application as ETLs in PSCs and organic solar cells (OSCs). Pin hole-free In2O3 ETLs obtained by the thermal decomposition of an In precursor thin film exhibit high conductivity (2.49 × 10−4 S cm−1) and low surface roughness (7.33 nm). This leads to impressive PCEs of 14.63% and 3.03% for the PSC and the inverted OSC, respectively. Furthermore, the In2O3-PSC shows better photo-stability than the TiO2-PSC by virtue of the wider band gap of In2O3, which leads to a PCE retention of 74% and 46%, relative to the initial PCE values of the PSC and the inverted OSC, respectively.
Introduction
Rapid developments in metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) predict a bright future for photovoltaics. PSCs with low-temperature and solution-processed perovskite materials have been known to exhibit high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 22.1%.1,2 The device architecture and charge transporting layers (CTLs) were derived from dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and organic solar cells (OSCs) for the optimization of device performance.1,3–5 Apart from compositional engineering and morphology control which improved the perovskite quality, many efforts on the design of high-quality CTLs resulted in the development of high-performance devices.6,7 This is attributed to the good charge transfer from the perovskite to the electrodes as well as the suppression of charge recombination at the device interfaces.8–11 Moreover, the successful development of CTLs at low temperatures (<200 °C) has demonstrated the feasibility of a flexible architecture with excellent PCEs of more than 16% in wearable devices and building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) systems.12–14 Such CTLs have shown high conductivities, suitable energy levels that are well aligned with the conduction band (CB) or the valence band (VB) of the perovskite, and their surface morphology can be controlled to avoid pin holes.
TiO2 nanostructures with metal doping or surface modification have been used to fabricate the electron transporting layers (ETLs) of PSCs.12,15–18 TiO2-based PSC devices have exhibited excellent efficiency, which increased dramatically from 9% to 21%.19–22 However, TiO2 reduces the photo-stability of PSCs under ultraviolet (UV) illumination conditions owing to its photocatalytic effect on the perovskite.23–25 Therefore, other classes of n-type metal oxides (e.g., SnO2, Zn2SnO4, BaSnO3) were developed as alternatives to TiO2. La-Doped BaSnO3-devices were found to exhibit a high PCE of 21.2%.26 SnO2 and Zn2SnO4 nanocrystals synthesized via a low-temperature (185 °C for SnO2 and 100 °C for Zn2SnO4) solution process also led to high PCEs of over 14%.27,28 The high potential of the Sn-based oxide for ETL fabrication originates from its high conductivity (∼10−4 S cm−1), wide band gap (3.7–4.1 eV), and a low CB (∼−4.2 eV), which allow for efficient charge transfer as well as photocatalytic effect suppression.29–32
Very recent studies on another n-type metal oxide, indium oxide (In2O3), have suggested that it has great potential as an ETL in PSCs owing to its high electron mobility (>10 cm2 V−1 s−1) and wide band gap (3.7–3.9 eV).33 Fang et al. and Que et al. demonstrated the synthesis of conductive In2O3 thin films using a sol–gel process in the temperature range of 200–500 °C and the PCEs of the In2O3-PSCs were found to be in the range of 13–15%.34,35 As the electron mobility and conductivity of In2O3 can be significantly affected by the crystallinity and the concentration of oxygen vacancies, it is crucial to characterize In2O3 films in order to optimize the device performance. However, a detailed characterization on In2O3 ETLs in PSCs and the relationship between the electrical properties of the In2O3 ETL and the device performance is still lacking. Further, the hygroscopic In precursor (In(NO3)3·xH2O) strongly reacts with the water molecules in the solvent, producing indium hydroxides. This prevents the fabrication of pin hole-free and highly uniform In2O3 layers. The sol–gel process takes a long time to prepare the precursor solution (6 h); therefore, a facile protocol should be developed in order to deposit high quality In2O3 thin films more effectively. A rational design of In2O3 films which allows for a controlled electron mobility and surface morphology via an effective fabrication process would yield an optimized device performance as well as an improved photo-stability.
Herein, we report the facile preparation of high quality In2O3 ETLs for highly efficient PSCs and OSCs. In precursor films were deposited onto an indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate via spin coating of an In(NO3)3·xH2O solution. Their rapid decomposition and oxidation were initiated at 270 °C and a number of oxygen vacancies were created. The optimized In2O3 ETLs at 300 °C exhibited a high conductivity of 2.49 × 10−3 S cm−1 and an electron mobility of 6.57 cm2 V−1 s−1 while retaining a pin hole-free and smooth film morphology, leading to an impressive PCE of 14.63% (average 13.42%) with hysteresis-less behavior. The In2O3 ETL was further applied in a poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bulk heterojunction OSC, and exhibited a PCE of 3.03%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of In2O3 ETL in OSCs. Moreover, In2O3-PSCs demonstrated better photo-stability than TiO2-PSCs due to the wider band gap of In2O3, showing retentions of 74% and 46% relative to the initial values measured under 1 sun illumination for 4 h.
Experimental

PEDOT:PSS (AI 4083) was purchased from Clevios. PbI2 (99.9985%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) (99.98%) was purchased from Dyesol. Poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA, Mn = 17500 g mol−1) was purchased from EM Index. The indium precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.1 M indium nitrate hydrate in anhydrous ethanol. The CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution was prepared via the Lewis base adduct approach according to a previous report; 461 mg of PbI2, 159 mg of MAI, and 78 mg of DMSO were mixed with 600 mg of DMF.36,37 The P3HT/PCBM solution was prepared by dissolving 1 wt% P3HT and 1 wt% PCBM in 1 mL of CB at 60 °C for 30 min. A PTAA solution was prepared by dissolving 15 mg of PTAA in 1 mL of toluene. For Li-doping, 15 μL of Li-TFSi/ACN (170 mg of Li-TFSi in 1 mL of ACN) and 15 μL of tBP/ACN (1:1, v/v) were added to the PTAA solution. The PEDOT:PSS solution was modified by mixing 1 wt% Triton X-100. All the solutions were prepared in a N2-filled glove box.

Fabrication of In2O3-PSCs. 
The indium precursor solution was spin coated onto a patterned-glass/ITO substrate (2.5 cm × 2.5 cm) at 3000 rpm for 30 s in a N2-filled glove box. Before spin coating, the substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 10 min. The precursor films were annealed immediately at T = 200–500 °C for 1 h in air. After cooling the samples at room temperature, the CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution was spin coated onto the sample at 4000 rpm for 25 s and 0.5 mL of diethyl ether was dripped for 10 s on the rotating sample. This sample was heated at 65 °C for 1 min and at 100 °C for 2 min. The PTAA solution was spin coated onto the perovskite at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Later, an Au contact layer was deposited at a constant rate of 0.5 Å s−1 by thermal evaporation. The deposition of the perovskite and PTAA layers was performed at a relative humidity of 25%.


Fabrication of In2O3-OSCs. 
The P3HT/PCBM solution was spin coated onto the In2O3 ETLs at 750 rpm for 60 s. After spin coating, the samples were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. The modified PEDOT:PSS solution was spin coated onto the P3HT/PCBM layer at 4000 rpm for 60 s. After thermal annealing to remove any residual water, an Au contact layer was deposited at a constant rate of 0.5 Å by thermal evaporation. The layer deposition was carried out in a N2-filled glove box.

Characterization
Thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) was performed using a TG-differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) instrument (STA 409 PC/PG, NETZSCH). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out using an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Ultima IV). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a scanning XPS microprobe (PHI 5000 VersaProbe, Ulvac-PHI). Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Innova, Bruker) images of the ETLs were recorded in the tapping mode. Hall measurements were performed at 25 °C and a magnetic flux density of 0.31 T (HMS-3000, Ecopia). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were performed at the PL maxima of the perovskite (760 nm) using a time-correlated single photon counting module (TCPSC, MPD-PDM Series DET-40 photon counting detector and a Pendulum CNT-91 frequency counter); this module was combined with a monochromator and a second-harmonic-generated 400 nm laser, derived from an 800 nm Ti:Sapphire laser (Mai Tai, Spectra-Physics), which served as the detector and the excitation source, respectively. The J–V curves were obtained using a Keithley model 2400 source meter unit. A 150 W xenon lamp in a solar simulator was used as the light source. The light intensity was adjusted to AM 1.5G using a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell. An active area of 0.12 cm2 was defined using a metal mask. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were generated using an incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) equipment (PV Measurement, Inc.). The photo-stability test of the solar cells was performed under 1 sun illumination, at a relative humidity of 30% and T = 32 °C for 4 h. The devices were not encapsulated.
Results and discussion
To obtain the desirable morphology of the In2O3 films, In(NO3)3·xH2O should be dissolved in an anhydrous polar solvent because dissociated In3+ reacts vigorously with water molecules, which creates white In(OH3)3 precipitates in the solution within 20 min according to the reaction shown in eqn (1).38 In3+(aq) + 3H2O(aq) → In(OH)3(s) + 3H+(aq)(1)
These unwanted In(OH3)3 crystals remain within the precursor film after spin coating the solution. Later, large In2O3 particles were generated upon sintering the film. Other indium precursors including In(AcAc)3 and InCl3 also followed the same reaction mechanism. The white precipitates were generated in the solutions within 1 h, while anhydrous alcohols induce high stability in In3+ without any other reactions, as shown in ESI Fig. S1.† Since the solubility of In(NO3)3·xH2O is excellent among the precursors, it could be a suitable candidate to fabricate In2O3 ETLs. After spin coating the In precursor solution (0.1 M) onto an ITO substrate, In2O3 ETLs were fabricated at different annealing temperatures. The different behaviors of In2O3 during formation and crystallization would lead to distinct film morphologies. Fig. 1 shows the AFM images of the In2O3 ETLs annealed in the range of 200–500 °C. At T = 200 °C, nanoparticles ranging in size from 20 nm to 60 nm were uniformly coated on the ITO surface, leading to a low average surface roughness (Ra) of 5.84 nm (Fig. 1A). At higher temperatures (T = 300 °C), Ostwald ripening of the nanoparticles took place and the Ra slightly increased to 7.33 nm but no pin holes could be observed (Fig. 1B). However, small pin holes of 50–100 nm size were formed at T = 400 °C and the Ra was dramatically increased to 14.58 nm; at this temperature, the aggregation effect of the nanoparticles became more dominant (Fig. 1C). Thermal annealing of the films at T = 500 °C generated many pin holes and their size was also enlarged (200 nm–1 μm) (Fig. 1D). It should be noted that a high annealing temperature led to the generation of pin holes as well as dramatically increased the Ra up to 21.25 nm, which led to a direct contact between the perovskite and ITO.

The decomposition process of the In precursor was thoroughly investigated using TG-DTA. The transformation of In(NO3)3·xH2O into In(OH)3 progressed before the In2O3 crystals were formed.39 From the DTA plot shown in Fig. 2A, the melting point of In(NO3)3·xH2O and the released exothermic reaction energy were found to be T = 135.5 °C and −1.15 μV mg−1, respectively. The abrupt decrease in the weight at this point is ascribed to the dehydration of the precursor melt. After dehydration, In(OH)3 was formed by the decomposition of In(NO3)3 at ∼150 °C, at which point additional weight loss was observed. The heat flow significantly increased up to T = 270 °C, indicating the rapid transformation of In(OH)3 into In2O3. The crystallization of In2O3 started at the inflection point of T = 270 °C and was completed at T = 480 °C, suggesting that the annealing temperature should be higher than T = 270 °C in order to obtain highly crystalline In2O3. Vigorous crystallization started at T = 371 °C and the peak of the absorbed energy was found to be 0.776 μV mg−1. Furthermore, the decomposition–crystallization behavior of the films agreed with the XRD analysis results (Fig. 2B). The characteristic peak of (222) emerged at T = 200 °C, but the intensity was very low. The peak intensity significantly increased at T = 300 °C; the peak intensity of (222) at this temperature was 10 times higher than that of its counterpart at T = 200 °C. This is because crystallization started at T = 270 °C, as indicated in the DTA graph. Sintering at T = 400 °C further enhanced the crystallinity of the films and the crystallization process was completed at T = 500 °C. From the estimation of full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the XRD spectra, the values at (222) were found to be 1.39, 1.07, and 0.67 for 300 °C, 400 °C and 500 °C, respectively. This suggests that the high crystallinity of the In2O3 ETLs was obtained at 500 °C, and they would have excellent electrical conductivity.

The differences in atomic bonding with a variation in the annealing temperature were clearly revealed in the XPS results. When the In precursor decomposed, the atomic bonds around In3+ were broken and new bonds were created with oxygen atoms and hydroxyl groups. Fig. 3 shows the XPS O 1s spectra of In2O3 ETLs annealed at T = 200–500 °C; the spectra were calibrated by centering the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. The spectral peaks of In–O, oxygen vacancy (Ovac), and In–OH were observed at binding energies of 529.9 eV, 531.3 eV, and 532.5 eV, respectively.40,41 It should be noted that the peak intensity of In–O and Ovac significantly increased while that of In–OH decreased at T > 300 °C (Fig. 3A and B). The bonding ratio of In–O and Ovac increased from 58.62% to 68.08% and from 9.19% to 22.9%, respectively. This result was mainly attributed to the dehydroxylation of In(OH3)3. The bonding ratio of In–OH dropped from 32.19% to 9.02%. However, hydroxyl molecules were still present in the In2O3 ETLs since hydrogen continuously reacted with oxygen during thermal annealing.42 When the thin films were further oxidized at T = 400 °C and 500 °C, there were negligible changes in the peak intensity, which suggested that the bonding ratio was already saturated at T = 300 °C, even though the crystallization of In2O3 was not yet complete (Fig. 3C and D). The XPS results are summarized in ESI Table S1.†

The electrical properties of In2O3 can be determined by the bonding ratio of Ovac. As the annealing temperature increased, enrichment of Ovac took place, leading to an increase in the carrier concentration of In2O3. This implies that high electron mobility of In2O3 would be achieved upon annealing at T > 300 °C. The carrier concentration (n) and electron mobility (μ) of In2O3 estimated by using the Hall effect measurements are shown in Fig. 4A. The carrier concentration increased from 1.53 × 1014 cm−3 to 3.12 × 1016 cm−3 and μ increased from 0.68 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 8.65 cm2 V−1 s−1, when the annealing temperature was increased from 200 °C to 500 °C. In particular, the n and μ values were found to be 2.37 × 1015 cm−3 and 6.57 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, at T = 300 °C. Furthermore, the conductivity (σ) of the In2O3 thin films was estimated in order to compare their charge transport ability with that of the TiO2 ETLs used in PSCs (Fig. 4B). Conductivity can be calculated according to eqn (2) σ = neμ,(2)where e is the elementary charge of an electron (1.6 × 10−19 C). The increase in conductivity was proportional to the temperature; the conductivities were found to be 1.66 × 10−5, 2.49 × 10−3, 1.88 × 10−2, and 4.31 × 10−2 S cm−1, at T = 200, 300, 400, and 500 °C, respectively. The conductivity at T = 300 °C was 10 times higher than that of Nb-doped TiO2.12 The carrier concentrations, electron mobilities, and conductivities of the In2O3 ETLs are summarized in Table 1.

However, the trade-off relationship between the film morphology and conductivity of the In2O3 ETLs should be considered in order to design high performance solar cells. Although the films obtained at T > 400 °C exhibited high conductivity, the large number of generated pin holes would lead to a direct contact between the perovskite and ITO, as described earlier. Moreover, increasing surface roughness of the films would increase the resistance at the interface of the In2O3 ETL and the perovskite. In this regard, the In2O3 ETL annealed at T = 300 °C satisfies the film morphology and conductivity requirements simultaneously. Fig. 5A shows the cross-sectional field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) image of the PSC. After a 50 nm-thick In2O3 ETL was deposited on an ITO/glass substrate, a 450 nm-thick highly crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 layer was deposited using a Lewis-base adduct approach (ESI Fig. S2†).36,37 Subsequently, a 70 nm-thick poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) layer was deposited on the substrate via spin coating. Finally, a 100 nm-thick Au contact layer was deposited by thermal evaporation. Fig. 5B shows the energy diagram of the device and describes the movement of the charge carriers generated at the perovskite through their respective CTLs. Due to the suitable band alignment of In2O3 with the perovskite as well as its high conductivity, efficient electron injection and transfer from the perovskite would be facilitated.35Fig. 5C exhibits the J–V curves of the In2O3-PSCs at T = 200–500 °C. At T = 200 °C, the PCEs were found to be 7.82% and 6.01% for the backward and forward sweeps, respectively, at a scan delay time of 200 ms. The low PCE and severe hysteresis of the device were attributed to the low conductivity of the In2O3 ETLs. On the other hand, the higher conductivity of the ETLs at T = 300 °C significantly enhanced the PCE to 14.63% during the backward sweep and led to a hysteresis-less behavior of the device (the PCE was found to be 14.07% during the forward sweep). It should be observed that the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) were 1.032 V, 22.48 mA cm−2, and 0.631, respectively. However, at T = 400 °C and 500 °C, the PCEs for the backward sweep dropped to 12.92% and 10.39%, respectively. Charge recombination at the interface of the In2O3 ETL and ITO became dominant at T > 400 °C because the exposed areas of the ITO were in direct contact with the perovskite. The generation of pin holes in the metal oxide thin layer is strongly dependent on the film thickness and annealing temperature. For example, the morphology of the SnO2 ETLs was determined by the annealing temperature.31 The increasing temperature (T = 500 °C) induced Ostwald ripening of SnO2 nanocrystals, thereby the electrode was exposed to the perovskite, which significantly degraded the PCEs from 15.10% to 10.39%.31 Moreover, the TiO2 ETLs prepared using the anodic oxidation of Ti thin films exhibited their increasing pin hole density as the Ti film thickness decreased at room temperature.43 The optimized TiO2 thickness was found to be 50 nm, since the thinner ETLs (20 nm) possessed a number of pin holes and they exhibited poor device performance.43 In this regard, the film thickness and annealing temperature of the In2O3 ETLs were optimized under the present conditions.

TRPL decays were measured to investigate the charge transfer and recombination behaviors at the interface of the perovskite and the In2O3 ETLs (Fig. 5D). The inset indicates the process of PL measurement of the samples (glass/In2O3/perovskite). A 400 nm wavelength laser incident through a glass substrate excited the charge carriers in the perovskite and PL was detected at 760 nm. The PL decay curves and the corresponding PL lifetimes (τ) were fitted with a bi-exponential decay function. A fast decay (τ1) indicates PL quenching from the perovskite to the In2O3 ETLs while a slow decay (τ2) corresponds to radiative decay within the perovskite.44 The PL decay and PL lifetimes of the samples are considerably affected by the annealing temperature. The average PL lifetimes were found to be 12.51, 1.95, 3.28, and 6.14 ns at T = 200, 300, 400, and 500 °C, respectively. The PL lifetimes became shorter rapidly as the amplitude related to fast decay increased, which suggested that charge extraction and transfer from the perovskite became dominant.45 Furthermore, the depopulation of charge carriers became more dominant as they were collected at the interface of the In2O3 ETL and the perovskite, accompanying delayed radiative recombination.45,46 Therefore, we concluded that high quality In2O3 ETLs efficiently transferred charge carriers and suppressed charge recombination, thus improving the Jsc and Voc simultaneously. The fitted parameters in the TRPL analysis of the In2O3 ETLs are summarized in ESI Table S2.†

Fig. 5E exhibits the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the In2O3-PSCs. At T = 300 °C and 400 °C, the spectral peaks appeared at around 550–600 nm and their intensity was retained up to 650 nm. However, for T = 200 °C and 500 °C, the spectral intensity started to decrease at around 450 nm and it considerably dropped up to 700 nm, which was attributed to the suppression of charge transfer from the In2O3 ETL to ITO.47 These observations were reflected in the integrated Jsc of the devices, which showed excellent agreement with the Jsc measured from the J–V curves. The integrated Jsc was found to be 16.31, 21.29, 20.25, and 17.81 mA cm−2 at T = 200, 300, 400, and 500 °C, respectively. The average PCE of 20 devices was found to be 13.42%, which indicates the high reproducibility in device performance (Fig. 5F). The photo-stability of the devices was also tested under 1 sun illumination and compared with that of mesoporous TiO2-PSCs. The J–V curves of the TiO2-device are shown in ESI Fig. S3.† After 4 h, the normalized PCEs of the In2O3- and mesoporous TiO2-PSCs dropped to 74% and 46%, respectively, of the initial values (PCE = 14.57% and 17.21%, respectively) at a relative humidity of 30% (ESI Fig. S4†). This large deviation in the device stability was mainly attributed to the suppressed photocatalytic effect of In2O3 on the perovskite. Because the band gap of In2O3 (3.7–3.9 eV) is much larger than that of TiO2 (∼3.5 eV), UV absorption by the ETLs could be minimized. Therefore, using In2O3 ETLs would be helpful in improving the photo-stability of PSCs.
Recent studies on the feasibility of ZnO and InZnO as ETLs in OSCs have demonstrated that such ETLs modified with self-assembled monolayers or fullerene doping significantly improved the PCEs up to 10.31%.48,49 In particular, the ZnO-based P3HT:PCBM OSCs exhibited the PCEs of 1.43% and 4.18%.50,51 The ZnO ETLs were simply prepared using spray coating and atomic layer deposition (ALD). Therefore, the high potential of In2O3 as an ETL can also be exhibited in the bulk heterojunction OSCs. Fig. 6A shows the energy diagram of an inverted P3HT:PCBM OSC, which indicates that the photogenerated charge carriers at the interface of P3HT and PCBM moved toward their respective CTLs. The 150 nm-thick P3HT:PCBM layer was deposited onto the In2O3 ETL by spin coating a P3HT:PCBM solution (P3HT:PCBM = 1:1, w/w). Subsequently, the sample was annealed at 100 °C in a N2 environment to induce phase separation between P3HT and PCBM.52 To deposit the 40 nm-thick PEDOT:PSS hole transporting layer, the PEDOT:PSS solution was mixed with 1 wt% Triton X-100 to reduce the surface tension of the hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS. As such, it improved the wettability of PEDOT:PSS on the hydrophobic P3HT:PCBM layer (ESI Fig. S5†).52 Finally, a 100 nm-thick Au contact layer was deposited using thermal evaporation. Fig. 6B exhibits the J–V curves of the P3HT:PCBM OSCs. The best performance of the device was found at T = 300 °C, similar to the case of the PSCs. The PCEs were found to be 0.746%, 3.03%, 2.44%, and 1.79% at T = 200, 300, 400, and 500 °C, respectively. The decrease in PCEs at T = 400 °C and 500 °C was attributed to the direct contact between P3HT:PCBM and ITO. At 200 °C, the low conductivity of the In2O3 ETL suppressed electron transfer from the PCBM. The low Voc of the devices compared to the conventional OSCs was mainly attributed to the degradation of the P3HT:PCBM layers during the deposition of PEDOT:PSS. Since water in a PEDOT:PSS solution easily oxidized P3HT and PCBM, a number of trap sites were created.53 The charge recombination became dominant as their trap density increased, which led to the Voc loss.53Fig. 6C shows the EQE spectra of the devices. The peak intensity was saturated from 420 nm to 520 nm in all the cases and shoulder peaks corresponding to P3HT were observed at 600 nm. The integrated Jsc of the devices was found to be 5.12, 9.26, 8.49, and 7.38 mA cm−2 at T = 200, 300, 400, and 500 °C, respectively. The photovoltaic parameters of In2O3-PSCs and OSCs are summarized in Table 2. Similar trends were observed in the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) of PSCs and OSCs with respect to the change in the annealing temperature (Fig. 6D). At T = 300 °C, the Rs values of the PSC and OSC were found to be 33 Ω and 74 Ω, respectively, while their Rsh values were 13.55 kΩ and 7.96 kΩ. The absence of pin holes in the In2O3 ETLs substantially enhances Rsh, leading to a minimized charge carrier loss by recombination. Furthermore, the high conductivity of In2O3 ETLs facilitates charge transfer and reduces interfacial resistance, leading to a low Rs. The Rs and Rsh values of both devices are summarized in ESI Table S3.†

Conclusions
In conclusion, we developed pin hole-free and conductive In2O3 thin films as efficient ETLs for PSCs and OSCs. The In precursor solution was simply prepared by dissolving In(NO3)3·xH2O in anhydrous ethanol in order to prevent the formation of In(OH)3 particles. From TG-DTA and XRD analyses, it could be deduced that the In precursor films fully decomposed into In2O3 at T > 270 °C. XPS analysis provided an overview of the variation in the atomic bonds during the decomposition of the In precursor. In particular, the exact concentration of Ovac that determined the electrical properties of In2O3 could be inferred. At T = 300 °C, the electron mobility and conductivity of the In2O3 ETL were found to be 6.57 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.49 × 10−3 S cm−1, respectively. However, many pin holes were observed in the In2O3 ETLs when T > 400 °C, which led to a direct contact between the solar absorbing layers and the ITO layer even though their conductivity was as high as 4.31 × 10−2 S cm−1 (for T = 500 °C). This degraded the device performance significantly; on the other hand, the high quality In2O3 ETLs produced at T = 300 °C led to impressive PCEs of 14.63% and 3.03% for the PSC and OSC, respectively. Both devices showed similar trends in the device performance with respect to the variation in the annealing temperature, suggesting that the electrical properties and film morphology of In2O3 ETLs are responsible for the charge transfer and recombination in solar cells. Moreover, the In2O3 ETLs with their wide band gap improved the photo-stability of the PSCs as compared to that of TiO2-PSCs. Further modification of In2O3via chemical doping, tuning its crystallinity, and surface treatment would be explored in the future to enhance device performance.
