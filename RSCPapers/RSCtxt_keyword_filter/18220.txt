    , Accepted 28th October 2019First published on 29th October 2019AbstractAs an alternative to silicon-based solar cells, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention and achieved a comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) to silicon-based ones, although the perovskite materials can absorb only visible light. Hence, the challenge remains to enhance the PCE utilizing near infrared (NIR) light in the solar light spectrum. One of the easiest ways to utilize the NIR is to incorporate NIR active materials in PSCs such as up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs); however, such a stratergy is not simple to adopt in PSCs due to the inherent vurnerability of perovskite materials towards moisture. In this work, we present NIR-utilizing PSCs by locating UCNPs within the PSC structure by a simple dry transfer method. A maximum PCE of 15.56% was obtained in the case of PSC having the UCNPs located between the hole transport layer (HTL) and gold (Au) top electrode, which is an 8.4% enhancement compared to the cell without the UCNPs. This enhancement came from the combined effects of NIR light utilization and the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) phenomenon originating from the Au top electrode, which was interfacing the UCNPs.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials such as methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), etc. have been considered for next generation solar cells owing to their outstanding optical properties such as a low exciton binding energy under 50 meV, high absorbance in the visible light range, long carrier diffusion length in perovskite thin films,1–5 and so on. Due to these advantages, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has skyrocketed up to 23.7%, which is similar to that (27.6%) of conventional silicon solar cells.6
Photo-active perovskite films have an inherent band gap of about 1.55 eV,7,8 resulting in absorption of only visible light. Utilizing non-visible sunlight, which accounts for 50% of the solar specturm,9 has been one of the key challenges to enhance the PCE of PSCs. Previous studies reported that UV light accelerated degradation of the perovskite layer,10,11 and thus many researchers have been focusing on using NIR rather than UV light.12 Up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are a potential candidate for utilizing NIR owing to their ability to convert two or more low energy photons to a single high energy photon.13–15 Since Jang et al. reported UCNP-embedded PSCs,16 various compositions of the UCNPs and their complexes have been applied to PSCs to enhance the PCE by converting from NIR to visible light.9,17,18 However, it was still hard to achieve a dramatic enhancement in PCE from those approaches. This stemmed from a low up-conversion efficiency (UCE) of the UCNPs because the lanthanide ions in the UCNPs are limited to absorb only the short wavelength range (around 980 nm) in the light spectrum, and have the forbidden nature of f–f transitions.19 Consequently, overcoming the inherently low UCE of the UCNPs is highly demanded to improve the PCE of PSCs.
The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) phenomenon with novel metals, which has been utilized to further enhance the PCE of PSCs,20,21 was also exploited to increase the UCE of UCNPs.22–24 The increase in the UCE could be accomplished by the local distribution of electromagnetic fields originating from the SPR phenomenon of metals.22,23 In addition, geometrical formations of the metals were manipulated to obtain a significant enhancement in UCE by focusing the surface plasmon polariton onto hotspots, leading to strong local electromagnetic fields.25–29 However, fabrication processes of such metal-supported UCNPs were too complicated to apply within the perovskite film. Particularly, due to the vulnerable nature of perovskites towards moisture, the use of solution techniques such as drop, dip, and spin coating was highly restricted for nanoparticle transfer. Recently, a lanthanide-doped NaYF4 thin film (up-converting layer) was sputtered onto the top electrode of a PSC and an additional silver (Ag) layer was deposited on top of the up-converting layer to induce the SPR phenomena at the NaYF4/Ag interface.30 Although this work demonstrated the first application of plasmon-enhanced up-conversion materials in PSCs, a transparent top electrode, i.e., NiO/Ag/NiO, was necessary not only for sunlight to reach the up-converting layer, but also to allow the up-converted light to bounce back to the underlying perovskite layer. Moreover, the UCE of a thin film-type upconverting layer is inherently low to apply to PSCs.31,32
Herein, we tried the use of NIR of sunlight by using UCNPs in perovskite solar cells. The dry transfer technique enabled to insert UCNPs onto any location within the PSC structure without damaging the underlying perovskite film. To achieve high-performance PSCs embedded with UCNPs, the effect of UCNP location within the PSC structure was explored. Effective improvement in photovoltaic (PV) performances was achieved only when the UCNPs were located underneath the Au top electrode. This is because the Au electrode acted as not only an electrode for hole extraction, but also a plasmonic substance, resulting in enhanced up-conversion emission of the UCNPs due to surface plasmon resonance (SPR) of the Au electrode. Such a use of the Au electrode as a substance for the surface plasmon resonance phenomenon could pave a new way for high efficiency PSCs with functional photonic materials.

Ethanol (HPLC grade) was purchased from Duksan (South Korea). Lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99%) and formamidinium iodide (FAI, 99%) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry. TiO2 paste (18-NR) was purchased from Dyesol (South Korea).
2.2. Synthesis of silica-coated NaYF4:Yb3+Er3+ up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)
Silica-coated UCNPs were synthesized according to previously reported procedures.33–35 YCl3·6H2O (0.78 mmol), YbCl3·6H2O (0.20 mmol), and ErCl3·6H2O (0.02 mmol) were mixed with 8 ml of oleic acid and 15 ml of 1-octadecene in a 50 ml flask under a nitrogen atmosphere. The mixed solution was heated to 160 °C for 30 min with stirring, and cooled down to room temperature. 10 ml of NaOH (0.25 M) and NH4F (0.4 M) in methanol was injected to the solution, and then stirred for 30 min at room temperature to obtain UCNPs. The solution was heated to 100 °C and maintained for 30 min to evaporate the methanol, and the temperature was increased to 300 °C for 1 h. The synthesized UCNPs were washed with ethanol using a centrifuge (9500 rpm for 20 min) three times. To coat the silica shells on the UCNPs, 0.1 ml of CO-520 and 0.4 ml of cyclohexane were injected into the UCNP solution (5 mg of UCNPs in 1.4 ml of cyclohexane). Ammonium hydroxide solution (16 μl) was then added to the solution, and sonicated for 30 min. Next, 5 μl of TEOS was injected into the solution and stirred overnight. Finally, acetone was added to the solution to precipitate silica-coated UCNPs, and the particles were washed with a mixture of ethanol:water (1:1 v/v) using a centrifuge twice. The silica-coated UCNPs were stored in deionized (DI) water.
2.3. Fabrication of UCNP-incorporated perovskite solar cells
A fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate was cleaned for 15 min in the sequence of acetone, isopropyl alcohol, and deionized water and dried with a nitrogen gun. The substrate was further cleaned using UV ozone for 15 min. After UV ozone treatment, a compact TiO2 layer acting as a hole blocker was deposited onto the cleaned FTO substrate by spin-coating a TiO2 stock solution of 0.15 M titanium butoxide in 1-butanol at 2000 rpm for 40 s. After spin-coating, the substrate was dried on a hot-plate at 125 °C for 5 min to remove the residual solvent. Then, the TiO2 layer was sintered at 550 °C for 30 min in a furnace to transform the TiO2 phase from rutile to anatase. The mesoporous TiO2 layer as an ETL was formed by spin-coating TiO2 paste, which was composed of 30 nm nanoparticles (NPs) in 2-methoxyethanol (1:5 weight ratio), at 4000 rpm for 15 s onto the TiO2 blocking layer. The sample was dried at 125 °C for 5 min and then sintered at 550 °C for 1 h to burn out the polymer ligands wrapping around the TiO2 NPs.
The perovskite precursor solution was prepared with 1.2 M PbI2 (99%, Sigma Aldrich), 1.02 M methylammonium iodide (MAI, 99.5%, Sigma Aldrich), 0.18 M formamidinium iodide (FAI, 99.5%, Sigma Aldrich) and 1.2 M DMSO (99%, Sigma Aldrich) in DMF (99%, Sigma Aldrich). The solution was then stirred at room temperature for 6 h. An approximately 300 nm-thick (MAPbI3)0.85(FAPbI3)0.15 layer was deposited by spin-coating the precursor solution at 3500 rpm for 40 s. 80 μL of toluene was dropped for 15 s prior to finishing the spin-coating to instantaneously remove the DMF within the perovskite film. The as-deposited perovskite film was annealed on a hot plate at 120 °C for 10 min, and cooled to room temperature. After that, a spiro-OMeTAD layer as a hole-transport layer (HTL) was deposited onto the perovskite layer by spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 20 s. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD in 1 ml of chlorobenzene and then adding 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5 μl of a stock solution of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI 520 mg in 1 ml of acetonitrile). To transfer UCNPs via the dry transfer method, a solution containing the silica-coated UCNPs (0.5 mg ml−1 in DI water) was dropped on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate and dried. The UCNP-coated PDMS substrate was attached to the HTL under 9.8 kPa for 2 min, and detached from the HTL within 3 s, leaving the UCNPs on the HTL. Finally, a 75 nm gold electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation. All processes for the fabrication of UCNP-containing PSCs were performed in a glovebox filled with high purity N2 gas (99.999%) as illustrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
2.4. Characterization
The shape, size, and uniformity of UCNPs were measured by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai 12, FEI, USA). The crystal structures of UCNPs and the perovskite film were obtained by using a X-ray diffraction (XRD) system (D8 discover, Bruker, MA., USA). The morphology of the UCNP-incorporated perovskite thin film was observed with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL 2020F) at an acceleration voltage of 10 keV.
2.5. Measurement
Up-conversion emission spectra were recorded by using an Andor Shamrock SR-500i-A spectrometer (Andor Tech) equipped with a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (DV420A-OE, Andor Tech) and 980 nm laser (SSL-LM-980-600-D, Shanghai Sanctity Laser Technology, Shanghai, China) as an excitation source of UCNPs. The current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSC were measured by using a Keithley Model 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G illumination at a power density of 100 ± 2.5 mW cm−2 (SANEI solar simulator, Class A). The PV performances were measured under ambient atmosphere without any passivation.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the characterization of NaYF4:Yb3+Er3+ nanoparticles coated with a SiO2 shell (silica-coated NaYF4:Yb3+Er3+ nanoparticles are denoted as up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) in the following context). As shown in the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Fig. 1a, the UCNPs were synthesized with an average particle size of about 40 nm having a uniform 3 nm thick silica shell. The crystal structure of the UCNPs was confirmed by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. 1b), which was well coincident with JCPDS standard card no. 28-1192. The emission spectrum of the UCNPs under 980 nm (NIR) laser illumination and the absorption spectrum of the perovskite film are presented in Fig. 1c. The main emission peaks of UCNPs were located at 522 nm, 541 nm, and 658 nm, corresponding to 2H11/2 → 4I15/2, 4S3/2 → 4I15/2, and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions in the energy levels of Yb3+ and Er3+, respectively (Fig. S2 (ESI†)).13 The up-converted emission peaks of the UCNPs were located at the wavelengths of green and red light in the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum. However, only green light was observed by the naked eye as shown in the digital image of Fig. 1d under NIR irradiation because the CCD camera (DV420A-OE, Andor) used in this PL measurement had a higher sensitivity at the wavelengths corresponding to red light. Considering that the perovskite film had high absorption properties at 500–550 nm as shown in Fig. 1c, the up-converted green light from the UCNPs by NIR can effectively be absorbed by the perovskite film.

To confirm whether the perovskite thin film effectively absorbed the light emitted by UCNPs, UCNPs were transferred onto the hole transporting layer (HTL)/perovskite films by the dry transfer method. Please note that the drop, dip, and spin coating methods could not be used to disperse the UCNPs on the PSC, because the perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD (acting as the HTL) films were vulnerable to various solvents such as DI water, ethanol, and organic solvents, which was proved by a drop of UCNP-containing DI water as shown in Fig. S3a (ESI†). The spiro-OMeTAD on the perovskite thin film, where the solution was in contact, became yellowish after dropping; the yellow-colored material was PbI2, resulting from perovskite degradation. In addition, the perovskite film spontaneously became yellowish along the DI water traces, indicating instant decomposition of the perovskite (Fig. S3b, ESI†).
In this study, the dry transfer method was introduced to disperse UCNPs onto the HTL without damaging the underlying perovskite film, as shown in Fig. 2a. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate was used for the dry transfer of UCNPs thanks to its hydrophobic surface nature being advantageous for transferring materials on a target substrate.36,37 The UCNPs were coated on the PDMS substrate by conventional drop coating and the solvent of the UCNP solution was completely dried in an oven. The UCNP-coated PDMS was attached to the HTL for 2 min and detached in order to transfer the UCNPs. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of Fig. 2b shows the transferred UCNPs on the HTL/perovskite film. Fig. 2c shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the UCNP-transferred perovskite thin film. Only perovskite peaks appeared at 14.08° and 28.38° with no observable PbI2 peak (12.10°), confirming no degradation of the perovskite film.38 The peaks from UCNPs were not detected because the penetration depth of X-ray was too deep to detect the tiny UCNPs on the uppermost surface. These results demonstrated that the UCNPs were successfully transferred without damaging the perovskite film underneath by the dry-transfer method.

To investigate whether the upconversion light emitted from the UCNPs was effectively absorbed by the perovskite layer, a UCNPs/HTL/perovskite/FTO was fabricated, which had the same structure as the PSC without the ETL and Au top electrode. Near infrared (NIR) light was irradiated on both sides of the sample as shown in Fig. 3. In the case of Fig. 3a, NIR irradiated the UCNPs directly and the up-converted PL was collected by using a CCD camera without any absorption. In contrast, in the case of Fig. 3b, the up-converted PL at the bottom was collected after passing through the HTL/perovskite/FTO. Some of the up-converted PL could be absorbed by the perovskite during penetration.

As expected, a reduction in PL intensity was observed due to the absorption of up-converted PL by the perovskite film (Fig. 3c). The PL intensities of both samples were normalized to the PL peak at 698 nm. The green PL spectrum of the sample shown in Fig. 3b was vaguely seen (the black area in the magnified spectra in the middle) when overlapped with that of the sample shown in Fig. 3a. The reduction ratio of I3b/I3a for green and red PL spectra is 0.0411 and 0.4565, respectively (I3a and I3b signify the PL spectrum area of the sample shown in Fig. 3a and b, respectively.) It is apparent that the reduction ratio (I3b/I3a) of green PL was much larger than that of the red one as shown in Fig. 3c. These results demonstrated that the perovskite layer effectively absorbed up-converted light at green wavelengths. It is noteworthy that the up-converted light at red wavelengths was also absorbed by the perovskite, contributing to a partial PCE enhancement of PSCs.
Although the up-converted light was effectively adsorbed by the perovskite layer, it is hard to enhance the PCE notably due to the low quantum yield (∼1%) of light up-conversion from the UCNPs.29,30 Plasmon-enhanced up-converted emission of UCNPs by locating the UCNPs beneath the top Au electrodes of PSCs was exploited to further increase the PCE. To prove the plasmon-enhanced up-converted emission, a 75 nm thick Au film (same thickness of the Au top electrode of PSCs) was deposited on the UCNP-coated glass and PL spectra were recorded for comparison with the reference sample having only UCNPs (Fig. 4a). The Au film-deposited UCNPs on glass showed a higher up-converted photoluminescence (UCPL) compared to that of the bare UCNPs (Fig. 4b), showing a 6.5-fold enhancement (Fig. 4c, the enhancement value was calculated using the ratio of the PL spectrum area of each sample). The Au film-deposited UCNPs could induce strong electromagnetic fields at the sharp Au bottom corners interfacing the UCNPs as shown in the magnified schematic of Fig. 4a,30,39 resulting in plasmon-enhanced emission of UCNPs. Besides, the reflection from the Au layer could partially enhance the UCL of UCNPs by recycling the incident NIR light.30 Therefore, the UCNPs underneath the Au top electrode could emit more NIR-induced up-converted light to the underlying perovskite, leading to an increase in the PCE of PSCs.

The effect of UCNP density on PV performance was firstly investigated using the UCNP solutions at different concentrations (0.01, 0.05, and 0.1 mg ml−1). The UCNPs were transferred on the spiro-OMeTAD layer via the dry transfer method. We found that the highest Jsc and PCE were observed when the 0.05 mg ml−1 UCNP solution was utilized (Fig. S5, ESI†). Furthermore, to clarify the effect of UCNPs’ location, the UCNPs were transferred at different locations within the PSC structure; (i) underneath the Au top electrode, (ii) on the perovskite, and (iii) on the ETL as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The PV characteristics of these three PSCs were measured and compared along with the reference cell without UCNPs. Fig. 5a and b show the statistical PV characteristics, and the representative J–V curves in all cases, respectively. The statistical PV values were from 9 cells in each case and are listed in Table 1. In the case of solar cell (i), all the PV performances including Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE were enhanced compared to the reference cell; particularly, Jsc was enhanced by 3%, leading to 14% enhancement in the PCE. In the case of solar cell (ii), there was no improvement in Jsc compared to the reference cell, however, the PCE was improved by 5%. It is noteworthy that the FF values of solar cell (i) and (ii) were higher than that of the reference, leading to additional PCE enhancement. Plasmon-enhanced upconversion emission of UCNPs can be expected only in solar cell (i). Therefore, the combined effects of plasmonic upconversion emission and NIR utilization of UCNPs maximized the PV performances of PSCs.

Unlike the above two cells, in the case of solar cell (iii), all the averaged PV performances were lower than those of the reference cell. The UCNPs located between the ETL and perovskite induced an adverse effect on the electron transporting from the perovskite layer to the ETL; the insulating UCNPs could generate interfacial resistance. To prove the phenomenon, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured at each Voc of the reference and solar cell (iii) under dark conditions for comparison. Fig. S6 (ESI†) shows the Nyquist plots and the equivalent circuit model. The large half circle in the low-frequency range below 10 kHz (Fig. S6a, ESI†) is associated with the recombination resistance (Rrec), and the small half circle in the high-frequency range above 10 kHz (Fig. S6b, ESI†) is related to the charge transport resistance (Rct) at the interfaces, respectively.40,41 The Rrec and Rct values are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). As expected, the solar cell (iii) had a higher Rct (34.4 Ω) compared to that (19.9 Ω) of the reference. In addition, the Rrec (242 Ω) of solar cell (iii) was lower than that (408 Ω) of the reference cell, leading to a lower Jsc and FF.
4. Conclusions
In this study, up-conversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) were incorporated into PSCs without damaging the underlying perovskite film via the dry transfer method to pursue NIR utilization for PCE enhancement. The UCNPs emitted light at green and red wavelengths when exposed to NIR, which was effectively absorbed by the photo-active perovskite material. In addition, the UCNPs interfacing the Au top electrode emitted more up-converted light due to surface plasmon resonance. The combined effects of the utilization of NIR by UCNPs and surface plasmon resonance phenomenon on the UCNPs could further increase short circuit current density (Jsc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) (13.61% → 15.56%), compared to the reference solar cell without UCNPs. This study indicates that such a dry transfer method can be easily used to incorporate various functional nanoparticles into perovskite-based electronic devices for achieving superior performances.
