    , Accepted 10th March 2019First published on 11th March 2019AbstractThe development of nontoxic and stable all-inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) represents a major challenge to unlock widely practical applications in photoelectric fields. It is an effective strategy to discover nontoxic metal perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with excellent optical properties. In addition, it has been proved that alkali metals such as rubidium (Rb) and potassium (K) have a good influence on improving the optical performance of perovskites. Hence, we reported new lead-free perovskite Rb7Bi3Cl16 single crystals, which displayed a zero-dimensional cluster structure and were composed of two kinds of octahedra with different distortions. At the same time, we synthesized its NCs, which showed a blue emission at 437 nm with a PLQY of 28.43% and presented a good optical and moisture stability for one month. The excellent moisture-stability might be attributed to their much higher ratio of Rb atoms and the ideal [BiCl6]3− octahedra on the surface, which are beneficial to form an inorganic BiOCl shell to protect the Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs from moisture attack.
Introduction
All-inorganic lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs), especially CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I), have attracted worldwide interest due to their high quantum efficiency in optoelectronic devices.1–10 Despite the outstanding advantages of CsPbX3 NCs, the intrinsic toxicity of Pb and the instability towards light and humidity hinder its widely practical applications. Under these circumstances, lead-free perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have been fabricated through nontoxic metal substitution for the purpose of maintaining the excellent optoelectronic performance of lead halide NCs with improved stabilities. The substituted metal ions usually have a similar ns2 electronic configuration to Pb2+ in the outermost orbital, such as Sn2+, Ge2+, Bi3+ and Sb3+.11 Correspondingly, nontoxic metal substitution could be divided into two different substitution methods according to the cation valence state. (1) An equivalent substitution was the first proposed strategy using divalent Sn2+ or Ge2+ to replace Pb2+. CsSnX312 and Cs2SnX613 (X = Cl, Br, I) were two recent examples of tin-based NCs, which revealed rather low photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY < 0.5%) on account of easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ in air and intrinsic defects. (2) A heterovalent substitution was another solution that replaced Pb2+ with other-valence ions (e.g. Bi3+ and Sb3+). For instance, (i) bismuth-based Cs3Bi2X9 NCs14–16 revealed relatively bright blue or violet photoluminescence properties with improved photostability and moisture stability, which is attributed to their further surface modification by BiOBr. (ii) Replacing the Pb2+ cation with a combination of trivalent and monovalent cations leads to the formation of double perovskites, such as Cs2BiAgX6 (X = Cl, Br), which exhibited a visible light absorption with impressive moisture, light and temperature stabilties.17–24 (iii) Antimony-based Cs3Sb2X9 NCs showed a rather high PLQY of 46% but still had a low moisture stability.25 (iv) Palladium-based Cs2PdX6 (X = Br, I) NCs were another example of perovskites that possessed a narrow bandgap (1.69 eV) and an outstanding stability towards light, humidity, and heat.26 It is obvious from these studies that lead-free perovskites showed their future potential in the photoelectrical area; thus, there is still a pressing need for the further exploration of lead-free perovskite NCs with both greater fluorescence performance and better stabilities.
On the other hand, alkali metal cations (e.g. Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+) were considered to have positive effects on the optical, excitonic, and electrical properties of perovskites. It has been demonstrated in a couple of studies that the incorporation of cesium (Cs) and rubidium (Rb) cations could improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE = 21.1–21.6%) and the device stabilities of organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) through suppressing the impurities and retaining a high uniform perovskite thin film.27–30 In addition, alkali-doping in perovskite thin-films and nanocrystals could decrease the surface defects and enhance the photoluminescence properties.31–34 Moreover, Rb3Sb2I9 NCs with better thermal stability and band-edge emissions in the yellow-red region were recently reported, which were considered to be promising candidates for the optoelectronic application.35 To the best of our knowledge, the preparation of perovskite NCs with a single Rb cation and the investigation of their optical properties has been rarely reported.
Hence, for the first time, we synthesized a new lead-free rubidium bismuth chloride single crystal, namely, Rb7Bi3Cl16, by a hydrothermal method. This compound revealed a zero-dimensional (0D) cluster structure with a pretty good thermal stability. In addition, we prepared Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs by an optimized ligand-assisted re-precipitation (LARP) method using gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and a less toxic dispersant (ethanol). The photoluminescence peak of the Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs was located at 437 nm, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 93 nm and a PLQY of 28.43%. Moreover, Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs displayed great optical and moisture stability and could preserve about 70% of their fluorescence after one month of storage.
Experimental
Materials
All reagents were used without any purification. Bismuth(III) chloride (BiCl3, ≥98.0%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China), rubidium chloride (RbCl, 99%, Adamas-beta), hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36–38%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China), gamma-butyrolactone (GBL, 99%, Adamas-beta), n-octylamine (OcAm, 99%, Aladdin), cis-oleic acid (OA, Analytical grade, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China), anhydrous ethanol (EtOH, Analytical grade, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China).
Preparation of Rb7Bi3Cl16 single crystals
The single crystals were synthesized by a traditional hydrothermal method. A mixture of 1.4 mmol RbCl and 0.6 mmol BiCl3 was dissolved in 1 mL HCl solution and then sealed in a 20 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The precursor solution was heated at 160 °C for 24 hours and then slowly cooled to room temperature at a freezing rate of 2 °C per hour. The colorless hexagonal single crystals were obtained after water-rinsing.
Fabrication of Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs
Colloidal Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs were fabricated by a modified ligand-assisted reprecipitation (m-LARP) method14,25,44 0.35 mmol RbCl and 0.15 mmol BiCl3 were dissolved in 10 mL GBL with the addition of 500 μL OA and 60 μL OcAm. The precursor solution was heated for 1 hour at 80 °C for further dissolution. A 0.5 mL precursor solution was slowly injected into 5 mL EtOH under vigorous stirring. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 8 min to discard the large particles and the unreacted substrates. A clear colloidal NCs supernatant was obtained for further characterization.
Structural characterizations
The structure of Rb7Bi3Cl16 single crystals was determined on a Bruker D8 VENTURE CMOS X-ray diffractometer using Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å) at room temperature (CCDC deposition no. 1892178). APEX II software was applied to collect and reduce the data. Semi-empirical absorption corrections based on equivalent reflections were applied for both the data sets using the APEX II program. Both structures were solved by direct methods and refined on F2 by the full-matrix least-squares method using the SHELXTL-2016 software package.36,37 During this process, the Rb4, Rb5 and Cl4–Cl7 atoms in [Bi2Cl10]4− octahedra, were disordered, hence, their occupancies were reduced to 1/3 of their original values. The structure was also checked for possible missing symmetry with PLATON. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data were collected on a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) in the 2θ angular range of 5–50° with a scan step width of 0.02°. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments were carried out on a TGA/1100SF instrument at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured on a Kratos Axis Supra DLD spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hv = 1486.6 eV).
Optical characterizations
The optical diffuse reflectance spectrum of Rb7Bi3Cl16 single crystals was measured at room temperature with a UV-3600 Plus UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer while BaSO4 was used as the standard (100% reflectance). The reflectance spectrum was converted into an absorbance spectrum based on the Kubelka–Munk function.43 The absorption spectrum was measured on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (TU-1950, PERSEE, China). The PL measurements of Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs were carried out using a Fluorescence Lifetime Spectrometer (PTI, USA), which was equipped with a 500 W xenon lamp. The time-resolved PL spectra were obtained on a Life Spec II (Edinburgh Instrument) using the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) method with the excitation wavelength of 375 nm.
Results and discussion
To investigate the relationship between the crystal structure and optical properties, we first synthesized Rb7Bi3Cl16 single crystals that were grown by a hydrothermal method. The precursor solution was a stoichiometric combination of rubidium chloride (RbCl) and bismuth chloride (BiCl3) that were dissolved in hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 160 °C for 24 hours. Then colorless single crystals with a maximum size of 18.4 mm × 7.2 mm × 6.0 mm were successfully obtained. The single crystals were crystallized in the trigonal space group P1c (no. 163 space group) with lattice parameters a = 7.5561 Å, b = 7.5561 Å, c = 34.3002 Å, α = β = 90°, γ = 120° (Table S1†). As shown in Fig. 1b, Rb7Bi3Cl16 single crystals’ asymmetric unit contains two Bi atoms (Bi1 and Bi2), five Rb atoms (Rb1–Rb5) and seven Cl atoms (Cl1–Cl7), in which Bi1 and Bi2 atoms are located on the mirror planes and the crystallographic 3-fold axis, respectively. Each Bi atom is coordinated with six adjacent Cl atoms forming discrete [BiCl6]3− octahedra or [Bi2Cl10]4− edge-sharing dimers, while Rb atoms are filled in the space for the valence balance. Viewing down the b axis, it seems to be a sandwich-like structure where every four [BiCl6]3− octahedra and a [Bi2Cl10]4− dimer are packed up layer by layer. The octahedral distortions (Δd) were calculated to investigate the distinct structure of Rb7Bi3Cl16.38 As a result, we discovered two kinds of octahedra with different Δd, namely, [Bi(1)Cl6]3− octahedra and [Bi(2)2Cl10]4− dimers (Table S2†), which were different from other bismuth-based perovskites like Cs3Bi2Cl9 (1D), Cs3Bi2Br9 (1D), Cs3Bi2I9 (0D), and Rb3Bi2I9 (2D).38–42 The [Bi(1)Cl6]3− octahedra, without any distortion (Δd1 = 0), are located on the lattice surface. In the interior, the [Bi(2)2Cl10]4− dimers are observed with larger distortions with Δd2 = 0.84. The edge-shared chlorine atoms of the [Bi(2)2Cl10]4− dimers have longer Bi–Cl distances (in the range of 2.903–2.908 Å) than those of the terminal chlorine atoms whose bond distances (2.560–2.717 Å) are nearer to the sum of the covalent radii of Bi and Cl, which are comparable with those of previous Bi–Cl compounds.41,42
 Fig. 1  The crystal structure of Rb7Bi3Cl16 single crystals: (a) unit cell (pink octahedra represented the [Bi(1)Cl6]3− octahedra, blue edge-sharing dimers represented the [Bi(2)2Cl10]4−), (b) asymmetric unit. (c) Unit cell of Cs3Bi2Br9 (blue octahedra represented the [Bi(1)Cl6]3− octahedra) and (d) unit cell of Cs3Bi2Cl9 (pink and yellow octahedra represented the [Bi(1)Cl6]3− octahedra and [Bi(2)Cl6]3− octahedra, respectively). 
Subsequently, we compared Rb7Bi3Cl16 to other bismuth halide perovskites, like Cs3Bi2Br9 (Fig. 1c) and Cs3Bi2Cl9 (Fig. 1d) in aspects of the alkali/Bi ratio and structure. Clearly, Rb7Bi3Cl16 has a higher alkali/Bi ratio of 2.33 compared to that of Cs3Bi2Cl9 and Cs3Bi2Br9 (alkali/Bi = 1.5), suggesting a Rb-rich surface for Rb7Bi3Cl16. On another note, Rb7Bi3Cl16 reveals a zero-dimensional structure with two kinds of octahedra while both Cs3Bi2Cl9 and Cs3Bi2Br9 demonstrate one-dimensional structures with corner-sharing octahedra. In addition, there are more [Bi(1)Cl6]3− octahedra on the surface of the unit cell compared with those of Cs3Bi2Cl9 and Cs3Bi2Br9. This higher proportion of Rb atom and more [Bi(1)Cl6]3− octahedra on the surface of Rb7Bi3Cl16 might have a beneficial impact on its moisture stability due to the following factors: (1) Higher Rb/Bi ratio of Rb7Bi3Cl16 gives a surface passivation towards moisture. (2) More [Bi(1)Cl6]3− octahedra on the surface can act as sacrificial agents, which quickly turn into BiOCl under moisture attacks and form a stable BiOCl shell.
The simulated and experimental PXRD patterns of Rb7Bi3Cl16 single crystals are shown in Fig. S1;† the diffraction peaks in the simulated pattern were in accordance with that of the experimental pattern, and the difference in the intensity may be the result of the preferred orientation of the powder samples, indicating the phase purity of the products.
Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed under nitrogen flow from 30 to 800 °C to study the thermal stability of Rb7Bi3Cl16 single crystals. As demonstrated in Fig. 2a, Rb7Bi3Cl16 single crystals were stable below 400 °C. The first weight loss (11.66%) started at around 400 °C, which was consistent with the theoretical calculation of weight loss (11.73%) that is related to the partial removal of BiCl3 from the [Bi(1)Cl6]3− octahedra. And the second weight loss happened at about 590 °C, which was a continued removal of BiCl3. Clearly, Rb7Bi3Cl16 exhibited a good thermal-stability.

The UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectrum for Rb7Bi3Cl16 single crystals was displayed in Fig. 2b. The transmittance was above 92% in the range from 400 to 1000 nm and no obvious absorption peak was observed in the range of 1.24–3.10 eV. The absorption spectra were calculated according to the Kubelka–Munk function (1): α/S = (1 − R)2/2R(1)where α was the absorption coefficient, S was the scattering coefficient and R was the reflectance.43 The optical band gap for Rb7Bi3Cl16 might be 3.27 eV with a cut-off edge of around 400 nm, indicating that it is a wide band-gap semiconductor.
Rb7Bi3Cl16 nanocrystals (NCs) were fabricated by a slightly modified LARP method.14,25,44 RbCl and BiCl3 were dissolved in the GBL solution while adding certain amounts of oleic acid (OA) and n-octylamine (OcAm) as capping agents. Then, the precursor solution was added into ethanol under vigorous stirring to form a well-dispersed colloidal NCs solution. Notably, GBL was found to be a better precursor solvent compared with dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO). Based on previous reports, strong coordinating solvents (e.g. DMSO and DMF) were more likely to form defective perovskite NCs with residual solvent molecules on the surface, which accounted for the fast degradation and precipitation.45 On the contrary, GBL exhibited a weak-coordination ability towards Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs, leading to a better colloidal stability. Unlike the lead-based perovskite NCs, Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs have an excellent alcohol-tolerance and exhibited better fluorescence properties when dispersed in ethanol. Besides, ethanol exhibits the ideal intersolubility and lower toxicity compared to toluene and dichloromethane, which make ethanol an excellent choice for colloid Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs. During the systematic optimization of the synthesis process, we found that different reaction temperatures had obvious effects on the fluorescence performances. It should be noted that the higher the reaction temperature, the more the amount of reactants dissolved and larger the red-shifts presented in the PL spectra (Fig. S3†). The reaction temperature could not only promote the dissolution and the reaction, but also cause the aggregation of NCs during the heating process. Taking account of the optimization results, we believed that 80 °C was the proper reaction temperature and continued to study the optical properties of Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs.
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs is presented in Fig. 3a. The as-synthesized NCs exhibited quasi-spherical shapes with an average diameter of 1.85 nm. In more detail, the size distribution (±0.8 nm), obtained from different regions of the sample, was consistent with normal distribution. It is worth mentioning that Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs maintained much smaller diameters than those of other previously reported bismuth halide NCs (around 3–5 nm).14,15,22,46 One reasonable explanation for the smaller sizes of Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs was the lattice contraction of these NCs due to the smaller atomic radii of Rb and Cl in comparison with Cs and Br. Besides, RbCl showed poorer solubility in polar solvents than CsCl; thus, the precursor was prone to form a supersaturated solution, which leads to a rapid crystal nucleation and smaller sizes of NCs during the preparation period.

The PXRD patterns in Fig. 3b confirmed the successful fabrication of Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs as the patterns were in good agreement with the calculated results based on the single crystals. However, we also discovered a few additional diffraction peaks at 2θ = 21.9°, 32.3° and 33.7°, which might have originated from the impurity phases of BiCl3 or other unknown bismuth chlorides because of the excess reactants.
Moreover, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were used to analyze the surface elemental composition and the valence state of Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs, as shown in Fig. S6.† The Bi 4f spectrum presented two contributions, 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, located at 159.5 and 164.8 eV, respectively, which were similar to the XPS results of bismuth chloride and bismuth oxychloride. The Rb/Bi ratio of Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs was about 2.1, which was in approximate agreement with the chemical formula of Rb7Bi3Cl16 (Table S4†).
The absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the colloidal solution were measured under ambient conditions, for exploring the optical properties of such highly crystalline Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs (Fig. 3c and Fig. S4†). Owing to the quantum confinement,15 the UV-vis absorption spectrum of Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs had a band edge at around 385 nm, smaller than that of the single crystal Rb7Bi3Cl16. At the same time, a broad emission peak at 437 nm was observed by exciting at a wavelength of 365 nm, accompanied with a blue-shift of 20 nm compared to that of the Rb7Bi3Cl16 single crystals in the PL spectrum. The sample had a relatively larger Stokes shift of 72 nm than that of the traditional CsPbBr3 NCs, implying that the PL emission of NCs might not only originate from direct exciton recombination.44 In addition, the peak width in the PL spectrum was fairly broader with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 93 nm. Wondering the origin of large FWHM, we measured the PL spectra at different control conditions for further investigation. According to Fig. S5,† the emission can be mainly assigned to the intrinsic luminescence of Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs. Besides, the broad PL emission was comparable with that of the reported bismuth halide perovskite NCs, which came from surface defects and strong exciton–phonon coupling.39 The large FWHM of Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs might suggest the recombination of these self-trapped excitons similar to other bismuth halide perovskite NCs.47,48 In order to gain further information about the exciton recombination dynamics, time-resolved PL spectra were measured and have shown a tri-exponential function trace including a short-lived lifetime τ1 = 1.63 ns (18.22%), a medium-lived lifetime τ2 = 4.96 ns (72.34%) and a long-lived lifetime τ3 = 13.63 ns (9.44%). And Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs had a longer average lifetime (τaver = 5.17 ns) compared to Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs (τaver ≈ 2.09 ns). Based on the previous reports, τ1, τ2, and τ3 were assigned to three different decay processes, which were carrier trapping, intrinsic electron–hole radiative recombination and trap-state related recombination, respectively.22,23,26,49–51 The Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs showed the highest ratio of radiative recombination and partial trap-related recombination. Therefore, the fluorescence of Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs was mostly derived from the intrinsic carrier radiative recombination and was limited by the presence of non-radiative defects.
The relative photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the diluted sample was calculated using the following equation:14 Φf1/Φf2 = F1/F2 × A2/A1 × (n1/n2)2(2)where Φf2 was the quantum yield of the standard sample, F was the integrated area, A was the absorbance of the solution and n was the average refractive index of the solutions. In detail, the fresh Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs solution was diluted with absolute ethanol in order to minimize re-absorption/self-quenching effects. Meanwhile, the absorbance was generally controlled below 0.1 at the excitation wavelength. Quinine sulfate (0.1 mol L−1 H2SO4 solution) was referred to be a standard under 365 nm excitation (PLQY = 57.7%). Besides, refractive indices of 0.1 mol L−1 H2SO4 solution and absolute ethanol at room temperature were 1.3443 and 1.096, respectively. The PLQYs of 13.41–28.43% were recorded for the different batches of Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs samples, which were higher than that of the all-inorganic CsPbCl3 perovskite NCs with a similar emission peak wavelength of 410 nm and a PLQY of 10%.14
Moreover, we studied the photo-stabilities of Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs by illuminating the NCs solution from a distance of 10 cm using a UV lamp (365 nm, 5 W). The sample solution exhibited an obvious photo-activation in the first four hours, followed by a 20% reduction in the PL intensity after 12 h of illumination. The phenomenon of photo-activation was also found in the similar Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs,14 with a reasonable explanation. That it, photo-activation might arise from the smoothing of the NCs and the elimination of dangling bonds or other surface defects.
In addition, the moisture stability was investigated by adding 2 mL deionized water into 4 mL NCs solution and recording its real-time PL intensity. A small amount of white deposits was slowly generated in the clear NCs solution while the PL intensity of Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs was dropping from 100% to 82.69% in the first four hours (Fig. 4b). After that, the decline of the PL intensity of Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs greatly slowed down. Furthermore, the white deposits were characterized by XRD (Fig. S8†) to gain more insight into the degradation process. The observed diffraction peaks correspond to BiOCl (JCPDS: 06-0249), suggesting that Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs would decompose into BiOCl under moisture. Moreover, instead of complete decomposition into BiOCl, Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs preserved around 70% of their PL intensity after a month of storage with only a fraction of BiOCl deposits.

From the above stability tests, the long-term luminescence performance of Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs was better in comparison to those of the oxidation sensitive CsSnX3 NCs and moisture sensitive CsPbX3 NCs. More importantly, we compared Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs with the reported Bi-based NCs in terms of PL property and stabilities (Table S5†). It is obvious that Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs reveal pretty competitive thermal and moisture stability. As mentioned above, this excellent stability might be attributed to its inorganic nature and its unique crystal structure. Firstly, the higher Rb/Bi ratio of Rb7Bi3Cl16 provides surface passivation towards moisture. Secondly, H2O molecules might be prone to interact with the ideal [Bi(1)Cl6] octahedra on the surface of Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs, leading to a fast formation of BiOCl shell, which corresponds to the initial decline in the PL intensity in the first four hours. As illustrated in Scheme 1, the surface of Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs was covered by such a stable BiOCl shell, which substantially slowed down the further degradation of the NCs.52

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized a new kind of lead-free perovskite single crystal Rb7Bi3Cl16 and its NCs. Rb7Bi3Cl16 single crystals display a unique discrete structure and have high thermal stability. On the other hand, Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs have a small size with an average diameter of 1.85 ± 0.8 nm, and were synthesized by a modified LARP method using ethanol as the dispersant. The bright blue emission of Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs was at 437 nm with a PLQY of 28.43%. Moreover, Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs maintained high thermal stability, excellent photostability and moisture stability, which are mainly derived from the BiOCl shell on the surface of the NCs and the higher Rb/Bi ratio of Rb7Bi3Cl16 giving surface passivation towards moisture. Therefore, this lead-free perovskite Rb7Bi3Cl16 NCs might have potential applications in various optoelectronic realms, especially in fluorescence detection and bio-imaging due to their excellent optical performance, low-toxicity and ultrahigh stability.
