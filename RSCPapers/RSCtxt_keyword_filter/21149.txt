    AbstractThe present work demonstrates the usefulness of the soft-template directed approach in preparing mesoporous titanium dioxide and applying it in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Mesoporous titanium dioxide with nanograins of dimension in the range, 16–20 nm were prepared through the soft-templating approach using various cationic surfactants such as octyl-, dodecyl-, cetyl trimethylammonium bromide with different surfactant compositions and titania precursor concentrations. As-synthesized mesoporous titanium dioxide samples were characterized by TGA, PXRD, FESEM, HRTEM and surface area measurements, used as photo-electrode material in DSSCs. Under global AM 1.5 solar irradiation, the best photovoltaic performance of 7.5% with a short circuit photocurrent density of 14.2 mA/cm−2, an open circuit voltage of 748 mV, and a fill factor of 70.83% were obtained for the DSSC using a film of mesoporous TiO2 synthesized from the cetyl trimethylammoniumbromide surfactant. In contrast, the use of commercial titania powder P25 resulted in an efficiency of 5.0% under similar conditions. The structural and morphological merits of these template-directed materials will be especially addressed in comparison with their traditional bulk forms.

Broader context
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) also referred to as Grätzel cells, after the inventors Brian O Regan and Michael Grätzel, are promising low-cost photovoltaic devices. Efficiencies over 11% have been achieved using liquid electrolytes containing the iodide/tri-iodide red-ox couple. Mesostructured TiO2 with higher surface area and optimal porosity are critical for achieving higher efficiency. The mesoporous structure of the TiO2 electrodes for DSSCs is capable of providing an increased cross section for surface-anchored light harvesters allowing greater light absorption. During the past decade, new synthetic strategies have been developed in designing mesoporous architectures of TiO2 for several applications including DSSCs. This paper discusses the simple surfactant mediated strategy for the synthesis of mesoporous titania using various cationic surfactants under optimized conditions and their characterization, and application as photoelectrodes for DSSCs. The structural merits of the synthesized mesoporous titania are highlighted in terms of photovoltaic performance.

Introduction
Currently many research groups are focusing on the development of photovoltaic devices as an alternative to non-renewable power sources to meet rapidly increasing global energy demands as well as climate change mitigation. As an alternative to conventional silicon based photovoltaic devices, nanostructured solar cells such as dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and organic solar cells based on polymers, are attracting great attention because of their potential for low cost and easy manufacturing.1–3,5 In this context, dye-sensitized nanocystalline solar cells remain the most promising alternative to conventional solar cells as these cells have the potential to deliver short energy pay back time at a low cost.4–6 In the past decade, the objective of numerous investigations has been to achieve highly efficient photovoltaic conversion by DSSCs, fortunately an impressive power conversion efficiency of over 11% has been obtained so far.6 It is well known that the DSSC device has four important components namely, a) the mesoporous nanocrystalline titanium dioxide film electrode deposited on a transparent conducting oxide, b) the monolayer of dye adsorbed onto the TiO2, c) a platinum counter electrode, and d) an electrolyte solution with a dissolved iodide/tri-iodide (I−/I3−) redox couple in between the electrodes. It is obvious that there are a number of factors determining the overall conversion efficiency but the structural and physical properties of the mesoporous nanocrystalline titanium dioxide (meso-TiO2) film used in DSSCs are clearly among the important ones.7,8 The mesostructure within the meso-TiO2 offers a large internal surface area, which allows more dye adsorption and hence, more efficient light absorption compared to bulk TiO2. Furthermore, these porous films with interconnected grains facilitate rapid electron transport within the TiO2 film and highly efficient charge transfer at interfaces of film/dye/electrolyte.9 Hence, meso-TiO2 is essential for DSSCs with high performance. As a result, many laboratories around the world have been actively studying the synthesis of nanocrystalline titanium dioxide with ordered mesostructures.
Generally, meso-TiO2 has been synthesized by various methods such as sol–gel,10 precipitation11 and the template directed approach. Template-directed materials generally possess structural and morphological abundance due to the diversity of employed template precursors.12,13 Nano- or micron-scaled electrode materials with different morphologies such as one-dimensional (1D) wire/tube structures, 2D films, and 3D interconnected porous architectures can easily be obtained through the template synthesis method.14 The template-synthesized materials normally exhibit small crystallite size, high surface area, large surface-to-volume ratio, and favorable structural stability. Surfactants have been employed as structure directing agents to produce a variety of meso-TiO2 materials. The first synthesis of a thermally stable hexagonally packed meso-TiO2 by a modified sol–gel method using an alkyl phosphate surfactant, was carried out by Antonelli and Ying in 1995.15 Kobayashi and collaborators prepared a fibrous TiO2 material with “macaroni”- like structure by using their designed amphiphilic compound containing cationic charge moieties.16 Kavan et al. used a polymeric surfactant, poly (alkaline oxide) block copolymer, as templating agent for the formation of anatase TiO2 and investigated essentially Li+ insertion.17 Yang and co-workers used amphiphilic poly (alkaline oxide) block copolymers as structure-directing agents in non-aqueous solutions for organizing the network forming metal oxide species that include TiO2.18 Byun et al. elucidated the beneficial role of cetyl trimethylammoniumbromide as surfactant in the enhancement of photovoltaic properties of mesoporous rutile TiO2.19 Elder et al. synthesized and characterized zirconia-stabilized 2.5 nm TiO2 anatase crystallites in a mesoporous structure templated by cetyltrimethylammonium chloride.20 The surfactant assisted templating method was used to fabricate high quality titania nanocrystals by various researchers for different applications including dye-sensitized solar cells.21–25 Recently, Falaras et al. synthesized mesoporous titania nanocrystals using hexa decylamine as the template and studied its application in dye-sensitized solar cells.26 Sol–gel methods have often been used to prepare sub-micrometre-sized TiO2 spheres by controlling the hydrolysis and condensation reactions, and their crystallized structure was formed by subsequent calcination at around 500 °C.10 Mono-dispersed spherical TiO2 structure can be successfully obtained by this procedure, but their low surface area and poor porous structure limit their application to DSSCs.
In the current work, a simple and inexpensive soft-template methodology was developed using aqueous-based, mild-reaction conditions. This method was used to obtain crystallized mesoporous TiO2 with a high surface area and well-developed pore structure. As can be seen from the above references, no attempt has been made so far to study systematically the effect of changing the chain length of the surfactant (cationic), and the titania precursor concentration with respect to that of the surfactant on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells. This being the situation, we have chosen the most typical cationic surfactants octyl trimethylammoniumbromide, dodecyl trimethylammonium bromide, and cetyl trimethylammoniumbromide, (increasing chain length of the surfactant: C8, C12 and C16) aiming at improving the surface area of the meso-TiO2 film and thereby inducing high light absorption which in turn can fulfil the requirements of a DSSC for obtaining high cell efficiency.
Experimental
Materials
All the chemicals were used as received without further purification. Absolute ethanol (99.99%) was obtained from Merck Chemicals Ltd. Titanium isopropoxide (98%), α-terpineol, t-butyl pyridine (96%), Iodine (≥99.5%), lithium iodide (99.9%) and acetonitrile (99.8%) were purchased from Aldrich. Octyl trimethylammonium bromide, dodecyl trimethylammoniumbromide, cetyl trimethylammoniumbromide and sodium hydroxide were purchased from Alfa Aesar (99%). Ethyl cellulose was obtained from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co. Ltd, Japan. 1- propyl-2, 3 dimethyl-imidazolium iodide and N3 dye were obtained from Solaronix, SA. P25 a commercial titania powder with a grain size of 25 nm was received from JJ-Degussa Chemicals (S) Pte Ltd and used for comparison study in the present investigation.
Synthesis of mesoporous TiO2
Titanium isopropoxide was used as titania source. Octyl trimethylammoniumbromide (OTAB), dodecyl trimethylammoniumbromide (DOTAB), cetyl trimethylammoniumbromide (CTAB) were used as structure directing agents. Absolute ethanol and highly purified distilled water were used in the synthesis of all the samples. Different molar ratios of surfactant (SC) to titanium isopropoxide (TIPR) were used for CTAB as template, in order to optimize the device performance. The similar optimization study was carried out for other two cationic surfactants namely, OTAB and DOTAB as templates. As a representative synthesis methodology, the case of CTAB templated mesoporous TiO2 (under SC/TIPR = 1/1) is described here. A definite weight of the cationic surfactant CTAB was taken (3.64 g) in a round bottomed flask, and dissolved in a mixture of water and absolute ethanol in a volume ratio of 4/1 (100 mL of distilled water and 25 mL of absolute ethanol), and stirred for 30 min to form a clear solution. To this solution, calculated amount (2.87 mL) of titanium isopropoxide (for CTAB/TIPR molar ratio = 1/1) was added drop wise with continuous vigorous stirring. The resulting gel was further stirred for 24 h and the precipitate was filtered, washed several times with ethanol. The final product was calcined at 450 °C (at 5 °C min−1) for 6 h in static air to remove the organic template and to increase cross-linking of the inorganic frame work. A similar procedure was followed for the synthesis of other samples (see Table 1) with different ratios of CTAB and TIPR, as well as for DOTAB and OTAB templated mesoporous TiO2 (see also Table S1; ESI†).

Characterization of the meso-TiO2 nanocrystals
Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on both as-synthesized and calcined meso-TiO2 samples to ascertain the complete removal of surfactant and organic precursors from the weight loss observed as a function of the temperature. TGA was performed using Labsys Evo, TGA-DSC-1600 (Setaram instruments). As-synthesized and calcined titania powder were placed in an alumina crucible and heated under argon atmosphere at a rate of 10 °C min−1 from ambient temperature to 600 °C. The crystallinity, phase purity and particle size of the synthesized meso-TiO2 were examined by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The PXRD patterns were recorded at room temperature on a diffractometer (D5005 Bruker) using Cu-Kα1 radiation with wavelength of 1.54056 Å. The diffractometer was set at 40 kV accelerating voltage and 40 mA current. The data were collected by varying 2θ from 10° to 70° with an increment of 0.015°/s.
FESEM (Jeol JSM-7000F) was used to study the morphology of the meso-TiO2 as well as the films made using them. For the FESEM analysis, the sample was sputtered with a thin layer of platinum (JFC-1600 Auto Fine Coater) to avoid the charging effect. The thickness of the titania films after sintering was measured using a surface profiler (KLA-Tencor P10) and found to be about 29 μm.
A JEOL JEM-2010 instrument was used to obtain the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of the samples and also the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) of meso-TiO2. For these experiments, the meso-TiO2 was subjected to ultrasonification in ethanol medium to disperse the fine powder onto the copper grids. These TEM images were used to investigate the morphology while the SAED confirmed the nature of crystallinity. The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of the meso-TiO2 were obtained by using Nova 1200, Quantachrome at 77 K. Pre-treatments of the samples were carried out at 423 K for 12 h under high vacuum.
Fabrication of DSSC
The viscous paste was made by mixing meso-TiO2 with ethyl cellulose as binder and α-terpineol as the solvent. Conducting glass plates (2.2 × 1.6 × 1.1 cm3; AGC Fabritech Co. Ltd, Japan; F-doped SnO2 over layer, 80% transmission in visible, 10–20% haze, and sheet resistance 13–15 Ω/cm2) were used as the substrate for depositing the TiO2 film. To mask electrical contact strips, 0.5 cm width of the conducting glass plate was covered along the length of each edge with adhesive scotch tape. The viscous TiO2 paste was then spread uniformly by doctor blade technique on the surface of the glass. After removing the adhesive tapes, the assemblage was heated in air for 30 min at 500 °C and was then allowed to cool. To obtain a thicker film for more light absorption, the above procedure was repeated once again. The resulting cell area was (0.8 × 0.5) 0.4 cm2. The TiO2 electrodes were then coated with the dye molecules by soaking them for 15 h in 0.3 mM cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II) dye ([RuL2 (NCS) 2]·2H2O), known as N3, in absolute ethanol at room temperature. The counter electrodes were prepared by sputtering platinum on FTO glass substrates using JFC-1600 Auto Fine Coater. The platinum electrode and the dye loaded TiO2 electrode were clamped firmly together using binder clips. A polyethylene spacer was used as a film to prevent the cell from short-circuiting. A small quantity of redox electrolyte solution was then introduced into the porous structure of the TiO2 film by capillary action. The electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M 1-propyl-2,3 dimethyl-imidazolium iodide (DMPImI), 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.5 M t-butyl pyridine, and 0.05 M iodine dissolved in acetonitrile.
To determine the amount of N3 dye molecules adsorbed on TiO2 films, adsorption–desorption experiments were carried out using Shimadzu, UV-1800 spectrophotometer. The dye molecules were desorbed by immersing the TiO2 electrodes into 0.1M NaOH solution of ethanol–H2O (1:1, v/v). The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the resultant solution was measured and the absorption value at 518 nm was used to calculate the number of adsorbed dye molecules on TiO2 films using Beer's law.
Photovoltaic characterization
The dye loaded TiO2 film was illuminated through the transparent conducting glass substrate by an AM1.5 solar simulator (Newport Inst., Model #:91160A) with a 150W Xe lamp and an AM filter (#: 81088A) as a light source. The photo electrochemical performance of the solar cells was measured at 25 °C with a source meter (Keithely 2420) and using Newport IV test station software. The light intensity corresponding to AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell (Oriel, SRC-1000-TC). The photoelectric conversion efficiency was calculated by the following formula: (1)where, VOC is the open circuit-voltage, JSC is the short-circuit current density, FF is the fill factor and Pin is the incident power.
Results and discussion
Thermal and structural characterization

Fig. 1 shows the thermograms of as-synthesized and calcined sample C5 (see Table 1). It can be seen from Fig. 1(a) that the weight loss for as-synthesized titania powder occurs in two stages as the temperature was increased up to 450 °C. The major weight loss below 200 °C is attributed to the removal of water molecules. The decomposition of the organic residues of surfactant and crystallization of anatase titania structure occurs between 200 to 450 °C. The titania powder calcined at 450 °C undergoes negligible weight loss as shown in Fig. 1(b), thus confirming that the calcination process has completely removed the organic agents and surfactants that were employed during the synthesis.

Fig. 2 shows the PXRD pattern of the P25, as-synthesized and calcined meso-TiO2 samples using various surfactants (OTAB, DOTAB and CTAB). The as-synthesized TiO2 powder shows a broad peak intensity of around 25.3° (Fig. 2a), indicating that it crystallizes in anatase phase. After the heat treatment, the peaks become strong and sharp as noticed in Fig. 2(b–d). PXRD patterns of the meso-TiO2 powder shows strong diffraction peaks around (2θ) 25°, 38°, 48°, and 55° which are characteristic of anatase-type TiO2 (JCPDS 21-1272) and the XRD patterns also clearly reveal that other phases such as rutile and brookite are absent. On the other hand, the XRD spectrum of P25 shows presence of both anatase and rutile phases (Fig. 2e). The crystallite size of mesoprous titania was estimated from line broadening of the [101] diffraction peak using Debye-Scherrer's equation: (2)where, λ is equal to 1.54056 Å, the wavelength for Cu-Kα1 radiation, B is the width of the peak at an intensity equal to half the maximum intensity in radians, and θ is the diffracted angle at maximum intensity and the grain size was found to be in the range of 16–20 nm.

Fig. 3 depicts the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm and pore size distribution of calcined meso-TiO2, C5. The isotherm exhibits typical type IV pattern with hysteresis loop, a typical characteristic of mesoporous materials according to the classification of IUPAC.25 A sharp increase in adsorption volume of N2 was observed between 0.5–0.7 of relative partial pressure. This sharp increase can be attributed to the capillary condensation, indicating a good homogeneity of the sample. The BJH pore size distribution obtained from the desorption branch of the isotherms appears to be narrow (see inset of Fig. 3). The surface area, the total pore volume and the pore size of meso-TiO2 samples were calculated using Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method. The surface areas of O5, D5 and C5 are found to be 90, 109 and 135 m2/g respectively. It can be noted that the surface area of meso-TiO2 is two to three times higher than that of P25 powder (50 m2/g) and certainly among the highest found in the literature for titania powder after calcination.27 It is noticeable that although all the mesoporous titania synthesized using various surfactants exhibit similar nitrogen sorption isotherms (Fig S2 & S3; ESI†), the capillary condensation step (of the adsorption isotherm) shifts to higher partial pressure for materials prepared from longer chain surfactants and this shift implies an increase of pore size with increase in the chain length of the surfactant from OTAB to DOTAB to CTAB. The corresponding mean pore sizes are 5.7 nm, 6.1 nm and 7.0 nm respectively for the samples O5, D5 and C5. Thus, as the surfactant chain length increases the surface area, pore size and the pore volume increases. The results of nitrogen adsorption/desorption experiments indicate that the nanostructured titanium dioxide prepared by this soft-template method has large specific surface area with mesoporous structure. The mechanism of formation of these mesoporous TiO2 is explained in the following paragraph.
 Fig. 3  N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms measured for sample C5 with corresponding BJH pore size distribution as an inset. 
Two mechanisms have been proposed so far to interpret the formation of mesoporous materials by template method. One is liquid crystal mechanism,28 and another is co-operative mechanism.29 The liquid crystal mechanism in which surfactant liquid crystal structures serve as organic templates has been proposed for the formation of ordered mesoporous materials at high surfactant concentration while the co-operative mechanism explains the formation of mesoporous materials at low concentration of the surfactant. In the present experiment, the concentration of surfactant being low (0.01M), we consider the co-operative mechanism to understand for the formation of mesoporous titania. The surfactant molecules used in the present study consists of a large polar head and a small chain forming shape similar to a cone. In an aqueous media these chains tend to self-associate to form a spherical aggregate called a normal micelle, in which the chains form the inner core and the head groups the outer surface. At low surfactant concentration the normal micelle is spherical, with a diameter fixed by the length of the hydrocarbon chain and the size of the polar head. Finally, the formation of the mesoporous titania begins with ion-exchange which facilitates the assembly of titania-surfactant micelles (TSMs) formed between titanates and polar head groups of surfactant at definite concentration of reactants leading to spherical TSMs at nano-size.30
In order to understand the morphological features of the template synthesized meso-TiO2, calcined powders were analyzed using FESEM. Fig. 4 shows the scanning electron micrographs of the meso-TiO2 (C5) powder and the film made from it. As represented in Fig.4a, meso-TiO2 is made of large irregular shaped particles formed due to aggregation of several spherical nanograins. The surface of film exhibits a porous structure (Fig. 4b). It may be realized that further heat treatment of the film at 500 °C for 30 min results in improving inter-particle contacts thereby enhancing the transport of photogenerated electrons to FTO contact surface and favoring a firm contact between TiO2 film and the FTO substrate.
 Fig. 4  FESEM images of meso-TiO2 (C5): (a) powder and (b) porous film sintered at 500 °C. 
Transmission electron micrographs (TEM) of meso-TiO2 powder (C5) calcined at 450 °C is shown in Fig. 5(a–c). Well dispersed nanosized grains are found due to ultrasonic treatment in contrast to the aggregation of nanograins observed in FESEM image. It can be seen from TEM image that the meso-TiO2 grains have a uniform size of about 16–20 nm, which is consistent with that calculated from the PXRD data. The similar sizes of the nanograins could be attributed to the fact that the three surfactants differ from each other by only four carbon atoms (alkyl groups). The difference between the lengths of the surfactants C8, C12 and C16 is around 0.5 nm–1.5 nm. The length of the surfactant molecules in a way decides the size of the core of the micelles formed. The process conditions were controlled so that the organic micelle formation as well as a good interaction between the inorganic titania source and the organic template is ensured in order to form an organized TSM's network. Once the network is formed, the product was subjected to calcination process under similar conditions which might cause the shrinkage of the grains in different proportion, resulting in an average grain size of 16–20 nm for all meso-TiO2 investigated in this study.
 Fig. 5  (a) TEM, (b) HRTEM and (c) SAED images of meso-TiO2 (C5). 
The HRTEM image recorded on the meso–TiO2 provides an insight into the microstructures of these materials as shown in the Fig. 5(b). The meso-TiO2 was composed of many randomly oriented ∼16–20 nm crystallites with clear lattice fringes. The observed lattice fringes clearly indicate that the as-synthesized mesoporous TiO2 samples are highly crystalline in nature. The observed width of 3.490 ± 5 Å between neighboring lattice fringes corresponds to the (101) plane of anatase TiO2. The fine crystallinity of the as-prepared meso–TiO2 samples were recognized from this image. Fig. 5(c) shows the selected area electron diffraction pattern of the meso-TiO2 sample, where polycrystalline diffraction rings (101), (004), (200) and (105) of anatase TiO2 are clearly observed and they are consistent with PXRD pattern results shown in Fig. 2. PXRD, HRTEM and SAED results confirm that these meso-TiO2 are indeed in pure anatase phase. These results strongly suggest that the soft template method employed in the present work to synthesize meso-TiO2 can be a simple, convenient and a potential process for the bulk production of highly crystalline meso-TiO2, a key requirement for industry applications.
Photovoltaic studies

Fig. 6 presents the photovoltaic performances of the DSSC made using mesoporous TiO2 synthesized from CTAB template with different concentrations of surfactant and the titanium precursor. From Table 2, it is evident that the concentration of titanium precursor source has significant influence on the device performance. An increase is observed in the values of Jsc,Voc, F.F. and consequently overall conversion efficiency, as the molar ratio of SC/TIPR decreases. As the concentration of titania precursor increases the titania particle density per unit surface area of the surfactant and this results in an improved inter-grain connectivity which might allow ease of charge carrier transport. In addition, as we increase the titania concentration, a greater number of the TiO2 grains are available for adsorption of more dye molecules as confirmed from the dye desorption experiments (Table 2) there by resulting in the generation of a high photocurrent. The highest value of 14.2 mA/cm2 was observed for the cells made from C5 (SC/TIPR = 1/5). Beyond this molar ratio, the efficiency slightly drops or almost remains constant. This shows that the increase of concentration of titania precursor beyond five times the concentration of surfactant does not have any significant effect on the micro-structure of meso-TiO2 and hence on the device performance. We have also carried out similar optimization with the other two surfactants (DOTAB and OTAB). A similar effect has been observed i.e. the increase of concentration of titania precursor up to five times the concentration of surfactant has significant effect on the device performance, however further increase in the concentration of titania precursor does not influence the device performance (see Table S1 in ESI†). The comparison of the performances of DSSCs using meso-TiO2 synthesized from CTAB, DOTAB and OTAB with the same optimal molar ratio of SC/TIPR = 1/5 seems to be quite interesting. We noticed an increase in conversion efficiency from 6.6 to 7.1 to 7.5% as we move from OTAB to DOTAB to CTAB surfactants. Using cationic surfactants with different chain lengths, the surface area and the pore size of the meso-TiO2 has been varied. The higher the surface area, larger the number of dye molecules adsorbed on the TiO2 surface and the more amount of light harvested, thereby generating higher photocurrent of the cell. From Table 2, we see that the amount of dye as well as Jsc increases monotonically with increase in the surface area of meso-TiO2 synthesized from OTAB, DOTAB and CTAB templates.

 Fig. 6  Photocurrent density-voltage curves for DSSCs fabricated from various TiO2 samples synthesized using CTAB under different molar ratio. 
We have also noticed that the open circuit voltage increases by 23 mV as we change the template from OTAB to CTAB. This could be explained in terms of the position of the Fermi level of TiO2 with respect to the redox potential of the electrolyte. As the surface area increases, a greater number of electrons would be generated due to the capture of more number of photons by dye molecules. Assuming that these electrons are transferred to the conduction band of the TiO2, it is concluded that the electron density in the conduction band [CB] increases, which would in turn shift the Fermi level towards CB. In a DSSC, the open circuit voltage is essentially the difference between the Fermi level in TiO2 under illumination and the redox potential of the electrolyte.5 Since the same electrolyte is used for all the cells the increase in the voltage could be due to an increase in the density of electrons in the CB. Thus, the Jsc and Voc increase, resulting in enhancement of fill factor and the overall efficiency. The highest efficiency obtained is 7.5% for the cell made from sample C5.

Fig. 7 shows the comparison between photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the cell using the TiO2 with mesoporous structure prepared from the three surfactants and P-25. The short-circuit current density Jsc of P25 cell is nearly 20% lower than that of meso-TiO2. Lower Jsc of P25 based solar cell can be attributed to the fact that the lower electron density of photoelectrons are generated owing to its smaller surface area (∼50 m2/g) which allows less amount of adsorbed dye (4.7 × 10−7 mol cm−2), nearly 1.5–2 times lower than that by meso-TiO2. Another possible reason could be due to the smaller electron diffusion coefficient in P25, which is several orders of magnitude less than that of pure anatase based meso-TiO2.31 In addition, the high crystallinity and well interconnected grains in meso-TiO2 might have favored increased diffusion length for a facile charge transport.32

The average pore size of C5, O5 and D5 meso-TiO2 samples are around 5.7 to 7.0 nm and the molecular size of N3 dye is approximately 1.5 nm. Thus, a monolayer of the dye molecules adsorbed on the pore walls, leaves an aperture of 4–5 nm for the diffusion of the electrolyte, which is slightly larger than the size of the I3− ion, thus facilitating easier access for the liquid electrolyte. In such a case, the transport of I3−/I− ions within the electrolyte from counter electrodes to the dye or vice versa would be fast enough to regenerate the dye molecules which are subjected to the light illumination. The higher values of fill factor observed in this work are the evidence for such a process (Table 2).
A mesoporous TiO2 with high surface area is essential and also important for achieving an efficient DSSC. Keeping these pre-requisites in mind, we have successfully synthesized mesoporous TiO2 with high surface area, facilitating the large amounts of dye molecules to be loaded, which then give rise to higher short-circuit current densities upon light absorption. The nanopores formed in the mesoporous TiO2 layer are sufficiently large in size, providing an excellent mutual connectivity for the efficient diffusion of ions in electrolytes. However, it is worth pointing out that the observed efficiency of 7.5% was achieved without applying any pre- or/and post- treatment of TiO2 electrode with TiCl4, which is known to improve current density33–35 and without employing a scattering layer with a large particle size to trap more light and as a reflective coating to reduce transmission losses.35 Further works on the application and optimization of these processes as well as the electrolyte composition to obtain efficiency beyond 10% and a systematic study of the charge transport using impedance spectroscopy are under progress.
Conclusion
In the present investigation, we have designed a soft-template based methodology for synthesizing mesoporous TiO2 using various cationic surfactants as structure directing and pore-forming agents. The obtained mesoporous materials were structurally characterized and employed as photoelectrodes in DSSCs. Meso-TiO2 synthesized using OTAB, DOTAB and CTAB templates exhibit high surface area around 90–135 m2 g−1 with uniform pores with sizes in the range 5.7–7.0 nm. A significant effect of the concentration of titania source with respect to template concentration was observed. The highest efficiency of 7.5% was achieved and attributed to enhanced light harvesting owing to large amount of dye adsorption due to high surface area and large pores of meso-TiO2 anatase providing easy access for the electrolyte. In summary, mesoporous TiO2 used as photoelectrode in DSSCs is beneficial for obtaining high photovoltaic conversion efficiency.

Broader context
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) also referred to as Grätzel cells, after the inventors Brian O Regan and Michael Grätzel, are promising low-cost photovoltaic devices. Efficiencies over 11% have been achieved using liquid electrolytes containing the iodide/tri-iodide red-ox couple. Mesostructured TiO2 with higher surface area and optimal porosity are critical for achieving higher efficiency. The mesoporous structure of the TiO2 electrodes for DSSCs is capable of providing an increased cross section for surface-anchored light harvesters allowing greater light absorption. During the past decade, new synthetic strategies have been developed in designing mesoporous architectures of TiO2 for several applications including DSSCs. This paper discusses the simple surfactant mediated strategy for the synthesis of mesoporous titania using various cationic surfactants under optimized conditions and their characterization, and application as photoelectrodes for DSSCs. The structural merits of the synthesized mesoporous titania are highlighted in terms of photovoltaic performance.
