    , Accepted 4th May 2022First published on 4th May 2022AbstractIn this work, the performance of perovskite solar cell (PSC) devices using semi-crystalline polymers (PNTDT-TT, PNTDT-2T, and PNTDT-2F2T) consisting of bis-lactam 1,5-dioctyl-3,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-1,5-naphthyridine-2,6-dione (NTDT) and different donating units depends on the crystalline nature of the polymer. The N-alkylated NTDT unit endows the final polymer with appropriate solubility without backbone distortion. Therefore, despite having strong intra- and inter-molecular interactions of PNTDT-2F2T, it can be easily processed and show much better film formability at moderate solution temperature compared with typical semi-crystalline polymers. Using fully dopant-free PNTDT-2F2T enables PSCs to achieve very high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 20.6% and 22.19% in MAPbI3- and Cs0.05FA0.90MA0.05PbI2.85Br0.15-based perovskites, respectively, owing to the large crystal coherence length and excellent hole mobility. The device retains nearly 90% of its initial PCE after storage at a relative humidity of ∼90% for 1560 h. The PNTDT-2F2T-based PSCs show consistent performance even after soaking in water because of the dense packing and superior hydrophobicity of the PNTDT-2F2T film. Also, owing to the superior thermal stability, the PSC devices with PNTDT-2F2T retain over 85% of their initial efficiency after continuous thermal aging (80 °C) for 1008 h, whereas spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC devices exhibit irreversible severe degradation.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted significant attention as a renewable light-to-electricity conversion technology owing to their superior optical and electrical properties.1,2 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been remarkably enhanced up to over 25% within the last decade.3 To date, highly efficient PSCs with PCEs exceeding 20% have been realized in n–i–p device architectures, mostly using 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD).4
However, spiro-OMeTAD has a bulky spiro-core and twisted arylamine units, which are not efficient molecular structures for tight packing and intermolecular interactions.5 Chemical dopants such as a Li-based salt (Li-TFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-tBP) are essentially required to overcome the poor electrical properties. Although Li-TFSI improves hole mobility via an oxidation process, the hygroscopic Li-TFSI accelerates degradation under a humid environment6 and results in morphology degradation of the spiro-OMeTAD film by forming pinholes,7 which can be further aggravated by external heat. Also, the addition of 4-tBP lowers the glass transition temperature (Tg) of spiro-OMeTAD.8 Some researchers have been successful in improving device efficiency (>24%) and stability by partially changing the structure of spiro-OMeTAD, but they still use large amounts of chemical dopants, and as a result the PSCs employing those hole transporting materials (HTMs) are still highly susceptible to moisture.9,10
To overcome stability issues, donor (D)–acceptor (A) type conjugated polymers have been developed and applied as a dopant-free HTM due to strong intermolecular interaction and high hole mobility. After an alternating random copolymer (RCP) developed by Kim et al., which is composed of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT), was reported exhibiting a PCE of 17.3% and stable performance for 1400 h, alkyl-substituted BT units have been widely used as an accepting building block for dopant-free D–A type polymers.11
For example, a polymer HTM (named PTEG) employing tetraethylene glycol (TEG)-substituted BT units for solubility exhibited a PCE of 19.8% and stable performance for 200 h at 25% RH.12 More recently, Lee et al. reported a green-solvent-processable HTM, named alkoxy-PTEG bearing TEG-substituted BT, which showed the highest efficiency thus far.13 With an optimized thickness of 30 nm and a mobility of 4.06 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the alkoxy-PTEG HTM, the resulting PSC device showed a PCE of 21.2% and retained 87% of its initial PCE after storage for 30 days at 45 ± 5% RH. Also, the alkoxy-PTEG-based device retained 30% of initial efficiency after annealing at 100 °C for 960 h.
However, the alkyl substituents on the 5- and 6-positions of BT for solubility increase the dihedral angle between BT and the neighboring aromatic rings, weakening the intermolecular interactions and leading to low hole mobility.14,15 In this case, the thickness of the HTM can only be optimized under thin conditions (below ∼50 nm) because of its low mobility, which means that the HTM is not effective as a protective layer. In addition, the hydrophilic nature of the ethylene glycol side chain significantly results in easy moisture penetration into the perovskite layer and makes the device susceptible to external stimuli such as heat.16 For these reasons, most of the previous studies accomplished long-term durability only under moderate conditions (40–50% RH) and cannot prove enough thermal stability, as shown in Table S1.†
D–A type semi-crystalline polymers used in the organic photovoltaic field can be a good alternative because of their excellent optoelectrical and thermal properties owing to their planarity and dense packing motif.17–20 Moreover, their features are maintained even under thick film conditions. There are several examples in which semi-crystalline polymers have been used as an HTM, but as of yet there have been no successful examples reported that exhibit a PCE over 20% or completely surpass the performance of doped spiro-OMeTAD.21,22 Representative semi-crystalline polymers containing unalkylated BT (e.g. BT, fused BT, or fluorinated BT) as an accepting unit exhibit dense packing and high hole mobility; however, they generally require hot solutions (stirring at over 100 °C) and preheated substrates for processing due to their lack of solubility.23–25 For these polymers, the crystallinity of the final polymer film varies depending on the processing conditions (e.g. spin rate and solution temperature) and molecular weight. As a result, the resulting polymer films have different π–π stacking distances and crystal coherence lengths (CCLs) even in a pure polymer film.26 This can be a major obstacle for the practical commercialization of PSC devices employing a semi-crystalline polymer. Therefore, an easy-processing crystalline polymer is needed for high efficiency and long-term stability.
We previously reported a new bis-lactam compound, 1,5-dioctyl-3,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)-1,5-naphthyridine-2,6-dione (NTDT), for organic electronics.27 Unlike the alkylated BT unit that is extended with thiophene rings, the NTDT unit has appropriate solubility via N-alkylation at two positions of 1,5-naphthyridine-2,6-dione (NTD) without backbone distortion. In addition, it has excellent planarity originating from non-bonding intramolecular S⋯O interactions. In particular, when N-alkylated NTDT is introduced into a polymer as an accepting unit, it ensures appropriate solubility of the final polymer product and enables thick film processing without hot processing.28,29 Herein, we report highly efficient and stable PSC devices using a series of NTDT-based semi-crystalline polymers consisting of NTDT as an accepting unit and different thiophene rings as a donating unit (Fig. 1). The different donating units used in the polymer backbone are expected to affect the structural planarity and performance. The photovoltaic performance of devices having an n–i–p device architecture with the NTDT-based polymers was investigated and compared with that of PSCs containing spiro-OMeTAD. With the optimum NTDT-based polymer, our best-performing PSC device achieved an excellent PCE of 22.19% under fully dopant-free conditions. Also, this polymer provided outstanding device endurance against high humidity (90 ± 5% RH) and thermal stress (80 °C) for over 1000 h.

Results and discussion
The NTDT-based polymers were prepared according to a previously reported synthetic procedure.30 The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymers were measured via high-temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 90 °C with trichlorobenzene as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard. The Mn and PDI are 91 kDa and 2.34 for PNTDT-TT, 89 kDa and 3.25 for PNTDT-2T, and 60 kDa and 14.16 for PNTDT-2F2T (Fig. S1†). The large PDI (14.16) of PNTDT-2F2T arises from the bimodally distributed GPC chromatogram. The large PDI may not be the real value and is attributed to the strong aggregation of the polymer. Such a phenomenon can be often observed in crystalline polymers.31 Therefore, we assumed that the molecular weight of the polymer is sufficiently large. The synthesized polymers dissolved well in common solvents such as chloroform. We fabricated thin films of 100 nm thickness and performed atomic force microscopy measurements to investigate the surface morphology and roughness of the films. As seen in Fig. S2,† the morphologies of the polymer films are very smooth, and the root-mean-square (RMS) values are 0.482, 0.539, and 0.609 nm for PNTDT-TT, PNTDT-2T, and PNTDT-2F2T, respectively. Polymer films with small RMS values are beneficial for minimizing series resistance between the hole transporting layer (HTL) and metal electrode.
To check the processability of NTDT-based polymers, we investigated the π–π stacking distance and the CCL values of polymer films that were prepared by hot processing using a preheated substrate and hot solution (stirring at 100 °C) as well as by moderate processing (stirring at 40 °C). Undissolved particles were not observed in either the processing solution or the film, and the π–π stacking distance and the CCL values were almost the same regardless of the process (Fig. S3 and 4 and Table S2†). This implies that the NTDT-based polymers have good processability as an HTM. Also, PNTDT-2F2T with a shorter π–π distance (3.67 Å) and longer CCL (30.97 Å) is expected to exhibit better hole mobility and charge transporting capability than the other two polymers. We performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to study the molecular structures of the three polymers by using Gaussian 09 at the B3LYP level with 6-31G as the basis set (Fig. 2a). The torsional angles (θ1) are 0.64° for PNTDT-TT, 0.26° for PNTDT-2T and 0.04° for PNTDT-2F2T, which are less than 1° due to intramolecular non-bonding S⋯O interaction as we reported previously.27,28 Other angles are quite different depending on monomer units. Compared with the θ3 (4.05°) of PNTDT-2T, the utilization of F atoms can reduce the θ3 (0.81°) of PNTDT-2F2T and promote whole planarity via intramolecular non-bonding S⋯F interaction. To further verify the evidence of non-bonding interactions, we calculated the potential energy surface of NTDT, PNTDT-2T and PNTDT-2F2T (Fig. 2b).32,33 The energy barrier (30.9 kJ mol−1) for rotation between the sulfur of thiophene and the oxygen of the carbonyl group means that the planar conformation is energetically preferable. There is an energy barrier (21.1 kJ mol−1) from the stable state to the metastable state for PNTDT-2F2T, which is larger than that (14.6 kJ mol−1) of PNTDT-2T. The larger energy barrier of PNTDT-2F2T may lead to a more planar backbone with a conformational lock.34 Also, PNTDT-2F2T showed smaller θ2 (9.12°) than PNTDT-TT (θ2 = 22.18°) and PNTDT-2T (θ2 = 14.80°). We can confirm different planarity in the side view. Based on molecular planarity, we anticipate that PNTDT-2F2T has more rigid and strong interchain packing than PNTDT-TT and PNTDT-2T.

(b) The energetically stable state (top line) and metastable state (bottom line) of each molecular structure.

In addition to theoretical calculation, we measured the temperature-dependent solution absorption of NTDT-based polymers to experimentally confirm which polymer has strong intermolecular π–π interaction of the polymer backbone (Fig. S5†). Generally coplanar and rigid polymers show a strong π–π* transition shoulder peak at a long wavelength of solution absorption and this peak is attributed to π–π stacking of the polymer backbone.35,36 At elevated temperature, the shoulder peak can be diminished or largely blue-shifted by weakening intermolecular interaction between polymer chains. PNTDT-TT showed no shoulder peak, but PNTDT-2T and PNTDT-2F2T exhibited shoulder peaks at 677 and 728 nm respectively. While the shoulder peak of PNTDT-2T were shifted and disappeared at 55 °C with increasing temperature, that of PNTDT-2F2T was very slightly shifted (728 → 714 nm) and still existed even at high solution temperature (90 °C). This tendency suggests that PNTDT-2F2T has a highly rigid and strong π–π stacking arising from superior molecular planarity achieved by intramolecular interactions (S⋯O, S⋯F). This characteristic may be favorable for charge transport.
To further understand the relationship between π–π stacking interaction and charge transportation, we calculated the hole mobility values using the Mott–Gurney law (Fig. S6†). The configuration of the hole-only device was indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/polymer HTM/Au. The best hole mobility values were 2.30 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PNTDT-TT, 4.91 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PNTDT-2T, and 2.14 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PNTDT-2F2T (Table S3†). The highest hole mobility of PNTDT-2F2T may be achieved by a smaller π–π stacking distance and longer CCL value, which significantly promote π-orbital overlap and delocalization of the charges.37–39 All polymers exhibited hole mobilities of over ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which are higher than those of previously reported polymeric HTMs. This implies that NTDT-based polymers can be optimized at a thick thickness and be used as an HTM under dopant-free conditions.40
We performed photoluminescence (PL) quenching and time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) measurements to investigate the capability of NTDT-based polymers to extract or recombine hole carriers (Fig. S7†). When the HTL was formed on top of the MAPbI3 layer, the intensity of the PL emission decreased significantly, indicating that hole carriers were efficiently extracted into the polymer HTL (Fig. S7a†). The PL intensities of the samples prepared using PNTDT-TT and PNTDT-2T were lower than that of bare MAPbI3 by 77% and 83%, respectively. As expected, PNTDT-2F2T largely quenched the PL emission, and its intensity was lower than that of bare MAPbI3 by 96%. The TR-PL decay curves of the bare MAPbI3 layer and MAPbI3/HTM bilayers are shown in Fig. S7b.† The average lifetime (τave) of the bilayer samples (34.5, 33.3 and 31.4 ns for PNTDT-TT, PNTDT-2T and PNTDT 2F2T) was shorter than that of bare MAPbI3 (366.4 ns) indicating efficient charge extraction from the perovskite to the HTL. The biexponential decay components are summarized in Table S4.† A fast decay (τ1) is assigned to the charge extraction from the perovskite to the HTL and the bimolecular recombination of free carriers.41,42 A slow decay (τ2) is attributed to interface recombination between the perovskite and HTL. The τ1 (24.6 ns) of PNTDT-2F2T was shorter than that of PNTDT-TT (29.2 ns) and PNTDT-2T (27.3 ns) indicating fast charge extraction from the perovskite and less bimolecular recombination. In addition, the τ2 (37.5 ns) of PNTDT-2F2T is a little longer than that of PNTDT-TT (36.0 ns) and PNTDT-2T (36.5 ns). These results mean that the charge extraction is the fastest and the degree of charge recombination is the lowest at the interface between the perovskite and PNTDT-2F2T.
We fabricated MAPbI3-based planar PSC devices with the configuration of ITO/SnO2/MAPbI3/HTM/Au. The n–i–p device architecture and energy level diagram are shown in Fig. 3a and b. In Fig. S8 and Table S5,† the device using spiro-OMeTAD under dopant-free condition showed a poor PCE of 6.34% with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.97 V, short circuit current density (Jsc) of 20.39 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 0.30, which is similar to the PCE value reported in a previous study.11 In contrast, the PCE was significantly increased up to 17.26% (Voc: 1.08 V, Jsc: 21.52 mA cm−2, and FF: 0.74) under doped conditions because the mobility and conductivity were enhanced by the dopants (Fig. S9†). Fig. 3c shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic plots of the PSC devices fabricated using the optimized conditions of NTDT-based polymer HTMs. A detailed investigation of the performance of the PSC devices was conducted by varying the thickness of the polymer HTLs via manipulation of the solution concentration and efficiency distributions of MAPbI3-based PSCs using NTDT-based polymers as shown in Fig. S10.† The optimized photovoltaic performance data are summarized in Tables 1 and S6.† The devices exhibited considerable differences in the PCE depending on the donating monomer unit used in the polymer backbone. The PSCs with PNTDT-TT showed a maximum efficiency with a PCE of 12.88% (Voc: 1.05 V, Jsc: 19.68 mA cm−2, and FF: 0.62), and the overall performance was quite poor owing to the low Jsc and FF. The PNTDT-2T-based PSCs achieved a PCE of 17.49% (Voc: 1.10 V, Jsc: 22.65 mA cm−2, and FF: 0.70), which is similar to that of doped spiro-OMeTAD. Interestingly, unlike PNTDT-TT and PNTDT-2T, all PSCs using PNTDT-2F2T showed PCE values above 19% at thicknesses between 50 and 150 nm. This outstanding feature and higher performance are obtained by the aforementioned excellent crystallinity and mobility, which are higher than those of the other two polymers.

The best-performing PSC exhibited a PCE of 20.60% (Voc: 1.13 V, Jsc: 24.02 mA cm−2, and FF: 0.75) with an HTM thickness of 120 nm, which is thicker than previously reported polymer HTMs and is expected to show better device stability. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the MAPbI3 based-PSCs with NTDT-based polymers are shown in Fig. S11.† The calculated Jsc values (19.60 mA cm−2 for PNTDT-TT, 22.23 mA cm−2 for PNTDT-2T and 23.59 mA cm−2 for PNTDT-2F2T) from IPCE curves were well matched with the Jsc values obtained from J–V curves.
Fig. S12† shows the J–V curves of hole-only devices in negative and positive voltage regions indicating hole injection and extraction characteristics from the polymer HTL to the metal electrode. The kinked J–V curve of the PNTDT-TT-based device represents unbalanced hole injection and extraction. This may be extremely associated with the reduced device performance.43 On the other hand, the nearly linear J–V curves of PNTDT-2T and PNTDT-2F2T-based devices mean quasi-ohmic or ohmic contact. Moreover, the higher current density of the PNTDT-2F2T-based device suggests the most effective hole injection and extraction among NTDT-based polymers.
For better understanding of different performance, we also performed electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The high-frequency semicircle is the sign of charge transport resistance (Rct), and the low-frequency one corresponds to charge recombination resistance (Rrec) occurring at the interfaces.44 The Nyquist plots of the PSCs using different NTDT-based polymers are shown in Fig. S13† and related data are summarized in Table S7.†Rct exhibited the trend of PNTDT-TT > PNTDT-2T > PNTDT-2F2T with the values 609.98, 480.11, and 362.68 Ω respectively, indicating more efficient charge transportation for PNTDT-2F2T. In addition, the PNTDT-2F2T-based device showed the largest Rrec value while PNTDT-TT showed the smallest one. This implies that the recombination loss in the device with PNTDT-2F2T was much reduced compared with those in other NTDT polymer-based devices. Thus, the utilization of NTDT-2F2T enables improved charge transportation as well as reduced recombination inducing higher Voc and FF.
To enhance the PCE of PSCs based on PNTDT-2F2T, we adopted a mixed cation and halide perovskite (Cs0.05FA0.90MA0.05PbI2.85Br0.15) and achieved an improved PCE of 22.19% (Fig. 4a) with a Voc of 1.16 V, a Jsc of 24.66 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.78, which is higher than that (20.72%) of the device using doped spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. S14†). To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency among the fully dopant-free D–A type polymer-based n–i–p PSCs reported thus far. The calculated Jsc value (24.39 mA cm−2) is consistent with the value obtained from the J–V curve (Fig. 4b). A bias of 0.97 V was continuously applied to the PSC device, and the current was saturated at 22.24 mA cm−2 within 5 s (Fig. 4c). The statistical distribution of the PCE demonstrates the reproducibility of the PNTDT-2F2T-based PSC device (Fig. 4d). In addition, the hysteresis phenomenon, which is commonly observed in planar n–i–p PSCs, was negligible as shown in Fig. S15.†

The long-term moisture stability of PSC devices without encapsulation was tested over 1560 h in our humid chamber (90 ± 5% RH) (Fig. 5a). In the case of doped spiro-OMeTAD, the PSC devices retained 30% to 70% of their initial performance after 48 h, and then precise performance evaluation was impossible. In contrast, the MAPbI3-based devices with PNTDT-2F2T exhibited consistent performance and retained over 90% of their initial efficiency even after 1560 h. The Cs0.05FA0.90MA0.05PbI2.85Br0.15-based PSC devices with PNTDT-2F2T also exhibited superior moisture stability maintaining almost 92% of initial performance after 1008 h (Fig. S16†). We thoroughly investigated the internal change of the perovskite layer underneath the HTM via grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), which is a powerful tool for obtaining information from the inside of thick films owing to its strong beam energy. We first investigated bare PbI2 and MAPbI3 samples to compare each peak in the devices as a function of storage time (Fig. S17†). The characteristic (001) plane peak of PbI2 and the (110) plane peak of MAPbI3 were observed at qz values of 0.9 and 1.0, respectively. For the pristine device with doped spiro-OMeTAD, the (110) plane peak of MAPbI3 was present and the PbI2 peak was absent, whereas a PbI2 peak was clearly observed in devices that had been stored under humid conditions (Fig. 5b). The perovskite layer of devices exposed for more than 400 h was completely decomposed into PbI2. In contrast, we could not observe a PbI2 peak in either pristine or exposed devices using PNTDT-2F2T and the peaks of PNTDT-2F2T were well maintained (Fig. 5c). This suggests that PNTDT-2F2T functions not only as a good charge transporting layer, but also as a good moisture barrier.

We conducted J–V measurements before and after soaking the devices in water to explore how PNTDT-2F2T effectively prevents moisture penetration. Although the pristine device using doped spiro-OMeTAD worked well, accurate performance evaluation was impossible after dipping it in water because the shape of the J–V curve was irregular and fluctuated as a result of traps induced by water molecules (see ESI Video†). In contrast, the device with PNTDT-2F2T exhibited no change in performance before and after soaking in water. As seen in Fig. S18,† the water contact angles of the doped spiro-OMeTAD and PNTDT-2F2T films were 50.1° and 106.3°, respectively. The high hydrophobicity of PNTDT-2F2T is highly efficient for preventing water ingression into the perovskite layer.
The thermal stability of PSC devices is one of the most important factors for commercialization. In Fig. S19,† PNTDT-2F2T did not exhibit any thermal transition below 350 °C in differential scanning calorimetry and thermal decomposition below 400 °C in thermogravimetric analysis, which can be seen in typical semi-crystalline polymers.45 The PNTDT-2F2T-based PSC device is expected to show better thermal endurance than the devices using spiro-OMeTAD or polymers reported previously. In Fig. 6a, the doped spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs maintained about 5% of their initial performance after thermal aging on a hot plate at 80 °C for 1008 h. On the other hand, the PNTDT-2F2T-based PSCs exhibited highly stable performance retaining over 85% of their initial efficiency after thermal annealing under the same conditions. Generally, additive doping of spiro-OMeTAD leads to a significant decrease in Tg from 120 to 50 °C and the severe deformation of the spiro-OMeTAD film arises from crystallization when thermal annealing is continuously applied.8,46 To confirm the morphological change of all layers, the cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were investigated for pristine and thermally aged devices with doped spiro-OMeTAD or dopant-free PNTDT-2F2T (Fig. 6b–e). After thermal aging at 80 °C for 1008 h, pinholes were found in the spiro-OMeTAD layer (Fig. 6c, red circle) because of the gradual evaporation of 4-tBP as previously reported.47 In the top-view SEM image, crystallization and pinholes were found on the surface of the thermally aged spiro-OMeTAD layer compared to the pristine one (Fig. S20a and b†). Also, the aged spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC device has smaller perovskite crystals with some pinholes (Fig. 6c, blue circle) than that of the pristine device (Fig. 6b). This is probably because 4-tBP corrodes the perovskite layer.48 These pinholes provide pathways for gas molecules and mobile ions leading to device degradation. By contrast, the PSC device using PNTDT-2F2T did not exhibit any pinholes maintaining a stable morphology (Fig. S20c and d†) and all layers of the PSC device were kept even after thermal aging at 80 °C for 1008 h (Fig. 6e).

For further clear understanding of the degradation mechanism, we examined the composition change of pristine and thermally aged devices by performing time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). In Fig. 7, the ToF-SIMS depth profiles of pristine devices (solid lines) are compared with those of aged ones (dashed lines). In the pristine device employing doped spiro-OMeTAD, the Li+ signal was detected between the perovskite (Pb2+) and Au layers, but the Li+ signal was significantly shifted toward the perovskite layer and SnO2/perovskite interface in the thermally aged device (Fig. 7a). This implies that Li+ ions diffused out from the spiro-OMeTAD layer and induced degradation. In contrast, the Li+ signal was not detected in PSC devices with the dopant-free PNTDT-2F2T, and the atomic distribution of pristine and thermally aged devices was comparable without any segregation of atoms (Fig. 7b). Thus, the utilization of dopant-free semi-crystalline PNTDT-2F2T enables the PSC device to be resistive to harsh moisture and heat conditions. The moisture and thermal stabilities of the PSCs employing PNTDT-2F2T were compared with those of previous literature using D–A type polymers (Fig. S21, Table S1†). Surprisingly, the PNTDT-2F2T-based PSCs showed the most stable performance not only under a humid environment (90 ± 5% RH), but also under thermal stress conditions (annealed at 80 °C). In addition, the PSC devices exhibited stable operational stability (1 sun in a N2 atmosphere) and damp heat stability (85 °C/85% RH) for 800 h maintaining about 88% and 95% of initial performance (Fig. S22†). This work highlights the importance of the intrinsic properties of semi-crystalline polymers in order to boost the performance and preserve the device lifetime under harsh environmental conditions.

Conclusions
We have demonstrated a PSC device highly stable to moisture and heat by employing fully dopant-free PNTDT-2F2T. The combination of an N-alkylated NTDT accepting unit with fluorinated bithiophenes enables the polymer to be easily processed and have a coplanar structure in the film state due to non-bonding covalent intramolecular interactions (S⋯O and S⋯F). As a result, PNTDT-2F2T has a shorter π–π stacking distance and longer CCL value. In addition, there is no thermal transition below 350 °C. Owing to superior electrical and thermal properties induced by strong intra- and inter-molecular interactions, the dopant-free PNTDT-2F2T-based PSC device exhibited a PCE of 22.19% maintaining over 90% and 85% of their initial PCE after 1008 h under 90 ± 5% RH and continuous thermal annealing (80 °C), respectively. The PNTDT-2F2T HTM showed the highest performance and superior long-term durability among D–A type conjugated polymers reported to date. These results demonstrate that a semi-crystalline polymer is a promising dopant-free HTM candidate for simultaneously enhancing efficiency and stability. We expect that our results will provide a new direction for high-performance and stable PSCs.
