    , Accepted 4th March 2016First published on 7th March 2016AbstractIn this work, we show the effect of the thermal treatment temperature on the photoelectrochemical (PEC) activity of CdSe/TiO2 nanocomposites. TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) were synthesized by anodization and the nanocomposites were obtained by depositing CdSe clusters via magnetron sputtering. A two-step thermal treatment was performed: heating the TiO2 NTs at different temperatures prior to CdSe deposition and further heating the CdSe/TiO2 nanocomposites. The nanocomposites were characterized by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). To compare the PEC performance of the CdSe/TiO2 nanocomposites and pristine TiO2 NTs, linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves were obtained under visible light and under 1 sun illumination. It was observed that CdSe incorporation into the TiO2 template enhances the visible light absorbance thereby improving the PEC performance of the nanocomposites. We have found that the optical, structural and PEC properties of the CdSe/TiO2 nanocomposites are dependent on the thermal treatment temperature of the TiO2 nanotubular substrate, prior to CdSe deposition. Moreover, a three-fold improvement in photocurrent was observed upon further thermal treatment of the obtained nanocomposite.
Introduction
Due to its properties such as chemical stability in aqueous electrolytes and low production cost, TiO2 has been the most extensively studied semiconductor for PEC hydrogen production via water splitting.1–4 Among many nano-architectures, highly ordered one-dimensional TiO2 nanotubular arrays, presenting high conductivity and improved electron transfer, have been widely applied in PEC devices.5,6 However, the large bandgap (∼3.2 eV) of TiO2 prevents efficient absorption of sunlight within the visible range, resulting in poor solar energy conversion efficiencies. To address this issue, different approaches have been studied, in particular, the ones that fall into two categories: bandgap narrowing via elemental doping7–11 and sensitizing TiO2 with narrow bandgap semiconductors such as CdSe, CdS, and CdTe.12–14 Various chemical methods such as sol–gel,15 chemical bath deposition,16,17 spray pyrolysis,18 and electrochemical deposition19 and physical methods such as sputter deposition have been used to obtain the sensitizers.20,21 Among these methods, depositing sensitizers on TiO2 templates by sputtering is a very interesting technique. It is clean and provides a good physical contact between the semiconductors, without the need for encapsulating chemical species around the sensitizers, which enables facile interfacial charge transfer to TiO2.2,15,20 In addition, in contrast with the chemical synthesis routes where elements such as Cd and Se can be exhausted into the atmosphere, the direct sputtering of sensitizers on TiO2 inside a vacuum chamber avoids environmental contamination.
It is well known that at thermal treatment temperatures between 450 °C and 600 °C, the TiO2 NTs crystallize to anatase and a barrier layer of TiO2 in the rutile phase is formed at the Ti–TiO2 interface. Above 600 °C, the rutile content tends to increase and according to previous results, the tubular morphology remains preserved until ca. 750 °C.22–24 Indeed, the presence of this barrier layer in the tubular matrix can increase series resistance, affecting the PEC performance. Usually, TiO2 nanotubular substrates are heated to a single temperature prior to sensitization and the formed nanocomposites are used in PEC applications. However, post-thermal treatment of the nanocomposites can be crucial to improve the interaction between the sensitizer and the semiconductor.25–27 Therefore, in order to improve the PEC activity of the nanocomposites, investigations on pre- and post-thermal treatment are guaranteed to provide new information on the interaction between the semiconductors.
This paper describes the synthesis of TiO2 NTs by anodization and CdSe sensitization by magnetron sputtering. We report on how the thermal treatment temperature prior to and after CdSe deposition can synergize the CdSe–TiO2 interaction, to decrease the interfacial resistance of the system and consequently to improve the PEC activity.
Materials and methods
Ti sheet (98.6%, 30 mm diameter, 4 mm thick), ethylene glycol (ETG, 99.5%), ammonium fluoride (98%, Synth) and acetone (99.5%, Vetec) were used in the anodization process. For the photoelectrolysis, sodium sulfide (Merck) and sodium sulfite (Synth) were used. All of the reagents were used as received. For the sputtering, CdSe target (99.99%) (AJA/International) and argon (99.9999%) were used.
Synthesis of CdSe/TiO2 NT nanocomposites
TiO2 NTs were synthesized by the anodization process performed in a standard two-electrode electrochemical cell immersed in an ultrasonic bath. A Ti plate was used as an anode and a copper plate was used as a cathode. The bath temperature was kept between 23 and 25 °C by using a Thermo Scientific continuous flow system. The electrolytic solution was composed of ETG + 10% H2O + 0.5% NH4F (w/w). The applied potential was kept at 20 V for 1 h. The as-anodized TiO2 NTs were thermally treated at 400, 500 and 600 °C for 3 hours in air.28,29 The TiO2 nanotubular substrates were sensitized by CdSe clusters deposited by sputtering using Orion-8 UHV AJA International equipment, with an RF power of 50 W and a deposition rate of 0.057 nm s−1 for 30 min. The substrate holder was rotated at a frequency of 20 rpm to obtain uniform CdSe films. Background sputtering pressure was 2 × 10−9 mbar and the working pressure was 2 × 10−2 mbar of Ar (99.9999%). The nanocomposites CdSe/TiO2 NTs were subjected to post-thermal treatment at 400, 500 and 600 °C for 30 min in air.
Characterization
The chemical composition and purity of the nanocomposites were determined by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS), carried out using a He++ ion beam. The detector was positioned at 15° from the beam. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Shimadzu, Maxima XRD-7000 diffractometer with CuKα radiation. All of the measurements were performed at a lower incident angle of 1.5° in the 2θ range from 20 to 50° with a step size of 0.05° and time of 2 s per step with grazing angle XRD diffractograms. The morphology was investigated using a FEI Inspect F50 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), operated at 10 kV with a secondary electron detector. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy was performed by using a Titan microscope operating at 300 kV. The atomic positions were observed by using high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) STEM images and EDX line profiles, obtained using a Titan microscope operated at 300 kV. UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained in diffuse reflection mode, performed using a Varian Cary 5000 UV-visible spectrophotometer.
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) characterization
PEC experiments were performed using an Autolab (PGSTAT 100N) potentiostat. The measurements were carried out in a quartz cell using a standard three-electrode configuration cell, with a platinum wire as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and CdSe/TiO2 nanocomposites as the working electrode. During the measurements the working electrode was irradiated with a 300 W xenon lamp with light intensity calibrated to 100 mW cm−2. The measurements were performed using either an AM 1.5 G filter (1 sun) or a UV cut-off filter (visible light, λ ≥ 400 nm). To prevent photocorrosion of the CdSe, an aqueous solution of 0.24 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 electrolyte was used.30,31 EIS measurements were performed under illumination conditions (100 mW cm−2), in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz at an amplitude of 10 mV under open circuit voltage.
Results and discussion
The as-anodized TiO2 NTs were thermally treated at 400, 500 and 600 °C for 3 hours. Fig. 1(a and b) show the SEM images of the nanotubes thermally treated at 600 °C. The average length, inner diameter, and wall thickness were found to be 1 ± 0.1 μm, 71 ± 9.3 nm and 26 ± 2.5 nm, respectively. The same morphology was observed for the samples thermally treated at 400 and 500 °C (not shown).

Fig. 2a presents the grazing angle XRD patterns that were obtained at a low incident angle of 1.5° which helped to decrease the signal contribution from the Ti substrate (JCPDS # 44-1294) positioned at 2θ = 36.31°, 38.43° and 40.25°. The diffractograms of the as-anodized nanotubes present only the Ti peaks indicating that the structure is amorphous.

Diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.35°, 38.52° and 48.16° characteristic of the anatase phase (JCPDS # 84-1286) can be observed in all thermally treated samples. An additional peak, at 2θ = 27.48°, observed in the sample heated at 600 °C, is related to the rutile crystalline phase (JCPDS # 76-0649). As described earlier in the literature, at 600 °C the rutile phase grows at the interface between the nanotubes and the titanium sheet.32,33 Therefore, the presence of the rutile phase is related to the barrier layer formed on the substrate, and not in the tubular matrix. To improve light absorption, CdSe clusters were deposited by magnetron sputtering onto the thermally treated nanotubes. Fig. 2b presents the grazing angle XRD patterns of CdSe/TiO2 NT nanocomposites. The diffraction peaks characteristic of the hexagonal phase of CdSe (JCPDS # 65-3436) are observed at 2θ = 23.8°, 25.4°, 42°, 45.8° and 49.7°. Additionally, the characteristic diffraction patterns of Ti and the anatase phase of TiO2 are also observed.34,35 As previously discussed, the as-anodized samples are amorphous, but the CdSe peaks in the diffractogram indicate that the as-deposited CdSe clusters are crystalline in nature and the substrate has no interference in crystallization. The broadening of the peak at 25.3°, corresponding to the anatase phase, is related to the overlapping with the diffraction peak of CdSe at 25.4°. Fig. 2c shows the UV-vis absorbance spectra of the samples. Compared to pristine TiO2, the nanocomposites present a large red shift of the band edge, resulting in a large improvement in the light absorption. Moreover, a slight dependence on the thermal treatment temperature of the TiO2 substrate is observed. Interestingly, the nanocomposite obtained by depositing CdSe on amorphous TiO2 (as-anodized) presents an absorption maximum at ca. 430 nm; however, once the substrate becomes crystalline, after heating at 400 °C, a red shift of around 40 nm is observed. For the samples heated at 500 and 600 °C, an even larger red shift is observed, associated with the growth of the CdSe crystallite.36,37 As one can observe, the spectra of the nanocomposites present oscillation patterns, which are not observed in the spectrum of pristine TiO2. This phenomenon results from thin film optical interference: due to the deposition of CdSe clusters resulting in the formation of a thin CdSe film on the TiO2, the optical interfaces lead to a division of the incident light into a multitude of coherent waves.38–41

Fig. 3a and b show the RBS spectra of CdSe deposited on silicon and TiO2 NTs that were obtained with a beam energy of 2 MeV and 3 MeV, respectively. CdSe was deposited on silicon to avoid the influence of oxygen in the RBS measurement. The presence of just Cd and Se in the spectrum along with Si, that is the substrate contribution clearly indicates that the CdSe deposited by the magnetron sputtering technique does not present impurities in its composition. In Fig. 3b the presence of Cd and Se, as well as Ti and O of the nanotube matrix can be observed. In both spectra the composition was obtained as 1:1 of Cd to Se. These results show that the CdSe maintains its stoichiometry which is invariant for both substrates. Fig. 3(c and d) show the SEM images of the CdSe/TiO2 NT nanocomposites obtained by depositing CdSe on thermally treated TiO2 nanotubular substrates. In Fig. 3c and d one can observe that the nanotubular shape is preserved and the top down growth of the CdSe clusters follows the tubular shape where the majority of CdSe is formed on the top of the nanotubes. Fig. 4 displays the HRTEM and STEM images obtained from the CdSe/as-anodized TiO2 NTs. The interplanar distance of ∼0.36 nm observed by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of a single CdSe particle is in agreement with the [010] crystalline plane of the hexagonal phase of CdSe.42Fig. 4(b) shows a top view STEM image of TiO2 NTs decorated with several CdSe nanoparticles.

 Fig. 4  HRTEM and STEM images of the CdSe deposited on amorphous TiO2 NTs; length view (a) and top view (b); the insets show the selected area electron diffraction patterns and the EDX spectrum recorded from the length of the NTs. 
The selected area diffraction pattern (inset) is in agreement with a set of randomly aligned crystalline CdSe particles. The presence of crystalline planes related only to CdSe shows that the as-deposited clusters are crystalline; however, the as-anodized TiO2 NTs are amorphous corroborating the XRD patterns of Fig. 2.43 A typical energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) pattern (inset) recorded from the length of the nanotubes reveals the composition of Cd, Se, and Ti. Several spectra were acquired in different regions of the tube using STEM. These results show that the CdSe clusters are sprinkled through the pores of the vertically oriented TiO2 NTs, thereby decorating the length of the nanotubes. In addition, the Cd to Se ratio is close to 1 which shows that the stoichiometry of CdSe is invariant. Therefore, CdSe/TiO2 nanocomposites in which the CdSe is deposited via magnetron sputtering are not only free of any chemical species, but also the stoichiometry of CdSe is preserved.
The nanocomposites were subsequently applied for PEC measurements (Fig. 5). In the Fig. 5b, to isolate the contributions of CdSe and TiO2, the measurements were performed under 1 sun illumination using a cut-off filter at 400 nm to filter the UV contribution. Under 1 sun (Fig. 5a) the highest photocurrent (0.22 mA cm−2) was obtained from CdSe/NT-400, meanwhile the lowest photocurrent (0.06 mA cm−2) was obtained from the as-anodized CdSe/NT. This result is expected as amorphous TiO2 presents very poor electrical conductivity, which directly affects the PEC activity. The CdSe/NT-400, CdSe/NT-500 and CdSe/NT-600 presented a similar behavior and a current density of ca. 0.30 mA cm−2, 0.25 mA cm−2 and 0.27 mA cm−2, respectively. The same trend was observed while irradiating the nanocomposites using a 400 nm cut-off filter while a slight decrease of around 20% was observed in photocurrent as compared to 1 sun irradiation. Comparing the PEC performance under 1 sun and using a cut-off filter, one can conclude that CdSe is the main source of photogenerated electrons. In addition, under both illumination conditions, the nanocomposites obtained by depositing CdSe on the TiO2 thermally treated at 400 °C present the best PEC response.

Considering the J–V curves displayed in Fig. 5, aiming to improve the PEC performance, the CdSe/TiO2 nanocomposites were post-annealed at 300 °C for 30 min. From the XRD patterns displayed in Fig. 6a one can observe that the nanocomposites presented better separation between the diffraction peaks related to the anatase phase of TiO2 at 2θ = 25.4° and the peak related to CdSe at 2θ = 23.9°, suggesting a change in the interaction between the materials. Furthermore, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 35.27° and 49.84° of the hexagonal phase of CdSe, now more evident,43,44 can be related to an increase in the crystallinity of the sample due to the thermal treatment.45Fig. 6b shows that (CdSe/NT-400)300, (CdSe/NT-500)300 and (CdSe/NT-600)300 present nearly the same absorption maxima as observed before thermal treatment (Fig. 2c). However, a ca. 30 nm red shift of the maximum absorption wavelength of (CdSe/as-anodized)300 is observed when compared to the same nanocomposites before thermal treatment at 300 °C (Fig. 2c). Therefore, in the nanocomposites obtained on the TiO2 substrates thermally treated at temperatures equal to or higher than 400 °C (crystalline TiO2) no significant displacement of the absorption maximum was observed, on the other hand, for the as-anodized sample (amorphous TiO2) a large red shift was observed.
 Fig. 6  XRD diffractograms (a) and UV-Vis spectra (b) of the samples thermally treated after the deposition of CdSe. 
To evaluate the effect of the post-thermal treatment on the PEC properties of the nanocomposites, LSV experiments were performed under 1 sun and visible light irradiation (Fig. 7). As observed in the previous measurements (Fig. 5), the PEC response of the nanocomposites to 1 sun irradiation is improved when compared to visible light irradiation (using the 400 nm cut-off filter).

No improvements in photocurrent were observed from the nanocomposite obtained on TiO2 previously treated at 600 °C i.e., (CdSe/NT-600)300 which presents nearly the same value of photocurrent density as before heating. However, from (CdSe/NT-400)300 and (CdSe/NT-500)300 a significant gain in fill factor and a large improvement in photocurrent density that reached 0.66 mA cm−2 and 0.52 mA cm−2, i.e. a two-times increase, were obtained by post-thermal treatment at 300 °C. These results strongly suggest that the post-thermal treatment has improved the interaction between CdSe and TiO2, resulting in lower interfacial charge transfer resistance. Considering that the open circuit potential did not change, but the photocurrent and the fill factor were improved, we suggest that thermal treatment affected directly the conductivity of the material, decreasing series resistance. In addition, all of the samples generated almost the same open circuit potential at 1 sun and 1 sunFR400 as earlier observed in Fig. 5. This result indicates that the conduction band energy of TiO2 is not influenced by thermal treatment. To analyze the charge transportation at the CdSe|TiO2 interface, EIS was performed (Fig. 8a) under 1 sun illumination at the open circuit potential for each nanocomposite. Incomplete semicircle curves characteristic of non-ideal capacitance systems can be observed in all of the samples. The impedance spectra were fitted using the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 8a, where Rs represents the solution resistance, Rp is the polarization resistance and CPE is the constant phase element.46 The solution resistance was almost 19 Ω for all the samples. However, Rp values for (CdSe/NT-600)300, (CdSe/NT-500)300 and (CdSe/NT-400)300 were 865, 554 and 394 Ω, respectively. These results indicate that (CdSe/NT-400)300 presents improved interfacial charge transportation properties. On the other hand (CdSe/NT-600)300 presents the highest resistance, which is related to the formation of the rutile barrier between the anatase nanotubes and the Ti substrate.23,24 These analyses corroborate the PEC performance of these nanocomposites (Fig. 7), revealing charge transport improvement at the CdSe|TiO2 interface for the nanocomposites for which the TiO2 substrate was thermally treated at 400 °C. Fig. 8b shows the current versus voltage curves obtained from the pristine as-anodized TiO2 NTs and thermally treated at 400, 500 and 600 °C. As one can observe the as-anodized TiO2 NTs present nearly no photocurrent. Thermally treated samples present an improved photocurrent as well as fill factor compared to the as-anodized TiO2 NTs. The nanotubes thermally treated at 400 °C present a higher photocurrent than that of the sample thermally treated at 500 °C and 600 °C. The low value of the photocurrent of the sample annealed at 600 °C can be explained due to the presence of two crystalline phases (anatase and rutile – Fig. 2a), which might have led to an increase in the resistance. Based on the current vs. voltage curves of Fig. 8b, the pristine TiO2 NTs annealed at 400 °C present the best PEC response and after CdSe deposition, the same substrate presented the best PEC performance. These results strongly suggest that thermal treatment of the substrate plays a major role in the PEC performance of TiO2 sensitized with CdSe.

Conclusions
In summary, CdSe/TiO2 nanocomposites, produced by the deposition of CdSe nanoclusters via magnetron sputtering on TiO2 templates, were investigated as a function of thermal treatment for PEC applications. Optimizing the TiO2 nanotubular substrate via thermal treatment and heating the TiO2/CdSe nanocomposites are key procedures to synergize TiO2|CdSe interfacial interactions for improved PEC performance. The optimum thermal treatment temperature for the pristine TiO2 nanotubular substrate was found to be 400 °C. A 3-fold improvement in the photocurrent was observed when the nanocomposite formed on that substrate was post-treated at 300 °C. Further studies on other semiconductors and their sensitization via magnetron sputtering might lead to obtaining efficient heterostructures with applications in PEC devices and solar cells.
