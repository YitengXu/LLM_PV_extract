    , Accepted 5th January 2016First published on 5th January 2016AbstractTo make quantum-dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) competitive, photovoltaic parameters such as the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and fill factor (FF) must become comparable to those of other emerging solar cell technologies. In the present study, a novel strategy has been successfully developed for a highly efficient surface-modified platinum (Pt) counter electrode (CE) with high catalytic activity and long-term stability in a polysulfide redox electrolyte. The reinforcement of the Pt surface was performed using a thin passivating layer of CuS, NiS, or CoS by simple chemical bath deposition techniques. This method was a more efficient method for reducing the electron recombination in QDSSCs. The optimized Pt/CuS CE shows a very low charge transfer resistance of 37.01 Ω, which is an order of magnitude lower than those of bare Pt (86.32 Ω), Pt/NiS (53.83 Ω), and Pt/CoS (73.51 Ω) CEs. Therefore, the Pt/CuS CEs show much greater catalytic activity in the polysulfide redox electrolyte than Pt, Pt/NiS and Pt/CoS CEs. As a result, under one-sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), the Pt/CuS CE exhibits a PCE of 4.32%, which is higher than the values of 1.77%, 2.95%, and 3.25% obtained with bare Pt, Pt/CoS, and Pt/NiS CEs, respectively. The performance of the Pt/CuS CE was enhanced by the improved current density, Cu vacancies with increased S composition, and surface morphology, which enable rapid electron transport and lower the electron recombination rate for the polysulfide electrolyte redox couple. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and Tafel polarization revealed that the hybrid CEs reduce interfacial recombination and exhibit better electrochemical and photovoltaic performance compared with a bare Pt CE. The Pt/CuS CE also shows superior stability in the polysulfide electrolyte in a working state for over 10 h, resulting in a long-term electrode stability than Pt CE.
1. Introduction
Increasing energy demands, global population, and concerns over global warming have led to greater focus on renewable energy sources in recent years. Despite a high power conversion efficiency (PCE), the high production cost of thin-film solar cells led to the development of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by O'Regan and Gratzel in 1991.1–3 DSSCs have a low-cost and simple fabrication procedure and are of great interest due to their effectiveness in converting incident photons to electric current.4,5 Low to medium-purity materials can also be used. These benefits have attracted attention towards DSSCs as a promising approach for next-generation solar cells.6
Recently, a PCE of around 13% has been achieved with DSSCs under one-sun illumination (AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2). DSSCs generally consist of a dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanode, which plays a key role in determining light absorption and effective separation and transportation of opposite charges generated by the N719 dye molecules, I−/I3− redox electrolyte, and counter electrode (CE).7,8 However, the photo-degradation and instability of DSSCs still make them inferior to conventional Si and thin-film solar cells. Inorganic semiconductors have thus recently been studied as a promising alternative since they show promise for the development of next-generation solar cells. The outstanding characteristics of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) in quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) make them attractive due to their size-dependent tunable band gap with quantum confinement to suit the spectrum of sunlight, high absorption coefficient, the generation of multiple electron carriers under high energy excitation, hot-carrier transfer, and larger intrinsic dipole moments leading to charge separation.9–11 These features make QDs superior to organometallic dyes.
Even though QDSSCs have tremendous advantages, the PCE is still behind that of DSSCs because of electron loss occurring at the photoanode/electrolyte12 and CE/electrolyte interfaces.13 Other possible reasons for the low PCE include the difficulty of assembling a sufficiently large number of QDs on a mesoporous TiO2 and the narrow absorption range of QDs (especially in the case of CdS QDs). Extensive research has been dedicated to increasing the PCE of QDSSCs by synthesizing a new type of semiconductor QDs by various strategies. Sudhagar et al. fabricated photoanodes with various structures and achieved an open-circuit photo voltage (Voc) of 750 mV.14
In QDSSCs, a higher short photocurrent density (Jsc) can be achieved by reducing the charge transfer resistance between the sulfide sensitizers and polysulfide electrolyte. In spite of the comparable Jsc and Voc in DSSCs and QDSSCs, the reported fill factor (FF) for QDSSCs is still far below that of DSSCs, which is typically more than 0.7.15–17 In recent years, much research has been done to boost Voc and FF to increase the PCE without sacrificing Jsc.18,19 The charge transfer resistance at the CE/polysulfide electrolyte interface and series resistance are the main parameters that can noticeably affect the FF.20,21 One of the main techniques for boosting the FF and PCE is improving the conductivity in the active layer and decreasing the charge transfer rate by annealing the CE film. Higher surface area, efficient electrochemically active materials, and narrow band gap semiconductor materials for efficient CEs could lead to similar or even higher FF in QDSSCs than DSSCs.20
Platinum (Pt) is a successful candidate for the CE in DSSCs and is a highly electrocatalytic CE for an organic iodide/triiodide redox electrolyte. Pt is the most widespread CE material in DSSCs and shows low charge transfer resistance (RCE) at the CE/electrolyte interface.21,22 However, in conjunction with the polysulfide redox electrolyte, Pt and other metals like Au are not very catalytic because physical adsorption of sulfur-containing groups on the surface of Pt causes catalytic poisoning, resulting in poor electrocatalytic activity and leading to high over-potential.23,24 This hinders the reduction of the oxidized redox species of the polysulfide electrolyte and rapidly reduces the total conversion efficiency. Therefore, other effective CE materials for the polysulfide electrolyte have been investigated to achieve the maximum electrocatalytic activity and low charge transfer resistance.
The general approach to fabricate metal sulfides for CEs in QDSSCs is exposing the Cu metal to a polysulfide redox electrolyte solution to form a metal sulfide interfacial layer on the Cu substrate.25–27 However, after an acid treatment of the resulting film, the black metal sulfide or CuS film is very easy to peel off from the substrate, which results in detachment from the Cu substrate, leakage of electrolyte solution, mechanical instability, and continual corrosion in the polysulfide electrolyte.27,28 To overcome this problem, several fabrication techniques have been applied to synthesize metal sulfides on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) or indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) substrates. Examples include electrodeposition,29 chemical bath deposition (CBD),30 chemical linking of colloidal QDs,31 and a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method.32 Among these techniques, the CBD technique has gained much attention from many researchers because it requires only a solution container and substrate mounting devices. The resulting film is adherent and uniform. More importantly, there is intimate contact between the donors and acceptors with QDs deposited directly on the FTO substrate by the ionic species from the solutions.
The CE should have low RCE, and it plays major roles of collecting electrons from an external circuit and reducing the Sn2− ions to S2−.33,34 To eliminate the drawbacks mentioned above, carbon nanotubes, mesocellular carbon foam, graphene, CuS, CoS, and NiS have been used to fabricate hole traps at the CE to achieve low resistance and high electrocatalytic activity for the redox reaction. There are many alternatives, but inexpensive metal sulfides such as CuS, CoS, and NiS are the most preferred since they not only yield high PCE but are also cost effective, more abundant, and environmentally friendly.35 The CEs also have superior chemical activity, conductivity, and electrocatalytic properties toward the polysulfide reaction. The material is also attracting much attention for specialized applications, such as photocatalytic H2 generation, supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries, solar cells, and sensors.36,37 Our previous work revealed that CuS, NiS, and CoS are more effective catalytic materials compared to Pt electrodes for the polysulfide electrolyte in QDSSCs.9,20,35
In this study, we report an attempt to fabricate a hybrid CE with combinations of metal sulfides such as CuS, NiS, or CoS and a Pt thin film using the doctor blade method for deposition of Pt and CBD for the deposition of metal sulfides. We studied the effect of the metal sulfide layer on the Pt film for the preparation of hybrid CEs. The metal sulfide layer was used to boost the catalytic activity and reduce the inner energy losses. The resulting Pt/CuS electrode has a large specific surface area, high electrocatalytic activity, and better performance than the bare Pt, Pt/NiS, and Pt/CoS CEs. An energy conversion efficiency of 4.32% was achieved, which is the best efficiency achieved using simple, inexpensive materials and a cost-effective process. Efficiencies of 1.77%, 3.25%, and 2.95% were achieved for the Pt, Pt/NiS, and Pt/CoS CEs under simulated solar light irradiation with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Using the same concentration of the polysulfide electrolyte, we examined the photoelectrochemical performance and the electrocatalytic properties of the Pt/CuS composite electrodes, which were much better than those of the bare Pt, Pt/NiS, and Pt/CoS electrodes.
A schematic of the photoelectrical conversion configuration of TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS and the electrons pathway is shown in Fig. 1. The configuration of the solar cell consists of the TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS QD sensitizer, polysulfide electrolyte, and the composite CE. As shown in Fig. 1, photons are captured by QDs under one sun illumination, yielding electron–hole pairs at the interface between the TiO2 and QDs. The resulting electrons are injected into the TiO2 film from the excited state of CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDs, and the holes are simultaneously scavenged by the CE through the reaction of Sn2− + e−Sn2−. The electrons in the FTO substrate move to the composite electrode via hole transport of the redox couple and participate in the reduction reaction (Sn2− + e−Sn2−). In QDSSCs, an ideal composite CE should possess high electrocatalytic activity and conductivity for the reduction of charge carriers in the polysulfide electrolyte.

2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Cobalt chloride [CoCl2·6H2O], copper sulfate [CuSO4], sodium thiosulfate [Na2S2O3], nickel sulfate hexahydrate [NiSO4·6H2O], triethanolamine, urea [CH4N2O], zinc acetate dehydrate [Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O], sodium sulfide [Na2S], urea [CH4N2O], sulfur [S], selenium [Se], thioacetamide [C2H5NS], and cadmium acetate [Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O] were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All other chemicals were analytical grade and used without any further purification. Commercially available TiO2 paste (Ti-Nanoxide HT/SP) was supplied by Solaronix. A FTO conducting glass with a sheet resistance of 14 Ω square−1 (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to prepare the photo-anodes and CEs.
2.2. Preparation of photo-anodes
FTO was used for the preparation of CEs and photoanodes due to its good electrical conductivity and resistance to the corrosive electrolyte. Before the deposition of the material on the substrates, the FTO was cleaned ultrasonically with acetone and ethanol and rinsed with distilled water several times and then dried under an air stream. The TiO2 paste was spread over a FTO substrate by the doctor blade method using commercial TiO2 paste with an active area of 0.25 cm2. This was then annealed at 450 °C for 30 min to remove the organic substances. The CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDs were sensitized on TiO2 using the SILAR method, which is a low-cost and easy process that can be accomplished using a glass beaker. The thickness can also be controlled more easily in the SILAR method than in other methods.32
The TiO2 photo-anodes on FTO substrates were immersed in a solution containing 0.1 M of Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O for 5 min to allow Cd2+ ions to coat the TiO2 electrode. They were then rinsed with distilled water and ethanol to remove the excess Cd2+ ions. The electrodes were then dipped into 0.1 M Na2S for 5 min, where the pre-adsorbed Cd2+ ions react with S2− ions to form CdS. They were then washed with distilled water and ethanol and desiccated with a hair dryer. These two dipping procedures constitute one cycle, and five cycles were repeated at room temperature to achieve absorption.
For the deposition of CdSe QDs, the TiO2/CdS photo-anodes were dipped into an aqueous solution of 0.1 M of Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O for 5 min, washed with distilled water and ethanol, and dipped into an aqueous solution containing Na2SeSO3 for 5 min at 65 °C. These dipping processes were repeated for 7 cycles. Two cycles of ZnS passivating layers were coated over TiO2/CdS/CdSe using an aqueous solution of 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O and 0.1 M Na2S for 5 min each at room temperature. The layers were washed several times with ethanol and water, dried, and used for the fabrication of QDSSCs. The passivating layer of ZnS can effectively cover the surface of TiO2/CdS/CdSe QDs, resulting in the strong inhibition of electron leakage from QDs to the polysulfide redox electrolyte.38
2.3. Fabrication of Pt, Pt/CoS, Pt/NiS and Pt/CuS counter electrodes

Fig. 2 illustrates the formation steps of the bare Pt and composite CEs for the QDSSCs. For the preparation of the bare Pt, commercially available Pt paste (Solaronix, platinum catalyst T/SP) was applied on the cleaned FTO substrate using the doctor-blade method and heat treated at 450 °C for 10 min in air. The ultrasonically well-cleaned FTO substrates were horizontally dipped in an aqueous solution consisting of 0.1 M CuSO4, 0.4 M CH4N2O, and 0.4 M of Na2S2O3 as a copper source, stabilizing agent, and a sulfide source, respectively. The stabilizing agent may play a more complex role in the CuS film preparation than simply regulating the pH value. The growth solution of the FTO substrate was kept in a hot air oven and maintained at 60 °C for 120 min. The CuS deposited on the FTO substrates was washed several times with distilled water and ethanol and dried with a hair dryer.

For the preparation of the CoS CE, the FTO substrates were horizontally dipped in an aqueous solution consisting of 0.1 M cobalt acetate tetrahydrate, 0.4 M urea, and 0.4 M thioacetamide. The substrates were then placed in a hot air oven at 90 °C for 2 h. For the preparation of the NiS CE, the FTO substrates were horizontally dipped in a solution containing cationic and anionic precursors of NiSO4·6H2O and thioacetamide, which act as sources of Ni2+ and S2−, respectively. The substrate immersed growth solution was kept in a hot air oven, and the deposition temperature was maintained at 90 °C for 60 min. The Pt/CuS, Pt/CoS, and Pt/NiS electrodes were prepared through the deposition of CuS or CoS or NiS onto the surface of the Pt CE using the precursor solution. The deposition temperature in a hot air oven was maintained at 60 °C for 2 h (Pt/CuS CE), 90 °C for 2 h (Pt/CoS CE), or 90 °C for 60 min (Pt/NiS) for the preparation of hybrid CEs.
2.4. Characterization
The crystal structure of the CE films was explored using X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/Max-2400, Rigaku) at 40 kV and 30 mA in the 2θ range of 20–80°. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a VG Scientific ESCALAB 250 with monochromatic Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV). The surface morphology and thickness of the CEs were examined by using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, SU-70 and Hitachi) operated at 10.0 kV. An atomic force microscope (JPK NanoWizard II AFM, JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany) was used to identify the surface roughness of the prepared CEs with a scan rate of 0.8 Hz in contact mode. The optical absorption of the bare Pt and hybrid CE films was examined by using an OPTIZEN 3220 UV spectrophotometer. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using a Biologic potentiostat/galvanostat/EIS analyzer (SP-150, France) in the frequency range of 1 mHz to 100 kHz under one-sun illumination. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the QDSSCs were found using an ABET Technologies (USA) solar simulator under one-sun illumination. Tafel polarization measurement was conducted under dark conditions using symmetric dummy cells.
2.5. Fabrication of QDSSCs and symmetric cells to measure J–V and Tafel analysis
The prepared TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS photo-anode and CEs (bare Pt or Pt/CuS or Pt/NiS or Pt/CoS) were assembled with hot-melt Surlyn (50 μm, Sx170-25, Solaronix) at 100 °C, and the internal space in the CEs was filled through predrilled holes with the polysulfide redox electrolyte (1 M Na2S, 2 M S, and 0.2 M KCl in methanol and distilled water at a ratio of 7:3). The symmetrical bare Pt and hybrid CEs were prepared using the above procedure and sealed and filled with the polysulfide electrolyte through predrilled holes on the counter electrode substrate.
3. Results and discussion
Different reaction conditions such as the deposition time, reaction temperature, capping agent concentration, and preparation method have been reported to have significant impacts on the surface morphology, thickness, optical properties, and particle size of the materials formed using CBD or the doctor-blade method. Hence, a number of studies have been published based on different reaction conditions to understand the role of metal sulfides and to gain insight into the formation mechanism of composite electrodes. In this study, the effect of CuS, NiS, and CoS metal sulfides on a Pt surface was investigated for QDSSC applications.
3.1. Morphology, and structural characterization of the bare Pt and composite electrodes

Fig. 3 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the bare Pt and the Pt/CuS, Pt/NiS, and Pt/CoS thin films deposited on FTO substrates. For the deposition of the metal sulfides on the Pt surface, two main phenomena explain the formation of nanocrystals: the formation of crystal aggregates in the chemical solution is related to nucleation and a combination of ion-by-ion and cluster-by-cluster growth mechanisms. These two mechanisms arbitrarily occur in the CBD method, and the aggregates form from the cluster-by-cluster mechanisms. The SEM analysis reveals that the surface morphology is significantly influenced by the metal deposition on the Pt surface and can produce a high surface area.
 Fig. 3  Scanning electron microscopy images of the bare Pt and composite electrode films deposited on FTO substrates: (a, b, c, and d) low magnification images and (a1, b1, c1, and d1) high magnification images. 
The SEM images in Fig. 3a show that the Pt particles had a uniformly distributed hexagonal morphology. The high-magnification image of the Pt thin films confirmed the well-defined hexagonal architecture with an extremely large particle size of approximately 300–400 nm and with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 32.58 nm. A recent study reported that particles that are too large and have high roughness might decrease the coverage on the Pt film and increase the series resistance of the whole electrode.39
As seen in Fig. 3b (low resolution) and Fig. 3b1 (high-resolution), when CuS was deposited on the Pt surface there are many nanoparticles with barren land like structures that are uniformly distributed. The Pt and CuS crystals were interconnected together and covered the Pt nanoparticles completely. A complete coverage of the Pt with CuS was obtained from the CBD method, which would lead to strong adhesion on the FTO substrate. This results in lower charge recombination and strengthens the electron extraction towards the polysulfide electrolyte.40
With CuS deposition on Pt, the surface morphology is greatly affected and changed from a hexagonal structure to a barren land-like structure. We expected that this favorable surface morphology would effectively increase the flow of the electrolyte ions throughout the whole device, resulting in an excellent electrocatalytic activity and enhanced performance of QDSSCs. Many articles have reported that composite CEs in QDSSCs improve the mass transport behavior of Pt/CuS films. When CoS is deposited on Pt, many 3D frameworks are formed with large voids in their structure, as shown in Fig. 3d.
The SEM results show the structural features of the films, but the presence of particles and the surface roughness cannot be distinguished. The RMS surface roughness of these films was examined by using a scanning probe atomic force microscope (AFM), and 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) images of Pt and Pt/CuS films are shown in Fig. 4. The surface roughness of the Pt and Pt/CuS films is 32.58 and 70.28 nm, respectively as shown in Fig. 4a and b. AFM studies indicated that the RMS surface roughness of the Pt film was much smaller than those of the Pt/CuS or Pt/NiS (36.56 nm) or Pt/CoS (34.21 nm) films. Among all the composite electrodes, the Pt/CuS film exhibited the highest surface roughness. The higher surface roughness of the Pt/CuS film can enhance the electrocatalytic activity for the polysulfide redox electrolyte.41,42 These results also imply that the charge transfer resistance at the CE/polysulfide electrolyte interface would be much lower with the Pt/CuS film.
 Fig. 4  Atomic force microscopy images of thin films deposited on FTO substrates: a, a1 (bare Pt film), b, b1 (Pt/CuS film), c, c1 (Pt/NiS film), and d, d1 (Pt/CoS film). 
The higher roughness is mainly due to the good contact bonding between the Pt and CuS. The results indicate that the deposition of the metal sulfide film on a Pt surface offers more electrocatalytic activity sites for the reaction of the S2−/Sn2− redox couple in the polysulfide electrolyte.42,43 The PCE of the QDSSCs mainly depends on the higher surface roughness of the CE, and the improved surface roughness in the Pt/CuS CE tends to improve the PCE of the QDSSCs and affects the electrocatalytic performance of the polysulfide electrolyte system. For comparison, the surface roughness of Pt/NiS and Pt/CoS films was identified using AFM images, as shown in Fig. 4c and d. From this result, it can be concluded that the deposition of metal sulfide on Pt for the preparation of composite CEs not only increased the surface roughness but also reduced the surface resistivity, which are main factors for enhancing Jsc and PCE.
The XPS measurements were analyzed to better understand the chemical bond configuration, composition, and status of the bare Pt and Pt/CuS catalyst, as shown in Fig. 5.44 The XPS survey scan spectrum exhibits distinct C 1s, O 1s, Pt 4f, and Sn 3d5 peaks from the bare Pt film. The prepared samples were placed under atmospheric conditions for seven days before conducting XPS analysis. The Pt content for the bare Pt catalyst was 8.34%, and the height of the peak was approximately 4811.62. The deconvolution of the high-resolution Pt 4f region (Fig. 5b) contains two pairs of doublets with intense peaks centered at binding energies of 70.18 and 73.57 eV corresponding to Pt(4f7/2) and Pt(4f5/2), respectively.45,46 Three chemically different Pt entities could be identified in Fig. 5b corresponding to oxide Pt(II) with binding energies of 72.9 and 76.2 eV and to oxide Pt(IV) with a binding energy of 77.5 eV. There were also stronger metallic peaks of Pt(0) with binding energies of 70.18 and 73.57 eV.45–47

Fig. 5 displays the high-resolution XPS survey scan for the four constituent elements of Pt/CuS (Fig. 5c), Cu 2p (Fig. 5d), S 2p (Fig. 5e), and Pt 4f (Fig. 5f) for the bare Pt and Pt/CuS film. Fig. 5c shows only C 1s, Cu sp3, N 1s, O 1s, S 2p, and Sn 3d5 elemental peaks on the surface of the FTO, indicating that the prepared Pt/CuS catalyst is relatively pure. The XPS spectrum of Pt/CuS for Cu 2p presents two major peaks with binding energies of 932.86 and 952.61 with a splitting of 19.75 eV, which is in good agreement with the standard separation of Cu(I) (19.9 eV).48
The spectrum of S 2p shows two peaks at 162.04 and 168.85 eV corresponding to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively, with a splitting of 6.81 eV. These are consistent with the binding energy of sulfur in the sulfide state of CuS. These Cu 2p and S 2p peaks were accompanied by weak shake-up satellite peaks as shown in Fig. 5d and e, which indicates the presence of the paramagnetic chemical state of Cu+ and S−. These results and binding energies are in agreement with the previously reported values of the binding state of the elements of CuS. However, after CuS deposition on Pt, XPS analysis shows that the Pt peaks were greatly reduced compared to those of the bare Pt film.
3.2. Electrocatalytic abilities of the bare Pt and composite CEs towards the polysulfide electrolyte
We employed EIS to elucidate the internal resistance, interfacial charge transfer, electron transport properties, recombination properties, and Warburg diffusion resistance in the polysulfide electrolyte. The corresponding Nyquist plots for the frequency range of 100 mHz–500 kHz were measured under a simulated light source of 100 mW cm−2, and the resulting electrochemical parameters are shown in Table 1. Fig. 6b shows the Nyquist plots for QDSSCs using Pt, Pt/CuS, Pt/NiS, and Pt/CoS CEs and the same type of TiO2/CdS5/CdSe8/ZnS2 photoanode. Fig. 6a shows the equivalent circuit used to fit the resulting curves with Z-view software. The prepared QDSSCs incorporating the polysulfide redox electrolyte and photoanode had an effective area of 0.25 cm2, and the CE had an effective area of 0.8 cm2.

All of the Nyquist plots of QDSSCs or DSSCs comprising a redox electrolyte commonly display three semicircles.49,50 The starting point of the first semicircle is the series resistance (Rs), which shows the transport resistance of FTO and all resistance outside of the QDSSCs. The left circle at high frequency signifies the electron transport resistance at the CE/polysulfide electrolyte interface (RCE), which is parallel to the CE capacitance. The second semicircle signifies the charge recombination in the conduction band of the photoanode/polysulfide electrolyte interface (Rct), which is parallel to the corresponding chemical capacitance (Cμ). The third semicircle is the Warburg diffusion coefficient (Zw) in the polysulfide electrolyte.
The Rs values for the Pt, Pt/CuS, Pt/NiS, and Pt/CoS CEs are 8.49, 14.65, 8.47, and 8.45 Ω, respectively. The superior Rs value means that the catalytic material is less strongly attached to the FTO substrate and the charge recombination rate is higher. The RCE value for the Pt/CuS CE is 37.01 Ω, which is much lower than those of the Pt (86.32 Ω), Pt/NiS (53.83 Ω), and Pt/CoS CE (73.51 Ω). The lower RCE value of the Pt/CuS CE influences the electron transfer from the CE to the polysulfide electrolyte, which leads to a higher FF and Jsc. The result suggests that the electrons injected at the CE/polysulfide electrolyte interface were more efficient in the presence of an appropriate metal sulfide layer on the Pt surface.9,20,50 Moreover, the value of RCE can be organized well by surface area, thickness of the material, particle size, adhesion between the FTO and the material, the loading and roughness of the electroactive materials, and their composition. The experimental outcomes revealed that the charge transfer resistance can vary as a function of the metal sulfide material deposition on Pt, and the compositional variation played a decisive role in the electrocatalytic activity.

C
μ for the Pt/CuS CE is higher than that of the other three CEs, which reveals enormous collection of photo-excited electrons into the conduction band of the photoanode. This can explain the large current density of the QDSSCs. The capacity to accumulate excited electrons depended on the conduction band position according to eqn (1).51,52 (1)
A larger Cμ value means an upward shift of the Fermi level, which gives a superior Voc value.53 The electrochemical parameters of the Pt/CuS CE (Rs, Rct, RCE, Zw and Cμ) are greater than those of other CEs due to the larger specific surface area, roughness, and strong adhesion on FTO. Interestingly, we used similar photoanodes for all experimental conditions, but the charge transfer resistance at the interface was different because the QDSSCs work with a cyclic nature of CdS/CdSe/ZnS excitation due to an electron transfer to the TiO2 side and the reduction of the redox electrolyte. This cycle is accomplished by the regeneration of CdS/CdSe/ZnS due to the oxidation of the polysulfide electrolyte.54
If the oxidation and/or reduction rate of the polysulfide electrolyte is decreased because of low electrocatalytic activity and Zw values of the CE, the performance of the QDSSCs would be affected. If the charge transfer resistance and surface area are the cause for the reduction rate of the polysulfide electrolyte, then Pt/NiS and Pt/CoS CEs should have exhibited approximately the same or a little low electrocatalytic activity and PCE. However, this is not the case because Pt/CuS-based QDSSCs exhibited a higher PCE than other cells. In addition to the charge transfer resistance and surface area, the higher surface roughness, adhesion between the FTO substrate and Pt/CuS, and increase in the atomic ratio of sulfur in CuS perform crucial roles in increasing the electrocatalytic activity and PCE of the Pt/CuS CE.

Fig. 6c shows the EIS spectra obtained under various applied bias voltages (0 to 0.9 V DC) and various frequencies (100 mHz–500 kHz). The Nyquist plot shows that the diameter of the lower semicircle decreases as the bias voltage increases from 0 to 0.9 V, but the diameter of the higher semicircle is constant. The rate of this back reaction or recombination is faster with increasing bias voltage toward Voc. This can be explained as follows. The excited electrons from the QDs are injected into the conduction band of the n-type TiO2 photoanode while some of the electrons recombine with the electrolyte, which can happen due to various applied bias voltages. This electron recombination rate increases as the bias voltage approaches Voc. Therefore, under bias conditions, the lower frequency semicircle decreases as the number of electrons recombining with the polysulfide electrolyte at the photoanode/electrolyte interface changes.
The arc of the semicircle is closely related to Jsc due to the electron back reaction, and the expansion of this semicircle at a lower frequency corresponds to decreases in Jsc. For the QDSSC based on the Pt/CuS CE, the charge transfer rate at the photoanode/electrolyte interface is higher when the bias voltage increases toward Voc or higher. The RCE values were investigated as a function of bias voltage from the EIS curves, and the resulting graphical diagram is shown in Fig. 6c. The factors that limit the PCE in QDSSCs include RCE, Rct, Cμ, and slower hole transfer and recombination of charge carriers with the electrolyte. A lower charge transfer resistance was obtained in the Pt/CuS CE, which is directly reflected in Jsc and suppressed the recombination process with a more efficient electron transfer. The Pt CE QDSSCs showed an increased charge transfer resistance, which may be due to the increased electron recombination rate with the electrolyte.
These EIS results support the higher recombination rate for the Pt CE, which is worthless for the enhanced Jsc and FF for the QDSSCs subjected to a bare Pt CE, as observed in the J–V measurements. From this, we concluded that the influence of the metal sulfide on a Pt surface can be directly reflected in the measured charge transfer resistance values because a good contact for the composite CE layer is crucial for a smooth charge transfer process. For cells with the Pt/CuS CE, the QDSSCs CE can typically have a quite good contact with the Pt surface. In this case, electrons tend to travel very effectively and thus exhibit the lowest RCE values.
3.3. Optical and photovoltaic performances of different CE cell devices

Fig. 7 shows the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of different CEs. When Pt was coated on the FTO substrate by the doctor-blade method, it showed much less absorbance in the visible region, where there are no sharp absorbance peaks. The absorbance of Pt slightly reaches zero intensity. The absorbance slightly increased with the deposition of CuS particles on Pt. A slight yellow shift was observed between 550 and 600 nm and reached a minimum at ∼800 nm. The UV-vis spectrum of the Pt/CuS film never reaches zero intensity but increases for a longer wavelength region again, which is due to free-carrier intraband absorption.55 The absorption spectrum of the Pt/CoS film shows strong absorption due to high thickness and lies beyond the instrumental limitations. It increases for a longer wavelength more strongly than with the Pt, Pt/CuS, and Pt/NiS films due to free-carrier absorption.
 Fig. 7  Absorption spectra of counter electrodes made of the bare Pt, Pt/CuS, Pt/NiS and Pt/CoS films. 

Fig. 8a shows the UV-absorption spectra of the TiO2/CdS/CdSe cascade photoanode deposited by the SILAR method, which could effectively improve the power conversion efficiency due to broader absorption. Fig. 8a shows the absorption spectra of bare TiO2 and exhibits an absorption edge at about 380 nm. The CdS-sensitized TiO2 electrodes made with five SILAR cycles shift to a longer wavelength of about 504 nm. The absorption onset of CdSe sensitized on TiO2/CdS electrodes after 8 cycles of the SILAR process broadens the light absorption range. Even though more than 8 SILAR cycles lead to a longer wavelength light absorption shifted to the red region at about 625 nm, the PCE is decreased, so the optimized deposition was fixed at 8 cycles.56

These curves were obtained under the illumination of one sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). Pt and composite counter electrodes using the TiO2/CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanodes were filled with a polysulfide electrolyte solution (1 M Na2S, 2 M S, and 0.1 M KCl), and (c, d, e, f) graphical representation of photovoltaic parameters. 
In order to investigate the photovoltaic performance of solar cells with different CEs, cascade photoanodes were fabricated and photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained to compare them with a bare Pt CE. The resulting J–V curves and the corresponding values of open-circuit potential (Voc), fill factor (FF), short circuit current density (Jsc), and PCE are shown in Fig. 8b and Table 2. The QDSSCs with a Pt CE showed a poor FF of 0.47, PCE of 1.77%, Jsc of 5.91 mA cm−2, and Voc of 0.62 V. The poor PCE of the Pt CE is due to the strong absorption of S2− on the surface, which reduces the surface activity. Moreover, QDSSCs with a Pt CE have a very high RCE (86.32 Ω) and Zw (19.22 Ω), which results in very poor PCE, Jsc, and FF. The high Zw is due to the catalytic poisoning of the Pt CE with the redox electrolyte making it unstable.57

The QDSSCs fabricated using Pt/NiS and Pt/CoS CEs show moderate Jsc values of 12.18 and 10.77 mA cm−2 and moderate PCE of 3.25 and 2.95%, respectively. The device with the Pt/CuS CE was far better than those with Pt/NiS and Pt/CoS due to the greater catalytic activity of the electrodes. Pt/NiS shows comparable Voc and current density to Pt/CuS, while the Pt/CoS CE shows very low values. This is due to (1) the lower exchange current density, (2) negative corrosion potential (−0.024 V in Tafel polarization), and (3) higher anodic slope in the Tafel plot than the cathodic slope, as shown in Fig. 9.
 Fig. 9  Tafel polarization curves of the CE with Pt, Pt/CuS, Pt/NiS, and Pt/CoS CEs obtained by using symmetrical cells with two identical electrodes. 
Negative corrosion potential in the Tafel plot indicates that the quasi-Fermi-energy in the Pt/NiS and Pt/CoS CEs would have been −0.024 V, which is essential and shifted upward to equilibrate the quasi-Fermi-energy with redox potential of the polysulfide electrolyte.58 Compared to other CEs, the Pt/CuS CE is already in equilibrium and readily reduces the redox electrolyte. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity and lower charge transfer resistance of the Pt/CuS CE arise from very weak van der Waals forces between S–S layers, which can voluntarily intermingle with anions and cations electrochemically.
The Pt/CuS CE in QDSSCs exhibited higher Jsc and PCE values of 15.31 mA cm−2 and 4.32%, respectively, due to the lower series resistance of the cell and higher electron transport resistance through the photoanode. This reduces the internal resistance, the concentration gradients in the polysulfide electrolyte, and the recombination rates. The surface morphology is also different in that the Pt/NiS and Pt/CoS thin films show lower density, surface roughness, and surface area than the Pt/CuS film. The atomic percentage of sulfur in the Pt/CuS film is also greater, and it has well-arranged densely packed particles with uniform pores that allow the electrolyte to diffuse more freely.
Tafel polarization measurements were performed under dark conditions with the same symmetrical cells used in the EIS analysis. Fig. 9 shows the Tafel measurement of the logarithmic current density as a function of the potential (V) for the oxidation/reduction of the S2−/Sn2− couple. The total curves can be classified into three major zones: the polarization, Tafel, and diffusion zones in the low, middle, and high potential (horizontal part) areas, respectively. The catalytic activity of the resulting CEs can be calculated from the exchange current density (Jo), which can be estimated from the anodic and cathodic branches of the curves.
The electrocatalytic ability of an electrode is directly related to the Jo and can be calculated using eqn (2): Jo = RT/nFRct(2)where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of disulfide at the CE, F is the Faraday constant and Rct is the charge-transfer resistance obtained from EIS analysis. The anodic (βa) and cathodic (βc) branches in Fig. 9 denote the oxidation of S2− to Sn2− ions and Sn2− to S2− ions. The slope of the anodic and cathodic branches of the Pt/CuS CE is larger than those of the Pt/NiS, Pt/CoS, and Pt CEs. It can be suggested that Jo for the Pt/CuS CE indicates more ability to reduce the polysulfide electrolyte and also improves the logarithmic current density.57 The higher anodic slope than the cathodic slope for the Pt/NiS and Pt/CoS CEs means that the oxidation rate is greater than the reduction rate, and hence, CdS/CdSe/ZnS (QDs) regeneration in the solar cell would be harshly affected and lead to very low current density.
The limiting current density (Jlim) for the four symmetric cells increases in the order of Pt < Pt/CoS < Pt/NiS < Pt/CuS. Jlim depends on the diffusion coefficients of the redox couple in the symmetric dummy cell and can be calculated using eqn (3): Jlim = 2nFCD/l(3)where C is the polysulfide electrolyte concentration, D is the diffusion coefficient of the polysulfide, l is the space thickness, and n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of disulfide at the CE. The surface morphology of the Pt/CuS CE has particularly high roughness and surface area. This can decrease the charge transfer resistance, enhance the electron lifetime, and accelerate the diffusion of the electrolyte, which are parameters that affect the PCE of QDSSCs. The Tafel polarization curves confirmed the increase in anodic and cathodic slopes and decrease in the charge transfer resistance in the EIS analysis for the Pt/CuS CE, which has the highest catalytic activity and Jo for QDSSCs.
Electron recombination kinetics of the composite and bare Pt CEs were investigated by monitoring the open-circuit voltage decay curves as a function of time after interrupting the light illumination, as shown in Fig. 10a. Voc delivers an uninterrupted reading of the electron lifetime at high voltage resolution when the light illumination is stopped abruptly or switched off. The excess electrons are removed from the external circuit due to electron recombination with the electron acceptors in the electrolyte.
 Fig. 10  (a) Open-circuit voltage-decay measurements after switching off the illumination of the QDSSCs, (b) bode-plot curves from the electrochemical impedance spectra of the QDSSCs on Pt and composite electrodes. 
The photovoltage of the composite electrodes decays more slowly than that of the bare Pt CE. The Pt CE showed a much faster Voc decay rate, which indicates a higher charge recombination rate and lower charge collection efficiency than the other CEs.59 The Pt/CuS CE has a much slower voltage decay rate based on the barren land-like surface morphology, which produces the lowest recombination rate and enhances Voc and Jsc. This effect also enhances the PCE of QDSSCs. The Voc decay rate is directly related to the electron lifetime according to the following formula (4): (4)
According to the EIS model, the electron lifetime in the prepared cells can be calculated from the angular frequency of the impedance semi-circle arc at mid-frequency:
the electron lifetime values of the Pt, Pt/CuS, Pt/NiS, and Pt/CoS CEs were 0.0716, 0.0895, 0.0846, and 0.0824 ms, respectively. The improved electron lifetime in the Pt/CuS CE may be due to the lower recombination rate of the injected electrons for the reduction of the electrolyte. The electron lifetime decreases for the Pt/NiS and Pt/CoS CEs because the NiS and CoS ions are not compatible with Pt, which can increase the resistance of the film.
A large trap level could also have resulted from the NiS or CoS, which makes electron transfer from the CE side to the polysulfide electrolyte difficult. The higher electron lifetime is due to the lower diffusion coefficient value and lower recombination of the injected electrons with the electrolyte, which results in a significant enhancement of FF and higher electron lifetime and affects the PCE of QDSSCs. The improved electron lifetime and PCE for the Pt/CuS CE may be due to an increase in the atomic percentage of S ions in CuS, which play an important role in improving the surface roughness, morphology, and electrocatalytic activity of the CEs.
3.4. Photo-stability of Pt and Pt/CuS counter electrodes in QDSSCs
To commercialize QDSSCs, the long-term stability of the solar cell is essential. The Pt and Pt/CuS CEs in TiO2/CdS5/CdSe8/ZnS2 QDSSCs were illuminated continuously in a solar simulator with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, which is close to real application conditions. The photovoltaic parameters Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE of the QDSSCs were measured every 1 h for 10 h. The changes in the parameters are presented in Fig. 11. After illumination, the QDSSCs with the Pt/CuS CE showed an outstanding stead and increase in PCE from 4.32 to 4.41%, as shown in Fig. 11c. The PCE is nearly constant thereafter (2 to 10 h) with no measurable degradation. Jsc and Voc decreased slightly, and FF decreased from 0.47 to 0.37 in the 10 h of light illumination. The enhanced PCE for the Pt/CuS cell may be due to the enhanced penetration of the electrolyte through the complete thickness of the electrode, activation of the entire electrode, or improved ionic transport, which arose from heating of the electrolyte.60
 Fig. 11  Stability test. Comparison of J–V photovoltaic parameters varying with aging time for the QDSSC assembled with Pt and Pt/CuS CEs: (a) Voc, (b) Jsc, (c) efficiency, and (d) fill factor. 
The better photovoltaic performance of the Pt/CuS CE is attributed to the improved photovoltaic properties and light harvesting at high wavelength due to (i) the increase in sulfur atomic percentage, which increased Cu vacancies and enhanced electrical conductivity, enabling a better reduction rate of the electrolyte, and (ii) complete coverage of the Pt with CuS, which would lead to strong adhesion and strengthen the electron extraction towards the electrolyte. CuS ions on the Pt surface can also significantly affect the surface properties, such as the surface morphology, roughness, and surface area.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated for the first time that metal sulfides coated on the surface of Pt films can be used as CEs in QDSSCs. We obtained a comprehensive comparison between the bare Pt and hybrid CEs, which showed that the Pt/CuS CE can be considered as an efficient and stable CE in QDSSCs. This is due to its large surface area and low electron transfer resistance toward the aqueous polysulfide electrolyte. The detailed characterization and experimental results show that the surface-modified Pt CEs are more advantageous for improving electrocatalytic and photocatalytic activities toward the reduction of the polysulfide electrolyte than Pt due to the lower charge transfer rate. The conductivity is amplified with CuS deposition on Pt, which produced very low RCE (37.01 Ω) and Rct (11.51 Ω) values. QDSSCs with the Pt/CuS CE produce an impressive PCE of 4.32% with a Voc of 0.60 V, an FF of 0.46, and a Jsc of 15.31 mA cm−2. This PCE is significantly higher than the values of 1.77%, 3.25%, and 2.95% obtained with the bare Pt, Pt/NiS, and Pt/CoS CEs. We anticipate that a PCE exceeding 7–8% can be achieved for QDSSCs through further optimization of the hybrid CE by controlling the CuS and Pt thickness, elemental composition, fabrication techniques, and morphology, which is in progress in our laboratory.
