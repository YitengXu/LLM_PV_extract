    , Accepted 18th January 2018First published on 19th January 2018AbstractTwo zinc porphyrins, 2 and 8, have been synthesized. Porphyrin 8 displays better electronic communication between the dye and the TiO2 electrode. Photophysical measurements and electrochemistry experiments suggest that both porphyrins are very promising sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). It was found that their molecular orbital energy levels favor electron injection and dye regeneration in DSSCs. Solar cells sensitized by 2 and 8 were fabricated, and it was found that they show power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 5.27% and 7.13%, respectively. Photovoltaic measurements (J–V curves) together with the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency spectra of the two cells reveal that the higher PCE value of the DSSC based on 8 is ascribed to the higher short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and dye loading values. Moreover, the larger charge recombination resistance, longer electron lifetime and shorter electron transport time for 8 also confirm the higher value of the Voc and the Jsc and the FF for the DSSC based on 8.
Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted a lot of attention among different types of third generation photovoltaic technologies due to their low cost, high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), and easy device fabrication, since it was first reported in 1991.1–3 A typical DSSC is composed of a wide band gap metal oxide (TiO2 or ZnO) film deposited on a transparent conducting substrate, a photosensitive dye, an electrolyte containing iodide and triiodide ions, and a counter electrode. Although each component in the DSSC has a significant role in photovoltaic performance, the photo-sensitizer plays an important role in light harvesting ability as well as in the photo-induced charge separation at electron injection from the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.4,5 DSSCs based on ruthenium(II)–polypyridyl complex sensitizers showed a significant improvement in efficiency from 7.12% for a homoleptic dye to 11.8% by the advent of panchromatic heteroleptic structures.6–8 However, their practical applications are limited owing to their high cost and environmental reasons. In addition to ruthenium based dyes, metal free dyes9–13 and porphyrin dyes14–19 have also been explored as sensitizers for DSSCs and exhibit impressive PCEs. Porphyrin-based dyes have been proved to be potential candidates for the use in DSSCs due to their intrinsic advantages of strong absorption coefficients in the visible region20 and multivarious positions available for functionalization, which result in readily tunable optical, photophysical and electrochemical properties of porphyrins.21–33 Most of the porphyrin sensitizers used for DSSCs exhibit a donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) type structure21,34–36 and showed the highest PCE for DSSCs so far.37 Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of two novel porphyrin sensitizers 2 and 8, as shown in Chart 1. The photovoltaic performance of both chromophores 2 and 8 was monitored, resulting in PCE values of 5.27 and 7.13%, respectively. The higher PCE for the DSSC based on 8 compared to the 2 counterpart is attributed to the suppressed recombination between the injected electrons from the excited state of the dye and either the ground state of the dye or redox couple in the electrolyte as confirmed from the EIS spectra of the DSSCs.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The structures of the two zinc porphyrin derivatives are shown in Chart 1.
The synthesis of Zn porphyrin 2 is illustrated in Scheme 1. Free base 1, previously described in our laboratory,38 was metalated with Zn(OAc)2 to provide zinc porphyrin. The structure of this compound 2 was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy by the disappearance of a broad peak at −2.54 ppm (assigned to the inner NH of the porphyrin macroring), by UV-visible and by HRMS (see the ESI†).

Nitroporphyrin 339 was reduced by following an adapted method40 with zinc powder and calcium chloride. This step of the reaction sequence proceeded smoothly and efficiently to give a good yield of the product compared to conventional methods with SnCl2 and HCl.41,42 Amino porphyrin 4 was then acylated, under dry conditions, with bromoacetyl chloride in the presence of DIPEA to yield amide derivative 5. The use of a bulky amine (DIPEA) was preferred to NEt3 because we previously observed a side substitution of the bromine atom by NEt3.43 The coupling of amide porphyrin 5 with DOA3tBu was performed via a nucleophilic substitution. The formation of porphyrin DOTA 6 was clearly demonstrated by MS (MALDI-TOF) with the presence of characteristic patterns corresponding to [M + Na]+ at m/z = 1206.49 (see S8, ESI†). Ligand 7 was finally obtained by deprotection of tBu-ester moieties, in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid in DCM. The bimetallic complex 8 was obtained with 2 equivalents of Zn(OAc)2. The coordination of zinc is widespread for a porphyrin but a little less for a DOTA macrocycle.44 The calculated mass of the bis-zinc porphyrin–DOTA derivative 8 is equal to 1140.2724 Da (chemical formula: C60H54N9O7Zn2), agreeing well with the experimental value of 1140.2764 Da [M + H]+.
DSSC fabrication and characterization
Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (Pilkington TEC 7) was used as transparent conducting glass substrates for the preparation of photo-anodes and counter electrodes. These FTO substrates were first cleaned in an ultrasonic bath using detergent solution, acetone and isopropanol, sequentially for 15 min each and then dried. After this, the FTO substrates were immersed into a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 60 °C for 30 min and washed with water and acetone and sintered at 450 °C for 330 min. Subsequently a 10–12 μm thick layer of commercially available TiO2 paste (Solaronix) with an average particle diameter of 20 nm was deposited onto the substrates by a screen printing method and sintered at 450 °C for 15 min. TiO2 deposited FTO substrates were again treated with 40 mM aqueous solution for 30 min and washed with acetone and again sintered at 450 °C for 20 min. The adsorption of the porphyrin dyes on TiO2 was carried out with 0.4 mM dye solution in THF/EtOH (1:4) containing 10 mM CDCA as a co-adsorbent for 12 hours at room temperature. The counter electrode was prepared by spin coating of H2PtCl4 solution (0.002 g in 1 mL i-PrOH) onto a pre-cleaned FTO coated glass substrate and then heating at 450 °C for 15 min in air. The sensitized working electrode was assembled with the Pt-coated FTO electrode into a sandwich type cell and sealed with a hot-melt polymer (Surlyn) as a spacer between the electrodes. To complete DSSC fabrication, the electrolyte composed of 0.3 M DMPII, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in CH3CN was introduced into the space between the two electrodes through a pre-drilled hole in the platinum-coated FTO by vacuum back-filling. The amount of dye loading was determined by dye desorption in a basic solution (0.1 M NaOH in THF/H2O = 1:1) followed by spectroscopic measurements. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSSCs under illumination were measured by a Keithley source meter, and a solar simulator coupled with a 150 W Xenon lamp and an AM optical filter were used to give 100 mW cm−2 illumination at the DSSC surface. The active area of the DSSCs was 0.20 cm2. Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) data were obtained as a function of different wavelengths using a Xenon lamp, a monochromator, and a Keithley source meter under constant illumination intensity at each wavelength. Intensity calibration for the IPCE data was performed using a standard silicon photodiode.
The current was measured under short circuit conditions. Electrochemical impedance (EI) spectra, in the dark, were recorded using an electrochemical workstation (Autolab PGSTAT) with a frequency response analyzer. A frequency range from 10 mHz to 100 kHz and an alternative current potential of 10 mV were used. A direct-current bias equivalent to the open-circuit voltage of the DSSC was applied. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data were analyzed using the Z-View software with an appropriate equivalent circuit.
Optical and electrochemical properties
The photophysical properties of 2 and 8 were investigated by UV-visible absorption spectra in solution and adsorbed onto the TiO2 films as shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively, and the optical data are summarized in Table 1. The UV-visible spectra (black color) in solution for both porphyrins exhibit a strong absorption band (Soret band) in the range of 400–450 nm followed by two Q-bands in the visible region of 500–650 nm which can be attributed to π–π* transition of the porphyrin core, which is the characteristics feature of Zn-porphyrins. The molar extinction coefficient of Soret bands is clearly higher than that of Q bands. As shown in Fig. 1a and b (red color), when both porphyrins are adsorbed onto the TiO2 film, the peaks were significantly broadened and red-shifted compared to the ones observed in solution. The extended absorption region, when absorbed onto the TiO2 surface, may be due to the intra- or intermolecular interaction between the porphyrin dye and TiO2, or due to both of them, which are favourable for harvesting light in the far-red and near-infrared regions.45

The emission properties of these dyes were also studied in solution (see Fig. S15, ESI†). Both compounds display usual zinc porphyrin fluorescence with two bands at 600 nm and 650 nm attributed to S1 → S0 transitions. Finally, the very good match between excitation and absorption spectra confirms that emission is originating from the porphyrin moiety as well as a fair solubility of the dyes in organic solvents. Using the onset absorption edge, λonset, of the Q band of the absorption spectra corresponding to the sensitizers absorbed onto TiO2, and the expression Egopt = 1240/λonset, the optical band gaps were found to be equal to 1.92 and 1.87 eV for 2 and 8, respectively.
In order to obtain information about the possibility of electron transfer from the excited state of porphyrin dyes to the conduction band of TiO2 and dye regeneration, we measured the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels by cyclic voltammetry of the dyes and are shown in Fig. 2. The oxidation peak and reduction potential are compiled in Table 2. The HOMO energy levels corresponding to the first oxidation potential for 2 and 8 are 0.80 V and 0.85 V vs. SCE, respectively. The oxidation potential for the I3−/I− redox couple is about 0.5 V vs. SCE. Also, the HOMO energy level of both porphyrin dyes is more positive than the oxidation potential of the redox couple, therefore, both the oxidized dye molecules can be regenerated by reducing species in the iodine electrolyte. Additionally, the LUMO energy level corresponding to the first reduction potential peak, at −1.40 and −1.32 V vs. SCE, for 2 and 8, respectively, is located more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. SCE). This implies an effective electron process from the excited dye to the conduction band of TiO2.

The energy diagram of porphyrins, TiO2 and redox electrolytes and electron injection and dye regeneration processes are shown in Fig. 3. Since both porphyrins consist of carboxylic anchoring groups, the binding of COOH/COO− groups with the TiO2 surface is also illustrated in Fig. 4.

Electrochemistry
The redox behavior of 1–2 and 7–8 has been investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). DMF was selected for electrochemical analyses since this solvent provides good solubility for these compounds. Table 1 shows the redox potentials (vs. SCE) extracted from the CVs (Fig. 2). As a general feature, the zinc(II) complexes (2, 8) exhibit two monoelectronic and reversible oxidation peaks. A third less reversible oxidation peak is observed at higher potential (1.37–1.45 V). In the negative potential direction, one reversible monoelectronic reduction peak is seen for 2 and 8, and other less reversible systems appear at a more negative potential. It is noteworthy that for the zinc(II) complexes, the HOMO–LUMO gaps estimated from the potential difference between the first oxidation and the first reduction are equal or very close to 2.20 V (Table 1). These values fall in line with the common diagnostic criterion reported for a purely macrocycle centered electron transfer (2.15 ± 0.15 V).46,47 Considering the free base compounds 1 and 7, redox systems are irreversible but their HOMO–LUMO gaps remain in the interval of the above-mentioned diagnostic criterion. Thus, the first electron transfer (Ox1 and Red1) still involves the porphyrin macrocycle. As the CV of 8 is almost superimposable, it could be concluded that the oxidation of DOTA complex 8 does not occur in this potential range. In agreement with this conclusion, benzoic acid has been reported to be reduced at ca. −2.25 V vs. Fc/Fc+ in acetonitrile containing 0.1 M TBAPF6 on a glassy carbon electrode.48 Acetic acid which should have a similar reduction potential compared to the carboxylic acid function(s) of 1, 2 and 7 is reduced at even more negative potentials, i.e. −2.36 V vs. Fc/Fc+ in acetonitrile containing 0.1 M TBAPF6 on a glassy carbon electrode.48 Considering these data, no carboxylic acid reduction could be observed on the CVs of 1, 2 and 7.
FTIR study
In order to obtain information about binding between the porphyrin dyes and the TiO2 surface, we have recorded the FTIR spectra of porphyrins and porphyrins adsorbed onto TiO2 films as shown in Fig. 5 (only for 8 and 8 adsorbed onto the TiO2 film). Similar spectra have been observed for porphyrin 2 and its adsorption onto the TiO2 film. Pristine 8 shows a strong absorption band at 1684 cm−1 attributed to ν(CO) stretching vibration. However, when 8 is adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface, this band completely disappears and two bands are clearly observed at 1628 cm−1 and 1438 cm−1. These are attributed to the carboxylate asymmetric νasym(–COO−) and symmetric νsym(–COO−) vibrations, respectively. This is an indication of strong binding of the porphyrin dye on the TiO2 surface through both of its carboxyl groups. For the determination of the binding mode of carboxylic acid groups onto the TiO2 surface, the difference between νasym(–COO−) and νsym(–COO−) was calculated and it was found to be 208 cm−1 and 190 cm−1 for 2 and 8, respectively, suggesting that carboxyl groups are bound to the TiO2 surface using a bridging bidentate mode. The smaller values for 8 compared to 2 indicate stronger binding between 8 and TiO2.

Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs based on 2 and 8 under illumination (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) was investigated using the electrolyte consisting of 0.3 M DMPII, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-TBP in acetonitrile. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics (under illumination) of the DSSCs sensitized with porphyrins 2 and 8 are shown in Fig. 6a and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2.
The DSSC sensitized with 2 showed an overall PCE of 5.27% with a Jsc of 12.29 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.64 V and a FF of 0.67. When 8 is used as a sensitizer, the DSSC exhibited a PCE of 7.13% with a Jsc of 14.78 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.67 V and a FF of 0.72. To obtain information about the difference in the photovoltaic response in the DSSCs based on 2 and 8 fabricated under identical conditions was further investigated by analyzing the difference between the Jsc values of DSSCs based on these two dyes and measuring the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of DSSCs as shown in Fig. 6b. As shown in IPCE spectra, both porphyrin dyes can effectively convert light to photocurrent in the UV-visible region. The IPCE spectra of the DSSCs closely resembles the corresponding porphyrin sensitizer. The IPCE bands in the 400–450 nm wavelength region exhibit the peak value around 63% for both the porphyrin dyes, whereas the peak values of IPCE in the Q bands are higher for the DSSC sensitized with 2 compared to 8. Moreover, the decline in the IPCE spectrum at a wavelength of around 508 nm is shallow for 8 with a higher valley value relative to 2. The IPCE spectrum of 8 is broader compared to 2, which leads to a significantly high value of Jsc. The integrated value of Jsc, estimated from the IPCE spectrum is about 12.16 mA cm−2 and 14.64 mA cm−2 for 2 and 8, respectively, consistent with the values observed in the experimental J–V characteristics. To obtain more information on high Jsc and IPCE values, the light harvesting ability was evaluated by measuring the transmittance spectra of the TiO2 film (8 μm) sensitized in a 0.2 mM solution of the porphyrin dye. The light harvesting efficiency (LHE) spectra are shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 7, compound 8 adsorbed on TiO2 exhibits larger LHE of about more than 90% broadly covering the entire region from 400 to 650 nm, whereas dye 2 adsorbed on TiO2 ranges from 400 to 630 nm.

 Fig. 7  LHE spectra of dye-loaded TiO2 films (with porphyrins 2 and 8). 
As can be seen from Fig. 7, sensitized 8 TiO2 displayed higher LHE compared to counterpart 2, resulting in high IPCE and Jsc values.49–51 The Jsc values estimated from the integration of IPCE spectra of the DSSCs are about 12.05 mA cm−2 and 14.53 mA cm−2, for 2 and 8, respectively, and closely resembles the values observed in their respective J–V characteristics. In general, LHE enhancement can be achieved by either increasing the dye loading or molar extinction coefficient.52 The amount of dye loading was measured by UV-visible absorption spectra of dye detached from the sensitized TiO2 (8 μm) film. The values of dye loading are 2.75 × 10−7 mol cm−2 and 2.63 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for 8 and 2, respectively, since there is a slight change in the dye loading for 8 compared to 2. The high LHE of 8 loaded TiO2 may originate from strong light absorbing ability of individual molecules rather than the dye loading amount and further demonstrate the significance of molar absorptivity. In addition to molar extinction coefficient another physical parameter is the total area of the Q-absorption band (integration of the Q-band) and is estimated as , where ε is the molar extinction coefficient and ν is the wave number. The values of  for 8 and 2 are about 38.6 × 106 M−1 cm−1 and 24.5 × 106 M−1 cm−1, respectively. To obtain information about the charge transfer process and recombination dynamics in the DSSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in the dark and also the interfacial charge recombination resistances (Rcr), effective chemical capacitance (Cμ) and electron lifetimes (τn) were measured.53,54 The applied voltage is around −0.7 V and was scanned from 105 to 0.1 Hz. The Nyquist and EIS plots of the DSSCs are shown in Fig. 8a.
 Fig. 8  (a) Nyquist plots and (b) Bode phase plots of DSSCs based on porphyrin dyes 2 and 8. 
In general, these plots consist of three semicircles that are associated with charge transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface (the high frequency region), electron transfer kinetics at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (middle frequency region) and Nernstian diffusion of I−/I3− in the electrolyte (low frequency region).55 As can be seen from Fig. 8a the radius of the semicircle of the Nyquist plots in the high frequency region is larger for DSSCs based on 8 than that of DSSCs based on 2, indicating that the resistance of charge transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface (Rce) is larger for 8 compared to 256,57 and this could be attributed to the different distribution and velocity of the electrolyte i.e. I− and I3− in the inter-space of the dye with a diversified molecular geometry and intermolecular packing on TiO2. The large semicircle observed in the middle frequency represents the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface and is inversely proportional to the rate of recombination. The radius of this circle is larger for 8 compared to that for 2 indicating an increase in Rrec thereby suppressing the recombination rate. Moreover, the lower value of Cμ for 8 (41 μF cm−2) than 2 (32 μF cm−2) suggests a positive shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge. In addition, τn can be estimated from the peak frequency (fmax) in the lower frequency region from the Bode phase plots (Fig. 8b) of the DSSCs, according to the expression τn = 1/(2πfmax) and the values of τn are 18.23 ms and 26.4 ms for 2 and 8, respectively. The values of Rrec and τn for 8 are higher compared to 2, indicating charge transfer from TiO2 back to the oxidized dye and the redox couple is slower in 8 sensitized DSSCs than in 2. These observed contradictory sequences (positive shift in TiO2 leads to a decrease in Voc) reveal that the relatively high Voc for 8 sensitized DSSCs is attributed to the suppressed charge recombination rather than the shift in the conduction band of TiO2. The higher values of Rrec and τn for 8 sensitized DSSCs indicate that greater values of Jsc and PCE of 2 based DSSCs may arise from the considerably suppressed charge recombination.
We have also measured the charge transfer resistance (Rtr) for both the DSSCs from the Nyquist and EIS plots under illumination and the values are 25.14 Ω cm2 and 21.05 Ω cm2 for 2 and 8 based DSSCs, respectively. Electron transfer resistance (Rtr) and charge recombination resistance (Rrec) of a solar cell are related to τν and the electron transport time (τδ) (which is a measure of average time taken by the injected electron to the FTO electrode) according to the relationship:58,59  The ηcc value for DSSCs sensitized with 8 (65%) was found to be higher than that of (52%) counterpart 2 and ultimately this leads to improved Jsc and PCE values. It can be seen from the IPCE spectra (Fig. 6b) that the values of IPCE for the DSSC sensitized with 8 are higher than counterpart 2, particularly in the Q-bands. The IPCE of the DSSC is the product of LHE, electron injection efficiency from the dye excited state to the conduction band of TiO2 (ϕinj) and ηcc, and is described as:IPCE(λ) = LHE × ϕinj × ηccAs discussed earlier LHE is higher for DSSCs sensitized with 8 compared to 2. ϕιnj in the DSSC, depends upon the energy difference between the LUMO of the dye and the conduction band of TiO2. As can be seen from the energy band diagram (Fig. 3) this difference is very small for these DSSCs, we can assume that the electron injection efficiency is almost the same for both DSSCs, but the LHE is more for 8 based DSSCs, we can assume that the more electron was injected from the excited state of 8 into the conduction band of TiO2. The value of ηcc for 8 based DSSCs is higher than that for counterpart 2, resulting in the improved values of IPCE for former DSSC.
Conclusions
The synthesis and characterization of two new porphyrin dyes (2 and 8) and their use as sensitizers for the fabrication DSSCs are reported. The photophysical and electrochemical measurements of 2 and 8 reveal that they possess suitable energy levels for efficient electron injection and regeneration processes when used as sensitizers for DSSCs. The 2 and 8-based solar cells were both fabricated and gave PCE values of 5.27% and 7.13%, respectively. As demonstrated by the J–V curves, IPCE and EIS of both DSSCs, the higher PCE value of the DSSC sensitized by 8 can be attributed to its enhanced short circuit current (Jsc) under illumination, its longer electron lifetime (tn), higher charge recombination resistance (Rrec) and more efficient charge collection.

DMF was of HPLC grade (Prolabo) and was distilled over CaH2 under Ar. Tetra-n-butylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) was synthesized by mixing stoichiometric amounts of tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide (Alfa-Aesar, 40% w/w aq. solution) and hexafluorophosphoric acid (Alfa-Aesar, ca. 60% w/w aq. solution). After filtration, the salt was recrystallized three times in ethanol and dried at 110 °C for at least 2 days. Electrochemical measurements were performed in DMF under an Ar atmosphere in a three-electrode glass cell. The working electrode (WE) was a glassy carbon (GC) disk with a surface area of about 0.07 cm2. Pt wire was used as a counter electrode (CE). Saturated aqueous calomel (SCE) was used as a reference electrode (RE). The RE was separated from the WE compartment by a double frit comprising an intermediate background solution (0.1 M TBAPF6 + DMF). All the potentials in this manuscript are indicated vs. SCE. Under these conditions, when operating in DMF (0.1 M TBAPF6), the formal potential for the Fc+/Fc couple was found to be +0.44 V vs. SCE. All the electrochemical studies were performed using Autolab PGSTAT 302N potentiostat. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. E1/2 = (Epa + Epc)/2 is given in Table 1 unless the redox system is irreversible. In this case, only the measurable peak potential is given.
