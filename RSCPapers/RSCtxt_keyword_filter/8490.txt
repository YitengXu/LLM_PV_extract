    , Accepted 18th January 2022First published on 18th January 2022AbstractIn recent years, atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) have demonstrated fascinating applicability in solar energy conversion due to their unique atomic stacking arrangements, quantum size effect and abundant active sites. Nevertheless, ultra-short carrier lifetimes and poor stabilities impede the construction of robust metal-NC-based photosystems. Herein, positively charged poly(diallyl-dimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) and tailor-made negatively charged L-glutathione (GSH)-capped Agx@GSH [Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 and Ag31(SG)19] NCs are used as building blocks and alternately deposited on a one-dimensional wide-band-gap metal oxide (MO) substrate using a facile and general layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly strategy to design a highly efficient spatially directional charge transport pathway in multilayered photoanodes. The electrons photoexcited from the periodically stacked Agx@GSH [Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 and Ag31(SG)19] NC layers concurrently and unidirectionally migrate to the MO substrate, while the ultrathin PDDA intermediate layer serves as an interfacial electron-withdrawing charge mediator to accelerate the transport of the carriers photoexcited over the neighboring Agx@GSH [Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 and Ag31(SG)19] NC layers. Benefiting from the charge transfer enhancement, these LbL-assembled multilayered MO/(PDDA/Agx NCs)n heterostructured photoanodes demonstrate significantly enhanced photoelectrochemical water oxidation performance under visible light irradiation due to the generation of unidirectional and spatially separated tandem charge transfer channels, which remarkably reduces the charge recombination and prolongs the carrier lifetime of the metal NCs. Moreover, we ascertain that this conceptual multilayered nanoarchitecture design and tandem charge transport are universal.
1. Introduction
Atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs, <2 nm) consisting of a definite number of ligands and metal atoms are an emerging subgenre of metal nanomaterials.1–3 Metal NCs feature molecule-like discrete energy band structures, peculiar atom-packing arrangements, quantum size effect and abundant active sites,4,5 which endow them with quasi-semiconductor properties such as a highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) transition gap, quantized charging, and strong luminescence,6–8 thereby diversifying the physicochemical properties of metal NCs for multifarious applications (e.g., energy storage and catalysis).9,10 In recent years, metal-NC-based photosystems have been sporadically reported, wherein the metal NCs serve as photosensitizers to extend the light absorption of wide-band-gap semiconductors (WBSs) to the visible region, accompanied by directional electron transfer from the LUMO level of the metal NCs to the conduction band (CB) of the WBS under simulated solar or visible light irradiation.11
Among the many metal NCs, gold (Aux) NCs have been extensively synthesized with clearly determined structure configurations.12 Compared to Aux NCs, silver (Agx) NCs, as the relatively inexpensive cousin of Aux NCs, demonstrate fascinating physicochemical properties.13,14 For example, the optical density of Agx NCs is substantially greater than that of Aux NCs, and moreover, Agx NCs exhibit greater extinction coefficients for visible- and UV-light absorption.15–17 In this regard, Agx NCs have recently garnered enduring interest in multidisciplinary fields including luminescence,18 imaging, and catalysis.19,20 However, the inherent poor stability and low photosensitization efficiency of Agx NCs are still the main obstacles limiting their widespread application in solar-powered photocatalysis. Optimizing the photosensitization efficiency and photostability of Agx NCs is heavily dependent on fine interface modulation between the Agx NCs and semiconductors.4,21–23 Nonetheless, prolonging the carrier lifetime of Agx NCs and mediating the vectorial charge transfer pathways of Agx NCs via controllable interface configuration modulation at the nanoscale level remain challenging tasks.
Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly utilizes the electrostatic interaction as the driving force to precisely control the integration of building blocks into complex multilayered nanostructures with diverse functionalities.24–29 In this technique, polyelectrolytes (PEs) with positive or negative ionizable groups are generally utilized to afford charged surfaces on the substrates.30,31 It was reported that PEs coated on a semiconductor surface are able to foster interfacial charge separation/migration,32 making them unexpected charge mediators to stimulate photoredox catalysis. Our previous work on solid-state non-conjugated polymers has indicated that the solar-to-current conversion efficiency of semiconductors can be significantly improved by judiciously harnessing PEs as the intermediate charge mediator to craft unidirectional vectorial charge transport pathways in photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells.33 In this case, the PEs not only act as a molecular binder to enable LbL assembly, but also facilitate enhanced charge transfer without causing detrimental defects.34–37 This inspired us to rationally design tunable charge transport pathways between atomically precise metal NCs and semiconductors in heterostructured photoelectrodes for PEC water splitting with the assistance of PEs. We speculate that a positively charged PE layer could be utilized as a building block for LbL assembly with negatively charged metal NCs to construct multilayered photoelectrodes with adjustable interfaces controlled by the assembly sequence and number of layers, in which periodically stacked ultrathin PE interim layers would enable the effective extraction of the electrons photoexcited over the neighboring metal NC layers to the WBS substrate in a tandem charge flow manner, thus substantially reinforcing the charge separation and prolonging the charge lifetime of the metal NCs.
Herein, spatially multilayered WBS/(PEs/metal NCs)n heterostructured photoanodes are elaborately designed using a facile and general LbL assembly strategy under ambient conditions, which affords a regulated vectorial charge transport channel. In this well-defined nanoarchitecture, positively charged poly(diallyl-dimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) and tailor-made intrinsically negatively charged glutathione (GSH)-capped Agx@GSH [Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 and Ag31(SG)19] NCs are alternately deposited on TiO2 nanorod arrays (TNRAs) to design the directional charge transport channel. The flexible integration mode between the ultrathin PDDA interim layer and the Agx NC layers endows the TNRAs/(PDDA–Agx NCs)n [T(PA)n] multilayered heterostructures with considerably enhanced PEC water oxidation performances under visible light irradiation. In these devices, the atomically precise Agx NCs function as photosensitizers and the periodically intercalated ultra-thin PDDA interim layer concurrently acts as a molecular binder and electron-withdrawing mediator, which synergistically results in a tandem electron transport channel and accelerates the charge separation over the Agx NCs. We anticipate that our work will provide an emerging platform to create diverse metal-NC-based photosystems, and more importantly, unleash the unexpected charge transport mechanism of solid-state non-conjugated insulating polymers for solar energy conversion.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Preparation of TNRA substrate
The TNRAs were prepared using a hydrothermal method according to previous work.38 Detailed information on the synthesis procedures is provided in the ESI.†
2.2. Preparation of Agx NCs
Agx@GSH NCs were prepared based on a previous work.4 Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 and Ag31(SG)19 NCs were also prepared according to previous works.39,40 All the detailed information on the synthesis procedures is provided in the ESI.†
2.3. Preparation of TiO2/(PDDA–Agx NCs)n heterostructures
TNRAs were first immersed in a positively charged PDDA aqueous solution (0.5 mg mL−1, 0.5 M NaCl, pH = 10) for 5 min and then washed with deionized water (DI H2O) for 60 s. Subsequently, the PDDA-modified TNRAs were dipped into a negatively charged Agx@GSH [Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 or Ag31(SG)19] NC aqueous solution (0.19 mg mL−1, pH = 3.75) for 5 min, after which the samples were washed with DI H2O for 60 s and dried with N2. The above procedure was defined as one bi-layer, i.e., T(PA)1. The aforementioned procedures were repeated the desired number of times to obtain TNRAs/(PDDA–Agx NCs)n, i.e., T(PA)n, multilayered photoanodes. Multilayered TNRAs/(Agx)4 (i.e., TA4) and TNRAs/(PDDA)4 (i.e., TP4) counterparts were also prepared via a similar LbL assembly route, and the detailed synthesis procedures are provided in the ESI.†
2.4. Characterization
The crystal structure was determined using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Miniflex600) using Cu Kα as the radiation source under 40 kV and 15 mA. Zeta potential (ε) results were measured using dynamic light scattering analysis (Zeta sizer Nano ZS-90) at room temperature (298 K). Morphologies were explored using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Supra55). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were collected using a transmission electron microscope. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS, Cary50, Varian, America) were obtained using BaSO4 as the reflectance background over the range from 200 to 800 nm. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using an infrared spectrophotometer (Tianjin, China). Raman measurements were carried out using Raman spectroscopy (Dxr-2xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) with an extended scan range of 0–3000 cm−1. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were collected using a Varian Cary Eclipse spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded using a photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250) with the binding energies calibrated to 284.80 eV.
2.5. PEC water oxidation measurements
PEC water oxidation performances were measured using a three-electrode cell connected to an electrochemical workstation (CHI660E, CHI Shanghai, Inc.) with Na2SO4 (0.5 M, pH = 6.69) as the electrolyte. TNRAs, T(PA)n (n = 1, 2, 4, 8), TNRAs/(PDDA)4 (i.e., TP4) and TNRAs/(Agx)4 (i.e., TA4) were utilized as the photoanodes with a Pt sheet and Ag/AgCl electrode as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The PEC water splitting performances of the photoanodes were evaluated under visible light irradiation provided by a 300 W Xe lamp with a band-pass light filter (λ > 420 nm). The potential of the electrode was calibrated against the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) according to the following formula:ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059pH + EAg/AgCl0 (EAg/AgCl0 = 0.197 V at 25 °C)(1)
3. Results and discussion
As shown in Scheme 1, the TNRA substrate was prepared using a hydrothermal method, and T(PA)n ternary multilayered photoanodes were then progressively constructed via a LbL assembly strategy. More specifically, the negatively charged TNRA (Fig. S1a†) substrate was first immersed into a positively charged PDDA aqueous solution (Fig. S2†), which rendered TNRAs with a positively charged surface (Fig. S1b†), thus forming the TNRAs/PDDA (TP) nanocomposite. Noteworthily, atomically precise Agx NCs feature a negatively charged surface (Fig. S1c†) owing to the deprotonation of the carboxyl groups on the GSH ligands (Fig. S3†) capped on the Agx NC surface. Subsequently, the T(PA)1 nanocomposite was prepared by dipping a TP substrate into a tailor-made Agx NC aqueous solution, causing the ultra-small negatively charged Agx NCs to spontaneously and uniformly assemble on the positively charged TP under the pronounced electrostatic attractive force. In an analogous way, T(PA)n (n = 1, 2, 4, 8) multi-layered heterostructures were constructed via the alternate deposition of PDDA and Agx NCs on the TNRA framework to achieve the desired number of bilayers.

3.1. Characterization of composite photoanodes
Characterization of the Agx@GSH NCs is provided in Fig. 1a–c, and reveal its ultra-small size (ca. 1.99 nm), intrinsically negatively charged surface, and substantial visible light absorption, rendering it applicable as a light-harvesting antenna for PEC water oxidation. To reveal the composition and crystal structure of the samples, the XRD results for TNRAs, TP4, TA4 and T(PA)4 were explored and are presented in Fig. 1d, wherein all these samples show almost identical diffraction peaks. The peaks at 36.6° and 63.3° were assigned to the (101) and (002) crystal planes of rutile TiO2 (JCPDS: 88-1174). However, peaks attributable to Agx NCs were not observed in the XRD patterns of the composite photoanodes, probably due to the very low loading amount of Agx NCs or the shielding of the main characteristic peaks of the Agx NCs by the peaks of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) or TNRAs from the substrate. The DRS results and bandgaps of the samples are displayed in Fig. 1e and f; all the samples show similar peaks in the wavelength region ranging from 300 to 420 nm due to the bandgap photoexcitation of the TNRA substrate. TP4 displays a peak almost identical to that of the TNRAs, which is attributed to the lack of light absorption by PDDA in the visible region (Fig. S4†). T(PA)4 and TA4 exhibit a slight red-shift in the absorption band edge compared to their other counterparts, which is ascribed to the photosensitization effect of the Agx NCs. Although the bandgaps of the binary and ternary photoanodes are almost unchanged with the deposition of PDDA and Agx NCs, the light absorption capacities of TA4 and T(PA)4 for visible light are still improved due to the photosensitization effect of the Agx NCs.

Fig. 1g and Table S1† present the FTIR spectra of the samples, in which the characteristic peaks at 2970 and 2930 cm−1 and 655 cm−1 are attributed to the stretching vibration mode of the –CH2 groups from the GSH ligand and asymmetric vibration mode of the Ti–O bond for TiO2,41 respectively. The Ti–O peak intensity in the spectrum of the TNRAs is greater than that of its counterparts due to the shielding effects of the PDDA and Agx NCs.42 In the FTIR spectrum of T(PA)4, the peak at 1642 cm−1 demonstrates a more substantial intensity than that in the spectrum of the TNRAs due to the overlapping vibration modes of the –OH and –CO groups from the GSH ligand,43 and the enhanced peak at 3440 cm−1 was assigned to the fingerprint stretching vibration mode of the surface –OH groups. The FTIR spectrum of T(PA)4 exhibits a new peak at 1110 cm−1 corresponding to the C–N bending vibration mode of the GSH ligand,44 which is not observed in the FTIR spectrum of the TNRAs. The differences between the FTIR spectra of T(PA)4 and the TNRAs implied that the Agx NCs and PDDA had been successfully deposited on the TNRA substrate via LbL assembly.
As shown in Fig. 1h, the Raman spectra of all the photoanodes show similar peaks at approximately 143 cm−1 (B1g), 230 cm−1 (two-phonon bands), 449 cm−1 (Eg) and 611 cm−1 (A1g),45 wherein the Eg and A1g vibration modes correspond to TiO2.46 Similarly, the peaks corresponding to the Agx NCs are not observed due to the low loading amount, which is in good agreement with the XRD results. Notably, T(PA)4 demonstrates the weakest peak intensity, which might be attributed to the shielding effects of the PDDA and Agx NCs. XPS analysis was conducted to clarify the elemental chemical states of the TNRAs and T(PA)4. As shown in Fig. 1i, Ti, C and O signals were visualized in the survey spectra of the TNRAs and T(PA)4, which stemmed from the TiO2 substrate. As displayed in the high-resolution Ti 2p (Fig. S5a†) and O 1s (Fig. 1j) spectra of the TNRAs and T(PA)4, the binding energies of the Ti 2p peaks correspond to the Ti4+ species,47,48 and the O 1s signals correspond to the Ti–O and Ti–OH species from the TiO2 substrate,49 respectively. Obviously, the binding energies of the elements Ti and O in T(PA)4 display apparent negative shifts of ca. 0.24 and 0.4 eV relative to those of the blank TNRAs, which might be ascribed to the electronic-interaction-induced charge transfer between the TNRAs and Agx NCs in the multilayered heterostructures. Fig. 1k displays the high-resolution N 1s spectra of T(PA)4, in which the peaks at 402.48 and 399.69 eV are attributed to the –NH4 and –NH2/–NH groups from PDDA.50 Fig. S5b and c† exhibit the high-resolution C 1s spectra of the TNRAs and T(PA)4, in which the TNRAs and T(PA)4 display two similar peaks at 284.8/284.8 eV and 286.32/286.16 eV stemming from C–C/C–H and C–OH species, respectively.51 As shown in Fig. S5c,† the new peak at 287.92 eV corresponds to the carboxyl (–COOH) groups from the GSH ligand of the Agx NCs.44Fig. 1l exhibits two peaks at 374 eV (Ag 3d5/2) and 368 eV (Ag 3d3/2) in the high-resolution Ag 3d spectrum of T(PA)4, wherein each peak demonstrates two valence states of metallic Ag(0) and Ag(I), stemming from the Ag(0)/Ag(I) core–shell structure of the Agx NCs.4 Therefore, the XPS results (Table S2†) prove the attachment of PDDA and Agx NCs on the TNRAs.
As shown in Fig. 2a and S6,† the blank TNRAs are characterized by nanorod-like structures with an average thickness of ca. 1.8 μm. Fig. 2b and c show the top-view and cross-sectional FESEM images of TA4 and T(PA)4, which exhibit almost the same morphology as the pristine TNRAs; the Agx NCs cannot be observed owing to their ultra-small size (ca. 1.99 nm, Fig. 1c). In the FESEM elemental mapping results of T(PA)4 (Fig. S7†), an N signal originating from PDDA and Ag and S signals from the Agx NCs are clearly observed; these results are in line with the XPS results, confirming the successful deposition of PDDA and Agx NCs on the TNRA substrate in the T(PA)4 heterostructure. Similar results are observed in the FESEM elemental mapping results of TA4 (Fig. S8†), which reflects the anchoring of Agx NCs on the TNRA substrate. The nanorod-like structure of T(PA)4 is also revealed in the TEM image (Fig. 2d), which is consistent with the FESEM results. As displayed in Fig. 2e and f, an ultra-thin PDDA layer (ca. 1 nm) is closely coated on the border of the TiO2 nanorods with Agx NCs uniformly deposited on the TNRA surface. The HRTEM image of the designated area exhibits the clear crystalline structure of the TNRAs with distinguishable lattice fringes of ca. 0.32 and 0.29 nm, which can be assigned to the (110) and (001) crystal facets of rutile TiO2, respectively.52 Moreover, the lattice spacing of the Agx NCs is not discerned in the HRTEM image of T(PA)4 (Fig. 2f) due to its unique atomic stacking mode and amorphous property, which is distinct from the conventional face-centered cubic structure of metal nanocrystals. The element distribution patterns of T(PA)4 were explored using the TEM elemental mapping results. As displayed in Fig. 2g–l, uniform distribution patterns of the elements Ti, O, Ag, S, and N on the TNRAs are clearly seen, among which the Ag and S are from the Agx NCs and GSH ligands, N is from the ultra-thin PDDA layer, and Ti and O are from the TNRA substrate, strongly corroborating the monodisperse attachment of an ultra-thin PDDA layer and Agx NCs on the TNRA framework. Therefore, the TEM images manifest that multilayered T(PA)4 heterostructures consisting of ultrathin PDDA layers and Agx NCs periodically deposited on the surface of TNRAs were effectively fabricated via LbL assembly.

3.2. PEC water oxidation performances
The effect of the synergistic interaction between the ultra-thin PDDA layer and atomically precise Agx NCs on the interfacial charge transfer efficiency of the multilayered photoanode was systematically explored via their PEC water oxidation performances. First, the effect of the loading amount of the Agx NCs on the PEC water splitting performance of T(PA)4 was probed by adjusting the assembly number. As shown in Fig. S9,† T(PA)4 exhibits the optimal photocurrent density compared to the other counterparts under visible light irradiation because the over-deposition of Agx NCs and PDDA on the TNRA substrate would cause the unfavorable agglomeration of NCs, thus affecting the light absorption and impeding efficient charge transport. Therefore, T(PA)n with four assembly bilayers was utilized as the optimal sample for the following systematic investigations.

Fig. 3a presents the applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) values calculated from the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) results according to the following formula: η = I0(1.23 − |V|)/Jp(2)where V and I0 correspond to the applied potential (V vs. RHE) and photocurrent density, and Jp is the light intensity. It is apparent that T(PA)4 exhibits the best ABPE among all the samples; the ABPEs of the samples followed the order T(PA)4 > TA4 > TP4 > TNRAs. The significantly improved ABPE of T(PA)4 in comparison with its single-component (TNRAs) and binary (TA4, TP4) counterparts implies the cooperative synergy of the Agx NCs and the ultra-thin PDDA intermediate layers to provide concurrent photosensitization and electron-withdrawing effects, respectively. Therefore, the ABPE results strongly reveal the crucial roles of the PDDA and Agx NCs as well as their synergistic effects in enhancing the PEC water oxidation performance of the T(PA)4 multilayered photoanode. As shown in Fig. 3b, the on–off transient photocurrent responses of the TNRAs, TP4, TA4, and T(PA)4 were measured under intermittent visible light irradiation. Consistently, T(PA)4 exhibited the best photocurrent compared with its other counterparts; its photocurrent was three times larger than those of TA4 and TP4, and the photocurrents followed the order T(PA)4 > TA4 > TP4 > TNRAs, which is consistent with the ABPE results. Apparently, the unique multilayered nanostructure afforded by LbL assembly, with the alternate deposition of ultrathin PDDA layers and atomically precise Agx NCs on the TNRA substrate, plays a crucial role in promoting the electron migration, thus improving the photocurrent density, while the ultrathin PDDA intermediate layers and atomically precise Agx NCs act as charge transfer mediators and photosensitizers, respectively.
 Fig. 3  (a) ABPE results, (b) transient photocurrent responses (I–t) (bias: 1.0 V vs. RHE), (c) EIS results (frequency: 0.1–105 Hz), (d) Mott–Schottky plots and (e) charge carrier densities, (f) open circuit photovoltage decay (OCVD) and (g) electron lifetime, (h) and (i) IPCE spectra of TNRAs, TP4, TA4 and T(PA)4. All measurements were performed using Na2SO4 aqueous solution (0.5 M, pH = 6.69) as the electrolyte under visible light irradiation (λ > 420 nm). 
With the aim of evaluating the interfacial charge transfer resistance between the photoelectrodes and the electrolyte, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were conducted under visible light irradiation. The semicircle arc diameter of Nyquist plots provide rich information on interfacial charge transport dynamics, that is, smaller semicircle arc diameter corresponds to lower charge transfer resistance, and thus more efficient charge separation efficiency.53 As shown in Fig. 3c, T(PA)4 demonstrates a smaller semicircle arc radius compared with those of the TNRAs, TP4 and TA4, indicating that the alternate self-assembly of ultra-thin PDDA layers and Agx NCs on the TNRAs enhances the interfacial charge transfer efficiency. Table S3† summarizes the fitted EIS results of the photoanodes under visible light irradiation based on an equivalent circuit, among which T(PA)4 shows a smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 4098 ohm relative to TA4 (6581 ohm), TP4 (10970 ohm) and TNRAs (12480 ohm), revealing the cooperativity among the TNRAs, PDDA and Agx NCs in reducing interfacial charge transport resistance and thus improving interfacial charge transport. It should be particularly noted that the EIS results of these photoanodes follow the same order as the ABPE and I–t results.

Fig. 3d presents the Mott–Schottky (M–S) results of the TNRAs, TP4, TA4 and T(PA)4, in which it is clearly seen that the slope of the linear part of the M–S plots is positive, indicating typical n-type semiconductor behavior. Additionally, the charge carrier densities (ND) of the photoanodes were calculated using the following formula: (3)where ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum (8.86 × 10−12 F m−1), e is the charge of a single electron (1.6 × 10−19 C), εr is the dielectric constant (170), Us is the applied potential, and C is the capacitance. Fig. 3e presents the calculated charge carrier densities of the different photoanodes; as shown, the ND values of the TNRAs, TP4, TA4 and T(PA)4 were determined to be 1.51 × 1018, 2.31 × 1018, 3.46 × 1018, and 5.20 × 1018 cm−3, respectively. These results confirm that T(PA)4 demonstrates the best carrier density and charge separation efficiency compared to its other counterparts.
The charge recombination kinetics of the photoanodes were analyzed using their open-circuit photovoltage decay (OCVD) curves, which are generally utilized to evaluate the charge recombination dynamics and lifetime of photoelectrons. The relationship between VOC and electron lifetime can be described by the equation below: (4)where kB is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, e is the electron charge, and VOC is the open-circuit voltage at time t. Fig. 3f displays the continuous monitoring of VOC starting from the steady state under visible light irradiation followed by the decay of VOC upon switching off the light irradiation; T(PA)4 shows a higher photovoltage than the TNRAs, TP4 and TA4. Fig. 3g demonstrates the corresponding electron lifetime; T(PA)4 exhibits the longest electron lifetime compared to its other counterparts. This reveals that ultrathin PDDA layer encapsulation in conjunction with Agx NC deposition on the TNRA substrate is beneficial for constructing continuous electron transfer channels in T(PA)4, which accelerates the interfacial charge separation and prolongs the charge lifetime.
The incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) indicates the efficiency of the photoelectrode to convert photons into photocurrent under monochromatic light irradiation, and can be calculated using the equation below: (5)where I and Jlight are the photocurrent density (mA cm−2) and incident light intensity (mW cm−2), respectively, and λ is the incident light wavelength (nm). As displayed in Fig. 3h and i, all the samples demonstrate an obvious peak in the IPCE results, which stemmed from the bandgap photoexcitation of the TiO2 substrate, consistent with the corresponding DRS results. Specifically, both TP4 and TA4 demonstrate enhanced IPCEs compared to the TNRAs, and the light absorption band edge of the former was unchanged, while that of the latter shows a slight red-shift relative to that of the TNRAs. The IPCE result of TP4 indicates that PDDA fails to alter the light absorption of the composite photoanodes owing to its lack of light absorption. Comparing the IPCE result of TA4 with that of the TNRAs corroborates the intrinsic photosensitization effect of the Agx NCs, which is reflected by the markedly enhanced light absorption in the wavelength profile range of 450 nm to 600 nm. T(PA)4 exhibits a superior IPCE compared to its TNRA, TP4 and TA4 counterparts, which is ascribed to the synergy of the atomically precise Agx NCs in extending the visible light absorption and the ultrathin PDDA layers in facilitating the directional electron transfer from the Agx NCs to the TNRAs. These IPCE results agree well with the other PEC results, once again confirming the superiority of the synergistic effect of PDDA and Agx NCs.
It has been well established that photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is an efficacious tool to probe interfacial charge transfer and separation efficiency. Fig. 4a displays the PL spectra of the TNRAs, TP4, TA4, and T(PA)4, in which the peak at ca. 412 nm is attributed to the recombination of free electrons, the peak at 440–500 nm corresponds to the excitonic PL caused by defects and surface oxygen vacancies of the TNRAs, the two small peaks at ca. 482 and 493 nm are caused by the bound excitons, and the peaks at 452 and 469 nm result from the band edge free excitons.25 T(PA)4 clearly demonstrates the lowest PL density compared to those of its corresponding single-component and binary counterparts, indicating that it has the lowest carrier recombination rate, which is also in agreement with its optimal PEC water oxidation performance. Noteworthily, the PL results of the samples agree well with the PEC water splitting performance results.

The influence of the interfacial interaction between the ultra-thin PDDA layer and the atomically precise Agx NCs on the PEC water oxidation performance of the multilayered photoanodes was explored by constructing photoanodes with different stacking modes and interface configurations. As displayed in Fig. 4b, the T(AP)4 photoanode was constructed by the alternate deposition of Agx NCs and PDDA on the TNRA surface with the reverse deposition sequence to T(PA)4. TP4A4 (Fig. 4c) and TA4P4 (Fig. 4d) photoanodes were also deliberately designed for systematic comparison; TP4A4 was prepared by depositing four ultra-thin PDDA layers on the TNRAs followed by depositing four Agx NCs layers, and TA4P4 was prepared by the self-assembly of four Agx NCs layers on the TNRAs followed by depositing four ultra-thin PDDA layers. In other words, TNRAs were coated with four PDDA layers or four Agx NCs layers, and then the other component was electrostatically assembled on the outermost surface. T(P + A)4 (Fig. 4e) was prepared by depositing four layers of a mixed solution containing equal amount of PDDA and Agx NCs on the TNRAs. As shown in Fig. 4b–f, T(PA)4 still exhibits the best photocurrent density compared with these other counterparts, which substantiates that alternately depositing ultra-thin PDDA layers and Agx NCs on the TNRA surface is indispensable for accelerating the interfacial charge transfer rate. Noteworthily, T(AP)4 was prepared without surface charge tuning between the TNRA surface and Agx NCs, which impedes the construction of favorable tandem charge transport pathways, thus reducing the electron transfer efficiency from the Agx NCs to the TNRAs. Similarly, TA4P4 exhibits an inferior photocurrent to that of T(PA)4, which is mainly attributed to the fact that the PDDA coated on the outermost surface cannot serve as an effective electron-withdrawing mediator owing to the ultra-long charge transport distance. Note that TP4A4 also exhibits an inferior photocurrent to that of T(PA)4, which might be caused by its inability to form cascade electron transport channels or the fact that the thickness of the PDDA layer is much larger than the electron mean free path. In summary, only in the T(PA)4 multilayered photoanode with ultra-thin PDDA layers and atomically precise Agx NCs alternately stacked on the TNRA surface can the electrons photoexcited over Agx NCs be effectively transported from the LUMO level to the PDDA layer with a thickness smaller than the mean free path of electrons. The PDDA layer then relays the electrons to the CB of the TNRAs via a tandem charge transport cascade, thus considerably reducing the charge recombination.
The photocurrent (JHPEC2O) of the PEC water splitting reaction can be expressed using the following formula: JHPEC2O = Jabs × ηinj × ηsep(6)where Jabs is the photocurrent with an internal quantum efficiency of 100% under 1 sun irradiation (Jabs = 1.8 mA cm−2 for rutile TiO2); ηinj and ηsep correspond to the efficiency of holes participating in the electrochemical reactions and the charge separation efficiency for yielding holes flowing to the surface, respectively. When (NH4)2C2O4·H2O was utilized as the hole scavenger in the electrolyte, the ηinj and ηsep of TNRAs and T(PA)4 could be calculated by the following formula: (7) (8)where J(NH4)2C2O4·H2O is the photocurrent of the photoanode with the addition of (NH4)2C2O4·H2O.

Fig. 4g reveals the LSV results of TNRAs and T(PA)4 with and without added (NH4)2C2O4·H2O, from which it is apparent that the photocurrents of TNRAs and T(PA)4 were increased after adding (NH4)2C2O4·H2O to the electrolyte. This was ascribed to the enhanced charge separation upon quenching the holes. As shown in Fig. 4h and i, the ηinj and ηsep of T(PA)4 are much larger than those of the TNRAs, which is ascribed to the crucial role of PDDA as a unidirectional electron transfer mediator for constructing cascade electron transport pathways to improve charge separation/migration over T(PA)4.
To evaluate the universality of the LbL assembly strategy in constructing cascade electron transport channels, atomically precise Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 and Ag31(SG)19 NCs were also utilized as building blocks for the LbL assembly of T(PAm)4 (m = 9, 16, 31) heterostructured photoanodes. Characterization data of Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 and Ag31(SG)19 NCs are provided in Fig. S10–S12.† It should be emphasized that according to the UV-vis absorption spectra, Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 and Ag31(SG)19 NCs exhibited substantial visible light absorption and their peaks at 450–500 nm increased with the number of Ag atoms, indicating that they are suitable photosensitizers for PEC water oxidation under visible light irradiation. Moreover, the zeta potential results confirmed that all these NCs had negatively charged surfaces due to the deprotonation of the carboxyl groups on the GSH ligands, rendering them applicable assembly units for the LbL assembly of T(PAm)4 multilayered heterostructures. As displayed in Fig. 5a–c, transient photocurrent responses of Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 and Ag31(SG)19 NC-photosensitized multilayered photoanodes under visible light irradiation were explored, among which T(PAm)4 still demonstrated the best PEC water oxidation activity relative to its single-component and binary counterparts under the same conditions. The results follow the order T(PAm)4 > T(Am)4 > TP4 > TNRAs, which is consistent with the aforementioned results obtained over Agx–NC-based multilayered photoanodes.

(j) Schematic diagram depicting the PEC water oxidation mechanism of the T(PA)4 multilayered heterostructured photoanode. 
As an important aspect of photoelectrodes, the photostability of T(PA)4 was explored under visible light irradiation. As shown in Fig. S13,† T(PA)4 demonstrates poor photostability, with the photocurrent rapidly decaying under visible light irradiation, which might be caused by the inactivation or dissolution of PDDA in the reaction, thus deconstructing the cascade electron transport pathway. Nevertheless, we speculate that PDDA, as a PE with an ultra-high molecular weight (20–30 kDa), cannot be decomposed by photoelectrons. To probe the origin of the poor photostability of T(PA)4, a series of control experiments were performed. Fig. S14† demonstrates that the photocurrent of T(PA)4 after immersion in the electrolyte (Na2SO4) for 60 min is equal to that of freshly prepared T(PA)4, suggesting that the PDDA and Agx NCs adhered to the TNRA surface are not dissolved in the electrolyte. Therefore, we believe that the substantial photocurrent decay of T(PA)4 is predominantly due to the instability of the Agx NCs during the reaction process. As displayed in Fig. S13,† the photostability of T(PA)4 was greatly improved after adding a superoxide radical scavenger (benzoquinone, C6H4O2) to the electrolyte, while other scavengers, such as a hole scavenger (sodium sulfite, Na2SO3) or an electron scavenger (potassium persulfate, K2S2O8), played no role in improving the photostability of T(PA)4. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Agx NCs are oxidized and then inactivated, mainly by superoxide radicals, which leads to the poor photostability of T(PA)4.
3.3. PEC water oxidation mechanism
To reveal the PEC water oxidation mechanism of T(PA)4, the energy band structures of the TNRAs and the different atomically precise metal NCs [Agx, Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 and Ag31(SG)19] were probed. The energy level position of the TNRAs is provided in Fig. S15,† and the CV results of the metal NCs [Agx, Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 and Ag31(SG)19] are shown in Fig. 5d–i and Table S4.† From these results, it is apparent that the TNRAs and metal NCs demonstrate favorable energy level alignment; that is, the LUMO potentials of the atomically precise metal NCs [Agx@GSH: −1.09 V; Ag9(SG)6: −1.76 V; Ag16(SG)9: −1.8 V; Ag31(SG)19: −1.53 V vs. NHE] were more negative than the CB of the TNRAs (−0.62 V vs. NHE). Hence, it is apparent that the CB levels of the TNRAs are below the LUMO levels of the Agx@GSH, Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 and Ag31(SG)19 NCs, which enables the electrons photoexcited over the Agx@GSH [Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 and Ag31(SG)19] NCs to spontaneously migrate to the TNRA substrate. Based on the above discussion, the PEC water oxidation mechanism of T(PA)4 is illustrated in Fig. 5j. Specifically, when the T(PA)4 photoanode is irradiated by visible light, the TNRA substrate is not photoexcited, but the Agx@GSH [Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 and Ag31(SG)19] NCs acting as photosensitizers are photoexcited to generate the electron–hole charge carriers. Considering the multilayered nanoarchitecture of T(PA)4, the ultrathin PDDA intermediate layer not only plays the role of a molecular binder by adjusting the surface charge properties of the substrate, but also acts as an efficient electron-withdrawing mediator to accelerate directional electron transport from the Agx@GSH [Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 and Ag31(SG)19] NCs to the TNRAs. The thus-formed cascade electron transport channel afforded by the multilayered heterostructure is beneficial for extracting the electrons photoexcited over the Agx@GSH [Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 and Ag31(SG)19] NCs and migrating them to the CB of the TNRAs more quickly, which remarkably reduces the charge recombination and results in significantly enhanced PEC water oxidation performance. Subsequently, the photoelectrons are transferred to the cathode along the external circuit to participate in reducing water to hydrogen, while the holes at the HOMO level of the Agx@GSH [Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 and Ag31(SG)19] NCs take part in the water oxidation reaction at the photoanode. Overall, the unique multilayered heterostructure of T(PA)4 constructed by alternately depositing ultra-thin PDDA layers and atomically precise Agx@GSH [Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 and Ag31(SG)19] NCs on the TNRA surface through LbL assembly not only reinforces the light absorption, but also markedly promotes the tandem charge transfer to enhance the PEC water oxidation activity.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we rationally designed novel T(PA)4 ternary multilayered photoanodes via an easily accessible, general and green LbL assembly approach, wherein ultra-thin PDDA layers and atomically precise Agx@GSH [Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 and Ag31(SG)19] NCs were alternately deposited as building blocks on TNRAs via electrostatic interaction. The interface configuration of these multilayered heterostructures is finely tuned by the assembly number and sequence at the nanoscale level. It was revealed that LbL-assembled T(PA)4 multilayered photoanodes show considerably enhanced PEC water oxidation performance under visible light irradiation relative to their single-component and binary counterparts, which is predominantly attributed to the pivotal role of the ultra-thin PDDA intermediate layer as an efficient electron-withdrawing mediator, the substantial photosensitization effect of the atomically precise Agx@GSH [Ag9(SG)6, Ag16(SG)9 and Ag31(SG)19] NCs, and their unique face-to-face integration mode, which synergistically result in a tandem charge transfer pathway. Moreover, we ascertained that the concept for constructing cascade charge transport channels is universal.
