    , Accepted 1st February 2023First published on 2nd February 2023AbstractFrom the perspective of resource renewability and environmental sustainability, hydrogel electrolytes based on naturally abundant cellulose are ideal materials for constructing flexible solid-state zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitors (ZHSCs) and novel electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices. However, the cellulose hydrogel electrolyte, which cannot possess high ionic conductivity and mechanical strength simultaneously, hinders the further application of this electrolyte in the field of ZHSCs. In this study, a high-performance cellulose hydrogel electrolyte was prepared by introducing bentonite (BT) nanoplatelets. The lamellar structure of BT nanoplatelets and coordination interaction between BT and cellulose were utilised to achieve a high ionic conductivity of 46.3 mS cm−1 at 25 °C and compressive strength of 2.93 MPa for the cellulose/BT-ZnSO4 hydrogel (CBH-Zn). The flexible solid-state ZHSC (CBH-ZHSC) possessed a maximum energy density of 97.4 W h kg−1 at a power density of 400 W kg−1 and capacity retention as high as 94% after 45000 cycles at a current density of 10.0 A g−1. Furthermore, the integrated system consisting of the CBH-ZHSC and solar cells successfully achieved energy conversion, storage, and utilisation. This strategy provides new insights into the application of cellulose hydrogel electrolytes in the field of flexible EES devices.
Introduction
With the rapid development of flexible wearable electronic devices, such as neotype green electrochemical energy storage (EES) devices, a desirable solid-state zinc-ion hybrid supercapacitor (ZHSC) is required to provide splendid safety, outstanding mechanical flexibility, high energy density, large power density, and long cycle life.1–4 The ZHSC is composed of a capacitor-type cathode, a battery-type anode, and an electrolyte, in which the electrolyte plays an important role in the migration of ions between the cathode and anode.5–7 The hydrogel electrolyte possesses preeminent safety, designability, and mechanical properties, which can promote the ZHSC to adapt to external forces and complex mechanical deformations without the problems of liquid leakage or significant impairment of electrochemical performance.8,9 Currently, biopolymers (such as cellulose, alginate, and chitosan) and synthetic polymers (polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylamide, and polyacrylic acid, for instance) have been extensively studied as the backbone of the hydrogel electrolyte.10–13
From the standpoint of meeting the requirements of worldwide sustainable development, cellulose is considered one of the most promising candidate materials for fabricating hydrogel electrolytes due to its unique structure and distinct properties, such as renewability, biocompatibility, biodegradability, and non-biological toxicity.14–18 However, the inability of the cellulose hydrogel (CH) electrolyte to possess both high ionic conductivity and mechanical strength impedes its application in the field of ZHSCs. Hydrogels can be strengthened to improve their mechanical strength by increasing the interconnections between the polymer chains, forming a dense network structure that improves the transfer of stress and dissipates energy.19,20 Nonetheless, the increasingly tightly cross-linked network structure tends to limit the mobility of ions in the CH electrolyte, resulting in a decrease in ionic conductivity. Therefore, the development of a CH electrolyte with both high ionic conductivity and mechanical strength through a feasible material engineering strategy remains an urgent problem.
The introduction of the two-dimensional nanomaterial bentonite (BT) can improve the ionic conductivity and mechanical properties of the CH via its lamellar structure and coordination interaction with cellulose.21 Nevertheless, the ionic conductivity and mechanical properties of the CH doped with BT nanoplatelets, in which Zn ions act as the conductive medium, still need to be further investigated.
In this study, a natural cellulose/BT hydrogel electrolyte containing a Zn ion inorganic salt solution (CBH-Zn) was successfully prepared for application in ZHSCs. The lamellar structure of BT promotes rapid ion transport in the gaps between adjacent nanoplatelets and the abundant binding sites on its surface are conducive to improving the mechanical properties, which helps break the long-standing trade-off between ionic conductivity and mechanical strength of the CH electrolyte.22–24 In this study, the CBH-Zn was used as the electrolyte to assemble the flexible ZHSC (CBH-ZHSC), in which activated carbon (AC) and Zn foil were used as the cathode and anode, respectively. On the one hand, the ion channels formed between the lamellar structures of the BT nanoplatelets and electronegativity of the cellulose/BT nanocomposites were conducive to rapid Zn ion transport from CBH-Zn to the electrode, thus optimising the electrochemical performance of the CBH-ZHSC. On the other hand, the coordination interaction between BT and cellulose helped to improve the mechanical strength of CBH-Zn, rendering the CBH-ZHSC resistant to various external stimuli. Moreover, the integrated system was prepared by combining solar cells and a CBH-ZHSC, which can be used as a flexible wearable electronic device to power electrical appliances, achieving energy conversion, storage, and utilisation. This study provides a novel approach for the preparation of CH electrolytes with both high ionic conductivity and mechanical strength, exhibiting great potential for applications in flexible EES devices.
Results and discussion
CBH-Zn preparation and characterisation
Cellulose, an abundant, cheap natural renewable resource, is considered an ideal electrolyte polymer matrix for the preparation of ZHSCs. Nevertheless, most CH electrolytes face challenges in maintaining their mechanical strength and high ionic conductivity. Herein, an aqueous NaOH/urea solution was used to dissolve cellulose to produce a stable, homogeneous suspension of cellulose/BT. Uniform distributed BT nanoparticles were prepared on the cellulose chain, which are capable of forming coordination interactions with –OH. A CBH with a three-dimensional network architecture was prepared through covalent bonding between cellulose chains and 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDE). After being dialysed to neutral in deionised (DI) water, the CBH was soaked in a ZnSO4 aqueous solution to reach equilibrium, and an ionic conductive CBH-Zn was obtained. The preparation process is illustrated in Fig. 1a. As illustrated in Fig. 1b, the CBH-Zn possessed shapeable properties that enabled the formation of different fine structures, which are beneficial for its application in various scenarios. Fig. 1c–e shows the three-dimensional porous network architecture of the CBH-Zn using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which facilitates the free movement of the electrolyte ions. In the corresponding energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping, Zn, S, and O were distributed homogeneously, indicating that the ZnSO4 aqueous solution had completely penetrated the CBH-Zn, and the existence of Al and Si indicates the successful doping of the BT nanoplatelets (Fig. 1f–k).

The structure of the freeze-dried CBH-Zn was characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 1l shows the XRD patterns of cellulose, BT, and the CBH-Zn. A characteristic peak of the ZnSO4·7H2O crystal (JCPDS#03-0395) was observed in the XRD pattern of the freeze-dried CBH-Zn, indicating the presence of Zn2+. Moreover, in the CBH-Zn, the characteristic peak of BT shifted from 7.1° to 5.8°, indicating that cellulose was successfully embedded between the BT nanoplatelets and enlarged the interlayer distance between BT (Fig. S1†).25,26Fig. 1m compares the FTIR spectra of the freeze-dried CBH-Zn with those of cellulose and BT, and the peaks at 3337 cm−1 and 2889 cm−1 of cellulose and the CBH-Zn are assigned to the stretching vibration of –OH and asymmetric stretching of C–H, respectively.27 The bending vibration of –OH (1635 cm−1) and stretching vibration of Si–O–Si (980 cm−1) were discovered in the FTIR spectrum of the CBH-Zn, indicating the presence of the characteristic peaks of BT.28 Furthermore, a new characteristic peak of the CBH-Zn at 839 cm−1 was assigned to the formation of Al–O–C, which connected cellulose and the BT nanoplatelets.24,29 Experimental evidence for the interaction of cellulose and BT is provided by the above results. Tetrahedral AlO4 units (denoted as AlTd) and octahedral AlO6 units (denoted as AlOh) have been observed in the solid-state 27Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of BT.30,31 The AlOh ratio of the cellulose/BT nanocomposite is higher than that of BT, indicating that AlTd is partially converted to AlOh during the formation of cellulose/BT nanocomposites.21,32 The above NMR results are consistent with those of XPS. A shift in the Al 2p orbital XPS spectrum peak of CBH-Zn is shown in Fig. 1n as compared with that of BT. The change in binding energy indicates that AlTd is converted to AlOh by coordination with O in cellulose at the BT surface, further confirming that BT and cellulose are involved in the Al–O–C coordination interactions.31 Furthermore, the freeze-dried CBH-Zn was observed to possess C and O from cellulose and Al, Si, and Mg from BT in the XPS spectrum, and the presence of Zn indicates the successful introduction of ZnSO4·7H2O (Fig. S2†).
Mechanical properties and ionic conductivity of the CBH-Zn
The mechanical properties of the CBH-Zn are of significant importance for its application as an electrolyte in flexible EES devices. First, the mechanical properties of the CBH-Zn were investigated. Fig. 2a(i–ii) shows that the CBH-Zn was a hydrogel electrolyte with remarkable mechanical properties that allowed it to carry a 1 kg weight under slight deformation. As shown in Fig. 2a(iii), the CBH-Zn can withstand a variety of deformations such as bending, twisting, and folding without visible cracking. Fig. 2b exhibits that the CBH-Zn possessed a tensile fracture stress of 1.51 MPa with a fracture strain of 82%, better than that of the cellulose–ZnSO4 hydrogel (CH-Zn, 0.37 MPa with a fracture strain of 19%), which could be due to the formation of the Al–O–C bond. Moreover, the CBH possessed a high tensile fracture stress (1.14 MPa) and fracture strain (94%), further confirming that the introduction of the BT nanoplatelets improved the mechanical properties of the CBH compared to those of the CH (Fig. S3a†). In addition, the CBH-Zn exhibited excellent compressive properties (Fig. 2c). In contrast to the CH-Zn, the maximum compressive stress (2.93 MPa) and fracture strain (78%) of the CBH-Zn were 1.8 times and 1.3 times higher than those of the CH-Zn. Compared with the CH, the CBH had a greater compressive stress (2.67 MPa) and fracture strain (80%) (Fig. S3b†). As determined by the calculated compressive modulus and fracture energy, BT nanoplatelets can be added to strengthen and toughen CHs (Fig. S4†). The fatigue resistance of the CBH-Zn was investigated using cyclic compression tests under a strain of 50%. According to the first compressive stress–strain curve in Fig. 2d, there was an obvious hysteresis, indicating that the hydrogen bond fracture is the primary cause of energy dissipation during deformation.21,33 Nearly overlapped strain–stress curves were observed in the subsequent nine cycles, which indicates that the CBH-Zn possessed a satisfactory memory effect.

(h) Comparison of the properties of the CBH-Zn with those of CH electrolytes,34–36 synthetic polymer hydrogel electrolytes,9,37 and zwitterionic polymer hydrogel electrolytes38,39 reported in the literature on the basis of ionic conductivity and mechanical strength. The detailed comparison is summarised in Table S1.† 
The thermal properties of the prepared hydrogels were determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Fig. 2e shows that the freezing points of the CBH and CBH-Zn were located at −14.8 °C and −25.5 °C, respectively. The introduction of a ZnSO4 conductive medium can break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules, which causes hydrogel electrolytes to exhibit excellent anti-freezing properties.40,41 The above conclusion is further supported by the determination of the freezing points of the CH and CH-Zn (Fig. S5†). Moreover, ionic conductivity was determined for the CBH-Zn by soaking the CBH in an aqueous ZnSO4 solution. A concentration of 2.0 M ZnSO4 aqueous solution and soaking time of 48 h were the best experimental conditions for the further study of ionic conductivity at different temperatures (Fig. S6a and S6b†). As shown in Fig. 2f, the CBH-Zn possessed ultrahigh ionic conductivities (28.2 mS cm−1, 38.1 mS cm−1, 46.3 mS cm−1, 61.5 mS cm−1, and 68.0 mS cm−1) over a wide range of temperatures (−20 °C to 60 °C), which were superior to those of the CH-Zn (21.0 mS cm−1, 27.4 mS cm−1, 37.5 mS cm−1, 44.6 mS cm−1, and 54.0 mS cm−1). The BT nanoplatelets with a lamellar structure facilitated ion migration by forming oriented conductive pathways in the CH-Zn, which led to the high ionic conductivity of the CBH-Zn (Fig. S7†).42,43 Furthermore, the thermal stability of BT and the introduction of a ZnSO4 conductive mediator enabled the CBH-Zn to exhibit satisfactory ionic conductivity and mechanical properties even at high and low temperatures (Fig. S8†). The zeta potential of the cellulose, BT, and cellulose/BT nanocomposites were −34.3 mV, −9.3 mV, and −15.5 mV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2g. The electronegativity of the cellulose/BT nanocomposites attracts positive ions to migrate between interstitial spaces of BT separated by cellulose, which can further improve the ionic conductivity. Based on the above experiments, the coordination interaction between cellulose and the BT nanoplatelets is conducive to improving the mechanical strength, and the lamellar structure of BT and the electronegativity of the cellulose/BT nanocomposites are beneficial for improving the ionic conductivity. The CBH-Zn exhibited superior or comparable ionic conductivity and mechanical strength to those of previous studies, as shown in Fig. 2h. A circuit consisting of the CBH-Zn was used to power a light-emitting diode (LED) lamp (Fig. S9†). Owing to the satisfactory ionic conductivity and mechanical properties of the CBH-Zn, there was no significant dimming of the LED lamp when the CBH-Zn was under various deformation states. These results indicate that the introduction of BT can provide CH electrolyte with significant advantages in terms of ionic conductivity and mechanical properties, thus showing a wide range of application prospects.
Electrochemical properties of the solid-state CBH-ZHSC
The electrochemical performance of the prepared CBH-Zn was investigated by assembling a flexible solid-state CBH-ZHSC comprising an activated carbon (AC) cathode and the CBH-Zn and Zn anodes (Fig. 3a). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) were used to determine the electrochemical stability window of the CBH-ZHSC. The CV test was scanned at a rate of 50 mV s−1 under different electrochemical windows between 0.2 V and 1.4–2.0 V (Fig. S10a†). The results show that the CBH-ZHSC had a completely symmetrical CV curve under the electrochemical window of 0.2–1.8 V, and there was no significant current surge until the positive potential rose to 2.0 V. The GCD curve of the CBH-ZHSC at a current density of 1.0 A g−1 exhibited high symmetry when the voltage was below 1.8 V, indicating splendid capacitive characteristics.44 The GCD curve was asymmetric when the voltage increased to 2.0 V (Fig. S10b†). As shown in Fig. 3a, the coulombic efficiency of the CBH-ZHSC approached 100% in the voltage range of 1.4–1.8 V, indicating that the CBH-ZHSC possessed preeminent charge and discharge reversibility. The coulombic efficiency decreased to 88% when the voltage was increased to 2.0 V, indicating that an irreversible side reaction occurred in the CBH-ZHSC, which damaged its safety and cycle life.8,44 In summary, the electrochemical window should be limited to 0.2–1.8 V.

To characterise the electrochemical performance of the CBH-ZHSC from 0.2 V to 1.8 V, the CV and GCD measurements were performed. The CV curves are shown in Fig. 3b for measurements from 3 mV s−1 to 50 mV s−1. The CV curves of the CBH-ZHSC were a combination of rectangular and redox peaks because this device has not only the battery-type reaction on the Zn anode but also the electric double-layer behaviour on the AC cathode.45 The CV curves at different scan rates did not coincide owing to the limitation of ion diffusion. Moreover, the CV curve did not exhibit obvious deformation in spite of the high scan rate of 50 mV s−1, reflecting that the system possesses rapid kinetics and energy storage capacity during the process of electrochemical reactions.46,47 The GCD curves of the CBH-ZHSC at current densities from 0.5 A g−1 to 20.0 A g−1 are presented in Fig. 3c, and the specific capacitance was calculated according to eqn (3),† these values were 301.6 F g−1, 269.1 F g−1, 249.7 F g−1, 214.8 F g−1, 187.9 F g−1, and 164.6 F g−1. Relative to the ZHSC using an aqueous electrolyte, the flexible solid-state CBH-ZHSC exhibited similar CV characteristics, indicating that the electrochemical reaction mechanism was almost unaffected by the hydrogel electrolyte (Fig. S11a and S11b†). The specific capacitances of the aqueous ZHSC at a low current density of 0.5 A g−1 and high current density of 20.0 A g−1 were 252.6 F g−1 and 135.8 F g−1, respectively; this result shows the excellent capacitance of the CBH-ZHSC and hydrogel electrolyte does not significantly affect the electrochemical performance (Fig. S11c†). To demonstrate the impact of BT on the electrochemical performance of the ZHSC, the electrochemical behaviour of the cellulose hydrogel electrolyte-based ZHSC (CH-ZHSC) was investigated using CV and GCD tests at various scan rates and current densities (Fig. S12a and S12b†). As shown in the CV curve, the CBH-ZHSC had a larger enclosed area than the CH-ZHSC, which is an indication of its excellent electrochemical performance (Fig. S12c†). As shown in Fig. 3d, the CBH-ZHSC exhibited a longer charge/discharge time at 1.0 A g−1, which further indicates its excellent electrochemical performance. Fig. 3e compares the rate performance between different samples, and the results indicate that compared with the CBH-ZHSC (301.6 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 164.6 F g−1 at 20.0 A g−1), the specific capacitances of the CH-ZHSC were relatively small, which were 264.0 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 and 126.9 F g−1 at 20.0 A g−1. Furthermore, the incorporation of the BT nanoplatelets improved the electrochemical performance of the ZHSC as determined using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. S13a†). The equivalent series resistance (Rs) and charge transfer resistance (Rct) can be represented by the x-intercept and semicircle diameter, respectively, which were obtained by fitting the equivalent analogue circuit (Fig. S13c†). As listed in Table S2,† the CBH-ZHSC had lower Rs and Rct values than the CH-ZHSC. This result means that the CBH-Zn can provide ions to the electrode under the same electrochemical conditions, owing to the fact that the lamellar structure of BT is beneficial to the formation of oriented ion conductive pathways, and the electronegativity of the cellulose/BT nanocomposites can act as a fast transmission channel for Zn2+.48,49 Therefore, the CBH-ZHSC had a higher specific capacitance than the CH-ZHSC. According to the Nyquist plot of the CBH-ZHSC before and after the cycling measurement, the CBH-ZHSC exhibited lower Rs and Rct after cycling, and the slope of the low-frequency line was larger, which verifies the fast reaction kinetics and preeminent ion transport capabilities of the CBH-ZHSC (Fig. S13b†).50,51 The flexible ZHSC with the BT nanoplatelets exhibited improved electrochemical properties.
The severe self-discharge phenomenon can expose EES devices to huge energy losses during the energy storage process; therefore reducing the self-discharge rate is especially important. The CBH-ZHSC was charged to 1.8 V, and the open-circuit voltage was recorded continuously to evaluate its self-discharge performance. Fig. S14† describes the process in detail. Fig. 3f shows that despite the significant decrease in the CBH-ZHSC open-circuit voltage from 1.8 V to 1.64 V in the first 3 h, the voltage decreased slowly after that, and the high voltage of 1.4 V was maintained after 35 h of self-discharge, indicating the CBH-ZHSC possessed splendid resistance to self-discharge. The CBH-ZHSC could drive the smart timer for 4 h, which revealed a low self-discharge rate (Fig. 3f). The development of hydrogel electrolytes with anti-drying properties is necessary for practical applications. As illustrated in Fig. 3g, the water retention properties of the CH-Zn and CBH-Zn in an open environment were determined at room temperature. The water loss of the CH-Zn was serious, with a residual mass of 86.9% after 5 days, whereas the residual mass of the CBH-Zn reached 95.8% with a mild volume shrinkage. The preeminent water retention of the BT nanoplatelets is responsible for the excellent anti-drying ability of the CBH-Zn. The CV curves and specific capacitances of the CH-ZHSC and CBH-ZHSC after different storage periods were measured to compare their electrochemical properties. As shown in Fig. 3h and i, the CV curve of the CBH-ZHSC still exhibited splendid symmetry, and the capacity retention was 97.3% after 5 days of storage, which was significantly better than that of the CH-ZHSC (88.5%) (Fig. S15a†), verifying the outstanding electrochemical stability of the CBH-ZHSC in an open environment for long-term storage. Fig. S15b and S15c† show the detailed capacity retentions for different numbers of storage days. The Ragone diagram in Fig. 3j further demonstrates the excellent electrochemical properties of the CBH-ZHSC. At a power density of 400 W kg−1, the CBH-ZHSC exhibited a maximum energy density of 97.4 W h kg−1 which was superior to that of the majority of the reported EES devices (Table S3†). The preferable performance should be attributed to the unique properties of the BT nanoplatelets: (i) the two-dimensional nanoplatelet structure enables the formation of oriented ion conductive pathways inside the CBH-Zn, which is conducive to ion migration, and (ii) the electronegativity of the cellulose/BT nanocomposite facilitates the rapid transport of Zn2+. Electrochemical cycling stability is a key indicators used to appraise the properties of solid-state ZHSCs. Benefiting from the satisfactory anti-drying ability of the CBH-Zn, the CBH-ZHSC exhibited excellent cycling stability. As shown in Fig. 3k and Fig. S16,† compared with the CH-ZHSC (capacity retention of 88% after 10000 cycles), the CBH-ZHSC exhibited satisfactory electrochemical cycling stability with 94% capacity retention and 100% coulombic efficiency after 45000 charge/discharge cycles at a current density of 10.0 A g−1. This performance clearly exceeded that of the EES devices reported in other studies, and the cycling stability of the CBH-ZHSC was compared in detail (Table S3†). In addition to the room-temperature operability, the CBH-Zn prepared in this study successfully addresses the shortage of traditional hydrogel electrolytes that cannot work in a wide temperature range through the incorporation of thermally stable BT and an anti-freezing 2.0 M ZnSO4 aqueous solution. Therefore, the CBH-ZHSC can work stably under harsh environmental conditions. Based on the CV and GCD curves of the CBH-ZHSC at −20, 0, 25, 40, and 60 °C, the electrochemical performance declined slightly with decreasing temperature, but still manifested a preeminent specific capacitance of 161.5 F g−1 at −20 °C (Fig. S17a and S17b†). Moreover, compared with the CH-ZHSC, the CBH-ZHSC exhibited better electrochemical performance over a wide temperature range (Fig. S17c and S17d†).
Study of the energy storage mechanism
To reveal the essence of the electrochemical performance, the electrochemical kinetics and energy storage mechanism of the CBH-ZHSC were studied by CV curves using Dunn's method and ex situ XRD spectra. As shown in Fig. 3b, despite scanning at a rapid rate of 50 mV s−1, the CV curve did not exhibit apparent deformation, indicating that the CBH-ZHSC possessed rapid electrochemical reaction kinetics.61 The electrochemical kinetics of the CBH-ZHSC was further investigated by calculating the linear relationship between peak current (i) and scanning rate (v), where i and v should follow the power-law equation:43,62 i = a × vb(1)where a and b are the adjustable parameters. In general, b-values of 0.5 and 1.0 indicate diffusion-controlled and surface-capacitance-controlled energy storage processes, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4a, the calculated b-value of the CBH-ZHSC was 0.873 ± 0.009, which means that its energy storage characteristics are described by both diffusion and capacitive behavior.63 Using the following equations, the percentage of correlation between the capacitive-controlled and diffusion-controlled contributions were calculated:64,65 i = icap + idiff = k1v + k2v1/2(2)or i/v1/2 = k1v1/2 + k2(3)

(d–f) Ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns recorded at different charge/discharge states (d) with a current density of 1.0 A g−1 for the Zn anode (e) and activated carbon (AC) cathode (f). 
According to eqn (3), the values of k1 and k2 are calculated by plotting the relationship curves between i/v1/2 and v1/2, sequentially computing the charge storage contribution. Fig. 4b indicates that the CBH-ZHSC was 32% capacitance-controlled (k1v, orange shaded area) at a scan rate of 3 mV s−1, and the remaining 68% of the contribution was diffusion-controlled (k2v1/2, blue shaded area). Fig. 4c shows the capacitance-controlled contributions of the CBH-ZHSC at different scan rates. The results illustrate that the capacitance-controlled contributions of the CBH-ZHSC increased gradually with increasing scan rate (50 mV s−1, 72%), which confirms its capacitive-dominant qualities and fast kinetic properties at high scan rates.52,66
To explore the energy-storage mechanism of the Zn anode and AC cathode in the CBH-ZHSC, the XRD spectra under different charge and discharge states were further characterised by a series of ex situ measurements. First, the electrode reaction on the Zn anode is discussed. The charge–discharge processes in various states are shown in Fig. 4d. The CBH-ZHSC was charged in the open-circuit voltage state to 1.8 V (thoroughly charged state), then discharged to 0.2 V (entirely discharged state) and finally recharged to 1.8 V; the main component of the Zn anode was still Zn (JCPDS#04-0831). As clearly revealed in Fig. 4e, all the Zn anodes had peaks at 36.2°, 38.7°, 43.0°, 54.2°, 69.9°, and 76.9°, which corresponded well to the (002), (100), (101), (102), (103), and (004) crystal planes for Zn, respectively.67 In the process of ion adsorption and desorption on the Zn anode surface, H+ participates in the reaction, which changes the local pH value on the Zn anode surface, thus leading to the generation of Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O. The intensity variation of each diffraction peak in terms of the charge and discharge processes indicates a change in the crystal orientation during the deposition and stripping conversion processes of the Zn anode. In addition, Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O (JCPDS#39-0688) was detected on the surface of the Zn anode at states II, III, and IV, and its content was relatively low in the first charge/discharge process (states I to III), whereas it increased in the second charge process (states III to IV). During charging and discharging, only a slight change in the intensity of the diffraction peak was observed in the XRD pattern, indicating that the CBH-ZHSC had satisfactory electrochemical stability. The precipitation/dissolution of Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O also participated in the cathodic reaction. As illustrated in Fig. 4f, the CBH-ZHSC was charged from the open-circuit voltage to 1.8 V (state I), and the peak of Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O was absent. Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O flakes were gradually generated during the subsequent discharging process: a few flakes existed in the AC cathode at 1.0 V (state II), and the AC cathode had the largest amount of Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O flakes (state III) after further discharging to 0.2 V. When the AC cathode was recharged from 0.2 V to 1.8 V, the Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O flakes were almost absent (state IV). Eqn (4) shows the formation process of Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O: 4Zn2+ + 6OH− + SO42− + 5H2O = Zn4SO4(OH)6·5H2O(4)
Performance and application of the solid-sate CBH-ZHSC
With outstanding mechanical flexibility and electrochemical stability, the CBH-ZHSC can be an important component in wearable electronic devices. The damage to the CBH-ZHSC was caused by the strain applied to the devices during the bending process. The influence of strain on the bending durability of the CBH-ZHSC was evaluated by changing the bending angle (θ) for a certain bending radius (R) and device length (L) (Fig. 5a). Various bending angles and times were examined to determine the electrochemical stability of the CBH-ZHSC under various conditions (Fig. S18†). The results show that when the bending angle was 180°, the capacity retention of the CBH-ZHSC was still 92.6% after 100 cycles of continuous bending. The decrease in capacity retention is due to the prolongation of the ion transport path inside the CBH-Zn with an increase in the bending angle, which reduces the ion exchange rate (Fig. S19†). Owing to the flexibility of the CBH-Zn and electrode, the assembled CBH-ZHSC exhibited immobile capacity retention and steady charge–discharge curves under various deformations, indicating that the solid-state CBH-ZHSC has satisfactory electrochemical stability (Fig. S20†). Furthermore, the CBH-ZHSC can continuously and stably power a timer, even under heavy pressing, hammering, cutting, sewing, and punching (Fig. S21†).

As one of the abundant renewable resources on Earth, the intermittency of solar energy hinders its real-life application. Therefore, designing a solar energy system with efficient charge and discharge characteristics to meet the demand for timely power supply when needed is one of the main trends of green energy development in the future.68,69 Because of its excellent mechanical strength, rate performance, and cycle life, the CBH-ZHSC can be used as an EES device to store the electrical energy converted from solar energy by the photovoltaic component. As shown in Fig. 5b and c, the solar cell and CBH-ZHSC were connected in series and tied to diverse parts of the human body, and the feasibility of the flexible CBH-ZHSC in practical applications was evaluated by bending at different angles and times. The results show that the capacity retentions of the CBH-ZHSC after 100 cycles of continuous bending at bending angles of 45° and 90° were 97.2% and 95.0%, respectively, indicating that the CBH-ZHSC can be used as a flexible EES device in real life and has excellent electrochemical stability. Herein, a wearable solar charging unit is proposed using the CBH-ZHSC and a solar cell, and this device is used to drive the normal operation of electrical appliances, achieving energy conversion, storage, and utilisation. The solar cells, CBH-ZHSC, and electrical appliances of the integrated system act as energy conversion systems, energy storage devices, and energy utilisation devices, respectively. Fig. 5d illustrates this concept. The integrated system is composed of two parts: the CBH-ZHSC is charged by solar cells in the first part, whereas the CBH-ZHSC in the second part supplies stable electricity for the electrical appliance (Fig. 5d(i)). As shown in Fig. 5d(ii), the system charge/discharge functions by invertible ion adsorption/desorption on the AC cathode and the deposition/stripping of Zn2+ on the Zn anode. Without applying any external current or voltage, the simulated solar light source is used to charge the CBH-ZHSC and measure the time required to charge the CBH-ZHSC to 1.8 V. Fig. 5d(ii) shows that the CBH-ZHSC can be charged to 1.8 V after exposure to one solar light for 22 seconds, indicating that the integrated system had fast charging characteristics. Fig. 5d(iii) illustrates the equivalent circuit of the integrated system during charging and discharging.
To further verify the practicability of the CBH-ZHSC, we assembled a solar charging power system. Multiple CBH-ZHSCs were concatenated in series or parallel to achieve the on-demand energy output requirements (Fig. S22†). As a proof-of-concept demonstration, Fig. 5e shows the fabrication of a solar cell, three CBH-ZHSCs in series, and a light-emitting light strip (or watch) of the integrated system. The system was then tied to different parts of the human body. When outdoor activities are performed under either natural sunlight or a simulated solar light source (i.e., during the daytime), sunlight is absorbed and converted into electricity through the solar cell, which is immediately stored in the CBH-ZHSC. The electrical energy stored in the CBH-ZHSC can be utilised to power the light-emitting light strip (or watch), especially for use at night. The demonstration was shown in Movie S1.† A fully charged CBH-ZHSC can drive the toy fan and electronic watch to operate (Fig. S23†). In conclusion, the integrated system provides proof-of-concept evidence that the prepared CBH-ZHSC with excellent flexibility and electrochemical stability is suitable for the solar-charging system.
Conclusions
In this study, a novel natural cellulose hydrogel electrolyte with both high ionic conductivity (46.3 mS cm−1 at room temperature) and mechanical strength (compressive strength of 2.93 MPa) was prepared by introducing BT nanoplatelets. Because of the lamellar structure of the BT nanoplatelets, an oriented conductive pathway is formed to facilitate ions conduction, and the electronegativity of the cellulose/BT nanocomposites promotes positive ion migration. With the synergy of the above advantages, the flexible solid-state CBH-ZHSC had a maximum energy density and power density of 97.4 W h kg−1 and 16.0 kW kg−1, respectively, as well as an outstanding cycle performance (94% capacity retention after 45000 cycles at a current density of 10.0 A g−1). Furthermore, the CBH-ZHSC was sufficiently flexible to withstand various deformations, and an integrated system with solar cells and electrical appliances is proposed to successfully achieve energy conversion, storage, and utilisation. The CBH-ZHSC possesses promising applications in flexible wearable electronic devices as an EES device with excellent electrochemical performance.
