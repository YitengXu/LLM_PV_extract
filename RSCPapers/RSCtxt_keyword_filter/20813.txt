    , Accepted 5th April 2016First published on 5th April 2016AbstractHerein we report the synthesis and time-resolved spectroscopic characterization of a homoleptic Fe(II) complex exhibiting a record 3MLCT lifetime of 26 ps promoted by benzimidazolylidene-based ligands. Time dependent density functional molecular modeling of the triplet excited state manifold clearly reveals that, at equilibrium geometries, the lowest 3MC state lies higher in energy than the lowest 3MLCT one. This unprecedented energetic reversal in a series of iron complexes, with the stabilization of the charge-transfer state, opens up new perspectives towards iron-made excitonic and photonic devices, hampering the deactivation of the excitation via metal centered channels.
1. Introduction
The exploitation of the photophysical and photochemical properties of transition metal complexes (Pt, Ir, Ru) have been the focus of much attention due to the ability of these compounds to promote energy transfer from their electronic excited states.1 Platinoid metal complexes have been the most used due to their ideal photophysical properties spurring their implementation in OLED2 or DSSC3 devices with high efficiency and stability. However these strategic metals are expensive, scarce and can exhibit some degree of toxicity. As a consequence, the development of light-responsive compounds from cheap and environmentally benign metal-complexes is critical to preserve natural resources and reduce the environmental impact of this potential branch of chemical industry. In this context iron-based complexes can be considered as promising candidates for such a transition.
However, the replacement of ruthenium by iron is extremely challenging. Due to a smaller ligand field splitting, Fe–pyridine complexes are rather known as photoinduced spin-transition materials,4 and are used as such in the research area of molecular magnetism.5,6 The low-to-high spin transition is due to an ultrafast non-radiative deactivation of the 1,3MLCT states into the low-energy metal-centered quintuplet 5T2,7 cutting short on applications of Fe–pyridine requiring higher free energies.
Recently it has been reported that the use of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands in complex C1 (Fig. 1) can prolong the 3MLCT lifetime (9 ps).8 This was rationalized by quantum chemical calculations showing that in these compounds the 3MC and 5T2 states are up-shifted in energy, but still below the 3MLCT. The introduction of σ-donating carbene ligands coordinating Fe is held responsible for these significant changes in the electronic structure. A heteroleptic Fe(II) complex featuring mesoionic triazolylidene bidentate ligands and a 3MLCT lifetime as long as 13 ps while also promoting the red-shift of the absorption band was also reported.9 However the coordination by both bis-carbene ligands resulted in an extremely low oxidation potential for the FeII/FeIII couple (−0.35 V vs. Fc/Fc+) prohibiting the possible ground state regeneration by usual redox mediators (−0.2 V) in a photoelectrochemical application.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of iron complexes, the counter anion is PF6−. 
Our group recently improved the 3MLCT lifetime up to a record value of 16.5 ps from a homoleptic carbene-based complex C2 bearing carboxylic groups (Fig. 1).10 In addition, the photocurrent generation in a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) fabricated from this sensitizer was demonstrated for the first time, albeit with a low power conversion efficiency. Very recently, the Wärnmark group working on the same complex11 published an important additive to this work by demonstrating that injection into the TiO2 semiconductor can occur efficiently from the 3MLCT state.
Thus the improvement of 3MLCT lifetime in iron complexes is a topic of high interest for their further development as photosensitizers applicable in photochemical energy conversion processes, and organic electronics at large.
Starting from the idea that an increase of the delocalization of the MLCT frontier orbitals towards the periphery of the organic ligand should contribute to better stabilization of the 3MLCT state, the new complexes C3 and C4 have been designed (Fig. 1) where iron was coordinated by benzimidazolylidene-based ligands. Herein we report the synthesis and characterization of these new complexes and a new record 3MLCT lifetime of 26 ps.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis
The synthesis of complexes C3 and C4 required the preparation of, respectively, imidazolium salts 3 and 4 that were obtained by controlled methylation of compounds 114 and 2.15 The coordination was accomplished by the reaction of the appropriate imidazolium salt with FeCl2 in DMF in the presence of t-BuOK as a deprotonating agent affording the targeted complexes C3 and C4 (Scheme 1). Complexes C18 and C210 were also prepared for comparison purposes.

For all the complexes, the absorption spectra are composed of three bands comprising individual electronic transitions of different nature. The intense band near 300–350 nm corresponds to π–π* transitions in the ligands. These bands are expectedly particularly intense in cases of C3 and C4 due to the phenyl rings of benzimidazolylidene (BIm) moieties.
At longer wavelengths, the complexes exhibit two distinct band families corresponding to MLCT transitions that are subjected to significant shifts and a change in the shape as a function of the ligands. The bands in the 360–390 nm range are related to the carbene–Fe MLCT transition10 that is strongly affected in energy by switching from imidazolylidene (Im) to benzimidazolylidene (BIm). Indeed the absorption maxima for complexes C3 and C4 are blue-shifted by 20 nm compared with those of C1 and C2.
The same observation can be made for the MLCT bands at lower energy in the 450–600 nm range involving the central pyridine ring that are blue-shifted by 60 nm in BIm containing complexes. This blue shift is clearly in agreement with the electron-accepting effect of the phenyl ring in BIm and in line with cyclic voltammetry measurements (Table 1) showing an increase of the FeII/FeIII oxidation potential going from C1 (0.8 V) and C2 (0.85 V) complexes to C3 (1.04 V) and C4 (1.13 V).
Finally, as already observed for the Im-based complex C2,10 the functionalization of the central pyridine nucleus with the carboxylic groups promotes a notable red-shift of the band at the lowest energy in BIm-based complexes moving from 440 to 500 nm, i.e. from C3 to C4 respectively.
2.3. Photophysics
In order to get further insights into the impact of the BIm ligand on the photophysical properties of the complexes, ultrafast photophysics of C1–C4 were investigated in acetonitrile using transient absorption spectroscopy (TA).
The TA data reveal that the excited state processes happen to follow the same scheme for all iron complexes (data not shown). As an example, Fig. 3 shows a selection of transient differential spectra of C4 in acetonitrile after excitation at 515 nm within the first 600 fs (Fig. 3A) and up to 52 ps (Fig. 3B).
 Fig. 3  Selected transient differential spectra of C4 in MeCN excited at 515 nm. (A) Time delays <600 fs and (B) time range <52 ps. After the initial blue-shift in the first 200–300 fs, the ESA bands do not evolve spectrally, but decay until 100 ps. A 30 nm region around the excitation wavelength is disregarded due to pump scattering. 
The intense negative signals in the 450–520 nm range and at λ < 350 nm are due to ground state bleaching (GSB). In the visible domain, the GSB band coincides perfectly with the ground state absorption maximum (Fig. 2). The positive bands in the 350–450 nm region and above 550 nm reveal two excited state absorptions (ESA). Within the first 200 fs, both ESA bands display a 20–50 nm blue-shift, and their shapes change significantly between spectra until 160 fs. After 600 fs, the differential spectra decay until 100 ps without a noticeable spectral shift.
The long-lived spectral feature with two ESA bands is very similar to the ones reported for the 3MLCT states of C18 and C210 in MeCN. The spectra reported in Fig. 3B are different from the characteristic ESA of the 5T2 quintuplet state observed, for example in Fe(tpy)2, featuring a 10 nm narrow ESA in the near-UV region and zero absorption in the red part of the spectrum.8

Fig. 4A shows kinetic traces at characteristic wavelengths (651 nm black, 556 nm red, 449 nm blue and 371 nm pink) with their fits (solid lines). The spectral blue-shift is characterized by a fast initial decay at 650 nm and a slow rise at 556 nm and 449 nm in the first 0.5 ps.
 Fig. 4  (A) Kinetic traces (open symbol) of C4 with their fits (solid lines) at characteristic wavelengths and (B) decay-associated difference spectra generated by global analysis using one Gaussian and two exponential functions. 3MLCT relaxes to S0 with 27 ps lifetime as shown by the simultaneous recovery of ESA and GSB. At <500 fs, the fast component with 65 fs lifetime is attributed to the relaxation of 1MLCT to 3MLCT and the thermalization of 3MCLT. 
Note that both ESA and GSB traces decay with the same time constant, i.e. the excited state decay directly fills the ground state, as already reported for other imidazole-based iron complexes.8,10
After correction of chirp and solvent contributions, we apply singular value decomposition (SVD) of data in order to filter the spectral and temporal components that are above the noise level. These N components, N = 5 in our case, are retained for global analysis (GA). All N traces are fitted simultaneously by a function with same time constants (see ESI† for details).
Since fast components are very close to the instrument response function (IRF, 60 fs), the first fitting component is chosen as Gaussian and followed by a bi-exponential function. The decay-associated differential spectra (DADS) with their lifetimes are shown in Fig. 4B. DADS3 shows the spectral feature of 3MLCT with two ESA bands, as identified in the raw data. The fit gives a 26 ps lifetime for the 3MLCT state.
In addition, the fitting suggests two sub-100 fs components. The DADS related to the IRF-related Gaussian function is most likely related to spurious, non-corrected solvent response. The 65 fs-DADS is an approximation to the above described spectral blue-shift of ESA observed within the first 200 fs.
The above-discussed spectral and temporal features combined with the lifetime determination by GA allow defining the following excited state reaction scheme for C4:  The reaction starts with a “hot” 1MLCT+ state since the transition is excited with excess energy, above the 0–0 energy of the GS–1MLCT transition. It relaxes on time scales faster than 50 fs (instrument response function, IRF) on the 1MLCT surface and undergoes an ultrafast intersystem crossing into the vibrationally excited manifold in 3MLCT.7d An effective lifetime of 65–100 fs is associated with this thermalization process (see below). The vibrationally relaxed 3MLCT state recombines non-radiatively within 26 ps in C4.
The three other complexes were studied by TA spectroscopy under identical conditions (low excitation density, similar GSB levels). The spectral evolution is very similar to the one shown in Fig. 4, with a double ESA structure, characteristic of the 3MLCT states10 dominating the differential absorption for delay times >500 fs. The SVD traces are well described by the same kinetic fit function as C4, but with variations in the lifetimes.
Kinetic traces clearly showed a notable 3MLCT lifetime improvement switching from Im to BIm-based ligands without and with the acid group, respectively, in Fig. 5A and B. The ESA and GSB kinetic traces have been normalized at 1 ps, after the initial thermalization period, to facilitate a comparison with the slower 3MLCT decay (solid black lines).
 Fig. 5  Kinetic traces of ESA decay (red) and GSB (blue) with their fits (solid black lines), normalized at 1 ps for (A) C1 and C3 and (B) C2 and C4. The BIm-ligand extends the 3MLCT lifetime with and without the –COOH group. 

Table 2 presents the excited state lifetimes obtained by the GA as described above for all the complexes. As shown, C3 has a considerably increased 3MLCT lifetime (16.4 ps) compared with C1 (10 ps) clearly evidencing the positive effect of the BIm ligand, and C4 benefiting from the carboxylic acid groups has the longest 3MLCT lifetime (26 ps) ever reported for a FeNHC complex in solution. As a general trend, the BIm ligand prolonged the 3MLCT lifetimes by more than 60%.

2.4. Computational studies
The new dyes have been analyzed by means of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations. Solvent (acetonitrile) effects have been taken into account using a polarizable continuum method. Firstly, the most relevant singlet excited states responsible for the absorption spectrum have been characterized by means of natural transition orbitals (NTO),12C4's NTOs are presented in Table 3, while the ones of C2 dye can be found in our previous work.10

For the reader's convenience we remind that NTOs can be considered as the optimal orbitals to describe an electronic transition in the TD-DFT formalism. In contrast to the Kohn–Sham molecular orbital basis, with which many occupied-virtual orbital couples are required to describe an electronic transition, the NTO basis generally provides only one (or at maximum two) couple of orbitals to entirely represent all the physics underlying the transition.
As it was the case for the C2 dye10 the low energy portion of the spectrum of C4 is dominated by MLCT transitions. In particular for the lowest transition the density is displaced from the iron atom to both the ligands and particularly in the pyridyl moiety. A significant density accumulation on the carbonyl unit is also observed; hence charge injection into a semiconductor like TiO2 should in principle be possible, since the molecules are grafted onto it through the carbonyl end. Remarkably and because of the symmetry of the complex the charge is almost equally transferred on both ligands.
In order to rationalize the photophysics of the most relevant dyes, we relaxed the geometry of the lowest 3MLCT and 3MC states for C2 and C4 dyes (Table 4). This means that we let the molecule evolve structurally into the respective potential energy minimum.

As shown in Table 4, while the two states are almost degenerate (ΔE = −0.08 eV) in the case of C2, the 3MLCT state is found better stabilized than the 3MC state in C4 (ΔE = 0.12 eV). This is the first example of such energetic reversal for an iron complex.13 Although the energy difference is still quite low, such that both 3MLCT and 3MC states can be thermally populated, this observation may rationalize the longer lifetime of the C4 complex. Indeed the photophysical channel leading to the 3MC population and the subsequent deactivation now appear energetically less favorable. Furthermore, the energetic inversion between the two states is most probably coupled with a higher barrier on the potential energy surface connecting the two states, adding a further kinetic blockage.
In our previous paper,10 we argued that the increased 3MLCT lifetime of C2 as compared to C1 was due to an enhanced charge-transfer character induced by the COOH group. This argument is further supported by the effect of deprotonation that leads to a reduced (14 ps, unpublished result) lifetime due to the negatively charged COO− termination (see ESI† for details). Is a similar effect at work for the lifetime increase observed going from Im to BIm-complexes? To assess this problem we have analyzed the charge-transfer versus the local nature of the excited states. Indeed, the more local a state will be the more favoured will be its recombination within the MC states. Although many factors may affect the excited state lifetime,14 some of them, like the excited state electronic structure, should be seen as more crucial in dictating the photophysics. Locality of the excited states has been calculated, thanks to the ϕS index recently developed by some of us.15 The former index is based on the overlap between ground and excited state electronic densities and is normalized by construction. Values close to 1.0 are characteristic of local transitions while values close to 0.0 indicate extensive charge transfer. Both C2 and C4 show MLCT states with relatively high ϕS values of 0.68 and 0.72, respectively. Such values are indicative of a poor charge-separation and with C4 displaying a slightly more localized excited state than C2 (about 6%), indicating that the electronic coupling argument does not explain the longer 3MLCT lifetime of C4.
3. Conclusion
In summary, a new homoleptic NHC–Fe(II) complex was synthesized, featuring 4 BIm and two pyridine Fe-coordinating ligands. When the pyridines are substituted with COOH groups, a record excited state lifetime of 26 ps is observed for the 3MLCT state. Calculations of the excited state structure of the substituted and the unsubstituted compounds show that in the former the 3MC state lies higher in energy than the 3MLCT, providing a clear explanation for the increased lifetime. The combined experimental and computational study thus opens new prospects for the design of novel NHC–Fe(II) complexes with yet enhanced light-harvesting capabilities: a further increased 3MLCT lifetime and absorption spectra optimized for the red wavelength region may come at hand soon.
4. Methods
4.1. Materials
Solvents and commercially available reagents were used as received. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed by using silica gel 60 F-254 (Merck) plates and visualized under UV light. Chromatographic purification was performed by using silica gel 60 (0.063–0.2 mm/70–230 mesh). Compounds 116 and 217 have been prepared according to reported procedures.
4.2. Instrumentation

1H (400 MHz) and 13C NMR (100 MHz) spectra were recorded on a DRX400 Bruker spectrometer at ambient temperature. The chemical shifts (δ) were calibrated by using either tetramethylsilane (TMS) or signals from the residual protons of the deuterated solvents, and are reported in parts per million (ppm) from low to high field. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data were obtained by using a Bruker micrOTOF-Q spectrometer. UV-vis spectra were recorded in a 1 cm path length quartz cell on a LAMBDA 1050 (Perkin Elmer) spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry was performed on a Radiometer PST006 potentiostat using a conventional three-electrode cell. The saturated calomel electrode (SCE) was separated from the test compartment using a bridge tube. The solutions of studied complexes (0.2 mM) were purged with argon before each measurement. The test solution was acetonitrile containing 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 as a supporting electrolyte. The working electrode was a vitreous carbon rod (1 cm2) wire and the counter-electrode was a 1 cm2 Pt disc. After the measurement, ferrocene was added as the internal reference for calibration. All potentials were quoted versus SCE. Under these conditions the redox potential of the Fc+/Fc couple was found at 0.39 V. In all the experiments the scan rate was 100 mV s−1.

4.4. Photophysics
In our set-up, the 800 nm output of a 5 kHz regenerative Ti:Sapphire amplifier (Amplitude Technologies) is used to generate excitation pulses using a pumping commercial collinear optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS, Light Conversion) followed by frequency doubling to produce ∼60 fs pulses at 515 nm. Broadband white-light probe pulses are obtained by focusing the ∼30 fs 800 nm pulses on a 2 mm thick CaF2 crystal. The 300–700 nm output is measured in two separate sets of data using a Peltier-cooled high-speed charge-coupled device (CCD) mounted at the output of a 25 cm focal length spectrometer (resolution 3 nm). The pump and probe pulses are focused on 80 × 80 μm2 and 40 × 40 μm2, respectively. The pump pulse intensity is carefully reduced so as to work in a regime of linear signal response. The relative linear polarizations of pump and probe are set to a magic angle (54.7°). The concentration of the complexes dissolved in MeCN is adjusted to an absorbance of 0.45 mm−1 at the peak of the S0–S1 transition. The 1 mm path length quartz cell containing the solution is set on a loud-speaker with orthogonal vibration at 10 Hz to avoid degradation which attests that the sample remains intact during the experiment. All transient absorption data presented in this paper are processed following the procedure described in ref. 18 in order to compensate for group velocity dispersion and define time zero within ±20 fs over the entire spectral range. Raman responses from the solvent and cross-phase modulation artefacts are measured in a MeCN only containing flow cell and subtracted after application of an appropriate weighting coefficient.
4.5. Molecular modelling and simulations
All quantum chemical calculations were performed by using the Gaussian09 suite of programs. The ground-state geometry of all the complexes has been optimized at the DFT level by using the B3LYP exchange correlation functional. The double-z LANL2DZ basis set was used for the iron atom, whereas carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen were described by using the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set. Singlet excited states were firstly obtained as vertical transitions from the equilibrium geometry, following the usual Franck–Condon approach, at the TD-DFT level. In this case the system was described using the HCTCH exchange correlation functional and the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set for all the atoms. Note that these conditions have been chosen as the ones that better reproduce the lowest energy part of the absorption spectrum relative to the experimental one. In all the calculations solvent effects were taken into account by using the polarizable continuum model (PCM); more specifically, acetonitrile was considered throughout. The density reorganization in the excited states was analyzed in terms of NTOs by using a locally produced and free downloadable code NancyEX (see http://www.nancyex.sourceforge.net/). Once the singlet states were assessed the same level of theory was used to investigate the triplet manifold, triplet nature (MC or MLCT) was easily identified using the NTO analysis. Subsequently, the first 3MLCT and the first 3MC have been optimized, again using TDDFT at the HCTCH/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory, in order to obtain the adiabatic relaxation energies. Finally ϕS values have been obtained once again using the NancyEX code from post-processing of the attachment and detachment densities. For the convenience of the reader we recall that fs is based on the normalized overlap of the detachment and attachment densities, calculated in the direct space. As such values close to 1.0 are indicative of localized transitions, while charge-transfer states are characterized by values close to zero. The lower the value of ϕs, the higher is the charge-transfer nature of the state.

 	Fig. 3  Selected transient differential spectra of C4 in MeCN excited at 515 nm. (A) Time delays <600 fs and (B) time range <52 ps. After the initial blue-shift in the first 200–300 fs, the ESA bands do not evolve spectrally, but decay until 100 ps. A 30 nm region around the excitation wavelength is disregarded due to pump scattering.	 

 	Fig. 4  (A) Kinetic traces (open symbol) of C4 with their fits (solid lines) at characteristic wavelengths and (B) decay-associated difference spectra generated by global analysis using one Gaussian and two exponential functions. 3MLCT relaxes to S0 with 27 ps lifetime as shown by the simultaneous recovery of ESA and GSB. At <500 fs, the fast component with 65 fs lifetime is attributed to the relaxation of 1MLCT to 3MLCT and the thermalization of 3MCLT.	 

 		 

 	Fig. 5  Kinetic traces of ESA decay (red) and GSB (blue) with their fits (solid black lines), normalized at 1 ps for (A) C1 and C3 and (B) C2 and C4. The BIm-ligand extends the 3MLCT lifetime with and without the –COOH group.
