    , Accepted 24th April 2017First published on 24th April 2017AbstractVolatile organic amine vapors exist in various areas, which can cause a series of harmful effects on environment and human life. Thus, the detection of organic amine vapors with sensitivity and selectivity is greatly needed. This study reports a simple, low-cost, selective and sensitive fluorescence detection of trace organic amine vapors based on CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) nanoplates (NPs) and nanowires (NWs). Upon exposure to organic amines vapors, the fluorescence of MAPbBr3 was strikingly and quickly attenuated (<4 s), and the color of MAPbBr3 changed from yellow to white for some of the organic amines (depending on the R group of R-NHx). This change was rooted in the change of the crystal structure of MAPbBr3 after contacted with different amines. We believe that this result is not only a great advancement in the trace detection of organic amine vapors but is also equally important for fundamental research of organometal halide perovskites.
1. Introduction
Organic amines, a type of malodorous gas, have been widely used in chemical factories, food industries, pharmaceutical plants, domestic waste, etc.1 They are a serious threat to environmental quality and human life.2,3 Therefore, the rapid and sensitive detection of trace amounts of organic amine gas in the air is not only important for ecological monitoring but also greatly needed for people's healthy living. Fluorescence sensor is an efficient and successful method to solve this problem.4–9 However, the synthesis approach of traditional organic fluorescent probes is generally complicated and costly; for example, Eric Mertz et al. reported the synthesis of a cross-linked dendrimer imprinted polymer containing reporter groups for amine guests in up to 12 steps;10 it is difficult to tune the sensory performance for both sensitivity and selectivity,11 and more importantly, the photostability is often a problem that prevents its practical application.
Organometal halide perovskites, such as CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) and CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3), have recently attracted considerable attention due to their excellent performance in photovoltaic devices and light-emitting diodes.12–14 It is reported that the electrical power conversion efficiency of a solar cell made of these materials has exceeded 20%.15 Despite the outstanding electrical and optical properties of organometal halide perovskites, there are no reports on its use in fluorescence sensing, which might be another important application field. The biggest advantage of an organometal halide perovskite is that it can be easily prepared by one-step low-cost solution processing,16 which makes it a better competitor compared with traditional organic fluorescent probes.
In this contribution, we report an organometal halide perovskite nanostructure probe for sensitive, rapid and real-time fluorescence detection of organic amine vapors. The fluorescence of MAPbBr3 is almost totally eliminated upon exposure to organic amine vapour. The corresponding sensing property was investigated systematically.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and methods
Unless otherwise stated, all of the chemicals were purchased from commercial sources and used as received without any further purification. The MAPbBr3 nanoplates (NPs) and nanowires (NWs) were prepared through a modified ligand-assisted solution-phase growth.17–19 The fluorescent sensing performance of the MAPbBr3 sensor film was characterized by a HORIBA FluoroMax-4/Plus spectrophotometer. Crystal morphology and structure changes of MAPbBr3 after exposure to organic amines were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4700) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/max 2550V diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation). To monitor the fluorescence changes of the MAPbBr3 film after reaction with amines, the sensory film was fixed in a sealed cuvette, and the vapors of amines were injected into the cuvette with a glass syringe, and 20 mL of vapor was injected for each sample. The different concentrations of amine vapors were prepared by diluting the saturated amine gas with fresh air.
2.2 Synthesis of MAPbBr3 nanostructure

2.2.1 Synthesis of CH3(CH2)7NH3Br. 
First, 12 mL of n-octylamine (Aladdin) and 30 mL anhydrous ethanol were added to a 250 mL round-bottom flask, stirred and maintained at 0 °C using an ice-water bath. Next, 12 mL of HBr (48% wt in water, Aladdin) was added to the mixture dropwise. The mixture was stirred for 2 h, and the solvents (ethanol and water) were removed by a rotary evaporator at 75 °C. Purification of the products was conducted by dissolving them in ethanol, recrystallizing from diethyl ether, and drying at 50 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.


2.2.2 Preparation of CH3NH3Br. 
CH3NH3Br was synthesized by reacting 20 mL of methylamine (40% wt in water, Macklin) and 25 mL of HBr at 0 °C for 2 h while stirring. Removing solvent by heating at 60 °C for 1 h yielded a white precipitate. The precipitate was washed with diethyl ether by stirring the solution for 30 min: a step that was repeated three times. Finally, recrystallized from a mixed solvent of diethyl ether and ethanol, the white solid was collected and dried at 50 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.


2.2.3 Growth of MAPbBr3 nanostructures. 
A 10 × 20 mm2 quartz plate was washed and ultrasonically cleaned, on which a saturated distilled dimethylformamide (DMF) solution of PbBr2 (Macklin) was spin-coated by a KW-4A spin coater set to 3000 rpm. The as-synthesized CH3NH3Br and CH3(CH2)7NH3Br were dissolved in 7 mL anhydrous isopropyl alcohol (Macklin) with a concentration of 8 mg mL−1 and 9.5 mg mL−1, respectively. This solution was quickly added to a sealed vessel containing 7 pieces of the PbBr2 substrate, with the PbBr2 coated side facing down; the color of the PbBr2 substrate changed from white to yellow immediately, and the entire reaction was allowed to proceed for 24 h. The as-grown MAPbBr3 crystals were gently washed with isopropyl alcohol (Fig. 1) and dried in a glass vacuum dryer.

3. Results and discussion

Fig. 2 demonstrates the absorption and emission spectra of the MAPbBr3 sensory film. It can be observed that MAPbBr3 showed a strong absorption band around 400 nm. Remarkably, its emission spectrum only exhibited a highly symmetric band centered at 534 nm (for more information, see Fig. S1†) with a relatively narrow full width at half maximum of only 20 nm.

Fig. 3a shows a photograph of the MAPbBr3 sensory film excited at 365 nm by a mobile UV lamp after 60 s exposure to air and saturated vapors of different amines. Several representative organic amines were selected such as primary amine [n-propylamine (PA)], secondary amine [diethylamine (DEA)], tertiary amine [triethylamine (TEA)], and aromatic amine [aniline (AN) and benzylamine (BA)]. As shown, the fluorescence of the MAPbBr3 sensory film was completely eliminated after exposure to these saturated organic amine vapors. After exposure to PA, DEA, TEA and BA vapors, the color of MAPbBr3 changed from yellow to white (Fig. 3b2–4 and 6) in a few seconds. However, there was almost no color change after MAPbBr3 exposure to AN vapors (Fig. 3b5). Interestingly, the fluorescence of AN-treated MAPbBr3 could be regenerated after a 30 min vacuum treatment in a vacuum oven at room temperature (Fig. 3c5), and the fluorescence intensity had fallen dramatically compared to that of the untreated MAPbBr3 sample (Fig. 3c1); however, no significant change was observed for the MAPbBr3 samples' exposure to PA, DEA, TEA and BA vapors (Fig. 3c2–4 and 6).

Fluorescence changes of the MAPbBr3 film monitored as a function of the time upon exposure to air and saturated organic amine vapors are shown in Fig. 4. It demonstrates that MAPbBr3 film showed excellent photostability in air, and no photobleaching was detected under that test time, which is far better than a commonly used organic fluorescent probe. More importantly, it exhibited a very fast response to organic amine vapors. A fluorescence attenuation of 92.1% was observed from the MAPbBr3 film in 3.5 s (Fig. 4b) upon blowing the saturated vapors of DEA onto the film surface. It is noteworthy that for the MAPbBr3 film exposed to AN, 17% of the fluorescence enhancement was captured within 247 seconds (Fig. 4a) after the blowing of AN vapors was stopped, which was consistent with the above mentioned fluorescence recovery phenomenon.

To study the sensitivity of the MAPbBr3 film to organic amine vapors, the detection limit for DEA was measured by a stepwise dilution of the saturated DEA vapors (248000 ppm). The attenuation efficiency of the MAPbBr3 film tested at different vapour pressure of DEA at room temperature is illustrated in Fig. 5. A ∼5% fluorescence quenching was still observed when the concentration of DEA vapors was as low as 62 ppb, which is far below its IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health) concentration of 200 ppm.20

The MAPbBr3 film also displayed outstanding selectivity to organic amines. Some of the common solvents, such as those listed in Fig. 6, have little effect on the detection of organic amines. As shown, the vapors of acetone, dichloromethane, ethanol and water at room temperature cause less than 6% fluorescence attenuation in 60 s. In contrast, tetrahydrofuran and toluene could trigger a slight fluorescence enhancement. All of these solvents did not interfere with the detection of organic amines as over 90% fluorescence was attenuated for the organic amines.

Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the MAPbBr3 film exposure to several types of typical amines were observed to explore the morphology change of the MAPbBr3 film before and after the reaction with organic amines. As shown in Fig. 7a, the as-grown MAPbBr3 was composed of nanoplates (NPs) and nanowires (NWs). There was no apparent morphology difference for AN treated MAPbBr3 (Fig. 7b). Transformation of MAPbBr3 from structured NPs/NWs to nanoneedles (Fig. 7c) and microfloc (Fig. 7d) was observed for DEA and BA treated MAPbBr3, respectively, indicating that crystal structure change may occur.

Fig. 8 shows the absorption spectra of MAPbBr3 before and after exposure to DEA, AN, and BA vapors. It can be seen that the location of absorption peaks of MAPbBr3 showed no change after being in contact with AN. However, the peaks of 427 nm and 525 nm were missing for DEA and BA treated MAPbBr3, respectively. In addition, for DEA treated MAPbBr3, there was a red shift at the peak of 300 nm, and for BA treated MAPbBr3, the peak at 400 nm became much sharper. This also indicated that the structures of MAPbBr3 may have changed (this was discussed in detail in Fig. S2 and S3†).

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (shown in Fig. 9) of the MAPbBr3 film before and after exposure to DEA, AN, and BA vapors were obtained to investigate the crystal structure changes during the sensing process. The as-grown MAPbBr3 film showed the standard MAPbBr3 XRD pattern, as described in a previous report,19 where a set of diffraction peaks at 2θ = 15.12°, 21.36°, 30.41°, 33.95°, 37.28°, 43.28°, and 46.05° could be assigned to the (001), (011), (002), (021), (211), (022) and (003) lattice planes of the cubic perovskite phase, respectively. After the treatment with AN vapors, the characteristic peak of MAPbBr3 showed no significant change, demonstrating that the crystal structure did not change. For MAPbBr3 treated with BA or DEA, the characteristic peaks of MAPbBr3 either partially or completely disappeared, and some unknown peaks (marked with black dot) arose, suggesting the structure change of MAPbBr3. What confused us is that these unknown peaks in BA-treated and DEA-treated MAPbBr3 could not be matched to either PbBr2 or some other possible compounds such as C6H5CH2NH3PbBr3 and (C2H5)2NH2PbBr3, respectively; hence, further investigation is needed to confirm the crystal structure of MAPbBr3 exposure to BA and DEA.

The possible sensing mechanism was proposed as follows. The results mentioned above demonstrated that the fluorescence changes of the MAPbBr3 were rooted in the interaction of MAPbBr3 and organic amine vapors. According to a previous report,21 the alkyl amine can be embedded into the PbI2 layered structure via the interaction of a PbI6 octahedral and N atom of alky amine. Most likely, MAPbBr3 perovskite reacted in the same manner with organic amines. Considering the color and structure changes of MAPbBr3 upon exposure to PA, DEA, TEA and BA vapors, the reaction of R-NHx + CH3NH3Br → R-NHx+1Br + CH3NH2 might occur, as the size of group R is larger than CH3, leading to the collapse of the MAPbBr3 perovskite framework. While the color and structure of MAPbBr3 didn't change after exposure to AN vapors, which likely in that the AN molecule can't be totally inserted into the MAPbBr3 perovskite framework due to the rigid plane structure of benzene ring group closely adjacent to the amino, the following process might occur: CH3NH3PbBr3 + xC6H5NH2 → CH3NH3PbBr3·xC6H5NH2; the formation of CH3NH3PbBr3·xC6H5NH2 results in fluorescence disappearance. When this sample was evacuated, C6H5NH2 molecule was partially released from the coordination complex, resulting in the partial fluorescence recovery. On the other hand, these amines have very different pKb. PA, DEA, TEA and BA have a pKb around 3, but AN due to its chemical structure has a pKb of 9.4.22 Thus, treatment of the MAPbBr3 crystals with AN does not affect its crystal structure, as shown in Fig. 9, as the alkalinity of AN is too weak to interact with them.
To gain more insight into the fluorescence change of AN-treated MAPbBr3, we examined the fluorescence lifetime of the MAPbBr3 and the evacuated AN-treated MAPbBr3 (Fig. 10). The fluorescence decays were acquired using excitation and emission wavelengths of 405 nm and 534 nm, respectively. A cut-off filter of 450 nm was placed before the emission monochromator to prevent the light scattering photons emitted by the solid samples from reaching the detector. The fluorescence decays were analyzed with a sum of exponentials, whose expression is provided in eqn (1): (1)
 Fig. 10  Lifetime decay of MAPbBr3 and AN-treated MAPbBr3 + vacuum treatment (excitation wavelength: 405 nm, emission wavelength: 534 nm). 
The results from the fits (Fig. S4 and S5†) are shown in Table 1. Based on the analysis of the fluorescence decays, the short decay time obtained in Table 1 for the MAPbBr3 sample (shorter than the time-per-channel used in the decay acquisition) was most likely due to residual light scattering and was omitted in the calculation of the number-average lifetime of the decays 〈τ〉. 〈τ〉 was found to be 8.8 and 7.8 ns for the MAPbBr3 and MAPbBr3 + AN samples, respectively. The smaller 〈τ〉 value obtained for the MAPbBr3 + AN sample suggests some residual dynamic quenching, but its minor contribution to the quenching (less than 10%) does not account for the massive quenching by AN observed in Fig. 4a. Because this quenching is hardly dynamic in nature, it must be the result of static interactions between AN and the MAPbBr3 crystals.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we showed a highly photostable, selective, sensitive, simple and low-cost fluorescence probe to detect organic amine vapors based on the MAPbBr3 NP/NW materials. The fluorescence attenuation rate of MAPbBr3 exceeded 90% in the presence of organic amine vapors, and this change only took several seconds (<4 s). The color of MAPbBr3 changed from yellow to white upon exposure to PA, DEA, TEA and BA vapors, whereas there was almost no color change for MAPbBr3 in AN vapors. The fluorescence of MAPbBr3 exposed in AN could be partially regenerated after vacuum treatment at room temperature. SEM and XRD characterization suggested that the color change resulted from the crystal structure change, which was attributed to the chemical reaction between MAPbBr3 and organic amines. Understanding this property will not only help researchers to use organometal halide perovskite in existing fields in a better way but will also inspire a broader range of applications in other fields.
