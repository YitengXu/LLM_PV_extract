    , Accepted 31st January 2022First published on 2nd February 2022AbstractThis work investigated CuGaS2 (CGS)/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) as fluorescent materials for a luminescent downshifting (LDS) layer and a luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) with a single-crystalline silicon (sc-Si) solar module. The bandgap of the CGS/ZnS QDs was adjusted to ∼3.1 eV by changing the molar ratio of Cu/Ga, and in so doing a transparent and colorless LDS layer that converted near-ultraviolet (UV) light to visible light was fabricated. The resulting QDs, which exhibited a high photoluminescence quantum yield of 73%, were embedded in ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer resin to fabricate a QDs@EVA film. The short-circuit current (ISC) of the sc-Si solar module under simulated solar light decreased from 39.35 mA to 38.30 mA (−2.7%) by using the QDs@EVA film instead of an EVA film without QDs. Correspondingly, the photoelectronic conversion efficiency (η) changed from 18.07% to 17.56% (−2.8%). The decreased photocurrent was because of light scattering by aggregated QDs, and overcame the wavelength-conversion effect of the LDS film. In contrast, the QDs@EVA film was effective for LSC because the ISC and η relatively increased by +77.7% and +96.2%, respectively. The visible light emitted by the UV-excited QDs and the visible light scattered by the QDs contributed to the photoelectric conversion.
1. Introduction
Sunlight is an abundant and freely available energy source, and thus attractive as a renewable energy source. Despite intensive development in photovoltaics (PVs) over the past decades, efficient conversion of solar energy into electricity by PV devices remains challenging. The theoretical maximum energy conversion efficiency, known as the Shockley–Queisser limit, depends on the bandgap (Eg) of the optical absorption layer, and researchers estimated it to be only ∼30% for a single-crystalline silicon (sc-Si) solar cell (Eg = 1.12 eV).1 One of the major energy losses is the mismatch between the solar spectrum and the spectral response of solar devices.2 Thermalization of photon energies exceeding the Eg, and nonabsorption of photons with energies less than the Eg, account for ∼50% of the incident light loss in sc-Si solar cells.2 Moreover, the actual conversion efficiency in practical applications is even lower because the protective agent absorbs near-ultraviolet (UV) light.3
A luminescent downshifting (LDS) layer with phosphors is an active area of research toward improving the conversion efficiency of solar cells. Phosphors for the LDS layer include organic dyes,4–8 rare-earth complexes,2,9–11 and inorganic nanoparticles.12–19 Organic dyes and rare-earth complexes are not suitable for use in solar devices; a durability of more than 20 years is required for solar modules. Therefore, inorganic fluorescent nanoparticles such as quantum dots (QDs) are promising. Baek et al. fabricated LDS layers using core/shell CdSe/ZnS QDs and Cd0.5Zn0.5S/ZnS QDs, and introduced them into sc-Si solar cells.13–15 CdS/ZnS QDs and Cd0.5Zn0.5S/ZnS QDs exhibited relative increases in power conversion efficiency: 5.51% and 6.4%, respectively.13,14 Further improvement of the conversion efficiency necessitates reducing the self-absorption loss of the QDs. Mn2+-Doped QDs avoid self-quenching and self-absorption because of their large Stokes shift, rendering them suitable LDS materials. ZnxCd1−xS/ZnS:Mn2+ QDs, Cd0.5Zn0.5S/ZnS:Mn2+ QDs, and CsPbCl3:Mn2+ QDs exhibit an improved power conversion efficiency of ∼3%.16–18 Moreover, an improvement of 7.4% was reported for an LDS layer by using ZnSe/ZnS:Mn2+/ZnS QDs.20
Researchers have obtained a large Stokes shift by defect-related emission. CuInS2 (CIS) QDs (which have been extensively studied in various fields such as solar devices, lighting, photocatalysts, and bioimaging21) exhibit defect emission that pertains to the acceptor levels of vacancies in the Cu+ sites (VCu).22 In our previous report, LDS layers using CIS/ZnS QDs with an Eg of 2.92 eV and a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 59.9% were prepared.23 Based on the change in the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of a commercial sc-Si solar module, the photocurrent in the near-UV region was increased by including the LDS layer.23 Accordingly, further improvement of the LDS effect requires a higher PLQY and adjustment of the Eg to 3.1 eV, which corresponds to 400 nm at the absorption edge of the UV-vis spectrum to minimize the absorption loss for visible light.
CuGaS2 (CGS)/ZnS QDs are promising LDS materials. This nanophosphor has a larger Stokes shift and small self-absorption loss compared with CIS/ZnS QDs.24 The bulk Eg of CGS is 2.4 eV,25,26 which is larger than the 1.53 eV of CIS;27 therefore, CGS/ZnS QDs can adjust the Eg to 3.1 eV more readily than can CIS/ZnS QDs. Furthermore, development of low-toxic fluorescent QDs without Cd and Pb is becoming increasingly important.28,29 CGS has a low environmental load because it does not make use of Cd and Pb (which are restricted by RoHS 2 product-level compliance) and the toxic element Se. One can fabricate QDs by hot injection.30 The PL of CGS QDs is undetectable because of nonradiative relaxation caused by surface defects, whereas ZnS shell passivation drastically improves the luminescent properties.30 Introducing the ZnS shell generates defects such as ZnCu (Zn2+ substituted at Cu+ sites) and GaCu (Ga3+ substituted at Cu+ sites) near the core surface. The radiative recombination that pertains to surface defects and Cu vacancies (i.e., VCu) in the Cu+ sites could cover the entire range of visible emissions, achieving 75% of the PLQY.30,31 Because of the formation of an alloy of the core and shell, the Eg changes in accordance with the elemental composition of the CGS core and the quantum size effect.32–34 A decreased Cu content in the CGS core improves PLQY,34 probably because of enhanced defective emission that pertains to the Cu defect level. Jalalah et al. improved the power conversion efficiency by 4.2%, by directly dispersing CGS/ZnS QDs with 76% PLQY on a bare-Si solar cell.31 However, commercial solar modules are structured with an absorption layer covered with an encapsulation material, such as ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer resin. EVA is transparent in the near-UV and visible regions, and is widely used as an encapsulant for solar cells, greenhouse covers, and laminated glass.35–37
In this work, a transparent and fluorescent composite film was prepared by embedding CGS/ZnS QDs in EVA resin, to investigate its effect as a LDS layer on the performance of a commercial sc-Si solar module. The PLQY and Eg of the CGS/ZnS QDs were optimized in accordance with a nominal Cu/Ga molar ratio by hot injection. Moreover, a luminescent solar concentrator (LSC), which is another PV application of luminescent materials,38 was also demonstrated.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Zinc(II) acetate dihydrate (99.9%) and copper(I) iodide (99.5%) were purchased from FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical. Gallium(III) iodide (99.99%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Oleic acid (>85.0%), 1-dodecanethiol (DDT) (>95.0%), and 1-octadecene (ODE) (>90.0%) were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry. Toluene (>99.5%) and ethanol (>99.5%) were purchased from Kanto Chemical. Oleylamine (80% to 90%) was purchased from Acros Organics. Sulfur powder (>99.999%) was purchased from Mitsuwa Pure Chemical. Granular EVA polymer (Evaflex EV150) was purchased from DuPont-Mitsui Polychemicals. Toluene and ethanol were dehydrated over molecular sieves (3A 1/8, FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical) prior to use.
2.2. QD preparation
A mixture of zinc(II) acetate dihydrate (4.00 mmol), oleic acid (4.0 mL), DDT (2.0 mL), and ODE (2.0 mL) was heated at 190 °C for 20 min. The mixture was then bubbled with Ar for 30 min to yield a ZnS shell stock solution I. A mixture of zinc(II) acetate dihydrate (8.00 mmol), oleic acid (8.0 mL), DDT (4.0 mL), and ODE (8.0 mL) was heated at 190 °C for 20 min. The mixture was then bubbled with Ar for 30 min to yield a ZnS shell stock solution II. A mixture of sulfur powder (4.0 mmol) and ODE (4.0 mL) was heated at 190 °C to yield a sulfur stock solution.
Oleylamine (5.0 mL) and DDT (0.5 mL) were poured in a four-necked flask and bubbled with Ar for 30 min. Copper(I) iodide (0.125, 0.0625, 0.05, or 0.0417 mmol) and gallium(III) iodide (0.500 mmol) were then added to the four-necked flask. Herein, the nominal molar ratio of Cu+ to Ga3+ (Cu/Ga) was adjusted to 1/4, 1/8, 1/10, or 1/12. The ZnS shell stock solution was placed in a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel connected to the four-necked flask. The system was degassed at 120 °C for 30 min and purged with Ar. The temperature was then increased to 180 °C. Then 2.0 mL of the sulfur stock solution was injected swiftly into the four-necked flask, and the mixture was maintained at 190 °C for 4 min to grow CGS core QDs. The ZnS shell stock solution I was then added to the dispersion of CGS core QDs at a rate of 1.0 mL min−1. The temperature was the increased to 220 °C and the mixture was aged for 30 min. The ZnS shell stock solution II in a syringe was then again injected into the dispersion of QDs at a rate of 1.0 mL min−1 and continuously heated at 250 °C for 60 min to grow CGS/ZnS core/shell QDs. After cooling to room temperature, toluene (7.5 mL) and ethanol (25.0 mL) were added. The resulting dispersion was centrifuged at ∼16000g (12000 rpm using a rotor of 10 cm in radius) for 10 min. The resulting precipitate was redispersed into toluene (5.0 mL) under ultrasonication. After adding ethanol (15.0 mL), the precipitate was collected by centrifugation for 10 min. This cycle of washing and centrifugation was performed 2×. The resulting precipitate was redispersed in toluene to prepare a QD dispersion. The precipitate was also dried in a vacuum desiccator overnight to obtain a solid sample.
2.3. Fabrication of QDs@EVA films
A mixture of granular EVA (0.52 g), toluene (6.0 mL), and ODE (300 μL) was stirred for 5 h to prepare the EVA solution. The centrifuged QD precipitate (50 mg) prepared as described in the previous section was then added to the EVA solution and dispersed under ultrasonication. After Ar bubbling for 30 min, the resulting QD dispersion was stirred for 30 s and defoamed for 30 s by using a planetary centrifugal mixer (Thinky, AR-100). The resulting dispersion was dropped on a Petri dish and dried overnight under ambient conditions to fabricate a QDs@EVA film with a 0.1 mm film thickness and a QD concentration of ∼7.0 wt%. A blank EVA film (i.e., without QDs) was also prepared in the same manner for comparison. The dried film was cut into a square piece (25 mm × 25 mm) and directly attached as an LDS layer to a commercial sc-Si PV module (25 mm × 25 mm; KIS). Another square piece (35 mm × 35 mm) of the dried film was also prepared to demonstrate LSC applications.
2.4. Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles were obtained with an X-ray diffractometer (RINT-2200, Rigaku, Tokyo) equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source and a monochromator. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectra were measured by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (M4 TORNADO, Bruker). QD morphologies were observed with a transmission electron microscope (TEM; FEI, Tecnai G2 and Tecnai Osiris). Mean particle sizes were estimated by 50 individual particles in each TEM image. UV-vis absorption spectra of the QD dispersions were measured with a UV-vis optical absorption spectrometer (V-750, JASCO). Herein, for analyses at the same QD concentration, the net absorbance of the dispersions at 350 nm was adjusted to 0.05. The Tauc plot was calculated in accordance with eqn (1) to determine the Eg of the QDs39 (1)where α is the absorbance, h is the Planck constant, ν is the frequency, and A is a constant. The value of n was 0.5 because CGS is a direct transition-type semiconductor.30 Transmission spectra of the film samples were measured with a UV-vis optical absorption spectrometer (V-750, JASCO) equipped with a standard film holder (FLH-741, JASCO) or an integrating sphere (JASCO, ISV-922). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra and absolute PLQYs were measured with a quantum efficiency measurement system (QE-2000-311C, Otsuka Electronics). Film thicknesses were evaluated with a scanning electron microscope (SEM; JSM-7600F, JEOL). Current–voltage (I–V) curves were measured with a source measure unit (ADCMT, 6242) under AM1.5G simulated solar light (1000 W m−2) generated with a solar simulator (XES-40S1, San-Ei Electric). IPCE measurements were performed with source measure unit (B2901A, Keysight Technologies), under irradiation by a monochromatic light source (MLS-1510, Asahi Spectra). The results of the I–V curves and IPCE analyses were the averages of five and three measurements, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of CGS/ZnS QDs in accordance with Cu/Ga molar ratio
Structural and morphological characterizations were evaluated for the CGS/ZnS QDs. XRD peaks of CGS/ZnS QDs prepared at Cu/Ga = 1/12 to 1/4 were assigned to chalcopyrite-type CGS and zinc blende-type ZnS (Fig. S1, ESI†). The peaks could not be clearly distinguished because the peak positions of CGS and ZnS were close to each other. Table 1 shows the elemental compositions measured by XRF. The actual Cu/Ga molar ratio decreased with decreasing nominal ratio. The decrease in Cu/Ga indicates an increasing extent of Cu defects in the CGS crystal. The quantity of Zn detected was 20× higher than that of Ga in all of the samples, indicating that the ZnS shell similarly grew on the CGS cores. Mean particle sizes (Table 1) were estimated from TEM images (Fig. 1). The mean particle sizes were 2.3–2.4 nm regardless of the Cu/Ga ratio. Lattice fringes were observed on some particles in high-resolution TEM images (Fig. S2, ESI†). The fast Fourier-transform images of QDs with Cu/Ga = 1/10 indicate spots, derived from the observed lattice fringes. The estimated lattice fringe spacing was 3.01 Å, which may be attributable to the (112) plane of CGS and the (111) plane of ZnS.

 Fig. 1  TEM images of CGS/ZnS QDs at Cu/Ga = 1/4, 1/8, 1/10, and 1/12. A corresponding fast Fourier-transform image is also shown for Cu/Ga = 1/10. 

Fig. 2 shows photographs, UV-vis absorption spectra, and PL spectra of toluene dispersions of the CGS/ZnS QDs. Herein, the net absorbance at 350 nm was adjusted to 0.05 by diluting the QD concentration. All dispersions were colorless and transparent under white light. As indicated by the UV-vis absorption spectra, all of the samples absorbed near-UV light at wavelengths less than ∼400 nm. Their absorption edges blue-shifted with decreasing Cu/Ga ratio. Correspondingly, the Eg determined from the Tauc plots (Fig. S3, ESI†) monotonically increased from 2.95 eV to 3.11 eV (Table 1). This may be because of the lowered maximum valence band level that is attributable to the weakened repulsion between the Cu 3d and S 3p orbitals.40,41
 Fig. 2  Photographs of CGS/ZnS QDs dispersions in toluene under white light and 365 nm UV light, and their corresponding UV-vis absorption and PL spectra. 
All of the dispersions exhibited warm white emission under 365 nm UV excitation. CGS/ZnS QDs have donor levels that are attributable to defects of GaCu (Ga3+ substituted in the Cu+ site) and ZnCu (Zn2+ substituted in the Cu+ site), and acceptor levels of VCu (i.e., Cu+ vacancy);31 therefore, one can assign PL peaks to radiative recombination between the conduction band or the donor and acceptor levels of VCu (Fig. S4, ESI†). The various defect levels correspond to the broad PL peak, whereas small self-absorption was facilitated by the sufficiently large Stokes shift of the defect-related PL mechanism. The PL peak positions (Table 1) blue-shifted from 581 nm to 566 nm with decreasing Cu/Ga ratio. This may be attributable to changes in the energy levels of the defects and Eg.33 The PLQY monotonically increased from 51% to 73% as the Cu/Ga ratio decreased from 1/4 to 1/10, whereas a decrease to 60% was observed at Cu/Ga = 1/12. The formation of Cu defects could improve the PLQY because of an increased probability of radiative recombination;34 however, excess defects caused PL quenching probably because of enhanced nonradiative processes. The PL properties of CGS QDs have not yet been well reported as compared with those of the similar material CIS QDs. According to a previous report,42 a decrease in Cu/In ratio of CIS/ZnS QDs intensified thermal quenching, indicating that excessively increased Cu defect levels contribute to non-radiative recombination process as well as luminescence. The authors expect that Cu defects in CGS/ZnS QDs may also exhibit the similar influence on their PL properties.
The CGS/ZnS QDs did not absorb visible light and exhibited the highest PLQY at a nominal Cu/Ga ratio of 1/10. The QDs efficiently converted UV light to visible light; therefore, their composite film with EVA resin was fabricated and evaluated as an LDS layer for a commercial sc-Si solar module.
3.2. Characterization of QDs@EVA film
A QDs@EVA film was fabricated by embedding the CGS/ZnS QDs prepared at a nominal Cu/Ga = 1/10 in EVA resin at 7.0 wt%. Its thickness was about 0.1 mm (Fig. S5 shows a corresponding cross-sectional SEM image, ESI†). Fig. 3 shows photographs of the QDs@EVA film and blank EVA film. Both films were colorless and transparent under white light. The EVA film did not exhibit luminescence under 365 nm UV light, whereas the QDs@EVA film exhibited the warm white emission of the CGS/ZnS QDs. Fig. 4 shows corresponding transmission and PL spectra. Inline and total transmission spectra were measured with a standard film holder (Fig. 4A) and an integrating sphere (Fig. 4B), respectively. The transmittance of the QDs@EVA film in the inline transmission spectra was much lower than that of the EVA film in the entire region. This may be attributable to scattering loss of the incident light. TEM observations indicated that aggregated QDs of ∼100 nm and individual primary particles were dispersed in the EVA (Fig. S6, ESI†). Total transmittance was measured with the integrating sphere to avoid this light-scattering loss. A decrease at wavelengths less than ∼400 nm was observed for the QDs@EVA film because of the optical absorption of the embedded QDs. The apparent transmittance in the UV region was higher than the actual value because the integrating sphere collects the emission of the film excited by the incident light. The higher transmittance of the QDs@EVA may be attributable to the light confinement effect (because of the light scattering), which prevented escape of the reflected light from the integrating sphere. The PL spectrum of the QDs@EVA film indicated the emission peak of the CGS/ZnS QDs (Fig. 4C). Its PLQY was 70%; therefore, PL degradation by the film formation process was not significant.

3.3. Effect of QDs@EVA film on an sc-Si solar module
To evaluate the effect of the QDs@EVA film on the performance of a solar device as an LDS layer, a QDs@EVA film and a blank EVA film were attached to a commercial sc-Si solar module (Fig. S7, ESI†). Fig. 5A shows their I–V curves measured under AM1.5G simulated solar light. Table 2 summarizes the short-circuit current (ISC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and photoelectric conversion efficiency (η) calculated from the I–V curves. The ISC decreased from 39.35 mA to 38.30 mA by using the QDs@EVA film instead of the blank EVA film. Correspondingly, η decreased from 18.07% to 17.56%. Herein, the changes in ISC and η were −2.7% and −2.8%, respectively. No change in VOC and FF were observed, indicating that the decrease in η was attributable to the change in ISC. To explain this photocurrent decrease, IPCE spectra were measured (Fig. 5B). The solar module with a blank EVA film was difficult to exploit with near-UV light for photoelectric conversion. The QDs@EVA film increased the IPCE in the UV region, indicating that the wavelength conversion of near-UV light to visible light by the QDs contributed to an increase in the photocurrent. In contrast, the IPCE in the visible region was slightly decreased because of the enhanced light scattering loss by the aggregated QDs in the EVA resin. This photocurrent loss by the visible light scattering overcame the wavelength-conversion effect.

Such a composite film is applicable to LSC. A light-guiding plate and a commercial sc-Si solar module (35 mm × 10 mm; KIS) were assembled (Fig. 6). The performance of the LSC was measured by irradiating simulated solar light to the squared area (35 mm × 35 mm) without masking tape. The fabricated film (35 mm × 35 mm) was attached to this window. Based on the I–V curve measurements (Fig. 7A and Table 3), the photocurrent was enhanced by the QDs@EVA film, although the LSC without a film and with a blank EVA film exhibited a photocurrent, probably because some of the incident light reached the solar module (because of reflection in the glass plate). The ISC increased from 1.024 mA to 1.820 mA by using the QDs@EVA film. Correspondingly, η increased from 0.130% to 0.255%. Their relative changes were +77.7% and +96.2%, respectively. An increase in the IPCE was observed over the entire wavelength region (Fig. 7B), indicating that light scattering at the attached QDs@EVA film contributed to the photoelectric conversion of the sc-Si solar module as well as to the PL of the QDs. The decreased IPCE at >500 nm was attributable to the optical absorption of the soda glass (Fig. S8, ESI†); therefore, one could further enhance the photocurrent and photoelectric conversion efficiency by using other transparent plates without optical absorption in the visible region.

4. Conclusions
In this work, CGS/ZnS QDs were investigated as wavelength-conversion materials for an LDS layer in solar devices. The nominal Cu/Ga ratio changed the Eg, emission wavelength, and PLQY of the QDs. As a result, optimal CGS/ZnS QDs with Eg ∼ 3.1 eV and a maximum PLQY of 73% were prepared via hot injection at Cu/Ga = 1/10. Furthermore, transparent and luminescent EVA composite films with embedded QDs were fabricated. The QDs@EVA film absorbed only UV light because of excitation of the QDs and exhibited efficient warm white emission under UV light. The QDs@EVA film and blank EVA film were attached to the top of a commercial sc-Si solar module to evaluate the I–V curves under AM1.5G simulated solar light. The relative changes in ISC and η by using the QDs@EVA film instead of the EVA blank film were −2.7% and −2.8%, respectively. The decreased photocurrent for visible light because of light scattering by aggregated QDs overcame the wavelength-conversion effect of the LDS film for UV light. One could minimize the light scattering loss that is attributable to aggregation of the QDs by improving the affinity between the QDs and resin. However, the PL of the QDs and the scattered visible light contributed to photoelectric conversion in the LSC system. The relative changes in ISC and η by using the QDs@EVA film were +77.7% and +96.2%, respectively. This research will facilitate development of colorless transparent windows for PV applications.
