The doping of GQDs into poly[N-9′′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)]:C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PCDTBT:PC71BM) active layer resulted in 21% enhancement in power conversion efficiency. The doped GQDs act as exciton dissociation centres in the PCDTBT:PC71BM system. The improvement can be mainly attributed to the fact that the GQDs provide plenty of exciton dissociation interfaces and improve the charge transport pathway. Moreover, the doping of GQDs also offered a general route to optimize the light absorption of organic photovoltaic devices. Our results indicate that doping of hydrothermally synthesized GQDs offers a facile approach to improve the performance of the polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) with polymer donor and fullerene acceptor blends have attracted much attention due to their advantages including ease of fabrication, low cost, flexible devices, light-weight and large area fabrication.1–5 The blend of semiconducting polymer and fullerene derivatives increase exciton diffusion lengths due to the large donor–acceptor interfacial area.6,7 Moreover, PSCs with narrow bandgap semiconducting polymers have achieved power conversion efficiency (PCE) higher than 8%.8–12 However, poor carrier mobility of the organic active layer restricts further improvement of device performance.13,14
Quantum dots (QDs) have been recently exploited to enhance the PSCs performance due to their tunable bandgap and large optical absorptivity.15–17 It has been demonstrated that the light absorption range of QDs can be tuned by using different materials or changing the nanocrystal size.18,19 However, they are typically difficult to synthesize and not environment friendly. Recently, graphene quantum dots (GQDs) has gained much attention due to its applications.20–24 Much effort has been expended to exploit the optoelectronic properties of hybrid nano-composite materials with GQDs to improve the efficiency of photovoltaic devices owning to its tunable bandgap.25–27 Moreover, GQDs exhibit a good dispersity in many solvents which makes it solution-processable in a number of mediums.28–30 Green-luminescent graphene quantum dots which has a uniform size of 3–5 nm was synthesized as electron-acceptors for photovoltaics; the LUMO level of GQDs is in the range of 4.2–4.4 eV in P3HT/GQD-based devices, lower than the most-commonly reported graphene work function of 4.5 eV; as a result, an enhanced open-circuit voltage (Voc) was obtained which improved the PCE.31 Oxidized graphene quantum dots (GOQDs) and GQDs with various reduction times added to the active layer, play a positive role in contributing to an increased device performance.32 The controllable size, large optical absorptivity, tunable bandgap and many other properties of GQDs make it an excellent photovoltaic material.
In this study, organic photovoltaic devices with active layers of PCDTBT:PC71BM:GQDs were fabricated. Hydrothermally synthesized GQDs incorporated devices showed better performance than the pristine ones. Although the developments have reported in PSC society, several issues need to be addressed in excitons dissociation and carriers transport in OSCs with the active layer of PCDTBT:PC71BM:GQDs. Excitons were created by light absorption. If they were created at the distance less than the diffusion length (∼10 nm) from donor and acceptor interface, the excitons were dissociation and transferred to their respective phase and dissociated at the donor and acceptor interfaces. However, a low excitons dissociation efficiency is an obstacle for high device performance. We introduced GQDs into PCDTBT:PC71BM system, to further improve exciton dissociation. The GQDs acted as exciton dissociation centres in the PCDTBT:PC71BM system. Therefore, more dissociated excitons and higher photogenerated current is obtained. To investigating the propertied of PCDTBT:PC71BM:GQDs thin films and the process of exciton dissociation, photoluminescence (PL) and absorption spectra were studied to verify the findings.
Experimental
Preparation of GQDs
Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized by a modified Hummers method.33 The GQDs were synthesized by a hydrothermal approach as reported elsewhere.34 Briefly, GO (0.05 g) was firstly added into concentrated H2SO4 (10 mL) and HNO3 (3.3 mL) for 4 h under mild ultrasonication. The mixture was transferred to a poly(tetrafluoroethylene)-lined autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 10 h. After cooling naturally to room temperature, the mixture was diluted with deionized (DI) water (130 mL). Na2CO3 was continuously added into the solution until the solution turned dark brown. The solution was dialyzed in a dialysis bag (3500 Da) for 36 hours and the GQDs obtained.
Device fabrication and characterization
The indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates were cleaned with acetone, isopropanol, and deionized water in sequence, followed by O2 plasma treatment for 60 s. MoO3 acts as a hole transport layer (HTL) which was deposited onto the ITO substrate through thermal evaporation with a thickness of 5 nm. PCDTBT and PC71BM with a mass ratio of 1:4 (7 mg mL−1:28 mg mL−1) were dissolved in dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). GQDs were dispersed in 1 mL PCDTBT:PC71BM blends to the desired quantity. The concentration of GQDs is 0.02 wt%, 0.04 wt%, 0.06 wt%, 0.08 wt%, 0.10 wt% with respect to PCDTBT:PC71BM blend, respectively. The solution mixture was subsequently spin-cast onto the MoO3 layer (1000 rpm, 30 s). The active layer was then annealed at 70 °C for 30 min in a nitrogen atmosphere. A LiF layer (∼1 nm) and Al electrode (100 nm) were deposited sequentially by thermal evaporation. The structure of PSC devices containing different concentrations of GQDs in the active layer was ITO/MoO3/PCDTBT:PC71BM:GQDs/LiF/Al. In order to avoid oxygen and humidity perturbation, all devices were fabricated and tested in an N-filled glovebox with water and oxygen below 0.1 ppm. The evaporator is directly connected with the glovebox. Devices can be transferred between the evaporator and the glovebox. Firstly, ITO substrates were transferred to evaporator in an N-filled glovebox. MoO3 was deposited on the top of ITO. Subsequently, the substrates were transferred from evaporator to glovebox. The active layer was spin-coated, followed by thermal annealing in glovebox. Then, the devices were transferred from the glovebox to the evaporator for deposition of LiF and Al.
For the device characterization, electrical measurements were performed on a Keithley 2400 Source Meter at room temperature, under the spectral output from a Newport 9225 1A-1000 solar simulator using an AM 1.5 G filter with a light power of 100 mW cm−2 in glovebox. The cells were measured with a shadow mask and only ITO-coated glass was exposed to light. Incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed under short circuit conditions with respect to a calibrated silicon diode (Crowntech QTest Station 1000AD) in glovebox. The morphologies of active layers were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode (Veeco). The absorption spectra was measured by an ultraviolet/visible spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-1700). PL spectra, absorption spectra and KPFM was measured in air. All AFM images were measured in air and were obtained on the same solar cell but without the LiF and Al layers.
Results and discussion
Device schematic of the PSCs is shown in Fig. 1a. MoO3 exhibits excellent hole collection property at the photoactive layer interface which was deposited on the ITO substrate by thermal evaporation.35,36 Fig. 1b shows the materials in this study. We doped the as-prepared GQDs into PCDTBT:PC71BM active layer and found that there is a positive effect on the PSCs performance, where the Jsc and FF were improved by optimizing the doping concentration. The photovoltaics device with 0.08 wt% doping concentration exhibits an enhanced PCE of 7.02%.

The GQDs solution of o-DCB (0.1 mg mL−1) was dropped onto the carbon support films to take the transmission electron microscope (TEM) image and spin-coated onto the silicon to take the AFM image. Fig. 2a shows the TEM image of GQDs.

The diameters of GQDs were mainly distributed in the range of 27–38 nm (32.5 nm average diameter) (Fig. 2b). AFM images show that their topographic height were between 0.5 nm and 2 nm with average height of 1.5 nm (Fig. 2c and d), indicating that the GQDs were single layered or bi-layered.37 As we can see in the TEM image, the GQDs were well separated and aggregation was not seen in the image. This conclusion was well supported by the AFM image. The TEM and the AFM images indicated that the GQDs were well dispersity in dichlorobenzene.
To further investigate the GQDs optical properties, photoluminescence (PL) and UV-vis absorption spectra of GQDs were studied (Fig. 3). In the UV-vis absorption spectrum, a strong absorption peak at ca. 225 nm can be observed, which was assigned to the π–π* transition of aromatic sp2 domains.38,39 The GQDs also exhibited an excitation-dependent PL behavior as most carbon nanoparticles do.40–42 The PL peak shifted from 481 nm to 537 nm with the excitation wavelength changing from 360 nm to 500 nm.

Fig. 4 shows X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) C 1s spectra and FTIR spectra of GQDs. In the XPS C 1s spectra of GQDs (Fig. 4a), the signal at 284.8 eV, 286.6 eV, 288.5 eV and 289.2 eV are assigned to sp2 carbon, C–O, O–CO and CO, respectively.43,44 The GQDs were further analyzed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). In the FTIR spectra (Fig. 4b), the GQDs showed C–O (alkoxy) stretching peak at 1139 cm−1 and C–O (carboxyl) deformation peak at 1400 cm−1. Furthermore, the FTIR spectra of the GQDs shows a CO stretching vibrational band at 1718 cm−1.45,46 The as-prepared GQDs possess plenty of functional groups, such as –OH, epoxy and CO. Therefore, the GQDs showed an excellent solubility in water and most polar organic solvents.47

The influence of GQDs on the morphological properties of active layer was examined by AFM. Fig. 5 shows the 3 μm × 3 μm AFM images of the PCDTBT:PC71BM film with 0–0.10 wt% GQDs doping. For the pristine PCDTBT:PC71BM (Fig. 5a), it shows a smooth and featureless topography with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.58 nm. For the active layers with various GQD doping concentrations, the RMS roughness is 0.59, 0.61, 0.63, 0.66 and 0.67 nm, respectively. Apparently, the GQDs doped active layers exhibited higher roughness than that of undoped films. According to the morphological images, we found that the film construction was almost unchanged. On the one hand, the thickness of active layer is about 100 nm, much higher than the height of GQDs, and the GQDs were well-distribution in active layer. On the other hand, the doping concentration of GQDs was relatively low even the concentration reached 0.10 wt%. Therefore, the GQDs doping have little impact to the bulk film properties.

To further investigate the influence of GQD doping concentrations on the performance of PSCs, the current density–voltage characteristics and IPCE were measured (Fig. 6). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PCDTBT:PC71BM solar cells containing different concentrations of GQDs are presented in Fig. 6a, with the performance details summarized in Table 1, and all the values are average of 50 devices. The optimized control device without GQDs shows a PCE of 5.55%, Voc of 0.85 V, Jsc of 10.81 mA cm−2, FF of 60.0%. The Jsc and FF increase gradually with the concentration of blending GQDs from 0.02 wt% to 0.08 wt%. However, the Jsc and FF begin to decrease when the doping concentration increases to 0.10 wt%, and resulting a PCE of 6.43%. The optimum concentration of 0.08 wt% GQDs provides the best performance, Jsc of 12.79 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.85 V and FF of 63.6%, leading to a PCE of 7.04%. With the increasing of GQDs weight ratio, the GQDs provide a large number of carrier transport interfaces. Therefore, Jsc and FF were enhanced due to the improvement of charge carrier transport which leading to the increase in PCE. However, with the weight ratio of GQDs reaching 0.10%, the PCE was dropped significantly. The main reason for this drop of the PCE at high concentrations of GQDs was a decrease in the FF and Jsc. The decrease in the FF can be explained by increased leakage current. It seems that once the concentration of GQDs exceeds a certain value, the agglomerated sheets provide a parasitic path for the current. This leakage current can decrease the FF and PCE. The FF and PCE consequently decreased as a result of the increased leakage current because the agglomerated GQDs behaved as potential recombination sites.

Fig. 6b shows the IPCE corresponding to the J–V characteristics of Fig. 6a. For the doping solar cells, IPCE exhibits significant increase in the optical absorption range from 400 to 650 nm compared to the control device. The enhancement in the IPCE is direct evidence of the increased Jsc. The measured Jsc were well matched with the Jsc calculated from integration of IPCE curves (Fig. 6b). The IPCE for PCDTBT:PC71BM device showed a maximum of 61% and for GQDs doped device the maximum is 67%. The enhancement of IPCE in the range of 400–560 nm must be due to the present of GQDs in the active layer, corresponding to the increasing of absorption in the same range (Fig. 8). The enhancement indicated that more incident light was absorbed due to the incorporation of GQDs and promoted the generation of excitons. This also indicated that the transport enhancement with GQDs effectively prevented carrier recombination, thereby, effectively enhanced the device efficiency. Therefore, the GQDs showed a significant effect on the photon absorption and photocurrent which observed in IPCE spectra.
We also evaluated series resistances (Rs) and shunt resistances (Rsh) (Table 1). It is noteworthy that the device doped with 0.08 wt% GQDs showed clearly increased Rsh and decreased Rs. This indicated that the leakage current can be slashed by GQDs. The incorporation of GQDs resulted in a significant improvement of the device performance. This remarkable device performance was realized by the synergistic enhancement of the exciton dissociation and the transport of separated electrons.
The PL is measured to examine the charge transfer among the active materials. Fig. 7a shows the PL spectra of GQDs doped PCDTBT films. The PL quenching is shown in Fig. 7a for PCDTBT with 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.10 wt% GQDs compared to that without GQDs. Pristine PCDTBT film exhibited an emission around 680 nm.48 With the GQDs composition, the PL emission peak gradually decreased. The decrease confirmed that there was an efficient charge transfer from PCDTBT to GQDs via a quenching mechanism as observed in P3HT/CNT films.49 The exciton dissociation is shown to be enhanced and electron/hole recombination reduced by incorporating the GQDs, which can also make a contribution to the performance improvement of PSCs as observed previously. Fig. 7b displays the time-resolved PL spectra of pristine and GQDs doped PCDTBT films. Obviously, the lifetimes of PCDTBT films significantly decrease with the GQDs addition. This suggests that carriers generated by the illumination are efficiently transferred from PCDTBT to GQDs, which corroborates that GQDs play an active and supportive role in the charge transfer process.

We also performed UV-vis absorption analysis of PCDTBT doped with different concentrations of GQDs. The absorption spectra of PCDTBT blended films with various concentrations of GQDs are shown in Fig. 8. The PCDTBT films exhibit two absorption peaks at 390 and 577 nm, and an absorption onset at 657 nm (1.89 eV).50 It is clear that GQDs doping enhance the intensity and broaden the wavelength range. We attribute the enhancement to scattering and reflecting effects of GQDs. The optical path length of incident light was increased by scattering and reflecting, therefore an enhanced absorption was observed. Combined with the quenching observed in the PL data, this adds evidence that the photons absorbed are converted to charge carriers, which result in improvement in the Jsc and therefore the PCE.

The GQDs effectively afford exciton separation interfaces and carrier transporting pathways, which led to the increase of Jsc. In general, the exciton lifetime and mobility in organic semiconductors are limited by radiative and non-radiative decay, so only exciton generated close to the donor and acceptor interface will give rise to charges. For devices without doping, the relatively low Jsc is due to the lack of interfaces for dissociation of photogenerated excitons. However, with the GQDs incorporation, the GQDs provides a large surfaces area for the formation of donor and acceptor interfaces which benefit to the exciton separation and provide carriers transport pathway (confirmed by PL spectra in Fig. 7). The doped devices showed an absorption improvement in the range of 400–600 nm. The GQDs showed scattering and reflecting effects in active layers which increase the light path length. But the increase in absorption was slight and therefore cannot significantly affect the Jsc. As a consequence, the increasing Jsc is mainly attributed to the improved exciton dissociation and carriers transport.
To explore the doping effect of GQDs on PCDTBT further, the work function of GQDs was measured by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), with the energy diagram shown in Fig. 9. For an efficient electron transport at the organic semiconductor and GQDs interfaces, the work function of GQDs should match the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the neighboring semiconducting materials. As shown in the figure above, the work function of GQDs was 4.7 eV, which was match with LUMO of PC71BM (4.3 eV). Therefore, GQDs can readily accept electrons from PC71BM and transfer to a neighboring PC71BM molecule. The work function of GQDs can clearly explain the transfer of photoexcited electrons.

Conclusions
In conclusion, addition of GQDs into PCDTBT:PC71BM active layer is proved to enhance the OPV devices performance. The incorporation of GQDs results in improved Jsc compared to the undoped devices. The enhanced Jscs for GQDs doped devices are attributed to that the GQDs provide exciton interfaces and improve charge transfer, and the uniform distribution of GQDs in active layers make contribution to better FFs, therefore obtaining optimal PCEs for GQDs doping devices. The 0.08 wt% doped GQD concentration results in the best device performance, and accomplishes a PCE improvement from 5.53% (control devices without GQDs) to 7.02% which correspond to 21% enhancement. The doping of GQDs also offers a general route to optimize the light absorption of organic photovoltaic devices owing to scattering and reflecting effects of GQDs. The compatibility of the carbon based GQDs allows for many more optimum variants of the system to be combined with the PSCs to further improve the devices.
