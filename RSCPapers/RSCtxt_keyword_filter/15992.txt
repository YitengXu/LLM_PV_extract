    , Accepted 10th September 2015First published on 10th September 2015AbstractThermal stability is an important issue of polymer solar cells (PSCs), especially for the large scale PSCs in potential real application. A new strategy of introducing porphyrin compounds to prevent fullerene aggregation and stabilize device performance under thermal stress has previously been proposed by this group. However, the effect of the porphyrin chemical structure on thermal stability still remains unclear, and the decreased power conversion efficiency (PCE) resulting from porphyrin addition needs to be overcome. In the present work, different types of porphyrins, including β-substituted and/or metallized ones, were selected, and their interactions with fullerene were first theoretically simulated, and then the morphology stability of porphyrin/fullerene binary blend films was quantitatively studied. In addition, the effect of porphyrin properties, such as self-aggregation and photo-thermal stability, was also investigated. It was eventually found that porphyrin BL3, which is –NO2-substituted and Cu-metallized, was the most promising candidate for improving the thermal stability while simultaneously keeping the device PCE higher than that of the ones without porphyrins. This porphyrin selection strategy, which has also demonstrated the feasibility for the P3HT:PC71BM system, is wished to be the stepping-stone in the study on the thermal stability of photovoltaic devices and push forward the PSC real application.
1. Introduction
The concept of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blends of electron-donor and electron-acceptor organic semiconductors to fabricate polymer solar cells (PSCs) has been widely adopted in the last two decades.1–3 Based on this concept, significant achievement has been realized: single and tandem BHJ structures have demonstrated efficiencies of up to ∼10.0% and 11.0%,4–9 respectively. PSCs are a promising photovoltaic technology that utilize green solar energy with several advantages, such as lightweight, flexibility, roll-to-roll large area, and low cost. A sufficient donor/acceptor interface for charge carrier generation, continuous percolating pathways for efficient electron and hole transport and collection, and nano-sized fullerene crystallites to prevent electron–hole recombination are targeted for an optimized BHJ active layer.2,10 However, this optimized morphology is generally unstable because nano-sized fullerene tends to grow with time, especially under the accumulated heat coming from long-term sunlight irradiation, resulting in power conversion efficiency (PCE) decay.11 Therefore, it is urged to solve this stability issue via an effective and simple method both for scientific research and real application.
Significant efforts have been exerted to improve the morphological stability, such as decreasing the regioregularity of donor materials to weaken the crystallization-driven phase separation,12,13 increasing the glass transition temperature of donor materials to inhibit fullerene diffusion,14,15 mixing different fullerenes to interfere with fullerene nucleation,16,17 constructing donor polymer nanowhiskers to restrict fullerene diffusion,18,19 replacing traditional acceptors by amorphous fullerenes,20–22 using compatibilizers to weaken phase separation,23,24 and locking the morphology by covalent bonding.25 These methods have achieved promising effects on the stability of donor/acceptor blend films.
Porphyrins and their analogues have already been successfully implemented in certain device types, notably in dye-sensitized solar cells, but they have remained largely unexplored in BHJ organic solar cells.26 Porphyrin could attract C60 and form a complex because of the π–π interaction or van der Waals force,27,28 and this supramolecular interaction could be established universally and easily between porphyrin and fullerene without the need of specific conditions. In our previous study, we have demonstrated that porphyrins could also interact with PC61BM, which is a derivative of C60 and mostly used as an acceptor in organic solar cells, and the thermal stability of the devices has been significantly improved.29 However, the porphyrin used in the previous study has a negative effect on the device efficiency, which limits porphyrin utilization. Furthermore, porphyrin is a class of a large family of compounds and the effect of the porphyrin structure on the thermal stability still remains unclear.
In the present work, different types of porphyrins were selected and the interest was focused on the relationship between the porphyrin chemical structure and the device performance. The interaction between porphyrin and fullerene was first theoretically simulated and quantitatively calculated, and then the stability of P3HT:PC61BM:porphyrin blend films was investigated experimentally in terms of the micrographic morphology, crystallization kinetics of PC61BM, and thermodynamics. The effect of other porphyrin properties, such as self-aggregation and photo-thermal stability, on the morphology was also discussed in detail. Finally, the efficiency and thermal stability of the devices based on P3HT:PC61BM:porphyrin blend films were evaluated.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) used in this study was synthesized via Grim polymerization, and the number-average molecular weight (Mn) was estimated by GPC to be around 55000 g mol−1 with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.43 and a regioregularity of 98.2%. All the porphyrins were kindly supplied by Guoyong's group, Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, CAS. [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) (99.9%) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) (99.5%) were purchased from American Dye Source, Inc., and o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB, anhydrous, 99%) was acquired from Sigma-Aldrich Co.
2.2 Sample preparation and characterization
The weight ratio of P3HT to PC61BM was fixed at 1:1, the concentration of P3HT was maintained at 20 mg mL−1 in ODCB, and the porphyrin solution (2 mg mL−1 in ODCB) was separately added into P3HT:PC61BM blend solution. To eliminate the interference of the molecular weight, the mole amount of porphyrin (3.78% or 7.86%) was adopted relative to the PC61BM component in blend solution. The solution was stirred at 60 °C for 12 h, then spin-coated at a speed rate of 700 rpm for 2.5 min or drop-cast on clean and dried glass for subsequent characterization.
UV-visible absorption spectra were collected on a Lambda 750 spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA), and the film was fixed by using pre-designed locating equipment to ensure that the incident light penetrated the same position during the in situ measurement. Optical microscopy investigation was carried out on a Carl Zeiss A1m microscope equipped with an infinity 4-11 digital camera from Lumenera Corporation, Canada. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was carried out on a TA Q100 instrument under an atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The sample powders were prepared by drop-casting the solution on a glass slide at room temperature, dried in the atmosphere for 12 h, and then collected by scratching.
2.3 Thermal- and photo-degradation
Thermal degradation was conducted in a N2 glovebox. The freshly prepared film was heated at 60 or 130 °C on a hot-stage for different periods of time.
Before photo-degradation measurement, the freshly prepared film was first thermally annealed at 130 °C for 15 min. Photo-degradation was first conducted in a N2 glovebox for 55 h under 3000 W m−2 illumination irradiated from a metal halide lamp. The film was then transferred into an atmosphere with 25 °C of room temperature and 30% of humidity and illuminated under a 250 W high-pressure mercury lamp (central wavelength of 365 nm) with a UV cut-off filter (>400 nm) for 1.5 h.
2.4 OPV device fabrication and characterization
The glass-indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate with ≤10 Ω sq−1 (Zhuhai Kaivo Optoelectronic Technology Co., Ltd) was first cut into 3.0 cm × 3.0 cm and patterned by laser ablation, then ultrasonically rinsed with detergent, de-ionized water, acetone and isopropanol sequentially for 25 min per each and subsequently exposed to a UV-ozone for 25 min. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene):poly-(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios P VP.AI 4083) solution was passed through a 0.45 μm filter before being deposited on ITO with a thickness around 30 nm by spin coating at 3000 rpm and dried at 150 °C for 20 min in air. The active-layer solution was spin-coated at a speed rate of 700 rpm for 2.5 min or 300 rpm for 4.5 min on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer under a nitrogen atmosphere. After that, the film was thermally annealed on a hot-stage. The device was subsequently completed by thermal evaporation of LiF (0.8 nm) and Al (100 nm) under <1 × 10−5 Torr pressure, and the active area of the device was defined to be 9 mm2. The current–voltage (J–V) measurement of the polymer photovoltaic cell was conducted immediately in a glovebox by using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measurement Unit (SMU) with a Peccell solar simulator under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2.
3. Results and discussion
The porphyrins with various chemical structures selected in this work could be divided into two groups: group I – non-metallized porphyrin, including 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphine (BL0), β-(4-chloro-1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4-octafluorobutyl)-5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphine (BL1), and β-nitro-5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphine (BL2); group II – metallized porphyrin, mainly β-nitro-5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphine copper(II)-5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H (BL3), 23H-porphine copper(II) (BL4), 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H,23H-porphine zinc(II) (BL5), 5,10,15,20-tetraphenyl-21H, and 23H-porphine nickel(II) (BL6). Their chemical structures are listed in Table 1.

3.1 Binding energy and planarity
To investigate whether porphyrins can attract PC61BM to form supramolecular interaction, computational simulation was conducted, and C60 was selected as the model compound instead of PC61BM. The geometries of porphyrins, C60, and porphyrin/C60 supramolecular complexes were optimized at the B97-D/6-31G* level of theory; the simulated structures of porphyrin/C60 are presented in Fig. 1 and Table S1.† For BL0-BL5 porphyrins, the geometrical center of the non-metallized or the metallized-porphyrins is situated approximately above the electron-rich 6:6 double bond of C60 (Fig. 1a), which is consistent with previous reports.30,31 For the BL6(Ni)/C60 complex, however, the metal center Ni is located on the carbon atom junction (Fig. 1b).
 Fig. 1  B97-D/6-31G* optimized geometries of (a) BL0(H)–BL5(Zn)/C60 and (b) BL6(Ni)/C60 complexes. 
Based on the B97-D/6-31G* optimized geometry, the binding (association) energy (Eb) of the porphyrin/C60 complex was calculated at the PBE0-D3/cc-pVTZ level of theory (Table 2). The Eb difference of BL0(H)/C60, BL1(C4F8Cl)/C60, and BL2(NO2)/C60 is smaller than 0.3 kcal mol−1, which is also found for BL3(Cu & NO2)/C60 and BL4(Cu)/C60, suggesting that the substitution has a negligible influence on the stabilization of the supramolecular complex. For the metallized porphyrin/C60 complexes, however, Eb increases from −17.7, −21.1 to −22.0 kcal mol−1 passing from Ni, Cu to Zn, respectively, indicating that the metal ion plays an important role and the electron-richer metal atom gives more stabilized metal/C60 interaction.32

The effect of metallization and substitution on planarity is also investigated. As shown in Fig. 2a, a model of the porphyrin plane simplified from the optimized geometry consists of four N atoms and twelve C atoms. Fig. 2b shows the variation in the dihedral angle with the position, and the detailed values are given in Table S2.† It is clearly seen that the plane of BL5(Zn) almost does not fluctuate, whereas that of BL6(Ni) fluctuates drastically. The sharp plane distortion of BL1(C4F8Cl), BL2(NO2), and BL3(Cu & NO2) occurs only in the pyrrole ring containing the substitution group.

To further evaluate the degree of distortion comprehensively and quantitatively, the angle between the plane that consists of four N atoms and the plane of the substituted pyrrole ring was also simulated by using Diamond software for the same optimized geometry. The detailed results are shown in Fig. S1.† The results from the above two methods consistently indicate that, in comparison to BL0(H), β-substitution decreases the planarity of BL1(C4F8Cl) and BL2(NO2), while the effect of metallization on planarity depends on the metal ion.
The increase in the macrocycle distortion of non-metallized porphyrin is accompanied by the bathochromic shift of the absorption band due to the destabilization of the π-system.33 The UV-visible spectra of non-metallized porphyrins (Fig. S2†) show that the planarity gets better following the order of BL0(H) > BL2(NO2) > BL1(C4F8Cl), which agrees with the calculated result, while for the metalized porphyrins, the planarity order of BL5(Zn) > BL4(Cu) > BL6(Ni) is reported to be related to the ionic radius (Zn2+(0.74 Å) > Cu2+(0.72 Å) > Ni2+(0.69 Å)).34
3.2 Morphological stability of the photoactive layer
Although the computational results indicate that all the porphyrins can attract fullerene, it is necessary to know which porphyrin is better for stabilizing the morphology in practice. The morphological stability of the blend film was first assessed by optical microscopy (OM). Based on the previous study,29 3.78% of the molar ratio of porphyrin to PC61BM in the P3HT:PC61BM (1:1, wt) blend film was selected for better observation. All blend films were thermally annealed at 130 °C for 3 h.
OM images are presented in Fig. 3, which show that the morphologies of all the blend films are stabilized by the incorporation of porphyrins, but to different degrees. For convenient and quantitative comparison, the number and length of aggregates, which are ascribed to PC61BM characterized by TEM and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analyses (Fig. S3†), were statistically calculated and are illustrated in Fig. S4.† From this figure it can be seen that the values are: (>1000 and 4.16 μm), (114 and 4.10 μm), (365 and 5.36 μm), (282 and 6.32 μm), (69 and 5.42 μm), (120 and 4.89 μm), (38 and 11.00 μm), and (728 and 5.09 μm) for the reference and P3HT:PC61BM:(BL0–BL6) blend films, respectively. For a clear comparison, the product of the number and length representing the PC61BM crystallites is used to describe the morphological stability of the P3HT:PC61BM:porphyrin blend film (higher value, lower morphological stability). Thus, the capability of non-metallized and metallized porphyrins to stabilize the morphology is BL0(H) > BL2(NO2) > BL1(C4F8Cl) and BL3(Cu & NO2) > BL5(Zn) > BL4(Cu) > BL6(Ni), respectively, which is also supported by the total area of PC61BM aggregates obtained from the processed OM images shown in Fig. S5.†
 Fig. 3  OM images of P3HT:PC61BM blend films with and without (ref. 29) 3.78% of porphyrins after 3 h of annealing at 130 °C. 
The dynamics of PC61BM crystallization during the annealing process was studied by UV-visible spectroscopy (Fig. S6†). The decreasing rate of the peak intensity at 335 nm, which represents the PC61BM absorption, was calculated by normalized IPCBM/I0 (where IPCBM and I0 are the intensities of PC61BM absorption and incidence light at λ = 335 nm, respectively),29 and the obtained values were plotted against time, as shown in Fig. 4. In the variation curve, the period where the dramatic change of the IPCBM/I0 value appeared is the “growth” period, which dominates the PC61BM crystallization process. By linear fitting with an R > 0.98, the slopes of the curves in this region are (×10−4): 2.26, 4.75, 3.38, 1.69, 2.06, 1.37, and 7.27 for P3HT:PC61BM blend films loaded with BL0–BL6. As the slope increases, the PC61BM crystallization becomes easier to proceed. Therefore, the morphological stability of the blend film is BL0(H) > BL2(NO2) > BL1(C4F8Cl) and BL3(Cu & NO2) > BL5(Zn) > BL4(Cu) > BL6(Ni) for non-metallized and metallized porphyrins, respectively.
 Fig. 4  Variation in PC61BM absorption (λ = 335 nm) with annealing time. The slopes of linear fitting for P3HT:PC61BM bend films with 3.78% of different porphyrins are: 2.26 × 10−4 (BL0), 4.75 × 10−4 (BL1), 3.38 × 10−4 (BL2), 1.69 × 10−4 (BL3), 2.06 × 10−4 (BL4), 1.37 × 10−4 (BL5), and 7.27 × 10−4 (BL6). 
To evaluate the PC61BM crystallization behavior, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was also performed. Fig. 5 shows the DSC curves arranged according to the crystallization temperature of PC61BM. The exothermic peak around 157.9 °C and the endothermic one around 252.7 °C are the crystallization and melting peaks of PC61BM, respectively, and the endothermic peak around 220.0 °C is assigned to P3HT melting.29 Once the porphyrins are incorporated, the PC61BM crystallization peak shifts from 173.2 °C to 188.6 °C and from 164.0 °C to 188.8 °C for samples loaded with non-metallized and metallized-porphyrins, respectively, which could be ascribed to the higher thermal energy needed for PC61BM to overcome the barrier to crystallize due to the interaction between porphyrin and PC61BM. Meanwhile, the PC61BM melting peak shifts toward a lower temperature because of the formation of PC61BM crystals interspersed with porphyrin. Based on the DSC analysis, the morphological stability of P3HT:PC61BM:porphyrin blend films follows the order: BL0(H) > BL2(NO2) > BL1(C4F8Cl) and BL3(Cu & NO2) > BL5(Zn) > BL4(Cu) > BL6(Ni) for non-metallized and metallized porphyrins, respectively.
 Fig. 5  DSC curves of P3HT:PC61BM bend films with 3.78% of (a) non-metallized porphyrins and (b) metallized porphyrins. 
So far, the planarity, binding energy, and morphological stability of the porphyrin/PC61BM complex have been theoretically calculated and experimentally evaluated. All data are summarized in Table 3 for comparison. For non-metallized porphyrins, the substitution decreases the degree of planarity, which is unfavorable for stabilizing the morphology. While for metallized porphyrins, the situation seems complicated because planarity alone could not explain the order of morphological stability (heavily distorted but stable BL3(Cu & NO2) versus less distorted but unstable BL5(Zn) and BL4(Cu)). In this case, the porphyrin aggregation and solution stability should be considered, as discussed below.

3.3 Effect of porphyrin self-aggregation on morphological stability
The self-aggregation of porphyrin, driven by the tendency to form stacking-type aggregates,35,36 should be noticed. The porphyrins used in this study possess different self-aggregation properties. Fig. S7† shows BL4(Cu) precipitates obtained from the well-dissolved ODCB solution (20 mg mL−1) after standing for two days, which is not observed for BL3(Cu & NO2) solution even after half a year. The OM images in Fig. S8† clearly demonstrate that the porphyrin aggregation (black spots) in the blend film becomes obvious with the solution aging time in the case of BL4 (a0–a2), which is not observed for BL3 (b0–b2). After 24 h annealing, more serious phase separation containing porphyrin (black spots) and PC61BM (short fibrils) aggregates is displayed for the BL4 blend film (A0–A2). In contrast, the blend film with BL3 always has a similar thermal stability (B0–B2). Here, it should be noticed that the chemical structure difference between BL3(Cu & NO2) and BL4(Cu) is only the β-substituted group, which probably indicates that the self-aggregation of metallized porphyrin could be effectively suppressed via periphery modification.
3.4 Photo-thermal stability of porphyrin and blend films
Porphyrin is often used in photodynamic therapy or as a photo-oxidation sensitizer,37 owing to its sensitivity to light. Moreover, porphyrin is easily oxidized, specifically when heated. In the present study, the porphyrin will be incorporated into the P3HT:PC61BM blend film to fabricate organic photoelectric devices, therefore, the photo-thermal stability of porphyrin itself and the P3HT:PC61BM:porphyrin blend film must be taken into consideration.

Fig. 6a shows the pictures of dilute porphyrin solutions in ODCB before and after illumination under a 3000 W m−2 metal halide lamp for 1 h. The temperature increases from 22 °C to 45 °C during illumination. The color of BL0(H), BL1(C4F8Cl), and BL5(Zn) solutions changes obviously, whereas BL2(NO2), BL3(Cu & NO2), BL4(Cu) and BL6(Ni) solutions undergo less color changes. More accurate and quantitative UV-visible analysis was further carried out (Fig. 6b and c), and the intensity decay of the characteristic Soret band for individual porphyrin within the range of 410–440 nm was calculated (Table S3†). This shows that BL3(Cu & NO2) and BL5(Zn) have the best and worst photo-thermal stability among these six porphyrins, respectively.
 Fig. 6  (a) Photographs of porphyrin solutions in ODCB, left and right vials are without and with 1 h illumination at 3000 W m−2 using the metal halide lamp, respectively. (b) and (c) are the UV-visible absorption spectra of porphyrin solutions with poor and good photo-stability, respectively. Open circle: before illumination and solid circle: after illumination. 
Taking BL0(H) as the reference, BL1(C4F8Cl) and BL2(NO2) are β-substituted porphyrins. It is well recognized that the electron-rich compound is readily subjected to oxidization and thus the strong electron-withdrawing group (–NO2, BL2) significantly increases the photo-thermal stability.38 Although –C4F8Cl is also an electron-withdrawing group, the cleavage of the C–Cl bond is easy to proceed under the C–F bond circumstance after irradiation,39,40 which is speculated to be responsible for the decreased photo-thermal stability. The stability of the metalized porphyrin in solution could be explained by the theoretical analysis of the Falk “stability factor” (the charge number of the metal ion, effective radius of the metal ion in Å and the Pauling electronegativity involved). According to the Falk equation, the stability of the complexes follows the order: Zn(II)–porphyrin ≪ Cu(II)–porphyrin ≈ Ni(II)–porphyrin,41 which is consistent with our experimental result (BL5(Zn) ≪ BL4(Cu) ≈ BL6(Ni)).
The photo-thermal stability of the P3HT:PC61BM:porphyrin blend film was also characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy. For clear observation of the porphyrin absorption peak and making the effect of porphyrin on the P3HT:PC61BM blend film significant, about 15.12% of porphyrin was selected. The spin-coated P3HT:PC61BM:porphyrin film was illuminated at 3000 W m−2 using the metal halide lamp for 55 h in a glovebox filled with nitrogen and subsequently at 250 W using a high-pressure mercury lamp for 1.5 h in ambient atmosphere to simulate the good- and bad-encapsulation conditions, respectively. The pictures of the instruments are shown in Fig. S9.† The UV-visible spectra before and after illumination in a glovebox completely coincide, indicating that illumination does not affect the P3HT:PC61BM blend films with or without porphyrins (Fig. 7a). In contrast, 1.5 h illumination in air dramatically degrades the P3HT and PC61BM components in the films because the characteristic absorption peaks of PC61BM at λ = 334 nm and those of P3HT at λ = 521, 544, and 601 nm disappear or decrease (Fig. 7b). Interestingly, porphyrin absorption at around 420 nm could still be observed although the intensity lowers to some extent, indicating the higher photo-thermal stability of porphyrin relative to P3HT and PC61BM.

At this stage, both the morphological and photo-thermal stabilities direct the electron-withdrawing group substituted (here, –NO2) and properly metallized porphyrin (here, Cu(II)) to be the most promising candidate for the P3HT:PC61BM system. In the following section, BL3(Cu & NO2) will continue to show its superiority in the efficiency and thermal stability of polymer photovoltaic devices.
3.5 Performance and thermal stability of devices
A series of devices based on P3HT:PC61BM blend films with different porphyrins were fabricated to investigate the effect of porphyrins on efficiency and thermal stability. An electron buffer layer (LiF) and an aluminum electrode were evaporated onto the active layer after thermal treatment. In this section, the “pristine” device means that the active layer was only thermally annealed at 130 °C for 25 min, the thermal stability of the device was investigated by isothermal annealing at the same temperature for different periods of time, and the device PCE was the average PCE obtained from 8 independent devices.

Fig. 8a shows the histogram of PCE variation (vs. annealing time) of devices loaded with different porphyrins, and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table S4.† These results indicate that although the introduction of most porphyrins (BL0–BL2 and BL6) decreases the device PCE (<3.05%), the addition of BL3(Cu & NO2) and BL5(Zn) does not cause any negative effects (3.22% and 3.25%, respectively), and the BL4(Cu) incorporation even increases the PCE to 3.34% relative to the reference device (without porphyrin, PCE = 3.20%). The increased PCE was also reported for P3HT:PC61BM solar cells loaded with Cu-metallized porphyrin by Lyons et al.,42 which is speculated to be related to the Förster energy transfer and more balanced charge mobility (data not shown).

After porphyrin addition, the thermal stability of the device is improved to different degrees. For example, the reference device maintains only 28.4% of the original PCE (3.20%) after 3 h thermal annealing at 130 °C, whereas >87.5% of PCE is retained for BL0(H), BL1(C4F8Cl), and BL2(NO2) devices, and even 60.6% is obtained for the worst porphyrin BL6(Ni). However, further thermal annealing up to 12 h severely decreases the device PCE (<53%), indicating that these porphyrins could only be effective for a short term. An encouraging result is realized for BL3(Cu & NO2), BL4(Cu), and BL5(Zn), in which the thermal stability is significantly increased. In particular, >92.6% and >68.3% of their individual original PCE are retained after thermal annealing for 3 and 12 h, respectively. Therefore, these three porphyrins show excellent long-term thermal stability.
The effect of porphyrin on the device performance is also closely related to the porphyrin content. Fig. S10 and Table S5† show the PCE curves over thermal annealing time and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the devices loaded with 7.56% of porphyrin, respectively. It is found that, on the one hand, the effect of porphyrins on PCE depends on the type of porphyrin: almost maintaining the PCE of the BL3(Cu & NO2) device from 3.22% to 3.32%, slightly decreasing the PCEs of BL4(Cu) and BL5(Zn) devices from 3.34% to 3.12% and from 3.25% to 2.99%, respectively. On the other hand, the improvement in the thermal stability is proportional to the porphyrin content: >90.0% of the original PCE (90.7% for BL3(Cu & NO2), 91.6% for BL4(Cu), and 97.3% for BL5(Zn)) is retained after 12 h thermal annealing (only higher than 68.3% is found for 3.78% of porphyrin). Encouragingly, as high as 2.76% of PCE is still realized for the BL3(Cu & NO2) device even after 48 h of thermal annealing. It should also be noted from Fig. S10 and Table S5† that, although the lower porphyrin content (3.78%) shows almost the same effect on the device PCE (3.22–3.34%), the increased porphyrin content enlarges the PCE difference from 2.99% of BL5 to 3.32% of BL3. Meanwhile, the BL3 shows a much better effect on thermal stability in comparison with BL4 and BL5. It is believed that, as the porphyrin amount increases, the properties of the bulk porphyrin, such as the self-aggregation of BL4(Cu) and the photo-stability of BL5(Zn), start to effectively influence the device performance.
From the data obtained above, we can see that the efficiency and thermal stability of the device depend not only on the porphyrin type, but also on the porphyrin content. One must take these two factors into consideration in practice.
To simulate the thermal stability in real application, a moderately accelerated thermal annealing at 60 °C for one month was carried out and the P3HT:PC61BM:3.78% BL3(Cu & NO2) blend film was selected, as shown in Fig. 8b and Table S6.† The PCE of the device based on the P3HT:PC61BM:BL3 blend film does not change before and after one month (3.22%), while that of the device without BL3 decreases from 3.20% to 2.86%. The parameters show that this decrease is mainly due to the short-current (Jsc) deterioration, which decreases from 8.83 mA cm−2 to 7.59 mA cm−2. The OM images in Fig. S11† show that large PC61BM aggregates appear in the P3HT:PC61BM film during this process, which brings negative impact on the exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport.
The effect of porphyrin on thermal stability is also demonstrated for the device based on the P3HT:PC71BM blend film, in which the P3HT:PC71BM:3.78%BL3(Cu & NO2) blend film was isothermally annealed at 150 °C, as shown in Fig. 9 and Table S7.† The PCE of the device without porphyrin dramatically decreases from 3.57% to 0.88% in 12 h. By contrast, the addition of 3.78% BL3(Cu & NO2) realizes 3.30% of PCE (93.7% of the original 3.52%) during this period, and as high as 2.21% of PCE is retained after 32 h. This shows that the BL3(Cu & NO2) incorporation is much more effective for improving the thermal stability of P3HT:PC71BM than the P3HT:PC61BM system, which is speculated to be related to the larger binding constant43–45 and difficult crystallization of PC71BM,46 and the increased Tg of the P3HT:PC71BM blend film.47

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, the strategy of incorporating porphyrin to enhance the performance of PSCs was further improved by understanding the chemical structure of porphyrin. The following guidelines for a better device PCE and thermal stability could be drawn: (1) β-substitution of non-metallized porphyrin is unfavorable due to the decreased planarity; (2) metallized porphyrin is generally better than the non-metallized one; and (3) the weak self-aggregation and high photothermal stability of porphyrin are beneficial for stabilizing the morphology. Based on these guidelines, the electron-withdrawing group (–NO2)-substituted and Cu-metallized porphyrin, i.e. BL3, is the most promising candidate for the P3HT:PC61BM system. Introduction of different amounts of BL3 (3.78% and 7.56%) not only reaches the PCEs (3.22% and 3.32%) that are comparable to or even higher than that of the pristine device (3.20%), but also significantly improves the thermal stability. After thermal annealing at 130 °C, 7.56% of BL3 retains 83% of its initial PCE after 48 h, whereas the pristine device retains only about 28.4% after 3 h. The addition of 3.78% BL3 maintains the device PCE for one month at 60 °C. This strategy is also found to be feasible for the P3HT:PC71BM system. The results obtained in this study not only provide researchers with a valuable criterion for material design and synthesis, but also show significant potential in PSC's commercialization due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness.
