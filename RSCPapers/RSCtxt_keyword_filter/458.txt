    , Accepted 16th August 2019First published on 19th August 2019AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been rapidly evolving as a promising candidate for next-generation photovoltaic technologies. P-type organics or polymers are generally used as hole transport materials (HTMs), which are expensive and non-sustainable for long-term applications. Herein, we demonstrate an inorganic Ni–Co–O hole conductor that displayed fast hole extraction and transport by the presence of gap states and relative high hole conductivity. Detailed structural inspection reveals that Co3+ and Ni2+ ions would reform into Co2+ and Ni3+ sites with the incorporation of Co, which contributes to greatly enhanced hole concentration. Inverted heterojunction devices based on NiCoOx hole transport layers yielded a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.03%, with 16.9% improvement compared with those based on NiOx layers (17.14%). This novel HTM with a facile synthesis process provides a new strategy for designing efficient carrier transport materials such that efficient charge collection and transport are achieved.
Introduction
The superior photophysical properties of metal halide perovskites (e.g. intense light absorption, long diffusion length and low exciton energy)1–6 are responsible for their high efficiency in solar cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 25%.7 To assist in the charge extraction and conduction from the perovskite thin film, additional charge transport layers are required. To date, most of the best-performing PSC devices with efficiencies over 20% have relied on doped organic or polymeric hole transport materials (HTMs), such as 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)8–10 and poly-triarylamine (PTAA).11,12 Unfortunately, these organic HTMs are costly and unstable for large-scale and long-term applications. Moreover, dopants, such as lithium-bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide, are necessary for these HTMs to offer sufficient hole mobility.
To address these issues, several inorganic-based p-type semiconductors have been explored as HTMs in the past few years, including metal oxides,13–18 metal sulfides,19–21 iodides22 and thiocyanates.23 Despite the electron blocking characteristics of p-type HTMs, a significant fraction of carriers may still recombine at the HTM/perovskite interface or in the bulk HTM layer before reaching the electrodes, thus limiting the device fill factor (FF) and the open-circuit voltage (Voc). Recently, time-resolved spectroscopic studies revealed that the hole extraction kinetics in the state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD layer can be further improved by incorporation of conductive carbon materials,24 which suggested that the photoexcited charge carriers must reduce chances of recombination. Therefore, the development of inorganic HTMs with excellent hole extraction and transport ability is critical to achieve a higher PCE.
Herein, a Ni–Co–O hole conductor has been developed as an inexpensive and solution-processable inorganic HTM for PSCs (Fig. 1). Ni–Co–O hole conductors are referred to NiOx, NiCoOx and CoOx with different Co and Ni ratios. We found that the incorporation of Co species into NiOx provided unique gap states above the valence band (VB) region, which can facilitate hole extraction from perovskite films. Furthermore, the formation of Ni and Co antisites with varied charge states could modify the electronic structure and improved the electrical conductivity of the HTM layer by over one order of magnitude. Owing to the large enhancement in the charge extraction and conductivity, the inverted planar PSC devices with NiCoOx HTM layers exhibited a champion PCE of 20.03%, which is significantly better than controls with NiOx layers (17.14%).

The occurrence of gap states in NiCoOx and CoOx could provide electronic pathways for hole transfer from perovskites. 
Results and discussion
The Ni–Co–O films in this work were prepared by a simple spin-coating process of Ni and Co precursors, followed by thermal annealing (see more details in Methods of ESI†). The concentration of all metal ions in the precursor solution was found to be 0.214 M, as determined by the performances of the resultant devices (Fig. S1†). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of the NiOx, NiCoOx and CoOx films revealed similar compact and surface morphologies (Fig. S2†). In order to investigate the structure of HTMs, we performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. Only the diffraction peaks of SnO2 from fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) can be observed in Fig. S3,† which indicates that the as-prepared Ni–Co–O materials are amorphous. Furthermore, the identities of these films were confirmed by Raman spectroscopy which showed the presence of CoOx and NiOx as evident from their signature Raman bands (Fig. S4†).
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy measurements were carried out to investigate the energy levels of the NiOx, NiCoOx and CoOx layers on FTO substrates. The optical band gaps of NiOx, NiCoOx and CoOx were measured to be 3.66, 2.70 and 2.30 eV, respectively (Fig. S5†). As shown in Fig. S6a,† the sample work functions were determined from their secondary electron cut-offs, and their valence band maximums were determined from the main on-set of photoelectrons. The energy levels of HTMs and the perovskite layer (Fig. S6b†) show that the Fermi levels of NiCoOx (−4.39 eV) and CoOx (−4.38 eV) layers are higher compared to those of pristine NiOx (−4.07 eV) and are accompanied by lowering of their VB edges (with respect to the vacuum level). Most intriguingly, apparent broadening of VB edges for the Co-containing samples can be observed, which suggests the existence of gap states. The edges of these gap states are located at ∼0.44 and ∼0.59 eV below the Fermi level for NiCoOx and CoOx, respectively. Assuming that these gap states are normally distributed, the energy levels of these states are centered at about −5.40 and −5.49 eV for NiCoOx and CoOx, both of which are well aligned to the VB of MAPbI3 (Fig. 1b and S6b†).
Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements (Fig. S7†) were then performed to reveal the charge transfer behaviors of different HTM layers. With the presence of Co species in HTM layers, PL quenching behavior in the perovskite films was dramatic in which the PL intensity of NiCoOx and CoOx samples were ∼8.6% and ∼3.4% relative to that of NiOx, at an excitation wavelength of 515 nm (Fig. S7a†). As shown in Fig. S7b,† the TRPL decay of perovskite films with different HTM layers showed a bi-exponential decay with a fast component and a slow component and was fitted to a biexponential equation: Y = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2).25 We attributed the quenching of the fast decay process to fast charge transfer from perovskite to the hole conductor layers and the slow decay to bimolecular radiative recombination. Evidently, the HTM layers had a major influence on the fast decay process which we attributed to the matching energy level alignment between the gap states induced by Co species and the perovskite layer, thus facilitating charge transfer at the interface. The fast decay lifetime of NiCoOx and CoOx samples was calculated to be 4.5 and 2.7 ns, which is 4.8 and 8.0 times faster than that of the NiOx sample (21.7 ns). Additionally, the NiOx, NiCoOx and CoOx samples displayed similar slow decay lifetimes of 22.6, 23.6 and 27.3 ns, respectively, suggesting that the HTM layers did not affect radiative recombination velocity in the perovskite films.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to probe the surface electronic structure of Ni–Co–O HTM samples. As shown in Fig. 2a, the Ni 2p3/2 peaks can be resolved into three distinct components which are consistent with previous reports for NiOx films obtained via solution methods. The peaks centered at a binding energy of ∼853.2 eV and ∼855.1 eV are attributed to Ni2+ and Ni3+, respectively.26,27 It is noteworthy that the atomic ratio of Ni3+ was increased from ∼63.7% of the NiOx film to ∼78.7% of the NiCoOx film determined by the integral area of XPS peaks. The XPS spectra of Co 2p (Fig. 2b) show four fitted peaks at binding energies of ∼778.9, ∼780.7, ∼794.2 and ∼795.9 eV, which correspond to Co3+ 2p3/2, Co2+ 2p3/2, Co3+ 2p1/2 and Co2+ 2p1/2, respectively.28 The Co3+:Co2+ ratios for the NiCoOx and CoOx are estimated to be 0.50 and 0.61, respectively. These observations suggest that Ni atoms may occupy Co3+ sites and lead to higher Ni3+ but lower Co3+ ratios in the NiCoOx film. The O 1s high-resolution spectra (Fig. S8†) show four distinct components of O1, O2, O3 and O4 ascribed to metal–oxygen bonds, OH– groups, defect sites with low oxygen coordination, and multiplicity of physi- and chemi-sorbed water, respectively.26,29–32

Notes: the intensities of Ni foil and Co foil in (e and f) were reduced by half. The xy dimensions of the analyzed area of the films are 100 × 100 μm2. 
To further investigate into the bulk electronic structures, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra were collected. The pre-edge of NiCoOx films in the Ni K-edge spectra shifted to higher absorption energy compared to NiO and NiOx samples, revealing higher bulk valence states than Ni2+ (Fig. 2c). Meanwhile, the bulk valence of Co species in NiCoOx resembles that of Co3O4 and CoOx controlled samples (Fig. 2d). In addition, the Fourier-transforms (FTs) of the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectra of all the samples were collected and analyzed. Interatomic distances are shorter owing to the fact that FT spectra were not phase-corrected. In Fig. 2e, the first (at ∼1.5 Å) and second (at ∼2.5 Å) peaks can be attributed to the single scattering paths of Ni–O and the closest neighboring transition metals around absorbing Ni atoms (Ni–Ni), respectively. It is noted that the third peak (at ∼3.0 Å) can only be observed in NiCoOx films, suggesting that the closest neighboring transition metals of Ni atoms consisted of two different types of bond distances (Ni–Ni or Ni–Co bonds), while in the Co K-edge range, three FT peaks located at ∼1.5 Å, ∼2.5 Å and ∼3.0 Å can be attributed to Co–O, Co–Co and Co–Ni, respectively (Fig. 2f). This phenomenon suggests that the closest neighboring atoms of Co atoms in NiCoOx are similar to Co3O4 and CoOx samples. The enhanced bulk valence states of Ni in NiCoOx films are in agreement with the results of the XPS analysis. Hence, we can reasonably conclude that more Ni3+ sites were formed at the expense of the Co3+ sites.
Solar cells with various sandwiched HTM layers were fabricated with an inverted planar heterojunction configuration [FTO/HTM/MAPbI3/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag]. The UV-vis absorbance spectra of perovskite films deposited on the different HTM layers exhibited a slight light absorbance efficiency decrease caused by incorporation of Co (Fig. S9†). The J–V curves of the PSCs with different Co contents are shown in Fig. 3a, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1.† The NiOx device exhibited a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.71 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.035 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.730, yielding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.14%. With the increase of Co from 25% to 50%, the highest recorded Jsc, Voc, and FF of the resulted devices improved from 21.95 to 22.27 mA cm−2, 1.045 to 1.080 V and 0.780 to 0.833, respectively, improving the PCE from 17.89% to 20.03%. Further increase of the Co content resulted in poorer performance: the PCE of devices with 75% Co content reduced to 17.12%, whereas the pure CoOx devices produced a low efficiency of only 9.95%.

(c) J–V curves (reverse and forward scans) of the best NiCoOx device with a Co content of 50%. All J–V measurements were carried out under AM 1.5G irradiation with a reverse scan rate of 0.15 V s−1 for small-area (0.0625 cm−2) devices. 

Fig. 3b shows the J–V metrics for 15 independent devices. A similar trend was observed for species: Voc values are 1.038, 1.039, 1.068, 0.943 and 0.974 V and the mean FF are 0.699, 0.768, 0.785, 0.769 and 0.452 with the Co contents of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively. The results clearly show the synergistic improvement of HTM performance with the optimized 50% CoOx and NiOx content in which the role of Co is to optimize charge transfer at the interface and enhance the FF and Voc as expected. On the other hand, NiOx also plays an equal important role, which may be related to charge transport and reduction of the surface trap states.33,34
The champion PCE of 20.03% was achieved by using the NiCoOx layer with a Jsc of 22.27 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.080 V, and FF of 83.3% under forward and reverse scanning with negligible hysteresis, as shown in Fig. 3c. The Jsc of the device was also confirmed by external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, with an integrated photocurrent of 21.2 mA cm−2 (Fig. S10†). Furthermore, this NiCoOx device was held at a forward bias of 0.894 V to monitor the stability of the power output as a function of time (Fig. S11†). The photocurrent stabilized within seconds to a value of approximately 21.23 mA cm−2 that is similar to that obtained by the J–V tests. A stabilized PCE of 18.99% was measured upon 100 s.
For photovoltaic devices, charge transport loss in bulk carrier transport layers could be another key factor to evaluate a hole transport layer and thus it is critical to examine the electrical conductivity of the HTM films. All electrical conductivity tests are conducted based on the structure of FTO/HTM/Au under dark conditions. The conductivity of the NiOx film was estimated to increase over one order of magnitude from ∼1.8 × 10−7 S m−1 to ∼2.5 × 10−6 S m−1 by substituting 50% of Ni with Co species in the precursors (Fig. 4a). Interestingly, the CoOx film was found to exhibit a low electrical conductivity of ∼3.8 × 10−8 S m−1. Mott–Schottky plots of the oxide films are generated based on the capacitances under AC conditions (Fig. 4b). All three samples show obvious p-type electrical characteristics. The carrier density can be calculated according to the following equation:35 N = (2/e0εε0A2)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1(1)where e0 is the electron charge, ε is the dielectric constant, ε0 is the permittivity of vacuum, N is the carrier density, and C is the capacitance derived from the electrochemical impedance. The carrier density of NiOx of 2.1 × 1018 cm−3 is lower comparable to that of CoOx films of 6.1 × 1018 cm−3, whereas, the carrier density of NiCoOx is significantly larger (10.2 × 1018 cm−3) approaching the carrier density of metallic materials (>1019 cm−3).

Insets show the corresponding electrical conductivity extracted from the J–V results. (b) C–V profiling of NiOx, NiCoOx and CoOx films. (c and d) Nyquist plots and recombination resistance (Rrec) of devices based on NiOx, NiCoOx and CoOx HTM layers. 
We continued to measure the devices under operational conditions using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to identify the recombination behavior in devices and the typical Nyquist plots of perovskite devices based on different HTMs are depicted in Fig. 4c. The experimental data were fitted using the equivalent circuit shown in the inset in Fig. 4c. The Nyquist plots typically show two distinct arcs at low and high frequencies for perovskite devices. Rs is an additional contribution from series resistance.36 The high frequency arc in the Nyquist plots is ascribed to the diffusion of holes through the HTM layer which is modeled by using a charge transfer resistance (Rtr) and chemical capacitance (Ctr). The lower frequency arc is ascribed to the recombination resistance (Rrec) and chemical capacitance (Cμ) which are associated with the recombination of the carriers in the whole device. Normally, the Rtr is almost indistinguishable due to the simplified transmission line model.
The Rrec at different applied bias voltages extracted from the Nyquist plots is listed in Fig. 4d. The Rrec of the NiCoOx based devices is much larger than that of the CoOx devices, indicating that the carriers' lifetime is much shorter (about 1–2 order of magnitude) than that of the NiCoOx devices. Based on the aforementioned results, we concluded that excess Co contents generate the trap states, which cause quick charge recombination and large electrical resistance. Co also improves the charge transfer rate at the HTL/perovskite interface, benefiting from the existence of suitable gap states. On the other hand, the incorporation of moderate amounts of Co into NiOx can substantially not only enhance interfacial charge transfer by introducing gap states, but also improve the hole concentration and electrical conductivity without obvious reduction of carrier lifetime.
Conclusions
In this study, we demonstrated a new type of hole conductor Ni–Co–O, which enables gap state assisted charge extraction and electrical transport capacities. Devices based on NiCoOx layers showed a high PCE of 20.03% with 16.9% enhancement compared with those based on conventional NiOx layers because of accelerated charge collection and transport. Further improvement of the crystallinity and morphology of Ni–Co–O based materials is expected to improve the carrier scattering time and mobility. We believe that such a material system holds great promise in developing low-cost and high-performance perovskite devices and is highly compatible with other electronic devices, such as photoreactors, light-emitting diodes and organic photovoltaics.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Device structure of perovskite solar cells. (b) Energy-level diagrams of perovskite solar cells (relative to the vacuum level). The dashed line shows the Fermi level of the hole conducting materials deposited on FTO glass. The occurrence of gap states in NiCoOx and CoOx could provide electronic pathways for hole transfer from perovskites.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a and b) XPS spectra of (a) Ni 2p and (b) Co 2p for the samples of CoOx and NiCoOx. XANES spectra in the range of (c) Ni K-edge and (d) Co K-edge for the samples of NiCoOx and controlled samples. Corresponding Fourier transforms of (e) Ni K-edge XAFS and (f) Co K-edge XAFS oscillations for the samples of NiCoOx and controlled samples. Notes: the intensities of Ni foil and Co foil in (e and f) were reduced by half. The xy dimensions of the analyzed area of the films are 100 × 100 μm2.	 

 	Fig. 3  Photovoltaic performance. (a) J–V curves of PSCs based on NiCoOx, films with different Co contents. (b) J–V metrics for 15 independent devices based on different HTM layers. (c) J–V curves (reverse and forward scans) of the best NiCoOx device with a Co content of 50%. All J–V measurements were carried out under AM 1.5G irradiation with a reverse scan rate of 0.15 V s−1 for small-area (0.0625 cm−2) devices.	 
N = (2/e0εε0A2)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1	(1)

 	Fig. 4  Charge carrier transport behavior. (a) J–V curves of NiOx, NiCoOx and CoOx films deposited on FTO glass. The thickness was 120 nm for all metal oxide films. Insets show the corresponding electrical conductivity extracted from the J–V results. (b) C–V profiling of NiOx, NiCoOx and CoOx films. (c and d) Nyquist plots and recombination resistance (Rrec) of devices based on NiOx, NiCoOx and CoOx HTM layers.
