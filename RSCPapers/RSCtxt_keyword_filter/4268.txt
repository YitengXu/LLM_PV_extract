    , Accepted 21st December 2022First published on 29th December 2022AbstractPhase instability seriously hinders the application of inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs), especially under elevated temperature. Herein, we developed a novel strategy, namely intermediate treatment (IT), to clothe the CsPbI3 perovskite in a robust phase-pure armor to boost its thermal stability. During the IT process, instead of the post-treatment (PT) of the CsPbI3 perovskite, the quinuclidin-1-ium iodide (QCDI) solution was employed to treat the intermediate phase DMAPbI3. At the following annealing stage, a thin but robust 1D QCDPbI3 outer layer was formed via ion exchange between the QCD+ and DMA+ ions. Such outer layer stabilized the CsPbI3 perovskite phase well by serving as a protecting layer and reducing the grain size. As a result, the IT-CsPbI3 perovskite maintained black phase after heating at 85 °C for 120 h, while the pristine CsPbI3 film deteriorated seriously after 24 h. The IT-CsPbI3 PSCs based on a carbon electrode (C-PSCs) retained over 85% of the initial efficiency after 200 h of heating at 85 °C in an N2 glovebox and maintained almost unchanged efficiency in dry air for 150 days. In addition, the IT strategy improved the film morphology well and passivated the defect states effectively. Consequently, the IT-CsPbI3 C-PSC achieved a record efficiency (16.64%) among inorganic C-PSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become one of the most attractive candidates among photovoltaic devices1–6 and have reached a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.7%.7 However, the chemical decomposition of organic components under harsh conditions hinders their practical application.8–16 Inorganic carbon-based perovskite solar cells (C-PSCs) that use inorganic perovskite as the light absorber and carbon electrode as the hole extraction electrode have shown great promise in addressing the above issues.17–21 Since inorganic perovskites avoid the utilization of volatile organic cations, while carbon materials are stable, inert to ion migration, and inherently water-resistant,22–25 inorganic C-PSCs exhibit well-enhanced device stability.26–28
Among inorganic perovskites, CsPbI3 shows great prospect due to its suitable direct bandgap (Eg ∼ 1.7 eV), enhanced thermal stability and solution processability. However, the photoactive perovskite phases of CsPbI3 are not stable and tend to spontaneously convert into the non-perovskite δ-phase, seriously deteriorating the photovoltaic performance.29 To address this issue, a wide variety of strategies have been developed,30–37 among which organic molecular engineering is the most straightforward and effective approach, which can be implemented by directly incorporating large organic molecules into the CsPbI3 precursor solution or post-treating the CsPbI3 layer with a solution containing organic molecules. The former strategy introduces low-dimensional structures into the whole CsPbI3 layer, which would well-enhance phase stability and passivate defects while hindering charge transport and hence lowering device performance. The post treatment method usually leads to the formation of an ultrathin organic molecule layer rather than a low-dimensional perovskite because it is hard to extract Cs+ ions from CsPbI3 to form a new phase. Consequently, the post treatment mainly plays a role in passivating surface defects instead of enhancing phase stability. Therefore, it is a challenge to develop a facile, controllable and efficient strategy to stabilize the CsPbI3 perovskite.
In previous studies, organic heterobicyclic salts, such as quinuclidin-1-ium iodide (QCDI) and its derivatives, have been mainly used in metal-free hexagonal perovskite high-energetic materials and three-dimensional perovskite ferroelectrics, while they have barely been applied in photovoltaics. In our previous work, the incorporation of a small amount of piperazine-1,4-diium iodide demonstrated great enhancement in the thermal stability of the CsPbI3 perovskite by forming a RP 2D structure.38 Very recent research shows that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2] octane-1,4-diium iodide can improve the PCE and stability by introducing low-dimensional crystals.39 These works motivated us to introduce QCDI in the CsPbI3 perovskite to further improve the efficiency and stability of CsPbI3 PSCs.
Herein, we developed a novel strategy, namely intermediate treatment (IT), to incorporate large organic molecules into the CsPbI3 perovskite for boosting phase stability. In contrast to the conventional post-treatment (PT) of the CsPbI3 perovskite, the IT process was implemented in the intermediate phase (DMAPbI3). By treating the DMAPbI3 intermediate phase with the QCDI solution, a thin but robust QCDPbI3 outer layer was formed by ion exchange between the QCD+ and DMA+ ions during the following annealing stage, which regulated the growth behavior of the CsPbI3 crystals and stabilized the phase structure. As a result, the IT-CsPbI3 perovskite exhibited robust phase stability and maintained the black phase after heating at 85 °C for 120 h. In addition, the QCDPbI3 outer layer could also considerably reduce the density of defects, which enhanced the PCE of the CsPbI3 C-PSC to 16.64%, a new record among inorganic C-PSCs.
Results and discussion
The precursor solution system of dimethyl ammonium iodide (DMAI), PbI2 and CsI was used to deposit the CsPbI3 perovskite films. As reported in our previous work, the DMAPbI3 and Cs4PbI6 intermediates would first be formed during the annealing process, which would then be converted to the CsPbI3 perovskite.40 In this work, instead of treating the final CsPbI3 perovskite film, the intermediate film formed after annealing the spin-coated film at 100 °C was treated with the QCDI solution (Fig. 1a). The treated intermediate film was then annealed at 220 °C to obtain the CsPbI3 film, denoted as the IT-CsPbI3 film. The QCDI molecule contains an amine group and two rings that share a pair of bridgehead carbon atoms (Fig. S1a†). To exclude the influence of the solvent, the CsPbI3 film obtained by annealing the intermediate film treated with isopropanol was prepared and denoted as the pristine CsPbI3 film. For comparison, a CsPbI3 film post-treated with the QCDI solution (denoted as PT-CsPbI3 film) was also prepared (Fig. S1b†).

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Fig. 1b and S2† indicate strong peaks for all CsPbI3 films at 14.2° and 28.7°, which could be assigned to the (110) and (220) planes of the CsPbI3 perovskite (p-CsPbI3: β or γ phase), respectively, indicating the formation of the CsPbI3 perovskite. The peak intensity of p-CsPbI3 for the IT-CsPbI3 film was obviously higher than that for the pristine CsPbI3 film, implying superior crystallinity. Compared with the pristine CsPbI3 film, a new peak was detected at ∼9.9° for the IT-CsPbI3 film. This new peak could be assigned to the characteristic peak of the QCDPbI3 compound, as shown in the XRD pattern of the film prepared by using PbI2 and QCDI, proving the existence of QCDPbI3 in the IT-CsPbI3 film. For the PT-CsPbI3 film, no QCDPbI3 peak was observed. Instead, an additional peak at ∼17.6° was found, which could be assigned to the characteristic peak of the QCDI crystals. Therefore, the PT method did not induce the generation of QCDPbI3, suggesting high difficulty in exchanging Cs+ ions in the CsPbI3 perovskite with the organic QCD+ ions. Furthermore, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicated almost no N signal for the pristine CsPbI3 film, while the IT-CsPbI3 film showed an obvious N peak (Fig. 1c), which could be attributed to the introduction of QCDPbI3. Meanwhile, compared with the pristine CsPbI3 film, both Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2 peaks shifted toward lower binding energies, while no obvious shift of the Cs 3d and I 3d peaks was observed (Fig. S3†), probably due to changes in the chemical surroundings between the CsPbI3 perovskite and QCDPbI3 (Fig. 1d).
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Fig. S4a† showed a clear rod-shaped structure for QCDPbI3 with a uniform radius of ∼150 nm, and elements C, Pb, I, and N were uniformly distributed throughout the rods (Fig. S4b–e†). The SEM images exhibited considerably different surface morphologies for the pristine CsPbI3, IT-CsPbI3 and PT-CsPbI3 films (Fig. 1e and S5†). For the pristine CsPbI3 film, the morphology was similar to the films reported in our previous works, and the grain size was about hundreds of nanometers. The bright sheet-like crystals seen at the grain boundaries should be PbI2 crystals. Compared with the pristine CsPbI3 film, the IT-CsPbI3 film was smoother and more compact. Meanwhile, the grain size was reduced, and no PbI2 crystal was observed. In sharp contrast, the PT-CsPbI3 film displayed a much rougher surface, and many rectangular crystals which could be identified as QCDI crystals appeared on the surface. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images in Fig. S6† further confirmed the smooth surface of the IT-CsPbI3 film and the rough surface of the PT-CsPbI3 film. Additionally, the distribution of QCDPbI3 across the film thickness and surface of the IT-CsPbI3 film was revealed by the time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectral (TOF-SIMS) measurements. As indicated, the QCD+ ions mainly accumulated on the top surface of the CsPbI3 layer (Fig. 1f) and were uniformly distributed on the entire film surface (Fig. 1g), demonstrating that QCDPbI3 served as a capping layer.
To study the crystallization kinetics, the XRD patterns (Fig. 2a) of the pristine CsPbI3 and IT-CsPbI3 films at different annealing stages (≤5 min) were recorded and compared in detail. As indicated in Fig. S7,† the intermediate film (annealed at 100 °C) only exhibited the diffraction peaks of DMAPbI3 (11.6°) and Cs4PbI6 (11.9° and 28.6°). After annealing at 220 °C for 10 s, no obvious change was found in the XRD pattern of the pristine CsPbI3 film, while a faint peak of QCDPbI3 at 9.9° appeared for the IT-CsPbI3 film. In addition, the DMAPbI3 peak of the IT-CsPbI3 film was also weakened, implying the partial conversion of DMAPbI3 to QCDPbI3. To confirm this hypothesis, we prepared pure DMAPbI3 and Cs4PbI6 films and treated them with the QCDI solution. As shown in Fig. 2b and c, QCDI treatment of the DMAPbI3 film resulted in the appearance of a QCDPbI3 peak and weakening of the DMAPbI3 peak, while almost no change was observed in the XRD pattern of the Cs4PbI6 film. Therefore, the formation of QCDPbI3 on the IT-CsPbI3 film mainly originated from the conversion of DMAPbI3 to QCDPbI3via ion exchange between the DMA+ and QCD+ ions. The fact that no QCDPbI3 was formed on the Cs4PbI6 film demonstrated that the ion exchange between the Cs+ and QCD+ ions was sluggish, which was further confirmed by the fact that no QCDPbI3 was produced on the PT-CsPbI3 film.

With prolonged annealing duration, the DMAPbI3 and Cs4PbI6 peaks gradually weakened, while the p-CsPbI3 peaks (14.2° and 28.8°) became intense, suggesting the conversion of DMAPbI3 and Cs4PbI6 to p-CsPbI3. To visually describe the differences in the DMAPbI3 and p-CsPbI3 components between the pristine CsPbI3 and IT-CsPbI3 films, the integrated intensities of the diffraction peaks of DMAPbI3 (11.6°) and p-CsPbI3 (14.2°) were extracted from the XRD patterns and plotted, as shown in Fig. 2d. Compared with the pristine CsPbI3 film, the IT-CsPbI3 film showed lower integrated intensity of DMAPbI3 during the annealing process, but the two films exhibited an identical increasing tendency of the integrated intensity of the p-CsPbI3 peaks. This could be attributed to the partial consumption of DMAPbI3 for the conversion to QCDPbI3, while the conversion of the intermediates to p-CsPbI3 was hardly affected by the QCDPbI3 outer layer.
To better evaluate the component changes in the IT-CsPbI3 film during annealing, the changes in the integrated intensity of the DMAPbI3 (11.6°), p-CsPbI3 (14.2°) and QCDPbI3 (9.9°) peaks were plotted, as seen in Fig. 2e. At the initial annealing stage, the QCD+ ions tended to exchange with the surface DMA+ ions of DMAPbI3 to form QCDPbI3 (eqn (1)), as illustrated in Fig. 2f. Since the increase in the integrated intensity of the QCDPbI3 (9.9°) peak was not obvious after annealing for tens of seconds, it could be inferred that the QCD+ ions reacted with DMAPbI3 very easily. With increasing annealing duration, DMAPbI3 gradually combined with Cs4PbI6 to form p-CsPbI3 (eqn (2)), and at around 5 min, DMAPbI3 was hardly left, and the p-CsPbI3 peak almost reached the highest value. DMAPbI3 + QCDI → DMAI↑ + QCDPbI3(1) DMAPbI3 + Cs4PbI6 → DMAI↑ + p-CsPbI3(2)
As previously reported, p-CsPbI3 is prone to transition to δ-CsPbI3 after most of the intermediates (DMAPbI3 and Cs4PbI6) were converted during annealing at around 200 °C, due to which the annealing time window for high-quality p-CsPbI3 is limited to a few minutes. As shown in Fig. 3a–c, in the pristine CsPbI3 film, after the intermediates were mostly converted to p-CsPbI3 by annealing at 220 °C for 5 min, δ-CsPbI3 appeared as the annealing duration was extended to 10 min even when the DMAPbI3 peak could still be detected (Fig. 3d). Since DMAPbI3 would inhibit electron transport due to mismatched energy levels, the residue in p-CsPbI3 is detrimental to device performance.40 Therefore, it is still a great challenge to grow high-quality p-CsPbI3 films with less DMAPbI3 and δ-CsPbI3 by the pristine method. Surprisingly, a totally different phenomenon was observed for the IT-CsPbI3 film. As indicated in Fig. 3d, no DMAPbI3 peak was detected after annealing for 5 min, but the p-CsPbI3 peak was well-maintained even after annealing for 30 min. This is because some DMAPbI3 could be converted to QCDPbI3 by ion exchange between the QCD+ and DMA+ ions, which is favorable for reducing the DMAPbI3 residue. Besides, the QCDPbI3 outer layer could effectively suppress the transition of p-CsPbI3 to δ-CsPbI3 (Fig. 3e). Therefore, treating the intermediate film with QCDI broadens the processing window to grow high-quality p-CsPbI3 films without DMAPbI3 and δ-CsPbI3 impurities.

To further evaluate the difference in phase stability, the pristine CsPbI3 and IT-CsPbI3 films were heated at 85 °C in a nitrogen glovebox. As indicated in Fig. 4a and S10,† the pristine CsPbI3 film gradually turned yellow after 16 h of heating, while the IT-CsPbI3 film remained dark brown even after 120 h of heating, showing significantly enhanced thermal stability. In addition, when exposed to 90% relative humidity at room temperature for 20 min, the pristine CsPbI3 film turned yellow soon, but the IT-CsPbI3 film retained the original black (Fig. S11a†), which further confirmed the improved resistance to moisture-induced phase transition. Forming low-dimensional structures by incorporating large organic molecules is beneficial to stabilizing p-CsPbI3, which usually results in superior stability against moisture and higher thermal stress. As indicated in Fig. S11b,† the IT-CsPbI3 film exhibited a larger contact angle of 73.6° than the pristine CsPbI3 film (57.8°), suggesting greater hydrophobic characteristics after the intermediate treatment. Therefore, the low-dimensional QCDPbI3 outer layer acts as a protective armor to enhance the phase stability of p-CsPbI3 by isolating the p-CsPbI3 crystals from external conditions.
In addition to the armor role, other positive impacts induced by the IT strategy may have also contributed to the enhanced phase stability. The XRD patterns of the ITx-CsPbI3 films (x represents the concentration of the QCDI solution; x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg mL−1) in Fig. 4b indicate that the characteristic peaks of p-CsPbI3 gradually shift to higher degrees with increasing x (Table S1†), implying reduced lattice constants and compressed unit cell volume. Based on the calculation, the d-spacing of the (110) plane shrinked from 3.141 Å at x = 0 to 3.127 Å at x = 1.0 (Fig. 4c, Table S2†). Besides, the average crystal size of p-CsPbI3 calculated using the Debye–Scherrer equation gradually reduced with x (Fig. S12†). The statistical grain sizes (Fig. 4d and Table S3†) obtained from the SEM images (Fig. S13†) showed a similar trend to the results calculated from the XRD patterns. This led to the speculation that the QCDPbI3 outer layer formed in situ on the CsPbI3 crystal might impose a spatial constraint to hinder the in-plane volume increase of the CsPbI3 grains, which would reduce the lattice constant and grain size. As previously reported, when the grain size decreased, the surface formation energy of p-CsPbI3 became lower than that of δ-CsPbI3. The difference in the surface formation energy would compensate for the conversion energy of δ-CsPbI3 to p-CsPbI3. Consequently, δ-CsPbI3 was effectively suppressed.

In addition, biaxial tensile strain is crucial for stabilizing the black phase in solution-processed CsPbI3 films.41 The residual tensile strains of the ITx-CsPbI3 films were calculated using the Williamson–Hall analysis method by plotting βcosθ versus 4sinθ from the XRD patterns (Fig. S15†), where β is the peak width. As seen, the residual tensile strain in the CsPbI3 lattice decreased from 2.42 × 10−3 for the pristine CsPbI3 film to 0.32 × 10−3 for the IT1.5-CsPbI3 film, which is unfavorable for phase stability. Therefore, it could be concluded that the global enhancement in the phase stability of p-CsPbI3 should be mainly attributed to the bifunctional effects of the armor role of the QCDPbI3 layer and the reduced grain size of p-CsPbI3.
The optoelectronic properties of the different CsPbI3 perovskite films were further studied. The UV-vis spectra in Fig. 5a indicate that the QCDI treatment did not change the absorption edges of the CsPbI3 perovskite located at ∼737 nm (∼1.68 eV), which is consistent with the previously reported values.42 As expected, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra in Fig. 5b showed almost no variation in PL peak positions after the QCDI treatment. These results demonstrate that the QCDI treatment mainly formed QCDPbI3, and almost no QCD+ ion was doped into the lattice of the CsPbI3 perovskite. In addition, the intensity of the PL peaks gradually increased with the QCDI amount, implying a gradual reduction in defect density. The time-resolved PL (TRPL) curves in Fig. 5c exhibit the faster decay of the PL signal of the pristine CsPbI3 film than that of the IT1.5-CsPbI3 film. After fitting, the carrier lifetimes (τ) in the pristine CsPbI3 and IT1.5-CsPbI3 films were about 5.51 and 34.97 ns, respectively (Table S4†), confirming the reduction of defects in the latter film. The confocal PL intensity mapping (Fig. 5d and e) manifested that the absolute PL intensity of the IT1.5-CsPbI3 film was significantly higher than that of the pristine CsPbI3 film, consistent with the steady-state PL and TRPL results.

To further confirm the above conclusion, electron-only devices with the structure of FTO/TiO2/CsPbI3/phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/carbon were fabricated and tested by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method under dark conditions (Fig. 5f). The current increased linearly as a function of voltage (indicating ohmic conduction) up to a kink, beyond which the current showed a rapid rise due to the filling of the trap states by the injected carriers. The voltage at the kink is known as the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL). The trap state density (Nt) was calculated by VTFL using eqn (3): VTFL=eNtL2/2εrε0(3)where e is the elementary charge, Nt is the trap state density, L is the film thickness, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, and εr is the relative permittivity of CsPbI3.43 As expected, the IT1.5-CsPbI3 film exhibited a lower trap state density (Nt = 1.016 × 1015 cm−3) than the pristine CsPbI3 film (Nt = 1.680 × 1015 cm−3), well-confirming the reduced defects.
CsPbI3 C-PSCs with the architecture of FTO/compact TiO2/meso-TiO2/CsPbI3/carbon were fabricated by directly painting commercial carbon paste on the perovskite films, followed by annealing at 100 °C. As indicated in Fig. 6a, close contact at the CsPbI3/carbon interface was formed. The statistical photovoltaic metrics in Fig. 6b show that the IT-CsPbI3 devices exhibited considerably enhanced performance in comparison with the pristine CsPbI3 devices, with the average PCE increasing from 13.9 ± 0.5% to 15.8 ± 0.8%, which was also superior to the PT-CsPbI3 devices (14.8 ± 0.8%) (Fig. S16a†). As indicated in Fig. 6c and S16b,† the champion CsPbI3 device displayed a PCE of 14.38% with a VOC of 1.087 V, JSC of 18.96 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.698, while the best PT-CsPbI3 device achieved a PCE of 15.59% with a VOC of 1.095 V, JSC of 18.58 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.766. Promisingly, the champion IT-CsPbI3 device obtained a VOC of 1.117 V, JSC of 18.81 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.792, resulting in a PCE of 16.64%, which is a new record for inorganic C-PSCs to the best of our knowledge. Compared with the pristine CsPbI3 and PT-CsPbI3 devices, the enhancement in the PCE of the IT-CsPbI3 devices mainly originates from the improvement in VOC and FF (Fig. S17†), which can be attributed to the improved film quality and defect passivation, leading to the suppression of charge recombination loss. The J–V curves obtained from the forward and reverse scans (Fig. S18a†) revealed that the IT-CsPbI3 device had small hysteresis, and the steady-state maximum power output curve exhibited stable power output (Fig. S18b†).

Performance comparison between the pristine CsPbI3 and IT1.5-CsPbI3 C-PSCs: (b) the statistical data of the PCEs; (c) the J–V curves, (d) VOC–I, (e) Mott–Schottky plots (obtained at 10 kHz), (f) TPV curves, (g) variation of the normalized PCE with time under heating at 85 °C in N2, and (h) the normalized PCE of the IT-CsPbI3 C-PSCs with time in dry air (temperature: 20–30 °C; relative humidity: 10–20%). 
Furthermore, the light intensity (I) dependence of VOC and JSC was recorded to reveal the recombination behavior. The recombination mechanism can be understood according to eqn (4) and (5): JSC ∝ Iα (α ≤ 1)(4) VOC = εkTln(I)/q + constant(5)where I is the light intensity, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, q is the elementary charge, and α and ε are the ideal factors. From the JSC–I curves in Fig. S18c,† the α values were fitted and calculated to be 0.924 and 0.988 for the pristine CsPbI3 and IT-CsPbI3 devices, respectively, demonstrating more effective charge separation and lower bimolecular recombination in the latter device. From the VOC–I curves in Fig. 6d, the ε values were calculated to be 7.07 and 2.11 for the pristine CsPbI3 and IT-CsPbI3 devices, respectively, which indicate that trap-assisted recombination had reduced substantially in the IT-CsPbI3 device, which was also well-supported by the PL and TRPL results. The Mott–Schottky plots in Fig. 6e show that the Vbi of the pristine CsPbI3 and IT-CsPbI3 devices were about 1.01 V and 1.11 V, respectively. The larger Vbi would lead to more efficient charge separation and collection, which are beneficial to obtain higher VOC and FF. Furthermore, the transient photocurrent decay (TPC) results in Fig. S18d† show that the decay time of the IT-CsPbI3 device was slightly decreased in comparison to the pristine CsPbI3 device, implying improved carrier transport. The transient photovoltage decay (TPV) results presented in Fig. 6f also show that the IT-CsPbI3 device underwent much slower decay and had a longer charge carrier lifetime than the CsPbI3 device, further confirming the suppression of carrier recombination.
The device stability was further studied by storing the unencapsulated CsPbI3 and IT-CsPbI3 C-PSCs under different conditions. As shown in Fig. 6g, the IT-CsPbI3 device maintained over 85% of its initial PCE after heating at 85 °C for 200 h, while the PCE of the CsPbI3 device degraded rapidly. After storing the IT-CsPbI3 device in the air atmosphere (relative humidity < 20%) for 150 days, almost no PCE degradation was found (Fig. 6h). Therefore, the QCDPbI3 layer on p-CsPbI3 well-enhanced phase and device stability.
Conclusion
We have developed a facile IT strategy to cover the CsPbI3 perovskite with a robust QCDPbI3 layer with a 1D structure. The QCDPbI3 layer was formed by ion exchange between the QCD+ and DMA+ ions during the annealing process. This outer layer well-stabilized the CsPbI3 perovskite phase by serving as a protective layer and reducing the grain size. The IT-CsPbI3 perovskite maintained the black phase after heating at 85 °C for 120 h, while the pristine CsPbI3 film seriously deteriorated after 24 h. The IT-CsPbI3 C-PSCs retained over 85% of the initial PCE after 200 h of heating at 85 °C in an N2 glovebox and maintained almost unchanged PCE in dry air (relative humidity < 20%) for 150 days. In addition, the IT strategy well-improved the film morphology and effectively passivated the defect states. Consequently, the IT-CsPbI3 C-PSC achieved a record PCE (16.64%) for inorganic C-PSCs.
