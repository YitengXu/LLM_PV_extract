Recently, great progress in the development of new photo-harvesting materials and device optimizations have been achieved in this field, resulting in the significant improvement of the power conversion efficiencies of polymer solar cells from around 1% to higher than 8.0%. The rational design and fine tailoring of the molecular structures of donor polymers significantly contributed to these prominent advances. Among all kinds of donor polymers, push–pull conjugated polymers, which consist of alternating electron-rich and electron-deficient units have been most extensively developed and have dominated the library of donor materials for polymer solar cells, because their intrinsic optical and electronic properties can be readily tuned to the desired situation by controlling the intramolecular charge transfer from donor unit to acceptor unit.

1. Introduction
Along with the diminishing reserve volume of fossil fuels and environmental problems caused by the use of fossil fuels, the need to develop renewable energy sources has become urgent in recent years. Photovoltaic technologies, such as solar cells, which can directly convert terrestrial solar radiation into electricity, have thus been regarded as one of the most promising approaches to solve these urgent issues. Silicon-based solar cells are the most mature photovoltaic technology to date with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 25%.1,2 Nevertheless, the high cost of silicon-based solar cells has limited their wide spread commercialization. Alternatively, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been rapidly developed as one of the most promising candidates for low-cost solar cells, due to their possibility of fabricating large-scale and flexible solar cells by solution processing.3–8 The most widely utilized device structure of PSCs involves the concept of bulk heterojunctions (BHJs), where a nanoscale phase separated blend of conjugated polymer donor and fullerene derivative acceptor was sandwiched between transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) and a metal electrode.9 Both conventional and inverted device architectures were developed for PSCs (see Fig. 1). In conventional devices, ITO and a low-work-function metal were used to collect holes and electrons, respectively, while modified ITO and a high-work-function metal were used as the electron-collecting electrode and the hole-collecting electrode, respectively, for inverted devices. The fundamental operating principle of BHJ-PSCs for both conventional and inverted devices is the photo-induced charge transfer between conjugated polymer donors and fullerene derivative acceptors.10 Generally, the energy conversion from light energy to electrical energy experienced five fundamental steps: 1) harvesting of photons by chromophores (donor or acceptor) to generate excitons, 2) diffusion of the excitons to the interface of the p-n junction, 3) dissociation of the excitons into free charge carriers, 4) transportation of the free charge carriers towards the corresponding electrodes, and 5) charge collection at electrodes.

In recent years, significant advances in PCEs of BHJ-PSCs have been achieved, benefiting from both material developments and device technologies.11–33 From a materials point of view, the development of donor polymers plays a more critical role in the recent progresses of BHJ-PSCs, due to the fact that the choice of acceptor materials is limited and actually, most state-of-the-art BHJ-PSCs utilized (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM, see Scheme 1) or (6,6)-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM, see Scheme 1) as acceptor phase.9,34,35 In principle, an ideal donor polymer for high performance BHJ-PSCs should possess the following properties simultaneously: 1) appropriate solubility and miscibility with acceptors to form the desired bi-continuous penetrating network in the active layers, 2) well-matched energies of the frontier levels between the polymer and acceptor (PC61BM or PC71BM) to guarantee sufficient driving force for efficient charge separation while maintaining a high open-circuit voltage (Voc), 3) broad absorption spectra coupled with a high extinction coefficient to match with the solar terrestrial radiation in the range of 300–1500 nm, with maximal flux at 690 nm, and to harvest as much solar photons, and 4) high hole mobility to efficiently transport charge carriers to the electrode.4,36 To satisfy these criteria, a large amount of new polymers have been developed by synthetic chemists as donor materials for BHJ-PSCs and, encouragingly, dramatic advances in the PCEs for BHJ-PSCs were thus achieved.12–21
 Scheme 1  The chemical structures of MEH-PPV, MDMO-PPV, P3HT, PC61BM and PC71BM. 
In early studies, homopolymers such as poly(2-methoxyl-5-((2′-ethylhexyl)oxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (MEH-PPV), poly(2-methoxyl-5-((3′,7′-dimethyloctyl)oxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (MDMO-PPV),37 and regioregular polythiophene derivatives (such as poly-(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)) (see Scheme 1)23,24 were usually applied as donor materials in BHJ-PSCs. However, the solar cell devices using these polymers usually delivered limited PCEs, which retarded the practical application of these materials in BHJ-PSCs. The relatively low PCEs of solar cells based on these polymers have been attributed to their narrow absorption spectra and non-ideal frontier molecular orbitals, which limited the short circuit current (Jsc) and Voc, respectively, in the resulting BHJ-PSCs. Therefore, the development of new photovoltaic materials with smaller optical band gaps (Eg) and suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels is crucial to further improve the PCEs of BHJ-PSCs. Push–pull conjugated polymers, or the so-called donor–acceptor (D–A) alternating conjugated polymers were thus extensively developed and have dominated the library of donor materials for PSCs because their intrinsic optical and electronic properties, including light-absorption ability and energy levels, can be tuned readily by controlling the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from donor unit to acceptor unit. Encouragingly, a PCE over 7% is now a normality in the research field of BHJ-PSCs and a record-high PCE of 8.5% was also achieved, mainly due to the successfully development of push–pull narrow band-gap (NBG) conjugated polymers.38–42 The principle of band gap and energy level manipulation by ICT interaction in push–pull conjugated polymers can be easily understood by molecular orbital theory. As depicted in Fig. 2, the HOMO of the donor segment will interact with that of the acceptor segment to generate two new occupied molecular orbitals after covalent bond connection of two different moieties, one of them is higher and the other one is lower than the two initial HOMOs before molecular orbital hybridization. Two new unoccupied molecular orbitals would also be generated in a similar manner after molecular orbital hybridization, where one is lower and the other is higher than the two initial LUMOs of the two moieties. Hence, the overall effect of this redistribution of frontier molecular orbitals is the formation of a higher-positioned HOMO and a lower-positioned LUMO in the whole conjugated main chain, and this accordingly leads to the narrowing of the band gap. Clearly, the rational selection of building blocks, including both donor units and acceptor units is critical to the realization of the well-defined control of the photophysical properties and frontier molecular orbital energy levels of the resulting copolymers to meet the requirements for BHJ-PSC applications. Therefore, various aromatic heterocycles were exploited or used as building blocks to develop highly efficient donor polymers for BHJ-PSC applications based on the push–pull design. Moreover, the fine tailoring of the structure (such as incorporation of functional groups onto the backbone, the selection of alkyl side chains, end capping and so forth) is also critical for obtaining high-performing donor polymers, although the nature of the conjugated backbone dominated the intrinsic electronic properties (especially band gaps, energy levels, and charge carrier transporting ability). It should be pointed out that conjugated polymers which consist of alternating electron-rich building blocks but can provide stable quinoidal structures are another class of state-of-the-art donor polymers for BHJ-PSCs, aside from push–pull conjugated polymers.15,43–52 BHJ-PSCs based on this kind of material even delivered unprecedented PCEs higher than 8.0% after meticulous device optimization.53 In this feature article, we will briefly summarize the important advances of push–pull conjugated polymers, which were used as the donor phase for high-efficiency BHJ-PSCs. Our emphasis will be placed mainly on how the materials' chemical structures influenced their properties, such as the absorption spectra, energy levels, mobilities and photovoltaic behaviors, based on the recently reported literature. This paper is thus by no means a comprehensive review and many papers have not been mentioned here. Although several published reviews have already summarized the major classes of conjugated polymer employed as donors in BHJ-PSCs, our goal in this mini-review is to provide some empirical regularities for the future design of efficient photovoltaic donor polymers by an in-depth analysis of the already reported results in this field. For more information on the topic of donor polymers in BHJ-PSCs, the reader is encouraged to read other extensive reviews.12–21

2. Push–pull conjugated polymers from important aromatic heterocycles
Push–pull conjugated polymers or the so-called “D–A conjugated polymers”, whose main chains were constructed from alternating donor units (D) and acceptor units (A), were widely developed as highly efficient donor materials in BHJ-PSCs because their light harvesting abilities and energy levels can be well tuned by controlling the photo-induced ICT from donor to acceptor units. The intrinsic optical and electronic properties of the resulting polymers were dominated by their subunits of constructing aromatic heterocycles. Therefore, different building units have significant influence on the final photovoltaic properties of the resulting polymers. Several reviews have already comprehensively summarized the major classes of push–pull conjugated polymers employed as donors in PSCs according to the classification of subunits.13,14,16–21 In this section, we will briefly summarize several important aromatic heterocyclic subunits and their corresponding push–pull conjugated polymers in BHJ-PSC applications. Generally, fluorene, silafluorene, carbazole, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]-dithiophene (BDT), cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT), dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]-silole (DTS), indacenodithiophene (IDT), etc. were used as donor units, while 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT), quinoxaline, thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD), pyrrolo[3,4-c]-pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP), etc. were used as acceptor units for constructing push–pull NBG photovoltaic materials.
2.1 The influence of acceptor units on push–pull conjugated polymers
BT is one of the most promising acceptor units for photovoltaic materials, due to its suitable electron withdrawing ability. Compared to other acceptor groups (such as thienopyrazine, thienothiadiazole, etc.), one of the advantages of BT is that it can preserve a relative low-positioned HOMO energy level in the resulting polymers, which will be beneficial for not only the chemical stability of the polymers but also for gaining a high Voc in the final solar cell devices.54,55 Since Dhanabalan et al. firstly reported the utilization of a BT-based push–pull conjugated polymer as the donor phase for BHJ-PSCs,56 BT has been extensively used as an acceptor unit to construct push–pull conjugated NBG polymers for BHJ-PSC applications.56–72 Encouragingly, a PCE as high as 7.2% was achieved for BHJ-PSCs using a BT-based push–pull conjugated NBG polymer as the donor phase.71 Amongst all the BT-based NBG conjugated polymers, P3, made up of alternating carbazole and dithienylbenzothiadiazole (DTBT) is a promising one (see Scheme 2), which exhibited an Eg of 1.88 eV and a deep-lying HOMO level of −5.5 eV. A PCE of 3.6% was firstly obtained for P3:PC61BM solar cells.62 After a series of meticulous device optimizations, the photovoltaic properties of P3 can be improved to a much higher level (over 6% PCE).53,73,74

The success of BT in constructing highly efficient push–pull NBG conjugated copolymers for BHJ-PSCs inspired chemists to exploit its analogues as building blocks for new photovoltaic donor polymers. Generally, there are three methods to modify BT rings. The first is the replacement of the 2-position sulfur atom with other heteroatoms, such as oxygen, selenium, nitrogen, carbon, etc.39,54,75–80 The second method is the replacement of the benzene ring in the BT unit with more electron-deficient heterocycles, such as pyridine and pyridazine.54,81 The third is the replacement of the hydrogen atoms in the 5,6-positions of BT with heteroatoms or groups, such as fluorine atoms and alkyloxyl chains.71,82–85 Notably, the two former methods of replacing the 2-position sulfur atom with other heteroatoms, or replacing the benzene ring with other heterocycles actually lead to new heterocyclic units and result in great changes in the conjugated backbones, having substantial effects on the optical and electronic properties of the resulting polymers.
If the 2-position sulfur atom of BT is substituted by an oxygen atom, a new acceptor unit of benzooxadiazole (BO) emerged. Relative to BT, BO usually leads to deeper-positioned HOMO levels in the resulting polymers because of the stronger electronegativity of the oxygen atom than that of the sulfur atom, contributing to the increased Voc in the related BHJ-PSCs. The push–pull NBG conjugated polymer (P4) of alternating BO and BDT, possessing a high number average molecular weight (Mn) of 47.2 kg mol−1 and good solubility in aromatic solvents, delivered a high Voc of 0.89 V, a high Jsc of 13.6 mA cm−2, and thereby a high PCE value of 6.05% in BHJ-PSCs.75 If the 2-position sulfur atom of BT is substituted by a selenium atom, another new acceptor unit of 2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole emerged. Since the selenium atom has a much larger size and a lower electronegativity than the sulfur atom, it would have significant influence on the optical and electronic properties of the resulting polymers. Yang et al. have demonstrated that benzoselenadiazole-based polymers offered red-shifted absorbance compared to their BT-based analogues.86 Zhao et al. have reported a push–pull NBG conjugated polymer (P5) of alternating carbazole and thiophene flanked benzoselenadiazole.76 As shown in Table 1, the Eg of P5 is 1.73 eV, which is obviously smaller than that of its BT-based counterpart P3 (1.88 eV). However, P5 possessed a higher-positioned HOMO level (−5.28 eV) than that of P3, resulting in a smaller Voc of 0.75 V for the related solar cell devices. The maximum PCE of P5:PC71BM based solar cells was 2.58%.76 The replacement of the sulfur atom in the BT unit with a nitrogen atom would lead to a new acceptor unit of benzotriazole (TAZ). Compared to BT, TAZ is less electron-deficient because the lone pair electron on the nitrogen atom is more basic than the lone pair on the sulfur atom and is thereby more easily donated into the triazole ring. Therefore, the band gaps of TAZ-based polymers would be wider than those of BT-based polymers. Nevertheless, the nitrogen atom in TAZ provides an additional position for incorporating solubilizing alkyl chains without disturbing the planarity of the resulted polymers. TAZ was thus extensively employed as an acceptor unit to construct push–pull conjugated polymers.39,77–79 For example, Zhang et al. have reported a TAZ-derived push–pull conjugated polymer (P6) with medium band gap of 2.18 eV but a deep-positioned HOMO level of −5.54 eV. The solar cell based on a P6:PC61BM blend delivered a moderate PCE of 2.75% by using an alcohol soluble conjugated polymer modified Al as the electron collecting electrode.77 Replacing the sulfur atom in the BT unit with a carbon atom would lead to another new acceptor unit of 2H-benzimidazole, to which a dialkyl group can be introduced. Therefore, the resulting polymers of dialkyl-2H-benzimidazole would have better solubilities. Moreover, the stable quinoidal structure of benzimidazole would offer the resulting polymers good coplanarity. Song et al. first reported a series of push–pull NBG conjugated polymers using dimethyl-2H-benzimidazole as the acceptor units.80 As expected, all of the resulting polymers exhibited good solubilities at room temperature in organic solvents. Moreover, the polymer (P7) of dimethyl-2H-benzimidazole exhibited a smaller Eg of 1.64 eV compared to its BT-based counterpart P3. However, the photovoltaic properties of P7 are not as impressive as those of P3, with a Voc of 0.65 V and a PCE of 3.12%.80

Another method to modify BT is replacing the benzene in the BT unit with more electron-deficient pyridine to yield thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (PyT). Compared to BT, PyT is a stronger acceptor, because the pyridine in PyT is more electron-deficient than the benzene in BT. Therefore, PyT-based conjugated copolymers would have smaller band gaps and deeper-positioned HOMO levels relative to their BT-based counterparts. Blouin et al.54 first synthesized a PyT-based push–pull conjugated NBG polymer (P8) (see Scheme 3), which exhibited a smaller Eg and a decreased HOMO level compared to its BT-based counterpart P3. Moreover, Blouin et al. had predicted that P8 can perform substantially better than P3 in BHJ-PSCs by theoretical calculations. However, the actual device performance of P8 was poor, which may be caused by the low molecular weight of P8.54 Encouragingly, several state-of-the-art PyT-based push–pull NBG conjugated polymers were successfully developed soon after.87 If the benzene ring in BT was replaced by pyridazine, the new acceptor unit of [1,2,5]thiadiazole[3,4-d]pyridazine would be more electron-deficient compared to PyT. Consequently, the resulting push–pull conjugated polymers may have lower-positioned LUMO and HOMO levels. However, the tentative synthesis of an alternating polymer from carbazole diboronic ester and pyridazine-based dibromo monomer in Leclerc's lab by Suzuki coupling failed, which may be caused by the strong interaction between the palladium catalyst and the pyridazine core.81 Fortunately, replacing the dibromo monomer of [1,2,5]thiadiazole[3,4-d]pyridazine with [1,2,5]oxadiazole[3,4-d]pyridazine can yield a polymer (P9) (see Scheme 3) with Mn of 4.8 kg mol−1, which showed an optimal Eg of 1.57 eV, a deep-positioned HOMO level of −5.7 eV but poor photovoltaic performance.81 The Eg, energy levels and device performances of the polymers P3–P9 were summarized in Table 1.
 Scheme 3  The chemical structures of the push–pull NBG conjugated polymers P8 and P9. 
Quinoxaline is another promising acceptor unit for constructing linear NBG push–pull conjugated copolymers.88–98 The electron-withdrawing capability of quinoxaline is slightly weaker than that of BT, which would lead to slightly larger band gaps for the resulting polymers. Similar to BT, one of the important advantages of quinoxaline is that the deep-positioned HOMO levels can be maintained for the resulting polymers, which will be beneficial for not only the chemical stability of the polymer but also for gaining a high Voc in the final solar cell devices. For instance, polymer P10 (see Scheme 4), which is synthesized from fluorene and dithienylquinoxaline, exhibited a medium Eg of 1.95 eV but a deep-positioned HOMO level of −5.37 eV. Encouragingly, a high Voc of 0.99 V, a Jsc of 9.72 mA cm−2, and consequently an impressive PCE of 5.5% for the resulting devices fabricated from P10:PC71BM were obtained.88 P11 (see Scheme 4) is another medium-band-gap conjugated copolymer derived from quinoxaline, whose thin film absorption peak is located at 557 nm. When blended with PC71BM and modifying the Al electrode with an alcohol soluble polyfluorene, the PCE value of the BHJ-PSCs with P11 as the donor phase reached 6.07%, with a Voc of 0.81 V, a Jsc of 11.4 mA cm−2 and a FF of 65.8%.89 If a thiophene or thiophene-derived monomer is directly copolymerized with a quinoxaline-derived monomer, a much narrower Eg can be obtained for the resulting copolymer. For example, a blue polymer P12 (see Scheme 4) whose backbone is constituted from alternately connected thiophene and quinoxaline exhibited an absorption peak at 620 nm in a thin film. BHJ-PSCs using P12 as the donor phase and PC71BM as the acceptor phase exhibited a high PCE of 6.0%. Impressively, a high Voc of 0.89 V was delivered for this thiophene-derived polymer, indicating the advantages of quinoxaline.90 The energy levels, Eg and device performances of the quinoxaline-based polymers P10–P12 were listed in Table 2.

DPP is also a promising electron-withdrawing unit for push–pull NBG conjugated copolymers in BHJ-PSC applications.99–103 The coplanar conjugated bicyclic structure and strong electron-withdrawing ability of DPP provided excellent charge carrier transporting properties and a very small Eg for the resulting polymers (Scheme 5).104,105 Bijleveld et al.100 synthesized a pull–pull conjugated polymer (P13) of terthiophene and DPP, which exhibited a very small Eg of 1.30 eV and ambipolar transporting behavior in field effect transistors (FETs) with nearly balanced electron and hole mobilities in the 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 range. BHJ-PSCs fabricated from P13:PC71BM offered a PCE of 4.7%, along with a Voc of 0.65 V, a Jsc of 11.8 mA cm−2 and an FF of 60%.100 Replacing the copolymerizing thiophene monomer in P13 with benzene led to a new polymer P14, which exhibited a slightly larger Eg (1.53 vs. 1.30 eV) but a much deeper-positioned HOMO level (−5.35 vs. −5.17 eV) with respect to P13. The optimized electronic properties of P14 accordingly resulted in a high PCE value of 5.5%, an enhanced Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 10.3 mA cm−2 and an FF of 65% for the related solar cell devices.101 When using coplanar thieno[3,2-b]thiophene units instead of thiophene as spacers, the push–pull conjugated polymer (P15) of thiophene and DPP exhibited an impressive FET hole mobility of 1.95 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is the highest value for polymer-based FETs at this time. This respectable charge transporting property of P15 thereby contributed to a high PCE of 5.4% with a Voc of 0.58 V, an impressive Jsc of 15.0 mA cm−2 and an FF of 61% for the BHJ-PSCs comprising P15 and PC71BM.102 The energy levels, Eg, hole mobilities and photovoltaic performances of the DPP-based polymers P13–P15 were listed in Table 2.

TPD has attracted considerable attention as a promising acceptor unit for push–pull NBG conjugated copolymers in BHJ-PSC applications in recent years.40,41,106–112 Compared to BT and quinoxaline, one of the important benefits of TPD is that its nitrogen atom can be functionalized by a wide variety of substituents, providing good solubility and processability for the resulting materials. Moreover, the 3,4-positioned cyclic imide of thiophene in the TPD core is a very strong electron-withdrawing group, which will not only provide enough electron affinity for the TPD core to obtain a suitable Eg, but will also lead to deeper HOMO levels for the resulting polymers. Zou et al.106 first reported the utilization of TPD as an acceptor unit to construct a push–pull NBG conjugated copolymer P16 (see Scheme 6) for BHJ-PSC applications. As listed in Table 3, P16 exhibited an Eg of 1.80 eV and a deep-positioned HOMO level of −5.56 eV. These ideal electronic properties of P16 in turn resulted in impressive solar cell performances with a PCE of 5.5%, a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 9.81 mA cm−2 and an FF of 66%, when P16 was blended with PC71BM in a 1:2 ratio.106 Notably, several other research groups independently reported the same or similar polymers with different alkyl side chains to P16 soon after Leclerc's report.107–109 Among them, the identical polymer prepared in Fréchet's lab exhibited the best solar cell performances with a PCE of 6.8%, a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 11.5 mA cm−2 and an FF of 70%.107 The variations in the device performances for the same polymer in different labs may be caused by the different Mn of the polymers and the device processing methods utilized.

Thiazolothiazole (TTz), which has a rigid and coplanar fused bicycle of thiazole and ensures a highly extended π-electron system and strong π-stacking, has attracted considerable interest in the construction of high-performing push–pull conjugated polymers for application in BHJ-PSCs.72,113–118 For example, Zhang et al.116 have demonstrated that the push–pull alternating copolymer (P17) (see Scheme 6) of DTS and TTz displayed broad light absorption in the visible range of 400–685 nm, a HOMO level at −5.06 eV and a hole mobility of 3.56 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. BHJ-PSCs comprising P17 and PC71BM offered a high PCE value of 5.59% with a Voc of 0.77 V, a Jsc of 11.9 mA cm−2 and an FF of 61%.116 Similar polymers which have different solubilizing alkyl substituted thiophene spacers also delivered promising PCE values over 5% when using PC71BM as acceptor.115,118
S-tetrazine is one of the promising newly utilized heterocycles for the construction of push–pull conjugated NBG copolymers, which possesses a very high electron affinity for a narrow Eg and deep-positioned HOMO levels in the resulting polymers.119,120 The push–pull conjugated copolymer P18 comprising alternately arranged thiophene flanked tetrazine and CPDT exhibited a narrow Eg of 1.64 eV and a deep-lying HOMO level of −5.34 eV. Solar cells fabricated from P18 and PC71BM exhibited an impressive PCE of 5.4% with a Voc of 0.75 V, a Jsc of 12.2 mA cm−2 and an FF of 59%, as summarized in Table 3.119 Naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NT), which can be considered to be fused from two BT rings, is another promising acceptor unit for push–pull conjugated NBG copolymers. Compared to BT, NT possesses a more planar structure and increased electron-withdrawing ability, which are favorable for not only efficient intermolecular packing and for charge carrier transporting, but also for decreasing the Eg of the resulting polymer. Wang et al.121 first utilized NT as a building block to construct a newly efficient photovoltaic copolymer (P19) based on BDT and NT. Compared to its BT-based counterpart, P19 showed red-shifted absorbance, noticeably enhanced hole mobility, while maintaining suitable energy levels for a reasonable Voc. Impressively, BHJ-PSCs compromising P19 and PC71BM delivered a high PCE of 6.0%, which is much higher than that of the BT-based analogue (PCE of 2.11%) under the same conditions.121 Naphtho[2,3-c]thiophene-4,9-dione (NTDO), which possesses a coplanar conjugated structure and strong electron-withdrawing ability, is another newly developed acceptor unit for push–pull NBG conjugated polymers. P20, composed of NTDO and DTS, exhibited a small Eg of 1.65 eV and a low-lying HOMO level of −5.42 eV. A high Voc of 0.88 eV was thus obtained, benefiting from the deep-positioned HOMO level of P20, which finally contributed to the remarkable PCE value of 5.21% for the BHJ-PSCs fabricated from the P20:PC71BM blend.122 Isoindigo, which possesses large scale availability from natural sources and a strong electron affinity due to its two lactam rings, also fell into the scope of chemists for constructing highly efficient push–pull conjugated NBG copolymers for BHJ-PSC applications.123–127 Lei and Mei et al. have demonstrated that isoindigo-based conjugated copolymers exhibited excellent FET mobilities due to the coplanar structure of isoindigo.128,129 Wang et al.127 developed an NBG alternating copolymer of terthiophene and isoindigo P21, which has an ideal Eg of 1.5 eV and a very high Mn of 73.0 kg mol−1. BHJ-PSCs fabricated from a P21:PC71BM blend delivered a respectable PCE value of 6.3% along with a Voc of 0.70 V, a Jsc of 13.1 mA cm−2 and an FF of 69%.127 The energy levels, Eg and photovoltaic performances of P16–P21 were summarized in Table 3.
2.2 The influence of donor units on push–pull conjugated polymers
Besides the acceptor units, as importantly, the donor units also play a key role in the intrinsic optoelectronic properties and final photovoltaic properties of the resulting push–pull NBG conjugated polymers; the chemical structures are shown in Scheme 7 with related data summarized in Table 4 for P22–P34. For example, P22 is a push–pull conjugated polymer of alternating fluorene and DTBT, which possessed an Eg of 1.9 eV. BHJ-PSCs based on P22:PC61BM delivered a PCE of 2.2% with a Jsc of 4.66 mA cm−2 and an FF of 46%.59 Replacing the bridging carbon atom in the 9-position of fluorene in P22 with a nitrogen atom would lead to the above discussed polymer P3.62 If the bridging carbon atom in the 9-position of fluorene in P22 was replaced by a silicon atom, another high-performing DTBT-based polymer P23 emerged. P23 exhibited an Eg of 1.82 eV and a deep-positioned HOMO level of −5.39 eV. Although the solar cell of P23 fabricated in Leclerc's group only delivered a PCE of 1.6%,61 a more encouragingly PCE value of 5.4% was independently reported soon after by Wang et al. for the same polymer but with a much higher Mn (79.0 kg mol−1).64 The enhanced performance of the silafluorene-based copolymer P23 synthesized in Cao's group compared to its fluorene counterpart was due to its improved hole mobility (1 × 10−3vs. 1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1).64 When the 9-position bridging carbon atoms in fluorene or the silicon atoms in silafluorene were replaced by a larger atom of germanium, the new push–pull conjugated NBG copolymer P24 exhibited an Eg of 1.79 eV, which is slightly lower than those of its analogues P3, P22 and P23, suggesting improved intermolecular interaction. Nevertheless, the BHJ-PSCs of P24:PC71BM only delivered a PCE of 2.8% and a relative small Voc of 0.79 V, indicating that there is no improvement in either the PCE or the Voc when using germanium as a bridging atom with respect to its analogues P3, P22 and P23.130 Clearly, the bridging atoms on the donor units play an important role in the final optoelectronic properties of this family of polymers. Similar phenomena were also observed in the push–pull NBG conjugated polymers (P25–P27) using bridged-dithiophene as donor units, where the bridging atoms in the dithiophene donor units have significant influence on the properties of the resulting polymers.63,65,66 Yang’s group have revealed that the increase in the radius of the bridging atom from a carbon to a silicon atom could improve the intermolecular packing and crystallinity and thereby lead to enhanced charge transporting ability and slightly extended absorption of the resulting polymers, because the long Si–C bonds in silicon-bridging polymers displaced the solubilizing side chains further away from the conjugated main chains.131 Notably, similar work was also independently conducted by Scharber et al.132 As discussed in the previous paragraph, TPD is a very promising acceptor unit for push–pull NBG conjugated polymers in BHJ-PSC applications. Similar to BT, the push–pull NBG conjugated polymers of TPD using different atom bridged-dithiophene as donor units exhibited quite different properties. For example, P28, which is coupled from TPD and CPDT, exhibited an ideal Eg of 1.59 eV and a HOMO level of −5.29 eV. When blended with PC71BM and adding diiodooctane during film processing, a PCE as high as 6.4% with a Voc of 0.75 V, an impressive Jsc of 14.1 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 60.7% were achieved for the resulting solar cell.112 When the carbon atom in P28 was replaced by a larger atom of silicon, the polymer P29 exhibited even better photovoltaic properties.41 P29 possessed an Eg of 1.73 eV, which is close to that of P28, and a FET hole mobility of 1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. When blended with P71BM and with the addition of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) during film processing, a very impressive PCE of 7.3% and striking results for all device parameters (Voc = 0.88 V, Jsc = 12.2 mA cm−2, and FF = 68%) were obtained. Noticeably, the solar cell exhibited as high a PCE as 6.1%, even with an active layer of 220 nm and a device area of 1.0 cm2.41 Along with the idea that increasing the radius of the bridging atom can enhance the interchain packing and crystallinity of the resulting polymer chains and thereby improve the charge transporting abilities and final photovoltaic properties of the resulting polymers, Reynolds’ group40 synthesized a new push–pull conjugated polymer P30, which contains alternately arranged TPD and the newly explored heterocycle of dithienogermole. Compared to its silicon-bridging analogue P29, P30 exhibited a slightly longer wavelength absorption and a slightly higher-positioned HOMO level. When utilized as the donor material in BHJ-PSCs with an inverted device structure, P30 delivered an impressive PCE of 7.3% along with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 12.6 mA cm−2 and an FF of 68%. On the contrary, the conversion device based on the silicon-bridging polymer P30 exhibited a poorer PCE of 6.6% under the same conditions.40 After meticulous optimization, the inverted BHJ-PSCs of P30:PC71BM as donor can even deliver an unprecedented high PCE of 8.5%.42 In addition to bridged-diphenyl and bridged-dithiophene, the ladder-type conjugated unit of bridged-thiophene-phenylene-thiophene is another family of promising donor units for push–pull NBG conjugated polymers. P32, which is alternately copolymerized from IDT and BT, exhibited an Eg of 1.75 eV and an optimal HOMO level of −5.35 eV. A high PCE value of 6.4% of P32:PC71BM solar cell was thus obtained, benefiting from the simultaneous realization of a high Voc of 0.85 V, a high FF of 67.2% and a Jsc of 11.2 mA cm−2.68 Inspired by the work that the replacement of the bridging carbon atoms with larger silicon atoms can improve the interchain packing and the charge transporting abilities of the resulting polymers, two independent research groups synthesized the same polymer P33.133,134 Although the Eg and energy levels of P33 are close to those of P32, the FET mobility of P33 is two orders of magnitude higher than that of P32 (2.2 × 10−3vs. 2.2 × 10−5 cm−2 V−1 s−1), indicating the enhanced intermolecular interaction and packing between the polymer chains in P33. Unfortunately, the photovoltaic performance of P33 is clearly inferior to P32.133,134 It is worth noting that the nitrogen atom is not a suitable bridging atom for dithiophene or ladder-type dithiophene donor units from the reported literature, although P3 is a promising donor polymer for BHJ-PSCs. With respect to their carbon atom, silicon atom or germanium atom bridged counterparts, the nitrogen atom bridged dithiophene or ladder-type dithiophene polymers (P27, P31 and P34) usually exhibited significantly red-shifted absorption but much higher HOMO levels, possibly being caused by the lone pair electron on the nitrogen atoms donating into the thiophene rings and yielding more electron-rich donor units and accessible oxidation of the conjugated backbones. Accordingly, the BHJ-PSCs using these nitrogen-bridged push–pull NBG conjugated polymers as donors usually delivered disappointing Voc values, as shown by the related data listed in Table 4.66,110,135

2.3 “Weak donor–strong acceptor” push–pull conjugated polymers
As discussed above, bridged-diphenyl-based polymers usually possessed deep-positioned HOMO levels but medium band gaps and thereby led to a high Voc but a relatively low Jsc, while the bridged-dithiophene based polymers usually had small band gaps but relatively high-positioned HOMO levels and hence offered a high Jsc but a relative small Voc in the related BHJ-PSCs. To overcome this dilemma, You’s group proposed the “weak donor–strong acceptor” concept for the design of ideal donor polymers to achieve small band gaps coupled with deep-lying HOMO energy levels.136,137 It is well known that the HOMO levels of push–pull conjugated copolymers are usually determined by the donor units, while the LUMO levels are a function of the electron affinities of the acceptors.54 Therefore, a “weak donor” is beneficial for maintaining a deep-lying HOMO level, while a “strong acceptor” should help to decrease the LUMO levels and band gaps of the resulting polymers via ICT. Judiciously fusing less electron-rich benzene with electron-rich aromatics (such as thiophene, furan and pyrrole) would form such weak donors (such as IDT and BDT), while the “strong acceptor” is usually supplied by strong electron-withdrawing conjugated aromatics, such as BT and PyT. Towards the development of ideal donor polymers under the “weak donor–strong acceptor” strategy for BHJ-PSC applications, several new weak donors, such as naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene and dithieno[3,2-f:2′,3′-h]quinoxaline were also developed in You's lab.136,137 Encouragingly, several high-performing push–pull NBG conjugated polymers (P35, P36 and P37) (see Scheme 8) were successfully developed based on this strategy. P35–P37 possessed an ideal HOMO energy level around −5.4 eV and ideal band gaps around 1.5 eV. Consequently, solar cells using PC61BM as acceptor and these three polymers as donors exhibited impressive PCEs of 5.57% for P36, and over 6% for P35 and P37, respectively.87 Moreover, P32 and P33, which are discussed above, can also be considered as “weak donor–strong acceptor” push–pull NBG conjugated polymers.68,133,134 Another state-of-the-art “weak donor–strong acceptor” push–pull NBG conjugated polymer is P38, which is copolymerized from a symmetrical coplanar unit of BDT and DTBT. BHJ-PSCs based on a P38:PC71BM blend showed a notably high Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 10.7 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 5.66%.69 The Eg, energy levels and photovoltaic performances of the four “weak donor–strong acceptor” polymers P35–P38 were summarized in Table 5.

3. Fine-tailoring of the structures of push–pull conjugated polymers
Although the nature of the conjugated backbone dominated the intrinsic electronic properties of the resulting polymers as discussed above, the fine tuning of the structures (such as incorporating functional groups onto the backbone, the selection of alkyl side chains, end capping and so forth) is also critical for obtaining high-performing donor polymers.
3.1 Manipulating the energy levels of push–pull conjugated polymers
Liang and Chen et al. have demonstrated that incorporating electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms onto the backbone of conjugated copolymers can effectively decrease the HOMO levels of the resulting polymers and accordingly lead to an enhanced Voc in solar cells.44,45,49 Besides, conjugated polymers containing fluorine would have a smaller surface energy, which provides the possibilities of getting optimal blend film morphology by selecting proper processing solvents or additives.45,138 Zhou et al.71 have proposed that the replacement of the remaining two hydrogen atoms in the 5,6-postions of BT with fluorine atoms can further exploit the potential of BT and lead to some promising donor polymers. As expected, P39 (see Scheme 9), which is a copolymer of BDT and fluorine-substituted BT, exhibited a close Eg but clearly decreased both HOMO and LUMO levels relative to its non-fluorinated analogue. Encouragingly, the overall PCE of the BHJ-PSC of P39 reached 7.2% with a noticeably high Voc of 0.91 V, a high Jsc of 12.9 mA cm−2 and an FF of 61%. On the contrary, the control device of the non-fluorinated analogue only delivered a PCE value of 5.0%, clearly suggesting the positive effect of the incorporation of fluorine atoms in creating highly efficient materials for BHJ-PSCs.71 Along this line, You's group39 further developed another highly efficient photovoltaic material P40 (see Scheme 9), which is an alternating copolymer based on BDT and fluorine-substituted TAZ. In contrast to their previous observations, P40 only exhibited a minimal variation in the optical and electrochemical properties from its non-fluorinated counterpart. However, fluorination has a profound positive effect on the hole mobility of the resulting polymer, which thereby led to an impressive PCE of 7.10% for the BHJ-PSCs using P40 as the donor phase. On the contrary, the BHJ-PSCs of the non-fluorinated counterpart only offered a PCE value of 4.36%. Notably, a PCE over 6% can still be maintained for P40:PC61BM solar cells even at a thickness of 1 μm of the active layer.39 The replacement of one of the two remaining hydrogen atoms in BT with a fluorine atom also has a similar effect on the resulting polymers. Peng et al. developed a new highly efficient photovoltaic material of P41 (see Scheme 9) from thiophene-substituted BDT and mono-fluorinated BT, which resulted in high PCE value of 6.21% with a high Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 12.05 mA cm−2 and an FF of 59.9% for the BHJ-PSCs of P41 and PC61BM.82 The energy levels, Eg and photovoltaic performances of the fluorine-modified polymers P39–P41 were summarized in Table 6.

3.2 Improving the coplanarity of push–pull conjugated polymers
Besides manipulating the absorption characteristics and energy levels, improving the charge carrier transportation of the materials by fine-tuning the chemical structure is also important to gain better performing materials for BHJ-PSC applications. In principle, improving the coplanarity of the molecules and thereby enhancing the intermolecular π–π stacking to form an efficient hopping channel for charge carriers is an efficient approach to improve the charge transporting properties of the resulting polymers and in turn improve the overall photovoltaic properties.139 Xiao and Zhang et al. proposed a method to improve the coplanarity of push–pull NBG conjugated copolymers by fusing the pendant freely rotating aromatic rings of the polymers.94,140,141 For example, the hole mobility of the push–pull NBG copolymer P42 (see Scheme 10) is only 4.21 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, due to the two pendant substituted thiophene rings on benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (BDP) retarding the efficient π–π interaction between the polymer chains. The BHJ-PSC based on P42 thus delivered a poor PCE of 0.6%. After converting the two freely rotating pendant thiophenes into an enlarged planar polycyclic aromatic unit, the polymer P43 (see Scheme 10) exhibited a substantially enhanced hole mobility of 1.3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, as listed in Table 7. An increased PCE of ∼2% was also obtained for the solar cell fabricated from P43.140,141 Zhang et al.94 have demonstrated that converting the freely rotating thiophenes on the acceptor units into enlarged planar polycyclic aromatic units has similar positive effects on the charge transporting properties of the resulting polymers. For example, P45 (see Scheme 10) with improved coplanarity exhibited a much higher space charge limited current (SCLC) mobility (5.68 × 10−4vs. 1.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and obviously red-shifted absorption compared to P44 (see Scheme 10). Unfortunately, P45 delivered poorer device performance relative to P44 due to its poor solubility.94 Soon after, Lee et al. demonstrated that the planarization of quinoxaline derivatives can enhance interchain interactions and thereby improve both the charge transporting abilities and the final photovoltaic performances of the resulting polymers.142 Zhang et al.97 also demonstrated that the enhanced coplanarity led to increased hole mobility and photovoltaic performance for quinoxaline-based push–pull NBG conjugated polymers (P46, P47) (see Scheme 10). Impressively, high PCEs (5∼6%) were achieved for these materials due to the simultaneously optimized band gaps, energy levels, charge transporting abilities and solubilities.97 In short, improving the coplanarity could not only improve the intermolecular packing and thereby enhance the hole mobility, but coul also extend the π-conjugation, thereby leading to red-shifted absorption of the resulting polymers. However, the reduced solubilities may be a serious issue. These results indicate that a synergistic optimization of the polymers’ structure is critical for obtaining high-performing materials for practical application in BHJ-PSCs.

3.3 The influence of the molecular weight of push–pull conjugated polymers on the photovoltaic properties
The molecular weight or the degree of polymerization play important roles on many aspects of polymers, including their processability, thermal transition temperatures, optical properties, charge transporting capabilities, self-organization abilities, etc., which in turn determined the overall device performances. Müller et al.143 synthesized a series of alternating copolymers (or oligomers) of fluorene and DTBT with different number-average molecular weights from 2 to 38 kg mol−1 to investigate the influence of molecular weight on various optical and physico-chemical properties of the resulting polymers. It was revealed that the photovoltaic characteristics (PCE, Jsc and FF) improved with increasing Mn of the polymer when the Mn is lower than 10 kg mol−1. Nevertheless, the photovoltaic characteristics become less sensitive to small changes in the degree of polymerization when the Mn is larger than 10 kg mol−1.143 Notably, the Bazan and Heeger groups144,145 had different insights into the molecular influence on the photovoltaic properties of the push–pull conjugated polymers when they used P48a (see Scheme 11) as prototype. They found that increasing the molecular weight of P48a from 9 kg mol−1 to 38 kg mol−1 improved both the photoresponsivity and the charge transporting properties significantly. The higher molecular weight polymer exhibited a substantially red-shifted absorption spectrum, and 700 times higher FET mobility. The significant improvement in the charge transporting ability of the higher molecular weight polymer was revealed to be due to the improved polymer chain orientation in solid state. Consequently, the photocurrent measured under steady state conditions is 20 times larger in the high molecular weight polymer.144,145

3.4 The effect of end-capping and impurities of push–pull conjugated polymers on photovoltaic properties
It is well known that small concentrations of structural defects in active materials can significantly influence the overall device performance.138,146 Generally, the push–pull NBG conjugated polymers synthesized by the Pd-catalyzed carbon–carbon coupling reaction possessed reactive end groups, which are potential structural defects. Therefore, the understanding of the influences of the reactive end groups on the electronic properties and the overall photovoltaic properties of the corresponding push–pull conjugated polymers is critical for the further design and preparation new materials. Park et al.147 have used the two NBG conjugated copolymers (P48b and P48c) (see Scheme 11) as obtained immediately after the polymerization and after treatment with chain-end capping thiophene reagents, respectively, to evaluate the effect of the reactive end groups on the performances of BHJ-PSCs. It was found that the end-capped polymer P48c showed improved performance by making the devices less sensitive to the active layer thickness. More importantly, end-capping has an important influence on increasing the thermal stability of the devices. These results clearly indicate that the end-capping of photovoltaic active polymers is indispensable, although there is negligible influence on the optical and morphological features of the BHJ blends.147
In addition, the impurities can undoubtedly influence the final photovoltaic properties of conjugated polymers.148–152 Generally, residual palladium is one of the main impurities in push–pull conjugated copolymers synthesized by palladium catalyzed Suzuki or Stille coupling reactions. Kettle et al.152 have carefully purified P25 via multiple step procedures and have systematically investigated the influence of impurities on the resulting photovoltaic performance of P25. It was revealed that the decrease of the residual palladium content in P25 can significantly enhance its FET hole mobility, and also lead to enhancements in all photovoltaic parameters (including Jsc, Voc and FF) and the overall PCEs in resulting solar cell devices.152
3.5 The effect of side chains of push–pull conjugated polymers on the photovoltaic properties
Although the electronic properties of conjugated polymers are primarily determined by the molecular structure of the polymer backbone, recent studies have indicated that the solubilizing alkyl side chains were by no means a negligible factor and also play an important role in many aspects (such as solubility and processability, band gap and energy level, charge transporting ability and self-organization capability, etc.) and also the final photovoltaic performances of the polymers.60,62,66,75,153 Generally, long and branched alkyl side chains were the first choice to provide sufficient solubility and to obtain high molecular weights for the resulting polymers.60,62,75,153 As discussed above, the relatively high molecular weight of the polymers is indispensible for the achievement of high device efficiencies. However, the long and branched alkyls may affect the properties of the polymers in many aspects, such as the intermolecular packing of the polymer chains, the interaction between the polymers and the fullerene acceptors and so on. Therefore, carefully selection of the alkyl side chains, including the shape, length and position on the conjugated backbone is critical for obtaining high performance materials.
You’s group154 studied the influence of alkyl side chains on the photovoltaic properties of the resulting polymers from a series of copolymers (P49) (see Scheme 12) which shared an identical conjugated backbone (naphtho[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene and DTBT) but possessed different alkyl side chains on the different positions of the flanking thiophene rings. Their results demonstrated that long and branched side chains would weaken the intermolecular interactions, resulting in an enhanced Voc. On the other hand, short and straight side chains would facilitate the intermolecular interactions, which is beneficial for the Jsc but detrimental to Voc. Moreover, it was observed that short and branched side chains (such as 2-ethylhexyl) can lead to a desirable balance between Voc and Jsc.154 In fact, the short branched 2-ethylhexyl side chain has already been used in many highly efficient NBG photovoltaic polymers.25,45,48,49,65,106 However, it should be mentioned that 2-ethylhexyl may not be the ideal chain for all the given conjugated backbones. For example, the Fréchet group have demonstrated that the straight octyl is better than 2-ethylhexyl on the TPD unit for facilitating the intermolecular π–π stacking for polymers with the backbone of BDT and TPD, leading to a better photovoltaic performance.107
 Scheme 12  The chemical structures of push–pull NBG conjugated copolymers P49–P55. 
Besides the length and shape, the positions of the alkyl side chains on the conjugated backbone is another important factor that should be carefully considered.83–85,153,155–160 Wang et al.153 have compared a series of NBG polymers (P50) (see Scheme 12) containing BT and four thiophene rings with the alkyl substituent at different positions on the flanking thiophene rings. Their results suggested that the polymers with the 3- (R1) or 3′-position (R2) alkyl on the thiophene rings exhibited superior photovoltaic properties than those of the polymer with the 4′-position alkyl (R3) in the thiophene rings. It was tentatively concluded that the 4′-position alkyl in the thiophene rings would induce a large steric hindrance effect, leading to a smaller molecular weight and blue-shifted absorption.153 More detailed work about the effect of positioning alkyl side chains was conducted by Zhou and coworkers.155 The prototype of Zhou's study is P51 (see Scheme 12), whose conjugated main chain is alternating BDP and DTBT. It was revealed that anchoring the alkyl chains on the 4-positions of the flanking thienyl groups in DTBT introduced a minimum steric hindrance, maintaining an almost identical band gap and energy levels of the fundamental unit (unmodified BDP-DTBT). On the other hand, attaching alkyl chains on the 5- and 6-positions of BT, or the 3-position of the flanking thienyl groups introduced substantial steric hindrance, leading to much broader optical band gaps and poorer photovoltaic properties.155 From both Wang and Zhou's work,153,155 one law that can be generalized is that the introduction of alkyl side chains on the six-membered rings or the five-membered rings with neighboring six-membered rings would generate large steric hindrance and lead to poorer photovoltaic performances, while the introduction of alkyl side chains on the five-membered rings with neighboring five-membered rings would minimize the negative effects. For example, when the alkyl chains were attaching at the 4-positions of the flanking thienyl groups in the copolymer (P52) (see Scheme 12) of BDT and DTBT, no substantial steric hindrance effect was observed.156 However, if alkoxyl instead of aliphatic chains were attached on the six-member rings, the situation changed.83–85 For example, Qin et al.83 have demonstrated that introducing two octyloxyl chains on the 5,6-position of the BT ring could not only improve the solubility of the polymer P53 (see Scheme 12), which is a copolymer of carbazole and DTBT, but can also maintain the close packing of the polymer chain in the solid state. X-Ray diffraction patterns of the powdery sample of P53 indicated that the polymer chain is of planar conformation in the solid state. An impressive PCE of 5.4% with a Voc of 0.81 V, a Jsc of 9.6 mA cm−2 and an FF of 69% were thus obtained for the PSCs fabricated from P53 and PC71BM.83 Soon after, many other efficient push–pull NBG conjugated polymers based on 5,6-position alkoxyl substituted BT or BO were successfully developed.84,85,161 Li et al.157 prepared two interesting polymers, P54a and P54b (see Scheme 12), which possessed an identical conjugated backbone of BDT and DPP and the alkyl side chains with the same total carbon number in each repeat unit. P54a, which carried branched long chains on the BDT units and straight octyl chains on the DPP units exhibited a much higher FET hole mobility than that of P54b, where the octyl chains were attached on the BDT units, whereas the branched long chains were located at the DPP units. However, the device efficiency of P54a is substantially inferior to that of P54b. One tentative explanation for this contradiction is that the bulky branched alkyl chains on the electron-deficient unit of DPP can enlarge the distance between the electron-deficient unit of DPP and PCBM, reducing the bimolecular charge recombination and thus leading to a higher photocurrent.157
Notably, although aliphatic chains were extensively used in photovoltaic materials, other types of side chains were scarcely studied. Yao et al.160 demonstrated that the incorporation of mesogenic pendants at the end of alkyl side chains of the push–pull NBG conjugated copolymers could enhance the orientation degree of the polymers in films. More interestingly, both the LUMO energy level and the band gap of P55 (see Scheme 12) were significantly decreased with respect to those of its parent polymer, which contained normal aliphatic side chains. Although the BHJ-PSCs of P55 offered a maximum PCE of just 1.1%, introducing a mesogenic side chain onto the conjugated backbone would be a promising method to develop highly oriented ordered supramolecular systems for the active layer in BHJ-PSCs.160
4. New strategies for push–pull conjugated photovoltaic materials
As discussed in the previous paragraphs, the optoelectronic properties, including the light-harvesting ability, energy levels and charge carrier transporting capability, etc., of the push–pull conjugated copolymers with a linear structure can be effectively modulated by selecting suitable building blocks to construct the conjugated backbone and fine-tailoring the structure to meet the requirements of highly efficient BHJ-PSCs. Besides the work on the building blocks and side chains, new molecular design strategies were also proposed by several research groups to develop newly efficient conjugated donor polymers for photovoltaic applications.
4.1 Metallated push–pull conjugated polymers
Wong’s group have innovatively developed a series of metallated conjugated copolymers (such as P56, see Scheme 13) with tunable band gaps and energy levels for BHJ-PSC applications.162–165 The incorporation of metal atoms into conjugated systems yields several advantages. Firstly, the metal atoms may offer additional redox-active and paramagnetic centers for charge transportation and may change the electronic properties of the resulting conjugated polymers. Secondly, the HOMO and LUMO levels can be fine-tuned through the interaction of the metal d-orbitals with the ligand orbitals. Thirdly, the efficient intersystem crossing in such metal-containing conjugated polymers may facilitate the formation of triplet excitons, which have longer lifetimes to increase the exciton diffusion lengths. For instance, the copolymer (P56) of platinum-acetylide and DTBT exhibited good light-harvesting ability and ideal energy levels with an Eg of 1.85 eV and a deep-positioned HOMO level of −5.37 eV. Encouragingly, the BHJ-PSCs fabricated from P56 and PC61BM delivered an impressively high Jsc of 15.43 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.82 V and an FF of 39%, yielding a high PCE value of 4.93%.162 Afterwards, Jen’s group166 synthesized a similar polymer (P57) using thieno[3,2-b]thiophene instead of thiophene as the flanking spacers and ethyl instead of butyl as the solubilizing side chains. Interestingly, P57 exhibited a high FET mobility of 1 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 despite its amorphous nature. Moreover, a moderate PCE value of 3.73% was achieved for the BHJ-PSCs of P57 and PC71BM.166 Soon after, Jenekhe was also involved in this field and investigated the structure–property relationships of a series of platinum-containing push–pull conjugated copolymers.167 Fréchet’s group168 synthesized two cyclometallated copolymers in which the platinum atoms were attached adjacent to the conjugated backbone, without the inhibition of exciton delocalization along the polymer main chain. Triplet exciton formation was detected indirectly for these platinum-containing polymers in both solution and in film. The polymer P58 exhibited a Eg of 1.65 eV. The BHJ-PSCs of P58:PC61BM delivered a PCE of 1.3%.168

4.2 Acceptor-pended push–pull conjugated polymers
Huang et al. have proposed another new molecular design strategy, i.e. the so called acceptor pended push–pull conjugated polymers, to construct NBG conjugated polymers for photovoltaic applications.169 In this type of conjugated polymer, the conjugated main chains were constructed from electron-rich units, while the electron-withdrawing acceptor groups were attached onto the end of the side chains and connected to the main chain through a π-bridge.169 Compared to the traditional linear push–pull conjugated copolymers, this design possesses several advantages. Firstly, the band gaps and light absorption characteristics of the resulting polymers are determined by the ICT interaction of the donor in the main chain with the pended acceptor. Therefore, one can effectively modulate the optical properties of the resulting polymers by changing the donor/acceptor groups or the π-bridge. Secondly, the HOMO levels of the resulting polymers can be preserved in a deep-position by using suitable donor moieties to construct the main chain, due to the HOMO levels of the polymers being determined by their main chains, while the LUMO levels were determined by the pendant acceptors. Thirdly, the two-dimensional-like structural features render this class of materials with good solubility and better isotropic charge transporting abilities compared to traditional linear push–pull conjugated copolymers. In addition, the post-functionalization approach renders the resulting polymer with similar degrees of polymerization and molecular weight distributions, providing ideal prototypes to investigate the structure–property relationships. Huang et al.169 first synthesized two fluorene-based NBG copolymers (P59a and P59b) (see Scheme 14) based on this acceptor-pended design. Along with the increase of the electron-withdrawing strength of the pendant acceptor groups from malononitrile to diethylthiobarbituric acid, the ICT absorption bands were significantly red-shifted, and the Eg effectively decreased from 1.87 eV for P59a to 1.76 eV for P59b, while the HOMO levels were maintained in a deep-position of approximately −5.30 eV. Interestingly, P59a and P59b exhibited high SCLC hole mobilities of 5.27 × 10−4 and 1.16 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which is even higher than that of P3HT in a similar device configuration despite the two-dimensional-like structural features and amorphous nature of these two polymers. These excellent intrinsic properties of P59a and P59b in turn translated into respectable device performances. The solar cells using the two polymers as donors and PC71BM as acceptor exhibited PCEs of 4.74% and 4.37% (Table 8), respectively. Notably, a high Voc around 1 V was achieved for both P59a and P59b, due to their deep-positioned HOMO levels, suggesting the advantages of the acceptor-pended design.169 Moreover, Duan et al. demonstrated that the incorporation of a stronger acceptor of 2-(1,2-dihydro-1-oxoinden-3-ylidene)malononitrile can further decrease the Eg of the resulting polymer (P59c, see Scheme 14) to 1.57 eV with the preservation of a deep-positioned HOMO level of −5.27 eV.170 Later on, a series of new polymers based on this acceptor-pended design were developed by replacing the fluorene moieties with silafluorene, carbazole and indenofluorene in order to combine the advantages of these building blocks to yield efficient photovoltaic materials. All of these polymers exhibited tunable band gaps and ideal HOMO levels, and PCEs as high as 4.47% were also achieved for the related solar cell devices.170–174 In addition, the post-functionalization of this acceptor-pended design offered a useful way to develop fully visible light harvesting polymers by simply attaching different kinds of acceptors onto the same polymer main chains. In contrast to the linear three-component push–pull conjugated polymers, the distribution of the introduced pendant acceptors has little influence on the conjugated main chains in this kind of polymers. Based on this strategy, Duan et al. sequentially introduced two different acceptor groups onto the same backbone, yielding polymer P60, which exhibited effective light-harvesting in the whole visible light region.170 Besides, several other research groups are also involved in this field. Various building blocks, new π-bridges and electron-withdrawing groups were utilized to construct new photovoltaic donor polymers and were developed based on this acceptor-pended molecular design strategy.175–182 For example, Fan et al. synthesized several new polymers (P61, see Scheme 14) using thiophene instead of triphenylamine as the donor unit.178 Hsu’s group demonstrated that the absorption of the resulting polymer (P62, see Scheme 14) can be extended into the near infrared region by attaching strong electron-withdrawing groups.179 Nevertheless, the device performances of this family of polymers are still not comparable with the state-of-the-art linear push–pull conjugated copolymers, suggesting that further optimization in both fine-tuning the chemical structures of the materials and device processing are required for their practical application in the future.

5. Summary and outlook
The field of BHJ-PSCs is fast-growing in recent years with a power conversion efficiency over 8% now achieved, giving the researchers confidence and a bright prospect to push forward the further development and widespread commercialization of PSCs in the future. Such progress in this field is the result of the efforts from various aspects, involving the development of newly efficient donor and acceptor materials, the usage of new device processing methods, the invention of optimized device structures, the success of interface engineering, and so forth. Nevertheless, more efficient photo-active materials and the innovations in device architecture are still urgently required to achieve more than 15% efficiency and the commercialization of PSCs.
As discussed above, the development of new high-performing electron-donating photo-active polymers for practical applications in BHJ-PSCs is a systematic engineering process and several criteria should be considered and followed at the same time. The polymers should possess: i) appropriate solubility and miscibility with electron-accepting materials to form the desired bi-continuous penetrating network in the active layers, ii) well-matched energies of the frontier levels between the polymers and the acceptors to guarantee sufficient driving force for efficient charge dissociation while maintaining a high open-circuit voltage (Voc), iii) broad absorption spectra coupled with a high extinction coefficient to harvest as much as solar photons, iv) high hole mobility to efficiently transport charge carriers to the electrode, and v) good photochemical stabilities and the capabilities of stabilizing the bi-continuous penetrating network morphology to achieve long device lifetimes. Although it is not easy to fulfil all of the criteria concurrently in the practical molecular design, some empirical regularity was provided in numerous published papers, as discussed in this mini-review, and can be used in the future design. As discussed in the previous paragraphs, both the selection of constructing subunits and the fine-tuning of the structures are critical to obtain highly efficient push–pull type donor polymers. Furthermore, the regioregularity, which is scarcely considered for alternating conjugated polymers, may also play a crucial role in the intrinsic optoelectronic and final photovoltaic properties of the resulting polymers. For example, the tentative work in Bazan's group has demonstrated that the regioregularity has a substantial effect on the charge transporting abilities of the resulting polymers, despite no BHJ-PSC applications being reported.183 On the other hand, the newly proposed molecular design concepts will also help in the development of new photovoltaic donor polymers. Besides, more and more high-performing materials would be developed and flourish to their full potential, contributing to the widespread application and commercialization of PSCs in the near future.
