    , Accepted 12th February 2022First published on 14th February 2022AbstractAn integrated battery system, which integrates solar power and a rechargeable battery in the same unit, is an effective solution for the shortage and inefficiency of power energy. We initially present an integrated photo-assisted rechargeable lithium–iodine (Li–I2) battery system using a hybrid I2/N719-dye/TiO2 composite as a dual-functional photoelectrode. In this integrated battery system, the photovoltage generated on the hybrid photoelectrode compensates for the charging voltage of the cell, which decreases the charging potential by ∼100 mV under a chronoamperometry test. To be exact, under illuminated conditions, the integrated Li–I2 battery extends the charge/discharge capacity from 171/166 mA h g−1 to 204/193 mA h g−1, with a higher energy efficiency of 93% (output electric energy/input electric energy) compared to that of an Li–I2 battery (that is ∼87%). Furthermore, the accelerated redox kinetics of lithium polyiodine conversion are also revealed by the enhanced electrochemical behavior and density functional theory calculation. We believe that such a design with an integrated photo-assisted rechargeable Li–I2 battery can hew out a new way to realize the application of efficient solar energy conversion and storage.
1. Introduction
Clean and sustainable solar energy is expected to play an indispensable role in the energy map of mankind. However, due to the serious discontinuity and instability of solar energy, it is difficult to match the power supply, which urges researchers to explore integrated storage systems.1–3 New energy systems, which integrate photovoltaic/energy storage into a single setup, are drawing more and more attention.4–8 For instance, an excellent solar charging efficiency of 15.2% as well as photoelectrical conversion and storage efficiency of 12.04% are obtained in an integrated storage system using a dual-function aluminum electrode.9–14 In integrated photo-rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, the capacity can be increased by more than 57% under light.15 A photo-charged zinc ion capacitor with a photoactive V2O5 nanofiber electrode achieved a capacity increase of 63% under light.16 A high-performance photovoltaic/energy storage integrated system showed huge potential in industrial and daily-life applications.17–21 However, research on integrated mechanisms and explorations of new systems need to be developed in a sophisticated way.
A rechargeable Li–I2 battery is a promising candidate for the energy storage module in an integrated photo-rechargeable battery due to the low cost and high abundance of elemental iodine in oceans (50–60 mg L−1 in the ocean).22–25 What is more, the energy level of I2 can match well with most light-absorbing materials in an integrated system.26–28 For example, Yu et al. proposed an aqueous Li–I2 solar flow battery,27 in which I− is photoelectrochemically oxidized to I3− during charging, harvesting solar energy and storing it as chemical energy. Byon et al. demonstrated photo-assisted aqueous lithium-iodine redox cells, by electro-deposition of α-Fe2O3 film on the fluoride–tin oxide (FTO) glasses of the photoelectrode.28 The as-prepared Li–I2 redox cells showed a good energy efficiency of ∼95% during the photo-assisted charging process. Nevertheless, these two kinds of liquid flow battery systems showed low utilization of iodine, poor cycling stability and low electron conductivity. There is an urgent need to explore new designs for high-performance integrated iodine photoelectrodes. The ideal integrated iodine photoelectrode: (i) should have a well-matched rational band gap gradient to realize a high separation efficiency of the electron–hole pair,29–31 to achieve effective charge transfer; (ii) the illumination should catalyze the formation of lithium polyiodide to reduce the charging overpotential and to improve cycling stability; (iii) should have high conductivity; and (iv) should have flexible and robust physical properties.21,32
Herein, we propose a photo-assisted rechargeable Li–I2 battery, in which the integrated iodine@activated carbon/N719-dye/titanium dioxide (I2@AC/N719-dye/TiO2) composites were applied as dual-functional photoelectrodes. The hybrid electrode could function as both the photoelectrode in photon acquisition and the cathode for an Li–I2 energy storage battery. The well-matched band gap gradient between N719 dye and I2 promotes photo-excited electron transfer and thus harvests solar energy by storing it in an Li+ storage system. Besides, the light-harvesting materials (mainly I2 and N719 dye) do not merely accelerate the electron transfer in the redox process of Li–I2 batteries, but also inhibit the dissolution of iodine in the electrolyte by accelerating the formation of lithium polyiodide. Compared with Li–I2 batteries, the integrated Li–I2 battery extends the charge/discharge capacity from 171/166 mA h g−1 to 204/193 mA h g−1, respectively, with energy efficiency (output electric energy/input electric energy) increasing by 6% over that of a traditional Li–I2 battery (93% vs. 87%). The advantages of this integrated photo-assisted rechargeable Li–I2 battery were verified by converting and storing solar energy into electric energy. Testing results indicate that the hybrid I2@AC/N719-dye/TiO2 composite is an ideal photoelectrode for a photo-assisted rechargeable Li–I2 battery.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Preparation of hybrid I2@AC/N719-dye/TiO2 photoelectrode
The I2@AC composites were synthesized by an in situ iodine deposition method. First, 0.1 g of matrix AC (Shanghai Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, China) and 0.3 g of iodine (Shanghai Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, 99.8% purity) were dispersed in 10 mL of 10% ethanol (Shanghai Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd, 99.7% purity) aqueous solution, and the iodine was evenly dispersed by ultrasonic treatment for 1 h. Then, 6 mL of 30 wt% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was dropped into the above solution, which was then stirred magnetically for 4 h. Finally, 1 mol L−1 dilute hydrochloric acid was dropped in until the pH value was about 2.0 and it was kept under stirring for another 4 h. Then the precipitates were centrifuged and washed with deionized water several times, and vacuum dried in a thermostat at 60 °C for 12 h to obtain the as-prepared I2@AC composites. To prepare the hybrid photoelectrode, TiO2 slurry (Greatcell Solar Co., Ltd, OPV-18NR-T) was scraped onto fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) glasses (Yiyang Xiangcheng South China Photoelectric Co., Ltd, 2.2 mm OPV-FTO22-7L) with an area of 2 × 2 cm2, which were sintered in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 3 °C min−1. The TiO2 slurry consisted of terpineol, ethyl cellulose, 20% TiO2 and lauric acid. The modified FTO was completely immersed in ethanol solution containing 0.1 mmol L−1 N719 (Yingkou Opivit New Energy Technology Co., Ltd, OPV-N719-D) dye for 24 h, and then dried in a drying oven to obtain an N719 dye-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode. Then, a slurry consisting of I2@AC composite, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MCNTs), and cellulose (CMC) with a weight ratio of 70:20:10, was coated on the N719 dye-sensitized TiO2 conductive glass, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h, with an active mass loading of 1.0–1.6 mg cm−2. Finally, the hybrid I2@AC/N719-dye/TiO2 photoelectrode was obtained.
2.2 Characterizations
The contents of iodine in the I2@AC composites were determined with a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA, NETZSCH STA, 449F3) with a temperature range of 30–600 °C under Ar atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The structural determination of the I2@AC composites was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance with Cu Kα radiation (1.5405 Å)). The morphology and microstructure of the composites were analyzed by SEM (HITACHI S-4800) and EDS analysis. The surface chemistry of the I2@AC composites was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Escalab 250Xi). Raman characterization (Thermo Fischer DXR) was performed on a Raman microscope.
2.3 Photoelectrochemical behavior testing
The photoelectrochemical performances of the photo-assisted rechargeable Li–I2 battery were investigated by using a button cell with an open window. In such a cell, a hybrid I2@AC/N719-dye/TiO2 photoelectrode was used as the working electrode, Celgard 2400 was used as the separator, a lithium disc as the reference electrode, and 1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) with 3 wt% LiNO3 additives in a mixture of 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) and tetra ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME) as the electrolyte. The light source was a 2000 lm LED white light (AK-T-188, Ailike). The charging/discharging tests were performed by using a Xinwei BTS4008 battery test system. CV curves and EIS were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (CHI760E, China). The UV-vis absorption spectra were measured using a TU-1910 instrument (PERSEE, China).
2.4 DFT calculations
The DFT calculations were implemented using the DMol3 method with the fine quality setting. We selected Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) as the function of geometrical optimization. The convergence tolerance energy was set below 1.0 × 10−5 Ha with max force and displacements of 0.002 Ha Å−1 and 0.005 Å, respectively. The SCF tolerance was 1.0 × 10−6 eV per atom. First, we constructed a system of 3 lithium atoms and 3 iodine atoms as the reactant, and moved 2 lithium atoms about 20 Å away, with the latter system as the product to simulate the conversion from 3LiI to LiI3 + 2Li. Second, we tried to simulate the catalytic effect of N719 on the delithiation of LiI by adding an Ru atom at the same position of the reactant as the product. After the models were established, the structural optimization and transition state search (TS Search) were carried out. Finally, the Gibbs free energy was calculated with the formula shown below:δG = Epro − Ereawhere Epro and Erea are the lowest energies after geometrical optimization. ETS represent the transient state energy.
3. Results and discussion
A schematic of the photo-assisted rechargeable Li–I2 battery is drawn in Fig. 1a. It consists of two main parts: lithium metal works as the anode, and I2@AC/N719-dye/TiO2 is used as the hybrid dual-function photocathode. Under illuminated conditions, the N719 dye molecule (Fig. S1,† (ESI)) on the surface of TiO2 is stimulated by external light to generate electron/hole pairs. Owing to the matched energy level of N719 dye and TiO2, the photo-generated electrons are transferred from the high energy level to the conduction band (CB) of low energy level TiO2 (steps 1 and 2). The photogenerated holes stay in the valence band (VB) of the N719 molecule and are used to oxidize I− to I3− (step 3). Meanwhile, the photogenerated electrons in the CB transfer to the lithium counterpart throughout the exterior circuit, resulting in the reduction of Li+ to Li (step 4), and finally accomplishing the entire charging process, as schematized in Fig. 1b. When discharged under illuminated conditions, the electrons are transferred from the anode to the cathode, and the photoelectrons generated by the N719 dye are transferred to the CB of TiO2 and accumulated in the cathode. Electrons and photoelectrons accumulated at the cathode together reduce I3− to I−, and a small number of the electrons recombine with the holes generated by N719, thereby increasing the capacity of the battery. Li is firstly oxidized to Li+ at the anode, and I3− is reduced to I− at the cathode, which is similar to conventional Li–I2 batteries. Generally, the redox potential of the I−/I3− pair is ∼3.55 V versus Li+/Li for a photo-assisted rechargeable Li–I2 battery. The photo-assisted charging potential is equivalent to the energy difference between the Li+/Li couple redox potential and the CB (vs. Li+/Li) in the dye N719.33 Since the CB position of the dye is less than the standard electrode potential of the Li+/Li couple, as indicated in Fig. 1c, it is therefore speculated that the charging voltage of the photo-assisted rechargeable Li–I2 battery is less than that of conventional Li–I2 batteries.

(d) The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy of the electrolyte after photo-assisted partial charging (top, 2.9 V and 3.1 V), and fully discharged (middle), and fully charged under illumination (bottom). 
To investigate the photo-assisted charging process, we adopted UV-vis absorption spectroscopy measurement to monitor the I3−/I− components. At different charging stages at 2.9 V and 3.1 V under illumination, the electrolyte after charging was investigated with the ex situ UV-vis spectrum, and the results are shown in Fig. 1d and S2† (ESI). The gradual increase in the characteristic peak of I3− indicates its generation through oxidizing I− by photogenerated holes under illuminated conditions. As shown in Fig. 1d, two spectra at ∼288 nm and ∼360 nm are characteristic of I3−, while another one at ∼310 nm belongs to the adsorption spectrum peak of I−.12,28 The change in the adsorption spectrum indicated that the change in charge/discharge species at the I2@AC composite material was synthesized by the in situ iodine chemical deposition method, as shown schematically in Fig. S3† (ESI). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image in Fig. 2a indicates that there are abundant pores on the surface of the AC, which are conducive to inhibiting the dissolution of iodine into organic electrolytes (Fig. S4, ESI†). The elemental mapping diagrams of the I2@AC composite in Fig. 2b–d reveal that the C, I and O elements are distributed evenly in the selected area, demonstrating their good distribution in the AC matrix. The content of iodine in I2@AC composites is ∼39.91%, which was determined by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis in Fig. 2e. The exact structural transformation of the hybrid photoelectrode was studied by ex situ XRD to better understand the photo-charge process. Fig. 2f shows the galvanostatic charge–discharge (GCD) curve at 100 mA h g−1 with a marked voltage stage for ex situ studies under the first cycle of illumination. No apparent XRD patterns were detected in the I2@AC composites, from which it was inferred that iodine was completely adsorbed and even dispersed in porous carbon as an amorphous state (Fig. S5, ESI†).15 As shown in Fig. 2g, when the integrated photoelectrode is charged to 2.8 V under illumination, the diffraction intensity of typical LiI (111) significantly decreases, reflecting the oxidation of LiI to LiI3 catalyzed by illumination in the presence of N719 dye. During the discharge process, the diffraction peak intensity of LiI (111) increases gradually, which is mainly due to the conversion of LiI3 to LiI. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the I2@AC composites exhibits the presence of elemental C, I and O spectra in the survey spectrum (Fig. S6, ESI†). The corresponding high-resolution spectrum of I3d in Fig. 2h shows that two specific peaks centered at 618.8 eV and 630.0 eV can be observed, which are the characteristic peaks of I 3d5/2 and I 3d3/2, respectively. It is worth noting that the entire I3d spectrum moves to a higher binding energy during charging, which means that the illumination promotes the conversion of I− to I3− (Fig. 2i and j). The reduced ID/IG values of I2@AC in the Raman spectrum (Fig. S7, ESI†) revealed its low defects, which should originate from the physical adsorption between I2 and AC (Fig. S8, ESI†). This distinctive structure would dominate the stability of the electrode and inhibit the shuttle effect of iodine in the cycling process. As indicated in Fig. S9a† (ESI), the high-resolution C 1s spectrum shows a main peak of 284.7 eV corresponding to CC, and two sub-peaks concentrated at 285.7 eV and 290.1 eV, corresponding to C–C and CO. Moreover, the high-resolution O 1s peak in Fig. S9c† (ESI) corresponds to the CO and C–O bonds. After illumination, the intensity of the C 1s peak increased, but the O 1s peak decreased significantly, as shown in Fig. S9b and d† (ESI), indicating the decrease in oxygen-containing functional groups. The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isothermal curve and pore-size distribution of AC and I2@AC are also shown in Fig. S10a and b† (ESI). AC has a large specific surface area of 1641 m2 g−1 and a microporous volume of 0.64 cm3 g−1, while the specific surface area of the I2@AC composites is rapidly reduced to 800 m2 g−1, and the corresponding pore volume decreases from 0.64 to 0.31 cm3 g−1. This shows that most of the pores in AC are filled with iodine.

The photoelectric response is a direct measurement for evaluating the photo-assisted charging behavior of a hybrid cathode. The light response curve of the integrated device changes periodically with alternation in the status between dark and illuminated. Fig. 3a indicates the periodic change in the open circuit voltage (OCV), which directly reflects the potential differences between the cathode and anode. Under illuminated conditions, the photo-assisted charging voltage dropped rapidly from 3.24 V to 3.18 V. The obvious voltage drop can be attributed to the injection of the photo-generated electrons excited by the dye molecules into the TiO2 interlayers and their accumulation on the FTO. Under dark conditions, the accumulated electrons were gradually consumed, accompanied by a recovery in voltage, and the photo-assisted charging voltage rapidly increased to 3.23 V. These observations indicate the rapid reaction of the redox couple I−/I3− with the photogenerated holes and electrons of the dye molecules. In Fig. 3b, we compare the photocurrent curves of the TiO2/N719 photoelectrode and the TiO2 photoelectrode in the absence of dye molecules under illuminated and dark conditions, and no significant photocurrent response was observed for the non-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrode, which indicated the crucial role of the N719 dye molecule in the entire photoelectric transfer process. Fig. 3c and d reveal the charge/discharge curves of the photo-assisted rechargeable Li–I2 battery under illuminated and dark conditions. When charging at a current density of 100 mA g−1 under illuminated conditions, the initial charging platform was about 2.85 V, which was almost ∼100 mV lower than the initial charging platform under dark conditions (Fig. S11a and b,† ESI). In addition, the initial charge/discharge capacities of the battery under illuminated conditions rose from 167/163 mA h g−1 to 184/178 mA h g−1, respectively, which should be contributed by the photo-excitation and the resulting accelerated kinetics.

The charge (c) and discharge (d) curves of the I2@AC/N719-dye/TiO2 photocathode (orange and gray lines) under illuminated and dark conditions were compared with those of the TiO2/I2 photocathode (green line and black line) at a current density of 100 mA h g−1. (e) UV-vis absorption spectrum of TiO2 films with and without dye sensitizing. (f) CV curves at 1.0 mV s−1 under illuminated and dark conditions. 
Furthermore, the charging voltage plateau of the I2@AC/TiO2 photocathode in the absence of the dye molecules under light is almost equal to that of the I2@AC/N719-dye/TiO2 photocathode in the dark state, and the discharge capacity has decayed, as shown in Fig. 3c and d. Noticeably, the decreased discharge capacity of TiO2/I2 in the absence of dye under illumination should originate from the weak light absorption of TiO2, which generates less electron–hole pairs under illumination during discharge and the input electrons compensate for the light-generated holes in the cathode. The UV-vis absorption spectra in Fig. 3e show that the TiO2 film sensitized by N719 dye exhibits evident light absorption between 390 nm and 780 nm. For comparison, the non-sensitized TiO2 film has an absorption peak in the ultraviolet region, but no characteristic peak of light absorption is observed in the visible light region. These results further validate that the generation and transfer of photo-generated electrons in the experiment are mainly caused by photo-excitation with the N719 dye molecule. The CV curve in Fig. 3f reveals the effect of illumination on the redox reaction process of photo-assisted rechargeable Li–I2 batteries. The oxidized potential of the photo-assisted rechargeable Li–I2 battery is significantly reduced under illuminated conditions, which corroborates that light could accelerate the oxidation of iodine ions in the battery. Besides, the increased shadow area under the illuminated conditions compared to the dark one (0.25 vs. 0.22), further demonstrated that the increased storage capacity originated from light harvesting.
Cyclability testing was carried out at 100 mA g−1 to verify the cycle stability of the I2@AC composite, and the selected GCD profiles are shown in Fig. S12† (ESI) under dark or illuminated conditions. Starting from the 11th cycle, the charge and discharge capacity had increased significantly with the introduction of light in Fig. S13† (ESI). The favorable performance was more remarkable under illuminated conditions, where the charge capacity increased from 171 mA h g−1 to 204 mA h g−1, and meanwhile the discharge capacity increased from 166 mA h g−1 to 193 mA h g−1 (Fig. 4a), remaining stable at 178 mA h g−1 after 10 cycles. The capacity retention ratio is 92.6%, and the Coulomb efficiency after cycling is above 97.0%. For comparison, the Coulomb efficiency is about 90% for an aqueous lithium–iodine solar flow battery.27 The enlarged charge profile in Fig. 4b shows that it takes 29 minutes to complete the entire charging platform under illuminated conditions, which is longer than that in the dark (24 minutes). This indicates that illumination promotes the formation of lithium polyiodide and reduces the overpotential of charging, thereby increasing the cycle capacity of Li–I2 batteries.

To clarify the merits of such an integrated battery, we compare the electrochemical performance of Li–I2 batteries with different electrodes reported by other groups in Fig. 4c.12,17,20,22–24,27,33 Overall, the photo-assisted rechargeable Li–I2 battery with a hybrid I2@AC/N719-dye/TiO2 photoelectrode demonstrates higher capacity due to the reduced charge platform and stable cycle performance under illuminated conditions. In addition, the charging platform voltage and energy efficiency of the photo-assisted rechargeable Li–I2 battery and a traditional Li–I2 battery are compared in Fig. 4d and shown in Table S1† (ESI). Compared with the conventional Li–I2 battery, the energy efficiency of the photo-assisted rechargeable Li–I2 battery increased by 6% (93% vs. 87%) under illuminated conditions. Similarly, the cycle stability of the photo-assisted rechargeable Li–I2 battery was also demonstrated by a GCD test in Fig. 4e and f. After cycling 20 times under illuminated conditions, the cell could still reduce the charging voltage by nearly 100 mV, which is conducive to a saving in input power of 3.38% calculated based on the charge-voltage drop. Additionally, the excellent rate ability of the common Li–I2 cell in Fig. S14† (ESI) shows that the cell exhibits a stable cycle life and a high capacity retention rate, which endows it with more prospects in practical applications, especially in a light-assisted rechargeable battery with such a hybrid I2@AC/N719-dye/TiO2 photoelectrode.
The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the integrated photo-assisted rechargeable Li–I2 battery under illuminated or dark conditions are also shown in Fig. S15† (ESI). The lower resistance values (577.9 Ω vs. 639.4 Ω) of the cell under illuminated conditions indicate that the electrons and holes generated by the photoexcitation of N719 dye molecules accelerate charge transport and speed up electron transfer.34 To further investigate the role of light on the photo-assisted rechargeable Li–I2 battery, we also conducted a constant voltage charge test by chronoamperometry in Fig. S16† (ESI) to investigate the current changes in the cell under dark or illuminated conditions. The increased current under illumination demonstrates the promoting effect of the N719 dye molecule on photon absorption and charge transfer.35 The prolonged discharge time in the following discharge in Fig. S17† (ESI) indicated the increased capacity from the previous photo-assisted charge. So the cell could still power up grouped color bulbs, elucidating its higher power output in Fig. S18† (ESI).
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also conducted to better understand the promoting effect of dye N719 on the conversion between LiI3 and LiI. In the absence of N719 dye, the energy (δG) required to convert LiI into LiI3 in Fig. 5a and b is about 0.24 eV, which is calculated based on the equation δG = Epro − Erea = (ELiI3+Li) − (E3LiI). For comparison, in the presence of N719 (herein we chose the radical ruthenium (Ru) atom as shorthand for N719 dye), the lower δG value of 0.15 eV indicated the enhanced reaction kinetics of LiI to LiI3, as shown in Fig. 5c and d. Besides, the energy barriers in the presence of N719 would be 37.5% (∼0.09 eV) lower than that without N719 in Fig. 5e and f. These results reveal that such a hybrid photoelectrode could not only reduce the energy required for the reaction but could also effectively accelerate the conversion rate of lithium polyiodide, preventing the unwanted shuttle effect.

(f) After the addition of an Ru atom, the energy change required from reactant 3LiI to product LiI3 + 2Li, ΔE (eV) = E (eV) + 23272.59 (eV). 
Although the fast photoelectric response, high energy-saving efficiency and lower interface kinetics were clearly elucidated for the photo-assisted rechargeable Li–I2 battery with such an I2@AC/N719-dye/TiO2 photoelectrode, admittedly the electrochemical performances including specific capacity and cycling stability of this integrated battery at the present stage of development are less than satisfactory. Future directions with optimization include (1) replacing the conductive glass by one with higher conductivity, thus reducing the conductive agents, and (2) identifying a highly-efficient dye sensitizer from the existing dye sensitive solar cell (DSSC) database. Further research is also ongoing in our laboratory.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated an efficient photo-assisted rechargeable Li–I2 battery, using a hybrid I2@AC/N719-dye/TiO2 photoelectrode, which performed with a well-matched band gap gradient, lower interface kinetics, and a catalytic effect for lithium polyiodide conversion. Upon illumination, the photo-assisted charge from the hybrid photoelectrode is beneficial for decreasing the charge voltage through the contribution of the photon-generated voltage with an electricity saving of 3.38% (calculated based on the charge-voltage drop), with the energy efficiency increasing by 6%. XPS results further validated the photoelectric behavior of the hybrid photoelectrode. Furthermore, the catalytic effect for lithium polyiodide conversion was also observed based on the photoelectrochemical behavior and DFT calculations. Consequently, the hybrid I2@AC/N719-dye/TiO2 photoelectrode showed a fast photoelectric response, energy-saving performance and lower interface kinetics for a photo-assisted rechargeable Li–I2 battery.
