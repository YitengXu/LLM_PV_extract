    , Accepted 25th May 2022First published on 26th May 2022AbstractTwo low-bandgap ADA small molecule acceptors A1 and A2 with asymmetric out-of-plane side chains were synthesized. Different from previous studies, the asymmetric side chains of A1 and A2 were installed at the two sp3 bridge-head carbons of the core unit, respectively. A1 and A2 show larger molecular dipole moments, stronger π–π interactions and higher electron mobilities than the symmetric counterpart S1, and exhibit higher miscibility with the donor L1-S. Higher power conversion efficiencies of 13.25% and 14.43% were achieved by L1-S:A1 and L1-S:A2 solar cells, respectively.
Introduction
In 2015, the report of the acceptor–donor–acceptor (ADA) small molecule acceptor ITIC (Fig. 1a) opened a new era for organic solar cells (OSCs).1 Compared with traditional fullerene acceptors, ADA acceptors show many advantages like strong visible to near-infrared (NIR) light-harvesting capability, easily adjustable chemical structures and energy levels, small energy loss and good morphological stability.2–13 Much higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been achieved by ADA-acceptor-based solar cells.14–18 In recent years, developing asymmetric ADA acceptors has attracted considerable research interests.19,20 Introducing asymmetry into ADA molecules can increase the dipole moment and dielectric constant, leading to reduced exciton binding energy and more efficient exciton dissociation.21–24 Moreover, asymmetric structures alter the optoelectronic and packing properties of the acceptors, showing a profound impact on their performance in solar cells.21,25–28 ADA acceptors consist of three key structural elements: the core unit, the two end units and the out-of-plane side chains. Thus, asymmetry can be introduced into these three parts. Most of the previous studies focused on the design of asymmetric core and end units.27,29–39 There are only a few reports about asymmetric side chain engineering. In 2017, Bo et al. first reported an ADA acceptor, IDT-OB (Fig. 1b), with asymmetric side chains.40 An aryl and an alkyl side chain were attached to the same sp3 bridge-head carbon of the indacenodithiophene (IDT) core unit. The asymmetric side chains render IDT-OB higher solubility and dense packing properties as compared to symmetric counterparts. IDT-OB delivered a PCE of 10.12% in solar cells. Later, Bo et al. synthesized a similar acceptor, IDTT-OB, by attaching asymmetric side chains to the indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) core unit.41 IDTT-OB cells afforded a higher PCE of 11.19%. In 2020, Huang et al. introduced an aryl and an alkoxy side chain to the same sp3 carbon of the IDT unit and synthesized the asymmetric acceptor IDTP-O–C, which gave a PCE of 8.61%.42 In this work, we report the development of two low-bandgap ADA acceptors A1 and A2 via asymmetric side chain engineering (Fig. 1c). Different from previous studies, asymmetric out-of-plane side chains were installed at the two sp3 carbons of the core unit, respectively. A1 and A2 show enhanced dipole moments, strong NIR-absorbing capability, good electron mobilities and good photovoltaic performance. When blending with the wide-bandgap copolymer donor L1-S,43 A1 and A2 delivered decent PCEs of 13.25% and 14.43%, respectively.

Results and discussion
The synthetic routes for A1 and A2 are shown in Scheme 1. Stille coupling of 2,5-dichlorothieno[3,2-b]thiophene-3,6-dicarboxylate and tributyl(6-undecylthieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)stannane afforded compound 1 in 84% yield. By treating compound 1 with 3.5 equivalents of the Grignard reagent PhMgBr, we could obtain the bis-addition product 2 in a relatively good yield of 43%. It was interesting to find that the bis-addition took place at the same ester group. A working hypothesis is shown in Scheme 1. The mono-addition of PhMgBr to 1 should produce the ketone-ester intermediate. Since ketone is more reactive than ester to the Grignard reagent, the next addition of PhMgBr to ketone is more favorable. Thanks to this selective bis-addition, we were able to introduce different Grignard reagents to the remaining ester group to create asymmetric side chains. Thus, treating compound 2 with (4-hexylphenyl)magnesium bromide or (3-hexylphenyl)magnesium bromide, followed by an acid-promoted cyclization, produced the fused-ring compound 3 or 4 in 70% or 81% yield, respectively. The Vilsmeier reaction with 3 or 4 as the starting material produced the bis-aldehyde compound 5 or 6 in 92% or 94% yield, respectively. Finally, Knoevenagel condensation of compound 5 or 6 with 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile gave A1 or A2 in 75% or 91% yield, respectively. For comparison, we also synthesized a symmetric analogue S1 (with four 4-hexylphenyl side chains) for A1 and A2 (Scheme S1). The synthetic details for all new compounds can be found in the ESI.† The compounds were characterized by NMR and mass spectroscopy. Although A1 and A2 have fewer alkyl carbons than S1, they both show good solubility in common organic solvents like chloroform and toluene. The solubility values for A1, A2 and S1 in chloroform were measured to be 149 mg mL−1, 113 mg mL−1 and 166 mg mL−1, respectively (see the ESI†).
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes for A1 and A2. 
We conducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations to obtain the structural and electronic information of the acceptors. All structures were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The optimized molecular geometries and frontier orbitals are shown in Fig. 2. As expected, the asymmetric acceptors A1 and A2 show larger dipole moments than the symmetric acceptor S1. The dipole moment values are 0.92 D, 0.66 D and 0.38 D for A1, A2 and S1, respectively. A1 and A2 show lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels than S1. The HOMO energy levels are −5.32 eV, −5.35 eV and −5.28 eV for A1, A2 and S1, respectively, and the LUMO energy levels are −3.46 eV, −3.50 eV and −3.44 eV for A1, A2 and S1, respectively. Nevertheless, the HOMO–LUMO gaps for A1, A2 and S1 are similar, which are 1.86 eV, 1.85 eV and 1.84 eV, respectively. The absorption spectra for A1, A2 and S1 are shown in Fig. 3b. In solution, A1 and A2 show a similar absorption band in the range of 600–860 nm, which is blue-shifted as compared to that of S1. The absorption peaks are 787 nm, 784 nm and 795 nm for A1, A2 and S1, respectively. In films, the absorption peak shows a red-shift and the absorption band shows broadening for all acceptors. Compared with the symmetric acceptor S1 which shows a red-shift of 38 nm, A1 and A2 show larger red-shifts of 41 nm and 56 nm, respectively, suggesting the stronger J-aggregation of A1 and A2 in the solid state.44 The optical bandgaps estimated from the absorption onsets of the films are 1.32 eV, 1.34 eV and 1.32 eV for A1, A2 and S1, respectively. The small bandgaps and the strong NIR-absorbing capability covering 600–950 nm make A1, A2 and S1 suitable acceptors to pair with the wide-bandgap donor L1-S (absorption band covering 400–640 nm)43 in solar cells. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles for pure A1, A2 and S1 films are shown in Fig. S24. The π–π stacking d-spacings derived from XRD are 3.78 Å, 3.77 Å and 3.90 Å for A1, A2 and S1, respectively (Table S2, ESI†). The shorter d-spacings for A1 and A2 than that for S1 indicate the stronger π–π interaction of A1 and A2 molecules in film. This could explain their larger red-shift of spectrum from solution to film. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were employed to estimate the energy levels of acceptors (Fig. S25). The LUMO levels decrease in the order of S1, A1 and A2, which agrees with the DFT calculations (Fig. 3c). The electron mobility (μe) of the acceptors was evaluated by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S26 and Table S3, ESI†).45–47 Compared with S1 which has a μe of 5.57 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, A1 and A2 show higher μe values of 6.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 8.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher electron mobility for A1 and A2 could stem from their stronger π–π interaction in film. The less out-of-plane insulating alkyl carbons of A1 and A2 than those of S1 might facilitate the molecular packing and enhance the electron-transporting capability.

Next, we fabricated bulk-heterojunction solar cells48 to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of A1, A2 and S1. The device structure is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/L1-S:acceptor/PDIN/Ag. J–V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for the best L1-S:A1, L1-S:A2 and L1-S:S1 solar cells are shown in Fig. 4, and the device parameters are summarized in Table 1. With a D/A ratio of 1:1, an active layer thickness of 98 nm and 0.7 vol% 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) additive, the L1-S:A1 cells gave the highest PCE of 13.25%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.814 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 24.49 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 66.5%. With a D/A ratio of 1:1, an active layer thickness of 143 nm and 0.5 vol% CN additive, the L1-S:A2 cells gave a PCE of 14.43%, with a Voc of 0.800 V, a Jsc of 25.09 mA cm−2 and a FF of 71.9%. With a D/A ratio of 1:1, an active layer thickness of 123 nm and 0.5 vol% CN additive, the L1-S:S1 cells gave a PCE of 12.82%, with a Voc of 0.828 V, a Jsc of 23.26 mA cm−2 and a FF of 66.5%. Although the asymmetric acceptors A1 and A2 gave lower Voc than S1 due to their lower LUMO levels, they offered higher Jsc in solar cells, thus delivering higher PCEs. As indicated by Fig. 4b, A1 and A2 cells show much enhanced EQE responses in the 730–950 nm region than S1 cells, suggesting the more efficient charge generation and collection in the NIR region for A1 and A2 cells. The exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) and charge collection probabilities (Pcoll) of the three solar cells were obtained by plotting photocurrent density (Jph) against efficient voltage (Veff) (Fig. 4c). Compared with S1 cells, A1 and A2 cells show higher Pdiss and Pcoll. The more efficient exciton dissociation of A1 and A2 cells could originate from the larger molecular dipole moments of A1 and A2, which could reduce the exciton binding energy. Bimolecular charge recombination was investigated by plotting Jsc against light intensity (Plight) (Fig. 4d).49–51 The α values for A1, A2 and S1 cells are 0.970, 0.971 and 0.952, respectively, suggesting less bimolecular recombination in A1 and A2 cells as compared to S1 cells. The charge carrier mobilities of the active layer were investigated by using the SCLC method (Fig. S27 and S28 and Table S13, ESI†). Among the three blend films, the L1-S:A2 film shows the highest hole mobility (μh) of 6.09 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, the highest μe of 5.50 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the most balanced hole/electron transport. This explains why L1-S:A2 cells gave the highest FF. The superior charge carrier transport in the active layer of A2 cells should account for their higher performance compared to A1 cells. We employed atomic force microscopy (AFM) to study the morphology of L1-S:A1, L1-S:A2 and L1-S:S1 blend films (Fig. 5). Compared with L1-S:S1 films, L1-S:A1 and L1-S:A2 films show lower surface roughness and finer nanofiber structures. The root-mean-square roughness (Rrms) values for L1-S:A1, L1-S:A2 and L1-S:S1 films are 1.20 nm, 0.98 nm and 1.47 nm, respectively. The diameter of the nanofibers in L1-S:A1 and L1-S:A2 films is ∼20 nm, while that for the L1-S:S1 film is ∼25 nm. The finer nanostructures suggest the higher miscibility between L1-S and asymmetric acceptors than that between L1-S and S1, thus leading to weaker phase separation. We measured the surface free energies (γ) of L1-S, A1, A2 and S1 by carrying out contact angle experiments (see the ESI†). The γ values for L1-S, A1, A2 and S1 are 25.2 mJ m−2, 26.6 mJ m−2, 27.7 mJ m−2 and 28.9 mJ m−2, respectively (Table S14, ESI†). The closer γ values between L1-S and the asymmetric acceptors indicate the lower Flory–Huggins interaction parameters of L1-S:A1 and L1-S:A2 than those of L1-S:S1,52–55 confirming the higher miscibility between L1-S and the asymmetric acceptors. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the higher donor/acceptor miscibility in L1-S:A1 and L1-S:A2 blend films leads to a lower degree of phase separation, thus leading to finer nanofiber structures and more donor/acceptor interfaces in the active layer. The more donor/acceptor interfaces in A1 and A2 cells should facilitate exciton dissociation, thus explaining their higher Jsc than those of S1 cells. We further investigated the phase separation in L1-S:A1, L1-S:A2 and L1-S:S1 blend films by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM images indicate larger and longer fibrillar aggregates in the L1-S:S1 film, thus confirming its stronger phase separation compared to L1-S:A1 and L1-S:A2 films (Fig. S29).

Conclusions
In summary, two low-bandgap ADA small molecule acceptors A1 and A2 with asymmetric out-of-plane side chains were developed. Different from previous studies, the asymmetric side chains of A1 and A2 were installed at the two sp3 bridge-head carbons of the core unit, respectively. A1 and A2 show larger molecular dipole moments, stronger π–π interactions and higher electron mobilities than the symmetric counterpart S1 and delivered higher PCEs in solar cells. A2 is among the best asymmetric ADA acceptors to date. The new asymmetric side chain engineering approach in this work would shed light on the development of highly efficient asymmetric ADA acceptors in the future.
