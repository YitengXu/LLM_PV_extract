    , Accepted 21st August 2017First published on 21st August 2017AbstractThe nucleation stage has an important influence on the lead halide perovskite film morphology, and therefore the solar cell performance. Here, we introduce a facile temperature-assisted rapid nucleation (TRN) method to improve the film crystallization process and the film morphology. By employing low temperature anti-solvents (diethyl ether, chlorobenzene and toluene), we stimulate homogeneous nuclei growth, resulting in a highly dense perovskite thin layer. The TRN method prepared (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 devices exhibit a power conversion efficiency up to 19.2% and maintain over 85% of the original efficiency after 40 days of storage at room temperature under a relative humidity of 10–40%.
Introduction
In a short span of a few years, tremendous development has been made in the perovskite solar cell (PSC) field due to the strong light absorption, high carrier mobility and long carrier-diffusion length of lead halide perovskite materials.1–4 Following the first report on a 3.8% efficient perovskite solar cell in 2009,5 the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has dramatically raised to over 22%.6 Fabricating high-quality perovskite layers, which are mainly characterized by high surface coverage, low surface roughness and well-crystallized grains, is believed to be crucial for achieving high PCE.2 Generally, nucleation and growth govern the film morphology.7,8 Previous reports have uncovered that a few nuclei on the surface generate a large crystal grain size with the disadvantage that pin-holes are left between the grains.9,10 Rapid nucleation and retarded growth are critical in obtaining pin-hole free perovskite films.11 Therefore, various strategies have been developed to induce the nucleation process, such as gas-assisted methods,12 solution printing,13 additive approaches,14 illumination and solvent quenching,15–17etc. Among these methods, anti-solvent dripping would accelerate solvent extraction from the solution, which leads to fast nucleation thereby promoting high surface coverage perovskite films.9 However, it remains a significant challenge to finely tune the nucleation speed during the film crystallization process.
The processing temperature has been suggested to play an important role in the nucleation and growth of perovskite films.10,18,19 Li and co-workers found that the MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3) crystallinity increases with the increase of MAI solution temperature during the two-step solution process.19 Choi and co-workers derived a theoretical model equation from the Gibbs free energy and pointed out that the MAPbI3 nuclei number decreases with the increase of two-step reaction temperature.18 A larger grain size with the increase of reaction temperature was also experimentally observed. Snaith and co-workers employed heated airflow during the one-step spin coating procedure and stimulated uniformly distributed nuclei growth as observed by microscope imaging. A pin-hole free perovskite layer was obtained and an average PCE of 17.6% was achieved for the resulting planar device.10
In this context, we developed a temperature-assisted rapid nucleation (TRN) technique for crystal engineering of perovskite layers. By systematically investigating the influence of anti-solvent temperature on the crystallization process of perovskite films, it can be found that the nuclei number increases with decreasing temperature of anti-solvents. We use cold anti-solvents for the first time during the one-step spin coating procedure, which enables swift nucleation through the whole surface of the substrate. Inducing rapid nucleation which could produce smooth dense perovskite films enabled the fabrication of PSCs with a PCE over 19% regardless of the hysteresis effect, while attaining a higher degree of reproducibility.
Results and discussion
The schematic diagram of the TRN method for preparing highly dense perovskite films is illustrated in Fig. 1a. First, the perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on a mesoporous TiO2 layer at 4000 rmp. The films were then quickly washed with diethyl ether (DE) at different temperatures before the surface turned turbid. For simplicity, the corresponding perovskite films washed with DE at different temperatures were named as D-30, D-20, D-10 and D-0, respectively. These numbers represent the temperatures of DE. Finally, the perovskite layers were obtained by heating at 105 °C for 10 min.

The X-ray patterns of the perovskite films were measured to reveal the influence of the DE temperature on their crystallinity. Fig. 1b shows the evolution of the X-ray patterns of perovskite layers with decreasing the DE temperature. All of the prepared films displayed the typical diffraction peaks of the MAPbI3 perovskite tetragonal phase, including two notable characteristic peaks at 14.2° and 28.4° which correspond to (110) and (220), respectively.20 Furthermore, with the DE temperature decreasing from 30 to 0 °C, the intensity of peaks was significantly enhanced, suggesting increased crystallinity.21 The high crystallinity of the MAPbI3 film remarkably affects its optical properties. The perovskite films from dripping 0 °C DE showed stronger absorption (Fig. 1c), which was attributed to the increased crystallinity and possibly reduced reflection.22Fig. 1d shows the PL spectra of glass/MAPbI3 (D-30, D-20, D-10 and D-0) films. All samples were prepared on bare glasses to avoid the effects of charge injection among the active layer and FTO. From Fig. 1d, it is clearly shown that the PL intensities increase with decreasing the DE temperature, implying that the high quality films have fewer surface defects and enhanced crystallinity.23 In addition, a fluorescence peak centered at about 775 nm was also observed, which was in good agreement with the literature.23

Fig. 2 shows the top-view SEM images of the perovskite films from dripping DE at different temperatures. As can be seen in Fig. 2e, perovskite films with large particle sizes are formed at 30 °C. Although absorber films with large particles are beneficial for charge transport, the cell performance indeed decreased due to the existence of open grain boundaries.22 The large gaps between particle boundaries might result in charge leakage between the electron and the hole transporting materials.24 With the DE temperature decreasing from 30 °C to 20 °C, the large gaps reduced and became pin holes between the grains (Fig. 2b), indicating an enhanced nucleation. When the temperature was decreased to 10 and 0 °C, we could observe a densely connected perovskite (Fig. 2c, d, g and h). The grains in the top area of the perovskite film were almost linked together, which will favor valid charge transport in the cell.

To understand the effect of DE temperature on the perovskite film crystallization process, we captured in situ optical micrographs during thermal annealing. Fig. 3a–r show the images of the perovskite films (D-30, D-20 and D-0) at different stages of crystallization. Here, we assigned the perovskite crystallites in the optical image to the dark colored region embedded within the blue precursor phase. The sample from dripping DE at 30 °C (D-30) shows a small number of nuclei on the surface, leading to poor coverage of the substrate (Fig. 3a–f).9,10 Nevertheless, when the temperature was decreased to 20 °C, the D-20 shows uniformly distributed nuclei with full coverage. These results confirmed that the DE temperature influenced the stage of nucleation, which determines the final morphology of perovskite layers. Fig. 3s shows the difference of nucleation stages of perovskite films from dripping warm and cold DE. The role of cold DE is to facilitate homogeneous nucleation and thereby result in full coverage of the substrate. In the case of warm DE (30 °C), cluster aggregation is increased due to the slow nucleation stage with different crystallization processes, leading to large gaps between perovskite grains. When the cold DE (0 °C) was applied to the perovskite film, just after spin coating (that is, t0), some distinctive rod-like brown interconnected crystals appeared within the blue background, as shown in Fig. 3m. However, we do not observe such brown domains in the film from dripping DE at 20 and 30 °C (Fig. 3a and g). These images clearly suggest that the low temperature DE (0 °C) would induce faster nucleation, leading to a dense perovskite film. As the annealing progresses, these rod-like brown colored crystals are gradually dissolved (that is, from t0 to t0 + 25 s). Meanwhile, small spherical brown colored crystals appeared over the entire substrate and became much larger (Fig. 3o–q). We ascribe this phenomenon to the Ostwald ripening process.22,25

(t) Schematic reaction process from the precursor to perovskite grains via cooling crystallization and Ostwald ripening processes. 
Based on the above investigations, the underlying mechanism of the formation process of perovskite grains in the TRN method is proposed. Fig. 3t shows that the PbI2, MAI and DMSO were first dissolved in DMF and combined into a precursor solution. A transparent and light yellow intermediate phase was obtained during the spin coating, while the anti-solvent (cold DE at 0 °C) accelerated the perovskite nucleation from the precursor solution. Then, the nuclei dissolved and aggregated into spherical crystals under annealing conditions. With increasing reaction time, much larger spherical perovskite crystals were formed owing to the Ostwald ripening process.25 Finally, perovskite layers with high crystallinity were obtained via re-crystallization. In a perovskite solar cell, the quality of perovskite layers can directly influence the photovoltaic performance. Therefore, we studied the photovoltaic performance of PSCs from dripping DE at different temperatures (Fig. S1†), and the corresponding detailed device parameters are given in Table S1.† From Fig. S1 and Table S1,† we can see that the as-obtained D-0 based PSCs exhibit higher short-circuit current density and open-circuit voltage than other PSCs (D-30, D-20 and D-10). The PCE of the PSC from dripping cold DE (0 °C) was promoted to 17.2%, in accordance with the densely connected perovskite as confirmed by SEM in Fig. 2.
To further investigate the universality of the TRN method, we also fabricated perovskite films using two other anti-solvents, chlorobenzene (CBZ) and toluene. In addition, mixed cation lead iodide perovskites are widely used as perovskite materials for preparing high-performance solar cells.26 Hence, the top-view SEM images of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite films from dripping CBZ at different temperatures were obtained. The corresponding perovskite films were named as C-40, C-20 and C-0, respectively, and the numbers represent the CBZ temperatures. As shown in Fig. 4, similar to DE, the higher temperature CBZ (Fig. 4d) leads to open grain boundaries and the cold CBZ (Fig. 4e and f) leads to densely connected perovskite grains. Compared with C-20, the surface topography of C-0 appears to be slightly more flat. A similar result is observed for perovskite films from dripping toluene at different temperatures (Fig. S2†). In addition, the statistical particle size for perovskite films based on DE and CBZ is shown in Fig. S3.† When the temperature of anti-solvents was decreased to 0 °C, the perovskite particle size based on D-0 (or C-0) became slightly smaller than others. Although these closely packed small perovskite grains inevitably increased the grain boundary number, the grain boundaries in the top area of the perovskite film may have a negligible or even beneficial impact on the performance of perovskite solar cells.27 These results demonstrated that the TRN method is a universal method for preparing high quality perovskite films.

As mentioned above, cold anti-solvents are beneficial to the formation of dense perovskite thin films. Thus, we studied the photovoltaic performance of PSCs prepared by tuning the CBZ temperature. Fig. 5a shows the typical photovoltaic characteristics of the PSCs, and the corresponding detailed device parameters are listed in Table 1. The PSC from dripping low temperature CBZ (0 °C) exhibited higher short-circuit current density (JSC) due to the enhanced absorption and charge transportation.28 The open-circuit voltage (VOC) showed a significant increase with the decrease of CBZ temperature, indicating reduced defect-induced recombination in the device.11 The photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cell from dripping cold CBZ (0 °C) was dramatically promoted to 19.2%, in accordance with the densely connected perovskite as confirmed by SEM in Fig. 4. The internal photo-current efficiency spectrum (IPCE) was measured to understand the changes in JSC. As shown in Fig. 5b, the IPCE of the cell (C-0) had a very broad plateau over 80% between 350 and 750 nm, further verifying its excellent photoelectric conversion characteristics. The integrated current density was calculated to be 20.3, 21.6, and 22.7 mA cm−2 for the corresponding solar cells, respectively. These results were quite consistent with the JSC obtained from the photovoltaic curves (Fig. 5a). In addition, as can be seen from Fig. 5c, the hysteresis effect of the J–V curves is negligible. The statistic PCE of the 30 solar cells along with the Gaussian fitting is also displayed in Fig. 5f. For the low temperature CBZ (0 °C) processed solar cells, it had an impressive average PCE of 18.4% over 30 devices, which demonstrated its outstanding reproducibility.

It is generally believed that the photovoltaic performance is influenced by the carrier lifetime.29 Thus, the transient absorption decay was measured to research charge carrier recombination behavior in perovskite layers. The results could be fitted to single exponential decays and detailed fit charge lifetimes are listed in Table 1. Clearly, the carrier lifetime fitted from C-0 (44.7 ns) shows the longest decay lifetime, indicating the higher crystal quality of the perovskite grains.30,31 Moreover, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were used to study the charge recombination in devices. Fig. 5e presents the characteristic Nyquist patterns obtained for all PSCs at an applied voltage of 0.9 V, and the corresponding fitted data are listed in Table S2.† According to Table S2,† with the decrease in the temperature of CBZ from 40 to 20 and 0 °C, the recombination resistance (Rrec) increased from 3.24 to 10.4 and 17.6 kΩ, indicating the decreased recombination of the perovskite layer and electron transporting layer (TiO2).32
One of the critical challenges in PSCs is their ambient air stability. Hence, the long-term stability of the prepared cells based on C-30, C-20 and C-0 was investigated (Fig. 6). Clearly, the PSC from dripping CBZ (0 °C) showed excellent stability compared to the others. It maintained over 85% of the original PCE after 40 d of storage in the dark at room temperature (10–25 °C) and under a humidity of 10–40%, which could be attributed to the dense morphology and fewer surface defects. This was further confirmed by the water contact angle measurements (insets in Fig. 6). The derived contact angles are 51.2°, 65.0°, and 69.8° for the C-30, C-20 and C-0 perovskite films, respectively. The increasing contact angle demonstrated a strong hydrophobic perovskite layer, providing a rationale for its enhanced stability in humid air.33

Conclusions
In summary, we developed a temperature-assisted rapid nucleation (TRN) method for preparing highly reproducible perovskite thin layers. It was found that the anti-solvent temperature affected the nucleation of perovskites, which determined the final morphology of perovskite layers. Thus, dense perovskite films for highly efficient perovskite conversion can be easily regulated by the TRN process. The champion (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 device based on the TRN method exhibited a PCE of 19.2% under AM 1.5 G solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The reproducible fabrication process by controlling the temperature of anti-solvents is expected to facilitate industrial scalable manufacturing of PSCs in future.
