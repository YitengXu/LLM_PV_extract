1. Introduction
Solar concentration technology is an effective way of reducing the cost of photovoltaic (PV) energy, allowing the use of small cells operating at higher efficiencies. The conventional approach to solar concentration utilizes mirrors or lenses to enable light concentration upon a cell, unfortunately these designs have a range of requirements that increase their cost such as the inability to concentrate diffuse light and the need for PV cell cooling and solar tracking machinery. Luminescent Solar Concentrators (LSCs) offer another approach to solar concentration that circumvents many of the problems of more widely applied designs. LSCs use luminescent dyes incorporated into a transparent matrix to achieve concentration by means of total internal reflection of emitted photons upon the edges of the device. Due to the nature of the design, diffuse light can be utilized by the lumiphore, while importantly heat is not transmitted to the PV cells avoiding the need for cooling. The design was initially suggested in the 70s and followed by a flurry of research,1–6 unfortunately, resulting in little success due to the limitations of available lumiphores.
The range of luminescent materials has greatly increased since this initial research and has resulted in a recent resurgence in LSC research with a huge range of lumiphores being tested including organic dyes,7–19 metal oxides,6,20–25 metal complexes,26–31 semiconducting polymers,32 dye-sensitised C6033 and even protein complexes.34 While the main application of this technology is concentration of solar energy upon PV cells, several other approaches have also come to light including indoor illumination,35,36 greenhouse applications37 and organic laser pumping.38 Several review articles have covered the subject of recent developments concerning LSCs39–41 but none have fully focused upon a family of very important and interesting lumiphores such as quantum dots (QDs). QDs show a number of promising properties that make them ideal for LSC use and therefore are the exclusive area of LSC work reviewed in this feature article.
2. Quantum dots
Semiconducting nanocrystals (referred to as quantum dots or QDs) demonstrate a range of unique properties and have a number of potential applications. When the sizes of bulk semiconducting crystals are reduced to the nanoscale, they essentially become “molecule-like” and give rise to unusual properties which result in the nanocrystals differing greatly from their bulk counterparts.42–44 Within the nano-size region, the crystallite can be smaller than the natural radius of the electron–hole (e−–h+ pair), which possesses a characteristic dimension known as the exciton Bohr radius. If the crystallite size is greater than this dimension, the exciton wavefunction can extend out beyond its natural limit; however, when the nanocrystal size is less than that of its characteristic Bohr radius (1.56 eV/790 nm for CdTe, 1.7 eV/730 nm for CdSe and 2.4 eV/516 nm for CdS),45–47 the carriers are independently confined. Between electron and hole states, inter-band transitions accompanied by optical absorption or emission may occur, giving rise to a discrete series of optical lines. Thus, the smaller the nanocrystal, the greater the confinement energy and the higher the energy of light it absorbs. There is a simple relationship between crystal size and emission colour; the smaller the size the shorter (higher energy) the emission wavelength, enabling the spectral properties to be tuned via manipulation of the crystallite size. Tuning of the properties can also be further achieved by controlling the shape in 1-D (quantum well),48 2-D (quantum wires)49,50 and 3-D (nanocrystals).25,51 Most importantly in nanocrystals, certain properties are no longer influenced by their band structure but by their size and shape.52,53 For example in the case of CdS, the band gap can be tuned between 4.5 eV (275 nm) and 2.5 eV (450 nm) as the size is varied from the macro- to the molecular scale. The energy above the band gap required to add excess charge also decreases by 0.5 eV54 and the melting temperature increases from 400 to 1600 °C.55 Depending on their size, nanocrystals can have between 10 and 50% of their total number of atoms residing on the particle surface.56–59 Consequently, these particles possess an extremely large surface to volume ratio; hence, surface coverage and interactions with the surrounding media play vital roles in determining the stability of these materials. II–VI cadmium chalcogens are one type of nanocrystal which have been widely investigated, in particular CdSe,60–63 CdS64–66 and CdTe based QDs.51,67–70 The range of unique fundamental characteristics of QD materials has enabled the development of new approaches to trace the evolution of electronic and optical properties of matter from the bulk material to the atomic cluster.44,71,72 The new possibilities to modulate and control photophysical properties arising due to quantum confinement effects above have opened the door to a range of new unique QD based materials and devices. Currently, quantum dots are considered potentially exploitable in many modern technologies including nanoelectronics, photonics, quantum computing, light harvesting, energy conversion (solar cells) and display panel technology.73–90 In addition, QDs are important candidates for medical applications in areas such as biolabeling, bio- and chemo-sensing, imaging and drug delivery.78,89,91–99
3. Operating principle of LSCs
The LSC is categorised as a low concentration system producing an effective concentration factor of between 5 and 10 upon the PV cell.100 The standard device design is a planar block shape, with illumination occurring through the top surface, into a transparent matrix, doped with a luminescent dye (Fig. 1). Either one or more PV cells are placed on the four sides of the LSC, while mirrors are placed upon the unused edges and a white diffuser on the underside,101 so as to reflect unabsorbed and reemitted light. Upon irradiation, the lumiphore absorbs the majority of the incident light and reemits it, while unabsorbed light is reflected back into the LSC by the bottom diffuser. The absorbed light is then reemitted by the lumiphore at a lower wavelength in all directions. A portion of this light, termed the escape cone, exits the LSC through the top surface and is dependent upon the refractive index of the matrix, while the majority is reflected back into the LSC due to total internal reflection. This trapped light then can only escape the LSC through the edges causing an overall concentration effect upon the PV cells.
 Fig. 1  Diagram of an LSC, depicting a number of processes. (1) Light enters from the top surface and is absorbed by the dye in the LSC. (2) Light is remitted and trapped inside the LSC due to total internal reflection. (3) Re-emitted light incident upon the top surface with an angle larger than the critical angle, escapes the LSC. (4) Light is reabsorbed by another lumiphore. (5) Light is absorbed by the matrix. (6) Light is concentrated upon the PV cell. (7) Light passes through the LSC without absorption and is scattered back into the device by the diffuser. 
The performance of an LSC is defined by the effective concentration factor (ECF) (also called the concentration factor, C) which is a product of the geometrical gain factor (G) and the optical conversion efficiency (ηopt). ECF = G × ηopt(1)
The geometrical gain factor is a ratio of the top surface area (At) relative to the edge surface area (Ae) of the LSC and therefore is dependent upon the dimensions of the LSC. G = At/Ae(2)while the optical conversion efficiency is in its simplest form a ratio of the power coming out of the edge of the LSC (Pout) relative to the power coming in (Pin) through the top surface. ηopt = Pout/Pin(3)
When characterising an LSC with PV cells attached, ηopt can be simply defined as (4)where ILSC is the short circuit current from a cell attached to the LSC and Isc is the short circuit current from a PV cell under direct illumination. The ηopt is determined by a number of different factors shown in eqn (5), most of which are dependent upon the lumiphore and the matrix. ηopt = (1 − R) × ηabs × ηPLQY × ηStokes × ηhost × ηTIR × ηself(5)
For eqn (5), R is the reflection of light incident upon the surface, ηabs is the absorption efficiency (a ratio of photons absorbed relative to incident photons), ηPLQY is the luminescent quantum yield (QY) of the lumiphore (a ratio of photons absorbed to photons emitted), ηStokes is the sum of energy lost due to the Stokes shift (a ratio of incident photons energy relative to emitted photons energy), ηhost determines the loss of light during the transport process due to matrix light absorption, ηTIR is the trapping efficiency of the LSC and ηself is the loss due to reabsorption of emitted light by the lumiphore.
Another metric also used to define the performance of an LSC is the power conversion efficiency (PCE), which compares the power supplied by a PV cell attached to an LSC relative to the power striking the LSC: (6)where Isc is the short circuit current, Voc is the open circuit voltage, FF is the fill factor, P is the irradiation intensity and A is the area of the LSC top surface.
The matrix plays two important roles in defining the efficiency of an LSC.102,103 Firstly the matrix must be transparent to the solar radiation and luminescent emission, avoiding matrix absorption losses (ηhost). Secondly, it must also effectively trap remitted light (ηTIR), which is dependent upon the critical angle (θc), the angle at which total internal reflection occurs (eqn (7)). This angle is defined by the matrix refractive index (ηr), with higher values making for a more efficient LSC. Therefore with an ηr = 1.7, ∼80% of emitted photons are trapped within the matrix after one emission event. (7)
To increase this further, a number of strategies have been explored to increase ηTIR, including photonic band stop filters fitted to the illumination side of the LSC,104–108 aligned lumiphores producing anisotropic luminescence109–113 and cylindrically shaped LSCs.114–116
Apart from this, LSC efficiency relies solely upon specific properties of the lumiphore, with the relationship described by these terms ηabs, ηPLQY, ηStokes and ηself. Therefore, to make an efficient QD LSC, the QDs used must fit to a number of strict criteria. In addition, to make a commercially viable LSC, the lumiphore must be stable, non-toxic and cost effective. All of these requirements in relation to QDs in LSCs are examined in the following section.
4. QD LSC requirements
4.1 Absorption spectrum (ηabs)
To create an efficient LSC, ηabs must be optimized, therefore the lumiphores used must show broad absorption and large absorption coefficients, allowing the majority of incident photons to be absorbed. A QD's absorption profile exhibits a characteristic first peak, which is indicative of the exciton binding energy in the material under quantum confinement (Fig. 2). The absorption spectrum after the first exciton displays rising absorption strength with decreasing wavelength, meaning a QD can absorb light over a broad range of wavelengths. In addition, QDs with a direct band gap show large absorption coefficients ranging from 1 × 105 to 1 × 106 M−1 cm−1, which are also size dependent.117–121

The onset wavelength of absorption in a semiconductor is determined by the band gap of the material. As discussed earlier, the band gap of QDs becomes size dependent due to quantum confinement, resulting in the increase of band gap energy as the size is reduced. This allows the absorption pattern to be tuned across the entire solar spectrum by using different semiconductors and QD sizes (CdS, 350–470 nm) (CdSe, 450–640 nm) (InP, 550–650 nm) and (PbS, 800–3000 nm).123 Additionally by adding specific impurities (e.g. Mn,124 Cu125) to produce a doping effect in QDs, the absorption profile can be even further controlled due to the alteration of band gap energy. A huge range of core–shell structured QDs126 can also be prepared allowing further manipulations of absorption spectrum. These are produced by coating a QD in a shell of another semiconductor with a different band gap energy, producing either a type I (CdSe/CdS,127 CdS/ZnS128 and ZnSe/ZnS129), a reverse type I (CdS/CdSe130 and ZnSe/CdSe131) or a type II band alignment (CdSe/CdTe132,133 and ZnSe/ZnTe134), which is dependent upon core and shell materials. All of these possibilities give a huge flexibility in QD design, allowing QD absorption to be tuned to the most efficient wavelength of absorption for LSC use.
4.2 Luminescent quantum yield (ηPLQY)
For an LSC the lumiphore must possess a near unity luminescencent QY (ηPLQY) for the device to function effectively. QDs can be synthesised with high, room temperature, quantum yields (CdSe (85%)135, CdTe (84%136)) forming defect free, highly crystalline nanocrystals. Some QDs have even been shown to display above unity QYs (PbS,137 PbSe,138,139 PbTe140 and InP141) due to MEG (Multiple Exciton Generation). In addition, QYs can be further increased using type I core–shell structures that allow isolation of the core QD, therefore removing surface dependent non-radiative relaxation routes. For large increases in QYs to occur using this approach, the lattice mismatch must be minimal between the core and shell, as seen with CdSe/CdS QDs (QY = 85%),142 otherwise defects will be induced in the core, reducing the QY.
The inclusion of certain metal nanoparticles (Ag, Au) in the vicinity of a lumiphore has also been found to increase their emission intensity due to plasmonic effects,143,144 an effect which has already been utilised in a number of LSCs.17,29,145,146 The largest enhancements are achieved by tuning the plasmonic resonance frequency of the metal nanoparticle (NP) to either the absorption or the emission wavelength of the lumiphore, increasing the excitation rate or the QY respectively.
4.3 Stokes shift and reabsorption (ηStokes + ηself)
The absorption and emission spectra of lumiphores should ideally not overlap for LSCs and are dependent upon the broadness of spectral peaks and the distance separating their maximums, termed the Stokes shift. By avoiding overlap, self-absorption (ηself) is minimized within the LSC, which otherwise would cause large efficiency drops, due to each reabsorption and emission event leading to a portion of energy loss due to the QY of the lumiphore (ηPLQY) and the trapping efficiency of the matrix (ηTIR). This needs to be balanced relative to ηStokes, the energy loss due to thermal relaxation of excitons prior to emission, which increases with increasing Stokes shift. QDs show a range of Stokes shifts, which are dependent upon the semiconductor material, the size of the QDs and the surface states of the QD, while the width of peaks strongly depends upon the size distribution. PbS has been shown to have a larger Stokes shift compared to CdSe QDs. It has also been shown that a PbS QD's Stokes shift increases as the QD size decreases.147 Other examples include increased Stokes shift from CdTe QDs when coated in a shell of CdSe, producing a type II core–shell QD.148 It has also been demonstrated that an artificially large Stokes shift can be created when coating a CdSe core in a CdS shell, examples of this include a type I heterostructured nanorod149–152 or a large multi-shell coated QD.153,154
4.4 Anisotropic luminescence
Using anisotropic luminescent dyes in an LSC, it is possible to reduce the overall escape cone by aligning the lumiphores perpendicular to the LSC top surface, increasing emission parallel to the LSC topside and therefore increasing ηTIR. A range of semiconductor nanocrystals can be produced in rod shapes termed quantum rods (QRs) including CdTe,155 CdSe,156 CdS157 and CdSe/CdS,150 many of which have been shown to demonstrate anisotropic luminescence, as a consequence of their anisotropic shape.158 Also very importantly, it has been demonstrated that unlike in organic dyes, in QRs the absorption profile is approximately isotropic at values above the band gap energy and is due to their unique electronic structure.159 Consequently the load of lumiphore does not need to be increased to compensate for the loss of absorption due to dye alignment, hence avoiding losses via increased self-absorption, which would have occurred.
4.5 Stability
A very important factor is the need for long-term stability of LSCs, displaying little significant loss in performance overtime; therefore, lumiphores used must show exceptional stability under illumination. QDs demonstrate excellent robustness towards photobleaching compared to other lumiphores,160 particularly core–shell QDs structures, which demonstrate the greatest stability.154,161 The process of QD degradation in LSCs is photoinduced oxidation of the QD surface and is caused by the presence of oxygen, which can be mitigated using a core–shell design, restricting degradation to the outer shell.
4.6 Toxicity
One of the largest perceived obstacles to QD use in commercial devices is related to their toxicity, since many QDs are composed of toxic elements including CdX (X = S, Se, Te), PbX (X = S, Se, Te), HgX (X = S, Se, Te) and XAs (X = Ga, In). Recent QD research has therefore focused upon realising solutions to tackle this issue, using a number of approaches. Firstly a range of colloidal QDs have been synthesised that are composed of non-toxic Cd- and Pb- free materials, including ZnX (X = S, Se), InX (X = P,162,163 Sb164), Bi2S3,165,166 CZTS (Cu–Zn–Sb–S),167 CIGS (Cu–In–Ga–S)168 and CuZnInS169 which can be used instead of toxic QDs. Secondly using core–shell design, it is possible to greatly reduce the toxicity of a QD, by coating a toxic core in a shell of non-toxic semiconductor, examples include CdSe/ZnSe,170 CdS/ZnS171 and CdSe/CdS/ZnS.172 Thirdly it is possible to coat a toxic QD with a non-toxic polymer coating reducing the overall toxicity, an example of this is gelatine coated CdTe.173
4.7 Matrix and solubility
A number of different matrixes have been tested for incorporation of luminescent dyes including sol–gels,174,175 porous glasses,176 zeolites,177–179 ormosils180 and polymer–nanoparticle composites.181,182 However, the most commonly used matrix for LSCs still remains the polymer based matrix, due to its ease of use and low cost. To fabricate a polymer LSC, the lumiphore is added to a monomer solution, which is then polymerised. The resulting polymer matrix should show a well-dispersed lumiphore incorporated within, avoiding aggregation of dye that can negatively affect QYs. A QD's solubility and matrix compatibility are strongly dependent upon the surface groups attached, and therefore can be controlled by functionalisation of QDs. Possible surface ligands include alkyl thiols, phosphines, phosphine oxides, phosphates, amides, amines, carboxylic acid and nitrogen containing aromatics and so can provide solubility in a range of aqueous and organic media. Therefore, it is possible to disperse QDs in most monomer solutions by simply synthesising QDs in the presence of a soluble stabiliser or performing a ligand exchange prior to polymerization.183
While a number of different polymers have been tested,184–186 poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) remains the standard polymer used as an LSC matrix due to its excellent transparency, high refractive index (∼1.5) and exceptional processability. Unfortunately, high QY QDs usually are synthesised using non-polar hydrophobic ligands and therefore do not readily dissolve in the methylmethacrylate (MMA) monomer due to its polar nature. As a result these mixtures form opaque films due to QD aggregation, in which luminesce is partially or totally quenched.187 In order to disperse these QDs in the monomer it is preferable to use the lauryl methacrylate (LMA) monomer that is more hydrophobic and allows the creation of clear transparent sheets.188,189 To create a stronger polymer, LMA needs to be copolymerised with EDGM (ethylene glycol dimethacrylate), which stimulates crosslinking in the polymer, in the ratio of 80% LMA and 20% EDGM,190 creating poly(lauryl methacrylate-co-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate) (P(LMA-co-EGDM)).
QDs can also be sensitive to radical attack produced during the polymerisation process, which can cause luminescence quenching.191,192 Therefore, this must also be considered when choosing LSC fabrication conditions.
4.8 Costs
An LSC must be formed from cheap and readily available materials to be a competitive option in the PV market; therefore, the lumiphore must not be excessively expensive. The raw materials cost concerning QD synthesis is reduced when using green chemistry approaches,193,194 while the colloidal synthetic approach is well suited to QD mass production,195,196 therefore it is potentially possible to produce QDs cost effectively for LSC applications.
5. QD LSC designs and models
In this section, we consider and discuss various techniques and approaches for theoretical modelling, design and fabrication of QD-based LSCs.
5.1 QD LSC theoretical models
The first QD LSC was proposed and modelled by the Barnham group beginning in 2000.197–200 Initially, they have offered a thermodynamic model using CdSe/ZnS197,198 and later CdSe/CdS199,200 QDs and predicted that the Stokes shift could be increased by changing the spread of sizes of QDs and so could be controlled by the growth conditions used to synthesise the QDs. From this, they determined that if QDs were adequately dispersed in a transparent medium and the QDs high QY persisted in the matrix, it would be possible to achieve an ECF of ∼20%. This model's predictive capability was then verified using planar slabs of acrylic doped with CdSe/CdS QDs or organic dyes.
Another theoretical model used to analyse the effectiveness of QD LSCs was published by Sahin et al.201 in which they looked at the effectiveness of CdSe/CdTe type II core–shell QDs in an LSC using Monte Carlo simulations. This model was used to predict that using a planar geometry of 6 cm × 2 cm × 0.4 cm doped with CdSe/CdTe with a QY of 95% and a matrix with a refractive index of 1.7, a maximum ηopt = 23.67% could be achieved using a QD concentration of 4.3 × 106 mol l−1. The paper then pointed out that the highest achievable ECF would be of ∼4 and would be created using a G = 26 and a resulting ηopt of 13% using a 10.4 × 2 × 0.4 cm LSC. In addition, this work indicates that only a single PV cell is needed to use the device efficiently, covering one of the 2 cm LSC edges. The subject of anisotropic luminescence was also modelled in this paper using nanorods of CdSe/CdTe that were aligned perpendicular to the LSC's bottom surface (Fig. 3). The result of this was a large increase in LSC efficiency reaching an ECF of 7.6, using an LSC measuring 10 × 2 × 0.4 cm with a G of 25 and a ηopt of 27.9%. This result means that a 70% increase in LSC efficiency can be achieved with the use of aligned CdSe/CdTe QRs relative to CdSe/CdTe QDs. Experimentally, the alignment of quantum rods in solution and corresponding matrix can be achieved by various approaches such as applying an alternating electric field,159 thermal annealing,175 solvent effects,185,202 controlled drying,203 and other techniques.122,204

Another important study used a ray-tracing model to determine the effects of LSC shape upon overall efficiency, reporting that no substantial gain in efficiency is found among three different shapes of QD LSCs, a hexagonal, a square and a right-angled triangle.189 This work also used a thermodynamic model to calculate the efficiency of CdSe/ZnS QD LSCs with emission matched to the absorption of a GaInP solar cell, determining that 24% of the AM1.5G incident light is absorbed by the LSC, which is reduced to a total ηopt = 5.225% using a device of G = 80, producing an ECF of 4.18. This low efficiency was determined due to the emitted light escaping from the top surface. To minimise this loss the effect of adding an ideal band stop filter to the LSC top surface was considered. This ideal filter was modelled with a 0.01% reflectivity to all wavelengths, excluding the emission wavelength of the CdSe/ZnS (565–685 nm) at which it had a reflectivity of 99.9%. As a result of this the absorption dropped to 21% of solar irradiation due to increased reflectivity, but the overall LSC efficiency hugely improved due to the limitation of loss of light through the top surface by the band-stop, producing an LSC with an ECF = 12.98 and ηopt = 16.2%. This therefore indicates the huge gains in efficiency if such band stops could be applied to a QD LSC.
Modelling was also used to determine the effectiveness of using NIR emitting QDs in an LSC.205 CdSe/ZnS green and orange emitting QDs were compared to NIR emitting CdSe/Zn0.5Cd0.5S/ZnS QDs, which produced a ηopt of 5.0%, 9.3% and 13.2% respectively under idealised conditions. This indicates a much higher performance from the NIR QDs, which is due to minimal reabsorption losses due to negligible absorption–emission overlap in NIR QDs, and their increased absorption range. Also importantly, it was shown that these NIR QDs show a weaker dependence upon QY for device performance relative to the orange and green CdSe/ZnS QDs.
5.2 QD LSC matrix and fabrication
An interesting QD LSC feasibility study was performed by Gallagher206 using a range of commercially available resins and CdSe/ZnS QDs. The QD's emission wavelength ranged from 488 nm to 560 nm with the most stable and highest intensity of luminescence being produced by a QD sample showing an emission peak at 488 nm. This QD sample was then incorporated into the range of resins at a concentration of 0.02% followed by characterisation using UV-Vis and PL which showed both blue and red shifting of peaks. Also disappointingly, all the samples showed an overall drop in luminescence, with epoxy resins giving the best result of only a 22.5% drop in luminescence, this is in contrast to alumilite, a urethane resin, which showed the poorest performance, producing a drop of 96% in luminescence. In addition, results of the methylmethacrylate (MMA) based resin, Plexit 55, showed a drop of 34.4% in efficiency.
Poly(LMA-co-EGDM) was studied in conjunction with CdSe/CdS NRs (Fig. 4), producing a clear, well-dispersed polymer QD composite, with QD QYs of up to 63% in polymer.207 This study also clearly demonstrates reduction in QY as the concentration of NRs increased from 0.008% to 0.32%, changing the QY from 63% to 32%. The effect of QD concentration upon matrix refractive index has also been studied using CdSe QDs in PMMA, demonstrating an 11% increase in refractive index when using high concentrations (fill factor of 0.15).208

In another work, plasmonic effects due to Au NPs have been utilised to increase the net excitation rate of CdSe/ZnS QDs in an epoxy resin.146 Enhancement reached a maximum at 2 ppm concentration of NPs, producing a 53% increase in emission intensity, with higher concentrations showing a net decrease in emission intensity which was attributed to energy transfer from QDs to local Au NPs.
A unique approach to QD LSC fabrication was demonstrated by Schüler,209 using a sol–gel dip technique to produce CdS QD coating on a SiO2 film. The resulting films showed broad band luminescence and a characterless absorption profile indicative of a broad size distribution. The emission also showed a two peak character which has been assigned to band edge luminescence and surface trap luminescence. It was also demonstrated that the overall onset of absorption and emission could be shifted depending on the annealing temperature, shifting from a green to yellow and then to orange emission colour at temperatures of 250 °C, 350 °C and 450 °C respectively (Fig. 5). Also importantly, an increased Stokes shift was found to occur for CdS produced at 250 °C, reducing absorption–emission overlap. Another QD LSC sol–gel LSC was fabricated by the Reda,210 producing a nanocomposite of CdS QDs in a SiO2 matrix using a spin coating approach on quartz glass. These QDs were characterised using XRD that showed an increase in intensity and a narrowing of CdS peaks as the annealing temperature rose from 100 °C to 400 °C, and was accompanied by a shift from 405 to 490 nm, of first exciton absorption. The CdS sizes were determined to range between 3.3 and 6.2 nm from UV-Vis and between 3.5 and 6.5 nm from XRD. Photoluminescence spectra showed an intense single peak, with CdS QDs produced at 100 °C giving the most intense and largest Stokes shifts. Both of these works illustrate an easy and straightforward method to LSC QD production, with both reporting CdS QDs produced at low temperatures as the most promising for LSC use.

One of the first studies to examine the overall efficiency of a QD LSC was undertaken by Gallagher, fabricating a number of QD LSCs using CdSe/CdS or CdSe/ZnS and comparing them to Lumogon F Red 300.211 All dyes were incorporated into a polyurethane resin and a single Si cell was attached to one edge of the device, while mirrors were on the three other faces, and a reflector was included on the underside. The highest performing QD LSC device using CdSe/CdS QDs with a G of 3.33 achieved a PCE of 2.1% under 800 W m−2 compared to a PCEt = 3.3% obtained using a Lumogen doped LSC. The shortfall in performance of the device was attributed to low QYs (10–60%) and a small Stokes shift which caused large re-absorption losses.
Another early study was also carried out comparing luminescent polymers (MDMO-PPV, MEH-DOO-PPV, and a red polyfluorene, Red F) to QDs (CdSe/ZnS) as LSC materials, examining them in solution incorporated into an LSC design.32 The polymers showed moderate to high QYs of between 45% and 67% and effective Stokes shifts of between 132 and 242 nm, while the CdSe/ZnS QD gave a QY of 50% and a Stokes shift of ∼30 nm. The resulting LSCs produced a G of 16 and a ηopt of 0.3% (single edge) and 1.6% (full perimeter) for CdSe/ZnS, compared to the highest performing polymer, Red F, giving a ηopt = 3.4% (single edge), and ηopt = 19.8% (full perimeter). The poor performance of CdSe/ZnS was attributed to a large overlap between emission and absorption, and poor QY. Further analysis using a ray tracing model showed that even if the QY of the QDs was increased to 95%, the device would still only show a ηopt = 13.6% (full perimeter), due to large self-absorption losses.
In another work, the Wittmershaus group tested two forms of commercially sourced CdSe/ZnS QDs in LSCs,212 termed samples 1 and 2, which showed a QY of 31% and 57% in toluene respectively. LSCs were then fabricated using sample 1 in an epoxy resin and sample 2 in solution, with the devices showing a PCE of 1.97% and 3.98% respectively. Testing was also performed upon the epoxy QD LSC in order to quantify the effects of photodegradation, when compared to an organic dye, Lumogen F Red 300. The QD LSC showed excellent photostability, displaying a slow degradation rate, which was five times slower than Lumogen red, even though at the illumination wavelength the QD showed an absorption coefficient double that of Lumogen red.
The effect of radical initiator concentration upon QD QY was studied in poly(LMA-co-EGDM).190 This determined that the optimal concentrations of 0.1 w/w% of UV-initiator Darocure® 4265 (Ciba) still produced a 25% reduction of initial QY for CdSe/CdS/Zn0.5Cd0.5S/ZnS core–multishell QDs (Fig. 6), while larger concentrations showed increased drops of up to 85% of initial QY. TEM was also utilised to determine the effectiveness of QD dispersion in poly(LMA-co-EGDM), with images showing little to no aggregation in the samples (Fig. 7), which was supported by the absence of long wavelength absorption background in UV-Vis absorption spectra. Stability testing was also performed upon an LSC manufactured using these QDs, in which an average of 96% of Isc was present after a simulated 3 month aging period. The highest efficiency achieved with these QD LSCs produced a PCE of 2.8% with 5.0 × 3.1 × 0.4 cm LSC, using a QD concentration of 0.52 μM l−1. A single multi-crystalline Si solar cell was used in conjunction with mirrors and a white diffuser under AM1.5 irradiation to obtain this result. This can be expressed as a ηopt of 15.32% and an ECF of 1.91, the highest value to date for a QD based LSC.

Other research was focused on comparing CdSe/ZnS QDs to PbS QDs in a solution based LSC design.213 The LSC had a G of 11 (single edge) and a ηopt = 1.4% (single edge) and a ηopt = 12.4% (full perimeter) for PbS compared to a ηopt = 0.5% (single edge) for CdSe/ZnS. The PCE (full perimeter) for these samples is reported as 3.2% and 1.3% for PbS and CdSe/ZnS respectively. PbS LSC showed strong red shifting of emission wavelength with increased PbS concentration, due to reabsorption of luminescence and was an indication of the size polydispersity in the sample. The PbS LSC also showed a minimal QY of 35% when compared to a QY of 50% for CdSe/ZnS, but this was offset by a smaller absorption–emission overlap and an increased spectral response, with the onset of absorption occurring at 800 nm compared to 600 nm for CdSe/ZnS, both of which produced the overall higher efficiency. Also illustrated in this study was the photo-instability of PbS QDs in a polymer matrix, which showed two forms of decay, a slow process termed photobleaching, which caused a permanent decrease in Ilsc of 0.1% per minute, and a faster process termed photodarkening, which was reversible.
Finally, a novel cylindrical QD LSC was created using PbS QDs incorporated into a PMMA matrix.115 The PbS QDs were 2.2 nm in diameter and showed first exciton absorption at ∼750 nm, with emission occurring at ∼890 nm in solution. Incorporation of QDs into PMMA resulted in a small red shift of absorption and a reduction of QY to 60% of its value in solution. Two types of cylindrical LSCs were created, a solid cylinder LSC and a ‘hollow’ cylinder LSC, both of which measured 25 mm in length and 6 mm in radius (Fig. 8). The hollow LSC consisted of an outer shell of QD doped PMMA measuring 2.2 mm in thickness, which encapsulated a non-doped core of 3.8 mm in radius. Both LSCs were doped with the same weight of QDs, resulting in a higher concentration of QDs in the doped section of the hollow LSC. Interestingly it has been shown that a higher level of incident light was absorbed (20–30%) while a lower amount of reabsorption took place, when using the hollow LSC design. The ηopt was then determined for a number of QD concentrations in both designs and compared to a planar LSC, with the hollow LSC (ηopt = 6.5%) outperforming the planar (ηopt = 3%) and solid cylinder (ηopt = 3.75%), using the same QD concentration.

6. Conclusions and outlook
In conclusion, there was a significant progress in the area of QD based LSCs over the last 10 years. A range of new LSC composite materials has demonstrated very promising efficiency and high performance values. However, there are still a number of challenges in this research area including low QYs of QDs in polymer matrixes, large absorption–emission overlaps and unknown long-term stability. There are also growing concerns about QD toxicity, particularly regarding II–VI Cd-based QDs. Potentially all of these issues seem manageable with greater use of the range of QDs that can be synthesised. It is expected that in the near future new Cd-free QDs with high QYs will be developed and the use of these nanomaterials will enable to address toxicity and recycling problems.
In addition looking forward to commercialisation of this technology, we believe that much greater attention should be paid to the synthesis of complex core–shell QD structures (including 1D quantum wires) and creation of second generation LSC devices.214 This would allow us to take the full advantage of the huge flexibility that QDs offer as lumiphores for LSCs and combine this with some of the more advanced LSC designs including microconcentrator arrays,215–217 stacked LSCs,7,70,106,218–221 photonic band stops,104–108,214 dye aligned concentrators,109–113 and plasmonic enhanced LSCs17,29,145 and/or photovoltaics222–224 in order to create a highly efficient LSC device. Overall, we think that QD based materials offer great opportunities in the development of new light harvesting devices and are highly important for the further development and commercialisation of solar energy technology.

 	Fig. 1  Diagram of an LSC, depicting a number of processes. (1) Light enters from the top surface and is absorbed by the dye in the LSC. (2) Light is remitted and trapped inside the LSC due to total internal reflection. (3) Re-emitted light incident upon the top surface with an angle larger than the critical angle, escapes the LSC. (4) Light is reabsorbed by another lumiphore. (5) Light is absorbed by the matrix. (6) Light is concentrated upon the PV cell. (7) Light passes through the LSC without absorption and is scattered back into the device by the diffuser.
