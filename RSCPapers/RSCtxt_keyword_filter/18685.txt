    , Accepted 18th September 2012First published on 20th September 2012AbstractTwo novel 56π-electron fullerenes, o-quinodimethane-methano[60]fullerene (OQMF) and thieno-o-quinodimethane-methano[60]fullerene (TOQMF), were prepared by Diels–Alder reaction between methano[60]fullerene and o-quinodimethane type dienes. These fullerenes possess not only high LUMO levels but also sterically small addends, featuring outstanding performance in polymer solar cells. Up to 5.74% and 5.51% PCEs were achieved for OQMF/P3HT and TOQMF/P3HT solar cells, respectively.
Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) employing electron-donating (p-type) and electron-accepting (n-type) organic semiconducting materials for solar energy harvesting are a promising alternative to silicon solar cells due to their low cost, light weight, mechanical flexibility and solution processing.1 Nowadays, new power conversion efficiency (PCE) records for OPVs are being continuously updated and are approaching 15% threshold for commercialization.2 Rapid progress in OPVs benefits from new materials and new fabrication technologies.3 Fullerenes and their derivatives have been widely used as acceptor materials for OPVs because of their outstanding electron affinity, electron mobility, and unique spherical structures.4 The benchmark fullerene acceptor materials are [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). Though PCE of the devices based on a blend of PCBM and conjugated polymer has exceeded 8%,5 there is still plenty of room for improving PCE by using new fullerene acceptors. One effective way is to develop high LUMO fullerene materials to improve the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of solar cells,6 since Voc is proportional to the energy level difference between the donor HOMO and acceptor LUMO.7 To lift fullerene LUMO, the most effective method is to shrink the fullerene π-electron system by multiple addition reactions. For example, the LUMO energy levels for 56π-electron fullerene bis-adducts and 54π-electron fullerene tris-adducts are generally 0.1–0.2 eV and 0.2–0.3 eV higher than that of the 58π-electron mono-adduct PC61BM.8 Several 56π-electron fullerene bis-adducts, such as bis-PCBM, ICBA, NCBA, DMPCBA, and bis-TOQC, have been synthesized and applied in polymer solar cells.9 Devices based on these acceptors and P3HT afforded a higher Voc (∼0.2 V higher) and a higher PCE (20–70% higher) than that of PC61BM/P3HT cells. However, the rise in Voc is always accompanied by a slight reduction in Jsc and (or) FF. The trade-off between Voc and Jsc (or FF) is related to the number and the bulkiness of the addends on fullerene. Bulky addends can hinder close-packing of fullerene and block electron transport, leading to low Jsc and FF.9i,10 Therefore, to synthesize high LUMO fullerenes with sterically small addends is a promising direction for advanced acceptor materials. Nakamura et al. recently reported several high LUMO fullerene acceptors based on methanofullerenes (C60CH2).11 The smallest addend –CH2– can effectively raise the fullerene LUMO while it does not interfere with fullerene packing. Thus, the trade-off between Voc and Jsc (or FF) could be suppressed. Here we report the synthesis of two new 56π-electron fullerenes, o-quinodimethane-methano[60]fullerene (OQMF) and thieno-o-quinodimethane-methano[60]fullerene (TOQMF), based on the Diels–Alder derivatization of methano[60]fullerene with o-quinodimethane type dienes.12 These fullerenes possess 0.11–0.13 eV higher LUMO levels than PC61BM. Encouragingly, solar cells based on OQMF and TOQMF acceptors show not only higher Voc but also improved Jsc and FF compared with those of PC61BM solar cells. Up to 5.74% PCE was achieved for OQMF/P3HT solar cells with conventional device structure and 5.51% PCE for TOQMF/P3HT solar cells with inverted structure.
The synthetic routes for OQMF and TOQMF are shown in Scheme 1. The starting material methano[60]fullerene was prepared through oxidation of silylmethylfullerene hydride by CuCl2.11a OQMF and TOQMF were synthesized through Diels–Alder reaction by addition of o-quinodimethane and thieno-o-quinodimethane dienes to methano[60]fullerene in 29% and 17% yield, respectively. The diene intermediates were generated in situ by I− promoted elimination reaction of 1,2-bis(bromomethyl)benzene and 2,3-bis(chloromethyl)thiophene. Thieno-o-quinodimethane diene is more reactive than o-quinodimethane diene, causing lower yield of TOQMF. 1H NMR spectra of OQMF and TOQMF indicate that they are composed of several regio-isomers. The integral ratios between aromatic protons (7.0–8.0 ppm) and aliphatic protons (3.0–5.0 ppm) are 1:1.5 and 1:3 for OQMF and TOQMF, respectively, indicating that only one equivalent diene was added to fullerene (Fig. S1 and S3†). MALDI-TOF mass spectra afforded the expected molecular weight, 838.3 and 844.2, for OQMF and TOQMF, respectively. UV-Vis spectra of PC61BM, OQMF, and TOQMF in CHCl3 are shown in Fig. 1. OQMF and TOQMF absorb more light at 400–520 nm than PC61BM does. The optical bandgaps estimated from the absorption edges are 1.97 eV and 1.99 eV for OQMF and TOQMF, respectively (Table 1). OQMF and TOQMF show good solubility in ODCB (>1.0% wt), and good thermal stability (Td > 240 °C), so they are suitable for OPV applications (Fig. S5†). During the second heating processes, DSC curves for OQMF and TOQMF show no endothermic peaks, suggesting that they might be amorphous (Fig. S6†).11b,13,14 Further experimental verification is ongoing.

The electrochemical properties of fullerene derivatives were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Half-wave reduction potentials, onset reduction potentials, and the estimated LUMO levels of fullerene derivatives are listed in Table 1. Compared with that of PC61BM, reduction potentials for OQMF and TOQMF show negative shifts (Fig. 2). The estimated LUMO levels of OQMF and TOQMF are 0.13 eV and 0.11 eV higher than that of PC61BM, respectively. Regarding that the substituents on the addends have little influence on fullerene energy levels, the lift in LUMO levels of OQMF and TOQMF can be attributed to the shrink in the fullerene π-electron system. High LUMO levels for OQMF and TOQMF are favorable for providing high Voc for solar cells.

Both conventional (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/fullerene:P3HT/Ca/Al) and inverted (ITO/ZnO/fullerene:P3HT/MoO3/Ag) bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells were fabricated to evaluate the performance of OQMF and TOQMF, and PC61BM was used as a reference. Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE for the optimized solar cells under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) are listed in Table 2. J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3. First, we optimized the D/A ratio, film thickness, and annealing temperature for the devices with conventional structure (Fig. S7–S9†). Solar cells with a D/A ratio of 1:0.6 (w/w) and an active layer thickness of 110 nm, by annealing at 170 °C for 10 min gave the best results. Compared with PC61BM solar cells, both OQMF and TOQMF solar cells exhibit higher PCE. The best PCE for OQMF and TOQMF solar cells are 5.74% and 4.91%, respectively, which are 51% and 30% higher than that of PC61BM solar cells (3.79%). As expected, OQMF and TOQMF solar cells show higher Voc (0.81 V for OQMF and 0.80 V for TOQMF) than that of PC61BM solar cells (0.64 V) due to their higher LUMO levels. Moreover, a higher Jsc of 11.19 mA cm−2 and FF of 63.4% were obtained from OQMF devices. Simultaneous improvement of Voc, Jsc, and FF for OQMF solar cells indicates great potential of the OQMF acceptor and proves that a small –CH2– addend is indeed effective in suppressing the trade-off between Voc and Jsc (or FF). For TOQMF solar cells, a higher Jsc of 10.36 mA cm−2 and slightly lower FF of 59.4% were obtained compared with those of PC61BM solar cells. We also applied these materials in solar cells with an inverted structure. OQMF and TOQMF inverted solar cells afforded a high PCE of 5.37% and 5.51%, which are 29% and 33% higher than that of PC61BM devices (4.15%), respectively. For TOQMF cells, simultaneously improved Voc of 0.79 V, Jsc of 10.93 mA cm−2, and FF of 63.8% were realized compared with those of PC61BM reference cells. TOQMF inverted cells show significantly higher FF and PCE than those of its conventional cells, which result from the decrease in series resistance (Rs). The different compatibility between the donor (or acceptor) and PEDOT (or ZnO) might cause difference in phase separation especially at the blend/PEDOT and blend/ZnO interfaces, leading to difference in charge carrier collection efficiency.

J–V curves for solar cells using PC61BM, OQMF or TOQMF as acceptors. (a) Conventional structure and (b) inverted structure. 
External quantum efficiencies (EQEs) for PC61BM, OQMF, and TOQMF inverted cells are shown in Fig. 4. Higher EQE values were observed for OQMF and TOQMF cells in the 400–600 nm region compared with PC61BM cells. This result is consistent with the higher Jsc of OQMF and TOQMF cells and suggests that the photon to electron conversion processes are rather efficient in these devices. Better Jsc and FF for OQMF and TOQMF cells suggest good electron mobility of the two acceptors. The electron mobilities of PC61BM, OQMF, and TOQMF were measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S10†). OQMF and TOQMF have similar electron mobility, 6.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, higher than that of PC61BM (5.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1).

Thermal annealing improves the performance of OQMF and TOQMF solar cells greatly. With annealing at 170 °C, PCEs were enhanced by 61% and 69% for OQMF/P3HT and TOQMF/P3HT solar cells, respectively. The morphology of OQMF/P3HT and TOQMF/P3HT blend films without and with thermal annealing was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 5). After thermal annealing, the RMS roughness increased from 0.782 nm to 0.995 nm for the OQMF/P3HT film and from 0.984 nm to 1.390 nm for the TOQMF/P3HT film. Enhanced crystallization of P3HT accounts for this roughening. Highly crystalline P3HT possesses high hole mobility which favors improvement in charge transport, leading to higher Jsc and FF.15

In summary, two new 56π-electron methanofullerene derivatives OQMF and TOQMF were developed. These acceptors possess not only high LUMO levels but also sterically small addends, featuring outstanding performance in polymer solar cells with either conventional structure or inverted structure. Using these materials in polymer solar cells, Voc, Jsc, and FF could be simultaneously enhanced compared with PC61BM/P3HT cells. Up to 5.74% and 5.51% PCEs were achieved for OQMF/P3HT and TOQMF/P3HT solar cells, respectively. Further applying these novel acceptors in low band gap polymer solar cells is currently ongoing.
