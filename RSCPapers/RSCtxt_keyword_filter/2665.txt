    , Accepted 15th April 2019First published on 15th April 2019AbstractIn this study, we fabricated a bulk-heterojunction organic photodetector with high detectivity by using a naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole-based narrow-bandgap π-conjugated polymer of PNTT as the donor and a fullerene derivative PC71BM as the acceptor. The relatively high mobility of PNTT allows the construction of a thick-film photoactive layer, which results in an increase in external quantum efficiency and a dramatic reduction in the dark current density. The combination of these advantages leads to an obvious increase in the detectivity and enhanced film thickness. A device based on a film thickness of 400 nm exhibited a very low dark current density of 0.33 nA cm−2 and rectification in the order of 105 in the range of ±2 V. The resulting device exhibited high detectivity exceeding 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1 in the range of 350 to 800 nm, with a maximum detectivity of 4.00 × 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1 and a responsivity of 0.4 A W−1 at a working wavelength of 760 nm under a reverse bias of −0.1 V, which is among the highest values reported so far for organic photodetectors at this working wavelength without extra gains.
Introduction
Organic photodetectors (OPDs) have attracted tremendous attention because they can be used to detect and analyze radiation from various sources, such as portable smart electronics, and due to their importance in biological imaging and environmental monitoring.1–7 Generally, commercially available photodetectors are based on inorganic semiconductors such as crystalline silicon, germanium, and indium gallium arsenide as the photoactive layer.8 However, inorganic semiconductors are expensive because their fabrication processes are restricted by the processing temperature and high-vacuum conditions.9,10 Additionally, the forbidden bandwidth of inorganic materials determines the operating wavelength range, which limits their applications toward a broad spectral area.11,12 In contrast, organic semiconductors have various advantages, such as finely tunable absorption spectra, versatile chemical structures, and remarkable solubility in organic solvents at ambient temperatures, which enables the fabrication of portable electronic devices via low-cost printing.13–21 Although tremendous efforts have been devoted to the development of high-performance OPDs, only a few devices have achieved a detectivity (D*) of over 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1.22–27
In principle, the D* value of an OPD is limited by two factors: the light harvesting capability of the photoactive layer, which limits the light response, and the excessive dark current, which can lead to high noise.28,29 An effective strategy to simultaneously increase the light harvesting capability and reduce the dark current is to increase the thickness of the photoactive layer, because the series resistance will be enhanced with the increased film thickness. However, the film thickness is typically limited to <200 nm owing to the relatively low charge carrier mobility of organic semiconductors, and increasing the film thickness may lead to bimolecular recombination loss which is detrimental to the photocurrent.30–32 Such limitations can be overcome by using high-mobility polymers in the photoactive layer.
The recently developed high-mobility copolymer PNTT, which comprises a centrosymmetric naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (NT) unit, allows the high film-thickness tolerance of fabricated polymer solar cell devices, and the power conversion efficiency can remain over 9% with a photoactive layer thickness of 1 μm.33 By virtue of the high mobility of PNTT, we constructed an OPD photoactive layer by integrating PNTT with the fullerene derivative PC71BM. The resulting photoactive layer of PNTT:PC71BM exhibited a dramatically decreased dark current density (Jd) and an enhanced external quantum efficiency (EQE) when the thickness of the photoactive layer was increased from 150 to 400 nm. The combination of these advantages leads to a remarkable detectivity of 4.00 × 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1 and a responsivity (R) of 0.4 A W−1 at a working wavelength of 760 nm under a reverse bias of −0.1 V, which is among the highest values reported so far for OPDs without extra gains.34–39
Results and discussion
Optical and electrochemical properties
As shown in Fig. 1, the absorption spectra of PNTT with both high and low molecular weights show dual characteristics, with an absorption peak at 450 nm corresponding to the π–π* transition of the polymer-conjugated skeleton, and an absorption peak at 760 nm originating from the intramolecular charge-transfer effect. The absorption of PC71BM ranged from 300 to 700 nm. The absorption profile of the PNTT:PC71BM (1:1.5, wt:wt) blend film shows the characteristics of PNTT and PC71BM, showing a broad absorption band from 300 to 850 nm. The highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (ELUMO) energy levels of PNTT and PC71BM were −5.36/−3.48 and −5.90/−3.90 eV, respectively (Fig. 2c). The clear differences between the EHOMO and the ELUMO of such donor–acceptor combinations ensure the driving force for charge separation in the photoactive layer.

Device characterization
Based on a photoactive layer of PNTT:PC71BM with an optimized weight ratio of 1:1.5, we fabricated OPDs with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (10 nm)/PNTT:PC71BM (260 nm)/Ca/Al. To identify the effects of the molecular weight on the performance of the photodetectors, we selected two batches of PNTT with a high average molecular weight (Mn = 62.5 kDa, PNTT-H) and a low molecular weight (Mn = 35.9 kDa, PNTT-L). Interestingly, Fig. 2a shows that at a given bias of −0.1 V, devices based on PNTT-H:PC71BM exhibit a low dark current density (Jd) of 2.14 nA cm−2, which is much lower than 14.50 nA cm−2 for devices based on PNTT-L:PC71BM. It is also notable that the forward current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics in the semi-log show excellent linearity over five orders of magnitude in the range of ±2 V.
Devices based on both high and low molecular weight samples exhibited broad responses from about 300 to 850 nm, whereas the EQE values of the device based on PNTT-H were obviously higher than those obtained from the PNTT-L-based device. The hole-mobility as estimated from the hole-only device based on PNTT-H is 1.08 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is about two orders of magnitude higher than 4.69 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PNTT-L. The higher hole mobility of PNTT-H can be attributable to the more favorable film morphology (discussed in the following section). Thereby, the device based on PNTT-H:PC71BM shows a much higher EQE value of 59% than that of 37% for the PNTT-L:PC71BM-based device. The combination of a relatively high EQE and an extremely low Jd of the PNTT-H:PC71BM based device leads to a remarkable D* of 1.39 × 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1, which obviously outperforms that of 3.37 × 1012 cm Hz1/2 W−1 for the PNTT-L:PC71BM-based device (Fig. 2c). These observations highlight the importance of high molecular weight PNTT-H for practical applications. The detailed device parameters are summarized in Table 1.

It has been established that thick-film photoactive layers have a range of advantages over their thin-film counterparts, such as reduced sensitivity to defects, more effective harvesting of photons, and obviously reduced dark current density due to enhanced resistance.27,40,41 Considering that thick-film photoactive layers may effectively reduce the pinholes, and increase the resistance of the film,27,42,43 it is rational to suppose that the increasing thickness of the photoactive layer may effectively reduce the leakage current from the bulk layer and the interface and thus lead to a reduced dark current density.44,45 Given that the high molecular weight PNTT-H exhibited a much better performance than its low molecular weight counterpart PNTT-L, we used PNTT-H for further studying the effects of film thickness. As shown in Fig. 3a, at a given reverse bias, the Jd gradually decreased as the thickness of the photoactive layer increased. Specifically, at a reverse bias of −0.1 V the Jd decreased from 6.50 nA cm−2 to 0.33 nA cm−2 when the film thickness of the PNTT-H:PC71BM layer was increased from 150 to 400 nm. Note that such a low Jd is about two orders of magnitude lower than that of commercialized inorganic Si photodetectors,46 indicating the great potential of OPDs based on PNTT-H.
 Fig. 3  Dark current density–voltage (Jd–V) characteristics (a), EQE (b) and detectivity curves (c) of photodetectors based on photoactive layers with various thicknesses. Jd was measured in the dark, and EQE and D* were measured at a reverse bias of −0.1 V. 
In addition to the reduced Jd, a further advantage of enhancing the film thickness is that the EQE response also improved at a reverse bias of −0.1 V (Fig. 3b), corresponding to the enhanced short-circuit density, as indicated by the J–V characteristics. The combination of obviously reduced Jd and enhanced EQE led to a dramatically improved D* in the entire working band from 300 nm to about 800 nm (Fig. 3c). At a reverse bias of −0.1 V, the device with a PNTT-H:PC71BM layer thickness of 400 nm exhibited a maximum D* of 4.00 × 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1 at a working wavelength of 760 nm, obviously outperforming that of 7.61 × 1012 cm Hz1/2 W−1 for the device with an active layer thickness of 150 nm. To our knowledge, the observed D* and R values (Fig. S2, ESI†) are among the highest values reported so far for OPDs measured at a reverse bias of −0.1 V without extra gains.34–39 Moreover, the noise equivalent power (NEP) was calculated from the noise power density spectra at −0.1 V (Fig. S3, ESI†) based on the following equation.  where Sn is the noise power density of the device and Δf is the bandwidth. The corresponding D* calculated from the noise power density spectra was lower than that from Jd due to the 1/f noise.35 The detailed parameters are summarized in Table 2. It is also worth noting that these devices showed relatively high responsivity (R) values in the range of 0.35–0.41 A W−1. More importantly, the observed D* is superior to that of inorganic Si photodetectors in a wide range from 400 to 800 nm (Fig. S4, ESI†). These findings clearly indicate that PNTT-H shows better performance in the visible light and near-infrared region.

Film morphology
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was used to probe the molecular packing of both high and low molecular weight samples inside the blend films. As depicted in Fig. 4, the 2D GIWAXS images show the scattering features generated by each component. Both high and low molecular weight PNTT samples show a (010) π–π stacking peak in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction at q = 1.82 Å−1, and a (100) lamellar stacking reflection at q = 0.25 Å−1. The broad diffraction ring at q = 1.33 Å−1 is assigned to PC71BM, which overlaps with the amorphous halo of PNTT. The high molecular weight PNTT-H shows improved chain packing characteristics in the film. The OOP line-cut profiles show that the (010) peak arising from the PNTT-H shows a sharper and higher intensity than that from PNTT-L. Thus, by (010) peak fitting at the high q region (0.8–2.0 Å−1), PNTT-H shows a crystal coherence length (CCL) of 20.9 Å, which is larger than that of PNTT-L (16.9 Å). An estimation of the PNTT π–π stacking orientation distribution was performed by plotting the pole figures of the (010) reflections (Fig. 4d). Compared to PNTT-L, the intensity of PNTT-H is more centered at 90°, indicating that molecular co-facial packing is more parallel to the substrate with the increase in the molecular weight. Consequently, the combination of the larger CCL with a more “face-on” orientation of π–π stacking is favorable for the charge transport in the PNTT-H:PC71BM blend film, which is one of the origins of the enhanced EQE response. We note that the better face-on orientation of the PNTT-H based film would lead to a higher charge carrier transportation than that of the PNTT-L based film, thus leading to a higher dark current of the former. It is also worth noting that the more ordered structure may lead to a much lower probability for the formation of defects in the photoactive layer, which may in turn lead to a reduced dark current. When considering that the PNTT-H:PC71BM blend film presents a more ordered structure than PNTT-L:PC71BM (Fig. 4a), it seems rational that the formation of defects in the former is less pronounced than the latter, which corresponds to the lower Jd of the former.

Linear dynamic range
Typically, if the response of detectors is linear to the input signal, it can be specified as a linear dynamic range (LDR). This is an important parameter used to characterize the detection range of detectors, with a larger LDR indicating a wider detection range.47 To examine the linear responsivity of the devices dependent on light intensities, we estimated the LDR of the optimized photodetector using the following formula:  where Iupper and Ilower represent the upper and lower limits of incident light intensities, respectively. The measurements were recorded at 720 nm with monochromatic light, and the light intensity was adjusted with a set of neutral density filters. Fig. 5a and b show the J–V characteristics and the linear relationship between the photocurrent density and the incident light intensity at a bias of −0.1 V, respectively. The correlation coefficient is estimated to be 0.9999, and the slope of the fitting line is calculated to be 0.956, both of which are very close to unity and can be attributed to reduced recombination with weak incident light.48 The photodetector covered a relatively wide working range from 0.019 to 42.0 μW cm−2, corresponding to an LDR of 65.14 dB. Note that there was conditionality of the upper limit (42.0 μW cm−2) in our laboratory, which may lead to underestimation of the LDR value. Response speed and frequency are also important parameters for photodetectors.49,50 As shown in Fig. 5c, the cut-off frequency (defined at −3 dB) of the optimized device was ∼20 kHz, which is fast enough for practical applications. In addition, the rise time (Trise, defined as the time gap when the photocurrent rises from 10% to 90%) and the fall time (Tfall, defined as the time gap when the photocurrent drops from 90% to 10%) of the resulting device were measured to be 32 μs and 29 μs on average, respectively, at −0.1 V, indicating fast response. It is also worth noting that the response time is highly repeatable for multiple cycles (see Fig. S5 and Table S1, ESI†). The maximum Δf of the device was about 1.35 kHz, as calculated from the equation of Δf ≈ 0.35/Trise.

Conclusions
We fabricated a bulk heterojunction photodetector based on the high-mobility conjugated polymer PNTT that contained an electron-deficient unit of naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole and a fullerene derivative PC71BM as the photoactive layer. It is very interesting to note that the dark current density dramatically decreased and the external quantum efficiency increased with the increased thickness of the photoactive layer. An extremely low dark current density of 0.33 nA cm−2 was achieved at a PNTT:PC71BM film thickness of 400 nm. The optimized device exhibited a maximum detectivity of 4.00 × 1013 cm Hz1/2 W−1 at 760 nm under a reverse bias of −0.1 V, which is among the highest values so far reported for OPDs at this working wavelength without extra gains. The observed high performance and fast response time demonstrate that the fabricated thick-film OPD based on PNTT:PC71BM as the photoactive layer shows great promise for practical applications.
Experimental section
Device fabrication
PNTT was synthesized according to a previously reported procedure.33 PC71BM was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich without further purification. Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)–glass substrates were pre-cleaned sequentially by sonicating with isopropanol, then with deionized water, a detergent bath and isopropanol at room temperature, each for 15 min, and then dried in a baking oven overnight. The pre-cleaned ITO substrates were coated with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS, CLEVIOS P VP Al 4083, 1.0 mg mL−1 in water) by spin-coating (3000 rpm for 30 s, to a thickness of approximately 30 nm), and then baked at 150 °C for 15 min in air. Photoactive layer solutions (PNTT:PC71BM weight ratio 1:1.5) were prepared in 1,2-dichlorobenzene and stirred on a hot plate at 100 °C overnight to ensure complete dissolution. Before spin-coating, both photoactive layer solutions and ITO substrates were preheated on a hot plate at 100 °C. The photoactive layers were spin-coated from the hot photoactive layer solution onto the preheated substrate in a glove box at 1200 rpm for 60 s. The photoactive layer thickness was controlled by changing the concentration of the solution, for example, a 10 mg mL−1 solution (based on polymer concentration) typically gave a photoactive layer of 330 to 400 nm thickness. PNDIT-F3N–Br dissolved in methanol at a concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1 was spun onto the photoactive layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s to obtain a film of 5 nm. The thin films were transferred into a vacuum evaporator connected to the glove box, and Al (100 nm) was deposited sequentially through a shadow mask at 10−7 Pa, with a photoactive area of the cells of 0.0516 cm2.
Film and device characterization
The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the films on quartz substrates were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 SourceMeter (Tektronix, USA) using a 1 sun, AM 1.5G solar simulator (SS-F5-3A, Enlitech, Taiwan). Before testing, the light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell (certified by NREL) and a physical mask with an aperture precisely 4 mm2 was used to define the device area. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were obtained using a commercial EQE measurement system (QE-R, Enlitech, Taiwan). The J–V characteristics under illumination from a 720 nm beam (generated from a Zolix Omni-λ monochromator and a tungsten-halogen lamp) were measured using a Keithley 236 source-meter in an electrically and optically shielded box. The hole mobilities of PNTT-H and PNTT-L were evaluated via the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method (device structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al). The intensity of the 720 nm beam could be controlled through neutral density filters and calibrated using a low-power calibrated photodetector (Newport 818-UV/DB). The noise spectral density characteristics of the devices were recorded using a semiconductor parameter analyzer (Platform Design Automation, Inc. FS380 Pro™). The pulsed red light (620–630 nm) for cut-off frequency and response time measurements was generated using a red LED chip and a function generator (square wave, 50% duty ratio, Tektronix AFG1022), and we used a 4.7 kΩ resistor to convert photocurrent signals of our sample to voltage signals and an oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS3052B) to record them. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements of the PNTT:PC71BM blend films were performed using a Xenocs 2.0 system with an Excillum MetalJet-D2 X-ray source operating at 70.0 kV, 2.8570 mA, and with a beam wavelength of 1.34144 Å. The sample to detector distance was ∼226 mm and the incidence angle was set at 0.20°. Scattering signals were collected using a 2-dimensional detector (Pilatus3R 1M, Dectris) with a pixel size of 0.172 × 0.172 mm2. The films were spin-coated atop the silicon wafer/PEDOT:PSS substrates and the film preparation was the same as device fabrication.
