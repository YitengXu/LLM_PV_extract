    , Accepted 17th August 2016First published on 17th August 2016AbstractHigh-quality CuInSe2 (CISe) nanowires have been prepared by a one-step evaporation process. The presented growth process results in a composite material consisting of CISe NWs on top of a polycrystalline CISe base layer. The nanowires were extensively characterized by transmission electron microscopy, confirming their composition and atomic-scale crystal structure with a very low number of structural defects. From these analyses, we infer that the growth axis is along the [111] direction. The polycrystalline base layer has a tetragonal chalcopyrite structure and is optically active as confirmed by X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence (PL) analysis, respectively. Potential applications of this composite CISe NW/base-layer material for photovoltaic energy conversion are supported by the reduced reflectivity of the material and its strong PL intensity. The presented growth method is based on elemental evaporation under vacuum conditions, which makes the process compatible with the fabrication of photovoltaic devices.
Introduction
Chalcopyrite materials Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe) have received significant attention recently due to their unique structural and optoelectronic properties, which include a high absorption coefficient1 in the visible range, beneficial defect and interface properties,2,3 and benign grain boundaries.4–6 With a direct band gap between 1.04 eV and 1.68 eV (ref. 1), they are ideally suited for photovoltaic (PV) and photo electro chemical energy conversion, i.e. CIGSe based thin-film solar cells reach a power conversion efficiency of 22.6%.7
On the other hand, the use of nanostructures in the form of nanowires (NWs) and nanotubes has recently received considerable attention in numerous fields, including nanoelectronics, biotechnology, and energy storage and conversion.8 In particular, the application in PV power conversion is interesting due to the large area to volume ratio, which is beneficial for effective light absorption and charge separation.9–11 It has been shown that the Shockley–Queisser limit for a single p–n junction under one sun can be exceeded by a nanowire solar cell.12 Thus, NWs present a promising way for achieving higher efficiency solar cells13,14 and reducing costs by enabling materials savings.9,11
The vapour–liquid–solid (VLS) growth is a prevalent mechanism by which materials are grown one-dimensionally into high-quality NWs, nano-rods, -whiskers, or -belts. In the conventional VLS growth mechanism, proposed by Wagner and Ellis,15 a metal droplet acts as a catalyst for a 1D growth process. VLS growth can be realized by metal–organic vapour phase epitaxy (MOVPE), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), or vacuum deposition, e.g. by physical vapour deposition (PVD) or molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Depending on the materials and applications, the catalyst incorporation may harm the intrinsic electrical and optical properties of the NWs.16 Self-catalytic growth methods,17i.e. without an external catalytic seed, were developed for several III–V and group IV materials16,18–23 in the last decade.
Although still in an early stage of research, the formation and application of NWs of CIGSe materials has also been reported. CIGSe NWs are grown using solution-based techniques,24,25 template electrodeposition26 and solution growth,27 or employing the VLS growth mode in CVD.28 The phase transformation of NWs of one (compound) material serving as a precursor has been reported for the formation of CuInSe2 (CISe) NWs, employing solution-based29,30 or solid-state reactions.31,32 However, in view of the potential application of CIGSe NWs, it is noteworthy that the fabrication of high-efficiency CIGSe thin-film solar cells requires a co-evaporation based method under vacuum conditions.1
Here we report a single-step growth method for a composite CISe material consisting of self-catalytic CISe NWs which grow on top of a polycrystalline base layer. We confirm the optoelectronic activity of the CISe base layer and the tetragonal crystal structure of the CISe NWs. The beneficial reflection properties of the composite CISe NW/base layer material are demonstrated.
Experimental
All samples were grown in a molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) system (Omicron EVO 50) by evaporating high purity elemental source materials on Si substrates. Conventional hot lip Knudsen cells were used as Cu and In evaporation cells and a valved cracker cell was used to evaporate Se. Boron-doped p-type Si(100) pieces were used as substrates. The substrates were cleaned following standard RCA Si cleaning procedures.33 For one substrate (subsequently referred to as the reference), the native oxide layer was removed by wet etching using buffered HF solution as described by Higashi et al.34 After introduction in the growth chamber, the substrates were outgassed at 600 °C for 15 min and then cooled down to the growth temperature. The background pressure in the reaction chamber was in the range 10−7 mbar during the deposition.
The evaporation rates of individual elements were ∼1 Å min−1 for Cu and 2–7 Å min−1 for In. Se was evaporated in excess at least 30 times. The total deposition rates were determined to be 5 to 7 Å min−1 using a stylus profilometer. To increase deposition homogeneity, the substrates were rotated at 10 rpm. To avoid the loss of Se during the cool-down phase, the samples were cooled down from the growth temperature to 300 °C at 10 °C min−1 under Se flux. Below 300 °C, the cooling rate was reduced to approximately 5 °C min−1 and the Se flux was ceased. After removal from the MBE system, the samples presented a non-specular black surface for Cu-poor and stoichiometric compositions and a dark-bluish colour for Cu-rich compositions. The growth conditions for all samples are summarized in Table 1.

The crystal structure of the samples was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a PanAnalytical X'Pert PRO MRD system. θ–2θ diffractograms were acquired in the Bragg–Brentano configuration using Cu-Kα radiation. The surface morphology was determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a FEI Quanta 650 FEG SEM microscope. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was performed in the same microscope to determine the [Cu]/[In] ratio of the samples.
For transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments, the NWs were prepared by mechanical scratching in isopropanol solution and drop-transfer to Lacey carbon (Au mesh) or Holey carbon (Cu mesh) TEM grids. An FEI Titan 200 kV ChemiStem microscope with probe correction was used to acquire high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM) images. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) and EDS experiments (standard-less) were performed. The diffraction patterns were indexed following the CISe PDF card #04-007-4441 reference of the International Centre for Diffraction Data.
Photoluminescence (PL) experiments were performed in a liquid He flux cryostat using a Bruker IFS 66v Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, equipped with a liquid N2-cooled Ge detector. The excitation source was the 514.5 nm line of an Ar+ laser (spot diameter of ∼1 mm). PL spectra were taken at 5 K with an excitation power of 5 mW, measured in front of the cryostat window.
Optical reflection measurements were performed in a PerkinElmer UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer Lambda 950 equipped with a 60 mm InGaAs integrating sphere. BaSO4 mirrors were used as references and a 7° angle between the sample and the incident light beam was used to allow the sphere to measure the total reflectance.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the results of growth process A (see Table 1) with [Cu]/[In] = 0.8 and at Tg = 530 °C. The formation of NWs on a polycrystalline layer is clearly observed for Si(100) substrates with a native SiO2 layer. The NWs grow in two distinct morphologies on the polycrystalline base layer, exhibiting a blade-like shape, some with straight side facets (Fig. 1b) and others with saw-tooth faceting on one side (Fig. 1c). For reference samples (where the native SiO2 layer was removed by wet chemical etching prior to the growth) grown by the same growth process, no formation of NWs can be observed (Fig. 1d). In comparison with common CIGSe growth35 used for the fabrication of PV devices, our growth process differs in two parameters: (i) the Se excess is significantly higher in our case (for CIGSe absorbers typically an excess of 10 times is used36) and (ii) the growth rate is significantly lower in our case. We attribute the unusual formation of NWs to these differences.

Two distinct growth morphologies of the NWs are observed: (b) NWs with a rectangular cross section and straight sides and (c) NWs with saw-tooth faceting on one side. (d) Reference samples, grown during the same growth process on HF-etched Si(100) substrates, show a polycrystalline CISe film without the formation of NWs. 
Polycrystalline base layer
The formation of NWs is observed on top of a thin polycrystalline base layer. Using XRD, the polycrystalline layer is identified as tetragonal CISe (Fig. S1†).37,38 Additionally, the XRD spectrum indicates the presence of CuSe2 and CuO3Se minority phases.37,39 Copper selenide is a well-known impurity phase present in CISe and CIGSe thin-film samples grown under nearly stoichiometric and under Cu-rich conditions,40–42 and can be efficiently removed by chemical etching.
Nanowires
After confirming that the polycrystalline base layer is indeed CISe, we now turn to the detailed analysis of the NWs. To characterize the structure of the NWs, we analysed several NWs individually by HR-STEM and SAED. Fig. 2a shows a high angle annular dark field (HAADF) image of a NW grown in process A. The corresponding, and 90° rotated, {110} zone axis SAED pattern from the central part of this NW (Fig. 2b) confirms the tetragonal CISe crystal structure of the NW. The elongated shape of some of the diffractions spots could be explained by the presence of small rotated crystal domains in the NW. However, such defects were not observed in atomically resolved HR-STEM images. Fig. 2c shows an atomically resolved HR-STEM image of the NW, rotated to align the atomic dumbbell axis with the fast scan direction. An atomic structure projection for tetragonal CISe was superimposed to the HR-STEM image, matching the atomic positions with an overall deviation of 3%. This deviation was caused by drift and distortion of the specimen during image acquisition. The growth direction of the NW was determined from the SAED patterns. All analysed wires are compatible with two possible growth directions, [111] and [112].

(c) Atomically resolved HR-STEM image combined with an atomic structure projection of the CISe tetragonal crystalline phase. 
EDS analysis of the same NW (Fig. 3) shows a homogeneous distribution of Cu, In, and Se. The standard-less quantification of the acquired EDS spectra confirms the CuInSe2 stoichiometry. All investigated NWs present similar features.38
 Fig. 3  (a) HAADF image and EDS mapping for (b) Cu, (c) In, and (d) Se of a NW from growth process A. The EDS spectrum is shown in (e). The standard-less quantification of the EDS spectrum is given as an inset to (e). 
The NWs are randomly distributed over the entire surface of the samples. We statistically analysed more than 400 NWs using SEM imaging. The length, width, and thickness of the blade-shaped NWs follow Gaussian distributions with an average length of <L> = (1.72 ± 0.70) μm, an average thickness of <t> = (46 ± 17) nm, and an average width of <w> = (94 ± 46) nm (see Fig. S2†38). These results indicate that the growth rate of the NWs is approximately 5 times higher than that of the polycrystalline CISe thin film, considering the thickness of the polycrystalline base layer to be ∼350 nm (see Fig. S3†38). None of the NWs showed any indication of the presence of a metal nanoparticle at the NW tip.
Nanowire growth model
To investigate the details of the growth process, we varied the growth conditions, by changing on one hand the growth temperature Tg and on the other hand the In evaporation rate (Table 1). The density of NWs (Fig. 4a) is found to decrease with increasing growth temperature Tg (processes A, C, and E). Higher In evaporation rates lead to a slightly higher density of NWs (processes A and B, or C and D); however, the higher In evaporation rate also affects the [Cu]/[In] composition of the material.

(b) Atomistic illustration of a CISe NW on top of the polycrystalline base layer, indicating the [111] growth direction and the likely facets of the NWs. The inset shows a side view to illustrate the angle between the grain surface and the NW. 
In most reported studies, NWs are grown directly on a substrate, either by using previously deposited metal seed particles, or by inducing wire growth by substrate modification. The NW growth reported here is unique in that the NWs grow on top of a polycrystalline base layer of the same material. While this composite NW/base layer material has beneficial properties for photovoltaic applications (see below), it also requires a careful consideration of the growth mechanism leading to the NW formation. We propose a VLS growth mechanism for the observed CISe NWs. However, no metallic seed particles were intentionally deposited prior to the CISe growth, nor could we identify any droplet at the tip of the NWs after the growth. This indicates that the growth is likely self-catalysed. The Se overpressures used in our depositions are not compatible with the formation of metallic In or Cu on the surface during the growth process. Nevertheless, for temperatures above 530 °C, both Cu–Se and In–Se exist in a liquid phase according to their phase diagrams.43,44 Considering that our growth parameter variation indicated a higher density of NWs for higher In evaporation rates, we propose the following growth mechanism for NW formation. During the growth of the polycrystalline CISe base layer, liquid In–Se droplets form on the surface. If the droplet size is above a critical size, a NW starts to grow. From the TEM analysis, the possible growth direction was identified to be the [111] or [112] direction. It is well known that the most stable facets of the tetragonal Cu-chalcopyrites are the {112} facets.45 Considering the rectangular cross section of the NWs, we favour the [111] growth direction. For this, we identify the large faces of the blade-like NWs to be the {112} facets, while the smaller side faces are assigned to the {110} facets, as illustrated in Fig. 4b. The saw-tooth-like faceting of one side observed for some NWs is due to a faceting of the {110} face into {112} facets. Such faceting has been previously observed on the surface of thin films46 and is compatible with the angles observed in the SEM images.
At this point, we do not have a clear explanation for the observed lack of formation of NWs on the etched Si(100) reference samples. The formation of NWs on the native-oxide covered Si(100) occurs on top of the polycrystalline base layer. We speculate that the formation of In–Se droplets has to occur in a position with the appropriate crystal facet orientation leading to the NW growth. The polycrystalline base layer favours such facets, while the CISe layer growing on the etched Si(100) might not favour the development of these specific facets. To fully understand the lack of NW formation on HF-etched Si(100) substrates, further detailed studies have to be performed, which is out of the scope of the present work.
Optical properties in view of solar cell application
Finally, we characterise the optical properties of the prepared NW/base-layer composite material in view of their application in solar energy conversion. Fig. 5 presents the PL spectra for two samples grown by process A, where one sample was grown on a Si(100) substrate with native oxide and exhibits the formation of NWs, and a reference sample, grown on a HF-etched Si(100) substrate without the formation of NWs.
 Fig. 5  Photoluminescence spectra (taken at 5 K) for samples from growth process A, grown on Si(100) with native oxide exhibiting the formation of NWs (solid line), and the respective reference sample grown on HF-etched Si(100) without NW formation (dashed line). The sharp emissions are related to the Si substrate. The spectra were normalized to the Si substrate-related emission at 1.092 eV to ensure comparability. 
Both samples show a strong and broad emission at energy values below the bandgap energy of CISe (1.02 eV (ref. 47)). Such broad emissions are typical of Cu-poor polycrystalline CISe thin films and their energy position can vary significantly depending on the composition of the samples.47 We note that the sharp emissions at 0.767 eV (ref. 48) and at 1.092 eV (ref. 49) are related to the Si substrate. There are two meaningful differences between the emissions of the two samples: (i) for the sample with NWs, the PL emission located at ∼0.82 eV is more intense than that of the reference sample, despite the fact that the polycrystalline base layer of this sample is thinner than the reference sample (see Fig. S3†38) and (ii) the reference sample shows a pronounced shoulder at the high-energy side of the main peak, at ∼0.9 eV. Previous works by several authors have shown similar emissions which were associated with donor–acceptor pair transitions.50–54 However, considering the broad PL and asymmetric spectra, as well as the (Cu-poor) non-stoichiometry of the samples, random local fluctuating potentials55,56 should play an important role in these samples, creating different radiative channels in comparison with lightly doped materials. Further investigations are necessary in order to fully understand both emissions, and the particular optical properties of the NWs. However, such a systematic study is out of the scope of the present paper.
Considering the excellent light absorption properties of CIGSe and the record power conversion efficiencies of CIGSe thin-film solar cells,7 we propose the application of the prepared composite CISe NW/base-layer material for photovoltaic power conversion. To evaluate the influence of the NWs on the light absorption properties, we compare the reflectance of the NW/base-layer composite material with that of a bare Si wafer, an epitaxial CISe sample, a CIGSe co-evaporated PV grade sample, and the reference CISe thin-film sample without NWs (Fig. 6). The sample with the NWs reflects significantly less than all other samples. Such low reflectivity is in accordance with higher light trapping properties that is commonly encountered in low-dimensional structures and is beneficial for solar cell devices.
 Fig. 6  Comparison of the optical reflectance of the CuInSe2 sample with NWs (process A) with those of various other samples. The sample with the NWs has the lowest reflectance. The oscillations for the CIGSe PV-grade sample are due to interferences, which are not seen for the thinner CuInSe2 samples. 
Conclusions
A single step evaporation-based growth process for chalcopyrite CISe NWs on Si(100) substrates with native oxide was presented. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the formation of CISe NWs on top of a polycrystalline base layer. The NWs were confirmed to exhibit a high crystalline quality and their formation does not require any external catalyst. We propose a vapour–liquid–solid growth mechanism based on an indium selenide seed particle as a growth model. The presence of a thin polycrystalline base layer, the reduced reflectance, and the growth by a co-evaporation method (which is used for the growth of the best CIGSe solar cells) present interesting advantages for their use in photovoltaic applications.

 	Fig. 1  Scanning electron microscopy characterization of samples from growth process A. (a) Tilted view image of the growth on a Si(100) substrate with native oxide showing the formation of NWs on top of a polycrystalline base layer. Two distinct growth morphologies of the NWs are observed: (b) NWs with a rectangular cross section and straight sides and (c) NWs with saw-tooth faceting on one side. (d) Reference samples, grown during the same growth process on HF-etched Si(100) substrates, show a polycrystalline CISe film without the formation of NWs.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) HAADF image of a single CISe NW grown by process A on a Si(100) substrate with native oxide. (b) SAED pattern acquired at the indicated position on the NW in (a). (c) Atomically resolved HR-STEM image combined with an atomic structure projection of the CISe tetragonal crystalline phase.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) HAADF image and EDS mapping for (b) Cu, (c) In, and (d) Se of a NW from growth process A. The EDS spectrum is shown in (e). The standard-less quantification of the EDS spectrum is given as an inset to (e).	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Analysis of the NW density as a function of the growth conditions. The letters refer to the growth process; see Table 1. The dashed line is a guide for the eye. (b) Atomistic illustration of a CISe NW on top of the polycrystalline base layer, indicating the [111] growth direction and the likely facets of the NWs. The inset shows a side view to illustrate the angle between the grain surface and the NW.	 

 	Fig. 5  Photoluminescence spectra (taken at 5 K) for samples from growth process A, grown on Si(100) with native oxide exhibiting the formation of NWs (solid line), and the respective reference sample grown on HF-etched Si(100) without NW formation (dashed line). The sharp emissions are related to the Si substrate. The spectra were normalized to the Si substrate-related emission at 1.092 eV to ensure comparability.	 

 	Fig. 6  Comparison of the optical reflectance of the CuInSe2 sample with NWs (process A) with those of various other samples. The sample with the NWs has the lowest reflectance. The oscillations for the CIGSe PV-grade sample are due to interferences, which are not seen for the thinner CuInSe2 samples.
