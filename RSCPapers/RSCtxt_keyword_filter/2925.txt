1. Introduction
Gallium oxide (Ga2O3) has great potential in the next-generation electronic and optoelectronics applications.1–8 Because of its ultrawide bandgap of ∼4.9 eV and critical breakdown field of 8 MV cm−1, Ga2O3 has a Baliga figure of merit (BFOM) of 3000 or larger, which is several times larger than that of GaN and SiC.9 Herein, Ga2O3 shows high-efficiency performance as a power device channel for lower specific on-resistance at a high breakdown voltage and then delivers higher power but less consumption.10–18 Moreover, the absorption cut-off wavelength of Ga2O3 is in the deep ultraviolet range of 260–280 nm; thus, it can be used to fabricate solar-blind photodetectors without the need of complex alloying processes such as ZnxMg1−xO and AlxGa1−xN.19–27 Ga2O3 also has high dielectric constant, high optical transparency, excellent chemical and thermodynamic stability, and can be applied as transistor gate dielectrics and passivation layers, in high temperature gas sensing, transparent conducting oxides, solar cells, light-emitting diodes, in the detection of nuclear radiation, etc.28–34
Ga2O3 thin films could be prepared by various deposition techniques such as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), halide vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE), metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), pulsed laser deposition (PLD), magnetron sputtering, thermal evaporation, and atomic layer deposition (ALD).35–51 ALD is indeed a special chemical vapor deposition technique, in which the precursors or reactants are introduced onto the substrate layer by layer for controlled reaction to fabricate the target films. The sequential and self-saturating reactions ensure excellent conformality on high-aspect ratio structures, precise thickness control at the atomic scale, and high uniformity in both thickness and composition at a low substrate temperature.52–55 ALD processes use either molecular species or reactive species in the plasma state as oxidizing or reducing reactant. The former process is termed thermal ALD since thermal energy is the only available energy source for reactions, while the latter is termed plasma-enhanced ALD (PEALD) since highly reactive radicals contribute to chemical reactions using a radio frequency power generator. In comparison with thermal ALD, PEALD usually expands the options of precursors and reduces the growth temperature.56,57
To our knowledge, ALD and PEALD were firstly adopted to prepare Ga2O3 thin films in 199658 and in 2005,59 respectively. For the performed excellent characteristics of high uniformity in thickness and composition, ideal bandgap, and variable crystal structures after thermal treatment, ALD-deposited Ga2O3 films have attracted considerable attention in recent years.60–70 They have been widely used for solar-blind photodetectors, transistor gate dielectrics, silicon surface passivation, solar cells, water splitting, random access memories, etc.32,67,71–74 Hence, a systematic review for the growth characteristics and properties of Ga2O3 films via the ALD method is urgently needed. In this review, we summarized the precursors for the ALD deposition of Ga2O3 films firstly, and then the characterization methods and influences of growth parameters on the growth rate, crystal structure, elemental composition, surface roughness, optical bandgap, and refractive index of Ga2O3 films were analyzed and discussed.
2. Precursors
The precursors are fundamental to the ALD processes. A good precursor should be thermally stable on the substrate at the growth temperature and can react with a second reactant rapidly and efficiently to synthesize the desired material. High volatility is also important for ALD precursors to deposit thin films on high aspect ratio or porous substrates at low temperature. As for Ga2O3, several Ga compounds could be used as Ga precursors, as listed in Table 1, while H2O, O3, and O2 plasma are commonly used as the O precursors, which show distinct reactivity with different Ga precursors.

Nieminen et al. prepared Ga2O3 thin films firstly by ALD using Ga(acac)3 (acac = pentane-2,4-dionate) as the Ga precursor, in which the Ga source was evaporated at 130 °C to ensure an ideal sublimation behavior. A temperature-independent growth rate of 0.33 Å per cycle was obtained in the range of 365–380 °C when H2O was used as the oxygen source. A growth rate of 0.28 Å per cycle was obtained using O3 as the oxidizer at 370 °C, but no Ga2O3 film was detected if O2 was used as the oxygen source. Besides, the Ga2O3 films grown with H2O contained a considerable amount of carbon as the impurity, whereas the films grown with O3 had a carbon content of only about 1 atom%.58
Ga2O3 thin films were firstly deposited using the PEALD technique with an alternating supply of [(CH3)2GaNH2]3 and O2 plasma at a substrate temperature of 200 °C. As shown in Fig. 1, one deposition cycle consisted of four pulses in sequence: [(CH3)2GaNH2]3 vapor pulse with Ar carrier gas for 0.1 s, Ar purge gas pulse for 2 s, O2 plasma pulse for 1 s, and Ar purge gas pulse for 0.4 s. The as-prepared Ga2O3 films showed excellent step coverage characteristics and smooth surfaces with a roughness down to 4 Å.59 Similar reactions were also carried out at 50, 150, and 250 °C, and all the as-prepared Ga2O3 films exhibited smooth surface morphologies.75

Dezelah et al. fabricated Ga2O3 films at a high growth rate of 1.0 Å per cycle by ALD using Ga2(NMe2)6 sublimated at 70–72 °C as the Ga precursor and H2O as the O precursor at substrate temperature from 170 to 250 °C. Ga2(NMe2)6 having dimeric structure had high surface density and high reactivity with H2O.76 Baji et al. also deposited Ga2O3 films using Ga2(NMe2)6 and deionized water with a growth rate of 0.4–0.8 Å per cycle at 130–270 °C. However, the condensation of Ga precursor and uneven growth of films occurred at lower temperature of 130 °C, while inhomogeneous rough CVD-like films were evidenced at higher temperature of 270 °C.77 O′Donoghue et al. combined the same Ga precursor, whereas O2 plasma as the O precursor was used to create an efficient low temperature PEALD process for the deposition of high-quality Ga2O3 thin films. Due to the reactive nature of the highly volatile Ga precursor maintained at 110 °C and plasma species, a growth rate as high as 1.5 Å per cycle was verified at a substrate temperature range of 60–160 °C.78
Lee et al. employed DMGIP (Me2GaOiPr) and H2O as the precursors. The vapor pressure of the non-pyrophoric liquid Ga precursor was 0.55, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.3 Torr at 25, 30, 35, and 40 °C, respectively. The TGA (thermogravimetric analysis) curve revealed that the evaporation of precursor was fast at 100 °C and almost completed at 125 °C. The precursor could be safely heated without decomposition at 100 °C or below, judging from the DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) curves; thereby, the DMGIP was maintained at 95 °C in the ALD process. The pulse time for the Ga precursor and O precursor were set to 5 s and 2 s, and the purge time was fixed at 25 s or 30 s. Accordingly, a growth rate of ∼1.5 Å per cycle was obtained for the deposition of Ga2O3 films at 300–325 °C.79 However, they also reported a growth rate of 0.28 Å per cycle at 280–300 °C using the same Ga and O sources, although the purge time was prolonged to 60 s or 90 s.80
Choi et al. prepared high-quality Ga2O3 thin films using a thermal ALD technique with GTIP (Ga(OiPr)3) and H2O as the Ga and O source, in which the GTIP precursor was heated to 120 °C in a stainless steel canister and H2O was maintained at 25 °C. When the GTIP precursor dose was increased up to 2.0 × 10−6 mol cm−2, the growth rate of the Ga2O3 films was saturated at a rather high rate of 2.5 Å per cycle at a substrate temperature of 150–250 °C.81 A high growth rate of ∼2.6 Å per cycle was even obtained at exposure to the GTIP pulse for 1 s, N2 purge for 15 s, and H2O pulse for 0.1 s.82
Ramachandran et al. used Ga(TMHD)3 (tris (2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-3,5-heptanedionato)gallium(III)) as the Ga source. The solid precursor had high volatility and thermal stability and was heated to 135 °C in the ALD process. The use of H2O, O3, and O2 plasma as the O source demonstrated that only O2 plasma could promote the deposition of Ga2O3 films at a growth rate of 0.1 Å per cycle at 100–400 °C. In-situ mass spectrometry studies demonstrated that the Ga(TMHD)3 molecules adsorbed non-dissociatively on the surface during the precursor pulse and non-volatile metal oxide and reaction products of CO and CO2 were taken into account in the subsequent O2 plasma pulse.83 Wei et al. reported the growth rate of 0.16 Å per cycle at 150 °C using the same Ga and O precursors.84
The liquid compound pentamethylcyclopentadienyl gallium (GaCp*) exhibited a high vapor pressure of about 6 Torr at 80 °C and thermal stability up to 250 °C. Mizutani et al. used GaCp* maintained at 80 °C as the Ga precursor and Ar as both the carrier and purging gas. Different oxidants, including H2O, O2, O2 plasma, H2O followed by O2 plasma, and H2O followed by O2, were tested as the O precursors. The highest growth rate of 0.6 Å per cycle was obtained for pulse times of 0.1, 3.0, and 50 s for GaCp*, H2O, and O2 plasma, respectively, in which H2O was used to desorb the ligand and O2 plasma then oxidized the surface Ga species. If O2 plasma was solely used as the O precursor, a much longer pulse time was required for the oxidation step. However, it was difficult to deposit the Ga2O3 films using only H2O, O2, or their combination as an oxidant.85
Recently, alkyl gallium compounds such as TMG (trimethylgallium) and TEG (triethylgallium) have been widely used as Ga source for the ALD deposition of Ga2O3 films. TMG is highly volatile and has a very high vapor pressure of 227 Torr at room temperature. Hence, a short pulse of TMG is enough to saturate the surface reaction quickly. In some reports, the TMG precursor was cooled down to 5 °C to avoid wastage in the ALD process.68,86 The vapor pressure of TEG is much lower than that of TMG; thus, a longer pulse time and room temperature are commonly used when TEG is applied as the Ga source. Comstock et al. reported the self-limiting growth of Ga2O3 films at the rate of ∼0.52 Å per cycle using TMG and O3 as the Ga and O sources at 200–375 °C. Essentially, TMG was adsorbed on Ga2O3 to form the Ga(CH3)2 surface species and ∼20% of the methyl ligands were released as CH4, ozone reacted with the methyl species to generate hydroxyl and formate surface groups, accompanied by the release of CH2O. The ALD growth of Ga2O3 films using TMG and H2O was not possible because the surface might be poisoned by methyl species after only a few cycles and could not be removed by H2O. H2O2, isopropanol, O2, and H2O/O2 mixtures were also not sufficiently reactive with the TMG-terminated surface even at 350 °C.60 In fact, Ga2O3 on Si substrates using TMG and H2O was detected instantly after the first cycle, but the thickness became saturated at 1 nm or so. Monolayer Ga2O3 film could be fabricated on GaAs or InGaAs substrate as a result of self-limiting growth after an initial incubation period of 30 cycles.87
Donmez et al. prepared Ga2O3 thin films by PEALD using TMG and O2 plasma as the Ga and O precursors, respectively. The deposition rate was constant at 0.53 Å per cycle at a growth temperature of 100–400 °C. The growth rate was saturated for O2 flow durations starting from 10 s and TMG pulse from a rather short time of 0.015 s at a precursor bottle temperature of 6 °C.61 Pansila et al. studied the adsorption and oxidation of TMG with plasma-excited humidified oxygen at room temperature. TMG was adsorbed dissociatively on two OH surface adsorption sites to form –O–Ga(CH3) and –O–CH3, and two dissociated-hydrogen atoms were recombined into H2. The CH3 ligands were oxidized by plasma-excited agents of O and OH to produce OH adsorption sites, and the hydrocarbons were oxidized to CO2 and H2O.88
Since the binding energies of the OO bond in O2 and O–H bonds in H2O are larger than that of the O–N bond in N2O, Huang et al. used N2O as the oxygen source to provide higher overpressure of oxygen radicals in the ALD process for Ga2O3. Single-crystal β-Ga2O3 films were fabricated on sapphire at 600 °C with a high pressure ratio of N2O/TEG;89 the film quality and surface morphology were improved at a larger N2O/TEG ratio, and the oxygen vacancies in Ga2O3 films were suppressed.90
3. Characterization techniques
The film thickness, growth rate, crystal structure, chemical composition, surface roughness, optical bandgap, and refractive index of Ga2O3 films can be detected via appropriate characterization techniques. The thickness of the Ga2O3 thin films via ALD deposition can be directly measured from the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images.60,66,91–93 For instance, the conformal film coverage of Ga2O3 on the patterned SiO2/Si substrate was revealed by the SEM images, and the film thickness was estimated to be 600–800 Å.59 The TEM images demonstrated that the thickness of the amorphous Ga2O3 thin films of 600 ALD-cycles was about 28 nm, indicating a growth rate of ∼0.47 Å per cycle.70 Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) and X-ray reflectivity (XRR) are common optical method to derive the thickness of thin films based on the fitting of the refractive index and analysis of optical reflection, respectively.61,65,66 For example, Lu's group stated that there was a pre-oxidation process on the Si substrate during the first several ALD cycles, and a thin layer of SiO2 was formed. Therefore, a three-layer model of the Ga2O3 film/SiO2 interfacial layer/Si substrate was constructed to fit the thickness data via SE and XRR. Though the XRR data showed a lower growth rate compared with the SE data, they both showed similar variation tendencies with elevated substrate temperature.62
The peak intensity in the X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the film-deposited substrate always becomes weaker along with the increase in the film thickness. Pansila et al. found that the Si 2p peak of the Si(100) substrate decreased with increasing ALD cycle numbers of the prepared Ga2O3 films. Then, the film thickness (d) was estimated using eqn (1). ISi2p = I0exp(−d/λSi_Ga)(1)ISi2p and I0 are the photoelectron intensity of the Si 2p peak measured from the Ga2O3-deposited Si substrate and from the bare Si substrate, respectively. λSi_Ga was the escape depth of the Si 2p photoelectron in Ga2O3 that was assumed to be 2.5 nm. The growth rate was calculated to be 0.055 nm per cycle using this method.88 Ding's group determined the thickness (d) of the Ga2O3 films on the GaN substrate using angle-resolved XPS measurement based on eqn (2) given below. ln(1 + R/R0) = d/λ0·sinθ,(2)R is the areal ratio of the Ga–O component to the Ga–N component under the Ga 3d core-level spectra at different photoelectron collecting angles (θ). R0 is related to the bulk material properties of Ga2O3 and GaN, and λ0 is the electron inelastic mean free path of Ga2O3.63
Unlike the above thickness measurement methods, in situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) can be used to estimate the growth rate of ALD-deposited Ga2O3 films based on density measurement. Comstock and coworkers recorded the mass versus time by QCM that was highly linear at 31 ng per cm2 per cycle for alternating TMGa–O3 exposures at a deposition temperature of 350 °C. Assuming the β-Ga2O3 bulk density of 5.88 g cm−3, this mass gain corresponded to a growth rate of 0.53 Å per cycle, which was similar to the growth rate of 0.52 Å per cycle measured by ellipsometry.60 For ALD-deposited Ga2O3 layers at a substrate temperature of 60–160 °C, O′Donoghue et al. reported a growth rate of 2.5 Å per cycle according to QCM data, whereas an average of 1.5 Å per cycle was obtained according to SE, XRR, or RBS (Rutherford backscattering spectrometry). The overestimated growth rate by QCM measurement was ascribed to the difference between the utilized bulk density of β-Ga2O3 and the actual density of the fabricated Ga2O3 layers.78
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement can identify the dominant crystal planes for ALD-deposited Ga2O3 films and then the single-crystalline, polycrystalline, or amorphous characteristics could be distinguished.62,76 For instance, no XRD peaks were identified in Ga2O3 films prepared using Ga2(NMe2)6 and O2 plasma, except for the peak of the Si(100) substrate. However, the XRD peaks emerged at 2θ = 18.9°, 30.1°, 31.7°, and 45.8° if the samples were annealed at 1000 °C, corresponding to β-Ga2O3.78 Huang et al. achieved single-crystalline β-Ga2O3 on the sapphire substrate using TEG and N2O as the Ga and O sources at 600 °C, which was proved by the (−201), (−402), and (−603) prefer-oriented XRD peaks at 18.98°, 38.52°, and 59.19°, respectively. However, the single crystalline β-Ga2O3 was transformed into polycrystalline form upon irradiation by the gamma ray since the crystal planes of (−401), (−111), and (−712) appeared at 30.46°, 33.46°, and 64.64°, respectively.89 The crystal phases of ALD-grown Ga2O3 films can also be identified by the XRD spectrum.65,68 Roberts et al. prepared α-Ga2O3 on sapphire using TEG and O2 plasma, for which the XRD peak at 40.0483° corresponds to the α-Ga2O3 (0006) reflection, and additional weak peaks corresponding to β-Ga2O3(3–11), ε-Ga2O3(0004), and ε-Ga2O3(21–31) were distinguished.94
The crystalline quality of ALD-deposited Ga2O3 films could be assessed by measuring the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of the rocking curve ω scans taken on symmetric and skew-symmetric reflections.69,89,90 The rocking curve on the (0006) reflection had a FWHM of 22 arcsec, indicating excellent film quality of α-Ga2O3. The rocking curve on the (10–14) reflection was much broader with an FWHM of 5469 arcsec, indicating the twisting of the α-Ga2O3 crystals around the [0001] direction.94 The average grain size (d) in Ga2O3 films can be evaluated from the XRD results according the Scherrer formula.94,95 d = 0.9λ/(ΔθBcosθB)(3)λ is the wavelength of X-ray beam, ΔθB is the FWHM obtained from the XRD peaks, and θB is the Bragg's angle. Based on the calculation, Altuntas et al. found that the average grain size of ALD β-Ga2O3 films increased rapidly from 0.8 nm to 9.1 nm with elevated annealing temperature.92 The orientation relationship between epitaxial Ga2O3 films and the deposition substrate can be revealed by XRD measurement.69 Borujeny et al. synthesized a mixture of α-Ga2O3 and β-Ga2O3 on sapphire using TEG and O2 plasma. No other peaks except (−201), (−402), and (−603) planes of β-Ga2O3 indicated strong preferential orientation of β-Ga2O3(−201)//α-Al2O3(006). Meanwhile, the only peak from the metastable α-Ga2O3(006) peak at 2θ = 40.30° indicates the strong preferential orientation of α-Ga2O3(006)//α-Al2O3(006). Furthermore, out-of-plane XRD2 (2D XRD) coupled scans were also helpful to examine the preferred orientation of the Ga2O3 phases.65
The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) accompanied by TEM can be carried out to estimate the crystallographic information of ALD-deposited Ga2O3 thin films.93,96 The electron diffraction pattern with a hollow ring but no spot-like features indicated the amorphous structure of the as-deposited Ga2O3 film.85 Ilhom et al. performed fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis, which displayed ring-like diffraction features corresponding to the polycrystalline β-phase Ga2O3.66 High resolution TEM and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) are direct methods to achieve the crystal morphology and lattice constant of ALD-deposited Ga2O3 films.66,67,69 The as-grown Ga2O3 films deposited on GaN exhibited the ordered arrangement of atoms in a certain level, as shown in the TEM images. The FFT patterns demonstrated the crystallization of low temperature (∼250 °C) growth of the Ga2O3 film with an interplanar distance of 4.63 Å corresponding to the (−201) face of β-Ga2O3.63 The TEM and STEM measurements can also illustrate the matched lattice structures of the Ga2O3 film and the growth substrate.68,69 Borujeny et al. found that several monolayers near the substrate were α-Ga2O3 and completely coherent with the substrate, with the epitaxial relationship of α-Ga2O3 (006)//α-Al2O3 (006). If the Ga2O3 film thickness was further increased, either more α-Ga2O3 (006) planes or highly oriented β-Ga2O3 (−201) planes emerged.65
Numerous methods can be used to analyze the elemental composition in ALD-deposited Ga2O3 films.60,73,78,81,85,97 The elemental depth profiles via high-resolution RBS exhibited that the Ga2O3 thin film using GaCp* as the Ga source had a stoichiometric O/Ga composition of 1.5, and carbon was detected only on the surface.85 The depth profiles of Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) demonstrated that the Ga2O3 film deposited by PEALD using [(CH3)2GaNH2]3 and O2 plasma was stoichiometric and showed excellent depth homogeneity, while no impurities including carbon could be detected.59 Time-of-flight elastic recoil detection analysis (TOF-ERDA) showed that the Ga2O3 films prepared using Ga2(NMe2)6 and H2O had a Ga/O ratio of 0.67 and low impurity content. Depth profiling revealed that all the films were compositionally uniform down to the substrate level.76 Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOFSIMS) demonstrated that the H and OH secondary ions at the interfaces between Ga2O3 and Si or GaN substrate were increased after introducing in situ NH3 plasma.63 Color-assigned energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental analyses accompanied by cross-sectional high-resolution STEM demonstrated a strong and sharp contrast of Ga over the Ga2O3 layer, while the O signal was slightly extended into the native oxide layer, which confirmed the presence of the SiO2 layer. The C signal was considerably weak within the Ga2O3 layer, which agreed well with the XPS results.66
The chemical composition and bonding state of ALD-deposited Ga2O3 films are commonly studied by XPS. The XPS survey spectra of Ga2O3 films were dominated by gallium (Ga 3d, Ga 3p, Ga 3s, Ga 2p3/2, Ga 2p1/2), oxygen (O 1s, O 2s), and carbon (C 1s, as introduced) along with the respective Auger peaks from gallium (Ga LMM) and oxygen (OKVL, OKVV). By analyzing the relative area of the elements in the films, the percentage of average atomic composition of Ga, O, and C can be calculated.69,71 For instance, the Ga/O ratio was about 0.56 in the as-deposited films, which is characteristic of the oxygen-rich feature. It is different from the RBS value since XPS was a more surface sensitive characterization method.78 The XPS peaks can always be fitted to several subpeaks to achieve atomic bonding information.62 The O 1s peak of Ga2O3 films could be fitted into three constituents—lattice oxide in Ga2O3 (530.7 eV), oxygen attached onto organic carbonyl groups (533.2 eV), and oxide of hydroxyl groups (532.0 eV).78 Mahmoodinezhad et al. reported that the O 1s XPS spectra of Ga2O3 films could be fitted into four sub-peaks. Except for Ga–O, O–H, and O–C peaks, one O 1s satellite peak emerged at 529.5 ± 0.2 eV. The Ga 3d spectra were also fitted into four subpeaks, which were attributed to Ga–O bonding, Ga–OH species, carbonates, and O 2s core level, respectively.98 The oxygen vacancies in Ga2O3 films can also be revealed by the fitted XPS peaks.66,70 Huang et al. deconvoluted the O 1s peak into two peaks; the dominant peak at 531.2 eV was attributed to the Ga–O bonds and the other peak at 532.5 eV corresponds to the oxygen vacancies in the β-Ga2O3 films. The area under the peak at 532.5 eV was proportional to the percentage of oxygen vacancies in β-Ga2O3.89
The surface morphologies of Ga2O3 films are commonly investigated and evaluated through atomic force microscopy (AFM).67,71 For example, AFM clearly showed the step flow of Ga2O3 on GaN following the features of the GaN wafer. As listed in Table 1, the surface roughness of the Ga2O3 films on Si and GaN substrates was 0.12 and 0.20 nm, respectively.63 Borujeny et al. found that Ra, which represents the mean absolute profile, was slightly smaller than Rq, which was more sensitive to peaks and valleys due to the squaring of the amplitude in its calculation. The skewness parameter as a measure of the degree of bias of the roughness shape and the kurtosis value as a measure of the population of sharp features in the surface profile could also be extracted from the AFM measurements.65 X-ray reflectivity (XRR) is another method to measure the surface roughness of ALD-grown Ga2O3 films.83 The roughness values of Ga2O3 films at substrate temperatures of 100, 150, 200, and 250 °C were 0.449, 0.451, 0.481, and 0.386 nm, respectively. It was obvious that the AFM and XRR results exhibited the same variation tendency, while the XRR values were higher than the AFM values.62
The optical bandgap of Ga2O3 films is commonly measured by ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2, Lu's group found that the as-deposited Ga2O3 thin films on glass substrate exhibited excellent optical transmission in the visible wavelength region of 300–800 nm (nearly 100%). However, in the range of 200–300 nm, it showed poor transparency with a transmittance of 50% for 15 nm Ga2O3 films. Since Ga2O3 is a quasi-direct bandgap semiconductor, the relationship between the absorption coefficient (α) and the optical bandgap (Eg) was described as follows. α(hν) ∝ (hν − Eg)1/2(4) α ∝ −lnT/d(5)where hν is the photon energy, d represents the film thickness, and T is the transmittance. Then, the optical bandgap could be obtained from the plot of the relative absorption coefficient [α(hν)]2 against the photon energy by extrapolating the linear part of the curve to zero.62 As listed in Table 1, most related studies achieved the optical bandgaps of Ga2O3 films using the same calculation equation.60,68,71,74,83,86,93

Spectroscopic ellipsometry is usually carried out to measure the refractive index of Ga2O3 films. The change in the polarization of light upon reflection from a sample is described by an amplitude ratio (Ψ) and a phase difference (Δ) for a range of photon wavelengths. From this data, the refractive index (n) of the Ga2O3 film can be deduced through a fitting-based analysis with a Cauchy model, n(λ) = A + B/λ2 + C/λ4(6)where A, B, and C are coefficients that can be deduced by fitting the formula at given wavelengths of materials and λ is the wavelength. As shown in Table 1, Ramachandran et al. fitted the A, B, and C values of 1.805, 0.013, and 0.000442, respectively, and a refractive index of 1.84 at a wavelength of 632.8 nm.83 Comstock et al. achieved the refractive index of 1.88 at 589 nm for the as-deposited Ga2O3 films with the A, B, and C values of 1.844, 0.01249, and 0.000463, respectively.60 Hiller et al. reported that the refractive indexes at 633 nm ranged from 1.832 for Ga2O3 films deposited by PEALD at a growth temperature of 75–150 °C to 1.871 for Ga2O3 films deposited by thermal ALD at 250–350 °C.97
4. Factors moderating film growth
Growth rate is an important parameter for ALD film growth as it decides the film deposition time. Due to the layer by layer growth mode, the growth rate of ALD deposition is commonly defined by growth per cycle (GPC), which is calculated by dividing the film thickness by the number of deposition cycles. The film thickness can be directly measured by cross-sectional images or calculated by optical methods. As listed in Table 1, the highest GPC of Ga2O3 films by ALD is 2.5 Å per cycle and the lowest one is 0.1 Å per cycle.81,83 Indeed, the GPC of Ga2O3 films depends on not only the precursors used but also the substrate temperature, pulse time, and surface state.
4.1. Substrate temperature
For the self-limited growth mode, ALD always exhibits a constant growth rate in a substrate temperature range, which is referred to as the “ALD window”. As listed in Table 1, a growth rate of ∼1.5 Å per cycle was reported using DMGIP and H2O as the Ga and O source, respectively, in the ALD window of 300–325 °C.79 Choi et al. prepared Ga2O3 films using GTIP and H2O as the precursors at a growth rate of 0.25 nm per cycle in the ALD window of 150–250 °C.81 Compared with thermal ALD, PEALD always possesses a wider and lower ALD window due to more energetic reaction ions. For example, an apparent ALD window of 100–400 °C with a deposition rate of 0.53 Å per cycle was observed using TMG and O2 plasma as the sources.61 Borujeny and coworkers prepared Ga2O3 films using TEG and O2 plasma with an overall growth rate of 0.55 ± 0.02 Å per cycle in the temperature range of 125–352 °C.65 Wheeler et al. reported a growth rate of 0.55 Å per cycle in the ALD window of 265–475 °C, although the phase of Ga2O3 films depended on the temperature.69
The growth rate at a lower temperature is higher than that in the ALD window because of the condensation of the Ga precursor onto the substrate or the incomplete removal of the reaction byproducts. For instance, Lu's group prepared Ga2O3 films at a growth rate of 0.07 nm per cycle using TMG and O2 plasma in the ALD window of 100–250 °C, but 0.12 nm per cycle at 80 °C.62 A growth rate of 0.1 Å per cycle was obtained using Ga(TMHD)3 as the Ga precursor within a ALD window of 100–400 °C, but 0.13 Å per cycle at a temperature below 100 °C.83 On the other hand, the growth rate seems lower at a higher temperature because of the thermal decomposition of the Ga precursor. Comstock et al. fabricated Ga2O3 films using TMG and O3 at a lower growth rate if the temperature exceeded the ALD window of 200–375 °C.60 Ga2(NMe2)6 and H2O were combined to deposit Ga2O3 films with a growth rate of 1.0 Å per cycle at 170–250 °C, but 1.1 and 0.89 Å per cycle at 150 °C and 275 °C, respectively. In addition, films deposited at 275 °C displayed an opaque gray discoloration at the edges of the substrate, which suggested either gas phase or surface decomposition of Ga2(NMe2)6.76
4.2. Pulse process
The saturation of the substrate surface within each pulse is crucial to ALD; thus, the pulse time should be long enough to complete the surface reaction and avoid reactant mixing. For example, self-limiting behavior was found for pulse length above 1 s and 2 s for the cases of Ga2(NMe2)6 and O2 plasma, respectively.78 A pulse time of 4 s for the Ga(TMHD)3 precursor and 2 s for O2 plasma were sufficient to reach saturated growth of Ga2O3 films.83 Shih et al. prepared Ga2O3 films on AlGaN using TEG and O2 plasma as Ga and O precursors at the deposition temperature of 250 °C. The growth rate increased initially with increasing TEG dose, but then remained at 0.062 nm per cycle when the TEG pulse time was longer than 0.1 s.71 Kröncke et al. found that 3 s was the lower limit for O2 plasma pulse, and the growth rate was greatly reduced at a shorter time and limited by the low flux of the oxygen species.99 Ding's group found that 0.1 s TMG was enough to reach saturation, and the growth rate was almost independent on the pulse duration of 0.1 to 0.2 s. The growth rate increased with O2 plasma duration and was saturated at the pulse time of 18 s.63 Donmez et al. reported that 0.015 s duration was enough for TMG dose and 10 s for O2 duration; five seconds of Ar flow was sufficient for complete the purging of excess precursors and gaseous byproducts.61 As shown in Fig. 3, the growth rate of the Ga2O3 film was saturated with TMG exposure time longer than 1.5 s and O3 exposure time longer than 4 s. Thus, the sequence steps were composed of TMG pulse (1.5 s)/N2 purge (5 s)/O3 pulse (4 s)/N2 purge (5 s), corresponding to the growth rate of 0.58 Å per cycle.68

Lu’ s group reported that the growth rate of Ga2O3 films increased gradually with increasing O2 plasma time and reached a maximum value of 0.064 nm per cycle at 7.0 s. However, the GPC value decreased slightly at the plasma pulse time of 11.0 s because of the etching effect of the near-field plasma.62 Due to the slower ozone reactions at lower substrate temperature, the growth rate of Ga2O3 using O3 was saturated at 350 °C for 3 s exposure, but 12 s exposure was needed at 250 °C.60 Hiller et al. found that the growth rate of thermal ALD of Ga2O3 was saturated for O3 exposure of 18 s at 250 °C but 9 s at 300 °C. 20 ms was enough for TMG pulse length and 1 s was sufficient for both TMG and O3 purge steps. On the other hand, the growth rate of ∼0.5 Å per cycle for O2 plasma pulse length of 1 s and ∼0.7 Å per cycle for that longer than 2 s were investigated for PEALD Ga2O3 films. TMG pulse length of 20 ms was also used and the O2 plasma purge step was set to 4 s.97
4.3. Surface state
The surface state of the substrate is important for the deposition of Ga2O3via ALD. Suitable plasma treatment might modify the surface bonding states and increase the reactive sites on the substrate. Ding's group performed in situ NH3 plasma pretreatment on the substrate, resulting in higher concentration of OH on the surface, and the growth rate of Ga2O3 films was increased from 0.44 to 0.53 Å per cycle on Si(100) and from 0.24 to 0.46 Å per cycle on the GaN wafer.63 Ilhom et al. performed in situ Ar plasma annealing at the end of each ALD cycle and analyzed the chemisorption and ligand exchange by in situ ellipsometry. The elevated step heights during the TEG pulses indicated more efficient adsorption of precursors because in situ Ar plasma annealing promoted ligand desorption and more nucleation sites. Compared to the growth rate of 0.77 Å per cycle, it was significantly increased up to 0.84 and 1.03 Å per cycle upon in situ Ar plasma annealing at radio-frequency powers of 50 and 250 W, respectively.66
5. Properties of films
5.1. Crystal structure
Commonly, Ga2O3 possesses α, β, γ, δ, ε, and κ phases. The monoclinic β phase belonging to the space group C2/m is the only thermodynamically stable phase. Single-crystal α-Ga2O3 thin films can be grown without any rotational domains on sapphire substrate. The γ phase is isostructural to Al2MgO4 with a cubic structure. Both ε (pseudo hexagonal) and κ (orthorhombic) phases are polar and suitable to be applied to high-frequency electronic devices due to higher charge density and mobility.65 The crystallite characteristics of Ga2O3 films can be illustrated by XRD in detail, and the corresponding atomic structure and epitaxial relationship with the growth substrate can be directly measured by TEM or STEM.
The vast majority of ALD-grown Ga2O3 films are amorphous, which require high-temperature thermal annealing process to achieve crystallization. The annealing temperature plays an important role in determining the crystal structures of Ga2O3 thin films. Generally, the crystallinity of Ga2O3 thin films could be improved with elevated annealing temperature. As shown in Fig. 4(a), Shan et al. found that the as-deposited and the 500 °C-annealed Ga2O3 films were amorphous and they were crystallized into the β-phase Ga2O3 with a preferred (400) orientation at 700 °C, and the crystallization was enhanced with elevated annealing temperature; moreover, (002) and (−202) orientations also appeared.59 When ALD Ga2O3 films were annealed under N2 atmosphere, crystallization started at 600 °C and crystallinity increased with elevated annealing temperature.61 Ramachandran et al. found that the amorphous films were transformed into polycrystalline β-Ga2O3 on annealing under an He atmosphere, and the crystallization started at 630 °C, as revealed by the intensification of the XRD peaks.83 Altuntas et al. reported the crystallization temperature of 600 °C for Ga2O3 films. The average crystallite size value increased rapidly from 0.8 nm to 9.1 nm and the FWHM values for the most intense peak decreased, which was an evidence of improvement of the crystal quality with increasing annealing temperatures.92

The annealing atmosphere and annealing time also affect the crystal structure of ALD Ga2O3 films. Moloney et al. found that the crystallinity of Ga2O3 films could be enhanced upon annealing at 400 °C under different atmospheres such as air, argon, oxygen, and forming gas (3% H2 and 97% N2), especially for the samples annealed in oxygen atmosphere.67 As shown in Fig. 4(b), upon annealing at 1000 °C for 30 min, the XRD peaks at 38.4° and 44.5° of the as-deposited metastable Ga2O3 were reduced, but the peaks at 19.0°, 38.9° and 59.2° corresponding to the (−201), (−402), and (−603) planes of β-Ga2O3 emerged. The peaks at 38.4° and 44.5° disappeared, and the (−201) preferred orientation of the β-Ga2O3 film was obtained after annealing at 1000 °C for 1 h and 2 h. The results demonstrated that high-temperature annealing pushed metastable Ga2O3 to the stable β-Ga2O3 by supplying enough energy, and the crystallinity was improved with prolonged annealing time.100 The crystallization of PEALD Ga2O3 films occurred when annealed at 500–600 °C for 2 h or undergoing rapid thermal annealing (RTA) at 800 °C for 2 min.72 Baji et al. found that the amorphous Ga2O3 films could be transformed into β-Ga2O3 crystallites after undergoing annealing in nitrogen or oxygen atmosphere at 900 °C for 5 min. However, the crystallite size was too small and some amorphous domains also remained in the film. When the annealing time was prolonged to 3 h, some minor XRD peaks were seen for the Ga2O3 samples annealed in nitrogen, whereas crystalline β-Ga2O3 was clearly visible for the samples annealed in oxygen atmosphere.77
Although the Ga2O3 films via ALD are always amorphous on Si substrate, the ε-, α-Ga2O3, or even the stable β-Ga2O3 can be achieved using suitable growth parameters on sapphire substrate. The different crystalline characteristics at the same growth temperature should ascribe that the lattice matching between Ga2O3 and sapphire is better than that between Ga2O3 and Si. However, the detailed thermodynamic and kinetic processes should be clarified with further studies. Boschi et al. prepared ε-Ga2O3 films on sapphire by ALD at 550 °C using TMG and H2O as the sources.101 Roberts et al. demonstrated that (0001)-oriented α-Ga2O3 columns could be deposited on the sapphire substrate by ALD at 250 °C with TEG and O2 plasma. Some inclusions, most likely of the ε phase, were also observed primarily at the tip of the columns and the amorphous phase was found to be located near to the surface and between the α-Ga2O3 columns.94 α-Ga2O3 was also achieved on the sapphire at 250 °C using TMG and O3, which was indicated by the single peak at 40° in the XRD spectrum.68 The phases of Ga2O3 films is affected by the substrate temperature on the sapphire substrate. Lee et al. achieved amorphous Ga2O3 film on sapphire at 200 °C, but for α-phase Ga2O3 at 225–250 °C and phase transformation from the α- to the β-phase at 300 °C. The β-Ga2O3 became more predominant than α-Ga2O3 at 329 °C.86 Roberts et al. found that amorphous Ga2O3 films occurred on c-plane sapphire at 120–150 °C. α-Ga2O3 appeared at 200 °C and the crystallization was improved with increasing growth temperature from 200 to 300 °C. At 350 °C or above, α-Ga2O3 would be reduced, and ε-Ga2O3(0004), ε-Ga2O3(21−11), or β-Ga2O3(31−1) increased.102 Borujeny et al. obtained a mixture of α- and β-Ga2O3 on sapphire at 190–352 °C, but not on Si or glass.65 Wheeler et al. obtained Ga2O3 films of mixed α, β, and ε phases with poor crystallinity at temperature below 295 °C. A temperature slightly higher than 295 °C could promote the growth of high-quality and single-phase α-Ga2O3 films using the pure O2 plasma flow of 40 sccm and a pressure of 8 mTorr during the plasma step, and single-phase β-Ga2O3 films were deposited at 400 °C.69
Ilhom et al. prepared amorphous Ga2O3 films at 200 °C irrespective of the deposition plasma power. However, in situ Ar annealing at the end of each ALD cycle promoted the formation of polycrystalline β-Ga2O3, irrespective of whether on Si, sapphire, or amorphous glass at the same deposition temperature. The crystallization of Ga2O3 films at low substrate temperature could be ascribed to two mechanisms: (i) “surface crystallization”, in which the surface adatoms would gain extra energy from the plasma-generated ions and promote crystallization; (ii) “surface heating”, during which the absorbed energy from the Ar plasma increased the surface temperature within a few monolayers.66
The flow and composition of the oxygen source and pressure in ALD process also affect the crystal quality and phase in Ga2O3 films. Lee et al. found that the α-phase was dominantly formed in the Ga2O3 film grown on sapphire at 300 °C. As the ALD process pressure was increased from 1.1 to 1.4 Torr, the pumping efficiency decreased and the elimination of excess physisorbed species was insufficient. The remained precursor molecules or byproduct could screen the adsorption sites for the Ga precursor, inhibiting the epitaxial growth of α-Ga2O3 on the sapphire substrate, thus resulting in the growth of stable β-Ga2O3.86 Boris et al. found that the phase of Ga2O3 films could be altered by increasing the O2 flow from 5 to 100 sccm at 350 °C and with a chamber pressure of 8 mTorr. The β-phase could be isolated at O2 flows below 10 sccm, while the α-phase was obtained with flows of 40–80 sccm. As the plasma potential and ion flux varied only weakly with the O2 flow, the phase selection of Ga2O3 films should be ascribed to the atomic O density, which varied strongly with flow. Furthermore, at the same total flow, the emission ratio of excited atomic O to molecular O2 was 3× higher for pure O2 than that for Ar/O2 mixtures. As a result, changing the operating gas from pure O2 to dilute Ar/O2 resulted in a mixed phase of Ga2O3.64
As shown in Fig. 5, Wheeler et al. modulated the phases of Ga2O3 films via gas composition, oxygen flow, and pressure in the ALD process. Firstly, pure α-Ga2O3 film was produced at a low pressure of 8 mTorr, while a mixed β- and ε-Ga2O3 film was prepared at a higher pressure of 80 mTorr, which was ascribed to the different plasma species. A high ion flux of 1.5 × 1015 cm−2 s−1 was measured for the pressure of 8 mTorr condition and coupled with a higher plasma potential of 46 V, while the ion flux was 5× lower with a significantly reduced plasma potential of 32 V for a pressure of 80 mTorr. Secondly, Ar-diluted O2 gas produced defective polycrystalline Ga2O3 films with mixed β and ε phase, but pure O2 gas resulted in a high-quality pure α phase. The improved crystallinity and stabilization of the α phase could be ascribed to a synergistic effect of the increased atomic oxygen density and increased ion energy. Thirdly, single β phase was deposited at extremely low flows of oxygen (<10 sccm), mixed β and α phases were prepared at the flow of 10–40 sccm, and a pure metastable α phase film was produced at the flow of 40–60 sccm. At the flows of >60 sccm, the films became more defective with β, α, and ε phases. The OES spectra (optical emission spectra) were applied to explain the mechanism. A large Ar signal was detected for the lowest flow of O2 and the amount of Ar, which had a direct correlation with the β phase component, was reduced with increasing oxygen flow. Increasing the oxygen flow above 40 sccm led to decreased O*/O2* emission ratio; thus, α-Ga2O3 was stabilized with the maximum atomic oxygen species.69

5.2. Chemical composition
Chemical composition is important for ALD-deposited films, for example, the stoichiometry of Ga and O determines the semiconducting or insulating nature of Ga2O3. Various test methods, especially XPS, can be used to achieve the atomic ratio and bonding state of Ga2O3 films. Carbon is the dominant impurity in Ga2O3 films and can be eliminated through sputtering. The substrate temperature affects the elemental composition slightly, while the annealing temperature can change the O content in Ga2O3 films.
Carbon can act as a shallow donor in Ga2O3 films; thus, it is important to suppress the doping of carbon for high-quality semiconductors. Sputtering is commonly used to remove the carbon in Ga2O3 thin film. For instance, the high-resolution C 1s peak showed that there was no indication of residual carbon after Ar sputtering for 45 s.69 The C 1s signal could be assigned to aliphatic and adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV, the aliphatic carbon related to oxygen at 286.8 eV and the carbon associated with double bonds and oxygen such as carboxylic acid signal at 289.1 eV. After sputtering, the signal at 284.8 eV decreased below the atomic percentage detection limit, highlighting that the carbon in the films was mainly of an adventitious nature.78 As shown in Fig. 6, Lu's group reported that the C 1s signal of Ga2O3 films disappeared after 20 s of Ar+ sputtering. The weakest subpeak of O 1s was attributed to the oxygen in organic carbonyl groups (CO2) absorbed on the surface, and also disappeared after Ar+ sputtering.62 For the as-deposited Ga2O3 films, the C 1s peak at 285–286 eV was attributed to hydrocarbon species with C–H or C–C bonds, while the peak at ∼290 eV was attributed to oxidized carbonaceous species with C–O–C or O–CO bonds, both of which disappeared after sputtering for 15 min.99

The sputtering process can also affect the Ga/O ratio in Ga2O3 films. The Ga/O ratio was increased from 0.71 to 0.76 after Ar+ sputtering on the Ga2O3 surface, which could be ascribed to oxygen vacancies.62 Ilhom et al. considered that the sputtering processes typically resulted in preferential etching of the lighter element (O in the Ga2O3), leading to the accumulation of the heavier element on the surface (metallic Ga). The O/Ga ratio of the unsputtered sample (∼1.90) dropped to ∼1.55 after about two Ar sputtering cycles using a 500 eV beam, while the carbon content dropped from 16.8% to 9.5%. The C concentration dropped further after sputtering with a 1 keV beam, but the O/Ga ratio was already negatively affected where it dropped to ∼1.31.66
The substrate temperature affects the elemental decomposition of ALD Ga2O3 films slightly. The Ga2O3 film prepared at 250 °C had Ga, O, and C concentrations of 36%, 51.8%, and 12.2%, respectively, and the elemental compositions were almost independent of the temperature within the ALD window of 100–400 °C.61 The stoichiometry of O/Ga was ∼1.3 for the Ga2O3 film deposited in a temperature window of 250–400 °C.63 Mahmoodinezhad et al. reported that the Ga 3d components in Ga2O3 films remained constant at 80–200 °C and just the hydroxide contribution was slightly higher at 80 °C owing to the lower thermal stability of the hydroxide species.98
The annealing process may change the concentration of oxygen vacancy in ALD-deposited Ga2O3 films. For instance, Zhou et al. reported that the O 1s XPS spectrum of Ga2O3 films could be deconvoluted into two components, one peak (OI) at 530.5 eV from O–Ga bonds and another (OII) at 531.2 eV from the O2− ions in the oxygen-deficient regions. The OII/(OI + OII) ratios were 46%, 41%, 39%, 38%, and 35% for the as-grown Ga2O3 film and 350 °C, 450 °C, 500 °C, and 550 °C annealed Ga2O3 films in oxygen atmosphere, respectively, i.e., the oxygen vacancy concentration decreased with increasing annealing temperature. However, the O 1s XPS spectrum of Ga2O3 films changed little after annealing in Ar atmosphere.91 Chu et al. also fitted the O 1s peak of Ga2O3 films by two bands of the Ga–O bonds and oxygen vacancy. The oxygen vacancy in the Ga2O3 films was decreased after annealing treatment in oxygen environment, and the peak ratios of Ga–O bonds to the oxygen vacancy were calculated to be 5.92, 7.85, 12.71, and 10.07 for the as-grown Ga2O3 films and those annealed at 700, 800, and 900 °C, respectively.103 Lee et al. found that the Ga 2p spectra changed negligibly after annealing in air containing oxygen at 500 °C, indicating that the as-grown Ga2O3 film was fully oxidized owing to the highly oxidative ozone, which was used as the oxygen source in the ALD process.68
5.3. Surface morphology
Due to the layer by layer growth mode, the ALD-deposited Ga2O3 films always exhibit smooth surface morphology. AFM is the most common method to characterize the surface topographies. The root mean-square (RMS) surface roughness is closely linked with the crystalline state of the Ga2O3 thin film, which is commonly dependent on the substrate temperature and annealing process.
The substrate temperature seems to have little influence on the surface roughness of amorphous Ga2O3 films. Liu et al. found that the surfaces of Ga2O3 films deposited at 50–250 °C were very smooth, and the surface roughness changed within 1 or 2 atoms.75 Choi et al. found that the 40 nm Ga2O3 films prepared with GTIP and H2O had smooth surfaces, independent of the deposition temperature. The surface roughness of the films deposited at 150, 200, and 250 °C was 3.35, 4.11, and 3.98 Å, respectively.81 The as-deposited Ga2O3 films at different substrate temperatures were smooth with the RMS surface roughness of 0.134–0.161 nm, except at 80 °C. The Ga2O3 films deposited at 80 °C showed a severe “Island” growth, which was attributed to the inadequate decomposition and condensation of Ga precursors.62
Commonly, the surface roughness is related to the crystalline state of Ga2O3 thin films. Borujeny et al. compared the surface roughness of Ga2O3 films deposited at 125–352 °C. The crystalline film grown at 277 °C consisted of highly oriented α- and β-Ga2O3 phases and was hence the roughest among all the films.65 At 150 °C and below, the RMS roughness of the amorphous Ga2O3 films was below 0.5 nm, indicating a very uniform and conformal deposition. A slight increase in roughness occurred for the Ga2O3 films deposited at 200–350 °C due to the formation of the α phase. Above 350 °C, the surface roughness was increased by an order of magnitude up to 3 nm at 450 °C due to multiple phases of α-, β-, and ε-Ga2O3.102 Wheeler et al. fabricated β-, α-, and ε-Ga2O3 films. As shown in Fig. 7, the β-Ga2O3 films grown under optimized conditions possessed a smooth surface with a roughness of 0.38 nm. The α-Ga2O3 surface was also extremely smooth. The roughness of the α-Ga2O3 film and sapphire substrate was 0.18 and 0.11 nm, respectively. The ε-Ga2O3 film was very granular, suggesting island growth, with an RMS roughness of 1.02 nm.69

The annealing process commonly has an influence on the crystal states of ALD-deposited Ga2O3 films and then changes the surface roughness. Shan et al. found that the RMS roughness of amorphous Ga2O3 films could be reduced from 4.6 Å to 4.1 Å after annealing at 500 °C. However, when the temperature was elevated up to 700 °C, crystallization occurred and the RMS value was increased to 5.1 Å.59 Similarly, the RMS roughness of Ga2O3 films was increased from 0.16 to 0.37 nm after annealing at 900 °C for 30 min.61 O′Donoghue et al. found that the as-deposited Ga2O3 thin films were smooth with an RMS roughness of 0.31–0.44 nm, but were increased up to 0.77 nm after annealing.78 Ramachandran et al. found that the amorphous Ga2O3 film grown at 200 °C was very smooth, but the RMS roughness was slightly increased up to 3 Å after annealing at 900 °C.83 Baji et al. reported that the roughness of Ga2O3 films increased after annealing at 900 °C. The Ga2O3 layers annealed for 5 min had small grains on the surface, but 3 h annealing led to 100–200 nm angular grains.77 Shi et al. reported that prolonging the annealing times could promote film crystallization and then improve the surface morphology of nanocrystalline Ga2O3 films. The RMS values of Ga2O3 films annealed at 1000 °C for 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h were 0.316, 0.247, and 0.235 nm, respectively.100
5.4. Optical properties
Due to the ultrawide bandgap, Ga2O3 has potential applications in power electronics and solar-blind photodetectors. The optical transmittance is commonly measured to evaluate the optical bandgap of ALD Ga2O3 thin films. The optical bandgap is always related to the crystal phase and crystal quality, and is thus affected by the substrate temperature and annealing process.
For the amorphous Ga2O3 films, the substrate temperature seems to have little influence on the values of optical bandgap. All the Ga2O3 films deposited on a glass substrate at 150–250 °C showed outstanding optical transmission (over 90% in visible light range) and no significant changes in the optical bandgap.81 Mahmoodinezhad et al. found that the bandgap of amorphous Ga2O3 films slightly decreased with increasing substrate temperature from 80 to 200 °C, but the deviation was only in the range of ∼100 meV.98 The bandgap of Ga2O3 depends on its crystal structure as α-Ga2O3 has a larger bandgap of ∼5.2 eV, while β-Ga2O3 has a smaller bandgap of 4.6–4.9 eV. Besides, the localized electronic states induced by defects affect the optical bandgap significantly. Borujeny et al. found that the Ga2O3 films on sapphire started to crystallize into the α- and β- phases at 190 °C; thus, the films deposited at 125 °C and 190 °C had smaller optical bandgap than that of bulk Ga2O3. The Ga2O3 film grown at 277 °C had an α-phase of high crystalline quality and thus larger optical bandgap. At temperature above 277 °C, the optical bandgap of Ga2O3 films was reduced owing to a smaller amount of α-phase and more defects.65 Wheeler et al. reported a bandgap of 5.0 eV of α-Ga2O3, which was higher than the bandgap of 4.8 eV for β-Ga2O3 and ε-Ga2O3 films.69 Roberts et al. observed an optical bandgap of 5.05 eV for the amorphous Ga2O3 films obtained at 150–200 °C, while the α-Ga2O3 films fabricated at 250–350 °C exhibited a larger optical bandgap of 5.15–5.20 eV. The bandgap of the mixed phase films obtained at 400–450 °C was slightly lower than that of the α-Ga2O3 films, presumably due to the contribution of the ε phase.102
The annealing process can also change the crystal states and thus the optical bandgap of Ga2O3 films. Shan et al. found that the bandgap of Ga2O3 films increased from 5.00 to 5.24 eV with the annealing temperature increasing from 500 to 900 °C. It was consistent with the improvement of the film quality from the XRD results.59 A significant blue shift of the absorption edge occurred in the optical transmittance spectra of the annealed Ga2O3 films. The optical bandgap of the as-deposited and annealed film for 2 h were 4.56 and 4.97 eV, respectively. The enlarged optical bandgap might be attributed to the conversion of the metastable-phase Ga2O3 into the β-Ga2O3 and the recrystallization of grains, especially surface nanocrystals.100
Refractive index is an important structural parameter for films that a low index of refraction may indicate porous and highly contaminated samples, whereas a higher refractive index can suggest dense and higher crystalline quality film. Thus, the refractive index commonly obtained by spectroscopic ellipsometry measurement is correlated with the crystal states of ALD-deposited Ga2O3 thin films, which can be tuned by the substrate temperature and annealing process.
The refractive index of the amorphous Ga2O3 films seems to be independent of the substrate temperature in the ALD process. For instance, the refractive index of the grown amorphous Ga2O3 films was relatively constant (1.86 at 632.8 nm) in the investigated substrate temperature range from 80 to 200 °C.98 Choi et al. found that the refractive index of amorphous Ga2O3 films exhibited no significant changes (about 1.72) as the deposition temperature increased from 150 to 250 °C.81 Lu's group reported that the refractive index of Ga2O3 films deposited at 100–250 °C exhibited normal dispersion behavior in the range of 190–800 nm. The amorphous film deposited at 250 °C showed a higher refractive index of 1.95 at a wavelength of 632.8 nm, whereas other films showed a similar value of 1.91.62 Optical constants commonly depend on the crystal structure, where α-Ga2O3 has a larger refractive index than β-Ga2O3, which is consistent with the higher packing density of atoms in α-Ga2O3. The amorphous phase commonly results in a decrease in the refractive index. Borujeny et al. found that the Ga2O3 films started to crystallize at 190 °C, and the films deposited at 125–190 °C had high amorphous content and thus lower refractive index in the entire spectral range. Coexisting β- and α-Ga2O3 films grown at 277 °C had highly crystalline quality and exhibited higher refractive indexes.65
Annealing always induces phase transition and changes the refractive index of ALD Ga2O3 films. Upon annealing under N2 atmosphere at 900 °C for 30 min, amorphous Ga2O3 films were transformed into polycrystalline β-Ga2O3 and the refractive index values were increased from 2.05–1.86 to 2.09–1.92 for the 300–1000 nm spectral range.61 Shan et al. found that the amorphous Ga2O3 thin film as well as the refractive index were maintained after annealing at 500 °C. However, the amorphous Ga2O3 was crystallized into β-Ga2O3, and the refractive indexes increased from 1.84 to 1.89 at a wavelength of 632.8 nm upon annealing at temperatures higher than 700 °C. The air trapped in the low-density thin film would decrease the refractive index; thus, the densification of Ga2O3 films at higher annealing temperature might also increase the refractive index.59 Ilhom et al. achieved amorphous Ga2O3 films at 200 °C, while polycrystalline β-Ga2O3 could be obtained if in situ annealing was incorporated at the end of each ALD cycle. The refractive index of Ga2O3 films increased from 1.78 to 1.84 at 632.8 nm using Ar plasma annealing.66
6. Summary and challenges
The review presented here summarizes the adopted precursors, characterization techniques, and the material characteristics and properties such as growth rate, crystal structure, element composition, surface roughness, optical bandgap, and refractive index of ALD-deposited Ga2O3 films. Several kinds of Ga compounds, especially TMG and TEG, have been used as Ga precursors, while H2O, O3, and O2 plasma commonly act as O precursors, which show distinct reactivity with different Ga precursors. The growth rate calculated from measuring the film thickness via cross-sectional images or optical methods is influenced by the substrate temperature, pulse process, and surface state, while “ALD window” commonly occurs. The crystal structure of Ga2O3 films can be demonstrated in detail by TEM/STEM and XRD and changes significantly by varying the deposition and annealing processing parameters. The chemical composition can be detected by various methods, especially XPS, and the influential parameters include sputtering, substrate temperature, and annealing process. The surface roughness, optical bandgap, and refractive index of Ga2O3 films are mainly revealed by AFM, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and spectroscopic ellipsometry, respectively. They are all related with the crystalline characteristics of Ga2O3 films and thus are commonly affected by the growth and annealing temperatures.
Although remarkable developments have been made for growth optimization of the ALD-deposited Ga2O3 films, there are still some problems to be clarified for more comprehensive understanding.
(1) Al2O3 growth using TMA (trimethylaluminum) and H2O as sources is usually the standard test recipe for new ALD machines. The chemical structure of TMG is rather analogical with that of TMA. However, the ALD deposition of Ga2O3 films using TMG and H2O is limited. What is the difference in the reaction mechanism?
(2) TMG and TEG are widely used as precursors of Ga2O3 films in recent years because of high volatility and high vapor pressure at room temperature. As listed in Table 1, the growth rate is commonly in the range of 0.5–0.7 Å per cycle, which is much lower than that of 1.5 or 2.5 Å per cycle obtained using other Ga precursors. Can the growth rate be improved by optimizing the surface state of the substrate such as increasing the reactive sites on the substrate by tuning the processing parameters?
(3) The growth rates of Ga2O3 films on different substrates such as GaN and Si are found to be different. However, related studies on the influence of substrate type on the growth rate are few and should be enhanced.
(4) At substrate temperature below 400 °C, amorphous Ga2O3 films are commonly formed on the Si substrate whereas, α- and β-Ga2O3 films can be formed on sapphire substrate. What are the synergetic effects of substrate type and temperature on the crystalline characteristics of Ga2O3 films?
(5) The crystalline phase of ALD-grown HfO2 films is closely related with their thickness.104,105 How about the influence of film thickness on the crystalline characteristics of ALD-grown Ga2O3?
(6) It has been reported that ALD-grown Ga2O3 films can be Ga-rich or O-rich. What is the main influential mechanism for the atomic ratio of Ga/O in the ALD process?
