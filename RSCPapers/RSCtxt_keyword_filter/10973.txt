    , Accepted 16th August 2022First published on 22nd August 2022AbstractLead-free hybrid perovskite materials have attracted tremendous consideration due to their applications in photovoltaics, optoelectronics, thermal sensors, etc. Herein, we isolated a new stable semiconductive 2D bismuth(III)–silver(I) iodide hybrid double perovskite formulated as (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8], where H2MPP = 1-methylpiperidinium-4-amine, with reversible solid-state thermochromism, a narrow bandgap and considerable temperature-dependent conductivity. Upon heating from 150 K to 450 K, (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] crystals exhibit a reversible colour change between orange and dark red. The associated structural changes were monitored using in situ single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), UV-visible absorption and Raman spectroscopy. Besides, the electrical conductivity of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] changes over four orders of magnitude upon thermochromism (up to 1.51 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 450 K) and showed an efficiently enhanced photocurrent switching on/off ratio. Moreover, the (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] crystals can be processed into thin films via spin coating and exhibit high stability under heat and moisture, which is indicative of their potential optoelectronic applications based on thermochromism.
Within the rapid progress from simple laboratory devices to industrial-scale solar-cell modules, 3D lead halide perovskite solar cells have attracted tremendous attention and become an important research hotspot due to their low-cost and excellent optoelectronic attributes (a high power conversion efficiency of ∼25.7%).1–5 However, under environmental conditions, the instability and the high rigidity of the 3D lead halide perovskite structure present major drawbacks.6,7 Accordingly, two-dimensional lead hybrid perovskites exhibit much better stability and structure diversity while conserving the same outstanding physico-chemical properties as their 3D counterparts.8–10 In addition, they are extensively used in multiple application fields such as photodetectors, lasers, solar cells, and light-emitting diodes.11–14 Although significant advancements have been made, 2D lead hybrid perovskites have shown increasing environmental problems, which has hindered their use in practical applications.15,16 To improve this situation, a new family of 2D lead-free bimetallic hybrid double perovskites (BHDPs) has evolved recently (BnMIMIIIX8, where B = organic cation, MI/MIII = trivalent and monovalent metal ions, and X = halogen). Within this family, lead is substituted by a combination of trivalent and monovalent metal ions (i.e., 2PbII ↔ MIII + MI).17,18
In fact, BHDPs hold great potential because of their high stability and rich physicochemical attributes.19–22 In the literature, multiple Dion–Jacobson (DJ) and Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) BHDPs have been synthesized that have shown interesting potential. As such, our group synthesized a series of new layered hybrid double perovskite copper–bismuth (Cu–Bi) iodides with different cyclic aliphatic amines through a hydrothermal method.23 These materials present narrow bandgap energy values that vary from 1.53 eV to 1.67 eV as well as high stability, which make them promising for optoelectronic solar-cell devices. Moreover, Liu et al. prepared two new layered BHDPs, (PEA)4AgInBr8 and (i-BA)4AgInBr8 (where [(PEA)+ = C6H5(CH2)2NH3+, (i-BA)+ = CH(CH3)2CH2NH3+]), which show good carrier-transport properties and high X-ray detection sensitivity.24 Very recently, Vishnoi et al. reported that lead-free layered DJ hybrid double perovskites can show interesting magnetic properties when transition-metal ions with unpaired electron spins are incorporated.25 Despite this great progress, 2D BHDPs are still very rare and, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been reported so far on reversible thermochromism.
Indeed, thermochromism is an important property of a material, where a colour change is noted with varying temperature, and which plays an essential role in many technological applications, such as temperature sensors, smart windows, colour filters, smart dyes and anticounterfeiting.26–30 Moreover, it might act as an excellent method for engineering narrow bandgap values and thus improving the optoelectronic performance of the synthesized compound.31 In the literature, the majority of thermochromic substances are usually inorganic materials such as V2O5, VO2, Cr2O3, etc.32,33 Generally, these materials exhibit high thermal stability and present thermochromic behaviour accompanied by their corresponding phase transitions. Other than that, thermochromism has been also found in metal complexes,34,35 liquid crystals,36,37 metal–organic frameworks,38,39 photonic crystals40,41 and organic materials.42,43 In fact, those materials hold a great potential because of their rich physicochemical attributes and their suitability for many applications.
By contrast, there have been several reports on thermochromic single-metal hybrid perovskites, most of them being copper or bismuth halide hybrid perovskites. As such, Zhang et al. synthesized reversible thermochromic two-dimensional copper-based organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, (PED)CuCl4, and (BED)2CuCl6 (where PED = N-phenylethylenediamine and BED = N-benzylethylenediamine), with high working temperature up to 443 K and strong ferromagnetism.44 (1,6-HDA)CuCl4 (where 1,6-HDA = 1,6-hexanediammonium), (4-fluorophenethylaminium)2[CuCl4] and [Dim]2[Bi2X10], where Dim = [1,1′-dimethyl-3,3′-methylene-diimidazolium]2+ and X = Br, and I, have also been reported as thermochromic hybrid perovskites.45–47 Recently, Feng et al. isolated the first reversible thermochromic inorganic lead-free halide double perovskite, Cs2AgBiBr6.31 They showed that upon thermochromism, the Ag–Br and Bi–Br bond distances are elongated with an increase in the temperature. Interestingly, the absorption edge shows a redshift with a narrow bandgap for both single crystals and thin films, making Cs2AgBiBr6 a promising candidate for potential applications in reversible visual thermometers and smart windows.
Herein, we isolated a new BHDP, (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8], that shows reversible thermochromism and tremendous enhanced conductivity upon heating. Interestingly, at 450 K, (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] exhibits a much narrower bandgap of 1.8 eV and showed an improved photocurrent response. DFT calculations match well with the experimental results and presented an indirect bandgap. Furthermore, the (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] thin film showed a high surface coverage and considerable stability under moisture and heat.
Bright-red centimeter-sized crystals of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] were synthesized by stirring a HI solution of stoichiometric amounts of Ag2O, Bi2O3 and 1-methylpiperidine at 438 K for 6 h. Detailed synthesis procedures are provided in the ESI.† Single-crystal X-ray diffraction revealed that (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] crystallized in the centrosymmetric space group P21/n with the following cell parameters (150 K); a = 8.505(4) Å, b = 9.833(4) Å, c = 19.179(9) Å, and β = 99.898(4)° (see crystal data and structure refinement in Table S1, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 1a and Fig. S1a (ESI†), the topography of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] can be described as a DJ 2D monolayered double hybrid perovskite structure. The inorganic component features a 2D framework, assembled through corner-sharing of BiI6 and AgI6 octahedra. Strong Bi–I distances range between 3.0192(10) Å and 3.1235(11) Å, while the I–Bi–I bond angles vary from 85.837(11)° to 175.615(11)°, exhibiting an almost slightly distorted octahedral geometry. On the other hand, due to the larger difference in the Ag–I bond distance, AgI6 exhibits much more distorted octahedra. In fact, the lengths of the two axial Ag–Iax bonds (2.71(12) Å) are shorter than the other four equatorial Ag–I distances (3.1472(12)–3.7867(14) Å). Moreover, the I–Ag–I bond angles ranged from 78.43(4)° to 151.02(4)° (Table S2, ESI†). To estimate the degree of distortion for the BiI6 and AgI6 octahedra, we used the following equations involving Δd(oct) and σ(oct)2: Δd(oct) = (1/6) ∑[dn − d/d]2(1) σ(oct)2 = ∑ (θi − 90)2/11(2)The parameters Δd(oct) and σ(oct)2 express the degree of deviation of the bond distance, and the bond angle variance, respectively.48,49 Here, d is the average distance of the six Bi–I or Ag–I bonds that form the octahedron, dn refers to the six individual Bi–I or Ag–I bond lengths, and θi is the individual I–Bi–I or I–Ag–I angles. In the Bi–I octahedron, Δd(oct) = 2.02 × 10−4 and σ(oct)2 is 0.6076 deg2, and in the Ag–I octahedron, Δd(oct) = 1.89 × 10−2 and σ(oct)2 is 15.037 deg2. Herein, it is obvious that the AgI6 octahedra are more distorted than the BiI6 counterparts in (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8].

Due to its distorted geometry, protonated 1-methylpiperidinium-4-amine plays an important role in stabilizing the crystal structure via several intermolecular interaction types, such as C–H⋯I and N–H⋯I (Fig. S1b and Table S3, ESI†). The PXRD pattern of polycrystalline (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] agrees well with the simulated pattern and no extra peaks appeared, indicating the high homogeneity and phase purity of the title compound (Fig. S2, ESI†). Interestingly, as shown in Fig. S3a (ESI†), the SEM morphology of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] crystals that contain Ag, Bi, I, C and N elements is uniform and homogeneously distributed. Moreover, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] reveal that the chemical ratio of Ag/Bi/I is around 1:1:8, which is similar to the single-crystal XRD result (Fig. S3b, ESI†).
The thermal stability for the powder sample of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] was studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Fig. S4 in ESI,† (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] exhibits high thermal stability until 550 K (the start of decomposition), which is similar to the well-known 3D MAPbI3 hybrid perovskite (MA: methylammonium).50 Thereafter, 81.15% of the original weight was lost between 550 K and 683 K, which was assigned to the organic moieties ‘H2MPP’, bismuth and seven iodine atoms (the theoretical value was 80.56%).
Motivated by its high thermal stability, dramatic reversible thermochromic properties with varying temperature were observed. Indeed, at 150 K, the (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] crystals are an orange colour, which changes slowly to bright-red (stable phase) at room temperature, and thereafter to dark red at 450 K. Interestingly, (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] returns to its stable phase once the temperature decreases. Temperature-dependent optical micrographs of the (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] crystals are shown in Fig. 1b. Accordingly, reversible thermochromism has been obviously also detected using powder sample (Fig. S5, ESI†). To the best of our knowledge, the working temperature (450 K) of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] is among the highest reported for thermochromic hybrid perovskite compounds and is comparable to its inorganic counterparts (Fig. S6, ESI†). Herein, the unprecedented reversible thermochromism in (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] with a high working temperature would be a significant advantage for further temperature-sensing applications.
As detailed above, an increase in temperature leads to a change in the (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] crystal colour, indicating a crystal structure change. In order to explore the crystal structure change, thermochromic (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] was monitored via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements between 30 °C and 550 °C. As shown in Fig. S7, ESI,† DSC clearly indicates that no phase transition has occurred in this temperature range (up to decomposition). To confirm this result, variable-temperature PXRD patterns were also collected. In fact, the powder sample of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] was heated from 298 K to 450 K and then cooled to room temperature (see Fig. S8, ESI†). We noticed that (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] exhibits high thermal stability when the temperature is raised as no new diffraction peaks are seen. Hence, variable-temperature PXRD patterns and DSC measurements showed that thermochromism was not caused by a structural phase transition. Therefore, to comprehend the mechanism of the thermochromism in (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8], we carried out SCXRD for the title compound at several temperatures: 150 K, 298 K, 400 K, 450 K and 298 K (after cooling). Herein, (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] always crystallized in the monoclinic system with the centrosymmetric space group P21/n, based on the results from temperature-dependent PXRD and DSC measurements, which indicate that almost no structural phase transition occurred in the temperature range of 298–550 K (Table S1, ESI†). Meanwhile, as the temperature was raised to 450 K, the crystal data and refinement structure showed an interesting crystal structure change. Indeed, we conscientiously analyzed the average of the Ag–I and Bi–I bond lengths at different temperatures: within the [AgI6] octahedron, the (Ag–I)avg bond length is clearly elongated from 3.2146 Å to 3.2361 Å, whereas the (Bi–I)avg bond length showed less of a change from 3.0767 Å to 3.0817 Å. Interestingly, the (Ag–I)avg and (Bi–I)avg bond lengths return almost to their initial values after cooling to room temperature (Fig. 1c, Fig. S9(a and b) and Table S4, ESI†). These results accord very well with other reported data for Cs2AgBiBr6.31 Moreover, the Ag–I–Bi bond angles also showed an interesting deviation from 169.23° at 150 K to 167.83° at 450 K. Other than that, the cell volume of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] showed a linear increase from 1580 Å3 to 1618 Å3 upon heating to 450 K, which presents a gradual thermal lattice expansion (Fig. S9c, ESI†). Thus, the fluctuations of the Ag–I and Bi–I bond distances at high temperatures and the lattice expansion in the crystal structure might explain the thermochromism behaviour in (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8]. Herein, we should note that the absence of any phase-transition change can explain the excellent reversible thermochromism within the (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] hybrid double perovskite.
The fluctuations in the bond lengths were investigated further via temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy using a 532 nm laser, and the results are shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). In the frequency range between 50 cm−1 and 300 cm−1, we note two principal peaks at 110 cm−1 and 135 cm−1 and various overlapping peaks below 75 cm−1 with low intensity similar to reported silver/bismuth hybrid double perovskite compounds.51 In fact, we attribute the two major peaks to the Bi–I stretching modes. Due to the high distortion of the AgI6 octahedron, the (AgI6)5− modes remain always silent. This accords very well with prior assignments in the Raman spectroscopy of identical material.51 Strikingly, upon heating, the Raman peaks observed between 110 cm−1 and 135 cm−1 gradually became broad and weak. However, upon cooling, the Raman peaks of the title compound are fully recovered. Hence, through the Raman spectroscopy measurements, we also reveal the excellent reversibility and high stability of the hybrid double perovskites under the heating/cooling cycles between 298 K and 450 K.
In order to explore the thermochromism behaviour, we collected the UV-visible absorption spectra for (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] upon heating/cooling cycles (Fig. 2a). In fact, when the temperature was raised, the absorption bands shifted toward high wavelengths with a colour change. Indeed, the absorption cut-off was located at 635 nm at room temperature and at 661 nm, 680 nm and 692 nm upon heating to 350 K, 400 K and 450 K, respectively. Upon cooling to 298 K, the band gap of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] was found at 640 nm, confirming the excellent thermochromic variation of the hybrid double perovskite. Through extrapolation of the linear part of the absorption curves to the energy-axis intercept, we determined their relative direct bandgaps, which varied from 1.94 eV to 1.8 eV as the temperature was increased from 298 K to 450 K (Fig. 2b), and upon cooling to room temperature it increased to 1.93 eV. Herein, the obvious narrowing bandgaps agree very well with the colour change at different temperatures. In addition, the photoluminescence (PL) properties of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] were also measured. In fact, at low temperatures (100 K and 200 K), (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] exhibits a weak band emission across the range of 600–800 nm. By contrast, when the temperature was increased to 298 K, the band emission centred at ∼615 nm became much weaker and accorded very well with bandgap obtained from the UV-visible results (Fig. S11a, ESI†). This weaker band emission is also consistent with the emission reported for similar 2D bimetallic hybrid perovskites.51,52 Indeed, the CIE chromaticity coordinates were found to be (0.44, 0.53), which correspond to a reddish color (Fig. S11b, ESI†). By further increasing the temperature, the emission is quenched and even becomes barely observable, which makes it difficult to verify the reversibility and stability of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] using PL spectra.

(b) Corresponding Tauc plots of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] displaying the extrapolated optical bandgaps for heating and cooling cycles. (c and d) DFT-computed band structure of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] at 400 K (c) and 450 K (d). 
To better understand the optical properties and electronic mechanisms of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8], a DFT calculation was performed using the GGA-PBE exchange–correlation functional without spin–orbital coupling (more information can be found in the ESI†) at 400 and 450 K. Indeed, at 400 K the calculated bandgap of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] was 2.26 eV, which decreased to 2.2 eV at 450 K (Fig. 2(c and d), respectively). Herein, we observe a small difference between the two temperatures, which may be due to the small Bi–I and Ag–I bond-distance variation between 400 K and 450 K (see above). To explore the bandgap nature of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8], we note that conduction band maximum (CBM) and valence band minimum (VBM) are pointing at different Z and G points for different temperatures, which are reminiscent of their indirect bandgaps. Concerning the partial density of states (PDOS) presented in Fig. S12(a–d) and S13(a–d) in ESI,† the CBM originates from Bi-6p and I-4p, whereas the VBM dominates mostly the Ag-4d and I-4p states. Hence, the bandgaps originated mostly from the inorganic frameworks. These results accord very well with reported iodide bismuth/silver hybrid double perovskites.18
To study the optoelectronic performance of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] within thermochromism, we measured the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the hybrid double perovskite compound between room temperature and 450 K using a pressed powder pellet. We notes linear and symmetric I–V curves, indicating the Ohmic contact between the compound and the electrode.53 Strikingly, (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] shows an increase in conductivity upon heating; the electrical conductivity of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] increased from 2.43 × 10−10 S cm−1 at room temperature to 1.51 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 450 K, indicating its semiconducting behaviour (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, we measured the activation energy (Ea) by fitting the temperature-dependent electric conductance according to the Arrhenius equation ln(σT) = ln(A) − Ea/(kBT) (where σ is the electrical conductivity, Ea is the charge-transport activation energy, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and A is a pre-exponential factor). As shown in Fig. 3b, the Ea of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] was found to be around 0.637 eV, which is near to other reported semiconductor perovskite compounds such as (NH4)3Bi2I9 (0.72 eV), Cs2AgBiBr6 (0.35 eV), and MAPbBr3 (0.2 eV),54,55 further indicating that (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] is favorable for electrical conductivity. To reveal the effect of thermochromism on the photoelectric behavior and to further evaluate the semiconducting properties of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8], we measured the photo-conductivity of the title compound at different temperatures using a pressed pellet under a light source with 350 W xenon lamp irradiation. As shown in Fig. 3(c–e), at 298 K, (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] exhibits a low dark current (∼10−9 A), whereas under illumination the photocurrent gradually increases and reaches roughly 4-fold that of the dark current. By contrast, at 350 K and 450 K, the current was enhanced to 7-fold and 13-fold, respectively. Specifically, at a positive bias voltage of 10 V, the current of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] was increased from 4.03 × 10−9 A (dark) to 1.9 × 10−8 A (light) at room temperature. However, at 350 K and 450 K, the current was enhanced from 3.55 × 10−9 A (dark) to 2.51 × 10−8 A (light) and from 2.35 × 10−9 A (dark) to 3.24 × 10−8 A (light), respectively. Thus, the photocurrent switching on/off ratio was enhanced almost threefold via thermochromism (Table 1). As far as we know, this is the first report on thermochromism to improve the photo-detecting performance in BHDPs.

Moreover, (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] shows high stability and reproducibility due to the excellent antifatigue behaviour after repeated switching (on and off) of the light (Fig. 3f). Thus, (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] shows interesting photo-response properties, which further proves its semiconductor properties and indicates its potential for application in light-detecting devices.
Interestingly, the synthesized 2D BHDP was successfully spin-coated into a thin film (more details can be found in the ESI†). As depicted in Fig. S14a (ESI†), XRD of the thin film matched perfectly with the simulated pattern, indicating the high purity and the excellent distribution of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] on the substrate. Similar to the single-crystal results, we note the obvious reversible thermochromic properties of the thin-film sample. Upon increasing the temperature from 77 K to 350 K, the colour of the film changed from yellow to dark-red (Fig. S14b, ESI†). However, it returned to its stable phase upon cooling, confirming the suitability of this material for further processing in thermo-optoelectronic devices. Moreover, the temperature-dependent XRD thin film was also measured and revealed the absence of new diffraction lines that are related to degradation upon heating and cooling (Fig. S14 (ESI†)).
To disclose the suitability of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] for use in photovoltaic devices, Fig. 4a presents the bandgap of a semi-transparent red film measured between 500 nm and 900 nm at room temperature. Strikingly, (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] shows a narrow bandgap (Eg direct = 1.96 eV) determined from diffuse reflectance measurements and converted using the Kubelka–Munk function.56–58 As shown in Fig. 4b and Table S5 (ESI†), the (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] thin film exhibits a much narrower bandgap than several reported hybrid perovskites and even inorganic compounds counterparts (Eg values were found between 3.06 eV and 2.0 eV) proving its suitability for optoelectronic devices.

Details are shown in Table S5 (ESI†). (c) XRD patterns of the (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] thin film before and after exposure to humidity (55% RH) for 30 days. (d) XRD patterns of the freshly prepared film of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] heated at 70 °C for 3 h, 6 h and 12 h. 
Furthermore, the 2D BHDP family shows distinct advantages related to the phase stability, which is very important when developing practicable device applications.22 Herein, the stability of the (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] thin film was studied in the presence of moisture. In fact, we stored freshly prepared thin films of BHDPs in the dark at a relative humidity (RH) of ∼55% for 30 days. We note that the thin film exhibits high moisture stability that is comparable to reported lead-free perovskite compounds (Fig. 4c and Table S6, ESI†). By contrast, we studied the stability of the (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] thin film against heat (70 °C) for different time periods (3 h, 6 h and 12 h). As shown in Fig. 4d, we noticed that the XRD pattern of thin film (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] showed no obvious change compared with the as-prepared sample. Hence, (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] is fairly stable against moisture and temperature, indicating that this BHDP matches the requirements for solar-cell applications.
Conclusion
To summarize, we have successfully synthesized a new semiconducting BHDP compound, the optical bandgap of which can be tuned through thermochromism down to 1.8 eV at higher temperatures. Accordingly, the electrical conductivity of (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] was enhanced over four orders of magnitude (up to 1.51 × 10−6 S cm−1 at 450 K) and showed an efficient light-detecting performance. Besides, (H2MPP)2[BiAgI8] can be processed into thin films and exhibits high thermal and moisture stability. Thus, this material has the potential for thermochromic optoelectronics applications.
