1 Introduction
π-Conjugated luminophores are of great interest in organic optoelectronics on account of their superior thermal stability, structural diversity and unique photophysical properties. They have been widely used in the fabrications of organic light emitting diodes (OLED),1 organic solar cells,2 chemosensors,3 and hybrid materials for biological imaging.4 Conventional synthetic π-conjugated luminophores bear relatively simple photophysical behavior with respect to their certain functional moieties. Therefore, the acquisition of more specific optoelectronic performance normally relies on molecular organizations5 or device fabrication techniques6 using luminophore mixtures. In contrast, stimuli-responsive luminescent compounds7 are a sort of smart molecules in which the photophysical properties can be tuned in a controlled manner. As a result, they have been regarded as promising candidates for developing new classes of responsive optoelectronic materials over the past decade. Numerous novel stimuli-responsive luminophores with different π-conjugated structures have been constantly emerging.7
Scientists are still seeking strategies to make the stimuli-responsive luminophores more advanced and more functional. Multi-response8 is one of the goals, which requires a chemical system to undergo several tuning processes in order to meet different purposes. In addition, the luminescent core structures that can be facilely functionalized to become macro-objects for photophysical applications are also needed. In this short review, we take cyanostilbene-based systems as examples to showcase recent advances in this research area. We first describe the structural characteristics of multi-responsive π-conjugated systems based on cyanostilbene and its derivatives, then highlight the versatile uses of α-cyanostilbene as the core structure for the construction of a series of optoelectronic materials, and finally, discuss the future prospects for the subsequent developments of cyanostilbene-based intelligent luminophores.
2 Cyanostilbene
Stilbene (1,2-diphenylethylene, the chemical structure 1 in Fig. 1) is a typical light-active π-conjugated molecule that has been sufficiently studied in many areas of modern chemistry.9 In addition to its azobenzene-like trans–cis photoisomerization feature,10 it attracts a great deal of attention as a unique fluorescent chromophore.9 Nevertheless, stilbene is currently regarded as a model molecule in luminophore studies, since its quantum yield is relatively low and its emission band is located in the shortwave spectral region.11 To explore more significant roles in meeting the diverse needs in materials science with this luminogen, structural modifications of stilbene are needed.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of (1) stilbene, (2) 4-cyanostilbene, and (3) α-cyanostilbene. The arrows represent the intramolecular rotation of the aromatic groups. 
As a derivative of stilbene, cyanostilbene comprises a stretched π-conjugated skeleton linked covalently with a –CN group (the chemical structures 2 and 3 in Fig. 1). Generally, a conventional cyanostilbene denotes 4-cyanostilbene and the –CN group is located at the para-position of the aromatic ring (the chemical structure 2 in Fig. 1). With the broadening of the π-conjugation, the emission of 4-cyanostilbene can effectively cover the visible region and be monitored by the naked eye. Till now, most studies regarding 4-cyanostilbene have focused on the control or utilization of the phenomenon called twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT),12 especially for those cyanostilbene compounds containing a donor (i.e., –NH2, dimethylamino group, julolidinyl group) at a position opposite to the acceptor –CN group. The TICT effect can be significantly exhibited on these molecules by intramolecular rotation around the central bond upon photoexcitation (indicated by the arrows in Fig. 1). Consequently, a dual fluorescent characteristic of these compounds was observed in many polar solvents, which originated from their locally excited (LE) state and from the TICT state, respectively.13 The TICT state readily produces a high dipole moment and the corresponding fluorescence is very sensitive to the environmental variations. Therefore, 4-cyanostilbene and its derivatives have been employed as fluorescent probes to indicate the micro-environmental changes.13
However, 4-cyanostilbene usually suffers from its incompatibility towards functionalizations. The lack of chemically reactive sites on the molecular structure restricts the post-synthetic modifications to improve the properties. Thus, α-cyanostilbene, a π-conjugated molecule with the –CN group connected with the α-position of the ethylenic bond (chemical structure 3 in Fig. 1), was developed as an alternative. The TICT state and the environmental sensitivity of α-cyanostilbene are still maintained. More importantly, this light-active luminescent molecule can be easily bonded to other units or systems through chemical modifications. In this way, α-cyanostilbene shows greater application potential than 4-cyanostilbene in terms of functionalizations. We will mainly categorize the recent research progress regarding versatile uses of α-cyanostilbene-based optoelectronic materials.
3 Functionality studies on α-cyanostilbene-based optoelectronic materials
3.1 Aggregation-induced enhanced emission (AIEE)
Organic luminophores normally show different emissive behaviors in dilute and condensed media. Their luminescence is often weakened or even quenched at high concentrations, a phenomenon which is widely known as the concentration quenching or aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ).14 In contrast, some luminescent compounds with specific structures can produce aggregation-induced enhanced emission (AIEE), a phenomenon which is opposite to the ACQ effect. AIEE was first discovered by Tang et al. on pentaphenylsilole derivatives.15 Later on, Park and his co-workers also observed a similar phenomenon on an α-cyanostilbene-based compound.16 As the restriction of intramolecular rotations has been well accepted as the driving force for the AIEE effect, dozens of rationally designed prototypes that can exhibit the AIEE phenomenon have been reported.17
In 2004, Park et al. developed an α-cyanostilbene-based low-molecular-mass organic gelator called CN-TFMBE (Fig. 2),18 which is considered as an effective AIEE compound. This molecule cannot gelate 1,2-dichloroethane at a relatively low concentration or under high temperature, and the corresponding solution shows nearly no fluorescent emission (see the left vials in Fig. 2a and b). However, the emission intensity was enhanced over 170 times in the gel state (see the right vials in Fig. 2a and b), which can be directly observed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2c and d). It is also worth mentioning that the compound CN-TFMBE can be used as a gelator without long alkyl chains or steroidal substituents, on account of a cooperative effect of strong π–π stacking interactions between the rigid rod-like cyanostilbene segments along with the supplementary intermolecular interactions induced by four –CF3 units. Since the remarkable fluorescence increase in the CN-TFMBE gel is induced by the AIEE effect, the function of α-cyanostilbene greatly contributes to the design and fabrication of novel responsive soft materials.19

The AIEE effect generated from cyanostilbene analogues can also be found in other forms of molecular structures and assemblies.20 Recently, Neckers et al. synthesized a carbazolyl decorated cyanostilbene derivative CN-CPE.21 The weak luminescence of dilute CN-CPE solution was enhanced upon aggregation formation of 2–3 μm sized crystals (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the crystal formation of CN-CPE leads to a blueshift in the enhanced emission (Fig. 3c). Conformational twisting in the crystal packing process is responsible for the unusual blueshift of the emission in the aggregated form. The AIEE effect of such microcrystals may allow them to function as highly selective chemosensors for the detection of ions through fluorescence quenching.

3.2 Near infrared bioimaging
Optical bioimaging is a popular area in biological and biomedical research. In particular, near infrared (NIR) bioimaging has become the research focus of bioimaging, because the near-infrared (NIR) region at around 650–900 nm exhibits special advantages including minimal interfering absorption and fluorescence from biological samples, low scattering, and deep penetration into tissues.22 In order to design a luminescent unit with an emission band shifted up to the NIR spectral region, large π-conjugated systems have been considered.
Park and his co-workers prepared biopolymeric amphiphiles that were composed of hydrophilic glycol chitosan (GC) as a biopolymeric backbone and a dipolar tricyanostilbene derivative (3CN) as a densely conjugated hydrophobic pendant.23 In the molecular design of 3CN, a dipolar electronic structure was introduced in order to spectrally shift the AIEE of the α-cyanostilbene skeleton to the NIR region capable of bioimaging (Fig. 4a). The amphiphiles can turn into fluorescent nanoparticles (GC3CNx) through self-assembly in water (Fig. 4a). It was found that the fluorescence of GC3CNx nanoparticles was redshifted and intensified by increasing the 3CN content in the biopolymeric amphiphile (Fig. 4c). In vitro and in vivo imaging experiments showed that the GC3CNx nanoparticles could be well applied for the NIR bioimaging (Fig. 4b). In another case, α-cyanostilbene connected with copolymers reveals improved optical properties.24 These examples indicate that the grafts of α-cyanostilbene onto functional polymer backbones can find greater application potentials.

3.3 Bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells
Polymer solar cells (PSCs), a currently hot research topic in the area of energy, have been well understood in terms of their microscopic composition and operation process. Soluble fullerene derivatives are suitable materials to fabricate n-type semiconductors for solution-processed organic electronics.25 In order to maximize the electronic transmission efficiency, such an n-type acceptor was complexed with a p-type donor to form a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer.26 Moreover, there is a need to develop components with higher LUMO to improve the open circuit voltage of PSCs.
Mikroyannidis et al. prepared a modified fullerene F, with the grafting of nitro-α-cyanostilbene onto the [6,6]-phenyl-C-61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) (Fig. 5a).27 As compared with its precursor PCBM, F has a higher solubility in common organic solvents due to the increase of the organic fragment. F in both solutions and thin films showed stronger absorption than PCBM in the range of 400–800 nm (Fig. 5b). Based on the cyclic voltammetry measurements, the LUMO energy level of F is 0.25 eV higher than that of PCBM. F-based BHJ-PSCs exhibit a higher open circuit voltage of 0.86 V and a shorter circuit current of 8.5 mA cm−2, leading to a maximum overall power conversion efficiency of 5.25% (Fig. 5c). The results have been continuously refined by developing other forms of cyanostilbene based PSCs.28

3.4 Switchable viscosity sensors
Viscosity is an important rheological parameter of a fluid. The changes in the fluid viscosity of organisms or biological systems reflect their perturbations or diseases.29 Hitherto, molecule-scale viscometers have been developed to carry out microscopic viscosity measurements where other mechanical apparatus cannot reach.29 As we discussed above, the TICT fluorescence changes can be used to serve as environmental indicators, as an example, for tracking the viscosity changes. Thus, establishing models for quantitatively monitoring the relationship between the luminescent output and the viscosity is required.

p-(Dialkylamino)-benzylidenemalonitrile derivative is a typical molecular rotor, whose fluorescence intensity can be increased dramatically with increasing solvent viscosity.30 Moreover, the logarithm of its fluorescence has a linear relationship with the logarithm of viscosity according to the Förster–Hoffmann equation.31 By combination of this viscosity-sensitive molecular rotor with the conception of molecular switches, Tian and his co-workers developed a cyclodextrin-based polypseudorotaxane containing the photo-responsive tetramethyl julolidinyl cyanostilbene unit (Fig. 6).32 Upon reversible trans–cis photoisomerization of the cyanostilbene group, the sensitivity of the molecular rotor towards the solvent viscosity changes can be either switched off or activated, distinguished by the emission changes.

(c) Emission spectra of PRCD (6 μM, 298 K) in alkaline aqueous solutions (pH 11) under different concentrations (left) before and (right) after irradiation at 254 nm to photostationary state. The inset in the left spectrum is a double-logarithmic plot, showing the ratio between the fluorescent intensity of PRCD and the corresponding viscosity. (Reproduced with permission from ref. 32.

Computational studies using B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) showed that TICT within the cyanostilbene moiety is generated upon photo-excitation on the initial trans-isomer followed by intramolecular rotation of the phenyl group under a relatively free conformation with a dihedral angle of 177.6° (Fig. 6b). Such rotation together with the fluorescence is sensitive to the viscosity change. Upon photoisomerization to the cis-isomer, the molecular rotation is conformationally restricted, as evidenced from a relatively rigid conformation with a dihedral angle of 9.2°, which is not sensitive to its solvent viscosity (Fig. 6b). This α-cyanostilbene unit was further bridged onto β-cyclodextrin (RCD), followed by transformation into a polypseudorotaxane (PRCD), leading to a photoswitchable ratiometric viscosity sensor. This supramolecular ensemble has two fluorescence channels: one arises upon the formation of an intramolecular excimer that is not sensitive to the viscosity, while the other one is originated from the cyanostilbene itself and is viscosity-dependent (Fig. 6c). Afterwards, a dual-mode viscosity sensor was demonstrated by this group.33
3.5 
          In situ photo-tunable white-light emission
White-light emissive materials are very promising candidates for practical applications in visual displays and lighting, because of their superior color fidelity and low color distortion.34 Normally, the acquisition of white-light emission relies on the preparation methodologies. As compared to conventional approaches, the in situ tuning for the white-light emission is advantageous on account of the natural color conversion process. A few research groups have demonstrated the generation of white light from heterogeneous materials using the in situ tuning approach.35 Very recently, Zhao and coworkers developed a single entity through the self-assembly of a thiol-containing dimethylamino α-cyanostilbene luminogen onto the surface of CdSe nanocrystals (Fig. 7).36 The luminescent colors (including white-light emission) can be reversibly tuned by the usage of in situ photochemical and thermal controls.

(e) CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram illustrated from (d). The black dots signify the luminescent color coordinates for the corresponding states 1 (0.39, 0.48), 2 (0.37, 0.44), 3 (0.30, 0.35), 4 (0.26, 0.28), and 5 (0.23, 0.23). (Reproduced with permission from ref. 36. Copyright 2012 John Wiley and Sons.) 
In organic solvents (e.g. ethylene glycol) or polymer-doped solid films, the trans-form of the cyanostilbene unit has a twisted conformation and its photoluminescence is almost quenched by the dynamically intramolecular rotation of its aromatic rings (Fig. 7c). In this case, the hybrid emits a greenish-yellow color, typically generated from the CdSe core (Fig. 7d). When the hybrid is irradiated with 254 nm UV light for 3 h, the trans-isomer of the cyanostilbene unit is partially transformed to the cis-form, which emits strong purplish-blue light since the intramolecular rotation of the aromatic rings in the planar isomer becomes restricted (Fig. 7c). The complementarity of the emission colors from the QD core and the cyanostilbene unit results in white light emission (Fig. 7d and e). Irradiating the hybrid for another 3 h leads to complete conversion of the trans-isomer to its cis-form. The intense emission of the cis-isomer overwhelms that of the QD core, resulting in the color changes of the hybrid to purplish blue. In this way, luminescent color change through yellow, white and blue was achieved for the single entity via an in situ tuning manner. In addition, α-cyanostilbene can be synergized with other organic fluorophores to serve as a switchable chromic system.37
4 Conclusion and future prospects
In addition to the responses to the above-mentioned factors (i.e., light, polarity and viscosity), α-cyanostilbene substituted with other functional groups can be modulated by additional stimuli, such as pH38 and ions.39 For its conformational and size matching, cyanostilbene can also be encapsulated by the cavity of cyclodextrin through the host–guest complexation, forming supramolecular architectures.40 On account of its distinctive structure features, cyanostilbene was even employed in synthetic methodology studies.41
This short review summarizes the emerging research progress on a type of featured π-conjugated skeleton—cyanostilbene, which stands out for its multi-responsive, modifiable, and luminescent characteristics. Plenty of intelligent organic optoelectronic materials based on cyanostilbene and its derivatives have been developed. The relevant research has covered popular fields in modern materials science, including functional materials for energy, biotechnology, and optoelectronics. These intelligent materials have been significantly activating and promoting different research fields. Currently, scientists are carrying out in-depth studies in order to transform these multi-responsive materials into mature, easy-to-handle, and practically applicable devices. Hopefully, all these efforts made or going to be made could build a bridge from functional π-conjugated systems to integrated devices for real life applications.
