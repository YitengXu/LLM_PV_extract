We find from light-assisted capacitance measurements that the charge accumulation inevitably occurred at the electrode and photovoltaic layer interface for bulk-heterojunction ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Ca/Al solar cells. Our results indicate, for the first time through impedance measurements, that the charge accumulation exists at the anode side of the device, and more importantly, we successfully identify the type of charge accumulated. Further study shows that the charge accumulation can significantly affect open circuit voltage and short circuit current. As a result, our experimental results from light assisted capacitance measurements provide a new understanding of the loss in open-circuit voltage and short-circuit photocurrent based on charge accumulation. Clearly, controlling charge accumulation presents a new mechanism to improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic devices have attracted intensive attention due to their unique features such as mechanical flexibilities, facile material processing, and low costs. Recent research developments have demonstrated high photovoltaic efficiencies with the values of around 10% in organic solar cells.1–10 These advancements can be attributed to both materials synthesis and device engineering. In particular, recent experimental studies have shown that inserting a dielectric layer can lead to a large enhancement in photovoltaic efficiencies in organic solar cells.11–14 Our early experimental studies have found that photogenerated charge carriers can inevitably accumulate at photovoltaic/electrode interfaces upon charge transport to respective electrodes.15–17 Obviously, the charge accumulation generates a photovoltaic loss when an organic solar cell is under operation. The impedance spectroscopy is widely used to investigate the interfacial properties of organic solar cells.18–22 Here, we found from photoinduced impedance studies that accumulated charge carriers can modify the effective potential barrier at the photovoltaic layer/electrode interface in organic solar cells under device-operating conditions. Furthermore, we observed that the accumulated charge carriers can affect the open-circuit voltage (Voc) when the effective interfacial potential is changed by charge accumulation. It is known that the Voc is the photovoltage reflecting the energy conversion from photoexcitation to electricity; and both experimental and theoretical studies have been performed, showing that the Voc is essentially determined by the charge-transfer states23,24 and/or the polarization effects25,26 at donor and acceptor molecular interfaces. We find through photoinduced impedance studies that the Voc change resulting from the modification of potential barrier at the photovoltaic layer/electrode interface caused by charge accumulation can directly change the energy conversion from photoexcitation to electricity in organic solar cells.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Ca/Al device at different light illumination intensities from 0.1 sun (10 mW cm−2) to 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) before and after thermal annealing. It has been well studied that thermal annealing can improve the morphological structures in the P3HT:PCBM film and also the interfacial contact of photovoltaic film with electrodes, and consequently enhance the photovoltaic performance by increasing exciton dissociation and charge transport.27–33 Here, our purpose is to use C–V properties as an experimental tool to characterize the surface accumulation of photogenerated charge carriers and to investigate the effects of surface charge accumulation on Voc by comparing annealed and un-annealed P3HT:PCBM devices. Based on thermal annealing-induced modification on bulk morphological structures and interfacial contacts in the P3HT:PCBM device, the C–V characteristics can then reveal the surface accumulation of photogenerated charge carriers and the effects of surface charge accumulation on the effective interfacial potential barrier in the development of Voc. We can see from Fig. 1 that the P3HT:PCBM device shows a larger shift of the C–V peak (Vpeak), when the photoexcitation increases from 0.1 sun to 1 sun, after thermal annealing as compared to the situation before thermal annealing. The following analysis indicates that a larger Vpeak shift corresponds to a greater accumulation of photogenerated charge carriers at the interfaces in the P3HT:PCBM solar cell. Here, we discuss three details from the C–V characteristics. First, the device capacitance under photoexcitation is increased when the applied bias is swept from a negative to positive value towards Vpeak under both conditions before and after thermal annealing. Sweeping the applied bias towards the Vpeak value provides an external electric field against the built-in electric field, leading to a reduction in effective field strength between ITO and Al electrodes to drift photogenerated carriers to respective electrodes. The capacitance increase essentially shows that the photogenerated charge carriers become more accumulated on the surfaces of photovoltaic film when the applied bias is swept towards Vpeak. Second, the charge accumulation reaches a maximum value at the Vpeak voltage. Further increasing forward bias beyond the Vpeak value can clearly reduce the device capacitance. The decrease in device capacitance indicates that an applied bias larger than the Vpeak value can cause a charge injection, in the direction against the transport of photogenerated carriers, to initiate charge recombination inside the device. Therefore, the Vpeak value can be used to evaluate the effective potential barrier for realizing the charge injection at electrode interfaces under device-operating conditions. Third, the Vpeak value decreases as photoexcitation intensity increases from 0.1 sun to 1 sun, leading to a Vpeak shift. Furthermore, the device before and after annealing exhibits smaller and larger Vpeak shifts (0.10 V and 0.19 V), respectively. By combining the above-mentioned three experimental results, we can suggest that the accumulation of photogenerated charge carriers decreases the effective barriers at electrode interfaces in the P3HT:PCBM device under operation conditions.

The reduction in interfacial potential barriers due to the accumulation of photogenerated carriers can be discussed as follows. In the metal–semiconductor contact, the dark injection barrier can be described by the following equation34 (1)where the ni is the surface charge density, Nt is the volume density of molecular sites, ϕi is the potential barrier at the interface between the active medium and the electrode. Apparently, a higher surface charge density corresponds to a lower potential barrier ϕi. We should note that the surface charge density is decided by both injected carriers (namely dark carriers) from electrodes and photogenerated carriers accumulated at photovoltaic layer/electrode interfaces when applied bias initiates injection current at Vpeak. As a result, increasing the intensity of the incident light can increase the accumulation of photogenerated charge carriers at photovoltaic layer/electrode interfaces and then lead to a reduction of the interfacial potential barrier. Clearly, the accumulation of photogenerated carriers can decrease the effective potential barriers at photovoltaic layer/electrode interfaces and consequently shift the Vpeak.
It has been commonly observed that thermal annealing can lead to a reduction in Voc while the power conversion efficiencies are increased in organic solar cells.35–38Fig. 2(a) shows that the Voc decreases from 0.63 V to 0.58 V in the P3HT:PCBM cell after thermal annealing. The Jsc after thermal annealing increases from 6.2 mA cm−2 to 10.8 mA cm−2, and the power conversion efficiency changes from 2.2% to 3.7%. It has been reported that thermal annealing can change surface energy levels and consequently modifies the Voc.39–41 Here, our analysis indicates that the increased surface charges from the accumulation of photogenerated carriers are a new factor that can reduce the Voc upon thermal annealing by decreasing the effective potential barriers at photovoltaic layer/electrode interfaces. Fig. 2(b) shows the C–V characteristics of the P3HT:PCBM device before and after thermal annealing under 1 sun photoexcitation. It can be seen that the Vpeak shifts to a low voltage from 0.42 V to 0.29 V after thermal annealing. Especially, the P3HT:PCBM device before and after annealing exhibits smaller and larger Vpeak changing rates: 44 mV mW−1 cm2 and 87 mV mW−1 cm2 in Fig. 3. This Vpeak shift confirms that the effective potential barriers at photovoltaic layer/electrode interfaces are decreased by thermal annealing. The capacitance increase at zero bias caused by thermal annealing further supports our argument that the surface charge density is increased by the accumulation of photogenerated carriers through morphological development upon thermal annealing, as shown in Fig. 2(b).

Now we discuss the type of photogenerated carriers: either photogenerated electrons or holes, are accumulated to form surface charges which modify the effective potential barrier at the photovoltaic layer/electrode interfaces. The C–V studies have provided powerful techniques to study dynamic processes in organic solar cells under device-operating conditions.34,42–46 However, the type of photogenerated charge carriers accumulated at photovoltaic layer/electrode interfaces has not been explored through C–V analysis. We know that the charge injection occurs at Vpeak. The Vpeak essentially reflects the effective potential barrier at a given photoexcitation intensity. Increasing the photoexcitation intensity can decrease the effective potential barrier and consequently reduce the Vpeak due to the accumulation of photogenerated charge carriers. Fig. 3 shows that the Vpeak shift (from 0.48 V to 0.29 V) after thermal annealing is much larger than that (from 0.51 V to 0.41 V) before thermal annealing when the photoexcitation intensity changes from 0.1 sun to 1 sun. This means that the charge accumulation becomes more significant after thermal annealing as the photoexcitation intensity approaches 1 sun. We should note that the literature reports have shown that thermal annealing can increase the hole mobility by three orders in the P3HT:PCBM device, while the electron mobility did not show significant change.47,48 We can therefore propose that the photogenerated holes are the carriers that form surface charges through accumulation with the consequence of modifying the effective potential barrier on the surface of the hole-collecting electrode (ITO/PEDOT:PSS). This proposed hypothesis can be confirmed by the following experimental results based on a p-type P3HT:PCBM composite device. The p-type P3HT:PCBM device was fabricated with donor-rich P3HT and acceptor-deficit PCBM design with a PCBM weight ratio relative to P3HT at 0 wt%, 5 wt% and 10 wt%, respectively. These p-type devices can exhibit two particular properties: (i) low concentration of photogenerated carriers due to the limited PCBM doping and (ii) a sufficient hole transport channel but an insufficient electron transport channel. In these p-type devices we can only consider the transport of photogenerated holes. We can theoretically expect that with the increase of the PCBM doping level, the appreciable Vpeak shift can be developed because of more efficient photoinduced charge (hole) accumulation when increasing the PCBM concentration.

Fig. 4(a) shows the C–V results for these p-type devices measure under 1 sun condition. We can see a significant Vpeak shift with the different PCBM doping levels. As discussed above, the 5 wt% and 10 wt% PCBM doping in P3HT cannot form efficient PCBM networks, thus the electron transportation is limited. However, the holes have a decent transport channel due to the formation of P3HT networks in the bulk heterojunction structures. Thus, the holes have larger probabilities to accumulate at the interface between the anode and the photovoltaic layer when they are transported towards the anode for charge collection. In other words, the Vpeak shift can be attributed to the hole accumulation at the anode interface. It is noted from Fig. 4(a) that the Vpeak shifts for the devices with 5 wt% and 10 wt% PCBM doping levels are 0.71 V and 0.88 V, respectively, as compared with the Vpeak (1.38 V) for pristine P3HT device. This result is also consistent with the Vpeak shift in the optimized device (80 wt% PCBM doping in P3HT), in which a Vpeak shift from 1.09 V to 0.97 V is observed for un-annealed and annealed situations (see Fig. 3). Moreover, an n-type device is fabricated and conducted under C–V measurement with 10 wt% P3HT doping in PCBM. The C–V peaks for the n-type device are shown in Fig. 4(b). The Vpeak is found to be 0.78 V and it did not shift with increasing light intensity, which is because increasing light intensity cannot significantly change both the charge generation, due to both the deficit of photon absorber (P3HT), and the charge (hole) accumulation at the interface due to the lack of a hole transport channel. Therefore, we can experimentally confirm our hypothesis: the surface charge accumulation comes from the photogenerated holes in the P3HT:PCBM device.

Here, we further analyze the relation between the Voc and Vpeak to understand effects of surface charges on photovoltaic parameters in organic solar cells. Fig. 5 shows the difference (Voc − Vpeak) as a function of photoexcitation intensity ranging from 0.1 sun to 1 sun before and after thermal annealing. It is observed that the difference (Voc − Vpeak) is linearly dependent on the light intensity in logarithmic scale. By combining C–V and I–V characteristics at different photoexcitation intensities, the relationship between Voc and Vpeak can be established by (2)where n is the morphology related factor, K is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and J00 is the characteristic current. For the P3HT:PCBM system, fitting the experimental data in Fig. 5 can give the specific relationship between Voc and Vpeak for the situations before annealing (eqn (3)) and after annealing (eqn (4)). (3) (4)

Therefore, we can see that the surface charges reflected by Vpeak can affect the Voc and Jsc, and consequently the power conversion efficiencies in organic solar cells.
Conclusions
In summary, the photoinduced impedance measurements were used to study the surface charges and effective potential barriers to understand the effects of charge accumulation on key photovoltaic parameters based on the P3HT:PCBM system. We observed from the C–V characteristics that the accumulation of photogenerated carriers can inevitably occur at photovoltaic/electrode interfaces to form surface charges. Furthermore, we found that the surface charges can decrease the effective potential barriers and consequently reduce the Voc when the injection current balances the photocurrent Jsc. By adjusting the transport of photogenerated holes in the C–V characteristics, we confirmed that the surface charges comes from the accumulation of photogenerated holes at the interface between photovoltaic film and the hole-collecting electrode. Moreover, we established the relationship between Vpeak and Voc to understand the effects of charge accumulation on key photovoltaic parameters in organic solar cells.
Experimental
The regioregular poly(3-methylthiophene) (P3HT) and fullerene derivative 1-(3-methyloxycarbonyl)-propyl-1-phenyl (6,6) C61 (PCBM) were used as received from Rieke Metal, Inc. and Nano-C, Inc., respectively. The average molecular weight of P3HT is 50000. Chlorobenzene was used as the solvent to dissolve the P3HT:PCBM composite for spin coating photovoltaic films with the thickness of around 100 nm in a nitrogen atmosphere. The hole-transporting layer (polyethylenedioxythiophene/polystyrenesulphonate (PEDOT/PSS)) was spin cast with the thickness of 40 nm on previously cleaned ITO substrates. The Ca and Al were thermally deposited under the vacuum of 7 × 10−7 Torr. The current–voltage characteristics were measured by using a Keithley 2400 source meter with a sunlight simulator (Thermal Oriel 96000 300 W from Newport). Thermal annealing was carried out in a nitrogen atmosphere by heating the P3HT:PCBM devices at 155 °C for 5 minutes. The C–V measurements were performed by using a dielectric spectrometer (Agilent; E4980A) at different photoexcitation intensities.
