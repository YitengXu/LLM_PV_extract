    , Accepted 20th April 2012First published on 24th April 2012AbstractA film of platinum nanostructure crystals is synthesized for the counter electrode (CE) of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) via an approach of water-in-oil microemulsions in the presence of an amphiphilic polymer, poly(oxyethylene)-segmented imide (POEM). Phase diagrams are constructed in mapping the compositions of the microemulsions to guide the synthesis of platinum nanostructure crystals. The conventional cationic surfactant, cetylmethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), and anionic surfactant, docusate sodium salt (AOT), are compared with the newly developed POEM for preparing the emulsions. Transmission electron microscopic images reveal that the synthesized Pt nanostructure crystals have diversified morphologies, including nanospindle, nanosquare and nanosphere in correlation with the surfactants of CTAB, AOT, and POEM, respectively. X-ray diffraction patterns of the three Pt crystals indicates the presence of (111), (200) and (220) lattice planes of Pt. The Pt with different morphologies and structures are proved to be influential for catalytic ability when using them as Pt CEs in DSSCs. The DSSC with the CE containing the film of Pt nanospheres demonstrates a significantly improved power conversion efficiency of 9.34%, compared to 7.20% and 8.17% for the corresponding Pt nanosquare and Pt nanospindle films. Fourier transform spectroscopy (FTIR), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and cyclic voltammetry (CV) are also used to substantiate the explanation for the DSSC performance.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are important devices, as they are expected to provide an answer to many environmental and energy problems. In addition, these types of cells have many advantages, such as low material cost, easy fabrication, and high efficiency for energy conversion.1–3 A typical DSSC consists of three main components: a photoanode, a counter electrode (CE), and an electrolyte. A catalytic material is usually coated on the CE to assist in the reduction of triiodide ions (I3−). Although many other catalytic materials have been proposed for use in DSSCs, e.g., carbon4–8 and conductive polymers,9–11 platinum (Pt) is still considered to be the best because cells with platinum show the highest power conversion efficiencies.12–15 Sputtering is commonly used to deposit a thin Pt layer on a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) glass substrate.12,13 However, this process requires an ultrahigh vacuum, which is not cost efficient.
Nanomaterials in different shapes are of increasing importance for wide uses because of the associated large surface areas and surface activities. Recently, several methods have been developed for the synthesis of Pt films with different structures, such as rods,16 wires,17 chains,18 quasi-spheres,19 tetrahedrons,20 cubic particles,21 and polypods.22 One of the promising approaches to control crystal size and shape is the surfactant influence on the metal precursors in water-in-oil microemulsions. Under appropriate conditions, surfactants may self-assemble in oil–water systems to form thermodynamically stable microemulsion droplets.23 These small droplets can be viewed as nano-reactors for containing the starting materials or precursors through aqueous reactions.24,25 Microemulsion droplets are usually in the shape of spheres that could confine insoluble solids and consequently derive the product size and shape.24–26 Boutonnet et al. successfully synthesized metal nanoparticles (Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ir) by using water-in-oil (w/o) microemulsions.32 Different microemulsion methods were used to prepare nanostructures of different materials, such as metal oxides, sulfides, and halides.27–35 Bimetallic nanoparticles were also prepared in microemulsion systems that could overcome the difficulties for controlling the composition of the nanoparticles.36,37
The use of surfactants as stabilizers is another important strategy for the achievement of uniform and stable nanoparticles. Preferably, water-soluble surfactants, i.e., anionic or zwitterionic surfactants, have been used to stabilize the Pt nanoparticles.38 With suitable surfactants, the particle size of Pt can be controlled by the surfactant content in the reaction medium.39,40 There has been considerable interest in the development of methods, through this surfactant-approach, for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles in aqueous medium. Recently, we reported the synthesis of a novel amphiphilic polymer, i.e., poly(oxyethylene)-segmented amide–imide (POEM) for the use in the CE of a DSSC;41 POEM can play dual roles as reductant and stabilizer for metal nanoparticles. The reverse micelles of POEM at water-in-oil form can uptake large amounts of water, depending on the selection of nonpolar organic solvent. This capability of reverse micelles of POEM to solubilize large amounts of water usually results in extensive phase areas of water/oil (w/o) microemulsions in the phase diagrams.
In this study, we focused on the construction of phase diagrams in the course of formation of microemulsions, and used the diagrams as the guidance for synthesizing crystals of Pt nanostructures. Phase diagrams of a surfactant, n-butanol, toluene and water system at a fixed surfactant/n-butanol mass ratio of 2 were presented. Different shapes of Pt nanostructure crystals could be synthesized by varying the surfactants interacting with the Pt precursor. The uses of the POEM amphiphile as surfactant to control the formation of Pt nanostructure crystals in different shapes and sizes are correlated to the noncovalent bonding forces of POE (–CH2CH2O–)x segments, aromatic imide (–CONCO–), and amidoacids (–CONH–COOH) in POEM. The presence of microemulsions in water-in-oil form produced solid products that were affected by the surfactants including cationic and anionic species.
Experimental
Materials
Poly(oxyethylene)-diamine or poly(oxypropylene–oxyethylene–oxypropylene) segmented polyether of bis(2-aminopropyl ether) (POE2000, 2000 MW) was a crystalline and water-soluble compound (waxy solid, melting point 37–40 °C, amine content 0.95 meq g−1 with a formula of 39 oxyethylene and 6 oxypropylene units). Monomer, 4,4′-oxydiphthalic anhydride (ODPA, 97% purified by sublimation), Ti(IV) tetra-iso-propoxide (TTIP, >98%), acetonitrile (ACN, 99.99%), acetylacetone (99.5%), isopropyl alcohol (IPA, 99.5%), cetylmethylammonium bromide (CTAB, 99%), and docusate sodium salt (AOT, 99%) were obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. Dihydrogen hexachloroplatinate (H2PtCl6, Alfa Aesar Company, 99.95%), tetrahydrofuran (THF, 95%), and ethyl alcohol (99.5%) were purchased from Teida Chemicals. Lithium iodide (LiI, chemical grade), iodine (I2, chemical grade), and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, 20000 MW) were obtained from Merck Chemical Co. 4-tert-Butylpyridine (TBP, 96%), toluene (99%), and t-butanol (96%) were obtained from Acros Chemicals. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.7%), 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN), and 2-methoxyethanol (99.95%) were obtained from Riedel-de Haën (Fluka), J. T. Baker, and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively.
The TiO2 colloidal solution was prepared by a sol–gel method. Titanium tetra-iso-propoxide (TTIP, 69.1 g, 0.24 mole) was added to 430 ml of 0.1 M nitric acid aqueous solution with continuous stirring and heating at 85 °C for 8 h. When the resultant colloid was cooled down to room temperature, it was transferred to an autoclave (Parr 4540); the temperature of the autoclave was maintained at 240 °C for 12 h. The prepared TiO2 colloid was concentrated to 10 wt%; the obtained TiO2 had particles of about 20 nm in diameter. Large-sized TiO2 (PT–501A, 99.74%, 15 m2 g−1 surface area, 100 nm diameter) was purchased from Ya Chung Industrial Co. Ltd, Taiwan, for use as scattering particles in the TiO2 photoanode.
Synthesis of poly(oxyethylene)-segmented amide imide (POEM)
The POEM polymer was synthesized through the reaction between POE2000 and ODPA at a molar ratio of 6:5, by the procedure described below. POE2000 (10.00 g, 0.005 mol) in THF (15 ml) was poured into a 100 ml three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirrer, nitrogen inlet–outlet lines, and a thermometer. A solution of ODPA anhydride (1.29 g, 0.004 mol) in THF (10 ml) was added to the reactor through a funnel in a drop-wise manner. During the addition, the mixture was stirred vigorously and the reactor was maintained at 150 °C for 3 h. The product mixture was subjected to rotary evaporation under a reduced pressure and was recovered as a yellowish waxy solid. The synthesis of POEM is represented in Scheme 1.41,43

Preparation of the pseudo-ternary phase diagram
The pseudo-ternary phase diagram for the system surfactant + n-butanol/toluene/water was constructed, considering water, toluene, and the emulsifier as the three components of the system.44 The emulsifier was a mixture of surfactant and n-butanol. The mass ratio of surfactant/n-butanol was kept fixed and was equal to 2, and the aqueous solution contained 0.5 M platinum precursor (H2PtCl6). A simple titration technique was used to construct the phase diagram. The emulsifier was first prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of AOT, CTAB, and POEM with n-butanol; an adequate amount of toluene was then added to the mixture. The mixture was kept under stirring for a few minutes in a tightly closed bottle, to ensure complete dissolution of the emulsifier in the hydrocarbon and to avoid evaporation. The amount of toluene added to a fixed amount of emulsifier determines the initial oil mass fraction of the system. The content of each component was derived from precise mass measurements. The water (0.5 M platinum precursor solution) was used as the titration component and was added in small volumes under permanent stirring. The phase boundaries were established by observing turbidity-to-transparency (or transparency-to-turbidity) transitions. Measurements were done in an identical manner for different values of the initial oil fraction to find the boundaries of the microemulsion domain. All measurements were carried out at 25 °C.
Synthesis of shape-controlled Pt nanostructure crystals and preparation of the corresponding CE
Shape selective Pt nanostructure crystals were synthesized by the reduction of Pt(IV) ions in the presence of pseudo-ternary surfactants, using different phase diagrams (AOT, CTAB and POEM). The microemulsion was stirred for 10 min and then shaken for 2 min before the hydrothermal synthesis. The optically transparent, single-phase microemulsion was then transferred to a Teflon® vessel for hydrothermal synthesis. For a control experiment without the microemulsion, the aqueous solution was transferred to a Teflon® vessel for hydrothermal synthesis, right after mixing the precursors. The Teflon®-lined vessel was heated to 130 °C (AOT), 180 °C (CTAB), 220 °C (POEM) at a ramp of 5 °C min−1, and kept at this temperature for 1 h. The product was collected by centrifugation (15000 rpm for a 30 min period) after the temperature of the liquid decreased to room temperature. The collected solid was then washed with ethanol twice under the same centrifugation conditions.
The above obtained solution of Pt nanostructure crystals (0.5 wt% in ethanol) was coated onto the conducting glass (ITO, 7 Ω sq.−1, Ritek Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan) by using the doctor blade technique, and the obtained film was heated to 100 °C for about 20 min in atmosphere. The Pt nanostructure crystals-coated ITO substrate was used as the CE.
Fabrication of DSSCs
A fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass (FTO, 7 Ω sq.−1, visible transmittance ≧ 80%, NSG America Inc., USA) was first cleaned with a neutral cleaner, and then washed with DI-water, acetone, and IPA, sequentially. The conducting surface of the FTO was treated with a solution of TTIP (1.0 g, 0.0035 mol) in 2-methoxyethanol (3.0 g, 0.039 mol) to obtain a good mechanical contact between the conducting glass and TiO2 film, as well as to isolate the conducting glass surface from the electrolyte. TiO2 paste was coated onto the treated conducting glass using the doctor blade technique. The dried TiO2 film was gradually heated to 450 °C in an oxygen atmosphere, and subsequently sintered at that temperature for 30 min. The TiO2 photoanode of the DSSC was composed of a 14 μm thick TiO2 layer and a scattering layer of 4.5 μm thickness. After sintering at 450 °C and cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 film was immersed in a 3 × 10−4 M solution of dye (N719) at room temperature for 24 h. N719 (Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland) was dissolved in ACN and n-butanol (volume ratio of 1:1) to prepare the dye solution. The thus prepared TiO2/dye electrode was placed on a platinum conducting glass electrode (ITO, 7 Ω sq.−1, Ritek Corporation, Hsinchu, Taiwan), keeping the two electrodes separated by a 25 μm–thick surlyn® (SX1170-25, Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland). The two electrodes were sealed by heating. A mixture of 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M DMPII (Solaronix S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland), 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M TBP in MPN/ACN (volume ratio of 1:1) was used as the electrolyte. The electrolyte was injected into the gap between the electrodes by capillarity.
Measurements and instruments
The surface of the DSSC was covered by a mask, allowing an area of 0.16 cm2 for light illumination. The cell was illuminated by a class-A quality solar simulator (XES–301S, AM1.5G, San–Ei Electric Co., Ltd). Incident light intensity (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a standard Si cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc.). Photocurrent–voltage curves of the DSSCs were obtained with a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab, Eco–Chemie, the Netherlands).45 The crystal morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JOEL JEM-1230 electron microscope, operating at 100 kV and photographed with a Gatan DualVision CCD Camera). Morphologies of the Pt nanostructures were observed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, NanoSEM 230, Nova™). Crystal phase and crystallinity were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, MO3XHF, Mac). A Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET, Micromeretics ASAP2020) surface area analyzer was used to determine the surface areas of the Pt nanosquares, nanospindles and nanospheres. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained by the above-mentioned potentiostat/galvanostat, equipped with an FRA2 module, under a constant light illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The frequency range explored was 10 mHz to 65 kHz. The applied bias voltage was set at the open-circuit voltage of the DSSC, between the counter electrode and the FTO–TiO2–dye working electrode, starting from the short-circuit condition; the corresponding ac amplitude was 10 mV. The impedance spectra were analyzed using an equivalent circuit model. The catalytic abilities of the CEs were measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV). CV was carried out in a three-electrode electrochemical system, using Pt nanostructure crystals-coated ITO glass as the working electrode, Pt foil as the CE and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode; the electrolyte for CV experiments contained 10 mM I−, 1 mM I2 and 0.1 M LiClO4 in ACN. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves were obtained at the short-circuit condition. The light source was a class-A quality solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc.). Light was focused through a monochromator (Oriel Instrument, model 74100) onto the photovoltaic cell. The monochromator was moved in steps through the visible spectrum to generate the IPCE (λ) as defined below, IPCE (λ) = 1240 (JSC/λφ)(1)where λ is the wavelength, JSC is the short-circuit photocurrent (mA cm−2) recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat, and φ is the incident radiative flux (W m−2) measured with an optical detector (Oriel Instrument, model 71580) and a power meter (Oriel Instrument, model 70310).
Results and discussion
Phase behaviour
The novel amphiphilic polymer, POEM, was prepared from poly(oxyethylene)-diamine (POE2000, 2000 MW) and dianhydride, 4,4′-oxydiphthalic anhydride (ODPA), at their molar ratio of 6:5, by heating them at 150 °C for several hours. The product is actually a mixture of oligomers, containing polar POE or (–CH2CH2)x segments, an aromatic imide (–CONCO–), and amidoacids (–CONH–COOH), and is characterized by FT-IR (Fig. 1). The idealized structure is illustrated in Scheme 1. Polyether-segmented amidoacids were further cyclized into the corresponding poly(oxyethylene)-segmented imides at 150 °C. The POEM surfactant is soluble in water and the common organic solvents.

Phase diagrams are the composition areas for generating the microemulsion particles that serve for containing metal precursors. The so-called “titration method” was used for controlling the addition of small volumes of water into mixtures of emulsifier (surfactant + n-butanol) and toluene of different proportions, i.e., different initial mass fractions of the hydrocarbon component. The pseudo-ternary phase diagrams at 25 °C, obtained for the surfactants AOT, CTAB, and POEM plus n-butanol/toluene/water, at a mass ratio of 2 for surfactant/n-butanol, are shown in Fig. 2a–c, respectively. For almost all the initial values of oil mass fraction, turbidity was observed for small contents of water. Further addition of water made the system reach and pass through a compositional region of permanent transparency. The appearance of permanent turbidity indicates that the system reached the maximum amount of water that can be solubilized. The region of continuous single-phase microemulsion was thus determined as being the one where permanent transparency was observed, and is indicated in the diagram as the enclosed part by a closed line (J). Below and above the J region, permanent turbidity was observed.

Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis
Pt nanostructure crystals with different shapes were synthesized by the reduction of Pt(IV) ions at various reaction conditions as shown in the pseudo-ternary phase diagrams; the reactions were carried out at 130 °C for AOT, 180 °C for CTAB, and 220 °C for POEM for 1 h, and the Pt nanostructures were then collected by centrifugation. The quantitative yields of Pt crystals synthesized by surfactants AOT, CTAB and POEM were 85.2, 87.5 and 79.3%, respectively. Fig. 3a–f show the TEM images of the shape controlled Pt nanostructure crystals at various reaction conditions. Fig. 3a and b show the TEM images of Pt nanosquares, obtained in the presence of AOT surfactant, at low and high magnifications. The average diameter of the Pt nanosquares is about 100 nm. Fig. 3c is the TEM image of the Pt nanospindles, obtained in the presence of CTAB surfactant, at a low magnification, and Fig. 3d is that of the Pt nanospindles at high magnification. The average length and diameter of the spindles are 150 nm and 20 nm, respectively. Fig. 3e shows a TEM image of Pt nanospheres at a low magnification. Fig. 3f shows a highly magnified image of the Pt nanospheres. The average diameter of the nanospheres is 5 nm; the nanospheres disperse very well in ethanol solution. The TEM images thus clearly show Pt nanostructure crystals of different shapes and sizes; the yield in each case is quantitative. Fig. 4a and b represent the SEM images of Pt nanosquares, obtained in the presence of AOT, at low and high magnifications, respectively. The average diameter of the Pt nanosquares is about 100 nm. Fig. 4c and d show SEM images of Pt nanospindles, obtained using CTAB, at low and high magnifications, respectively. The average length and diameter of the spindles are 150 nm and 20 nm, respectively. Fig. 4e and f show SEM images of Pt nanospheres at low and high magnifications, respectively. The average diameter of the nanospheres is 5 nm. The SEM images thus clearly show Pt nanostructure crystals of different shapes and sizes, which are consistent with those in the TEM images.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the Pt nanostructure crystals by different surfactants, exhibit diffractions in the 2θ range of 25°–80°, as shown in Fig. 5. The three peaks for each pattern are the characteristics of face-centered cubic (fcc) crystalline Pt, corresponding to the planes (111), (200) and (220) at 2θ values of 39.8°, 46.5° and 67.8°. As the intensity of the reflection is directly proportional to the X-ray coherence length of the crystal, the relative intensities of these reflections also vary with the shape of the crystals. All the peaks match well with the theoretical and experimental XRD peaks obtained by Bera et al. in their study on Pt nanoparticles.42 In our synthesis, we used surfactant as a stabilizing agent. The selective interaction of a surfactant with different crystal planes of Pt might alter the growth rate and intensity of different crystal planes.
 Fig. 5  XRD patterns of Pt nanostructure crystals: (a) Pt nanosquares, (b) Pt nanospindles, and (c) Pt nanospheres. The Pt crystals were synthesized by surfactants AOT, CTAB, and POEM, respectively. 
It is demonstrated that the average size of the Pt nanostructure crystals synthesized by microemulsion is smaller than that of the particles obtained from the control experiment (without the microemulsion). Moreover, the morphology of the crystals can be altered. The alteration in morphology of the nanostructures is due to the interaction between the Pt precursor and the components in the microemulsion. It is reported that the adsorption of solvent or other additives onto one face of a crystal can cause a growth on that face, and can therefore be used to affect the crystal morphology of a material.46–48 The microemulsion may influence crystal growth, by interacting with one or more components with certain faces of the growing crystal, so that the growth is mainly limited in certain directions. Hence the Pt nanostructure crystals with various shapes were formed. In microemulsion systems, the surfactant, aqueous and oil phases of microsize droplets have three components and it is likely that one or a combination of the components may influence crystal growth by preferential adsorption of the surfactant on one of the crystal faces. We also investigated the temperature effect of Pt nanostructures. Owing to the common morphology and to the same order of size of microspheres in all the three cases, we did not measure the photovoltaic performance of the cells with films of microspheres. The BET surface areas of the Pt nanosquares, Pt nanospindles and Pt nanospheres were determined to be 6, 9, and 10 m2 g−1, respectively. The data are listed in Table 1.

Photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs with films of Pt nanostructure crystals of various morphologies on their CEs

Fig. 6 shows the photocurrent density–voltage curves of the DSSCs with CEs using the films of Pt nanostructure crystals of various morphologies, i.e., Pt nanosquares, Pt nanospindles, and Pt nanospheres. The photocurrent density–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the DSSCs were measured at an illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The corresponding open-circuit potentials (VOC), short-circuit currents (JSC), fill factors (FF), and cell efficiencies (η) are listed in Table 1. The photovoltaic parameters of the DSSC with the Pt nanosquares in its CE are, VOC = 0.69 V, JSC = 14.89 mA cm−2, FF = 0.70, and η = 7.2%. When the CE of the DSSC has the Pt nanospindles, the photovoltaic parameters are, VOC = 0.78 V, JSC = 18.03 mA cm−2, FF = 0.58, and η = 8.17%. The photovoltaic parameters of the DSSC with the Pt nanospheres in its CE are, VOC = 0.8 V, JSC = 18.15 mA cm−2, FF = 0.64, and η = 9.34%. Thus, the DSSC with the CE with Pt nanospheres shows the highest power conversion efficiency, with reference to those of the cells with CEs having Pt nanosquares and Pt nanospindles. The bare DSSC made with the sputtered Pt CE (75 nm thickness) only gave a cell efficiency of 7.47% under the same illumination conditions (the I–V curve was not shown here). The CE with Pt nanospheres exhibits a very rough and porous surface and has a nearly continuous layer; this has apparently led to a decrease in the charge transfer resistance at the CE of the pertinent DSSC, thereby to a high FF, and ultimately to a high cell performance. The VOC values suggest that Pt nanospindles and Pt nanospheres are more effective than Pt nanosquares in catalyzing the reduction of triiodide to iodide. The onset of the dark current of the DSSC with Pt nanospheres occurs at the highest forward bias (bottom portion in Fig. 6), which indicates that Pt nanospheres have the most efficiently suppressed the dark current, and thereby rendered the highest VOC for their cell. These observations are in conformity with those in the cyclic voltammograms of the three types of CEs, as can be understood in further discussions.

The Pt crystals were synthesized by surfactants AOT, CTAB, and POEM, respectively. 
In addition, the IPCE was measured by monitoring the photocurrent at different wavelengths. Fig. 7 shows the IPCE of the DSSCs with CEs using the films of Pt nanosquares, Pt nanospindles, and Pt nanospheres; these results are consistent with the JSC values, shown in Table 1. These results indicate that the Pt nanospheres in its CE form a nearly continuous layer; this has apparently led to a decrease in the charge transfer resistance at the CE of the pertinent DSSC.
 Fig. 7  IPCE of the DSSCs with CEs having the films of Pt nanosquares, Pt nanospindles, and Pt nanospheres, measured at 100 mW cm−2 light intensity. 
The catalytic properties of the CEs were studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV). Fig. 8 shows the CVs of the CEs with Pt nanosquares, Pt nanospindles, and Pt nanospheres. Each CV in the figure shows an anodic peak current (Ipa) and a cathodic peak current (Ipc), corresponding to the oxidation of I− ions and the reduction of I3− ions, respectively. The magnitude of the Ipc can, thus, express the catalytic ability of a CE for I3− reduction in a DSSC. It is clear that the value of the Ipc of the CE with Pt nanospheres is higher than those of the CEs with Pt nanospindles and Pt nanosquares; this reveals the highest electrocatalytic ability of the CE with Pt nanospheres, among all the CEs. The film of Pt nanosquares has the lowest BET surface area (6 m2 g−1), compared to those of the films of Pt nanospindles (9 m2 g−1) and Pt nanospheres (10 m2 g−1). These differences in surface areas are obviously due to the differences in the shapes of the Pt nanocrystals. The lower surface area of the film of Pt nanosquares is reflected in the lower electrocatalytic activity of its cell, and consequently in the lower JSC and VOC of the cell (Table 1). A lower JSC implies a lower concentration of conduction band electrons in the TiO2 film, a positive shift of Fermi level of TiO2 and thereby a lower VOC for the corresponding cell, because the open circuit voltage is the difference between the redox potential of the mediator and the Fermi level of the nanocrystalline film. Thus, it became clear that the photovoltaic parameters of the cells depend on the shapes of the Pt crystals in their counter electrodes.49

Moreover, an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique was employed to analyze the interfacial resistances in the DSSCs. Fig. 9 shows the electrochemical impedance spectra of the DSSCs with the common configuration of FTO/TiO2/dye/Pt nanostructure crystals/ITO, in which the Pt nanostructure crystals are nanosquares, nanospindles, and nanospheres. The equivalent circuit is shown as an inset in the figure. In general, the EIS spectrum of a DSSC shows three semicircles in the frequency range of 10 mHz to 65 kHz. The ohmic serial resistance (RS) corresponds to the overall series resistance. The first and second semicircles are assigned to the charge-transfer resistances at the CE (Rct1) and the TiO2/dye interface (Rct2), respectively. The Warburg diffusion process of I−/I3− in the electrolyte (Rdiff) is represented by the third semicircle. From the spectra shown in Fig. 9, the Rct1 values of 17.20, 8.08, and 5.19 Ω were obtained for the DSSCs with Pt nanosquares, Pt nanospindles, and Pt nanospheres, respectively. The lowest value of Rct1, in the case of the DSSC with Pt nanospheres, indicates that the conductivity of the pertinent electrode is the highest among all; the highest value of FF for this cell is also consistent with this observation (Table 1). The series resistance value of the DSSC with Pt nanospheres was also found to be substantially lower than those of the DSSCs with Pt nanosquares and Pt nanospindles. The shape and morphology of the Pt nanostructure crystals in the Pt film of a CE thus play a great role in the performance of the pertinent DSSC. Unlike the techniques involving different synthetic precursors and synthetic conditions, this technique allows us to obtain desired size and shape of particles, by using microemulsions to contain the precursor.

Conclusions
We studied the synthesis of Pt nanostructure crystals in different sizes and morphologies by selecting the surfactants and optimization of forming microemulsions in solvents. Phase diagrams of pseudo-ternary surfactants in n-butanol/toluene/water system at the surfactant/n-butanol mass ratio of 2 are optimized for emulsifying 0.5 M of the platinum precursor, H2PtCl6, in water. The solution behavior presents a vast one-phase microemulsion region, in which a structural transition occurs continuously, without a phase separation from water/oil to oil/water. The TEM images demonstrated different shapes and sizes of Pt nanostructure crystals that were synthesized from the Pt precursors in different compositional microemulsions. The Pt nanostructure crystals in the different morphologies of nanospindles, nanosquares, and nanospheres were largely controlled by the surfactants of CTAB, AOT and POEM, respectively. After being fabricated into films for the CE, the Pt nanosphere crystals exhibited high surface roughness and consequently enhanced electrocatalytic ability, lower charge transfer resistance (Rct1) at their interface with the electrolyte, and lower series resistance in the pertinent DSSC. Ultimately, the DSSC with a CE made with the Pt nanosphere film demonstrated the best solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) of 9.34%. It is concluded that the morphological control of Pt nanostructure crystals for fabricating the CE is substantiated for the performance of the pertinent DSSC.
