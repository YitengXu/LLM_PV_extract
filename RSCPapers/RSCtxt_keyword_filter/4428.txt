    , Accepted 8th August 2017First published on 8th August 2017AbstractAll polymer organic solar cells afford unique potentials due to the tunable chemical and electronic properties of both polymer donors and polymer acceptors. Compared with the rapid development of polymer donors, the development of polymer acceptors lags far behind. To seek high-performance polymer acceptors used in organic solar cells, based on the experimentally reported D–A polymer acceptor (NDI2OD-T2)n (P1), a series of novel acceptors, designated as (BDTNDI2OD-T2)n(P2), (BDTNDTI)n(P3), (BDTNDI2OD-Tz2)n(P4), and (BDTNDTzI)n(P5), were designed by introduction of a benzodithiophene (BDT) unit and the nitrogen atom in the bridged thiophene ring. The density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) methods were applied to study the effect of the BDT unit and the nitrogen atom on the geometrical, optical, electronic, and charge transport properties. The obtained results show that incorporation of the electron-donating BDT unit into P1 and the replacement of a carbon atom by the nitrogen atom in the bridged thiophene ring are effective strategies to lower the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy and exciton binding energy, and enhance light-absorbing capacity and electron mobility. Moreover, among the investigated molecules, P2 and P5 exhibit stronger and broader light absorption, higher light absorption efficiency and exciton separation ability as well as electron mobility; therefore they are recommended as promising polymer acceptors for future high-efficiency organic solar cells.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted widespread attention owing to their ease of processing, mechanical flexibility, and potential for cost-effective mass production.1–6 At present, the performance of bulk-heterojunction-type (BHJ) OSCs7 has been improved steadily and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 11% has been achieved for fullerene-based OSCs.8–10 The traditional electron acceptors, fullerene derivatives (e.g., PC61BM and PC71BM), show many advantages involving high electron mobility, and delocalization of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) over the whole molecular surface to accept and transport electrons in three dimensions.11 However, fullerene-based acceptors possess several significant disadvantages, including invariable energy levels, relatively weak absorption ability in the red and near-infrared regions, difficult purification, and lack of chemical/morphological stability.12–15 Therefore, recent studies have been devoted to explore non-fullerene acceptors, which can be classified into two types: small molecules5,14,16–18 and polymers.19–22
All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs)2,19,23,24 with both donor and acceptor polymers have attracted remarkable interest due to their significant advantages over fullerene-based solar cells. The PCE of the all-PSCs has been steadily increased from 2% to 8% recently.19,23,25 For example, the PCE of PPDT2FBTH:N2200 based all-PSCs has been increased to 5.1%.21 A PCE of 7.7% was achieved by using a high-mobility polymer acceptor (PNDIS-HD) and polymer donor (PBDTT-FTTE).26 It is a significant challenge to exploit new polymer acceptors with remarkable electron mobility, a broad absorption spectrum, and well-matched energy levels with polymer donors in the all-PSCs. Of the building-blocks used for designing polymer acceptors, perylene diimide (PDI)-based27 and naphthalene-based diimide (NDI)21,23,28 acceptors are widely used due to their small π–π stacking distance, relatively high electron mobility, air stability, tunable solubility, and ambipolarity capabilities.29 For instance, P(NDI2OD-T2) shows unprecedented characteristics due to its high field-effect electron mobility (0.1–0.85 cm2 V−1 s−1), high electron affinity, and light absorption ability at near-IR wavelengths.12,21 P(NDI2OD-T2) and its derivatives have been widely used in all-PSCs,2,19,25 where a maximal PCE of 8.27% has been reached by using a polymer donor J51 with P(NDI2OD-T2) as the acceptor.19
In addition, due to the advantages of the modified benzodithiophene (BDT) unit such as a large planar conjugated structure and the ability to easily form co-facial π–π stacking, BDT units as per alkylthiophene- or alkylthiothiophene-substituted BDTs form a promising class of high-performance π-conjugated polymer donors with remarkable hole mobility and spectral coverage.30 For instance, Li et al. synthesized a BDT-based polymer donor, PBDTT-S-TT, which showed PCEs over 8.4%.31 Although 2D-conjugated BDT units were used as donor materials in the PSCs in the past few years, polymer acceptors based on BDT units have received much less attention. Chen et al. designed the first BDT and naphthalene diimide (NDI)-based copolymer in 2010,32 whereas the photovoltaic performances of PBDTNDI were not characterized at that time. In 2013, Xu and coworkers synthesized two BDT-NDI polymer acceptors together with PBDTNDI as the polymer donor achieving a very small PCE of 0.02% in PSC devices.33 Hou and coworkers reported a PSC based on polymer acceptor PBDTNDI-T showing a high PCE of 2.88%.30 Obviously, there is still much scope for further enhancement in the performance of BDT-based polymer acceptors.
Herein, on the basis of the reported donor–acceptor (D–A) polymer (NDI2OD-T2)n (P1),2,19,34 we designed four novel D–A conjugated polymers (BDTNDI2OD-T2)n (P2), (BDTNDTI)n (P3), (BDTNDI2OD-Tz2)n (P4), and (BDTNDTzI)n (P5) (see Fig. 1 for the structures), where the modified BDT is the electron-donating unit, and NDI or NDTI acts as the electron-accepting unit. The geometric structures, the energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the LUMO, the electron transport abilities, the light absorption properties, and the electron-harvesting abilities of P1–P5 were investigated in detail. In addition, referring to the donor material J51,19 the free energy loss and the exciton binding energy were also investigated to provide in-depth insights into the charge transfer characteristics and the performance of the OSCs.

2. Computational details
All calculations on the oligomers studied in this work were fully optimized by the density functional theory (DFT) method35 using the Gaussian 09 software.36 The calculated vibrational frequencies of all molecules show that no imaginary vibrational frequencies are present, which means that all the optimized structures are stable structures. In the calculations, all the alkyl side chains of polymers were replaced by methyl groups, because the long chains have proved to only aid in increasing the solubility with little effect on the frontier molecular orbitals and optoelectronic properties.37,38 Solvent effects of chloroform were added using the conductor-like polarizable continuum model of solvation (C-PCM).39
It is well known that the energy levels of organic molecules strongly depend on the employed functionals in DFT calculations. In order to find the reliable method, we have tried a series of hybrid functionals (PBE0,40 B3LYP,41 and HSE0642) with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set to compute the HOMO and LUMO energies of (NDI2OD-T2)1 (M1), (NDI2OD-T2)2 (D1) and (NDI2OD-T2)3 (T1) for P1, and the obtained results together with available experimental values are summarized in Table 1. Note that the experimental HOMO and LUMO energies are evaluated from an empirical formula proposed by Brédas et al., which is based on the onset of the oxidation and reduction peaks measured by cyclic voltammetry in experiments.43 As shown in Table 1, the calculated HOMO energy on the trimer (T1) model of P1 at the HSE06/6-311G(d,p) level (−5.54 eV) is very close to the experimental value of P1 (−5.52 eV).12 Similarly, the calculated result of the LUMO energy at the HSE06/6-311G(d,p) level on T1 (−3.93 eV) agrees well with the reported experimental value of P1 (−4.02 eV).12 So the ground-state properties of all oligomers in this work were studied at the HSE06/6-311G(d,p) level, which have been proven to be successful in previous similar studies.44,45

Based on the optimized ground-state structure of T1 at the HSE06/6-311G(d,p) level, the absorption spectrum of T1 was calculated by TD-DFT35 using a suite of hybrid functionals of B3LYP, PBE0 and HSE06 with the 6-311G(d,p) basis set. As shown in Table 2, the absorption peak (712 nm) of T1 at the TD-PBE0/6-311G(d,p) level agrees well with the experimental value (702 nm).12 Hence, the optical properties of all oligomers were calculated at the TD-PBE0/6-311G(d,p) level. The transfer integral was performed at the M06-2X/6-311G(d,p) level due to the fact that the M06-2X method yields reliable results on describing the electron correlation terms and long-range interactions of organic molecular pairs, such as π–π interactions.46 Moreover, the plots of the electron density difference (EDD) map were used to describe the intermolecular charge transfer between the ground state (S0) and the first excited state (S1) using Multiwfn 3.3 code.47

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Optimized geometries and electronic properties
The ground-state geometries significantly impact the electronic properties, optical absorption, intermolecular π–π stacking, and electron mobility of the polymers.48,49 Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the ground-state structures of the polymers. Here the ground-state structure parameters of P1–P5 are deduced on the basis of those of the corresponding monomers (M1–M5), dimers (D1–D5), and trimers (T1–T5) (see Fig. 1). The optimized structures of T1–T5 are shown in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Optimized geometries of T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5 calculated at the HSE06/6-311G(d,p) level. Color code: yellow (S), red (O), blue (N), grey (C), and white (H). 
The summary of selected bond lengths and dihedral angles of monomers, dimers, and trimers of P1–P5 is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S1 (ESI†), the optimized bond lengths and dihedral angles do not generate prodigious variation with the oligomer size, which indicates that describing the basic structures of the polymers by their trimers is appropriate. The selected bond lengths of the carbon–carbon bonds (C–C) (1.43–1.47 Å) of monomers, dimers, and trimers for P1–P5 are shorter than that of the C–C single bond (1.54 Å), which exhibit some double-bond character due to π-bonding interaction, thereby strengthening and shortening the bridge bond. The above results indicate that the π-electrons are delocalized over the entire molecular configuration rather than being localized on the donor or acceptor unit. The calculated absolute values of dihedral angles for the oligomers of P1, P2, and P4 in the range of 15–60° indicate that these non-planar arrangements can reduce self-aggregation in BHJ blend films and stabilize the molecules.50,51 When the NDTI replaces the NDI2OD-T2 unit, the dihedral angles of the monomer, dimer, and trimer of P3 between the electron-rich unit and the electron-deficient unit are almost negligible. The decrease of the dihedral angle is due to the new core NDTI with a large molecule plane, which is beneficial to strengthen the intramolecular π conjugation and intermolecular π–π stacking. The dihedral angle further reduces when the carbon atoms on the NDTI unit in P3 are changed by the nitrogen atoms on the NDTzI unit in P5. Among the five polymers, P5 has the best planarity, which implies that it may have stronger intrachain π conjugation, a greater interchain electronic coupling effect, and a higher carrier mobility in comparison to other polymers.
3.2 Frontier molecular orbitals
The HOMO/LUMO energies and the HOMO–LUMO energy gaps (Egs) are greatly associated with the electronic properties and optical absorption, which are key factors for the PCE.38,52 An ideal acceptor should possess suitable HOMO/LUMO levels in comparison with those of the donor to ensure fast charge separation and further electron transport. Hence, we analyze the HOMO/LUMO energy levels and Egs of the five polymers. The HOMO/LUMO energies, and energy gaps (Egs) of P1–P5 were obtained by plotting the HOMO and LUMO energies, and Egs of the corresponding monomers, dimers, and trimers inverse their reciprocal chain length and extrapolating to infinite chain length (n = ∞) (representing the corresponding polymers), which has been successfully employed to investigate other polymers.52,53 The HOMO/LUMO energies, and the energy gaps (Egs) of monomers, dimers, and trimers of P1–P5 are listed in Table 3 and Fig. S2 (ESI†). The molecular orbital plots of T1–T5 are given in Fig. 3. We can see that the HOMO of T1 is mainly delocalized on the bridge units, while for T2, T3, T4, and T5, the densities of the HOMO are mainly delocalized on the bridge units as well as on the BDT ring. Moreover, the LUMOs of the five trimers are mainly centralized on electron-deficient units.

 Fig. 3  Electron density plots of the HOMO and the LUMO for the five trimers at the HSE06/6-311G(d,p) level. 
As shown in Table 3, Fig. 3 and Fig. S2 (ESI†), the HOMO and LUMO energies have the same trend that with the increasing conjugation lengths the HOMO energies increase, whereas the LUMO energies decrease. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energies and Egs exhibit excellent correlation with the repeat unit of the polymer, where the extrapolated HOMO energies of P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5 reduce to −5.24 eV, −5.17 eV, −5.51 eV, −5.49 eV, and −5.64 eV, respectively, while the corresponding LUMO energies increase to −4.00 eV, −4.12 eV, −4.21 eV, −4.05 eV, and −4.30 eV, meanwhile the Eg values decrease to 1.23 eV, 1.20 eV, 1.29 eV, 1.44 eV, and 1.34 eV, respectively, as the degree of polymerization tends to infinity. The calculated HOMO/LUMO energies of M1, D1, and T1 are −6.08 eV/−3.79 eV, −5.62 eV/−3.90 eV, and −5.54 eV/−3.93 eV, respectively, showing that the calculated HOMO and LUMO energies of P1 gradually approach the experimental values (−5.54 eV and −4.02 eV)12 with the increasing values of the repeat unit. Furthermore, it is appropriate to study the trimer (T1) for polymer P1, because the calculated HOMO/LUMO energy (−5.54 eV/−3.93 eV) for T1 is close to the experimental value of P1 (−5.52 eV/−4.02 eV).12
So we mainly analyze the HOMO and LUMO energies and Egs of trimers T1–T5. The Eg is 1.60 eV for T1, 1.48 eV for T4, 1.44 eV for T5, 1.41 eV for T3, and 1.41 eV for T2. The Eg is indirectly proportional to the maximum absorption of the polymer. The lower Eg of T2, T3, T4, and T5 compared to that of T1 indicates that the newly designed polymers may enhance the short-circuit density (JSC) of the OSC compared to T1, because the lower energy gap will generate a broader absorption range which will increase the amount of charge carriers, thus leading to a higher PCE. The comparison of T2 with T1 reveals that the HOMO and the LUMO levels move upward from −5.54 eV to −5.31 eV and from −3.93 eV to −3.90 eV respectively, while the energy gap moves downward from 1.60 eV to 1.41 eV. This result is due to the introduction of the electron-donating BDT unit into T1. By replacing the carbon atoms in the conjugated bridges of T2 with nitrogen atoms in T4, the HOMO/LUMO energies decrease from −5.31 eV/−3.90 eV to −5.50 eV/−4.02 eV, respectively, leading to an increase in the energy gap from 1.41 eV to 1.48 eV. These results are due to the introduction of a stronger electron-withdrawing nitrogen atom in the conjugated bridge to replace a carbon atom in P2, which can significantly increase the electron-withdrawing ability of the conjugated bridges of the polymer. By the change of the NDI2OD unit in T2 to the NDTI unit in T3, the HOMO/LUMO levels decrease from −5.31 eV/−3.90 eV to −5.53 eV/−4.12 eV, while the energy gap is almost unchanged. These results are due to the enhancement of the π conjugation degree of the copolymer backbone in NDTI than that in NDI2OD-T2. Besides that, changing the carbon atom on the NDTI unit in T3 to a stronger electron-withdrawing nitrogen atom in T5 can reduce the HOMO/LUMO energies from −5.53 eV/−4.12 eV to −5.65 eV/−4.22 eV, and increase the energy gap slightly from 1.41 eV to 1.44 eV. These results mean that control on the molecular planarity and the electron-withdrawing ability of the electron-deficient unit can tune both the HOMO/LUMO levels and energy gaps.
It has been experimentally found that the LUMO energy of an n-type air stable transistor should be below −4.0 eV.52 As can be seen that the extrapolated LUMO energies of the designed acceptors P2, P3, P4, and P5 are all below −4.0 eV, indicating that they might act as air-stable electron-transporting semiconductors in OSCs. Compared with PC60BM, the typical acceptor mostly used in OSCs with a LUMO energy of −4.3 eV,53 the designed polymer acceptors (P2, P3, P4 and P5) with higher LUMO energies are beneficial to improve the VOC of the OSC devices because the energy offset between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor is directly related to the VOC.
3.3 Spectral properties
Not only the light absorption properties of the donor to improve the short-circuit current density (JSC), but also the light absorption performance of the acceptors, especially the light absorption in the visible-near-infrared region to improve the JSC, is very important.21 However, the mismatch of the absorption band for the donors and the fullerene derivatives as acceptors often results in a low light-absorbing efficiency or low JSC.15JSC can be expressed as48 (1)where S(λ) is the number of incident photons with wavelength λ per unit area, ηEQE(λ) denotes the light harvesting efficiency of the active layer, and it is related to the light-absorption efficiency (ηλ), exciton-diffusion efficiency (ηED), charge-transfer efficiency (ηCT) and charge-collection efficiency (ηCC).54,55 In detail, ηλ can be written as ηλ = 1 − 10−f(2)where f is the oscillator strength of the acceptor associated with a particular wavelength.54,55 Here, we only collect the ηλ at the absorbing band of the lowest transition (S0 → S1) peaks.
The optical properties of the five polymers were calculated at the TD-PBE0/6-311G(d,p) level based on the optimized ground state structures at the HSE06/6-311G(d,p) level. The detailed electronic transitions, including the maximum absorption wavelength (λ), the largest oscillator strength (f), the main configuration, and the light- absorbing efficiency (ηλ) of trimers (T1–T5), are summarized in Table 4. In addition, the corresponding related electronic transitions of monomers (M1–M5) and dimers (D1–D5) are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The simulated Gaussian type absorption spectra of T1–T5 are shown in Fig. 4 (where the first 50 excited states are considered).

 Fig. 4  Simulated absorption spectra of T1–T5. 
As can be seen in Table 4, the main electronic transitions in T1–T5 are assigned to the π → π* type and the strongest absorption peaks of T1–T5 in the visible region are mainly dominated by the HOMO → LUMO, and HOMO−1 → LUMO transitions. From Table S1 (ESI†) and Table 4 we can see that the oscillator strength (f) increases strongly when the repeat unit increases. With increasing conjugation lengths, the strongest peaks are red-shifted. Take P1 as an example, the maximum absorption peaks of M1, D1, and T1 are at 304 nm (the S12 state, f = 0.7696), 669 nm (the S1 state, f = 1.1683), and 712 nm (the S1 state, f = 1.9485), respectively. It is obvious that the absorption spectrum exhibits a red-shift trend and the oscillator strength increases with the elongation of the conjugation length.
Clearly, it is necessary to study the trimer for the P1 system because the calculated strongest absorption peak is at 712 nm for T1, while the experimental value of P1 is about 702 nm.12 Thus we focus on the performance of the absorption spectra of the trimers.
In terms of the maximum absorption, as can be seen in Table 4 and Fig. 4, the designed T2 (ηλ = 0.9920), T3 (ηλ = 0.9998), and T5 (ηλ = 0.9976) exhibit much better light-absorbing efficiencies than T1 (ηλ = 0.9887). A comparison of the maximum absorption peak of the designed T2, T3, and T4 with that of T1 shows that the maximum absorption peaks are markedly red-shifted. This can be confirmed by the fact that the Eg values of T2, T3, and T4 are smaller than that of T1. So the maximum absorption peaks are more red-shifted. The position of the maximum absorption peak is at 712 nm for T1 (f = 1.9485), while the positions of the maximum absorption peaks are at 751, 754, and 739 nm for T2 (f = 2.0943), T3 (f = 3.7275), and T4 (f = 1.8482) in the visible-near-infrared region, respectively.
Comparing T2 with T1, the results presented above show that the introduction of a BDT unit in T1 can yield a more intense and broader light absorption in the visible and near-infrared region. For T3, the introduction of the NDTI unit to replace the NDI2OD-T2 unit in T1 can obviously improve the intramolecular π conjugation and the light-absorbing efficiency. The above discussions and results demonstrate that T2, T3, and T4 can yield a more intense and broader light absorption in the visible and near-infrared region than that of T1, resulting in a better spectral overlap with the donor absorption spectrum. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 4, the maximum absorption of T5 is blue-shifted by only 4 nm in comparison with T1, but the light-absorbing efficiency and the absorption strength of T5 in the visible and near-infrared region increase significantly in comparison with T1. Consequently, taking ηλ, the maximum absorption wavelength, and the absorption region in the visible and near-infrared into account, the JSC can be improved with T2, T3, and T5 as acceptors.
3.4 Other factors affecting JSC

SC is influenced by exciton dissociation, charge transfer, and the capability of charge photogeneration and so on. Next, we will analyze the electron density difference, the charge transfer factors, the exciton binding energy, and the Gibbs free energy loss in the charge dissociation process to reveal the performance of these factors.

3.4.1 Charge transfer factors. 
In order to clarify the spatial extent associated with an electronic transition from the ground state to the excited state, the electron density difference (EDD) map and the calculated charge-transfer (CT) indexes (the electron transfer ΔD, the overlap between the barycenters of the density depletion and increment regions upon electronic excitation Λ, and the transferred charge amount ΔF) upon the S0 → S1 transition for the five trimer transitions are shown in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  Electron density difference plots of electronic transition for the five trimers. ΔD is the electron transfer distance (Å), ΔF is the fraction of electron exchange (|e−|), Λ denotes the overlap between the regions of density depletion and increment. Electron densities transfer from the light green area to the purple area. 
As shown in Table 4 and Fig. 5, it is evident that the S0 → S1 electronic transitions of the five trimers mainly arise from the HOMO → LUMO transitions, and the corresponding direction of electron transfer is from the electron rich units to the electron-deficient moiety. The calculated data in Fig. 5 show that the electron transfer distance (ΔD) and the transferred charge amount (ΔF) increase, while the overlap (Λ) decreases in comparison of T2, T3, T4, and T5 with T1. These results are in favor of increasing the electronic transfer efficiency for OSCs. For example, the order of the S0 → S1 electron transfer distance (ΔD) is T1 (0.044 Å) < T4 (4.499Å) < T2 (8.522Å) < T3 (15.373Å) < T5 (16.531Å). The tendency of Λ is T4 (0.9781) > T1 (0.9629) > T2 (0.9559) > T3 (0.8949) > T5 (0.8747). By comparing the results of T2 with T1, we can see that incorporation of the BDT unit can lengthen the conjugation, which can promote charge separation and significantly augment the electron transfer distance. The introduction of the NDTI unit in T3 and the NDTzI unit in T5 to replace the NDI2OD-T2 unit in T1 can promote charge separation and expressively increase the electron transfer distance. The transferred charge amount (ΔF) values for T2, T4, T3, T5, and T1 are 1.053|e−|, 1.057|e−|, 1.074|e−|, 1.551|e−|, and 0.663|e−|, respectively. The computed ΔF values of all designed trimers are larger than that of T1, which means that T2, T3, and T5 have smaller Coulomb attraction, stronger intramolecular charge transfer, and higher charge separation efficiency. From the above analysis, it is clear that the larger ΔD and ΔF, and the smaller Λ for T2, T3, and T5 contribute to enhance the light-absorbing efficiency of polymer acceptors to improve the JSC for the OSCs.


3.4.2 Exciton binding energy and the Gibbs free energy loss. 
It is known that the acceptor of the organic active layer can harvest sunlight to generate excitons, followed by the transfer of holes from the HOMO of the acceptor to the HOMO of the donor, and subsequently the exciton diffuses until it arrives at the D/A interface.45,56 However, the hole−electron pair does not straightly separate into free charges which are bounded by a large exciton binding energy (Eb).45 Here, Eb is defined as the energy difference between the electronic and optical band gap energies. The electronic band gap is of the energy difference between the HOMO and the LUMO in the ground state, and the optical gap is taken as the first singlet excitation energy. For a charge transfer process of an acceptor exciton, the condition of exciton dissociation to be energetically favorable is EB,A smaller than IPA − IPD. IPA and IPD are the ionization potentials of the acceptor and donor, which are about equal to the negative HOMO of the acceptor and the donor.57 The calculated HOMO value of donor J51 is −4.80 eV. The exciton binding energies (Eb), the differences of ionization potential between the acceptor and the donor (IPA − IPD), and the Gibbs free energy losses (ΔG) of T1–T5 are listed in Table 5.

As shown in Table 5, the binding energies (Eb) of T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5 are 0.67 eV, 0.40 eV, 0.63 eV, 0.87 eV, and 0.67 eV, respectively, which are smaller than the corresponding difference between the ionization potentials of the acceptor and the donor (IPA − IPD). This reveals that T1–T5 can guarantee efficient exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interface. Compared with T1, T2 and T3 have smaller Eb data, indicating better performance of T2 and T3 for exciton dissociation.
On the other hand, an electron of the ground state in the donor would be excited upon illumination of light of a suitable wavelength. Then, an electron of excited state in J51 can spontaneously transfer to the acceptor when the Gibbs free energy loss (ΔG) is a negative value.58 The key step is the dissociation of the electron–hole pair into free charge carriers at the organic interface and the charge spread in the acceptor. Meanwhile, the hole and the electron can be collected by the electrodes. We can assess the ability of charge transfer through the Gibbs free energy loss (ΔG), which is estimated from the Rehm–Weller equation as follows:49,54 ΔG = IP(D) − EA(A) − ΔES1 − ΔEb(3)where IP(D) and EA(A) represent the ionization potentials of the polymer donor J51 and the electron affinity of the acceptor, respectively. ES1 and Eb are the energies of the S1 state of the free-base donor and exciton binding energy, respectively. The ΔG data for the five trimers are summarized in Table 5.
As shown in Table 5, the ΔG values of acceptors T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5 are −1.41 eV, −1.47 eV, −1.57 eV, −1.66 eV, and −1.76 eV, respectively. All the ΔG values of the five acceptors are negative, implying that an electron of the donor in the excited state can spontaneously transfer to the acceptor. The ΔG values of the designed trimers are lower than that of T1, which means that the excited electrons in the donor would easily transfer to the newly designed acceptor.
Combining the above two aspects (Eb and ΔG), it can be seen that the designed acceptors T2, T3, and T5 can effectively promote the capability of charge carrier separation, potentially enhancing ηCT, and the photocurrent generation in OSCs.

3.5 Electron-harvesting ability of acceptors
In OSCs, high-electron-affinity of the acceptors has been certified to be an effective method for speedy exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interface, and the electron affinity of the acceptors must be large enough to permit effective injection of electrons into the empty LUMO of the semiconductor molecules.2,59 The electron affinity needs to be higher than 3.0 eV, but should not be much higher than 4.0 eV.60 The calculated vertical electron affinities (VEA) and adiabatic electron affinities (AEA) of T1–T5 are given in Table 5.
As shown in Table 5, the VEA/AEA values of T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5 are 3.73 eV/3.80 eV, 3.67 eV/3.74 eV, 3.96 eV/4.00 eV, 3.79 eV/3.85 eV, and 4.05 eV/4.09 eV, respectively. This result shows that the electron affinities of the five trimers are all higher than 3.0 eV, and not much greater than 4.0 eV. So the electron affinities of the five trimers are appropriate to allow efficient injection of electrons into the empty LUMO of these acceptors, and the five trimers might be stable in air. Our results show that the five trimers can ensure efficient exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interface.
3.6 Performance of acceptors in intermolecular electron transport
Once the exciton splits into free charges in the charge transfer state at the D/A interface, the generated electrons and holes move along the interpenetrating network of the acceptors and donors toward their respective electrodes. In the OSC device, the active layer as a charge transport layer with high hole and electron mobility contributes to improving the charge transport (to increase JSC and FF). It is well known that the transfer integral is significantly influenced by the path of the intermolecular arrangement of the neighboring molecules. However, an accurate prediction of intermolecular π-stacking paths for polymers is still a great challenge in theory.49,61 To date, many reports have shown that the face-to-face π-stacking with a large orbital overlap has a major contribution to the intermolecular electron transport properties of organic semiconductors, which is beneficial to enhance the electronic coupling.44,49,61 Hence, we only consider the face-to-face parallel π-stacking direction between the adjacent molecules for the intermolecular electron transport properties of these copolymers. The starting distances of the two piled molecules in the five investigated systems T1–T5 are set as about 3.95 Å, which is the experimentally measured π–π stacking distance in P1.12 The 3D models of the two adjacent fragments of T1–T5 are given in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The calculated intermolecular center-to-center distances (r) of T1–T5 are listed in Table 6. We can see that the optimized center-to-center distance of the two molecules in T1 is 3.93 Å, which agrees well with the experimental result of 3.95 Å for P1.12 The obtained intermolecular distances for T2–T5 are 4.02 Å, 4.88 Å, 7.12 Å, and 4.91 Å, respectively. Table 6 also displays the calculated transfer integrals (υ), inner reorganization energies (λ), electron transport rates (kCT), and the electron mobility (μ) of T1–T5.

From Table 6, it is clear that the designed molecules T2 (0.055 eV), T3 (0.068 eV), T4 (0.030 eV) and T5 (0.066 eV) have much smaller λ than T1 (0.105 eV). According to eqn (S3) and (S5) (ESI†), small reorganization energy results in a relatively high electron transport rate. By comparing the designed trimers T2, T3, T4, and T5 with T1, the results revealed that incorporation of the BDT unit, and the introduction of the NDTI unit and the NDTzI unit to replace the NDI2OD-T2 unit can significantly decrease the λ value. On the basis of eqn (S4) (ESI†), the results (see Table 6) show that the electron mobilities of these trimers are mainly determined by the electron transport rates (kCT) and the intermolecular center-to-center distances (r). Moreover, the calculated electron mobility of T1 (1.60 cm2 V−1 s−1) agrees well with the experimental data of 1.28 cm2 V−1 s−1.12 The electron mobility is in the following sequence T3 (0.61 cm2 V−1 s−1) < T1 (1.60 cm2 V−1 s−1) < T4 (2.81 cm2 V−1 s−1) < T5 (3.22 cm2 V−1 s−1) < T2 (3.68 cm2 V−1 s−1). From the above discussion, we infer that the newly designed T2, T4 and T5 show better electron mobilities than that of T1. Consequently, considering the abilities of electron transport, the newly designed polymers T2, T4, and T5 can provide a large JSC and FF when used in the organic solar cells.
4. Conclusions
In this work, to explore more efficient acceptor materials for organic solar cells, we have designed four new D–A conjugated polymers (P2, P3, P4, and P5) by incorporating the BDT unit in the experimentally synthesized polymer P1. To illustrate the optical and electronic properties, we studied their HOMO/LUMO energy levels, light-absorbing efficiencies, and electron affinities as well as electron mobility of the trimers (T1–T5) by quantum-chemical calculation methods and Marcus theory. By comparison of T2 with T1, it is found that incorporation of the BDT unit in T2 not only yields a stronger and broader light absorption in the visible and near-infrared region, and enhances the light-absorbing efficiency and the exciton separation efficiency at the donor/acceptor interface, but also manifests high electron transport rate. Moreover, by comparing T5 with T3, we conclude that increasing the electron-withdrawing ability of the electron-deficient unit can further improve the exciton separation efficiency at the donor/acceptor interface and the electron mobility among the interchains. In our designed compounds, the polymers (P2 and P5) exhibit stronger and broader light absorption, high light absorption efficiencies and exciton separation abilities as well as higher electron mobility among all polymers, indicating that they are potential candidates for acceptor materials of OSCs. This study presents guidelines for designing efficient copolymer acceptors for organic solar cell applications.
