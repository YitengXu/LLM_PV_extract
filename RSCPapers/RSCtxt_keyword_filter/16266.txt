    , Accepted 20th February 2014First published on 21st February 2014AbstractThe potential application of poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) based liquid crystalline rod-coil block copolymers in polymer solar cells has been investigated. The two liquid crystalline copolymers bear a rodlike liquid crystal block poly(4-(dodecyloxy)-4′′-(oct-7-en-1-yloxy)-1,1′:4′,1′′-terphenyl), (P3HT-b-Pterph), and a discotic liquid crystal block poly(2,3,6,7,10-pentakis(hexyloxy)-11-(oct-7-en-1-yloxy)triphenylene), (P3HT-b-PTP), respectively. Solar cells based on the two self-assembled liquid crystalline block copolymers blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) show poor photovoltaic performance due to the introduction of the low conductive non-conjugated liquid crystalline block. The device performance was improved after thermal treatment at the liquid crystalline temperature originating from the self-orientation of the liquid crystalline block copolymers and the formation of well-organized domains in the blend. However, for utilization of the liquid crystalline block copolymers as compatibilizers in P3HT:PCBM blends, the morphology combined with the photovoltaic performance of P3HT:PCBM solar cells can be significantly improved after annealing from the liquid crystalline states. It is demonstrated that the self-assembly of the liquid crystalline block at the donor and acceptor interface can enhance the crystallization and ordering of P3HT chains and guarantee the formation of interpenetrating networks, subsequently resulting in the improvement of efficient exciton separation of the active layer. The copolymer with the discotic liquid crystal block is more favorable than the one with rodlike liquid crystal block, due to the greater compatibilitytwith the fullerene acceptors and the more efficient charge transport caused by the self-assembled columnar phase from the discotic liquid crystals. Therefore, the optimized morphology and promoted charge mobility improved the short-circuit current density and fill factor to give power conversion efficiency up to 4.03%.
1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells composed of a conjugated polymer donor and fullerene derivative acceptor have spurred worldwide attention in the past two decades, because of their potential for low-cost renewable energy sources, flexibility and facile large scale manufacturing by printing.1–4 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been significantly improved over 9% for single cells and 10% for multi-junction cells.5–7 Despite continuous improvement in PCE, the overall performance of conjugated polymer donor and fullerene derivative based solar cells is still limited by many drawbacks, such as the difficulty in developing the desired nanomorphology of active layer for efficient charge separation and transportation, and the thermal instability of the morphology during long term annealing.8–10 Further advancement of performance and the stability of devices is thus required to satisfy commercialization.11,12
In bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, the local conjugated polymer ordering, fullerene derivative agglomeration and phase separation between the donor and acceptor are directly correlated to the performance of devices.8,13 Thereby, a continuous nanoscale interpenetrating network structure of the active layer is crucial for high performance BHJ solar cells with improved stability. The nature of the conjugated block copolymer molecular architecture comprising a rod-like conjugated block and a coil-like block with additional functionalities enables them to self-assemble into a variety of highly organized and thermodynamically stable morphologies,14–16 which is regarded as an effective strategy for controlling the microphase separation morphology of the active layers.14,16,17 Utilization of block copolymers in BHJ solar cells to manage the micromorphology is primarily through three approaches. Firstly, the self-assembled block copolymers based on donor and acceptor building blocks were used as the active layer alone.18 Secondly, block copolymer donors were blended with fullerene derivative acceptors to form the BHJ active layer.19,20 However, the PCEs of the devices based on both of these methods are very low, which has been ascribed to the too high fraction of insulating moiety introduced into the block copolymer chain. Incorporation of block copolymers as compatibilizers in conjugated polymer/fullerene derivative blends is found to be the most promising approach for obtaining the desired active layer morphology.9,13,21–23
Liquid crystalline materials have been studied extensively due to their unique electronic and optoelectronic properties.24–27 It has been reported that introduction of a liquid crystalline block into block copolymers could arrange the copolymers with well-organized nanostructures owing to the nature of mesoscopic ordering.25,26 The degree of molecular orientation of the liquid crystalline conjugated block copolymer can be further enhanced by an external perturbation such as shear stress, or an electric or magnetic field.26 Therefore, liquid crystalline materials have drawn extensive attention in the field of OPV,27–29 including some work in our groups.30–36 High performance of solar cells was achieved through the intermolecular and mesoscopic ordering of liquid crystalline materials, especially when annealed in the liquid crystalline state.33,35
Herein, we extend our previous works and report on two poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) based liquid crystalline rod-coil block copolymers bearing a poly(4-(dodecyloxy)-4′′-(oct-7-en-1-yloxy)-1,1′:4′,1′′-terphenyl) block (P3HT-b-Pterph) and a poly(2,3,6,7,10-pentakis(hexyloxy)-11-(oct-7-en-1-yloxy)triphenylene) block (P3HT-b-PTP), respectively, and their application in polymer solar cells. The solar cells based on the two self-assembled liquid crystalline block copolymers blended with PCBM show poor photovoltaic performance, even after thermal treatment at liquid crystalline temperature, due to the low conductivity of the non-conjugated liquid crystalline block. However, when the liquid crystalline block copolymers are utilized as compatibilizers in P3HT:PCBM blends, the photovoltaic performance of P3HT:PCBM solar cells could be significantly improved after liquid crystalline state annealing. The self-assembled liquid crystalline block copolymers can induce the crystallinity of P3HT, and cocrystallize with P3HT chains, resulting in a long range crystallinity of P3HT domains. On the other hand, the liquid crystalline blocks located at the interface of the P3HT and PCBM domains can promote the formation of favorable interpenetrating networks. The modified crystallization and ordering of P3HT chains thus guarantee the efficient charge mobility of the active layer. The optimized morphology and enhanced hole and electron mobility consequently led to the improved PCE up to 4.03%.
2. Experimental section

P3HT-b-Pterph and P3HT-b-PTP were synthesized through atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) using bromoester terminated P3HT macroinitiator (P3HT-Br) as initiator (Scheme 1), with CuBr and 1,1,4,7,10,10-hexamethyl triethylene tetramine (HMTETA) as catalyst and ligand, respectively. P3HT-Br was fabricated according to a procedure reported previously.37 The polymerization was performed at the molar ratio of [monomer A or B]:[CuBr]:[P3HT-Br]:[HMTETA] = 100:1:1:2. P3HT-Br (0.11 g, 0.01 mmol) and monomer A or B (10 mmol) were dissolved in toluene in a dry flask filled with nitrogen. After the mixture was stirred for 30 min, the flask was immersed into a preheated oil bath at 90 °C. Then, HMTETA (5 μL, 0.02 mmol) and CuBr (1.46 mg, 0.01 mmol) were added to the reaction mixture to react overnight. Then, the reaction mixture was cooled and precipitated by pouring into methanol. The liquid crystalline block copolymers were collected by filtering under reduced pressure. The polymers were purified by Al2O3 column chromatography and sequential Soxhlet extractions with methanol, hexane, and chloroform. The polymers were isolated via precipitation in methanol. The liquid crystalline block copolymers were characterized by 1H NMR. P3HT-b-Pterph, 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 7.60–7.55 (m, 8H), 6.98 (m, 5H), 4.00 (t, 4H), 2.90 (m, 2H), 1.8–1.68 (m, 9H), 1.56–1.27 (m, 34H), 0.92 (t, 6H). P3HT-b-PTP, 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3) δ (ppm): 7.84 (s, 6H), 6.98 (s, 1H), 4.23 (t, 12H), 2.68 (d, 2H), 1.87–1.58 (m, 17H), 1.50–1.25 (m, 42H), 0.92 (t, 18H). (The detailed experimental procedures and characterization of the monomers and polymers are given in the ESI.†)
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of P3HT-b-Pterph and P3HT-b-PTP. 
The solar cell device was fabricated as follows. Indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass (15 Ω per square) substrates were firstly patterned (15 mm × 15 mm) and etched. Then, the ITO substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication in deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol sequentially each for 20 min. The cleaned ITO substrates were treated with plasma for 10 minutes. The solutions of liquid crystalline block copolymers and PCBM were prepared by dissolving P3HT-b-Pterph or P3HT-b-PTP and PCBM (1:1 w/w) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) at a concentration of P3HT-b-Pterph or P3HT-b-PTP of 10 mg mL−1, then the solutions were stirred at 50 °C in a glove box overnight. The P3HT/P3HT-b-Pterph or P3HT-b-PTP/PCBM ternary solutions were prepared by introducing P3HT-b-Pterph or P3HT-b-PTP into P3HT/PCBM (1:1 w/w) DCB solution with the P3HT-b-Pterph or P3HT-b-PTP concentrations varying from 0 to 10 wt% with respect to the amount of P3HT:PCBM, where the concentration of P3HT was 10 mg mL−1. In order to promote complete dissolution, the solutions were stirred at 50 °C in the glove box overnight. The conventional architectures of devices were glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al. A 30 nm layer of poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulphonate (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P VP A1 4083) was spin-coated on ITO glass at 4000 rpm for 60 s. The PEDOT:PSS coated substrates were heated at 140 °C for 10 minutes in air to dry. The mixed P3HT-b-Pterph or P3HT-b-PTP/PCBM solution or P3HT/P3HT-b-Pterph or P3HT-b-PTP/PCBM solution was spin-coated on the top of PEDOT:PSS layer at a spin rate of 800 rpm for 60 s. After the films dried, a top metal cathode (1 nm LiF and 100 nm Al) was thermally evaporated using a shadow mask to complete the device fabrication.
Structural analyses of the monomers and polymers were performed by using 1H NMR spectroscopy (600 MHz Varian spectrometer), using deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) as a solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy (performed by Perkin-Elmer Lambda 750 with integrating sphere) and photoluminescence spectrometry (Hitachi F-7000) were employed to shed light on the photophysics and electronic properties of P3HT-b-Pterph, P3HT-b-PTP and all the active layers. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL, Edinburgh Instrument FLS920) was employed to determine the photoluminescence decay with a H2 gas lamp as the light source. The nanostructures of the active layers, P3HT-b-Pterph and P3HT-b-PTP were confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Digital Instrumental Nanoscope 31) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL, JEM-2100F, field emission transmission electron microscope). The peak currents were measured by conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) using peak force tapping tunneling AFM (Bruker, MultiMode 8, PeakForce TUNA). The thermostability of the liquid crystalline block copolymers was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) performed under N2 with a TA instrument SDT-Q600 thermogravimetric analyzer. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC, Perkin-Elmer DSC 7 differential scanning calorimeter) was employed to investigate the phase-transition temperatures of the liquid crystalline block copolymers with a constant heating–cooling rate of 5 °C min−1. The textures of the liquid crystalline monomers and block copolymers were observed by polarizing optical microscopy (POM, Nikon E600POL polarizing optical microscope) equipped with an Instec HS 400 heating and cooling stage. The out-of-plane grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) profiles were recorded by using a Bruker D8 Discover reflector with an X-ray generation power of 40 kV tube voltage and 40 mA tube current. In order to increase the effective X-ray penetrating depth and minimize the background from the substrate scattering, the angle between the incident beam and the film surface was fixed at 0.2°. The testing of current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices under illumination and in the dark was done using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter. The light intensity of the simulated AM 1.5 G illumination (Abet Solar Simulator Sun2000) was 100 mW cm−2.
3. Results and discussion
The liquid crystalline rod-coil block copolymers P3HT-b-Pterph with rodlike terphenyl mesogen and P3HT-b-PTP with disc triphenylene mesogen were synthesized through the “grafting-from” method using a P3HT macroinitiator (P3HT-Br). The bromoester terminated P3HT macroinitiator P3HT-Br was prepared according to a previously reported procedure.37,38 The liquid crystalline block was grown by atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of monomer A or B with mesogens,25,34,39,40 as depicted in Scheme 1. The chemical structure and the molar ratio of the liquid crystalline block copolymers were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy (Fig. S1†), and the molar ratios of P3HT block to liquid crystalline block were 9:1 and 10:1 for P3HT-b-Pterph and P3HT-b-PTP, respectively. The molecular weights of P3HT-b-Pterph and P3HT-b-PTP were Mw = 14900 and Mw = 16500, respectively. The detailed experimental procedures and structural characterization are provided in the ESI (Scheme S1, Fig. S2 and S3†).
The thermal and phase behaviors of the liquid crystalline rod-coil block copolymers P3HT-b-Pterph and P3HT-b-PTP were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM), as summarized in Table 1. From the TGA (Fig. S4†) we can infer that P3HT-b-Pterph and P3HT-b-PTP began to decompose at about 416 and 403 °C, respectively, and lost most of the weight at about 500 °C, suggesting good thermal stability. In the DSC measurements (Fig. S5†), both liquid crystalline block copolymers displayed good reproducible thermograms. The second heating curves of P3HT-b-Pterph and P3HT-b-PTP exhibit endothermal peaks at 174.8 and 150.3 °C, associated with their liquid crystalline phase transitions. The nature of the liquid crystallinity can also been verified by the POM photomicrographs (Fig. 1). Monomer A shows a smectic phase while monomer B possesses a typical columnar phase texture from heating–cooling cycles. During heating, the two liquid crystalline block copolymers presented birefringent and homogeneous textures in the liquid crystalline states, nevertheless, the mesophase could not be distinguished clearly.41

The photoluminescence (PL) and absorption data of the liquid crystalline rod-coil block copolymers are also listed in Table 1. Fig. S6† presents the UV-vis absorption spectra of P3HT-b-Pterph and P3HT-b-PTP films. The absorption spectra of P3HT-b-Pterph and P3HT-b-PTP are basically the same. The two characteristic absorption bands in the absorption spectra correspond to the polythiophene block in the visible light region (∼560 nm) and the π–π* transition of the liquid crystalline block in the ultraviolet region around 270 nm. The two liquid crystalline block copolymers display a sharp shoulder at about 605 nm, indicating that the polythiophene backbones in the block copolymers could self-assemble to the orderly molecular arrangement.42,43 The self-assembly behavior of the liquid crystalline rod-coil block copolymers was further supported by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. 1. The P3HT-b-Pterph and P3HT-b-PTP thin films show long-range arrangement of highly interconnected fibrillar objects, which is the well-known self-assembly morphological signature for most polythiophene based block copolymers.44,45 The liquid crystalline block copolymer P3HT-b-Pterph and P3HT-b-PTP films show a characteristic PL emission peak at 637 and 642 nm, respectively, originating not from the liquid crystalline moiety but from the polythiophene backbones.46
The optical bandgaps estimated from UV-vis absorption spectra onset for P3HT-b-Pterph and P3HT-b-PTP are 1.88 and 1.90 eV, respectively. The highest occupied molecular orbitals (EHOMO) of P3HT-b-Pterph and P3HT-b-PTP are determined at 5.35 and 5.30 eV from the onset oxidation potential of the corresponding cyclic voltammograms (Fig. S7†). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (ELUMO) of P3HT-b-Pterph and P3HT-b-PTP calculated from the values of optical bandgaps and EHOMO are 3.47 and 3.40 eV, respectively. These results indicate that the two liquid crystalline block copolymers possess narrow bandgaps and low ionization, therefore, photovoltaic performance based on the liquid crystalline block copolymers could be expected.
The potential application in solar cells of the liquid crystalline rod-coil block copolymers was explored. Photovoltaic properties of P3HT-b-Pterph (or P3HT-b-PTP):PCBM based solar cells were investigated with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT-b-Pterph (or P3HT-b-PTP):PCBM/LiF/Al. The photovoltaic characteristics of the devices at different thermal treatments under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 are summarized in Table 2, and the representative current density–voltage (J–V) curves are depicted in Fig. S8.† Both P3HT-b-Pterph and P3HT-b-PTP based solar cells exhibit poor PCE of 0.34–0.44% and show anomalous S-shaped J–V curves with low fill factors (FFs) in the range of 20–25%, and short-circuit current densities (Jsc) of 2.83 and 3.62 mA cm−2, respectively. It is well known that interfaces play a critical role in determining electric field distribution, charge extraction and collection.47 In this case, the poor conductivity of the liquid crystalline block in the copolymers would create interfacial dipoles and/or a hole collection barrier near the anode, subsequently leading to S-shaped J–V curves and the reduction of FF and/or Jsc values.48

After thermal annealing, especially from the liquid crystalline states, the device performance was slightly improved to 0.56% for P3HT-b-Pterph and 0.63% for P3HT-b-PTP. When the annealing temperature (200 °C) was beyond the liquid crystalline states, the device efficiency dramatically decreased. The change in PCE is mainly contributed from the change in Jsc after thermal annealing. Fig. S9† presents the normalized UV-vis absorbance spectra of P3HT-b-Pterph/PCBM and P3HT-b-PTP/PCBM active layers before and after annealing at different temperatures. It is evidenced that the optical absorption of the liquid crystalline block copolymer based active layers slightly increased after thermal annealing in the range of liquid crystalline state temperatures. This is because liquid crystalline state annealing promotes the orientation of mesogens to induce polythiophene backbone packing with higher ordering.42,49 The enhanced ordering of polymer chains is favorable for charge carrier mobility, thus improving the Jsc. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. S10,† annealing at liquid crystalline state temperatures induces the most quenched PL of the liquid crystalline block copolymers and PCBM blends, therefore, the improved Jsc is also partly from the more efficient exciton dissociation.50 The improved molecular ordering induced by liquid crystalline state annealing can be verified by the increased dichroism (NF) in the polarized photoluminescence spectra of the active layers which were determined from the ratio of perpendicular polarization (F⊥) to parallel polarization (F∥), as shown in Fig. S11, S12 and Table S1.† Furthermore, surface topography images of the active layers annealed at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 2. The root-mean-squared (RMS) roughness for the P3HT-b-Pterph based active layer extracted from the AFM images decreases from 4.6 nm for as-cast to 3.1 nm for the film annealed from the liquid crystalline state, and then increases after further elevating the annealing temperature to 200 °C. The change in RMS for the P3HT-b-PTP based active layer exhibits a similar tendency. These observations are in good agreement with the J–V curves shown in Fig. S8.†

Rod-coil block copolymers can serve as compatibilizers in polymer solar cells to modify the nanostructure of active layers, and to improve device performance.9,13,21,22 For the liquid crystalline rod-coil block copolymers P3HT-b-Pterph and P3HT-b-PTP as nanostructuring compatibilizers in P3HT:PCBM based solar cells, the assembly of liquid crystals and the molecule–block interaction between the P3HT block and P3HT are expected to induce a long range crystallinity of P3HT domains. In addition, due to the π–π interaction between the liquid crystalline block and the fullerene acceptor, liquid crystalline blocks located at the interface of P3HT and PCBM can improve the interfacial compatibility and guarantee the formation of thefavorable interpenetrating networks. The J–V curves of the devices based on P3HT:PCBM:P3HT-b-Pterph and P3HT:PCBM:P3HT-b-PTP with various amounts of P3HT-b-Pterph or P3HT-b-PTP are shown in Fig. 3, and the device characteristics are summarized in Table 3. Due to the liquid crystalline state annealing optimizing the morphology of the active layer, the study of devices based on P3HT:PCBM:P3HT-b-Pterph was performed after post-annealing at liquid crystalline state temperature 175 °C, and P3HT:PCBM:P3HT-b-PTP devices were annealed at 150 °C. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 3, incorporation of a small amount of the liquid crystalline block copolymers can greatly improve the Jsc and FF of these devices. Among the devices based on P3HT:PCBM:P3HT-b-Pterph and pristine P3HT:PCBM, incorporation of 3 wt% P3HT-b-Pterph into the active layer achieves the best performance of 3.34 ± 0.15%, together with the Jsc increasing from 8.97 ± 0.2 mA cm−2 to 9.58 ± 0.3 mA cm−2, and the FF increasing from 45.1 ± 1% to 58.1 ± 1%. Moreover, the devices based on P3HT:PCBM:P3HT-b-PTP show overall more improved performance than those based on P3HT:PCBM:P3HT-b-Pterph. The discotic liquid crystal block in P3HT-b-PTP is more compatible with the fullerene acceptors, which guarantees the more favorable interpenetrating networks. On the other hand, the self-assembled columnar phase from the discotic liquid crystals favors the more efficient charge transport. The highest PCE of 4.03 ± 0.15% is achieved when the concentration of P3HT-b-PTP is 5%, with a Jsc = 10.36 ± 0.3 mA cm−2, and a FF = 64.9 ± 1%. A higher weight ratio (10%) of P3HT-b-PTP leads to a reduced PCE, Jsc and FF, due to the excess of poorly conductive non-conjugated liquid crystalline block.9

When doping P3HT-b-PTP into active layers, the improvement of Jsc and FF can be explained by the dark J–V curves of P3HT:PCBM solar cells with various weight fractions of P3HT-b-PTPafter annealing at 150 °C (Fig. S13†). The reverse saturation current density decreases upon increasing the concentration of P3HT-b-PTP, and the 5% weight fraction of P3HT-b-PTP yields the lowest leakage current. A lower leakage current indicates less charge losses by trapping and recombination, leading to a larger shunt resistance (Rsh) and higher FF.21,51 The Rsh increases from 728.5 Ω cm2 for pristine P3HT:PCBM to 1074.2 Ω cm2 with the addition of 5% P3HT-b-PTP. The series resistance (Rs) of the pristine P3HT:PCBM device is around 8.3 Ω cm2, but reduces to 4.8 Ω cm2 with the incorporation of 5% P3HT-b-PTP, as shown in Table 3. Therefore, the increased Rsh, reduced Rs and leakage currents should be responsible for the improvement of Jsc and FF.
It is widely acknowledged that the conformation and degree of order of the polymer chains in the active layer play crucial roles in charge separation and transport processes.50,52 The self-assembled liquid crystalline block copolymers can induce the crystallinity of P3HT, and cocrystallize with P3HT chains, resulting in a long range crystallinity of P3HT domains and favorable interpenetrating networks. The conformation and level of orientation of the polymer chains can be evaluated from the electronic absorption spectra of the active layers.53 The correlation between the optical properties (UV-vis absorption) and the P3HT-b-PTP fractions of the active layers is highlighted in Fig. 4. The absorption spectra are composed of a high energy region and a low energy region, corresponding to amorphous and crystalline state P3HT chains, respectively.42,54 The P3HT chains are isolated in a flexible coil conformation in the amorphous state P3HT, and linearized π-stacked chains form weakly interacting H-aggregates in the crystalline state P3HT chains.55 In the normalized (normalized to 0–2 vibronic transition absorption) absorption spectra, there are three vibronic peaks A0–2, A0–1 and A0–0 (where the subscripts denote the vibrational quanta coupled to electronic transitions) located at 523, 558 and 608 nm, respectively.43,54 The presence of the vibronic transition peaks and the intensity of the amplitude ratio are associated with the ordering degree of the P3HT chains and the charge carrier mobility.19,43,56 Previous reports indicate that the presence of the peak at 608 nm suggests the strong π–π interaction between P3HT chains and is indicative of a high degree of crystallinity of P3HT.56,57 When increasing the fraction of P3HT-b-PTP from 1% to 5%, the vibronic transition peaks at A0–1 and A0–0 become more pronounced in the absorption spectra. The amplitude ratio of A0–0/A0–1 and A0–0/A0–2 of the active layers with various weight ratios of P3HT-b-PTP are listed in Table 4. The A0–0/A0–1 and A0–0/A0–2 ratios increase with the concentration of P3HT-b-PTP increasing, both of which reach maxima when 5% of P3HT-b-PTP is incorporated into the active layer. The increased A0–0/A0–1 and A0–0/A0–2 ratios imply that a small amount of P3HT-b-PTP could enhance crystallization of P3HT chains. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:PCBM:P3HT-b-Pterph films with various weight ratios of P3HT-b-Pterph after annealing at 175 °C show a similar tendency, as presented in Fig. S14.†

To gain deeper insight into the degree of crystallinity and local intrachain ordering with the fraction ratio of P3HT-b-PTP increasing, the H-aggregate model of Spano et al. was adopted. The free exciton bandwidth (W) within the crystalline phase can be calculated from the intensity ratio (A) of the A0–0 to A0–1 absorbance bands via the relation:42,55  where EP is the vibrational energy of the main intramolecular transition corresponding to a symmetric vinyl stretch (assumed to be 180 eV). The calculated free exciton bandwidth W presented in Table 4 shows that W decreased with increasing the P3HT-b-PTP fraction ratio in the range of 1–5 wt%. According to Clark et al.,58 a decrease in W (manifested in the spectra as an increase in A), assuming similar interchain ordering, would be consistent with an increase in the effective conjugation length (more linearized, better ordered polymer chains). Thereby, the enhanced P3HT chain ordering is found in the P3HT:PCBM:P3HT-b-PTP blends with the P3HT-b-PTP fraction ratio in the range of 1–5 wt%, and the most orderly P3HT chain arrangement is achieved when 5 wt% P3HT-b-PTP is incorporated inducing the spontaneous assembly of liquid crystalline block copolymer P3HT-b-PTP upon liquid crystalline state thermal treatment. This result confirms that the self-assembly of liquid crystalline block copolymer P3HT-b-PTP incorporated into the P3HT:PCBM active layer was involved in improving crystallization and ordering of P3HT chains, thus favoring charge mobility, Jsc, FF and PCE.
In order to gain further insight into the nanomorphology of the active layers and how the orientation of P3HT chains is influenced by various fractions of P3HT-b-PTP after annealing at 150 °C, out-of-plane (qz) grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurement was carried out on the active layers, as depicted in Fig. 5. The diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 5.5°, 10.8° and 16.4° correspond to the (100), (200) and (300) reflections of the lamellae, respectively. In the lamellar-stacking structure of P3HT, alkyl side chains of P3HT are oriented vertical to the substrate to form an edge-on orientation, where P3HT chains along the crystallographic direction are perpendicular to the backbone, and the intermolecular π–π stacking between the thiophene rings is parallel to the substrate, which usually provides the (100) diffraction peak in the out-of-plane (qz) direction.13,21,43,57 The intensity of the P3HT (100) reflection slightly increases with the addition of 5% weight ratio of P3HT-b-PTP, while the value decreases with a higher weight ratio (10%) of P3HT-b-PTP . The increased intensity is demonstrative of an improvement in P3HT crystallinity, which is in accordance with the UV-vis results.

The AFM images of the 5 μm × 5 μm region of the active layers with various fractions of P3HT-b-PTP after annealing at 150 °C are shown in Fig. 6. The RMS roughness of the pristine P3HT:PCBM active layer is 2.9 nm. Incorporation of 1, 3 and 5 wt% of liquid crystalline block copolymer P3HT-b-PTP decreases the RMS roughness of the active layers to 2.6, 2.1 and 1.8 nm, respectively. The active layers with 3 and 5 wt% P3HT-b-PTP show finer nanoscale morphologies than the one with 1% wt% P3HT-b-PTP. This finer nanomorphology can provide good contact between the electrodes and the active layer, resulting in more efficient charge transport, as well as reduced Rs (Table 4), which is correlated to improve Jsc, FF, and PCE.59 Upon further increasing the weight ratio of P3HT-b-PTP to 10 wt%, a rougher surface morphology was observed together with a RMS roughness of 4.3 nm, which may lead to unfavorable conditions for charge separation and transport, thus decreasing the PCE.60 Similar results were also found in the case of the active layer with P3HT-b-Pterph (Fig. S15†).

Facilitated exciton dissociation and charge transfer were examined by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements of the active layers (Fig. 7 and S16†). The PL emission peak of P3HT located at around 640 nm is ascribed to the radiative decay of excitons to the ground state. The PL spectrum intensity is significantly quenched after blending with PCBM. Incorporation of 1–5 wt% P3HT-b-Pterph or P3HT-b-PTP further quenches the PL emission, due to a more efficient exciton dissociation process.50,61 These charge-transfer dynamics were further supported by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) (Fig. 7). The fitted lifetime of the active layers for pristine P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:PCBM with 1, 3, 5, 10 wt% P3HT-b-PTP are 470, 360, 310, 280, 510 ps, respectively. The shorter exciton lifetime of the active layers with P3HT-b-PTP indicates the faster exciton dissociation. The improved charge separation efficiency gives rise to Jsc and photovoltaic performance.

It is well known that the orientation and crystallinity of the P3HT chains could influence the carrier mobility of active layers.62–64 Therefore, the hole and electron transport behaviors of the active layers with and without liquid crystalline block copolymer compatibilizer after annealing at 150 °C were investigated according to the Mott–Gurney space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) law:65,66J = (9/8)με0εr(V2/L3)where J = current density, μ = hole or electron mobility, ε0 = vacuum permittivity, εr = permittivity of active layer, and L = thickness of the active layer. V = Vappl − Vbi − Vr, where Vappl = applied voltage to the device, Vbi = built-in voltage induced by the different work functions of the two electrodes, Vr = voltage drop caused by the series resistance. Fig. 8 shows the hole-only J–V characteristics of the active layers with and without liquid crystalline block copolymer compatibilizer, and the insets show the device architecture and J0.5vs. V plots for Mott–Gurney SCLC fitting. The hole mobility increases with the addition of 1–5 wt% P3HT-b-PTP. The corresponding estimated hole mobility for pristine P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:PCBM with 1, 3, 5, 10 wt% P3HT-b-PTP are 2.16 × 10−8 and 2.97 × 10−8, 2.97 × 10−8, 4.27 × 10−8, 1.63 × 10−8 m2 V−1 s−1 respectively. Similarly, the maximum electron mobility μe = 8.34 × 10−8 m2 V−1 s−1 is achieved with the incorporation of 5 wt% P3HT-b-PTP (Fig. 8). These fitting hole and electron mobility values are summarized in Table 5. The increased hole and electron mobilities are consistent with the improved orientation and crystallinity of the P3HT chains, which is important for the promotion of the photovoltaic performance.

Conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) measurements were employed to determine the electronic conductivities of the active layers. Fig. 9 shows the CAFM current images of the pristine P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:PCBM with 5 wt% P3HT-b-PTP active layers of a 5 μm × 5 μm surface scan area. The mean current of the P3HT:PCBM active layer increases from 12.6 to 26.3 pA after incorporation of 5 wt% liquid crystalline block copolymer compatibilizer. This high electronic conductivity comes from the enhanced orientation and crystallinity of the P3HT chains, which will facilitate charge transport and contribute to the improvement in Jsc and PCE.50,67

4. Conclusions
In summary, the application of P3HT based self-assembled liquid crystalline rod-coil block copolymers P3HT-b-Pterph and P3HT-b-PTP in solar cells has been investigated. Incorporation of the low conductive non-conjugated liquid crystalline block into the copolymers resulted in poor photovoltaic performance of the solar cells based on P3HT-b-Pterph or P3HT-b-PTP blended with PCBM. On the other hand, when the liquid crystalline rod-coil block copolymers were utilized as compatibilizers in P3HT:PCBM blends, the photovoltaic performance of P3HT:PCBM solar cells could be significantly improved at the optimal concentration of liquid crystalline rod-coil block copolymers, especially after annealing from the liquid crystalline states. The self-assembly of liquid crystalline blocks, the molecule–block interaction between P3HT block and P3HT chains and the liquid crystalline copolymer located at the interface of donor and acceptor can induce a long range crystallinity of P3HT domains and the formation of interpenetrating networks, which resulted in the improved charge transport. Overall, using the liquid crystalline block copolymers as compatibilizers in the BHJ provides a promising approach to improve the photovoltaic performance by optimizing the nanomorphology of the active layer.
