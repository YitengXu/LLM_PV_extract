    , Accepted 8th July 2021First published on 8th July 2021AbstractLead halide perovskite quantum dots have drawn worldwide attention due to their quantum confinement effect and excellent optical gain properties. It is worth noting that due to the toxicity of lead ions and the inherent instability of organic groups, research on all-inorganic lead-free metal halide perovskite quantum dots (ILFHPQDs) has become a hot spot in recent years. This paper summarizes the latest research progress of ILFHPQDs, analyzes the sources and limitations affecting the performance of ILFHPQDs, and provides the improvement methods. Firstly, the typical synthesis strategies of ILFHPQDs are discussed, followed by a focus on the structural characteristics, optoelectronic properties and stability of each type of ILFHPQD.

1. Introduction
Within the past two decades, lead halide perovskites (LHPs) (APbX3, A = Cs+, CH3NH3+ (MA+), CH(NH2)2+ (FA+); X = I−, Cl−, and Br−) have drawn worldwide attention due to their impressive optoelectronic properties,1–4 including narrow emission line-widths, extraordinary photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), wide color gamut and highly tunable band gaps across the entire visible spectrum.5–7 Therefore, LHPs have proven to be one of the most promising materials for solar cells (power conversion efficiency (PCE), 29.15%),7–9 light-emitting diodes (LEDs, external quantum efficiencies (EQE), ∼22%),10–12 lasers (low pump thresholds, 5 ± 1 μJ cm−2),13,14 and photodetectors (a large detectivity, 1014 Jones).15
Since the organic–inorganic hybrid LHPs (where A is an organic cation, CH3NH3+ (MA+) and CH(NH2)2+ (FA+)) were successfully synthesized,16 the development of organic–inorganic hybrid LHPs has been unprecedentedly rapid.17–19 Recently, it has been proved that the organic–inorganic hybrid LHPs quantum dots (QDs) exhibit stable and excellent optical gain properties, owing to their quantum confinement effect and unique defect tolerant nature.4,20,21 Unfortunately, it is noteworthy that the organic–inorganic hybrid LHPs are still far from further large-scale commercial or industrial applications due to the toxic nature of Pb ions and intrinsic instability of organic groups.13,22–25
In this context, the all-inorganic lead-free metal halide perovskite quantum dots (ILFHPQDs) can maintain fascinating optoelectronic properties and obtain higher stability by replacing Pb with low-toxic metal elements, which are of great significance for the future use, and offer a wealth of opportunities for researchers to investigate.26,27 Based on the rapid development of this field and the past work in this direction in recent years, it is necessary to summarize the latest research progress of ILFHPQDs and provide researchers with an outlook. In the first section of this review, we discuss the latest typical synthesis strategies of ILFHPQDs. In the second aspect, the structural characteristics, photoelectric properties and stability of ILFHPQDs are reviewed. Then, the applications of ILFHPQDs in various devices are investigated. Finally, insights into the present challenges and prospects of ILFHPQDs are presented.
2. Typical synthesis strategies, structural features, photoelectric properties and stability
For the typical LHPs QDs (APbX3), [PbX6]4− octahedrons were corner connected to form a three-dimensional (3D) framework, and the cavity in the framework is occupied by A-site ion, consisting the highly symmetrical cubic perovskite structure, as shown in Scheme 1.28–30 For the ILFHPQDs, inorganic ions such as Cs and Rb occupy the A position and Pb ions are replaced by other ions such as Sn, Ge, Cu, Ag, Na, Sb, Bi, In.3,31–35Scheme 1 shows the ILFHPQDs can be widely divided into two categories, homovalent substituted halide perovskites and heterovalent substituted halide perovskites, according to the different valence states of the substituted ions. In this section, typical synthesis strategies, structural features, photoelectric properties and stability of ILFHPQDs substituted by different metal ions will be discussed. The ion radii (Å) and electronic configurations of some metal cations substituted for Pb are listed in Table 1.3,36

2.1 Typical synthesis strategies
In the preparation of LHP QDs,1,37–42 several facile strategies have been proved to be applicable to the synthesis of ILFHPQDs, including the hot-injection (HI) strategy,27,31,43–45 ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) strategy35,46–48 and sonication-assisted strategy.49 In this review, the synthesis methods, ligands, optical properties and stability of some ILFHPQDs are summarized in Table 2. Although we have successfully explored the synthesis of ILFHPQDs in the last few years,34,35,48,177 based on a broader scope, it is necessary to systematically study and compare the optical properties of ILFHPQDs under different conditions (synthesis method, ligand, solvent and shape).

In a typical hot-injection strategy, the precursor solution of A-site material (Fig. 1a: cesium oleate) or halide (Fig. 1b: trimethylsilyl chloride or trimethylsilyl bromide) is injected into the solution containing ligand under high temperature and inert gas atmosphere.32,50 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the Cs2AgBiBr6 QDs synthesized by this method showed clear cubic shape and relatively uniform size distribution. The change of injection temperature affected the morphology of the Cs2AgBiBr6 QDs, insoluble precursor impurities BiBr3 appeared at lower temperature, and wide size distribution was displayed at higher temperature (Fig. 1c).43 At the same time, with the increase of reaction time, Cs2SnI6 synthesized by hot-injection strategy gradually changed from QDs to nanorods, nanowires, nanobelts, and finally to nanoplatelets (Fig. 1d).27 By changing the ratio of raw materials, Liu et al. obtained uniform CsSnI3 QDs with different sizes (Fig. 1e), and their emission peak positions also changed.51 In order to obtain suitable ILFHPQDs, it is necessary to adjust the reaction time, temperature, ligand ratio and the ratio of precursors.27,32,43,44,50–54 At the same time, the guidance of detailed theoretical calculations to select the appropriate reaction conditions is also worthy of attention.51

The LARP technique (Fig. 2a) is to directly add the precursor solution into the strongly stirred anti-solvent at room temperature without heating, which is promising for large-scale production of ILFHPQDs.46,47 At the same time, the effects of raw material ratio, reaction temperature, reaction time and ligands (OA, OLAm) on the size, optical properties (Fig. 2b) and aggregation degree of ILFHPQDs also need to be systematically explored.46 The effect of different ligands on the size and shape of Cs2AgBiBr6 QDs can be clearly observed from Fig. 2c, OA ligands affect the yield of the reaction, while OAm ligands play an important role in the size and uniformity of QDs.55 Therefore, the ILFHPQDs with moderate size and uniform morphology may require controlling the ratio of ligands and finding suitable green solvents.56 The optical properties of perovskites can be improved by exploring suitable ligands (Fig. 2d–f) and combining with the inherent characteristics of perovskites to effectively passivate the surface trapped states.57 Thus, the ligand-assisted recrystallization strategy is easy to manipulate without heating and inert gas protection, which is expected to be extended to the synthesis of other ILFHPQDs.

The sonication-assisted method49 was to dissolve the precursor and the ligand (OA) in proper solvent (propylene carbonate) to form the precursor solution. Subsequently, the precursor solution was sonicated at room temperature (Fig. 3a), and the formed Cs3Bi2I9 QDs were homogeneous and well dispersed with an average diameter of 9 nm (Fig. 3b and c). The composition and size distribution of the Cs3Bi2X9 (X = I, Br, Cl) QDs could be controlled by the anion exchange reaction and exchange rate at room temperature. The method is simple, easy to operate and can be applied in mass production applications.

2.2 Structural features, photoelectric properties and stability

2.2.1 Divalent metal cations (Sn, Ge, Eu). 
At the beginning, the approach of homovalent substitution by non-toxic divalent cations (Ge2+, Sn2+) was adopted to obtain the ILFHPQDs (ABX3, A = Rb+, Cs+; B = Ge2+, Sn2+; X = Cl−, Br−, and I−).31,51,59,63,79–81 As members of divalent group 14 elements, tin (Sn) has been explored for the first time due to their non-toxicity. The method of substituting Sn2+ (1.18 Å) for Pb2+ (1.19 Å) with similar ion radius can effectively avoid remarkable lattice perturbation caused by replacement.45,82 Divalent Sn ion is considered to be a favorable substitutive to Pb2+ because of their s2 valence electron configuration, which can meet the prerequisite of coordination and charge balance, and the toxicity of Sn is significantly lower than that of lead.83
The crystal structural features of CsSnX3 QDs synthesized by Sn are shown in Fig. 4a.31,63,78 The grey octahedron corresponds to the [SnX6]4− and the red atoms are the A-site inorganic ions Cs+ in the CsSnX3 QDs. The CsSnCl3 QDs synthesized by Jellicoe et al. in 2016 adopted the Pm3m cubic space group perovskite structure,31 while CsSnI3 QDs and CsSnBr3 QDs existed in the low symmetry Pnma orthorhombic phase. At high temperature, all the compounds were transformed into Pm3m cubic phase.31,84Fig. 4c revealed that the tunable optical band gap of CsSnX3 (X = Cl, Br and I) QDs could be realized from the near-infrared to visible wavelengths region by employing quantum confinement effects and the adjustment of halide composition.31 Two-dimensional (2D) CsSnI3 nanoplates with strong quantum confinement were more likely to form high-density shallow trap states, and the successful preparation of CsSnI3 nanowire arrays with high crystallinity into near-infrared photodetector suggest the need for further studies of their nanomorphology.79,85–87 The charge mobilities of Sn-based perovskites (102 to 103 cm2 V−1 s−1) were higher than that of Pb-based perovskites (10 to 102 cm2 V−1 s−1), and their band gaps were narrower.82 Unfortunately, compared with the PLQY of all-inorganic LHPs up to 90%, the maximum PLQY of all-inorganic Sn2+-based perovskite QDs was a quite low value to be an appropriate alternative.5,31,59 It was recently found that the synthesis conditions of CsSnX3 QDs could be explored in a theoretically guided manner, and PLQY achieved a huge transition from less than 1% to 18.4%. Therefore, the reaction conditions can be suitably selected based on theories such as molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations.51

According to previous reports, it is easy to observe the oxidation process from Sn2+ to Sn4+ in air.31,51,59 Therefore, the structure, properties and applications of Cs2SnX6 (X = Cl, Br and I) have been studied.27,45,54,60–62,78,88Fig. 4b depicted the crystal structure of Sn4+-based perovskite variants Cs2SnCl6, which was a vacancy-ordered double perovskite structure formed by removing the Sn atoms of CsSnCl3 every second layer along (111). In contrast to the unstable CsSnX3 QDs, the Cs2SnX6 QDs were proved to be improved stability under ambient conditions.27 It is worth noting that Cs2SnX6 QDs have been characterized by optical and electronic properties in photovoltaic applications. The Cs2SnI6 QDs were demonstrated to show a weak red emission with a PLQY of 0.48%, the Cs2SnCl6 QDs exhibited blue photoluminescence (Fig. 4d), which was also difficult to compete with LHP QDs in terms of luminescence properties.27,60 Subsequently, the Cs2SnCl6 QDs showed dual PL emission (peak at 438 nm and 615 nm) by doping Sb3+ cations (Fig. 4e), and the PLQY increased from 4.37% to 8.25%.60 Therefore, it is useful and important to introduce dopants (e.g. Sb3+, Bi3+, Mn2+) into Sn4+-based perovskites for improving their stability and optimizing synthesis to enhance their photoelectric properties.88,89
Compared with the larger ion radius of 1.19 Å for Pb2+, the ion radius of Ge2+ is smaller (0.73 Å), and the ionic conductivity of Ge-based perovskites has demonstrated higher.36,90Fig. 5a represented that the higher-temperature phase of CsGeI3 was Pmmm, and the positions of Ge and I atoms were slightly distorted at low temperature, resulting in the rhombohedral space group R3m perovskite structure of CsGeI3 QDs.63 The crystal structure of CsGeI3 remained stable up to 150 °C and no phase transition occurred during low-temperature solution growth.91 CsGeI3 QDs exhibited a PL emission peak (804 nm) and a direct band gap of 1.6 eV (Fig. 5b), which was suitable for photovoltaic applications.63,92 Experimentally CsGeI3-based perovskite solar cells exhibited high photocurrents of 5.7 mA cm−2, but their further development was hindered due to the oxidation tendency and poor film forming ability.91 Although the homovalent alternative method has been successfully confirmed, the extremely rapid and facile oxidation of these divalent ions (Sn2+ to Sn4+, Ge2+ to Ge4+) will lead to instability of these perovskite materials under environmental conditions.93,94 Recently, due to the reports of rare-earth metal ion doping, researchers have turned their attention to ILFHPQDs with rare-earth metal ion as the center ions.65,73,95 The synthesized colloidal CsEuBr3 QDs have a narrow emission linewidth and a high PLQY (39%). However, the photoluminescence of Eu-based ILFHPQDs is closely related to Eu2+, which cannot be varied over a wide emission range. Therefore, the spectral range can be extended by doping with different rare-earth ions.56 Meanwhile, the Eu-based ILFHPQDs are easily affected by oxygen and moisture, and the stability can be well maintained by embedding them in the polymer (Fig. 5c).64 For other ILFHPQDs, which are prone to oxidative decomposition, the encapsulation and other operations are beneficial for their future device applications. It is expected to explore the crystal structural features and properties of ILFHPQDs with the most stable tetravalent ionic state.

2.2.2 Non-toxic broad emitters (Cu, Zn). 
Some ternary compounds of ACu2X3, A3Cu2X5, A2BX4 and A3BX5 (based on Cu+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Mn2+) cannot be classified as perovskites according to the strict definition of perovskites, but they also need to be explored as interesting non-toxic emitters because of their ultra-high PLQY.97–102 Cs2ZnX4 (X4 = Cl4, Cl2Br2 and Cl2I2) QDs with PLQY up to 51.93% and Cu-doped Cs2ZnCl4 QDs were also successfully prepared.99,100 Recently, the synthesis and characterization of 2D all-inorganic Cu-based compounds QDs have been reported,35,96,103–106 and the typical CsCu2Cl3 QDs were CmCm structures. Because the most stable state of copper was the divalent ion state, the Cu-based halide compounds usually adopted Cs2CuCl4 ion stoichiometry with Pnma space group (Fig. 6a).96 In 2018, our team synthesized Cs2CuX4 (X = Cl, Br, Br/I) QDs by LARP method for the first time. The absorption and PL emission of the Cs2CuX4 QDs were tunable (Fig. 6b), and then the adjustable PL emission and different particle size distribution could be obtained by adjusting the ratio of raw materials (Fig. 6c).35 Compared with other ILFHPQDs, the Cs2CuX4 QDs showed up to 51.8% PLQY, longer recombination lifetimes, better stability (Fig. 6d and e), which made them promising for future commercial optoelectronic applications. Subsequently, Cs2Cu3X5 and CsCu2X3 nano-systems102,103 as well as dark blue LEDs,106 optical fiber panels and X-ray detectors105 based on Cs3Cu2I5 QDs were also successfully obtained.104 On this basis, future researchers can continue to explore Cu-based ternary halogen compounds for optoelectronic applications, especially scintillators.

2.2.3 Trivalent metal cation (Bi, Sb). 
In recent years, some researchers have turned their attention to the solution of heterovalent replacement (Bi3+, Sb3+) due to their ns2 electronic configuration similar to Pb2+, and successfully synthesized 2D layered perovskite materials A3B2X9 (A = Rb, Cs; B = Bi, Sb; X = Cl, Br and I) QDs.46,50,66,108–117 Structurally, the charge balance of A3B2X9 QDs crystal structure was achieved by removing every third B-layers of traditional perovskites structure along (111), and the removed B-layers could be regarded as vacancies. The difference of A and X position ions will change the spatial symmetry of A3B2X9 QDs perovskite.108Fig. 7a and b showed that the Cs3Bi2Cl9 QDs adopted monoclinic P21/n symmetry unit cells and the Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs possessed hexagonal Pm1 symmetry crystal structures.46 It is worth noting that previous reports show that Cs3Bi2I9 QDs (Fig. 7c) were dimer phase 0D non perovskite, but Creutz et al. confirmed that Cs3Bi2I9 QDs by anion exchange method present 2D structure.29,46,97,118,178 This shows that the relationship between the structure and properties of perovskite synthesized by different methods needs to be further explored. In addition, color changes could be observed, a tunable absorption and luminescence wavelengths can be obtained by changing the anionic composition of the Cs3Bi2X9 QDs (Fig. 7d and e).107 However, since the absorption peaks of perovskite QDs were consistent with those of the dissolved [BiBr6]3−, the optical data of Bi-based perovskite QDs need to be confirmed by further experiments (such as Raman spectra).58 In 2018, Our team also successfully explored the Cs3Bi2X9 QDs.34 The highly luminescent and stable all-inorganic Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs (PLQY = 22%) were obtained by the combination of OA and octyl ammonium bromide, which was about 100 times as much as that of the ligand-free Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs (PLQY = 0.2%).34,46 The ligand passivated Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs also exhibited excellent stability. The enhanced optical properties were attributed to the passivation of the surface defects by the generated BiOBr (Fig. 7g and h), which indicated that the luminescence mechanism of perovskite needed further systematic study.46,119 Meanwhile, a series of optimization strategies such as composite encapsulation and ion doping can be used to prepare Bi-based perovskite QDs with excellent optical properties and expand their applications in practice.69–74

Similarly, Zhang et al. reported the room temperature synthesis of trivalent antimony ion based Cs3Sb2X9 (X = I, Br or Cl) QDs in 2017.47 The unit cell of the Cs3Sb2Br9 QDs was composed of bioctahedral [Sb2X9]3− surrounded by Cs+, forming a 2D crystal structure of space group Pm1. An improved LARP strategy was used in the synthesis of Cs3Sb2Br9 QDs, that was, the precursor solution was directly injected into a strongly stirred anti-solvent. The Cs3Sb2Br9 QDs prepared by this method were highly crystalline with a PLQY value of 46% at 410 nm. The PL emission peaks could be adjusted from 370 nm to 560 nm by anion exchange reactions (Fig. 7f). At the same time, 70% of the initial PLQY value could be retained after 35 days of aging without encapsulation, 50% of PLQY could be retained after 108 h of continuous ultraviolet irradiation (365 nm, 6 W), and 72% of PLQY can be retained after 108 h of sunlight illumination. It indicated that the Cs3Sb2Br9 QDs owned superior stability.47 Nevertheless, the dimensionality reduction of these trivalent metal cation perovskite materials would lead to the decrease of charge carrier mobilities and deep defects, as well as large band gaps, which thereby reducing its electronic performance.43,47


2.2.4 Tetravalent metal cations (Pd, Zr, Ti). 
In addition to the aforementioned Cs2SnX6 QDs, A2BX6-QDs systems based on Pd4+, Zr4+ and Ti4+ have been recently discovered.67–69,120,121,176 The A2BX6 variant-constructed perovskites QDs could be written as AB0.5X3 QDs, which were composed of isolated [BX6]2− octahedrons. In 2018, Zhou et al. successfully synthesized Cs2PdBr6 QDs by a facile two-step microcrystal-mediated anti-solvent route of dissolving Cs2PdBr6 microcrystals to form a precursor solution, and then prepared Cs2PdI6 QDs by anion exchange method.67 Compared with the microcrystalline powder, the blue shift of Cs2PdBr6 QDs was observed in absorption and PL spectra, which was attributed to the quantum confinement (Fig. 8a and b). At the same time, Cs2PdBr6 QDs had higher photocurrent density (1.2 μA cm−2), which indicated the potential of Cs2PdBr6 QDs as photoelectric materials (Fig. 8c). Ye et al. used a template-free strategy to synthesize hollow nanospheres of Cs2PdBr6 for the detection of trace CO.121 This suggests that future researchers can adopt different synthesis method to change shape and size of ILFHPQDs in order to obtain better performance. In 2020, Zr-based ILFHPQDs Cs2ZrX6 (X = Cl, Br) and their QDs thin films were successfully prepared, which exhibited color-tunable white emission (Fig. 8d and e).68 Subsequently, Liu et al. synthesized Bi3+-doped Zr-based ILFHPQDs, optimized the optical properties, and explored the mechanism of their thermally activated delayed fluorescence (Fig. 8f).69 These works provide an important reference for the fabrication of Cs2ZrX6 QDs into inorganic phosphors and optoelectronic devices. Recently, Grandhi et al. synthesized Cs2TiBr6 QDs for the first time, which can enable third-harmonic generation responses, confirming the potential of ILFHPQDs in nonlinear optical applications.176

2.2.5 Double perovskite. 
Since Slavney et al. reported Cs2BiAgX6 (X = Br, Cl) in 2016, the double perovskite with the formula A2B(I)B(III)X6 (initially known as “elpasolite”) has recently been proved to be a promising ILFHPQD.122,123 Therefore, many recent literature studies have shown that the successful synthesis of a 3D lead-free double perovskite structure A2B+B3+X6 (A = Rb+ or Cs+, B+ = Ag+, Au+, Na+, Cu+, K+, B3+ = Bi3+, Sb3+, Tl3+, In3+ and X = Cl−, Br− or I−) by substituting the divalent lead cation (Pb2+) with a trivalent ion (B3+) and a monovalent ion (B+).33,44,55,124–126 From the point of view of crystal structure, double perovskites can be regarded as the form of doubling the unit-cell dimensions of lead halide perovskite, and the B+ and B3+ cations replacing Pb2+ are arranged alternately. As shown in Fig. 9a, the B+ and B3+ sites in A2B+B3+X6 were occupied by Ag+ and Bi3+ respectively, and these two cations acted as centers to construct [AgBr6]5− and [BiBr6]3− regular octahedrons. The two types of octahedrons were corner connected and arranged alternately to form a 3D framework, with Cs+ occupying the cavities in the framework, consisting the highly symmetrical face-centered cubic double perovskite structure of space group Pmm. According to the work of Xiao et al. in 2017, compared with lead-based perovskite, the lower carrier mobility as well as higher carrier effective mass of halide double perovskite could be explained by electronic dimension rather than the structure size.127 Highly crystalline Cs2BiAgBr6 QDs were synthesized by thermal injection method, which was very similar to the synthesis of LHP QDs. It indicated that the synthesis method of LHP QDs could be extended to double perovskite QDs.32,44 Compared with the bulk materials of double perovskites, the improvement of the absorption and emission properties of these colloidal nanoparticles was possibly due to the quantum size effect.128–130 As shown in the illustration of Fig. 9b, the Cs2BiAgBr6 QDs suspension was bright yellow by naked eye observation, which was obviously optically different from the parent bulk material (orange red). The Cs2BiAgBr6 QDs had a characteristic absorption peak at 430 nm, which was blue shifted by more than 1 eV from the band edge, superficially indicating the quantum confinement effect. The PL excitation spectrum obtained at the 650 nm emission line was consistent with its absorption peak, further demonstrating that the light at the absorption peak was emitted from the QDs (Fig. 9c). Bekenstein et al. interpreted the absorption peak as the metal-centered s–p transition, which was a localized transition.44 This suggests that researchers need more detailed study when they further explore the luminescence mechanism of double perovskite QDs. The structure of Cs2BiAgBr6 QDs synthesized by Zhou et al. could be stable for more than 3 weeks in low polarity solvent, which verified the tolerance of Cs2BiAgBr6 QDs to water, temperature and light.43 In 2019, our research group first prepared Cs2SbAgX6 (X = Cl, Br and I) QDs by LARP method.48 By changing the precursor, PL position could be adjusted from 557 nm to 409 nm (Fig. 9d). The effects of ligands as well as the amount of precursor on the PL intensity were also investigated, and the Cs2SbAgCl6 QDs could reach 31.33% PLQY.48 This indicated that the LARP method could be extended to the synthesis of double perovskite QDs. With the increase of reaction time, the formation of silver particles could be observed in the TEM images of Cs2AgBiBr6 QDs, which was due to the reduction of silver ions by amine ligands (Fig. 9e–g).32,44 Therefore, more attention should be paid to the selection of ligands in the preparation of this kind of perovskites, or to further study the synthesis method of cation exchange with the help of this reaction.131

Although double perovskites displayed enhanced stability, the forbidden band gaps of the double perovskites were usually nonideal, which was an obstacle to achieving excellent photovoltaic performance.132 Hence, it was no surprise that the approach of metal doping was adopted to modify the double perovskites and adjust their band gaps, so as to enhance their optical properties.73,133 On the one hand, some teams focused on doping divalent Mn ions in double perovskite QDs to achieve the regulation of electrical properties.70,134 The original undoped Cs2InAgCl6 QDs exhibited weak white PL emission (Fig. 10a), and the poor PLQY was only 1.6% ± 1%. In contrast, 1.5% Mn-doped Cs2InAgCl6 QDs successfully demonstrated to have bright wide orange PL emission (620 nm) (Fig. 10b) and high PLQY (16 ± 4%). Similar to the previously reported Mn-doped QDs,135,136 the PL emission mechanism of Mn-doped Cs2InAgCl6 QDs was that the energy of the host exciton was transferred to Mn ions, resulting in orange d–d emission.70

On the other hand, the same type of trivalent or monovalent metal doping (such as In3+ and Bi3+, Ag+ and Na+) has also been proved to be effective.71–73,76,137–139,177 The Cs2AgBi1−xInxCl6 (x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 0.9) QDs exhibited bright dual-color emission, orange and violet, corresponding to forbidden transition and direct band-to-band transition, respectively (Fig. 10c).72 The transient PL results showed that the increase of OA led to the higher proportion of radiative recombination, which was the reason for the increased exciton PL. In Cs2BiAgCl6 QDs, indium doping could achieve the transition from indirect band gap to direct band gap, with lower trap states, larger absorption cross section, as well as higher PLQY (36.6%) (Fig. 10d). This suggested that in the future, the tuning of emission colors could be achieved by doping with different ions. Cs2NaBiCl6 QDs doped with different ions (Ag+, Mn2+, Eu3+, Sb3+) have been successfully prepared, and its mechanism has been further explored, which paves the way for future ion-doped ILFHPQDs.73,140,141,177
Recently, the strategy of co-doping multiple ions in perovskites has been reported.74–77,142,143 The Sb/Mn co-doped Cs2NaInCl6 QDs can adjust the intensity ratio of double emission to realize the color change (Fig. 10e).74 The perovskite materials with suitable band gap and emission wavelength can be obtained by finding suitable co dopants and adjusting different doping ratios. The photoelectric performance and stability of the perovskite materials can be improved, which has a potential application prospect in the next generation of lighting equipment.

3. Optoelectronic applications
3.1 Solar cells
Wang et al. fabricated solar cells with a maximum PCE of 5.03% based on CsSnI3 QDs (Fig. 11a–c).80 Compared with non-QDs thin film devices, QDs thin film devices have better performance and stability, indicating that reducing the crystal size to QDs is beneficial for practical solar cells applications.80,81,118,144,145

3.2 Photodetectors
In recent years, photodetectors based on ILFHPQDs have been successfully fabricated.146,147Fig. 12a and b showed the photodetectors made of Cs2SnI6 nanodots, nanorods and nanosheets, respectively, which all had stable photoresponse characteristics and could be repeated over many cycles. The nanorod system possessed the best performance, the highest photocurrent gain value (475) and the shortest photoresponse time (1 s). The reason was that the 1D morphology of nanorod system provided improved carrier migration, which led to its fast and high response characteristics.146 Pradhan et al. fabricated a photodetector based on Cs3Sb2Cl9 nanowires in 2018, which maintained high sensitivity, stable and repeatable performance (Fig. 12c–f).147 Therefore, researchers can explore the development and application of various new photodetectors based on ILFHPQDs in the future.

3.3 Light emitting diodes (LEDs)
The nanosize of QDs can improve the coverage, uniformity and radiative recombination of the nanocrystalline layer by limiting the excitons in the nanocrystalline, which leads to the increase of the current efficiency of LEDs.46,61,148,149 White light emitting diode (W-LED) based on ILFHPQDs (Cs3Bi2Br9) has been successfully confirmed by Leng et al. in 2018.46 As shown in Fig. 13a, there were two emission peaks at 551 nm and 407 nm, corresponding to Y3Al5O12 (YAG) and Cs3Bi2Br9 QDs, respectively. The corresponding output of W-LED were commission international de L'Eclairage (CIE) xy coordinates of (0.29, 0.30) and correlated color temperature (CCT) of 8477.1 K (Fig. 13b), and it displayed satisfactory photostability. Recently, the violet LEDs based on Cs3Sb2Br9 QDs,115,148 Sn2+-based ILFHPQDs near-infrared LEDs and down-conversion color converter films have been successfully prepared. However, the EQE value of the Sn2+-based LEDs is low due to the low quantum yield and leakage current of CsSnI3 QDs (Fig. 13c and d).148 Candlelight LEDs based on Cs2SnBr6 QDs were also constructed by Lai et al. (Fig. 13e and f).61 These reports inspire the researchers to further explore suitable ILFHPQDs for LEDs.

3.4 Photocatalysis
ILFHPQDs could be applied not only in photovoltaic field but also extended to photocatalysis.150–152 Zhou et al. used Cs2BiAgBr6 QDs as environmentally friendly perovskite photocatalysts to photochemically convert CO2 to solar fuels (CH4, CO), displaying an impressive total electron consumption rate.43 The improved photoconversion performance of washed Cs2BiAgBr6 QDs was due to the fact that the organic ligands on the surface of unwashed QDs hindered the transport of photogenerated charges (Fig. 14a), while photoconversion intermediates and products tended to accumulate in the organic ligand shell.153 The Cs2BiAgBr6-based photocatalyst exhibited better humidity, light and thermal stability compared to the previously reported LHP QDs.154 Liu et al. demonstrated that Cs2BiAgBr6 nanoplates can better photocatalyze CO2 reduction compared to nanocubes (Fig. 14b), suggesting that future researchers can enhance their application performance by controlling the morphology.152 Tin based perovskite Cs2SnI6 QDs also formed heterojunction with SnS2 nanosheets, which improved the photocatalytic performance of CO2 reduction by 5.4 times and photoelectrochemical performance by 10.6 times (Fig. 14c).150 Compared with CsPbBr3 QDs, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity based on Cs3Sb2Br9 QDs was higher.116

In addition, ILFHPQDs were used for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, with nitrogen-doped carbon-loaded (N–C) Cs2AgBirBr6 QDs (380 μmol g−1 h−1) having a 19-fold faster hydrogen evolution rate than pure Cs2AgBirBr6 QDs (Fig. 14d and e).151 Therefore, the development and utilization of novel materials compounded with chalcogenide may be promising strategies in the field of photocatalysis. However, some problems, such as the presence of polar solvents and the low utilization of photogenerated charge carriers, can be solved by selecting suitable solvents, washing the surface, and changing the morphology if a greater breakthrough in the field of photocatalysis is desired.152,155 Therefore, the application of ILFHPQDs in the field of photocatalysis can also be tried in the future.
3.5 Field effect transistor (FET) device
Wang et al. synthesized field effect transistor (FET) device based on Cs2SnI6 nanobelt, which exhibited p-type conduction behavior and demonstrated excellent performance (Fig. 15a and b).27 The device displayed high hole mobility (>20 cm2 V−1 s−1) as well as high I-ON/I-OFF ratio (>104) compared to other QDs-based FET devices such as ZnTe, CdSe/ZnS and PbSe.156–158 Because of the unique properties of ILFHPQDs, they could be used as non-toxic and stable raw materials for various memory devices in the future.

4. Conclusion and prospect
Compared to LHP QDs, no alternative material of ILFHPQDs has been found yet that matches all available properties, most of which are relatively stable but have lower PLQY. Although we have made some achievements in the synthesis of ILFHPQDs, their optical properties are still a challenge. The fact that pure undoped ILFHPQDs have indirect bandgaps or direct bandgaps, but with parity forbidden optical transitions, suggests that ILFHPQDs do not readily exhibit good optical performance.159,160 This problem can be effectively overcome by applying different alloying or doping strategies to convert the indirect bandgap into a direct bandgap and improve its PLQY.72,74,142,161 The reason for this is that photogenerated carriers localize to form self-trapped excitons (STEs), and the local symmetry is broken, thus increasing the effective radiative recombination.74,143,162,163 Our team is attempting to synthesize new ILFHPQDs through calculations to determine a viable scheme.
At the same time, another factor affecting the performance of ILFHPQDs is their inherent deep surface defects, which leads to an increased probability of non-radiative recombination.161,164 At present, it is hopeful to solve the disadvantageous factors by surface treatment methods, in which the passivation of surface defects with ligands is the most widely applied.48,107 The suitable ligands can effectively passivate and protect the surface by attaching to the QDs surface and binding to surface dangling bonds, thereby enhancing its PLQY.165 Therefore, it is of great significance to explore more suitable ligands for the preparation of ILFHPQDs. For example, ionic ligands with short carbon chains can be used as halogen sources to replace halogen vacancies on the surface of the ILFHPQDs and bind to the ILFHPQDs, thereby increasing PLQY, or ligands with corresponding “halogen-equivalent” effects can be selected to interact with the exposed central B ion to form a stable binding state, while the exciton trapping probability caused by surface halogen vacancies is effectively eliminated.64,166–168 The mechanism can be further explored by structural characterization, PLQY and PL kinetics before and after passivation.136 Also, the appropriate reaction conditions can be achieved by theoretical guidance.51
In terms of instrumentation conversion, although few applications of ILFHPQDs have been reported, their bulk parent materials or thin film have been demonstrated to be prepared into a variety of devices, such as solar cells,169–171 water detection,172 humidity sensors173 and X-ray detectors.174,175 Based on the above discussion and existing research results, it is reasonable to believe that with further research attempts, ILFHPQDs have the potential to be applied in a variety of future optoelectronic devices. For example, combined with the past application results of our team, we are exploring various potential applications of ILFHPQDs.
This paper reviews the current research status of ILFHPQDs, including synthesis methods, structural characteristics, photoelectric properties, stability, applications and prospects. In conclusion, due to their non-toxicity and stability, ILFHPQDs are powerful candidate materials to replace LHP QDs. However, we should also see that the relationship between the crystal structure and the photoelectric properties of ILFHPQDs has not been studied systematically enough, the current understanding of degradation mechanism is not deep enough, and the application scope is less. Therefore, hopefully this review will inspire the preparation of high performance ILFHPQDs as well as a deeper inquiry into the explanation of their property mechanisms and their application to a broader field. It is also expected that this paper will stimulate the enthusiasm of researchers to explore the interesting property changes in the transformation of perovskites bulk crystals into QDs.
