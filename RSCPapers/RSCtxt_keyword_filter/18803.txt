    , Accepted 1st August 2015First published on 4th August 2015AbstractWe report detailed analysis of the thin film morphology (molecular packing, molecular conformational order, and vertical phase separation) – performance (charge transport, photocurrent generation, and photovoltaic performance) relationships under nanowire formation and subsequent thermal annealing in polymer:fullerene blends. Nanowires of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) are formed by controlled precipitation from solution and blended with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) to form bulk heterojunction thin films. The formation of nanowires and further thermal annealing result in increased molecular order of the P3HT, where the short-range conformational order is maximised by annealing at 100 °C and decreases when annealed at higher temperatures, but the quality of long-range molecular packing and lamellar packing distance increase with annealing temperature up to 150 °C. The long-range order correlates strongly with an increase in hole mobility, but the reduction in short-range conformational order indicates a slight reduction in planarity of the conjugated backbone in this aggregated polymer morphology. Photoconductive atomic force microscopy reveals enhanced connectivity of the hole transporting nanowire network as a result of thermal annealing. Additionally, we find that the nanowire morphology results in a favourable vertical phase separation, with PCBM enrichment at the electron-extracting surface in the conventional architecture, which is contrary to the non-nanowire case. This effect is further encouraged by thermal annealing, resulting in an enhancement of open-circuit voltage, and represents a morphological advantage over conventional P3HT:PCBM devices. Our study identifies an important interplay between long-range and short-range molecular order in charge generation, transport, extraction, and hence solar cell device performance.
1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells are a promising alternative to silicon based technologies due to the potential for low cost solution processing and large area deposition methods. Conjugated polymers have received considerable attention in recent years due to their potential application in plastic electronic devices such as photovoltaic cells. Power conversion efficiencies approaching 9%1 have been achieved with polymer-fullerene blend solar cells utilising the bulk heterojunction concept whereby an electron donor and an electron acceptor are spin cast from a single solvent to form a blend with a large interfacial area.
To achieve high performance in OPV devices requires effective control of the optical and charge transport properties of both blend components (electron donor and electron acceptor), and these factors are intimately related to the morphology of the thin film. Appropriate electronic energy levels and efficient charge transport are crucial for separating the photogenerated excitons and for transporting the resulting charge carriers to their respective electrodes. Among many candidates for donor polymers and acceptor materials, the combination of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rrP3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) continues to be an important and instructive model system. In particular, processing conditions such as thermal2–4 and solvent5 annealing protocols in device fabrication have been used to enhance the device performance. Morphology studies on P3HT:PCBM blend films have revealed in increase in molecular order of the P3HT upon thermal annealing6–8 due to increased phase segregation of P3HT and PCBM, resulting in stronger interactions between polymer chains and an enhanced hole mobility.9,10
Furthermore, recent studies relating to the self-assembly of P3HT nanowires (nwP3HT) through solubility control have shown that highly ordered aggregate structures can be formed with good charge transport properties.11–13 This nanowire form of the conjugated polymer provides a means of controlling the blend film morphology and so is a promising route for enhancing the OPV device performance, and a possible alternative to thermal annealing.14–16
In this study, nanowires are formed in solution through solubility control using dichloromethane, which is a marginal solvent for P3HT but a good solvent for PCBM.11 The P3HT does not fully dissolve at room temperature, but is fully soluble when heated to 60 °C. By gradually cooling the solution to room temperature, the P3HT chains precipitate slowly to form a suspension of nanowires to which a PCBM solution may be added. The formation of P3HT nanowires is driven by controlled intermolecular aggregation of the molecules resulting in enhanced molecular packing and increased charge carrier mobility.11 Despite the large volume of published work regarding P3HT and PCBM blend systems,17–20 detailed studies of nwP3HT considering the morphology of blend films are still lacking. In this work, we investigate a system composed of pre-formed P3HT nanowires blended with PCBM molecules. It is well known that thermal post-annealing (annealing after electrode deposition) significantly improves the device efficiencies of normal P3HT:PCBM solar cells by up to an order of magnitude,21 primarily due to enhanced molecular packing of P3HT.6,22 We study the effect of thermal post-annealing on the nwP3HT:PCBM blend film morphology, in terms of molecular packing, molecular conformation, and vertical phase separation as well as device performance. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) and resonant Raman spectroscopy are used as complementary probes for the thin film morphology. Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and photoconductive atomic force microscopy (PC-AFM) were employed to analyze the device performance of nwP3HT:PCBM blend films as a function of thermal annealing temperature. Finally, we correlate open circuit voltage (Voc) with the vertical phase separation by measuring the surface composition ratio with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
2. Results and discussion
Optical absorption spectra of pristine and thermally annealed (at 150 °C) P3HT:PCBM and nwP3HT:PCBM blend thin films are shown in Fig. 1a. The position of the main absorption peak around 500 nm and the sharpness of the absorption shoulders near 550 and 600 nm are indicators of the degree of energetic disorder within the P3HT component. In this case the vibronic structure is well developed in the nwP3HT:PCBM and annealed P3HT:PCBM films, but absent in the pristine P3HT:PCBM. The latter film also shows an overall blue-shift of the polymer absorption peak from 509 to 480 nm demonstrating that both thermal annealing and nanowire formation result in a reduction in energetic disorder and an increase in effective conjugation length.23Fig. 1b considers small changes in the absorption shoulder at 600 nm for nwP3HT:PCBM films resulting from thermal annealing at temperatures up to 180 °C. The relative strength of this shoulder increases with annealing temperature up to 120 °C but decreases at higher temperatures, as shown in the inset. This shoulder is particularly associated with well-ordered P3HT and so indicates that annealing temperatures up to 120 °C are beneficial to molecular order, but higher temperatures are detrimental.24 However, more detailed characterisation can be achieved using X-ray diffraction and resonant Raman spectroscopy, which are powerful complementary techniques for considering the long-range molecular packing, and short-range molecular conformation respectively, both of which are forms of molecular order.

2.1 Molecular packing
GI-XRD (α = 0.18°) specifically probes the ordered polymer component and Fig. 2a compares the scattering peak measured for nwP3HT:PCBM films annealed at temperatures up to 150 °C. This scattering peak lies at around 2θ = 5.5° and corresponds with the lamellar lattice spacing (100) of the P3HT. Fig. 2b plots the variation in the position (in terms of lamellar spacing) and width (FWHM) of this peak for different annealing temperatures. In the pristine film, the peak scattering intensity is measured for a lattice spacing of 15.64 Å, which increases with annealing temperature up to 16.04 Å when annealed at 150 °C. This increase in lattice spacing is accompanied by a reduction in the FWHM of the scattering peak, indicating a simultaneous increase in the quality of molecular packing. This change in the packing structure is similar to those reported for solvent annealing,25 and we interpret them to indicate that the alkyl side chains of the P3HT adopt a collapsed conformation during deposition, possibly as a result of the use of a marginal solvent to form the nanowires.26 During thermal annealing, the molecules are able to adopt the more thermodynamically stable conformation with extended alkyl side chains, resulting in increased lamellar spacing, and a longer crystallite coherence length.

2.2 Molecular conformational order
In addition to the enhancement of the P3HT molecular packing, we are also interested in the conformational order of the conjugated polymer backbone. These two factors are intimately related but distinct from one another.27 Resonant Raman spectroscopy is a powerful structural probe for the molecular conformational order of conjugated polymers, and has the advantage over XRD of being sensitive to both ordered and disordered phases allowing a quantitative analysis of these phases.28,29 Comparing results from XRD and resonant Raman spectroscopy enables us to build a more detailed understanding of the different length-scale molecular orders in the film and thus to unveil how these factors relate to the photovoltaic operation of the device. By measuring the Raman spectrum of the thin film samples using a 488 nm laser excitation, which matches with the high energy part of the main P3HT absorption band, we obtain selectively enhanced Raman scattering from the disordered, high energy phase of the polymer, and are able to estimate the degree of molecular order.28Fig. 3a shows the part of the measured Raman spectra corresponding with collective bond stretching modes of the conjugated polymer backbone. In particular, the strong mode at 1445–1475 cm−1 is the CC symmetric ring stretch, and the smaller mode at 1380 cm−1 is the stretching mode of the C–C bond in the thiophene ring. These vibrational modes are very sensitive to the planarity of the P3HT conjugated backbone, and so are a powerful means of probing the short-range molecular conformation. This sensitivity is demonstrated by the comparison of different samples in Fig. 3a: the spectra for regiorandom P3HT (rraP3HT) and regioregular P3HT (rrP3HT) act as reference samples for amorphous, and highly ordered phases of P3HT. An increase in molecular order results in a shift of the main CC peak to lower vibrational energy (from 1472 to 1447 cm−1 for rraP3HT and rrP3HT respectively), as well as a narrowing of this peak width and an increase in the relative intensity of the C–C peak. Comparing the P3HT:PCBM and nwP3HT:PCBM blend films with these reference samples, we clearly see that the P3HT in the P3HT:PCBM blend is much more disordered than the neat film, whereas the nanowire P3HT retains a high degree of molecular order in the nwP3HT:PCBM blend. This shows that the nanowire formation is an effective means of preserving highly ordered P3HT within a blend film.30

(b) Comparison of the CC symmetric stretching mode peak (∼1450 cm−1) measured for pristine and thermally annealed nwP3HT:PCBM thin films for temperatures up to 180 °C. (c) Plot of composition ratio of the ordered P3HT phase (% relative to rrP3HT) in P3HT:PCBM and nwP3HT:PCBM against annealing temperature. 

Fig. 3b considers the changes in the shape of the main CC Raman peak of nwP3HT:PCBM samples as a function of thermal annealing temperature. In this case, we can see variation in the 1460–1480 cm−1 contribution to the Raman scattering, which corresponds with the disordered phase. The pristine nwP3HT:PCBM shows the strongest contribution from the disordered polymer phase, and this decreases with annealing temperature up to 100 °C, but slightly increases at higher temperatures. A quantitative comparison of the composition of the P3HT relative to the rrP3HT reference film for each of the blend films, using the method described elsewhere, is given by Fig. 3c.28 In the pristine films, we find that the P3HT:PCBM film has ∼44% ordered polymer, and the nwP3HT:PCBM has ∼88% ordered polymer. The proportion of ordered material increases after thermal annealing, reaching a maximum of ∼85% for P3HT:PCBM annealed at 150 °C, and a maximum of ∼97% for nwP3HT:PCBM at 100 °C. Annealing at higher temperatures slightly reduces the proportion of the ordered phase. We note that the maximum degree of conformational molecular order is highest for the nwP3HT:PCBM film, and is also achieved at a lower annealing temperature than for P3HT:PCBM.
2.3 Charge transport
The GI-XRD characterisation of the nwP3HT:PCBM film showed a continuous increase in lamellar spacing and crystallite coherence length up to 150 °C, whereas the Raman spectroscopy shows a maximum of conformational order at 100 °C followed by a reduction when annealed at higher temperatures. This observation highlights the difference between these two characterisation techniques and relates to the fact that XRD is insensitive to disordered polymer. We suggest that thermal annealing above 100 °C results in a reduction of the proportion of ordered polymer in the blend film sample, but that the quality of long-range molecular packing in the ordered phase continues to increase. A possible mechanism of this effect would be the diffusion of PCBM into the polymer phase at these temperatures causing molecular level disruption of the ordered material, but if the PCBM molecules are unable to penetrate the nanowire aggregates themselves, then these would be preserved as high quality crystallites, which continue to relax into a more thermodynamically stable packing structure. The resulting morphology contains both an increased proportion of the mixed polymer/fullerene phase, as well as a network of highly ordered polymer nanowires.
The quality of this nanowire morphology within the blend film as a charge transporting network is assessed by measuring the hole mobility of these samples in a hole-only diode architecture using the space-charge limited current method. These results are given in Table 1, and show the same trend as the GI-XRD data, with a steady increase in mobility from 7.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the pristine nwP3HT:PCBM with increasing annealing temperature up to 2.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 when annealed at 150 °C. This arises because the hole mobility is mainly controlled by the molecular packing structure to which XRD is also sensitive, and clearly shows that the increase in quality of molecular packing associated with thermal annealing is beneficial for charge transport.

2.4 Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performance of polymer:fullerene blend films shows complex dependences on the morphological properties, which we have characterised above in terms of the polymer molecular order. In order to understand these relationships, it is important to compare these morphological analyses with device performance characteristics. Current density-voltage curves are plotted for P3HT:PCBM and nwP3HT:PCBM films annealed at different temperatures in Fig. 4, along with the device performance parameters: open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE), which are also given in Table 2. Both P3HT:PCBM and nwP3HT:PCBM devices show a significant increase in PCE with annealing temperature up to 150 °C giving optimum efficiencies of ∼3.2% in both cases (Fig. 4f). However, the nwP3HT:PCBM blend gives higher efficiencies in pristine films and when annealed at lower temperatures, compared to P3HT:PCBM blend. The trends in Jsc as a function of annealing temperature are also different in the two cases, with the nwP3HT:PCBM reaching a maximum at 100 °C, but the P3HT:PCBM continuing to increase up to 150 °C (Fig. 4d). This resembles the trends shown in Fig. 3c comparing the composition ratio of conformationally ordered polymer, and indicates that the proportion of ordered material is more important for photocurrent generation than the quality of molecular packing (see Fig. 2b), which is more important for charge mobility.

One striking difference in the performance characteristics of the P3HT:PCBM and nwP3HT:PCBM blend devices is that Voc increases with annealing temperature for nwP3HT:PCBM but decreases for P3HT:PCBM (Fig. 4c). Voc is related to a variety of factors, but the reversal of the trend for these two cases suggests significant differences in the vertical phase separation and the formation of shunt connections, which can result in low voltages. We compare the degree of vertical phase separation in these films using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
2.5 Vertical phase separation
XPS offers quantitative elemental analysis of the surface with some degree of vertical resolution available through changing the take-off angle of the beam and detector (take-off angle measured from the surface of the sample). Since P3HT contains sulfur and PCBM does not, we use of the intensity of the S 2p spectra to quantify the proportion of P3HT at the top surface using neat P3HT and nwP3HT films as references. The XPS data comparing the S 2p spectra (S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2) of the pristine and annealed (150 °C) P3HT:PCBM and nwP3HT:PCBM blend films are shown in Fig. 5 for take-off angles of 90° and 30° corresponding to penetration depths of ∼7.5 and ∼3.8 nm respectively. The elemental proportions are given in Table 3, including the calculated relative volume of P3HT. These results show that the top surface of the pristine P3HT:PCBM film contains 77% P3HT within the first ∼7.5 nm, and after thermal annealing at 150 °C this increases to 88%. In both cases the measurement with 30° take-off angle shows a further enrichment of P3HT in the top ∼3.8 nm. This reveals that the P3HT:PCBM film top surface comprises mainly P3HT and this enrichment reduces below the surface, we also find that thermal annealing increases this effect, in agreement with other reported results.23 By contrast, the pristine nwP3HT:PCBM has a much lower proportion of P3HT in the top ∼7.5 nm of ∼54%, which further reduces to ∼42% after annealing. Measurements at 30° take-off angle show that the pristine nwP3HT:PCBM film has some composition gradient with increased P3HT proportion at the top surface, but this is not present after annealing. These observations reveal that the formation of P3HT nanowires profoundly affects the vertical phase separation of the blend film, not only resulting in a reduced P3HT composition at the top surface, but also reversing the impact of thermal annealing on the surface composition such that the annealed film has a further reduced P3HT component at the surface. Since the top surface is connected to the low work function electron-extracting electrode in the completed devices we expect a high P3HT composition to be unfavourable for device performance because it limits the contact area with the electron-transporting PCBM and can also form shunt connections more easily. These results are able to explain the increase of Voc with annealing temperature for nwP3HT:PCBM and the reverse trend for P3HT:PCBM.

Vertical phase separation is controlled by a combination of surface energy, crystallisation, and molecular diffusion effects.31,32 In this case, the materials are unchanged so surface energy effects are not expected to be relevant. The primary difference between the nwP3HT:PCBM and P3HT:PCBM films is the morphology of the polymer nanowires and we suggest that this is the cause for the different behaviour, but it is not yet clear how this results in a reduced preference for the nwP3HT to accumulate at the top surface. We suggest that the physically larger nanowire domains permit more space for the PCBM molecules to diffuse and form large aggregates, and note that a similar effect has been observed for blends of P3HT nanowires with low molecular weight polymers.18,30,33 Regardless of the mechanism, this tendency of the nanowires to result in a favourable vertical phase separation is a useful means of achieving high Voc values and so gaining a more detailed understanding would be worthwhile.
2.6 Photocurrent generation
The above discussion related primarily to the trends observed in Voc for the different devices, but it is instructive to also consider the trends in Jsc. This can be achieved by measuring the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum, as shown in Fig. 6a for nwP3HT:PCBM films annealed at different temperatures. The 300–400 nm part of these spectra represents the contribution to the photocurrent from the PCBM absorption, and the larger 400–650 nm contribution arises from P3HT absorption. As the annealing temperature increases, the P3HT contribution grows showing that the increase in polymer order (see above) results in an enhanced photocurrent. Additionally, we employed transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) to distinguish whether the differences in the measured Jsc (Fig. 4d) arise from variation in the efficiencies of charge separation or charge collection. We have recently shown that monitoring the optical absorption of photogenerated charges can provide a powerful probe of the yield and recombination of dissociated charges in blend films, and their efficiency of charge separation.34–36 In all of the cases measured here the transient absorption signals exhibited micro- to millisecond power law (ΔOD ∝ t−α) behaviour consistent with their assignment to long-lived, dissociated radical ions. Fig. 6b shows the comparison of transient absorption data for P3HT:PCBM and nwP3HT:PCBM blend films before and after annealing at 150 °C. In all cases power law, oxygen insensitive dynamics were observed, consistent with the assignment of the transient absorption to dissociated polarons – typical of those we have reported previously and characteristic of non-geminate recombination of dissociated polarons in the presence of an exponential distribution of localised states.37 It is apparent that there is no notable difference in the initial signal amplitude (measured at the P3HT cation absorption maximum of 980 nm). However, the signals exhibit different recombination rates, in the order: annealed P3HT:PCBM blend (consistent with our previous study of annealed vs. non-annealed P3HT:PCBM blend films38) < annealed nwP3HT:PCBM < pristine nwP3HT:PCBM < pristine P3HT:PCBM. The recombination rates for the films and the signal at 1 μs (corresponding to the time scale of charge extraction39) are in good agreement with the trend in Jsc values observed in devices, and suggests that the changes in Jsc results from changes in charge collection (due to formation of different domain size and purity). This could explain why the annealed P3HT:PCBM blend film has a higher Jsc than the annealed nwP3HT:PCBM blend film even though the annealed nwP3HT:PCBM film has a higher degree of molecular order. We note that the signal amplitude has already been corrected for changes in ground-state absorbance at the excitation wavelength (which were small for the 520 nm pump wavelength employed). Furthermore, it should be noted that the amplitudes of observed decay transients vary approximately linearly with excitation density, indicating that saturation effects do not distort this comparison. We can therefore conclude that the observed increase in ΔOD signal amplitude cannot be attributed to enhanced light absorption. The variation in transient absorption signals for the studied films observed on a microsecond time scale is therefore assigned to changes in the collection of dissociated charges.

(b) Transient absorption characteristics for pristine and thermally annealed (150 °C) films of P3HT:PCBM and nwP3HT:PCBM, obtained using 10 μJ cm−2 excitation at 520 nm and measuring the optical density with a 970 nm probe wavelength. 
Laterally resolved mapping of the photocurrent can be achieved using photoconductive-atomic force microscopy (PC-AFM), the results of which are shown in Fig. 7 for pristine and annealed (150 °C) nwP3HT:PCBM films. This technique simultaneously maps the surface height of the film and the photocurrent measured by the tip at each point. The surface height maps of the two films (a and c) show no clear difference, but the photocurrent maps (b and d) clearly show the nanowire structures as areas of high current. After thermal annealing the overall magnitudes of the currents have slightly increased and the apparent density of nanowires is greater. It is known that PC-AFM is sensitive to sub-surface features so this observation is compatible with the earlier results showing a reduced component of P3HT at the top surface of the film.40 The increased density of nanowires after annealing could either indicate the additional formation of nanowires during annealing, or may indicate an improvement in electrical connectivity of pre-existing nanowires. In either case, this corresponds with the measured enhancement in hole mobility (see above).41,42

3. Experimental
Regioregular P3HT (Mn = 37k, Mw/Mn = 2.0, RR = 90–93%), regiorandom P3HT (1:1 head-to-head:tail-to-tail, Mw ∼ 87 kg mol−1) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and PCBM (99.5% purity) from Nano-C Inc. All materials were used as received without further purification. nwP3HT:PCBM blend solution was made using dichloromethane using the method described previously.9 P3HT:PCBM solution (1:1 by weight ratio) was blended in DCM at a concentration of 4 mg mL−1 at above 50 °C with a tight-fitting cap, and the solution was cooled down to room temperature very slowly whilst being stirred.
Solar cell devices were prepared with the structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS(30 nm)/P3HT:PCBM(100 nm)/Ca(20 nm)/Al(100 nm). Samples were fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated substrates. After sequential cleaning of the ITO with detergent (Mucasol), acetone and isopropyl alcohol, a layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS, Baytron P TP AI 4083, Bayer AG) was spin coated on the ITO with a thickness of 30 nm and baked at 120 °C for 30 min. P3HT:PCBM blend solution was spin coated onto the PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrate (1000 rpm, 1 min). After spin coating the active layers, films were thermally treated at various temperatures (80–150 °C). For the device performance measurements of OPV devices, a Ca(20 nm)/Al(100 nm) cathode was thermally deposited. Hole-only devices were fabricated with the PEDOT:PSS/Au electrode as bottom/top contact respectively to measure the hole mobility of the bulk film. The applied bias was corrected for the internal built-in voltage, and mobility values were extracted from the region above the trap filled limit (>1 V) based on SCLC behaviour characterised by the Mott–Gurney square law.43,44 At least six devices are used to get an average value for the hole mobilities and individual parameters of solar cell performance including overall PCE. Electrical characteristics of these films were measured using Keithley 236 source/measure units in the dark and under AM 1.5 solar illumination (Oriel 300 W solar simulator) at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. All electrical measurements of OPVs were performed under a N2 atmosphere.
UV-visible absorption spectra were measured using UV-visible (UV 2500, Shimadzu). The grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction measurements were performed at the 9 C beam line in Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) with an incidence angle of 0.18°. Ultraviolet and angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, XPS) measurements were performed with an Axis Ultra DLD system (Kratos Analytical Ltd.). Raman spectra were recorded using a Renishaw inVia microspectrometer with 488 nm Argon ion laser excitation (0.01 mW, acquisition time of 10–20 s). To avoid film degradation, the beam was defocussed to ∼8 μm diameter. The spectra were background corrected with polynomial fitting and spectra were averaged over three different regions. The spectra at three different regions were very similar indicating the reproducibility of the results.
PC-AFM was performed on an Asylum Research MFP-3D mounted on top of an inverted microscope, using 0.2 Nm−1 Cr/Au coated tips (Budget Sensors) under inert atmosphere (N2) with an applied forward bias of 0.5 V. A 532 nm laser beam was used through a 50× microscope objective to form a 100 micrometer diameter spot on the active layer (power density ∼6600 W m−2). 532 nm was chosen to match the absorption of P3HT.
Transient absorption decays were measured by exciting the sample film, under a nitrogen atmosphere, pumped with a Nd:YAG laser (Quantel, Big Sky Laser). The excitation wavelength used was 520 nm, with a pump intensity of 0.7–75 μJ cm−2 and a repetition frequency of 4 Hz. A 100 W quartz halogen lamp (Bentham, IL 1) with a stabilised power supply (Bentham, 605) was used as a probe light source, with a pump wavelength of 970 nm used. The probe light passing through the sample film was detected with a silicon photodiode (Hamamatsu Photonics, S1722-01). The signal from the photodiode was pre-amplified and sent to the main amplification system with an electronic band-pass filter (Costronics Electronics). The amplified signal was collected with a digital oscilloscope (Tektronics, TDS220), which was synchronised with a trigger signal of the pump laser pulse from a photodiode (Thorlabs Inc., DET210). To reduce stray light, scattered light and sample emission, two monochromators and appropriate optical cut-off filters were placed before and after the sample.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have observed the effects of nanowire formation and subsequent thermal annealing on P3HT:PCBM blends and correlated them with changes in the thin film morphology (molecular packing, molecular conformational order, and vertical phase separation) and performance (charge transport, photocurrent generation, and photovoltaic performance). We find that P3HT nanowires formed in solution preserve a higher degree of molecular order in the blend film than non-nanowire P3HT, resulting in enhanced device efficiency without the need for post-deposition annealing. Subsequent thermal annealing yields a further increase in photovoltaic performance, which we relate to the thin film morphology. We observe that the lamellar lattice spacing of the nwP3HT domains increases during thermal annealing as the alkyl side chains extend to a thermodynamically favourable state. This corresponds with an increase in the conformational molecular order of the polymer at low temperatures (<100 °C), whilst at higher temperatures (100–150 °C), a decrease in the proportion of ordered material indicates that there is a simultaneous disruption of some ordered polymer accompanied by continued enhancement of the molecular packing in other parts. The enhanced molecular packing results in an increase in hole mobility of the films, and an overall increase in device efficiency identified particularly with an increased charge generation efficiency. Characterisation of the surface composition shows a profound difference in the vertical phase separation arising from the formation of nanowire aggregates, whereby the nanowire morphology results in a low proportion of P3HT at the surface, which minimises shunt connections and gives high output voltage solar cells.
