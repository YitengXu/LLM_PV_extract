    , Accepted 26th April 2017First published on 26th April 2017AbstractThe electron transport layer (ETL), which also serves as the hole-blocking layer, is a key component in planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The commonly used ETL is an anatase-TiO2 (an-TiO2) film due to its excellent optical transmittance, chemical stability and semiconducting characteristics. Nevertheless, its rough surface and plenty of surface defects often lead to a substandard perovskite film and large J–V hysteresis. Herein, a novel low-trap-density ETL is developed by surface modification of the an-TiO2 film using small-molecular ITIC. As a result, the device efficiency has been dramatically increased from 17.12% to 20.08%, entering the league of the highest planar-type perovskite cells. Moreover, the J–V hysteresis has been significantly reduced. Further investigation shows that the ITIC smoothens the TiO2 surface, passivates defects or dangling bands parasitizing the TiO2 surface, and optimizes the device band alignment. In addition, it is demonstrated that the thin ITIC promotes the formation of high quality, uniform perovskite films with better surface coverage and large grain size, implying that there is a synergistic effect between the low-trap-density ITIC and high-mobility TiO2 in improved PSC performance.
Introduction
The organic–inorganic perovskite materials are promising candidates for a new class of solar cells due to their strong light absorption, weakly bound excitons, long-range charge carrier diffusion and apparent tolerance to defects.1–3 They can be fabricated conveniently at low cost using atmospheric solution processes. In addition, their optical band gaps can be easily adjusted through elemental substitution.4–6 In fact, the solar cell efficiency has been rapidly increased from 3.8% to 22.1% in just a few years.7–9 Hence, perovskite has made it known as one of the top candidates for the next generation of photovoltaic materials.10–12
The electron transport layer (ETL), also functioning as a hole-blocking layer, is a key component in high-efficiency planar PSCs.13 The most popular ETL for planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is an anatase-TiO2 film due to its excellent optical transmittance, high conductivity and superior chemical stability at high temperature in air.14,15 Meanwhile, the work function of the an-TiO2 is −4.01 eV, and the conduction band of the perovskite is −3.80 eV, the energy offset is sufficient for electron extraction from the perovskite to the TiO2 layer.16 Nevertheless, its rough surface and large number of surface defects lead to a substandard perovskite film and large current density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis.17 As a result, the an-TiO2 ETL-based PSCs often show lower than the desired photoelectric conversion efficiencies (PCE) and the notorious photocurrent J–V hysteresis often exists in PSCs when measured under different scan directions, making accurate efficiency determination challenging.18,19 As an alternative approach, an effective way that has been proposed to circumvent this challenge is either to modify the surface (using organic materials20,21 or carbon16) or improve the quality of the TiO2 film.22–25 As a result, the PCE of TiO2 ETL-based planar perovskite solar cells has reached to ∼19% recently. However, it remains challenging to develop a more effective TiO2 ETL to enhance planar perovskite solar cell performances.
In this work, an ultrathin ITIC layer was first applied on the TiO2 film as an ETL to enhance the device performance. Here, ITIC is a novel electron acceptor based on a bulky seven-ring fused core (indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene, IT), end-capped with 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (INCN) groups, and with four 4-hexylphenyl groups substituted on it. Each INCN has one carbonyl and two cyano groups, and these electron-withdrawing groups can downshift LUMO levels. As a result, ITIC possesses low LUMO energy levels, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and good electron transport ability.26,27 It is demonstrated that the thin ITIC layer affects the formation of high quality, uniform perovskite films with large grain size. In addition, it is found that the thin ITIC coating not only smoothens the TiO2 surface for improving perovskite deposition and passivating the TiO2 surface defects, but it also optimizes device band alignment. Using the approach, solar cell efficiency is improved to as high as 20.08%, moreover, the J–V hysteresis is reduced significantly. We attribute this outstanding performance to improved conductivity, reduced contact resistance, a well matched work function and decreased trap-state density as achieved by the ITIC surface modification.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a illustrates the completed device architecture (FTO/TiO2/ITIC/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au) and its cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) image, note that an ultrathin ITIC was inserted between the TiO2 ETL and the perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) layer. Fig. 1b displays the energy-level diagram of the device. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to measure the work function of both TiO2 and TiO2 coated with ITIC (shown in Fig. 4b). The work function (WF) of the bare FTO/TiO2 is −4.01 eV.28 When the TiO2 is coated with ITIC, its WF decreases to −3.84 eV. The energy level alignment indicates that the lower WF of the ITIC-coated TiO2 between the cathode and the perovskite absorber can extend the distance between the electrons and the holes and effectively suppress the electron transport from the ETL back to the perovskite absorber, facilitating more efficient electron transport and collection.21,29Fig. 1c shows the absorption spectrum and molecular structure of the ITIC. The other properties (chemical, physical and electrical) of ITIC are shown in Fig. S1.†

For device optimization, various ITIC concentrations (dissolved in chlorobenzene) have been tested, measured and labeled 0.1 mg ml−1, 0.2 mg ml−1, 0.5 mg ml−1 and 1 mg ml−1, respectively, to optimize ITIC coverage on the TiO2 film. As shown in Fig. S2,† the water contact angle on TiO2 is 50.9° and it is slightly increased to 90.3° as the ITIC concentration is increased to 1 mg ml−1, equivalent to that of the pristine ITIC film. As both the perovskite and its solvent are highly polar, the improved contact angle is expected to help disperse the solution better on the modified TiO2 surface to form a more uniform pinhole-free continuous film.30,31 In our study, we use AM 1.5 illumination (1 min AM 1.5 illumination) to pre-illuminate the device and then performed various measurements. Without the pre-illumination various curves were actually seriously distorted, similar to other reports.32,33Fig. 2a and b show the J–V curves and EQE spectra fabricated with different ITIC concentrations used for various ITIC surface coverage samples on the TiO2 film, with the key photovoltaic parameters summarized in Table 1.

The device with bare TiO2 (without ITIC) delivers a PCE of 17.12%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.08 V, a JSC of 21.67 mA cm−2, and an FF of 73.2%. It is clear that the ITIC-modified TiO2 layer dramatically enhances the device performance. As soon as a small amount of ITIC (0.1 mg ml−1) is used, the device performance is improved significantly to a PCE of 18.36%, with the corresponding VOC, JSC, and FF to 1.11 V, 22.14 mA cm−2, and 74.7%, respectively. When 0.2 mg ml−1 ITIC was used, the device exhibits an optimized PCE of 20.08%, with a VOC of 1.12 V, a JSC of 22.71 mA cm−2, and an FF of 79.0%. The JSC was improved substantially and a similar trend was also observed in the FF and VOC. The enhanced FF and VOC are likely achieved by suppressing charge recombination, usually limiting the device efficiency. Moreover, the device band alignment is optimized for improved VOC through quasi-Fermi level shifting,34 and therefore the PCE is increased by 17.3%. In addition, as shown in Table 1, the series resistance (Rs) of the device is reduced while the shunt resistance (Rsh) is increased by the ITIC modification, as the ITIC coverage would decrease the surface trap states of the TiO2, leading to more efficient electron extraction and transport.35
When the ITIC concentration is further increased beyond 0.2 mg ml−1, the device performance starts to degrade. For example, when 0.5 mg ml−1 is used, the VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE are 1.13 V, 22.60 mA cm−2, 74.2%, and 18.89%, respectively, when it is further increased to 1 mg ml−1, the device performance rapidly dropped to 1.08 V, 19.87 mA cm−2, 70.5%, and 16.19%, respectively. The pure ITIC ETL-based device is also tested and shown in Fig. S3† with a corresponding VOC, JSC, FF, PCE, Rs and Rsh of 1.01 V, 19.94 mA cm−2, 56.7%, 11.41%, 29.35 Ω cm2 and 1080 Ω cm2, respectively. Fig. S4† shows the conductivity measurement of the TiO2 and the ITIC films. As expected, the conductivity of the TiO2 film is significantly larger than that of the ITIC film. Hence, a thin layer of ITIC would passivate the trap states on the TiO2 surface, while a thick ITIC film would lower electron conductivity and hence device performance. It should be noted that the UV-vis analysis of ITIC films before and after DMSO and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) mixed solvent (3:7 v/v) treatment are compared in Fig. S5† which proved that the ITIC film is strongly adhered to the TiO2 film. In addition, small performance fluctuations are observed in 20 devices (seen in Table 1) fabricated using an identical procedure, demonstrating good reproducibility.

Fig. 2b shows EQE spectra, confirming the J–V measurements that the highest EQE is achieved using the optimal ITIC concentration while the device without ITIC and those using too much ITIC gave lower EQE response. Compared with the device without the ITIC, the EQE of the devices using the ITIC modification is enhanced dramatically with the integrated JSC improved to 22.71 mA cm−2, which is significantly higher than 21.67 mA cm−2 attained using the bare TiO2. It should be noted that JSC calculated using the EQE curves are consistent with the J–V measurements (errors less than 5%), indicating that the latter is well calibrated.36
The physical structure of the component layers plays an important role in device performance.37Fig. 3a and b show the top-view SEM images of the bare TiO2 and ITIC-(0.2 mg ml−1) coated TiO2. Grain boundaries and voids can be clearly identified on the bare TiO2 sample surface. In comparison, there is no such type of defects observed on the ITIC-coated TiO2 sample. Moreover, the coating made the TiO2 surface much smoother. Fig. 3c and d provide SEM images of perovskite films fabricated on the bare and ITIC-coated TiO2. More uniform perovskite films with larger grain size and fewer voids are attained on the ITIC-coated TiO2. This is also confirmed by the corresponding atomic force microscopy (AFM) images shown in Fig. 3e and f, in which the root mean square (RMS) roughness is reduced effectively from 6.56 nm to 4.9 nm. It is recognized that a smoother surface promotes better perovskite deposition, especially when the perovskite layer is deposited using solution deposition processes.38 Hence, it is expected that more uniform coverage of the perovskite film is realized on the ITIC-modified TiO2 surface (Fig. 3g and h) with large grain size that is desirable for efficient light absorption and charge transport. In addition, the compact perovskite film also prohibits the shunt paths generated from direct contact between the ETL and the hole-transport layer (HTL).39 Therefore, the ITIC-modified TiO2 ETL is beneficial for high performance perovskite solar cells.

Even though there is only an ultrathin layer of ITIC on the TiO2 surface, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that there is indeed a detectable layer of ITIC present on the TiO2 surface. As shown in Fig. 4a, the characteristic peaks of ITIC, N1s, S2s, and S2p, attributed to its nitrogen and sulfur moieties, are resolved at around 400 eV, 229 eV and 165 eV, respectively, demonstrating that the ITIC is indeed detected on the TiO2 surface. UPS is used to determine the work function (EF) of TiO2 and TiO2/ITIC films.40 The measured EF of the TiO2 film is −4.01 eV, and that of the TiO2/ITIC film is −3.84 eV (Fig. 4b). The lower work function of the TiO2/ITIC film indicates that the vacuum level is pulled down to 170 meV by putting ITIC on the TiO2 surface. The difference between EF values means that ITIC induced obvious band bending of the TiO2 layer, hence producing an extra built-in voltage inside the device.41 As such, it is expected that ITIC can lower carrier recombination and increase the VOC of the device.

Fig. 4c shows the UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the bare TiO2 and TiO2/ITIC films prepared on quartz substrates. Even though the 20 nm ITIC shows recognizable optical absorption (Fig. 1c), the TiO2/ITIC film shows no observable absorption, indicating that the ultrathin ITIC layer in the latter sample causes no more than a negligible loss in parasitic absorption. Compared to the TiO2 film, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the TiO2/ITIC film (Fig. 4d) was significantly quenched, demonstrating that the TiO2/ITIC film is more effective in electron extraction due to fewer surface trap states. Further investigation (Fig. 4e) found no obvious difference between the absorption of the TiO2/ITIC/perovskite film and the TiO2/perovskite film, indicating that the ITIC film has negligible absorption in the sample. It thus suggests that the enhanced JSC in the ITIC-based devices is not caused by the absorption of the ITIC thin layer. Fig. 4f shows the PL spectra of the TiO2/perovskite film and TiO2/ITIC/perovksite film. The TiO2/perovskite film has the higher PL intensity, indicating that there is serious recombination in the sample. The PL intensity of the TiO2/ITIC/perovksite film is much suppressed, indicating that the charges transfer effectively before they are recombined at the interface. In other words, the ITIC-modified TiO2 improves electron extraction from the absorber layer,42 or the carrier recombination is effectively suppressed, hence yielding better device performance. We attribute it to the fact that the ITIC coating effectively passivates defects on the TiO2 surface, and therefore reduces carrier loss and improves the device performance.
Hysteresis is a notorious behavior of the planar PSCs. Fig. 5a shows typical J–V curves of the devices measured using both reverse and forward scan directions, with the key device parameters listed in Table 2. While the cell using the bare TiO2 displays clear hysteresis, it is surprising to see that the J–V hysteresis is eliminated when the TiO2 surface is modified using the ITIC. The device based on the bare TiO2 ETL gives a PCE of 17.12% under the reverse scan direction with a Jsc of 21.67 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.08 V and an FF of 73.2%. When tested using the forward scan direction, both FF and PCE are lowered to 62.7% and 14.19%, respectively. To our surprise, when the ITIC-modified TiO2 ETL is used, the J–V curves essentially overlap with each other for both reverse and forward scan directions, with the PCE measured using the reverse scan is as high as 20.08%, while the PCE remains to be 19.12% when measured using the forward scan. For the devices with the ITIC ETL (FTO/ITIC/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au), the J–V curves overlap with each other for both reversed and forward scan directions, with a PCE of 11.51% and 10.94%, respectively (Fig. S2c†). We believe that the significantly decreased hysteretic phenomenon is caused by a reduced trap-density in the ITIC-modified TiO2 surface. Fig. S6† shows dark J–V characteristics of the devices with and without the ITIC. It is found that the leakage current is considerably suppressed when incorporating the ITIC as the cathode interfacial layer in the perovskite solar cells. The smaller saturation current density (J0) leads to lower carrier recombination and superior diode performance.43,44 To further confirm the reproducibility of the devices, 25 individual devices were fabricated, and the PCE distribution histograms and the photovoltaic data (VOC, JSC, FF and PCE) of the corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. S7.† It appears that the PCE has fairly narrow distribution, meaning that the optimized devices present very good reproducibility.

To ensure that the J–V measurement is reliable, the photocurrent density and PCE of the champion devices were recorded as a function of time when the cells were biased at their respective VMP (voltage at the maximum power point, in this case 0.84 V for TiO2 and 0.94 V for ITIC-modified TiO2), as shown in Fig. S8.†45 All the devices show stable performance. The PCE of the champion device using TiO2 is 16.98%, while that of the ITIC-modified TiO2 is 19.86%, over a 100 s measurement window. These values are very close to the PCE obtained from the reverse scan for the J–V measurement. To study the thermal stability of the device with or without ITIC-modified TiO2, all the devices are placed on a hot plate in a glove box for annealing treatment. As shown in Fig. S9,† we found that the newly developed PSCs with an ITIC blocking layer cannot affect the thermal stability of the device.
The recombination resistance and transport resistance of devices with and without ITIC were analyzed using electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), as shown in Fig. 5b. In the impedance spectroscopy, the diameter of the semicircle represents the shunt resistance46 that is usually related to the carrier loss due to current leakage pathways and recombination of charges in the bulk or at the interfaces.47 The largest shunt resistance observed in the device using ITIC-modified TiO2 demonstrates the least carrier recombination and therefore the best photovoltaic performance. The top-right inset gives the equivalent circuit composed of the Rs, the recombination resistance (Rrec) and the transport resistance (Rtr). The Rrec and Rtr are assigned to the low-frequency and the high-frequency region in the EIS, respectively.48 The fitted parameters by the equivalent circuit are listed in Table S1.† The Rs of the pristine TiO2 ETL and TiO2/ITIC ETL-based PSCs are 30 and 25 Ω (2.7 and 2.25 Ω cm2), respectively, very close to what was measured from the J–V curves (Table 1). The smaller Rs facilitates carrier transport, leading to a larger Jsc.17 Interestingly, compared to the control device, the Rrec of the TiO2/ITIC ETL-based PSCs is significantly increased to 2800 Ω from 1350 Ω, effectively suppressing the charge recombination for improved device performance. From the complex plane curves, two characteristic time constants can be extracted from the peak of the large semicircle in the Cole–Cole plot corresponding to a frequency's reciprocal:49 the diffusion time τd and the effective lifetime τn. The diffusion time τd can be determined from the high-frequency side of the impedance curves, while the effective lifetime τn can be determined from the low-frequency side of the impedance curves. It can be seen that the τd and τn for the device with the ITIC-modified TiO2 (31.5 μs and 2.0 μs, respectively) are always longer than those based on the bare TiO2 one (25.0 μs and 1.6 μs, respectively), indicating less carrier recombination and more efficient carrier transport.
To gain more insight into charge carrier kinetics including photo-induced charge transfer and charge recombination,50 time-resolved PL (TRPL) has been carried out. TRPL characterization is recognized as an effective tool to monitor the trap-state density in the perovskite films and the details are shown in ESI.†Fig. 5c shows the PL decay time (τi) and amplitudes (Ai) of the samples fitted by a bi-exponential decay function, with the key parameters listed in Table S2.† It appears that the PL decay time of the pristine TiO2 ETL-based PSCs are τ1 = 67.45 ns and τ2 = 9.28 ns, with the corresponding amplitudes 21.28% and 78.72%, respectively. For the TiO2/ITIC ETL-based PSCs, both τ1 and τ2 are decreased to 34.93 and 7.07 ns, with the corresponding amplitudes 10.02% and 89.98%, respectively. The average recombination lifetime (τave) can be estimated using the following equation:51 (1)
Compared to the pristine TiO2 ETL-based PSCs, the PL decay time is significantly reduced for the perovskite film coated on TiO2/ITIC ETLs. The τave using the TiO2/ITIC ETL is decreased to 17.04 ns from 47.83 ns, demonstrating that the electrons transfer faster from the perovskite film to the TiO2/ITIC ETL, compared to the TiO2 ETL, as witnessed by stronger steady-state PL quenching. It is apparent that the electron transfer from the perovskite absorber layer into the TiO2/ITIC can be carried out effectively as the lower WF of the ITIC-coated TiO2 is expected to decrease the interface barrier, facilitating more efficient electron transport and collection.
Conclusion
In conclusion, the perovskite solar cell performance has been improved dramatically by inserting a thin layer of ITIC on the TiO2 ETL. The ITIC modification creates a much smoothed TiO2 surface for better conformal deposition of the high-quality perovskite absorber. It is found that the layer also passivates the defects that commonly exist on the bare TiO2 surface, and thus avoids unnecessary carrier recombination. In addition, the band alignment is optimized, leading to enhanced VOC through quasi-Fermi level shifting. As a result, the solar cell efficiency is improved to as high as 20.08%, among the highest for the planar-type PSCs.
Experimental section
Material preparation
All of the materials used in this study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as received without further purification. Corning Eagle XG glasses with FTO electrodes were used as the substrates.
CH3NH3PbI3 solution preparation:52 A mixture solution of 1 M PbI2/1 M methylammonium iodide (MAI) was dissolved in a DMSO and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) mixed solvent (3:7 v/v). This solution was filtered through a 0.4 μm-pore PTFE filter after stirring at 60 °C for 24 h and stored under a dry nitrogen atmosphere.
HTL solution preparation: The solution was prepared by dissolving Spiro-OMeTAD (90 mg), sulfonyl imide (Li-TFSI, 22 μL) solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 ml acetonitrile) and tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 36 μL) in 1 ml of chlorobenzene.
Perovskite solar cell fabrication
Planar PSC solar cells were fabricated by using a simple one-step spin-coating method: FTO-coated glass was employed as the substrate, which was first washed with a mild detergent, ultrasonically cleaned, and dried under a nitrogen stream. After a TiO2 ETL was deposited onto the FTO-glass by the solution method as reported,53 a different concentration of ITIC in chlorobenzene solution was spin-cast at a speed of 2000 rpm for 30 s to modify the TiO2 layer. A prepared mixture solution of CH3NH3PbI3 was then spin-cast onto the ITIC film at a speed of 4000 rpm for 40 s. Then, the films were heated at 100 °C for 15 min. HTL solution was spin-cast onto the perovskite film at a speed of 5000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, an Au electrode (99.99%, 100 nm) was evaporated as the back contact. The finished devices were not sealed but stored under dry conditions and characterized in a normal ambient atmosphere.
Material characterization
The surface morphology was characterized by using a scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Jeol SU-8020) and an atomic force microscope (AFM, Dimension ICON). The samples were excited by using a pulsed laser, with a wavelength of 365 nm or 532 nm. The contact angles were measured on an OCA20 machine (Data-physics, Germany). The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured at 25 °C under the AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination (scan rate: 30 mV s−1 and scan direction: open-circuit bias to short-circuit bias). A black-cardboard mask with a window of 0.09 cm2 was clipped onto the glass side to define the active area of the cell. The spectral response was obtained by using an EQE measurement system (QEX10, PV Measurement), which is equipped with a monochromator, a lock-in amplifier, a Xe lamp, and a current–voltage amplifier. Prior to the use of the light, the spectral response and the light intensity were calibrated using a mono-silicon detector. The frequency-dependent capacitance (C-f) of the device was obtained with the semiconductor device analyzer (Agilent Technologies, B1500A). The AC voltage perturbation was of 20 mV and a constant zero bias was maintained. Each spectrum was measured ranging from 1 KHz to 1 MHz. XPS measurements were performed in a VG ESCALAB MK2 system with monochromatized Al Kα under a pressure of 5.0 × 10−7 Pa. The UPS measurements were analysed in a Thermo Scientific ESCA Lab 250Xi system with helium gas admitted and the HeI (21.22 eV) emission line employed.
