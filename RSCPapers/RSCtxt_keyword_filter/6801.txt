    , Accepted 22nd September 2019First published on 27th September 2019AbstractForming a 2D capping layer has been recognized as an effective strategy to improve both efficiency and stability of organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells. However, constructing a 2D/3D heterostructure is difficult for inorganic perovskites due to their resistance to cation exchange reaction. Here, we report an effective in situ growth method to form a 2D/3D heterostructure for inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite. The 2D capping layer was found to form a type-II heterojunction with 3D perovskites, facilitating hole extraction at the perovskite/hole transport layer interface. When exposed to a humid environment, the 2D/3D perovskite films showed greatly enhanced phase stability as compared to the pristine 3D perovskite films. As a result, the optimized 2D/3D CsPbI2Br device reached a power conversion efficiency of 14.5% with improved short-circuit current and significantly enhanced device moisture stability.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites with the three-dimensional (3D) structure of ABX3 (typically the A site is methylammonium (MA) or formamidinium (FA), the B site is Pb and the X site is I or Br) have emerged as promising semiconductors for light harvesting. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite-based solar cells has reached a certified value of 24.2% which is higher than the record efficiency of mainstream multi-crystalline silicon solar cells.1–3 However, poor thermal stability, induced by labile organic components (e.g. MA), is one of the intrinsic drawbacks of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, which impedes their commercial applications.4,5 In contrast, all-inorganic lead halide perovskites of CsPbX3 (X = I, Br or mixed halides) possess excellent thermal stability and have shown great possibilities in achieving efficient and stable solar cells.6–8 These cesium lead halides were also found to be tolerant to a wide range of environmental factors such as oxygen and ultraviolet irradiation.9 In contrast to other Cs-based perovskites, such as CsPbBr3 (with a large band gap of 2.3 eV) and phase instable CsPbI3, the mixed halide CsPbI2Br has gained much attention due to its relatively improved phase stability and reasonable bandgap (1.92 eV) potentially for tandem applications10,11. However, under a humid environment, CsPbI2Br still shows a fast phase transition from the optoelectronically favorable cubic to the undesirable orthorhombic phase.12 Development of effective methods to improve the moisture stability of CsPbI2Br is highly required.
Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden–Popper perovskites have shown great moisture stability owing to the presence of hydrophobic long-chain alkyl-ammonium cations.13 Beyond 2D perovskites, mixed dimensional perovskites based on FA1−xMAxPbI3−yBry hybrid perovskites and different 2D components like butylamine (BA), phenylethylamine (PEA) and ethanolamine (EA) were developed to balance efficiency and stability.14–17 Zhang et al. reported that a small amount of ethylenediamine (EDA) cations can stabilize inorganic CsPbI3 by adding 2D EDAPbI4 into perovskite precursors.18 Jiang et al. introduced PEAI into the CsPbI3 system to construct a quasi-2D perovskite layer (PEA2Csn−1PbnI3n+1), achieving a PCE of 12.4% and improved performance longevity when n was 60.19 Another approach to form the 2D/3D configuration is to apply a secondary growth process to convert the top region of a 3D perovskite layer to a thin 2D perovskite layer, forming a 2D/3D heterojunction structure. When exposed to a humid environment, the 2D capping layer would effectively retard the invasion of water molecules and therefore improve moisture stability. In addition to stability enhancement, the thickness of the 2D perovskite layer and band alignment between the 2D and 3D perovskites require careful optimization for different device architectures to enable efficient charge carrier transport and high device efficiencies.20
To date, most of the 2D/3D heterostructures have been formed based on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites by spin coating solutions containing long-chain alkyl-ammonium halides on fully-crystallized 3D perovskites (also known as cation exchange reaction), as organic–inorganic perovskites can easily react with long-chain alkyl-ammonium halides to form 2D perovskites.14,21 In contrast, such a cation exchange reaction seems to be difficult to realize for all-inorganic Cs perovskites. Wang et al. reported that the CsPbI3 thin film cannot be converted to 2D perovskites even after soaking in a PEAI solution for 1 hour.22 Therefore, developing strategies to achieve a stable 2D capping layer for inorganic Cs perovskites becomes imperative.
In this work, we demonstrate an in situ growth method to form a 2D/3D heterostructure based on inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite. We discover that adding a small amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) into the alkyl-ammonium halide solutions is crucial to realize the cation conversion process. By carefully tuning the conversion process, we are able to form a type-II heterojunction between the 2D and 3D perovskites, which promotes hole extraction and suppresses charge carrier recombination. The 2D/3D heterostructure also enhances light absorption and brings about a higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) and PCE in complete solar cell devices. Importantly, the device moisture stability was greatly improved with the 2D/3D heterostructure.
Results and discussion
Since inorganic perovskites cannot go through cation exchange spontaneously, we consider adding solvents to help the reaction. As we schematically present the experimental procedure in Fig. 1a, the in situ formation of a quasi-2D perovskite is achieved by spin-coating a BAI solution in chlorobenzene (CB) with 1 vol% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on the top of the annealed CsPbI2Br film. We note that without the addition of DMSO, BAI cannot be dissolved and dispersed in CB. In addition, DMSO would dissolve a thin layer of the 3D CsPbI2Br film which enables the cation exchange process with BAI to form 2D perovskites. It is worth mentioning that the BAI solution was dynamically dropped onto the 3D CsPbI2Br film during spinning so that DMSO can uniformly diffuse into the 3D CsPbI2Br film and only convert the top surface region rather than converting the whole 3D perovskite layer to a 2D structure when applying steady-state spin coating (Fig. S1†).

The XRD patterns of the pristine and treated CsPbI2Br films are presented in Fig. 1b, noted as w/o (pristine CsPbI2Br) or x mg (treated with x mg mL−1 BAI solution). All films showed XRD peaks at around 14.7°, 21.0° and 29.5°, which can be assigned to the (100), (110) and (200) diffractions of the cubic CsPbI2Br perovskite phase.23 For the treated films, these peaks kept shifting toward lower 2θ positions with increasing BAI concentration (Fig. 1c), suggesting lattice expansion. This may be due to the change in halide composition induced by the diffusion of iodide ions from BAI to CsPbI2Br films.24 At high BAI concentrations (5 mg and 7 mg), new diffraction peaks at 8.9°, 13.3°, 17.8°, 26.7° and 31.1° emerged, which cannot be assigned to the diffractions from BAI (Fig. S2a†). We assume that these peaks correspond to the (004), (006), (008), (0012) and (0014) planes of a quasi-2D perovskite with the structure of BA2Csn−1PbnX3n+1. According to Bragg's law 2dsinθ = nλ, where d is the interplanar spacing, θ is the scattering angle and λ is the X-ray wavelength, the interplanar spacing of (002) can be calculated to be 19.84 Å, which is similar to the diffraction of BA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1 when n = 2 as reported previously.13 To identify the new phase, we fabricated a series of BA2Csn−1PbnX3n+1 films with n from 1 to 4, and surprisingly found that the XRD pattern of BA2CsPb2I6Br (n = 2) is well matched with the observed peaks (Fig. S2b†). Therefore, we speculate that a 2D BA2CsPb2I6Br capping layer is formed on the top of the CsPbI2Br film after BAI treatment. In addition, a small peak at 6.4° appears in the film treated with 7 mg BAI, which can be ascribed to the formation of 2D BA2PbI4 due to the high concentration of BAI.14
The pristine CsPbI2Br film exhibits a compact, pinhole-free surface morphology with a grain size of about 200 nm (Fig. 2a). With BAI treatment, some granular and lamellar crystals appear on the surface, validating the formation of 2D perovskites (Fig. 2b–e). We speculate that the BA2CsPb2I6Br 2D perovskite has already formed when treated with 1 mg or 3 mg BAI, although its XRD patterns showed no apparent (00l) peaks due to the relatively low amount. The thickness of the CsPbI2Br film is around 280 nm (Fig. S3a†), and a thin 2D layer can be observed at the perovskite/HTM interface after BAI treatment (Fig. S3b–d†). Fig. 2f shows the cross-section image of the film treated with 7 mg BAI, in which the 2D layer can grow to tens of nanometers and be clearly distinguished, at the cost of reduced CsPbI2Br thickness due to the in situ reaction.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to further estimate the effects of BAI treatment. Since the inorganic CsPbI2Br possesses no N element, the N 1s spectrum (Fig. 3a) indicates increasing BA+ content in treated films. More importantly, the Pb 4f peaks shifted toward higher binding energy with increasing BAI content (Fig. 3b), as well as the Cs 3d, I 3d and Br 3d core levels (Fig. S4†), suggesting that the BA+ gets into the lattice and changes the crystal structure. It also indicates a stronger chemical bonding among Pb, Cs and halide atoms, which provides a foundation to stability improvement at the atomic level.25 In the 7 mg BAI treated film, two small peaks located at 136.3 and 141.2 eV related to metallic Pb appeared,26 indicating that high concentration BAI treatment may introduce more defects into perovskite films.

(f) Photoelectron emission spectra of 3D CsPbI2Br and 2D BA2CsPb2I6Br films, the inset shows the illustration of band alignment of the 2D/3D bilayer perovskite-HTM. 

Fig. 3c shows the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the various films. The pristine film exhibits a typical spectrum of CsPbI2Br with the absorption edge at around 647 nm.6 With BAI treatment, we observe a slight red-shift of the absorption edge due to the diffusion-induced I-doping being consistent with what has been observed in the XRD measurement. In addition, we observe a stronger absorption below 550 nm at low BA concentrations (1 and 3 mg mL−1), which is likely to be associated with the formed 2D perovskites.25 In films treated with 5 mg or 7 mg BAI, the absorption edge at around 540 nm, corresponding to the 2D BA2CsPb2I6Br (Fig. S5a†), becomes clear enough to be identified, while their long wavelength absorption gradually decreased because of the reduced thickness of the CsPbI2Br film, as illustrated in cross-sectional SEM images. As a result, the 2D/3D heterostructure is beneficial to light absorption when the 2D layer is relatively thin. The steady-state photoluminescence spectra (PL) of different films show red-shifted CsPbI2Br luminescence peaks from 647 nm to 654 nm as well as increased luminescence intensity at 540 nm with increased BAI concentration (Fig. 3d). The PL data are in good agreement with the UV-vis results. The small PL peak at around 510 nm in the film treated with 7 mg BAI was supposed to originate from the BA2PbI4, which is consistent with our XRD results.27
The time-resolved PL (TRPL) was measured to investigate the charge transfer and recombination in the 2D/3D heterostructure films. Fig. 3e shows the TRPL decays of the pristine and treated films deposited on glass substrates. The lifetime was fitted with a bi-exponential decay function I(t) = A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2), in which the fast decay component τ1 is associated with trap-assisted recombination and the slow decay component τ2 reflects the radiative carrier lifetime.28 The fitting results and calculated average lifetime are listed in Table 1. After treatment with 1 mg BAI, the average lifetime prolonged from 7.04 to 9.24 ns, indicating the potential defect passivation by the 2D capping layer,14 while the films displayed a shortened lifetime with further increased BAI concentration, which may be attributed to the carrier transfer between the 3D and 2D perovskites. As presented in Fig. 3f, the valence band positions of 3D CsPbI2Br and 2D BA2CsPb2I6Br were ascertained to be 5.48 and 5.27 eV respectively. Their bandgaps can be calculated from the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra to be 1.92 and 2.29 eV (Fig. S5b and c†). Therefore, the top 2D perovskite forms a type-II heterojunction with the bottom 3D perovskite, thus facilitating the charge separation and quenching the PL emission (inset of Fig. 3f). TRPL decays based on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/perovskite/HTL devices were further collected and fitted as shown in Fig. S6 and Table S1†. Considering that the BAI treatment was applied to the well-crystallized perovskite films, the post-treatment would have less effect on changing the FTO/perovskite interface.14 The films treated with 3 mg BAI displayed the shortest lifetime, suggesting its promoted hole extraction effects. In contrast, much slower decays were monitored in 5 mg or 7 mg BAI treated films, which may be assigned to the mismatching band alignment between the 3D perovskite and partly formed wide-bandgap BA2PbI4 after high concentration BAI treatment.

Planar solar cells were fabricated with the structure of FTO/TiO2-[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM)/perovskite/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)/Au, and Fig. 4a compares the characteristic current density–voltage (J–V) curves of various devices. Solar cells based on pristine CsPbI2Br generated a PCE of 13.7%, and devices treated with 3 mg BAI showed a substantially improved PCE of 14.5% (Table 2), which is among the highest efficiencies of CsPbI2Br based devices.29–32 The enhanced PCE is mainly ascribed to the improved Jsc (Fig. 4b), which can originate from the improved light absorption and charge carrier extraction with the 2D/3D structure, while further increasing the BAI concentration led to a poor PCE with drastically decreased Jsc and fill factor (FF), which may be due to the band misalignment induced by 2D perovskites with different n values. The thick 2D layer in high concentration BAI treated devices may also be less conductive and induce more defects detrimental to device performance. Besides the improvement in Jsc, the Voc of 3 mg BAI treated devices also slightly increased by 0.02 V compared to the pristine device. We speculate that the increase of Voc is related to passivation effects of 2D components BA+ and I− as previously reported.14,22Fig. 4c presents the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra recorded from 300 to 700 nm. Compared with that of devices based on pristine perovskites, the IPCE value of devices based on treated films first rises and then declines, which is in accordance with measured Jsc. The increase in the nearly full wavelength range can be mainly attributed to more efficient charge extraction of the 2D/3D heterostructure in 3 mg BAI treated films. In contrast, despite high absorption, the IPCE of devices with 5 mg BAI decreased due to the poor charge extraction induced by band misalignment as revealed by the PL measurements.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted to study the charge dynamics in the devices.33Fig. 4d illustrates the Nyquist plots obtained in the dark at −0.9 V bias voltage, from which only one semicircle at high frequency can be observed, corresponding to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) in devices.34 Since all devices contain a similar TiO2–PCBM/perovskite interface, the difference at the perovskite/HTL interface becomes the predominant reason for the Rct variation.35 By applying an equivalent circuit model (inset of Fig. 4d), the Rct values of pristine devices and those with BAI concentrations from 1 mg to 7 mg were fitted as 1804, 1693, 701, 1488 and 4074 Ω, respectively. The lowest Rct implies the fastest carrier transfer in the 3 mg BAI treated device, which is consistent with PL results and can account for its high device performance.
Fig. S7a and b† show XRD patterns of the 3 mg BAI treated CsPbI2Br film and BA2CsPb2I6Br film heated at 85 °C for 10 hours in a N2-filled glovebox. The XRD patterns remained unchanged compared with that of as-prepared films, which is consistent with the good thermal stability of BA/Cs quasi-2D perovskites previously reported.36 This suggests that the advantage of the high thermal stability of inorganic perovskites would not be significantly sacrificed with the 2D/3D heterostructure.
To examine whether the 2D/3D perovskite films exhibit better moisture stability, we conducted XRD measurements of pristine and treated perovskite films exposed to an ambient environment with 40% relative humidity (RH) for 10 min, as shown in Fig. 5a. The inset presents the corresponding optical photographs. The pristine CsPbI2Br film has already become nearly transparent after exposure, and the intensity of the (100) main peak substantially decreased with diffraction peaks of the non-perovskite phase appearing evidently at 9.9°.37 With increasing BAI concentration, we expect a better coverage and a higher thickness of the 2D layer on top of the 3D bulk film, thus enhancing the moisture resistance. The non-perovskite peak intensity declined to negligible levels in 3 mg BAI treated films, and the XRD pattern of 7 mg BAI treated films remained identical to the initial one. To see whether the 2D/3D structure has an impact on the stability of complete devices, we stored unencapsulated devices in a dry box of ambient air with ∼10% RH for 25 days, and then ∼25% RH for another 25 days (Fig. 5b). Under 10% RH exposure, all the devices maintained over 95% of their initial PCE, indicating that CsPbI2Br perovskites can retain high performance in a dry atmosphere. However, when exposed to 25% RH for another 25 days, the PCE of pristine devices dropped drastically to only 2%. In contrast, 3 mg and 5 mg BAI treated devices still exhibited over 10% PCE, retaining 80% and 91% of their initial performance, which verified the efficient protection against water penetration of 2D layers. Our results clearly indicate that a high humidity environment would induce a phase transition of inorganic Cs perovskites and deteriorate device stability, which can be effectively suppressed by the developed 2D/3D heterostructure.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrate an effective method to form a 2D/3D heterostructure based on inorganic CsPbI2Br perovskite. Via introducing a small amount of DMSO into the BAI solution, CsPbI2Br perovskite can be partly dissolved and react with BAI to form a 2D perovskite capping layer. The 2D/3D heterostructure modulates the band alignment to facilitate hole extraction at the perovskite/HTL interface, leading to a high Jsc in the final device. The optimized 2D/3D device showed a PCE of 14.5% with significantly enhanced stability, maintaining over 80% PCE after storage for 50 days in ambient air (10% RH for 25 days and 25% RH for 25 days) under dark conditions. This work developed a novel and effective strategy to create a 2D/3D cesium lead halide inorganic perovskite photo-absorber which can improve moisture stability without sacrificing device performance.
Experimental section
Materials
Unless specified, all the materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Alfa Aesar and used without further purification. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glasses (sheet resistance ∼7 Ω sq−1) were purchased from Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). PCBM was purchased from Luminescence Technology Corp. Spiro-OMeTAD was purchased from Borun Chemical Co., Ltd. (Zhejiang, China). BAI was purchased from Polymer Light Co. Ltd (Xi'an China).
Device fabrication
FTO coated glasses were partially etched with Zn powder and 2 M HCl. Then the etched substrates were cleaned with deionized water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol sequentially. Before use, the substrates were treated with O2-plasma for 3 min to make them well hydrophilic. The TiO2 compact layers were deposited by spin-coating a solution of titanium isopropoxide in ethanol at 2000 rpm for 60 s, and annealed at 500 °C for 30 min.38 Then an 8 mg mL−1 PCBM solution in CB was spin-coated on the top of the TiO2 compact layer at 4000 rpm for 40 s in a N2-filled glove box. The 0.9 M CsPbI2Br precursor solution was prepared by dissolving CsI, PbI2 and PbBr2 in a 1 mL DMF/DMSO (volume ratio 4:1) mixture with a 1:0.5:0.5 ratio. Perovskite films were deposited on FTO/TiO2/PCBM substrates by spin-coating the precursor solution at 1000 r for 10 s and 4000 r for 45 s. During the second step, chlorobenzene was quickly dropped onto the film at the last 15 s. The samples were placed at room temperature for 15 min and then annealed at 150 °C for 1 min. For BAI treatment, 1, 3, 5 or 7 mg BAI and 10 mL DMSO were added to 990 mL CB. Then 100 μL of the solution was dropped within 2–3 seconds on the perovskite film spinning at 4000 r, and the samples were annealed at 150 °C for 1 min. Subsequently, the spiro-OMeTAD precursor solution, prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD (2,2,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene), 28.8 μL TBP (4-tert-butylpyridine) and 17.5 μL LiTFSI solution (520 mg mL−1 bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonamide lithium salt in acetonitrile) in 1 mL CB, was spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 40 s to form the hole transport layer. Finally, 80 nm Au was thermally evaporated on the top of the device as the electrode.
Characterization
The crystalline structures of the perovskite films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D8 Advance diffractometer, Bruker, Germany, Cu-Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å). The morphology of the films was observed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Merlin, Zeiss, Germany). The XPS spectra were recorded on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250Xi) with Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV) as the illumination source. Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra were recorded using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda 950, PerkinElmer, USA) in the 300–800 nm wavelength range at room temperature. Steady-state and time-resolved PL spectra were detected using a fluorescence spectrometer (FLS920, Edinburgh Instruments, U.K.). The steady-state PL spectra were collected by illuminating the sample with a monochromatic xenon lamp source (λexc = 460 nm). The TRPL spectra were acquired with samples photoexcited by a pulsed laser beam (405 nm, 10 MHz, pulse duration of <100 ps) in a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) mode. The photoelectron emission spectra were recorded with an AC-2 instrument (AC-2, RIKEN Instruments, Japan) with a reference sample of Au. The photocurrent–voltage characteristics of perovskite solar cells were measured using a calibrated (with a standard silicon solar cell) solar simulator (91192, Oriel, USA) with a digital source meter (2400, Keithley Instruments, USA) under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm2), and the active area of the tested solar cells was defined as 0.06 cm2 and 1 cm2 using metal masks. A 450 W xenon lamp (69920, Newport, USA) was used for steady-state power measurements. The IPCE spectra were obtained using a QEX10 solar cell quantum efficiency measurement system (QEX10, PV measurements). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded using a Zahner system under dark conditions with a bias of −0.9 V, with frequencies ranging from 1 Hz to 1 M Hz and a modulation amplitude of 10 mV.
