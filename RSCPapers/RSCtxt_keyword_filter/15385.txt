    , Accepted 30th June 2020First published on 1st July 2020AbstractDue to their unique merits, asymmetrical fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) have received increasing attention in the field of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Herein, we designed and synthesized an asymmetrical FREA, namely AY6, by employing a cross-conceptual strategy which combines the structural features of asymmetrical IT6-4F with high-performance Y6. Compared to Y-shape Y6, X-shape AY6 shows poor crystallization properties and thus a significantly blue-shifted absorption. However, it is precisely because of this unfavorable self-stacking effect that AY6 has an opportunity to pack with PM6 and form a new intermixed phase. As a result, the PM6:AY6 blend film exhibits a perfect face-on orientation with stronger π–π stacking than the PM6:Y6 blend film, which facilitates efficient exciton dissociation and balanced carrier transport, and therefore higher FF. In general, such a cross-conceptual design strategy is an effective method which not only boosts the efficiency of asymmetrical FREA-based OSCs but also increases the fill factors of OSCs based on Y6-like FREAs.
1. Introduction
Fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) composed of a rigid ladder-type core and strong electron-withdrawing end groups have been proven to be very promising small molecule acceptors (SMAs).1–11 The merits of such FREAs lie in their easily tailored chemical structures enabling judicious optimization of optical properties,12–16 the frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels17–20 and the crystallization properties.21–27 FREAs significantly reduce the energy loss (Eloss) of organic solar cells (OSCs) compared to fullerene-based systems28–33 since FREAs can not only show absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region, but also possess suitable energy levels to match well with polymer donors which possess deep-lying HOMO energy levels. Recently, Zou et al. designed and synthesized Y6, a new SMA based on benzothiadiazole (BT) fused with pyrroles.3 As the state-of-the-art electron acceptor, the combination of Y6 and PM6 delivered a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 15.7% with an exceptionally high Jsc of over 25 mA cm−2 in single-junction devices. The significant PCE enhancement of OSCs is closely correlated with the structural engineering and in-depth understanding of the structure–property relationship of SMAs.1,3,6–9,12–19,21–60
Over the past two years, the studies on asymmetrical SMAs have received increasing attention because such a strategy allows different functional groups to be selectively and asymmetrically attached on different sides of FREAs, which enables exquisite adjustments on molecular properties.38 Asymmetrical FREAs have been found to have two advantages over symmetrical analogues: (i) the non-centrosymmetric molecular configuration endows asymmetrical SMAs with a large intrinsic dipole moment, which not only enhances the intermolecular π–π stacking but also optimizes the micromorphology of the active layer, significantly promoting the fill factor (FF) of OSCs,39,40 and (ii) asymmetrical SMAs are able to exhibit more complicated molecular conformations compared to symmetrical analogues, which is beneficial in terms of lifting the LUMO energy level without sacrificing or even broadening the absorption range of SMAs, thus obviously reducing the Eloss of OSCs.29,41,42,60
Inspired by the high photovoltaic performance of Y6 and the unique merits of asymmetrical SMAs, we rationally brought together essential moieties from both Y6 and IT6-4F (possessing an asymmetrical core with a six fused rings) to design a new type of asymmetrical SMA (Fig. 1a) with an aim to create better asymmetrical acceptors and further explore their effects on photovoltaic performance. By replacing the benzodicyclopentadiene (BDC) building block in IT6-4F with a pivotal unit of benzothiadiazolepyrrole (BTP) in Y6, we synthesized a novel asymmetrical SMA, namely AY6. Two strong electron-donating pyrrole units combined with electron-withdrawing BT not only largely redshift the absorption range but also maintain the HOMO energy level (to match with that of PM6) of AY6 compared to IT6-4F. As a result, a high PCE of 15.6% was achieved in PM6:AY6-based OSCs, which is significantly higher than that of PM6:IT6-4F-based OSCs (with a PCE of 10.8%) due to the greatly increased Jsc. Compared to the control device based on PM6:Y6, asymmetrical AY6-based OSCs demonstrated a comparable PCE with an enhanced Voc and FF, but a reduced Jsc. Compared to Y-shape Y6, X-shape AY6 shows poor crystallization properties. However, it is because of this unfavorable self-stacking effect that AY6 has an opportunity to pack with PM6 and form a new intermixed phase. As a result, the PM6:AY6 blend film exhibits a perfect face-on orientation with stronger π–π stacking than the PM6:Y6 blend film, which leads to more balanced charge carrier transport and more efficient exciton dissociation than those of its parental systems. These results revealed that the cross-conceptual design method by combining the asymmetrical strategy and Y6 not only boosts the PCE of asymmetrical SMA-based OSCs but also enhances the FF of OSCs based on Y6-like SMAs.

2. Results and discussion
2.1 Materials synthesis and characterization

Scheme 1 outlines the synthetic route of asymmetrical SMA AY6. As depicted, compound 2 was synthesized via a Stille coupling reaction between 4,7-dibromo-5,6-dinitrobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (compound 1) and tributyl(6-undecylthieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)stannane where the reactant stoichiometry, reaction temperature and time need to be controlled precisely in order to obtain a high yield. A successive Stille coupling reaction was conducted and a 3-hexylthiophene unit was connected onto compound 2 to obtain the key asymmetrical intermediate compound 3. Then, compound 3 was intramolecularly cyclized through a triethyl phosphite-induced Cadogan reaction to form two fused pyrrole rings, followed by N-alkylation with two 2-ethylhexyl as sidechains (compound 4). Subsequently, two formyl groups were successfully introduced into compound 4 by a Vilsmeier reaction and condensed with 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile to give the target SMA AY6. Meanwhile, to make a comprehensive comparison, two control molecules of IT6-4F and Y6 (whose structures are shown in Fig. 1a) were also synthesized according to reported methods.3,40 The synthetic details and characterization data including 1H/13C NMR and MS are presented in the ESI.† Three SMAs all exhibit good solubility in commonly used solvents, which meets the essential requirements for the spin-coating process.

2.2 Absorption and electrochemical properties
UV-vis absorption spectra of the three SMAs in solution and pure films were recorded, and are shown in Fig. 1b and c, respectively, with the characteristic data listed in Table 1. In solution, the maximum absorption peaks of IT6-4F, AY6 and Y6 are located at 679, 717 and 732 nm with the molar extinction coefficient being 1.27 × 105, 1.58 × 105 and 1.65 × 105 M−1 cm−1, respectively. The strong intermolecular aggregation from solution to the solid state induces a significant redshift of the absorption range, and the absorption peaks/edges in pure films are at 709/808 nm for IT6-4F, 789/892 nm for AY6 and 831/935 nm for Y6 with the optical bandgaps calculated to be 1.53, 1.39 and 1.33 eV, respectively. In fact, a near-infrared absorption of the Y6 film mainly results from strong stacking between Y6 molecules.45,57 Removing a thiophene unit from the Y6 central core weakens its electron-donating ability and causes a 15 nm spectral loss in solution. However, the major spectral sacrifice (42 nm) of AY6 in the film comes from intermolecular packing where AY6 is not as strong and ordered as Y6 (which will be discussed below). The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements of PM6, IT6-4F, AY6 and Y6 pure films were performed and their CV curves are plotted in Fig. S1.† According to the oxidation/reduction potentials, the corresponding HOMO/LUMO energy levels are estimated to be −5.45/−3.64, −5.69/−3.99, −5.69/−4.06 and −5.65/−4.09 eV (Fig. 1d), respectively. These measured results indicated that such a design strategy endows AY6 with a wide absorption range as well as suitable energy levels (between IT6-4F and Y6), which are anticipated to simultaneously obtain high Voc and large Jsc.

2.3 Charge transfer properties
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) experiments were carried out to investigate the charge transfer in PM6:IT6-4F, PM6:AY6 and PM6:Y6 blend films. As shown, the PM6 polymer exhibits a strong emission when excited at 550 nm. After blending with SMAs, a remarkable PL quenching (98.1% for PM6:IT6-4F, 98.9% for PM6:AY6 and 99.1% for PM6:Y6) can be observed within the range from 600 nm to 720 nm (behind is the emission of the three SMAs at 550 nm), indicating an effective electron transfer from PM6 to the three SMAs (Fig. 2a). SMA neat films show strong emission peaks in the range of 720–1050 nm when excited at different wavelengths (630 nm for IT6-4F, 710 nm for AY6 and 770 nm for Y6). Obviously, these emissions can be effectively quenching (98.3% for PM6:IT6-4F, 98.8% for PM6:AY6 and 98.5% for PM6:Y6) by incorporating the PM6 donor, indicating an effective hole transfer from SMAs to PM6 (Fig. 2b).

2.4 Theoretical calculations
To gain more insights into the difference among AY6, IT6-4F and Y6 at the molecular level, density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed using the B3LYP/6-31G* basis set, where the long alkyl side chains are replaced by methyl groups. As shown, the optimal configuration of the AY6 molecule is that two end groups are distributed in nearly an anti-conformation along the long axis of the molecule, which is obviously different from that of IT6-4F and Y6, whose end groups are aligned in the same direction (Fig. S2†). IT6-4F possesses a preferably planar structure; however, both AY6 and Y6 show a twisted structure with a non-planar central core due to the steric effect caused by the N-alkyl chains. The 3D structures of AY6 and Y6 are shown in Fig. 3 to clearly illustrate the different molecular configurations. Owing to the nearly anti-conformation of the end groups, AY6 forms an X shape from the BT unit with a dihedral angle of 15.8°, while Y6 is in a Y shape with a slightly larger dihedral angle (16.4°). It is generally acknowledged that differences in molecular configurations may have different effects on intermolecular interaction. It should be noted that though the molecular configuration between Y6 and AY6 differs greatly, they exhibit small and close dipole moments (within 1 debye) which are significantly smaller than that of IT6-4F. We suspected that this phenomenon is caused by the nonplanarity of AY6 and Y6. The LUMO and HOMO of AY6 and Y6 are evenly distributed throughout the molecular framework, which are beneficial to the electron and hole transport within the molecule. It can be clearly observed that the LUMOs of AY6 and Y6 are not distributed in the electron-withdrawing thiadiazole unit, indicating that the thiadiazole unit will not have influences on the LUMO energy level of such molecules and the down-shift in the LUMO energy level is mainly due to the electron-donating pyrrole moieties. Instead, the HOMOs are distributed on the thiadiazole unit, which reveals the reason why Y6-like SMAs have ultra-narrow bandgaps while maintaining low-lying HOMO energy levels. The calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels for IT6-4F, AY6 and Y6 are −6.09/−3.68, −6.11/−3.70 and −6.00/−3.76 eV, which are well consistent with the trend of measured values.

2.5 Photovoltaic performance
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of AY6, conventional devices with a structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PM6:acceptor (IT6-4F, AY6 or Y6)/PDIN (a perylene diimide with two aminated alkyl chains)/Al were fabricated (Fig. 4a). As reported, PM6 was selected as an optimal polymer donor for Y-series due to its suitable bandgap (Fig. 1c) and deep-lying HOMO energy level (Fig. 1d) which can match well with those SMAs to simultaneously acquire good exciton dissociation and an excellent morphology.3 Based on previous device fabrication methods in the literature,61–64 the total concentration of the donor and acceptor in chloroform (CF) solution was set as 16 mg mL−1 with a weight ratio of 1:1.2. We optimized the devices by successively employing additive (0.5% 1-chloronaphthalene, v/v), solvent annealing (CS2, 30 s) and thermal annealing (100 °C, 3 min) treatments (Fig. S3 and Table S1†), and the best-performing current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the three OSCs are displayed in Fig. 4b with the corresponding photovoltaic parameters summarized in Table 2. As shown, PM6:AY6-based OSCs achieved a 15.6% PCE (a Voc of 0.87 V, a Jsc of 23.54 mA cm−2 and a FF of 76.3%), which is equal to that of PM6:Y6-based OSCs (a PCE of 15.6% with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 24.66 mA cm−2 and a FF of 74.5%) and significantly higher than that of PM6:IT6-4F-based OSCs (a PCE of 10.8% with a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 16.69 mA cm−2 and a FF of 72.1%). The series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH) of the three OSCs were calculated according to their optimal J–V curves and are presented in Table 2, which are 6.25/1136 Ω cm2 for PM6:IT6-4F-based OSCs, 2.55/1428 Ω cm2 for PM6:AY6-based OSCs and 2.89/1236 Ω cm2 for PM6:Y6-based OSCs. It is apparent that the RS value is reduced and the RSH value is increased in PM6:AY6-based OSCs compared to those of PM6:IT6-4F- and PM6:Y6-based OSCs, which is beneficial to the enhancement of FF. From the structural perspective, it is obvious that replacing the BDC building block in IT6-4F with the BTP unit significantly increases the Jsc while maintaining a small Voc loss, which not only reduces the energy loss (Eloss) but also boosts the PCE of asymmetrical SMA-based OSCs. Moreover, applying the asymmetrical design strategy on Y6 by removing a fused thiophene unit from the Y6 skeleton improves the FF, which also lays a good foundation for us to further enhance the PCE of OSCs based on Y6-like SMAs. In addition, another polymer PM7 was selected to blend with AY6 and Y6 to confirm the improved FF. OSCs based on PM7:AY6 and PM7:Y6 fabricated under the same conditions achieved a 76.5% and 71.4% FF, respectively (corresponding J–V curves and EQE spectrum are shown in Fig. S4 with photovoltaic parameters summarized in Table S2†). These results implied that this cross-conceptual design strategy through combining the advantages of different kinds of SMAs can effectively improve the photovoltaic performance. It is worth mentioning that 15.6% PCE represents one of the highest values in asymmetrical SMA-based OSCs currently (Table S3†). In addition, the repeatability of devices was confirmed by calculating the average values and mean square errors of PCEs from 10 devices, which are 10.6% ± 0.1%, 15.5% ± 0.1% and 15.5% ± 0.1% for PM6:IT6-4F-, PM6:AY6- and PM6:Y6-based OSCs, respectively.

Fig. 4c shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the three OSCs. Among them, PM6:IT6-4F-based OSCs exhibit a relatively lower and narrower EQE spectrum compared to those of PM6:AY6- and PM6:Y6-based OSCs, which agrees with their low Jsc. Although the absorption range of AY6 is blue-shifted relative to that of Y6, it exhibits more complement spectral coverage with the polymer donor PM6, which leads to maximum EQE values exceeding 80% for PM6:AY6-based OSCs across the range from 640 nm to 790 nm. However, the Jsc of PM6:AY6-based OSCs is inevitably lower than that of PM6:Y6-based OSCs due to the blue-shifted EQE spectrum. The EQE-integrated Jscs of OSCs based on PM6:IT6-4F, PM6:AY6 and PM6:Y6 are 16.03, 22.72 and 24.01 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the measured Jscs within a reasonable error.
2.6 Device characterization
Photocurrent density (Jph) against effective applied voltage (Veff) was measured to understand two important processes of exciton dissociation and charge extraction in the three OSCs. The basic principle of this measurement can be described as follows:65Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are photocurrent densities under the conditions of illumination and dark, respectively. Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Vbias is the applied external voltage bias. The built-in electric field will be enlarged with the increase of Veff; as a result, the dissociative charges move fast toward the corresponding electrodes and collected with minimal recombination. As revealed in Fig. 4d, the Jphs reach saturation (Jsat) when Veff is higher than 4.0 V, which are 17.72, 24.30 and 26.05 mA cm−2 for IT6-4F-, AY6- and Y6-based OSCs, respectively. Moreover, the efficiencies of exciton dissociation (Pdiss) and charge collection (Pcoll), evaluated by the specific values of Jph/Jsat under short circuit and maximum power output conditions, respectively, are 94.2/82.5% for IT6-4F devices, 96.9/88.5% for AY6 devices and 94.7/83.5% for Y6 devices, respectively (the Jphs under short-circuit and maximal power output conditions are 16.69/14.62 mA cm−2 for IT6-4F devices, 23.54/21.50 mA cm−2 for AY6 devices and 24.66/21.75 mA cm−2 for Y6 devices, respectively).

J
sc as a function of light intensity (P) was plotted (Fig. 4e) to understand the degree of bimolecular recombination in the three OSCs. Generally, the P dependence of Jsc can be described as Jsc ∝ PS,66 where S is in correlation with the bimolecular recombination degree. Specifically, the closer S is to 1, the more free charge carriers can be swept out and effectively collected in individual electrodes prior to recombination. It can be clearly observed from Fig. 4e that the Jsc was highly linear correlated with P on a double logarithmic scale for the three OSCs with slopes (S) being 0.93, 0.97 and 0.94 for IT6-4F-, AY6- and Y6-based OSCs, indicating that PM6:AY6-based OSCs achieved the smallest bimolecular recombination among the three devices.
In addition, to gain insights into the charge transport behaviors of the three OSCs, the electron and hole mobilities of IT6-4F, AY6 and Y6 neat and blend films were investigated by fabricating electron-only (ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDIN/Al) and hole-only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoOx/Ag) diodes. By fitting the data using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. S5†), the electron mobilities of IT6-4F, AY6 and Y6 pure films are estimated to be 4.46 × 10−5, 5.16 × 10−4 and 6.63 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. A significant improvement of electron mobility from IT6-4F to AY6 can be observed by replacing BDC (in IT6-4F) with BTP (in Y6). When polymer PM6 was incorporated, blend films based on PM6:IT6-4F, PM6:AY6 and PM6:Y6 show hole/electron (μh/μe) mobilities of 4.55 × 10−5/5.14 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, 3.75 × 10−4/8.62 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.12 × 10−4/1.25 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 with μh/μe being 8.85, 4.35 and 4.90, respectively. In addition, the average hole/electron mobilities based on five devices (Table S4†) were calculated, which are (3.70 ± 0.21) × 10−4/(8.62 ± 0.3) × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PM6:AY6-based OSCs and (6.07 ± 0.21) × 10−4/(1.21 ± 0.12) × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PM6:Y6-based OSCs, with μh/μe being 4.29 and 5.01, respectively. It can be seen that asymmetrical AY6 enhances the balance of carrier transfer compared to Y6. In general, the higher Pdiss and Pcoll, lower bimolecular recombination degree and more balanced hole and electron mobilities in PM6:AY6-based OSCs are beneficial to the enhancement of their FF.
2.7 Morphology study
Atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements were performed to gain insights into the information of the surface morphology for neat and blend films, and the corresponding height and phase images are displayed in Fig. 5. It can be clearly observed that the AY6 neat film exhibits a smooth surface with a small root-mean-square (RMS) of 1.27 nm but an uneven morphology with many holes (Fig. 5b), while the Y6 neat film forms large grains, which are uniformly distributed but significantly rougher (RMS = 2.96 nm) than the AY6 neat film (Fig. 5c). From further comparison between their phase images (Fig. 5g and h), we can safely judge that the crystallization properties of AY6 are weaker than those of Y6. When PM6 is incorporated into AY6, the morphology of the PM6:AY6 blend film (Fig. 5d) changes greatly compared to that of the AY6 neat film (Fig. 5b) but close to that of the PM6 neat film (Fig. 5a) with an enhanced crystallization degree (Fig. 5f and h). For the PM6:Y6 blend film, large grains are still present (Fig. 5e and j) though RMS reduces (2.47 nm). Moreover, the smooth and uniform morphology (RMS = 1.38 nm) and well-developed nanofiber network structures in the PM6:AY6 active layer are beneficial to the improvement of FF.

It is generally acknowledged that a good micromorphology of the active layer is conducive to achieving a high FF of OSCs. In order to understand the packing difference between the three SMAs caused by their different molecular structures and configurations, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) experiments were performed. The 2D GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding cut-line profiles for neat and blend films are shown in Fig. 6 and 7, respectively. It can be observed from Fig. 6e that the three SMAs exhibit different orientations toward the substrate in their neat films. IT6-4F shows a mixed orientation including face-on and edge-on, which is evidenced by the weak (010) diffraction peaks in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. Y6 displays a preferable face-on orientation with a strong and regular diffraction halo in the qz direction (Fig. 6d). However, the molecular packing of AY6 reveals an amorphous state with no diffraction signal appearing, which differs greatly from IT6-4F and Y6. As far as we know, planar ITIC whose two end groups are distributed in an anti-conformation along the long axis of the molecule (similar to AY6) possesses good π–π stacking in the qz direction.1 So, we assumed that the poor molecular stacking of AY6 is caused by its non-coplanar core and configuration of end groups (X-shape), which results in a significant blue-shift of absorption relative to that of Y6. Parameters of d-spacing and coherence lengths extracted from cut-line profiles are 3.59/9.6 Å for the IT6-4F neat film and 3.85/16.8 Å for the Y6 neat film. Though the π–π stacking of Y6 is not as dense as that of IT6-4F, it is more ordered than that of IT6-4F.

Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of the three active layers (Fig. 7d–f) reveal a uniform and smooth surface morphology and well-developed nanofiber structures, indicating that PM6 possesses good morphological compatibility with the three SMAs. Generally, the stacking information of the active layer is a summation of packing features from both the polymer donor and SMAs. PM6 shows a coexistence of face-on and edge-on orientation with a broad spreading for both π–π and (100) stacking in the out-of-plane direction. By comparing Fig. 7a with Fig. 6a and b, we can conclude that the π–π stacking of the PM6:IT6-4F blend film is enhanced. Though the (100) diffraction peak of the PM6:IT6-4F-based blend film in the out-of-plane direction is weakened compared to that of PM6, which indicates that the face-on character increases, the PM6:IT6-4F blend film exhibits the same orientation as PM6 and IT6-4F, which is not beneficial to the improvement of FF. The PM6:Y6 blend film displays a good face-on orientation with a strong (010) diffraction peak in the out-of-plane direction and a weak (100) diffraction peak in the in-plane direction, which facilitates the vertical transport of charge carriers. Thus, PM6:Y6-based OSCs can achieve higher hole and electron mobilities and FF than PM6:IT6-4F-based OSCs. When PM6 was incorporated into AY6, two significant changes occurred in the molecular packing of the blend film compared to the corresponding pure film. On one hand, although neither AY6 nor PM6 shows face-on orientations, the PM6:AY6 blend film exhibits a perfect face-on orientation. On the other hand, the π–π stacking of the PM6:AY6 blend film is obviously stronger than that of both PM6 and AY6, especially AY6, by comparing Fig. 7b with Fig. 6a and c. The analysis of cut-line profiles in Fig. 7g reveals that the coherence lengths of π–π stacking in the out-of-plane direction and lamellar packing in the in-plane direction are 16.9/89.1 Å for PM6:AY6 and 15.4/76.7 Å for PM6:Y6, indicating that the order of packing for PM6:AY6 is even stronger than that of PM6:AY6, which is consistent with the fact that PM6:AY6-based OSCs achieved higher FF than PM6:Y6-based OSCs.
It should be noted that the d-spacing of the PM6:AY6 blend film (3.47 Å) is much shorter than that of the PM6:Y6 blend film (3.94 Å), which implies that asymmetrical AY6 significantly changes the intermolecular packing of the active layer with respect to Y6. To figure out the reasons why this abnormal phenomenon occurs in the PM6:AY6 system, we conducted an in-depth analysis. Assuming that there is no intermolecular interaction between PM6 and AY6, good donor and acceptor phases will be formed during the film formation, that is, the crystalline PM6 phase and the amorphous AY6. In this case, the diffraction signal of the PM6:AY6 blend film should be similar to that of PM6, which is contrary to the data we have obtained. Therefore, we believe that there is an interaction between PM6 and AY6 promoting the formation of a new phase, that is, the intermixed phase in which AY6 can stack with polymer PM6. It is precisely because AY6 is not easy to crystallize that AY6 has an opportunity to approach PM6 and is more likely to stack with the polymer during the evaporation of solvent molecules. This can be supported by the shorter d-spacing of the PM6:AY6 blend film (3.47 Å) than that of neat PM6 (3.60 Å). Moreover, the AY6 molecule is much smaller than the PM6 polymer, and thus the supporting force for PM6 to stand on the substrate that AY6 can afford will be significantly smaller than that of the PM6 polymer (because the number of alkyl chains on a polymer is much larger than that of SMAs). As a result, the intermixed phase is more inclined to lie on the substrate to form a face-on orientation.
3. Conclusion
In summary, a new asymmetrical SMA, namely AY6, was designed and synthesized by combining the asymmetrical structure of IT6-4F with high-performance Y6. Through the cross-conceptual design strategy, PM6:AY6-based OSCs achieved a significantly higher PCE (15.6%) than PM6:IT6-4F-based OSCs (10.8%) and a higher FF than PM6:Y6-based OSCs (increased from 74.5% to 76.3%), indicating the effectiveness of this method. DFT calculations reveal that AY6 with two end groups in an anti-conformation possesses an X-shape molecular configuration, which differs greatly from Y-shape Y6. The poor crystallization properties of AY6 were confirmed by GIWAXS experiment, which well explains why the AY6 neat film shows a notable spectral blue shift compared to Y6. However, the PM6:AY6 blend film shows a perfect face-on orientation with a stronger π–π stacking than that of the PM6:Y6 blend film; therefore, PM6:AY6-based OSCs achieved higher exciton dissociation efficiency and more balanced carrier transport compared to PM6:Y6-based OSCs, which promotes the FF. Moreover, the huge change of molecular packing from the AY6 neat film to a blend film can be attributed to the formation of a new intermixed phase in which AY6 stacks with PM6. The significance of asymmetrical AY6 lies in that it not only boosts the PCE of asymmetrical SMA-based OSCs but also promotes the FF of OSCs based on Y6-like FREAs.
