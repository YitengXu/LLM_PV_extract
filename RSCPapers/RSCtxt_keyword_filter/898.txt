Broader context
For dye-sensitized solar cells made with some medium-sized single-electron redox couples, it is still a big challenge to enhance the capacity of capturing solar photons while at the same time control the separation and recombination of charges at the functional nanojunction. Herein we demonstrate the extraordinary merit of devising a bulky pinhole defect filler to retard the charge transfer reaction of titania electrons with oxidizing species in the redox electrolytes. The strategy of filling pinhole defects in the grafted dye layer on the surface of titania presented here to attenuate the interfacial charge recombination could be extended to cells based upon other light-absorbers, shedding light on further performance enhancement.

Widespread attention has been caught on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs)1 to support the coming sustainable energy supply, in the worldwide theme of searching for low-cost, eco-friendly technologies of converting the solar energy to electricity. Ruthenium(II) polypyridine (N749) and zinc porphyrin (YD2-o-C8) complexes have been demonstrated thus far to be the most efficient photosensitizers in DSCs.2 Meanwhile, owing to the wide availability of raw materials and the grand flexibility of molecular tailoring, metal-free organic dyes also have been actively pursued and impressive advances have been attained in the few past years.3 In this regard, the elongation of π-conjugated segments is one common strategy to enhance the light harvesting capacity apart from the elaborate choice of electron donors and acceptors. Through introducing the electron rich segment of hexyl-substituted cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) featuring a three-dimensional configuration into a push–pull dye, we have synthesized a model dye coded as C218 (Fig. 1), which exhibits a fairly good performance in both iodine and iodine-free DSCs.4,5 However, that dye features a narrow spectral response to solar irradiance, limiting the photocurrent output. Thereby, in this contribution we will extend our work by employing a longer conjugated π-linker containing CPDT, i.e. 2,6-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-4,4-dodecyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene, to construct a new dye (C256, Fig. 1) featuring a higher absorption coefficient and a wider spectral response compared to C218 (Fig. S1A and Table S1).† Taking into account the extraordinary merit of devising bulky dyes to improve the open-circuit photovoltage of cells with medium-sized single-electron redox shuttles,2b,6 we have deployed two longer dodecyl substituents in place of hexyl on the CPDT segment and a diethylfluorenyl fragment instead of phenyl on the bisarylamino unit.

Unluckily, our preliminary experiment has shown that the new dye possesses a very low solubility in the traditional dye-bath solvent of mixed acetonitrile and tert-butanol (v/v, 1/1) for C218, probably owing to the stronger dye–dye intermolecular interaction. Hence, we were initially obliged to use the saturated solution of C256 in the solvent mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butanol (v/v, 1/1) for the titania film dyeing, and first inspected the photocurrent action spectra (Fig. 2A) of cells based on C218 (cell 1) and C256 (cell 2) in conjunction with a tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt (Co–phen) redox couple. The details of the cell fabrication are described in the ESI.† The dye transformation from C218 to C256 brings forth a ∼30 nm red-shifting of the photocurrent onset-wavelength, benefiting from an augmented maximum molar absorption coefficient at a longer wavelength (Fig. S1A).† However, the C256 cell displays a lower summit (∼80%) of incident photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) compared to that of C218 (∼85%).
 Fig. 2  (A) Photocurrent action spectra of cells 1, 2, 4 and 8. (B) j–V characteristics of cells 1, 2, 4, 8 and 9 measured under an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM1.5 sunlight. Cells 1 and 2 were made with the titania films grafted with C218 and C256 from the solvent mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butanol (v/v, 1/1), respectively; cells 4 and 9 were made with the titania films grafted with C256 from chlorobenzene and pinhole defect filler III from acetonitrile, respectively; cell 8 was made with the titania film sequentially co-grafted with C256 from chlorobenzene and pinhole defect filler III from acetonitrile. The details of the cell fabrication can be found in the ESI.† An antireflection film was adhered to a testing cell during measurement. All cells were tested with a metal shadow mask having an aperture area of 0.160 cm2. 
Considering a saturated light harvesting in the spectral region from 400 to 560 nm for the C218 and C256 cells (Fig. S1B),† we resorted to the femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion technique to examine the interfacial electron injection processes,7 see ESI for details (Fig. S2 and Table S3).† The amplitude-averaged lifetimes 〈τ〉alumina of control cells with the nanoporous alumina films are 50.9 ps for C218 and 18.7 ps for C256, and cells with the titania films display significant shorter 〈τ〉titania, being 4.0 and 3.0 ps for C218 and C256. Thereby, the electron injection yeilds (ϕei) at the titania–dye interface can be roughly estimated in terms of the equation ϕei = 1 − 〈τ〉titania/〈τ〉alumina, being 92% and 84% for titania cells with C218 and C256, respectively. The relatively lower electron injection yield could trigger an unfavorable influence on the IPCE summit. On the other hand, it is known that the hole injection yield (ϕhi) determined by the kinetic competition involving the oxidized dye, i.e. its hole transfer either to cobalt(II) or titania, may also impact the IPCE maximum.8 Thus, we switched to a tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt (Co–bpy) electrolyte which has a ∼70 mV more negative redox potential than that of Co–phen, to fabricate a C256–Co–bpy cell (cell 3), which presents a comparable summit of IPCE with respect to the C256–Co–phen congener (cell 2, Fig. S3A),† implying that the hole injection yield does not control the IPCE summit, which was measured under lower light irradiances.
We further evaluated the photovoltaic performance of cells 1, 2 and 3 by measuring the photocurrent density–voltage (j–V) characteristics (Fig. 2B) under an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM1.5 sunlight, and the detailed cell parameters were tabulated in Table S4.† The C218 model dye exhibits a short-circuit photocurrent density (jsc) of 14.81 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 889 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.716, generating a power conversion efficiency (η) of 9.4%. The C256 dye shows a 31 mV improved Voc benefitting from its bulkier character, which endows the cell with prolonged electron lifetimes as shown in Fig. S4.† Nevertheless, the C256 dye displays a lower jsc of 13.36 mA cm−2 and a smaller FF of 0.664, resulting in a remarkably reduced η of 8.2%. As depicted in Fig. S3C,† the jsc values for the C218 dye present a linear dependence on the irradiances (G) of simulated AM1.5 sunlight, and are very close to the predicted photocurrent densities (jcalcsc) by integrating its IPCE measured at lower light irradiances over the whole AM1.5 spectrum; however, for the C256 dye there is a sublinear relationship between jsc and G, i.e. a 1.94 mA cm−2 smaller experimental value under full sunlight compared to jcalcsc. This observation has suggested non-unity hole injection efficiencies for cell 2 at higher light irradiances.9 The employment of a Co–bpy electrolyte can improve the hole injection efficiency, endowing the cell with an enhanced jsc from 13.36 to 15.18 mA cm−2 (Fig. S3B).† This can be ascribed to the more negative redox potential of Co–bpy, which could accelerate the dye regeneration rate. However, the usage of the Co–bpy electrolyte with a more negative equilibrium potential gives rise to an over 50 mV decreased Voc, resulting in an η improvement just from 8.2 to 8.9%.
To surmount the inferior electron and hole injection yields induced by the poor solubility of C256 in the dye-bath solvent of acetonitrile and tert-butanol, we decided to employ a “good” dye-bath solvent, chlorobenzene, in which the interactions between dye segments and solvent molecules are energetically favorable, to fabricate cells with the C256 dye and the Co–phen electrolyte. The employment of a good solvent for dyeing can prevent the aggregation of dye molecules on the surface of titania,10 improving the electron and hole injection yields.10d As expected, cell 4 with chlorobenzene as the dye-bath solvent presents an improved summit of IPCE (∼85%) compared to that with acetonitrile and tert-butanol (∼80%) in Fig. 2A, owing to the enhanced electron injection yield (Fig. S2 and Table S3),† which is offered by the decreased dye loading amount on the titania surface. Moreover, the diminishment of dye loading amount by use of a good solvent eliminates the sublinear photocurrent characteristics observed in cell 2 with the mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butanol as the dye-bath solvent, endowing the chlorobenzene processed cell 4 with a remarkably improved jsc of 15.46 mA cm−2 and also an excellent FF of 0.747. However, cell 4 displays a significantly decreased Voc of 822 mV compared to cell 2 (920 mV). We image that the employment of a good solvent may bring forth some pinhole defects in the dye layer on the titania surface, which, as pictorially illustrated in the upper panel of Scheme 1, allow the cobalt(III) ions to be in close proximity to the titania, speeding up the interfacial charge recombination.
 Scheme 1  Pictorial illustration for self-organized molecules on titania via (upper) one-step grafting with dyes dissolved in a good solvent, and (bottom) pinhole defect filling with a suitable filler dissolved in a poor solvent. Pinhole defects arising from the one-step process allow the cobalt(III) ions to be in close proximity to titania, speeding up the interfacial charge recombination, which is expected to be abated by the compact organic coating formed via the protocol of pinhole defect filling. 
Thereby we must repair the pinhole defects with an appropriate filler, which should feature a high capacity of considerably slowing down the interfacial charge recombination. Also, the bath solvent for a filler must be a poor host for dyes, avoiding dye desorption during the filling process. We screened acetonitrile as the filler bath solvent and compared three fillers with the cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group (filler I, 2-cyano-3-(4-(dodecyloxy)phenyl)acrylic acid; filler II, 3-(5-(4-(bis(4-(hexyloxy)phenyl)amino)phenyl)thiophen-2-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid; filler III, 3-(5-(5-(4-(bis(4-(hexyloxy)phenyl)amino)phenyl)-3-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-4-hexylthiophen-2-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid; see Fig. 3A for their structure details). Their retarding abilities toward the charge transfer reaction of titania electrons with Co(III) ions were first evaluated by measuring the dark current density–voltage characteristics. As depicted in Fig. 3B, with respect to the bare control, there is a more or less reduction of dark current for all filler-grafted titania films at a given potential bias. The dark current stepwise becomes small along with the increase of molecular volume from filler I to filler II and then to filler III. We have also found that the conventional coadsorbates such as Cheno11 and DINHOP12 are similar to filler I but far from the power of fillers II and III in terms of dark current control.

(B) j–V characteristics in the dark for cells employing the bare and grafted titania films with fillers I, II and III in combination with a Co–phen electrolyte. (C) Intensities of the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 photoelectrons emitted from the bare and filler-grafted titania films. (D) Measured (symbols) and simulated (solid line) X-ray reflectivity curves for the bare and filler-grafted ALD titania films. For clarity, each curve is offset by 10−2 with respect to the previous one. 
To gain a fundamental understanding of the different capacity of fillers I, II and III, we carried out the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments13 to record the intensities (I) of Ti2p signals, which could be nicely associated with the charge recombination between the titania electrons and electron capture species in electrolytes.6d,10d,e,14 As depicted in Fig. 3C, all the samples with filler grafting show evident attenuations of both Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 signals in comparison to the bare control, owing to the damping effect on the escape of photoelectrons from titania to the vacuum. Moreover, fillers II and III display obviously lower Ti2p signal intensities with respect to filler I, which is consistent with the aforementioned tendency of the dark current. Assuming a compact organic layer on titania, the mean thickness of a compressed filler layer on the titania surface can be calculated, being 11.2 Å for filler I, 32.6 Å for filler II and 37.2 Å for filler III, respectively (see ESI for details).†
We also performed X-ray reflectivity measurements to elaborate the thickness of fillers grafted on a planar ALD-grown titania surface.15 As presented in Fig. 3D, a two-layer model was employed to fit the reflectivity profiles of filler-grafted ALD titania films and the refined structural parameters were compiled in Table S5.† The calculated mean thicknesses are 10.3, 15.4, and 18.7 Å for fillers I, II and III, respectively. On the other hand, along with the increase in molecular volume, the mass density of the filler layer becomes small, being 2.0, 1.5 and 1.4 g cm−3 for fillers I, II and III, respectively, indicating that a filler with a bulkier three-dimensional character tends to form a larger porosity for the molecular layer on titania. Combining with the aforementioned dark current characteristics, we could speculate that the diameter of resultant pores should be smaller than that of cobalt(III) ions, and the charge recombination should be controlled by the molecular layer thickness influencing the electron tunnelling distance.
Using acetonitrile as the bath solvent for filler I, II or III, we further scrutinized their capacity of filling the pinhole defects of the titania films grafted with C256 from chlorobenzene. In line with the preceding observation on interfacial charge recombination abatement, the pinhole defect filling with filler II or III confers an evidently improved Voc, see ESI for details (Table S4 and Fig. S6C).† It is noted that cell 6 with filler I does not present an improved Voc but a decreased jsc, the latter of which results from a slightly reduced light absorption, leading to a decreased η of 9.3%. Notably, cell 8 made by dyeing a titania film with C256 from chlorobenzene and subsequently filling the pinhole defects with filler III exhibits the highest Voc, and thus becomes the focus in the following discussion. Its photocurrent action spectrum is also collected in Fig. 2A for comparison. Apart from a comparable IPCE summit of ∼85%, cell 8 with filler III has higher IPCEs in the shoulder region compared to cell 4 made with C256 alone from chlorobenzene. In addition, the electronic absorption of a titania film with C256 and filler III does not alter too much with respect to that with C256 alone (Fig. S6B),† suggesting that the additional use of filler III should evoke a higher electron collection efficiency.
The j–V characteristics of cell 8 under an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM1.5 sunlight is visualized in Fig. 2B, and the detailed parameters are listed in Table S4.† The cell based upon a titania film grafted with filler III alone from acetonitrile was also included as reference. Cell 8 exhibits a notably improved Voc of 904 mV concomitant with a slightly increased jsc of 15.74 mA cm−2 in comparison with its control (cell 4) (Voc: 822 mV; jsc: 15.46 mA cm−2), resulting in an η improvement from 9.5% to 10.5%. Under lower light irradiances, cell 8 has even higher efficiencies up to 11.2%. Cell 9 with filler III alone presents the highest Voc of 1001 mV, again proving the extraordinary merit of filler III on inhibiting interfacial charge recombination. To verify the peculiar merit of the strategy of pinhole defect filling presented here for C256, we also performed a parallel test of one-step co-grafting of this dye with filler III in the mixed dye-bath solvent of acetonitrile and tert-butanol (v/v, 1/1). The jsc, Voc, FF and η of the corresponding control device (cell 10) are 15.05 mA cm−2, 888 mV, 0.710 and 9.5%, respectively.
We further performed transient photovoltage decay measurements to dissect the origins of the aforementioned fluctuation of Voc for cells 4, 8 and 9. As illustrated in Fig. 4A, at the same Voc or potential bias, it is easy to perceive that cell 9 presents the longest electron lifetime (τn), and cell 8 exhibits one order of magnitude longer τn with respect to cell 4. This result has suggested that with respect to cell 4, cell 8 processed via the strategy of pinhole defect filling with filler III has less titania surface accessible by cobalt(III) ions as illustrated in Scheme 1. This ratiocination can also be supported by XPS measurements. As shown in Fig. 4B, an evident decrease of the Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 signals is noted for the pinhole defect filling of the C256-grafted titania film with filler III.

The attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectrum measurements were carried out to understand the adsorption pattern of C256 and filler III on the titania surface. As shown in Fig. S7,† two new absorption bands stemming from the carboxylate asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations can be observed for the grafted titania films, and the carbonyl absorption bands of C256 and filler III are not probed, ruling out the possibility of weak adsorption of molecules on the titania surface in our samples. The IR analysis has also shown that during the pinhole filling process, a considerable amount of filler III is anchored on the surface of titania.
We also extended the strategy of pinhole defect filling with filler III for some of typical narrow energy-gap photosensitizers previously reported by us, including C229, C219, C249 and C250 (Fig. S8).† The details of cell fabrication were presented in the ESI.† The j–V characteristics under an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM1.5 sunlight are presented in Fig. S9A–D,† and the detailed parameters are listed in Table S4.† The pinhole defect filling with filler III typically confers an improvement of Voc in the range from 56 to 94 mV, jsc in the range from 0.18 to 2.83 mA cm−2, and η in the range from 0.5% to 2.4% compared to the control cells with the corresponding narrow energy-gap dyes alone.
To summarize, we have demonstrated a general strategy of filling the pinhole defects of dye-grafted titania films via judiciously selecting a filler as well as its bath solvent to enhance the performance of organic dye-sensitized solar cells with a cobalt electrolyte. By employing the bulky, high absorption coefficient organic dye C256 in combination with the pinhole defect filler III featuring a three-dimensional character, we have achieved an impressive solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 10.5% for organic dye-sensitized solar cells under AM1.5 full sunlight. The strategy of filling pinhole defects presented here to attenuate the interfacial charge recombination could be extended to cells based upon other light-absorbers, semiconducting electrodes and hole-transporting materials, paving a new avenue for the performance enhancement of mesoscopic solar cells.

For dye-sensitized solar cells made with some medium-sized single-electron redox couples, it is still a big challenge to enhance the capacity of capturing solar photons while at the same time control the separation and recombination of charges at the functional nanojunction. Herein we demonstrate the extraordinary merit of devising a bulky pinhole defect filler to retard the charge transfer reaction of titania electrons with oxidizing species in the redox electrolytes. The strategy of filling pinhole defects in the grafted dye layer on the surface of titania presented here to attenuate the interfacial charge recombination could be extended to cells based upon other light-absorbers, shedding light on further performance enhancement.

All cells were tested with a metal shadow mask having an aperture area of 0.160 cm2.	 

 	Scheme 1  Pictorial illustration for self-organized molecules on titania via (upper) one-step grafting with dyes dissolved in a good solvent, and (bottom) pinhole defect filling with a suitable filler dissolved in a poor solvent. Pinhole defects arising from the one-step process allow the cobalt(III) ions to be in close proximity to titania, speeding up the interfacial charge recombination, which is expected to be abated by the compact organic coating formed via the protocol of pinhole defect filling.	 

 	Fig. 3  (A) Molecular structures of three pinhole defect fillers compared in this work. (B) j–V characteristics in the dark for cells employing the bare and grafted titania films with fillers I, II and III in combination with a Co–phen electrolyte. (C) Intensities of the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 photoelectrons emitted from the bare and filler-grafted titania films. (D) Measured (symbols) and simulated (solid line) X-ray reflectivity curves for the bare and filler-grafted ALD titania films. For clarity, each curve is offset by 10−2 with respect to the previous one.	 

 	Fig. 4  (A) Electron lifetime (τ) plotted as a function of open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) for cells 4, 8 and 9. (B) Intensities of the Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 photoelectrons emitted from the bare, C256, filler III and C256 + filler III grafted titania films.
