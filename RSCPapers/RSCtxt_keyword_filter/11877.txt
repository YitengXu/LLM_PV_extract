1. Introduction
Since the pioneering work of Shirakawa, Heeger and McDiarmid in the 1970's,1 the interest in organic π-conjugated systems has grown tremendously.2 Indeed organic materials offer the possibility to process light-weight, flexible electronic devices, however, they have to satisfy a large number of technical requirements in order to be stable and efficient in the device.3 For example, they have to give a pin-hole free homogenous layer by vacuum sublimation or wet processing, be stable under electric fields, undergo balanced charge carrier injection to and from both electrodes and be thermally stable. In order to satisfy all the technical requirements and obtain efficient materials with high absorption, conductivity, and photoluminescence quantum yield, chemists have synthesized and studied a large amount of chemical structures and some of them have been successfully used in devices.4 The HOMO–LUMO gap can be easily tuned by extension/modification of the π-conjugated system. Also, the properties of the conjugated systems can be further modified by grafting lateral substituents on the π-conjugated backbone. These side chains can have supramolecular, steric or electronic effects that not only change the electronic properties but also the solubility and the solid-state packing.5 The insertion of a heteroelement into the backbone has also appeared to be an appealing method to tune the properties of the materials. Heterocycles like thiophene, pyrrole, and their derivatives are now widely used to modify the chemical and physical properties of π-conjugated systems.2 Interestingly, while organophosphorus derivatives have been investigated for decades, their insertion into devices has only been achieved recently.6,7 The word phosphorus comes from ancient greek phos (“light”) and phorus (“bringing”) due to the intense light emitted by white phosphorus (P4). It is ironic to note that the element whose name is etymologically linked to “phosphor” and “phosphorescence” was scarcely used in emitting devices before the beginning of this century. The high reactivity and toxicity of many P-derivatives is the main reason. The ability of chemists to stabilize and protect the P-atom allowed the introduction of organophosphorus derivatives into opto-electronic devices.
The present article does not aim to review all the different kinds of organophosphorus based materials,7 but only those that have been inserted into electronic devices (organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photovoltaic cells (OPV cells), dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and electrochromic cells). Indeed, despite the interesting work on some organophosphorus π-conjugated materials like phosphalkenes8 or diphosphenes9 none of these derivatives have ever been used in electronic devices, most likely due to the poor stability of the CP and PP bonds. Only five types of organophosphorus materials have made the cut: triaryl phosphines, phosphazenes, phospholes, phosphetes and diphosphacyclobutanes (Fig. 1). This review will mainly focus on two types of opto-electronic devices: OLEDs, where the use of P-containing materials is now widely developed, and solar cells (either OPV cells or DSSCs).10 The case of OFETs and electrochemical cells will also be addressed but they are more particular, as only specific examples were found in the literature.

2. Phosphines
Helped by their extensive use as ligands in transition metal catalysis, the aryl phosphine building block is the most studied group of the organophosphorus materials. It has been shown that the lone pair of P is slightly involved in the delocalization within the conjugated system.11 This is due to the tetrahedral shape of phosphorus and its high inversion barrier (30–35 kcal mol−1). Furthermore the lone pair tends to quench the luminescence and these compounds rarely exhibit high fluorescence quantum yield. That is why only a few examples were found for σ3–λ3 phosphines used as emitters.12 Above all, σ3–λ3 phosphines are sensitive to oxidation, which clearly alter their stability in a device. This problem is overcome by oxidizing the phosphine to its σ4–λ5 phosphine oxide analog. Even though the oxidation breaks the delocalization, their chemical stability and electronic affinity make them valuable compounds for the development of electron transport layers (ETLs) and host materials in optoelectronic devices. This field has been reviewed in 2012 by Jeon et al.13 That is why only compounds leading to outstanding performances (external quantum efficiency (EQE) > 20%) and some of the latest compounds published will be described here.
2.1. As charge transport layers
The role of a charge transport layer is to ensure electron or hole injection and transportation from the electrodes to the active layer of the device. The first study of a phosphine used as a charge transport layer dates back to 2001.6 The authors showed that π-extended arylphosphines used as hole transport layers (HTLs) showed a better performance in OLEDs than their nitrogen analogs. However, their oxidized version (phosphine oxides) is mainly used for their electron transport ability as the high polarity of the PO group makes it electron withdrawing. In this case, the LUMO of the ETL has to be low enough to ensure electron injection from the electrode. In addition, phosphine oxides are stable toward oxidation. For example, a simple triphenylphosphine oxide, Ph3PO, was used in a OLED structure by Ha et al. in 2008.14 The results show that Ph3PO has great electron transport ability and that the driving voltage for the luminance output is reduced by using a Ph3PO layer over an Alq3 layer. Pyridine based phosphine oxides were also investigated.15 This family of derivatives exhibits electron transport properties and hole blocking ability due to deep HOMO levels. The association of the PO moiety with pyrenes (1, Fig. 2) able to π-stack gave phosphine oxide improved electron transport ability, as reported by Oyamada et al.16 Furthermore it was shown that the co-deposition of this phosphine oxide 1 with cesium creates a charge transfer complex and enhances conductivity in the device (ITO/α-NPB/Alq3/1:Cs/Al) by improving electron injection at the interface with aluminum. Many spirobifluorene based phosphine oxide analogs were developed as ETLs for OLEDs. For example, 2 and 4 (Fig. 2) were used in OLEDs as universal ETLs because they were able to reduce the driving voltage whatever the host was for the adjacent emissive layer (EML).17 The relatively high LUMO level (−2.4 eV) of phosphine oxide makes it suitable for electron injection in any host material. Many of these spirobifluorenes were used as ETLs in OLEDs as well as host matrices for triplet emitters in devices (see 2.2).18–20
 Fig. 2  Electron transport materials for OLEDs and OPV cells. 
Spirobenzofluorene based phosphine oxide 5 (Fig. 2) has been used as an ETL in an OPV cell (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/5/Al) in order to improve performances (Fig. 2).21 The use of this interlayer protects the active polymer from Al diffusion into the active layer leading to higher performances, and especially better open circuit voltage (Voc). The coordination ability of the phosphine oxide onto the Al surface leads to band bending which also explains the Voc improvement. Performance improvement was also observed when the LiF layer was replaced by 2 (Fig. 2).22 The structure of another universal ETL was recently published, based on arylsilyl and phosphine oxide groups (3) (Fig. 2).23 In this compound, the Si atom breaks the conjugation. The compound thus possesses relatively high LUMO levels (−2.52 eV) for electron injection in most hosts, deep HOMO levels (−6.79 eV) for hole blocking, and high triplet energy levels (ET) (−3.36 eV) for triplet blocking. A high external quantum yield (EQE) was achieved using 3 (Fig. 2) as an ETL in a blue phosphorescent OLED (PHOLED).
2.2. As matrices for phosphorescent complexes
Designing efficient hosts for triplet emitters in OLEDs implies several requirements: in addition to the chemical and physical stability, the compound must carry both holes and electrons (balanced charge transport) and have a suitable triplet energy level in order to transfer energy to the triplet emitter (usually an iridium complex, see ESI†).24 Following the work developed by Padmaperuma et al. on ETLs for OLEDs,6 phosphine oxides mainly gained interest as host matrices for triplet emitters. The PO moiety is used as an electron-withdrawing group to ensure the electron transport in association with an electron rich group that will transport the holes (usually an amine). Furthermore, the tetrahedral shape and the lack of conjugation through the PO group do not affect the triplet energy of the molecule which remains high. This allows energy transfer from the host to the phosphorescent dopant. Since the first report of an arylphosphine oxide as a host for a blue triplet emitter in 2006 by Burrows et al.,25 many derivatives were studied.
Highly efficient phosphine oxide based hosts include generally in their structure carbazole units, π-extended units (like spirobifluorene), and/or a silyl group. Due to its good hole transporting ability, the carbazole unit has been associated with a phosphine oxide, to prepare a host matrix with balanced charged transport. Substitution on the carbazole by phosphine oxide units at positions 2 and 7 (6) (Fig. 3 and Table 1) lowers the gap compared to a 3,6 substitution but even though it lowers the driving voltage,26 it allows high performances with light blue triplet emitters. It also lowers the ET, resulting in lower efficiency for deep blue triplet emitters. N,N′-Dicarbazolyl-3,5-benzene (mCP) modification with phosphine oxides overcomes poor electron transport and thermal stability of mCP while maintaining high ET.27,28 Deep blue PHOLEDs with high efficiency using FCNIr were achieved with these two hosts. Actually 8 (Fig. 3 and Table 1) is one of the most efficient deep blue hosts for both vacuum and solution processed PHOLEDs.29 Han et al. studied several different hosts for red, green and blue triplet emitters based on the “carbazole–phosphine oxide” approach by tuning the π-linker.30 They were able to modulate both transport properties and the T1/S1 energy level in order to efficiently transfer energy from the singlet state to the triplet state of the emitter. The triphenylphosphine oxide substituted by two carbazole units (7, Fig. 3 and Table 1) possesses destabilized HOMOs and LUMOs compared to those of other hosts based also on carbazole but they retain high ET and bipolar charge transport. Compound 7 was found to be an efficient host for the three primary color triplet emitters, especially for light blue FIrpic. Polymeric hosts based on the carbazole scaffold were also studied, where Shao et al. synthesized a triphenylphosphine oxide polymer with a carbazole side chain, P1 (Fig. 3 and Table 1).31 This polymer showed balanced charge transport and high Tg. Efficiency close to 1% was achieved using a single layer structure. This result was further improved to 10.8% when a hole blocking layer was inserted into the device. 1,2,4-Triazole has also been associated with phosphine oxide and carbazole. In order to maintain a high T1 level, the carbazole was coupled in the meta position of the triazole core in 11 (Fig. 3 and Table 1).32 A sky blue emitting Ir(dbi)3 complex was picked as a guest and high power and current efficiencies of 43.0 lm W−1 and 41.6 cd A−1 were obtained with a multilayer configuration. Instead of carbazole, triarylamine was also associated with a phosphine oxide through a non-conjugated cyclohexyl spacer, 12 (Fig. 3 and Table 1).33 This design allows for both bipolar transport and a high T1 level and was therefore used as a host for blue phosphorescent complex FIr6. In combination with a phosphine oxide based ETL, an efficiency of over 20% was achieved.

Phosphine oxide substituted by spirobifluorene showed only electron transport ability and therefore exhibited significant roll-off (i.e. decrease of efficiency with increasing current density). High performances could however be achieved with some of these derivatives.2,7 Phosphine oxide substituted spirobifluorene (2, Fig. 2 and Table 1) was used as a host for FIrpic and an EQE of 20.3% was achieved and 19% was obtained without a LiF injecting layer.34 In order to efficiently transfer energy from a host to a red triplet emitter, the ET of the host should be lower than those used with blue emitters. The spirobifluorene core of 2 was thus modified to 5 (Fig. 2) resulting in an ET of 2.32 eV against 2.83 eV for 2.35 The device with Ir(pq)2acac as the emitter and 5 as the host displayed a maximum EQE of 20%. In 2015, Poriel et al. combined the diphenylphosphinospirobifluorene structure with the carbazole moiety to benefit the balanced charge transport given by both fragments (9, Fig. 3).36 This platform allowed the authors to prepare one of the most efficient single layer green PhOLEDs to date (EQE = 13.2% with Ir(ppy)3 as an emitter).
The silyl group has also attracted attention due to the bulkiness and the non-conjugating properties of the phenylsilyl derivatives. Linked to carbazole and phosphine oxide, the tetraphenylsilyl derivative host (10, Fig. 3 and Table 1) showed balanced charged transport and high ET for energy transfer to a deep blue phosphorescent dopant and an EQE of 22% was achieved.37 In 2013, Tao et al. proposed a new approach to develop an ambipolar host involving the N–PO pattern where carbazole or arylamine is bonded to phosphine oxide (13, Fig. 3 and Table 1).38 This ambipolar behavior will improve charge transport and charge injection. This ability was illustrated in devices using FIrpic as an emitter. EQE as high as 16.5% was obtained using 13 as a host with a relatively low driving voltage showing the ability of the N–PO pattern.
2.3. As emitting materials
The phosphine oxide pattern was also inserted into the backbone of oligomers. This allowed the development of deep blue emitters due to the disruption of the conjugation. Solution processability was maintained and the pyramidal geometry prevents solid-state aggregation. This geometric parameter is an intrinsic advantage of P-derivatives for all applications linked with solid-state emission (see also 4.2).
Liu et al. synthesized different linear oligomers made of a phosphine oxide central core, oligo-phenylene/fluorene chains and an N-phenylnaphthalen-1-amine end cap (P2, Fig. 4).39 These structures allowed the authors to obtain balanced charge transport and deep blue emission. An EQE of up to 2.06% was achieved with P2 with very low efficiency roll-off. The same group later developed two-dimensional oligo-fluorenes P3 with a central phosphine oxide (Fig. 4).40 Oligomers were inserted into a device with the following structure: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/EML/TPBI/CsF/Al. An EQE of up to 3.41% was achieved with fluorine based oligomers P3-3 (Fig. 4) with deep blue emission. It turns out that 2D oligomers work better than their 1D analogs. Following their work on polymeric hosts31 Wang et al. grafted the phosphorescent complex (FIrPic) as a side chain of the polymer backbone of P4.41 The latter consists of a fluorinated and non-fluorinated phosphine oxide with carbazole units (P4, Fig. 4). An EQE of up to 9% was achieved along with 19.0 cd A−1 luminous efficiency. In a further study, Shao et al. introduced an additional yellow phosphorescent emitter into the side chains in order to obtain a white OLED (Fig. 4).42 This approach is possible since the polymer backbone possesses a high triplet energy making energy transfer from the backbone to the blue triplet emitter effective. The performances obtained are among the best for a single polymer white OLED. Another approach to obtain a white emission is to generate an exciplex.43 In Qiu's work, a novel electro-deficient compound based on an anthracene diphenylphosphine oxide 15 (Fig. 4) forms an exciplex at the interface with NPB where excitons recombine. This phenomenon was also observable in a blend of 15 and NPB. As a result, pure white emission (CIE: x, 0.33; y, 0.33) was obtained with a simple bilayer structure (ITO/NPB/15/Mg:Ag/Ag).21 Kim et al. developed an exciplex with a high triplet energy level by mixing a phosphine oxide based ETL, 14 (Fig. 4), and mCP as a HTL. The exciplexes are formed efficiently in the host and the energy transfer from the exciplex to the blue phosphorescent dopant (FIrpic) is very efficient, enabling the triplet harvest without energy loss. As a result, blue PhOLEDs with high performance have been fabricated. The EQE reaches 30.3% with a maximal power efficiency of 66 lm W−1.44

Finally one example of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) was reported by Adachi et al. in the exciplex state of a complex where 16 (Fig. 4) is used as the electron accepting material.45 An EQE of 10% was obtained. Considering the several perspectives opened by this new phenomenon for fluorescent OLEDs, molecular design of novel phosphine based TADF emitters could be a future area of development for the phosphine based molecular materials.46
3. Phosphazenes
Phosphazenes are organic compounds where P and N atoms are linked through a double bond. There is no evidence of conjugation in phosphazenes because these materials are ylides with a highly polarized bond. Phosphazenes have been well studied in both linear and cyclic forms due to their various properties including excellent hydrolytic stability, flame retardant properties, thermal stability and liquid crystalline behavior among others. The phosphazenes have been inserted in DSSCs and OLEDs. Cyclic phosphazenes are used as platforms for the synthesis of star-shaped species for OLED applications taking advantage of their low glass transition (Tg) and high stability. Cyclic phosphazene cores possess some appealing advantages for organic electronics: they are easily functionalized and highly stable even under hard conditions. The phosphazene core is “electronically” inert: the electronic and optical properties only come from the lateral π-conjugated system. The resulting compounds exhibit spherical shapes, which lead to an amorphous solid phase, which is an important property for OLED applications.
3.1. As electrolytes for DSSCs
Polyphosphazenes first caught the attention for lithium-ion battery applications47 due to their ability to conduct lithium efficiently and have high thermal stability. They were then used as electrolytes for quasi-solid state or solid-state DSSCs. In 2009, Xiang et al. reported an electrolyte based on two polymers: polyphosphazene with propionitrile and iodo-ethylene oxide-co-propylene oxide side chains (Fig. 5), and oligo-organosiloxane grafted oligo-ethylene oxide and propylene oxide dimethylamine side chains.48 The low Tg of both polymers enables deep penetration into the pores of the TiO2 nanoparticles. The cross-linking precursors on the side chains undergo a quaternization reaction upon thermal treatment making the electrolyte insoluble. Photoconversion efficiency with this electrolyte reached 2.66% upon doping with 20 wt% modified silica nanoparticles. In the early 2010s, the group of Allcock et al. studied pore penetration49 and the influence of an iodide salt50 on linear and cyclic phosphazene based non-volatile electrolytes. They showed that much like other polymers, polyphosphazenes face pore penetration issues that could partly be overcome by heat-fluidization and solvent assistance. As a result, the use of smaller oligomers or cyclic phosphazene is preferable to facilitate infiltration. Performances obtained with this electrolyte remain low; their structure was probably not fully adapted to ionic transport in DSSCs as they were initially designed for lithium-ion batteries. Nevertheless, molecular engineering of the side arm could lead to better results.

3.2. As emitters
Bolink et al. functionalized the phosphazene core with fluorescent (17–20, Fig. 5) or phosphorescent moieties (21, Fig. 5).51 The compounds exhibited high temperature of decomposition (Td) and high Tg without any melting temperature (Tm) confirming the amorphous nature. They showed blue-green emission in solution and in film. Single layer OLEDs (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/17(18–20)/Ba:Ag) led to low performances (Table 2) but showed that the fluorescent derivatives only had hole transport character due to the high numbers of triarylamine groups. In order to overcome such unbalanced charge transport, an ETL (TPBI) was used to give the following device configuration: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/17(18–20)/TPBI/Ba:Ag. Emission ranging from blue for compounds 17 and 18, to green for larger compounds 19 and 20 was observed. Best performances (Table 2) were achieved with cyclic phosphazene (CP) 17, reaching 11000 cd m−2 at 12 V and an EQE of 0.72% at 8 V. In the case of phosphorescent derivative 21, a matrix of poly(9-vinylcarbazol) (PVK) and 2-(4-biphenylyl)-5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole (PBD) was employed to dilute the compound. The diode with the following structure: ITO/PEDOT/PSS/PVK:PBD:21/TPBI/B/Si had an EQE of 7%. L. Bauge et al. have developed several series of phosphorus-containing dendrimers decorated with fluorescent end groups (naphthalene, anthracene and pyrene). In thin films, the pyrene based dendrimers exhibit a very broad emission characteristic of excimers. An OLED including an emitting layer based on a 4th generation dendrimer including 48 pyrenes units, 24-G4 (Fig. 5 and Table 2) in a PVK matrix has been fabricated. The electroluminescence spectrum presents the characteristic emission of the pyrene excimers but the emission of light is low (3.5 cd m−2) and the threshold voltage is high (over 20 V).52

3.3. As host matrices for triplet emitters
As observed with phosphine oxides, the absence of conjugation, the resultant high HOMO–LUMO gap and high glass transition temperature make CPs interesting hosts for phosphorescent derivatives. In that context, two different teams designed solution processed and vacuum processed CPs.53,54 Soh et al. developed CP derivative 22 based on carbazole. No melting or crystallization points were observed showing that these materials are highly amorphous. The triplet energy band gap of the two CPs was estimated to be 3.0 eV, which is higher than the triplet level of the blue emitters (FIrpic) (2.62 eV). The following OLED structure was employed to evaluate the host abilities of the CPs: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/poly-TPD/22:emitter/BCP/BCP:Cs2CO3/Al. A green emitter (Ir(mppy)3) and FIrpic were used in this case. Devices showed high luminance and power efficiency (Table 3) double the reference device using PVK as a host. Recently Schrögel et al. prepared a vacuum processable CP 23 host for a deep blue triplet emitter. Thermal analysis showed that the CPs had high Td and moderate Tg. Furthermore, morphologically stable amorphous films could be obtained from both solution and vacuum processes. A single carrier device made from 23 showed that it had balanced charge transport properties. The triplet energy level of the CP was calculated to be −3.2 eV and therefore 23 was used as a host for a deep blue triplet emitter (Ir(dbfmi)) in an OLED with the following structure: ITO/MoO3:NPD/DPBIC/DPBIC:Ir(dbfmi)/23:Ir(dbfmi)/DBFSi/TPBi/LiF/Al. The maximum power efficiency of 7.6 lm W−1 is achieved at 5.5 V and the maximum luminance of 5000 cd m−2 is achieved at 13.4 V (Table 3). These values are significantly lower than those obtained with other hosts55 but this remains proof of the flexibility of CPs which can be either processed by solution or vacuum.

4. Phospholes
Phospholes are a particular class of phosphines in which the P-atom is incorporated in an unsaturated 5-membered heterocycle. Unlike thiophene and pyrrole, 1-phenylphosphole is only slightly aromatic as the phosphorus lone pair does not participate in the intracyclic delocalization.56 Actually its low aromaticity comes from the interaction between the exocyclic σ*(P–R) and the intracyclic dienic moiety. The lone pair of the phosphole is thus available for reactivity. In the case of σ4–λ5 phosphole oxide (PO) or thio-oxide (PS), the compounds become slightly antiaromatic.57 These unusual electronic properties allowed to access compounds with rather low HOMO–LUMO gaps. Furthermore, as already mentioned for phosphines, the pyramidal shape of the P-atom affords significant steric hindrance that prevents solid-state aggregation.
4.1. As charge transport layers
Benzophospholes (BP) 25–26 (Fig. 6) were developed by Tsuji et al. as ETLs for OLEDs.5825 and 26, which only differ by the substituent at the P-atoms (O vs. S), possess very similar physical and photophysical properties. They showed a highly stable amorphous phase due to the tetrahedral shape of the P-atom preventing the formation of microcrystalline domains. They also have an average to good electron mobility, 5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 25 and 2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 26. This difference is explained by the highly polar character of the PO bond, which traps electrons. They were therefore used as dopants in a Cs ETL which was incorporated in an OLED. The device including benzophosphole 26 showed slightly superior performances than the one based on 25 as the voltage at 1000 cd m−2 was 5.0 V and 5.9 V and luminance efficiency was 1.8 lm W−1 and 1.4 lm W−1 respectively.
 Fig. 6  Electron transport material for OLEDs and OPVs. 
Similar properties were observed with benzophosphole 27 (Fig. 6 and Table 4) which were used as a cathode buffer layer along with 25 and 26 in an OPV cell (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BP/PB:SIMEF/27/Al).59 The high glass transition observed for these compounds allows the thermal annealing process without altering the layer. This process improves the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cell from 2.5 to 4.6%. The authors claim that coordination complexes are formed at the interface with aluminum, like for phosphine oxide, resulting in lower resistance between the two layers. Inspired by this work, Matano et al. developed diarylaceneoxophospholes 28–31 (Fig. 6) exhibiting relatively high Tg and modest mobilities.60 Nevertheless their use in OPV cells as a buffer layer (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:IC70BA/28–31/Al) gave better performances (Table 4) than with BCP, a common organic n-type material. The authors report that the nature of the 2,5-substituents of the phosphole ring impacts the performances due to different packing motifs and/or different contact resistance. In this case, oxophosphole worked significantly better than its thiooxo-counterparts.

One example of the dibenzophosphole based host for triplet emitters was published in 2012 (32, Fig. 7).61 The author prepared an OLED with a Os(II) based emitter presenting an EQE of 14% which is 3% higher than the reference device containing a CBP host. This effect was attributed to the better charge carrier mobility (both for holes and electrons) of 32 compared to BCP.

4.2. As emitters in OLEDs
The insertion of phosphole derivatives as emitters in OLEDs dates back to 2003 by Fave et al. with 2,5-dithienylphosphole derivatives 33–34 (Fig. 7).62 Derivatization can be performed on the reactive P-center to obtain either thiooxophospholes or Au(I) complexes. Several other phosphole-based conjugated systems were prepared and inserted in fluorescent OLEDs.63 In these studies, the only σ3–λ3 phosphole suitable for vacuum sublimation was 35 (Fig. 7) as this species is usually not thermally stable enough to withstand this process. Green emission at 510 nm was obtained with an EQE of 0.08% in a single layer OLED (0.29% in a multilayer configuration). Thiooxophosphole derivatives 33, 36, 37 (Fig. 7) showed low performances (Table 5) in single layer OLEDs but they can be improved by using a HTL (α-NPB) and an ETL (Alq3). Quantum efficiency can be increased by four to ten times depending on the structure of the π-conjugated systems. For example, the maximum EQE of emitter 33 ranges from 0.16% to 0.80%. Interestingly, gold complexes 34 or 38 (Fig. 7 and Table 5) have very low performances in single layer diodes. Furthermore, electroluminescence differs completely from photoluminescence in solution, unlike σ3–λ3 phosphole and thiooxophosphole. This phenomenon was later rationalized by Joly et al. on fluorenylphosphole 39–43 (Fig. 7 and Table 5).64 They unambiguously showed that the lower energy emission was actually coming from fast decomposition of the gold complexes upon electric field. Some low molecular weight dibenzophospholes were inserted in OLEDs by vacuum sublimation without success as the device characteristics showed instability with increasing driving current.64 In contrast, polymers based on fluorene and benzophosphole P5/benzooxophosphole P6, (Fig. 7 and Table 5) were used as EMLs in a single layer device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/EML/Al).65P5 showed blue electroluminescence with a brightness of up to 1423 cd m−2 whereas P6 exhibited a white emission but with lower brightness (142 cd m−2).

So far, the best EQE recorded for an OLED with an EML based only on a phosphole derivative has been 1.8% with 2,5-difluorenylthiooxophosphole 41 (Fig. 7 and Table 5). In 2012, Kondo et al. reached 4.0% EQE which is close to the theoretical limit of fluorescent OLEDs, using dithienophosphole dopant 45 as an emitter in a TBADN host.66 A new type of phosphole based-emitter was developed by Chen et al. using benzofuran fused phosphole 46 (Fig. 7). The EQE in a multilayer device was only 0.45%, limited by the poor transport properties of the phosphole and probable electromer formation as the electroluminescence was red shifted by 40 nm compared to neat film photoluminescence.
Phosphole emitters also appeared to be original materials in the context of white light emission, which remain a challenge for both academic and industrial purposes. To this end, orange emitting phospholes were chosen as dopants for blue emitting matrices in order to achieve white light through energy transfer. Preliminary work was done by Fadhel et al. with 2,5-dithienylphosphole 33, 34 and 47 (Fig. 7 and Table 6).67 The amount of 33 required to dope DPVBi to achieve a white emission was too low and therefore tricky to control. The authors thus used the HTL, α-NPB, as a matrix. A moderate increase of the dopant amount allowed the preparation of an OLED with a satisfactory white emission (CIE: x, 0.28; y, 0.34). The same approach was used with dopant 47. The red-shifted emission of 47 compared to 33, allowed to prepare a purer white OLED using a doping rate of 0.2% in α-NPB. Compounds 43 and 44 (Fig. 7 and Table 6) were also used as dopants for DPVBi.68 The optimum doping rate of 43 was found to be 0.3% (CIE: x, 0.27; y, 0.33) and EQE reached 2.1%. The necessary amount of dopant 44 to achieve a white emission was surprisingly higher than for all other phosphole derivatives. Furthermore, it was found that this dopant was highly quench resistant as the EQE remains stable even at a very high doping rate. This was due to a combination of favorable factors such as structural and physical properties. A dopant based on 2,2′-bisphosphole 48 was later developed by Chen et al.69 In this family of compounds, the control of the distortion angle between the two phosphole units allowed fine-tuning of the optical/electronic properties and close to perfect CIE coordinates was achieved (CIE: x, 0.34; y, 0.34) by doping a DPVBi matrix. Even if the working parameters of this device remain low, the proof of concept of using the torsion angle of biphosphole to adjust the HOMO–LUMO gap opens very interesting perspectives for various opto-electronic applications. Finally, a new family of P-containing PAHs was recently developed (compounds 49–50, Fig. 7 and Table 6).70 These compounds were the first reported polyaromatic compounds featuring a P atom in their scaffold. They show high luminescence in the orange-red region in dilute solutions and this fluorescence remains high in the solid matrix. WOLED devices were prepared using NPB as a blue matrix. At a doping rate of 0.8%, white emission was achieved (CIE: x, 0.32; y, 0.37) with an EQE of 1.2%.71 In this case again, efficiencies remain low but optimization of this new family of P-derivatives may lead to interesting improvement in the field of emitting materials.

4.3. As dyes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)
In 2010 Kira et al. developed a sensitizer for DSSCs based on 1-hydroxy-1-oxydithienophosphole derivatives 51–52 (Fig. 8), used as both acceptor moieties and anchoring groups.72 The incident-photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the DSSC with TiO2/51 and TiO2/52 were estimated to be 66% and 43%, respectively. Maximal efficiency was measured for 52 with a PCE of 1.8%. Even if the efficiencies remain low, the originality of this work is the use of the hydroxyoxophosphole moiety as a binding motif toward TiO2, as most of the studies use carboxylic acid or phosphinic acid (which are not detailed in this review).73
 Fig. 8  Dithienophosphole based dyes for DSSCs and phosphole polymer organic solar cells. 
More recently, the same team developed a new series of push–pull dyes featuring a triarylamine donor and a carboxylic acid-substituted thioxophosphole as an acceptor (53–54, Fig. 8).74 In this case, the anchoring group is not located at the P-atom. The sterically hindered P(V) center appears to be an appealing system to prevent dye aggregation. After optimization, a PCE of up to 5.6% has been obtained with better results for compound 54. These performances were attributed to a better charge collection. These two examples show that the phosphole backbone can be used as a π-conjugated linker and as an anchoring group for the development of new dyes for DSSCs.
4.4. As donors in organic photovoltaics
In 2014 the first example of a phosphole-based polymer for organic photovoltaics was published. P7 and P8 (Fig. 8) were based on benzodithiophene and either imidophosphole or oxophosphole. Modification at the P atom did not modify the optical properties. Both polymers were used as donors in blend with a PC71BM acceptor and significantly better photovoltaic performances were achieved with the oxophosphole derivatives (P8: Jsc = 2.6 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.63 V, FF = 0.40, η = 0.65%; P7: Jsc = 0.45 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.45 V, FF = 0.35, η = 0.07%). These results show that P-substituents have a clear impact on the charge-generation efficiency and/or charge-carrier pathways in the blend. These pioneering results were recently overcome by the use of P9–10 (Fig. 8).75 In this case, the P-containing repeated unit is a dithienophosphole oxide that acts as an electron deficient unit in a donor–acceptor low-band gap polymer. Bulk heterojunction devices prepared by mixing the P9–10 donors with the PC71BM acceptor allowed the authors to reach a PCE of 7.1% in the case of solar cells processed with 1,8-octanedithiol as an additive (P9: Jsc = 13.2 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.87 V, FF = 0.53, η = 6.10%; P10: Jsc = 14.8 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.85 V, FF = 0.56, η = 7.08%). The authors attribute this efficiency to the high polarizability of the oxophosphole moiety. This efficiency is close to the best efficiency achieved for all organic devices and paves the way for highly efficient P-containing polymers for photovoltaic applications.
4.5. Electrochemical cells
In 2012 Baumgartner et al. designed discotic dendritic phospholes that form luminescent gels and liquid crystalline phases.76 In particular, they showed on compound 55 (Fig. 9) that oxidation allowed the tuning of the colour and the photoluminescence of a simple electrochromic cell (ITO/55 + NBu4ClO4/ITO). This was the first example of electrochromism on P-heterocycles. This concept was recently applied to derivatives 56–57 (Fig. 9). These phosphole-viologen analogs display very low reduction potential and the electrochromic behaviour could be demonstrated with a switch from the colourless dication of 56 to its blue mono-cationic form.77 This concept was further applied to multicolour electrochromic devices using the 3 stable redox states of 57.78 These devices are not OLEDs as there is no electroluminescence, but these studies show that the amphoteric redox properties of the phosphole allows the tuning of their absorption/emission upon electrical stimuli.
 Fig. 9  Phosphole derivatives used in electrochromic devices. 
5. 4-Membered ring P-heterocycles
5.1. 1,3-Diphosphacyclobutane-2,4-diyls
Ito et al. recently reported the synthesis of air-stable P-heterocyclic biradicals, namely 1,3-diphosphacyclobutane-2,4-diyls (Fig. 1 and 10).79 These compounds were first prepared by Niecke et al.80 but it was only when Ito et al. modified the substituent at the P atom that an air stable compound could be prepared. In particular, the use of amino-substituted triazine allowed them to prepare 58 as an air-stable derivative with low oxidation potential. FET devices (Si/SiO2 wafer with interdigitated Au bottom electrodes) using drop-cast 58 were prepared. The device exhibited p-semi-conducting properties with low mobility (2.3 × 10−8 cm2 V−1 s−1) and an on/off ratio of 7. The lack of intra-molecular interactions in the solid-state is a possible reason for this low activity. These characteristics are rather low compared to benchmark organic semi-conductors. However, this first example of a P-containing OFET-active compound clearly shows that these derivatives can be interesting for this application. Considering the electron affinity of phosphine/phosphole oxide, the preparation of OFETs with n-type characteristics is clearly a perspective for all these compounds.81

5.2. Phosphete
Recently, 1,2-dihydrophosphete derivatives (Fig. 1 and 10) were also introduced as new π-conjugated systems for optoelectronic applications. This unsaturated four-membered P-heterocycle appeared to be an appealing skeleton to develop novel P-based emitters. Like in phosphine and phospholes, the pyramidal shape of the P affords steric hindrance that prevents solid-state aggregation. A whole family of fluorophores based on this skeleton (59–61, Fig. 10) was prepared by Chen et al.82 Multilayer OLEDs (ITO/CuPc/α-NPB/EML/DPVBi/BCP/Alq3/LiF) have been developed and they displayed the blue electroluminescence characteristic of the P-fluorophores. Efficiencies were higher when the compounds were doped in a matrix (CPB or DPVBi). This was attributed to moderate charge carrier mobility in the EML. In particular, devices prepared with 59 in a DPVBi matrix exhibited blue electroluminescence, good performances and current independent CIE coordinates. This preliminary study paves the way for the development of efficient devices based on this new P-scaffold.
6. Conclusions
This review presents the main class of P-containing π-conjugated compounds used in electronic devices (mainly OLEDs). By far, the most widely studied class of organophosphorus derivatives in optoelectronics are the triarylphosphines used as ETLs or hosts for triplet emitters in OLEDs. Their thermal stability, high electron affinity of the oxophosphine moiety associated and easy modification of the aryl substituents made the use of triarylphosphines very popular. The second class of compounds, which are also widely used, are the phospholes. They were mainly studied as emitters in OLEDs (including WOLEDs). The incorporation of the phosphole fragment in the π-system allows to obtain solid-state emission due to the pyramidal shape of P that prevents aggregation. Furthermore, the intrinsic low-band gap of phosphole allows us to obtain compounds with red-shifted absorption/emission compared to phosphines. In addition to these two classes of P-derivatives, phosphazenes and phosphete derivatives have also been used in OLEDs.
In the case of solar cells, (thieno)phospholes appear to be the most adapted P-backbone as it allows good light absorption due to its low HOMO–LUMO gap together with a good electron affinity and planarity that will favor charge transport in the bulk. However, the examples of their use remain limited. Nevertheless, there are no theoretical limitations for the developments of these compounds for photovoltaic applications, including their replacement of fullerenes as acceptors considering the excellent electron affinity of all phosphine oxide derivatives.
Finally, only one example of an organophosphorus derivative for OFET application has been described to the best of our knowledge. Surprisingly, it is a p-type OFET based on an unusual diradical backbone structure, while the oxidized organophosphorus derivatives are widely used for their electron affinity. Here again, no technical limitation is responsible for the absence of P-derivatives. The recent development of highly planar P-derivatives and phosphahelicenes should give rise to new solid state organization and new physical properties interesting for the preparation of n-type OFETS or 3D-OLEDs, respectively.70,83,84
However, based on a variety of different P-scaffolds described in the literature,7,85 new efficient P-derivatives for opto-electronic applications are still to be discovered.

D. Joly
	Damien Joly obtained his PhD in chemistry supervised by Prof. M. Hissler and Prof. R. Réau from Rennes University in France, in 2010. From 2011 to 2012, he was a postdoctoral fellow at IMDEA Nanoscience in Madrid in the group of Prof. N. Martin. In 2012 he joined, as a post-doctoral fellow, the laboratory of molecular, hybrid and organic electronics at CEA Grenoble to develop organic sensitizers for solar cells. Since 2015, he has been a temporary researcher in the same department. His research interests are mainly focused on the development of π-conjugated materials for organic electronics and hybrid photovoltaics.

P.-A. Bouit
	Pierre-Antoine Bouit graduated in 2005 from the Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Paris (Chimie-Paristech, France). He obtained a PhD in 2008 at the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon (ENS-Lyon, France) under the supervision of Dr O. Maury and Dr C. Andraud. Then, he joined the group of Prof. N. Martín at IMDEA Nanoscience (Madrid, Spain). Since 2011, he has been a CNRS researcher in the Phosphorus and Molecular Materials group at the Institute of Chemical Sciences of Rennes (France). His research studies focus on the synthesis of P-containing π-conjugated systems and heteroatom-containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

M. Hissler
	Muriel Hissler completed a PhD thesis at the Louis Pasteur University (Strasbourg, France) on the design and applications of luminescent molecules containing transition metals. After one year as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Rochester (USA), she joined the “Phosphorus and Molecular Materials” team at the University of Rennes 1 as an Associate Professor. In 2007, she was promoted as a Professor at the University of Rennes 1. Her research interests are mainly directed towards the synthesis of π conjugated oligomers or polymers having physical properties useful for optoelectronic applications. The originality of her approach is to use the potential of phosphorus chemistry to prepare conjugated compounds with new electronic properties.
