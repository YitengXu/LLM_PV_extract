    , Accepted 14th June 2021First published on 15th June 2021AbstractThe introduction of graphene quantum dots (GQDs) into the photoactive layer of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has achieved encouraging experimental results. However, the best linkage configuration between the sensitizer and graphene quantum dots to enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs is still unclear. Hence, three different covalent bindings (amidation reaction, cycloaddition reaction and free radical addition) were comprehensively investigated from a theoretical perspective. The theoretical investigation indicated that covalent bonding of GQD is beneficial to the optical and electrical properties, especially via the amidation reaction, greatly enhancing the absorption intensity, which further improves the utilization of light and leads to a better photocurrent response. Covalent bonding of GQD via the amidation reaction can improve the maximum photon generated current compared to other covalent behaviors, exhibiting better intermolecular charge transfer character. Based on the analysis of the intermolecular interaction between the dye and I2, covalent bonding of GQD via the amidation reaction can decrease the electron recombination rate. Therefore, covalent bonding of GQD via the amidation reaction is regarded as the most promising approach to enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs. In addition, various graphene oxide and doped graphene QDs were also studied to provide possibilities for improving the efficiency of DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Over the past few decades, fossil fuels have been regarded as the primary energy source to promote social development. However, with the increasing demands of industries, the traditional fossil resources are being depleted, causing severe environmental issues. Hence, the development of renewable and clean energy technologies is a promising strategy to overcome this problem.1,2 Solar energy as an almost limitless, abundant and pollution-free resource has received considerable interest worldwide, especially for photovoltaic devices, which directly convert solar energy to electricity.3,4 However, the high cost of materials and complex fabrication processes are the main factors limiting their large-scale applications. Among various emerging technologies, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are considered the most promising photovoltaic equipment due to their low cost, easy assembly, environment-friendly features and relatively high power conversion efficiency.5 A typical DSSC is composed of four components, i.e., sensitizer, TiO2 photoanode, electrolyte and counter electrode.6,7 The sensitizer is a crucial component in a DSSC, which is responsible for the capture of photons and injection of electron. The metal sensitizers (such as Zn-porphyrins and Ru-complexes) have achieved high efficiency,8,9 but their development is still limited by their scarcity and tedious purification. In contrast, metal-free organic dyes are fascinating due to their flexible molecular design, abundant raw materials and easily tunable optical properties.10,11 Thus, to further improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs, continued efforts have been devoted to searching for novel sensitizers.12–17 Currently, the highest efficiency achieved by a metal-free organic dye-based DSSC is 14.3% using a cobalt complex as the electrolyte.18
The D-π-A framework is the most typical structure for metal-free organic dyes in DSSCs, which is beneficial for the charge separation and transfer upon photo excitation. However, organic dyes with the D-π-A configuration usually possess a single and narrow absorption band in the UV-visible region. Accordingly, poor light harvesting ability is the primary reason why the efficiencies of DSSCs based on the D-π-A configuration dyes are still low. Therefore, improving the light absorption ability has become a hot topic in DSSC research. To overcome the shortcomings of individual sensitizers, the co-sensitization technique, which involves mixing two or more dyes in the photoactive layer, is a promising method to improve the light harvesting efficiency.19,20 Over the past few decades, various co-sensitization systems, such as porphyrin and ruthenium complexes with organic dyes, i.e., two different organic dyes, have been proposed and improved the efficiency of DSSCs compared with the devices based on individual sensitizers.21,22 In addition, numerous efforts have also been devoted to developing new photoactive materials to enhance the photovoltaic performances of DSSCs.23–27
Graphene, as a popular sp2-hybridized material, has attracted widespread attention in recent years due to its remarkable physical and chemical properties, such as high electron mobility, easy surface modification, excellent flexibility, and extraordinary conductive properties, which has been widely researched in the fields of sensors, supercapacitors, photocatalysis, Li-ion batteries and other areas.28–32 Liu et al. reported that covalently functionalized graphene is beneficial for improving the optical absorption property, which may provide a new development in optoelectronic devices. Therefore, researchers have synthesized various nanocomposites to enhance the light absorption property of DSSCs via different chemical modification approaches.33 Kiessling et al. demonstrated the applicability of nanographene/porphyrin hybrids in DSSCs.34 Guarracino et al. synthesized a graphene-dye hybrid material as a stable photosensitizer in DSSCs via free radical addition. They observed fast quenching of the dye excited state in the isolated hybrid and efficient electron transfer to the N-doped TiO2 nanopowder.35 Mandal et al. systematically studied the feasibility of a porphyrin-sensitized graphene quantum dot solar cell through an amide linkage. They found that the hybrid nanocomposite of GQD and porphyrin may be a good candidate for application in solar cells.36 Gao et al. performed a theoretical investigation on the photoelectric properties of a tetraphenylporphyrin-GQD nanohybrid material as a sensitizer. Their results indicated that GQD-3TPPs are potential candidates for application in solar cells due to their enhanced light harvesting capability, obvious charge spatial separation and low recombination rate of electrons and holes.37 Thus, it is clear that the covalent bonding of GQD via the chemical modification approach is a promising strategy to improve the photoelectric performance of DSSCs.
The common covalent method can be classified into three categories (see Fig. 1): (i) amidation reaction (AR), (ii) cycloaddition reaction (CR) and (iii) free radical addition (FRA). However, to date, which covalent behavior is the best way to improve the efficiency of DSSCs has not been reported in the literature. Hence, the purpose of the current work was to systematically investigate the influence of different linkage types between the sensitizer and GQD on the photoelectric performance of DSSCs, and then try to find a promising approach to enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency.

2. Models and methods
In this research, the organic molecule DM with a D-π-A framework was employed as the dye model, according to Dhar's work.38 The model of cir-coronene C54H18 was selected as the pristine GQD (Fig. 2), which has been widely reported by theoretical studies.39–41 In addition, graphene oxide and doped graphene QDs are popular and have been extensively investigated in recent years.42,43 For the graphene oxide quantum dot (GOQD), three reference models were used (Fig. 2). In the first model, an additional O radical appeared on the basal plane (GO1) through a double C–O–C linkage. In the second and third models, an additional OH radical was anchored on the basal plane and the edges of the thin film sheet (GO2 and GO3, respectively). For the doped graphene quantum dot, type I was dual-doped with the same heteroatoms (e.g., N/N-doped, B/B-doped and P/P-doped, which were labeled as NNG, BBG and PPG, respectively). Type II was co-doped with different heteroatoms (e.g., N/B-doped, B/P-doped and N/P-doped, which were designated as NBG, BPG and NPG, respectively).

The ground-state geometries of the nanocomposites and isolated dye in ethanol solution were fully optimized using the density functional theory (DFT) method at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level employing the conductor-like polarized continuum model (C-PCM).44 Frontier molecular orbitals and energy levels were obtained based on the optimized configurations. This level of theory has been widely used to calculate the geometrical properties of organic molecules in related theoretical research and provides reliable results comparable to experimental data.45–47 Moreover, the anionic and cationic energies were calculated at the aforementioned level of theory to estimate the ionization potentials (IP), electron affinities (EA), chemical reactivity parameters, and hole (λh) and electron (λe) reorganization energies. The optical absorption properties for the lowest 20 singlet–singlet excitations of the nanocomposites were calculated via the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) method. To ensure the reliability of the TD-DFT calculation, several exchange correlation functionals containing B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, MPW1PW91, B3PW91 and M062X with the 6-31G(d) basis set were selected to simulate the absorption spectra of DM and the results are presented in Table S1 (ESI†). The maximum absorption wavelength and absorption shape showed that the CAM-B3LYP functional is in good agreement with the experimental value with a deviation of 6 nm. Therefore, the optical properties of nanocomposites were calculated using the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) level, which is consistent with previous research.48–50 In addition, the analysis of the intramolecular charge transfer parameters and electron density difference maps (EDDs) was performed using the Multiwfn software.51 All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package.52
3. Results and discussion
Graphene quantum dots
The nanocomposites of GQD with DM were constructed via the amidation reaction, cycloaddition reaction and free radical addition, which were termed G-AR, G-CR and G-FRA, respectively. The optimized ground state structures of the nanocomposites and DM are illustrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†). It is well known that the degree of geometric distortion plays an important role in the charge separation and the coplanar configuration facilitates electron transfer. The critical positions of the dye molecule are marked in Scheme 1 and the corresponding values are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). It is clear that the covalent GQD has negligible effects on the bond lengths and dihedral angles, which will not change the molecular configuration. The Φ5 values of all the nanocomposites are close to −180°, which is beneficial for electron transfer from the acceptor to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2. According to the working principle of DSSCs, the dye should possess an appropriate energy level to ensure dye regeneration and electron injection. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the LUMO levels of all the nanocomposites lie above the conduction band edge of TiO2,53 which guarantee sufficient driving force for electron injection from the excited state dye into TiO2. In contrast, the HOMO levels are more negative than the redox potential of I−/I3−,54 indicating that the excited dyes can be regenerated effectively by getting an electron from the electrolyte. According to Fig. 3(a), covalent bonding of GQD via different covalent methods has negligible effects on the LUMO energy. It is worth noting that the HOMO energy can be regulated by the covalent bonding of GQD, which is up-shifted by 0.23 eV (G-AR), 0.51 eV (G-CR) and 0.48 eV (G-FRA) compared to the isolated dye (DM) (see Table S3, ESI†). It is evident that the HOMO−2 and LUMO+2 energy levels are closer to that of the HOMO and LUMO after covalent bonding of GQD, which may favor an easier electron transition from HOMO−2/HOMO to LUMO/LUMO+2, respectively. Generally, a smaller energy gap means that less energy is needed for electron excitation from the ground state to excited state, thereby harvesting more sunlight. The energy gaps follow the order of DM (2.37 eV) > G-AR (2.13 eV) > G-FRA (1.89 eV) > G-CR (1.86 eV), indicating that the covalent bonding of GQD is beneficial to promote electron excitation, and subsequently improve the light absorption property.

In general, significant intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) can induce effective electron–hole separation, which is beneficial for interfacial electron injection, achieving a high photocurrent conversion efficiency. The electronic density difference (Δρ) was used to investigate the ICT characteristic, as shown in Fig. 4, where the green and pink regions denote the electron density depletion and increment, respectively. A decrease in electron density occurs in the electron-rich regions, whereas an increase in electron density occurs in the electron-poor regions. With the aim of visualizing the ICT process more insightfully, the centroids of charge associated with the positive and negative electron density zones were calculated. Apparently, all the nanocomposites show ideal charge transfer character from left-to-right, which consistent with the discussion above. The ICT properties can be quantified using the index of the spatial extent method. The spatial indices such as the charge transfer distance (DCT), H and t are presented in Fig. 4. DCT represents the distance difference between the barycenter density distribution of the positive and negative parts upon photo-excitation. H represents half of the sum of the centroid axis along the electron transfer direction. The t index is related to t = DCT − H, which estimates the through-space character with CT excitation. It is clear that the covalent bonding of GQD is beneficial to increase the transfer distance. G-AR exhibits the largest DCT among the nanocomposites, indicating that the amidation reaction between GQD and the sensitizer can enhance the ICT properties. The H values follow the order of G-FRA > G-CR > DM > G-AR. This suggests that the covalent bonding of GQD via the cycloaddition reaction and free radical addition will increase the distance of the centroid axis along the charge transfer direction. A larger t indicates smaller orbital overlap between the electron-donating and electron-accepting regions. The estimated values of t imply that the covalent bonding of GQD via the amidation reaction can effectively facilitate charge separation in the ICT process, leading to favorable interfacial electron injection. In summary, the covalent bonding of GQD via the amidation reaction can enhance the ICT properties.

Generally, electron and hole transport ability have an important impact on the performance of DSSC devices. The electron (λe) and hole (λh) reorganization energy can be approximately described as follows: λe = (E0− − E−) + (E−0 − E0)(1) λh = (E0+ − E+) + (E+0 − E0)(2)where E±0 is the energy of the anion (cation) based on the optimized geometries of the neutral molecule, E± is the energy of the anion (cation) calculated based on the optimized geometries of the anion (cation), E0± is the energy of the neutral molecule calculated at the optimized cationic (anionic) state and E0 is the energy of the neutral molecule in its ground state. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the λh of the nanocomposites are smaller than λe, revealing that these nanocomposites have a good hole transport performance. DM and the nanocomposites exhibit similar λe. However, there is a significant drop in the λh of the nanocomposites, especially for G-AR. This indicates that the covalent bonding of GQD can enhance the hole transfer efficiency. Moreover, the electron affinity (EA) and ionization potential (IP) were calculated to describe the energy barrier for hole and electron injection.55 As shown in Fig. 5, covalent bonding of GQD has no effect on the EA value. G-CR exhibits the lowest IP value, followed by G-FRA, G-AR and DM, respectively, meaning that these nanocomposites would show the better hole injection capacity.

Nonlinear optical (NLO) properties, such as isotropic polarizability (α) and total hyperpolarizability (βtot), are important for understanding the behavior of organic photovoltaic devices, which are determined via the delocalization of intramolecular charge. Hence, the NLO parameters can give the tendency of the electron charge transfer efficiency. Patil et al. found that the NLO properties of sensitizers are directly related to the efficiency of DSSCs.56 Thus, systematically investigating the NLO properties is beneficial to understand the relationship between the electronic structure and photovoltaic performance. The α and βtot of DM and the nanocomposites were calculated, which can be expressed as: (3) (4)
As shown in Table 1, the highest α was observed for G-AR, followed by G-CR, G-FRA and DM, respectively. Similar trends can be observed for βtot in Table 2, implying that the covalent bonding of GQD is beneficial to enhance the NLO response and electron charge transfer. Therefore, these nanocomposites will exhibit a higher PCE compared to MD. Among the individual components of βtot, βxxx exhibits the maximum values for DM and the nanocomposites, which suggests that the electrons will undergo a unidirectional transfer process.

DSSCs as light-to-electricity devices require a large photocurrent response in the visible-near-IR range. Hence, the absorption spectrum of the dye should overlap with the solar spectrum as much as possible to enhance the harvesting of sunlight. The simulated absorption spectra are depicted in Fig. 6 and the main characteristics upon photo-excitation are summarized in Table 3. As seen in Fig. 6(a), the nanocomposites exhibit an intense and broad spectral response in the visible region compared to DM, which is beneficial to enhance the efficiency of DSSCs. It is worth noting that the molar absorption coefficient (ε) increases greatly around the region of 300–450 nm after the covalent bonding of GQD, indicating that the covalent bonding of GQD can effectively facilitate the harvesting of solar radiation at a lower wavelength of sunlight and further improve the utilization of light. Especially G-AR exhibits more intense and broad absorption, implying that the amidation reaction is the best way to enhance the light absorption property. In addition, the oscillator strength is an important parameter related to the light harvesting efficiency. According to Table 3, it can be seen that the oscillator strength increases after the covalent bonding of GQD. Based on the results of the absorption spectra, the important frontier molecular orbitals are plotted in Fig. 7, which may be involved in the electronic excitation process. The LUMOs for DM and the nanocomposites are localized in the π-spacer and acceptor moiety. The HOMOs for DM and HOMO−2 for the nanocomposites show similar FMO spatial distributions, which are mainly distributed on the donor and 3,6-diphenyl-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c] pyrrole-1,4-dione units. This distributive character can generate effective spatial separation for intra-molecular charge transfer upon light excitation. The fluorescence properties of DM and the nanocomposites were calculated and listed in Table S4 (ESI†), and the simulated fluorescence spectra are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The fluorescence peaks of DM, G-AR, G-CR and G-FRA are 598, 500, 597 and 587 nm, respectively, which are significantly red-shifted compared to their absorption peak. It is worth noting that G-AR, G-CR and G-FRA exhibit a lower fluorescence intensity compared to DM, especially for G-AR.

To enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs, the dye should absorb energy from sunlight as much as possible. ηLHE(λ) represents the capability to harvest light at a given wavelength, which can be calculated as:57,58 ηLHE(λ) = 1 − 10−Γσ(λ)(5)where Γ is the surface loading of dye (mol cm−2) adsorbed on the semiconductor, which is calculated by the molecular size and σ(λ) is the molecular absorption cross-section (cm2 mol−1), which can be obtained from the molar absorption coefficient ε(λ) by multiplication with 1000.59,60 However, the photon number will change at different wavelengths, and thus for greater precision, the average light harvesting efficiency, , was calculated, which can be expressed as follows (6)
As shown in Fig. 8(a), G-AR exhibits the largest ηLHE(λ) due to its highest molar absorption coefficient, followed by G-CR, G-FA and DM, respectively. For , the nanocomposites exhibit larger values than that of DM. This result reveals that the covalent bonding of GQD can enhance the utilization of light, further injecting more electrons into the semiconductor. Hence, the nanocomposites will exhibit a superior photocurrent response.

Electron injection (Φinj) and collection (ηcoll) efficiency are important characteristics determining the performance of DSSC devices, which can be defined using the following expressions: (7) (8)where τrelax represents the relaxation lifetime for the excited state of the dye in solution, which is assumed to be 10 ps according to experimental measurements.61τtrans is the transport time for electrons in the TiO2 film toward the electrode. τinj and τrec denote the electron injection lifetime from the excited dye toward TiO2 and the electron recombination lifetime, respectively, which are equal to the inverse of electron injection rate (kinj) and electron recombination rate (krec) obtained from the Marcus theory.62,63 (9)where A is a constant (0.025), ħ is the reduced Planck constant, kB is the Boltzmann constant, λ is the reorganization energy, T denotes the temperature, β is the attenuation factor (0.5 Å−1), and ΔG0 is the energy difference between the donor moiety of the dye and TiO2. As shown in Table 4, it seems that Φinj and ηcoll of the nanocomposites exhibit similar values to that of DM, i.e., close to 1. In addition, the lower krec of G-AR compared with DM indicates that the covalent bonding of GQD via the amidation reaction can reduce the electron loss.

SC is an important parameter affecting the overall efficiency of DSSCs, which is closely related to the integral photon flux density, Φ(λ), in the whole absorption region. The exact part of Φ(λ) generated by dyes per second per unit area at the given wavelength (λ) can be obtained as follows: (10)
For more details, please refer to these publications.57,64 The maximal photon generated current (Jph) can be described by the following equation: (11)
As shown in Fig. 8(b), the values of Jph follow the order of G-AR > G-CR > G-FRA > DM. It is clear that the covalent bonding of GQD has a positive influence on the performance of the DSSC due to the larger Jph. Especially for G-AR, which exhibits the largest value among the nanocomposites. The flow of electric charge across a surface per second per unit area in the whole spectrum equals the short circuit density (Jmaxsc). Therefore, we can infer that the covalent bonding of GQD via the amidation reaction is the best way to enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs.
After photoinduced excitation, electron injection phenomenon will occur from the excited dye to the semiconductor. This process is associated with the electron injection rate, which can be quantified by the driving force of electron injection (ΔGinj): ΔGinj = Edye* − ECB(12)where Edye* is the excited state oxidation potential of the dye, which can be computed by subtracting the vertical excitation energy (E0) from the redox potential of the dye in the ground state (Edye), and ECB is the reduction potential of the conduction band energy of the semiconductor. A negative ΔGinj value means that a dye has sufficient driving force to ensure the smooth injection of electrons into TiO2. As shown in Fig. 9, the nanocomposites have a more negative ΔGinj compared to DM, implying that the covalent bonding of GQD will increase the driving force. After electron injection process, the oxidized dye needs to get electrons from the electrolyte to regenerate. This interfacial process is important for the continuous operation of DSSCs. To achieve efficient regeneration, sufficient driving force of regeneration (ΔGreg) is required, which can be expressed as: ΔGreg = Edye − Eredox, where Eredox represents the redox potential of the electrolyte. The ΔGreg of nanocomposites is in the range of 0.25–0.53 eV, which is smaller than that of DM (0.76 eV), indicating that the covalent bonding of GQD can enhance the regeneration efficiency. Therefore, the covalent bonding of GQD is a promising way to improve the photovoltaic performance of DSSC.

The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) is usually used to predict nucleophilic and electrophilic attack in a chemical reaction. The values of the electrostatic potential on the surface increase in the order of red < orange < yellow < green < blue. The color code of the MEP maps ranges from −0.05 a.u. (deepest red) to 0.05 a.u. (deepest blue). The red and blue zones describe the reactive region for electrophilic and nucleophilic attack, respectively. As shown in Fig. 10(a), the negative charges are associated with the nitrogen atom of the cyano group and oxygen atom of the 3,6-diphenyl-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione group. Previous studies have proposed that there electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged atoms and iodine electrolyte.65,66 Therefore, those interaction sites can be used to analyze the charge recombination between the dye and electrolyte. As is known, the collected electrons in the TiO2 conduction band can recombine with the electrolyte, which is the main cause of electronic losses. This process has a negative effect on DSSCs. The high concentration of electrolyte around the TiO2 surface will reduce the electron lifetime in the semiconductor and accelerate the charge recombination. The binding site of I2 should be far away from the TiO2 surface to minimize the electron recombination rate. According to the analysis of MEP, higher charge recombination will occur around the nitrogen atom of the cyano group. Hence, this binding site was considered to analyze the reorganization process. As shown in Fig. 10(b), they exhibit similar binding energies. It is remarkable that the oxygen atom of the amide linkage between DM and GQD show a negative charge. This position will attract some electrolyte, which can decrease the iodine concentration around the acceptor part. Therefore, the covalent bonding of GQD via the amidation reaction can suppress charge recombination, which possibly increases the open circuit photovoltage.

Doped graphene quantum dots
Doping is promising approach to regulate the photoelectric performance of the object materials. Thus, to study how doped GQD affects the electron transport mechanisms, six doping models are considered here, and the front and side view of pristine and doped GQO are illustrated in Fig. S3 (ESI†). When the C atom was replaced by a B and N atom, the average bond length of B–C and N–C is 1.50 and 1.41 Å, respectively, which is similar to C–C bond length of 1.42 Å. P atom doping results in an increase in the bond length of P–C to approximately 1.75 Å and deformation of the six-membered ring near the doping site. It can be seen from the side view that the P atom protrudes from the graphene plane to release this stress. Based on the analysis in the previous section, the amidation reaction may be the best method to enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs. Therefore, all the nanocomposites were constructed via the amidation reaction. For the type I nanocomposites, it is obvious from Fig. 3(b) that the dual-doping of B atoms can significantly cause the LUMO energy to decrease, while the dual-doping of N or P atoms can increase the HOMO energy. Among the type II nanocomposites, NPG-AR exhibits the highest HOMO energy. Therefore, it can be deduced that N or/and P-doped GQO can lead to an increase in the HOMO energy. It is obvious from Fig. 6(b) that the molar absorption coefficient (ε) decreases after covalent bonding of doped GQDs. It is worth noting that type II nanocomposites exhibit a larger molar absorption coefficient (ε) than that of type I nanocomposites, indicating that the co-doping of two different atoms is more beneficial to improving the light-absorption properties. Compared to G-AR, the curves of BBG-AR, NNG-AR and NBG-AR are broadened in the range of 450–650 nm, implying that N- or/and B-doped GQD can enhance the light harvesting abilities at a higher wavelength of sunlight. As shown in Table S5 (ESI†), BBG-AR, PPG-AR and NPG-AR exhibit a smaller oscillator strength than that of G-AR. The HOMO−12 for BBG-AR is mainly located on the B/B-doped GQD with a little contribution from the donor part, whereas the LUMO is mainly distributed on B/B-doped GQD (see Fig. S4, ESI†). This distributive character cannot generate an efficient charge-separated state. Compared with G-AR, NBG-AR and BPG-AR exhibit similar electron distribution shapes. In contrast, for PPG-AR and NPG-AR, the HOMO-3 is primarily localized on the doped GQD, and the LUMO is mainly localized on the π-spacer and acceptor moiety. They exhibit better charge-separated states than that of G-AR. Among the nanocomposites with doped GQDs, NBG-AR and BPG-AR exhibit more negative ΔGinj and smaller ΔGreg than that of G-AR. As shown in Fig. 8(a), the nanocomposites with doped GQD exhibit higher  than that of pure GQD due to their broad spectral response. However, the molar absorption coefficient decreases after covalent bonding of doped GQDs, which leads to a decrease in ηLHE(λstrong). It can be seen from Fig. S5 (ESI†) that NBG-AR and BPG-AR exhibit a lower binding energy than that of G-AR, which means that the covalent bonding of N/B and B/P co-doped GQD can reduce the electron recombination rate. In addition, the B and P atoms of doped GQD show a negative charge (see Fig. S6, ESI†), which can attract some electrolyte far away from the acceptor part. Therefore, B or P atom-doped GQD is beneficial to suppress charge recombination, thus improving the efficiency of DSSCs.
Graphene oxide quantum dots
GO is decorated by oxygenated functional groups (O or OH) on sp2 and sp3-hybridized carbon. Furthermore, hybridized GO materials show better nonlinear optical properties.67 Herein, the nanocomposites composed of GOQD with DM via amidation reaction are labeled as GO1-AR, GO2-AR and GO3-AR. As shown in Fig. 3(c), there is no change in the LUMO energy of the nanocomposites. The HOMO energy of GO1-AR, GO2-AR and GO3-AR are slightly up-shifted compared to that of G-AR. The energy gaps follow the order of G-AR > GO3-AR > GO1-AR > GO2-AR, implying that the covalent bonding of doped GOQD will reduce the energy gap, which is beneficial for the excitation process. It can be seen from Fig. 6(c) that GO3-AR and G-AR have similar absorption curve shapes. This indicates that the presence of additional OH radicals on the edges of the thin film sheet has no effect on the spectrum. For GO1-AR and GO2-AR, they exhibit smaller molar absorption coefficients than that of G-AR. It can be noted that the presence of additional OH and O radicals on the basal plane can further facilitate the absorbance of the unused lower wavelength of sunlight than that of GQD. The oscillator strengths corresponding to the lowest-lying excitation energy are about 1.4838, 1.4850 and 1.4949 for GO1-AR, GO2-AR and GO3-AR, respectively, exhibiting a decrease compared to that of G-AR. G-AR and GO3-AR exhibit similar FMO spatial distributions (see Fig. S4, ESI†), the electron densities of HOMO−2 are mainly distributed on the donor and 3,6-diphenyl-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione units, and the LUMO is localized on the π-spacer and acceptor moiety. It can be found that the presence of additional OH radicals on the edges of the thin film sheet has no effect on the FMO. For GO1-AR and GO2-AR, the electron densities of HOMO−2 are mainly distributed on GO and LUMO is localized on the π-spacer and acceptor moiety, implying that the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups on the basal plane is beneficial to facilitate spatial separation. It can be seen from ΔGinj and ΔGreg that the covalent bonding of GOQD is beneficial for electron injection and dye regeneration, which will enhance the efficiency of DSSCs. In addition, GO1-AR and GO2-AR exhibit larger  than that of G-AR, implying that the presence of additional O and OH radicals on the basal plane can improve the utilization of light. According to Fig. S6 (ESI†), the presence of O and OH radical on the basal plane exhibit a negative charge, which can decrease charge recombination. GO3-AR has a lower binding energy than that of G-AR. Hence, covalent bonding of GOQD is beneficial to enhance the efficiency due to the lower electron recombination rate.
4. Conclusion
In this work, the mechanism of three different covalent behaviors between the sensitizer and graphene quantum dots was comprehensively investigated via DFT and TD-DFT methods to determine which one is the best approach to enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs. The theoretical investigation showed that the nanocomposites exhibit better optical and electrical properties due to their lower energy gap, ionization potential, hole reorganization energy and sufficient driving force for regeneration and electron injection, indicating that the covalent bonding of GQD is beneficial to enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency. Covalent bonding of GQD via the amidation reaction greatly enhances the absorption intensity, especially for a lower wavelength of sunlight, which further improves the utilization of light and leads to a better photocurrent response. According to the analysis of the charge transfer parameters and frontier molecular orbitals, the covalent bonding of GQD via the amidation reaction is beneficial to promote intermolecular charge transfer. Thus, using GQD to decorate the dye DM via the amidation reaction can improve maximum photon generated current compared to other covalent behaviors. The covalent bonding of GQD via the amidation reaction can decrease the iodine concentration around the acceptor part, which will decrease the electron recombination rate. Hence, it can be concluded that the covalent bonding of GQD via the amidation reaction is the best way to enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency of DSSCs. In addition, the covalent bonding of graphene oxide and doped graphene QD can effectively suppress charge recombination.
