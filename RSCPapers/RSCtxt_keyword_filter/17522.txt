    , Accepted 25th June 2012First published on 26th June 2012AbstractA simple cell architecture that achieves enhanced light harvesting with less dye quantity while simultaneously improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of dye-sensitized solar cells is presented. Polystyrene (PS) spheres of sub-micrometer size were incorporated into the titanium dioxide paste resulting in photoanodes with bimodal pore size distribution. Scanning electron micrographs of TiO2 films revealed a mixture of mesoporous and macroporous morphology in which sub-micrometer cavities created by the combustion of PS increased the light scattering, enhancing the optical path length and hence the harvesting of photons by the sensitizer. The amount of dye uptake by these films is lower than that of standard films because the high porosity reduces the total surface area. Even with lower dye adsorption, the photovoltaic performance has been maintained and even improved, mainly due to better open circuit voltage and higher fill factor. Overall, better light harvesting has helped to maintain the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells while saving up to 30% of dye loading and replacing the conventional 400 nm scattering layer with voids. By employing these photoanodes, an efficiency of 6.9% was achieved in ionic liquid based dye sensitized solar cells.
1. Introduction
Over the past two decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have widely been recognized as a promising candidate for the next generation of photovoltaic devices.1–4 A significant improvement in the titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticle photoanode was the introduction of a scattering layer consisting of large titania particles to enhance light harvesting.5 The light scattering and optical management effects are key factors in the development of DSC photoanodes and their overall performance.6,7 In general, large TiO2 particles between 100 and 400 nm are used as light scattering centres, either embedded in a matrix of smaller nanoparticles or more commonly screen-printed on top of a transparent mesoporous film.8,9 The double layer structure has become commonly used for most studies on dye-sensitized solar cells,5 including the best cell to date recording 12.3% power conversion efficiency.10 Besides the double layer structure, multilayer structures with a variation of particle sizes have also been investigated.8,9 Recently, Caruso et al.11 have successfully synthesized 500 nm titania beads with a mesoporous surface, not only achieving light scattering but also providing a large surface area for dye-loading. With these approaches, it has been shown that scattered photons are contained within the film by multiple reflections and their optical path length is increased substantially beyond the film thickness.
While the light scattering effect from large particles has been thoroughly studied and simulated, achieving similar benefits with larger pores has been little explored.12 In this study, we developed and further analysed a simple yet effective method that not only reduces the materials cost but also maintains and improves the performance of DSCs by enhanced light harvesting. The light harvesting efficiency is improved by creating sub-micrometer cavities as light scattering centres in the titanium dioxide film. We used polystyrene (PS) spheres as a template to mix with the TiO2 particle paste. After sintering, these polymer beads were burnt off, leaving behind large cavities. Furthermore, these sub-micrometer pores also increase the film's porosity, resulting in an enhancement of the photovoltaic performance by improving the mass transport of the iodide/triiodide redox electrolyte especially for a viscous ionic liquid. In addition, this approach leads to a reduction of the amount of dye used in the device by up to 30%, saving the cost of one of the most expensive components in the fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials

2.1.1. Synthesis of polystyrene spheres. 
Polystyrene spheres of the desired size were synthesized by the polymerization emulsion method as reported by J. Zhang et al.13
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich of ACS reagent or ReagentPlus grade. Prior to polymerization, styrene monomer (≥99%) was rinsed with alternating 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution and de-ionized water in a separatory funnel three times to further purify and extract any anti-polymerizing contaminants. The reaction was carried out in a five-neck flask, placed in a heating mantle, and refluxed under a N2 atmosphere. 50 g of emulsifier sodium dodecyl sulfate SDS (≥99%) in 80 ml water was first added and stirred for 30 minutes at 70 °C, followed by the addition of 320 g of initiator potassium persulfate KPS (99 + %) in 50 ml water. 190 ml de-ionized water was added slowly to the system. After that, 40 ml treated styrene was added with rapid stirring for 7 hours. The obtained product was a stable suspension and could be stored at room temperature.
For mixing with titanium dioxide paste, PS spheres in this suspension were separated from the solvent by centrifuging at 10000 rpm for 90 minutes, followed by rinsing with ethanol, redispersion and additional centrifugation. The collected powder was dried in air overnight.


2.1.2. Preparation of mixed PS–TiO2 paste. 
Commercially available paste from Dyesol (D18NR-T) was used as the original and control paste, into which different concentrations of polystyrene spheres would be added. D18NR-T contained approximately 20.7 wt% in weight percentage of TiO2 nanoparticles (average particle size of 20 nm in diameter) with terpineol (69.0%) and ethyl cellulose (10.3%) making up the rest.14 D18NR-T was diluted in absolute ethanol and stirred with a magnetic stirrer bar for 30 minutes. Different weight ratios of PS were chosen to produce the following pastes that contain TiO2:PS = 10:1 and TiO2:PS = 2:1 (w/w). The suspension was then dispersed by a sonication horn (Vibra cell 72408, Bioblock Scientific) to break up any aggregates of nanoparticles (6 times, each time stirred with a magnetic stirrer bar for 5 minutes and sonicated with a pulse (2 s work + 2 s rest) for 30 times). The paste was then transferred to a rotary evaporator at 50 °C, 100 mbar. After evaporating all ethanol in the solution, the remaining paste was homogenized again with a three-roller-mill grinder (EXAKT 80).

2.2. Device fabrication
The prepared pastes were used for screen-printing on a fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) conducting glass electrode (Nippon Sheet Glass 10 Ohm/sq). TiCl4 treatment was performed on the FTO substrate as well as on a screen printed TiO2 electrode (40 mM, 70 °C for 30 minutes).14,15 TiO2 electrodes were immersed in (2-((E)-5-((1,2,3,3a,4,8b-hexahydro-4-(4-(2,2-diphenylvinyl)phenyl)cyclopenta[b]indole-7-yl)methylene)-3-octyl-5-(3-carboxymethyl-4-oxo-thiazolidine-2-ylidene)rhodamine)16 dye solution denoted D205 (0.2 mM with 0.4 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) in a mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol 1:1 (v/v) and 20% chloroform). After that, the sensitized electrode was assembled with a platinized counter-electrode (TEC 7 – Pilkington) with a hot-melt ring of Surlyn (25 μm thick). Ionic liquid Z952 (ref. 17) was used as the electrolyte. Z952 was a melt of 1,3-dimethylimidazoliumiodide (DMII):1-ethyl-3-methylimidazoliumiodide (EMII):1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetracyanoborate (EMT):iodine:N-butylbenzoimidazole:guanidinium thiocyanate of molar ratio 12:12:16:1.67:3.33:0.67. The details of the fabrication process have been described in the literature.15
2.3. Characterization methods
Average diameters of polystyrene spheres after polymerization were determined by a Nanosizer and the morphology was examined with a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) (JEOL-6340F). After screen-printing, the thickness of TiO2 films was measured using a surface profiler (Alfastep 500) and the morphology were captured by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (XLF-30). Optical transmittance and reflectance were measured using an integrating sphere placed in a spectrophotometer (Cary 5). To investigate the amount of dye-loading on films made from varied PS content pastes, the films were sensitized in D205 dye solution for 5 hours, followed by rinsing in acetonitrile twice and dipped in a 2 ml solution of 0.1 mM tetrabutylammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) in 5 minutes for desorption. Absorption spectra of these desorption solutions in a 1 cm path length quartz cuvette were immediately measured to determine the amount of dye uptake on each film. Photovoltaic characteristics were measured by an AM 1.5 solar simulator equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp and an IR-cutoff (KG-3) filter, calibrated with a reference Si photodiode to 100 mW cm−2 using a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter to obtain the I–V curves.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Film characterization

3.1.1. Morphology and thickness. 
The average diameter of synthesized PS spheres was determined using a Nanosizer to be 523 nm. Fig. 1 illustrates the top-view and cross-sectional scanning electron microscope images of the screen-printed nanocrystalline titanium dioxide films showing pores created by the decomposition of polystyrene spheres during calcination. The cavities are randomly arranged and more or less distributed uniformly on the surface. There was partial aggregation of PS spheres in the paste; hence part of the pores, especially in the higher PS content films, are bigger than the original size of PS spheres. A cross-sectional view of PS-templated films revealed the cavities created by burnt PS spheres having ellipsoidal shapes. This is attributed to the shrinking associated with the films during sintering due to the removal of the remaining solvent, binder and decomposed PS resulting in the flattening of the pore shape.

3.1.2. Optical properties. 
Optical properties of TiO2 films were measured using an integrating sphere. From the transmittance spectra (Fig. 2), we observe that the diffuse transmittance component increased gradually when large cavities created by PS were introduced in the films, meaning that light was scattered more strongly in these films compared to the standard transparent one. Diffuse transmittance dominates the total transmittance in PS-templated films, signifying that there was a very small amount of light passing collinearly through the film, explaining the opaque appearance of these films (shown in digital photographs Fig. 2(b)–(d)) in contrast to the transparency of the standard film, though they both contained 20 nm particles. The diffuse transmittance overlapped with total transmittance at about 550 nm and below, suggesting that the light scattering effect was a result of 500 nm cavities that were created by burnt PS. The reflectance data (ESI, Fig. S2†) show a similar effect. The diffuse reflectance increased when the large cavities were created, proving that there was an increment of light reflection and increasing photon path-length in the film.

3.1.3. Dye-loading. 
PS-templated TiO2 films are expected to have lower total surface area than the standard film. BET gas adsorption was performed on sintered TiO2 films scraped from glass substrates, giving the surface area per unit volume of D18NR-T, TiO2:PS = 10:1 and TiO2:PS = 2:1 pastes: 8.67 m2 cm−3, 7.40 m2 cm−3 and 6.02 m2 cm−3 (corresponding to porosities of 68.1%, 70.5% and 76.5% before TiCl4 treatment, respectively). However, these results have to be interpreted with caution since the sample preparation method (involving the scraping of TiO2 films) could result in the collapse of the films due to the high porosity and subsequent brittleness. This could introduce errors in the measurement. Therefore, a dye-desorption experiment was performed as a more trustable and relevant method to quantify the amount of dye uptake in each film without breaking down the highly porous structure. TiO2 films made from D18NR-T paste and PS-templated pastes were immersed in D205 dye solution and then desorbed in TBAOH, followed by measuring the absorption spectra of these solutions (ESI, Fig. S3†). Table 1 shows the calculated amount of dye uptake on TiO2 films made of D18NR-T and PS–TiO2 pastes. A significantly lesser amount of dye (as much as 30%) was grafted on TiO2:PS = 2:1 paste compared to the standard paste from Dyesol. In other words, the more PS was added to the paste, the more porous and lower total surface area the films had, resulting in a lower amount of dye molecules attached to the TiO2 surface.

3.2. Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performance of PS-templated TiO2 films of approximately 10 μm thickness was evaluated against a control sample made of Dyesol 18NR-T paste; employing D205 dye and the ionic liquid based electrolyte Z952. The data are presented in Fig. 3 and Table 2. The control samples yielded an efficiency of 6.3%, while the PS-templated samples had higher efficiencies of 6.9% and 6.5% respectively. It is important to note that the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of PS-templated samples increased compared to that of a standard cell made from Dyesol 18NR-T paste by 10 to 20 mV at a similar film thickness. This improvement was measured throughout the study with a large number of devices showing that it is a reproducible phenomenon. The increment of Voc possibly originates from the lower surface area of the films containing the cavities which results in the reduction of dark current. Furthermore, the large cavities enhance the mass transport of triiodide in the viscous ionic liquid, resulting in a decrease of the diffusion overvoltage and hence the fill factor of the device.

Despite the smaller surface area and lower dye-loading, the photocurrent of TiO2 films prepared with 10% (w/w) polystyrene beads as a macro-pore forming agent exceeds that of the standard cell, Table 2. Thus the gain from better light harvesting overcomes the loss associated with lower dye-loading, resulting in a slight enhancement of Jsc. Interestingly, even when the weight ratio of TiO2:PS is 2:1, equivalent to 30% lower dye-loading, the photocurrent is maintained. Thus the present approach succeeds in reducing the amount of dye utilised while improving the performance of the DSC resulting in higher PCE values. Incident-photon-to-current efficiency was measured to show the effect of light scattering from sub-micrometer cavities to support the previously shown diffuse transmittance data. In Fig. 4b, the IPCE curves clarified that the sample with TiO2:PS = 10:1 had improvement in photocurrent, especially in the red region, confirming the hypothesis that current density increases with light scattering effect in PS-templated films. However, when the amount of PS loaded is higher (TiO2:PS = 2:1), we have 30% lower dye-loading and hence, lower photocurrent.

4. Conclusions
One of the main challenges in fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells is to reduce the cost of fabrication, especially to save materials such as dyes while maintaining the performance of the device. In this study, we incorporated polystyrene spheres into the screen-printing paste to produce a macroporous series of films with large cavities created by burning PS during a sintering process. These films exhibited good light harvesting due to the scattering effect from the hollow cavities, which also results in a lower surface area and smaller dye-uptake. Although the amount of dye molecules attached on these films is smaller, the power conversion efficiency was still maintained and even improved compared to the standard cell, due to the light-scattering effect by the sub-micrometer cavities. The open circuit voltage was enhanced because of less charge recombination sites (lower dark current), while the fill factor was higher because of better diffusion of the viscous ionic liquid electrolyte. Current density was a compromise between the loss of dye-loading and improvement of the prolonged photon path length due to the light-scattering effect. The IPCE showed enhancement of current in the red region when PS was added. This is a promising approach for future solid state and bifacial dye-sensitized solar cells as well as for reducing the cost of fabrication.
