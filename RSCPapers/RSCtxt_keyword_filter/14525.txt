    , Accepted 5th August 2020First published on 6th August 2020AbstractPerovskite films can be prepared using sec-butyl alcohol (2-BA) by a one-step antisolvent assisted method. However, 2-BA dissolves a necessary perovskite precursor, methylammonium iodide, CH3NH3I, (MAI), which is lost during the fabrication, leaving behind residues of another perovskite precursor, PbI2. The resulting perovskite films show reduced power conversion efficiency (PCE) and poor stability to ambient conditions. In this work, we propose an elegant strategy, i.e., the introduction of a small amount of MAI dissolved in the antisolvent 2-BA (1 mg mL−1). The additional MAI can react with the residual PbI2 during the fabrication to form the desired organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite material, CH3NH3PbI3. The high-quality of the perovskite films obtained can provide larger grain sizes and smoother surfaces, with an ideal PCE of 19.29% and superior moisture stabilities.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs), have attracted immense research interest in recent years as huge improvements in power conversion efficiency (PCE) have been reported, i.e., from 3.8% in 2009 to the current value of 25.2%.1–8 These perovskite materials can deliver high performance due to their excellent optoelectronic properties, high carrier mobility, strong optical absorption, long carrier diffusion lifetimes, and suitability for flexible devices.9–14 PSCs are generally considered to be the most promising photovoltaic devices for the future.
The quality of the perovskite film in the PSCs plays a decisive role in the achievement of high efficiencies. Generally, perovskite films are prepared by either a one-step antisolvent assisted method, two-step spin coating method, vapor-assisted solution processing method, or thermal gas-assisted evaporation.15–19 Among all of these methods, the one-step antisolvent assisted method, which was first reported by Zhou et al., is considered ideal for obtaining high-quality perovskite films.20–24 Since then, many PSCs reporting high PCEs, in the range of 20–25%, have been prepared using this method.22–25 At present, chlorobenzene (CB) and toluene (TL) are considered to be the best antisolvents to quench organic solvents of the perovskite precursor, such as g-butyrolactone (GBL), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). In addition, dithyl ether26,27 and anisole28 are also widely used as antisolvents to prepare perovskite films. However, these antisolvents are toxic and dangerous chemicals and are not only used in large quantities during the preparation, but are also released into the atmosphere, thus leading to air pollution.29–31 The one-step antisolvent assisted method cannot be used for PSC manufacture with these antisolvents at a large scale since the environmental cost is too steep. Therefore, new studies have started focusing on using green antisolvents to replace chlorobenzene (CB) and toluene (TL),29,32–34 such as sec-butyl alcohol (2-BA), which promises to be a very environmentally friendly option.32,35 Zhang et al. first reported the use of 2-BA as an antisolvent and obtained a champion PCE of 13.30%.32 Since then, some researchers have further optimized PSCs based on 2-BA antisolvent, such as Li et al. (PCE = 11.99%), Sun et al. (PCE = 16.87%) and Zhang et al. (PCE = 17.32%).36–38 However, when using 2-BA, CH3NH3I (MAI), i.e., one of the perovskite precursors, is dissolved away and its loss needs to be compensated by the addition of more MAI during the washing steps.32,35 The need for excess MAI results not only in high costs but also leaves behind another unreacted perovskite precursor, PbI2, in the perovskite films; reducing both the PCEs and stabilities of the PSCs.35
In this work, we propose a simple strategy to eliminate residual PbI2 in perovskite films by using the antisolvent 2-BA with a small amount, i.e., 1 mg mL−1, of MAI. The MAI/2-BA solution converts excess PbI2 in the perovskite films to CH3NH3PbI3 during the washing process. In the absence of PbI2, the PCE and the fill factor (FF) could be increased to 19.29% and 75.4%, respectively, which shows about an 18.29% enhancement in PCE compared to the control device, and significantly enhanced stabilities of the PSCs. Furthermore, the grain size in the perovskite films could be tuned by the concentration of MAI. The optimized PSCs, without encapsulation, could maintain more than 75% of their initial PCE even after ten days of exposure to moisture.
Experimental section
Materials
Precursors CH3NH3I (MAI), PbI2, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI), Spiro-OMeTAD, and FK209 CO(III) TFSI salt, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), were all supplied by Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Glass/ITO was purchased from Advanced Election Technology Co., Ltd and other materials were provided by Aladdin.
Devices fabrication
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated on laser-patterned, indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass. The patterned glass was sequentially, ultrasonically cleaned with de-ionized water, acetone, ethyl alcohol, and isopropyl alcohol for 15 min each, followed by drying under the flow of nitrogen and treatment in a UV ozone oven for 20 min. After the cleaning procedure, a colloidal solution of SnO2 (2 wt%) was used to obtain a thin layer of compact SnO2 film by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 30 min. The CH3NH3PbI3 precursor, consisting of 461 mg of PbI2 and 174.9 mg of MAI dissolved in 450 μL of DMF and 50 μL of DMSO, was continuously spin-coated onto the SnO2 film substrate, first at 2000 rpm for 10 s and then at 4000 rpm for 25 s. During the second step, 250 μL of sec-butyl alcohol (2-BA), with or without MAI, was added dropwise during the last 15 s. The resulting perovskite film was annealed at 100 °C for 30 min and then spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s with a spiro-OMeTAD solution consisting of 65 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 20 μL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine, 70 μL of Li-TFSI (170 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile), 50 μL of FK209 CO(III) TFSI salt (150 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile), and 1 mL of chlorobenzene. The fabrication of the PSC was completed by adding a layer of thermally evaporated Ag to form an electrode with a thickness of about 100 nm and an effective area of 0.06 cm2.
Characterization
The crystal structure of the perovskite films was examined using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Thermo ARL-X’TRA, America) with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å). A field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Ultra55, ZEISS, Germany) was used to examine the morphology and cross-section of the perovskite films, and the grain size test was used to measure the size of 100 grains randomly selected in the SEM, then calculate the average grain size. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were measured by using an atomic force microscope (PSIA XE-100E, South Korea). The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices were investigated by using a Keithley Model 2400-SCS Source Meter under 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The solar simulator consists of a 500 W Xe lamp (Trusttech, China) and an AM 1.5 filter (Oriel) under AM1.5 radiation (1 sun conditions, 100 mW cm−2). The sweep rate was 0.2 V s−1. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves were tested by using a quantum efficiency (QE)/IPCE measurement system (Solar Cell Scan100/Zolix). The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption was recorded by using a UV-Visible Spectrophotometer (Lambda 900, America). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed on the electrochemical workstation (Zennium Pro, Germany) with a bias of −0.8 V, the process was in the dark state and the frequency range was 0.1–100 KHz. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL) were obtained using a transient fluorescence spectrometer (FluoTime 300, Germany). The excitation wavelength was 375 nm by a pulse laser (LDH-P-C-375B) with a pulse width of <40 ps and a repetition rate of 2 MHz.
Results and discussion
High-efficiency PSCs can be achieved by fabricating perovskite films with high crystallinity and large grain sizes. Herein, we introduced the appropiate amount of MAI into the antisolvent 2-BA to regulate the morphology of CH3NH3PbI3 and obtain the desired properties. The schematic for different fabrication procedures of the CH3NH3PbI3 films made in this study is shown in Fig. 1. MAI can be easily dissolved in the polar solvent 2-BA. The photographs of the transparent and yellow colored solution, which represents 2-BA and MAI/2-BA are demonstrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2, the precursor solution of perovskite is composed of DMF, DMSO, PbI2 and MAI. During the antisolvent dropping, the DMF would be taken away by 2-BA, and form an intermediate phase of PbI2-MAI-DMSO. The existence of DMSO in an intermediate phase can retard the rapid reaction between PbI2 and MAI during the evaporation of solvent in the spin-coating process. Finally, the DMSO evaporates and the intermediate phase is converted into a pure crystalline CH3NH3PbI3 after annealing at 100 °C39–41 for one hour. Due to the easy dissolution of MAI into polar solvent 2-BA, some parts of MAI will be easily dissolved (or washed out) during the formation of an intermediate phase and produce an excess of PbI2, which might seriously hamper the photovoltaic performances and stabilities of PSCs. To deal with this issue, the appropriate amount of MAI herein was introduced into the anti-solvent (1.0 mg mL−1) to produce a proper dynamic equilibrium of MAI between the precursor film and anti-solvent, suppressing the excess of PbI2 and resulting in a high-quality perovskite film.

The SEM images of the perovskite films formed using antisolvents 2-BA and different concentrations of MAI/2-BA (0.5 mg mL−1, 1.0 mg mL−1 and 1.5 mg mL−1) are shown in Fig. 3(a–d), respectively. The corresponding AFM images are also shown in Fig. 3(e–h). In comparison with the control, i.e., the film treated with pure 2-BA, the perovskite film treated with an appropriate concentration of MAI/2-BA shows a smoother morphology. The surface roughness (the root mean square of roughness, Rq) can decrease from 12.1 nm (for the film treated by 2-BA) to 8.9 nm (for 1.0 mg mL−1 MAI/2-BA). However, as the concentration of MAI/2-BA further increases to 1.5 mg mL−1, the Rq obviously increases to 17.2 nm. On the other hand, the smoother film treated by an appropriate concentration of MAI/2-BA could also obtain a larger grain size. The distribution of grain sizes of films treated by conventional 2-BA and 1.0 mg mL−1 MAI/2-BA are highlighted in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The experimental result indicates that the average grain size of the perovskite film treated with MAI/2-BA is 249 nm, which is larger than that of the control (186 nm). This is mainly due to the incomplete chemical reaction between perovskite precursors, MAI and PbI2, as MAI dissolves away when washed with the antisolvent, 2-BA. The chemical reaction of the perovskite synthesis is shown as follows: PbI2 + CH3NH3I → CH3NH3PbI3(1)

The effect of MAI/2-BA is similar to that of the MAI/isopropanol solution used in a two-step spin-coating process.18 In this method, the first step is to prepare a PbI2 film and then spin-coat it with a MAI/isopropanol solution. The reaction to synthesize the required perovskite film, as shown in eqn (1), occurs during spin-coating of the MAI/isopropanol solution.18,42,43 During the interaction of the precursor film with the antisolvent, the MAI/2-BA solution simultaneously dissolves away some MAI from the precursor film and provides more MAI, allowing all of PbI2 to react.
In order to further investigate the morphology of the perovskite films, SEM images of the cross-section were carried out. Fig. 4(f and g) show the layers within the PSCs, i.e., ITO, SnO2, perovskite, and spiro-OMeTAD, in order. The grains in the 2-BA treated film are smaller and more loosely packed (Fig. 4(f)) than the grains in the denser and more uniform MAI/2-BA treated film (Fig. 4(g)). The larger grain sizes and smoother surfaces in the presence of MAI/2-BA are expected to contribute to a decrease in the electron–hole recombination at the interfaces. Consequently, the open-circuit voltage (V) and fill factor (FF) would increase, leading to significant improvements in the photovoltaic performance.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite films treated with 2-BA, i.e., the control, and different concentrations of MAI/2-BA after annealing are shown in Fig. 4(a). The patterns show sharp characteristic peaks of the formation of the tetragonal structure of CH3NH3PbI3. Comparing each sample, the film formed from 2-BA treatment shows an extra peak at 12.76°, which belongs to the (001) plane of PbI2.44,45 After treatment with 0.5 mg mL−1 MAI/2-BA, the peak intensity of PbI2 is obviously weakened. The absence of this peak in the 1.0 mg mL−1 MAI/2-BA treated film confirms that the fabrication method successfully removed the residual PbI2. The XRD patterns of perovskite films annealed by different times are also demonstrated in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The XRD patterns of films before annealing show special different peaks from those after annealing, which is because the films before annealing are mainly composed of the intermediate phase.46 The XRD patterns of different annealing times indicate that the composition of perovskite films will not change obviously (except for the intermediate phase) as the annealing time is appropriately shortened or prolonged. Furthermore, the XRD patterns of other antisolvents have also been investigated. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), no sharp peak of PbI2 could be found in the perovskite films treated by diethyl ether and chlorobenzene. These experimental results indicate that the pure antisolvent of 2-BA will remove the MAI during the washing step, whereas the MAI/2-BA can make up for the loss of MAI and obtain high quality perovskite films.
The photovoltaic performance was studied to evaluate the as-prepared perovskite films and Fig. 4(b) shows the J–V curves (under reverse scan) of four kinds of PSCs, i.e., films treated with (i) 2-BA, (control), (ii) 0.5 mg mL−1 solution of MAI/2-BA, (iii) 1.0 mg mL−1 solution of MAI/2-BA, and (iv) 1.5 mg mL−1 solution of MAI/2-BA, respectively. More details are highlighted in Table S1 (ESI†). The PCE shows the lowest performance, i.e., 10.09%, for the film treated with 1.5 mg mL−1 of MAI/2-BA, followed by 15.20% for the control film, 16.85% for the film treated with 0.5 mg mL−1 of MAI/2-BA and 19.29% for the film treated with 1 mg mL−1 of MAI/2-BA. It is clear that the PCE could be improved with the increase of MAI in 2-BA at the initial stage. However, the PCE decreases abruptly as the concentration of MAI in 2-BA reaches 1.5 mg mL−1, which is due to the presence of excess MAI on the surface of the perovskite film. The excess MAI on the surface would inhibit and hamper hole transport between the perovskite film and the spiro-OMeTAD film. In order to verify the presence of excess MAI on the surface of the perovskite film, the corresponding SEM and XRD experiments were carried out. As shown in Fig. S5(a–c) (ESI†), there is some lumpy matter irregularly accumulated on the surface of the perovskite films, which are marked by red dotted lines. The model diagram of the stacking structure of MAI is inserted in Fig. S5(a–c) (ESI†). A higher concentration of MAI/2-BA would cause more lumpy matter on the surface. Further surface chemistry was studied by XRD (Fig. S5(d), ESI†). It is difficult to detect the characteristic peak of MAI (the concentration of MAI/2-BA <4 mg mL−1) because of the amount of MAI (<4 mg mL−1) on the surface of perovskite film is not sensitive to XRD analysis. However, the characteristic peak at 11.45° can be observed as the concentration of MAI/2-BA reaches 4 mg mL−1 and more. This peak is attributed to MAI accumulation on the surface of perovskite films.32,47 Hence, a high concentration of MAI/2-BA could produce unfavorable MAI residue, which will lead to the decrease of PCE of the devices.
The statistical device performance of 30 devices of each of the four different types of films, i.e., 2-BA alone, 0.5 mg mL−1 of MAI/2-BA, 1.0 mg mL−1 of MAI/2-BA and 1.5 mg mL−1 of MAI/2-BA, were collected for statistical analysis (Fig. S6 (ESI†)). These experimental results show that for the 2-BA treatment PSCs, the average PCE is lower, with a broader distribution of values as compared with the MAI/2-BA treatment (0.5 mg mL−1 of MAI/2-BA and 1.0 mg mL−1 of MAI/2-BA) PSCs. The device treated with 1.5 mg mL−1 of MAI/2-BA lead to a worst performance due to the unfavorable MAI residues on the perovskite surface. The highest reproducibility of the films treated with 1.0 mg mL−1 of MAI/2-BA can be attributed to fewer defects formed by the PbI2 residue, which facilitate the migration of charge carriers. The average PCE reaches the best value at the MAI/2-BA concentration of 1.0 mg mL−1, showing a significant improvement compared to that of control devices.

Fig. 4(c) and (d) show the J–V curves of PSCs fabricated with 2-BA and MAI/2-BA treatment, respectively. To quantify the degree of hysteresis, the hysteresis index was defined by the following equation:48 (2)
The hysteresis factor of the MAI/2-BA PSC is 0.024, which is much lower than that of the control PSC (0.107). The improvement of the device treated by MAI/2-BA is mainly ascribed to the improved perovskite film quality with a lower trap density and more efficient carrier transport and extraction. The integrated Jsc for the devices based on the control and MAI/2-BA is 21.23 and 21.78 mA cm−2, respectively, from the external EQE spectra in Fig. 4e, which is very close to the Jsc from the J–V curves.
UV-vis absorption spectra of the different perovskite films are shown in Fig. 5(a). The MAI/2-BA treated films show higher light absorption than the control, corroborating observations from SEM and XRD that the former possess higher crystallinity, larger grain sizes, and lower residual PbI2. Fig. 5(b) shows an electrochemical investigation using Nyquist plots, which is fitted by an equivalent circuit model, as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 5(b), and the corresponding fitting values of series resistance (Rs), and recombination resistance (Rct) are given in Table S2 (ESI†). A clear semicircle can be observed for both the devices, which corresponds to the charge transfer at ITO/SnO2/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM interfaces and relate to recombination resistance.49,50 The Rct of the device treated by MAI/2-BA is significantly larger than those of control devices, implying that the charge can more efficiently inject to the hole transport layer (HTL) and electron transport layer (ETL) as the electron–hole recombination is suppressed,49,50 therefore improving the photovoltaic performance, which is consistent with the previous J−V test results.

The charge recombination dynamics of the perovskite films was studied by steady photoluminescence (PL) spectra as shown in Fig. 5(c), the excitation light is impinged on the surface of the perovskite films, and the inset image displays the device structure. The MAI/2-BA treated devices show a stronger PL intensity, implying higher quality of the perovskite film with less trap-states.51,52 The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra presented in Fig. 5(d) further elaborate the nature of the charge recombination dynamics. The decay curve is fitted to the following biexponential decay function: (3)
The average decay lifetime can be calculated by the equation: , and more detailed fitted data is available in Table S3 (ESI†). These experimental results indicate that τavg increases from 9.2 ns for the control film to 25.1 ns for the MAI/2-BA treated films. The increase in decay lifetime indicates relatively low non-radiative recombination of the high quality perovskite film treated by MAI/2-BA, thus improving the photovoltaic performance of the device.52 In addition, we further measure the PL and TRPL of the perovskite film deposited on SnO2 (Fig. S7 (ESI†)), and more detailed fitted data is available in Table S4 (ESI†). The excitation light is incident from the ITO side. The perovskite film treated by MAI/2-BA deposited on the SnO2 film has a more strongly quenched PL and a faster decay than the control, presenting the superior charge carrier-extraction capability due to a high quality film with a lower trap-state density.53–55
To further investigate the trap-state density in perovskite films, the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) technique was applied to the ETL-only devices with a structure of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PCBM/Ag. Dark J–V curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 5(e). The trap-state density (Ntrap) is determined by the equation: (4)where ε is the relative dielectric constant of the perovskite, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, VTFL is the trap-filled limit voltage, e is the electron charge, and L is the thickness of the perovskite.56 The trap-state densities of perovskite films treated with 2-BA and MAI/2-BA are calculated to be 1.1 × 1016 and 0.9 × 1016 cm−3, respectively. The perovskite film treated with MAI/2-BA shows a much smaller VTFL than that of the control film, implying the former has a lower trap-state density. Then, the light intensity dependent Voc for the two antisolvent based devices is investigated to analyze the charge carrier recombination details (Fig. 5(f)). The slope of Vocversus log-scaled light intensity is kT/q. Here, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the kelvin temperature and q is the elementary charge. The lower slope of the PSCs treated with MAI/2-BA is 1.36 kT/q, which is lower than the control device (1.92 kT/q). This result implies that the trap-state density is effectively suppressed.57
Finally, the impact of moisture on the different PSCs were studied, as shown in Fig. 6. The devices were prepared without any encapsulation to investigate long-term ambient stability. The control device showed a rapid deterioration in photovoltaic performance, the PCE significantly decreased to 20% after 5 days of exposure to ambient air (RH ∼ 50%), and fell to ∼0% after 7 days. In contrast, the MAI/2-BA treated PSC demonstrated a significantly lower deterioration rate and maintained 75% of PCE after 10 days of ambient air exposure. These durability studies provide clear evidence of the higher quality and promising applicability of the MAI/2-BA treated PSCs.

Conclusion
In summary, we successfully optimized the performance of the environmentally friendly antisolvent 2-BA by a simple innovative modification to the fabrication procedure, i.e., introducing an appropriate amount of MAI into the antisolvent 2-BA. As a result, high-quality perovskite films, with the absence of excess PbI2, larger grain sizes, smoother surfaces, lower trap-state density, higher crystallinity, higher electron–hole recombination resistance, and superior charge carrier-extraction capability at the perovskite-SnO2 interface, were obtained. The optimized planar device achieved high values of Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE, i.e., 22.84 mA cm−2, 1.12 V, 0.754, and 19.29%, respectively, while the control PSC only showed a PCE of 15.20% under the same conditions. These improved features resulted in substantial improvement in the stability of PSCs in the presence of moisture, making this a promising, eco-friendly and commercially viable method.
