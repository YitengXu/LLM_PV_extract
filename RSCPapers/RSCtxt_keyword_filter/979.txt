As a result, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of the PSCs is 7.99% for the device with VOPc(OPyC2H5Br)8 as a cathode interlayer. Although increasing the alkyl side chains attached to the pyridine functional groups of phthalocyanine leads to a slight decrease of PCE, VOPc(OPyC6H13Br)8 can form a better, denser and more uniform film on the active layer as demonstrated by atomic force microscopy, energy dispersive spectrum mapping and contact angle measurements.
1. Introduction
The energy crisis is threatening humans with the depletion of fossil energy. We are eager to find clean and renewable energy sources. Against this background, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention owing to their key advantages of light weight, low cost, large-area roll to roll fabrication and the lucrative possibility of integration directly into flexible devices.1–6 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has rapidly increased to over 10% with good ambient stability for single cell devices.7–9 However, the efficiencies of the PSCs obviously lag behind their inorganic counterparts, thus limiting their practical application. Until now, more and more effort on the development of new materials and new device structures is high desired in order to improve the device performance. Owing to unique nature of the stacked thin film architecture, the performance of the PSCs is critical dependent on the properties of interfaces which plays a critical role in the processes of photo harvesting, charge carrier generation, transporting and collection.10 Therefore, engineering and optimization of the interface have proven to be a very effective approach toward enhancing the performance of the PSCs in recently years. One of key technology of interfacial engineering to achieve such a high efficiency is application of a solution-processed cathode interlayer (CIL) in PSCs. This kind of CIL was firstly used as an electron injection layer in polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs)11–13 and then applied to organic field effect transistors (OFETs)14,15 and recently in PSCs.16,17
Stimulated by this motivation, various types of CIL materials have been explored. Currently reported CILs improving the device performance mainly consist of polymers and organic small molecules because they combine the advantages of flexible synthesis and tunable structure. As reported in ref. 18–45, a large variety of polymers and small molecules have been targeted for use as solution-processable interfaces in PSCs, including electrolytes tethered with different polar groups of N,N-dimethylamino, ammonium salts, phosphonate and metal ion-intercalated crown ether. Their performances are comparable to those of conventional PSCs with LiF as a CIL. Compared to polymers, the small molecules have advantages of well-defined structures, high-purity without batch-to-batch variation and easy modification. However it is more difficult for alcohol/water soluble small molecular CILs to form a high-quality uniform film than polymer CIL, in particular on the hydrophobic active layer.
Recently we reported a water-soluble metallophthalocyanine (MPc) derivative with pyridine salts VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 as a CIL leading to a simultaneous enhancement in open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of the PSCs. As a result, a PCE of 8.12% for the working areas of 2 × 2 mm2 and a PCE of 7.23% for the working areas of 4 × 4 mm2 have been achieved.44 However, VOPc(OPyCH3I)8-treated surface of PTB7:PC71BM blend showed a rough morphology with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 9.34 nm. Notably, there are some visible islands distributed over the surface. The formation mechanism of the islands may be the self-aggregation of VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 itself due to its high polarity and adverse wettability of VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 aqueous solution on the hydrophobic active layer. Such a rough morphology is usually unfavorable for the device efficiency, especially for Jsc, FF and stability. Therefore, it is necessary to improve film formation of alcohol/water soluble small molecular CILs on hydrophobic active layer in order to further increase device performance of the PSCs.
In this contribution, we have explored the effect of alkyl chain on hydrophobicity and the film uniformity. Three CIL materials have been intentionally synthesized by changing alkyl side chains attached to the pyridine functional groups of phthalocyanine as shown in Fig. 1. The highest PCE value of the PSCs is 7.99% for the device with VOPc(OPyC2H5Br)8 as an interlayer. Although the PCE was a little reduced when the chains change longer, the abundant flexible alkyl chains attached to the center core of VOPc(OPy)8 promote the uniform film formation on the lying organic layer. Such a chemical modification provides the molecule with an ideal balance between the solubility in polar solvent and adhesive property on active layer surface. The longer alkyl chains afford the MPc derivatives sufficient solubility in alcohol and hardly soluble in water, which makes it better wettability as CIL on the hydrophobic active layers. We have sacrificed the interface dipole in order to obtain the good film-forming property. It provides a helpful suggestion for the development of high photovoltaic performance and high-quality film interfacial materials.

2. Results and discussion
Detailed UV/vis absorption spectra of MPc derivatives were recorded in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). As shown in Fig. 2, three molecules almost present the same bands: S and sharp Q band. The optical band gap (Eoptg) was calculated using the equation: 
Eoptg = 1240 × λedge−1
(1)where λedge is the onset value of the absorption spectrum of MPc derivative in the DMF solution in the direction of longer wavelength. Electrochemical properties of three MPc derivatives are shown in Fig. 3. From the onset of reduction potential, the LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy level was estimated. The HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) energy level was calculated using LUMO and Eoptg, the details was listed in Table 1.

The MPc derivatives were used as CILs in the PSCs based on a blend of PTB7 and PC71BM as an active layer, and Al as a cathode. Device architecture is presented in Fig. 1. In order to highlight the function of MPc derivatives as CILs in the PSCs, we prepared the following devices:
Device 1: [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/Al]
Device 2: [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/water/Al]
Device 3: [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/methanol/Al]
Device 4: [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/VOPc(OPyC2H5Br)8/Al]
Device 5: [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/VOPc(OPyC4H9Br)8/Al]
Device 6: [ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC71BM/VOPc(OPyC6H13Br)8/Al]
For comparison, the three control devices have been fabricated. In Device 1, Al was directly deposited on the active layer. In Device 2 and Device 3, Al was deposited on the active layer treated by the solvents of MPc derivatives. It aims to figure out that MPC derivatives mainly contributed to enhanced PSC performance rather than their solvents.
Fig. 4 shows current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the above six PSCs under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. Open circuit (Voc), short circuit (Jsc), fill factor (FF), power conversion efficiency (PCE) are summarized in Table 2. Under illumination, the devices with MPc/Al as a cathode show a Voc of 0.740 V (Device 4), 0.735 V (Device 5) and 0.734 V (Device 6), which are higher than Voc values of the control devices with (Voc = 0.700 V, Device 2; Voc = 0.715 V, Device 3) and without (Voc = 0.679 V, Device 1) the treatments of solvents. The increase in Voc can be mainly attributed to the reduced work function (WF) of Al cathode. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopic (UPS) measurements were carried out with monochromatized HeI radiation at 21.2 eV. Fig. 5 shows UPS spectra of bare Al, Al treated by solvents and Al covered by ∼5 nm MPc in the secondary electron cutoff region. WF is defined by secondary electron cutoff in the UPS spectrum. As a result, WF of bare Al is 4.20 eV, Al/water is 3.62 eV, Al/methanol is 3.55 eV, Al/VOPc(OPyC2H5Br)8 is 3.32 eV, Al/VOPc(OPyC4H9Br)8 is 3.34 eV and Al/VOPc(OPyC6H13Br)8 is 3.42 eV. UPS measurements demonstrated that the WF of Al was decreased due to the treatment of solvents or coverage of MPc on the Al surface. In addition, a VOPc(OPyC2H5Br)8 interlayer is more efficient for minimizing the WF of Al. The increased Voc is also consistent with the increased built-in potential (Vbi) across devices with CILs. This speculation can be supported by the dark J–V characteristics of devices in Fig. 6. In the dark, devices with CILs exhibit a turn-on voltage around 0.784 V (Device 4), 0.778 V (Device 5) and 0.770 V (Device 6), while they are around 0.760 V for Device 3, 0.730 V for Device 2 and 0.710 V for the Device 1, respectively. It indicates that the Vbi of the devices increase when introducing as a CIL or solvents treatment. Because Vbi influences the internal electric field in the PSCs and gives the upper limit for the Voc provided that the WF difference of electrodes is larger than the donor HOMO–acceptor LUMO offset of the bulk heterojunction.46 Thus the increase of Vbi may be responsible for the increase in Voc in the devices with CILs and devices with the treatment of solvents.

More importantly, PCE of devices with CILs are higher than Device 1 (5.12%), 2 (5.59%) and 3 (6.59%) due to simultaneous enhancement in Voc, Jsc and FF as presented in Table 2. It is clear that an introduction of MPc between active layer and Al cathode results in the improved PCE and the contribution from the solvents to the PSCs performance is relatively smaller even though solvents treatment can slightly improve Voc and FF. Table 2 also presents series resistances (Rs) and shunt resistances (Rsh). Measuring the inverse slope of J–V characteristics under illuminated is one of the most straightforward techniques to estimate Rs and Rsh. Compared to the two control devices, a decrease of Rs and an increase of Rsh are apparent when MPcs were utilized as CILs. The increases of Jsc and FF of the devices with CILs can be attributed to the resistance changes.47
In order to ensure the validity and repeatability of data, we measured at least 30 pixels (size = 2 × 2 mm2) for all device configurations. The average PCE values of Device 1–6 are 5.06%, 5.52%, 6.51%, 7.86%, 7.81% and 7.76%, respectively. In order to detect a discrepancy of Jsc which easily leads to overvalued PCE, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the Devices 1–6 from 350 nm to 800 nm are carried out and shown in Fig. 7. The Jsc values calculated from integration of the EQE spectra are 13.94 mA cm−2 for Device 1, 14.11 mA cm−2 for Device 2, 15.37 mA cm−2 for Device 3, 16.74 mA cm−2 for Device 4, 16.58 mA cm−2 for Device 5 and 16.36 mA cm−2 for Device 6, which are in good agreement with the Jsc = 13.98 mA cm−2 of Device 1 (ca. 0.3% error), the Jsc = 14.22 mA cm−2 of Device 2 (ca. 0.8% error), Jsc = 15.34 mA cm−2 of Device 3 (ca. 0.3% error), Jsc = 16.61 mA cm−2 of Device 4 (ca. 0.8% error), Jsc = 16.43 mA cm−2 of Device 5 (ca. 0.9% error) and Jsc = 16.41 mA cm−2 of Device 6 (ca. 0.3% error) obtained from J–V characteristics under illumination. It indicates that the Jsc values measured for the cells are reliable and PCE values presented in this manuscript are not overvalued.48

Compared to the control devices, devices with MPc show a higher FF value as listed in Table 2. It implies that introduction of MPcs effectively improved charge transport ability, in particular for electron transport. In order to confirm that introducing MPc films enhance electron transport in the PSCs, the mobilities of electron were measured in the electron-only devices using space charge limited current (SCLC) method49 according to the following equation: 
J = 9/8ε0εrμV2L−3
(2)where ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the dielectric constant of the active layer, μ is the electron or hole mobility, V is the voltage drop across the device, L is the active layer thickness. The above equation holds if the mobility is field independent. Fig. 8 demonstrates J0.5–V characteristics for the electron-only devices, where Vr (the voltage drop due to contact resistance and series resistance across the electrodes) and Vbi (the built-in voltage due to the difference in work function of the two electrodes at both sides of active layer) are subtracted from experimental applied voltage. εr is assumed to be 3.9 in our analysis. A straight line going through the origin of J0.5–V curves for the devices signifies that the mobility is field independent at field up to 2 × 105 V cm−1. The field independent mobilities calculated from eqn (2) are listed in Table 3. It is clear that the mobility of electron without any treatment on the active layer is 1.34 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, the mobilities of electron for the devices with MPc as CILs are 4.01 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (VOPc(OPyC2H5Br)8), 4.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (VOPc(OPyC4H9Br)8) and 6.50 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (VOPc(OPyC6H13Br)8), respectively. Enhanced electron mobility in the PSCs is believed to contribute to the enhanced Jsc and FF observed in the solar cells by reducing the build-up of space charges and charge recombination. Reduced surface traps, optical spacer effect, and increased built-in potential might also be the possible reasons.

Fig. 9 shows the surface morphologies obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measured at ambient. The surface of PTB7:PC71BM BHJ film is smooth with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.79 nm (Fig. 9a). The solvent-treated surface of PTB7:PC71BM was slightly smoother than the pristine film due to a RMS roughness of 2.13 nm (water) and 2.04 nm (methanol). When a PTB7:PC71BM blend is covered by MPc films, the RMS roughness of the surface becomes 4.01 nm (VOPc(OPyC2H5Br)8), 2.66 nm (VOPc(OPyC4H9Br)8) and 1.99 nm (VOPc(OPyC6H13Br)8), respectively. We can see that the CIL films become more uniform when the alkyl chains attached to the pyridine functional groups of MPc were longer. Moreover VOPc(OPyC6H13Br)8 has a better film-forming property on PTB7:PC71BM blend than famous alcohol soluble polymer PFN, because the RMS roughness of PFN on the PTB7:PC71BM is 3.41 nm (Fig. S1†). Notably, VOPc(OPyC6H13Br)8 film has solved the problem with sharp island formation of MPc derivatives, e.g. VOPc(OPyCH3I)8 on the hydrophobic active layer. We assign it to the increasing chain length attached to the pyridine functional groups, which can enhance the compatibility and adhesive characteristic on active layer.

In order to further study the film formation and uniform distribution on the active layer, we detected distributions of metal elements. Energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) mapping images of MPc derivatives on PTB7:PC71BM BHJ films are shown in Fig. 10, where the green dots are vanadium element. Apparently massive dots for vanadium elements in VOPc(OPyC6H13Br)8 have densely covered background for PTB7:PC71BM in Fig. 10c. However, dots for vanadium elements in VOPc(OPyC2H5Br)8 are much sparser and a large area of the background is uncovered as shown in Fig. 10a. It is a strong evident that VOPc(OPyC6H13Br)8 can form a better, denser and more uniform film on the active layer than VOPc(OPyC2H5Br)8.

In addition, contact angle (θ) measurements were performed in order to investigate polarity of treated surfaces of PTB7:PC71BM film as shown in Fig. 11. Fig. 11a–f show contact angle images of water droplets on the surfaces of PTB7:PC71BM film without and with solvents treatment, covered by VOPc(OPyC2H5Br)8, VOPc(OPyC4H9Br)8 and VOPc(OPyC6H13Br)8, respectively. The water contact angles of the MPc surfaces are 63.1°, 76.5°, 92.3°, respectively. It indicates that the treatments of both solvents and VOPc(OPyC6H13Br)8 only slightly changed the surface polarity of PTB7:PC71BM. The surfaces of PTB7:PC71BM/VOPc(OPyC6H13Br)8 is still hydrophobic due to θ ≈ 92.3°. However, the surface of PTB7:PC71BM/VOPc(OPyC2H5Br)8 is hydrophilic due to θ ≈ 63.1°. The contact angle measurements once more provide a powerful proof that increasing the alkyl chains promote the wettability of the CIL material on the surface of the active layer and VOPc(OPyC6H13Br)8 has a larger potential to form a high-quality film.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, three metallophthalocyanine (MPc) derivatives have been synthesized and successfully utilized as CILs in the PSCs based on PTB7:PC71BM as an active layer. A simultaneous increase of Voc, Jsc and FF resulted in an overall PCE enhancement due to an introduction of MPc derivatives. As a result, max. PCE value of the PSCs was 7.99% for the devices with VOPc(OPyC2H5Br)8 as a CIL. However, VOPc(OPyC6H13Br)8 realized the more uniform deposition on the lying organic layer due to introducing the longer alkyl chains attached to the pyridine functional groups of phthalocyanine with a little smaller PCE (7.88%). So VOPc(OPyC6H13Br)8 is a new promising candidate as a good CIL for large area PSCs. Such a chemical modification not only can enhance the compatibility and adhesive characteristic on the active layer, but also improve the solubility in alcohol. As a result, the interlayer material displayed better wettability on the hydrophobic active layer. Therefore, it should be an efficient strategy to exploit more excellent cathode interlays for highly efficient PSCs.

4.2 Device fabrication and characterization
Fabrication of polymer solar cells and electron-only devices: ITO glass substrates were pre-cleaned carefully and treated with oxygen plasma for 7 min. Firstly PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP Al 4083) was spin-coated onto a cleaned ITO and annealed in air at 120 °C for 10 min. Secondly, blend films of active layers were spin-casted from solution on PEDOT:PSS. For PTB7:PC71BM PSCs, the active layer was formed by spin-coating from the chlorobenzene:1,8-diiodoctane (97:3 vol%) solution consisting of 10 mg mL−1 PTB7 and 15 mg mL−1 PC71BM, then dried in vacuum. ∼5 nm CIL materials (the thickness was estimated by the attenuation of Au 4f core-level signal of Au substrates in the XPS measurement) were deposited on the active layer by spin-coating (VOPc(OPyC2H5Br)8 1.6 mg mL−1 dissolved in water; VOPc(OpyC4H9Br)8 1.2 mg mL−1 dissolved in methanol:water = 1:1 mixed solvent; VOPc(OPyC2H5Br)8 0.8 mg mL−1 dissolved in methanol) and then 100 nm Al was evaporated as a cathode. For the electron-only devices, the device structures was: ITO/Al/PTB7:PC71BM/with or without CIL/Al. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured under N2 atmosphere in the glove box by using a Keithley 2400 under illumination and in the dark. Solar cell performance was tested under 1 sun, AM 1.5 G full spectrum solar simulator (Photo Emission Tech. Inc., model #SS50AAA-GB) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a standard silicon photovoltaic traced to the National Institute of Metrology, China. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured using Q Test Station 2000 (Crowntech Inc. USA) at room temperature in air. In addition, the static contact angles of the as-prepared surfaces were measured with a commercial contact angle system (DataPhysics, OCA 20) at ambient temperature. AFM images were measured with an S II Nanonaviprobe station 300 HV (Seiko, Japan) in contact mode. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) image was taken with a JEOL FESEM 6700F electron microscope with primary electron energy of 3 kV. Energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) mapping was conducted with Inca X-Max instruments made by Oxford Instruments.
