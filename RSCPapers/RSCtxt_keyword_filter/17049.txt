Phonon calculations reveal that, among the possible crystal structures, three different phases; namely 1H, 1T, and square, are dynamically stable. In addition, ab initio molecular dynamics calculations show that these three phases are thermally stable up to well above room temperature. Another important stability factor of crystals, the chemical inertness against abundant molecules in the atmosphere, such as N2, O2, H2O, and CO2, is also investigated. The analysis shows that SrCl2 single-layers are chemically stable against these molecules. Moreover, it is determined that in contact with H2O and CO2, ultra-thin SrCl2 sheets display unique electronic features, allowing them to be used in sensing applications. It is also shown that single layers of SrCl2 crystals, all having a wide electronic band gap, can form type-I and type-II vertical van der Waals heterostructures with well-known 2D materials such as MoS2, WSe2, and h-BN.
1 Introduction
Alkaline earth halides with their high ionic conductivity and stability hold promise for practical applications in a wide range of fields.1 Also, they are promising building blocks for upcoming nanotechnology products. The fusion temperatures of alkaline earth halides are of great importance for the interpretation of the phase balance and electrical conductivity measurements in metal–metal halides.2 As a well-known Grignard reagent,3,4 MgBr2 is used for removal of silyl protecting groups and catalysis in diastereoselective hydrogenation reactions of alkenes.5,6 In addition, CaF2 is used in various applications such as dentistry, diode pumps, ceramic lasers and the insulating layer in transistors.7–14 Bulk BaF2, with its transparent crystal structure from the UV to IR regions, has been reported as a useful material for infrared spectroscopy and medical imaging systems.15–18 Another member of the family, SrCl2, has found applications in dentistry and biology.19–22
Demonstrating efficient results in a variety of fields in its bulk form, SrCl2 has also gained interest in a low dimensional form. A thin layer SrCl2 electrolyte was reported to be an efficient sensor for measuring the partial pressure of hydrogen.23 Using SrCl2 thin films in designing a chemisorption composite was shown to improve overall adsorption efficiency.24 In addition, it was observed that thin films of SrCl2 can also play an important role in solar cell applications. Environmentally friendly SrCl2 is used as an alternative to CdCl2 in thin film solar cells, which improves the efficiency of the cell.25 Moreover, it was also shown that passivation of perovskite thin film solar cells with a spin-coated SrCl2 layer enhances the power conversion efficiency over 21%.26
Nowadays, as a result of rapid advances in experimental studies, dimensional reduction of materials can be carried out even down to few-atom thickness. Following the discovery of graphene,27,28 synthesis of novel ultra-thin metals (borophene, TaS2),29,30 semiconductors (MoS2, WSe2 ReS2, Xenes),31–39 insulators (h-BN, CaF2, CaCl2, CaBr2, CaI2),40–43 and ferromagnetic crystals (CrI3, Cr2Ge2Te6, VI3, MnSe2)44–48 has been reported. It has also recently been reported that doped monolayers of HfSe2, C3N are good candidates for sensing applications.49,50 Although the macro-scale forms have been studied previously, to the best of our knowledge, ultra-thin forms of SrCl2 crystals have not yet been reported.
In this study, motivated by recent advances in synthesis of ultra-thin graphene-like structures, possible atomically-thin 2D crystal structures of SrCl2 are investigated. In Section 2 a detailed explanation about the computational methodology is given. Structural properties of the 1H, 1T, and square phases of SrCl2 crystals are given in Section 3. The vibrational, thermal and chemical stabilities of the three phases are examined in Section 4. In Section 5, the electronic properties and band alignments of the possible vertical heterostructures of the stable SrCl2 single-layers are investigated. Finally, our results are concluded in Section 6.
2 Computational methodology
In this study the structural, vibrational and electronic properties of single-layer 1H, 1T and square SrCl2 crystals were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) embodied in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).51,52 The energy of exchange and correlation was evaluated by using Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) parameters with expanded crystal wave functions on the basis of a plane wave set using periodic boundary conditions in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA).53 Plane-wave projector augmented-wave (PAW) was used with the projector to accurately represent valence–core interactions.54 The charge transfer between atoms was determined by the Bader technique.55
A plane wave cutoff of 500 eV was used for SrCl2 phases. Convergence criteria of 10−4 eV and 10−5 eV were taken between individual ionic and electronic steps, respectively. For structural and electronic properties, 0.05 eV Gaussian smearing was used. The vacuum space was taken as at least 15 Å, in order to prevent any interaction between adjacent layers. Geometric relaxations were allowed until the pressures became less than 1 kB in all directions. The cohesive energies per formula were calculated using eqn (1). (1)
Vibrational properties are calculated using the small displacement method implemented within the PHON and PHONOPY codes.56,57 For the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, the NVE ensemble is used. The k-point sampling is chosen as 3 × 3 × 1 for a 4 × 4 × 1 supercell. A time step of 2 fs is used in the dynamical simulation. The temperature is increased from 0 K to 2000 K in a total simulation time of 2 ps.
3 Structural properties of possible SrCl2 structures
Bulk strontium chloride crystallizes in a fluorite-type structure and its ionic arrangement can be described as face-centered cubic. Single-layer structures of 1H, 1T, and square phases can be obtained by truncation of bulk SrCl2. In this study, possible single-layer structures of SrCl2 in 1H, 1T, and square phases are investigated. Total energy differences and optimized structures of 1H, 1T and square phases of SrCl2 are presented in Fig. 1. Within its single-layers, the 1T-SrCl2 structure has a relatively low cohesive energy (0.35 eV) with respect to the square phase while the square phase has a lower cohesive energy (0.04 eV) with respect to the 1H phase. Lattice parameters of the optimized crystal structures of the primitive unit cell of the bulk, 1H, 1T and square phases are 4.99, 4.18, 4.42 and 3.70 Å, respectively. Sr–Cl bond length varies between 2.92 and 3.08 Å where 1T has the shortest and the square phase has the longest bond length, which indicates that the cohesion between Sr and Cl atoms is the strongest in the 1T phase and weakest in the square phase. These results are supported by the cohesive energies of SrCl2 single layers, as given in Table 1. Moreover, Bader analysis reveals that the bonds between Sr and Cl atoms have ionic character in all single-layer SrCl2 structures formed by 0.8 e− charge donation from Sr to Cl atoms as in the bulk form.

Furthermore, the elastic properties for these three novel phases of SrCl2 are calculated. The in-plane stiffness values of the 1H, 1T, and square phases are respectively 20, 20 and 51 N m−1, which makes them softer materials compared to in-demand materials like graphene (330 N m−1), MoS2 (122 N m−1) and h-BN (273 N m−1). The Poisson ratio of the 1H phase is 0.47, which is closer to silicene (0.41) and germenene (0.42). The Poisson ratio of the 1T phase is 0.24 and this value is closer to the values of various materials such as h-BN (0.22) and MoS2 (0.26).59 Among the possible single layer structures of SrCl2, the Poisson ratio of the square phase is found to be the smallest one (0.05) indicating its structural robustness against compressive and tensile uniaxial strain. Further investigations on the structural stability of the phases of single layer SrCl2, obtained from total energy optimization calculations, are performed in the following sections.
4 Dynamical, thermal and chemical stability
The dynamical stability of the possible structures of SrCl2 crystal structures and their characteristic Raman active phonon modes and constant volume heat capacities can be investigated through their phonon dispersions. It is seen from Fig. 2 that the phonon spectrum of the 1H, 1T, and square SrCl2 phases is composed of 3 acoustic and 6 optical phonon branches and the dynamical stability of these crystal structures can be deduced from phonon eigenfrequencies all taking real eigenvalues through the whole Brillouin zone. As a result of structural symmetry in 2D, SrCl2 single-layers have 2 double-degenerate in-plane and 2 non-degenerate out-of-plane optical phonon modes at the Γ high symmetry point.

(d) Constant volume specific heat capacities of 1H, 1T, and square SrCl2 single-layers. (e) Average Sr–Cl bond lengths of SrCl2 with temperature. 
For the 1H phase, analysis of the lattice dynamics shows that the decomposition of the vibration representation of optical modes at the Γ point is Γopt = 2E′′ + 2E′ + A1′ + A2′′. The 1H structure has double-degenerate in-plane E′ (145 cm−1) and E′′ (92 cm−1) modes and non-degenerate out-of-plane modes A1′ (216 cm−1) and A2′′ (223 cm−1). Phonon eigendisplacements shown in the lower panel of Fig. 2 reveal that E′, E′′, and A1 phonons are Raman-active lattice vibrations. In addition, the A2′′ mode shows IR activity. Similarly, the 1T phase with its crystal structure that belongs to a D3d point group has double-degenerate Eg (140 cm−1) and Eu (148 cm−1) modes and non-degenerate A1g (158 cm−1) and A2u (198 cm−1). However, in the 1T phase, differing from the 1H phase, there is a large gap between optical phonons and acoustic phonons. It is calculated that a square phase has double-degenerate E′′-like (61 cm−1) and E′-like (102 cm−1), and nondegenerate A2′′-like (204 cm−1) and A1′-like (222 cm−1) modes in its spectrum. Moreover, it is seen that in the square phase formed by relatively weak Sr–Cl bonds, the in-plane optical modes are softened with respect to the 1H and 1T phases. As reported experimentally, differing from its single layer forms, the bulk form of SrCl2 has only one Raman active phonon branch at 184 cm−1.58 Here, the presence of distinctive Raman-active modes in each single layer crystal structure provides a useful recipe for experimental characterization via Raman spectroscopy. Constant volume specific heat capacities (Cv) of the 1H, 1T, and square SrCl2 crystals are also calculated. Fig. 2(d) shows that as the temperature increases, all phonon modes are stimulated and the specific heat of the structures approaches the limit value of 3NkB (where N is the number of atoms per unit cell). It is also seen that dimensional reduction of the bulk leads to an increase in Cv at low temperatures.
For examination of the thermal stability of SrCl2 monolayers in the 1H, 1T, and square phases, ab initio MD simulations are performed from 0 to 2000 K. Fig. 2(e) illustrates the average Sr–Cl bond length as a function of temperature in the MD simulations. In each phase, bond variance is negligible at low temperatures. Apparently, one can conclude that SrCl2 single layers are thermally stable at room temperature. However, it is seen that, for 1H and square phases, temperature-induced distortion in the average Sr–Cl bond length becomes significant especially over 1000 K. Here, the thermal stability of the 1T phase at higher temperatures can be explained via its phonon spectrum that shows a phonon band gap of 45 cm−1 between the acoustical and optical modes. Apparently, such decoupling prevents thermal-energy-driven simultaneous excitation of optical and acoustical modes.
Structural stability against atmospheric conditions, that directly determines the electronic and optical stability, is another important property desired for technological applications. In order to examine the chemical stability of the SrCl2 single-layers, we investigate how strong the interaction is between their surface and atmosphere abundant molecules N2, O2, H2O, and CO2, see Table 2. To find the most favorable adsorption site of the H2O molecule over the 1H, 1T and square SrCl2, total energy calculations are performed at different points on the surface. It is calculated that over the three surfaces, the H2O molecule strongly binds (between 538 and 575 meV) to the crystal structure with a covalent bond between the Sr and O atoms. In this case the Sr–O distance is found to be 2.55 Å. In addition, N2 molecules weakly bind over the SrCl2 single-layers, with an average 3.5 Å interatomic distance with neighboring Cl atoms. The binding energies between the 1H, 1T, and square phases and N2 molecule are 56, 69, and 62 meV, respectively. These energy values indicate that the N2 molecule has lower binding energy in the range of hydrogen type bonding. Similarly, the binding energy of O2 (CO2) over 1H, 1T and square phase crystals is found to be 52 (93), 72 (100), and 67 (122) meV, respectively. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3, the partial density of states (PDOS) profile of the molecule–surface systems also provide characteristic signatures. Localized states of N2 and O2 molecules in the PDOS agree with the structural optimizations and binding energy calculations indicating the weak interaction between the SrCl2 crystals and the molecules. On the other hand, instead of displaying localized states, CO2 and H2O present coupled states with the SrCl2 crystals in the PDOS. As a result, SrCl2 single-layers are inert against abundant molecules such as N2 and O2; however, they present electronic interaction with CO2 and H2O molecules. Thus, it has been found that SrCl2 single-layer crystals can be used to sense CO2 and H2O.

5 Electronic properties and possible vertical heterostructures
We also investigate the electronic characteristics of the SrCl2 single-layers through their electronic band structures. In addition to bare-GGA calculations, we perform GGA+HSE calculations to better approximate the expected experimental electronic bandgap. Therefore, the bandgaps of bulk, 1H, 1T and square SrCl2, listed in Table 1, are calculated to be 5.21, 5.08, 5.80, and 3.70 eV using the bare-GGA functional and 6.55, 6.47, 7.19, and 5.82 eV using the GGA+HSE hybrid functional, respectively. As seen in Fig. 4, the 1H phase has a direct band gap with the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) located at the M high-symmetry point; however, the 1T and square type crystal structures are indirect band gap materials. Obviously, all three phases of ultra-thin SrCl2 are wide band gap semiconductors in their bulk form and may find various applications in high power electronics.60 In addition, the work functions of the 1H, 1T, and square phases are determined as 7.88, 7.74, and 7.59 eV, respectively. In comparison to the well-known single-layer materials, currently used in technology, such as MoS2 (5.1 eV) or h-BN (4.7 eV),61 the work functions of the predicted single-layer phases of SrCl2 crystals are significantly higher.
 Fig. 4  The calculated band structures of the (a) 1H, (b) 1T, and (c) square phases using bare GGA and GGA+HSE functionals are presented by red and blue lines, respectively, and the GGA+HSE band gaps are shown with blue area. (d) Comparative band alignments of 1H, 1T, and square SrCl2 phases with well-known single-layers MoS2, WSe2, and h-BN. 
Furthermore, one can deduce what type of vertical heterojunctions are formed with these ultra-thin SrCl2 crystals by comparing their electronic band structures and vacuum levels. As seen in Fig. 4(d), the band alignment of SrCl2 single-layers is compared to well-known monolayers such as MoS2, WSe2, and h-BN by adjusting the vacuum energies to zero. It is seen that the vertical heterostructures of MoS2 with SrCl2 in the 1H, 1T, and square phases form type I heterojunctions with a straddling type bandgap. On the other hand, heterostructures formed by 1H, 1T, and square phases of SrCl2 crystals with WSe2 and h-BN are type II heterojunctions with a staggered type bandgap.
6 Conclusions
In this study, novel SrCl2 single-layers were investigated by performing state-of-the-art first-principles calculations. In addition to total energy optimizations, phonon dispersion analysis showed that 1H, 1T, and square phases of SrCl2 are also dynamically stable crystal structures. Further investigation of their vibrational properties revealed that SrCl2 single-layers have characteristic Raman active modes, which enables characterization via Raman spectroscopy. Thermal stability of the SrCl2 single-layers was also confirmed by MD simulations. It was also shown that the 1T phase, which displays a decoupling between acoustic and optical modes, has a better thermal stability. In addition, distinctive interactions of SrCl2 single-layers with CO2 and H2O can be utilized in sensing applications. Additionally, electronic structure calculations reveal that while 1H-SrCl2 has a direct bandgap of 6.55 eV, the 1T and square phases have an indirect bandgap of 6.47 and 7.19 eV, respectively. Due to their wide band gaps, SrCl2 single-layers can be used as potential dielectric layers. It was also shown that predicted stable ultra-thin SrCl2 semiconductors with wide bandgap semiconductor behavior can form type-I and type-II van der Waals heterojunctions with well-known single layer crystals and therefore may find applications in nanoscale optoelectronics.
