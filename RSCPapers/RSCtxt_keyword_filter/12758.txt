1. Introduction
Subporphyrinoids – comprising subporphyrins (SubPs),1–5 subporphyrazines (SubPzs),1,6 benzosubporphyrins (BzSubPs)1,4,5,7 and subphthalocyanines (SubPcs)1,8–10 as the four cornerstones – are curved, aromatic macrocycles that constitute a class of extremely versatile and attractive compounds. By virtue of their relatively recent discovery2,3,6,7,10 and their outstanding physicochemical properties, the study of these contracted porphyrinoids represents a still young but rapidly expanding research area. Subporphyrinoids differ from other porphyrin analogues in the size of the macrocycle, which is composed of three pyrrole or isoindole units, and exclusively coordinate a boron atom within their binding core (Fig. 1). The boron tetrahedral coordination imposes to these 14 π-electron compounds a characteristic cone-shaped geometry, rendering subporphyrinoids one of the few known examples of non-planar aromatic molecules. As a result, subporphyrinoids exhibit peculiar structural, optical and electronic features which make them intriguing candidates for a wide variety of applications ranging from optoelectronics to biomedicine.

A comprehensive review on subporphyrinoids was presented by some of us in 2014.1 Since then, an impressive number of publications has been reported dealing with the synthesis, study and application of these fascinating derivatives, which highlight the huge interest of the scientific community in this fervent field. Remarkable progress has been made in the chemistry of SubPcs, which represent the first discovered macrocycles in the family of subporphyrinoids. Novel strategies have been presented for the derivatization of the preformed SubPc macrocycle. Crucial advances have been made in understanding the organization features of SubPcs, and a plethora of SubPcs as dimeric, oligomeric and polymeric systems has been described. The ground- and excited-state interactions of SubPc-based multicomponent systems have been thoroughly investigated, laying the foundations for their implementation in solar energy conversion schemes. Important steps forward have also been made in the application of SubPcs in the biomedical area. In addition, substantial progress has been done in the synthesis and reactivity of the younger SubPs, SubPzs and BzSubPs congeners, and several new analogues have been reported.
Herein, we present a review of the most recent advances in the chemistry of all these contracted porphyrinoids. The first part of the review is dedicated to SubPcs, which constitute by far the most investigated subporphyrinoids. We will first discuss the synthetic procedures for the preparation of SubPcs, which trimeric structure is invariably assembled through boron-templated cyclotrimerization of phthalonitrile derivatives. In addition, we aim at providing an overview of the reactivity of these macrocycles, with a special emphasis on the methodologies for the post-functionalization of the axial and peripheral positions. Then, we will describe the supramolecular organization of SubPcs in the crystalline solid state, as well as in thin films, on surfaces, in solution and in the mesophase. We will next examine all-SubPc as well as hybrid, SubPc-containing multicomponent systems. In this connection, we will give a special focus to the photophysics of donor–acceptor systems based on SubPcs. Finally, we will describe the applications of these subporphyrinoids, with a particular emphasis on their exploitation as molecular materials in organic photovoltaics.
The second part of this review is devoted to SubPs, BzSubPs, SubPzs, as well as their structurally related analogues. In this case, a great assortment of synthetic procedures and starting materials to assemble the very different structures will be described. We will particularly emphasize on the youngest SubPs, since they are by far the subporphyrinoids for which a wider variety of synthetic procedures and post-functionalization methods has been developed. Comparisons between the physicochemical properties of SubPs and those of their better-studied SubPc relatives will be made. We will also describe recent advances in the synthesis of SubP-based multicomponent systems and initial studies on their technological applications, an aspect that remains in its infancy. A comprehensive overview of the chemistry of the SubPz and the subnaphthalocyanine (SubNc) families is also included. Reported for the first time more than 25 years ago, SubNcs have been the object of recent interest for their application in solar technologies.
In summary, the final aim of this review is to bring out the outstanding chemical, structural, optical and electronic features of subporphyrinoids, while providing an updated view of the most promising applications of these fascinating macrocycles.
2. Subphthalocyanines
SubPcs are aromatic macrocycles composed of three N-fused 1,3-diiminoisoindole units arranged around a boron atom, which also bears an axial substituent. The 14 π-electron conjugated system of these derivatives is mainly located in the inner ring, whereas the isoindolic benzenes virtually preserve their electronic structure. Hereafter, the XnSubPc–Y notation will be employed to refer to SubPc species, where X and n indicate the nature and the number of the substituents linked to the isoindolic benzene rings, respectively, and Y stands for the apical ligand (Fig. 2). In the presence of peripheral substituents different from hydrogen atoms, the latter will not be indicated.

2.1 Synthesis of subphthalocyanines

2.1.1 Synthetic approaches for subphthalocyanine synthesis. 
The main outcomes on SubPc synthesis published during the first four decades after their discovery10 have been reviewed by some of us in previous works.1,8 Here, general considerations on SubPc preparation are reported and the major results presented since our last review on SubPcs and other contracted porphyrinoids are discussed.1
SubPcs are synthesized through cyclotrimerization reaction of one (or more) phthalonitrile derivative(s) in the presence of a boron-based Lewis acid at high temperatures (generally, above 140 °C) in high-boiling aromatic solvents. To date, no reports have been published on the synthesis of “free-base” SubPcs or SubPc derivatives featuring a central atom different from boron, which preparation constitutes one of the foremost challenges in SubPc chemistry. However, the possibility to incorporate central atoms different from boron within the SubPc core has been widely investigated through theoretical calculations, as will be described in Section 2.3.9.
BCl3 constitutes undoubtedly the most employed boron reagents in SubPc synthesis. Although to a lesser extent, BBr3 is also quite commonly used for the preparation of SubPc derivatives. Upon reaction of these Lewis acids with a starting phthalonitrile, the corresponding SubPc-Cl and SubPc-Br species are formed, respectively. The reason why BCl3 constitutes by far the most used boron halide in SubPc synthesis despite its lower reactivity in comparison with BBr3 lies in the higher stability of axially chlorinated SubPcs with respect to the corresponding brominated analogues.
Some significant improvements have been introduced in the synthetic methodology for the preparation of SubPc-Cl derivatives since their serendipitous discovery in 1972. For three decades after their first preparation, SubPcs have been mainly synthesised by addition of an excess of BCl3 – as a condensed liquid or as a solution in low-boiling solvents – to the starting phthalonitrile dissolved in a high-boiling solvent.11 In 2003, a highly efficient method for the preparation of axially chlorinated SubPcs involving the use of p-xylene solutions of BCl3 was presented by Torres, Schucmann and co-workers.12 The general protocol presented in this work consists in the addition of 1 equiv. of BCl3 from a 1 M solution in p-xylene to the starting phthalonitrile under argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture is then refluxed for a time depending on the nature of the phthalonitrile precursor (Scheme 1). This approach presents several advantages over the use of condensed BCl3. First of all, the use of a BCl3 solution allows to control the stoichiometry of the reagents, thus minimizing side reactions related to the use of large excesses of a strong Lewis acid. In particular, p-xylene is a very good solvent for precursor phthalonitriles and has a sufficiently high boiling point to allow for its use in SubPc synthesis. Moreover, this solvent can efficiently reduce the chlorine released during the preparation of the SubPc core (please refer to Section 2.1.4 for further details on the mechanism of SubPc formation), preventing the formation of peripherally chlorinated SubPc by-products. Finally, the set-up of the reaction is easier.
 Scheme 1  General synthesis of SubPc-Cl derivatives. 
This approach represents nowadays the most employed methodology for SubPc synthesis. Nevertheless, it is worth to mention that minor variations have been introduced in this procedure in some cases. A possible modification consists in employing a 1 M solution of BCl3 in p-xylene in the presence of a co-solvent (e.g. chlorobenzene,13o-dichlorobenzene,14,15 or 1-chloronaphthalene16).11 SubPcs synthesis has also been carried out by addition of a 1 M solution of BCl3 in heptanes17–19 or dichloromethane20–27 to a solution of the starting phthalonitrile in a high-boiling solvent such as p-xylene,22,24 1-chloronaphthalene,18o-dichlorobenzene,17,19,21,23,25,26 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene20 or dimethyl sulfoxide.11,27 Microwave irradiation has also been employed for SubPc preparation.28,29 In this case, a heptane solution of BCl3 was used in the presence of 1-chloronaphthalene or o-dichlorobenzene as the co-solvent.
As mentioned above, the preparation of axially brominated SubPcs is less reported than that of SubPc-Cl derivative due to the lower stability of the former, which may lead the hydrolysis of the initially formed halogenated SubPc to the corresponding SubPc-OH species during the synthesis and work-up procedures. Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that the higher reactivity of the B–Br bond may represent an advantage in axial ligand exchange reactions (see Section 2.2.1). For the preparation of SubPc-Br derivatives, BBr3 is commonly added as a neat liquid to a solution or suspension of the precursor phthalonitrile in a high-boiling solvent such as, for example, chlorobenzene,30o-dichlorobenzene,23 1-chloronaphthalene,31 or toluene/bromobenzene mixtures.11
Notably, the attempted synthesis of Cl6SubPc-Br 1 from 4,5-dichlorophthalonitrile and BBr3 in chlorobenzene was found to lead to the formation of a mixture of axially brominated and chlorinated Cl6SubPc derivatives 1 and 2, as reported by Bender and co-workers (Scheme 2).30 In contrast, cyclotrimerization of 3,4,5,6-tetrachlorophthalonitrile in the same reaction conditions proceeded smoothly, affording solely the axially brominated Cl12SubPc derivative. The authors indicated the solvent rather than the starting phthalonitrile as the possible source of chloride, as no evidence of peripheral bromination was found in the formed macrocycles. A similar halogen exchange was observed a few years later by the same group during cyclotrimerization of 4,5-difluorophthalonitrile and 3,4,5,6-tetrafluorophthalonitrile in the presence of BCl3 to form the corresponding SubPc-Cl derivatives (Scheme 3).32 In this case, the concomitant formation of the axially fluorinated conjugates 5 and 6 was observed along with the formation of the target SubPc-Cl derivatives 3 and 4, which was ascribed to the degradation of the precursor phthalonitriles. In light of this findings, the decomposition of the chlorinated phthalonitrile should be consider as a possible rationale in the formation of Cl6SubPc-Cl from 4,5-dichlorophthalonitrile and BBr3.30

2.1.2 Isomerism in subphthalocyanine synthesis. 
2.1.2.1 Regioisomerism in subphthalocyanine synthesis. 
Cyclotrimerization of non-C2v-symmetric phthalonitriles lead to the formation of a mixture of C1-symmetric and C3-symmetric SubPc constitutional isomers, which separation is commonly carried out by column chromatography on silica gel.33,34 For meta-substituted SubPcs, these regioisomers are obtained in a statistical 1:3 C3:C1 ratio. On the contrary, in the case of ortho-substituted SubPc derivatives, steric and electronic effects play a significant role in the regioselectivity of the cyclotrimerization reaction due to the proximity of the peripheral substituents to the SubPc core. As an example, 1.5:1, 1.75:1 and 1:9 C3:C1 ratios have been observed in the presence of peripheral nitro, iodo and propylsulfonyl groups, respectively.33 Notably, cyclotrimerization of 3-nitro-5-t-butylphthalonitrile afforded a mixture of C3 and C1 regioisomers in a 9:1 ratio, which substantially differs from the 1.5:1 ratio found in the synthesis of the ortho-(NO2)3SubPc derivative.31 In 2015, the regioselective synthesis of a C3-symmetric ortho-pentafluorosulfanylphenyl-substituted SubPc (7, Fig. 3) was reported.35 The selectivity observed in the cyclotrimerization reaction of the corresponding phthalonitrile was attributed by the authors to the steric hindrance of the SF5 group. Interestingly, the preparation of the trifluoromethylphenyl-substituted analogue lead to the obtention of a mixture of both the C3 and C1 regioisomers.

2.1.2.2 Stereoisomerism in subphthalocyanine synthesis. 
Due to their cone-shaped geometry, SubPcs are intrinsically non-centrosymmetric. As a consequence, each of the C1- and C3-symmetric constitutional isomers obtained from cyclotrimerization of phthalonitriles lacking C2v symmetry is inherently chiral and is obtained as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers (i.e. M and P for the C3 regioisomer, MPP and MMP for the C1 regioisomer, Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Possible isomers of a trisubstituted SubPc featuring a meta functionalization pattern. 
The first report on the optical resolution of racemic SubPcs was published in 2000 by Claessens and Torres.34 In this work, the enantiomers of both C3- and C1-symmetric meta-substituted I3SubPc-Cl were separated by analytical chiral HPLC. Two years later, Kobayashi et al. reported the semipreparative resolution of the C3 regioisomer of a SubPc prepared from cyclotrimerization of 3-nitro-5-t-butylphthalonitrile, which allowed the measure of the first circular dichroism (CD) spectra of enantiopure SubPc species.31 Almost a decade later, the optical resolution of a C3-symmetric and a C1-symmetric 1,2-SubNc derivative by chiral HPLC was presented by Shimizu and co-workers.36 Remarkably, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of the isolated enantiomers allowed to establish a correlation between CD spectra and absolute configuration of optically pure SubNc species. The enantiomers of a C3-symmetric SubPc-F bearing three peripheral arylamide groups were also separated by means of analytical chiral HPLC, and the self-assembly properties in solution of the racemic and the enantiopure species were investigated (see Section 2.4.4.1 for further details).37,38 Very recently, the solid-state organization of racemic and enantiopure C1- and C3-symmetric SubPc derivatives bearing fluorine as substituent at both the axial and peripheral positions of the macrocycle was investigated by Miyajima and co-workers (see Section 2.4.1.1).39
An alternative approach for the resolution of inherently chiral SubPcs consist in the derivatization of a racemic SubPc with an enantiopure chiral auxiliary, followed by separation of the resulting diastereomers and removal of the resolving agent from the isolated diastereomeric derivatives. In this connection, a high degree of diastereoselectivity has been observed during the oxidation of an asymmetric SubPc derivative bearing an ortho thioether substituent to the corresponding sulfoxide derivative, which resulted from the intrinsic chirality of the SubPc core.40 As a matter of fact, a 95:5 diastereomeric mixture was obtained in the investigated conditions, and the two diastereomers could be separated by column chromatography. Remarkably, the oxidation of the meta-substituted analogue did not show any selectivity as it led to the formation of a 1:1 mixture of diastereomers, which could only be separated by HPLC.
Regarding the introduction of chiral moieties through derivatization of either the axial or the peripheral positions of the SubPc macrocycle, the synthesis of a couple of SubPc dimers bearing either a racemic BINOL or an enantiopure (R)-(+)-BINOL bridge was presented in 2003 by Kobayashi, Durfee and co-workers.41 Notably, CD measurements on the optically active derivative (8, Fig. 5) evidenced an induced CD on the SubPc generated by the chiral binaphthyl unit. More than a decade later, two chiral SubPcs bearing three peripheral (R)- or (S)-1,1′-bi(2-naphthoxy) moieties (9R/S, Fig. 5) were reported.20,42 Also in this case, an CD signal in the SubPc absorption range induced by the chiral ligands was observed.
 Fig. 5  Structure of the optically active BINOL-bridged SubPc dimer and the chiral binaphthoxy-functionalized SubPcs reported by Kobayashi, Durfee, Jiang and co-workers.20,41 
Recently, the preparation of peripherally perhydrogenated and perfluorinated SubPc derivatives bearing a 1,1,4,4-tetracyanobuta-1,3-diene (TCBD)–aniline moiety at the axial position of the macrocycle (10 and 11, Fig. 6) was reported by Guldi, Torres, Bottari and co-workers.43 Due to the restricted rotation around the central bond of the TCBD unit and the quasi-orthogonal arrangement of the two dicyanovinyl halves, each of these conjugates is formed as a racemic mixture of two atropisomers, which were successfully separated by chiral HPLC. Notably, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of the isolated enantiomers allowed to unambiguously assign their absolute configuration. Moreover, the racemization process was thoroughly investigated by experimental and theoretical studies.44 CD measurements either in the presence or in absence of stimuli (i.e. light and molecular oxygen) showed that in both derivatives enantiomer conversion is boosted upon illumination of oxygen-free solutions, whereas in absence of light or in the presence of oxygen no racemization take place. DFT calculations confirmed the exceptionally high thermal stability of the enantiopure species and evidenced a substantial lowering of the energy barrier of isomerization (i.e. 15 kcal mol−1 and 21 kcal mol−1 approximately for 10 and 11, respectively) upon excitation. Notably, similar energy barrier values were found upon computing racemization from the S1 and the T1 excited states. These findings, along with the well-known ability of molecular oxygen as triplet-state quencher, support a peculiar light-triggered racemization mechanism enabled by triplet-state photogeneration, which could be rationalized on the basis of structural and kinetic considerations. Interestingly, the racemization behaviour of these TCBD-substituted SubPc derivatives substantially differs from that of a SubP analogue bearing a TCBD–aniline unit in the axial position (see Section 6.4.5).45 For the latter, a thermally induced racemization was observed. Two SubPcs functionalized at their peripheral or peripheral and axial positions with three or four TCBD–aniline moieties, respectively, (12 and 13, Fig. 6) have also been prepared.46 In these derivatives, the presence of multiple axially chiral TCBD moieties along with the C3 symmetry of the peripheral functionalization pattern and the cone-shaped geometry of the SubPc macrocycle results in the formation of several stereoisomers. Surprisingly, quite sharp 1H-NMR spectra were registered at room temperature, due to the rapid interconversion between isomers on the NMR timescale. Such interconversion is significantly slowed down at low temperatures, as evidenced by the increasing of multiplicity, the broadening and shifting of the proton signals.

2.1.3 Synthesis of low-symmetry subphthalocyanines. 
Unsymmetrically substituted SubPcs can be prepared through cross-condensation reaction of different phthalonitrile precursors. In this way, a mixture of SubPc derivatives differing in the nature, the number and the position of the ring substituents is obtained. Due to the low tendency of SubPcs towards aggregation in solution, the separation of these products in generally achieved through common chromatographic techniques, in contrast to what observed in phthalocyanine (Pc) chemistry. Nevertheless, solubility issues or intermolecular interactions between side chains may prevent the separation of all the formed compounds.
Both steric factors and relative reactivities of the starting phthalonitriles toward the boron reagent play a role in the selectivity of the reaction, although a clear tendency cannot be defined due to the scarceness of reports on this topic. In general, the selectivity of the reaction can be partially controlled tuning the stoichiometry of the reaction in terms of molar ratio between the starting phthalonitrile species. During the last years, the synthesis of several unsymmetrical SubPc derivatives has been reported, including the preparation of low-symmetry SubPcs bearing peripheral ortho-substituents.14,17,47–58


2.1.4 Mechanism of subphthalocyanine formation. 
The first computational investigation on the formation mechanism of H12SubPc-Cl from phthalonitrile in the presence of BCl3 was reported in 2007 by Torres and co-workers.59 In this work, a two-phase mechanism was proposed in which oligomerization of the dicyanobenzene unit to build the macrocycle framework is followed by formation of the final SubPc valence system through a reductive step. In the first stage, Lewis acid activation of the starting dinitrile by BCl3 was deemed to trigger the formation of an intermediate species, from which an open trimer is obtained through successive additions. A ring-closing step was claimed to complete the formation of the macrocyclic framework. In this phase, the importance of the central boron atom as template able to ensure the spatial arrangement required for cyclization was underlined, along with the role of BCl3 as activating agent through formation of the initial phthalonitrile–BCl3 adduct. In the second stage, reduction of the system via BCl3-catalyzed concerted elimination of Cl2 from the close-ring oxidized precursor was argued to afford the final SubPc valence system.60 A decade after this pivotal study, the crucial catalytic role of BCl3 was clearly unveiled by an in-depth DFT study on SubPcs’ formation mechanism, in which a twenty-three-step reaction pathway was disclosed.61 As a matter of fact, BCl3 was argued to act as chloride-transfer shuttle in a number of elementary reactions involved in the formation of the SubPc macrocycle, thus reducing the activation barrier of the process. Moreover, the importance of the boron halide as activating and templating agent was confirmed. In particular, two molecules of boron halide were claimed to be involved in the initial activation of the starting phthalonitrile, each one coordinating one of the cyano groups of the precursor species (Fig. 7).

2.2 Reactivity of subphthalocyanines
Over the years, SubPcs have proved to constitute a class of extremely versatile compounds in terms of chemical modification of the macrocyclic system. Traditionally, SubPc reactivity has been classified in three main categories, depending on the reactive center and the nature of the target product: (a) axial reactivity, (b) peripheral reactivity and (c) ring-expansion reactions.1 In axial and peripheral reactivity, the reactive center consists in the axial B–Y bond and the functional groups linked to the isoindolic benzene rings, respectively. Both maintain the structure of the macrocycle, and result in the formation of functionalized SubPcs. On the other hand, ring expansion reactions, in which the reactive center is constituted by the imine-type SubPc core, determine the loss of the SubPc macrocyclic framework affording low-symmetry Pcs.
Although the preparation of asymmetric Pcs has constituted one of the first applications of SubPcs, the interest in the chemical modification of these macrocycles has been shifted almost completely over the decades to the functionalization of the SubPc axial and peripheral positions. As a matter of fact, the restrictions imposed by the use of boron reagents in SubPc synthesis in terms of variety of both axial and peripheral substituents prompted the development of numerous strategies for the post-functionalization of the preformed macrocycle. Importantly, tailoring the molecular structure of SubPcs permits to tune their physical, photophysical and electrochemical features (see Section 2.3 for further details).62 Moreover, the introduction of proper functionalities allows the control of the organization features of these macrocycles, besides enabling the preparation of dimeric, oligomeric or polymeric SubPc-based structures, as well as the integration of SubPcs in multicomponent systems (see Sections 2.4–2.6). Thus, investigation on novel approaches in SubPc axial and peripheral reactivity is of paramount importance in SubPc chemistry.
Besides these reactivity modes, Sessler, Guldi, Torres and co-workers presented in 2012 a novel type of reactivity in which the SubPc acts as π-ligand towards the arenophilic Ru(II) in the presence of [Cp*Ru(MeCN)3]PF6 leading to the formation of ruthenoarene π-complexes of SubPcs.63 Direct functionalization of either the axial phenol moiety or one of the isoindolic benzene rings of the SubPc precursor was found to take place. Regarding the π-metallocene complexation of the curved SubPc surface, coordination of either the endo or the exo π faces of the SubPc was observed, with a higher reactivity towards the convex π surface.
An additional type of reactivity consists in the coordination or protonation of the meso-nitrogen atoms of the SubPc ring in the presence of Lewis acids or Brønsted acids, respectively.64 Evidence of complexation of the SubPc macrocycle in the presence of boron or aluminum halides as well as H2SO4 has been reported by the groups of Bender and Torres.1,65,66 Recently, the reversible protonation of the azomethine bridge of the SubPc macrocycle in the presence of organic Brønsted acids was studied by Decréau and co-workers through UV-vis, NMR and IR spectroscopic assays.67 In particular, the number of protonated sites was shown to depend on the pKa of the acid employed as well as on the peripheral substitution pattern of the SubPc, which was argued to regulate the basicity of the meso-nitrogen atoms.

2.2.1 Axial reactivity. 
Substitution of the axial ligand represents a recurrent method for the functionalization of the SubPc macrocyclic system. The reason why axial reactivity has been thoroughly employed for the derivatization of SubPcs rely on a combination of different factors. First, the reaction protocols for axial substitution reactions are generally simple. Second, modification of the axial ligand permits to preserve the electronic properties of the macrocycle, which are mainly determined by the ring substituents. Third, functionalization of the apical position allows to avoid the synthesis of asymmetrical SubPc. Moreover, the introduction of proper axial functionalities can improve the solubility and stability of SubPc derivatives.
As a result of the peculiar coordination of the central boron atom, modification of the axial substituent involves reactions that are specific of SubPcs chemistry. In particular, the low reactivity of the tetracoordinated boron atom constitute a major drawback for axial functionalization. Thus, harsh conditions are generally required, which may lead to the decomposition of the macrocyclic system. Nevertheless, efficient methodologies have been developed for axial substitution reactions, which are based on the generation of activated SubPc intermediates that are susceptible to react with a variety of nucleophiles under mild reaction conditions (Scheme 4).
 Scheme 4  Axial substitution reaction in SubPcs via an activated SubPc-OTf intermediate68 (left) and via activation with AlCl3 (right).65,87 
A one-pot, two-step procedure for the replacement of the axial ligand in SubPc-Cl derivatives was presented by Guilleme, González-Rodríguez and Torres in 2011 (Scheme 4).68 In this protocol, a highly electrophilic SubPc species with a weakly coordinating axial triflate anion is prepared in situ by reaction of an axially chlorinated SubPc derivative with AgOTf or Me3SiOTf. Subsequent reaction of the SubPc-OTf intermediate with a nucleophile in the presence of a hindered tertiary amine (i.e. DIPEA) affords the corresponding axially-substituted SubPc species. The scope of this reaction comprises alkyl and aryl alcohols, carboxylic acids, alkyl thiols, thiophenols, amines, imidazole and pyrrole, as well as aliphatic and aromatic carbon nucleophiles in the form of magnesium bromide derivatives. During the last decade, this methodology has been widely employed for the preparation of axially functionalized SubPc derivatives.57,69–84
A couple of SubPc-OTf species have been isolated, and their crystal structures reported.85,86 The reactivity of the hydrogenated SubPc-OTf species was further studied by Fu and Wang.86 Treatment of the triflate derivative with a bulky base such as lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (LiHMDS) in the presence of ethers, amides or ketones was found to promote the cleavage of the C–O and CO bond in such substrates (Scheme 5). The authors proposed as active species in the C–O and CO bond cleavage the highly reactive ion pair (SubPc)B+N(TMS)2−, which is supposed to be formed upon treatment of SubPc-OTf with LiHMDS. Such species is likely to lead in absence of substrate to the formation of the quenched Lewis adduct (SubPc)BN(TMS)2 and of (SubPc)BMe through Si–C cleavage, which were obtained in a 1:1 approximate ratio as revealed by 1H-NMR and ESI-MS measurements. As a matter of fact, the X-ray crystal structure of (SubPc)BMe was reported, and the ionic (SubPc)B(OCHNMe2)+OTf− species, which results from treatment of the transient ion pair with DMF, was also isolated and crystallized. Anyway, no direct evidence of the formation of the (SubPc)B+N(TMS)2− ion pair was reported.
 Scheme 5  Reactivity of H12SubPc-OTF towards ethers, amides and ketones in the presence of LiHMDS.86 
In another axial substitution protocol presented by Morse and Bender in 2012, the generation of an activated SubPc species is accomplished upon treatment of the SubPc-Cl or SubPc-Br precursor with AlCl3 (Scheme 4).66 In these conditions, a complex is formed in which the aluminum interacts with the axial halogen and meso nitrogen atoms of the macrocycle, which confers to the SubPc solution a characteristic deep blue color. Addition of the nucleophile and subsequent quenching of the resulting complex with a Lewis base such as pyridine afford the corresponding substituted SubPc. Through this methodology, oxygen-, sulphur- and nitrogen-based aromatic nucleophiles could be introduced at the apical position of the SubPc macrocycle.
Activation by AlCl3 was exploited some years later by Nielsen and co-workers for the axial ligand exchange reaction of SubPc-Cl with TMS-protected alkynes to afford axially alkynyl-substituted SubPcs (Scheme 4).87 This protocol allows for the use of milder reaction conditions (i.e. room temperature and absence of basic reagents) in comparison with the ones commonly employed for the axial functionalization of SubPcs with alkyne nucleophile (vide infra). Axial substitution was carried out through this methodology in the presence of alkynes bearing electron poor or electron rich aryl group, TMS-protected triple bonds, ferrocenyl moieties or azulenyl groups. Allyl-TMS was also found to react with SubPc-Cl under the same conditions, affording the corresponding SubPc featuring a B–C(sp3) bond (Scheme 6). In addition, a SubPc–Fc conjugate in which the Fc unit was directly anchored to the central boron through one of the cyclopentadienyl carbon atoms was prepared following the same procedure, with a significant improvement in yield with respect to a previously reported procedure involving the use of lithiating agents.88 In the attempt to obtain the axially substituted aryl-SubPc through formation of a direct B–C(sp2) bond by reaction of SubPc-Cl and 1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene under the same conditions, the corresponding boronic ester was formed instead, although in low amount, upon demethylation of central methoxy group and substitution of the axial halogen by the oxygen atom.87 The protocol presented by Nielsen has been exploited over the years for the preparation of intriguing SubPc derivatives and SubPc-containing multicomponent systems.56,58,75,89,90 Among them, it is worth to mention the multi-step preparation of a series of SubPc-based acetylenic scaffolds upon exploiting the connection of the central boron atom of two SubPc units to the geminal alkynyl position of a tetraethynylethene moiety, which acts as bridging unit (see Section 2.5.2.3 for further details).75

Besides the approaches which involve the generation of intermediate activated species, several works have been published in which axial substitution in SubPcs is performed by direct reaction with specific nucleophiles. In general, harsher conditions are employed in these reactions. A summary of the older publications dealing with axial reactivity have been already reported by some of us.1 Here, the most common procedures employed for these axial substitution reactions are described, along with some recent examples.
2.2.1.1 Formation of B–O bonds. 
The replacement of the B–Y bond with a B–O bond represents by far the most common approach for axial functionalization of SubPcs. In particular, aryl alcohols constitute undoubtedly the most employed oxygen nucleophiles, as their reactions with SubPcs are generally simple and efficient. Moreover, the introduction of a phenol moiety in the axial position is known to improve the solubility and the stability of the SubPc conjugates. In this context, a report was presented in 2012 by Bender and co-workers in which the solubility of SubPcs in organic solvents was significantly tuned upon varying the number and position of methyl groups in the axial aryloxy moiety.91 As a matter of fact, 3-methylphenoxy- and 3,4-dimethylphenoxy-substituted SubPcs were found to be two orders of magnitude more soluble than 4-methylphenoxy- and phenoxy-substituted SubPcs in chloroform. The dramatic improvement of SubPc solubility in the presence of a meta methyl group on the aryloxy axial moiety was ascribed by the authors to symmetry factors.
Axial substitution of the axial chlorine atom with phenols is commonly carried out by refluxing the starting SubPc-Cl with the corresponding alcohol in a high-boiling point aromatic solvent such as toluene,46–48,50,53–56,58,70,73,76,91–117 1:1 toluene/THF mixture,118 chlorobenzene,17,119 dichlorobenzene (DCB)29,30 and o-xylene.120 Interestingly, reaction of SubPc-Cl, SubPc-Br and mesylated SubPcs with phenols in DMF was found to afford the corresponding formate derivative in addition to the target phenoxy conjugate and the hydrolyzed SubPc-OH product (vide infra).121 Axial substitution with phenols can be performed by a one-pot two-step procedure without purification of the chlorinated precursor, by adding the aryl alcohol and the solvent directly to the crude cyclotrimerization product.17,47,48,50,53,54,56,58,92,97,100,102,105,106,111,114,118,120 In some cases, a base such as 1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene (DBU),92,110,118 triethylamine,47,53,70,73,99,109 pyridine103,113 or DIPEA76 is added to neutralized the generated HCl. The use of microwave irradiation for axial substitution with hydroxy-pyridine in o-DCB has also been reported.29 Tin(IV) chloride has been used as activating agent in the same solvent at 60 °C.122
An in-depth investigation on the mechanism of the axial ligand exchange reaction between SubPc-Cl derivatives and phenols was reported in 2014 by Torres, Corral, González-Rodríguez and co-workers.123 In this work, a bimolecular σ-bond metathesis mechanism was postulated, in which the phenol assists in weakening the B–Cl bond by proton coordination concomitantly with the formation of the B–O bond. The peculiar chemical environment of the tetracoordinated boron atom in SubPc derivatives justifies such an intriguing mechanism, not common in the chemistry of boron derivatives. Considering the proposed mechanism, a number of experimental and theoretical findings could be rationalized. As a matter of fact, kinetic measurements showed that at low conversions a bimolecular second-order rate equation reliably fits the experimental data. DFT calculations confirmed the predicted individual rate orders, and revealed a double-well reaction profile involving a four-centered bimolecular transition state of the rate-controlling step in which two bonds (B–X and O–H) undergo dissociation and other two bonds (B–O and H–X) undergo formation in a concerted mechanism (Fig. 8). In addition, the effect of several parameters such as the nature of the SubPc axial and peripheral substituents, the electronic features of the phenol and the characteristics of the solvent on the rate of axial substitution were investigated. The axial ligand exchange reaction rate was found to increase upon changing the axial halogen atom in the order Br > Cl > F and in the presence of electron-donating groups at the SubPc periphery. Moreover, faster axial substitution reactions were detected in the presence of phenols bearing an electron-withdrawing group at the para position. Regarding solvent effects, increasing polarity resulted in an enhancement of the reaction rate, while the use of coordinating solvents led to slower reactions.

Based on these results, González-Rodríguez, Torres and co-workers presented in 2015 a novel methodology for axial substitution in SubPc-Cl derivatives based on reaction with TMS-protected nucleophiles, which allows for the efficient introduction of aryloxy substituents at the apical position of the macrocycle (Scheme 7).85 In these conditions, a volatile by-product (i.e. Me3SiCl) is generated, which pushes the equilibrium to the right and simplify the purification of the target SubPc derivatives. Moreover, the TMS functionality decreases the nucleophilicity of the substrate, reducing the generation of side products from SubPc decomposition. Similarly to what observed for the reaction of SubPc-Cl with phenols, in this one-step reaction a bimolecular four-centered transition state is formed, in which the electrophilic TMS functionality plays the role of the phenol proton assisting B–Cl bond dissociation through coordination of the halophilic Si center to the leaving chlorine atom concomitantly with the formation of the new B–Nu bond. As a result, a concerted rupture of the B–Cl and Si–O bonds and formation of the B–O and Si–Cl bonds is observed. Surprisingly, in the case of TMS-protected phenol, DFT calculations revealed an activation barrier higher than in the presence of the unprotected alcohol. Such a finding can be rationalized on the basis of the steric hindrance of the TMS moiety and is responsible for the smaller reaction rates observed in axial substitution reactions with TMS-protected phenol derivatives. On the other hand, in the case of aliphatic alcohols no reaction and/or decomposition or the macrocycle was observed.
 Scheme 7  Reaction between SubPc-Cl derivatives and TMS-nucleophiles to afford axially substituted SubPcs.85 
Several dimeric, oligomeric and polymeric systems such as the representative examples shown in Fig. 9 have been prepared by exploiting the axial ligand exchange reaction of SubPc-Cl with aryl alcohols featuring more than one OH group or with moieties bearing several phenolic functionalities. The synthetic strategies employed for their preparation as well as the main spectroscopic features of these derivatives will be discussed in Section 2.5.2.
 Fig. 9  Chemical structure of the SubPc-based systems 24–30 investigated by Shibata and co-workers. 
When the aryl alcohol is linked to a chromophoric unit – such as a BODIPY,98 an azaBODIPY,99,109 a perylenediimide,124 a Ps,14,125,126 a Pcs,76 a pentacene dimer,82 a diazobenzene24,127 or a dithienylethene moiety22 – a multicomponent system is obtained upon axial substitution of the SubPc moiety (see Section 2.6).
Axial substitution in SubPc dimers,128 SubPc fused dimers,48 as well as in SubPc-containing fused hybrid systems129 is realized under similar conditions to that employed in monomeric SubPcs.
Despite the higher reactivity of SubPc-Br precursors in axial ligand exchange reactions,123 axial substitution with aryl alcohols from axially brominated SubPcs is much less common than from chlorinated SubPc species, due to the drawbacks associated with the lower stability of the B–Br bond such as the formation of hydrolyzed SubPc species.96,111,121,122,130–133
Axial ligand exchange with alkyl alcohols proceeds in general less efficiently than with phenols due to the lower acidity of the hydroxylic proton, in line with the postulated mechanism for axial substitution proposed by Coral, González Rodríguez and co-workers.123
Substitution of the axial chlorine ligand in the presence of alkyl alcohols is normally carried out in boiling toluene, with reaction times varying from 24 and 72 hours.134–140 The use of higher boiling solvents such as o-DCB15 or the addition of a base to neutralize the generated HCl (e.g. K2CO3),136 have also been reported.
Surprisingly, axially 4-bromobutoxy-substituted SubPc has been detected as by-product in the reaction of H12SubPc-Br with aryl Grignard reagents in refluxing THF, as a result of the ring opening of the solvent.141 Such kind of reactivity was further investigated by Bender and co-workers extending the scope to different cyclic ether solvents bearing endocyclic C–O bonds.142 As a matter of fact, cleavage of one of the endocyclic C–O bond of the solvent and subsequent addition to the SubPc unit to afford the corresponding ring opened products 32–34 was observed in the presence of THF, 1,4-dioxane and γ-butyrolactone (Scheme 8). A σ-bond metathesis mechanism was proposed for this reaction, in line with the findings of the group of Torres.123 It is interesting to observe that in THF, C–O bond cleavage is not observed in absence of the Grignard reagent. On the other hand, in the presence of acyclic ethers (e.g. diethyl ether) or cyclic solvents featuring different heteroatoms (e.g. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, morpholine) no conversion, partial hydrolysis or decomposition of the macrocycle was observed.
 Scheme 8  Reaction of SubPc-Br with solvents bearing an endocyclic C–O bond to yield ring opened products.141,142 
Replacement of the apical bromine atom with 4-hydroxy-TEMPO has been exploited to prepare the SubPc precursor for the selective functionalization of polystyrene and poly (n-butyl acrylate) ω-chain end (see Section 2.5.2.4 for further details).143,144 Reaction of SubPc-Br with carboxylic acid functionalities has also been employed by Bender and co-workers for the preparation of SubPc-containing polymers upon refluxing of the SubPc and the polymeric material in high boiling solvents.145
Axial substitution with polar aprotic solvents was investigated by Bender after detecting the formation of formate-substituted SubPc as by-product in the reaction of SubPc-Br with phenol in DMF.121 As a matter of fact, upon heating the brominated SubPc precursor at 100 °C in the presence of dimethyl amide-containing solvents such as DMF and DMAc, the formation of the corresponding SubPc-formate and SubPc-acetate derivatives (35 and 36) was observed (Scheme 9). Axial substitution with DMF and DMAc was found to occur also from the axially chloro-substituted and mesylate-substituted derivative, even if in smaller amount due to the lower reactivity of these precursors with respect to SubPc-Br. On the other hand, the attempts of axial substitution reaction in non-amide containing solvents such as acetone and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone led to the hydrolysis or the degradation of the SubPc precursor, respectively.
 Scheme 9  Reaction of SubPc-Br with DMF and DMAc to yield formate- and acetate-substituted SubPcs.121 
SubPc-OH species have been synthesized upon heating under reflux a suspension of the starting axially halogenated SubPc in water,146 pyridine/water,147 DMSO/pyridine/water,130,148 acetonitrile/water149 or acetone/water121 mixtures. A silanoxy SubPc derivative was prepared by Bender and co-workers from the hydroxy-substituted precursor upon reaction with the corresponding chlorosilane in o-DCB.150 μ-Oxo SubPc homo- and heterodimers have been prepared by self-condensation of SubPc-OH derivatives or through reaction of SubPc-OH derivatives with axially halogenated SubPcs (for further details see Section 2.5.2.1).151–153
2.2.1.2 Formation of B–N bonds. 
The introduction of N-based ligand at the apical position of the SubPcs macrocycle is commonly accomplished through activation of the SubPc precursor (vide supra).65,68 As an exception, the direct reaction of phthalimides with SubPc-Cl in refluxing dichlorobenzene for prolonged reaction times (i.e. 90–100 hours) was reported in 2011 by Bender and co-workers.154 Recently, García and co-workers reported the formation of B–N bonds between encapsulated SubPcs and the amino functionalities of the host MIL-101(Cr)-NH2 metal–organic framework (MOF) upon refluxing the suspension containing the active MOF and the SubPc-Cl precursor in toluene during 48 hours.155 A novel SubPc-azido derivative was obtained from the reaction of a SubPc-Cl precursor with Me3SiN3 in refluxing toluene.85 Surprisingly, the product turned out to be perfectly stable, even if the reactivity of the axial azido group was found to be different from the expected probably due to the electronic and steric influence of the SubPc macrocycle.
2.2.1.3 Formation of B–C bonds. 
Formation of B–C bonds has been also widely employed as a strategy for the axial derivatization of SubPc chromophores. A common approach for the introduction of ethynyl functionalities in the axial position of the macrocycle involves the reaction of a SubPc-Cl precursor with a Grignard reagent which is formed in situ upon treatment of a terminal alkyne with EtMgBr, as reported in the pivotal works of Ziessel and co-workers (Scheme 10).156 In this protocol, both the formation of the Grignard derivative of the acetylenic precursor and the replacement of the axial chloride ligand are carried out in THF at 60 °C. By reacting their Grignard-derivatives with axially chlorinated SubPcs, ethynyl-ferrocene,88 ethynyl-aniline43,46 and ethynyl-pyrene157 moieties have been successfully introduced at the apical position of the macrocycle. For the introduction of ethynyl-ferrocene, the reaction with the starting SubPc-Cl was carried out at room temperature.88
 Scheme 10  Preparation of ethynylaryl-substituted SubPcs from reaction of SubPc-Cl and Grignard reagents.156 
The direct synthesis of a SubPc–Fc dyad featuring a direct bond between the boron and a carbon atom of one of the two cyclopentadienyl rings has also reported.88 In this case, the chloro precursor was reacted at room temperature with ferrocenyl lithium, which was prepared by treatment of bromoferrocene with BuLi in THF at −78 °C.
The synthesis of aryl-functionalized SubPcs by axial substitution reaction of the precursor SubPc-Br with aryl moieties bearing a hydrogen, methyl, methoxy, phenyl or fluoro substituent at the para position of the ring was reported in 2015 by Bender and co-workers.141 In this work, the replacement of the axial bromine atom was carried out upon refluxing in THF the SubPc precursor with aryl magnesium bromide reagents. The formation of SubPc-4-bromobutoxy as side product was proposed as a rationale for the low yields observed in these reaction, and was deemed to prevent the formation of the target products in the presence of tri- and penta-fluorinated aryl precursors.
Remarkably, a nitrile functionality could be introduced for the first time at the axial position of the SubPc macrocycle through reaction of axially chlorinated SubPcs with Me3SiCN, as reported by Guilleme et al.85 On the other hand, reaction of SubPc-Cl precursors with the TMS derivatives of other carbon nucleophiles following the same procedure was found to led to the decomposition of the macrocycle. Recently, the formation of a SubPc-CN derivative upon reaction of SubPc-Cl with cyanide in the presence of cryptand[2.2.2] has also been inferred.158
2.2.1.4 Formation of B–F, B–Cl and B–Br bonds. 
The formation of boron-halogen bonds through ligand exchange from a different halogenated SubPc derivative or by axial substitution of SubPc-OAr precursors constitutes another common reaction of SubPcs. Axially fluorinated SubPcs have been prepared from the corresponding SubPc-Cl, SubPc-Br and SubPc-OAr precursors by treatment with a large excess of BF3·OEt2.49,65,102,159,160 SubPc-F derivatives can also be prepared from the chlorinated precursors in the presence of AgBF4.13 On the other hand, chloro-substituted SubPcs have been obtained from SubPc-OH, SubPc-OPh or SubPc-Br derivatives in the presence of BCl3, AlCl366 or p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (TsCl).161
Unexpected axial halide exchange reactions have been observed during SubPcs synthesis by Bender and co-workers.30,32 In the attempt to synthetize Cl6SubPc-Br from 4,5-dichlorophthalonitrile in the presence of BBr3, the concomitant formation of the axially chlorinated conjugate was observed (Scheme 2).30 The authors suggested the solvent rather than the phthalonitrile precursor as the source of chloride, as no peripherally brominated products were detected. A similar halogen exchange was observed a few years later during the synthesis of F6SubPc-Cl and F12SubPc-Cl from 4,5-difluorophthalonitrile and 3,4,5,6-tetrafluorophthalonitrile in the presence of BCl3.32 In this case, a mixture of axially fluorinated and chlorinated SubPcs was obtained (Scheme 3). The degradation of the precursor phthalonitrile was inferred as a rationale for this experimental finding. The reaction of the resulting SubPcs mixture with BF3·OEt2 by the established halide exchange protocol,65 which involves the use of 25 equiv. of boron halide, did not afford a solid product. Instead, completion of the fluoride exchange was accomplished by diminishing the equivalents of BF3·Et2O to 10. For what concerns work-up procedures, short-path distillation of the excess of boron reagent was found to be the best method to obtain SubPc-F derivatives in high yield and purity.32
2.2.1.5 Formation of B–H bonds. 
The preparation of SubPc-hydride derivatives has been recently accomplished by Torres, Martínez-Díaz and co-workers.162 Such derivatives were prepared employing DIBAL-H as hydride donor which, due to its empty π-orbital, is able to coordinate the apical chlorine atom thus assisting the axial exchange. Importantly, these derivatives were found to be effective reagents for the hydroboration of aldehydes in the presence of catalytic amounts of a carbonyl activator (e.g., TMSOTf) or a hydride scavenger (e.g., Ph3C[B(C6F5)4]).
2.2.1.6 Formation of B–B bonds. 
The only example of B–B bond formation in SubPcs was reported by Torres and co-workers in 2007 and consists in the preparation of a SubPc dimer via reductive Wurtz coupling of SubPc-Cl.163
2.2.1.7 Reactions on the axial substituent not involving the B–Y bond. 
Besides reactions of axial substitution at the boron atom, another class of reactions can be distinguished which result in the chemical modification of the axial substituent but not involve the apical B–Y linkage. While the former are specific of SubPc chemistry, the latter are conventional reactions. Hereafter, an overview of the reaction on the axial substituents not involving the B–Y bond is reported.
The reaction between SubPcs bearing axial hydroquinone and phloroglucinol functionalities with SubPc-Cl precursors94 or the corresponding activated triflate derivatives70,73 has been exploited for the preparation of dimeric or trimeric SubPc species (25–30, Fig. 9). Axial alkyl alcohol substituents have been employed to replace the axial chlorine atom in SubPc-Cl derivatives leading to the formation of SubPc-stoppered rotaxanes, even if in very low yields.79 Axially hydroquinone-substituted SubPcs have also been employed in nucleophilic substitution reactions.108 Prato reaction involving the axial hydroxybenzaldehyde group of SubPc precursors89,93,104,105,107,164–166 constitute a common approach for the obtention of fullerene-containing multicomponent systems based on SubPcs. Treatment with sodium chlorite in the presence of sulfamic acid as hypochlorite scavenger has been employed for the oxidation of the axial hydroxybenzaldehyde group to the carboxyl derivative.47,117 Reduction of the axial nitrophenoxy group with molecular hydrogen,97,100 alkylation of the axial aminophenoxy ligand with propanesultone to afford the corresponding alkylsulfonate species97 and quaternization of tertiary amines in the axial moiety with methyl iodide134 have also been reported, as well as acylation with protected acids using EDC and NHS as coupling agents100 or reaction with succinic anhydride.108 The amino functionality of the apical aminophenoxy group has been used as nucleophile with triflate-activated SubPcs to form nitrogen-bridged SubPc dimers.74 Reaction of SubPc-TEMPO at the ω-chain end of polystyrene and poly(n-butyl acrylate) produced by nitroxide mediate polymerization has also been performed.143 Upon probing nucleophilic addition or hydrolysis of the axial cyano functionality as well as reduction of either cyano or azide moieties directly linked to the boron atom of SubPcs no reaction or decomposition of the macrocycle have been observed.85 Copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactions (CuAAC) have been carried out from axially azido-substituted SubPcs85,138 and ethynyl-substituted SubPcs.72,136,138–140,167,168 SubPcs with terminal alkyne substituent have been employed in Pd-catalyzed oxidative Glaser–Hay coupling,72,75,138 modified Cadiot–Chodkiewicz coupling72,75,90 and Sonogashira coupling57,58,72,75,90 reactions. Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions from the apical bromophenoxy group169 and Suzuki cross-coupling either from iodophenoxy or borylated phenylacetylene with boronic acid and halogenated derivatives170,171 have also been carried out. Recently, cycloadditon–retroelectrocyclization (CA–RE) reaction of axial ethynyl-aniline,43,46 ethynylferrocene and butadyineferrocene56 ligands with tetracyanoethylene to afford TCBD–aniline (10 and 11, Fig. 6), TCBD–ferrocene and ethynyl–TCBD–ferrocene SubPc derivatives have been reported by the groups of Torres and Nielsen.


2.2.2 Peripheral reactivity. 
Unlike axial substituents, which usually have no or very little impact on the electronic characteristics of the SubPc macrocycle, peripheral substituents can produce strong perturbations on the system which are reflected on the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of SubPc derivatives. The harsh conditions required for SubPc synthesis limit the functional groups that can be introduced in the starting phthalonitrile, since many functionalities are incompatible with the boron reagents employed. As a matter of fact, the peripheral groups that can be introduced directly through SubPc synthesis are restricted to halogen atoms, nitro groups, amines, alkyl groups, ethers, thioethers or sulphones. For this reason, chemical modification of the peripheral substituent of the SubPc preformed ring is of paramount importance.
Whereas axial ligand exchange reactions are exclusive of SubPc chemistry, peripheral reactivity involves common organic reactions. Anyway, it is worth to mention that due to the chemical instability of SubPcs, the experimental conditions need to be carefully selected in order to prevent the decomposition of the SubPc macrocycle. As a matter of fact, in presence of strong nucleophile the macrocyclic ring is often destroyed.
Several protocols have been employed for the derivatization of the SubPc peripheral benzene rings including metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions (i.e. Sonogashira, Suzuki, Stille, Hartwig–Buchwald and borylation reactions), alkylation of pyridine groups, acylation of hydroxy derivatives, deprotection reactions of ester and ether functionalities, oxidation of sulfides, reduction of triple bonds, and cyclopropanation reactions to link fullerene moieties, which have been previously reviewed from some of us.1 Here, the publications dealing with SubPc peripheral reactivity which are subsequent to our previous review on contracted poprhyrinoids1 are summarized.11 Sonogashira coupling reactions of peripherally iodo-substituted SubPc precursors in the presence of ethynyl-pyridine,92 propargylic acid,47 ethynyl-benzoic acid,47,50 4-(7-ethynyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4-yl) ethynyl-benzoic acid,55 tris(dodecyloxy)phenylacetylene,102 ethynyl-thiophene derivatives,171 ethynyltrimethylsilane and (triisopropylsilyl)acetylene,75 a tetraethynylethene derivative,53 1,2-diethynyl benzene,172 ethynyl-N,N-dimethylaniline,46,55 trimethylsilyl-protected ethynylferrocene and butadyineferrocene,56 ethynyl perylenediimide precursors,173 ethynylated dihydroazulene,57 and a bis(ethynyl)boron-functionalized SubPc dimer58 have been reported, as well as the coupling between 1,4-diethynyl benzene and the peripherally bromo-substituted SubPc precursors.169 Suzuki reactions of pyreneboronic acid and phenylboronic acid tethered pyrene with iodophenoxy-SubPcs,164 of ferroceneboronic acid111 and aminophenylboronic acid pinacol ester174 with iodo-SubPcs, of thiophene boronic acid pinacol ester derivatives with bromo-SubPcs,116 and of bromo terpyridine with borylated SubPc species15 have also been published. Other publications reported the Heck coupling between vinyl-pyridine and iodo-substituted SubPc precursors,118 the Stille coupling between trimethyl (4-pyridyl) tin and iodo-SubPc derivatives,113 the Hartwig–Buchwald reaction of tri(dodecyloxy)benzamide with iodo-substituted SubPc precursors37 and of phenothiazine with iodophenoxy-93 and iodo-substituted SubPc species.104 Borylation reaction of iodo-SubPcs with bis(pinacolato)diboron15 and Knoevenagel condensation on thiophene-carbaldehyde substituted SubPcs116 have also been reported.
Despite the sensitiveness of SubPcs to the cyanide anion, an efficient method for the preparation of peripherally cyano-substituted SubPcs (37–47, Fig. 10) from the corresponding iodo-precursors based on a mild palladium-mediated coupling reaction in DMF in the presence of zinc cyanide has been reported by the group of Torres.48,49,54 In this approach, microwave irradiation was found to be fundamental to obtain a complete conversion in short reaction times, limiting SubPc decomposition. Cyanation of peripherally hydrogenated SubPcs or SubPc functionalized with peripheral electron-rich groups was found to provide better yields than cyanation of SubPcs bearing peripheral electron-withdrawing substituents. This behaviour was attributed to the ring-opening side reaction of the SubPc macrocycle subsequent to the nucleophilic attack of the cyanide anion on SubPcs substituted with electron-poor groups.54

Methylation of pyridine118 and sulfides18 with methyl iodine have been employed for the preparation of cationic SubPcs. Cycloaddition–retroelectrocyclization (CA–RE) reaction with tetracyanoethylene of ethynyl-aniline SubPc precursors to obtain the corresponding TCBD–aniline derivatives (10 and 11, Fig. 6)46,55 and of ethynylferrocene- and butadiyneferrocene-substituted precursors to form the corresponding TCBD–ferrocene and aniline-TCBD–ferrocene conjugates56 have been recently exploited by the groups of Torres and Nielsen. Deprotection of silyl ether groups in the presence of CsF in acetone and subsequent reaction of the hydroxy-substituted SubPc with 1,4-benzene diboronic acid have also been reported.120


2.2.3 Ring-expansion reactions. 
The preparation of unsymmetrically substituted Pcs via ring-opening reaction of SubPc derivatives was first reported by Kobayashi et al. in 1990 (Scheme 11).175 In the attempt to synthesize a SubPc derivative according to the procedure published by Meller and Ossko,10 the authors decided to trace the reaction and found that it always yielded a blue compound as byproduct, which was later identified as a Pc. This work triggered the interest of the porphyrinoids community on the chemistry of the three-isoindole-based SubPc macrocycle, constituting the practical start of subporphyrinoids chemistry.
 Scheme 11  General reaction scheme for ring-expansion reactions. 
Many efforts have been dedicated to the study of this type of reactivity after its discovery. As a result, different reaction conditions (e.g. the nature of the SubPc and the diiminoisoindoline/phthalonitrile precursors, solvent and temperature) have been explored, and the factors affecting the efficiency of the reaction have been identified.1 Although the use of SubPcs as building blocks for the synthesis of non-symmetrical Pcs has constituted during several years the main application of these contracted macrocycles, during the last couple of decades the attention toward this class of reactions have diminished substantially. However, a few reports on SubPc ring-expansion reactions have been published during the last years.11,176 In 2015, the first chiral unsymmetrical Pc prepared through SubPc ring-expansion reaction was synthetized via reaction of achiral H12SubPc-OPh and an optically active binaphthyl-functionalized diiminoisoindoline.177 In the same year, novel Pcs bearing six aryl-thioether groups were prepared from ring-expansion reaction of peripherally-substituted SubPcs and diiminoisoindoline.16 Pcs functionalized with aryl alcohols were also prepared from unsubstituted SubPc-Cl and the corresponding phthalonitrile precursors.28

2.3 Characterization of subphthalocyanines

2.3.1 Single-crystal X-ray diffraction. 
In contrast to Pcs, which are characterized by a flat or nearly flat structure, SubPcs feature a non-planar, cone-shaped geometry, as confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The nature of the axial and peripheral substituents does not practically affect the position of the nitrogen and carbon atoms of the ring, with the exception of slight variations of the bond lengths and bond angles at the level of the Y(Ni)3 tetrahedron, where Y indicates the apical ligand and Ni refers to the isoindolic nitrogen atoms.1 As a general trend, the B–Y bond length increases descending along the halogen series, while it does not practically depend on the peripheral substitution pattern of the macrocycle. The bond angles involving the central boron atom, which are slightly deformed with respect to that of an ideal tetrahedron, also feature small variations upon varying the nature of the axial ligand.
A comprehensive study of the crystal structures of axially and peripherally halogenated SubPcs has been reported in 2014 by Bender and co-workers.30 As expected, the axial B–Y bond length was found to be almost independent on the nature of the peripheral substituents, while it was observed to be greater in the axially brominated derivatives with respect to their chlorinated analogues. The axial B–O bond length in SubPcs axially substituted with a pentafluorophenoxy ligand also showed minimal variations upon modification of the peripheral substituents. In all the investigated structures, the distances between the boron atom and the planes defined by the inner N atoms and the outer N atoms showed negligible variations. On the other hand, the distance between the boron atom and the plane of the six outer C atoms showed higher perturbations. This evidence was ascribed to π–π and halogen–π interactions in the crystal systems. A similar effect was observed in SubPcs axially functionalized with hydroxy-phenoxy moieties, in which distorted B–O–C angles were detected as a consequence of H-bonding interactions.130 The sensitiveness to strong intermolecular interactions of the angle between the apical phenoxy ligand relative and the SubPc macrocycle had previously been observed in the presence of strong halogen bonds.178
In 2016, Bender and co-workers redetermined the crystal structure of the prototypical H12SubPc-Cl derivative 20, which was originally obtained by solvent crystallization methods,179 using crystals grown through slow train sublimation at different temperatures.180 The use of an improved train sublimation apparatus enabling low temperature ramping rates allowed to obtain relatively large (i.e. up to 0.8 mm) and high-quality single crystals. Moreover, the exploitation of the train sublimation technique for the obtention of crystal is of particular interest in view of the potential applications of SubPcs as molecular materials, as it well approximates the vacuum deposition conditions normally employed for the preparation of organic electronic devices. The obtained results confirmed that previously obtained by solution-growth methods,179,181 although the precision of the geometric parameters was significantly improved, and lower R values were determined. In particular, intramolecular metrics were found to be highly consistent with the reported data. The small differences in the unit-cell parameters were therefore ascribed to differences in the intermolecular distances.
The structural parameters of a series of SubPc X-ray structures have been previously reviewed by some of us.1 Several novel crystal structures of SubPc derivatives have been published since then, which are reported in ref. 17, 19, 30, 32, 43, 56, 57, 79, 85–88, 91, 96, 97, 108, 111, 114, 121, 130, 132, 141, 143, 145, 165, 172, 180 and 182–185. Selected data from X-ray diffraction analysis of some of these crystal structures are reported in Table 1. Among them, it is worth to mention that of perfluorinated and perhydrogenated SubPc-OTf derivatives 14 and 54 (Scheme 5), which constitute strategic activated species in axial substitution reactions (see Section 2.2.1).85,86 In 2017, the resolution of the crystal structure of isolated enantiomers of H12SubPc and F12SubPc species functionalized at the apical position of the macrocycle with an axially chiral TCBD–aniline moiety (10 and 11, Fig. 6) was reported by Torres and co-workers.43 Remarkably, the X-ray crystal structure of a SubPc cation having a weakly coordinating carborane anion has also been reported, showing the tendency of the central boron to adopt a planar geometry, as expected for a tricoordinated B atom.186 The crystal structures of some covalently linked SubPc dimers72,75,79,127,128,151,185 and fused SubPc-containing hybrid dimers129,187,188 have also been reported.

A detailed description of the solid-state arrangement of SubPc derivatives is reported in Section 2.4.1.


2.3.2 Mass spectrometry. 
SubPcs generally afford very clean mass spectra in which the major peak corresponds to the molecular ion. The peak originating from the loss of the axial ligand is also quite commonly observed.


2.3.3 NMR spectroscopy. 
Unlike Pcs, which 1H-NMR spectra are generally broad due to aggregation issues, SubPcs do not tend to form aggregates in solution. Therefore, their 1H-NMR spectra are usually characterized by sharp peaks which chemical shifts do not depend on the concentration of the sample. Due to the diatropic ring current generated by the 14 π-electron aromatic system, the signals of the protons of the isoindolic benzene rings appear at low fields (generally between 7.8 and 9.9 ppm), while the signals of the protons of the axial substituent are shifted upfield with respect to that of the corresponding free ligand. As an example, the axial phenyl group in H12SubPc–Ph gives rise to three signals at 6.63, 6.51 and 5.37 ppm, being the latter the one corresponding to the closest proton to the SubPc core, whereas the signals of the ortho and meta protons of the macrocyclic framework appear at 8.78–8.76 and 7.81–7.79 ppm, respectively.68 The axial hydroxy substituent yields a broad signal at −0.58 ppm, while a methoxy group linked to the boron atom gives a signal at 1.50 ppm.68
The effect of the diatropic ring current of the macrocycle on the ring substituents allows to differentiate the signals of the protons located “inside” or “outside” the bowl-shaped SubPc framework. For peripherally binaphthyloxy-substituted SubPc 9 (Fig. 5) two sets of peaks were observed for the protons of the ring substituents, as a consequence of the location of the naphthalene rings at both the endo and the exo sides of the macrocycle.20 A similar effect was detected in the low-temperature NMR spectrum of a SubPc peripherally substituted with six 2′,6′-di-iso-propylphenoxy moieties.19 In the case of SubPc π-complexes featuring a Cp*Ru+ unit coordinated to either the concave or the convex face of the macrocycle (63–66, Fig. 12), a notable diatropic effect on the Cp* moiety was observed in the case of the endo-coordinated compound, while an exceptionally small shift was detected for the exo-coordinated complex.63
Peripheral substituents influence the chemical shifts of the isoindolic benzene protons in a predictable way, according to their electronic nature. On the contrary, the effect of the axial ligand is not as clear, although differences in the chemical shifts of the isoindolic protons of SubPcs axially substituted with different moieties suggest the existence of a communication between the aromatic macrocycle and the axial substituent.68 As a matter of fact, the chemical shifts of the aromatic protons of the SubPc macrocycle follow the order δH (YB = Br) > δH (YB = O) > δH (YB = Cl), where represents the atom of the axial substituent directly linked to the boron atom. Notably, the variation of the axial ligand from an alkoxy (YB = O) to a thioalkoxy (YB = S) or an amino (YB = N) moiety does not influence in an appreciable way the chemical shift of the peaks corresponding to the benzo protons.68 Upon addition of acids, a downfield shift of the signals corresponding to the SubPc benzene rings was reported by Decréau and co-workers.67 The protonation of the azomethine bridges was proposed as a possible rationale, although peaks corresponding to iminium-like protonated bridges were not identified.
The central boron generally gives rise to a sharp singlet located between −13 and −20 ppm in the corresponding 11B–NMR spectra, in accordance with the expected chemical shift for a tetrasubstituted boron atom. In the 11B–NMR spectra of SubPcs axially substituted with a fluorine atom, a doublet (J ≈ 30 Hz) is observed as a consequence of the B–F coupling.159 Both peripheral and axial substituents have an appreciable influence on the chemical shift of the peak corresponding to the boron atom. As an example, in the peripherally perfluorinated SubPc-Cl derivative the boron signal is upfield by approximately 0.4 ppm with respect to the corresponding hydrogenated analogue.159 Regarding axial substitution, the boron signal appears at 13.3, −13.8, −14.3, −15.1 and −15.1 ppm, respectively, in thio-, chloro-, fluoro-, aryloxy- and amino-substituted SubPcs.68,159 Although the origin of these small variations is not clear, the trend reflects the different extent of π back-donation from the axial ligand to the boron atom. In SubPcs featuring a B–C bond, the boron signal is generally located between −15 and −18 ppm.68,156 In particular, the chemical shift is related to the hybridation of the carbon linked to the boron atom, being the order δ (Csp3) > δ (Csp2) > δ (Csp).68
In 19F-NMR spectra of SubPc-F derivatives, a quartet centered between −160 and −155 ppm is originated by the axial fluorine substituent due to the coupling with the boron atom.49,67,102,159


2.3.4 IR spectroscopy. 
Infrared (IR) spectra of SubPcs are dominated by the bands arising from the bending and the stretching of the C–C and the C–N bonds of the macrocycle. The assignation of the stretching band corresponding to the B–Y bond was first made possible by substituting the central boron atom with the 10B isotope and monitoring the changes in the IR spectra.189 For SubPcs bearing an axial halogen atom, a decrease of the B–Y stretching wavenumber is observed descending along the series, along with the decreasing electronegativity of the substituent. Values of 1063, 960 and 622 cm−1 were reported, respectively, for the B–F, B–Cl and B–Br stretching in peripherally perhydrogenated SubPc derivatives. Concerning SubPcs axially substituted with alkyloxy or aryloxy ligands, the B–O stretching originates a band at 1119 cm−1 for Y = OtBu, 1107 cm−1 for Y = OiPr, 1052 cm−1 for Y = OPh and 1067 cm−1 for Y = O-p-C6H4–OH in the corresponding H12-SubPc species. In the presence of a thiophenoxy axial substituent, a band at 962 cm−1 is observed for the B–S stretching. Such a decrease (90 cm−1) in the B–Y stretching wavelength when shifting from oxygen to sulfur is in line with the trend observed within the halogen series. On the other hand, in the presence of axial amino substituents, B–N stretching bands between 1060 and 1107 cm−1 could be observed.68 In the infrared spectrum of the H12SubPc derivative axially substituted with an acetate group (Y = OCOCH3), bands at 1702 and 1277 cm−1 were found for the ν(C–O) and the ν(CO) stretching, respectively.189 The difference between ν(CO) and ν(C–O) wavenumbers is in line with the monodentate ligand character of the apical substituent.189 In the presence of TFA and its deuterated analogue, new features were observed in the IR of SubPc-Cl derivatives (i.e. H12SubPc-Cl and (NO2)3SubPc-Cl). The appearance of the N–H and N–D stretching bands of the iminium species formed upon protonation and deuteration of the SubPc azomethine bridges was suggested by the authors as a possible rationale for this experimental finding.67


2.3.5 UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. 
The absorption spectra of SubPcs are dominated by two intense bands in the 260–370 nm region and the 460–580 nm region. The absorption at lower wavelengths (i.e. Soret band or B band) originates from the S0 → S2 transition, while the absorption at higher wavelengths (i.e. Q band) is attributable to the S0 → S1 transition. Shoulders of the Q band associated to vibronic transitions are also commonly observed. Although the overall shape of the UV-vis spectra of SubPcs is similar to that of Pc derivatives, both the B and the Q band are blue-shifted with respect to the corresponding Pc transitions as a consequence of the smaller π-conjugated system (i.e. 14 π-electrons in SubPcs vs. 18 π-electrons in Pcs). The molar extinction coefficients (ε) of the main bands are lower for SubPc than for Pcs, being the ε value of the SubPc Q band of the order of 5–6 × 104 dm3 mol−1 cm−1. Such a difference in the absorption coefficient of the Q band could be related to the non-planar geometry of the SubPc macrocycle. With some exceptions,37,38 concentration effects on the position and shape of the absorption bands are commonly absent, confirming the low tendency of SubPcs towards aggregation in solution. The effect of SubPc substituents on the absorption characteristics of these macrocycles greatly depends on the functionalization site. A review on the impact of the macrocycle functionalization pattern on the optical properties of SubPcs has been recently reported by Dowds and Nielsen.62 In general, axial ligands do not affect or have a very small effect on the absorption maxima (see for example ref. 1, 32, 110, 122, 132 and 141). On the other hand, peripheral substituents have appreciable effects on the position of the absorption bands. As a matter of fact, in the presence of both electron-donor (see for example ref. 16, 19, 20, 23, 35, 46, 47, 50, 51, 55, 105 and 118) and electron-withdrawing (see for example ref. 29, 32, 50, 52, 80, 114 and 122) peripheral substituents able to slightly extend the π-conjugation of the macrocycle, the Q band is commonly shifted to higher wavelengths with respect to the perhydrogenated SubPc derivative. When the macrocycle is substituted with π-donor atoms (e.g. oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur), as in the case of ether-, amino- or thioether-substituted SubPcs, this effect is generally stronger. In this case, the shift to the red of the Q band increases with the π-donating characteristics of the atom linked to the macrocycle and the number of π-donor peripheral substituents. Furthermore, in the presence of alkoxy, sulfonyl, thioether or amino substituents, additional bands in the 400–500 nm region originating from n → π transitions are observed. A red shift of the Q band is observed also in SubPc analogues (e.g. SubNcs) characterized by an extended conjugated system and in SubPc fused dimers (see Sections 2.5.1 and 4.2).
An extraordinarily red-shifted absorption (Δλ = 87–94 nm with respect to H12SubPc-Cl) was reported by Bender and co-workers for SubPcs substituted with six catechol moieties (e.g.51, Fig. 11), which was rationalized by the authors as the result of the formation of an extended pseudo-π-electron system, rather than as simple substitution effect.17 Recently, the effect of peripheral cyano groups on the absorption characteristics of SubPcs has been investigated by Martínez Díaz, Seki, Cheyns, Torres and co-workers.48,49,54 Intriguingly, the electronic properties of the SubPc macrocycle were found to depend on the number and relative position of the cyano substituents. As a matter of fact, in unsymmetrical ortho-dicyano and bis-ortho-dicyano SubPcs 37–46 (Fig. 10) a remarkable bathochromic shift (15–29 nm) of the absorption maxima was observed along with an increase of the extinction coefficients (with values in the order of 8–10 × 104 dm3 mol−1 cm−1) in comparison with the precursor halogenated derivatives. These variations can be rationalized of the basis of the extension of the π-conjugation of the system. Surprisingly, the UV-vis spectrum of symmetrical tricyano-SubPc 47 does not present any change in the position of the absorption maxima with respect to the halogenated precursor, although higher ε values can be observed.

 Fig. 12  Chemical structure of SubPc π-complexes 63–66 reported by Sessler, Guldi, Torres and co-workers.63 
In the presence of organic acids, a new high-wavelength absorption bands can be observed in the UV-vis spectra of SubPc derivatives (e.g. at 610, 631 and 665 nm for H12SubPc-Cl) along with a decrease of the intensity of the SubPc Q absorption, probably as a consequence of the protonation of the azomethine bridges.64,67
In SubPc-based multicomponent systems, ligand-centered transitions or other photophysical events (e.g. ground-state charge transfer processes or other photophysical events (exciplex formation) can take place, leading to peculiar features in the absorption spectra of these conjugates. A detailed description of these systems is provided in Section 2.6.
In the solid state, similar absorption spectra are observed to those obtained in solution. In general, a redshift of the UV-vis maxima along with a broadening of the Q band in observed in SubPc films.25,71,101,110,116,118,173,190 The electroabsorption spectra of Pc-doped SubPcs in PMMA films have also been measured.191
Recently, the absorption properties of different SubPc light harvesters coupled to metallic optical cavities have also been investigated.192,193 In the case of a TCBD-substituted derivative, different coupling regimes of the two characteristic electronic transitions (i.e., the Q band transition and the CT transition) were observed as a direct consequence of their different oscillator strength, resulting in very different spectral and directional light-harvesting features.192


2.3.6 CD spectroscopy. 
Circular dichroism (CD) measurements of enantiopure SubPc derivatives have also been reported. In 2002, Kobayashi and co-workers published the first CD spectra of enantiomerically pure SubPcs.31 In the investigated C3-symmetric derivatives, peripheral substitution with nitro and t-butyl groups was aimed to increase the intensity of the CD signal and the solubility of the compounds, respectively. In 2003, the synthesis of an optically active SubPc dimer featuring a chiral (R)-(+)-BINOL moiety as linker (8, Fig. 5) was presented.41 CD measurements on this derivative evidenced an induced CD on the SubPc by the binaphthyl unit. Similarly, in the CD spectra of a couple of chiral SubPcs bearing three peripheral (R)-2,2′-binaphthyloxy and (S)-2,2′-binaphthyloxy moieties, respectively (9R/S, Fig. 5), the detected signals in the 260–600 nm region were attributed to induced CD generated by the chiral ligands.20 In 2011, the correlation between CD spectra and absolute configuration was unambiguously established for the isolated enantiomers of a C3-symmetric and a C1-symmetric 1,2-SubNc derivatives (see Scheme 31 in Section 4.1) on the basis of single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.36
Recently, Torres and co-workers reported the synthesis and optical resolution of axially chiral SubPcs bearing a TCBD–aniline moiety at the apical position of the macrocycle (10 and 11, Fig. 6).43 As a consequence of the hindered rotation around the central C–C bond of the TCBD framework, these conjugates are formed as racemic mixtures of two enantiomers, which were separated by chiral HPLC. The CD spectra of the isolated atropisomers confirmed their enantiomeric relationship. The resolution of the single-crystal X-ray structure of the enantiopure species allowed to unambiguously correlate for the first time in SubPc-based and TCBD-based chemistry the CD spectra and absolute configuration of chiral SubPc derivatives. Moreover, CD measurements at different temperature over time in the presence or absence of stimuli (i.e. light, molecular oxygen) were performed on enantiopure samples of 10 and 11 in order to shed light on the racemization behavior of the investigated derivatives and determine the activation parameters for the racemization process.44 These studies, along with theoretical calculations, revealed a peculiar light-triggered enantiomer conversion mechanism enabled by triplet-state photogeneration, which can be rationalized on the basis of energetic, structural and kinetic considerations. The thermal configurational stability of the isolated enantiomers of 10 and 11 is in contrast with what reported in literature for a C60-TCBD–aniline analogue and what observed for a SubP derivative functionalized at the axial position with a TCBD–aniline unit, for which a thermally induced racemization was observed.45,194 As such, The peculiar racemization behavior of the investigated SubPc–TCBD–aniline derivatives render them intriguing photoresponsive systems for potential applications in the fast-growing field of light-controllable molecular switches.
Finally, CD measurements have also been employed to investigate the solution self-assembly of C3-symmetric SubPcs to form non-centrosymmetric columnar assemblies or dimeric structures.37,38 The results of these studies are discussed in detail in Section 2.4.4.1.


2.3.7 Excited states. 
Emission spectra of SubPcs are commonly the mirror image of the absorption Q-band. Low-symmetry substituted SubPcs, which usually present a split Q-band, may represent an exception to this rule.195,196 SubPc emission maxima are generally located between 570 and 620 nm, and are shifted accordingly to the absorption Q-band maxima as a function of the substitution pattern of the SubPc macrocycle.1 In general, very small Stoke shifts (around 10–15 nm) are observed, along with unusually narrow widths at half of the maximum intensity. Such spectral features suggest an only slight geometric distortion between the ground state and the singlet excited state as well as a narrow density of states of the HOMO and LUMO levels. Normally, modulation of solvent polarity does not lead to systematic changes in the position of the absorption and emission maxima, indicating a negligible variation of the dipole moment between the ground state and the singlet excited state. Singlet excited state energies of approximately 2.1–2.0 eV are generally calculated for SubPc derivatives from the intersection between the absorption Q band and the emission band, which are consistent with the HOMO–LUMO gaps calculated from cyclic voltammetry studies. Anyway, lower values have been observed in specific cases (e.g. in the presence of diphenylamino substituents).197 In general, these values are higher in comparison with those observed for Pcs (around 1.7 eV) and similar to those observed for porphyrins (approximately 2.0 eV). SubPcs are normally characterized by fluorescence quantum yields (φF) of 0.2–0.5, and fluorescence lifetimes (τs) of the order of a few nanometers, although higher φF values can be observed in some cases.1 In general, low φF values can be rationalized on the basis of fast intersystem crossing processes in heavy-atom containing SubPc derivatives or considering aggregation issues (e.g. in water). In addition, photoinduced energy transfer and electron transfer events in SubPc-based multicomponent systems can result in the quenching of the SubPc emission (refer to Section 2.6 for further details).
On the other hand, triplet excited state energies of approximately 1.45 eV are commonly calculated based on phosphorescence emission maxima, which are located in the near-infrared region. Thus, singlet–triplet energy gaps of around 0.65 eV are normally observed for SubPc derivatives, somewhat bigger than those calculated for phthalocyanines and porphyrins (0.5–0.6 eV and 0.6 eV, respectively).1 Phosphorescence emission of SubPcs can be enhanced adding a heavy atom provider (e.g. ethyl iodide) at low temperatures.195 Singlet oxygen measurements represent an alternative tool to indirectly estimate the lower limit for triplet quantum yields. A thoroughly study of the triplet excited state features of SubPcs based on time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance has also been published.198
Recently, aggregation induced emission enhancement has been observed in a SubPc derivative decorated at the axial position with a tetraphenylethylene moiety, which was ascribed to a fluorescence resonance energy transfer process from the excited apical moiety to the macrocyclic core (Fig. 13).119 On the other hand, the functionalization of the SubPc chromophore with tetraarylethylene unit at the periphery did not lead to any aggregation induced emission phenomenon.
 Fig. 13  Chemical structure of the tetraphenylethylene-substituted SubPcs investigated by Luo and co-workers.119 
The transient absorption characteristics of different SubPcs have also been reported (see for example ref. 1, 43, 46, 48, 58, 76, 78, 81, 88, 89, 92, 93, 99, 104, 105, 107, 109, 111, 126, 164–166, 170, 184, 188 and 199). In transient absorption spectra, singlet excited states of SubPcs are typically characterized by a strong bleaching in the Q band region and distinctive signatures in the 400–700 nm region. Decay dynamics are monoexponential, with rates on the order of 109 s−1. SubPcs triplet excited states also give rise to characteristic transient features. Besides through the formation of new features, intersystem crossing in SubPcs can also be monitored through the disappearance of the singlet signatures in the transient absorption spectra. In general, time constants for singlet decay and triplet growth processes are similar. Commonly, triplet lifetimes (τt) of approximately 80–150 μs are calculated from decay dynamics.
The absorption features of radical anion and cation SubPc species have also been studied by means of pulse radiolytic reduction and oxidation measurements, allowing for the assignation of the corresponding features in transient absorption measurements.43,165,166,197,200,201


2.3.8 Voltammetry. 
Both the first oxidative and reductive events of SubPcs are one electron processes. While reduction is often (quasi-)reversible on the cyclic voltammetry scale, oxidation gives rise to less stable species. Upon scanning at more positive or negative potentials, several redox events can typically be observed. These events, which in some cases are multi-electronic, are usually irreversible or quasi-reversible.197,200,202 Such irreversibility is generally ascribed to chemical transformations or deposition of the redox species on the electrodes. Electropolymerization on the working electrode has been reported for certain axially substituted SubPcs.135,137 A reversible oxidation has been reported for asymmetric SubPcs peripherally substituted with catechol moieties (Fig. 14).17 Moreover, two reversible reduction events were detected for some of these derivatives. The enhanced electrochemical stability of these compounds was explained on the basis of an increased delocalization of charge throughout a pseudo π-extended system or a partial charge separation between the oxygen-containing and the halogen-containing halves of the bowl, which was evidenced by DFT calculations.
 Fig. 14  Chemical structure of the asymmetric SubPc derivatives bearing peripheral catechol substituents investigated by Bender and co-workers.17 
For SubPc derivatives incorporating a carboxylic acid as peripheral substituent, a shoulder-like pre-peak was observed in the reduction scan at a relatively high SubPc concentration (0.5 mM), which was ascribed by the authors to a follow-up self-protonation reaction of the radical anion by the neutral substrate.55
The peripheral substitution pattern of the macrocycle influences the position of the SubPcs redox peaks in a predictable way. Generally, the first reductive event is observed between −1.58 and −0.82 V, while the first oxidative event is detected between +1.15 and 0.37 V employing Fc/Fc+ as internal ref. 197 and 200. A significantly low oxidation potential (0.10 V) has been observed in a hexaphenyl-substituted SubPc-Br derivative,23 probably as a consequence of the electron-donating features of the peripheral moieties, while a potential of 0.398 V was determined for a SubPc-OH bearing six peripheral alkyl chains.203,204 On the other hand, the nature of the axial ligand influences to a much lesser extent the values of the first oxidative and reductive half-wave potentials. Nevertheless, the axial substituent affects in a considerable way the reversibility of the redox events. As an example, in axially phenoxy-substituted SubPcs the reversibility of the redox processes is higher than in chloro-substituted SubPc, probably due to a better stabilization of the charged species in the former.200
An extensive study on the electrochemical properties of a series of SubPc derivatives with different axial and peripheral substituents has been recently reported by Bender, Kadish and co-workers.122 This work evidenced that the reversibility of the redox processes is influenced both by the nature of the axial and peripheral substituents and by the dipole moment of the boron-to-axial ligand bond. Two years later, the effect of fluorine versus chlorine as axial and/or peripheral substituents on the electrochemical properties of the SubPc macrocycle was investigated in detail by Bender, Gross and co-workers.205 This study pointed out that as a consequence of the stronger σ-withdrawing and π-donating effect of fluorides, the two halogens originate similar effects on the reduction potentials of SubPcs. Moreover, fluorides were found to stabilize the reduced species better than chlorides. The electrochemical study of a series of SubPcs functionalized with fluorophenoxy axial substituents and differing for the number and position of fluorine atoms in the apical moiety (72–78, Fig. 15) revealed that the presence of a fluorine substituent at the meta position of the apical aryl unit varies the half-wave reduction potential by 0.07 V, allowing to fine-tune the electronic properties of the macrocycle.132 In axially aryl-substituted SubPcs, the presence of a substituent different from hydrogen at the para position of the aryl moiety was found to decrease the reversibility of the second reduction process.141 On the other hand, the presence of peripheral cyano groups (Fig. 10) was evidenced to have a stabilizing effect, leading to up to three reversible or quasi-reversible reduction waves, in addition to give rise to easier reduction phenomena.54 Recently, the redox properties of different SubPc derivatives containing axial ferrocenyl substituents have also been investigated.80,83,206,207
 Fig. 15  Chemical structure of the SubPcs axially substituted with fluorophenoxy substituents investigated by Bender and co-workers.132 
The impact of different experimental variables such as the nature of solvents, internal standards and electrolytes, the type of working electrodes and the scan rate on the electrochemical behavior of various SubPc derivatives was systematically investigated by Bender and co-workers, who established a standard operating procedure for data acquisition.208
The redox gap of SubPc is larger than that of Pcs, being the former of about 2.1 eV and the latter of approximately 1.7 eV.1 Several techniques have been employed for the estimation of the absolute HOMO and LUMO energy levels of SubPcs, such as cyclic voltammetry in solution or photoelectron spectroscopy onto highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrates.209,210 A mathematical model has been presented by Bender and co-workers for the prediction of the frontier orbital energy levels in SubPcs from semiempirical or DFT computational data, which was experimentally validated through cyclic voltammetry, absorption spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron techniques for a set of selected SubPc derivatives.210 This study confirmed that the nature of the axial substituent does not affect to a large extent the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, as opposed to what observed for peripheral substituents. In particular, depending on the different peripheral substitution pattern, the HOMO level is commonly situated between −3.3 and −4.7 eV, while the LUMO value can varies between −6.8 and −5.3 eV.


2.3.9 Theoretical calculations. 
Geometry, electronic structure, electrochemical and spectroscopic features of SubPcs have been thoroughly investigated by theoretical calculations.211–233 A detailed study on a series of three SubPc-Cl derivatives bearing different peripheral substituents (i.e. perhydrogenated, trinitro- and tri-t-butyl SubPc) at Hartree–Fock (HF) and density functional theory (DFT) levels using STO-3G and 6-31G basis sets has been reported by Ferro et al.211 The calculated geometries of the unsubstituted derivative were found to be in accordance with the experimental data from X-ray diffraction studies, and no substantial changes were detected with respect to the substituted derivatives. Subtle variations were observed in the B–Cl distance. As a matter of fact, a lengthening or shortening of the distance was detected in the presence of electron-donor or electron-withdrawing substituents, respectively. The study evidenced a close similarity to the experimental values of the calculated dipole moments, which main contribution was shown to correspond to the direction of the axial B–Y bond. Some of the bond constituting the SubPc structure (e.g. B–Cl and B–Ni) were found to be moderately polar, while the electronic density distribution of the macrocycle was observed to not be influenced by the peripheral substitutions. The calculations reproduced the breakdown of the Gouterman's four-orbital model in SubPcs, although a minor difference between HOMO and HOMO−1 was obtained by DFT method. The nodal pattern obtained at semiempirical level was confirmed by HF theoretical calculations, which included a significant contribution of the chlorine atom to the HOMO−1 and an important presence of the substituent in HOMO−1 and LUMO+1. Both DFT and HF calculations confirmed the high π character of the frontier orbitals, from which it is possible to assume the aromatic nature of the macrocycle.
A theoretical study on redox processes in SubPcs was carried out in 2003 through a full geometry optimization at B3LYP/3-21G level.213 This study evidenced that the cone-shaped geometry of the macrocycle is maintained in the charged derivatives even upon donation or subtraction of two electron to/from the SubPc unit. The B–Cl bond was found to suffer the major geometric variation upon electron exchange processes, playing a valuable role in releasing the extra charge from the SubPc ring. In particular, this bond was found to exhibits length variation upon oxidation (shortening) or reduction (lengthening) of the SubPc macrocycle. On the other hand, the electronic density distribution over the entire ionic SubPc species was observed to be almost unchanged in comparison with the neutral species.
The spectral features of SubPcs have been computed by means of TDDFT calculations, which evidenced that the nature of the peripheral substituent affects lo a large extent the absorption profile.214 Calculations showed that the effect of peripheral substituents is different depending on their position (i.e. whether both substituents are located at the same side or different sides of the molecular cone). The computed spectral characteristics were found to agree with the experimental data, especially when solvent effects were included in the model.
In 2017, a TDDFT study on the structural and optical properties of SubPcs was reported.215 In this work, both the ground-state and excited-state properties of SubPcs were investigated using ab initio approaches accounting for environmental effects. The structural parameters and NMR features of SubPcs were reproduced using DFT(PBE0) as level of theory. Moreover, the calculations demonstrated the strong aromatic character of the SubPcs macrocycle, which was quantified and ascribed to their bowl topology and their formal carbocationic nature. Finally, the spectral features (including the emission properties) of SubPcs were investigated. The 0–0 energies were calculated, and were shown to match experimental data with a very low mean absolute deviation (<0.1 eV). The vibronic couplings were calculated ant the origin of the shapes of the absorption and emission bands in terms of vibrational contributions was unravelled.
A year later, the absorption spectra of H12SubPc-Cl in different solvents were calculated using generalized Kohn-Sham density functionals with a non-equilibrium solvation model.216 In particular, the performances of BP86, B3LYP, LC-ωPBE, wB97XD and CAM-B3LYP functionals were compared, and the effect of the inclusion of a first solvation shell was investigated.
Recently, the effect of the axial halogen ligand on the electronic spectra of SubPc derivative in solution and in the solid state was investigated through DFT/TDDFT calculations.217 The computed frontier molecular orbital energies and the simulated spectra were found to match well with the experimental data in solution. Moreover, two configurations (convex-to-convex and concave-to-concave) were modelled for SubPc dimers in the solid state, based on the experimental organization in thin films. For SubPc dimers in the solid state, the computed absorption wavelengths in the visible region were found to increase going down along the halogen series, while the absorption strength was shown to follow an opposite trend. Calculations suggested that that the convex-to-convex configurations of dimers could be the main contributors to the UV-vis spectra of axially halogenated SubPcs in thin films.
Substitution of the central boron atom has also been investigated through theoretical calculations. The structure and stability of SubPc-Cl derivatives in which the central boron had been replaced by aluminium, gallium, carbon, silicon, germanium or magnesium have been studied at the B3LYP/6-31+G*//B3LYP/6-31G* level by Yang and co-workers.218,219 Calculations showed that the stability of derivatives bearing Al, Ga, Si and Ge as central atom is lower than that of boron SubPc due to the steric issues. In the presence of Al, Ga, Si and Ge a more pronounced pyramidal geometry was calculated. On the other hand, the introduction of C as central atom provided the required angle for a regular tetrahedron. A stronger aromaticity was determined for boron SubPcs with respect to Al and Ga analogues on the basis of calculated NICS values. The same conclusions were reached in a publication from Milletti at al., in which the factors responsible for the structural differences among the four SubPc derivatives were analyzed.220
In 2012, a series of free base, boron, aluminium and gallium SubPc structures were studied using calculations at the B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,p) level.221 Metal–ligand bonds, which were investigated using AIM and ELF methods, were found to be intermediate between pure covalent and pure ionic bonds. Moreover, it was suggested that the initial step for the decomposition of SubPcs is the perpendicular attack to the carbon atom close to the meso nitrogen.
Recently, predictive simulations were reported for a series of SubPcs in which the central boron and the axial chlorine atoms had been substituted with different trivalent atoms (i.e. aluminium, gallium, indium, scandium and yttrium) and halogens (i.e. fluorine, bromine, and iodine), respectively.222 The structure, electronic properties and optical properties of these derivatives were calculated both in the gas phase and in their predicted crystalline solid phase. The degree of openness of the cone was found to depend on the nature of the central atom, and the molecular dipole (pointing from the electronegative halogen toward the trivalent atom) was shown to vary from 1 to 6 D. In the bulk crystalline phase, no net polarization was found due to the alternating arrangement of molecular dipoles. Moreover, the static permittivity of the derivatives was found to increase within the halogen series.
In 2012, Yang investigated the borenium and aluminium cations generated by the loss of the axial ligand in the corresponding SubPc derivatives.223 This investigation showed that in the borenium cation, singles states lie well below triplet states, similarly to what observed in most macrocycles without transition metals. In the triplet state, the unpaired electrons delocalized in the conjugated ring, and extra stability is supplied by delocalization. In contrast, in the aluminium cation the triplet states are stabilized through metal-centered and ligand-centered separation of unpaired electrons. The longer Al–N bond length and the smaller N–Al–N bond angle in the triplet state with respect with those in the singlet state are a consequence of the metal-centered unpaired electron, while the ligand-centered unpaired electron leads to the odd number of π electrons in the macrocycle in the triplet state. Accordingly, a notable energy relaxation after the first vertical singlet-to-triplet transition was suggested by TDDFT studies. For both the singlet borenium cation and the singlet aluminium cation, the NICS values at ring centers were found to be negative, indicating the aromatic nature of the rings. On the other hand, the NICS values at the inner rings were found to be positive (which indicate the antiaromatic nature of these rings) and the NICS values at outer rings were close to zero (as the unpaired spin density mainly concentrates in the inner part of the macrocycle) for the triplet borenium cation. Nevertheless, the whole macrocycle is apparently antiaromatic. On the contrary, a single aromatic or antiaromatic nature was not supported by NICS values for the triplet aluminium cation.
The spectral features of SubPcs featuring Al and Ga as central atoms were investigated in 2013 by TDDFT calculations, which revealed bathochromically shifted absorptions with respect to the boron derivatives.224
In 2016, the structure and photochemical properties of beryllium SubPcs complexes were investigated for the first time using TDDFT calculations.225 Such compounds were shown to be thermodynamically stable in the gas phase. The nature of the bonding between the cation and the macrocycle was found to be slightly different from boron SubPc, as revealed by NBO and AIM analyses. On the other hand, the absorption spectra, which were calculated at the BPW91/6-31+G(d)//BPW91/6-31G(d) level of theory, were found to be similar to those of the boron-containing analogues.
In the same year, the self-assembling properties of beryllium SubPcs have been investigated by means of DFT calculations by Yáñez and co-workers.226 In this work, free dimers of Be SubPc and their complexes with water and pyridine were computed at the Wb97X-D/6-331+G(d,p) level of theory. Interestingly, this study revealed the presence of Be–N intermolecular interactions, suggesting that these species are likely to undergo self-assembly.
Recently, a theoretical study on the electronic spectra of a series of SubPc-Cl derivatives bearing Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and Zn as central atoms was reported.227 The optimized results evidenced that these structures may be chemically stable in the gas phase and condensed phase, with an order of stability Fe > Cu > Ni > Co > Zn predicted on the basis of the calculated binding energy. Anyway, all the structures were found to be much less stable than boron-containing SubPcs. The investigated compounds were found to be more non-planar that the corresponding boron derivatives, and were shown to have smaller dipole moments. Moreover, the HOMO–LUMO energy gap in SubPc presenting Co, Ni and Cu as central atoms was determined to be smaller than that of the boron analogue. The simulated absorption wavelength in the visible region for zinc- and nickel-containing SubPcs is red-shifted in comparison to the corresponding boron-SubPc, while in the case of the iron-substituted structure a noticeably stronger absorption strength was found.

2.4 Organization of subphthalocyanines

2.4.1 Organization in the solid state. 
How the molecules arrange in the solid state is relevant to the formation of thin films and charge transport within an organic electronic device. Engineering the crystallization of SubPcs should facilitate a control over the electronic properties influencing the performance of the device. Considering the aromatic nature of SubPcs, the major intermolecular forces accounting for their organization in the solid state are mainly driven by π–π interactions between the isoindole subunits of neighbor macrocycles.234 These interactions can occur through the two different faces of the SubPc bowl, that is, either through the convex (the face where the axial substituent is located) or through the concave face (the opposite to the axial ligand). In this way, three different arrangements are possible: (a) the concave–concave, (b) the convex–convex, and (c) the convex–concave (also called head-to-tail organization).
The crystal structure of perhydrogenated SubPc-Cl 20, first reported in 1974 and confirmed later by Bender, is dominated by π–π interactions between adjacent molecules through their πPyrrole and πPh fragments forming ribbons.65,179,180 Each SubPc-Cl molecule participates in two concave–concave π–π interactions between rings, which are separated by 3.70 Å (Fig. 16a). In addition, two convex–convex π–π interactions with the aromatic rings of neighboring SubPcs of a different row are observed as well as one halogen–π interaction between the B–Cl unit and the peripheral benzene ring of a neighboring molecule. Other unsubstituted SubPc-Halo derivatives (Y = F, Br) are isostructural in the solid state,65 crystallizing in well-defined rows into a concave–concave arrangement.

When bearing an aromatic aryloxy or aryl axial ligand, other arrangements became possible, namely, the SubPc bowls can also interact through the axial aromatic ligand in the concave face (concave-to-ligand, Fig. 17a). However, single crystals of most SubPcs axially functionalized with p-substituted aryloxy groups show organization motifs in which dimeric association of macrocycles through their concave faces predominates (Fig. 17b).235 The different arrangements of SubPcs in the solid state (mainly unsubstituted SubPcs bearing different aryloxy and aryl axial ligands) whose X-ray structures were reported up to 2013 have been previously reviewed by some of us.1 Since then, novel structures of unsubstituted SubPcs bearing other axial ligands have been reported, accounting for the contribution of π–Br,236 π–π,91,96,132 C–H⋯π,141 and hydrogen bonding130 interactions that involve the axial ligand and the macrocycle to direct the formation of one-dimensional ribbons or 2D-networks.

2.4.1.1 Organization of peripherally halogenated subphthalocyanines. 
Due to the increasing interest in peripherally halogenated SubPcs for molecular electronics (that will be discussed in Section 2.7.1.2.2), it is important to expand the understanding of the solid-state organization of these SubPc derivatives and correlate it with properties such as charge-carrier mobilities.237 Here, we will focus on the discussion of the main solid-state motifs found in crystals of peripherally halogenated SubPcs, and the influence of both the type and number of peripheral halogens and that of the axial substituent.
Different organizations have been found in crystals obtained by train sublimation of peripherally chlorinated SubPc-Cl species. Similar to the perhydrogenated derivative 20, perchlorinated Cl12SubPc-Cl 48 arranges in the solid state forming pairs of molecules through a concave–concave π–π interaction between the πPyrrole and πPh rings of the SubPc's periphery at a separation distance of 3.80 Å (Fig. 16d).30 Association in pairs is further driven by two C–Cl⋯πPyrrole interactions between the terminal chlorine atoms and πPyrrole units of the neighboring SubPc involved in the dimer with a close interaction of 3.17 Å and 3.12 Å. Cl⋯Cl interactions are also present between the axial chlorine and two bay chlorine atoms on the periphery of a neighboring SubPc with a separation distance of 3.5 Å and 3.4 Å.
On the contrary, peripherally hexachlorinated Cl6SubPc-Cl forms slip-stacked columns (concave–convex) in which molecules are tilted in alternating directions relative to the b-axis with the axial B–Cl bond pointing towards the aromatic ring of the adjacent molecule (Fig. 16c).30 This arrangement is additionally stabilized by an intercolumn C–Cl⋯πPh interaction between a peripheral C–Cl bond and a neighboring SubPc peripheral benzene ring at a separation distance of 3.5 Å. The corresponding peripherally chlorinated SubPcs with bromine as axial substituent produced crystal structures nearly identical to their respective SubPc-Cl counterparts.30
A similar organization in the solid-state is presented by perfluorinated F12SubPcs with different axial substituents. F12SubPc-Y derivatives (Y = F,159 Cl,266 Br238) arrange in one-dimensional columns in which each SubPc unit is offset and angled in a bowl-to-ligand packing, so that the axial halogen atom is located in the concave face of the neighboring SubPc, underneath the boron atom with an intermolecular Y⋯B distance smaller than the sum of the van der Waals radii. In the F12SubPc-Cl derivative, the axial chloride interacts with a pyrrolic nitrogen (B–Cl⋯Np), as well as with one of three inner pyrrole rings (B–Cl⋯πPyrrole) of a neighboring SubPc unit at a distance of 3.3 Å (Fig. 16b). In the case of the F12SubPc-F derivative, the axial fluoride of one SubPc unit interacts with two of the three inner aromatic five-membered rings of the neighboring SubPc. A C–F⋯N interaction is also observed between a terminal fluorine atom of one SubPc and the imine nitrogen of the neighbor at a distance of 2.9 Å, producing a dense packed structure. Furthermore, the same number of up and down columns exist in the crystals.
A clear influence of the axial substituent on the solid-state arrangement was found in F6SubPc-Y derivatives 3 and 5 (compare Fig. 18A and B). Molecules of F6SubPc-F 5 are arranged in a concave-to-axial ligand way, similar to the packing of F12SubPc-Y species discussed above, where the axial fluoride of one SubPc unit fits within the concave side of a neighboring F6SubPc-F (Fig. 18B).32 The peripheral benzene rings of F6SubPc-F arrange one above the other, at a separation distance of 4.4 Å. Two B–F⋯πPyrrole interactions between the axial fluoride and the aromatic five-membered rings of a neighboring SubPc at a distance ranging from 2.9 Å and 3.1 Å are also observed, along with peripheral F–F interactions between neighboring SubPcs with separation distances of 2.63 Å and 2.61 Å. In contrast, a different organization motif was found for F6SubPc-Cl 3, which is arranged in a concave–concave fashion by π–π interactions between the peripheral isoindole fragments of the two neighboring SubPc units, separated by a distance of 4.03 Å (Fig. 18A). An intermolecular halogen-nitrogen interaction, specifically between one of the terminal fluorines and the pyrrole nitrogen of the neighbor SubPc unit with a distance of 3.0 Å, is also observed. No peripheral fluorine-fluorine interactions are noted in this case.
 Fig. 18  Molecular packing of peripherally hexafluorinated SubPcs: (A) F6SubPc-Cl 3 and (B) F6SubPc-F 5. Adapted with permission from ref. 32. 
Overall, peripherally fluorinated SubPcs, namely F12SubPc-F, F6SubPc-F and F12SubPc-Cl, arrange in a concave-to-axial halide motif (Fig. 16b and 18B). F6SubPc-Cl, on the other hand, exhibits a distorted concave–concave head-to-tail arrangement with only a few π–π interactions.
In summary, the crystal packing of halo-SubPcs is generally not affected by changing the axial chlorine substituent by bromine. However, the axial fluorine significantly enhances a columnar-type type solid state arrangement with intercolumn connections through B–F⋯π interactions. Changes in the nature and number of peripheral halogen substituents also have an impact on the solid-state organization. Peripheral chlorination enhances π–π interactions, while peripheral fluorination enables a column-like arrangement. The number of peripheral chlorine substituents influences more the solid-state arrangement than the number of peripheral fluorine atoms.
As peripherally halogenated SubPcs are π-electron deficient molecules, the introduction of axial π-electron donor aryloxy groups favors π-stacking interactions with shorter distances between the axial substituent and the concave face of the macrocycle.96
The organization of SubPcs in columnar assemblies is experiencing an enormous interest as potential ferroelectric and bulk photovoltaic properties are typically developed in polar organic materials. Due to their polar B–Y bond, when SubPcs organize in columnar assemblies, a macroscopic polarization along their longer axis forming polar assemblies is developed, due to the sum of the individual molecular dipoles. However, as mentioned above when discussing the solid-state organization of SubPcs bearing axial fluorine atoms, the columns are arrayed in a more electrostatically stable, antiparallel orientation, thus cancelling the macrodipoles, and giving rise to non-polar crystals. New rational approaches need to be developed to selectively stabilize parallel orientations in columnar assemblies. Very recently, Miyajima and co-workers have developed a strategy based on spin frustration to form SubPc-based polar assemblies, by inducing a trigonal lattice of the columnar organization using C3-sym bowl-shaped π-systems based on SubPcs.39 For this study, in addition to α-F6SubPc (79) and β-F6SubPc (5), enantiomerically pure C3-α-F3SubPc (80), C1-α-F3SubPc (81), C3-β-F3SubPc (82) C1-β-F3SubPc (83) were used. All of them formed one-dimensional columnar assemblies with SubPcs piled up. α-F6SubPc formed crystals with a trigonal lattice with all SubPcs oriented in the same direction in the crystal by forming a 3D-hydrogen bonding network between fluorine and hydrogen atoms (Fig. 19). The six fluorine and six hydrogen atoms of α-F6SubPc-F form H-bonds with SubPcs located obliquely up and down, respectively, resulting in stagger-like arrangements of macrocycles. Similarly, the other α-F3SubPcs, regardless of the number of fluorine atoms (3 or 6), molecular symmetry (C1 or C3) and chirality (racemic or chiral) formed the same polar crystals. In contrast, all the SubPcs having fluorine atoms at β-positions, such as β-F6SubPc, formed nonpolar assemblies with antiparallel orientation of the SubPc columns due to stronger F–F interactions. Interestingly, it was noticed that β-substituted SubPc-F derivatives possess superior bowl stacking ability than the α-substituted analogues, which results in antiparallel packing. Indeed, remarkable differences in the π–π distances between the SubPcs when comparing the polar (3.74 Å) and non-polar (3.53 Å) assemblies may account for this behavior that can be explained considering the differences in the bowl depths. Therefore, the formation of polar assemblies with C3-sym bowl-shaped molecules based on SubPcs can be induced by enhancing the C3-sym intermolecular interaction and reducing the bowl-stacking nature.

2.4.1.2 Co-crystallization of subphthalocyanines. 
Crystal polymorphs of SubPcs that show inclusion of aromatic solvent molecules (toluene, DCB) within the cavity of the macrocycle have been reported.11,19,185 Single-crystal XRD analysis of chiral peripherally trihalogenated SubPcs, namely β-F3SubPc-Cl, α-F3SubPc-Cl, β-Cl3SubPc-Cl and α-Cl3SubPc-Cl, showed that these derivatives co-crystallized as mixtures of the C1 and C3 regioisomers forming solid-state mixed alloyed compositions.239
More interestingly, the concave face of SubPcs is perfectly adapted to the spherical shape of fullerenes and this results in several reported SubPc/C60 co-crystals,11,111,129,172,184,240 which formation is driven by effective π–π-interactions between the components and in which, typically, a single C60 molecule is embraced by two SubPcs. For a detailed discussion about the formation of SubPc/fullerene complexes in solution we refer the reader to Section 2.5.4.2.
Based on the ability of the SubPc macrocycle of encapsulating fullerenes, a SubPc-based COF meant to act as an electron donating scaffold, able to dock electron-acceptor fullerene C60 in the pockets, has been designed as next generation co-crystalline OPV devices.241 The high internal surface area of the SubPc-based COF, combined with a directional charge transport via columns of acceptor molecules, could overcome the competition between the D–A surface area and long-range order in current OPV architectures.


2.4.2 Organization in thin films. 
The morphology and microstructure of organic thin films determine their optoelectronic properties and device performance.242,243 Generally, thin films with long-range ordered structures, such as single crystalline thin films formed by high vacuum vapor deposition,190,244,245 are desired for device applications, considering their higher charge carrier mobility and longer exciton diffusion length. On the contrary, producing long-range ordered organic thin films via solution processing is a difficult task. The latter has been addressed by introducing post-treatments – such as thermal246 and solvent annealing – on disordered organic thin films, to introduce molecular reorganization and ordering degree of the molecules. It is also important to study whether the solid-state arrangement determined by XRD of single crystals is kept when molecules are deposited as thin films.247
Despite the easy formation of uniform, grain-boundary-free amorphous thin films via simple solution processing of SubPcs, these materials possess relatively low charge carrier mobility, on the order of 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. This is much lower than the typical value for vapor deposited crystalline organic thin films (10−3cm2 V−1 s−1), limiting the exciton diffusion length, and resulting in OPVs with low power-conversion efficiencies. Neither thermal nor solvent annealing post-treatments proved very effective to tune the morphology of solution processed SubPc films until Lin and Ma developed a post-treatment approach capable of introducing molecular ordering (or crystallization) in solution processed organic semiconductor thin films, through a thermal imprint process (or thermal annealing under mechanical gauge pressure).183 In particular, they have shown that large area phase change from amorphous to crystalline morphology for solution processed 2-allylphenoxySubPc (84) thin films can be realized by thermal imprint with a flat mold. Indeed, the XRD spectra of the thin films upon thermal imprint at 90 °C for 12 hours displayed very clear peaks associated with high degree of ordered molecular stacking. The morphological change induced in the films by thermal imprint results in enhanced electronic properties, in particular the hole mobility that increases from 1 × 10−7 to 2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. It was also crucial that 2-allylphenoxy substituted SubPc 84 crystallize forming columnar stacks of macrocycles through which charge carriers can move.
Solution processed thin films of trialkoxylbenzyloxyl-substituted SubPcs 85 and 86 (Fig. 20), spontaneously adopt a highly crystalline lamellar structure in the solid state, which is driven by strong core–core interaction for the peripherally perfluorinated derivatives 85. Within the hydrogenated series 86, decreasing the length of the alkyl side chain (R2 = C6H13) provides the same crystalline behavior by increasing the core–core intermolecular interactions and weakening the van der Waals forces between the alkyl chains.71 As a result of the long-range order, stronger intermolecular electronic coupling between neighboring SubPcs is allowed in these crystalline films, and therefore, more efficient homomolecular energy transfer and larger exciton diffusion lengths have been observed.
 Fig. 20  Molecular structure of SubPcs 84–86 whose solution processed thin films have shown molecular ordering. 
Thin films of Cl6SubPc-Cl (2) are amorphous when thermally evaporated in vacuum on many functional unheated surfaces, such as glass, glass/ITO, untreated silicon (111) wafer, ZnSe, independently on the deposition rate.248 However, they show some diffraction features, attributed to an increasing molecular ordering, upon annealing on the silicon surface heating at a rate of <30 °C min−1 to 150 °C for 10–15 min under continuous Ar flow, followed by a slow cooling down to room temperature.249 More interestingly, annealing of a Cl6SubPc-Cl (2) layer deposited on a CuI surface leads to both appearance of a well-defined ordering of molecules and texturing of the halide underlayer. The role of the CuI is not only to be a growth surface but also a donor component of the hybrid p-CuI/n-Cl6SubPc-Cl (2) heterojunction, which shows improved performance in comparison with the non-structured HHJ device.250 In addition, structural and optical spectroscopic analysis of SubPc 20 deposited as thin films has been performed to accurately estimate the bandgap energy and the emission peaks, which are slightly affected by annealing.251


2.4.3 Organization on surfaces. 
In electronic devices, molecules are in contact with metal surfaces. Therefore, understanding the interactions taking place in such metal–organic semiconductor interfaces is crucial for improving device performance. For that, firstly, it is important to study the adsorption process, then the growth mechanism, and finally the characterization of the ordered molecular arrays formed on the metal substrates, often inferred by spectroscopic techniques.
Different metal/molecule forces, such as dipole interaction, charge transfer, and van der Waals bonding, occur with similar magnitude, making quite unpredictable the resulting thin film structure upon molecular adsorption on different types of metal substrates. Substrate chemical identity plays the most relevant effect on the absorption process. Secondly, the structural diversity of organic semiconductors may be considered.
For instance, dipolar non-planar semiconductors such as SubPc-Cl derivatives tend to flatten when deposited on metal surfaces. Moreover, their cone-shape results in different adsorbate configurations that have been classified as “Cl-up” (with the axial chlorine atom facing vacuum), or “Cl-down” (with chlorine atom pointing towards the substrate). These two configurations differ on the conductance at the molecular center, producing two different STM contrasts.
Although the first SubPc-Cl deposition was described by Yanagi in 2000 on a Si(111) substrate,252 most of the work has been performed on Cu, Au and Ag metal surfaces to yield highly ordered 2D-arrays. From these studies, it can be concluded that the growth of SubPc monolayers is an epitaxial process that respects both the symmetry and the main geometric characteristics of the underlying substrate.
2.4.3.1 Chloro-subphthalocyanine on Cu(111) surfaces. 
Studies reported by Monti in 2016253 have shown that at low coverage, only two types of contrasts are observed by low-temperature STM, independently on the tip–surface voltage (from −2.5 V to +0.5 V). Molecules of type I exhibit a bright center while for type II the conductance increasing in the molecular center is much less pronounced (Fig. 21a). When the two most widely proposed configurations, that is, molecules with chlorine atoms protruding toward vacuum (“Cl-up”, Fig. 21b), and molecules with chlorine atoms oriented toward the substrate (“Cl-down”, Fig. 21b) were simulated by DFT, the results indicated that Cl-up configuration results in the most stable adsorbate geometry, with an adsorption energy of −3.56 eV, and a simulated STM image that is remarkably similar to those observed for type I molecules. Moreover, the simulations revealed that the proposed Cl-down configuration does not form readily on the surface, showing a small adsorption energy of only −0.60 eV. Intriguingly, the simulated STM images in Fig. 21 for the Cl-down configuration look profoundly different from either the type I or the type II molecules observed in the experimental images, suggesting a different nature of the type II configuration. In fact, results were interpreted as a surface-catalysed dechlorination, yielding “DeCl-up” molecules. Simulated DeCl-up molecules show a height increase in the center of the molecule, which is in good agreement with the experimentally determined constant current images for adsorbate type II. It is worthy to point out that no evidence for dechlorination prior to adsorption was found. Indeed, dechlorination of SubPc-Cl is reported to occur in solution, in particular, when nucleophilic solvents and SubPcs bearing peripheral electron-donating groups are employed, because they lead to the formation of a more stable borenium cation. In this case, the Cu(111) can play the same role, acting as an electron donating pool that partially stabilizes the borenium cation formed by dechlorination of the SubPc-Cl molecule.

Both species adsorb preferentially at hcp (hexagonally close-packed) hollow sites of the Cu(111) surface, in order to maximise interactions between the N atoms of the SubPc ligand and the Cu atoms in the first surface layer (Fig. 22). The Cl-up molecules self-assemble on the surface to form two different types of hcp islands, while the DeCl-up molecules remain isolated unless stabilized in a bilayer structure with Cl-down or DeCl-down molecules. Computational studies show that the most favourable adsorption geometry places the axial Cl-B ligand above one of the two hollow sites (hcp and face-centered cubic (fcc) hollow).

The consequences of strong coupling between polar adsorbates such as SubPc-Cl and Cu(111) on the self-assembly at the surface have also been studied. The combination of photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and LT-STM can help to understand these interfaces. UPS measures the work function changes of a system upon surface/molecule interactions. Monti has observed that SubPc-Cl undergoes a significant charge transfer upon adsorption on Cu(111) since a newly filled f-LUMO located at the Fermi level was observed.250 This charge transfer state is interface specific and related to the “Cl-up” orientation of the molecule on the surface. The same author has also studied the origin of the strong electronic coupling between SubPc-Cl and Cu(111), which seems to arise from a planarization of the macrocycle upon adsorption on the surface, driven by strong of van der Waals interactions.254 Under these conditions, the macrocycle loses it peculiar cone-shape geometry and recovers a 94% of planarity, becoming a disk with trigonal pyramidal feature. Moreover, the electronic structure of SubPc-Cl become metallic due to the strong hybridization between molecule and metal states occurring in conjunction with electron transfer from the substrate to adsorbate. In fact, the strong-coupling regime can be reached only provided that the molecule significantly changes its shape, which is shown to be a consequence of van der Waals forces pulling it toward the surface.
2.4.3.2 Chloro-subphthalocyanine on Ag(100) surfaces. 
Individual SubPc-Cl molecules have been clearly visualized by STM on Ag(100) surfaces.255 As in Cu metal surfaces, some SubPc molecules have bright protrusions at their center due to the presence of their axial B–Cl bonds, and were assigned to a Cl-up binding configuration, with the three isoindole moieties bound to the substrate. In contrast, molecules without a bright center are assumed to adopt the Cl-down binding configuration with the molecule's axial chorine atom pointing toward the substrate.
According to Jiang's studies, these two configurations are roughly equivalent in their prevalence, in line with the small difference of 0.09 eV between these two binding configurations on their calculated adsorption energies, i.e., Eup = 0.19 eV vs. Edown = 0.10 eV. DFT simulation identified the interstices of the topmost layer of the Ag(100) substrate as the preferred binding sites for SubPc. The highly dense SubPc layer on Ag(100) can be viewed as stacked chains of molecules mechanically interlocked (Fig. 23), resulting in a zipper-like pattern, different than the honeycomb-like patterns reported before on Ag(111)256 and Au(111).257 Moreover, the SubPc molecules seem to be slightly tilted with respect to the Ag(100) substrate, making the isoindole lobes between adjacent chains closer to the substrate than those interlocked along the same chain. SubPc molecules within the “zipper” pattern are seen to be aligned with the lattice direction of the Ag(100) single crystal. The interactions between either individual molecules or SubPc islands with the underlying Ag(100) are relatively weak, as concluded from Tip-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) and SERS experiments. TERS has been shown to be an effective tool for interfacial characterization of nanoscale molecular systems, since small shifts of a vibrational peak are due to strong molecule–substrate coupling.258 The vibrational spectra exhibit no discernible differences in peak position and/or intensity between the Cl-up and Cl-down binding configurations. The B–Cl bond-stretching mode should be much more susceptible to frequency shift than others, due to the plausibly strong coupling between the Ag(100) substrate and the highly polarizable chlorine atom of SubPc regardless of its binding configuration. Moreover, the intermolecular interactions between SubPc molecules within an island on the Ag(100) substrate are also relatively weak. Otherwise, the strong couplings between SubPc molecules would have notably deviated their vibrational frequencies from those for an isolated molecule. Both molecule–substrate and molecule–molecule interactions are rather weak for the self-assembled SubPc layer on Ag(100).

2.4.4 Organization in columnar assemblies. 
Supramolecular columnar assemblies of π-conjugated disc-like molecules are suitable materials for optoelectronics because they are hold by π–π interactions between molecular components, that facilitates the contact between their π-surfaces and, therefore, the efficient exciton and charge transport along the column axis. In particular, discotic molecules forming spontaneous columnar liquid crystals have been extensively studied. In those assemblies van der Waals forces between the aliphatic chains contribute to stabilizing the organized columnar mesophase, in addition to π-stacking. SubPcs are peculiar molecules with bowl-shape geometry, always bearing an axial substituent. Therefore, their organization in columnar liquid crystalline phases requires SubPcs bearing small axial ligands (typically fluorine) which can stack in a head-to-tail fashion. The resulting columnar assemblies present some additional features, that is, they are non-centrosymmetric due to the intrinsic C3 symmetry of the components. In addition, these assemblies are polar, if we consider that all the polar B–Cl or B–F bonds may be oriented in the same direction within the column. The non-centrosymmetric head to-tail or convex-to-concave columnar organization, with a permanent axial dipole moment observed for SubPcs, induces a macroscopic polarization that can result in electric-field-responsive polar materials.259
2.4.4.1 Columnar assemblies in solution. 
Nonplanar molecules such as SubPcs are reluctant toward aggregation, especially if they bear bulky substituents at the axial position. This has been so far the basis of their applications in organic optoelectronics. Nevertheless, the aggregation of bowl-shaped polar molecules in columnar stacks that can interact with electric fields is quite challenging, since they can generate polarly ordered materials exhibiting switchable (i.e., ferroelectric) or permanent polarization, as well as anisotropic charge transport.
SubPc 87a (Fig. 24), bearing peripheral primary amide substituents and a bulky tert-butylphenoxy axial substituent, is fully dissociated in H-bonding competing solvents such as dioxane, but it undergoes a concave–concave dimerization process in non-polar solvents such as toluene or methylcyclohexane (MCH) (Fig. 24a).38 The supramolecular scenario changes radically in SubPc 87b bearing a very small axial fluorine ligand, forming robust SubPc-based columnar nanostructures in strongly non-polar solvents (MCH, heptane or dodecane) by a convex–concave supramolecular polymerization (Fig. 24).37 In that case, the weakly bound SubPc stacks are further stabilized by three lateral H-bonds between peripheral arylamides. The presence of a strongly polar axial B–F bond additionally reinforces convex–concave association due to dipole–dipole interactions. Detailed aggregation studies were carried out by monitoring UV-vis absorption, emission, and CD spectral changes as a function of temperature, concentration and solvent nature. Whereas both 87a and 87b show a Q band absorption at 580 nm as monomers, Fig. 24b and c show the different spectral changes experienced by both monomers as a function of the volume fraction of dioxane (χD) in a MCH solution (3.2 × 10−5 M, T = 20 °C). Fig. 24c clearly shows a critical solvent composition in which polymerization of SubPc 87b is abruptly triggered, with a clear isosbestic point at 528 nm. The self-assembly mechanism was analyzed by the cooperative nucleation-elongation model developed by Meijer and co-workers, inferring first the formation of a dimer (nucleation) that then grows via a cooperative mechanism by successive SubPc stacking. The main thermodynamic parameters, both for the nucleation (dimer formation): ΔH0nucl = −11.7 kJ mol−1, and Knucl = 7.1 × 103 M−1, as well as for the elongation process: ΔH0e = −56.1 kJ mol−1, ΔS0 = −55.0 J mol−1 K, Ke = 4.2 × 105 M−1, and Te = 344.9 K, ΔG0 = −38.0 kJ mol−1 and σ = 0.027 are in agreement with this proposal. In addition, SubPc 87b is a C3-symmetric chiral molecule, whose enantiomers (P and M) can be easily separated by HPLC. Aggregation studies were carried out for each isolated enantiomer by UV-vis absorption, emission, and CD spectroscopies, indicating the formation of homochiral non-centrosymmetric columns (Fig. 25). Specifically, compound 87b displayed blue-shifted absorption (Q band at 518 nm whereas the monomer absorbs at 580 nm), a significantly quenched emission, and a remarkably different CD spectrum upon aggregation, which is a mirror image for each enantiomer. In addition, hydrogen bonding between the exocyclic amide groups was confirmed by 1H-NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. Interestingly, important differences were observed when comparing the absorption changes at 580 nm as a function of temperature for the racemic mixture of 87b and that of its P or M enantiomers, indicating that the racemic stacks are substantially more stable than the homochiral stacks obtained from the individual enantiomers. These results can only be explained considering a clear preference for heterochiral head-to-tail binding in the self-assembly of racemic 87b. Quantum chemical calculation studies additionally shed light to understand the cooperative character and the chiral self-sorting for this self-association process. It was found that the optimal peripheral amide conformation in enantiomer P of SubPc 87b leading to the most stable homochiral right-handed (P) helical stack, is the one named anti-in, with the carbonyl dipole aligned antiparallel to the axial SubPc B–F bond, and in orientation with respect to the isoindole ring, in order to both maximize the intermolecular H-bonding and minimise the net dipole moment of the assembly. In the stacks, neighbouring molecules are separated by 4.12 Å and rotated by 23.08°, establishing that 16 molecules are necessary to complete one helical pitch. In addition, The Fδ−⋯Bδ+ contacts between adjacent molecules are calculated to measure 2.78 Å, which are significantly shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of boron (1.92 Å) and fluorine (1.47 Å), that evidencing the contribution of the strong dipolar interaction between B–F dipoles along the stacks. As shown in Fig. 26, as the columnar stack grows, the H-bonding network strengthens and the aggregate becomes more stable, suggesting a cooperative character to the self-assembly of SubPc 87bP in non-polar solvents. Moreover, these studies reproduced the experimental CD of a right-handed trimer made of three P enantiomers of SubPc 87b with an anti-in conformation. Theoretical calculations also helped to understand the reason why pure enantiomers (M and P) self-associate with itself forming homochiral columns, whereas an alternate stacking of P and M enantiomers is favoured from racemic samples. The formation of a helical heterochiral supramolecular polymer was found to be energetically favored against a homochiral polymer to maximize core-to-core contacts of head-to-tail heterochiral stacks, thus in agreement with the self-discrimination process experimentally observed.

Very recently, a SubPc-F peripherally substituted with nine tetra(ethylene glycol) chains (three per isoindole unit) has been reported by Torres, García-Iglesias and co-workers. This novel amphiphilic derivative can self-assemble in water forming spherical nanoparticles with a hydrodynamic diameter of 154 nm, as determined by DLS.260
2.4.4.2 Liquid crystalline columnar assemblies. 
Liquid crystalline behaviour of SubPcs bearing at their peripheral positions six long alkyl chains ranging from 10 to 18 carbon atoms was reported years ago, provided that they contain a relatively small axial chlorine substituent.261 Transition from mesophase to isotropic liquid occurred at ca. 90 °C. More recently, Guilleme et al. have reported a more sophisticated design of a trisubstituted SubPc (88b, Fig. 27a) with a C3 symmetry, bearing a small fluorine axial group, which form columnar LCs.102 According to DSC thermograms, once melted to the isotropic liquid (I), the mesophase appears on cooling at 89.2 °C, and maintains stable at room temperature for several weeks. Semiempirical calculations showed that aggregation within a column is not only driven by dispersion or van der Waals forces, but also by strong F⋯B dipolar interactions between adjacent SubPcs. Therefore, the axial, highly electronegative fluorine atom was key to obtain a stable head-to-tail non-centrosymmetric columnar stacking with a strong axial dipole (Fig. 27b). A second harmonic generation (SHG) signal was observed in the mesophase when the material was cooled down from the isotropic liquid under a DC field. This SHG response was preserved after turning off the field and maintained at room temperature for several weeks without appreciable degradation, indicating that the material has a macroscopic polar axis along the direction of the field. However, SHG interferometry showed that the liquid crystal sample is permanently polarized once formed, but it is not electrically invertible. In other words, the mesophase is not ferroelectric but pyroelectric. The only way to invert the polarization of the material is to heat back to the isotropic phase, and cool down again by applying an electric field in the opposite sense (Fig. 27c).

(c) Schematic representation of the polarization behavior of a LC film of SubPc 88b. Arrows represent groups of molecular dipoles which assemble in columns in the mesophase.

Very recently, the mesogenic properties regioisomeric C1/C3 mixtures of trisubstituted SubPc-F derivatives incorporating either none- (88a) mono- (88c) or bis(thienyl) (88d) units in the peripheral arms have been reported, showing the formation of polar parallel dimers in the case of the thienyl derivatives, that pile up into polar liquid crystalline columnar phases, as confirmed by X-ray scattering, dielectric spectroscopy, second harmonic generation, alignment, and conductivity studies.262
Although SubPc 87 also exhibits a thermotropic LC behaviour, the high viscosity of the mesophase and the high transition temperature to the isotropic liquid (i.e. around 250 °C) make its processing difficult and prevent possible applications. Therefore, authors tried to keep the columnar order of the mesophase while adding a nonpolar solvent that would be incorporated within the columns, hence weakening the intermolecular forces between SubPcs. Indeed, a 10 wt% (3.4 × 10−2 M) SubPc 87 solution in dodecane formed amphitropic columnar LCs that are stable at room temperature.263 POM and X-ray diffraction studies indicated the formation of a columnar nematic NCol lyotropic mesophase which, as other nematic mesophases, has shown an electro-optic response.
A polar switching was confirmed by texture observations and SHG methods. When an electric field of 10 V μm−1 was applied, a black texture could be observed between crossed polarizers, which was retained for at least several minutes when the electric field was turned off. Moreover, a molecular reorientation occurred when voltage was inverted, reappearing the brown texture. In line with these results, strong SHG signals were observed when the sample was subjected to an electric field, which saturate for fields in the range of 10 V mm−1, indicating that the material has a macroscopic polar axis along the field direction. A remanent polarization (Pr) of ca. 0.13 mC cm−2 was calculated. To further confirm the switching process, SHG interferometry experiments were carried out, showing that positive and negative fields induced opposite polarities in the sample. Therefore, this material was considered as the first nematic columnar ferroelectric phase. Taking into account that bowl inversion of SubPc 87 within the columns is not likely to occur, authors have speculated that the SubPc columns might disassemble into shorter columns that could move from up to down and invert their macrodipoles upon field application (Fig. 27).
More recently, the problem of the high temperature required to melt the mesophase of SubPc 87 was circumvented by applying an external field of ca. 30 V μm−1 at 130–140 °C, for about 20 min, which resulted in a high degree of homeotropic alignment. Using this alignment procedure, Kemerink et al. developed the first organic material in which charge transport is coupled to ferroelectric polarization.264 The supramolecular organization of the SubPc 87 in columnar assemblies provides long-range polar order that supports collective ferroelectric behavior of the amide side groups, as well as charge transport through the stacked semiconducting SubPc macrocycles. Simultaneous switching of polarization and conductivity measurements of devices based on LCs of SubPc 87 sandwiched between gold electrodes, indicated a polarization reversal when the externally applied electric field passed the coercive field, as well as a strong rectifying behavior at low voltages. The experiments displayed a remarkable hysteresis behavior in the current–voltage (j–V) loop which is attributed to a bulk conductivity modulation. In other words, the material switches from a high conductivity state, when polarization and conductivity are parallel, to a low conductivity state, when they are antiparallel (Fig. 28).

Very recently, Zhang et al. have revisited the mesogenic behaviour of the (SC12H25)6SubPc derivative 89, bearing this time an axial fluorine substituent. 89 has been organized in hexagonal columnar mesophases and further oriented perpendicular to electrodes at the Colh phase temperature (70 °C) under application of a DC E-field of 10 V μm−1, resulting in the development of spontaneous polarization along the columnar axes (Fig. 29).13 The orientation of the LC assemblies along the applied E-field direction was maintained for at least six months unless the samples were heated up to their isotropic melt. These columnar assemblies additionally exhibit a bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), which implies the direct current generation under photoirradiation. Before measurements, the samples were poled under DC E-field of 10 V μm−1, and upon light irradiation over a wide range of wavelengths up to 650 nm, a photocurrent of 0.13 μA cm−2 at zero voltage and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.18 V was observed. Furthermore, just by sandwiching this columnar assembly between two ITO electrodes, the resultant device reached a light-on/off ratio, Ilight/Idark, as high as 6.6 × 103, indicating that the polar columnar assemblies with SubPcs are promising for visible light photodetectors.

To the best of our knowledge, only one report of liquid crystalline SubPcs bearing the requested aliphatic long chains at the axial position has been published.244 Specifically, unsubstituted SubPc 86 (R1 = H, R2 = C12H25) adopts an hexagonal columnar mesophase between 19 °C and 68 °C, driven by weak core–core interactions and strong van der Waals forces. Photophysical studies indicate a J-aggregate-like character of this SubPc-C12-based mesophase. An increase in the length of the axial alkyl chains narrows the temperature window over which liquid crystallinity exists. In fact, SubPc 86 (R1 = H, R2 = C16H33) forms a smectic liquid crystalline phase only between 44 °C and 55 °C.

2.5 Subphthalocyanine-based multicomponent systems

2.5.1 Subphthalocyanine fused systems. 
In contrast to flat polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), curved π-conjugated systems exhibit enhanced solubility and decreased aggregation by π–π stacking. Moreover, introducing heteroatoms into aromatic π-extended frameworks results in molecular building blocks that exhibit unusual properties like, for instance, metal coordination provided by the presence of nitrogen atoms.
Fused SubPc dimers (SubPc)2, that is, π-extended aromatic molecules comprising two SubPc units merged through a common benzene ring, are unique SubPc derivatives with peculiar geometry and optical properties. As mentioned, SubPcs possess a rigid tetrahedral structure that do not undergo bowl inversion, giving rise to configurationally stable cone-shaped molecules. Therefore, when two SubPc units are fused, two rigid topoisomers are formed in equal amounts, namely, the syn, with the two axial substituents at the boron atoms pointing towards the same direction, and displaying a full hemicircular geometry, and the anti topoisomer, with axial groups pointing towards opposite directions, and forming a S-shaped molecule (Fig. 30).265,266
 Fig. 30  Molecular structure of the two possible topoisomers, syn and anti, formed by benzo-fusing two SubPc units. 
This type of SubPc analogues were prepared and unequivocally characterized independently by Torres and Kobayashi in 2002,265,266 by mixed condensation of 1 equiv. of 1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene and 10 equiv. of tetrafluorophthalonitrile in the presence of three moles of BCl3, heating at reflux of p-xylene (Table 2, method A). After purification by column chromatography on silica gel, bright dark blue SubPc dimers 90a were obtained in 20% yield, accompanied by very small quantities of a mixture of the dark blue SubPc fused trimers, which theoretically consists of three topoisomers (syn,syn, syn,trans, and trans,trans). 1H-NMR spectra of each topoisomers 90a-anti and 90a-syn showed diagnostic singlets at 10.48 and 10.46 ppm, respectively, corresponding to the protons attached to the central benzene ring. Both topoisomers exhibit similar spectroscopic features that include a remarkable bathochromic shift of ca. 120 nm of their Q-band absorptions relative to their parent monomers, appearing at about 700 nm (Table 2).

Along the last 19 years, few other fused SubPc dimers bearing different either (a) peripheral substitution, (b) axial functionalization or (c) aromatic bridge subunit have been reported. In some cases, the corresponding trimers have been also described.
2.5.1.1 Changes at the periphery. 
The preparation of SubPc fused dimers 90 from tetrafluorophthalonitrile presents several advantages such as: (i) it provides good solubility to the final macrocycle, (ii) its symmetry allows an easier NMR characterization, and (iii) it forms stable derivatives. Very few other peripheral substituents such as halogens, thioether, and phenoxy groups have been incorporated into fused SubPc dimers, all of them with lower yields.187,267–270 The synthetic methods, summarized in Table 2, are very similar, only differing in the excess of phthalonitrile acting as peripheral unit employed, and the addition or not of o-DCB as reaction co-solvent. Most probably, either the lack of stability and/or solubility of the intermediates or final products might be the reason for the remarkable different yields, which are also summarized in Table 2. In some cases, these problems could be overcome by performing a subsequent substitution of the axial chlorine atoms by a phenoxy group on the reaction crude (Table 2, method A + D) in order to obtain stable and soluble products, amenable of being purified by column chromatography, size exclusion chromatography or recycling preparative HPLC. The latter was, for instance, the approach for preparing (SubPc)291 bearing peripheral octylthioether groups.267,268 Whereas the chlorinated axial derivates decomposed on silica gel, the corresponding tert-butylphenoxy derivatives were obtained in 16% yield after purification by column chromatography. On the other hand, the reduced symmetry of the 4-iodophthalonitrile precursor led to the formation of a SubPc dimer 92 as a complex mixture of 14 isomers, which was difficult to characterize.267,268Table 2 also indicates the cases in which the corresponding topoisomers syn and anti were separated.
Peripheral substitution showed a very strong effect on the absorption bands of dimers (see Table 2). In particular, electron-donating octylthioether substituents (as in 91), led to a Q band absorption centered at 739 nm, which is red-shifted by around 45 nm with respect to perfluoro-substituted compound 90.
2.5.1.2 Influence of the aromatic/pseudoaromatic central shared bridge. 
Apart from benzene, there are scarce examples of other aromatic units have been introduced as the fused bridge shared by the two SubPcs, the reason being the difficult preparation of the corresponding tetracyano-precursors. Thus, Kobayashi and Shimizu reported in 2016 the pyrene-bridged dimer 96 by cross-condensation of 2,7-di-tert-butyl-4,5,9,10-tetracyanopyrene and tetrafluorophthalonitrile.129 Similar to the case of benzene-bridged SubPc dimers, the two isomers syn and anti, arising from the connection manner to the two bowl-shaped SubPc units were equally formed and separated. Both showed very similar spectroscopic features, so that the final configuration assignment was performed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. In fact, the syn configuration of dimer 96 was unambiguously determined by growing co-crystals of syn-96 and C60, which is embraced by the large convex–convex π-surface of the SubPc dimer. The absorption spectrum of both topoisomers of compound 96 exhibited a Q band at 610 nm in CHCl3, that is, shifted to the red and broadened relative to the SubPc monomers. However, it is remarkably blue-shifted relative to the Q band of SubPc dimers 90b (at 690 nm), indicating a smaller electronic interaction of the SubPc unit through the pyrene bridge.
In 2015 Kobayashi reported a peculiar pseudofused SubPc dimer (97) in which two SubPc units were fused to the two benzene rings of a [2.2]paracyclophane.128 Since two sp3-hybridized ethylene bridges are linking two benzene units, they are neither linear and π-conjugated. However, owing to the small distance (less than 3 Å) between them, through-space transannular interactions have been demonstrated in this type of SubPc dimers that are coined as Subphthalocyaninophanes. As a consequence of the [2.2]paracyclophane two-layer topology, standard cyclotrimerization of 4,5,12,13-tetracyano-[2.2]paracyclophane with an excess of tetrafluoro-phthalonitrile in the presence of boron trichloride, followed by substitution of axial chlorine by phenol, afforded a mixture of three isomers that differ in the orientation of the convex and concave surfaces of the SubPc units with respect to the paracyclophane moiety, namely, the concave–concave (CC), the convex–concave (CV), and the convex–convex (VV) isomers (Fig. 31). Monomeric endo and exo cyclophaneSubPcs formed by cyclomerization of only one phthalonitrile subunit were also isolated. Interestingly, the higher yields of VV and exo derivatives, as compared to those of CC and endo, are indicative of preferential formation of the less sterically hindered compounds with the adjacent moiety residing on the exo side of the SubPc unit. In the 1H-NMR spectra, the chemical shifts of the cyclophane hydrogen atoms (sharing unit) are consistent with the orientation of each SubPc unit with respect to the cyclophane bridge in each isomer, that is, depending if they are facing the concave or the convex face. In any case they never reach the downfield shifted values of SubPc dimers sharing a benzene ring (around 10 ppm), indicating the lack of π-conjugation. These protons experience the largest upfield shift (by 3.92 ppm) with respect to those of unsubstituted [2.2]paracyclophane in isomer CC, as a consequence of a strongest diatropic ring current on the endo side. Owing to their presence on both endo and exo sides, the signals of the cyclophane hydrogen atoms appear at 6.48 and 2.38 ppm in the case of CV. In contrast with the previously reported SubPc fused dimer 90a, the Q-band of all Subphthalocyaninophane dimer isomers were centered at ca. 594 nm, experiencing very small redshift with respect to those of SubPc-cyclophane monomers (8 nm) and with respect to regular SubPcs (and 20 nm). The latter can be rationalized considering a small through-space expansion of the conjugated systems through the cyclophane bridge. Moreover, CV and VV isomers exhibited a broadening and a decrease in intensity of the Q band, and in the case of VV, the Q-band absorption split into two peaks at 617 and 593 nm.
 Fig. 31  Schematic representation of the three possible isomers of Subphthalocyaninophane 97 described by Kobayashi.128 
2.5.1.3 Influence of the axial substituent. 
Replacement of axial halogen atoms of SubPc dimers with phenols allowed the preparation of more stable and soluble derivatives. Most authors made it by refluxing the crude product from the mixed condensation reaction of phthalonitriles with phenol or 4-tert-butylphenol in toluene for 16–24 hours (Table 2, method A + D). In this way, axially functionalized dimers 90b and 90c were obtained in 13 and 19% yields, respectively.265–268 Axial substitution reaction from pure fused SubPc dimers 90a under the same conditions led to similar overall yields. Similar to what is observed in SubPcs, axial substitution by phenoxy groups causes only a very small blue-shift in the Q band absorption of SubPc fused dimers. The phenol groups in the axial position not only provide increased solubility and stability to SubPcs and SubPc fused dimers, but they can also be a tool for the assignment of the syn and anti topologies by means of 1H-NMR spectroscopy.265 The aromatic signals corresponding to the axial tert-butylphenol appear at 5.2–5.5 and 6.7–6.9 ppm in all dimers (90c, 91 and 92). The signals at 5.2–5.5 ppm, corresponding to the protons that are closer to the π-surface of the SubPc moiety, were employed as probes for the assignment of each topoisomer. While in the anti isomer the chemical shifts of the aromatic phenolic protons are very similar to those of the corresponding SubPc, in the syn isomer the proximity of the axial groups (less than 3 Å) and their resulting interaction shift significantly the signals with respect to those of the SubPc (ca. 0.2 ppm).
Interestingly, when 3-hydroxybenzaldehyde was used as axial ligand to prepare 90d, only the corresponding syn-diformyl topoisomer was obtained in overall 5% yield.271 Even more surprisingly, only decomposition products could be observed when the axial substitution was carried out from pure dichloro anti isomer 90a, while in the case of the syn topoisomer, axial substitution proceeded with 47% yield starting from pure syn dichloroSubPc 90a.
Recently, functionalization of a 1:1 mixture of syn/anti dichloro-SubPc fused dimers 90a using a mild procedure described by Nielsen87 allowed the easy introduction of ethynyl axial groups by reaction with trimethylsilylacetylene mediated by AlCl3 forming 90e (Table 2, method E).58 The small size and lack of polarity of the ethynyl axial substituents precluded the separation of the topoisomers by chromatographic work up on silica gel and moreover, they exhibited identical 1H-NMR and UV-vis features. This bis(ethynyl)SubPc fused dimer 90e could be further axially functionalized by Sonogashira coupling with a monoiodo-SubPc, allowing the preparation of an interesting SubPc-SubPc fused dimer 99 (see Fig. 32) whose ability to complex fullerene has been demonstrated (see discussion later in Section 2.5.4.2).58 Besides the preparation of this particular derivative, compound 90e seems to be a very promising starting material for introducing complex axial substituents in good yield through a convergent synthetic strategy. The 1:1 mixture of topoisomers 99, which physical separation was possible after tedious chromatography, showed two different blue-greenish spots by TLC. Also in this case the anti-99 topoisomer showed gradual decomposition in solution, contrasting with the syn-99 topoisomer, which could be spectroscopically characterized. The 1H-NMR spectra of syn-99 in CDCl3 showed the diagnostic singlets at high chemical shifts around 10.50 ppm corresponding to the protons of the central benzene ring of the SubPc fused dimer unit. The appearance of more than one singlet indicates the formation of different stereoisomers, rac and meso, depending on the mutual relative orientation of the two axial ethynyl-SubPcs linked to each boron atom of the SubPc dimer platform. Signals corresponding to these axial SubPc fragments, in particular those of the benzene units closer to the concave face of the SubPc fused dimer, are significantly upfield shifted (0.7 ppm) owing to the well-stablished influence of the anisotropic ring current of the aromatic SubPc dimer surface. UV-vis absorption spectra of SubPc-SubPc dimer hybrids syn-99 and anti-99 in chloroform are basically defined as the sum of their macrocyclic components. Both compounds feature the characteristic Q band maximum of the perfluorinated SubPc dimer unit at 696 nm, with a number of less intense shoulders at higher energy, followed by the Q band of the octysulfanyl-substituted SubPc units peaking at 596 nm. The high intensity of this band, approximately doubling that of SubPc monomer, supports the presence of two units of SubPc per unit of SubPc dimer in the final structure of anti/syn-99.

2.5.1.4 Unsymmetrical subphthalocyanine fused dimers. 
The preparation of SubPc fused dimers with different peripheral substituents at each SubPc half implying the cross-condensation of 1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene and two different phthalonitriles, would probably lead to complex reaction mixtures. Torres and co-workers have developed a stepwise synthetic method to prepare these SubPc dimers from ortho-dicyano-substituted SubPc derivatives 37–41,48 which are then subject to standard cross-condensation with another differently substituted phthalonitrile in the presence of BCl3.48 Among the possible combinations, the preparation of push–pull derivatives with potential unsymmetrical electronic distribution along their extended aromatic surface was tackled. For that, one SubPc half was decorated with electron acceptor substituents and the other half with electron-donor ones. In particular, condensation of di(tert-butyl)-substituted SubPc 41 with 4,5-dichlorophthalonitrile in the presence of BCl3 proceeded in 16% yield to provide the unsymmetrical dimer 98 using an optimized SubPc/phthalonitrile/BCl3 ratio of 1:4:6. The alternative experimental procedure that imply first the activation of 4,5-phthalonitrile and then, the addition of a solution of dicyano-SubPc 41 in p-xylene, resulted more convenient. In this case, although the starting dicyano-SubPc 41 was bearing a p-tert-butylphenoxy group as axial substituent, the final dimer was isolated as a dichloro derivative, probably due to the excess of BCl3 employed. Dimer 98a was purified by column chromatography on silica gel, and the product was found to be stable, as a syn/anti 1:1 mixture. Separation of the two topoisomers of dimer 98a was not possible during the chromatographic purification step. However, the substitution reaction of the two axial chlorine atoms by 4-tert-butylphenol allowed for the separation of both topoisomers anti-98b and syn-98b in 90% overall yield (Scheme 12). Dimer 98b could also be obtained with similar yields by reaction of SubPc 39 with 4-tert-butyphthalonitrile (Scheme 12).
 Scheme 12  Stepwise synthesis of unsymmetrically substituted SubPc fused dimers from ortho-dicyanoSubPcs developed by Torres and co-workers.48 
The 1H-NMR spectrum of dimer 98 in CDCl3 exhibits several diagnostic singlets between 10.40 and 10.35 ppm, corresponding to the two highly deshielded protons of the central benzene ring. The appearance of more than one singlet for each topoisomer evidences that they are in fact a mixture of three different regioisomers defined by the relative position of tert-butyl groups in the electron-donating SubPc moiety.
2.5.1.5 Heterodinuclear fused dimers. 
The combination of a flat Pc macrocycle and a bowl-shaped SubPc subunit which share a benzene ring result in new hybrid large π-conjugated systems with different topologies and aggregation properties. Kobayashi reported in 2014 the preparation of Pc-SubPc fused heterodimer 100 (Fig. 33) by cross-condensation of an ortho-dicyano Zn(II)Pc derivative and excess of the corresponding phthalonitrile under standard reaction conditions, in the presence of BCl3.187 In this case, electronic interactions between the SubPc and the ZnPc units have been inferred from the absorption spectrum of heterodimer 100, which is quite different to the sum of the spectra of ZnPc and SubPc constituents. While the Q bands of ZnPc and SubPc monomers are centered at 708 and 604 nm, respectively, the heterodimer 100 shows a strong Q band absorption at 800 nm in CHCl3. Besides, aggregation and spectroscopic properties of this heterodimer are intermediary between those of the homodimers of the constituent unit, i.e. ZnPc-ZnPc and SubPc-SubPc 94.
 Fig. 33  Hetereodinuclear fused dimers reported by Kobayashi, Jiang and co-workers.187,188 
Jiang and co-workers described in 2016 the preparation of the first fused heterodimer 101 made up of a porphyrin (Por) and a SubPc components sharing a quinoxaline unit (Fig. 33).188 Similar to the Pc-SubPc dimer, this molecule exhibits a peculiar planar-bowl structure confirmed by XRD analysis. The synthetic methodology employed, as for previous fused dimers, consisted first in a mixed cyclotrimerization of two phthalonitrile precursors (1 mol of 20,30-dicyano-pyrazino[2,3-b]porphyrin and 13 mol of 4,5-bis(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)phthalonitrile) in the presence of BCl3, in a refluxing aromatic solvent (in this particular case, chlorobenzene), and subsequent axial substitution with phenol. Por-SubPc-fused hybrid 101 displays two intense Soret-like absorptions at 410 and 439 nm and relatively weak Q-like bands at 500–700 nm. Compared to the absorption spectra of the Por and SubPc references, the red-shifted and distinctly altered spectral features of 101 indicate a strong conjugative interaction between the Por and SubPc moieties through the quinoxaline-fused bridge (Fig. 33).


2.5.2 Axially linked “all-SubPc” systems. 
2.5.2.1 Oxygen- and nitrogen-bridged subphthalocyanine dimers. 
Despite the first report about the preparation of μ-oxo-(SubPc)2102 based on the dehydration reaction of two SubPc-OH units 56 appeared in 1996 by Hanack,272 the yields were very low and the reaction conditions quite irreproducible. A more convenient and reliable method for the preparation of 102, based on an equimolar reaction of SubPc-OH 56 with SubPc-Br 31 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene, in the presence of K3PO4 acting as a HBr scavenger (Table 3, method A), was reported later by Bender.153 This method also gave access to unsymmetric oxygen bridged SubPc dimers constituted by two differently substituted SubPc units (Fig. 34). In particular, dimers 103–105 were prepared in 36%, 40%, and 43% yield, respectively, by treating equimolar amounts of SubPc-OH 56 with the corresponding SubPc-Halo, namely F12SubPc-Br, Cl6SubPc-Cl, or Cl12SubPc-Cl, in the presence of K3PO4 in 1,2-dichlorobenzene at 180 °C for 1 hour. One of the peculiar properties of these SubPc derivatives is their high solubility in a broad range of solvents. On the other hand, whereas the electrochemical properties of these oxygen-bridged SubPc dimers are not very different to those of related SubPc-Halo derivatives, the absorption and fluorescence properties are remarkably different. Thus, their UV-vis spectra display a Q band absorption with a noticeable blue shift and broadening in comparison with those of the corresponding SubPc monomers. Moreover, their emission spectra showed unusual red-shifted and large Stokes shifts, together with very low fluorescence quantum yields. Very recently, femtosecond transient absorption measurements have revealed the ultrafast excimer formation from the initial exciton of symmetric dimer μ-oxo-(SubPc)2102, which in polar solvents decays to form a charge separated state.273 Moreover, the performance of μ-oxo-(SubPc)2102 in planar heterojunction organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices has been tested, showing good results when applied as an electron donating material in simple bilayer structures with C70 as acceptor layer. Thereafter their HOMO/LUMO energy levels are well-placed to apply it as a bifunctional donor/acceptor interlayer material in both energy and charge cascade OPV device architectures.274

 Fig. 34  Molecular structure of axially linked SubPc dimers. 
In 2016 Torres and co-workers reported the preparation of μ-aza-(SubPc)2 derivatives using an innovative stepwise procedure via activated SubPc triflate species (method B, Scheme 13).74 The synthetic route toward unsymmetrical μ-azo SubPc dimers 107–110 involves the reaction of (dodecafluoro)SubPc(NHPh) 111 or 112 with the corresponding triflate, either 113 or 114 from hexa(octylthio)SubPc-Cl or (dodecafluoro)SubPc-Cl (method B, Table 3) in refluxing toluene, affording the desired μ-azo dimers in moderate yields. The introduction of reactive functionalities, such as iodo, in the aniline substituent opens the door to the incorporation of these μ-azo SubPc compounds in multicomponent systems of higher complexity. UV-vis absorption and emission spectra of the nitrogen-bridged SubPcs 107–110 were registered in different solvents at room temperature to evaluate any solvent polarity effects. As in the case of the oxygen-bridged SubPc dimers, they exhibit blue shifted and significantly broadened Q band absorptions (λmax (109) = 560 nm; λmax (107) = 548 nm) with respect to the corresponding monomeric SubPc-Cl. These dimers display a single fluorescence emission maximum that is strongly red shifted (λmax (109) = 610 nm, λmax (107) = 652 nm, in comparison with the monomeric species (λmax = 588 nm), as well as large Stokes shifts. Apart from particular differences, the effect of the bridging atom (i.e. N vs. O) does not seem to influence significantly the electronic properties of these SubPc derivatives.

2.5.2.2 Aryloxy- and alkyloxy-bridged subphthalocyanine dimers. 
By far, reaction between SubPc-Cl species and an excess of phenols in refluxing toluene or other high-boiling aromatic solvents has been the most recurrent way to prepare multicomponent SubPc-based systems in which a SubPc is axially linked to other unit(s). As mentioned in Section 2.2.1.1, this procedure requests an excess of phenol, therefore, the preparation of dimers or trimers from benzene-diols or benzene-triols turns out more challenging than it looks at first glance. One strategy for the preparation of these derivatives consists in the one-step reaction of the hydroxylated unit with the chlorinated SubPc precursors, which directly affords the target product (Table 4, method A). An alternative approach involves the formation of a 1:1 intermediate featuring one SubPc unit linked to the nucleophile through one of the OH functionalities, and the subsequent reaction of the remaining unreacted hydroxyl group with other SubPc units (method B, Table 4).

The one-step pathway (method A, Table 4) was employed by Çoşut et al. for the synthesis of hexameric or octameric SubPc-based systems upon reaction of SubPc-Cl with hexa- or octa(p-hydroxyphenoxy)cyclotriphosphazene in refluxing toluene.95,275 The emission bands of these compounds are bathochromically shifted with respect to unsubstituted SubPc-Cl due to the close proximity of the SubPc units, which favours π–π interactions between them.
In 2015, Shibata and co-workers reported a peripherally trifluoroethoxy (TFEO)-substituted SubPc homodimer featuring a o-, m-, or p-hydroquinone linker (24o, 24m, 24p, Fig. 9) prepared through reaction of an excess of (TFEO)12SubPc-Cl precursor with o-, m- or p-dihydroxyphenol in refluxing toluene in the presence of TEA (method A, Table 4).70 Remarkably, no reaction was observed employing H12SubPc-Cl as starting material. On the other hand, the preparation of H12SubPc and F12SubPc homodimers 25 and 26, as well as the synthesis of H12SubPc-F12SubPc heterodimer 27, were performed by a two-step procedure which involved first, the preparation of a SubPc-hydroquinone (SubPc-Hq) derivative and then, a second reaction in a pressure vessel using a 1:1 mixture of SubPc-Cl and the corresponding SubPc-Hq derivative in toluene at 180 °C for three days (method B, Table 4).94
Analogous heterodimers featuring a TFEO-substituted SubPc unit and a H12SubPc or a F12SubPc unit (28–29) and (TFEO)12SubPc-H12SubPc-F12SubPc trimer 30 were also prepared through a multi-step approach (Scheme 14).70,73 In these cases, the hydroquinone- or phloroglucinol functionalized (TFEO)12SubPc was sequentially reacted with the corresponding activated triflate derivatives (method C, Table 4), first F12SubPc-OTF (54), which is less reactive, and then 14, formed from H12SubPc-Cl.
 Scheme 14  Stepwise synthesis of SubPc trimer 30 described by Shibata.73 
As a result of the diamagnetic ring currents from the two SubPc units in the dimer, the 1H-NMR resonances of the linking hydroquinone moiety, around 5 ppm, showed considerable upfield shifts, larger than the ones of axial phenoxy substituents in SubPcs. It is also noticeable the sensitivity of hydroquinone bridge resonance to the peripheral substitution of the SubPc components. In the case of the unsymmetrical dimer 27p, the hydroquinone bridge showed two different proton signals as two doublets between 4.83 and 4.73 ppm.
Concerning the absorption properties, the UV-vis spectra showed similar Q band maxima to the SubPc-phenoxy derivatives, and quite different to the corresponding μ-oxo dimers, indicating a low degree of interaction between the SubPc components. Differences caused by the ortho-, meta- and para-hydroquinone substitutions were not observed. In the UV-vis spectra of heterodimers, two absorption peaks, irrespective of the solvent and concentration, were observed in Q band region, suggesting that each SubPc unit absorbs light independently. Fluorescence quantum yields (ΦF) of 0.32 and 0.33, respectively, were calculated for homodimers 24ortho- and para-in dioxane upon excitation at 530 nm. On the other hand, meta-homodimer 24m showed a higher fluorescence quantum yield (ΦF = 0.52) in dioxane, indicating that electronic communication between the SubPc moieties of dimers linked at ortho- and para-positions is stronger than that between the dimers linked at meta positions. In the case of heterodimers 28, their fluorescence decreased significantly in dioxane. In particular, fluorescence peaks at 570 nm are more significant quenched than those around 616 nm, which implies energy/electron transfer from the H-SubPc moiety to the TFEO-SubPc moiety. ΦF values of ortho-linked SubPc dimer 28o displayed a more important decrease, probably implying that, in addition to regular through-bonding electron transfer, a through-space electron transfer process due to the closer proximity of the two electronically different SubPc components takes place.
The 1H-NMR spectra of trimer 30 showed unique peaks at 2.6, 2.8 and 2.9 ppm corresponding to three protons of the central benzene ring which are strongly shielded by the diatropic magnetic currents of the three different SubPc moieties. This suggests an independent absorption of each SubPc component, which is not influenced by their SubPc neighbour. On the other hand, the steady-state fluorescence spectra of trimer 30 show quenched peaks suggesting energy transfer from H12SubPc to F12SubPc via TFEO-substituted SubPc units, and/or directly from the H12SubPc to the F12SubPc units.
SubPc-azobenzene-SubPc 116 and SubPc-Bis(azobenzene)-SubPc 117 are interesting examples of SubPc dimers axially linked by a photoactive unit. They were prepared using method A (Table 4) by treating SubPc-Cl 20 with the corresponding bis-hydroxyazobenzenes.24,127 Single crystals of 116 show the azobenzene moiety is highly planar in a trans configuration. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of triad 117 in DMF shows the standard profile of SubPc absorption spectra: a B band at ca. 300 nm and a Q band in the 550–600 nm region. In addition, a shoulder is observed in the 357 nm region, corresponding to the azobenzene π–π* transition. More interestingly, the photoisomerization of 116 was studied in dilute DMF solutions. Conversion of the trans isomer to a cis rich photostationary state was accomplished through irradiation with a 365 nm light. The cis/trans back reaction occurred upon irradiating in the visible region with a 570 nm laser, indicating that SubPc can act as a light-harvesting unit. In the dark, the isomerization also take place in about two days. The trans/cis photoisomerization process could be followed by monitoring the decrease in the intensity of the shoulder band at 357 nm. Additional evidence for the photoisomerization was obtained by NMR spectroscopy since, in addition to the doublets for the azobenzene unit in the trans isomer at 7.23 and 5.41 ppm, two new doublets are observed at 6.15 and 5.24 ppm, assigned to the corresponding cis isomer when a CDCl3 solution of 116 is irradiated with UV region light (365 nm). As a consequence of a closer proximity of the SubPcs in this cis-isomer, the signals are considerably upfield shifted. Integration of these groups of signals indicates that 25% of triad 116 is in the cis form in the PSS. In the case of triad 117 the conversion of the E,E conformer to a photostationary state that contains the E,Z conformer was accomplished through irradiation at 385 nm.127 As in the previous triad 116, only the main π–π* bis (azobenzene) band of the E,E-isomer loses intensity upon irradiation. Photoisomerization was also inferred from the appearance of a new singlet in the 1H-NMR spectrum, assigned to the central benzene ring of the bis(azobenzene) unit. However, no changes were detected in the terminal phenoxy units, probably due to the longer distance of the bis(azobenzene) bridge. Significantly, an obvious decrease in the fluorescence emission intensity is also observed.
Other SubPc dimers linked through axial positions by bis(aryloxy) groups, prepared by treating SubPc-Cl compounds with different bisphenols, had been previously reported by Bender.276 Recently, the reaction of an axially activated SubPc-OTf (either 14 or 54) and a naphthalenediimide diol, in the presence of a naphthalene-containing crown ether, has been employed for the preparation of the first mechanically interlocked [2]rotaxane containing SubPc stoppers.79
A few SubPc dimers have been prepared by post-functionalization of the axial ligands (method D, Table 4) of more accessible SubPc starting materials bearing alkoxide groups with terminal reactive functional groups, such as alkynes and azides (Scheme 15). The synthesis of SubPc dimers 118 and 119, containing a butadiyne bridge, was based on the palladium-mediated oxidative homocoupling of terminal alkynes.72,138 Besides, SubPc dimer 120, where the two SubPc macrocycles are connected through a triazole ring, was synthesized by azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition of terminally substituted azido 127 and ethynyl SubPc 126 (Scheme 15).138
 Scheme 15  Axially linked SubPc dimers 118–120 prepared by a post-reaction strategy.72,138 
2.5.2.3 Alkynyl-bridged subphthalocyanine dimers. 
The first ethynyl-bridged SubPc dimer 128 was reported by Rapenne and co-workers in 2012. It was prepared in 31% by reaction of SubPc-Cl 20 with 1.7 equiv. of ethynylmagnesium bromide in THF, with microwave heating at 100 °C (method A, Table 5).277 Spectroscopic characterization indicated that interaction between the two SubPc units is negligible. Later on, in 2016, the group of Nielsen reported a milder method allowing the axial functionalization of a SubPc with alkynyl substituents, using TMS-protected alkynyl nucleophiles in the presence of aluminium chloride, at room temperature (method B, Table 5).87 Although a great number of SubPc derivatives have been prepared in the last years through this procedure, the application of this methodology to the preparation of dimeric systems using bis(TMS)-protected dialkynes is more limited. In the original paper, only one example of dimer containing a ferrocene bridge (129) was reported, with poor (i.e., 8%) reaction yield.

More recently, the same group successfully applied this methodology to prepare dimer 130, in which two SubPcs are axially crosswise linked through the geminal positions of a tetraethynylethene (TEE) bridge unit (Scheme 16).75 Key in this synthetic strategy was to play with two slightly different alkyne-protecting groups, namely TMS- and TIPS-, in the TEE starting material, which selectively react at the trimethylsilyl (TMS) end-capped alkyne units under these conditions. SubPc-TEE-SubPc dimer 130 could be used as starting material upon convenient desilylation of its TIPS protecting groups using 10 equiv. of silver(I) fluoride, followed by in situ Sonogashira coupling reaction with different iodo-aryls, giving access to new SubPc-functionalized acetylenic scaffolds. N alternative protocol to the harsh and expensive TIPS deprotection reaction was developed,278 allowing the preparation of SubPc dimer 131 in two steps from SubPc-Cl 20. The latter consisted first, on the introduction of dibromo-enyne unit by the well-established AlCl3-mediated alkynylation using the appropriate TMS-acetylenic derivative for linking the two SubPcs by their axial positions. Then, the vinylic dibromide unit was subjected to Sonogashira coupling with trimethylsilylacetylene to obtain 131 (Scheme 16). Moreover, Glaser–Hay oxidative homocoupling could be successfully applied to the preparation of linear oligoyne-bridged SubPc dimers 133 (butadiynediyl) and 134 (octatetraynediyl), after deprotection of the TMS-protected SubPc derivative.279
 Scheme 16  Synthetic strategies developed by Nielsen for the preparation of alkynyl-bridged SubPc dimers. 
Mixing selective TMS-alkynylation, Sonogashira coupling and Glaser–Hay oxidative coupling in the appropriate sequence, SubPc dimer 132 bearing a larger (TEE-TEE) acetylene bridge was also prepared (Scheme 16).278 The electrochemistry behaviour of all these compounds have been carefully studied by cyclic voltammetry recorded in CH2Cl2 using 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 as counter electrolyte and potentials referenced vs. Fc/Fc+. In general, reductions and oxidations potentials in SubPc dimers linked by a flexible spacer such as 118, show two-electron reductions and oxidations at potentials similar to those of the monomer, suggesting a lack of interactions between the macrocycles. In the case of TEE-bridged SubPc dimer 130 some changes in the redox properties were observed, mainly, sequential oxidation of the two SubPc units at +0.54 V and +0.65 vs. Fc/Fc+, which might indicate that the SubPc units are in close proximity, and experience a Coulomb repulsion.279 On the other hand, the SubPc units of the oligoyne-bridged dimers 133 and 134 are slightly easier to reduce than that of 130 (−1.51 vs. −1.57 V), which can be attributed to the different geometries (linearly-conjugated vs. cross-conjugated bridge separating both SubPcs), but also to a larger degree of stabilization of an unpaired electron on each boron atom of the dianionic structure. In contrast, linear dimers 133 and 134 experience a single two-electron oxidation at + 0.54 V of the two SubPc units rather than two sequential one-electron oxidations observed in 130.
2.5.2.4 Subphthalocyanines incorporated in polymers by their axial position. 
Despite the widespread use of SubPcs in organic electronics as small molecule, and the well-known benefits of polymeric organic materials, only few reports deal with SubPc-containing polymers. In particular, it is noteworthy the work of Bender and Lessard in this field, who described in 2012 the first SubPc incorporated as pendant unit into a random styrene-phenoxy copolymer 135, using a post-polymerization transformation strategy that consist in the displacement of the axial bromide of SubPc-Br 31 by the phenolic side groups in a preformed polymer (Fig. 35).280 Later on, they developed a synthetic route involving the reaction with the carboxylic acid groups of a styrene (S)–acrylic acid (AA) copolymer, obtaining the corresponding SubPc-containing polymer 136281 by TEMPO-mediated polymerization; however, a significant amount of an undesired side product was formed. Fortunately, this problem could be circumvented when styrene was copolymerized with methacrylic acid (MAA), obtaining the corresponding polymer 137145 (Fig. 35) without any side product. Polymer 137 showed similar electrochemical properties, solution-state absorption and photoluminescence characteristics when compared with a SubPc monomer, although the solid-state PL emission of the polymer was excitation wavelength-dependent. Preliminary organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) were fabricated to assess the potential role of the SubPc polymer in organic electronic devices.145 The resulting orange OLED was characterized by having a major emission maximum peak at 592 nm and a turn on voltage of around 3.5 V, which is comparable to other SubPc small molecule-based OLEDs. These devices represent the first published report of solution processed SubPc polymer-containing organic electronic devices.
 Fig. 35  Molecular structure of the SubPc-containing polymers 135–137 developed by Bender and co-workers axially linked to the main chain as pendant groups. 
Considering the importance of thermal annealing processes in organic electronic devices, and the relatively high thermal transition (Tg) of 137, a new polymer (138) was engineered was engineered, incorporating n-butyl methacrylate (BMA) monomers in addition to styrene (S) and methacrylic acid (MAA) monomers.144 However, while the increasing composition of BMA was found to decrease the Tg of the prepolymers, differential scanning calorimetry analysis revealed that the Tg of the final SubPc-containing terpolymers varied only by an insignificant amount, from about 197 to 217 °C, with poly(MAA0.40-SubPc/BMA0.5/S0.10) displaying the lowest Tg, meaning that incorporated SubPc units mainly dictate these transition temperatures. Moreover, solid state fluorescence spectroscopy showed that annealing solid-state films above this temperature causes SubPc aggregation and unusual aggregation-induced dual emission.
Finally, SubPc has been incorporated as terminal group of either α (initiating side) (139) or ω (propagation side) (141) ends of some polymers, such as poly(styrene) and poly(n-butylacrylate), produced by nitroxide mediated polymerization (NMP).143 Whereas 139 (Scheme 17) was prepared by selective coupling of SubPc-Br to the terminal carboxylic acid group at the α-side end of the pre-polymer, 141 has been achieved through the preparation of a SubPc-TEMPO derivative 140, which subsequently reacts with the nitroxide fragment of the preformed polymer yielding 141 (Scheme 17). In both cases, the incorporation of the SubPc chromophore was confirmed using a photodiode array detector connected in line with a gel permeation chromatography (GPC) setup.

2.5.3 Peripherally linked “all-SubPc” systems. 
2.5.3.1 Non-conjugated subphthalocyanine dimers. 
Binuclear SubPcs have been prepared by double cyclotrimerization of a bis(phthalonitrile) precursor aiming to double the absorption properties of these chromophores. In particular, a 4,4′-bis(phenoxy) bridge was used to link two phthalonitrile units by their 4-position making use of the easy ipso substitution reaction of 4-nitrophthalonitrile by phenols. Mixed cyclotrimerization of the corresponding bis(phthalonitrile) and 1,2-dicyanobenzene in the presence of BBr3, followed by substitution with different 4-substituted phenols led to a series of binuclear SubPcs 142131 (Table 6) that were tested as catalysts in lithium/thionyl chloride (Li/SOCl2) batteries, observing a significant increase of the stored energy and the capacity of the batteries whose electrolytes contain these SubPc derivatives.

2.5.3.2 Conjugated subphthalocyanine dimers. 
SubPcs have also been connected through a peripheral butadiynediyl bridge by Glaser–Hay dimerization of the corresponding trimethylsilyl-functionalized SubPc precursor. Protodesilylation with an excess of AgF followed by dimerization reaction in the presence of CuCl and TMEDA in an open flask gave 143 (Table 6) in a good yield at room temperature, and slightly higher yield when performed at 40 °C.279 SubPc dimer 143 was obtained as a diastereomeric mixture of a meso form and a pair of enantiomers, which could not be separated by column chromatography and were non-distinguishable by NMR spectroscopic analysis. As expected, dimer 143 exhibits a redshifted Q-absorption maximum at 593 nm, in line with the extended π-conjugated system.
Two SubPc units were connected to 1,2-diethynylbenzene by Sonogashira coupling with monoiodo-SubPc using the previously optimized Pd2dba3/AsPh3/CuI reaction conditions, affording SubPc dimer 144 (Table 6) in good yield.172 Since the starting chiral iodoSubPc consisted on a racemic mixture, the corresponding dimer 144 was obtained as a mixture of meso and racemic diastereomers, that could be separated by column chromatography and assigned by chiral HPLC (while the racemic gave two peaks the meso diastereomers gave only one).
2.5.3.3 Conjugated subphthalocyanine cyclic oligomers. 
Considering the sensitivity of the SubPc macrocycle towards nucleophiles and the restricted chemistry that this peculiar macrocycle allows in general, palladium-mediated coupling reactions have been the best tool that SubPc chemist handled for the preparation of multicomponent SubPc based systems. Monoiodo-SubPc derivatives are by far the most used starting materials for performing these chemical transformations. In contrast, ortho-diiodoSubPc has been scarcely employed in the preparation of multicomponent systems. Two beautiful examples of SubPcs incorporated into conjugated cyclic polyacetylenic frameworks 145 and 146 have been described so far. Such arrays aim at both increasing the absorption properties and extending the chromophore conjugation, with a consequent shifting of the visible absorption bands to the infrared or near-infrared regions.
The first report by Torres and co-workers consisted on the preparation of a dehydro[18]annulene fused SubPc trimers 145 (Table 6) by a palladium-mediated homocoupling of the corresponding ortho-diethynyl-substituted SubPcs.282 Optimization of the reaction conditions led the PdCl2(PPh3)2/CuI/DABCO/I2 catalytic system. Compounds 145 were obtained as a mixture of two topoisomers that could not be separated, one with all SubPc units facing the same direction, and another with one of the SubPc moieties facing the opposite direction. In a more recent example, a conjugated SubPc dimer 146 sharing a conjugated cyclic bridge was published by the group of Nielsen (Table 6).53 The two SubPc units were fused to the radiaannulene core with 10% yield by a four-fold Sonogashira coupling of ortho-diiodoSubPc and the bis(triisopropylsilyl)-protected tetraethynylethene (TEE) monomer, using AsPh3.
The Q band absorption maximum undergoes a progressive bathochromic shift on going from a single-unit SubPc to the fused dehydro[18]annulene trimer 145 by ca. 20 nm per SubPc unit up to 623 nm. The extinction coefficients also increased according to the increasing number of SubPc chromophores. In the case of the radialene fused SubPc dimer 146 the red-shift is even stronger (60 nm compared to that of unsubstituted SubPc up to 621 nm), and it shows a small degree of solvatochromism. Its decrease in fluorescence when increasing the solvent polarity in the heptane, CH2Cl2, MeCN progression suggests quenching via a charge-transfer state. In addition, polyacetylenic scaffolds such as radiaannulenes and dehydroannulenes are molecules with good electron acceptor properties. Indeed, trimer 145 exhibited easier oxidation and reduction processes, by 30 and 50 mV respectively, than the SubPc reference. The radialene 146 is an excellent multi-electron acceptor, exhibiting four closely spaced one-electron reductions at −1.42 V, −1.68 V, −1.92 V and −2.16 V during the negatively going scan, corresponding to the formation of the radical anion, dianion, radical trianion and tetraanion, respectively.
2.5.3.4 Covalent subphthalocyanine-based porous polymeric materials. 
The incorporation of π-conjugated chromophore units into porous organic polymers (POPs) allowed for the implementation of their applications as materials for optoelectronics by combining their porosity with strong light harvesting capability and versatile photophysical and electronic properties. Only very recently, SubPcs have been included as monomers in porous organic materials, either covalent or supramolecularly built.
Very recently, the polymerization of an axially phenoxy-substituted C3-tribromoSubPc 147 and 1,4-diethynylbenzene by a triple Sonogashira coupling in two-dimensions has been reported (Scheme 18).169 An extension of this methodology was applied to the preparation of a 3D-polymer by reaction of tribromo-SubPc 148 bearing a 4-bromophenoxy axial group, that allows extending the porous polymer along the z dimension (Scheme 18). Polymers 149 and 150 were characterized FT-IR spectroscopy, following the disappearance of the C–H terminal alkyne stretching vibrations of the starting 1,4-diethynylbenzene at around 3280 cm−1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated a great thermal stability of the SubPc-containing polymers 149 and 150, with decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) of 314 °C and 276 °C, respectively. However, their powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns showed no diffraction peaks, indicating that they were amorphous. To confirm the porosities of SubPc-polymers the nitrogen gas adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K were measured, suggesting a limited microporous structure in these polymers. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was calculated to be 434 m2 g−1 for 149 and 106 m2 g−1 for 150, respectively. The smaller specific surface area of 150 may be attributed to the congested structures around the SubPc units caused by the axial coupling. Both SubPc-polymers showed a similar pore size distribution (PSD) with dominant pore sizes at 2.8 nm and 3.4 nm, respectively, confirming their mesoporosity. Moreover, they were tested as photosensitizers for singlet oxygen generation. The better singlet oxygen generation ability upon irradiation at 690 nm of SubPc-polymer 149 may be attributed to its more red-shifted light absorption and a larger specific surface area.

2.5.4 Supramolecular subphthalocyanine-containing assemblies. 
2.5.4.1 Metallomolecular assemblies. 
Directional and strong metal–ligand interactions had been the most popular recognition motif for the construction of well-defined supramolecular architectures based on SubPcs. In particular, pyridyl-substituted SubPcs have been employed as building blocks to build different assemblies based on Pd(II)-, Pt(II)- and Zn(II)-pyridine interactions (Fig. 36). The first report by Torres and Claessens in 2002 described the self-assembly of a hollow capsule M3L2 SubPc made of two preorganized tritopic C3-symmetric tri(pyridyl)SubPcs 151 and three Pd(II) ions that coordinate two pyridine ligands each.283 The well-defined internal concave surface of this metallo-supramolecular homodimeric cage made it an ideal vessel for the complexation of convex-shaped C60 and C70 fullerenes.
 Fig. 36  Peripheral- and axially-substituted pyridyl SubPcs employed to build metallosupramolecular assemblies. 
Indeed, upon adapting the internal volume of the SubPc capsule incorporating a rigid alkynyl bridge between the SubPc and the pyridine ligands, cage 158 showed strong interaction with C60 in acetone solution, where C60 itself is insoluble.284 In addition to the two tris(pyridyl) SubPc ligands, each Pd(II) and Pt(II) of cages 158 is coordinated to other secondary ligands, such as diamines (ethylenediamine, en, 158a284 or disphosphines (1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)-propane, dppp, 158b,92 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-ferrocene, dppf, 158c92 or (S)-BINAP), 158d,285 which help to provide additional properties to the cages, such as solubility, redox and chirality (Fig. 37). Systematic complexation studies of C60, C70 and their soluble PCBM derivatives were performed with cages 158b and 158c using different spectroscopic techniques.92 Specifically, titration experiments by 1H and 31P NMR spectroscopy indicated a slow equilibrium on the NMR time scale, which made possible to calculate binding constants by direct integration from the spectra (see Table 7). The values obtained from the 1H-NMR spectra reveal that C70-PCBM forms more stable associates with these SubPc capsules. The lower Ka values obtained with the dppf cage 158c may be a consequence of the rigidity of both the SubPc and the ferrocene ligand, which, when combined, do not easily fulfill the required square-planar geometry of the metal. Moreover, encapsulation studies between metallosupramolecular capsule 158b (M = Pt) and different Pc–C60 fullerene conjugates have been carried out (Fig. 38),286 showing their potential of these cages in the construction of complex photoactive systems based on the combination of supramolecular and covalent binding of SubPcs and Pcs.

All SubPc-based capsules 158a–c possess a plane of symmetry due to chiral self-discrimination during the self-assembling process, which results in the stereoselective formation of a heterochiral capsule containing one M and one P enantiomer (Fig. 39a). However, by using a chiral diphosphine ligand, namely (S)-BINAP, the coordination positions of the Pt metal could be arranged in such a way that the formation of the meso cage was prevented, and for the first time, a homochiral capsule was reported (Fig. 39b).
 Fig. 39  Partial chemical structure of (a) heterochiral meso cage 158b and (b) homochiral cage 158d formed from different secondary ligands. 
A preliminary study of multicomponent self-assembly example through both in situ dynamic covalent imine formation and subsequent coordinative pyridine-Fe(II) linkage has been reported by Torres and co-workers.174 Specifically, the three components, a C3-triamino-substituted SubPc, 2-formylpyridine and a Fe(II) salt were mixed in acetonitrile or DMF and heated at 45 °C for at least 24 h. The formation of a Fe2SubPc3 helicate in the dynamic equilibrium was inferred by mass spectrometry, where peaks corresponding to tetra-charged [Fe2SubPc3]4+ species were detected, thus indicating that only two of the three amino groups attached at each C3-SubPc ligand were involved in the formation of the metallo-organic complex.
Different axially linked SubPc-based metallosupramolecular assemblies have been published based on the coordination of the axial pyridyloxy group of SubPcs 155 and 157 to the central Zn(II) or Ru(II) ion of porphyrins and phthalocyanines.287 More recently, Kimura reported a supramolecular SubPc-Pc dyad to be used in DSSCs, based on the coordination of the peripheral pyridine substituents of SubPc 154 to the central Zn(II) cation of typically bulky Pc-COOH. 154 displayed panchromatic absorption through complementary light harvesting by the SubPc unit, which is transferred to the Pc by a FRET mechanism.113 The formation of the complexes between SubPc 154 and a model Pc compound was monitored by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, determining high stability constants, namely 14 × 104 M−1 in toluene.
Moreover, coordinating the 3-pyridiloxy axial substituent of SubPc 156 to the Zn metal center of a Pc–corrole conjugate allowed to self-assemble the first example of an array composed of three different porphyrinoids, which drives a cascade of energy and charge-transfer processes.81
2.5.4.2 Subphthalocyanine–fullerene complexes. 
The use of C60 derivatives as electron acceptors in most organic photovoltaic devices, and the importance of controlling the contact between donors and acceptors to facilitate the electron transfer between them, has pushed forward the search of fullerene receptors during the last years. Among them, π-conjugated curved molecules such as corannulene or SubPcs have been proposed as ideal molecules to bind complementary spherically shaped fullerene guests, as a result of concave–convex intermolecular interactions. Since fullerenes are scarcely polar molecules, the electrostatic interactions with the receptor might be negligible, therefore the contact area between host and guest should be maximized to enhance dispersion forces, in most cases exploiting π–π interactions. In order to obtain efficient OPVs, not only a good complexation has to be ensured, but also some electronic matching is needed to favour the electron transfer process. The bowl-shaped geometry of SubPc provides the best topology for noncovalent π–π complex formation with the curved surfaces of C60 and C70 fullerenes. Computational studies indicate that the closest contact between C60 and SubPc is 3.20 Å with the SubPc five-membered rings. In contrast, C70 enables two types of interactions with the SubPc receptor, namely, through its polar region, or by the equatorial region, the latter being more favorable, since C70 exposes a larger area maximizing close contacts.288 These calculations also predicted the higher stability of the 2:1 SubPc/C60 complexes. Indeed, SubPc and fullerene heterolayers have been successfully incorporated as donor–acceptor components in organic heterojunction photovoltaic devices. In the case of endohedral fullerenes, encapsulation is predicted to occur preferentially by the face without contacts with the inner cluster in the case of Sc3N@C80 and over the face of fullerene next to the scandium atoms for Sc3N@C80.289
Some X-ray crystal structures of SubPc/C60 complexes have been reported in the solid state favouring either the 1:1 or the 1:2 stoichiometry, depending on the axial and peripheral substituents (see Section 2.4.1.2). Nevertheless, interactions between SubPc receptors and C60 fullerene in solution remain unexplored to a large extent, remaining unclear if such interactions are strong enough in solution to affect spectroscopic properties of the noncovalent donor–acceptor assemblies. Experimental studies by Torres and co-workers on the complexation of different fullerenes by cone-shaped SubPc molecules bearing different type of peripheral substituents have shown that shape complementarity alone is not enough for the formation of strong complexes between SubPcs and fullerenes.290 Additionally, structural factors such as the electronic nature of the SubPc (which is modulated by the peripheral substituents) and the incorporation of peripheral medium-sized alkyl chains seem to play an important role in the binding process, influencing both the stoichiometry and strength of the complexes formed with C60 and C70 in solution. Accordingly, while perfluorinated, electron-deficient SubPc does not interact appreciably with fullerenes, unsubstituted SubPc forms weak 1:1 complexes and electron-donating hexalkylthio-substituted SubPc derivatives render jellyfish like 2:1 complexes with C60 (or C70) with binding constants as large as 105 M−1 (Fig. 40a). In line with these results, Nemykin carried out a detailed complexation study using unsubstituted SubPc, SubNc, and more interestingly, SubPc 160 bearing electron-donor α-(hexathiophenyl) groups (Fig. 40b).184 Only the electron-rich SubPc 160 showed spectroscopic changes during the UV-vis and steady-state fluorescence titration experiments, indicative of a stronger interaction with C60 and C70 fullerenes. In particular, a new weak charge-transfer band in the NIR region centered at 678 nm (C60) and 676 (C70) was observed during the titrations. More recently, preorganized tweezer SubPc-based dimeric receptors have been reported by Nielsen and Torres (Fig. 40c and d).58,172 The design of receptor 99 is quite elaborated and gather the previous experience in fullerene complexation as it contains two octaalkylsubstituted SubPcs attached through rigid ethynyl spacers to a rigid platform, which is the syn-topoisomer of a SubPc fused dimer, molding a well-defined cavity. Moreover, axial substitution at the two complexing SubPc monomers with a bulky 4-tert-butylphenoxy group was envisioned to enforce the desired face-to-face conformer suitable for fullerene complexation. Stronger interactions with C60 and C70 in both cases allowed to determine by NMR titration and Job plot analysis association constants in toluene in the order of 103 M−1 for receptor 161 and values of Ka of 105 M−1 for 99, as inferred from UV-vis absorption and fluorescence titrations.

2.5.4.3 Supramolecular subphthalocyanine-based porous polymeric materials. 
McGrier et al. reported in 2017 the first SubPc-based porous organic polymeric frameworks (SubPc-POPs 162 and 163) incorporating SubPc and 1,4-diboronic acid monomers (Fig. 41). It was based on the reaction between hexahydroxy-SubPc and 1,4-benzene diboronic acid in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of dioxane and mesitylene at 105 °C for three days.120 Both the choice of the reaction solvent, temperature and the substitution of the axial chlorine atom by a phenoxy substituent were crucial factors for the success of this process. The POP-SubPc derivatives 162 and 163 were characterized by different techniques. The FT-IR spectra of SubPc-POPs 162 display the characteristic CN stretching of the SubPc monomer at 1465–1468 cm−1, and the B–O stretching of the axial ligands at 1046–1039 cm−1. In addition, the B–O stretching modes at 1347–1352 cm−1 are indicative of the boronate ester linkages. Most importantly, the permanent porosities of the SubPc-POPs were evaluated by nitrogen gas adsorption isotherms at 77 K. Application of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) model over the low-pressure region provided surface areas of 231 and 93 m2 g−1 for SubPc-POP 162 and 163, respectively. Nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) was used to estimate the pore size distributions of SubPc-POPs 162 and 163 yielding values of 1.7 and 1.5 nm, respectively, which is indicative of the microporosity of the materials. However, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis of the SubPc-POPs revealed amorphous materials with no apparent long-range. Authors claim this disorder to be related to the large size of the axial phenoxy substituents, preventing the monomers from forming the desired concave-to-ligand stacking interactions. In contrast to the monomers in solution, fluorescence of SubPc-POPs was fully quenched in the solid-state, most probably due to the formation of disordered J-aggregates.
 Fig. 41  Supramolecular SubPc-based polymers. 
The introduction of terpyridine peripheral substituents in SubPcs allowed the formation of metallo-supramolecular polymers using a transition metal as linker. Tris(terpyridyl)SubPc was treated with Fe(BF4)2 forming the Fe(II) metallo-supramolecular polymer (poly-SubPc–Fe 164) bearing a polyisobutylene at the axial position for enhanced solubility and film formation (Fig. 41).15 The polymer was designed to present electrochromic properties, therefore spectroelectrochemical measurements were performed by monitoring the in situ changes in absorption spectra of polySubPc-Fe 164 upon applying potential ranging from 0.0 to 1.6 V. A gradual decrease in the absorbance peak at 580 nm with simultaneous slight increase in the absorbance at 390 nm was observed, so that at 1.6 V, the absorbance band at 580 nm was completely quenched. The electrochromic behaviour of the poly-SubPc–Fe film was mainly attributed to the oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) at 1.6 V, which prevented the MLCT from Fe to the SubPc ligand, causing discoloration. The MLCT was regained by the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) at 1.0 V, recovering the blue colour of the film. The results showed that the oxidative stability of the poly-SubPc–Fe 164 film is exceptionally good for up to 1000 cycles. In addition, switching times required for transition to bleached and coloured states were relatively short, 8.5 and 4.0 s, respectively. Finally, the coloration efficiency (CE) of poly-SubPc–Fe 164, which is the important parameter representing the quality of electrochromic devices, was calculated to be as high as 325.3 cm2 C−1.
Moreover, a SubPc-based 3D covalent organic framework (COF) capable of forming cocrystals with fullerene (C60) has been simulated by plane-wave density functional theory as a promising next generation photovoltaic material. The results showed that there is a driving force of 0.27 eV for exciton charge transfer to the pocket-bound fullerenes. Charge separation could then occur at the COF–C60 interface, followed by the transfer of the free electron to the nanowire of C60 acceptors with a driving force of 0.20 eV.241

2.6 Subphthalocyanine-containing donor–acceptor systems
The need to deeply understand and control the primary events taking place in natural photosynthesis prompted the construction of a plethora of artificial, nature-mimicking photosynthetic systems with the ultimate aim of converting solar light into other forms of energy, such as chemical or electrical energy.291–297 In this context, much attention has been focused on the study and optimization of the factors that govern the efficiency of photoinduced energy and electron transfer processes as well as their mutual interplay. For this purpose, several donor–acceptor (D–A) models have been reported over the past decades. For the preparation of such multicomponent ensembles, a plethora of molecular building blocks have been employed, such as porphyrinoids and fullerenes to cite a couple.298–303
From the seminal work of Torres, Guldi and Echegoyen,304 SubPcs have proven to be outstanding candidates for the preparation of valuable energy/electron D–A synthetic models. A detailed overview of the SubPc-based D–A systems published in the first decade after this first report has been presented by some of us in 2014.1 The reason of the great suitability of SubPc chromophores as components of D–A hybrids relies on their unique structural and optoelectronic properties. As a matter of fact, SubPcs are characterized by strong absorptions in the UV-vis region, with extinction coefficients of the order of ∼50000 M−1 cm−1 and excitation energies above 2.0 eV. Furthermore, they feature intense fluorescence emission characteristics, small Stoke shifts and low reorganizational energies, as well as a rich redox chemistry. Notably, their photophysical and electrochemical properties can be easily tuned upon proper functionalization of the macrocycle, as evidenced in Sections 2.3.5, 2.3.7 and 2.3.8.62 On the other hand, their versatility in terms of chemical modification of the axial and peripheral substituents, as well as their π-conjugate bowl-shaped structure, allow to include these chromophores in a large variety of covalent and supramolecular multicomponent arrays (see Section 2.5).
SubPcs have been employed either as donor or as acceptor moieties in both energy and electron D–A systems. Their role within such multicomponent ensembles can be tailored by modulating the substitution pattern of the SubPc chromophore, the electronic properties of the molecular counterpart, the polarity of the solvent and/or the energy of the photoexciting radiation.

2.6.1 Photoinduced energy transfer in subphthalocyanine-containing donor–acceptor systems. 
By virtue of their outstanding absorption and emission features, SubPcs can act either as energy-donor antennae or energy-acceptor units in photoactive systems. As a consequence of their energetically high-lying singlet excited states, these chromophores commonly play the role of donors in excitation energy transduction events towards fullerenes, Pcs, Ps, SubPc fused dimers, properly functionalized BODIPYs, azaBODIPYs and pentacene dimers, which generally features smaller singlet excited state energies. On the other hand, they usually act as energy acceptors in combination with chromophores with higher singlet excitation energies, such as BODIPYs, polycyclic aromatics or perylenediimides (PDIs). Oligomeric SubPc-based systems in which different SubPc units act as either energy donor or energy acceptor have also been described.305
2.6.1.1 Subphthalocyanines as energy donors. 
SubPcs have been widely exploited as energy donors in large variety of D–A models. Among the molecular counterparts employed in the construction of such SubPc-based energy transfer systems, fullerenes represent the most explored. As a matter of fact, the good spectral matching between the two chromophores along with the multiple functionalization options offered by fullerene derivatives led to the preparation of a wide range of covalent and supramolecular ensembles featuring SubPcs and C60 as respectively energy donor and energy acceptor moieties.
In one of the pioneering works of Torres, Guldi and Echegoyen, energy transfer within a set of SubPc–C60 dyads (165–167, Fig. 42) covalently linked through the axial position of the SubPc macrocycle via phenoxy spacers was reported.304 In these systems, the efficiency of energy transfer toward the fullerene was found to be regulated by the ortho-, meta, or para-substitution pattern of the isomeric bridging unit.202

Control over energy versus electron transfer kinetics in covalently linked SubPc–C60 dyads can be reached through chemical modification of the SubPc unit, as shown some years later by the same authors.197,202 As such, the introduction of proper functionalities at the periphery of the macrocycle allow to tune the energy levels of the species involved in the decay of the SubPc singlet excited state populated upon irradiation. Studies on axially linked SubPc–C60 systems functionalized at the periphery of the macrocycle with iodine, fluorine, catechoxy and triphenylamine substituents (165–172, Fig. 42) pointed out that SubPc singlet energy transduction constitutes the dominating quenching mechanism in the presence of electron-withdrawing peripheral substituents (i.e., for 165–168 in all the investigated solvents and for 169 in non-polar environments).197,202,304 About a decade later, energy transfer to the fullerene unit was shown to be not the only deactivation pathways of photoexcited electron-deficient SubPcs in axially linked SubPc–C60 systems. In particular, in a couple of analogous hybrids (168 and 173, Fig. 42) featuring a C60 moiety connected to the axial position of the macrocycle, the competition between alternative decay mechanisms was regulated by selective population of either the first or the second singlet excited state of the SubPc moiety through control of the excitation wavelength (λex).165 Interestingly, it was observed that while excitation with a lower-energy radiation – which results in exclusive population of the SubPc-centered first singlet excited state – triggers an efficient singlet–singlet energy transfer to the C60 moiety, the generation of the energetically higher lying SubPc second singlet excited state upon irradiation with a lower λex makes electron transfer dominates the deactivation scenario (vide infra). In other words, the energy transfer mechanism is operative as long as the higher lying singlet excited state of the SubPc is not populated. Under this condition, the singlet excited state of the fullerene unit is generated, which undergoes ISC and subsequent triplet–triplet energy transfer to afford the SubPc triplet excited state as final photoproduct. Energy transfer was found to take place also in peripherally connected SubPc–C60 systems, as long as the two units are not strongly electronically coupled.306
Besides in covalently linked hybrids, exciton energy transduction to fullerenes has been studied also in SubPc-based supramolecular assemblies. In 2013, the groups of Guldi and Torres reported the first case of unidirectional energy transfer within SubPc-based non-covalent systems in a series of models featuring a fullerene unit interacting with the concave faces of jellyfish-like hexaalkylthio SubPcs (e.g.159, Fig. 40) through supramolecular interactions.290 Pump probe experiments suggested that upon formation of 2:1 complexes with either C60 or C70, energy transfer to the encapsulated fullerene unit is effective in the decay of the singlet exited states of the outer SubPcs. In the same year, a series of M3L2 SubPc-based capsules forming 1:1 adducts with C60 was reported by the same groups.92 The photophysical characterization of some of these supramolecular systems (158c, d, M = Pd, Fig. 37) revealed that upon photoexcitation of the SubPc an exciton energy transduction scenario is operative, which leads to the population of the singlet excited state of the C60 guest. A sequence of ISC and triplet–triplet energy transfer completes the deactivation cascade, affording as final photoproduct the SubPc-centered triplet excited state.
In most SubPc–fullerene systems undergoing excitation energy transduction, formation of C60 singlet excited state by singlet–singlet energy transfer from the SubPc triggers a cascade of photophysical processes, involving a rate-determining C60-centered ISC to populate the lower-lying C60 triplet excited state and a triplet–triplet excitation energy transduction in which energy is back-transferred to the SubPc. The quenching of the fullerene triplet excited state through the secondary energy transfer event prevents the use of SubPc–fullerene derivatives as triplet state sensitizers. In order to circumvent Dexter-type back energy transfer, direct covalent connection between the two chromophore should be avoided in order to minimize the orbital overlap between the donor and the acceptor, allowing at the same time through-space dipole–dipole interactions at the basis of the Förster-type singlet–singlet energy transfer. With this idea in mind, Sølling and co-workers designed a triad (174, Fig. 43) in which a SubPc and a C60 moiety are connected through a cyanoazulene bridge linked to the axial position of the macrocycle.89 Steady-state and transient spectroscopy measurements along with DFT calculations corroborated that this geometry affords highly efficient Förster-type singlet energy transduction from the SubPc to the fullerene whereas no significant back energy transfer via electron exchange was observed, as expected on the basis of the exponential dependence of the orbital overlap on D–A separation. In light of the aforementioned, a rationalization of the results previously reported by Kim and co-workers in 2008 was proposed.307 In that work, a SubPc–diazobenzene–C60 triad (175, Fig. 43) was presented in which the C60 triplet excited state was detected as final photoproduct in nanosecond transient experiments. Sølling and co-workers underlined the similarity between the role of the cyanoazulene and diazobenzene linkers in the two systems, which prevent electron exchange triplet–triplet energy transfer favouring through-space primary energy transfer.89

Porphyrinoids113,126,195,308–310 have also been employed as energy-accepting counterparts in SubPc-based D–A models.302 In this regard, a supramolecular system was recently reported by Kimura and co-workers, in which excitation energy transfer from a peripherally pyridine-functionalized SubPc (154, Fig. 36) to the interacting ZnPc units was argued to take place on the basis of steady-state fluorescence measurements with an estimated efficiency of 41%.113 Singlet–singlet energy transfer through dipole–dipole interaction was also observed in a SubPc–ZnPor dyad (176, Fig. 44) linked through a phenoxy bridge.126 In this case, a back energy transfer to the SubPc after population of the Por triplet excited state by ISC was inferred from pump–probe experiments. Notably, in an analogous system featuring a free-base Por, fluorescence essays suggested the absence of any interaction between the two chromophores in the excited state.125

Interestingly, singlet–singlet excitation energy transduction was also observed to take place between monomeric SubPcs and SubPc fused dimers. As a matter of fact, the extension of the π-conjugated system in the latter results in a bathochromic shift of the absorption an emission features when compared with monomeric SubPcs. As a result of the spectral matching between the emission of monomeric SubPcs and the absorption of SubPc fused dimers, energy transfer to the extended π-system is feasible. In this connection, the groups of Guldi and Torres reported very recently an intriguing all-SubPc system featuring a SubPc fused dimer covalently linked through axial ethynyl spacers to the periphery of two monomeric SubPc units (99, Fig. 32).58 An initial evidence of excitation energy transfer from the monomer-centered singlet excited state (2.09 eV) to the dimer-centered singlet excited state (1.77 eV) upon selective excitation of the SubPc monomers emerged from steady-state fluorescence experiments, in which a dramatic quenching of the SubPc emission was observed along with an enhancement of the dimer fluorescence. In pump–probe measurements, selective population of the monomers singlet excited states (λex = 550 nm) turned out to trigger an ultrafast and unidirectional energy transfer to the dimer, which kinetic overcame the time resolution limit of the experimental setup. On the other hand, an electron transfer scenario was observed upon photoexcitation of the SubPc dimer moiety (vide infra).
Although the singlet excited state of BODIPY dyes usually lies lower in energy with respect to the singlet excited state of SubPcs, boron dipyrromethene chromophores can be converted into good energy acceptor candidates in SubPc-based D–A systems upon proper functionalization of the pyrrolic rings. As known, the introduction of suitable functionalities in the BODIPY core has the potential to tune to a large extent the excitation energies of these dyes, modulating their energy donor/acceptor behaviour.311 As a matter of fact, the functionalization of the α positions with styryl groups results in a substantial bathochromic shift of the absorption features, turning the spectral matching between SubPc emission and BODIPY absorption rather favorable.98,136,312–314 In this context, two sets of SubPc-BODIPY conjugates (177–181, Fig. 45) differing in the number and in the nature of the styryl units connected to the 3,5-position of the BODIPY dye were recently presented.98,136 In all these derivatives, energy transfer from the photoexcited SubPc was postulated on the basis of the quenching of the SubPc emission band and the increasing of the BODIPY-centered emission, although in neither of these works pump–probe experiments were reported to corroborate the steady-state experimental evidence.

Despite azaBODIPYs constitute a well-known class of BODIPY analogues with significantly red-shifted spectral features, no reports on SubPc-azaBODIPY systems had been published until 2014, when the group of D’Souza presented a D–A model featuring an azaBODIPY unit linked to the axial position of two SubPc moieties (Fig. 46).99 In triad 182, control over the deactivation cascade triggered upon photoexcitation was reached through selective population of the singlet excited state of one of the photoactive moieties as well as by tuning solvent polarity. In particular, when the SubPc units are photoexcited in toluene, dipole–dipole energy transfer dominates over electron-exchange interactions affording the azaBODIPY singlet excited state, which then undergoes charge separation. Upon photoexcitation of the SubPc units in a more polar solvent or selective excitation of the azaBODIPY moiety, an electron transfer scenario is operative (vide infra). A similar photophysical behaviour was observed in the azaBODIPY-based triad 183 (Fig. 46) reported one year later from the same group, where one of the SubPc moieties had been replaced by a C60 unit.109 Also in this case, the operativity of the two competitive decay mechanisms (i.e. energy versus electron transfer) upon photoexcitation of the SubPc was found to be determined by the polarity of the solvent, being singlet–singlet energy transfer to the azaBODIPY chromophore dominating in toluene.

Remarkably, ultrafast and quantitative singlet energy transfer from photoexcited SubPcs has been recently exploited to trigger singlet fission in meta-phenylene tethered pentacene dimers (Pnc2). To this end, the groups of Tykwinski, Torres and Guldi prepared a series of conjugates in which a Pnc2 unit was connected through a carboxylate functionality to the central boron atom of an hydrogenated, a triphenoxy or an hexathiooctyl SubPc (184–186, Fig. 47).78 The comprehensive spectroscopic characterization of these derivatives revealed that upon photoexcitation of the SubPc chromophore, energy is funnelled via dipole–dipole energy transfer to the Pnc2 moiety, which undergoes singlet fission to afford a pair of correlated Pnc2 triplet excited states. As an extension of this work, control over FRET and singlet fission dynamics was reached by means of rational spacer design within a second series of SubPc-Pnc2 derivatives (Fig. 47).82 As a matter of fact, upon tailoring of the length and the flexibility of the molecular bridge connecting the SubPc and the Pnc2 moieties in conjugates 187–190, is was possible to tune the rate of the energy transfer as well as the dynamics of intramolecular singlet fission by a factor of 3.2 and 1.6, respectively.

A peculiar case of SubPc-based hybrid systems is constituted by dyads featuring a photochromic unit connected to the SubPc macrocycle (Fig. 48). Photoisomerization of a dihydroazulene moiety covalently linked to the central boron of a SubPc in 191 was found to have an impact on the fluorescence features of the macrocycle.57 In particular, an almost quantitative quenching of the SubPc emission was observed upon complete conversion of the photochromic moiety to vinylheptafulvene. Excitation energy transduction from the SubPc to the photoswitch moiety was suggested by the authors as a possible rationale on the basis of distance and spectral-matching considerations, although the occurrence of an electron transfer event was not ruled out. An analogous system had been previously reported by Shen and co-workers, featuring a dithienylethene moiety as photochromic unit (192).22 In this case, an energy or electron transfer process was proposed to rationalize the observed fluorescence quenching in steady-state measurements. Nevertheless, it is worth to mention that in both these systems an in-depth photophysical characterization would be needed in order to shed further light on the operative deactivation mechanisms.

2.6.1.2 Subphthalocyanines as energy acceptors. 
Although in energy D–A systems SubPc chromophores have been mainly employed as donors, several examples are known in which these macrocycles act as energy acceptors in the presence of a suitable photoactive counterpart.
In this regard, BODIPYs represent good candidates as energy donor moieties by virtue of their absorption and emission features.139,312 The impact of the substitution pattern of the BODIPY pyrrolic rings on the energy transfer dynamics within SubPc-BODIPY systems has been studied by Çoşut and co-workers, who compared the energy transfer quantum yields and the fluorescence lifetimes for a couple of conjugates (179 and 193, Fig. 45 and 49) featuring respectively a 3,5-ethyl substituted and a 1,3,5,7-methyl substituted BODIPY unit.139 In these systems, the repulsion between the β methyl groups and the linker was deemed to induce a co-planarization of the two dyes in the tetrasubstituted derivative, resulting in a change of the orbital energies of the BODIPY moiety and, in turns, in the enhancement of the energy transfer efficiency. Anyway, it is worth to mention that no transient measurements were presented to corroborate the reported experimental parameters.
 Fig. 49  Chemical structure of SubPc-BODIPY 193 investigated by Çoşut and co-workers. 
Energy transfer to the SubPc macrocycle was inferred also in SubPc-PDI conjugates, but neither quantitative data regarding fluorescence quenching, energy transfer efficiencies or fluorescence lifetimes, nor transient measurements were presented for the investigated derivatives.124 Truxene and pyrene derivatives have also been employed as energy acceptor units in SubPc-based D–A systems.156,157 FRET from an apical tetraphenylethylene moiety has been inferred to justify the aggregation induced emission enhancement observed in SubPc 67 (Fig. 13).119
In addition, it is worth to mention the role of acceptors of SubPcs in triplet–triplet back energy transfer events taking place in several D–A hybrids, among which the most common example are SubPc–fullerene systems (vide supra).89,92,165


2.6.2 Photoinduced electron transfer in subphthalocyanine-containing donor–acceptor systems. 
In the presence of suitable molecular partners, electron transfer events can be triggered upon photoexcitation in SubPc-based D–A models. In these systems, the donor versus acceptor role of the SubPc unit is mainly determined by the electronic features of the macrocycle – which are largely dependent on the nature of the peripheral substituents – as well as by the electrochemical characteristics of the molecular counterpart. Besides the energetics of the components, other factors such as geometric parameters and solvent polarity contribute to determine the kinetics of charge separation (CS) and charge transfer (CT) processes taking place in these ensembles. In this context, a computational study on a series of molecular triads featuring SubPcs as central light harvesting unit was reported by Mikkelsen et al., which was aimed to modulate the sequential electron transfer capability of the heteroarray through optimization of the orbitals energy alignment.315
Beyond multicomponent systems featuring SubPcs in combination with different chromophores, a few all-SubPc conjugates have been presented in which the SubPc macrocycle acts either as electron donor or as electron acceptor depending on the peripheral substitution pattern. For this purpose, proper selection of the ring substituent is crucial in order to tailor the photophysical behaviour of each SubPc unit within the conjugate. In this context, Shibata and co-workers reported in 2015 a series of symmetrical and unsymmetrical SubPc dyads featuring hydrogen, fluoro or trifluoroethoxy (TFEO) substituents at the periphery (Fig. 9).70 In the case of the H12SubPc-TFEO12SubPc heterodimer 28, a substantial quenching of the SubPcs fluorescence was observed, which was attributed by the authors to an intramolecular electron transfer from the hydrogenated moiety to the TFEO-substituted SubPc. The entity of the quenching was found to be dependent on the substitution pattern of the axial hydroquinone linker and was rationalized in terms of through-bond and through-space mechanism. On the other hand, for the F12SubPc-TFEO12SubPc heterodimer 29, a decreasing of the emission intensity was detected only in the presence of an ortho substitution pattern of the bridging unit. In an analogous trimer linked though a 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene bridge presented by the same authors (30, Fig. 9), electron transfer from the hydrogenated SubPc to the fluorinated SubPc unit directly or via a TFEO-SubPc moiety was also inferred.73 Anyway, no pump–probe measurement where reported to corroborate the occurrence of charge transfer or charge separation processes.
Turning to fused SubPc systems, a push–pull heterodimer was presented in 2015 by Zango et al. featuring an electron-rich t-butyl functionalized half and an electron-poor chlorinated half (98, Scheme 12).48 Spectral evidence of formation of a charge transfer polarized state (<1.7 eV) along with an energetically lower-lying delocalized singlet excited state (1.73 eV) came from the detection of a dual emission in steady-state fluorescence measurements, as well as from pump–probe assays in which the transient signatures of both the excited states could be distinguished.
2.6.2.1 Subphthalocyanines as electron donors. 
Fullerenes cover a central role as electron acceptor partners for SubPcs in the construction of D–A systems by virtue of their unique redox and structural properties such as their favorable reduction potentials and their characteristic low reorganization energies, which favour the formation of long lived excited states.301
The photophysical behaviour of axially linked SubPc–C60 dyads undergoing electron transfer events upon photoexcitation has been thoroughly explored by the groups of D’Souza, Echegoyen, Guldi and Torres.93,104,105,107,164,197,202 The rational choice of the ring substituents of the SubPc unit as well as the incorporation of molecular spacers connecting them to the SubPc benzenes or the exploitation of supramolecular interactions involving the peripheral functionalities have been used as strategies to modulate the dynamics of photoinduced electron transfer within such SubPc–C60 derivatives.
The electronic features of the ring substituents are known to influence to a large extent the dominating deactivation mechanism in SubPc–C60 conjugates upon photoexcitation. In particular, in the presence of electron-rich functionalities electron transfer is commonly favoured over energy transfer. As a matter of fact, electron transfer to the fullerene unit has been observed from diphenylamino-substituted SubPcs (170–172, Fig. 42) or catechoxy-substituted SubPcs (169, Fig. 42) in polar environments.197,202 In 2016, a series of novel SubPc–C60 dyads (194–198, Fig. 50) in which the electron-donor character of the SubPc had been enhanced through functionalization of either the α- or the β-positions of the macrocycle with thioaryl substituent was presented by the group of D’Souza.105 In all these derivatives, a fast CS process (kCS = 1.4–6.3 × 1010 s−1) was found to take place after population of the SubPc singlet excited state, as corroborated by pump–probe absorption studies in polar solvents, in which the transient features corresponding to the SubPc˙+ and C60˙− species where detected. As expected for C60-based electroactive systems, the kinetic constant for the subsequent charge recombination (CR) process was found to be one or two order of magnitude lower than that of CS.
 Fig. 50  Chemical structure of the axially linked SubPc–C60 systems 194–198 investigated by D’Souza and co-workers. 
In the same year, a SubPc–C60 system (199, Fig. 51) featuring 4-iodophenoxy substituent at the SubPc periphery was reported, in which electron transfer was disclosed to be the dominant quenching mechanism upon population of either the SubPc or the C60 singlet excited states.107 It is interesting to notice that this deactivation scenario is opposite to that observed when the iodo substituents are directly linked to the SubPc macrocycle (165–167, Fig. 42), as in this case a singlet–singlet energy transfer to the fullerene moiety was detected.197 As proposed by the authors, such a difference in the excited-state photophysical features can be ascribed to the moderately electron-rich character of the phenoxy group in 199, which is in contrast with the electron-withdrawing effect of the directly linked halogen atoms in 165–167.
 Fig. 51  Chemical structure of the axially linked SubPc–C60 systems 199–203 investigated by D’Souza and co-workers. 
The energetics of SubPc–C60 system (and, in turn, electron transfer kinetics) can be modulated also by taking advantage of supramolecular interactions involving the peripheral substituents of the SubPc unit, as described in 2015 by D’Souza and co-workers.164 As an example, π–π stacking interactions between graphene and the SubPc peripheral pyrene moieties in 200 and 201 (Fig. 51) result in enhanced CS and CR kinetics. The acceleration of the electron transfer events taking place in these graphene-decorated hybrids was ascribed to the tuning of the free energy of the processes, even if the contribution of geometric factors and the impact of graphene defects on the excited-state kinetics may also be taken into account.
In D–A systems, a strategy for the generation of long-lived charge separated states consist in the activation of a multistep electron transfer cascade through the rational organization of molecular units with modulated redox potentials. As a result, the generated charges are distanced and CR kinetics are slowed down. This considerations are at the basis of the design of a multicomponent SubPc–C60 system (202, Fig. 51) in which three phenothiazine (PTZ) units are appended to the macrocycle through phenoxy linkers and act as hole transporter.93 Free energy calculations suggested that in this system the primary electron transfer to form (PTZ)3–SubPc˙+–C60˙− and the subsequent hole transfer to form (PTZ)2PTZ˙+–SubPc–C60˙− either from the SubPc or the C60 singlet excited states are both exoergonic.93,104 Femtosecond and nanosecond transient experiments provided spectral proof of the formation of these radical ion species. The estimated rate constants (as large as 5.41 × 10−6 s−1 in benzonitrile and 4.00 × 10−6 s−1 in toluene) and the experimental lifetimes of the final radical ion pair (as large as 185 ns in benzonitrile and 250 ns in toluene) were found to be respectively lower and higher than the ones normally observed in the absence of a hole shifting unit, confirming the effectiveness of the electron transfer cascade for the stabilization of the charge-separated state.105,107 The presence of the phenoxy spacer between the SubPc core and the PTZ units turned out to have a crucial impact on the kinetics of the electron transfer events. In this regard, an analogous system (203, Fig. 51) was presented in which the PTZ moieties were directly connected to the SubPc macrocycle.104 Spectroscopic, electrochemical and computational studies revealed a strong intramolecular electronic interaction between SubPc π-system and PTZ unit. As a result resulting of the delocalization of the HOMO on the whole SubPc-(PTZ)3 unit, the latter act as a single entity in the electron transfer process, leading to the [(PHZ)3-SubPc]˙+–C60˙− charge separation product which subsequently decay to the SubPc-centered triplet excited through a rather fast charge recombination process (kCR = 2.1 or 1.41 × 109 s−1 in benzonitrile and toluene, respectively).
In peripherally linked SubPc–C60 dyads, the nature of the spacer was found to determine the degree of orbital overlap between the SubPc and C60 π-surfaces and, in turn, the deactivation pathway upon photoexcitation, being electron transfer the dominating scenario in shorter-spaced conjugates.306
Evidence of sequential CS and charge shift were found in a SubPc-based supramolecular system recently reported by Guldi and Torres groups featuring an electron-withdrawing SubPc fused dimer functionalized at the axial positions with two monomeric electron-rich alkylthio SubPc units (99, Fig. 32).58 Upon photoexcitation of the dimer moiety, a polarized SubPcMδ+–SubPcDδ− CT state or a ionic SubPcM˙+–SubPcD˙− charge separated state is formed, depending on the polarity of the solvent. If laser irradiation is carried out in presence of either C60 or C70, the primary CT/CS process is followed by a charge shift from the SubPc dimer to the fullerene to afford the SubPcM˙+–C60˙− charge separated state, which undergoes charge recombination to afford the SubPc monomer-centered triplet excited state. Charge migration is driven by the gain in electrostatic energy which results from the decrease of the fullerene–SubPc separation and overcompensate the lower electron-withdrawing character of C60 with respect to the SubPc fused dimer. On the other hand, excitation of the monomeric SubPc units led to an energy transfer deactivation scenario (vide supra).
Electron transfer within supramolecular complexes featuring an electron rich hexathiophenyl-substituted SubPc and C60 (160, Fig. 40) was examined in 2016 by Nemykin and co-workers.184 In this system, signature peaks related to the presence of the C60˙− species were detected in pump–probe measurements. DFT calculations provided additional support to the hypothesis of an electron transfer from the α-substituted thiophenyl SubPc to the fullerene moiety.
1,1,4,4-Tetracyanobuta-1,3-diene (TCBD) has recently emerged as an intriguing photoactive partner for SubPcs. The first report of TCBD-containing D–A systems based on SubPcs was published by the groups of Torres and Guldi in 2017.43 In this work, two SubPc derivatives were presented in which a TCBD–aniline unit was linked to the axial position of the macrocycle (10 and 11, Fig. 6). The electrochemical and photophysical properties of the conjugates were found to be deeply influenced by the nature of the peripheral substituents (i.e. hydrogen or fluorine atoms). In the case of the hydrogenated derivative 10, CT and CS features were evidenced in the ground and in the excited states, respectively. As a matter of fact, steady-state spectroscopic measurements revealed a substantial ground-state CT interaction between the donor π-surface of the macrocycle and the acceptor TCBD moiety, as suggested by the bathochromic shift of the low-energy absorption band – which broadens in polar solvents – as well as by fluorescence emission and excitation assays. On the other hand, pump–probe experiments provided conclusive evidence of electron transfer upon photoexcitation of either the SubPc or the TCBD–aniline ground CT state, which afford the H12SubPc˙+–TCBD˙−–aniline radical ion pair. In this regard, it is worth to underline the ultrafast kinetics of both CS and CR processes, which occurs in the picoseconds timescale, in comparison to the kCS and kCR values normally observed for C60-based systems. For the fluorinated derivative 11, as well as for the precursor SubPc–ethynyl-aniline conjugates, a completely different scenario was observed (vide infra).
As an extension of this work, and with the aim to investigate the effect of the anchoring position of the TCBD–aniline moieties to the SubPc on the electrochemical and photophysical characteristics of the system, two SubPc-based conjugates were studied featuring three or four TCBD–aniline units at the peripheral or axial and peripheral positions of the macrocycle (12 and 13, Fig. 6).46 The synthesis of 12 had previously been published by Nielsen and co-workers, although in this case neither the electrochemical characterization nor an in-depth photophysical study of the system was reported.55 In 12 and 13, the ground-state electronic communication between the SubPc macrocycle and the electron-withdrawing TCBD moieties gives rise to a bathocromic shift and a broadening of the Q-band absorption as well as to an additional low energy transition in the NIR region which intensity is significantly enhanced for the four-substituted derivative. On the contrary, electronic dynamics in the excited state differ from that observed for the axial derivatives 10 and 11.43 Interestingly, the deactivation cascade triggered by excitation of the SubPc moiety is determined by the substitution pattern of the SubPc chromophore. In the peripherally substituted derivative 12, a polarized state (i.e. (SubPcδ+–[(TCBD–aniline)3]δ−)* is formed through CT upon photoexcitation of the SubPc, which directly decays to the ground state. When an additional TCBD–aniline unit is linked to axial position of the macrocycle (13), evidence of generation of a fully charge separated state (i.e., SubPc˙+–[(TCBD–aniline)4]˙−) were detected. Such a radical ion pair state is formed either by deactivation of the CT *(SubPcδ+–[(TCBD–aniline)3]δ− transient species (in less polar solvents) or directly by deactivation of SubPc singlet excited state (in more polar solvents). The stabilization of the charge separated species in 13 can be ascribed to the orbital distribution of the system, which features a nodal plane passing through the boron atom that determines the decoupling between the axial ligand and the SubPc ring.
Other SubPc-based systems featuring a TCBD–Fc unit linked to either the axial or the peripheral position of the macrocycle were prepared by the group of Nielsen, and their steady-state photophysical and electrochemical properties were probed (57–58, Fig. 11 and 204, Fig. 52).56 The new optical and electronic features observed upon incorporation of the TCBD–Fc moieties were ascribed to a ground-state electronic communication between donor and acceptor moieties within the systems. Anyway, a comprehensive spectroscopic study of the electronic interactions in the excited state was not reported.

azaBODIPYs can also act as electron acceptor in SubPc-based D–A systems, as demonstrated by D’Souza and co-workers.99,109 In triad 182 (Fig. 46), featuring two SubPc units covalently linked through the axial position to the α-phenoxy substituents of an aza-BODIPY moiety, the formation of a (SubPc)SubPc˙+–azaBODIPY˙− charge separated state was observed upon population of the azaBODIPY singlet excited state either by direct photoexcitation or by energy transfer from the photoexcited SubPc in toluene (vide supra), as well as from deactivation of the SubPc singlet excited state unit in more polar solvents. A similar dependence of the excited SubPc behaviour on solvent polarity was observed in the SubPc–azaBODIPY–C60 triad 183 (Fig. 46) reported from the same group, in which the shift from apolar solvents (i.e. toluene) to polar solvents (i.e. benzonitrile or THF) makes electron transfer to dominates over energy transfer, affording the SubPc˙+–ADP–C60˙− and SubPc˙+–ADP˙−–C60 radical ion pairs by respectively through-space and trough-bond electron transfer (vide supra).109
Electron transfer to naphthalene- or perylene-diimides has also been reported.316,317
Evidence of electron transfer was also reported for a fused SubPc–porphyrin hybrid fused through a quinoxaline bridge (101, Fig. 33).188 Theoretical calculations of the HOMO and LUMO distribution in the fused system suggested an intramolecular charge transfer from both the SubPc and the porphyrin moiety to the quinoxaline unit. The electronic interactions within the conjugate were confirmed by steady-state and transient spectroscopic measurements. As a matter of fact, a solvatochromic behaviour of the emission band was detected along with and a two-component decay profile, which was rationalized in terms of charge separation and charge recombination processes.
Finally, electron transfer in the solid state was studied by Lopez and co-workers in co-crystals of C60 and 3D covalent organic frameworks (COF) based of SubPcs, in which a driving force of 2.7 eV for CT from the SubPc-based electron donating scaffold to the fullerene at the COF–C60 interface was calculated.241
2.6.2.2 Subphthalocyanines as electron acceptors. 
A number of electron rich counterparts have been used for the construction of D–A systems in which SubPc exhibits electron acceptor features. Among them, ferrocene represents one of the most exploited building blocks, after the seminal work200 reported by the groups of Torres, Echegoyen and Guldi in 2006.318
In this contest, several SubPc–Fc dyads (22, Scheme 6 and 205–212, Fig. 53) have been reported in which the electronic communication between the interacting moieties was tailored through proper design of the linker connecting the central boron atom and the metallocene carbon.80,88,181,199,200,316 A Fc–SubPc–C60 triad has also been presented.319 The presence of an ethynyl spacer between the SubPc and the Fc units in 205 slows down both CT and CR processes in virtue of the increased distance.88 The variation of the kinetic parameters in comparison with similar structures reported earlier bearing a methoxy or an ester spacer (206, 209) was rationalized by the authors on the basis of the different conformational flexibility of the linker.181 When a phenoxy bridge is employed (211), the substitution pattern (i.e. meta or para) of the phenyl ring determines the distance between the electroactive moieties and, in turns, regulate the rate of CS.199 Interestingly, when ferrocene units are covalently linked to the peripheral positions of the macrocycle (213–214, Fig. 54), no evidence of electron transfer can be detected.111 In these systems, the short distance imposed by the peripheral substitution pattern, along with the strong perturbation of the SubPc conjugated electronic systems, turn heavy atom-induced ISC the dominating quenching mechanism over CS, as confirmed by the deactivation kinetics of the Sub singlet excited state and the lack of any charged specie feature in the transient spectra of the investigated species. Electronic communication in the ground state between chromophores was revealed by spectroscopic, electrochemical and theoretical studies also in a series of hydrogenated and fluorinated SubPcs in which the Fc was linked to the axial position through a propanoic or propenoic spacer.80 Nevertheless, no steady state fluorescence or pump–probe experiments were carried out to investigate the excited-state dynamics. The capability of a series of SubPc–Fc dyads to undergo electron transfer as a function of the peripheral substitution pattern of the macrocycle and the nature of the linker was investigated by Mikkelsen and co-workers by means of time-dependent DFT studies, showing a strong dependence of the energy of the Fc-centered HOMO on the molecular structure of the system.320

Porphyrinoids302 have also been employed as electron-donor moieties in both covalent14,76,195,308,321 and supramoleular81,322 SubPc-based systems. In many of these systems, the electron-accepting abilities of the SubPc unit have been enhanced by functionalization of the macrocycle with peripheral electron-withdrawing substituents.14,76,195,308,321 In some of these models, the SubPc acts as final electron acceptor of a cascade of excitation energy transduction and/or electron transfer events, which leads to charge-separated states lifetimes on the orders of nanoseconds or tens of nanoseconds. By virtue of its energetically low-lying LUMO, a perfluorinated SubPc was employed as final acceptor moiety in a panchromatic tetrad (215, Fig. 55) in which a cascade of excitation energy transduction, CS and charge shift events was shown to yield a long-living R2N˙+–Por–Pc–SubPc˙− charge-separated state with a lifetime of 10 ns and 11.2 ns in anisole and benzonitrile, respectively.76 Very recently, the supramolecular interaction between the axial pyridine ligand of a perfluorinated SubPc and the central Zn atom of a Pc moiety was exploited in a couple of porphyrinoids-based triads (216–217, Fig. 56) in which the SubPc unit acts as ultimate electron acceptor of a cascade of electron transfer events triggered upon photoexcitation of the corrole unit.81 In this system, the charge shift from the Pc to the SubPc affords a Corr˙+–Pc–SubPc˙− charge separated state which lifetime is two orders of magnitude higher than the initial Corr˙+–Pc˙−–SubPc˙− radical ion pair. A μ-oxo heterooligomer featuring two SubPc units axially linked to the central phosphorus atom of a tetrabenzotriazacorrole was also reported, but the photophysical features of the triad were not probed in the excited state.69 Finally, the electron D–A characteristics of an amino-Por-SubPc conjugate have been theoretically studied by means of DFT calculations both in the ground and in the excited state.323

Turning to TCBD–aniline SubPc-based systems, electronic interactions both in the ground- and in the excited state were found to be determined by the substitution pattern of the SubPc macrocycle (namely, the anchoring position of the TCBD units) and, in the case of the axially substituted derivatives, by the nature of the peripheral substituents of the SubPc moiety.43,46 In F12SubPc–TCBD–aniline conjugate 11 (Fig. 6), the intramolecular interaction between the aniline fragment and the electron-poor SubPc macrocycle give rise upon photoexcitation in low polar solvents such as toluene to the generation of an exciplex species, namely [(F12SubPc–TCBD)δ−–anilineδ+]*. Evidence for this polarized exciplex state came, among others, from the presence of a broad low-energy emission band in the fluorescence spectrum, which is quenched and bathochromically shifted upon increasing the solvent polarity, as well as transient absorption measurements. On the other hand, in more polar solvents (i.e. benzonitrile), the deactivation of the SubPc singlet excited state leads to the population of the energetically low lying (F12SubPc–TCBD)˙−–aniline˙+ fully charge separated state. The modification of the electronic characteristics of the SubPc by replacement of the peripheral fluorine atoms with hydrogen atoms results in a dramatic change of the photophysical behaviour of the macrocycle, which acts as electron donor towards the axial TCBD unit (vide supra). Focusing on the ethynyl-aniline precursors 218 and 219 (Fig. 57), electron transfer to afford the SubPc˙−–ethynyl-aniline˙+ radical ion was revealed in both the perfluorinated and the hydrogenated derivative in benzonitrile. In toluene, photoexcitation of the SubPc moiety in 219 triggers the population of the F12SubPcδ−–ethynyl-anilineδ+ polarized state, while ISC to the triplet excited state dominates the deactivation of the SubPc singlet excited state in 218. A solvent-dependent behavior in the excited state was revealed also for derivative 220, featuring three peripheral ethynyl-aniline moieties and a phenoxy axial functionality (Fig. 57).46 In this case, no evidence for electron transfer were found in toluene, chlorobenzene and anisole, in which an ISC mechanism is operative upon excitation of the SubPc unit. On the contrary, when shifting to a more polar solvent such as benzonitrile, CS is observed, which leads to the formation of the SubPc˙−–[(ethynyl-aniline)3]˙+ radical ion pair. Turning to the (TCBD–aniline)-substituted derivatives 12 and 13 (Fig. 6), photoinduced electron transfer from the SubPc to the TCBD–aniline moieties was detected as a result of the strong electron-accepting features of the TCBD unit.

In 2017, an axially linked SubPc–pyrene dyad (221, Fig. 58) featuring a para-phenoxy bridge was presented as novel electron D–A system.170 In this conjugate, the formation of a Py˙+–SubPc˙− charge separated state was inferred, which was deemed to decay to the SubPc singlet excited state. Electron transfer upon population of either the pyrene (in polar and apolar solvents) or the SubPc (in apolar solvents) excited states was deducted from the quenching of the dyes emission features within the dyad, the shortened fluorescence lifetime of the SubPc moiety upon linking the pyrene unit, the estimated free energy values and the detection of the SubPc triplet excited state signatures in nanosecond transient measurements. Anyway, femtosecond pump–probe experiments would be desirable to corroborate the formation of a radical ion pair species.

After the early report from the groups of Torres and Guldi, in which an electron-rich phenothiazine (PTZ) was connected for the first time to the axial position of a SubPc,317 the electron-donor features of PTZ moieties were further exploited by D’Souza and co-workers in PTZ–SubPc–C60 multicomponent systems (202 and 203, Fig. 51) in which three phenothiazine units were linked to the periphery of the macrocycle.93,104 When connected through a phenoxy spacer, the PTZ serves as secondary electron donor of a sequential electron transfer cascade, enabling charge distancing by means of hole transfer from the SubPc to the electron-rich PTZ and affording, in turn, charge separated state lifetimes in the range of hundreds of nanoseconds.93 On the other hand, linking the PTZ through a direct N–C bond to the meta positions of the SubPc periphery results in the delocalization of the HOMO over the entire SubPc-(PTZ)3 entity, which acts as electron donor preventing SubPc to serve as secondary electron acceptor (vide supra).104
Interestingly, fullerenes – well-known energy donors and electron acceptors in SubPc-based conjugates- can also act as electron donors towards SubPcs upon tuning the electronic characteristics of both the chromophoric units. In this context, the groups of Torres, Guldi and Akasaka reported in 2015 the study of two couples of conjugates (168, 173 and 222, 223, Fig. 42 and 59) featuring a strong electron accepting SubPc linked through the axial position to a La2@C80 or a C60 moiety.165,166 For the endohedral metallofullerene derivatives, the energetically low-lying (La2@C80)˙+–SubPc˙− charge separate state (1.32 eV and 1.36 eV respectively for 222 and 223) can be easily accessed from the SubPc singlet excited state. In the case of the empty fullerene conjugates, population of the SubPc second singlet excited state (3.4 eV and 3.3 eV for 168 and 173, respectively) is required to generate the higher lying (2.17 eV and 1.95 eV for 168 and 173, respectively) C60˙+–SubPc˙− radical ion pair. On the other hand, upon population of the SubPc first singlet excited state in the SubPc–C60 derivatives, energy transfer to the fullerene is operative (vide supra).

The photophysical properties of SubPcs linked to oligothiophenes,324 polymethine-cyanine325 and extended tetrathiafulvalene units326 have also been investigated, revealing electron transfer events to the SubPc chromophore.

2.7 Applications of subphthalocyanines
Throughout this review, it has been shown how the extraordinary features of SubPcs can be drastically modulated via either axial or peripheral functionalization. This in-depth understanding of the structure-property relationship of SubPc derivatives, together with the control of their organization at the nanometer scale, have enabled their use in a plethora of state-of-the-art fields that range from electronic devices to biomedicine. Thus, the aim of this section is to show the reader the different applications that SubPcs have found and are currently finding in the context of material science. In particular, this section has been divided in three main parts: (1) applications in photovoltaic devices, (2) applications in biochemistry and biology and (3) additional applications.

2.7.1 Applications in photovoltaic devices. 
Over the past few years, organic solar cells (OSCs) have emerged as a prominent alternative to the conventional silicon-based photovoltaic devices. In this connection, SubPcs offer many molecular properties that are especially useful in this field and, importantly, can be applied as both donor and acceptor materials since they present substituent-dependent redox profiles. As a result, SubPcs have been extensively studied in organic photovoltaics (OPV) and currently hold a privileged position among the most employed organic semiconductors.
In this section we will comprehensively describe the most recent and relevant achievement in the preparation of SubPc-containing solar cells. Moreover, the key aspects that govern their efficiency will be discussed. This section is in turn divided according to the architecture configuration (Fig. 60). First, planar-heterojunction (PHJ) and bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) devices will be commented. After these two subsections, which cover the most explored configurations, we will overview their incorporation in tandem architectures (TSCs). Then, some examples of SubPcs as sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and their employment as hole- or electron-transport material (HTM and ETM) in perovskites solar cells (PerSCs) will be commented.

2.7.1.1 Planar-heterojunction (PHJ) solar cells. 
This type of heterojunction represents the simplest device donor–acceptor architecture and has been very useful for establishing the basic principles that govern the performance of SubPcs in solar cells. According to the SubPc role, this subsection has been divided in two parts: (1) SubPcs as donor material, in the context of which the H12SubPc-Cl(20)/C60 couple is the main combination employed, and (2) SubPcs as acceptor material, when fullerene is replaced by a SubPc derivative.
2.7.1.1.1 Subphthalocyanines as donor material. 
In 2006, the groups of Thompson and Forrest showed for the first time the potential of the 20/C60 couple in the field of OSCs.327 They found that this pioneering combination exhibited a more than doubled open-circuit voltage (Voc) compared to the conventional CuPc/C60 device, and afforded a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.1%. This work, together with further reports by the group of Forrest328 and those of Heremans329,330 and Lee,331 set the basis of 20/C60 PHJ-OSCs giving rise to what nowadays is the main activity of many research groups.
As a first approach to optimize these devices, several groups have been directing their investigations to refining the contact interlayers that link the electrodes and the 20/C60 junction. Firstly, the insertion of a hole transport material (HTM) to form an ohmic contact at the anode interface, and to selectively collect holes, has been explored. Among them, transition metal oxides, in particular molybdenum oxide (MoOx), have been widely used due to their deep lying Fermi level and suitable energy alignment with a variety of organic semiconductors.332–337 In addition, it has been found that MoOx also increases the device stability by suppressing undesirable interfacial reactions at SubPc/C60 junction.338 The use of other metal oxides, such as vanadium oxide (V2Ox), have also been reported by Jones and co-workers.339 Remarkably, this oxide outperformed most commonly used ITO, MoOx and PEDOT:PSS materials furnishing a PCE of 2.8%. Further improvements in this line were accomplished by Qiu et al. by employing a solution-processed ammonium heptamolybdate (AHM) layer, which also led to better results than MoOx and PEDOT:PSS affording a PCE of 3.0%.340
Along the same lines, some efforts have been directed to improve the MoOx/SubPc junction by inserting additional functional layers. In 2015 the group of Bernède reported a significant improvement by adding a CuI interlayer as morphology control material.341 AFM experiments revealed a more homogeneous surface morphology of the SubPc films after the insertion of CuI. This order gave rise to an improved hole mobility and PCEs as high as 4.66%. Other materials, such as dinaphthothienothiophene or perylene-tetracarboxylic-dianhydride, have also proven to improve the short circuit current density (Jsc).342 Another interesting example was recently reported by Ye and co-workers by introducing an hexapropyltruxene layer that reduced the exciton quenching at the MoOx/SubPc contact.343
Non-inorganic HTMs have also been documented. In 2018, Golder et al. synthetized three novel derivatives, (1,4-bis(β-cyano-p-bromostyryl)benzene, N-methyl-3-{4-[naphthalen-1-yl(phenyl)amino]phenyl}-4-phenylmaleimide and 2,6-bis(diphenylamino)anthraquinone) and tested their application as anodic buffers. Upon insertion of a 2 nm layer of such molecules, the device power conversion efficiency was improved from 3.98% to 4.92% as a result of the enhanced Jsc, which reached remarkable values as high as 7.11–7.65 mA.344 Interestingly, in this work the authors also demonstrated that a high wide band-gap material is not a requisite for the efficient exciton blocking.
Going one step further, several other investigations have been directed to the insertion of an exciton blocking material (EBM) between the cathode and the acceptor layer to avoid charge recombination losses and the penetration of metal into the active layer. Among them, Bathocuproine (BCP) represent the most studied and efficient EBM in 20/C60 devices.345,346 In the case of SubPcs, rather than employing pristine BCP, the dilution of BCP with C60 has been found to further improve the device performance and lifetime.347 Several other exciton blockings, such as N,N-dicarbazolyl-3,5-benzene,348 buffer layer of bis-(naphthylphenylaminophenyl)fumaronitrile349 or bis-(di(2-fluorophenyl)aminospiro)-fumaronitrile,350 have also proven to be effective by showing remarkable PCEs as high as 5.08, 4.77 or 5.13%, respectively. To a lesser extent, the substitution of the EBM by electron transport materials (ETM) has also been investigated. For instance, it has been shown that a 4-(5-hexylthiophene-2-yl)-2,6-bis(5-trifluoromethyl)thiophen-2-yl)pyridine layer increases the built-in potential and hence the PCE.351 Other cathodic buffers such as tris-(8-hydroxyquinolynato)aluminum (Alq3), indium chloride phthalocyanine,352 or hybrid Ca/Alq3 mixtures have been tested as well.353
More recently, the insertion of a blue-luminescent sensitizer layer has been briefly explored by Zheng and co-workers in order to harvest the short-wavelength photons. Specifically, they found that carbazole derivatives have the suitable UV-vis profile for this purpose and led to a significant PCE enhancements when inserted between MoOx and 20.354,355
Several other studies have been focused on improving the morphology of the anode and cathode, which typically are ITO, and Ag or Al, respectively.356 For instance, Wei and co-workers developed a new transparent anode, composed of nanoporous silver and MoOx, whose efficiency was comparable with that of ITO-based devices (PCE of 3.45%).357 Shortly after, an improved charge collection in 20/C60 devices was achieved by using nanostructured electrodes, instead of the usual planar morphology, which resulted in a gain in the field factor (FF) and PCE.358 Another interesting example was reported by Lo et al. demonstrating that a UV ozone treated ITO/ZnO anode can improve the performance and stability of 20/C60 OSCs.359 The authors suggested that this enhancement is due to a higher work function of such anode and a better SubPc absorption triggered by the light scattering of ITO/ZnO surface. Additional strategies, such as the use of patterned and multilayer electrodes,360,361 metallic nanocavities,362 or ITO treated with O2 plasma363 have also yielded promising results. In addition, other studies have been recently devoted to tuning the work function of ITO by physical or chemical functionalization with Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers or benzenesulfonyl chlorides, respectively.364,365
Turning to another approach, the use of three organic materials in a cascade configuration (ternary solar cells) broadens the absorption range of visible light, resulting in an increase in Jsc and hence in a higher PCE. In this configuration, the SubPc can act as ambipolar interlayer between the donor and the acceptor facilitating the exciton dissociation.366,367 Within this concept, rubrene and tetracene in combination with 20 and C60 were preliminary evaluated by Li et al. Unfortunately, in spite of improved Jsc and Voc, a PCE not higher than 1.9% was found.368 Later, the group of Arango reported an insightful study on a ClAlPc/20/C60 cascade architecture. In this work, the authors demonstrated that Voc does not correlate with the outermost HOMO–LUMO offset and, instead, it is conditioned by the lowest HOMOD–LUMOA energy difference (ΔEDA).369 More recently, the group of Bernède explored the optimal thickness of the SubPc-based ambipolar interlayer in a (E)-bis-1,2-(5,5-dimethyl-(2,2:3,2-terthiophene)vinylene (BSTV)/C60 planar-heterojunction. Thus, for a thickness of 12.5 nm, the authors reached a gratifying PCE of 5.18%. Supported by optical measurements and considering the improved Jsc, they attributed this excellent result to the efficient FRET from BSTV to SubPc.370 Shortly after, a pentacene/20/C60 combination was reported. In this case, the Jsc was found to increase as a result of the FRET from pentacene to SubPc. However, this Jsc values did not compensate the Voc and FF losses and this combination showed a PCE of 2.90%.371
The typically short exciton diffusion length (LD) in PHJ OSCs largely limits the device efficiency. In this sense, Holmes et al. claimed a 40% LD increase by diluting the SubPc donor layer into 1,4-Bis(triphenylsilyl)benzene as a wide-energy-gap host material. Remarkably, the authors achieved a PCE of 4.4%.243 On the basis of this work, the same authors reported in 2015 a PCE of 4.3% using an interesting 20:224 (Fig. 62)/C60 device configuration. In this case, the donor layer consists of a SubPc/SubNc mixture, where 20 is the host material. In contrast to UGH2, in this case the diluting agent (20) also contributes to exciton generation by exciting the donor (224) via FRET.372
Until now we have exclusively outlined the extensive research on the 20/C60 couple. Nevertheless, the donor capability of other SubPcs with different axial or peripheral substitution have been documented. For instance, in 2014 Bender and co-workers demonstrated the donor capability of 78 (Fig. 15) with C60 in a planar heterojunction. The authors reported a modest PCE of 1.49% and a large Voc of ∼1 V, which was remarkably higher than those obtained with other donor materials, such as CuPc (0.44 V) or pentacene (0.30 V).373 Shortly after, Shtein and co-workers studied the impact of axial fluorination. They found that H12SubPc-Cl 20 led to a better PCE (2.85%) in comparison with the fluorinated one (H12SubPc-F; 2.44%). Supported by DFT calculations, the authors attributed this result to the lower HOMO–LUMO band gap of 20 and the different impact of the dipole moment in the polaron pair dissociation.374 In 2015, Bender et al. studied the performance of SubPcs bearing para-substituted aryls (by hydrogen; H12SubPc–Ph, methoxy; H12SubPc–PhOMe or fluorine; H12SubPc–PhF) in a ITO/PEDOT:PSS/aryl-SubPc/C60/BCP/Ag device configuration. Although small variations in Voc and Jsc between the different derivatives were observed, H12SubPc–Ph led to a higher PCE (3.18% vs. 2.70% and 2.66% of H12SubPc–PhOMe and H12SubPc–PhF, respectively) as a result of the higher field factor. To explain these results, it was inferred that H12SubPc–Ph offers a longer exciton diffusion length.141 Later, the same authors characterized the μ-oxo-SubPc 102 in different PHJ photovoltaics devices taking 20 as ref. 274. First, they studied the 102/C60 couple in a simple double-layer device. In spite of presenting a lower HOMO energy than 20, 102 led to lower Voc (0.90 vs. 1.06), and hence lower PCE (2.1% vs. 2.4%). The authors partly attributed this drop to the different surface dipole formed between the SubPc and C60. Further improvement in PCE (2.7%) was achieved by substitution of C60 by C70 in the acceptor layer. This finding was explained considering the increase of Jsc, which arises from the strong absorption of C70 between 450 and 550 nm, and between 600 and 700 nm. Then, a 20/102/C70 cascade device structure was evaluated. Interestingly, all cascade devices showed higher FF and PCE than 20/C70 or 102/C70 devices. Regarding SubPcs with different peripheral substitution, in 2018, the potential of 224 as alternative donor material was explored.375 As will be commented in Section 4.1, 224 is synthetized in combination with alloyed mixtures of Cl-SubNcs which have at least one chlorine atom in the bay position. Thus, Bender et al. assessed the impact of the different degree of chlorination on the performance of SubNc in a ITO/PEDOT:PSS/H18−nClnSubNc-Cl/C70/BCP/Ag configuration. They concluded that the chlorination has a positive effect on the PCE by enhancing both the Voc and FF. Very recently, the same group reported a very insightful work exploring the impact of the SubPc regiochemistry on the photovoltaic performance. Importantly, they observed that β-substitution led to higher Jsc values and thus higher efficiencies than α-substitution.239
On the other hand, as will be discussed in Section 2.7.1.1.2, fullerene derivatives present major issues that avoid their practical use in large-scale OSCs. Consequently, several authors have also explored the combination of 20 with non-fullerene acceptors. For instance, in 2013 Nielsen et al. prepared a device with truxenone derivatives as acceptor material which, despite yielding lower Voc values, outperformed the PC61BM-based ref. 376. After that, Sullivan et al. reported that 20 paired with N-ethyl barbituric acid bithiophene can afford remarkably high Voc values (1.38 V). More interestingly, they found that the Jsc and FF showed a significant improvement in an inverted configuration (ITO/Zr(acac)/EBB/SubPc/NPD:MoOx/Al). In this case, the PCE (2.39%) increased up to values comparable to the corresponding C60 device (3%).377 In parallel, the group of Li and Su studied the effect of inserting a 5 nm interlayer of 20 between MoOx and a C60:TAPC bulk-heterojunction. Interestingly, as a result of the build-in field induced by the MoOx/20 Schottky junction, the PCE was increased by 35.4% compared with the reference cell without SubPc (from PCE of 2.77% to 3.75%).378
Conventional heterojunction OSCs typically involve the deposition of the electron donor layer on top of a transparent anode, with the cathode deposited last. However, inverting the configuration (i.e., acceptor deposited on the transparent electrode) offers several advantages.379 In this configuration, the C60/20 couple has been tested as well and modest PCEs around 2.4% were achieved in the first reports.380,381 More recently, Morris et al. documented an interesting example achieving a higher conversion efficiency with an inverted device (3.31%) than with the common configuration (2.50%). The authors attributed this unusual result to the formation of a C60/ITO Schottky junction and the efficient exciton-blocking at the SubPc/MoOx interface.382
A crucial factor in the commercial viability of OSCs is the outdoor lifetime. In this connection, Bender et al. studied the performance of several SubPcs paired with C60 in a rooftop ambient environment, and found that axial substitution strongly affects the longevity of the devices.383 Although a partial hydrolysis was observed over time, SubPcs were found to be robust materials. Indeed, the degradation mainly arises from the C60 decomposition, which tends to undergo photo-oxidation and photo-oligomerization reactions.384–387 Further studies of the degradation mechanism have been carried out by transient photocurrent techniques (TPC).388
To close this subsection, it should be mentioned that the 20/C60 couple have been also considered as reference heterojunction to develop different device characterization methods and computational models, including the quantification of energy levels and recombination rates by TPC,389 the determination of exciton diffusion length,390,391 the analysis of charge-transfer (CT) kinetics,392 and the characterization of CT complexes at the donor–acceptor interface.169,393–405
2.7.1.1.2 Subphthalocyanines as acceptor material. 
Since the first steps of this fast-growing field, fullerenes have been the dominant acceptor on account of their excellent electronic properties.406 However, these derivatives present intrinsic shortcomings that hinder the production of cost-effective and high-performance devices (e.g., high-cost synthesis, low absorption coefficients in the visible range, limited variability in the energy levels, or morphological instability). As a result, “fullerene-free solar cells” has become a hot topic within the field of OSCs.
In Section 2.3.8, we have seen how SubPcs can exhibit high electronic affinities if peripheral positions are functionalized with electron-withdrawing substituents. On this basis, the group of Torres and Jones took the first steps in the use of SubPcs as acceptor in OSCs by achieving modest but promising PCE of 0.96% and 2.7% using halogenated derivatives (4 and 2, respectively) in combination with several donors.160,407 Another early research on this direction was reported by Verret et al., testing a SubPc dimer 90a as acceptor component, paired with 20 as donor. The red-shifted absorption and improved acceptor properties of 90a resulted in an enhanced photocurrent and high Voc values that gave rise to an outstanding PCE of 4%.408
However, it was not until three years later when the real potential of SubPcs as acceptor materials was demonstrated. In 2014, Cheyns, Torres and co-workers achieved a remarkable PCE of 6.4% using 2 as acceptor material and 224 as donor material.409 In this work, the authors showed that the complementary absorption profiles of this couple, together with the ideal energy alignment of LUMO, increase the photocurrent density without loses in the open-circuit voltage. Moreover, it was found that the integration of diindeno[1,2,3-cd:1′,2′,3′-lm]perylene (DIP) as EBM further improved the photocurrent density. Supported by voltage dependent photoluminescence (PL) and light intensity dependent current density–voltage (J–V) measurements, the authors found that the exciton dissociation at the SubNc/SubPc junction was very effective. As a result, the optimized device displayed excellent Voc, Jsc and FF values giving rise to this outstanding efficiency. One year later, the same group could improve this PCE value to 6.9% for a device using a similar configuration. In this work, the authors systematically tested four different SubPcs as acceptors (2, 4, 225, 226; Fig. 61), in combination with four small-band-gap donor materials. Again, Cl6SubPc-Cl 2 showed the highest efficiency, presenting the optimal energy levels to meet the perfect trade-off between Voc and Jsc.49 It is important to mention that, in addition to 226, several others cyanated SubPcs with potential application as n-type semiconductors in FF-solar cells have been reported.54

Another tremendous step further came when Cnops et al. reported a record-breaking PCE of 8.4% using a ternary mixture of α-sexithiophene (α-6T)/224/20.410 In this milestone work, the SubPc plays a different role. Instead of acceptor material, the SubPc acts as a light-harvesting layer, transferring the excitons to the acceptor one (SubNc) via FRET (Fig. 61) Thus, the exciton dissociation takes place at the α-6T/224 junction following a two-step mechanism. As a result, the three complementary absorbing materials resulted in a quantum efficiency above 75% between 400 and 720 nm, giving rise to excellent Jsc and hence improved PCEs. This study paved the way to the use long-range FRET in SubPc/SubNc systems as a powerful strategy to prepare highly efficient fullerene-free solar cells. A deeper insight in such energy transfer resonance was later provided by Rumbles and Reid using computational calculations.411 It is noteworthy that, years later, the group of Lee demonstrated that, in addition to this energy transfer mechanism, another mechanism contributes to this high PCE. In particular, the authors found that SubPc and SubNc single layers can generate free carriers much more efficiently than typical organic semiconductors upon photoexcitation and behave as efficient ambipolar semiconductors.412,413
After this 8.4% PCE, several authors have been directing their investigations to the characterization of this efficient configuration. For instance, the energy levels of this configuration were carefully characterized by means of UPS, IPES, and XP.414 The authors claimed that the high Voc arises from the formation of different dipoles that shift the energy levels of each component. In an attempt to further improve the efficiency of this combination, Huang and co-workers reported in 2016 the use of MoOx instead of PEDOT:PSS as HTM in this α-6T/244/20 heterojunction.415 However, MoOx was proven less effective and the efficiency was much lower compared to that of Cnops et al. (4.35% vs. 8.4%). Later, Vandewal and co-workers introduced an additional interlayer between α-6T and 224 with the aim of increasing the Voc.416 Interestingly, the insertion of Rubrene, DIP or 72 led to a Voc enhancement, reaching maximum values up to 1.16 V (vs. 0.98 V of the reference device). Based on highly sensitive EQE (sEQE) measurements, the authors attributed this result to the suppression of nonradiative recombination as a consequence of the reduced contact between α-6T and 224. Nevertheless, the integration of such layers difficulted the efficient exciton dissociation giving rise to lower Jsc and PCEs. On the other hand, the stability of this ternary combination has also been evaluated. In spite of its promising efficiency, this cascade devices typically exhibit very short lifetime as a result of the rapid degradation of α-6T and necessitate more research focused on the stability issue.417
Further studies using SubPcs as acceptor have been made by Bender and co-workers. First, they evaluated the influence of the chlorination degree of 224 on the efficiency of α-6T/224 planar heterojunction devices. In accordance with the trend observed when SubPNc acts as donor (see Section 2.7.1.1.1), the more degree of chlorination, the more PCE is achieved (4.32%).418 Turning back to chlorinated SubPcs, this group have also explored the performances of 2, paired this time with tetracene and pentacene as donor materials. Unfortunately, PCEs about 1% were obtained with this combination.182 In another work, the influence of the donor deposition method (in solution or under vacuum) in the device efficiency was evaluated using 20 and 1. In this case, a PCE of 3.86% was obtained for vacuum deposited α-6T/20 heterojunction.419 Moreover, the H12SubPc–Ph and 102 derivatives described in the previous section have also been studied as acceptors, leading to PCEs of 2.89% and 0.37%, respectively.141,274
On the other hand, the deep LUMO energy levels of perchlorinated SubPcs could render these derivatives triplet harvesters of singlet fission materials. However, it should be noted that this deep LUMO energy also results in a decrease of Voc. In this regard, though reaching PCEs lower than 1.4%, Bender and co-workers have established some useful guidelines for the design of this type of solar cells.420
Several other studies using 20 as acceptor in combination with different donors, such as acenes or phthalocyanines, have been reported by the group of Li,368 Pakhomov,421 Bernède422 and Bender.423 Moreover, other less conventional SubPcs, such as thiadiazole SubPzs, have also been studied by Stuzhin and co-workers.424 Additionally, the design of other accepting sulfur-containing SubPcs have been theoretically explored.425,426
Turning to interlayer optimization, alternative cathodic buffers different from BCP have also been investigated in this configuration.427 In 2015, Hancox et al. advanced an inexpensive, low concentration, solution processed zirconium acetylacetonate electron extracting layer. Thus, employing the 20/2 couple, PCEs comparable to those of BCP were obtained both in normal and inverted configurations (2.39% and 2.20%, respectively). On other hand, as described in the preceding section, CuI can improve the surface roughness of SubPc layers. Thus, Pakhomov and co-workers studied the performance of CuI/20 heterojunction, delivering a PCE of about 2%. In this case, CuI not only acts as a morphology control layer but also as donor material.249
The outdoor stability of OSCs with SubPcs acting as acceptor material has also been investigated by the group of Bender.428 To this end, the authors firstly evaluated the PCE loss over time of α-6T/SubPc (bearing –Cl, –OPh or –Ph at the axial position) planar heterojunction devices using different ISOS protocols. It was found that 20 shows the higher stability (needing several days to lose 20% of efficiency). The authors suggested that 20 presents a higher stability against hydrolysis, in comparison with SubPcs bearing –OPh and –Ph. Interestingly, the PCE decrease mainly arises from loses in Jsc and FF, while Voc remains largely unaltered. In a second work, the same authors explored the stability of the α-6T/224/20 trilayer OSCs. Once again, the porphyrinic derivatives showed excellent stability for several days and the PCE loss was mainly due to the degradation of the electrode and/or buffer layers (i.e., ITO/PEDOT:PSS).429
2.7.1.2 Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. 
As an alternative to PHJ and with the aim of lowering the probability of exciton deactivation, the use of blended donor–acceptor mixtures (i.e., bulk-heterojunction) has been extensively investigated. In this configuration, SubPcs derivatives have also been widely applied and, as we will see, have led to outstanding efficiencies as both donor and acceptor material.
2.7.1.2.1 Subphthalocyanines as donor material. 
In 2012, the group of Holmes reported for the first time the use of SubPcs in bulk-heterojunction by evaluating the performance of a vacuum-processed device with an active layer comprising a 20:C70 mixture.430 In this pioneering work, the authors found that the device containing 80 wt% of C70 yielded efficiencies of 5.4% and claimed that the improved electronic characteristics of C70 with respect to C60 are crucial to achieve higher photocurrent densities. Chen and co-workers later showed that the post-annealing of this 20:C70 active layer gives rise to a significant increase of PCE.431 Using SCLC measurements, the authors attributed this enhancement to a more efficient charge collection, hence again in Jsc. To shed light on this, they studied the morphologic change as a function of temperature and observed that, upon higher temperatures, a larger grain size is observed due to the phase separation of SubPc and C70. Further work along the same line was conducted by Williams's group employing C60 instead of C70 as acceptor material.432 In this case, a lower PCE (3%) was found. Additionally, the authors explored the influence of the SubPc:C60 ratio on the performance of the device and observed that a lower donor content (which is the main light absorber) led to a reduction in Jsc and FF as a result of hole trapping and recombination effects. Worth of mention is that, in addition to the enhanced PCEs, SubPc/C70 OSCs typically exhibit higher BHJ-device lifetimes compared to those of C60 owing to its reduced tendency to photodimerization and its shorter exciton lifetime.433
More importantly, this architecture has demonstrated an excellent synergy with wet deposition techniques, which is key for cost-effective production. As explained along this review, SubPcs possess excellent solubility and low tendency to aggregate, and can form high quality thins films via solution processing. As a result, solution processed SubPc-based BHJ devices have been and are being extensively investigated. In this case, the limited solubility of C60(70) forces the use of more soluble derivatives, such as PC61BM. One of the first examples of such devices was reported by Yang and co-workers, by preparing a devices comprising a 224:PC70BM blended mixture.434 After evaluating several fabrication details, such as buffer layers, 224:C70 ratio, or the active layer thickness, the authors documented a PCE of 4% under 1 sun AMG 1.5G irradiation. They also explored the temperature-dependence of the carrier mobilities by determining the PCE at 80 °C. As expected, such mobilities increased and the PCE raised up to 5%. The authors also claimed an improved active layer morphology by device post-annealing, resulting in higher Jsc and FF. As described in Section 2.7.1.1.1, the group of Bender also studied the effect of peripheral chlorination on the performance of these SubNc:PC70BM devices.375 Once again, higher chlorination degrees led to better efficiencies. Ince and co-workers also contributed to this area by testing the performance of SubPcs peripherally functionalized with a variety of donor groups.106 However, despite presenting improved donor properties, the paring of these SubPcs with PCBM gave rise to modest PCE less than 1%. Another example by the group of Bender presented an interesting comparative study between SubPc and Pc (both axially functionalized with n-hexylsilyl oxide) as additives in ternary P3HT:PC60BM devices in order to improve the exciton dissociation.150 However, SubPc showed no improvements.
On the other hand, these SubPc:C60 blended junctions has been very useful to explain some crucial processes operating in BHJ OSCs as well as to design new methods for device characterization.
In connection with the former aspect, Holmes et al. reported an insightful work studying the role of MoOx as HTL and its impact on the different exciton dissociation mechanism.435 The authors explained that the excitons formed within the C60 material may undergo efficient bulk ionization generating photocurrent as a result of the large built-in field created by the MoOx/C60 interface. Another very relevant physical process was deeply studied by the group of Schlenker.436 In this work, the authors studied by means several spectroscopic techniques the kinetic competition between charge separation and triplet formation in SubPc:C60 BHJ, which actually represents a crucial issue since determines the photocurrent and hence the efficiency of SubPc–C60-based OSCs.
Regarding the second aspect, Holmes and co-workers demonstrated a new technique for determining the charge collection efficiency that requires no input from optical field simulations.437 In another work, Yun et al. developed a new method to characterize the energy level alignment and molecular components in a SubPc:C60 BHJ solar cell by means UPS, REELS and IPES spectroscopies. This method, in contrast with traditional techniques, allowed the energy-level determination from each combination ratio by separating each electronic structure from the BHJ spectrum.438 A very important concept related to BHJ solar cells was published by Leo and co-workers. In this pioneering work, the authors demonstrated that just varying the ratio of two SubPc donors (2 and 20) within a device composed of a 2:20:C60 BHJ, can efficiently tune the band structure of the semiconductor material and hence the PCE.439
2.7.1.2.2 Subphthalocyanines as acceptor material. 
Prompted by their success as acceptor in PHJ, SubPcs have also been explored to prepare fullerene-free BHJ-OSCs. In this case, particular attention has been paid to Cl6SubPc-Y derivatives on account of their excellent acceptor properties, energy levels,440 and their high solubility. On this line, the groups of Cooke and Samuel reported the first work by using Cl6SubPc-OPh in combination with three common donor polymers (MEH-PPV, P3HT, and PTB7).101 Thus, with PTB7, respectable PCEs about 3.5% were achieved in standard stack solution BHJ architecture. Analyzing the J–V curve and PL experiments, the authors also explained that losses mainly take place by trap-assisted and geminate recombination. Later, the group of Bender gave further insights into the acceptor properties of such Cl6SubPc-OPh by pairing it with a wide range of reported donor polymers, and compared its performance with that of PC61BM.441 In all cases, SubPc provided lower PCEs than PC61BM and the same trend was found in the electron-donating polymer selection criteria. Only very recently, the same group reported a 3.6% PCE employing 2 as single acceptor. In this work, the authors evaluated several deposition methods and found that a solution mixed PHJ–BHJ configuration led to higher efficiencies.442
In 2017, Torres, Janssen and co-workers documented a record efficiency for solution-deposited SubPc-based solar cells.110 In this work, the authors screened four Cl6SubPcs-Y (2 and 227–229; Fig. 63) bearing different substituent at the axial position in a ITO/ZnO/PTB7-Th: Cl6SubPc-Y/MoOx/Ag device architecture. Interestingly, the less soluble SubPc 2 gave rise to the best results (PCE 4%) showing an excellent photocurrent contribution. However, these devices still suffered from low FF, which is a collective result of low electron mobility, serious bimolecular recombination, and suboptimal BHJ morphology. In an attempt to address these issues, the same authors described later the synthesis and applications of novel and highly soluble SubNc derivatives as acceptor in BHJ. Unfortunately, these SubNc, with –Cl, –F or –SO2C5H12 as peripheral substituents, furnished modest efficiencies of 1%, which was attributed to the low Jsc and FF caused by the imbalanced hole/electron transport and suboptimal heterojunction morphology.443 Further work involving SubNcs as acceptor was conducted by Bender et al., by studying the performance of several arylated SubNcs paired with P3HT as donor. As a result of the poor acceptor properties of these unsubstituted (partially chlorinated) SubNc, PCEs about 0.7% were observed.444
 Fig. 63  Chemical structure of the SubPcs employed as acceptor by Martínez-Díaz, Janssen, Torres and co-workers in ref. 49. 
Apart from peripheral substitution by halogen atoms, another simple and facile strategy to prepare efficient SubPc-based acceptors relies on the covalent pre- or post-functionalization of SubPcs with others well-known acceptor derivatives (NFA). As such acceptors involves large π-conjugated systems, this approach may offer several advantages: (1) improved supramolecular organization arising from the additional π–π interactions, which leads to better charge transport properties, (2) higher electron affinities and red-shifted absorption of the SubPc, and (3) wider range cover of solar spectrum, and hence higher photocurrent densities in the device.
Aromatic diimides derivatives, such as naphthalenediimide (NDI) or perylenediimide (PDI), represent one of the most studied systems within the field of organic n-type semiconductors.445,446 These compounds possess many exciting features including high electron affinities, good charge transport properties, solubility, and excellent thermal and oxidative stability, that makes them promising candidates to solution-processed OSCs. Motivated by these advantages, the research activity of several authors has recently been devoted to the peripheral functionalization of SubPcs with this kind of diimide systems in an attempt to improve their performance in BHJ (Fig. 64).
 Fig. 64  Chemical structure of the diimide-SubPc derivatives used as non-fullerene acceptor in BHJ OSCs. 
The first example in this direction was documented by Hang et al. by reporting the synthesis and device performance of two “star-shaped” acceptors consisting of a SubPc-based core, and three PDIs linked by single bonds or acetylene bridges (230 and 231, respectively) to the peripheral positions (Fig. 64).173 As a consequence of the conjugation with PDIs, these SubPcs cover a wider absorption range since they exhibit the absorption of both a PDI (450–570 nm) and a red-shifted SubPc derivative (570–650 nm). Thus, for the inverted device structure ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:acceptor/MoOx/Al, a remarkable PCE of 4.53% was reached using 230. In contrast, a modest PCE of 1.78% was obtained with 231. The authors attributed these results to the more balanced carrier transport and the better layer morphology of 230 resulting from the twisted molecular structure that prevent aggregation. Further studies relating to these diimide-SubPc systems were recently conducted by the groups of Jiang, He and Wang.447 In their outstanding work, the authors synthetized a PDI-fused SubPc, also called “rylene annulated SubPc” (232), and tested the photovoltaic utility in BHJ holding two different substituent at axial position (Cl- or tBuPhO). Remarkably, the fusion of PDI at the SubPc core caused red-shifts up to 115 nm in the Q-band, resulting in small band-gaps about 1.70 eV. This, together with the strong absorption of PDI moieties from 370–520 nm, result in a significant photocurrent contribution of the acceptor showing a broad EQE from 300 nm to 800 nm. Moreover, as inferred from electrochemical measurement, the acceptor properties of SubPc were also found to improve (LUMO energy of −3.78 eV). Thus, in combination with PBDBT-2F as donor, SubPc 232 with axial chlorine afforded the impressive record efficiency of 7.53%. Another efficient approach on this line was introduced by Cheng and co-workers. In this case, the authors simply functionalized the peripheral position of SubPc and SubNc with three imide groups (Fig. 64), giving rise to 233 and 234. It is important to highlight that the physical properties of these derivatives, and hence their device performance, can be easily tuned by means B-functionalization (SubPc) or N-functionalization (diimide). In the first work, the authors explored the performance of 233 within (ITO)/ZnO/donor:acceptor/MoOx/Ag configuration.448 After optimizing several aspects, such as donor material, additives, or B- and N-substituents, among others, the authors reported PCEs as high as 4.92%. These devices exhibited a broad photoresponse from 300 nm to 700 nm, which stems from the contribution of both donor and acceptor. Moreover, AFM studies revealed a good compatibility with the donor. However, the authors claimed that these triimide-SubPcs display poor stabilities. In an attempt to overcome that issue, shortly after the same authors explored the SubNc homologue. In this case, the improved stability and NIR-absorption of 234 led to an admirable PCE of 6.25% using a similar device architecture.449
In addition, SubPcs functionalized with non-imide-based acceptors have been briefly investigated. For instance, PCEs up to 4.6% and 3.17% have been reported employing SubPcs peripherally functionalized with -(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-3-ylidene) maleonitriles116 and diketopyrrolopyrrole groups, respectively.450
2.7.1.3 Tandem solar cells. 
Tandem configuration (TSCs; Fig. 60c), in which two or more single cells (sub-cells) are stacked in series, has been accepted as a general strategy to increase Voc of OSCs, as well as to harvest a broader range of solar irradiation. Motivated by their success in PHJ and BHJ, several authors have also explored the application of SubPcs in this type of solar cells.
One of the first example of SubPc-based tandem architecture was reported by Cheyns et al. in 2010.451 These authors achieved an encouraging PCE of 5.5% by stacking two sub-cells with a high Voc, composed of 20/C60 and 224/C60 planar heterojunctions. As seen in previous sections, SubPc and SubNc, besides giving rise to high Voc values in combination with C60, present a perfect optical synergy that leads to enhanced Jsc. Thus, using this tandem setup, Voc, Jsc and FF values as high as 1.92 V, 4.3 mA cm−2, and 62%, were reached. Remarkably, the measured efficiency corresponds to a 40% increase compared to the efficiency of the optimal single cells.
A poor current matching between subcells drastically decrease the performance of the tandem device. This is due to the fact that less light is absorbed by the back sub-cell compared to the front one, creating an imbalance in the photocurrent generated. With the aim of improving the absorption of the back sub-cell, Feng and co-workers reported a very interesting work using the so-called surface plasmon polariton (SPP) induced field enhancement, which has proven successful to improve the absorption in OSCs without increasing the thickness of the active layers.452 Thus, for two identical SubPc/C60 subcells, the authors claimed a 10.4% enhancement in the photocurrent by using periodical corrugation in the metal cathode. The resulting device showed an excellent PCE of 6.1%. Related to this, the group of Kim demonstrated using numerical simulations that the use of a microcavity structure with a capping layer can also enhance the absorption, and hence the Jsc.453
Later, the groups of Jones and Sullivan claimed a better current balancing by incorporating a N,N′-bis(1-naphthyl)-N,N′-diphenyl-1,1′-biphenyl-4,4′-diamine:MoOx mixture as hole transporting optical spacer layer between 20/C60 sub-cells. Interestingly, the small amount of MoOx shift the Fermi level of the film ensuring a good energy alignment. The excellent conductivity and transparence of such interlayer led to a significant photocurrent increase, raising the efficiency by ∼80% (PCE of 4.2%). EQE measurements showed that the increase in absorption in the SubPc region was the cause for the improved photocurrent balancing.454
Several other studies have been directed to find new donor couples. Along this line, in 2014 Xue and co-workers documented a TSC with a remarkable spectral response spanning from 300 nm to 1000 nm. In this case, PbPc and 20 were the donors of the front and back sub-cells, respectively. In both sub-cells C60 is the acceptor component. After a detailed study of the individual sub-cells, the authors found that the C60 layer thickness has a critical impact on the photocurrent generation of the tandem device. With this issue optimized, the authors achieved a respectable PCE of 4.5%.455
Other important work in this area includes that of Pakhomov and Travkin, who presented the performance of all-phthalocyaninic-dye-based TSCs. By these simple architectures and optimizing each single junction sub-cell separately, the authors explored the impact of different factors (i.e., interconnecting layer composition, buffers, or layer thicknesses) on the Voc of both each sub-cell and the whole tandem device.456–458
Zhang and co-workers also studied the composition of the interconnecting layer, also referred as charge recombination zone, by connecting in a tandem mode 20/C60 and ClAlPc/C60 planar heterojunctions.459 Specifically, the authors compared the efficiency of BCP and 3,4,9,10 perylenetetracarboxylic bisbenzimidazole as electron transporting layer, and evaluated the role of Ag layer thickness on the device performance. Concerning the former, they found that, despite BCP exhibited higher Voc, PTCBI showed a greater energy level alignment and much smoother surface, giving rise to an efficient ohmic contact with Ag and hence higher FF and PCE (51% and 3.49%, respectively). On the other hand, it was found that a very thin Ag layer further improves the interface morphology, presents an excellent transparence, and enhances the absorption of C60 by SPP effects.
Alternatively, bulk-heterojunction has also been considered for the preparation of SubPc-based tandem architectures. Indeed, in 2014, Jin and co-workers stablished the record efficiency of this section by reporting an impressive 7.66%, obtained by simply stacking two identical 20:C70 sub-cells linked by a highly transparent MoOx/F16CuPc/Ag/BPhen layer (Fig. 65).460 This success mainly arises from this particular ICL, where the F16CuPc plays a crucial role promoting the extraction of holes and carrier recombination, and extending the recombination zone. As a consequence, the resulting device present and excellent current matching and Voc values as high as 2 V, which almost correspond to the sum of the Voc of each sub-cell, pointing out once again to an excellent current balance. Remarkably, the tandem device largely outperformed the individual cells, which reached PCE values of 5.5%.

Apart from being used as donor, SubPc 20 has also proven to be very efficient as additional interlayer between the hole transporting material and the active bulk-heterojunction.461 In this sense, Gao et al. documented PCEs as high as 7.27% with the following configuration: ITO/MoO3/SubPc/TAPC:C70/Bphen/Ag/MoO3/SubPc/TAPC:C70/Bphen/Al. The authors attributed this efficiency to the high absorption of C70 and the band bending caused by the inclusion of SubPc that significantly improved the holes extraction. Additionally, in this work the authors proposed an insightfully carrier transport mechanism considering UPS measurements.
2.7.1.4 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC). 
Since the seminal work published by O’Regan and Gräztel in 1991,462 DSSCs have been extensively investigated as a promising cost-effective alternative to the common p–n junction devices. In this configuration, particular attention has been paid to the optimization of the sensitizer. In this sense, although most efforts have been directed to the use planar porphyrinoids sensitizers (e.g., Pors or Pcs), SubPcs have also shown promising results. In 2014, the groups of Torres and Nazeeruddin synthetized five SubPcs bearing different carboxylic acids both at the axial and the peripheral positions, and tested for the first time their performances in DSSCs.47 The authors screened several electrolytes and found that those containing Li+ significantly improved the Jsc. Thus, with the optimized electrolyte in hand (mixture of 0.5 M NaI and 0.5 M LiI), a maximum PCE of 1.32% was obtained using the peripherally functionalized SubPc. In contrast, when the axially substituted SubPcs were tested, PCEs drastically decreased as a result of the poor electronic communication between SubPc orbitals and TiO2 (PCEs of 0.05–0.38%). Importantly, the addition of coadsorbant did not improve the performance owing to the low aggregation tendency of SubPcs. In spite of the low PCEs obtained and the low Jsc values, this work paved the way for further research on SubPc-based.
In an attempt to improve Jsc, the same authors described two years later another set of asymmetric SubPcs holding a carboxylic acid at the periphery.50 Such compounds were tested in DSSCs on [9+4] mm thick TiO2 film (9 mm thick active layer and an additional 4 mm thick scattering layer) and also afforded low PCEs ranging from 0.23% to 0.91%. Supported by electrochemical measurements, the authors concluded that the poor efficiencies of SubPc-based DSSCs mainly arise from the small driving forces for electron injection as a consequence the low-lying LUMO levels of these sensitizers, which significantly limits the Jsc.
Later, Gotfredsen et al. similarly evaluated the efficiency of both liquid- and solid-state DSSCs using a new push–pull SubPc sensitizer consisting of two aniline donor moieties and a benzothiadiazole acceptor moiety. In the case of liquid-state devices, it was found that dyes tend to desorb to the mesoporous TiO2. As consequence, the resulting devices led to a low efficiency of 0.46%. In contrast, the solid-state device incorporating this push–pull SubPc reached high Jsc values of nearly 4 mA cm−2 and a PCE of above 1.5%, which represent the highest value for SubPc-based DSSCs.55
Instead of using a direct linking of the SubPc to TiO2, the group of Kimura proceeded in a different way by using SubPcs as light-harvester of a ZnPc-based sensitizer. To this end, the authors synthetized two SubPcs possessing one (234) or three (235) pyridines at peripheral position which were able to form supramolecular dyads with ZnPc via Zn–N coordination (Fig. 66). These pyridine-SubPc derivatives showed an emission which nicely overlaps with the absorption of ZnPc. As a result, an efficient FRET between SubPc and ZnPc was observed in solution. In this way, the incorporation of SubPcs bound to ZnPc sensitizer in DSSCs led to panchromatic responses with additional photocurrent generations in the range of 500–600 nm. The device incorporating trisubstituted-SubPc afforded a respectable PCE of 5%.113

2.7.1.5 Subphthalocyanine-containing perovskites solar cells. 
Solar cells based on organo-metal halide perovskites (PerSCs) have gained an unprecedented research interest reaching impressive PCEs above 25% in a few years. In view of the potential that SubPcs have demonstrated in the other configurations, some authors have started to explore their potential also in this type of solar cells. However, it should be noted that, since in this case the perovskite layer is the light absorber, the role of SubPc is just extracting the holes or electrons (HTM or ETM) from such layer. Accordingly, this section is divided in (1) SubPcs as HTM and (2) SubPcs as ETM.
2.7.1.5.1 Subphthalocyanines as HTM. 
In an attempt to substitute the well-known spiro-OMeTAD, the groups of Lianos and Kumar explored the use of 20 as HTM.463 In this study, the authors prepared a PerSC consisting of a CH3NH3PbClxI3−x perovskite deposited onto a mesoporous TiO2 surface by spin coating, where the SubPc layer was subsequently introduced by vacuum deposition. SEM studies revealed well-defined layer structure evidencing that this fabrication method is effective. Interestingly, when this device was stored under ambient conditions in dark, it underwent an incubation period of 9 days during which the efficiency increased, affording a maximum PCE of 6.6%. The cell stability with and without SubPc was studied by Micro-Raman techniques. With SubPc, the device started to degrade after the 9th day. In contrast, the device without SubPc rapidly degraded in a period of two days. Therefore, it was concluded that the placement of SubPc on the top slowed down the degradation process.
Further research on this SubPc-based HTMs was reported by Wan et al. describing the use of a new Me6SubPc-Cl.26 In this case the SubPc was deposited by spin coating and integrated in the following solar cell configuration: FTO/SnO2/PCBM/perovskite/Me6SubPc-Cl/Au. The layer morphology was again evaluated by SEM measurements and revealed that the SubPc formed a smooth and flat surface in contact with perovskite and Au layers. After that, the solar cell performance of this novel derivative was measured under AM 1.5G illumination and compared with that of 20 and spiro-OMeTAD. Remarkably, the Me6SubPc-Cl device outperformed that of spiro-OMeTAD and 20, displaying a high Voc of 0.986 V and a PCE of 6.96%. The authors attributed these results to the fact that the HOMO–LUMO levels of Me6SubPc-Cl are better aligned with the valence band of the perovskite material.
Xu and co-workers proceeded in a different way by incorporating 20 as a passivating agent with the aim of filling the voids and defects in the perovskite surface.464 They found that, upon addition of small SubPc concentrations (0.5–1 mg mL−1), the free charge carrier lifetime increased because of the efficient passivation of the surface defect trap-states. Thus, the Jsc and FF values dramatically raised boosting the PCE up to 13.6%. The addition of higher concentrations of SubPc led to the formation of clusters that hinder the charge transfer from perovskite to PC61BM and therefore lower device performances. Another noteworthy aspect is the mildness of the device fabrication method. The SubPc was deposited by spin-coating thus avoiding the damage of the perovskite by thermal annealing, as for example may happen with other common strategies, such as the thermal deposition of polymers.
2.7.1.5.2 Subphthalocyanines as ETM. 
In contrast to the extensive research carried out to optimize the HTM in PerSCs, ETMs are mainly monopolised by fullerene and its derivatives. Accordingly, for the same shortcomings commented in Sections 2.7.1.1.2 and 2.7.1.2.2, there is an urgent need to develop non-fullerene organic ETMs. Inspired by their success in the conventional p–n devices, several authors have just recently explored the use of SubPcs as ETM in PerSCs. The first example was reported by He, Russell, Djurišić and co-workers.465 In this pioneering work, they employed a mixed acceptor layer composed of SubPc 2 an C60 and reported an impressive PCE of 22% using the device architecture depicted in Fig. 67. More importantly, the authors demonstrated that the implementation of a SubPc in the ETM significantly increased the device stability. Based on a comprehensive device characterization, the authors explained that the SubPc chemically interacts with the perovskite halide ions in a such a way that avoid their migration toward the electrode. As a result, these devices exhibited an unprecedent long-term stability (95% of PCE retained over 1200 hour of outdoor testing and 90% of PCE retained under illumination and MPPT for over 2000 h).

In parallel to this work, Torres, Nazeeruddin and co-workers reported the use of 2 and it fluorinated analogue Cl6SubPc-F as ETM, either alone or in combination with C60, in PerSCs where the active layer were deposited by solution processing method (triple-cation mixed-halide perovskite; CsFAMAPbIBr) or by thermal evaporation (methylammonium lead iodide; MAPI).466 In all cases, the SubPc with chlorine atom outperformed the derivative with fluorine. Unfortunately, the incorporation of SubPc into the ETM did not improve the PCE (maximum PCEs of 7.7% and 10.8% in MAPI and CsFAMAPbIBr devices, respectively). As deduced from the J–V curves, EQE spectra, and PL, the low efficiencies mainly arise from the low charge extraction capability that the SubPc present in these specific set-ups. In spite of that, this work established a fundamental starting point for the further research of SubPcs as non-fullerene ETM in PerSCs. In spite of obtaining very low efficiencies, the groups of Atienza and Remiro-Buenamañana also claimed the potential of SubPcs in PerSCs by finding that the co-crystallization with SubPcs improves the photoresponse of the perovskite in the visible region.467


2.7.2 Applications in biochemistry and biology. 
In recent years, porphyrinic photosensitizers have gained increasing attention also for the detection and treatment of several diseases.468–470 In this field, SubPcs have also demonstrated a great potential. On the one hand, SubPcs present intensive absorption an emission within the biological window, which enables their use as fluorescence probes for the detection of diseases. On the other hand, with regard to the therapeutic activity, they have a longer triplet lifetime compared to other widely used porphyrinoids, such as porphyrins or Pcs, and therefore usually provide excellent quantum yields for the generation of singlet oxygen (Section 2.3.7). In addition, SubPcs can exhibit excellent water solubility due to their low tendency towards aggregation and their versatility in terms of functionalization, which is of paramount importance for their study in the living world.
In this section we will show the recent works reporting on the use of SubPcs in biomedicine and we will analyse what factors determines their efficiency as imaging or therapeutic agent. According to the role of the SubPc, this section is in turn divided in two parts, depending on whether the SubPc molecule is exclusively used for bioimaging or has a therapeutic effect. In the latter case, the SubPc derivative can also be employed as molecular probe.
2.7.2.1 Subphthalocyanines as probes for bioimaging. 
The first concern in the application of SubPcs in biochemistry is to select the best method for their introduction into the cell media. In addition to diagnosing, the in vitro visualization by microscopy is a powerful tool to assess what method is the most suitable. A priori, the synthesis of water-soluble derivatives seems to be the most efficient approach. To this end, the SubPc can be functionalized with polar groups at either the axial or the peripheral positions.1 However, several authors have also obtained encouraging results by means other strategies. For instance, Decréau and co-workers explored the use of several SubPcs as fluorescence probes for melanoma B16 cells and followed two strategies to place them into cells.97 The first one involved the nano-encapsulation of hydrophobic SubPcs in a lipidic nanoparticle (i.e., liposome). Once incorporated in cells, such liposomes are expected to fuse with the cell membranes, leaving the SubPc in a membrane (bilayer) environment. The second strategy consisted of the synthesis of water-soluble SubPcs which are axially functionalized with an alkylsulfonate derivative (Fig. 68). Remarkably, both strategies turned out to be equally efficient and did not showed cytotoxicity. Another noteworthy finding in this work was that, depending on the pH, SubPcs bearing amine-containing axial substituents can show a pH activatable fluorescence. In a subsequent work, the same group developed a new strategy to achieve water solubility consisting in the axial functionalization of SubPcs with a chelator moiety (tetraxetan; DOTA, or Pentetic acid; DPTA) complexed with medically relevant metals, such as Gd, Y or In (Fig. 69).100 These derivatives, which are bimodal contrast agents, showed sharp Q-bands in water, thus evidencing high solubility, and also provided good fluorescence images of B16 cells by means confocal/biphoton microscopy.

 Fig. 69  SubPcs appended with a chelator moiety (DOTA or DTPA) complexed with several metals: Gd, Y, In, Cu, Ga, Lu employed by Decréau et al. Adapted with permission from ref. 100. 
Further research in the application of SubPcs as probes have involved their conjugation with biomolecules to achieve site-selective bioimages. For instance, the axial position of SubPc or SubPc-containing liposomes has been functionalized with bombesin, a well-known peptide which is an over-expressed receptor at the surface of tumour cells.108 In this case, the use of liposome was found to be the most suitable approach since the direct functionalization of SubPcs led to modest water solubility and low stability, presumably due to the intrinsic sensibility of SubPc against certain nucleophiles. Unfortunately, such liposomes lost inhibitory activity with respect to the reference compound (Bombesin [1–14]), which exhibited 66-fold affinity for BBN receptors. Importantly, this work claims again the use of liposomes as promising alternative to employ non-water-soluble or unstable SubPcs. In 2020, Voskuhl and co-workers described the synthesis of axially substituted SubPcs that are able to form host-guest complexes with cyclodextrins. Interestingly, these conjugates produced excellent fluorescence images and exhibited a lower phototoxicity in comparison with the free SubPc.471 Other studies describing the use of axially functionalized SubPcs involve SubPc-BODIPY dyads which, depending on the excitation wavelength, display dual-color emission or even singlet oxygen generation.472,473
With regard to SubPcs peripherally functionalized, Trivedi and co-workers employed SubPcs and SubNc with different degrees of peripheral fluorination to visualize MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cells by epifluorescence microscopy.52 As expected, the number of fluorine atoms strongly affects the optical and physical properties of these compounds (e.g., quantum yield and solubility), as well as their cellular uptake. The same authors reported later a similar study using F3SubPc-Cl. This SubPc, which has fewer F-atoms than those of the previous work, showed similar fluorescence properties (ϕ = 0.29), improved cellular uptakes, and produced excellent fluorescence images from cells.474
It is important to mention that, although all of the above-mentioned work has been carried out in vitro, SubPcs have also proven effective for in vivo fluorescence experiments. In this regard, Yurt et al. demonstrated that tBu3SubPcs axially holding m-hydroxybenzoic acid tend to accumulate in tumoral cells and are promising imaging agents for the diagnosis of breast tumor.475
2.7.2.2 Subphthalocyanines as therapeutic agents. 
As mentioned above, SubPcs can produce 1O2 in high quantum yields and thus can also be employed for the photodynamic therapy of several diseases. Specifically, the treatment of (1) antibiotic-resistant bacteria and (2) cancer have been the main targeted diseases.
2.7.2.2.1 Therapy of bacteria. 
The potential of SubPcs in this field was firstly documented by Kim and co-workers by publishing a pioneering work reporting the use of SubPc-based nanospheres for the killing of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (Fig. 70).18 These nanospheres were prepared by olefin cross-metathesis of alkenylmercapto-SubPcs, followed by the alkylation of sulfur atoms to obtain a positively charged surface. Such positive charges improve the solubility in water and the ability to target negatively charged bacterial membranes. Using molecular mechanics models and several microscopies, it was found that these nanospheres have an average diameter of 150 nm and contain approximately 18.000 SubPc units. After the synthesis and characterization, the authors assessed the in vitro photobiological activity against several Gram-negative, -positive, and antibiotic-resistant bacterial cells. Remarkably, these nanoparticles yielded excellent result by showing a more than 99% efficiency of photoinactivation even with a dose as low as 4.2 J cm−2 and a loading concentration of 10 nm. It is important to highlight that the nanosphere largely outperformed the efficiency of the SubPc monomers, presumably due to it generates a higher local concentration of 1O2. Moreover, the higher local concentration compared to any given small molecule also enhances the interaction with the given microbe. Worth of mention is that in addition this material displayed interesting photoacoustic properties that may render it useful in photoacoustic tomography imaging (PTI).

An alternative strategy comprises the combination of SubPcs with species that are also able to form 1O2. For instance, the use of SubPc linked to TiO2 nanoparticles has recently been described by Ozturk et al. They demonstrated that these derivatives exhibit good inhibitory and bactericidal effects on S. aureus and E. coli strains when irradiated with different light doses.476 Remarkably, a subsequent work by the same authors demonstrated that these conjugates also have promising antifungal properties.477
The use of SubPcs in field have been further explored using simpler, non-soluble derivatives. For instance, Yurt et al. found promising bactericidal effects (almost zero CFU values upon 20 J cm−2 light doses and a cc of 64 μg mL−1) in the treatment of Gram-positive (S. aureus) and Gram-negative (E. coli) strains with a SubPc holding a phenoxy derivative in the boron atom.115
2.7.2.2.2 Therapy of cancer. 
In 2007, Xu et al. demonstrated for the first time the application of a SubPc sensitizer for the PDT of cancer. They found that water-soluble SubPc axially functionalized with ethylene glycol moieties could serve as efficient photosensitizers by exhibiting a high photocytotoxicity against HepG2 human hepatocarcinoma and HT29 human colon adenocarcinoma cells, offering in certain cases IC50 values as low as 0.02 μM.478
More than ten years later, Torres, Juarranz de la Fuente, de la Escosura and co-workers published a key article exploring the dual-role of a novel series of SubPcs as fluorescence probes and PDT sensitizers (Fig. 71).77 In order to modulate the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity, the SubPcs were functionalized with different substituents at the axial position with (1) a pyrene-containing hydrophobic moiety (236), where the pyrene moiety could act as an additional fluorophore, (2) an amino group with two alkoxylated chains for increasing hydrophilicity (237), or (3) a hydrophobic group without the pyrene unit (238). The biological activity of these derivatives was firstly tested in vitro employing HeLa, SCC-13, and A431 cancer cells lines. These SubPcs efficiently entered into the tumoral cells and provided excellent fluorescence images. Interestingly, fluorescence microscopy revealed that the subcellular localization of SubPcs depends on the axial substituent. Then, the phototoxicity of SubPcs upon green light irradiation was addressed considering different concentrations and cellular types. As inferred from the drastic decrease in cell survival, these SubPcs showed excellent activity. To further confirm the theranostic potential of these derivatives, preliminary in vivo studies were carried out with the best SubPc. The authors found that the SubPc fluorescence can also be detected in vivo, and that a significant size reduction of the treated tumoral cells was observed after the irradiation.
 Fig. 71  Axially substituted SubPcs 236–238 investigated by Torres, Juarranz de la Fuente, de la Escosura and co-workers in ref. 76. 
Very recently, Novakova, Martínez-Díaz and Torres reported an insightfully study exploring the impact of axial and peripheral substitution on the optical properties and photodynamic activity of SubPcs.479 In this work, the authors prepared SubPcs axially functionalized with tyrosine methyl ester (Tyr) or benzo-18-crown-6 (CE), and peripherally functionalized with alkylsulfanyl groups or halogen atoms, such as fluorine or iodine. Importantly, these axial ligands were found to improve the hydrophilic properties of SubPcs. Upon light irradiation, most of the prepared SubPcs showed high in vitro photodynamic activity. In particular, the SubPc derivative holding axial CE and peripheral alkylsulfanyl groups showed the best IC50 values (i.e., 2.3 and 4.4 nM for SK-MEL-28 and HeLa cells, respectively).
Following another concept, Ng, García-Iglesias and Torres published a pioneering work reporting the use of a SubPc-based sensitizer able to self-assemble in water into spherical nanoparticles.260 To this end, the SubPc was functionalized with tetra(ethylene glycol) side-chains and an axial fluorine atom to improve the aggregation properties of SubPcs. The resulting SubPc-based aggregates readily internalised into cancer cells and localised in the lysosomes. Through gradual disassembling, the photosensitising nanosystem is activated, leading to cell death with IC50 values as low as 1.2 μM.
The application of SubPc–TiO2 conjugates have also been documented for the therapy of cancer. In particular, it has been assessed their photoactivity against several carcinoma cell lines, such as HepG2 or HT29. These derivatives have proven to be very efficient against HepG2 but showed modest activity against HT29. In the former case, concentrations as low as 1.57 μM were needed to achieve phototoxicities above 95%, whereas concentrations above 6.25 μM were required for HT29. In addition, the labelling of these SubPc–TiO2 nanoparticles with 131I and their use in nuclear bioimaging have been described.117 In a subsequent work, the same authors carried out a similar study in mammary (EMT6) and cervical (HeLa).480 Again, photocytotoxicities close to 100% were obtained at a cc. of 2.2 mg mL−1 and a light dose of 90 J cm−2. Very recently, Yurt and co-workers evaluated the photodynamic activity of SubPcs on colon carcinoma cells (HT-29). This compound displayed good PDT properties (phototoxicity above 90% at cc. of 3.13 μg mL−1 and 30 J cm−2) and, more interestingly, showed an uptake in HT-29 cells two-fold higher than the healthy cell line.481
2.7.2.2.3 Subphthalocyanines as anti-inflammatory agents. 
In addition to the treatment of cancer and bacteria, some studies have demonstrated that SubPcs can regulate or stimulate the immunomodulatory response of macrophages. For example, it has been documented that 72 and thiophene-substituted SubPcs have anti-inflammatory activity on macrophages and can be used to suppress the pro-inflammatory activities of the macrophages.112,482 In stark contrast, the introduction of three peripheral iodine atoms (i.e., I3SubPc-OPh) triggers the opposite effect and provides adjuvant and immunostimulatory functions by increasing the pro-inflammatory cytokine production levels. On the other hand, SubPcs decorated with peripheral chlorine atoms have also displayed promising anti-inflammatory properties. In this regard, it has been found that the more degree of chlorination, the higher is the activity of the SubPc. In particular, 48 efficiently inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory TNF and IL6 cytokines in mammalian macrophages after 10 min of Xenon light irradiation.483


2.7.3 Additional applications. 
The unique structural, physical, and optoelectronic properties of SubPcs render them potential active materials not only in organic photovoltaics or biology but also in a plethora of applications that range from molecular optoelectronics to catalysis. In this section we will outline the reported work on SubPcs in these additional fields which, despite being not so explored as those previously commented in Sections 2.7.1 and 2.7.2, have attracted increasing attention in material science.
2.7.3.1 Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). 
Since the pioneering work carried out by the groups of Torres484 and Chen,485 SubPcs have proven to be a promising class of orange emitters with excellent electrical performance in OLEDs. In this context, noteworthy is the work of Bender et al. These authors firstly observed that the fluorination degree has a negative impact on the luminescence efficiency.209 Then, they found that SubPcs holding phthalimide at axial position can exhibit the dual function of being the (p- or n-type) charge carrier and the emitter material. Remarkably, this derivative produced good luminescence efficiencies as both hole (77 cd m−2) and electron (143 cd m−2) transport emitter.154 Furthermore, the use of organic polymers functionalized with SubPcs have been reported. This strategy, although still suffering from low luminance, represents a promising option to prepare solution-processed devices.145 Importantly, Bender et al. also found that SubPc performances in OLEDs devices are drastically improved when, instead of using neat films, the SubPc is diluted in a host material that balances the hole and electron transport.486,487 Moreover, SubPcs have been employed as charge generation layer in tandem OLEDs by Yu et al.488 They employed a blend film of 20 and C60 to connect two identical electroluminescence units based on Ir(ppy)3. This 20:C60 layer was found to be very beneficial for the OLEDs performance by displaying excellent charge generating and transport abilities.
2.7.3.2 Nonlinear optics (NLO). 
By virtue of their particular symmetry and electronic structure, these macrocycles have displayed excellent second harmonic generation (SHG) when functionalized with various donor or acceptor substituents. Indeed, quadratic hyperpolarizability β values offered by some of them are among the highest values reported for organic molecules. Moreover, the third-order harmonic generation (THG) by SubPc have also been reported and respectable cubic susceptibilities (γ) have been obtained. However, although some strategies have been recently developed to improve this nonlinearity, such as the functionalization with gold nanoparticles489 or the control of film morphology by annealing,246 this field was primarily explored during the first decade of this century.1
2.7.3.3 Organic field effect transistors (OFETs). 
Organic field effect transistors (OFETs) are the basic building blocks for many flexible integrated circuits and displays and still constitute a very active research area. Nevertheless, although a recent example has been reported,490 the application of SubPc in this field was also mainly developed at the beginning of this century and we refer the reader to our previous review.1
2.7.3.4 Organic photodetectors (OPDs). 
The donor–acceptor heterojunction of SubPcs has also found utility in the field of organic photodetectors. In this case, 20, 78, and 224 have been the derivatives of choice and very respectable EQE values and spectral sensitivities have been obtained.21,491–495 Worth of special mention in this field is the contribution of Miyajima, Araoka, and co-workers.13 They demonstrated that a SubPc with peripheral thioethers (Fig. 72) assembles into a no centrosymmetric columnar liquid crystal upon external electric fields and exhibit bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), a very interesting property for next generation molecular materials, such as more efficient photodetectors. When the authors deposited this columnar assembly between two ITO electrodes, the resultant device reaches a light-on/off ratio as high as 6.6 × 103, which is a value comparable to that of typical OPD utilizing a donor–acceptor bulk-heterojunction.

2.7.3.5 Resistive memories. 
In 2017, the group of Yam successfully prepared a SubPc-containing resistive memory device by solution processing.171 To this end, the SubPcs were functionalized at both the axial (239) and the peripheral positions 240 with a push–pull fragment (Fig. 73). Remarkably, the authors found that, depending on the substitution pattern, a switching of behaviour from binary to ternary can be observed. Thus, axially substituted SubPcs exhibit ternary resistive memory behaviour with well separated current ratios of 1:106:108 between “OFF”, “ON1” and “ON2” states, while only binary logic is observed for peripherally substituted SubPc.

2.7.3.6 Electrochromic materials. 
For this application, the SubPc core has been functionalized with three terpyridines in such a way that, in the presence of Fe(II), furnishes a metallo-supramolecular polymer (poly-SubPc–Fe). When this polymer was subjected to positive potential (from 0 to 1.6 V), excellent blue-to-transmissive transitions were observed. This discoloration is due to the oxidation of Fe(II) to (III), which avoids the MLCT from Fe to SubPc ligand. Importantly for future applications, this process was found to be highly reversible.15
2.7.3.7 Photoredox catalysis. 
Given the strong and red-shifted absorption of SubPcs, some authors have envisaged their use in the rapidly growing field of photoredox catalysis. In this case, the role of SubPc is (1) capturing the light to reach the excited state, (2) generating high-energy, SubPc-based radical ions and (3) triggering an electron transfer process while returning to the ground state (Fig. 74). On this basis, Shibata and co-workers found that trifluoroethoxylated SubPcs is very effective to catalyse the iodo-trifluoromethylation of alkenes under red LED irradiation.496 Indeed, after optimizing several parameters, this SubPc outperformed other commonly used photocatalysts by furnishing the model product in a 96% yield after 1 hour. Importantly, it was found that the reaction does not work when using 20 as catalyst, thus suggesting that the peripheral substitution of SubPc with trifluoroethoxy groups is crucial for its catalytic activity. Another example in this field includes that of García and co-workers.155 This group demonstrated that a SubPc encapsulated within a metal–organic framework can generate α-ketyl radicals from α-haloacetophenones under sunlight irradiation. Once formed, these radicals may trigger different reactions, such as the dehalogenation or the coupling with alkenes.
 Fig. 74  Action mechanism of SubPc-based photocatalysts. 
A different approach was introduced by Ma and co-workers by employing SubPcs for the photodegradation of organic pollutants. These authors functionalized the axial position of SubPcs with several ligands to incorporate them to TiO2. In this case, the role of the SubPc is to improve the catalytic activity by populating the conduction band of these materials which subsequently produce superoxide or hydroxyl radicals.497–502 This SubPc-doping of TiO2 has also found to improve the catalytic efficiency in hydrogen generation processes.503
2.7.3.8 Catalysis in lithium batteries. 
The features of lithium batteries can be improved by using a catalyst that facilitate the redox reactions operating in them. Along this line, the group of Zhang has explored the integration of several SubPcs in Li/SOCl2 batteries. Based on voltammetry experiments, the authors advanced the ability of such SubPcs to catalyse the SOCl2 reduction (SOCl2 + 2e− → 1/2S + 1/2SO2 + 2Cl−). Thus, they found that batteries whose electrolytes contained SubPcs displayed an increase up to 40.6 and 53.2% in the storage energy and capacity, respectively. Moreover, SEM images revealed that SubPcs avoid the formation of LiCl films at the electrodes, which typically leads to great efficiency losses.103,131
2.7.3.9 Molecular machines. 
Very recently, SubPcs have started to find some application in the field of molecular machines. In 2020, Shimizu, Pantos and co-workers prepared a rotaxane employing SubPcs as stoppers. The equilibrium between the slipping-on and slipping-off configurations in these rotaxanes was found to be highly dependent on the SubPc peripheral substitution. Moreover, such substitution was also found to modulate the electron transfer between the SubPc and NDI of the thread.79
2.7.3.10 Sensors. 
By virtue of their strong absorption in the visible range and their sensitivity to certain nucleophiles, SubPcs have also found utility in the field of anion sensors. In particular, they have proven to be particularly useful in the detection of fluorine504 and cyanide ions.27,505,506 In addition, it has been theoretically predicted that SubPcs could be effective for the detection of I−, Br−, and BF4− ions.507 SubPcs have also been successfully employed for the analysis of red wines,25 the determination of catechin in tea extracts,140 the assay of acetylsalicylic acid in the drug Cardiomagnyl,508 and for the sensing of pesticides.509 Interestingly, the Park's group recently reported a new strategy for the selective detection of sulfide anion, which is based on anion–π non-covalent interactions between the sulfide and the π-cloud of fluorinated SubPcs.510

3. Subporphyrazines
3.1 Synthesis and reactivity of subporphyrazines
SubPzs are curved, aromatic macrocycles, consisting of three pyrrole subunits connected through their 2,5-positions by aza-bridges.1 Their structure results from the formal removal of the three fused benzene rings in a SubPc. The first synthesis and unequivocal characterization of these compounds was reported in 2005 by Rodríguez-Morgade and Torres6 in an article that described these porphyrinoids bearing alkyl and sulfanyl substituents directly attached to the β-positions of the pyrrole subunits (Scheme 19, 241, 246–8). Soon after, the preparation of 242 was reported By Kobayashi and Durfee.511 Similar to SubPcs, SubPzs are cone-shaped, 14 π-electron aromatic compounds that so far are known exclusively as boron(III) complexes.
 Scheme 19  The synthesis of SubPzs through cyclotrimerization reaction. Note that only C3 regioisomer is represented. 250 is obtained as a mixture of the C3 and C1 regioisomers. 
The synthesis of SubPzs is carried out by cyclotrimerization of substituted maleonitriles templated by boron trichloride, usually in refluxing xylene.6,511 For SubPzs substituted with thioethers at their periphery, this procedure requires a tedious separation of the desired hexasulfanyl-SubPz and a monochlorinated SubPz arising from replacement of one thioether function by a chlorine atom under the cyclotrimerization conditions. Alternatively, the crude reaction containing the mixture of hexasulfanylated and chlorinated compounds can be treated with the corresponding 1-alkylthiol in 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI) at 0 °C, affording the symmetric hexasulfanyl-SubPzs.512
With only one exception constituted by the unsubstituted derivative, which resulted to be unstable,513 the corresponding fumaronitriles do not afford SubPzs under the same reaction conditions. This hypothesis has recently been reinforced through the reaction of a cis/trans-mixture of the perfluorinated bisaryl dinitrile with BCl3 in p-xylene, which leads to SubPz 249 and recovery of the unreacted fumaric isomer.514
Apart from the perfluorinated SubPz 249, other hexaaryl-SubPzs (255–267) have not been prepared directly from a cyclotrimerization reaction, because the corresponding bisaryl maleonitrile precursors are difficult to prepare. In these cases, the thermodynamically more favoured fumaronitrile isomers are obtained as the main, or sometimes exclusive products. Attempts to photoisomerize these fumaronitriles into the corresponding maleonitriles lead to inseparable mixtures with phenanthrene-9,10-dicarbonitriles and their 4a,4b-dihydro derivatives, arising from photochemically driven electrocyclic reactions.515,516 1,1,2-Tricyano-2-arylethylene derivatives contain the required configuration for two of the nitrile groups, so they have been cyclotrimerized to construct push–pull SubPzs (Table 8, 250–252).517 Owing to the unsymmetric nature of the tricyano-precursors, SubPz 250 was obtained as a mixture of two regioisomers with C3 and C1 molecular symmetry, isolated in a 33:1 ratio. The discrepancy of this ratio from the statistical ratio (1:3) was explained on the basis of the instability of these push–pull SubPzs in solution. In particular, the C1 isomer is less stable than the C3 isomer, and for 251 and 252, only the C3 regioisomers were obtained.

The difficulties associated to the synthesis of substituted maleonitriles, in addition to the incompatibility of many functional groups with boron trichloride have precluded the preparation of SubPzs peripherally substituted with functional groups other than those described above. Peripheral functionalization with aryl and vinylene moieties has been achieved by modification of preformed SubPzs through Pd catalyzed, CuTC mediated cross-coupling reactions of hexasulfanylated SubPzs with a variety of arylboronic512,518 or vinylboronic512 acids, respectively (Scheme 20). This strategy has allowed to introduce functional groups of different nature attached to the SubPz periphery through arylene (255–267) or vinylene (268–270) linkers. The resulting extended π-systems showed strong electronic communication between the macrocycles and the terminal functional groups, this serving to modulate in depth the electronic character of the macrocycles.512,518

Contrasting to SubPcs, for which axial substitution can be an issue,68 SubPzs readily react at the axial position.63,159 The axial chlorine atom arising from the cyclotrimerization with BCl3 has been replaced by hydroxy,6,511 phenoxy,63,159t-butylphenoxy512,518 or fluorine159,214 by simple substitution with water, phenol, t-butylphenol or treatment with BF3·Et2O, respectively (Scheme 21). All of these reactions occur with higher efficiency on SubPzs than in SubPcs.

The high axial reactivity of SubPzs has been used to assemble SubPz dimers and trimers by direct reaction of the chloro-SubPzs with hydroquinone and phloroglucinol, affording 279 and 280 (Fig. 75) in 40% and 64%, respectively.519

A different functionalization of SubPzs at the axial position consisted in the formation of π-complexes by treating axial phenoxy-SubPz with a Cp*Ru+ salt.63 Within SubPzs, Ru coordination takes place exclusively to the axial phenoxy group, without altering the pyrrole units. Therefore, the corresponding arrays 281 and 282, connected by a ruthenoarene unit (Scheme 22), have been prepared in 90% yield by treating 279 and 280 with an excess of [Ru(Cp*)–(MeCN)3][PF6] in dichloromethane (Scheme 22). Electrochemical and photophysical studies revealed strong coupling between the electron-accepting SubPzs and the electron-donating hydroquinone or phloroglucinol linkers in 279 and 280. Upon functionalization of these spacers with the organometallic Ru(II) subunit, the electron-donating benzene core is replaced by the electron-accepting ruthenocene unit,63 thus limiting inter-SubPz interactions in 281 and 282.

The SubPz axial substituent has also been subjected to classical organic reactions such as reduction and esterification reactions (Scheme 23), to link a selected SubPz (283) to a pentacene dimer, which acts primarily as energy acceptor and secondarily as a singlet fission enabler.520

3.2 Characterization of subporphyrazines

3.2.1 Single-crystal X-ray diffraction. 
The crystal structure of fluoro[1,2,6,7,11,12-hexapropylsubporphyrazinato] boron (277) exhibits a cone shape with the boron atom coordinated to three nitrogen atoms and the fluorine atom situated at the vertex of an almost regular tetrahedron (see Fig. 76 and Table 9). The degree of curvature can be characterized by the SubPz bowl-depth, defined by the distance from the mean plane of peripheral six β-pyrrole carbons to the center boron atom.159 The bowl-depth of 277 is of 1.768 Å, so the curvature is slightly more pronounced than that of SubPcs (see ref. 1 and Section 2.3.1), and definitely more pronounced than that of SubPs, as it has been predicted by DFT calculations (see Section 6.3.1).1,521,522 Peripheral triarylation517 or hexaarylation512,518 do not produce relevant changes in the SubPz bowl depth.

Triarylated SubPzs exhibit relatively small dihedral angles (from 17.43° to 27.45° in C3-250) of aryl groups with respect to the plane defined by the pyrrole to which they are attached.517 Upon hexaarylation, these dihedral angles increase, ranging from 28.45° to 54.80, as a result of the higher steric congestion related to C3-250,512,518 although they are still smaller than those observed for porphyrazines (24.26° to 68.18°).523 This is related to the Cα–N–Cα angles, which are smaller for SubPzs than for porphyrazines (114° vs. 124°, respectively), providing more room for peripheral substituents in the former, and favouring π-conjugation over the entire molecule. In fact, only substitution at the meta-positions of hexaarylated SubPzs with sterically demanding tert-butyl groups forces to adopt less coplanar conformations, up to 68.12° in 267, which are comparable to those of p-tert-butylphenyl porphyrazines.523
Among hexaarylated SubPzs substituted with one methoxy group per benzene ring (compounds 256 and 262), the dihedral angles between two consecutive benzene rings are significantly larger for the sterically more congested meta-substituted compounds (54.80° to 58.30° for 262) than for the para-substituted SubPzs (38.57 to 55.96 for 256). The angles between two consecutive benzene rings are also much smaller than those observed for the corresponding octaarylated porphyrazines. As a result of all these smaller dihedral angles between the substituents and macrocycle, peripheral aryl substituents produce stronger influences on the electronic properties of SubPzs related to those of porphyrazines.
Hexavinylation produces a slight planarization of the SubPz structure, with a bowl depth of 1.600 Å observed for 269 (Table 9). Indeed, the degree of curvature of 269 is the same as that observed for the SubPz internal core of dodecafluorinated SubPc 4, which displays a SubPz bowl depth of 1.604 Å.159 The smaller volume of the vinylene moieties related to that of the phenylene rings allows for a more planar configuration and hence, a more effective π-delocalization over the whole structure. Thus, the vinylene CC bonds in 269 lie nearly in the same plane as the pyrrole rings, with small deviation angles ranging from 2.69° to 6.30°, except for one of the CC moieties, which is tilted by 18.45°. Importantly, the dihedral angles between the pyrrole and the terminal phenyl rings in 269 are also much smaller (2.92° to 32.70°) than those of the triarylated and hexaarylated series, favouring a stronger electronic communication between the macrocycle and the terminal phenyl ring in the former. Such an enlargement of the absorptive and radiative chromophore was evidenced also in UV-vis spectroscopy as we will discuss below.
In the solid state, SubPzs have a high tendency to assemble into aggregates of different dimensions, whose geometry is strongly dependent on the axial and peripheral functionalization.159,511 For example, SubPzs 277, 262, 263 and 267 stack in head-to-tail, alternating configurations, but in 277 the axial B–F bonds are perfectly aligned within a column and parallel between columns (Fig. 77),159 while for 262 the axial B–O bonds are not aligned within a column, although they are parallel. For 263 the axial B–O bonds are angled between columns, and for 267 the macrocycles are arranged in a zigzag fashion (Fig. 77).512 SubPz C3-250 also stacks in columns, but in this case, within the slipped-stack columns, solvent molecules reside between macrocycle molecules (Fig. 77).513

In stark contrast, SubPzs 269, 272 and 256 do not stack in columns, but can form dimers, either in a convex–convex configuration (272),511 or concave–concave arrangements that can form dimeric capsules (256) (Fig. 77),518 or with one macrocycle slipped with respect to the other (269) (Fig. 77).512 The axial and peripheral substitution also determine the SubPzs liquid crystalline behavior in more extent than for SubPcs.6,261


3.2.2 NMR spectroscopy. 
The 1H-NMR spectra of SubPzs evidences their C3-symmetry and indicates free rotation of the peripheral appendages, even for the bulkier substituents of 262, 263, 265 and 267. Their aromatic nature produces low field shifts of the protons corresponding to the peripheral substituents, accompanied by high field shifts for those of the axial functions. In particular, axial hydroxy groups appear at δ = −0.94 to −1.47 ppm6 and axial tert-butylphenoxy-substituents are seen as two doublets at 5.31–5.44 ppm and 6.82–6.90 ppm, accompanied by a singlet around 1.11–1.14 ppm.512 Boron resonances follow the same tendency as for SubPcs, appearing in 11B-NMR at δ = −14.3 to −15.8 ppm.1,159


3.2.3 Optical properties. 
The optical properties of SubPzs evidence the aromatic nature of these macrocycles. SubPzs substituted with six peripheral alkyl chains (for example, 241, 271, 272 and 277), display very similar UV-vis spectra, composed of two equally intense absorption bands at λmax = 295 (ε = 38160 l mol−1 cm−1) and 499 nm (ε = 40206 l mol−1 cm−1) for 241, corresponding to the Soret and Q-transitions, respectively (Fig. 78).6 Visible-light excitation in the 400–500 nm range generates fluorescence patterns that are virtual mirror images of the absorption, with maxima evolving at 520 nm (ΦF = 0.1 for 241).524
 Fig. 78  Comparative absorption spectra of SubPc 4 (pink line), and Pr6SubPz 241 (orange line), (H37C18S)6SubPz 248 (red line), Ph6SubPz 255 (green line) and (H7C3CHCH)6SubPz 268 (violet line). 
The removal of the three fused benzene rings from the SubPc skeleton produces a 75–80 nm blue shift of the Q-band and a slight lowering of the absorption coefficients for this band (Fig. 78). From a different viewpoint, when going from a porphyrazine to the similarly substituted SubPz, the π-conjugated system is reduced from 18 to 14 π electrons, inducing changes in the UV-vis spectra that are best exemplified by an approximately 100 nm hypsochromic shift of the Q-band.6,524–526 The corresponding MCD signal of the Q-band is a derivative-shaped Faraday A term with negative and positive envelopes at 498 and 489 nm, respectively, although the negative envelope shows a much greater intensity. Group theory suggests that SubPzs with C3V symmetry have degenerate LUMOs, and the observed spectrum is consistent with this prediction. With respect to the B-region, the corresponding MCD signal has a smaller intensity than that of the Q-band, supporting a smaller angular momentum change for the Soret band.511
The origins of the Q and Soret bands of hexaalkylSubPzs are basically similar to the SubPcs.1,214
The optical spectra of SubPzs peripherally substituted with functions containing π-electrons or heteroatoms with lone pairs display strong absorptions in a window that goes from 384 nm to 517 nm, in addition to their intense Soret and Q-bands.6,13,512,513,518 For thioether-substituted SubPzs, these features, which appear at 434 nm, have been attributed to n → π* transitions from nonbonding sulphur electrons to the macrocycle, by analogy with those exhibited by the porphyrazine tetramers.527 But in contrast with the tetramers, in SubPzs these bands are 15–25% higher than the Q-band (see Fig. 78), denoting a higher impact of peripheral thioether substituents on the electronic properties of SubPzs than in porphyrazines.6 SubPzs substituted with six peripheral aryl groups also display strong CT bands, which position and intensity correlate with the electronic character of the substituents at the aryl moieties, so that electron donors red-shift and increase CT bands, and electron acceptors blue-shift and decrease these absorptions (Fig. 80).9 In line with this, the CT band disappears when peripheral phenyl groups are perfluorinated.514
Peripheral sulfanyl and aryl substituents also shift the SubPz Q-bands to lower energies (for example, λmax = 556 and 539 for 253 and 255, respectively), which position can be modulated by further functionalizing the aryl moieties.6,512,518,524 In particular, substitution at the meta-positions with alkoxy or phenyl groups (SubPzs 262 and 265) produces little perturbation of SubPzs in the ground state, therefore, the absorption profiles are preserved. In a different way, para-substitution of aryl groups with electron-donors (SubPzs 256, 257, 258 and 263) or phenylene moieties (SubPzs 264 and 266) further red shifts the SubPz absorption bands up to 31 nm in 258 (70 nm with respect to 241),512,518 while electron acceptors produce weaker alterations (0–8 nm red shift in 259–261 with respect to 255) (Fig. 80).518 Conversely, a 11 nm blue shift of the SubPz Q-band is achieved upon decreasing the coplanar configuration of the aryl moieties with the SubPz core, through introduction of bulky alkyl rests (SubPz 267)512 (Fig. 80) or perfluorination (SubPz 249).514
The higher influence of peripheral substituents on the SubPz π-system compared to other related porphyrinoids such as Pcs, SubPcs, SubPs and porphyrazines has been ascribed to the combination of three structural features within SubPzs that do not meet in the other macrocycles, namely, their meso-aza bridges, their non-benzo-fused pyrrolic units and their electron deficient, boron(III) central atom.512 In fact, there seems to be a parallelism of these effects with those observed for phosphorus(V) octaarylporphyrazines.528
Compared to hexaarylated SubPzs, the push–pull SubPzs C3-250–252 exhibit a further red-shift of their Q bands, appearing at λmax = 633, 594 and 571 nm, respectively.517 As for the hexaarylated series, the extent of the red-shift correlates with the Hammett σp parameters of the substituents of the aryl groups. The absorption maxima of the corresponding CT bands are also red-shifted in the same order as observed for the Q band absorptions.517 Contrary to the corresponding push–pull porphyrazines for which a significant perturbation of the Q band absorption is observed going from a regioisomer to another,529C1-250 displays its Q band at 626 nm. However, significant changes featured by two broad absorptions at 499 and 435 nm are observed in the higher energy region (Fig. 79).
In the MCD spectra, a derivative-shaped Faraday A term with an inflection point close to the maximum of the Q band absorption is observed for C3-250–252, indicating degenerate excited states due to the C3 high molecular symmetry (Fig. 79). C1-250 shows the corresponding feature as a derivative-shaped pseudo Faraday A term. The latter can be observed if molecules with less than three-fold molecular symmetry accidentally possess nearly degenerate excited states.517

Peripheral hexavinylation of SubPzs produces extended π-systems owing to the coplanarity of vinylene branches with the macrocycle. This is reflected in the absorption properties of SubPz 268 by a Q-band absorption at 571 nm, similar to that a bare SubPc,1,512 in addition to a strong CT band at 431 nm denoting electronic delocalization over the vinylene moieties (Fig. 78). More importantly, in hexavinylated SubPzs the typical electronic tunability of SubPzs is preserved, and the vinylene moieties serve as linkers to electronically connect SubPzs with other π-systems or redox active chromophores. Thus, six phenyl rings connected through vinylene linkers further red shift the Q-band in SubPz 269 by 54 nm with respect to that of 268 (Fig. 80). The latter suggests a better electronic communication of the terminal phenyl rings with the macrocycle in 269 than that produced in the directly attached hexaphenyl-SubPz 255 (39 nm red shift).512
In general, the emission spectra of sulfanylated, arylated, vinylated and push–pull SubPzs mirror image the lowest energy absorptions and are bathochromically shifted with respect to those of the hexaalkylated series (see Table 10). Hexavinylation produces stronger impact (λem = 604 nm in 268) than hexaarylation (λem = 563 nm in 255). The extent of the bathochromic shift also varies with the functionalization of the aryl moieties. Thus, electron donor para-substituents produce stronger effects (36–202 nm in 256–258, 264 and 266) than meta-substituents (8–12 nm in 262, 265 and 267) and electron acceptor para-substituents (1–18 nm in 259–261).512,518 Besides, the same aryl substituents produce a higher impact when they are a part of a push–pull SubPz (for example, λem = 612 nm in 256 and λem = 662 nm in 250).512,517

3.2.4 Redox properties. 
SubPz 276 exhibits in CV two reversible redox processes, namely an oxidation at +0.83 V and a reduction at −1.72 V (Table 11). SubPzs are, therefore, more difficult to reduce and oxidize electrochemically than SubPcs. The effect of axial ligation has only a small impact on the redox properties of SubPzs. For instance, replacing the phenoxy group in 276 by a fluoride anion in 277 shifts the oxidation potential anodically by only 10 mV. As an exception, π-coordination of 276 to RuCp* to give 286 shifts the first reduction and oxidation peaks anodically by 200 mV and 140 mV, respectively.63

Peripheral functionalization produces important changes in the electrochemistry of SubPzs. Firstly, all the hexasulfanylated, hexaarylated and hexavinylated SubPzs exhibit three or four reversible reduction peaks in addition to one or two oxidation processes that are irreversible in most of the cases. Moreover, all the hexasulfanylated, hexaarylated and hexavinylated SubPzs are by 160–870 mV easier to reduce, even when functionalized with electron donor functions, such as 258 (E1/2 = −1.56 V).512,518 Significantly, the latter potential value is very close to that exhibited by the RuCp* π-complex 286. As a general trend, the effect of para-substitution in the first reduction potentials of hexaaryl-SubPzs correlates with the Hammett constants (σp) corresponding to the substituents, so that the potentials are shifted cathodically in the order: NO2 < CF3 < CO2Me < H ≈ MeS < MeO < NMe2. The most positive reduction potential corresponds to the nitro-substituted SubPz 259, with E1/2 = −0.85 V for the first reduction potential.518 In addition, the effect of the substituents can be different depending on the position to which they are attached. Thus, methoxy substituents in SubPzs 256 and 262 produce opposite effects, with E1/2 being by 90 mV cathodically shifted in 256518 with respect to 255 and by 50 mV anodically shifted in 262.512
Likewise, the oxidation trend correlates quite well with the corresponding Hammett constants for each substituent at the para-position. Again, the position of the substituents determines opposite effects. For example, 256 is 170 mV easier to oxidize than 255, while 262 is 50 mV more difficult.512


3.2.5 Theoretical calculations. 
The effect of fusing benzene rings to the SubPz backbone has been studied by the DFT method and reviewed in terms of molecular structures, molecular orbitals, atomic charges, electronic absorption, CD spectra and dipolar/octupolar second-order NLO contribution ratio.1 In addition, the computed spectral features of alkyl and thioalkyl-substituted SubPzs by means of TDDFT calculations have been confronted with the available experimental data.214 In a parallel study, the structures of beryllium SubPc and SubPz complexes have been explored using the BPW91/6-31+G(d,p)//BPW91/6-31G(d) level of theory and the TD-DFT approach.225 Both Be complexes were found to be thermodynamically stable structures in the gas phase, although NBO and AIM analyses revealed a slightly different nature of bonding in Be complexes with respect to the boron SubPcs and SubPzs. Thus, the natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis did not find bonding orbitals between SubPc, Be, and axial chloride moieties, although lone pairs of N atoms and empty Be p orbitals strongly interact. Contrasting, in the boron complexes a proper bonding orbital between B and N, as well as a bonding orbital between B and the axial substituent, were found. The predicted UV-vis spectra resulted similar to those of the corresponding boron complexes. Thus, for example, the Q-band for SubPz 277, which had been predicted in vacuo at 430 nm,214 was found at 462 nm for the corresponding beryllium complex.225
The self-assembly of beryllium SubPc and the corresponding complexes with water and pyridine has been computed at the wB97XD/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory. BeSubPc units may form face-to-face or face-to-tail dimers connected through Be–N non-covalent intermolecular interactions.226 Besides, hydrated BeSubPcs in which water is ligated at the axial positions were predicted to arrange stable face-to-face Be-SubPc dimers that are brought together through hydrogen bonds. Given its simpler structure, the corresponding hydrated BeSubPz has been used as a model to study the formation of one to three-unit columnar aggregates.226 Similar to the CH⋯F bonds previously described for BSubPc arrays,265 in this case water is responsible for the hydrogen bond interactions (O–H⋯N, O–H⋯C) between monomers that result crucial to stabilize columnar, helicoidal aggregates.226
The structural, magnetic, and optical properties of the four subporphyrinoids, namely, SubP, SubPz, BzSubP and SubPcs have also been computed using a theoretical approach based on PCM-TD-DFT with the PBE0 exchange–correlation functional.215 Using this level of theory, the 0–0 energies for SubPzs were determined with an absolute deviation of 0.2 eV with respect to the experimental results, slightly smaller than those predicted before (0.4 eV).214 In addition, the NICS value of −20.7 calculated at the center of the SubPz ring indicated a strongly aromatic character, similar to that of SubP (−20.6). Alike their tetrapyrrolic analogues, the absolute NICS values are slightly larger in the smaller SubP and SubPz compounds than in their benzo-counterparts.215

3.3 Subporphyrazines with annulated rings
Other type of SubPzs bearing heterocycles such as pyrazine, thiophene, dibenzoquinoxaline, thiadiazole, selenadiazole, and 1,3-dithiole-2-one, directly fused at the β-positions of their pyrrole units, have been the object of recent reports. As we will see, fusing aromatic heterocycles to the SubPz core leads to planarization of the structure in a higher degree than fusing benzene rings in SubPcs.
Several pyrazine-fused SubPzs have been reported (Fig. 81).64,530–535 All of these Subpyrazinoporphyrazines have been prepared by cyclotrimerization reaction of the corresponding dinitrile derivatives, in the presence of BCl3, under classical conditions. The yields range from 0.3% for 289 to 35% for 291.530,531 In SubPz 290,530,535 the SubPc bowl depth, determined as the distance of the boron atom to the mean plane formed by external carbon atoms of pyrazine rings is of ∼2.47 Å, similar to that of a SubPc, although the SubPz core is slightly more planar than a regular SubPz (SubPz bowl depth of 1.513 Å). Very recently, the C1 and C3 positional isomers of tert-butyl substituted tripyrazinoSubPzs were first obtained and efficiently separated by column chromatography.536
 Fig. 81  Structures of some subpyrazinoporphyrazines. 
Subpyrazinoporphyrazines are isoelectronic with SubPcs, in the sense that they both contain 28 π-electrons delocalized over the SubPz macrocycle and the fused six membered rings. However, the lower delocalization of the π-system in the pyrazine series with respect to the benzo series is evidenced by their electronic spectra. Thus, SubPz 289 shows its Q-band at λmax = 530 nm, more than 30 nm blue shifted related to SubPc.530 Electrochemical and DFT calculations indicate that fusing the three pyrazine rings to the SubPz structure leads to stabilization of the frontier π-molecular orbitals, and enlarging the HOMO–LUMO gap by ∼0.2 eV related to SubPcs. This endows the subpyrazinoporphyrazine dye with enhanced electron deficiency. The latter is reflected in the cyclovoltammetric study of 290, which shows its first reduction potential at E1/2 = −1.248 V vs. Fc/Fc+, that is, 472 mV easier to reduce than SubPz 276.530 The introduction of six chlorine atoms at the pyrazine rings shift this value still more anodic at −0.168 V.534
Compounds 292, 293532 and 294, 295533 contain dibenzoquinoxaline and phenanthroquinoxaline moieties, respectively, fused to the SubPz pyrroles. As expected, SubPzs 292–295 display bathochromically shifted Q-bands with respect to SubpyrazinoPzs 289–291. But surprisingly, SubPz 295, containing three additional fused rings, displays its Q band at higher energy (λmax = 588 nm) than 292 (λmax = 592 nm). DFT calculations and electrochemical studies revealed further stabilization of the frontier molecular orbitals upon fusing benzene rings to the Subpyrazinoporphyrazine structure. Indeed, dibenzoquinoxaline and phenantroquinoxaline SubPzs are very strong electron acceptors, showing their first reduction potentials anodically shifted to −1.09 V in 292 and − 0.94 V in 295.532,533
SubPzs bearing annulated 1,2,5-thiadiazole-424,537 and 1,2,5-selenadiazole-rings538 (Fig. 82) have also been prepared by BCl3 assisted cyclotrimerization of the corresponding dicyano derivatives. The effect of fusing the thiadiazoles to the SubPz core produces a planarization of the tripyrrolic moiety that is reflected by an even shorter SubPz bowl depth of 1.363 Å.538
 Fig. 82  Structures of thiadiazole- and selenadiathole SubPzs 296 and 297. 
The effects in the frontier orbitals of 296 and 297 upon annulating the sulphur and selenium heterocycles have been predicted by DFT calculations. Thus, substitution of the three HCCH fragments in SubpyrazinoPz 289 by sulphur atoms to give 296, leads to additional stabilization of both frontier orbitals, with net decrease of the HOMO–LUMO gap.538 But when the HCCH fragments are replaced by the less electronegative Se atom, the HOMO and the LUMO orbitals destabilize, the latter in lesser extent, leading to a higher decrease of the HOMO–LUMO gap, with respect to 289. Hence, the Q-band of 296 is shifted to lower energies (λmax = 538 nm), with respect to 289,537 while selenadiazole rings produce a higher displacement of both Soret and Q-bands appearing at 342 and 574 nm, respectively for 297 (Fig. 83).538 Compounds 289, 296 and 297 display emission bands at λem = 542 nm (ϕF = 0.15), 564 nm (ϕF = 0.11) and 608 nm (ϕF = 0.03), respectively and generate singlet oxygen with high quantum yields of ϕΔ = 0.7–1).538

Dichlorophenylboron(III), with lower Lewis acidity, has also been used in the synthesis of unsymmetric thiadiazole fused SubPzs through crossover cyclotrimetrization of 1,2,5-thiadiazole-3,4-dicarbanitrile with 3,4,5,6-tetrafluorophthalonitrile (Scheme 24).539 The latter affords compounds 298 and 299 bearing a phenyl group as the axial substituent. The sequential replacement of the benzene rings in a SubPc structure by these nitrogenated heterocycles reduces the degree of delocalization progressively, with the consequent blue shift of the Q-bands. In addition, the reduced symmetry of SubPzs 298 and 299 gives rise to absorption spectra with split Q-bands, exhibiting Qx and Qy components lying at 579 and 554 nm for the former, and 569 and 541 nm for the latter, respectively.
 Scheme 24  Synthesis of low-symmetry thiadiazoleSubPzs. 
Related crossover cyclotrimerization reactions have been performed using 1,2,5-selenadiazole-3,4-dicarbonitrile and phthalonitrile derivatives, namely, unsubstituted, tetrachloro- and tetrafluorophthalonitrile, in the presence of BCl3, leading to the corresponding low-symmetry selenadiazole-SubPzs.540
The use of 3,4-dicyanothiophene in similar crossover cyclotrimerization reactions afforded a mixture of the corresponding SubPc and the two thieno-fused SubPzs 300 and 301, which were obtained after axial substitution (Fig. 84). Here, the chlorine atoms arise from chlorination under the reaction conditions.541 Other attempts to obtain non-chlorinated compounds were unsuccessful or afforded unstable compounds.542
 Fig. 84  Structures of thieno-SubPzs 300 and 301. 
The effect of only one thiophene moiety slightly reduces the curvature of 300, which shows a SubPz bowl depth of 1.546 Å.541 On the other hand, removing the nitrogen atoms on going from the thiadiazole-SubPzs 298 and 299 to the thieno-SubPzs 300 and 301 enhances the electronic delocalization over the whole structure, an effect that is evidenced by the bathochromic shift of the Q-bands (Fig. 85), which Qx components now appear at λmax = 605 nm for 300 (26 nm red shift upon removal of two nitrogen atoms) and 636 nm for 301 (67 nm red shift upon removal of four nitrogen atoms).541

Tri-(benzo[b]thiopheno)subporphyrazines 302 (Fig. 86) have been prepared by cyclotrimerization reaction of the benzo[b]thiopheno)-2,3-dicarbonitrile in the presence of BCl3 followed by axial substitution.543 Chiral HPLC rendered two pairs of optically resolved regioisomers, namely R/S-C3 and R/S-C1 in a 1:2 ratio, close to the statistical distribution. In addition, both regioisomers presented a higher ratio of the S-enantiomer. Upon fusing the benzo[b]thiophene moiety to the SubPz core, the sulphur atoms are directly attached to the β-pyrrole carbons, similar to SubPzs 246 and 253 (Table 10) and different to compounds 300 and 301, in which the sulphur atoms are separated by carbon atoms. Accordingly, the UV-vis spectra of both regioisomers of 302 show features that remind the electronic spectra of the hexasulfanyl series. Thus, C3-302 shows its Q-band at 558 nm, in addition to a band at 394 nm that could be attributed to a n → π* transition from the sulphur lone pair to the macrocycle, in a parallelism with porphyrazines and SubPzs. As for C1-250, C1-302 shows a splitting of the absorption bands arising from the reduced symmetry.
 Fig. 86  Structures of tri-(benzo[b]thiopheno)subporphyrazines 302. 
1,3-Dithiole-2-one constitutes another type of heterocycle that has been directly annulated to the SubPz, by performing a BCl3 templated cyclotrimerization reaction of the corresponding 2-oxo-1,3-dithiole-4,5-dicarbonitrile.544 The latter afforded SubPz 303, which was subsequently substituted at the axial position to give 304 and 305. The 1,3-dithiole-2-one moiety is not a conjugated ring and therefore, it does not produce the typical SubPz planarization stimulated by aromatic rings like pyrazine, thiophene, thiadiazole or even benzene, discussed before in Section 3.2.1. In fact, the SubPz bowl depth of 305, with a value of 1.716 Å, falls within the range of a regular SubPz (see Table 9).
Interestingly, the electronic spectrum of 304 shows the typical envelope of a hexasulfanyl-SubPz, but somehow attenuated, displaying three absorption bands at 291, 393 and 530 nm, corresponding to B, n → π* and Q-transitions, respectively. The 50 and 30 nm blue shift observed for the CT and Q-bands, respectively, related to other hexasulfanyl-SubPzs, could be rationalized in terms of the diminished donor ability of the sulphur atoms towards the SubPz macrocycle, owing to the electron accepting nature of their neighbouring carbonyl group.
Unsymmetric SubPzs 306–308 (Fig. 87) have been prepared by crossover cyclotrimerization of tetrafluorophthalonitrile and oxo-1,3-dithiole-4,5-dicarbonitrile, followed by axial substitution under conventional reaction conditions.545

3.4 Subporphyrazine analogues
Triazasubporphyrinoids in which one or more of the pyrrole rings is replaced by other type of heterocycles, or contain other modifications in the triazaporphyrin core, will be referred to as SubPz analogues and discussed in this section. Macrocycles that preserve the SubPc isoindolic core and contain additional rings annulated to the SubPc benzene moieties will be discussed in Sections 4 and 5.
Cross-conjugated bis(1,3-dithiol-2-ylidene)-substituted subtriazachlorins 309 and 310 were serendipitously discovered when treating 308 with triethylphosphite. Whereas the goal was carrying out a coupling reaction to furnish a SubPz with a TTF moiety directly attached to the periphery (Scheme 25), the crystal structure showed that 309 displays double-bond attributes for the bonds attaching the 1,3-dithiol-2-ylidene to the β-pyrrole, and single bond nature between the β-pyrrolic carbon atoms, indicating the Subchlorin nature of this SubPz derivative,513 as well as a small contribution of the cross-conjugation to the system.545 The TTFV moiety exhibited up and down orientations of the 1,3-dithiole rings, with a small torsion angle of 45° and a close contact between the sulphur atoms, which are substantially congested. The rest of the structure retains a SubPc-like curved geometry, with a decreased SubPz bowl depth of 1.444 Å.
 Scheme 25  Synthesis of TTFV-SubPzs 309 and 310. 
The UV-vis absorption spectra of 309 and 310 reflects the presence of a deeply disturbed π-system, exhibiting a significantly split Q-band absorption at 622 and 832 nm, associated to a coupled Faraday B term in the MCD spectrum (Fig. 88). The tetrathiafulvalene vinylogue (TTFV) exhibits better electron-donating properties than TTF and hence, produces sizeable effects in the oxidation window of 309 and 310, which show a first reversible oxidation process at 0.15 V vs. Fc+/Fc. The latter can be ascribed to a TTFV centered oxidation, while a first reduction wave at −1.10 was assigned to a macrocycle-centred process.

Although containing a 14π-electron circuit, compounds 309 and 310 can be considered as SubPz analogues, because one of the pyrrole rings of the SubPz skeleton has been replaced by a 3,4-dihydropyrrole. Compounds 311 fall into the same category, and have been previously reviewed,1 as it was Subazaphenalenephthalocyanine 312 (Fig. 89), in which one of the pyrrole rings have been replaced by a benzoisoquinoline. Density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent DFT have been recently used to predict the effects of substitution with electron donating and electron withdrawing groups on the physical and optical properties of 312.546 Remarkably, Subtriazachlorin 311 constitutes the only reported stable SubPz derivative prepared using a fumaronitrile as the starting material. In Subbiliazine 313 (Fig. 89), a boron atom is used to contract a bis(pyrazolylimino)isoindoline, to form a hydrogen bond as a meso-linkage. These compounds have a bowl shape structure similar to that of SubPzs and SubPcs.547
 Fig. 89  Structures of SubPz analogues 313–313. 
More recently, one of the pyrrole rings has been replaced by azepine (314, 315 and 316)548,549 and carbazole rings (317–320).550314 and 315 contain 14 π-electron aromatic cores, which have been assembled in crossover cyclotrimerization reactions of tetrafluorophthalonitrile with 2,2′-biphenyldicarbonitrile and 4,5-phenanthrenedicarbonitrile, respectively, in the presence of BCl3 at 180 °C in 1-chloronaphthalene (Scheme 26).548 Under these conditions, an unprecedented replacement of the axial chloride by fluoride took place, presumably sourced from tetrafluorophthalonitrile.
 Scheme 26  Synthesis of azepine SubPzs 314 and 315. 
Compound 314 exhibits the typical SubPz conical structure. The biphenyl moiety is tilted by 43° from the mean plane of the three Np atoms. P and M enantiomers of 314, based on the helicity of the dibenzoazepine unit, stack alternately to form one-dimensional columnar packing assembled by π–π stacking of the macrocycles, which is enhanced by the small fluorine atom at the axial position.159 The crystal structure of 314 revealed a considerable planarization of the concave structure, characterized by a SubPz bowl depth of 1.248 Å (we have considered as bowl depth the distance between the boron atom and the mean plane containing the pyrrole β-carbons and the azepine 3 and 6 carbons). The shallower coordination geometry of the boron may cause changes in its Lewis acidity resulting in the preferential formation of the axially fluoro-substituted compounds. The absorption spectra of 314 and 315 is dominated by split Q-bands (denoted as Q1- and Q2-bands, respectively) appearing at 682 and 510 nm for 314 and 693 and 513 nm for 315, and attributed to the distorted molecular structure arising from the biphenyl moiety. The corresponding Faraday B terms in the MCD spectra, indicate nondegenerate excited states. Azepine SubPzs also exhibited fluorescence at 710 and 706 nm with fluorescence quantum yields of 0.08 and 0.006, respectively.
Another reported azepineSubPz 316 contains a chiral binaphthyl fragment fused to the azepine ring, which provides inherent and induced chirality to the macrocycle.549 The synthesis of each R or S enantiomer of 316 has been performed separately, starting from the corresponding enantiopure R or S [1,1′-binaphthalene]-2,2′-dicarbonitrile, respectively, as indicated in Scheme 27. Its absorption spectrum (Fig. 90) showed their Q1- and Q2-bands at 692 and 528 nm, respectively.
 Scheme 27  Synthesis of 316 containing a dinaphthoazepine moiety. 
 Fig. 90  MCD spectrum (top line), CD spectra (middle line) and absorption spectrum (bottom line) of compound 316. Reproduced with permission from ref. 549. 
In the MCD spectrum of 316 (Fig. 90), two Faraday-B terms were observed in the Q-band region, a negative at 690, and a positive 529 nm, indicating their homogeneous π–π* transition nature, with corresponding transitions localized on the main conjugated chromophore. In the Soret region, other two Faraday-B terms, a positive at 443 nm and a negative at 343, were detected as well. The CD spectra of (R) and (S)-316 (Fig. 90) are perfect mirror images, confirming their enantiomeric nature. Both enantiomers of 316 yielded two negative CD signals at 698 and 530 nm corresponding to the Q-band. The ratio of the CD intensity for the Q2-band was calculated to be very close (∼0.8) to that obtained for the Q1-band, confirming that both Q-bands follow the mechanism of the induced optical activity from peripheral binaphthyl group.548 On the other hand, the ratio of the CD signal at 348 nm corresponding to the Soret band is only 0.07 of that obtained for the Q1-band, indicating the inherent chirality characteristics for this Soret band.548
Carbazosubporphyrazines 321–324 (Scheme 28) contain a 16 π-electron, antiaromatic core,550 which has been assembled in two steps. The first step consists in a condensation reaction in ethanol of a diiminoisoindoline derivative and a carbazole-1,8-diamine, in a 2:1 ratio, to afford a three-unit intermediate 317–320. This type of three-unit compounds are common synthetic intermediates for the synthesis of mixed hemiporphyrazines,551 three-quarter phthalocyanines552 and porphyrazines,553 or some or their expanded analogues.554 The formation of this intermediate is followed by a boron template, ring closure to afford the SubPz analogues 321–324.
 Scheme 28  Synthesis of the antiaromatic carbazoSubPzs 321–324. 
Analysis of the crystal structure of 322 revealed a planar π skeleton, with a SubPz bowl depth of 0.473 Å. In addition, the C–N distances along the inner core do not indicate significant bond-length alternation. Evidence for the antiaromaticity of the compounds came from NMR data, absorption spectra and theoretical calculations. Specifically, the carbazoSubPz bearing a methoxy group at the axial position exhibited the corresponding resonance at δ = 3.73 nm. Significantly, the 11B-NMR spectra of 321–324 showed signals at δ = 9.10–9.23 ppm, downfield shifted related to those of fluoro-SubPzs (δ = −15.0 ppm),1 while the 19F-NMR signals were detected at δ = −91.0 to −93.7 ppm, more deshielded than the corresponding resonance of SubPzs (δ = −157.45 ppm).159 All these data indicate the presence of a paratropic ring current, with an estimated NICS(0) value of 6.35. In agreement with the NMR data, the absorption spectra (Fig. 91) showed very weak absorption envelopes over 600–900 nm, accompanying intense peaks with maxima at ∼416 nm.

A different modification of the SubPz core consists in the replacement of one or more of the meso-nitrogens by another atom. Subtribenzodiazaporphyrin 326 has been prepared by a cross-condensation reaction of the aminoisoindolene dimeric intermediate 325 with phthalonitrile in the presence of BCl3, followed by axial substitution under conventional conditions. The hybrid 326 was obtained in 15% yield, together with the corresponding symmetric SubPc and the aza-BODIPY compound 327 (Scheme 29).555 Alternatively, the cyclotrimerization reaction can be done in the presence of different boronate esters B(OR)3, in diglyme at 200 °C, affording 326 as the sole product, bearing an axial substituent derived from the type of used boronate. Although the yield was lower by the latter procedure (10%), the workup is simpler, and the procedure has the indisputable advantage of being versatile.
 Scheme 29  Synthesis of subtribenzodiazaporphyrin 326. 
The structure of 326 is considerably more planar than that of the corresponding SubPc, as evidenced by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The SubPc and SubPz bowl depths of 326 (R = Ph) are of 2.185 Å and 1.428 Å, respectively, in the range of that of the SubPc borenium cation.1 The crystal structure also shows the meso-phenyl ring lying orthogonal to the macrocyclic plane. Its broad 1H-NMR signals indicate slow rotation of this group at room temperature. Lowering the temperature leads to sharpening and evidences the magnetic non-equivalence of the concave and convex macrocycle faces.
The optical spectra of 326 are represented in Fig. 92. At first glance, the changes are not as drastic as it could be expected. Both absorbance and fluorescence maxima are blue-shifted by 10–20 nm related to of SubPc, while the Q/B-band ratio decreases, reflecting a tendency towards a porphyrin character. Moreover, the reduced symmetry is manifested through splitting of the absorption bands.

4. Subnaphthalocyanines
4.1 Synthesis and reactivity of subnaphthalocyanines
Subnaphthalocyanines (SubNcs) are curved, aromatic macrocycles, consisting of three benzoisoindole subunits connected through their 1,3-positions by aza-bridges. The formal addition of three fused benzene rings to a SubPc structure can result in two types of SubNcs, namely, 2,3-SubNcs and 1,2-SubNcs (Fig. 93). The latter exists as two C3 and C1 regioisomers, each one consisting in a pair of enantiomers.
 Fig. 93  Structures of 2,3-subnapthalocyanines and 1,2-subnaphthalocyanines. 
The first example of subnaphthalocyanine is a 2,3-isomer and dates back to 1995.556 Hanack described the cyclotrimerization reaction of naphthalene-2,3-dicarbonitrile, as well as that of its tert-substituted derivative, in the presence of dichloro(phenyl)borane in boiling naphthalene, affording analytical amounts of SubNcs 328 and 330 (Table 12). Both compounds were reported to show absorption bands at 650 and 654 nm, respectively, matching the absorption profile that is currently well-known for these derivatives. The number of publications on SubNcs is roughly one-tenth of that of SubPcs. Therefore, compared to the list of available SubPcs, the number of SubNcs that has been reported is quite limited, although in the last ten years there is an increasing interest in the study of these extended-conjugated analogues for their application in photovoltaics.

The most usual method to prepare 2,3-SubNcs consists in the cyclotrimerization reaction of the corresponding naphthalene-dicarbonitrile derivative in different aromatic solvents (Scheme 30 and Table 12), in the presence of a boron template, which is usually BCl3. The reported yields range from ca. 1% to 80%, depending on the substitution pattern and the reaction conditions. For unsubstituted SubNc 224, multichlorination processes of the aromatic rings occur, usually at the naphthalene bay positions (C4, C9, C16 and their symmetric sites), giving rise to a mixed alloy mixture of SubNc derivatives with different degrees of chlorination (Cl–ClnSubNc), which complete separation is not feasible. Bender has dedicated much work to search for reaction conditions that could inhibit the chlorination processes, without much success.418 In fact, a total occupancy of 0.99–1.13 peripheral chlorines per SubNc molecule,418,444 with an average molecular formula of C36H16.87BCl2.13N6, was determined for 224.418 In general, the use of an electron-poor solvent (nitrobenzene) for the synthesis of Cl–ClnSubNc resulted in the highest degree of bay position chlorination. More recently, bay position bromination has also been detected when attempting to increase the yield of 329 by using a modified version of the Kennedy method, namely, o-dichlorobenzene as reaction solvent.557 Under optimized conditions, 329 was obtained in 32% yield as a Br–BrnSubNc alloy. It is worth noting that it is possible to avoid bay position bromination by employing low temperature synthetic methods, although only analytical amounts of the macrocycle are produced.
 Scheme 30  Synthesis of 2,3-SubNcs. 
Due to the cyclotrimerization conditions, most of SubNcs have been prepared axially substituted with chloride. As for SubPcs, axial substitution by aryloxy groups has been done by treatment with phenol,444,449 pentafluorophenol,444p-tert-butylphenol562 and p-nitrophenol114 in toluene either directly,114,444,449 or by intermediation of the corresponding axial triflate derivative, which is obtained by treatment with silver trifluoromethanesulfonate.562 Moreover, substitution by fluoride is carried out by treatment with AgBF4 in toluene.449,561,563–565
1,2-Subnaphthalocyanines were prepared for the first time by Kobayashi and Nyokong by cyclotrimerization reaction of 1,2-naphthalenedicarbonitrile under standard conditions, giving rise to a 1:3–1:6 mixture of the C3 and C1 regioisomers of 342, which were identify by X-ray diffraction analysis. The four stereoisomers (Scheme 31) could be separated by column chromatography, followed by chiral HPLC.36 A negative CD sign in the Q-band region was found to correspond to a clockwise arrangement of the naphthalene moieties, whereas a positive signal was attributed to an anticlockwise organization. The smaller rotational strengths of the enantiomers of C1-342 compared to those of C3-342 was ascribed by the authors to the reduction of transition magnetic dipole moments of C1-342 due to the presence of an oppositely arranged naphthalene moiety.
The examples of peripheral functionalization of SubNcs by reactions on preformed macrocycles are also very limited. Sonogashira coupling of alkynes with iodo565 or bromo-substituted563 SubNcs has been carried out (Scheme 32).

4.2 Characterization of subnaphthalocyanines

4.2.1 Single-crystal X-ray diffraction. 
The crystal structure of 2,3-SubNcs exhibit the typical cone shape of the SubPc analogues. The depth of the cavity can be characterized by the SubNc bowl-depth, defined by the distance from the mean plane of peripheral six Cf carbons (see Fig. 94) to the center boron atom. The bowl-depth of 224 is of 3.250 Å, deeper than that of SubPcs, owing to the three additional benzene rings that enlarge the π-surface (Table 13). However, the curvature is slightly less pronounced than that of SubPcs, and even less pronounced than that of SubPzs. This is in line with that observed upon annulating peripheral rings to the SubPz structure. Specifically, the average distance between the boron atom and the plane defined by the 3 Np atoms (P1) decreases in the order SubPz (0.62 Å) > SubPc (0.61 Å) > SubNc (0.60 Å). The drop is more evident when compared the SubPz bowl-depth (P2), which decreases in the order SubPz (1.70 Å) > SubPc (1.60 Å) > SubNc (1.50 Å). A similar effect is observed for SubPc bowl-depth (P3): SubPc (2.55 Å) > SubNc (2.40 Å).

The crystal structure of 1,2-SubNc C3-342 exhibits P1, P2 and P3 that are comparable with those of its 2,3-isomers, reflecting a slight planarization of the structure with respect to SubPcs. In contrast, the degree of curvature of C1-342 is slightly higher than the average observed for SubPcs (see Section 2.3.1).


4.2.2 Optical properties. 
When benzene rings are fused to the SubPc structure, there is a narrowing of the HOMO–LUMO gap due to destabilization of the 1a2 HOMO of SubNc, relative to the 1e LUMO and 1a1 MO.566 The effect is smaller in magnitude than that observed on going from SubPz to SubPc, since in SubNc the additional benzene rings lie further from the inner perimeter where the largest MO coefficients are anticipated for the HOMO and LUMO orbitals.566 The effect on the 1a2 MO is originated from an antibonding interaction at the point of attachment of the C4H4 bridges that are added upon annulation of benzene rings. The latter accounts for the absorption features of SubNcs, which show Q-bands at lower energies than those of SubPcs (Fig. 95).

Peripherally unsubstituted SubNcs 224, 359 and 360 display very similar UV-vis spectra, composed for 224 of Soret bands at λmax = 293 and 328 (ε = 47200 and 45000 l mol−1 cm−1, respectively) and a Q-transition at 656 nm (ε = 44700 l mol−1 cm−1), with a shoulder at 594 nm (Fig. 96).184 Additional weaker bands in the 350–500 nm region constitute a significant difference from peripherally unsubstituted SubPcs. The MCD spectrum of 224 (Fig. 96) is dominated by a derivative shaped x/y-polarized A1 term.184 Moreover, peripherally unsubstituted SubNcs fluoresce upon excitation at their Q-band with small Stokes shifts of 30 eV.418

As for SubPcs, axial substitution produces little variation in the optical properties of SubNcs (see Table 14 for comparison). As a general trend, replacement of axial chloride by axial fluoride slightly blue shifts both the Q-band and the λem by 4–6 nm. A similar effect is observed upon substitution by phenoxy or tert-butylphenoxy groups. Other axial aryloxy groups with electron-deficient character, like pentafluorophenoxy or p-nitrophenoxy, do not produce such blue shifts.

Unlike SubPcs, for which the introduction of electron donating or withdrawing groups always produce bathochromic shifts of the Q-bands, the effect of peripheral substitution in SubNcs can produce either red or blue shifts, depending on the nature of the substituent (Table 14). Given the limited catalogue of peripherally substituted SubNcs, building a general trend is not easy, but the available data seem to indicate that substituents functioning essentially as electron acceptors, such as halogens (except fluorine), imides, sulfones, or triple bonds, produce small bathochromic shifts of the SubNc Q-bands. Fluorine, with strong π-donor ability, produce small hypsochromic shifts. Thus, for example, dodecafluorination (SubNcs 333 and 363) produces a 10 nm hypsochromic shift of the SubNc Q-band (contrasting with the 10 nm bathochromic shift produced in SubPcs) and 0–5 nm hypsochromic shift of the SubNc λem. However, dodecachlorination (SubNcs 334 and 362) does not have any noticeable effect on the Q band of SubNc, while it shifts λem 8 nm bathochromically.562 Hexafluorination (SubNc 332) shifts 11 nm both Q and emission bands to higher energies, while the other halogens (SubNcs 336, 338 and 339) do it to lower energies, this effect increasing in the order Cl < Br < I (Fig. 97). Substitution with twelve sulfones produces 21 nm and 36 nm red shift of Q and emission bands, respectively, in SubNc 335, while the effect upon imidation is of 6 and 1 nm, respectively, and 19 nm upon ethynylation (SubNc 353).

Compared to 2,3-SubNcs, 1,2 SubNcs 342 (Fig. 93, Scheme 31) exhibit much smaller red-shifts of 12 nm, related to the corresponding SubPc,36,85 although similar to their 2,3-isomers, they show weak bands in the 350–500 window, at around 390 and 340 nm.


4.2.3 Redox properties. 
SubNc 224 exhibits in DPV three main redox processes, namely two oxidations at +0.26 V and +0.73 V and a reduction at −1.35 V (Table 15). They are, therefore, easier to oxidize and more difficult to reduce electrochemically than the corresponding SubPc. Compared to peripheral substitution, axial ligation has a small effect on the redox properties of SubNcs. For instance, replacing the chloride group in 224 by phenoxy in 359, shifts exclusively the reduction potential cathodic by 180 mV, while substitution with the electron-deficient pentafluorophenoxy moiety makes the reduction of 360 slightly easier than in 359 (50 mV) and the oxidation somewhat more difficult (40 mV). A similar trend is observed upon axial substitution of dodecahalogenated SubNcs with a tert-butylphenoxy group, resulting in moderate cathodic shifts of 110 and 130 mV for the first reduction potential of 362 and 363, related to the corresponding chloro-substituted SubNcs 334 and 333, respectively.

Peripheral functionalization produces more important changes. Dodecachlorination and dodecafluorination makes the oxidation of 334 and 333 by 380 and 360 mV more difficult, respectively, while the reduction is facilitated by 200 and 140 mV, respectively. The highest effect is observed upon dodeca-substitution with sulfones in 335, with the first reduction process 240 mV anodically shifted and no oxidation process detected. Finally, the electron-deficient character of imides serves to make the first reduction process of 340 and 341 by 110–150 mV easier.

5. Subphthalocyanines with annulated rings
There are a few examples of SubPcs containing heterocycles or carbocycles other than benzene, directly fused to the isoindole rings. SubPcs linearly (compounds 368 and 369Fig. 98) or angularly (compounds 370 and 371Fig. 98) annulated with thiazole rings have been prepared by Fülöpova in 19–33% yields under standard cyclotrimerization conditions from the corresponding dinitrile precursors.567 Both types of macrocycles have been obtained as mixtures of the C1 and C3 regioisomers in a nearly statistical 1:3 ratio, except 369, for which a 1:5 ratio was obtained. The resolution of all the C3 enantiomers of 368–371 was accomplished by chiral HPLC, while only the angular C1-370 and 371 could be resolved.
 Fig. 98  Structures of thiazole-SubPcs 368–371. 
All thiazole-SubPcs show red shifted absorption Q-bands indicating extension of the conjugation through the fused heterocycle, and all of them fluoresce when excited at their Q-bands, with small Stokes shifts of 36 meV, and negligible differences between the C1 and C3 isomers. Judging from their higher red shifts, linear compounds (λQ = 603 and 615 nm for C3-368 and C3-369, respectively) seem to have a somewhat more efficient extended-delocalization than their angular isomers (λQ = 589 and 593 nm for C3-370 and C3-371, respectively), although all of them in lower degrees than SubNcs (Fig. 99). Besides, all thiazole-SubPcs show very high singlet oxygen quantum yields. The configuration of the enantiomers has been assigned based in their CD spectra, which show perfect mirror images over the entire absorption window for each pair of enantiomers (Fig. 99).

Angular thiazole-SubPcs 370 and 371 show their electrochemical oxidation process very similar to that of SubPc-Cl 20, ranging from 0.73 to 0.83 V. Linear compounds 368 and 369 are easier to oxidize, with values of 0.50–0.60 V for the first oxidation potential. On the other hand, all linear and angular thiazole-SubPcs are more difficult to reduce, displaying values for their first reduction process of 1.15–1.43 V.
1,3-Dithiole-2-one,544 imide,448 TTF544 and trithiole568 moieties have also been annulated to the SubPc isoindole rings with 14%, 46–55% and 0.7% and 17% yields, respectively, by cyclotrimerization reactions of the corresponding dinitrile derivatives. Annulating imides to the SubPc isoindole rings produces stronger alteration of the optical properties than fusing the same heterocycles to the SubNc skeleton. Thus, for example, the Q-band and emission bands are 26 and 33 nm bathochromically shifted, respectively, upon imidation to SubPc (SubPc 375, Fig. 100), while the effect on SubNc is only of 4 and 10 nm, respectively (SubNc 234, Table 14).

Likewise, annulating 1,3-dithiole-2-one moieties to the SubPz backbone produces stronger impact (30 nm bathochromic shift of the Q-band and fluorescence quenching in SubPz 304, Fig. 87) than fusing the same moieties to SubPc isoindoles (23 and 25 nm red shift of λQ and λem in 378, respectively, Scheme 33).

As an alternative to cyclotrimerization, Furuta and Shimizu have fused TTF moieties to SubPcs (SubPc 380) in 7% overall yield by condensation reaction of tris-(1,3-dithiole-2-one)-SubPc 377 with 4,5-dithiohexyl-1,3-dithiole-2-thione in the presence of P(OEt)3 (Scheme 33).544
The same TTF- and trithiole functionalized phthalonitriles have served to prepare unsymmetric and push–pull SubPcs, respectively, by crossover cyclotrimerization reactions with tetrafluorophthalonitrile.568,569
A series of SubPcs bearing an annulated fluorenone subunit have been prepared in 3–41% by crossover cyclotrimerization reaction of ethyl 2′,3′-dicyano-[1,1′-biphenyl]-2-carboxylate with different phthalonitriles (Scheme 34).570 These compounds show a SubPc bowl-depth of 2.56 Å, similar to that of SubPc. The P and M enantiomers of SubPc 382 were resolved by chiral HPLC. Table 16 summarizes optical and redox properties of SubPcs containing annulated rings.

6. Subporphyrins
6.1 Synthesis of subporphyrins
Discovered in 2007 by Osuka2 and Kobayashi in two independent reports,3,571 Subporphyrins (SubPs) constitute the youngest members of the Subporphyrinoid family. SubPs have shown extraordinary structural versatility, which is clearly indicated by the prolific number of reports on SubPs in a relatively short period of time, much higher than those on SubPzs and SubNcs, reported one, two and twelve years before, respectively. A large part of their structural versatility arises from the presence of meso bridges that are an additional functionalization site. Smaller Cpyrr–Cmeso–Cpyrr angles of the trimeric SubPs (ca. 117°) with respect to porphyrins (ca. 127°) provides larger explementary angles and consequently, larger distance between the meso substituents and the adjacent pyrrole rings. As a result, sterically non-congested meso-aryl SubP substituents can rotate freely, allowing their strong electronic coupling to the SubP core and causing large substituent effect.2 The synthesis and properties of SubPs published during the first six years after their discovery have been reviewed by some of us and others in previous works.1,4,5,572 Here, a strong focus is given on the synthesis of SubP. Besides, the present review intends to offer a general picture of the chemistry and properties of SubPs, in particular, the effects of substitution in the structure and properties of these macrocycles. Therefore, we will emphasize new results that have appeared in the last eight years, but will also include some relevant aspects already discussed in the previous reviews.
The photophysical and photochemical properties, as well as some applications of SubPs, have been studied in detail by Kim and Osuka,573–576 among others.45,577–579
Tribenzosubporphyrins (BzSubP) axially substituted by a hydroxy group are prepared by cyclotrimerization of different isoindolinone precursors a–c (Scheme 35).7 Unsubstituted BzSubP 387, which constituted the first example of Subporphyrin, was reported by Osuka and co-workers in ∼1.4% yield through a modified Gouterman's protocol,580 consisting of treatment of the isoindolinone a with a boron template species, such as boric acid, or phenylboronic acid, or 4-methoxyphenylboronic acid, under an inert atmosphere, at 350 °C or under microwave irradiation (Scheme 35). The meso-phenyl-substituted derivatives such as 388 were reported soon after by Kobayashi, Luk’yanets and co-workers in ∼8% yields by boron templated cyclotrimerization of the isoindolinone b, or by condensation of phthalimide c with phenylacetic581 or 2,6-dichlorophenylacetic acids.582
 Scheme 35  The synthesis of BzSubPs 387 and 388. 
The axial hydroxy groups can be replaced with alkoxy, carbonyloxy or silyloxy moieties, upon treatment with the corresponding alcohol,581,583 carboxylic acid,7,583 or triphenylsilyl chloride,581 respectively.
Contrary to the methods to prepare all triaza-subporphyrinoids (i.e. SubPcs, SubPzs, SubNcs and most of their analogues) and BzSubPs, which are all based on boron template cyclizations of three monomeric units, namely, dicyano- and isoindolinone-derivatives, the synthetic procedures for the assembly of the SubP backbone consist in the ring closure of different trimeric intermediates d–f (Scheme 36).
 Scheme 36  Synthetic procedures for the preparation of SubPs. 
Symmetric SubPs with C3 symmetry, bearing identical pyrrole and meso-substituents (A3 type SubPs, Ar1 = Ar2 = Ar3 in Scheme 36) are usually prepared through methods developed independently by the groups of Kobayashi and Osuka, consisting of Adler reaction of preformed tripyrrolylborane derivatives d or e (Scheme 36).2,3,571 A less conventional method is based on the metathesis-type transformation of a [32]heptaphyrin derivative.584 For the synthesis of unsymmetrically substituted SubPs of A2B (Ar1 = Ar2 ≠ Ar3 in Scheme 36) or ABC-types (Ar1 ≠ Ar2 ≠ Ar3 in Scheme 36), the in situ aroylation of a tri-N-tripyrromethene precursor generated from tripyrrane f, followed by intramolecular cyclization (Scheme 36) is the most convenient procedure.585

6.1.1 Synthesis of symmetric A3-type subporphyrins. 
As stated above, the general procedures for the preparation of A3-SubPs involve Adler reactions of a tripyrrolylborane derivative of d and e types, with arylaldehydes. By using these methods, meso-aryl substituted SubPs are obtained in yields ranging from 1 to 10%.1,5Table 17 shows selected examples of SubPs that have been prepared by Adler reactions. For a more detailed list see ref. 1 and 5. Derivatives 389, 391–394 have been prepared by method A, which involves treatment of tri(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)borane (d) with the corresponding aryl aldehyde in refluxing propionic acid.3,571 Method B uses N-pyridine-tri(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)borane (e) for the Adler reaction. The optimized conditions consist of condensation of e with an aryl aldehyde in 1,2-dichlorobenzene at 0 °C, in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid under nitrogen, followed by TFA quenching and oxidation at reflux temperature.2 Examples of SubPs prepared by method B are 395–398, 405, 406 and 408. Method C consists of a modification of method B that includes an additional oxidation step with MnO2, which results in increased yields via smooth oxidation of subchlorin formed as a byproduct in the cyclotrimerization step to the corresponding SubP.586–589 A, B and C procedures provide SubPs in their axially substituted hydroxo forms (R = H in Scheme 36), which are usually converted into the corresponding methoxo SubPs by treatment with MeOH (Scheme 37). By applying the methods A, B or C, a variety of meso-triaryl substituted SubPs have been prepared. The nature of the aryl substituents is versatile, including substituted benzene rings,2,3,571,587,588 heterocycles like pyridine,3,571 thiophene,586 benzo[b]thiophene,586 mono-,579 oligo-590 or dendritic591 carbazole, or ferrocene moieties592 (Table 17 and ref. 1 and 5).

 Scheme 37  Axial substitution of hydroxo-SubPs with alcohols. 
Syntheses of β-substituted SubPs are mostly carried out by initial β-halogenation followed by nucleophilic substitution reactions. So far, there has been only one report on direct cyclotrimerization reactions of a β-substituted tripyrrolylborane derivative 410 (Scheme 38) by Panda that afford β-hexaethylated SubPs 411 and 412 in 8 and 5% yield, respectively.594 SubP 411, containing phenyl-substituted meso-positions, has been obtained from 410 by applying general method B. In addition, pyridine-tri-N-(3,4-diethylpyrrolyl)borane (410) has been condensed with trioxane, in the presence of catalytic methanesulfonic acid, affording the meso-unsubstituted SubP 412.594
 Scheme 38  Synthesis of meso-phenyl substituted (411) and unsubstituted (412) β-hexaethyl-SubPs by direct Adler reaction from pyridine-tri-N-(3,4-diethylpyrrolyl)borane (410). 
The other example of meso-free A3 SubP 415 has been prepared from the f type tripyrrane 413, by reaction with triethylamine borane, to afford the corresponding tri-N-tripyrromethene complex 414, which is in situ condensed with boiling triethyl orthoformate (Scheme 39).595
 Scheme 39  Synthesis of meso-unsubstituted SubP 415. 
A less common procedure to prepare A3-SubPs consists of a transannular metathesis-type transformation, in which a SubP is extruded from a [32]heptaphyrin derivative upon cooperative metalation with Cu(II) and B(III), affording a copper(II) porphyrin as a by-product (Scheme 40).584 The method has allowed to prepare meso-perfluorinated SubPs 418584 and 419596 in 36 and 6% yields, respectively. Both SubPs are hitherto not accessible through the tripyrrolylborane-based protocols. However, the scope of the procedure is very limited by the scarce diversity available in the substitution of the [32]heptaphyrin precursors, which is reduced to 2,6-dichlorophenyl597 and 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl-meso-moieties,598 besides the above-mentioned pentafluorophenyl and trifluoromethyl groups.
 Scheme 40  Preparation of SubPs 418 and 419 by metathesis of [32]heptaphyrins. 


6.1.2 Synthesis of unsymmetric A2B-type and ABC-type subporphyrins. 
A2B-type meso-aryl-SubPs have been prepared by cross Adler reaction of the pyridine-tri-N-pyrrolylborane precursor e (Scheme 36) with a stoichiometric mixture of benzaldehyde and p-bromobenzaldehyde under the conditions of method C. This afforded four SubPs, namely AAA, AAB, ABB and BBB, as a non-separable mixture.599 Subsequent derivatizations of the crude by Sonogashira ethynylation,599 Ni-catalyzed homocoupling,583 or Buchwald–Hartwig amination,600 afforded the corresponding mixture of compounds, from which different A3, B3, A2B and AB2-SubPs were separated by the standard chromatographic techniques. Method B using 4-(diphenylamino)benzaldehyde and 4-formylbenzoic acid was also the choice to prepare a push–pull SubP that has been designed as photosensitizer for photoelectrochemical water oxidation.578
A more rational approach to prepare unsymmetrically substituted SubPs involves the preparation of a triethylamino tripyrromethene borane intermediate (g, Scheme 41) by reaction of a f-type tripyrrane with BH3·NEt3, followed by in situ aroylation with aroyl chloride with concomitant ring closure. This method has been demonstrated to be very effective for the synthesis of versatile symmetric and unsymmetric SubPs, since the access to various f-type intermediates is relatively simple and SubPs can be constructed in a controlled manner. However, the Adler reaction from tri(1H-pyrrol-1-yl)borane precursors still constitutes the most usual access to symmetric SubPs. Table 18 compiles A3, A2B and ABC SubPs that have been directly prepared by following the reactions shown in Scheme 41. R1 and R2meso-substituents arising from tripyrrane f can be the same or different and comprise H, ester functions and a variety of phenyl rings with different substitution patterns. Except for compounds with R3 = H, which are prepared by reaction with trimethyl or triethyl orthoformate (Table 18), the reaction of g with different aroyl chloride derivatives functionalized with substituted benzene rings, as well as thiophene or naphthalene rings, has provided a wide assortment of SubPs, which can be further manipulated by conventional organic chemistry for different purposes, as we will discuss next sections.

6.2 Reactivity of subporphyrins
Stepwise approaches enable the synthesis of SubPs containing hydrogen, carboxylic esters, some heterocycles, or aryl groups at the meso-positions, while peripheral β-modifications of SubPs have been somewhat left behind, except for two examples of β-hexaethylSubPs.594 The axial position can be another candidate for the fabrication of SubPs. In the beginning of SubP studies an axial methoxy substituent had been often used, since it facilitates the isolation and purification of the compounds owing to the chemical stabilities of methoxo-SubPs. We will discuss the chemistry of SubPs bearing axial substituents other than methoxy group in Section 6.2.2.

6.2.1 Reactivity at the peripheral and meso positions. 
Peripheral functionalization of SubPs has been started by halogenation reactions, namely bromination, chlorination or iodination with usual halogenation reagents such as NBS, Br2, and NCS. Then, nucleophilic aromatic substitution and Pd catalyzed coupling reactions of β-halogenated SubPs have given versatile β-halogenated SubPs.608 Actually, hexabrominated-609,610h and hexachlorinated-SubPs i611 have been used as intermediates of a variety of peripherally substituted SubPs (Scheme 42).
 Scheme 42  Peripheral hexafunctionalization of SubPs. 
Hexabrominated SubPs h were subjected to Suzuki–Miyaura and Stille coupling to provide compounds 454–459 and trifluoromethylation to give 464–466 in good to very good yields, while non-catalyzed nucleophilic aromatic substitutions (SNAr) were performed on SubP i affording hexasulfanylated compounds 460–463 (Table 19) in 74–95% yields. Furthermore, controlled halogenation followed by sulfanylation, or palladium catalyzed amination reactions gave to SubPs bearing one peripheral sulfanyl (467),611 amine (469–472) or amide functions (473) (Fig. 101).612 In addition, oxidation of the peripheral thioether of 467 with MCPBA provided a diastereomeric mixture of the corresponding sulfoxides 468 (Fig. 101).613 A hydroxy group,614 as well as a trifluoromethyl and other perfluorinated functions, have also been introduced through monobromo-SubPs.610

 Fig. 101  Examples of peripherally monofunctionalized SubPs. 
A procedure to peripherally nitrated SubPs consists of treatment of 409 with Cu(NO3)2, a milder nitration reagent, to give β-nitrated SubP 475 (Scheme 43), and subsequent hydrogenation afforded β-aminated SubP 476.612
 Scheme 43  Peripheral nitration and amination of SubPs. 
Ir-catalyzed β-selective borylations of meso-free porphyrins have been extensively studied to create various β-substituted porphyrins and β–β linked cyclic porphyrin rings.615,616 This reaction was found to be similarly effective for meso-free SubP. Under the similar reaction conditions, meso-free SubP 438 was converted to diborylated SubPs j in 85–94% yield, which have been shown to be valuable synthetic precursors of β-functionalized macrocycles through Suzuki–Miyaura coupling (Scheme 44 and Table 20).617,618 In addition, Cu-mediated iodine exchange reaction results in the diiodo SubP 478, which has in turn been converted into the corresponding β,β′-dideuterated (487), diformylated (488) and diiminylated SubPs (489).

The β-borylation reaction of 438 can be carried out in a controlled manner, by treatment with 0.8 equivalents of (Bpin)2 in the presence of a catalytic amount of [Ir(cod)OMe]2 and dtbpy.619 The resulting monoborylated SubP has been used as synthetic precursor of meso-to-meso SubP dimers, which will be discussed in Section 6.4.2.
Introduction of specific substituents at the meso-positions is beneficial in creating new functional SubPs, since the electronic nature of the SubP is largely perturbed by the strong substituent effects.620 This is due to the smaller rotational barrier of the meso-aryl substituents in SubPs as compared with that of porphyrins. Therefore, meso-functionalization can be used in SubPs, not only for structural purposes, but also for designing systems with specific redox and optical properties.
The functionalization at the SubP meso-positions can be performed by chemical manipulations of preformed meso-substituted SubPs. This strategy has been used to functionalize macrocycles with alkyl groups, amines, or conjugated systems containing oligothiophene, oligophenylene and oligo(1,4-phenyleneethynylene) branches. For example, meso-alkyl SubPs have been prepared in 43–50% yield by desulfurization of meso-thienyl SubPs, like for example 400 and 401 (Table 17), using RANEY® nickel to lead the corresponding alkyl-substituted SubPs (Scheme 45).1,586
 Scheme 45  Synthesis of meso-trialkylSubPs 490 and 491. 

meso-Aminophenyl-substituted SubPs 492 and 493 (Fig. 102) have been prepared in quantitative yields by reduction with SnCl2 in HCl of the corresponding nitrophenyl-SubPs,573,588 or by Pd-catalyzed reduction with sodium borohydride.595 The primary amine can be further removed by diazotization reaction followed by treatment with aqueous hypophosphorous acid.595 Functionalization with amines can also be done by palladium catalyzed Buchwald–Hartwig reaction of the corresponding brominated meso-aryl SubPs with amines. Some examples are constituted by meso-(4-(N,N-dibenzylamino)phenyl)- (494–496), and aza-crown substituted (497) SubPs (Fig. 102).600 SubP 493 can also be obtained by Buchwald–Hartwig amidation of the corresponding brominated SubP with benzamide, followed by hydrolysis.588
 Fig. 102  SubPs containing meso-aminophenyl substituents. 
Thiophene derived SubP 400 (Table 17) has been brominated at the thiophene rings with NBS,621 and the resulting SubP 256, together with the bromophenyl-SubP 395 (Scheme 46), have been used as precursors of extended-conjugated systems by means of Sonogashira or Suzuki couplings (Scheme 46). Some examples include 5,10,15-tris-oligo(1,4-phenyleneethynylene) substituted SubPs (498–502) for two-photon-absorption applications,622 tris-oligo-(1,4-phenyl) macrocycles 503 and 504,623 as well as tris-oligo-2,5-thienylene-substituted SubPs 505–507 (Table 21).621 These types of palladium catalyzed coupling reactions are also very useful to assemble multimacrocyclic and multichromophore systems, which will be discussed in Section 6.4.

Other modifications of meso-substituents include oxidation of alkyl substituents at the benzylic position to give a meso-carbonyl SubP,586 quaternization of pyridyl substituents in 391 and 393 (Table 17) by alkylation with MeI,577,624 hydrolysis of esters,576 and Knoevenagel condensation.576
SubPs bearing a halogen atom, namely, bromine (508) or chlorine (509), directly attached to the meso-position constitute versatile platforms for introducing a variety of functional groups by C–C, C–heteroatom or C–metal bond formation. Both A2B halogenated intermediates have been prepared by bromination or chlorination with NBS or NCS, respectively, of the meso-free SubP 429 (Scheme 47).

Bromo-SubP 508 has been employed in palladium catalyzed coupling reactions including Negishi, Suzuki–Miyaura and Sonogashira couplings,576,601 amination (i.e. Zhang protocol),625,626 alkoxylation, sulfanylation or phosphorylation reactions.627 SubP 508 has been also borylated with Bpin and subsequently used in Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reactions.593 Besides, treatments of 508 with nitrogen-, oxygen- and sulphur-based nucleophiles serve to prepare the corresponding meso-substituted amine-, ether or thioether SubPs, respectively, through Pd-free SNAr-type reactions.608,628 Except for electron-deficient amines, the catalyst-free protocol is more efficient for amination and aryloxylation reactions, while the Pd-catalyzed sulfanylations usually work better. SNAr reaction is also the method used to introduce diarylamines and heteroarenes. Likewise, carbon-nucleophiles such as the malononitrile anion have been used in SNAr reactions on 508.629 Chlorinated intermediate 509 can also be used SNAr-amination reactions, being typically more reactive in amination processes implying electron-deficient amines.628,630Table 22 lists all the SubP derivatives obtained by these procedures.

The reaction of SubPs with electrophilic reagents is another route to functionalize the meso-positions. meso-LithioSubPs can be generated by bromine-lithium exchange of bromo-SubP derivatives such as 508 through treatment with n-Buli at −98 °C. The resulting organolithium species can be trapped with different electrophiles, such as benzophenone, DMF, CO2, chlorotrimethylsilane, N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide and mesitylboryl fluoride, giving rise to the corresponding meso-functionalized SubPs 546–552 (Table 22).631

meso-Nitro SubPs 555 and 556 were prepared by nitration reaction of meso-free SubPs 429 and 445 with AgNO2 and I2 and were reduced to meso-amino SubPs 557 and 558 with NaBH4 and Pd/C, respectively (Scheme 48).606,632
 Scheme 48  
meso-Amino SubPs 557 and 558. 
Some meso- and peripheral substituents may be cyclized at the adjacent position to afford fused SubPs. For example, SubP 560 bearing a fused thiochromane has been prepared from meso-2-bromophenylsulfanyl-substituted SubP 559 by intramolecular Pd-catalyzed C–H activation reaction (Scheme 49).628 A related SubP 564 (Scheme 49) bearing a fused pyran ring has been synthesized in 14% overall yield by cleavage of the methoxy group of SubP 431 with BBr3, giving a hydroxy group, followed by perbromination and intramolecular ether formation in the presence of potassium carbonate.633 Similarly, SubP 562, containing two fused dihydroquinoline rings, has been obtained by a double cyclization of the aryl groups in the β,β-diiodo-meso-diarylamino subporphyrin SubP 561. The latter entails a radical-nucleophilic substitution reaction (SRN1) involving stable radical intermediates that are generated by single electron transfer from tert-butoxide or diarylamide anions to the SubP, with concomitant loss of iodide ions of 561.634
 Scheme 49  SubPs with fused heterocycles at the meso,β-positions. 
A few cyclometalated subporphyrin complexes wherein the metals are coordinated either to the meso- or the β-pyrrole positions have been reported. The former are constituted by the NCN-type pincer complexes 565 and 566 (Fig. 103) that have been prepared by metalation of the meso-free 486 with palladium and platinum salts, respectively,618 as well as the earring complex 567,635 which has been obtained by treatment of the corresponding meso-free ligand with Pd(OAc)2.
 Fig. 103  Structures of pincer (565 and 566) and earring (567) meso-metallated SubPs, and β-pyrrole metalated SubPs 568 and 569. 
When the meso-position is substituted with a 2-pyridine ligand such as SubP 545, iridium complexation takes place by treatment with [Cp*IrCl2]2, producing C–H activation of the adjacent pyrrole β-positions to give a mixture of regioisomers 568-exo and 568-endo in a 72/28 ratio.593 Likewise, Ir(III) metalation of the corresponding trispyridyl-SubP 408 proceeds quite cleanly, producing exclusively C3-symmetric SubP 569.593


6.2.2 Reactivity at the axial position. 
Most of SubPs are reported as methoxo-compounds that are obtained by treatment with MeOH, as one of the last steps in the synthesis of SubPs. This contrasts with axial ligand exchange reactions of SubPcs, which typically require more forcing conditions.68 The axial hydroxo- or methoxo-groups can easily be replaced by any other alkoxy or carbonyloxy groups, for different purposes, for example, to obtain single crystals that can be studied by XR diffraction,586 or to endow the molecule with additional functionalities, such as a thiol group.636 This process can be reverted to the axial hydroxy SubP by simply washing the B-alkoxy and B-carbonyloxy subporphyrin with aqueous HCl. Interestingly, bowl-inversion has been observed in some SubPs containing a chiral sulfinyl substituent at one of the β-positions, upon treatment with alcohols at different temperatures. The latter strongly suggests the formation of a borenium cation intermediated SN1-type mechanism for axial exchange reactions in protic solvents.613
As for subazaporphyrins,159 fluoro-substituted SubPs are prepared by treatment of the hydroxo-form with BF3·OEt2 (Scheme 50).610,637 Both alkoxylation and fluorination reactions occur in quantitative yields and are reversible under acidic conditions. Fluoro-substituted SubPs are quite less polar than the corresponding hydroxo-SubPs, providing an alternative tool, complementary to the methoxo-substitution, for their isolation.
 Scheme 50  Fluoride substitution of SuPs at their axial positions. 
SubPs bearing a B–C bond are prepared in 60–90% yields by reaction of the corresponding methoxo-SubPs with excess Grignard reagents (Scheme 51 and Table 23, methods A and B),606,638 or in 50–80% yields by treatment with the less nucleophilic arylzinc reagents (method C).639 The latter allows the axial substitution with functional groups that are not compatible with conditions of methods A and B, such as nitrile, ketone, ester, or halogens. The axial substituents may be further manipulated by standard organic chemistry, constituting an excellent platform, complementary to meso and peripheral substitution, to endow the SubPs with additional properties, such as in compounds 592–596 (Fig. 104), obtained in one step from compounds 588, 589 and 590, respectively.626,639 Methods A–C constitute an interesting and versatile alternative to the previously reported method D (Table 23) involving the intermediation of a borenium cation.640

SubP B-hydrides 597–599 have been prepared in moderate to very good yields by reaction of methoxo-SubPs with DIBAL-H.641 The hydride 597 can be hydrolyzed to give hydroxo-SubP 389, or used in hydroboration reactions of aldehydes and imines, affording the corresponding alkoxo- and amino-SubPs 600 and 601 (Scheme 52).
 Scheme 52  Generation, hydrolysis and hydroboration reactions of SubP-hydrides. 
Axial peroxides 602–604 have been synthesized by treatment of methoxo-SubP 390 with hydrogen peroxide, tert-butyl peroxide, and MCPBA, respectively, in fairly good yields (Scheme 53). Subsequent heating of the peroxide 602 gave peroxo-bridged subporphyrin dimer 605 in 97% yield.642 This reactivity of 602 contrasts with that of 389 and may be ascribed to higher nucleophilic character of the B-hydroperoxide moiety. In addition, dimer 605 was stable towards hydrolysis, contrasting with the corresponding SubP μ-oxodimer that was quickly hydrolyzed in the presence of water. Peroxides 603 and 604 did not undergo similar thermal dimerization, suggesting that the formation of 605 may involve nucleophilic trapping of a borenium cation intermediate.

6.3 Characterization of subporphyrins

6.3.1 Single-crystal X-ray diffraction. 
Almost all the structures of key SubPs have been revealed by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. SubP 415 shows a curved and conical structure, similar to those of all the other subporphyrinoids, with B–N and B–O distances of 1.50–1.51 and 1.44 Å, respectively, and a bowl-depth of 1.51 Å (Fig. 105).595 The latter characterizes the degree of curvature of SubPs, which is defined by the distance from the mean plane of the peripheral six β-pyrrolic carbons to the central boron atom. Compared to SubPzs (1.76 Å bowl-depth) and SubPcs (2.55 Å bowl-depth),76 the conical structure of SubPs is considerably shallower.159

As a general trend, the curvatures for substituted SubPs are slightly smaller than that of unsubstituted SubP 415, and depend on the axial, meso- and β-substituents, as well as crystal packing manners. Thus, for example, introducing one (SubP 606), or two (SubP 430) phenyl substituents at one or two of the meso-positions slightly flattens the molecule to bowl depth values of 1.42 and 1.46 Å, respectively, while the curvature of the corresponding triphenyl-substituted SubP 390 is of 1.29 Å (Table 24 and Fig. 105). Comparable effects are observed upon trialkyl (SubP 491)586 or bis ethoxycarbonyl (SubP 437) meso-substitution.603 Functionalizing at the six β-pyrrole positions with ethyl groups (SubP 412) or fusing benzene rings at the same positions (BzSubP 387) also reduces the SubP bowl depths (1.43 Å and 1.32 Å, respectively). The corresponding meso-triphenyl-substituted SubPs 411 and 388 are still shallower (1.16 and 1.18 Å, respectively), reflecting the smaller curvatures of SubPs fully substituted at both meso- and β-positions (see Table 24 SubPs 411, h, 457, 459, 455, 460, 461, 462, 463 and 388). In this respect, compound 461, containing three meso-phenyl substituents and six tert-butylsulfanyl groups at the β-positions, shows a curvature of 1.04 Å,611 which represents the smallest bowl-depth among all the reported neutral SubPs.

Differently, SubPs contain fused rings involving both meso-and β-positions, such as 562 (Scheme 49), or the corresponding metallacycles 568 and 569 (Fig. 103), are forced to take large bowl depths of around 1.63, 1.52 and 1.56 Å, respectively.593,634
A distinctive feature of SubPs with respect to their triaza-SubPc and SubPz congeners, and even to the corresponding porphyrins, is the strong interaction produced by the meso-aryl substituents with the aromatic SubP core and hence, stronger influence of these substituents on the macrocyclic electronic properties. meso-Phenyl SubPs 606, 430, 390, 508, 585, 597, 570, 637, 602, 603 and 604 lacking β-substituents (Table 24) display relatively small dihedral angles that range only between 38.1–52.0°, contrasting with those of 5,10,15,20-tetraarylporphyrins, which usually exhibit larger dihedral angles (>60°). Substitution of the meso-rings at para- or meta-positions (SubPs 397 and 407, respectively) produce SubPs with similar dihedral angles (Table 24). However, meso-aryl groups containing ortho-substituents, like in 399 and 418 (Table 24), show larger dihedral angles (61.0–79.0°) due to the steric hindrance of the ortho-substituents,2,584 these effects being even larger (78–82°) for the corresponding porphyrins.643 Other aromatic meso-rings such as thienyl- (SubP 401) or pyridyl (SubP 166) also display small dihedral angles allowing their strong electronic conjugation with the SubP core. On the opposite side are fully substituted SubPs such as 411, h, 459, 454, 460, 461, 462, 463 and BzSubP 388, which are sterically congested and so, accommodate the meso-aryl substituents almost perpendicular to the SubP core, exhibiting larger dihedral angles of 64.60–84.5°. Remarkably, the dihedral angles between the SubPs and the terminal aryl groups with the arylalkynyl- or the arylvinyl-groups (compounds 513, 512 and 454; Table 24) are considerably small, running from 14.6° to 31.6°, and indicating extended conjugation through the vinyl and ethynyl linkers.601,609
The aromaticity of SubPs is manifested in their crystal structure by the little bond length alternation in the macrocycle, although the situation for their aromatic substituents may be different. meso-4-Aminophenyl-substituted SubPs 493 and 496 (Fig. 102), for example, show a quinonoid-type bond alternation,1,573,599 in addition to low dihedral angles (41.2–58.6° for 493 and 42.7–48.6° for 496), indicating strong interactions between the meso-(4-aminophenyl) substituent and the SubP core.573,600
SubPs 523, 524 and 543 (Table 22), bearing one primary arylamino group directly attached to one of the meso-positions, show strong electronic interaction between the arylamino substituent and the SubP core.625,630 In these cases, π-donation from the amine to the SubP produces a resonance structure in which the Cmeso–N distances become shorter. This is reflected in the crystal structures of these compounds as seen by the unusually short Cmeso–N distances of 1.393, 1.374 and 1.365 Å, respectively (1.402–1.417 Å for usual C–N bonds). Likewise, SubPs 536, 537 and 538 (Table 22) containing a secondary diarylamino moiety exhibit Cmeso–N bond lengths that are shorter than Cipso–N bond lengths, suggesting a double bond character as well, which increases in the order 536 < 537 < 538 in accordance with the donor character of the diarylamino group.628 The shortest Cmeso–N distance (1.347 Å) is observed for SubP 557 bearing a primary amine directly attached to the meso-position.632 Conversely, for 4-nitrophenylamino-substituted compound 525 (Table 22) the Cmeso–N distance is of 1.405 Å, while Cipso–N distance is of 1.379 Å. The latter is thought to reflect a higher contribution of a resonance structure in which the meso-nitrogen is π-donating to the benzene ring owing to the presence of the nitro electron-attracting substituent.625
Similar effects are observed in meso-alkoxy substituted SubP 527, wherein Cmeso–O distance is of 1.455 Å, while Cipso–O distance is of 1.265 Å.627 The corresponding thioether 531, however, exhibits almost identical Cmeso–S and Cipso–S distances (1.761 and 1.764 Å, respectively), reflecting the significantly lower donor character of the sulfur atom.627 On the other hand, when the nitrogenated meso-substituents are pyrrole, indole or carbazole derivatives (SubPs 540–542) the Cmeso–N bond lengths significantly increase to 1.421–1.430 Å, suggesting much weaker or negligible electron-pair donating interactions of the meso-substituents.628meso-Nitrated SubPs 555 and 556, on the other hand, exhibits an even longer Cmeso–N distance of 1.431–1.436 Å.606,632
With respect to β-substitution, nitro and amino-SubPs 475 and 476 (Scheme 43), display short Cβ–N bond lengths of 1.399 and 1.336 Å, respectively, indicating strong interaction with the SubP ring.612 Besides, the Cβ–S distances in β-substituted hexasulfanyl-SubPs 461 and 462 show slightly shorter values of 1.750–1.759 Å related to the corresponding Cipso–S distances (1.772–1.790 Å).611,613


6.3.2 Rotational dynamics of meso-aryl-substituents. 
The rotational dynamics of SubP meso-substituents has been examined2,609 and previously reviewed.1meso-Aryl substituents of SubPs have lower rotational barriers. Since the SubP convex and concave faces are nonequivalent, the rotation of meso-phenyl groups can be studied by 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Thus, for example, meso-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-SubP 398 displays the same chemical shift for Hexo and Hendo protons, as diagnostic of fast rotation of the meso-aryl substituents in the 1H-NMR timescale. In contrast, even at 130 °C, meso-(2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl)-SubP 399 exhibits different signals for its corresponding Hexo and Hendo protons, indicating a larger rotational barrier of the meso-aryl groups. The coalescence temperatures and (ΔGROT) of the meso-aryl substituents for SubPs h, 454–459 have been previously determined.609
More recently, the rotational dynamics of SubPs 431, 432, 433, 434, and 435 have been studied by VT 1H-NMR spectroscopy. In order to lower the rapid rotational barrier, the corresponding axially substituted SubP-Ph derivatives were prepared using phenylmagnesium bromide.
In the 1H-NMR spectrum of 431 at 20 °C, the signals of the 2-methoxy protons are observed as two separate broad signals that sharpen at −40 °C, appearing at 4.04 and 3.53 ppm with a 56:44 ratio. These peaks have been assigned to the Hexo- and Hendo-protons of the corresponding atropisomers, respectively,602 which were found to coalesce at 35 °C. The rotation rate constant of the 2-methoxyphenyl group at each temperature has been estimated to be of 13, 340, and 4000 s−1 at −20, 20, and 60 °C, respectively. From these rate constants, the activation parameters of the rotation of the 2-methoxyphenyl group in 431 have been determined and the same method has been applied for the other SubPs. A comparison of the rotation activation parameters of 431–435 revealed variable contributions of ΔH‡ and ΔS‡ to ΔG‡ with the following consequences:
(1) The rotational barriers of SubP-Ph derivatives are smaller than those of SubP-OMe species.
(2) Ethoxy (190) and isopropoxy groups (433) exert similar ΔG‡298 values, which are larger than that of a methoxy group (431); among 432 and 433, the rotation of the 2-isopropoxy aryl group occurs via a pre-ordered transition state with less enthalpic cost.
(3) Alkyl group in 435 restricts the rotation of the meso-aryl groups much more than alkoxy groups.
(4) The chloro group at the 4-position in SubP-Ph 434 does not influence the rotational dynamics. However, good π-electron donor groups such as amino groups tend to lower ΔG‡298, probably due to electronic stabilization of the coplanar rotation transition state.
The rotational dynamics of meso-substituents in SubPs β-substituted with thioethers has also been studied.6111H-NMR studies indicate that the meso-phenyl substituents undergo restricted rotation for 460–463. Besides, the β-sulfanyl substituents are conformationally flexible in arylsulfanyl 460 and 461, as well as benzodithio-SubP 463, while are strictly regulated to an anti-conformation in the tert-butylsulfanyl-SubP 462.


6.3.3 Optical properties. 
SubP 415 displays a Soret band at 341 nm arising from a transition that is analogous to the B transition of porphyrins within Gouterman's four-orbital model. In addition, a vibronic structure appears as two absorption bands at 432 and 455 nm with an order of magnitude less intense than the B band (Fig. 106), which correspond to Q-like transitions within Gouterman's four-orbital model.644 The Soret-like band of SubPs is progressively red shifted upon substitution at the meso-positions with phenyl rings, and the same occurs for the Q-absorptions. Thus, SubPs 606, 430 and 390 (Table 25) exhibit their corresponding B-bands at 352, 362 and 373 nm, respectively, while the Q-bands appear at, 440 and 461, 450 and 461, and 484 nm, respectively, indicating electronic interaction of the meso-phenyl groups with the SubP core. The latter has been attributed to smaller steric hindrance around the meso-phenyl groups in SubPs related to the corresponding tetraphenylporphyrins,595 which leads to a substantial electronic conjugation of the aromatic meso-rings to the SubP core in meso-phenyl and thienyl-SubPs 390 and 421, contrasting with porphyrins, for which this conjugation is only marginal.

The normalized fluorescence spectra of 415, 606, 430, and 390 are shown in Fig. 106b, revealing emission bands between 450 and 600 nm that have been assigned to S1 fluorescence. Upon sequential addition of meso-phenyl rings the fluorescence spectra show red-shift, with the fluorescence bands mirroring the respective Q-like bands, and Stokes shifts gradually higher of 150, 550, 780, and 880 cm−1, respectively.595 When going from 415 to 390 the fluorescence quantum yields (ϕF) decrease, while the fluorescence lifetimes (τF) become elongated in the order 415 = 390 < 606 < 430.
Interestingly, a different fluorescence profile has been observed for 390 at 380–450 nm upon excitation at the B-band at about 350–410 nm (Fig. 107). This fluorescence has been assigned to S2-to-S0 (S2) fluorescence because it is a mirror image of the S2–S0 absorption.575 The observation of the dual fluorescence for SubP 390 indicates that these molecules do not obey Kasha's, rule, maybe due to a large energy gap between the S1 and S2 states of SubPs. β-Hexaethyl SubP 411 does not show any discernible S2 emission, while the corresponding meso-unsubstituted SubP 412 does it upon excitation at its Soret band.594

KGaA, Weinheim. 
As a general trend, any functionalization of the SubP skeleton at the meso- and/or β-positions cause red shifts both at B and Q absorption bands with respect to the unsubstituted 415 (Fig. 109a). The only exceptions to this rule are constituted by meso-trifluoromethyl-substituted SubP 419 and β-ethyl-substituted SubP 412, as specified below. Typically, SubP derivatives display their B-band in the 340–380 nm region and their Q-band in the 400–540 nm region (Table 25). Therefore, absorptions of SubPs lie at considerably shorter wavelengths (ca. 30–50 and 70–100 nm, respectively) than the corresponding bands of the metallated tetraphenylP (ca. 410–420 and 500–610 nm). This blue shift arises from the smaller π-electronic circuit of SubPs (14π-electrons) related to Zn(II)tetraphenylP (18π-electrons). Besides, the absorption coefficient of the SubP Soret band is ca. 25% that of Zn(II)tetraphenylP in the same solvent.2,3 The smeared vibronic structure in Q-like absorption and broad fluorescence bands seem to arise from the bowl-shaped SubP core in contrast to the comparatively flat structure of Zn(II)tetraphenylP (Fig. 108).3

SubPs usually exhibit green fluorescence in a range of 470–670 nm with the main peak observed in the 508–543 nm region (Table 25). Stokes shifts are in a range of 700–2950 cm−1 and fluorescence quantum yields are larger than those of Zn(II) tetraphenyl porphyrins (Fig. 109).

meso-Alkyl substituents also shift the absorption bands to the red (360, 450, 472 nm) in 491, although in lesser extent than triphenylation. The Stokes shift value is also small (489 cm−1), probably reflecting a smaller radiative chromophore size. A similar effect is observed upon substitution with two carboxylic esters at the meso-positions in SubP 437 (362, 476, 505 nm).603 However, an electron withdrawing alkyl chain such as the trifluoromethyl-derivative 419 causes the opposite effect, with a Soret band at 341 nm, similar to that of unsubstituted SubP. In this case, however, Q-bands are red-shifted to 443 and 473 nm. The fluorescence spectrum of 419 is also a mirror image of the Q bands, exhibiting the most intense band at 482 nm, while the fluorescence quantum yield is quite small.596
SubP 399, bearing hindered 2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl meso-substituents, represents the second group. This SubP with restricted rotation of their meso-aryl substituents exhibits the Soret band at 372 nm and only one band at 454 nm in the Q-region,1,609 while the fluorescence band appears at 524 nm with a shoulder at 500 nm (Fig. 109). Other SubPs with only one Q-band, or with a very weak Q00 component, bear non-hindered meso groups such as 2-, 3- or 4-pyridyl (408, 393 and 391, respectively),2,593 and p-trifluoromethylphenyl-substituents (394) (Fig. 110).571 It has been suggested that electron-donating groups can give rise to more intense Q00 components than electron-withdrawing groups such as 2-, 3-, or 4-pyridyl, pentafluorophenyl, or trifluoromethylphenyl.2,571,584,593 In agreement with this consideration, 391 displays the weakest Q00 component, while the Q-band of 493, bearing strong π-electron donor amines, appears as a broad absorption at 510 nm, showing the largest increase of the Q00/Q01 ratio (Fig. 110).573 However, the complete rationalization of the optical spectra is more complex, as p-nitrophenyl-meso substituent shows completely different behavior in this respect,2 and axial substituents produce notable alterations in the energy and intensity of the two transitions (see for example Table 25 and ref. 1).593

4-Nitrophenyl-substituted SubP 397 represents the third type, displaying a bathochromically shifted Soret-band at 400 nm and a Q-band in which the Q00 and Q01 components have comparable intensities (Fig. 109).2
As seen for the absorption spectra of meta-substituted SubPs 402 and 492 that are almost identical to those of 390,8 the electronic influences of the meta-nitrophenyl and meta-aminophenyl substituents are almost negligible. Differently, para-nitrophenyl and para-aminophenyl meso-substituents exert remarkable red shifts both in the absorption and fluorescence spectra. While the meso–para-nitrophenyl substituent reduces the fluorescence quantum yield, the meso–para-aminophenyl substituent intensifies the quantum yield.573 As evident in Table 25, these tendencies can be considered as a general behavior of SubPs containing conjugated nitrophenyl and aminophenyl substituents at the meso-positions.
The replacement of meso-phenyl substituents by thienyl substituents, for example in SubPs 401 (Table 25), shifts both Q- and B-bands to red (400 and 534 nm, respectively), indicating again large electronic influences of the meso-thienyl substituents on the SubP core. The fluorescence is observed at 632 nm with a high fluorescence quantum yield of 0.45.586
The π-conjugation of SubPs can be further extended by elongation of three meso-aryl chains by substitution with 1,4-oligophenylene branches (compounds 503 and 504).623 Besides, conjugated systems can be anchored to the SubP meso-positions by using vinylene and ethyne linkers, shifting both B- and Q-bands to lower energies. Because of their lesser steric demand, a sole alkene (compound 512) or alkyne (SubPs 513–520) unit produces considerably stronger effects than the three phenylene units in compounds 503 and 504.
In general, the fluorescence quantum yields also increase in the order 390 ≈ 510 < 503 ≈ 512 ≈ 513 < 504 < 516 ≈ 517, probably as a reflection of the increasing size of the effective radiative chromophore. Comparative effects between non-conjugated (SubPs 510 and 511) and conjugated (SubPs 512–520) meso-substituents are illustrated in Table 25. Other conjugated substituents such as aldehyde and carboxylic acid produce comparable effects in the absorption spectra of SubPs 306 and 307, respectively.631
Diverse heteroatoms directly attached to the meso-positions also cause significant alterations in the absorption and emission spectra of SubP chromophores. In particular, nitro (SubP 555) and amino substituents (SubPs 556, 523–526) cause red shifts in B and Q-absorption bands and fluorescence bands in different extents (Table 25). The nitro substituent leads to quenching the fluorescence quantum yields, as observed for other derivatives. The effects of bromo (508), ether (527, 503), thioether (531, 534) and phosphoryl (535) substituents are much weaker (Table 25), and the absorption spectra of these compounds are comparable to that of 390.627 When a sulfanyl (531 and 534) or phosphoryl (535) group is directly attached at the meso-position, red-shifted absorption and fluorescence spectra are observed with concurrent substantial decreases in the fluorescence quantum yields due to the heavy atom effect.
Ethylation at the six β-pyrrole positions results in blue shifted Soret bands with respect to their related β-free compounds as seen for SubPs 411 and 412 whose Soret bands are observed at 360 and 339 nm, respectively. Curiously, the Q-bands appear blue-shifted to 448 and 471 nm for 411 and red-shifted to 437 and 463 nm for the meso-unsubstituted 412 (Fig. 111). The blue shift in the Soret bands of 411 and 412 has been attributed to the electron-rich ethyl substituents.594 In line with this, the electron-poor β-trifluoromethyl-substituted SubP 464 displays absorption bands at 396, 488, and 518 nm,610 which are considerably red shifted with respect to the unsubstituted SubP 570 (Scheme 50) (369, 456, 480 nm).637 It is probable that the steric congestion between the meso-phenyl rings and β-alkyl substituents reduces effective conjugation of the meso-phenyl substituent, hence causing the observed blue shift of the absorption bands of 411. Contrary to this consideration, the more congested SubPs 456 and 457 containing meso-aryl and β-phenyl substituents display red-shifted B-bands (382 nm) with respect to the β-unsubstituted 401 (373 nm) (Fig. 112).

Steady-state fluorescence spectra of 411 and 412 display clear vibronic structures with peaks at 477 and 507 nm, and 469, 481 and 496 nm, respectively (Fig. 111). The fluorescence spectra are the mirror images of their corresponding Q-bands in the absorption spectra. Small Stokes shifts indicate the structural rigidity of the excited states of these SubPs. The fluorescence quantum yields of 411 and 412 were determined to be 0.20 and 0.12, respectively, which are considerably higher than those of the corresponding meso-alkylated SubPs (ca. 0.07).
Naturally, tris-β-benzene-fused SubPs 387 and 388 show red-shifted absorption and fluorescence spectra. Observed roughly similar spectra of these two SubPs suggested that the influence of the meso-phenyl substituents in 388 was only marginal, probably because of the restricted rotation of the meso-phenyl groups due to the steric congestion between the fused rings and meso-phenyl groups (Fig. 112).
The absorption spectrum of β-hexaethynyl substituted SubP 458 shows considerably red-shifted Soret bands (51 nm red shift with respect to 390). The effect is even stronger for β-hexaphenylethynylated SubP 454 (70 nm red shift). These examples indicate effective π-conjugation of the β-ethynyl substituents with the macrocyclic core.609 The corresponding fluorescence spectra show vibronic structure with similar fluorescence quantum yields to 390.
β-Substitution with heteroatoms such as Br and Cl in SubPs h, iodine in compound 477, and sulfur in 460–463, leads to effective fluorescence quenching as a consequence of the heavy-atom effect.609,611,617 Besides, the absorption spectra of hexaarylsulfanyl SubPs 460 and 461 are significantly perturbed, featuring red-shifted and split Soret-like bands at 376, 415 nm and 388, 423 nm, respectively, in addition to red-shifted Q-like bands at 507, 536 nm and 501, 528 nm, respectively. The absorption spectra of 462 and 463 show non-split red-shifted Soret-like bands and red-shifted Q-like bands.611
SubP 475 (Scheme 43) bearing one nitro group at one of the β-positions shows a split Soret-like band at 341 and 395 nm and a red-shifted, broad Q-type band at 513 nm. The emission band is solvent-polarity dependent, appearing in CH2Cl2 significantly red-shifted at 656 nm, with low quantum yield of 0.08.612 β-Aminosubporphyrin 476 also displays a broad Soret-like band at 366 nm and a slightly red-shifted, Q-type band at 474 nm, following similar tendencies as meso-substitution. β-Arylamino-SubPs 469–472 show red shifted absorptions as well, although the spectra are considerably different from those of meso-arylamino-SubPs.612 The fluorescence quantum yields of 469 and 470 in CH2Cl2 are lower (ϕF = 0.12 and 0.05, respectively) than that of SubP 523, while the corresponding Stokes shifts are 2410 and 3200 cm−1, respectively, being much larger than that of 523 (1380 cm−1), suggesting charge-transfer character for emitting species. meso-Substituted SubPs 471 and 472 are almost non-fluorescent in CH2Cl2, thereby plausibly indicating reductive and oxidative intramolecular electron-transfer quenching in their S1 states.
For SubPcs and SubPzs, the axial fluorine substituents do not alter the optical spectra significantly.159 Similarly, SubP 570 displays very similar UV-vis, MCD and fluorescence spectra to the hydroxo- and methoxo-derivatives.637 The Soret-like and Q-like bands of hydride SubP 597 are observed at 387 and 512 nm, with the fluorescence profile peaking at 560 nm with an absolute fluorescence quantum yield of 0.13.641 The absorption and fluorescence spectra of peroxo-substituted SubPs 602–604 are also quite similar to those of 390.642
The effects of the axial carbon ligands on the absorption spectra of SubPs are very weak. Thus, compounds with B–C bonds 574–583 show Soret-like bands in the 382–385 nm range and Q-like bands in the 501–508 nm range. B-bands of 584 and 585, on the other hand, appear comparatively blue and red shifted, respectively, at 379 and 389 nm.638

Fig. 113 shows the absorption and fluorescence spectra of 390, 570, 574, 597, 585 and 584.

Both the Soret- and Q-like bands are red-shifted in the order 570 < 390 < 584 < 574 < 597 < 585, reflecting the increasing electron-donating abilities of the axial substituents. The emission bands red-shifted exactly in the same order in good agreement with the respective Hammett inductive constants of the axial substituents. The corresponding fluorescence quantum yields are variable. Many of B–C SubPs exhibit fluorescence quantum yields (ϕF = 0.10–0.16) similar to that of 390, while strong fluorescence quenching is observed for donors in SubPs 577 and 579 that bear a strong donating axial group and in SubP 585 that bears an alkyl group.638


6.3.4 Photoexcited state dynamics. 
The photoexcited state dynamics of nitrophenyl-SubPs 440–443, with different rotational freedom because of the lack of methyl group (440), or different positions for the methyl group, namely, 3- (441), 3,5- (442) and 2-position (443), were compared to those of SubP 390. 443 has a severe rotational barrier of the nitrophenyl group, while the barrier for 441 and 442 are different.605 Transient absorption measurements showed different times for CS and CR in these SubPs, indicating that weak charge recombination-associated emission is only allowed for SubPs with freely rotating aryl groups. In particular, 390 displayed very rapid formation and decay of the CS state, showing broad absorbance in the range of 500–630 nm consisting of contributions from the [SubP+˙] and the nitrobenzene anion radical, with a CS rate of (3.7 ps)−1 and a CR rate of (330 ps)−1. The corresponding spectra of 441 and 442 also displayed quantitative CS and CR, with kCS = (3.0 ps)−1 and kCR = (530 ps)−1 for 441, and kCS = (2 ps)−1 and kCR = (210 ps)−1 for 442. The fluorescence lifetimes of 390, 441 and 442 (340, 510, and 200 ps, respectively) matched with the lifetimes for CR processes, indicating that their red-shifted fluorescence in CH2Cl2 is originating from the CS state. The TA spectra of 443, with an orthogonal conformation, indicated the rise and decay of a broad absorbance in the 480–660 nm range, arising from the CS state, with kCS = (5.0 ps)−1 and kCR = (40 ps)−1. The lack of red-shifted fluorescence can be explained by the very fast CR, producing a short-lived CS state.
Photoinduced electron transfer processes have also been studied on meso-arylethynyl SubPs 513, 515, 516 and 516H+.574
After photoexcitation into the Franck–Condon state, amino-subporphyrin 516 followed an adiabatic pathway to the CS state, with a time constant of 0.4 ps, whereas the CS state underwent CR, with a time constant of ca. 700 ps. In contrast, the TA of the nitro-SubP 515 in acetonitrile showed that the CS took place with a time constant of 2.8 ps, while CR occurred with a time constant of 20 ps. The latter is consistent with the negligible CS state emission in 515. The energy levels of the charge separated states for 513, 515 and 516 were estimated to be 2.35, 1.95 and 2.08 eV. Protonated SubP 516, on the other hand, recovered an increased fluorescence quantum yield, indicating the absence of CS state upon irradiation.
The excited state dynamics of meso-arylamino-SubPs 523, 524 and 525 were also studied, revealing these SubPs as good platforms of twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT). Thus, photoexcitation of 523 leads to the population of the locally excited state (LE) that has a slow transient absorption decay and high fluorescence quantum yield. In contrast, photoexcitation of 524 produces rise and decay profiles with time constants of 3.5 and 44 ps, respectively. The time constant of 3.5 ps indicates that the formation time of the CS state involves the structural twisting motion at the Cmeso–N bond, to trigger the intramolecular charge transfer, giving subporphyrin anion radical and 1,4-diaminobenzene cation radical.
Similarly, photoexcitation of 525 produces decay and rise times of excited state absorption signals of 9 ps. The population of LE is transferred to the CS state, undergoing twisting of the N–Cipso bond to trigger the opposite charge separated state, to give a subporphyrin cation radical and a nitrobenzene anion radical.645
The effect of bulky groups in the TICT processes have been studied using diarylamino-SubPs 536, 538 and 539.646 Due to rotation restriction, the electronic structures of these SubPs are more perturbed than those of 523–525. As a result, the TICT process is less efficient in 539 than in 525. As a proof of the TICT mechanism, the fused diarylamino SubP 562 (R = NMe2), with completely restricted rotation of the diarylamino moiety, exhibits fluorescence, contrasting with the fluorescence quenching observed for 524 and 538 due to TICT.623


6.3.5 Redox properties. 
Owing to their superb spin-delocalization abilities over almost the entire molecule, SubPs are able to stabilize radical species. Thus, oxidation of meso-hydroxy-,647 amino630 or dicyanomethyl-SubPs629 with PbO2 provides the corresponding meso-oxy (607), meso-aminyl (608) and meso-dicyanomethyl (609) radicals (Fig. 114).
 Fig. 114  Subporphyrin-based stable radicals. 
With respect to their electrochemical features, meso-unsubstituted BzSubP 387 is by 0.75 V easier to oxidize than the corresponding SubPc.189 On the other hand, β-hexaethyl SubP 412 is 0.21 V easier to oxidize that the parallel β-hexapropyl SubPz 276.63 Both comparisons illustrate the more electron-deficient nature of the meso-triaza-Subporphyrinoids with respect to meso-carbon macrocycles. Electrochemical studies the other meso-unsubstituted SubPs 415, 430 and 358 have not been reported.
Comparing BzSubPs and SubPs, meso-triphenylSubP 390 is by 0.51 V more difficult to oxidize and 0.40 V easier to reduce than the corresponding benzoannulated compound 388. For meso-arylated SubPs such as 390, 395–398, 407 and 409, the first one-electron oxidations are reversible waves in the range of 0.64–1.02 V versus the ferrocene/ferrocenium ion couple, while the second oxidation steps are irreversible. A plot of the first oxidation potentials of these SubPs versus the Hammett σ values constitutes a straight line. Compounds 390, 395–398, 407 and 409 show their first reduction potential in the −1.30 to −1.83 range. Besides, except for the nitro-derivative 397, a plot of the first reduction potentials versus the Hammett σ values also constitutes a straight line, suggesting that the first reductions of these SubPs take place at the SubP π-system (LUMO orbital).2
Both oxidation and reduction couples shift depending on the donating or withdrawing nature of the substituents, as well as the position, i.e. meso-, β- and axial, at which they are attached. Alkylation at the meso-positions has a little impact (0.01 V cathodic shift) on the oxidation potential of SubP 491 (Table 26), while the reduction wave is cathodically shifted by 0.34 V with respect to the triphenylated 390, denoting the electron richer character of meso-alkyl SubPs, related to the meso-phenyl compounds.586 Alkylation at the β-positions produces a stronger effect. In fact, neither 411 or 412 show any reduction process up to −2.0 V.594 In addition, 411 shows a quasi-reversible first oxidation potential at 0.59 V and a second irreversible one at 1.24 V, whereas 412 shows the first reversible oxidation potential at 0.62 V and the second irreversible at 1.19 V. Anyway, the strongest effect is observed upon alkylation at the axial position in 585, which shows its first oxidation and reduction processes at 0.52 and −2.14 V, respectively.

As a general trend, axial coordination with carbon-based electron-donating groups produces the highest effects in the redox properties of SubPs, related to the meso- (compare, for example, 576 with 392 and 579 with 405 in Table 26) or β-substitution (compare, for example, 457 with 574 and 455 with 338 in Table 26). In this respect, SubPs 574–585 show more negative oxidation (−0.17 to 0.68 V) and reduction potentials (−1.93 to −2.14 V) than 390, with both processes shifted by the same extent. The latter results in similar electrochemical HOMO–LUMO gaps for 574–585, lying in the of 2.57–2.66 eV range. Exceptions are aminophenyl- (577) and ferrocene (579) substituted SubPs, with electrochemical HOMO–LUMO gaps of 2.36 and 1.84 eV, respectively. For the latter compounds the first oxidation processes appear at 0.32 and −0.17 V, corresponding to the oxidation of the 4-dimethylaminophenyl and ferrocene moieties, respectively. The equivalent oxidation of meso-triferrocene-SubP 405 has been observed as a split wave at −0.028 and 0.14 V, a fact that has been interpreted as a diagnostic of effective electronic communication among the appended ferrocene units.592 The HOMO–LUMO gap of 405 is also considerably reduced to 2.05 eV, and the same occurs for other SubPs substituted with electron-donating groups as seen in thiophene-substituted SubP 401 (2.16 eV).586
The redox couples of compounds endowed with electron withdrawing groups such as 394–397 (Table 26) appear at more positive potentials. SubPs 396 and 397, containing conjugated electron-withdrawing substituents at the para-positions, exhibit different multireduction processes. In particular, 4-cyanophenyl-substituted SubP 396 displays three single-electron reduction waves at −1.53, −1.73, and −1.90 V, whereas and 4-nitrophenyl-substituted SubP 397 shows a three-electron reduction wave at −1.30 V. For 397, the deviation from linearity of the plot of the first reduction potential versus the nitro Hammett σ parameter suggests that the first reduction process might occur at the 4-nitrophenyl groups.2
Comparison of the effects of electron-withdrawing groups at the meso-, β- and axial positions suggests a different trend with respect to the above discussed effect of electron-donating groups. Thus, compared to 390, meso-4-cyanophenyl- (396) and meso-4-bromophenyl- (393) substituents shift the first oxidation potentials anodically by 0.24 and 0.06 V, respectively, while reduction processes are also anodically shifted by 0.29 and 0.12 V, correspondingly.2 However, the same substitution patterns produce weaker effects when they are at the axial site. Thus, for example, the oxidation potentials of the axial cyanophenyl-SubP 588 and bromophenyl-SubP 590 appear 0.14 and 0.08 V anodically shifted, respectively, compared to the axial phenyl-SubP 574, whereas the reduction processes are 0.07 V more difficult for 588 and 0.05 V easier for 590.639 Other electron-withdrawing substituents such as aldehyde, carboxylic acid (SubP 548 and SubP 549 in Table 22)631 and ester (Table 26)603 or trifluoromethyl (Table 26) shift the redox potentials towards more positive values. For example, 4-trifluoromethyl-moieties anodically shift both oxidation and reduction processes around 0.35 V when they are attached at the meso-phenyl rings (compare compounds 570 and 572 in Table 26) and around 1.00 V when they are directly attached to the β-positions (compare SubPs 572 and 466 in Table 26). Likewise, the two-meso-esters of 437 anodically shift to 1.00 V the first oxidation potential and to −1.6 V the first reduction wave.603
SubPs 389 and 390, bearing axial hydroxo- and methoxo-substituents, respectively show similar values for the first oxidation and reduction potentials.3 The replacement of the oxo-substituent by fluorine in 570 leads both the oxidation (+0.13 V) and reduction waves (+0.04 V) to more positive potentials.641 Axial hydride (SubP 597) dramatically shifts the oxidation peak to 0.36 V, while axial peroxides produce weaker influence. In particular, the first one-electron reductions of 602, 603 and 604 are quasi-irreversible, suggesting that the one-electron reduction induces O–O bond cleavage. Besides, the first reduction potentials are positively shifted in the order 603 (−1.94 V) < 602 (−1.81 V) < 604 (−1.70 V), reflecting the electron-donating abilities of the peroxy substituents.642
The effect of heteroatoms at the pyrrole β-positions of SubPs varies according to the electronic nature of the substituents. HexabromoSubPs (h) present anodic potential shift of both oxidation and reduction waves (Table 26) indicating that inductive effects of bromine are dominant for modulating the electrochemical potentials.609 β-Sulfanyl-SubPs 460–462 (Table 26) show one irreversible oxidation process at 0.65, 0.77, and 0.67 V, respectively, roughly similar to 390. More different, the corresponding oxidation wave of SubP 463 appears at 0.55 V.611 The cathodic window, however, shows one reversible reduction wave for each compound at −1.63, −1.58, −1.79, and −1.79 V, respectively, significantly more positive than that of 390. Monofunctionalized β-sulfanylSubP 467 (Fig. 101) shows redox features more similar to those of 390, namely at 0.79 and −1.95 V, corresponding to the oxidation and reduction waves, respectively.611
A single nitro- or amino-substituent attached at the β-position produces much stronger impact in SubPs 475 and 476 (Scheme 43), respectively or in arylamino-SubPs 469–472 (Fig. 101).612 For example, the first one-electron oxidation and reduction potentials of SubPs 475 and 476 appear at 0.82 and −1.39 V and 0.28 and −2.08 V, that is, more positive (ΔE = +19 and +60 V) and more negative (ΔE = −35 and −0.09 V), respectively, than those of the corresponding SubP 409 (Table 26 and Fig. 115).612 The electrochemical HOMO–LUMO gaps for 475 (2.21 eV), arylamines 469–472 (2.10–2.46 eV) and 476 (2.36 eV) are calculated to be smaller than that of compound 409 (2.62 eV).

The corresponding potentials of the meso-substituted nitro-SubP 555 and amino-SubP 557 (Scheme 48) are much more influenced. For 555, the redox features appear still more positively shifted appearing at 1.23 (oxidation, ΔE = +0.52 V) and −1.20 V (reduction, ΔE = +0.77 V), while for 557, they are negatively shifted to 0.11 V (oxidation, ΔE = −0.60) and −2.19 V (reduction, ΔE = −0.22 V).632 The effect of the amino group is comparable to that produced by another aliphatic amines such as 526 (Table 26). Together with axially substituted hydride- (597) and aminophenyl-SubPs (577), as well as meso-tris-ferrocene-SubP (405) and tris-thienyl-SubP 401, SubPs bearing amino groups directly attached to the meso positions (523–526) are among the easiest to electrochemically oxidize, with oxidation potentials ranging from −0.18 V for the p-dimethylaminoanilino-substituted compound 524 to 0.42 V for the p-nitroanilino-derivative 525.
The electrochemical potentials of SubP radical species 607–609 appear in the 0.20–0.47 V range for oxidation waves and −0.29 to −0.40 V range for reduction processes. On the basis of these values, the corresponding excitation energy gaps to the S1 state has been estimated to be in the 0.75–0.85 eV range.629,630,647


6.3.6 Theoretical calculations. 
DFT studies on the electronic structures and IR spectra of SubPs were reported with the exchange–correlation (XC) functional of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBEPBE) coupled to the DGDZVP basis set.648 Besides, the electronic structure, absorption spectra, and 1H and 13C-NMR spectra of the hydroxyboron(III) SubP complex, as well as the free-base SubP, had been performed at the B3LYP/6-311G(2d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) theory level.521 Both reports have been previously reviewed by some of us.1
Trends in the electronic structures and optical properties of ring contracted porphyrins have been analyzed by comparing the properties of SubPs with those of triphyrins and vacataporphyrins, using cyclic polyene perimeter-model approaches, such as Gouterman's four-orbital model and Michl's perimeter model.649
More recently, exploration of the ground and excited states to determine absorption and emission properties of SubPs and BzSubPs, including the 0–0 energies and the vibronic couplings, has been carried out using PCM-TD-DFT calculations. Comparison of the aromaticity of SubPs with that of other porphyrinoids, as well as the impact of meso-substitution on the SubP core, has been rationalized.215 The NICS values computed at the centers of the rings have been estimated to be of −20.6 for SubP and −19.1 for BzSubP, in line with those calculated for the corresponding triaza-analogues (−20.7 for SubPzs and −18.7 for SubPcs). With respect to the optical properties, the Q-bands have been predicted to involve changes in the electronic density upon photon absorption, to be mainly localized in the center of the macrocycles, with the pyrrolic nitrogens and the meso-atoms gaining electronic density, while the α-carbon atoms lose it (Fig. 116). The Soret band involves more delocalized excited states. For the benzo-analogues BzSubP and SubPc, the analysis of the vibrational modes signals two families of modes playing a key role: the first one at 500–750 cm−1, accounting for shoulder at ca. 15 nm from the 0–0 band, and the second one at 1400–1500 cm−1 being responsible for the presence of a secondary maximum in BzSubP, or the enlargement of the band in SubPc (Fig. 116).

6.4 Synthesis and properties of subporphyrin oligomers and complex systems

6.4.1 Subporphyrin oligomers connected at the meso positions. 
SubP dimers connected with biphenylene,583 bithiophene621 and butadiyne585 bridges, as well as complex dendritic carbazole-functionalized,590,591 or capped588 SubPs, had been previously reported and reviewed by some of us.1
More recently, a meso-to-meso directly linked SubP dimer 610 (Fig. 117) has been assembled in 72% yield by reductive coupling of bromo-SubP 508 in the presence of [Ni(cod)2] and 1,5-cyclooctadiene.604 Bis-SubP 610 shows slow rotation through the meso–meso bridge, with ΔH‡, ΔS‡ and ΔG‡298 values of the rotation barrier of 14.7 kcal mol−1, 1.28 cal mol−1 K−1, and 14.3 kcal mol−1, respectively. The SubP units show a mean bowl depth of 1.33 Å, and B–B distance of 7.21 Å, with a dihedral angle of 55.58° between the two subporphyrin cores. In accordance, the absorption spectrum of 610 shows a Soret-like band at 403 nm with a broad shoulder around 388 nm, and broadened Q-like bands with two peaks at 462 and 516 nm and a tail extending over 550 nm. Besides, 610 shows emission at 593 nm with a large Stokes shift (2520 cm−1). These optical features suggest conjugative interactions of the two SubP units due to the small rotational barrier of the meso–meso bond, in addition to excitonic interaction between the chromophores.
 Fig. 117  Structures of meso–meso-linked SubPs. 
SubP dimers connected with trans-ethylene (611) and acetylene (612) linkers (Fig. 117) have been prepared by Stille and Sonogashira coupling reactions, respectively, using bromo-SubP like 508 as the precursor. Specifically, treatment of 508 with trans-1,2-bis(tributylstannyl)ethene afforded 611 in 36% yield. Dimer 612 was prepared in 61% overall yield by using a three-step procedure consisting of Sonogashira reaction of 508 with ethynyltrimethylsilane, followed by deprotection and Sonogashira coupling of the triple bond with 508.650 The crystal structures of 611 and 612 show anti arrangements of the macrocycles favorable for electronic communication, with a slightly tilted (26.6°) ethylene linker, whereas the acetylene bridge is almost coplanar to the SubP rings. Indeed, both dimers show significantly red shifted and intensified Q-bands at 660 and 630 nm, respectively, with a tail reaching around 700–750 nm. The fluorescence bands are also bathochromically shifted and enhanced, indicating large structural changes in the S1-state, as a result of the effective conjugation between the two chromophores.

meso-Lithium SubP, obtained by bromine-lithium exchange of bromo-SubP derivatives such as 508, has been employed to synthesize SubP dimers 613, 614, and 615 (Fig. 117), by reaction with 1,2-dichlorotetramethylsilane, dimethyl carbonate, and formyl-SubP 548, respectively.631 The dihedral angles between the carbonyl group and the two SubP rings are small (33.7 and 23.6°, respectively) for the ketone 614, suitable for extended conjugation over the entire molecule. In fact, the corresponding absorption spectrum was found to be largely redshifted, owing to the effective electronic communication of the two SubP units through the carbonyl linker. On the other hand, the Si–Si bond takes a nearly perpendicular orientation in dimer 613 (87.9° with respect to the SubP core), favorable for σ–π conjugation, which contributes to slightly red-shifted Q-bands.
Other meso-to-meso linked SubP dimers have been connected through azo- (616), amino- (617), sulfide- (618) and disulfide- (619) bridges (Fig. 117). Oxidation of amino-SubP 557 with PbO2 afforded the meso-to-meso azo-SubP dimer 616 in 83% yield, presumably intermediated by the corresponding aminyl radical of 608 type.632 Dimer 616 shows fairly coplanar stacking arrangement favorable for electronic conjugative interaction. This results in largely perturbed and red-shifted absorption spectra, with split Soret (339, 423 nm) and Q-bands (654, 704 nm), accompanied by quenched fluorescence.
Bis-SubP amine 617 has been obtained in 46% yield by SNAr reaction of chloro-SubP 509 with amino-SubP 557.630 Due to its electron rich nature, dimer 617 is unstable under aerobic conditions, and tends to generate the corresponding aminyl radical as a fairly stable species.
S-bridged dimer 618 has been assembled in 43% yield by treating chloro-SubP 509 with 0.55 equiv. of Na2S·9H2O in the presence of catalytic amount of n-Bu4NBr. When 1.5 equiv. of Na2S·9H2O were employed for this reaction, the S–S-linked dimer 619 was obtained in 35% yield, presumably arising from aerobic oxidation of the corresponding monomeric SubP-thiol during the workup.651 The average bowl depth for SubP units in dimer 618 is of 1.38 Å, with a dihedral angle between the two macrocycles of 86.7°. This orthogonal arrangement precludes electronic interaction between the two chromophores, giving rise to red shifted fluorescence, as well as split Soret band, together with broad Q-bands; the optical features have been rationalized in terms of exciton coupling between the two SubP entities. A large Stokes shift of 2670 cm−1 is indicative of substantial structural changes in the excited state. The SubP components of disulfide 619 experience less electronic perturbation than the sulfide counterpart and quenched fluorescence, owing to the very short lifetime of its S1 excited state.


6.4.2 Subporphyrin dimers connected at the β-positions. 

syn- and anti-β-to-β 1,3-butadiyne-bridged SubP dimers 620 (Scheme 54) were prepared in around 30% yields by deprotection reaction of 2,13-bis-(tert-butyldimethylsilylethynyl)-SubP 485, followed by oxidative dimerization by treatment with Cu(OAc)2.617 Both syn- and anti-isomers show in their crystal structures non-equivalent CC units and distortions of the triple bonds, with no substantial differences in their butadiyne C–C bond lengths. The average SubP bowl depths are of 1.46 Å for the syn- and of 1.50 Å for the anti-isomers, with B–B distances of 11.92 and 11.97 Å, respectively. Both syn- and anti-dimers exhibit split Soret bands at 409 and 453 nm and 406 and 441 nm, respectively, accompanied by bathochromically shifted Q-bands at 557, 583, and 554 nm, correspondingly, as diagnostic of large electronic coupling between the two macrocycles. The differences in the absorption profiles of the two isomers have been explained in terms of exciton coupling using dipole–dipole approximation developed by Kasha.652
 Scheme 54  Synthesis of β-to-β 1,3-butadiyne-bridged SubP dimers 620. 
Directly β-to-β-connected dimer 623 was synthesized by reductive coupling of β-iodo SubP 622, which was in turn prepared by controlled borylation of SubP 621 and subsequent iodination (Scheme 55).619 In order to accomplish the peripheral borylation, the axial group must be changed to a nonpolar tolyl. Dimer 623 was obtained as an inseparable 1:1 mixture of DL and meso-diastereomers, from which preferential crystallization of the DL-diastereomer was achieved. In the solid state, DL to meso isomerization was not observed. However, pure DL-diastereomer was isomerized in methanol at 50 °C, giving a diastereomeric 2:1 mixture of DL- and meso-623, thus suggesting the occurrence of SubP bowl inversion. Because of the lesser steric congestion around the β-positions, the average Cβ–Cβ bond length in DL-623 is of 1.44 Å, and the dihedral angle between the two macrocycles is of 29.3°, much smaller than that observed for the meso-to-meso dimer 610. DL-623 shows a red-shifted Soret band that is rationalized in terms of exciton coupling between the two SubPs, in addition to sharp Q-bands at 464 and 509 nm. Observed smaller Stokes shift (1160 cm−1) related to that of other SubP dimers indicates less structural relaxation of DL-623 in the excited state.

6.4.3 Subporphyrin systems connected through the axial positions. 
Some SubP arrays connected at the axial position20,36 and μ-oxodimers637 have been reviewed by some of us.1 As explained above, the peroxo-bridged subporphyrin dimer 605 has been prepared by heating hydroxo-peroxide 602.641

meso-Axially attached SubP trimer 625 has been obtained serendipitously by SNAr reaction of chloro-SubP 509 with potassium hydroxide.647 The formation of the triangular trimer has been rationalized by considering a spontaneous self-assembly of the SubP alcohol 624 (Scheme 56).
 Scheme 56  Synthesis of meso-to-axial cyclic SubP trimer 625. 
In 625, the SubP bowl depths are of 1.267, 1.354 and 1.356 Å. Its UV-vis spectrum displays a split Soret band, suggestive of strong through-space exciton coupling between the neighboring SubP units, enabled by the short interchromophoric separation distance of 7 Å. The trimer was monomerized to the corresponding meso-hydroxy-SubP 624 upon treatment with methanol.
More recently, a related meso-axially attached SubP dimer 626 has been assembled by Shimizu and co-workers in 9% yield, through an ether cleavage reaction of the A2B-type subporphyrin bearing an ortho-anisyl substituent 431 (Scheme 57). Despite the spatial proximity between the two subporphyrin chromophores in 626, the dimer exhibited similar UV-vis absorption, MCD and fluorescence spectra than the corresponding monomer, indicating minor interchromophore interactions in 626.653
 Scheme 57  Synthesis of meso-to-axial cyclic SubP dimer 626. 


6.4.4 Fused subporphyrin dimers. 

meso-to-meso′ and β-to-β′-doubly linked SubP dimer 627 (Fig. 118) was prepared as a single anti-isomer by selective dibromination of DL-623 at the two free-meso-positions followed by coupling in the presence of [Ni(cod)2].619 The average bowl-depth for the SubPs is of 1.42 Å in 627, and the dihedral angles between the two macrocycles are of 22.9° at the meso-position and 17.3° at the β-position, that is, smaller than that of DL-623 and favorable for extended π-conjugation. In fact, the elongation of the conjugation produces an absorption spectrum for 627 displaying broad and red-shifted B and Q-bands at 444 and 641 nm, respectively, the latter with a tail reaching around 850 nm (Fig. 119), and almost completely quenched fluorescence.654

Doubly Pt-bridged SubP dimer 628 was synthesized in 64% yield as a sole syn-isomer by treating β,β′-diboryl-SubP j (Scheme 44) with Pt(cod)Cl2 in the presence of CsF and COD. 628 was oxidized with magic blue to give 629, which was subsequently refluxed in toluene, in the presence of 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane, affording triply linked SubP dimer 630 as a result of reductive elimination.655 The crystal structure of dimer 628 revealed a square planar Pt ion coordinated in a cis-manner and holding a face-to-face SubP arrangement. The triply fused dimer 630 takes a domed structure with a positive Gaussian curvature. The calculated bowl-depth of the SubP halves is of 1.65 Å, much larger than that of SubP monomers, and indicating that the triple linkage forces additional structural strain. 630 displays absorption bands at 315, 403, 500, 810, and 942 nm (Fig. 119). A narrow optical HOMO–LUMO gap clearly suggests the effective conjugation extending over the whole molecule. The absorption bands at 315, 403, and 500 nm have been assigned as split Soret-like bands. The absorption spectrum of 629 is clearly different from that of 627, but similar to that of 630, suggesting substantial interaction through the Pt-linkage.

syn- and anti-β,β-Dithiino-SubP dimers 631 were prepared through a seven-step synthetic procedure and separated by chromatography at the end. The sequence started from arylsulfanyl-Sub 467 (Fig. 101), and had a key step consisting in the SNAr reaction between a SubP β,β′-thiol and a SubP β-Br,β-sulfone.656 Dimers 631 are conformationally very flexible, as indicated by analysis of different crystals. Hence, while the crystals of the anti-isomer showed a completely planar configuration, distinct crystals of the syn-isomer showed various conformations, going from a bent-towards-the-convex-sides structure to an almost planar conformation. The UV-vis spectra exhibit similar features for both isomers, characterized by split Soret bands arising from exciton coupling between the two SubP macrocycles, accompanying a Q-band around 490 nm. Both syn- and anti-631 formed 1:1 cocrystallates upon treatment with C60 and C70. In addition, the syn-isomer was able to capture both fullerenes in toluene, with high association constants that exceed 106 M−1.


6.4.5 Subporphyrin-based hybrid systems. 
The preparation of some SubP hybrids containing bodipy,623 1,4-quinone,589 ferrocene592 and porphyrin657 have been previously reviewed by some of us.1 For the latter, fast excitation energy transfer processes from the SubP to the porphyrin units have been reported to occur. These photoinduced events are enabled by the π-conjugative elongation of the SubP onto the phenylene linkers, as if SubP and ZnP were directly attached.658

meso- and axially appended SubP-based electron donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugates, have been assembled using 1,1,4,4-tetracyanobuta-1,3-diene (TCBD)–aniline (SubPs 632 and 633) and naphthalenediimide (SubPs 634) as the strong electron-acceptor counterparts. SubPs 632 and 633 were prepared by CA–RE reactions of meso-alkynyl-SubP 516 and axial alkynyl 584-like SubP, respectively, with TCNE.45 The crystal structures show highly nonplanar conformations for the TCBC units, leading to two enantiomers that are obtained as racemates in 632 and 633. The two R and S enantiomers of 633 were separated by chiral HPLC, while the corresponding meso-isomers 632 displayed structural flexibility that precluded the corresponding enantiomeric separation. The electronic interaction between the SubP and the TCBD–aniline unit is also influenced by the position to which the acceptor unit is attached. In particular, the attachment at the axial position in 633 produces less perturbation, since a large HOMO–LUMO gap of 2.12 eV disables any emissive CT state, and enforces an emissive exciplex deactivation in apolar environments next to the SubP-centered fluorescence; in polar environments, a CS state is generated.
Contrasting, the meso-substituted SubP 632 showed strong electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor units, owing to the very reduced HOMO–LUMO gap of 1.77 eV, enabling an emissive CT state in virtually all environments, although it is only in polar environments, where it links a local excitation with an indirect CS.
Five dyads, namely, 634, 6342Me, 6343Me, 6342,6Me, 6343,6Me (see Fig. 120) were synthesized by Suzuki–Miyaura coupling with bromo-SubP 508 with the corresponding NDI-Bpin derivatives.659 The absorption and emission spectra of all the dyads were very similar to the sum of their components, with the SubP chromophore dominating the spectra because of its much larger molar absorptivity with respect to the NDI unit. Measurements on the fluorescence decays for the five dyads show that there is a systematic variation of the singlet excited state lifetime with the substitution pattern ranging from 5–15 ps, which corresponds to near quantitative CS. TA measurements revealed that both CS and CR times vary systematically with steric bulk, reflecting that the electronic coupling between the SubP and the NDI becomes smaller as the dihedral angles between the two subunits are increased.

6.5 Applications of subporphyrin and subporphyrin hybrids
Compared to SubPcs, studies on the applications of SubPs to different technological fields still remain in their infancy. Axial functionalization of BzSubP 387 with a 5-mercaptopentyloxy unit to give 635 (Fig. 121) allowed to anchor the dye to the Au(111) surface via reaction with 1-heptanethiol linkers that were preorganized as a self-assembled monolayer (C7S SAM) on the Au(111) substrate, so that the SubP was electronically decoupled from the metal surface. STM differential conductance (dI/dV − V) measurements with the bare W tip exhibited a broad gap region of low conductance and three distinct responses at 2.4, −1.3, and −2.1 V.636
 Fig. 121  Structures of BzSubP 635 and SubPs 636–640. 
SubP-saponite organoclays based on quaternized SubPs 391 and 393 have been studied in terms of their luminescence properties.624 In addition, a photochemical reaction system, using a metalloporphyrin as a photocatalyst and quaternized SubP 393 as a photoantenna, has been constructed on a clay nanosheet as an artificial photosynthetic model. Efficient energy transfer from the SubP to the metalloporphyrin of up to 98% was achieved. Such dye–clay complexes have proven to photocatalyze the conversion of cyclohexene using a wide range of visible region without any energy loss.577
In another example, a dye-sensitised photoanode for visible light-driven water oxidation to O2 has been constructed using the push–pull SubP 636 (Fig. 121). The dye has been integrated as the photosensitizer in a photoelectrochemical cell with a TiO2 electrode, together with [RuII(bda)(pic)2] (bda = 2,2′-bipyridine-6,6′-dicarboxylic acid, pic = 4-picoline), which works as the water oxidation catalyst.578 Structurally referable push–pull SubPs 637–640 were investigated as photosensitizers in DSSCs achieving power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 6.0–10.1.576
6.6 Subporphyrin analogues

6.6.1 Borenium cations. 
Borenium cations (SubP)B+ (Fig. 122) are always detected in positive ion mass spectrometry of boron SubPs and constitute feasible intermediates in axial ligand exchange reactions under acidic conditions.640 Their spectroscopic properties have been reviewed by some of us.1 The SubP borenium cations were isolated by Osuka and co-workers as stable carborane salts (see for example 641 in Fig. 122) in 58–91% yield by treating the corresponding SubP derivatives with Et3Si[CH6B11Br6].640 The crystal structure of the borenium cations is almost planar (bowl-depth of 0.114 Å) with B–N bond lengths significantly shorter than for the neutral species, reflecting the positive charge and the hybridization change of the central boron from sp3 to sp2.

6.6.2 Modifications on the subporphyrin pyrrole rings. 
A3-type subchlorins 642–644 (Scheme 58) have been prepared by Osuka and co-workers by reduction of the “quasi-isolated” pyrrolic double bond of the parallel SubPs 390, 399, 407 with p-tosylhydrazide (method A) (Table 27).587 The use of Ni–Ra, affords the corresponding subbacteriochlorins 649–652 (Fig. 122), which are obtained with comparable yields of 21–47%.660 Panda and co-workers have prepared A3 (648) and A2B-subchlorins (645–647) in 6–11% yields directly from the complexation of the tripyrrane f wherein R1 constitute ester groups, followed by reaction with triethyl orthoformate603,661 or acyl chloride derivatives661 under standard conditions for SubP synthesis (Scheme 58 method B) (Table 27).

Subbacteriochlorins can be oxidized with Ag2O to the corresponding Subchlorins, with higher overall yields than those obtained in the one step procedure with the hydrazide.660 In turn, Subchlorins can also be oxidized to the corresponding SubPs using DDQ.
As SubPs, Subchlorins and Subbacteriochlorins exhibit a 14π-electron aromatic circuit and conical geometry, with bowl-depths of 1.26 Å, although the degree of aromaticity of the three compounds is different, as inferred from their NMR data. Accordingly, the nuclear independent chemical shift (NICS) values calculated at B3LYP/6-311G(d) level are of −10.9 ppm for 649 < −14.9 ppm for 642 < −18.9 ppm for 390.659 The different aromatic characters of the three compounds are also reflected by their optical properties, with decrease and blue shift of the Soret bands in 642 and 649, related to that of 390, while the fluorescence quantum yields follow the order 642 < 390 < 649 (Fig. 123). Comparatively, the oxidation potentials of Subbacteriochlorins are lower than those of the corresponding Subchlorins, and these are in turn lower than those of the parallel SubP. For example, the potential values for the first oxidation peaks are of 0.00 V for 649, 0.42 V for 642 and 0.78 V for 390.587,660

Pyrrole cleaving modifications have been performed in SubPs giving rise to Subporphyrin analogues with different structural, chemical and electronic properties. Thus, the Subseco-chlorins 656 and 657 have been prepared through controlled monobromination of 574, followed by substitution to give the alcohol 654, which was oxidized to dioxoSubchlorin 655. The latter was transformed into the Subseco-chlorin 656, and subsequently decarboxylated to 657.614 Most importantly, the dioxo- and Subseco-chlorins have been used in a variety of chemical transformations to give different core modified SubP analogues,614 such as subporpholactone 664, subporpholactama 665, imidazoloSubP 666,662 dithiazoloSubchlorin 667, dithiazinoSubchlorin 668, oxodithiazinoSubchlorin 669, dioxodithiazinoSubchlorin 670,663 and quinoxalino-fused SubPs 671–674,664 as described in Scheme 59 and Table 28.

6.6.3 Subpyriporphyrins and [3]cyclo-1,8-carbazolylene. 
Subpyridoporphyrin 675 represents another type of core-modified SubPs that contains a pyridine ring replacing one of the pyrrole moieties.1,665 Reported by Latos-Grażyński before SubPs, it was prepared in 6% yield through monobenzoylation, reduction and intramolecular condensation reactions, starting from a pyrido tripyrrane k (Scheme 60). As a distinctive structural feature, Subpyridoporphyrin is obtained as a free base triphyrin, which can react with PhBCl2 to yield the metal complex 676 where the macrocycle acts as monoanionic tridentate ligand. The coordination leads to aromatization of the macrocycle because of structural changes allowing delocalization of 14π electrons. The electronic spectrum of 675 displays two bands at 346 and 730 nm, respectively, that are parallel to the B and Q-porphyrin absorption bands.666 The changes induced upon metalation are not great, apart from a slight bathochromic shift of the broad Q-band with respect to the free base.

[3]Cyclo-1,8-carbazolylenes 677 and 678 constitute even more exotic tripyrrole-based porphyrinoids that have been prepared in 11–16% yields by Higashibayashi and co-workers. The synthetic procedure involves Ni(COD)2-mediated cyclo-oligomerization of 1,8-dibromocarbazole (Scheme 61).667 X-ray analysis revealed a distorted, flake-shaped C2 structure with three chiral axes that possesses axial chirality, the relative configuration of which is expressed as (S*,R*,R*). Free base 678 represents a trivalent tridentate ligand that hosts boron, phosphorus, and silicon atoms (Scheme 61, compounds 679–681). The introduction of the different heteroatoms has been achieved by treatment with BBr3, PCl3 or PhSiCl3, respectively, in the presence of a base. In addition, the phosphorus atom of 681 has been oxidized with m-CPBA, leading to the phosphine oxide 682.

X-ray diffraction analysis of the complexes 679, 681 and 682, as well as DFT calculations on 680, revealed a location for the central heteroatoms above the curved surface. The absorption profile of 677–682 is dominated by a strong band (ε = 30000–40000 M−1 cm−1) at 301–317 nm, accompanied by weaker bands (ε = 5000–17000 M−1 cm−1) at 356–415 nm, while their emission bands appear at 421–440 nm, with fluorescence quantum yields ranging from 0.06 (681) to 0.34 (680).


6.6.4 [14]Triphyrins(2.1.1). 

meso-Aryl-substituted [14]triphyrin(2.1.1) and [14]benzotriphyrin(2.1.1) derivatives reported by Shen, Yamada and Kobayashi, represent SubP analogues containing one additional meso-carbon in its structure. The insertion of the second sp2-hybridized carbon atom between one of the three neighboring pairs of pyrroles produces nearly planar, metal-free, contracted porphyrinoids, containing 14 π-electron aromatic circuits.668 Synthetic aspects and spectroscopic properties of [14]triphyrins(2.1.1) have been previously reviewed by some of us,1 and others.5,649,669,670
The synthesis of [14]triphyrins(2.1.1) can be performed in one step with 10–40% yields, by condensation reaction between a pyrrole n (Scheme 62, method A) and an aryl aldehyde in the presence of high concentration (1.2 equivalents) of BF3·OEt2.668 An azafulvene or an azafulvenium cation have been proposed as feasible intermediates of the cyclization reaction to assemble the triphyrin(2.1.1) ring.671 When 3,4-diethylpyrrole is used as the starting material, the corresponding hexaethyl-substituted [14]triphyrin(2.1.1) 683 is obtained (Table 29).672 4,7-Dihydro-4,7-ethano-2H-isoindole (BCOD-pyrrole) provides macrocycle 684 (Table 29), which has been quantitatively transformed into the corresponding [14]tribenzotriphyrin(2.1.1) 685 by retro Diels–Alder reaction. Triphyrins 686–689 (Table 29) were prepared by a similar Rothemund–Diels–Alder sequence, as well as the analogous [14]trinaphthotriphyrin(2.1.1) 691. Compounds 685, 686, and 688 have been used as efficient catalysts for direct C–H arylation of benzene with aryl halides,673 while 687 catalyses the two-electron reduction of O2 by Me8Fc, to produce H2O2.674

Three stepwise procedures have been reported for the synthesis of [14]tribenzotriphyrins(2.1.1). Method B (Scheme 62) consists in the McMurry coupling of the diformyltripyrrane intermediate o, followed by oxidation. The latter has been used to prepare the unsubstituted triphyrin at the meso-positions 692 (Table 29).675 Moreover, the reaction of dipyrroethane-derivative p with an aromatic aldehyde in the presence of TFA (method C, Scheme 62) allowed to prepare the [14]triphyrin(2.1.1) 693 (Table 29) bearing different substitution at the meso-positions.676 The mechanism for method C should involve partial cleavage of the dipyrrole intermediate p or an intermediate evolved from it, and formation of a free pyrrole.676 A most recent [2+1] procedure that allowed to prepare meso-arylated [14]triphyrins(2.1.1) 694–700 in 15–18% yields (method D) consists in the reduction of acylated dipyrroethene intermediates q (Scheme 62) with NaBH4, leading to the corresponding dipyrroethene-dicarbinol, which is in situ condensed with pyrrole in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid, followed by oxidation with DDQ in open air.677,678 Owing to the availability of the precursors n and q, Methods A and D have general applicability to the synthesis of various symmetric and non-symmetric [14]triphyrins(2.1.1), respectively, while the scope of methods B and C is very much restricted to compounds 691 and 692 so far.
There are very scarce examples on the pyrrole or meso-fabrication of triphyrins. Two ethynyl-ferrocene substituents have been introduced at the two-meso-methylene bridges by Sonogashira coupling reaction.678 Likewise, one of the β-pyrrole positions of the tilted pyrrole ring (see crystal structure below) has been selectively monobrominated, and subsequently subjected to Sonogashira coupling with ethynyl-ferrocene.678
The crystal structure of triphyrin 696 reveals the presence of one 1H-pyrrole and two 2H-pyrrole rings, the former attached to the meso-carbon of the ethene bridge and with strong hydrogen-bonding interactions with the two 2H-pyrrole nitrogen atoms. As a consequence, the triphyrin core shows an almost planar arrangement, except for the 2H-pyrrole ring opposite to the ethene bridge, which is slightly tilted (16.6°) from the mean plane defined by the four meso-carbons.677 Two of the meso-phenyl substituents display a dihedral angle of ∼77° each, with respect to the plane of the triphyrin, whereas the corresponding dihedral angles of the other two are of 46.7° and 36.9°, respectively. The strong triple hydrogen bonding presumably compensates the macrocycle's diamagnetic ring current effect, therefore, the resonances of the [14]triphyrin(2.1.1) inner NH protons lie at remarkably low field despite their calculated NICS(0) values ranging from −9.15 to −15.6 ppm.668,672,677 Similar structures have been reported for triphyrins 692 and 693.675,676 The crystal structure of the benzo-fused triphyrin 685 also shows 16.3° tilting for the corresponding isoindole ring situated opposite to the ethene bridge. But conversely to the pyrrole series, a rapid exchange between the two NH tautomers is suggested in the solid state.668
The optical spectra of the [14]triphyrin (2.1.1) free bases are dominated by an intense band between 350 and 450 nm and weaker bands in the 500–650 nm region (Fig. 124), which have been assigned to allowed and forbidden B and Q bands, respectively, by analogy with Gouterman's four-orbital model for tetrapyrrole porphyrinoids. Thus, for example, tetraphenyl-substituted triphyrin 696 exhibits a B-band at 380 (ε = 5012) nm, in addition to three Q-absorptions at 478 (631), 528 (794) and 564 (794) nm.677 Fusing benzene and naphthalene rings to the [14]triphyrin(2.1.1) skeleton produces red shifts both of the B and Q bands, with concomitant increase of the latter (Fig. 124a), as a diagnostic for extended conjugation.672,679 Similar effects are observed in the MCD spectra of the same compounds (Fig. 124b).672

KGaA, Weinheim. 
Some [14]triphyrins(2.1.1) are weakly fluorescent, showing an emission band around 560 nm (695–698), or 580 nm (700).676–678 The tribenzo- and trinaphtho-series display their emission bands bathochromically shifted at 596 and 628 nm, respectively, with very low quantum yields of 0.01 and 0.04, respectively. Time-resolved fluorescence and fluorescence anisotropy measurements point to a considerable influence of the overall planarity, which is enhanced by the peripheral fused moieties, as the main the factor affecting the excited-state lifetimes,679 excluding any role of internal proton transfer (IPT) in the relaxation of the excited states.680 In fact, molecular distortion, which is produced by meso-substituents and reduced by the inner hydrogen bond, plays a major role in suppressing the non-radiative relaxation.681
The [14]triphyrin (2.1.1) free bases are electrochemically easier to reduce and more difficult to oxidize than the corresponding SubPs. Thus, for comparison, tetrabenzo-triphyrin 696 shows two reversible reductions at −0.84 and −1.25 V (1.13 V more positive than SubP 390) and one irreversible oxidation at 1.32 V (0.61 V anodically shifted with respect to SubP (390).677 As described below, the difference in the redox potentials of the two types of subporphyrinoids triphyrin and SubP arises from the additional meso carbon, rather than from the lack of central boron atom.
[14]Triphyrin(2.1.1) can function as a cyclic, monoanionic, tridentate ligand,669 and coordinate metal ions such as rhenium(I),672,675,677,682 manganese(I),675,683 ruthenium(II),672 or platinum(IV),684 leading to octahedral complexes (Fig. 126b), while rhodium(III) produces square pyramidal conformations,685 and B(III) provides tetrahedral structures (Fig. 125 and Table 30).686 In addition, η5-cyclopentadienyliron(II) and η1,η3-C8H12 iridium(III) triphyrin sandwich complexes, in which Fe(II) and Ir(III) are inserted between Cp and COD ligands, respectively, and one triphyrin macrocycle, have been reported.687,688 With the exception of the Pt(IV) complexes, which are obtained upon oxidation of the corresponding Pt(II) complexes, all of the other triphyrin complexes can be prepared by heating a free base with the appropriate metal salt. The resulting complexes are bowl-shaped, with the metal ions lying above the plane containing the three inner nitrogens. The bowl-depth for the rhenium(I) complexes has been reported to range from 2.2–2.5 Å, about 1 Å larger than those of boron(III) SubPs (see Tables 24 and 30). Similar curvature has been observed for Mn(I) complexes, although the reported bowl-depth values are about 0.2–0.3 Å shorter than those reported for the Re(I) complexes, and in the same order as that observed for the Rh(III), Ir(III) and Pt(IV) complexes bases (Fig. 126).684,685,688 On the other hand, Fe(II) complexes show a less pronounced curvature (∼1.8 Å),687 and B(III) complexes result to be much flatter, with bowl depths of 0.93–1.03 Å, even shorter than that of the parallel SubP 574 (Tables 24 and 30).686

[14]Triphyrin (2.1.1) can also function as a neutral bidentate ligand with Pt(II)684 and Pd(II) ions,689 leading to structures like 723–725 (Fig. 125 and Table 30) with deep, saddle conformation and Cs symmetry bases (Fig. 126a). The coordination mode for these complexes is square-planar, with cis-conformation for the Pt(II) and Pd(II) ions. Here, the non-coordinated pyrrole rings tilt downward from the mean plane defined by the four meso-carbon atoms, while the two coordinated pyrrole rings are tilted upward (Fig. 126a).
In general, the optical spectra of triphyrin complexes are very similar, with absorption bands in the Q-region that are more extended to the red and infrared regions than those of the corresponding free bases (Fig. 126). The intense bands in the 450–550 nm region of the spectra of the metal complexes and the weaker envelopes of absorbance intensity to the red of the Q bands (450–800 nm) have been assigned to metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) bands on the basis of TD-DFT calculations.672,675,677,687,688 The absorption properties of the boron complexes 718 and 719 are exceptionally more similar to that of the free bases than those of the other metal derivatives.686 Besides, the insertion of the boron atom in 718 and 719 does not bring the corresponding redox potentials near to those of SubPs. On the contrary, the oxidation and reduction features of the boron complexes appear relatively similar to those of the parallel free bases 692 and 696, at −1.38 and −0.83 V for 718 and −1.16, −0.78 and +1.27 V for 719,686 pointing to a little effect of the central boron atom in the electrochemical differences between SubPs and [14]triphyrin (2.1.1). Other central ions such as rhenium(I), produce further anodic shifts on the corresponding oxidation and reduction peaks (for example, −1.12, −0.65 and +1.35 V for 706).677


6.6.5 Other triphyrins. 
Triphyrin analogues comprise a variety of macrocycles in which one or more pyrrole units of the triphyrin structure have been replaced by carbocycles, like in carbatriphyrins(3.1.1),690 carbatriphyrins(2.1.1) (726Fig. 126),691 azulitriphyrins(1.2.1) (727),692,693 or other types of carbatriphyrins,694 including the triphyrin(2.1.1)-tetraphyrin(1.1.1.1) hybrid 737.695 Substitution of one pyrrole ring by other heterocycles also produces triphyrin analogues. Many of these works have been performed in the laboratories of H. Yamada, M. Pawlicki or Latos-Grażyński. For example, replacement by a thiophene ring leads to thiatriphyrins(2.1.1) (728 and 729).696,697 The oxatriphyrin appellative refers to an assortment of structures containing a furan unit, of which [14]oxatriphyrin(2.1.1) (730) constitutes the simpler representative.698 Other oxatriphyrins contain additional rings, like an ortho-phenylene motif (731),699 or a fused benzene ring,697 or a thiophene ring (732, 733),700,701 benzofuran (735) or benzothiophene rings (734),702 as well as dibenzofuran or dibenzothiophene rings.703 An additional furan moiety (736) leads to oxatriphyrin(3.1.1) (Fig. 127).704,705
 Fig. 127  Some examples of triphyrin analogues containing carbocycle or heterocycle subunits. 
Other modifications consist in the insertion of meso-bridges of different nature between the three triphyrin pyrrole rings. For example, the so-called vacataphyrins 738 (Fig. 128) consist of a [18]triphyrin(6.1.1) structure,706 while triphyrin 739 consists of a [15]triphyrin(1.1.3) derivative.707 [22]Triphyrin(6.6.0) (740) and [22]Triphyrin(6.5.0) (741) represent examples of what has been called expanded porphyrin contraction.708,709 In 742 one of the meso-units consists of an aminoethoxy moiety,710 while [18]triphyrins(4.1.1) containing ethyne (743 and 744)711–713 or butadiene714 bridges have been reported. All of these structures contain completely different macrocyclic cores and hence, new and diverse coordination chemistry.669

7. Conclusions
Since the serendipitous synthesis of the first subporphyrinoid in 1972, the chemistry of tripyrrole and triisoindole porphyrin analogues has expanded considerably. This review, which comprehensively covers the last decade of discoveries, documents the exponential growth in the number of publications related to subporphyrinoids and highlights the scientific interest in this class of compounds for many application areas ranging from optoelectronics to biomedicine.
On one hand, big steps forward have been made during the last years in the fundamentals of subporphyrinoids chemistry. The development and optimization of novel methodologies for the synthesis and post-functionalization of these contracted macrocycles keep drawing attention, leading to the possibility of finely tuning the optoelectronic properties of these derivatives. Importantly, tremendous progress has been made in understanding the supramolecular organization of these cone-shaped cores. On the other hand, the application of subporphyrinoids is gaining more and more attention from the scientific community due to the outstanding physicochemical characteristics that these macrocycles offer. The field of subporphyrinoid-base systems for solar energy conversion has blossomed during the last decade, paving the way for the effective implementation of these derivatives in photovoltaics. Moreover, significant advances have been made in the exploitation of this contracted porphyrinoids for therapy and imaging in bio-focused application.
Nevertheless, this upward trend is still at an early stage, and many challenging issues at both the fundamental and application levels remain unexplored. The preparation and exploitation of chiral subporphyrinoids constitutes one of the hottest topics in the frame of the optoelectronic applications of these derivatives. Although initial studies on the application of SubPcs in solar energy conversion schemes have shown the great potential of this class of compound, future efforts are needed to optimize the architecture and the performances of SubPc-containing photovoltaic devices. On the other hand, more comprehensive studies are needed in the frame of the biological applications of SubPcs. Certainly, the development of subporphyrinoid-based applications requires further efforts and fundamental progresses in the chemistry of these macrocycles.
We hope that this review, in which the most recent advances in subporphyrinoids are presented and discussed, will inspire and boost further research in this area, contributing to unveil the fundamentals of this fascinating class of compounds, and leading to innovative developments in their known implementations in optoelectronics and biomedicine as well as in yet unexplored applications.
