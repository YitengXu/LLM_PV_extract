    , Accepted 19th February 2016First published on 22nd February 2016AbstractA series of randomly arranged donor–acceptor-type copolymers, used as replacements for fullerene-based acceptors in organic solar cells, were synthesized by the Stille coupling copolymerization. The copolymers, PNDI–TT–TVTs, were composed of naphthalene tetracarboxylic diimide (NDI) acceptor units and randomly distributed thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) and thienylene-vinylene-thienylene (TVT) donor units. The effects of the TT-to-TVT ratios on the absorption, energy levels, charge transport, morphology, and performance of the resulting fabricated solar cell devices were investigated. The polymer solar cells fabricated from blends of poly[[4,8-bis[5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7-Th) and PNDI–TT–TVTs (containing 25% of TT and 75% of TVT) displayed a power conversion efficiency of 5.27%, which was significantly higher than those achieved by devices based on alternating arranged copolymers. The current results indicate that random copolymerization is a promising approach to develop novel polymer acceptors for application in organic photovoltaics.
Introduction
Conjugated polymer-based solar cells1–4 have gained increasing attention as a possible inexpensive source of renewable energy because of their advantages including high throughput and large-area production with low-cost printing processes.5 The most studied polymer-based solar cells have a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) active layer comprising an electron donor (D) polymer mixed with an acceptor (A) of a low-molecular weight fullerene derivative. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of polymer/fullerene BHJ solar cells has steadily increased over the past decade.6–9 However, fullerene acceptors, employed in polymer solar cells (PSCs), have several disadvantages: (1) relatively weak absorption ability in the visible region owing to their symmetrical structures; (2) high-purity chemical requirements, thereby making their synthesis costly; (3) thermally unstable polymer/fullerene blend film morphology owing to the rapid diffusion of fullerene molecules; and (4) restricted chemical and energy tunability, consequently limiting the design of complementary polymer donors for maximum PSC performance, particularly in simultaneously enhancing the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current (JSC).10–13
Recently, all-PSCs, which are composed of binary blends of conjugated polymer donor/polymer acceptor, have attracted significant interest owing to their potential advantages over conventional polymer/fullerene solar cells: (1) readily tunable molecular energy levels; (2) simultaneous absorption of the polymer donor and polymer acceptor; and (3) enhanced mechanical/thermal properties.14–16 Although significant progress has been made in the area of all-PSCs, the PCEs of such devices are considerably lower (≤8%)17,18 than those of polymer/fullerene-based devices (10.8%).19 To date, the most interesting n-type conjugated polymers employed in all-PSCs constitute strong electron-withdrawing naphthalene tetracarboxylic diimide (NDI) units on the backbone for their high electron affinities and high electron mobilities.20,21 Nevertheless, the performance of all-PSCs containing NDI-based n-type polymers remains considerably lower than that of typical fullerene-based solar cells.18 The low PCEs of all-PSCs are attributed to many undesirable features of the BHJ films e.g., mismatched energy levels of the donors and acceptors, large phase-separated domain size, inhomogeneous compositions in each phase, and a low degree of ordering of polymer chains, all of which hamper the generation and transportation of free charge carriers in the films, thus resulting in a low device performance.22–24
To achieve high all-PSC performances, both molecule and device engineering approaches have been explored. Specifically, developing new materials that may address the above-listed issues is a current research focus.25,26 Synthesizing n-type polymers with new building blocks is an attractive approach.27 Another strategy is to construct randomly conjugated copolymers based on multiple existing building blocks that can afford the fabrication of a wide range of new materials with controlled physical and/or chemical properties. High-performance random copolymer donors based on this approach have been developed for application in solar cells, as reported therein.28–32 However, very few acceptors with such a structure have been reported.33,34 It is expected that the band gaps, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, charge transport properties, and photovoltaic behaviors of random copolymer acceptors can be fine-tuned by adjusting the component ratio of the building blocks by simply varying the monomer feed ratio during synthesis.
In this paper, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) and/or thienylene-vinylene-thienylene (TVT) were used as electron-rich moieties and NDI was used as the electron-deficient unit to construct copolymer acceptors for application in PSCs (Fig. 1). Alternating copolymers comprising copolymers 1 and 5 were prepared for comparison. Both TT and TVT donor units were used in the alternating donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers. Such a structure afforded better coplanarity of the polymer backbone, thereby reducing the packing distance among the polymer chains, promoting the long-range ordering of the molecules, and increasing the charge carrier mobility in the films.35,36 Different PNDI–TT–TVT copolymers designed and synthesized are shown in Scheme 1. Additionally, the structure–property relationship of the random D–A copolymers was systematically studied. The effects of the TT-to-TVT ratios on the absorption, energy levels, charge transport, morphology, and performance of the prepared PSCs were investigated.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
Five copolymers were synthesized via the Stille coupling reaction involving 4,9-dibromo-2,7-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-benzo[lmn][3,8]-phenanthroline-1,3,6,8(2H,7H)-tetraone (compound a), 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thieno-[3,2-b]-thiophene (compound b), and (E)-1,2-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)-ethene (compound c) in one pot (Scheme 1). The obtained polymers were precipitated in methanol and then purified by Soxhlet extraction to remove the oligomers and other impurities. Branched long alkyl chains (2-octyldodecyl) were introduced into the conjugated backbone to ensure the solubility of the copolymers in organic solvents. Specifically, all copolymers showed excellent solubility in chloroform and chlorobenzene at room temperature. The molecular structures of the copolymers were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) (Table 1). The weight-average molecular weight (Mw), number-average molecular weight (Mn), and polydispersity index (PDI; Mw/Mn) of the polymers were measured using GPC against polystyrene standards in o-dichlorobenzene at 120 °C. The Mn of the copolymers varied slightly in the range of 26.7–36.5 kDa with PDIs of 1.58–1.63 (Table 1).

Thermal properties
To evaluate the thermal properties of the copolymers, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis of all the prepared copolymers were performed. All copolymers displayed good thermal stability with a weight loss of 5% was observed in a temperature range of 427–441 °C under nitrogen flow (Fig. 2a). The DSC curves of the prepared copolymers are shown in Fig. 2b. Specifically, copolymer 5 displayed a very sharp endothermic peak upon heating at 267 °C and an exothermic peak upon cooling at 256 °C; the peaks were attributed to the melting and crystallization transitions of the polymer.37 Observation of the sharp/distinct endothermic and exothermic peaks in the DCS trace of copolymer 5 suggested that copolymer 5 had better crystallinity. In contrast, copolymers 1 and 2 did not feature any distinct endothermic or exothermic peaks. Copolymers 3 and 4, which respectively contained 50% and 75% of TVT in the copolymer backbone, displayed a broad endothermic band upon heating and a broad exothermic band upon cooling. The significant differences among the DSC traces of the five copolymers suggest that TT and TVT units are randomly distributed within the PNDI–TT–TVT backbone that does not contain any long copolymer 5 polymeric blocks.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-visible absorption spectra of the copolymers in dilute chloroform and as thin films (prepared on glass with a thickness of 95–110 nm) are shown in Fig. 3. In solution, all copolymers exhibited typical NDI-based D–A polymer absorption features, with two distinct bands at 300–450 and 500–800 nm that were respectively ascribed to π–π* transitions and intramolecular charge transfer bands.38 The absorption features of the random copolymers were observed between those of the two alternating copolymers 1 and 5. Red shifts were detected in solutions and films with increasing TVT feed ratios in the main chain. The absorption spectra of the polymers recorded as thin films were red-shifted compared with those recorded in solution. This result suggested the onset of aggregation of the polymer chains in the solid state. The optical band gaps of the copolymers (1.65–1.46 eV) were estimated using the absorption edges of the thin films (Table 1). The optical band gaps of the random copolymers were between those of the two alternating copolymers, thus suggesting that fine-tuning of the band gap of the random copolymer could be achieved by adjusting the TT-to-TVT ratio.

The electrochemical properties of the copolymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry in acetonitrile containing 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6 at a potential scan rate of 100 mV s−1 (Fig. S1†). The copolymers were prepared as films coated on a glassy carbon working electrode. The LUMOs were estimated from the onset of the reduction waves, using the Ag/AgCl redox couple as the reference. As the TT-to-TVT ratio in the main chain decreased from 1 to 0, the LUMO energy level increased from −3.94 to −3.88 eV. The HOMO levels (5.59–5.34 eV) of the copolymers were calculated using the corresponding copolymer optical band gaps and the LUMOs. Fig. 1 schematically illustrates the energy-level diagram of the polymer acceptors. As observed, the HOMO and LUMO levels of the random copolymers lay between the two alternating copolymers, thereby showing that the energy levels of the random copolymers were fine-tuned by adjusting the TT-to-TVT ratio. The HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymer acceptors matched well with those of the donor polymer PTB7-Th and the interfacial material 2,9-bis(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)anthra[2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′]diisoquinoline-1,3,8,10(2H,9H)-tetraone (PDIN), resulting in energetic offset and driving forces sufficient for charge transfer.39
Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic behaviors of the copolymer acceptors were characterized using PTB7-Th as the donor material. The devices were fabricated as per the conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:acceptor/PDIN/Al. The devices were tested under an AM 1.5 G simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2. Component PEDOT:PSS was used as the hole-injection layer and PDIN was used as the cathode interlayer.40 The current density–voltage (I–V) curves of the PSCs fabricated with different PTB7-Th to polymer acceptor weight ratios are shown in Fig. S2–S6 (ESI†). The associated performance data of the PSCs are presented in Tables S1–S5 (ESI†). As deduced from the results, the optimal donor-to-acceptor weight ratios ranged from 2:1 to 3:1. o-Dichlorobenzene was used as the processing solvent because it afforded the best-quality blend films. The I–V curves of the PSCs fabricated with the optimized D-to-A ratios are shown in Fig. 4a. The VOC, ISC, fill factor (FF), and PCEs of the optimized devices are presented in Table 2. Furthermore, the corresponding dependency of the photovoltaic parameters, i.e., ISC and PCE, on the TVT feed ratio is shown in Fig. 5. The optimized device prepared with blend PTB7-Th:copolymer 1 (2:1 wt%) displayed a PCE of 0.79%, with a VOC of 0.570 V, ISC of 3.56 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.391. Under the same testing conditions, the optimized device using copolymer 5 as the acceptor exhibited an improved PCE of 2.94%, with a ISC of 7.41 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.795 V, and FF of 0.499. As observed in Table 2 and Fig. 4a, when the TVT ratio in the copolymer backbone increased from 0 to 25%, the all-PSC prepared with blend PTB7-Th:copolymer 2 (2:1 wt%) displayed a considerably improved PCE of 3.48% at a ISC of 9.60 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.805 V, and FF of 0.451. Further increases in the TVT feed ratio to 50% resulted in further increase in the PCE of the device based on copolymer 3 (2:1 wt%) to 3.65% at a ISC of 10.86 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.779 V, and FF of 0.431. The all-PSCs containing copolymer 3 were further optimized by adjusting the PTB7-Th:copolymer 3 weight ratio to 3:1. This led to device PCE of up to 4.86% (ISC = 12.66 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.790 V and FF = 0.486). Among the five studied devices, the device based on copolymer 4 (2:1 wt%) exhibited the best PCE of 5.27%, with ISC of 13.75 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.794 V, and FF of 0.483. The significant improvement was attributed to the increased ISC. As observed in Fig. 5a, when the TVT feed ratio increased from 0 to 25% in the copolymer backbone, ISC increased from 3.36 to 9.60 mA cm−2. A further improvement in ISC (to 12.60 mA cm−2) was achieved when the TVT feed ratio increased to 50% in the copolymer backbone. The device based on copolymer 4, containing 75% TVT in the copolymer backbone, exhibited the highest ISC (13.75 mA cm−2) among all devices studied. However, further increases in the TVT ratio to 100% (copolymer 5) led to a reduced ISC (7.41 mA cm−2).

Furthermore, the devices fabricated with the random copolymer PNDI–TT–TVT exhibited higher external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) within the wavelength range of 300–800 nm than those using the two alternating copolymers. This result was consistent with the higher ISC values observed for the random copolymer PNDI–TT–TVT-based devices. The EQE spectra in the high-energy region (300–500 nm) clearly indicated that photo excitation occurred within the acceptor and contributed to the power conversion results. Notably, these devices were fabricated using a simple spin-coating process and optimized by tuning the donor-to-acceptor ratio. Further improvements in device performance are expected through formulation (i.e., solvents and additives) and process (i.e., thermal annealing and/or solvent annealing) optimization. The current findings demonstrate that the development of random conjugated copolymers is a promising method to synthesize highly efficient active materials for organic solar cell applications.
Hole and electron mobilities
Space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement was performed to investigate the bulk charge transport in the blend films to better understand the photovoltaic properties of the materials. Hole-only devices with a configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend/MoOx/Al and electron-only devices with a configuration ITO/ZnO/blend/Ca/Al were fabricated and characterized. The charge carrier mobilities obtained from the SCLC fittings of the I–V characteristics of the hole-only devices (Fig. S7a†) and electron-only devices (Fig. S7b†) are summarized in Table 3. Blend PTB7-Th:copolymer 1 (2:1 wt%) displayed a hole mobility (μh) and an electron mobility (μe) of 1.56 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.89 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (μh/μe = 0.54). The hole and electron mobilities of PTB7-Th:copolymer 5 (2:1 wt%) blend film were 3.23 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.23 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh/μe = 0.76), respectively. The all-PSC prepared with a film blend of PTB7-Th:copolymer 2 (2:1 wt%) exhibited a better balanced charge transport (μh = 3.52 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 3.18 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1; μh/μe = 1.11) when compared with the devices based on copolymers 1 and 5. The device based on blend PTB7-Th:copolymer 3 (3:1 wt%) demonstrated high charge mobilities and balanced charge transport properties (μh = 4.34 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 4.26 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1; μh/μe = 1.02). The device based on blend PTB7-Th:copolymer 4 (2:1 wt%) exhibited the highest charge mobilities (μh = 4.62 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, μe = 5.58 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1; μh/μe = 0.83). The improvement in the charge transport properties of the random copolymer-based devices may be the key factor that accounts for the higher ISC values.

Film morphology
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the surface morphology of the active layers of the devices. The AFM topographic images (2 μm × 2 μm) of the different blend films are shown in Fig. 6. No significant differences were observed among the films containing different polymeric acceptors. The root mean square (RMS) roughness values obtained from topographic scans of the PTB7-Th:copolymer 1 (2:1 wt%) and PTB7-Th:copolymer 5 (2:1 wt%) blend films were respectively 2.01 and 1.92 nm. In contrast, the AFM topographic images of the PTB7-Th:copolymer 2 (2:1 wt%), PTB7-Th:copolymer 3 (3:1 wt%), and PTB7-Th:copolymer 4 (2:1 wt%) blend films displayed RMS values of 1.84, 1.62, and 1.11 nm, respectively. The rougher features of the active layer may result in the formation of some shunt paths in the devices, causing charge accumulation/charge recombination at the interface between the active layer and the cathode. The occurrence of such a phenomenon would partially account for the low VOC of the device based on PTB7-Th:copolymer 1 and low ISC of the two devices based on PTB7-Th:copolymer 1 and PTB7-Th:copolymer 5.41,42 As observed in Fig. 5, the relatively low surface roughness coincided with the relatively high ISC of the devices, thereby generating superior PCEs and more balanced and higher hole and electron motilities in the films. The low surface roughness suggested enhanced mixing between the donor (PTB7-Th) and random copolymer that is beneficial to creating more favorable phase-separated domains with more efficient exciton dissociation and charge migration in the device. This result additionally helps to explain the significantly higher ISC and PCEs values observed for the random copolymer-based devices.43 However, it should be noted that the blend surface morphology does not represent the bulk morphology due to the possible blends of vertical phase segregation of the donor and acceptor polymers.44 More detailed investigation of the correlation between the blend surface and bulk morphologies with a bulk sensitive characterization is necessary in future.

Conclusions
We developed a series of random D–A type semiconducting copolymers PNDI–TT–TVTs, which contained NDI as the acceptor unit and randomly distributed TT and TVT as the donor units. The effects of the TT-to-TVT ratio on the absorption, energy levels, charge transport, morphology, and performance of the fabricated PSCs were investigated. Blend films with lower surface roughness were realized by tuning the TT-to-TVT ratio. The random copolymer-based devices exhibited higher and more balanced charge mobility, subsequently achieving significantly improved ISC and device performance when compared with devices using the corresponding alternating copolymers. The solar cells prepared with blend PTB7-Th:copolymer 4 showed a high PCE of 5.27%. The random copolymerization method reported herein is a simple and accessible approach to develop novel n-type materials using state-of-the-art building blocks with the desired chemical/physical properties for organic solar cell applications.

Synthesis procedures

Copolymer 1. 
Compound a (197.0 mg, 0.2 mmol) and compound b (93.2 mg, 0.2 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous toluene (5 mL), after which Pd(PPh3)4 (9.3 mg, 0.0080 mmol) was added (Scheme 1).

Instrumentation and characterization

1H NMR data were acquired on a Bruker DPX 400 MHz spectrometer. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were performed under nitrogen on a TA Instrument DSC Q100 using a scanning rate of 10 °C min−1. TGA was performed on a TGA Q500 using a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Molecular weight determinations were performed in hot dichlorobenzene solution on a Shimadzu Prominence CBM-20A series HPLC using an Agilent PLGel 5 micrometer Mixed-C column (79911 GP-MXC) and polystyrene calibration standards. Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed using an Autolab potentiostat (PGSTAT30) by Echochimie. A glassy carbon disk was used as the working electrode, a platinum wire was used as the counter electrode, and a silver wire was used as the reference electrode. Ferrocene was used for the potential calibration. UV-visible-near-infrared spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu 2501-PC. The nanoscale morphology of the blend films was observed using a Veeco Nanoscope V atomic force microscope in tapping mode.
Photovoltaic cell fabrication and performance evaluation
PSCs were fabricated with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-Th:PNDI–TT or PNDI–TT–TVT/PDIN/Al. Prior to use, the patterned ITO glass was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber (Jelight Company, Irvine, CA, USA) for 20 min. A thin layer (30 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios VP AI 4083, H. C. Starck, Leverkusen, Germany) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass and baked at 150 °C for 15 min. A solution (total of 20 mg mL−1) of PTB7-Th:copolymer was subsequently spin-coated (2000 rpm) on the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a photosensitive layer (∼100 nm thick). The thickness of the photosensitive layer was measured using an Ambios Technology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) XP-2 profilometer. A methanolic solution (0.2% acetic acid) of PDIN at a concentration of 1.5 mg mL−1 was deposited on the active layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s, giving a PDIN layer of ∼13 nm thick. An aluminum (thickness: ∼100 nm) layer was subsequently evaporated onto the surface of the PDIN layer under vacuum (∼10−6 Pa) to produce the negative electrode. The active area of the device was 0.1 cm−2. The I–V curves were measured with a computer-controlled Keithley (Cleveland, OH, USA) 236 Source Measure Unit. A xenon lamp coupled with AM 1.5 solar spectrum filters was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell. Incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded using a Stanford Research Systems (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) SR830 DSP lock-in amplifier coupled with a WDG3 monochromator and a 500 W xenon lamp. Hole-only and electron-only diodes were fabricated using the following configurations: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoOx/Al for holes and ITO/ZnO/blend/Ca/Al for electrons. The mobility was extracted by fitting the I–V curves using the Mott–Gurney relationship (space-charge-limited current).
