Fax: +82 31 436 8146;   Tel: +82 31 400 5223E-mail: tjp@hanyang.ac.krReceived 26th July 2013, Accepted 23rd August 2013First published on 23rd August 2013AbstractFabrication of three-dimensional (3D) TiO2 nanoscale architectures with spindle, tube and rod shapes, by a novel deformation assisted approach is demonstrated. Plausible growth mechanisms are predicted based on morphological investigations. Improved photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) is observed using the fabricated nanostructures under visible light irradiation.Nanostructured materials are capable of exhibiting shape and size-dependent properties.1 In order to exploit this, material scientists are motivated to fabricate materials with unique size and shapes. Titanium dioxide is an important oxide semiconductor, which is constantly being researched and developed for applications in solar cells, photocatalysis, energy storage, sensing and so on.2 The performance of devices based on TiO2 relies on the size and morphology of TiO2. As an outcome, the development of TiO2 with various sizes and shapes has gained growing research attention. For instance, the development of anatase TiO2 nanostructures with exposed facets,3–5 is found to enhance its photocatalytic performance. Similarly, the incorporation of one-dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanostructures with nanoparticles during the fabrication of a photoanode improves the power conversion efficiency of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC).6,7 Apart from the conventional 1D TiO2 structures such as wires, rods, tubes and belts, three-dimensional (3D) TiO2 dendritic architectures containing 1D assemblies have been developed with an improved surface area to volume ratio.8–11 Controlling the hydrolysis of titanium containing precursors is found to be the key for the design and development of various complex TiO2 nanostructures. Yet, the size of the resulting complex 3D dendritic TiO2 structure is usually in the microscale with constituent 1D nano-units being in the nanoscale. Therefore, the development of a nanoscale 3D dendritic TiO2 structure still remains a challenge. In this communication, we present a novel approach to fabricate a three-dimensionally arranged spindle shaped TiO2 nanoscale architecture by the physical deformation of Sn2+ doped TiO2 thorn-ball shaped nanostructures (referred hereafter as TBN), recently reported by us.12 Although individual spindle (rice-shaped) nanostructures,13–15 have been reported previously, their 3D arrangement with a nanoscale architecture is rarely reported. In addition, we also report the fabrication of tube and rod shaped 3D TiO2 nanoscale architectures by the chemical and physical deformation of TBN, respectively.TBN are typically prepared through a two step approach. Precipitates are obtained in the first step and they are further treated hydrothermally in the second step, to yield TBN. The elaborate experimental details are provided in the ESI.† The detailed growth mechanism for the formation of TBN can be found elsewhere.12 The fabrication of spindle shaped TiO2 nanorods (referred hereafter as STN) by the deformation of TBN and its growth in the form of a 3D structure is schematically presented in Scheme 1 and is discussed based on morphological characterizations. Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the fabrication of spindle, tube and rod shaped 3D TiO2 nanoscale architectures by the deformation of thorn-ball shaped TiO2 nanostructures (TBN). STN is fabricated by sintering pristine TBN samples in the open air at 500 °C for 1 h. The XRD pattern of STN, can be indexed to the pure tetragonal rutile phase of TiO2 (JCPDS card # 21-1276) with lattice constants a = 4.593 Å and c = 2.985 Å. The rutile phase is consistent with that of TBN (formed by the influence of HCl and Sn2+) whose XRD pattern is also included in Fig. 1a for comparison.16 The XRD peak width of STN is narrower in comparison to the broad peaks of TBN suggesting its improved crystallinity as an outcome of sintering.17 The TEM image in Fig. 1c confirms the smaller particle size of STN (~50 nm) in comparison to TBN (~300 nm; Fig. S1, ESI†). The average length and diameter of each spindle from Fig. 1c is estimated to be ~50 and 20 nm, respectively. The spindles are found to be oriented along the (110) direction, parallel to the c-axis and the d-spacing value between the (110) plane is found to be 3.25 Å (Fig. 1d). This result is consistent with the high intensity diffraction peak of the (110) plane from the XRD.13 It is well known that the thermal treatment of TiO2 can transform its phase and morphology.18,19 In order to elucidate the plausible growth mechanism of spindle shaped TiO2 3D nanoscale architectures, TBN was sintered at 300, 400 and 500 °C, and the morphological evolution was tracked using TEM. The morphology of pristine TBN and those of sintered TBNs is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) and Fig. 2, respectively. During the thermal treatment, the exposed part of TBN containing sharp nanorods with an average tip diameter of ~10 nm,12 are first prone to thermal agitation. This is owing to the fact that the excess surface area of nanostructured materials with highly curved surfaces exhibits rapid surface diffusion upon thermal sintering.20 Sintering at 200 °C is found to disrupt the ball structure of TBN and the nano-thorns are converted to nanorods with a size of ~7 × ~90 nm (see Fig. 2a and b). Upon thermal treatment at higher temperatures, the width of the nanorods are found to increase while their length decreases proportionally to minimize the surface energy. Nanorods with the size of ~10 (diameter) × ~60 nm (length) (see Fig. 2c and d) and ~20 × ~50 nm (see Fig. 2e and f) are formed when sintered at 300 and 400 °C, respectively. The non-uniformity in their shape and size could be attributed to thermodynamic instability. Dinh et al.,21 observed the formation of some spherical TiO2 nanoparticles at higher temperatures, where they ascribe it to the balance between the kinetic and thermodynamic growth regimes (reduction of the surface energy). Sintering at 500 °C provides an optimum thermal energy for the deformation of TBN into thermodynamically stable TiO2 nanospindles (STN), which are aggregated into a flower like shape as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1  (a) XRD patterns of spindle and thorn-ball shaped TiO2 nanostructures. (b, c) TEM images of spindle shaped 3D TiO2 nanoscale architectures (STN), the area marked in (b) is shown in (c). Inset in (b) is the corresponding SAED pattern and the oval pattern marked in (c) depicts the spindle shape. (d) HRTEM image obtained from the small rectangular area marked in (c), the lattice spacing value d = 3.25 Å, corresponds to the (110) plane.  Fig. 2  TEM images of the TBN samples under different magnifications, sintered at (a, b) 200 °C, (c, d) 300 °C and (e, f) 400 °C, respectively. The formation of a spindle like 3D nanoscale architecture (STN) is noted. On the other hand, chemically synthesized spindle shaped TiO2 nanorods are reported to be formed through a peanut shaped intermediate structure.13,22 The aggregation and alignment of nanospherical TiO2 condense into spindle shaped TiO2 nanorods, which could be a possibility in our case too.Furthermore, TBN was treated chemically under alkaline hydrothermal conditions,23 for the fabrication of 3D TiO2 nanotubes (referred hereafter as TNT). The details of the synthesis are provided in the ESI.† The growth mechanism for the formation of TiO2 nanotubes (TNT) can be found elsewhere.23 The treatment of TNT at 500 °C for 1 h produced skein shaped 3D TiO2 nanorods (referred hereafter to as TNR) (see Scheme 1). SEM images of TNT illustrate a 3D architecture (Fig. S2, ESI†) and its corresponding TEM images are shown in Fig. 3a and b. The average tip diameter of a single nanotube (inset of Fig. 3a) is estimated to be ~7 nm. The morphology of TNR (Fig. 3c) looks similar to that of TNT, but the nanotubes are transformed into nanorods while TNT was sintered at 500 °C. The transformation of TNT to TNR at high temperature is by the virtue of the enhanced thermal stability of the nanorods, which may involve an oriented attachment and Ostwald ripening process.24Fig. 3d shows nanorods and a nanotube (marked by a box) which is yet to be transformed into a nanorod. The lattice spacing value of TNR was estimated to be 3.25 Å, which represents the (110) plane of rutile TiO2. The XRD results of TNT and TNR indicate that the rutile phase of TBN remains unchanged even after its deformation to a nanotube or nanorod (Fig. S3, ESI†). Narrower XRD peaks of TNR compared to TNT suggest that the crystallinity was improved by sintering, which is supported by the SAED ring patterns in the inset of Fig. 3b and c, without and with bright spots for TNT and TNR, respectively. Optical properties of the prepared samples were studied using UV-vis diffused reflectance spectra (DRS) (Fig. S4a, ESI†) and Kubelka–Munk theory was used to calculate the energy band gap (Eg).12 The Kubelka–Munk function for reflectance, F(R) is given as F(R) = (1−R)2/2R, where reflectance R = Rsample/Rreference. Tauc plots are constructed using the Kubelka–Munk function for reflectance [F(R)·hν]1/2versus hν, from which Eg was estimated by extrapolating the linear portion of Tauc's equation onto the energy axis (Fig. S4b, ESI†). The Eg value for STN was estimated to be ~2.86 eV, while that of TNT and TNR were ~3.25 and 3.15 eV, respectively. The higher Eg values of TNT and TNR are attributed to the etch-out of Sn2+ in TBN by sodium hydroxide during its chemical deformation to TNT/TNR, which is confirmed by using EDS (see Fig. S5, ESI†). Sn2+ doping reduces the Eg of TiO2 due to an upward shift in its valance band.12 The narrow Eg of STN is attributed to the presence of Sn2+. Fig. 3  (a, b) TEM images of 3D TiO2 nanotubes (TNT) under two different magnifications. Inset in (a) shows the high magnification TEM image of a single nanotube obtained from the area marked in (a) and the inset in (b) shows the corresponding SAED pattern. (c) TEM image of 3D TiO2 nanorods (TNR) and (d) HRTEM image obtained from the area marked in (c). The presence of a nanotube is represented using a box. Inset in (c) is the corresponding SAED pattern. Chromium (Cr(VI)) is one of the most toxic inorganic pollutants, and it is also a carcinogen. Although the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) using TiO2 nanostructures has been widely studied,25 reports on the usage of 3D TiO2 nanostructures are very few.26 This reason prompted us to evaluate the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) using the fabricated 3D TiO2 nano-architectures. Since the Eg of STN lies in the visible light region, the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) using the prepared nanostructures was tested under both UV and visible light irradiations (refer to experimental details, ESI†). In general, Cr(VI) ions are attracted to the positively charged TiO2 surface,27 which is created by the acid assisted synthesis procedure and by the acidity (pH = 3) of the reaction slurry. The photogenerated electrons migrate towards the positively charged surface of TiO2, where they mingle with Cr(VI) ions and reduce them to Cr(III).28 The rate of Cr(VI) reduction with respect to irradiation time using the prepared catalysts and P25 TiO2 (Degussa) under UV and visible light is shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. Although TNT and TNR exhibit a large surface area (127.94 and 76.15 m2 g−1, respectively) in comparison to STN (54.4 m2 g−1, see Fig. S6, ESI†), their rates of photo-reduction of Cr(VI) under UV light irradiation are commensurable. This is because of the wide Eg of the rutile-phased TNT and TNR and their low percentage of photoactive (110) facets, estimated from the XRD analysis (see Fig. S7, ESI†).29 On the other hand under visible light, STN exhibits the highest Cr(VI) photo-reduction capability of ~83%, which is obviously due to its narrow bandgap and 3D architecture which has a high percentage of photoactive (110) facets (Fig. S7, ESI†). For a comparison, we studied the photo-reduction capability of P25 TiO2 under the same experimental conditions. Results (Fig. 4) indicate that the photoactivity of P25 is comparable to STN under UV light, yet its activity under visible light was found to be the lowest, owing to its high Eg and low surface area.12 Fig. 4  Plots showing the time dependent reduction of Cr(VI) ions in the presence of different photocatalysts under (a) UV light and (b) visible light irradiation. In conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated a novel route to fabricate 3D architectures of spindle, tube and rod shaped TiO2 nanostructures by the deformation of pristine thorn-ball shaped nanostructures. Spindle shaped TiO2 nanostructures exhibited improved capability in the photoreduction of Cr(VI) under visible light irradiation, owing to its narrow bandgap, photoactive (110) facets and large surface area. The 3D TiO2 nanoscale architectures could possibly find applications in photovoltaics, sensors and optoelectronics.This work was supported by the research fund of Hanyang University (HY-2011-N).Notes and referencesC.
