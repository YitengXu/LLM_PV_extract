, Accepted 19th July 2013First published on 19th July 2013AbstractTwo novel supramolecular polymers (PHBTRU and PFBTRU) containing ruthenium(II) metal ions and bis-terpyridyl ligands with cyclopentadithiophene–benzothiazole conjugated bridges, have been successfully synthesized for application in polymer solar cells by the supramolecular self-assembly process. Both polymers exhibit appropriate solubility in organic solvents and excellent thermal stability with decomposition temperatures over 400 °C. The UV-vis and cyclic voltammetry results show that the resulting polymers have good light-harvesting abilities, low bandgaps as well as low-lying HOMO levels. Compared to polymer PHBTRU, the fluorine atom effect significantly improves the above optical and electrochemical properties of PFBTRU. The photovoltaic devices based on PHBTRU and PFBTRU were fabricated and evaluated with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The PFBTRU device exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.66% with a Voc of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 7.12 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.51, which was obtained without any additives and/or posttreatment of the active films. The photovoltaic performance achieved in this work is the best result of the reported supramolecular polymers being used in conventional BHJ polymer solar cells.
Introduction
In the past decade, considerable attention has been paid to polymer solar cells (PSCs) due to their unique advantages of low cost, flexibility, easy fabrication, light-weight nature and solution processability for large-area devices.1–4 A typical structure of PSC is usually called a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) device, which contains an active layer fabricated by blending electron-donating polymer donors and electron-withdrawing fullerene derivatives.5 Because the fullerene derivatives exhibit weak absorption in the visible range, the electron-donating conjugated polymers make the main contribution in harvesting the photons in these devices.6 In earlier work, poly(2-methoxyl-5-((2′-ethylhexyl)oxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (MEH-PPV), poly(2-methoxyl-5-((3′,7′-dimethyloctyl)oxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (MDMO-PPV), as well as regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) were widely studied as donor materials in BHJ PSCs.7–9 However, the high-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and the mismatch between the absorption of the devices and the terrestrial solar spectrum limited their photovoltaic performance.10 Therefore, low bandgap (LBG) conjugated polymers were put forward to increase the overall efficiencies of polymer solar cells by incorporating electron-rich (D) and electron-deficient acceptor (A) segments into the polymer backbones.11–13 The bandgaps can be readily tuned by fine design of different electron-donor and acceptor moieties.14–16 Specifically, rational adjustment of the electron-donating ability of the donor skeleton can guarantee a low-lying HOMO level of the resulting conjugated polymers, which is important to achieve the high open circuit voltages (Voc) of the related photovoltaic devices.17–19 A large number of new LBG conjugated polymers have been designed and prepared by synthetic chemists as donor materials for BHJ polymer solar cells, and great improvements in raising the PCE from 1% to over 10% for photovoltaic applications were achieved.20–35 Despite the great progress in these materials and devices, they need to have a good processability, a sufficient photochemical stability and device stability for practical application in large-area device production.36,37 Krebs and Lu groups studied the stability of the traditional conjugated polymers and the related PSCs, which implied that the reported laboratory PSCs were still far from the vision of the widely disseminated low cost organic solar cells as expected. So it is imperative to explore and develop new polymer systems with novel concepts maintaining the low cost objective of PSCs.33–40
Supramolecular chemistry is a relatively new field of chemistry and materials, which focuses quite literally on going “beyond” molecular chemistry.41 Inspired by nature, supramolecular chemistry has attracted wide attention to achieve sophisticated self-assembled structures from small building blocks by non-covalent interactions, such as the hydrogen bond, metal coordination, π–π interaction etc.42–44 The combination of supramolecular chemistry and polymer science has led to the appearance of supramolecular polymers, which are made up of repeating blocks held together with directional and reversible non-covalent forces.45–47 Thereby, the defined properties of small molecules and the processing advantages of polymers can be merged at the same time.41 Metallo-polymers are one kind of extensive supramolecular polymers, which are central to modern supramolecular chemistry, in which dynamic metal–ligand coordinative interactions serve as a reversible supramolecular polymerization motif.48 The properties of metallo-polymers can be widely varied due to the availability of a multitude of metal ions and organic ligands, which both have effects on binding strength, reversibility, stability and solubility.49 Metallo-polymers with potential applications in organic light emitting diodes,50–52 electrochromic devices,53,54 and sensory materials55–57 have been described. Just recently, some scientists incorporated zinc or ruthenium metals into conjugated backbones and applied the related metallo-polymers in PSCs.58–61 Chan et al. reported the first photovoltaic bis-terpyridyl Ru(II) complex containing the metallo-polymer (Ru–PPV) for fabrication of multilayer PSCs by the LBL deposition approach. The PCEs were only 0.95 × 10−3% to 4.4 × 10−3%.58 Mikroyannidis et al. synthesized similar metallo-polymers and used them as a buffer layer in BHJ PSCs along with a blending active layer of P3HT:PCBM (1:1 w/w). The maximum PCE value was obtained up to 0.71%.59 Subsequently, Lin et al. reported a series of main-chain Ru(II) metallo-polymers with different donor and acceptor bis-terpyridyl ligands and used them as donor materials in BHJ PSCs. These solar cell devices exhibited PCE values in the range of 0.06–0.9%.60,61 Compared with the traditional conjugated polymers, the PCE values of metallo-polymers were still very low due to the limited open-circuit voltage (Voc), low short circuit current (Jsc) as well as fill factor (FF). Since the programmed supramolecular polymers might open up a new avenue toward well-controlled supramolecular structures and purity with respect to conventional polymers, it is a challenge to develop novel supramolecular polymers with low-lying HOMO levels, low bandgaps and good morphologies for efficient PSC applications.
In this contribution, we describe the synthesis, characterization and photovoltaic properties of two novel Ru(II) containing supramolecular polymers with donor (D)–acceptor (A)–donor (D) bis-terpyridyl ligands (PHBTRU and PFBTRU) (Scheme 1). Ruthenium complexes were chosen here because they have received particular interest as excellent photosensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) application due to the favorable photoelectrochemical properties and high stability in the oxidized state, making potential practical applications feasible.62 State-of-the-art DSSCs based on ruthenium(II)–polypyridyl complexes as the active materials have overall PCEs over 11% under standard illumination.63 The insertion of ruthenium metals into conjugated backbones can also facilitate the charge generation by extending its absorption range due to its characteristic long-lived metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition.64 By incorporation of the cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene, thiophene donor units with benzodiazole and fluorinated benzodiazole acceptor units at the cores of bis-terpyridyl ligands in the prepared Ru(II) containing polymers, excellent thermal stabilities, good absorptions and ideal energy levels were obtained. The photovoltaic properties were also examined in detail with an optimized PCE of 2.66%, which is the best efficiency of the reported supramolecular polymer-based PSCs so far.

Characterization
The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were collected on a Bruker ARX 400 NMR spectrometer with d-chloroform as the solvent and tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. Mass spectra (matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, MALDI-TOF-MS) were measured on a Bruker BIFLEX III mass spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a TA Instrument Model SDT Q600 simultaneous TGA/DSC analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 flow rate of 90 mL min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were made on a CHI660 potentiostat/galvanostat electrochemical workstation at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, with a platinum wire counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode in an anhydrous nitrogen-saturated acetonitrile solution (0.1 mol L−1) of tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (Bu4NClO4). The copolymers were coated on the platinum plate working electrodes from dilute chloroform solutions. UV-vis spectra were obtained on a Carry 300 spectrophotometer. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated with ITO glass as an anode, Ca/Al as a cathode and the film blend of the copolymer and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the photosensitive layer. The photosensitive layer was prepared by spin-coating a solution blend of the copolymer and PC71BM in o-dichlorobenzene on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS electrode. The current density–voltage (J–V) characterization of the devices was carried out on a computer controlled Keithley 236 Source Measurement system. The EQE was measured at a chopping frequency of 280 Hz with a lock-in amplifier (Stanford, SR830 DSP) during illumination with the monochromatic light from a xenon lamp. A solar simulator was used as the light source, and the light intensity was monitored by a standard Si solar cell. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed on a Veeco Nanoscope V microscope in tapping mode. The thickness of the films was measured using a Dektak 6 M surface profilometer.

Synthesis of the supramolecular polymers
Polymer PHBTRU. Under the protection of argon, RuCl3·3H2O (0.025 g, 0.10 mmol) and AgBF4 (6.70 g, 0.35 mmol) were dissolved in 15 mL acetone and refluxed for 2 hours. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, the silver chloride (AgCl) precipitate was filtered off, and the solvent of filtrate was removed by evaporation. The residue was then redissolved in 15 mL n-butanol. After terpyridyl ligand 3a (0.156 g, 0.1 mmol) was added to the above mixture, the resulting solution was refluxed for 6 days. Once the precipitation of the formed polymer was observed on the wall of the bottle, a small portion of DMA was added to the mixture to redissolve the product. When the polymerization was finished, an excess of NH4PF6 (0.049 g, 0.3 mmol) in 20 mL DMA was subsequently added to the hot solution. The mixture was stirred at the same temperature for another 2 hours. The cooled reaction solution was poured into 300 mL methanol. The precipitate was filtered off and washed with another 300 mL methanol. The crude polymer was purified by repetitively dissolving the above product in a small amount of NMP and precipitating from diethyl ether. Finally, the purified polymer PHBTRU was collected and dried under vacuum at 50 °C for 12 hours to afford a dark solid with a yield of 62%. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 Hz, δ/ppm): 9.38 (br, 4H), 9.15 (br, 4H), 8.56–8.42 (m, 4H), 8.36–7.93 (m, 6H), 7.70 (br, 4H), 7.62 (br, 4H), 7.31 (br, 2H), 7.14 (br, 2H), 1.98–1.02 (m, 56H), 0.82 (m, 12H).

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes for the bis-terpyridyl ligands and supramolecular polymers are outlined in Scheme 2. In order to simplify the reaction steps and processes, compound 1 (1a and 1b) was synthesized by palladium catalyzed direct arylation between 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole or 4,7-dibromo-5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and 4,4-dioctyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene in the presence of K2CO3 and pivalic acid.66 Bromination of compound 1 using NBS could easily give compound 2 (2a and 2b) according to our previous work.65 The prepared dibromides were then reacted with 4′-(5-tributylstannanyl-thiophen-2-yl)-[2,2′;6′,2′′]terpyridine to afford the bis-terpyridyl ligand 3 (3a and 3b) by the palladium catalyzed Stille coupling method.10 The supramolecular polymers were synthesized by the self-assembly approach according to the polymerization process described before.67 Firstly, RuCl3 was activated by AgBF4 in acetone. The acetone Ru(III) complexes were then reacted with bis-terpyridyl ligands in the mixture solution of n-butanol–DMA, in which n-butanol was used as a reducing agent to transfer Ru(III) to Ru(II).60 The structures of the polymers were confirmed with NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, during the polymerization process, the typical 1H NMR signals (3,3′′,3,5′,4,4′,5,5′′,6,6′′) from the uncomplexed terpyridyl ligand gradually disappeared. The broadened and downfield shifted (3,3′′,3,5′,4,4′,5,5′′) or upfield shifted (6, 6′′) 1H NMR signals were observed after the supramolecular polymers had been formed.68,69 To further confirm the formation of the supramolecular polymers, the relative viscosity measurements of the resulting metallo-polymers were carried out. As control experiments, the viscosities (η) of bis-terpyridyl ligands 3a and 3b solutions (10 wt% in NMP) were measured by the same method and determined to be 6–7 cp at 25 °C. However, the viscosities of PHBTRU and PFBTRU were measured to be about 10–11 cp. The significantly increased viscosities were attributed to the coordination polymerization between the corresponding terpyridyl ligands and metal ions, which is in good agreement with the previous results known from the reported literature.52,60 So the molar masses of the resulting polymers were expected to be higher than 30000 g mol−1.70

Good thermal stability of the photovoltaic polymer materials is necessary for device fabrication and measurements. The thermal properties of the prepared polymers were evaluated from TGA results. As shown in Fig. 2, both polymers exhibited good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperatures (Td) of 417 °C (PHBTRU) and 432 °C (PFBTRU) under a nitrogen atmosphere (Table 1). PFBTRU with introduced fluorine atoms exhibited a higher Td value than that of PHBTRU due to the enhanced rigidity of the polymer backbones. However, no phase transition was observed in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) up to 300 °C, indicating that glass transition temperature (Tg) of these two coordination polymers are high enough. Such excellent thermal properties of PHBTRU and PFBTRU are adequately suitable for preventing the deformation and degradation of the blending active layer at elevated temperatures in PSC applications.

Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption properties of the obtained polymers were measured in both CHCl3 solutions (10−5 M) (Fig. 3a) and thin films spin-coated on quartz slides (Fig. 3b). The related photophysical data are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 3a, PHBTRU in solution present two absorption bands with the absorption maxima at 416 nm and 570 nm. The weak peak ranging from 350 to 450 nm can be attributed to the π–π* electronic transitions of the conjugated backbone of the ligands. Another strong and broad peak at low energy absorption arises from intramolecular change-transfer transitions (ICT) inside the ligands containing terpyridine, cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene and benzodiazole skeletons and metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT).15,16,52,60 The absorption of PFBTRU in solution shows similar behavior, but a little red-shifted ICT and π–π* electronic transition bands. It is interesting that PFBTRU shows an evident shoulder peak at about 610 nm, which indicates a certain degree of π–π stacking of the related polymer backbone even in the solution state. This stacking property was also confirmed with the true fact that PFBTRU exhibited the stronger intensity peak and broader absorption profile than PHBTRU without the fluorine atom. Therefore, F–H, F–S and/or F–F interactions induced polymer PFBTRU to form stronger stacking, which could be expected to have a higher carrier mobility and better photovoltaic performance in device applications. The absorption spectra of these supramolecular polymers in thin solid films were also shown in Fig. 3b. Relative to their counterparts in the solution state, the broad peaks in the wavelength range of 450–800 nm are red-shifted to about 38 and 40 nm for PHBTRU and PFBTRU, respectively. This bathochromic shift phenomenon can be explained by the formation of well oriented π-stacked structures in the solid state through better π–π intrachain interactions, which can facilitate charge transportation for increasing the efficiency of PSCs.10 From the wavelength of the optical absorption edge of the polymer films, the energy bandgaps were calculated to be about 1.64 and 1.62 eV for PHBTRU and PFBTRU, respectively. The introduction of the fluorine atom increases the electro-withdrawing characteristics of the benzodiazole acceptor and decreases the optical bandgaps, which is similar to the results obtained in our previous work.24 The primary results indicate that these low band gaps are important to enhance light harvesting and thus the photocurrent of the related PSCs because they are very close to the photon flux maximum of the solar spectrum.

Electrochemical properties
It is well known that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the photovoltaic polymers are important parameters affecting the performance of PSCs. The difference between the LUMO level of the polymer donor and the LUMO level of the PCBM derivative is able to influence the driving force for effective charge separation. The offset between the HOMO of copolymers and the LUMO of the PCBM derivative is related to the Voc of fabricated PSCs.10 To investigate the redox behavior and estimate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out under an inert atmosphere by using a three-electrode cell in an anhydrous CH3CN solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (n-Bu4NClO4). A platinum plate coated with a thin film of the studied polymer, a platinum wire and Ag/AgCl (0.1 M) were used as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. The energy level of the Ag/AgCl reference electrode was calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox system to be 4.40 eV by using previous methods.65 Therefore, the HOMO = −([Eonset]ox + 4.4) eV and LUMO = −([Eonset]red + 4.4) eV, where [Eonset]ox and [Eonset]red are the onset potentials for the oxidation and reduction of the polymers versus the Ag/AgCl reference electrode.65 The resulting oxidation and reduction curves of the polymer thin films are shown in Fig. 4a and the detailed electrochemical data are summarized in Table 1. Both polymers show reversible oxidation peaks due to the metal localized oxidation and redox transitions across the bridging ligands. A relatively weak and reversible reduction peak was also observed in cathodic sweep, which was assigned to the ligand-based reduction.52 From the onset potentials of the p-doping process, the HOMO energy levels were determined to be −5.22 and −5.27 eV for PHBTRU and PFBTRU, respectively. Since the Voc of PSCs correlated with the difference between the HOMO level of the polymer donors and the LUMO level of the fullerene acceptors, a higher Voc can thus be desirably expected because of the obtained low-lying HOMO energy levels. On the other hand, the LUMO energy levels of PHBTRU and PFBTRU were estimated to be −3.62 and −3.69 eV from the onset reduction potentials. Therefore, the electrochemical bandgaps (Eg) of PHBTRU and PFBTRU were calculated from their HOMO and LUMO to be about 1.60 and 1.58 eV, respectively. The changing trends are consistent with those obtained by the optical method described above. In order to make a clear comparison, the electronic energy level diagram of supramolecular polymers and PC71BM was described in Fig. 4b. The LUMO gap of 0.41–0.48 eV and the HOMO gap of 0.71–0.76 eV between the polymers and PC71BM are large enough to overcome the intrachain exciton binding energy and thus guarantee efficient exciton dissociation and transfer.71

Hole mobility
The hole mobility is an important parameter for polymer donor materials being used in PSCs. To evaluate the contribution of polymer mobility, hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/MoO3/Au, were fabricated and evaluated using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method reported previously.72 When a sufficient voltage is applied to this type of the device, the transport of holes through the polymer film is limited by the accumulated space charges. Thus, the mobility could be determined by fitting the dark current to the model of a single carrier SCLC, which is described by the following equation: J = 9ε0εrμhV2/8d3, where J is the current, μh is the zero-field mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, d is the thickness of the active layer, and V is the effective voltage. The effective voltage can be obtained by subtracting the built-in voltage (Vbi) and the voltage drop (Vs) from the substrate's series resistance from the applied voltage (Vappl), V = Vappl − Vbi − Vs. The hole mobilities can be calculated from the slopes of the J1/2–V curves, which are given in Fig. 5. As shown in Fig. 5, the calculated hole mobilities of PHBTRU and PFBTRU were determined to be 7.5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. PFBTRU exhibits a mobility one order of magnitude higher than PHBTRU because of the introduction of the fluorine atom, making the π–π stacking stronger due to the F–H, F–S and/or F–F interactions. This has been proved to be beneficial to enhance the current density, fill factor and device efficiency.24,73

Photovoltaic properties
In order to investigate the photovoltaic properties of the supramolecular polymers, the BHJ PSCs, with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al, were fabricated and evaluated according to our previous work,10,15,16,24,25 where the polymers were used as donors and PC71BM as the acceptor. PC71BM has a similar electronic structure to PC61BM, but a considerably stronger absorption in the visible region.74 The active layers of the related PSCs were fabricated from o-DCB solutions of PHBTRU/PFBTRU and PC71BM by the spin-coating method. Different fabrication conditions including the weight ratio between the donor and the acceptor and the thickness of the active layer were optimized. The performances were obtained with the varied weight ratios of polymer:PC71BM from 1:1 to 1:3 (w/w). The optimal weight ratio of polymer to PC71BM was found to be 1:2 for PHBTRU and PFBTRU in this work. The thickness of the active layer is about 80–95 nm, which could be controlled by changing both the spin-coating rate and the concentration of the solution. All devices were characterized under AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) illumination with simultaneous recording of their current–voltage characteristics. The open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSCs are summarized in Table 2, and the J–V characteristics and EQE curves are shown in Fig. 6a and b, respectively.

 Fig. 6  (a) Current–voltage curves of photovoltaic cells based on supramolecular polymers together with PC71BM under AM 1.5 illumination and (b) EQE curves of photovoltaic cells based on supramolecular polymers together with PC71BM (1:2). 
As shown in Fig. 6a and Table 2, PHBTRU exhibited the PCE of 1.33% at the weight ratio of PHBTRU:PC71BM of 1:1 (w/w). When the PHBTRU:PC71BM weight ratio was increased to 1:2, the optimized PCE of 1.99% was obtained with a Voc of 0.67 V, a Jsc of 6.17 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.48. Further increasing the PC71BM content would result in a decrease of the Jsc and PCE values of the PSCs, which could be attributed to the reduction of the polymer donor content and then the reduction of absorption and unbalanced hole–electron transportation of the active layer. To make a clear comparison, PSCs based on PFBTRU were fabricated and tested under the same conditions. The changing trend is the same as PHBTRU devices with the variation of polymer:PC71BM weight ratios from 1:1 to 1:3. The best performance was also achieved at a weight ratio of 1:2, and an optimized PCE of 2.66% with a Voc of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 7.12 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.51 were recorded. To the best of our knowledge, this efficiency obtained in this work is the highest performance of supramolecular polymers used in conventional BHJ PSCs without any additives and/or posttreatment of the active films. Compared with the PHBTRU device, the overall performance of this device was improved very much, including Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE. It is the truth that the Voc is dependent on the difference between the HOMO energy level of the donor and the LUMO energy level of the acceptor.10 As measured and discussed in the section of electrochemical properties, the HOMO of PFBTRU is 0.05 eV lower than that of PHBTRU. Therefore, the higher Voc of 0.73 V for the PFBTRU device was obtained and 0.06 V higher than that (0.67 V) of the device based on PHBTRU.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSCs based on PHBTRU:PC71BM and PFBTRU:PC71BM are shown in Fig. 6b. The shapes of the EQE curves of the related devices based on polymer:PC71BM are similar to their absorption spectra, which indicates that most of the absorbed photons of the polymers contribute to the photocurrent generation. The stronger absorption of PC71BM in the region of 350 to 550 nm had already compensated the limited absorption of the prepared polymers in this wavelength region. As shown in Fig. 6b, the PFBTRU device displayed higher photoconversion efficiency with the peak EQE value of over 40% than that of the device based on PHBTRU. This agrees with the improved Jsc of the devices based on PFBTRU with the help of introduced fluorine atoms. It can be also seen that the response range of the PHBTRU device covers almost the same as the PFBTRU device in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 750 nm, but the peak value of EQE is only 33%. It is obvious that the related photovoltaic performance of the PHBTRU device is limited by the low EQE response. The increased Jsc value can be further verified by the hole mobility obtained from the SCLC measurements. PFBTRU exhibits much higher hole mobility (2.8 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) than that of PHBTRU (7.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Obviously, the higher hole mobility makes positive contributions to the elevated Jsc.
Morphology of fine and controlled phase separation in the active layer is very important for the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. To avoid recombination of the generated excitons, the p/n heterojunction phase must be controlled at the nanoscale level because the diffusion range of the exciton is approximately 10 nm.75 Therefore, tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the fluorine atom effect on the morphology of the blend films of PHBTRU and PFBTRU devices. As shown in Fig. 7, PFBTRU:PC71BM (1:2) provided the evidence for larger phase separation compared to PHBTRU:PC71BM (1:2). The average surface roughness (Ra) values were 1.03 nm and 2.65 nm for the blends of PHBTRU:PC71BM and PFBTRU:PC71BM, respectively. These results indicated that the surface morphology of the polymer/PC71BM film is significantly influenced by the fluorine atom on the benzothiazole unit.24,73 Thus, this morphology of PFBTRU:PC71BM (1:2) has a more irregular and bicontinuous network with finer nanoscale features, which is favourable for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport, resulting in a higher Jsc, FF and PCE.22

Conclusions
In summary, we designed and synthesized two novel Ru(II) containing supramolecular polymers (PHBTRU and PFBTRU) with D–A–D bis-terpyridyl ligands using cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene as a donor block and benzodiazole/fluorinated benzodiazole as an acceptor block. Their formation and molecular structures were confirmed by 1H NMR spectra, elemental analysis, and relative viscosity experiments. These polymers show excellent thermal stabilities, good absorptions and low-lying HOMO energy levels. The introduction of fluorine atoms can elevate the decomposition temperature, reduce the optical bandgap, lower the HOMO level and increase the hole mobility. The photovoltaic performance was evaluated by PSCs with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The PCE of PHBTRU:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) was determined to be 1.99% with a Voc of 0.67 V, a Jsc of 6.17 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.48. The best PCE of 2.66% was obtained from PFBTRU:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) with improved Voc, Jsc and FF, which could be attributed to the positive effect of the fluorine atom on the HOMO level, bandgap, hole mobility as well as fine phase separation. To the best of our knowledge, the obtained performance in this work is the best result of the reported supramolecular polymers applied in conventional BHJ PSCs without any additives and/or posttreatment of the active films. Considering the advantages of supramolecular polymers, the presented results and the self-assembly approach may afford meaningful and highly efficient solution-processable polymer photovoltaic materials in PSCs.
