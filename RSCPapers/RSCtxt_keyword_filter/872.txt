    , Accepted 10th January 2012First published on 17th February 2012AbstractWe present a facile and effective method to prepare vertically aligned TiO2 nanorods (NRs) with a high density and rutile/anatase mixture phases on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) glasses. The anatase TiO2 nanoparticles grafted with hydrophilic poly(oxyethylene) methacrylate (POEM), which can coordinate with a TiO2 precursor such as Ti(BuO4), were introduced in the presence of glycine. Following application of a hydrothermal process and calcination at 450 °C, vertically well-aligned TiO2 NRs with diameters of 70 nm and lengths of 3 μm were generated, as confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The larger wavenumber shift observed with TiO2–POEM in FT-IR spectra suggests more favorable and stronger interactions that facilitate the nucleation and growth of NRs on the transparent conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates, resulting in increased NRs density. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) fabricated using TiO2 NRs with a high density and rutile/anatase mixture phases exhibited improved energy conversion efficiency, irrespective of the type of electrolyte. When liquid electrolyte was used, the DSSCs exhibited an efficiency of 5.7% at 100 mW cm−2, which is the highest value for DSSCs fabricated with NRs directly grown on TCO substrates. High cell efficiencies of 4.5 and 3.7% were also obtained with quasi-solid-state and solid-state electrolytes, respectively, due to the reduced interfacial resistance of electrolyte/electrode and improved electron transport.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were first developed by the Gratzel group in 1991.1 Since their development, they have become a potential alternative to replace conventional Si-based inorganic solar cells due to their relatively low production cost and considerable overall energy conversion efficiency of 10–11%.1 A DSSC consists of a sensitizing dye, a transparent conducting oxide (TCO), a nanocrystalline mesoporous titanium oxide (TiO2) film, an electrolyte containing the I−/I3− redox couple, and a platinum-coated counter electrode. In particular, the preparation of nanostructured TiO2 photoelectrodes and the control of the electrode/electrolyte interface are of pivotal importance for improving the efficiencies of DSSCs.2–10
TiO2 nanoparticles with sizes of 10–20 nm have been typically used to construct a mesoporous photoelectrode for use in DSSCs. However, slow electron transport through the particulate TiO2 film with a large grain boundary often increases the recombination probability between injected electrons and electron acceptors in redox species.2–4 Furthermore, large molecular weight (Mw) solid polymer electrolytes or hole transporting materials (HTMs) cannot infiltrate the nanopores of TiO2 films with a randomly disordered structure, resulting in poor interfacial contact of the electrode/electrolyte and thus a low efficiency in solid-state DSSCs.6–8 Thus, well-defined mesoporous TiO2 films such as those used in nanorods, nanowires, nanotubes and nanosheets have attracted much attention recently.11–15 In particular, vertically aligned one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures have been considered to improve the cell performance due to facilitated electron transfer through the recombination reduction of photoinjected electrons.16–19 For example, the Grimes group grew vertically oriented 2–3 μm long TiO2 nanowires on TCO glass and obtained a conversion efficiency of 5.0% at 100 mW cm−2 when using a liquid electrolyte.18 The Aydil group also developed an effective way to grow 4 μm oriented, single-crystalline rutile TiO2 nanorods (NRs) on TCO glass and achieved an efficiency of 3% after TiCl4 treatment.19 However, there has been no reported efficiency greater than 5.0% due to the limited NRs density and rutile phase.
In this work, we report a facile and efficient method for growing vertically aligned TiO2 NRs with a higher density and rutile/anatase mixture phases on TCO glass, resulting in further improvement in the DSSC efficiency. Synthesized TiO2 NRs were characterized in detail by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The resultant TiO2 NRs were used as a photoelectrode in DSSCs and their performances were systematically compared using four kinds of electrolytes: (1) a liquid electrolyte consisting of LiI, I2 and 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile, (2) a quasi-solid-state (QSS) electrolyte consisting of low molecular weight (Mw) poly(ethylene glycol dimethyl ether) (PEGDME), fumed silica nanoparticles (SiO2), 1-methyl-3-propyl imidazolium iodide (MPII) and I2, (3) a solid-state (SS) electrolyte consisting of high Mw poly(vinyl chloride)-g-poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) (PVC-g-POEM) graft copolymer, MPII and I2, and (4) I2-free hole transporting materials (HTM) consisting of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS).
Experimental
Materials
Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP, 97%), hydrogen chloride solution (HCl, 35 wt%), glycine (99%), titanium(IV) butoxide (Ti(BuO)4, 97%), fumed silica nanoparticles (SiO2, 14 nm), poly(ethylene glycol) dimethyl ether (PEGDME, Mn = 500 g mol−1), iodine (I2), titanium(IV) bis(ethyl acetoacetato) diisopropoxide, chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonimide (LiTFSI), lithium iodide (LiI), 3-methoxypropionitrile and sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH, 0.1 N) were purchased from Aldrich. Distilled water was obtained from a water purification system made by Millipore Corporation. Commercial TiO2 powder (P25) was provided by Degussa, Germany. Ruthenium dye (535-bisTBA, N719), 1-methyl-3-propyl imidazolium iodide (MPII) and 60 μm thick Surlyn were purchased from Solaronix, Switzerland. Acetonitrile, butanol, isopropanol, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and ethanol were purchased from J. T. Baker. The transparent conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass substrates (TEC8, 8 ohms sq−1, 2.3 mm thick) were purchased from Pilkington, France. All solvents and chemicals were of reagent grade and were used as received without further purification.
Preparation of vertically aligned TiO2 nanorods (NRs)
Transparent glass coated with conductive FTO was used as the photoelectrode. The glass was cleaned via sonication in isopropanol and then in chloroform. The procedure used to synthesize the vertically aligned TiO2 NRs consisted of two steps. First, nanocrystal seeds were formed on the FTO substrate via spin coating of 0.01 M TTIP in isopropanol, followed by calcination at 450 °C for 2 h. Next, 0.04 mol L−1 glycine was added to an acidic aqueous solution with a pH of 1.1 under stirring, and Ti(BuO)4 at a concentration of 0.14 mol L−1 was added to the solution under stirring until a transparent solution was obtained. In order to prepare TiO2 NR-2 and NR-3, 1 g each of TiO2 (P25) and TiO2–poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) (TiO2–POEM) was added. The vertically aligned TiO2 NR arrays were grown on the nanocrystal seeds by immersing the seeded FTO substrate in the above sol–gel solution at 150 °C for 6 h in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. After the hydrothermal process, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, and the vertically aligned TiO2 NRs deposited on the FTO glass were washed several times with deionized water and dried under air. Then, TiO2 NRs were sintered at 450 °C for 30 min and cooled to 30 °C for 8 h. The TiO2 NR photoelectrodes were sensitized overnight in a Ru(dcbpy)2(NCS)2 dye (dcbpy = 2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylato) solution (N719, 535-bisTBA, Solaronix, 13 mg, dissolved in 50 g distilled ethanol).
Fabrication of DSSCs
DSSCs with an active area of 0.40 cm2 were constructed via drop-casting of an electrolyte onto the photoelectrode and covering with the counter electrode, using our previously reported procedure.20–22 In particular, the DSSCs with liquid electrolyte were assembled using 60 μm thick Surlyn, then the inner spaces of the DSSCs were filled with a liquid electrolyte solution through a drilled hole on the counter electrode. The liquid electrolyte solution was composed of 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2 and 0.5 M TBP in 3-methoxypropionitrile. The counter electrodes were prepared via spin coating of a 4 wt% H2PtCl6 isopropanol solution onto the conductive FTO glass, followed by sintering at 450 °C for 30 min. A low molecular weight (Mw) polymer electrolyte solution was prepared by dissolving SiO2, PEGDME, MPII and I2 in acetonitrile. A high Mw polymer electrolyte solution was prepared by dissolving poly(vinyl chloride)-g-poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) (PVC-g-POEM) in THF, followed by the addition of an MPII and I2 solution in acetonitrile. The PVC-g-POEM graft copolymer with a weight ratio of 40:60 was synthesized via ATRP (Mw = 105631 g mol−1, PDI = 2.2). A hole transporting material (HTM) solution was prepared by dissolving PEDOT:PSS in ethanol, followed by the addition of the solution containing MPII (1.0 M), TBP (0.2 M) and LiTFSI (0.2 M) in acetonitrile. The DSSCs except for the liquid electrolyte were placed in a vacuum oven at room temperature for one day to allow complete evaporation of the solvent and were then sealed with an epoxy resin.
The photoelectrochemical performances were measured using a Keithley Model 2400 and a 1000 W xenon lamp (Oriel, 91193). The light was homogeneous over an 8 × 8 in2 area, and its intensity was calibrated with a Si solar cell (Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, Mono-Si + KG filter, certificate no. C-ISE269) at a sunlight intensity of 1 (100 mW cm−2). This calibration was verified with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell (PV Measurements Inc.). The photoelectrochemical performances were evaluated using the following equations. (1) (2)where Jsc is the short-circuit current density (mA cm−2), Voc is the open-circuit voltage (V), Pin is the incident light power, FF is the fill factor, η is the overall energy conversion efficiency and Jmax (mA cm−2) and Vmax (V) are the current density and voltage in the J–V curve, respectively, at the point of the maximum power output.
The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured with a CompactStat electrochemistry analyzer (IVIUM Technologies) with frequencies ranging from 0.01 Hz to 0.1 MHz and a potential modulation of 0.02 V under AM 1.5 (at 100 mW cm−2) light illumination.
Characterization
The surface structures of the electrodes were characterized using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (SUPRA 55VP, NICEM, Carl Zeiss). The thermal property of TiO2 nanoparticles was determined by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA, Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e, Columbus, OH) from room temperature to 700 °C at a rate of 20 °C min−1. Tapping mode atomic force microscopy (TM-AFM) (Nanoscope IV, Digital Instruments) was used to examine the morphologies of TiO2 nanoparticles. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments were performed on a Rigaku 18 kW rotating anode X-ray generator with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) at 40 kV and 300 mA. The 2θ range was extended from 5° to 60° at a scan speed of 3° min−1, and the distance from the sample to the detector was 185 mm. For the measurements, TiO2 samples were detached from the FTO substrate to avoid overlapping with the diffraction lines of the FTO substrate. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of the samples were collected using an Excalibur Series FT-IR (DIGLAB Co.) instrument at wavenumbers ranging from 4000 to 600 cm−1. Using the ATR facility, 64 scans were signal-averaged at a resolution of 4 cm−1.
Results and discussion
The fabrication procedures used for the vertically aligned TiO2 NR photoelectrodes are schematically illustrated in Scheme 1. Nanocrystal TiO2 seeds were formed on an F-doped SnO2 (FTO) substrate via spin-coating of 0.01 M titanium(IV) isopropoxide (TTIP) in isopropanol, followed by calcination at 450 °C for 2 h.23 A hydrothermal process using a titanium(IV) butoxide (Ti(BuO4)), HCl and glycine mixture at 150 °C for 6 h led to the growth of vertically aligned TiO2 NRs on the FTO glass. The presence of glycine in the reaction medium leads to its interaction with the precursor Ti(BuO4), resulting in retardation of crystalline nucleation.24,25 TiO2 nanoparticles grafted with a hydrophilic polymer such as poly(oxyethylene) methacrylate (POEM) which can coordinate with Ti(BuO4) were introduced in a hydrothermal process. TiO2–POEM nanoparticles were synthesized via atomic transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) using a two-step synthesis method.26 The grafting degree of POEM chains in TiO2–POEM nanoparticles was determined to be 10 wt% or 31 vol% assuming mass densities of 1.05 and 4.23 g cm−3 for POEM and TiO2, respectively, as characterized by the TGA curve in Fig. 1. The grafted morphology of TiO2–POEM nanoparticles was directly observed using AFM images, as shown in Fig. 2. Pristine unmodified TiO2 nanoparticles were also used in the control experiments.

The structural evolution of the TiO2 NRs was confirmed using cross-sectional and top-view FE-SEM images, as shown in Fig. 3. The surface of the FTO substrate was homogeneously covered with vertically aligned TiO2 NRs with lengths of 3 μm and diameters of 70 nm, indicating uniform growth anisotropy. Preferential growth in the y-axial [001] direction over that in the x-axial [110] direction was facilitated by the formation of a nanocrystal TiO2 seed layer on the FTO substrate, which offers a larger population of nucleation sites perpendicular to the FTO substrate. Despite the similar heights and diameters of NRs, their packing densities varied significantly among the three systems in the order of TiO2 NR-3 > NR-2 > NR-1. The interactions of glycine with Ti(BuO4) are present in the formation of all three TiO2 NRs. The additional interactions between TiO2 nanoparticles and Ti(BuO4) result in a further decrease in the hydrolysis of Ti(BuO)4, which leads to retardation of the nucleation crystallization. This may help to produce a greater number of seeded particles participating in the nucleation of NRs, resulting in a further increase in the TiO2 NR density. The surface-modified TiO2, i.e., TiO2–POEM, in the precursor solution has more and stronger interaction sites than does pristine TiO2 due to the carbonyl (CO) and ether (–O–) groups in the POEM. This results in a further reduction of the release of butoxide ions in Ti(BuO)4, and thus, the number of crystallization sites can be increased further.

The crystal phase of TiO2 is also an important factor that directly influences the cell performance since it is related to the electron transfer properties and the amount of dye adsorption. The crystal structure and phase of the vertically aligned TiO2 NRs were investigated using XRD analysis, as shown in Fig. 4. TiO2 NR-1 showed two sharp crystalline peaks including a strong peak at 62.6° and a weak peak at 36.2°, corresponding to tetragonal (002) and (101) orientations of the rutile TiO2 phase, respectively (ICDD-JCPDS database, no. 88-1175). The strong intensity of the (002) reflection indicates the growth of vertically aligned TiO2 NRs on the FTO substrate, which is consistent with the FE-SEM images. The preferential formation of the rutile phase arises from the mismatch value (<2%) between the tetragonal lattice FTO substrate and the TiO2 rutile phase, which facilitates the epitaxial nucleation and direct growth of rutile TiO2 NRs.19,27,28 Upon introduction of neat TiO2 (NR-2) and TiO2–POEM (NR-3) nanoparticles into the precursor solution, several diffraction peaks additionally appeared at 2θ values of 25.5, 38.0, 48.2, 54.3, and 55.2°, assigned to the (101), (004), (200), (105), and (211) orientations of the TiO2 anatase phase (ICDD-JCPDS no. 86-1157), respectively, all of which are involved in the growth mechanism of the vertically aligned TiO2 NRs during the hydrothermal process. It is interesting that TiO2 NR-3 exhibited a more intense (A101) peak than did TiO2 NR-2 although the amount of anatase TiO2 in the former is smaller than that in the latter. The same amounts (1 g) of TiO2 and TiO2–POEM were used, but the amount of TiO2 in TiO2–POEM was smaller due to the presence of the POEM chains. The actual amount of TiO2 in TiO2–POEM was approximately 0.9 g due to the 10 wt% grafting degree, as determined by the TGA curve shown in Fig. 1. The volume percent of POEM in TiO2–POEM was calculated to be 31%, which is large enough for the interactions with Ti(BuO)4. The stronger intensity of the (A101) peak in NR-3 indicates that TiO2–POEM nanoparticles are more effective in facilitating the vertical growth of TiO2 NRs due to their favorable interaction with Ti(BuO)4, leading to retardation of the nucleation process. However, there was no significant difference in the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the anatase (A101) diffraction peaks between TiO2 NR-2 and NR-3, indicating similar crystallite sizes of the anatase phase. The weight fractions of the anatase and rutile phases present in the vertically aligned TiO2 NRs were estimated using the most intense signals, (A101) and (R002), of each phase. As a result, the weight percentages of the anatase/rutile phases in TiO2 NR-1, NR-2 and NR-3 were determined to be (0/100), (28/72) and (40/60)%, respectively. As described earlier, rutile phase TiO2-based DSSCs often suffer limited photoconversion efficiencies due to their low surface areas, which allow for restricted dye loading. Thus, vertically aligned TiO2 NR-3 provides the greatest possibility to facilitate the electron transport rate and improve dye loading.

To investigate the mechanism of growth of vertically aligned TiO2 NRs, the interactions between the precursor Ti(BuO)4 and additives (TiO2 and TiO2–POEM) before calcination at 450 °C were investigated using FT-IR spectroscopy, and the corresponding spectra are presented in Fig. 5. The TiO2 NR-1 spectrum had a broad absorption band at 3317 cm−1, which is ascribed to the stretching vibration of the H–O–H group in Ti(BuO)4 sol and/or its hydrolyzed gel. Other characteristic CO stretching (1720 cm−1) and –NH2 scissor (1627 cm−1) bands were also observed in the TiO2 NRs spectra due to the presence of glycine.29 Upon introduction of TiO2 and TiO2–POEM, the stretching vibrations of the H–O–H groups shifted significantly to 3261 and 3207 cm−1, respectively, indicating their hydrogen bonding interactions. The larger wavenumber shift observed with TiO2–POEM suggests more favorable and stronger interactions that facilitate the nucleation and successful growth of TiO2 on the FTO substrates. However, the absorption bands at 1720 and 1627 cm−1 remained almost unchanged, implying that glycine plays a role only as a catalyst in the growth mechanism. The interaction mechanism in the vertically aligned TiO2 NR-3 is illustrated in Scheme 2.

The J–V curves of the DSSCs fabricated with three vertically aligned TiO2 NRs and four electrolytes were measured at 100 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. 6–9, and their photovoltaic performances are summarized in Table 1. When liquid electrolyte was used, the DSSC fabricated with TiO2 NR-1 exhibited 3.5 % at 100 mW cm−2, which was increased up to 4.5% by using TiO2 NR-2. The TiO2 NR-3 photoelectrode showed an efficiency of 5.7%, which is even greater than the reported efficiencies by the Grimes group18 or the Aydil group.19 The high performances of the TiO2 NR-3-based cells are attributed to the larger dye adsorption amounts and higher anatase phase contents. The increased dye loading is due to the increase in the surface area of the TiO2 photoelectrode, resulting from the increased NR packing density. The increase in the anatase phase of the TiO2 NRs also contributes to the enhancement of the Jsc value. A similar tendency was obtained for QSS-based DSSCs; TiO2 NR-3 (4.5%) > TiO2 NR-2 (3.3%) > TiO2 NR-1 (2.6%).

It is important to consider solid-state electrolyte or I2-free HTM in order to understand the reasons underlying the better performance of the TiO2 NR-3 photoelectrode. Interestingly, the DSSC performances of the TiO2 NR-3 photoelectrode were almost two-fold higher than those of pristine TiO2 NR-1 with the use of solid-state high Mw polymer electrolytes and I2-free HTM, i.e. TiO2 NR-3 (3.7%) > TiO2 NR-1 (1.9%) for PVC-g-POEM/MPII/I2 and TiO2 NR-3 (1.7%) > TiO2 NR-1 (0.8%) for PEDOT:PSS. These result from the good interfacial contact of the electrode/electrolyte due to the well-defined, vertically aligned structures of the TiO2 NR photoelectrode. In general, the large gyration radius (Rg) of the high Mw polymer electrolyte precludes easy penetration into the nanopores of the TiO2 photoelectrode. However, the pore size of the TiO2 NR photoelectrode is smaller than the average size radius of gyration (approximately 100 nm) of the high Mw PVC-g-POEM electrolyte, leading to good pore filling properties of the high Mw electrolyte. Thus, the differences in energy conversion efficiencies are due to the differences in dye loading and anatase phase contents that result in different incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs), as shown in Fig. 10. It should be also noted that the efficiency of 1.7% obtained from TiO2 NR-3 with HTM is one of the highest values for I2-free solid-state DSSCs fabricated with a commercially available PEDOT:PSSA conducting polymer. In general, I2-free solid-state DSSCs employing HTM have been fabricated using in situ photoelectropolymerization to allow sufficient penetration of the conducting polymer into the TiO2 nanopores,7,8 which is more complicated and costly than our approach. With regard to I2-free solid-state DSSCs with HTM, not only energetic matching of the HTM with dye molecules but also the mobility of the HTM and dyed TiO2 layers must be balanced to improve the efficiency.9 Another key issue is the buildup of well-organized interfaces that create non-bonding but electronic contacts with one another at TiO2/sensitizer/HTM and HTM/cathode.9 Because the Pt metal was used as a cathode, the efficiency would be further improved upon the introduction of other metals such as Au, which is currently under investigation in our lab.

Internal resistance and charge-transfer kinetics of TiO2 NR photoelectrodes in DSSCs were investigated using EIS analysis, as shown in Fig. 11. An applied bias of Voc at a frequency range from 0.01 Hz to 0.1 MHz was used, with an AC amplitude of 0.02 V and light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 11 shows the Nyquist plots and Bode phase of DSSC for different types of TiO2 NR photoelectrodes. Electrochemical parameters, i.e. resistance values (Rs, R1, R2, and Ws), minimum angular frequency (ωmin), and lifetime of electrons for recombination (τr) are summarized in Table 2. Each equivalent circuit consisted of several components: ohmic resistance (Rs), charge transfer resistance at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface (R1), charge transfer resistance at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface (R2), resistance at the Warburg diffusion of the redox I−/I3− couple in the electrolyte (Ws), constant phase element of capacitance corresponding to R1 (CPE1), and constant phase element of capacitance corresponding to R2 (CPE2). The three different DSSCs exhibited similar values of Rs, R1, and Ws, indicating that TiO2 NR structures have little effect on FTO glass resistance, on charge transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface, or at Warburg diffusion of the redox I−/I3− couple in the electrolyte. However, the second semicircle values, in the middle-frequency region, exhibited substantial differences, corresponding to the charge transfer resistance at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface. A reduced charge transfer resistance value (R2) was observed, from 83 Ω for the TiO2 NR-1 to 50 Ω for the TiO2 NR-3 photoelectrode. It indicates that the specific surface area of the TiO2 NR-3 photoelectrode is larger than that of the TiO2 NR-1, which leads to a more efficient electron transfer, thereby reducing the corresponding resistance at the interface.

According to the EIS model, the lifetime of electrons for recombination (τr) in the TiO2 photoelectrode can be estimated from the minimum angular frequency (ωmin) value of the impedance semicircle at middle frequencies in the Bode spectrum, according to the following relation, τr = 1/ωmin. The middle frequencies in Bode spectra of TiO2 NR-1, NR-2 and NR-3 shifted to lower frequencies sequentially; the corresponding ωmin values were 16.4 Hz for TiO2 NR-1, 7.7 Hz for TiO2 NR-2 and 5.8 Hz for TiO2 NR-3. The τr values for DSSCs with TiO2 NR-1, NR-2 and NR-3 photoelectrodes were 61.1, 130.2 and 172.4 ms, respectively. The τr value of the electrons in the TiO2 NR-3 was the longest and was approximately three-fold higher than that of NR-1. This demonstrates that the collection and transport of electrons in TiO2 NR-3 were much faster than those in the other NRs, thereby effectively retarding the charge recombination and increasing the electron recombination lifetime in the TiO2 photoelectrode. The higher τr value of TiO2 NR-3 can result in an increase in the Voc value, which is directly related to the recombination or back reactions occurring at the TiO2 photoelectrode/electrolyte interface and the electron density in the conduction band.30
Conclusions
In summary, a facile and efficient method was developed for the direct growth of vertically aligned TiO2 NRs with high density and rutile/anatase mixture phases on TCO glass. The method involves the introduction of TiO2 nanoparticles grafted with hydrophilic POEM, which can coordinate with a TiO2 precursor such as Ti(BuO4) through a hydrothermal process. The TiO2 NRs with diameters of 70 nm and lengths of 3 μm were vertically well-aligned, as confirmed by FE-SEM and XRD analysis. The energy conversion efficiencies of DSSCs fabricated using the modified TiO2 NR-3 were significantly improved by approximately two-fold, irrespective of the type of electrolyte, due to the reduced charge recombination, increased NR density and rutile/anatase mixture phases. Energy conversion efficiencies of 5.7, 4.5, 3.7, and 1.7% were obtained at 100 mW cm−2 when using liquid, QSS, SS electrolytes and I2-free HTM, respectively, representing some of the highest values for DSSCs fabricated with NRs directly grown on TCO substrates.
