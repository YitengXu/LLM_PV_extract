    , Accepted 5th March 2019First published on 7th March 2019AbstractWhile the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) is still far below their theoretical efficiency, we herein provide a method to improve the solar cell performance by using carbon nanoparticles as a template to construct TiO2 mesoporous photoanodes. Carbon nanoparticles are obtained by microwave synthesis and are further mixed with TiO2 nanoparticles as a paste, and the photoanodes are prepared by spin-coating followed by thermal treatment. In comparison to the photoanodes fabricated from pure TiO2 nanoparticles, the performance of the cells that are prepared from the carbon nanoparticle template assisted mesoporous TiO2 photoanodes show obvious improvement. The best performance is achieved with a carbon nanoparticle content of 15 wt% in the photoanode. A maximum PCE of 4.41% is achieved, giving a 35.3% enhancement in cell efficiency. Systematic investigations are carried out to reveal the role of the carbon nanoparticles in the photoanode performance and the corresponding mechanism is proposed.
1. Introduction
Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) as one of the most promising photovoltaic devices have attracted great attention in realizing low-cost and high-performance solar cells. Since the breakthrough work reported by Toyoda and coworkers in 2007, the certified highest PCE of QDSSCs has been enhanced to 12.07% over the past few years, making them more competitive with other emerging photovoltaic devices.1,2 The structure of QDSSCs follows the traditional framework of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), containing a conductive glass substrate, titanium dioxide (TiO2) backbone scaffold, quantum dot (QD) sensitizing agent, passivation layer, electrolyte solution and counter electrode.3–5 The QD sensitizing agent plays an important role because of its unique properties including high-extinction coefficients, low cost, tunable band gap and multiple exciton generation.6,7 In addition, the contact between the QDs and TiO2 backbone scaffold is critical for efficient QDSSCs. For a better formation of the interface between QDs and TiO2, the morphology features and composite structures of TiO2 play an important role.
In order to obtain an excellent TiO2 backbone scaffold that provides a larger effective specific surface and better light scattering ability, great efforts have been made. These could be divided into two categories. The first one is to synthesize TiO2 with different morphologies, such as the nanotube, nanoflower, nanowire, hollow sphere, nanosheet, nanorod, nanocup and their composite structures.8–15 The second is to prepare mesoporous TiO2 backbone scaffolds using different kinds of pore-forming templates such as monodisperse polystyrene, amphiphilic graft copolymers, ultrastable foams, graphene oxide nanosheets, silica and so on.16–21 A TiO2 nanoparticle thin film that possesses a huge specific surface area functions as not only the scaffold for the deposition of QDs but also as the electron injection and deposition layer for the effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs.22,23 The pores formed in the mesoporous TiO2 thin film have to be appropriate in size with outstanding QD loading capability and excellent mutual connection for the efficient diffusion of electrolyte. The selection of pore-forming template plays an important role. Most pore-forming templates are various organic components because they can be converted to gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) easily after high-temperature thermal treatment in an air atmosphere. But, organic components possess several disadvantages such as high cost and complicated preparation requirements compared to a pure CNP template. Besides the well-known organic components and SiO2, the literature about the formation techniques of pores by pore-forming templates is still limited.24 Therefore, developing low-cost and simple agents to prepare TiO2 mesoporous film is still necessary. Carbon is considered as a low-cost and environmentally friendly element. CNPs have attracted wide attention because of their fluorescent property. In addition to this special property, CNPs also have the following advantages: (i) the preparation process is simple and fast. It only takes about ten minutes of microwave heating. (ii) The materials are extensive. Urea, citric acid and even soy milk and watermelon can be used as raw materials. (iii) They can be converted into CO2 by calcination at high temperature in air. This indicates that they can be used as a template in preparing mesoporous membranes. Zhao Li et al. successfully prepared mesoporous TiO2 film in DSSCs with laminar graphene oxide (GO) as a template and obtained the efficiency of 4.01%.20 However, CNPs as a template for the preparation of mesoporous film in QDSSCs have not been reported.
In the present work, in consideration of the advantages of CNPs discussed above, we synthesized CNPs by a microwave synthesis method and used them as pore-forming templates in preparing TiO2 mesoporous film. The overall improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) was confirmed using the template-assisted photoanodes in contrast to the without-template photoanodes. When the mass ratio is 15% (CNPs:CNPs + TiO2), an optimal efficiency of 4.41% with a Voc of 0.62 V, Jsc of 14.40 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.49 was obtained, giving a 35.3% enhancement in overall device performance.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Urea, α-terpinol, ethylcellulose, sodium sulphide (Na2S·9H2O), sulfur powder, glacial acetic acid, cadmium acetate, zinc acetate and anhydrous sodium sulfite were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Titanium dioxide (anatase, 99.8% metal basis, 25 nm) was bought from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. Absolute ethyl alcohol and citric acid were obtained from Beijing Chemical Works. Se powder (Se, 200 mesh), copper sulfate (CuSO4·5H2O) and sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3·5H2O) were bought from Tianjin Guangfu Technology Development Co., Ltd. Trisodium nitrilotriacetate monohydrate (C6H6NNa3O6·H2O) was bought from TCI Shanghai. FTO conducting glass (<15 Ohm sq−1, 1.6 mm in thickness) was bought from Zhuhai Kaivo.
2.2 Synthesis of CNPs
The CNPs were synthesized using the microwave synthesis method, which was reported previously.25 Briefly, 6 g of urea (CON2H4) and 3 g of citric acid were dissolved in 10 ml of deionized water in a beaker, followed by heating in a microwave reactor with a power of 650 W for 10 minutes. The resulting black solid was fully ground into a brown powder.
2.3 Preparation of TiO2 mesoporous film constructed by CNPs
TiO2 mesoporous film was prepared by spin-coating a paste containing 0.8 g of TiO2, 0.4 g of ethyl cellulose, 4 ml of anhydrous ethanol, and 3.245 g of α-terpinol on fully cleaned FTO substrates. Then, all the spin-coated samples were annealed in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 60 min. In order to prepare TiO2 mesoporous film constructed by CNPs, CNPs with different mass ratios (CNPs:CNPs + TiO2) of 10%, 15%, and 20% were mixed into the paste. The TiO2 mesoporous film with addition of 0 g is abbreviated as 0%, while those with additions of 0.08, 0.12 and 0.16 g are abbreviated as 10%, 15%, and 20%, respectively.
2.4 Preparation of CdSe–CdS co-sensitized TiO2 mesoporous film constructed by CNP photoanodes
The inner CdS QD layer was coated by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method.26,27 CdSe QDs were coated by a chemical bath deposition (CBD) method. In detail, a solution containing the Cd2+ and Se2− source was prepared by the following method. 1.55 g of Na2SO3 was dissolved in 25 ml of deionized water. 0.155 g of Se powder as the Se2− source was added into the above solution. The obtained solution was heated in an oil bath at 120 °C for 3 hours under stirring. The Cd2+ solution was prepared by mixing 25 ml of a nitrilotriacetic acid deionized water solution (120 mM) and 25 ml of a Cd(AC)2·2H2O deionized water solution (80 mM). Then, the prepared Se2− solution and Cd2+ solution were mixed together. The as-prepared CdS-coated photoanodes were put into the above mixed solution for 1.5 h in the dark. Finally, a ZnS passivation layer was coated by dipping photoanodes into 0.1 M Zn(AC)2·2H2O solution and 0.1 M Na2S·9H2O sequentially. This process was executed twice.
2.5 Assembly of QDSSCs
The CuS counter electrodes were prepared by the CBD method according to a previous report.28 The polysulfide electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 2.4 g of sodium sulfide and 0.32 g of sulfur powder in 10 ml of methanol/deionized water (v:v = 7:3) solution. Finally, the CuS counter electrode, polysulfide electrolyte and different photoanodes were assembled into sandwiched structure devices divided by a polymer gasket filled with the polysulfide electrolyte. Scheme 1 shows the device assembly procedure.

2.6 Characterization and measurements
The crystalline types of the materials were confirmed by X-ray diffraction (a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer). The physical size and morphologies of samples were observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai F20) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, S4800, Hitachi). The pore size distributions and specific surface area of TiO2 mesoporous films were measured using a TriStar II 3020 (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, USA). The diffuse reflectance spectra were measured using a UV/Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3150). Impedance parameters were recorded using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660C, Shanghai) at room temperature. The photovoltaic performances (J–V curves) were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination of an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd).
3. Results and discussion
The morphologies of the TiO2 mesoporous films constructed by CNPs in top view and cross section are shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1(a)–(d) are SEM images in top view corresponding to different contents of CNPs (0%, 10%, 15%, and 20%). It could be observed that the roughness of the TiO2 films obviously increases with the increasing amount of CNPs and they possess more hierarchical pores. Hierarchical pores are distributed evenly throughout the TiO2 mesoporous films with different size. This illustrates that the pore structure was successfully constructed by the CNPs and P25. A proper pore structure can improve the specific surface area of the TiO2 film.17 As shown in Fig. 1(f)–(h), the thickness of the TiO2 mesoporous film constructed by the CNPs is the same as in Fig. 1(e), about 10 μm. It is worth mentioning that the pore structure with a content of 20% is too large (about 200 nm) so that it forms a crack structure. This crack structure is beneficial for full contact between electrolyte and photoanode but does harm to the loading of QDs.

Fig. 2(a) and (b) show typical SEM and TEM images of the CNPs. They reveal that the CNPs are spherical and have sizes in the range from 30 to 50 nm. Fig. 2(c) shows the digital photographs of the TiO2 mesoporous films spin-coated on FTO before (top line) and after (bottom line) thermal treatment. With the addition of CNPs, the color of the film changed from white to yellow and dark yellow with the increase of CNPs. After thermal treatment, all of the samples became white because of the disappearance of CNPs.

The crystal phase formation of the as-prepared CNPs and TiO2 mesoporous film constructed by CNPs on FTO were characterized by XRD and the results are shown in Fig. 3. From line a, several characteristic peaks could be observed attributed to SnO2 (rutile structure) of the FTO substrate (JCPDS file No. 41-1445).29 In line d, a broad peak at 27.1° could be observed, which is attributed to the plane of (002). This shows that the CNPs are typically amorphous in nature.30 After spin-coating with the TiO2 mesoporous film, the emerging diffraction peaks show up at 48.13°, 25.32°, 55.16°, 53.93° and 62.73° corresponding to the (004), (101), (105), (200) and (204) planes of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS 84-1285).31 From the XRD pattern of line c, it is clear that the mixing of CNPs does not cause any other diffraction peaks to appear after the heat treatment in the air atmosphere. This demonstrates that CNPs have been removed and the mixing of CNPs does not change the original anatase TiO2 structure.

The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm spectrograms and the corresponding Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distributions of TiO2 mesoporous film without and with CNPs are shown in Fig. 4 and the physical characteristics are listed in Table 1. The results indicate a typical mesoporous structure, which shows a typical type IV isotherm with a H3 hysteresis loop. The specific surface area displays an increase first and then a descending latter tendency along with the increasing mixing content of CNPs, which is consistent with the following Jsc. The BJH pore size distribution shows an obviously sharp peak located at about 37.60 nm (15%), which once again proves the successful construction of the TiO2 mesoporous film. The pore size distributions are also consistent with the SEM and TEM images shown in Fig. 2. The specific surface area of 20% falls to 75.67 m2 g−1, inducing a decline of the overall photoelectric conversion efficiency because of a loss of active sites for deposition of QDs although it can enable full electrolyte and photoanode contact.

The cell performances with different mixing ratios of CNPs are exhibited in Fig. 5 and the detailed photovoltage parameters such as FF, Jsc, Voc and PCE are listed in Table 2. As exhibited in Table 2 and Fig. 5, the Jsc of the QDSSC based on a mixing ratio of 15% (14.40 mA cm−2) is larger than those of 0%, 10% and 20% (10.87 mA cm−2, 11.34 mA cm−2 and 11.82 mA cm−2). The larger Jsc could be attributed to a higher QD loading of the photoanode (15%) resulting from its higher specific surface area.32 The improved Jsc should also be attributed to a higher diffused reflectance.21 However, Jsc decreases to 11.82 mA cm−2 with the mixing ratio increasing to 20%. This is because when excessive CNPs were removed by thermal treatment, some active sites originally belonging to TiO2 were lost. The Voc (corresponding to 0.58, 0.59, 0.62 and 0.63 V, respectively) shows a continuously rising trend with increasing mixing ratio, which can be attributed to the full contact between electrolyte and photoanode.17 The Voc is related to the electron exchange speed between electrolyte and photoanode. A larger pore size can improve permeation between electrolyte and photoanode leading to a fast electron exchange speed. This is consistent with the variation trend of pore size mentioned above. A thinner TiO2 mesoporous film can lead to the same results. Briefly, all of the above factors lead to a 35.3% enhancement in PCE (from 3.26% to 4.41%). These results are further confirmed by diffused reflectance spectroscopy (Fig. 8) and monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE, Fig. 7). Fig. 6 shows the distribution and variation trend of Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE visually.

To understand the effect of different mixing ratios of CNPs on the QDSSC photoelectrical properties, the light harvesting efficiency of the QDSSCs was investigated by using IPCE curves. As observed in Fig. 7, the absorption wavelength of the QDSSCs co-sensitized by CdS and CdSe locates in the range of 300–680 nm. The QDSSC based on mixing a ratio of 15% shows the highest light absorption intensity and the widest range of light absorption. The enhanced IPCE value is attributed to greater light scattering and higher QD loading, which is the same as the trend of Jsc.33

Since QDSSC efficiency is strongly related to TiO2 mesoporous film light scattering ability, we investigated the effect of the TiO2 mesoporous film constructed by CNPs on the optical properties by using the diffused reflectance spectra. As shown in Fig. 8, the reflectance value of the TiO2 mesoporous film with a mixing ratio of 15% is the most excellent in the range of 350–800 nm due to its larger porosity suggesting that it has the strongest scattering ability.34 This results in enhancing the utilization of solar light in QDSSCs.

Fig. 9 shows the UV-visible absorbance spectra of photoanodes with QDs made from 0%, 10%, 15% and 20% recorded in the range of 350–800 nm. The absorption edge located at about 387 nm can be ascribed to TiO2. The corresponding band gaps of all samples are about 3.2 eV, calculated by using the equation of , where Eg is the wavelength of the absorption edge.33 With increasing CNP content, the absorption edges remain unchanged, indicating that the pore-forming process has no influence on the band gaps and energy levels of TiO2. In general, the pore-forming process can obviously increase the light absorption property of the photoanode. The sample with 15% shows the highest light absorption intensity indicating loading with the maximum number of quantum dots. This is consistent with the variation trend of Jsc and specific surface area. The decreased light absorption intensity of the sample with 20% can be attributed to the reason that when excessive CNPs were removed by thermal treatment, some active sites originally belonging to TiO2 were lost, as shown in Fig. 1(d) (the crack structure).

EIS was performed with an AC amplitude of 10 mV and a frequency range of 0.01–105 Hz under an AM 1.5 solar simulator to investigate the charge transfer kinetics and interior resistance. The detailed Rs, R1, R2 and τr parameters obtained from the fitted Nyquist curves and Bode phase plots using the Z-view software are summarized in Table 3. Rs represents the internal ohmic resistance. The 15% sample shows the smallest Rs (4.52 Ω) indicating that light-generated electrons can pass through the interfacial fluently with least resistance. As shown in Fig. 10(a), two semicircles are observed in the Nyquist diagram of the QDSSCs with the TiO2 mesoporous film constructed by CNPs as photoanodes. In the high frequency region, the first smaller semicircle (R1, 10.97, 7.67, 8.59, and 9.89 Ω) corresponding to the charge transfer resistance at the CuS counter electrode/electrolyte interface shows little difference because of the same counter electrode.35 In the low frequency region, the second larger semicircle (R2, 100.6, 82.68, 55.72, and 75.55 Ω for 0%, 10%, 15% and 20%, respectively) representing the charge transfer resistance at the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte interface indicates that QDSSCs based on a mixing ratio of 15% possess the smallest charge transfer resistance. Before the mixing ratio of CNP reaches 15%, R2 declines from 100.6 Ω to 55.72 Ω. This can be attributed to the fact that pores with suitable diameter are beneficial to the permeation between electrolyte and QDs and effective charge transfer.33 But, R2 increases to 75.55 Ω when the mixing ratio of CNPs reaches 20%. The reason may be that too many crack structures as shown in Fig. 1(d) cause serious charge recombination. The fitted Bode plots are shown in Fig. 10(b). The electron lifetime (τr), which is a significant element to assess the performance of a solar device, is calculated from the following equation: τr = 1/(2πfmax), where fmax represents characteristic frequency at the peak of the middle-frequency range (1–100 Hz).36 QDSSCs based on mixing ratios of 15% show the largest electron lifetime of 283.04 ms. On the whole, with mixing with CNPs, τr was obviously enhanced, indicating that the TiO2 mesoporous film constructed by carbon nanoparticles does extend the electron lifetime to realize enhanced device performance.

The schematic diagram in Fig. 11 shows the pore structure in the TiO2 mesoporous film constructed by CNPs and the transfer mechanism of photo-generated electron–hole pairs in the TiO2/CdS/CdSe photoelectrode. Electron–hole pairs are generated when QDs are excited by photons. Excited electrons are transferred from CdSe and CdS to TiO2 through the conduction band (CB) in descending order. Meanwhile, photo-generated holes are transferred from TiO2 to CdS and CdSe through the valence band (VB) in reverse order, as shown in Fig. 11(b). Photo-generated electrons gather on FTO and act on the external circuit finally. In this process, the structure of the TiO2 film is very important. As shown in Fig. 11(a), pores generated by removal of moderate CNPs (under 15%) can improve permeation between the QD precursor solution and TiO2 film, which is beneficial to the deposition of QDs. Pores generated by removal of the CNPs can also provide more effective active sites for deposition of CdS and CdSe QDs and increase diffused reflectance resulting in a significant increase of light absorption of the photoanode.37 But, when excessive CNPs (20%) were removed by thermal treatment, some active sites originally belonging to TiO2 were lost. Excessive CNPs do harm to the PCE of QDSSCs. In addition, compared with the pure TiO2 particles, TiO2 mesoporous film constructed by CNPs can enable electrolyte and photoanode to contact more fully leading to a smaller interface resistance and rapid diffusion of photo-generated electron–hole pairs.38–40 This leads to the improved PCE of QDSSCs, which is consistent with the characterization of EIS results, diffused reflectance spectra and J–V curve.

4. Conclusion
In summary, a TiO2 mesoporous film constructed by CNPs is prepared by a microwave synthesis, spin-coating and thermal treatment method, and it is applied in QDSSCs. The cell using the TiO2 mesoporous film constructed by CNPs exhibits an enhanced overall PCE in contrast to that of the without-template film. With 15% mixing of CNPs, a champion efficiency of 4.41% with a Voc of 0.62 V, Jsc of 14.40 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.49 is obtained, showing an obvious enhancement of 35.3% in PCE. The improved properties can be attributed to two reasons: (i) pores generated by removal of the CNPs can improve light scattering ability and provide more active sites for deposition of QDs. (ii) Pores generated by removal of the CNPs can enable electrolyte and photoanode to contact more fully leading to smaller interface resistance and rapid diffusion of photo-generated electron–hole pairs.
