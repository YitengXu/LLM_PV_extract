Introduction
Flexible devices for energy conversion and storage are important components of wearable/portable power sources for the next generation.1,2 The combination of flexible energy related devices generates extensive opportunities for the multifunctional units of common hard electronics. In particular, the integration of devices for power generation and electrochemical energy storage is the foundation of self-powered technology, which can power micro-type electronic devices, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and sensors, and integrate them with buildings, tents, clothes, or even the human body.3–5 Thus, novel energy sources with multiple energy conversion modes can change human life.
Electrochemical cells, such as dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),6 supercapacitors,7 and batteries,8,9 are the typical devices used for efficient energy conversion and storage. In principle, these devices are unlimited with respect to the macroscopic properties of substrates (e.g., rigid or flexible and planar or linear) because of the redox reactions that occur at the interface of the functional electrodes and electrolytes. Thus, they generate opportunities for innovative design and special applications.10,11 Flexible, bendable, and stretchable energy devices, such as solar cells, batteries, and supercapacitors, have been developed because of the good prospects and rapid development of material science and micro/nano technology.12,13 Among flexible electronics, fiber shaped electrochemical devices (e.g., wire-based solar cells and supercapacitors),14,15 have attracted particular interest because they avoid transparent conductive oxides, allow inclusive materials and evolve diverse device styles. Furthermore, their scalable and cost effective technology paves the way for practical power sources with promising energy conversion and storage.
Recently, hybrid energy systems have been implemented which can be used for energy conversion and storage, e.g., solar–electric–chemical, mechanical–electric–chemical, and electric–chemical–electric energy conversion.16–18 Nevertheless, flexible rechargeable batteries and flexible solar cells remain a hot topic and are being explored as suitable solar charged modules are not widely available. Flexible lithium batteries have recently been integrated with organic photovoltaic cells.19 However, flexible fiber batteries (FBs) remain challenging to fabricate because of the difficulty of obtaining properly active materials and designing bend resistant electrodes.20 Furthermore, the capacity and life cycle of current FBs must be improved, and their preparation and cost is far from that of consumer power sources.21
Thus, a novel, flexible power source was designed that combines a flexible fiber shaped rechargeable battery and photovoltaic cells. The flexible FB design is based on zinc bromide (ZnBr2) electrochemical reactions and is constructed with simple procedures. The FBs achieve a capacity up to 19 mA h mL−1 and a maximum energy efficiency of 69%. The flexible fiber dye sensitized solar cells (FDSCs) with a high aspect ratio exhibit an efficiency up to 6.12% (11.43% in the diffuse model), and 80% of this original efficiency is retained even after 180 occurrences of bending. The 31.5 cm long device is the longest single FDSC with the highest power output (5.99 mW) ever developed. The hybrid system based on these two kinds of power fibers achieved an overall energy conversion efficiency of 3.42%. The preparations are simple and suitable for large scale production. Thus, this work may pave the way for flexible, lightweight, and efficient power fibers.
Flexible fiber batteries
For the first time, flexible FBs were designed based on the electrode reactions (1) and (2), as well as the shape tolerance of electrochemical cells. Briefly, bromine (Br2) and zinc (Zn) are formed with chemical energy storage during charging and the back reaction for electrical energy output during discharging. Platinum (Pt) was selected as the cathode because it exhibits good catalytic performance to the Br2/Br− couple (ESI Fig. S1†), whereas carbon fiber (CF) has advantages such as good stability, light weight, high specific area, and it is commercially available. As shown in Fig. 1a, the FB contains a Zn strip as anode, a Pt wire (Fig. 1b) or CF (Fig. 1c) as cathode, and ZnBr2 electrolyte in the flexible transparent tube. The two electrodes were separated by a columnar ion exchange membrane for Zn2+ transport. In the flexible battery, only flexible conductive electrodes were involved, which is quite different from typical flexible battery designs. This feature not only simplified the device structure and preparation but also enhanced the flexibility without fragmenting the functional coating layers as occurs in most flexible electrochemical power sources. As the active material and current collecting electrode at the same time, Zn is in excess for the continuous power generation. Thus, the energy capacity of the FB depends on the electrolyte concentration and flexible tube capacity, which leaves room for energy regulation. An inexpensive inorganic salt (ZnBr2) was used as the active material for the Zn2+/Zn and Br2/Br− redox reactions at two electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Furthermore, the aqua electrolyte avoids the use of organic solvents and the corresponding complex packages. The inner electrode for the Br2/Br− redox reaction can prevent Br2 evaporation and package corrosion, thus improving safety and environmental adaptability.

(f) Current responses of fresh devices with Pt and CF cathodes to a linear voltage scan at 0.10 V s−1 at a voltage range of −0.2 to 2.0 V (versus Zn2+/Zn). (g) Nyquist plots of fresh flexible FBs with Pt and CF cathodes. 
Upon charging, the inner layer of the flexible battery gradually turns orange as a result of Br2 formation. Also, random accumulation of Zn nanosheets (Fig. 1d and e) was observed on the surface of the Zn strip, quite different from the original metal surface (ESI Fig. S2†), which further confirm the charged state. This morphology with a large interface area could support large discharges of current. Fig. 1f presents the current responses of fresh devices to a linear voltage. The two peaks correspond to back reactions (1) and (2) and indicate a maximum open circuit voltage of 1.8 V for Pt-based FBs, while the lower value is for CF-based devices. The weaker peak current response of CF-based devices may be caused by the higher resistance of CF cathodes. Nyquist plots (0.1 Hz to 1 MHz) of fresh flexible FBs with Pt and CF cathodes are shown in Fig. 1g. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in the high frequency part shows a low series resistance of 4 Ω for the Pt-based device and 34 Ω for the CF-based device, which is consistent with the previously described phenomena. The responses in the low frequency part indicate different ion diffusion behavior near the Pt and CF cathodes and a more ideal diffusion was observed in the CF device because of its higher surface area contacting the electrolyte compared to the Pt wire of the same weight. Because of the high specific surface area, easy preparation and good catalytic performance, recent successful carbon-based materials and their derivatives may have a role in flexible FBs. Zn2+ + 2e− → Zn, Eo = −0.76 V(1) 2Br− − 2e− → Br2, Eo = 1.07 V(2)
Typical charge–discharge curves of flexible batteries (Zn–Pt) with different current densities are given in Fig. 2a. And the corresponding specific capacity, energy density and power density compared to the device weight, electrolyte volume, length and Pt weight are summarized in Table S1.† When the charge–discharge current density increases from 11.11 to 55.56 mA mL−1, the FB shows stable output voltage plateaus, indicating that it can be used as a reliable constant voltage source. Also, the battery achieves coulomb efficiencies (CEs) of 0.86–0.94, voltage efficiencies (VEs) of 0.80–0.64, and energy efficiencies (EEs) of 0.69–0.60 in the charging–discharging cycles. Nevertheless, the volume capacity reaches 19 mA h mL−1 when the charge–discharge current density is less than 22.22 mA mL−1. When the charge–discharge currents are increased, the residual energy is left over in the batteries as can be seen by the deep color of the inner part. For example, after the charge–discharge cycles with a current of 40 mA (∼40 mA mL−1), the inner layer of the FB remains “orange” and can drive a motor for more than 20 minutes (ESI Fig. S3†). Considering the whole device (3.56 g, 9.00 cm and 0.9 mL), even when the current density reaches 55.56 mA mL−1 (14.04 mA g−1 or 5.56 mA cm−1), the capacity reaches 6.27 mA h mL−1 (1.58 mA h g−1 or 0.63 mA h cm−1) with an energy density of 8.52 mW h mL−1 (2.15 mW h g−1 or 0.85 mW h cm−1) and a power density of 75.54 mW mL−1 (19.09 mW g−1 or 7.55 mW cm−1). Although Pt is used as the electrode, the specific capacity in reference to the Pt weight is 2.67 A h g−1 at 3.13 A g−1, with an Ep of 3.91 W h g−1 and a Pp of 4.57 W g−1, thus indicating that the device could make full use of this precious metal. A good rate performance was observed when the flexible battery was charged–discharged with different current densities (Fig. 2b). The CE varies when the rate changes, but it remains almost constant (∼0.9) when the rate is constant. With a charge–discharge density of 20 mA mL−1, the flexible FB exhibits almost constant capacity and CE for more than 70 cycles (Fig. 2c). The model with two flexible batteries in series can light the LED digital voltmeters after charging. Though the avoidance of using precious Pt metal, the FB with the CF cathode exhibits a stable capacity in 40 charge–discharge cycles with moderate QEs, VEs, and EEs at 10 mA mL−1 (Fig. 2d). The flexible FB with the CF cathode (Zn–CF) can easily drive the motor in bending, twisting, or free standing states because of its high tolerance to shape change (ESI Video I†). This result indicates the potential of FBs as portable/wearable power sources. Furthermore, the capacity of the FB does not change significantly in free standing and bending states (Fig. 2e) and the typical charge–discharge curves are presented in Fig. S4.† For practical considerations, FBs were tested under different temperatures. Satisfactory QEs, VEs, and EEs were achieved in the range of −3 to 40 °C (Fig. 2f), which indicates that FBs can operate at room temperature or lower.

The capacity is limited by the charging time for the 11.11 and 22.22 mA mL−1 groups and by the charging voltage for the 44.44 and 55.56 mA mL−1 groups. (b) Rate capability of the flexible device.

(e) Normalized capacity of FB in free standing and bending states at 20 mA mL−1. Inset: optical images. (f) CE, VE, and EE of FB under different temperatures at 20 mA mL−1. 
Attempts have been made at constructing all CF-based batteries (CF–CF) and these flexible devices were lighter than the Zn–CF devices because of the avoidance of a metal electrode. The basic characterizations of the CF–CF device are provided in Fig. S5.† High series resistance (78 Ω) was observed in the Nyquist plots. Thus, a higher charge voltage was required during charging and a larger voltage drop (up to 0.8 V) was observed to overcome the resistance. Oxygen evolution under a higher charging voltage is a problem for the all CF based FBs. It was also observed that the active Zn layer drops from the CF anode because of poor adhesion, which reduces the quantum efficiency (QE) and limits the cycle performance. Nevertheless, opportunities for further improvement are there for the advanced carbon-based fibers, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and their complex/derivatives.8,21
As listed in Table 1, the FBs based on ZnBr2 chemistry show excellent performance under a high specific charging–discharging current density (J), indicating their special roles in current driven applications. The Zn–Pt and Zn–CF FBs exhibit superior linear capacity, cathode specific capacity and linear energy density compared to those of flexible fiber lithium ion batteries recently reported.20–22 Considering their additional coatings, the nano Zn active layers formed during charging make the preparation easy to handle and to enlarge. Furthermore, the electrode materials involved in this design are stable in air, lightweight and commercially available. All these advantages could contribute to development of practical flexible power sources.

Flexible photovoltaic fibers
Fiber dye sensitized solar cells (FDSCs) are novel dye sensitized mesoporous solar cells fabricated on conductive wires, the use of which has developed rapidly because of their simple fabrication, wide range of material choices, and variable designs.23–26 Efficiencies up to 8% have been claimed for laboratory samples.27–29 Because of the observable differences of typical DSSCs under different voltage scanning directions,30 efficiencies of 8.49% and 6.92% in backward and forward tests for typical FDSC have been achieved (ESI Fig. S6 and Table S2†). To address the problem with efficiency, it is recommended the final current–voltage curve should be the average (7.48%) of the forward and backward tests on FDSCs. To further expand use of FDSCs for portable/wearable applications, ultra-flexible photovoltaic fibers are expected to be developed. Based on the properties of wires, increasing the length/diameter ratio (aspect ratio) improves the flexibility of the FDSCs.
To prepare functional mesoporous layers on the curved fiber surfaces, the titanium dioxide (TiO2) bilayer structure (ESI Fig. S7†) is used. The compact TiO2 layer prepared using sintering of titanium tetraisopropoxide could coarsen the fiber substrate and provide attachment points for the TiO2 nanoparticle layer, which makes the preparation easier and more convenient. In the early attempts, flexible FDSCs based on a TiO2 bilayer structure with an aspect ratio of 90 were prepared. Fig. 3a displays the current–voltage curves with a black background (normal model) and a white paper background (diffuse model). Table 2 summarizes the photovoltaic parameters. The flexible device in the normal model achieves an attraction efficiency of 6.12% with a short circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF) of 12.58 mA cm−2, 0.683 V, and 0.712, respectively. The maximum power output (Pmax) of this large FDSC reaches 1.54 mW, which corresponds to a voltage of 0.530 V and a current of 2.91 mA. The photovoltaic parameters Jsc, FF, and η remain almost constant after rotating the fiber device to modify the illumination area (Fig. 3b), which confirms the formation of uniform functional layers and the property of three-dimensional light collection originated from the symmetrical structure. Given the special property, an apparent energy conversion efficiency of 11.4% is achieved with a peak power (Pmax) of 2.88 mW simply by introducing a sheet of A4 paper as a diffusing base (diffuse model), which represents the effective light collecting capability through back reflection (ESI Fig. S8†). The inexpensive A4 white paper can contribute to the energy collection for flexible photovoltaic fibers. Actual light scattering and reflection comes out of nowhere in the natural environment, thus, the use of a paper background may closely emulate the practical situation and help to optimize the utilization of active materials on the electrode. The FDSC device achieves a specific power (P) of 12.47 mW g−1 according to the weight of the entire device (0.23 g), and P reaches 39.45 mW g−1 based on the weight of the electrode (0.073 g). Thus, the as-prepared flexible FDSCs are highly efficient and lightweight. However, the tube and the electrolyte weigh ∼0.16 g and constitute 68.4% of the total weight and so from this perspective, devices can be lightened further by thinning the tube wall and reducing the amount of electrolyte used.

To determine the device flexibility, the flexible device is tested in the free standing and bending states. Fig. 3c shows the current–voltage curves in both cases under diffuse model. For the free standing state, the flexible fiber solar cell displays Jsc, Voc, FF and η values of 23.21 mA cm−2, 0.723 V, 0.681 and 11.43%, respectively. When the photovoltaic fiber is bent at a radius of approximately 3 cm, η is slightly improved to 11.64% with corresponding Jsc, Voc, and FF values of 24.05 mA cm−2, 0.719 V, and 0.673, respectively. Thus, the flexible FDSC is highly efficient in both states, thereby indicating its unique performance in portable/wearable self-power electronics. The flexible device was recovered and tested after 10 cases of bending. Voc and FF continued to increase slightly during the bending-recovery cycles (Fig. 3d), whereas η decreases slightly and follows almost the same pattern as Jsc measurements. However, 90% of the original efficiency remained after bending 120 times (10.46%) and 80% after bending 180 times (8.98%). The efficiency remained as high as 8.32% even after bending for 200 times in the diffuse model, which was a remarkable performance for flexible solar cells. Cracks were observed on the stretched side of the electrode after bending (Fig. 3e), unlike in the original fiber photoanode (ESI Fig. S9†). The cracks induced by bending allow the electrolyte to penetrate the photoanodes effectively and enhance Voc and FF. However, dislodging the active materials during bending reduces the Jsc and η. This result confirms the advantages of the FB design without additional functional coating layers, which was described previously. To further increase the aspect ratio of the photovoltaic fibers, ultra-long flexible FDSCs with increased active lengths were constructed. Fig. 3f and Table 2 show a typical 31.5 cm long device (aspect ratio > 310) that exhibited a reasonable η and a Pmax of 4.01% and 3.6 mW, respectively; the corresponding values of η and Pmax are 6.68% and 5.99 mW for the diffuse model. These devices are the longest FDSCs ever developed with the highest reported power output to our knowledge.
To demonstrate the reliability of the conventional preparation, 20 ultra-long and flexible FDSCs of about 32 cm long are shown in Fig. 4a. Despite of the impressive length, these photovoltaic fibers have an average weight as light as 0.67 g, which is quite beneficial for portable applications. In addition to the testing under AM 1.5 illumination, the flexible devices were examined under natural sunshine. A single flexible device displays a Voc of 0.76 V (Fig. 4b) and a short-circuit current (Isc) of 8.3 mA (Fig. 4c) under natural afternoon light conditions. The single FDSC exhibits a Voc of 0.80 V (Fig. 5d) and an Isc of 11.4 mA under stronger sunshine at noon (Fig. 5e). The two FDSCs in series reported a reasonable Voc of 1.55 V (Fig. 4f). Video II (ESI†) shows the device flexibility to demonstrate the practicality of using the large FDSCs. Furthermore, a single flexible FDSC can drive a motor outdoors (ESI Video III†). These tests indicate that the flexible solar components can perform excellently in actual environments.
 Fig. 4  (a) Ultra-long flexible FDSCs with active length of ∼32 cm were prepared at an average device weight of ∼0.67 g. The single FDSC had a Voc of 0.76 V (b) and an Isc of 8.3 mA (c) under natural light conditions (∼35.8 mW cm−2, 16:30 on October 15, 2013). The single solar component displays a Voc of 0.80 V (d) and an Isc of 11.4 mA (e) under natural light conditions (∼87.5 mW cm−2, 13:50 on October 16, 2013). (f) Two FDSCs in series generated a Voc of 1.55 V under natural light conditions (∼50.2 mW cm−2, 15:57 on October 21, 2013).

Hybrid energy system
Photovoltaic components can be integrated with rechargeable electrochemical cells to form an efficient hybrid energy system. Considering the solar charging voltage, a series solar module is required for a fiber ZnBr2 battery. A flexible solar device with four FDSCs in series displays an efficiency of 9.32% (ESI Table S3†) with an Isc of 3.93 mA (a Jsc of 4.23 mA cm−2), a Voc of 3.14 V, FF of 0.701, and a P of 2.96 mW g−1. Fig. 5a shows the current–voltage curve, and Fig. 5b presents its steady state current and voltage responses. When connected to the FB, the flexible solar device converts solar energy to electrical power under AM 1.5 illumination and charges the battery which increases the voltage (Fig. 5c) and with a discharge current of 5 mA, the hybrid energy system can output current in the dark or under illumination. Thus, all of the electrical power output originates from solar energy and an overall energy conversion efficiency of 3.42% is achieved. This process converts solar energy to electrical energy, from electrical energy to chemical energy and from chemical energy to electrical energy and the solar energy with a lower power density is finally converted into electrical energy with a higher power density. Compared with some recently reported supercapacitor-based solar-charge systems (as summarized in Table 3), the FDSCs–FB hybrid system achieved a high output voltage and a much longer charging–discharging time scale because of the nature of the ZnBr2 chemistry and the high overall conversion efficiency indicates its promising role for energy conversion and storage. The hybrid energy system that combines FDSCs and FB may be useful in a self-powered system for portable/wearable electronics.

For enhancing the understanding of the electrochemical properties of the hybrid energy system, the impedance amplitude (∣Z∣) with frequency is significant. The electrochemical impedance spectra of the flexible solar cell with four FDSCs in series and the FB are shown in Fig. 5d. The Bode plot of the solar cell indicates the influence of frequency on the reactance impedance of the interface charge behavior. That is, the frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 Hz corresponds to charge recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interfaces, whereas a widened frequency range from 104 Hz to 100 Hz denotes the reduction reaction of the I3−/I− couple at the photocathode/electrolyte interfaces. The knee frequency of the FB is ∼2000 Hz and it corresponds to the time scale for electrode reactions, which is almost similar to that of the reduction reaction of the I3−/I− couple. Given the reaction time scale, charging–discharging through halogen chemistry is a good choice for the hybrid energy system.
To generate practical wearable energy systems, fabric was produced using flexible and lightweight FDSCs on the cloth substrate (Fig. 5e) and a flexible fiber battery was also incorporated into clothes (Fig. 5f). These flexible power fibers can be sewn easily into clothes, backpacks, and tents as power sources for portable equipment, and may pave the way for practical wearable power sources.
Conclusions
In this work, flexible, lightweight, and efficient power fibers, ZnBr2 batteries and DSSCs, based on halogen chemistry were constructed. For the first time, a flexible fiber ZnBr2 battery was prepared using an easy preparation method. This battery displayed a promising maximum volume capacity of 19 mA h mL−1, with a linear capacity density of 1.90 mA h cm−1 and a gravimetric energy density of 4.80 mW h g−1 based on the total weight of the device. The flexible FDSCs (9.0 cm) based on a TiO2 bilayer exhibited a promising energy conversion efficiency of 6.12% (11.4% in the diffuse model). The 31.5 cm long flexible FDSC is the longest ever single FDSC with the highest reported power output. The photovoltaic fibers collected stray light effectively and adapted well under natural light. Furthermore, the rechargeable battery and the fiber photovoltaic cells were integrated for solar–electrical–chemical–electrical energy conversion and maximum overall energy conversion efficiency reached 3.4%. This study may pave the way for flexible, lightweight, and efficient portable/wearable power sources.
Experimental
Fabrication of fiber zinc bromide batteries
All of the FBs were prepared according to the procedure presented in Fig. S10.† The Nafion 117 ion exchange membrane (DuPont, 2 cm × 10 cm) was immersed in a 1.00 M ZnBr2 solution for 12 h. The membrane was then rolled into a cylinder and fixed with a helically wound Zn strip (polished; 0.2–0.3 cm wide). The cylinder was immersed in the original ZnBr2 solution for 24 h and the reaction of Zn and the protons generated bubbles. The Zn surrounded cylinder was placed in a flexible tube (∼10.5 cm) after either a Pt wire or a CF was thrust inside. ZnBr2 solution (2 M, ∼1.0 mL) was injected into the tube and fixed with molten polyethylene. The flexible tube packages had no special requirements, and the heat shrinkable tubes were beneficial for fixing and sealing. The transparent tubes showed visually the color change of the bromine, which reflected the battery capacity. Colorful tubes are also aesthetically pleasing.
Fabrication of FDSCs
All of the fiber photoanodes were prepared according to the procedure34,35 presented in Fig. S11.† A TiO2 compact layer and a nanoparticle layer were typically used to coat clean polished Ti wires. The bilayer electrode was sensitized with N719 dye and twisted with Pt wire. The electrodes were thrust into transparent tubes (outer diameter: 0.1 cm) containing the electrolytes, and the devices were packaged with molten polyethylene. The electrolyte used was an iodine (0.03 M) solution in acetonitrile with 4-tert-butylpyridine (0.5 M), 1,3-diethylimidazolium iodide (0.6 M), lithium perchlorate (LiClO4; 0.1 M), and guanidine thiocyanate (0.1 M). The flexible solar device with four FDSCs in series was fixed onto a sheet of white paper and packaged with Scotch tape.
Measurements
The electrode morphology was detected using a S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi). The solar simulator system (Yamashita Denso) was calibrated using a certified silicon solar cell and the power density (Pin) was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5). The FDSCs were placed on a black stage with/without a sheet of A4 paper. The current–voltage tests on these devices were conducted on a Model 2000 digital multimeter (Keithley Instruments) at room temperature. Each current–voltage curve was the average of a forward (from −0.05 V to 0.80 V) and a backward test (from 0.80 V to −0.05 V) at a voltage step of 0.01 V and a time step of 0.1 s (0.1 V s−1). The illumination area (S) is calculated by multiplying the length with the diameter of the fiber photoanode. To generate reliable test results, the FDSC size parameters are the starting point. The solar energy conversion efficiency was defined as η = Voc × Isc × FF × 100%/(PinS), where Voc, Isc, and FF are open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, and fill factor, respectively. Pmax was computed based on Voc × Isc × FF. Specific power P is expressed by dividing Pmax with either the weight of the entire device or that of the electrode.
The cyclic voltammetry of the Pt wire was tested at 0.10 V s−1 in a solution composed of 1 mM of ZnBr2 and 100 mM of LiClO4 with a Zn plate as the counter electrode and silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) as the reference electrode. The solar charging–discharging experiments were conducted under AM 1.5 illumination. Autolab (Metrohm) was used to record all the charging–discharging voltage signals. Coulomb efficiency (CE) was calculated by the discharging capacity (time) divided by the charging capacity (time); voltage efficiency (VE) was defined as the average discharging voltage divided by the average charging voltage; and energy efficiency (EE) was the product of CE and VE. Qv, Ev, and Pv are the specific capacity, energy density, and power density based on electrolyte volume, respectively. Ql, El, and Pl are the specific capacity, energy density, and power density based on active length, respectively. Qd, Ed, and Pd are the specific capacity, energy density, and power density based on device weight, respectively. QPt, EPt, and EPt are the specific capacity, energy density, and power density based on Pt weight, respectively. Overall energy conversion efficiency is calculated by Eff = Wout/Win × 100% = PinStc/IdVdtd × 100%, where Id is the constant discharge current (5 mA), Vd is the average discharging voltage, and tc and td are the charging and discharging times, respectively. The Bode and Nyquist plots were measured using an Autolab PGSTAT302N (Metrohm) with a 10 mV alternating current amplitude from 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz.
