    , Accepted 5th March 2019First published on 6th March 2019AbstractTwo new molecules, TQT1 and TQT2, and a polymer, PTQT, with a core based on [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline (TQ) with oligoether-substituted phenyl groups as acceptor and thiophene (T) or bithiophene (T2) as donor, were synthesised, characterised, and used in photovoltaic devices. An analogous polymer, PQT, with quinoxaline units (Q) replacing TQ was also synthesised for comparison purposes. The optical band gap decreases in the order: PQT (1.83 eV), TQT1 (1.68 eV), TQT2 (1.31 eV), PTQT (0.78 eV), this being one of the smallest optical band gaps obtained for conjugated polymers. Density functional theory calculations along with solvatochromic studies demonstrated that in TQT1 the conjugation extension brought about by the thiophene rings affects mainly the HOMO orbital, leaving the LUMO localized in the TQ unit. In consequence, HOMO–LUMO excitations have intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character from the thiophene ends to the TQ core and the addition of extra thiophene units (TQT2) induces a decrease in the optical gap. The comparison with the polymer PTQT further elucidates on the role of delocalization extension to the observed shift of the lower energy transitions to the near infrared (NIR) spectral range. All the materials were used as electron-donors in solution-processed bulk heterojunction solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) with PCBM as acceptor and TQT1 was also used as electron-acceptor upon combination with the polymer PTB7, thereby revealing its ambipolar behavior. The spectral response of the cells incorporating the materials with the lowest band gaps extended beyond the longest wavelength of illumination tested (800 nm). The device performances are modest but the open-circuit voltages (VOC) can be well correlated with the optical band gaps.
1. Introduction
Low band gap conjugated polymers and small molecules absorbing in the near-infrared (NIR) region of the spectrum are currently of great interest for organic optoelectronic devices, where the extension of the absorption to longer wavelengths potentially improves performance, as in the case of solar photovoltaics,1–3 or allows for new applications, such as NIR detecting and sensing technologies.4,5 In organic solar cells (OSCs), the optical absorption of the photo-active layer should match the solar spectrum, such that losses in photon absorption are minimized. One of the crucial steps in the development of efficient OSCs was the synthesis of low band gap organic semiconductors as photoactive materials. In effect, most efficient single heterojunction OSCs, demonstrating power-conversion-efficiencies (PCEs) around 13%1,2 are based on a blend of an electron-donor conjugated polymer (known as p-type semiconductor) and an electron-acceptor conjugated small molecule (n-type semiconductor) whose molecular designs consider several key aspects for device optimization, namely a complementary strong absorption in the visible spectrum (350–800 nm). Highly efficient tandem OSCs, developed by the Heliatek company and exhibiting PCEs of 13%, also employ complementary materials, from blue to red absorbers, for the subcells.6 Further extending the absorption of the photoactive layer to the NIR region or at least until where highly efficient single-crystal silicon solar cells (25% in PCE) absorb, i.e., up to 1100 nm, represents a favourable approach to raise the efficiency of OSCs beyond present levels. On the other hand, since the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of OSCs has been shown to scale with the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor semiconductor and the LUMO of the acceptor at their interface,7 narrowing the optical band gaps (Eg) of the absorbers, i.e., by raising the HOMO or lowering the LUMO energy levels, can come at a cost of reduced VOC. Thus, a trade-off between VOC and the photogenerated current within the cell is established for OSCs. To this regard, Janssen et al.8 predicted that, for any bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OSC, the maximum VOC is set by the lowest optical band gap energy (Eg) of either the donor or the acceptor according to the empirical formula: eVOC = Eg − 0.6 eV. To fine-tune the energy band gap and properly engineer the frontier energy levels (HOMO and LUMO) of the photo-active materials for OSCs, a deep understanding on the dependence of the absorption characteristics on the molecular structure is therefore essential. The molecular design of π-conjugated systems consisting of electron donor (D) moieties alternating with electron acceptors (A) has been rather explored to redshift the absorption, provided that lower-energy charge-transfer-type optical transitions are likely. In addition, the planarization of part of the conjugated backbone, e.g. by using fused π-conjugated building blocks, has also resulted in reduced band gaps. Remarkably, the most efficient single heterojunction OSCs reported to date (PCEs of 12–13%) employ, as acceptor, small molecules with the A–D–A molecular design-type where D is based on fused rings and A is a dicyanomethylene-indanone or a difluorinated analogous (ITIC and IT-4F, respectively), with absorption maxima at 700 (ITIC) and 717 nm (IT-4F). In these cases, the external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of the cells reach their maxima for illuminations within 500–750 nm range.1,2 The insertion of donor and acceptor moieties in the conjugated backbone can also result in materials combining low ionisation potentials and high electron affinities thereby facilitating charge injection of both signs (electrons and holes), i.e. ambipolar charge transport. For example, PBDTTQ-2, a conjugated polymer composed of the acceptor unit benzodithiophene–thiadiazoloquinoxaline (BDTTQ) alternating with bithiophene (donor) exhibits Eg of 1.03 eV and ambipolar charge transport in FETs with mobilities of 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 (V s)−1 for holes and 6.0 × 10−4 cm2 (V s)−1 for electrons. The ambipolar behaviour was interpreted as result of the good electronic delocalization of the HOMO and the LUMO over the conjugated repeat unit.9 To date, only a few semiconducting polymers and small molecules have been reported with high absorption extending to the NIR1,2,9–15 (Eg inferior or approaching to 1.1 eV). Keshtov and co-workers10 synthesised two polymers with structure of type D–A1–D–A2, where D moieties are thiophene rings and A1 and A2 are, respectively, benzothiadiazole (BT) and thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline (TQ) blocks, exhibiting strong absorption in the 300–1100 nm range (Egca. 1.1 eV). PV cells based on these new polymers blended with PCBM as acceptor showed VOC of 0.7–0.8 V and PCEs between 3 and 4%. Donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers containing N-substituted-dithieno-pyrrole as donor and TQ or benzobisthiadiazole (BBT) as acceptors, with optical gaps lower than 1.0 eV, were reported by Marder and co-workers.11 The polymer with BBT as the acceptor exhibited Eg of 0.56 eV but the performance of cells with PCBM was the poorest, showing negligible PCEs and VOC of ca. 0.1 V. Nevertheless, ambipolar field-effect (FET) characteristics, with mobilities of 1.6 × 10−3 cm2 (V s)−1 (for holes) and 7.9 × 10−4 cm2 (V s)−1 (for electrons) and electrochromism at moderate potentials was shown for such polymer. Hole and electron mobilities of similar magnitude were also measured in FETs for a D–A copolymer based on a TQ moiety alternating with an alkylsubstituted thiophene tetramer, which exhibited an Eg of 1.03 eV.9 Interestingly, a polymer composed of the same building blocks but where the TQ moiety is anchored to the polymer chains instead of being alternated with the thiophene-based blocks did not show any field-effect response.9 Other D–A polymers composed of either a BBT or a TQ acceptor alternated with a dialkylfluorene donor unit also showed absorption at wavelengths longer than 1000 nm.12 In these systems, the acceptor unit BBT caused low solubility of the resulting polymer due to the lack of functionalization sites and drastically affected devices’ performance. Andersson et al.15 also reported on two D–A-type copolymers with either a thiophene unit or a terthiophene-based donor moiety alternating with a pyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline (whose electron-acceptor character is in between BBT and TQ units) with absorption onsets at wavelengths longer than 1000 nm but whose OSCs, with PC71BM as the acceptor, showed low efficiencies, in the 0.3–2.1% range. Despite the interest of ultra-narrow band gap polymers for PV cells or other kind of devices, the origin of the absorption in the long-wavelength region has not been thoroughly assessed, being typically referred as related to intramolecular charge transfer between the donor and acceptor moieties.
Here, we present the synthesis, the optical and electrochemical properties, and applications in OSCs, of three new low band gap absorbers with Eg ranging from 1.68 eV to 0.78 eV and of a related larger band gap absorber (Eg = 1.83 eV), for comparison purposes. Our study focuses on theoretical quantum mechanical calculations and photophysical studies to unravel the structural features that are at the origin of the optical-NIR transitions on such systems. The new low band gap materials include two small molecules and one polymer, composed of covalently linked donor and acceptor moieties, these being, respectively, thiophene or bithiophene, and thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline functionalized with phenyl rings substituted with oligo(ethylene oxide) (EO) groups (Scheme 1). The incorporation of EO-type solubilizing chains aims at their solution processing using hydrophilic solvents such as water or ethanol, i.e. environmentally friendly solvents, to enable a “greener” device fabrication. We consider that the obtained results provide guiding principles for the molecular design of NIR absorbers for applications in optoelectronic devices.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis
The three thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline derivatives TQT1, TQT2 and PTQT and the quinoxaline derivative polymer PQT were designed with phenyl rings substituted with ethylene-oxide-based solubilizing chains aiming at accomplishing solubility in solvents of low toxicity as alcohols or glycol ethers. Given that the larger chain size of the polymers is expected to reduce solubility, the two polymers were synthesised with disubstituted phenyl rings. The four new materials were obtained in good yields by Stille cross coupling reactions between the appropriate dibrominated quinoxaline derivatives (6, 7 and 11) and thienyl-based alkylstannanes (Scheme 2). The synthetic strategies used to prepare the monomeric units for obtaining TQT1, TQT2, PTQT, and PQT are depicted in Scheme 2. These followed common approaches used to prepare TQ derivatives with slight modifications. After purification from lower molecular weight fractions, possible palladium residues were removed by liquid–liquid extraction with a sodium diethyldithiocarbamate dihydrate solution. TQT1 and TQT2 were thoroughly purified by preparative thin-layer chromatography. The new monomers and the final products were fully characterised by elemental analysis, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR (see Experimental section and ESI†) and the molecular weight distributions of the two polymers were determined by size exclusion chromatography against polystyrene standards in THF. TQT1 and TQT2 were obtained in good yields (ca. 77%). The two polymers were obtained in good yields (58% for PTQT and 84% for PQT) with moderate molecular weight (Mn = 9400 Da, Mw = 19400 Da for PTQT and Mn = 15900 Da, Mw = 35800 Da for PQT). Although they were dried at 40 °C for 12 hours under dynamic vacuum, the elemental analysis of the two polymers suggested some water coordinated to the samples. This can be justified by the hydrophilic character of the EO solubilizing groups. In the case of TQT1 and TQT2, their purification method, through chromotography on SiO2 plates, showed to be very effective on drying the compounds, as no weighty deviations on the analysis were found. The lower molecular weight and polymerization yield found for the PTQT polymer are likely due to larger steric hindrance caused by the substitution of the heterocycle monomer 6 with the thiadiazole moiety. Noteworthy, all the final products exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents (e.g. dichloromethane, toluene, etc.) and moderate solubility in some hydrophilic solvents such as ethanol (ca. 10 mg mL−1).

2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical properties of the new materials were investigated in diluted solutions in various solvents of different polarities and in thin films prepared by spin-coating from 10 mg mL−1 solutions. Electrochemical characterisation consisted on cyclic voltammetry measurements performed on a three-electrode set-up within a TBABF4/acetonitrile supporting electrolyte (see Experimental section for details). The measured onset of redox processes was used to estimate the HOMO and LUMO energies, after referring to the vacuum level. TQT2 and PTQT were measured in drop cast film deposited on top of the Pt disc working electrode, whereas TQT1 and PQT were measured in solution, in the supporting electrolyte, due to their solubility in acetonitrile and all the solvents tested for electrolytes. Fig. 1 shows the measured UV-Visible-NIR absorption spectra in solution (CH2Cl2) and in spin cast films prepared from concentrated solutions of TQT1, TQT2, PTQT, and PQT and the spectra calculated as described in the following section. Table 1 summarizes the optical and electrochemical data.

The absorption spectra of TQT1 and TQT2 show bands at long wavelengths, with the absorption of TQT2 being significantly shifted towards lower energies. This redshift corresponds to a reduction of the optical band gap from 1.68 eV (for TQT1) to 1.31 eV (for TQT2), and establishes TQT2 among the small molecules based on quinoxaline-based conjugated cores with the narrowest optical band gaps. Deng et al.16 synthesised a series of four quinoxaline-based small molecules with π-conjugated systems formed by the insertion of alkylthiophene or carbazole on both sides of the molecular backbone whose Eg ranged from 2.09 to 1.77 eV. Lower optical band gaps, down to ca. 1.12 eV, were achieved by Cunbin An et al.9 for comonomers composed of benzodithiophene–thiadiazoloquinoxaline (BDTTQ) units coupled to fused thiophene rings. As shown in Fig. 1, the lowest energy band of PTQT is further redshifted, suggesting a more extended π-system conjugation. The structural modifications along the series TQT1, TQT2 and PTQT also lead to significant changes in the emissive properties, with TQT2 exhibiting redshifted emission compared to TQT1. PTQT did not show emission in a broad range of solvents, which is attributed to the very small energy gap between excited and ground state, according to the energy gap law. The insertion of one thienyl unit at each end of TQT1 raised both HOMO and LUMO energies, especially in the HOMO level, whose energy raises from −5.24 eV to −4.81 eV (for TQT2), whereas the LUMO energy is raised by only 0.15 eV if determined from the cathodic scan in CV or 0.06 eV if determined as the sum of Eg to the HOMO energy. Thus, it can be concluded that the decrease of Eg from TQT1 to TQT2 is mostly due to an increase of the HOMO energy. This tendency continues when going to the polymer PTQT, which has the highest HOMO energy (−4.55 eV) of the series. In fact, the difference in the HOMO energy of PTQT and that of the related monomer (TQT1), being 0.69 eV, is even larger that the corresponding decrease of the optical band gap (0.53 eV). Close values (0.64 eV and 0.71 eV) for the optical band gap were also reported by Steckler et al.17 for two polymers with analogous conjugated core but with a different substitution pattern in the phenyl rings (one octyldodecyloxy group in each phenyl ring). PQT exhibits significantly blue shifted absorption and emission spectra when comparing with PTQT, corresponding to a much larger Eg for PQT (1.83 eV). Looking at the HOMO and LUMO energies, the larger Eg of PQT is a result of a significant raise in the LUMO energy. This can be attributed to the lower electron-accepting character of the quinoxaline-based unit in comparison with the thiadiazolo-quinoxaline-based unit, since the LUMO is spread over to the thiadiazole units as shown by the quantum mechanical calculations discussed in the next section. Since the medium polarity can affect the energy of ground and excited states, especially for transitions with charge transfer character, the absorption and emission spectra of the new compounds were also recorded in solvents with a wide range of polarities (Fig. 2).

Compounds TQT1 and TQT2 exhibit only small changes in the absorption spectra in different solvents, but almost no variations in their emission spectra. However, there is a clear correlation between solvent polarity and the Stokes shift for these compounds (Fig. S24 of ESI†), suggesting that the lowest energy transition has a charge transfer character. This behavior is not displayed by compound PTQ, i.e., despite more significant changes in absorption and emission spectra, there is not a clear correlation between Stokes shift and solvent polarity (Fig. S24 of ESI†), suggesting that an ICT transition does not occur due to the absence of the thiadiazole moiety. The polymer PTQT evidences the most significant changes in the absorption spectra in different solvents. However, emission from PTQT could not detected, due to the very small energy gap between excited and ground state; thus the occurrence of ICT could not be investigated further through optical spectroscopy.
2.3. Quantum mechanical calculations
To further understand the correlation between structural modifications of the new compounds and their photophysical properties, density functional theory (DFT) calculations carried out using GAMESS-US18 version R3 were performed. A range corrected CAMB3LYP19 functional, with 65% HF exact exchange at long range and 19% at short range was used in both ground- and excited-state calculations. TDDFT calculations, with similar functionals, were used to compute the excitations from the ground state wavefunction. A 6-31G** basis set was used in either DFT or TDDFT calculations. DFT energy calculations and optimizations as well as TDDFT excitations were carried out in model compounds with methoxy groups as solubilizing chains. To assess the effect of such simplifications in the molecular structures, additional calculations were performed for TQT1 with fully modelled oligoether chains. As the simulated absorption spectra was found to be blue-shifted by only 0.02 eV in relation to that determined for the compound with oligoether chains, all the compounds were studied with methoxy groups. The polymers PTQT and PQT were modelled as H-end capped dimers. To check that the dimer mimics well the conjugated length, PQT was also modelled as a trimer, for which deviations in the computed spectra were less than 0.05 eV. In addition, the derivative chromophore without end-capped thiophenes, i.e., 6,7-(bis(methoxy)phenyl)-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline (designated by TQref) (not synthesised) was also studied to provide a reference system for the effect of thiophene in the diphenyl-thiadiazolo-quinoxaline skeleton. The HOMO and LUMO energies were calculated as explained in the Experimental section. Fig. 3 depicts drawings of the relevant frontier molecular orbitals determined by DFT. The DFT calculated structures were also used in TDDFT calculations aiming at predicting and rationalizing the optical properties of the compounds. The obtained values for the maximum transitions are shown in Table 1 and the simulated spectra are shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Frontier molecular orbitals of modelled compounds determined from DFT optimized geometries (n = 1, m = 3 for TQT1; n = 2, m = 1 for TQT2). 
The calculated HOMO and LUMO energies, as shown in Table 1, are in good agreement with the experimental values. Also, the calculated spectral values are relatively close to the experimental ones obtained in CH2Cl2 solutions. For TQref the calculations yielded two main absorptions: (i) a π–π* (HOMO–LUMO) charge transfer from the phenoxide rings to the thiadiazolo-quinoxaline core at 376 nm, and (ii) a higher energy π–π* excitation at 245 nm (spectrum not shown). In comparison, as concluded from Fig. 3, the introduction of one thiophene unit at each side of TQref (TQT1), causes a new lower energy band, at around 614 nm. This new band corresponds to the HOMO–LUMO excitation with a low ICT character from the thiophenes to the thiadiazolo-quinoxaline block, as depicted in Fig. 3. In comparison with TQref, the addition of the thiophene ring enables the HOMO to extend the delocalization while the LUMO remains essentially unchanged. This is consistent with both experimental and calculated values with a ΔHOMO = −0.43 eV and a ΔLUMO = −0.15 eV. The negative sign of the difference is compatible with the anti-bonding nature of the extra interaction. Similarly to TQT1, for TQT2 a new ICT band appears in comparison with TQref, but at larger wavelengths (714 nm), which is due to a rise in the HOMO energy due to a further delocalization to the bithiophene end capping units. These results are in accordance with the photophysical studies showing a correlation between the Stokes shift and the medium polarity for TQT1 and TQT2 and therefore indicating an ICT character for the HOMO–LUMO transitions. For the PTQT polymer (modelled as dimer), the calculations showed that the HOMO energy is further raised, to −4.63 eV, which is attributed to the larger extension of the π-system, whereas the LUMO energy (calculated by adding the energy transition maxima to the HOMO energy – see Experimental section in ESI,† for details) remains essentially unaltered. The similarity in LUMO energies found for TQT1, TQT2 and PTQT can be attributed to the strong localization of this orbital over the central thiadiazolo-quinoxaline unit. Comparing PTQT and PQT polymers, for PQT, the calculated HOMO energy is not significantly altered, as also determined by the CV measurements, owing to the spread of the HOMO through essentially the same atoms. However, the LUMO is less stabilized and considerably rises in energy (therefore causing the observed larger optical band gap) due to the absence of the thiadiazole unit coupled to the quinoxaline core, which contributes to the LUMO in PTQT and stabilizes it. Thus, the HOMO–LUMO excitation in PQT is more a locally excited (LE) transition, since both HOMO and LUMO are distributed essentially through the same system in the chromophore, while in PTQT the LUMO is also spread to the thiadiazole unit and the HOMO–LUMO transition has more ICT character. Thus, the absence of a correlation between the Stokes shift and the solvent polarity found for PQT can be due to the lack of ICT character of the HOMO–LUMO transition. In conclusion, these results show that the presence of the thiadiazole unit coupled to the quinoxaline core and the extension of the π-system from TQT1 to that of the dimer of PTQT are key structural features to lower the LUMO and raise the HOMO energies, respectively, causing the observed transitions at the NIR range.
2.4. Photovoltaic devices
The new materials were used in the active layer of solution-processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells fabricated with the general structure: glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al (or with Ca/Al as top electrode) (see Experimental section for details). The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of the new materials in solar cells without fully exploiting device optimization. All the materials were tested as electron-donors in blends with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) or with the C71 analogue, PC70BM. The blends were spin coated from chlorobenzene (or chloroform, in the case of the PQT:PC60BM mixture) (see Experimental section for details) and with various D:A ratios (by weight). The UV-Visible absorption spectra of the blends and of the pure compounds in the solvent used for the respective blends are shown in Fig. S25 of ESI.†TQT1 was also tested as electron-acceptor in blends with poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7), whose HOMO and LUMO levels are −5.15 eV and −3.31 eV, respectively.20 Conversely, the high HOMO energies found for TQT2, PTQT, and PQT (all above −4.81 eV) precluded their exploration as acceptors, since we could not find a donor with HOMO and LUMO levels suitable for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer. The variation of the cells parameters with the D:A ratio for the blends of TQT1 and TQT2 with PC70BM is shown in Table S1 of ESI† (study performed with Pin of 82 mW cm−2). The performance parameters determined under solar simulated irradiation (AM 1.5G) at 100 mW cm−2 of the best devices for each D:A pair are collected in Table 2. The corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) in the 350–800 nm range of illumination are shown in Fig. 4 and 5, respectively. The corresponding dark curves and the data for the remaining cells are shown in Fig. S26–S28 and Table S1 and of ESI.† The overall performance of the cells is modest, reaching a maximum of 1.20% for the TQT1:PC70BM (1:3) blend. For this case, as well as for the other cells with TQT1, the EQE spectrum extends up to 800 nm indicating that excitons formed in the TQT1 phase contribute to charge generation. As observed, the VOC for the series with TQT1 as donor is high, varying between 0.83 and 0.88 V. Variances of the HOMO and LUMO energies of the donor and/or the acceptor at their interface due to polarization effects may be at the origin of the different VOC observed for distinct D:A ratio. The Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) analysis (topography images) of the blend films for TQT1:PC60BM and the TQT1:PC70BM series reveals rather smooth surfaces, without noticeable differences, as shown in Fig. 6.

The ambipolar behaviour of TQT1 is revealed by the response of PTB7:TQT1 blends (where TQT1 acts as electron-acceptor), yielding a high VOC, of 0.93 V. TQT2:PCBM blends show similar PCE values, although a little lower, reaching a maximum value of 0.80% for the TQT2:PC70BM 1:3 case. In comparison with TQT1:PC70BM blends, films with TQT2 are slightly less smoother (higher surface roughness, rms) as shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. S30 of ESI.† The VOC values for the TQT2 series are lower than those for TQT1-based cells, as expected, considering that VOC is directly related with the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor7 and since the HOMO level energy increases by 0.43 eV from TQT1 to TQT2. The EQE spectra of the cells with TQT2 shows an important intensity at the largest wavelength of excitation that could be probed (800 nm), this meaning that the response of these cells extends beyond that edge, probably following the shape of the lower energy absorption band of TQT2. Going to the cells with PTQT, a further decrease in VOC occurs, again, as expected, given the raise in the HOMO energy, to −4.55 eV (CV measurements). Noteworthy, considering the very small Eg of PTQT, of 0.78 eV, the obtained VOC for PTQT:PC70BM, being 0.27 V, surpasses the maximum predicted by the aforementioned empirical relation of Jansen et al. stating that in BHJ active layers, the maximum VOC is set by eVOC = Eg − 0.6 eV, where Eg refers to the smallest optical band gap of either the donor or the acceptor.8 The AFM images of PTQT:PC70BM films show well-defined round-shaped elevated domains of considerable size (around 100–200 nm). Such morphology indicates a prominent phase separation of the two components, which is likely to cause excitons loss due to their non-accessibility of donor:acceptor interfaces. Such segregation can therefore be at the origin of the low current generated by these devices. An analogous film morphology is also found for PQT:PC60BM blends. These findings suggest that the performance of the devices with PTQT and PQT may be improved if other acceptors are used (non-fullerenes) and/or by implementing strategies to optimize the blends’ morphology. The distinct chemical nature (hydrophilic) of the solubilizing chains of the new materials with respect to those of the fullerenes used in this study and of PTB7 are likely to cause intermolecular organization characteristics at a small scale which are adverse for exciton dissociation and charge transport. These features may be at the origin of the poor performances of the cells, especially in the cases with PTQT and PQT, due to incorporating a higher number of ethylene-oxide groups. Furthermore, the solvents used in this study may be inadequate for the new materials (although good solubility was reached), since they were chosen accordingly with the solubility of the fullerene acceptors or PTB7, whose solubilizing chains are of distinct nature. Further studies with the new materials in donor:acceptor pairs where both have solubilizing chains of analogous chemical nature are in progress.
3. Experimental section
3.1. Material and methods
All the reactions were carried out under inert atmosphere using a dual vacuum/nitrogen line unless otherwise specified. All the solvents used under inert atmosphere were dried by refluxing over a suitable drying agent followed by distillation under N2 and degassed by the freeze–pump–thaw method. Unless otherwise stated, all the reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used as received. NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Bruker “Advance II” spectrometer (300 or 400 MHz). Elemental analyses were obtained from the IST elemental analysis services. High resolution ESI positive mode mass spectra were obtained on a QqTOF Impact II™ mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) operating in the high resolution mode. Molecular weight distributions of the two polymers were obtained by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in a Waters 1515 chromatograph with three Styragel columns (HR5E, HR4, HR3) in series and with a Waters 2414 differential refractometer. Monodisperse polystyrenes in THF were used as standards. All the analyses were performed on filtered solutions (0.2 μm, Millipore Millex HV). The compounds 1,212,224,235,24,25926 and 1327 were prepared following reported procedures. All the solvents used in spectroscopic and electrochemistry methods were of HPLC grade.

3.2. Optical measurements
UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded in a Cecil 7200 spectrophotometer or in a Cary 100 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Horiba SPEX 212 I Fluorolog Spectrofluorimeter. All emission spectra were collected with 2 nm slit bandwidth for excitation and emission, with correction files. Optical band gaps were calculated from the UV-Vis absorption onset of the UV-Vis absorption at larger wavelengths for spin cast films prepared from concentrated solutions (10 mg mL−1).
3.3. Electrochemical measurements
Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed using a Solartron potentiostat and a three electrode set-up equipped with a platinum wire as counter electrode and a platinum disk as working electrode and a saturated calomel electrode or Ag/AgCl reference electrode as reference electrode, immersed in tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate solution in acetonitrile (0.1 M) as supporting electrolyte. The voltammograms were obtained at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple was used as external reference. When insoluble, the samples were drop cast from THF solutions onto the working electrode, otherwise they were dissolved in the electrolyte. HOMO and LUMO levels estimated from CV measurements were calculated from the onset values found for the oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively, after referring to the vacuum level and considering the energy level of Fc/Fc+ as 4.80 eV below the vacuum level. Thus, the following equations were used: EHOMO (eV) = −(Eox,onset (vs. Fc/Fc+) + 4.80) and ELUMO (eV) = −(Ered,onset (vs. Fc/Fc+) + 4.80).
3.4. DFT/TDDFT calculations
A 6-31G** basis set was used in either DFT or TDDFT calculations. CAMB3LYP slightly overestimates excitations with a scaling scheme applied to the reported values (Ereported = ETDDFT × 0.98 − 0.06) (Ereported = ETDDFT × 0.92 − 0.25).28,29 The PBE0 functional was used for the estimates of the HOMO energies of all compounds. This choice resulted from a comparative study performed for the HOMO of TQT1 where different amounts of exact exchange, implied by the functional choice, and ranging from 0 in pure DFT to 100% in Hartree Fock with intermediate values with hybrid methodologies, where PBE0 was found to give the best predictions (see Fig. S25 in ESI†). Given the difficulty in obtaining accurate estimates for the LUMO energies, owing to the fact that the HF limit always predicts a 0 eV value for the LUMO, and considering that the Kohn–Sham HOMO–LUMO difference is a good estimation of the excitation energy, the LUMO energies were determined as ELUMO = EHOMO + Eexcitation where Eexcitation was calculated within the TDDFT framework.
3.5. OSCs device fabrication and characterisation
Solar cells were fabricated over glass/ITO (ITO: indium-tin-oxide) previously cleaned by successive washes with distilled water and a non-ionic detergent, distilled water, acetone (HPLC grade), and isopropyl alcohol (HPLC grade) under ultrasounds. They were then subjected to UV-oxygen plasma for 3 minutes before depositing a thin layer (ca. 40 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene:polystyrene sulfonic acid)) by spin coating from an aqueous dispersion (Heraeus Clevios PVP.Al 4083). The glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates were then dried at 125 °C for 10 min under air and the active blends were spin-coated on top. Blend solutions with TQT1, TQT2 and PTQT were prepared with concentrations of 30 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene and blends of PQT were prepared with concentration of 15 mg mL−1 in chloroform. All the blend solutions were stirred on a hot plate at ca. 100 °C (solutions in chlorobenzene) or ca. 50 °C (solutions in chloroform) overnight. In the case of devices with PTB7, the blend solutions were prepared with a concentration of 30 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene and stirred for 3 hours at 75 °C. The blend solutions were spin coated on ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates in a nitrogen-filled glove box. 20 nm of calcium (devices with Ca/Al electrodes) or 1.5 nm of LiF (devices with LiF/Al) followed by 60/100 nm of aluminum were then evaporated on top at a base pressure below 2 × 10−6 mbar, through a shadow mask. The device active area is of 0.24 cm2. At least 16 devices were prepared for each condition. Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the photovoltaic devices were measured under inert atmosphere (N2). PCEs were calculated using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A, 69920, Newport) with simulated AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 or at 82 mW cm−2, as indicated. The light intensity was measured with a calibrated solar cell. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were obtained under short-circuit conditions, using a homemade system with a Xe lamp as light source.
3.6. AFM analysis
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed on a Nano Observer microscope from Concept Scientific Instruments (Les Ulis, France), operating in noncontact mode. Cantilevers with a resonance frequency between 200 and 400 kHz and silicon probes with tip radius smaller than 10 nm were used. All images were taken with 256 × 256 pixels resolution and processed with Gwyddion (version 2.26) software.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, two new small molecules and one polymer incorporating a [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4]quinoxaline unit and thiophene rings and with hydrophilic solubilizing chains with absorption at low energies were synthesised. The optical band gap in the series of the new compounds decreases up to 0.78 eV, this value being found for the polymer consisting of [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4]quinoxaline blocks alternated with thiophene units. Quantum mechanical calculations supported by solvatochromic studies enabled to assign the UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of the new compounds and allowed to conclude that HOMO–LUMO excitations have intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character from the conjugated chain including the thiophene units to the [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4]quinoxaline core and that π-delocalization extension up to dimer compounds causes a red-shift of the lower energy transitions to the near infrared (NIR) spectral range. The comparison with an analogous polymer without thiadiazole units coupled to quinoxaline groups evidenced the role of thiadiazole moiety on the ICT character of the HOMO–LUMO transitions. Solution-processed bulk heterojunction solar cells with the compounds exhibiting the narrowest band gaps showed response beyond the largest wavelength of illumination tested (800 nm) and one material, TQT1, was also used as electron-acceptor, thereby revealing its ambipolar behavior. The open-circuit voltages of the cells were well related with the optical band gaps of the new compounds. The performance of the cells was low, but it should be partly attributed to unfavorable morphology due to the incompatibility between solubilizing chains of the donor and acceptor in the active blends. This work contributes to the understanding of structure–properties-applications in PV devices relationships of organic NIR absorbing systems.
