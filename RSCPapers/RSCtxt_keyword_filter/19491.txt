    , Accepted 2nd October 2012First published on 2nd October 2012AbstractIn this study, we present a facile hydrothermal synthesis of ultrasmall delafossite CuCrO2 nanocrystals, with a typical size of 15 nm × 5 nm, and a high surface area of 87.86 m2 g−1, thermally stable up to 400 °C. The screen-printed CuCrO2 films sintered at different temperatures and under different atmospheres present different optical transmittances, tunable BET surface areas, dye adsorbing amounts, and tunable hole transport rates and hole recombination kinetics, which allows the optimization of the performance of p-type dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on CuCrO2 photocathodes. At optimized conditions, an open circuit voltage of 102 mV, a short circuit density of 0.491 mA cm−2, a fill factor of 0.398 and an overall photoconversion efficiency of 0.0194% were finally achieved for a coumarin 343 dye sensitized CuCrO2 solar cell. This record is acceptably high in comparison to a DSSC based on an NiO photocathode prepared and tested in similar experimental conditions. The light harvesting properties, charge collection capability, and flat-band potential of CuCrO2 photocathodes and the NiO photocathode have been critically compared.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been regarded as among the most promising third generation photovoltaic devices. Their ecological and low-cost fabrication processes make them an attractive and credible alternative to conventional photovoltaic systems. In the past decades, much of the research had been focused on the sensitization of n-type semiconductors, such as TiO2, ZnO or SnO2.1–3 The world record efficiency of such n-type DSSCs has recently been improved, and is as high as 12.3%.2 Comparatively, few studies were focused on p-type semiconductor based DSSCs, called p-type DSSCs, and the reported efficiencies were much lower than those of their n-type counterparts. The inherent causes should be attributed to the lack of choice of p-type semiconductors and organic sensitizers suitable for them. The working mechanism regarding kinetic competition for the interfacial processes in p-type DSSC also needs to be further elucidated.1
The photocathode for p-type DSSCs should be required to have some special features: wide band gap, large surface area, high surface chemical affinity, suitable valence band potential and suitably high hole mobility.2,3 NiO has been the most frequently reported p-type photocathode material in the past.4–10 Although it is chemically stable, and has a wide direct band gap, its drawbacks are also evident. The biggest issue should be assigned to the potential offset between the valence band edge of NiO and the redox potential of an iodine based electrolyte being too small, leading to the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the corresponding p-type DSSC being too small. The second problem might be the d–d electron transition induced light absorption of the NiO film, which is visible with a dark green color, hindering the light harvesting by the dye. Recently promoted delafossite ABO2 materials, including CuAlO2 (ref. 11 and 12) and CuGaO2,13,14 which belong to an important family of transparent conducting oxides, feature excellent optical transparency in the visible range and high electrical conductivity, and are demonstrated to be a very promising alternative to NiO in p-type DSSCs. The Voc of the reported cells based on ABO2 p-type semiconductors has been proved to be 50–150 mV higher than that with the NiO base, which is associated with their deeper valance band edge positions;11–14 however, their short circuit densities (Jsc) were still too low, restricted by the new materials' low surface areas and therefore limited amounts of dye adsorption. Therefore, it is crucial to explore further the synthesis of delafossite ABO2 materials with small enough sizes and the suitable features of their application in p-type DSSCs.
In this work, we report a facile hydrothermal synthesis of delafossite CuCrO2 nanocrystals, with the smallest size ever reported, and for the first time the application of them as photocathodes in p-type DSSCs. CuCrO2 was chosen in place of NiO for the following reasons: (1) for bulk CuCrO2,15–17 the reported direct optical band gap is as large as 2.95–3.30 eV; (2) the CuCrO2 film deposited by sputtering has been reported with high electrical conductivity up to 1.0 S cm−1.18 Indeed, by using coumarin 343 dye and I3−/I− electrolyte, p-type DSSCs based on CuCrO2 nanocrystals achieved a high Jsc of about 0.491 mA cm−2, Voc of 102 mV, fill factor of 0.398 and efficiency (η) of 0.0194%. The performance is ∼20% higher than that of NiO based DSSCs prepared and tested in similar experimental conditions, and is comparable to the recently reported CuGaO2 nanoplate based DSSCs,13,14 but has a much higher Jsc than that of CuGaO2 or CuAlO2 based DSSCs due to the high surface area of CuCrO2,11,12 though CuGaO2 and CuAlO2 were sensitized with dyes that are several times more efficient (P1, PMI-NDI and PMI-6T-TPA).
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of CuCrO2 nanocrystals
All chemical reagents in this experiment were of analytical grade and were purchased and used without further purification. Typically, 15 mmol Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and 15 mmol Cu(NO3)2·3H2O were dissolved in 70 ml deionized water with magnetic stirring, followed by the addition of 5.0 g NaOH as a mineralizer. The obtained solution was transferred into a 100 ml Teflon-lined autoclave, which was sealed and maintained at 240 °C for 60 h. Then, the obtained dark green precipitate was washed with diluted hydrochloric acid and absolute alcohol in sequence several times, and was finally stored in absolute alcohol solution for further use. It is notable that this method produces a high yield of the CuCrO2 nanosized product, about 2.2 g per reaction.
2.2 Preparation of CuCrO2 films and DSSCs
The CuCrO2 paste for screen-printing was prepared according to the literature.19 Two kinds of ethyl cellulose (EC) powders, i.e., EC (5–15 mPa s) and EC (30–60 mPa s) were dissolved prior to usage in ethanol to yield 10 wt% solutions. 5.6 g of EC (5–15 mPa s) solution and 4.4 g of EC (30–60 mPa s) solution were added to a round bottomed rotavap flask containing 2.0 g pure CuCrO2 nanocrystals and 10.0 g terpineol, and diluted with 50 ml of ethanol to obtain a final total volume of 80 ml. This mixture was then ultrasonicated to make it homogeneous by using an ultrasonic horn for several minutes. Ethanol was removed from the CuCrO2–ethyl cellulose solution by rotary-evaporator (initially set at 40 °C and 120 mbar, subsequently reduced to a final pressure of 20 mbar at 40 °C). The solid content of the final screen-printing paste was ∼15% by weight.
For CuCrO2 photocathode fabrication, FTO coated glass (8 Ω per square, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) was cleaned using an ultrasonic bath in detergent solution, deionized water, acetone and ethanol, each for 10 min successively. CuCrO2 films with a size of 4 × 4 mm2 were coated on the FTO glass by screen-printing, dried for 10 minutes at 125 °C, and sintered under different conditions: some were sintered under air flow only, at 400 °C for 1 h, or 450 °C or 500 °C for 0.5 h, some were treated using a “two-step sintering procedure”, namely, firstly treated at 400 °C in air for 1 h to burn off the organic binder, plus a post-treatment at 550 °C under an Ar atmosphere for 1 hour to promote necking formation between the CuCrO2 nanocrystals. After cooling to 80 °C, the CuCrO2 films were immersed into 0.3 mM coumarin 343 dye alcoholic solution and kept at room temperature for 24 h.
Catalytic counter electrodes were produced by the thermal decomposition of H2PtCl6 solution on FTO-coated glasses (120 μg cm−2), using a hot-wind gun set at 400 °C for 15 minutes. CuCrO2 photocathodes were sandwiched together with the platinized counter electrodes, and sealed with a hot melt polymer gasket (25 μm, Surlyn). The electrolyte containing 0.5 M LiI and 0.1 M I2 in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (volume ratio, 85:15) was transferred into the cell by vacuum backfilling.
2.3 Characterization
The thermal stability of the CuCrO2 nanocrystals was investigated using a differential scanning calorimetry-thermogravimetric analyzer (DSC-TG, Diamond TG/DTA, PerkinElmer Instruments). The sample was heated in air from room temperature to 1000 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The crystal phases were identified by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, X'Pert PRO, Cu Kα radiation, Panalytical B. V.). The morphology of CuCrO2 nanocrystals was observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, FEI-Sirion 200, FEI), and a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Tecnai G2 20, FEI). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis was used to determine the surface area and the pore size distribution, on an ASAP 2020 accelerated surface area and porosimetry system. The thickness of the CuCrO2 films was measured using a profilometer (Dektak 150, Veeco Instruments Inc.), and the UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy was recorded on a Perkin-Elmer UV/Vis spectrophotometer (model Lambda 950) in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm. By using a mask with a size of 4.5 × 4.5 mm2 to prevent the scattering of light, the solar cells were tested using a solar simulator with an AM 1.5 G filter (Oriel, model 91192) at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and calibrated using a standard silicon reference cell. The current–voltage characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source metre. Mott–Schottky plots (1/C2vs. E) were produced to access the flat band potential on an electrochemical workstation (model CHI760D, Shanghai Chenhua Instruments) at a bias potential sweeping from 0 V to 1 V with a rate of 10 mV s−1 and at a wide frequency range from 10000 Hz to 1000 Hz. It is found that the constant flat band potential can be obtained at 1000 Hz (Fig. S1†). The film sample tested and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference were connected to the aqueous KOH (0.5 M) solution via a salt bridge. Photocurrent/photovoltage transient decays were characterized on a homemade photo-electrochemical system. The cells under illumination by different intensities of white biased light were set in the open-circuit condition, and were excited by a blue light pulse (with a pulse width of 80 ms and a rise and fall time of 100 ns) from an LED controlled by a fast solid-state switch; the decay dynamics of the photovoltage or photocurrent were recorded on a PC-interfaced Keithley 2400 source meter. By fitting the voltage or current decay signal, one could get the hole recombination time (τr) or the hole transport time.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of CuCrO2
In order to evaluate the thermal stability, the as-synthesized CuCrO2 powder samples were sintered under different conditions and checked using XRD. From Fig. 1a, for the freshly obtained powder sample before sintering, all of the diffraction peaks could be indexed to delafossite CuCrO2 in the hexagonal R3m crystal structure (JCPDS #39-0247). No impurity phase could be detected. The average crystal size was calculated to be 12 nm on average, by applying the Scherrer equation to the broadened diffraction peaks of Fig. 1a.

Fig. 1b–d show the diffraction patterns of the CuCrO2 powder samples sintered in air at 400 °C for 1 h (Fig. 1b), 450 °C for 0.5 h (Fig. 1c), and 500 °C for 0.5 h (Fig. 1d). The diffraction peaks of Fig. 1b could be identified as the pure CuCrO2 crystal phase only, but in Fig. 1c and d, diffraction peaks due to the newly generated CuO and CuCr2O4 phases could be detected. It is suggested that the following chemical reaction is involved during high temperature (>400 °C) sintering: 4CuCrO2 + O2 → 2 CuCr2O4 + 2CuO(1)

Fig. 1e shows the diffraction pattern of the CuCrO2 powder sample treated with the two-step sintering procedure. It reflects that under Ar atmosphere protection, though sintered at temperatures as high as 550 °C for 1 h, the CuCrO2 powder sample still kept a pure phase: the phase decomposition described by reaction (1) did not happen. But crystal growth during the second step of sintering at 550 °C was evident, from 15 nm to 21 nm, calculated according to the Scherrer equation.
From the thermo-gravimetric (TG) curve shown in Fig. 2, it is obvious that the mass increases sharply from a temperature of about 450 °C, indicating that reaction (1) started at that temperature in air due to the oxidation of the CuCrO2. This phenomenon is perfectly consistent with the XRD analysis. The phase transition temperature of CuCrO2 is several tens of degrees Celsius higher than that of the reported CuGaO2 in the DSSC system (∼380 °C),13,14 which allows the sintering of our screen-printed CuCrO2 films at 400 °C to burn off the organic binder, but the thermal stability of CuCrO2 is much worse than that of the reported CuAlO2, which could sustain ∼800 °C sintering in air.21 The chemical and thermal stability of the Cu based delafossite ABO2 (A = Cu; B = B, Al, Ga, In, Fe, Cr, Y, etc.) series of materials depend greatly on the B site elements. It is the B–O–B matrix that provides a chemical environment at the atomic level to protect the unstable Cu+ embedded inside, the idea of which originally came from Hosono and co-workers, who first reported the p-type transparent conductivity of the CuAlO2 film based on the so-called “chemical modulation of the valence band” theory.22 400 °C sintering of the CuCrO2 film might be insufficient for strong network formation between CuCrO2 nano building blocks; accordingly, we designed an additional post-treatment procedure for the film at a higher temperature of 550 °C under Ar atmosphere protection.

Fig. 3a and b show the TEM images of the freshly obtained CuCrO2 powder sample. From the images, it can be seen that the typical morphology of the sample consists of hexagonal nanoplates. The diameters of the nanocrystals are about 10–15 nm and their thicknesses are around 5 nm, consistent with XRD calculations. To the best of our knowledge, the size of our CuCrO2 nanocrystals is the smallest ever reported,23 and is much smaller than that of CuAlO2 (sub micron in size) and CuGaO2 nanoplates (∼100 to 200 nm × 20 to 40 nm) recently applied in a DSSC system.13,14 Identified from the high resolution TEM image of Fig. 3b, the interplanar spacing from the cross-section of the CuCrO2 nanoplates is 5.695 Å, just matching the distance between the Cu planes along the c-axis (or to say, the 〈001〉 direction) of the delafossite structure as illustrated in Fig. 3c. This result demonstrates that the top and bottom planes of the CuCrO2 nanocrystals have the {001} crystal planes exposed, which is similar to that of the reported CuGaO2 nanoplates.13Fig. 3d and e are the FE-SEM images of the CuCrO2 films after single-step sintering at 400 °C in air for 1 h (Fig. 3d) or plus a second sintering step at 550 °C under an Ar atmosphere for 1 h (Fig. 3e). It can be observed that the highly porous CuCrO2 films are crack-free. By comparing Fig. 3d and e, one could find that the CuCrO2 nanocrystals grew obviously after the second sintering step from 15 nm to 30 nm, which is consistent with the XRD results shown in Fig. 1.

The insets in (d) and (e) are the corresponding higher magnification images. 
BET tests were carried out on the freshly obtained CuCrO2 nanocrystals, NiO nanoparticles and powder samples collected by scraping the sintered films from the glass substrates under different sintering conditions. The tested BET surface area of the freshly obtained CuCrO2 nanocrystals after hydrothermal synthesis is as high as 87.86 m2 g−1; for the scraped film sample sintered at 400 °C in air for 1 h, it is 91.40 m2 g−1. The high surface areas confirm the nanoparticular nature of the CuCrO2 used in this study. After the second step of 550 °C sintering under an Ar atmosphere, the BET surface area decreases to 18.96 m2 g−1, which is consistent with crystal growth at the second step of sintering. A similar situation was found for the BET test results for NiO (commercial nanoparticles, 20 nm in size), the surface area of 45.99 m2 g−1 for the fresh nanoparticles decreases to 34.56 m2 g−1 for the scraped film sample sintered at 500 °C in air for 0.5 h. Take note that the mass density for bulk NiO is 6.7 g cm−3, higher than that of CuCrO2 (5.5 g cm−3); the actual roughness difference between the two-step sintered CuCrO2 film and the NiO film sintered at 500 °C should be (18.96 × 5.5):(34.56 × 6.7) = 0.45:1.
The presence of residue organics in the semiconductive films will hinder the dye/semiconductor interfacial process and the cell performance, so the sintered CuCrO2 films were further examined using FT-IR spectroscopy. From Fig. 4, the absorption peaks at 1055, 1373, 1731 and 2872 cm−1 in the FT-IR spectrum of the screen-printed CuCrO2 film dried at low temperature, owing to the organic binders, disappear in that of the film after sintering at 400 °C in air for 1 h, reflecting the burning off of the organics at that temperature. The FT-IR spectrum of the film sintered at 400 °C is found to be almost the same as that of the film sintered at 450 °C for 0.5 h, conditions which were generally applied to sinter TiO2 films in n-type DSSCs. From the above, it can be expected that after heat treatment at 400 °C in air for 1 h, the obtained CuCrO2 film should have an almost clean surface.

As one of the criteria for the selection of electrode materials in DSSC systems, visible light transmittance is very important. Only for transparent semiconductors could light absorption and charge collection be separately fulfilled by the dye and semiconductor, and therefore, the exciton separation could be strictly controlled at the extremely thin monolayer of dye molecules. That is the basic principle of the design of sensitized solar cells, responsible for the efficient photo-to-electron conversion. The optical transmittance spectra within the wavelength range of 300–800 nm were investigated for the CuCrO2 films with a thickness of 1.1 μm formed under different sintering conditions, and the results are shown in Fig. 5a. It can be seen that the visible light transmittances of CuCrO2 films are dependent upon the sintering conditions, and decrease with increasing sintering temperature in air, but recover after the two-step sintering procedure. The optical transmittances at a wavelength of 450 nm, where the maximum absorption by coumarin 343 dye takes place,24 are 54.95%, 39.81%, 29.74% and 4.02% for the films treated at 125 °C–0.5 h (meaning at 125 °C for 0.5 h), 400 °C–1 h, 450 °C–0.5 h and 500 °C–0.5 h, respectively. The visible light transmittance of the two-step sintering film recovers to 53.55% at 450 nm, comparable to that of the film dried at 125 °C for 0.5 h and is the best among all of the sintered CuCrO2 films. A sharp decrease in the films' optical transmittance occurs at a sintering temperature above 450 °C, just matching the temperature at which the oxidization reaction (1) begins. The result strongly suggests that light absorption of the high temperature sintered films is associated with the formation of CuO and CuCr2O4 byproducts inside the films which both can absorb visible light in nature.25 The recovery of light transmittance in the two-step sintered film might be due to the elimination of defects which could act as color centers.26Fig. 5b compares the optical transmittances of the CuCrO2 films and an NiO film with the same thickness. For the CuCrO2 film sintered solely at 400 °C in air for 1 h, the transmittance at a wavelength of 450 nm is 39.81%, slightly higher than 38.56% for the NiO reference sintered at 500 °C in air for 0.5 h, the sintering conditions of which are according to the literature.10 For the CuCrO2 film sintered by the two-step procedure, the transmittance is improved and is 53.55%, significantly higher than that of the NiO reference.

To elucidate the sintering temperature's effect, the CuCrO2 films with the same thickness of 1.1 μm were sintered in air at 400 °C for 1 h, 450 °C for 0.5 h and 500 °C for 0.5 h. Some films were treated by the “two-step sintering procedure”. For films sintered in air only, the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) and efficiency (η) all decrease dramatically as the sintering temperature becomes higher, especially when the temperature increases from 450 °C to 500 °C. The phenomena are mostly associated with the crystal phase transition and optical transmittance degradation at the elevated sintering temperatures, as discussed above. Meanwhile, after the two-step sintering, it is found that the cell performance reaches the best among all of the tested sintering conditions, with Voc of 145 mV, Jsc of 0.242 mA cm−2, and η of 0.0136%, which is remarkably improved by 60% in comparison to η of the same film without the second step of sintering under an Ar atmosphere. Possible reasons regarding to such improvement will be discussed comprehensively in a later section.
To optimize the film thickness with respect to the cell performance, CuCrO2 films under the same sintering conditions (400 °C in air for 1 hour) with thicknesses of 1.1 μm, 2.1 μm, 3.1 μm, 4.2 μm and 5.3 μm were compared. It is known that the film thickness of porous electrodes in DSSC systems is closely related to the amount absorbed by the dye, and therefore the light harvesting of the solar cell. For a transparent TiO2 nanocrystalline film, the film thickness within the effective electron diffusion length could be increased simply to maximize light harvesting by the dye. But for the CuCrO2 photocathode, since CuCrO2 itself has light absorption partially overlapping that of coumarin 343 dye, it cannot be very thick without considering such optical limitation deriving from CuCrO2. The effective hole transport length, or to say the effective hole collection length, which has been studied in p-type DSSC systems, could possibly be another limiting factor on film thickness. All of those limiting factors should be taken into account comprehensively for film thickness optimization. From the data listed in Table 1, it can be found that, in general, the Voc decreases monotonically as the film becomes thicker, while the Jsc firstly increases, becomes saturated at 3.1 μm, and then decreases. Since the optimal η was achieved at a film thickness of 3.1 μm with a value of 0.0138%, it can be concluded that the optimal thickness of the CuCrO2 photocathode film is 3.1 μm.
In addition, a 3.1 μm thick CuCrO2 film sintered by the optimized two-step sintering procedure achieved an optimal performance among all of the tested CuCrO2 based DSSCs, with Voc of 102 mV, Jsc of 0.491 mA cm−2 and η of 0.0194%. In comparison to the NiO nanoparticle based DSSC, prepared and tested under similar experimental conditions, Jsc of the best CuCrO2 based DSSC is as much as 18.9% lower than that of the NiO counterpart (0.491 mA cm−2versus 0.584 mA cm−2, Table 1), however, Voc (102 mV versus 90 mV) and FF (0.398 versus 0.318) of the CuCrO2 based DSSCs are 13.8% and 25% higher. In total, η for CuCrO2 based DSSC is 19.8% higher. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that p-type DSSCs based on semiconductors besides NiO have achieved results comparable to the standard NiO reference. Though, the reported CuGaO2 based DSSCs, sensitized with P1 dye (Voc = 180 mV, Jsc = 0.384 mA cm−2, η = 0.026%) or PMI-NDI dye (Voc = 187 mV, Jsc = 0.29 mA cm−2, η = 0.023%) were more efficient than coumarin 343 dye in the literature,13,14 our coumarin 343 dye sensitized CuCrO2 based DSSC is still superior in Jsc, which should be attributed to the much smaller size of CuCrO2 than that of the reported CuGaO2, providing a much higher surface area for dye loading.
Besides, in recently reported literature on CuAlO2 (ref. 11) and CuGaO2 (ref. 13 and 14) based DSSCs, their Voc enhancement compared to the NiO references was strongly highlighted, and it was suggested that it could be ascribed to the deeper valance band edges of CuAlO2 and CuGaO2 than NiO. The valance band edge position of CuCrO2 reported in the literature was 5.3 eV,27 while that for NiO was reported at 5.0–5.1 eV below the vacuum level.4,11 In order to confirm the possible valance band differences, we turned to Mott–Schottky measurements14,20 to compare the flat band potentials of porous CuCrO2 and NiO films, which could partially support their valance band difference, as has been reported in the literature.14 The results are shown in Fig. 6. According to the equation, (2)where Csc is the interfacial capacitance, NA is the number of acceptors, E is the applied voltage, Efp is the flatband potential, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature, and e is the electronic charge with an absolute value. The straight lines in the Mott–Schottky plots shown in Fig. 6 with negative slopes confirm that CuCrO2 and NiO are both p-type. Flatband potentials, defined as the intercepts where 1/C2 = 0, were calculated at 0.32 V vs. SCE for NiO (similar to the literature14) and 0.60 V vs. SCE for CuCrO2. The higher flat band potential of CuCrO2 than that of NiO suggests a relatively deeper valance band edge position of CuCrO2 than NiO. So, it is no surprise that in the tested CuCrO2 based DSSCs (for the two-step sintered films), Voc was observed to be 10–55 mV higher than that of the NiO reference.
 Fig. 6  Mott–Schottky plots of the CuCrO2 film (sintered in air at 400 °C for 1 h) and NiO reference (sintered in air at 500 °C for 0.5 h), with a frequency of 1000 Hz. 
In order to understand why the cell performance could be tuned according to the sintering conditions and elucidate charge (hole) collection kinetics differences between CuCrO2 and NiO, we turned to the photocurrent/photovoltage transient decay techniques. Recombination time (τr, also called lifetime) and hole transport time (τ), were defined as the time before the photo-injected holes in the porous CuCrO2 film were recaptured by the reductive species (I− ions) in the electrolyte, and the time it takes for the hole to be extracted to the out-circuit, respectively. The concepts are simply copied from those used in n-type DSSCs, assuming that the hole transport in porous semiconductive CuCrO2 photocathodes also follows a multiple trapping–detrapping model, just like the electron transport in porous TiO2.28,29 Both τ and τr were measured under the open-circuit condition as a function of the bias incident light intensity. As it varies with the incident light intensity, the voltage of the cell, or more accurately the potential offset between the quasi Femi level of the semiconductor and the redox potential of the electrolyte (EF − Eredox) is accordingly tuned, τ and τr can be obtained by fitting the photocurrent and photovoltage decay curves, respectively. More details are described in the ESI (Fig. S2†). The hole diffusion coefficient (D) and the effective hole diffusion length (L) and of p-type DSSCs were calculated via the following equations: D = d2/2.35τ and L = (Dτr)1/2, respectively, where d is the actual film thickness, and the factor of 2.35 arises from the geometry of the diffusion problem.30,31

Fig. 7 shows the hole lifetime (τr), hole diffusion coefficient (D) and effective hole diffusion length (L) versus “EF − Eredox” under different bias light intensities. From Fig. 7a and b, it is clear that the dependencies of τr and D on “EF − Eredox” fit well with the power law, τr monotonically decreases and D monotonically increases with increasing “EF − Eredox”. These phenomena are in good accordance with the multiple trapping model:28,29 with increasing “EF − Eredox”, corresponding to holes at the quasi-Femi level closer to the valance band edge, the holes require a smaller activation energy or a shorter waiting time to be detrapped, which is why the corresponding D is larger; by the same token, it becomes easier for the holes to migrate to the CuCrO2/electrolyte interface leading to the corresponding shorter τr. Fig. 7c shows that L decreases with increasing “EF − Eredox”. L is closely related to the charge collection efficiency. If L is much longer than the actual film thickness, it means most of the photoinjected holes can be extracted through the porous CuCrO2 film to the out-circuit without recombination loss.
 Fig. 7  The dependencies of (a) hole lifetime (τr), (b) hole diffusion coefficient (D) and (c) the effective hole diffusion length (L) on “EF − Eredox” for different cells (CuCrO2 based cells sintered at different conditions and an NiO reference cell), under different bias light intensities. 
In more detail, it can be found from Fig. 7a and b that τr and D for the CuCrO2 films treated at different sintering conditions follow the same sequence for two-step sintering, >400 °C in air for 1 h, >450 °C in air for 0.5 h and >500 °C in air for 0.5 h over almost the whole “EF − Eredox” range. The improvements in τr and D for the two-step sintered film compared to the 400 °C sintered film should be mostly attributed to crystal growth and neck fusion of CuCrO2 during the second step of higher temperature sintering under an Ar atmosphere, strengthening the electrical connections between the nanosized CuCrO2 building blocks of the photocathode. The deterioration of τr and D for films sintered at elevated temperatures of 400 °C, 450 °C and 500 °C, should be mainly ascribed to the partial crystal phase decomposition of CuCrO2 to CuO and CuCr2O4. In combining τr and D, the effective hole diffusion length L, or to say the charge collection efficiency of the cells are in the following sequence: two-step sintered, >400 °C for 1 h, >450 °C for 0.5 h, >500 °C for 0.5 h. The observation that τr, D and L are dependent upon sintering conditions agrees well with the J–V characteristics of CuCrO2 based DSSCs: Jsc, Voc and η follow the same variation as L with the sintering conditions. It is understandable for Jsc to decrease in the sequence: two-step sintering, >400 °C in air for 1 h, >450 °C in air for 0.5 h, >500 °C in air for 0.5 h. This is because in such a sequence, the optical transmittance of the CuCrO2 films becomes worse resulting in a lower light harvesting efficiency (LHE); in addition, the charge collection efficiency (ηcc) as reflected by the shortening L also becomes worse. Light harvesting efficiency and charge collection efficiency will both contribute to the total incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE), which determines Jsc according to IPCE = LHE × Φinj × ηcc, in which Φinj is the hole injection efficiency from dye to semiconductor.2 The Voc deterioration, in the sequence: two-step sintered, >400 °C in air for 1 h, >450 °C in air for 0.5 h, >500 °C in air for 0.5 h, should be associated with the decreasing τr in such a sequence. Shorter τr meaning faster interfacial recombination will lead to a decrease in Voc,32 according to the familiar expression for Voc of solar cells: (3)where Iinj is the injection current, and Idark is the dark current due to interfacial recombination which is proportional to the recombination rate.33,34 Furthermore, τr, D and L of the NiO reference cell were also included in Fig. 7 for comparison. It is found that τr for the NiO film in the tested “EF − Eredox” range is nearly the shortest among all the tested films, with a value ranging from 10−1 to 10−2 s, consistent with the data reported in literature.3,5D for the NiO film is obviously lower than that of the CuCrO2 films, for example, the best D corresponding to the two-step sintered CuCrO2 film is around 10−5 cm2 s−1, while that for the NiO film is only 10−7 to 10−6 cm2 s−1; the difference between them remarkably reaches 1–2 orders of magnitude. Such a difference might be derived from the good conductivity of delafossite ABO2 materials in nature (see our results for Hall effect measurements for a CuCrO2 tablet in Table S1†).15–17 In combination, L for the NiO reference film is around 1 magnitude shorter than that for the CuCrO2 films, with a value of only 1–2 μm, which might limit the optimal thickness of the NiO photocathode to around only 2 μm.5,10
It is noteworthy that the charge collection efficiency for the two-step sintered CuCrO2 film is thought to be much better than that for the NiO reference, but from the data in Table 1, it can be found that Jsc for the NiO based DSSC is even higher than that for the best CuCrO2 based DSSC. There seems to be a contradiction, so we studied the amounts of the dye (coumarin 343) adsorbed for the NiO and CuCrO2 photocathode films for further details. For the two-step sintered CuCrO2 film, the density of the dye adsorbed is 26.66 nmol μm−1 cm−2, while for the NiO reference, it is 58.14 nmol μm−1 cm−2. The difference is 26.66:58.14 = 0.46:1, which is consistent with the roughness difference of 0.45:1 as discussed before, determined from the BET surface areas and mass densities. To sum up, the two-step sintered CuCrO2 film has a superior optical transmittance to the NiO film, but its internal surface area decreases too much due to the second-step sintering at 550 °C leading to a lower amount of dye adsorbing than for the NiO reference, so the light harvesting efficiency for the CuCrO2 film should still be smaller, which may account for the relatively low Jsc of the CuCrO2 based DSSCs compared to that of the NiO reference. It is believed that there is still room to improve the performance of CuCrO2 based DSSCs by more carefully optimizing the sintering conditions of the CuCrO2 photocathode.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we first report a facile hydrothermal synthesis of ultrasmall CuCrO2 nanocrystals, the smallest ever reported. Their applications as photocathodes were first demonstrated, and they worked efficiently in p-type DSSCs. The CuCrO2 nanocrystals have a high surface area, suitably high optical transmittance in visible light and thermal stability. The Voc, Jsc and η of the optimal CuCrO2 based DSSC sensitized with coumarin 343 dye were 102 mV, 0.491 mA cm−2 and 0.0194%. Compared to other p-type semiconductors (such as NiO tested in this work and CuGaO2 in the literature13,14) used in DSSCs, the CuCrO2-based DSSC has a higher Voc than that of NiO due to the nature of the deeper valence band potential, and a higher Jsc than that of CuGaO2 due to a much higher surface area. Therefore, the CuCrO2 nanocrystals are more competitive than those p-type semiconductors used in DSSCs to date. Our current efforts are to further optimize the dye and the redox mediators, or develop doped CuCrO2 to improve stability and optical transmittance, to improve the photovoltaic performances of the associated p type-DSSCs.
