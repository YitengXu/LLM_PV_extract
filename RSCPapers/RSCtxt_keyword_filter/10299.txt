    , Accepted 7th February 2022First published on 8th February 2022AbstractThe carrier recombination loss induced by defects, imperfect contact and energy level barriers at the buried interface severely restricts the greater advancement of comprehensive performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a versatile inorganic ammonium salt of diammonium hydrogen phosphate (DAP) is exploited as a “double-sided tape” modifier to be deposited at the TiO2/perovskite buried interface, which not only passivates the surface defects of TiO2 and perovskite layers and simultaneously bridges the two films via the chemical reactions of hydrogen phosphate anions and ammonium cations in DAP with TiO2 and CsPbBr3 perovskite, respectively, but also ameliorates the interface contact and energy level alignment. Moreover, a higher quality perovskite film with fewer grain boundaries and defects is tightly formed on the DAP modified TiO2 layer arising from its lower wettability. Consequently, a substantially improved charge transport and extraction and minimized charge recombination are achieved in DAP tailored all-inorganic hole transport layer-free CsPbBr3 PSCs, yielding a power conversion efficiency as high as 10.31% with an impressive open-circuit voltage of 1.621 V, which is highly increased compared to 7.58% for the control device. Furthermore, the optimized device free of encapsulation exhibits a superior long-term stability after exposure to an air atmosphere at 85 °C with 85% RH over 720 h.
Introduction
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has increased sharply to 25.7% in just a few years through the improvements in strategies such as the optimization of perovskite film quality, interface engineering, additive engineering, strain engineering and so on.1–7 Sadly, the intrinsic decomposition of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials in these cells under the attacks of heat, humidity, light and oxygen seriously destroys the long-term operation stability, which has become a bottleneck problem for the industrial application of PSCs.8–12 To solve this issue, all-inorganic CsPbIxBr3−x (x = 0, 1, 2 or 3) perovskites have attracted extensive attention and are recognized as the most promising substitutes owing to their prominent heat tolerance.13 Among the substitutes, wide-bandgap (∼2.3 eV) full-brominated CsPbBr3 perovskite has the complete tolerance towards all kinds of extreme environments, displaying great application potential in tandem solar cells and electronic devices requiring high-voltage output drive.14,15 However, the PCE loss of all-inorganic CsPbBr3 is relatively large because the slow charge extraction at the charge-transport layer/perovskite film interface and defect states within perovskite films induces severe charge recombinations.16
A classic CsPbBr3 PSC is composed of a perovskite layer sandwiched between an electron-transport layer (ETL) and a carbon electrode, and the properties of each layer have an important impact on the final photovoltaic performance of the device.17 TiO2 is the most commonly used ETL due to the advantages of excellent optical transmittance, energy level matching, easy preparation, etc., but the inevitably formed defect states like surface oxygen vacancies and uncoordinated Ti3+ during the process of crystal phase transformation terribly suppress charge extraction, leading to an obvious reduction of PSC performance.18–21 Moreover, the band structure and the surface properties of TiO2 ETLs play a major role in regulating interface energy level matching, interface contact and perovskite film growth, respectively, which are the key factors that determine the rapid transfer of charge and the minimum recombination of charge to boost PSC performance.22 Therefore, the surface modification of TiO2 ETLs with organic or inorganic compounds has been extensively implemented to optimize the interface properties and perovskite growth to promote charge extraction for a higher output of the device PCE.23–25 For instance, Shen et al. modified the interface of TiO2 ETLs and CsPbBr3 using a metal organic framework material (ZIF-8) to promote the orderly growth of microcrystals inside the perovskite layer and enhance the cohesion between the CsPbBr3 film and the porous TiO2 substrate, which finally resulted in the formation of a high-quality light absorption layer and more perfect energy level alignment to improve the performance of the PSCs.26 Zhang et al. reported a dopamine-modified TiO2 film as the ETL to increase the charge-extraction efficiency and decrease the charge-recombination rate by ameliorating interface binding and reducing oxygen vacancy trap states in TiO2 and uncoordinated Pb atom defects in perovskite, improving the PCE of the modified device from 18.15% of the control one to 20.93%.27 Similarly, Yang et al. modified the TiO2 ETL with a triblock fullerene derivative to passivate the surface defect of TiO2 to descend the charge recombination loss and improve charge extraction, leading to an increase in the PCE from 12.58% of the control device to 16.81% of the PSC with modification layer.28 The successful instances described above strongly suggest that the interface engineering with multifunctional modifiers at the TiO2/perovskite buried interface is viable and efficient for further improving the PCE of PSCs.29–31
Herein, a common and stable inorganic ammonium salt of diammonium hydrogen phosphate (DAP) with the advantages including cost effectiveness, easy preparation and low toxicity, containing positive and negative ions in contrast with Lewis base or acid that endows it with the function of simultaneous reactions with anions and cations is exploited as a “double-sided tape” modifier to be deposited at the TiO2/perovskite buried interface to effectively improve the PSC performance. The modification of DAP can concurrently passivate the interfacial defects and modulate the interface contact and energy level matching as well as perovskite growth. In detail, the oxygen vacancy imperfections of TiO2 are passivated by bonding with the hydrogen phosphate anion of DAP, and the wettability and energy band structure of the TiO2 film are ameliorated after modifying DAP to favor the formation of a CsPbBr3 film with enlarged grain and a more matched energy level between ETL and perovskite layers, respectively. In the meantime, the N–H bond of ammonium ions in DAP and Br ions in CsPbBr3 can bind with hydrogen bonds (N–H⋯Br−) to passivate the uncoordinated anion defects in perovskite. The chemical interactions of DAP with both TiO2 and perovskite layers also form a bridge between the two films, together with the decreased roughness of the DAP modified TiO2 layer, resulting in a more perfect contact at the buried interface. The multifaceted improvements of DAP interface modification substantially boost electron extraction and inhibit charge recombination inside PSCs, leading to a marked PCE increase from 7.58% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.483 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 6.77 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 75.46% for the control device to a champion efficiency of 10.31% (VOC: 1.621 V, JSC: 7.57 mA cm−2 and FF: 84.05%) for DAP tailored PSCs. Furthermore, the unencapsulated device with DAP interface modification maintains ultra-high long-term stability after being exposed to the air environment at 85 °C with 85% RH for more than 720 h. These results exhibit that the “double-sided tape” modification of DAP successfully proposes a new strategy for passivating defects, improving interface contact and adjusting energy level matching and perovskite growth to obtain high-performance PSCs.
Experimental section
Materials and reagents
Diammonium hydrogen phosphate (DAP, AR, 99.0%), lead bromide (PbBr2, AR, 99.9%), cesium bromide (CsBr, AR, 99.9%) and reagents for preparing the TiO2 slurry were all purchased from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd; the low temperature carbon slurry was purchased from Shanghai Maiwei Chemical New Material Technology Co., Ltd. All reagents were used directly without any purification.
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
FTO was etched using zinc powder and hydrochloric acid to obtain a 2 mm insulating groove and sonicated with deionized water, acetone, isopropanol and ethanol solution in sequence. Then, 90 μL of 0.5 M anhydrous ethanol of isopropyl titanate and diethanolamine solution was spin-coated on the etched FTO substrate (7000 rpm, 30 s) and annealed at 500 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace to obtain a compact electron layer (c-TiO2). The prepared TiO2 colloidal solution was spin-coated on the c-TiO2 layer (2000 rpm, 30 s) and annealed in the muffle furnace at 450 °C for 30 min to fabricate a mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) layer. Then the above FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 substrate was immersed in a 0.04 M titanium tetrachloride aqueous solution at 75 °C for 30 min, washed with deionized water and ethanol, and annealed at 450 °C for 30 min to obtain the final TiO2 ETL. DAP was modified on the TiO2 ETL by spin-coating 90 μL of DAP aqueous solution with different concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1 mg ml−1 named DAP-0.1, DAP-0.2, DAP-0.5 and DAP-1, respectively) at 2000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 70 °C for 30 min. Next, the perovskite layer was prepared by the multi-step spin coating method reported in our previous work.32 Finally, the conductive carbon paste was scraped on the perovskite layer and annealed at 90 °C for 30 min to assemble a whole PSC. The above processes were all carried out in an air atmosphere free of any humidity control.
Measurements and characterization
The elemental analysis was carried out by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS: PHI-5000CESCA system) using Mg Kα (hν = 1253.6 eV). The infrared absorption peaks of various samples were measured by using a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) system (Cary 680, Agilent). The 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) test was performed at room temperature using a Bruker Avance Ultra-Shield Plus device. The surface morphology was characterized by using Japanese company Hitachi S4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipment to view the surface images of TiO2 films, PbBr2 films, CsPbBr3 films, and cross-sectional images of the whole device and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mapping images of TiO2/DAP films. Atomic force microscopy, AFM, was performed with an Innova Scanning Probe Microscope 9700 (Shimadzu, Japan). The crystal phase structure was detected with an X-ray diffractometer (XRD: PHILIPSPW1800) using Cu-Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å). An ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer (Meipuda UV-3200) was employed to record the absorption spectrum of the perovskite film. The space charge limited current (SCLC) model was employed to characterize the trap state density and the electron mobility of perovskite films as well as the defect density of TiO2 films for electron-only equipment in the voltage range of 0 to 7 V under dark conditions. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) tests were carried out on a Kratos AXIS ULTRA system. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves and steady-state PCE output curves were obtained on the CHI660E electrochemical workstation under illumination with a simulated light source (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) at an incident light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell. A confocal fluorescence microscope (ISS Q2 FLIM/FFS, ISS Inc.) was employed to measure the cross-sectional confocal PL mapping images at 405 nm excitation wavelength. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) of various samples was characterized using a FluoroMax-4 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL) measurement was conducted on a time-resolved fluorescence spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon, FL). The transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements of different devices were performed under 0.3 sun illumination on a monomolecular counter. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) curves were tested under dark conditions in the 1 MHz to 0.1 Hz frequency range with 10 mV AC amplitude. The incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured by using an IPCE kit from Enli Technology Co., Ltd. The VOC decay curves were recorded by illuminating the device with simulated sunlight (AM 1.5G) in the open-circuit state for 2 s and then turning off the light and covering with a shading box. The dark J–V curves were measured at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 in the voltage range from −1.5 to 1.5 V.
Results and discussion
In this work, DAP, containing hydrogen phosphate anions and ammonium cations with the chemical structural formula shown in Fig. S1,† was employed as a “double-sided tape” modifier at the TiO2/perovskite buried interface to regulate interface properties and simultaneously play a role in passivating the defects and optimizing the growth of the perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 1a, the numerous defect states, such as the oxygen vacancies of the TiO2 film and uncoordinated ions of the perovskite film, at TiO2/perovskite buried interface would cause serious non-radiative recombination. In addition, the imperfect interface contact (this will be presented in top of Fig. 3a) that causes sluggish charge extraction and transfer processes and poor quality of the perovskite film are unquestionably responsible for disastrous charge recombination and energy loss. Apparently, such a poor interface behavior is an urgent problem which needs to be addressed for further improving the device performance. Interestingly, after employing DAP as a modifier at the TiO2/perovskite interface, it would play a functional role similar to that of “double-sided tape”. First, the TiO2 film with the DAP modifier would become flatter and smoother for the formation of perfect contact with the loaded perovskite film (as shown in bottom of Fig. 3a) to boost the charge extraction and transfer. Meanwhile, the DAP modifier can combine with TiO2 and perovskite films like a double-sided crosslinking agent for simultaneously passivating the defects and bridging the surfaces of the two films. In more detail, the incomplete coordination sphere of Ti atoms on the TiO2 surface display large affinity for oxygen-containing ligands,33 and as a result, the oxygen-rich hydrogen phosphate anions in the DAP modifier can combine with the uncoordinated surface Ti atoms on the TiO2 film to eliminate the oxygen vacancy defects to enhance electron extraction.27 At the same time, the ammonium cations in DAP can bind with the Br ions in CsPbBr3 by forming a hydrogen bond of N–H⋯Br− to passivate surface anion defects. Notably, it has been demonstrated that the ammonium cations can interact with the Pb–I frameworks to delay the nucleation of perovskite for large-grained perovskite film formation,34 and in this way, the ammonium cations in DAP can also promote the growth of large grains in CsPbBr3 films.

The XPS and FTIR, 1H NMR spectra of various samples including TiO2 and perovskite films (Fig. 1b–g) were obtained to demonstrate the interaction and elemental composition at the DAP modified TiO2/perovskite interface. As presented in Fig. 1b, the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 states in TiO2 exhibit the sharp characteristic peaks at 458.73 and 464.31 eV, respectively, which shift slightly in the direction of lower binding energies (458.44 and 464.15 eV) for the DAP modified TiO2 sample, illustrating that more negative charges surround Ti atoms through bonding with the hydrogen phosphate anion in DAP.35 Furthermore, as shown in the FTIR spectra in Fig. S2,† the presence of the P–O bond at a lower wavenumber for the TiO2/DAP sample in comparison with that for DAP also demonstrates an interaction between the hydrogen phosphate anion in DAP and TiO2, cross-validating the analysis shown in Fig. 1b. The characteristic peak of O 1s shown in Fig. 1c consists of a strong peak at a low binding energy and a shoulder peak at a high binding energy, corresponding to the bonds of lattice oxygen (OL) and oxygen-deficient defects like oxygen vacancies and hydroxyl (OD), respectively.27,36–43 For the DAP modified TiO2 sample, O 1s shifts to a lower binding energy compared to that for the control one, which further evidences the interaction between DAP and TiO2.35 Besides, the component concentration of OL and OD can be reflected by the area ratio of the corresponding peaks, and after modifying the TiO2 film with DAP, the area ratio of OL:OD is increased from 67.4:32.6 to 72.9:27.1, strongly indicating that the hydrogen phosphate anion combines with the oxygen vacancy of the TiO2 film to reduce the concentration of OD along with the simultaneous formation the lattice oxygen for an increased OL concentration,20,44 which cross-verifies the above analysis results and fully demonstrates that the modification of DAP effectively passivates the oxygen vacancy defects on the TiO2 film surface. The healing of TiO2 oxygen vacancy defects can contribute to effective extraction of electrons to improve JSC.45 Moreover, the appearance of N 1s and P 2p characteristic peaks at about 400 eV and 132 eV, respectively, for the DAP modified sample shown in Fig. 1d and e suggests the successful deposition of DAP on the TiO2 film. In order to directly indicate the passivation of TiO2 surface defects, the SCLC technology was employed to measure the defect state density (ntrap) of different TiO2 samples with the ETL-only devices, and the recorded dark J–V curves are shown in Fig. S3.† Depending on the value of the trap filling limit voltage (VTFL), the ntrap can be determined using the following relationship: ntrap = 2εε0VTFL/eL2, where ε and ε0 represent the relative permittivity of TiO2 and vacuum permittivity, respectively, L is the thickness of the TiO2 film, and e is the basic charge of an electron.46 As shown in the calculation results in Table S1,† the ntrap is reduced to 4.52 × 1017 cm−3 for the TiO2/DAP-0.2 sample from 5.69 × 1017 cm−3 for the control one, which thoroughly corroborates that the defects of TiO2 are passivated by the DAP modifier.
The interaction between DAP and the perovskite film was also explored and demonstrated. As shown in the FTIR spectra of different samples in Fig. 1f, the infrared characteristic peak of the N–H bond of the ammonium cation in DAP shifts to a lower wavenumber after depositing CsPbBr3, suggesting that there is an interaction between the ammonium cation and CsPbBr3 perovskite. The upfield shift of the 1H NMR spectrum for the DAP/CsPbBr3 sample in contrast with that for the DAP sample shown in Fig. 1g confirms the N–H⋯Br− hydrogen-bonding interaction between ammonium cations in DAP and Br ions in perovskite, which contributes to passivate uncoordinated bromine anions in CsPbBr3 perovskite to lessen trap states.47,48
To more systematically verify the positive effect of DAP as a “double-sided tape” modifier at the buried interface on the quality and properties of TiO2 and perovskite films, the physical characterization of various samples was performed and is shown in Fig. 2. First, the effect of DAP as a “double-sided tape” modifier on the surface morphology of the TiO2 film was observed by SEM, as shown in Fig. 2a. Compared with the control TiO2 film, the DAP modified sample exhibits a similar mesoporous structure and uniform DAP coverage, leading to a full penetration of perovskite and excellent contact and modification function of the interface, which is in favor of increasing the absorption of photons and reducing the interface resistance for a higher current output. The even distribution of P and N elements of DAP along with Ti and O of TiO2 displayed in EDS mapping images more persuasively indicates the uniform surface coverage of DAP on the TiO2 film surface, which is in accordance with the above results of N 1s and P 2p XPS images (Fig. 1d and e). Notably, the modification of DAP shows no negative impact on the transmission spectra of TiO2 ETLs, and as shown in Fig. S4,† the same and remarkable light transmittance in the 350–700 nm wavelength range is present for different TiO2 films, which ensures adequate photon-harvest for perovskite deposited on the TiO2/DAP substrate to realize a high PCE output. Moreover, the surface roughness of different TiO2 films and the contact angle of DMF on the corresponding samples are shown in Fig. 2b. For the AFM images of TiO2 films modified with and without DAP, a lower root mean square (RMS) value of 16.7 nm of the DAP modified TiO2 film compared to 22.8 nm for the control sample suggests that the former film exhibits a reduced roughness to improve the contact between TiO2 and perovskite films (Fig. 3a) for reducing the buried interfacial contact resistance and accelerating extraction and transfer of electrons.49 Interestingly, the contact angle of DMF on the TiO2/DAP film is increased to 15.99° compared with 7.16° for the control TiO2 film, implying a decreased wettability of DMF on the former film, which would form fewer nucleation sites of the PbBr2 precursor solution and therefore facilitate the formation of the final perovskite film with a larger grain size (Fig. 2e).50 For verification of the above analysis, the surface morphology and crystallinity of PbBr2 films deposited on the control and DAP modified TiO2 substrates were characterized and are displayed in Fig. 2c and d, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2c, the PbBr2 film deposited on the TiO2/DAP substrate exhibits more voids than the control one owing to the lower wettability of the DAP modified TiO2 film, which can be convincingly understood by comparing the blue ((1)) and red ((2)) regions in different samples, respectively. Meanwhile, the slightly decreased characteristic peak intensity of the PbBr2 film deposited on the TiO2/DAP substrate compared to that of the TiO2/PbBr2 film (Fig. 2d) illustrates lower crystallinity of the former film, which suggests a delayed crystallization rate of PbBr2 possible due to its interaction with ammonium cations in DAP.51 The more voids together with the lower crystallinity of the TiO2/DAP/PbBr2 film are conducive to the full diffusion of the subsequently spin-coated CsBr solution to promote the complete growth of CsPbBr3 crystals and enlarge the grain size.

(b) The AFM images and contact angles of DMF for control (top) and DAP modified TiO2 (bottom) films. (c) The top-view SEM images of PbBr2 films deposited on control (top) and DAP modified TiO2 (bottom) substrates, where the scale bars correspond to 5 μm. (d) XRD patterns of PbBr2 films deposited on the TiO2 layer with and without the DAP modifier.

(f) XRD patterns of CsPbBr3 films deposited on different TiO2 layers. (g) The dark J–V curves of ETL-only devices with a structure of FTO/TiO2/with and without DAP/perovskite/PCBM/Carbon. 
To more intuitively explore the effect of the DAP modifier on the perovskite film quality, the SEM characterization was performed to observe the surface morphology of perovskite films deposited on different TiO2 substrates, as shown in Fig. 2e. Apparently, all the perovskite films deposited on TiO2/DAP layers display larger, more uniform and compact grains in comparison with the control one, and the average grain size of the former films is increased to 979 nm from 550 nm for the control one (Fig. S5†), which matches with the results of TiO2/DAP surface contact angle analysis and favors the reduction of the grain boundary and therefore charge recombination. Fig. 2f shows the XRD patterns of perovskite films deposited on various TiO2 layers, and all samples exhibit the diffraction peaks of the CsPbBr3 phase consistent with previous reports,52 indicating that the “double-sided tape” modification of DAP does not induce changes in the perovskite phase. Notably, the intensity of characteristic peaks for the CsPbBr3 film deposited on TiO2 with the DAP modifier is apparently higher than that for the control one, which manifests a better crystallinity of the former films and therefore a lower imperfection for retained charge recombination due to the complete growth of the CsPbBr3 crystal modulated by introducing DAP. In order to better appreciate the enhanced quality of the perovskite film, especially the reduction of defect states, the ntrap of various perovskite films was also measured by SCLC technology (Fig. 2g), and the results calculated according to the relationship ntrap = 2εε0VTFL/eL2 (in which ε and L stand for the relative permittivity and the thickness of the perovskite film, respectively) are summarized in Table S2.†46 Apparently, the ntrap is remarkably decreased from 2.06 × 1016 cm−3 for the control film to 1.62 × 1016 cm−3 for the DAP-0.2 modified sample, cross-validating the reduction of defect states arising from the grain size and crystallinity increase of the latter film and the passivation effect of DAP on perovskite imperfections. In addition, the absorbance of DAP modified perovskite films is distinctly higher than that of the control sample due to the quality improvement and defect passivation, as depicted in the UV-vis absorption spectra in Fig. S6,† which is beneficial to generate more electrons by absorbing more photons to boost JSC and PCE outputs for DAP tailored devices. To further explore the quality improvement and defect state passivation of perovskite films, the steady-state PL spectra excited from the air side of perovskite films directly deposited on glass substrates with or without DAP modification were also measured, as described in Fig. S7.† As expected, the PL peak of the glass/DAP/perovskite samples shows a tiny blue shift and a higher intensity compared to that of glass/perovskite, which further indicates a reduction of defects in the former perovskite films arising from their quality perfection and defect healing after incorporating the DAP interface modifier.22
To more intuitively explore the function of DAP as a “double-sided tape” modifier at the buried interface in the enhancement of PSC photoelectric performance, the multilayer solar cell prototype with an architecture of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2 without and with DAP/perovskite/carbon was assembled, in which the carbon electrode has dual functions of the hole transport layer and back electrode, which can obviously simplify the preparation process and reduce production costs. As shown in Fig. 3a, the cross-sectional SEM images of the devices without and with the DAP modifier display distinctly different morphological characteristics. The perovskite layer in the control device exhibits the multi-layer polycrystalline structure with excessive grain boundaries (centers for charge recombination), which is not conducive to the extraction and transfer of holes and electron pairs to result in severe radiation recombination and non-radiation recombination inside the perovskite film and/or at the perovskite/charge transport layer interface (as shown in the top of Fig. 3b) and therefore unsatisfactory PCE, JSC and FF outputs.53 However, after employing DAP as a “double-sided tape” modifier at the buried interface, the structural layers of the modified device are in close contact with the adjacent layers, and the perovskite layer displays the characteristics of monolayer and vertical single-crystal distributions, which is beneficial to reduce the series resistance and accelerate the rapid and orderly transfer of electrons and holes (as shown in the bottom of Fig. 3b) for significantly boosting the device power output. To further verify the electron–hole pair transport and recombination mechanism inside the different samples shown in Fig. 3b, the confocal PL microscopy characterization on the cross-sections of the control and DAP modified perovskite films was performed, as presented in Fig. 3c. Apparently, the control sample exhibits discontinuous lateral luminescence with obviously large dark gaps in the middle (such as region (1)) and bottom (such as region (2)), dividing the cross section into several subsections, which is related to the luminescence quenching at grain boundaries (regions (1) and (2)) shown in Fig. 3a.54 As expected, the dark gaps associated with grain boundaries are effectively eliminated after incorporating DAP at the TiO2/perovskite buried interface and brighter fluorescence is displayed for the modified sample than that for the control one, which is attributed to the characteristics of monolayer and vertical single-crystal distributions (bottom of Fig. 3a), and reduced defect state density and larger grains of the modified sample. The above results convincingly demonstrate the charge transport and recombination mechanism summarized in Fig. 3b, indicating that DAP, as a “double-sided tape” modifier, can effectively accelerate charge transport and suppress charge recombination at the TiO2/perovskite interface and/or inside the perovskite block owing to its remarkable functions in improving interface contact and TiO2 and perovskite film quality. Moreover, as the corresponding cross-sectional mapping images of different samples shown in Fig. 3d, compared to the control sample, the uniform distribution of the N element of DAP at the modified TiO2/perovskite interface confirms its effective improvement effect on perfecting interface contact and TiO2 and perovskite film quality, cross-checking the validity of the above analysis.

Subsequently, the influence of DAP modification on the band structure of the TiO2 ETL was detected by UPS and UV-vis spectra, as shown in Fig. S8.† Compared with −4.29 eV of the control TiO2, the Fermi level (EF) of the DAP modified TiO2 moves up to −4.04 eV owing to the formation of the surface dipole after introduction of DAP.55 According to the value of EF–EVB (valence band) shown in Fig. S8,† the EVB of TiO2 ETLs without and with DAP modification is calculated to be −7.21 eV and −7.14 eV, respectively. Then, the conduction band (ECB) attained by EVB plus band gap (Eg) is −4.01 eV and −3.92 eV for control and DAP modified TiO2 films, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the difference between EF and ECB is 0.28 eV and 0.12 eV for the control and DAP modified films, respectively. The decrease in this difference indicates that the space charge limited area reduces and the conductivity increases for the DAP modified TiO2 ETL, which is beneficial to the effective collection and transfer of electrons. As shown in the detailed energy level diagram in Fig. 3e, the DAP modified TiO2 ETL presents a closer ECB to that of perovskite in contrast to the control one, suggesting that the energy barrier of electron transfer from perovskite to the ETL is reduced for DAP tailored PSCs, which is expected to reduce charge accumulation and energy loss at the TiO2/perovskite interface, consequently enhancing charge extraction and photovoltaic performance. In addition, the electron mobility (μe) of perovskite films deposited on various TiO2 substrates can be calculated by the Mott–Gurney law JD = 9μeεε0V2/8L3 in accordance with the SCLC technology, where JD represents the dark current density, and V represents the applied voltage.46 The larger the slope of the JD1/2–V curves (Fig. S10†) the higher the μe, and the specific calculation values are indicated in Table S2.† Compared with 4.52 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 of the control film, the μe of the TiO2/DAP-0.2/perovskite sample is substantially increased to 11.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 owing to the improved perovskite quality, buried interface contact and energy level matching as well as the defect passivation on surfaces of TiO2 and perovskite layers by DAP, which is beneficial to the extraction and transfer of electrons.

Fig. 3f shows the J–V curves of various PSCs characterized under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) simulated sunlight illumination, and the detailed performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. The control device displays a PCE of 7.58% with a JSC of 6.77 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.483 V and a FF of 75.46%, which is in accordance with the previously reported efficiency of carbon-based hole-transport layer-free all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs.56 After incorporating DAP as a “double-sided tape” modifier, a maximum PCE of 10.31% with an elevated VOC of 1.621 V, a JSC of 7.57 mA cm−2 and a FF of 84.05% is achieved for DAP-0.2 tailored all-inorganic CsPbBr3 PSCs. This efficiency is a leading-edge value in the PCEs of the state-of-the-art CsPbBr3 PSCs as listed in Table S3.† The apparent increase of the VOC and FF is attributed to the fewer interface defects inducing low charge recombination and the smaller energy barrier causing rapid charge extraction in the DAP tailored device. The elevated absorbance of the higher quality perovskite film with the DAP modifier along with the suppressed charge recombination is responsible for the JSC improvement. Moreover, compared with the control device shown in Fig. S10,† the DAP tailored device exhibits a weaker hysteresis owing to the passivation of surface ion defects of TiO2 and perovskite layers and the promotion of electron extraction resulting from the more perfect interface contact and the smaller interfacial energy barrier after DAP modification. In order to prove the reliability of the device performance advancement, the IPCE spectrum along with the corresponding integrated current density was tested, as shown in Fig. S11.† All PSCs have excellent light response in the wavelength range of 325–535 nm, which is consistent with the results of the UV-vis absorption spectrum. Nevertheless, the IPCE value and current density of the optimized device increase from 78% and 6.66 mA cm−2 for the control device to 87% and 7.47 mA cm−2, respectively, which match well with the JSC from the J–V tests. Furthermore, the steady-state photocurrent and PCE outputs of the PSCs modified with and without DAP at the buried interface are compared in Fig. 3g. The DAP tailored PSCs exhibit a higher and more stable photocurrent density and PCE with a value consistent with the characterization of J–V curves than the control device, also evidencing the reliability of photovoltaic performance boost of the former PSCs. At the same time, as shown in Fig. S12,† the statistics of photovoltaic parameters for thirty control and optimized devices were performed. All photovoltaic data of the optimized PSC are higher and more concentrated in contrast with those of the control one, strongly illustrating the validity of performance enhancement of the former PSC and the repeatability of device fabrication.

To better explore the action mechanism of DAP as a “double-sided tape” modifier at the buried interface in improving photovoltaic performance of the devices, the internal charge extraction and transport kinetics were systematically studied. First, the VOC decay curves of various PSCs (Fig. 4a) were obtained to evaluate the charge recombination. It is obvious that the decay time of VOC for DAP tailored devices is longer than that for the control one, indicating fewer occurrences of recombination reactions in the former devices. In addition, according to the formula τn = −(kT/q) × (dVOC/dt)−1, where k stands for the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature,57 the lifetime of photogenerated electrons before being captured by the trap states can be determined. As can be seen from Fig. 4b, the prolonged electron lifetime of the DAP tailored devices in comparison with that of the control PSC further demonstrates the repressed charge recombination in the former devices, which is attributed to the effective passivation of interfacial defects and the quality improvement of the perovskite film after DAP interface modification. Lower charge recombination can result in higher VOC and FF outputs, which is in an agreement with the phenomenon of J–V curves shown in Fig. 3f. The M–S plots (Fig. 4c) display that the DAP tailored devices have a larger extracted built-in potential, Vbi, and a smaller interface charge density (it is inversely proportional to the straight-line slope of the M–S plot) than the control one, illustrating a stronger driving force for the extraction and transportation of electron and hole carriers and a reduced interface charge accumulation within the former devices, which contribute to the repression of carrier recombination to yield a higher PCE.46 To further investigate the extraction and transport of charges between perovskite and TiO2/DAP ETLs, the steady-state PL spectra excited from the FTO side of PSCs were examined and are presented in Fig. 4d. Evidently, the perovskite film deposited on the TiO2/DAP-0.2 layer exhibits the most strong fluorescence quenching phenomenon in comparison with other samples, which indicates the rapid photogenerated carrier separation inside the perovskite film and the more efficient charge transfer at the interface between the perovskite light-absorbing layer and TiO2/DAP-0.2 ETL. Meanwhile, the PL emission peaks of DAP tailored PSCs exhibit a blue shift in contrast with that of the control one, demonstrating fewer defect states of the former device perovskite films, thanks to the passivation and the positive crystal growth regulation after DAP “double-sided tape” modification, which cross-validates the results of SCLC (Fig. 2g), SEM (Fig. 2e) and PL (Fig. S7†) characterization. Notably, the PL spectra excited from the FTO side display a blue-shift from 532.7 nm of the control device to 528.0 nm of the DAP-0.2 tailored PSC (Fig. 4d), while the PL spectra excited from the air side shown in Fig. S7† show an obviously smaller shift from 532.7 nm to 530.2 nm, which convincingly demonstrates that the interface modification of DAP has a passivation effect on the surface defects of perovskite films in addition to the perovskite film quality improvement induced defect reduction.58,59 In addition, TRPL spectra of various devices were recorded to analyze the lifetime of photogenerated carriers, as shown in Fig. 4e, and the specific carrier lifetimes τ1,τ2 and the average lifetime, τave, are summarized in Table S4.†60 Apparently, the τave of the DAP-0.2 tailored PSC is obviously reduced from 0.78 ns for the control one to 0.15 ns, which further manifests the accelerated charge extraction and transport from the perovskite film to the modified ETL owing to the more perfect energy level matching and contact at the buried interface and the total passivation of TiO2 and perovskite defects, confirming the phenomenon of steady-state PL spectra and the μe ascent of the perovskite film deposited on the TiO2/DAP ETL.

Furthermore, the dark environment J–V curves of various devices, as shown in Fig. 4f, were also recorded to explore the accelerated charge extraction and transport and suppressed carrier recombination at the buried interface. As expected, the lower leakage current density of the DAP tailored solar cells than that of the control one demonstrates the decreased current leakage path and charge shunting loss for suppressing carrier recombination inside devices, which is mainly ascribed to the efficient charge extraction and transport caused by defect passivation, perovskite film quality improvement and interface energy level matching after introducing the DAP “double-sided tape” modifier. To better understand charge transfer kinetics and the charge recombination mechanism inside the PSC, EIS in the dark state was performed and images are depicted in Fig. 4g, and Table S5† summarizes the specific data of the fitted series resistance (Rs, corresponding to the real axis intercept) and charge recombination resistance (Rrec, related to the circular arc).61 Apparently, the lower Rs and higher Rrec for the DAP tailored devices in contrast with those of the control PSC demonstrate a boosted charge transport and an inhibited charge recombination in the former devices attributed to the improvement of interfacial contact, the descent of perovskite film grain boundaries and the passivation of interfacial imperfections after modifying DAP at the buried interface, which also verifies the charge transport process shown in Fig. 3b. As is well known, the carrier recombination seriously affects the performance output of PSCs, and in order to better explore the mutual relationship between them, the dependences of JSC and VOC on light intensities (I) were measured, as shown in Fig. 4h and i, and depicted according to the formulae JSC ∝ Iα (α ≤ 1) and VOC = nkTln(I)/q + constant, respectively,43 where α is a factor related to the bimolecular radiation recombination, n represents the non-radiative recombination factor dominated by defects, and T, k and q are the Kelvin temperature, Boltzmann constant and basic charge, respectively. For Fig. 4h, the α value closer to 1 (theoretical value) means the fewer radiative recombination along with the faster photo-generated charge separation and transfer inside the devices. After introducing the DAP “double-sided tape” modifier at the buried interface, the α value obviously increases to 0.991 of the optimal DAP tailored device from 0.937 of the control one, demonstrating the significantly promoted carrier separation and extraction in the former device owing to the more perfect energy level alignment and contact at the TiO2-DAP/perovskite buried interface, which is consistent with the phenomenon of PL and TRPL. Furthermore, for the VOC–I curves shown in Fig. 4i, the fitted slope value close to kT/q implies the less defect-dominated non-radiative recombination in PSCs.43 In comparison with 1.94 kT/q for the control device, the slopes of DAP-0.1, DAP-0.2, DAP-0.5 and DAP-1 tailored PSCs are reduced to 1.59 kT/q, 1.45 kT/q, 1.63 kT/q and 1.78 kT/q, respectively, which indicates the remarkably suppressed non-radiative recombination in the latter devices owing to the effective defect passivation at the TiO2/perovskite buried interface and the decrease in grain boundaries of the perovskite film after incorporating DAP. The restrained non-radiative recombination is further confirmed by the longer average charge recombination lifetime of the DAP tailored device than that of the control PSC as shown in the TPV curves in Fig. S13,† cross-checking the functional mechanism of DAP shown in Fig. 1 and the reduced Nt shown in Fig. 2g. These above results corroborate that the introduction of the DAP “double-sided tape” modifier at the buried interface accelerates charge transfer and inhibits charge recombination to improve PSC efficiency.
Long-term stability is another crucial indicator, in addition to efficiency and production cost, that affects the commercialization process of PSCs. Therefore, the long-term durable stability of the optimized and control devices was measured under 85% RH air conditions at 85 °C over 720 h and is depicted in Fig. 5a. As expected, the optimized PSC exhibits a more excellent tolerance against the harsh environment. Especially, compared to the 87% retention of the initial efficiency for the control device over 720 h, the DAP-0.2 modified solar cell maintains a significantly higher PCE retention of about 94%. Furthermore, the lattice tolerance of the corresponding perovskite films modified without and with DAP is also investigated. As shown in Fig. 5b, the intensity of characteristic diffraction peaks for both perovskite samples is slightly weaker after wet/heat erosion over 720 h, meanwhile, no new characteristic diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns are found, which is ascribed to the outstanding lattice stability of the CsPbBr3 phase.62 The water contact angle on the perovskite films (Fig. 5c) was further characterized to explore the underlying mechanism for stability improvement of the DAP modified device. Apparently, all the DAP modified CsPbBr3 films display a larger contact angle compared to the control sample, indicating that the former samples have the enhanced hydrophobicity for suppressing the decomposition of the perovskite phase by moisture erosion.63 Moreover, the improved quality of the perovskite film with fewer defects and grain boundaries is also an unmissable reason for enhanced stability of the PSCs with the DAP “double-sided tape” modifier.

Conclusions
In a nutshell, a versatile “double-sided tape” modifier of DAP is introduced at the TiO2/perovskite buried interface to boost the PSC performance. Specifically, the hydrogen phosphate ions and ammonium ions in DAP chemically combine with TiO2 and perovskite films to form a bridge between them and cause a simultaneous passivation of oxygen vacancies and negatively charged ion defects of TiO2 and perovskite films, respectively, which facilitates interface contact and reduces non-radiative recombination. More than that, a high-quality perovskite film with fewer grain boundaries and a perfect interfacial energy level alignment and contact are also formed after the introduction of DAP at the buried interface, leading to efficient charge transport and extraction. As a result, the optimized PSC with an architecture of FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/DAP/CsPbBr3/carbon acquires a maximum PCE of 10.31% with a high VOC of 1.621 V, compared to 7.58% for the control device. At the same time, the unencapsulated optimal device maintains excellent long-term stability after persistent attack by 85% RH air atmosphere at 85 °C over 720 h. This work provides a simple and valuable interface engineering strategy via exploiting “double-sided tape” modifier materials to realize high-efficiency and high-stability PSCs.
