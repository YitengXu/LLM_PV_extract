    , Accepted 13th October 2017First published on 13th October 2017AbstractPerovskite photovoltaics have attracted remarkable attention recently due to their exceptional power conversion efficiencies (PCE). State-of-the-art perovskite absorbers typically require thermal annealing steps for high film quality. However, the annealing process adds cost and reduces yield for device fabrication and may also hinder application in tandem photovoltaics and flexible/ultra-low-cost optoelectronics. Herein, we report an additive-based room-temperature process for realizing high-quality methylammonium lead iodide films with micron-sized grains (>2 μm) and microsecond-range carrier lifetimes (τ1 = 931.94 ± 89.43 ns; τ2 = 320.41 ± 43.69 ns). Solar cells employing such films demonstrate 18.22% PCE with improved current–voltage hysteresis and stability without encapsulation. Further, we reveal that room-temperature-processed perovskite film grain size strongly depends on the precursor aggregate size in the film-deposition solution and that additive-based tuning of aggregate properties enables enlarging grains to the micron scale. These results offer a new pathway for more versatile, cost-effective perovskite processing.

Broader context
The quality of perovskite absorbers represents a critical aspect of preparing high-performance solar cells. Room-temperature processing (no heating) also represents an important goal for reducing cost and improving versatility of the resulting devices. However, perovskite films derived from current-generation room-temperature processing underperform analogous films deposited using thermal annealing, in terms of solvent residue, grain size and minority carrier lifetime. Here, we demonstrate an additive engineering approach to deposit high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 films at room temperature, using a low-vacuum treatment. Micrometer-size grains and microsecond time scale carrier lifetimes in the resulting CH3NH3PbI3 films are successfully achieved by controlled addition of CH3NH3SCN and extra PbI2. Large grain size correlates with enlarged CH3NH3PbI3 precursor aggregates in the precursor solution, through SCN− coordination, while long carrier lifetimes arise from the synergistic effect of improved crystallinity and PbI2 passivation. Solar cells employing such films exhibit 18.22% power conversion efficiency, with improved current–voltage hysteresis and stability. Moreover, we reveal that room-temperature-processed perovskite film grain size strongly depends on the precursor aggregate size in the film-deposition solution and that tuning the aggregate provides an effective method to tailor perovskite film properties. These results offer a new pathway for more versatile, cost-effective processing within perovskite technology.

Introduction
In recent years, perovskite photovoltaics (PV) have achieved remarkable advances in device performance, from initial 3.8% power conversion efficiency (PCE) in 2009 to over 22% PCE in 2016.1–7 However, current highest-performance perovskite film deposition requires annealing at elevated temperatures (e.g., 100–150 °C) to obtain suitable crystallization and to remove solvent.5,6 Due to the sensitivity of perovskite films to annealing conditions, inaccurate annealing time/temperature leads to perovskite film degradation, resulting in decreased device performance and processing yield.8–11 When fabricating more complex devices such as all-perovskite tandem PVs, annealing temperatures used to prepare top perovskite cells can cause degradation of well-prepared perovskite layers within bottom cells,11–15 thereby hindering fabrication of tandem PVs targeting ultra-high PCE (e.g., >25%). High annealing temperatures can also lead to the melting or deformation of flexible (e.g., polymer-based) substrates and impede the application of perovskite technology in flexible devices. Moreover, added heating steps increase the payback time and ultimately cut into the economic viability of perovskite technology for large-scale production.
More recently, several room-temperature approaches have been reported for perovskite film deposition.16–21 Nevertheless, perovskite film quality from current room-temperature processing approaches underperforms the analogous films obtained with thermal anneals in terms of persistent residual solvent, small grain size (≤300 nm) and/or short charge carrier lifetimes. These issues arise from the lack of effective mechanisms to positively impact the film crystallization process. In addition to film quality, the film deposition steps for current room-temperature approaches are not generally suitable for device structures involving multiple perovskite layers, as in all-perovskite tandem PVs. For example, the required dipping steps (e.g., in diethyl ether or methylammonium iodide/isopropanol solutions) in current room-temperature processes can cause the degradation or cross-reaction of well-deposited layers in bottom cells during preparation of top perovskite layers.16–18 To fully benefit from the room-temperature process, the film quality and deposition process requirements should be simultaneously considered.
In this work, we demonstrate an additive engineering approach to deposit high-quality methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) films at room temperature. By using methylammonium thiocyanate (MASCN) as an additive to the precursor and a rapid vacuum-based drying approach, high quality MAPbI3 films are achieved. Despite the absence of heating, such MAPbI3 films possess high crystallinity, large grains (>2 μm) and long charge carrier lifetimes (τ1 = 931.94 ± 89.43 ns; τ2 = 320.41 ± 43.69 ns), which represent the best overall results among reported room-temperature film processing approaches16–21 and also comparable characteristics to state-of-the-art MAPbI3 films deposited with annealing steps.22 Unlike previously reported room-temperature approaches, our process requires no extended dipping steps that could cause degradation and cross-reaction during preparation of more complex devices structures, including all-perovskite tandem PVs. Moreover, our room-temperature MAPbI3-based PVs exhibit a best PCE of 18.22% (16.9%, average), with significantly reduced hysteresis and improved environmental stability over 1000 hours without encapsulation. To understand the origin of the outstanding film properties from the additive-based approach, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements have been used to reveal that the average grain size in room-temperature-processed perovskite films strongly correlates with solution precursor aggregate size and that micron-sized grains originate from similar-scale MASCN-facilitated aggregates in the precursor solution. The obtained high film quality coupled with room-temperature processing points to the potential for reduced costs and increased versatility for fabrication of high-performance perovskite optoelectronic devices.
Results and discussion
To obtain high-quality MAPbI3 films at room temperature, 40% MASCN additive and 5% extra PbI2 (both mol% relative to stoichiometric MAPbI3) were added into the MAPbI3 precursor solution, with dimethylformamide (DMF)/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) used as solvent. The precursor solution was spin-coated onto glass or glass/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/titanium dioxide (TiO2) substrates, and as-deposited films were quickly dried in a glovebox anti-chamber to form room-temperature MAPbI3 films (referred to as RT-MAPbI3). See the Experimental section in ESI† for full details.
Film characterizations
The top-view SEM image of a RT-MAPbI3 film (Fig. 1a) reveals that the film grain size exceeds 2 μm—i.e., a value that exceeds other room-temperature processing approaches16–21 and is as large as the grains in state-of-the-art MAPbI3 films obtained with annealing processes.22 In addition, the RT-MAPbI3 films exhibit good coverage without pinholes (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1, ESI†). According to atomic force microscopy images (Fig. S2, ESI†), the surface of the RT-MAPbI3 film has a roughness on the order of 20 nm. This flat surface and resulting reduced interfacial area should benefit device performance by reducing interfacial recombination loss.

(c) Optical (red curve) and PL (blue curve) spectra of RT-MAPbI3 film (PL excitation wavelength is 442 nm); (d) TRPL spectrum of RT-MAPbI3 film (TRPL excitation wavelength is 405 nm). The film for SEM, XRD and optical absorption was deposited on a glass/FTO/TiO2 substrate and the film for PL/TRPL was deposited on a glass substrate (corresponding top-view SEM for this film is shown in Fig. S4, ESI†). 
The XRD pattern (Fig. 1b) shows strong intensity for the MAPbI3 peaks, pointing to good crystallinity of the RT-MAPbI3 films. Furthermore, no extra peaks could be found beyond those for MAPbI3 and the substrate, indicating no solvent inclusion or SCN-related compounds in the resulting films. SCN− is a volatile species and expected to be removed during processing (the proposed mechanism is discussed further below). To verify this point, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling spectra (Fig. S3a and b, ESI†) show no detectable residual sulfur within the RT-MAPbI3 film, indicating that SCN- and DMSO are effectively removed during the vacuum pump process, despite MASCN and DMSO being added into the precursor solution. Moreover, a transmittance infrared (IR) measurement was performed on the RT-MAPbI3 film, along with (for comparison) a spectrum for pristine MAPbI3 (no MASCN addition) with annealing treatment (referred to as P-MAPbI3). As shown in Fig. S3c (ESI†), IR spectra of RT-MAPbI3 and P-MAPbI3 are essentially identical, further confirming that no SCN− anions or solvent remain in the RT-MAPbI3 films (or associated concentrations fall below the detection limit of the measurement). These results illustrate that the SCN−/DMSO is depleted from the RT-MAPbI3 films after low vacuum treatment, which is different from analogous reports that do not employ a vacuum-treatment process.23,24 Complete removal of solvent and SCN− anions in the RT-MAPbI3 films is beneficial because residuals of these species may influence film quality, leading to losses of optical absorption and conductivity, and also negatively impact film stability.
For optical characterization of RT-MAPbI3 films, optical absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy were performed (Fig. 1c), revealing good correspondence between optical absorption and PL emission features. From the time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectrum of a RT-MAPbI3 film (Fig. 1d), an average charge carrier lifetime (τavg) of 613.47 ± 65.61 ns is obtained from the relative amplitudes of the long-lived (τ1 = 931.94 ± 89.43 ns; A1 = 47.92%), and short-lived (τ2 = 320.41 ± 43.69; A2 = 52.08%) components of the charge carrier lifetime.25–27 For comparison, under the same characterization conditions, optical absorption and PL measurements were also performed on the P-MAPbI3 film (Fig. S5, ESI†). We can see that the τavg of RT-MAPbI3 exceeds the analogous value for P-MAPbI3 by ∼500 fold. The minority charge carrier lifetimes also fall into the same microsecond timeframe as the analogous values for state-of-the-art MAPbI3 films processed with annealing steps.22 The long charge carrier lifetime can be attributed to the synergistic impact of improved crystallinity from MASCN addition and extra PbI2 passivation.22,28,29
Photovoltaic performance, hysteresis and stability
To evaluate PV performance of devices fabricated using the RT-MAPbI3 films, solar cells were fabricated with a planar device architecture of glass/FTO/TiO2/MAPbI3/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD)/gold (Au) (see the Experimental section in ESI† for details). The typical thickness of MAPbI3 layers is ∼400 nm (Fig. 2a). Histograms of PV performance (Fig. 2b and Fig. S6, ESI†) illustrate that the PCE, short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) by forward scanning, over 28 devices with RT-MAPbI3 films, vary from 15.81% to 18.22% (16.92% average), 21.16 to 23.20 mA cm−2 (22.32 mA cm−2 average), 0.998 to 1.064 V (1.029 V average) and 70.09% to 76.94% (73.67% average), respectively. The best device yields PCE of 18.22%, Jsc of 22.29 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.064 V and FF of 76.83%. This performance level closely matches state-of-the-art MAPbI3 solar cells achieved with annealing steps with planar device structure,22 attesting to the fact that the RT-MAPbI3 films are of similar quality as state-of-the-art films prepared using thermal annealing methods.

Histograms of Jsc, Voc and FF are displayed in Fig. S6 (ESI†). (c) J–V characteristics, using a 0.1 V s−1 scanning rate, of the best-performing device achieved with RT-MAPbI3 film. (d) EQE (red curve) and integrated Jsc (blue curve) spectra of the best-performing device with RT-MAPbI3 film. (e) Steady-state output of the best-performing device with RT-MAPbI3 film under bias of 0.875 V. (f) PCE as a function of storage time for the best-performing device based on RT-MAPbI3 and P-MAPbI3 films. Jsc, Voc and FF as a function of storage time are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). 

Fig. 2c and Fig. S7 (ESI†) show the J–V hysteresis of the best-performing devices employing RT-MAPbI3 and P-MAPbI3 films, using the same device structure. We can see that employing RT-MAPbI3 helps to reduce the J–V hysteresis, presumably due to the enhanced grain size and long charge carrier lifetime. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum in Fig. 2d indicates high quantum yield for the RT-MAPbI3 device, resulting in an integrated Jsc value of 21.98 mA cm−2, which is in good agreement with Jsc from the J–V result. The steady-state output profile (Fig. 2e) shows output current, J, of ∼20.7 mA cm−2 and steady-state output PCE of ∼18.1% under bias of 0.875 V for this best-performing device. The efficiencies from J–V scanning and steady-state output are consistent, further confirming the reduced hysteresis behavior (Fig. 2c).
To test the environmental stability of the RT-MAPbI3 devices, the best-performing device was stored in air, under relative humidity of ∼20–25%, for 1000 hours without encapsulation. For comparison, the stability of the best-performing P-MAPbI3 device was also tested under the same conditions. Device performances as a function of time are shown in Fig. 2f and Fig. S8 (ESI†). The unencapsulated device with a RT-MAPbI3 film maintains a PCE of 16.34% after 1000 hours, which is ∼89.7% of its initial PCE value. By contrast, the unencapsulated device with P-MAPbI3 film only survives for ∼150 hours. Given that degradation of MAPbI3 films likely originates at defect sites/grain boundaries,30 the newly-developed room-temperature process simultaneously reduces the grain boundary density and defect density, thereby leading to significantly enhanced stability in MAPbI3 films and their devices.
Effects of additives on film quality and device performance
To gain insight into the role of additives on film microstructure and resulting PV performance, the impact of the additive level was examined. As shown in previous work, 5% extra PbI2 was found to be optimal in terms of device performance.22 To obtain the best MASCN addition level, different MASCN levels were added to the MAPbI3 precursor and these solutions were spin-coated using the same room-temperature procedure. Fig. 3a shows top-view SEM images of these RT-films with 0 to 50% MASCN (mol% relative to MAPbI3) in the precursor solution. The grain size for 0–50% MASCN additive level increases over the range of 0.1–2.0 μm, indicating that the MASCN additive plays an important role in the increased grain size.

The scale bar for the SEM images is 1 μm. (d) J–V characteristics of devices based on RT-MAPbI3 films by adding 5% extra PbI2 and 0–50% MASCN into the precursor solutions. All devices were measured with forward scanning direction at the scanning rate of 0.1 V s−1. 
According to XRD patterns (Fig. 3b), the unit cell parameters determined from full-profile Pawley fitting (Fig. S9 and Table S1, ESI†) indicate only minor lattice parameter variation, on the level of ∼0.2%, with no obvious systematic trend over the range of additive levels considered. The absence of significant change in unit cell parameters illustrates that addition of MASCN doesn’t significantly impact the MAPbI3 crystal structure. Fig. S10 (ESI†) shows the XRD peak FWHMs of RT-MAPbI3 films as a function of MASCN addition level, indicating that the 40% MASCN additive level yields films with the best crystallinity. By comparing the XRD patterns in Fig. 1b, 3b and Fig. S11 (ESI†), we find that (MA)2[(PbI3)2PbI2]·2DMSO (structure shown in Fig. S12, ESI†) exists in the RT-MAPbI3 films with 0–30% MASCN addition, but this phase does not appear for ≥40% MASCN addition levels.31 These results and the corresponding XPS and IR results (Fig. S3, ESI†) suggest that MASCN can facilitate the removal of solvent for MASCN additive levels exceeding 30% (possible mechanism to be discussed later). Complete removal of solvent is important in room-temperature-processed films because solvent residue can lead to optical and electrical losses. Specifically, Fig. 3c shows that DMSO remaining in the MAPbI3 films correlates with optical absorption loss. Fig. 3d shows the J–V characteristics of solar cells based on RT-MAPbI3 films with 0–50% MASCN addition in the precursor solution (parameters are listed in Table S2, ESI†). We can see that Jsc, Voc and FF are simultaneously enhanced with increased addition of MASCN. Such PV improvement correlates with the removal of solvent, increased grain size and improved crystallinity.
Proposed mechanism for RT-MAPbI3 film formation
To understand the independent effects of MA+ and SCN− from MASCN on the room-temperature MAPbI3 grain formation, methylammonium iodide (MAI) and ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) were used independently as additives. Fig. 4a and b show the top-view SEM images of MAPbI3 films deposited with addition of extra 40% MAI or 40% NH4SCN in the precursor solution. Adding extra MAI does not change the grain size, while adding NH4SCN results in grain sizes exceeding 1 μm with uniform film surface morphology. This result indicates that the SCN− anion, rather than the MA+ cation, plays the critical role in increasing grain size at room temperature. Furthermore, grain size progressively increases with increased NH4SCN addition level (Fig. S13, ESI†), confirming the relevance of the SCN− ion to grain size enlargement.
 Fig. 4  (a and b) Top view SEM images of RT-MAPbI3 films formed by using (a) 40% extra MAI and (b) 40% NH4SCN to replace MASCN as an additive in the precursor. All images employ a 1 μm scale bar; (c) DLS data of MAPbI3 precursor solutions with addition of extra 5% PbI2 and 0–50% MASCN. (d) The dependence of average film grain size on the average precursor aggregate size in the precursor solutions; (e) Schematic flow diagram of the room-temperature process to deposit MAPbI3 films and illustration the film formation mechanism. 
Given that there is no post-annealing step to accomplish thermally-assisted MAPbI3 grain growth, the significant film morphology change upon SCN− anion addition may directly originate from changes taking place within the precursor solutions. Since the perovskite precursor solution consists of precursor aggregates formed by molecular self-assembly32,33 and SCN− is a strong bridging group for coordination bonding,34,35 we propose SCN− can coordinate with Pb2+ to facilitate enlargement of the precursor aggregates up to the microscale before spin-coating.32,33 During the film deposition, these enlarged precursor aggregates arrange in an orderly and compact fashion on the substrates. With the assistance of gentle vacuum, the precursor aggregates crystallize and convert into the final grains, as solvent and volatile SCN− species are removed (Fig. 4e illustrates the proposed film formation mechanism). To verify this mechanism, Tindall-effect tests and DLS measurements were performed for MAPbI3 precursors containing 0–50% MASCN additive. All precursor solutions display the Tindall effect, while the solvent alone does not, illustrating that the Tindall effect is induced through the MAPbI3 precursor with additives (Fig. S14, ESI†). DLS spectra (Fig. 4c) quantitatively display the size distribution of the precursor aggregates in each MAPbI3 precursor solution, from which the average aggregate size (distribution peak) ranges from 0.3–2.5 μm with 0–50% MASCN addition. The correlation of the precursor aggregate size with grain size (Fig. 4d) demonstrates that grain size in the final films strongly follows from the precursor aggregate size. Meanwhile, the coordination of SCN− ligands may possibly reduce the activation energy for the grain crystallization,17,18 thereby enabling the precursor aggregates to transform to high crystallinity during a mild room-temperature vacuum pumping process.
In addition to the grain size/crystallinity effects, we previously mentioned that MASCN can facilitate solvent removal and that SCN− anions don’t remain in the final films. At sufficiently high concentration, SCN− likely reduces the interaction between Pb2+ ions and DMSO through Pb2+ ion coordination (i.e., SCN− out-competes DMSO for coordination sites), enabling more facile DMSO removal under mild vacuum conditions. In turn, we propose that SCN− reacts with MA+ to form volatile CH3NH2 and HSCN gases. Under vacuum conditions, these volatile gas species form and are continuously removed from the system, thereby disturbing the chemical equilibrium and finally causing MAPbI3 films to be depleted of SCN− during the vacuum pumping step. Another prospective pathway involves SCN− reacting with MA+ to form CH3SCN and NH3 gases.36 These gases are also volatile and can be readily depleted during the vacuum pump step. With one or both of these processes occurring, the precursor aggregates lose the solvent/SCN- and eventually form crystalline grains.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrate an additive engineering approach to deposit high-quality MAPbI3 films at room temperature, employing a simple low-vacuum processing step (compatible with low-cost processing). The as-deposited MAPbI3 films exhibit micron-size grains and microsecond time scale charge carrier lifetimes, high crystallinity and flat uniform surfaces. With such excellent film characteristics, the corresponding MAPbI3 solar cells show high performance (best PCE = 18.22% and average PCE = 16.92%) with low hysteresis and good environmental stability over 1000 hours. In addition, we establish the size dependence between perovskite precursor aggregates and crystal grains in solution-processed perovskite films and, through this understanding, propose a general additive-based mechanism for engineering grain size. Even though we only discuss the additive engineering approach for MAPbI3 films and room temperature processing, given the flexibility to independently tailor excess Pb2+ and SCN− levels using both PbX2 (X = Cl, Br, I) and MASCN addition, the approach should also be transferrable to alternative perovskite systems and film deposition conditions (e.g., perovskites with mixed anions, films processed with gentle annealing-based approaches). The additive engineering approach should therefore provide a new pathway towards more versatile, low-cost processing of high-performance devices with complex structures, including all-perovskite tandem PVs and flexible optoelectronic devices.

Broader context
The quality of perovskite absorbers represents a critical aspect of preparing high-performance solar cells. Room-temperature processing (no heating) also represents an important goal for reducing cost and improving versatility of the resulting devices. However, perovskite films derived from current-generation room-temperature processing underperform analogous films deposited using thermal annealing, in terms of solvent residue, grain size and minority carrier lifetime. Here, we demonstrate an additive engineering approach to deposit high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 films at room temperature, using a low-vacuum treatment. Micrometer-size grains and microsecond time scale carrier lifetimes in the resulting CH3NH3PbI3 films are successfully achieved by controlled addition of CH3NH3SCN and extra PbI2. Large grain size correlates with enlarged CH3NH3PbI3 precursor aggregates in the precursor solution, through SCN− coordination, while long carrier lifetimes arise from the synergistic effect of improved crystallinity and PbI2 passivation. Solar cells employing such films exhibit 18.22% power conversion efficiency, with improved current–voltage hysteresis and stability. Moreover, we reveal that room-temperature-processed perovskite film grain size strongly depends on the precursor aggregate size in the film-deposition solution and that tuning the aggregate provides an effective method to tailor perovskite film properties. These results offer a new pathway for more versatile, cost-effective processing within perovskite technology.
