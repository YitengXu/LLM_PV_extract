    , Accepted 15th October 2021First published on 18th October 2021AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid lead perovskite films are crucial in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, a solution deposition process rendered a polycrystalline feature to perovskite films with a large number of ionic defects on the surface and grain boundaries, which will serve as non-radiative recombination centers, limiting the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. In this work, D–A–π–A-type organic sensitizers (MM-3 and MM-4) with a quinoxaline moiety were employed to enhance light harvesting and reduce the trap states of perovskite films. MM-4 of the D–A–π–A system dye has a more coplanar structure because it contains a thiophene π-bridging moiety, which would facilitate electron transfer in molecules, enrich electron density on the terminal carboxyl group and provide good condition for coordination with undercoordinated Pb2+, resulting in the reduction of trap states and suppression of the non-radiative recombination in perovskite films. Therefore, there was a significant increase in the open-circuit voltage (VOC) from 1.02 to 1.08 V, and PCE increased from 18.91% to 20.31%. Furthermore, the long alkyl chains will enhance the hydrophobicity of perovskite films, and PSCs passivated by MM-4 exhibited excellent stability without encapsulation. It can maintain about 92% of initial PCE under 15 ± 5% relative humidity after 70 days and over 77% of initial PCE under 50–60% relative humidity after 550 h. We demonstrate that the D–A–π–A sensitizer can be another passivator for effectively passivating the trap states, which significantly improve the PCE and device durability.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention as promising candidates for the next-generation photovoltaic devices, due to the merits of high power conversion efficiency (PCE), low-cost solution-processed fabrication, easy fabrication of large-scale module, and excellent optical and electronic properties of perovskite materials.1–4 Currently, the certified PCE of PSCs has reached a record high 25.5%,5 which has exceeded that of polycrystalline silicon and copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), and is comparable to the single-crystal silicon cell. However, a solution-processed method will yield perovskite films with polycrystalline morphology accompanied by all kinds of trap states on the surface and at the grain boundaries.6,7 The existence of trap states will act as the centre of carrier recombination and limit the efficiency of PSCs.8 In addition, defects at grain boundaries and the surface are more susceptible to moisture and oxygen, leading to the decomposition of perovskites and unstable PSCs.9,10 Therefore, reducing the trap states is an effective way for improving PCE and device stability, and the interfacial passivation engineering has been widely adopted.
The defects of grain boundary and surface are mainly manifested as insufficient coordination of metal cations or halide anions, which can be induced by ion migration or oxidation of iodide anions.11 Consequently, the introduction of the passivator into perovskite films is available for passivating defects by forming coordination with undercoordinated sites. Among various passivator materials, Lewis acids or bases are a class of substances that have a particular effect on the specific defects.7,12 For instance, the defects with lone pairs of electrons such as free iodide ions and lead iodine anti-side defects can be passivated by Lewis acids.13 Fullerene (C60) and its derivatives are the most representative passivator of Lewis acids, because of their intrinsic electron attraction in fullerene spherical structures.14,15 Huang et al. introduced phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) into perovskite film, and the iodide-rich trap sites at the grain boundaries were passivated, resulting in a reduction in hysteresis and an enhancement in photovoltaic properties.16 However, Lewis bases usually function as electron donors, which usually contain atoms with lone pairs of electrons, especially nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms.17–19 Hence, molecules with special functional groups such as amino, amide, carboxylic acid, sulfonate, cyano, and carbonyl have been demonstrated to effectively passivate the defects of undercoordinated Pb2+ ions in perovskite films.20–26 Among them, the molecules with carboxylic acid (–COOH) have been widely used to modify perovskite films, which could crosslink the perovskite grain boundaries or assist in the crystallization of perovskites.27 Sensitizer is also one of the typical molecules with carboxylic acids and introduced into perovskite films as a passivator. Lin et al. confirmed that zinc porphyrin sensitizer YD2-o-C8 could anchor with undercoordinated Pb2+ defects and suppress charge recombination.28 Gao et al. employed D–π–A-type porphyrin derivatives as the passivator, which improved PCE from 21.04% to 22.37%.29 For the metal-free pure organic dyes, Han and his coworker introduced D–π–A organic dye AQ310 with a –COOH functional group into perovskite films, prolonging the carrier recombination time and enhancing VOC.30 They also designed different substituted phenyl units as electron donors to passivate the ionic defects, demonstrating that the passivation effect was increased with the electron density on the carboxylate moiety of D–π–A molecules.31 When an additional auxiliary acceptor was incorporated into the π-bridge of a D–π–A organic dye, the D–A–π–A configuration was obtained, has also been widely used in dye-sensitized solar cells due to their tunable molecular energy levels, broadened absorption region, higher absorption extinction coefficient, and stability enhancement.32 The auxiliary acceptor group between donor and π-bridge would be “electron withdrawing”, facilitating the transfer of electrons from the donor to the acceptor,33 which may increase the electron density on the carboxyl group and provide better conditions for coordination with undercoordinated Pb2+ defects.
In this work, the D–A–π–A organic sensitizers (MM-3 and MM-4) synthesized in our previous work34 were employed as the anti-solvent additives to enhance light harvesting and passivate the defects of the perovskite layer, and the effects of the dye molecular structure on passivation are discussed. It was observed that MM-4 with a high coplanar π-bridge can facilitate the delivery of electrons in the molecule and obtain a high electron density on the carboxylic acid group, which can effectively reduce Pb2+ defects, resulting in the improvement of open-circuit voltage (VOC) from 1.02 to 1.08 V, and PCE from 18.91% to 20.31%. In addition, by introducing D–A–π–A with long alkyl chains to modify the perovskite interface, the hydrophobicity of the perovskite film is significantly enhanced, which can prevent water from penetrating into the perovskite. As a result, the device passivated by MM-4 without encapsulation can maintain about 92% of initial PCE under 15 ± 5% relative humidity after 70 days, and over 77% of initial PCE under 50–60% relative humidity after 550 h. These results indicated that the D–A–π–A dye molecule MM-4 is an effective passivator for passivating the trap states, and the hydrophobicity of the perovskite film can also be strengthened, resulting in the improvement of the PCE and device stability.
2. Results and discussion
The donor–auxiliary acceptor–π–acceptor (D–A–π–A) organic dye molecules, named MM-3 and MM-4 are composed of 9,9-dihexyl-N,N-diphenyl-9H-fluoren-2-amine as a donor, cyanoacrylic acid as an extreme acceptor, different π-bridges of phenylene/thiophene, and the quinoxalinoid functionalities as an auxiliary acceptor inserting between donor and π-bridge (Fig. 1a). The synthesis of MM-3 and MM-4 started from 2,7-dibromo-9,9-dihexyl-9H-fluorene (1), the detailed experimental procedures are presented in Scheme S1,† and they were carried out via the Buchwald–Hartwig reaction, Sonogashira reaction, oxidation, cyclocondensation of 1,2-diamine and 1,2-diketone, Stille coupling reaction and Knoevenagel condensation. All experimental procedures are have been reported previously.34 To explore the effects of different structures of organic sensitizers on the electronic structure, the electrostatic potential (ESP) maps of MM-3 and MM-4 were calculated by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As shown in Fig. 1b, the negative charges mainly locate on the extreme acceptor cyanoacrylic acid group, which can coordinate with the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects. Moreover, MM-4 shows a more negative charge located on the cyanoacrylic acid group, resulting from the more coplanar molecular structure attributed to the smaller dihedral angle between the thiophene π-bridge and auxiliary acceptor, which is beneficial for electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor.33,35 Previous researches have demonstrated that the dipolar electron density distribution of the dye molecule with a more electron-rich electron-withdrawing end group of carboxylic acid will provide better conditions for binding with the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects, which indicated that MM-4 could effectively coordinate with the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects.31,36

To further figure out the interaction mechanism between dye molecules and perovskites, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of D–A–π–A sensitizers and a mixture of D–A–π–A sensitizers with PbI2 were collected (Fig. 2a and b). The MM-3 and MM-4 exhibited a stretching vibration of the CO bond at 1732 and 1721 cm−1, respectively. However, the stretching vibration of the CO bond for the MM-3@PbI2 and MM-4@PbI2 mixture was shifted to lower wavenumbers of 1726 and 1700 cm−1, which confirmed the interaction between the CO group and PbI2. The larger shift for CO peak indicated the stronger interaction between CO group and PbI2, confirming the stronger coordination of MM-4 with PbI2, which is consistent with the anticipation of electrostatic potential maps.12,37 Besides, the corresponding UV-vis spectra are exhibited in Fig. S1,† which further confirmed the interaction of sensitizers and PbI2. The CN located around 2220 cm−1 did not significantly change for all samples, indicating that the coordination of Pb2+ defects with the MM-3 and MM-4 dyes was formed only by carboxylic acid.

To explore the fact that D–A–π–A sensitizers have been successfully introduced into perovskite films, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping images for the perovskite film treated with MM-4 were measured, and the results are displayed in Fig. S2.† The presence of the S element (thiophene) confirms that the dye molecules were present on the surface of the perovskite film. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed to detect the surface coordinated state of Pb2+ in perovskite films without and with dye molecule passivation. As shown in Fig. 2c, the Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 signals for the control film are located at 143.6 eV and 138.8 eV, respectively. After passivating by MM-3 and MM-4, the peaks of Pb 4f shifted to a lower bind energy (143.4 eV for 4f5/2 and 138.5 eV for 4f7/2 of MM-3, 143.2 eV for 4f5/2 and 138.4 eV for 4f7/2 of MM-4), resulting from the increase in the electron cloud density of Pb2+ ions.14,38 These results evidence that MM-3 and MM-4 can coordinate with the undercoordinated Pb2+ effectively. Moreover, the larger binding energy shift of the perovskite film passivated by MM-4 was attributed to the higher electron density at the terminal carboxyl group of MM-4, which was consistent with electrostatic potential maps, suggesting a better capacity of passivation.29,31,39
To further evaluate the effects of MM-3 and MM-4 on perovskite films, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out and the corresponding patterns are shown in Fig. 2d. The diffraction peaks of perovskite films with or without dye molecule passivation are similar and matched with the typical α-phase perovskite. The main peaks at 14.0°, 28.3°, and 31.8°, can be indexed into the (110), (220), and (310) crystal planes of perovskites, respectively. The peak intensity increases slightly after passivation by sensitizers, indicating that the crystallinity of perovskite films was improved.20,40 After passivation by sensitizers, the intensities of PbI2 peak at 12.6° of perovskite films decreased, especially MM-4 could effectively coordinate with Pb2+ and the formation of PbI2 on the surface of perovskite films can be suppressed, which is consistent with the reduction of white plates in perovskite films, as presented in Fig. 3 (top-view SEM images).41 As shown in Fig. 3, after MM-3 or MM-4 passivation, the white plate (PbI2) on the surface of the perovskite film is reduced, and the surface of the perovskite film becomes smoother. The smaller root mean square value of the perovskite film further proves this through atomic force microscope (AFM) measurement (Fig. S3†). Although the grain sizes of the perovskite were not significantly affected after passivation by the dye molecules (Fig. S4†), the surface roughness of the passivated perovskite surface was significantly improved. From the cross-section SEM images, all of the functional layers are distinctively viewed, and the thickness of the mesoporous TiO2 layer, Spiro-OMeTAD layer, and Au layer was found to be about 200 nm, 200 nm, 150 nm, respectively, while the perovskite layers with or without treatment were 700 nm thick, illustrating that the grain sizes of perovskite films cannot be influenced obviously by passivation. However, after passivation with MM-3 and MM-4, the grain boundaries are reduced. These results indicate that the sensitizers only bind to the surface and grain boundaries of the perovskite films.30,42

To evaluate the effects of the passivation of sensitizers on the photovoltaic performance, the devices based on a n-i-p architecture (FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite/MM-3 or MM-4/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au) have been fabricated, and the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics curves for PSCs without and with passivation by MM-3 and MM-4 were measured under simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G irradiation. By optimization, the best performance devices were obtained at a concentration of 0.1 mg mL−1 of sensitizers (Fig. S5 and S6†). As a result, the J–V curves of champion devices are displayed in Fig. 4a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The control device achieved a PCE of 18.91% (JSC of 24.20 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.02 V, FF of 76.92%), whereas the devices treated with MM-3 and MM-4 dye exhibited PCEs of 19.40% (JSC of 24.66 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.02 V, FF of 77.52%), and 20.31% (JSC of 24.45 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.08 V, FF of 77.84%), respectively. Moreover, to verify the reproducibility of PSCs, 30 devices were fabricated and the average values of PCE were increased from 18.11% of control device to 18.94% of the cell treated by MM-3 dye, and 19.35% of the cell treated by MM-4 dye (Fig. S7†). Obviously, the PCE of the PSCs with passivation have an enormous improvement over the performance of the control device, which was mainly ascribed to the enhancement of JSC and VOC. The improvements of the VOC could be attributed to the efficient passivation of undercoordinated Pb2+ defects by dye molecules on the surface and grain boundaries of perovskite films, which effectively reduced the energy loss due to nonradiative recombination of the charge carrier.7,24,43 Compared with the device passivated by MM-3, MM-4 passivator has a greater enhancement of VOC, which is due to the fact that the MM-4 dye with a more coplanar structure can promote the transfer of electrons in the molecular structure and make it much more electron rich on the extreme carboxylic acid acceptor, resulting in better coordination between MM-4 with the undercoordinated Pb2+ defects, which have been confirmed by previous investigations.29 The corresponding schematic of interaction between MM-4 and perovskite is illustrated in Fig. 5, during the growth of perovskite crystalline, and the defects would generate at the grain boundaries and surface inevitably, especially undercoordinated Pb2+ arise from the I vacancy. When the perovskite films are treated by anti-solvent with sensitizers, the sensitizers with carboxylic acid group can act as a Lewis base and specially coordinate with undercoordination of Pb2+, resulting in the reduction of trap state density and improvement of VOC.31 A slight improvement of JSC after modification by sensitizers may be ascribed to the high absorption extinction coefficient of MM-3 and MM-4, and resulted in the enhancement of absorption of perovskite films in the region of visible light (Fig. S8†).32,34Fig. 4b shows the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and the integrated JSC values of different devices, and the corresponding integrated JSC values of control and passivated devices are 22.99, 23.80 (MM-3), and 23.38 mA cm−2 (MM-4) respectively, which are in good agreement with the JSC obtained from J–V characterization with errors below 5%.

To validate the reliability of J–V measurement, the steady-state power output of PSCs without and with passivation was further measured under an applied bias at the maximum power point. As shown in Fig. 4c, PSCs with and without sensitizers quickly reached the maximum steady-state current density. The current densities were stabilized at about 22.12, 22.21, and 21.79 mA cm−2, and the corresponding steady-state PCE of the PCSs were 18.55%, 19.06%, and 20.00%, respectively, which are close to the results obtained by the J–V measurements. The hysteresis effect of PSCs has been investigated by the J–V measurement at forward and reverse scans (Fig. 4d, S9, and Table S1†), and assessed by the values of the hysteresis index (HI). The HI values were observed from 22.83% for the control device reduced to 21.26% for the MM-3 device, and 6.12% for the MM-4 device, indicating that the carboxyl group of dye molecules can reduce the defect density of perovskites and hinder the ionic migration, alleviating the J–V hysteresis effect of PSCs.44,45
To further understand the reason for the increase in VOC, the hole-only devices (FTO/NiOx/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au) have been fabricated and the dark current–voltage (I–V) curves were measured. As exhibited in Fig. 6a–c, the I–V curves include an ohmic regime, a trap-filled limited regime (TFL), and a trap-free space charge limited current (SCLC) regime.46,47 The trap density could be calculated by the trap-filled limited voltage (VTFL), which is the onset voltage of the TFL regime, based on eqn (1):48 (1)where ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), εr the perovskite dielectric constant, q the elemental charge (1.6 × 10−19 C), and L the perovskite film thickness (L = 700 nm), and the control device obtained the VTFL value of 0.178 V, whereas, the VTFL values of the devices passivated by MM-3 and MM-4 dye are 0.154 V and 0.128 V, respectively. Therefore, the corresponding Ntrap values for the devices of the control, MM-3 and MM-4 were calculated to be 3.14 × 1015, 2.72 × 1015, and 2.26 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The reduction in Ntrap indicates that the trap densities of perovskite films were decreased, demonstrating that the passivation by dye molecules, especially MM-4, can effectively eliminate the trap states, resulting in the improvement of VOC.24,49 The same results have also been obtained by the dark I–V measurement of the electron-only devices (Fig. S10†).

Fig. 6d displays the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of perovskite films coated onto bare glass without and with dye molecule passivation. All of the samples exhibit almost the same PL peaks around 780 nm, but the intensity of PL was increased after the passivation of MM-3 or MM-4, indicating the suppression of nonradiative recombination. It has been reported that the nonradiative recombination is responsible for the loss of VOC.50,51 Therefore, the enhancement of VOC of devices with sensitizers, especially MM-4, could be attributed to the suppression of nonradiative recombination by the defect passivation, which is supported by the above-mentioned XPS and SCLC analyses.31,38 Meanwhile, carrier recombination lifetime was studied by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL). As illustrated in Fig. 6e, the PL decay curves were fitted with a double exponential equation, and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table S2.† The prolonged average lifetime (τ) from 325.83 ns for the control perovskite film to 448.64 ns for the perovskite film with MM-3 and 622.30 ns for the perovskite film with MM-4 was observed. The enhancement of PL lifetime suggests that there was less nonradiative recombination and a lower trap density in the perovskite films passivated by dye molecules, which are consistent with the above-mentioned results.52,53 To further explore the effects of the interfacial passivation of dye molecules on the charge transfer between the perovskite film and the HTM, the PL and TRPL of different perovskite films coated by the HTM layer were also measured (Fig. S11 and Table S3†). The stronger quench of PL intensity and shorter PL lifetime of the perovskite films passivated by dye molecules suggested the faster charge transfer between the perovskite and the HTM, which is beneficial for carrier extraction and better photovoltaic performance could be obtained.4,47,54
Furthermore, the dark J–V measurements were performed to study the leakage current (J0) induced by carrier recombination in PSCs. As shown in Fig. 6f, the control device displayed a J0 value of 5.48 × 10−6 mA cm−2, whereas J0 of devices passivated by MM-3 and MM-4 exhibited significantly lower values of 8.83 × 10−7, and 6.83 × 10−8 mA cm−2, respectively. A lower J0 value further indicates that the dye molecules, especially MM-4, could effectively passivate the defects of the perovskite film and then suppress the recombination of the photo-generated charge carriers in the PSCs.31,55 The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to investigate the interfacial charge transfer process and recombination behavior in PSCs. Fig. S12† presents the Nyquist plots measured at a reverse bias voltage under dark conditions, and a semicircle could be distinguished for different PSCs and the corresponding equivalent circuit included series resistance (RS) and recombination resistance (Rrec), which are related to the charge transfer at the interfaces of FTO/ETL/perovskite/HTM, mainly owing to the recombination of electrons and holes.26,56 The values of recombination resistance (Rrec) were increased from 14883 Ω (control) to 21721 Ω (MM-3), and 34900 Ω (MM-4) after passivation by sensitizers (Table S4†), manifesting that the devices with passivation can effectively suppress the carrier recombination, and the photovoltaic performance of devices can be improved.57
However, the stability of the device is another key issue for the practical application of PSCs, while the effects of the moisture resistance on the stability of perovskite have been found in several ways. Accordingly, the contact angles of water on the surface of different perovskite films were revealed, and the results are shown in Fig. 7a. The contact angles of water on the surface of perovskite films increased from 65° to 86° after modification by sensitizers with long alkyl chains, indicating the enhancement of hydrophobicity of perovskite films, which will prevent the permeation of moisture into perovskite films effectively.9,30,58 Moreover, the perovskite films were aged in a drying oven with 15 ± 5% relative humidity (RH) after 60 days, and their XRD patterns were measured. As shown in Fig. 7b, the content of PbI2 in the perovskite film of the control cell was increased and the crystallinity of the perovskite was decreased. On the contrary, the XRD patterns of the perovskite films passivated by MM-3 or MM-4 remained almost unchanged. After exposure to the condition of 90% RH for a week (Fig. 7c), the perovskite films passivated by MM-3 or MM-4 retained the black color and the obvious change has not been observed, indicating that the moisture stability of the perovskite was improved. The long-term stability test of the devices was carried out without encapsulation, and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 7d and e. When the devices were kept in a drying oven with 15 ± 5% RH for 70 days, the PCE of control device was decreased by 29% of its initial value, while the devices passivated by MM-3 or MM-4 can maintain about 90.5% and 92.3% of its initial value. Under ambient air with 50–60% RH, the devices passivated by MM-4 or MM-3 dye retained 71.4% and 77.5% of the initial PCE value after 550 h, exhibiting better stability than the control device (52.6% of initial PCE). Such an excellent stability of devices passivated by D–A–π–A dye molecules may be attributed to the fact that the defect density is reduced and the hydrophobicity of the perovskite film is increased.14,31

3. Conclusions
In summary, D–A–π–A sensitizers of MM-3 and MM-4 have been successfully introduced into perovskite films as passivators, and MM-4 has a strong interaction with undercoordinated Pb2+, which might be attributed to the more coplanar thiophene π-bridge of MM-4, which promotes the transfer of electrons from the donor to the acceptor and increases the electron density of the terminal carboxylic acid group. Therefore, the defects on the surface and at grain boundaries of perovskite films can be passivated more efficiently. As a result, the photovoltaic performance of the devices passivated by MM-4 has been obviously improved. The VOC was increased to 1.08 V, and the champion PCE of the device achieved 20.31%. Furthermore, the role of long alkyl chains of dye molecules on the surface of perovskite films has also been explored. The hydrophobicity of perovskite films passivated by MM-4 dye was increased and the permeation of moisture on the surface of perovskite films was prevented effectively. The stable devices can remain over 90% of its initial PCE under 15 ± 5% RH after 70 days, and over 70% of its initial PCE under 50–60% RH after 550 h. Therefore, the present work will provide a useful method for defect passivation of perovskite films based on the modification of sensitizers and the control of the electron density of terminal functional groups.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Materials
All the commercially available materials were used as received without further purification. HC(NH2)2I (FAI) and CH3NH2I (MAI), FK209-cobalt(III)-TFSI, Li-TFSI, CsI, PbBr2, and Spiro-OMeTAD were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. PbI2 (99.9985%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Chlorobenzene, titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate), 1-butanol, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and 4-tert-butylpyridine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Glass substrates with a transparent F–SnO2 (FTO) (14 Ω per square) layer were purchased from Wuhan Jingge Solar Technology Co., Ltd.
4.2 Fabrication of the PSC device
FTO glass was etched with Zn powder and then cleaned with a detergent solution, deionized water, ethyl alcohol, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. To form a compact TiO2 layer, 0.15 M of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution in 1-butanol was coated onto the surface of FTO at a speed of 2000 rpm for 30 s and then heated at 500 °C for 30 min. A mesoporous layer was spin-coated by a TiO2 paste (Dyesol, 30NRD) at a speed of 2000 rpm for 30 s and heated at 550 °C for 30 min. The perovskite films were deposited by a single-step deposition method from the precursor solution, which was prepared in a nitrogen atmosphere and the perovskite precursor solution was composed of 1.1 M FAI, 0.15 M MAI, 0.15 M CsI, 1.3 M PbI2 and 0.1 M PbBr2 in anhydrous DMF/DMSO = 4:1 (v/v). Then, the perovskite solutions were spin-coated onto the substrates at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 4000 rpm for 20 s, respectively. During the second step, 100 μL of chlorobenzene with or without dye molecules was dropped at 5 s before end, followed by heat treatment at 100 °C for 60 min. The Spiro-OMeTAD chlorobenzene solution (60 mM) mixed with 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine, 17.5 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethyl-sulfonyl)imide (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) and 29.0 μL of cobalt bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (300 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) was spin-coated (4000 rpm for 20 s) on the top as a hole transporting layer. Finally, the gold layer was thermally evaporated to form a back electrode.
4.3 Characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of the sample were measured using a Rigaku Ultima IV with Cu Kα radiation (1.5418 Å). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were obtained using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, Hitachi S4800). UV-vis transmission spectra were recorded using a UV-vis spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-2450). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were obtained using a SPA-300 AFM (Bruker) and the scanning range of the AFM images was 5 μm × 5 μm. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPL) of perovskite films were performed using an Edinburgh FLS 980 instrument with the excitation at 406 nm. IR spectra were recorded using a Thermo Fisher, Nicolet Is 50. XPS measurements were obtained using a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi instrument with a monochromatized Al Kα X-ray source in vacuum. The photovoltaic performance of PSCs was recorded using a source meter (Keithley 2400), and a PEC-L11 1.5 solar simulator with a 1000 W Xe lamp and an AM 1.5 filter (Peccell) was applied as the light source (100 mW cm−2). The J–V curves were measured from both forward and reverse scan directions, and the scan rate was 20 mV s−1; a mask with a window of 0.06 cm2 was utilized to define the active area of the devices. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was recorded using an instrument of PEC-S20 (Peccell). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectrum was measured on an electrochemical workstation (IM6, Zahner) and fitted using the Z-view software.
