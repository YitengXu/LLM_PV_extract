    , Accepted 14th June 2017First published on 15th June 2017AbstractOrganic solar cells (OSCs) based on a small molecule donor (SD) and a polymer acceptor (PA) exhibit low power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to the limited number of small molecule donor–polymer acceptor combinations. In this work, we employ a polymer acceptor based on the double B ← N bridged bipyridyl (BNBP) unit to develop SD/PA-type OSCs. With poly[(N,N′-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-diamine-bis(difluoro-borane)-2,2-bipyridine)-alt-(2,5-thiophene)] (P-BNBP-T) as the acceptor and 7,7′-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2) as the donor, the OSC device shows a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.08 V and a PCE of 3.50%. The VOC is ca. 0.3 V greater than that of other OSCs based on p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 due to the larger offset between the HOMO energy level of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and the higher-lying LUMO energy level of P-BNBP-T. The PCE of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/P-BNBP-T is higher than that of any other OSCs based on the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/polymer acceptor blend reported so far. These results indicate that the BNBP-based polymer acceptors are promising for high-performance SD/PA-type OSCs. While the as-cast p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/P-BNBP-T blend film exhibits low molecular packing order and large-size phase separation, processing with solvent additive 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) leads to continuous networks with small crystalline grains of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in the blend film. The resulting OSC device exhibits the best photovoltaic performance because of the improved exciton dissociation efficiency and charge transport ability.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on blends of electron donors and electron acceptors have attracted great attention due to their advantages of low cost, flexibility and light weight.1–7 The most widely used electron acceptors are fullerene derivatives, which suffer from weak absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions, high manufacturing cost and poor morphological stability. Recently, non-fullerene acceptors with strong sunlight harvesting capability and tunable energy levels have attracted considerable interest.8–12 Both small organic molecules and conjugated polymers can be used as efficient electron acceptors.
Based on the types of electron donors and electron acceptors, non-fullerene OSCs may be classified into four types, including polymer donor/polymer acceptor (PD/PA), polymer donor/small molecule acceptor (PD/SA), small molecule donor/polymer acceptor (SD/PA), and small molecule donor/polymer acceptor (SD/SA) blends. Among them, PD/SA-type OSCs have received the greatest attention and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has exceeded 12%.13,14 PD/PA-type and SD/SA-type OSC devices have also shown a PCE of over 9%.15–17 However, OSCs based on SD/PA systems exhibit a low PCE of less than 5% mainly due to the limited number of small molecule donor–polymer acceptor combinations that have been tried.18–24 The widely used polymer acceptor in SD/PA type OSCs is poly[(N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-1,4,5,8-naphthalenedicarboximide-2,6-diyl)-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)] (N2200), which suffers from a low LUMO energy level and a low open-circuit voltage (VOC).22–24 Moreover, N2200 shows small exciton diffusion length, which limits the current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) of the OSC device.25 Therefore, there is large room for PCE improvement of SD/PA-type OSCs provided that new polymer acceptors are used.
Recently, we have developed a new kind of polymer acceptor based on a novel electron-deficient building block, double B ← N bridged bipyridyl (BNBP).26,27 BNBP-based polymer acceptors exhibit tunable LUMO energy levels owing to their unique electronic structure.28 With optimized LUMO energy levels of BNBP-based polymer acceptors, PD/PA-type OSCs exhibit a large VOC of 1.0–1.3 V.29–31 In this work, we report SD/PA-type OSCs using a BNBP-based polymer acceptor poly[(N,N′-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-diamine-bis(difluoro-borane)-2,2-bipyridine)-alt-(2,5-thiophene)] (P-BNBP-T).26 The device based on the blend of P-BNBP-T and a commercially available small molecule donor, 7,7′-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2), shows a VOC of 1.08 V and a PCE of 3.50%. This PCE is much higher than that of any other p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/polymer acceptor based OSCs reported so far. These results indicate that the BNBP-based polymer acceptors are promising for high-performance SD/PA-type OSCs. The effect of active layer processing conditions on the blend morphology and OSC device performance is systematically studied.
Results and discussion
The chemical structures and energy level diagrams of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and P-BNBP-T are shown in Scheme 1. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and P-BNBP-T are −3.34 eV/−5.12 eV and −3.50 eV/−5.77 eV, respectively.26,32 The large HOMO energy level offset (0.65 eV) enables efficient hole transfer from P-BNBP-T to p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. The LUMO energy level offset is 0.16 eV, which is smaller than that (ca. 0.3 eV) required for fullerene-based OSCs. Moreover, the large offset between the HOMO energy level of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and the high-lying LUMO energy level of P-BNBP-T is expected to result in a high VOC of the OSC devices. Scheme 1c shows the absorption spectra of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, P-BNBP-T and their blend (2:1, w/w) in thin films. The absorption band at 690 nm is attributed to the aggregation state of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2.33 The as-cast blend film shows an absorption peak at 620 nm and a weak shoulder peak at 690 nm, indicating that the aggregation of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is severely suppressed by the polymer P-BNBP-T in the as-cast blend film. Upon thermal annealing and with 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) additive, the absorption peak at 690 nm of the blend film becomes stronger. This suggests that the aggregation of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in the blend film is greatly improved in the thermally annealed or DIO processed film.

OSC devices based on the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/P-BNBP-T blend are fabricated with the conventional configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/Ca/Al (Scheme 1d). We find that the optimized donor:acceptor weight ratio is 2:1 (Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI†). The device with the as-cast blend shows a VOC of 1.13 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 2.81 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 31.16%, corresponding to a PCE of 1.00%. The VOC is ca. 0.3 V greater than that of OSC devices based on the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 donor with fullerene derivatives or naphthalene diimide (NDI) or perylene diimide (PDI) based polymers as electron acceptors reported in the literature.18,21,25,32,34 This high VOC is due to the large offset between the HOMO energy level of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and the high-lying LUMO energy level of P-BNBP-T.26 The large series resistance (RS) may be responsible for the low FF and the poor diode quality of the as-cast active layer device (Table 1).

It has been reported that thermal annealing (T.A.) and the solvent additive can tune the active layer morphology of the bulk-heterojunction OSCs, which leads to high device performance.35–38 We found that thermal annealing and DIO additive can also be used to improve the OSC device performance of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/P-BNBP-T blend. As shown in Fig. 1a and Table 1, the device upon thermal annealing at 80 °C for 10 minutes shows a VOC of 1.07 V, a JSC of 6.80 mA cm−2 and an FF of 37.73%, which gives a PCE of 2.75%. When 0.4 vol% of DIO is added to the CB solution of the blend, the FF can be further increased to 44.67% and the PCE can be increased to 3.50%. This PCE is the highest value for the reported OSCs based on the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 donor and polymer acceptors.26,27 These results indicate that BNBP-based polymers are promising electron acceptors for SD/PA-type OSC devices. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the devices are shown in Fig. 1b. The device with DIO additive exhibits a maximum EQE of 39%. The JSC values calculated from the integrated EQE spectra of the three devices agree well with the JSC values obtained in the J–V scans.

Photon energy loss (Eloss) is defined as the difference between the optical bandgap (Eg) of the donor/acceptor materials and the eVOC of the OSC device (Eloss = Eg − eVOC).39 Typically, OSCs have large Eloss values in the 0.7–1.0 eV range, which limits the PCE of the OSCs.40 In this work, the Eg of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is 1.67 eV and the optimized device shows a VOC of 1.08 V, corresponding to a small Eloss of 0.59 eV. This small Eloss is consistent with PD/PA-type OSCs based on BNBP-based polymer acceptors, which is due to the high-lying LUMO levels of the BNBP-based polymer acceptors.26,28–30
To elucidate the effect of thermal annealing and the solvent additive on the OSC device performance, the blend morphologies of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/P-BNBP-T active layers were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Fig. 2 shows AFM height images and phase images of the active layers. The as-cast blend film shows fiber-like aggregates with widths of 50–80 nm and lengths of 300–500 nm (Fig. 2a and d). These should be due to the aggregation of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 rather than P-BNBP-T.26,33 As shown in the TEM images in Fig. 3, the dark regions are attributed to the small molecule donor p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and the white regions are assigned to the P-BNBP-T polymer donor. Fiber-like aggregates of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 with widths of 50–80 nm and lengths of 300–500 nm were also observed in the TEM image of the as-cast blend film (Fig. 3a). The large-size phase separation suggests the poor miscibility of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and P-BNBP-T, which may be due to the high crystallinity of the small molecule p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and the poor crystallinity of P-BNBP-T.28,33 Thermal annealing makes the fiber-like aggregates become larger but less connected, which can be seen in both the AFM images and TEM images. This is attributed to the enhanced crystallinity of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in the blend film after thermal annealing. For the blend film spin-coated with solvent additive DIO, a large number of small aggregates instead of large-size aggregates were observed in both the AFM images and TEM images (Fig. 2c, f and 3c). It has been reported that a small amount of DIO can induce p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 to form continuous networks with small crystalline grains in the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:[6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) film.33,41 This may be due to the limited solubility of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in DIO, which can enhance the aggregation and help the nucleation of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in the solution.42 Such a phenomenon is also observed in the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:P-BNBP-T blend. The connected crystalline networks with small domain size in the additive DIO processed film benefit the more efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport, which should be responsible for the improved device performance.36,37 In addition, the enhanced aggregation of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in the blend film with thermal annealing or solvent additive DIO is consistent with the improved absorption band of the aggregation state of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in the UV-Vis absorption spectra (Scheme 1c).

Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) was measured to study the molecular packing order in the blend films obtained under different processing conditions. The out-of-plane and in-plane GI-XRD patterns of the pure P-BNBP-T film and the pure p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 film are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The pure P-BNBP-T film exhibits weak diffraction signals, which indicates that the polymer is amorphous in the spin-coated film.26,28 In contrast, the pure p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 film shows sharp higher-order diffraction peaks at 2θ = 4.02°, 8.04° and 11.92° in the out-of-plane XRD pattern and a strong diffraction peak at 24.7° in the in-plane XRD pattern. The former can be attributed to the (001), (002) and (003) diffraction peaks of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, and the latter with a spacing of 0.36 nm can be described by the (141) plane of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, which corresponds to the π–π stacking between two adjacent conjugated backbones.33 These results indicate that p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is highly crystalline and adopts an edge-on orientation in the pure film. The out-of-plane and in-plane GI-XRD patterns of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:P-BNBP-T blend films are shown in Fig. 4. All the blend films obtained under different processing conditions show only the diffraction peaks of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. For the as-cast films, the π–π stacking diffraction peaks appear in both the out-of-plane and in-plane XRD patterns. After thermal annealing, the diffraction intensity increases slightly. For the blend film processed with solvent additive DIO, the intensity of the (001), (002) and (003) diffraction peaks in the out-of-plane XRD pattern becomes much stronger than the as-cast and thermally annealed films, indicating enhanced crystallinity of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. Moreover, the π–π stacking diffraction peak at 24.7° becomes stronger in the in-plane pattern but weaker in the out-of-plane pattern for the film processed with DIO. It means that p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 molecules adopt both the edge-on and face-on orientations in the blend films obtained under different processing conditions, but more p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 molecules prefer to adopt an edge-on orientation when DIO is used. In addition, the enhanced crystallinity and π–π stacking of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in the thermally annealed and DIO processed films are consistent with the UV-Vis spectra and AFM and TEM measurements.

To investigate the charge carrier mobility of the blend films obtained under different processing conditions, the hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the blend films were estimated using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The measured J–V curves and fitted SCLC curves are shown in Fig. 5. The hole and electron mobilities are listed in Table 2. The as-cast blend film shows relatively low hole and electron mobilities of 7.84 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.36 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. This may be due to the poor molecular packing in the as-cast blend film. The low charge carrier mobility leads to large RS and poor device performance in the as-cast film. Upon thermal annealing, the hole and electron mobilities improved to 2.33 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.48 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The improved hole mobility should result from the enhanced crystallinity of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in the blend films. When solvent additive DIO is used, the hole mobility is enhanced by about one order of magnitude and reaches 2.52 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. This is attributed to the formation of the connecting crystalline network and the higher molecule packing order of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. Compared to the as-cast film, the higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities in the thermally annealed and DIO processed films improve the charge transport and collection, which result in smaller RS and higher FF and JSC, and finally large improvement of OSC device performance.

The charge-transfer state (CTS) dissociation efficiency and light intensity (I) dependent J–V characteristics were measured to investigate the influence of different processing conditions on charge recombination in the OSC devices. The photogenerated current density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves were obtained to estimate the CTS dissociation efficiency. The Jph and Veff are obtained from the following formula: Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, and Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 and Va is the applied voltage.43 As shown in Fig. 6a, the CTS dissociation efficiencies (Jph, sc/Jph, sat, where Jph, sc is the photocurrent density under short-circuit conditions and Jph, sat is the saturation photocurrent density) are 19%, 53% and 56% for the as-cast, thermally annealed and DIO processed devices, respectively. The poor CTS dissociation efficiency leads to a low FF and JSC for the as-cast device. Though the CTS dissociation efficiencies are enhanced for the thermally annealed and DIO-processed devices, the CTS dissociation efficiencies of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/P-BNBP-T blend are still much lower than that of many high-performance OSCs (>90%).13 The low CTS dissociation efficiency may be the main reason for the moderate device performance of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/P-BNBP-T based OSC device. The relationship between JSC and I can be determined by the power law equation: JSC ∝ Iα, where α is the calculated power-law exponent.44,45 When α = 1, it indicates that all charge carriers are efficiently swept out prior to recombination. When α < 1, it suggests the occurrence of the bimolecular recombination, space-charge buildup and variations in carrier mobility. As shown in Fig. 6b, the α values of the fitted lines for the as-cast, thermally annealed and DIO processed devices are 0.96, 0.92 and 0.99, respectively. The increased bimolecular recombination in the thermally annealed device may be due to the much enhanced free charge carrier generation efficiency but less efficient charge sweeping out process. This is caused by the moderate hole and electron mobilities. The much higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities in the DIO processed device help the charge carriers quickly sweep out, which could efficiently suppress the bimolecular recombination.46

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated an efficient SD/PA-type OSC device based on small molecule donor p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and polymer acceptor P-BNBP-T with a high VOC of 1.08 V and a PCE of 3.50%. The VOC is ca. 0.3 V greater than that of other OSCs based on p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 due to the large offset between the HOMO energy level of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and the high-lying LUMO energy level of P-BNBP-T. While the as-cast p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/P-BNBP-T blend film exhibits low molecular packing order and large-size phase separation, processing with solvent additive DIO leads to continuous networks with small crystalline grains of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in the blend. The resulting OSC device exhibits enhanced photovoltaic performance because of improved exciton dissociation efficiency and charge transport ability. These results indicate that the BNBP-based polymer acceptors are promising for high-performance SD/PA-type OSCs.
Experimental section
Materials


p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 was purchased from 1-Material Chemscitech Inc. and used as received. P-BNBP-T (Mn = 25 kDa, PDI = 1.81) was synthesized in our laboratory.26
OSC device fabrication and measurements
ITO glass substrates were ultrasonicated for 10 min sequentially with detergent, de-ionized water, acetone and iso-propanol. The ITO glass substrates were dried at 120 °C for 2 h and treated with UV-ozone for 25 min. PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP Al4083 from H. C. Starck Inc.) was spin-coated on the pre-cleaned ITO substrates and then baked at 120 °C for 30 min. All the substrates were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box. The p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:P-BNBP-T blend (2:1, w/w) was dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB)/1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) (99.6:0.4, v/v). The solution was stirred at 80 °C overnight to ensure the complete dissolution in the glove box. Before spin coating, both the solution and ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates were preheated on a hot plate at 80 °C. The active layers with a thickness of 80–90 nm were obtained by spin coating the warm solution onto the preheated substrate. After annealing at 80 °C for 10 min, the active layer was transferred into a vacuum chamber. Finally, Ca (20 nm) and Al (100 nm) were sequentially deposited on the top of the active layer at a pressure of 2 × 10−4 Pa. The active area of the device was 8 mm2. The current–voltage (J–V) curves of the device were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G simulated solar light illumination provided by a XES-40S2-CE Class Solar Simulator (Japan, SAN-EI Electric Co., Ltd.). The EQE spectrum was measured using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd.) under the short-circuit condition at a chopping frequency of 165 Hz.
Hole- and electron-only device fabrication and mobility measurements
The hole and electron mobilities of the blend films obtained under different processing conditions were measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The hole-only device structure is ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer/MoO3 (7 nm)/Ag (100 nm) and the electron-only device structure is ITO/PEIE (10 nm)/active layer/Ca (20 nm)/Al (100 nm). J–V curves in the 0–10 V range were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter, and the mobility was obtained by fitting the J–V curves near the quadratic region according to the modified Mott–Gurney equation:  where J is the current density, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity (assumed to be 3), μ is the zero-field mobility, V is the potential across the device (V = Vapplied − Vbi − Vseries), L is the thickness of the active layer, and β is the field-activation factor. The series and contact resistance values (Vseries) of the device (10–20 Ω) were measured using blank devices of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MoO3/Ag or ITO/PEIE/Ca/Al.
