1. Introduction
Inorganic–organic hybrid perovskite solar cells have recently become one of the most fervent areas of research for efficient photovoltaic technology. In 2009, Kojima et al.1 first used inorganic–organic perovskite materials in solar cells achieving an initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%. Then, in 2012, tremendous progress was made to reach a PCE of about 10% whereby mesoporous nanostructures were employed.2–5 Since then, the PCE of the perovskite solar cells has rapidly increased up to 20%.6–9 In addition to their high efficiencies, these materials have also shown great potential in terms of low cost and a straightforward structure.10–13 As a result, flexible and light-weight cells are desirable in order to extend the applications of high-efficiency perovskite solar cells to flexible electronics, wearable electronics, buildings and other applications. Organometallic halide perovskite layers can be processed at low temperature (about 100 °C) and yield high-quality multi-crystalline films with high photovoltaic performance. The low-temperature processing is compatible with the flexible plastic substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) among other substrates. Therefore, the perovskite-based materials show promise for the fabrication of high-performance flexible solar cells.
To realize flexible perovskite solar cells, the other layers of the cells, including the transparent conducting electrodes and charge-transporting layers, should also be compatible with the low-temperature processing and are required to be mechanically flexible. Previously, flexible perovskite solar cells were assembled on polyethylene terephthalate (PET),14–17 polyethylene naphthalate (PEN)18–21 as well as willow glass22 using indium tin oxide (ITO) as the transparent conducting electrode. However, ITO has been shown to be mechanically brittle and prone to crack during the bending and therefore limits the flexibility of the perovskite solar cells.18 Compared with ITO, transparent conducting polymers have excellent mechanical flexibility.23 Metal electrodes such as silver also show great mechanical flexibility and superior electrical conductivity. They are appropriate as electrodes for flexible devices.24–26
As for the electron-transporting layer (ETL) in flexible perovskite solar cells, high-temperature sintered TiO2 that is typically used on the bottom electrode is not suitable for the perovskite solar cells on flexible plastic substrates. To avoid the flexible substrates being damaged by high temperatures (over 200 °C), low-temperature processed ETLs are required for the devices. Metal oxides nanoparticle TiO216 or metallic compounds such as Zn2SnO427 have been prepared below 120 °C. In addition to these, organic material [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) film is also an excellent ETL with low-temperature fabrication.28,29 However, the PC61BM film is generally applied to inverted device architectures. There are still challenges to utilize PC61BM as an ETL on the bottom electrodes in traditional architectures. (1) The PC61BM surface is hydrophobic. It is difficult to form high-quality perovskite films on the PCBM surface. (2) The low conductivity of the PCBM requires a layer that is thin enough for efficient electron transport. PC61BM is slightly soluble in the solvent of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which are generally used to process organometallic halide perovskite layers. The thin PC61BM layer tends to be washed during the fabrication of the perovskite layer.
In this study, we report flexible perovskite solar cells with a new device structure that includes silver as the bottom electrode on polyethersulfone (PES) substrates and a transparent conducting polymer as the top electrode. There is an n-doped PC61BM film as the low-temperature processed ETL on the bottom silver electrode. The dopant of stearyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride (SDBAC, chemical structure in Fig. 1a) can enhance the conductivity of PC61BM by three orders of magnitude up to 10−3 S cm−1, which enhances the electron transport and photovoltaic performance of the devices. A PCE of 11.8% was obtained for flexible, ITO-free, low-temperature solution-processed perovskite solar cells. The devices maintained 84% of the initial PCE after 1000 bending cycles at a bending radius of 6 mm.

2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the device structure of the ITO-free flexible perovskite solar cells (PES/PSSNa/Ag/PEI/doped-PC61BM/CH3NH3PbI3−XClX/Spiro-OMeTAD/hc-PEDOT:PSS) where PEI is polyethylenimine for work reduction,30 Spiro-OMeTAD is 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene, and hc-PEDOT:PSS denotes the highly conductive PEDOT:PSS transparent top electrode. The energy level diagram of the device is depicted in ESI Fig. S1,† which shows that the charge carrier collections in the cells are energetically favorable. Prior to the deposition of Ag onto the PES substrate, a thin layer of polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) was coated on the PES substrate to protect it from the solvents of DMSO that are used for processing the perovskite layer. Images of PES and PES/PSSNa before and after spin-coating the mixture of γ-butyrolactone (GBL) and DMSO (7:3 v/v) as a processing solvent for the perovskite films are shown in ESI Fig. S2.† The PES substrate was damaged by the solvent mixture, but the PES/PSSNa was well preserved during the spin coating. The PSSNa film could prevent the damage of PES substrates by the solvent mixture. To understand the possible damage of the PES substrates even with the Ag (70 nm)/PEI (3 nm)/ETL (undoped or doped PC61BM, 80 nm), the schematic of the PES/Ag/PEI/ETL pattern is depicted in ESI Fig. S3.† The solvent might penetrate the substrate from the edge of Ag, which led to low device performance and poor reproducibility.
The dopant SDBAC has a long alkyl chain and benzyl group (Fig. 1a), which enables it to have good solubility in organic solvents such as chloroform and chlorobenzene. Therefore, SDBAC and the host PC61BM can be dissolved and processed in the same solvent. The mixture of SDBAC and PC61BM in chloroform or chlorobenzene was found to be stable for a week or longer without any precipitate. Fig. 1b shows the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the device (top electrode of the hc-PEDOT is not included). The border between the different layers can be distinguished. The doped ETL is about 80 nm. It should be noted that a mild air plasma treatment is required to treat doped or undoped PC61BM films to increase the surface energy to obtain high-quality perovskite films on the top. Fig. 1c is an image of a fabricated flexible perovskite solar cell.
We first attempted to fabricate the device with undoped PC61BM as the ETL for flexible cells with the structure of the device as PES/PSSNa/Ag/PEI/PC61BM/CH3NH3PbI3−XClX/Spiro-OMeTAD/hc-PEDOT:PSS. The cell displays poor performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4.85%, a fill factor (FF) of 0.50, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.0 V, and a short-circuit current (JSC) of 9.64 mA cm−2, as shown in the current–voltage (J–V) characteristic plot in Fig. 4a. The J–V characteristic indicates that the cell is too resistive with a low FF that is possibly caused by the low-conductivity of the PC61BM layer. To evaluate the conductivity of PC61BM, the device with a structure as shown in Fig. 2a was fabricated.31 The channel length of the pre-patterned ITO bottom electrode is 1 mm created by laser ablation with a width of 15 mm. The resistance between both ITO electrodes approximately corresponds to the resistance of the undoped PC61BM film in the channel. The contact resistance between the PC61BM films and the ITO is not considered because of the long channel length of 1000 μm. The conductivity (σ) can be evaluated by the following equation: σ = l/(R × d × a)(1)where l and a are the length and width of the channel, d denotes the film thickness, and R represents the resistance obtained from the I–V measurement. As shown in Fig. 2b, the conductivity of the PC61BM film is calculated to be about 1.7 × 10−6 S cm−1. This is too low to transport electrons through a thick ETL.

To increase the conductivity of the PC61BM film, we incorporated SDBAC into the PC61BM. The chloride ion with relatively strong Lewis basicity acts as a strong electron donor, which leads to a huge increase in electrical conductivity. The alkyl ammonium organic materials such as tetrabutylammonium salts (TBAX, X− = F−, OH−, AcO−, Br−)32 and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)33 have been shown to be effective as n-type dopants to dope fullerenes via anion-induced electron transfer. By comparison with these materials, the SDBAC has a longer alkyl chain and benzyl group and has better non-polar miscibility with the PC61BM in organic solvents. To obtain an optimized conductivity of the PC61BM films doped by SDBAC, the conductivity of the doped PC61BM films with different ratios of SDBAC was measured. Estimated by eqn (1), the film conductivity increased to a maximum value of 2.2 × 10−3 S cm−1 (dopant ratio = 10 mol%), whereas the film conductivities were 1.2 × 10−4 S cm−1 (dopant ratio = 5 mol%) and 5.3 × 10−4 S cm−1 (dopant ratio = 15 mol%).
The charge-transport properties of the PC61BM and doped PC61BM films were tested side-by-side using a bottom-gate, top-contact field-effect transistor (FET) device configuration with Ag as the electrode. To avoid electron trapping caused by surface hydroxyl groups, the surface of the oxide dielectric was passivated with a thermally cross-linked divinyltetramethylsiloxane-bis(benzocyclobutene) (BCB) layer. The specific configuration is shown in Fig. 2c. Fig. 2d shows the evolution of the drain current (ID) versus gate bias (VG) at a drain voltage (VD) of 60 V. We could observe that the PC61BM device exhibits a typical n-type semiconducting behavior with an on–off ratio of 6.1 × 103 and an electron mobility (μe) of 9.3 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The 10 mol% SDBAC doped PCBM thin film demonstrated a small on–off ratio of 8.5 and a μe of 3.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The small on–off ratio indicates the intrinsically high carrier density in the film. With the conductivity (σ) of the films and μe, we could calculate the value of the charge carrier density (n) by the following equation: , where e is the electron charge. The n of the pristine PC61BM is of 1.1 × 1021 m−3, whereas it is 4.6 × 1024 m−3 for the doped PC61BM.
In order to illustrate if the doped PC61BM could contribute to efficient charge transfer, we tested the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL decay measurements. The samples with configurations of glass/CH3NH3PbI3−XClX, glass/PC61BM/CH3NH3PbI3−XClX and glass/SDBAC (10 mol%) doped PC61BM/CH3NH3PbI3−XClX were measured. As shown in Fig. 3a, a strong PL quenching effect could be observed when the films of PC61BM or doped PC61BM were inserted between glass and perovskite. In particular, the doped PC61BM film led to a stronger quenching effect. The time-resolved PL is shown in Fig. 3b. The samples of the glass/CH3NH3PbI3−XClX had a lifetime of 130 ns, whereas the films of the glass/doped PC61BM/CH3NH3PbI3−XClX exhibited a slightly shorter lifetime of 2.5 ns than the films of the glass/PC61BM/CH3NH3PbI3−XClX with a lifetime of 3.2 ns. The PL indicated that the charge carrier transfer at the doped PC61BM/CH3NH3PbI3−XClX interface was even more efficient than that at the pure PC61BM/CH3NH3PbI3−XClX interface.

The internal electrical properties of perovskite solar cell devices were further investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The structures of the devices measured were glass/ITO/PEI/PC61BM (or doped PC61BM)/CH3NH3PbI3−XClX/Spiro-OMeTAD/hc-PEDOT:PSS. Fig. 3c displays a Nyquist plot of the devices measured over the frequency range between 1 MHz and 1 Hz under 1 sun illumination at a forward bias of 0.8 V. Two distinct frequency regions can be observed: a small arc at high frequency and a large arc at low frequency. We fitted the experimental data with an equivalent circuit model from the previous investigation, as shown in Fig. 3d.34 The high-frequency feature is ascribed to contact resistance (Rco) mainly associated with the ETL/perovskite interface (since the perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD interface is identical), whereas the lower frequency element is associated with the recombination resistance (Rrec) and chemical capacitance (Cμ) of the system.34 The contact resistances and recombination resistances for the devices can be extracted by fitting the plots using the circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 3c. The device with doped PC61BM showed a smaller contact resistance of 2.9 kΩ and an increased recombination resistance of 8.8 kΩ compared to the device with pure PC61BM having a contact resistance of 3.7 kΩ and a recombination resistance of 6.3 kΩ, indicating a more efficient charge carrier transfer and a lower recombination rate in the doped PC61BM device. This is consistent with the conductivity and PL results based on the doped films.
Then, the SDBAC doped PC61BM with a dopant concentration of 10 mol% (highest conductivity) as the ETL was used to optimize the flexible perovskite cell performance. Fig. 4 shows the J–V characteristics of the cells on both glass and flexible substrates in the reverse scanning direction. Compared to the undoped PC61BM ETL, the 10 mol% dopant concentration significantly enhances the solar cell performance. On a glass substrate (glass/PEDOT:PSS AI 4083/Ag/PEI/PC61BM/CH3NH3PbI3−XClX/Spiro-OMeTAD/hc-PEDOT:PSS, the PEDOT:PSS AI 4083 on glass is used to enhance the adhesion of Ag on the substrates), the cell displays VOC = 1.08 V, JSC = 17.2 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.70, leading to a PCE of 13.0% (Table 1). On a flexible PES substrate, the device shows a comparable performance of VOC = 1.07 V, JSC = 15.8 mA cm−2, FF = 0.70, and PCE = 11.8%. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the flexible device is shown in Fig. 4b. The integral short-circuit current based on the EQE is 15.2 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the value measured from the solar simulator. Hysteresis is a typical characteristic of organometallic halide perovskite-based solar cells.35 Herein, we also performed the J–V characteristic scanning in both reverse and forward directions. As shown in Fig. 4a, the J–V curves of the cells show very minor hysteresis. In the forward scanning direction, the cell displays VOC = 1.06 V, JSC = 15.9 mA cm−2, FF = 0.67, and PCE = 11.3%, which are similar to the values obtained in the reverse scanning direction.

One of the most important characteristics of flexible devices is their operational stability against mechanical bending. To verify this, a cell was repeatedly bent around a rod with a radius of 6 mm. The value of the radius is exceedingly small compared with the aforementioned works on flexible perovskite solar cells. During bending, the device performance was measured repetitively. The effects of the bending cycles on the photovoltaic parameters are presented in Fig. 5. The curves showed that VOC was only marginally reduced through the bending tests. The FF remained consistent after 50 bending cycles and dropped about 3% after 1000 cycles. However, JSC decreased sharply by approximately 10%, which was the main factor for the decrease in the PCE. Although the reduction of the PCE reaches 16%, the devices were bent under such harsh conditions (with a radius of 6 mm for 1000 bending cycles). This demonstrates that the perovskite solar cells with a new structure have excellent mechanical properties.

3. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated ITO-free, solution-processed, flexible perovskite solar cells with a new device architecture where silver is used as the bottom electrode and a transparent conducting polymer as the top electrode. The cell is top illuminated through the polymer electrode. A low-temperature processed stearyldimethylbenzylammonium chloride-doped fullerene film was utilized as an efficient ETL. The dopant enhanced the conductivity of the PC61BM film by three orders of magnitude. With the new device structure and new ETL, the flexible devices on the PES delivered a power conversion efficiency up to 11.8% with minor hysteresis, which is comparable to the reference devices on glass substrates with an efficiency of 13.0%. The flexible perovskite solar cell displays good mechanical flexibility. The flexible low-temperature, solution-processed perovskite cells are scalable. Therefore, this study provides a promising strategy for realizing flexible perovskite solar cells.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Substrate preparation
Polyethersulfone (PES, i-components Co. Ltd.) substrates were firstly cut (1 inch × 1 inch) and adhered onto polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-coated glass substrates. PDMS was a mixture of base and a crosslinker (10:1, weight ratio, PP2-OE41, Gelest Inc.) and cured on a hot plate in air at 80 °C for 40 min. To protect the PES substrates from dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), a layer of poly(sodium 4-stryrenesulfonate) solution (PSS, MW = ∼200000 kg mol−1, Sigma-Aldrich) is deposited on top of the PES (plasma treated for 1 min) by spin coating at a speed of 2000 rpm from a 200 mg mL−1 deionized water solution. The thickness of the PSS film is about 250 nm. To enhance the adhesion between Ag and the substrates, PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083) was spin-coated at 3500 rpm for 40 s on glass. The films were dried at 100 °C for 20 minutes. Furthermore, the bottom silver electrodes with a thickness of 70 nm were evaporated on both the glass and PES substrates under high vacuum (<5 × 10−7 Torr) using a thermal evaporator (Mini-SPECTROS, Kurt J. Lesker).
4.2 Device fabrication

4.2.1 Perovskite device fabrication. 
First, PEI (0.1 wt% in isopropanol, Sigma-Aldrich) was spin-coated on the PES/PSSNa/Ag or glass/PEDOT:PSS AI 4083/Ag substrates at 5000 rpm for 60 s and then heated on a hotplate at 100 °C for 5 min. After this, a solution consisting of 15 mg mL−1 of PC61BM (Lumtec) with 10 mol% SDBAC in chloroform was spin-coated onto the PEI film at 3000 rpm for 40 s, following a thermal annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. The thickness of doped PC61BM was 80 nm. Then, the perovskite layer was deposited on the PC61BM films. Then, 206.7 mg of methylammonium iodide (MAI, 99%, Aldrich), 580.86 mg of lead iodide (PbI2, 98%, Aldrich) and 38.92 mg of lead chloride (PbCl2, 99.999%, Aldrich) were stirred in 1 mL of a mixture of GBL and DMSO (7:3 v/v) at 60 °C for 4 h. The resulting solution was spin coated by a consecutive two-step spin-coating process at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 4000 rpm for 20 s. During the spin-coating step, a drop of anhydrous toluene (approximately 400 μL) was quickly added onto the center of the films with a delay time of 28 s after the beginning of the spin-coating. The substrate was cured on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min. The spiro-OMeTAD hole-transporting layer was spin-coated onto the CH3NH3PbI3−XClX film at 4000 rpm for 30 s from a mixture of chemicals and solvents (80 mg of spiro-OMeTAD (Nichem), 28.8 mL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, Sigma-Aldrich) and 17.5 mL of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI, Sigma-Aldrich) solution (520 mg of Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile), dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene). All the steps mentioned above were carried out in a N2-filled glove box. Then, the devices were oxidized in a dehumidifying air-filled box for 16 h. Finally, the hc-PEDOT:PSS top electrode (around 700 S cm−1), consisting of 5 wt% ethylene glycol and 0.1 wt% superwet-340, was transferred onto the devices with PDMS as previously reported.36–38


4.2.2 FET device fabrication. 
Silicon wafers with a 300 nm SiO2 layer were bought from Tianjin Mingwei Company. To avoid electron trapping caused by surface hydroxyl groups, a 1 wt% BCB precursor solution in toluene was spun onto silicon oxide at 4000 rpm and annealed at 250 °C overnight. The total capacitance density measured from the parallel-plate capacitors was 11 nF cm−2. Then, solutions consisting of 15 mg mL−1 PC61BM with or without 10 mol% SDBAC in chloroform were spin-coated at a speed of 3000 rpm and subsequently heated at 100 °C for 5 min. Finally, the top contact electrodes consisting of Ag (30 nm) were evaporated under high vacuum (10−4 Pa) through a shadow mask. The channel length (L) and width (W) of the transistors were 50 μm and 1000 μm, respectively. The FETs were characterized with a Keithley 4200 SCS with the assistance of a probe station system under a vacuum of 1.3 × 10−3 Pa. The field-effect mobility was calculated from the linear fit of (ID)1/2vs. VG in the saturation regime.

4.3 Film and device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of all devices were measured using a Keithley 2400 source-measure unit. The cells were illuminated using a Newport solar simulator at a calibrated intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) test was performed by a standard system using a 150 W xenon lamp (Oriel) fitted with a monochromator (Cornerstone 74004) as a monochromatic light source. The film thickness was measured by a step profiler (Dektak XT, Bruker Corp.). The cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) test was conducted by a high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscope (FEI Nova Nano-SEM 450). The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements were measured by a fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh Instruments FLS920) with a 150 W Xe lamp as an excitation source at 450 nm. Time-resolved PL decay spectra were obtained using a Delta Flex Fluorescence Lifetime System monitored at 770 nm.
