    , Accepted 9th November 2021First published on 10th November 2021AbstractProtonic ceramic electrochemical cells (including fuel cells (PCFCs) and electrolysis cells (PCECs)) are positioned as an eco-friendly means for realizing energy/chemical conversion at low (below 500 °C) and intermediate (500–800 °C) temperatures; as a result, R&D of PCFCs and PCECs are compatible with hydrogen energy and CO2 utilization programs that play an increasing role in global environmental practice. However, along with ionic transport, the majority of proton-conducting ceramic materials also exhibit electronic transport under oxidizing conditions and elevated temperatures. This feature negatively affects the performance of cells due to the short-circuit effect leading to a reduction in faradaic and energy efficiencies. In response, in order to achieve a compromise between high performance and high efficiency, the present review article aims at revealing the main factors contributing to undesirable electronic transport of materials used in PCFCs and PCECs, as well as possible solutions leading to its suppression for improving their efficiency.

Broader context
Protonic ceramic cells belong to a hot research topic in the electrochemical energy field, since they can provide a wide range of functionalities for current demands of industry, including electricity generation in protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs), hydrogen production in protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs), varies conversion processes in protonic ceramic electrochemical reformers (PCERs). Despite of many paramount results reached, PCFCs, PCECs, and PCERs suffer from electronic conductivity, which is a natural sign of the-state-of-the-art proton-conducting ceramic electrolytes. There is a few strategies to diminish undesirable electronic conductivity; these strategies lie on tailoring chemical compositions of the electrolytes or varying external (technological) factors. The current work overviews the mentioned strategies in detail, acting a starting point for designing modernized electrochemical systems for energy conversion and electrochemical purposes. This work is assumed to be a great importance for chemists, researchers in energy and electrochemistry fields, high school professors and students, since it first gives summarized results on electron transport in proton-conducting materials and related electrochemical cells.

1 Introduction
Humanity is currently facing new challenges presented by global climate change and the depletion of non-renewable energy sources. Possible solutions include searching for new and effective energy conversion methods, reducing the negative impact of existing technologies, as well as formulating innovative proposals to achieve a rational balance between economic development and ecological sustainability (eco-eco balance).1–5 In this regard, many countries are involved in developing a fresh approach to existing energy problems, including programs for the development of hydrogen energy6–10 and reduction of carbon-based environmental loads.11–15
In order to address and solve the stated issues, one of the most promising approaches consists in a group of electrochemical technologies that includes intermediate- and high-temperature solid oxide technologies, which are of considerable interest due to their high energy conversion efficiency, operational flexibility, and scalability.16–18 Research studies in the area of solid oxide electrochemistry are currently numbered in thousands of publications annually (Fig. 1). To assess the scale of the research carried out, it can be noted that solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), are ranked in second place (∼20%) after proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMs, PEMFCs), which make up 30% of the entire fuel cell-related research effort.

In order to meet strict requirements for the reliable long-term operation of solid oxide electrochemical devices, a general tactic of lowering their working temperatures has been proposed.19–24 This allows various degradation issues associated with undesirable microstructural changes and chemical interaction processes to be mitigated. Utilizing proton-conducting materials (PCMs) instead of common oxygen-ionic electrolytes is a rational way for achieving the high performance and efficiency of electrochemical devices at lowered operational temperatures. The latter is due to the low activation energy of proton conduction resulted by relatively low mass and size of protons, ensuring rapid ionic transport compared with more massive oxygen ions, especially at temperatures below 600 °C.25–28
Proton transportation is a unique property of some oxide materials; in most cases, protons appear as inherent defect particles upon the interaction of oxygen vacancies with hydrogen-containing gases at elevated temperatures. Since perovskite structures can achieve a high level of proton concentrations, due to their chemical and structural features, this class of materials forms a convenient basis for model and applied systems. Although, other classes of oxides (Ruddlesden–Popper, double perovskite, fergusonite/scheelite structures) also display proton transport, they concede to perovskite-structured phases in terms of achieving both high absolute levels and contributions of proton conductivity.29,30 Due to this fact, BaCeO3, BaZrO3 or their solid solutions (BaCeO3–BaZrO3 or Ba(Ce,Zr)O3) represent the most frequently-used basic oxides31–36 for designing electrolyte membranes used in protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs), protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs), protonic ceramic converters (PCCs), protonic ceramic pumps (PCPs), and protonic ceramic sensors (PCSs). As can be seen from Fig. 1, research activity in this field accounts for ∼5% from a common direction associated with SOFCs and SOECs, and ∼20% from low-temperature trends.
Along with the mentioned advantages of protons over oxygen-ions, PCMs exhibit detrimental non-ionic (n- and/or p-type electronic) transport. As is well-known, a mixed type of conductivity is highly desirable for electrode systems in order to promote electrochemically reductive and oxidative reactions occurring in PCM-based electrochemical devices with the participation of oxygen, hydrogen, steam, and electrons.37 In addition, so-called mixed ionic-electronic conductors (MIECs) can be applied for non-electrode membrane reactors when both internal ionic and electronic fluxes are purposefully governed.38–41 However, the electronic conductivity of electrolyte membranes should be as minimized as far as possible in order to support high-efficient energy conversion processes occurring in PCFCs and PCECs.42,43 While the effects of electronic leakage on the performance of solid oxide electrochemical devices have been quite well analyzed in the case of oxygen-ionic electrolytes,43,44 the related electrochemical processes in the PCMs-based systems are more difficult due to the additional quota of protonic conductivity, which takes place along with electronic and oxygen-ionic conductivities. This review was prepared with the aim of identifying factors affecting the electron transport of PCMs along with strategies for minimizing undesirable electron conductivity. In order to reveal clear relationships between nano-, micro- and macro-functions, we thoroughly discussed basic properties of PCMs, including their defect structure (Section 2), transport properties (Sections 3 and 4), theoretical aspects of modelling performance & efficiency of PCFCs and PCECs (Section 5), as well as direct experimental results for actual lab-scale cells (Section 6).
2 Quasi-chemical description of proton-conducting materials
In general, PCMs are not purely single-ionic electrolytes, since oxygen-ionic transport as well as non-ionic (electronic) transport exists simultaneously at the certain conditions. According to the formalism of defect notation, both oxygen- and proton conductivities depend on oxygen vacancies, which appear in the structure according to an acceptor-doping approach. For the ABO3 perovskite-structured materials, such a doping with an M-element initiates the appearance of oxygen vacancies due to a charge compensation mechanism: (1)
The migration of oxygen vacancies in the perovskite structure results in oxygen-ionic transport, which dominates, for example, for the conventional oxygen-ionic electrolytes based on ZrO2, Bi2O3, CeO2, LaAlO3, LaGaO3.19,45–47 However, proton transport can also dominate over other charge carriers due to features of crystal structures. In this case, protons are formed due to a dissociative water adsorption mechanism resulting in the oxygen vacancies being filled with steam and the subsequent formation of protons localized at the oxygen-sites:48 (2)Here Kw is the equilibrium constant of protons formation: (3)Since this reaction is exothermic in nature, protons exist in the structure in a meaningful quantity at relatively low temperatures. Further heating leads to a shift in the equilibrium of this reaction to the left and, correspondingly, a decrease in the concentration of protons. Therefore, according to this consideration, proton transport for some oxide systems takes place at relatively low temperatures and high steam concentrations in a surrounding atmosphere, while oxygen-ionic transport starts to be a dominating factor at higher temperatures and dryer conditions.
Along with ionic conductivities, the PCMs might display n-type and/or p-type electronic conductivities,49,50 both of which are governed by oxygen partial pressure (pO2). The n-type electronic conductivity appears in reducing atmospheres (for example, wet H2, CO + CO2, H2/N2), when an oxide equilibrates with a gas phase desorbing oxygen: (4)Here, Kn is the equilibrium constant of electron disordering: (5)where n is the concentration of electrons (n = [e′]).
Significantly, these reducing conditions are indeed realized in real operations of electrochemical devices: in the anode side for PCFCs and the cathode side for PCECs. However, under typically achieved experimental conditions of PCFCs and PCECs, n-type transport is exhibited by a limited range of PCMs. Conversely, the realization of p-type transport for oxidizing conditions is a natural property of most PCMs. This is formed due to oxygen being trapped by oxygen vacancies, leading to the appearance of electronic holes (h˙): (6)Here Kp is the equilibrium constant of electronic hole formation. Eqn (6) corresponds to delocalized (free) electron holes, while the localized form of holes  is also confirmed:51,52.
Using the equilibrium constant of this reaction, the relation between concentration of electron holes and pO2 can be expressed as follows: (7)
In principle, the described defect interaction is similar to that of conventional complex oxide systems:53,54 the concentrations of electrons and holes depend on the pO2 variation in the power laws of −1/4 and 1/4, respectively. However, the concentrations of existing defects in the PCMs also depend on water vapour pressure, pH2O (see eqn (2)); therefore, the concentration of holes and electrons are also a function of pH2O. In the literature, the following mathematical relations can be found:48,55 (8) (9) (10) (11)where Kpn is the equilibrium constant of the electron interactions: Kpn = pn(12)and  in eqn (10) and (11) is equal to (13)Eqn (8) and (10) for hole concentration and eqn (9) and (11) for electron concentration show close relationships. Differences consist in the fact that the latter equations account for oxygen mass balance (eqn (14)),48 while the former do not consider it.55 (14)
Along with equations of defect interactions and ion site balance, an electroneutrality condition should also be taken into account. A general case of this attains the following form: (15)
Depending on the external conditions, this equation can be converted to the particular cases (see Table 1) when concentrations of several defects prevail over the concentrations of other defects. As can be seen from these data, electronic transport in PCMs occurs at relatively high temperatures (typically above 500 °C). This temperature range intersects with that of dominating proton conductivity (400–900 °C); therefore, electronic transport also affects the electrochemical activity of PCMs and corresponding cells when they operate in the intermediate-temperature range.

3 Determination of electronic conductivity with a background of ionic conductivity
As can be seen from Table 1, PCMs can simultaneously conduct oxygen-ions, protons, and electrons (or electron holes). Determining the correct separation of each transport participant involves the use of complex methodological techniques involving special equipment. Most of these techniques can be used in the case of comparable values of partial conductivities, while considerable differences in conductivity magnitudes might cause measurement errors. Below we consider a number of experimental techniques that allow the electronic conductivity to be separated from the ionic (oxygen-ionic and protonic) components.
3.1. Conductivity measurements depending on oxygen partial pressure
One of the most reliable and simple methods to estimate the level and contribution of the electronic conductivity is the measurement of total conductivity upon the pO2 variation. Generally, the total conductivity represents a sum of all constituent partial conductivities, which can be expressed through the corresponding mobility and concentration of charge carriers: (16)
Here, e is the electron charge, while zj, μj, and cj are the unit charge, mobility and relative concentration of charge carriers (j), respectively: j = n (electrons), p (holes), O (oxygen-ions), H (protons). The relative concentrations of defects (per unit cell) were obtained as a product of the following terms: (17)where Vm is the molar volume of the perovskite structure and Na is Avogadro's number.
Assuming that (i) the variation of both oxygen-ionic and protonic concentrations is insignificant with the pO2 change and (ii) the concentrations of electrons and holes are pO2-dependent parameters (eqn (8)–(11)), the following empirical equation can be derived: (18)Here, σn,o and σp,o are the electron and hole conductivities determined at a standard condition (pO2 = 1 atm).
Depending on the chemical features of complex oxides, various combinations of partial terms of eqn (18) are possible (see Fig. 2a). For example, doped Ti-based oxides (CaTiO3,56 SrTiO3,57 BaTiO3, ref. 58), Fe-based oxides (SrFeO3,59 BaFeO3, ref. 60) and their solid-state solutions (SrTi1−xFexO3−δ, ref. 61) display a classical cup-type of logσtotal–logpO2 dependences under a reasonable pO2 range (from 10−25 to 1 atm at 600–1000 °C). Many perovskite-related PCMs (i.e., oxides based on BaCeO3,62 BaZrO3,63 LaYO3,64 and LaYbO3, ref. 65 and 66) exhibit ionic conductivity under reducing atmospheres along with the p-type conductivity that appears under oxidizing conditions. The fluorite oxides of the CeO2 family, conversely, are purely ionic conductors at oxygen-rich atmospheres, but display an additional n-type conduction behavior under reducing conditions.43,53,67 Finally, ZrO268–70 and LaGaO371,72 electrolytes can be considered as unipolar oxygen-conducting materials offering negligible electronic transport in wide ranges of T and pO2.
 Fig. 2  Total conductivity measurements depending on pO2 variation: (a) possible forms of logσtotal–logpO2 dependences; (b) approaches for the creation of the needed pO2 values corresponding to oxidizing and reducing conditions; (c) principal scheme of an electrochemical cell for recording the logσtotal–logpO2 dependences. 
The logσtotal–logpO2 dependences can be experimentally obtained in two common ways: creating specific gas mixtures with strictly known pO2 and utilizing pO2-regulated electrochemical cells.
The first approach is based on mixing gases that can create the desirable pO2 values (Fig. 2b). To set pO2 in a range from 10−3 to 1 atm, oxygen or air can be mixed with an inert gas (N2, Ar, He) at appropriate flow rate ratios determined using gas flowmeters. Although setting lower pO2 levels (10−5–10−4 tm) is possible in principle, a high error can be admitted. In order to create very low pO2 values, gases with bounded oxygen should be used, e.g., CO + CO2, H2 + H2O. The latter gas mixture is most convenient, since it requires only hydrogen and steam created using a moisturizer (water bubbler, steam generator). Moreover, most proton-conducting compounds are stable under wet hydrogen. In this case, pO2 can be calculated according to the equilibrium of steam dissociation (KH2O): (19)as follows: (20)Here, KH2O is the stable constant depending on temperature. In case of a two-component gas mixture of H2O/H2, this equation can be simplified: (21)
Therefore, by setting different temperatures of the moisturizer and conductivity measurements, it is possible to govern various humidification levels in hydrogen and the equilibrium pO2 levels for the corresponding gas mixtures, respectively. In detail, using H2 + H2O gas mixtures, a pO2 range of 10−30–10−10 atm can be precisely fixed. Despite the apparent simplicity of the gas mixing method, some difficulties exist:
• In the case of highly moisturized gases, water condensation should be avoided across the entire supplied gas system; otherwise, no stable pO2 is provided.
• The oxidizing and reducing gas mixtures cover a wide range of pO2, from 10−30–10−10 to 10−5 to 1 atm, respectively, depending on measurement temperature and steam concentration in hydrogen. However, this approach does not allow intermediate pO2 values (10−10–10−5 atm) to be set due to the weak thermodynamic stability of gases in terms of maintaining their compositions.
The second approach (Fig. 2c) proposes to use a special cell made of an oxygen-ionic electrolyte (for example, YSZ) and composed of an oxygen sensor and an oxygen pump; the former allows detection of pO2 according to the Nernst's law (eqn (22)), while the latter enables the pumping of oxygen according to the Faraday's law (eqn (23)). The operation principles of oxygen sensors/pumps can be found elsewhere.73,74 (22) (23)Here, R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, F is the Faraday's constant, p′O2 and p′′O2 are the oxygen partial pressures inside and outside of the electrochemical cell, I is the applied current, τ is the time if current applied.
After placing a tested ceramic sample in such a cell, the inside space of the cell is isolated from the external environment. When an equilibrium is reached prior to carrying out the measurements (p′O2 = p′′O2, I = 0 A), a current is passed through the pump to initiate the oxygen pumping-out process. Following the created pO2 difference, the reading of the sensor starts to deviate from null to achieve a steady-state condition for a certain period of time. In contrast to the previous approach, this allows the detection and setting of intermediate pO2 values. Nevertheless, it also has some limitations:
• The pO2 range is limited by a reducing boundary (∼10−22–10−20 atm) due to features of the apparatus. Therefore, the creation of lower pO2 values involves particular challenges.
• Oxygen pumping-out occurs from an initial atmosphere. After all the free oxygen is pumped out, bounded oxygen also starts to be pumped-out for reasons of equilibrium. This leads to a decomposition of oxygen-containing gases – for example, H2O, which is a hydration-determined parameter of PCMs. Therefore, in a reducing media, pH2O changes with variation in pO2.
• The relatively high temperatures (as a rule, above 600 °C) at which electrochemical pump and sensors operate prevent experiments from being carried out at lower temperatures.
In conclusion of this subsection, the following features can be stated for the conductivity measurements depending on oxygen partial pressure:
• The logσtotal–logpO2 dependences cover almost the entire range of experimental conditions realized in protonic ceramic electrochemical cells, starting with pure oxygen (or air) and ending with wet reducing (H2-, CO2-containing) atmospheres. Therefore, the electrotransport state of each side of a proton-conducting electrolyte can be known. The exceptions are the conditions with unidentified pO2 values (for example, dry H2 with unspecified H2O).
• Not only electronic conductivity can be distinguished from ionic, but ionic conductivity can also be separated into oxygen-ionic and protonic components. The latter can be performed when the logσtotal–logpO2 dependences are recorded at several starting values of pH2O under isothermal mode and the same experiments are performed at several temperatures.
• These electrochemical measurements are usually carried out at relatively high temperatures (above 500 °C), when grain transport governs by the overall transport of PCMs. Therefore, in order to provide the low-temperature measurements of the logσtotal–logpO2 dependences, it is necessary to correctly distinguish between grain and grain boundary transport.

Fig. 2a displays only −1/4 and 1/4 slopes. This is the classical situation. Both n- and p-type electronic conductivities can achieve other slopes75 due to various electroneutrality conditions or the effects of grain boundaries (for low-temperature measurements).
3.2 Electromotive force measurements
Electromotive force measurements (EMF) are based on the principle of reading voltage potential differences (ΔU = E) for a hypothetical cell composed of an electrolyte with reversible electrodes and subjected to a gradient of chemical potentials: (24)where tj is the transference number of ionic charge carrier j, zj is the number of electrons participating in the electrochemical reaction, μj is the chemical potential of spaces j determined as: μj = μoj + RTlnpj(25)Here, pj is the partial pressure of the potential-determined gas component.
Combining these two equations, the Wagner equation can be obtained: (26)the integration of which results in a derivative of the Nernst equation:76 (27)Going from the hypothetical cell to real electrochemical systems, this equation can be transformed in different ways depending on the main charge carriers of an electrolyte membrane:
• For cells based on oxygen-conducting electrolytes, eqn (27) attains the following form: (28)where ti is the ionic (oxygen-ionic) transference number, i = O; Eo is the thermodynamic value of an ideal oxygen-concentration cell. Considering unipolar oxygen-conducting electrolytes (for example, YSZ for which tO = 1), eqn (28) transforms to eqn (22).
• For cells with proton-conducting electrolytes, a special case of eqn (27) is (29)where ti = tH; zi = 2; EH is the thermodynamic value of an ideal hydrogen-concentration cell.
• For electrolytes exhibiting a co-ionic type of conductivity, i.e., oxygen-ionic combined with protonic, the real EMF values of the tested cell can be found as follows: (30)
As can be seen, this equation includes two terms related with partial pressures of oxygen and hydrogen. Eqn (21) shows the determination of pO2 for H2O/H2 gas mixtures; the pH2 level in oxidizing atmospheres can be calculated for the same way. However, in order to perform this operation, water partial pressure (as a source of hydrogen) must be necessarily specified: (31)
Analyzing the work dealing with application of PCMs in electrochemical cells, we conclude that most of the leading groups do not control or indicate pH2O in air; nevertheless, this is a potential-determined parameter affecting the efficiency of cells.
Returning to eqn (30), it can be seen that controlling both oxygen and hydrogen partial differences is difficult from practical viewpoint. Taking eqn (19) and (30) into account, the following derivative can be obtained: (32)
For practical reasons, this relation is the most convenient due to the possibility of simply setting or calculating both oxygen and water vapor partial pressures. Another important point consists in the possibility of calculating transference numbers by setting a null gradient for one of the partial pressure differences. For example, when the tested cell is subject to different atmospheres with the same pH2O, the second term of eqn (32) becomes 0; as a result, the ionic transference numbers of the tested electrolyte are equal to the ratio of the achieved (measured) voltage potential differences (Emeas) and the theoretical: (33)when no pO2 difference is created for the same cell, but the pH2O values from the opposite side of the electrolyte are different (i.e., the so-called steam-concentration cell), the proton transference number can be found: (34)The other transference numbers can be then calculated (eqn (35) and (36)) using the relation between transference number of all charge carriers (eqn (37)). tO = ti − tH(35) te = 1 − ti(36) ∑tj = 1(37)
3.3 EMF corrected with electrode–polarization corrections
The above-mentioned procedures are correct for idealized cells when the virtual electrode overpotentials are small enough not to significantly affect the achieved UOC. For actual (even for thin film) cells, the electrode overpotentials, which are comparable with the Ohmic voltage drop, cannot be ignored for the correct calculation of transference numbers.77
For an electrolyte membrane, the transfer numbers can be estimated using the EMF method with an active load according to the Gorelov method.78 This EMF method was first applied in 1988 with the aim of calculating the transference numbers of ions and electrons for a zirconia-based electrolyte to take the electrode polarization effect into account. Its essence lies in the possibility of including a variable resistance (Ract) in the external circuit (Fig. 3a). By analyzing the equivalent circuit of such a cell, the following expression can be derived: (38)
 Fig. 3  Features of EMF technique with electrode–polarization correction: (a) equivalent circuit scheme of the Pt|YSZ|Pt cell [78] where ET – current source with EMF equal to the thermodynamic value (EO); Ri – ionic resistance of the sample; Re – electronic resistance of the sample; Rp – polarization resistance of the electrodes; Ract – resistance box; Emeas (Emeas = E) – measured value of the EMF; (b) equivalent circuit scheme of a concentration cell based on an electrolyte with oxygen-ionic, protonic, and hole conductivities: RH and RO – proton and oxygen resistances of the sample; Rp,H and Rp,O – resistances of the hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions;79 (c) equivalent circuit diagram adopted for an electrolyte operated in both SOFC and SOEC modes.44 
When plotting dependencies in the ET/Emeas − (1/Ract) coordinates, the values (Rion + Rp) can be graphically determined as a slope of these dependencies and (Rion + Rp)/Re along the cut-off segment on the ordinate axis. The ratio of these values gives the electronic resistance value of the sample (Re). Knowing the total resistance of the sample (Rtotal), it is possible to estimate the average transport numbers of ions: (39)Although the described method was first used for oxygen-ionic electrolytes, it can be extended to more complex objects, for example, to proton-conducting materials having oxygen and electron transport as well as proton transport properties.74 In this case, although the equivalent circuit scheme (Fig. 3b) and the expression used (eqn (40)) are greatly complicated, the possibility of using such a modified EMF method for analyzing the transport characteristics of multi-ionic conductors is not excluded. (40)When no additional elements (such as a resistance box) are added to the equivalent circuit scheme, the ionic transference number can be obtained using an alternative approach as described by Liu and Hu in 1996.80 These authors provided the EMF measurements combined with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data. According to their analysis, the ionic transference number of an electrolyte (using BaCe0.8Gd0.2O3−δ as an example) can be obtained from precisely determined Ohmic and polarization (or total) resistances of the corresponding cell: (41)where ROhm is the Ohmic (bulk + grain boundary) resistance of the electrolyte.
We should stress that eqn (38), (40) and (41) include the EO term; firstly, this means that no water partial pressure gradient should be created for a PCM-based cell. Otherwise, the EH2O term in eqn (32) is not equal to 0 which prevents the calculation of ionic transference numbers. Secondly, the proposed equations are valid for a free-current (so-called, open circuit voltage) condition, when Emeas = UOC, while both PCFCs and PCECs operate at high current densities. Therefore, in order to describe the electron transport of proton-conducting membranes under real operating conditions, it is necessary to develop other approaches.
Recently, Haile's group81 derived mathematical expressions allowing the protonic (eqn (42)) and total (eqn (43)) current densities to be revealed for electrochemical cells operated in electrolysis mode. (42) (43)Here, U is the current electrolysis voltage, UOC is the open circuit voltage, Re is the electronic resistance determined as: (44)where RDC is the total resistance of the cell determined under a condition of ω → 0.
Although, these expressions were used to assess faradaic efficiency (ηF = jH/jext), they can be also used to determine the electronic current density under electrolysis mode (je = jext − jH).
In developing the model proposed by Liu and Hu, Zhang et al.44 have extended it from OCV conditions to including both fuel cell and electrolysis modes. They obtained the following expressions that connect the electronic and ionic resistances of the electrolyte membrane with measured (voltage, impedance) parameters: (45) (46)
Despite the above-mentioned modifications, the task of correctly describing the transport properties of PCMs under real operation modes is in the process of continuous development. In particular, these models consider that protons are the sole ionic charge carriers due to the inclusion of EH as a theoretical Nernst potential. However, as will be shown later, PCMs are co-ionic electrolytes, in which the contributions of oxygen-ionic and protonic conductivities (or corresponding transference numbers) are comparable at 600–700 °C. In this regard, the theoretical Nernst potential of a hypothetical co-ionic electrolyte should be calculated according to eqn (30), taking negligible electronic transport into account: ti = tO + tH = 1(47) te = tn + tp ≈ 0(48)
Although the condition described by eqn (47) can indeed be realized under relatively low temperatures (below 600 °C), electronic transport remains significant (as shown below in Table 3).
4 Electronic transport of individual proton-conducting materials
Apart from noting the presence of n- and p-type conductivities in PCMs that determine their absolute levels (or contributions), researchers have tended to neglect electronic transport features in recent years. However, when initiating the active use of PCMs as electrolytes for electrochemical devices, electronic transport becomes a crucial factor. This is because (parasitic) electron conductivity leads to an undesirable decrease in energy conversion efficiency even when providing superior performance.82
In what follows, we will present information on features of electronic transport for the individual PCMs, i.e., ceramic materials. As a rule, electronic transport in the provided works was evaluated according to the two most common approaches: either electromotive force (EMF) measurements using an oxygen concentration cell as a reference system or conductivity measurements depending on pO2 variation (see corresponding details in the previous section).
4.1 Electronic conductivity under reducing atmospheres
The evidence of n-type electronic transport for the perovskite-type PCMs under strongly reduced atmospheres is extremely limited compared to p-type electronic transport, which occurs in oxidizing atmospheres. Usually, the n-type conductivity is formed due to a partial reduction of transition elements existing in a structure. For example, a high electronic conductivity for CeO2-based ceramic materials is accompanied with the reduction of cerium-ions from Ce4+ (CexCe) to Ce3+, as shown the following reaction:43,53 (49)
This reaction is a partial case of eqn (4) where the reduced ions represent the localized electrons .
Other examples are LaFeO3-, SrFeO3-, and BaFeO3-based complex oxides, which display meaningful n-type conductivity values coming from the reduction of Fe3+-ions:83–85 (50)
A similar process occurs for other Fe-based derivatives – for example, for SrFe12O1986 and LaSr3Fe3O10.87 In this case, the electronic conductivity is regulated by small polarons (localized electrons), which in turn depend on the degree of Fe-ion reduction .
In the case of PCMs, the n-type electronic conductivity is assumed to be present for Ce-based perovskites, since they contain a transition element (cerium) as opposed to Zr-, Hf- or Th-based counterparts, which are extremely stable with regard to reduction across a wide range of temperatures and oxygen partial pressures. However, direct conductivity measurements depending on pO2 show that comparable values of electronic and ionic components occur only for SrCeO3-based PCMs (Fig. 4a). This can be attributed to the partial Ce4+-ions reduction (eqn (49)) similar to fluorite-structured CeO2 oxides. Forming one of the most studied class of PCMs, BaCeO3 also contains of Ce-ions. Nevertheless, detectable electronic conductivity seems to occur at more reduced atmospheres. Analysis of the literature data shows no considerable increase of conductivity for cerates under reducing atmospheres, at least within a pO2 range of 10−20–10−15 atm at 900 °C (Fig. 4b).

It is interesting to note that MIEC behavior for SrCeO3 occurs under experimentally achieved conditions (for example, hydrogen with various humidification degrees, see dotted lines in Fig. 4a and b), while materials of the BaCeO3 family simultaneously exhibit predominant ionic (protonic or co-ionic) conductivity. This indicates that the higher lattice volume reached for BaCeO3 stabilizes the Ce-sublattice towards the reduction of cerium-ions. One of the possible reasons consists in the fact that the Ce-ion reduction occurs with the participation of neighbor oxygen atoms. For perovskites with low lattice volumes, reaction (49) is facilitated due to a low Ce–O distance. On the contrary, this reaction becomes to be delayed for perovskites with higher lattice volumes.
Loureiro et al.94 estimated the equilibrium constant of reaction (49) to derive an empirical equation for BaCe0.9Y0.1O3−δ: Kred/(atm1/2) = 2.54 × 1021 exp(−9.68 × 104 T−1), whose high enthalpy (∼805 kJ mol−1) is responsible for the low reducibility of the studied phase at low- and intermediate-temperature ranges. In terms of partial conductivities, while the n-type electronic conductivity is 8 orders of magnitude lower than ionic conductivity at 400 °C, it is only 3 orders of magnitude lower at 600 °C (Fig. 4c). This means that cerates in H2-containing (especially, dry) atmospheres might exhibit meaningful electron conductivity at higher temperatures. However, the contribution of electronic conductivity is assumed to be relatively small (0.02 for BaCe0.9Nd0.1O3−δ at 600–800 °C, ref. 95).
It is noted that the electronic conductivity exhibits the highest activation energy (∼2.5 eV) compared with those for oxygen-ionic (∼1.5 eV) and protonic (0.5 eV) conductivities, while small-polaron mobility exhibits the lowest activation energy level (∼0.2 eV, Fig. 4d).
Thus, while BaCeO3-based PCMs have long been proposed as mostly ionic electrolytes for low- and intermediate-temperature PCFC/PCEC applications,96–98 SrCeO3-based materials have been successfully tested as hydrogen-permeation MIEC-membranes.99–101
In principle, hydrogen dissolution might occur in a highly reducing media via the following mechanism: (51)
Although, the effect of this reaction on overall electron transport has been claimed to be negligible,94 we note that hydrogen production in BaCeO3-based PCECs, hydrogen-permeable converters or hydrogen pumps should occur according to eqn (51): (52)or 2H+ + 2e′ → H2(53)Where e′ means external (for electrolytes) or internal (for MIECs) electron sources for the half-reaction.
Perovskites that do not contain reducible elements (for example, BaZrO3) might also exhibit n-type electron conduction. In this case, the reduction of oxides is realized with the formation of either band electrons (eqn (54)) or low-ionized oxygen vacancies (eqn (55)); the latter (known as F+-centers) are a product of the double-ionized vacancies with electrons, .102 (54) (55)
Regardless of the quasi-chemical representation, both these reactions correspond to the above-mentioned hydrogen evolution reaction (eqn (52) and (53)).
Returning to Fig. 4b, it can be seen that many perovskite phases (including, BaCeO3-based ones) demonstrate pure ionic conductivity in humidified reducing atmospheres. Nevertheless, n-type electron conductivity can still achieve competitive values at increased temperatures and lower oxygen partial pressures. Table 2 reports existing data on electron transport of the perovskite PCMs together with the characteristic pO2 values when the electron conductivity starts to equalize with ionic conductivity. Further decreases in pO2 (or the degree of humidity) result in electron conductivity becoming a dominating factor in the overall transport of PCMs. These features should be considered when designing the protonic ceramic electrochemical devices, which operate in “dry” reducing atmospheres, including hydrogen production, alkane conversion103–105 (ethane to ethylene, methane to benzene), ammonia synthesis,106,107etc. For example, the recent work of Wrubel et al.108 theoretically confirmed that cerium reduction of the BaCe1−x−yZrxYyO3−δ or BaCe1−x−y−zZrxYyYbzO3−δ phases might significantly decrease the faradaic efficiency of the corresponding PCECs as compared with the BaZr1−xYxO3−δ phases composed of cations (zirconium, yttrium ions) with stable oxidation states.

4.2 Electronic conductivity under oxidizing atmospheres
As shown by eqn (6), p-type electronic conductivity, which appears under oxidizing atmospheres, is a common sign of almost all representatives of perovskite-type PCMs.
It makes sense to start this subsection on examples of doped BaCeO3 materials, which represent the system demonstrating the highest proton conductivity values. Generally, cerates can be fully attributed to triple-conducting materials (TCMs), since the comparability of each partial conductivity with the other is clear from the corresponding transference numbers of the main charge carriers, Table 3. These data are in good agreement with the generally understood considerations on electroneutral conditions (Table 1). As an example, Fig. 5a provides experimentally determined domains for CaHf0.9Sc0.1O3−δ, within which the corresponding partial conductivities predominate.

Copyright 2021, Elsevier. 
We should note that the differentiation of the total conductivity into the partial components generally occurs at relatively high temperatures (>500 °C). Under such conditions, the influence of grain boundaries is minimized, and the overall transport of PCMs is determined by the grains.
It is interesting to analyze temperature dependences of the total and partial conductivities of PCMs (see real experimental data in Fig. 4c and schematic representation in Fig. 5b). It can be seen that all partial conductivities increase with heating in area I. At the same time, their activation energies form a common tendency for the Ba-based PCMs: Ea,H < Ea,O < (or ≈) Ea,p. This means that the hole conductivity increases more strongly than the oxygen-ionic and protonic conductivities. In other words, while such materials are predominantly protonic conductors at low temperatures, they become p-type electronic conductors at very high temperatures, while intermediate temperatures correspond to a mixed type of conductivity, including triple-conducting transport.
The real experimental data for area II are in almost complete accordance; here, a distinct difference consists in the fact that the T-profile of protonic conductivity is not monotonous but exhibits a maximum at a certain temperature. This maximum is due to two simultaneous competitive effects (Fig. 5c): increasing proton mobility with heating and decreasing proton concentration due to the exothermic nature of reaction (2).
Some key findings can be formulated from an analysis of Fig. 5b:
• Discussing the temperature-profile of the total conductivity as a sum of the partial components, the term “apparent activation energy” should be used in place of “activation energy”. In detail, the apparent activation energy can attain different values depending on the level of each partial conductivity.
• For oxidizing atmospheres, while the total conductivity increases gradually with heating, the tendency for the apparent activation energy to increase is due to changes in the predominant partial conductivity (from protonic to oxygen-ionic and electronic).
• For reducing atmospheres, the T-profile of the total conductivity can vary with heating: depending on pH2O and water uptake capability of an oxide, the total conductivity might also increase or even decrease. While the latter is uncommon, it occurs for pronounced PCMs, when protonic conductivity prevails over oxygen-ionic across a wide temperature range; at the same time, the apparent activation energies of the total conductivity can attain close-to-null (or even negative) values (Fig. 5d).
The development of low-temperature electrochemical devices is a rational approach for preventing the negative effect of electronic transport on the electrochemical behavior of such devices.
4.3 P-Type electronic conductivity for various perovskite representatives of proton-conducting materials
Since partial conductivities evidently depend on the chemical composition of PCMs, it is necessary to assess the variation of these properties under different modifications of an ABO3 perovskite structure.

4.3.1 Influence of B-site modification of ABO3. 
Considering a B-modification of ABO3, we selected BaCeO3-based materials as a reference system. Layageva et al.92 have studied p-type electronic transport of gas-tight BaCe0.8−xZrxY0.2O3−δ (BCZY) materials. Such a concentration range is of significant interest due to its extreme members belonging not only to BaCeO3-based phases, but also to BaZrO3-based phases, comprising one of the most studied PCM types. Measuring the total conductivity of BCZY depending on pO2 at different temperatures, the authors found that increasing the zirconium concentration leads to a gradual decrease in both ionic and electronic conductivity, as well as to a considerable increase in the contribution of p-type conductivity (Fig. 6a). The changes in the transport properties are so significant that the Zr-enriched phases (including pure zirconate, x = 0.8) are predominantly electronic conducting even at 750 °C. The recent work of Han et al.117 confirmed the previous results, which show that hole transport in the same materials (BCZY) starts to rapidly dominate with increasing x.
 Fig. 6  Electronic conductivity features of PCMs: (a) concentration dependences of hole transference number of BaCe0.8−xZrxY0.2O3−δ according to ref. 92 (1) and ref. 122 (2); (b) oxygen partial pressure dependences of total conductivity for BaCe0.85Sm0.15O3−δ (1), BaCe0.85Pr0.15O3−δ (2), and undoped BaCeO3 (3), ref. 90; (c) concentration dependences of the hole transference number of BaZr1−xYxO3−δ according to ref. 123 (1) and ref. 124 (2). 
Some possible explanations of the observed behavior are as follows:
• Grain boundary features. When Zr-concentration (x) in the BaCe1−x−yZrxRyO3−δ increases, the grain size of the ceramic materials falls considerably due to the refractory nature of zirconium compared to cerium. It is well known that, although ionic (particularly, protonic) transport (Fig. S1, ESI†) is limited by grain boundaries, these do not have detrimental effects on electronic transport. Therefore, decreasing the grain size results in an increase in both grain boundary density and corresponding resistance to ionic transportation.
• Grain features. If grain boundaries depend on the microstructural parameters of the prepared ceramic materials, grain transport is regulated by chemical and crystallostructural factors. The volume and other parameters of a perovskite cell diminish with the decreasing ionic radius of B-cations. Although this inhibits the mobility of oxygen-ion charge carriers due to their greater mass, no such limitations occur for protons and electronic holes. Since the hydration ability of BaCeO3- and BaZrO3-based phases can be assumed to be similar (Fig. S2, ESI†), the bulk proton conductivities also attain comparable values. Therefore, the level (and contribution) of ionic conductivity decreases for more packed perovskite structures, while the relative contribution of p-type electronic conductivity increases.
The same tendency should occur for other types of Ce-substitution in BaCeO3, for example, with tin, hafnium, thorium.


4.3.2 Influence of A-site modification of ABO3. 
The isovalent substitution of barium in doped BaCeO3 and transport properties of derivatives obtained therefrom were first studied by Zhang and Zhao.125 The authors used the EMF technique to determine tendencies in protonic and oxygen conductivity variations for a Ba1−xSrxCe0.9Nd0.lO3−δ system (x = 0, 0.1 and 0.2). Decreasing the average ionic radius of A-cations resulted in improved proton transport, since the proton transference numbers arose gradually with variation in x from 0 to 0.2. These ionic transportation results are in line with those obtained when changing B-site ABO3 cations. The relationships between A-site cations in ABO3 and their proton transportation were well discussed recently:29 when the size of A-cations decreases, the lattice volume of a perovskite structure decreases accordingly, inhibiting oxygen transport through the migration channels (as-called “free volume”). For co-ionic systems, which exhibit both oxygen-ionic and protonic conductivity, proton transportation becomes more pronounced, when oxygen transport is deteriorated due to mentioned dimension factors. However, an unexpected result involved a decrease in the hole transference numbers.
Kato et al.126 have studied the transport properties of zirconates formed with various alkaline-earth elements (AZr0.9Y0.1O3−δ, A = Ca, Sr, Ba or Ba/Sr). They found that BaZr0.9Y0.1O3−δ is a predominant electronic conductor at 700 °C; here, the hole transference number is equal to 0.72. The hole transference numbers of 0.33 and 0.15 exhibited by SrZr0.9Y0.1O3−δ and CaZr0.9Y0.1O3−δ counterparts, respectively, are much lower than those obtained for the zirconate ceramic. Therefore, this work confirms the results obtained for Ba1−xSrxCe0.9Nd0.lO3−δ, presenting a notable difference in electronic transport variations upon A- and B-site modifications of ABO3. It is evidently that sole dimension parameters cannot explain these findings; probably, there exist other factors leading to better electrolytic properties when the A-site ionic radius decreases.

Table 4 summarizes transport properties of CaZrO3-, SrZrO3- and BaZrO3-based materials and confirms that the former exhibit the wider electrolytic domain boundaries.

4.3.3 Influence of acceptor doping concentration of ABO3. 
Nominally undoped PCMs display insufficient ionic conductivity due to low defect disordering. For example, the total conductivity of BaCeO3, which is below 1 mS cm−1 at 900 °C, is composed of both p- and n-type electronic transport (Fig. 6b).
If a basic oxide is doped with an acceptor dopant having a constant oxidation state, the ionic component of increased total conductivity dominates. This is due to the formation of oxygen vacancies (eqn (1)) responsible for the oxygen-ionic and protonic transport. A gradual increase of the doping amount (within a certain concentration range) results in a growth of both the absolute level and relative contribution of ionic conductivity; as a result, the hole transference numbers decrease (Fig. 6c), indicating that heavy doped oxides exhibit better electrolytic domain boundaries. Evidently, the mentioned tendency occurs when all materials of a concentration system are single-phase and defect interactions (some examples of double and triple complexes are presented by eqn (56)–(58), ref. 137) have a minor impact on transport properties of AB1−xMxO3−δ PCMs. (56) (57) (58)

4.4 Approaches for minimizing electronic transport
As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 5a, a region of electronic conductivity occurs under certain experimental conditions. In order to govern the electron transport of PCMs to reduce its negative influence on the performance of protonic ceramic electrochemical cells, temperature, oxygen partial pressure and water partial pressure are the main factors, which can be easily altered.

4.4.1 Temperature. 
We recently noted that the activation energy of electronic conductivity of PCMs attains very high values of around 1.5 eV and even higher, exceeding those for oxygen-ionic and protonic conductivities (Fig. 5b). This means that a temperature increase results in a more significant increase in the level (and contribution) of electronic conductivity, transforming low-temperature electrolytic-type PCMs into mixed ionic-electronic conductors at elevated temperatures. Consequently, temperature is the main parameter for determining the electrolytic domain boundaries. In order to reduce the effects of undesirable electron transport of PCMs on the output properties of protonic ceramic electrochemical cells, the latter should be operated at low- and intermediate-temperature ranges. This strategy is constantly developing due to the design of new electrolyte materials,121,138–141 novel thin-film technologies,32,142,143 and innovative highly active electrode systems.144–148


4.4.2 Oxygen partial pressure. 
According to eqn (8) or (10), the concentration of electron holes is proportional to pO2 in a power of 1/4 as derived from the consideration of defect formation and interaction. Therefore, creating more reducing atmospheres also affects a decrease in the p-type electronic conductivity.
In order to demonstrate the regulation of total PCM conductivity by the electronic component under oxidizing conditions and elevated temperatures, the original data obtained for the logσtotal–logpO2 coordinates are typically replotted in the σtotal – (pO2)1/4 coordinates, Fig. 7a. The obtained dependences exhibit a linear form that satisfies the following empirical equation: σtotal = σion + σp,o·(pO2)1/4(59)
 Fig. 7  Effects of pO2 variation on p-type electronic transport in proton-conducting ceramic materials: (a) functional dependences of total conductivity for Ba0.95Ce0.8Y0.2O3−δ as a function of pO2 at different temperatures (pH2O = 0.022 atm); reprinted with permission from ref. 149.

Copyright 2018, Elsevier. 
A more common approach consists in plotting the preliminarily determined electronic conductivity along with total conductivity in the unmodified logσtotal–logpO2 coordinates, Fig. 7b. In this case, we can not only confirm the linearity of p-type electronic conductivity (eqn (60)), but also determine a power function of this relation. σp = σp,o·(pO2)1/4(60)
This approach is especially more advantageous than the previous one if the power function in eqn (60) is not constant but changes in different pO2 ranges due to various electroneutrality conditions (see an example in Fig. 7c).
Although measuring the corresponding dependences on pO2 requires additional specific equipment for precise setting and regulation of pO2 at elevated temperatures, the level and contribution of electronic conductivity of PCMs can be measured in atmospheres having different pO2 values (but constant pH2O) – for example, wet air/wet N2 (wet Ar)/wet H2. Since n-type electronic conductivity is negligible for wet reducing atmospheres (pO2 = 10−25–10−20 atm), it can be assumed that any transport occurring there is ionic. Conversely, most PCMs display mixed ionic-electronic conducting behavior under oxidizing conditions. Therefore, the level of p-type electronic conductivity can be assessed when comparing these data for a particular composition, while, for different compositions, the electrolytic domain boundaries can be estimated by comparing these data. Fig. 7d presents experimental results obtained for the highly dense BaCe0.8−xZrxDy0.2O3−δ ceramic materials. According to the analysis performed at 600 °C, a gradual Zr-doping (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6) results in a decrease in ionic conductivity (31.3, 11.5, 6.9 mS cm−1), an increase in hole conductivity (2.1, 2.7, 3.2 mS cm−1) and an increase in hole transference numbers (0.07, 0.19, 0.32), respectively. The provided example again confirms that Zr-enriched phases exhibit narrower electrolytic properties than the Ce-enriched derivatives.


4.4.3 Water partial pressure. 
It is to be expected that temperature and oxygen partial pressure parameters will affect the chemistry of electronic defects and, correspondingly, the electronic conduction behavior of simple and complex oxide systems.53,75 However, a distinct feature of PCMs consists in their ability to transfer the protons. The latter participate in defect interaction, site-mass balance, and electroneutrality conditions, acting as an additional parameter affecting the concentration of other defects. As can be seen from eqn (8)–(11), the concentrations of both electrons and holes depend on protons concentration, which, in turn, is mainly regulated by water vapor partial pressure.152
The research group led by Animitsa153,154 was one of the first to study the transport properties of PCMs depending on pO2 variation by setting two starting (dry and wet) atmospheres (Fig. 8a). This procedure was carried out in order to determine the level of ionic conductivity (at low and intermediate pO2 values) due to the studied phases demonstrating a mixed type of conductivity at oxidizing atmospheres. Therefore, correctly separating the total conductivity into partial components is challenging and requires additional approaches. Despite their attention to the ionic region of the logσtotal–logpO2 dependences, electron conductivity at high pO2 values was also altered, implying that pH2O affects p-type electron conductivity.

Copyright 2021, ACS Publishing. 
Direct evidence of decreasing hole conductivity for BaCe0.9Y0.1O3−δ upon humidification of an atmosphere (with constant pO2) has been provided by Oishi et al.91 (see Fig. 8b), which indeed should occur as shown in the analysis of PCM defect chemistry (Fig. 8c).
Analyzing the transport properties of BaZr0.85Y0.15O3−δ, Ji et al.155 obtained conductivity measurements across wide ranges of pO2 (10−25–1 atm) and pH2O (10−4.5–10−1.6 atm) at 800 °C. These experiments demonstrated that water vapor activity (or partial pressure) has no significant influence on the total conductivity under oxidizing atmospheres (pure O2, air), see Fig. 8d. At the same time, a visible change occurred when oxygen partial pressure was reduced down to 0.02 atm and below. These data can be explained as follows:
• At oxidizing conditions, hole conductivity achieves high values due to the high concentration of electron holes (Section 5.4.1). Humidification of a surrounding atmosphere leads to an increase in proton concentration and a decrease in hole concentration (Fig. 8c). Therefore, the virtually unchanged total conductivity with humidification is a result of two competing processes: an increase in proton conductivity and an equivalent decrease in p-type electronic conductivity.
• Under more reducing conditions, hole conductivity decreases considerably (Section 5.4.2). Humidification of these atmospheres results in an increase in total conductivity due to the increasing domination of improved proton transport over deteriorating hole transport.
These considerations can be clearly seen in the graphic form of experimental results as presented in Fig. 8e.
When discussing the region of relatively low temperatures, humidification has little effect on the variation in total conductivity in most cases, even under more reducing conditions. This again correlates with the competitive behavior of partial conductivities. Along with a slight variation in total conductivities, the contributions of partial conductivities change considerably (see extending diagrams in Fig. S3, ESI†). In detail, an increase of pH2O from 0.003 to 0.32 atm (pO2 = 10−5 atm, T = 600 °C) leads to an improvement in the proton transport of BaZr0.8Y0.2O3−δ: proton transference numbers rise from 0.75 to 0.95.158
Han et al.157 studied the transport properties of the BaZr0.8Y0.2O3−δ ceramic material across a wide range of pO2 (10−25–1 atm) with pH2O varying from 0.03 to 0.51 atm. They found that humidification resulted in a gradual increase in the ionic conductivity to almost double at 700 °C (Fig. 8f). This increase is attributed to hydration of the BaZr0.8Y0.2O3−δ phase, whose limit is not reached even at pH2O = 0.51 atm. At lower temperatures (500 °C), the total conductivity increased only within a pH2O range of 0.03–0.10 atm, while further humidification had no visible effect on conductivity due to reaching the hydration limit. Other interesting results were obtained following analysis of the experimental data: it was found that the hole transference numbers were considerably decreased with increasing pH2O, from ∼0.7 at pH2O = 0.03 atm down to ∼0.20 at pH2O = 0.51 atm. In other words, pH2O is a parameter exhibiting a similar influence on electron transportation of PCMs as temperature and oxygen partial pressure.

5 Theoretical and modelling approaches towards revealing links between the electron conductivity of proton-conducting electrolytes and the performance and efficiency of protonic ceramic electrochemical cells
Modelling and simulation are powerful means for revealing clear relationships between the output characteristics of protonic ceramic electrochemical cells constituted by functional materials that include PCMs. Historically, the publication of the first theoretical studies of PCM-based electrochemical cells began at the turn of the present century. Since that time, these works have been devoted to two main aspects (Table 5):

• Comparison of determinative characteristics of SOFCs or SOECs depending on the transport nature of electrolyte membranes: oxygen-ionic (ti ≈ to), protonic (ti ≈ tH) or co-ionic (ti = to + tH);
• Optimization of PCFC or PCEC operation by separating their overall performances into electrolyte (Ohmic voltage drop) as well as electrode (activation and concentration overpotentials) components.
Further studies have been devoted not only to improving PCFC performance, but also to searching for an optimized combination of performance and efficiency. Therefore, electron transport of PCMs has become an important parameter in the modeling process.
For example, Nakamura et al.178 have performed simulations to discover the effects of protonic and electronic conduction of a model PCM-membrane on performance (power density, P) and efficiency (η) of a PCFC (Fig. 9a). Both these parameters improved with increasing proton conductivity of a BZY20 membrane respective to a reference value (when the electronic conductivity was kept unchanged). This can be explained by a lower Ohmic loss realized for highly conductive electrolytes. A somewhat different situation occurred with an increase in hole conductivity (when the protonic conductivity achieved a constant value): since depending mainly on ionic transport, the power density behavior was unchanged; at the same time, energy efficiency deteriorated noticeably, especially at the lower current densities corresponding to the cell's higher voltage. This analysis allows a quality assessment to be carried out for optimizing the P and η parameters of PCFCs by tailoring PCM compositions – and, correspondingly, their ionic and electronic conductivities.

Copyright 2018, IOP Publishing. 
Considering the natural properties of electrolyte materials and temperature as the main factor affecting efficiency, Putilov et al.179 have constructed one of the most complete theoretical models by linking the P and η parameters of PCFCs with the transport properties of PCMs, as well as external parameters (temperature and water vapor partial pressures) that can be experimentally set/regulated. These results indicate the more complex character of ongoing processes (Fig. 9b). In detail, the proposed model accounts for simultaneous changes of protonic and electronic conductivities depending on the variation of pH2O from both sides of a model membrane. Although hydrogen humidification was shown to lead to an increase in proton conductivity, hole conductivity also increased, resulting in no efficiency gain (in terms of proton transference numbers, see also additional Fig. S4 for clarity, ESI†). On the other hand, air humidification led to higher protonic conductivity and lower hole conductivity with a resulting increase in the proton transference number under open circuit voltage (UOC). However, changes to the proton transference number (and consequent faradaic efficiency) under operation mode (U = 0.7 V) were negligible due to the predomination of proton transport at any given conditions, at least at 600 °C. Combining these findings, it is clear that hole defects can contribute considerably to charge transfer at high fuel humidification and/or temperature values, especially at high PCFC voltages (at U > 0.7 V) and at U > UOC realized for PCECs.
Zhang et al.180 have considered the impacts of conductivity distribution and electrolyte leakage current in their simulation carried out under a wide variation of output voltages of a PCFC (from UOC to 0 V). Generally, the correlations they obtained with a special focus on fuel humidification were the same as others recently revealed (Fig. 9c). According to their simulation results, an increase of pH2O at the anode side results in two competitive effects. From one side, effective proton conductivity increases leading to a higher PCFC performance, while from the other, oxygen activity distribution across the electrolyte also increases leading to a higher electron leakage current and concomitantly lower PCFC efficiency. Therefore, there is a certain compromise involved in selecting the appropriate pH2O values at the anode side.
Zhu et al.181 utilized a Nernst-Planck model to characterize the performance and efficiency of a reversible protonic ceramic cell (rPCC) based on BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3−δ (BCZYYb), one of the most studied PCMs. For this electrolyte, the predicted faradaic efficiency was close to 1 at 500 °C for both electrolysis and fuel cell modes (Fig. 9d); however, at higher temperatures, it declined, with the extent of this decline being higher in electrolysis mode. The deterioration of the predicted faradaic efficiency with heating correlates with the corresponding increase in p-type electronic conductivity of BCZYYb, while the lower predicted faradaic efficiency in electrolysis cell mode than that demonstrated in fuel cell mode can be explained by the greater electronic flux with increasing applied potential of the rPCC.
6 Effects of electronic current on the performance and efficiency of protonic ceramic electrochemical cells
The first parameter under testing of protonic ceramic electrochemical cells, open circuit voltage (UOC) provides important data on electronic conductivity of PCMs. Considering eqn (29), it is clear that the proton transference number of an electrolyte membrane can be obtained as follows: (61)
The generated UOC (UOC = Emeas) values of such cells generally achieve 1.0–1.1 V at 400–600 °C. On this basis, researchers may conclude that there is no gas-leakage in the tested system and no electronic conductivity in the electrolyte. However, to provide a quantified confirmation of this, the thermodynamic (Nernstian) potential should be additionally determined. This is possible when hydrogen partial pressures are known for both reducing and oxidizing atmospheres. If pH2 is proportional to the volume concentration of H2 for a reducing atmosphere, it is regulated by hydrogen-containing gas components (mostly, H2O) in an oxidizing atmosphere, see eqn 31. Therefore, for any characterization of individual PCMs as well as PCM-based electrochemical cells, the water partial pressure needs to be set for a given oxidant.

Fig. 10a illustrates the theoretical potential values that should be achieved in the case of a PCFC based on an ideal protonic (tH = 1) and dense conductor. As can be seen from these data, pH2O at the cathode side significantly affects this potential. For PCFCs, EH reaches 1.176 V if static (ambient) air is used; however, this decreases down to 1.135 V (−41 mV) if pH2O is set to around 0.03 atm (air bubbling through water at 25 °C). In order to provide steam electrolysis in PCECs, pH2O in air should achieve high values; in that case, EH is below 1 V at pH2O = 0.5 atm when T > 650 °C.

These data were extracted from Tables 16 and 17 of ref. 182 and Table 6 of ref. 31. 
Owing to either non-protonic transport and/or poor gas-tightness of the electrolyte membrane, Emeas values are lower than EH. If the latter is a sign of technological factors having the potential to be improved, non-protonic transport is dependent on the natural properties of electrolyte compounds. Generally, PCMs are triple-conducting materials; this feature is a considerable issue in terms of assessing transport properties. For example, if the real potential of a SOFC (UOC) is lower than the Nernstian potential by ∼40 mV for an ideal protonic conductor (Fig. 10b), this might be associated with various reasons: a certain electronic transport taking place with proton transport (tH + te = 1), the realization of pure oxygen-ionic transport (tO = 1) or infinity variants for other cases, tH + te + tO = 1.

Fig. 10c provides UOC achieved for PCFCs based on BaCeO3, BaZrO3 and Ba(Ce,Zr)O3 electrolytes at 600 °C. Although EH can be varied depending on real pH2O in air, this parameter attains ∼1.15 V (or more) at the selected temperature. Considering these data, it is clear that cerates (without zirconium) can reach the theoretical potentials, thus implying that they might satisfy the tH = 1 condition. However, when Ce-with-Zr substitution is performed, UOC decreases down to 0.85–0.95 V for zirconates (without cerium). Such a comparative analysis allows the conclusion to be formulated that zirconates exhibit a higher contribution of electronic conductivity than that of cerates under the same conditions. This conclusion agrees well with the data presented in Fig. 6a.
Danilov et al.183 utilized Gorelov's approach to studying electronic transport of a 20 μm-thick BaCe0.5Zr0.3Dy0.2O3−δ (BCZD) proton-conducting electrolyte in fuel cell mode. The researchers assessed the electronic resistance of BCZD by adding an external resistance into the equivalent circuit scheme. The interesting results obtained can be explained in terms of the PCFC being characterized in a wide temperature range of 600–800 °C, which is typically wider than the conventional temperature range (as a rule, below 750 °C). It was found (Fig. 11b) that the power density of such a PCFC first increased due to a decrease in both Ohmic and polarization resistances, but then dropped considerably owing to improved electron transport. In the same work, a possible strategy was considered for diminishing undesirable electron transport of BCZD. This was based on the additional humidification of cathode and anode sides (pH2O varied from 0.03 to 0.10 atm), resulting in a higher open circuit voltage (by ∼6%), greater ionic conductivity (by ∼17%), and an increased ionic transference number (by ∼6%) at 700 °C. Therefore, the conception of decreasing hole conductivity upon gas humidification (eqn (62)) has been confirmed not only for symmetrical cells (when both electrolyte sides are in the same atmosphere), but also for PCFCs (when the opposite electrolyte sides are under various atmospheres). (62)

Huan et al.185 investigated the real polarization of electrodes for a PCEC based on a proton-conducting electrolyte (BaCe0.5Zr0.3Y0.2O3−δ) with a small amount of electron transport. The authors derived an equation that allows the real polarization resistance (Rp,r) to be evaluated as opposite to the apparent polarization resistance (Rp) determined directly from the impedance spectra: (63)
As can be seen from Fig. 11c, the Rp/Rp,r ratio deviates from 1 with a decrease in ionic transference number, showing that electronic transport of the electrolytes affects the electrodes’ performance. These data provide an important conclusion: electrochemical activity of various electrodes should be compared for one sort of the proton-conducting electrolyte and under the same conditions (T, pO2, pH2O).
The lower Rp values (compared to Rp,r) can be explained in terms of the mixed ionic-electronic conductivity of an electrolyte that might increase a number of active sites for electrode reactions at the subsurface of the electrolyte membrane. Therefore, such a mixed conductivity is an additional factor for improving the electrochemical activity of the electrodes.
Shimada et al.184 revealed a relationship between the UOC of PCFCs as a sign of electronic leakage and the Rp/ROhm ratio, Fig. 11a. According to their analysis, the utilization of electrochemically active electrodes allows very high UOC values (∼98% from the theoretical ones at 550–600 °C) to be achieved when a BaCe0.7Zr0.1Y0.1Yb0.1O3−δ (BCZYYb) electrolyte is utilized. However, for other types of PCMs having a higher contribution of electronic conductivity (for example, zirconates), no similar correlations were revealed.
Duan et al.186 provided a comprehensive comparative analysis between PCECs based on various PCMs: BCZYYb and BaZr0.8Y0.2O3−δ (BZY20). They confirmed (Fig. 11d) that the latter electrolyte exhibits a narrower electrolytic domain boundary, since lowering both faradaic and energy conversion efficiency. On the contrary, the BCZYYb-based PCEC was able to demonstrate faradaic efficiency of around 85% at 600 °C and 10%H2O in air. However, this parameter can be purposefully increased up to 95% in case of higher air humidification. The results of this research confirm two previously revealed conclusions: (1) Zr-enriched PCMs comprise more pronounced MIECs than Ce-enriched compounds; (2) air humidification suppresses p-type electronic conductivity of PCMs along with the electron leakage effects of the associated electrochemical cells.
In terms of achieving high PCEC energy efficiency, the work of Choi et al.81 should be also mentioned. The 15 μm-thick BaZr0.4Ce0.4Y0.1Yb0.1O3−δ-based PCEC fabricated by these researchers yielded a current density of 1.8 A cm−2 and faradaic efficiency of 76% at 600 °C. Moreover, they proposed a model enabling the faradaic efficiency to be calculated directly from the measured parameters as a ratio of protonic current (IH) and total current (Itotal), see eqn (42)–(44).
The latter two works report the results of fabrication and characterization of protonic ceramic electrochemical cells along with one of the highest performances and efficiencies among reported to date.
7 Concluding remarks and further prospects
The overview presented in the current work shows that the inherent electronic conductivity of state-of-the-art proton-conducting materials allows these phases to be attributed to either mixed or triple conductors. From the viewpoint of the electrolytic domain boundary, any electronic contribution in electrolytes negatively affects the efficiency (or even performance) of the associated electrochemical (fuel, electrolysis, converter) cells. This negative effect is caused by the formation of parasitic electronic leakage, which does not contribute to the desired electrochemical processes.
The data brought together in this article demonstrate how electronic transport in proton-conducting electrolytes can be eliminated. In detail, two main general strategies are deployed in materials science and operation fields. The first of these is based on a rational selection of appropriate electrolyte materials exhibiting more pronounced electrolytic properties than others at similar comparing conditions. The second strategy involves purposeful changes applied to external parameters (decreasing temperature, increasing water vapor partial pressure, decreasing oxygen partial pressure) leading to reduced electron transportation of the particular electrolytes. Ideally, a combination of two mentioned strategies can achieve excellent improvements in efficiency even for Zr-based proton-conducting electrolytes.
Another widely proposed approach for decreasing electron leakage in electrolytes presented in the literature consists in the formation of the so-called blocking layers. However, since this strategy has been thoroughly discussed in a number of research works187–200 and reviews42,43,201 it is considered to be beyond the scope of the present overview.
To conclude, electronic conductivity is an important property of proton-conducting ceramic materials, which must be taken into account when scaling and manufacturing protonic ceramic fuel and electrolysis cells.

Broader context
Protonic ceramic cells belong to a hot research topic in the electrochemical energy field, since they can provide a wide range of functionalities for current demands of industry, including electricity generation in protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs), hydrogen production in protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs), varies conversion processes in protonic ceramic electrochemical reformers (PCERs). Despite of many paramount results reached, PCFCs, PCECs, and PCERs suffer from electronic conductivity, which is a natural sign of the-state-of-the-art proton-conducting ceramic electrolytes. There is a few strategies to diminish undesirable electronic conductivity; these strategies lie on tailoring chemical compositions of the electrolytes or varying external (technological) factors. The current work overviews the mentioned strategies in detail, acting a starting point for designing modernized electrochemical systems for energy conversion and electrochemical purposes. This work is assumed to be a great importance for chemists, researchers in energy and electrochemistry fields, high school professors and students, since it first gives summarized results on electron transport in proton-conducting materials and related electrochemical cells.
