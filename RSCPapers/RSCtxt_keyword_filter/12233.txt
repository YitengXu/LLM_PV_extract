    , Accepted 27th August 2019First published on 28th August 2019AbstractThe all-inorganic perovskite CsPbI3 has emerged as an alternative photovoltaic material to organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites due to its non-volatile composition and comparable photovoltaic performance. However, its spontaneous deformation from the light-active black phase to a light-inactive yellow phase under ambient conditions, poor air stability, low thermal stability as well as high-temperature processing are challenging issues in the fabrication of CsPbI3-based solar cells. Herein, we introduce a new surface passivation strategy using camphor sulfonic acid (CSA) to improve the surface morphology and air stability of Ba-stabilized α-CsPbI3 perovskites at low temperature. The surface passivated, Ba-doped α-CsPbI3 was thermally stable upon annealing and highly photo-stable over a year, and it also exhibited a band gap of ∼1.72 eV, which is suitable for optoelectronic applications. The all-inorganic solar cell based on the Ba-doped α-CsPbI3 retained 98% of its initial PCE value even after 700 h, and red light-emitting diodes (LED) exhibited light emission at 700 nm with a bandwidth of 39 nm. To date, this is the first study on surface passivated, Ba-stabilized α-CsPbI3, which provides opportunities for the development of highly efficient tandem solar cells and other optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
In pursuit of low-cost and easily fabricated solar cells, perovskite has emerged as a strong candidate for future energy materials. Organic–inorganic hybrid halide perovskite solar cells have recorded an efficiency of over 20%1–3via the optimization of a thin-film growth, interface, and absorber materials. However, the volatile nature of organic cations (i.e., methylammonium (MA+) and formamidinium (FA+)) in the ABX3 crystal-structured perovskite (A = cation, B = metal anion, and X = halide) hinders its stability under environmental stress, such as moisture, heat, oxygen, and ultraviolet (UV) light. Moreover, several routes have been explored to resolve the stability issue. Cations such as cesium (Cs+) and rubidium (Rb+) have been mixed with the existing cations (MA+ and FA+) to obtain good properties, but still the thermal stability is a serious issue. The non-volatile and hysteresis-free characteristics of inorganic perovskite materials have attracted increasing attention in recent years after several reports on the low-temperature α-phase stabilization of CsPbI3.4–9 One-step solution processing offers easy fabrication, while high photo-stability benefits long-term stability. Cesium lead iodide perovskite solar cells have emerged as a new alternative for stable perovskite solar cells and have achieved an efficiency from 2.9% up to 17.06% within a short time.6,10–13 Unfortunately, it suffers from the metastable phase at room temperature. Its thin films when heated above 330 °C exhibit an α-phase black perovskite, while upon cooling to room temperature it changes back to its original orthorhombic δ-phase.13,14 The incorporation of cesium cation leads to a phase transition because it is too small to fit inside the [PbI6]4− octahedra in the cubic perovskite structure.10,14,15 Snaith et al. reported the black phase stabilization of cesium lead iodide perovskite at room temperature using hydroiodic acid (HI), resulting in a PCE of 2.9%.13 The microstrain induced in the crystal lattice by HI was believed to be the major reason for the α-phase stabilization at room temperature. Subsequently, there were several reports on stabilizing the α-phase by employing excess HI with additional additives, but it still lacked thermal and air stability.16–18 On the other hand, partial substitution of the I− site with the smaller Br− stabilized the black phase and improved the thermal stability of the inorganic perovskite with a remarkable PCE of 13.74%, but it resulted in an increased band gap of up to 1.92 eV.8,19–21 Recently, the construction of the black phase of perovskite was extended to the partial doping of different metal ions into the B site metal such as bismuth, tin, europium, strontium, and calcium with an average PCE of around 13% or less.22–25 However, in most of these reports, air stability, surface morphology, and doping concentration optimization are serious issues. The α-CsPbI3 perovskite exhibits a suitable band gap of 1.73 eV for solar cells application.4,26 Thus, stabilizing the α-phase of the CsPbI3 perovskite at room temperature will open a new window for high efficiency and easy processing of perovskite solar cells. Zhao et al. reported an inspiring record efficiency of 17.06% with low-temperature processed α-CsPbI3 perovskite.4 However, although the PCE of these solar cells is approaching the values of their organic–inorganic perovskite counterparts, air instability, high-temperature processing and thermal instability are still challenging issues with the α-phase of CsPbI3.
Furthermore, the solubility of CsPbI3 is poor even in polar solvents such as DMSO and DMF.27 Thus, introducing a small amount of HI or incorporating a small amount of sulfonic acids increases its solubility and also stabilizes its black phase at room temperature.13,16 The crystal grain size of α-CsPbI3 thin films is as low as ∼100 nm and they are not thermally stable since they turn from the back to yellow phase after annealing at ∼100 °C. Also, these films suffer from large pin holes, which limit the charge transport mechanism.28 Partial substitution of iodide with bromide to form CsPbI2Br, CsPbIBr2 or CsPbBr3 can solve this issue, but it increases the band gap towards ∼1.92 eV,8,29 which is not favorable for solar cell application. Thus, stabilizing the α-phase of the CsPbI3 perovskite at low temperature and obtaining thermally stable black phase films will open new opportunities for red LEDs, solar cells, photo-detectors, and other optoelectronic devices.
To solve the phase, thermal, and air stability issues associated with α-CsPbI3, we studied the incorporation of surface passivation and B-site doping simultaneously. Herein, for the first time, we integrated CSA additive and Ba-doping for surface passivation and α-phase stabilization of the CsPbI3 perovskite. We observed that the incorporation of CSA improved the air stability and surface morphology, while the partial replacement of Ba2+ with Pb2+ stabilized the α-phase of CsPbI3 at low temperature. Also, Ba-doping led to higher thermal stability for the perovskite (i.e., Ba has a higher melting point of 727 °C than Pb of 327 °C). In this study, our density functional theory (DFT) calculations30,31 predicted the optimal Ba-doping amount from the variation in formation energy at different doping levels. Finally, we applied the α-CsPbI3 perovskite in solar cells and light-emitting diodes devices. We fabricated one-step solution processed inorganic PSCs and red LEDs at low temperature. The Ba-doped perovskite thin films showed higher phase stability upon annealing than the HI- or CSA-stabilized α-CsPbI3 thin films and maintained the black phase even after annealing up to 300 °C, as shown in Fig. 1a–c. Typical planar PSCs were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5diyl) (P3HT)/Au having different concentrations of CSA in the CsPb0.90Ba0.10I3 precursor solution. 2, 5, and 10 wt% of CSA in the CsPb0.90Ba0.10I3 perovskite solutions were denoted as CSA-1, CSA-2, and CSA-3, respectively. The CSA-2 PSCs exhibited a PCE of 7.23%. Red LEDs fabricated with the CSA-2 perovskite in ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/perovskite/2,2′,2′′-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) (TPBi)/LiF/Al exhibited a characteristic deep red emission at 700 nm with a maximum brightness of 2.17 cd m−2, external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.04%, and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 39 nm. This is the first low-temperature-processed inorganic PSCs and red LEDs with Ba-stabilized α-CsPbI3 perovskite having excellent thermal stability. By optimizing the charge transport interlayers, the efficiency of the red LEDs and solar cells can be improved further.

Experimental section
Materials
Barium iodide (BaI2, 99.9%), (1S)-(+)-10-camphor sulfonic acid (CSA, 99%), cesium iodide (CsI, 99.9%), lead iodide (PbI2, 99.9%), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous, 99.8%), poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT, with 85000–10000 wt), chlorobenzene (CB, anhydrous 99.8%) and all other chemicals including N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous, 99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All salts and solvents were used as received without further purification.
Inorganic perovskite precursor solution preparation
The CsPbI3 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving CsI and PbI2 (1:1 mmol) with a mixture of DMSO and DMF (4:6, v/v) as the solvent. The Ba2+-incorporated CsPbI3 perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.01 mol CsI and 0.01 mol (90/10 mol%) mixture of PbI2/BaI2 and CSA (2, 5, and 10 wt% of CsPb1−xBaxI3) in 1 mL of solvent with a mixture of DMSO and DMF (4:6, v/v). The final solution was stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The HTL solution was prepared by dissolving P3HT (10 mg) in 1 mL chlorobenzene and adding 10 μL of (4F-TCNQ-Sigma-Aldrich) in chlorobenzene (1 mg/1 mL).
Solar cell fabrication
Firstly, indium tin oxide (ITO) conducting glass was ultrasonically cleaned using detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 15 min each and then treated by a UV/O3 cleaner for 30 min. Then, a compact ∼20 nm thin SnO2 layer was spin-coated on the glass/ITO substrate followed by annealing at 150 °C for 15 min. After depositing the electron transport layer, the perovskite layer was deposited via a one-step spin-coating method using the 1 mM CsPbI3 precursor solution at the speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s followed by annealing at 60 °C for 1 min and then at 120 °C for 10 min. Then, an HTL layer of P3HT was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s at a ramp rate of 1000 rpm s−1. Finally, an 80 nm thick gold electrode as the top electrode was deposited through a shadow mask using thermal evaporation with an active area of 0.130 cm2.
Characterization and measurements
A digital source meter (Keithley 2635A) was used to measure the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the solar cells. The solar cell performance was measured under illumination by an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Apertures (13.0 mm2) made of thin metal were attached to each cell before the measurement of the J–V characteristics. The device stability was measured in time step. EQE measurements were obtained with a PV measurement QE system under ambient conditions, with monochromated light from a xenon arc lamp. The monochromatic light intensity was calibrated with an Si photodiode and chopped at 100 Hz. The absorption properties of the thin films were characterized by UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy (Carry 5000, Agilent), while thin film PL was measured with a fluorometer (Carry Eclipse, Agilent) excited at 450 nm. The surface morphologies of the perovskite with/without additive were analyzed by field emission SEM (Nova NanoSEM, FEI). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the thin films were measured using a 670-IR, Varian spectrometer. Crystallographic information was determined by high power XRD (MAX 2500V, Rigaku) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54059 Å) in the 2θ range of 10° to 60°. The chemical composition of the samples was investigated by XPS (K-alpha, ThermoFisher), while elemental composition distribution measurements were carried out in depth profiling mode using a TOF SIMS 5 (ION TOF) and the thickness of the samples was measured using a surface profiler (KLA Tencor).
Fabrication of light-emitting diodes
ITO substrates were cleaned using the abovementioned method and treated by a UV/O3 cleaner for 30 min. A poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) layer was deposited on the cleaned ITO substrates by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 40 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 15 min. On top of the PEDOT:PSS layer, the perovskite layer of CSA-2 in 1:1 molar ratio was spin-coated at 4000 rpm and annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Then a 100 nm thick TPBi layer was deposited through a shadow mask using thermal evaporation with an active area of 0.130 cm2. Finally, a 100 nm thick Al layer was deposited under vacuum (<106 Torr) using thermal evaporation.
Density functional theory calculations
DFT calculations were performed using the PBE exchange correlation functional33 and Tkatchenko–Scheffler (TS)34 van der Waals corrections in conjunction with PAW planewave basis sets of 500 eV energy cut-off in a (2 × 2 × 2) Γ-centered k-point mesh for the (3 × 3 × 3) supercell of cubic CsPbI3 using the VASP suite.
Result and discussion
To overcome the air and thermal stability issue, we introduced 2, 5, and 10 wt% of CSA in the CsPb0.90Ba0.10I3 precursor solution and studied their effects on the α-phase stability, crystal growth, air stability, thermal stability, and optical properties of the CsPbI3 perovskite. The thin films were sufficiently stable in humid conditions without encapsulation to record the absorption, PL, and lifetime data, whereas in earlier reports, encapsulation was used to characterize these properties. We also noticed that the simultaneous substitution of CSA and Ba (10 mol%) in the [PbI6]4− octahedra did not affect the absorption and emission properties significantly, with a bandgap of ∼1.72 eV, similar to that of α-CsPbI3.26 Moreover, this is the first report on the partial replacement of the B-site cation without any excess HI or Br− to stabilize α-CsPbI3. The schematic illustration in Fig. 1a–c shows the effect of different temperatures on the thin film characteristics during processing.
To elucidate the origin of the stability effect of BaI doping in α-CsPbI3, we calculated the formation energy of α-CsPbxBa(1−x)I3, Ef = E(CsPb(1−x)BaxI3) − xE(CsBaI3) − (1 − x)E(CsPbI3) using DFT by varying the BaI doping ratio x = 3.7%, 7.4%, 11.1%, 14.8, and 22.2%. We observed that Ef for α-CsPbxBa(1−x)I3 has the minimum at x = 11.1% (Fig. 1d), which is similar to the experimental BaI doping rate of 10%.
Experimentally, we found that excess HI accelerated the crystallization process and the thin films turned back to the yellow phase if annealed above 100 °C, and the partial substitution of Br− in CsPbI3 perovskite decreased the absorption range towards the UV-region, which directly limits the efficiency of PSCs. Fig. 2a shows that the orthorhombic CsPbI3 film processed at low temperature exhibited visible-light absorption below 450 nm, while the CSA-1, CSA-2, and CSA-3 samples absorbed light up to a wavelength of ∼720 nm and showed solid-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra (Fig. 2b). Also, the influence on crystal size and thin film morphology with varying concentrations of CSA and δ-CsPbI3 processed at low temperature was analyzed using the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images (Fig. 2c, top). The reference CsPbI3 thin film had inhomogeneous submicrometer-sized crystals with large-sized pinholes, while the CSA (1–3) rearranged the crystal grain size ranging ∼100–150 nm without any pinholes. The α-CsPbI3 PSCs suffered from pinholes,16,22–24,26 while pinhole-free thin films were obtained using CSA-2. The CSA-1 films were well crystallized, but suffered from insignificant pinholes, while the CSA-3 sample possessed undesired precipitation and tiny pinholes. The phase and photo stability of the thin films were observed for δ-CsPbI3, CSA-stabilized CsPbI3 and CSA-2 for over a year inside a glove box, as shown in Fig. S1.† The CSA-2 thin films maintained their α-phase, while only the CSA-stabilized thin films transformed back to the δ-phase.

To study the influence of the incorporated CSA and the effect of Ba-doping on the elemental composition on the surface of the CsPbI3 perovskite structure, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed.6,13,29,32,33 The Ba 3d5/2 and Ba 3d3/2 characteristic peaks at 780 and 795 eV, respectively, indicate the successful incorporation of Ba2+ inside the structure, and an increment in CSA concentration resulted in a decrease in the elemental peak intensities, as shown in Fig. 3d. It was observed that the CSA (1–3) films had only two characteristic peaks for Cs 3d, I 3d, Pb 4f and Ba 3d without any additional peaks, which indicates the absence of a mixed phase inside the crystal lattice. However, split peaks were present with the two characteristic peaks in previous reports for α-CsPbI3 films, which indicate the mixed phase inside the crystal lattice.25,34 The presence of lower binding energy doublets in the XPS spectrum of δ-CsPbI3 indicates the non-interacted Cs0, I0, and Pb0 reduced states and the non-perovskite phase.25 The CsPbI3 films processed at low temperature exhibited Cs 3d5/2 and Cs 3d3/2 peaks at 723.9 and 738 eV, respectively, while two additional peaks were observed at 726 and 740 eV (Fig. 3e). Also, the XPS spectrum of δ-CsPbI3 showed four I 3d characteristics peaks at 618.2, 621.1, 629.7 and 632.6 eV (Fig. 3f), which indicate the reduction of the Cs+ cation by the I− anion inside the structure, resulting in deformation of the cubic symmetry.35 The XPS spectrum of δ-CsPbI3 has two peaks of Pb4+ 4f7/2 and Pb4+ 4f5/2 at 139.3 and 144.2 eV,35 two signature peaks of Pb2+ 4f7/2 and Pb2+ 4f5/2 at 137.8 and 142.6 eV, and Pb0 4f7/2 and Pb0 4f5/2 peaks at 136.1 and 141.3 eV, respectively, which indicate the existence of different oxidation states of Pb inside the deformed crystal structure (Fig. 3g).13 The side peaks disappeared from the Cs 3d, I 3d, Pb 4f spectra of the CSA (1–3) films and also the peaks shift towards lower binding energies, which indicate an orthorhombic to cubic phase transformation (Fig. 3a–c).25,35 On the other hand, the CSA (1–3)-incorporated films have only two signature peaks of Pb2+ 4f7/2 and Pb2+ 4f5/2 at 136.9 and 141.8 eV, respectively, which indicate the cubic phase of the crystal lattice without the presence of an orthorhombic phase. Similarly, the binding energy of Cs 3d5/2 and Cs 3d3/2 shifted 0.60 eV towards a lower binding energy, but there were no side peaks in all the CSA (1–3) films, which indicate no obvious reduction or break in the cubic symmetry. The same phenomena of binding energy shifts were also observed in the I 3d and Pb 4f spectra, which indicate the partial substitution of Ba inside the crystal lattice.

Fitted results (e–g) of the low-temperature-processed CsPbI3 for (e) Cs 3d, (f) I 3d, and (g) Pb 4f. 
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy measurement was conducted to identify the interaction and potential mechanism for the CSA-stabilized α-CsPbI3 (Fig. S2†).26,36 The NMR spectrum of the precursor perovskite solution was compared with that of pure CSA dissolved in DMSO-d6 solution. The pure CSA exhibited a peak at δ = 4.39 ppm, which shifted downfield by Δδ = 3.11 ppm to δ = 7.5 ppm after interaction with the CsPbI3 precursor, indicating that the –SO3H group has strong interaction with CsPbI3. Practically, we observed that the CSA (1–3) films were more resistant to moisture than the CsPb1−xBaxI3 films. This motivated us to optimize the CSA concentration inside the inorganic perovskite precursor solution.
The in-depth dynamics of the resistance to moisture was verified via SEM, NMR, XPS, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) studies. Camphor sulphonic acid (CSA) strongly interacts with CsPbI3 in both solution and the solid-state, as confirmed from the SEM, NMR, XPS, and FTIR measurements. CSA slows down the crystallization process of CsPbI3 to grow small-grained CsPbI3 films, as observed in the SEM images (Fig. 2c). In the absence of CSA, the sizes of the CsPbI3 grains were much larger. In the XPS pattern, we observed peak shifts towards a lower energy for both the Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 peak positions, which indicate the strong interaction of CSA with the CsPb0.90Ba0.10I3 thin films. The NMR measurements confirmed that CSA strongly interacts with CsPbI3. FTIR spectroscopy was also performed to confirm the interaction of CSA with CsPbI3 in the solid-state thin films. The FTIR peak at around 995 cm−1 corresponds to the symmetric SO stretches of the sulphonate group (SO3−). In the CSA-incorporated CsPbI3 thin films, this peak shifted to a higher wavenumber of 1005 cm−1, which indicates the strong interaction of the oxygen element of SO3− and CsPbI3.16 CSA has two SO and one S–OH and the S–OH group loses its H+ ion in solution to form S–O−. The lone pair of the oxide ion can participate in resonance and the SO bond is weakened. However, as SO3− interacts with CsPbI3, the resonance is inhibited, and the SO bond strength increases. CSA is an organosulphur bridge compound and one of its bridgehead carbon atoms contains two methyl groups. The head part of CSA, i.e. SO3−, interacts with the perovskite moiety and the tail part, i.e. the hydrophobic alkyl part resists the moisture. Thus, CSA makes a strong barrier against moisture, improving the air stability of the CsPbI3 thin films. The effect of Ba-doping and CSA concentration on the crystal structure of the perovskite was characterized using high-power X-ray diffraction (HPXRD), as shown in Fig. 4a and S4.† We observed the characteristic peaks at 14.46°, 20.79° and 29.12° in the CSA-stabilized CsPbI3, while the Ba2+-doped thin films exhibited the characteristic peaks at 14.27°, 20.23° and 28.98°, which indicates the peaks shifted towards a lower 2θ value. The shift in the XRD peaks towards a lower 2θ value indicates the replacement of the smaller cation (Pb2+ with an ionic radius of 119 pm) with the larger cation (Ba2+ with an ionic radius of 135 pm). Also, BaI2 XRD peaks were absent in the Ba2+-doped CsPbI3, which indicates the complete incorporation of the Ba2+ cation inside the perovskite structure. Previously, the lattice strain induced by excess HI stabilized the cubic phase, and the grain size was reduced significantly to ∼100 nm, which was small compared to the submicrometer-sized grain of the films processed without HI.4,6,13,16,37,38 In this case, the lower ionization energy and strong lattice strain induced by CSA and Ba-doping stabilized the cubic phase of CsPbI3 at low temperature.

(c) PCE performance of the CsPbI3 perovskite device with different doping schemes (the results of the CSA (1–3) schemes are summarized in the inset table). (d) External quantum efficiency (EQE) of the CSA (1–3) schemes. 
Furthermore, the thin films of CsPbI3 and CSA (1–3) used for characterization were coated on glass substrates and annealed at 120 °C for 10 min. PMMA encapsulation was used to keep the films intact from moisture. Firstly, the yellow phase CsPbI3 film processed at low temperature exhibited the characteristic diffraction peaks of the orthorhombic phase with a space group of Pnma, while CSA-1, CSA-2 and CSA-3 exhibited α-CsPbI3 with the main diffraction peaks of 14.27°, 20.23° and 28.98°.29 The CSA-1 and CSA-3 films revealed the peaks of the (122) plane along with the (100), (111), and (200) planes, while CSA-2 exhibited only intense (100), (111), and (200) plane peaks, which signify the formation of a cubic structure.4,5,13,29,37 Finally, we observed that the CSA-2 films were more air-stable and thermally stable and had better surface morphology than the CSA-1 and CSA-3 films.
Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) data was recorded to analyze the effect of CSA concentration on carrier lifetime. The samples were prepared for δ-CsPbI3 and CSA (1–3), with the glass/perovskite configuration, where 300 ± 30 nm thick films excited at a wavelength of 450 nm were used without encapsulation (Fig. 4b). However, CsPbI3 processed at low temperature did not exhibit any PL, and thus it was not possible to record its carrier lifetime for comparison with the CSA (1–3) samples. The fast component (τ1) and slow component (τ2) indicate the presence of defect states and effective recombination lifetime, respectively.7,22 The trap state lifetimes in the CSA-1 and CSA-3 samples (3.066 and 2.473 ns, respectively) were relatively similar, while the trap state lifetime in CSA-2 increased to 5.973 ns (indicating an increase in the exciton recombination time). Similarly, τ2 increased from 5.905 ns for CSA-1 to 14.942 ns for CSA-2, which indicates the better surface passivation provided by CSA-2. The increase in τ2 to 4.809 ns for CSA-3 indicates a lower recombination lifetime. Finally, the results suggest that a increase the amount of CSA above CSA-2 had a detrimental effect on the surface passivation and carrier lifetime, and its consequences were also observed from the PSC results. The detailed lifetime results are shown in Table S1.† The average PL decay time (τavg) exhibited the improved charge dissociation and transport in CSA-2 compared with that in CSA-1 and CSA-3, which suggest that CSA-2 was the optimal sample for device fabrication.
To obtain chemical information and study the distribution of all the components in the inorganic perovskite, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) was used in three dimensions (a combination of high-resolution imaging with depth profiling). Information on the Cs, Pb, and Ba distribution throughout the perovskite layer deposited on a glass substrate via one-step solution process was obtained (Fig. S5†). The film thickness of the samples was ∼200 ± 50 nm. Standard profiling conditions were used with a 0.5 keV oxygen sputter beam (95–100 nA sputter current) for the perovskite layer. The distribution of Cs+ and Pb2+ cations was uniform throughout the film, while inhomogeneity in the Ba2+ distribution was observed from the depth profiling measurements in the CSA (1–3) samples (Fig. S6†), which is mainly because of the low ratio of Ba2+ to Pb2+ at the B-site.
Furthermore, the inorganic perovskite films were used as absorber materials to fabricate planar PSCs with the configuration of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/P3HT/Au. The deposition of an inorganic hole transport layer (HTL) material makes the fabrication process complicated for commercial application; thus, we used all-solution-based materials and the devices were processed below 150 °C. We fabricated the device with 2%, 5%, and 10% Ba doping, while optimizing the doping concentration with CSA additive. The PCE values of the devices with 2%, 5% and 10% Ba-doping concentration are shown in Fig. 4c and S7.† The devices with CSA-2 exhibited a significant PCE of 7.23%. Furthermore, the devices were stable inside a glove box and retained ∼98% of their initial PCE values even after 500 h of continuous white LED illumination, which indicated photo-stable and moisture-resistant PSCs (Fig. S8†). The stability of the devices was observed after exposing them to open air with 50–60% relative humidity at room temperature for 1 h, and the devices retained ∼99% of their initial value. The X-ray diffraction patterns were also recorded after one year for the thin films stored inside a glove box without encapsulation, as shown in Fig. S9.† To validate the characterization of the devices, the incident photo to current efficiency (IPCE) measurement was conducted using the best cells, and the results were in good agreement with the current density recorded from the current–voltage measurement (Fig. 4d). The performance of the best cells with different concentrations is summarized in Fig. 4c, where the CSA-2 PSCs exhibited the highest PCE values among the schemes, which is consistent with the XRD, TCSPC and FE-SEM results.
Furthermore, the optimized conditions for the perovskite material after the successful fabrication of solar cells were used to check its application in perovskite LEDs (PLEDs). The CSA-2 perovskite thin films have a homogenous crystal grain size of ∼100 nm, which motivated us to check their possible application in PLEDs with bulk material properties. We successfully fabricated PLED devices with the conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/TPBi/LiF/Al to evaluate the performance of CSA-2 as a light emitter. A red-light-emission was observed at 700 nm with an FWHM of 39 nm, exhibiting a narrow emission region (Fig. 5b and c). We also achieved a turn-on voltage of 7 V (@ 0.1 cd m−2) (Fig. 5b), and the PLEDs showed the maximum brightness and EQE of 2.17 cd m−2 and 0.04%, respectively (Fig. 5a). The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) coordinates for the fabricated device are shown in Fig. 5d. Although we did not consider the CsPbI3 energy band alignment with the transporting materials, we observed a red-light-emission. Thus, improvements can be made by selecting the appropriate transporting materials. From this experiment, we observed that Ba-doped CsPbI3 is a strong candidate for application in future tandem solar cells and optoelectronic devices.

Conclusions
In summary, for the first time, we successfully stabilized α-CsPbI3 by incorporating the optimal content of barium (∼10%), which well-matches the DFT calculations and exhibited thermally and photo stable films without compromising the optical properties. Initially, we observed that the Ba-doped thin films without CSA had poor air stability. Subsequently, we incorporated CSA and found that it improved the air stability. We performed HPXRD characterization in open air and observed that the thin films with Ba degraded immediately upon air exposure, while the CSA-2 samples were stable in air. Furthermore, the thin films were stable under ambient conditions for one year. Typical solution-processed planar PSCs and PLEDs were fabricated without encapsulation to validate the applicability of CSA-2. The active layer deposited via one-step solution processing exhibited better thermal, photo, phase, and air stability and the PSCs exhibited impressive power conversion efficiency. The fabricated devices were exposed to open air with 50–60% relative humidity for ∼1 h, and retained 99% of their initial values. Interestingly, the fabricated PSCs retained high stability and attained ∼98% of their initial value even after 700 h, which strongly support the non-volatile behavior of the CsPbI3 perovskite and its future potential applications. Also, PLEDs were fabricated using the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/TPBi/LiF/Al structure, which exhibited a red-light emission at 700 nm. The combination of surface passivation and metal substitution offers better air and thermal stability, which opens a new direction for highly stable perovskite optoelectronics devices.
