    , Accepted 2nd July 2021First published on 5th July 2021AbstractTin perovskites with a narrow bandgap and high carrier mobility are highly attractive for environmentally friendly perovskite solar cells (PSCs), but the Sn-based PSCs are still less efficient and stable owing to the less perfect tin perovskite films. Here, we report a simple and efficient method to produce high-quality FASnI3 films by establishing a solvent vapor environment without using additional additives to manipulate both the nucleation and crystal growth of perovskites at the very early stage of perovskite formation. The smooth morphology, large grain size and low trap state density of the tin perovskite films in preferred orientations were realized. Sn-based inverted PSCs show power conversion efficiency over 10% along with high device stability that retains 83 and 82% of initial performances for 600 h under continuous illumination and for 1000 h in a N2 environment. These performances, which are among the best results of FASnI3-based PSCs, demonstrate the impressive advantages of the vapor-incubation strategy in preparing preferred perovskite films for high-performance lead-free devices.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn enormous attention from the photovoltaic community owing to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 25.5%,1,2 but the involvement of lead, which is a cumulative toxicant to humans, hampers the pace of their future large-scale application.3–8 Various efforts have been made to develop lead-free PSCs by replacing Pb2+ with environmentally benign elements, including the other Group 14 congeners to retain the three-dimensional (3D) perovskite framework9 and cations containing inactive outer shell s orbitals such as Cu2+, Sb3+, Bi3+, etc. for two-dimensional (2D) perovskite derivatives of Cs3Sb2I9,10 molecular Cs3Bi2I9,11 and ordered double perovskites of Cs2AgBiX6 (ref. 7) and Cs2Sn1−xI6 (ref. 12). Among them, the Sn-based halide perovskites are most promising in light of their suitable band gap (1.2–1.4 eV), low exciton-binding energy (18 meV), high carrier mobility (∼100–1000 cm2 V−1 s−1) and encouraging device performance.13–15 Nevertheless, their main drawbacks are also obvious, ranging from (1) instability and poor reproducibility due to the easy oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+, (2) high p-type carrier concentration owing to the low formation energy of Sn vacancies, (3) large trap state density resulting from the fast crystallization in forming abundant vacancies and the rough morphology of the perovskite films. Therefore, the high dark current, serious charge recombination and large energy loss for inferior PCEs and stability are generally observed in Sn-based devices in comparison to those of the lead-based PSCs.16,17
To address these drawbacks, a fundamental solution is to fabricate ideal perovskite crystal films. Since organic cations (FA+) and iodide ions (I−) in the Sn-based perovskite precursor may be volatilized before integrating into the interstitial sites of perovskite frameworks, fast nucleation is preferred to achieve stoichiometric perovskite films with a low trap state density and a smooth morphology.18 Meanwhile, according to Wulff construction theory, the slow crystal growth rate of perovskites will be helpful for the formation of high quality perovskite crystals with crystallization oriented in specific directions. Thus, fast nucleation and slow crystal growth are generally required to produce high-quality Sn-based perovskite films.19 Hao et al. employed dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to form a SnI2·3DMSO intermediate phase to slow down the crystallization rate of the FASnI3 perovskite, leading to uniform and pinhole-free films for PSCs with PCEs up to 3.15%.20 Wang et al. added a small amount of ammonium thiocyanate (NH4SCN) as a “catalyst” to manipulate the crystal growth of perovskite with parallel orientation on the film surface; thus, a constructed 2D-quasi–2D–3D hierarchical perovskite structure shows great resistance to oxidation and a PCE of 9.41%.21 Long-chain ammonium cations have also been used as additives to obtain highly oriented mixed 2D–3D perovskite films, which not only promote the charge transport but also passivate or reduce the trap state density for PCEs up to 9.61%.22–26 It has been proved that the interaction between the perovskite precursor and the additive plays a vital role in stabilizing the intermediate phase for achieving improved perovskite film quality by manipulating the crystal growth, resulting in superior device performance and stability. However, there still remains a formidable challenge to tune the nucleation process of the perovskite crystal, which is very fast and difficult to be regulated, especially for the Sn-based perovskites. The recent reports show that the nucleation of Sn-based perovskites happens at the beginning of the spin-coating process and starts at the liquid–gas interface;27,28 the homogeneous nucleation in the perovskite precursor could generate random crystal orientation due to the isotropic parent phase,29 while the heterogeneous nucleation at the liquid–gas surface leads to a preferred crystal orientation.30 So far, few strategies are applicable to modulate the crystallization kinetics of tin perovskite at the very beginning of the spin-coating without using additional additives except for the must have one of SnF2.
Herein, we propose a novel vapor incubation (VI) method to manipulate both the nucleation and growth of perovskite's crystallization for producing high-quality FASnI3 films, in sharp contrast to the conventional defect healing and passivation strategies. Compared to the additives in either solid or liquid states, the VI method incubates the crystallization of the perovskite without introducing or leaving any substance in the active layer that may induce unfavorable effects on the performance of PSCs (such as the hysteresis behavior13,26). The established liquid–gas–vapor surface can effectively monitor the crystallization processes for fast nucleation and slow growth of the FASnI3 perovskite films in preferred crystal orientation with a large grain size and a reduced trap state density. Therefore, the VI-treated Sn-based perovskites show increased charge mobility and suppressed non-radiative recombination for high-performance lead-free inverted PSCs with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of up to 0.62 V and a PCE of 10.8%. More impressively, these devices show negligible hysteresis and high device stability with less than 18% decay in efficiency under continuous one sun illumination at maximum power point (MPP) tracking for 600 h. These results, which are among the best performance reported so far in the lead-free PSCs, illustrate the great potential of the additive-free VI strategy for simultaneously controlling the crystal nucleation and growth of Sn-based perovskites for high-quality FASnI3 films and high-performance lead-free PSCs.
Results and discussion
To generate a weak polar solvent vapor for VI treatment, ethyl acetate (EA) with high volatility (14.9 kPa at 25 °C) and suitable polarity (∼4.3) close to that of perovskite (∼4.5) was chosen, since the hybrid perovskite has high solubility in strong polar solvents (polarity > 4.5) and little solubility in low polar solvents, thus the low polar EA vapor provides a supersaturated driving force for the nucleation process (Fig. 1a). In addition, the low boiling point (77 °C) of EA enables its facile removal by thermal annealing. Conveniently, EA vapor was produced by spinning a certain amount (3.0 mL) of EA on a blank glass substrate. During the spinning, the spin coater's chamber is open. In the EA vapor environment, the FASnI3 precursor in a mixed solution of dimethyl formamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (v/v = 4:1, 1.0 mol L−1) was spin-coated on the surface of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)-covered indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrate (ITO/PEDOT:PSS). Similar to the conventional fabrication processes, the wet-FASnI3 film was also treated with the antisolvent chlorobenzene (CB) to produce a dense and uniform perovskite crystal film followed by 70 °C annealing for 10 min to remove residual solvents and promote further crystallization. Compared to the solvent annealing method which has been widely reported to improve the film morphology,31 the VI method uses weak polar solvent vapor during spin-coating to manipulate both the nucleation and growth of perovskite' crystallization. Traditional thermal annealing was applied conveniently after spin-coating of the perovskite film. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the crystal process of perovskite was controlled effectively at the earliest stage of its formation by this VI method.

With this facile and convenient VI method, the inverted p–i–n Sn-based PSCs in a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/FASnI3/C60/BCP/Al (Fig. 1b and S1†) were fabricated, where PEDOT:PSS functions as a hole transport layer, while C60 and bathocuproine (BCP) serve as the electron transport and injection materials, respectively. Control PSCs with the same device structure but without VI treatment were also prepared by normal procedures for comparison studies. From the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics (Fig. 1c and Table 1), the control device exhibits a PCE of 6.3% with the Voc and short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 0.45 V and 22.1 mA cm−2, respectively. Excitingly, the VI-derived PSC reaches a much higher PCE of 10.8% under AM1.5 illumination accompanied by the significantly enlarged Voc and Jsc to 0.62 V and 24.2 mA cm−2, respectively. These performances are among the best results obtained for the lead-free PSCs (Table S1†). The much increased Voc from 0.45 to 0.62 V and Jsc from 22.1 to 24.2 mA cm−2 should be due to the reduced non-radiative recombination and increased charge mobility of the FASnI3 films after the VI treatment.26 The integrated Jsc from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum (Fig. 1d) agrees well with the measured Jsc from J–V curves. In comparison with the device based on the control film (Fig. S2†), the VI-derived device shows negligible hysteresis from the almost identical J–V curves in reverse and forward scans with a hysteresis factor of 0.01 owing to the significantly improved perovskite film quality (Fig. 1e).

The VI-derived devices also have excellent reliability and reproducibility. From the steady-state PCE measurement, very stable power output with the stabilized Jsc of 20.8 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 9.9% upon constant illumination at the maximum power point (0.47 V) for 100 s was observed (Fig. 1f). The statistical measurements based on 24 individual PSCs (Fig. 1g and S3†) indicate that the VI method has good reproducibility in greatly improving the PCEs of the inverted Sn-based PSCs with an average PCE of 9.0%, which is significantly higher than that of the conventional control devices (4.7%). We further investigated the effect of EA vapor concentration on the film properties and device performance by varying the delay time between the pre-spinning of EA vapor and spinning of the perovskite precursor (Table S2 and Fig. S4 and S5†). We found that the vapor concentration could be adjusted by the delay time, considering that EA vapor will diffuse into the surrounding atmosphere for a decreased EA vapor concentration after its spinning and different EA vapor concentrations will be obtained after different delay times. The results show that there is an optimal time, which is 2 h, to get the best film property and the highest device performance. In addition, the device performance was quite close to the delay time around 2.0 ± 0.5 h, which is helpful to improve the reproducibility of the PSCs.
We tried to use EA and mixture solvents containing EA as the antisolvent to fabricate Sn-based perovskite films. The device performances are shown in Table S3.† It can be found that the Sn-based PSC based on EA antisolvent has much lower PCE (2.85%) than that based on the widely used chlorobenzene antisolvent. The device performance based on the mixed solvent is comparable to that of the control device but is much lower than that of the VI-derived device. Thus, the device performance is not attractive enough when EA is used as the antisolvent. It is crucial to control the crystal process of perovskite at the very beginning of the spin-coating for high quality perovskite films. CB antisolvent is also a weak polar solvent with low volatility (1.33 kPa at 20 °C), which could also generate a small amount of solvent vapor. To investigate whether CB vapor has an effect on the device performance, we produce the vapor by spinning 3.0 mL of CB on a blank glass substrate to fabricate Sn-based perovskite films. From the J–V curves, the PSC based on CB vapor treatment reaches a PCE of 6.6% under AM1.5 illumination (Fig. S6†), which shows negligible increase compared with the control device (6.3%) and is much lower than that of the EA-derived device (10.8%). These results indicate that the CB vapor has little effect on the crystallization processes of perovskite. To explore the universality of this VI method, other low-polarity solvents (such as trichloromethane, isopropanol and methylbenzene) were tested. The polarity values of trichloromethane, isopropanol and methylbenzene are ∼4.3, 4.2 and 2.5, respectively. From the J–V curves, it can be found that the VI-derived PSCs based on these weak polar solvents all show higher PCEs than that of the control device (Fig. S7†). The maximum PCE of the device based on isopropanol reaches 7.5%, exhibiting 19% improvement. Therefore, the VI method should be a universal approach to incubate high-quality perovskite films for high-performance lead-free devices. To investigate whether EA vapor has an effect on the annealing process, the perovskite films were annealing under different conditions (Table S4†). The device performances show a negligible difference with or without EA vapor during annealing, demonstrating that VI treatment has little effect on the annealing process.
Considering the low boiling point and the high volatility of EA that can be facilely removed, the VI-derived PSCs should have an identical perovskite composition to the control devices but with very different crystallization structures and film qualities. Thus, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out to explore the effects of VI treatment on the FASnI3 perovskite crystal (Fig. 2a and b). Indeed, before chlorobenzene dripping and thermal annealing, the wet perovskite films prepared by either normal or VI method exhibit similar XRD peaks at 14.1°, 24.4°, 28.2°, 31.6°, 40.4°, and 42.9° (Fig. 2a), which can be indexed to the (100), (120), (200), (122), (222), and (231) crystal planes of the FASnI3 crystal;32 but the VI-treated wet perovskite film shows higher intensities of (100) and (200) peaks (I(100) and I(200)) compared to these of the control sample, demonstrating the formation of highly ordered FASnI3 seeds along the [100] or [200] direction. The VI-treated films without CB antisolvent dripping still show high crystallinity due to the fact that the EA vapor accelerates the nucleation process and induces crystallization with highly ordered FASnI3 seeds (Fig. S8a†). After chlorobenzene dripping and thermal annealing, the intensity of VI-treated perovskite films significantly increases due to further crystallization (Fig. S8b†). The VI-treated FASnI3 film after thermal annealing also shows significantly enhanced I(100) and I(200) compared to the (120) peak intensity (I(120)) with much increased I(100)/I(120) from 0.89 (control perovskite film) to 2.60, suggesting the preferred crystal orientation along the [100] or [200] direction by the VI treatment. It should be noted that the (h00) crystal planes of the FASnI3 film have the most favorable orientation for high-performance Sn-based PSCs.33 This better crystallization of the perovskite film in a preferred orientation is an important reason for the higher device performance of the VI-derived lead-free PSCs.

We then performed scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization to investigate the effects of VI treatment on the film quality of FASnI3 crystals (Fig. 2c–h). Without chlorobenzene dripping, the VI-treated perovskite film exhibits much smaller crystals, indicating that the VI treatment significantly accelerates the nucleation process of the FASnI3 crystal (Fig. 2c and d). With chlorobenzene dripping, the normally treated FASnI3 crystals in the control sample almost cover the whole substrate due to the fast crystallization (Fig. 2e), which lacks both space and time for crystal growth by annealing. Therefore, the small holes could not disappear after annealing (Fig. 2e and g). However, in the case of VI treatment, the crystal growth rate of the VI-treated FASnI3 film is retarded; still there has been numerous wide gaps between the crystals (Fig. 2f). Thus, the larger wide gaps could spare both space and time for crystal growth to form large grains during annealing without micro-grade holes (Fig. 2h). Therefore, the newly proposed VI method can effectively manipulate the crystallization of FASnI3 films for faster nucleation and slower crystal growth, which is ideal for producing high-quality perovskite films.32 Indeed, a high quality pin-hole-free perovskite film with the large average grain size of 700 nm was observed after the VI treatment, which is much better than the control film showing small grains with an average size of 580 nm (Fig. S9†) and poor film coverage with obvious pin-holes (Fig. 2g and h). More interestingly, regardless of the larger grain size of the VI-treated crystal, a smoother FASnI3 film was revealed by an atomic force microscopy (AFM) study on a 3.5 × 3.5 μm2 scanning scale (Fig. S10†). The RMS value of the VI-treated FASnI3 film is 23.2 nm, which is much smaller than that of the control film (28.9 nm). The enlarged crystal grains but reduced RMS of the perovskite film are beneficial to suppress the non-radiative charge recombination, which should be the important reason for the higher Voc of the VI-derived PSCs.33
With these observations, a possible perovskite crystallization mechanism can be proposed to understand these extraordinary manipulation effects of the VI method on the FASnI3 film. Generally, without VI treatment, the FASnI3 seeds will be generated randomly after the evaporation of DMF and DMSO solvents, resulting in a perovskite film with random orientation and a small grain microstructure after the thermal annealing process. In the case of VI treatment, the solvent of the perovskite precursor will diffuse into air and the EA vapor in air may also enter the perovskite solution through the liquid–gas interface. This is because perovskite has a low solubility in EA solvent (Fig. S11†) and is almost completely insoluble in chlorobenzene but shows much higher solubility in the mixture solvent of DMF and DMSO. Before chlorobenzene dripping, EA vapor can extract the DMSO and DMF in the wet perovskite film, resulting in a saturated perovskite precursor solution, which accelerates the nucleation process of the FASnI3 perovskite (Fig. 2i), which is consistent with the recent findings on controlling the FASnI3 crystallization process using a tailor-made fluorinated organic cation.27 But, after chlorobenzene dripping, the perovskite precursor solution becomes supersaturated due to chlorobenzene antisolvent extraction, and EA vapor can partly dissolve the perovskite crystal at this moment to retard the crystal growth. Small sized perovskite crystals will be dissolved to stimulate the growth of crystal seeds into larger grains following the Ostwald ripening principle (Fig. 2j),34 resulting in reduced crystal growth for enlarged crystal size and improved morphology of the perovskite film for high-performance PSCs. This observation is well in line with the previous reports.27 According to Wulff construction theorem, the high-energy crystal planes grow faster and their surface areas become smaller and eventually crystals are enclosed by lower energy planes.27 The formation of the (100) crystal plane of VI-treated perovskite was energetically more favorable during crystal growth, suggesting the decreased surface energy of (100) planes. Thus, the surface energy of the (100) plane should be significantly reduced compared to the other planes when EA vapor was introduced at the liquid–gas surface of the wet perovskite film. Therefore, the high-quality FASnI3 perovskite film can be effectively incubated in EA vapor in preferred [100] and [200] directions.
To further investigate the origin of the improved photovoltaics of the VI-treated high-quality FASnI3 film, the photophysical and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite were investigated. From the photo-absorption spectra (Fig. S12†), stronger absorbance, especially in the range from 400 to 550 nm, was observed in the VI-treated perovskite film, suggesting its improved light-harvesting ability for the high Jsc of the Sn-based PSCs.35 Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra also indicate a higher crystal quality of the VI-treated FASnI3 film (Fig. 3a), showing about 78% higher emission intensity (around 908 nm) than that of the control sample. The carrier lifetimes were also characterized by the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements (Fig. S13†). The decay lifetimes of control and VI-treated FASnI3 films were 4.49 and 5.50 ns, indicating lower trap-state density in the VI-treated FASnI3 films. Moreover, light-intensity (I) dependent Voc curves were employed to evaluate the effect of charge recombination losses on the devices (Fig. 3b). In the open-circuit condition, Voc was determined by the equation:36  where n and q represent ideality factors related to the rates of charge carrier recombination and the elementary charge, respectively; Jph and J0 are the photocurrent density and the reversed saturate current density, respectively. It was found that the logarithmic Voc can be linearly fitted with slopes of 1.87kT/q for the control PSC and 1.46kT/q for the VI-derived one. The smaller slope means a lower trap-assisted recombination, which leads to higher Voc and PCE of the VI-derived PSCs.37 In addition, almost 1 order of lower dark current density was observed in the VI-treated devices compared to that of the control PSCs (Fig. S14†), indicating the greatly suppressed current leakage by the VI treatment.33 Therefore, the VI method can greatly improve the crystal quality of the FASnI3 film with a low defect/trap density for enhanced photo-absorption and PL intensity and thus the reduced current leakage increased the Voc and improved the PCE of their PSCs.

We also try to identify the trap state density of the FASnI3 film by space charge limit current (SCLC) analysis performed on the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/FASnI3/MoO3/Al (Fig. S15†). The obtained dark J–V curves (Fig. 3c and d) include three typical regions of the ohmic (green), trap filling limited (TFL, in orange) and child regions (blue). Based on J–V curves of the former two regions, the trap state density can be calculated by the following equation:38  where ε0 is the relative dielectric constant, ε is the vacuum permittivity, VTFL is the trap filling limited voltages, and L is the film thickness. From the cross section of ohmic and TFL regions, VTFL for VI-treated and control FASnI3 films are 0.56 and 0.91 V, respectively. The corresponding trap state densities were calculated to be 8.51 × 1016 and 1.38 × 1017 cm−3, respectively. The reduced trap state density of the VI-treated FASnI3 film suggests its high crystal quality to suppress the ion migration and hysteresis behaviors, leading to a better device performance of the VI-derived PSCs. Also, the charge mobility (μ) can be achieved by fitting the child region using the SCLC model in the following equation:36  
The child region of Fig. 3d satisfies J ∝ V2 (Fig. S16†). The measured hole mobility of the VI-treated FASnI3 film (1.14 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is much higher than that of the normal one (5.66 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). In addition, from the Nyquist plots of the PSCs fitted by the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) (Fig. S17†), the recombination resistance (Rrec) of the VI-derived device is almost four times higher than that of control device at an applied voltage of 0.4 V, implying the much higher charge extraction and lower charge recombination rates of the perovskite film by the VI treatment. The high Rrec at the high applied bias results in a high Voc, as observed experimentally,26,39 contributing again to the high performance of the VI-derived PSCs (Fig. 1c).
We further investigated the Sn4+ content in the VI-treated FASnI3 film using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. 3e and f). The fitting parameters of the XPS spectrum are provided in Table S5.† The narrow XPS peak of Sn corresponds to two different oxidation states that can be well fitted with a Gaussian function, and the Sn2+:Sn4+ ratio in the VI-derived film is 3.30, which is much higher than that (1.88) obtained by the conventional treatment in the control experiment. The much reduced Sn2+ oxidization in the VI-treated FASnI3 film significantly improves the stability of the Sn-based PSCs (Fig. 4 and S18†). From the stability test of the unencapsulated VI-derived PSCs in a N2 atmosphere (Fig. 4a), the efficiency of control PSC decays to 48% of its initial PCE after 1000 h, while the VI-derived PSC retains >82% of its original PCE, confirming that the VI method can improve not only the PCE but also the stability. In addition, the VI-derived PSC also shows high stability under one sun illumination operating at MPP tracking (Fig. 4b), maintaining 83% of its initial efficiency for 600 h, while the control device undergoes fast degradation. The stability of the VI-derived device is comparable to the state of the art of the recently reported Sn-based PSCs (Table S6†). We attribute the improved stability of VI-derived PSCs to the suppressed charge recombination that occurs at the vacancy, interstitial, and antisite defects,19 resulting in local heating, triggering the propagation and accumulation of the trap states, and inducing lattice distortion, phase separation and decomposition of the perovskite. Therefore, the VI method can modulate the crystallization of the perovskite for high-quality perovskite films with low trap states, leading to significantly improved device stability.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we develop a facile and low-cost additive-free VI method to prepare high-quality FASnI3 films for high-performance lead-free PSCs. The weak polar solvent molecules of EA may penetrate the perovskite precursor solution through the liquid–gas surface, which promotes the perovskite nucleation; while the part solubility of EA towards FASnI3 could retard the crystal growth rate and induce efficient Ostwald ripening for the crystal growth in large grains with a high degree of preferential orientation of the FASnI3 film along the [100] and [200] directions. Therefore, the first proposed VI treatment is efficient in enlarging the grain size, reducing the trap state, increasing the charge mobility and suppressing the non-radiative recombination of the FASnI3 film. As a result, the VI-derived Sn-based PSCs reach high PCEs over 10% with significantly improved Voc from 0.45 to 0.62 V. Moreover, the VI-derived PSCs exhibit remarkable stability with less than 18% decay in efficiency for 1000 h without encapsulation. We consider that this new-concept VI strategy represents an important step forward towards gaining a fundamental understanding of and rationally manipulating the perovskite crystallization for ideal photovoltaic films, paving the way to construct additive-free high-quality perovskite films and highly efficient and stable lead-free PSCs.
