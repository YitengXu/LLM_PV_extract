    , Accepted 14th November 2021First published on 15th November 2021AbstractCsPbIBr2 has attracted intense attention as an absorber material of all-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs), owing to its upgraded stability and suitable bandgap. Yet, the efficiency level of CsPbIBr2 PSCs is still far below those of other all-inorganic PSCs, largely because of the inferior morphology and crystallization properties of solution-processed CsPbIBr2 films. Herein, we propose for the first time an in situ polymer-covered annealing strategy to modify the crystallization behavior of one-step-deposited CsPbIBr2 film, which is performed through spin-coating of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) solution upon CsPbIBr2 precursor film before annealing. By optimizing the concentration of PMMA solution, a CsPbIBr2 film with large-size grains, [110]-preferred orientation, reduced halide segregation, stoichiometric composition, and decreased non-radiative recombination can be acquired, which lead to the improved transport and suppressed non-radiative recombination of charge carriers for the resulting PSC. Hence, the optimum carbon-electrode PSC exhibits a significantly enhanced efficiency from 8.71% to 10.50%, which is better than that of nearly all the CsPbIBr2 PSCs with the same configuration reported earlier.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have developed as one of the promising candidates for photovoltaic system, in view of their high performance, low-cost raw materials, and simple fabrication.1,2 Recently, a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.6%, coupled with substantial improvement in operation reliability, has been achieved for PSCs.2,3 However, the state-of-the-art PSCs are generally built with organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials that contain volatile organic cations, such as methylammonium (MA+) or formamidinium (FA+),2,3 inevitably resulting in poor thermostability and photostability.4 Such a critical issue motivates researchers to shift their attention toward inorganic alternatives (CsPbX3, X = I, Br, Cl, or their mixtures) that exhibit substantially upgraded abilities against thermal and light stresses.5–7
Up to now, the inorganic perovskites developed for PSCs mainly include CsPbI3, CsPbI2Br, CsPbIBr2, and CsPbBr3.6,8 By comparison, they exhibit some obvious advantages and shortcomings, in terms of PSC applications. For example, CsPbI3 with a bandgap of ∼1.73 eV can enable PSCs with the highest thseoretical PCE.9 However, it suffers from severe phase instability because the black α-phase CsPbI3 is only stable above 330 °C; such a desired phase structure can spontaneously transform into the non-photoactive phase (δ-CsPbI3) at room temperature.10 CsPbBr3 shows excellent phase stability and notable tolerance to heat and humidity stresses, but the wide bandgap of 2.3 eV confines its sunlight absorption capacity, leading to low photocurrents of resulting PSCs.11 The mixed-halide inorganic perovskites retain the relatively balanced properties in terms of bandgap and phase stability, compared with CsPbBr3 and CsPbI3.7 To be specific, CsPbI2Br exhibits a narrower bandgap of 1.92 eV than CsPbBr3 and a better phase stability than CsPbI3, but it is also sensitive to high humidity and/or temperature.12,13 Further increasing the proportion of Br− anions contributes to the enhanced stability of the mixed-halide inorganic perovskites. Therefore, CsPbIBr2 with an appropriate bandgap of ∼2.1 eV and satisfactory stability seems to be a good choice as the absorber material for PSCs.14–17
Despite the well-balanced structural stability and bandgap of CsPbIBr2, the best PCE of the corresponding PSCs is still far from the theoretical value as well as the ones of PSCs based on other inorganic perovskite materials.18,19 Such a discrepancy is largely ascribed to the poor quality of solution-processed CsPbIBr2 films, wherein plenty of pinholes and small grains are easily observed.14,16,19–22 Meanwhile, the halide phase segregation is widespread in most CsPbIBr2 films.23–25 It has demonstrated that the halide phase segregation can produce plenty of moveable ions that travel along grain boundaries and further lead to CsPbIBr2 to deviate from its inherent properties, finally degrading the performance of PSCs.23–26 To overcome these serious drawbacks faced by solution-processed CsPbIBr2 films, a variety of innovative strategies have been proposed, such as precursor engineering,27,28 crystallization regulation,16,19,22,29 interface modification,18,30 elemental doping,31,32etc. Based on them, the record PCE of CsPbIBr2 PSCs has been boosted up to over 11%.18 However, the current routes for preparing CsPbIBr2 films lack synthetic control over their microstructure and crystallinity, which hinders the further performance optimization of related PSCs.
In general, the annealing recipe plays a key role in determining the quality of perovskite film. A compact, high-crystallinity, and homogeneous perovskite film can be obtained by carefully regulating the crystal nucleation, grain growth, and grain coarsening stages.33,34 For example, a two-stage annealing strategy is demonstrated to be conducive to reducing the pinholes in CsPbIBr2 films and thus improved PCEs of PSCs can be realized.35,36 Zhu et al.37 demonstrated that an enhanced performance of PSCs can be achieved by optimizing the post-annealing temperature of CsPbIBr2 films. In our previous work, we found that full-coverage, pure-phase CsPbIBr2 films featuring large grains, high crystallinity, preferential [100] grain orientation, along with favorable electronic structure can be formed, with the assistance of AM 1.5G illumination before thermal annealing, which enables a CsPbIBr2 PSC with a record-high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.283 V.21
In this work, we demonstrate an in situ polymer-covered annealing strategy to modulate the crystallization dynamics of CsPbIBr2 films, which is achieved by spin-coating of PMMA solution onto CsPbIBr2 precursor films before annealing. By optimizing the concentration of PMMA, CsPbIBr2 films with large-sized grains, [110]-preferred orientation, suppressed halide segregation, stoichiometric composition, and reduced non-radiative recombination can be obtained successfully. As a result, the carbon-electrode PSCs fabricated with these desired CsPbIBr2 films yield an optimized PCE of 10.50%, which is much higher than the best one of PSCs prepared by traditional annealing method with a value of 8.71% and exceeds the PCE of nearly all the carbon-electrode CsPbIBr2 PSCs reported earlier.14,23,30,36,38–43
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) illustrates the main experimental procedures for the in situ polymer-covered annealing strategy. Firstly, 120 μL of 1 M CsPbIBr2 precursor was spin-coated upon FTO/TiO2 substrate to produce the precursor film. Next, 50 μL of PMMA solution with a concentration of 1, 3, or 5 mg mL−1 was spin-coated onto the precursor film, wherein chlorobenzene was used as the solvent of PMMA. After that, a PMMA thin layer can be formed in situ, and its thickness can be controlled by adjusting the concentration of PMMA solution in principle. The thickness values of PMMA layers were estimated to be ∼2, 5 and 7 nm by a step profiler, when the 1, 3, and 5 mg mL−1 PMMA solutions were used, respectively. Finally, the PMMA-covered CsPbIBr2 precursor film was pre-heated at 60 °C for 2 min and further annealed at 280 °C for 15 min to obtain a crystalline CsPbIBr2 film. The CsPbIBr2 films produced with 1, 3, and 5 mg mL−1 PMMA were denoted as 1 mg mL−1, 3 mg mL−1, and 5 mg mL−1, respectively. For comparison, a CsPbIBr2 film prepared with 0 mg mL−1 PMMA, namely the conventional annealing method, was considered as the control sample and labeled as 0 mg mL−1.23
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic of experimental procedures of the in situ polymer-covered annealing strategy. (b–e) High-resolution SEM images of CsPbIBr2 films prepared with 0, 1, 3, and 5 mg mL−1 PMMA, respectively. 
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of CsPbIBr2 films prepared with 0, 1, 3, and 5 mg mL−1 PMMA are provided in Fig. 1(b, c) and Fig. S1 (ESI†). All the films are compact, and no pinholes can be observed, which is in favor of avoiding the formation of shutting paths in ultimate PSCs.14 By comparison, the grains of CsPbIBr2 films produced by the in situ polymer-covered annealing method exhibit a flatter surface topography than the control sample, which may be related their different grain orientations, as discussed below. In addition, one can see that the grains in CsPbIBr2 films prepared by in situ polymer-covered annealing are slightly larger than those in the control sample. And, the average grain sizes are estimated to be 447, 589, 626, and 713 nm for the CsPbIBr2 films prepared with 0, 1, 3, and 5 mg mL−1 PMMA, respectively. The larger-size grains of a CsPbIBr2 film mean fewer grain boundaries, and thereby the weaker non-radiative recombination of charge carriers in final PSC.16,44 Thus, it is expected that the in situ polymer-covered annealing method may lead to CsPbIBr2 PSCs with better performance.
Crystallographic properties of the as-obtained CsPbIBr2 films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), with the results shown in Fig. 2(a). The XRD peaks at 2θ = 15.4°, 21.7°, 27.0°, 30.6°, 34.1°, and 37.5° can be detected for all the CsPbIBr2 films, which are in line with those of (100), (110), (111), (200), (210), and (211) crystal planes of perovskite CsPbIBr2 with a cubic phase.14,17 And, no impurity phase can be identified, which means that all the films are composed of pure-phase perovskite CsPbIBr2. Meanwhile, it is observed that the (100) diffraction peak is dominant in the control sample, revealing the [100]-preferred orientation of grains in it.14,45 However, for the CsPbIBr2 films prepared with 1, 3, and 5 mg mL−1 PMMA solution, the (110) diffraction peaks become dominant, which means that the grains possess the [110]-preferred orientation in these films. The CsPbIBr2 films generally have the [100]-preferred orientation in previous reports, and thus the optoelectronic properties of CsPbIBr2 films with other preferred orientations are rarely studied.16,22,29 However, the previous works focused on CsPbBr3 materials have disclosed that the [110]-preferred orientation is beneficial for charge carrier transport and light harvesting.46,47 In this case, we expect that the CsPbIBr2 films prepared by the in situ polymer-covered annealing strategy may have improved optoelectronic properties. In addition, one can note that the (110) diffraction peak intensifies with increasing concentration of PMMA solution, suggesting the improved crystallinity of the CsPbIBr2 film. Together, the XRD results indicate that based on the in situ polymer-covered annealing strategy, pure-phase, [110]-oriented CsPbIBr2 film can be obtained, and its crystallinity can be further optimized by adjusting the concentration of PMMA solution.

Fig. 2(b) shows the ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra of the CsPbIBr2 films. They exhibit a similar absorption onset wavelength of ∼590 nm that corresponds to a bandgap of 2.1 eV, consistent with the CsPbIBr2 materials reported earlier.16,20,28,35 The normalized steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the as-studied CsPbIBr2 films are given in Fig. 2(c). A main PL peak at ∼580 nm was detected from each of the CsPbIBr2 films, which is assigned to the band-to-band recombination of photo-generated holes and electrons. In addition, there is a clear shoulder peak at ∼670 nm for the control sample. This shoulder peak can be ascribed to halide segregation, for which the small-bandgap I-rich and large-bandgap Br-rich domains form easily under illumination through the diffusion of halide ions along grain boundaries.23,24,26,27 It is generally accepted that such halide segregation is harmful to the performance and stability of PSCs.24,25 By comparison, the PL shoulder peak weakens significantly for the CsPbIBr2 film obtained with 1 mg mL−1 PMMA solution and disappears entirely for the ones prepared with 3 and 5 mg mL−1 PMMA solution. Namely, the undesired halide segregation can be eliminated by in situ polymer-covered annealing, after optimizing the concentration of PMMA solution.
Carrier dynamics in the studied CsPbIBr2 films are compared by monitoring their PL decays on insulating substrates. The corresponding results are shown in Fig. 2(d), all of which were fitted by a bi-exponential decay function. The time-resolved PL (TRPL) becomes slow with the increase of PMMA concentration. The average decay time (τave) values are determined to be 6.5, 21.3, 30.6, and 41.5 ns for the CsPbIBr2 films prepared with 0, 1, 3, and 5 mg mL−1 PMMA, respectively. A longer τave is usually associated with weaker non-radiative recombination of charge carriers and that primarily results from fewer compositional and structural defects in the CsPbIBr2 film.39,44 Thus, one can infer that the in situ polymer-covered annealing is highly effective for reducing the crystal defects in CsPbIBr2 film, and such a positive effect becomes more obvious when PMMA solution with a higher concentration is adopted.
X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) tests were further performed on the CsPbIBr2 films prepared with 0 and 3 mg mL−1 PMMA, to understand the influences of in situ polymer-covered annealing on the composition of resulting films. Fig. 3(a) gives the XPS survey spectra, wherein the clear signals corresponding to C, Cs, Pb, I, and Br elements can be detected. Fig. 3(b) provides the core-level Cs XPS spectra. Compared with the control sample, the extra C 1s peaks at ∼288.3 eV and ∼285.8 eV can be detected from the CsPbIBr2 film obtained with 3 mg mL−1 PMMA, which correspond to O–CO and C–O functional groups of PMMA, respectively.23 Therefore, we can conclude that there are some residual PMMA species on the surface of CsPbIBr2 film prepared by in situ polymer-covered annealing. In our previous work, we demonstrated that the modification of CsPbIBr2 grains with an appropriate amount of PMMA can significantly suppress halide segregation in CsPbIBr2 film. Based on this fact, we are apt to attribute the eliminated halide segregation of CsPbIBr2 films obtained with 3 and 5 mg mL−1 PMMA to the modification effects of residual PMMA species. Fig. 3(c–f) show the Cs 3d, Pb 4f, I 3d, and Br 3d core-level XPS results of the two films. The binding energies of Pb 4f, I 3d, and Br 3d peaks for the CsPbIBr2 film obtained with 3 mg mL−1 PMMA are larger than those of the control sample, while the binding energies of Cs 3d peaks show the opposite trend. These results indicate the increased electron cloud along with the shielding effect for Pb 4f, I 3d, and Br 3d, while the decreased electron cloud for Cs 3d of the CsPbIBr2 film obtained with 3 mg mL−1 PMMA. Such a phenomenon is primarily associated with the composition difference between the two CsPbIBr2 films.39 Further, the relative amounts of compositional atoms for the related CsPbIBr2 films are evaluated by processing their core-level Cs 3d, Pb 4f, I 3d, and Br 3d XPS spectra with XPSPEAK software and Casa XPS program. The relative atomic ratios of [Pb + Br]/[Cs + I] are calculated to be 1.38 and 1.47 for the CsPbIBr2 films prepared with 0 and 3 mg mL−1 PMMA, which reveals the more stoichiometric composition of CsPbIBr2 film obtained with 3 mg mL−1 PMMA.

Photovoltaic performances of CsPbIBr2 films prepared with different PMMA solution were evaluated, based on a carbon-electrode PSC structure with the simple layer stackings of FTO/TiO2/CsPbIBr2/carbon. As is well known, such a structure is free of noble metal electrode and hole-transporting layer, and thus with no need for any vacuum techniques in its fabrication.14,20,41 Therefore, the final PSCs are endowed with the unique characters of simple fabrication and low cost, thereby having great promise for potential applications. Fig. 4(a) shows a cross-sectional SEM image of one typical carbon-electrode CsPbIBr2 PSC, wherein all the functional layers can be seen clearly. Further, we fabricated 20 CsPbIBr2 PSCs from four independent batches, by use of 0, 1, 3, and 5 mg mL−1 PMMA, respectively. Their PCE statistics are given in Fig. 4(b), for which the average PCEs are assessed to be (8.30 ± 0.30)%, (8.85 ± 0.23)%, (9.84 ± 0.31)%, and (9.09 ± 0.39)% for the CsPbIBr2 PSCs fabricated with 0, 1, 3, and 5 mg mL−1 PMMA, respectively. Clearly, the in situ polymer-covered annealing strategy can realize CsPbIBr2 PSCs with higher PCEs, which can be further optimized by adjusting the concentration of PMMA solution to be 3 mg mL−1. It is noted that the CsPbIBr2 films formed with 3 mg mL−1 PMMA have larger grains, better crystallinity, and weaker non-radiative recombination of charge carriers than the ones prepared with 5 mg mL−1 PMMA. In theory, the corresponding PSCs should yield better performance as well, but the opposite results are observed herein. We attribute such discrepancy to the fact that there are too many residual PMMA species on CsPbIBr2 films formed with 5 mg mL−1 PMMA, which can hinder the transportation of photo-generated holes from CsPbIBr2 to carbon electrode.23,48

(e) Response characteristics to an on/off-modulated 405 nm laser (41 mW cm−2) for a typical CsPbIBr2 PSC prepared with 3 mg mL−1 PMMA. 

Fig. 4(c) presents the current density versus voltage (J–V) curves for the best-performing CsPbIBr2 PSCs produced with 0 and 3 mg mL−1 PMMA. The photovoltaic parameters, including short-circuit current density (Jsc), Voc, fill factor (FF), and PCE, are determined to be 11.50 mA cm−2, 1.221 V, 0.62, and 8.71% for the former one. By comparison, the Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE improve to 11.85 mA cm−2, 1.284 V, 0.69, and 10.50% for the latter one. Moreover, one can see that the higher PCE of CsPbIBr2 PSC fabricated with 3 mg mL−1 PMMA mainly comes from its larger Voc and FF. It should be noted that the PCE achieved herein by the in situ polymer-covered annealing method is better than that of most of the carbon-electrode CsPbIBr2 PSCs reported earlier,14,23,30,36,38–43 as summarized in Table 1. Fig. 4(d) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of as-studied CsPbIBr2 PSCs, from which a similar photocurrent onset of ∼590 nm can be recognized, in line with the bandgap of CsPbIBr2 films. Slightly higher EQEs from 400 to 570 nm can be observed for the CsPbIBr2 PSC fabricated with 3 mg mL−1 PMMA, verifying again its better photovoltaic performance. In addition, the long-term photoresponse property of the CsPbIBr2 PSC prepared with 3 mg mL−1 PMMA to an on/off-modulated 405 nm laser (41 mW cm−2) was recorded in ambient air and at room temperature. As seen from Fig. 4(e), the periodic photoresponse is extremely stable, supporting its excellent operational stability.23,49 Overall, the above characterization results manifest that the CsPbIBr2 PSCs fabricated by in situ polymer-covered annealing exhibit a much higher photovoltaic performance, particularly higher Voc, FF, and PCE, coupled with excellent operational stability.

To further understand the better performance of PSCs fabricated by in situ polymer-covered annealing, the carrier dynamics characteristics of typical PSCs fabricated with 0 and 3 mg mL−1 PMMA were investigated, by use of transient photocurrent/photovoltage (TPC/TPV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Mott–Schottky (M–S) analyses. Fig. 5(a and b) give the corresponding TPC and TPV curves, along with the fitting results. It is obvious that the CsPbIBr2 PSC obtained with 3 mg mL−1 PMMA shows faster TPC and slower TPV, indicating the more effective extraction of charge carriers and the weaker non-radiative recombination of them.14,19,21,38,39Fig. 5(c) shows the Nyquist plots derived from EIS results of the two CsPbIBr2 PSCs, which were tested under a forward bias of 1 V and 0.1 sun illumination. The obvious arc is related to the recombination of charge carriers at the TiO2/CsPbIBr2 interface, characterized by the recombination resistance (Rrec).13–15 One can find that the PSC obtained with 3 mg mL−1 PMMA has a larger Rrec, well confirming the suppressed recombination of charge carriers in it. From the M–S plots in Fig. 5(d), a similar conclusion can be drawn, since the PSC prepared with 3 mg mL−1 PMMA displays a larger built-in potential (Vbi) of 1.33 V than the control sample (1.25 V). The larger Vbi can make for a larger driving electric field for separation, transport and extraction of charge carriers in the PSC.13,21 Overall, it is evident that the higher performance of the optimized PSC produced by in situ polymer-covered annealing can be largely ascribed to the more energetic transporting of charge carriers, and their weaker non-radiative recombination. Originally, these desired characters largely rely on the outstanding properties of the CsPbIBr2 film, including large-sized grains, [110]-preferred orientation, suppressed halide segregation, stoichiometric composition, and reduced non-radiative recombination.

3. Conclusions
The in situ polymer-covered annealing strategy is demonstrated for the first time to modulate the crystal growth of one-step solution-deposited CsPbIBr2 films. The strategy is fulfilled by spin-coating of PMMA solution onto CsPbIBr2 precursor films before annealing. It is revealed that in situ polymer-covered annealing contributes to the formation of CsPbIBr2 films, featuring large-sized grains, [110]-preferred orientation, reduced halide segregation, stoichiometric composition, and decreased non-radiative recombination, all of which are tightly related to the PMMA concentration. These desired features are conducive to boosting the transportation of charge carriers and suppressing their non-radiative recombination in the resulting PSCs. Consequently, with the optimized concentration of 3 mg mL−1, a carbon-electrode PSC with the best PCE of 10.50% is realized, which is much higher than the value of 8.71% of similar PSCs fabricated by conventional annealing. Hence, our work suggests a facile way to improve the performance CsPbIBr2 PSCs and thus promote their potential applications.

Ltd, China. Patterned FTO glass (2 × 2.5 cm2 in size) was obtained from Yingkou OPV Tech New Energy Co. Ltd, China.
Preparation of CsPbIBr2 films
FTO/TiO2 substrates were firstly prepared by spin-coating of TiO2 sol onto pre-cleaned FTO glass and further thermal annealing at 500 °C for 60 min in ambient air. Then, 120 μL of 1 M CsPbIBr2 precursor solution was spin-coated onto each of the FTO/TiO2 substrates at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 3500 rpm for 30 s, successively. The precursor solution was obtained by adding 370 mg PbBr2 and 260 mg CsI into 1 mL DMSO with vigorous stirring. Next, 50 μL of PMMA chlorobenzene solution with a concentration of 1, 3, or 5 mg mL−1 was spin-coated onto the precursor films. Finally, the samples were pre-heated at 60 °C for 2 min and further annealed at 280 °C for 15 min. After cooling down to room temperature naturally, the different CsPbIBr2 films were obtained as fabricated with the in situ polymer-covered annealing strategy. The control sample was prepared by directly pre-heating the CsPbIB2 precursor film at 60 °C for 2 min and further annealing it at 280 °C for 15 min.
Fabrication of carbon-electrode CsPbIBr2 PSCs
A carbon back-electrode with an active area of 0.09 cm2 was screen-printed onto each of the CsPbIBr2 films at room temperature. After being heated at 100 °C in ambient air for 15 min, the as-expected CsPbIBr2 PSCs were obtained.
A detailed description of the characterization methods for the CsPbIBr2 films and the PSCs can be found in our previous works.23,28,38
