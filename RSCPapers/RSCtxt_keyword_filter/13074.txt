    , Accepted 9th February 2022First published on 9th February 2022AbstractThe increasingly popular, lead-free perovskite, Cs3Bi2I9 has a vulnerable Bi3+ state under reductive potentials, due to the high standard reduction potential of Bi3+/Biδ+ (0 < δ < 3). Contrary to this fundamental understanding, herein, ligand-coated Cs3Bi2I9 nanodiscs (NDs) demonstrate outstanding electrochemical stability with up to −1 V versus a saturated calomel electrode in aqueous 0.63 M (5% v/v) and 6.34 M (50% v/v) hydroiodic acid (HI), with a minor BiI3 fraction due to the unavoidable partial aqueous disintegration of the perovskite phase after 8 and 16 h, respectively. A dynamic equilibrium of saturated 0.005 M NDs maintains the common ion effect of I−, and remarkably stabilizes ∼93% Bi3+ in 0.63 M HI under a strong reductive potential. In comparison, the hexagonal phase of bulk Cs3Bi2I9 disintegrates considerably in the semi-aqueous media. Lowering the concentration of synthetic HI from the commonly used ∼50% v/v by elevating the pH from −0.8 to 0.2 helps in reducing the cost per unit of H2 production. Our Cs3Bi2I9 NDs with a hexagonal lattice have 4–6 (002) planes stacked along the c-axis. With 0.005 M photostable NDs, 22.5 μmol h−1 H2 is photochemically obtained within 8 h in a 6.34 M HI solution. Electrocatalytic H2 evolution occurs with a turnover frequency of 11.7 H2 per s at −533 mV and outstanding operational stability for more than 20 h.
Introduction
To alleviate the drawback of traditional HI decomposition at 500 °C in the hydrogen production of a sulphur-iodine cycle,1 photocatalytic splitting of HI has gathered attention as a promising alternative for the generation of hydrogen.2,3 While conventional oxide or chalcogenide semiconductors lose their structural integrity in strongly acidic aqueous HI solutions, the ionic crystals of organo-lead halide perovskites have been found suitable to photochemically split HI into H2 and I3−.4–9 Anchoring a co-catalyst further facilitates the charge separation leading to faster H2 evolution.4–7,9,10 Despite the never-ending spotlight on lead-halide perovskites,11–16 there is growing interest in lead-free perovskite systems. Bismuth-based perovskites have facile synthesis routes and an optimum band gap that offer an edge in low-cost benign solutions to catalyse chemical reactions, which are otherwise difficult to achieve thermodynamically.17,18 The ground state [Xe]4f145d106s26p0 configuration of Bi3+ manifests shallow carrier traps for better electron transfer,19–22 which allows the organic–inorganic perovskites such as the (CH3NH3)Bi2I9,19 PtIx/[(CH3)2NH2]3[BiI6],20 and (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9/DMA3BiI6 heterostructures23 to serve as potential photocatalysts. However, the Bi3+ state is endangered under electrochemical reducing conditions, due to the high standard reduction potentials of 0.2 and 0.31 V for Bi3+/Bi+ and Bi3+/Bi0, respectively, which limit the electrocatalytic potential of the bismuth-halide perovskites.
Cs3Bi2I9 has been used in its micron-sized bulk form for photocatalytic HI splitting,1 as well as for solar cells and photodetectors.24–29 On the contrary, the nano-form of Cs3Bi2I9 has been rarely applied,30 except for in two instances, CO2 reduction and photodetection.31,32 When Cs3Bi2I9 is dispersed in an aqueous HI solution, a high I− concentration is needed for preserving the common ion effect to counteract its decomposition into CsI, BiI and I− according to eqn (1): Cs3Bi2I9 → 3CsI + 2BiI + 4I−(1)
Moreover, in an aqueous HI solution, the bi-octahedral (Bi2I9)3− units in the Cs3Bi2I9 lattice ionize, according to eqn (2):1 (Bi2I9)3− → 2Bi3+ + 9I−(2)
These Bi3+ cations capture the photogenerated electrons, reducing the efficacy of H2 evolution. Therefore, in most cases, ∼50% v/v aqueous HI is used, which is not advantageous considering the limited availability of HI, which requires a separate synthesis.33 Hence the cost per unit of H2 output increases. This is indeed a stumbling block when compared to the ability of II–VI, III–V or I–III–VI semiconductor nanocrystals34,35 to dissociate water photochemically and photoelectrochemically.
The counterintuitive use of Cs3Bi2I9 in less acidic solutions (a lower v/v of HI) is made possible by establishing a dynamic equilibrium between a saturated Cs3Bi2I9 solution and its precipitate.4,19 Here we have tested the stability of the reduction-prone Bi3+ state and hexagonal perovskite phase of 4–6 atomic layer stacked Cs3Bi2I9 NDs in aqueous HI solutions with the calculated pH ranging from −0.8 (6.34 M, 50% v/v HI) to 0.2 (0.63 M, 5% v/v HI). The I− ions from the solution preserve the equilibrium to stabilize the perovskite phase, in particular the Bi3+ state both under illumination and a cathodic bias potential up to −1 V versus a saturated calomel electrode (SCE). After 8 h of exposure to 0.63 M HI or 16 h of exposure to 6.34 M HI, the ligand-coated NDs undergo significantly less moisture-driven breakdown as compared to the bulk Cs3Bi2I9. Only 100 mg (0.005 M) of Cs3Bi2I9 ND catalyst yields 22.5 μmol h−1 H2 within 8 h under visible light irradiation at room temperature from a 6.34 M saturated aqueous HI solution, in the presence of a Pt co-catalyst and using H3PO2 as the I3− scavenger. The flattened discs provide more surface area for the adsorption of the reactant molecules facilitating the charge transfer. The dynamically stabilized NDs can also split aqueous HI electrochemically and remain stable for at least 20 h. With a minimum loading of 0.66 mg cm−2, an overpotential of 533 mV is required at −100 mA cm−2 in the 6.34 M solution. Besides the unusual stabilization of the Bi3+ state under −1 V versus SCE, against the general understanding of Bi3+-containing compounds, these results additionally demonstrate the tremendous advantage of our lead-free perovskite NDs over their bulk counterpart and the reported organic–inorganic Pb-halide perovskite photocatalytic systems for H2 production.
Results and discussion
Cs3Bi2I9 NDs
An orange-red coloured Cs3Bi2I9 ND colloid was prepared by hot injection in which an octadecene (ODE) solution of Cs-oleate was injected into a BiI3 solution at 140 °C, followed by ice quenching within 3s (Fig. 1a). Fig. 1b shows the atomic model of a single ND obtained from a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, assuming a Cs+-terminated surface without considering the ligands. As evident from the powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) pattern in Fig. 1c, the NDs crystallize in a hexagonal structure with the space group P63/mmc according to the COD File No. 2106275.36,37 Since the PXRD measurements were performed on powder samples, diffraction occurs both from the top-face as well as the edges of the randomly oriented NDs. The intense (006) reflection at 2θ = 25.2° conforms to the crystal growth along the c-axis of a hexagonal unit cell, where BiI6 octahedra share faces to create [Bi2I9]3− bi-octahedral clusters.38 The lattice distortions in our ND led to two groups of unequal Bi–I bond lengths from 2.9335(6) to 3.2373(6) Å. The PXRD peaks have an anisotropic broadening, as evident from the nonmonotonic variation of the Full Width at Half Maxima (FWHM) of the peaks as a function of 2θ (Fig. S1†). The TEM image in Fig. 1d shows an ensemble of NDs with a lateral width of 30 to 55 nm. More TEM images are provided in Fig. S2.†

The inset of panel (g) shows the (002) reflection in the low angle PXRD pattern. 
The crystal lattice planes on the ND face are observed in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image in Fig. 1e and are elucidated by the diffraction spots in the fast Fourier transform (FFT) pattern (Fig. 1f). The distinct spots of (100), (200), (203), (205) and (20) appear exclusively on the ND face (ab plane in Fig. 1b), while the (002), (004) and (006) reflections are absent on the ND face. The stacking of the atomic layers can be understood from the vertically aligned NDs where the growth occurs in [001] along the c-axis with an interplanar spacing of 1.1 nm according to the (002) plane (Fig. 1g). The (002) plane correlates with a PXRD reflection at 2θ = 8.1°, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1g. The small angle (002) reflection appears less intense because of its lower resolution in the wide-angle X-ray scattering measurement with a shorter sample-to-detector distance. Due to our short (3s) reaction time after adding the Cs-precursor, the growth of the NDs along the c-axis is arrested by up to a maximum of 4–6 (002) planes stacked together. Atomic force microscopy shows the ND thickness to be 2.1–2.4 nm (Fig. S3a–c†). After 15 and 60 s reaction times, the ND thickness increases to 4.4 and 6.5 nm (Fig. S3d–i†). The elemental stoichiometry of Cs:Bi:I is close to 3:2:9 and was validated by inductively coupled plasma – optical emission spectrometry and high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) mapping and corroborated by the energy dispersive analysis of X-rays (EDAX) from multiple sample locations with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) (Fig. S4†). The ND surface is capped with both oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm) as shown by the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum (Fig. S5a†), and the vibrational modes in the Raman spectrum attest to a well-defined ND lattice (Fig. S5b†). Due to the presence of the residual charges from an excess of unsaturated I− sites at the ND surface even after surfactant capping, the zeta potential measured in the acidic buffer solution is −19.8 mV.
Stabilization of the Cs3Bi2I9 NDs in an aqueous HI solution
Commercially available HI contains 43wt% H2O with a 99.95% purity and this concentration is equivalent to 12.69 M. Herein, the concentration of the aqueous HI solution was maintained at 6.34 M (pH of −0.8) in which different molar concentrations of the Cs3Bi2I9 NDs were added. By keeping the ND concentration ≥0.005 mol L−1, the aqueous solution becomes saturated and the NDs are stabilized in the aqueous HI. Keeping the ND concentration fixed at 0.005 M decreased the HI:H2O ratio in order to study the extent of its aqueous stability. It is remarkable that the ND stability was not compromised, even when the HI concentration was reduced to 0.63 M (5% v/v HI; pH of 0.2) (Fig. 2a). The ND integrity is preserved due to the incessantly established equilibrium between the saturated ND solution and the ND precipitates (Fig. 2b). At a ND concentration ≥0.005 mol L−1, the higher number of Cs+ and (Bi2I9)3− ions in the solution phase regroup to form Cs3Bi2I9 nuclei, which precipitate, maintaining a dynamic equilibrium with the ions in solution. When the ND concentration is lowered to ≤0.004 mol L−1, the solution colour turns a yellowish-orange due to a complete dissolution to form (Bi2I9)3− ions. The observed colour change from a low to high ND concentration in 6.34 M HI, relates to an increase in the visible absorbance as well as the progressively decreasing red shift of the absorption band edge due to agglomeration of the Cs3Bi2I9 nuclei and their subsequent precipitation (Fig. S6†).

The open circles are the experimental data, and the solid line represents the best fit. Sat. denotes the satellite peaks. The two lower-valent sub-peaks in panel (d) are from two unspecified Biδ+ oxidation states. 
The balance between the 0.005 M saturated ND solution and the ND precipitates preserves the dynamic equilibrium between both sides of eqn (1), and prevents the reduction of Bi3+ to Bi+, and the formation of CsI and I−. This equilibrium provides the desired thermodynamic stability for the NDs in all of the solutions from 6.34 M to 0.63 M HI. It is of no surprise that the Bi3+ state is more stable at higher HI concentrations and therefore, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) plots in Fig. 2c show a shift of the Bi3+/Bi+ reduction peak from 0.2 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) to higher reduction potentials as the HI concentration increases from 0.63 M to 12.69 M. The reduction potential increases to 0.37, 0.41, 0.54, 0.60 and 0.68 V in 0.63, 1.26, 3.17, 6.34 and 12.69 M aqueous HI solutions, respectively. The stability results of an all-inorganic ND composition are in direct contrast to CH3NH3PbI3, which is destabilized by aqueous dilution due to its lattice elongation in the presence of water molecules.39,40 While the presence of a deeper valence band edge in heavy elements like Pb increases the tendency of CH3NH3PbI3 to interact with water more easily,41 Cs3Bi2I9 is stabilized by the +3 oxidation state of bismuth with a 6s26p0 ground-state electronic configuration.
To substantiate the stability results, the NDs were subjected to harsher conditions. The high standard reduction potential of Bi3+/Biδ+ (0 < δ < 3) makes it prone to easily reduce to its lower-valent states particularly under the application of a negative electrochemical bias, which is supposed to disintegrate the Cs3Bi2I9 lattice. 0.66 mg cm−2 ND loaded carbon fibre paper (CFP) in 0.005 M saturated ND solutions was exposed to −0.5 and −1 V versus SCE, and the chronoamperometric tests were conducted for 8 and 16 h in 0.63 M and 6.34 M HI solutions, respectively (Fig. S7a†). Contrary to the general belief, X-ray photoelectron spectral (XPS) studies showed that after withstanding −1 V for many hours, 93 and 72 wt% Bi3+ were still retained in the 0.63 M and 6.34 M HI solutions, respectively and the rest reduced to Biδ+ (Fig. 2d and Table S1†). While at −1 V after 16 h, the reduced Biδ+ fractions were 7 and 28 wt% in the 0.63 M and 6.34 M HI solutions, at −0.5 V after 8 h, the values were slightly lower but comparable at 3 and 22 wt%, respectively (Fig. S7b and c†). The comparisons were made based on the deconvoluted 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 levels.
As a devil's advocate, one might argue that the high Bi3+ fraction appears to be a result of the complete reduction of the Bi3+ to Bi0 state at the ND surface under a high reductive bias, i.e. Bi3+ is electrochemically reduced to Bi0 which can undergo an aerial oxidation to an amorphous Bi2O3 surface oxide layer, and the solubilization of Bi2O3 in aqueous HI can form a BiI3 surface layer. This argument implies that the greater the amount of Bi0 (proportional to the reductive potential and time), the greater the amount of BiI3 will be, and the Bi3+ fraction state will be greater after 16 h at −1 V than after 8 h at −0.5 V. However, the comparable Bi3+ wt% in both cases disproves this argument of complete reduction and validates our claim of the partial retention of the perovskite phase, albeit with the coexistence of BiI3 as shown by the PXRD data. Also, according to this argument, due to the absence of surface protecting ligands in bulk Cs3Bi2I9, the surface oxidation to BiI3 and the resulting Bi3+ fraction should have been higher. But under −1 V versus SCE, the bulk phase retains a similar 94 and 81 wt% Bi3+ in 0.63 M and 6.34 M HI after 8 and 16 h, respectively (Fig. S7d and e†). In addition, if the Bi3+ originates only from BiI3 at the ND surface, the concentration of BiI3 and the Bi3+ fraction should have been higher in 6.34 M HI than in 0.63 M HI, which is contrary to our findings. The comparatively less reduction in 0.63 M HI is due to the lower reducing current generated from the poorer ionic conductivity of the diluted aqueous HI solution. These counterarguments provide conclusive evidence that the crystallographic phase of the ligand-coated ND is equipped to sustain itself in a semi-aqueous medium, with low H+ and I− concentrations, particularly under a harsher negative bias.
Simulation of the PXRD patterns shows that upon 8 h and 16 h exposure to semi-aqueous 0.63 M and 6.34 M HI solutions under −1 V versus SCE, the hexagonal structure of the NDs is retained up to 64 and 73 wt%, respectively (Fig. S7f†). The balanced weight fraction is transformed to BiI3, due to exposure of the NDs to the surrounding water molecules, according to eqn (3): (3)
While the majority of the Cs3Bi2I9 lattice is retained because of the ligand coating at the ND surface, the situation is aggravated with bulk Cs3Bi2I9 where only 50 and 57 wt% of the lattice could be retained in 0.63 M and 6.34 M HI solutions under −1 V versus SCE, respectively. The rest transforms to 39 and 41 wt% BiI3 and 11 and 2 wt% BiOI, respectively. In the case of the NDs, although the BiOI phase is not observed in 0.63 M and 6.34 M HI, after 12 h of dispersion in pure DI water (absence of HI), the BiOI phase becomes clearly evident (Fig. S8†). Moreover, the remarkable stability of the NDs in a 0.63 M saturated HI solution can be understood by considering 0.63 M aqueous HI (5% v/v) to be equivalent to 1.1 M pure HI, since the density of HI is 2.85 g ml−1 (Fig. S9†). The saturated solutions contain 0.005 M Cs3Bi2I9 NDs, and therefore the I− concentration of a heavily diluted HI solution is still higher than the ND concentration. Thus, the common ion effect is preserved which does not allow the NDs to disintegrate by the pathway shown in eqn (1).
Photocatalytic HI splitting
The Cs3Bi2I9 NDs show a broad visible light absorption with an inflection at ∼481 nm corresponding to the ground state (n = 1) excitonic transition (Fig. S10a†).42 The NDs show an emission band at 580 nm (Fig. S10b†). The ultraviolet photoelectron spectrum (UPS) elucidates the energy bands where the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are −5.59 and −3.62 eV, respectively with the Fermi level at −4.2 eV (Fig. S10c†). The VBM of the NDs, as determined from the XPS valence band spectrum shows the maximum energy edge at 1.39 eV relative to the Fermi level at −4.2 eV (Fig. S10d†). The VBM of Cs3Bi2I9 has a hybrid character due to the antibonding interactions of I 5p and Bi 6s,38 which lead to an indirect band gap. With respect to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), the VBM and CBM are 1.15 V and −0.82 V,43 respectively which are suitable for the H+/H2 reduction (0.046 V versus NHE) and I−/I3− oxidation (0.376 V versus NHE) (Fig. 3a). An indirect band gap of 1.97 eV is sufficient for the NDs to absorb a major portion of the visible light to generate the excitons followed by a subsequent electron–hole separation and charge transfer.

(d) Recyclability test of the NDs for three 5 h runs in 6.34 M aqueous HI. Evacuation was performed with Ar after each 5 h reaction. (e) PXRD patterns of the Cs3Bi2I9 NDs before and after the 10 h photocatalysis in the 6.34 M and 0.63 M saturated HI solutions. (f) TEM images of the NDs post 10 h photocatalysis in the 6.34 M and 0.63 M saturated HI solutions. 
The photocatalytic measurements were performed in a three-neck round bottom flask under visible-light (λ ≥ 420 nm) irradiation at room temperature (25 °C). The counterpoise between the ND saturation and precipitation is governed by its solubility in the aqueous HI solution, and this solubility increases as expected as the temperature increases (Fig. S11†). In the absence of NDs or in the dark, H2 gas evolution was not observed (Fig. S12†). Under visible light illumination, H2 gas evolution increases as the HI concentration increases (Fig. 3b). The absorption spectra of the aliquots taken at regular time intervals show two bands at 286 and 350 nm (Fig. S13a†), which are characteristic of the I3− ions formed in the reaction media through an ion-induced dipole interaction.44,45 C. B. Allsopp assigned the origin of the twin bands of nearly equal intensity to the generation of both normal and excited iodine atoms in the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 states and suggested an I–I− configuration.45,46
The Beer–Lambert law allows for a quantification of the generated I3− ions (Fig. S13b†), which can then be compared to the amount of H2 gas evolved at the same time interval. Since the 2e− reduction of H+ to H2 is balanced by the 2h+ oxidation of I− to I3−, the H2/I3− ratio should remain as unity, and therefore the I3− ions monitored by absorption spectroscopy complement the H2 gas production. An excellent parity is observed between the evolved H2, as quantified by gas chromatography (GC), and I3− ions, estimated from the absorbance at 350 nm (Fig. 3c). The I3− ions do not originate from the Cs3Bi2I9 lattice, and this has been tested by using HBr instead of HI wherein the 286 and 350 nm absorbance bands are not observed (Fig. S13c†). Only 100 mg (0.005 M) Cs3Bi2I9 ND catalyst yields 11.3 μmol h−1 H2 from the 6.34 M saturated aqueous HI solution within 8 h, with an apparent quantum efficiency of 0.7% (Discussion S1†). The amount of H2 gas evolved in 3.17, 1.26 and 0.63 M HI solutions is 7.7, 5.2, 2.3 and 1.0 μmol h−1 H2, respectively. By considering the molar extinction coefficient of 2.32 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1 from the 350 nm absorbance band, the corresponding amount of I3− is estimated at 7.6, 5.0, 2.2 and 1.0 μmol I3−, in 6.34, 3.17, 1.26 and 0.63 M HI solutions, respectively. The simultaneous generation of I3− turns the solution deep brown in colour which hinders light absorption by the NDs. Electrochemically inactive H3PO2 which is a triiodide ion scavenger, further increases the H2 gas evolution up to 16.2 μmol h−1 in 8 h.4 Upon addition of H3PO2, the solution colour did not change and the photogenerated holes could only oxidize I− without impeding the oxidation of H3PO2. We have also used Pt as a co-catalyst in 6.34 M HI for an efficient extraction of the electrons, which significantly reduces the charge recombination processes. With both H3PO2 and the Pt co-catalyst, the H2 gas evolution nearly doubles to 22.5 μmol h−1 within 8 h, and the quantum efficiency is at 1.3%. Considering the complete utilization of the 0.005 M ND photocatalyst, 225 μmol g−1 h−1 of evolved H2 gas is comparable to the HI-splitting activity of several Pb-based and other Bi-based perovskite systems (Table S2†).1,4–8,10,19,20,23,47–49 However, H2 gas evolution drops slightly to 19.5 μmol h−1 H2 after 10 h of continuous operation.
The outstanding stability of the NDs is further shown by the recyclability tests performed in the 0.63 M and 6.34 M saturated aqueous HI solutions under similar conditions for three 5 h cycles where there was no observable loss in photocatalytic activity (Fig. 3d and Fig. S14†). Even after a continuous run of 10 h (as observed in Fig. 3b), the ND integrity remains unchanged. The hexagonal phase of Cs3Bi2I9 is preserved without any structural breakdown after a 10 h photocatalysis in the 6.34 M and 0.63 M HI solutions (Fig. 3e). The crystalline nanodisc morphology is conserved even in 0.63 M HI (Fig. 3f and Fig. S15†), and the optical response remains uninterrupted and shows the familiar intense excitonic bands (Fig. S16†). Any possible photoinduced segregation of the iodide ions to form iodide-rich domains is also not evident, which is in fact a common phenomenon for organo-lead halide perovskites.50 Post 10 h photocatalysis, the Cs3Bi2I9 lattice volume of 1293.96 Å3 remains unchanged and its chemical states are distinctly retained (Fig. S17†). In pristine NDs, the deconvoluted XPS I 3d level with 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 states at binding energies of 618.33 and 629.86 eV, respectively correlate to a spin orbit splitting of ∼11.5 eV. Similarly, the Bi 4f spectrum is characteristic of Bi3+ species with only spin orbit splitting between the 4f7/2 (159.17 eV) and 4f5/2 (164.47 eV) states of 5.3 eV. Interestingly, there is no observable shift in the binding energies after the photocatalytic stability tests under continuous illumination.
Electrochemical HI splitting
Pertaining to the experimental evidence of the sublime stability of the NDs under a large negative bias, the electrocatalytic activity of the Cs3Bi2I9 NDs was studied at different dilutions of the ND saturated HI solutions. The electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) measurements were conducted in a standard H-cell, where the left and right compartments are separated by a proton exchange membrane, with platinum as the counter electrode and an SCE as the reference (Fig. S18†). Like the chronoamperometry tests, the NDs were drop-casted on the CFP with a loading of 0.66 mg cm−2 inside the saturated 0.005 M ND solutions. The linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) polarization curves recorded in the saturated ND solution in commercially available HI containing 12.69 M (100% v/v) HI demonstrate the lowest overpotential of 485 mV versus RHE at a current density of −100 mA cm−2 (Fig. 4a). By decreasing the HI content, the HER activity decreases due to the gradual decrease of the H+ concentration. The overpotential required for −100 mA cm−2 is 533, 574, 602 and 614 mV in 6.34, 3.17, 1.26 and 0.63 M HI, respectively. For 6.34 M HI at a 533 mV overpotential, the turnover frequency (TOF) is 11.7 H2 per s (Discussion S2†). The abundance of electrochemically active sites provides a high double layer capacitance of 2.4 mF (Fig. S19†). However, at <0.63 M HI, a complete moisture-induced degradation of the ND is observed.

Previous electrochemical experiments with moisture-sensitive organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites could only be performed at high HI concentrations.4 The activities of MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 [MA: CH3NH3, FA: HC(NH2)2] were tested in 6.34 M HI, where the bulk organo-lead halide perovskites show a relatively lower performance than the NDs (Fig. S20†). The overpotential needed to reach −100 mA cm−2 is 714 and 758 mV for MAPbI3 and FAPbI3, respectively, in comparison to the 533 mV for the NDs. The LSV polarization plots in Fig. 4a also show a distinct hump before the onset of H2 evolution due to the reduction of a small fraction of Bi3+ to Biδ+ (0 < δ < 3) within the saturated electrolyte as well as on the drop-cast CFP. Without the NDs on the CFP or in an aqueous HI solution, the current density remains too low, and the overpotential observed in the control experiments with CsI and BiI3 in 6.34 M HI is much higher than that with the Cs3Bi2I9 NDs. These results and the earlier chronoamperometry tests imply that the electrochemical activity of the Cs3Bi2I9 NDs is due to the ND itself and not due to its dissociation into its precursor salts (Fig. S21†). The bulk Cs3Bi2I9 needs a higher overpotential of 552 mV at −100 mA cm−2 with slower charge transfer kinetics than the NDs in 6.34 M HI (Fig. S22†). Fig. 4b shows the plausible mechanistic pathway by which the Cs3Bi2I9 NDs catalyze the electrocatalytic HER process. It involves the activation of Bi3+ into Bi+ ions in the first step under an applied negative bias. Thereafter, the active species containing Bi+ with two vacant sites can bind two H+ leading to the formation of hydrogen in the successive steps. The reappearance of Bi3+ occurs after Bi+ binds two I− from the reaction medium to form the pre-catalyst. This mechanism provides a clue that the primary perovskite composition at the outermost active layer of the NDs remains preserved over long durations under the reductive bias, in accordance with the stability results, which otherwise will temporally limit the electrocatalytic H2 generation. It is only under a stronger reductive bias beyond the potential range shown in Fig. 4a and longer durations that a certain small fraction of the surface Bi3+ can transform to Biδ+ with unpaired 6p electrons (Fig. S7b–e and Table S1†). While the pristine NDs with only the Bi3+ state do not contain any XPS satellite peaks (Fig. S17b†), after exposing them to extreme reductive conditions, the Biδ+ peak area bears a close 1:1 correspondence with the satellite peaks because of the excitation of the unpaired 6p electrons in Biδ+ to a higher energy by the photo-excited core electron. Moreover, a long exposure in the semi-aqueous medium will also transform a part of the surface perovskite composition into BiI3 (Fig. S8†).
The relative HER kinetics can be understood from the Tafel slopes determined from the corresponding LSV polarization curves (Fig. S23a†). The Tafel slopes are relatively low at 44, 52, 80 and 108 mV dec−1 in 6.34, 3.17, 1.26 and 0.63 M saturated HI solutions, respectively, suggesting fast reaction kinetics and the persistence of the NDs at low HI concentrations. The Nyquist plots fitted with the simplified Randles circuit in Fig. S23b† reveal a charge transfer resistance of 2.5, 7.6, 12.3 and 20.4Ω in 6.34, 3.17, 1.26 and 0.63 M HI solutions, respectively. The faradaic efficiency of 78.5% is determined by eudiometry at a constant overpotential of 1 V (iR uncorrected) in the 6.34 M HI solution (Fig. S23c†). Although a decent faradaic efficiency indicates adequate power conversion efficiency from electrical to chemical energy,51 a value of 78.5% is due to the side reaction of the Bi3+ to Biδ+ reduction.
Chronoamperometry measurements were also performed beyond the time duration used for the PXRD and XPS characterizations (Fig. S7†), and here too the NDs are found to remain stable for ≥20 h, at HI concentrations higher than 0.63 M (Fig. 4c). In 0.63 M HI, the ND catalyst is stable for 10 h, beyond which there is an intrusion of water molecules. The HI solution changes its colour progressively under the cathodic bias, shown up to 3 h (Fig. S18 ii–iv†). Since a proton exchange Nafion membrane is kept between the anodic and cathodic sections of the H-cell, the I3− ions originally present in the cathodic section (right side) are electrochemically reduced to I− continuously with time, and the HI solution color is thus altered from dark brown to a light yellowish orange. The electrocatalytic activity is improved considerably after the test due to breeding a greater number of active sites on the ND surface under a cathodic bias (Fig. 4c insets). This is a common occurrence for inorganic HER catalysts when Pt is used as the counter electrode.51
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the efficacy of 4–6 atomic layer stacked, 30–55 nm wide Cs3Bi2I9 NDs to stabilize the Bi3+ state under the extreme condition of −1 V versus SCE, or illumination for the purpose of H2 generation from an aqueous 5% diluted HI solution. The stabilization of the Bi3+ state under a strong cathodic bias potential is against the general understanding of the instability of Bi3+-containing compounds under reducing conditions due to the high standard reduction potential of Bi3+/Biδ+ (0 < δ < 3). This outstanding result for the stabilization of ∼93% of the Bi3+ state under a strong cathodic bias potential at pH 0.2 (5% HI) is maintained by the dynamic equilibrium set between the saturated 0.005 M ND aqueous HI solution and ND precipitates. However, after 8 h and 16 h exposure to 0.63 M and 6.34 M HI solutions under −1 V versus SCE, 64 and 73 wt% of the ND hexagonal structure are retained, respectively, and the rest transforms to BiI3. For bulk Cs3Bi2I9, only 50 and 57 wt% of the lattice could be retained, respectively after the partial disintegration to BiI3 and BiOI. Our approach to lower the HI concentration (by elevating the pH of the HI solution from −0.8 to 0.2) is in order to reduce the cost per unit of H2 production. On the other hand, by saturating the 6.34 M aqueous HI solution with 0.005 M NDs in the presence of H3PO2 and the Pt co-catalyst, photocatalytic HI splitting delivers 22.5 μmol h−1 H2 within 8 h under visible light irradiation at room temperature, in the absence of any electron or hole-transporting additives. Even when the solution becomes more aqueous with only 5% v/v HI, the NDs remain stable for a minimum of 10 h of continuous photocatalysis. Additionally, a minimum ND loading of 0.66 mg cm−2 is found capable to drive the electrocatalytic HI splitting, needing a 533 mV overpotential at −100 mA cm−2 in a 6.34 M saturated solution. Except for the 10 h stability in 0.63 M HI, the NDs remain stable for more than 20 h at lower pH, with the retention of a majority of the Bi3+ state and perovskite lattice under a cathodic bias, in all cases.

Synthesis of Cs-oleate
0.41 mmol Cs2CO3 (134 mg), 5 ml ODE and 0.5 ml OA were mixed in a 50 ml three-necked round bottom flask and stirred under vacuum for 30 min. The mixture was heated at 120 °C for another 30 min followed by N2 purging until a clear solution was obtained. The solution was kept at this temperature for further use.
Synthesis of the Cs3Bi2I9 NDs
A mixture of 0.4 mmol BiI3 (236 mg), 0.5 ml OAm, 0.5 ml OA and 5 ml ODE was stirred under vacuum at 120 °C for 30 min and then at 140 °C for another 30 min followed by N2 purging until the solution became clear. 1.2 ml of Cs-oleate was added to the solution, and after 3s, the reaction mixture was quenched in an ice-water bath. The ND solution was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 10 min, whereby the supernatant was discarded and the precipitate was dissolved in hexane. The precipitate was again centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 10 min and the final precipitate was dried under vacuum.
Synthesis of bulk Cs3Bi2I9
0.09 mmol (23.4 mg) CsI and 0.06 mmol (35.4 mg) BiI3 were dissolved in 2 mL DMSO to form a precursor solution, 200 μL of which was injected into 5 mL isopropanol under vigorous stirring. The resultant red colloidal solution was centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 10 min and dried under vacuum.
Characterization and measurements
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were performed with a Rigaku powder X-ray diffractometer having a Cu Kα = 1.54059 Å radiation. The quantitative estimation of the phases was obtained by Rietveld refinement of the PXRD patterns using GSAS-II software where the fitting was done with the minimum weighted residual. The three-dimensional visualization of the crystal structures was obtained by Vesta software from the refined cif files. Post chronoamperometry (CA), PXRD patterns were recorded on the NDs loaded on the 0.5 × 0.6 cm2 CFP substrates. The three-dimensional visualization of the ND structure was obtained by Vesta software using the PXRD generated cif file. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images and HAADF-STEM mapping were obtained with a DST-FIST facility, IISER Kolkata, JEOL, JEM-2100F. Field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) images were recorded using a Carl Zeiss SUPRA 55VP FESEM. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) spectra were obtained by Oxford Instruments X-Max with INCA software coupled to the FESEM. XPS measurements were performed by mounting the samples on copper stubs with a silver paste in a commercial photoelectron spectrometer PHI 5000 Versa Probe II, FEI Inc, IIT Kanpur using Al Kα (1486.6 eV) as the excitation source. The acquired data were background-corrected by the Shirley method, and the peaks were fitted using Fityk software, with the Voigt peaks having 80% Gaussian and 20% Lorentzian components to evaluate the valence states. All of the data were corrected with respect to the C 1s spectra. The zeta potential was measured by a Malvern Panalytical Zetasizer Ver. 7.13 Serial Number: MAL1211730. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectral measurements were performed using a PerkinElmer spectrum RX1 with KBr pellets. Raman spectra were recorded with a 532 nm line of a He–Ne ion laser as the excitation source (LABRAM HR800). The UV-visible absorption spectra were measured using a Jasco V-670 spectrophotometer and the PL spectra were measured by Horiba Job in Yvon Fluorolog using an Xe lamp at the excitation wavelength of 400 nm.
ND saturated aqueous HI solution and solubility measurements
50 mg Cs3Bi2I9 NDs was added to 2 ml of a 6.34 M aqueous HI solution. The ND saturated solution was sonicated and stirred for 30 min at different temperatures to reach an equipoise between the ND precipitates and the saturated solution. 100 μl of the supernatant solution was drop cast on a clean silicate glass substrate from each solution and heat treated at 120 °C for 20 min for solvent evaporation. The ND solute weight was determined from the mass difference between the weight before and after solution dropping. Using the ND solute weight, the solubility was calculated at different temperatures, by eqn (S1):† (4)where xi is the mole fraction, ΔmHi is the enthalpy of melting, Tf is the final temperature and Ti is the initial temperature of the solute at saturation.
Photocatalytic measurements
The photocatalytic measurements were carried out using a steady-state AM 1.5G Solar Simulator Class AAA Model: PEC-L01 (Batsol). An Xe lamp (Newport Instruments, 450 W) served as the light source with a 150 mW cm−2 calibrated light intensity and online gas chromatograph (Trace 1110, Thermo Scientific instrument, IACS Kolkata) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID) in series was used to analyse the obtained gaseous products. The amount of H2 was detected at each 1 h interval. 10 ml of different concentrations of the aqueous HI solution was mixed with 100 mg of the Cs3Bi2I9 NDs followed by purging with Ar gas and stirring for 1 h in the dark to obtain a perfect saturation. A negligible change in the temperature of 0.5 °C before and after light irradiation was detected. For the validation of the photocatalytic mechanism with H3PO2 as the I3− scavenger, the HI solution and H3PO2 were mixed in a 4:1 volume ratio. For the experiments with Pt as the co-catalyst, 3 mg H2PtCl6·6H2O was mixed with a 6.34 M HI solution. For the recyclability tests, each measurement was conducted after keeping the solution in the dark for 1 h and purging with Ar gas for 30 min. To estimate the generated I3− by spectrophotometry, 10 μl aliquots were taken out at different time intervals and diluted to 3 ml with DI water. The diluted solutions were analysed by a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer where the absorbance at 350 nm was compared to a standard curve of I3− to calculate the amount of I3− generated in the solutions.
Electrochemical measurements
All of the electrochemical experiments were performed in a BioLogic VSP-300 electrochemical work station using an H-cell to separate the anode and cathode compartments with a proton exchange Nafion membrane spacer. A three-electrode system was used for evaluating the HER activity where the Pt wire was used as the counter electrode, an SCE was used as the reference electrode and the perovskite NDs drop cast on the CFP were used as the working electrode. For conducting the electrocatalytic measurements, DI water was added to a commercial HI solution in different amounts to make 12.69, 6.34, 3.17, 1.26 and 0.63 M aqueous HI solutions followed by Ar purging for 20 min in both of the compartments. A required amount of the NDs was successively added to each of the HI solutions to prepare a 0.005 M saturated HI solution to maintain the dynamic equilibrium. 15 ml of the different concentrations of the aqueous HI solution was maintained at each compartment. 5 mg of the Cs3Bi2I9 ND catalyst was dispersed in 0.5 ml HI (balance 57 wt% water) followed by sonication for 10 min. 20 μL of catalyst ink was drop cast in a 0.5 × 0.6 cm2 area of the CFP followed by drying at 60 °C in an oven for 2 h to obtain the final catalyst loading of 0.66 mg cm−2. All of the working electrodes were saturated by bulk electrolysis at a high voltage (iR uncorrected, 1 V overpotential for HER) for a few seconds, followed by 30 CV scans at a scan rate of 100mVs−1. To avoid the effect of a capacitive current, LSV measurements were performed at a scan rate of 1 mV s−1. The Tafel plots were obtained from the LSV plots. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed in the frequency range of 1 MHz to 10 mHz at a constant overpotential of 700 mV (iR uncorrected). Moreover, all of the measured potentials are iR-corrected (unless specified) to nullify the effect of solution resistance by eqn (S2):† (5)where ERHE and ESCE are the potentials at the working electrode with respect to the RHE and SCE, respectively and  is the standard potential of the SCE (0.241 V). To reuse the oxidised HI solution, CA was performed at a constant overpotential of −1 V versus SCE for 6 h. With increasing time, the colour of the electrolyte in the cathode side changed from dark brown to a light yellow indicating the reduction of I3− to I−. The faradaic efficiency of the catalyst was calculated by the eudiometric method at a constant overpotential of 1 V (iR uncorrected) in a 6.34 M HI solution. Double layer capacitance (Cdl) was obtained by conducting cyclic voltammogram (CV) cycles at different scan rates i.e. 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 mVs−1 in the non-faradaic potential range (−0.01 to 0.01 V vs. SCE). The electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) was determined by dividing the Cdl value by the specific capacitance (Cs = 0.04 mF cm−2). The CA stability tests were performed at −0.5 and −1 V versus SCE on the CFP loaded with NDs or bulk Cs3Bi2I9.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic showing the synthesis of the Cs3Bi2I9 NDs. (b) Atomic model of a single ND, considering the A-site (Cs+) cations on the surface without the capping ligands. (c) PXRD pattern of the NDs and the inset shows the hexagonal unit cell, obtained by Rietveld analysis of the PXRD pattern. (d) TEM image of the Cs3Bi2I9 NDs. (e) HRTEM image of the ND face and (f) FFT pattern from the area marked in panel (e). (g) TEM image of the vertically aligned NDs showing the stacking of the 4–6 (002) planes along the c-axis. The inset of panel (g) shows the (002) reflection in the low angle PXRD pattern.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) PXRD patterns of the Cs3Bi2I9 ND precipitates in different concentrations of aqueous HI solutions. (b) Digital images of the Cs3Bi2I9 ND saturated in the 6.34 M aqueous HI solutions demonstrating the change in solution color with ND molar concentrations. (c) CV plots showing the shift in the Bi3+/Bi+ reduction potential of the NDs from 0.63 M to 12.69 M aqueous HI concentrations. Fitted XPS Bi 4f level after subjecting the NDs to −1 V versus SCE in (d) 6.34 M HI for 16 h and (e) 0.63 M HI for 8 h. The open circles are the experimental data, and the solid line represents the best fit. Sat. denotes the satellite peaks. The two lower-valent sub-peaks in panel (d) are from two unspecified Biδ+ oxidation states.

 	Fig. 3  (a) Schematic representation of the charge transfer mechanism for photocatalytic HI splitting. (b) Photocatalytic H2 gas evolution in different concentrations of aqueous HI solutions with 0.005 M NDs under excitation by a 150 W Xe lamp (λ ≥ 420 nm). (c) Bar plots showing the quantitative comparison between the evolved H2 gas and I3− ions generated in the solution after 1 h of photocatalysis. (d) Recyclability test of the NDs for three 5 h runs in 6.34 M aqueous HI. Evacuation was performed with Ar after each 5 h reaction. (e) PXRD patterns of the Cs3Bi2I9 NDs before and after the 10 h photocatalysis in the 6.34 M and 0.63 M saturated HI solutions. (f) TEM images of the NDs post 10 h photocatalysis in the 6.34 M and 0.63 M saturated HI solutions.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) LSV polarization plots for the electrochemical HER with an ND mass loading of 0.66 mg cm−2 on the CFP inside the 0.005 M ND saturated aqueous HI solution. (b) Proposed mechanism of electrocatalytic HI splitting. (c) Chronoamperometric stability of HI splitting by the Cs3Bi2I9 NDs at −1 V versus SCE. Insets show the LSV curves before and after the durability test (J: current density).
