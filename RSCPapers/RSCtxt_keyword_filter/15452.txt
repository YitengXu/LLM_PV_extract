However, it is rarely used in quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). Here, glucose-derived porous carbon was obtained by hydrothermal carbonization followed with high-temperature KOH activation, and employed as an efficient counter electrode (CE) for QDSCs. The CV, EIS and Tafel-polarization analysis showed that porous carbon exhibits excellent catalytic activity for reduction of Sn2−. The CE based on porous carbon activated at 900 °C (C900) presents best performance with interface charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 2.4 Ω cm2 due to the synergy between high graphitization degree and large specific surface area. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the QDSCs assembled with a CdS/CdSe sensitized TiO2 photoanode and the C900 CE is up to 5.61% under one sun illumination. The excellent catalytic activity of C900 is attributed to its large specific surface area and porous structure and high degree graphitization. This suggests that glucose-derived porous carbon can become a potential low-cost and efficient CE material for QDSCs.
1. Introduction
Over the past few decades, people have been working to develop environmentally friendly, low-cost and highly efficient solar cells to cope with growing energy demand and environmental pollution.1,2 So far, the mature silicon-based solar cells (first-generation solar cells) and thin film solar cells (second-generation solar cells) have already been commercialized.2 However, due to the high cost, the first two generations of solar cells have not been widely used. In order to realize the low-cost utilization of solar energy at an early date, people have pinned their hopes on third-generation solar cells, such as dye-sensitized solar cells, organic photovoltaics, perovskite solar cells and QDSCs etc.3–10 Among these solar cells, QDSCs attract an increasing number of researchers' attention owing to their low cost, large absorption coefficient, multi-exciton effect and theoretical PCE of up to 44%.7–10 Thanks to the efforts of many researchers, the PCE of QDSCs has been continuously improved,11–16 and the highest PCE reached 13.75%,16 which allows it to compete with other third-generation solar cells. The typical liquid-bonded QDSCs consist of a quantum dot (QD) sensitized photoanode composed of a mesoporous TiO2 (or ZnO) film supported on a conductive glass (FTO), an electrolyte containing a S2−/Sn2− redox couples and a CE (composition consisting of a catalyst supported on a conductive substrate).17 The effect of CEs on the performance of QDSCs is mainly due to its electrical conductivity (including the conductivity of conductive substrates and catalysts) and the electrocatalytic activity for reduction of Sn2−.
The energy loss caused by electronic transfer resistance (Rct) between CEs and electrolyte has a significant effect on the fill factor (FF) and short-circuit current (J0) of QDSCs, and ultimately affects the PCE.18,19 In recent years, more people pay attention to the development of counter electrodes. Due to excessive potential and the “poisoning” effect of the strong chemisorption of sulfur ions, Pt CEs with excellent performance in DSSCs exhibits poor catalytic activity in QDSCs.20 Therefore transition metal chalcogenides (such as Cu2S, NiS, CoS2, FeS, PbS, Cu2−xSe, etc.) have been developed as effective alternatives to Pt.20–26 However, it is well known that sulfides are easily detached from the counter electrodes into the electrolyte, and then adsorbed on the surface of the photoanode, thereby poisoning the photoanode and reducing the stability of the QDSCs. Additionally, the high price of metal is not conducive to further reducing the cost of QDSCs. In recent years, carbon materials are expected to be effective materials of CEs for QDSCs owing to the good conductivity, low cost, large specific surface area, good stability and abundant sources.27–31 And a wealth of research results have been obtained by various carbon materials (including carbon nanotubes, carbon black, graphene and activated carbon, etc.) as CEs for QDSCs.27–31 For example, Chandu V. V. M. Gopi et al. used carbon nanotubes instead of CuS as the counter electrode of QDSCs, and achieved a PCE of 4.67%, while CuS CE-based PCE is only 3.67%.28 Hua Zhang et al. used graphene hydrogel as the CE, and the assembled CdSeTe QDSCs achieved an efficiency of 9.85%.29 The nitrogen-doped porous carbon CEs prepared through hard template method by Shuang Jiao et al., and then combined with a Zn–Cu–In–Se QD-sensitized photoanode achieved a record-breaking efficiency of 12.45%.32 Although the research on carbon materials has made great progress, the above-mentioned carbon materials still have shortcomings such as lack of raw materials and high cost, so it is still worth exploring to develop cheaper and more efficient carbon materials.
In recent years, biomass-derived porous carbon has been widely used in lithium batteries, supercapacitors and carbon dioxide capture technologies due to its abundant raw material sources, large specific surface area, good stability and low cost,33–35 and achieved very excellent research results. In view of these characteristics of biomass-derived porous carbon, it is reasonable to believe that biomass-based porous carbon can exhibit excellent performance in QDSCs and effectively reduce its manufacturing cost. But unfortunately, in QDSCs, biomass-derived porous carbon has not received much attention, and there are rarely reports. To the best of our knowledge, except that Sahasrabudhe et al. used hair-derived porous carbon as the counter electrode of QDSCs and achieved the power conversion efficiency of 4.44%,36 there is no any further application of biomass-based porous carbon in QDSCs. Glucose is a typical biomass with abundant sources and low cost, and is one of the ideal materials for the synthesis of porous carbon.35,37–39
Herein, the glucose was carbonized by a simple hydrothermal method and activated it with KOH under Ar stream at 900 °C for 1 h to obtain a porous carbon with large specific surface area. Chemical activation is a predominant process to obtain large surface area and porous structure, especially, pyrolysis temperature plays a key role in obtaining large specific surface area samples. Increasing the activation temperature will increase the degree of graphitization of porous carbon, which is beneficial to the electrocatalytic process. However, if the temperature is too high, the pore wall may partly be burnt, resulting in a reduction in the specific surface area of the porous carbon. In this study, we achieved the balance between graphitization and large specific surface area at 900 °C, so that the prepared porous carbon material possess good electrocatalytic activity for Sn2− reduction. The counter electrode based on porous carbon was used in CdS/CdSe QDSCs, and a PCE of 5.61% was obtained.
2. Experiment
2.1 Synthesis of porous carbon
5 g of D-glucose was dissolved in 80 ml of deionized water and then hydrothermally reacted in a stainless steel autoclave lined with Teflon. A 12 h hydrothermal process was carried out at 180 °C. The brown product was washed five times with deionized water, and then dried for 12 h at 80 °C. The 2 g of hydrothermal carbon was blended with 4 g of KOH in an aqueous solution. The sample was then dried at 120 °C for 12 h. The mixture was sintered under a nitrogen stream at a temperature of 600 °C, 700 °C, 800 °C and 900 °C for 1 h, respectively, and the heating rate was controlled at 10 °C min−1. The obtained samples were designated as C600, C700, C800, and C900, respectively. After natural cooling, the obtained porous carbon was washed with deionized water to pH neutrality, and dried under vacuum at 60 °C overnight.
2.2 Preparation of CEs
20 mg of porous carbon and 100 μL of a binder solution (prepared by mixing 8.0 mL of terpineol with 0.2 g of ethyl cellulose and 0.5 mL of titanium isopropoxide and sonicating for 10 min) and grind into a carbon paste. Carbon paste was scraped onto a titanium mesh (thickness controlled to 200 μm) and heated in argon at 500 °C for 1 h.
2.3 Preparation of photoanodes
The transparent layer paste and the scattering layer paste were prepared according to the literature method, and some modifications were made to improve the performance photoanodes.17 Terpineol, ethyl cellulose and P25 were mixed at a mass ratio of 16:1:1, and ultrasonic dispersed for 30 minutes using an ultrasonic cell pulverizer to obtain a transparent layer paste. The preparation method of the scattering layer paste is the same as that of the transparent layer paste, except that 300 nm titanium dioxide particles are used instead of 40% of P25. Typically, a solution of about 0.1 M of titanium isopropoxide in isopropanol was used as a precursor, and spin-coated on the FTO at 50 rpm s−1, after which titanium isopropoxide would hydrolyzed into a dense layer of titanium dioxide. Four transparent layers and two scattering layers were obtained by spin coating at 2500 rpm min−1, and dried at 120 °C on a hot plate and cooled naturally. Finally, the TiO2 photoanode films was heated at 500 °C for half an hour.
A ZnS layer was first coated on the TiO2 film by the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR). Four SILAR cycles of ZnS deposition were carried out using a 0.1 M Zn(AC)2·2H2O methanol solution and 0.1 M Na2S·9H2O solution (deionized water and methanol as solvent, 1:1, v/v). SILAR and chemical bath deposition (CBD) methods were used to deposit CdS and CdSe QDs in TiO2 film, respectively.23 Firstly, the TiO2 photoanode was immersed in a 0.1 M Cd(CH3COO)2 methanol solution for 2 minutes, which caused Cd2+ to adsorb on TiO2. The TiO2 photoanode were then immersed in deionized water for 1 minute to remove excess Cd2+ and dried at 80 °C. Next, the dried electrode was immersed in 0.1 M Na2S·9H2O solution (deionized water and methanol as solvent, 1:1, v/v) for 2 minutes, where the Cd2+ would react with the S2− to form CdS QDs. The as-prepared electrode was then soaked in deionized water for 1 minute and again dried with a hot plate at 80 °C. This process is called a SILAR cycle and was carried out for 5 cycles to obtain the appropriate CdS QDs. Then, CdSe QDs was loaded on TiO2 by the CBD. The precursor solution was then prepared by mixing 0.1 M CdSO4 aqueous solution, 0.2 M N(CH2COONa)3 aqueous solution and 0.1 M Na2SeSO3 aqueous solution (1:1:1, v/v). The TiO2 electrode was immersed in the precursor solution for 5 h at 50 °C to form CdSe QDs. At last, a ZnS passivation layer was deposited on CdS/CdSe QDs-TiO2 electrode with 6 SILAR cycles.
2.4 Assembly of QDSCs
QDSCs were assembled by sandwiching CdS/CdSe QD-TiO2 electrodes, porous carbon CEs filled with polysulfide electrolyte (2.0 M S, 2.0 M Na2S and 0.2 M KCl aqueous solution). The effective area of a cell is 0.25 cm2.
2.5 Testing
The morphology of porous carbon was characterized with a transmission electron microscope. The Raman spectrum of porous carbon was characterized with a Raman microscope (Sierra IM-52, Snowy Range Instruments, 785 nm). The crystal information of porous carbon was characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD; Bruker AXS GmbH, D8 ADVANCE, CuKα radiation). The specific surface area was measured with a N2 adsorption–desorption technique (Micromeritics ASAP 2460). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (0.1 V deviation, frequency from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz), cyclic voltammetry and Tafel polarization analysis (scanning rate 50 mV s−1, edge potential from −0.8 V to 0.8 V) were tested with an electrochemical workstation. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of QDSCs were measured with a HGILX500 technology solar simulator under one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2), scanning from −0.7 V to 0 V at the 0.1 V s−1 of scan rate. The light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cells before a test.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphological and structural characterizations
The X-ray diffraction pattern of porous carbon derived from glucose is shown in Fig. 1. The porous carbon at different activation temperatures has almost the same XRD pattern, and the two peaks of the XRD pattern at the 2θ values of 24.23° and 43.45° correspond to the (0 0 2) and (1 0 1) planes of carbon, respectively.
 Fig. 1  XRD spectra for porous carbon. 

Fig. 2 shows the Raman spectra of porous carbon. A distinct band is observed around 1349 cm−1, which is D band, a sign of the formation of disordered structures (defects, bond cleavage and vacancies).40 Another obvious band observed around 1609 cm−1 is G band, which is a common feature of the graphite structure caused by the vibration mode of the sp2 bonded carbon atoms in the plane.40 The degree of disorder in the graphite structure can be estimated the ratio of ID/IG. The low ID/IG ratio indicates a high degree of order, closer to the graphite structure, which is beneficial to enhance the conductivity and electrochemical activity of material.41 The ID/IG ratios of different porous carbon are listed in Table 1, it increases with activated temperature raising from 600 °C to 700 °C, and decreases from 700 °C to 900 °C. It had been reported that the activation process of KOH leads to disordered structures such as defects in carbon material, while high temperatures promote the graphitization of carbon materials.42 The ID/IG ratio of porous carbon at different activated temperatures is a result of the combined action of temperature with potassium hydroxide.

The elemental composition of porous carbon C900 was analyzed by XPS. As shown in Fig. 3(a), two peaks at 284.7 and 532 eV of sample C900 are attributed to the C 1s and O 1s peaks, respectively, which prove the existence of the C and O elements. In Fig. 3(b), it can be seen that the C 1s peak was fitted into three peaks of sp2 C (284.68 eV), sp3 C (285.44 eV), and C–O (286.97 eV), and corresponding carbon content are 70%, 19% and 11%, respectively. The high sp2 C content in sample C900 indicates it has high orderliness and good electrical conductivity, which is beneficial to improving its electrocatalytic activity for reduction of Sn2−.

In order to further observe the morphology of porous carbon, SEM and TEM images of C900 are shown in Fig. 4(a–h). It can be seen that the sample exhibits a three-dimensional porous structure and rich macropores with a size between 100 nm and 500 nm. The pore walls exhibit a honeycomb structure and are covered with many mesopores and micropores. This multi-level pore structure of porous carbon not only provides a large number of catalytically active sites, but also facilitates the transport of polysulfide electrolyte.

The specific surface area and pore size distribution of samples were estimated by measuring the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm. As shown in Fig. 5(a), according to the IUPAC classification, the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of four samples show a typical type IV isotherm. Specifically, the sharp rise of the isotherms at P/P0 < 0.001 shows that the samples have a large number of microporous structures, while the H4 hysteresis loop at 0.4 < P/P0 < 1 indicates that there is a large amount of mesoporous structure.43 At the same time, the pore size distribution plots (Fig. 5(b)) also confirm the presence of abundant microporous and mesoporous structures in the samples. The rich pore structure provides a large specific surface area for the porous carbon samples, and corresponding data is showed in Table 2. The specific surface area of the sample is raised from 450 m2 g−1 to 1215 m2 g−1 as the temperature is raised from 600 °C to 800 °C, and then, decreased to 889 m2 g−1 when the temperature continues to increase to 900 °C. The large specific surface area and rich pore structure of porous carbon make it possible for porous carbon to have excellent electrocatalytic activity for polysulfide electrolyte.

3.2 Electrochemical characterization
To test the electrochemical activity of porous carbon electrodes, an EIS was measured using a symmetrical dummy cell composed of two identical porous carbon electrodes. As shown in Fig. 6(a), the intercept on the real axis represents the sheet resistance (Rs), which is mainly determined by the conductivity of the titanium mesh substrate and the porous carbon. The first semicircle in the high frequency region (100k–1 Hz) reflects the charge transfer impedance (Rct) at the interface of CE/electrolyte, which is closely related to the catalytic activity of the counter electrodes in reducing the polysulfide electrolyte. The oblique line in the low frequency range (1–0.1 Hz) represents to the Nernst diffusion resistance (ZN) within the electrolyte. The EIS data is fitted by the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 6(a), the relevant parameters are given in Table 3. The Rct value of the porous carbon CE decreases as the temperature increases, indicating that an increase in temperature is beneficial to improve the electrocatalytic activity. When the activated temperature is raised from 600 °C to 800 °C, the increase in catalytic activity is attributable to the increase in specific surface area, while as the temperature continues to rise to 900 °C, the specific surface area decrease, but the catalytic activity is still slightly improved. There seems to be a contradiction. However, according to the report of Sahasrabudhe et al.,36 the specific surface area is not the only determinant, and the degree of graphitization of carbon material is also one of the important factors affecting the electrocatalytic activity. According to the Raman spectroscopy described above, when the activated temperature is raised from 800 °C to 900 °C, the degree of graphitization of the porous carbon is increased, the conductivity of the porous carbon is enhanced, and then the electrocatalytic activity is increased. The overall result is a slight increase in the electrocatalytic activity of the porous carbon material. The excessive temperature makes the carbon sublimate and the yield is extremely low, so 900 °C is the best activation temperature.

To confirm the catalytic activity of these electrodes, Tafel polarization analysis was performed for the symmetrical cells used in the EIS, as shown in Fig. 6(b). This test was used to examine the interfacial charge transfer properties of the S2−/Sn2− redox couple on the symmetrical cells configuration using different CEs. The exchange current density (J0) can be obtained by using the extrapolated linear region of the anode and cathode branches, which is usually used to evaluate the electrochemical activity of CEs. It can be seen that C900 CE has the highest J0 value, which is in good agreement with the EIS results, further indicating that the C900 CE has the best catalytic activity.
In order to evaluate the catalytic activity of electrodes, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out with a three-electrode system in an aqueous solution of 0.2 M KCl, 0.05 M Na2S, and 0.05 M S at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. Pt and Ag/AgCl electrode are counter and reference electrode, respectively. Fig. 6(c) shows the cyclic voltammetry results of porous carbon CEs. Two pairs of peaks can be observed for the CV curves of CEs. As shown in CV curves, the anodic peaks (positive region) are related to the oxidation reaction of sulfide ions, while the cathodic peaks (negative region) can be attributed to the reduction reaction of polysulfide ions. The cathode peak intensity are commonly used to evaluate the electrochemical activity. The Fig. 6(c) show that C900 CE has the highest cathode current density, indicating that C900 CE has the strongest electrochemical activity. In addition, a multi-cycle successive CV scanning (at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1) was performed to evaluate the stability of CE materials in the polysulfide electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 6(d), C900 CE maintained almost the same CV curves after 50 cycles of continuous scanning, implying excellent electrochemical stability of porous carbon in the polysulfide electrolyte system.
The J–V curve is an important basis for evaluation CEs and the overall performance of QDSSCs. The cell were assembled by CdS/CdSe sensitized TiO2 photoanodes and various porous carbon CEs, and illuminated under one sunlight to test the J–V curves, the results is shown in Fig. 7, and corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 3. Obviously, with the activation temperature increases, the PCE continues to increase. The QDSCs with C900 CE exhibits the highest Jsc, Voc and FF, and the PCE reaches 5.61%. The PCE with C600 CE is a minimum value of 3.99%. Due to the same other structure of cells, the high of PCE is attributed to the higher catalytic activity of the porous carbon CE prepared at higher activated temperature. Table 4 summarizes the photovoltaic parameters of QDSCs based the same CdS/CdSe QDs and polysulfide electrolyte as this work in recent years. The PCE of QDSC with C900 CE achieves the higher value in this work.

4. Conclusion
In summary, porous carbon material was successfully prepared by hydrothermal carbonization followed with KOH activation, and used as CEs for QDSCs. The study shows that a balance exists between graphitization degree and specific surface area of carbon material under high activated temperature. The CE based on porous carbon activated at 900 °C (C900) presents best performance, and the CdS/CdSe QDSCs with the C900 CE yielded a PCE up to 5.61%. This suggests that glucose-derived porous carbon material can be a potential low-cost and efficient CE material for QDSCs.
