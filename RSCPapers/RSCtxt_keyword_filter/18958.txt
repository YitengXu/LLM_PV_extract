    , Accepted 18th June 2021First published on 18th June 2021AbstractTwo analogue molecules, BDTP-2F with difluorobenzene π-bridges and BDTP-4F with tetrafluorobenzene π-bridges, are designed to investigate the impact of fluorine substituted π-bridges on photovoltaic performance. In comparison with BDTP-4F, BDTP-2F has a slightly red-shifted absorption spectrum but has a higher HOMO level, indicating that the increment of fluorine substitutions on the phenyl π-bridge blue-shifts the absorption spectrum and down-shifts the HOMO level of small molecules. Particularly, much different photovoltaic performance is obtained when applying Y6 as an acceptor to blend with BDTP-2F and BDTP-4F as donors, respectively. The device based on BDTP-2F:Y6 yields a power-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.21%, while a much lower PCE of 5.76% is achieved for the BDTP-4F:Y6-based device, ascribing to the different morphological properties of the blend films. The results demonstrate that the engineering of fluorine substitutions on the π-bridge is an effective strategy to manipulate the photovoltaic properties of small-molecule donor materials.

Design, System, Application
To design high-performance small molecule donors for organic solar cells, it is desirable to rationally manipulate their energy levels, absorption features, and molecular packing behaviors via a feasible chemical strategy. The present work provides an example regarding the impact of a fluorine substituted π-bridge on the photovoltaic performance of organic small-molecule donor materials. It is worth noting that the increment of fluorine substitutions on a phenyl unit as a π-bridge of small molecules blue-shifts the absorption spectrum while down-shifts the HOMO level, and negatively impacts the charge kinetic behaviors and morphological properties of the Y6-based blend films resulting in poorer photovoltaic performance. This study provides a feasible molecular design strategy to develop high-performance small molecule donors.

1. Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have drawn extensive attention during the past several decades on account of their unique merits of lightweight, flexibility, transparency, and potential low cost.1–6 With the rapid development in photovoltaic materials, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have been driven to over 18%.7,8 Relative to polymer organic semiconductors, small-molecule materials possess attractive advantages of defined chemical structures, higher purity, and better batch-to-batch repeatability.9–13 Nevertheless, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all-small molecule-based OSCs lag behind devices with conjugated polymer donors and small-molecule acceptors.14–18 Therefore, it is essential to understand the chemical structure–property relationships to rationally develop small-molecule semiconductors for high-performance all small-molecule OSCs.
Regarding the small-molecule donor semiconductor design, small molecules with an A–π–D–π–A (A = acceptor unit and D = donor unit) architecture are representative donor materials which exhibit promising photovoltaic performance.9,12,19 The absorption features, energy levels, and crystalline properties of this kind of semiconductor can be easily adjusted by applying molecular design criteria on the central donor unit20–26 and terminal acceptor unit.27–29 Meanwhile, the substitutions on the π-bridge units of small molecules are sensitive to the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties;30 however, a systematic investigation of this issue is lacking. In contrast, extensive molecular manipulations conducted on the π-bridge of conjugated polymers have been demonstrated as effective strategies to improve the photovoltaic performance. For instance, the fluorine substitutions on the phenyl unit as a π-bridge show a significant effect on the photovoltaic performance of polymer donors.31–37 The introduction of fluorine atoms into the molecular backbone favors the down-shifting of the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) level,38,39 and they can serve as intramolecular conformational locks via intramolecular noncovalent coulombic interactions (e.g., F⋯H and F⋯S interactions) toward a self-planarized structure and compact packing of polymer chains in the film state for efficient charge transport.40
To further exploit the effect of π-bridges in small-molecule donor design, two small molecules (namely BDTP-2F and BDTP-4F, as shown in Fig. 1) with various fluorine substitutions on a phenyl unit as a π-bridge are designed and synthesized in this work. BDTP-2F has a red-shifted absorption spectrum of ca. 10 nm and a 0.14 eV up-shifted HOMO level compared to BDTP-4F. In particular, much different photovoltaic performance is observed when blending BDTP-2F and BDTP-4F with Y6 as an acceptor, respectively. The BDTP-2F:Y6-based OSCs demonstrated a high PCE of 10.21%, while a significantly lower PCE of 5.76% was obtained in the BDTP-4F:Y6-based device. The better photovoltaic performance of BDTP-2F compared to that of BDTP-4F is attributed to the higher and more balanced charge carrier mobility and more effective exciton dissociation. The results demonstrate that the fluorine substituted π-bridge shows a positive effect on the design of small molecule donors with a deep HOMO level for achieving a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) in OSCs (summarized in Fig. S1 and Table S1 in the ESI†).

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Physicochemical properties
The synthetic routes of BDTP-2F and BDTP-4F are shown in Scheme 1 and their detailed synthetic procedures are described in the Experimental section. The normalized ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of BDTP-2F and BDTP-4F in the solution and film are shown in Fig. 2a. The maximum absorption peaks of BDTP-2F and BDTP-4F in solution are located at 489 and 472 nm, respectively. In comparison with the absorption spectrum in dilute solution, the absorption edges of the BDTP-2F and BDTP-4F films red-shift from ca. 60 and 58 nm to 626 and 615 nm, corresponding to bandgaps of 1.98 and 2.02 eV, respectively (Table 1). The two molecules show complementary absorption with Y6, respectively (Fig. 2b). Clear vibronic shoulder peaks at 558 and 554 nm are observed for the BDTP-2F and BDTP-4F thin films, respectively, indicating the existence of strong π–π stacking between the molecular backbones. We then performed differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements to investigate the crystalline properties of the two molecules. As shown in Fig. 2c, BDTP-2F exhibits an endothermic peak at 213 °C and an exothermic peak at 185 °C, while BDTP-4F shows higher endothermic and exothermic peaks at 234 and 214 °C, respectively. The results indicate the crystalline structure of the two molecules. Meanwhile, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed to further study the crystalline properties of the two molecules. As shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI,† the pristine BDTP-2F thin film showed a strong diffraction lamellar (100) peak at 2θ = 5.01°, corresponding to the interlayer d-spacing of 17.6 Å, whereas the BDTP-4F thin film exhibited a higher and sharper (100) peak at 2θ = 4.96°, with a longer d-spacing of 17.8 Å. The results indicate the larger aggregation size and higher ordering packing structure of the BDTP-4F film compared to those of BDTP-2F.

The electronic energy levels of the two molecules were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (as shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI†). The HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of BDTP-2F were estimated to be −5.40 and −3.53 eV, respectively, while BDTP-4F shows a lower HOMO level of −5.54 eV and a similar LUMO level of −3.54 eV compared with BDTP-2F (Fig. 2d).
Density functional theory (DFT) calculation at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level was performed to calculate the optimal geometries of BDTP-2F and BDTP-4F. All of the alkyl side chains were replaced with methyl groups to simplify the calculations. As shown in Fig. 3a, the BDTP-4F backbone shows smaller torsional angles of 0.9° and 2.7° compared to the BDTP-2F backbone (2.0° and 10.6°), suggesting that the increment of fluorine atoms on the phenyl unit as a π bridge led to better planarity of the molecule. The DFT-calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels of BDTP-2F and BDTP-4F are −5.10/−2.87 and −5.18/−2.93 eV, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3b. The tendency of the energy levels obtained from DFT calculation is consistent with the CV measurements.

2.2. Photovoltaic properties
The OSCs were fabricated with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ BDTP-2F (or BDTP-4F):Y6/PDINO/Al (Fig. 4a) to investigate the photovoltaic properties of the two small molecule donors. A variety of weight ratios of the donor/acceptor were scanned to optimize the device performance. The optimal ratio is determined to be 1:1 (w/w) for the BDTP-2F and BDTP-4F-based devices, with a PCE of 6.82% and 5.50%, respectively (as shown in Table S2 and Fig. S4 in the ESI†). Further optimization of the two devices involves thermal annealing (TA) at various temperatures, enabling better photovoltaic performance (as shown in Table 2). Fig. 4c shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the two optimal devices. By treating the BDTP-2F:Y6 (1:1, w/w) blend with thermal annealing at 150 °C for 2 minutes, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) values of the device were effectively enhanced to 23.24 mA cm−2 and 0.512 as compared to those of the as-cast device, respectively, leading to a higher PCE of 10.21%. Meanwhile, other TA temperatures either lower or higher than 150 °C for the BDTP-2F:Y6 (1:1, w/w) blend resulted in poorer PCEs, due to the much poorer FF values (as shown in Table 2 and Fig. S4 in the ESI†). In comparison with the as-cast devices, the TA treatments at 150 °C for the BDTP-4F-based device led to a slightly higher PCE of 5.76%, with a Voc of 0.850 V, a Jsc of 16.72 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.404. Due to the lower Jsc and FF, the BDTP-4F-based device showed a much lower PCE compared to the BDTP-2F-based device (Table 2 and Fig. S4 in the ESI†).

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the two optimal devices are shown in Fig. 4d. The two devices exhibit a similar photon-to-electron response wavelength from 300–950 nm, while the BDTP-2F-based device shows significantly higher EQE values in the wavelength range from 350 to 850 nm compared to the BDTP-4F-based device, corresponding to the higher Jsc. The integrated Jsc values obtained from the EQE curves for the two devices are consistent with those obtained from J–V measurement.
2.3. Charge carrier transport and carrier recombination
The charge-carrier mobility and dynamic of the devices were investigated to understand the difference of the photovoltaic performance between the BDTP-2F and BDTP-4F-based OSCs. Firstly, we quantified the charge transport properties of the pristine films and the optimized blends with the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. As shown in Table 3 and Fig. S5 in the ESI,† the BDTP-2F:Y6 blend shows a higher hole mobility (μh) of 1.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 than the BDTP-4F:Y6 blend with μh of 8.70 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a slightly higher electron mobility (μe) (6.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1vs. 6.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The higher charge mobility for the BDTP-2F:Y6 blend compared to that for the BDTP-4F:Y6 blend effectively contributes to the higher Jsc and FF.

Then, we measured the dependence of Voc on the incident light intensity (Plight) and plotted the Voc value on the logarithmic dependence of Plight (Voc ∝ lnPlight, see Fig. 5a) to study the degree of trap-assisted recombination of the two devices.41 The linear relationship with a slope of 1 kT q−1 (k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, Kelvin temperature and elementary charge, respectively) indicates that bimolecular recombination is the dominant mechanism in the device, while a slope of 2 kT q−1 suggests that the dominant mechanism is monomolecular or trap-assisted recombination.41 As displayed in Fig. 5a, the slopes of the BDTP-2F and BDTP-4F-based devices were fitted to be 0.94 kT q−1 and 0.91 kT q−1, respectively, indicating that the dominant mechanism is bimolecular recombination in the two devices. Meanwhile, the dependence of the current density on Plight, following the relation of Jsc ∝ Plightα (α is the recombination parameter and it should be equal to 1 if the bimolecular recombination is negligible), is employed to investigate the charge carrier recombination in the devices.42 As shown in the plots of log Jscvs. logPlight in Fig. 5b, the α value (the slope of the fitted line) for the BDTP-2F and BDTP-4F-based devices is fitted to be 0.927 and 0.905, respectively, implying that the BDTP-2F-based device has weaker bimolecular recombination compared to the BDTP-4F-based device.

Moreover, we measured the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of effective applied voltage (Veff).43 The Jph reached saturation (Jsat) at a large reverse bias (Veff = 2 V) indicating that all of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs were dissociated into free carriers and collected by the electrodes. Thus, the charge dissociation efficiency of the devices can be evaluated by exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss), which is determined by normalizing Jph/Jsat. As shown in Fig. 5c, a Pdiss of 81% was obtained in the BDTP-2F-based device, which is higher than the Pdiss of 75% in the BDTP-4F-based device. In order to further understand the process of charge generation and collection of the devices, moreover, transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements were performed to further evaluate the photocarrier lifetime (τ) in the two devices. As shown in Fig. 5d, the carrier lifetime in the BDTP-2F:Y6 and BDTP-4F:Y6-based devices was determined to be τ = 1.20 and 2.35 μs, respectively. As compared with the BDTP-4F:Y6-based device, the shorter carrier lifetime in the BDTP-2F:Y6-based device may be ascribed to the weaker bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination, which contributes to the better FF and Jsc values in the BDTP-2F:Y6-based device.
2.4. Morphological analysis
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out to study the top surface of the BDTP-2F:Y6 and BDTP-4F:Y6 blend films. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, the BDTP-2F:Y6 blend showed uniform phase separation and a root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of 1.31 nm, while an uneven and larger domain phase with a slightly smaller Rq of 1.28 nm was observed in the BDTP-4F:Y6 blend film. Furthermore, the BHJ film morphology of the two blend films was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As displayed in Fig. 6c and f, the BDTP-2F:Y6 blend exhibits a fibrous morphology with well-developed phase separation, while over aggregations with larger domains are observed in the BDTP-4F:Y6 blend. Additionally, the XRD measurement results (Fig. S2b in the ESI†) revealed that the BDTP-2F:Y6 blend featured a clear lamellar (100) peak at 2θ of 5.43° (d-spacing = 16.3 Å), while a sharper and more intense lamellar (100) peak at 2θ of 5.07° was observed in BDTP-4F:Y6 (d-spacing = 17.4 Å), further demonstrating that a larger domain size of the crystalline structure was realized in the BDTP-4F:Y6 blend as compared to the BDTP-2F:Y6 blend. Above all, the better BHJ morphology realized in the BDTP-2F:Y6 blend compared to that in the BDTP-4F:Y6 blend enables enhanced interfacial phase separation and charge transport that effectively promote the exciton dissociation and weaken charge recombination, ultimately contributing to the boost in Jsc and FF values.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we investigate the impact of fluorine substituted π-bridges on the photovoltaic performance of organic small molecule donors by designing two analogue molecules, BDTP-2F with difluorobenzene as π-bridges and BDTP-4F with tetrafluorobenzene as π-bridges. It is worth noting that the increment of fluorine substitutions on a phenyl unit as a π-bridge for the small molecules blue-shifts the absorption spectrum while down-shifts the HOMO level. Particularly, much different photovoltaic performance is obtained for the two donors when applying Y6 as the acceptor. The device based on BDTP-2F:Y6 yielded a PCE of 10.21%, while the BDTP-4F:Y6-based device showed a much lower PCE of 5.76%, ascribing to the lower exciton dissociation efficiency, stronger charge recombination, and larger phase separation. Our results reveal that the fine tuning of the energy level and phase separation via π-bridge design is a feasible strategy to optimize the molecular structure of photovoltaic materials towards better photovoltaic performance.

Design, System, Application
To design high-performance small molecule donors for organic solar cells, it is desirable to rationally manipulate their energy levels, absorption features, and molecular packing behaviors via a feasible chemical strategy. The present work provides an example regarding the impact of a fluorine substituted π-bridge on the photovoltaic performance of organic small-molecule donor materials. It is worth noting that the increment of fluorine substitutions on a phenyl unit as a π-bridge of small molecules blue-shifts the absorption spectrum while down-shifts the HOMO level, and negatively impacts the charge kinetic behaviors and morphological properties of the Y6-based blend films resulting in poorer photovoltaic performance. This study provides a feasible molecular design strategy to develop high-performance small molecule donors.
