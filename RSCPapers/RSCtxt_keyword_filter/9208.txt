    , Accepted 4th December 2020First published on 7th December 2020AbstractFor the last decade, two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their unique physical and chemical properties. Novel devices based on these materials are commonly fabricated using the exfoliated samples, which lacks control of the thickness and cannot be scaled. Therefore, the synthesis of large-area TMDC thin films with a high uniformity to advance the field is required. This article reviews the latest advances in the synthesis of wafer-scale thin films using chemical vapor deposition methods. The key factors that determine the electrical performance of TMDCs are introduced, including the interfacial properties and defects. The latest solution-based techniques which suggest the opportunity to obtain large-area TMDC thin films with a low-cost process and the potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics are also discussed. The outlook for future research directions, challenges, and possible development of 2D materials are further discussed.
Introduction
The discovery of graphene has created huge interest from researchers all over the world. Over the past decade, the family of 2D materials has expanded to include hundreds of members, many of which have been successfully synthesized, such as black phosphorus (BP),1–3 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN).4 Although graphene possesses many excellent properties (chemical, mechanical and electronic properties),5–9 the zero bandgap10 limits its application in semiconductor devices. Compared to graphene, 2D TMDCs exhibit diverse properties from metals (e.g., NbTe2, TaS2), semimetals (e.g., TiSe2, WTe2), and superconductors (e.g., NbS2, PdTe2), to semiconductors with bandgaps ranging from 0.5 to 3 eV (e.g., MoSe2, HfS2).11 These promising materials can be applied in various photonic and optoelectronic devices, such as light-emitting devices, transistors, and photovoltaic devices.12–14
Similar to graphene, mechanical exfoliation can be used to prepare 2D TMDCs.15–18 Mechanical peeling can produce high-quality few-layer 2D nanosheets, which is suitable for lab-scale research. Most prototype devices are fabricated based on this simple and low-cost method,19–21 the mechanical exfoliation method that can result in very high-quality devices but cannot generate continuous or scalable films needed for industrial applications. Therefore, to transform devices based on 2D TMDCs from laboratory research to industrial applications, it is necessary to develop a scalable synthesis method to achieve high-quality, wafer-scale 2D TMDCs.
In this review, we first summarize the latest advances in the synthesis of wafer-scale continuous TMDC films by various chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods,22–25 including atmospheric-pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD), low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD), plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), and metal–organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), and summarize both advantages and disadvantages of these methods. We also attempt to provide a reference for the realization of industrial-scale applications using TMDCs. Moreover, we summarize the recent advances in the solution-based preparation of TMDCs as effective protocols to realize large-scale thin films and low-cost production. In comparison with CVD methods, solution-based synthesis methods possess several advantages, such as simplicity, low growth temperature, composition controllability, and high versatility. Finally, we discuss a variety of electronic and optoelectronic device applications based on TMDCs, and the challenges and future research directions associated with this field.
Large-scale synthesis of TMDCs by CVD methods
Many pieces of research have been devoted to the development of new methods for large-scale synthesis of TMDC films. CVD is considered to be the most likely synthesis method for realizing high-quality large-area 2D TMDCs at a low cost. This section will introduce the above CVD methods, analyze the large-scale synthesis mechanism, and add several applications related to 2D TMDCs.
APCVD
APCVD refers to a method of chemical vapor deposition performed at atmospheric pressure. It is the earliest used CVD method, with a simple structure and easy operation, and can be carried out in several reactors with different shapes. Metal oxides or volatile metal halides are sublimated at high temperatures, mixed with chalcogenide vapor carried by carrier gases such as H2, Ar, or N2, and evenly transported to a high-temperature substrate in the reaction chamber to form an ultrathin TMDC film on the substrate.
At present, large-area TMDC crystals and films have been fabricated by the APCVD method. Using molybdenum oxide and selenium powders as the precursors of molybdenum and selenium, Gong et al. succeeded in synthesizing a continuous millimeter-scale MoSe2 film on a SiO2 substrate (Fig. 1a). The MoSe2 single-crystal domain reaches 1.3 mm.26 Chen et al. introduced a contrast group in APCVD to prove that molted glass can promote the growth of the MoSe2 single crystal.27 The MoSe2 thin film is grown in the same system; the MoSe2 single crystal obtained on the molten substrate (Fig. 1b left) is larger than that on the SiO2 substrate (Fig. 1b right).

Many factors affect the APCVD synthesis of two-dimensional TMDCs, such as precursors, promoters, substrates, surface treatments, and so on.28 While MoTe2 was synthesized on a SiO2 substrate, the side reaction of Te and Si produced SiTe and Si2Te3, resulting in the inability to obtain MoTe2. Zhou et al. introduced molecular sieves into the CVD system to absorb the silicon telluride byproducts. Thus, MoTe2 can be successfully synthesized.29 By placing the substrates on top of each other (Fig. 1c left), the 1T′ phase and 2H phase of large-scale continuous MoTe2 were obtained on the same SiO2 substrate simultaneously (Fig. 1c right). The MoTe2 film was synthesized in Region 4 and Region 5 after the introduction of the molecular sieve. In contrast, the MoTe2 film could not be obtained in Regions 1, 2, and 3 without the molecular sieve. Besides, in the region where the substrate is placed overlapping, the 2H phase of MoTe2 is obtained. In the opened area, the 1T′ phase of MoTe2 is obtained. This study proves that the substrate plays a very important role in the synthesis of TMDCs. The substrate has a modulating effect on the phase of the synthesized TMDC monolayer. The substrate can be treated differently to obtain the required TMDC phase.
Moreover, the promoter has been extensively used recently. Kim et al. investigated the role of an alkali metal promoter in growing monolayer TMDCs and explained the mechanism.30 The authors formulated an alkali metal promoter and a water-soluble transition metal precursor into a solution, spin-coated it on a substrate to form a precursor/promoter layer, and then performed APCVD synthesis. During the reaction, the intermediate compound such as Na2MoO4 clusters was formed and embedded on the substrate surface. The proposed mechanism of the cluster formation is shown in Fig. 1d. Oxygen reacted with the carbon and hydrogen components in the precursor. Na, Mo, and O sources aggregated at high temperature to form Na2MoO4 and then reacted further with SiO2 to generate a thermodynamically stable Na–Mo–Si–O compound. The compound can enhance the wettability of the precursor to the substrate, have a pinning effect on the MoS2 film, and improve the uniformity of the film.
Furthermore, the precursor supply methods are also essential, and Lee et al. developed a new precursor supply method.31 A very small amount of MoO3 powder was dissolved in ammonium hydroxide, and the solution was spin-coated on a SiO2 substrate (Fig. 1e). Thus, a precursor film is formed with a uniform film thickness. After APCVD growth, a highly crystalline millimeter-scale MoS2 film is obtained. The obtained MoS2 film presents a high quality with excellent optical performance.
In addition, Xu et al. found that Mo and Te would rearrange under appropriate conditions, and the MoTe2 film changes from a polycrystalline 1T′ phase to single-crystal 2H phase.32 The authors synthesized a centimeter-scale seamless 1T′-2H coplanar heterostructure (Fig. 1f). A 1–1.5 nm thick Mo film was firstly deposited on the Si/SiO2 substrate by magnetron sputtering, following by the tellurization process in the APCVD system to obtain MoTe2. As the growth time increases, the MoTe2 film gradually transforms from the 1T′ phase to 2H phase. 2H-MoTe2 continuously expands and combines each other from a circle, and finally forms a uniform 2H-MoTe2 film. This study provided a solution for the precise control of the phase of TMDCs.
The latest research shows that the size of the monolayer TMDC domain has expanded to hundreds of microns or even millimeters. Despite these achievements, the main disadvantage of this growth process by vapor transport is that it is extremely difficult to introduce only single nucleation, and the resulting crystal domain size is still too small to be compatible with highly integrated devices. In contrast, the multi-nucleation method relies on a lattice-matched substrate, which enables epitaxial TMDC domains to grow in the same orientation and then to combine into single-crystal films. Therefore, controlling the orientation of crystal domains and suppressing the formation of grain boundaries are key issues for the growth of TMDC single crystals. In view of this, Yang et al. reported that by melting and resolidifying commercial Au foils, the epitaxial growth of wafer-level monocrystalline MoS2 monolayers was achieved on the neighboring Au (111) film (Fig. 1g).33 The unidirectional alignment and seamless splicing of MoS2 domains have been fully demonstrated using characterization techniques from the atomic level to the centimeter level. Through the combination of scanning tunneling microscopy characterization and first-principles calculations, the results show that the nucleation of the MoS2 monolayer is mainly guided by the Au (111) upper step, which leads to the growth of MoS2 along with the <110> step edge height orientation. Therefore, this work is an important step towards the practical application of the MoS2 monolayer and the large-scale integration of 2D electronic devices.
LPCVD
The principle of LPCVD is similar to that of APCVD, and the most significant difference is the pressure parameter during the deposition process. LPCVD has a higher step coverage, better film thickness uniformity, fewer structural defects, and lower nucleation density than APCVD, but the growth parameters have become more complex, and the deposition rate of LPCVD is lower than that of APCVD.
The deposition rate of LPCVD is low. This is due to the slow transport of the source under low pressure, and the powder source is easily sulfurized before reaching the substrate. Yu et al. presented a continuous monolayer MoS2 film synthesized on a 2-inch sapphire wafer using MoO3 and S powder.34 The authors have modified the system by using separate carrier gas paths to transport each precursor, i.e., Ar as the carrier gas for the S and Ar/O2 as the carrier gas for MoO3 (Fig. 2a). By adding oxygen, MoO3 can be protected from sulfurization for steady evaporation to improve growth quality.

Fig. 2b presents a typical direct sulfurization process of transition metal films.35 A Mo film with a thickness of several nanometers was first deposited on a targeted substrate by evaporation, following by sulfurization in an LPCVD system to obtain a MoS2 film. Recent research led by Lee and Jung utilized a similar method to obtain large-scale continuous MoS2 films with the controllable thickness from mono- to tri-layer by directly sulfurizing MoO3 films.36 The authors first performed Mo magnetron sputtering under an atmosphere of Ar and O2 to obtain a MoO3 thin film on a SiO2/Si substrate. The substrate was then placed in the downstream zone of a CVD furnace and heated to 650 °C for 1 hour under an atmosphere of sulfur.
By controlling the thickness of transition metals or metal oxide films, different types of TMDC films can be synthesized using the sulfurization or selenization process. However, the quality of the obtained films is poor, and their electrical properties are still inferior to those of films synthesized by the conventional CVD method. Xu et al. optimized the direct sulfurization method, and the performance of the prepared film exceeded that of all the two-step-grown monolayer MoS2 reported previously.37 The authors first deposited an epitaxial MoO2 thin film on the sapphire substrate by the pulse laser deposition process. Then the sapphire substrate was placed in a three-zone CVD furnace for sulfurization. The device performance of the synthesized film is better than that obtained by other sulfurization processes.
The source supply method and the choice of the substrate have a great influence on film synthesis and film quality. Yang et al. developed a new technique to obtain a 6-inch continuous uniform monolayer MoS2 film by face-to-face precursor supply inversion (Fig. 2c left).38 The Mo foil and S powder were used as the precursors. Mo foil was folded into a bridge shape and placed face to face on soda-lime glass (Fig. 2c right). The growth was performed under an atmosphere of Ar and O2 at a growth temperature of 720 °C. Soda-lime glass is hydrophilic. The film obtained by this method can be easily peeled and transferred using polymethyl methacrylate and water. By increasing the size of the growth chamber, a larger uniform monolayer MoS2 film can be made on the soda-lime glass, which is suitable for industrial production.
To obtain uniform and high-quality continuous monolayer MoS2 at the wafer-scale, in addition to the same orientation growth of domains, it is also necessary to maintain a uniform distribution of source concentration during the growth process. However, most of the sources selected for APCVD and LPCVD are powder sources, and the concentration of the source is largely uneven in space. Recently, through an improved LPCVD system, Wang et al. used a multi-source supply method to obtain a four-inch wafer with a high coverage MoS2 film (Fig. 2d), and the average size of MoS2 domains exceeded 100 microns.39 These monolayer MoS2 samples exhibited the best electronic performance since the report, the average carrier mobility reached 70 cm2 V−1 s−1, and the on/off current ratio reached 2 × 1010, which proves the superiority of the LPCVD system of the multi-source supply mode in the synthesis process.
PECVD
PECVD is a plasma-assisted CVD method. First, the in situ treatment of the substrate surface is needed before growth. Therefore, the substrate is placed in a plasma generated by a low-pressure glow discharge for cleaning before growth. Compared to CVD, PECVD exhibits many advantages: (1) The plasma generated by glow discharge can remove impurities by sputtering the surface of the substrate and perform in situ cleaning treatment, (2) the energy generated by ion bombardment of the surface of the substrate improves the mobility of surface atoms, thereby speeding up the reaction and (3) the reactive substances participating in the reaction are formed by high-energy plasma collision, so the temperature of the substrate can be kept at a low temperature during the reaction. PECVD has been widely used in industrial production for epitaxial Si related thin films. However, the related studies on the synthesis of TMDC films using PECVD have been limited so far.
Ahn et al. used PECVD to directly synthesize large-scale MoS2 films on plastic substrates (Fig. 3a).40 The authors first used electron beam evaporation to deposit a 1 nm thick Mo film on the polyimide (PI) substrate, followed by loading the PI substrate in the PECVD system. The synthesis was performed under a low pressure of 10−5 Torr. Argon glow discharge generates plasma, which decomposes H2S to produce the active S precursor, and the reaction temperature was in a range of 150–300 °C. Finally, few-layer MoS2 films were obtained, with a thickness of ∼4 nm. The synthesis mechanism is as follows: (1) ionization of argon, which generates charge transfer, resulting in the formation of H2S ions, (2) H2S ions bombarded and injected into the Mo layer by the electric field and (3) H2S ions sulfurize the Mo film to form a MoS2 film, H2 produced as a byproduct. CVD methods usually require very high temperatures (>600 °C), making it impossible to synthesize TMDC films directly on flexible plastic substrates. This research is expected to be used in the industry since it suggests a way to avoid the transfer step and preserve the quality of the TMDC film.

MOCVD
MOCVD is the most commonly used technique for growing compound semiconductor thin films. The MOCVD system consists of a source supply system, gas transport, a flow control system, a reaction chamber, an exhaust gas treatment system, a temperature control system, and an automatic control system. The precursors used in the MOCVD system are located outside the chamber, providing the advantage of continuous supply and precise control of the amount of precursors during growth. For the MOCVD, the choice of precursors is crucial. The sources are usually selected based on the following characteristics: they are stable at room temperature and have an adequate vapor pressure at an appropriate temperature (0–20 °C), they must be decomposed to produce the required growth elements at the desired growth temperatures and the unwanted side reactions can be avoided. Since the MOCVD sources are flammable, explosive, and highly toxic materials, safety precautions of the MOCVD system are required. Compared with CVD, MOCVD has the following advantages: (1) MOCVD can precisely control the composition and thickness of the epitaxial layer by accurately controlling the gas flow rate, (2) the gas composition in the reaction chamber can be quickly changed, and it is beneficial to epitaxial growth of the heterojunction and multiple structures and (3) the precursor is easy to volatilize and exists as a gas in the reaction chamber, the precursor is mixed more uniformly, and the quality of the grown film is more uniform. The parameters required for MOCVD epitaxial growth are temperature, precursor flow, precursor flow ratio, synthesis atmosphere, etc.
Using the MOCVD system, Kang et al.41 obtained a wafer-scale uniform MoS2 and WS2 monolayer and studied the device performance of the thin film (Fig. 3b). The authors selected molybdenum hexacarbonyl (MHC), tungsten hexacarbonyl (THC), and dimethyl sulfide (DES) as the precursors of Mo, W, and S, respectively. The obtained film is continuous at the wafer-scale by using long-time growth (∼26 hours). The absorption spectrum and Raman spectrum confirm that the film has high quality and uniformity. With the increase of the H2 flow rate, the size of the crystal domains in the synthesized films decreased significantly. For the growth of thin film with the same size, high domain density results in more grain boundaries, causing a negative effect on the electrical properties of the film. To improve the film quality, the flow of H2 should be reduced as much as possible in the process of synthesizing the MoS2 film.
Carbon contamination is a primary concern of the MOCVD system when using organometallic sources such as DES. Lin et al. used H2Se as a Se source to avoid this problem.42 They synthesized a large-area continuous WSe2 monolayer film by using H2Se as the selenium source to prevent the formation of amorphous carbon, thus improving the quality of the WSe2 film compared to the film synthesized by diethyl selenium. The author constructed bottom gate field-effect transistors based on this WSe2 film, with a carrier mobility of 30 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off current ratio of 107. The carrier mobility of WSe2 films synthesized based on diethyl selenium and dimethyl selenium is only 2 cm2 V−1 s−1. Besides, the purity of the H2Se source plays a vital role in realizing the electronic-grade of the synthesized film. The device consisting of a WSe2 film presented a performance close to that of the one built on a single-crystal.
Moreover, Zhang et al. developed a multi-step MOCVD growth process (Fig. 3c) and obtained a WSe2 monolayer film with excellent uniformity under the optimal parameters.43 The flow rate of H2Se remained constant (7 sccm) throughout the process. The substrate was heated, and when the growth temperature was reached, tungsten hexacarbonyl was introduced into the reaction chamber at a relatively high flow rate for 30 seconds. A high-density WSex cluster appeared on the sapphire substrate. After removing W(CO)6 from the inlet and annealing the sample in H2Se for 15 min, the density of WSex clusters decreased, and WSe2 domains with a uniform size were formed. Hexacarbonyl tungsten was then passed into the reaction chamber at a lower flow rate to limit nucleation and promote lateral growth of the crystal domains. The control of nucleation density and the lateral growth rate is the major challenge to obtain fewer grain boundaries and a highly uniform thin film and thus improve the quality of TMDCs. This research gave an insight into the fundamental growth process and provided a method to minimize the growth of the film in three dimensions.
Developing a fast and large-scale synthesis approach for uniform monolayer TMDCs is a significant challenge to realize the industrial production of TMDCs and the application in electric fields. At present, MOCVD is the most promising synthesis method to achieve this goal. Although MOCVD is slow and expensive, MOCVD has advantages that other CVD methods do not have, such as better source uniformity and better source controllability. Although existing studies have shown that some researchers have synthesized large-area TMDC monolayers through traditional CVD, their domain size and electronic properties show poor spatial uniformity. In addition, the commonly used powder vaporization routes (such as MoO3 and S powder in MoS2) require higher growth temperatures and are limited in the continuous supply of precursors during the growth process, making them unsuitable for integration into existing electronic manufacturing processes. In MOCVD, the decomposition temperature range of most metal precursors is less than about 400 °C, and the growth temperature of TMDCs is low, which is beneficial to the future CMOS compatible semiconductor industry. The research led by Eswaran proposed a solution to the problem of time.44 By using a liquid precursor for the Mo source (i.e., bis(tertbutylimido) bis(dimethylamido) molybdenum) and hydrogen sulfide gas, the authors demonstrated that 2-inch wafer MoS2 could be obtained within 4 min of growth time. This research paves a new way for the widespread industrial production of TMDC films. Seol et al. also achieved the rapid synthesis of the TMDC monolayer through a pulsed intermittent supply source.45 The author used a high precursor partial pressure during the synthesis process, which makes the secondary nucleation on the TMDC film easier. To achieve rapid layer-by-layer growth, the author's strategy is to periodically interrupt the supply of precursors. Fig. 3d shows a schematic diagram of the growth of TMDs. In the initial growth stage, the surface coverage of TMDCs is low, heterogeneous nucleation occurs on the substrate, and vertical growth is rarely observed. This is because the possibility of reaching metal and chalcogen atoms on SiO2 is higher than the TMD nucleation point. After reaching a certain coverage, the higher atom density will drive the secondary nucleation on the TMDC surface. The author interrupted the precursor supply two minutes after introducing the precursor. The unstable MoSx (or WSx) clusters formed on the pre-synthesized TMDC could not reach the critical nucleation size, and the adsorbed atoms were more inclined to attach to the edge in terms of energy. In the precursor interruption step, the remaining atoms and unstable clusters below the critical nucleation size may move to the edge of the pre-synthesized TMDC through surface diffusion (vertical Ostwald ripening). Repeated precursor injection and interruption can inhibit vertical growth and drive layer-by-layer growth mode. Simulation and experimental results also confirmed the correctness of this growth model. After four growth cycles, a TMDC monolayer with high coverage was obtained. However, the quality of the film synthesized by this method is average, the carrier mobility and switching are relatively poor, and the subsequent parameters need to be optimized.
Besides, the substrates selected for the MOCVD method are generally SiO2, fused glass, and sapphire. None of these can meet the substrates required to build flexible and transparent devices. It is necessary to perform epitaxial growth through the MOCVD method, and then transfer the film to a flexible substrate before making a flexible device. During the transfer process, it is inevitable that the film will be damaged, and impurities will be introduced, which will cause the quality of the film to deteriorate, and ultimately affect the performance of the device. Shinde et al. developed a new transfer method that enables the complete transfer of wafer-scale films.46Fig. 3e shows the synthesis and transfer process. They performed silanol functionalization on SiO2 substrates with dilute hydrofluoric acid and then performed MOCVD growth on the treated substrates. The film can be completely detached from the substrate using water and transferred to the flexible substrate. The device fabricated from the transferred film exhibited excellent performance. This study shows that the damage to the film caused by the transfer step can be minimized.
In summary, all CVD methods can synthesize large-area TMDC films, but the parameters of films prepared by different CVD methods have divergence, such as the domain size, continuity, film quality, layer quantity, etc. We summarize the similarities and differences of various CVD methods (Table 1) and analyze the impact of these differences in the synthesis. 2D TMDCs are expected to become the next generation of semiconductor materials. To realize industrial applications, it is necessary to realize the synthesis of high-quality TMDC single-crystal films or ultra-large domain films. Currently, the domain size of wafer-scale continuous TMDC films is only a few hundred microns, and films have more grain boundaries, which significantly reduces performance, so we need to carefully optimize growth parameters and processes, or invent new synthetic systems.

One of the key challenges in the CVD synthesis of TMDC single-crystal films is the delivery of transition metal (TM) precursors and chalcogen precursors to the substrate surface in a controlled manner. In this process, it is necessary to ensure that the precursor is sufficiently and uniformly transported to produce a uniformly distributed flux of stable reactants above the substrate. The carrier gas assisted delivery organic source strategy may be a high-quality solution strategy. The precursor used in MOCVD has a high vapor pressure, which can form a stable vapor flux during the carrier gas assisted delivery process to ensure uniform delivery of the precursor. This strategy can accurately control the delivery of precursors by controlling the flow of carrier gas, and can precisely control the number of TMDC layers, but this strategy introduces more parameters that need to be controlled. In addition, the CVD synthesis method will introduce more impurities, leading to structural defects, wrinkles and contaminants. This is also an urgent problem to be solved. The second key challenge is nucleation control. If effective control methods are not used, the initial nuclei are often randomly distributed and oriented, resulting in the formation of a large number of grain boundaries during the merger between these regions. Suppression of nucleation is an effective way to reduce grain boundaries. By manipulating the amount of hydrogen and introducing alkali metal halides or oxygen, the controllable nucleation density can be achieved. The third key challenge is doping engineering. Electronic devices based on TMDC films require controllable doping engineering to adjust the carrier type and carrier density. Conventional doping techniques are not suitable for 2D TMDCs. The doped elements will cause surface damage and degrade device performance. Surface charge transfer doping is considered to be a non-destructive technique, and effectively modulates the properties of TMDC films, but its applicability, efficiency and stability need to be considered. The introduction of high-k dielectrics on the surface of TMDCs may be an effective method to suppress charge impurities.
Device applications
In the past decade, 2D TMDCs have promoted substantial research efforts in the fields of electronics and optoelectronics. However, a high percentage of these devices are based on the mechanical exfoliation method, which makes it impossible for practical application. The exploration of wafer-level TMDC-based devices is still in its preliminary stages. Nevertheless, their manufacturing process is more compatible with traditional CMOS manufacturing processes, and there is a huge room for improving material quality, which can significantly promote their device applications. This section introduces the latest developments in electronic and optoelectronic devices based on wafer-scale TMDCs in recent years.

Electronic devices. 
MoS2 has excellent electrical properties and is used as an n-type material in most cases. Therefore, complementary logic circuits can only be manufactured by using p-type materials and MoS2 to form a heterogeneous combination. However, most complementary logic inverters based on MoS2 are made by mechanical stripping and complex chemical doping, lacking repeatability and reliability, and are not suitable for large integrated circuits. Das et al. designed and manufactured a large-area flexible hybrid logic device based on wafer-level MoS2 thin-film synthesis by CVD (Fig. 4a).64 The authors used Si as a p-type material and MoS2 as an n-type material to form a complementary heterostructure inverter. Si-TFT was produced through top–down technology and then combined with a CVD-grown MoS2 thin film by a transfer method. The maximum voltage gain of the inverter reaches 16 (Fig. 4b), and the total noise margin is higher. Besides, the authors have constructed a flexible inverter on a plastic substrate. This research is expected to be put into large-scale industrial production.

Similarly, Dathbun et al. constructed large-area ReS2 transistors and logic gates on large-scale ReS2 films synthesized by CVD.65 The authors used ReO3 and H2S as precursors to synthesize wafer-scale multilayer ReS2 thin films on SiO2 substrates. A monolayer of graphene grown by CVD was used as the source/drain electrode, and the graphene electrode was bonded to the ReS2 film by a transfer method to form a transistor (Fig. 4c and d). The electron mobility of the transistor is 0.44 cm2 V−1 s−1, the switching ratio exceeds 104, and the turn-on voltage is −0.4 V. Although the carrier mobility and on/off current ratio of the ReS2 device are poor, this research has realized the large-scale synthesis of ReS2 and the construction of large-area array devices, which has a reference value for ReS2 materials. Interestingly, the tunability of the graphene electrode gate leads to high-quality contact with ReS2. Compared to the devices using Cr electrodes, the contact resistance is greatly reduced, and the device performance is significantly improved.
The industrial application of TMDC films is currently difficult to achieve. Although the performance of TMDC devices based on the mechanical peeling method is excellent, it cannot meet the needs of mass production. The device array based on the wafer-scale TMDC film is easier to achieve industrial production. The problem is that the TMDC film in the current wafer-scale research is polycrystalline, and the grain boundary will cause the device performance to decrease. Xu et al. improved the previously reported CVD synthesis technology, obtained high-quality continuous MoS2 films, and designed and manufactured inverters with better performance.24 They used a face-to-face approach to supply Mo precursors. Using MoS2 FET as a pull-up FET and a pull-down FET implements a pseudo-logic inverter (Fig. 4e). Introducing multiple layers of MoS2 islands on the MoS2 film improves electrode contact and high-k dielectric deposition, and reduces contact resistance. The performance has been significantly improved, the average effective mobility has reached 70 cm2 V−1 s−1, the sub-threshold swing is about 150 mV dec−1, and the peak voltage gain of the inverter has reached 23 (Fig. 4f). These properties are comparable to those of a mechanically peeled monolayer or multilayer TMDC film. In addition, Pu et al. reported a high-performance monolayer TMDC high-performance CMOS inverter.66 They have fabricated WSe2 and MoS2 electric double layer transistors (EDLTs) using ion gel dielectrics and have grown highly crystalline centimeter-scale uniform WSe2 monolayer thin films using CVD systems. For the source and drain electrodes of two bipolar EDLTs, three Au contacts are thermally deposited on the film surface. The ion gel was drop-cast onto the WSe2 film, and the Pt foil was placed on top of the gel film as a grid electrode. Finally, the gold quasi-reference electrode was inserted into the gel membrane. The CMOS inverter has excellent performance, with a voltage gain of up to 110, a large noise margin, and low power consumption. It is currently the highest performance device based on wafer-scale TMDC films (Fig. 4g).
Flexible electronic devices have a wide range of uses, including wearable sensors, electronic skins, flexible displays, and energy converters. An important trend in this field is the large-scale development of high-performance electronic devices. TMDCs have been able to achieve wafer-level synthesis and have a good application prospect in the field of flexible electronic devices. Li et al. used an improved LPCVD system to grow wafer-scale TMDC monolayers with large grain sizes and used Au/Ti/Au electrodes to generate contact resistances as low as 2.9 kΩ μm−1 (Fig. 4h).67 The fabricated field-effect transistor has a high device density (1518 per cm2) and has a high on/off current ratio (1010), current density (∼35 μA μm−1), and mobility (∼55 cm2 V−1 s−1). The author also uses this method to build various flexible integrated logic circuits: inverters, NOR gates, NAND gates, AND gates, static random access memory and five-stage ring oscillators. The inverter can achieve high voltage gains of 43 and 107 when the bias voltage Vdd = 2 V and 4 V, respectively. The five-stage ring oscillator can achieve a stable oscillation frequency of 13.12 MHz when Vdd = 15 V. This research work provides a method for preparing large-scale flexible integrated MoS2 devices, which is expected to develop flexible electronic devices for computing, communication, sensing and information storage.
In the current study of monolayer or few-layer TMDCs, the highest carrier mobility that can be achieved is far lower than the theoretically predicted value. There are many reasons for this situation, such as the internal defects of the TMDC film during the synthesis process and the potential external scattering sources. The research of Cui et al. developed a van der Waals heterostructure device platform, which shields external scattering through the encapsulation of h-BN. The device structure is shown in Fig. 4i.68 The MoS2 film is completely encapsulated in the h-BN, and the gate tunable graphene is used as an electrode to contact the MoS2 film. The author separately produced and measured a series of MoS2 devices with different thicknesses. The experiment proved that h-BN has a good packaging effect, and can effectively shield external scattering and disorder, and intrinsic electron–phonon scattering can be observed at room temperature, and carrier mobility can reach 120 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature and 34000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at low temperature (10 K). The large-area synthesis of h-BN has been realized, and the packaging platform of this structure is expected to realize large-area integrated production. In addition to reducing external scattering and improving the performance of TMDC devices, h-BN can effectively inhibit the photodegradation of TMDCs. Ahn et al. demonstrated the photodegradation of WSe2 and MoSe2,69 and the encapsulation of h-BN reduced this photodegradation. Under the laser power greater than 0.1 mW, WSe2 begins to degrade. After the introduction of the water droplets, the degradation rate of WSe2 under 0.1 mW laser power increased sharply, and it was almost completely degraded in 200 s. After using three-layer h-BN to encapsulate WSe2, there is no degradation under 0.1 mW power, and more than 90% PL peak can be maintained after 700 s under 2 mW power.


Optoelectronic devices. 
2D TMDCs have excellent optoelectronic properties. So they are most promising to use for achieving the widespread application of atomic thickness electroluminescent devices. Sundaram et al. achieved Schottky-contact between single-layer MoS2 and Au/Cr electrodes and constructed a monolayer TMDC electroluminescent device.70 By applying a large bias voltage to the device, hot carriers with certain kinetic energy are generated, excitons are excited at the interface between MoS2 and the electrode, and exciton recombination generates electroluminescence (EL). Although this study has low quantum efficiency, it avoids the problem of selectively doped nanostructures (Fig. 5a and b). Cheng et al. constructed a new type of p–n diode based on MoS2 and WSe2 thin films synthesized by CVD.71 The diode has excellent current rectification performance with an ideal factor of 1.2 and an EQE of 12%. The EL intensity of this diode is a function related to the input current, showing a linear relationship in a monolayer WSe2 p–n junction, and a sub-linear relationship in a bilayer (Fig. 5c and d). This phenomenon is caused by monolayer and bilayer WSe2 having a direct bandgap and indirect bandgap, respectively. Ross et al. synthesized a MoSe2–WSe2 bilayer heterojunction and applied a forward bias on the heterojunction to move carriers from one layer to another to form excitons (Fig. 5e and f).72

As smart devices become thinner, wearable smart electronic systems have become a new development trend. This requires materials with thin-film, large areas, and high mechanical properties. 2D TMDCs are currently the most promising materials to satisfy these conditions. In particular, they are used to manufacture flexible light-emitting devices. Choi et al. reported a flexible OLED display driven by an active matrix backplane circuit based on a large-area MoS2 thin-film TFT (Fig. 5g).73 The authors used the Al2O3 layer to design and manufacture a new type of TFT device (Fig. 5g left) and constructed a type that can synergistically produce a uniform mobility TFT array. The Al2O3 covered TFT device reduces the contact resistance of the metal-MoS2 interface and reduces the scattered charge impurities. The array can be controlled by the gate to operate each OLED pixel effectively. This research laid the foundation for the industrial production of wearable display devices.
Monochrome organic light-emitting diodes based on MoS2 backplane circuits have proven the powerful functionality of MoS2 transistors, but only when highly complex control of red, green and blue colors is achieved on a large area can they be truly applied to OLED displays. Choi et al. reported a wearable full-color OLED display based on 2D material backplane transistors (Fig. 5h).74 By assembling an 18 × 18 thin film transistor array on MoS2 and transferring it to Al2O3 (30 nm)/PET (6 μm), three-color OLEDs of red, green and blue are constructed on the upper surface. MoS2 exhibits excellent mechanical and electrical properties in this OLED device, and has been proven to be able to drive circuits used to control OLED pixels. This kind of ultra-thin device substrate has broad application prospects and can also be integrated on unconventional substrates (i.e., human hands).
Heterogeneous optoelectronic devices based on TMDCs are also one of the research hotspots. The usual method for constructing heterostructures is to transfer TMDC films to heterogeneous materials. During the transfer process, it is inevitable that the interface of the heterojunction will be polluted. These pollutions will cause the degradation of device performance. The research of Hoang et al. realized in situ epitaxial growth of the MoS2 monolayer on wafer-scale graphene, successfully synthesized a wafer-scale MoS2/graphene heterostructure, and constructed a large-area photodetector array (Fig. 5i).75 Authors used a metal-free method to synthesize wafer-scale high-quality graphene on a sapphire substrate, and then grow MoS2in situ on the grown graphene/sapphire substrate, and obtained a wafer-scale heterojunction with a clean MoS2/graphene interface. The photodetector based on this heterojunction exhibits an ultra-high light response rate of 4.3 × 104 A W−1. This method of growing heterojunctions in situ should become a trend and gradually become the mainstream of research.


Sensing devices. 
Bio-FET transducers for label-free electrical detection of biomolecules have high sensitivity and low detection limits (LOD), so they are currently the focus of research. The bio-FET with a one-dimensional (1D) structure has been proved to be useful in monitoring biological serum. However, due to the high cost and the limitations of nanofabrication, it cannot truly achieve industrial production and service. FETs based on 2D semiconductor materials have excellent optical, electrical, and mechanical properties, so some researchers began to use 2D semiconductor materials to construct bio-FETs. Lee et al. built a biosensor based on the TMDC FET.76 The authors removed the gates in the logic transistors and modified the dielectric layer with specific acceptors. Receptors can capture target biomolecules with high selectivity. When the receptor captures a biomolecule, it generates an electrostatic gating effect and translates it into a readable signal with the electrical characteristics (drain–source current) of the FET. Fig. 6a is a schematic diagram of a typical biosensor. The biosensor has excellent sensing performance: LOD: 10 fm; dynamic range: 106; sensitivity: 17 mV dec−1.

Nowadays, the extensive use of fossil fuels produced too many harmful gases, and the detection of toxic gases is particularly essential. NO2 is the most common air pollutant in various gases due to fossil fuel combustion emissions and automobile exhaust emissions. Therefore, a sensitive sensor is needed to detect NO2 concentration in time. Xu et al. developed a NO2 sensor based on the MoS2 film and described the working mechanism of the sensor (Fig. 6b).77 When MoS2 is exposed to NO2, NO2 will be oxidized, NO2 molecules are adsorbed on MoS2 as NO2+ ions, and electrons are extracted from the valence band of MoS2. A hole layer is formed on the surface of MoS2. The hole layer makes MoS2 more conductive.
Besides, transient electronics is a new type of technology that has emerged in recent years. Materials can physically disappear or decompose in a controlled manner within a controlled time. The device constructed with this material can normally run during the service period and can degrade itself after the service period, avoiding the problems caused by recycling and collection. This material is suitable for environmental sensors and medical diagnostic equipment that are not harmful to the environment. 2D TMDCs also belong to this type of material. Chen et al. constructed an implantable multifunctional sensor on a MoS2 monolayer film (Fig. 6c and d).78 The sensor can monitor information such as intracranial pressure, temperature, and strain in animals, and its performance is comparable to that of commercially available sensors (Fig. 6e). The sensor can be controlled to self-degrade, and the time to start degradation can be changed by changing the modification layer. They studied the sensor's cytotoxicity and biocompatibility. After the sensor was implanted in mice, it showed no immune response. The sensor degrades naturally after implantation in mice without causing tissue damage and cytotoxicity. This research has a broad application prospect and may be applied in the field of clinical medicine in the future.
Besides, flexible tactile sensors are also popular research directions in recent years and can be applied to the fields of biomedicine, wearable devices, and robots. Park et al. reported an active tactile sensor that can be attached to the skin.79 A schematic and a cross-sectional view of the sensor are shown in Fig. 6f. The sensor has excellent performance, a wide sensing range (1–120 kPa), high sensitivity (ΔR/R0: 0.011 kPa−1), and fast response time (180 ms). When the sensor is connected to the palm to grasp an external object, the approximate shape of the object can be obtained based on accurate multi-point sensing. The sensor is built on an ultra-thin flexible substrate and may be applied to wearable devices and electronic skin in the future.
In the past decade, significant advancements in 2D TMDCs have led to promising electronic and optoelectronic applications. A lot of studies have been conducted on related device research, but most devices are prototype devices based on the domain obtained by the mechanical peeling method. The repeatability is poor which makes it difficult to use 2D TMDCs for practical applications. Research on ultra-large-scale devices based on wafer-scale TMDC films is still in the initial stage. There are also several major problems in the prototype device that need to be resolved. First, due to the high synthesis temperature of 2D TMDC thin films, it is difficult to directly synthesize TMDC films in situ when constructing laser diodes, light-emitting diodes, solar cells, and other heterojunction devices. The transfer needs to be used to build the device. The process will cause film damage, wrinkles and contaminants. This limits the performance and industrial application of the device. Therefore, the low-temperature synthesis of TMDC films and the damage-free transfer need to be solved urgently. MOCVD and LPCVD may achieve the low-temperature synthesis of TMDC films. These two methods are different from other CVD methods due to the precursor selection and growth mechanism. Low-temperature growth will not significantly reduce the quality and performance of the film. Also, the surface pretreatment of the substrate may achieve damage-free transfer. Second, regarding the metal/TMDC contact interface, since TMDCs have an atomic-scale thickness, the original surface is difficult to handle, so it is difficult to obtain an ohmic contact with low contact resistance. Traditional contact methods will cause gap states and Fermi level pinning, which will greatly increase contact resistance and reduce device performance. Although TMDCs have made remarkable progress in the fields of high-quality electrical contacts and high-performance devices, the contact resistance of TMDCs is still 1–3 orders of magnitude higher than that of a Si CMOS. Electronic devices based on 2D TMDCs have more research space, and the reduction of contact resistance will greatly improve the performance of the device. Third, the stability of the device is considered. Although the stability of 2D TMDCs far exceeds that of BP, the effective service life of devices based on 2D TMDCs is still very low. Hence, there is a need to explore surface modification, packaging and other means to improve the service life of the device.

Large-scale synthesis of TMDCs via a solution-based approach
This section presents the solution-based production methods for TMDC materials and discusses the mechanism in detail. In addition to highlighting the large-scale synthesis of TMDC films, we review and discuss methods to produce 1D structures of TMDCs.
Large-area 2D films
As mentioned in the previous section, CVD is widely used for the production of large-area, high-quality 2D material thin films. However, since the synthesis process is carried out at low pressure and high temperature, specific substrates are required for material growth. Moreover, continuous film growth is time-consuming, and the precise control of the film thickness over the entire wafer-scale substrate is challenging. In contrast, although receiving less attention than CVD synthesis, solution-based synthesis methods are emerging as an alternative approach due to their simplicity to scale up for mass production in a short time. Besides, solution-based methods offer a new way to achieve things that cannot be done by using the CVD method, such as synthesis inside the optical fiber capillaries, and can be applied for various types of flexible substrates, including polymer substrates.80
Chalcometalates are the most widely used precursors for TMDC thin film synthesis by thermal decomposition. In an ideal precursor, the cation lying outside the metal–chalcogen framework plays an important role, as it must decompose during the pyrolysis reaction. In addition, the molecular weight of the cation must not be too high since a high molecular weight will lead to a significant weight loss during the thermal treatment, which will cause cracks or discontinuity in the thin film. To prevent oxidation, the thermal treatment is carried out under an inert environment. The pyrolysis process involves several intermediate steps. First, the solvent and cation are removed, which results in the densification of the film. The rate of this reaction is accelerated by increasing the temperature. Next, a continuous film is generated from the amorphous inorganic state after most of the cations are removed. Finally, at a high temperature, the energy barrier decreases, and a crystalline film of the target material is formed from the amorphous film. The number of layers is determined by the initial precursor concentration. It is worth noting that high-temperature pyrolysis makes it difficult to control the film uniformity. To achieve a uniform high-quality crystalline film, a two-step process involving the formation of a homogeneous amorphous film at a low temperature and its transformation to a crystalline film at a higher temperature is performed. Li et al. first reported the large-area growth of a MoS2 film by a solution-based method.81 The substrate was dip-coated in a (NH4)2MoS4 solution and annealed at a low pressure of 1 Torr and a temperature of 500 °C. A thin film is prepared by immersing a substrate in a TMDC dispersion solution and then evaporating the solvent during the retrieval of the substrate from the solution. Therefore, the concentration of the dispersion, viscosity of the solution, the boiling point of the solvent, and pulling speed need to be considered to obtain uniform coverage of the TMDC film on the substrate. The limitation of this method is the need for a high temperature (i.e., 1000 °C) and a sulfur-rich environment in the second annealing step to improve the crystallinity and electrical performance of the MoS2 film.
Spin coating is also a commonly used method for preparing thin films on various substrates. The dispersion solution is drop cast onto a substrate that is rotated at a high speed. During the rotation of the substrate, the solution spreads over the substrate owing to centripetal force. Subsequently, the solvent is evaporated to obtain the film. Spin coating is a cost-effective and simple method for producing large-area thin films on a variety of substrates. However, material wastage is inevitable. Another limitation of this method is the inability to fabricate uniform large-area films.82,83 The liquid dewets the substrate to form islands, thus generating holes owing to spinodal decomposition when the thickness of the liquid reaches a critical value. To synthesize uniform thin films, the homogeneous coating of the precursor on the substrate without dewetting is necessary. Jeong et al. developed a highly uniform coating process involving polymer-assisted deposition followed by one-step thermolysis at 700 °C without sulfurization (Fig. 7a).84 By using linear polyethylenimine that can form a precursor–polymer complex, a highly uniform MoS2 film was synthesized on a 6-inch wafer. In this study, the choice of the polymer plays an important role. The selected polymer provides better adhesion to the substrate; thus the dewetting of the precursor is avoided. In addition, the polymer needs to be deposited at an appropriate temperature to avoid carbon residues. Moreover, the thickness of the synthesized MoS2 film could be controlled by adjusting the concentration of the precursor in the coating solution. However, it is difficult to produce monolayer MoS2 films with high crystallinity by this method.

Using the same approach, i.e., by using a polymer for uniform coating, Sankaran et al. recently produced a large-area MoS2 film by a plasma-enhanced chemical film conversion (PECFC) process (Fig. 7b).85 Similar to plasma-enhanced CVD, the authors utilized the plasma to create energetic species for the film conversion at a lower growth temperature. As a result, the MoS2 is synthesized at 500 °C and atmospheric pressure with negligible sulfur vacancies being detected. However, the plasma treatment resulted in a rough, nanostructured, and rippled film surface due to the bombardment of plasma species, and the film exhibited in-plane and out-of-plane strain. Therefore, the synthesized film is not suitable for thin-film transistors. Instead, the rippled structure could enhance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the synthesized MoS2.
Laser-induced crystallization is a well-established method in the semiconductor industry. Recently, a team led by Hong and Lee synthesized MoS2 and WS2 by this method.86 First, (NH4)2MoS4 and (NH4)2WS4 solutions were spin-coated on a SiO2/Si wafer, and then, the coated wafers were baked at 150 °C on a hot plate to completely remove the solvents. The precursors were then irradiated with a pulsed laser to allow decomposition and crystallization (Fig. 7c). By providing sufficient input energy to over the pyrolysis temperature of precursors, MoS2 and WS2 films can be obtained over a large area under ambient conditions without damage to the substrate. The thickness of the synthesized films is determined by the precursor coating step. This method allows the elimination of the patterning process after synthesis, as well as provides the direct synthesis of vertical heterojunction structures with a sharp interface even on flexible substrates such as polymers. However, the inhomogeneity of the energy density in the pulses and the rough surface caused by the overlapping exposure regions are the limitations of this method, which can degrade the electrical properties of as-grown semiconducting films. Also, the small grain size and high cost are the major obstacles to the application of the pulsed laser method into large-scale production.
Due to their strong light–matter interaction, TMDC materials have attracted attention for use in nonlinear optic and ultrafast photonic applications, especially in nonlinear optical fibers. Recently, Liu et al. reported the direct growth of MoS2 onto the internal walls of a SiO2 fiber by taking advantage of the solution method (Fig. 7d).87 The authors introduced the Mo source into the fiber holes by the capillarity of Na2MoO4 aqueous solution, followed by the sulfurization reaction at a high temperature of 820 °C. The coverage and thickness of MoS2 inside the SiO2 fibers can be tuned by controlling the concentration of Na2MoO4 solution. Although the concept is simple, the choice of precursor and solvent should be taken into account to obtain high-quality TMDCs with uniform coverage inside the fiber. This paper offers a new way to realize TMD-embedded optical fiber growth.
Furthermore, Giri et al. recently demonstrated a one-step synthesis of group VI thin films in a solution phase directly on Si substrates by a microwave-assisted crystal growth method (Fig. 7e).88 The authors dissolved the metal and chalcogen precursors in an electrolyte solution and drop cast the solution between two substrates. The sample was then placed in a microwave oven and irradiated for a short time. The conductive p++ Si wafer can absorb the majority of the incident microwaves, thus generating heat at the substrate surface. To prevent the formation of nanoparticles, the substrate temperature was maintained above the critical temperature of precursor thermolysis (Tc), while the solution temperature was maintained below Tc. In addition, by adding liquid electrolyte (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate), the convective heat transfer was facilitated to avoid the localized heating of the substrate, thus avoiding the formation of non-uniform films. Under these temperature conditions, thin films can form on the substrate surface, and the electrolyte solution can be removed by washing with a solvent. Large-area monolayer TMDC thin films can be produced by this simple process, and the film thickness can be precisely controlled by varying the precursor concentration in the electrolyte solution. However, a conducting substrate is required to obtain a uniform film with good crystallinity and a smooth surface.
From the perspective of industrial application, the roll-to-roll (R2R) method offers cost and time effectiveness for mass production. Moreover, the groundbreaking work on the R2R synthesis of 30-inch monolayer graphene on Cu has stimulated research on a wide variety of graphene-based applications.89 Recently, Lim et al. developed a novel thermal decomposition technique combined with the R2R process for the large-scale production of MoS2 films.90 In this method, the precursors are first deposited on a rollable substrate, followed by the decomposition of precursors together with the rolling process to continuously produce the TMDC film in a large area. For substrate selection, the reaction of metal foil with sulfur species should be considered. In this study, Lim et al. suggested that nickel foil is more suitable than copper foil to avoid the formation of cracks caused by the denaturation of metal foils during synthesis. In addition, the low-temperature process can reduce the chemical reaction between Ni and S. The (NH4)2MoS4 was then coated on a Ni foil, followed by two-step pyrolysis using the R2R method (Fig. 7f). The authors proposed that the absence of H2 during the desulfurization process is necessary to precisely control the stoichiometry. The uniform MoS2 film was synthesized on a 50 cm-long Ni foil, which demonstrates the capability of the R2R process for TMDC production. Moreover, in a new study, the authors developed a large-area compatible solution-based synthetic route for MoS2(1−x)Se2x ternary alloys with a customizable bichalcogen atomic ratio, thus demonstrating the potential of the 2D alloy for industrial applications such as photonic devices and catalysts for the HER.91
Solution-based synthesis is considered a highly promising method for producing nanomaterials as the growth parameters are highly controllable; however, the synthetic implementation for single-layer TMDC flakes has been challenging. Numerous studies have reported the synthesis of TMDC materials in liquid media. However, such reactions often result in the formation of hierarchical structures.92–95 As the flakes grow from the edge of the seed nuclei, the formation of seeding crystals that are a monolayer is crucial to achieving a monolayer product. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the growth conditions to ensure that TMDC nanosheet growth occurs preferentially in the in-plane direction and not in the out-of-plane direction. Cheon et al. developed a methodology for the growth of group IV, V, and VI TMDCs in liquid media.96–98 During the nucleation and growth process, the chalcogen source influx was controlled, which is a critical parameter for obtaining monolayer TMDCs with a lateral size of hundreds of nanometers. Their results indicated that, although the product grew in the lateral planes, the nucleation step was dominant, which resulted in the formation of small nanosheets. To produce large TMDC flakes, a new approach in which the nucleation step can be controlled is required. In addition, the appropriate selection of coordinating ligands is crucial, as they play an important role in controlling the morphology of the TMDC materials. Ozin et al. demonstrated that a mixture of mono- and few-layer 2H-WS2 flakes could be obtained by using oleylamine; however, the product was colloidally unstable.99 Moreover, the authors observed that by introducing oleic acid into the reaction, colloidally stable 1T-WS2 nanosheets could be achieved. Recently, Sivula et al. reported R2R TMDC film deposition to produce large-area TMDC films (Fig. 7g).100 The authors employed a liquid–liquid interface to achieve exceptional 2D nanoflake self-assembly. In this study, the TMDC flakes are first synthesized in the solution phase, followed by depositing on a rollable substrate. The needle location, rate of injection, and the moving speed of the substrate and pusher were found to be important factors for producing a uniform TMDC film. In addition, the R2R method is highly adaptable and can be used for multiple depositions, heterojunction formation, and a variety of layered materials. This method can avoid material wastage which is inevitable by using the spin coating method. The substrate roughness, adhesion between the substrate and TMDC materials, and the type of liquids should be considered in the future to further improve the R2R method.
Self-assembled wires
Over the last five years, the continued miniaturization of silicon microelectronics has provided an impetus to the information technology revolution. However, the lithography fabrication method as the technical foundation for silicon microelectronics is quickly reaching its limits. Meanwhile, the bottom-up assembly strategy that can complement the traditional top-down-based silicon semiconductors with new functions has attracted considerable research interest. Since 1D semiconductors can be used as both interconnects and device elements in nanocircuits, they have attracted considerable interest for use in the bottom-up assembly of functional electronic and optoelectronic devices. Researchers are eager to develop assembly strategies for creating well-organized nanowire arrays. To synthesize self-assembled nanowires, the solution-based coating of the TMDC precursor followed by pyrolysis is a promising approach. The processing parameters include the surface energy of the substrate, solution properties (i.e., pH, viscosity, wetting characteristics, and evaporation speed), concentration of the precursor, internal flow, and temperature. In particular, the solution viscosity and the coating process determine the target width and thickness of the nanowires. Recently, Ahn et al. demonstrated a two-step pyrolysis process for the tunable growth of TMDC nanowires.101 In this method, TMDC precursors were deposited on a substrate by dip coating. The self-assembled morphology of the product was controlled by adjusting the dip-coating process parameters such as temperature, solution pH, solvent evaporation rate, and humidity. A homogeneous (NH4)2MoS4 thin film was formed at a relatively high temperature and fast evaporation rate, whereas a dendritic structure was obtained at a relatively slow evaporation rate. Besides, the authors demonstrated the controllable formation of a uniformly spaced wire structure at a slow evaporation rate by adjusting the pH with an acidic precursor solution. The thickness of the nanowires as well as the interspaces between the wires could be controlled by the Marangoni effect by manipulating the surface tension of the solution. In addition, by using additional steps with the (NH4)2WS4 precursor on the MoS2 wires, the authors successfully produced WS2/MoS2 heterostructure wires (Fig. 8a). In a very recent study, Ahn et al. upgraded the method to create a large-scale heterostructure array.102 The authors demonstrated that WSe2 wires could be selectively stacked over MoS2 wires at a specific angle by manipulating the Marangoni flow of the solution, resulting in the formation of parallel- and cross-aligned WSe2–MoS2 heterojunctions (Fig. 8b). Their solution-based growth technique offers a novel approach for large-area optoelectronic applications.

Odom et al. first reported the solution-based synthesis of 2D nanoplates and 1D nanowires in 2005.103 In a typical reaction, NbSe2 nanostructures were formed in a one-pot reaction followed by high-temperature pyrolysis. Different morphologies could be formed by quenching the reaction at different temperatures. Nanoplates were formed when the reaction was cooled slowly, while nanowires were formed when the hot reaction was quenched rapidly (Fig. 8c). However, preferential growth in a certain direction cannot be achieved by this method. To produce large-area TMDC nanowires with highly oriented growth, Gopalan et al. developed a scalable method for synthesizing arrays of TMDC nanowires with sub-20 nm width.104 Using a poly(styrene-block-2-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P2VP) block copolymer as a thin-film template, the method can produce uniform high-density structures for the selective seeding of Mo precursors from the solution, resulting in the formation of spatially localized as-grown MoS2 nanowires (Fig. 8d). The polymer used as the template should be carefully selected to achieve uniform distribution and avoid contamination, which can deteriorate the quality of the TMDC nanowires.
Furthermore, the fabrication of 1D semiconductor materials from 2D materials is another effective strategy. Zheng et al. presented a simple approach by utilizing the intrinsic stresses of the materials, which is related to the kinetic processes of thin-film growth.105 In this work, the authors employed an ethanol solution to scroll chemical vapor deposition-grown TMDCs, creating high-quality TMDC nanoscrolls with nearly 100% yield (Fig. 8e). During the cooling step in the growth process, a strain was produced in the TMDC film because of the differences in the coefficients of thermal expansion of the film and substrate. By intercalating a liquid film such as ethanol solution between the TMDC flakes and the substrate, the thermal stresses were released, which resulted in the formation of nanoscrolls (Fig. 8f). The self-encapsulated nanoscroll structure is stable and insensitive to ambient conditions; thus, the optical and electronic properties of the materials are better than those of their 2D counterparts. The types of substrate and solution were determined as the crucial factors that can be controlled to achieve straight nanoscrolls with a high yield.
Device applications
A variety of 2D materials have tunable electronic structures, good mechanical flexibility, and high optical transparency. Also, owing to their low-temperature solution processability and tunable electronic properties, solution-based TMDC materials have attracted significant attention for various applications, especially for flexible electronic and optoelectronic devices. Ahn et al. first demonstrated a MoS2 wire-based FET array with an effective electron mobility of approximately 100 cm2 V−1 s−1, an on/off current ratio of approximately 104, and a subthreshold slope of approximately 194 mV dec−1, which are comparable to those of exfoliated MoS2 FETs (Fig. 9a).101 The solution-based synthesis method provides an effective way to produce aligned MoS2 wire, which cannot be obtained using CVD methods. In addition, the device operated stably even under distortion caused by twisting and bending, which makes it a good choice for flexible electronics. Recently, the authors improved the device performance by developing a method for fabricating self-assembled WSe2–MoS2 heterostructures. The p–n heterojunction with a clean interface exhibited high photoresponsivity with a short response time of less than 16 μs (Fig. 9b).102 The WSe2/MoS2 array-based prototype could detect not only the intensity but also the position of an external light source with a wide range of wavelengths.

OLEDs are widely used in display panels nowadays and are considered for application in future wearable displays. Research is underway to improve the performance as well as stability of OLED displays for long-term use. Zhang et al. fabricated a high-performance ultraviolet OLED using MoS2 mixed with PEDOT:PSS as the hole-injection layer (Fig. 9c).106 The addition of solution-synthesized MoS2 improved not only the conduction but also the stability of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The fabricated OLED produced short-wavelength electroluminescence at 376 nm with a radiance of 11.9 mW cm−2 and an EQE of approximately 4.14%. Moreover, the visible OLED using the MoS2 additive exhibited high efficiencies of 8.1 cd A−1 and 5.7 lm W−1. Thus, this method presents a new approach for advancing TMDC applications.
Liu et al. recently reported the concept of TMDC-embedded optical fibers; thus the authors can create the ultrafast pulsed laser. By direct growth of MoS2 onto the internal walls of a SiO2 optical fiber, the MoS2-embedded photonic crystal fibers (PCF) can be utilized instead of a traditional saturable absorber; therefore, the all-fiber mode-locked laser can be realized (Fig. 9d).87 The MoS2 PCF shows a low coupling loss of ∼1 dB and a nonlinear absorption modulation depth of 10% with a saturation peak intensity of 0.8 MW cm−2. In addition, the pulsed laser presents a maximum output power of ∼6 mW, the wavelength center at 1560 nm with a ∼500 fs pulse duration, indicating that it is ready for industrial applications.
Flexible solar cells are expected to become the next-generation power generation devices for smart wearable devices. Recently, Iwasa et al. demonstrated that by reducing the crystal symmetry of TMDC materials from a 2D film to a 1D nanotube, the bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) could be significantly enhanced.107 Thus, the photocurrent density generated by the nanotube is larger than that generated by other BPVE materials. Taking advantage of both 1D and 2D forms of TMDC materials, Zhang et al. recently fabricated a high-performance photodiode based on WSe2–MoS2 heterostructures (Fig. 9e).108 The hybrid structure contains both the MoS2 nanoscroll and WSe2 thin film, and the formed p–n junction exhibited good photovoltaic characteristics with a large open-circuit voltage of 0.18 V, photoresponsivity of 0.3 A W−1, and short response time of 5 ms. In addition, the dark current was suppressed, which led to an increase in the photocurrent-to-dark-current ratio by two orders of magnitude compared with that of the device comprising only the MoS2 nanoscroll. This demonstrates that the integration of 1D and 2D structures is promising for electronic applications.
TMDC materials have also been extensively studied for application in energy conversion and storage devices owing to their rich redox chemistry, which affords excellent electrochemical activities. Researchers have attempted to take advantage of the ternary TMDCs owing to their tunable electrical and catalytic properties. Zhang et al. fabricated a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) using FTO-coated solution-synthesized MoS2xSe2(1−x) that exhibited an open-circuit voltage of 0.75 V and a power conversion efficiency of 6.5% that are comparable to those of the DSSC comprising FTO-coated Pt (0.8 V and 7.0%, respectively) (Fig. 9f).109 The method is a new approach to the fabrication of high-performance Pt-free DSSC devices. Furthermore, the HER is a promising route to produce hydrogen as a high-power-density fuel. Among TMDCs, 2H-phase MoS2 has received significant attention for use in the HER as the MoS2 edge exhibits a higher HER activity than the basal planes. Most of the TMDCs are stable in the 2H phase; thus the solution-based synthesis process provides an effective method to obtain the 1T phase, which is a challenge using CVD methods. It is noteworthy that because of increased conductivity, 1T-MoS2 is more catalytically active in the HER than 2H-MoS2. Zhang et al. developed a facile approach for the large-scale production of MoSxSe1−x with a high fraction of the 1T phase for the HER.110 Importantly, the solution-synthesized MoSxSe1−x exhibited an enhanced HER performance with a Tafel slope of 40 mV dec−1, which is close to that of Pt (28 mV dec−1) (Fig. 9g). In addition, the ternary MoSxSe1−x exhibited a low overpotential of −140 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and excellent long-term durability.
Conclusions
In recent years, a considerable amount of research has been conducted to realize large-area monolayer TMDC films. TMDC films have shown great potential in manufacturing electronic and optoelectronic devices. However, their quality fails to meet the standard required for practical applications. Further advances are necessary to improve material characteristics and the fabrication process of devices. Despite the improvement in the synthesis of 2D materials on a large scale, exfoliated samples using Scotch tape are still preferred for fundamental research, where high-end properties are required. Thus, synthesis methods for producing defect-free and high-purity materials in a large-area need to be developed to realize practical applications. Moreover, the nucleation density needs to be controlled in future studies to reduce the number of grain boundaries, which is one of the most critical factors affecting the electrical properties of the materials. Notably, more effort is required to develop methods that promote the epitaxial growth of wafer-scale single-crystal TMDC films with a controllable number of layers. Consequently, the understanding of substrates such as surface structure, defects, thermal strain, and the surface charge is required, and a variety of growth substrate needs to be examined. The growth of large-area lateral and vertical TMDC heterostructures is the next step in this research direction. However, the fundamental issues related to heteroepitaxial growth need to be addressed. For example, since the first layer serves as a substrate for the growth of the second layer, the properties of the underlying layer, including grain boundaries, defects, and strain, will affect the growth of the second layer in terms of precursor adsorption, nucleation, domain orientation, and lateral or vertical growth. Furthermore, reproducibility, uniform property distribution, and up-scaling remain the challenging issues that need to be resolved. Finally, a deeper understanding of material properties depending on the atomic structure is required to design materials for specific applications.
