    , Accepted 22nd August 2019First published on 22nd August 2019AbstractIn an effort to diminish the cost of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with regard to hole transport materials (HTMs), we employed an easily attainable condensation route to synthesize a cheap and efficient HTM. Using a newly engineered small organic molecule, N,N′-(naphthalene-1,5-diyl)bis(1-(2,3-diphenylquinoxalin-6-yl)-1-phenylmethanimine), coded as BEDN, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) reached 17.85%, comparable to that of the state-of-the-art HTM spiro-OMeTAD (19.50%). The BEDN's estimated cost is 1.38 ($ per g), which is considerably cheaper than spiro-OMeTAD, 92 ($ per g). The low cost and high efficiency are promising in commercialization of perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
The rapid development of organic/inorganic metal-halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has amazed the solar cell research community.1,2 Only after seven years from the beginning, more than ten thousand researchers are currently involved in PSC progress, worldwide.3 The rapid growth of efficiency, from about 3.8%4 to a phenomenal value of 24.2%,5 in just a few years from the discovery of the first perovskite nanocrystals as a light absorber in DSSCs in 2009,4 has turned this field into a “gold rush”.6 PSCs have the potential to operate efficiently for widespread deployment, but several obstacles still exist. Firstly, achieving a reliable judgment about long-term stability under extensive light exposure at a temperature of 60 °C is seemingly a challenging step.7–12 In recent years, a number of strategies and protocols have been reported to address this issue in the near future.13 Secondly, the environmental issues with the materials at the heart of PSCs, namely lead metal, cannot be neglected.14 Hence, a fundamental understanding of the mechanism of degradation and composition of employed materials could be useful to achieve novel formulations and materials with reduced cost and higher efficiencies.15–17 The essential requirement to fabricate an efficient device is to minimize the charge recombination losses and to control the trapping phenomena at the perovskite/hole transport material (HTM) interface.18,19 Accordingly, the discovery of new HTMs to employ in optoelectronic devices is still an open issue, and an enormous improvement on the efficiency is achieved by identifying novel HTMs including polymers, small organic molecules, and inorganic materials.20 In this paradigm, small organic molecules have remarkable advantages such as a facile synthesis process with high yield and purity, which is of great interest for industrial production.21 The most well-known organic-HTM in PSCs is spiro-OMeTAD, which has recorded a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) in the early days of PSC research.22 However, the big problem to the commercialization of spiro-OMeTAD is its costly synthesis process with costly sublimation steps for purification. In particular, six difficult steps of synthesis and purification are needed to obtain pure spiro-OMeTAD along with a high cost Pd catalyst under inert atmosphere conditions.23–26 The total estimated material cost for 1 gram of spiro-OMeTAD is about 92$. Moreover, the total estimated chemical waste for the synthesis of 1 gram of spiro-OMeTAD is 3.6 (kg g−1). Finally, the commercial price for 1 gram of spiro-OMeTAD reaches 170–425$.26,27 Besides the high price of spiro-OMeTAD, its stability in PSCs is the main limitation for its commercialization.
The main strategy to synthesize small molecule HTMs is employing palladium-catalyzed C–N cross-coupling using an expensive catalyst such as Pd/BINAP.28–30 Therefore, the actual promising way to reduce the cost of the reaction pathway is replacing the Pd catalyst with a cheap and efficient catalyst or completely removing it. Interestingly, a large number of condensation methods do not need to use any catalyst or harsh conditions.31,32 Newly synthesized HTM based on the condensation procedure is less prone to undesirable side reactions which is seen in the corresponding catalyst based reactions due to diminished yields or catalyst deactivation, leading to achieving a high product yield (>80%). Therefore, the specific property of newly synthesized HTMs based on condensation methods is the simplified synthesis process compared to other HTMs, which are known to date.
Despite the development of several newly synthesized small organic HTMs based on C–N cross coupling for PSC application,20 the finding of new strategies to facilitate synthesis pathways needs more efforts. Herein, we introduce an exceedingly cheap PSC device using a new HTM based on sequential condensation of the phenanthrene ligand. Only two sequent ketone–amine condensations without adding any catalyst or additive under mild conditions were carried out to obtain BEDN with high purity and product yield.
Results and discussion
The synthetic routes to BEDN are shown in Scheme 1. The total yield of BEDN is about 60%, which was prepared by a straightforward two-step condensation synthesis. BEDN was purified by recrystallization and characterization (1H NMR, see the ESI, Fig. S1 and S2†).

To get more insight about the activity of the newly investigated HTM, we compared the differences and similarities in all photophysical, photochemical and photoelectrochemical properties of BEDN with a reference spiro-OMeTAD. The UV-Vis spectra of the newly synthesized HTM exhibit relatively similar absorption peaks to spiro-OMeTAD as summarized in Table 1.

The inset of Fig. 1a depicts the absorption bands of BEDN and spiro-OMeTAD in the visible region, which shows that the ε of BEDN is smaller than that of corresponding spiro-OMeTAD.33 The photoluminescence (PL) of BEDN and spiro-OMeTAD recorded in chloroform shows a strong band at 427 and a shoulder at 575 nm, while spiro-OMeTAD exhibited only one emission band at 421 nm, which is in agreement with earlier references.34 The electrochemical behaviors of BEDN and spiro-OMeTAD were investigated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and BEDN exhibited quasi-reversible oxidation/reduction processes in the positive potential range (Fig. 1b). The first oxidation half-wave of BEDN was observed at 0.58 V vs. Ag/AgCl which is 0.02 V lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD, confirming that BEDN is more easily oxidized to BEDN+ than spiro-OMeTAD to spiro-OMeTAD+.35 UV-Vis, PL and CV spectra were employed to estimate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and band gap of the newly investigated HTM, and are summarized in Table 1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements indicated that BEDN has a higher (136 °C) glass transition temperature (Tg) than spiro-OMeTAD (Tg = 125 °C; Fig. 1c),14 which confirms a higher thermal stability of BEDN with respect to spiro. DSC also proved that BEDN starts to crystallize at 164 °C and spiro-OMeTAD at 158 °C, which are both far above temperatures for conventional device operation. To examine the hydrophobic properties of BEDN, the water contact angle measurement was carried out (Fig. 1d). The water contact angle for BEDN coated films was 83.2°, as shown in Fig. 1d. This result indicates that the new HTM presents a good hydrophobicity and can be used as a suitable HTM in PSCs. This means that the new HTM prevents water penetration to the perovskite surface below the HTM, and thus does not destroy the perovskite, which is highly sensitive to moisture. To address the film forming ability and distribution of the new HTM on the surface, FE-SEM results of glass/BEDN and glass/TiO2/BEDN were compared to those of spiro-OMeTAD which showed that there is no pin-hole or defect on the coated layers (ESI, Fig. S3–S5†).

The newly investigated small-molecule BEDN was tested as a HTM in solution-processed PSC devices. A stack of thin layers was prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass that serves as the backbone of the device. The device was made with the standard configuration including the TiO2-blocking layer/TiO2-mesoporous layer as the electron-transporting layer (ETM)/perovskite absorber ((FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15) and the newly engineered molecule as the HTM.36 The solubility of BEDN in chlorobenzene (CB) is very good which supports the uniformity of the deposited HTM layer. To enhance the conductivity of cells, a small amount of dopants was used in both cases, BEDN and spiro-OMeTAD. For a purposeful comparison, solar cells with the spiro-OMeTAD based HTM and without any HTM were also fabricated.
The schematic illustration and the cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images are shown in Fig. 2 (the different layers can be seen from Fig. 2b). The plot of current density against the applied voltage (J–V) for PSC devices is shown in Fig. 3a and the obtained data are summarized in Table 2. Obviously, all photovoltaic performances of PSC devices based on the molecularly engineered HTM are significantly improved compared to the PSC without the HTM, confirming the effective role of BEDN in the device. On the other hand, BEDN-based device exhibited JSC of 20.64 mA cm−2 and VOC of 1.03 V and PCE of 17.85%, which are close to spiro-OMeTAD with JSC of 22.16 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.10 V and consequently PCE of 19.50%.

These results are particularly interesting since the PCE of the PSC based on BEDN was almost doubled compared to the PSC without the HTM (ESI, Fig. S6, Table S1†).
In order to investigate the reproducibility of PSCs based on BEDN, at least 15 individual devices were fabricated using BEDN and spiro-OMeTAD. Statistical distribution of the device performances is shown in Fig. 6. The average performances of PSCs based on BEDN and spiro-OMeTAD are 16.05% and 17.60%, respectively. The general trend in PCE for both BEDN and spiro-OMeTAD was the same as the maximum value ones. The hysteresis parameter of both BEDN and spiro-OMeTAD was investigated by recording forward and reverse scanning of current against the applied voltage (Fig. 3a). The results showed that the forward scanning mode is slightly lower than reverse ones, indicating the hysteresis phenomenon, which is about less than 1% in both samples.

Fig. 3b shows the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the PSCs based on BEDN and spiro-OMeTAD as a function of wavelength, indicating good agreement between the JSC obtained from the IPCE and J–V measurement. Obviously, the IPCE from the BEDN HTM is similar to that of spiro-OMeTAD, reaching above 85% conversion. However, as shown in the IPCE spectra, there is a loss in photon conversion in the range of 550–750 nm for the BEDN, which is not the case for spiro-OMeTAD. We attribute this loss to the existence of traps and recombination sites at the perovskite/HTL interface, compared to spiro-OMeTAD.37
After observing the J–V and IPCE spectra, we hypothesized that perhaps the reason for the difference in the photovoltaic performance was due to inefficient hole transport.19 To test this behavior, the dynamics of hole transfer from the perovskite to the HTM was investigated by employing steady state PL of the TiO2/perovskite and TiO2/perovskite/HTM. As shown in Fig. 4a, the samples have shown a PL peak at 760 nm originating from the perovskite (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15. When a BEDN is cast onto the perovskite layer, the perovskite PL quantum yield of the perovskite/BEDN film significantly decreased with respect to the bare perovskite film.

Compared with the spiro-OMeTAD based cell, which acquires a PL quenching efficiency (ηquench) of 0.89, the BEDN-based cell records a substantially higher ηquench of 0.94 (by 11%). The origin of the quenching of the PL spectrum of perovskite/BEDN can be attributed to charge carrier extraction across the interface between BEDN and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15.25 For a deeper understanding of the charge transfer dynamics in the newly investigated HTM, time resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy (TRPS) was also performed. A bi-exponential decay function was employed to fit the lifetime of the perovskite/HTM because the TRPS showed a non-exponential decay. The value of τ2 of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15, BEDN/(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 and spiro-OMeTAD/(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 is 16.20, 10.15 and 9.95 ns, respectively. From the results of steady-state PL and TRPS, the difference of charge separation ability in BEDN and spiro-OMeTAD is quite small.36 The electronic structures of the spiro-OMeTAD and BEDN HTMs calculated by density functional theory (DFT) are shown in Fig. 5. As seen in the figure, the HOMO and LUMO of BEDN are separately localized on the naphthalene core and the 3,4-diaminobenzophenone (DPDA) moieties, respectively. The BEDN HOMO is stabilized slightly compared to spiro-OMeTAD, which can be seen in their oxidation potential. The higher calculated oxidation potential for BEDN (0.1 eV) relative to spiro-OMeTAD (0.03 eV) indicates that higher energy is required to oxidize the molecule. This higher potential in BEDN is probably due to the lack of repulsive interactions between the two molecular halves in spiro-OMeTAD.33 Although the PCE of the BEDN HTM is not higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD, the comparable efficiency still supports the fact that the BEDN is a promising HTM for PSCs.

Charge transport properties represent another important parameter to consider in the design of new HTMs in PSCs. The hole mobility values of the pristine HTMs were measured by a space-charge limited current (SCLC) method according to the literature12,38–41 (ESI, Fig. S7 and S8†) and the data are listed in Table 1. The mobility of spiro-OMeTAD is similar to the data reported in the literature, indicating the reliability of the SCLC technique.42,43 The extracted hole mobility for pristine BEDN is 9.08 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is almost five times higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD (4.10 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). The high hole mobility and PCE of this newly engineered molecule make it a good candidate to work in PSCs. The conductivity of pristine BEDN is also slightly higher than that of pristine spiro-OMeTAD (Table 1). The conductivity of BEDN after addition of the additive was 1.2 × 10−4 S cm−1. The PSC based on dopant-free BEDN presented better performance in comparison with dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD (ESI, Fig. S6, Table S1†). However, in spite of obtaining high conductivity and hole mobility for BEDN without additives, spiro-OMeTAD showed a slightly better performance after the addition of LiTFSI and t-BP additives.
Furthermore, the durability of photovoltaic performances of devices based on BEDN and spiro-OMeTAD was further probed under standard conditions (Fig. 7). The performances of devices based on the two HTMs decreased very slowly in 500 h. After this time, BEDN and spiro-OMeTAD based devices retained 93% and 90% of the initial PCEs.

Table 3 shows that the price of the newly engineered HTM is much lower than spiro-OMeTAD23–26 (please see ESI, Table S2 for more details†).

Conclusion
In summary, to achieve a low cost HTM for use in efficient PSCs, we successfully replaced the palladium-catalyzed C–N coupling pathway with a simple sequential condensation route. Surprisingly, this newly designed pathway included only two steps without any purification, harsh conditions and catalyst. In particular, the PCE of PSCs based on the molecularly engineered HTM is comparable with that of benchmark spiro-OMeTAD, resulting in 17.85 and 19.50%, respectively.
Experimental
All starting materials were purchased from Aldrich Chemical and Merck Companies and used without further purification. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Advance 250 MHz spectrometers with CDCl3 and D6-DMSO as solvent. Chemical shifts were calibrated against TMS as an internal standard. UV/Vis and emission spectra were recorded using an Ultrospec 3100 pro spectrophotometer and AvaSpec-125 spectrophotometer in CHCl3 solution. Eo–o was obtained using the intersection of absorption and emission spectra. The electrochemical studies were accomplished by using a SAMA500 potentiostat electrochemical analyzer with a conventional three electrode cell, a Pt disk as the working electrode, and a Pt wire as the counter electrode. Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode and the supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M TBAP in chloroform. The J–V curves were recorded using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) with a source meter (Keithley 2420) under 100 mA cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5 G) and a calibrated Si-reference cell certified by NREL. The J–V curves of all devices were measured by masking the active area with a metal mask of area 0.096 cm2.
Synthesis of N,N′-(naphthalene-1,5-diyl)bis(1-(2,3-diphenylquinoxalin-6-yl)-1-phenylmethanimine) (BEDN)
The synthesis of the newly investigated HTM is based on simple condensation between carbonyl and amine moieties without any future column chromatography. First, the BED precursor was prepared from the condensation of benzil (420 mg, 2 mmol) with DPDA (424 mg, 2 mmol) in the mixture of 50 ml ethanol and 2 ml of acetic acid. The mixture was refluxed for 4 h and then the yellow solid precipitate was filtered and washed with cold ethanol to remove the unreacted ligands. Then, the pure BED precursor was achieved through the crystallization of the product in ethanol (700 mg, 90%). Analysis data: 1H NMR (250 MHz, CDCl3), 8.53 (s, 1H), 8.28 (s, 2H), 7.89–7.92 (d, 2H), 7.26–7.64 (m, 13H). 13C NMR (250 MHz, CDCl3), 195 (CO), 155, 154, 138, 132.81, 132.45, 130, 129.88, 129.86, 129.76, 129.16, 128.51, 128.37.
Finally, condensation between synthesized BED (386 mg, 1 mmol) and diamine naphthalene (78 mg, 0.5 mmol) in acetic acid for 12 h produced the yellow BEDN precipitate. After washing and re-crystallization in acetic acid, pure BEDN was achieved (285 mg, 60%). Analysis data: 1H NMR (250 MHz, CDCl3), 8.30 (d, 1H), 8.26 (s, 1H), 8.17 (d, 1H), 7.81–7.84 (d, 3H), 7.71 (t, 2H), 7.58–7.61 (m, 2H), 7.43–7.46 (m, 4H), 7.34–7.36 (m, 4H). 13C NMR (250 MHz, CDCl3), 195.43, 155.28, 154.73, 142.56, 139.89, 138.78, 138.38, 137.07, 133.56, 131.77, 130.19, 130.10, 129.88, 129.65, 129.52, 129.17, 128.55.

Fabrication of cells
Perovskite solar cells were fabricated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates. Part of the glass substrate coated with FTO was etched with Zn powder and HCl 2 M ethanol solution. Then, the substrates were washed carefully with distilled water, detergent, acetone, ethanol, and isopropanol and then treated with an ultraviolet/O3 cleaner for 15 min. On these substrates, a solution of HCl and titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in anhydrous ethanol was coated with a spin-coating method at 2000 r.p.m. for 30 s. Then, the substrates were heated at 500 °C for 30 minutes and cooled down to room temperature. A mesoporous TiO2 layer diluted in ethanol was deposited by spin-coating at 2000 r.p.m. for 10 s to achieve a 300–400 nm thick layer. After that, the substrates were sintered again at 500 °C for 30 minutes. The PbI2 solution was coated on the mesoporous TiO2 layer for 5 s at 6500 r.p.m. and dried at 70 °C. The mixed perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving PbI2 (1.15 M), FAI (1.10 M), PbBr2 (0.2 M), and MABr (0.2 M) in an anhydrous solvent DMF:DMSO = 4:1 (volume ratio). The perovskite solution was spin-coated in a two-step procedure at 1000 and 6000 r.p.m. for 10 and 30 s respectively. Chlorobenzene (110 μl) was dropped onto the spinning substrate at 20 s in the second step and then the films were annealed at 100 °C for 90 min in a glove box. Following this step, the BEDN and spiro-OMeTAD were deposited by spin-coating at 4000 r.p.m. for 20 s. The HTM solutions were prepared by dissolving the HTM in chlorobenzene at a concentration of 78 mM, with the addition of 18 μL LiTFSI (from a stock solution in acetonitrile with a concentration of 1.0 M), 29 μL of tert-butyl pyridine (from a stock solution in chlorobenzene with a concentration of 1.0 M). Finally, an 80 nm Au electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation under high vacuum.33,44
Computational method details
The ground-state geometries were fully optimized using density functional theory (DFT) with the B3LYP hybrid functional at the basis set level of 6-31G*, and the frontier molecular orbitals were drawn using an isovalue of 0.03 a.u. All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package in the PowerLeader workstation. The molecular orbitals were visualized using Gauss View 5.0.8.
PL quenching efficiency
PL quenching efficiency was calculated using the following formula:  where PLbare and PLquench are integrated PL intensities of the perovskite on sapphire substrates without and with the quenching HTM layer.
Synthesis cost estimation of 1 gram BEDN
We estimated the synthesis cost of 1 gram BEDN according to the cost models of Petrus et al.24 and Osedach et al.23 The price of the materials used has been obtained from Merck, Sigma Aldrich, and DeJong companies. We compared the price of 1 gram of this new HTM with the price of 1 gram of spiro-OMeTAD, which is reported in the literature (please see the ESI, Table S1†).33,45
Conductivity measurements
Glass substrates without the conductive layer were cleaned carefully with detergents, deionized water, acetone and ethanol, respectively. Then to remove remaining organic residues, the substrates were sintered at 500 °C. A thin layer of nanoporous TiO2 was coated on glass substrates by spin-coating with a diluted TiO2 paste (PST-20T) with ethanol (1:3, mass ratio). After that, the TiO2 film was sintered in an oven at 500 °C. Then a solution of HTM in chlorobenzene (concentrations similar to those in photovoltaic devices) was deposited by spin-coating on the TiO2 layer. Finally, an Au layer was deposited on top of the HTM layer by thermal evaporation.
