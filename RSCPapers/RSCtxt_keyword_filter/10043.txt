    , Accepted 7th December 2013First published on 28th January 2014AbstractA feasible synthesis of 10,11-di(3,7-dimethyloctyloxy)dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]naphtho[1,2-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (NDT) was presented, and a novel low band gap (LBG) NDT-based polymer was prepared and characterized. The preliminary results indicate that NDT can be used as a novel electron-rich building block in the development of LBG conjugated polymers.
Since the discovery of the ultrafast photo-induced charge transfer between conjugated polymers (CPs) and fullerenes,1 the polymer bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells (PVCs) have attracted much attention due to the potential application for large-area, flexible, and low-cost solar cells.2 Tremendous effort such as the development of novel LBG CPs,3–8 the optimization of the fabricating process9 and modifying the morphology of the donor and acceptor blend etc.,10 has been devoted to improve the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PVCs. Among them, the development of high performance donor–acceptor (D–A) type LBG CPs has been demonstrated to be the most vigorous approach to achieve efficient PVCs, and many promising D–A type LBG CPs have been developed in recent decades.3–8 The most attractive sample is benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT)-based CPs.7,8 For instance, Hou and Yang et al. have demonstrated a series of LBG CPs based on BDT, and PCEs of 5.63–8.4% have been achieved in PVCs.8 Huang and co-workers have reported a new and interesting BDT-based polymer (PBDT-DTNT) with naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole as the new electron accepting building block exhibiting high PCEs up to 8.4%.7d,e
More recently, it has been demonstrated that polycyclic thienoacenes with larger coplanar cores and more extended conjugation length not only provided advantages such as enhanced charge-carrier mobilities and decreased band gaps, but also were believed to provide facile exciton separation into free charge carriers of the corresponding CPs.11–15 For example, Yu and co-workers reported a series of CPs based on tetrathienoanthracene derivatives in 2009. Compared to CPs based on BDT derivatives, the π–π distances between the backbone of tetrathienoanthracene-based CPs were decreased, and the PCEs and hole mobilities of the devices from the tetrathienoanthracene-based CPs were remarkably increased.13 Recently, Hou et al. reported a CP based on 5,10-di(2-hexyldecyloxy)dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo-[1,2b:4,5-b′]dithiophene,14 and Yu et al. presented a series of CPs based on 5,10-di(2-butylhexyl)dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (DTBDTs).15 PCEs of 3.6–7.4% have been achieved in PVCs from CPs.14,15 Alongside this, novel thienoacene derivatives such as naphtho[1,2-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (NT),16 anthradithiophene,17 indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene,18 and benzotrithiophene,19 have also been developed and used as electron-rich building blocks for high performance LBG CPs in recent years.
In this communication, a novel hexacyclic thienoacene derivative 10,11-di(3,7-dimethyloctyloxy)dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]naphtho[1,2-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (NDT), was synthesized for the first time and the optoelectronic properties investigated. The new D–A type LBG CP named as PNDT-BT, with NDT electron donor units and 5,6-di(dodecyloxy)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole electron acceptor units, was also prepared, and photovoltaic properties of the polymer were provided.
NDT was synthesized following the procedure as shown in Scheme 1. Compounds II,3III20, IV20 and V20 were prepared via procedures described in the references (see ESI†). Compound VI was synthesized though the Suzuki coupling reaction between 4,5-dibromo-1,2-di(3,7-dimethyloctyloxy)benzene (IV) and 3-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (V), with a yield of 96%. Subsequently, cyclization of compound VI was performed through FeCl3 in acetonitrile at ambient temperature to form 10,11-di(3,7-dimethyloctyloxy)dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]naphtho[1,2-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (NDT) with a yield of 86%. 2,7-Bis(trimethylstannyl)-10,11-di(3,7-dimethyloctyloxy)dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]naphtho[1,2-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (VII) was synthesized by the following procedure: NDT was reacted with n-BuLi in anhydrous THF at 0 °C, then the solution of trimethylstannyl chloride was added in one portion to give VII with a yield of 96%. The chemical structures of all novel compounds were confirmed by 1H NMR and elemental analysis data (see ESI†).
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route of NDT. 
The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of NDT exhibits three absorption peaks at around 280 nm, 354 nm and 374 nm in dichloromethane (DCM) solution (see ESI, Fig. S1a†). The onset wavelength for NDT is around 390 nm, which corresponds to the optical band gap of 3.1 eV. The first oxidation potential of NDT determined by CV is around 0.90 V (see ESI, Fig. S1b†), which corresponds to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of −5.20 eV under the premise that the energy level of FeCp2+/0 is 4.8 eV below the vacuum level.21 Interestingly, although the band gap of NDT is narrower than that of its aromatic analogue thienoacene derivative 5,6-di(3,7-dimethyloctyloxy)naphtho[1,2-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (NT-C12), the HOMO energy level of NDT is similar to that of NDT-C12 (−5.20 eV vs. −5.25 eV) (Fig. S1 and S2†). It should also be noted that NDT has a similar HOMO energy level to BDT (−5.19 eV) and DTBDTs (−5.16 eV). On the other hand, because NDT, BDT, NT and DTBDT are respectively hexacyclic, tricyclic, tetracyclic and pentacyclic molecules, the coplanar area and/or conjugation length of the NDT core should be larger than that of NT, BDT and DTBDT. These results indicate that NDT could be used as a potential candidate for notable thienoacene derivatives such as BDT, NT and DTBDT in the development of D–A type LBG CPs.7,8,13–16
To verify the concept of NDT as an electron-rich building block for D–A type LBG CPs, the copolymer named PNDT-BT, with NDT as electron donor units and 5,6-di(dodecyloxy)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole as electron acceptor units, was prepared by the Stille coupling reaction under mono-microwave heating conditions (Scheme 2). The number-average molecular weight of PNDT-BT determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using a polystyrene standard is about 19.6 kDa with a polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) of 1.62. The PNDT-BT shows better solubility in common organic solvents, and exhibits good thermal stability with a 5% weight loss temperature (Td) at temperatures higher than 360 °C under nitrogen flow (see ESI, Fig. S3†).
 Scheme 2  Synthetic route of monomers and PNDT-BT. 
The UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra of PNDT-BT are shown in Fig 1. PNDT-BT exhibits two absorption peaks at 411 nm and 586 nm with a shoulder peak at 652 nm in chloroform solution. The absorption intensities of peaks at 410 nm and 652 nm for PNDT-BT are increased, and the onset band gap wavelength of the CP is redshifted about 14 nm from the solution to film (Fig 1). The optical band gaps of PNDT-BT in the solid thin film and chloroform solution estimated from the onset band gap wavelengths are 1.71 eV and 1.74 eV (Fig. S4†), respectively. The onset oxidation and reduction potentials of PNDT-BT versus FeCp2+/0 (half wave potential of 0.5 eV (ref. 8a)) determined by CV, are 0.36 V and −1.33 V, respectively (see ESI, Fig. S4†). Accounting for the absolute energy level of FeCp2+/0 being −4.8 eV below the vacuum level,21 the HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of PNDT-BT calculated by empirical formulas (EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.8) (eV) and ELUMO = −(Ered + 4.8) (eV)) are −5.16 eV and −3.47 eV, respectively. The electrochemical band gap of 1.69 eV for PNDT-BT is similar to the optical band gap of 1.71 eV for PNDT-BT in a solid thin film.
 Fig. 1  Normalized absorption and photoluminescence spectra of PNDT-BT. 
To investigate the influence of extended coplanar core and conjugation length of thienoacene derivative units on the hole mobility of the related CPs, an alternating CP, PNT-BT, with NT-C12 (aromatic analogue thienoacene derivative of NDT) as the electron donor unit and 5,6-di(dodecyloxy)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole as the electron acceptor unit, was also prepared (see ESI, Scheme S1†). The hole mobilities of PNDT-BT and PNT-BT were determined by applying the space-charge limited current (SCLC) model.8b The hole mobilities were found to be 1.01 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.1 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PNDT-BT and PNT-BT, respectively (see ESI, Fig. S5 and Table S1†). Because PNDT-BT and PNT-BT have similar molecular weights and side alkyl chains, the higher hole mobility of PNDT-BT is probably due to the larger coplanar core area and extended conjugation of NDT.
PNDT-BT, as the electron donor material for PVCs, was first employed in a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al, with the [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as the electron acceptor material. The blending weight ratios of PNDT-BT and PC61BM were optimized from 1:1 to 1:3. The fabricated PVCs were tested under AM 1.5 G illumination at an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The J–V characteristics of the PVCs from the PNDT-BT and PC61BM blend film are presented in Fig 2. PCEs of 1.36–2.29% with open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.64–0.65 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 2.83–5.27 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 53.0–60.0% were achieved in PVCs based on the blend of PNDT-BT/PC61BM, and the devices with a blending weight ratio of 1:2 of PNDT-BT/PC61BM showed the best performance. As compared with the devices based on PNT-BT and PC61BM with the weight ratio of 1:2 (Fig. S6†), both the Voc (0.65 V vs. 0.68 V) and Jsc (5.27 mA cm−2vs. 5.07 mA cm−2) of devices based on PNDT-BT/PC61BM (W:W, 1:2) were slightly decreased. When the [6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) and/or indene-C60 bis-adduct (IC60BA) were used as electron acceptor materials instead of PC61BM, the PCEs of PVCs based on the blend of PNDT-BT/PC71BM and PNDT-BT/IC60BA were increased to 3.90% and 4.49%, respectively (Fig 2). The improvements of Jsc of the devices from PC71BM/PNDT-BT may be due to stronger absorption of PC71BM in the visible region compared to PC61BM. The improvements of Voc for PVCs from PNDT-BT/IC60BA might be due to the higher LUMO of IC60BA (LUMOPC61BM/PC71BM = −3.9 eV, LUMOIC60BA = −3.76 eV).22,23

J–V characteristics of the PVCs based on PNDT-BT. 
PVCs based on the blend of PNDT-BT/PC61BM exhibited a photoresponse in the range of 300–760 nm with an incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) range of 2–28% (see ESI, Fig. S7†). The IPCEs of devices based on the blend of PNDT-BT/PC71BM and PNDT-BT/IC60BA exhibited similar photoresponse properties, but were slightly increased compared to the PNDT-BT/PC61BM based PVCs (see ESI, Fig. S7†).
Conclusions
In conclusion, a feasible synthesis of 10,11-di(3,7-dimethyloctyloxy)dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]naphtho[1,2-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (NDT) was presented. The optoelectronic properties of NDT were investigated by UV-Vis absorption spectra and cyclic voltammetry. The newly alternating D–A type LBG conjugated copolymer with 5,6-di(dodecyloxy)benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole as the electron acceptor moieties and NDT as the electron donor moieties, has also been prepared. The photovoltaic properties of the resulting copolymer were studied, and the power conversion efficiencies of 1.36–4.49% were achieved in the bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells based on the blend of the PNDT-BT and fullerene derivatives under 100 mA cm−2 illumination (AM 1.5 G). The preliminary results indicated that the NDT unit can be used as a novel electron-rich building block in the development of a new D–A type LBG conjugated polymer for polymer photovoltaic cells.
