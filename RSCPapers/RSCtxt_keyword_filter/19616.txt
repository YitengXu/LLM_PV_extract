, Accepted 21st July 2014First published on 22nd July 2014AbstractWe reported a facile fabrication of three dimensional (3D) branched ZnO–TiO2 heterojunction nanorod arrays using a two-step hydrothermal method. This process included the vertical growth of TiO2 nanorod arrays on FTO substrates as backbones and then the facile solution growth of branched ZnO nanorods on the rutile trunks. After being decorated by CdS quantum dots (QDs), the branched ZnO–TiO2 heterojunction nanorod arrays were used as photoanodes in quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs). Compared to the bare TiO2 nanorod arrays, the branched ZnO–TiO2 heterojunction nanorod arrays provided a higher surface area for QD loading and better light scattering arising from ZnO nanorod branches. In the meantime, the heterojunction formed at the TiO2–ZnO interface facilitated the electron transfer and reduced the recombination reactions of electrons with electrolyte-oxidized species. As a result, we got a conversion efficiency of 0.73% with the thickness of only 1 μm, which showed a 55% improvement over the QDSCs that used bare TiO2 nanorod arrays as photoanode.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention from researchers due to their low cost and easy fabrication during the past two decades since they were first reported in 1991.1 DSSCs based on a nanocrystalline TiO2 film as photoelectrode have reached an efficiency level exceeding 12% recently.2 As an alternative, quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have received extensive research interest in recent years owing to the significant advantages of quantum dots (QDs) such as tunable band gap, high extinction coefficients and multiple excitons generation effect.3–5 However, in spite of these potential advantages, the conversion efficiency of QDSCs has only reached 5% so far, unsatisfactory in comparison to conventional DSSCs. At present, many strategies have been conducted to improve the cell performance of QDSCs, including how to enhance the light harvesting of QDs on the photoanode, the collection efficiency of photo-generated electrons as well as how to restrain recombination reactions.
Transport and recombination of electrons are major determinations of the overall efficiency of solar cells. One-dimensional (1D) nanostructures, especially vertically aligned nanowires/nanorods or nanotubes on top of a substrate, can facilitate electron transport and reduce the charge recombination by providing a direct conduction pathway for the photo-generated electrons.6–8 ZnO nanowires/nanorods have been widely investigated in QDSCs for their superior electronic transport performance. Zhang et al. have first used ZnO nanowires as photoanodes in CdS QDSCs and got overall power conversion efficiency of 0.34%.9 Recently, considerable efforts have been devoted to the synthesis of vertically aligned single-crystalline TiO2 nanostructures and the QD sensitization for photovoltaic devices. Chen et al. have successfully prepared CdS QDs sensitized TiO2 nanorod arrays electrodes and achieved a maximum photocurrent of 2.5 mA cm−2 under AM 1.5 G illuminations.10 But the photovoltaic performance of 1D nanostructure is not high, which is related to their insufficient surface area and considerable free space with poor light harvesting. To overcome the disadvantage, constructing hierarchical morphologies based on 1D structures turns out to be an effective way as the hierarchical structure could enhance the QD loading and maintain the fast electron transport at the same time.
Another point to degrade the efficiency in QDSCs is the charge recombination process between photoinjected electrons and redox ions of the electrolyte. As is known, a core shell structure that TiO2 are coated by another higher conduction band metal oxide semiconductor (ZnO, Nb2O5, Al2O3, MgO, etc.) could form an energy barrier to facilitate the charge separation and to reduce the electron recombination.11–14 Among them, ZnO is an excellent coating material to modify TiO2 due to their similar energy band structure,15 higher electron mobility,16 and a lower photo inactivation17 in comparison of TiO2. Chen et al. have fabricated TiO2 nanotubes with ZnO layer for CdS QDSCs and found that the thin ZnO coating enhanced the power conversion efficiency by 43.7% owing to the improved charge-collecting efficiency and reduced recombination.18 Recently, hierarchical TiO2–ZnO nanostructures have been prepared by assembling ZnO nanorods or nanowires on the core of TiO2 in order to further improve the light harvesting. The TiO2 inverse opal/ZnO nanowire hybrid nanostructure has been used in QDs based photoelectrochemical cells and showed excellent photocurrent density.19 Wang et al. and Athauda et al. have prepared three-dimensional ZnO–TiO2 hierarchical structures with high densities of ZnO nanorods grown on primary TiO2 fibers,20,21 but there are few reports on the application in photovoltaic device.
In this work, we fabricated a novel branched ZnO–TiO2 heterojunction nanorod arrays (B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs) on FTO substrates through a facile two-step hydrothermal method. Fig. 1 illustrates the fabrication stages of B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs and the resulting photoelectrodes for QDSCs. The photovoltaic performance of the QDSCs based on B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs (0.73%) is much higher than that of pristine TiO2 NRAs (0.47%) with the thickness of 1 μm, which can be attributed primarily to the synergistic effect of high QD loading, superior light scattering ability and efficient electron transfer resulting from the TiO2–ZnO heterojunction. Possible mechanisms for such enhancement in the PCE have been discussed.

2. Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of TiO2 NRAs
Vertically aligned TiO2 NRAs were directly grown on transparent FTO substrate (20 Ω per square) via a previously reported hydrothermal method.22 Briefly, 15 mL of deionized water was mixed with 15 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (36.5–38% by weight) followed by stirring at ambient condition for 5 min, then 0.5 mL tetrabutyl titanate (≥98.0% by weight) was added to the mixture and stirred for another 5 min. After that, the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (50 mL volume), where a cleaned FTO substrate was placed at an angle against the wall of the Teflon reactor with the conductive side facing down. The hydrothermal synthesis was maintained at 150 °C for 20 h in a regular laboratory oven. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the FTO substrate with the TiO2 NRAs was taken out, rinsed extensively with deionized water and allowed to dry in ambient air. All the TiO2 nanorod array films were treated in a TiO2 sol using the layer by layer adsorption and reaction (LBL-AR) route and then annealed at 500 °C for 1 h.23
2.2. Synthesis of B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs
Firstly, ZnO thin layer were coated on the surface of TiO2 nanorods by sol–gel method to seed the oriented growth of ZnO nanorods.24 In brief, 0.075 mol Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O and 0.075 mol monoethanolamine were dissolved in 100 mL 2-methoxyethanol solution at room temperature. The resultant solution was stirred at 60 °C for 0.5 h to yield a clear and homogeneous sol. Then, the pristine TiO2 nanorod array film was immersed into ZnO sol for 10 s at room temperature, and withdrawn at a speed of 2.0 cm min−1, followed by heating at 200 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the sol–gel deposition and baking procedures were repeated several times (typically 8 times) to obtain the desired thickness. Finally, the samples were annealed at 500 °C for 1 h. Next, branched ZnO nanorods were grown by immersing ZnO seed-coated TiO2 nanorod array film in aqueous solutions containing 25 mM zinc nitrate hydrate and 25 mM hexamethylenetetramine at 85 °C for 1–4 h. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the film was taken out and washed with deionized water to remove excess reactants, followed by drying in a N2 flow.
2.3. QDSC device fabrication
TiO2 NRAs and B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs were sensitized with CdS QDs under the same conditions using a modification of the previously reported successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) route.25 In a typical procedure, the nanorod arrays on FTO substrates were first immersed in a solution containing 0.125 M Cd(NO3)2 in ethanol for 2 min, to allow Cd2+ to adsorb onto the surface of TiO2 or ZnO. After rinsed by ethanol and dried in the steam of N2, the substrates were then dipped into a solution containing 0.125 M Na2S in methanol for another 2 min, where the pre-adsorbed Cd2+ reacted with S2− to form the desired CdS. The substrates were then rinsed by methanol to remove the excessive ions and dried again with N2. This typical procedure was repeated ten times to obtain the desired thickness of CdS. The Pt counter-electrode was prepared by dripping a drop of 19 mM H2PtCl6 isopropyl alcohol solution onto a FTO substrate, followed by heating at 385 °C for 30 min. The working electrode and the counter-electrode were cohered together by epoxy resin. The polysulfide electrolyte consisted of 2 M Na2S, 2 M S and 0.2 M KCl in methanol/water (7:3 by volume).
2.4. Characterizations
The morphologies and elemental analysis of the samples were characterized by An XL 30 ESEM FEG field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM; FEI Company) fitted with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). High-resolution electron microscopy (HRTEM) observation was carried out on a TECNAIG2 transmission electron microscope (FEI company) working at 200 kV. The crystal structure of the samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku D/Max-2550 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å; 50 kV, 200 mA) in the range of 20–80°(2θ) at a scanning rate of 5° min−1. The diffuse reflectance spectra and adsorption spectra were recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV3600, Shimadzu).
The lock-in based surface photovoltage (SPV) measurement system consisted of a source of monochromatic light, a lock-in amplifier (SR830-DSP) with a light chopper (model SR540), a photovoltaic cell, and a computer. A 500 W xenon lamp (CHFXQ500 W, Global xenon lamp power) and a grating monochromator (Omni-λ5006, Zolix) provided monochromatic light. A low chopping frequency of ∼23 Hz was used. In the photovoltaic cell, TiO2 NRAs or B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs directly grown on FTO substrate acted as a top electrode. A bare FTO electrode was used for the bottom electrode and a spacer of mica was inserted between the two electrodes. All of the SPV measurements were performed at room temperature and under ambient pressure.
Photocurrent–voltage characteristics (J–V curves) of QDSCs were recorded by an electrochemistry workgroup (CHI 630b, made in China) in the dark and under illumination. Sunlight was simulated with a 500 W xenon lamp. The incident light intensity was 100 mW cm−2, which was measured with a radiometer (Photo-electronic Instrument Co., attached to Beijing Normal University, China). The effective area of the cell is 0.2 cm2. The electron lifetime of the samples was obtained from open-circuit photovoltage decay (OCVD) measurements, which was conducted by turning off the illumination on QDSCs on a steady state and monitoring the subsequent decay of the Voc. Electrochemical impedance spectroscope (EIS) measurement was carried out with an electrochemical analyzer (LK2006A, Lanlike) under 100 mW cm−2 illumination in the frequency range of 0.5 Hz to 100 kHz at open-circuit voltage (Voc) with a potential pulse of 10 mV in amplitude.
3. Results and discussion
XRD analysis is employed to investigate the crystal phase of pristine TiO2 NRAs and B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs. The typical XRD pattern in Fig. 2 reveals that the crystal phase of TiO2 NRAs (curve a) used as the backbone is rutile phase (JCPDS 21-1276). The enhanced (002) diffraction peak indicates that the nanorods are well crystallized and oriented with respect to the FTO substrate. After ZnO is introduced into TiO2 NRAs, additional diffraction peaks with values of 31.8°, 34.4°, 47.6°, 56.7° and 68.0° appear, which can be indexed as hexagonal wurtzite-type ZnO (JCPDS 36-1451). In addition, the intensity of ZnO diffraction peaks increase with increasing hydrothermal growth time from 1 h to 4 h. These results demonstrate that the hydrothermal treatment successfully achieved ZnO–TiO2 heterojunctions that integrated the wurtzite phase ZnO nanostructure with the rutile TiO2.

Fig. 3 shows the top view FESEM images of B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs on FTO substrate prepared at 85 °C for various times. The bare TiO2 NRAs are tetragonal in shape with an average diameter of 50–100 nm and grown perpendicular to the FTO substrate with length of about 1 μm (Fig. S1†). After the hydrothermal growth time for 2 h, ZnO nanorods with length of around 200 nm are grown as nanobranches on the outer surface of TiO2 nanorod arrays. With the hydrothermal growth time going on, the density and length of ZnO nanorods are both increased. After 4 h of growth, highly dense ZnO nanorods are dispersed orientationally on TiO2 nanorod tips with corolla-like nanostructure. According to the side view FESEM images (Fig. S2†), it is observed that ZnO nanorods with length of 500 nm are also densely grown on the side surface of TiO2 NRAs which completely cover the backbone.

CdS QDs were deposited on TiO2 NRAs and B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs (hydrothermal time at 85 °C for 2 h) by SILAR method. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, both of the ordered structures are retained after deposition with CdS QDs for 10 cycles. The side view FESEM images reveal that some small particles are attached to the surface of TiO2 or ZnO nanorods. The XRD patterns in Fig. 4c indicate that CdS QDs are formed with a cubic phase structure according to the JCPDS card no. 80-0019. EDX measurement was also applied to determine the composition of the nanostructure. In the spectra, the approximate 1:1 atomic ratio of Cd to S in the samples further confirms the stoichiometric formation of CdS. Additionally, the element mass percentages of Cd and S in B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs-CdS film are much higher than that in TiO2 NRAs-CdS film, implying that more QDs are deposited on the B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs surface for their larger surface area in comparison with bare TiO2 NRAs.

Fig. 5 displays the typical TEM images of B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs before and after CdS deposition. As shown in Fig. 5a, the entire ZnO–TiO2 nanorod is about 1 μm in length and ZnO nanorod branches are almost directly grown on the whole surface, which agree with the FESEM observation. Fig. 5b is the HRTEM image showing the interface region of rutile trunk and ZnO branch (white frame area in Fig. 5a). The lattice spacings of 0.26 nm for the branch and 0.32 nm for the backbone correspond, respectively, to the (0002) plane of the wurtzite ZnO and the (110) plane of rutile TiO2. The TEM and HRTEM images in Fig. 5c and d indicate that CdS QDs with diameter of 5–10 nm are coated on a single-crystalline ZnO nanorod grown along the [0001] direction. The observed 0.33 nm fringes of QDs on the nanorod corresponds to the (111) plane of the cubic phase of CdS.

Fig. 6a shows the diffuse reflectance spectra of bare TiO2 NRAs and B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs before QD deposition. The reflectance values of B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs are larger than that of TiO2 NRAs in the wavelength range of 400–600 nm, revealing that the incident light is significantly scattered by the ZnO nanorod branches with length of several hundred nanometers. After CdS sensitization, it is evident that a significant increase of the absorption intensity occurred in the B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs in the visible region compared with that of TiO2 NRAs. The results indicate that a mass of ZnO nanorods covering the entire TiO2 nanorods by interweaving with neighbours allow more QDs loading and incident light to be scattered, which can improve the light harvesting efficiency.

The SPV method is a well-established non-contact technique for the characterization of semiconductors, which relies on analyzing the illumination-induced changes in the surface voltage.26 It is an effectively way to study the process of photo-induced charge separation and transfer in the surface and interface.27–29 Fig. 7 presents the SPV spectra of CdS-sensitized TiO2 NRAs and B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs. After CdS QDs coating, both of the samples extend the SPV response to visible light region, which is in good agreement with the results of UV-vis transmission spectra. The inset is the corresponding phase spectra that show the statistic kinetic characteristics for each AC SPV spectrum with a distinguishable response. For the two curves, the phase values are in the range of 60°–180°, which correspond to negative SPV signals. This signal implies that the photo-generated electrons generally transfer to the FTO substrate illuminated from the FTO/TiO2 interface.30 The stronger photovoltage intensity of CdS-sensitized B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs in the visible light region indicates that more photo-induced electrons are accumulated at the FTO substrate as compared to CdS-sensitized TiO2 NRAs. In the phase spectra, the less phase retardation with respect to 180° from 650 to 420 nm for the hierarchical ZnO–TiO2 photoelectrode means that the trend of photo-induced electrons moving to the FTO substrate is enhanced.30,31 According to the previous reports, ZnO has more negative conduction than TiO2, and thus photo-generated electrons on ZnO can be easily injected into the conduction band (CB) of TiO2.32,33 In the CdS-sensitized B-ZnO–TiO2 photoanode, the TiO2–ZnO heterojunction will provide a driving force for the photo-excited electrons injection from ZnO nanorod branches to rutile trunks, which can improve the electron collection efficiency.

Fig. 8a shows the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves for the solar cells measured under illumination conditions. It is observed that QDSCs based on TiO2 nanorod array photoanode shows a power conversion efficiency (η) of 0.47% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) value of 3.01 mA cm−2 and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) value of 438 mV. Interestingly, when B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs is applied as photoanode in QDSCs, 0.73% photoconversion efficiency is achieved with a Jsc value of 4.66 mA cm−2 and a Voc value of 510 mV. In Fig. 8b, the dark current of device based on B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs decreases compared to that of bare TiO2 NRAs, indicating a lower charge recombination from the conduction band of TiO2 to the redox couple (S2−/Sn2−) in the electrolyte. Then, we further investigated the charge recombination kinetics by the OCVD technique which provides a continuous reading of the lifetime as a function of Voc at high-voltage resolution. The electron lifetime is given by τn = −(kT/e)(dVoc/dt)−1,34 where kT is the thermal energy, e is the positive elementary charge, and dVoc/dt is the first-order time derivation of the Voc. In Fig. 8c, the τn for B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs is evidently larger than that of TiO2 NRAs, indicating a reduction in the rate of electron recombination, in good agreement with expectations from the observed increase in Voc.

(c) The electron lifetime as a function of Voc and (d) Nyquist plots of the EIS spectra of QDSCs using various photoanodes. The inset of (d) is corresponding equivalent circuit. 
Finally, EIS analysis was performed to elucidate the characteristics of electron transport in the QDSCs fabricated with TiO2 NRAs and B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs. In our EIS diagrams, two obvious semicircles are detected in the Nyquist plots. The large semicircle in middle frequency region is related to the electron transport resistance (R2) within the film and interfacial capacitance (CPE2) at the photoanode/electrolyte interface.35,36 The results reveal that B-ZnO–TiO2 NRA photoanode exhibits a smaller R2 than that of TiO2 NRA photoanode, reflecting acceleration of electron transfer process in the B-ZnO–TiO2 NRA photoanode. This result further confirms that the introduction of ZnO nanorods into TiO2 NRAs/CdS film favors the electron transfer from CdS to TiO2. The IPCE result (Fig. S3†) indicates that QDSCs based on B-ZnO–TiO2 nanorod array photoelectrode has better photoresponse than that made of the TiO2 nanorod array photoelectrode in the visible range. IPCE can be expressed as follows:37IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ)φinjηcol
The IPCE result is determined by the light harvesting efficiency of the film (LHE(λ)), the injection (φinj) and collection efficiencies (ηcol) of the photoelectrons, which are generally wavelength dependent and strongly affected by the structure of the photoelectrode. As discussed above, the B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs structure provides large surface area for QD loading and better light scattering property, which contributed to the increased LHE(λ). ηcol is dependent on electron transport in photoanode and charge recombination with the electrolyte:  where Kt is transport rate constant, and Kr is recombination rate constant.38 Based on the previous discussion, the TiO2–ZnO heterojunction is favorable for electron transfer and charge separation at the interface. In the meantime, the interlayer of ZnO could also lower the recombination rate by preventing the electrons in the TiO2 CB back to the redox electrolyte, as shown in Fig. 9. Thus, the increased Kt and decreased Kr result in higher electron collection efficiency in B-ZnO–TiO2 nanorod array photoelectrode in compared to that of TiO2 nanorod array photoelectrode, which contribute to the enhancement of IPCE and Jsc.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have employed a facile two-step hydrothermal process to fabricate the 3D branched ZnO–TiO2 heterojunction nanorod arrays on FTO substrates and applied them as photoanodes in QDSCs. The ZnO nanorod branches on the rutile trunks offer increased QD loading and high light scattering property. In addition, the presence of TiO2–ZnO heterojunction is favorable for electron transfer and charge separation, reducing charge recombination at the electrode/electrolyte interface. As a result, QDSCs assembled with B-ZnO–TiO2 NRAs exhibit an overall 0.73% energy conversion efficiency, which is 55% improvement over the QDSCs based on TiO2 NRAs. More importantly, the branched hierarchical nanostructure provides a tremendous potential for use in photocatalysts, photoelectrochemical water splitting, supercapacitors and Li ion batteries.
