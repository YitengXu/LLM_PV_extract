    , Accepted 25th March 2015First published on 27th March 2015AbstractWe introduced an alkylthio-substituent on the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene side chain of the polymer and synthesized a new low band gap 2D-conjugated polymer, PSTTBDT-FTT. It showed more red-shifted absorption spectra and higher hole mobility than PTTBDT-FTT without the thio-functionality. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PSTTBDT-FTT device reached 8.61%. This work demonstrates that the newly synthesized PSTTBDT-FTT is a promising donor material for high efficiency OPVs.
A bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic cell (OPV) is a promising photovoltaic technology for clean and renewable energy sources due to its superior properties such as mechanical flexibility, lightweight, visible transparency, and large-area manufacturing compatibility.1 To improve the photovoltaic performance of OPVs, tremendous efforts have been devoted to designing, synthesizing and optimizing the photo-active donor polymers in order to have suitable molecular energy levels, broad absorption bands, high hole mobility, and so on.2 Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) is a promising electron donating building block for constructing high-performance photovoltaic polymers.3 Li et al. reported the effect of the alkylthio side group on the optoelectronic properties of polythiophene derivatives in comparison with the alkyl and alkoxy side groups. The alkylthio side group made absorption of polythiophene slightly red-shifted and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level down-shifted compared to that of the polythiophene with alkyl side groups.4 Very recently, a series of low bandgap copolymers using alkylthio-substituted BDT were synthesized by several research groups. The alkylthio group could provide high open circuit voltage (VOC) through lowering the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of donor polymers. Peng et al. reported an alkylthio-substituted BDT-based polymer PBDTFBZS that exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.74%.5 Li et al. introduced an alkylthio substituent on the 4,8-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTT) unit and synthesized a 2D-conjugated polymer, PBDTT-S-TT. It showed more red-shifted absorption, lower-lying HOMO energy levels, highly enhanced hole mobility and photovoltaic properties.6 Subsequently, Hou et al. further improved the device performance to as high as 9.48% through the optimization of the chain length of the alkylthio group.7
Recently, we reported a new 4,8-bis(thieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (TTBDT) building block by introducing thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) groups onto the BDT unit. In general, the ring extension of the π-conjugated system is an effective way to obtain high performance polymers through the efficient π-electron delocalization, facilitating charge carrier transport and π–π stacking. In spite of the extended π-conjugation system, PTTBDT-FTT exhibited a relatively low VOC due to a high-lying HOMO energy level. The PCE reached 7.44% for conventional OPV devices and 7.71% for inverted OPV devices.8 In this work, for further improving the photovoltaic performance of the PTTBDT-FTT, we introduced the alkylthio functional group on the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene side chains of PTTBDT-FTT and synthesized a new 2D-conjugated polymer, PSTTBDT-FTT. We compared the physical, optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the resulting polymers to demonstrate the alkylthio group effect on photovoltaic devices. Molecular structures of the synthesized polymers are shown in Fig. 1.

The synthetic routes of the monomer and the polymer are shown in Schemes 1 and 2. Synthetic details are provided in the ESI.† The polymerization was carried out with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst and refluxed for 16 h under argon protection. The molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with calibration against polystyrene standards. The number average molecular weights (Mn) of PTTBDT-FTT and PSTTBDT-FTT were found to be 25000 and 21000 g mol−1 with PDIs of 2.5 and 2.3, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were carried out to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymers, and the TGA plots of the three polymers are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). All of the polymers exhibited good stability, showing less than 5% weight loss at around 400 °C. The molecular weights and thermal properties of the polymers are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†).

 Scheme 2  Synthesis and chemical structure of the polymers. 

Fig. 2(a) and (b) shows the absorption spectra of the two polymers in dilute chloroform solution and in thin films. The two polymers showed broad and strong absorption in the wavelength region from 300 to 800 nm. The well-defined absorption peaks with a vibronic shoulder in the longer wavelength region of the absorption spectrum (700–800 nm) imply that strong π–π stacking and some ordered aggregation exist.9 The maximum absorption wavelength of PTTBDT-FTT in solution was 691 nm while that of PSTTBDT-FTT was 703 nm. In comparison, those of the corresponding polymer films moved to longer wavelengths with absorption maxima of 707 and 717 nm, respectively. The red shifted absorption of polymer thin films compared with the corresponding polymer solutions is commonly observed for conjugated polymers due to the aggregation of the polymer main chains and enhanced inter-chain interactions in the solid state. The main absorption band of PSTTBDT-FTT is red-shifted by 10 nm compared with that of PTTBDT-FTT, possibly due to the electron-donating alkylthio side chains in the polymers. The optical band-gaps (Eoptg) of the PTTBDT-FTT and PSTTBDT-FTT films were determined to be 1.59 and 1.56 eV, respectively, by measuring their UV-visible absorption onsets. Table S1 (ESI†) summarizes the absorption peak wavelengths (λabs), absorption edge wavelengths (λedge), and optical band gaps (Eoptg) of the polymers.

The HOMO energy levels of polymers were determined by measuring the oxidation onset using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level was determined from the measured HOMO energy level and the optical band gap obtained from the absorption edge. Accordingly, the measured HOMO energy levels of PTTBDT-FTT and PSTTBDT-FTT were −5.31 and −5.35 eV, respectively (Fig. S2(a), ESI†). The HOMO energy level of PSTTBDT-FTT is ∼0.04 eV lower than that of PTTBDT-FTT. The LUMO energy levels of PTTBDT-FTT and PSTTBDT-FTT were measured to be −3.72 and −3.79 eV, respectively. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers are illustrated in Fig. S2(b) (ESI†). The UV-visible absorption properties, Eoptg values, and HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the polymers are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†).
OPVs were fabricated using PTTBDT-FTT or PSTTBDT-FTT as the electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C70-butylic acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the electron acceptor with an inverted device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM(1:1.5, w/w)/MoO3/Ag. The VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE values of the fabricated devices are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 3(a) shows current–voltage (J–V) curves of the OPVs based on the polymer:PC71BM blends under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The best device performance was obtained by using 10 mg/mL of the polymer in chlorobenzene containing 3 vol% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) for spin-coating with a polymer to PC71BM blend ratio of 1:1.5 (w/w); these conditions are similar to those of other analogue polymers consisting of BDT and FTT units such as PBDTTT-C-T, PBDTTT-E, and PTB7.

The OPV devices exhibited the best PCEs of 7.71 and 8.61% for PTTBDT-FTT and PSTTBDT-FTT, respectively. The VOC values of the PTTBDT-FTT and PSTTBDT-FTT devices were 0.77 and 0.80 V, respectively, at a donor to acceptor weight ratio of 1:1.5. The higher VOC value of the PSTTBDT-FTT device could be explained by the lower HOMO energy level of PSTTBDT-FTT (–5.35 eV) than that of PTTBDT-FTT (–5.31 eV) because the VOC is proportional to the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor polymer and the LUMO of the acceptor. The measured JSC values of the devices fabricated using PTTBDT-FTT and PSTTBDT-FTT were 14.70 and 15.38 mA cm−2, respectively. In principle, the photocurrent generation of the OPV devices depends on a series of processes such as optical absorption, formation and dissociation of excitons, and charge collection.
To elucidate the vertical charge carrier mobility in OPV devices, we fabricated hole-only devices to determine the space charge limited current (SCLC). The hole-only devices were fabricated with structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer or polymer:PC71BM (1:1.5 w/w)/MoO3/Ag; the mobilities were calculated using the Mott–Gurney equation. When the hole mobilities of pure polymer devices and blend devices were compared, it can be seen that the hole mobilities of PSTTBDT-FTT (6.45 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and PSTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM (1:1.5 w/w) (1.26 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) devices are higher than those of the PTTBDT-FTT (1.22 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and PTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM (1:1.5 w/w) (9.50 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) devices, at an electric field of 500 (V cm−1)1/2 (Fig. S4, ESI†). This much higher hole mobility contributes to the higher JSC and FF, in the PSTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM device, because the recombination processes are reduced by the increase in hole mobility and enhanced charge collection efficiency.10 The characteristics of the fabricated SCLC results are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†).
To investigate the p–n hetero-junction morphology, an atomic force microscope (AFM) was employed for the donor–acceptor blend films (1:1.5, w/w, with 3 vol% of DIO). As shown in Fig. 4, the blend films based on PTTBDT-FTT and PSTTBDT-FTT exhibited uniform and bi-continuous networks, indicating good miscibility between the polymer donor and PC71BM. The interpenetrating network between polymers and PC71BM provides a large interface area for efficient charge separation and transportation to achieve high JSC and FF in their OPVs. The PSTTBDT-FTT film showed a smoother surface than the PTTBDT-FTT film. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the PTTBDT-FTT and PSTTBDT-FTT:PC71BM blend films were 1.88 and 1.38 nm, respectively.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices based on PTTBDT-FTT (and PSTTBDT-FTT):PC71BM (1:1.5, w/w, with 3 vol% DIO) prepared under optimum conditions are shown in Fig. 3(b). The PSTTBDT-FTT-based device showed higher EQE in the range of 600–720 nm than the PTTBDT-FTT-based device, which is in good agreement with the JSC values.
In conclusion, a new 2D-conjugated polymer containing alkylthio-substituted thieno[3,2-b]thiophene on a BDT unit, PSTTBDT-FTT, was designed and synthesized for further improving the photovoltaic performance of PTTBDT-FTT. It was found that the alkylthio substitution on thieno[3,2-b]thiophene side chains down-shifted the HOMO energy level and slightly red-shifted the absorption of the 2D-conjugated polymers compared to the PTTBDT-FTT without the thio functionality. The OPV device based on PSTTBDT-FTT showed an enhanced VOC of 0.80 V and JSC of 15.38 mA cm−2, resulting in a much improved PCE of 8.61%. The results indicate that molecular modification by introducing the alkylthio group on the conjugated thieno[3,2-b]thiophene side chain would be a promising strategy to lower the HOMO energy level and increase the hole mobility of the donor polymers for improving the photovoltaic performances of OPVs.
