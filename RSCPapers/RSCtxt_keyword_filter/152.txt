    , Accepted 9th March 2020First published on 9th March 2020AbstractHybrid organic–inorganic perovskite (HOIP) materials have caught significant attention in photovoltaics and photoelectronics for their outstanding photovoltaic properties. However, their instability to various environment, such as illumination, temperature, moisture and oxygen, hinders their way to commercialization. To figure out the interaction mechanism between H2O and CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3), extensive theoretical studies have been carried out; however, the experimental results are insufficient and inconsistent. Here, we systematically investigate and compare the influence of H2O on MAPbI3 perovskite films with or without DMF) post-annealing in dark or light condition. The interaction between H2O and the surface of pristine MAPbI3 leads to the fusion of grain boundaries thus grain growth into micron level in short-time moisture exposure. While the penetration of H2O into MAPbI3 results in swelled crystalline whisker, cracking into smaller grains in long-time exposure upon the release of H2O. However, no degradation occurs in dark condition. As the DMF post-annealing treatment changes the surface states of MAPbI3, the interactions between the external H2O and internal MAPbI3 significantly varies from the pristine MAPbI3. Three different surface states with different topographies have influence on the interaction process and mechanism with H2O, leading to different decomposition rates, the striped surface that is the most rough among the three and experiencing the minimum change in surface potential with exposure to 80% humidity decomposes into PbI2 fastest. However, the addition of light will once again affect the aforementioned process. It is found that even ambient light could severely speed up the moisture-induced decomposition of MAPbI3, while the N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) post-annealing treatment significantly improves the stability of MAPbI3 films upon exposure to humidity and illumination, benefiting from the MAI-deficient thus H2O resistant surface.
Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite (HOIP) materials have attracted considerable attention of the research community for the booming power conversion efficiency (PCE) of HOIP solar cells from 3.8% in 2009 to over 24% presently.1,2 These materials have outstanding properties, such as large light absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length, high charge carrier mobility and life time as well as low recombination rate.3–8 High tolerance for the impurities, abundant low-cost raw materials, and low-energy solution processing contribute to their commercialization.9,10 However, their poor stability, particularly moisture stability is their Achilles’ heel, so far precluding their practical applications.11–13
Numerous attempts have been made to improve the moisture stability of HOIPs, particularly that of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3), which involve two aspects:14 one is to optimize the properties of the material itself by adding additives. Ion substitution resulting in a more stable structure as well as the addition of cross-linkable materials straining the organic and inorganic part can prevent water from intruding inside.15,16 I− has also been partially substituted by Br− or SCN− for a shorter bond length or larger formation constant.17,18 The other is interface engineering, spreading a protective layer on the HOIP surface to seal it off from the H2O outside. Functional materials such as polymers, inorganic materials and some molecules that can improve surface hydrophobicity through the supramolecular interactions have been used in the fabrication of devices.19–23
While extensive efforts have been made to improve the efficiency and lifetime of the devices, no unanimous conclusion can be drawn on where or how the moisture acts on the MAPbI3 films.24 The inconsistent stability reported by different groups varying from hours to months for films or devices suggests that the interaction mechanism between the moisture and MAPbI3 still needs to be studied.25 Moreover, slight differences in the preparation or treatment methods exert tremendous influences upon the stability of MAPbI3 films. The presence of moisture during the MAPbI3 perovskite preparation process has been shown to improve the film crystallinity and device efficiency.26,27 However, the presence of H2O has also been suggested to catalyze the decomposition of MAPbI3 into PbI2 and MAI. Until now, the presence of monohydrate perovskite (MAPbI3·H2O) and dihydrates (MA4PbI6·2H2O) have been demonstrated in the MAPbI3 perovskite films upon exposure to water vapor due to the insertion of water into MAPbI3, leading to lattice expansion.28 Barnes et al., believed that the formation MAPbI3·H2O could be reversed by dry air flow as long as there is absence of excess water, while MA4PbI6·2H2O resulted from irreversible decomposition.28 The size and orientation of the grains, the grain boundaries (GBs), the surface defect states, and so forth, have been considered as well, particularly in theoretical calculation.25,29–32 Besides, the effect of excess PbI2 in the perovskite film on its stability also arouses a lot of controversy and speculation.33–36 Most groups believe the beneficial effect of excess PbI2 on the device efficiency and stability, although there are different opinions on the existing forms and interaction models.
To understand the underlying interactions between the moisture and HOIPs, we herein systematically investigated and compared the evolution of the crystal structure, morphology, and electrical properties of the MAPbI3 polycrystalline films with varied surface states in delicately controlled 80% humidity and either dark or illumination condition. The results show that short-term interactions between moisture and the pristine MAPbI3 film in dark condition enlarges the grains to the micrometer level, while long-term interactions cause the surface collapse of the swelled micrograin into small grains when returning to the ambient condition, although no decomposition occurs. In contrast, the MAPbI3 film post-annealed in an N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) atmosphere exhibited a little morphological change until 48 h of interactions with moisture after which it started to decompose. In the process, the Fermi level shifted up and the conductivity of the perovskite film improved. The degradation significantly accelerated when light was introduced, particularly for the pristine MAPbI3 film without DMF post-annealing.
Experimental section
Perovskite film fabrication
10 mL of HI (57 wt% in H2O, Sigma-Aldrich) was mixed with 18 mL of CH3NH2 (33 wt% in absolute ethanol, Sigma-Aldrich) in an argon atmosphere at 0 °C and kept for 2 h. The reaction solution was transferred to a rotary evaporator at 50 °C until the precipitation of white solid, which was dissolved in ethanol and recrystallized afterwards. The final product was obtained after washing, filtering and vacuum drying.
FTO (NSG, 15 Ω sq−1) was cleaned ultrasonically twice in H2O, ethanol, acetone and 2-propanol, respectively, for 30 min. UV-Ozone treatment was performed for 10 min. After performing the spray pyrolysis of 20 mM titanium diisopropoxidebis(acetylacetonate) solution (75 wt% in 2-propanol, Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in 1-butanol (≥99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) at 450 °C, FTO was heated to 500 °C for 1 h to achieve compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) having about 50 nm thickness.
The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 578 mg of PbI2 (99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 200 mg of CH3NH3I in 1 mL of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, ≥99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich). 60 μL of this precursor solution was dropped on the UV-Ozone treated substrate and spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 30 s. 180 μL of anhydrous chlorobenzene (≥99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) was dripped onto the sample during the spin-coating. The film was then transferred onto a hotplate at 100 °C for 10 min to obtain the as-prepared MAPbI3 film. The other MAPbI3 film was annealed under DMF vapor at 110 °C for 20 min.
All the samples investigated were stored in N2 atmosphere and wrapped in a tin foil for avoiding light after certain time of exposure in 80% RH and dark or illumination condition. The 80% relative humidity (RH) was controlled by the CaCl2 standard aqueous solution. For the stability test in our experiments, the MAPbI3 perovskite films were directly exposed to a high humidity of 80% for up to 48 hours to accelerate the interactions of H2O and MAPbI3. Different from the stability tests of practical devices, which are usually encapsulated and then exposed to humidity for testing the long-term stability, such exposure conditions in our experiments allow for the investigation of the surface-state dependent morphology and electronic property evolution of the perovskite grains.
Characterizations
All X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku D/max 2500) with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å), operating at 40 kV and 40 mA at a scan rate of 3° min−1 in the 2θ range from 10° to 60°. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, including Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), were recorded using a Multimode 8 (Bruker) in an argon atmosphere at room temperature and pressure. The silicon probes (PFQNE-AL, Bruker), particularly designed for the KPFM measurement with a force constant of 1.5 N m−1 and a resonant frequency of 250 Hz, were applied in our frequency-modulation KPFM. Samples characterized via XRD and AFM were stable in the N2 atmosphere and dark condition.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 exhibits the XRD patterns of pristine MAPbI3 perovskite films at varying exposure time to 80% humidity in dark condition, and the AFM images with exposure time of 0 h, 4 h, 8 h and 48 h, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1a, the XRD patterns show similar features well-indexed to the tetragonal MAPbI3. The diffraction peaks at 14.3°, 28.6° and 32.0° correspond to the diffractions from the (110), (220) and (310) planes of the tetragonal phase with lattice parameters of a = 8.849 Å, b = 8.849 Å and c = 12.642 Å, respectively. The multiplied intensity of the diffraction peaks at 14.3° and 28.6° for the sample with an exposure time of 4 h to moisture inferred the improved crystallinity. Moreover, there are no other peaks detected, indicating that no other compounds formed during this evolution.

The blue rectangle demonstrates the (110)-orientation evolution of MAPbI3. (b–e) The corresponding AFM topographic images of pristine MAPbI3 perovskite films with exposure time of 0 h (b), 4 h (c), 8 h (d) and 48 h (e). 
The AFM images in Fig. 1b–e show the typical morphologies for each sample. The grain size of the pristine MAPbI3 film without any treatment is mostly less than 200 nm (Fig. 1b). The root-mean-square (RMS) value of the surface roughness is 9.90 nm in the 3 μm × 3 μm scanning area. After 4 h in 80% humidity, the grain size increases significantly to a micron level (Fig. 1c). However, the flatness remains almost unchanged (RMS = 9.82 nm, 3 μm × 3 μm). Longer-time exposure to moisture, from 8 h to 48 h, leads to the cracking of MAPbI3 into small grains less than 100 nm in size (Fig. 1d and e).
Combining the XRD and AFM results, we can deduce a comprehensive picture of the moisture-induced changes without illumination in the pristine MAPbI3 perovskite film. The interactions between MAPbI3 and H2O, particularly the hydrogen bond between CH3NH3+ and H2O, facilitates the adsorption of adequate H2O onto the surface and GBs of the perovskite film, thus leading the integration of initial perovskite crystals into larger grains.37,38 In this stage, water molecules are not inside MAPbI3, as the sample keeps dark brown. However, further exposure in 80% humidity contributes to the intrusion of H2O into the interior of the MAPbI3 grains, forming almost transparent pale yellow hydrated intermediate structures (Fig. S1†).39 The uptake of water into the grains is accompanied by the lattice expansion. When water molecules depart from the lattice, sudden shrink in the volume results in cracking of the large grains into smaller grains with significant increase in the RMS values (20.46 nm and 30.86 nm for 8 h and 48 h exposure in moisture, respectively).
In brief, for the pristine MAPbI3 films, H2O atoms can easily intrude into grains, forming a reversible hydrate perovskite, which is stable under dark condition. The hydrate perovskite will release water and return to perovskite when the environmental humidity decreases. Thus, no decomposition into PbI2 (at 12.8° of XRD patterns) occurs since the moving in and out of the water molecules is kind of reversible.
Solvent annealing is one of the commonly used methods for improving the perovskite crystalline properties owing to the fact that DMF with high solubility for PbI2 and MAI can provide driving force for longer ions or molecular diffusion yielding larger grains.40–42 Compared with Fig. 1b, the MAPbI3 films with grown grains and dense surface can be obviously observed in Fig. 2b. The improved MAPbI3 crystallization might also contribute to the film stability. The intensities and positions of the diffraction peaks of the DMF post-annealed perovskite films after 48 h exposure in 80% humidity almost remain unchanged in Fig. 2a, except for the conspicuous diffraction peak at 12.8°, indicating the formation of PbI2 in the sample that has been kept in 80% humidity and dark condition for 48 h.

Nanoparticles in red ellipses correspond to PbI2. 
The typical morphologies exhibited in Fig. 2b and c are supplementary evidences for the moisture stability of the DMF post-annealed perovskite films as no clear differences in the morphology are observed until the exposure time reaches 48 h when several small particles appear on the surface (Fig. 2c), which are marked by red ellipses. Compared with the XRD patterns of these films (Fig. 1a), these nanoparticles should be PbI2, resulting from the decomposition of MAPbI3. Almost no change in the morphology indicates that DMF post-annealing prevent H2O getting into the grains until the decomposition takes place in defects for 48 h exposure. Notably, all the nanoparticles decomposed from MAPbI3 are formed on the striped surfaces (Fig. 2c), which are marked by red ellipses. The high-resolution morphology of the MAPbI3 perovskite film with DMF annealing exhibited in Fig. 3a shows the existence of three topographies: Sur-1 (Fig. 3b) is smooth and flat, the RMS value is only 0.0863 nm in the scanning area 125 nm × 125 nm; surfaces on which the PbI2 nanoparticles form first is abbreviated as Sur-2, which is striped obviously (RMS = 1.19 nm, 125 nm × 125 nm), as shown in Fig. 3c; and the roughness of Sur-3 (Fig. 3d) is between them (RMS = 0.358 nm, 125 nm × 125 nm). According to the above classification, every plane has a corresponding category. The topographical image displays individual crystal grains and various crystal facets within these grains and roughness is related to the atomic arrangement on the surface.43 As the nanoparticles are formed only on Sur-2, it indicates that the surface states have influence on the decomposition process.

To further understand the evolution of the DMF post-annealed MAPbI3 perovskite films in 80% humidity and dark condition, KPFM investigations were carried out. Fig. 4 shows the AFM morphologies, peak force error distributions and surface potential (SP) distributions of the samples with different exposure time: 0 h, 12 h, 24 h and 36 h. Peak force error distributions are characterized to exhibit more details about the topographies, as an assistance to distinguish these surface states from each other. The images in Fig. 4a–c indicate that Sur-1, Sur-2 and Sur-3 can be distinguished by SP when the samples are not exposed to humidity. The comparisons of the morphologies, peak force error distributions and SP distributions of the sample with different exposure time illustrate that SP of the sample first shows a downward trend on the whole; second, SP of Sur-3 declines fastest, from the initial highest SP value of three to the final value, which is similar to Sur-1, and the other information (morphologies and peak force error distributions) of them is indistinguishable as well, indicating probably the similar surface state, which is to be studied further. Moreover, Sur-2 becomes the surface state with the highest SP value. The above results are quantifiable in Fig. 5, which is the statistical curve of the SP value of Sur-1, Sur-2 and Sur-3 as a function of exposure time. Precise SP values of the DMF post-annealed films with different exposure time periods in Fig. 5 are extracted from the positions marked in Fig. S3.† As shown in Fig. 5, the average SP value of Sur-1 decreases from −109 mV to −283 mV after exposure to 80% humidity and dark condition for 36 h, a total drop of 174 mV, and the average SP values of Sur-2 and Sur-3 drop from −17 mV to −156 mV, and from 71 mV to −277 mV, respectively. The shift-down of the energy level alignment indicates that the content of MAI decreases in the perovskite, particularly on the surface of perovskite. Sur-3 has the greatest decrease in SP, however, Sur-2, which has the smallest change in the morphology and surface potential, is the first to decompose into PbI2. Since a higher surface potential means a lower Fermi level, the Fermi level of the MAPbI3 perovskite film with the DMF post-annealing treatment shifts up under the influence of moisture, indicating a more n-type semiconductor. These observations are consistent with the statement that the surface is becoming MAI-deficient and PbI2-rich, which could prevent the MAPbI3 from H2O. Thus, we can draw the conclusion that the surface topography such as Sur-1 and Sur-3 is more conducive to the moisture stability of the MAPbI3 than Sur-2.

Red, blue and white ellipses exhibit the AFM morphologies, peak force error distributions and SP distributions of Sur-1, Sur-2 and Sur-3, respectively.

The stability of the pristine MAPbI3 in 80% humidity and N2 atmosphere under ambient illumination is shown in Fig. 6a. The diffraction peak of PbI2 at 12.8° can be detected for the sample exposed to 80% humidity with ambient light for 4 h, while no degradation occurs after 48 h in N2 atmosphere, suggesting that even the ambient illumination can significantly accelerate the decomposition of MAPbI3 upon exposure to moisture, even though its intensity is much weaker than 1 Sun for solar cell measurements. In contrast, PbI2 gradually appeared after 12 h exposure to 80% humidity and ambient illumination for the DMF post-annealed MAPbI3 film (Fig. 6b). Comparing Fig. 6a and b, the formation of PbI2 is much slower in the DMF-treated MAPbI3 films than that in the pristine films. These results suggest that light appreciably affects the stability of the reversible hydrate perovskite, promoting its decomposition into PbI2. The much slower decomposition for the DMF post-annealed MAPbI3 films also supports the previous observations that DMF post-annealing can keep the H2O out of the grains, precluding the formation of hydrate. The stability of the MAPbI3 perovskite films exposed to light and high humidity can be significantly improved by DMF post-annealing. All these findings can be further supported by the photographs of all discussed samples taken at varied conditions (Fig. S2†).

Conclusions
In summary, in order to understand the instability of hybrid perovskites under moisture and light illumination, we prepared perovskite films with different surface states, which are commonly used in the fabrication of perovskite solar cells, that is pristine MAPbI3 perovskite films and that with DMF post-annealing. The interactions of moisture and these two kinds of films under dark or light conditions have been systematically investigated and compared via XRD and KPFM techniques. The pristine MAPbI3 films are susceptible to moisture, fusing into large grains in short exposure time or cracking into small grains in long-term moisture exposure, while no degradation occurs in dark condition in 48 h. However, the introduction of ambient light significantly aggravates the decomposition of MAPbI3 and the formation of PbI2. In contrast, the DMF post-annealing treatment results in three distinct surface states, interacting with H2O in different ways. The reduction of SP indicates that the surface is PbI2-richer, effectively preventing H2O molecules from permeating into the MAPbI3 grains. Sur-1 and Sur-3, whose RMS is smaller, initially, show similar electrical and morphological characteristics with exposure to 80% humidity for 48 h. While small particles of PbI2 are found on Sur-2, which exhibits obviously striped and is the roughest one in the three. The absence of Sur-2 is beneficial to the moisture stability of MAPbI3. Moreover, the resistance to H2O appreciably improves the stability of the MAPbI3 further in the presence of both light and moisture. These findings would provide some clues for the fabrication of more stable perovskite materials and devices.
