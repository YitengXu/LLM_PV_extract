Two different types of metal NPs, viz. citrate capped gold (Au) and silver (Ag) NPs, were blended (20 v/v%) separately into a PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer. For the dual cathode buffer layer, we chose two different hole blocking layers, BPhen and BCP, with a LiF/Al cathode contact. The combined influence of both the NPs and the dual cathode buffer layers was investigated with two blend polymers, rrP3HT:PC61BM and rrP3HT:PC71BM. It was observed that for both the blend polymer systems the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases significantly in the presence of PEDOT:PSS + AuNPs and PEDOT:PSS + AgNPs with BCP/LiF/Al as a cathode contact compared to the bare PEDOT:PSS layer. In particular, in the presence of PEDOT:PSS + AuNPs and BCP/LiF/Al, the highest PCE was observed for both the blend polymers because of the better band alignment of BCP/LiF/Al with the active layers and the superior surface plasmon resonance of the AuNPs in the visible spectrum compared to AgNPs. The device with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS + AuNPs/rrP3HT:PC61BM/BCP/LiF/Al configuration showed a PCE (η) of 4.99% with Jsc = 13.9 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.59 V and FF = 62%, whereas for ITO/PEDOT:PSS + AuNPs/rrP3HT:PC71BM/BCP/LiF/Al, the device showed a PCE (η) of 5.65% with Jsc = 16.1 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.58 V and FF = 61%. These results conclusively explain the combined influence of the dual cathode buffer layer and the plasmonic metal NPs to remarkably improve the PCE and overall device performance of rrP3HT:PCBM based BHJ solar cells.
Introduction
The development of highly efficient organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells has been rapidly increasing in the last few decades due to their considerable fabrication advantage, that is, the potential to achieve mechanically flexible and light weight devices with large area production capability compared to the silicon technology.1–10 However, there are several important issues such as high power conversion efficiency (PCE), device life time, large area production, etc., that are yet to be improved in the organic device technology to compete with the conventional silicon technology which dominates the market presently.11–16 The PCE of BHJ solar cells is primarily controlled by two factors, namely (1) the amount of light absorbed by the active blend material, and (2) the collection of dissociated charges at the cathode contact. Several reports have mentioned methods to overcome these factors separately by performing device modifications.17–27 Due to the low mobility of organic semiconductors and lower lifetime of the photogenerated excitons, the thicknesses of the blend polymers are limited to few nanometre scales. As a consequence, the absorption path length also becomes lower. With the increment of blend polymer thickness, most of the dissociated charges recombine in the active layer, whereas a few are collected at the electrodes as a result of which the PCE value decreases.28–32 In contrast, the cathode buffer layer plays a very significant role in enhancing the PCE of BHJ solar cells by tuning the contact work function, thereby improving the selectivity towards the particular charge carrier.33–35 The combination of a particular buffer layer with a cathode contact helps in increasing the short circuit current density (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc), by changing the built-in-potential generated by the work function difference of the electrodes. This modified built-in-potential helps in driving the charge carriers towards their respective electrodes and finally as a result of which the PCE value increases.36,37 However, by combining the two separate effects, namely, the plasmonic effect of metal NPs and the effect of the cathode buffer layer, the PCE of organic BHJ solar cells can be further enhanced.
Herein, freshly synthesized AuNPs and AgNPs were blended with the PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer and their combined effect was carefully analysed with cathode contacts containing different dual buffer layers with rrP3HT:PC61BM and rrP3HT:PC71BM as blend polymer systems. For the dual cathode buffer layer, we chose two different hole blocking layers, BPhen and BCP, with a LiF/Al cathode contact. It has been observed that for both the blend polymer systems the power conversion efficiency (PCE) increases significantly in the presence of the PEDOT:PSS + AuNPs and PEDOT:PSS + AgNPs with BCP/LiF/Al as a cathode contact compared to the bare PEDOT:PSS layer. In particular, in the presence of PEDOT:PSS + AuNPs and BCP/LiF/Al, the highest PCE was observed for both the blend polymers because of the better band alignment of BCP/LiF/Al with the active layers and the superior surface plasmon resonance of the AuNPs in the visible spectrum compared to AgNPs.

Characterization details
The UV-Visible absorption spectra and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the synthesized metal NPs were characterized using a Jaz UV-Vis spectrophotometer and a Tecnai G2 F20 S-twin JEOL 2100 transmission electron microscope respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were recorded using a Sigma Carl Zeiss scanning electron microscope. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) were recorded using a Xenocs Xeuss 2.0 instrument with a photon energy of 8.04 keV and a sample–detector distance of 177.33 mm for GIWAXS and 2503.3 mm for GISAXS with a grazing incidence angle of 0.18°. The analysis of GIWAXS data was performed using the GIXSGUI software. The steady state PL spectra were recorded using a Fluromax-4 spectrophotometer. Laurell and Spin 150 spin coaters were used for the deposition of metal NP doped PEDOT:PSS as well as the blend polymers on an ITO coated glass substrate. The thicknesses of the films were measured using a Veeco Dektak 150 Surface Profilometer. An Agilent 5500-STM instrument was used for AFM analysis. A Newport Oriel Sol 3A solar simulator and an Oriel IQE-200 instrument were used for solar cell J–V characterization and for the measurement of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of all the fabricated BHJ solar cells. Impedance spectroscopy was recorded using a CH 680 Instrument. Finally, a Keithley-2400 digital source meter was used to measure all the electrical properties of the fabricated devices.
Device fabrication method
For the fabrication of plasmonic BHJ solar cells, the AuNPs and AgNPs were first synthesized by a chemical reduction method. The details of the synthesis technique of the metal NPs and their respective characterization data are given in the Results and discussion section. After synthesizing the metal NPs two separate blend solutions were made with the standard hole injecting layer (HIL), PEDOT:PSS: namely PEDOT:PSS + AuNPs and PEDOT:PSS + AgNPs having a concentration of 20% (v/v). Before the device fabrication we systematically standardized the concentration of the metal NPs in the PEDOT:PSS HIL by measuring the resistance of the device for bare and doped PEDOT:PSS [ESI,† Fig. S1]. After this, the modified hole injecting layers were spin coated at 3000 rpm for 60 seconds on a pre-cleaned, UV-ozone treated ITO coated glass substrate and dried at 120 °C for 30 minutes under an argon atmosphere to improve the hole collection from the polymer to the ITO. The rest of the device fabrication steps are identical to the literature.38 A schematic device representation of a P3HT:PCBM (blend polymer) based plasmonic solar cell with an additional cathode buffer layer is shown in Fig. 1.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of the metal NPs
The metal NPs were freshly prepared by a chemical reduction method using trisodium citrate solution as a reducing and stabilizing agent. All the solutions were prepared in double distilled water. For the synthesis of AuNPs, 50 mL of 10 mM HAuCl4 was heated to boiling using a hot plate with continuous stirring using a controlled magnetic stirrer. This solution was boiled until the temperature reached 100 °C followed by the rapid addition of 1.5% trisodium citrate to this boiling solution with simultaneous stirring. The colour of the solution gradually changed from transparent light yellow to dark black and finally to the characteristic wine red, which indicated the formation of AuNPs. Similarly, for the synthesis of AgNPs, 50 mL of 1 mM AgNO3 was heated to boiling using the hot plate magnetic stirrer. To this solution 5 mL of 1% trisodium citrate was added dropwise. During this process the solution was mixed vigorously and heated until a colour change was evident (yellowish brown). Further, it was removed from the heating element and stirred until it cooled to room temperature. The synthesized metal NPs were characterized by UV-visible spectrophotometry and TEM and FESEM analysis [ESI,† Fig. S2 and S3]. The characteristic surface plasmon resonance peaks of AuNPs and AgNPs were observed at 521 nm and 431 nm, whereas the average particle sizes were found to be ∼10 nm and ∼20 nm respectively.
AFM analysis
It has been observed that the r.m.s. surface roughness of the bare PEDOT:PSS layer was ∼2.61 nm, whereas for PEDOT:PSS + AuNPs and PEDOT:PSS + AgNPs it was ∼2.69 nm and 3.56 nm, respectively (Fig. 2). The distributions of the metal NPs in the PEDOT:PSS layers are shown in the ESI,† Fig. S4. It has been already reported in the literature that the larger size of the metal NPs is always better for enhancing the light scattering and light absorption properties of the BHJ solar cell, which further increase the Jsc value of the cell; as a result, one can achieve higher PCE values.26,27 In this study, it was observed that larger particle size increases the surface roughness (in the ESI,† Fig. S5); as a result, the sizes of AuNPs and AgNPs were optimized to ∼10 nm and ∼20 nm, respectively. Since sizes of these synthesized NPs are very small compared to the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS thin film (∼40 nm) it does not compromise the morphology of the PEDOT:PSS layer. Also as observed from GIWAXS analyses, the crystallinity of the active layers also remains similar in the presence of the metal nanoparticle doped PEDOT:PSS layer like the bare PEDOT:PSS layer (Fig. 3). Hence, both these metal NPs can be added to the hole injecting layer to improve the photoabsorption and light scattering within the organic BHJ solar cell.

From GIWAXS analysis [Fig. 3(a) and (b)], performed using the GIXSGUI software,39–44 three major peaks were observed, among which (100) signified an almost similar lamellar phase of P3HT, which are 1.64 nm (0.3821 Å−1) and 1.65 nm (0.3818 Å−1) for the PC61BM and PC71BM systems on AuNP doped PEDOT:PSS surfaces after 30 min exposure [Fig. 3(c) and (d)]. Both the films possess the edge-on orientation and standard dimensions of P3HT. No significant effect on the crystallinity was observed for both the active layers, which indicates that there are no crystallinity changes occurring in the active layers due to the incorporation of the metal NPs inside the PEDOT:PSS layer, which is also supported by the AFM and electrical performance of the fabricated devices. There is a small difference between the characteristic dimensions obtained from the PCBM amorphous peak, i.e., 1.364 Å−1 (0.46 nm) for PC61BM and 1.316 Å−1 (0.48 nm) for PC71BM, which indicates the change in C-chain length in PCBM. For reference purposes, GIWAXS profiles of P3HT:PC71BM on the PEDOT:PSS + AgNP thin film and AFM images of metal doped PEDOT:PSS layers with both the active blend polymers were also recorded (ESI,† Fig. S6 and S7). The corresponding GISAXS profiles of both the blend polymers with metal NPs are also shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†).42 The AFM images of both the active layers on the NP modified PEDOT:PSS layer recorded post thermal annealing at 150 °C for 10 min showed morphologies with good phase separation.
Photovoltaic characterization
In this work two blend polymer systems namely (i) rrP3HT:PC61BM and (ii) rrP3HT:PC71BM were used for the fabrication of plasmonic BHJ solar cells. For the fabrication of the devices we used bare PEDOT:PSS as a hole injecting layer and two metal NP modified hole injecting layers, viz. PEDOT:PSS + AgNPs and PEDOT:PSS + AuNPs, with two different cathode buffer layers, namely BCP and BPhen.

Fig. 4 shows the schematic representation of the combined effect of plasmonic metal NPs and the dual cathode buffer layer with an rrP3HT:PCBM active layer. The UV-Vis spectra and PL spectra of both the blend polymers on the bare and metal NP doped PEDOT:PSS are also recorded and are shown in the ESI,† Fig. S9 and S10, respectively.

Here BCP/LiF/Al is considered as a dual cathode buffer layer since we obtain much more efficient results in the case of BCP compared to BPhen. The schematic representation of the same with BPhen/LiF/Al as a dual cathode buffer layer with an rrP3HT:PCBM active layer is shown in the ESI,† Fig. S11. The mechanism of both the buffer layers with the metal nanoparticles is almost the same. Along with the band alignment of BCP and BPhen with the active layer, the morphological growth nature of these two cathode buffer layers upon the rrP3HT:PCBM are also different, which created a significant effect on the output performance of BHJ solar cell. For better understanding, the AFM images of BCP and BPhen over rrP3HT:PC61BM and rrP3HT:PC71BM are shown in the ESI,† Fig. S12. It has been observed that among these two additional cathode buffer layers, rrP3HT:PCBM/BPhen [ESI,† Fig. S12(a) and (c)] showed larger grains and higher surface roughness (σr.m.s. = 11.74 nm and 14.88 nm) compared to BCP. It has already been mentioned in several reports that, in the case of organic BHJ solar cells, the high surface roughness of the cathode buffer layer resists the charge transport from the photoactive layer to the cathode contact. This is one of the vital factors due to which the BCP/LiF/Al dual cathode buffer layer shows a higher efficient electrical output with both the blend polymer systems compared to BPhen/LiF/Al.
Here, Fig. 4(a) presents the effect of the dual cathode buffer layer with bare PEDOT:PSS, whereas Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 4(c) present the effect of the same with PEDOT:PSS + AgNPs and PEDOT:PSS + AuNPs respectively. All of the device configurations which were fabricated and analysed in the present study are listed in Table 1. Devices with bare PEDOT:PSS and dual cathode buffer layers were fabricated for reference purposes as reported previously.38

Herein, we have designed in total eighteen different device configurations where the thicknesses of the HIL (∼40 nm) and the blend polymer (∼110 nm) layers were kept identical for all the devices. The thicknesses of the cathode buffer layers, BPhen and BCP, were kept at ∼ 6 nm upon which LiF (∼1 nm)/Al (∼100 nm) conventional cathode contacts were deposited.

Fig. 5 presents the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of all the fabricated devices. From these J–V characteristic graphs, with a bare PEDOT:PSS hole injecting layer [Fig. 5(i–a) and (ii–a)], we observed that by the systematic variation of only the dual cathode buffer layer the PCE (η) value of both the rrP3HT:PC61BM and rrP3HT:PC71BM BHJ solar cells can be improved. In the devices having configuration (3) we found that the maximum value of η = 4.65% with Jsc = 13.6 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.59 V and FF = 61% for the rrP3HT:PC61BM blend polymer, whereas the maximum PCE of the device having configuration (12) fabricated with rrP3HT:PC71BM was observed to be η = 4.96% with Jsc = 13.5 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.59 V and FF = 61%. These highest PCE values obtained in the presence of BCP/LiF/Al as compared to the other dual cathode buffer layers occur due to the better morphology and excellent band alignment of BCP/LiF/Al with both rrP3HT:PC61BM and rrP3HT:PC71BM active layers compared to BPhen/LiF/Al and conventional LiF/Al.38 Also BCP has high selectivity towards electrons due to its high band gap (Eg ∼ 3.5 eV) and deeper HOMO energy level (∼−7 eV) and it can block holes to minimize the charge recombination between the blend polymer–cathode contacts [Fig. 4(a)].

The same phenomenon was also observed when bare PEDOT:PSS was replaced with metal NP incorporated PEDOT:PSS hole injecting layers. Moreover, in the presence of PEDOT:PSS + AgNPs and PEDOT:PSS + AuNPs, better device performances were observed compared to the bare PEDOT:PSS because of the surface plasmon effect which increases the photoabsorption length, scattering and trapping of the incident light that passes through the HIL [Fig. 4(b) and (c)].
The maximum PCE of the devices, having configurations (6) and (15) fabricated with PEDOT:PSS + AgNPs and BCP/LiF/Al cathode contacts, was observed to be η = 4.94% with Jsc = 13.1 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.58 V and FF = 62% for the rrP3HT:PC61BM blend polymer, whereas the maximum PCE of the device having configuration (15) fabricated with rrP3HT:PC71BM was observed to be η = 5.29% with Jsc = 14.7 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.58 V and FF = 61% [Fig. 5(i–b) and (ii–b)]. Further, from Fig. 5(i–c) and (ii–c), we observed that the devices having configurations (9) and (18) fabricated with PEDOT:PSS + AuNPs and BCP/LiF/Al cathode contacts showed maximum η = 4.99% with Jsc = 13.9 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.59 V and FF = 62% for the rrP3HT:PC61BM blend polymer and maximum η = 5.65% with Jsc = 16.1 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.58 V and FF = 61% for the rrP3HT:PC71BM blend polymer. In the case of the metal NP incorporated PEDOT:PSS hole injecting layers we observed that the device with PEDOT:PSS + AuNPs as the HIL and BCP/LiF/Al as the cathode contact showed better device performance compared to the device containing PEDOT:PSS + AgNPs with the same cathode contact since AuNPs have surface plasmon resonance in the visible spectral region (∼531 nm), whereas AgNPs have the same near the UV region (∼421 nm) (ESI,† Fig. S2).45 Thus, initially with the help of the dual cathode buffer layer the PCE of rrP3HT:PC61BM and rrP3HT:PC71BM based BHJ solar cells increased from 3.30% (LiF/Al) to 4.68% (BCP/LiF/Al) and 4.04% (LiF/Al) to 4.96% (BCP/LiF/Al), respectively.
In the second step, using the combined effect of plasmonic AgNP blended PEDOT:PSS and dual cathode buffer layers the PCE value further increased from 3.45% (LiF/Al) to 4.94% (BCP/LiF/Al) for rrP3HT:PC61BM and from 4.05% (LiF/Al) to 5.29% (BCP/LiF/Al) for rrP3HT:PC71BM active layers. Finally, utilizing the PEDOT:PSS + AuNPs and dual cathode buffer layer combination the maximum PCE value for both the blend polymers increased from 3.96% (LiF/Al) to 4.99% (BCP/LiF/Al) for rrP3HT:PC61BM and 4.66% (LiF/Al) to 5.65% (BCP/LiF/Al) for rrP3HT:PC71BM. Moreover, from the dark J–V characteristics of all the fabricated devices no significance changes are observed in the presence of both the metal nanoparticles.
All the device parameters including their average and maximum values were calculated from the J–V characteristics in the presence of bare PEDOT:PSS and both the metal NP blended PEDOT:PSS layers with all the cathode contacts, viz. LiF/Al, BPhen/LiF/Al and BCP/LiF/Al (Table 2).46 The calculated series and shunt resistance (Rs and Rsh) values are summarized in the ESI,† Table S1. Fig. 6 and 7 present the EQE and IQE spectra of all the fabricated devices.47 All the EQE and IQE measurements were done under ambient conditions. From Fig. 6 it was observed that all the devices having BCP/LiF/Al as the cathode contact showed the highest quantum efficiency compared to the other cathode contact in the wavelength range between 300 nm and 700 nm with EQE values over 55%. For rrP3HT:PC61BM with BCP/LiF/Al as the cathode contact the maximum EQE values were 56.3%, 58.6% and 60.2% at 489 nm for bare PEDOT:PSS, PEDOT:PSS + AgNPs and PEDOT:PSS + AuNPs, respectively.

In the case of the rrP3HT:PC71BM blend active layer system with the same cathode contact the observed maximum EQE values for bare PEDOT:PSS, PEDOT:PSS + AgNPs and PEDOT:PSS + AuNPs were 64.2%, 64.47% and 65.6%, respectively, at a wavelength of 470 nm. All the calculated Jsc values extracted from EQE spectra are also listed in Table 2. The estimated IQE spectra of all the devices are presented in Fig. 7.
The observed wide (300–700 nm) and high IQE curves (∼70%) of all the fabricated devices reveal that the morphology of both the blend polymer films deposited on the bare PEDOT:PSS and metal NP blended PEDOT:PSS layers are ideal for the highly efficient BHJ solar cell. These results are in very good agreement with the experimental IQE data where a systematic increment in quantum efficiency in the presence of PEDOT:PSS + AgNPs and PEDOT:PSS + AuNPs compared to the bare PEDOT:PSS system was observed.
To support these experimental data we further recorded the Nyquist plots (Fig. 8) of all the fabricated plasmonic BHJ solar cells. Generally, from the diameter of the semicircle of Nyquist plot the shunt resistance of the fabricated devices under their test conditions can be determined. Herein, we observed that the BCP/LiF/Al contact had the largest shunt resistance as compared with the other contact, except the device having configuration (18), due to the lower FF and higher Jsc values compared to BPhen/LiF/Al due to the presence of AuNPs.

In the literature, different approaches have been used to improve the efficiency of BHJ solar cells by incorporating different molecular modifications and device engineering. Modification of cathode contacts by inserting functional buffer layers is one of the efficient approaches among them. Recently, it has also been reported that incorporation of metallic NPs into various layers of the device architecture was an additional technique for improving the PCE of BHJ solar cells because of their strong interacting nature with solar photons. In particular, AuNPs and AgNPs have immense potential to be incorporated in the fabrication of BHJ solar cells since gold has less oxidation effect, whereas silver is cost effective compared to other metals. Table 3 provides a summary of recent data on P3HT:PCBM based bulk heterojunction solar cells having different device architecture modifications in cathode buffer layers and incorporation of metallic NPs into various layers of BHJ solar cells for achieving efficient device performance.48–62 The dispersion of AuNPs and AgNPs in the PEDOT:PSS layer is comparatively easy and straightforward. PEDOT:PSS can be dispersed in aqueous medium; therefore, the AuNPs and AgNPs synthesized by the chemical reduction method can be easily mixed with PEDOT:PSS without any chemical functionalization. In this regard, without using a stabilizer, NaBH4-based AuNPs synthesized directly in PEDOT:PSS increase the PCE value up to 3.19% of P3HT:PCBM-based solar cells with LiF/Al as a cathode contact.54 It has been found that the size of the metal NPs can also strongly affect the efficiency of BHJ solar cells. AuNPs with 50 nm size doped into the PEDOT:PSS layer increase the efficiency of the P3HT:PCBM based solar cell from 3.57% to 4.24%.55 Again, the combination of Au–Ag alloy NPs in the active layer further increases the PCE value of the P3HT:PCBM based solar cell with Ca/Al as a cathode contact up to 4.73%.60 Yet, to the best of our knowledge, the maximum PCE value of the P3HT:PCBM solar cell reported with bare PEDOT:PSS and a BCP/Al cathode contact is 4.11%.51

In this study, we have successfully improved the PCE value of both the rrP3HT:PC61BM and rrP3HT:PC71BM based solar cells by the collective effect of the plasmonic metal NPs and the dual cathode buffer layer. Two different types of metal NPs, namely AgNPs and AuNPs, are blended separately in the PEDOT:PSS hole transport layer. For the dual cathode buffer layer, we chose two different hole blocking layers, BPhen and BCP, with LiF/Al conventional blocking layers, BPhen and BCP, with the LiF/Al conventional cathode contact. For both the blend polymer systems the observed PCE increases significantly in the presence of PEDOT:PSS + AuNPs and PEDOT:PSS + AgNPs with BCP/LiF/Al as the cathode contact because of better band alignment of the dual cathode buffer layers with the active layers and the superior surface plasmonic effect of the metallic NPs. We observed the best device performance in the presence of AuNPs because of their surface plasmon resonance in the visible region. The results demonstrated here successfully explain the role of metal NP modified PEDOT:PSS layers with different dual cathode buffer layers and their contribution to the overall device performance. Moreover, this study introduced a very easy and simple technique for the fabrication of highly efficient organic BHJ solar cells based on rrP3HT:PC61BM and rrP3HT:PC71BM with a PCE close to 6%, a value which can be further improved by engineering the device architecture and by using preferential additives.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrated the combined influence of different dual cathode buffer layers with two different metal NPs on the performance of rrP3HT:PC61BM and rrP3HT:PC71BM-based bulk heterojunction solar cells. Both the metal NPs, i.e. AuNPs and AgNPs, that were utilized for device fabrication were freshly synthesized by a chemical reduction method with trisodium citrate as a reducing and stabilizing agent. The significance of both the NP containing PEDOT:PSS layers on the device performance is justified by their remarkable performances and these results were compared with the conventional device architecture. It was established that the device comprising PEDOT:PSS + AuNPs with a BCP/LiF/Al cathode contact showed the best device performance, i.e. η = 5.65% with Jsc = 16.1 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.58 V and FF = 61% for rrP3HT:PC71BM and η = 4.99% with Jsc = 13.9 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.59 V and FF = 62% for rrP3HT:PC61BM compared to the PEDOT:PSS + AgNP and bare PEDOT:PSS device architectures with the same dual cathode contact. This PEDOT:PSS + AuNPs with BCP/LiF/Al device architecture showed better results compared to all the other devices reported here due to the simultaneous effect of AuNPs which improves the absorption length by scattering of incident solar photons and the BCP/LiF dual cathode buffer layer that can block more holes to minimize the charge recombination between the blend polymer–cathode contacts. Overall, in this study we could successfully demonstrate a very simple and easy fabrication technique to achieve highly efficient organic BHJ solar cells by combining the two effects simultaneously.
