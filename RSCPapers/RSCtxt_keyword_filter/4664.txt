The counter electrode (CE) is an essential component in DSSCs, and plays a crucial role in catalyzing Co3+ ion reduction in Co-based DSSCs. In this mini-review, we review recent developments in CE materials for Co-mediated DSSCs including: noble metal platinum (Pt), carbon materials, transition metal compounds (TMCs), polymers, and their corresponding hybrids, highlighting important contributions worldwide that promise low cost, efficient, and robust Co-mediated DSSC systems. Additionally, the crucial challenges associated with employing these low-cost CE catalysts for Co-based redox couples in DSSCs are stressed.Sining YunSining Yun is a Professor in the School of Materials & Mineral Resources at Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology (XAUAT) in China.

1. Introduction
Solar energy, as a clean and renewable energy source, has unparalleled advantages over other energy production methods. In 1991, Grätzel et al. developed a new photochemical solar cell using dye-sensitization on TiO2 mesostructured layers, resulting in the development of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).1 Due to their advantages including low cost, choice of color, light weight, packing technology, environmentally friendly materials, and acceptable photoelectric conversion efficiency, DSSCs are considered to be a promising photovoltaic technology.
Early DSSCs consisted of a TiO2 photoanode, a CE and an electrolyte solution containing an iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox shuttle. It is well known that the photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs, such as open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) are closely related to the electrolyte solution.2 An impressive PCE of 11% has been achieved by the use of the I−/I3− redox shuttle in DSSCs.3 However, the I−/I3− electrolyte solution suffers from several problems, for instance, a significant loss in Jsc and Voc, the corrosion of Pt CEs and absorption of visible light.4–7 Meanwhile, the oxidation potential based on the I−/I3− redox shuttle (E0(I−/I3−)) was assumed to be 0.35 V vs. the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE), and the dye oxidation potential was mostly 1.0 V vs. SHE. The relatively negative redox potential based on the I−/I3− redox shuttle limited the Voc and the PCE of the device.8
To overcome these issues, Co2+/Co3+, SeCN−/(SeCN), SCN−/(SCN)2, Br−/Br3−, and disulfide/thiolate have been investigated as alternative redox shuttles for DSSCs.9–16 Among them, the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles have attracted the most attention due to their unparalleled merits including higher redox potential and the reduced corrosiveness towards metallic conductors. In addition, when employing Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles in the wavelength range of 440 nm–620 nm, photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values similar to those of the I−/I3− redox system are achieved, and DSSCs assembled with the cyclopentadithiophene-bridged donor–acceptor dye (Y123) with Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles have an enhanced photocurrent response in the 390 nm–480 nm range due to the lower molar absorption coefficients of Co2+/Co3+ in the blue spectral region, as seen in Fig. 1(a). These resulted in a higher Voc value and an increase in overall PCE (Fig. 1(b)). Particularly, at lower light intensities, the higher PCE values were measured based on the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles.9,10,17–19 The devices fabricated using an organic dye (SM315) in conjunction with a tris(2,2′-bipyridine) Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles produced a remarkable PCE of 13.0%, which remains the benchmark PCE value for liquid electrolyte solution DSSCs.20 However, some issues still limit the efficiency of Co-mediated DSSCs. The larger size of the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles, for instance, results in lower ion mobility and thus limits mass transport. In addition, the inefficient charge transfer of the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles at the CE also limits the PCE.21,22

The CE has played a crucial role in the work process of DSSC technologies. The function of the CE is to collect electrons from the external circuit and to reduce the Co3+ ion in the electrolyte solution. In the DSSC system, the CE materials should possess high catalytic activity and electrical conductivity. Carbon materials, transition metal compounds (TMCs), conductive polymers, and hybrids have been tested as alternatives to the Pt CE in I-mediated DSSCs.2,15,24–27 However, in-depth analysis and a fundamental understanding of the underlying principles of CE design and operation for Co-mediated DSSCs are lacking in the previous review, which limits the systematic implementation of optimized parameters. Moreover, the rapid increase in research in this area has resulted in an abundance of the literature; the implications of these recent developments need to be communicated to the wider scientific community to stimulate further progress. A full understanding of the operational principles in a CE of Co-mediated DSSCs is very important for designing new CEs with improved catalytic activity and stability. In this mini-review, we discuss various kinds of CEs for the Co-mediated DSSC system, including Pt, carbon materials, TMCs, conductive polymers and hybrids. The advantages and disadvantages of the alternative Pt catalyst are highlighted. Furthermore, the challenges of the high-performance and low-cost Pt-free CEs in Co-mediated DSSCs are also discussed.
2. Working principles of counter electrodes
2.1. Co-mediators with various ligands
Compared with the conventional I−/I3− redox shuttle, the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles can be molecularly designed with various ligands such as bipyridine-, terpyridine- and phenanthroline.10,28 The structures of the various alternative Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles used in DSSCs are shown in Fig. 2.29 By changing the ligands, the electrochemical and physical properties of the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles can be easily tuned. The introduction of electron-withdrawing groups on the ligands can increase the redox potential of the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles, thereby increasing Voc and PCE. Additionally, the large volume of the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles allow for many catalytically active positions on the non-Pt catalyst surface to be provided, which improves catalytic activity.12 However, the large volume of the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles lead to difficulties in the diffusion of ions.

2.2. Operational principles of Co-based DSSCs
A schematic drawing of a DSSC based on Co-mediated system is shown in Fig. 3. The electrolyte solution in a DSSC system contains Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles dissolved in an organic solvent. First, the Co3+ ion is absorbed on the surface of the CE (eqn (1)). Under illumination, the dye experiences an electronic excitation from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), and a sensitizer molecule is excited.25 Meanwhile, a photoelectron is released and injected into the conduction band of the semiconductor, leaving the dye in an oxidized state. Second, the electrons flow from the photoanode to the external load and are then collected at the CE surface. The electrolyte solution is responsible for the regeneration of the oxidized dye by Co3+ reduction. The oxidized dye is restored to its original state by electron transfer from the electrolyte solution. The charge transfer reaction was catalyzed by the CE materials. In addition, the electrolyte solution acts as an electron donor. During the process of a regenerative cycle in the DSSC system, the Co3+ reduction to Co2+ takes place on the surface of the CE, which is significant for the PCE of DSSCs (eqn (2)).28 Finally, the Co2+ molecule diffuses from the CE to the electrolyte solution (eqn (3)). Co3+ + CE → Co3+ (CE)(1) Co3+ (CE) + e− → Co2+ (CE)(2) Co2+ (CE) → Co2+(3)

The CE strongly influences the fill factor (FF) and subsequently the PCE of the devices. The CE must be catalytically active for the reaction and to reduce the overpotential, which drives the reaction at a certain current density.30 For this purpose, the CE should have low resistance and a high electrocatalytic activity so that the electrode reaction maintains a low over voltage and energy loss in the DSSCs.31 Moreover, CEs with a higher specific surface area not only provide more catalytic sites for Co3+ reduction, but are also favorable for the regeneration of the sensitizer. The CE should be selected and designed to maximize these synergistic effects in the DSSCs.
3. Counter electrodes (CEs) of Co-mediated DSSCs
3.1. Pt CE
To date, Pt has been recognized as a preferred CE material in I-mediated DSSCs. Pt nanoparticles have several superior properties, such as high surface area, high transmittance, low charge transfer resistance (Rct), and high electrical conductivity. The high surface area of the Pt nanoparticles provides for a large number of active sites available for the redox shuttle, which increases the current density.25,32,33
During the past several decades, many studies have focused on platinized electrodes in conjunction with Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles in DSSCs. The platinized electrode in Co-mediated DSSCs employing a Y123 sensitizer had better performance, as seen in Fig. 4(a), and the values of Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE were 901 mV, 15.2 mA cm−2, 0.66, and 9.0%, respectively.34,35 Meanwhile, an efficient DSSC based on [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+, [Co(dmb)3]2+/3+ and [Co(dtb)3]2+/3+ redox shuttles was reported.19Fig. 4(b) shows the IPCE for DSSCs sensitized with a synergistic D–π-A organic sensitizer (D35). In the 360 nm–460 nm spectral range, the IPCE for the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles was higher than that for the I−/I3− redox shuttle. In the case where the DSSC is illuminated from the CE side, instead of the working electrode, the effect is even more distinct. Among the different redox shuttles employed, the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ in combination with the D35 dye gave the highest efficiency of 6.7%, as seen in Fig. 4(c). The redox potential of the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ (0.56 V vs. SHE) was higher than that of the I−/I3− redox shuttle, which derived the recombination between electrons in the conduction band of the TiO2 and Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles in the electrolyte solution. However, fast recombination appeared to be limited when used in combination with D35. Due to a decreased amount of adsorbed Li cations at the TiO2 surface leading to a negative shift in the conduction band, the high Voc based on the two redox shuttles was achieved. For the [Co(bpy)3]2+/3+ redox shuttle, the insulating effect of the alkoxyl groups and the more positive potential of the Co-based redox shuttles led to remarkably higher Voc (0.88 V). Additionally, the use of a one-electron Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttle with a more positive redox potential than the I−/I3− redox shuttle was found to achieve higher dark current densities.

In 2011, using a zinc porphyrin dye (YD2-o-C8), which has excellent light-harvesting properties, as a sensitizer, M. Grätzel et al. compared the tris(2,2′-bipyridine) Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles with the I−/I3− redox shuttle. The PCE values based on the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles increased from 7.6% to 11.9%. Further, when using YD2-o-C8 and Y123 in Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles, Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE were found to achieve notable values of 935 mV, 17.66 mA cm−2, 0.74, and 12.3%, respectively.36 These remarkable results indicated that the co-sensitizer had well-aligned energy levels with the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles. The lower rate of electron recapture by the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles for the YD2-o-C8-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 films exhibits very high Voc. By introducing a complementary absorption spectrum to YD2-o-C8, this co-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 film showed an impressive panchromatic photocurrent response in the visible range and the more than 90% of IPCE was recorded in a large wavelength domain below 700 nm.
However, Pt has disadvantages due to its high cost and limited availability. Additionally, Pt can dissolve in the I−/I3− redox shuttle electrolyte solution to produce some species, such as PtI4.37 Although Pt is very effective for catalyzing I3− reduction, it is less effective in the Co-based redox system.7,38 On the other hand, because the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles contain various ligands that can influence the electrochemical characteristics, the use of Pt in Co-mediated DSSCs remains controversial.10,24 In this context, low cost Pt-free materials, such as carbon materials, TMCs, conductive polymers, and hybrids have been proposed to replace the Pt catalysts. The detailed photovoltaic parameters of Co-mediated DSSCs with various CEs and dyes are summarized in Table 1.

3.2. Carbon materials
Due to the good chemical stability, electrical conductivity and catalytic activity of carbon materials, they were ideal candidates for replacing Pt in DSSCs. As early as 1996, graphite and carbon black (Cb) were used as the CE materials in the I−/I3− redox system and obtained a PCE of 6.7%.56 Meanwhile, carbon materials used in Co-mediated DSSCs can exhibit better performance. The ordered mesoporous carbon and active carbon (Ca) were investigated as CE materials, and achieved PCEs of 4.05% and 3.43%, respectively.12 In addition, because of their high conductivity, good catalytic functions and excellent flexibility, the single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) CEs in Co-mediated DSSCs achieved excellent performance.39 By comparison of the J–V curves with different CEs in Fig. 5 for the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttle electrolyte solution, it can be seen that the PCE of the SWCNT plastic CE was 3.6%, which is close to the PCE of DSSCs with sputtered Pt on indium tin oxide-plain polyethylene terephthalate (ITO/PET) (3.8%).

The graphene nanoplatelet (GNP) is a very promising alternative CE material. Recently, an FTO-supported GNP CE was synthesized to be active for the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox shuttles with a molecularly engineered porphyrin sensitizer (SM315), and achieved a maximum PCE of 13.0%.20 Compared to the green sensitizer (SM371), the sensitizer SM315 achieved the high IPCE value of 80% in the wavelength range from 450 nm to 750 nm in Fig. 6(a), implying higher light capture efficiency of DSSCs. Fig. 6(b) shows the J–V curve of DSSCs with dyes SM371 and SM315. Although the Voc of 0.91 V was slightly lower, the device with sensitizer SM315 attained a higher Jsc (18.1 mA cm−2) and PCE of 13.0%, thereby outperforming SM371 as a result of the improvement in visible and near-infrared light harvesting.

Meanwhile, GNP could outperform Pt for Co-mediated DSSCs both in Rct and in electrochemical stability.34,35,45,57 The J–V curves of Co(bpy)3-mediated DSSCs with GNP-FTO and Pt-FTO CEs are shown in Fig. 7(a). At higher illumination intensity, the GNP-FTO CE exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity and PCE compared to the Pt-FTO CE. Values of 878 mV, 14.8 mA cm−2, 0.72, and 9.4% have been achieved for Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE, respectively (see Table 1). Fig. 7(b) shows J–V characteristics of DSSCs using GNP-FTO CEs based on Co(L)2 redox shuttles, where L is 6-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-2,2′-bipyridine, under various simulated solar irradiation conditions. Interestingly, the investigation for Co-mediated systems shows that the dark current near Voc is always enhanced compared with that of the GNP-FTO CE. A possible reason for this is that the dark current is not controlled by the electron flow at the CE, but by the electron flow from the nanocrystalline TiO2 film into the redox electrolyte solution.

Functionalized graphene sheet (FGS) has a large surface area like other carbon materials, and the FGS has lattice defects and oxygen-containing functional groups, which are favorable characteristics for replacing Pt as a catalyst.46,58–60 The new synthetic FGS with high surface area was used as a CE for Co-mediated DSSCs. In view of the photovoltaic performance and EIS fitting data, the Rct of the CEs is a major factor for the performance of DSSCs. The impedance results for FGS CE using different electrolyte solutions with I-, Co-, and S-based mediators are summarized in Fig. 8(a). The FGS CE employing Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles showed lower effective Rct (<1 Ω cm2), exhibiting higher catalytic activity for Co2+/Co3+ reduction. The J–V curves of DSSCs using the two types of CEs, seen in Fig. 8(b), show that FGS CE performs better than the platinized electrode.

L. Kavan et al. reported that graphene oxide after heat treatment at 450 °C under an Ar atmosphere (GO-HT) and reduction graphene oxide (RGO) achieve better mechanical and electrochemical stability than pure graphene nanoplatelets. The PCEs of GO-HT and RGO were 8.8% and 8.4%, respectively.34,57 The parameters of the GO-HT CE are promising on account of the J–V characteristics of GO-HT CE for DSSCs, as seen in Fig. 9. The corresponding Rct value of GO-HT (0.51 Ω cm2) was smaller than that of RGO (3.4 Ω cm2). It is likely that electrocatalytic activity of GO-HT and RGO is correlated with the density of dangling bonds, step edges, and other sharp atomic features, but this requires further investigation.

The shortcomings of carbon materials, such as opacity and poor adhesion between the carbon film and the substrate, limited their practical applications. The poor mechanical stability of traditional carbon CEs was unfavorable for long-term use. Through the introduction of graphene oxide as a surfactant in a recent study, the adhesion between the GNP film and the substrate was shown to be significantly enhanced.24,34
3.3. Transition metal compounds (TMCs)
Recently, TMCs exhibiting Pt-like catalytic behavior have attracted considerable attention due to their low cost, high electrocatalytic activity, and stability.62,63 Ma et al. investigated TMCs, such as oxides, carbides, and nitrides of some elements including Ti, W, Nb, Cr, V, Mo and Zr, and sulphides (WS2 and MoS2), as CE materials in DSSCs.2,64,65 Meanwhile, our group have also studied TMCs such as HfO2, TaO, Ta2O5, SiC, Ta4C3, Ta3N5, TaO/MC (MC = mesoporous carbon), TaC/MC, HfO2/MGC (MGC represents mesoporous graphitic carbon), HfO2/C, Hf7O8N4/HfO2/C and Pt/SiC.24,66–72 In the I−/I3− system, NbO2, WO2, and TaO exhibited outstanding performance and achieved higher PCEs of 7.88%, 7.25%, and 6.48%, respectively. Recently, researchers have begun to focus on NbO2 and TiC as CEs for Co-mediated DSSCs.12 As shown in Fig. 10, the DSSCs with TiC CE showed Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE of 640 mV, 9.77 mA cm−2, 0.66, and 4.13% respectively. Compared with platinized electrodes, the TiC CE showed a smaller Rct of 0.7 Ω cm2, which is mainly due to the larger surface area of TiC CE, which provides more catalytic sites for Co3+ ion reduction. Furthermore, the NbO2 CE exhibited the same characteristics as the TiC CE, with the former achieving values for Voc, Jsc and FF of 0.61 V, 9.14 mA cm−2, and 0.65, respectively. It seems from Table 1 that TMCs cannot match as well with Co-mediated redox shuttles as with I-mediated redox shuttle.

Ta3N5, TaON, Co0.85Se and CoS were also used as alternatives to Pt in conjunction with Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles.40,48–50 The Ta3N5 nanorods have a relatively high crystallinity, shown in Fig. 11(a). The drop-casted Ta3N5 films on FTO substrates, Fig. 11(b), showed that the surface of the Ta3N5 nanorods film has a rich internal porous structure, which provides more catalytic sites for the reduction of the Co3+ ion. However, compared with the FF (0.685) of Pt, the lower FF (0.316) of Ta3N5 nanorods led to the lower PCE of 2.89%. In addition, due to Ta5+ exhibiting noble-metal-like electron features, the Ta3N5 showed similar performance to a typical platinized electrode. Thus, the TaON, having similar properties with Ta3N5, obtained lower a PCE of 2.54%.

In conjunction with the high absorption coefficient of organic dyes (C218), CoS CE can be used as a promising alternative to platinized electrodes for DSSCs based on the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles. The SEM image of CoS shows a honeycomb-like surface structure with better interconnectivity as seen in Fig. 11(c). This structure led to a Jsc of 12.84 mA cm−2, a Voc of 805 mV and a PCE of 6.72%. The PCE of CoS CE was comparable to the performance of the platinized electrode (6.94%). In addition, bimetallic alloys also can be used as alternatives to platinized electrodes. The Co0.85Se, with a highly uniform honeycomb-like structure (Fig. 11(d)) provided a greater surface area and more catalytic sites; however, a PCE of only 1.57% was obtained, which indicated that the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs using Co0.85Se CEs requires further improvement.
Tungsten oxides with notable catalytic properties are efficient catalysts in DSSCs for Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles. In particular, the electrocatalytic properties of W18O49 with surface oxygen vacancies (W–OV–W) were investigated.41 SEM images of W–OV–W and schematic surface oxygen vacancies filling W18O49 (W–O–W) are shown in Fig. 12(a) and (b). The W–OV–W exhibited a richly porous and loose structure, which allowed the electrolyte solution to fill the pores and played a crucial role in the catalytic reactions. The J–V curves obtained for these DSSCs based on W–OV–W, W–O–W and platinized electrodes are shown in Fig. 12(c). It is clear that the catalytic performance of CEs comprised of W18O49 nanowires for Co-mediated DSSCs have a comparable performance to that of platinized electrodes.

Most of the TMC materials exhibited Pt-like catalytic activity; however, the synthesis procedures of TMCs do not allow for the control of the morphology, which limits the commercial applications of DSSCs going forward.
3.4. Conductive polymers
Compared with other materials, conductive polymers have unique properties of transparency and flexibility, and as a result they can be developed into flexible and transparent electrodes. In addition, conductive polymers have several other advantages such as low cost, good conductivity, and high catalytic activity.15 In the recent past, based on these characteristics, conducting polymers, such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT), polyaniline (PANI) and poly(3,4-propylenedioxythiophene) (PProDOT), as alternative CEs have been applied in Co-mediated DSSCs. A PProDOT layer with high surface area was reported.23 The notably lower Rct of 2.5 Ω cm2 significantly improved the FF (0.77), hence a higher PCE of 10.08% was obtained.
Meanwhile, the implementation of PEDOT in Co-mediated DSSCs systems has attracted the interest of researchers. M. Grätzel et al. used PEDOT as a CE in DSSCs based on two Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles, namely Co2+/Co3+ tris(2,2′-bipyridine) (Co(bpy)3) and Co2+/Co3+ tris(1,1′-phenanthroline) (Co(phen)3).51 The porous morphology of the PEDOT layer, seen in Fig. 13(a), reduced the diffusion distance of the electrolyte solution, which resulted in a decrease of Rct and better Co3+ ion reduction. The J–V characteristics of DSSCs based on the PEDOT films and platinized electrodes for two Co-based redox shuttles are shown in Fig. 13(b), in which the Co-mediated DSSCs with PEDOT CE achieved significant values for Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE of 910 mV, 15.9 mA cm−2, 0.71, and 10.3%, respectively. The improved FF for both electrolyte solutions suggests a lower Rct of the PEDOT film, attributed to its high surface area. In addition, the decrease of Rct resulted in an increase of Jsc, thus achieving a competitive PCE.

PEDOT as such is an insoluble polymer. Thus to make its solution processable, the commercial product polystyrenesulfonate doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT:PSS) is used. However, PEDOT:PSS is an aqueous dispersion and has some drawbacks. One possibility for obtaining PEDOT is the electrodeposition of EDOT, which will also allow for the deposition of uniform films directly onto any conductive substrate, including FTO substrates. Varying thicknesses of PEDOT were used as CEs in Co-mediated DSSCs employing an organic dye (LEG4).52 As illustrated in Fig. 14(a), the J–V curves of the Co-mediated DSSCs with three different thicknesses of CE materials are presented; the thinnest PEDOT layer of 270 nm attained the highest PCE of 6.3%. The values of Voc, Jsc and FF were 865 mV, 10.7 mA cm−2, and 0.70, respectively. The higher PCE values of DSSCs with PEDOT CEs can be attributed to the higher FF and much lower Rct (0.2 Ω cm2) as compared with platinized electrodes (5.3%). Meanwhile, the PEDOT CEs with lower series resistance (Rs), compared to the platinized electrode indicated that the PEDOT CEs have better conductive charge transfer properties in the DSSCs. The SEM images of the PEDOT samples (270 nm) are shown in Fig. 14b. The high-surface area of the PEDOT films with an open mesoporous structure leads to an increase in the catalytic activity.

The PEDOT and other polymers are used for CEs films in DSSCs assembled with [Co(bpy–pz)2](PF6)2 and [Co(bpy–pz)2](PF6)3 redox shuttles, in which the PEDOT film obtained significant PCE values as high as 8.26%.29 The high performance of PEDOT-based CEs was attributed to a perfect match between the oxidation potential of the dye and the redox shuttle. The chemical structures of the monomer used can be seen in Fig. 15(a). The SEM image of PProDOT synthesized in an ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (BMITFSI) illustrates the compact granular porous structures with high surface areas (Fig. 15(b)), which are desired qualities for electrocatalysis and produce significant benefits for Co3+ ion reduction. Under the same conditions, compared with platinized electrodes, the photovoltaic performances of Co-mediated DSSCs with PProDOT using the [Co(bpy–pz)2](PF6)2 and [Co(bpy–pz)2](PF6)3 redox shuttles showed remarkable values of Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE which were 12.6 mA cm−2, 1000 mV, 0.78, and 9.9%, respectively. The PProDOT film achieved broad IPCE values at 450 nm–650 nm (Fig. 15(c)). In all of the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles, the PProDOT film exhibited enhanced Voc over platinized electrodes. Moreover, PProDOT synthesized in the ionic liquids 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate (EMIFAP), 3,4-(2′,2′-dimethylpropylene)-dioxythiophene (Me2-PProDOT) and 3,4-(2′,2′-diethylpropylene)-dioxythiophene (Et2-PProDOT) were also investigated and achieved prominent PCEs of 8.7%, 8.74%, 8.0%, respectively, in the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttle systems (Table 1).

The oriented PANI nanowire prepared by in situ growth was interesting and has been investigated as a CE in Co-mediated DSSCs.42 The oriented PANI nanowire CE showed high uniformity and achieved a PCE of 8.24%, which was higher than that obtained by either a drop-cast PANI (5.97%) having a random network-like structure (Fig. 16(a)) or platinized electrode (6.78%) under the same conditions. Compared with the PANI random network and Pt, the lowest Rct of the PANI nanowire represents the best catalytic performance. The J–V curves of Co-mediated DSSCs with PANI nanowires and PANI random network are shown in Fig. 16(b). The significant values of Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE for PANI nanowire CE were 780 mV, 15.09 mA cm−2, 0.7, and 8.24%, respectively. Meanwhile, the PANI nanowire CE showed higher IPCE values (Fig. 16(c)), and the maximum IPCE of 87% was obtained at 440 nm. The PANI-based nanowire was found to be a good alternative material to replace the expensive Pt as the CE of DSSCs.

Although the performance of DSSCs using conducting polymer CEs is impressive, the complex fabrication and poor stability of these polymer CEs have limited their practical application.
3.5. Hybrids
Hybrid CEs in DSSCs have become increasingly popular due to the synergetic effects derived from the different components of the hybrids.24 In other words, all of the excellent qualities of the component materials are combined into one material. Here, we provide a summary of the hybrid CEs based on Co-mediated DSSCs.
Due to their large surface area and high conductivity, carbon materials were found to be excellent components for hybrid CEs. By optimizing the proportions between graphene oxide (GO) and GNP to improve their catalytic properties, Kavan et al. investigated hybrids of GO/GNP as CEs in DSSCs.34 The catalytic activity of GNP-based materials is related to the amount of oxygen in the carbon skeleton. The optimized GONP50 (the amounts of GO, T550 = 90%) CE showed the lowest Rct, significantly enhancing its catalytic activity, and also had remarkable values of Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE of 885 mV, 15.6 mA cm−2, 0.67, and 9.3%. Due to the intimate interaction of hydrophilic functionalities between GO and the FTO surface, the GO/GNP films have strong adhesion to the FTO substrate. Aside from GO, carbon was regarded as a component of hybrid CEs. A new type of carbon/graphene hybrid was reported as a CE material. Compared with the GNP films, the carbon/graphene hybrids presented enhanced catalytic performance and improved adhesion to the FTO substrate via a conductive carbon matrix, yielding significant values of Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE were 865 mV, 14.3 mA cm−2, 0.74, and 9.11%, respectively.53 The carbon/graphene used as CEs had lower Rct, enhanced FF, and high PCE values for Co-mediated DSSCs as compared to platinized electrodes. In addition, nanohybrid carbon/graphene showed an almost identical dark current compared to that of the Pt based CE, which may be associated with the improved adhesion of the catalyst particles.
Carbon material can be introduced into the hybrid CEs, along with metal material which is also a prominent component of hybrids. GNP loaded on the surface of silver nanowire (Ag-NW) films can be used as a catalytic CE in Co-mediator DSSCs, and this combination results in a remarkable improvement of electrocatalytic properties.54 The schematic diagram of Ag-NW and Ag-NW/GNP-based CEs and a cross-sectional tilted view of the Ag-NW/GNP film are shown in Fig. 17. The GNP layer provides a larger interfacial surface area with the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles. Moreover, the Ag-NW/GNP showed a lower Rct value of 11.57 Ω cm2, indicating higher electrocatalytic activity than that of Ag-NW (47.73 Ω cm2). The values of Voc, Jsc, and FF for the Ag-NW/GNP CEs were 550 mV, 6.45 mA cm−2, and 0.52, respectively. The PCE of Ag-NW/GNP (1.61%) is lower than that of Pt (1.87%).

The RGO/Ta3N5 hybrids, fabricated by mixing graphene oxide with pre-synthesized Ta3N5 nanorods, were also used as CE materials in Co-mediated DSSCs. The SEM image of RGO/Ta3N5, as shown in Fig. 18(a), shows Ta3N5 nanorods with a great deal of corrugation embedded into the RGO sheets. The specific surface areas of the RGO/Ta3N5 hybrids were 57.6 m2 g−1, higher than those of Ta3N5 (39.8 m2 g−1) and RGO (12.3 m2 g−1). The lattice surface defects of RGO are beneficial for improving the electrical performance. Meanwhile, the network structure of RGO is able to provide high electrical conductivity. With the synergetic catalytic effect of RGO and Ta3N5 nanorods, the RGO/Ta3N5 hybrids exhibited comparable electrocatalytic performance for the reduction of Co3+ and better electrocatalytic stability in Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles compared with Pt; the RGO/Ta3N5 hybrids were able to achieve the remarkable PCE of 7.85%.40 The J–V curves of the DSSCs using RGO/Ta3N5, RGO, Ta3N5 nanorods and Pt as CEs are shown in Fig. 18(b). It is obvious that all of the photovoltaic parameters based on RGO/Ta3N5 were higher than those of the DSSCs using RGO or Ta3N5 nanorods.

Interestingly, the hybrids of TaON nanoparticles embedded in the RGO sheets were also reported by their group.48Fig. 18(c) shows the SEM images of the drop-casted RGO/TaON and RGO films and the electron-transport network structure of RGO/TaON nanohybrids, which can be advantageous for Co3+ ion reduction. Compared with RGO and TaON, the specific surface area of the RGO/TaON hybrids had higher values of 54.3 m2 g−1. The total current of the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttle reaction was increased, which led to higher values of Jsc and Voc. The J–V curves of DSSCs using TaON, RGO, RGO/TaON and Pt as CEs are shown in Fig. 18(d) (also see Table 1). The improved performances of the RGO/TaON hybrids resulted from the synergistic effect of RGO and TaON.
Furthermore, the hybrids of TMCs and conductive polymers can also be used as CEs for DSSCs. In a report, TiC/PEDOT and TiN/PEDOT nanohybrids synthesized by electrochemical deposition were developed as alternative catalysts in a Co-mediator system.55Fig. 19(a) and (b) show SEM images of similar morphologies for two nanohybrids. The authors found that the PEDOT was distributed uniformly throughout the film and wraps firmly over the TiN particles. As a conductive binder, the PEDOT enhanced the adhesion between the nanoparticles and the substrate. The TiC and TiN layer provided a porous structure for the PEDOT to increase its active surface area. Based on the J–V curves of the Co-mediated DSSCs of the different CEs (Fig. 19(c)), the photovoltaic performance of the two nanohybrids was better than that of the Pt. The platinized electrode achieved a Voc of 877 mV, a Jsc of 11.26 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.75, and a PCE of 7.51%. For the TiN/PEDOT CE, excellent performance was observed with Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE values of 840 mV, 13.21 mA cm−2, 0.75 and 8.26%, respectively. Meanwhile, the TiC/PEDOT CE also exhibited significant performance parameters values (Table 1). The higher Jsc of the hybrid CEs compared to that of the plain PEDOT film is attributed to the larger active surface area of the hybrids. In addition, the Rct values of the two kinds of hybrids (<1 Ω cm2) indicated higher electrocatalytic activity than for Pt.

It is noted that the nanostructure hybrid catalysts with TMCs contribute to the Co3+ ion reduction reaction. In this context, Co0.85Se/Ni0.85Se nanohybrid films were synthesized on FTO substrates.49 As a result of the synergistic effects and the unique morphology of the Co0.85Se/Ni0.85Se nanoparticles embedded with 2D nanoflakes, the Co-mediated DSSCs with Co0.85Se/Ni0.85Se CE achieved a higher PCE of 2.54%: an improvement of 46% compared with the Pt (1.74%) under the same conditions. In addition, the Co0.85Se/Ni0.85Se had a much smaller Rct value of 7.39 Ω cm2, indicating a higher electrocatalytic activity for Co3+ reduction.
While hybrid materials as alternative CEs have many advantages, their poor adhesion to the conductive substrate limits their use in applications. Meanwhile, hybrid materials exhibit excellent performance in Co-mediated DSSCs due to their synergetic effects; nevertheless, the theoretical explanation is still unclear and some effort should be paid to this field to improve applications of Co-mediated DSSCs.
4. Cobalt-based tandem-redox electrolyte solution
In 2010, to solve these problems of inefficient charge transfer and the lower ion mobility of Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles, Caramori et al. investigated a novel tandem-redox electrolyte solution containing [Co(dtb)3]2+/[Co(dtb)3]3+ and [Fe(dmb)3]2+/[Fe(dmb)3]3+, and demonstrated an improved electron-collection efficiency.43 In a more recent study, DSSCs with an electrolyte solution including Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles and I−/I3− redox shuttles were developed. In these interesting electrolyte solutions, the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles were responsible for the dye regeneration and the I−/I3− redox system participated in the reaction at the CE. With the cobalt-based redox system alone, the Pt CE obtained a Jsc of 11 mA cm−2, a Voc of 882 mV, a FF of 0.67 and a PCE of 6.5%. On the other hand, when used in conjunction with the tandem-redox electrolyte solution, the Pt CE had enhanced Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCEs of 11.8 mA cm−2, 885 mV, 0.72, and 7.5%, respectively.44 With the synergistic effects of the tandem-redox electrolyte solution, excellent DSSC performance can be obtained. This provides another important way to improve the performance of DSSCs.
5. Conclusions and outlook
In this mini-review, the recent progress and important contributions of CE materials such as carbon materials, TMCs, conductive polymers, and hybrids have been discussed and reviewed for Co-mediated DSSCs. These CEs are more suitable for the regeneration of Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles, which is favorable for achieving high PCE. Due to the high surface area and high electrical conductivity, carbon materials were used in Co-mediated DSSCs, reaching a PCE of 13.0%. For TMCs, Pt-like catalytic behavior and good stability make them great potential alternatives to Pt. Because of the transparency, flexibility and availability of conductive polymers, their use as CEs has made significant progress and a PCE of 10.30% was achieved in Co-mediated DSSCs. Moreover, hybrid CEs exhibited excellent performance because of the synergetic effects that derived from their different components of hybrid materials.
To solve the problem of Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles and overcome the Pt electrode challenge, and thus promote Co-mediated DSSCs commercial application, there are still several key steps needed for the optimization of PCE in the future: (1) the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles present superior performances of dye regeneration, however, the larger size of the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles results in lower ion mobility. Therefore, the novel approach of using a tandem-redox electrolyte solution, especially using other redox shuttles, may improve the performance of DSSCs; (2) the inefficient charge transfer of the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles at the CE also limits the PCE. Therefore, optimizing the structure of Pt-free CE catalysts further improves their performance. Meanwhile, the properties of Pt-free CE catalysts should be matched with the Co2+/Co3+ redox shuttles; (3) the stability of Co-mediated DSSCs limits their applications in practice. Facile deposition techniques with enhanced stabilities will improve the possibility of commercial applications of Co-mediated DSSCs; (4) a detailed mechanistic understanding of Co-mediated DSSCs is vital to developing novel CE catalytic materials and processes that can be used to drive them in affordable and sustainable methods; (5) considering practical application, solid state DSSCs should be given more attention in future.
