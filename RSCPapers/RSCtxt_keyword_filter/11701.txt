    , Accepted 21st October 2020First published on 28th October 2020AbstractWe report a scalable, low-temperature TiOx electron transport layer (ETL) produced directly on top of perovskite in an inverted architecture device by an open-air chemical vapor deposition (OA-CVD) process. The OA-CVD pyrolysis of a titanium ethoxide precursor forms a fully inorganic, conformal, and compact TiOx film. The resultant film is mechanically robust and exhibits a fracture toughness 30-fold higher than commonly used fullerene-based ETL films. The TiOx is an effective barrier layer against environmental degradation—unencapsulated devices with the TiOx ETL retain 60% of their initial efficiency after 1000 hours in ambient aging conditions—compared to devices with a fullerene ETL which were inoperable after 144 hours. Inverted architecture devices with an optimized TiOx ETL thickness of 70 nm exhibited high open-circuit voltages of 1.08 V. We comment on the photocatalytic properties of TiOx and the influence of an amorphous film on maximum power point stability.
Introduction
Since the development of the first perovskite solar cell (PSC),1 significant progress has been made in the design of devices to optimize their optoelectronic performances to reach power conversion efficiencies of 25%, comparable to the performance of silicon solar cells.2 Fullerene-based, organic electron transport layers (ETLs), such as [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), C60, and their derivatives have been used extensively and are by far the most common ETLs deposited on the perovskite for the inverted, P–I–N architecture due to their low-temperature processing.3–7 However, the high cost of organic precursors8 and their typical deposition methods of spin-coating and vacuum thermal evaporation limit large-scale adoption. More importantly, the susceptibility of these materials to environmental degradation leads to PSCs with poor chemical and mechanical stability and limited lifetimes.9,10 Previous work from our lab showed that the measured fracture resistances, Gc – a key metric for thermomechanical reliability – of fullerene-based charge transport layers were so low (Gc < 0.2 J m−2) that they significantly limit the commercialization potential of this architecture as a viable technology.11–13
Inorganic charge transport layers have demonstrated better barrier functionality against environmental species as liquid water-resistant devices that are more stable to humidity.14 Their improved thermal stability allows them to double as buffer layers enabling sputtered transparent conducting oxides15 for tandem applications and compatibility with high-temperature encapsulation methods in industry-standard lamination processes.16 Despite their advantages, inorganic charge transport layers have not been readily adopted as the sole charge transport layer, especially on top of perovskite in inverted P–I–N architectures because processing methods that involve high energy particle bombardment or high temperature annealing or sintering steps also damage the perovskite layer. Previous reports of inorganic ETLs for inverted devices typically incorporate an intermediary fullerene-based layer,14,17–19 while a limited number of studies on fullerene-free inverted devices rely on spin-coating of sol–gels20–22 or vacuum-based depositions23 neither of which are amenable to large scale or in-line production.
A dense TiO2 layer can be prepared by a variety methods such as spin coating, sol–gel,24 aerosol spray pyrolysis,25–27 atomic layer deposition,28,29 magnetron sputtering,30–32 chemical vapor deposition,33 or electrochemical deposition.34 However, these methods involve complicated fabrication procedures or equipment which need vacuum environments that dramatically increase the overall cost of fabrication or are less suitable for large area devices. In addition, solution-based film processing techniques for ETLs beneath the perovskite in N–I–P architecture are not typically transferrable for deposition on top of bare perovskite, which can easily be degraded by chemical solvents or under sintering conditions that are typical for producing compact TiO2 films.
In this work, we use a scalable Open-Air Chemical Vapor Deposition (OA-CVD) process capable of depositing a compact TiOx thin film directly on top of perovskite with inherent barrier properties as an effective n-type ETL for perovskite solar cells. It is an attractive low-energy and low-temperature alternative involving simple equipment that can be adopted for roll-to-roll and sheet-to-sheet processing, compatible with industrial manufacturing. The OA-CVD TiOx deposited films have 30-fold higher fracture energy resistance than common organic ETL films, with more than 7-fold longer operational lifetimes when aged in ambient conditions.
Results and discussion
Open air chemical vapor deposition (OA-CVD)
A 250 nm thick TiOx film was deposited with the OA-CVD experimental setup (Fig. 1a) using a titanium ethoxide precursor in a nitrogen carrier gas with the deposition parameters listed in Table S1.† Deposition parameters were carefully tuned to control the resultant film thickness. Top down scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images revealed densely packed ∼50 nm in dia. grains comprised of ∼5 nm dia. densely packed particles (Fig. 1b). SEM cross-sections (Fig. 1c) revealed that the columnar grain morphology was dense and compact without pinholes. The observed morphology was in contrast with a powder-like morphology that would be observed with powder aggregation initiating in the gas phase. The flash-evaporated titanium ethoxide precursor undergoes a thermal decomposition to cleave the hydrocarbon ligands similar to a process studied using in situ mass spectroscopy with a comparable metal alkoxide of titanium isopropoxide.35 The titanium ethoxide precursor with a lower boiling point (<250 °C at 1 atm) was thus chosen over more common materials such as titanium isopropoxide or titanium butoxide (tetrabutyl titanate) (∼315 °C at 1 atm) because it is a liquid metal alkoxide with the fewest carbon bonds for undesired and extraneous cleavage sites beyond C–O bonds. Despite the high reactivity of metal alkoxide precursors with ambient moisture, the small nozzle-to-substrate distance (1 mm) and hot exiting precursor vapors (≈100 °C) limit nucleation to the substrate surface.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of the OA-CVD deposited TiOx film revealed primarily a 1:1.94 ratio of Ti to O species (Fig. S1†). There was negligible presence of a C1s peak at 290 eV binding energy, suggesting a more complete pyrolysis and vaporization of organic ligands possibly due to fewer methyl groups in titanium ethoxide, in contrast to previously reported results.35 Due to the low-temperature deposition and anneal, the deposited TiOx film was amorphous, as confirmed by Grazing Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXRD) measurements (Fig. S2†).
TiOx film on top of perovskite
The morphology of OA-CVD deposited TiOx films on top of a double cation perovskite layer with composition Cs0.17FA0.83Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 (CsFA) were characterized using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 2). Similar TiOx films deposited on a silicon substrate were fabricated for comparison. The root-mean square surface roughness, Rq, of films were measured over a 1 μm2 area. The 30 nm and 100 nm thick TiOx films deposited on silicon exhibited low RMS roughness < 5 nm. This suggests that the higher RMS roughness of TiOx on perovskite (>10 nm) is a result of the TiOx layer conforming to the inherent rougher morphology of the underlying perovskite with RMS roughness > 15 nm. Indeed, the AFM scan images of TiOx on perovskite have visibly darker and deeper valleys than the scan images of TiOx on silicon.

The bare perovskite is exposed to chemical vapors during OA-CVD film deposition, and it is imperative that formation of the ETL simultaneously preserves the fragile perovskite structure. XRD (2θ–ω) measurements were performed on a glass/perovskite test architecture before and after TiOx film deposition (Fig. 3a), where the main perovskite (001) peak at 2θ = 14° is unchanged. A small peak at 2θ = 12.75° attributed to PbI2 (001) increases slightly in perovskite/TiOx films, but additional (002) and (003) reflections from PbI2 are not observed. The spectra indicate that the OA-CVD process does not significantly damage or alter the perovskite crystal structure. UV-vis spectroscopy measurements before and after TiOx film deposition also confirm that the optical absorption of the perovskite layer remains unchanged (Fig. 3b).

Device performance and optoelectronic properties
The TiOx ETL was integrated into an inverted P–I–N device architecture (ITO/NiOx/CsFA perovskite/TiOx/Al) and cross-sectionally imaged in Fig. 4a. The energy band diagram of the entire device is illustrated in Fig. S3.† During fabrication and testing of the PSCs, we discovered that appropriate selection of the top metal electrode was crucial in achieving high Jsc values. Current–voltage measurements of a glass/ITO/TiOx/electrode test structure showed significantly higher resistance with an Ag top electrode compared to an Al electrode (Fig. S4†). Ti and Au contacts on top of TiOx also yielded similarly low Jsc values. Several reports in literature of metal contacts above a bare TiOx film were also limited to using an Al top electrode, possibly due to its lower work function allowing an ohmic contact with TiOx.14,18,19

Based on the experimental setup of OA-CVD illustrated in Fig. 1a and as mentioned previously, the TiOx thickness is readily tunable. Fig. 4b plots the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of several champion devices with TiOx thicknesses of 30, 70, 100, and 150 nm. The optimal thickness at 70 nm yielded devices that were 13.3% efficient with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.08 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 19.8 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 62.4% on an active area of 0.21 cm2. The lower Jsc and FF but higher Voc of devices (Table S2†) was attributed to the presence of PbI2 at the perovskite/TiOx interface as evidenced by the PbI2 peak in Fig. 3a after TiOx deposition. The PbI2 peak increased in intensity at the thickest TiOx film because the significantly longer processing time subjected the perovskite layer to more thermal degradation (Fig. S5†). Increasing the TiOx thickness resulted in poorer device performance due to decreases in Jsc from more series resistance (Fig. S6†) and decreases in Voc. In contrast, thinner TiOx films led to poor device performance since the rougher perovskite layer (Fig. 2) was not fully planarized and resulted in incomplete coverage of the perovskite surface with visible metal–halide induced degradation after deposition.36
The optoelectronic charge transfer properties of the OA-CVD deposited TiOx film were compared with those of C60/BCP, an organic ETL combination used in inverted P–I–N devices as reported by others.37–40 Glass/perovskite/ETL test structures characterized with steady-state photoluminescence showed quenching at an emission wavelength of 750 nm (Fig. 4c), closely matching the expected band gap of 1.63 eV for the CsFA composition41 used in this study. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements on these structures (Fig. 4d) revealed short TRPL lifetimes for C60/BCP (τ = 13 ns) indicating fast charge quenching and charge transfer. The TRPL lifetimes for TiOx (τ = 36 ns), albeit longer than those of C60/BCP, are within the range reported by others42 and indicate that TiOx ETLs can effectively extract photogenerated electrons resulting in high Voc values.
Device operational stability
Steady-state device performance was characterized with unencapsulated TiOx ETL devices with maximum-power point tracking (MPPT) under full spectrum illumination in ambient conditions (45% RH, 25 °C). The normalized efficiency of the TiOx ETL device decreased to 60% of its initial value after 600 seconds of MPPT (Fig. 5a). Devices were able to recover their initial efficiency in single J–V scans post-MPPT measurement. The transient instability behavior in TiOx ETL devices is likely related to device hysteresis effects (Fig. S7†) during repeated MPPT perturb-and-measure steps. Hysteretic effects are less evident in C60/BCP ETL devices (Fig. S8†) which benefit from the shorter observed TRPL lifetimes (Fig. 4d). In addition to ion migration in the perovskite layer, several authors report that hysteresis may stem from inefficient charge extraction at the perovskite/charge transport layer interface, leading to a capacitive current.43–45 Thermal annealing is a simple method that can improve a transport layer's charge extraction efficiency and electronic properties through crystallization of amorphous domains and passivation of defects leading to reduced non-radiative recombination of charge carriers. An OA-CVD deposited TiOx film annealed in ambient at 450 °C for 30 minutes produced a film with anatase crystal phases (Fig. S2†) and a resistivity almost two orders of magnitude lower than the amorphous film (Table S3†).

(b) Normalized efficiency of devices with TiOx ETL and C60/BCP ETL shelf-aged in uncovered and ambient conditions (25 °C, 45% RH) over 1000 h, taken from eight devices over four substrates for each ETL. 
Since the thermal sensitivity of perovskite restricts a high temperature anneal treatment of the amorphous TiOx film on top of perovskite, two sets of devices were fabricated in a normal N–I–P architecture (FTO/TiOx/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag), where the ETL was either a TiOx film as deposited or post-thermally annealed as TiO2. Devices with the annealed TiO2 ETL demonstrated a stable power output (Fig. 5a), suggesting that a more conductive transport layer with fewer defects may mitigate a decaying power output instability. More work is needed to understand the relationship between transport layer conductivity, defect-mediated non-radiative recombinations, and MPPT. Given that the thermal stability of perovskite does not allow high temperature annealing of inorganic ETLs, other reports of less-common inorganic ETL materials such as CeOx22 and Nb2O523,46 may be promising on top of perovskite due to their higher conductivities in the amorphous phase.
Despite MPPT stability challenges, P–I–N devices (ITO/NiOx/perovskite/ETL/metal) with a TiOx ETL demonstrated impressive barrier properties against environmental species when compared to an organic ETL combination of C60/BCP. Fig. 5b compares the normalized efficiencies of the two ETLs taken at select time points as the devices shelf-aged in uncovered and ambient conditions (45% RH, 25 °C) for 1000 hours. Devices with C60/BCP ETL were completely inoperable after 144 hours of aging. Devices with a TiOx ETL initially experienced a slight increase in efficiency, possibly due to air passivation of defects, and then remained operational past 1000 hours of aging.
TiOx material stability and mechanical integrity
Although TiO2 is a widely used ETL, it is also a known photocatalyst, and several reports have investigated the ultraviolet (UV) stability of TiO2-based PSCs.47–50 TiO2 in the presence of UV light will catalyze the formation of radical species from oxygen or water in air, which can adversely react with and degrade the perovskite film. The UV stability of glass/perovskite/TiOx test structures was characterized by comparing UV-vis absorption spectra before and after aging under 1 sun illumination (through the glass side) for 24 hours in air (45% RH) at 40 °C. Fig. 6a highlights a dramatic change in the absorption spectra of the TiOx test structures compared to the pristine test structure. In contrast, the absorption spectra change in bare perovskite or bare perovskite with other ETL materials was minimal under the same testing conditions (Fig. S9a–c†), suggesting that the TiOx/perovskite interface is the likely cause for accelerated degradation of the perovskite layer. XRD measurements of the aged TiOx test structure revealed the presence of many additional peaks, including those at 2θ = 26.65° and 37.9°, corresponding to the (002) and (003) reflections of PbI2, respectively (Fig. S10†).

(b) Gc ETL comparison of PCBM (spin-coated), C60 (thermal evaporation), and TiOx (OA-CVD) and cohesive fracture path. 
To confirm the role of the photocatalytic effect, TiOx test structures were subsequently aged in conditions either without light or without air species. The similar post absorption spectra in Fig. 6a suggests that the combination of light and air must be present to observe the large spectra change associated with the accelerated photocatalytic degradation. This result indicates that the UV-based degradation can be mitigated through standard device encapsulation procedures. Interestingly, we also observed that test architectures of glass/TiOx/perovskite—representative of more commonly used N–I–P configurations—exhibited minimal change in absorption post-aging in Fig. S9d,† possibly due to different interface chemistry for a perovskite layer deposited over the TiOx film.
In addition to optoelectronic stability, the thermomechanical reliability of a solar cell is equally crucial. The use of a mechanically robust ETL will ensure that the device remains intact through the mechanical stresses from the fabrication processes and thermal cycling during standard operation. The cohesive fracture energy (Gc) of various ETLs were characterized by a Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) method in Fig. 6b. OA-CVD deposited TiOx films with an optimized thickness of 70 nm yielded a Gc value of 6.1 ± 1.15 J m−2, which is comparable to cohesive fracture energies reported for SiO2.51 These values are exceedingly higher (60× & 30×) than those of common fullerene-based ETL counterparts of PCBM and C60, which have low cohesive fracture energies of 0.13 ± 0.05 J m−2 and 0.22 ± 0.07 J m−2, respectively. Indeed, the exceptionally fragile cohesive energies of these organic films altogether rule them out as viable technologies for scalable manufacturing and extended operation, and previous work has already observed delamination in the fullerene layer for fully encapsulated devices.16
Much of the focus in the perovskite field has been on achieving high efficiency devices by tuning the bottom transport and perovskite layers to optimize devices, with organic top layers that are easier to process without damaging the underlying perovskite layer. This work demonstrates a scalable technique for fabricating inorganic transport layers on top of perovskite. Future work should address improving device fill factor by examining how inorganic precursor choices (e.g. SnO2,52–57 CeOx,22 and Nb2O523,46) and processing conditions can improve ETL conductivities and interfacial properties with the perovskite layer.
Conclusion
We have demonstrated PSCs with a fully inorganic ETL deposited on top of perovskite using open-air and scalable methods. The low-temperature OA-CVD method can deposit conformal and dense films with a controlled thickness while preserving the underlying perovskite structure. TiOx ETL films demonstrate photoluminescence quenching, and inverted architecture devices with TiOx exhibit high open-circuit voltages. Additionally, TiOx ETL films are mechanically robust exhibiting improved barriers to moisture and air ingress than competing organic ETLs. Future improvements to device performance and stability will focus on improving the interface between TiOx and perovskite layers.
Experimental methods
Open-air chemical vapor deposition of TiOx
Titanium ethoxide (CAS: 3087-36-3, Sigma-Aldrich) was diluted with 20 vol% toluene (anhydrous, DriSolv), and the precursor was stored in a glovebox when not in use. A flash evaporator provided by Plasmatreat GmbH (Hayward, CA, USA) was mounted on a gantry with a 1/8′′ pipe gas outlet nozzle set 1 mm above the substrate surface. Substrates are placed on a hotplate at 100 °C. The titanium ethoxide precursor is fed at 2 μL min−1 along with 4 SLPM of carrier N2 gas into the evaporator set at 250 °C. The evaporator and gas exit nozzle are rastered over the surface of the substrate in a serpentine fashion with a path speed of 10 cm s−1 and a line spacing of 0.5 mm.
Perovskite precursors
The perovskite precursor solution consisted of 285.5 mg formamidinium iodide (FAI) (Dyseol), 88.3 mg cesium iodide (CsI) (Sigma), 686.9 mg lead iodide (PbI2) (TCI), and 187.2 mg of lead bromide (PbBr2) (TCI). All solvents were anhydrous and used as received (Acros). A 1.0 M solution of Cs0.17FA0.83Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 was made by dissolving the solid amounts above in 1.6 mL of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and 0.4 mL dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (4:1 ratio) in a glovebox. The prepared perovskite solution was stirred at 60 °C for 1 h in inert atmosphere, then filtered with a 0.45 μm Durapore (PVDF) membrane filter. The solution was used within a month of mixing.
Device fabrication
ITO-coated glass (Xin Yan, 10 Ω per □) was cleaned by successively sonicating in Extran detergent diluted 1:10 in DI water, pure DI water, acetone, and isopropanol for 10 minutes each before being treated in a UV-ozone chamber at 25 mW cm−2 for 15 min (Jelight Model 42). Then, 40 μL of NiOx solution (291 mg NiNO3 hexahydrate in 940 μL ethylene glycol and 60 μL ethylene diamine all obtained from Sigma-Aldrich) was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 30 seconds in air, then quickly placed on top a hot plate at 300 °C for 1.5 h.
Perovskite films were spin-coated in a glovebox by first spreading 20 μL of perovskite across the NiOx film. The precursor was spun in a two-step program with the first step at 1000 rpm for 12 seconds and the second step at 6000 rpm for 30 seconds. During the last 5 seconds of the second step, 60 μL of chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich) was quickly dispensed over the film. The substrates were then immediately placed on a hot plate at 100 °C for 30 min in the glovebox.
Devices with inorganic TiOx ETLs were fabricated as described above. For the N–I–P structure, a spiro-OMeTAD solution was made by dissolving 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD (Lumtec) in 1 mL chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich) and then adding 17.5 μL of 520 mg mL−1 LiTFSI dopant (Sigma-Aldrich) in acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich) and 28.8 μL of tert-butylpyridine (Sigma-Aldrich) before filtering through a 0.2 μm PTFE filter. For each device, 40 μL of spiro-OMeTAD solution was spun at 3000 rpm for 30 seconds. For organic ETLs in P–I–N, 40 nm C60 (MER Corporation) at 0.3 Å s−1 followed by 7.5 nm BCP (TCI) at 0.2 Å s−1 was thermally evaporated (Angstrom Amod). Finally, 150 nm of metal electrode (Kurt J. Lesker) was thermally evaporated through a patterned shadow mask (Ag for organic ETL; Al for TiOx ETL).
Device characterization
The perovskite solar cell current–voltage measurements were measured in ambient conditions (45% RH, 25 °C) under 1 sun, AM 1.5 G illumination performed using a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter and 300 W xenon lamp (Oriel) solar simulator. The lamp was calibrated with an NREL-calibrated KG5 filtered Si reference cell. J–V curves were taken over an active area of 0.21 cm2 from forward (1.2 V) to reverse bias (−0.05 V) sampled at 0.01 V intervals with a 0.1 s delay time at each voltage step before taking data. Maximum power point tracking was performed every 2 s using a perturb and measure software with a voltage step of 0.05 V to continuously track power output.
Film characterization
X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) (PHI 5000 Versaprobe, Physical Electronics Inc., US) using an Al-Kα (1486 eV) X-ray source operated at 150 W was employed for characterizing the chemical compositions of the films. The pass energy was fixed at 117.4 eV for survey scans over a range of 0–1000 eV (energy step of 1 eV and a time of 20 ms) for 5 cycles with a spot size of 200 μm2. An argon ion gun pre-sputter was applied to remove any surface atmospheric contaminants.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on an X'PERT PRO diffraction system (PANanalytic) equipped with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Grazing incidence 2θ scans were obtained using a 0.27° parallel plate collimator, a step size of 0.05°, ω = 3.6°, and a dwell time of 1 s for 20°< 2θ < 60° for TiOx films. 2θ–ω scans in Bragg–Brentano geometry were obtained using a 0.27° parallel plate collimator, a step size of 0.05°, and a dwell time of 1 s for 10°< 2θ < 70° for perovskite films. A baseline correction was applied to remove the broad feature associated with the glass substrate.
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images were taken with an FEI Magellan 400 XHR (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Samples were coated with 5 nm of Au/Pd (60:40) ratio before imaging to mitigate charging. UV-vis absorption spectroscopy was obtained using a spectrophotometer (Agilent Cary 6000i). Roughness measurements were obtained with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) (Park NX-10) using a NSC15:Al tip operated in tapping mode. Contact stylus profilometry (Veeco Dektak 150) was used to measure the film thickness with a film edge created by masking off a section of the substrate before film deposition. Steady-state photoluminescence and time-resolved photoluminescence were measured using a Horiba FluoroLog fluorimeter. Test device architectures of glass/perovskite/TiOx were excited with a 635 nm laser (Picoquant P-C-635M and PDL 800-B operating at 2.5 MHz and 8 × 10–5 Watts per cm2 average intensity). A Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) method was used for lifetime measurements.
Mechanical Gc testing
TiOx films were deposited with OA-CVD on an undoped silicon beam, followed by evaporation of 5 nm of titanium and 100 nm of Al as additional bonding layers. The stack was then bonded to another silicon beam with a brittle room-temperature cured epoxy adhesive (E-20NS) and clamped together to cure overnight. Double Cantilever Beam (DCB) specimens were loaded under displacement control in a thin-film cohesion testing system (Delaminator DTS, Menlo Park, CA) from which a load, P, versus displacement, Δ, curve was recorded. Prior to testing, a razor blade is inserted between the silicon beams to initiate a pre-crack. The fracture energy, Gc (J m−2), was measured in terms of the critical value of the applied strain energy release rate, G. Gc can be expressed in terms of the critical load, Pc, at which crack growth occurs, the crack length, a, the plain strain elastic modulus, E′, of the substrates, and the specimen dimensions: width, b, and half-thickness, h. Gc is calculated from58 (1)
An estimate of the crack length was experimentally determined from a measurement of the elastic compliance, dΔ/dP, using the compliance relationship: (2)
All Gc testing was carried out in laboratory air environment (45% RH 25 °C). The specimen was loaded in tension with a displacement rate of 1.0 μm s−1 until reaching Pc and then unloaded slightly to determine the compliance before re-loading. This procedure was continued until crack length equaled L − 4h, where L is the length of the substrate.
