    , Accepted 23rd September 2011First published on 17th October 2011AbstractWe present a one-step solvothermal approach to prepare uniform graphene–TiO2 nanocomposites with delicately controlled TiO2 nanostructures, including ultra-small 2 nm nanoparticles, 12 nm nanoparticles and nanorods. Using three composites as photoanode materials, the effect of nanostructure of graphene-composited TiO2 on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells was investigated, and results showed that the ultra-small 2 nm TiO2–graphene composite based photoanode exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency of 7.25%.

Graphene, an atomic sheet composed of sp2 hybridized carbon, has drawn much attention due to its unique mechanical and electrical properties and high theoretical surface area.1–6Graphene has been extensively investigated as a support material and electron transfer medium in inorganic composites for various applications, such as electrocatalysis,7 supercapacitors,8hydrogen storage,9,10 and photovoltaic devices.11,12

        TiO2 is an important semiconductor with high photoactivity, good stability and relatively low toxicity.13–15 Since the incorporation of TiO2 nanomaterials into photoanode, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has increased remarkably,16,17 thus providing a promising solar harvesting technology. The enhanced performance is due to increased dye adsorption in the nanostructured TiO2 film and suitable electronic structure of TiO2. However, a major challenge for TiO2 DSSCs is the efficient photogenerated electron transport across the TiO2 matrix to reduce or eliminate the charge carriers recombination process.17
To date, numerous synthetic methods to produce graphene–TiO2 composites as photoanode materials have been reported.17–20 The incorporation of graphene can improve the performance of TiO2-based DSSCs through enhancing electron transport while suppressing charge recombination.17,21 It is known that the photoactivity and electronic structure of TiO2 are strongly dependent on its nanostructure.22,23 However, the effect of graphene-composited TiO2 nanostructure on the DSSC performance has not been studied. Solvothermal alcoholysis has been widely used for preparing TiO2 with controllable morphology and high crystallization degree.24 Solvothermal syntheses of 20 nm spherical TiO2–graphene composites and TiO2 nanosheet–graphene composites have been recently reported,5,22 which confirms the potential application of solvothermal alcoholysis in the preparation of graphene–TiO2 composites with delicately controlled TiO2 nanostructures. Herein we report a one-step solvothermal approach to prepare different graphene–TiO2 composites, including 12 nm spherical TiO2–graphene nanosheets (STG), ultra-small 2 nm TiO2–graphene nanosheets (USTG), and TiO2 nanorod–graphene nanosheets (NRTG), by simply adjusting the solvothermal reaction conditions. The prepared composites were used to fabricate DSSC photoanodes and the effect of graphene-composited TiO2 nanostructure on the device properties was investigated.
The solvothermal approach for producing different graphene–TiO2 composites is shown in Scheme 1. Briefly, titanium isopropoxide (TIP) was added dropwise into different organic dispersion of graphene oxide (GO, obtained through a modified Hummers' method) and the mixtures were sonicated for 1 h to render uniform grafting of TIP molecules onto the GO nanosheets.18 The reduction of GO and crystallization of TiO2 were simultaneously achieved through a one-step solvothermal reaction and the reaction conditions were appropriately adjusted to produce the three composites (see ESI† for experimental details).
 Scheme 1  The procedure of the one-step solvothermal approach. 
The nanostructures of the three composite nanosheets were investigated using TEM (Fig. 1). Due to the relatively smooth and planar structure of obtained GO (Fig. S1†), uniform loading of TiO2 nanocrystals on graphene sheets was achieved for all three composites. These homogenous and dense structures increase the contact between graphene and TiO2, thus fully utilizing the good charge transport properties of graphene sheets. From Fig. 1a, the spherical TiO2 nanocrystals of STG can be clearly distinguished with an average particle size of 12 nm. For USTG, the ultra-small TiO2 particles were about 2 nm as determined from high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). The much smaller 2 nm size allows the TiO2 nanoparticles to form a more compact structure (evident in Fig. 1) on the graphene sheets, which lowers the exposure of graphene to dye and electrolyte, and may reduce electron leakage from the graphene sheets back to the dye or electrolyte. HRTEM also reveals the well-defined crystallinity of ultra-small TiO2 with a lattice spacing of 0.35 nm, which corresponds to anatase (101) planes. The TiO2 nanorods in NRTG with lengths up to 20 nm and diameters of 5 nm are observed. The nanorods display some overlap onto each other (Fig. 1b) compared to the more orderly and compact arrangement of the spherical nanoparticles. These observations demonstrate the ability of the current one-step solvothermal approach to control the particle size of composited TiO2 (STGvs.USTG) as well as the morphology (STGvs. NRTG).

The X-ray diffraction patterns of the three composites (Fig. 2a) reveal the formation of the TiO2 anatase phase in the three composites (JCPDS 73-1764) through the one-step solvothermal reaction, which is consistent with the HRTEM result. The reduction of GO in solvothermal reactions is confirmed with Raman spectra, as shown in Fig. 2b. GO exhibits Raman shifts at 1605 and 1358 cm−1, corresponding to the G (E2g mode of sp2carbon atoms) and D bands (symmetry A1g mode), respectively.13,25 Upon reduction of GO with strong reductants, the G and D bands shift to lower values, with G band becoming characteristically asymmetric.25–27 Herein, similar trends were observed for the transformation from GO/TIP to graphene–TiO2 composites, accompanying an increased ID/IG ratio, which indicates a decrease in the average size of sp2 domains through the reductions. Thermal reduction of GO can avoid the use of toxic strong reductants, which makes this solvothermal approach a “greener” strategy compared to some previous synthesis methods.17,18

Graphene–TiO2 photoanodes were prepared using the three composites by the doctor-blade technique and calcined at 450 °C for different times. The obtained electrodes are denoted in the format of sample-calcination time (min), e.g.USTG-60. For comparison, electrodes with pure 12 nm spherical TiO2, ultra-small TiO2 and TiO2 nanorods were also prepared. The morphologies of pure TiO2 and composite electrodes were examined using FESEM (Fig. S2†). In general, the composite films are more porous and rougher than the plain TiO2 films, which is consistent with previous reports.17,19 The porous hierarchical structured electrodes are capable of improving the dye adsorption and thus enhancing the light harvesting efficiency.18,19
Performance optimization of the various electrodes is reflected by photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves shown in Fig. S3†. Calcination causes graphene burn-off, especially for the exposed parts, and thus the concentration of graphene decreases slower in the electrodes prepared with compact USTG nanosheets (refer to EDX results in Table S1†). For all three composites, the electrode with higher concentration of graphene gives lower PCE (η), which may be due to the lower anodic reaction rate of dye on the TiO2 matrix in the presence of excess graphene and higher reduction rate of dye on the exposed parts of graphene sheets.14,18 When the weight ratio of graphene reaches 0.011–0.013, the electrodes of the three composites exhibit optimal performance with η increased by 44.8%, 77.3% and 42.8% for STG, USTG and NRTG respectively, in comparison to their respective control, clearly demonstrating that the incorporated graphene can serve as a support material to enhance the electron transfer rate in the photoanodes. The porosity of composite electrode films is improved by the incorporation of graphene (Fig. S2 and Table S2†), which is beneficial for the dye adsorption as discussed above. The porous structure seems to be crucial for USTG-derived electrodes, since the enhancement for USTG is greater than the other two composites. Pure ultra-small TiO2 film is too compact for dye penetration and results in lower dye adsorption efficiency, while incorporation of graphene can effectively improve the porosity, thus rendering high specific surface area on the ultra-small TiO2 (evident in Table S2†). The optimal graphene concentrations obtained here are higher than those reported in previous works.17,18 We attribute this to the smaller particle sizes of TiO2 compared to previous ones, which allows more orderly and compact structure of the current TiO2 particles on the graphene sheets, therefore increasing the contact area with graphene. Longer calcination affects the performances of all three composites. This may be ascribed to the destruction of the graphene network and the collapse of porous films induced by the prolonged thermal treatment.
Three optimal electrodes prepared using different composites and a conventional P25 electrode as a baseline were used to investigate the effect of nanostructure of graphene-composited TiO2 on DSSCs performance. The J–V curves of the four cells in Fig. 3a show that the overall photocurrent densities of three composite electrodes are higher than that of the P25 electrode. The USTG-60 electrode exhibits the highest short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc 13.5 mA cm−2). For STG-45 and NRTG-45 electrodes, the Jsc are 10.5 mA cm−2 and 8.11 mA cm−2, respectively. An interesting feature that should be noted is that the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of USTG-60 and NRTG-45 electrodes is higher than that of the STG-45 electrode. Since the Voc is mainly determined by the difference between the Fermi level of TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte,28 this increment is possibly attributed to the Fermi level shift arising from the band gap broadening of smaller TiO2 crystals due to strong quantum confinement effects. With the highest Jsc and Voc, the USTG-60 electrode gives the highest η with the value of 7.25%, while η of STG-45, NRTG-45 and P25 electrodes are lower at 4.68%, 4.48% and 2.85%, respectively. Fig. 3b displays the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves as a function of wavelength. The maximum IPCE values for P25, NRTG-45, STG-45, and USTG-60 cells are 30%, 38%, 49%, and 62%, respectively, the trend of which is in good agreement with the Jsc for all electrodes. This indicates that the significant improvement of Jsc is due to enhanced photon-to-current conversion efficiency. Furthermore, to investigate the interfacial reactions of photoexcited electrons in these cells, electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were measured at an applied bias of Voc under the illumination of one sun. Nyquist plots (Fig. 3c) of all four cells illustrate two well-defined semicircles. The first semicircle (10–14 ohm) over the high-frequency region represents the Faraday resistance of the redox reaction of I−/I3− at the electrolyte/Pt interface,29 while the second semicircle in the medium frequency region reflects the electron transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, which is the most important and decisive factor in DSSCs.17,30,31 The second semicircles of cells based on the composite electrodes exhibit smaller diameters compared to that of the cell based on the P25 electrode, demonstrating faster electron transfer kinetics by the incorporation of graphene. The interfacial resistance (R3) and capacitance (C1) represented by the second semicircles were fitted with an equivalent circuit of parallel connection of R3 and C1 (the inset of Fig. 3c) as listed in Table S3†. The USTG-60 cell has the smallest R3 but biggest C1, indicating fast electron transfer and high surface area for reduced charge recombination and increased dye adsorption, respectively.30 Bode plots of the cells (Fig. 3d) further confirm that the second semicircle peak frequency of the USTG-60 cell shifts slightly to lower frequency, which indicates a longer electron lifetime in the photoanode due to fast electron transfer in graphene sheets with compact electron leakage barrier formed by ultra-small TiO2 nanoparticles.17,19,30 The EIS analysis offers physical insight into the role of the graphene component and the effect of composited TiO2 nanostructures in the device performance enhancement.

In brief, a one-step solvothermal approach is developed to synthesize graphene–TiO2 composites for DSSC photoanodes, of which the TiO2 nanostructures can be controlled by simply adjusting the solvothermal reaction conditions. The photoanode based on ultra-small 2 nm TiO2–graphene composite exhibits the highest efficiency, which is contributed by the synergistic effects of the high specific surface area produced from the ultra-small TiO2-formed porous structure and low charge recombination due to fast electron transfer in the incorporated graphene with compact TiO2 particles. The current one-step solvothermal approach can be developed as a universal method to synthesize graphene–TiO2 composites with various optimized TiO2 nanostructures for various applications such as photocatalysis, hydrogen evolution and energy storage.
