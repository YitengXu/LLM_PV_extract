    , Accepted 12th November 2018First published on 12th November 2018AbstractIn this work, we have conducted a systematic study of the crystallization of perovskite thin-films during solution-shearing to elucidate how parameters such as substrate temperature and coating speed influence the morphology of the thin-film. Four distinct phases are identified and a morphological phase map is constructed. The formation of these phases is attributed to a delicate balance between the degree and rate of supersaturation and the flux of solution supply to the meniscus line, which dictates the nucleation and the crystal growth process. An optimal phase window is identified and the photovoltaic device under the chosen conditions exhibits a power conversion efficiency over 15%, which is comparable to that of a reference device prepared by the conventional spin-coating process. Furthermore, a large area perovskite film of 57 cm2 is prepared. Small-area devices from different locations within the large-area film show uniform efficiencies with a deviation coefficient of 4.2%, demonstrating the high uniformity of the thin-film.
1. Introduction
Hybrid halide perovskites have established their position as an emerging photovoltaic material due to their outstanding properties such as low density of defects,1,2 long carrier diffusion lengths,3 and high absorption coefficients across the visible light spectrum.4,5 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has rapidly grown in the past few years, achieving a PCE over 22%.6,7 However, as the competitiveness of solar cells is determined by cost per unit power, large-area scaling of PSCs in a facile and cost-effective manner is of critical importance to transition PSCs from laboratories to commercial products.
Most high-performance PSCs were prepared by spin-coating the perovskite layer.6,7 However, spin-coating has an intrinsic limitation of large-area scalability; as the area of the substrate increases, coating the perovskite layer uniformly becomes exceedingly challenging. Furthermore, the majority of the precursor solution (>90%) is wasted during spin-coating,8 which will inevitably raise the fabrication cost of PSCs. In order to overcome these limitations, a variety of scalable coating methods such as spray coating,9–11 electro-deposition,12 slot-die coating,13 soft-cover deposition,14,15 and doctor-blading16–25 have been developed. Doctor-blading, in particular, is the most widely used coating method for large-area deposition of perovskite thin films due to the following advantages: (1) much less precursor solution is wasted compared to spin-coating (an order of magnitude lower in volume consumed per unit area),22 (2) has relatively fast and facile processing steps, and (3) is easily transferable to a roll-to-roll process.26 Using doctor-blading combined with surfactant engineering, Deng et al. recently achieved a PCE over 20% for a small area device and 15% for a large module (33 cm2) at a relatively high coating speed.22 Yang et al. also presented a module PCE of 15.6% with an aperture area > 10 cm2 by carrier transporting layer optimization.27 Furthermore, utilizing doctor-blading, researchers have investigated additives,22 stability enhancement,17,18 effect of solute composition,18,20,21 effect of precursors,16,23 and film formation.19,25 These results together render doctor-blading a highly promising method for large-area production of PSCs.
In this work, we have utilized a technique known as solution-shearing, a coating technique analogous to doctor-blading, to generate thin films of the perovskite CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) over a large area in a facile and cost-effective manner. Upon mapping the morphologies on a plot of substrate temperature versus blade coating speed, we have observed that the morphologies were divided into four distinct phases. The formation of these phases was attributed to a delicate balance between the rate and state of supersaturation and supply of solution to the meniscus, which dictates the nucleation and the crystal growth process. We have also observed that at a given temperature (150 °C), texturing increases with increasing coating speed, evidenced by X-ray diffraction analysis. At an optimal morphology, a PCE of 15% was achieved, which was comparable to that of spin-coated PSCs. Finally, a perovskite film with an area of 57 cm2 was deposited. Multiple small-area devices from different locations within the film exhibited PCEs with a 4.2% coefficient of deviation, demonstrating the high uniformity of our thin film. We project that our analysis of the crystallization mechanics and thin film morphologies, and the demonstration of large area uniformity will be highly useful for further development and eventual commercialization of PSCs in the near future.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
All of the chemicals and materials were purchased and used as received unless otherwise stated. CH3NH3I (MAI) was purchased from Dyesol. PbI2 (99.9985%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. [6,6]phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was purchased from Nano-C. Nickel oxide (NiOx, 3–6 mm granules, 99.995%) was purchased from iTASCO. The other materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich if not otherwise mentioned.
2.2 Preparation of precursor solutions

Halide perovskite. 
The halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) precursor solution for spin-coating was prepared by mixing MAI with PbI2, in a molar ratio of 1:1, in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). DMSO was added to the solution; the volume ratio of DMSO to DMF was 1:8.9. The final concentration was 1.40 M. The solution for solution-shearing was also mixed in the same molar ratio of MAI and PbI2, 1:1; the DMF to DMSO volume ratio was 7:3 and the final concentration was 1.00 M. The solutions were stirred overnight at room temperature (23 °C).


Carrier transporting layers. 
PCBM was dissolved in dichlorobenzene (18 mg mL−1). BCP was dissolved in pure ethanol (0.5 mg mL−1). The solutions were stirred overnight at room temperature (23 °C).

2.3 Device fabrication
The small size (6.2 cm2) device architecture for both spin-coating and solution-shearing was FTO/NiOx/perovskite/PCBM/BCP/Ag. The large size (57 cm2) device architecture for solution-shearing was FTO/NiOx/perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag. FTO-coated glass substrates were cleaned by sonication in acetone, ethyl alcohol, and distilled water in sequence. The substrates were then placed under ultraviolet–ozone (UVO) treatment for 10 minutes. A NiOx thin film was deposited using an e-beam evaporator (A-tech) at a rate of 0.5 Å s−1, with a final thickness of 70 nm. For the spin-coated perovskite, the precursor solution was spin-coated on top of the NiOx layer at 5000 rpm for 30 s followed by dropwise addition of 150 μL of chlorobenzene (Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous, 99.8%) after 5 s of spin-coating. Spin-coating of perovskite was done inside the glove box under a controlled N2 atmosphere. The solution-sheared perovskite layer was coated at speeds of 1.25 mm s−1 to 2.75 mm s−1, while the blade tilt angle and gap between the blade and the substrate were maintained at 3° and 50 μm, respectively. UVO-treated (3 min) glass was used as the blade. The substrate was preheated to the designated temperature for 1 min to ensure that equilibrium is reached. The injection volume of the solution was 15 μL. The coating should start immediately after ink injection as crystallization begins immediately. Solutions of PCBM and BCP were spin-coated in sequence at 1000 rpm for 40 s and 5000 rpm for 30 s, respectively. For the large scale device, C60 and BCP were thermally evaporated under high vacuum at 500 °C for 10 minutes and 100 °C for 100 seconds, respectively. The final thickness of the thermally evaporated C60 and BCP was 10 nm and 5 nm, respectively. A metal electrode (Ag) with a thickness of 100 nm was deposited using a thermal evaporator.
2.4 Measurement and characterization

J–V characteristics were measured at 25 °C under solar-simulated AM 1.5G illumination using a K3000 Solar Simulator (McScience) calibrated using a silicon reference cell to achieve 100 mW cm−2. The large-area device was cut into four samples each with an area of 2.5 × 2.5 cm2; each sample consisted of 5 cells. The aperture area of all PSC devices was fixed at 0.1 cm2 using a metal shadow mask. XRD results were obtained using an Ultima IV (RIGAKU). EQE measurements were carried out using a QEXL Solar Cell Quantum Efficiency/IPCE/Spectral Response Measurement System (PV Measurements). SEM images were obtained using a XL30 microscope (Philips). Optical transmittance measurements were taken using a UV/VIS/NIR spectrophotometer (SolidSpec-3700). TRPL results were obtained using a FL920 (Edinburgh Instruments).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a is a schematic representation of the solution-shearing process. In solution-shearing, the solution is sandwiched between a shearing blade and a heated substrate. A meniscus naturally forms from the edge of the blade down to the substrate. The meniscus is the only region exposed to air; hence, solvent evaporation occurs predominantly near the meniscus. Since the liquid layer becomes thinner towards the edge of the meniscus (near the meniscus line at the air/liquid/solid interface or the crystallizing end), the solvent will be depleted first in this region. The rate of solvent evaporation is determined by the substrate temperature. As the solvent evaporates, supersaturation occurs, which then induces nucleation and crystal growth. The evaporation of the solvent at the meniscus and the temperature gradient induce flux of the solution towards the meniscus due to the coffee-ring and Marangoni effect,28 respectively, which allows the crystals to continue to grow.29,30 As the shearing blade moves across the substrate, the meniscus line moves with it, which allows the growing thin film to propagate across the substrate. The difference between solution-shearing and doctor-blading is elucidated in the ESI (Fig. S1†).

Fig. 1b is a map of thin film morphologies on the plot of substrate temperature versus coating speed. We have also generated thin-films on glass/FTO/PEDOT:PSS substrates at 110 °C at various speeds, through which we observed similar thin-film morphologies to that of thin-films generated on glass/FTO/NiOx substrates (Fig. S2†). We used a 7:3 volume ratio of N,N-dimethylformamide:dimethyl sulfoxide (DMF:DMSO) as our solvent (the reasoning behind our choice of solvent ratio is explained in Fig. S3†). The morphologies exhibited 4 distinct phases, occupying different regions of the plot. Fig. 1c and d are optical microscopy (OM) images and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the representative thin film morphologies of each phase, respectively. Fig. S4† shows a representative AFM image of a reference spin-coated film. In phase 1, microwires aligned in the shearing direction were formed. In phase 2, microwires were also formed, but the microwires were narrower and randomly oriented. In phase 3, close-packed domains with a nucleation point at the center of each domain were formed. Finally, in phase 4, similar looking domains were formed as in phase 3, but the domains were smaller and more numerous. In addition, for phase 4, a significant proportion of the film was composed of voids (i.e. regions devoid of perovskite films).
The occurrence of different phases can be explained by the rate and degree of supersaturation, which dictate the nucleation and crystal growth rate (higher degree of supersaturation yields higher nucleation and growth rate). The rate and degree of supersaturation are intricately determined by the solvent evaporation rate (controlled by the substrate temperature), the surface to volume ratio of the solution near the meniscus line, and the flux of solution towards the meniscus line. Le Berre et al. previously reasoned that the mass of the evaporating solvent and solute thin-film deposition should match the mass of the solvent and solution flux towards the meniscus line, through which a model predicting the increasing thin-film thickness with decreasing coating speed was developed.8 This implies that at the meniscus line (i.e. crystallizing end of the thin-film), the liquid layer is thicker (lower surface to volume ratio) for slower coating speeds (and vice versa). A lower surface-to-volume ratio would yield a lower supersaturation rate at a given solvent evaporation rate (and vice versa). Also, at higher coating speeds, the meniscus line protrudes out further from the blade, through which we can infer that the supply of solution towards the meniscus line will be limited. This would limit the supply of solute during crystal growth. The vice versa would be true for slow coating speeds.
Phase 1 was attained at relatively low substrate temperatures and low blade speeds. As explained above, this would yield a thicker liquid layer and sufficient supply of solution at the meniscus line. Hence, a low supersaturation rate can be assumed. This scenario is depicted in Fig. 2a. According to a previous study,16,25 when the rate of supersaturation is low, an intermediate solvate is formed prior to the formation of perovskite crystals. Such a process was characterized by the growth of microwires, which is indeed what we have observed in phase 1. Phase 2 was composed of narrower randomly oriented microwires. This can be attributed to a faster supersaturation rate, which increases the nucleation and growth rate. The formation of microwires in phase 2 also implies crystallization via the intermediate solvate state.
 Fig. 2  Schematic cross section of the meniscus during solution-shearing: (a) at a slow coating speed (corresponding to phase 1) and (b) at a fast coating speed (corresponding to phase 3) and high substrate temperature. (c) XRD analysis of the four phases. The asterisk, diamond, and square stand for peaks from PbI2, the intermediate phase, and FTO, respectively. 
When the substrate temperature is further increased, phases 1 and 2 transform into phases 3 and 4 (Fig. 1b). The crystals observed in phases 3 and 4 were not shaped as microwires, but rather as granules, indicating that they were formed directly without passing through intermediate solvate states.25 At higher temperatures, the evaporation rate, and hence the supersaturation rate, increases drastically. This allows the system to bypass the intermediate solvate state. Fig. 2b is a schematic depiction of this scenario (the figure was drawn assuming a faster coating speed compared to that of phase 1). Interestingly, at higher coating speeds, the transition of phase 2 to 3 (or 4) occurs at a lower temperature compared to the transition of phase 2 to 3 at lower coating speeds. For instance, at the coating speed of 1.0 mm s−1, phase 2 transitions into phase 3 at around 110 °C. On the other hand, at the coating speed of 0.05 mm s−1, phase 2 transforms into phase 3 at around 125 °C. This can be attributed to the thicker liquid layer and the efficient supply of solution at the meniscus line for slower coating speeds, which render it more difficult (hence a higher temperature is required) to reach a high enough supersaturation rate to bypass the intermediate solvate formation.
The transition from phase 3 to 4 with increasing coating speed follows the same trend as the transition from phase 1 to 2. Increasing the coating speed increases the supersaturation rate and decreases the supply of solution at the contact line, yielding less packed (i.e. higher proportion of voids in the thin film) and smaller grains. Intriguingly, transition from phase 4 to 3 is seen with increasing temperature, at coating speeds >5 mm s−1. This confirms that we can attain a closely packed thin film even at high coating speeds as long as the substrate temperature is set high enough, which is generally the opposite of what is typically reported.25 We have visually observed that at significantly high temperatures, even at high coating speeds, the meniscus line does not protrude out as much as what would have been observed at low temperatures. This is due to the extremely high evaporation rate that prevents the meniscus line from protruding out. Hence, the liquid layer is thicker and a sufficient amount of solution is supplied to the meniscus line, slowing down the rate of supersaturation.

Fig. 2c presents X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the four phases. Phase 1 presents oriented crystal growth toward the (110) direction which is well consistent with the optical image (Fig. 1c) and AFM image (Fig. 1d). Several peaks which are absent from other phases, for example (032) and (211), likely originated from the out-of-plane non-directional growth of the perovskite. Phase 2 shows reduced intensity of peaks compared to phase 1, which confirms the presence of microwires in Fig. 1c. Consistent with our reasoning behind the formation of microwires in phase 1 and 2, peaks from the intermediate solvate of the MAI–PbI2-solvent31 are observed in both phase 1 and 2. The two XRD curves from phase 2, at medium coating speed (0.5 mm s−1) and high coating speed (5.00 mm s−1), are qualitatively very similar except that peaks from (110) and (220) are weaker at the high coating speed. The reduced peak intensities can be attributed to a lower thickness of the film prepared at the higher coating speed. In phases 3 and 4, peaks from a single crystallographic family only, {100}, are observed, which signifies that these films are well-oriented (i.e. higher degree of texturing). Further analysis of the XRD data such as the formation of PbI2 in the slower coating of phase 2 is discussed in the ESI† (additional analysis of Fig. 2c). The effects of coating speed and temperature as independent variables are further shown in Fig. S5–S8.†
As previously mentioned, phases 1 and 2 (microwires) contained voids in the film and were previously determined to have low power conversion efficiency.25,32 Phase 4 also had a significant proportion of voids in the film. The voids can potentially generate shunt paths, degrading the solar cell performance. Hence phases 1, 2, and 4 were deemed inappropriate for solar cells. On the other hand, due to their relatively large-sized and close-packed domains, phase 3 was appropriate for solar cells. Since higher coating speeds lead to lower production costs, we further analyzed the thin films made at relatively high coating speeds from 1.75 to 5.75 mm s−1 at 150 °C for potential use in solar cells. Fig. 3a presents a series of cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of thin films generated at various speeds from 1.25 to 3.75 mm s−1, which shows that the thickness generally decreases with increasing coating speed (also see Fig. S9†). The decreasing trend in thickness is consistent with the results of Deng et al.22 The absorbance spectra in Fig. 4b confirm that at lower coating speeds, the absorbance is higher, which is in agreement with the trend in thickness.

The two main peaks represent the (200) and (400) planes. (b) UV-vis spectroscopy data of solution-sheared (speed from 1.75 mm s−1 to 5.75 mm s−1 at 150 °C) and spin-coated films on glass substrates. (c) Time-resolved-photoluminescence (TRPL) data of the spin-coated and solution-sheared (150 °C, 2.75 mm s−1) samples. 

Fig. 3b and 4a are top view SEM images and XRD peaks obtained at various coating speeds. Looking at the XRD analysis, the intensities of the main peaks, the (200) and (400) reflections, increase with coating speeds from 1.75 mm s−1 to 3.75 mm s−1 even though the thickness is continuously decreasing. This can be attributed to less texturing of the thin-film at lower coating speeds. At a coating speed of 1.25 mm s−1, we observed regions of rough surface morphologies, as seen in Fig. 3b, which can be associated with less textured domains. The XRD peak begins to decrease as the coating speed increases above 3.75 mm s−1. This can be attributed to their thinner film thickness. Also, rapid nucleation and crystal growth can yield growth of grains oriented other than (200); an increase of the (110) reflection is evident. At coating speeds of 4.75 mm s−1 and 5.75 mm s−1, we have observed an increase in the proportion of regions where the boundaries between large domains are composed of smaller domains, which are likely to be less textured. From this analysis, we conclude that there exists a delicate balance between the supersaturation rate and the solution supply to the meniscus line that dictates the nucleation rate and growth process. Further analysis is required to verify the proposed mechanisms, which is currently an on-going research study. Comparing the spin-coated reference film and the solution-sheared films, it is evident that improved crystallinity is realized with the shearing technique.

Fig. 4c shows the time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of solution-sheared and spin-coated films. The weighted average lifetime of the solution-sheared film (397 ns) is much longer than that of the spin-coated film (156 ns), which implies suppressed recombination and is therefore beneficial for photovoltaic device operation. Curve fitting is based on the following equation: A + B1exp(−t/τ1) + B2exp(−t/τ2).33 The weighted average lifetime is calculated as follows: τ1B1/(B1 + B2) + τ2B2/(B1 + B2).
Shearing temperature of 150 °C and coating speeds near 3 mm s−1 (phase 3) are identified as optimal window for device fabrication as they yield a smooth morphology without pinholes, compact domains, and good crystallinity. With those conditions, photovoltaic devices based on solution-sheared perovskite films were fabricated. As shown in Fig. 5a, the device structure consists of an e-beam deposited NiOx hole transporting layer and a PCBM (phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester)/BCP (bathocuproine) electron transporting layer.34 First, the dependence of device performance on coating speed was investigated as shown in Fig. S10,† which revealed the best performance at the coating speed of 2.75 mm s−1. Therefore, further analysis of devices is conducted at a coating speed of 2.75 mm s−1.

(b) J–V curves of spin-coated perovskite reference and solution-sheared perovskite solar cells. The aperture area is 0.1 cm2. (c) External quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of spin-coated reference and solution-sheared perovskite films. 
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of a champion solution-sheared cell and a reference spin-coated cell are presented in Fig. 5b and c, respectively. For statistical analysis, photovoltaic parameters from ten solution-sheared device cells are listed in Table S1.† A tight distribution suggests a high degree of reproducibility of our solution-shearing process. Based on the improved crystallinity (Fig. 4a) and suppressed recombination (Fig. 4c), we anticipated that devices fabricated with a solution-sheared perovskite absorber would outperform those with a spin-coated perovskite layer. However, the solution-sheared perovskite solar cell's efficiency was on a par with that of the spin-coated reference, as shown in Fig. 5b, suggesting that the improved materials quality of the solution-sheared films is not fully utilized. We attribute this to high surface roughness of the solution-sheared films. Root-mean-square (rms) surface roughness of the spin-coated film is ∼20 nm while that of the solution-sheared film ranges from 24 nm to 64 nm (Fig. S4†). The typical thickness of the electron transporting layer, PCBM, which is deposited on the perovskite is 50 nm or less. This thickness is comparable to the roughness of the solution-sheared film. Therefore, a conformal and uniform coating of PCBM over the perovskite surface may be challenging; local shunt paths where PCBM is very thin or even non-existent between the perovskite and metal contact may develop. Addition of a surfactant during the solution-shearing process may offer a solution.22

Fig. 6a presents a large-area (57 cm2) perovskite film prepared on an e-beam NiOx-coated FTO substrate. We used vacuum deposition processes for the hole (NiOx) and electron (C60 and BCP) transporting layers to replace all the processing steps with large-area compatible processes (i.e. to avoid the use of spin-coating). The SEM images taken at four different areas that are far apart from each other are very similar, confirming the long-range uniformity of the film (Fig. 6c). As was the case with the small-area shearing process, the typical morphology of phase 3 can also be found in this film, which indicates that morphology mapping is still valid with scaled-up deposition. The uniformity of the film was further confirmed by fabricating small area devices at various regions within the film. Four samples (marked as 1, 2, 3, 4 in Fig. 6a) each with an area of 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 were cut from the large-area film; each sample consisted of 5 cells. We used these small area devices for our analysis since the sheet resistance of the FTO layer (∼7 ohm per sq) would require the incorporation of a metal grid between the perovskite and the FTO for large area devices.35 Otherwise, the fill factor of the device would be seriously degraded.11 Overall PCEs are lower than those of spin-coated devices with a PCBM electron transporting layer because vacuum-deposited C60 was used; PCBM is known to be better for charge extraction than C60.36 Nonetheless, as shown in Fig. 6b and Table S2,† a very narrow distribution of PCEs across all the devices is evident, which illustrates the formation of uniform large-area perovskite devices over 50 cm2 with great potential for high efficiencies with our solution-shearing technique.

4. Conclusions
Solution-shearing is an attractive technique that is capable of producing uniform large-area films. Film formation during solution-shearing is a result of the complex interplay between many processing parameters. A morphology phase map was constructed in the parameter space consisting of substrate temperature and blade-coating speed, which are among the most influential processing parameters. The occurrence of different morphological phases was explained by the rate and degree of supersaturation and the supply of solution to the meniscus, both of which dictate the rate of nucleation and crystal growth. A phase with compact domains, which is most relevant for photovoltaic application, was identified. The resultant perovskite films were shown to possess high crystallinity and improved charge carrier recombination characteristics than those prepared by the conventional spin-coating process. The formation of a large-area (57 cm2) perovskite film was demonstrated. PSCs were realized using charge transporting layers prepared by a large-area scalable vacuum technique. The PSCs exhibited excellent uniformity in device performance, representing a step towards the realization of high efficiency and large area perovskite devices.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic diagram of the solution-shearing system. (b) Map of different surface morphological phases on the temperature versus coating speed plot. Coating speed is in log-scale. (c) Representative optical microscopy images of the four phases. Scale bar is 200 μm. (d) Representative AFM images of the four phases. Scale bar is 10 μm.	 

 	Fig. 2  Schematic cross section of the meniscus during solution-shearing: (a) at a slow coating speed (corresponding to phase 1) and (b) at a fast coating speed (corresponding to phase 3) and high substrate temperature. (c) XRD analysis of the four phases. The asterisk, diamond, and square stand for peaks from PbI2, the intermediate phase, and FTO, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Cross sectional and (b) top view SEM images of a solution-sheared MAPbI3 film coated at different coating speeds. The substrate temperature is fixed at 150 °C. (c) Magnified top view image of the selected area from (b). Scale bar is 1 μm for (a) and (c) and 5 μm for (b).	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) XRD analysis of a solution-sheared MAPbI3 film with different coating speeds, from 1.75 mm s−1 to 5.75 mm s−1 at 150 °C. Data from the spin-coated reference are also included. The two main peaks represent the (200) and (400) planes. (b) UV-vis spectroscopy data of solution-sheared (speed from 1.75 mm s−1 to 5.75 mm s−1 at 150 °C) and spin-coated films on glass substrates. (c) Time-resolved-photoluminescence (TRPL) data of the spin-coated and solution-sheared (150 °C, 2.75 mm s−1) samples.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Schematic of a perovskite solar cell device with e-beam evaporated nickel oxide, spin-coated PCBM/BCP, and a thermally-evaporated silver electrode.
