    , Accepted 24th February 2019First published on 27th February 2019AbstractMetal halide nanocrystals (NCs) have attracted intensive interest due to their unique optical properties and cheap synthesis which endows them with tremendous potential for application in the field of optoelectronic devices. However, lead toxicity obstructs their commercialization. Therefore, environment- and consumer-friendly all-inorganic lead-free perovskite NCs are highly desirable in terms of application, and recent efforts have investigated lead-free halide perovskite NCs. Herein, in this present work, all-inorganic Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs were synthesized for the first time with a weak-polar solvent at room temperature (WPRT). As-synthesized Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs demonstrated blue dual-emission peaks at 414 nm and 433 nm with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 50 nm and a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) up to 29.6%. Notably, the NCs exhibited high stability upon air exposure exceeding three weeks since the trap states could be passivated under humid conditions. Furthermore, it was also found that potassium oleate (K-OA) solution could enhance the PLQY of Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs.
Introduction
Recently, metal halide perovskites have become an important class of semiconductor materials applied in a variety of optoelectronic devices since they have some exceptional properties, including high defect tolerance, long carrier lifetime, long diffusion length, high absorption coefficients, low trap state density, high exciton binding energy, high carrier mobility, and low-cost solution processability.1–6 These kinds of materials have a general chemical formula of ABX3, in which A and B are cations and X is an anion. Among all these perovskite materials, lead-halide perovskite (LHP) materials have attracted great attention because of their excellent optical and electronical properties for application in photovoltaic devices.7–9 As a light-absorbing layer in solar cells, LHP materials have helped the solar cell achieve an excellent certified power conversion efficiency of over 23% in only a few years,10 which has stimulated the research upsurge of applying these materials in the field of luminescence. Reducing the 3D bulk perovskites to low-dimensional nanoscale counterparts may combine the advantages of nanostructures and the unique optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials.11 In fact, it has been found that LHP nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit a better performance in terms of luminance due to strong electron–hole Coulomb interaction, i.e. high exciton binding energy and fast radiative decay rate, demonstrated by extremely narrow absorption and emission features and short fluorescence lifetimes, which originate from the quantum confinement effect with decreasing size.12,13 Kovalenko et al. first synthesized CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, and I) perovskite NCs in an organic solvent (1-octadecene) through a hot-injection approach.14 Zhong et al. synthesized MAPbX3 (MA = CH3NH3) perovskite NCs using the ligand-assisted re-precipitation method (LARP).11 To the best of our knowledge, the best LHP NCs now can reach a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of about 90%, relatively narrow emission spectra with full width at half-maximum (FWHM) on the order of 12–25 nm, and a wide color gamut of about 150%,15 which is comparable with traditional chalcogenide-based quantum dots (QDs).16–18 As a result, lead-halogen perovskite NCs have become very promising for future luminance and display devices. However, the toxic nature of lead ions at the B-site of the ABX3 crystal structure is self-evident, which has consequently hindered the application of LHP NCs.19,20 In the European Union and many other countries, the use of hazardous heavy metals, including lead, in electronic devices is regulated. Although some end-life-cycle methods can be adopted to control the influence of lead toxicity, this will certainly increase the production cost of LHP devices.21 Therefore, the development of lead-free halide perovskite NCs that retain the excellent features of the original lead halide perovskite NCs is of great academic and industrial interest in optoelectronic technologies. Several reviews and perspectives on lead-free perovskite thin films and NCs have been published.22–26 Furthermore, the application of perovskite NCs is still limited by their instability in air.27 Thus, searching for low toxic and highly stable perovskite NCs can be considered as cutting-edge research.
Tin (Sn) element was the first try to supersede lead in perovskite materials as they are adjacent in the same group. But unfortunately, CsSnX3 NCs only show a very low PLQY of 0.14% because Sn2+ is prone to be oxidized into Sn4+ in air.28 Bismuth is not toxic to humans and it is added to medicines to cure stomach illnesses.29 What is more, bismuth-based compounds have presented excellent stability, while lead-based perovskite materials are very sensitive to moisture in air, which causes performance degradation.27,30 Lian et al. and Li et al. synthesized two-dimensional Cs3Bi2Br9 and MA3Bi2Br9 perovskite nanoplatelets via the hot injection method.31,32 They believed that the geometrical changes of inorganic components determine the relationships between structure and band gap. So, bismuth is an ideal material to substitute lead in perovskite materials. Compared to MA-based perovskite NCs, Cs-based perovskite NCs are usually less sensitive to moisture, heat, and oxygen, and hence display better stability.33 Pal et al. reported the synthesis of Cs3Bi2I9 perovskite NCs, exhibiting unique dual features in both optical absorption and emission.34 These good properties can provide great convenience in fabrication, storage and device operation. Therefore, Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs are more attractive than MA3Bi2Br9 NCs. In general, there are two typical methods to synthesize all-inorganic perovskite: (i) the hot-injection method and (ii) the ligand-assisted re-precipitation (LARP) method. Temperature is the key factor in the hot-injection process, which can modulate the size of perovskite NCs, but temperature is beyond control when the cold precursor solution is added into the high-temperature reaction solvent, resulting in low reproducibility.35 In addition, rigorous synthesis conditions and equipment are required in a higher temperature environment. Hence, these two shortcomings impede the application of the hot-injection method in large-scale fabrication. On the other hand, LARP, which was used to synthesize brightly luminescent MAPbX3 perovskite NCs by Zhong11 has widely been used in the synthesis of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite NCs and all-inorganic perovskite NCs because of its facile process and low cost.36–40 This synthesis approach mainly consists of two steps: (i) dissolving the metal halide source or alkylammonium halide in a “good” solvent, e.g. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which is highly polar; and then (ii) injecting the above-mentioned solution into a “poor” (nonpolar) solvent, such as toluene or octane, containing surface ligands (usually oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OLA)). However, the resulting perovskites are mixtures of NCs and microcrystals, which leads to low production yields.41 Furthermore, polar solvents could degrade and even dissolve perovskite NCs, which could finally decrease the PLQY of perovskite NCs.42 To solve these problems, weak-polar solvents have been used to fabricate highly luminescent and gram-scale CsPbX3 perovskite NCs.43
Halide perovskite NCs exhibit additional characteristics beyond those achievable by classical NCs that are critical for practical applications. The ionic bonding nature of fully inorganic halide perovskite materials enables easy low-temperature preparation of NCs thereof. The simple co-precipitation of ionic precursors at room temperature yields NCs with excellent luminescent properties. Yang et al.44 synthesized all-inorganic Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs with an emission peak at 468 nm and a low PLQY of 4.5% by a modified LARP method. Leng et al.45 promoted PLQY up to 19.4% of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs with a blue emission at 410 nm using ethanol as the antisolvent. Herein, on this basis, we present a facile synthetic approach for bright blue emitting all-inorganic Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs employing weak-polar solvents at room temperature (WPRT). These Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs showed a dual-emission peak at 414 nm and 433 nm with an FWHM of 50 nm, a PLQY of about 29.6% and a Stokes shift of 36 nm. Furthermore, Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs demonstrated excellent stability in air for a period of 21 days, facilitating further investigation and application. The photoluminescence can be further enhanced by adding a certain amount of potassium oleate (K-OA) into the Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs solution. Overall, the nontoxicity, high PLQY, and good air stability of Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs make them promising substitutes for Pb-based perovskite NCs for future applications in various optoelectronic devices.

All reagents were used as received without further purification.
Preparation of Cs–Bi–OA precursor solution
1.5 mmol of Cs2CO3, 0.5 mmol of Bi2O3 and 10 mL of OA were loaded into a 100 mL three-necked flask, and dried for 1 h at 120 °C. Then, the mixture was heated to 180 °C under an N2 atmosphere with magnetic stirring. Until all the Cs2CO3 and Bi2O3 completely reacted with OA, a transparent bronzing solution could be observed. Hereafter, the air in the flask was exhausted at 120 °C for 30 min under N2 atmosphere, followed by natural cooling to room temperature. This Cs–Bi–OA solution was sealed and stored in N2 atmosphere for further use.
Preparation of TBABr–OA solution
TBABr (1 mmol) and dried OA (10 mL) were loaded into a 25 mL of glass vial and the mixture was treated in an ultrasonic container at 50 °C. After completely dissolving of TBABr salt, TBABr–OA solution was sealed and stored in N2 atmosphere for further use.
Preparation of K-OA solution
0.5 mmol of K-OA, 8 mL of ODE and 2 mL of OA were added into a 20 mL glass bottle. Then, the mixture was heated to 150 °C under vigorous stirring for 30 min until a transparent colorless solution could be observed. The solution was sealed and stored in N2 atmosphere for further use.
Synthesis of Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs via WPRT
In a typical synthesis, 1 mL of ODE, 0.1 mL of OA and 0.1 mL of OLA were added into a 20 mL centrifuge tube with vigorous stirring. Then, 200 μL of the TBABr–OA precursor, 40 μL of HBr and 100 μL of Cs–Bi–OA precursor were injected into the tube in sequence. A white cloudy solution could be obtained. After being centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 3 min, the supernatant was taken out and mixed with acetone (volume ratio = 1:1), and a large amount of white precipitate appeared. Next, toluene was added to re-disperse the precipitate and the cloudy solution was centrifuged again to collect the supernatant containing Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs, which was reserved for further characterization.
Synthesis of Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs by LARP
0.3 mmol of CsBr, 0.1 mmol of BiBr3 and 2 mL of DMSO were added into a 5 mL centrifuge tube. Then, the mixture was sonicated at 50 °C for 5 min. A transparent yellow-green solution could be observed. Next, 20 μL of OLAm was added to the solution, and white floccules appeared, but they disappeared quickly after shaking the tube. Following this, 1 mL of the above precursor solution was injected into a 20 mL centrifuge tube containing 5 mL of toluene and 0.5 mL of OA under vigorous stirring, and a white cloudy solution could then be observed. After being centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 3 min, the white precipitate was discarded and the transparent yellowish supernatant was reserved for further characterization.
It should be noted that the synthesis of all the above precursor solutions and Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs can be scaled up.
Characterization of Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were collected using FEI Tecnai G2 20 TEM with a LaB6 filament operating at 200 kV. The samples were prepared by placing several drops of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs diluted in toluene at an optical density of <0.1 onto an ultrathin amorphous carbon-coated copper TEM grid, wicking away any excess solvent. Field emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM) was performed on a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 FTEM operating at 300 kV. To determine the average diameter of the NC samples, 200–300 of the imaged NCs were measured along the C3 axis.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using an X’Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer from PANalytical B.V. equipped with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54178 Å) radiation. Samples were prepared by drop-casting concentrated solutions onto quartz substrates. Data were collected in reflection mode at 2θ values from 5° to 60° in 7 min.
The absorption spectra were obtained using an ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-vis-NIR) spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-3600 plus). The photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra were recorded using an FP-6500 fluorescent spectrometer. Clean NCs were suspended in toluene and diluted to an optical density of 0.6–0.8 at the lowest energy peak. The raw absorption spectra without corrections were plotted unless otherwise stated. The volume of the aliquot was small enough that there was a negligible change in the reaction solution volume over the entire titration.
The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer obtained from Beijing Zolix Co. Ltd. The Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs–toluene solution was excited with a laser of 350 nm and the PLQY was calculated using the following formula:  where Sem1 is the PL integral area of the Cs3Bi2Br9–toluene solution in a cuvette, Sex1 is the penetrated excitation light source intensity integral area of Cs3Bi2Br9–toluene solution in a cuvette, Sem2 is the PL integral area of the toluene solution in a cuvette, and Sex2 is the penetrated excitation light source intensity integral area of the toluene solution in a cuvette. Subscript 1 represents the measurement values of Cs3Bi2Br9–toluene solution in a cuvette, while subscript 2 represents the measurement values of toluene in a cuvette.
All the characterizations were performed at room temperature in air.
Results and discussion
The Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs were synthesized via a WPRT approach. The Cs–Bi precursor was prepared by reacting Cs2CO3 and Bi2O3 with OA. The OLA and OA served as ligands in the NC synthesis process, and the synergistic action of OA and OLA controlled the crystallization kinetics of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs. Specifically, OLA could form a chelate with metal ions Bi3+, whereas OA was able to electronically passivate the surface dangling bond and stabilize the resulting NCs dispersion.46,47 TEM was employed to investigate the morphology and size distribution of the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs. The TEM image shows that the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs had a uniform size distribution and consisted of quasi-spherical nanoparticles with an average size of 10.44 ± 1.29 nm, as shown in Fig. 1a and b.

The FTEM images and XRD patterns were used to study the phase structure of the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs, as shown in Fig. 1c and d. The FTEM image in Fig. 1c reveals high crystallinity with an interplanar distance of 0.328 nm and 0.342 nm, corresponding to the (003) and (200) crystal facets respectively. The XRD pattern showed that the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs exhibited a trigonal crystalline structure with P3m1 symmetry as shown in Fig. 1d and lattice parameters of a = b = 8.216 Å, c = 10.070 Å, and α = β = 90° and γ = 120°. The XRD peaks match well with the standard data, indicating the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs have a high crystallinity, which is consistent with the FTEM result in Fig. 1c. It is worth noting that the unit cell of Cs3Bi2Br9 is different from the general LHP, which can be viewed as triple the LHP unit cell with only two-thirds of the octahedra occupied (Fig. 1e).
HBr is the key factor for generating blue emitting Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs. If HBr was not added to the reaction solution, Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs cannot be obtained. Fig. 2 depicts the schematic overview of the reagents and illustration of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs capped with amine species and carboxylic acid moieties, which are prepared by adding drops of the Cs–Bi–oleate precursor solution in OA solution containing TBABr, ODE, OLA and a small amount of HBr. As capping agents, OA enables colloidal dispersion of the NCs in the nonpolar solvent, while OLA needs to be protonated either by direct reaction with organic acid in high temperature or by the addition of polar solvents even at ambient temperature.40 The acidity of HBr is significantly stronger than that of oleic acid; it can thus easily protonate oleic amine, which forms oleylammonium bromide. In the process of protonation, acetic acid, hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid were used as protonated reagents, respectively. The results showed that acetic acid is too weak and other strong acids like HCl can pollute the reactants. Thus, HBr is the best option to protonize OLA, which not only has strong acidity, but also provides Br.

Through the protonated reaction of HBr, the preferential binding of ammonium species can compete with cesium ions (Cs+) on the surface of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs, affecting the growth kinetics and shape of the resulting Cs3Bi2Br9 building blocks.34,48,49 OLA could restrain the crystallization in the reaction process, while HBr could enable amine protonation, which plays a crucial part in the formation of blue emitting Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs, which has been proved in the synthesis process of CsPbBr3 NCs.41

Fig. 3a illustrates the steady-state absorption and PL spectra of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs in toluene via WPRT. The absorption spectra showed a sharp absorption peak at 378 nm. The PL spectra showed two emission peaks at 414 nm (∼3.00 eV) and 433 nm (∼2.86 eV) with an FWHM of 50 nm (∼0.32 eV), which might stem from different exciton recombination pathways, involving direct and indirect bandgap transitions simultaneously.50 In fact, GaP, WS2, and WSe2, all of which have a direct–indirect bandgap nature, presented PL profiles with a double-peak feature.51–53 Cs3Bi2Br9 showed a wider FWHM than lead halide perovskite, e.g. CsPbBr3, Compared to CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs, the size distribution of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs are nonuniform due to the difficulty of crystallization of Cs3Bi2Br9. Above all, the crystal structures of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs are different from that of CsPbBr3 NCs. As a result, they have entirely different intrinsic luminescence traits. The inset in Fig. 3a shows photographs of the colloidal Cs3Bi2Br9 NC solution under sunlight and 365 nm UV light excitation, in which a brightly blue emission could be observed. The uniform emission of the clear NC solution demonstrates efficient emission without any aggregation at the bottom. Furthermore, a relative Stokes shift of 36 nm was found through comparison of the absorption and PL spectra, which implies almost no overlap between the absorption and emission spectra. The weak self-absorption effect endowed Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs with an obvious advantage in applications in lighting device as phosphors.54 It is worth noting that the PL emission peaks at 414 nm of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs originate from the direct recombination, while the PL emission peaks at 433 nm of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs is from the indirect recombination.50 Phonons participate in the indirect recombination process and the direct recombination can reflect the essence of the materials. We thus chose 414 nm as the characteristic parameter for comparison. In fact, the PL peak of the Cs3Bi2Br9 bulk material is also from direct band gap recombination. Relative to the bulk materials, the PL peak of the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs is blue-shifted by 59 nm (∼0.38 eV), confirming an intense quantum confinement effect. In order to facilitate comparison, the PL spectra of pure solvent and ligands (see the ESI,† Fig. S1 for further details) were also measured. There are no PL peaks for the pure solvent and ligands. In fact, after the synthesis, Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs were washed out with acetone and redispersed into toluene, so there were almost no redundant ligands in toluene.

Inset: Photographs of colloidal Cs3Bi2Br9 NC solution under sunlight (left) and 365 nm UV light excitation (right), (b) UV-vis absorption spectra of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs by WPRT with different volume ratios of TBABr to Cs–Bi–OA, (c) UV-vis absorption spectra of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs by LARP with various molar ratios of CsBr to BiBr3, and (d) PL spectra of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs by LARP and WPRT, respectively. 

Fig. 3b shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs by WPRT with different precursor volume ratios of TBABr to Cs–Bi–OA, from which it could be observed that optimal bright blue emitting Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs could be obtained with a precursor volume ratio of 2:1, an ODE/OA/OLA volume ratio of 10:1:1, drops of HBr and room temperature as the reaction temperature.
A long tail at the low energy side was observed in all the absorption and PL spectra of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs in Fig. 3. These optical characteristics indicated that an indirect transition might participate in optical transitions.55
In order to evaluate the different methods, Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs were also synthesized by LARP based on the fundamental theory that when a precursor solution and another solvent of different polarity are mixed together, the polarity of the whole solution is changed, and the solubility of the original ions in the mixed solution decreases. NCs then appear due to supersaturation.11 All the different combinations were studied to explore the solubility, as listed in Table 1. Eventually, it was found that all Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs synthesized by this method showed a relatively low PLQY. The NCs prepared by adopting DMSO as the “good” solvent, toluene as the “poor” solvent, and OLAm and OA as the assisted ligands showed optimal performance, whose PLQY was just 4.3%. Additionally, the production yields were very low and there were many large-sized perovskite particles due to the dissolution and destruction effects of the polar solvents on the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs.55

Some interesting phenomena could be found through comparing the absorption and PL spectra of the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs fabricated by these two methods. Firstly, the absorption spectra of these Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs obtained by the two kinds of methods had a similar character that the absorption peak position can be finely adjusted by changing the precursor ratio, as shown in Fig. 3b and c. Secondly, the shapes of their emission spectra were very different. For Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs synthesized by LARP, it has only one emission peak at 428 nm (∼2.90 eV), while for those NCs synthesized by WPRT, there were two emission peaks at 414 nm and 433 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3d. For the first phenomenon of the absorption peak position changing, it was attributed to the reason that changing the ratio of precursors would result in the modulation of the energy gap of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs, consequently shifting the absorption peak.54 The difference between the emission spectra was simply due to the fact that the exciton recombination process of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs by WPRT involved both indirect and direct transitions simultaneously, and the emission at 414 nm was produced in direct transition, while the emission at 433 nm was rooted in indirect transition, which has been proved by Zhang's work.56 In fact, different solvent polarity environments and different kinds of precursors and reagents can influence the crystallization and nucleation process of perovskite NCs, and, hence, influence the structure and energy band of crystals. In our experiment, the weak polar solvent environment was observed to induce Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs to generate an indirect band gap additionally. As a result, Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs synthesized by WPRT have different PL features from those synthesized via LARP. It is worth mentioning that Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs by WPRT not only have a higher PLQY than those prepared by LARP, but also can be easily purified using acetone, which will facilitate characterization and device fabrication. Nevertheless, no suitable reagents were found to purify Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs by LARP. Consequently, WPRT demonstrated tremendous superiority to LARP in the synthesis of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs.
The stability of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs is an important figure of merit in terms of practical applications. To investigate the stability of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs, the temporal evolutions of the PL spectra and PLQY of the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs dispersed in toluene were recorded after storing under ambient moisture conditions (relative humidity of ∼40–70%) for three weeks. As shown in Fig. 4a, the PL spectra of the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs showed almost no shift and the FWHM remained almost identical to the previous data after a 21 day storage, implying high photostability of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs. Fig. 4b shows the PLQY variation of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs within 21 days of storage in an ambient atmosphere. Interestingly, the PLQY of the as-synthesized Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs was about 11.2%, and then surged to 22.4% after storing for about 6 h. It reached a maximum of 29.6% after 7 days, and then gradually descended slowly to 23.8% (about 80% of the maximum value) after another fortnight, which was still higher than its initial data. Thus, Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs showed an excellent PL stability, and such a change trend of PLQY could be attributed to the hydrolytic product BiOBr of Cs3Bi2Br9 in ambient moisture environment, which passivated the surface defects of the Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs.37,57 Furthermore, when 300 μL ethanol was added into 5 mL of the Cs3Bi2Br9 NC toluene solution, no obvious decrease of the PL intensity was observed, as shown in Fig. 4c, Traditionally speaking, the polar solvent ethanol can lead to fluorescence quenching of NCs. In our experiments, the PL intensity showed no obvious decrease, exhibiting its superior stability toward ethanol. The only increase of the PL intensity is at 414 nm; it might be because the ethanol could affect the direct combination process of the as-obtained Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs, but not affect the indirect combination of the as-obtained Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs. The in-depth mechanism remains to be further investigated. The high stability of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs toward ethanol endows them with wide application prospects.

(c) PL spectra of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs with 300 μL ethanol and without ethanol. (d) PL spectra of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs with different amounts of K-OA. 
Since K+ ions have the same valence and comparable ionic radii as those of Cs+ ions, K+ ions were used to passivate the CsPbBr3 perovskite NCs to improve the stability and PLQY.58 Hence, it was expected that the stability and PLQY of the Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs can be attempted to be promoted by using K-OA. As shown in Fig. 4d, 10 μL of K-OA solution was the optimal dose for enhancing the PLQY, otherwise, the best improvement could not be achieved. As shown in Fig. 5, in our present work, no obvious improvement was found in terms of the stability of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs upon adding K-OA, which needs further studies.

Conclusions
In summary, Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs were successfully fabricated in the absence of polar solvents, which showed blue emission with dual peaks at 414 nm and 433 nm and a high PLQY of 29.6% and narrow FWHM of 50 nm. These Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs could be purified using acetone, implying a satisfactory performance among the lead-free perovskite NCs. Additionally, Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs demonstrated excellent air stability and the PLQY would increase during storage under ambient conditions, which may be ascribed to the self-passivation effect of the hydrolytic product BiOBr on surface defects. Furthermore, the PLQY of Cs3Bi2Br9 NCs could be improved by adding a certain amount of K-OA solution. With this controlled synthesis paired with their promising properties, all-inorganic lead-free Cs3Bi2Br9 perovskite NCs may have a significant impact on future optoelectronics.
