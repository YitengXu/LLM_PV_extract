    , Accepted 25th January 2023First published on 28th January 2023AbstractThe incorporation of fused perylene diimides (PDIs) as an acceptor (A) block into the polymer backbone was proved to be effective in reducing the aggregation of molecules to form better size domains. However, photovoltaic devices based on these polymers have a low open-circuit voltage (VOC), which greatly limits their ability to achieve higher performance. Herein, a fused PDI dimer (TBDPDI) was used for constructing two acceptor polymers, P(TBDPDI-TT) and P(TBDPDI-FTT). Polymer P(TBDPDI-TT) was expected to be a good electron acceptor for its strong absorption at 350–700 nm, maximum extinction coefficient of up to 7.06 × 104 M−1 cm−1, and high lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels (−3.81 eV). When blended with PTB7-Th, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) based on P(TBDPDI-TT) showed a high VOC of 0.936 V, which was one of the highest values in the family of PDIs. A series of studies, including device optimization, dependence on light intensity, exciton dissociation, carrier mobility, and atomic force microscopy (AFM), were carried out to distinguish between the P(TBDPDI-TT)- and P(TBDPDI-FTT)-based all-PSCs. The results suggested that the PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-TT) device possessed better charge transport, higher and more balanced carrier mobility, less exciton recombination loss, and more favorable film morphology. Therefore, the PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-TT) device had a higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) compared to the PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-FTT) device. These results suggested that the use of TBDPDI as an A block was an effective strategy to construct polymers with high LUMO energy levels.
Introduction
All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) have received increasing attention in recent years due to their excellent mechanical robustness, morphological stability, and flexibility.1–7 Many cases of all-PSCs with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 15% have been reported.8–15 In contrast to the diversity of donor polymers, excellent acceptor polymers are rare. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a variety of acceptor polymers with different structures to match various donor polymers.16,17
Perylene diimide (PDI) is an excellent building block for acceptor polymers because of its high absorption coefficients, strong electron-withdrawing properties, suitable energy levels, and outstanding photo and thermal stability.18–21 Unsubstituted PDIs have a large planar conjugated core whose strong aggregation does not allow for an appropriate domain size in organic solar cells. However, functionalized PDIs cause twisted geometry due to steric congestion in the bay region, which often tempers the crystallinity and electron mobility of the acceptor polymers.22–28
Incorporating a fused PDI dimer in the center into the polymer backbone has been proved to be effective in reducing the aggregation of molecules to form better domain sizes, and their photovoltaic performance is much better than PDI polymer (PDI-diTh, Fig. 1).29,30 The acceptor polymers based on the above fused PDIs include NDP-V, PFPDI-T, PFPDI-2T, and PFPDI-BDT.2,30,31 (Fig. 1) These acceptor polymers achieved better performance, indicating the good potential of fused PDIs as the key building blocks for acceptor polymers. Although the polymers mentioned above achieved attractive PCEs, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) in all-PSCs are only in the range of 0.70–0.78 V,21,32–34 which greatly limits PDI polymers to achieve better performance. Hence, we are interested in modification of fused PDIs to improve the VOC of relevant photovoltaic devices.35–38
 Fig. 1  Chemical structure, PCE, and VOC of the representative polymeric acceptors, with PTB7-Th as the donor. 
Perylene diimides have large conjugation planes, leading to severe molecular stacking, which is not conducive to charge transport. Therefore, distorted conformations are needed to break the strong aggregation of molecules and thus facilitate the charge transport. In our previous work,39 we found that TBDPDI (the chemical structure is shown in Fig. S1, ESI†) with two PDIs and a benzene ring fused together has a large rigid conjugate core, high absorption, high lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level (in the range of −3.70 to −3.75 eV), and suitable degree of distortion. These results show that TBDPDI can play a key role in achieving high VOC in photovoltaic devices as an acceptor (A) block of the acceptor polymers.
As shown in Scheme 1, compound 8 was synthesized from commercially available perylene dianhydride in a seven-step synthesis. The regio-isomers of monomers (compound 8) in this work cannot be identified by NMR and cannot be separated by column or recrystallization. Herein, we report two new acceptor polymers P(TBDPDI-TT) and P(TBDPDI-FTT) based on the TBDPDI block. It is found that the performance of the PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-TT)-based photovoltaic device is higher than that of the PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-FTT)-based photovoltaic device, because P(TBDPDI-TT) has a high LUMO energy level and a more suitable domain size. The PCE of the all-PSCs fabricated with P(TBDPDI-TT) as the acceptor and PTB7-Th as the donor was 5.69% with an VOC of up to 0.936 V. This is one of the highest VOC values for PTB7-Th based all-PSCs.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes of the fused PDI polymeric monomer compound 8, and acceptor polymers P(TBDPDI-TT) and P(TBDPDI-FTT) are shown in Scheme 1. Compound 7 was synthesized in six steps from perylene-3,4,9,10-(tetracarboxylic)dianhydride as the initial raw material. Large quantities of polymeric monomers (compound 8) were obtained by highly efficient bromination reactions. Two polymers, P(TBDPDI-TT) and P(TBDPDI-FTT), were obtained via a Stille polymerization reaction using Pd2(dba)3 and P(o-tol)3 as the catalyst and the ligand, respectively. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polymer dispersity index of the two polymers were determined by high temperature gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) and were 38.1 kDa/2.19 of P(TBDPDI-TT) and 25.5 kDa/2.48 of P(TBDPDI-FTT) (see Table S1, ESI†). Both polymers showed good solubility (larger than 16 mg mL−1) in chloroform and chlorobenzene. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Two polymers displayed good stability with a decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) over 340 °C. The good thermal stability facilitated its application in the semiconductor field.40,41
Optical properties and energy levels
The UV-vis absorption profiles of P(TBDPDI-TT) and P(TBDPDI-FTT) in diluted chloroform solutions are shown in Fig. 2(a). Their absorption profiles were similar (at 400–650 nm). The calculated maximum extinction coefficient (ε) for P(TBDPDI-TT) and P(TBDPDI-FTT) were 7.06 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (512 nm) and 6.39 × 104 M−1 cm−1 (514 nm), respectively. The film absorption profiles are shown in Fig. 2(b). The maximum absorption peaks of P(TBDPDI-TT) and P(TBDPDI-FTT) films were 517 and 523 nm, respectively. The two polymers exhibited similar film absorption ranges, suggesting that fluorination and non-fluorination of the donor (D) block don’t significantly affect the change in the absorption spectra. All data are listed in Table 1. Polymers P(TBDPDI-TT) and P(TBDPDI-FTT) were medium-bandgap acceptor polymers, as is indicated by the calculated Eoptg values of 1.86 and 1.83 eV. The fluorescence emission spectra of P(TBDPDI-TT) and P(TBDPDI-FTT) in CHCl3 are shown in Fig. 2(c), and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. Both P(TBDPDI-TT) and P(TBDPDI-FTT) acceptor polymers have near-infrared fluorescence with fluorescence quantum yields of 15% and 23%, respectively.

The energy levels of the two polymers were determined by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry, using Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and the ferrocene as the internal standard.42 The corresponding data are listed in Table 1.
Photovoltaic properties
To explore the photovoltaic properties of these two acceptor polymers, we fabricated all-PSC devices with matched energy levels by using different kinds of donor materials (PTB7-Th, PBDB-T and J52), respectively (Table S1, ESI†). All the devices were characterized under simulated AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2).44 It is found that among these donor polymers, PTB7-Th provided better absorption complementarity and energy level matching with two acceptor polymers (Fig. S4, ESI†), resulting in higher PCE and VOC. To further investigate the photovoltaic performance of all-PSCs, the photovoltaic performance of conventional and inverted devices was compared (Table S2, ESI†), and finally indium-tin-oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-TT) or PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-FTT)/perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide (PDINO)/Ag was prepared (Fig. S4d, ESI†). The preparing conditions were carefully screened, including the concentration of the active materials, the donor to acceptor weight ratio, different additives, and thermal annealing temperature. The experimental results were summarized in Tables S3–S6 (ESI†). The optimal preparation conditions of the devices are as follows. The donor:acceptor (D:A) weight ratio was 1:1, and solution concentration was 20 mg mL−1 (chlorobenzene); 5% v/v chloronaphthalene (CN) was added, and thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min was performed.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the all-PSCs devices based on the two polymeric acceptors are shown in Fig. 3(a), and the relevant device performance parameters are shown in Table 2. It is found that the device based on PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-TT) demonstrated a high PCE of 5.69% with a VOC of 0.936 V, a current density (JSC) of 13.75 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 44.19%, while the PCE of the PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-FTT) device was 4.75% with a VOC of 0.879 V, a JSC of 12.70 mA cm−2, and a FF of 42.54%. Notably, the difference in the PCE between P(TBDPDI-TT)- and P(TBDPDI-FTT)-based devices was mainly due to their different VOCs. In addition, we have compared the device performance differences between fused PDI copolymer and non-fused PDI copolymer (PDI-diTh, Fig. 1). We found that the non-fused PDI copolymer PDI-diTh with PTB7-Th as the donor showed only a 1.42% PCE.45 This result suggested that the strategy of increasing the coplanarity of PDI polymers by fusing PDI units was very effective in improving the photovoltaic performance of polymeric PDI-based all-PSCs.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves are shown in Fig. 3(b). The two devices exhibit photon responsive signals in the range of 300–750 nm, among which the signal in 300–550 nm was mainly contributed by the acceptor and the signal from 550–750 nm was contributed by the donor. The JSC integrated from the EQE values of the PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-TT) device was 12.79 mA cm−2, which was higher than the 12.12 mA cm−2 of the PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-FTT) device. This result was consistent with the JSC measurements for two devices.
Studies of carrier mobility, exciton dissociation, and charge carrier recombination behavior
The space charge-limited current (SCLC) method46 was applied to characterize electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) of pristine films and blend films. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table S6 (ESI†), the pristine films of P(TBDPDI-TT) (μe of 8.64 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) showed a slightly higher μe than P(PTBDPDI-FTT) (μe of 7.67 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). We also found the same trend in blend films. The PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-TT) blend exhibited μe of 4.27 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μh of 7.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh/μe = 1.72). The PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-FTT) blend exhibited μe of 3.62 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μh of 6.51 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh/μe = 1.80). Higher and balanced carrier mobility indicates that the PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-TT) blend had better charge transport properties, which was consistent with its higher FF.

To further investigate the charge generation and exciton dissociation of the PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-TT) and PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-FTT) devices, J–V tests were carried out under simulated sunlight irradiation and light-sheltered conditions over a voltage range of −4 V to 1.5 V.47 The exciton dissociation probability equation is Pdiss = Jmaxph/Jsat × 100% (Jmaxph: Jph corresponding to maximum output power; Jsat: saturation current). The exciton dissociation probability of the PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-TT) and PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-FTT) devices were 51.86% and 51.13%, respectively. This result demonstrated that the exciton dissociation and charge extraction were more efficient in the PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-TT)-based all-PSCs.
To study the charge transport and recombination process in PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-TT) and PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-FTT) devices, eight different light intensities (Plight) in the range of 20–100 mW cm−2 were chosen to test the J–V performance separately.48 The relationship between VOC and Plight can be expressed as VOC ∝ (kT q−1) ln(Plight), where k is the Boltzmann's constant and T is thermodynamic temperature. The linear fitting curves of VOCversus Plight are shown in Fig. 4(e) that show that trap-assisted recombination is more while the slope of the curve approaches approximately 2 kT q−1. The slopes were 2.22 of the PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-TT) device and 2.23 kT q−1 of the PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-FTT) device. A high slope indicates that trap-assisted recombination dominates the whole charge carrier recombination dynamic progress. Moreover, the relationship between JSC and Plight can be described as a power–law equation JSC ∝ Pαlight, and the higher slope value (α) represented less bimolecular recombination. The slope of the PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-TT) device was 0.62, which was slightly higher than that of the PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-TT) device (0.61). Above studies demonstrated that the PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-TT) device had less trap-assisted recombination and bimolecular recombination than the PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-FTT) device.
Morphology studies
To further investigate the performance difference between P(TBDPDI-TT)- and P(TBDPDI-FTT)-based photovoltaic devices, we measured atomic force microscopy (AFM, Fig. 5) images of PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-TT) and PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-FTT) blend films. The PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-TT) and PTB7-Th:P(TBDPDI-FTT) blends were found to have similar active layer morphology and room-mean-square surface (RMS) roughness (1.24 vs. 1.17 nm). This result indicates that two blends had well-dispersed fibrillated structures and bi-continuous interpenetrating networks. This active layer morphology was conducive to the improvement of charge transport and inhibition of charge recombination.

Conclusions
In summary, two acceptor polymers P(TBDPDI-TT) and P(TBDPDI-FTT) were obtained successfully. Both of them have high LUMO energy levels. A high VOC (0.936 V) was obtained in P(TBDPDI-TT)-based all-PSCs. This study demonstrates that the fusing PDI unit to form the large coplanar aromatic system is an effective strategy for improving VOC of all-PSCs based on PDI acceptor polymers. Moreover, TBDPDI was shown to be a good electron-withdrawing block in the construction of high-performance polymeric acceptors.
