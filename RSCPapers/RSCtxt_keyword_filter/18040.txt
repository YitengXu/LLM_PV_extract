    , Accepted 23rd September 2020First published on 24th September 2020AbstractFuture flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) require high efficiency, good flexibility and low fabrication cost. Here, we demonstrate a metal oxide-free flexible OSC based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) anodes with a small amount of perchloric acid (HClO4) spray doping. The optimized flexible OSCs yield a mean efficiency of 16.44%, which is the highest value for metal oxide-free flexible OSCs reported so far. The high efficiency is ascribed to the HClO4 spray doping that pulls the anode's Fermi level down, decreases the sheet resistances, and induces an intimate contact at interfaces. The spray doping also avoids direct contact between HClO4 and plastic substrates, and thus the devices maintain good flexibility. This work clearly demonstrates the advantage of the unique HClO4 spray doping method over the well-known strong acid soaking method and complicated transfer-printing strategies for application in anodes of flexible OSCs.
Introduction
Flexible organic solar cells (OSCs) have become a popular research field, owing to the advantages of low cost, light weight, ease of fabrication, wearability, portability, etc.1–14 Transparent electrode fabrication is regarded as a core process that determines the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and the fabrication cost.15 As recent breakthroughs in OSCs have achieved OSCs that deliver >17% efficiency,16–18 efforts have been devoted to electrode fabrication to achieve highly efficient and flexible OSCs. For example, Sun et al.9 showed 13.1%-efficiency single-junction flexible OSCs and 16.5%-efficiency tandem flexible OSCs via using water-processed silver nanowires (AgNWs) with poly(sodium styrenesulfonate) (PSSNa). Chen et al.10 reported a highly flexible OSC with a mean efficiency of 14.93% and a maximum value of 15.21% through using the hybrid electrodes of Al-doped zinc oxide (ZnO) and AgNWs. The results shed light on potential commercialization of flexible OSCs. However, high costs of AgNWs (>10 USD mL−1),19 the intrinsic fragility of metal oxides such as ZnO and indium tin oxide (ITO),20,21 and the potential corrosion caused by the acidic PSSNa might hamper the adaptation of flexible OSCs.
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is a promising transparent electrode, owing to its low cost, high transparency, good flexibility, smoothness, etc.19,22–26 The optical and electrical characteristics of the polymeric electrodes were improved to the required levels (35–50 Ω sq−1 with ∼90% transmittance at 550 nm) through using strong acid soaking and dopant blending treatments.16,22–24,27,28 Among these treatments, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) soaking is one of the best pathways to prepare highly conductive PEDOT:PSS electrodes.22,23 However, H2SO4 destroyed the underlying plastic substrates used for flexible device integration,23,25–28 because of the strong oxidizing and powerful dehydrating properties of H2SO4. To solve this problem, Ouyang et al.29 proposed a mild acid soaking treatment using 8.0 M methanesulfonic acid (CH3SO3H) for the first time. However, the treatment at high temperatures (≥120 °C) caused a loss in the flexibility of plastic substrates and led to a work function of 4.80 eV for the electrodes.30 Fan et al.31,32 developed a room-temperature >99.5 wt% CH3SO3H soaking treatment. The soaked PEDOT:PSS films exhibited a moderate conductivity (∼80 Ω sq−1 with 90% transmittance) and a work function of 4.91 eV. Notably, the work function is not high enough to match the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of electron donors of the active blends for charge extraction in their nonfullerene flexible OSCs, which showed an initial PCE of 10.03% and withstood gentle flexing tests at a bending radius (r) of 5.6 mm.32 To avoid direct contact between strong acids and plastic substrates, Kim et al.23 proposed a unique ∼98 wt% H2SO4 assisted transfer-printing strategy for fabricating a flexible fullerene OSC with 7.7% efficiency. Nonetheless, transfer-printing strategies were complicated and resulted in low yields of transfer-printed electrodes.26,31,32 Therefore, new doping methods/strategies should be pursed for the realization of high-efficiency flexible OSCs.
A small amount of HClO4 spraying treatment is proposed to chemically dope the PEDOT:PSS films. HClO4 is regarded as the strongest inorganic acid with ultrahigh acidity (pKa: −10) over H2SO4 (pKa: −3.0) and CH3SO3H (pKa: −1.9), thereby providing a strong protonation of hydrogen ions (H+) to insulating PSS for raising the conductivity of the film. Moreover, it's capable of polarizing the PEDOTs in the polymeric matrices to achieve a high work-function anode due to the chlorine oxygen polar bonds of HClO4 with uncoupling charge centers. It probably minimizes the energy level mismatch among the anodes, hole transporting layers and electron donors of active blends for creating small potential batteries at interfaces. Besides, the HClO4 spray doping avoids the direct contact between strong acids and plastic substrates, thereby resulting in a substantial enhancement in device flexibility. Finally, it's very simple, cost-effective, environment friendly without harmful fog generations, and compatible with blading, inkjet printing, screen printing, etc., which bring the polymeric anodes closer to commercial implementations in flexible optoelectronics. This motivates us to explore the use of a small amount of HClO4 spray doping for inventing high-efficiency metal oxide-free flexible OSCs.
Herein, we demonstrated the metal oxide-free flexible OSCs based on 0.1 M HClO4 spray doped PEDOT:PSS anodes. The 0.1 M HClO4 spray doping induced a better phase-separated morphology that consisted of physically continuous and uniform aggregates. It avoided the damage of strong acids to plastic substrates and endowed the anodes with low sheet resistance, a high work function and good wettability. The metal oxide-free flexible OSCs yielded a mean PCE of 16.44%, which was comparable to that (PCE: 16.89%) of the control OSCs fabricated on ITO/glass substrates. Besides, the solar cells retained 93.6% of the initial PCE in the 1000 cycle harsh flexing tests at a r of 1.5 mm, demonstrating superior mechanical flexibility.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a presents the schematic illustration of the HClO4 spray doping for preparing the PEDOT:PSS anodes on ∼100 μm-thick polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates. The HClO4 aqueous solutions have a low concentration of 0.1–1.0 M. Unlike ∼98 wt% H2SO4 and >99.5 wt% CH3SO3H aqueous solutions, the 0.1 M (∼1.0 wt%) HClO4 aqueous solution with a low viscosity is suitable for the spray coating for preparing a smooth polymeric electrode with less strong acid residuals. Fig. 1b shows the inter-molecular interactions among oxidized PEDOT molecules, insulating PSS molecules, and HClO4. Oxidized PEDOT is highly conductive and it's dispersed in water by PSS through the formation of ionic bonds. The HClO4 molecules containing chlorine oxygen bonds polarized the as-cast polymeric films. Simultaneously, the HClO4 molecules combined well with the PSS components of PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) and PEDOT:PSS (P VP AI4083) through the formation of hydrogen bonds.

(e) Rsh of the HClO4 treated anodes. (f) Optical transmittance of the as-cast films and 0.1 M HClO4 sprayed anodes on PET substrates. 
As displayed in Fig. 1c, after the 0.1 M HClO4 treatment, the contact angle was visibly decreased from ∼32° to ∼17°, demonstrating a substantial increase of the PEDOT:PSS film's wettability. It suggested intimate contact between the hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) anodes and the buffer layers of PEDOT:PSS (P VP AI4083). Fig. 1d shows the XRD spectra of the as-cast films and the films with the HClO4 treatments at room temperature followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. The as-cast films had no obvious diffraction peak, demonstrating a much lower crystallinity of PEDOT molecules. However the HClO4 sprayed films showed four strong diffraction peaks at 6.2°, 12.2°, 19.0° and 26.0°, demonstrating a large enhancement in the crystallinity of PEDOT molecules. The high crystallinity of the PEDOT molecules can make the charge hopping easier, eventually resulting in a tremendous enhancement in the electrical conductivity of the anodes.

Fig. 1e and f show the sheet resistance (Rsh) and optical transparency (T%) at λ = 350–950 nm of the HClO4 sprayed PEDOT:PSS anodes, respectively. Obviously, all the polymeric films exhibited a low Rsh of 28.2–29.8 Ω sq−1. It should be noted that the PEDOT:PSS coated plastic substrates were destroyed or became fragile by ∼98 wt% H2SO4 soaking treatments, 66.7 wt% nitric acid soaking treatments, and 1.0 M H2SO4 soaking treatments at 160 °C.23,26–29 Here, the unique 0.1 M HClO4 spray doping is desirable for making flexible polymeric anodes on plastic substrates, because it avoided the direct contact between HClO4 and plastic substrates as well as used the 0.1 M HClO4 aqueous solution (only ∼1.0 wt%) for doping. Upon the 0.1 M HClO4 treatment, the PEDOT:PSS anodes exhibited an average Rsh as low as 29.4 Ω sq−1 (corresponding to an electrical conductivity of 4250 S cm−1). Notably, five samples were prepared for confirming the average values. The hydrogen ions that were ionized from HClO4 led to strong protonation of the insulating PSS components, and HClO4 might induce more oxidized PEDOT molecules for high crystallization, contributing to the low sheet resistances of the anodes.
The polymeric anodes coated on the PET substrates showed a high optical transparency that was almost independent of the doping concentrations. After the 0.1 M HClO4 doping, T% was increased from 88.7% to 90.3% at λ = 550 nm, which was accompanied by an evolution of phase-separated morphologies and potential formation of crystallized PEDOT molecules. With the 0.1 M HClO4 doping, the polymeric films coated on the PET substrates exhibited high optical transparencies over 86% in the visible regions of 400–1000 nm. It had been reported that strong acid soaking treatments caused more strong acid residues, which limited interface contact and led to uniformity issues, mainly attributed to a high viscosity of the high-concentration acids employed and a large removal of hydrophilic PSS from the polymeric matrix.26–28,31,32 Herein, the small amount of HClO4 spray doping can solve this problem, and induce hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS films with excellent optical and electrical characteristics.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning probe microscope (SPM) images were used to characterize the quality of the doped polymeric films. We investigated the TEM images of the as-cast PEDOT:PSS films, the control films with the >99.5 wt% CH3SO3H soaking treatments at room temperature, and the films after 0.1 M HClO4 spraying treatment at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 2a, the as-cast films exhibited a poor phase-segregated morphology with weak aggregates. With the CH3SO3H soaking treatment, the polymeric films exhibited continuous networks consisting of aggregates with major sizes of 30–50 nm, as shown in Fig. 2b and ESI Fig. S1.† In the previous report regarding the aggregates of the CH3SO3H doped PEDOT:PSS films, the major sizes were 20–40 nm.31 The better morphology could reduce energy barriers and lead to free charge-carrier hopping. With the small amount of HClO4 spraying treatment, the PEDOT:PSS anodes showed physically continuous and uniformly distributed aggregates with small sizes no more than 30 nm (see Fig. 2c and d). As shown in Fig. 2d, the small aggregates were well connected to form physically continuous networks, suggesting a favorable phase-segregated morphology.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to probe the contents of the film's components. Traditionally, the XPS bands with binding energies of 166–172 eV originated from the sulfonate moieties of PSS (SPSS); and the XPS bands with binding energies of 162–166 eV originated from the thiophene rings (SPEDOT) of PEDOT. Fig. 3a shows the S2p XPS of the as-cast PEDOT:PSS films. It shows that the ratio of S of sulfonate moieties (SPSS) to total S atoms is 77.1 atom% for the as-cast films. After 0.1 M and 1.0 M HClO4 treatments, the ratio of SPSS decreased to 66.4 and 62.5 atom%, respectively, suggesting limited removal of the insulating PSS components from PEDOT:PSS matrices. In previous studies,22,27,30,31 strong acid soaking treatments commonly induced a hyrdrophobic PEDOT:PSS film because of large removal of hydrophilic PSS components, thereby causing an interface contact issue. Here, the small amount of HClO4 spray doping has a striking advantage of increasing the wettability of the films over the commonly used strong acid soaking treatments, attributed to the limited removal of PSS and the hydroxyl groups provided by HClO4 on the film's surfaces. Fig. 3d displays the Cl2p core energy level spectra of the films with the 0.1 M and 1.0 M HClO4 treatments. It shows that the Cl content of the films is 3.27 and 3.68 atom%, respectively, demonstrating the existence of HClO4 molecules on the surfaces of the doped films. The spray doping of 0.1 M HClO4 led to a relatively low content of HClO4 on the film's surfaces. The HClO4 molecules play a key role of polarizing the PEDOT molecules for adjusting the work functions of the polymeric anodes discussed below.

We fabricated the metal oxide-free flexible OSCs with a structure of PET substrate/HClO4 doped PEDOT:PSS (PH1000, ∼80 nm)/PEDOT:PSS (P VP AI4083)/PM6:Y6 (∼150 nm)33,34/perylene diimide amino N-oxide (PDINO)35 or aliphatic amine-functionalized perylene-diimide (PDINN, ∼10 nm)36/Al (∼100 nm), where the PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) films with the HClO4 spray doping were used as transparent anodes, and PDINN and PDINO were employed as electron transporting layers (ETLs). The molecular structures of PEDOT:PSS, PDINN and PDINO are shown in Fig. S2.†

Fig. 4b and c show the J–V curves of the metal oxide-free flexible devices with the anodes sprayed with 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 M HClO4 under the illumination of AM1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. We used two ETLs, including PDINO and PDINN, to optimize the device efficiency. The performance data of the flexible devices are summarized in Table 1 for reference. We found that the PDINN ETLs are superior to the PDINO ETLs in terms of device efficiency. This may be attributed to the high electrical conductivity (5 × 10−4 S cm−1) of PDINN and a work function tuning effect that allows low work function metals (e.g., Ag and Cu) to act as cathodes.36 For the flexible OSCs with PDINO or PDINN buffer layers, the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) are almost independent of the doping concentrations. The optimized flexible OSCs with PDINN exhibited a mean efficiency of 16.44% with a VOC of 0.850 V, a JSC of 25.83 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.748, which was comparable to that (PCE: 16.89%) of the control rigid OSCs fabricated on (∼110 nm) ITO/glass substrates. To the best of our knowledge, 16.44% is the highest PCE for single-junction flexible OSCs reported in the literature, so far (see Fig. S3 and Table S1†). As shown in Fig. 4d, the rigid devices based on ITO exhibited a VOC of 0.850 V, a JSC of 25.96 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.765. The results demonstrate that the 0.1 M HClO4 sprayed anodes are suitable for fabricating high-efficiency metal oxide-free flexible OSCs. Fig. 4e shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) plots of the optimized flexible OSCs based on the PEDOT:PSS anodes with the 0.1 M HClO4 treatment and the control rigid OSCs based on ITO anodes. The EQE values are consistent with the JSC values of the devices. The maximum EQE value reached 82.6% at 560 nm for the flexible devices, which demonstrated a high JSC of 25.83 mA cm−2. The integrated current density is measured to be 25.54 mA cm−2 for the flexible device (Fig. S4†), which is well consistent with the results. The EQE value at 560 nm increased to 85.4% for the rigid devices based on ITO, which showed a high JSC of 25.96 mA cm−2.

In contrast, two control flexible OSCs with 180 nm-thick ITO anodes and the PEDOT:PSS anodes with >99.5 wt% CH3SO3H treatments were fabricated. Fig. 4f shows the J–V characteristics of the control flexible devices. It presented that the flexible devices with the CH3SO3H doped anodes exhibited a low VOC of 0.830 V whereas the flexible OSCs with the small amount of HClO4 sprayed PEDOT:PSS anodes exhibited a high VOC increased by 20 mV, which was attributed to a small potential barrier induced by the raised work function of the HClO4 sprayed anodes investigated below. The dependence of VOC on light intensity, giving a relationship of VOC ∝ (nkT/q)ln(Plight), was employed to evaluate the carrier recombination behavior. The smaller ideal factor of n = 1.45 for flexible OSCs with the HClO4-treated PEDOT:PSS anodes suggested that the active layers coated on the high-quality PEDOT:PSS anodes could suppress trap-assisted recombination (Fig. S5†).37,38 Besides, owing to the limited electrical and optical characteristics of both anodes (Rsh: 40 Ω sq−1 and T%: 86% at 550 nm for the CH3SO3H treated anodes; and Rsh: ∼200 Ω sq−1 and T%: 81% at 550 nm for the ITO anodes), the control flexible OSCs with the CH3SO3H-treated anodes showed a series resistance of 4.6 Ω cm2, higher than that (3.0 Ω cm2) of the devices with the HClO4-treated anodes, thereby leading to a relatively low FF and JSC (Fig. S6†).
An energy level tuning effect induced by HClO4 plays a key role of determining the device efficiency. Fig. 5a shows the ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) of three kinds of films including the as-cast PEDOT:PSS films, the 0.1 M HClO4 sprayed anodes, and the 0.1 M HClO4 sprayed anodes coated with PEDOT:PSS (P VP AI4083). Fig. 5b and c present the low kinetic energy cutoff (Ecutoff) and the Fermi levels (EFermi) of the films, respectively. The work functions were measured using the formula given below:Φ = hν + Ecutoff − EFermiwhere hν is 21.22 eV. We found that the as-cast films had a Φ of 4.97 eV, which was consistent with that (5.0 eV) of the pristine PEDOT:PSS films without any doping reported before.30 With the HClO4 treatment, the anodes had a Φ of 5.39 eV, which was much higher than the values (4.80 eV (ref. 30) and 4.91 eV (ref. 32)) of the anodes with 8.0 M CH3SO3H treatments at ≥120 °C and >99.5 wt% CH3SO3H treatments at room temperature. In addition, chlorobenzoic acid doping treatments increased the Φ of ITO electrodes from 4.77 to 5.02 eV;39 and trifluoromethanesulfonamide doping treatments increased the Φ of graphene electrodes from 4.4 to 5.1 eV.40 Both dopants with the electron withdrawing halogens (Cl and F atoms) led to the interfacial dipoles pointing toward photo-active layers. Here, the high Φ (5.39 eV) of the HClO4 doped anodes was attributed to the chlorine oxygen polar bonds of HClO4 that are capable of polarizing the conducting PEDOT molecules. When the PEDOT:PSS (P VP AI4083) buffer layers were coated on the anodes, the Φ of the bi-layer films became 5.24 eV. Obviously, the small offset between the work function (5.39 eV) of the anodes and the HOMO (5.50 eV) of PM6 maximized the charge extraction and minimized the recombination losses at interfaces; and it's energetically favorable for charge transport from PM6:Y6 active layers to the anodes (see Fig. 5d), resulting in an enhanced built-in field for a high JSC and VOC in the flexible solar cells.

(e) Decays of normalized PCEs of the flexible OSCs in the continuous flexing test. (f) R/R0 of the HClO4 sprayed PEDOT:PSS/PET, the CH3SO3H soaked PEDOT:PSS/PET, and the ITO/PET as a function of bending cycles. 
The OSCs have a better mechanical flexibility, owing to the small amount of HClO4 spray doping that avoided the contact between HClO4 and the underlying plastic substrates. Hence, we investigated the profiles of the PCEs of the metal oxide-free flexible OSCs as a function of bending cycles at a small bending radius of 1.5 mm. As shown in Fig. 5e, there is no obvious decrease in the PCEs of the devices with 0.1 M HClO4 treated anodes in the initial flexing for 100 cycles. After the bending tests for 1000 cycles, the average PCE only dropped by ∼6.4%. The results demonstrate the high bending stability of the devices with the HClO4 treated anodes. The small amount of HClO4 spray doping can avoid direct contact between the strong acids and the PET substrates, and prohibit deep penetration of HClO4 into the plastic substrates which leads to destructive corrosion.
In contrast, we also investigated the mechanical flexibility of the flexible OSCs with the >99.5 wt% CH3SO3H soaked PEDOT:PSS anodes and the ITO anodes (∼180 nm), respectively. The profiles of PCEs versus the bending cycles are presented in Fig. 5e. Obviously, the devices with the CH3SO3H treated anodes showed a large decay in the PCE in the flexing tests at a r of 1.5 mm. The decayed efficiency originated from the decreased JSC and FF. After 1000 bending cycles, the PCE dropped to ∼15.8% of the initial value while the PCE of the ITO-based devices failed to operate in the tests, which was attributed to the intrinsic brittleness of ITO anodes with cracks, which hampered the charge-carrier transport and collection. Therefore, the HClO4 treated anodes outperformed the CH3SO3H treated anodes and the ITO anodes in terms of device flexibility.
We further prepared three types of samples, including 0.1 M HClO4 sprayed PEDOT:PSS/PET, >99.5 wt% CH3SO3H soaked PEDOT:PSS/PET, and ITO/PET (size: 2.0 × 2.0 cm2) for the electrical behavior characterization. Silver paste was coated on the two edges of the samples. Fig. 5f shows the final resistance/initial resistance (R/R0) values of the samples as a function of the number of bending cycles at a r of 1.5 mm. The resistance of the ITO sample increases by 2 orders of magnitude (from ∼200 to over 104 Ω) after 200 bending cycles, suggesting a crack propagation of ITO anodes in the harsh bending tests. However the PEDOT:PSS/PET samples with HClO4 spraying treatments hold low resistances that only increase by ∼22% in the bending tests for 1000 cycles, that can be attributed to continuous conducting pathways of the PEDOT:PSS anodes. The samples with the CH3SO3H soaking treatments exhibited resistances increased by ∼141% after bending, which originated from the loss in the mechanical flexibility of the PET substrates in the CH3SO3H soaking process, which meant, the CH3SO3H treatments caused brittleness of the plastic substrates. The results demonstrate that the small amount of HClO4 spray treatment has the advantage of protecting the underlying plastic substrates and raising the mechanical flexibility of the devices over the conventional acid soaking treatments. It's also much simpler than transfer-printing strategies. On the basis of the results, we envision that the flexible polymeric anodes with the small amount of HClO4 spray doping are also useful in other types of flexible optoelectronics, owing to their striking features of conductivity, wettability, work function, and mechanical flexibility.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated metal oxide-free flexible OSCs with a mean efficiency of 16.44% and an excellent flexibility. The high efficiency can be attributed to the usage of PEDOT:PSS anodes with a unique 0.1 M HClO4 spray doping and PDINN buffer layers. The chemical doping endowed the anodes with 29.4 Ω sq−1 sheet resistance, 90.4% transmittance at λ = 550 nm, and a better hydrophilicity for intimate interface contact (contact angle: ∼17°). It also induced an energy level tuning effect through polarizing the PEDOT molecules, resulting in a work function as high as 5.39 eV. The small offset between the work function of the anodes and the HOMO of PM6 maximized charge extractions and minimized recombination losses, leading to an improved PCE. Furthermore, the flexible devices withstood the harsh 1000 cycle flexing tests at a r of 1.5 mm, demonstrating high flexibility, because the unique small amount of HClO4 spray doping can avoid the direct contact between the strong acids and the PET substrates. This work paves the way to realize PEDOT:PSS anodes with high conductivity, suitable work functions and high flexibility, suitable for high-performance flexible OSCs and other optoelectronic devices.
Experimental
Materials
PM6 and Y6 were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc, Beijing. PEDOT:PSS aqueous solutions (i.e., Clevios PH1000 and Clevios P VP AI4083) were purchased from Heraeus, Germany. The physical properties of both the PEDOT:PSS aqueous solutions are shown in Table S2.† PDINN was provided by Prof. Z. G. Zhang.
Preparation of PEDOT:PSS anodes
PET plastic substrates with a size of 2.0 × 2.0 cm2 were cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized (DI) water, and isopropyl alcohol. Then, the plastic substrates were treated in an oxygen plasma chamber for 2 min. After the 0.45 μm syringe filtering, the PEDOT:PSS aqueous solutions (Clevios PH1000, Heraeus, Germany) were spin-coated at 3000 rpm on the plastic substrates to form as-cast thin layers. Next, the as-cast layers were thermally annealed on a hot plate in the ambient atmosphere at 100 °C for 10 min. Afterward, the HClO4 spray doping was performed by spraying the low-concentration HClO4 aqueous solutions on the film's surfaces followed by a thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. The distance between the spray jets and the as-cast layers is 6 ± 1 cm. To prepare the CH3SO3H treated anodes, the CH3SO3H soaking treatments were performed by soaking the as-cast films into the >99.5 wt% CH3SO3H aqueous solutions at room temperature, and then the layers were washed with DI water twice in a 250 mL beaker followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. Notably, in the process of preparing the HClO4 doped anodes, the washing treatments using DI water weren't used. To make the HClO4 doped anodes, a thin layer of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated on the front thin layer at 3000 rpm and it was subjected to the HClO4 doping treatment.
Device fabrication
A PEDOT:PSS buffer layer (Clevios P VP AI4083) was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS anodes and the ITO anodes at 3000 rpm, and then the buffer layer was dried at 100 °C for 10 min. After that, the active layer blends of PM6:Y6 (1:1.2 w/w, 8.7 mg mL−1 for Y6) were dissolved in chloroform with 1-chloronaphthalene (0.5%, v/v) and were spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s onto the PEDOT:PSS (P VP AI4083) buffer layers. PDINO or PDINN in methanol (1.0 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the surfaces of the active layers at 2000 rpm to obtain the electron transporting layers. Finally, the metal cathodes of Al (∼100 nm) were thermally evaporated under a pressure at 10−4 Pa. The active area of the devices is measured to be 6.00 mm2. Metal probes were brought into contact with Al top cathodes and the PEDOT:PSS bottom electrodes coated with Ag paste for measuring J–V characteristics.
Characterization
The thicknesses of the films and plastic substrates were measured using a surface profile-meter (Talysurf Series II) and a micrometer, respectively. The electrical contact was made using silver paste and indium materials on the four corners of each PEDOT:PSS film. The sheet resistance was determined by using the van der Pauw four-point probing method with a Keithley 2400 source/meter. Optical transmittance was measured on a Hitachi U-3010 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The film morphology was investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TECNAI G20, FEI) and SPM (VEECO Dimension 3100V). The compositions and chemical states of the PEDOT:PSS films were examined by XPS (XSAM800). UPS measurements were conducted using a Kratos AXIS ULTRA DALD UPS system. The J–V characteristics of the flexible organic solar cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (Newport 91160, 300W, solar simulator equipped with an AM1.5 filter). The light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell. External quantum efficiency was measured through a Newport quantum efficiency measurement system (ORIEL IQE 200™) in the air atmosphere. The light intensity was calibrated using a standard Si/Ge solar cell.
