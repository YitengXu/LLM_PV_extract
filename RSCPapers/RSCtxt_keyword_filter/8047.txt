    AbstractIt has been previously shown that incorporating alcohol/water-soluble conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) as cathode interlayers can substantially enhance the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs). This improvement is attractive since there are only a few solution-based processing technologies that can enhance the Voc. In this article, the Voc enhancement effect of five distinct CPE materials was studied on three typical PSC device configurations, each using different donor materials. Significant Voc enhancement was observed in devices that contain a polyfluorene copolymer as the donor material. The origin of the Voc enhancement was investigated by examination of the dark currents.
Introduction
Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) have recently exceeded 7%,1 attracting intense attention from both scientific and industrial communities. However, it remains a grand challenge to further improve the PCEs of PSCs up to 10%,2 which is a desirable range for large-scale practical applications. The PCE (ηp) is determined by three parameters: the open-circuit voltage (Voc), the short-circuit current density (Jsc), and the fill factor (FF) via  where Pin is the incident light power. To improve the overall PCE, most research has focused on increasing FF and Jsc by means of increasing light absorption by the active layer3–5 or improving charge mobility of donor/acceptor materials.6,7 Methods for enhancing open-circuit voltage are less well understood and are less frequently reported.
A generally effective way to enhance Voc is to shift the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the acceptor material closer to the vacuum level,8 or to lower the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the donor material away from the vacuum level.9,10 This strategy may compromise other desirable properties, such as the absorption limit, charge separation efficiency and charge mobility.11Voc improvements may also be obtained via interface engineering in a multilayer device configuration. For example, evaporating a thin layer of insulating metal fluoride (such as LiF12,13) between the active layer and the cathode can increase the Voc. To fully exploit the advantages of solution processing, it is desirable to develop solution-processable interface materials that can yield similar results. Zhang et al. first demonstrated that using spin-cast poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) thin film instead of LiF between the active layer and aluminium (Al) cathode can substantially enhance the Voc of PSCs.14 Yip et al. also reported that the interfacial properties of ZnO/cathode contacts can be modified by incorporation of carboxylic acid-based self-assembled molecules of various dipole moments leading to larger Voc values, if proper interlayers were incorporated.15
We recently reported that enhancements of 0.3 V in the Voc of PSCs by inserting a thin layer of alcohol/water-soluble polyelectrolyte between the active layer and the metal electrode. The origin of the Voc increase was attributed to the superposition of the built-in field with the interfacial dipole of the interlayer.16 Other groups also reported using conjugated copolymers or polyelectrolytes (CPEs) as cathode interlayers.17,18 A particular advantage of the use of CPEs in multilayer optoelectronic devices lies in their processability from solvents,19–21 such as methanol and water in which most non-ionic conjugated polymers are insoluble. This feature avoids intermixing between the active layer and the subsequently deposited interlayer and favors fabrication of all-solution-processed devices by, for example, roll-to-roll-processed polymer light-emitting devices (PLEDs) reported by Zeng et al.22 and PSCs by Krebs et al.23 We also note that PSC devices based on the roll-to-roll process are now on the eve of a critical development where round-robins or interlaboratory (IL) studies are possible,23 which make this technology of special interest for practical applications.
The reduction of dark currents through the introduction of organic/inorganic electron-blocking layers at the anode side,24 or via molecular design25 can also increase the Voc. The main goal of this study is to identify the correlation between reduced dark current and the enhanced Voc in PSCs with CPEs as the cathode interlayer.
Experimental
(A) Materials
The donor polymers used for the study are poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorene)-co-(4,7-di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)], with DBT monomer molar ratio of 35% (PFO-DBT35),26 poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)27 and poly(2-methoxy-(2′-ethyl-hexoxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene) (MEH-PPV),28 respectively. The acceptor material is [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM).28 Five alcohol/water-soluble conjugated copolymers or polyelectrolytes, including poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN, see Scheme 1),29 and cationic CPEs denoted as PF-X (where X corresponds to the compensating anions, see Scheme 1)30 were selected as interlayer materials due to their capability to serve as electron injection layers in polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs).

(B) Instrumentation and device fabrication
Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass with a sheet resistance of 15–20 ohm/square were cleaned by a surfactant scrub, then underwent a wet-cleaning process inside an ultrasonic bath, beginning with deionized water, followed by acetone and isopropanol. After oxygen plasma cleaning for 5 min, a 40 nm-thick poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiopene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Bayer Baytron 4083) anode buffer layer was spin-cast onto the ITO substrate and then dried by baking in a vacuum oven at 80 °C overnight. The active layer, with a thickness in the 70–80 nm range, was then deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer, by casting from a chlorobenzene solution containing PFO-DBT35:PCBM (1:4, w/w) or P3HT:PCBM (1:0.8, w/w) or MEH-PPV:PCBM (1:4, w/w). The interlayer material solution in methanol was spin-coated on the top of the obtained active layer to form a thin interlayer of 5 nm. The thickness of the PEDOT:PSS and active layer were verified by a surface profilometer (Tencor, Alpha-500). Determination of the thickness of the interlayer followed a previously published paper20 and thickness control is adjusted by the concentration of the solution and the spin speed between 600 and 2500 rpm. The thickness of the interlayer was determined using a surface profiler (Alfa Step-500, Tencor), in combination with extrapolation from an absorbance–thickness curve that assumes a linear dependence of absorbance at 380 nm on film thickness. Finally, a 100 nm aluminium layer was thermally evaporated with a shadow mask at a base pressure of 3 × 10−4 Pa. The overlapping area between the cathode and anode defined a pixel size of 0.15 cm2. The thickness of the evaporated cathodes was monitored by a quartz crystal thickness/ratio monitor (Model: STM-100/MF, Sycon). Except for the deposition of the PEDOT:PSS layers, all the fabrication processes were carried out inside a controlled atmosphere of nitrogen dry-box (Vacuum Atmosphere Co.) containing less than 10 ppm oxygen and moisture. The power conversion efficiencies of the resulting polymer solar cells were measured under 1 sun, AM 1.5G (air mass 1.5 global) spectrum from a solar simulator (Oriel model 91192) (1000 W m−2). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded with a Keithley 2410 source unit.
Results and discussions
Typical J–V characteristics of the devices containing PFO-DBT35, P3HT and MEH-PPV as donor materials, and PF-Br (5 nm) as the cathode interlayer are presented in Fig. 1. J–V characteristics of control devices with a device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Al are also included for comparison. Consistent with our previous study,16 one observes Voc enhancement only in the PFO-DBT35-based devices (can be as high as 150 mV, 0.90 V vs. 1.05 V), while for P3HT and MEH-PPV devices, no significant enhancement in Voc is found. The obtained Jsc, Voc, FF, and PCE deduced from the J–V characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Furthermore, as seen from Table 1, the enhancement of Voc in PFO-DBT35-based devices is not sensitive to structural variations of the CPE materials. In other words, with the incorporation of the interlayer from all of the conjugated copolymers or polyelectrolytes used in the study, the Voc PFO-DBT35-based devices can be optimized up to 1.05 V. The FF values of the devices with the interlayer also improve slightly over the control devices (50% vs. 47%), resulting in an improved PCE of 1.7–2.0% for PFO-DBT35 devices. It is important to note that incorporating an interlayer that is too thick (i.e. 20 nm, see Table 1) results in decreased performance due to reduced Jsc and FF, likely as a result of increased charge recombination from the reduced electric field across the devices.

In addition to the increased built-in potential, as revealed by the J–V characteristics of the devices in the dark (Fig. 2a), which may contribute to the Voc enhancement in the PFO-DBT35-based devices, we also found that the dark currents with the interlayers were significantly suppressed. These observations imply a reduced loss in the Voc, which can be understood from the physical origin of the Voc of p–n junction solar cells,31,32 with the equivalent circuit shown in Scheme 2. Under illumination, the current density–bias characteristics of the devices can be expressed by the Shockley equation (1)where J is the current density (I the current) flowing through the external resistance load, Jph is the photocurrent, JD the dark current density, Jsh the current density flowing through the shunt resistance Rsh, as shown in Scheme 2, Js the reverse dark saturation current density, n the ideality factor, k the Boltzmann constant and q the elementary charge. Under open-circuit voltage conditions (I,J = 0 and V = Voc), eqn (1) becomes (2)
Thus, for solar cells with very large shunt resistance, the above equation can be further simplified, resulting in: (3)Eqn (3) suggests that, in general, decreasing dark current density JD and a decreasing reverse dark saturation current density Js could help to enhance Voc in the devices. It is worth pointing out that Js and n can be modeled from the dark J–V characteristics (such as Fig. 2) using the Shockley equation, and can therefore be used to predict the Voc dependence on the electrical properties of p–n junction-based solar cells viaeqn (3). However, for bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells, despite the fact that the donor/acceptor interface can be treated as a classical p–n junction,32 the active layer–metal electrode contact is a Schottky contact in nature, implying that the operational principles of PSCs are fundamentally different.33 This is why there is no detailed model to describe the dark J–V characteristics of bulk heterojunction polymer.
 Scheme 2  Equivalent circuit of solar cells based on a p–n junction: V is the applied bias, Jph is the photocurrent, JD the dark current density, Jsh the current density flowing through the shunt resistance Rsh.

Despite the considerations in the preceding paragraph, we found that there is a correlation between the dark J–V characteristics with the Voc enhancement. According to the model of Mihailetchi et al.,34 the dark J–V characteristics of polymer solar cells can be split into three distinct regimes: a leakage current dominated regime at low voltages, a diffusion current dominated regime around the built-in voltage, and a space charge limited current dominated regime at high voltages. As shown in Fig. 2a, for the PFO-DBT35-based devices, in the leakage dominated regime (<0.8V), the dark current density of the devices with a cathode interlayer is 1–2 orders lower than that of the control devices. The Voc increment is calculated to be 0.05–0.10 V using eqn (3) according to the JD data in this regime, which is consistent with the experimental values. However, the absolute calculated Voc values are not available since the Shockley model is not an accurate model for bulk heterojunction devices. It should also be noted that the diffusion current dominated regime is shifted by 150 mV with the CPE layer compared to control devices, which is strong evidence that the built-in voltage of the active layer can indeed be enhanced by CPE materials.16 It is not clear whether the leakage current suppression and the built-in voltage shifting are correlated or independent effects.
In contrast, for the P3HT and MEH-PPV devices, the leakage current difference between the devices with/without interlayer is less than 1 order of magnitude (see Fig. 2b and Fig. 2c, respectively), and the diffusion regime shift was not observed in these devices. The reduced dark current in the PFO-DBT35 devices upon insertion of the interlayer cannot be simply attributed to charge-blocking properties of the interlayer materials since the dark current was kept nearly constant in P3HT and MEH-PPV devices in both types of devices.
Within the metal/insulator(semiconductor)/metal framework,33 the dark J–V characteristics of bulk heterojuntion polymer solar cells can be described by eqn (4), which is based on thermionic emission theory,35 (4)where Js is the reverse dark saturation current density and is given by (5)in which, A* is the Richardson constant, defined as , where m* is the effective mass of an electron, and h is Planck's constant; ϕB is the semiconductor/metal contact barrier height and S is the effective area of the device. Therefore, we would expect that the effective ϕB in the PFO-DBT35 devices was increased upon insertion of the interlayer, resulting in a significant reduction in the reverse dark saturation current density, and thus the dark current density. This is consistent with our previous study in which the effective work function of metal was reduced when the interlayer was incorporated into PLEDs.36 As a result, in reverse bias conditions, the contact barrier for hole injection is increased, implying a higher ϕB at the semiconductor/metal interface. Effective ϕB values can be evaluated from the dark J–V characteristics of the devices, and will be reported in an upcoming manuscript.
The incorporation of an interlayer in the devices can also influence their electrical characteristics. As shown Table 2, the shunt resistance Rsh in the PFO-DBT35 devices increases when an interlayer is included (1–10 kΩ·cm2vs. 0.76 kΩ·cm2). In addition, the rectification ratio (RR) at ±2 V increases significantly (3000–20000 vs. 600), indicating improved diode characteristics. Basically, the electrical characteristics of the PFO-DBT35 devices in Table 2 are consistent with the performance data in Table 1, since good electrical properties of the solar cells, such as a low series resistance Rs and a high shunt resistance, are responsible for the increased FF. In contrast, the improvement in P3HT and MEH-PPV devices is not as pronounced, despite the fact that the RR for the P3HT device can be enhanced from 37000 to 180000–630000. Compared with PFO-DBT35 devices, the control devices based on P3HT and MEH-PPV had a much smaller JD and much bigger RR (600 vs. 37000 and 9000, respectively); this can partially explain why the incorporation of the interlayer in these devices does not cause any difference in Voc.
Table 2 Summary of electrical characteristics in devices employing different CPE materials as the cathode interface layer and that of the control devices. The thickness of the interlayer was fixed at 5 nm for most of the devices. The shunt resistance (Rsh) and series resistance (Rs) were deduced from J–V characteristics at 1 sun, AM 1.5G illumination, while the and rectification ratio (RR, defined as the ratio of the forward-to-reverse bias current density at a bias voltage of ±2 V) was obtained from dark J–V characteristics

Conclusions
We applied five distinct conjugated polymers or polyelectrolytes as cathode interlayers to increase the Voc of polymer solar cells based on polyfluorene copolymers. It was found that Voc enhancement for the polyfluorene copolymer-based solar cells is not sensitive to the interlayer materials, and that the enhancement can be as high as 150 mV. In contrast, while for typical P3HT and MEH-PPV devices, no significant enhancement in Voc was found. Correspondence of the reduced dark current to the Voc enhancement leads to deeper understanding in specific materials systems, opening up new opportunities to enhance the performance of polymer solar cells.
