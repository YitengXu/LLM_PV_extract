    , Accepted 18th May 2017First published on 22nd May 2017AbstractHerein we have investigated the photovoltaic properties of ferrocenyl tetracyanobutadiene derivatives of diketopyrrolopyrroles SM1 and SM2 as efficient non-fullerene acceptors along with a donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymer P as a donor for polymer solar cells. The solar cell devices showed a maximum power conversion efficiency of 6.44% and 6.89% for the vacuum dried P:SM1 and P:SM2 active layers respectively. The solar cells based on SM2 showed higher PCE compared to SM1 which may be due to the larger values of both Jsc and FF. The results presented here demonstrate that employing ferrocene as a donor unit can provide great scope for the molecular design of highly efficient non-fullerene acceptors and provides important progress in the development of non-fullerene organic solar cells.
Introduction
Research on organic solar cells (OSCs) based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layers consisting of a blend of a donor (polymer or small molecule) and an acceptor has resulted in achieving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 10%.1 In the design of efficient OSCs, both the donor and acceptor play a crucial role. At present fullerene derivatives (PC61BM or PC71BM) are widely used as highly efficient acceptors in BHJ active layers, due to their strong electron withdrawing ability, high electron mobility, high electron affinity, isotropic charge transport and appropriate nanoscale morphology with donor materials for exciton dissociation and photo-induced charge transfer.2 Despite these excellent properties, their choice as an acceptor is limited due to the lack of energy level's tunability, weak absorption in the visible region, high cost of synthesis and poor photo-stability. Therefore, there is a strong need to develop non-fullerene acceptors with broad absorption in the longer wavelength region and appropriate energy levels with a simple synthetic methodology at low cost.3 The PCE of small molecule non-fullerene acceptor based OSCs has been dramatically improved in recent times from less than 3% to more than 11% (ref. 4 and 5) owing to the efforts of designing of new acceptors with optimization in film forming processes and interface engineering.
The non-fullerene acceptors should have broad and strong absorption, appropriate frontier molecular orbitals, good solubility and high electron mobility. In order to achieve these properties, conjugated push–pull structures are generally used to design the non-fullerene acceptors, which could reduce the optical bandgap, extend absorption and tune the energy levels. Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) based organic semiconducting materials have been used as promising donors for OSCs due to their several attractive features like good photochemical stability, strong light absorption and facile synthetic modification.6 The DPP based materials exhibit a strong electron withdrawing nature and show high electron mobility (>1 cm2 V−1 s−1); therefore DPP-based materials have been recently used as acceptors for OSCs.7–9
A variety of non-fullerene acceptors have been reported with improved device efficiency. The dicyano (–CN) acceptors have been extensively employed in optoelectronic devices10 which offer an alternative for electron acceptors. The –CN substituent can increase the electron affinity and promote the formation of a crystalline architecture by secondary interaction and/or local dipole alignments that favour efficient charge transport. Recently, Park et al. have reported a dicyanodistyrylbenzene-based acceptor along with P3HT as the electron donor for solution-processed BHJ solar cells and achieved a moderate efficiency of 2.71%.11 The 1,1,4,4-tetracyanobuta-1,3-diene (TCBD) unit exhibits a strong electron withdrawing character and imparts good solubility in organic solvents due to nonplanarity of the molecule which leads to efficient solubility and prevents the formation of aggregates. Recently we have designed triphenylamine and N-phenyl carbazole based TCBD derivatives of DPP and employed them as acceptors along with a D–A copolymer as a donor for the BHJ polymer solar cells and achieved a PCE up to 7.19%.12 Ferrocene is a widely used electron donor, for various applications. Ferrocene exhibits a reversible redox active center,9,13 its derivatives are photochemically as well as thermally stable and show a strong nonlinear optical (NLO) response.10,14 The ferrocenyl derivatives are well known for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) but are rarely known for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell applications.15 To the best of our knowledge for the first time we are reporting ferrocenyl based small molecules as a non-fullerene acceptor for BHJ OSCs.
Herein we have used two small molecules with asymmetrical D–A–D′–A′–D′ (SM1) and symmetrical D–A–D′–A′–D′–A–D (SM2) type DPP systems in which the ferrocene and thiophene moieties act as donors and the DPP and TCBD acceptors as non-fullerene acceptors along with the D–A copolymer P as a donor17 for the fabrication of bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells. After the optimization of the donor to acceptor weight ratio and concentration of the solvent additive, the thermally annealed P:SM1 and P:SM2 based PSCs showed an overall PCE of 5.36% and 5.74%, respectively and further improved up to 6.44% and 6.89%, respectively, when the optimized active layers were vacuum dried.
Results and discussion
Synthesis, optical, thermal and electrochemical properties
We have recently reported the synthesis of SM1 and SM2 (ref. 16) (Scheme S1†) and the chemical structures of these small molecules are shown in Fig. 1. Both SM1 and SM2 have good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, toluene, tetrahydrofuran and dichloromethane. In this work we have studied photovoltaic (OPV) properties of SM1 and SM2.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of SM1, SM2 and P. 
The optical absorption spectra of SM1 and SM2 in dilute THF solution and a thin film cast from the THF solvent are shown in Fig. 2. The absorption spectra exhibit broad bands which cover the entire UV/visible/NIR region of the solar spectrum. To assign the absorption bands we performed time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculation at the B3LYP/6-31+G** for C, H, N, B and Lanl2DZ for the Fe level of theory. The FMOs are shown in Fig. S3† and the important electronic transitions in SM1 and SM2 from TDDFT calculation with composition and oscillator strength are shown in Table S1.† The absorption bands observed in the longer wavelength region (beyond 500 nm) are related to the π–π* transitions of DPP and TCBD units (see Table S1 and Fig. S3†). The major electronic transitions from time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) for SM1 and SM2 are shown in Table S1.† The absorption bands of symmetrical SM2 are red shifted relative to that of asymmetrical SM1. The incorporation of additional ferrocenyl (D) and TCBD (A) units into SM2, resulted in a redshift of 51 nm with decrease in the HOMO–LUMO gap. The thin film absorption spectra of SM1 and SM2 are broader and red-shifted compared to absorption spectra in solution indicating effective aggregation in the solid state due to strong intermolecular π–π interactions derived from their highly conjugated backbone. A shoulder peak observed at 742 nm in SM1 and 806 nm in SM2 arises from extended π–π interactions in the solid state. The optical band gap of SM1 and SM2 was estimated from the onset edge of absorption spectra in the thin film and are 1.49 eV and 1.42 eV, respectively.

The thermal properties of SM1 and SM2 were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere. SM1 and SM2 exhibit good thermal stability and the decomposition temperatures for 5% weight loss were found to be 250 °C and 288 °C respectively (Fig. S1†). The electrochemical properties of both SM1 and SM2 were estimated from cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) techniques (Fig. S2†). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials observed in the cyclic voltammograms. The estimated HOMO/LUMO energy levels of SM1 and SM2 are −5.43/−3.92 and −5.39/−4.02, respectively. The energy differences (ΔEHOMO and ΔELUMO) between the donor and acceptor should be larger than the binding energy of excitons for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer. The HOMO energy level of SM2 is shifted by only 0.04 eV, compared to SM1 while the LUMO energy level is deeper by 0.10 eV. The absorption spectra and electrochemical measurements clearly demonstrate that introduction of an additional D–A significantly reduces the bandgap. Moreover, the LUMO offset between SM1/SM2 and the donor P (−3.62 eV)17 is larger (as shown in the energy level in Fig. 3) than the exciton binding energy (∼0.3 eV) which is sufficient to provide the driving force for exciton dissociation.18

The absorption spectra of P:SM1 and P:SM2 thin films are shown in Fig. 4. The P:SM1 and P:SM2 blended films show strong absorption in the range of 350–820 nm and 350–870 nm, respectively, contributed by both P and SM1 or SM2 in the active layers. The lower bandgap of SM2 compared to SM1 is expected to improve light harvesting for P:SM2 thin films compared to P:SM1. The absorption efficiency (ηA) of both the active layer films with the same thickness was determined by the following expression19  where S(λ) is the photon flux, i.e. the number of photons at wavelength λ in the AM1.5 G solar spectrum, α is the absorption coefficient and d is the thickness of the active layer. The values of ηA are estimated to be 36.45% and 40.23% for P:SM1 and P:SM2, respectively, when the integration has been carried out from 350–900 nm. Therefore, the number of photogenerated excitons may be higher for P:SM2 compared to P:SM1, attributed to the large overlap between the solar spectrum and the P:SM2 active layer.

The large energy difference between the LUMO of SM1 (−3.92 eV) or SM2 (−4.02 eV) acceptor and the HOMO of the P donor (−5.14 eV)17 is beneficial for high Voc of the non-fullerene PSCs. To investigate whether the exciton dissociation and charge transfer can effectively occur in the blended active layers of PSCs or not, we have investigated the photoluminescence (PL) quenching behaviour of the blended films. The PL spectra of pure P and blended with the SM1 or the SM2 film were measured and the results are shown in Fig. 5. The pure P film exhibits a PL emission band in the range of 700–880 nm with a peak at 786 nm. Compared with the pure film, the blended film exhibits a significant PL quenching, indicating that efficient photoinduced charge transfer occurs in the active layers between the donor and acceptor molecules, which is needed for achieving high photovoltaic performance.20 The low value of PL quenching for P:SM1 (86%) relative to P:SM2 (91%) may be related to the low value of driving force charge transfer (ΔGCT) for the former (0.3 eV) than that for the latter (0.4 eV). Stronger PL quenching for P:SM2 suggests more efficient charge transfer from P to SM2 and vice versa, which is beneficial for enhancement in Jsc and FF of the resulting PSC.

Photovoltaic properties
We have selected a conjugated D–A copolymer P consisting of weak donor fused thiophene-imidazole and benzothiadiazole acceptors (chemical structures are shown in Fig. 1) with HOMO/LUMO energy levels of −5.22/−3.62 eV with an optical bandgap of 1.61 eV and used it as an electron donor for the fabrication of solution processed BHJ PSCs. The absorption profile of P is complementary17 to both SM1 and SM2, which is beneficial for the light harvesting ability of the active layer employed in PSCs. The PSCs were fabricated using a conventional structure ITO (indium tin oxide)/PEDOT:PSS(poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrene-sulfonate))/P:SM1 or SM2/PFN/Al. Poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) was used as a cathode buffer layer in OSCs. We have varied the donor to acceptor weight ratio with THF as a solvent and found that an optimized ratio of 1:2 resulted in the best performance for solar cells (results are summarized in Table S2, ESI†) for both SM1 and SM2. It was observed that the photovoltaic parameters (particularly Jsc and FF, and Voc remain almost constant) are influenced by the weight ratio between the donor and the acceptor. When the acceptor content is low, the electron transporting ability will be limited, whereas when the acceptor content is too high, the absorption and hole transporting ability in the active layer will be decreased. The OSCs fabricated with the 1:2 weight ratio showed the best photovoltaic response with an overall PCE of 2.41% and 2.66% for P:SM1 and P:SM2, respectively. In order to improve the PCE of the PSCs, we have employed a solvent additive treatment (3 v% DIO) for optimizing the weight ratio and found that 3 v% gives the best photovoltaic response (Table S2, ESI†). After employing the DIO additives for the preparation of active layers, the OSCs showed an overall PCE of 4.23% and 4.88%, for P:SM1 and P:SM2, respectively.
The optimized active layers (1:2 weight ratio, 3 v% DIO) were (i) either transferred to a vacuum oven immediately for slow vacuum drying at room temperature for 2 hours or (ii) thermally annealed at 110 °C for 2 min (as described in the Experimental section). The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSCs processed using vacuum dried and thermally annealed BHJ active layers are shown in Fig. 6a and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The PSC made from thermally annealed P:SM1 and P:SM2 showed a maximum PCE of 5.36% (Jsc = 10.52 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.98 V and FF = 0.52) and 5.74% (Jsc = 11.86 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.88 V and FF = 0.55), respectively. However, the PCE has been improved when the active layer was vacuum dried. Under the optimized conditions, the maximum PCE obtained for the vacuum dried P:SM1 and P:SM2 active layers was 6.44% (Jsc = 11.34 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.98 V and FF = 0.55) and 6.89% (Jsc = 12.66 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.88 V and FF = 0.62), respectively. All the solar cells based on SM2 showed higher PCEs compared to those based on SM1 which may be attributed to the larger values of both Jsc and FF. The higher value of Jsc may be related to the broader absorption profile of P:SM2 than P:SM1, and the stronger driving force for exciton dissociation (the LUMO offset is larger for P:SM1 than P:SM2). However, the Voc of P:SM1 is higher than that of P:SM2, which may be due to different values of the LUMO of acceptors, i.e.SM1 (−3.92 eV) and SM2 (−4.02 eV), since the Voc is directly related to the difference in the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor.

It can be seen from Tables S2† and 1 that the OSCs based on the SM2 acceptor showed higher PCE than their SM1 based counterparts under all processing conditions. The charge transport in the active layer depends upon the molecular ordering of the materials (donor or acceptor) employed in the active layer. Since we have used the same donor (conjugated polymer) and different acceptors, the difference in the photovoltaic response may be due to the different acceptors. The molecular ordering and crystallinity of the SM1 and SM2 thin films were investigated by X-ray diffraction analysis and are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Both SM1 and SM2 showed crystalline properties with diffraction peaks at a low angle (2θ = 5.63° and 5.95° for SM1 and SM2, respectively) and a higher angle (2θ = 22.37° and 23.07° for SM1 and SM2, respectively) which are related to lamellar spacing and π–π stacking, respectively. The lamellar distance and π–π stacking distance were estimated from the XRD patterns to be 2.56 nm and 2.49 nm and 0.38 and 0.32 nm, for SM1 and SM2, respectively. It can be seen from XRD patterns that the intensity of the peak related to the (100) plane is more and the smaller value of spacing for SM2 than that for SM1 indicates better stacking properties, and thus exhibits higher electron mobility (0.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.12 × 10−4 for DIO/THF processed P:SM1 and P:SM2 active layers, respectively). The higher crystalline nature and electron mobility of SM2 may be attributed to the increased value of Jsc and FF for the device based on SM2.
The trend in the PCE of PSCs processed under different conditions, i.e. only for a vacuum dried or a thermally annealed active layer, are similar for both P:SM1 and P:SM2 (as shown in Table 1); therefore, we have discussed this difference only for P:SM2 based devices. As can be seen from Table 1 both Jsc and FF were higher for the devices processed from vacuum dried active layer than those of their thermally annealed counterparts, whereas Voc is almost the same under both conditions. This may be probably due to favourable phase separation and the nanoscale morphology of the vacuum dried active layer, which facilitate charge transport across the active layer and improved charge collection.
The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the PSCs fabricated from thermally annealed and vacuum dried active layers were recorded and are shown in Fig. 6b. The IPCE spectra of the devices closely resemble the absorption spectra of the active layers, indicating that both the donor and acceptor components in the active layer contribute to the photocurrent generation. The PSC prepared from the vacuum dried P:SM2 film showed higher values of IPCE in the entire wavelength region than those of its thermally annealed counterpart. The higher values of IPCE for the vacuum dried active layer clearly indicate an efficient photon to current conversion process, which has been reflected from the high value of Jsc. The Jsc values were estimated from the integration of the IPCE spectra over a wavelength range (350–900 nm) coupled with the AM1.5 G solar spectrum using the following expression  where q is the elementary electric charge and S(λ) is the photon flux intensity. The theoretical values of Jsc are 11.72 mA cm−2 and 12.52 mA cm−2 for PSCs based on thermally annealed and vacuum dried active layers, respectively and match with the values observed in J–V characteristics under illumination.
The series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) were estimated from the reciprocal of the slope of the J–V characteristics under illumination around Jsc and Voc, respectively and are compiled in Table 1. The decrease in the Rs from 18.45 to 10.6 Ω cm2 and increase in Rsh from 674 to 795 Ω cm2 in thermally annealed and vacuum dried devices, respectively indicates efficient charge transport in vacuum dried BHJ films due to the decrease in the trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination. Fig. 7a shows the variation of Voc with illumination intensity (Pin). The slope of the Vocversus Pin provides information on the degree of trap assisted and SRH recombination in the solar cell prepared from a BHJ active layer.21 It is reported that Voc strongly depends on illumination intensity with a slope of about 2kT/q, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature, when there is trap-assisted recombination.22 In the case of a thermally annealed active layer based PSC a slope of 1.56kT/q was obtained, indicating strong SRH recombination, whereas a PSC based on a vacuum dried active layer exhibits a smaller slope of 1.42kT/q. This is in good agreement with the low value of Rs (see Table 1) observed from the J–V characteristics of devices under illumination which may be due to the improved charge transport due to the favourable morphology and phase separation in the BHJ active layer as a result of the vacuum drying process.
 Fig. 7  Variation of (a) open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current (Jsc) with illumination intensity for the devices based on thermally annealed (TA) and vacuum dried (VD) P:SM2 active layers. 
The variation of Jsc with Pin was examined to get information about the non-geminate bimolecular recombination losses in the PSCs and is shown in Fig. 7b. Generally, the relationship between Jsc and Pin can be described as Jsc∝Pinγ where γ is the recombination parameter and should be equal to unity for minimum recombination and all the free charge carriers after the exciton dissociations are collected at the anode and the cathode without recombination. However, γ < 1 indicates the presence of some amount of bimolecular recombination.23 It can be seen from Fig. 6b that both the PSCs showed linear dependence of Jsc with Pin on a log–log scale with a slope of 0.92 and 0.96 for thermally annealed and vacuum dried active layers, respectively. This indicates that the latter device can sweep out charge carriers more efficiently with negligible bimolecular recombination compared to the former.
In OSCs, there are three processes in charge generation and collection: charge transfer, charge transport and charge extraction. As mentioned above, the PCE of PSCs based on vacuum dried active layers is superior (particularly higher values of Jsc and FF) to those of their thermally annealed active layer counterparts. We have investigated the difference in charge carrier dynamics of the devices, and the charge generation and extraction processes. Fig. 8 shows the variation of photocurrent density (Jph) with the effective voltage (Veff) for the devices. Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff = Vo − Vapp, where Vo is the voltage when Jph is zero and Vapp is the applied voltage. Veff is determined by the internal electric field in the BHJ active layer, influencing the charge carrier transport and their extraction. It can be seen from Fig. 8 that Jph linearly increases with increasing voltage in a low Veff region and then saturates at a sufficiently high Veff. The saturated photocurrent (Jphsat) was observed at Veff = 1.5–2.5 V. Exciton generation rates and charge collection efficiencies (Pc = Jsc/Jphsat) were determined to be about 0.91 and 0.95 for PSCs based on thermally annealed and vacuum dried active layers, respectively. The higher value of Pc for a vacuum dried blend than a thermally annealed blend is consistent with the superior values of Jsc and FF. The dependence of Jsc and Voc with illumination intensity and values of Pc suggest that bimolecular recombination and the space charge effect were relatively more suppressed for the device based on a vacuum dried active layer than its thermally annealed counterpart.

In order to get information about the charge transport within the active layer of PSCs processed under different conditions, we have fabricated hole and electron only devices from these active layers with an appropriate choice of electrodes. The configuration of hole only and electron only devices was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and ITO/Al/active layer/Al, respectively and the J–V characteristics of the device in the dark were measured. The J–V characteristics of the hole and electron only devices (based on thermally annealed and vacuum dried P:SM2) are shown in Fig. 9. The electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) of the active layers were estimated using the Mott–Gurney space charge limited current model24  where εo is the permittivity of free space, εr is the dielectric constant of the active layer and is taken as 3.0, μ is the corresponding charge carrier mobility, V is the applied voltage and d is the thickness of the active layer. The μh of the donor P is about 1.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the thermally annealed active layer, which slightly increased after vacuum drying to 1.32 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. However, the μe increased significantly from 1.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for thermally annealed to 2.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the vacuum dried counterpart. The increase in electron mobility may be related to an improved FF (from 0.55 to 0.62). Similarly the values of μe for thermally annealed and vacuum dried P:SM1 are about 1.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.

In order to get information about the change in the morphology we have carried out transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements of the active layer (P:SM1 and P:SM2) processed with either a thermally annealed or vacuum dried active layer as shown in Fig. 10. As can be seen from this figure the thermally annealed film is rather smooth and exhibits comparatively poor interpenetrating phase separation between donor and acceptor phases. However the VD processed active layer exhibits a more appropriate degree of phase separation compared to the TA processed active layer which contributes to high exciton dissociation and charge transport leading to higher Jsc and FF.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have studied solar cell properties of two small molecules with asymmetrical D–A–D′–A′–D′ (SM1) and symmetrical D–A–D′–A′–D′–A–D (SM2) structures as acceptors along with a D–A copolymer P as a donor. The solar cells made using thermal treatment showed PCEs of 5.36% and 5.74% for P:SM1 and P:SM2 respectively. The maximum PCEs of 6.44% and 6.89% were obtained for the vacuum dried P:SM1 and P:SM2 active layers respectively. The solar cells processed under different conditions based on SM2 showed higher PCEs compared to SM1 which may be due to the larger values of both Jsc and FF. The enhanced values of Jsc and FF for SM2 based devices than their SM1 counterparts may be due to the higher values of hole mobility, better charge transport, lower lamellar and π–π stacking distance and the nano-scale morphology of the active layer and increased photon absorption for the former than the latter, as evidenced by the TEM images and absorption spectra of the active layers. The results presented here demonstrate that employing ferrocene as a donor unit can provide great opportunities for the molecular design of highly efficient non-fullerene acceptors and provides an important milestone in the development of non-fullerene organic solar cells.
