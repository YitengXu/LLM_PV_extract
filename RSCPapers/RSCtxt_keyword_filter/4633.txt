    , Accepted 8th June 2020First published on 9th June 2020AbstractA series of porphyrin dyes with D–A′–π–A structure were designed and theoretically investigated by DFT and TD-DFT methods. Different electron-withdrawing auxiliary acceptor units were introduced into the dye molecule skeleton to shed light on how the type and position of auxiliary acceptors influence the photoelectric performance of the dyes. It was found that the introduction of electron-withdrawing units, BTD, TPZ, BTZ, PP and DPPZ, between the Zn-porphyrin core and the anchoring group had a significantly positive influence on the performance of the dye molecules. Also, more appropriate electron distribution in the molecular orbital and the lower HOMO–LUMO energy gap, more extensive absorption coverage, higher light-harvesting efficiency, lower orbital overlap, and more effective long-range intramolecular electron transfer (IET) process can be achieved as compared to the reference dye. Among these five electron-withdrawing units, BTD and TPZ had the effect leading to the greatest improvement and therefore, are the best candidates for auxiliary acceptors. The calculated results indicated that the longitudinal π-conjugation of the electron-withdrawing unit also had an obvious effect on the performance of the dye molecule, and NTD is expected to be a more effective auxiliary acceptor than BTD. The effects of the relative positions of the auxiliary acceptors in the dye molecular skeleton were also investigated. A comparative study of AX1–3 and AA1–3 showed that the introduction of BTD, TPZ and BTZ units between the donor part and the Zn-porphyrin core may have a negative impact on the performance of the dyes. Our studies are expected to provide new insight for the design and screening of high-efficiency porphyrin dyes for DSSCs applications.
1 Introduction
With the increasing demand for energy and the ongoing deterioration of the environment, clean and renewable solar energy has attracted more and more attention in recent years. As a promising photoelectric conversion device, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), with the superiorities of low production cost, simple fabrication, and relatively high power conversion efficiency (PCE), have been extensively investigated since they were reported in 1991 by Grätzel and O’Regan.1 In DSSCs, sensitizers play a crucial role in photoelectric conversion processes due to their functions such as light-harvesting, electron excitation and transfer. In recent years, metal–organic complexes and metal-free organic dye sensitizers have been widely developed and studied in the DSSCs field, and metal-free organic dyes have been considered to be promising candidates for DSSCs due to their low cost, high molar extinction coefficient, and environmental compatibility.2–7 Among these metal-free sensitizers, porphyrins and their derivatives, with the advantages of suitable structure, intense Soret and Q bands and extremely broad absorption range, have been extensively studied and have achieved impressive photovoltaic performances.8–16
In recent years, an effective D–π–A configuration with an electron donor group (D), a conjugated bridge (π) and an electron acceptor (A) was usually adopted to design organic dyes, which would be beneficial to induce effective intramolecular electron transfer (IET) processes and result in high molar extinction coefficients as well as high PCE over 10%.17–23 The overall properties of D–π–A-based dyes can be readily tuned by varying the electron donor, π-conjugated bridge, or acceptor units, thus endowing D–π–A-based dyes with flexible photoelectric properties. Based on the D–π–A configuration, another effective molecular engineering strategy of the D–A′–π–A (A′ is an auxiliary acceptor) configuration was proposed, namely, attaching an auxiliary acceptor to the D–π–A framework. The incorporated auxiliary acceptor can modulate the energy gap and enhance the ICT process,24,25 resulting in not only the extension of the light-harvesting wavelength but also an improvement in the photovoltaic performance and photo-stability.23,24 In 2011, Tian and Zhu et al. designed novel organic dyes featuring the D–A′–π–A structure by introducing an electron-deficient group as the auxiliary acceptor, resulting in an obviously extended spectral response.26 Encouraged by their work, some D–A′–π–A-type organic dyes containing different auxiliary acceptors, such as benzothiadiazole,25,27–29 benzotriazole,30 pyrido[3,4-b]pyrazine,31 isoindigo,32,33 quinoxaline,34,35 thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine,36 and so on, were reported. Great successes were achieved on extending the absorption spectrum, tuning the HOMO–LUMO energy gap, and improving the stability of the excited-state, and thus significantly enhancing the overall photoelectric performances of DSSCs devices. In the same way, some auxiliary acceptors were also introduced in the porphyrin molecule skeleton to construct the D–A′–π–A-type porphyrin dyes: the electron-withdrawing group benzothiadiazole (BTD) integrated into SM315,37 XW11,8 LP-12,12 SGT-020,15 and SGT-025;16 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline (DPQ) used in LP-11,12 and PNE59;38 pyridothiadiazole (PTD) in SGT-023.16 Previous efforts have explored the improvement of the photovoltaic performance of porphyrin-based DSSCs and some meaningful conclusions about the introduction of auxiliary acceptor have been obtained, such as the electron-withdrawing group in the porphyrin-based dye skeleton modulating the LUMO level of the dye and improving light-harvesting properties.23 However, studies on the inherent mechanism of the influence of introducing electron-withdrawing units on the photoelectric performance of dyes are still insufficiently comprehensive and clear, and the structure–performance relationship between the position, as well as the type of electron-withdrawing auxiliary acceptor, and the electronic structure and light absorption properties of dye molecules has not yet been established.
In this work, to evaluate the effect of auxiliary acceptors on the performance of porphyrin dyes, a series of D–A′–π–A dyes have been designed based on the CM-b dye.11 The intrinsic properties of the designed dyes were theoretically elucidated by the density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) methods, including molecular geometry, frontier molecular orbital electronic structure, absorption spectra, light-harvesting efficiency (LHE), and photo-induced electron transfer properties. This work aims to shed light on how the type and the position of the auxiliary acceptor influence the photoelectric performance of the dyes, and the related conclusions will provide valuable insight for the design and screening of novel high-performance porphyrin dyes for DSSCs.
2 Computational methods
2.1 Computational detail
In this work, all the DFT/TD-DFT calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 program package.39 The ground-state geometries of all the studied porphyrin dyes were optimized by the B3LYP exchange–correlation functional in conjunction with the 6-31G(d) basis set in THF solution. To confirm the optimized geometries, vibrational analyses were performed at the same level. The results show that all the optimized structures correspond to a minimum potential energy surface with no imaginary frequency. The electronic absorption spectra, emission energy and excitation properties (the 30 lowest singlet–singlet excitations) of the studied dyes were calculated by TD-DFT method based on the optimized ground-state structures in THF solution. The solvent effects of THF were modeled with a conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM).40 The obtained TD-DFT results were further submitted to Multiwfn41 to obtain the absorption spectra. The electron density differences were also calculated with the Multiwfn 3.3.8 code by comparing the charge density in the ground state and the excited state of the dyes. Furthermore, electron-transfer parameters, including the distance of electron transfer (DCT), transferred charge (qCT), H, and t index were calculated with Multiwfn.41
2.2 Calculation method calibrations
For the calculation results to be close to the experimental results, calculation method calibrations were performed to find a suitable level for the excited state description of the studied porphyrin dyes. We adopted three functionals of the standard hybrid functional B3LYP, long-range corrected functional CAM-B3LYP, and the meta-hybrid xc-functional M06 (27% of exact exchange) in calculating the absorption spectrum of the porphyrin dye CM-b11 in THF solution; the results were then compared with the experimental data, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Our results showed that the absorption spectrum obtained with the CAM-B3LYP functional produced a hypsochromatic shift throughout the spectral range, whose absorption peaks were located at 391.0/397.9/421.5/583.1 nm for CM-b; these values are smaller than the experimental values of 448/631 nm. With regard to the B3LYP and M06, the calculated absorption peaks were detected at 420.2/434.6/578.1/680.4 nm and at 428.9/438.4/633.8 nm, respectively. Obviously, the spectral data obtained with M06 matched considerably better with the experimental values as compared to those obtained with other functionals. The results are in good agreement with the calibrations in our previous work.42 As a consequence, all the TD-DFT calculations were performed at the M06/6-31 G(d) level unless otherwise stated.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Molecular geometry
In 2016, a porphyrin dye CM-b was reported, which exhibited strong light-harvesting ability as evidenced by a perfectly large Qx molar absorptivity.11 CM-b was constructed with N-substituted indoline as the donor, a Zn-porphyrin core and a benzene ring as the π-bridge. In this study, a series of D–A′–π–A porphyrin dyes were designed by attaching five different auxiliary acceptor units to the CM-b molecular structure. First, considering the better spectral and electron injection properties of the dyes with the cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group,43 we substituted carboxylic acid with cyanoacrylic acid as the anchoring group to construct the designed porphyrin dyes. Second, five electron-withdrawing units, benzothiadiazole (BTD), thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (TPZ), benzotriazole (BTZ), 2,3-diphenylpyrido[3,4-b]pyrazine (PP), and dipyrido[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine (DPPZ) were inserted between the π-bridge and the anchoring group as auxiliary acceptors to construct dyes AA1–5, respectively. Another benzene ring was introduced between the π-bridge and the anchoring group but no auxiliary acceptor was used; this served as the reference dye REF. To explore the effect of the position of the auxiliary acceptor on the performance of the dye, the BTD, TPZ and BTZ groups were placed between the donor and the porphyrin core to construct dyes AX1-3. Furthermore, naphtho[2,3-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (NTD)44 and thieno[3,4-b]quinoxaline (TQX)45 were introduced in dyes AY1–2 to evaluate the effect of longitudinal π-conjugation on the performance of the dyes. To balance the accuracy and computational efficiency, the long alkoxy chains of hexyloxy and octyloxy in the porphyrin core were replaced by the methoxy group, which were previously proven to have little impact on the optical properties.42 The geometric structures of all the investigated porphyrin dyes are depicted in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of the investigated porphyrin dyes. 
The structure optimizations of the studied porphyrin dyes in THF were performed using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) method and the optimized geometries of the studied porphyrin dyes are shown in Table S1 (ESI†); the selected geometrical parameters, bond lengths and dihedral angles are listed in Table 1. The markers for the dihedral angles and chemical bonds are illustrated in Fig. 1. As shown in Table 1, all the studied porphyrin dyes exhibited better coplanarity between the porphyrin unit and auxiliary acceptor, with dihedral angles Φ1 and Φ2 equal to about 180°. Furthermore, compared with other porphyrin dyes, AA2 and AY2 exhibited beneficial molecular planarity, with dihedral angles Φ3 equal to 177.29° (AA2) and 178.39° (AY2), respectively. The values of d1–d3 of all the studied porphyrin dyes were in the range of 1.385–1.481 Å, which are shorter than the C–C single bond. These calculated results indicate a strong conjugation effect between the donor and acceptor, which will be helpful for efficient ICT from the donor to the cyanoacetic acid acceptor. More importantly, d1 (1.412 Å), d2 (1.389 Å) and d3 (1.452) of AA2, as well as d1 (1.409 Å), d2 (1.385 Å) and d3 (1.447) of AY2 were obviously shorter than those of other porphyrin dyes. The results suggest that the electron-withdrawing auxiliary acceptors TPZ and TQX inserted between the π-bridge and the anchoring group can generate a more efficient conjugation effect. The related structure-performance relationship will be further discussed in the following segments.

3.2 Molecular orbital and electronic structure
In order to facilitate the discussion of the molecular orbital and electronic structure-related structure–property relationship between the dye and the auxiliary acceptor, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level to investigate the electron-withdrawing abilities of the auxiliary acceptor units BTD, TPZ, BTZ, PP, DPPZ, NTD, and TQX. The related results of theoretical calculations are presented in Fig. S2 and Table S2 (ESI†). As presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the LUMO levels of NTD and TQX were more down-shifted compared to those of other units (BTD, TPZ, BTZ, PP, and DPPZ), indicating that the electron-withdrawing capacities of NTD and TQX were stronger than other units (BTD, TPZ, BTZ, PP, and DPPZ). Based on the order of the acceptor ability for the present acceptor units BTD, TPZ, BTZ, PP, DPPZ, NTD, and TQX, a detailed discussion about the structure–property relationship between the dye and the auxiliary acceptor is reasonable.
It is well known that to gain effective charge separation state and electron injection from the dye to the conduction band of the semiconductor, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) should mainly localize on the donor while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) should be on the acceptor.46–48 In DSSCs, electron excitation from the HOMOs to the LUMOs determines the intramolecular electron transfer (IET), and electron transfer from the dye to the conduction band determines the interfacial electron injection properties.49 To show a clear picture of electron excitation, the frontier molecular orbitals from HOMO−2 to LUMO+1 of the selected porphyrin dyes are plotted in Fig. 2, and others are provided in Fig. S3 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S3 (ESI†), for dyes AA1–5, and AY1–2 with the auxiliary acceptor between the Zn-porphyrin core and the anchoring group, the HOMO and HOMO−1 were mainly localized on the indoline-based donor and Zn-porphyrin core, while the HOMO−2 was only localized on the Zn-porphyrin core. It is clear that different auxiliary acceptors have a slight impact on the HOMOs. Concerning AX1–3, in which the electron-deficient units of BTD, TPZ, and BTZ were placed between the donor and Zn-porphyrin core, HOMO−2 exhibited a similar distribution to that of AA1–5 and AY1–2, and the HOMO almost completely lies on the donor. However, the distribution of HOMO−1 in AX1–3 tends to involve the bridge and acceptor group, which is unfavorable for the formation of efficient charge-separated states. More analyses were performed to determine the impact of the introduction of auxiliary acceptors on the electron contributions in LUMOs. As illustrated in Fig. 2 and Fig. S3 (ESI†), it is clear that the LUMO of all the designed porphyrin dyes, as well as REF, exhibited a similar distribution characteristic, which was localized mainly on the acceptor and auxiliary acceptors linked to the anchor group, and less on the Zn-porphyrin core. This is beneficial for the effective charge separation and electron injection from the dye to the conduction band of the semiconductor. For AA1–5 and AY1–2, the distribution of LUMO+1 is as favorable as that of LUMO. In particular, for AA5, the LUMO+1 is entirely located on the anchor group and auxiliary acceptor, which may be attributed to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of DPPZ. Comparatively, for AX1–3 the LUMO+1 was mainly located on the Zn-porphyrin core and auxiliary acceptor unit rather than the anchor group, manifesting that no efficient charge-separated state was formed in these three dyes, thus resulting in severe electron recombination.
 Fig. 2  The selected frontier molecular orbitals and charge density differences (Δρ) of REF, AA1–3, AX1 and AY1–2 between the ground state and the first excited state, with an isodensity contour of 0.02. 
In order to further investigate the IET characters, the electronic density difference (EDD) plots between the ground and excited states of the designed porphyrin dyes were also calculated and are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S3 (ESI†). It is clear that for AA1–5, AX1–3, and REF, the regions of the electron density depletion (cyan color) were mostly localized at the indoline donor parts, while the regions of the electron density increment (red color) were largely aligned with the conjugated bridge, auxiliary acceptor, and the anchor group. This charge-separated state will be helpful in DSSCs application. For the AY1–2 with auxiliary groups of NTD and TQX, the majority of the increased electron density was located on the electron-deficient auxiliary group, not on the anchor group, which would result in intramolecular electron recombination and low-efficiency electron injection into the semiconductor. Comparatively, a greater increase in electron density was located on the Zn-porphyrin core in AX1–3 as compared to AA1–5 and REF, resulting in the less favorable IET property. As a whole, it is not difficult to conclude that the most effective IET processes take place in AA1–5 porphyrin dyes, and the strong electron-withdrawing capacities of NTD and TQX are not conducive to effective IET and electron injection from dye to semiconductor.
The energy levels of the frontier molecular orbitals from HOMO−2 to LUMO+2 together with the HOMO–LUMO gaps of all the investigated porphyrin dyes are depicted in Fig. 3, and the values of the HOMO and LUMO energies are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3, the HOMO levels of all the studied dyes were all under the oxygen reduction potential of I−/I3− (−4.6 eV),50 which suggests the feasibility of the transfer of electrons from the electrolyte to the oxidized dye to promote the reduction of the dye.51–53 The LUMO levels of all the studied dyes were above the conduction band edge (CBE) of the TiO2 semiconductor (−4.0 eV),54 which indicates that excited dyes have sufficient thermodynamic force to inject electrons into the conduction band of TiO2.51–54 As seen from Fig. 3 and Table S3 (ESI†), the introduction of auxiliary acceptors in the molecule skeleton has a slight effect on the HOMO energy but obviously reduces the LUMO energy. In other words, the LUMO level of the dye molecule can be modulated by introducing different electron-withdrawing auxiliary acceptors. It is clear that the HOMO–LUMO gaps of the designed D–A′–π–A dyes are lower than that of the REF, regardless of the kind of auxiliary acceptors and their positions. The related energy gaps range from 1.44 eV to 2.04 eV, and decrease in the following sequence: REF > AX1 > AA3 > AX3 > AA5 > AX2 > AA4 > AA1 > AA2 > AY1 > AY2. This shows that the introduction of electron-withdrawing auxiliary groups in AA1–5 has a greatly positive effect on the decrease in the energy gap relative to REF (1.67–1.96 eV vs. 2.04 eV). The small decrease in the energy gap for AA3 may be attributed to the weak electron-withdrawing ability of BTZ. The minimum energy gap for AA2 among these five dyes AA1–5 can be ascribed to the relatively strong electron-withdrawing capacity of TPZ, as well as the planarity between the TPZ π-bridge and the donor, with dihedral angles Φ1, Φ2 and Φ3 equal to about 180°. AX1 and AX3 exhibited energy gaps of 1.99 eV and 1.94 eV, indicating that the auxiliary acceptor between the donor unit and the Zn-porphyrin core has a tiny effect on reducing the LUMO energy, which is consistent with the results of the molecular orbital distribution analyses. Due to the strong electron-deficient nature of NTD and TQX, AY1–2 presented the relatively small HOMO–LUMO energy gaps of 1.66 eV and 1.44 eV among all the porphyrin dyes. However, the minimum energy gap of AY2 was unfavorable for forming a steady photo-excited state, thus affecting the efficient electron injection from the dye to the photo-anode in DSSCs.42,55

3.3 Electron excitation and absorption spectra
In DSSCs, the light absorption and the related electron excitations of dye play an important role in the high efficiency of solar cells. A dye with strong light absorption ability is beneficial for improving the PCE of DSSCs. TD-DFT calculations for the studied porphyrin dyes were performed by the TD M06/6-31G(d) level in THF solvent, and the simulated UV/vis absorption spectra for the studied dyes are shown in Fig. 4. The vertical excitation energies, oscillator strengths, and relative orbital contributions of the optical transitions between 350 and 950 nm for the selected dyes AA1, AA2, AA3, AX1, and AY2 together with REF are listed in Table 2. The information for other dyes is given in Table S4 (ESI†). It is known that the absorption bands of the porphyrins are due to the electronic transitions from the ground state S0 to the lowest singlet excited states S1 (Q state) and S2 (B state).56,57 As shown in Fig. 4, all the dyes exhibit the typical porphyrin absorption spectra, involving an intense Soret band with the electron transition from the ground to the second excited state (S0 → S2) and a relatively weak intense Q band in the range of 700–950 nm with the electron transition from the ground to the first excited state (S0 → S1).56,57 Compared with the B band, the Q bands of all designed dyes exhibited the more intricate alterations as compared to that of the REF, including the maximum absorption peak positions and intensities. As listed in Table 2 and Table S4 (ESI†), for dyes AA1–5, the maximum absorption peaks of the Q band were red-shifted towards the infrared region relative to the REF, thus obtaining a broad absorption coverage in the sequence of AA2 (788.4 nm) > AA1 (707.3 nm) > AA4 (694.3 nm) > AA5 (686.6 nm) > AA3 (662.7 nm) > REF (630 nm). This is in good agreement with the sequence of energy gaps for these dyes. The difference between the spectral range and energy gap of AA1–5 may be because of the distinction of the electron-withdrawing capacity of auxiliary acceptors. Otherwise, compared to REF, the Q band maximum molar extinction coefficients of AA1–4 increased, which indicated a stronger π–π* transition character in AA1–4. Among AA1–5, AA1 and AA2 with BTD or TPZ units as auxiliary acceptors close to the anchoring segment exhibited the best performances in both the maximum absorption wavelength and energy gap, while AA3 with BTZ as the auxiliary acceptor showed the worst spectral properties. This could be explained by the relatively weaker electron-accepting ability of the nitrogen atom as compared to the sulfur atom in the auxiliary acceptor unit. The corresponding orbital transitions for the main absorption peaks are given in Table 2 and Table S4 (ESI†). It is clear that the Q band of the REF involves the transition from HOMO → LUMO (64%) and a comparatively ineffective transition from HOMO → LUMO+1 (20%). In comparison, the effective transition of HOMO → LUMO (85%) for AA1 was found at 707.3 nm with f = 1.30, and a more effective transition of HOMO → LUMO (89%) for AA2 at 788.4 nm with f = 1.69 was obtained, which exhibited the characteristics of ligand-to-ligand electron transfer (LLET) by the effective charge-separated states.42 Not surprisingly, AA3 exhibited a relatively worse performance than AA1 in the optical transition, comprised of HOMO → LUMO (78%) and HOMO → LUMO+1 (10%). The results of orbital transitions are consistent with the above results for the absorption spectra. Similar consequences of optical transitions were obtained in B bands. The obtained results indicate that the introduction of auxiliary acceptors between the Zn-porphyrin core and the anchoring group have a positive effect on the optical properties of dyes, which would be mainly reflected in facilitating the electron excitation and charge separation, and the efficient electron injection from the dye into the conduction band of TiO2.

As listed in Table 2 and Table S4 (ESI†), for AX1–3, small changes were found in the maximum absorption wavelengths for AX1 and AX3 as compared to REF in both B and Q bands, except that AX2 exhibited an obviously bathochromic absorption spectrum in the Q band. Concerning optical transitions, both AX1 and AX3 presented ineffective transitions. These were mainly composed of HOMO−1 → LUMO+3 (53%) at 402.2 nm in the B band/HOMO−1 → LUMO (70%) at 625.5 nm in the Q band for AX1, and HOMO−2 → LUMO+2 (59%) at 403.1 nm in the B band/HOMO−1 → LUMO (48%) at 633.6 nm in the Q band for AX3. These ineffective transitions are detrimental for charge separation, thus hampering the photo-to-electron conversion of porphyrin dyes. For AX2, an effective HOMO → LUMO (80%) transition at 685.1 nm in the Q band was detected, but the spectral range and optical transition exhibited no positive improvement as compared to REF. From the above results, it is clear that the introduction of auxiliary acceptors between the donor and the porphyrin core had little, or even adverse effects, on improving the performance of the dyes. As a consequence, the introduction of auxiliary acceptors at the position close to the anchoring segment may be a wiser modification for better properties of the DSSCs.
Next, we discuss the effects of the longitudinal π-conjugation of auxiliary acceptors on the properties of light absorption and the related optical transitions. As shown in Fig. 4(a), compared with AA1, the maximum absorption wavelength of AY1 (with NTD auxiliary acceptor) red-shifted from 707.3 (AA1) to 800.5 nm, leading to a broader light absorption coverage, which is attributed to the better electron-withdrawing ability of NTD as compared to the BTD unit. Besides, AY1 exhibited a more effective optical transition originating from HOMO → LUMO (89%) at 800.5 nm in the Q band. In addition, AY2 exhibited excellent light-harvesting ability with the maximum absorption wavelength at 937.5 nm, and the related optical transition was mainly comprised of HOMO → LUMO (93%). From the above results, it can be concluded that extending the longitudinal conjugation length of the auxiliary acceptors can effectively improve spectral performance by reducing the band gap of the dye sensitizer, which is mainly manifested in broadening the spectral absorption range and optimizing the optical transition. However, the electron-deficient performance of the auxiliary acceptor is not as strong as possible. AY2 with electron-deficient TQX as the auxiliary acceptor exhibited the largest Q band absorption of 937.5 nm, corresponding to the minimum energy gap of 1.32 eV, which is unfavorable for maintaining the stability of the excited-state dye. The instability of the dye will, therefore, intensify the electronic recombination, which will eventually adversely affect the performance of the dye sensitizer.
The S1 excited state optimization calculations of AA1, AA2, AA3, AX1, and AY1 were performed at the M06/6-31 G(d) level to give more photophysical properties about vertical excitation, emission energy and transition dipole moments, etc., and the related data are collected in Table S5 (ESI†). As shown in Table S5 (ESI†), compared with the maximum absorption wavelength, the emission peaks of AA1, AA2, AA3, AX1, and AY1 were all red-shifted by about 110–190 nm, and the related optical transitions showed similar behavior to that of the absorption spectra. In comparison, the effective transition of the LUMO → HOMO (91%) for AA1 was found at 857.4.3 nm with f = 1.925, and a more effective transition of LUMO → HOMO (93.3%) for AA2 at 966.9 nm with f = 2.180 was obtained. As expected, among AA1, AA2, AA3, AX1, and AY1, AX1 exhibited relatively worse performance in the optical transition. In addition, among AA1, AA2, AA3, AX1, and AY1, AA2 exhibited the largest transition dipole moment with a value of 69.39 D, which indicated the best optical transition ability of AA2.
3.4 Light-harvesting efficiency (LHE)
As discussed above, introducing electron-withdrawing auxiliary acceptors, especially for BTD, TPZ, and NTD between the Zn-porphyrin core and the anchoring group, could significantly improve the performance of porphyrin dyes, such as their HOMO–LUMO energy gaps, optical transitions, and absorption spectra. To further explore the influence of auxiliary acceptors on the light-harvesting ability of the designed dyes, the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE(λ)), an important parameter for evaluating the photo-electric conversion efficiency of DSSCs, was investigated. LHE(λ) is the light-harvesting efficiency at a given wavelength, which is determined by the oscillator strength at the maximum absorption wavelength.58 LHE(λ) = 1 − 10−f(1)

Fig. 5 presents the lowest vertical excitation energies (EA), oscillator strengths (f), and the relative LHE (RLHE = LHEdyes/LHEREF) of all the studied porphyrin dyes; the corresponding values are listed in Table S6 (ESI†). Compared with REF, most of the newly designed dyes achieved promotion in the LHE, except for AA5 and AX3, which had tiny decreases by 1% as seen from Table S6 (ESI†). Compared with REF, the oscillator strengths were obviously improved from 1.04 (REF) to 1.30 (AA1), 1.69 (AA2), and 1.39 (AA3), and the related RHLE increased from 1.00 (REF) to 1.045 (AA1), 1.077 (AA2), and 1.055 (AA3), respectively. Particularly, the LHE value of AA2 reached to 97.9%, indicating that among the BTD, TPZ, BTZ, PP, and DPPZ units, the TPZ group would be the most effective auxiliary acceptor for improving the light-harvesting ability of the dye. When the positions of the BTD, TPZ, and BTZ units were changed to close to the donor subunit, the RLHE of AX1–3 showed a relatively smaller value of 1.021 (AX1), 1.002 (AX2), and 0.996 (AX3), as compared with AA1–3. The results further indicated that introducing the auxiliary acceptor between the donor and the Zn-porphyrin core is relatively inappropriate for the light-harvesting ability of the dye. In addition, compared with REF, the light-harvesting performances of AY1–2 were also improved, with the LHE values of 93.8% and 95.7%, respectively, but the RLHE values were not changed by much as compared with that of AA1–2. The results indicated that the prolongation of the longitudinal π-conjugation of the auxiliary acceptor had little effect on the improvement of the light-harvesting performance of dye molecules.

3.5 Intramolecular electron transfer (IET)
In order to quantitatively evaluate the intramolecular charge transfer character, charge transfer parameters, such as DCT, qCT, H, and t, were calculated with Multiwfn and the results are listed in Table 3. DCT is the charge transfer length, qCT is the transferred charge, H is the half of the sum of the centroid axis along the electron transfer direction, and t is the difference between DCT and H. For more details about the above-mentioned parameters, please refer to the literature.59–61 The IET rates (KET) at specific photo-excitation wavelengths (λ) are also listed in Table 3. According to the Marcus theory,62,63 the IET rate KET can be depicted as (2)where ℏ, kB, and T present the Planck constant, Boltzmann constant, and temperature, respectively. λtotal represents the reorganization energy, which reflects the geometry relaxation in the involved donor and acceptor when their electronic state changes. Vab is the electronic coupling constant reflecting the overlap of the wave functions between two charge-localized states. ΔG0 represents the standard Gibbs free energy change. As a self-exchange process, the standard Gibbs free energy change before and after the IET process is considered as zero (ΔG0 = 0).62 The reorganization energy λtotal in IET consists of inner and outer parts, λv and λs, respectively.64,65λv corresponds to the changes in the intramolecular geometries of the donor and acceptor states while λs comes from the solvent response, which is due to the surrounding dielectric medium and is often ignored.65 In the present work, we focus on λv only. λv can be evaluated by Nelson's four-point method:65–67 (3)where  and E0A are the energy of the neutral acceptor (A) at the cationic state and the optimized neutral-state geometries, respectively. E+D and  are the energies of the cationic donor (D+) at the neutral and optimal cation geometries, respectively. In addition, according to the generalized Mulliken–Hush (GMH) method,68 the value of Vab is described as (4)where μab, ΔEab, and Δμab respectively reflect the transition dipole moment, the vertical excitation energy, and the dipole moment difference between the initial and final adiabatic states.69 These values can be obtained from the Gaussian output files. The calculated values of Vab and λv are also listed in Table 3.

Table 3 demonstrates that an intricate effect on the IET performance of dyes was generated by introducing additional electron-deficient units close to the anchoring group in the porphyrin dye skeleton. Compared with REF, dyes AA3–5 exhibit relatively larger qCT values of 1.267 (AA3), 1.002 (AA4), and 0.991 (AA5), which indicate that the introduction of BTZ, PP and DPPZ units has a beneficial effect on the electron charge transfer in these dyes. However, unfortunately, compared with REF, AA1 and AA2 exhibited relatively smaller qCT values of 0.912 (AA1) and 0.766 (AA2), indicating less electron transfer in these two dyes. Considering the difference in the electron-withdrawing abilities of BTD, TPZ, BTZ, PP and DPPZ units, it is not difficult to conclude that introducing a suitable electron-withdrawing unit close to the anchoring group in the porphyrin dye skeleton has a beneficial effect on the intramolecular electron transfer, while the introduction of a strong electron-withdrawing unit may go overboard. DCT is another important parameter for evaluating the charge transfer properties. As shown in Table 3, except for AA3, the DCT values of AA1, AA2, AA4, and AA5 were all reduced from 11.290 (REF) to 10.184, 9.094, 10.198, and 9.759, respectively, which is detrimental to the effective charge separation. This phenomenon can be ascribed to the fact that electrons in the dye will be affected by the electron-withdrawing effects of auxiliary acceptors, thus shortening the electron-transferred distance. In contrast, except for AA3, dyes AA1, AA2, AA4, and AA5 all exhibited lower t factors ranging from 1.505–2.349 Å, as compared to REF (2.556 Å), manifesting a small orbital overlap in these dyes. Moreover, the introduction of electron-withdrawing units in AA1–5 can also accelerate the IET process with increased KET values from 1.97 for REF to 2.67, 2.71, 3.13, 2.04 and 3.22 fs−1, respectively, which resulted from the lower inner reorganization energy (λv) with the values from 0.666 eV (REF) to 0.594–0.663 (AA1–5).
As seen from Table 3, auxiliary acceptors NTD and TQX whose electron-withdrawing capacities are stronger than BTD and TPZ predictably presented more negative effects on the intramolecular electron transfer in dyes AY1–2, with the qCT of 0.789 (AY1), and 0.670 (AY2), together with the DCT of 8.570 (AY1), and 7.590 (AY2). Even worse, the IET rate of AY2 was calculated to be 0.35 fs−1, which is far less than that of the REF (1.97 fs−1). Therefore, it can be concluded that extending the longitudinal π-conjugation of auxiliary acceptors would heighten the negative impact on the quantity and distance of electron-transfer, and weaken the accelerated effect on the IET process. Based on the above analysis results, AY2 is not suitable for practical solar cell applications. However, as shown in Table 3, AY1 still showed a relatively favorable IEF performance. Given the prominent performance of AY1 in other aspects, such as light absorption and optical transition, etc., NTD is still valuable as an auxiliary acceptor in porphyrin dyes.
As shown in Table 3, the negative effect on IET processes seems not to be significantly exhibited in AX1–3 as a whole. The IET rates of AX1–3 were calculated to be 3.24, 3.61, and 2.93 fs−1, respectively. Nevertheless, in view of the above analysis results for light absorption and optical transitions, etc., the introduction of additional acceptors close to the donor may not be a wise choice in the design of dyes.
To sum up, the effect on IET performance originating from the electron-withdrawing auxiliary acceptor near to the anchoring part is double-sided. On the one hand, this auxiliary acceptor could reduce the orbital overlap and lead to a faster electron transfer process. On the other hand, it also could decrease the qCT and shorten the DCT. Nonetheless, given the excellent contribution of these auxiliary acceptors on the dye performance as discussed above, this molecular engineering strategy is still feasible for improving the overall properties of dyes in DSSCs. Therefore, to achieve the integral promotion of porphyrin dye performance, one must keep a good balance among the molecular structure, lighting absorption, photo-induced electron excitation and IET properties, and so on, by a reasonable molecular engineering strategy of introducing different auxiliary acceptors, adjusting the donors, acceptors, and π-bridge units. Our studies are expected to provide valuable insight for designing high-efficiency porphyrin-based organic dyes with new structures, and promote the practical applications of newly designed dyes in the DSSCs field.
4 Conclusions
A series of porphyrin dyes with the D–A′–π–A structure were designed and theoretically investigated to shed light on how the type and position of the auxiliary acceptor influenced the photoelectric performance of the dye by DFT and TD-DFT methods. The main points are summarized as follows.
The introduction of an electron-withdrawing auxiliary acceptor between the Zn-porphyrin core and the anchoring group had a significantly positive influence on optimizing the electron distribution in molecular orbitals, decreasing HOMO–LUMO energy gaps, thus broadening the absorption spectra and enhancing the light-harvesting capacities. More effective electron transition, lower orbital overlap, and a faster electron-transfer rate for long-range IET processes can be obtained. In this study, BTD and TPZ showed the best improvement effect on the overall performance of dyes and therefore, could be the best candidates for auxiliary acceptors.
Extending the longitudinal π-conjugation would enhance the electron-withdrawing capacity of auxiliary acceptors, thus reducing the HOMO–LUMO energy gap and broadening the absorption coverage. However, the electron-deficient performance of the auxiliary acceptor is not as strong as possible. The strong longitudinal π-conjugation of auxiliary acceptors could heighten the negative impact on the quantity and distance of electron-transfer, and weaken the accelerated effect on the IET process.
The introduction of an electron-withdrawing auxiliary acceptor between the donor and the Zn-porphyrin core has a tiny effect on reducing the HOMO–LUMO energy gap, which is not conducive to the formation of effective charge separation states in dyes. As such, this unwise molecular engineering strategy ought to be avoided in the design of porphyrin dyes.
