1. Introduction
As we know, the emergence and development of two-dimensional (2D) materials began with the discovery of graphene in 2004.1 The ultrathin, transparent, and flexible characteristics render 2D nanomaterials as promising and excellent candidates for next-generation optoelectronics, spintronics and photovoltaics.2–7 Nowadays, numerous 2D materials have been receiving a lot attention. Though the tremendous research effort is endeavoring in this direction, some stern problems are still encountered such as bandgap hurdles of graphene,8 poor stability of black phosphorus,9,10 low carrier mobility of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) monolayers.11,12 Thus, it is anticipated to explore the new 2D materials with moderate bandgap, high carrier mobility and good stability. Recently, the research in field of 2D functional materials is being expanded to the multiple-components compounds, including ternary and quaternary,13–18 and the applications of 2D materials have extended to all corners of electronic and optoelectronic devices, such as energy storage, energy conversion, and solar cells.2,19
Compared with traditional three-dimensional (3D) bulk materials, 2D materials have many natural advantages. The most important of these is the formation of heterojunctions, consisting of two types of donor and acceptor materials. Choosing suitable donor and acceptor materials, should have type II band alignments in the heterojunction, can make it possible to separate the electron–hole pairs at donor–acceptor interfaces, which is desirable in the applications of excitonic solar cells.20,21 In view of the demand of power conversion efficiency (PCE), when the heterojunction is applied in the excitonic solar cells, several other factors should be taken into account, such as a moderate direct bandgap of approximately 1.2–1.6 eV for strong visible-light absorption and high carrier mobility.22,23 In recent years, numerous 2D materials have been proposed as potential candidates of donor and acceptor in the heterojunction solar cells. Yang et al. have designed two Te/WTe2 and Te/MoTe2 heterojunction solar cells.24 Due to the high sunlight absorption and strong charge separation, the maximum PCEs for Te/WTe2 and Te/MoTe2 can reach to 20.1 and 22.5%, respectively.24 Ma et al. have reported an excellent 2D donor material HfTeSe4 with a moderate direct gap and strong visible-light absorption.13 The calculated PCE of HfTeSe4/Bi2WO6 heterojunction was up to 20.8%.13 Very recently, Kumar et al. have proposed a novel 2D β-PdX2 (X = S, Te) monolayer and described the optoelectronic properties required in heterojunction solar cells.25 The calculated PCEs of β-PdTe2/WTe2, β-PdTe2/MoTe2, β-PdTe2/β-PdS2 heterojunctions are as high as 23.14%, 20.59%, and 17.79%, respectively.25 However, as far as we know, the PCE of most 2D excitonic solar cells are still smaller than those of traditional monocrystalline silicon and some Cd-based and perovskite materials.26,27 Thus, exploring the suitable 2D photovoltaic donor and acceptor materials are still of great significance for improving the performance of solar cells.
As an individual research field of chemistry, metal-rich halide clusters, usually forming octahedral M6X12 and M6X8 type structures (M: group 3–7 metals; X = Cl, Br, I),28 exhibit the interesting cluster motifs and extensive applications. Tungsten chloride W6Cl12 with an octahedral W6-cluster core is a representative sample of the cluster compounds.29 In addition, the cyclobutadiene-like W4PCl11 compound is the first example of phosphorus-containing tungsten halide clusters, experimentally synthesized after reducing WCl6 with red phosphorus at 500 K.30 W4PCl11 represents a new type of a distorted rectangular phosphorus-centered W4Cl10 cluster and all rectangular clusters are interconnected by bridging chloride atoms. Bulk W4PCl11 is typical layered structure and the alternating layers are linked by van der Waals (vdW) interactions.30 Such vdW layered structure shows that W4PCl11 is a potential candidate of 2D materials. However, the corresponding structure and properties of 2D W4PCl11 monolayer are still missing.
In this work, based on density functional theory (DFT), a 2D material composed of P, W and Cl with stoichiometry W4PCl11 has been predicted. 2D W4PCl11 monolayer exhibits good dynamical and thermal stabilities and can be exfoliated from its bulk counterpart. Interestingly, our calculations show that W4PCl11 monolayer is a direct semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.25 eV, which endows the monolayer with very strong visible-light absorption in the magnitude of 105 cm−1. Considering the moderate direct bandgap and high carrier mobility, we conclude that W4PCl11 monolayer should be a superior candidate for the donor material of excitonic solar cells. The 2D W4PCl11/Bi2WO6 heterojunction has been constructed for simulating the photovoltaic performance as solar cells, and the estimated PCE reaches to 21.64%. All the promising properties reveal that 2D W4PCl11 monolayer have broad application prospects in the fields of photovoltaic devices.
2. Computational details
All computational works in this study were based on density functional theory (DFT) within the projected augmented wave (PAW) method,31 which was implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code.32,33 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) method of the generalized gradient approximation was applied for the exchange–correlation functional.34 A vacuum space of 20 Å was adopted to minimize the interlayer interaction between adjacent layers. A kinetic energy cut-off point of 500 eV was set for the plane wave basis in all calculations. Energy and force convergence criteria were set as 10−6 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1, respectively. Brillouin zone integration was carried out at 4 × 5 × 1 Γ-centered k-grid. The electronic band structure was also calculated by the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional.35 Phonon band dispersions were calculated on a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell by using the finite displacement method with the PHONOPY package.36 In the ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation, a 2 × 2 × 1 supercell was employed to minimize the constraint of periodic boundary conditions and the temperature was kept at 300 K for 10 ps with a time step of 2 fs in the NVT ensemble.37 The vdW interaction was corrected by the DFT-D3 method in Grimme scheme.38
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystal structure and stability
Phosphinidene-capped tungsten chloride cluster compound, W4PCl11, is a typical vdW layered material with C2/m (no. 12) space group and has been synthesized by reduction of WCl6 with elemental red phosphorus at around 500 °C in 2011.30 We first focus on the crystal structure of bulk W4PCl11, which features a Jahn–Teller distorted rectangular W4-cluster core. Such rectangular clusters are interconnected by bridging chloride atoms to form a vdW layered structure. The empty rectangular spaces within one layer are filled by chloro-phosphinidene ligands of adjacent layers, similar to a key-lock system. The fully optimized lattice parameters of the bulk W4PCl11 at the PBE-D3 level are a = 11.43 Å, b = 9.94 Å, and c = 13.20 Å, in good agreement with the experimental values.30 Like other 2D materials, the natural vdW layered structure of bulk W4PCl11 is very conducive to the formation of 2D monolayer and few-layers.
The optimized configuration of W4PCl11 monolayer with an orthorhombic structure (space group Pmmn, no. 59) is shown in Fig. 1(a). The calculated lattice constants of W4PCl11 monolayer are a = 11.45 Å and b = 9.91 Å. The atomic layer is composed of alternative phosphinidene-capped tungsten chloride clusters. Meanwhile, the primitive cell of W4PCl11 monolayer, which is stoichiometric composed of 8 W atoms, 2 P atoms and 22 Cl atoms, can be regarded as including two aforementioned clusters. In each cluster, the 4 W atoms form a rectangular W4 core and the distances between nearest W atoms within the rectangular cluster core are around 2.61 and 2.81 Å, consistent with the experimental results.30 Specially, each rectangular W4 core is capped by a chloro-phosphinidene ligand, possessing a W–P bond of 2.38 Å and a P–Cl bond of 2.04 Å. Micromechanical cleavage and liquid exfoliation are standard techniques to fabricate the 2D monolayers from their layered bulk counterparts. While the latter technique is suitable even for layered materials with strong interlayer interaction energy, the former one requires weak interlayer binding. Here, we theoretically studied the mechanical stripping process of W4PCl11 monolayer from its bulk counterpart. To simulate this exfoliation process, a model system containing four atomic layers is adopted to evaluate the change of total energy with respect to the cleavage distance. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the calculated cleavage energy (Ecl) of monolayer is around 0.16 J m−2, which shows that the separation ability of monolayer is significantly lower than those of graphene (0.31 J m−2) and black phosphorene (∼0.40 J m−2).14,39 Such result indicates that it is feasible to synthesize W4PCl11 monolayer from its bulk crystals by exfoliation method.

(b) Cleavage energy as a function of the cleavage distance between the top layer and bottom layer of W4PCl11. (c) Phonon dispersion of W4PCl11 monolayer.

The insets are the top view and side views of W4PCl11 monolayer at the end of the AIMD simulation. 
We then examine the structural stability of W4PCl11 monolayer. The phonon dispersion spectrum is shown in Fig. 1(c). It can be seen from the phonon spectrum that the monolayer W4PCl11 has not virtual vibration mode in the whole Brillouin region, which confirms the dynamical stability of W4PCl11 monolayer. The largest frequency reaches to 16.4 THz, which much larger than those of reported 2D materials.14,40,41 Besides, we also perform a long-time AIMD simulation to evaluate the thermal stability of W4PCl11 monolayer at room temperature. Fig. 1(d) shows that the total energy reaches to its equilibrium value quickly and then oscillate around it during the 10 ps simulation process. At the same time, there is no obvious bond breaking and the initial equilibrium cluster structure remains good during the simulation. Our AIMD results indicate that the W4PCl11 monolayer is thermally stable and can maintain its structural integrity at room temperature. Importantly, as its bulk counterpart is successfully fabricated, we strongly believe that the W4PCl11 monolayer can be easily prepared by exfoliation and chemical vapor deposition methods in experiment.
3.2. Electronic properties
The electronic band structure of W4PCl11 monolayer is shown in Fig. 2(a), which is calculated by using HSE06 functional. It is worth noting that the electronic band structure of W4PCl11 monolayer was also examined by the inclusion of spin–orbital coupling (SOC). Our calculations show that the SOC effect on the electronic band structure is extremely small. Thus, the SOC effect is not considered in this work. Obviously, the W4PCl11 monolayer possesses a direct bandgap of 1.25 eV at the HSE06 level and both the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) are located at the Γ point. Fortunately, this bandgap is just within the optimum range (around 1.2–1.6 eV) for excitonic solar cells. And the direct bandgap with moderate value can lead to efficient visible light absorption, indicating that W4PCl11 monolayer is a promising candidate for low-energy optical excitation and visible light harvesting. Notably, the band edge of CBM is relatively flat in the whole Brillouin region, which is similar to those of most 2D materials.14,40 The projected density of states (PDOS) of W4PCl11 monolayer is displayed in Fig. 2(b). Obviously, the multiple van Hove singularities (VHSs) can be found in the PDOS of W4PCl11 monolayer. The presence of VHSs may result in the favorable optical absorption quality. As shown in Fig. 2(b), both the VBM and CBM of W4PCl11 monolayer are mainly dominated by W atoms. Further analysis of atomic orbital components reveals that the VBM is mainly originated from the dxy and dyz orbitals of W atoms, while the CBM is primarily dominated by the dz2 and dxz orbitals of W atoms. Conversely, the contributions of p orbitals of Cl atoms on the VBM and CBM are relatively small. Even more, the P atoms has done almost nothing to the VBM and CBM. Such atomic orbital components are in consistent with the electron density distributions at CBM and VBM, as displayed in Fig. 2(c). The electron density distributions mainly concentrate on the W4 cluster cores, indicating the strong interactions between the adjacent W atoms. In addition, such strong interactions can result to the flat conduction band in the band structures. The unique flat-band properties of W4PCl11 monolayer may be interesting for some multifunctional applications, such as itinerant magnetism and light absorption.

3.3 Effects of strain on the electronic properties
Applying strain is an effective method to modulate the electronic properties of 2D materials. In practical device applications, 2D film materials are often subjected to strain or stress from the substrate or the external environment. To investigate the effects of strain on electronic properties, we calculate the electronic band structures of W4PCl11 monolayer under the conditions of small uniaxial strains in the range of −6%–6%. The strain is defined by changing the lattices as (a − a0)/a for x direction and (b − b0)/b for y direction, where a (a0) and b (b0) are the lattice constant of the strained (equilibrium) structures. Fig. 3 shows the corresponding HSE06 band structures with respect to the applied strains along the x and y directions, respectively. Fortunately, the CBM and VBM are always kept at the Γ point without offset under the applied strains of −6%–6%. Thus, the direct-bandgap nature of W4PCl11 monolayer does not change under small uniaxial strain. As we know, the structural deformations may arise during the process of material growth or device manufacturing. The robust direct-bandgap behavior is very crucial to its applications in photoelectric devices.
 Fig. 3  Electronic band structures of W4PCl11 monolayer under the in-plane uniaxial strains varying from −10% to 10% along the (a) x and (b) y directions, respectively. The band gaps are highlighted in blue. CB1 and CB2 represent the two lowest valence bands at the Γ point. For comparison, the energy of VBM is set to 0 eV. 
The bandgaps of W4PCl11 monolayer as a function of the in-plane uniaxial strains are plotted in Fig. 4(a). For applying strain along the x direction, the bandgap gradually increases with the increase of tensile strain (e.g., 1.25–1.31 eV) and decreases with the increase of compressive strain (e.g., 1.25–1.17 eV). However, the influence of the uniaxial strains along the y direction on the bandgap of W4PCl11 monolayer is relatively inconspicuous, manifesting that a narrow bandgap range of 1.21–1.25 eV versus the strain range of −6%–6% has been found in Fig. 4(a). More interestingly, the low-energy valence band are relatively sensitive to the uniaxial strains. Herein, the energy differences between the two lowest valence bands at the Γ point (defined as ΔE = ECB2 − ECB1) with respect to in-plane uniaxial strains are plotted in Fig. 4(b). It can be found that the energy difference ΔE gradually increases with the increase of tensile strain and nearly decreases with the increase of compressive strain. When applying the 6% (4%) tensile strain along the x(y) direction, the energies of CB1 and CB2 are almost equal and the flat bands across the entire Brillouin zones have been obtained in the band structures (see Fig. 3). The presence of the flat bands will dramatically increase the effective mass of electrons and influence the transport property of electrons in lattices. Meanwhile, such flat bands may be useful for the optical absorption capacity of W4PCl11 monolayer.

3.4 Mechanical properties
The mechanical properties of 2D W4PCl11 monolayer are studied by the strain-energy method based on the harmonic approximation. The elastic constants are calculated by using a finite difference method as implemented in the VASP code.42 The calculated results are C11 = 41.47 N m−1, C22 = 36.04 N m−1, C12 = 14.48 N m−1, and C66 = 24.29 N m−1, satisfying the Born criteria (C11C22 − C122 > 0 and C66 > 0)43 and demonstrating the good mechanical stability of W4PCl11 monolayer. At the same time, the elastic constants of W4PCl11 monolayer are much smaller than those of traditional 2D materials, such as graphene, MoS2, h-BN, and GaSe.44,45 Young's modulus Y(θ) and Poisson's ratio υ(θ) are essential parameters for mechanical property evaluation. For 2D orthorhombic systems, the Y(θ) and υ(θ) as a function of in-plane θ can be estimated from the formula46 (1) (2)where A = [(C11C22 − C122)/C66] − 2C12 and B = C11 + C22 − (C11C22 − C122)/C66. The angular-dependent Y(θ) and υ(θ) of 2D W4PCl11 monolayer are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). Obviously, the Y(θ) of W4PCl11 monolayer reaches the maximum value of 50.94 N m−1 when the θ is close to 45°, 135°, 225°, and 315°, while gradually decreases to 30.98 N m−1 at θ = 90° and 270°, suggesting the mechanical anisotropy. Notably, the Y(θ) at θ = 0° and 180° is 35.65 N m−1, which also differs from the value at θ = 90° and 270°. The Y(θ) range of 30.98–50.94 N m−1 is significantly smaller than those of graphene (340 N m−1),47 BN (318 N m−1),48 and MoS2 (123 N m−1),49 suggesting the good mechanical flexibility. Moreover, the υ(θ) of W4PCl11 monolayer reaches the highest value of 0.40 at θ = 0° and 180°, while gradually decreases to 0.43 at 45°, 135°, 225°, and 315°. The other two specific points are at θ = 90° and 270° and the corresponding υ(θ) is 0.35, different from that at 0° and 180°. The values of υ(θ) at any angles are positive and in a moderate range (0–0.5), means that W4PCl11 monolayer expands (contracts) laterally under compressive (tensile) strains.

To further explore the mechanical properties of W4PCl11 monolayer, we also calculate the stress–strain relations by using the method proposed by Roundy and Cohen.50 The stress as a function of tensile strain in the x and y directions are shown in Fig. 5(c). The results indicate that W4PCl11 monolayer can sustain the critical tensile strains of 13% and 15% in the x and y directions, respectively, which are comparable to those of MoS2 (6–11% or 22.5%)51,52 and α-boron (12% and 16%),53 but still smaller than those of graphene (19.4% and 26.6%),54 phosphorene (27% and 30%),55 InSeBr (21% and 33%),15 and Si2Te3 (38%).56 Thus, such critical tensile strains should be carefully considered in device applications for W4PCl11 monolayer to avoid mechanical fatigue and damage. As we know, the ideal tensile strength is a crucial factor to access the mechanical performance of bulk crystals, defined as the maximum stress a material can sustain at the critical condition of plastic deformation. Identically, we can use the equivalent stress to quantificationally analyze the ideal strengths of 2D W4PCl11 monolayer. As shown in Fig. 5(c), we obtain two very small critical stresses of 1.9 and 1.5 N m−1 in the x and y directions, respectively. Such ideal strengths of W4PCl11 monolayer are much lower than those of most reported 2D materials, such as α-boron (12.8 and 16 N m−1),53 MoS2 (15 N m−1),52 and Si2Te3 (8.63 N m−1),56 phosphorene (4 and 10 N m−1),55 BN (23.56 and 7.82 N m−1),57 InSeBr (4.94 and 4.72 N m−1),15 and g-ZnS (5.2 and 5 N m−1),58 suggesting that W4PCl11 monolayer is an extremely flexible 2D material and may have potential applications in the electronic and photoelectric devices with the flexibility requirements.
3.5 Carrier mobilities
Effective electron–hole separation and high charge mobility are two crucial aspects for the application of 2D materials. If the phonon scattering dominates the intrinsic mobility, as it is the typical case for inorganic semiconductors, the carrier mobility can be calculated by utilizing deformation potential (DP) theory,59 which has been proved to be an effective method in predicting the carrier mobilities of many 2D semiconductors. According to the DP theory, the carrier mobility can be described as60 (3)where e, T, and kB are electron charge, temperature, and Boltzmann constant, respectively. Ed is the DP constant, represents the displacement of CBM for electrons and VBM for holes caused by changing the lattice, and is defined as , where Eedge is the edge energy of the conduction (valence) energy band. C2D is the 2D in-plane elastic stiffness constant. The effective mass m* can be obtained by , where k is the wave vector and Ek is the energy corresponding to the wave vector k. md is the average effective mass, which is defined as . The calculated carrier mobilities μ and the corresponding values of m*, Ed, and C2D for electrons and holes are all summarized in Table 1.

It is found that the electron mobilities of W4PCl11 monolayer at 300 K are as high as 894.24 and 1083.79 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the x and y directions, respectively, which are larger than the hole mobilities of 113.49 and 703.04 cm2 V−1 s−1 along the x and y directions, respectively, mainly due to the difference in effective masses and DP constants. The magnitude of carrier mobilities reach to 103 cm2 V−1 s−1, indicating that the W4PCl11 monolayer possesses more superior transport property than that of MoS2 monolayer (200 cm2 V−1 s−1).61 Meanwhile, the carrier mobility of W4PCl11 monolayer shows unique direction-related anisotropy, manifesting as the larger carrier mobilities along y direction than those along x direction. Such anisotropy is attributed to the different bonding arrangement of adjacent atoms of W4-cluster cores in different directions. Besides, the mobility of electrons is obviously larger than that of holes, which is effective in promoting the separation of photo-excited carriers. As we know, strain engineering is an effective method to regulate electronic properties. Thus, the change of electronic band structure under the strain certainly will cause the change of transport properties for W4PCl11 monolayer. Moreover, the moderate direct bandgap and high carrier mobility endow the W4PCl11 monolayer with good application prospect in the field of photovoltaic devices.
3.6 Optical absorption and PCE for solar cells
The optical absorption ability has also been evaluated by calculating the optical absorbance. Fig. 6(a) shows the optical absorption spectrum of W4PCl11 monolayer, which is obtained by calculating the frequency-dependent complex dielectric function at the HSE06 level. The absorption coefficient α can be expressed by62,63 (4)where ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) are the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function, respectively. ω is the angular frequency and c is the speed of light.

(b) Schematic drawing of an W4PCl11/Bi2WO6 heterojunction. (c) Schematic diagram of the type-II donor–acceptor band alignment. (d) Power conversion efficiency (PCE) as a function of the donor bandgap Eg and conduction band offset ΔEc. 
It can be clearly seen that W4PCl11 monolayer shows strong optical absorption in the range of 1.0–5.5 eV and the corresponding optical absorption coefficient reaches to the magnitude of 105 cm−1, which is comparable to those of hybrid perovskite64,65 and indicate the excellent light harvesting performance of W4PCl11 monolayer. Remarkably, the absorption edge starts in the infrared light region, and then the strong absorption over a wide range of visible light (∼1.6–3.2 eV) is presence in the spectrum. Since the optical absorption coefficient directly corresponds to the electron transitions, we can qualitatively explain the absorption intensity from the PDOS in Fig. 2(b). The presence of VHSs in the PDOS of W4PCl11 monolayer will give rise to the strong light–matter interactions and thus enhance the optical absorption. Our calculations illustrate the potential of W4PCl11 monolayer to perform as a light harvesting compound.
The fact that W4PCl11 monolayer possesses the moderate direct bandgap and excellent optical absorption ability, indicating that 2D W4PCl11 monolayer can potentially serve as solar cell donor materials. To achieve high efficiency of photovoltaic conversion, appropriate acceptor material with matching band alignment must be found to form thin-film photovoltaic systems with W4PCl11 monolayer. From our HSE06 band structure calculation, we find the CBM and VBM of W4PCl11 monolayer are −4.52 and −5.78 eV, respectively, relative to the vacuum energy level. Based on the previous HSE06 calculation,13,66 we found that 2D Bi2WO6 monolayer is an ideal acceptor material for W4PCl11 monolayer. In experiment, 2D Bi2WO6 monolayer have been successfully synthesized and applied to photocatalytic field recently.67,68 The previous works show that 2D Bi2WO6 monolayer is an indirect semiconductor with the bandgap of 2.76 eV at the HSE06 level and the CBM and VBM of Bi2WO6 monolayer deducted by the vacuum energy level are −4.63 and −7.39 eV, respectively, matching those of W4PCl11 monolayer with the typical band alignment of type-II heterostructure.13,66 Thus, as shown in Fig. 6(b), we construct a heterostructure of W4PCl11 and Bi2WO6 monolayers to simulate the potential solar-cell devices. Very importantly, the small conduction band offset (about 0.1 eV) between the donor W4PCl11 and acceptor Bi2WO6 is beneficial for the transfer of photoelectron in the interface and then results in the high energy conversion efficiency, as displayed in Fig. 6(c). Herein, the 1 × 1 W4PCl11 primitive cell and 2 × 2 Bi2WO6 supercell are used to build the W4PCl11/Bi2WO6 heterojunction and the lattice mismatch is only 2%, which indicates the good feasibility for the experimental preparation of heterojunction.
Under the limit of 100% external quantum efficiency (EQE), the practical upper limit of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) η for such solar cell devices with type-II alignment can be described as69,70 (5)where 0.65 is the fill factor; Eg is the bandgap of the donor material and ΔEc is the conduction band offset between the acceptor and donor materials; (Eg − ΔEc − 0.3) represents an estimation value of the maximum open circuit voltage; P(ħϖ) is the AM1.5 solar energy flux at the photon energy ħϖ. The integral in the numerator represents the short circuit current performed in the limit of 100% EQE, while the integral in the denominator shows the incident solar radiation. The PCE contour of the heterojunction W4PCl11/Bi2WO6 as a function of the donor band gap Eg and conduction band offset ΔEc is shown in Fig. 6(d). It is important to note that the PCE calculated by eqn (5) is just the upper limit, and some factors should be considered in the practical devices, such as carrier mobility and the strength of interaction between the donor and accepter.
As highlighted with black star in Fig. 6(d), the potential solar-cell device composed of 2D W4PCl11/Bi2WO6 heterojunction could have a PCE η as high as 21.64%, which is comparable to or even larger than those of recently reported heterojunction systems, such as Te/WTe2 (22.5%),24 TiNF/TiNCl (22%),71 γ-BTe/GeP2 (21.76%),72 HfTeSe4/Bi2WO6 (20.8%),13 β-PdTe2/MoTe2 (20.59%),25 GeSe/SnS (18%),73 bilayer phosphorene/MoS2 systems (16–18%).70 Therefore, our proposed W4PCl11/Bi2WO6 heterojunction has the competitive advantage in the reported 2D heterojunction solar cells. In practice applications, introducing some appropriate interlayer materials may be very useful to improve the performance of solar cell devices and the related experimental investigations are anticipated in future.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, by first-principles calculations, we predicted a novel 2D semiconducting W4PCl11 monolayer and extensively studied its structural, mechanical, electronic, and optical properties. The small cleavage energy of 0.16 J m−2 indicates that W4PCl11 monolayer could be obtained from its bulk counterpart by suitable exfoliation methods. The dynamical and thermal stabilities have also been confirmed by the phonon spectrum calculations and AIMD simulations. Remarkably, the DFT calculations reveals that W4PCl11 monolayer is a direct semiconductor with a moderate bandgap of 1.25 eV at the HSE06 level and shows strong visible-light absorption. Such direct-bandgap characteristic can be maintained under the uniaxial strains in the range of −6%–6%. Meanwhile, the magnitude of carrier mobilities in W4PCl11 monolayer reach to 103 cm2 V−1 s−1. Very importantly, we conclude that W4PCl11 monolayer should be a superior candidate for the donor material of excitonic solar cells. The estimated PCE of W4PCl11/Bi2WO6 heterojunction can reach as high as 21.64%, which is comparable to or even larger than those of recently reported heterojunction systems. All the promising properties reveal that 2D W4PCl11 monolayer have broad application prospects in the fields of photovoltaic devices.
