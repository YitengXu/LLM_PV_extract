    , Accepted 31st May 2018First published on 2nd June 2018AbstractNickel phthalocyanine (NiPcS4) was doped into PEDOT:PSS to act as a very efficient hole transporting layer (HTL) for inverted perovskite solar cells (PSC). The PCE (power conversion efficiency) can reach up to 19.0% depending on the ratio of the two components. The PCE for the doped HTL is significantly higher than those for the individual components, i.e., 16.47% and 9.29% for PEDOT:PSS and NiPcS4, respectively. The stability of the PSCs was also significantly improved in air. UPS, AFM, SEM, and optical spectra studies revealed the following factors contributing to the improvement in PCE of the modified PSCs: (1) enhanced photon absorption; (2) improved film quality of perovskite; (3) enhanced hole transporting; (4) increased cell stability; and (5) enhanced work function of HTL. These results suggest that the phthalocyanine–PEDOT composites can be good hole transporting materials.
Introduction
Photovoltaic (PV) devices generate electricity directly from sunlight, which could be one of the main energy sources in the future due to its wide accessibility, sustainability, and cleanness, particularly after fossil fuel resources are depleted.1,2 While the current crystalline silicon solar cells (CSSC) are not cost-effective as compared to other devices in the electricity generation industry, organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising alternatives, since their power conversion efficiencies (PCE) have increased to 22.1% from 3.8% in the last several years.3–5 This development has been much faster than that of OPV (organic photovoltaics), DSSC (dye-sensitized solar cells), and other PV materials. In addition to achieving high efficiencies, the interest in PSCs has also increased due to their easier fabrication and low-cost.3–5
Currently, the main research focus for PSCs is the further improvement of their PCEs and stability.3–5 Using alternative hole transport layers (HTLs) other than PEDOT:PSS or spiro-OMeTAD to increase PCE and stability is one of the primary approaches.6–17 PEDOT:PSS is usually used in the p–i–n (also called inverted) type of PSCs, while doped spiro-OMeTAD is often employed in the n–i–p type (regular or normal type) of PSCs. HTLs are key components in perovskite solar cells, and can accelerate and increase hole extraction from the perovskite material and conduct holes to the cathode. HTLs can simultaneously act as electron-blocking layers to prevent charge recombination.10
In this study, we focus on the HTL of inverted planar PSCs. Currently, inverted (p–i–n) planar PSCs have yielded comparable PCE of 20.3%,18 but show much lower hysteresis than regular mesoporous PSCs.19,20 The fabrication of inverted planar PSCs consumes less energy, reduces cost, and is more feasible for spin-coating on a flexible plastic substrate compared to the fabrication of regular PSCs. In inverted planar PSCs, PEDOT:PSS is usually the hole-transporting material. PEDOT is a conducting polymer with good optical transparency in its conducting state, and has high stability, moderate band gap, and low redox potential. A significant disadvantage of PEDOT is its poor solubility, which is partly circumvented in the PEDOT:PSS composite. Due to the inability to block electrons and its hygroscopic nature, PEDOT:PSS typically limits the PCE and stability of inverted planar PSCs.
Various inorganic, organic, polymeric, and nanoscale materials and their composites have been tested as alternatives to PEDOT:PSS. Graphene oxide (GO) has been used as the HTL in PSCs, but the PCE of 12.4% of such PSCs is still significantly lower than that of PSCs with PEDOT:PSS.21 Researchers later employed the composite of GO and PEDOT:PSS,22–25 and the PCE was indeed increased. For example, sequential deposition of PEDOT:PSS and GO formed a double layer HTL and the corresponding PSC showed a PCE of 15.34%, which is higher than that of the PSC with PEDOT:PSS monolayer HTL (11.90%).22 Furthermore, a PSC with optimized PEDOT:GO composite monolayer HTL showed a PCE of 18.09%,23 which was higher than that of PSC with pristine PEDOT:PSS film (14.95%), and both devices had negligible J–V hysteresis.23
Inorganic materials, such as NiO,26 CuSCN,27 CuI,28 and heavily p-doped LiNiMgO29 were also tested as HTLs, among which the PSC with LiNiMgO attained the highest PCE of 16.2%.29 The composites of some inorganic materials with PEDOT:PSS have also been examined as HTLs, such as GeO2-doped PEDOT:PSS,30 NiOx–PEDOT:PSS,31 and MoOx–PEDOT:PSS;32 the corresponding PSCs have shown PCEs exceeding 15% due to the improved hole transport ability and higher coverage of the perovskite films as compared to the PSC with PEDOT:PSS.
Phthalocyanines (PCs) are a large family containing tens of thousands of compounds; they are excellent organic semiconducting materials, and have recently been shown to be suitable for HTLs in PSCs.33–65 The PCE of PC HTL PSCs has rapidly enhanced to 17.3% (ref. 64) from 3.5% (ref. 47) in the last three years by changing the central metal or peripheral substituents of PC structures. However, all of the PCs in these studies have been tested as HTLs in normal PSCs with the exception of copper PC, which was used in a PEDOT:PSS composite for an inverted PSC that achieved a PCE of 17.29%.62
In this study, we used NiPcS4 (nickel phthalocyanine tetrasulphonate sodium salt, Fig. 1), PEDOT:PSS, and their composites as HTLs for inverted PSCs. We found that a PCE of 18.90% was obtained when 10 wt% NiPcS4 was doped into PEDOT:PSS. This PCE is the highest so far among the reported alternatives of PEDOT:PSS.

Results and discussion
A PCE of 18.90% was obtained for PSC with NiPcS4-doped PEDOT:PSS (10 wt%) as the HTL, which is remarkably higher than that of PSCs with PEDOT:PSS and NiPcS4 alone (Table 1). This finding motivated us to conduct detailed studies on the property–mechanism relationship of HTL compositions.

The UPS spectra of the PEDOT:PSS film, the NiPcS4 film, and the composite film of NiPcS4-doped PEDOT:PSS (10 wt%) are displayed in Fig. 2, together with the photoemission cutoffs in the inset. The work functions of PEDOT:PSS, NiPcS4, and NiPcS4-doped PEDOT:PSS (10 wt%) were calculated to be 5.08, 5.11, and 5.14 eV, respectively. The composite film exhibits larger work function than that of PEDOT:PSS by about by 0.06 eV, thus facilitating more efficient hole transport and extraction between ITO and the CH3NH3PbI3 active layer.

The device structure and the relative energy levels of the device components for the inverted PSC are shown in Fig. 3. Upon light irradiation, the excited electron–hole pairs are generated and separated from the perovskite layer in the cell device. The presence of NiPcS4 shifts the LUMO energy level of the HTL to −1.8 eV from −3.48 eV of pure PEDOT:PSS. Therefore, NiPcS4 can much more efficiently block the electron transport from the PV layer to the HTL while still facilitating effective hole transport along the path PV → HTL → ITO. Moreover, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels fully match the requirement of electron transport in the path PV → PCBM → silver electrode. The thickness of the HTL, perovskite layer, and ETL (electron transporting layer) are typical for an inverted PSC. For example, FIM (Focused Ion Beam) cross-section images revealed that the average thickness of the HTL, perovskite layer, ETL, and silver electrode are 362, 298, 142 nm, and 50 nm respectively for the device with NiPcS4-doped PEODT:PSS (10 wt%) as the HTL.

The device performance was determined by measuring the photovoltaic parameters of Jsc, FF, Voc, and PCE (Table 1). Fig. 4 shows the J–V curves of PSCs with pristine PEDOT:PSS, NiPcS4, and PEDOT:PSS–NiPcS4 composite films as HTLs. Fig. 5 shows the EQE curves of PSCs with pristine PEDOT:PSS, NiPcS4 and PEDOT:PSS–NiPcS4 composite films as HTLs.

The data shown in Fig. 4a and Table 1 indicate that HTL materials significantly influence the PCE and other photovoltaic parameters. A PCE of 9.29% was obtained for the PSC with NiPcS4 alone as the HTL. This lower PCE is due to the poor film-forming ability of NiPcS4 on the ITO substrate (Fig. 6), which further affects the perovskite crystallization on its underlayer.66 The device performance was improved (Table 1) on adopting a bilayer HTL of PEDOT:PSS–NiPcS4 regardless of the deposition sequence. For the composite HTL, the ratio of NiPcS4/PEDOT:PSS remarkably affects the cell performance. The best performance with PCE 18.90%, Voc 1.08 V, Jsc 23.01 mA cm−2, and fill factor of 77% was obtained when the NiPcS4/PEDOT:PSS ratio is 10%. For the control device with only PEDOT:PSS as the HTL, the photovoltaic values are typical (PCE 16.47%, Voc 1.02 V, Jsc 21.12 mA cm−2, and fill factor 73%). Compared to the control device, the PCE is increased by 15% for the device with PEDOT:PSS + NiPcS4 (10 wt%) as the HTL. This increase, however, is not due to any single factor among Voc, Jsc, and fill factor, but due to their simultaneous enhancement by 5.9%, 4.0% and 5.5%, respectively. The hysteresis for the inverted PSC is negligible (Fig. 4b) since the forward and the backward J–V curves are almost identical. In addition, the scan rate of the measurements had no influence on the J–V curves (Fig. 4c). PCE and Jsc values varied slightly over the period of ten minute-measurements (Fig. 4d).

Fig. 5a shows the EQE and integrated Jsc values at different wavelengths. The EQE and Jsc for NiPcS4-doped PEDOT:PSS (10 wt%) HTL are higher than those for PEDOT:PSS and NiPcS4 HTLs, which is consistent with the results from J–V measurements (Fig. 4a). Fig. 5b shows the time-dependent PCEs in the doped devices and control devices as well as the normalized PCEs. These cell devices were stored and analyzed without encapsulation and under the same conditions (in atmosphere with 60% humidity at room temperature). It was observed that the stability improved for these modified cell devices (Fig. 5b). The composite HTL [NiPcS4-doped PEDOT:PSS (10 wt%)]-based device exhibited longer lifetimes than the control devices. This increase in the cell stability is due to the stable composite HTL consisting of PEDOT:PSS and NiPcS4.
To reveal the reason behind the improved device performance, the absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured and shown in Fig. 5 for ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PV, ITO/NiPcS4/PV, and ITO/NiPcS4-doped PEDOT:PSS (10 wt%)/PV samples, in which PV = CH3NH3PbI3. After doping NiPcS4 into PEDOT:PSS, the PL of CH3NH3PbI3 quenched much more effectively by the composite HTL (Fig. 5d). This result indicates that doping NiPcS4 leads to more effective hole transport in the composite HTL, thus improving the PCE and Jsc.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite deposited on three different HTL films are shown in Fig. 5c, in which the characteristic absorption band position and shape of the three samples are nearly identical, but the absorption intensity changes remarkably. The absorption intensity increased in the order ITO/NiPcS4/PV < ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PV < ITO/NiPcS4-doped PEDOT:PSS/PV, which is the same as the order for PCE, Jsc and Voc values. This trend evidences that the enhanced photon absorption in the entire visible range is a major factor leading to the improved cell performance. NiPcS4-doped PEDOT:PSS/PV shows higher absorption than that of undoped PEDOT:PSS/PV due to the contribution from NiPcS4 as this phthalocyanine in film state is aggregated and absorbs widely from the UV to NIR region (Fig. S2 in ESI†).

Fig. 6a–c show the AFM images of PEDOT:PSS, NiPCS4-doped PEDOT:PSS (10 wt%), and NiPcS4 films; their root mean-square (RMS) values are 2.1, 1.5, and 1.8 nm, respectively. This indicates that a smooth composite film, which helps the growth of perovskite films, could be formed by doping PEDOT:PSS with NiPcS4. The SEM images of the perovskite films are presented in Fig. 6d–f. Using PEDOT:PSS as the HTL, the perovskite film exhibits smaller grain sizes with small pinholes and voids between the crystalline domains. The NiPcS4-based perovskite film shows poor film coverage because of many large voids. In the case of NiPcS4-doped PEDOT:PSS composite as the underlayer, the perovskite film displays improved coverage area and fewer pinholes and voids.
Conclusions
Using PEDOT:PSS containing NiPcS4 (10 wt%) as the HTL in an inverted PSC, PCE was remarkably increased to 18.9%. This is because the presence of NiPcS4 (10 wt%) (1) endows the perovskite film with improved coverage area and fewer pinholes and voids; (2) enhances photon absorption in the entire visible region; (3) leads to more effective hole transport in the composite HTL; (4) increases cell stability; and (5) leads to larger work function than that of PEDOT:PSS. We believe that NiPcS4-doped hole transport layers can be used for other perovskite absorbers (such as FAPbI3), which will be investigated in future studies.

Nickel phthalocyanine-3,4′,4′′,4′′′-tetrasulfonated tetrasodium (NiPcS4) was synthesized following the procedure in literature,67,68 and was characterized by HRMS and UV-vis absorption spectrum (ESI†). Lead acetate trihydrate (PbAc2·3H2O) was purchased from Aladdin Industrial Corporation.

China.
Mixed PEDOT:PSS–NiPcS4 thin films
Various weight ratios of NiPcS4 (5, 10, 20, and 30 wt%) were added to the aqueous PEDOT:PSS solutions. Following this, the resulting solutions were magnetically stirred for more than three hours at room temperature, and then filtered by polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filters (0.45 μm) and subsequently utilized for thin films' fabrication. The NiPcS4-treated PEDOT:PSS thin films were prepared through spin-coating the above blended solutions, followed by thermal annealing at 140 °C for about twenty minutes in air. The thicknesses of NiPcS4-treated PEDOT:PSS thin films was regulated by varying the spin-rate from 2000 to 5000 rpm.
Fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution
3MAI:PbAc2·xH2O precursor solutions were prepared according to our previously reported method.69 To generate the 3MAI:PbAc2·xH2O precursor solution with x equal to 0, PbAc2·3H2O was first heated to 110 °C for 12 h in a glove box to obtain anhydrous PbAc2. PbAc2·xH2O was then obtained by mixing PbAc2 with PbAc2·3H2O at a molar ratio of (3 − x):x. Finally, MAI and PbAc2·xH2O were dissolved in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide at a 3:1 molar ratio with the concentration of 45 wt% (optimal x = 2.8).
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
The device structure is ITO/HTL/perovskite CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/BCP/Ag, in which HTL is one of NiPcS4, PEDOT:PSS, or mixed NiPcS4–PEDOT:PSS. Patterned ITO coated glass substrates were sequentially cleaned in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. The substrate was then desiccated in an oven, before treating in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber for about twenty minutes. Pristine PEDOT:PSS, NiPcS4, or mixed PEDOT:PSS–NiPcS4 aqueous solutions filtered by a 0.45 μm filter tip were spin-coated at around 4000 rpm for approximately 50 seconds on ITO electrodes, before baking at 140 °C for about 20 minutes in the ambient atmosphere. Subsequently, the substrates were shifted to a nitrogen-filled glove-box, where a ≈400 nm-thick CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer was deposited on the surface of either the pristine PEDOT:PSS layer, NiPcS4 layer or mixed NiPcS4–PEDOT:PSS layer through a one-step solution casting approach. Detailed procedures were according to our previously reported method:69 perovskite films were spin-coated from set 80 °C precursor solutions at a speed of around 4000 rpm for about 50 seconds, in which the substrate temperature was maintained at 90 °C; then, they were annealed on a hotplate at 90 °C for another 10 minutes. After cooling to room temperature, PC61BM (dissolved in CB, 20 mg mL−1) was spin-coated over the perovskite layer at 1000 rpm for another 30 seconds, and finally annealed at 80 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, C60 (20 nm), BCP (8 nm) and the metal silver (100 nm) electrode were thermally evaporated in a vacuum chamber at pressure set at <4 × 10−4 Pa through a shadow mask. Photoactive regions of the devices were 0.08 cm2.
Characterization of perovskite solar cells
The J–V measurements of the devices under AM1.5 G solar 100 mW cm−2 simulator illumination (Enlitech Solar Simulator SS-F5-3A) was performed on a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit in air (60% humidity) at room temperature without encapsulation. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured under ambient atmosphere at room temperature using a DSR100UV-B spectrometer with a SR830 lock-in amplifier. The steady-state PCE was measured by monitoring current with the largest power output bias voltage and recording the value of the photocurrent. A xenon lamp was used as the light source.
Other characterizations
The AFM images were obtained by the Bruker Dimension Icon in the ScanAsyst mode. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained by the field-emission SEM (FEI Nova_Nano SEM 430). The X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained by a Bruker ECO D8 (Bruker, Germany). The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of the perovskite films were obtained by the spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Lambda 750). UPS analysis was conducted to measure the energy level of HTLs with an unfiltered He I (21.22 eV) gas discharge lamp and a hemispherical analyzer.
