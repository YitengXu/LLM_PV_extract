    AbstractA fullerene attached all-semiconducting polymer was synthesized and applied to single component polymer photovoltaic cells. The current approach gives a method of obtaining a reliable donor acceptor mixing morphology by molecular design and achieving efficient photovoltaic devices with long thermal stability.
Solution-processable organic solar cells are an important research topic in exploring the possibility of producing a low-cost, large-area, and printable, flexible energy source.1,2 Due to the limited exciton diffusion length of the organic materials (ca. 10 nm), organic solar cells need a close arrangement of an electron donor and acceptor material in thin films to achieve efficient charge separation, and simultaneous formation of an interpenetrated network of each component could be a key factor for efficient charge transport. The physical mixture of the donor and acceptor materials, the so-called mixed bulk heterojunction, has been intensively studied to achieve this “ideal” morphology.3 However, even though the mixing morphologies could be controlled to some extent by process optimizations such as thermal annealing or solvent components, there is a limitation to the structures that can be obtained by this approach. Furthermore, morphologies achieved by mixing are generally not thermodynamically stable but are metastable states, which often lead to the deterioration of device performance after operation above the glass transition temperatures of the materials due to the large phase segregation of the components.4 This can be a significant problem for the device application in the future.
Recently, there have been reports of attempts to achieve ordered nanostructures through self-organization of the molecules by using semiconducting oligomers5–11 or copolymers12–18 with a covalently attached acceptor such as fullerene or perylenediimide derivatives. These single-component systems have potential advantages over the mixed bulk heterojunction systems such as simplicity of the fabrication process and the construction of thermodynamically stable nanostructures that can be fine-tuned by the molecular designs. The highest power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 1.50% and 0.52% were obtained thus far with an oligomer and a polymer system, respectively.11,14 These performances are still lower than those of the corresponding state-of-the-art mixed bulk heterojunction systems. It seems that solar cells based on these single-component systems generally suffer from low fill factors, suggesting poor connectivity of the charge transport paths in the films.10,19 In addition, a study of the thermal stability of the film morphology and the device performance is limited to the use of the copolymers as a compatibilizer in physically mixed bulk heterojunctions.20–22 Particularly in the polymer-based systems, microphase separation of block copolymers would be a promising driving force to achieve ordered and stable donor/acceptor distribution morphology suitable for solar cell application through self-organization.12,13,16–18 However, precise structural control of the acceptor-grafted diblock copolymers with an all-conjugated backbone could be a crucial factor.
In this communication, we report the synthesis of poly(3-alkylthiophene)-based diblock copolymers with a fullerene attached block and their application in single component polymer solar cells. The film morphology and device stability are discussed by comparison with the corresponding random copolymers and the mixed bulk heterojunctions.
The fullerene-attached diblock copolymer was synthesized as shown in Scheme 1. Briefly, diblock copolymers of 3-hexylthiophene and 3-(6-bromohexyl)thiophene were synthesized by Ni-catalyzed quasi-living polymerization following previously reported procedures.4,23,24 Corresponding random copolymer was also synthesized by using the mixed monomers. GPC charts show the number-averaged molecular weights of the polymers (Mn) are 24300 and 21700 for the diblock and the random copolymer, respectively, and the polydispersity index is lower than 1.1. The bromides at the side chains of the polymers were quantitatively converted to azides by NaN3. The fullerene derivative with an alkyne was then attached to the side chain through the “click” cycloaddition reaction.25–271H NMR spectra confirm the structure of the polymers, and the unit ratio between 3-hexylthiophene and the fullerene-attached thiophene was estimated as 89:11 and 87:13 for the block and random copolymers, respectively, which corresponds to contents of fullerene 3 in polymers of 38 wt% and 41 wt%, respectively. This corresponds to the ratio of P3HT:PCBM = 1.0:0.6 by weight for mixed bulk heterojunctions, which is close to the reported optimum conditions. Both the diblock and random copolymers with the fullerenes can be dissolved in CHCl3 and chlorobenzene.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) phase images of the block copolymer film show a clear nanopattern with a size of about 20 nm as shown in Fig. 1a. This pattern is similar to the microphase separation patterns of diblock copolymers based on poly(3-alkylthiophene)s described in a previous report.23,24 In contrast, the random copolymer film with a similar amount of fullerenes attached to the side chains showed no such pattern under AFM (Fig. 1b). UV-vis absorption spectra of the fullerene-attached diblock and random copolymers in Fig. 2a are both similar to a P3HT:PCBM physical mixture (P3HT:PCBM = 1.0:0.6 by weight) in solution. The amounts of fullerene estimated by the absorption intensity at 260 nm and 330 nm agree with those of the fullerene-attached thiophene estimated by 1H NMR. UV-vis spectra of the fullerene-attached diblock copolymer film in Fig. 2b showed red-shifted absorption and a shoulder around 610 nm, indicating the existence of a crystalline P3HT domain,28 which is similar to that of a physically mixed bulk heterojunction film. In contrast, the random copolymer shows little red-shift of the absorption compared to that in solution and no absorption shoulder. This can be attributed to the disordered structures of the main chains due to the strong aggregation tendency of the fullerenes randomly distributed on the side chains.

Single component solar cells were fabricated with the diblock and the random copolymer films. I–V curves under simulated solar light irradiation (AM 1.5) are shown in Fig. 3a. The solar cell performance of the fullerene-attached block copolymer after thermal annealing at 130 °C showed a PCE of 1.70% with an ISC of 6.15 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.54 V, and an FF of 0.51. This is the highest performance among the single-component donor–acceptor dyad systems so far.11,14 In addition, the relatively high FF suggests that efficient charge transport paths could be constructed in the diblock copolymer films similar to those in the mixed bulk heterojucntions. External quantum efficiency (EQE) reached 49% at 515 nm. On the other hand, the control device with the fullerene attached random copolymer showed much lower device performance (PCE of 0.48% with ISC of 1.80 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.76 V and FF of 0.35). Furthermore, thermal annealing of the random copolymer film did not improve device performance in contrast to the block copolymer device. These results clearly show the importance of the block structure for solar cell application.

(b) PCE change in the solar cells with the fullerene-attached block copolymer (square) and those with the P3HT:PCBM physical mixture (1.0:0.6 by weight) (triangle) at 130 °C. 
The thermal stability of the diblock copolymer device was studied and compared to that of the physically mixed bulk heterojunctions of P3HT and PCBM. Although the initial performance of the mixed bulk heterojunctions (3.0%) was higher than that of the fullerene-attached diblock copolymer, degradation of the device proceeded at high speed during prolonged annealing at 130 °C (Fig. 3b). Optical microscopic images of the mixed film after the annealing (Fig. 4b) showed the appearance of needle-like aggregations of PCBM with a size of about 50 μm, which is similar to the findings of a previous report.4 This phase separation could cause performance degradation in the physically mixed bulk heterojunction system. In striking contrast, the solar cell performance of the diblock copolymer device showed a small change in PCE from 1.59% to 1.50% after annealing at 130 °C for 80 h. The diblock copolymer film showed no PCBM aggregation under optical microscopy (Fig. 4a). These results suggest that the microphase-separated structure of the diblock copolymers can stabilize the film morphology and, simultaneously, the device performance.

In summary, we demonstrated that the application of a fullerene-attached all-semiconducting diblock copolymer with a well-defined structure can be advantageous in controlling the film morphology and improving the morphological stability of the films. Combined with recently developed low band gap polymers, the current strategy could be one of the ways to achieve an efficient, reliable, and stable single-component polymer solar cell.
