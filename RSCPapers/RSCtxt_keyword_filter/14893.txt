    , Accepted 24th February 2017First published on 9th March 2017AbstractFour organic dyes specifically designed for application in dye-sensitized solar cells are reported. These dyes are based on a perfectly identical π-conjugated backbone and only differ by the number and the nature of the alkyl chain substituents employed as solubilizing groups. These sensitizers have outstanding light absorption properties in the visible range up to 750 nm on TiO2 and they exhibit quite similar energy level positions. Solar cells fabricated and characterized under exactly the same conditions with iodine-based liquid electrolytes show performances ranging from 6.53% to 9.05%. We highlight that the nature and the number of solubilizing groups have a tremendous impact on the performances of solar cells. The differences in the performance of the four sensitizers can be correlated with the current generation, the formation of aggregates and the dye-loading on the electrodes. We also report solar cells with ionic liquid electrolytes that demonstrate power conversion efficiencies up to 7.81% and a good stability of the performances under accelerated ageing conditions for 7300 hours. We establish that the number and the type of solubilizing groups attached on the π-conjugated backbone of the dyes have a strong influence not only on the performances but also on the lifetimes of the devices; i.e. the dyes that contain lower ratios of alkyl groups lead to the more stable cells.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are a promising new generation of photovoltaic devices which have demonstrated performances close to those of amorphous or microcrystalline silicon solar cells in recent years.1 Besides they can perform efficiently in many non-ideal light environments such as dim, diffuse and indoor light.2 They are on the verge of wide-scale commercialization for Building Integrated PhotoVoltaics (BIPV)3 but still face challenging issues to solve such as long-term stability, materials cost and ability to be recycled.
Many of these issues are rooted in the liquid phase of the cell, and dye/electrolyte pairing. In particular, the reliance on rare earth ruthenium as the active constituent of dyes has strong implications on the raw material cost and could potentially be difficult to source in long term.
To increase the commercial attractiveness of this technology, one strategy consists in developing cheap, stable and highly efficient organic dyes of various colours. Indeed organic dyes as alternatives to ruthenium-based sensitizers exhibit many advantages such as higher molar extinction coefficients and tuneable optoelectronic properties, and some of them can be prepared quite easily.4
Several families of dyes have been investigated so far to replace ruthenium-based sensitizers.5 Among them, porphyrin dyes have been explored for DSSCs due to their strong absorption bands in a wide wavelength range6,7 and the possibility to modulate their optoelectronic properties by embedding additional conjugated units, such as thiophene and benzo-thiadiazole (BTD), in their chemical structures.8 This approach has been successful since power conversion efficiency (PCE) close to 13% has been reached when zinc-porphyrin dyes are associated with a cobalt-based electrolyte.9
Unfortunately the overall yields of preparation of functionalized porphyrin dyes are low, and the devices comprising these compounds have not yet reached long term stability.10
For real applications and future industrial developments of DSSCs, in addition to high PCEs, long device lifetimes are required. For these reasons metal-free organic sensitizers appear as a valuable alternative. This class of dyes has triggered real interest over the last few years, since they can be easily synthesized from cheap precursors and their optoelectronic properties can be modulated at will by chemical design.11 Recently, organic dyes with a D–π–A chemical structure have reached over 12% efficiency in a DSSC configuration using cobalt-based electrolytes12,13 and over 10% using a more conventional iodine-based electrolyte.14–17
For the preparation of organic dyes, chemists have the choice between a large variety of building blocks and chromophores. The novel generations of organic sensitizers are based on several kinds of electron-withdrawing units such as quinoxaline,18 benzotriazole,19 diketopyrrolopyrrole,20 isoindigo21 or benzothiadiazole14,22,23 to name a few. These chromophores are usually incorporated into the π-conjugated bridge that connects the donor group to the anchoring acceptor group to tailor the optical properties and control the energy level positions. Indeed, the use of a π-conjugated bridge combining electron-rich aromatic rings and an electron-poor unit is a powerful strategy that can help improving the absorption capability of the final system, thanks to the generation of an additional internal charge transfer (ICT) absorption band. Such dyes with a D–A–π–A23 or a D–π–A–π–A24 structure showing an extended π-conjugated system are particularly interesting to demonstrate good photovoltaic performances but they often suffer from a lack of solubility in classical solvents that may limit their practical use in solar cells. Solubility is considered to be an important factor since poorly soluble dyes usually tend to aggregate during the dyeing step of the electrodes resulting in less efficient and less stable devices.25
Although numerous studies have been published on the variation of the π-conjugated structures of organic dyes and the elucidation of structure–property relationships,26 to the best of our knowledge there is no work specifically dedicated to understanding how the alkyl groups of organic dyes, that are usually introduced to promote their solubility, can influence both the photovoltaic performances and the stability of devices.
Therefore in this study we have synthesized and studied four different organic dyes based on a perfectly similar π-conjugated chemical structure. These sensitizers contain a BTD unit flanked by two bithiophene segments and they only differ by the number and the nature of the solubilizing groups attached to the π-conjugated backbone. The four dyes have been fully characterized spectroscopically and electrochemically prior to their use for the fabrication of DSSCs with iodine/triiodide-based liquid electrolytes. We have evaluated their photovoltaic performances and performed incident-photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE), charge extraction (CE) and transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements to better understand the cells operation.
We highlight in this work, the usually underestimated impact of the solubilizing groups on the photovoltaic performances of organic dyes. We demonstrate that the PCE of sensitizers, showing a perfectly similar π-conjugated system and tested under exactly identical conditions, can be significantly improved by appropriate engineering of the side-chains. By swapping linear alkyl chains with branched alkyl chains, that improve the solubility and impede the undesirable aggregation of the dyes, the PCE of the solar cells rises from 6.53% to 9.05%.
Finally we have fabricated and characterized solar cells with an ionic liquid electrolyte. These devices demonstrated PCEs up to 7.81% and revealed a quite high stability under ISOS-L2 ageing test conditions for 7000 h. We also demonstrate that the number and the type of solubilizing groups attached on the π-conjugated backbone of the dyes, unexpectedly, have a strong influence on the lifetimes of the devices.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of the dyes
Aiming to make a clear comparison, four dyes based on an identical π-conjugated backbone and bearing different solubilizing groups were synthesized. The dyes exhibit a D–π–A–π–A chemical design and BTD was employed as the auxiliary acceptor in the structure. Two of the dyes, namely PK1 and PK2, contain respectively two linear alkyl chains (octyl) or branched alkyl chains (2-ethyl-hexyl) attached to the central thiophene units. PK3 contains an additional linear octyl chain on one of the thiophenes compared to PK1 whereas 6PK1 contains two linear hexyl chains attached on the phenyl groups of the triphenylamine compared to PK1. The molecular structures of the dyes are presented in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Structure and synthesis of dyes with the same π-conjugated system and different alkyl chains. 
The synthesis of PK1 was reported in a previous study27 and PK2 and 6PK1 were prepared following a quite similar synthetic route. For the preparation of PK1 and 6PK1, 4,7-bis(5′-bromo-3-octyl-2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole27 (1) was used as a precursor whereas its analogue with ramified alkyl chains, 4,7-bis(5′-bromo-3-2-ethylhexyl-2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole28 (2), was employed for the preparation of PK2. The synthetic routes and conditions are presented in Fig. 1.
Starting from (1) or (2), the introduction of the triphenylamine (TPA) donor moiety and the phenyl-carbonyl group was carried out by two successive Suzuki cross-coupling reactions with rather good yields ranging from 40% to 95%. To finish, a Knœvenagel condensation reaction was performed with cyano-acetic acid to access the desired dyes: PK1, PK2 and 6PK1. This last reaction was conducted through refluxing a mixture of acetonitrile and chloroform in the presence of a small amount of piperidine.
Regarding the preparation of PK3 with a supplementary linear alkyl chain on the central core, a convergent synthetic strategy was adopted. 4,7-Bis(5-bromo-4-octylthiophen-2-yl)benzo[c]-[1,2,5]thiadiazole (8) was prepared according to a previously reported procedure29 and used as the starting material. The precursor (7) that was synthesized in two steps from 4-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-benzaldehyde (see Scheme S1†) was then coupled to (8) via the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction to obtain the intermediate (9). This intermediate was coupled to the stannic compound (10)4 under Stille coupling conditions, to access the aldehyde derivative (11). Finally, PK3 was obtained from (11) via the Knœvenagel condensation reaction using the same experimental conditions as previously described.
Optical and electrochemical properties
The absorption and emission properties of the dyes were investigated by UV-Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopy in dichloromethane solution and after grafting on 2 μm-thick transparent TiO2 films. The absorption and emission spectra are shown in Fig. 2 and the corresponding data are tabulated in Table 1.

In solution, the PK dyes exhibit three prominent peaks. The ones located between 300–310 nm and 369–395 nm correspond to π–π* transitions whereas the visible ones between 529 and 543 nm originate from an internal charge transfer (ICT) absorption. The ICT bands show rather good molar extinction coefficients comprised between 29700 and 45500 M−1 cm−1.

PK1, which can be considered as our reference compound in this study, shows a λmax for the ICT band at 534 nm in solution whereas the one of PK2 is blue-shifted by 7 nm. This result is expected since the introduction of branched chains onto oligothiophenes is known to increase the torsion angle between adjacent thiophenes, thus decreasing the planarity and the π-conjugation of the dye.30
This phenomenon was already observed in branched-type organic dyes with a twisted architecture31 or dyes bearing bulky substituents14 and Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations that have been employed to examine the most stable conformations for molecules confirm this observation (see ESI†).

PK3 also shows a blue-shift of 7 nm but this effect is now concomitant with a strong decrease by circa 16000 M−1 cm−1 of its molar extinction coefficient at the maximum absorption wavelength compared to PK1. A slight increase of the twist angle between the phenyl ring or the TPA unit and the connected thiophene bearing an octyl group can explain this observation. It should be noted that some dihedral angles between the various aromatic rings in the PK3 structure have increased compared to PK1 as demonstrated by DFT (see ESI†). The last dye, 6PK1, revealed a bathochromic shift of circa 7 nm of its π–π* transition and ICT bands compared with PK1 due to the slightly stronger donor character of the TPA bearing two hexyl chains.
The absorption and emission spectra of the dyes were recorded after grafting on 2 μm-thick transparent TiO2 films together with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as the co-adsorbent to perfectly mimic the real conditions of use. The four dyes show a blue-shift of their ICT band ranging from 2 nm to 19 nm on TiO2 compared to solutions. Slight hypsochromic shifts can usually be ascribed to deprotonation of the carboxylic acid32 but larger ones could be attributed to the formation of H-aggregates of dyes according to Kasha's exciton theory.33 It should also be noted that such aggregates can lead to the quenching of the excited state of the dyes and decrease their photoluminescence properties.34,35
If we compare the intensity of the absorption and emission spectra of the different dyes on TiO2 films with identical thicknesses, one can conclude that PK1 is the dye that is the most adsorbed on the oxide and that it has a strong tendency to form aggregates as it is confirmed by its high absorption and low photoluminescence on TiO2 compared to solution. PK2 and PK3 that are sterically hindered on their lateral position show lower absorption intensities than PK1 indicating that a lower number of molecules are attached to their surfaces. Finally, 6PK1 shows the lowest adsorption suggesting that the alkyl chains of the TPA have a negative influence on the dye loading. All these observations were consistent with the dye-loading measurements on the TiO2 electrodes (13 + 4 μm) used in test cells (Table 2). Finally, by measuring the photoluminescence quantum yields of the different compounds, we found that among the four dyes, PK2 shows the highest values both in solution and in the solid state. This observation is clear evidence that this dye, bearing more bulky lateral groups, has the lowest propensity to form aggregates even in the solid phase.

The electrochemical properties of the dyes were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) in dichloromethane (see ESI†) in order to determine the energy level positions of their frontier orbitals. PK1, PK2 and PK3 show similar oxidation potentials at 0.58–0.59 V vs. the NHE while the 6PK1 oxidation potential is found at a lower value of 0.46 V due to the higher electron-donating character of the substituted TPA compared to other dyes. The oxidation potentials of the four PK dyes are sufficiently high to use iodide/triiodide as a redox couple in the electrolyte whose potential is located at 0.35 V vs. the NHE.36 The reduction potentials were comprised between −1.00 and −1.07 V vs. the NHE. Thus, this position warrants a sufficient driving force for electron injection from the dye to the conduction band of TiO2 which is located around −0.5 V vs. the NHE.37
The calculated molecular orbital energy diagrams for the most stable conformations of PK dyes, along with isodensity plots of the HOMO and LUMO, are given in the ESI.† The dyes show a directional electron distribution, where the HOMO is preferentially localized on the triphenylamine group and the adjacent bithiophene unit whereas the LUMO is predominantly delocalized on the BTD-bithiophene-phenylvinylcyanoacetic units. This directional electron distribution is desired and should facilitate the reduction of the oxidized dyes by the electrolyte and the injection of electrons in TiO2 (see ESI†).
Photovoltaic properties
We performed photovoltaic characterization of DSSC devices based on the PK dyes. For an accurate and reliable comparison, solar cells for each dye were fabricated and characterized under exactly the same conditions at the ICIQ. The devices were fabricated using screen printed TiO2 films (Dyesol paste) as the working electrode and platinized FTO glass as the counter electrode. The electrolyte used for the fabrication of the high performance testing devices was a liquid electrolyte (namely HI30 from Solaronix) consisting of 0.5 M 1,3-dimethyl-imidazolium iodide (DMII), 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.03 M iodine, 0.5 M tert-butyl-pyridine and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate in pure acetonitrile. For the fabrication of the stable devices, an ionic liquid-based electrolyte was employed (Mosalyte TDE-250 from Solaronix). This non-volatile electrolyte contains a mixture of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetracyanoborate, n-butyl benzimidazole, iodine and guanidium thiocyanate. All solar cells were fabricated with the same photoelectrode composition consisting of a 13 μm-thick colloidal paste layer and a 4 μm-thick scattering layer. The dyeing process was carried out with a mixture of CHCl3 that dissolves well the dyes and EtOH to dissolve chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) (see ESI†). The use of CDCA with organic sensitizers is known on one hand to reduce the sensitizer's loading and on the other hand it is known to decrease the undesirable formation of dye aggregates on the surface and to decrease recombination processes between TiO2 electrons and electrolyte species.38 With the goal to find the best compromise between these antagonist effects, the amount of CDCA added during the sensitization was varied from 0 to 10 mM for two of the dyes (PK1 and PK2, see ESI†). We found that the use of CDCA is mandatory in our case to achieve good performances since in the absence of CDCA the Jsc and the Voc are lowered leading to poor performances. However we found that a ratio of 0.2 mM/2 mM (dye/CDA) is sufficient to obtain high performances, the benefit of increasing the ratio of CDCA up to 10 mM is minor and it is mostly related to the increase of the Voc (see ESI†).
In order to further prove the reproducibility of our results, three optimised solar cells for each dye were fabricated and characterized under exactly the same conditions at Solaronix. The devices were fabricated using screen printed TiO2 films (Solaronix paste) and the same liquid electrolyte as previously mentioned was used. The active area in this case was increased to 0.36 cm2.
The J–V curves of the best performing cells recorded under standard AM 1.5 G full sunlight conditions are given in Fig. 3. Their selected photovoltaic parameters, i.e. short circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and the power conversion efficiency (PCE), are summarized in Table 2.
 Fig. 3  
J–V (left) and IPCE (right) curves of HI-30 liquid electrolyte based DSSCs using optimized parameters. 
From these results it appears clearly that the photovoltaic performances of the four dyes are significantly different despite the fact that they possess exactly the same π-conjugated backbone. It is important to mention that the same trends are observed for the devices fabricated independently at the ICIQ and Solaronix. Among the dyes, PK2 leads to the highest power conversion efficiency of 9.05% associated with a good Jsc of 18.08 mA cm−2, a Voc of 704 mV, and a FF of 71%. The devices comprising PK1, 6PK1 and PK3 sensitizers showed much lower PCE values of 7.20%, 6.91% and 6.53% respectively. With these dyes, we observed a dramatic drop of Jsc that ranges from 13.79 mA cm−2 to 14.77 mA cm−2. The Voc of these solar cells also decreases below 700 mV whereas the FF is not impacted with values around 71–73%.
In order to gain insight into the differences between devices in terms of Jsc, the IPCE curves were measured and are presented in Fig. 3.
All the IPCE curves reveal a similar shape but there are some variations in their intensities. PK2 clearly outperforms the other dyes with a maximum IPCE above 80% between 490 and 640 nm while PK1, 6PK1 and PK3 show a maximum IPCE between 65% and 75% in the same range of wavelengths.
If we compare PK1 and PK2, that are isomeric compounds, the higher Jsc and IPCE response of PK2 can be explained by the presence of the branched alkyl chains that reduces the formation of undesirable aggregates and the packing of the dyes during the dyeing process. Indeed these two dyes show higher values of dye-loading on the electrodes (6.17 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for PK1 and 5.08 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for PK2) and they possess a similar range of absorption. However PK1, as discussed before, has a strong tendency to aggregate and this phenomenon is known to induce a photocurrent loss because of the intermolecular energy transfer that occurs between densely packed molecules causing excited-state quenching of the dyes.39,40

PK3 and 6PK1 that are bearing a higher number of alkyl substituents showed lower rates of dye-loading on the electrodes compared to PK2. The volume of the dyes is higher in this case and it diminishes the number of molecules that can be attached to the surface. This could explain the lower current densities and IPCE maxima achieved with these dyes.
For a better understanding of the device operation and the differences between sensitizers, charge extraction (CE) and transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements were carried out (see Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Charge extraction (left) and transient photovoltage (right) measurements of liquid electrolyte based DSSCs using optimized parameters. 
The charge extraction data show a similar charge density (defined as the number of charges stored in the solar cell at each different voltage) for all the devices. In contrast, some differences appear in the TPV curves. The TPV experiments reflect that the electron lifetimes are quite similar for PK1 and PK2. Consistent with previous studies, for 6PK1, the electron lifetime is slightly longer; indeed, when long aliphatic chains or alkoxy groups are introduced on the TPA unit, the electron lifetime is increased.41–43
It is interesting to note that the highest Voc values are achieved with PK1, PK2 and 6PK1, i.e. the dyes with a prolonged lifetime for electrons stored in titania. This trend is normal since the Voc of a DSSC is determined by the quasi-Fermi-level of the metal oxide (correlated with its conduction band edge) that is itself dependent on the electron density and the rate of recombination between semiconductor electrons and oxidized electrolyte species.43PK3 reveals a lower electron lifetime and this can explain the lower Voc value of 649 mV measured for the corresponding solar cells and their lower performances. This result is fully consistent with previous observations where the electron lifetime is found greatly reduced at reduced dye loading.44,45 We confirm here that the dyes showing the highest loads on the electrode are more likely to create a surface blocking layer and hence the electron lifetime is improved.
After demonstrating that it is possible to improve significantly the performances of solar cells up to 9.05% simply by engineering the solubilizing groups of the sensitizer, it was appealing to develop more stable devices by swapping the solvent electrolyte with an ionic liquid electrolyte.
For all the dyes combined with ionic liquid electrolytes a decrease of PCE is observed. This drop of the PCE is related to the decrease of the Jsc, explained by the lower ion diffusivity in ionic liquids compared to that in solvents.46
Once again PK2 demonstrates the highest performance with a Jsc of 16.16 mA cm2, a Voc of 704 mV, and a FF of 69% leading to a maximum PCE of 7.81%. This performance is significantly better than the one of the other dyes comprised between 4.23% and 5.89%. In consideration of this result with a broader context, the performance of PK2 is markedly better than most of the performances using purely ionic liquid based electrolytes with I−/I3− as a redox shuttle that are reported for organic or ruthenium-based sensitizers.26,47,48
In order to evaluate the stability of DSSCs containing our dyes we have prepared a series of devices with Mosalyte TDE-250 as the electrolyte and subjected them to the ISOS-L2 standard ageing test (see ESI†). This test consists in continuous irradiation in a solar simulator with a light intensity of 1000 W cm−2 at 65 °C with ambient relative humidity.49 In this experiment the cells were protected with a UV absorbing polymer film. For real applications of DSSCs, particularly in BIPV, it is mandatory to evaluate the evolution of the photovoltaic parameters of a cell over a long period (at least 2000 h) since it is difficult to extrapolate the long-term stability behaviour when the cells are irradiated during shorter periods. In Fig. 5, the evolution of the normalized PCE measured at different time intervals under the irradiance of AM 1.5 G is shown.
 Fig. 5  TDE-250 ionic electrolyte based DSSCs under irradiation of 1000 W m−2 at 65 °C. 
After 24 to 72 h under these conditions, the Jsc and PCE of some of the solar cells increase. This tendency is frequently observed with viscous ionic liquids and it is related to the slow penetration of the electrolyte through the mesoporous film leading to the ‘‘activation’’ of the electrode in depth.14,50
Such behaviour is observed with PK1 and PK2 over the first 100 hours and on a shorter period with 6PK1. In the case of PK3, this effect is probably masked by a concomitant degradation process. From the curve recorded over a period of 2000 h it appears clearly that the dyes split into two categories: the stable ones where cells retain between 20% and 30% of their initial performances and the non-stable ones where efficiency drops by circa 70% under the same period. It is interesting to note that the solar cells based on the dyes that contain a higher number of alkyl chains seem to undergo a faster and a more intense degradation.
We believe that our study is the first work showing that alkyl chain substitution on organic dyes has an impact on the stability of the final devices. Indeed the solar cells sensitized with PK3 and 6PK1, which comprise respectively three and four alkyl chains in their chemical structures, are poorly stable. This phenomenon is not yet fully understood but several plausible hypotheses can be drawn such as degradation of the conjugated core of the molecules through side-chain oxidation and sulfoxide formation,51 or the hydrolytic cleavage process of the anchoring group.52,53 Further experiments and investigations would be necessary to shed light on the complete degradation mechanisms of solar cells fabricated with PK dyes; however this study is beyond the scope of this paper.
To finish, we have investigated the degradation of the best solar cells sensitized with PK1 and PK2 for a longer period in order to determine the time of operation until the loss of 40% of the initial performance. We found that PK2 cells remain the most stable after a prolonged period in the ageing chamber and interestingly they keep 60% of their initial performances after 7300 h. This result is quite encouraging and demonstrates that alkyl chain engineering in organic dyes could be a valuable strategy to increase not only the performances but also the lifetimes of DSSC devices.
Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized and characterized a series of four organic dyes in view of their application as sensitizers in DSSCs. The dyes own a perfectly identical π-conjugated system and only differ in the number or the nature of the alkyl groups (linear or ramified) attached to this backbone as solubilizing substituents. With the goal to unravel the effect of solubilizing groups on the performances and the stability of dye sensitized solar cells, we have prepared and characterized DSSCs with iodine based liquid or ionic liquid electrolytes and we have studied their operating mode.
All the dyes show quite similar optoelectronic properties but rather different behaviours in terms of aggregation and dye loading on the mesoporous electrodes. Devices fabricated and tested under exactly identical conditions demonstrate that simple modifications of the solubilizing groups of the dyes have a significant impact on the photovoltaic performances and that bulky substituents can help improving the PCE from 6.53% to 9.05% when a liquid electrolyte is employed. The same observation applies for solar cells comprising an ionic liquid electrolyte. In this case the best devices demonstrated PCEs up to 7.81% and revealed a quite high stability of the performances under accelerated ageing after 7300 h of light-soaking. Unexpectedly, we also demonstrate that the number and the type of solubilizing groups attached on the π-conjugated backbone of the dyes have a strong influence on the lifetimes of the devices; i.e. the dyes that contain lower ratios of alkyl groups lead to the more stable cells.
To conclude we highlight in this work the underestimated role of alkyl substituents, usually employed as solubilizing groups for organic sensitizers, in the performances and the stability of the devices. This work paves the way to new research studies and strategies of chemical engineering of organic dyes to improve simultaneously efficiency and stability.
