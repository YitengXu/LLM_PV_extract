This study will facilitate the development of smart materials with modulated handedness in materials science.
Supramolecular chirality is one of the most fascinating examples of chiral structures and is commonly found in biological systems1 and artificial molecules.2 At present, chiral supramolecular helix nanostructures have been attracting increasing attention because of their intrinsic dynamic nature and crucial applications in chiral sensing or recognition,3,4 asymmetric catalysis,5,6 and chiroptical switching.7–9 Studies on helical chirality have revealed various interesting phenomena, and helicity inversion is one of the most fascinating and distinctive features of dynamic helical nanostructures. In this context, numerous excellent studies have shown that helical handedness of self-assembled nanostructures from synthetic oligomers and polymers can be successfully achieved by covalently linking chiral groups10–14 or applying external stimuli, such as solvents,7 temperature,2 light,15 and metal ions.16,17 However, controlling helical chirality or helicity inversion in supramolecular nanostructures as triggered by achiral substituents is difficult due to complicated multiple non-covalent interactions.18,19 Switchable helical materials are ideal candidates in optical devices, such as sensors, switches, and memory systems toward chemical and physical stimuli; thus, exploring the chirality transformation initiated by achiral factors is important to identify the mechanism of chirality conversion from the molecular scale to the supramolecular level in self-assembled systems.
Fused aromatic compounds involving extended π-conjugated systems have been a subject of significant research interest owing to their utility as organic semiconductors for various electronic applications.20–22 Among them, fused and extended aromatic compounds incorporated with chalcogen atoms are of interest because these atoms play important roles in determining intermolecular interactions, energy levels, and morphology of solid-state materials to attain excellent device performance.23–25 Wang et al. achieved a high-power conversion efficiency from 7.16% to 8.4% by switching sulfur to selenium in bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells.23,24 Yasuda et al. reported that thin-film organic field-effect transistors based on picene showed a high carrier mobility of up to 4.7 cm2 V−1 s−1 upon incorporation of a central chalcogen atom.25 Despite this unique versatility based on chalcogen atom substitution, little attention has been paid to the influence of chalcogen atoms on the supramolecular chirality of fused aromatic π-systems, presumably due to the synthetic challenges involved in incorporating chalcogen atoms into chiral π-conjugated systems. Chalcogen atoms can modulate intermolecular interactions; thus, introducing chalcogen atoms can potentially bias dynamic self-assembly to drive addressable conformational switching from one helix sense to the other.
Perylene diimides (PDIs) exhibit desirable optoelectronic properties and are important building blocks in the realm of functional materials.26–28 We have previously shown that using covalently linked alkyl chains, bay-substituted groups, and solvent mixtures yielded either left- or right-handed helical nanostructures.7–9,28 In this study, we present an unexpected helicity inversion by incorporating chalcogen atoms (S and Se) into a perylene core (Scheme 1). By combining density functional theory (DFT) calculations with experimental investigations, we propose that chalcogen atom-mediated van der Waals interactions play key roles in tuning these perylene helical aggregations. These modulated supramolecular interactions were transferred to nanostructures and observed in the response of vapor-sensing devices. This study elaborates the route for modulating helical chirality in supramolecular nanostructures triggered by achiral substituents and for constructing high-performance gas sensing devices.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structure of compounds PDI, PDIS and PDISe. 

PDI, PDIS, and PDISe were synthesized and characterized according to the procedure in the ESI.†14,23,24 To discuss the structure-dependent chirality variation, we first considered the solution-state characteristics. Fig. 1a shows that the UV–vis absorption spectra of PDI in dilute chloroform (0.05 mg mL−1) show absorptions in the wavelength range of 430–550 nm with a maximum absorbance peak at 530 nm. This is a typical spectrum of individual perylene molecules in the solution (i.e., in a non-aggregated form).9,10,36 In contrast, blue-shifted and narrower absorption spectra throughout the 400–530 nm range with maximum absorption peaks at 505 and 515 nm were observed for PDIS and PDISe in chloroform (Fig. 1a), respectively. This behavior originated from the formation of S and Se bridges in the bay region, which increased the electron density and steric hindrance of the perylene subunits and thus weakened the π-conjugation between the perylene skeleton, ultimately leading to the blue-shifted and narrower absorption spectra in PDIS and PDISe compared to that in PDI.23,24 Moreover, the substitution of sulfur with selenium atoms entailed a red shift of the maximum absorption band due to an increase in the atomic size of sulfur (1.02 Å) and selenium (1.16 Å) and the weakness of the C–X bond on going from C–S to C–Se.30 Accordingly, no obvious Cotton effect in the circular dichroism (CD) spectra was observed in the chloroform solution (Fig. 1c) due to the lack of perylene aggregation, and this finding fits well with the absorption spectra.
 Fig. 1  (a and b) UV–vis and (c and d) CD spectra in (a and c) chloroform and (b and d) chloroform/methanol (2:3, V/V, 0.05 mg mL−1) for compounds PDI, PDIS and PDISe. 
However, when 60 vol% methanol was gradually added to the chloroform solution, the intensity ratios of the absorption peaks at 490, 470, and 480 nm to those at 560, 500, and 510 nm were dramatically increased for PDI, PDIS, and PDISe, respectively. Moreover, new peaks at approximately 556, 532, and 538 nm were observed for PDI, PDIS, and PDISe (Fig. 1b). This pronounced absorption band at longer wavelengths is typically a sign of π–π interactions in molecular stacking.29 The maximum absorption peak was found at 538 nm for PDIS among these PDIs, thus implying effective π–π interactions in PDIS aggregates. Accompanied by the addition of methanol into chloroform, intense Cotton effects were observed for PDI, PDIS, and PDISe molecules in chloroform (40 vol%)–methanol (60 vol%) mixed solutions. Fig. 1d shows that the CD spectrum of PDI shifted from positive to negative and then to positive Cotton peaks at 380, 440 and 550 nm (crossover at 420 and 480 nm). The CD signal indicated a chiral excitonic coupling that arises when chromophores are aggregated with their transition dipoles oriented in a helical fashion.4,5 The variation from positive to negative and then to positive Cotton effect suggested the formation of helical aggregates in the chloroform–methanol mixed solutions for PDI molecules.27 In sharp contrast, a positive Cotton peak at ca. 430 nm and a negative one at ca. 520 nm (crossover at 480 nm) were revealed for PDIS (Fig. 1d). The bisignate signal, as characterized by a change from positive to negative with increasing wavelength, suggested a left-handed helical arrangement of the transition dipoles for PDIS aggregations.29PDISe aggregation exhibited an opposite behavior in terms of chirality, and the negative/positive CD peaks at 430 and 530 nm (crossover at 480 nm) were found in chloroform–methanol mixed solutions. Comparing PDISe with PDIS, only the core-incorporated atom changed, and this finding suggested the achievement of a unique core-substituted chalcogen atom-dependent chiroptical inversion effect.
A significant difference was observed in the aggregated morphologies of PDI, PDIS, and PDISe in chloroform–methanol mixed solutions. Samples for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigations were prepared by dropping PDI, PDIS, and PDISe nanostructures on the silicon slice, followed by evaporation of the solvent in air at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 2a, left-handed (M-type) planar ribbons with a diameter of ca. 300 nm were found in the PDI sample, thus implying that the PDI molecules may be highly inclined to aggregate in a M-helicity manner in chloroform–methanol mixed solutions. Similar to those of PDI, left-handed ribbons with a smaller diameter of ca. 200 nm were observed in the PDIS sample (Fig. 2b), which coincided with the CD spectrum (Fig. 1d).
 Fig. 2  SEM images of (a) PDI, (b) PDIS and (c) PDISe nanostructures obtained from chloroform/methanol (2:3, V/V, 0.05 mg mL−1). 
By contrast, the nanostructures obtained from the PDISe solution exhibited right-handed (P-type) line morphologies with an average diameter of approximately 100 nm, and this finding agreed with the CD spectrum (Fig. 1d). These results further confirmed that the supramolecular helical chirality of perylene dyes with opposite handedness was well achieved from chiral monomers with the same configurational chirality by exchanging achiral chalcogen atoms (S and Se).
To gain deep insight into the origin and mechanism of the helix inversion, we needed to examine the effect of achiral chalcogen atoms on the inversion of helical sense. Theoretical calculation was conducted by using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level to investigate the thermodynamic process of such chiral architectures. Due to the steric hindrance of the chalcogen atoms and chiral alkyl chains, the adjacent molecules should rotate at a certain angle to reach the conformation with minimal system energy. Most energetically preferable molecules are coaxially arranged, and thus the energy dependence on the rotation angle was calculated and is presented in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Simulations to investigate the energy dependence on rotation of the PDI, PDIS and PDISe upper molecules in a stacked dimer. The binding energy equals the total energy of the dimer minus the energy of the two separate molecules. 
As shown in Fig. 3, the binding energy of the PDI, PDIS, and PDISe dimer changes as the upper molecule rotates gradually, with the rotation angle changing from 0° to 90° (right-handed)/from 0° to −90° (left-handed). Detailed analysis revealed that the molecules of PDI and PDIS had negative rotation angles of −26° (1.28 kJ mol−1) and −18° (−9.62 kJ mol−1); however, PDISe, which had a positive rotation angle of 41° (−9.41 kJ mol−1), showed a lower binding energy, indicating that this structure was the most stable one. Negative rotation angles implied that PDI and PDIS showed thermodynamically preferred left-handed helical aggregated states, whereas the positive rotation angle suggested that PDISe showed a thermodynamically preferred right-handed helical aggregated state.29 This finding provided a theoretical basis for our experimental observations of the left-handed helical fibers for PDI and PDIS and the right-handed helical wires for PDISe in the CD spectra and SEM images. The binding energies of 6.78 kJ, 2.81 kJ, and 17.29 kJ mol−1 at rotation angles of 36°, 35°, and −50° for PDI, PDIS, and PDISe, respectively, were revealed, and the system had a low-stability local minimum with a high positive binding energy. Compared with PDIS and PDISe, the energy difference in the right- and left-handed states was smaller for PDI, thus implying that the right-handed aggregation may occur kinetically, and coincide well with the CD determination in the chloroform–methanol mixed solution.
The weak interaction within the dimers of PDI, PDIS and PDISe was investigated by the independent gradient model (IGM) analysis,31 which was performed using Multiwfn 3.6.32 As shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI,† a chalcogen–chalcogen distance and Lewis base angles of 3.38 Å and 101.5° for PDIS dimers, and 3.46 Å and 100.2° for PDISe dimers were respectively revealed. This distance is below the sum of the van der Waals radii of S (3.60 Å) and Se (3.80 Å). However, the Lewis base angle of 101.5° for PDIS and 100.2° for PDISe dimers, which is far from 180°, presents convincing evidence for the absence of chalcogen bonding interactions in PDIS and PDISe dimers.33
The isosurface of the weak interaction visualized using the VMD software is shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI.†34 The green isosurface indicated that the van der Waals interaction was formed. We implemented an atom pair index to quantify the contribution of an atom pair to intermolecular interaction and found that the dominating contribution to the van der Waals interaction between PDIS dimers was the S⋯S interactions. By sharp comparison, the contribution of Se⋯Se interactions to the van der Waals interaction substantially weakened accompanied by the enhancement of the C–Se⋯π-system interactions for PDISe dimers. It is proposed that chalcogen atom-mediated van der Waals interactions as the main driving force resulted in the left-handed helical nanofibers for PDIS and right-handed helical nanowires for PDISe. Furthermore, a stacking distance of 3.35 Å for PDIS dimers was revealed and it is significantly less than 3.42 Å for PDISe dimers, implying stronger van der Waals interactions in PDIS dimers. The stronger van der Waals interactions may originate from the S⋯S interactions and play a critical role in determining the excellent gas response of the PDIS device.
As an n-type organic semiconductor material (i.e., electron acceptor), perylene can act as a sensing material for detecting reducing agents (i.e., electron donors), such as ammonia.26,28 Therefore, the gas response (i.e., the normalized change in the electrical current I/I0, where I and I0 denote the real-time and the initial current in the gas, respectively) of PDI, PDIS, and PDISe to saturated ammonia (100 ppm) was investigated using two-probe devices (inset image in Fig. 4a). Fig. 4 shows increased magnitudes of ca. 220, 340, and 115 in PDI, PDIS, and PDISe devices in ammonia, implying that PDIS possessed the best gas response, and its magnitude was 1.5 and 3 times those of PDI and PDISe, respectively. The large electrical modulation observed was largely due to the electron donation from ammonia via electron donor–acceptor complexation towards perylene, followed by efficient long-range electron transport via π–π delocalization and ultimately led to current changes (Fig. 4b).35,36 The π–π overlap of vicinal perylene molecules significantly affected electron transport mobility, and evidence suggested that charge carrier mobility was maximized along the direction of cofacial π–π stacking of perylene.8,12,13 As revealed in the perylene dimer via DFT calculation, PDIS molecules possessed a smaller rotation angle (−18°) between the vicinal perylene skeleton at the energetically preferred state than PDI and PDISe. The small rotation angle implied a large π–π overlap of the vicinal PDIS core that was expected to enhance electron mobility and lead to the most dramatic improvement in the current. Large rotation angles for PDI (−26°) and PDISe (41°) will reduce the π–π overlap of the vicinal perylene core and weaken the electron transport mobility and ultimately decrease the currents of PDI and PDIS by approximately 1.5 and 3 times compared with PDIS. Moreover, the smaller interplanar spacing of 3.35 Å (Fig. S1, ESI†) between the vicinal PDIS core compared with those of PDI (3.37 Å, Fig. S1, ESI†) and PDISe (3.42 Å, Fig. S1, ESI†) contributed to the high-performance transport of electrons and assisted with a highly remarkable increment in the electrical current of the PDIS device.

In summary, we modulated van der Waals interactions to further adjust the supramolecular helicity by incorporating S and Se into the bay region. These modulated supramolecular interactions were transferred to nanostructures and played critical roles in the gas response of devices. This work will facilitate the development of smart materials with controllable handedness based on chalcogen atom-dependent supramolecular interactions.
