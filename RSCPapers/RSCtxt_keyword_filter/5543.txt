    , Accepted 20th June 2019First published on 20th June 2019Abstract2,2′-Dipyridylamines (dpa) and related compounds belong to the family of polydentate nitrogen ligands. More than a century has passed since their first report but new complexes and applications have been emerging in recent years owing to the versatility of dpa-based architectures. This review aims to present and highlight the main achievements attained with dpa-containing metal complexes in the domains of homogeneous catalysis and luminescent materials.
1. Introduction
Chelating ligands play a pivotal role in coordination and organometallic chemistry with multiple applications in various domains. Beyond the ubiquitous bis-pyridine,1 bis-imine and related ligands,2 bis-oxazoline3 and NacNac4 ligands (β-diketiminate) and 2,2′-dipyridylamine (dpa)-based ligands have been much less explored. The first report of dpa synthesis using sodium amide goes back to 1914,5 but it is only in the second half of the 20th century that this class of compounds was more actively investigated, in particular in coordination chemistry owing to the multiple coordination modes they allow.6 Surprisingly, despite the rapid growth of N,N-chelating ligands in catalysis and materials sciences, it is only recently that dpa ligands have attracted increasing interest in these domains. The facilitated synthesis of dpa-derivatives through Pd-catalysed amination reactions7 and the modularity of this ligand undoubtedly contributed to their increasing interest (Fig. 1). The present review aims to present the recent developments and applications of organometallic complexes incorporating dipyridylamine ligands L1 in catalysis and materials sciences with an emphasis on luminescent materials. When possible, complexes coordinated to the well-known bipyridine, bpy-L2, or 1,10-phenanthroline, phen-L3, ligands will be compared to highlight the differences between these three classes of ligands (Fig. 1).

2. Homogeneous catalysis
2.1 Reduction reactions
Reduction and oxidation reactions are major transformations in organic chemistry and industrial processes. Recently, these reactions have received renewed interest with the growing development of sustainable resources and energies.8
In 1999, the electroreductive coupling of aromatic halides was reported in ethanol using a catalyst in situ generated from NiBr2, 3H2O and dpa L1.9 A number of biaryl compounds were obtained in yields higher than those obtained when the catalyst was prepared with 2,2′-bipyridine (bpy) L2 as a ligand. In particular, several compounds not accessible with NiBr2(L2) were synthesized in modest to good yields with NiBr2(L1) (Scheme 1, a). Similarly, the same catalyst was utilized for the conjugate addition of arylbromides on activated olefins in ethanol (Scheme 1, b).

Another example of electrocatalytic reduction was reported in 2009 by Wong.10 A pyrrole-tagged dpa ligand L4 was reacted with a rhenium precursor leading to the Re(I) complex C1 shown in Fig. 2. This monomer was easily electropolymerized onto a glassy carbon electrode in acetonitrile. This electrode was found to be active for the electroreduction of CO2 to CO as demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry measurements performed under an argon atmosphere and under a CO2 atmosphere.

More recently, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 was investigated with metal carbonyl complexes of tungsten and molybdenum bearing bipyridine and dpa ligands (Fig. 3).11 Interestingly, catalyst C2 outperformed the bpy-based catalyst C3 in the preparative scale reduction of CO2 into CO. Mechanistic investigation also revealed a major difference between the bpy- and dpa-based catalysts. Indeed, contrary to the bpy-ligand, experimental and theoretical results suggested a non-innocent behaviour of the dpa ligand with CO formation mainly localized on the dpa-ligand rather than on the metal centre.

The imidazolium-tagged dpa ligand L6 was easily prepared and used as a stabiliser of Pd nanoparticles for hydrogenation of olefins under biphasic conditions (Fig. 4).12 The Pd nanoparticles were easily in situ prepared by mixing Pd(OAc)2, the tagged-dpa ligand L6 and an ionic liquid in acetone followed by reduction of Pd(II) with dihydrogen. This catalyst could perform quantitatively the hydrogenation of cyclohexene, styrene and ethyl acrylate at 35 °C under 1 bar of dihydrogen pressure. After separation, the catalyst was reused two times without a decrease in the yield. Water compatibility is also accessible using ionic complexes. In 2010, a series of cationic ruthenium complexes were prepared and implemented in the aqueous phase transfer hydrogenation of ketones (Fig. 5).13

Several ketones were efficiently reduced at 65 °C in water with C6 and HCO2H/HCOONa (Fig. 6). The recyclability of the catalyst was investigated showing a rapid decrease of conversion after the second run.

Simultaneously, Pandey and coworkers reported the synthesis and characterization of a series of cationic Ru-dpa complexes with various coordination spheres consisting of 2,2′-dipyridylamine L1 or di-2-pyridylbenzylamine (dpb) L7, p-cymene and benzene as arenes, Cl, N3, CN, and SCN as X ligands and PF6 or BF4 as counter-ions (Fig. 7).14 The chloro-complexes were evaluated in the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone and benzophenone at 82 °C using isopropanol as the hydrogen source. As generally observed with ruthenium complexes in catalysis, the η6-p-cymene complex displayed better performances than the η6-benzene derivative.

The groups of Salmain and Renaud reported a series of studies in bioinorganic chemistry involving organometallic complexes incorporating dpa ligands. The structural modularity of the ligand was first used for the synthesis of ruthenium complexes C12–C14 bearing a thiol-reactive maleimide function aimed at inactivating the cysteine endoproteinase papain by S-alkylation of the cysteine active site (Fig. 8).15 These complexes and related rhodium complexes were later evaluated in the catalytic reduction of NAD+ into NADH.16 The results demonstrated the great superiority of Rh vs. Ru and revealed that catalysts bearing the N-alkylated dpa ligands were not as efficient as bispyridine or phenanthroline-derived complexes of different structures.
 Fig. 8  Complexes used in the reduction of NAD+ using sodium formate as the hydride source. 
The modularity of the dpa ligand was further extended to the synthesis of artificial metalloenzymes derived from bovine β-lactoglobulin.17 A series of complexes bearing a dpa ligand N-alkylated with saturated and unsaturated fatty acids was prepared and characterized (Fig. 9). These complexes were initially evaluated in the transfer hydrogenation of trifluoroacetophenone (TFACP) where rhodium catalysts yet surpassed their ruthenium analogs. The supramolecular assembling of these complexes within β-lactoglobulin was realised in EtOH or DMSO at pH 7.5 and the association was evidenced by circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopy. The resulting supramolecular catalysts were evaluated in the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation of trifluoroacetophenone with formate. Most complexes retained their original activity but the enantiomeric excess reached a low maximum value of 32% for the (R)-enantiomer.

The potential of dpa ligands in transition metal-catalyzed reduction was extended to the valorization of bio-sourced compounds such as levulinic acid. A series of dpa-based ruthenium and iridium complexes was evaluated in the transfer hydrogenation and hydrogenation of levulinic acid (Fig. 10).18 In the M–Cl series, transfer hydrogenation was performed under neat conditions in the presence of triethylamine. Both ruthenium and iridium complexes were shown to be competent for this transformation but iridium catalysts, in particular C19, were slightly more efficient as they could perform the reduction of levulinic acid at 120 °C when a temperature of 150 °C was necessary with the most efficient ruthenium catalyst C18. Nevertheless, recycling of the ruthenium catalyst C18 was achieved in six consecutive cycles without loss of activity. Much better results were obtained with zwitterionic complexes C22–C27 bearing an OSO3− ligand (Fig. 10).19 In particular, iridium catalyst C25 displayed high performances in aqueous phase transfer hydrogenation using formic acid (TON 9000) and more significantly in hydrogenation under 5 bar of hydrogen pressure at 130 °C, for which the highest TON was reported (TON 174000). Of note, it was demonstrated that transfer hydrogenation proceeded essentially by hydrogenation resulting from fast and efficient dehydrogenation of formic acid into CO2 and H2.

The zwitterionic iridium-complex C25 was further engaged in the reductive amination of levulinic acid into pyrrolidone derivatives (Scheme 2).20 A broad range of pyrrolidone derivatives was efficiently synthesized from aliphatic and aromatic amines. In particular, sterically hindered amines could be employed leading to new bulky derivatives as shown in Fig. 11. Isoindolinone derivatives were also efficiently prepared by reductive amination of 2-formylbenzoic acid. Here too bulky derivatives including new compounds were prepared in high yields (Fig. 11).

The hydrogenation of another biosourced compound, namely 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), into 1-hydroxyhexane-2,5-dione (HHD) was reported by de Vries (Fig. 12).21 Among the five catalysts evaluated, the iridium-dpa C19 furnished the highest yield of 76%. Notably, the well-known and efficient Ru-pincer catalyst C28 led to high conversion but poor selectivity for the desired product isolated in only 5%.

2.2 Oxidation reactions
Besides reduction reactions, oxidation transformations involving dpa-ligands have received less attention. Early reports made use of dpa and dpa derivatives in ligand screening. In 1995, Griffith reported a study on the ruthenium- and osmium-catalysed oxidation of alkenes, alkanes and alcohols.22 Catalysts in situ generated from RuCl3 and various bidentate N,N-ligands were evaluated in the epoxidation of cyclooctene using NaIO4 as the oxidant. A modest 50% yield was obtained with RuCl3-dpa when 72% yield was obtained with RuCl3-bpy. Dpa ligands were implemented in the synthesis of supramolecular polynuclear metal catalysts for oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol (DTBC).23 In an example, the copper-catalyzed oxidation of DTBC under a pure oxygen atmosphere was performed at 25 °C. All the dpa-based catalysts displayed moderate conversion of ca. 45–50% with selectivities for 3,5-di-tert-butylbenzoquinone higher than 90%. In another example, eight dpa ligands were anchored onto a silsesquioxane cage.24 Three of these dpa ligands could be coordinated to a molybdenum species leading to a silsesquioxane “T8-dpa-[Mo(η3-C3H5)Br(CO)2]” supramolecular architecture. This compound was fully characterized and evaluated in the epoxidation of styrene and cyclooctene using tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) as the oxidant, but it exhibited low reactivity. In another study, [Cu(II)(dpa)(H2O)3]2+ was advantageously used for the selective delignification of oxygen-prebleached Kraft pulp (OPK) using H2O2.25 When compared to ligand-free CuCl2 bleaching, the Cu(II)(dpa) catalyst led to a 12-fold increase of the delignification selectivity. This improvement was assumed to result from the measured decrease of the hydroxyl radical in the reaction catalysed by Cu(II)(dpa) as compared to CuCl2.
In 2004, Bolm reported a study aimed at using dpa-ligands in stereoselective copper-catalyzed allylic oxidation of cyclohexene (Scheme 3).26 A series of C1- and C2-symmetric ligands were prepared by Pd-catalyzed amination reactions. Among the numerous ligands prepared, the C1-symmetric ligand L8 exhibited the best performances but the ee remained low (17%).

The straightforward functionalisation of the bridging NH of dpa was used for the immobilisation of a Pd-catalyst in water. A PEG-tagged dpa ligand was prepared and coordinated to Pd(OAc)2.27 The resulting catalyst C29 was used for the aqueous phase aerobic oxidation of styrene resulting in the selective formation of benzaldehyde in 82% yield along with acetophenone, benzoic acid and other unidentified compounds (Scheme 4). This catalyst led to better performances than other palladium catalysts coordinated with other N-ligands. It is noteworthy that the catalyst could be reused up to 7 times without the alteration of its performances.

The catalytic properties of the [Cp*Ir(dpa)Cl]Cl complex C19 (Fig. 10) were investigated in the very challenging and important water oxidation reaction driven by Cerium Ammonium Nitrate (CAN).28 Not only did this catalyst perform better than the bipyridine-based catalyst [Cp*Ir(bpy)Cl]Cl but it exhibited a peculiar behaviour as CAN was always consumed faster than O2 evolution. An extreme situation was found with a CAN/Cat ratio of 80 for which CAN was almost fully consumed before O2 evolution began. The authors assumed that the bridging NH moiety of the dpa ligand might be responsible for the easier oxidative degradation of C19 leading to more active catalytic sites as reported by Fukuzumi.29 Based on the kinetic and DFT studies, the authors proposed an alternative pathway involving the formation and transfer of an O–O bond-containing moiety from Ir to Ce species followed by oxygen release. Yet in the domain of sustainable energy sources, an electron-enriched iridium complex C30 was prepared and evaluated in the dehydrogenation of formic acid (Scheme 5).30 This catalyst achieved a TOF of 12321 at pH 1.8. In contrast to most iridium-based catalysts which exhibited their best performances at pH 3.5–4 (i.e. pKa of formic acid), C30 performed best at pH 1.8 (i.e. no added sodium formate). It was also demonstrated that C30 could maintain its performances within a concentration range going from 2 M to 8 M. Noteworthily, the catalyst could be used in pure formic acid in which a TOF of 4800 h−1 was reached hence demonstrating the high stability of this catalyst in acidic media. Based on the comparative study of numerous catalysts bearing diversely substituted dpa ligands, the authors proposed a mechanism involving H-bonding between formic acid and the proton of the bridging NH. Another liquid organic hydrogen carrier (LHOC), namely tetrahydroquinoline, could be efficiently dehydrogenated in water by C30 leading to quinoline in 98% yield.31 Interestingly, the same catalyst was able to promote the reverse reaction under mild conditions of temperature and pressure (Scheme 5). This protocol was extended to numerous derivatives that could be efficiently converted in either way.

2.3 Olefin polymerisation
The nickel complexes C31–C33 (Fig. 13) are highly active catalysts for the oligomerization of ethylene into C4–C6 products. These complexes required initial activation by Et3Al2Cl3 in excess (Al/Ni = 600) and the reactions were performed at low temperature (12–30 °C) in dichloromethane under 0.6–1.3 bar for 1 h. With the most efficient catalysts C32 and C33, turnover numbers of about 600000 were reached with the major formation of the C4–C6 fraction including more than 90% of butenes (C4–C6:C8–C16:>C16 ratio of 71:23:6 were obtained with C33). The oligomers were highly branched with a ratio of methyl protons to total alkyl protons of 0.61 for the higher boiling fraction.32
 Fig. 13  Nickel(II) complexes used in ethylene oligomerization. 
When the binuclear Ni(II) complexes C34–C38 (Fig. 14) were associated with alkylaluminium reagents under ethylene oligomerization conditions, an excellent activity was obtained when Et2AlCl was used whereas methylaluminoxane led to an inefficient catalytic system. Thus, with an Al/Ni ratio of 250, a catalytic activity leading to the production of 499–662 kg of oligomers per mol of nickel per h under 5 bar of ethylene at 30 °C was achieved corresponding to a TOF located in the range of 18000–24000 h−1. Remarkably, under these conditions only butenes (C4 fraction) were formed and catalyst C38 proved to be very selective affording the terminal 1-butene with 98% selectivity.33 The mononuclear cationic palladium(II) complexes C39–C43 (Fig. 14) were prepared with the same 2,2′-dipyridylamine ligands and evaluated in ethylene oligomerization. Without any cocatalyst, these palladium species oligomerised ethylene at 25 °C in dichloromethane under 5 bar of ethylene. However, if the selectivity towards the formation of butenes was good, the productivity was low (TOF = 4.4 to 7.4 h−1).34

It is noteworthy that 1-octene or 1-hexene as sole olefins were formed together with low molecular weight polyethylene wax when ethylene (40 bar) was treated at high temperature (>80 °C) with 400 equivalents of methylaluminoxane in the presence of chromium complexes equipped with differently substituted dipyridylamine ligands as shown in Scheme 6.35 This selectivity was ascribed to steric factors, the less hindered ligands around the metal center such as C45 producing 1-octene.
 Scheme 6  Influence of steric hindrance of the dpa ligand on ethylene oligomerization. 
One or two dipyridylamine moieties connected to a polyethylene glycol chain in L10 and L11 were used in atom transfer radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate associated with a copper(II) halide (CuBr2 or CuCl2·2H2O) as the metal catalyst precursor (Fig. 15). The polymerization reactions were carried out under thermo-regulated phase-transfer catalysis conditions using a water–toluene mixture as a solvent. The copper-dpa catalyst was maintained in the aqueous phase at room temperature and transferred into the organic phase during the polymerization process at 90 °C. After cooling, the catalyst was recovered in the aqueous phase and polymethacrylate was extracted from the organic phase.36

Dipyridylamines have also been supported on polynorbornene obtained by the ring opening metathesis of a functionalized norbornene with a molybdenum catalyst and on coated silica. When these materials were loaded with CuBr·Me2S or Cu(OAc)2/Al(OiPr)3, styrene could be polymerized in moderate yields (<25%) following an atom transfer radical polymerization process initiated by ethyl-2-bromoisobutyrate.37
The cationic cobalt(III) complex [Co((L1)2)Me2]I C46 (Fig. 16) proved to be an excellent catalyst for the polymerization of acrylonitrile in methanol in the presence of NaBH4. It was shown that this polymerization did not involve a radical or an anionic mechanism but a coordination-type mechanism, where the borohydride reduced the cobalt(III) complex into a catalytically active cobalt(I) species able to coordinate the acrylic double bond and favor successive insertions into a Co–C bond.38
 Fig. 16  Cobalt(III) bis(L1) complex C46. 
Finally, the rhodium complex [Rh(cod)(L1)]PF6 was used in the polymerization of alkynes such as phenylacetylene and the functional N-propargylamine.39 Its catalytic properties in the formation of polyolefins from alkynes have been compared with those of other rhodium complexes equipped with other bidentate dinitrogen ligands such as 2,2′-bipyridine L2, 2,2′-bipyrazine and 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine, and associated with other counter anions. It was shown that the nature of the ligands and counter anions as well as the presence of NaOH as a cocatalyst had an influence on the fate of the polymerization. In both cases, polymerization of phenylacetylene and N-propargylamine, the [Rh(cod)(L1)]PF6 complex exhibited better performances than the corresponding [Rh(cod)(L2)]PF6.
2.4 Hydrolysis of esters
The dicationic species [Cu(L1)(H2O)2]2+C47 was claimed as the first catalyst able to perform the hydrolysis of unactivated esters such as methyl acetate at 25 °C at pH 7 with a rate constant similar to that obtained with natural esterases such as chymotrypsin.40 The same copper complex was also able to hydrolyze formamides under neutral pH conditions but a higher temperature was required (Scheme 7).41
 Scheme 7  Hydrolysis of esters and formamides in the presence of the copper(dipyridylamine) catalyst C47. 
Later on, the use of this type of copper catalyst was extended to more functionalized esters such as glycine ethyl esters,42 and other types of esters such as phosphotriesters.43
The carbonate protecting group of allyloxycarbonyl-coumarin has been removed upon treatment with phenylsilane in the presence of palladium-dipyridylamine catalysts such as C48 supported on polymer brushes (Scheme 8).44 This system is operating as a reservoir of catalytic species that are progressively released in solution and the influence of the thickness of the surface has been studied in detail.

2.5 Transesterification
2,2′-Dipyridylamine (L1) has been coordinated to zinc, cadmium and mercury leading to various types of mononuclear complexes and polymeric forms, which have been evaluated in transesterification reactions. Thus, when Zn(OBz)2 (OBz = benzoate) was reacted with L1, the monomeric complex Zn(OBz)2(L1) was formed, whereas ZnBr2 and ZnCl2 produced hydrogen-bonded ZnX2(L1) polymers. On the other hand, Zn(H2O)2(L1)(SO4) was obtained as a coordination polymer from Zn(SO4) and L1. All these forms exhibited catalytic activity for the transesterification of various benzoates and acetates with methanol with a catalyst loading of 4 mol% leading to complete conversion within 2–9 days into methyl benzoate and methyl acetate, respectively.45 The hydrogen-bonded [ZnCl2(L1)] heterogeneous system appeared to exhibit the best efficiencies. Later on, it was shown that the introduction of a nitrate ligand in [Zn(NO3)(L1)2][NO3] provided a more efficient catalyst.46 The substitution of zinc by cadmium has led to a variety of cadmium complexes featuring one, two or three dpa ligands. All of them were tested in the transesterification reaction of acetates and benzoates with methanol and [Cd(L1)3][ClO4]2 offered the best catalytic activity.47 Notably, the mercury complexes Hg(OBz)2(L1) and Hg2(L1)2(NO3)2 have also shown catalytic activity for transesterification reactions.48
2.6 Cross coupling reactions
There are only a few examples of application of 2,2′-dipyridylamine derivatives as ligands associated with palladium in cross coupling reactions and they are mostly devoted to catalysis in water or aqueous biphasic media.
Thermo-regulated systems have been reported, where the central nitrogen atom of the dpa (L12) is connected to a decyloctaethyleneglycol and coordinated to a palladium centre upon treatment with Na2PdCl4 to generate the neutral C49 and dicationic palladium complex C50 (Scheme 9).49 These complexes are readily prepared and show different solubility properties due to the presence of the amphiphilic ligand; the neutral C49 is insoluble in water whereas the ionic C50 is soluble. The Heck reaction was carried out at 110–120 °C in biphasic aqueous media with in situ generated catalysts based on Na2PdCl4 and an excess of ligand. The organic phase consisted of the substrates without additional solvents. The catalytic reactions took place in this organic phase and after cooling the catalyst was transferred to the water phase and the products were isolated from the organic phase. Starting from iodobenzene, E-cinnamic acid was isolated in 89% yield after 20 h from ethyl acrylate, whereas trans-stilbene was recovered in more than 90% yield after 40 h from styrene. The catalyst recovered in the aqueous phase could be reused but its activity decreased probably because of the accumulation of salts in this phase.

The copper-free Sonogashira coupling was also performed efficiently at room temperature in water with an in situ generated catalyst based on equimolar amounts of Pd(NH3)2Cl2 as the metal precursor and L1 as the bidentate ligand (Scheme 10).50 The reaction required the presence of triethylamine as a base while other organic amines such as diisopropylamine, propylamine or tributylamine as well as inorganic bases such as KOH, NaOAC, K3PO4, CS2CO3 were inefficient. In this study, it was shown that the dipyridylamine ligand triggered much higher catalytic activity than other bidentate nitrogen ligands such as 2,2′-bipyridine L2, 1,10-phenanthroline L3, 2-imidazol-2-ylpyridine and 2-pyrazol-3-ylpyridine. The cross-coupling reaction of phenylacetylene and electron-enriched phenylacetylenes with various phenyl iodides gave more than 73% yield of the corresponding 1,2-diarylacetylenes whereas lower yields located in the range of 59–73% were obtained with the electron-deficient 4-acetylphenylacetylene.
 Scheme 10  Sonogashira coupling promoted by an L1-containing palladium catalyst. 
The Suzuki–Miyaura coupling was also achieved in water with palladium complexes equipped with ionic water soluble dipyridylamine ligands. These complexes were obtained by the treatment of Pd(OAc)2 with equimolar amounts of ligands L13–L15 in dichloromethane (Scheme 11).51
 Scheme 11  Suzuki–Miyaura coupling in water soluble palladium catalysts based on ionic dipyridylamines. 
Pd(OAc)2(L15) was the most active catalyst for the cross coupling of aryl bromides and chlorides with arylboronic acids indicating a clear effect of the pendant ionic group of the ligands. A turnover frequency of 96000 h−1 was reached during the coupling of 4-bromoacetophenone and phenylboronic acid at 100 °C in water in the presence of 0.001 mol% of this catalyst leading to 96% yield of 4-acetylbiphenyl within 1 h. Arylbromides containing electron-withdrawing groups in the 4-position gave the cross coupling products in excellent yields in short reaction times (less than 1 h) with 0.1 mol% catalyst loading. In addition, the catalyst tolerated the presence of withdrawing and donating functional groups in the arylboronic acid partner without loss of reactivity. Starting from arylchlorides required more drastic conditions including longer reaction times and the presence of a phase transfer agent such as tetra-n-butylammonium bromide. In these systems, nanoparticles with small size and narrow size distribution stabilized by the ionic dipyridylamine ligands were detected at the end of the reactions.
Ring opening copolymerization of (Z)-9-oxabicyclo[6.1.0]non-4-ene with tris(cyclooct-4-enyl-1-oxy)methylsilane with a Grubbs third generation ruthenium catalyst has been used to prepare palladium nanoparticles embedded in the pores of a polymeric support (Scheme 12).52 This material C51 has shown catalytic activity for the Suzuki–Miyaura cross coupling of bromobenzene derivatives with phenylboronic acid at 50 °C for 24 h in water in the presence of tBuOK as a base and tetra-n-butylammonium bromide as a phase transfer agent. Assuming that only the surface palladium atoms participated in the catalytic reaction, turnover numbers up to 2940 were reached. On the other hand, this catalyst was much less efficient for the copper-free cross coupling of the same bromobenzene substrates with phenylacetylene at 80 °C leading to a moderate 36% yield, whereas iodobenzene proved to be much more reactive providing 95% yield upon reaction with 2,4,6-trimethylphenylacetylene.

Finally, nickel species generated in situ from equimolar amounts of NiBr2·3H2O and L1 have been used for the reductive coupling of aryl halides in ethanol at room temperature under electrolysis conditions at a constant current of 0.6 A dm−2 (Scheme 13). Under similar conditions, the reductive cross coupling of arylbromides with electron-deficient olefins such as acrylates and ethyl maleate was also achieved in good yields, whereas acrylonitrile and ethyl methacrylate were not reactive (Scheme 13).53

Dipyridylamine copper complexes have been used as catalysts for the oxidative coupling of 2,6-dimethylphenol. Depending on the nature of the catalyst precursor and the experimental conditions, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl-4,4′-diphenoquinone (DPQ) and poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene ether) (PPE) could be formed (Scheme 14). Under mild conditions, e.g. 25 °C under atmospheric pressure of dioxygen in a methanol/toluene mixture as a solvent, the copper complex C52 (catalyst loading: 0.4 mol%) led to the selective formation of the PPE polymer.54

The oxidation of 2,6-dimethylphenol was also studied with H2O2 as the oxidant and the copper complex with the proposed structure C53 as the catalyst in aqueous buffer in the range of pH 6.0–9.0 at 25 °C. It was shown that the L1 ligand provided the most efficient catalyst and that the initial rate of formation of DPQ strongly depended on the value of the pH, the maximum being located around pH 7.55 The introduction of surfactants into the reaction medium such as cetyl trimethylammonium bromide leading to the formation of micelles had a beneficial effect on the rate of oxidation of 2,6-dimethylphenol and favored the formation of the PPE polymer.56
2.7 Miscellaneous reactions

Photocatalyzed aza-Henry reaction. 
Among a series of cationic iridium complexes featuring two N,C-cyclometallated ligands based on benzoquinoline, 2-phenylisoquinoline, and dpa L1, the iridium complex C54 has revealed efficient catalytic properties for the photocatalyzed aza-Henry reaction involving N-phenyltetrahydroisoquinoline and nitromethane (Scheme 15).57 In the presence of 1 mol% of catalyst C54, full conversion of the aromatic substrate was achieved and 69% of the product resulting from selective sp3 C–H bond activation/functionalization at the benzylic position of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring was obtained at room temperature in air within 11 h. This result competes with the 79% isolated yield obtained with the more active [Ir(2-phenylpyridine)2(di-tert-butylbipyridine)][PF6] catalyst used for comparison.

Hydroformylation of olefins. 
Very early on, 2,2′-dipyridylamine L1 has been used in hydroformylation of olefins for comparison purposes with other bidentate nitrogen ligands such as 2,2′-bipyridine L2 and 1,10-phenanthroline L3. For instance the hydroformylation of 1-octene at 180 °C with a pressure of CO/H2 (1:2 ratio) of 80 bar in the presence of 3 mol% of RuO2-L1 as a catalyst precursor led to a mixture of branched and linear nonanals and nonanols with major formation of alcohols, and a reactivity and selectivity comparable to the results obtained with bipyridine ligands.58 On the other hand, the catalytic species generated from Ru3(CO)12 and L1 on the silica carrier was active in hydroformylation of 1-hexene at 150 °C under 50 bar of syngas and led to heptanals as major products but the productivity remained lower than when bipyridine was used.59

3. Photoluminescent materials
A rapid survey of the literature shows that around 700 complexes bearing dipyridylamine derivatives as ligands are reported in the literature. These include chromium,60 molybdenum,61 manganese,62 rhenium,63 iron,64 ruthenium,65 osmium,65c,66 cobalt,67 rhodium,65c iridium,65c,67,68 nickel,69 palladium,70 platinum,70a,71 copper,72 silver,73 gold,74 zinc,75 cadmium,76 and mercury77 as metal centers. Among this plethora of transition metal complexes, chromium,78 rhenium,79 ruthenium,80 osmium,81 rhodium,82 iridium,83 palladium,84 platinum,85 copper,86 silver,87 zinc,88 cadmium,89 and mercury complexes90 have been reported to emit or absorb in the visible region. These photophysical properties render this class of organometallic complexes interesting for ion or organic molecule detection by selective binding of cations accompanied by a luminescent response, for electroluminescent materials such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs)91 or light-emitting electrochemical diodes (LECs),92 for nuclear detection via plastic scintillators93 and finally for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by using the absorption properties in the visible region.
3.1 Ion and organic molecule detection
Regarding the ion or organic molecule detection, two strategies can be considered, (i) the fluorescence (or phosphorescence) extinction when an ion binds or interacts with the emissive complex; and (ii) the generation or strong modification of fluorescence (or phosphorescence) when an ion binds or an organic molecule interacts with a non-emissive complex. The most representative examples are based on a strategy (i). However, some dpa derivatives are known to be intrinsically fluorescent88e–f,94 and, as mentioned above, several transition metal complexes possess fluorescence properties.
As a first example, a star-shaped ligand L16 (Fig. 17) possessing a benzene core and 6 biphenyl-2,2′-dipyridylamine substituents has been synthesized and studied in self-assembling on the graphite surface.95 In the presence of a copper(II) salt, ligand L16 leads to a non-emissive 2D extended structure. The quenching of the fluorescence properties of L16 (emission wavelength (λem) = 409 nm in dichloromethane solution) was reached when a 1:2 ratio of L16:CuII was used. Unfortunately, no other cation has been studied to show selectivity for such extinction selectivity.
 Fig. 17  Structure of the star-shaped ligand 16. 
Simpler structures having two to three dpa units (ligands L17–L20, Fig. 18) and the corresponding copper(I) complexes have also been described (Fig. 19). Various copper salts (CuI, CuBr and CuCN) were investigated and, surprisingly, depending on the salt, various polymetallic structures were characterized.96 As copper(I) can coordinate two dpa ligands, organometallic polymers were formed adopting different conformations (trans, cis, inward- and outward-conformations), depending on the copper(I) precursor and the ligand/metal ratio (Fig. 19).
 Fig. 18  Structures of poly-dpa derivatives L17–L20. 
 Fig. 19  Coordination modes of ligands L17–L20. 
Notably, the two pyridine units were not always coordinated to the copper(I) metal center. In some cases, each pyridine bound a different metal center leading to a 2D metal organic framework (MOF). Interestingly, a complete extinction of the blue fluorescence observed with the free ligand L17 (λem = 423 nm (main band) and 517 nm (shoulder) in dichloromethane solution) was observed with the organometallic polymer generated with ligand L17. The emission spectra of L17 in the presence of different concentrations of copper(I) salt showed a drastic decrease of the fluorescence until a 1:6 ratio of L17:Cu(I). In this work, no selectivity in binding metal salts was reported. Such study was demonstrated with a second family of poly-dpa ligands, namely 1,2-, 1,3-, 1,4-(2,2′-dipyridylaminomethyl)benzene ligands L21, L22 and L24, 2,6-bis-(2,2′-dipyridylaminomethyl)pyridine L23 and 1,3,5-tris-(2′,2′′-dipyridylaminomethylbenzene L25 for bulk membrane transport (Fig. 20).97 The coordination properties of these polydentate ligands were investigated with various silver(I) salts. The selectivity in binding metal ions depends on the nature of the fluxional core. Indeed, in the presence of a mixture of transition metal salts (Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), Ag(I) and Pb(II)), dpa derivatives L22–L23 and L25 bind selectively the silver(I) cation. Unfortunately, no emission of the ligands or of the resulting silver(I) complexes has been reported.
 Fig. 20  Structures of poly-dpa derivatives L21–L25. 
In 2000, the coordination of 2,2′,2′′-tripyridylamine L26 and 2,2′,3′′-tripyridylamine L27 with various Zn(II) salts has been studied (Fig. 21).98
 Fig. 21  Structures of ligands L26 and L27. 
Ligand L26 acted as a chelate with ZnCl2 (1 equivalent of L26) or Zn(OTf)2 (2 equivalents of L26) whereas only the 3-substituted pyridine moiety in ligand L27 bound Zn(OTf)2. The authors stated that the different modes of coordination (four ligands L27 mono-coordinated to the zinc metal centre) were due to some steric hindrance. Interestingly, all the corresponding Zn(II) complexes exhibited a blue emission (λem between 422 and 432 nm).
Later, the coordination behavior of the 2,2′,3′′-tripyridylamine ligand L27 has been studied with different silver(I) and zinc(II) metal salts.99 Various dinuclear complexes or 1D organometallic polymers were obtained with silver depending on the nature of the anion (CF3CO2−, TfO−, PF6− or ClO4−). Silver complexes are in a general manner di or tri-coordinated to two or three ligands L27. Unlike zinc which was able to bind 3-substituted pyridines, ligand L27 binds nonspecifically the silver metal centre by 2- or 3-substituted pyridine rings. The emissions of these silver complexes were observed between 366 and 368 nm in acetonitrile solution when ligand L27 was emitting at 361 nm. The silver complexes also exhibited lower photoluminescence quantum yield (φem between 0.16 and 0.18 for silver complexes vs. 0.38 for ligand L27). This property allowed the silver ion detection through the analysis of the decrease of the fluorescence intensity. Good correlation with the silver concentration (up to 4 mM) was obtained. Noteworthily, no decrease of fluorescence was observed in the presence of zinc(II) salts.
For organic molecule detection, Wang, Brown and co-workers reported the synthesis and photophysical properties of a zinc(II) complex in which the star-shaped ligand L28 possessed a 1,3,6-tris-(4′-dpa)phenylbenzene core L28 (Fig. 22).88i
 Fig. 22  Structure of ligand L28. 
In the presence of three equivalents of ZnCl2, ligand L28 led to the formation of the complex [(ZnCl2)3L28]. This complex exhibited a broad fluorescence with an emission wavelength λem at 417 nm in solution and 432 nm in the solid state. Then, complex [(ZnCl2)3L28] has been introduced in an optical sensor and twelve different solvents (500 ppm) were selected to measure the decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the zinc(II) complex. As a result, benzene led to an important decrease in the fluorescence intensity whereas the structurally close solvents xylene and toluene almost did not alter its fluorescence intensity. Other protic polar solvents, alkanes or halogenated solvents did not modify the fluorescence. Based on the crystallographic data, the affinity of benzene with [(ZnCl2)3L28] was observed through π–π interactions between the aromatic ring and the core of the ligand L28. These interactions might be responsible for fluorescence quenching.
Finally, a dpa derivative based on guanosine has also been investigated for zinc salt detection.100 The fluorescence of the ligand L29 decreased upon the addition of 6 equivalents of Zn(ClO4)2·6H2O or Zn[(S)-O2CCH(Br)CH(CH3)CH3]2 without any shift of the emission wavelength, while a red-shift (from 403 nm to nearly 490 nm for λem) and a decrease of the fluorescence intensity were observed with the analogous ligand L30. This double effect rendered the detection of the zinc(II) salt easier (Fig. 23).
 Fig. 23  Structure of guanosine chelates L29 and L30. 
3.2 Electro and photoluminescent materials
Fluorescent or phosphorescent transition metal complexes can also find applications in electroluminescent materials such as OLEDs91 and LECs.92 Both devices are dedicated for light applications and the most important difference is that LEC devices are specific of ionic transition metal complexes which lead to a simpler architecture device as no injection and transport electron or hole layers are required.
In 2010, Huo et al. synthesized dpa-based ligands L31 and L32 bearing either a phenyl or a (2′,4′-difluorophenyl) substituent and the corresponding cyclometallated platinum complexes C55–C56 (Fig. 24).101 The phosphorescence emissions of such platinum complexes have been assigned by the author to an admixture of intraligand charge transfer (ILCT) and metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT). The C55 complex exhibited a high quantum yield of 0.74 with two maxima for the emission wavelengths at 512 and 548 nm (in 2-methyltetrahydrofuran solution). Due to its highly emissive properties (φem), complex C55 has been investigated in OLED technology with an optimized device configuration consisting of ITO/CFx/NBP/TCTA/(TPBI + 30 wt% TCTA) + 4 wt% C55/TPBi/Alq/Mg:Ag (ITO: indium tin oxide; CFx, NPB: 4,4′-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl; TCTA: 4,4′,4′′-tris(N-carbazolyl)-triphenylamine; TPBi: 1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimidazol-2-yl)benzene). The best device showed bright green emission (λem/CIE coordinates (x,y): 512 nm/0.318,0.622) with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 14.7% and a current efficiency of 50.0 Cd A−1 at a current density of 0.01 mA cm−2. The highest luminance L of 3698 Cd m−2 was observed at a current density of 10 mA m−2 (at 8.64 V) but also led to a decrease of the EQE to 10.6%.
 Fig. 24  Structure of ligands L31 and L32 and platinum(II) complexes C55 and C56. 
In direct line with the previous study, the unsymmetrical dpa derivatives L33–L35 were prepared and the corresponding platinum(II) complexes were evaluated in the preparation of new OLED devices (Fig. 25).102
 Fig. 25  Structure of ligands L33–L35 and platinum(II) complexes C57–C59. 
The three platinum(II) complexes C57–C59 (Fig. 25) were green emitters with λem ranging from 504 to 513 nm with a shoulder centered approximately at 535 nm (in degassed dichloromethane). Complexes with ligands L33 and L34 exhibited photoluminescence quantum yields of 0.27, when the C59 complex displayed a quantum yield of 0.47 (in degassed dichloromethane relative to fac-[Ir(ppy)3], φem = 0.4). The OLED devices possessed the following architecture ITO/HAT-CN/TAPC/TCTA/mCP: Pt(II) (10 wt%)/TmPyPB/Liq/Al (HAT-CN: 1,4,5,8,9,11-hexaazatriphenylene-hexacarbonitrile; TAPC: 1,1-[4-[N,N-di(p-tolyl)-amino]phenyl]cyclohexane; mCP: 1,3-bis(N-carbazolyl)benzene; TmPyPB: 1,3,5-tri[(3-pyridyl)-phen-3-yl]benzene; Liq: 8-hydroxyquinolinolato lithium). The emissions of the devices were slightly red-shifted compared to the emissions in solution. Indeed, C57 emitted greenish yellow light (λem/CEI coordinates (x,y): 548 nm/0.44,0.53) with an EQE of 11.8%, a current efficiency of 38.8 Cd A−1 and a power efficiency of 20.2 lm W−1 at brightness of 1000 Cd m−1. C58 and C59 complexes showed yellowish-green emission (λem/CEI coordinates (x,y): 540 nm for both complexes/0.36,0.58 and 0.32,0.61, respectively) with EQEs of 11.5 and 11.9, current efficiencies of 38.5 and 42.4 Cd A−1, and power efficiencies of 23.7 and 29.4 20.2 lm W−1 at brightness of 1000 Cd m−1, respectively.
The ligand L36 having 6,6′-trifluoromethylpyrazolyl substituent has been coordinated to an osmium(II) metal center associated with phosphine ligands (Fig. 26).103 The two synthesized complexes [Os(L36)(PMePh2)2] and [Os(L36)(PMe2Ph)2] exhibited strong red emission at λem 628 and 634 nm with φem of 0.40 and 0.27 (in degassed dichloromethane), respectively. Due to these strong deep red emissions of complexes [Os(L36)(PMePh2)2] and [Os(L36)(PMe2Ph)2], organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been prepared with the following architecture ITO/NPB/TCTA/TPBi: [Os(L36)(PMePh2)2] or [Os(L36)(PMe2Ph)2] (4 vol%)/TPBi/LiF/Al (NPB: 4,4′-bis[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl; TCTA: 4,4′,4′′-tris(N-carbazolyl)-triphenylamine; TPBi: 1,3,5-tris(N-phenylbenzimidazol-2-yl)benzene). In addition to the devices prepared with complexes [Os(L36)(PMePh2)2] C60 and [Os(L36)(PMe2Ph)2] C61, a device doped with [Ir(piq)3] was prepared for comparison (piq: phenyl isoquinoline). All devices prepared with [Ir(piq)3], C60 and C61 exhibited a deep red emission with CIE coordinates at (0.67,0.33), (0.63,0.36) and (0.65,0.35) with a current density of 5 mA cm−2, respectively. Both devices prepared with complexes C60 and C61 showed better performance than the device with [Ir(piq)3] as a phosphorescent dopant. The highest current efficiency of 14.0 Cd A−1 at 5 mA cm−2 and the best EQE of 9.8% were observed with the device prepared with complex C60. However, the devices prepared with Os(II) complexes required higher operation voltage than with the Ir(III) complex due to the shallow HOMO level of Os(II) which may induce a large carrier injection barrier and charge trap.
 Fig. 26  Structure of ligand L36 and osmium(II) complexes [Os(L36)(PMePh2)2] C60 and [Os(L36)(PMe2Ph)2] C61. 
The tridentate extended dpa derivative L37 incorporating an additional 2-pyridylamino framework on the dpa motif has been extensively studied by the group of Heinze and the properties of the corresponding complexes have been compared with those of their analogous complexes bearing the tripyridine ligand L38 (Fig. 27).78c,104
 Fig. 27  Structures of tridentate ligands L37–L38. 
Among these complexes, the photoluminescent ruthenium(II) complexes C62–C64, bearing either L37 or L38 ligand in combination with an ester-substituted terpyridine ligand, have been studied in light emitting electrochemical cell (LEC) technology (Fig. 28).105
 Fig. 28  Structure of ruthenium(II) complexes C62–C64. 
The configuration of the material was based on the following structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ruthenium(II) complex/Ag (PEDOT: poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)); PSS: poly(styrenesulfonate). Different devices have been prepared with or without 20 wt% PMMA (poly(methylmethacrylate)) as the additive with complexes C62 or C63 as phosphorescent dopants of the emissive layer. At low voltage (3 V), only the device incorporating complex C63 without PMMA emitted in the red region (λem; CIE coordinates (x,y): 731 nm; 0.725,0.275). At higher voltage (up to 6 V), the devices with PMMA as the additive and incorporating the Ru(II) complexes C62–C63 emitted in the red to near infra-red region (λem/CIE coordinates (x,y): 733 nm/0.709–0.291 for C62 at 4 V; 722 nm/0.717–0.283 for C63 at 6 V; 745 nm/0.729/0.271 for C64 at 5 V). The authors stated that these tridentate ligand–ruthenium complexes containing devices were the LECs possessing the longest emission wavelength. Regarding the highest performances of these LEC devices, luminance (L) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) were obtained with the device incorporating complex C63 at a voltage of 6 V and was measured at 3.4 cd m−2 and 0.028%, respectively.
Photoluminescent cationic copper(I) complexes bearing dpa ligand L1 in association with N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC)86 have also been studied in LEC technology. The cationic copper(I) complex C65 (Fig. 29) exhibited a bright and blue emission with λem at 463 nm.
 Fig. 29  Structures of complexes C65–C68. 
The λem was ascribed to a MLCT and presented a large Stokes shift. The analog complexes [Cu(bpy)(IPr)][PF6] (C66)86 or [Cu(phen)(IPr)][OTf] (C67)106 (Fig. 29) both exhibited a weak and red-shifted λem around 650 nm. This important difference in the λem is due to the strong electron donating properties of the central nitrogen atom in the dpa ligand. Indeed, the DRX analyses of these different copper(I) complexes showed that the dpa ligand is planar in a general manner indicating that the p orbital of the nitrogen atom is parallel to the p orbital of the pyridine ring thus allowing the delocalization of the electrons in the pyridine rings. This structural observation was also confirmed by DFT and TD-DFT calculations.107
DFT calculations have also shown that the HOMO of complex C65 was located on the metal center and the LUMO mainly located on the dpa ligand. In this complex, the λem is ruled by the nitrogen ligand, unlike the bipyridine or phenanthroline complexes. The introduction of electron withdrawing groups, stabilizing the LUMO, generated a red shift of the λem whereas electron donor groups, destabilizing the LUMO, generated a blue shift of the λem. Taking advantage of the blue luminescence of the family of (NHC) copper(I) complexes bearing 2,2′-dipyridylamine ligands, one of the brightest complexes having photoluminescent quantum yield (φem) up to 0.86 has been applied in the fabrication of light emitting electrochemical cells (LECs).108 Devices obtained with complex C68 were the first LEC incorporating cationic copper complexes having blue emission (with CIE coordinate of 0.23/0.28) showing figure of merits similar to those obtained for LECs incorporating iridium complexes, at that time. Nevertheless, their lifetimes t1/2 were short with a best value of 16.5 min.
In the context of nuclear detection with a plastic scintillator,109 dpa ligands have also been used as ancillary ligands for cationic cyclometallated iridium(III) complexes (cyclometallating ligands = 2-phenylpyridine, ppy; N-phenylpyrazine, ppz; benzoquinoline, bzq or phenylisoquinoline, piq) (Fig. 30).110 The photophysical properties of the corresponding complexes have been studied and compared to those of complexes incorporating a bipyridine L2 or phenanthroline L3 ligand.
 Fig. 30  General structure of cationic cyclometallated iridium(III) complexes with N^N ancillary ligands. 
Considering the absorption spectra, the profile appeared to be mainly driven by the cyclometallating ligand. Nevertheless, replacing bipyridine L2 or phenanthroline L3 ligands by dpa L1 led in most cases to a blue shift of the λem originating from a MLCT. Some of these cationic iridium(III) complexes have been selected as dopants for the preparation of plastics. Due to the solubility issue of these complexes in the styrene matrix, samples were prepared with a concentration below or equal to 0.05 wt%. Among the plastics obtained, those incorporating dpa-iridium complexes exhibited emission resulting only from the styrene matrix due to the low φem of the dopant. Best results of radio- and photoluminescence were obtained here with plastics incorporating bipyridine or phenanthroline iridium(III) complexes and showed scintillation yields between 400 and 1500 ph MeV−1.
3.3 Application in dye-sensitized solar cells
Dipyridylamine metal complexes have also been studied as catalysts in photoredox chemistry thanks to their photophysical properties, and more specifically their absorption in the visible region,57 but also in materials science and more particularly as components for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). To the best of our knowledge, the first example was reported in 2009 by Masuda and co-workers.111 The dpa derivative L39 was used as an ancillary ligand of a ruthenium(II) complex C69. Both the tert-butyl and methoxy substituents on N-phenyl-2,2′-dipyridylamine modified the HOMO and LUMO energy level and increased the lifetime performance of the device (Fig. 31).
 Fig. 31  Structure of ligand L39 and complexes C69–C70. 
The absorption spectrum of complex C69 showed two bands centered at 381 nm (molar extinction coefficient (ε) = 14.7 × 103 M−1 cm−1) and 514 nm (ε = 49.4 × 103 M−1 cm−1) which are assigned to MLCT bands. The ionization potential (Eox) was measured at −5.1 eV, which is 0.3 eV more negative than the one of I2/I3−. The excited-state ionization potential ( or ) of C69, obtained from zero–zero excitation energy (E0–0), was approximated at −3.3 eV, which is 0.6 eV more positive than the TiO2 conduction band. Devices were prepared with complex C69 and the so-called N719 complex C70 (Eox = −6.01 eV and ).112 The device prepared with C69 led to a short circuit current density (JSC) of 17.3 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photo-voltage (Voc) of 640 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 0.65, giving an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 7.2%. Interestingly, these performances were slightly lower than the one observed under the same conditions with the ruthenium complex C70.
The group of Kim modified the dipyridylamine ligand by replacing the N-para-methoxy phenyl substituent by an aliphatic chain and the tBu groups of the dpa skeleton by a (hetero)aryl conjugated framework (ligands L40 and L41, Fig. 32).113 The corresponding complexes C71 and C72, analogs of C69, have been prepared and studied in solar cell devices.
 Fig. 32  Structure of ligands L40 and L41, and ruthenium complexes C71 and C72. 
Absorption properties of complexes C71 and C72 were as follows: maxima absorption wavelengths (λabs) of 418 nm (ε = 16.9 × 103 M−1 cm−1) and 531 nm (ε = 10.9 × 103 M−1 cm−1) for C71 and 420 nm (ε = 24.4 × 103 M−1 cm−1) and 531 (ε = 15.4 × 103 M−1 cm−1) for C72. Of note, the molar extinction coefficient of C72 was higher than that of C70 (ε = 14.9 × 103 M−1 cm−1 at λabs = 380 nm and ε = 14.4 × 103 M−1 cm−1 at λabs = 520 nm). The Eox of C71 and C72 were measured at 0.95 and 0.92 V vs. NHE (−3.49 and 3.52 eV vacuum scale) and  approximated at −1.00 and −0.96 V vs. NHE (−5.44 and 5.40 eV vacuum scale), respectively. Solar cell devices with C71 and C72 were prepared and compared with the device using N719. Under the following conditions (0.18 cm2 working area; electrolyte: 0.6 M DMPII, 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI and tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile), the performances were JSC of 17.1 and 18.89 mA cm−2, a Voc of 660 mV (in both cases), and an FF of 0.69 (in both cases), corresponding to η of 7.90 and 8.76%, respectively. Of note, the device prepared with C72 exhibited a higher performance parameter than the one prepared with C70 (η of 8.76 vs. 8.19% for C72vs.C70) and was attributed to the higher ε of C72 compared to C70.
Ruthenium complexes C73–C75 containing ligands L37 (Fig. 27) and L42, represented in Fig. 33, are related to the above-mentioned complexes C62–C64 (Fig. 28). Their deep-red emissions allowed some studies in lighting devices,105 and their absorption properties in the UV and visible regions fitted with DSSC applications.114
 Fig. 33  Structures of ligands L42 and ruthenium(II) complexes C73–C75. 
Indeed, complexes C73–C75 showed several maxima absorption wavelengths assigned to MLCT bands in the visible region between 472 and 680 nm. Nevertheless, the ε values calculated for these complexes were at least three-fold lower than that of C70. Even if the photostability was more important for complexes C73–C75 compared to the N719 complex C70, the performance parameters of DSSCs with complexes C73–C75 as dyes were twenty-fold lower than those of the device prepared with C70 (η = 5.0% for N719 vs. η = 0.26% for complex C63 for example). These poor DSSC performances were attributed to electron recombination with the oxidized electrolyte (I3−) at the TiO2 electrode. The positive charge on the ruthenium(II) complexes might attract the negatively charged I3− near the TiO2 surface and consequently might provoke the undesired back electron transfer. To tackle this issue, positively charged Co3+/Co2+ couples, [Co(bipy)3]2+/3+ and C76, were envisaged to replace the negatively redox mediator I3−/I2.115 Using complex C74 as a dye, several DSSCs were prepared with electrolytes involving [Co(bipy)3]2+/3+ or C76 as the positively charged redox mediator and I3−/I2 for comparison (Fig. 34).
 Fig. 34  Structures of Co2+/Co3+ redox mediators [Co(bipy)3]2+/3+ and C76. 
DSSCs prepared with [Co(bipy)3]2+/3+ showed lower efficiency than the devices using I3−/I2 as the redox mediator, the one elaborated with C76 increased both ISC and VOC and led to an efficiency two-fold higher. To explain the different results with the [Co(bipy)3]2+/3+ and C76 redox mediators, the authors proposed that the efficiency was correlated to the π* orbital energy levels which were higher in the case of the electron rich ligand L39 than with the bipyridine ligand. Importantly, the enhancement of the DSSC efficiency using C76 as the redox mediator depended on the dye as shown later by the same group using another ruthenium(II) complex as the dye and for which I3−/I2 was found to be better than C76.116
4. Conclusion
2,2′-Dipyridylamine and 2,2-dipyridylamine-based metal complexes have been implemented with success in a number of catalytic processes and light-emitting materials and devices. In this review, we have demonstrated that these ligands sometimes lead to improved performances when compared to the ubiquitous 2,2′-bipyridine-based organometallic complexes. One major difference between these two family of ligands is found in the formation of metallacycles with 5- or 6-members, but may be more importantly, the bridging nitrogen atoms in dpa are direct and easily accessible manifolds to modulate the electronic and steric properties of dpa-based ligands. Furthermore, the nitrogen atom is also an anchorage point for supported catalysts or for the design of task specific ligands. Last but not least, the presence of a bridging N–H group at the proximity of a catalytic centre may play a crucial role in substrate orientation/activation and product release through H-bonding. Altogether, these properties make dpa a ligand of high potential which should be considered and utilized with the same attention and interest as other well-established N,N-chelates. It is likely that the future years will see an increasing interest for these so far neglected ligands.
