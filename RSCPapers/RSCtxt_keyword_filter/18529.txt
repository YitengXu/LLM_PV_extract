    , Accepted 15th October 2021First published on 21st October 2021AbstractWith solution-processability, low-temperature proper energy level and superior stability, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is one common hole-transport material for the quantum dot light-emitting diode (QLED) application. However, the conductivity of the traditional PEDOT:PSS is very low, which has an adverse effect on QLED devices. Herein, one surface-annealing method for the PEDOT:PSS film to exchange their original composition and surface morphology is proposed. The advantage of this approach lies in the fact that the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film annealed with toluene (1.25 S cm−1) and ethylene glycol (EG, 10.52 S cm−1) are obviously improved compared with the air-annealing method (0.13 S cm−1). The difference is that the EG-washed PEDOT:PSS film shows a relatively rough surface with more PEDOT domains, whereas the toluene treated PEDOT:PSS film can promote the formation of a smooth, PSS-dominated surface and change the PEDOT chain structure from coiled to linear, thus, the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film is enhanced. As a result, the QLED device achieves a maximum luminance of 31140 cd m−2 and power efficiency of 13.4 lm W−1, showing 48% and 25% enhancements, respectively, compared to the control device. This work provides an efficient approach for improving of perovskite QLED performance.
Introduction
All-inorganic lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) are excellent semiconductors for fabricating photodetectors, solar cells, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) due to their excellent properties, such as solution processability, tunable band gap, narrow full width at half peak and high photoluminescence quantum yields (50–90%).1–5 Since the all-inorganic perovskite QDs first utilized as an emitter layer for the fabrication of QLED devices by Zeng et al. in 2015,6 many researchers devoted themselves to study perovskite QLED devices owing to their excellent optical and electrical properties.7–9 The EQE of the first perovskite QLED was reported to be 0.12% in all-inorganic perovskite cesium halide QLED, and it has exceeded 20% for green-emitting and red-emitting devices, now.10,11
To enhance the performance of perovskite QLED devices, numerous research groups focused on the optimization of perovskite QDs emitting layer, including the QD fabrication method, surface modification, heterostructure construction, and core–shell structure.12–14 However, there are few studies on the improvement of various interfacial layers such as the electron-transport layer (ETL) and the hole-transport layer (HTL), which have a significant effect on the radiative recombination of charge carriers. Generally, QLED device structures include upright structures and inverted structures.15,16 For the inverted structure QLED device, ZnO nanoparticles are usually adopted as ETL. But the hydrolysis reaction process for ZnO nanoparticles can induce the degradation of perovskite, and the ligand (acetate ligand and/or hydroxyl groups) capped on ZnO nanoparticles surface can lead to instability in the perovskite materials and the corresponding QLED devices.17,18 Thus, the reported inverted structure perovskite QLED performance is poor. Based on the above conditions, the upright device is appropriate for high-performance perovskite QLED devices because of their simple preparation and low cost. So far, with efficient hole mobility, low-temperature solution-processability, proper energy level as well as superior stability,19 poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been regarded as the most successful HTL for perovskite QLED devices. Actually, the PEDOT:PSS material exhibits conjugated core–shell structural domain,20 the core is one composite of hole-conducting, containing a short-oxidized PEDOT chain (typically 5–10 repeat units) doped by polyelectrolyte PSS counter ions, and the shell is formed by excess, nonconductive PSS with a thickness of around 3–4 nm.21,22 The microstructure and morphology of the PEDOT:PSS film can be precisely controlled by adjusting the weight ratio of PSS to PEDOT, and this ratio plays a crucial role in PEDOT:PSS conductivity and quality, further deciding the as-fabricated perovskite QLED performance.
Thus far, the commercial PEDOT:PSS (CLEVIOS P VP AI 4083) with PSS to PEDOT weight ratio of 6:1 is usually adopted as HTL for the QLED device fabrication. However, this type of PEDOT:PSS shows strong acidity and low electrical conductivity because excess PSS content has a direct impact on device performance and stability. Currently, several strategies for neutralizing the acidity of PEDOT:PSS have been explored. One classical method is the PEDOT and PSS domains structure modification that can reduce the amount of PSS by adding the additive mixed with PEDOT:PSS. Recent work has shown that mild base and imidazole can be utilized for adjusting the pH of PEDOT:PSS with its surface texture and electronic properties tuned, and the obtained PEDOT:PSS film exhibits excellent morphology and high conductivity.23 As a result, the quality and crystallinity of the perovskite film deposited on top of the PEDOT:PSS film is improved, and the as-fabricated solar cell achieves a high power conversion efficiency and long-term stability. Besides, dimethyl sulfoxide, N,N-dimethylformamide and ethylene glycol (EG) can also be adopted to improve the properties of the PEDOT:PSS film.24 In addition, to add solvents or chemicals to PEDOT:PSS emulsions, annealing processes have also proved to be an effective strategy to optimize the PEDOT:PSS film and this method has been extensively investigated in recent years. For example, Syed et al. reported that modifying the pretreatment annealing atmosphere of PEDOT:PSS with sodium citrate solution can partially remove excess PSS from the PEDOT:PSS film,25 resulting in an almost twofold increase of the PEDOT to PSS ratio compared to that in the pristine PEDOT:PSS film. This work has demonstrated that the surface roughness of the film is increased, which assisted the crystal growth of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer and contributed to the performance of the perovskite solar cells. Moreover, Li et al. showed that using polar solvents such as water, ethanol and a mixture of ethanol and water, annealing atmosphere can also remove the partial PSS fraction from the PEDOT:PSS film surface and further improve the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film.26 Based on the above analyzations, the annealing processes of the PEDOT:PSS film with different atmospheres has drawn considerable interest from researchers in designing perovskite solar cells with super performances, but few approaches for perovskite QLED devices have been reported thus far. Therefore, it is intriguing to address whether post-treatment PEDOT:PSS with a polar or non-polar solution would improve the performance of the perovskite QLED device or not.
In this study, by replacing the common air annealing of the AI 4083 PEDOT:PSS film, we employed one surface modification method to optimize not only the conductivity, but, importantly, the surface composition and morphology of the PEDOT:PSS film. The conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film annealed in toluene and EG can be obviously improved compared with the air-annealing method. The toluene annealing mainly changes the PEDOT chain structure, while the EG-wash mainly removes the surface fraction of the PSS, which in turn leads to an increase in the surface roughness of the film. Besides, the toluene atmosphere annealing can also help to form a smooth PEDOT:PSS film. Furthermore, with toluene atmosphere annealed PEDOT:PSS film, the as-fabricated perovskite QLED device achieves a maximum luminance of 31140 cd m−2, with a power efficiency of 13.4 lm W−1, which were enhanced by 48% and 25%, respectively, compared to the device based on the untreated PEDOT:PSS film. While the QLED device is based on the PEDOT:PSS film cleaned with EG, the brightness and power efficiency of the prepared device are reduced. The reason for this result is due to the increase in surface roughness of the PEDOT:PSS film caused by EG. We thus conclude that the PEDOT:PSS film-annealing method using different atmospheres is one promising approach to realize high-performance perovskite QLED devices.
Experimental section/methods
Materials
PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083), 1,3,5-tris(1-phenyl-2-benzimidazolyl)benzene (TPBi), and poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Lead bromide (PbBr2, 99.99%), cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, 99.9%), octanoic acid (OTAc, 99%), formamidine acetate (FA(Ac), 99%), tetraoctylammonium (TOAB, 98%), toluene (99%), ethylene glycol (EG, 99%) were obtained from Macklin Inc. Toluene and EG were analytical grade. Didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB, 98%) was purchased from Aladdin. All materials were used as received without further purification.
Synthesis of CsPbBr3 QDs
CsPbBr3 QDs were synthesized at room temperature using a previously reported method.27 First, 0.1 mmol of Cs2CO3 and 0.2 mmol of FA(Ac) were dissolved in 1 mL of OTAc. Then, 1 mmol of PbBr2 and 2 mmol of TOAB were added to 10 mL of toluene and stirred until dissolved. In 9 mL of PbBr2–toluene solution, 0.85 mL of the obtained Cs+ precursor solvent and 0.15 mL of FA+ were added and stirred for five minutes. After that, 3 mL of DDAB (10 mg mL−1 of toluene) was added and after stirring for two minutes, a crude solution of CsPbBr3 QDs was obtained. Ethyl acetate was added at a ratio of 2:1 by volume and centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 5 min. After adding toluene to dissolve the precipitate, it was centrifuged again and finally, the precipitate was dissolved in n-hexane.
Device fabrication
9 mm2 ITO coated glass substrates were sequentially cleaned with detergent, deionised water, acetone and ethanol by ultrasonication for 10 min and then dried at 120 °C. Then, those substrates were treated with oxygen plasma for 30 min. The PEDOT:PSS solution was filtered through a 0.45 μL filter and was spin-coated on patterned ITO/glass substrates at 4000 rpm for 40 s, the PEDOT:PSS films were annealed under three conditions (air, toluene and EG vapour). After that, PTAA was dissolved in chlorobenzene solvent with a concentration of 8 mg mL−1 and was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 40 s, at a temperature at 120 °C for 15 min. Then, CsPbBr3 QDs were spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 40 s. TPBi, LiF and Al were thermally vapour deposited at 40, 1 and 100 nm, respectively, under a vacuum of 1 × 10−4 pa.
Characterizations
The surface roughness of PEDOT:PSS films was tested using AFM (MFP-3D-BIO). The conductivities of dried PEDOT:PSS films were measured using the van der Pauw four-point probe technique with a Keithley 2400 source/meter. Indium was pressed on the four corners of each PEDOT:PSS film on the glass substrate for the electrical contact. The contact angle was measured using the JY-82 instrument. Qualitative analysis of the chemical state of the elements on the surface of the films was performed using XPS (ESCALAB250Xi). Raman spectroscopy was performed using the LabRAM HR instrument to test the chemical structure of PEDOT:PSS. The work function of PEDOT:PSS films was tested using the ESCALAB250Xi instrument for ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Crystallinity characterisation, microstructure evaluation and photoluminescence spectroscopy of CsPbBr3 were performed using powder diffractometry (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å, at 36 kV and 20 mA), TEM (ZEISS LIBRA200FE microscope) and an FLS920 spectrofluorometer, respectively. The EL characteristics were collected using a Keithley 2450 source and a Photo Research Spectra Scan spectrometer PR670 working in air without encapsulation.
Results and discussion
As mentioned in the experimental section, PEDOT:PSS films were prepared by spin coating and annealed under three different processes (Fig. 1). Typically, for air-annealed samples, the spin-casted PEDOT:PSS thin film was typically annealed under ambient condition at 120 °C for 25 min. For the toluene vapor-annealed sample, the PEDOT:PSS film was transferred into a glass Petri dish on a hot plate, and 200 μL of toluene was added inside the Petri dish, and then, the substrate was annealed inside the covered Petri dish at 120 °C for 25 min. It has been illustrated that toluene has a dielectric constant of 2.38 and a boiling point of 111 °C. At 120 °C, when annealing the PEDOT:PSS film with toluene vapors, toluene molecules can interact with PEDOT:PSS, causing its semiconductor properties to change. While EG presents a high dielectric constant of 37 and superior hydrophilic properties. For the EG-washed sample, EG was spin-coated on an air-annealed PEDOT:PSS film at 5000 rpm for 60 s and then annealed at 120 °C for another 10 min, thus, excess PSS could be removed from its surface. Besides, due to the boiling point of EG at 197 °C, hydrophilic EG molecules stay in the film longer than the water molecules during the second annealing process and induce the separation of PSS and PEDOT domains.28,29

The electrical conductivities of PEDOT:PSS films after air annealing, toluene vapour annealing and EG-washing were measured using the van der Pauw four-point probe technique with a Keithley 2400 source. As shown in Fig. 2a, the conductivity of the pristine PEDOT:PSS film is only about 0.13 S cm−1. After treating with toluene, the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film is increased to 1.25 S cm−1, which is about a 10 order increase. Especially, the modification with EG treatment gives rise to a conductivity of 10.52 S cm−1. After annealing with toluene vapors, the conductive PEDOT chains are rearranged with enhanced linkage interactions, resulting in a higher-order laminar structure.28 This ordering effect increases the number of polaritons (bipolarons) and thus increases the carrier concentration in PEDOT:PSS films. PEDOT chains store charge in the form of polarons/bipolarons, and both polarons and bipolarons propagate current along the polymer chains.30 Therefore, the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films increases. For the EG cleaning, a part of the insulating PSS from the surface of the PEDOT:PSS film is removed, thus the electrical conductivity is improved. The conductivity is enhanced by 80 orders of magnitude. In order to investigate the changes in the surface properties of PEDOT:PSS films under different annealing treatments, water contact angle measurements were performed on the films. The significant difference in hydrophobicity between PEDOT and PSS makes the measurement of the water contact angle on the PEDOT:PSS surface a rapid method of detecting changes in the relative amounts of PEDOT and PSS on the surface. As clearly depicted in Fig. 2b, with no UV or oxygen plasma treatment, the pristine PEDOT:PSS film shows a relatively small water contact angle of 21.5°, demonstrating that the surface is mainly occupied by the hydrophilic PSS. While the water contact angles of toluene treated and EG-washed PEDOT:PSS films are 42.5° and 34.8°, respectively, suggesting that more hydrophobic PEDOT chains segregate to the film surface and PSS is partly removed. Fig. 2c–e shows atomic force microscopic (AFM) images of the pristine film and after treatment with toluene and EG. The obtained air-annealed PEDOT:PSS film shows a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of 0.9 nm. The resulting toluene treated PEDOT:PSS film is slightly rough with an RMS roughness value of 1.06 nm, demonstrating its potential use in the fabrication of LED devices. Whereas, the observed increase in RMS value for the EG-washed PEDOT:PSS film is 2.11 nm, remarkably higher than that of PEDOT:PSS after air annealing, indicating that EG may remove part of the surface PSS31,32 and is not conducive to subsequent perovskite spin coating.

The removal of some PSS chains from the PEDOT:PSS film after toluene vapor annealing and EG-washing was confirmed from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study. The wide XPS spectra of the PEDOT:PSS films are shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI† and Fig. 3a–c show the typical S 2p spectra of the PEDOT:PSS film annealed following the three different methods. The sulfur atom signal of PSS appears at high binding energy between 166 and 172 eV. While the binding energies between 162 and 166 eV originate from the sulfur atoms of PEDOT.33,34 It was seen that the ratios of PEDOT/PSS after toluene vapor annealing and EG-washing increased from 0.65 to 0.66 and 0.79, respectively, indicating that the toluene vapor-annealing process has a little effect on removing PSS. In contrast, the surface PSS can be effectively reduced by 18% by the EG-washed PEDOT:PSS film. Partial removal of the surface insulating part PSS can promote the contact of the conductive part and facilitate the extraction of electric charges. The result is in accordance with our conductivity measurements.

It has been demonstrated that the PEDOT chain has a quinone structure and a benzoic acid structure in the oxidized state,35 as shown in Fig. 4a. The chemical state and structure of PEDOT in the PEDOT:PSS film with different annealed processes were characterized using Raman spectroscopy, and the obtained spectra between 1300 cm−1 and 1700 cm−1 are shown in Fig. 4b–d and Fig. S2 in the ESI.† The most compact bands centered at 1366, 1440 and 1504 cm−1 are corresponding to CαCα inter-ring stretching vibrations, CαCβ symmetrical vibrations, and CαCβ asymmetrical vibrations, respectively.36,37 Particularly, the peak located at 1440 cm−1 can be deconvoluted into two separate bands, consisting of the quinoid vibration at 1414 cm−1 and the benzenoid vibration at 1445 cm−1. We can calculate the ratio of quinones to benzoate (Q/B) from these peak areas. Without post-treatment, such a PEDOT:PSS film shows a Q/B ratio of 0.14. Whereas the toluene-treated PEDOT:PSS film shows a Q/B ratio of 0.2, which is higher than the air-treated one. This result indicates that toluene treatment can help change the PEDOT chain from a more coil-like benzoic acid structure to a more linear or extended quinone structure, which is conducive to hole transportation. On the contrary, it is interesting to note that the Q/B ratio is maintained at 0.14 for the EG-washed PEDOT:PSS film, demonstrating that the presence of EG hardly affects the PEDOT structure. The reason for this phenomenon may be a shot contact time between EG and the PEDOT:PSS film during spin coating.

The morphology of CsPbBr3 QDs synthesized via ligand-assisted super-saturated recrystallization was characterised using the transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM). As shown in Fig. 5a, QDs exhibit a cubic morphology with uniform dimensions and an average crystal size of 10 nm. The inset in Fig. 5a shows that the lattice spacing of individual grains is 0.58 nm, corresponding to the (100) plane of the cubic CsPbBr3 perovskite phase. The cubic structure characteristic of CsPbBr3 QDs was further confirmed from the XRD pattern shown in Fig. 5b. The peaks located at 14.8°, 21.1°, 30.4°, 34.0°, 37.4° and 43.4° correspond to reflections from the (100), (110), (200), (201), (211) and (202) crystal planes of the cubic phase structure, respectively. The photoluminescence spectrum of the CsPbBr3 QDs solution obtained under light excitation at 365 nm is shown in Fig. 5c (blue line). The fluorescence emission was observed to have a highly symmetrical emission peak with a peak concentration at 515 nm and a full width at half maximum of 20 nm, possessing great color purity. The UV-vis absorption spectrum is also shown in Fig. 5c (green line) and the absorption edge is located at around 525 nm. The optical bandgap is thus estimated to be ∼2.36 eV. The inset of Fig. 5c displays the bright green emission of the CsPbBr3 QDs under 365 nm UV excitation. The photoluminescence quantum yield of the QDs reached 80.34% and the PL decay lifetime was 7.13 ns, as shown in Fig. 5d. The obtained PLQY values of the CsPbBr3 QDs on PEDOT:PSS with air, toluene and EG-annealing processes were 39.96%, 37.44% and 37.82% (Fig. S3, ESI†), respectively, which suggests no difference for CsPbBr3 QDs. It is well known that the method of QD surface passivation technology can increase the radiative recombination rate, thus, PLQY of QDs is increased.38 In this work, CsPbBr3 QDs were modified with the unified method. Therefore, the obtained PLQY values are almost the same. In addition, the CsPbBr3 QDs were spin-coating on the PTAA layer, rather than directly spin-coating on the PEDOT:PSS film. The reasons can be concluded that (i) the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of PEDOT:PSS is far below that of the perovskite layer, which leads to inferior hole injection and exciton recombination;39 (ii) the degradation of perovskite films induced by the acidity and hygroscopicity of PEDOT:PSS results in QLED with a poor environmental and operational stability.40 One effective solution to the above problems is to insert one hole transport layer (for example, PTAA in this work) between PEDOT:PSS and the CsPbBr3 QD-layer. The PTAA layer can provide an appropriate HOMO energy level, thus, the hole injection is enhanced. All the characterization analysis demonstrated the advantages for the fabrication of perovskite QLED devices.

Having prepared and investigated PEDOT:PSS films and CsPbBr3 QDs, electroluminescence (EL) QLED devices were fabricated. The schematic of the device and energy levels are shown in Fig. 6, the energy levels associated with all other materials were obtained from the literature.27 The QLED device consists of the following layers: glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/PTAA (30 nm)/CsPbBr3 QDs/TPBi (40 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm), where PEDOT:PSS takes the role of the hole injection layer and hole transport layer; PTAA acts as the hole transport layer; TPBi is responsible for the electron transport layer; LiF serves as the cathode buffer layer, ITO and Al layers are the anode and cathode, respectively.

Fig. 7a shows the normalized EL spectra of the three devices with different HTL annealing processes. Noted that no changes for the position and half-peak width of EL spectra of the three devices appeared, indicating that the treatment of the PEDOT:PSS film has no effect on the EL spectrum and the injected holes and electrons appropriately converted to excitons within CsPbBr3 QDs. EL spectra of toluene vapor annealed QLED devices at different voltages were also measured, and the spectra displayed no shift with an increase in the voltage as shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI.†Fig. 7b and c demonstrates the current–density–voltage and luminance–voltage characteristics of the as-prepared CsPbBr3 QLED devices. It was observed that for the voltage <4 V, the current density of the EG-washed QLED device was higher than that of the other two devices. This phenomenon can be explained based on the fact that EG cleaning can remove the surface part of the PSS, making the PEDOT conductive part directly in contact with the next layer of the interface, which is conducive to charge extraction. When the voltage is beyond 4 V, the current density increases obviously for the toluene-treated QLED. The improved current density of the toluene-treated device can be attributed to the change of the PEDOT chain structure, which improves the cavity injection capacity. As can be clearly observed from the L–V characteristics in Fig. 7c, all three devices display the same turn-on voltage (Vt) of 2.5 V at 1 cd m−2. To the best of our knowledge, these driving voltage characteristics of the QLEDs are considerably lower than those previously reported for green perovskite QLEDs.41 Additional measurements on the work function of PEDOT:PSS films treated with air, toluene and EG were performed. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the calculated values of PEDOT:PSS films after air, toluene and EG treatment were 6.1 eV, 5.93 eV and 5.79 eV, respectively. Based on the valence band maximum of 6.0 eV for QDs, only 0.07/0.01 eV, the difference for the air/toluene treated PEDOT:PSS film and the small difference between QDs and air/toluene treated PEDOT:PSS film makes them show the same turn-on voltage (2.5 V). While, compared with valence band maximum of QDs, the EG-treated PEDOT:PSS film displays 0.21 eV difference, which is slightly higher than that compared with the air/toluene treated PEDOT:PSS film. Therefore, a relatively large turn-on voltage for the QLED device based on the EG-treated PEDOT:PSS film is obtained. Especially, the luminance of the toluene-treated device increases significantly with increasing current density. The maximum luminance of 31140 cd m−2 is reached for the toluene-treated device at a driving voltage of 5.6 V, which enhances nearly 48% than that of the untreated device (20980 cd m−2). Unfortunately, the maximum brightness of the QLED device with EG cleaned PEDOT:PSS as HTL is only 14060 cd m−2, which is lower than the brightness of the untreated device. The decreased performance can be attributed to the hydrophobicity of EG treated PEDOT:PSS, which is adverse to spin-coating of QDs and, therefore, affect the performance of the device. From the photograph of the working QLED device recorded at 100 mA cm−2, a very bright green emission can be observed, as shown in the inset of Fig. 7c.

The power efficiency as a function of voltage and EQE as a function of current density are displayed in Fig. 7d and Fig. S6 (ESI†), respectively. The perovskite QLED device using toluene vapor annealing PEDOT:PSS film shows a maximum power efficiency of 13.4 lm W−1. Control devices fabricated using the untreated and EG cleaned PEDOT:PSS film showed power efficiencies of 10.7 lm W−1 and 6.7 lm W−1, respectively, which are lower than that for the QLED fabricated toluene-treated PEDOT:PSS. We can see that these results agree quite well with the other experimental results (Table 1 and Fig. 7). Current efficiency as a function of voltage is demonstrated in Fig. 7e. The maximum current efficiency of 16.6 cd A−1 was obtained for the toluene-treated QLED, a 16% increase from the original QLED (14.3 cd A−1). Whereas, the maximum current efficiency decrease to 9.48 cd A−1 for the EG-treated device, a 33.7% decrease from the original QLED. This indicates that the toluene-treated PEDOT:PSS film enabled charge transport in the high current density region. These results indicated that toluene-treated PEDOT:PSS promoted the capacity of charge injection, due to the PEDOT chain changing from a more coil-like benzoic acid structure to a more linear or extended quinone structure, thus, improving its hole transport characteristic. Besides, the Commission International de l’Eclairage (CIE) color is measured with a chromaticity coordinate of (0.09, 0.76) (Fig. 7f), making the emission possible spectrum has appeal as a component for display technology and lighting applications. Notably, the CIE point has an outstanding color purity of 85.2%, which gives a higher advantage of the perovskite QLED than commercial LEDs, for example, color purity of 84% for Luminus SBT-70 G. Besides, we have summarized the performance of QLEDs based on CsPbBr3 perovskite QDs for the past six years, as shown in Table S1 (ESI†), although the EQE of the obtained QLED devices was not as high as that reported in other literature, the luminance of the devices reached a relatively high level. In particular, in this work, the main focus is to improve the performance of QLED devices by modifying the hole transport layer, which is innovative for this work.

The stability of the as-fabricated QLED devices was studied. Fig. S7a (ESI†) shows the normalized luminance of QLEDs with all three methods of processing PEDOT:PSS films versus the run-time at a continuous bias of 6 V. We monitored the attenuation of the emitted intensity of the unencapsulated devices at different running times under ambient air conditions and recorded the emitted intensity intermittently at 5 minute intervals. Unfortunately, the stabilities were hardly enhanced for both the toluene and EG-treated PEDOT:PSS based QLED devices. The reason for this result can be ascribed to the instability of perovskite QDs. Fig. S7b (ESI†) shows the photographs of the toluene vapor annealed PEDOT:PSS films as HTL devices after different running times (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min), and a slight trend of diminishing emission intensity can be seen. The reason for the appearance of black spots may come from two sources. (i) The Joule heat generated by the high current density driven by a voltage of 6 V is likely to make the bond between the electron transport layer and the surface of the Al electrode debond due to the mismatch of the thermal expansion coefficient,42 and that part of the electron transport layer (black line) is not covered by the Al electrode and the electrons in it do not enter the emitting layer to combine with the holes. (ii) Water in the air reacts with Al to change its conductivity from a state where electrons can be injected to a state where they cannot be injected, and the part that cannot be injected will no longer emit light.43
Conclusions
In summary, surface-treatment of PEDOT:PSS with polar and nonpolar solvents has been proposed as a simple and effective method to enhance the performance of perovskite QLED devices. The electrical properties, surface morphology, composition and structure of the PEDOT:PSS film after treatment with air, toluene and EG were systematically investigated. Because the EG-washed process removes excess PSS from the PEDOT:PSS surface and is not conducive to the subsequent spin-coating QD layer. The CsPbBr3 QLED fabricated with the EG-washed PEDOT:PSS film results in a 43.5% and 50% decrease in luminance and power efficiency, respectively, compared to the control device. With improved conductivity, morphology, as well as the treatment of the chemical structure of the PEDOT:PSS film with toluene, a turn-on voltage of 2.5 V, and the maximum luminance of 31140 cd m−2 and a power efficiency of 13.4 lm W−1, were achieved for the perovskite QLED device. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the conductivity enhancement of PEDOT:PSS films were applied to the perovskite QLED device and provided a new route for the development of their performance.
