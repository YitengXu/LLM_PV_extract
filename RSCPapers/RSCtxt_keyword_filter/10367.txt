    , Accepted 18th May 2023First published on 18th May 2023AbstractElectron transport layers (ETLs) used as components of photocathodes for light-driven CO2 reduction (CO2R) in aqueous media should have good electronic transport, be stable under CO2R conditions, and, ideally, be catalytically inert for the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, using planar p-Si (100) as the absorbing material, we show that TaOx satisfies all three of the above criteria. TaOx films were synthesized by both pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and radio-frequency (RF) sputtering. In both cases, careful control of the oxygen partial pressure during growth was required to produce ETLs with acceptable electron conductivity. p-Si/TaOx photocathodes were interfaced with ca. 10 nm of a CO2R catalyst: Cu or Au. Under front illumination with simulated AM 1.5G in CO2-saturated bicarbonate buffer, we observed, for both metals, faradaic efficiencies for CO2R products of ∼50% and ∼30% for PLD TaOx and RF sputtered TaOx, respectively, at photocurrent densities up to 8 mA cm−2. p-Si/TiO2/Cu photocathodes were also evaluated but produced mostly H2 (>97%) due to reduction of the TiO2 to Ti metal under CO2R conditions. In contrast, a dual ETL photocathode (p-Si/TiO2/TaOx/Cu) was selective for CO2R, which suggests a strategy for separately optimizing selective charge collection and the stability of the ETL/water interface. The maximum photovoltage obtained with p-Si/TaOx/Cu devices was 300 mV which was increased to 430–460 mV by employing ion implantation to make pn+-Si/TaOx/Cu structures. Photocathodes with RF sputtered TaOx ETLs are stable for CO2R for at least 300 min. Techno-economic analysis shows that the reported system, if scaled, could allow for an economically viable production of feedstocks for chemical synthesis under the adoption of specific CO2 credit schemes, thus becoming a significant component of carbon-neutral manufacturing.
Introduction
Charge selective contacts (CSCs) provide the asymmetry necessary for light to electrical power conversion in photovoltaic (PV) solar cells.1 For this reason, in silicon PVs there is significant research focus and progress on engineering CSCs that provide both efficient charge collection and interface passivation.2–5 Energy conversion with photoelectrochemical (PEC) devices operates on the same principle: the surfaces of photocathodes must be selective for electrons and the surface of photoanodes must be selective for holes. While some materials, notably metal oxides used as photoanodes for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), provide charge selectivity via their intrinsic catalytic activity for the desired reaction, engineered surface layers are also widely employed.6,7
For PEC electrodes, in addition to charge carrier selectivity, there are two additional constraints for CSCs. First, the CSC must be stable in the electrochemical environment (often either a strong base or acid) so that it can serve as a “protection” layer for the photoabsorber if it is a kinetically or thermodynamically unstable material during operation.8 Further, the CSC either by itself or in combination with a co-catalyst must provide selectivity to the desired reaction, for instance the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER) or CO2 reduction (CO2R). Additionally, for the case of PEC CO2R, since both the HER and CO2R are thermodynamically possible, the CSC or, more specifically, the electron transport layer (ETL) in combination with a co-catalyst must be selective to CO2R products rather than the HER.
There are numerous experimental reports which utilize a Si/ETL/co-catalyst stack to form photocathodes for the HER.9–11 TiO2 and either Pt or Ru are typical choices for the ETL and HER catalyst, respectively. To make a photocathode which will instead reduce CO2, the co-catalyst should be replaced with a metal which is more active for CO2R than for the HER.12,13 For instance, Au has been reported to drive CO2R more selectively towards CO,14 Bi towards formate,15,16 and Cu towards C–C coupled products like C2H4.13,17 However, there are comparatively fewer reports on the functioning of these catalysts when integrated with CO2R photocathodes. Hinogami et al.18 interfaced p-Si with Cu, Ag, and Au without any ETL and found faradaic efficiencies (FEs) of up to ca. 30% for formate and methane for Cu and up to 50% for CO for Ag. Qiu et al.19 reported a p-InP/TiO2/Cu photocathode which, intriguingly, produced methanol at ca. 5% FE. Gurudayal et al.20 reported a Si photocathode with a TiO2 ETL and Cu–Ag bimetallic catalyst which exhibited 80% selectivity for C2+ products. However, in this case, the thick catalyst layer was optically opaque so that illumination from the back (dry) side was employed.
It thus remains an unmet challenge to make a selective CO2R photocathode capable of front (wet) side illumination. Having an optically thin co-catalyst layer would minimize the photoelectrode cost and allow for the photocathode to be illuminated from the front side (wet side).21 This would be particularly advantageous when employing low-cost light absorbers with short minority carrier diffusion lengths. In our initial attempts to make such a device, we used p-Si/TiO2 interfaced with Cu and Ag. However, under operation, the TiO2 was reduced to Ti metal, which then dominates the catalytic activity and produces H2 (FE > 97%).
We then examined the Si PV literature to find an oxide ETL which would be more stable than TiO2; TaOx appeared promising. When interfaced to Si, it has a small conduction band offset (desirable for electron collection) and large valence band offset (desirable for hole blocking) and is reported to passivate surface states.22–24 Si PV cells incorporating an n-Si/TaOx heterocontact have been reported to have up to 19% power conversion efficiency.22 TaOx has also been used as an ETL for photocathodes. Wang et al.25 reported that a pn+-Si/Ta2O5/Pt photocathode was stable for over 200 hours while generating H2. Riyajuddin et al.26 reported 10 hours of stability under HER conditions for a Si nanowire/Ta2O5/N-doped graphene quantum dot photocathode.
The prior PV and PEC HER work with TaOx suggests that it may be a good candidate for an ETL for PEC CO2R devices. Moreover, examination of its Pourbaix diagram under typical CO2 reduction (CO2R) conditions (−1 V vs. SHE and pH 7) predicts that it will be stable.27,28 There is also considerable synthesis flexibility. TaOx thin films have been prepared by a variety of techniques like pulsed laser deposition (PLD),29 RF sputtering30 and atomic layer deposition (ALD)31 and their electronic conductivity can be tuned (from insulating to semiconducting) by controlling the concentration of oxygen vacancies.32
These considerations motivated us to study p-Si/TaOx photocathodes interfaced with thin (optically transparent) metal CO2R catalysts (p-Si/TaOx/Cu). We synthesized TaOx thin films using pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and reactive radio frequency (RF) sputtering techniques. Stoichiometric Ta2O5 films had poor electronic transport which was improved by controlling the oxygen partial pressure during deposition. Under simulated AM 1.5G illumination, the TaOx ETL-based Si photocathodes (synthesized by both PLD and RF sputtering) had good selectivity to CO2R products, ∼50% and ∼30% respectively, which we attribute to the stability and inertness of the TaOx. Using ion-implanted contacts onto silicon photocathodes with TaOx ETLs higher photovoltages were obtained (p-Si/n+/TaOx/Cu ∼ 430 mV and p+/n-Si/n+/TaOx/Cu ∼ 460 mV) when compared to the p-Si/TaOx junction (∼300 mV). We found that the photocathodes were quite sensitive to contamination from metal crossover from the anode due to the small catalyst loading needed for optical transparency and that this could be mitigated by using a non-noble metal counter electrode (graphite). We identify stability as a key challenge for this type of solar-to-chemical energy conversion approach and provide scale-up scenarios informed by a techno-economic analysis.
Results and discussion
TiO2 as an ETL for CO2R Si photocathodes with a thin Cu catalyst
In the initial work, we investigated the CO2R product distribution of a p-Si photocathode with an atomic layer deposition (ALD) TiO2 as an ETL and a thin 10 nm Cu co-catalyst. PEC measurements were performed in 0.1 M KHCO3 electrolyte under 1 sun illumination for Si photocathodes (these conditions were used throughout the study, see the Detailed Methods section in the ESI†). Such a photocathode shows a photocurrent onset at ∼−0.05 V vs. RHE and a photocurrent density of ∼12 mA cm−2 at −1 V vs. RHE (Fig. 1a). However, the expected products from CO2R on Cu are not observed. Instead, the major product is H2 (FE > 97%, Fig. 1b).

We hypothesized that the H2 formation was due to the activity of Ti metal, which is known to be active for the HER.13 Indeed, we see experimental evidence that when TiO2 is in contact with the electrolyte (0.1 M KHCO3) under CO2R conditions, it is reduced to Ti metal as evidenced by the prominent Ti0 peak in the Ti 2p core level spectra after operation (Fig. 1c). Before CO2R operation the TiO2 was completely covered by the Cu catalyst as evidenced by the absence of Ti XPS peaks (Fig. S2†). However, during CO2R operation, the TiO2 layer was gradually exposed to the electrolyte as evidenced by the observation of Ti XPS peaks after operation (Fig. 1c). Evidently, the HER activity on the Ti outcompetes CO2R on the Cu, which remains unmodified after operation (Fig. 1d).
We investigated the effect of increasing the thickness of the Cu layer, understanding that this will eventually limit the photocurrent density in the front illumination geometry which we employed. Upon increasing the Cu thickness to 15 nm (Fig. S3(a)†), we observed a marginal improvement with CO2R FEs of ca. 10%. Further increases in the metal thickness would be expected to greatly reduce the photocurrent (Fig. S3(b)†). We concluded that TiO2 is not a suitable ETL for CO2R photocathodes operated under the conditions we have employed and thus explored TaOx as an alternative.
Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) grown TaOx as an ETL for p-Si CO2R photocathodes
Next, we synthesized TaOx films on p-Si by PLD using a stoichiometric Ta2O5 target (details in the ESI†). Substoichiometric Ta2O5 has been reported to exhibit higher electronic conductivity than more stoichiometric material due to the presence of oxygen vacancies.33 Therefore, different O2 flow rates were employed in the PLD chamber as shown schematically in Fig. 2(a). We denote TaOx grown by PLD on p-Si with 0.1 sccm, 0.3 sccm and 1.6 sccm oxygen flow as TaOx-0.1, TaOx-0.3 and TaOx-1.6. As expected from prior reports on PLD-grown TaOx without any annealing step,34 XRD patterns (Fig. S4†) were featureless, indicating that the films are amorphous.

Chemical composition was evaluated with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). We assign the doublet peak observed at 28.3/26.4 eV for all films (Fig. 2(b)) to Ta 4f7/2 and Ta 4f5/2 from the Ta5+ oxidation state.35 A notable feature of the Ta 4f spectra is the presence of a shoulder peak at between 25 eV and 23 eV which decreases with increasing O2 flow rate in the PLD chamber. We assign this feature to sub-oxides of Ta which are expected to be formed in substoichiometric Ta2O5 films.36
Higher flow rates of O2 (1.6 sccm) yielded a more stoichiometric Ta2O5 film as evidenced by the absence of suboxides of tantalum oxide. Fig. 2(c) shows the deconvolution of the Ta 4f spectra of TaOx-0.3. Focusing on the shoulder at lower binding energy, the peaks at 26.4 eV and 24.5 eV are attributed to the Ta3+ oxidation state.30,37 The O 1s spectrum was fitted with two Gaussian components with peaks at 530.9 eV and 532 eV which would correspond to Ta–O binding and surface contaminations/peroxide O22− (Fig. S5†).22,35 No obvious difference was observed for the O 1s spectra for the different O2 flow rates of the TaOx films (Fig. 2(d)) with the peak position of the Ta–O binding remaining the same for all thin films. Our XPS results show that the stoichiometry of TaOx could be controlled by varying the O2 flow rate in the PLD chamber.
Next, we fabricated p-Si photocathodes with the PLD-grown TaOx as the ETL and a Cu co-catalyst. We chose a Cu catalyst thickness of 10 nm due to higher CO2R product yield and higher photocurrent density (despite having lower transmission of light to the photocathode than a 5 nm thick Cu co-catalyst) (Fig. S6–S8†). Si photocathodes with a TaOx-0.3 ETL exhibited the highest photocurrent density under CO2R conditions reaching a maximum photocurrent density of ∼7 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3(a)). The photocurrent density of TaOx-1.6 was lower than the TaOx-0.3 due to its higher resistivity as a result of a higher oxygen partial pressure during the PLD growth.32,37 This was verified by performing ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements to obtain the valence band spectra of TaOx (Fig. 3(b)). It is evident that the defect band in the band gap of TaOx increases with reduced oxygen partial pressure confirming the increase of oxygen vacancies for PLD TaOx grown with a 0.3 sccm O2 flow rate. The p-Si/TaOx/Cu-10 nm based photocathode produced nearly 52% CO2R products at a bias of −1.2 V vs. RHE while a p-Si/TiO2 photocathode with the same Cu co-catalyst thickness yielded only H2 (Fig. 4(a)) despite its earlier photocurrent onset and higher photocurrent density (Fig. S9†).

To evaluate the compatibility of TaOx with other CO2R catalysts, an Au catalyst was employed to evaluate the CO2R product distribution. A Ta underlayer was used for the Au catalyst to improve its adhesion to TaOx. The photocurrent density obtained was similar to that of p-Si/TaOx/Cu (Fig. S10†) and the CO2R products obtained were primarily C1 products (CO and HCOO−) as expected for an Au catalyst (Fig. 4(b)). Based on these results, TaOx could be employed as an ETL for p-Si interfaced with both Cu and Au co-catalysts for CO2R.
Reactive radio-frequency (RF) sputtered TaOx as an ETL for the CO2R Si photocathode
Photocathodes were made with TaOx deposited by reactive RF sputtering, which is a more scalable technique than PLD (experimental details in the ESI†). A Ta metal target was used and the Ar:O2 ratio in the chamber was used for oxygen substoichiometry of TaOx. Fig. 5(a) shows the Ta 4f spectra for the TaOx films prepared with 2 different Ar:O2 ratios. Similar to the PLD-prepared TaOx films (compare Fig. 2(b)), the doublet peaks for the Ta5+ oxidation state are dominant. However, the film made with a lower O2 partial pressure (99:1 Ar:O2) exhibits a significant peak corresponding to Ta metal suggesting that not all the Ta metal has been oxidized to the +5 oxidation state.

Next, the photoelectrochemical performance of the p-Si/TaOx (RF sputtered)/Cu photocathodes was evaluated under the same CO2R conditions as p-Si/TaOx (PLD grown)/Cu photocathodes. Photocathodes fabricated using RF sputtered TaOx had a very smooth surface after deposition of the Cu catalyst (Fig. S11†) and their XRD patterns only exhibited peaks corresponding to Si (Fig. S12†). The photocathode with higher oxygen content (TaOx 97:3) yielded a marginally higher photocurrent and lower dark current as there is no Ta metal in the film when compared to TaOx (99:1) (Fig. 5(b)). Variation of the TaOx thickness showed that photocathodes with 20 nm TaOx yielded better fill factors and photocurrent density despite exhibiting similar substoichiometry (Fig. S13 and S14†). If the TaOx thickness is too thick as in the case of 40 nm then the photocurrent density is lowered probably due to increased series resistance and if the thickness is below 20 nm then the coverage of TaOx on Si is not uniform. Hence, a thickness of 20 nm of TaOx under 97:3 Ar to O2 conditions was found to be optimum. Upon comparing the champion device of sputtering (TaOx (97:3)) with the PLD champion device (TaOx-0.3), the sputtering champion device exhibited an earlier photocurrent onset but a marginally lower photocurrent density (Fig. S15†). This could be attributed to an increase in the substoichiometry of TaOx films prepared by sputtering (Fig. S16†).
Si photocathode with a dual ETL
A dual ETL approach has shown promise in water splitting where one ETL serves as an n-type junction layer and the other performs the role of protection and catalyst support.38 Since TiO2 has a better band alignment with p-Si, we used it as the primary ETL and sputtered TaOx on it to take advantage of its higher CO2R product yield and stability. The photocurrent onset and the photocurrent density of such a dual ETL photocathode are lower in comparison to the Si–TiO2/Cu layer (Fig. 6(a)). But the dual ETL photocathode produced more CO2R products than Si–TiO2–Cu as the TiO2 is buried under TaOx. Since the TiO2 layer is not fully exposed to the electrolyte under CO2R conditions, HER activity is suppressed and the catalytic activity could be dominated by the TaOx/Cu layer (Fig. 6(b)). The dual ETL device was able to combine the earlier photocurrent onset of the p-Si/TiO2/Cu device with the higher CO2R product selectivity of the p-Si/TaOx/Cu device. The partial current densities towards CO2R products (CO, CH4, C2H4 and HCOO−) for the dual ETL photocathode were only marginally lower than those of the p-Si–TaOx–Cu photocathode at −1.0 V vs. RHE (Fig. S17†). Having a dual ETL approach would enable photocathode designs where the photovoltage could be improved by employing an n-type layer which has a good band alignment with the underlying p-type absorber and simultaneously taking advantage of TaOx/Cu's stability and higher yield of CO2R products.

Photovoltage
Finally, we fabricated an n+Si/TaOx (97:3)/Cu dark cathode (black curve in Fig. 7) so that we can compare the onset of the dark catalytic current to the photocurrent onset of a p-Si/TaOx/Cu photocathode (Fig. 7(a)). There are no reports in the literature to the best of our knowledge where p-Si is directly interfaced with TaOx to form the p–n junction which gives a photovoltage. Instead, most reports in the photovoltaic literature employ n-Si with TaOx as a surface passivation/electron selective contact.22 In this work, a photovoltage of ∼300 mV was obtained for p-Si/TaOx junctions with a Cu CO2R catalyst (Fig. 7(a) and S18(a)†). To improve the photovoltage of these photocathodes, an n+ implant of p-Si wafers was performed to yield a better-quality junction with RF sputtered TaOx onto the p-Si/n+ with a Cu catalyst. This photocathode yielded a higher photovoltage of 430 mV (Fig. 7(b) and S18(b)†). Both photovoltage and photocurrent density were increased when a silicon photocathode (n-Si with n+ and p+ implanted contacts20) was employed with an RF-sputtered TaOx ETL and Cu catalyst (Fig. 7(c) and S18(c)†) showing the broad applicability of RF-sputtered TaOx as an ETL for photocathodes.

Long-term stability of p-Si/TaOx/Cu photocathodes
The long-term stability of p-Si/TaOx/Cu photocathodes over a period of 300 min was evaluated by the time evolution of CO2R gaseous products (Fig. S19†). Samples with RF sputtered TaOx were chosen as it is a more scalable synthesis technique than PLD and has higher potential for commercialization. The surface of the photocathode became more rougher after the long-term CO2R electrolysis (Fig. S20†). A fairly stable evolution of CO2R products was observed for at least for a period of 120 min after which the faradaic efficiencies for the CO2R products decreased. The electrolyte was changed after 225 min when no ethylene production was observed. Although there was a decrease in the Cu signal from XPS after operation (Fig. S21†), the lack of ethylene production could not be just attributed to the loss of the Cu catalyst. After CO2R photoelectrolysis, contact angle measurements were performed to investigate the hydrophobicity of the photocathode and it was observed that the surface of the photocathode (TaOx/Cu) became more hydrophilic after CO2R (Fig. S22†). In the CO2R electrolysis literature, the change in hydrophobicity has been attributed to minor CO2R product polymerization (acrolein to polyacrylic acid) on the surface of the Cu catalyst.39 It is conceivable that this effect is occurring here, as well. In stability tests, we used a Pt counter electrode but found that Pt migration to the PEC surface strongly affected the results which are mitigated by using a graphite counter electrode (see discussion in the ESI†).
Using a graphite counter electrode resulted in continued ethylene production even after 300 min of operation (and good photocurrent stability Fig. S23†) when compared to a Pt counter electrode which required a change of electrolyte after 225 min in order to sustain ethylene production (Fig. 8(a)). Further no Pt 4f peak (71 eV) was observed on the photocathode surface after 5 hours of operation when employing a graphite counter electrode (Fig. S24†). The surface of p-Si/TaOx/Cu after operation was still hydrophilic (same as the case with the Pt counter electrode) hinting that the long-term stability of the photocathode was not significantly affected by the change in hydrophobicity of the surface but rather the crossover of Pt from the counter electrode was the main reason for decreased C2H4 production (Fig. 8(b) and (c)).

Techno-economic analysis of the Si–TaOx–Cu photocathode
The selectivity of the Si–TaOx–Cu photocathode towards carbon-containing products incentivized to conceptually design a large-scale photocatalytic system that could be used for production of carbon-rich gas streams from abundant, biogenic CO2 (Fig. 9(a)). One of the anticipated bottlenecks towards the deployment of CO2-based systems is the low concentration of CO2 in the ambient air.40 The availability of CO2 in oceans is significantly higher.41 We thus conceptualized a system where ocean water, a source of preconcentrated CO2, circulates through photoelectrochemical systems, and CO2 is converted into a stream of ethylene, carbon monoxide, methane, and hydrogen, being a useful input to various chemical manufacturing processes.42 Such a system would require a minimum input of renewable electricity sourced from solar panels or windmills, as a significant amount of energy is being supplied via direct sunlight irradiation.
 Fig. 9  Conceptualized scale-up and techno-economic analysis (TEA) of systems incorporating Si/TaOx/Cu photocathodes: (a) concept of biogenic CO2-based manufacturing systems, (b) manufacturing cost for Si/TaOx/Cu photocathodes based on pilot-plant/semi-industrial scale coefficient for energy and gases used during the PVD process and (c) sensitivity analysis for the return on investment for the entire photoelectrochemical system, as a function of renewable electricity price and imposed credit for avoided CO2 emissions. Grey area depicts scenarios which are not economically viable. Methodology details are given in the ESI.† 
Looking towards this large-scale scenario, we sought to understand whether the proposed catalyst deposition method could be effectively scaled up, and we assessed the cost of production of a system incorporating a thin TaOx–Cu layer deposited on a silicon wafer, using pilot plant scale/semi-industrial coefficients for energy and gases used during the physical vapor deposition process,43,44 and most recent price indicators for each component of the electrocatalytic system.45–48 While other deposition methods reported here, such as RF sputtering, could further reduce the catalyst production cost, selecting physical vapor deposition (PVD) as a reference allows us to assess a less favorable scenario thus reducing the risk of overestimating the potential of the photocathode, being currently at an early development stage. Given the excellent reduction of the thickness of the catalyst, the manufacturing cost becomes practically reduced to the cost of the silicon wafer and the membrane (Fig. 9(b)), contributing together to >95% of the cost of the photoelectrode system (detailed cost contributions in ESI†). Intriguingly, similar results have been obtained for Au-based electrodes (SI), showing that thin catalyst layers allow us to drastically minimize the cost of metals used in catalyst development.
Looking at the return on investment into the proposed photoelectrochemical system, we deployed a recent protocol for the assessment of emerging electrolysis technologies (method details in the ESI†).49 Our assessment is based on a model of a Si–TaOx–Cu electrolyzer where 75% of supplied CO2 is being converted to a carbon-rich product, under experimentally reported 0.01 A cm−2 of current density and applying an external voltage of 1.2 V. We assumed an average market price for this ethylene-rich stream, current renewable electricity price42 between 0.02 and 0.05 $ per kW h, and a broad range of CO2 credit being paid for the avoided emissions of CO2 (our system allows emissions of petroleum-based CO2 by producing chemicals from biogenic CO2 to be avoided). The sensitivity analysis (Fig. 9(c)) demonstrates that in the presence of CO2 credit schemes, return on investment is even less than 2 years, which provides an incentive for further research and optimization of CO2 utilization methods. The decrease in the price of renewable electricity alone would not be sufficient to support these innovative approaches (see the grey area in Fig. 9(c), depicting non-viable scenarios), and the availability of CO2 credit will be critical for the growth of photoelectrochemical methods. Still, we need as well to address several scale-up challenges: demonstrate the capability to achieve increased CO2 conversion levels and avoid the formation of liquid products which will be more difficult to separate than the gaseous stream that we focus on. Importantly, electrolysis of seawater with a high concentration of salts might also lead to the formation of chlorine on the anode. However, the studies focusing on the production of hydrogen from seawater demonstrated that it is possible to effectively block chlorine formation by the addition of MnOx into the anode structure.50 Achieving the outstanding techno-economic metrics for the PEC system described here will thus necessitate coordinated efforts in further development of more scalable cathodes, anodes and related chemical process design.
Conclusions
In summary, TaOx was used as an ETL for Si photocathodes (Si/TaOx p–n junction) for the first time for CO2R. We first identified the major drawback of employing TiO2 as an ETL (reduction of TiO2 to Ti metal and evolution of H2) and then synthesized TaOx by 2 different synthesis techniques (PLD and RF sputtering). The electron selectivity of the TaOx ETLs was tuned by controlling the oxygen partial pressures during thin film deposition for both techniques. Si/TaOx/Cu photocathodes yielded much higher CO2R products (52% for PLD TaOx and 30% for RF sputtered TaOx) when compared with the Si/TiO2/Cu photocathode. We also demonstrated a dual ETL layer (Si/TiO2/TaOx/Cu) photocathode which could be a possible strategy for other photocathodes to suppress the HER and yield more CO2R products. The photovoltage of silicon photocathodes with the TaOx ETL/Cu catalyst was improved by using implanted contacts (n+ only on p-Si & n+ and p+ contacts on n-Si) from 300 mV to 430–460 mV. For the long-term stability of these photocathodes, the limiting factor was the Pt crossover from the counter electrode to the Si/TaOx/Cu photocathode. The photocathode was found to be stable (sustained ethylene production) for ∼300 min of CO2R photoelectrolysis when employing a graphite counter electrode to mitigate Pt crossover. By employing scalable synthesis techniques (RF sputtering for ETLs and Cu catalyst) and simple device architecture without any energy-intensive fabrication process (high-temperature growth/doping of Si), we have demonstrated the excellent scalability of the system. Our techno-economic analysis outlines pathways to making the photoelectrochemical platform a viable method for decarbonized chemical production, and we determined the scale of CO2 credit mechanisms necessary to support the growth of the photocatalytic field. This work also elucidates possible design strategies of other ETLs for CO2R photocathode-suppression of HER catalysis, good electronic conductivity and Pourbaix stability. Finally, this work raises the question whether there are favorable and/or tunable catalyst-metal oxide support interactions in this type of PEC approach and whether they can be tuned by the choice of metal oxide and by the deposition method. A potential method to investigate such effects would be to use ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS) to examine the influence of the ETL on the Cu oxidation state under operando PEC conditions.
