These molecules consist of three head-to-tail coupled oligo(3-hexylthiophene) arms covalently linked to a triphenylamine core which acts as the donor part. At the termini perylene monoimide moieties are attached as acceptors. These hybrid molecules, which differ by the length of the oligothiophene units, were effectively synthesized via palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-type couplings. Their optical and electrochemical properties were determined and structure–property relationships were established, clearly demonstrating the influence of the length of the integrated oligothiophene chains on the electronic nature of these hybrid systems.Introductionπ-Donor π-acceptor systems are considered to be promising candidates for applications in organic electronics, in particular in photovoltaic applications, converting sunlight into electrical energy.1 The field of organic photovoltaics has made tremendous progress over the last ten years accompanied by a rapid increase in energy conversion efficiencies.2 To contribute to this field of research, we recently reported the synthesis of linear perylenyl–oligothiophene dyad and triad molecules3 which combine the outstanding electronic properties and thermal stability of perylene (Per) dyes4 with those of structurally defined oligo(3-hexylthiophene)s.5 This novel type of donor acceptor system is characterized by a broad absorption within the terrestrial sun spectrum and corresponding bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic devices showed promising power conversion efficiencies3 and are superior to previously reported organic solar cells based on perylenes.6Triphenylamine and its derivatives have been widely investigated for the use in organic electronics, because they are characterized by good optical properties and p-type charge transport mobilities,7 allowing their use as hole-transport layers in organic field-effect transistors (OFET)8 or organic light emitting diodes (OLED).9 In this respect, p-type conductive star-shaped molecules have been recently synthesized combining triphenylamines (TPA) and oligothiophene (OT) chains attached to the central core.10Here, we report the synthesis of a series of star-shaped perylenyl–oligothiophene–triphenylamines (Per-OT-TPA) 5, 7, and 9. In contrast to our original linear perylenyl–oligothiophenes (Per-OT),3a this novel type of π-donor π-acceptor hybrid system was designed in a way that an extended donor part consisting of a TPA core and OT arms should preserve the typical p-type charge transport properties in the solid state, whereas the perylene units, [N-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)]-perylene-3,4-dicarboximide, attached to the termini of the OT chains should provide high absorptivity in the visible region as well as electron accepting properties. Furthermore, the intrinsic three-fold excess of acceptor over donor units present in these star-shaped molecules should facilitate photoinduced charge transfer and better meet the requirements found for conjugated polymer– or oligomer–fullerene bulk-heterojunction solar cells where the power conversion efficiency strongly depends on the ratio of donor and acceptor in the photoactive layer and the fullerene derivative typically is used in excess.11 The dependence of the optical and electrochemical properties of the star-shaped systems on the OT chain length, which varied from two to six thiophene units in each branch, was investigated. Based on these optical and electrochemical characterization structure–property relationships have been established.  Results and discussionSynthesisIn the series of perylene-functionalized head-to-tail coupled oligo(3-hexylthiophene)s, iodinated Per-OTs 4, 6, and 8 were employed as intermediate products for the elongation of the OT chain and were accessible via an effective mercury-mediated iodination procedure.3a In this approach, we utilized iodinated Per-OTs 4, 6, and 8 as starting materials for an optimized palladium-catalyzed Suzuki reaction, furnishing star-shaped Per-OT-TPAs 5, 7, and 9 in good yields. Prior to their synthesis, TPA boronic ester 3 as the core building block had to be prepared. The synthetic route started from commercially available TPA 1 which was reacted with bromine in chloroform at 0 °C to give tris(4-bromophenyl)amine 2 in 86% yield after recrystallization.12 Next, it was converted into the corresponding TPA boronic ester 3 by firstly treating tris(4-bromophenyl)amine 2 with n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) in THF at −80 °C. Subsequent addition of 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-[1,3,2]dioxaborolane afforded boronic ester 3 in 54% yield after recrystallization, making this synthetic route superior in comparison with the literature procedure which reported a yield of only 18%.13  In order to obtain Per-OT-TPAs 5, 7, and 9 a thoroughly optimized three-fold palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-type reaction was carried out. In this respect, iodinated Per-OTs 4, 6, and 83a were reacted with TPA boronic ester 3 in DME at 80 °C, using a 2 M aqueous sodium hydroxide solution as base and 15 mol% Pd(PPh3)4 as catalyst, furnishing star-shaped Per-OT-TPA 5 in 62% yield.  The higher homologues, quaterthiophene 7 and sexithiophene 9, were accessible under the same conditions in 54% and 45% yield, respectively. The obtained yields correspond to 77–85% efficiency per coupling step.These materials show high melting points ranging from 145–146 °C (9) to 192–193 °C (7) and to 247–248 °C (5). The highest melting point of the shortest representative Per-2T-TPA 5 is due to the predominant influence of the perylene units which as a pristine material is likely to form crystalline phases with high phase transition temperatures.14 With increasing length of the integrated oligothiophene chains in 7 and 9 the attached hexyl side chains aggravate the tendency of the perylene moieties to crystallize. In this respect, an increased number of alkyl side chains in these hybrid systems significantly decreases the corresponding melting points. In addition, it is well known that triphenylamine and its derivatives form amorphous phases.15 However, detailed DSC investigations on the hybrid systems 5, 7 and 9 showed no glass transitions and accordingly they do not possess amorphous character.In order to thoroughly elucidate the physical properties of Per-OT-TPAs 5, 7, and 9 reference system 2T-TPA 13 has been synthesized in which the terminal reactive α-positions of the bithiophene units were blocked by a methyl group in order to prevent oxidative coupling processes. The synthesis was derived from brominated bithiophene 103a which firstly was treated with n-BuLi in THF at −80 °C and secondly was reacted with trifluoromethansulfonate to give methylated bithiophene 11 in 70% yield after distillation in vacuo. Next, 11 was selectively brominated at the free α-position with NBS in DMF at 0 °C. After filtration over silica, bithiophene 12 was accessible in 97% yield.  In the third step, Suzuki coupling of TPA boronic ester 3 and bromobithiophene 12 was carried out at room temperature in the presence of the catalytic system Pd2(dba)3/H[P(t-Bu)3]BF4,16 yielding 74% of 2T-TPA 13 after column chromatography.Optical propertiesFor the series of Per-OT-TPAs 5, 7, and 9 and reference compound 13 optical and redox properties were determined and an energy level diagram of the frontier orbitals was deduced from the data set. The absorption and emission maxima, fluorescence quantum yields and the optical energy gaps for the series are given in Table 1 and compared to the parent linear Per-OTs.3a The energy gaps were determined from the onset of the longest wavelength absorption band of the hybrid molecules. This set of data allows for the establishment of clear structure–property relationships which typically depend on the inverse chain length of the corresponding conjugated π-systems.17

The bands at lowest and highest energy originate from the excitation of the perylene moieties. Their maxima (λabs3 = 520–519 nm, λabs1 = 266 nm) are practically identical for all three compounds and independent of the chain length of the OT branches resulting in a constant optical band gap of ΔEopt = 2.11 eV. This behaviour is directly comparable to that of the parent linear Per-OTs (Table 1) and indicates that donor and acceptor units are electronically decoupled which is due to steric interactions. As expected, these bands are completely missing in reference 2T-TPA 13. Whereas the perylene absorption band at high energies does not alter in shape, with increasing chain length of the OT branches the vibronic distribution of the low energy π–π* transition is changed. This effect arises from the superposition of the third band in the absorption spectra in the region between 350 and 500 nm which come from the π–π* transition of the donor part. With increasing OT chain length their maxima are bathochromically shifted (λabs2 = 404–438 nm) as well in comparison to the parent linear Per-OTs (Δλabs2 = 104–30 nm). These strong shifts which become gradually less pronounced on going from 5 to 7 to 9 clearly indicate that the TPA core and the OT branches are in full π-conjugation and have to be considered as the donor system. This assumption is further supported, firstly, by the absence of absorption around 300 nm that can be ascribed to pristine TPA (λabs = 304 nm) and, secondly, by the comparison of the intensities of the donor absorptions with those of the parent linear Per-OTs and reference compound 2T-TPA 13. The latter exhibits similar optical properties to those of the donor system of 5. We note that the extinction coefficients for the star-shaped systems are more than three times higher than expected and arise from the extension of the Per-OT π-system by the TPA unit. This effect is most pronounced for the smallest homologue, Per-OT-TPA 5, exhibiting a value of ε = 79000 L mol−1 cm−1 which is by a factor of 4.9 higher than for parent linear Per-OTs (ε = 16100 L mol−1 cm−1). Fig. 1  UV-Vis spectra of perylenyl–oligothiophene–triphenylamines 5, 7, and 9 and reference compound 13 in chloroform (c = 5 × 10−5 mol l−1). For the solid-state absorption spectra of Per-OT-TPAs 5, 7, and 9 thin films were spin-coated onto glass substrates from the corresponding toluene solutions (c = 20 mg ml−1). The absorption spectra in the solid state (Fig. 2) show the same trends as the solution spectra. In general, broadening and red-shifts of the bands are visible, resulting in smaller band gaps by 0.10 eV. No displacement is observed for the perylene absorption maxima, whereas a shift of the π–π* transition of the donor part is observed for Per-4T-TPA 7 (Δλmax = 17 nm) and Per-6T-TPA 9 (Δλmax = 27 nm). This behaviour is very typical for oligo-3 and polythiophenes18 and very favourable for applications in solar cells, because in particular the larger members 7 and 9 in the series cover a broad range of the visible spectrum between 250 and 650 nm with high optical densities. In contrast, Per-2T-TPA 5 shows only a small displacement of the donor absorption maximum in the solid-state (Δλmax = 4 nm), which is in accordance with reference 2T-TPA 13 exhibiting an identical solid-state absorption maximum (λmax = 404 nm). Fig. 2  Solid-state UV-Vis spectra of thin films of the perylenyl–oligothiophene–triphenylamines 5, 7, and 9 and reference compound 13 spin-coated on glass (normalized to the maximum of the perylene absorption band). Corrected emission spectra for the whole series of compounds were measured in chloroform (Table 1). Per-OT-TPAs 5, 7, and 9 exhibit very weak, non-structured and broad emission bands. With increasing length of the oligothiophene units the fluorescence maxima are gradually blue-shifted, as bithiophene 5 reveals an emission maximum at λmax = 630 nm, quaterthiophene 7 at λmax = 595 nm and sexithiophene 9 at λmax = 573 nm. This rather unexpected behaviour has already been found for the parent linear Per-OTs and will be discussed in detail in a forthcoming paper.19 Irrespective of the OT chain length the fluorescence quantum yields are extremely low with values around 1%. The quenching of the acceptor luminescence is an indication for photoinduced charge transfer processes occurring within these hybrid systems and has been confirmed by time-resolved emission and transient absorption spectroscopy.20 This finding is in full accordance with the parent linear Per-OTs which also have been extensively investigated by time-resolved optical measurements.21 Furthermore, reference compound 2T-TPA 13 without acceptor moieties shows an intense emission at 460 nm and a relatively high fluorescence quantum yield of 65%.22Electrochemical propertiesOxidation and reduction potentials of Per-OT-TPAs 5, 7, 9 and reference compound TPA-2T 13 were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in dichloromethane using tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting salt and are referenced to the internal standard ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) (Fig. 3). The redox potentials and the electrochemically determined band gaps ΔECV, measured as the potential difference between the onset of the first oxidation and the first reduction wave, respectively, are given in Table 2. In order to deduce structure–property relationships the individual redox waves of 5, 7, and 9 are compared to those of the parent linear Per-OTs3a and reference 13.

Due to the electron withdrawing nature of the carbonyl oxygens, the anions are mainly located at the imide groups.23 The high currents observed during the reductions give rise to a transfer of three electrons, simultaneously generating a stable radical anion and dianion on each perylene moiety, respectively. A direct comparison to the parent linear Per-OTs reveals that the reduction waves are located at exactly the same potentials revealing that the electronic properties of the perylene subunits in 5, 7 and 9 are in excellent agreement with those of the linear Per-OTs. Since these values are very close to those of pure perylenes,3 in accordance with the optical measurements, a full electronic decoupling from the donor system and no influence of the OT-TPA core on the electronic properties of the perylene subunits can be noted. As expected from the large optical band gap ΔEopt., reference compound 2T-TPA 13 shows no reduction waves in the negative potential regime.In the positive potential regime, all Per-OT-TPAs 5, 7 and 9 show complex CVs and multiple redox waves, because there is interference and complicated mutual influence of the perylene with the OT-TPA oxidation processes. The detailed analysis of the various redox transitions and the assignment of the individual redox waves becomes possible by comparison to the CVs of parent linear Per-OTs and to those of reference 2T-TPA 13.Per-2T-TPA 5 shows five reversible oxidation waves at E°ox1 = 0.29 V, E°ox2 = 0.56 V, E°ox3 = 0.77 V, E°ox4 = 0.96 V and E°ox5 = 1.20 V. The first four oxidation processes are single-electron transfers and can be assigned to the oxidation of the OT-TPA donor moiety, whereas the fifth originates from the oxidation of the terminal perylene acceptors. The first oxidation wave is significantly negatively shifted with respect to pristine TPA (ΔE°ox = 0.24 V) and to the linear Per-2T (ΔE°ox = 0.42 V). This result indicates, in accordance with the optical properties, that the donor system of 5 is characterized by a strong π-conjugation between the TPA core and the adjacent bithiophene units. Moreover, the absence of an additional oxidation wave at around 0.5 V due to the oxidation of the pure TPA unit also alludes to a completely π-conjugated OT-TPA donor system. If the donor system would be decoupled and divided into a TPA core and three discrete OT subunits, then oxidation waves similar to those of the linear Per-OTs but corresponding to the transfer of three electrons plus one for the oxidation of pure TPA as a one-electron process would be observed.A mimic of the electrochemical behaviour of the donor system can be found in reference 2T-TPA 13, showing four reversible oxidation waves at E°ox1 = 0.23 V, E°ox2 = 0.49 V, E°ox3 = 0.66 V, and E°ox4 = 0.79 V, as well as a fifth irreversible wave at E°ox5 = 1.17 V. The oxidation processes in 2T-TPA 13 are slightly facilitated in comparison to Per-2T-TPA 5 (ΔE°ox1 = 0.06 V, ΔE°ox2 = 0.07 V, ΔE°ox3 = 0.11 V, ΔE°ox4 = 0.17 V) due to the replacement of the terminal electron-withdrawing perylene units by the weakly donating methyl groups, which stabilize the various cationic species generated during the oxidation steps.In the case of the higher homologues, Per-OT-TPAs 7 and 9, similar electrochemical properties of the donor systems can be found. The CVs also show four oxidation waves demonstrating full π-conjugation within the OT-TPA donor systems which, as a result of the more extended π-systems, gradually decline in potential the longer the OT chain length becomes.A comparison of the first oxidation potentials (E°ox1) of the OT units in parent linear Per-OTs with those of the donor units in corresponding Per-OT-TPAs 5, 7, and 9, reveals that in the latter cases E°ox1 is considerably shifted to lower potentials. This potential shift is most pronounced in the case of bithiophene 5 (ΔE°ox1 = 0.42 V) and gradually decreases with increasing oligothiophene chain length (7: ΔE°ox1 = 0.19 V; 9: ΔE°ox1 = 0.09 V) indicating a diminished electronic influence of the TPA core with increasing size of the conjugated donor systems.Oxidation of the perylene moieties in Per-OT-TPAs 5, 7, and 9 is found at more positive potentials than the OT waves (E°ox = 1.20 V (5), 1.11 V (7), 0.97 V (9)) in which the process is facilitated with increasing OT chain length. The values are comparable to those of the parent linear3a and dimeric Per-OTs.3b This mutual influence originates from an electronic interaction occurring during the subsequent oxidation processes in which the OT-TPA donor system is oxidized prior to the perylene unit and accordingly an electron-withdrawing tetracation is formed. Compared to the oxidation of pristine perlyene monoimide PDCI (E°ox = 0.95 V)3a this effect is most pronounced for Per-OT-TPAs 5 (ΔE°ox = 0.21 V) because the tetracation is delocalized on the smallest donor system and therefore has the highest charge density. For the higher homologues 7 and 9 corresponding tetracations are delocalized over larger π-systems reducing their electron withdrawing capacity and therefore show smaller potential differences (ΔE°ox = 0.12 V (7), 0.02 V (9)).The electrochemical band gaps ΔECV were determined from the CVs by taking the difference between the onset of the first oxidation and reduction process, respectively (Table 2). In this series the band gap is almost constant and shows only a weak decrease from Per-2T-TPA 5 (ΔECV = 1.55 eV) to Per-6T-TPA 9 (ΔECV = 1.47 eV) reflecting the decreasing oxidation potential of the OT subunit. The electrochemically determined band gaps deviate from the optically determined gaps, because they take donor oxidation and perylene reduction into account, whereas the latter ones represent the electronic properties of the decoupled perylene unit.MO energiesMO energy diagrams are very helpful for the construction and understanding of organic devices in which the fundamental processes are decisively determined by charged states and their corresponding energy level in the active organic layer.24 In order to calculate the absolute energies of the HOMO and LUMO levels of Per-OT-TPAs 5, 7, 9 and reference compound 2T-TPA 13 with respect to the vacuum level, the redox data are standardized to the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple which has a calculated absolute energy of −4.8 eV.25In the energy diagram (Fig. 4), Per-OT-TPAs 5, 7, 9 and reference 13 are related to the electrode work functions commonly used for the fabrication of standard photovoltaic devices. The HOMO–LUMO band gaps of the hybrid systems 5, 7 and 9 only slightly decrease with increasing chain length of the OT unit which is due to a gradual decrease of the HOMO energy level while those of the LUMO stay constant. The HOMO levels of the hybrid molecules are lower in energy with respect to the work function of a PEDOT-covered ITO electrode, therefore allowing holes to be easily injected from the cathode into the photoactive layer. In order to fulfil the requirement for the fabrication of single-layer or fullerene bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic devices, hybrid molecules 5, 7, and 9 exhibit LUMO levels which are sufficiently high in energy to inject electrons to both, the LUMO of PCBM and of the aluminium anode. It is also evident from the energy diagram that the LUMO of reference TPA-2T 13 lies significantly higher in energy compared to those of Per-OT-TPAs 5, 7, and 9 due to the absence of the perylene acceptors.

In a standardized setup, a first bulk-heterojunction device was manufactured, consisting of a PEDOT ∶ PSS-covered ITO cathode, a 1 ∶ 4 mixture of Per-4T-TPA 7 and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the photoactive layer and a top anode of aluminium. This device exhibited a photoresponse with an open-circuit voltage of VOC = 0.60 V, a short-circuit current of ISC = 1.4 mA cm−2 and a fill factor of FF = 0.29, resulting in a power conversion efficiency of 0.25% under calculated standard test conditions (AM 1.5 G, 1000 W m−2) (Fig. 5). These solar cells are not yet fully optimized and their stability under sunlight has not yet been determined.

ConclusionsWe synthesized a series of star-shaped hybrid systems with a novel molecular architecture consisting of three terminal perylene monoimides covalently attached to an extended donor system which itself is delocalized over a triphenylamine core and three adjacent head-to-tail coupled oligo(3-hexylthiophene)s. While the type of perylene acceptor remained unchanged the oligothiophene donor system was systematically varied in length from a bithiophene to a sexithiophene. These novel donor–acceptor systems were obtained by an optimized palladium-catalyzed Suzuki-type reaction. Detailed investigations of the electronic properties of the series in solution and in the solid state clearly revealed that there is a systematic change in the spectral range of absorption, redox potentials and energy gaps. Clear structure–property relationships of the novel type of donor–acceptor molecules provide a valuable data set for their application in organic solar cells. The fabrication and characterization of a first corresponding photovoltaic device based on a blend of Per-4T-TPA 7 with PCBM revealed a non-optimized power conversion efficiency of 0.25% under a simulated terrestrial sun spectrum.ExperimentalGeneral1H NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on a Bruker AMX 400 at 400 MHz. 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on a Bruker AMX 400 at 100 MHz. Chemical shifts are denoted in δ units (ppm), and were referenced to internal tetramethylsilane (0.0 ppm). The splitting patterns are designated as follows: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), and m (multiplet) and the assignments are Pery (perylene), Ph (phenyl), Th (thiophene), TPA (triphenylamine) for 1H NMR. Mass spectra were recorded with a Varian Saturn 2000 GC-MS and with a MALDI-TOF MS Bruker Reflex 2 (dithranol as matrix). Elemental analyses were performed on a Perkin-Elmer EA 2400. Melting points were determined with a Büchi B-545 melting point apparatus and are not corrected. Gas chromatography was carried out using a Varian CP-3800 gas chromatograph. HPCL analyses were performed on a Shimadsu SCL-10A equipped with a SPD-M10A photodiode array detector and a SC-10A solvent delivery system using a LiChrosphor column (Silica 60, 5 µm, Merck). Thin-layer chromatography was carried out on Silica Gel 60 F254 aluminium plates (Merck). Developed plates were dried and examined under a UV lamp. Preparative column chromatography was carried out on glass columns of different sizes packed with silica gel Merck 60 (40–63 µm). UV-Vis spectra were taken on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 19 in 1 cm cuvettes. Thin uniform films for solid-state spectra were obtained on a POLOS wafer spinner from a toluene solution (20 mg ml−1) at 5000 rpm onto a glass substrate. Fluorescence spectra were measured with a Perkin-Elmer LS 55 in 1 cm cuvettes. Fluorescence quantum yields were determined with respect to N-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)perylene-3,4-dicarboxmide (PDCI) (Φ = 0.9 in chloroform26). Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed with a computer-controlled EG&G PAR 273 potentiostat in a three-electrode single-compartment cell (5 ml). The platinum working electrode consisted of a platinum wire sealed in a soft glass tube with a surface of A = 0.785 mm2, which was polished down to 0.5 µm with Buehler polishing paste prior to use in order to obtain reproducible surfaces. The counter electrode consisted of a platinum wire and the reference electrode was an Ag/AgCl secondary electrode. All potential were internally referenced to the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple.25 For the measurements concentrations of 10−3 mol l−1 of the electroactive species were used in freshly distilled and deaerated dichloromethane (Lichrosolv, Merck) and 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAHFP, Fluka) which was twice recrystallized from ethanol and dried under vacuum prior to use. Solvents and reagents were purified and dried by usual methods prior to use and typically used under inert gas atmosphere. The following starting materials were purchased and used without further purification: n-butyllithium (1.59 M in n-hexane, Merck), pinacol (Aldrich), tri(isopropyl)borate (Merck). Tetrakis(triphenylphosphino)palladium(0)27 and 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-[1,3,2]dioxaborolane28 were prepared according to literature procedures.Tris(4-bromophenyl)amine (2)Triphenylamine 1 (10.6 g, 43 mmol) was dissolved in 43 ml of chloroform and cooled down to 0 °C prior to the dropwise addition of bromine (20.7 g, 0.130) under light protection. After complete addition of the bromine the resulting green solution was stirred for another hour and the crude product was precipitated by addition of 100 ml of an ethanol–water mixture [1 ∶ 1]. The white solid was filtered off and dissolved in 20 ml of hot chloroform. After addition of 50 ml hot ethanol the product was allowed to crystallize overnight at −18 °C, before the precipitate was filtered off and dried in vacuum. Tris(4-bromophenyl)amine 2 (18.0 g, 86% [lit: 90%]12) was obtained as white crystals: mp 143–144 °C (lit: 144–146 °C);121H NMR (CDCl3): δ = 7.35 (approx. d, J = 8.7 Hz, 6H, 3H,5H), 6.92 (approx. d, J = 8.8 Hz, 6H, 2H,6H); 13C NMR (CDCl3): δ = 146.06, 132.52, 125.62, 116.07.Tris{4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-[1,3,2]dioxaborolane)phenyl}amine (3)To a solution of tris(4-bromophenyl)amine 2 (0.96 g, 2 mmol) in 40 ml dry THF at −80 °C was added n-butyllithium (3.77 ml, 6 mmol). After stirring at −80 °C for one hour 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-[1,3,2]dioxaborolane (1.24 g, 6.6 mmol) was added to the resulting suspension. The solution was allowed to warm up to room temperature prior to the removal of the solvent. The residue was suspended in chloroform and was poured into water. The water phase was extracted with chloroform. Next, the combined organic phases were dried with magnesium sulfate and the solution was concentrated in vacuo (1 ml). After the addition of hot ethanol (10 ml) the product was allowed to crystallize over night at −18 °C. The resulting colorless crystals were filtered off and dried in vacuum, yielding 700 mg (54% [lit: 20%]13) of the boronic ester 3.
