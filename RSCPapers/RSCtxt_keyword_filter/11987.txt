    , Accepted 11th April 2016First published on 11th April 2016AbstractSmall-molecule hole transporting materials based on methoxydiphenylamine-substituted fluorene fragments were synthesized and incorporated into a perovskite solar cell, which displayed a power conversion efficiency of up to 19.96%, one of the highest conversion efficiencies reported. The investigated hole transporting materials were synthesized in two steps from commercially available and relatively inexpensive starting reagents, resulting in up to fivefold cost reduction of the final product compared with spiro-OMeTAD. Electro-optical and thermoanalytical measurements such as UV/Vis, thin-film conductivity, hole mobility, DSC, TGA, ionization potential and current voltage scans of the full perovskite solar cells have been carried out to characterize the new materials.

Broader context
Over the past few years, organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites have emerged as a new force in the field of photovoltaics. The rapid progress of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has led to certified solar energy conversion efficiencies of above 20%, which brings this technology to the cohort of highly performing solar cells, while keeping the promise of low cost energy production. So far, improvement of the efficiencies of PSCs mainly relied on employing various device fabricating methods, engineering of perovskite morphology and composition. However, commercialization of the high efficiency PSCs is hindered not only by imperfect device fabrication methods, but also by the use of prohibitively expensive materials. Spiro-OMeTAD is one of the most commonly used hole transporting materials employed in the construction of PSCs. Unfortunately, expensive synthesis and purification procedures result in efficient but costly materials; therefore, a low-cost alternative that would perform just as well is highly desirable.

Hybrid organic–inorganic hybrid materials, particularly the perovskite family, have shown great promise for use in field-effect transistors, light-emitting diodes, lasers, tandems with silicon, plasmonics, sensors and photodetectors.1–5 Recently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of lead halide perovskite (APbX3, A = methylammonium, formamidinium; X = Br, I)-based thin film photovoltaic devices6,7 has skyrocketed from 3.8% to more than 21.1% in just a few years.8–15 In a typical perovskite solar cell (PSC), a several-hundred-nanometer-thick absorber layer, either with or without a mesoporous scaffold, is sandwiched between the electron and hole transport layers (ETLs and HTLs, respectively). Upon the absorption of incident photons, carriers are created in the absorber that travel through a transport pathway including the ETL or HTL, the electrodes, and each interface in between. In order to increase the power conversion efficiency, it is essential to precisely manipulate carriers along the entire pathway from the absorber to both electrodes. To date, progress has been made on each layer, with major emphasis on the perovskite film processing and relevant material design. For example, Jeon and co-workers7 achieved one of the highest certified PCEs of 17.9% by optimising the anti-solvent method with a mixed cation, a mixed halide perovskite precursor that is similar to the approach used here and in our previous reports.16,17
Despite significant efforts dedicated towards the development of new hole transporting materials (HTMs), this field is still dominated by costly 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9-9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) and even more expensive poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA).14,18,19
The high cost of these HTM arises from the prohibitively expensive synthesis and purification procedures used. For example, spiro-OMeTAD is synthesized in five reaction steps that require low temperature (−78 °C), and sensitive (n-butyllithium or Grignard reagents) and aggressive (Br2) reagents.20 In addition, high-purity sublimation-grade spiro-OMeTAD is required to obtain high-performance devices.
Over the past few years, tremendous efforts have been made to develop alternative molecules with similar performance. However, most of these molecules fail to demonstrate performance similar to those of spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA.18,19,21–28
Here we report a new type of branched hole transporting molecule (Fig. 1), based on methoxydiphenylamine-substituted fluorene, with PSC performance equal to that of spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA. Perovskite solar cells employing the investigated HTMs demonstrate a power conversion efficiency of up to 19.96%, which is one of the highest values reported. Furthermore, these compounds do not require an extensive and costly synthesis procedure and could be obtained using a simple two-step method from readily available commercial starting materials. High solubility in organic solvents, an important characteristic for applications utilizing solution processing techniques, and ease of preparation make these HTM very appealing for commercial prospects of perovskite solar cells.

The synthesis of a new type of branched hole transporting molecule is straightforward and involves the condensation of 2,7-dibromofluorene with the corresponding aromatic dialdehyde, followed by a palladium-catalysed C–N cross-coupling reaction with 4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine (Scheme 1). Intermediate compounds 1–3 are isolated as crystalline materials and could be used in the next step without further purification. More detailed information on the synthesis can be found in the ESI.†

Material cost estimations for the synthesis of V859 and V862 have been performed following the procedure established by Osedach et al. (cost estimations can be found in the ESI†).29 It was estimated that the material cost for V862 was ∼23 $ g−1. Using a less expensive phthaldialdehyde linking unit in V859 reduces the cost even further to ∼15 $ g−1 which is less than one-fifth the cost of the reference HTM, spiro-OMeTAD (Table 1).30 Furthermore, these materials, unlike spiro-OMeTAD, do not require purification via expensive sublimation procedures.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements reveal that the films of the investigated HTM are amorphous and show good thermal stability; the materials start to decompose at temperatures above 420 °C (Fig. 2a, Table 2). A slight weight loss (∼1.3%) at around 100–200 °C in the case of compound V862 is attributed to the evaporation of the traces of solvents that remained after purification of the material. DSC scans demonstrate that all three compounds are fully amorphous and show glass transition temperatures (Tg) in the range between 137 and 155 °C (Fig. 2b, Table 2). Tg values of V852, V859, and V862 are higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD (126 °C), indicating a more stable amorphous state and reduced tendency to crystallize, which is beneficial for the overall device stability.31

The UV-vis absorption bands of the fluorene based hole transporting materials V852, V859, and V862 were measured in THF and are shown in Fig. 3a. All three investigated materials are based on the similar principal structure, i.e. two or three fluorene cores with attached 4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine fragments linked together by a central unit; therefore, their UV-vis spectra are quite similar as well.
 Fig. 3  UV-vis absorption spectra of V852, V859, V862, and spiro-OMeTAD (a) and oxidized spiro(TFSI)2 and V859(TFSI)2 (b) in THF (c = 10−4 M). 
The π–π* absorption bands for V852 and V859 are observed at around 375 nm and are hypsochromically shifted with respect to the reference spiro-OMeTAD by ∼8–17 nm, indicating a small decrease in the size of the π-conjugated system. Most likely, due to the central linking unit, the methoxydiphenylamine-substituted fluorene fragments are a bit more twisted out-of-plane compared with spiro-OMeTAD. An increased number of fluorene moieties in V852 also results in a hyperchromical shift of the absorption spectrum.
The substitution of the phenyl central unit with thiophene in V862 results in different arrangements of the methoxydiphenylamine-substituted fluorene moieties and an additional absorption band at 455 nm is observed. Most likely, it is caused by the increase in size of the π-conjugated system via the thiophene linking fragment.32

Similarly to spiro(TFSI)2, chemically oxidized V859(TFSI)2 exhibits absorption bands at around 520 nm, 650 nm and 1400 nm, indicating formation of the oxidized species.
The solid-state ionization potential (Ip) is important for organic materials that are used for optoelectronic applications. Ip of the undoped HTMs was measured using photoelectron spectroscopy via the air (PESA) method (Fig. S2, ESI† and Table 3).

The measurement results indicate that Ip values of the three investigated materials are similar as all of them share the same methoxydiphenylamine-substituted fluorene main fragment.
The oxidation (Eox) potentials of the fluorene-based HTMs V852, V859, and V862 were measured by employing a cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique (Table 3). These values do not represent any absolute solid-state or gas-phase ionization energies, but can be used to compare different compounds relative to one another. The cyclic voltammograms of all synthesized compounds show quasi-reversible oxidation signals (Fig. S1, ESI†) and differences in the CV results are quite small, mostly because the investigated molecules structurally are quite similar, although, there are some slight variations in the energy levels. PESA and cyclic voltammetry measurements of the synthesized HTMs reveal that their solid-state Ip and oxidation potentials in solution are quite similar to those of the spiro-OMeTAD. Charge transport properties of the synthesized HTM were studied using the xerographic time-of-flight (XTOF) technique (Fig. 4). Values of charge mobility defining parameters, zero field mobility (μ0), Poole–Frenkel parameter (α), and the mobility at the electric field of 6.4 × 105 V cm−1, are given in Table 3. The synthesized hole transporting materials demonstrate a respectable charge mobility; XTOF measurements indicate that the hole-drift mobility in V859 and V862 is ∼10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 at weak electric fields and ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 at a field strength of 6.4 × 105 V cm−1. The charge mobility in the films of V859 and V862 is similar to or better than that of spiro-OMeTAD measured in this work and reported elsewhere.34V852 demonstrates one order of magnitude lower results, and most likely an increased bulk of the molecule prevents tight packing and makes it more difficult for the charge to hop between sites.

The lateral thin-film conductivity of V852, V859, V862 and spiro-OMeTAD layers was measured on a spin-coated thin film (chlorobenzene) on OFET substrates (Table 3, Fig. S5, ESI†). In the absence of FK209, no ohmic contact could be observed and the measured currents were very small compared to the currents measured upon addition of FK209. In the case of doped HTMs, ohmic contacts are formed with gold and the conductivity upon addition of 5 mol% of FK209 is extracted by making a linear fit and using the Ohm's law. The conductivity of doped V859 and V862 was determined to be ∼4.5 × 10−5 S cm−1 and although it is about one order of magnitude lower than that measured in the doped spiro-OMeTAD (4.7 × 10−4 S cm−1),35 it is sufficient for good performance in perovskite solar cells. In a similar manner to hole mobility, increased size of V852 results in lower conductivity as well.
The new semiconductors V852, V859, and V862 were tested as HTMs in perovskite solar cells (where the perovskite precursor contained a cation and anion mixture) using a device stack of fluorine doped tin oxide(FTO)/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/perovskite/HTM/Au. All fabrication details can be found in the ESI.†
The maximum power conversion efficiency of 19.96% under AM 1.5 G illumination was recorded in the perovskite device containing V862 as the hole transporting material (Table S1, ESI†). The measured fill factor was 0.77, the current density (Jsc) was 22.5 mA cm−2, and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) was 1139 mV (Fig. 5). V859 demonstrated similar good results: maximum power conversion efficiency of 19.47% under AM 1.5 G illumination, fill factor of 0.75, the current density (Jsc) of 23.3 mA cm−2, and the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1120 mV.
 Fig. 5  Best performing current density–voltage characteristics of V852, V859, V862 and spiro-OMeTAD as the hole transporting material. The voltage scan rate was 10 mV s−1 and no device preconditioning, such as light soaking or forward voltage bias applied for a long time, was applied before starting the measurement. The full hysteresis loop (forward and backward scans) for each scan is listed in Table S1 (ESI†). 
The structural bulk of V852 had a visible negative impact on a number of important characteristics, such as charge mobility, conductivity and size of the π-conjugated system. Predictably, it also had an adverse effect on the performance of the semiconductor in the perovskite-based solar cells. Spiro-OMeTAD was used as a reference material and the best device from the same batch of solar cells, prepared following the same device fabrication procedure, but using spiro as the hole-extracting layer displayed a PCE of 18.25%.
Perovskite solar cells are well known to exhibit hysteretic behaviour, i.e. a discrepancy between the forward and backward scan, which can result in largely distorted performance parameters.36,37 For example, seemingly high PCEs can be achieved upon a fast scanning of the device from open-circuit to short-circuit conditions (reverse scan) but these values drop significantly at slower scan rates.37 Therefore, all JV measurements were taken at a slow scan rate of 10 mV s−1, resembling quasi-steady-state conditions as suggested independently by Unger et al. and Kamat and co-workers.37,38 The full hysteresis loop with the corresponding performance parameter for each device is reported in Table S1 (ESI†).
First stability assessment for unencapsulated V859 and V862 devices stored under dry conditions in the dark for 50 days (Table S5, ESI†) has also been conducted. Similar performance devices have been chosen for the test and it demonstrated that during this time there is some degree of degradation in the PSC devices constructed using V862 but almost none in the perovskite solar cells with V859. This indicates that after identifying and synthesizing inexpensive alternatives to spiro, stabilisation strategies need to be investigated for future work.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a new group of small-molecule hole conductors that yield a very high overall efficiency (up to 20%) in perovskite-based solar cells. These molecules are as efficient as currently best-performing HTMs, spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA; however, their synthesis and purification are significantly less costly, complicated and time-consuming. They can be produced in two steps from commercially available materials for less than a quarter of the cost of spiro-OMeTAD and are thus very promising for large-scale production of perovskite solar cells.

Broader context
Over the past few years, organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites have emerged as a new force in the field of photovoltaics. The rapid progress of the perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has led to certified solar energy conversion efficiencies of above 20%, which brings this technology to the cohort of highly performing solar cells, while keeping the promise of low cost energy production. So far, improvement of the efficiencies of PSCs mainly relied on employing various device fabricating methods, engineering of perovskite morphology and composition. However, commercialization of the high efficiency PSCs is hindered not only by imperfect device fabrication methods, but also by the use of prohibitively expensive materials. Spiro-OMeTAD is one of the most commonly used hole transporting materials employed in the construction of PSCs. Unfortunately, expensive synthesis and purification procedures result in efficient but costly materials; therefore, a low-cost alternative that would perform just as well is highly desirable.
