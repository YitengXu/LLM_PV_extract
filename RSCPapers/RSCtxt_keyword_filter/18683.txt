    , Accepted 26th February 2016First published on 15th March 2016AbstractLow band-gap A–Ar–A and Ar(A–D)2 type small molecules (SMs) of DPP2Py, ThDPP2Py and TPADPP2Py were designed and synthesized, in which pyrene (Py) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) were respectively used as central aryl (Ar) and arm acceptor (A) units and 2-octylthiophene (Th) and triphenylamine (TPA) were employed as terminal donor (D) units. The effects of the central aryl and terminal units on optical, electrochemical, morphological and photovoltaic properties were primarily investigated. Compared to the reported analogues of DPP2Ar, in which Ar respectively represents 1,4-phenylene, 2,6-naphthalene and 2,6-anthracene, both DPP2Py and ThDPP2Py showed significantly improved photovoltaic performance in solution-processed organic solar cells. Furthermore, ThDPP2Py exhibited better photovoltaic performance than DPP2Py in these cells under optimized processing conditions. An improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.88% with a short current density (Jsc) of 15.35 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 57.89% was obtained for the ThDPP2Py based OPV cells. Our research result demonstrates that properly extending the central aryl ring and appending terminal units in A–Ar–A type SMs can significantly improve the photovoltaic performance of Ar(A–D)2 type SMs.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells with a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure have attracted considerable attention for their promising applications in next-generation clean and renewable energy sources because of their advantages such as light weight, flexibility, and low cost.1–4 With the rapid progress over recent years, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.8% for single-junction devices has been achieved for polymer-based OPV (P-OPV) cells.5 Due to the disadvantages of polydispersity and reproducibility of polymers,6–9 small molecules (SMs) have been widely investigated as an attractive alternative because of their well-defined structures, good dispersity, easy purification and superior batch-to-batch reproducibility.10–14 A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.1% has been achieved for SM-based OPV (SM-OPV) cells.15 However, only a few SMs showed PCE values of 8–10%, which are limited for commercial applications. Furthermore, the structure–property relationship has still not been made clear for photovoltaic SMs and their OPV devices. It is a challenging task to further improve the photovoltaic performance of SMs.
For the design of photovoltaic SMs, one of the most successful approaches is combining alternative electron-rich donor (D) and electron-deficient acceptor (A) moieties in their structures, which can result in a low band gap, intense light absorption, strong intra- and inter-molecular interactions, and efficient charge transport.16–20 As a result, a large amount of SMs with an A–D–A framework were synthesized and systematically investigated.21–41 For instance, the Zhan et al. group reported a two-dimensional SM of BDT-2DPP containing a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) core and two diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) arms, which demonstrated a PCE of 5.79% in a SM-OPV cell.29 Jo et al. reported a SM based on dithienopyran and DPP units, and showed a PCE up to 6.88%.41 Peng et al. reported a series of SMs based on DPP and porphyrin moieties, and presented a PCE of 8.02%.35 It is interesting that A–D–A type SMs using DPP as the acceptor unit exhibited good photovoltaic performance in OPV devices.
In order to further enhance absorption and improve the photovoltaic performance of SMs, another type of SM with a D(A–D′)2 framework was recently developed.42–52 The significant effect of the length, linkage position, aromaticity and dipole moment of terminal groups on optical, electrical, morphological and photovoltaic performances was observed. The tetrafluorine-substituted SMs with a linear D(A–D′)2 framework containing indacenodithiophene and difluorobenzothiadiazole units demonstrated a high PCE of 8.1%.45
In our previous work, we reported an A–Ar–A type SM of DPP2An(2,6) containing anthracene (An) and DPP units,53 which exhibited an increased PCE of 5.44% compared to the reported DPP dimer and DPP2Ar analogues with a less fused ring, such as 1,4-phenylene and 2,6-naphthalene.39,40 In order to systematically explore the effect of the central aryl (Ar) fused ring and molecular framework on the photovoltaic performance of SMs with A–Ar–A and Ar(A–D)2 frameworks, in this work, we used 2,7-pyrene (Py) as a central Ar core, DPP as the armed A unit and 2-octylthiophene (Th) or triphenyl-amine (TPA) as the terminal D group to construct the A–Ar–A type SM of DPP2Py and the Ar(A–D)2 type SMs of ThDPP2Py and TPADPP2Py. Their molecular structures are shown in Fig. 1. As pyrene has a larger aromatic hydrocarbon ring and better planarity than anthracene, it can further enhance the absorption and increase the molecular packing of its SMs, which are available for the increase of the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) in OPV devices. Furthermore, while the Th and TPA are attached to the molecular terminal, they can extend the molecular π-conjugation system and broaden the absorption spectra, which are favorable for the further increase of Jsc. Therefore, the designed A–Ar–A and Ar(A–D)2 type SMs based on the central Py unit are expected to exhibit better photovoltaic performance than DPP2An(2,6) in OPV devices. In this contribution, the effect of the central Ar unit and terminal D units on optical, thermal, electro-chemical, morphological and photovoltaic properties was primarily investigated. Our results show that DPP2Py showed an increased PCE of 5.67% compared to DPP2An(2,6) in OPV cells. Furthermore, ThDPP2Py showed a continuously improved PCE of 5.88% compared to DPP2Py in OPV cells. This indicates that tuning the central and terminal units can improve the photovoltaic performance of their SMs in solution processed SM-OPV cells.

2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials and synthesis
All reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. All reagents and solvents were purchased from Adamas, Sigma and Aldrich corporations. They were used without further purification unless stated otherwise. Compounds of DPP-Br, TPADPP-Br and Py(BPin)2 were prepared according to the reported procedures.54–57 The synthetic route is shown in Scheme 1 and their synthetic details are depicted in the ESI.†

2.2. Measurements and characterization

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz and 100 MHz on a Bruker Avance-400 spectrometer using CDCl3 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. Mass spectra (MS) were measured on a Bruker Daltonics BIFLEX III MALDI-TOF analyzer. Elemental analysis was performed on a Heraus CHN-Rapid elemental analyzer. UV-Vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Perkin-Elmer Diamond TG/DTA thermal analyzer at a scan rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement was made on a TA DSCQ10 instrument at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. The XRD pattern was recorded by using a Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer operating at 40 kV voltage and a 200 mA current with Cu Kα radiation. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted on a CHI620 voltammetric analyzer under an argon atmosphere in an anhydrous acetonitrile solution of tetra(n-butyl) ammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. A Pt plate, a Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working electrode, counter electrode, reference electrode, respectively. The SMs of DPP2Py, ThDPP2Py and TPADPP2Py were respectively coated on the Pt plate surface and all potentials were corrected against ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+).
2.3. Device fabrication and characterization
All devices were fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates, which were respectively cleaned under ultrasonic wave with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 20 min. Poly(3,4-ethylendioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios™ P Al 4083) was spin-coated onto ITO glass at 4000 rpm for 30 s and baked at 150 °C for 10 min in air. A solution of SMs and PC71BM in chloroform (12 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a photo-active layer. The thickness of the active layer was 70–110 nm measured by using a KLA Tencor D-120 profilometer. Ca (10 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited successively on the active layer by thermal evaporation under high vacuum (<2 × 10−6 mbar) to give an active area of 4 mm2 for each cell. Current density (J)–voltage (V) curves were measured under AM1.5G illumination from a calibrated solar simulator (New-port 150 W solar simulator) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the devices was measured on a solar spectral response measurement system QE-R3011 (Enli Technology). The hole mobility was measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method in the hole-only device with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SMs:PC71BM/Au. The film morphology was recorded by atomic force microscopy (AFM) on a Veeco DI multimode NS-3D apparatus in a trapping mode under normal air conditions using a 5 mm scanner at RT.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Thermal properties and crystallinity
The thermal properties of SMs were characterized by TGA and DSC measurements. The recorded TGA and DSC curves are respectively shown in Fig. S1 (see ESI†) and Fig. 2. The corresponding data are listed in Table 1. The decomposition temperatures (Td) of 394 °C, 383 °C and 404 °C are observed for DPP2Py, ThDPP2Py and TPADPP2Py at 5% weight loss, respectively, indicating that the three SMs are thermally stable enough for applications in solar cells. Two clear endothermic peaks at 246 °C and 268 °C, as well as two exothermic peaks at 235 °C and 244 °C, are shown for DPP2Py. This indicates that DPP2Py presented two kinds of crystallization states during the cooling process,58 which are different from those of the reported DPP2Ar analogies (Ar = phenyl, naphthyl, and anthryl). While terminal D units are attached, the ThDPP2Py shows increased endothermic and exothermic peaks at 251 and 237 °C, respectively. In contrast, TPADPP2Py exhibits decreasing endothermic and exothermic peaks at 223 °C and 173 °C, respectively. Therefore, introducing terminal D units into DPP2Py can tune the crystallinity of their resulting SMs.

To deeply investigate the crystallinity and molecular stacking of SMs, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of three pristine SM films spin-coated from 25 mg mL−1 CH3Cl solution was performed (Fig. 3). The three SMs display distinct strong peaks around 2θ = 6°, which are related to the distance between the planes of main conjugation chains in these SMs separated by alkyl chains, indicating that the three SMs possessed crystallinity. The corresponding d-spaces are 13.39 Å, 14.48 Å and 15.81 Å calculated by the Bragg equation (2dsinθ = nλ) for DPP2Py, ThDPP2Py and TPADPP2Py, respectively. It is found that the d-spaces of ThDPP2Py and TPADPP2Py are larger than that of DPP2Py. Moreover, more complicated peaks appeared in the DPP2Py based XRD curve. This indicates that DPP2Py with an A–Ar–A framework has stronger crystallinity than the D(A–Ar)2 type SMs of ThDPP2Py and TPADPP2Py, which is consistent with their DSC analysis. Introducing the terminal 2-octylthiophene and triphenylamine units can increase the d-spaces and decrease the interchain interactions of their SMs.

3.2. Optoelectronic properties
UV-Vis absorption spectra of three SMs in chloroform (CHCl3) solution and in their neat films are displayed in Fig. 4. The UV-Vis absorption data are listed in Table 2. A typical high-lying absorption band in a range of 300–450 nm for the π–π* electron transition and another strong low-lying absorption band in a range of 450–750 nm for the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition are observed in these absorption spectra. The significant influence of terminal D units on absorption spectra is shown. Compared to DPP2Py, ThDPP2Py and TPADPP2Py exhibit a significantly red-shifted absorption profile by 50 nm owing to the extending π-conjugated system and increasing electron-donating ability of the terminal 2-octylthiophene and triphenylamine units. Moreover, the absorption profiles of these films further show a strong red shift by 60 nm in contrast to those in their corresponding solutions due to the additional intermolecular interaction in the neat films. A new shoulder peak simultaneously occurs in the long-wavelength region, which results from vibronic coupling related to the solid-state packing. The optical band gaps estimated from the film absorption edge are 1.76 eV, 1.70 eV and 1.66 eV for DPP2Py, ThDPP2Py and TPADPP2Py, respectively. Therefore, introducing the terminal 2-octylthiophene and triphenylamine units into DPP2Py can efficiently decrease the optical band gaps of their resulting SMs.

3.3. Electrochemical properties

Fig. 5 shows the CV curves of the three SMs versus Ag/AgCl electrode. The electrochemical data are shown in Table 2. The quasi-reversible oxidation curves are displayed, in which the onset oxidation potential (Eox) is 0.88 V, 0.80 V and 0.66 V, respectively for DPP2Py, ThDPP2Py and TPADPP2Py. According to the traditional equation,59 the highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) energy levels of DPP2Py, ThDPP2Py and TPADPP2Py are calculated to be −5.25, −5.17 and −5.03 V, respectively. The lower HOMO energy level is shown for DPP2Py instead of ThDPP2Py and TPADPP2Py. This implies that attaching the electron-rich 2-octylthiophene and triphenylamine units can cause their molecules to be oxidized easier and result in an increasing HOMO energy level. Compared with the reported analogues of DPP2Ar (Ar = 1,4-phenylene, 2,6-naphthalene and 2,6-anthracene), it is found that DPP2Py exhibits a slightly decreasing HOMO energy level instead. Therefore, properly extending the aryl ring can also decrease the HOMO energy level of the A–Ar–A type SMs to some extent. Fig. 6 shows device energy levels. As the LUMO energy levels of SMs are respectively −3.49, −3.47 and −3.37 eV for DPP2Py, ThDPP2Py and TPADPP2Py, calculated by their corresponding optical band gap and HOMO energy level, this indicates that these SMs and the fullerene derivative acceptor PC71BM have matched HOMO and LUMO energy levels, which can promote charge carrier transfer and separation and then prompt their OPV cells to exhibit excellent photovoltaic properties.

3.4. Photovoltaic properties
In order to optimize the photovoltaic performance of three SM-based OPV cells, the SM/PC71BM ratios were tuned from 1:1, 1.5:1 to 2:1 under the existence of 1% 1,8-di-iodooctane (DIO) concentration. Fig. S2–S4 (see ESI†) show the recorded J–V curves of the SM-based OPV cells with different SM/PC71BM ratios at 1% DIO concentration. Tables S1–S3 (see ESI†) summarize the corresponding photovoltaic data. An optimized SM/PC71BM ratio of 1:1 is obtained for the three SM based cells. At this optimized SM/PC71BM ratio of 1:1, the influence of DIO concentrations from 0, 1% to 1.5% on photovoltaic performance is also depicted in Tables S1–S3.† The optimized DIO concentration of 1% is obtained. Fig. 7 and Table 3 show the J–V curves and photovoltaic data of the optimized OPV cells at a SM/PC71BM ratio of 1:1 and a DIO concentration of 1%. It is obvious that attaching 2-octylthiophene instead of triphenylamine units to the DPP2Py terminals is more available to improve the PCE, Jsc and FF values. A notably increased PCE of 5.88% with a Jsc of 15.35 mA cm−2 and a FF of 57.89% is obtained for the ThDPP2Py-based OPV cell under the optimized processing conditions. The PCE and Jsc levels here are much higher than the corresponding ones of the majority of the DPP-based SMs in OPV cells. The improvement of Jsc is attributed to the extended absorption bands, resulting from appending 2-octylthiophene to the end of DPP2Py. The increased FF value is assigned to the less charge recombination and more efficient charge transport, which is related to their better film morphologies discussed below.

It is surprising that thermal annealing at 110 °C for 10 minutes only has a positive effect on the photovoltaic performance of the DPP2Py-based OPV cells, but makes the ThDPP2Py- and TPADPP2Py-based OPV cells exhibit some reduced photovoltaic performances under the above optimized processing conditions as summarized in Tables S1–S3.† A significantly increased PCE value from 4.76% to 5.67% is obtained for the DPP2Py-based OPV cell after the thermal annealing process. In contrast, the ThDPP2Py-based OPV cell presents a decreased PCE value from 5.88% to 4.63% under the same processing conditions.
The photovoltaic performance of DPP2Py and its DPP2Ar analogues is summarized in Table S4 and shown in Fig. S5 (see ESI†). By a brief comparison, it is found that the DPP2Py-based OPV cells exhibit more increasing PCE values than the reported DPP2Ar-based ones. Therefore, properly extending the central aryl ring can efficiently improve the photovoltaic performance of these A–Ar–A type SMs.
On the other hand, it is noticed that the DPP2Py-based OPV cell exhibits a PCE of 4.76% under the optimized processing conditions without the post-treatment of thermal annealing, which is lower than that (5.88%) of the ThDPP2Py-based OPV cell, but higher than that (4.26%) of the TPADPP2Py-based OPV cell. This indicates that appending terminal donor units have remarkably different influences on the photovoltaic performance of these Ar(A–D)2 type SMs. Attaching 2-octylthiophene rather than triphenylamine as the terminal donor group to the parent A–Ar–A type SMs is available to significantly increase the PCE value of its resulting SMs in OPV cells.
In order to in-depth understand why the ThDPP2Py-based OPV cell exhibits the highest Jsc level, but the TPADPP2Py-based OPV cell exhibits the lowest Jsc level among these OPV cells, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the three SM/PC71BM blend films were measured and are shown in Fig. 8 under the optimized processing conditions. Broad photo-response areas from 300 to 750 nm are observed with various photo-response efficiencies. The average EQE values of 63.3%, 77.5% and 49.2% are shown for the DPP2Py, ThDPP2Py and TPADPP2Py based blend films with PC71BM, respectively. It is obvious that the ThDPP2Py blend film displays the highest photo-response efficiency compared to the TPADPP2Py and DPP2Py blend films. The corresponding Jsc values of the DPP2Py, ThDPP2Py and TPADPP2Py based cells are 10.87, 15.05 and 10.23 mA cm−2 estimated by integrating the EQE spectra, which are consistent with the Jsc values obtained from the J–V measurements with little error below 5%. Therefore, attaching 2-octylthiophene instead of triphenylamine units to the DPP2Py terminals can enhance the photo-response efficiency of its SM in the PC71BM blend film. As a result, the ThDPP2Py/PC71BM based OPV cell displays the highest Jsc value.

3.5. Film morphology
The morphologies of the SM/PC71BM blend films were investigated by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM), in order to illustrate that adding DIO is favorable for improving the cell's photovoltaic performance. Fig. 9 shows the AFM height images (5 × 5 μm) of the SM/PC71BM blend films at the optimized SM/PC71BM ratios with/without adding DIO additive. A serious phase separation state is observed with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 4.63 nm, 8.69 nm and 11.81 nm for the DPP2Py, ThDPP2Py and TPADPP2Py based blend films without DIO additive, respectively. At the same time, huge domains over 100 nm are present in these SM/PC71BM blend films, which should increase the probability of charge carrier recombination before charge carriers reach the SM/PC71BM interface and diminish the exciton separation at the SM/PC71BM interface. Therefore, the huge domains should make these OPV cells exhibit lower Jsc and PCE.60 When 1% DIO additive is added, these SM/PC71BM blend films show a smoother surface with decreased RMS values of 2.87 nm, 4.44 nm and 1.28 nm for the DPP2Py, ThDPP2Py and TPADPP2Py based blend films, respectively. Furthermore, uniform morphologies and appropriate domain sizes are simultaneously observed for these SM/PC71BM blend films under the DIO additive's effect, which are available for charge carrier separation and transportation and more significant improvement of Jsc and PCE.61 Fig. S6† further shows the AFM phase images (5 × 5 μm) of the SM/PC71BM blend films at the optimized SM/PC71BM ratios with/without adding DIO additive in the ESI.† It is noteworthy that the ThDPP2Py/PC71BM blend film with 1% DIO additive reveals the best morphology with some ordered nano-fiber structures and a bicontinuous network. Therefore, attaching 2-octylthiophene instead of triphenylamine units to the parent DPP2Py terminals can improve the morphology of its SM in the PC71BM blend film. It is interesting that only the DPP2Py/PC71BM blend film with 1% DIO displays an improved morphology after thermal annealing these blend films, as shown in Fig. S6.† The ordered nanostructure with nano-fibers and a smaller RMS value of 2.11 nm appears for the DPP2Py/PC71BM blend film after annealing. This more explains why the DPP2Py based OPV cell presents, but the ThDPP2Py and TPADPP2Py based OPV cells have not presented enhanced photovoltaic performance after a thermal annealing process.

3.6. Hole mobility
The hole mobility is an important parameter for photovoltaic materials. Therefore, we measured the hole mobility of the three SMs in their hole-only devices with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SMs:PC71BM/Au by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The SM:PC71BM photo-active layers in the hole-only devices were made under the same optimized conditions for the OPV cells. Fig. 10 shows the J–V characteristics of these hole-only SM:PC71BM based devices in the dark. Hole mobilities of 8.47 × 10−4, 2.88 × 10−4 and 2.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 are calculated for DPP2Py, ThDPP2Py and TPADPP2Py based cells according to the Mott-Gurney equation,62 respectively. These comparable hole mobilities, as well as the optimal nanoscale morphology with appropriate domain sizes and the ordered nanofibrillars, contribute to the good photovoltaic performance of the A–Ar–A and Ar(A–D)2 type SM based OPV cells under the given optimized processing conditions.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, three SMs of DPP2Py, ThDPP2Py and TPADPP2Py were obtained with an A–Ar–A or Ar(A–D)2 framework. The significant influence of the central aryl ring and appending terminal units on optical, electrochemical, morphological and photovoltaic properties was revealed. ThDPP2Py based on the 2-octylthiophene terminal exhibited better photovoltaic performance than DPP2Py. In contrast, TPADPP2Py containing the triphenylamine terminal displayed decreasing photovoltaic performance compared to DPP2Py. The maximum PCE of 5.88% with a Jsc of 15.35 mA cm−2, and a FF of 57.89% was obtained for the ThDPP2Py based OPV cells. Our research demonstrated that properly extending the central aryl ring and attaching appropriate terminal units in the A–Ar–A type SMs can significantly improve the photovoltaic performance of the resulting Ar(A–D)2 type SMs.
