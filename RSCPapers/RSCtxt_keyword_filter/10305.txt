The photovoltaic performance of this polymer could be improved by incorporating fluorine atoms into the quinoxaline units, resulting in an efficiency of 6.32%. This result highlights the attractive promise of D–A1–D–A2 copolymers for high-performance bulk heterojunction solar cells.
Over the last decade, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been intensively developed with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) improving from 2% to 10%.1 This great progress could be registered not only from a better understanding and control of charge generation and transportation, but also due to the development of a wide array of novel donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers.1 The combination of electron-rich units as donors and electron-deficient units as acceptors, forming internal donor–acceptor structures, was proved to be an effective method to develop low band gap polymers.1a,2 Numerous D–A polymers were designed and synthesized, which exhibited quite high performances when used as donors in PSCs.1–3 The photophysical and electronic properties of the D–A polymers are determined by the donor and acceptor units. However, alternating copolymers containing two acceptor units, forming D–A1–D–A2 structures, were rarely investigated for their application in PSCs. Very recently, we have shown the advantages of the D–A1–D–A2 strategy by demonstrating the improved performance of PTQTI (cf. Scheme 1) over the conventional D–A polymer TQ1 and PTI-1.4 In such a case, the absorption spectra and electronic properties of the copolymer can be tuned by the second acceptor unit. The performance of the copolymer is higher compared to its constituent parts D–A1 and D–A2 polymers. Moreover, we have shown that compared to the random copolymer PTQTI-R with two acceptor units, the alternating copolymer PTQTI possessed regioregular structure, which is beneficial for π-stacking.

Recently, conjugated polymers with fluorine substitution were shown to have higher performance compared to their non-fluorinated analogues.5 The incorporation of fluorine atoms into D–A polymers can simultaneously lower the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, maintaining almost the same optical band gap compared to their corresponding non-fluorinated analogues.5 Benefiting from the lower HOMO levels, solar cells comprising fluorinated polymers exhibited higher open-circuit voltage (Voc).5,6 In some cases, fluorinated polymers also showed improved short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), which were attributed to high mobilities and/or better morphology.5a,6a It was also reported that fluorine substitution on quinoxaline units can improve the performance of the resulting polymers.6b,7 Encouraged by these results from the literature, we prepared a D–A1–D–A2 copolymer PTQTI-F by attaching two fluorine atoms to the quinoxaline unit of PTQTI. PTQTI-F exhibited a higher photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 6.32% compared to its non-fluorinated analog PTQTI with a PCE of 4.82%. This is the highest efficiency registered for a D–A1–D–A2 type of polymer, which highlights the great potential of such polymers for highly efficient solar cells.
The synthesis of the polymers PTQTI and PTQTI-F is shown in Scheme 1. The preparation of monomers 1 and 3 was described in our previous publication.4 Compound 2 was synthesized starting from the commercially available compound 1,4-dibromo-2,3-difluorobenzene. Thus, 1,4-dibromo-2,3-difluorobenzene was nitrated with a mixture of fuming nitric acid and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid8 to afford 1,4-dibromo-2,3-difluoro-5,6-dinitrobenzene in high yield (75.2%). The commonly used nitrating mixture comprising of fuming nitric acid and fuming sulfuric acid was avoided because it yielded a mixture of the mono- and dinitro-compounds which were difficult to separate.5b,8 1,4-Dibromo-2,3-difluoro-5,6-dinitrobenzene was reduced with iron and condensed with 1,2-bis(3-octyloxyphenyl)ethane-1,2-dione to afford 5,8-dibromo-6,7-difluoro-2,3-bis(3-octyloxyphenyl)quinoxaline. The details of the synthesis of monomer 2 are described in the ESI.† Both PTQTI and PTQTI-F were synthesized by the Suzuki coupling reaction as depicted in Scheme 1. Both of them are readily soluble in organic solvents such as chloroform, toluene and o-dichlorobenzene (oDCB). The molecular weights of the two polymers were determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). The fluorinated polymer PTQTI-F exhibited a lower number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 58000 with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 3.0 compared to PTQTI with a Mn of 76000 and a PDI of 3.7. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed that there was no obvious thermal transition in the range of 20–320 °C for the two polymers.
The absorption spectra of the two polymers, both in chloroform solution and in the solid state, are shown in Fig. 1. Both polymers show two absorption bands. The strong low-energy band can be attributed to strong intramolecular charge transfer interaction between the electron-rich and electron-deficient units. Although absorption onsets of D–A1–D–A2 copolymers were mainly determined by the stronger electron-deficient units (isoindigo is stronger than quinoxaline),9 the fluorinated quinoxaline-containing polymer PTQTI-F showed a clear blue shift compared to PTQTI, which means fluorine substitution on weaker acceptor units may still have visible influence on the photophysical properties of the resulting D–A1–D–A2 copolymers. Similar blue shifts have been observed in some other fluorinated D–A polymer systems.1b,5b,10 Density functional theory (DFT) calculation showed that the introduction of fluorine atoms onto quinoxaline does not increase the torsion angle of the polymer backbone (cf. ESI,† Fig. S2 side views of the simulated molecular geometries of PTQTI and PTQTI-F). A plausible explanation for the planarity of fluorinated polymers is the strong interaction between fluorine atoms and C-4 hydrogens on the thiophene rings.11

To investigate the influence of fluorine substitutions on the frontier energy levels of the copolymer, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed. The details of the CV measurements and the calculation method of HOMO and LUMO levels from CV results are described in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 2, the oxidation onset of PTQTI-F is 0.1 V higher than that of PTQTI measured under the same conditions. As a result, PTQTI-F exhibits a HOMO level of −5.90 eV and a LUMO level of −3.97 eV as deduced from CV measurements, which are ∼0.1 eV lower than those of PTQTI (HOMO of −5.80 eV and LUMO of −3.90 eV). This trend is also consistent with DFT calculation (HOMO of −5.01 eV and LUMO of −2.96 eV for PTQTI-F, and HOMO of −4.90 eV and LUMO of −2.90 eV for PTQTI). Previous studies4,9 revealed that the LUMO levels of copolymers were mainly determined by the stronger acceptor units. However, the results described above clearly indicate the influence of fluorine substitution of weaker acceptor units on the energy levels of the D–A1–D–A2 copolymer.

For comparison of the photovoltaic performances of the two donor polymers, conventional bulk heterojunction solar cell devices were fabricated with [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as an acceptor. The devices had a configuration of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC61BM/Ca/Al and were tested under the illumination of AM 1.5G simulated solar light (100 mW cm−2). Based on our previous studies,4,12 the optimized D:A ratio of 1:1, processing solvent of 2.5% (wt) of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) in oDCB and an active layer thickness of ∼100 nm were used in this work. Moreover, PC61BM was chosen as the acceptor instead of PC71BM, as the morphology of polymer:PC61BM was better in this case.4,13 The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves for solar cells based on the two polymers are shown in Fig. 3 and the corresponding external quantum efficiency (EQE) profiles are shown in Fig. 4. PTQTI presents a PCE of 4.82% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.40 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.52 and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.82 V. This result is close to our previous result with a PCE of 5.03% regardless of the difference in cathode material (calcium in this work and LiF in previous work).4 PTQTI-F exhibited a higher Voc of 0.93 V, an enhanced Jsc of 12.58 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.54, resulting in an increased PCE of 6.32%. The increased Voc can be attributed to its deeper HOMO level, which is also observed in other fluorinated D–A polymer systems.1b,5,6 It is striking to note that the fluorinated D–A1–D–A2 copolymer PTQTI-F exhibited a much higher performance than its constituent parts polymers, i.e., TQ-F (D–A1)10 with a PCE of 1.5% and PTI-1 (D–A2)13,14 with a PCE of 4.5%. These results highlight the advantages of D–A1–D–A2 copolymers, which are promising materials for efficient solar cells.

As shown in Fig. 4, the EQE of PTQTI-F is higher over a wide range compared to PTQTI, although it has a slightly narrower photoresponse window, which is consistent with its slightly blue-shifted absorption spectrum (cf. Fig. 1). To find the reason for the enhanced photoresponse of PTQTI-F, we investigated the morphologies of the active layers by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Films made of both PTQTI:PC61BM and PTQTI-F:PC61BM blends were very smooth with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of ∼1.6 nm. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the PTQTI-F-based film showed more fabric-like domains compared to PTQTI-based film. This implies that a continuous interpenetrated network formed in PTQTI-F-based film, which is favorable for charge transportation. Therefore, the enhanced photocurrent of PTQTI-F can be partially attributed to the improved morphology of the PTQTI-F:PC61BM blend.5a,6a
In conclusion, a new fluorinated D–A1–D–A2 copolymer PTQTI-F was synthesized. Bulk heterojunction solar cells fabricated with this polymer as a donor and PC61BM as an acceptor realized a PCE of 6.32%, which is the highest efficiency recorded for a polymer containing two acceptor units. Moreover, enhancement of the Voc by 0.1 V was achieved by PTQTI-F compared to non-fluorine substituted analogues due to its deeper HOMO level. Thus, fluorine substitution on the weaker acceptor unit is a useful strategy to fine-tune energy levels of D–A1–D–A2 copolymers.
