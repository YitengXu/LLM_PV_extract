    , Accepted 14th March 2019First published on 21st March 2019AbstractPbS quantum dots (QDs) have been used extensively in optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, photodetectors and phototransistors. However, the mobility of charges in PbS QD solid films still limits their performance in many optoelectronic applications. To improve the PbS QD optoelectronic device performance, a small amount of PbSe QDs was mixed into PbS QDs to form a mixed quantum dot solution for fabrication of solar cells and photodetectors. Improvement in charge mobility arises from the higher mobility in PbSe QDs than in PbS, due to their larger exciton radius. The power conversion efficiency of the mixed QD solar cells (mixed PbS and PbSe) improved to 9.4%, compared to 8.8% for a pure PbS QD solar cell and 7.8% for a pure PbSe QD solar cell. Photodetectors were used to investigate the responsivity of pure PbS and the mixed QD photodetector, showing that the responsivity of the mixed QD photodetector was improved to 1.50 from 1.20 μA W−1. Finally, field effect transistors were used to determine the carrier mobility of PbS, PbSe and their mixtures, demonstrating that the PbSe carrier mobility, at 0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1, was 8-fold higher than that of pure PbS, at 0.004 cm2 V−1 s−1. The mixed film mobility at 0.006 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 5% PbSe:PbS devices was also higher than that of pure PbS by ∼50%. Overall, the improved device performance is attributed to the improved mobility of mixed QD films due to the presence of PbSe. This leads to the formation of a larger electronic coupling between neighbouring nanocrystals, facilitating charge transport.
Introduction
Lead chalcogenide quantum dots (QDs) have long been promising materials for photovoltaic (PV) devices.1–9 This is due to their suitable bandgap for light harvesting, low-cost solution processing and favourable charge transport resulting from large exciton Bohr radii in several species (PbS 18 nm, PbSe 47 nm and PbTe 150 nm).10,11 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) and ambient stability of PbS QD solar cells have also improved significantly over the past 5 years.8,12–15 Recently, a certified 12.01% PCE of PbS QD solar cells has been achieved through a series of evolving improvements in ligand engineering and device structure.7 However, the efficiency of PbS QD solar cells still lags behind that of commercial solar cell materials, such as silicon, CdTe, CIGS thin films, and perovskite solar cells.16 The carrier mobility of PbS QD films, which determines the diffusion length of photogenerated carriers, is one of the factors limiting the performance of PbS QD solar cells.17,18
In the past few decades, the carrier mobility of PbS QD films has increased considerably by step-wise improvements in ligand engineering. Starting from the use of organic ligands such as 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA),19 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT),20 and butylamine,21 newer treatments have been found to be more effective, including salt halides such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB),22 tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI)2 and PbI2.3,4 Currently, the value of the carrier mobility in PbS has improved from 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, an increase of three orders of magnitude.23 This means that the mobility in PbS solid films is now competitive with those of many organic polymer photovoltaic (PV) materials,24,25 but is still much lower than that of the competing energy materials such as organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, CdTe and CIGS.16 PbSe QDs demonstrate a higher mobility than PbS QDs, due to the stronger electron coupling that arises from the larger Bohr exciton radius of PbSe.11 Recently, Q. Lin et al. reported a lead chalcogenide quantum dot field effect transistor to determine the carrier mobilities of PbS, PbSe and PbTe films, demonstrating that the PbSe mobility is two orders of magnitude higher than that of PbS.5 To improve the PbS QD mobility as well as its device performance, Ma et al. achieved better device performance in photovoltaic applications using PbS1−xSex alloyed QDs as the absorbing layer, compared to pure PbS or PbSe quantum dot solar cells.10 However, the alloyed QDs synthesized in that work needed to be used under air-free conditions, which somewhat limits their range of potential applications. Recently, J. Zhang et al. obtained PbSe QD solar cells with 6.2% PCE and improved air stability by coating the surface of the PbSe QDs with bound Cl and Cd atoms.26 Moreover, Z. Zhang et al. have developed a new path to passivate the PbSe quantum dot surface states, which has significantly improved the device performance to an efficiency of 8.2%.27 In our own previous study, we have further improved the solar cell's performance with 9.2% PCE and improved stability using mixed perovskite passivated PbSe QDs.28 Due to the higher mobility and improved stability of PbSe QDs, these works suggest that simply mixing PbSe QDs into the active layer could lead to PbS QD PVs with enhanced performance.
To date, there has been much less research on optoelectronic devices of mixed nanocrystals for field effect transistors, photodetectors and solar cells than on pure materials. He et al. reported PbS QD photodetectors obtained by mixing Ag nanoparticles into the QD film, thus enhancing device performance by suppressing the dark current and improving the photocurrent.29 Yang et al. fabricated mixed quantum dot solar cells using different ligand treatments for PbS quantum dots, leading to improved performance due to the formation of a quantum dot bulk heterojunction.30 Here, mixed QDs of PbS and PbSe were used to manufacture photovoltaic cells with enhanced charge transport due to the stronger electronic coupling in PbSe QDs. Five batches of solar cells were produced based on varying the weight percentage of PbS to PbSe QDs as follows: 100:0 (pure PbS), 97:3 (3% PbSe mixed), 95:5 (5% PbSe mixed), 90:10 (10% PbSe mixed) and 0:100 (pure PbSe). QD solar cells based on 5% PbSe in PbS QDs achieved 9.4% PCE, significantly better than the photovoltaic devices based on pure PbS and pure PbSe, which achieved 8.8% and 7.8% PCEs, respectively. This represents a 0.6% net improvement in PCE based on mixing of lead chalcogenides in a QD solar cell. Field effect transistors were fabricated to investigate the carrier mobility of pure PbS, pure PbSe and their mixtures. Photoconductive photodetectors using these mixed QD films were then used to investigate the light responsivity and photoluminescence decay measurements were performed to determine the carrier lifetime of the solid film. These measurements suggest that the mechanism of the improved performance is due to the improved mobility in the mixed QD film.
Results and discussion
PbS quantum dots were synthesized by an adapted hot injection method,3,4 and PbSe QDs were synthesized using a cation exchange method similar to those previously reported.26,27 The incorporation of 3%, 5% and 10% PbSe QDs into PbS QDs was done by adding a desired amount of PbSe QDs into a PbS QD solution. Ultraviolet–visible–near infrared (UV-vis-NIR) spectrum absorbance measurements were carried out on QD hexane solutions as shown in Fig. 1a, demonstrating the absorption curves of five samples of QDs. The first excitonic peaks of the five samples are located at 910 nm, suggesting that they all have the same bandgaps of ∼1.36 eV. This helps in excluding the possibility of alloy formation of PbS1−xSex since the absorption peaks of the mixed quantum dot solutions are a linear combination of the two samples, while alloying would change the peak of the lowest energy transition. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements were also performed on the five samples, as shown in Fig. 1b. The PL peak of pure PbS quantum dots is centered at 1020 nm, whereas the PL peak of pure PbSe QDs is centered at 1035 nm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of PbS and PbSe QDs are provided in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. These images demonstrate that PbS QDs have a size distribution of 3.0 ± 0.3 nm while PbSe QDs have a size distribution of 2.8 ± 0.5 nm, which shows that PbSe QDs have a larger size distribution than PbS QDs. The PL peaks of the mixed QDs shift slightly to longer wavelengths with increasing percentages of PbSe QDs and the PL intensity decreases slightly probably due to the average larger size distribution in the mixed QD samples.

Five batches of solar cells made from the same five QD samples were used to investigate device performance. Two layers of ZnO nanocrystal films were deposited onto patterned ITO glass substrates using a sol–gel spin-coating method and annealed in air under ambient conditions.31 The five samples of QDs were then spin-coated onto five separate devices coated with the ZnO films. These were then treated with a 10 mM PbI2 DMF solution (PbI2 was dissolved in DMF solvent) and rinsed with acetonitrile by soaking similar to previous reports.3,4 This procedure was repeated 6 times to obtain QD layers with a thickness of 200 nm. After this, two layers of pure PbS QDs with 50 nm thickness were spin-coated on PbI2 treated QD layers and treated with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) to act as a hole transport layer in the device. Finally, gold electrodes, with a thickness of approximately 100 nm, were deposited onto the PbS QD layer by thermal evaporation. The final device configuration was ITO/ZnO/mixed QD-PbI2/PbS-EDT/Au. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of completed devices made from 5% mixed PbSe QDs is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Current density–voltage (J–V) measurements were performed on five batches of QD solar cells as shown in Fig. 2a. The pure PbS QD device achieved a 9.0% power conversion efficiency with the highest Voc being 0.62 V and lowest Jsc at 22.6 mA cm−2. These results were in good agreement with previous reports in the literature, which reported that PbS QD solar cells, with a similar configuration and thickness of active layers, had achieved comparable device performance.14,32,33 Detailed characteristics of the solar cells described in this work are given in Table 1. The pure PbSe QD solar cells achieved 7.8% PCE, with a peak Jsc of 25.3 mA cm−2 but a low Voc of only 0.49 V, which again agrees with previous reports for this type of device.27,28 The solar cells making use of 5% PbSe mixed QD films demonstrated 9.4% PCE with a significantly improved Jsc of 24.8 mA cm−2 and a slightly smaller Voc of 0.60 V compared with the pure PbS QD solar cells. In contrast, the 10% PbSe mixed QD solar cells achieved 8.2% PCE with a slightly increased Jsc of 24.4 mA cm−2 but reduced Voc of 0.54 V. In an n–i–p configuration solar cell, the holes and electrons drift in a built-in electric field (within the depletion region, as defined by the depletion length), diffuse into the quasi-neutral region (within the diffusion region, as defined by the diffusion length), and are collected by the corresponding electrodes.8,13 The depletion length in a PbSe QD solar cell is shorter than that in a PbS QD solar cell due to the lower built-in field, higher defect concentration and very similar dielectric constant, as was reported in the literature.34Fig. 2b shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the five kinds of pure and mixed QD solar cells. The pure PbSe solar cell demonstrates a higher quantum efficiency with over 90% EQE in the short wavelength region (λ < 600 nm), suggesting that a better charge transport occurs compared with that of the pure PbS QD solar cell. This is supported by the fact that both devices have the same thickness and have very similar absorption coefficients for both PbSe and PbS QD films. The absorption curves of PbS and PbSe are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). There the electrons drift from the built-in electric field and are then transported to the ETL of the ZnO film via diffusion. Thus at this junction the higher carrier mobility of the PbSe QD film increases the diffusion length as compared to PbS QDs. This improves the charge extraction efficiency as demonstrated by the improved EQE across the entire spectrum,2 specifically in the short-wave part of the spectrum. The improved Jsc in the 5% PbSe mixed solar cell is attributed to an increased carrier diffusion length resulting from enhanced carrier mobility via enhanced coupling in the PbSe QDs. The loss in Voc from pure PbS to pure PbSe films is most likely due to the increase in surface traps and incomplete passivation of the PbSe QDs. At 5% mixing, this effect becomes significant but is outweighed by the increase in Jsc.

To investigate the origin of the improved efficiency in mixed QD solar cells, two kinds of solar cells, pure PbS and 5% PbSe mixed solar cells, were studied further. First, to confirm the components of the QD film, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were performed on a pure PbS film and the 5% PbSe mixed film both having been treated with a PbI2 solution on ITO glass. Fig. 3a demonstrates the X-ray spectrum of the two samples of QD films, which shows strong peaks of lead and iodine. The core level XPS spectrum of Se 3d, as shown in Fig. 3b, exhibits a flat curve in the pure PbS QD film and a small peak in the mixed QD film, indicating that the mixed QD film contains elemental Se originating from the PbSe QDs, as expected.

Three kinds of field effect transistors were fabricated in order to investigate the carrier mobility of pure PbS, pure PbSe and 5% PbSe mixed QD thin films. Furthermore, two samples of photodetectors, based on pure PbS QDs and 5% mixed PbSe QDs, were fabricated to explore the light responsivity of the thin films under illumination. The devices were tested under illumination with a 760 nm light emitting diode (LED) at 3.6 μW cm−2, which was controlled by a function generator with 5 V bias. Dynamic current–time (I–t) measurements on these photodetectors are demonstrated in Fig. 4a. The PbS device shows a low photocurrent and low dark current, whereas the 5% PbSe mixed device shows a significantly improved photocurrent and a slightly increased dark current. The light responsivity, a metric of photodetector sensitivity,27,31 can be calculated using R = (Ip − Id)/Pin(1)where Ip is the photocurrent, Id is the dark current and Pin is the induced light power intensity. The responsivity is 1.2 mA W−1 for the pure PbS photodetector and 1.5 mA W−1 for the 5% PbSe mixed QD photodetector, respectively, representing a 25% improvement. The responsivity of both types of photodetectors is in good agreement with that previously reported,29,35 and the detailed characteristics of our devices and reported devices are given in Table S1 (ESI†). To exclude the possibility that higher responsivity might result from increased carrier trapping, the temporal response characteristics are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The slope absolute value of the 5% PbSe mixed solid film is greater than that of the pure PbS solid film, which suggests that the trap centres in the mixed solid film are not higher than those of the pure PbS solid film. Furthermore, the absorption coefficient is nearly unchanged between the two thin films, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), due to the very small amount of PbSe mixed into the film. We then used time-resolved photoluminescence measurements to determine the carrier lifetime of both films as shown in Fig. 4b. Bi-exponential functions were used to fit the curves and extract the lifetimes, resulting in a τ1 of 1.11 ns and τ2 of 3.6 ns for the PbS film and τ1 of 1.10 ns and τ2 of 3.7 ns for the 5% PbSe mixed film. This suggests that the recombination rate in pure PbS and mixed PbSe QD films is very similar. This excludes the possibility that the improved device performance in the solar cells and photodetectors is attributed to the reduced recombination rate. Therefore, we suppose that the improved mobility in the 5% PbSe mixed QD film is responsible for the observed enhancement in the device performance of both the solar cells and photodetectors.

Three samples of FET devices were fabricated to investigate the carrier mobility of pure PbS, pure PbSe and 5% PbSe mixed solid film, which was reported in many references4,5. The transfer curves of the FETs are shown in Fig. 5, which demonstrate that all of them have n-type semiconductor characteristics. The carrier mobility can be calculated using eqn (2): μ = L/(WVdsε0εr/d)dIds/dVg,(2)where the channel length (L) is 150 μm, the channel width (W) is 10 μm, D is the thickness of a thin film of QDs, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity of 8.854 × 10−12 F m−1, εr is the dielectric constant (3.9 for SiO2), and d is the thickness of SiO2 (300 nm). Pure PbSe QD thin films had the highest mobility of 0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1, the mixed QD film had a medium mobility of 0.006 cm2 V−1 s−1, while pure PbS had the lowest mobility of 0.004 cm2 V−1 s−1. These results are in good agreement with the literature.5,34 The mobility of the pure PbSe QD solid film shows a nearly 7-fold higher value than that of PbS QDs, while the mobility of the 5% PbSe mixed QD solid films shows a 50% improvement over the same. Eventually, the improved mobility enhances the device performance in the solar cells and photodetectors.

Conclusion
In summary, this is, somewhat surprisingly, the first report on using mixed films of lead chalcogenide quantum dots to create optoelectronic devices with improved performance. The mixed PbSe/PbS QD films demonstrated a 50% improvement in carrier mobility compared with pure PbS QD films. This leads to an improved efficiency of solar cells and the responsivity of photodetectors made of these mixed QD films, eventually leading to a 0.6% net increase in the solar cell PCE of the respective champion devices. These results add a new wrinkle to the ongoing effort to improve optoelectronic device performance via QD film engineering. By mixing QDs, we have shown that we can create films with intermediate properties that can then display enhanced performance.
