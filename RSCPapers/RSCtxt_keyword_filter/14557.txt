    , Accepted 15th December 2015First published on 15th December 2015AbstractTextile fabric electrodes have attained increasing demand as they offer the benefits of light weight, flexibility, and low cost. In this work, we fabricated an activated charcoal doped multi walled carbon nanotube (AC doped MWCNT) hybrid and printed on polyester woven fabric. This carbon fabric composite was used as a counter electrode (CE) in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), so as to replace expensive platinized FTO (fluorinated tin oxide) glass. A variety of mesoporous carbon structures were synthesized by using different types of charcoal together with MWCNTs. Morphological characterization revealed that the highly porous defect rich carbon structure consists of synchronized features of 3D carbon decorated with the MWCNT network. The excessive oxygen surface groups can reduce a large amount of polymer gel electrolyte and locate manifold catalytic sites for the reduction of tri-iodide (I3−). Electrochemical investigations confirmed that this carbon fabric composite has high electrocatalytic activity (ECA) and exhibited a very low charge transfer resistance (RCT) of 1.38 Ω. The resulting N719 DSSCs consisting of this unique carbon coated textile fabric CE filled with the polymeric electrolyte show a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.29%, outperforming the platinized FTO glass CE. Such facile assembly of this novel textile fabric CE is quite promising for the mass production of next generation textile structured solar cells.
1. Introduction
Textile based electrodes have received much attention due to their potential application in super capacitors,1–4 lithium ion batteries,5–7 and electrochemical energy storage devices.8–10 These electronic textiles (e-textiles) offer the combined features of light weight, flexibility and charge storage capacity.11–15 In photovoltaic devices, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have received much attention due to their low cost, high sustainability, and easy fabrication.16–18 A standard DSSC consists of n-type TiO2 nanocrystalline semiconductor oxide particulates as the anode electrode and platinized FTO glass as the cathode separated by an I−/I3− redox couple electrolyte. Typical DSSCs suffer from stability problems which result from the use of platinized fluorinated tin oxide (FTO) glass causing low sustainability.19 However, commercial application of platinized CEs is restricted by their high cost and high energy consuming preparation (sputtering and thermal decomposition). Consequently, extensive research has been carried out for the progress of platinized FTO free CEs in DSSCs. Recently, fabrication of flexible carbon fabric composites has gained widespread attention due to their high conductivity, low cost, and environmental sustainability. Synthesized micro and nano-patterned carbon structures based on carbon nanotubes, carbon black, graphite, and graphene have been assembled on a fabric substrate and used as efficient CE substrates.20–26
Multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are a unique nano scale structure, consisting of several coaxially arranged graphene sheets with distinct electronic features of high electrical conductivity, and chemical stability. MWCNTs are made up of nearly perfect atomically smooth basal planes which may not be suitable for efficient electro-catalytic application.27 Amorphous activated charcoal has a high surface area with a porous structure, and possess a multi-edge surface that can act as active centers for the charge storage reactions.28,29 Induction of mesoporous activated carbon into the tubular graphitic framework without altering their electronic conductivity could yield electrocatalytic active sites with a minimum change of conjugation length. The synchronized structure of defect rich carbon with the conductive MWCNT network supports to facilitate the charge transfer kinetics, and improve the device photovoltaic efficiency.
Textile fabrics are porous and stretchable made by weaving, knitting, or pressing fibers. Among the fabrics, polyester fabric is indeed the most commonly used because of its high strength, flexibility, and low production cost. In this paper, we report a novel textile fabric CE employing a polyester fabric as the substrate, and the AC doped MWCNT as the catalytic coating, which is synthesized by an enzymatic dispersion route, reported in our previous work.30 We fabricated different composite structures of AC doped MWCNT printed polyester fabric (carbon fabric composites) using coal, coconut shell and pine tree type activated carbon, designated as composite A, composite B and composite C, respectively. Further, different amounts of AC (pine tree) were formulated to optimize the hybrid structure. Electrochemical studies revealed the high electrocatalytic activity and conductivity of our suggested textile CE. Further, DSSCs were fabricated with FTO based anodes and carbon fabric composite CEs. The polyethylene oxide based gel electrolyte was used to avoid the electrolyte leakage. The initial photovoltaic results showed that the carbon fabric composite prepared with 0.8% AC exhibited high photovoltaic performance with 7.29% efficiency, outperforming platinized FTO with 7.16% PCE. The achieved PCE is among the highly efficient N719 DSSCs using fabric based CEs. In flexible CEs, it was mainly the VOC and FF among photovoltaic parameters that affect the efficiency of the device. Briefly, the higher FF and VOC of our suggested carbon fabric composite is attributed to the strong adhesion of the carbon layer with the textile substrate, better sheet conductivity, and lower interfacial charge transfer resistance with the polymer gel electrolyte.
In addition to replacing Pt with the AC doped MWCNT as the electrocatalyst, the FTO substrate for the CE was also replaced by woven fabric to further reduce the cell internal resistance and thus improve the cell efficiency. Textile CE based DSSCs are expected to meet the various requirements of wearable electronic devices. These highly conductive and electrocatalytic active electrodes can be further fabricated into flexible transparent conductive glass (TCO) free DSSCs. In addition, the production of fabric based composites is very advanced in textile industries and can provide the benefit of roll-to roll production of flexible TCO free DSSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Plain weave 100% polyester fabrics with silicon hydrophobic surface finish were used as the substrate. Three types of activated charcoal particles derived from coal, coconut shell and pine tree were purchased from Dy-carbon Co. MWCNT powder of carbon content > 95%, 6–9 nm diameter, 5 μm length (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was used. Lipase enzyme from Candida rugosa, Type VII (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) was used as the organic dispersant. Polymer carboxymethyl cellulose (sodium salt of MW 250000 g) was used as the binding agent. For Pt CEs the conductive transparent glass (FTO TEC 8, Pilkington Co) substrate was used. Dye sensitizer D719, cis-di-isothiocyanato-bis(2,2′-bipyridyl 4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)-bis(tetra butyl ammonium) from Ever light Co was purchased. TiO2 (P25 by Degussa Co) of 20 nm size was used for photoanodes. Ionomer Surlyn of 60 μm thickness was purchased from Solaronix. Other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co.
2.2 Fabrication of carbon fabric composite counter electrodes
Different AC doped MWCNT nanostructures were synthesized as per the following steps. The schematic illustration of the synthesis process is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). First of all, 1 mg mL−1 aqueous enzymatic solution of lipase enzyme was prepared in ethanol. 0.4 g of MWCNT was added in 100 mL enzymatic solution and stirred at room temperature for 8 hours. The enzymes were physically entrapped and adsorbed onto the MWCNT surface. Entrapped enzyme molecules substantially loosen the aggregation of MWCNTs without compromising their electronic structure features. In the next step, different types of activated charcoal particles i.e. coal, coconut shell, and pine tree type were added into the individual MWCNT suspension and further dispersed for 8 hours. To facilitate the doping of activated charcoal into the tubular graphitic structure of the MWCNT, further 50 mL ethanol was added to dilute the suspension and ultra-sonicated for at least 3 hours. Using ultrasonication, the large size charcoal particles break up and started induction into the MWCNT network. The suspension was vacuum filtered by using a 0.5 μm pore size PTFE polymer membrane filter. After that, the carbon filtrate was washed two times with D.I water to remove any excess of non-adsorbed enzyme impurities. Next, the filtered and washed AC doped MWCNT cake was mixed with 15 mL solution of the carboxymethyl cellulose polymeric binder and ground in an agate mortar to obtain consistent conductive carbon paste. The carbon paste was stored overnight at room temperature for aging.
Cleaned polyester samples were cut into square and tape cast. The AC doped MWCNT suspension was printed onto the polyester fabric by using the facile doctor blade technique with the air drying (at 50 °C) method. The thickness of the layer was maintained by using a 3 M tape. The counter electrodes were dried at 70 °C for 30 minutes, pressed at 130 °C for 20 minutes in a hot press machine. Uncoated fabric edges were cut with scissors and 15 × 15 mm2 square pieces were prepared for the fabrication of the cell. The final features of the highly flexible textile fabric CE are shown in Fig. 1. For comparison, platinized FTO CEs were also prepared. 10 mM chloro platinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6) solution was prepared in isopropanol and drop cast on FTO glass followed by annealing at 400 °C for 20 minutes.

2.3 Preparation of the polymer gel electrolyte
In order to avoid the discharge of electrolyte through fabric weave, the polymer gel electrolyte was used. For its preparation 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.05 M iodine (I2), 0.1 M lithium perchlorate (LiI), 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate (GuNCS), 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) and 5 wt% of polyethylene oxide polymer were dissolved in acetonitrile solution. The thick polymer gel electrolyte was injected from the holed anode.
2.4 Cell fabrication
Photoanodes of SMT pattern were fabricated according to our previous research.31,32 First of all, holed FTO glass (15 × 15 mm2) was cleaned and treated with TiCl4. The 12 μm thick main layer (TiO2, P25) and scattering layer of titania nanotubes (TNT) were deposited and sintered in consecutive steps of 70, 325, 375, 450, and 500 °C for 30, 5, 5, 15, and 15 minutes, respectively. The annealed photoanodes were post treated with TiCl4 and immersed in 0.3 mM solution of N719 for 12 hours. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), DSSCs were assembled using the photoanode and carbon fabric composite CE, separated by the polymer gel electrolyte in sandwich type arrangement using two 60 μm thermoplastic hot-melt ionomer Surlyn. The polymeric gel electrolyte was introduced from a holed photoanode by vacuum filling and sealed with Surlyn and cover glass. The CE side of the cell was sealed by using a polymer film sheet.33 The DSSCs with an active area of 4 × 5 mm2, measured by using an electronic microscope (Camscope, ICS-305B, sometech Co.), were used for the photovoltaic test. For measuring the electrochemical characteristics of fabric CEs, identical dummy cells were assembled by two symmetrical carbon fabric CEs separated by the polymer gel electrolyte. Polymer sheet films were attached on backside to stabilize the fabric based cells. The symmetrical fabric based cells were sealed in a paraffin sheet pouch.
2.5 Characterization
The structural and surface morphology of carbon fabric composites were investigated by using a field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-6700F) at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. All carbon samples were coated with Pt for a better structure image. The morphological characteristics of AC doped MWCNT samples were tested by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The Surface area and pore size volume of different activated charcoal, MWCNTs and AC doped MWCNT hybrids were measured by the Perkin-Elmer and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method by using a Quantachrome Autosorb-6 Sorption System. Wide angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) was performed with a Rigaku Denki X-ray generator (Rigaku, D/MAX-2500), at 40 kV and 60 mA using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54181 Å) radiation. The structural characteristics of different composite structures were investigated using Raman spectrometry (Jasco NRS-3100) with excitation wavelengths of 532 nm green laser. Further, surface characterization was carried out by XPS (X-ray photo spectroscopy) using a multi Lab ESCA 2000 system VG from Thermo Scientific, USA. For XPS, mono-chromatized Al Kα radiation with an energy step size of 0.05 eV was used. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were also recorded using a Nicolett™ iS™ FT-IR spectrophotometer from Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (USA). All the fabric based samples were tested using the ATR Mode. The standard four point probe head system (RM 3000 resistivity test unit by Jandel engineering, Switzerland) was used to check the electrical conductivity of the fabric CE. The electrical conductivity against the flexibility of carbon fabric composites was tested using a custom-built two-probe device. The corrosion resistance of carbon coating (AC doped MWCNT) to electrolyte was recorded by using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer and a UV-1650 PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Co.) in the wave length range of 350–800 nm. The fabric composite samples were immersed in electrolyte solution for 2 days and the transmittance of the electrolyte was recorded before and after immersion. Less transmittance change of electrolyte is an indication of better corrosion resistance. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) test was tested for different carbon fabric composites and carried out by using a three-electrode system in an argon-purged electrolyte (0.01 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 prepared in acetonitrile solution) at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 with an ultimate electrochemical workstation (Bio Logic Co). The electrochemical properties of samples were measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) by using symmetrical cell configuration. The photovoltaic performance of DSSCs fabricated with different CEs was evaluated using a K101-Lab 20 source measuring unit (Mac Science Co). A solar simulator with a 160 W xenon arc lamp was used as the light source (spectral match; 0.75–1.25, non-uniformity of irradiance; ≤±2 percentage, temporal instability; ≤±2%). The light intensity was calibrated with a KIER-calibrated Si solar cell (Mc science Co). Photovoltaic parameters of the cells were measured under a masked frame.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structural characterization
Morphology of three types of activated charcoal is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). All ACs have an amorphous structure and a mesoporous surface. It can be seen that, pine tree based AC has a sharp board structure and defect rich structure. Whereas, coconut shell based AC has a polygonal structure and fewer defects, while coal type AC has a round shape structure with a low porous surface. Defect rich and porous morphology has the advantage of a fast tri-iodide reduction reaction and high diffusion of the concentrated polymer electrolyte.

Fig. 2 shows the FE-SEM images of uncoated fabric and carbon coated fabric composites. It can be seen that, the surface of polyester fabric is relatively clean and smooth. After AC doped MWCNT printing, the surface of the sample was fully covered with a carbon sheet. There are no obvious cracks or flaws on the sheet. Further the high magnification (FE-SEM) image shows a three dimensional fragmented amorphous carbon sheet decorated with the conductive MWCNT network. The digital photograph showed the homogenous printing on the textile substrate. The cross-sectional view of the AC doped MWCNT hybrid coated on polyester woven fabric was also observed. A thick mesoporous layer was observed on the woven pattern. The measured average thickness of the layer is about 16 μm, which is consistent with our previous studies.34 Furthermore, energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) confirms the significant presence of carbon with a high amount of oxygen in the carbon fabric composite. However, a small Si peak confirmed the presence of hydrophobic surface finish shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†).

(f) Cross-sectional FE-SEM image of the carbon fabric composite (digital image of the carbon fabric composite given in the inset). 
The AC doped MWCNT solutions were transferred onto the TEM grid for further characterization. From Fig. 3, it is observed that MWCNTs are well dispersed with the lipase enzyme without apparent aggregation. The TEM image also revealed the flat fragmented collapse of charcoal sheets decorated with the CNT tubular network. The presence of charcoal particles along with MWCNTs can promote electron transfer from defect rich carbon to the MWCNT walls, decreasing the surface work function of the MWCNT, thereby improving the reaction of I3− in the reduction mechanism.

To further characterize the identity and structure of different types of carbon fabric composites, WXRD, Raman, XPS and FT-IR tests were performed. Fig. 4a showed the WXRD spectrum of the carbon fabric composite prepared with different types (i.e. coal, coconut shell and pine tree) of charcoal particles. In case of composite C, a sharp diffraction peak centered at 25.8° can be indexed to (002) reflection of the graphitic carbon of the MWCNT.35 In addition, the XRD pattern also showed peak at 48.05° showing the presence of amorphous charcoal. The small diffraction peaks centered at 33.03° indexed to (111) refection of the silicon peak can be assigned to the contribution of hydrophobic surface finish on polyester fabric.36 A very small peak centered at 37.50° indicates the presence of cellulosic content of the CMC polymeric binder. The wide diffraction peak centered at 22.68° showed the presence of the polymeric chain of polyester fabric.

Raman spectra of carbon fabric composite synthesized with different charcoal are shown in Fig. 4b. A relatively higher D band for composite C (pine tree) was revealed due to the high defect produced by amorphous carbon. The intensity ratio of the crystalline G and defect rich D bands (ID/IG) in the Raman spectra is related to the sp2 carbon cluster sizes in the structure and is nearly proportional to the defect density. However, the ID/IG ratio (ID/IG = 1.22) indicates that composite C consists of partial mesoporous carbon with an ordered MWCNT structure, responsible for high conductivity and electrocatalytic activity of the composite C electrode. Further Raman spectra of the as-synthesized AC doped MWCNT are given in Fig. S5 (ESI†). A relatively higher D band for the AC doped MWCNT than that of MWCNT was revealed due to the structural distortion caused by doping of amorphous charcoal particles.
The XPS survey spectrum of the carbon fabric composite shows a pre-dominant carbon peak C1 at 284.4 eV, along with a high amount of oxygen O1 at 534.8 eV, possibly due to the incorporation of oxygen containing defect rich charcoal colloid. The survey XPS spectrum of CNT coated fabric and AC doped MWCNT coated fabric is shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Meanwhile, the C1s core-level spectrum (Fig. 4c) of the AC doped MWCNT could be fitted into four component peaks with binding energies of 284.4, 284.9, 287.0 and 294.0 eV, due to the sp2 hybridized carbon, sp3 hybridized carbon, C–O and π–π interactions, respectively. Moreover, the O1s spectrum shown in Fig. 4d could be fitted into two component peaks with binding energies of 531.8 and 533.9 eV, due to the contribution of C–O and CO, respectively. The oxygenated carbons were also detected in the XPS spectrum of the AC doped MWCNT. However, the intensities of these peaks readily increased from those of MWCNT, which indicates that amorphous carbon was successfully doped into the CNT tubular rings.
The type and amount of surface functional groups in coal, coconut shell and pine tree type activated charcoal are determined by FT-IR. Surface functional groups in activated charcoal have been identified and analyzed using charcoal dispersions in potassium bromide (KBr). Different oxygen functional groups on activated charcoal strongly influence the absorptive behavior, and catalytic reduction of charcoal. The FT-IR spectrum of different charcoal is shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The C–OH stretching mode and the bending mode can be found at 3445 and 1635, respectively. Therefore, we can reasonably assume that this bond is probably located in the carbon matrix.37 High absorbance spectra of the C–OH bond in pine tree charcoal indicate its absorptive properties.
Further the FTIR-ATR spectrum for polyester fabric and carbon fabric composite was also recorded. The FT-IR spectrum of carbon fabric shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†) indicates no change in the spectrum when compared with that of the bare polyester fabric. The modification in the spectra is directly related to the chemical reaction of the carbon layer with polyester fabric. FTIR-ATR investigation specified that no chemical reaction other than physical adhesion took place between carbon and polyester fabric.
3.2 Surface area and porosity
To investigate the surface area and porosity of the AC doped MWCNT hybrid, the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and the pore size was observed. The as-synthesized carbon layer exhibited typical N2 hysteresis of adsorption–desorption curves shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), indicating the characteristic of amorphous carbon. As compared to the AC free MWCNT, the AC doped MWCNT showed a higher amount of N2 absorption at high relative pressure, signifying the presence of high mesoporous carbon in the substrate. The AC doped MWCNT has a higher specific surface area of 500.0965 m2 g−1, with 1.102288 cm3 g−1 pore volume, whereas the AC free MWCNT has a low specific surface area of 337.1920 m2 g−1 with 1.030778 cm3 g−1 pore volume. The high specific surface area and pore volume structure will provide more accessibility to the I3− ions, and improved electrocatalytic activity.38 The surface area and pore volume of three types of activated charcoal (coal, coconut shell and pine tree) are given in Table 1. Pine tree type activated carbon has a high pore size volume with high surface area, responsible for its efficient performance.

3.3 Electrical conductivity and stability
The sheet resistance of AC doped MWCNT coated fabric measured by four point probe showed an excellent conductivity of 12 Ω sq.−1 when prepared with pine tree based charcoal. These results can be comparable to that of platinized FTO glass of 8 Ω sq.−1. The sheet resistance of different fabric composites is listed in Tables 2–4. The AC doped MWCNT was selected as the conducting electrocatalytic material on fabric, as it has significantly good catalytic reaction with iodide electrolytes and can easily be coated on fabrics at relatively low temperature. In order to test the conductivity of the textile CE against different bending positions, a custom-built two-probe device with slide clamps was built. A sample size of 1 × 3 cm was bent gradually in different positions and its electrical conductivity was measured as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The fabric electrode showed negligible difference in conductivity over different positions as shown in Fig. S11a (ESI†). The conductivity of the fabric electrode against bending cycles was also measured. The variation in the electrical resistance of the fabric was negligible over 10 bending cycles. After the bending test, no cracks were observed on the coated fabric Fig. S11b (ESI†).

In order to test the corrosion resistance of carbon composite fabrics to electrolyte, the samples were immersed in electrolyte solution for two days and the transmittance of electrolytes was noted. The transmittance of electrolytes did not change remarkably after the immersion of the coated fabrics (Fig. 5). The surface coating of the immersed samples was stable, no obvious cracking or imperfections were observed.

3.4 Electrocatalytic activity
The electrocatalytic activity of the CE is a significant parameter for improving the performance of DSSCs. Therefore, electrocatalytic activities of the different carbon fabric composites were initially studied by using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique. The AC doped MWCNT hybrid printed on polyester fabric is expected to produce high conductivity and electrocatalytic activity (ECA) towards the reduction of I3−. The CV curves of fabric CEs using a three-electrode system are presented in Fig. 6a. Two distinctive oxidation and reduction peaks were observed for different fabric composites. The negative pair was assigned to the reduction reaction (eqn (1)) and the positive one was assigned to the oxidation reaction (eqn (2)).39 I3− + 2e− → 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− → 2I3−(2)

The three important parameters which determine the catalytic activity of the CE are cathodic peak potential (ECP), cathodic current density (IPC), and the peak to peak separation (EPP) of potential difference. It indicates that a higher IPC, a more positive ECP and a lower EPP value demonstrates the greater electrocatalytic activity of the CE.40 It was observed that the variation of different carbon contents around the MWCNT caused variance in the electrocatalytic activity (ECA) of the fabric electrode. It can be seen that, the carbon fabric composite synthesized with composite C has larger oxidation and reduction current densities as compared to composite A, and composite B, respectively. These results were ascribed to the high surface area and pore volume of pine tree type charcoal, which affect its electrocatalytic activity.41 The cathodic peak potential (−2.43 V) and larger cathodic current density (−7.945 mA cm−2) indicate its superior electrical conductivity and electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction. Fig. 6b shows the CVs of carbon fabric electrodes prepared with different charcoal contents. It was interesting to find out that by increasing the charcoal content high electrocatalytic activity was observed. AC free CNT coated fabric possess low ECA with 1.95 mA cm−2, whereas the 0.8 wt% AC fabric electrode has a large cathodic current density with 4.09 mA cm−2. The profile and peak location of CV for the carbon fabric (0.8 wt%) electrode are similar to those of Pt coated FTO glass, demonstrating synchronized features of high catalytic activity and conductivity. Furthermore, by increasing the AC content from 1.6 wt% to 3.2 wt%, the CV profile is changed to pure activated carbon. Low ECA with only one reduction peak was observed in high charcoal content.42 It was confirmed that, our suggested carbon fabric composite (0.8 wt%) shows higher ECA than conventional platinized FTO glass showing an EPP of 0.70 V which is comparable with Pt catalyst with 0.24 V EPP indicating difference of ECA of fabric and the Pt CE (Fig. 6c).
3.5 Electrochemical properties
To understand the electrochemical catalytic activity of three kinds of carbon fabric CEs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out. In EIS characterization, electrochemical reaction rates of the redox couple (I−/I3−) were measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) with symmetrical cells as reported in the previous literature.43,44 The symmetrical cell configuration shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†), comprising two identical carbon fabric electrodes, was used to calculate the charge transfer reaction processes at the interface between the CE and polymer gel electrolyte. The sheet resistance (RS) and (RCT) parameters were obtained by fitting EIS plots using a Randles-type equivalent circuit in EC-lab software as shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). The typical Nyquist plots of symmetrical cells are shown in Fig. 7a. The plot shows a well-defined semicircle with one small semi-circle. The high frequency (around 100 kHz) intercept on the real axis represents the series resistance (RS) of the electrode. The first semicircle in the medium frequency region is related to the charge transfer resistance (RCT) and the corresponding constant phase element (CPE) of counter electrodes and electrolyte interface reactions, while the other small semicircle in the low frequency region demonstrates the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZW) of (I−/I3−) in the electrolyte. Since the Nernst diffusion impedance is negligible for our focus, we mainly place emphasis on the RS and RCT of CEs. The RS and RCT of different CEs together with other parameters are tabulated in Table 2.

The RS of three electrodes is negligibly varied, demonstrating good bonding strength of carbon sheet with textile fabric. According to the values obtained from the Nyquist plot, the RCT of the composite C (pine tree type) electrode was found to be 2.40 Ω, indicating a high electrochemical activity and conductivity compared to its counter parts. Composite A and composite B have comparatively high RCT of 6.50 and 3.94 Ω, respectively. This can be attributed to the slow ionic diffusion in the porous structure of the AC doped MWCNT hybrid synthesized with coal and coconut shell type charcoal. The above results confirm the significance of defect rich pine tree type charcoal in the catalytic reduction mechanism.
To further optimize the interfacial charge transfer process between the polymer gel electrolyte and composite C CEs, different composite C electrodes were fabricated by altering the charcoal content. The RCT of the composite C electrode decreases gradually with increasing charcoal content from 0 wt% to 0.8 wt%. This effect is due to the high porosity embedded in the MWCNT. In brief, the carbon electrode of 0.8 wt% AC highlights a reduction in RCT with 1.38 Ω (Fig. 7b). This proves that the synchronized effect of MWCNT with an appropriate dosage of activated charcoal can enhance the charge transfer mechanism of CEs when used with the gel electrolyte. A further increment in charcoal content, high RCT and low sheet to substrate adhesion was observed, which may be due to the mismatch composite ratio. The composite C fabricated with 0.8 wt% pine tree can be compared to platinized FTO glass (Fig. 7c). The RS of the carbon fabric is comparable with that of the Pt electrode due to the optimization of the doping process which enhances the conductivity of the fabric CE. The RCT value of Pt is 8.55 Ω, which is much higher as compared to that of the carbon fabric CE (1.38 Ω). This result further confirms that the carbon fabric composite has high conductivity and porous structure, which enhance the charge transfer kinetics and entrap a large amount of gel electrolyte for faster tri-iodide reduction. However, the faster charge transfer mechanism improved by carbon fabric also helps to sustain the maximum current attainable in DSSCs. Therefore, low RS and RCT of the composite C CE are responsible for the high FF and JSC of the corresponding DSSCs, listed in Tables 3 and 4, respectively.
3.6 Photovoltaic data
For feasible fabrication of the textile fabric CE, we choose the polymer gel electrolyte and FTO based photoanodes to fabricate DSSCs. The photo current–voltage (I–V) curves of DSSCs based on different carbon fabric CEs were measured under simulated AM 1.5 illuminations (1 sun, 100 mW cm−2). Fig. 8a shows the photocurrent density–voltage (I–V) curves of DSSCs based on composite A (coal), composite B (coconut shell), and composite C (pine tree) CEs, respectively. Detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2.
 Fig. 8  (a) Photovoltaic performances of DSSCs based on three types of carbon fabric composites CEs. (b) Effect of wt% of charcoal on photovoltaic performance. (c) Comparison of photovoltaic performance of DSSCs fabricated with Pt and carbon fabric CEs (inset shows the digital photograph of DSSCs fabricated with the carbon fabric CE). 
DSSCs based on the composite A CE exhibited poor performance with low values of FF and PCE of only 60.38% and 3.31%, respectively. The VOC and FF are largely affected by the electrocatalytic activity of the CE while low JSC obtained is due to the low conductivity of coal based composites. When using composite B, significant photovoltaic improvements were achieved, presenting a FF and PCE of 67.86% and 5.03%, respectively. Furthermore, when using the composite C CE, a noticeable improvement in FF and PCE was observed with 69.87% and 5.97%. Except for the FF, an increase in short-circuit current density (JSC) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) is also observed. This result confirms that, pine tree type charcoal materials are more electrocatalytically active than its counter parts and more suitable for CNT doping. Due to their highly porous and defect rich nature, composite C structures acquire the best photovoltaic parameters.
Carbon nanotubes are highly conductive, but less electrocatalytically active due to their low surface area and porosity.45,46 To speed up the kinetics of (I−/I3−) activated charcoal particles (AC) were doped with carbon nanotubes to integrate the porosity and defects. We tried to add 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, and 3.2 wt% of AC into MWCNT dispersion and obtained the synchronized effects of conductive CNT and defect rich AC. Fig. 8b presents the I–V curves of the DSSCs based on carbon fabric CEs containing different wt% of AC. It is shown in Table 3, with the addition of AC, the efficiency first increased and then decreased. The short current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) show the same change tendency. The DSSC using the AC doped MWCNT CE containing 0.8 wt% of AC reaches an efficiency of 7.29%, with a high FF of 79.03%. However, when we added over 0.8 wt% of AC, catalytic activities of the CEs started to decline due to the high number of defects produced by the AC, might lower the charge sites for iodide (I−) reduction, and thus reduces the FF and JSC of the cell. Low sheet adhesion was also observed in high charcoal dosage. For instance, the cell using the CE comprising 3.2 wt% of AC yields a low efficiency of 3.61%.

Fig. 8c presents the I–V curves of the DSSCs based on platinized FTO glass and carbon fabric CEs. The inset shows the fabricated DSSCs based on the fabric CE. The CE is composed of the carbon layer printed on woven fabric. The results are tabulated in Table 4. The cell fabricated with the conventional platinized FTO glass resulted in 7.16% efficiency; whereas, the cell prepared with the fabric CE reached 7.29% efficiency, outperforming the platinized FTO electrode. This result corresponds to among the highly efficient dye sensitized solar cells based on the fabric based CE. Specifically, both the open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) were found to increase for the fabric based DSSC. As per previous investigation of EIS analysis, the optimized induction of activated charcoal into the MWCNT displayed a defect rich and porous conductive structure with improved adhesion to the textile substrate leading to enhanced conductivity and electrochemical properties. This effect essentially directed to an increase of the electron transport at the interface of the AC doped MWCNT and polymer electrolyte and hence, high electrocatalytic activity, and reduction of the interfacial resistance (RCT) resulting in a high photovoltage (VOC), and FF.47 Low JSC of the carbon fabric composite was concealed with high VOC and FF values. However, the low current density (JSC) suggests the difference of light harvesting properties of different CEs.48
4. Conclusion
In summary, a highly efficient and flexible counter electrode was successfully developed by using a facile approach to fabricate an AC doped MWCNT hybrid printed on woven polyester fabric. Initially, three different types of charcoal (coal, coconut shell, and pine tree) were doped with the MWCNT and printed on polyester fabric. It has been proven that the pine tree composite (composite C) is compatible for the fabrication of a highly porous and defect rich hybrid structure and recommended for textile fabric coating. The optimization of doping with different dosages of charcoal in the MWCNT also improved the conductivity and electrocatalytic activity of the fabric CE. Finally, the efficiency of our suggested DSSCs using the textile fabric CE reached 7.29%, outperforming that of the platinized FTO glass. The whole design and fabrication is of low cost and is commercially feasible. Therefore, it can be estimated that this novel textile fabric CE will be promising for the roll to roll production of flexible textile structured solar cells.
