    , Accepted 30th March 2015First published on 1st April 2015AbstractThe interlayer inserted between the active layer and ITO has been demonstrated to be crucial for the performance of inverted polymer solar cells (i-PSCs). In this work, we find that ionic liquids (ILs) can significantly enhance the efficiency of i-PSCs. With the ZnO/IL interfacial layer, PTB7-Th:PC71BM i-PSCs can exhibit a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.15%, which is among the highest PCEs reported thus far for single-junction bulk heterojunction solar cells through the solution process. The IL layer and ZnO/IL combination layer with low work function, good optical transmittance, improved electron extraction and reduced resistance at the cathode interface have been demonstrated to be excellent and general interfacial layers for i-PSCs.
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention because of their promising flexibility, lightweight, ease of fabrication, and capability for large-scale and low-cost solution processes.1 In a typical photovoltaic device, an active layer is sandwiched between a metal electrode and indium-tin-oxide (ITO) electrode.2–4 PSCs with an inverted geometry have obtained over 10% power conversion efficiency (PCE)5,6 and have gained popularity in recent years as the inverted configuration uses an air-stable high work function metal, typically Ag or Au, as the anode, and ITO is used to collect electrons, offering an advantage of superior long-term stability.7 Moreover, in the inverted structures, charge collection can be enhanced due to the possible vertical phase separation with an acceptor-rich distribution at the bottom and a donor-rich distribution at the top.8,9
The inverted polymer solar cells (i-PSCs) fabricated with only a bare ITO cathode exhibit inferior performance because the high work function of ITO (∼4.7 eV) hinders the ohmic contact with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the fullerene acceptor (∼4.3 eV) in the active layer.10 To reduce the work function of ITO and improve electron collection for PCE enhancement, interlayers2,11–17 have been inserted between the active layer and ITO. Usually, metal oxides (ZnO, TiOx)18–21 are used as the electron-collecting interlayer. Polyelectrolytes, like PFN-Br, FPQ-Br and PEIE, are introduced on top of ZnO or TiOx to further improve the electron extraction and transport at the cathode.22–24
Ionic liquids (ILs) offer a unique suite of properties that make them important candidates for a number of energy related applications.25 ILs with entirely cation–anion combinations exhibit low volatility, and high electrochemical and thermal stability, as well as ionic conductivity, and create the possibility for designing new electrolytes for batteries, super-capacitors, actuators, dye sensitized solar cells and thermoelectrochemical cells.
In the literature, ILs have been used as a buffer layer between organic–inorganic heterojunctions to improve the hybrid device performance.26,27 In this work, ILs are employed as the cathode interfacial layer (CIL) to enhance the efficiency of i-PSCs for the first time. PTB7:PC71BM i-PSCs with the IL of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([BMIM]BF4) as the CIL show an improved PCE of 8.13%, enhanced short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) compared with control devices with a ZnO (7.51%) interfacial layer. With the ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 combined interfacial layer, the i-PSCs achieve a PCE of 8.65% (the champion PCE is 9.12%), which is 15.2% (champion 21.4%) enhancement from that of the control devices based on ZnO. Furthermore, i-PSCs of PTB7-Th:PC71BM based on the ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 interfacial layer give a champion PCE of 10.15% for single-junction solar cells, suggesting the good applicability of the [BMIM]BF4 interfacial layer. Moreover, another IL of 1-benzyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([BzMIM]Cl) show a similar improvement in the performance of i-PSCs, implying a variety of ILs have the potential to be suitable for CILs in i-PSCs.
The structure of the inverted PSCs is ITO/ZnO/[BMIM]BF4/PTB7 (or PTB7-Th):PC71BM/MoO3/Ag, as shown in Fig. 1a. The chemical structures of PTB7, PTB7-Th, [BMIM]BF4 and PC71BM are shown in Fig. S1.† To fabricate the devices, glass/ITO substrates were cleaned successively with acetone, isopropanol and ethanol under ultra-sonication for 15 min. ZnO thin films were obtained by spin-coating of the ZnO precursor (consisting of 0.1 M zinc acetate dehydrate and 0.1 M ethanolamine in 2-methoxyethanol)18,19,24 on the cleaned ITO substrates with a speed of 2000 rpm for 40 s, followed by annealing at 200 °C for 10 minutes in a nitrogen-filled glove box and continuous annealing in air at 200 °C for 1 h. [BMIM]BF4 dissolved in methanol (0.1 wt%) was spin-coated on the ZnO film at 5000 rpm for 1 min, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. [BMIM]BF4 (0.3 wt%) was spin-coated on ITO at 4000 rpm for 1 min, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. Then, the active layer PTB7:PC71BM (1:1.5 by weight, dissolved in o-dichlorobenzene/1,8-diiodoctane (97:3 vol%)) or PTB7-Th:PC71BM (1:1.5 by weight, dissolved in chlorobenzene/1,8-diiodoctane (97:3 vol%)) with a thickness of ca. 100 nm was spin-coated on top of the CIL-coated ITO substrate. MoO3 (5 nm) and Ag electrode (100 nm) were deposited on active layers by thermal evaporation at 2 × 10−4 Pa with a metal mask to form an active area of 0.064 cm2.

Fig. 1b shows the optical transmission spectra of ZnO, [BMIM]BF4 and ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 on the ITO glass substrates. The ZnO, [BMIM]BF4 and ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 layers on ITO are highly transparent, with >80% average transmittance in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 800 nm, allowing high photo flux to the active layer for generating more photocurrents.

Fig. 1c shows the topography images of ZnO and [BMIM]BF4 investigated by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). A thin ZnO film (∼10 nm)19 is deposited on ITO with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 1.2 nm. The IL layer of [BMIM]BF4 (with a high mountain of ∼20 nm) on ITO is rather rough with an RMS roughness of 15.9 nm. However, after spin-casting [BMIM]BF4 on top of ZnO, the ZnO film surface is covered by [BMIM]BF4 and the RMS roughness of ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 is 6.9 nm. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of ITO/ZnO, ITO/[BMIM]BF4, and ITO/ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 (Fig. S2†) clearly show F 1s and N 1s peaks, confirming that the IL layers are present on the ITO and ITO/ZnO surface. AFM topography images show the [BMIM]BF4 domain on the substrate, however, the energy dispersive X-ray spectra (EDX) (Fig. S3†) demonstrate that N, B and F elements appear on the whole substrate, which indicates the full coverage of [BMIM]BF4.
The work function of ZnO, [BMIM]BF4 and ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 films characterized by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM, Fig. 1d) shows that the deposition of the [BMIM]BF4 layer on ITO effectively increases the average surface potential of ITO from 66.95 mV to 397.21 mV. The average surface potential of ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 layers is 553.22 mV which is higher than 458.61 mV of the ZnO film.

Fig. 2a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the optimized inverted PTB7:PC71BM PSCs using ZnO or [BMIM]BF4 or ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 as the CIL under AM 1.5G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2. The device performance with the [BMIM]BF4 interfacial layer fabricated from different concentrations of [BMIM]BF4 solution is given in ESI (Fig. S4, detailed device parameters in Table S1†). The optimized [BMIM]BF4 interlayer was fabricated from 0.3 wt% in methanol at 4000 rpm on ITO, and 0.1 wt% in methanol at 5000 rpm on the ITO/ZnO surface. The device with the ZnO layer gives a PCE of 7.51% with a Jsc of 16.09 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.72 V and a FF of 0.648. When the [BMIM]BF4 alone is used as the CIL, the i-PSCs exhibit a Jsc of 16.70 mA cm¬2, a Voc of 0.72 V, a FF of 0.676 and PCE of 8.13%. Compared to ZnO-only devices, the improvement of [BMIM]BF4 only devices is mainly contributed by the Jsc and FF. Interestingly, with combined ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 layers as the CIL, the average PCE increases to 8.65% with a Jsc of 17.50 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.73 V and a FF of 0.677. The highest PCE of the PTB7:PC71BM i-PSCs with ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 layers is achieved at 9.12% (Fig. S5†). The device performance is obviously improved by using ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 combination layers as the CIL, and compared with the ZnO-based device, the improvement is mainly contributed by the Jsc and FF. The little enhancement of Voc can be interpreted by the fact that the Voc is largely determined by the LUMO and HOMO levels of the acceptor and donor, respectively.28,29

The absorption of PTB7:PC71BM on different CILs is studied (Fig. S6†). There are little absorption differences between PTB7:PC71BM on various CILs, indicating that the improvement of Jsc is not due to the enhancement of light absorption. Moreover, we have calculated the surface energy of the CILs on ITO30–32 (see ESI of Table S2†). The slight changes of the surface energy (ITO of 38.9 mN m−1vs. ITO/[BMIM]BF4 of 43.5 mN m−1, ZnO of 26.7 mN m−1vs. ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 of 27.2 mN m−1) indicate that the morphology of the PTB7:PC71BM film will not be affected by adding the [BMIM]BF4 layer.33 The investigated AFM topography and phase images of PTB7:PC71BM on ITO, [BMIM]BF4, ZnO and ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 (Fig. S7†) confirm that all the active layers have similar morphologies.
To further understand the role of [BMIM]BF4, the external quantum efficiency (EQE), contact resistance, and work function of CILs are studied. Fig. 2b shows that the EQE of devices with the ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 CIL is noticeably higher than that of devices with only ZnO, and also the EQE of devices with [BMIM]BF4 is higher than that of devices with ZnO, suggesting that the improvement of the device performance with [BMIM]BF4 is dominated by Jsc. The calculated Jsc values of the i-PSCs with ZnO, [BMIM]BF4 and ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 CILs by integrating the EQE spectra with the AM 1.5G reference spectrum are 15.10, 15.40 and 16.30 mA cm−2. All the calculated values are very close to the measured values (maximum error <8%).

Fig. 2c shows the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measured at the open-circuit voltage condition. The charge-transfer resistance is found to reduce dramatically for devices with ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 to those with ZnO as the CIL (Fig. S8 and Table S3†). This decrease in resistance further confirms that the ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 layer can favor electron transportation.27,34,35
The improvement of the device performance is largely attributed to the increase in FF. As a matter of fact, the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) play a significant part in FF. A decrease in Rs or/and an increase in Rsh is essential for achieving a high FF. According to Table S4,† the devices with ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 displayed a lower Rs (3.46 Ω cm2) and a higher Rsh (16.20 kΩ cm2) compared with the device based on ZnO (Rs = 10.28 Ω cm2 and Rsh = 4.53 kΩ cm2), which resulted in higher FF and PCE. In addition, the dark J–V curve (Fig. 2d) of ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 based i-PSCs clearly shows an increased current in the forward direction and reduced current in the reverse direction, giving a higher rectification ratio than that of devices based on ZnO. The FF increase can be further explained in terms of better rectification characteristics of the dark J–V curve.36 The lower leakage current of i-PSCs with ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 than that of devices with ZnO indicates that charge extraction is enhanced and a high photocurrent is expected.22,37
Furthermore, the charge-transporting abilities of ZnO and ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 as CILs are studied by electron-only device characterisation: ITO/ZnO or (ZnO/[BMIM]BF4)/PTB7:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The electron mobility of 2.47 × 10−4 and 4.91 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 is determined respectively for devices with ZnO and ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 as the CIL (Fig. S9†). Namely, the electron mobility of the device with combined ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 is approximately 2 times that of the device with ZnO only, indicating that the ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 film can promote the electron transport from the active layer to the ITO cathode. Thus the presence of [BMIM]BF4 between ZnO and the active layer promotes electron transport and extraction and consequently improves Jsc and FF.

Fig. 3a shows the energy level diagram of the inverted devices with CILs. The work function of the CILs is calculated from the surface potential (Fig. 1d) calibrated against highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG, with a work function of −4.60 eV, surface potential of 300.76 mV). Without the interfacial material, the work function of the bare ITO cathode is −4.83 eV; there is a large Schottky barrier at the ITO and PC71BM interface that hampers the efficient transport of electrons from the photoactive layer to the ITO cathode. The work function of ITO/ZnO (−4.44 eV) and ITO/[BMIM]BF4 (−4.50 eV) is still not sufficiently low compared with the LUMO of PC71BM (−4.3 eV) and the energy barrier for electron injection/transport is further decreased with decreasing work function of ITO/ZnO to −4.35 eV by the incorporation of [BMIM]BF4, which improved the electron transport in the ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 CIL. The reduced work function of ITO and ZnO by deposition of [BMIM]BF4 confirms that the modified interfacial layer can be used as the CIL.

Fig. 3b illustrates the changes of the CIL work function. The insertion of a charged IL layer brings spontaneous dipolar polarization at the interface and makes a vacuum level shift,26,27,38,39 leading to a change in the work function of ITO and ZnO. The BF4 anions prefer the ITO or ZnO interface, while cations composed of organic fragments spontaneously prefer the organic polymer interface.40 The dipole points away from ITO or ZnO, and the band edge of ITO or ZnO shifts close to the vacuum level of the active layer, decreasing the energy barrier at the interface between the active layer and the cathode, which will be beneficial for charge extraction. The combined results, such as higher Jsc, FF, and increased charge extraction at the cathode interface, lower resistance and reduced work function provide clear insight into the crucial role of the ZnO/IL interface in the performance enhancement of PTB7:PC71BM i-PSCs.
It is worth mentioning that this approach is also successfully applied in the promising material PTB7-Th. Fig. 4a shows that with ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 as the CIL, PTB7-Th:PC71BM i-PSCs achieve an average PCE of 9.56%, and the champion PCE is 10.15%. The calculated Jsc values of the i-PSCs with ZnO and ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 by integrating the EQE spectra (Fig. 4b) are 16.10 and 16.50 mA cm−2, respectively, which are close to the Jsc measured under illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 4c shows the dark J–V curve of PTB7-Th:PC71BM i-PSCs. The lower dark current and better rectification characteristics of i-PSCs with ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 than those of the device with ZnO indicate that charge extraction is enhanced and a high photocurrent is expected. Therefore, we suggest that it is a useful approach to improve the performance of inverted polymer solar cells.

In addition to [BMIM]BF4, [BzMIM]Cl is also used to verify the generality of ILs as CILs in the i-PSCs. [BzMIM]Cl also has high transmittance and a similar RMS roughness of ∼16 nm on ITO and decreases the work function of ITO from −4.83 eV to −4.31 eV (Fig. S10†). The J–V characteristics of the inverted BHJ PTB7:PC71BM devices with ZnO only, [BzMIM]Cl only and combination of ZnO/[BzMIM]Cl as the CIL under AM 1.5G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 are tested (Fig. S11†). The i-PSCs with [BzMIM]Cl as the interfacial layer show similar results to those obtained for devices with [BMIM]BF4 and the device performance is improved significantly by inserting the [BzMIM]Cl layer. The key device parameters are presented in Table 1. With the combination of ZnO/[BzMIM]Cl layers as CILs, the average PCE is increased to 8.49% (highest PCE of 8.81%), while devices based on ZnO and [BzMIM]Cl exhibit PCE of 7.51% and 8.40%, respectively.

Table 1 summarizes the device parameters of i-PSCs with various interfacial layers and active layers. For the active layer of PTB7:PC71BM, devices with ILs as CILs show improved Jsc, FF and PCE compared to devices based on ZnO. When ZnO/IL is used as the CIL, devices exhibit more exciting Jsc and FF, resulting in a higher PCE than that of the devices with ZnO. Using the promising active layer, PTB7-Th:PC71BM, the i-PSCs with ZnO/IL also show improved performance compared to that of the devices with ZnO only as the CIL. This further demonstrates that the ILs and ZnO/IL can not only be excellent but also general CILs for i-PSCs.
Conclusions
In conclusion, i-PSCs using ILs and combined ZnO/IL as new interfacial layers have been demonstrated. Modification of ITO and ZnO with the IL layer increases the device efficiency as a result of the reduction of the work function of the cathode by forming spontaneous dipolar polarization at the interface. PTB7:PC71BM i-PSCs with the ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 interfacial layer achieved an average PCE of 8.71% (champion PCE of 9.12%), which is 15.2% (champion 21.4%) increase from that of the control devices based on ZnO (7.51%). With the ZnO/[BMIM]BF4 interfacial layer, PTB7-Th:PC71BM i-PSCs give a champion PCE of 10.15% for single-junction BHJ solar cells. [BzMIM]Cl as the CIL showed a similar improvement of the device performance to the device based on [BMIM]BF4. The simultaneously improved Jsc, FF and PCE are attributed to the decreased interfacial energy barrier due to the decreased work function of the cathode. The IL layer with low work function, good optical transmittance, improved electron extraction and reduced resistance at the cathode interface has been demonstrated to be an excellent and general interfacial layer for i-PSCs.
