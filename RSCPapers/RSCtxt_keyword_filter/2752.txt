    , Accepted 11th December 2013First published on 12th December 2013AbstractWe report a novel method to prepare cuprous sulfide counter electrodes by ion exchange of ZnS. The ZnS film is deposited on a porous ITO electrode beforehand by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction, and converted into cuprous sulfide upon ion exchange for a short period of time. Using the cuprous sulfide counter electrodes, CdSe-sensitized solar cells exhibit a much higher photovoltaic performance as compared to their platinum counterpart, achieving a power conversion efficiency of 4.78%. Such an ion exchange process is promising to fabricate other sulfide counter electrodes, such as PbS, CoS, etc.
Introduction
Quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have attracted increasing attention for solar energy conversion.1–4 QDSCs are similar to their dye-sensitized counterpart – dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs)5–7 in terms of device structure and working principle. A major difference is the light absorber which is usually a narrow bandgap semiconductor in QDSCs, such as CdS,8,9 CdSe,10–12 PbS,8,9 CdTe,12 and PbSe,13 while molecular dyes in DSCs. These semiconductor sensitizers exhibit several intriguing properties, such as high molar extinction coefficient,14 size-dependent absorption due to quantum confinement effects,15 multiple exciton generation effects,16–18etc.
Initially, an iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox electrolyte19 was used in QDSCs, which led to serious dissolution of the semiconductor sensitizers. Therefore, a polysulfide electrolyte is subsequently employed in QDSCs due to its compatibility with the semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) and fast hole collection rate.20 However, the conventional platinum counter electrode (CE) fails to effectively catalyze the polysulfide electrolyte, as sulfur compounds tend to chemically adsorb onto the platinum surface and thus undermine the electrode performance through a poisoning effect.21 Previous work shows that some transition metal sulfides exhibit excellent catalytic activity for the polysulfide electrolyte and one best choice is Cu2S.22 Cu2S counter electrodes are generally prepared by immersing a brass foil in hydrochloric acid to dissolve the zinc component and then applying drops of polysulfide solution onto the treated brass foil to form a porous Cu2S electrode.3,10,23,24 Using such a counter electrode, a power conversion efficiency of above 5% has been reported in CdSe-sensitized solar cells.10 However, the polysulfide electrolyte continuously reacts with copper in the absence of a passive layer between the brass and the electrolyte, making the electrode chemically and mechanically unstable.25 As such, several alternative electrode configurations are exploited to replace the brass substrate, such as composites of reduced graphene oxide with Cu2S,25,26 carbon black with PbS,27 cobalt pyrite (CoS2) thin films,28 ITO porous film-supported metal sulfide,29 and so on. Nevertheless, these usually require multiple steps to fabricate the electrodes under rigorous conditions. For example, the composite electrode of reduced graphene oxide with Cu2S was prepared by synthesizing a suspension of graphene oxide and Cu nanoparticles, subsequently spin-coating the suspension onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, then reducing the graphene oxide under UV irradiation, and finally converting the Cu nanoparticles into Cu2S by immersing the electrode in polysulfide solution.25 In addition, the PbS-based counter electrode was produced by preparing PbS powders solvo-thermally, and then mixing the powders with carbon black through ball milling to form paste after drying in a vacuum oven, finally doctor-blading the paste onto FTO glass.27 Li et al. reported the fabrication of a counter electrode by depositing metal sulfides onto the pre-synthesized ITO porous films, while their cell performance was far from satisfactory.29
In this study, cuprous sulfide counter electrodes are produced using a facile ion exchange process. The ion exchange is based on the difference in solubility between two deposits, that is, ZnS and Cu2S. The solubility product constants (Ksp) of ZnS and Cu2S are around 10−25 and 10−48,30 respectively, which give rise to an equilibrium constant K of the ion exchange reaction from ZnS to Cu2S of ∼1023. This represents a large driving force for the conversion from ZnS to Cu2S, facilitating the formation of Cu2S films. Using this approach, cuprous sulfide counter electrodes are prepared by ion exchange of a ZnS film and then applied in CdSe-sensitized solar cells. The cell performance with cuprous sulfide counter electrodes is as good as that made with brass electrodes, but with much superior stability. Such an ion exchange process is promising to fabricate other similar sulfide counter electrodes, such as PbS, CoS, and so on.
Experimental
Preparation of TiO2 electrodes
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, Pilkington TEC-15, 15 Ω sq−1) glass was cleaned in 5% Decon 90 solution, distilled water, and ethanol by ultrasonication sequentially. A compact TiO2 layer was prepared onto the FTO glass by spray pyrolysis at 500 °C. Thereafter, a mesoporous TiO2 layer (Degussa, P25, ∼5 μm) and scattering layer (∼3 μm) were screen-printed onto the substrate. The electrode was subsequently heated at 125 °C for 5 min, 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min and finally 500 °C for 15 min. The resultant electrode was treated with 40 mM TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and then sintered at 500 °C for 30 min.
Preparation of CdSe-sensitized photoanodes
CdSe quantum dots were deposited onto the TiO2 electrodes by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method.3,10,11,26 Typically, the electrodes were first immersed in a 0.03 M cation precursor of cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO3)2·4H2O, Fluka, >99.0%) dissolved in absolute ethanol for 30 s, rinsed with absolute ethanol for 2 min, and dried for another 2 min. The electrodes were then dipped in a 0.03 M anion precursor (as detailed below) for 30 s, rinsed with absolute ethanol for 2 min, and dried for 2 min. This completed one cycle. The procedure was repeated for eight cycles so as to obtain an appropriate size of CdSe QDs. The anion precursor was prepared according to the method reported previously,11 where sodium borohydride (NaBH4, Sigma Aldrich, 98%) reacted with selenium dioxide (SeO2, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%) in absolute ethanol: SeO2 + 2NaBH4 + 6C2H5OH → Se2− + 2Na+ + 2B(OC2H5)3 + 5H2 + 2H2O. The SILAR deposition of CdSe QDs was carried out in an argon-filled glove box. After that, two cycles of ZnS passivation layer was coated onto the electrodes further by dipping in 0.1 M zinc acetate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, Sigma Aldrich, >99.5%) aqueous solution for 1 min, rising with deionized water for 1 min, dipping in 0.1 M sodium sulfide (Na2S·9H2O, Sigma Aldrich, >98%) aqueous solution for 1 min, and then rinsing with deionized water.
Preparation of cuprous sulfide counter electrodes
The paste of indium-tin oxide (ITO) nanoparticles (<100 nm, 30 wt% in isopropanol, Sigma Aldrich) was synthesized following the reported method used to make TiO2 paste.31 Thereafter, the same procedure was employed to screen-print and sinter the ITO paste on FTO glass, as detailed above. The thickness of the ITO electrodes was around 1.4 μm. ZnS was subsequently deposited onto the ITO electrodes using the same SILAR method for different cycles, referred to as ZnS(n) for depositing n cycles of ZnS. The electrodes were then immersed in a saturated copper(I) monochloride (CuCl, >99%, Sigma Aldrich, partially oxidized) acetonitrile solution for ion exchange, followed by rinsing with acetonitrile for 1 min to remove the excess ions. The ion exchange process was carried out in an argon-filled glove box. Hereafter, Cu2S(n) was used to denote the resulting electrode after ion exchange of the ZnS(n) electrode with the CuCl precursor. For comparison, platinized FTO counter electrodes were also prepared by thermal decomposition of hexachloroplatinic acid at 400 °C for 15 min.
Assembly of solar cells
Photovoltaic devices were assembled by separating the CdSe-sensitized TiO2 photoanodes and the counter electrodes with a hot-melt spacer (25 μm, Surlyn, DuPont) followed by heating at 110 °C for 1 min. The polysulfide electrolyte (1 M S, 1 M Na2S·9H2O, and 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution) was injected through a hole at the counter electrodes under a partial vacuum. The cells were finally sealed with a piece of hot-melt polymer and a microscope cover slip.
Characterization
The thickness of TiO2 and ITO electrodes was determined using an Alpha-Step IQ surface profiler (KLA-Tencor). Phase components were obtained by glancing angle X-ray diffraction (XRD, PANalytical Empyrean, Cu Kα radiation). The surface morphology and elemental compositions of the electrodes were characterized with a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, ZEISS, SUPRA 40) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental analysis system. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were collected by using an X-ray photoelectron spectrophotometer (Axis Ultra DLD) equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source (1486.69 eV). All the spectra were referenced to the binding energy of the C 1s peak (285.0 eV) arising from adventitious carbon. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured by using an ASAP2020 system (Micromeritics) at 77 K. Before the measurement, the ITO powders were degassed under vacuum at 200 °C for 12 h. The surface area was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation from adsorption data at P/P0 = 0.01–0.30. Absorbance results were obtained with a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Solidspec-3700) at room temperature.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out using symmetrical dummy cells of two identical counter electrodes. The frequency range of the EIS measurement was 105 to 0.1 Hz with a perturbation of 10 mV. The Tafel polarization curves were measured from −0.2 V to 0.2 V with a linear scan rate of 1 mV s−1. Current–voltage characteristics were measured with a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 from a solar simulator (450 W, Newport class A) calibrated with a silicon reference cell. The active area of the cells was 0.1199 cm2 defined by a mask. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained using a 300 W xenon lamp and a monochromator (Newport/Oriel) with a spectral resolution of ∼5 nm. The photostability test was carried out under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 for about 1 hour, with the photocurrent being recorded every 5 s.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the morphology of a bare ITO electrode, which has a porous structure and thus renders a high surface area of 23.0 m2 g−1 (see Fig. S1†). After SILAR deposition of ZnS, the particle size increases and a few clusters are visible on the surface, as revealed in Fig. 1b. Upon ion exchange of Cu+, the surface becomes more uniform, which is similar to the bare electrode but with relatively large particle size, as shown in Fig. 1c. In addition, the absorbance of the electrode increases after the ion exchange (see Fig. S2†). Therefore, coatings are formed on the porous ITO surface, yielding a high surface area, which is a requisite for high catalytic properties. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was used to analyze the composition of the ITO films after depositing with ZnS and subsequently undertaking ion exchange. The film in Fig. 1b contains 5.89% Zn, 5.99% S, 22.77% In, 1.87% Sn, and 63.48% O (atomic percentage, Fig. S3a†), exhibiting an atomic ratio of nearly 1:1 for Zn vs. S. This is in line with the component of ZnS. Upon ion exchange, 6.72% of copper emerges in the film while that of Zn drops from 5.89% to 1.99% (Fig. S3b†), indicating the occurrence of ion exchange from Zn to Cu. Assuming that the residual ZnS has an atomic ratio of 1:1 as in its original form, this yields a ratio of approximately 2:1 for Cu with respect to S (5.38% in Fig. 1c), suggesting the formation of Cu2S after ion exchange. It is natural to anticipate the formation of Cu2S given CuCl and Na2S were used as the Cu+ and S2− sources, respectively. The films were further examined by glancing angle X-ray diffraction, as shown in Fig. S4.† Only peaks of ITO29 and FTO32 are indexed while no zinc sulfide or copper sulfide can be detected. The absence of ZnS is consistent with our previous study where the ZnS prepared by the SILAR method has an amorphous nature,33 which may further lead to the formation of amorphous Cu2S.

To check the chemical states of the film and figure out the kinetics of the ion exchange process, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements were employed to examine the films of ZnS(10) after ion exchange for different durations. Fig. 2a shows that the binding energy of Zn2p3/2 locates at 1022.2 eV, consistent with Zn2+ in ZnS.34 The binding energy of Cu2p3/2 at 932.6 eV is assigned to Cu+,35,36 in line with the previous reports where the copper in sulfide minerals is usually in the form of monovalence.35,37–39 No chemical state of Cu2+ is present in view of the absence of the shake-up satellites.32 The XPS spectrum of S2p in the film before ion exchange (i.e., at 0 min) exhibits typical doublet characteristics with a 2:1 intensity ratio. The binding energy of S2p3/2 at 162.2 eV is attributed to S2− in ZnS.34 Accordingly, ZnS is the main constituent of the film deposited on the ITO electrode prior to ion exchange, in accordance with the EDX results. Upon ion exchange, the peak intensity of Zn2p (Fig. 2a) decreases, whereas that of Cu2p (Fig. 2b) increases gradually. In contrast, the peak profile of S2p broadens and loses the 2:1 ratio (Fig. 3c), indicating that the chemical states of sulfur become manifold in the presence of both Zn2+ and Cu+. With prolonged ion exchange, S2p remains nearly unchanged with similar peak profiles, implying that Zn2+ should be progressively replaced by Cu+ while sulfur continues to reside in the sample. The variation of S2p peaks could partly be a result of the presence of both S2− and (S2)− after ion exchange, the latter inducing the long tail of S2p spectra, which is absent in the spectrum with S2− only.37 Considering that the signal of the photoelectron originates from the very top surface of the film (about several nanometers), together with the EDX results that were discussed above, it is plausible that Cu2S is the major component after ion exchange while CuS appears at the electrode outmost surface. This can be rationalized as follows: upon ion exchange, formation of Cu2S would be dominant as both Cu+ and S2− ions are the major existing sources; in the film or just at the outmost film surface, some of the Cu2S may transform into CuS due to a much smaller solubility of the latter (1.36 × 10−15vs. 2.41 × 10−17 g per 100 g water at 20 °C for Cu2S vs. CuS) with the assistance of trace Cu2+ ions (from the partially oxidized CuCl salt) in the acetonitrile solution.

The ion exchange duration was 10 min for all the Cu2S electrodes. 
Based on the evolution of XPS spectra, the concentration changes of S, Cu and Zn during ion exchange are summarized in Fig. 2d. Obviously, as the ion exchange proceeds, the ZnS film was gradually converted into cuprous sulfide. For the ZnS(10) electrode, the content of ZnS drops from the initial ∼22% to ∼5% after 10 min. At each stage of ion exchange, the ratio of cation to anion was kept at around 1:1, in good agreement with the nominal components of ZnS and CuS at the top surface. Accordingly, the ion exchange duration was set for only 10 min in the subsequent study.
In order to determine the catalytic properties of the cuprous sulfide counter electrodes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and steady-state voltammetry measurements were carried out using symmetrical dummy cells. As the Nyquist plots show in Fig. 3a, the impedance of the Pt electrode is significantly larger than that of the Cu2S, indicating that the latter has much superior kinetics. Detailed impedance data are compiled in Fig. 3b by fitting the spectra in Fig. 3a with the inset equivalent circuit. It discloses that the charge transfer impedance at the Cu2S/electrolyte interface decreases initially with increasing SILAR cycle, and then keeps almost constant between 10 and 40 cycles, which thereafter increases abruptly. The initial drop is attributed to the progressive formation of cuprous sulfide on the surface of the ITO electrode, resulting in improved catalytic properties. The reaction rate becomes constant presumably when the ITO surface is completely covered by Cu2S through ion exchange of ZnS at more SILAR cycles. The impedance increment after 40 cycles originates from the complete filling of the mesopores of the ITO electrode with ZnS, giving rise to limited ion exchange inside the electrode. This makes only the outermost surface of the electrode active in catalyzing the reduction of polysulfide. The compact coating resulting from excessive deposition of ZnS onto the ITO electrode is clearly seen in Fig. 3c, in contrast to the porous counterpart as shown in Fig. 1c. Given the much smaller reaction resistance as compared to that of the platinum electrode (i.e., 2429 Ω), it is thus anticipated that better photovoltaic performance would be achieved with the cuprous sulfide counter electrodes in quantum dot-sensitized solar cells.
To further elucidate the charge transfer kinetics, Tafel plots for Pt and three best performed Cu2S electrodes were measured. As shown in Fig. 3d, the current density of the Cu2S electrodes is significantly higher than that of the Pt, exhibiting much better electrocatalytic activity towards polysulfide and corroborating the EIS measurements. The fitted apparent exchange current density j0 of Cu2S is in the range of 0.75–2 V, about three orders of magnitude higher than Pt counter electrodes.

Fig. 4a displays the photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the devices fabricated using different counter electrodes. With cuprous sulfide counter electrodes, the cell performance increases with the SILAR cycle up to 5 and declines thereafter. This is consistent with the EIS results shown in Fig. 3, where the reduced charge transfer resistance contributes to the enhanced performance from Cu2S(2) to Cu2S(5). Although the resistance is even lower for Cu2S(10) and that with more SILAR cycles, the residual ZnS under the Cu2S layer may behave as a barrier for charge transport and impair the cell performance. Therefore, the best cell was obtained with the Cu2S(5) counter electrode, yielding a VOC of 551 mV, JSC of 17.7 mA cm−2, fill factor of 49.1%, and η of 4.78%. Compared with the Pt electrodes, all of the photovoltaic characteristics are greatly improved, as summarized in Table 1.

Given the nearly saturated photocurrent of the Pt-based cell at low biases and the high limiting current density of the polysulfide electrolyte, it seems hard to simply ascribe the much higher JSC to the superior electrocatalytic properties of Cu2S. To elucidate the photocurrent differences, the IPCE spectra of these cells were recorded and are shown in Fig. 4b. Apparently, the high photocurrent of Cu2S cells as compared to Pt arises from the enhanced peak IPCE in the wavelength range of 400 nm to 650 nm, as well as the significant red shift of the spectra from 650 nm to 850 nm. As IPCE is generally determined by the yields of light harvesting, charge separation and collection, the enhanced peak IPCE here must be due to the improved performance of the photoanode. In addition, considering the bandgap of bulk CdSe is ∼1.7 eV,40 which corresponds to an absorption onset of around 730 nm, the red shift of the IPCE spectra very plausibly stems from the contribution of a different light absorbing material. Indeed, Cu2S has been detected on the photoanode by XPS, which is presumably from the re-deposition of dissolved Cu2Sx species on the photoanode by diffusion from the counter electrode. However, it is still unclear how the deposited Cu2S enhances harvesting of long wavelength photons since the Cu2S-sensitized TiO2 electrode itself performs very badly under similar conditions.
It is noteworthy that the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells based on Cu2S(5) is comparable with the reported results where the brass plate was used as the counter electrode, as exemplified in Table 1. However, the brass counter electrodes require a series of complicated procedures for fabrication and are mechanically unstable in light of continuous reaction of the polysulfide electrolyte with the brass. In contrast, the Cu2S counter electrode reported herein is produced with a facile ion exchange method, which employs Cu2S on ITO nanoparticles (without any reactive species) and FTO substrate (the same as the photoanode) and hence is anticipated to be more stable.

Fig. 5 displays the photocurrent evolution under a continuous illumination of simulated AM 1.5G at 100 mW cm−2 for about 1 h. Immediately after the shutter was opened (at 160 s), the cell produced a normalized photocurrent of 1 which reduced to ∼0.8 in about 20 min and increased slightly since then. The photocurrent dropped by ∼20% under one-hour illumination. The cell based on the Cu2S counter electrode is much more stable than that on the brass plate, which even cannot finish the test under the continuous illumination.

Notably, our cell performance is also much superior to that reported in a recent study where CuS counter electrodes were prepared by the direct SILAR method (4.78% vs. 1.47%) on the porous ITO film,29 possibly as a result of better catalytic properties of Cu2S and higher loading of the sulfide with the ion exchange method. It is anticipated that the performance of cuprous sulfide counter electrodes could be further improved by optimizing the thickness of the ITO electrode, the exchanging time of the thicker ZnS film and the post-treatment conditions, as well as by using purer CuICl salt. In addition, the ion exchange method can be feasibly applied to the synthesis of other electrocatalytic compounds such as PbS, CoS, etc.
Conclusions
Cuprous sulfide counter electrodes are produced by ion exchange of ZnS films deposited on porous ITO electrodes with Cu+-containing electrolyte solution. CdSe-sensitized solar cells with the cuprous sulfide counter electrodes exhibit much higher photovoltaic characteristics than those with the Pt counterpart, that is, 4.78% vs. 3.14% for power conversion efficiency. This is due to the increased photocatalytic properties with the cuprous sulfide counter electrodes, as well as enhanced light harvesting at long wavelength in the presence of cuprous sulphide, which is unfortunately not yet clear. The cell performance is also comparable to that with brass counter electrodes, but the mechanical stability is highly improved, making it promising and competent as an alternative approach to fabricate counter electrodes towards catalyzing the polysulfide electrolyte.
