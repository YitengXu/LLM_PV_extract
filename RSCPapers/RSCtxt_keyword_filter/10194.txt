In order to further improve the performance of spiro-OMeTAD based PSCs, a Lewis base can be introduced into the structure of spiro-OMeTAD wisely, which can keep the advantages of spiro-OMeTAD while incorporating the functionality of a Lewis base in passivating the surface of the perovskite. Therefore, spiro-type HTMs (spiro-CN-OMeTAD with a dicyano group and spiro-PS-OMeTAD with a thiocarbonyl group) were synthesized and confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and X-ray single-crystallographic diffraction. Spiro-CN-OMeTAD as an HTM is certified to have a suitable interfacial band alignment with the perovskite, good film quality and effective defect passivation, which facilitate the resulting device to achieve an efficiency of 19.90% with a high open-circuit voltage, low hysteresis, and improved stability. This study provides an alternative strategy for the molecular design of better HTMs in high-performance PSCs.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have aroused widespread attention due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties, with the resulting power conversion efficiency (PCE) soaring from 3.8% to 25.2% over the past ten years.1–4 Classical PSC structures can normally be classified into n–i–p and p–i–n configurations, which are invariably composed of a thick layer of perovskite sandwiched between an electron-transporting material (ETM) and a hole-transporting material (HTM) apart from the electrode at both ends. As the indispensable part of PSCs, HTMs play the role of transporting holes and blocking electrons, which have an immediate impact on the performance of PSCs.5,6 To date, a large number of organic molecular p-type semiconductors have emerged and have been applied in PSCs as the alternative HTM materials.7–22 Nevertheless, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) remains the most popular HTM in PSCs.23–25 The unique orthogonal molecular conformation of spiro-OMeTAD with a couple of rigid electron-donating π-conjugation systems help the titled molecule to form a thin and uniform film, albeit dopants and additives such as tert-butylpyridine, lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide salts, and cobalt complexes usually are needed to improve its hole mobility and conductivity.26–28 Since the introduction of dopants/additives also leads to problems such as increased hysteresis and instability,29 a series of novel dopant-free HTMs have been developed to substitute spiro-OMeTAD.30–38 However, they did not show such significant advantages that they can completely replace spiro-OMeTAD since the outstanding properties of spiro-OMeTAD outweigh its disadvantages.
Besides HTM, surface defects of the perovskite layer also affect the hysteresis and stability of devices.39 The density of trap states resulting from defects on the surface and at grain boundaries directly influences the free charge carrier diffusion since free charge carriers can be easily trapped at the defect sites under forward-bias working conditions and released under the short-circuit conditions unless the defects are refilled.40,41 This slow charge trapping and detrapping process is one of the reasons for the hysteresis phenomenon of the current density–voltage (J–V) curves.42 Furthermore, the existence of surface defects can weaken the stability of the devices due to the deprotonation of organic cations resulting from the charge accumulation at defect sites, which provides infiltration pathways for water vapor.43,44 Therefore, many strategies aiming at the passivation of surface defects have been developed, including Lewis acid/base,45–47 halide salts,48,49 quantum dots,50,51 hydrophobic materials,52,53etc. In particular, there were reports on integrating functional groups, such as sulfur atoms (e.g., thiophene units)54,55 and Lewis base groups (e.g., carbonyl and cyano substituents),56,57 which can passivate defects on the perovskite layer, into hole-transporting materials, by virtue of their interaction with Pb2+ cations in the perovskite.
Based on these considerations, if the Lewis base groups could be introduced into the structure of spiro-OMeTAD without changing the conformation of the molecule, the designed HTMs can preserve the advantages of spiro-OMeTAD while bringing the benefit of passivation effects. In this work, two spiro-type HTMs, spiro-CN-OMeTAD and spiro-PS-OMeTAD, were designed and synthesized via a much simpler route, and are abbreviated as spiro-CN and spiro-PS, respectively hereafter (Fig. 1). Single X-ray crystallographic diffraction (SCXRD) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show the orthogonal molecular structures of these new HTMs (as shown in Fig. S14b†). For spiro-CN, the dicyano group as a strong electron-withdrawing center is introduced into the core of the molecule, which can not only decrease the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level but also facilitate the passivation of the perovskite layer. Meanwhile, spiro-PS with the thiocarbonyl group can also passivate the defect in the perovskite via the binding interaction with undercoordinated Pb2+ cations. Finally, spiro-CN with the best surface passivation effect on the perovskite layer shows suitable film-forming ability, improved hole mobility, and more suitable HOMO interfacial band alignment with the perovskite. Thus, planar n–i–p structured PSCs based on spiro-CN showing a maximum efficiency of 19.90% with a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.16 V and low hysteresis are achieved successfully. Although spiro-PS displayed improved hole mobility, its performance as HTM is limited by the inferior film-forming ability, with an efficiency of 18.07%.

Results and discussion
The synthesis procedures for spiro-CN and spiro-PS are shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† The structure of the target HTMs is confirmed by 1H-NMR (Fig. S4 and S5†), 13C-NMR (Fig. S6 and S7†), and MALDI-TOF-MS spectroscopy (Fig. S9 and S10†). Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy revealed the disappearance of the stretching vibration of the carbonyl group at 1680 cm−1 in the reactant and the appearance of the stretching vibration of dicyano and thiocarbonyl groups in spiro-CN and spiro-PS at 2210 cm−1 and 1164 cm−1, respectively (Fig. S11†). Besides, we also successfully obtained single crystals of spiro-CN and spiro-PS and characterized them by SCXRD (Table S1†), which proves that both spiro-CN and spiro-PS have orthogonal molecular conformation like spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 2a and b). Similar to the case of spiro-OMeTAD,33 the two conjugated backbones of the new spiro-type HTMs are connected by one sp3 carbon atom, and the dihedral angles of spiro-CN and spiro-PS between the fluorene unit and the phenanthrene-type unit are found to be 84.46° and 82.66°, respectively, which are slightly smaller than those of spiro-OMeTAD (89.95°). In one unit cell, two independent molecules in the crystal lattice of spiro-PS are stacked tightly via two C–H–π noncovalent intermolecular short contacts (Fig. 2c), but there are no noncovalent intermolecular short contacts between two independent molecules of spiro-CN (Fig. 2d). In the crystal of spiro-PS, abundant noncovalent intermolecular short contacts, including C–H–π short contacts and O–H hydrogen bonds, can be found to induce tight packing (Fig. S12b†). Similarly, there were also some noncovalent intermolecular short contacts, including not only C–H–π short contacts and O–H hydrogen bonds but also C–N short contacts and N–H hydrogen bonds from the dicyano group, appearing in the crystal of spiro-CN (Fig. S12a†). These results indicate that the introduction of the dicyano group and thiocarbonyl group can increase intermolecular interactions that may improve the mobility of the films. Furthermore, through DFT calculation, we simulate the electron density distribution on two new HTMs via the electrostatic potential surface (ESP) and compare them with that of spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. S14a† for spiro-CN, spiro-PS and spiro-OMeTAD). A high electron density region significantly emerges on the electron-withdrawing groups, including the thiocarbonyl and dicyano groups, which can interact with under-coordinated Pb2+ cations to passivate the perovskite defects.

Besides, the red, blue, and grey colored atoms represent O, N, and sp3 C atom, respectively. Noncovalent intermolecular short contacts of spiro-CN (c) and spiro-PS (d) are marked with blue dash lines. 
The thermal stability of the two new HTMs was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). As shown in Fig. S15,† spiro-CN shows higher thermal stability than spiro-PS with 5% weight loss at 409 °C (decomposition temperature/Td). Spiro-PS shows two weight loss stages, with the first weight loss of around 2.49% at 348 °C, which may be attributed to the loss of sulfur atoms since the atomic ratio of sulfur atoms in the whole molecule is around 2.52%. Afterward, the second weight loss occurs at 416 °C, due to the decomposition of the backbone. Moreover, DSC measurements show that spiro-PS has a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 91 °C and a melting temperature (Tm) of around 181 °C, while spiro-CN has a higher Tg of 106 °C with two Tm peaks (202 °C and 243 °C), which may be ascribed to a mixture of low crystalline and high crystalline phases (Fig. S16†). According to the literature, although Tg of both new HTMs is slightly lower than that of spiro-OMeTAD,58 clear melting points indicate much increased intermolecular interactions.
The optical and electrochemical properties of the spiro-type HTMs were investigated using a spectrometer and potentiostat, respectively, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. In the UV-vis absorption spectra, both new HTMs exhibit two main characteristic absorption bands at around 306 nm and 380 nm, similar to spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 3a). The peaks at around 380 nm can be attributed to the π–π* electron transition of the conjugated backbone, and the extended electronic conjugation length rationalizes the slight red shift of spiro-CN compared to spiro-PS. The shoulder peaks at around 306 nm originated from the diphenylamine moieties.19 Moreover, extra low energy bands at around 584 nm are observed for spiro-CN and spiro-PS, which can be assigned to the n–π* transition induced by the lone pair of electrons from dicyano and thiocarbonyl groups, respectively. Based on the intersection of the absorption and emission spectra, the optical bandgap (Eg) of spiro-CN and spiro-PS are calculated to be 2.95 eV and 3.02 eV, respectively. Besides, the half-wave potential (E1/2) of the first reversible oxidation peak determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements show that the HOMO level of spiro-CN is around −5.16 eV, which is 90 meV and 70 meV lower than that of spiro-PS (−5.07 eV) and pristine spiro-OMeTAD (−5.09 eV), respectively (Fig. 3b). Encouragingly, spiro-CN shows a fairly deeper HOMO level, which is favorable for achieving a high VOC in PSCs for more suitable interfacial band alignment with the popular triple-cation perovskite (−5.65 eV).59 The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels can be subsequently calculated according to the HOMO and Eg data (Table 1). The LUMO value of spiro-CN (−2.21 eV) is slightly deeper than that of spiro-OMeTAD, while the LUMO value of spiro-PS shows no difference from that of spiro-OMeTAD (−2.05 eV). Both of these values are sufficiently higher than that of the perovskite (−4.05 eV), which could block the undesired electron transport from the perovskite to the Au counter electrode. Moreover, DFT calculations are used to estimate the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of spiro-type HTMs, as shown in Fig. S13.† It shows that the HOMO orbitals of the two new HTMs are delocalized primarily on half of the molecule without the electron-withdrawing groups, while the LUMO orbitals are localized throughout the other half of the core containing the groups. The EHOMO/ELUMO values are calculated to be −4.34/−2.39 and −4.41/2.41 eV for spiro-PS and spiro-CN, respectively, and show the same trend as the experimental values (Table 1 and S2†).

To prove the possible interactions between the new HTMs with the perovskite at the molecular level, the perovskite precursor solution is added successively into the HTM solutions. As shown in Fig. 3c and d, the emission bands of HTMs are weakened gradually with increasing concentration of the precursor solution. As for spiro-CN, the fluorescence quenching ratio (I/I0) can be calculated to be 64.34%. The blue shift of the emission from 467 nm to 460 nm could be attributed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) resulting from the interaction of the electron-rich unit (CN) in the spiro-CN molecule with the Pb2+ cation.60 The I/I0 of spiro-PS is 60.53% and 51.78% at 440 nm and 520 nm, respectively, accompanied by an insignificant blue shift. These results may indicate that spiro-CN can interact better with the chemical components in the perovskite than spiro-PS, which also is in agreement with the results of ESP calculations.
To check the film-forming ability of these new HTMs, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements are performed on their spin-coated films (Fig. S17†). Pinholes were randomly observed all over the films due to the corrosive effect of additives as previously reported.61–63 The root-mean-square roughness (RMS) of the spiro-CN film is 4.94 nm, which is lower than that of spiro-PS (RMS = 6.24 nm) but higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD (RMS = 3.24 nm), which can be linked to their different Tg values.15 These results show that the introduction of Lewis base groups into the molecules increases the intermolecular interactions and tend to form ordered molecular packing (crystallization), which influences the film formation of HTM molecules.16 The film morphology also has an impact on the hole transporting properties of HTMs, as shown in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements of their hole mobility (Fig. 4a and Table S4†). The measurement of the hole only devices indicates that spiro-PS (3.48 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and spiro-CN (1.04 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) both exhibit higher hole mobility values than spiro-OMeTAD (4.71 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), due to their improved molecular packing (crystallization) that facilitates charge-transport.

Besides the hole transporting properties, the hole extraction of the HTM at the interface with the perovskite also plays a crucial role in device performance. The interface quality and the hole extraction capability of the new HTMs were evaluated by steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. As shown in Fig. 4b, when spiro-CN and spiro-PS covered the perovskite layer, the PL of which is significantly quenched as in the case of referential spiro-OMeTAD, suggesting different levels of nonradiative recombination at the interface and hole extraction.64,65 By fitting the TRPL spectra with a bi-exponential model, the average lifetimes (τavg) of different films were estimated to be 57.31, 18.56, 14.96, and 16.27 ns for the bare perovskite, perovskite/spiro-CN, perovskite/spiro-PS, and perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD, respectively (Fig. 4c and Table S5†). Compared to the bare perovskite film, the average PL lifetimes of these HTM-covered perovskites were all significantly reduced, which indicate efficient hole extraction capability of the new HTMs. The relatively longer lifetime with spiro-CN indicates reduced interfacial recombination at the interface of the perovskite/spiro-CN.66–68 It was speculated that compared with spiro-OMeTAD, extra nitrile (CN) groups on the spiro-CN molecule could bind with undercoordinated Pb2+ cations to reduce the trap density of the perovskite film, and thus suppress the non-radiative recombination at the interface.69 The spiro-PS with the thiocarbonyl group should exhibit the same effect through the Pb–S interaction.54 However, due to the poor film morphology, a shorter lifetime is observed due to the increased non-radiative recombination. The result of TRPL is in agreement with that of the steady PL measurement, where spiro-CN showed a higher residual intensity than spiro-PS suggesting reduced non-radiative recombination for the perovskite/spiro-CN stacks.70
In order to investigate the photovoltaic performance of spiro-CN and spiro-PS as the HTM in PSCs, we fabricated the corresponding devices with a structure of FTO/SnO2/perovskite/HTM/Au. Fig. 4d displays the cross-sectional SEM image of a typical spiro-CN based device, where the thickness of the HTM is found to be 132 nm. The thicknesses of spiro-PS and spiro-OMeTAD (as reference) based HTMs are 103 nm and 138 nm, respectively (Fig. S18†). Fig. 5b shows the J–V curves of the best performing devices fabricated with each HTM, and their corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The spiro-CN based device exhibited the best PCE of 19.90% slightly better than that of spiro-OMeTAD (19.85%) in the reverse scanning (RS) direction, while spiro-PS displayed a lower PCE of 18.08%. Although spiro-PS shows the most significant mobility and defect passivation ability of the thiocarbonyl group, the unexpectedly terrible film quality leads to poor overall performance. The outstanding VOC of up to 1.16 V leads to the highest PCE with spiro-CN. This could be attributed to two reasons: the favorable interfacial band alignment with the perovskite, as depicted in Fig. 5a and the reduction of interfacial carrier recombination due to passivation of the perovskite film by the nitrile (CN) groups on the spiro-CN molecule.59 This phenomenon can also be proved by the much-decreased hysteresis of the spiro-CN based device, where a small hysteresis index (Hindex)16 of 1.51% is calculated based on a PCE of 19.60% for forward scan (FS), which is much smaller than those of spiro-PS (14.99%) and of spiro-OMeTAD (7.10%). Among around 15 devices were tested with each HTM, the average PCE of the devices with spiro-CN is 19.11%, which overweighs those with spiro-PS and spiro-OMeTAD (16.41% and 19.07%, respectively, Fig. 5c).The average VOC of the devices with spiro-CN is higher than those with spiro-PS and spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. 5d). The statistical short-circuit photocurrent (JSC) and fill factor (FF) are also shown in Fig. 5e and f. Additionally, we could see that spiro-PS showed a large average variance in device performance (poor reproducibility), resulting from its poor film-forming quality. In addition, we calculated the average Hindex, and the Hindex of the device with spiro-CN as the HTM (5.27) is lower than those with spiro-PS (8.06) and spiro-OMeTAD (15.97) as the HTM (Table S7†).

Identical incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra are measured for the optimal devices with different HTMs, as shown in Fig. 6a. The integrated current density is calculated to be 21.41 mA cm−2, 21.51 mA cm−2, and 21.46 mA cm−2 for the devices with spiro-CN, spiro-PS, and spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. This result agrees with the JSC value obtained from the experimental J–V measurement. Besides, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was applied to analyze the interfacial charge dynamics and combination behavior of devices with different HTMs. The Nyquist plots of the devices with different HTMs at a potential bias of 0.7 V under 10 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 6b and Fig. S19a.† The equivalent fitting circuit and related data are provided in Fig. S19b and Table S6.† There are two different semicircles located at different frequency ranges in the Nyquist plots. The high-frequency and low-frequency region correspond to the charge transfer/transport resistance (Rct) and recombination resistance (Rrec), respectively.71,72 From the high-frequency region (Fig. S15a†), we could see that the spiro-PS device displayed the smallest Rct, indicating the most efficient charge transfer, which is related to its higher HOMO level and mobility. Correspondingly, the spiro-CN device showed the largest Rct due its lower HOMO level, indicating relatively inferior charge transfer capability. However, in the high-frequency region (Fig. 6b), the device with spiro-CN showed the largest Rrec, which is in agreement with the effectively suppressed interfacial combination (vide supra). The smallest Rrec from the spiro-PS based device indicates more interfacial combinations ascribed to its poor film quality. This result is in agreement with the difference in the measured VOC of each HTM based device.

(d) Stability test under ambient conditions. 
To prove potential practical application of the new HTMs, we further explore the stability of the devices with spiro-CN and spiro-OMeTAD. Due to the poor reproducibility and PCE originating from the bad film-forming quality, we did not track the stability of devices with spiro-PS. The steady-state PCE at the maximum power point is measured (Fig. 6c). The Spiro-CN based device shows a reliable PCE of 19.5%, while the device with spiro-OMeTAD maintains a stabilized PCE of 19%. In order to test the long-term stability of the devices with spiro-CN and spiro-OMeTAD, we place the devices without encapsulation under ambient conditions at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 6d, the device based on spiro-CN retained 97% of its original PCE after 800 h. In contrast, the PCE of spiro-OMeTAD based devices decreased to 92% of the initial PCE. As the HTM layer with regular additives and dopant, spiro-CN based PSCs showed better long-term stability than those based on spiro-OMeTAD, which could be attributed to the presence of passivating functional groups on the molecular structure.
Conclusions
In summary, we focus on the synthesis of two new spiro-type HTMs (spiro-CN and spiro-PS) combining the advantages of a spiral structure with the ability to passivate the perovskite surface defects via the introduction of Lewis base groups. Among them, the synthesized spiro-CN was confirmed to have an orthogonal molecular conformation similar to spiro-OMeTAD by SCXRD. We proved that spiro-CN has a more suitable HOMO level and improved hole mobility. Spiro-CN with a dicyano group can passivate defects of the perovskite. Finally, the best PCE of 19.90% better than spiro-OMeTAD was achieved for spiro-CN based devices, with an outstanding VOC of 1.16 V and lower hysteresis. Moreover, spiro-CN based devices also showed improved operational stability and long-term stability. This work offers a novel insight into designing multi-functional HTMs for efficient and stable PSCs.
