    , Accepted 18th January 2021First published on 20th January 2021AbstractThe mixed halide perovskites have become famous worldwide due to their rapid development of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and unique photoelectric properties. Hysteresis is one of the unique characteristics of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in the current–voltage (IV) measurement, which sometimes causes the misjudgment of the true efficiency of the PSCs. In this work, the hysteresis relationship between the scanning way and efficiency in the IV measurement of PSCs is numerically studied through a time-dependent drift-diffusion model. For each PSC, there is an optimal scan rate in the IV measurement, which leads to the highest PCE. Furthermore, a neural network is constructed and trained in order to predict the PSC characteristic parameters through its hysteresis relationship. Through further experimental verification, the interface recombination and ionic migration information can be obtained from hysteresis. Overall, our work deepens the understanding of the complex PSC electrical performance caused by hysteresis, showing that hysteresis is a double-edged sword for the hybrid perovskite.
Introduction
Since Miyasaka and his co-workers first reported in 2009, hybrid organic−inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great attention due to their great development in the past decade.1–3 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs experienced a significant growth from 3.8% to 25.2% via their remarkable material properties, which include ambipolar conductivity, adjustable band gap, and defect tolerance, combined with a simple, low-cost processing method.4–7 These advantages have made the perovskite gradually become the most commercialized potential candidate in the new generation of solar cells.
Compared with traditional inorganic solar cells, hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites are composed of relatively soft ionic crystals, which have a profound impact on the optoelectronic and physicochemical properties.8 Ion migration is an interesting and unique phenomenon in PSCs, which originates from the ionic nature of perovskites. Researchers have carried out many studies on ion migration and believe that ion migration will cause defect generation, device instability and a series of problems. Although most influences of ion migration are negative, there are still some positive studies on ion mobility.9–13 Huang and his group found that perovskite exhibited strong resistance to ionizing radiation due to ion migration.14 Felix Lang showed that the self-healing originating in a perovskite derived from its ionic nature.10 It is true that ion migration can be a double-edged sword in the practical application of PSCs.15,16 While the disadvantages of ion migration have been sufficiently discussed, discussions on the utilization of ion migration are still limited and need more effort.
Ion migration will enhance many interesting PSC electrical performances, and current–voltage (I–V) hysteresis is one of them.17–20 Hysteresis was first reported by Snaith et al.,21 and can lead to a difference between the forward scan efficiency and backward scan efficiency, hampering the judgment of the maximum power point (MPP).22 Many factors can cause the PSCs to exhibit hysteresis in the I–V measurement, such as too fast IV scanning rate, too slow bulk ion diffusion speed or inappropriate interface properties.23–27 It is normally believed that hysteresis is harmful, and considerable interest has been recently directed toward hysteresis-free cells.28–30 However, every coin has two sides. As one of the phenomena caused by ion migration, the advantage of hysteresis is still worth considering.
Herein, by using a simulation calculation through a suitable semiconductor charge transport model, we reveal the hysteresis relationship between the PSCs IV performance and IV scan rate, and find that the PSCs efficiency strongly depends on the scanning speed. There is an optimal scan rate for each PSC, which leads to the highest PCE. Furthermore, the influence of different device parameters, such as the ion diffusion speed and bulk or interface carrier lifetime, on the hysteresis relationship between the PSCs performance and scan rate was studied. Our work deepens the understanding of the complex PSCs electrical performance caused by hysteresis, and shows a simple way to utilize the hysteresis to reflect the PSCs internal semiconductor property, which is beneficial for further PSCs performance enhancement in the future.
Numerical method and background
A time-dependent drift-diffusion (DD) model on the charge carrier transport and ion vacancy motion is a powerful tool for numerical simulation in PSCs. The DD model incorporated with ion migration was first used to explain PSCs I–V hysteresis by Reenen et al.31 Due to the Debye layers caused by the ionic charge in the interface between the perovskite and electron transport layer (ETL) (or hole transport layer (HTL)), the numerical solution of the appropriate partial differential equations (PDEs) is full of challenge. In order to overcome the numerical difficulties, Richardson and his group used the matching asymptotic analysis method to analyze the model,32 which is able to obtain simulated results similar to the experimental results. Based on previous research, Courtier et al. recently showed a high efficiency numerical method that can accurately solve the extremely stiff PDEs generated from these perovskite DD models.33 In addition, this method was extended to a three-layer model (ETL/perovskite/HTL) to reveal the origin of the PSCs I–V hysteresis.34 A similar model is used here, and will be described in detail later.
Here, we consider a perovskite solar cell composed of an electron transport layer, a perovskite absorber layer, and a hole transport layer (the structure schematic is shown in Fig. 1(a)). The ends of the ETL and HTL are connected by metal to form an ohmic contact. The relative equations describing the carrier diffusion and transport behavior are given below. In addition, these equations are coupled to Poisson's equation with the electrostatic potential (φ).

We assume that the photo-generation rate obeys the Beer–Lambert law, and the bulk recombination is followed by a trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) rate, as shown below: (5)
Similarly, in the ETL, bE < x < 0 electrons and the potential follows the equations: (6) (7)
In the HTL, b < x < b + bH holes and the potential follows the equations: (8) (9)
In consideration of the potential and displacement field continuity conditions and the carried discontinuity caused by the discontinuity of the electron affinity, we have eqn (10) in the interface between ETL and perovskite and eqn (11) in the interface between perovskite and HTL (10) (11)
The parameters kE and kH are written by: (12)
Besides, in the interface, the ion flux (Fp) is considered to be zero and the carriers will recombine. We have: (13)where Rl and Rr (the surface recombination rates) are assumed to be of SRH-type simplified as: (14)vpE and vnH refer to the corresponding carrier recombination velocity.
For the metal contacts at the ends of both transport layers, we have: (15)
The carrier densities are fixed on the corresponding effective doping density. The applied voltage Vap(t) can be directly applied on the devices (comprising the built-in voltage Vbi).
Finally, considering the perovskite net neutral at thermal equilibrium, we have: (16)
The parameters in the numerical simulation are shown in Table 1, and their values are chosen from the previous literature. Although we note that the parameter value of the PSCs can vary greatly with the composition and the preparation method of perovskite, the data we selected are as representative as possible. A more detailed derivation process of this DD model can be found in ref. 34.
Result

I–V hysteresis is a special phenomenon in PSCs, which makes the device exhibit different device performances under different scan rates. We used the DD model to simulate the I–V performance under different scan rates, as shown in Fig. 1(b). In this work, the IV scan always starts from 0 V to 1.2 V and then performs a backward scan. The detailed I–V parameters under different scan rates are shown in Table 2. At a low scan rate (0.01 v s−1), the device shows a relatively normal IV curve. The backward efficiency is around 21%, and the forward efficiency is around 19.5%. However, at a fast scan rate, both backward efficiency and forward efficiency are greatly reduced. The origins for this hysteresis phenomenon have been extensively studied. A widely accepted reason is briefly described as follows.34 Because of the ion migration, the built-in electric field will be offset by the ion electric field, initially. While applying a bias, the immigrated ion will be redistributed, which will cause the redistribution of the electric field in the PSCs. At low scan rates, the ion redistribution can reach quasi-equilibrium. However, at fast scan rates, the ion is not fast enough to respond to the electric field. The applied bias (opposite to the built-in electric field) is directly applied to the bulk perovskite, resulting in a low efficiency. The relationship between the scan rates and devices performance is shown in Fig. 1(c). With the decrease of the scan rate, both backward and forward efficiency increase. It is interesting that after exceeding a certain range, the reduction of the scan rate will reduce the backward efficiency, which means that there is an optimal scanning speed for the PSCs. Fig. 1(d) and (e) show that the variation of the efficiency is mainly contributed by the open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). The short circuit current densities (Jsc) are almost the same with different scan rates. The relationship between the efficiency and scan rate causes a problem with the judgment of the maximum power point. People usually choose the maximum power point at the optimal scan rates (corresponding to the maximum efficiency). However, in the steady-state output measurement, which is considered as a more efficiency judgment, the physical condition inside the PSCs is closer to the condition in the slowest scan rate (0.001 V s−1). From Fig. 1(c), it is found that there is around 1% difference between the maximum efficiency at a suitable scan rate and efficiency at the slowest scan rate. The relationship between the efficiency and scan rate may explain the efficiency difference between the I–V curve and steady-state output measurement, which is common in PSCs research studies.42–44

Although the hysteresis makes it challenging to determine the maximum power point, we believe it also has advantages for PSCs. Considering the unique relationship between the scan rate and efficiency, we think that the characteristic parameters of the devices, such as the carrier recombination rate or ion diffusion rate, can be obtained from the scan rate–efficiency relationship. Through the DD model, we simulated the I–V performance under different characteristic device parameters, and drew relationship graphs of the device performances and scan rates. Five major characteristic parameters were studied in this work. They are the ion diffusion coefficient (DI), electron lifetime in the perovskite (tn), hole lifetime in the perovskite (tp), hole recombination velocity at the ETL interface (vpE) and the electron recombination velocity at the HTL interface (vnH), as shown in Table 1. Fig. 2(a) shows the scan rate–efficiency relationship with different DI values (other devices performance parameters like Jsc or Voc are shown in Fig. S1(a)†). The variation range of DI is from 1 × 10−18 m s−2 to 1 × 10−16 m s−2. It is clear that the maximum efficiency point will vary with the scan rate, which implies that this unique scan rate–efficiency relationship is caused by the ion migration. The faster the ion diffusion, the faster the scan rate required to gain the maximum efficiency point. While the Jsc is almost the same, the Voc and FF will change at different scan rates. The effect of the scan rate on Voc and FF is somewhat different. The faster the ion diffusion, the faster the Voc reaches its maximum value. However, there is an optimal scanning speed for the maximum FF, just like the scan rate–efficiency relationship. The change rule of the efficiency and the fill factor are the same, which implies that FF is the main reason for the appearance of the optimal scanning speed.

Fig. 2(b) shows the efficiency and scan rate relationship with different tp values. The variation of tp hardly influences the trend of the device performances and scan rate, while the maximum efficiency point will be affected by tp. The maximum efficiency point will decrease from 21.5% to 20% with the decrease of tp from 3 × 10−6 s to 3 × 10−8 s. From Fig. S1(b),† it was found that FF is the major factor for the efficiency decrease. The variation of tn was also studied, as shown in Fig. S2.† However, the device efficiency hardly changes with tn, which implies that tn does not seem to be important to the device efficiency. This is easy to understand because in this simulation, the electron is the majority carrier whose variation will not have a significant impact on the efficiency, according to the semiconductor theory. Fig. 2(c) shows the efficiency and scan rate relationship with different vpE values, whose range varies from 1 m s−1 to 100 m s−1. Comparing the bulk carrier lifetime, it is the interface recombination velocity that has a more serious impact on the efficiency. With the decrease of vpE, the maximum power point in Fig. 2(c) will appear under a slower scanning speed, and its value will also decrease. As shown in Fig. S1(c),† the Voc and Jsc will significantly increase with decreasing vpE at a slow scan rate. Fig. 2(d) shows the relationship between the efficiency and scan rate at different vnH values. Although the variation of vnH seldom affects the maximum efficiency of the device, the Voc and FF will decrease and increase, respectively, with increasing vnH at a fast scan rate (shown in Fig. S1(d)†). In this work, vpE is faster than vnH, which is consistent with the actual perovskite devices performance.45,46 Thus, according to the barrel effect, the vpE (as the short board) will play a greater role in the device performance. Comparing Fig. 2(b) and (c), it is considered that the interface recombination is the important characteristic in the PSCs, which has been confirmed and emphasized many times by previous experimental research studies.47–49 Interface recombination has a greater impact on the PSCs efficiency, compared with bulk recombination, which is easy to understand according to the perovskite immigration model. Because of the ion migration, the built-in electric field or applied electric field will eventually be applied to the interface between the perovskite and carrier transport layer or perovskite grain boundary, which migrated ions cannot get through. Thus, the interface recombination situation is quite important to the PSCs performance.
The above discussions show that the relationship between the efficiency and scan rate can reflect the PSCs inner semiconductor characteristic to a certain extent. Here comes a question: Can we use the scan rate–efficiency relationship to obtain the device characteristic parameters? Unfortunately, the answer is no. The time interval among the IV tests has an impact on the device IV curve. Our experiment found that during the IV scan, the ion migration caused by the bias voltage cannot be recovered in a short time. Fig. S3 and Table S1† show two consecutive IV scan results of the same device at the same scan rate (the second scan is started immediately after the first scan). Their efficiencies are different, which implies that the PSC cannot recover to its original state in a short time after IV measurement. However, our theoretical research on the relationship between the efficiency and scan rate is based on the condition that the PSC original state is the same during each scan. In other words, due to the poor stability of the perovskite, PSCs cannot withstand so many IV scans, so the relationship between the efficiency and scan rate in the experiment cannot be obtained. In order to avoid this problem, it is necessary to find a new way to reflect the scan rate–efficiency relationship in one measurement, which needs us to deeply understand the origin of this relationship.
As discussed in other reports and the beginning of this work, the device performances at different scan rates depend on whether the ion can keep up the increase speed of the applied voltage and the corresponding electric field changes.34 According to the Occam's Razor rule, the simplest explanation is the best. In that case, studying the performance evolution of the PSCs under a fixed bias seems to be a better idea to reflect the ion immigration of the perovskite. A slower scan rate can be equivalent to a longer time spent under a steady bias voltage, and vice versa. According to previous work,15 under a steady bias voltage, the PSCs dark current will show a unique trend that changes with time, which is called IT curve in this work. Typical IT curves are shown in Fig. S4,† and can be found in our previous work. It is very interesting that, in the PSCs, the dark current cannot remain constant under a steady bias voltage with time. Under a low bias, the dark current will exponentially decay with time, which is usually considered to be caused by the ion current.50 However, under high bias, the dark current can show an abnormal increase before it decreases, which cannot be simply explained by the ion current only. Previous research studies have tried to explain the IT curves through the reversal of the electric field at the bulk and interface caused by the ion immigration under a high bias voltage.34 The redistribution of the electric field under a bias voltage can also be the origin of the hysteresis in the IV curve. Thus, it is considered that these unique IT curves can explain the relationship of the efficiency and scan rate.
Similar to the IV study, the IT curves were simulated under different devices characteristic parameters through the DD model, as shown in Fig. 3. The applied voltage bias is settled to 1.2 V and bias time is 200 s. Fig. 3(a) shows the IT curves with different DI values. The appearance time of the maximum dark current point will be earlier with the increase of DI, which means that the faster the ion immigrated, the earlier the maximum dark current appeared. Besides, the variation of DI will not influence the value of the maximum dark current. This result is similar to the effect of DI on the IV curves, implying that the interesting phenomena in the IT curves and IV curves under different scan rates have the same origin. The influence of tn on the IT curve is limited, as shown in Fig. S5.†Fig. 3(b) shows that tp can influence the final stable value of the IT curve, while the maximum dark current point will not change. The longer tp, the smaller the final stable values of the IT curve, which is easy to understand. It is known that a long carrier lifetime implies fewer defect states, leading to less defect current, which is the major part of the dark current. vpE has an extremely large influence on the IT curves, as shown in Fig. 3(c). Both value and appearance time of the IT peak will greatly increase with the increase of the vpE value, which demonstrates the important role of the interface in the performance of the PSCs once again. vnH has a little influence on the IT curves shown in Fig. 3(d). The initial growth curve and final stable value of the dark current will be slightly affected by vnH.

Fig. 3 shows that the IT measurement is simple and strongly relies on the perovskite inner semiconductor characteristic. However, it is still difficult to quantitatively obtain the PSCs recombination characteristics. This is because it is hard to use a physical function to describe the IT curves. Luckily, machine learning, which is very suitable for an unknown curve's nonlinear fitting problem, developed rapidly this year and has been successfully used in many life or research fields such as chess, gross national product, and biology study.51–54 Generalized Regression Neural Networks (GRNN), as an improved Radial basis function network, has strong nonlinear mapping capabilities and a flexible network structure, as well as a high fault tolerance and robustness, which is better than the traditional back propagation networks in terms of the approximation ability and learning speed.55,56 The structure schematic of GRNN is shown in Fig. S6.† Here, GRNN is used to learn the PSCs characteristic parameters effect on the IT curve. Our purpose is to get the PSCs characteristic parameters by introducing the IT curve into the trained GRNN. The flowchart of our machine learning is shown in Fig. S7.†
In this way, we trained the GRNN through 16000 IT curves simulated by the DD model with different PSCs characteristic parameters. The neural network was verified by 160 additional IT curves. The validation results are shown in Fig. 4. The x-axis is the device parameters we used to simulate the IT curves. The y-axis is the GRNN prediction parameters obtained by the simulated IT curve. A good linear relationship between the input value and prediction value means that the GRNN can successfully get the PSCs characteristic parameters from the IT curve. The prediction error rate distribution is also shown in Fig. S8.† The GRNN validation result and error rate of tn are shown in Fig. S9.†Fig. 4 shows that DI has the highest prediction accuracy with an average error rate of 0.41%. The average error rate of tp is 1.5%. For tn, it is 21.6%; for vpE, it is 5.9% and vnH is 18.5%. Comparing Fig. 3 and 4, it is clear that the greater the influence of the characteristic parameter on the IT curve, the better the effect of the GRNN prediction. The big prediction errors of tn and vnH are due to their minor impact on the IT curve. Different values of tn or vnH can lead to similar IT curves; thus, it is difficult to determine the accurate tn or vnH values from the IT curves. The high prediction accuracy of DI implies that the IT curve can precisely reflect the ion immigration of PSCs. In addition, the prediction accuracy of tn and vpE suggests that using the GRNN network to learn the IT curve is a good way to judge the recombination information of PSCs.

Furthermore, we measured the IT curve of the real PSCs in order to obtain the device characteristics through trained GRNN. The IV characteristics of four PSCs are shown in Fig. 5 and Table S2.† The structure of these four devices is FTO/TiO2/PCBA/perovskite/spiro/Au. The detailed preparation method is in the experimental part. The IT curves are shown in Fig. 5(b). The device characteristics parameters were obtained by taking the IT curves into the trained GRNN, as shown in Table 3. Here, tp and vnH are not considered due to a large prediction error. Only the parameters with a small prediction error are listed, such as DI, tp and vpE. According to the IT curve prediction, device B is considered to have the slowest ion diffusion coefficient and least interface recombination velocity among the four devices. This is due to the smallest peak in the IT curve of device B, which undoubtedly makes device B have the highest efficiency and the smallest hysteresis. On the contrary, device A has the largest IT peak, leading to a fastest interface recombination velocity predicted by GRNN, which explains the lowest efficiency of device A. The IT curves of device C and device D are almost the same; meanwhile, the GRNN estimates that they primarily have different hole lifetimes. It is natural that a bigger dark current means a bigger carrier recombination, leading to lower efficiency. Furthermore, thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS) is a powerful tool for quantifying the defect states in PSCs.57,58 In order to verify the prediction accuracy of the trained GRNN, an extended admittance was tested, which was once used in our previous works to decide the defect location.45 The bulk defect densities of these cells are listed in Table 3, which were calculated from the bulk-related capacitance. In the meantime, the interface defect densities were calculated from the interface-related capacitance information. For the detailed calculation methods of these defect states, please refer to the ESI† and our previous articles.45 (17) (18)

From the table, we can find that the defect distribution fit well with the results predicted by GRNN. That is device B, which has the slowest interface recombination velocity and has the smallest interface defect. Meanwhile, device A, which has the fastest interface recombination velocity, has the largest interface defect. In addition, the bulk defect of device C is bigger than that of device D, which is in line with the carrier life trend of these two devices. However, the learning sample is limited in one kind of PSCs, which means that the carrier mobility electron transfer layer or the component of perovskite should be unchanged in this research. If a different PSCs structure is used, the neural network should be retrained to ensure the accuracy of prediction. Although the machine learning method of the IT curve has some problems in this research, it shows the ability to separate the interface and bulk defects, and judge the hysteresis level.
Conclusion
In this work, we first used the DD model to reveal the relationship between the PSCs photoelectric conversion efficiency and scanning rate. Because of the ion immigration, each PSC has its most suitable scanning rate. Furthermore, we tried to explore the relationship between the intrinsic semiconductor characteristics of perovskite and the scan rate–efficiency figure. A GRNN is used to train the unique IT curve of perovskite in order to obtain the carrier's recombination information. In the conventional structure perovskite, it was found that the interface of ETL/perovskite and the ion migration velocity of perovskite affect the relationship of the efficiency and scanning rate. Our research helps to deepen the understanding of perovskite, and provides a simple but effective method for judging the performance of perovskite through the IT curve, which will provide convenience for further perovskite research in the future.
Experimental section
Materials
Titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) (97%) was from Alfa Aesar. 6,6-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBA) was synthesized according to an article (Y. Dong, Small, 2016, 12, 1098–1104). Lead iodide (PbI2) and lead bromide (PbBr2) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (99.9985%). Methylammonium iodide (MAI) and formamidinium iodide (FAI) were purchased from Shanghai Materwin New Materials Co., Ltd. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), chlorobenzene (CB), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were from Alfa Aesar. Spiro OMeTAD was from Luminescence Technology Corp. All of the chemicals were directly used without further purification. A laser-patterned FTO glass (Pilkington, thickness of 2.2 mm and sheet resistance of 15 Ω sq.−1) was sequentially cleaned with a mild detergent, distilled water, and ethanol in an ultrasonic bath. The substrate was treated with UV ozone for 15 min prior to use.
Device fabrication
The perovskite solar cells were fabricated on the transparent FTO substrate. First, 30 nm-thick, dense TiO2 layers were spin-coated on the FTO glass at 3000 rpm, and then calcined at 500 °C for 1 h. Second, the films were treated with TiCl4 aqueous solution (25 mM) at 70 °C for 10 min. After drying out, the films were sintered at 500 °C for 1 h. Third, 6,6-phenyl-C61-butyric acid (PCBA, 0.1 mg mL−1), which is a common interface-modified material nowadays, in CB was spin-coated on the top of the TiO2 compact film. For the sample, which is designed with interface defects, this step was omitted. Fourth, the perovskite film fabrication was deposited as follows in detail. Fifth, the 200 nm thick Spiro-OMeTAD layer was obtained by spin-coating at 3500 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 80 nm-thick Au electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation at an atmospheric pressure of 10−7 torr.
The perovskite mixture solution was prepared by dissolving different molar quantities of 1.47 M PbI2, 1.41 M FAI, 0.09 M PbBr2, 0.05 M MACl, and 0.09 M MABr in 1 mL solvent of DMF and DMSO at a volume ratio of 17:3. The solution was stirred for 6 h at room temperature. The perovskite films were fabricated by an antisolvent one-step spin coating method. The perovskite precursor solution was dropped onto the PCBA-modified TiO2 blocking-layer and spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 5000 rpm for 30 s. 120 μL of chlorobenzene was poured onto the spinning substrate at 15 s during the high-speed stage. The half-crystallization film was heated at 120 °C in an atmosphere for 15 min.
Characterization
The I–V characteristics were determined using a Keithley 2602 Source Meter under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) from a New Port Solar Simulator 69911. The light intensity was calibrated with a National Institute of Metrology-certified Si reference solar cell equipped with a KG3 color filter before the J–V measurements. A mask with a black aperture was used to cover the solar cells to constrict their active area to 0.1 cm2. The J–V curves were measured under a forward scan from 0.05 to 1.2 V and a reverse scan from 1.2 to 0.05 V using a scan rate of 30 mV s−1. The admittance spectra (AS) of the devices were measured by the Zahner IM6e electrochemical workstation in the dark in the frequency range from 0.1 to 106 Hz at zero bias.
