    , Accepted 4th February 2021First published on 6th February 2021AbstractThickness-sensitive fill factor (FF) is usually encountered by organic active layers with a thickness of several hundred nanometers, which significantly deteriorate the photovoltaic performance of thick-film polymer solar cells (PSCs). Here, paring of high-hole mobility (μh) polymer donor Si25 with benzotriazole-fused Y-series non-fullerene acceptor Y14 is proposed to overcome this challenge. Relative to the electron mobility (μe) of 8.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the Y14 pristine film, much higher μe values up to 3.79 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 were demonstrated using Si25:Y14 binary blend films, achieving μh/μe of 2.31–3.56. The Si25-induced closer packing of Y14 molecules was observed with the blend film. The high and fairly balanced charge transport-enabled PSCs with 320–600 nm thick active layers to show a low FF decay from 74.69% to 67.46%. Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 15.39% and 15.03% were achieved for 430 nm and 600 nm thick active layers, respectively. The device performances can supply a wide processing window with high efficiency. Delightedly, green solvent o-xylene cast active layers of 400 nm and 530 nm thickness exhibited PCEs of 14.43% and 14.25%, respectively. This study indicates that high μh polymers and benzotriazole-fused Y-series non-fullerene acceptors are promising candidates to overcome the thickness sensitivity of FF.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention as a promising energy conversion technology because of their good feasibility of low-cost processing, potential flexibility, and compatibility with high throughput roll-to-roll printing.1–5 For a long time, efficient BHJ active layers are usually composed of polymer donors and fullerene acceptors.3,4 Recent advances in small molecular non-fullerene acceptors6–8 and matching polymer donors have boosted power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs by over 17%, which surely outperforms that of fullerene-based PSCs.6–26 Currently, the most efficient non-fullerene-based PSCs usually display the best device performances with an active film layer of about 100 nm thickness.6–9 A thin active film layer of ∼100 nm can be precisely fabricated via small-area solution spin-coating; however, it is hardly prepared by large-area roll-to-roll printing at a high printing rate.27–30 Considering that there is an inevitable thickness variation on a large-scale production line, using thicker active layers of several hundred nanometers as the average thickness is beneficial for the pin-hole free printing and the expansion of the processing window to meet a higher printing rate.27–37 With an average thickness of 200 nm, a processing window of 200 ± 100 nm may be selected. Furthermore, an average thickness of 300 nm may be applied for a much larger processing window of 300 ± 200 nm if the device efficiency from 100 nm to 500 nm is sufficiently high. Therefore, highly efficient thick-film active layers are very important to achieve an ideal-processing window.
Developments of both new donors and new non-fullerene acceptors have provided a big change to achieve high efficiency active layers of ∼100 nm thickness; however, very few examples belong to the candidates that are suitable for the expansion of large and high efficiency processing window.8,9,21–26,38 In 2017, Zhao et al. reported that the paring of polymer PBDB-T-SF with non-fullerene IT-4F could show PCE of over 12% at a thickness range of 100–200 nm.39 The efficiency is attractive, however, such a high-efficiency thickness range is relatively narrow and only suitable for a very small processing window. A year later, a ternary active layer composed of small molecular donor BTR, non-fullerene NITI, and fullerene PC71BM demonstrated a maximum PCE of 13.63% at 300 nm thickness and more than 11% PCEs at 200–400 nm and more than 10% PCEs at 150–500 nm thicknesses. The processing window can be largely expanded with some sacrifice of efficiency.40
Recently, non-fullerene molecule Y6, with a twisted skeleton and a central fused-core containing benzothiadiazole, was reported as a milestone small molecular acceptor, which could be paired with numerous polymer donors with optimal efficiencies.8,21–23,41 Y6 and its derivatives such as BTP-4Cl, BTP-M, BP-4F have been employed to construct some binary and ternary active layers of ∼300 nm thicknesses with notable PCEs of more than 14%,16,17,36,37 representing the current best examples of highly efficient thick-film active layers. It should be noted that the polymer donors to pair with Y6 series acceptors for highly efficient thick-film active layers are limited to PM6, PM7, and D18, which belong to 2-dimensional benzodithiophene-based polymers. In general, along with an increase in the thickness, all the active layers exhibited decreased PCEs. This would limit the expansion of a large high-efficiency window. As shown in Fig. 1, the fill factor (FF) values of PSCs obviously decreased with the increase in the thickness, and it is hard to maintain FF over 70% for active layers of more than 350 nm thickness. Relatively, ternary active layers D18:Y6:PC61BM17 and PM6:BP-4F:MF1 (ref. 37) demonstrated better FF-thickness relationships. Moreover, at 300 nm thickness, there is no binary active layer that can show PCE ≥ 14% and FF ≥ 70%.
 Fig. 1  Summary of FF-thickness relationships of reported organic active layers with PCEs more than 14% for 300 nm thickness. 
We anticipate that insufficient and unbalanced charge transport in thick-film organic active layers would be the main factors for deteriorating the FF-thickness relationships of PSCs. Among the active layers of ∼300 nm thickness with notable PCEs of more than 14%, the D18:Y6:PC61BM ternary active layer of 300 nm displayed the highest hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) with μh of 3.03 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 1.44 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, as measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method.17 Using a polymer donor with higher μh than that of D18 to pair with an acceptor with higher μe than that of Y6:PC61BM would be an attractive approach.
We are interested in developing high μh polymer donors with strong interchain aggregation ability for efficient thick-film PSCs, and some of them such as 5,6-difluoro[2,1,3]benzothiadiazole (FBT) and quaterthiophene (4T)-based polymers FBT-Th4(1,4)33 and PFBT4T-C5Si-25% (Si25 in Fig. 2a)34 can show higher μh than that of D18. The challenge comes from the selection of a non-fullerene acceptor that can display higher μe than that of Y6:PC61BM, a pair based on powerful non-fullerene Y6 and a fullerene derivative. Otherwise, a high μh polymer donor paring with a low μe non-fullerene acceptor would result in an unbalanced charge transport and low FF in thick-film PSCs.42 Delightedly, we observed an interesting phenomenon in that the high μh polymer donor Si25 could induce non-fullerene acceptor IEICO-4F with 8 times higher μe in the Si25-based blend film as compared with the pristine film of the acceptor.30 It was interesting to find out whether a Y-series acceptor could induce a much higher μe in a Si25 based blend film, leading to an efficient active layer in a PSC device. Unfortunately, the trial with Y6 failed (Table S1†), and casting Si25:Y6 active layers with chlorobenzene (CB) and chloroform (CF) showed very low PCEs of 1.18% and 4.75%, respectively. This should be probably due to poor solubility matching of the two components as Si25 with high molecular weight hardly dissolves in CF and using CB as the solvent can afford efficient active layers,30 whereas CF is the best solvent for numerous Y6-based active layers.8,22,41 We further paid attention to Y14 (Fig. 2a) having a close skeleton to that of Y6 but containing a central benzotriazole-embedded fused core.43 Another alkyl side chain can be carried by benzotriazole, affording Y14 with good solubility in CB. The end mono-fluorination at the electron-withdrawing units enables Y14 with an upper-lying LUMO level of −4.01 eV (Fig. 2a) as compared to the end bi-fluorinations of Y6,41,43 which is beneficial for a more ideal open-circuit voltage (Voc). μe of 2.57–3.79 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 higher than that of Y6:PC61BM could be achieved for CB-casted Si25:Y14 binary active layers of 320–480 nm thickness, with fairly balanced charge transport (μh/μe = 2.31–3.56). The maximum efficiency of 15.39% was achieved with a 430 nm-thick binary active layer. A thicker active layer of 600 nm still afforded a PCE of 15.03%, which was unprecedented. Particularly, excellent FF values were demonstrated by thick active layers of a wide thickness range (Fig. 1). Non-halogen solvent o-xylene could be utilized to process Si25:Y6 active layers, showing the best PCE of 14.43% among the non-halogen solvent cast thick active layers (≥300 nm).44,45

2. Results and discussion
Polymer Si25 (ref. 34) and acceptor Y14 (ref. 43) (Fig. 2a) were synthesized according to previously reported procedures. Si25, a side-chain random copolymer of FBT-Th4(1,4) with 25% content of the siloxane-terminated side chain and 75% content of the 2-decyltetradecyl (DT) side chain, possesses a molecular weight (Mn) of 105.6 kg mol−1 and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.14. It should be noted that the alternating copolymer PFBT4T-C5Si-100% bearing only the siloxane-terminated side chain would exhibit very strong intermolecular aggregation to cast a smooth film, which is not suitable for optoelectronic device applications.34 As a balanced molecular design, Si25 could show a good film-forming ability, affording a high μh of 2.46 cm2 V−1 s−1 in field-effect transistors and a maximum PCE of 11.09% for a 420 nm-thick active layer of Si25:PC71BM in PSCs, all higher than the corresponding μh of 1.92 cm2 V−1 s−1 and PCE of 10.62% achieved by FBT-Th4(1,4) (carrying the DT side chain)-based devices.33,34 It is expected that Si25 would be a powerful polymer donor to pair with the Y14 molecular acceptor for efficient thick-film PSCs.
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of neat films of Si25 and Y14 as well as their blend film are illustrated in Fig. 2c. The neat film of Si25 with an optical band gap (Eg-opt) of 1.63 eV displays absorption covering the 400 to 760 nm range,34 while the neat film of Y14 with narrower Eg-opt shows a broader absorption ranging till 920 nm,43 affording the Si25:Y14 blend film with complementary absorption that can cover a wavelength range from 300 to 920 nm. Thus, the Si25:Y14 active layer would have a big potential to achieve a high Jsc in PSCs. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of Si25 and Y14 are depicted in Fig. 2c. The ΔEHOMO and ΔELUMO offsets are 0.24 and 0.32 eV, respectively, which may supply enough driving forces for charge separations between the donor and acceptor.
The SCLC μh and μe of Si25:Y14 blend films with different thicknesses were measured with hole-only and electron-only devices (Fig. S1†). μh values for the 320, 390, 430, and 480 nm thick blend films are 5.93 × 10−3, 7.32 × 10−3, 1.02 × 10−2, and 1.35 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Table 1), which significantly exceeded those of the PM6- or PM7- or D18-based binary and ternary blend films.16,17,36,37 Delightedly, high μe values of 2.57–3.79 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 could be achieved for the four blend films. The μe values are at least 3 times higher than 8.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 obtained for the pristine film of Y14 (Fig. S2†). A similar behavior for Si25-induced higher electron mobility of a non-fullerene acceptor in the blend film was also observed for Si25:IEICO-4F active layers in a previous report.30 The calculated μh/μe values of the Si25:Y14 blend films at different thicknesses are 2.31, 2.64, 3.04, and 3.56, showing fairly balanced carrier transport (Fig. 2d). It should be noted that the μe values of the Si25:Y14 binary blend films are obviously higher than 0.37–1.44 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 obtained for 110–300 nm thick D18:Y6:PC61BM ternary blend films comprising the non-fullerene:fullerene bi-acceptors.17

In order to investigate the photovoltaic performance of Si25:Y14 active layers, we fabricated resulting PSC devices with an inverted structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/PFN-Br/active layer/MoO3/Al, where the ZnO/PFN-Br bilayer was chosen as an electron selection layer to improve electron transport. For the optimized active layers, the D:A ratio was set at 1:1.2 in the absence of a solvent additive (Tables S2 and S3†), and dried at 110 °C for 10 min. As measured under the illumination of AM1.5G-simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2, the obtained current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSCs based on active layers with varied thicknesses from 210 to 600 nm are given in Fig. 3a, with the relevant photovoltaic parameters summarized in Table 2.

Si25:Y14 active layers with different thicknesses showed comparable Voc of about 0.78 V. For the active layer of 210 nm, the solar cell displayed a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.65 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 73.62%, giving a PCE of 12.97%. Increasing the active layer thickness to 320 nm could achieve a higher Jsc of 24.92 mA cm−2 and FF of 74.69%, leading to a better PCE of 14.55%. The notable FF and PCE demonstrate that high and balanced carrier transport for the binary Si25:Y14 blend can have a very positive effect on achieving a high-performance thick active layer. Interestingly, further increasing the active layer thicknesses to 390 and 430 nm could afford even higher PCEs of 14.79% and 15.39%, respectively, due to a further increased Jsc of up to 26.82 mA cm−2 and the almost-retained high FF of more than 73%. It should be pointed out that the 15.39% efficiency achieved with the 430 nm thick Si25:Y14 active layer is the highest for all reported binary and ternary organic active layers of 400 nm thickness.30,36,37,40,42,44,45 The average PCE for the 430 nm thick active layers is 15.03% (Table 2). After storage for over 30 days in N2, solar cells could maintain 92.5% of the initial efficiency (Fig. 3b). Thicker active layers of 480 and 600 nm also showed outstanding PCEs of 15.26% and 15.03%, respectively, due to high Jsc and decreased sensitivity of FF to the thickness. Increasing the thickness from 430 to 600 nm only results in a faint 0.36% efficiency drop, which is uncommon for the organic active layer. The high and balanced charge transport should be the crucial guarantees. Consequently, in a wide thickness range, Si25:Y14 active layers can show excellent PCEs, which is helpful for a high efficiency processing window, the yellow band, as shown in Fig. 3c. Even for very thick active layers with a thickness up to 780 nm, a good FF of 64.19% and PCE of 13.64% could be achieved (Fig. S3 and Table S4†).
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of devices with different thicknesses are shown in Fig. 3d, with integrated Jsc values listed in Table 2 for comparison. The spectral responses from 300 to 970 nm were demonstrated. The maximum EQE of 85% at 600 nm was achieved with the 600 nm thick active layer. All the current densities are very close to Jsc obtained from J–V curves, with discrepancies less than 6%.
The dependences of Voc and Jsc at various light intensities (Plight) can offer some information about the recombination process of PSCs. Here, we investigated the solar cells with the 430 nm thick active layer as an example. The relationship between Jsc and Plight can be expressed as Jsc ∝ PlightS, where the exponential factor S close to unity means negligible bimolecular recombination in the device. The dependence of Jsc on Plight is shown in Fig. S4a.† An S value of 0.951 indicated that recombination was faint. The Voc dependence on Plight could give a slope of 1.043kT/q (Fig. S4b†), which implied weak monomolecular recombination or trap-assisted recombination in the device. The results are consistent with a high FF of 73.38% of the device.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to investigate the morphology of Si25:Y14 blend films. Height images of Si25:Y14 active layers with a thickness of 210, 430, and 600 nm are shown in Fig. S5.† Root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values for the 210, 430, and 600 nm thick Si25:Y14 active layers are 0.618, 0.770, and 0.907 nm, respectively. The overall very low surface roughness values demonstrate a good film-forming property for the Si25:Y14 active layer and also imply good miscibility between Si25 and Y14. On the other hand, a thicker active layer gives larger RMS, which would accompany an enlarged phase separation. The AFM phase images of active layers shown in Fig. S6† are generally supporting this tendency. The phase separations should be at small levels because high Jsc values of 26.82 and 28.5 mA cm−2 can be achieved with ultra-thick 430 and 600 nm active layers, respectively.
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was measured to characterize the molecular ordering and orientation of the pristine and blend films. The 2D GIWAXS patterns for neat films of Si25 and Y14 as well as the Si25:Y14 blend film are shown in Fig. 4a, while the relevant line-cut profiles are depicted in Fig. 4b. The detailed crystallite parameters are summarized in Table S5.† The Si25 neat film displays obvious edge-on orientation. In the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, intense peaks at q vectors of 0.27, 0.54, and 0.80 Å−1 correspond to (100), (200), and (300) diffractions, respectively. In the in-plane (IP) direction, the (010) diffraction exists at q of 1.74 Å−1. For the Y14 neat film, an OOP (010) peak at q of 1.76 Å−1 corresponds to a π–π distance of 3.57 Å and an IP (100) peak at q of 0.40 Å−1 corresponds to a d-spacing of 15.71 Å were observed, indicating that Y14 prefers a face-on orientation. The calculated coherence lengths (CL) for the two peaks are 20.15 and 73.04 Å, respectively. In the blend film, the Si25 polymer shows weakened OOP (100) and (200) diffraction peaks at q of 0.27 and 0.54 Å−1, respectively, but in the IP direction, a new intense (100) peak at q of 0.25 Å−1 and a new weak (200) peak at q of 0.51 Å−1 emerge. The result indicates that the Si25 polymer chains prefer a bimodal crystalline structure in the blend film, which would help the hole transport along the vertical direction. The orientation transformation of Si25 in the blend film should be induced by Y14 acceptor molecules, reflecting that certain interaction existed between the Si25 donor and the Y14 non-fullerene acceptor. A similar behavior had been found for Si25:nonfullerene (Si25:IEICO-4F) blend films in a previous report.30 For orientations of Y14 in the blend film, OOP (010) and IP (100) peaks move to q of 1.77 and 0.42 Å−1, respectively, showing a decreased π–π distance of 3.55 Å and d-spacing of 14.96 Å. Thus, Y14 molecules in the blend film would establish closer packing and stronger interchain interactions. Moreover, enlarged CL values of 34.37 and 104.72 Å can be found for OOP (010) and IP (100) peaks, respectively. The results demonstrate the impact of a high mobility crystalline polymer donor on more ordering of acceptor molecules in the blend film. In general, crystalline parameters for Y14 in the blend film are more beneficial for electron transport compared with its neat film. As a result, high and relatively balanced charge transport can be achieved with thick Si25:Y14 blend films.

Although high efficiencies of PSCs have been demonstrated based on chlorinated solvents such as CB and CF, the potential toxicity may be a limitation for commercial applications. Exploring environment-friendly solvents is highly desired.44–47 Here, we tried to process Si25:Y14 active layers with non-halogen solvent o-xylene and no solvent additive was added. Delightedly, o-xylene cast 400 and 530 nm thick active layers could also be quite efficient, whose PCEs were 14.43% and 14.25%, respectively (Fig. 5a and Table S6†). Relative to the devices cast with CB as the solvent, the two o-xylene-fabricated solar cells could show comparable Voc and Jsc for the active layers of similar thickness but slightly lower FF values of 70.03% and 68.07%. It should be pointed out that currently there are limited reports on highly efficient thick-film active layers cast with non-halogen solvents and most of the non-halogen solvent-fabricated devices are based on thin active layers of ∼100 nm (Fig. 5b and Table S7†). The highest PCE for the so far reported non-halogen solvent-cast active layers with a thickness of more than 300 nm is only 11.7%.44 Therefore, the o-xylene-cast thick Si25:Y14 active layers with PCEs up to 14.43% are notable and represent a big efficiency jump for non-halogen solvent-cast efficient thick active layers with non-fullerene acceptors.

For comparison, the Y14 acceptor was also utilized to pair with another high hole mobility polymer FBT-Th4(1,4) bearing the DT side chain, which was synthesized in our previous report.33 Casting with CB, FBT-Th4(1,4):Y14 active layers with thicknesses of 310, 420, and 500 nm showed good PCEs of 13.28%, 14.05%, and 13.73%, respectively, with very limited FF change between 64.84% and 65.07% (Table S8†). Moreover, non-halogen solvent o-xylene could be utilized for processing of the 400 nm thick FBT-Th4(1,4):Y14 active layer, achieving a notable PCE of 13.81%. The results indicate that Y14 is an attractive non-fullerene acceptor to pair with high-hole mobility polymer donors in highly-efficient thick-film PSCs.
3. Conclusion
In summary, high-performance thick-film PSCs were achieved with a high μh polymer donor Si25 and a benzotriazole-fused Y-series non-fullerene acceptor Y14. Relative to μe of 8.17 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the Y14 pristine film, much higher μe values of 2.57–3.79 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 were observed for Si25:Y14 binary blend films, making high μh Si25-based active layers showing fairly balanced hole and electron transport (μh/μe of 2.31–3.56). The enhanced electron mobility corresponds to the closer packing of Y14 molecules in the blend film. For the impact on photovoltaic performances, Si25:Y14-based solar cells showed faint FF decay from 74.69% to 67.46% with the increase in the active layer thickness from 320 to 600 nm, enabling 430 and 600 nm thick active layers with PCEs of 15.39% and 15.03%, respectively. The device performances can supply a wide processing window with high efficiency. In addition, non-halogen solvent o-xylene-cast Si25:Y14 binary active layers of 400 and 530 nm thickness exhibited PCEs of 14.43% and 14.25%, respectively. Our results suggest that high μh polymers can match benzotriazole-fused Y-series non-fullerene acceptors towards highly efficient non-fullerene-based thick-film PSCs with thickness-insensitive FF.
