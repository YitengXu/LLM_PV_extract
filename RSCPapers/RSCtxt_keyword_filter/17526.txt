    , Accepted 18th December 2019First published on 19th December 2019AbstractAn organic–inorganic hybrid system of aniline stabilized bismuth iodide nanoparticles (ABI) was synthesized and investigated for its dielectric properties, AC-conductivity, polarization hysteresis and non-volatile memory performances. The X-ray diffraction result indicates the single phase crystalline nature of the nanoparticles and a microscopic image shows the homogeneous distribution of the bismuth iodide nanoparticles within the organic matrix. The material has exhibited a moderate dielectric performance via an interfacial polarization mechanism. The decrease in dielectric constant with frequency is correlated with the carrier concentration and diffusion potential, and the behaviour revealed that the halide ion mediated polaron migration controls the overall relaxation and conductivity properties of the material. Octahedral distortion of bismuth iodide, through halide ion migration, induced a hysteresis loop in polarization–electric field (P–E) characteristics. The device fabricated with the aniline stabilized bismuth iodide nanoparticles exhibited a space-charge limited current and trap assisted tunneling mechanism for the charge transport process. The non-volatile property reveals that the device has the ability to store binary information and has potential for memory applications.
1. Introduction
Research on organic–inorganic hybrid materials has attracted extensive interest due to their versatile applications in memory devices, charge storage, light emitting diodes, photo-detectors, solar cells, sensing, organic transformation reactions, proton-coupled electron transfer reactions and supercapacitors.1–9 Despite the recent developments, there is a strong demand for new types of hybrid materials with improved properties, environmental stability, unique functionalization and low cost synthesis. The dielectric study of organic–inorganic hybrid materials displays their capacitive behaviour with high charge–discharge ability, high dielectric constant and low dielectric loss and they have potential for flexible micro-electronic device applications.10 Recent studies on organic–inorganic materials have been conducted and the results show that these materials can be fabricated for a high dielectric capacitor device for various electronic applications.11 These materials are functionalized through a π-conjugation process that leads to the formation of polarons, quasi-particles, which contribute to the dielectric and transport properties.12 The optoelectronic properties of the hybrid organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites can be explained by the formation of polarons due to the defect tolerance properties of the material. Reports have been published13,14 on the direct time domain view of polaron formation in the single-crystal lead bromide perovskites (CH3NH3PbBr3 and CsPbBr3) predominantly due to the deformation of the PbBr3-frameworks, irrespective of the cation type. Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites and their derivatives exhibit versatile behaviour towards solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiency,15 resistive switching effect-artificial synapses16 and ferroelectric polarization properties.17 However, the existence of a ferroelectric or non-ferroelectric type of interaction in these materials has been under debate for several years. However, the current studies support that carrier migration via a defect mechanism through halide ion migration is responsible for the hysteresis type of behaviour. Recently, bismuth-based materials have received huge attention and emerged as a potential alternative over the lead based devices due to toxicity issues.18
Bismuth iodide based organic–inorganic hybrid materials have attracted interest because of their potential semiconducting character, rich structural diversity and interesting electronic and optical properties, for which the 6s2 lone pair of Bi3+ plays an important role.19,20 A phase-pure defect tolerant bismuth iodide thin film has been reported as a potential candidate for photovoltaic absorber applications.21 A report has also been published on the fabrication of lead-free bismuth based (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 perovskites with the power conversion efficiencies of 1.12% and 1.62% under 1 sun illumination.22
The above literature and some other recent studies18,23–26 indicate that work on the bismuth halide based materials has mostly focused on photonic and optoelectronic applications. Here, we report a new protocol for the preparation of aniline stabilized bismuth iodide nanoparticles using a wet chemical route via complexation and precipitation methods. The current communication will consider the dielectric charge storage properties, AC conductivity, electric field dependent polarization phenomena and non-volatile memory behaviour of the bismuth iodide nanoparticle based hybrid material.
2. Experimental details
2.1. Materials
All the reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Millipore water (Milli-Q system) was used wherever required.
2.2. Synthesis of aniline stabilized BiI3 nanoparticles
The fabrication of aniline stabilized BiI3 nanoparticles, an organic–inorganic hybrid system, was done using a wet chemical synthesis method. In a typical experiment, 0.48 g of bismuth nitrate pentahydrate with the concentration of 0.1 mol dm−3 was prepared by dissolving the bismuth salt in nitric acid, followed by addition of deionized water. Freshly prepared bismuth nitrate solution was added dropwise to a methanolic solution of aniline (1.0 mol dm−3) at room temperature. A light brown colour precipitate was formed immediately. To this precipitate, a freshly prepared aqueous solution of potassium iodide (0.1 M) was added slowly under stirring for a period of 30 min and the entire material was left for 6 h under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. The solid material was collected by filtration and dried under vacuum for 2 h.
2.3. Material characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the synthesized material was recorded using a Philips PANalytical X'pert diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation. The Raman spectrum was recorded using a Jobin-Yvon T64000 spectrometer with 514.5 nm excitation from an argon ion laser source. Microscopic studies were performed using a JEOL (JEM-2100) analytical Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) instrument. A temperature and frequency dependent dielectric study was performed using a HP 4284A LCR meter interfaced to a computer controlled EC1A environmental chamber. Electric field versus polarization loops were collected using a Sawyer–Tower circuit where the samples were subjected to a triangular wave with a frequency of 100 Hz. The current–voltage (IV) characteristics were measured using a Keithley-2401 source meter with the scan rate of 170 mV s−1 and a step voltage of 0.1 V.
3. Results and discussion
Structural characterization
The structure of the synthesized aniline stabilized bismuth iodide was studied by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique, see Fig. 1(a). The sharp and well defined diffraction peaks indicate the crystalline nature of the material. The synthesized material retained the stoichiometric ratio within the limit of X-ray measurement and no other secondary peaks were observed in the spectra. The experimentally observed pattern (red line) was indexed according to the rhombohedral crystal structure (JCPDS: 890307, blue bar) of the space group R (148), with the lattice constant values of a = b = 7.52 Å, and c = 20.70 Å. The rhombohedral structure of bismuth iodide consists of a two dimensional anisotropic layered structure of BiI6 octahedra. In the layered structure, the iodine anions are occupying the hexagonal closed packed lattice site, whereas the bismuth cations occupy 2/3 octahedral sites and the remaining 1/3 vacant cation sites between the layered structure.27,28Fig. 1(b) shows the TEM image of the organic–inorganic hybrid system, where the dark spots are the bismuth iodide nanoparticles, uniformly dispersed in the organic matrix. The average particle size of the synthesized bismuth iodide is within the range of 17–20 nm, as calculated from the histogram (inset, figure b). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, inset of Fig. 1(a), of the bismuth iodide material revealed several high intensity diffraction spots, which are the sum of the individual patterns from different nanoparticles.

(b) TEM image of the aniline stabilized bismuth iodide nanoparticles within the range of 15–19 nm dispersed throughout the matrix (inset: histogram for the particle size distribution). (c) Deconvoluted Raman spectra of the hybrid system. 
The local structure of the as-synthesized aniline stabilized bismuth iodide was studied by using the Raman spectroscopy technique. The spectra consist of several vibrational modes within the range from 20 to 450 cm−1, see Fig. 1(c). From the spectra, four (ν1, ν2, ν3 and ν6) strong intensity and two (ν4 and ν5) broad intensity Raman modes were extracted and their respective position values are listed in Table S1 (Supplementary information S1, ESI†). The mode (ν1) in the Raman shift region positioned at about 65 cm−1 is assigned to the Bi–I vibration mode, similar to other reported metal–iodide vibrational modes.29,30 The highest intensity mode (ν2) positioned at 93.5 cm−1 is associated with the poly-iodide ion contribution31,32 and for the present material, this corresponds to the symmetrical stretching vibration of tri-iodide ions.
The next strong mode ν3 positioned at 123.2 cm−1 is related to the varying strength of iodine–iodine interactions in the iodine molecule (I2) surrounding the tri-iodide (I3−) ions. The prominent intensity of these modes (ν2 and ν3) revealed that the majority of the iodine anions present in the material are in the form of [I–I⋯I3⋯I–I]n poly-iodide structures with bismuth cations, which favors the charge transfer or ion conductivity process.33 A diffuse mode ν4 positioned at 145.5 cm−1 is associated with the asymmetric or bond flexibility of the tri-iodide in the BiI6 octahedral network. Typically, no free iodine mode was observed; however, a diffuse type of mode (ν5) positioned at 245.6 cm−1 and an intense mode (ν6) positioned at 315.2 cm−1 are probably the overtone of longer poly-iodide/tri-iodide ions in the material.
Dielectric and AC-conductivity study
The temperature and frequency dependent dielectric constant (ε′) of the organic–inorganic hybrid system is shown in Fig. 2a, where at lower frequencies, higher values of dielectric constant were noticed. As the frequency increases, the dielectric constant values decrease gradually and become constant. For the present material, a higher dielectric constant value was achieved via an interfacial polarization mechanism due to the combined effect of inorganic and organic systems and their interfacial boundary. In general, two types of charge species, polaron/bipolaron and dipoles, are responsible for dielectric and conductivity properties.34–36 The polaron/bipolaron species are mobile whereas the dipoles are restricted in mobility and responsible for strong polarization. The decrease of dielectric loss (tanδ) value with frequency, see Fig. 2(b), inset, in the low frequency range, is responsible for the carrier migration mechanism. As the temperature increases, the dielectric constant (ε′) values are decreased, see Fig. 2(c). At 40 °C, the dielectric constant (ε′) value of ∼120 (at 0.5 kHz) was attained; with a further increase of temperature, the ε′ values are decreased. The decrease of the dielectric constant with temperature can be correlated to the formation of oxygen rich centers in the lattice of the bismuth iodide material upon replacing iodide ions (Supplementary information S1, Table S1 and Fig. S1, ESI†). The formation of bismuth oxy-iodide (BiOI) at higher temperatures (above 50 °C) creates a strongly localized oxygen rich centre in the lattice, which causes polarization loss of the material and results in a decrease of dielectric constant value with increasing temperature. The nature of the localized states and the dielectric relaxation of the material were further investigated by capacitance–voltage (CV) measurement under different temperature and frequency conditions. At room temperature, the variation of capacitance (C) with respect to frequency under different bias conditions (0–100 volts) is shown in Fig. 3(a). The change in capacitance becomes more pronounced at lower frequencies due to the polarization of surface states or trap charges between the valence and conduction bands. In the absence of voltage, the polarization process happens freely, whereas in the presence of voltage, the dielectric polarization aligned along the field direction and the reversal of polarization is inhibited, which results in a decrease of the capacitance value. The inverse capacitance (C−2) versus voltage (V) is plotted in Fig. 3(b) under different frequency conditions (Supplementary information S2, ESI†). The slope represents the negative types of charge carriers that dominate in the bismuth iodide based system, which is consistent with the previous reports of iodide based materials.37,38Fig. 3(c) and (d) exhibit the carrier concentration (Nd) and the diffusion potential (Vd) as a function of frequency, respectively. The value of carrier concentration and diffusion potential decreases with increasing frequency because under sufficient frequency conditions, the surface charge cannot follow the AC signal. With increasing frequency, a gradual increase of barrier potential (ϕb) indicates the low diffusion of charge carrier species and is represented graphically in Fig. 3(d), inset. In order to realize the nature of the mobility mechanism of the carriers, the AC conductivity (σac) of the material was measured at five different temperatures.

The AC conductivity as a function of frequency was plotted at different temperatures with a log–log scale, see Fig. 4(a). The figure indicates that the conductivity is directly proportional to frequency and inversely proportional to temperature. In the low frequency region, the graphs (for the temperatures of 30 and 40 °C) exhibit a frequency independent-like feature, which indicates the non-equilibrium occupancy of the trapped charges. With increasing frequency, the trapped charges are available for the conduction process. For each temperature, the AC conductivity follows a universal power law, σac = σdc + A(T)ωS, where σdc is the frequency independent DC part of the conductivity, A is the temperature dependent factor that determines the strength of polarizability and ‘s’ is the slope of the frequency dependent parameter, which varies from 0 to 1, and predicts the mechanisms, such as, correlated barrier hopping and non-overlapping small polaron tunneling. Our previous studies on bismuth oxide nanoparticles showed polaron formation and their mobility dependent hopping and tunneling mechanism.39 According to the correlated barrier hopping (CBH) and non-overlapping small polaron tunneling model, the ‘s’ value decreases and increases, respectively, with increasing temperature.40,41 The variation of ‘s’ with respect to temperature is shown in Fig. 4(a), inset, where the increasing trend suggests that the small polaron tunneling mechanism controls the transport behaviour.

(b) AC conductivity, in log-scale, with respect to the inverse of temperature (T−1) in two different regions (I and II), under different frequency conditions and (c) variation of activation energy (Ea) versus frequency and temperature for the regions (I) and (II). 

Fig. 4(b) shows the graphical representation of AC conductivity, log(σac), as a function of temperature (1/T) under different frequency conditions. The AC conductivity was characterized into two different segments, region (I) (≥50 °C) and region (II) (<50 °C) with different slopes. The activation energy (Ea) was extracted from the Arrhenius relationship of conductivity in two different regions, see Fig. 4(c). It is found that the Ea value decreases with increasing frequency (up to 100 kHz) and temperature (up to 60 °C) and above that, the Ea values increase with increasing frequency and temperature. It has been reported in the literature that the activation energy is related to the polarization mechanism of the material.42,43 The dipolar types of polarization require a larger activation energy for the relaxation process to occur.44 In the present material, the smaller value of Ea suggests that the relaxation phenomenon may originate from the polaron contribution, which generates due to the octahedral distortion of the bismuth iodide through halide ion migration.14 Two separate regions (I) and (II) of activation energy were exposed with different energy values, see Fig. 4(c). The low activation energy (∼20–80 meV), region (I), is associated with the enthalpy of defect mediated polaron formation, and the higher activation energy (∼80–195 meV), region (II), is associated with polaron migration inside the octahedra. The halide ion (I−) associated polaron migration happens along the equatorial to equatorial direction and gives a major contribution towards the transport property of the bismuth iodide system. The concept of Bi3+ ion migration can be discarded as the process needs a much higher activation energy.13,45
The change in the polaron transport (from long range to short range) with increasing frequency is manifested from the electric modulus spectra in terms of relaxation peak (find the related equations in the Supplementary information S3, ESI†). The modulus plots are used to distinguish between long range conduction processes and the contribution from the electrode polarization effect.46Fig. 5(a) and (b) exhibit the variation of real (M′) and imaginary (M′′) parts of the electric modulus, respectively, with frequency at different temperatures. Fig. 5(a) revealed that the value of M′ increases with increasing frequency and has almost zero value at lower frequency, which indicates the removal of the electrode polarization effect of the material. A relaxation peak was observed in the M′′ plot, see Fig. 5(b), towards the higher frequency side with a change in temperature, indicating the relaxation of polarons in the bismuth iodide system. The frequency below the peak-maxima represents the transition from long-range to short range mobility of the polarons with an increase in frequency. The activation energy and the electric modulus studies revealed that in the low frequency region, the electrical conductivity is associated with long-range tunneling, whereas, in the high frequency region, the conductivity is related to the short-range tunneling of the polarons.

Dielectric polarization and non-volatile electrical behaviour
Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain the hysteresis effect in halide based materials,47 where the halide ion migration mechanism is in excellent agreement with the theoretical and experimental findings.48 Numerical solutions indicate that the behavior of periodical potential and ion concentration oscillation strongly depend on frequency.49 The polarization versus electric field (P–E) hysteresis loop of aniline stabilized BiI3 nanoparticles measured at different applied voltages (±5, 10 and 15 kV), under a triangular waveform of frequency 100 Hz, is shown in Fig. 6(a). The feature of the polarization loop is more parabolic in shape. With increasing electric field, the polarization value and area of the hysteresis loop increase due to the growing contribution of ion migration during the polarization process. At 15 kV mm−1, maximum polarization (Pmax) and remnant polarization (Pr) values were achieved as 0.19 μC cm−2 and 0.08 μC cm−2, respectively, Fig. 6(b). The higher P–E hysteresis loop is due to the higher dielectric loss of the material, which is accompanied by the increase in remnant and maximum polarization of the material.

The DC current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the fabricated device (Au‖ABI‖Au) were measured at a scan rate of 170 mV s−1 under two different voltage sweep conditions (±1 and ±2 V), see Fig. 7(a). The pattern shows a hysteresis-type of behaviour and the area of the loop increases with increasing voltage amplitude. During the initial voltage sweep from 0 to 2 V, the I–V curve (red line) follows ohmic behaviour, IαVS, with a slope of (S) ∼ 1. During the reverse voltage sweep (from +2 to −2 V), the current–voltage graph exhibited the space-charge limited current (SCLC) mechanism, fitted with the ln(I) vs. ln(V) relation with a slope of (S) 2.30, followed by the trap assisted tunneling (TAT) mechanism, fitted with ln(I) vs. V−1, with a slope of −0.41. The charge transport property within the organic matrix is controlled by the trapping and detrapping of the charge carriers. The traps are the structural defects and/or the impurities (in the form of nanoparticles) that create additional energy states between the HOMO and LUMO bandgap of a polymer. These energy states trap the free charge carriers and stop them from playing any role in the charge transport process.50 In the trap assisted tunneling mechanism, the transport of charge carriers is via defects present in the dielectric (organic) matrix.51 In a similar fashion, during the forward voltage sweep (from −2 to +2 V), the current–voltage graph exhibited the trapped SCLC mechanism first and then the trap assisted tunneling mechanism. A similar mechanism has also been applied for the ±1 V window. Fig. 7(c) and (d) show the curve fitting for the space-charge limited current (SCLC) mechanism, with a slope of 2.30 and trap assisted tunneling (TAT) mechanism with a slope of −0.41, respectively.

A non-volatile study was also performed for the device. Non-volatile memory is a type of computer memory that has the capability to hold saved data even if the power is turned off. Non-volatile memories are used in a digital computing device for the storage of data. In this present experiment, the device was subjected to +2 V (−2 V) for a few seconds to induce the off-state (on-state). For the non-volatile study, a pulse train of 0.7 V amplitude with 0.1 s time period was applied every 60.0 s, see Fig. 7(b), inset, for 2 × 103 s. The study revealed that both the ON- and OFF-states do not fluctuate irrespective of an interrupted power supply, see Fig. 7(b), which indicates the non-volatile behaviour of the device based on the aniline stabilized bismuth iodide system.
4. Conclusion
In summary, the physical properties of bismuth iodide were studied under different temperature and frequency conditions. Thermally activated distorted octahedra induced polarons of bismuth iodide are responsible for a non-Debye type of relaxation mechanism for the hybrid system. The activation energy behaviour suggested that polaron migration took place along the equatorial to equatorial direction, which was responsible for a hysteresis pattern in dielectric polarization. The current–voltage behaviour indicates that the space-charge limited current and trap assisted tunneling mechanism is responsible for the charge transport property. The system exhibited a non-volatile property, which indicates that the device has the ability to store binary information and has potential for memory applications.
