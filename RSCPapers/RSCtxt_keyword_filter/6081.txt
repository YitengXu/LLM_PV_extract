    , Accepted 23rd January 2020First published on 6th February 2020AbstractA new covalent functionalization method is developed to produce a uniform multiwalled carbon nanotube/poly(3-hexylthiophene) (MWCNT–P3HT) nanocomposite via a thiol–ene click reaction between vinyl-terminated P3HT and thiol-functionalized MWCNTs. Microscopic and spectroscopic measurements confirm the covalent grafting of P3HT onto the surface of the MWCNTs. The covalently P3HT-functionalized MWCNTs show good dispersibility in hydrophobic solution. The intimate and permanent connection between the two components in the MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposite allowed the enhancement of charge transfer from P3HT to the MWCNTs. Relying on this unique feature, MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposite films for use in thermoelectric devices were fabricated, and the power generation characteristics were measured. Significantly, such MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposites showed more than twice the improved thermoelectric performance, as compared to directly mixed MWCNT/P3HT blends. This covalent grafting approach achieved via thiol–ene click chemistry offers a robust strategy for the synthesis of a variety of CNT-conductive polymer nanocomposites with an intimate contact interface for their potential application in energy conversion devices.
Introduction
Owing to their mechanical, optical, and electrical properties and large specific surface area, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted enormous attention as charming nanomaterials over the past few decades.1–4 CNTs have been widely used in various areas including energy storage, optoelectronics, sensors, and biological applications.5–11 Conjugated polymers (CPs) have gained considerable attention in recent years due to their wide applications in field-effect transistors, thermoelectric materials and photovoltaic devices.12–17 To improve the performance, much effort has been devoted to the integration of conjugated polymers into carbon nanotubes to form CNT/CP nanocomposites for the combination of the unique mechanical, optical, and electrical characteristics of the two components.18–20 Conventionally, the CNT–CP hybrid nanocomposites are produced by physically mixing CNTs with CPs or in situ polymerization.21–25 However, CNTs are likely to aggregate due to their large specific surface areas, which prevents the development of advantageous features from the combination of CNTs with CPs. Thus, non-covalent and covalent CNT functionalization strategies are proposed to overcome the CNT agglomeration issue. Non-covalent functionalization may prevent the aggregation of the CNTs by weak interactions (π–π stacking,26–28 and electrostatic interactions29,30) between CNTs and CPs. In addition, the non-covalent functionalization methods would not alter the chemical structure of the CNTs, which may maintain the intrinsic properties of the CNTs in the composite. However, the interfaces between CNTs and CPs may not be sufficiently intimate for efficient charge transfer in energy conversion applications.27 The point therefore is to form a good interfacial connection between CNTs and CPs, since the intimate interfacial contact between the two components could facilitate the transport of holes and electrons at the interface. Compared to the non-covalent approaches, covalent functionalization methods usually produce CNT–CP hybrid nanocomposites with higher structural stability and more favourable energy or electron transfer processes between the two components.31–33
Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is one of the most promising CPs in energy conversion due to its unique lamellar microstructure and solution processability.34–37 It can act as a good candidate at the interface with CNTs for use in organic solar cells38–40 and thermoelectrics.41–45 To evaluate the performance of thermoelectric materials, the dimensionless figure of merit ZT = S2σT/κ is usually adopted, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, σ is the electrical conductivity, κ is the thermal conductivity, and T is the absolute temperature. Since the S, σ and κ are interrelated with each other, it is difficult to simultaneously achieve optimal values for all of them within one material. Recently, much effort has been devoted to the nanocomposites based on conductive organic materials and carbon nanomaterials. Among them, the covalently tethered CNT–P3HT nanocomposite has been widely recognized as a promising candidate because it has potential to synergistically combine the superiorities of each component, such as a high S of P3HT and σ of CNTs, with low and easy processing for a flexible thermoelectric generator.46–49 To fabricate CNT–P3HT nanocomposites, covalent functionalization methods are usually carried out by chemically modifying CNTs with reactive groups (e.g., carboxylic acid groups), and then reacting with P3HT containing complementary reactive end groups (e.g., hydroxyl,50,51 aldehyde,52 and amino groups53,54). However, the esterification and amidation reactions are limited by low conversion efficiency and harsh reaction conditions. This prompted us to develop a more efficient strategy to prepare CNT–P3HT nanocomposites, in which the connection between the two components is intimate and stable. Thiol–ene chemistry as a new type of click chemistry has been greatly exploited in surface coating over other synthetic methods owing to its many advantages, such as mild reaction conditions, quantitative yields, and regioselectivity.55–59 CNTs have been functionalized with various polymers via thiol–ene click chemistry, in which either thiol-functionalized polymers were clicked onto CNTs or thiol-functionalized CNTs reacted with alkene-modified polymers.60–63 Moreover, it was found that the two components (i.e., CNTs and clicked polymers) in the hybrid composites established enhanced interfacial interaction through this covalent binding.63
Hence, we develop a facile and robust method to graft P3HT onto CNTs with strong covalent interfacial interactions between P3HT chains and CNT surfaces. In this work, alkene-modified P3HT was covalently tethered to the surface of thiol-functionalized MWCNTs through a thiol–ene click reaction between the thiol groups on the MWCNT surfaces and the vinyl groups on the ends of the P3HT chains. The morphology, structure, and optical properties of the MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposite with a P3HT coating layer on the MWCNT surface were studied by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The electrical properties and thermoelectric performance of the covalently connected MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposite film were investigated in a flexible thermoelectric generator, which showed excellent flexibility and improved Seebeck coefficient and power factor compared to that of physically mixed MWCNT/P3HT. The I–V characteristics and output voltage of the thermoelectric devices revealed that the formation of the intimate and permanent interface between P3HT and the MWCNTs was the key factor for the significant enhancement of the thermoelectric properties.
Experimental
Materials
Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs, diameter 20–40 nm, length 10–30 μm) were purchased from Nanjing XFNANO Materials TECH Co. Ltd. 2,5-Dibromo-3-hexyl-thiophene (98%), [1,3-bis(diphenyl phosphino) propane] dichloronickel(II) (99%), tert-butyl magnesium chloride (1.0 M solution in tetrahydrofuran), vinyl magnesium bromide (1.0 M solution in tetrahydrofuran), and 5-aminopentane-1-thiol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
Characterizations

1H NMR spectra were obtained using a Brucker Avance II 400 MHz spectrometer, in which CDCl3 was used as a solvent. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were collected on a JEM-1400 (JEOL) system operated at 100 kV. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed using silicon as the sample substrate on a Quanta FEG 250 (FEI) system. The molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of P3HT were measured by a Waters GPC system, equipped with a Waters 1515 HPLC pump and a Waters 2414 refractive index detector. THF was used as the eluent at 35 °C at 1.0 mL min−1 and polystyrene standards were used to calibrate the system. UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained using a Lambda 750 UV-vis spectrophotometer at room temperature. The photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a LS 55 PerkinElmer fluorescence spectrometer. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Dupont 651US system. The scan rate of TGA was 20 °C min−1 in an air atmosphere. The electrical properties and output performance of the thermoelectric generators were investigated using an electrochemical analyzer system (CHI 660E). A hot plate (WIGGENS, WH220-HT) was employed as a heat source to generate temperature difference (ΔT) between the two electrodes. A thermometer (FLUKE 52 II) and an infrared thermal imager (FOTRIC 226s) were applied to monitor the temperature.
Synthesis of thiol-functionalized mutil-walled carbon nanotubes (i.e., MWCNT–SH)
First, pristine MWCNTs (100 mg) were treated with a 60% HNO3 aqueous solution under reflux for 24 h, followed by washing with deionized water until the solution pH was neutral. The resulting black solid was dried overnight at 60 °C under vacuum. Subsequently, the acid-treated MWCNTs were dispersed into SOCl2 and reacted at 60 °C for 24 h. After the residual SOCl2 was evaporated by vacuum, 1 mL of 5-aminopentane-1-thiol (NH2(CH2)5SH) in 20 mL of dehydrated toluene was added to the reaction system and reacted at 100 °C for 24 h. The resultant thiol-functionalized MWCNT powder was dried under vacuum at 50 °C overnight.
Synthesis of vinyl-terminated P3HT
In a typical process, a three-necked flask was flushed with N2 and was charged with 2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene (1.63 g, 5 mmol) and anhydrous THF (10 mL). A 1.0 M solution of tert-butyl magnesium chloride (5 mL, 5 mmol) in THF was added via a syringe, and stirred for 2 h. Then the reaction mixture was added with anhydrous THF (25 mL) and Ni(dppp)Cl2 (45 mg, 0.082 mmol). The resulting solution was allowed to stir for 30 min at room temperature, producing intermediate P3HT, followed by addition of a 1.0 M solution of vinyl magnesium bromide (2 mL, 2 mmol) and kept stirring for another 30 min. The resulting mixture was diluted by THF and passed through a neutral alumina column to remove the metal salts. The final product (vinyl-terminated P3HT, i.e., P3HT–) was obtained by precipitation with cold methanol and then dried under vacuum at 50 °C overnight.
Synthesis of P3HT-grafted mutil-walled carbon nanotubes (i.e., MWCNT-g-P3HT) via thiol–ene click reaction
In a typical experiment, vinyl-terminated P3HT (80 mg) in THF (20 mL) was added to thiol-functionalized MWCNTs (60 mg) under stirring, followed by addition of 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile) (AIBN) (5 equiv.) under an Ar atmosphere. The reaction mixture was then refluxed overnight. The resulting dark suspension was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min, leading to a clear solution. Finally, the solution was concentrated by evaporation and then precipitated in methanol, followed by filtration. The solid product MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposite was dried at 40 °C under vacuum for 24 h.
Device fabrication
The fabrication procedure of the thermoelectric device is illustrated in Fig. 5a. To fabricate flexible thermoelectric generators, PET films with a thickness of about 100 micrometer were adopted as the substrate for the devices. Firstly, a layer of silver paste was coated onto the PET substrate as the bottom electrode. For the thermoelectric layer fabrication, 0.005 g MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposites was added to a mixed solution of isopropanol (IPA) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) (volume ratio of 1:1) under vigorous votexing. Then, 100 μL of the above mixture was deposited onto the bottom electrode and dried at 60 °C through a hot plate. After that, another layer of silver paste was coated onto the thermoelectric layer as the top electrode. With the above procedure, a flexible thermoelectric generator was obtained. For comparison, another thermoelectric device was fabricated with the same process, but using physically mixed MWCNT/P3HT.
Results and discussion
As depicted in Scheme 1, carboxylic acid group-functionalized MWCNTs (i.e., MWCNT–COOH) were prepared by acid oxidation with 60% HNO3, followed by chlorination with SOCl2 at 70 °C, yielding carbonyl chloride group-functionalized MWCNTs (i.e., MWCNT–COCl). Thiol-functionalized MWCNTs (i.e., MWCNT–SH) were subsequently obtained by reaction with 5-aminopentane-1-thiol in anhydrous toluene at 80 °C. The successful functionalization of thiol groups on the surface of the MWCNTs was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) (Fig. 1b). The characteristic absorption peak at 2710 cm−1 is associated with stretching vibration of S–H in thiol groups.64 Meanwhile, a quasi-living Grignard metathesis method (GRIM) was utilized to functionalize P3HT with a vinyl group at one chain end to form vinyl-terminated P3HT (i.e., P3HT–). The successful modification of a vinyl group at the end of P3HT was verified by the appearance of a vinyl signal (δ = 5.10 and 5.50 ppm) in the 1H NMR spectrum (Fig. S1, ESI†).65 The molecular weight of the prepared P3HT– was measured to be about 8.1 K with a narrow polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.24 using gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Thus, P3HT– was covalently grafted onto the surface of MWCNT-SH through a thiol–ene click reaction to form the P3HT-grafted MWCNT (i.e., MWCNT-g-P3HT) nanocomposite.

1H NMR measurement of the MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposite was conducted to confirm the covalent linkage of P3HT onto the surface of the MWCNTs (Fig. 1a). The characteristic broad peak located at δ = 6.96 ppm was assigned to protons of thiophene groups. The peaks at δ = 0.89, 1.33, 1.58, 2.50 and 2.78 ppm were from hexyl groups in P3HT. The disappearance of the vinyl signals was observed in the 1H NMR spectrum, indicating that the CC double bonds were completely consumed in the click reaction. FTIR measurements have also been used to probe the structure of the MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposites (Fig. 1b). The absorption peaks at 1584 and 1350 cm−1 in both the oxidized MWCNTs and MWCNT–SH are attributed to the CO and C–O–H vibrations of the carboxylic groups, respectively. After thiol–ene clicking, the disappearance of the S–H absorption peak at 2710 cm−1 indicates that the thiol groups on the MWCNT surfaces were totally consumed in the reaction. The weak absorption peak at 3055 cm−1 is attributed to the stretching mode of C–H on the thiophene ring and the strong absorption peaks at 2960, 2921, 2851, and 802 cm−1 are assigned to the C–H stretch vibration of the hexyl groups in the P3HT chains. Moreover, the peaks located at 1011 and 1091 cm−1 correspond to the stretching mode of C–S–C bonds formed in the click reaction, verifying the successful grafting of P3HT chains onto the MWCNT surface.
TEM and SEM measurements were conducted to further characterize the structure and morphology of the MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposites. Fig. 2a and b show TEM images for a single pristine MWCNT and an individual MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposite, respectively. Obviously, the MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposite reveals a rougher surface and larger nanotube diameter, compared to those of the pristine MWCNT. The rough surface and increased diameter are owing to the introduction of grafted P3HT chains on the MWCNT surface. Further evidence for the presence of P3HT coating came from SEM imaging. Pristine MWCNTs show a clean and smooth surface in Fig. 1d, whereas Fig. 1e reveals a distinctly different surface morphology for the MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposites, which is consistent with the TEM observation. Furthermore, as we can see in Fig. 2f, the pristine MWCNTs easily aggregate and leave a clear supernatant. But the prepared MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposites are well dispersed in hydrophobic solution (i.e., chloroform) for a long time due to the soluble P3HT shells. The MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposites obtained are stable in solution, which further proves that the grafting effectively occurs. The thermal stability and compositional analysis of the pristine MWCNT, P3HT, and MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposite were determined by TGA (Fig. 3). The P3HT homopolymer showed an obvious weight loss between 320 and 510 °C, which was similar to a reported work.24 As the pristine MWCNTs appeared to be thermally stable within this range, the weight component of P3HT in the MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposites was estimated to be 15%.

The UV-vis and PL spectra of the P3HT homopolymer, physically mixed MWCNT/P3HT, and MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposites in CHCl3 are presented in Fig. 4. As depicted in Fig. 4a, a solution of P3HT homopolymer exhibited an absorption band at 423 nm arising from the π–π* transition. The physically mixed MWCNT/P3HT with the same concentration of P3HT component (0.056 mg mL−1 in CHCl3 with P3HT component of 15 wt%) did not show any significant change in the P3HT absorption band, located at 424 nm, whereas, the P3HT absorption band of the MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposites was distinctly blue-shifted to 387 nm, which should be due to the chain conformation effect. P3HT chains grafted onto the surface of CNTs may convert from the original highly ordered conformation to a more disordered chain conformation, resulting in a decrease in the linear chain conformation.50 As shown in Fig. 4b, a solution of P3HT homopolymer (0.05 mg mL−1) exhibited an emission peak at 571 nm. Physically mixed MWCNT/P3HT (0.20 mg mL−1 in CHCl3 with P3HT component of 15 wt%) shows almost the same position as pure P3HT. It is well-known that CNTs are a good fluorescence quencher when in contact with fluorescent polymers.66 Thus, it was observed that the fluorescence emission of the physically mixed MWCNT/P3HT significantly decreased (∼58% quenched), which is due to the charge transfer at the interface of the MWCNT/P3HT blends. In particular, the emission intensity of the MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposites is much weaker than that of the physically mixed MWCNT/P3HT. It can be calculated from the fluorescence intensity that ∼88% of the fluorescence of P3HT in the MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposites is quenched. The PL emission was effectively quenched, indicating the formation of an intimate interface between P3HT and MWCNT, which facilitates the electron transfer from P3HT towards the MWCNTs. The PL data further prove that P3HT has been successfully clicked onto the surface of the MWCNTs.

To compare the electrical properties and thermoelectric performance of the MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposites and the mixed MWCNT/P3HT, flexible thermoelectric generators are designed and the fabrication process is shown in Fig. 5a. The detailed methods are presented in the experimental part. As depicted in Fig. 5b, the flexible device has a sandwich structure with a thermoelectric layer in the middle and two Ag films as the top and bottom electrodes. By connecting the two electrodes to the electrochemical analyzer with copper wires, the I–V characteristics of the thermoelectric devices are investigated and the results are illustrated in Fig. 5c. Both of the devices show linear I–V properties, demonstrating good ohmic contact between the thermoelectric layers and the electrodes. Forming ohmic contact is essential for the thermoelectric device because it can facilitate the charge transportation and enhance electric output. However, the generator based on the MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposites exhibits a smaller slope than that of the mixed MWCNT/P3HT one, which could be attributed to the decrease in the conductivity of the MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposites. Since P3HT is less electrically conductive than MWCNTs, the covalently attached P3HT shell in the MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposites would hinder the charge transport between the MWCNT bundles, acting like barriers, and hence decrease the conductivity.49 The thermoelectric properties of the devices were investigated by adopting a hot plate as a heat source to generate temperature differences (ΔT) between two Ag electrodes, as shown in Fig. 5d. When the hot plate is turned on, the ΔT will increase and an open-circuit voltage (VOC) between the two electrodes will be generated accordingly. Fig. 5e illustrates the VOC of two thermoelectric generators at a ΔT of 30 K. As can be observed, the device with MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposites delivers an output voltage of about 0.5 mV and a Seebeck coefficient of about 17 μV K−1, which are more than twice those of the mixed MWCNT/P3HT one (about 0.2 mV and 6.7 μV K−1). The enhancement of the thermoelectric properties could be attributed to the phonon scattering at the covalent interface between P3HT and MWCNTs in the MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposites.67 Based on the above results, the power factor (S2σ) of the MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposite device is calculated to be about twice that of the mixed MWCNT/P3HT device.

Conclusions
In this work, we provide an unconventional strategy for the fabrication of MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposites through a thiol–ene reaction, in which conductive polymer P3HT was covalently grafted onto the surface of MWCNTs. The successful clicking of P3HT onto the MWCNT surface was verified by NMR and FTIR measurements as well as TEM and SEM observations. The intimate and stable interaction between the MWCNTs and P3HT was characterized by UV-vis and PL spectroscopy. This covalent functionalization avoids the MWCNT agglomeration issue in organic solvents and enhances the flexibility of the MWCNTs. Moreover, the intimate and permanent connection between the MWCNTs and P3HT facilitates charge transfer at the interface from P3HT to the MWCNTs. As a result, the chemically connected MWCNT–P3HT nanocomposite film exhibits an improved Seebeck coefficient and power factor in a thermoelectric device.
