    , Accepted 22nd May 2017First published on 23rd May 2017AbstractA series of D–A1–D–A2 type regioregular copolymers based on difluorobenzothiadiazole (DFBT) and dialkoxybenzothiadiazole (ROBT) structures was synthesized. The copolymers were prepared with different alkyl chain lengths and branching point positions. The weaker acceptor, ROBT, was incorporated as a solubilizing moiety, while the stronger acceptor, DFBT, was used to enhance intramolecular charge transfer interactions with low-lying frontier orbital levels. The design of DFBT–ROBT copolymers ensures good planarity via intrachain noncovalent F⋯S, S⋯O, and F⋯H coulombic interactions. Changing the alkyl chain branching point and length had pronounced effects on the interchain packing and charge carrier transport/recombination characteristics of the resultant polymers, which in turn influenced their photovoltaic performances. P2 (with 3-hexylundecyloxy) showed tight π–π stacking, high charge mobility, reduced bimolecular charge recombination, and an optimal nanoscale morphology compared to P1 (with 2-hexyldecyloxy). We prepared photovoltaic devices containing a blend of the copolymers with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester, and the resultant devices showed high power conversion efficiencies, 8.27% for P2, which is higher than that of P1 (6.87%). Furthermore, the alkyl side-chain length in P2 was varied systematically to study the correlation between the alkyl chain length in the interchain packing and photovoltaic performances. The variation in the alkyl chain branching was effective to modulate intermolecular packing to improve the photovoltaic performances. The optimum side chain length should be determined by carefully considering the solubility and interchain packing interactions.
Introduction
During the last few decades, extensive research efforts have been devoted to polymer solar cells (PSCs). The combined contributions of chemists (designing novel materials) and physicists have resulted in devices with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) that exceed 10%.1–8 In organic or polymer semiconductors, the co-planarity of the backbone has a direct effect on the solid-state π–π stacking and effective delocalization of polarons and excitons,9–11 which improve the molecular ordering and charge carrier mobilities. In addition, crystalline materials have several advantages compared to their amorphous counterparts, such as low charge carrier recombination,12,13 inhibition of the diffusion of oxygen or other radicals that promote photo-oxidation,14 and good morphological and thermal stabilities.11,15 To optimize the photovoltaic polymers further, the choice of building blocks is crucial, and the molecular ordering and packing, as well as the electronic structure of the resultant polymers must be considered carefully. 2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole (BT) has been widely studied as an electron-deficient building unit for semi-crystalline and highly efficient PSCs. The 5- and 6-positions of BT can be functionalized easily by attaching either electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., alkoxy, fluorine, nitrile groups, etc.), which modulate the frontier orbital levels, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interactions, and oxidative stability.16–20
In terms of molecular engineering, considerable attention has been paid to controlling the alkyl chains in conjugated polymers. The chain type, length, and substitution position on the conjugated polymers directly affect the molecular packing and thin-film morphology and, hence, the device performance.3,21–24 Branched polymers have better solution processability than their linear counterparts, but branching often reduces the polymer crystallinity because of the steric bulkiness.21,25 Furthermore, many reports emphasized that the alkyl chain branching point can critically influence the molecular ordering, packing, and charge carrier properties in conjugated molecules.26–28 For example, Lei et al. discovered that moving the alkyl chain branching point away from the polymer backbone is an effective strategy to enhance the interchain ordering in isoindigo-based polymers.26 In their study, IIDDT-C3 with an alkyl chain branch three carbon atoms away from the polymer backbone showed a remarkably high hole mobility (3.62 cm2 V−1 s−1) compared to that of IIDDT (1.06 cm2 V−1 s−1), which has a branching point one carbon away from the polymer backbone. Similarly, Zhang et al. demonstrated the effects of the alkyl chain branching point on the film microstructure and the charge transport behavior in organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) based on naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives.27 Although similar approaches have been used in the design of semi-crystalline photovoltaic polymers,29,30 there has been a lack of systematic study in the PSC research field.
Here, we report five regioregular D–A1–D–A2 type semi-crystalline photovoltaic copolymers containing difluorobenzothiadiazole (DFBT) and dialkoxybenzothiadiazole (ROBT) as two acceptors with modulated alkyl chain branching points and chain lengths: poly{4-(5-(5,6-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole} (P1), poly{4-(5-(5,6-bis(3-hexylundecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazole} (P2), poly{4-(5-(5,6-bis(3-octylundecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole} (P3), poly{4-(5-(5,6-bis(3-octyltridecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole} (P4), and poly{4-(5-(5,6-bis(3-decyltridecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazol-4-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-5,6-difluoro-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole} (P5). Recently, D–A1–D–A2 type alternating polymers have emerged as an alternative molecular design strategy for photoactive polymers which comprise three components with one donor and two different acceptors on their conjugated polymer backbones.20,31–35 Therefore, D–A1–D–A2 polymers allow broad light absorption via two different donor–acceptor ICT interactions.36,37 Here, we designed the polymers based on the D–A1–D–A2 structure in a different way. The stronger acceptor, DFBT, was used to achieve a low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level and ROBT was used to improve the solubility of the resulting copolymers. Additionally, the chemical structures of DFBT and ROBT have fluorine and alkoxy substituents, respectively, and the interunit torsion angles can be reduced by intrachain coulombic, dipole–dipole interactions such as F⋯O, C–F⋯H, F⋯S, and S⋯O interactions, leading to a planar polymer chain.11,15–17,38–40 The structural similarity of DFBT and ROBT, which are based on the same BT unit, may minimize the disruption of the semi-crystalline morphology of the copolymers. Using this design strategy, it is also possible to fine-tune the frontier energy levels and solution processability. We demonstrate that the alkyl chain branching point strongly affects the interchain packing rather than the side-chain length, and a P2-based PSC blended with [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) showed the best PCE (8.27%) of the devices prepared. Our results provide valuable information on a design strategy for further optimizing the molecular structure of polymers for photovoltaic devices.
Results and discussion
The chemical structures and synthetic routes of the intermediates, monomers, and polymers are shown in Schemes 1 and S1.† 4,7-Dibromo-5,6-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (M1)21 and 5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(5-(trimethylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (M6)11 were prepared according to previously reported methods. The monomers with an alkyl chain branching point two carbon atoms away from the polymer backbone, 4,7-dibromo-5,6-bis(3-hexylundecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (M2), 4,7-dibromo-5,6-bis(3-octylundecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (M3), 4,7-dibromo-5,6-bis(3-octyltridecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (M4), and 4,7-dibromo-5,6-bis(3-decyltridecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (M5), were synthesized from the corresponding alcohols (3-hexylundecan-1-ol (2), 3-octylundecan-1-ol (4), 3-octyltridecan-1-ol (6), and 3-decyltridecan-1-ol (8)). The preparation of 3-hexylundecan-1-ol (2) was achieved from 7-(bromomethyl)pentadecane. The Grignard reagent of 7-(bromomethyl)pentadecane was quenched with dry ice and acidification with HCl yielded 3-hexylundecanoic acid. The reduction of 3-hexylundecanoic acid with lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) afforded 3-hexylundecan-1-ol (2). 3-Octylundecan-1-ol (4) was prepared from 9-heptadecanone. The Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons (HWE) reaction of 9-heptadecanone with ethyl 2-(diethoxyphosphoryl)acetate was carried out under reflux conditions, yielding the conjugated ester ethyl 3-octylundec-2-enoate in good yield. The hydrogenation of the double bond using a catalytic amount of PtO2 proceeded smoothly, and the resulting ethyl 3-octylundecanoate was hydrolyzed to afford 3-octylundecan-1-ol (4). 3-Octyltridecan-1-ol (6) was formed by following the same procedure as that of 3-hexylundecan-1-ol (2). The preparation of 3-decyltridecan-1-ol (8) was achieved from 11-(2-iodoethyl)heneicosane. The nucleophilic substitution of 11-(2-iodoethyl)heneicosane (7) to form 3-decyltridecyl acetate (7a) was followed by hydrolysis to afford the final alcohol 3-decyltridecan-1-ol (8).
 Scheme 1  Synthetic routes to monomers and polymers. 
Detailed synthetic procedures are described in the ESI.† The final copolymers (P1 to P5) were synthesized in 52–75% yields via the microwave assisted Stille coupling reaction of the DFBT monomer (M6) and ROBT monomers (M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5) using tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd(dba)3) and tri(o-tolyl)phosphine as the catalysts in chlorobenzene (CB). After finishing the polymerization reaction, the polymers were precipitated into methanol and purified by Soxhlet extraction using acetone, hexane and chloroform (CF) (or chlorobenzene (CB) for P2 and P3). All the polymers were obtained as shiny brown solids, and their molecular weights were found to range from 68.3 to 86.0 kDa by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Table 1). Because of the similar molecular weights of the polymers, we can exclude molecular weight effects that may influence molecular ordering and film morphology. P1, which has 2-hexyldecyloxy substituents, was soluble in common organic solvents, such as CF and CB, whereas P2, which has 3-hexylundecyloxy side-chains, and P3, which has 3-octylundecyloxy side-chains, were not soluble in CF but were soluble in CB and o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB). Interestingly, a slight increase in alkyl chain length led to the improved solubility of P4 (3-octyltridecyloxy) and P5 (3-decyltridecyloxy), even in CF.

The ultraviolet−visible (UV−vis) absorption spectra of all the polymers in CB solution and in the film state are shown in Fig. 1a and b. All the polymers displayed two absorption bands at 300–400 and 500–750 nm, which originate from the localized π–π* transitions and ICT interactions between the donor and acceptor units, respectively.41 All the polymers have similar spectra in CB, but the spectra of polymers P2–P5 in film contain a clearly intensified shoulder peak at ∼670 nm, suggestive of stronger interchain π–π stacking in the solid state compared to that in P1.26 This may be closely related to the different branching points in the alkoxy side-chains in P1 and P2–P5. Polymers P2–P5 (where the branching point is at C3) have two spacer carbon atoms between the main chain and the branching point but different chain lengths, and these polymers have similar absorption spectra, indicating that the increase in the alkyl chain length has little effect on the absorption properties. Therefore, the alkyl chain branching point, rather than the side-chain length, is expected to affect the interchain packing strongly. The absorption onsets of the polymers in the film state were measured in the range 738–750 nm, and the corresponding optical band gaps were calculated to be in the range 1.65–1.68 eV. Detailed optical properties are summarized in Table 1.
 Fig. 1  Absorption spectra of the polymers (a) in CB solution and (b) in film. (c) Energy band diagram and (d) TGA plots of the polymers. 
The frontier orbital energy levels of the polymers were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S1† and Table 1), and the resulting energy band diagram is illustrated in Fig. 1c. The HOMO energy levels of all polymers were determined from the onset oxidation potential relative to the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) system. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of each polymer was calculated from the HOMO level and its optical band gap in the film state. The HOMO and LUMO levels became higher in energy as the branching point in the alkoxy side-chains changed (HOMO: −5.64 eV (P1) to −5.53 eV (P2); LUMO: −3.96 eV (P1) to −3.87 eV (P2)). This variation in frontier energy levels is attributed to stronger interchain stacking in P2. It has been previously reported that polymers having alkyl chains branching away from the polymer backbone show tight molecular stacking, resulting in higher energy HOMOs.26 However, further increasing the side-chain length from 3-hexylundecyloxy (P2) to 3-decyltridecyloxy (P5) caused a gradual lowering of the electronic energy levels [HOMO = −5.53 eV (P2), −5.61 eV (P5); LUMO = −3.87 eV (P2), −3.95 eV (P5)]. This variation may be because larger alkyl chains decrease the aggregation and effective conjugation in the P3 to P5 polymer films in comparison with those in P2. The thermal properties of the copolymers were investigated using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The decomposition temperatures with 5% weight loss (Td) were determined to be 305, 317, 306, 303, and 297 °C for P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5, respectively, probably because of the bond cleavage of the alkoxy side-chains at first (Fig. 1d). No phase transitions were observed in the DSC measurements of the polymers between 25 and 250 °C (Fig. S1†).
The influence of the side-chain branching point on the molecular packing was studied by two-dimensional (2D) grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). Fig. 2 shows the GIWAXS images and the corresponding out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) line-cut profiles of the neat P1 and P2 films, and the resulting packing parameters are summarized in Table 2. The neat film of P1 shows (100) and (200) diffraction peaks along the OOP direction, with a corresponding lamellar distance of 20.8 Å. The π–π stacking and lamella peaks were also observed along the IP direction (d(010) = 3.7 Å and d(100) = 22.2 Å). In contrast, the thin film of P2 showed a long range, well-ordered structure with pronounced (100), (200), and (300) diffraction peaks in the OOP direction (dOOP = 23.2 Å). Additionally, P2 also displayed (010) peaks in both OOP and IP directions (a d-spacing of 3.6 and 3.5 Å, respectively), suggesting a bimodal structure with a mix of edge-on and face-on orientations. Compared to P1, P2 showed intense diffraction from the (010) plane and a shorter π–π stacking distance (3.7 Å for P1 and 3.5–3.6 Å for P2). These results indicate that moving the alkyl chain branching point away from the polymer backbone is advantageous for inducing greater molecular ordering and stronger π–π stacking interactions.

The charge carrier mobility in organic semiconductors strongly depends on the molecular ordering and packing. Therefore, the hole mobility of the polymers was evaluated by the space charge limited current (SCLC)42 method for the hole-only device (indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)(PEDOT:PSS)/polymer/Au) (Fig. S2†). P1 and P2 were found to have hole mobilities of 1.33 × 10−4 and 1.83 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The hole mobility of P2 was found to be one order higher than that of P1, arising from its stronger intermolecular packing and semi-crystalline 3D network structures in both IP and OOP directions.
We investigated the photovoltaic properties of copolymers with a conventional device architecture (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al). The fabrication of PSC devices was optimized by varying the processing solvents, polymer:PC71BM blend ratio, active layer thickness, and additives (Fig. S3–S5 and Tables S1–S3†). The ∼100 nm thick PSCs were found to be optimized with a polymer:PC71BM blend ratio of 1:1.5 and using CB as a processing solvent with 3 vol% diphenyl ether (DPE). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves under simulated AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) in air are presented in Fig. 3a, and the resulting photovoltaic characteristics are summarized in Table 3. The devices containing the polymers P2, P3, and P4 had PCEs of 8.27, 7.84, and 7.38%, respectively. These values are substantially higher than that (6.87%) of the device containing P1. The marked difference in the performances arises from the significant difference in the short-circuit current (JSC) and form factor (FF). The P2:PC71BM device showed the highest PCE of 8.27% with a JSC of 14.49 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.85 V, and an FF of 67%. The maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of P2:PC71BM was 73% at 640 nm. Among the polymers, P1 showed the highest VOC (0.89 V) because of its low-lying HOMO energy level, while the VOC values of the P2–P5 polymers were similar because of their similar HOMO energies. The JSC in this series of PSCs decreased as the side-chain length increased (from P2 to P5). Because these polymers have the same absorption properties, the changes may be attributed to the variation in molecular ordering and packing, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology, and the resulting charge carrier transport/recombination.

To correlate the photovoltaic performances with the BHJ film morphology, we analyzed the intermolecular orientation and packing in the polymer:PC71BM photoactive films using 2D-GIWAXS (Fig. 4, Table S4†). Interestingly, all the blend films show significant π–π stacking diffraction peaks in the OOP direction, suggesting that the molecular orientations are significantly different from those of the neat polymer films. As the polymer side-chain length increases, the lamellar distances increase in both the OOP (23.4 to 25.5 Å) and IP (21.8 to 23.7 Å) directions (Table S4†). As the alkyl chain length increases, the intensities of both the (010) OOP and (100) IP diffraction peaks decrease considerably, and the π–π stacking distance increases (P2:PC71BM (3.5 Å) to P3–P5:PC71BM (3.6–3.7 Å)) because of the presence of the longer side-chains that disrupt the interchain aggregation. We also compared the pole figures of the polymers extracted from their (100) lamellar diffraction profiles in the GIWAXS images (Fig. 4h). As in previous reports, the integrated peak area with a polar angle (χ) of 0–45° and 135–180° (Axy), and 55–125° (Az) represents the fractions of face-on and edge-on crystallites, respectively.43–45 To determine the polymer crystallite orientation, the Axy/Az ratio was calculated to be 0.62, 0.77, and 0.26 for P1:PC71BM, P2:PC71BM, and P3:PC71BM, respectively. The population of the face-on orientation in P2:PC71BM was found to be substantially higher than in other polymers, which is beneficial for efficient charge transport in a vertical direction.45,46

Strong interchain ordering with tight π–π stacking is necessary to achieve efficient exciton diffusion47 and charge carrier mobility,48 resulting in higher JSC and FF values. The hole-only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Au) and electron-only devices (ITO/ZnO/polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE)49/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al) were prepared under optimum device fabrication conditions to measure the hole and electron mobilities for polymer:PC71BM blend films (Fig. S6,†Table 3). The SCLC devices fabricated with P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 were found to have vertical hole (electron) mobility values of 7.22 × 10−5 (1.58 × 10−4), 3.19 × 10−4 (1.77 × 10−4), 1.85 × 10−4 (1.47 × 10−4), 1.59 × 10−4 (1.20 × 10−4), and 8.93 × 10−5 (6.53 × 10−5) cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher hole and electron mobilities in P2:PC71BM are in good agreement with the stronger face-on orientation and tighter π–π stacking compared to other polymers. The well-balanced and higher charge mobilities in the P2, P3 and P4 blends are expected to be beneficial to reduce electron–hole recombination during a charge sweep-out process.14,50
In polymer:PC71BM blend films, charge generation/recombination also plays a crucial role in determining the photovoltaic performances of the resultant PSCs.21,41 Therefore, we studied the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) in the PSCs (Fig. S7†). Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the photocurrent densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is given as Veff = Vo − V, where V is the applied bias voltage and Vo is the voltage when Jph = 0.51,52 In these copolymers, Jph was not saturated even at Veff ≥ 2 V, suggesting significant monomolecular or bimolecular recombination. The Jph values were measured to be 9.48, 12.22, 11.52, 11.20, and 8.46 mA cm−2 at the maximum power point for P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5, respectively, and a similar trend was observed for JSC values. As shown in the J–V curves at a varied light intensity (Fig. S8†), all PSCs showed efficient charge sweep-out at low light intensities up to 63 mW cm−2, but the charge sweep-out deteriorated at greater light intensities. To understand the details of charge recombination in the polymer blends, we studied the light-intensity-dependent JSC and VOC characteristics. Fig. 5a shows the double logarithmic plots of JSC as a function of the incident light intensity for all PSCs, and the solid lines show the fitting curves according to the power law JSC ∝ Pα, where P and α represent the incident light intensity and an exponential constant, respectively. A value of α = 1 indicates that all the carriers are swept out prior to recombination.53,54 In these PSCs, the α values were found to be 0.90, 0.94, 0.92, 0.92, and 0.92 for P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5, respectively. Consequently, the P2:PC71BM PSC is expected to have the smallest bimolecular recombination, showing good agreement with the measured J–V characteristics. Fig. 5b shows a semi-logarithmic plot of VOCversus light intensity, which shows a linear relationship with a slope of kBT/q, where the factors kB, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature, and elementary charge, respectively.41,55,56 The PSCs composed of P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 had slopes of 1.04kBT/q, 1.04kBT/q, 1.06kBT/q, 1.06kBT/q, and 1.23kBT/q, respectively. Based on both the JSC and VOC data with varying light intensity, bimolecular electron–hole recombination is the main loss mechanism in this series of polymers. We believe that P5:PC71BM has a relatively high trap-assisted or Shockley–Read–Hall recombination based on the larger slope of 1.23kBT/q in the VOCversus light intensity curve. This may be related to the BHJ film morphology with poor crystalline packing because of the excessively long side-chains (3-decyltridecyloxy).

The nanoscale morphology of the polymer:PC71BM blends was measured to investigate the correlation between the BHJ morphology and the photovoltaic properties. Fig. 6 shows the tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of photoactive blend films. In the AFM height images, the polymer:PC71BM films with P2, P3, and P4 show smooth and homogeneously intermixed film morphology with root mean square (RMS) roughness values of 1.18, 1.11, and 1.06 nm, respectively. The TEM images further reveal the formation of well distributed nanofibrillar structures of polymers in the P2, P3, and P4 blend films (Fig. 6b–d). This nanoscale morphology with a bicontinuous D–A interpenetrating network that forms percolation pathways is beneficial for the efficient transport of charge carriers.11,21 In contrast, the P1 and P5 blend films showed relatively higher RMS roughness values of 1.59 and 1.70 nm. Moreover, P1:PC71BM and P5:PC71BM both showed a coarser phase separation of the polymer and PC71BM domains. This must be related to the different branch point position in P1 and the excessively long side-chains in P5 that influence the interchain packing and the resulting BHJ phase separation. The exciton diffusion length is a few nanometers in PSCs, and coarse phase separation has been shown to reduce the effective exciton diffusion and dissociation at the polymer:PC71BM interface.57,58 Consequently, these results emphasize that even a small change in the alkyl chain branching point and length plays a critical role in determining the (1) interchain organization of polymers, (2) nanoscale BHJ morphology, and (3) charge carrier generation/transport/recombination properties, which have significant effects on the photovoltaic device performance.

Conclusions
D–A1–D–A2 type photovoltaic copolymers based on DFBT and ROBT moieties were designed with different side-chain branch positions and chain lengths. Two different benzothiadiazole-based electron-deficient (A1 and A2) moieties were incorporated into the polymer backbone, where DFBT decreases the HOMO level and ROBT improves the solution processability. By utilizing the structural similarity of DFBT and ROBT, we also tried to minimize the disruption to the semi-crystalline morphology, as seen in the D–A-type alternating copolymer, poly(thiophene-benzothiadiazole) (PTBT) reported previously.16 The modification of the side-chain branching point and length had a marked effect on the polymer solubility, optoelectronic properties, molecular ordering, charge carrier transport/recombination, and the resulting photovoltaic performances. P1 (2-hexyldecyloxy) and P2 (3-hexylundecyloxy) with different chain branch points exhibited PCEs of 6.87 and 8.27%, respectively. The enhanced efficiency in P2 is mainly ascribed to the reduced π–π stacking distance and high electron/hole mobility with little charge recombination, which result in a higher photocurrent density. Moving the branching point away from the polymer backbone was effective in increasing the molecular ordering and increasing the π–π stacking interactions. Furthermore, increasing the side-chain length in P2 was also attempted, as demonstrated by P3 (3-octylundecyloxy), P4 (3-octyltridecyloxy), and P5 (3-decyltridecyloxy), where the different side-chain lengths also influence the solubility, electrochemical behavior and packing of the polymers. Consequently, the side-chain length and the branch point position must be optimized carefully to fine-tune the solubility and interchain packing interactions by considering the polymeric main chain structure.
