    , Accepted 13th July 2018First published on 16th July 2018AbstractTuning the structure of both polymer donors and acceptors, and development of novel matched donor/acceptor pairs are essential steps to enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability of all-polymer solar cells (PSCs). Here, two weakly crystalline wide band-gap polymer donors PBDT(T)-HT-TPD and PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD with different side chains were synthesized by incorporating an alkyl-thiophene π-bridge, PBDT(T)TPD-based 2D-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene (BDT) and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) as reference donors. Three highly crystalline narrow-bandgap polymer acceptors P(NDI2OD-T), P(NDI2OD-Se) and P(NDI2HD-Se) sharing a similar backbone structure were also synthesized and studied. The all-PSCs were fabricated to investigate the synergetic effect of the alkyl-thiophene π-bridge and side chain modification. As a result, the PBDT(T)-HT-TPD/P(NDI2HD-Se) system is an optimal donor/acceptor combination due to its complementary light absorption and well-balanced miscibility/crystallinity, in which the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.80% is achieved without extra-treatment. Meanwhile, the stability test of the devices shows that the incorporation of the alkyl-thiophene π-bridge can enhance thermal and storage stability. This work demonstrates that increasing the amorphous region of the donor to an appropriate degree provides an enhancement in the miscibility and morphology stability with highly crystalline acceptors, which will result in stable all-PSCs with high PCE.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) based on non-fullerene acceptors, developed quite recently, have shown many advantages over the polymer-fullerene system, such as tunable chemical and electronic properties for both materials, enhanced light absorbance, etc.1–5 In the past two years, a lot of novel non-fullerene small molecule acceptors have shown great achievements with some drawbacks.6–16 They are highly crystalline and exhibit an unstable morphology in blend films. However, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), which are composed of binary blends of polymer donors/polymer acceptors, offer unique morphological stability to thermal and mechanical stress for practical applications as flexible devices, while lack of suitable polymer donors/acceptors limits their power conversion efficiency (PCE) to a value lower than those of the PSCs based on fullerene derivatives or organic small molecule acceptors.17 To date, using limited polymer acceptors/donors, the PCEs of all-PSCs have reached 7–10%.18–23 Prominent polymer acceptors are developed from NDI,24 PDI25 or P-BNBP-fBT26 or PZ1.27 Among naphthalene diimide (NDI)-based polymers, for example, poly[[n,n′-9-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)] N2200 and poly[[n,n′-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-thiophene] P(NDI2HD-T) are the most successful polymer acceptors so far. It is worth noting that most previous studies have used N2200 as the optimal acceptor and focused on the development of a novel p-type donor suitable for pairing with N2200 leading to a high PCE of over 10%.28 However, these high PCEs of more than 8% were mostly obtained under the active layers which were thermally annealed to optimize the blend morphology. Considering that thermal annealing will be a challenge in the fabrication of large area flexible PSCs, it is significant to develop high performance all-PSCs without extra-treatment. We should realize that subtle changes in acceptor or donor molecular structures may also have a significant impact on the material optoelectronic properties, processing parameters, blend morphology, and the resulting device performances. Efforts to achieve high performance all-PSCs were thus mainly focused on tuning the structure of both polymer donors and acceptors and the development of a novel matched donor/acceptor combination.29–31 The current device performances of the all-PSCs are believed to be hindered by limited charge separation or charge transport in the all-polymer film, depending on the specific polymer D/A combination. Thus, to further improve the device performances, the effect of tuning the structure of both polymer acceptors and donors on optical absorption, energy levels, crystallinity and device performances should be thoroughly studied. Further developing a new rational combination of polymer donors/acceptors for high performance and stable all-PSCs without extra treatment is desired.
Among the stable all-PSCs with high PCE without extra-treatment, some good examples composed of donors PBDT-TPDs (based on 2D-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene (BDT) and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD)) and acceptors PNDI-Ts (based on naphthalene diimide (NDI) and thiophene (T)) have been reported. Kim et al. reported a high Voc of 1.06 V and a PCE of 6.6% achieved in the all-PSC based PBDTTTPD/P(ND2HD-T);32 furthermore, they reported their excellent thermal stability.33 Wang et al. reported a high Voc of 1.1 V and a PCE of 8.0% achieved in the all-PSC based PBDTS-TPD/PNDI-T (PND2OD-T).34 Herein, encouraged by the high PCE of the stable all-PSC based PBDT-TPDs/PNDI-Ts system without thermal treatment, two wide band-gap polymers PBDT(T)-HT-TPD and PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD were synthesized as electron donors by the incorporation of the alkyl-thiophene π-bridge to achieve a higher PCE. In particular, compared with PBDT(T)TPD, PBDT(T)-HT-TPD has relatively low crystallinity because the incorporation of the alkyl-thiophene π-bridge can break the symmetrical arrangement of the polymer main chain. PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD was synthesized by introducing the linear alkylthio-side chain and a sulfur atom at the BDT unit to improve the solubility and downshift the HOMO level of the resulting polymer. PNDI-T(PNDI-Se) is known as a semi-crystalline acceptor with high crystallinity;35 then, three acceptors P(NDI2OD-T), P(NDI2OD-Se) and P(NDI2HD-Se) sharing a similar backbone structure were synthesized.
For the nano-morphology of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ), the suppression of excessive aggregation is important because it often leads to oversized segregated domains. Therefore, the exceedingly high crystallinity of donors is not favorable because it can facilitate oversized segregation leading to poor miscibility although a highly ordered morphology results in high charge mobility.36 Thus, well-balanced crystallinity/miscibility is needed to obtain high efficiency all-PSCs by pairing the weakly crystalline donor PBDT(T)-HT-TPD (PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD) and the highly crystalline acceptor PNDI-T(PNDT-Se). Furthermore, the wide band-gap donor PBDT(T)-HT-TPD (PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD) shows complementary absorption with the acceptor PNDI-T(PNDI-Se) and the low-lying HOMO level, which is expected to produce high Jsc and Voc. Overall, by incorporating the alkyl-thiophene π-bridge and modifying the side chain, a new rational combination of donor and acceptor polymers would be found to obtain high performance all-PSCs without extra-treatment. All polymers were systematically studied in our work. The corresponding all-PSCs were also fabricated to investigate the synergetic effect of the alkyl-thiophene π-bridge and side chain modification. Our results reveal that the donor PBDT(T)-HT-TPD with the lowest crystallinity is an optimal donor for the acceptor P(NDI2HD-Se) with a highly crystalline character. Meanwhile, the stability test of the devices shows that the incorporation of the alkyl-thiophene π-bridge can enhance thermal and storage stability.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the chemical structure of the polymer donors and acceptors. Encouraged by the high PCE of the stable all-PSC based PBDT-TPDs/PNDI-Ts system, two wide band-gap polymers PBDT(T)-HT-TPD and PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD with different side-chains were synthesized as donors by the incorporation of the alkyl-thiophene π-bridge into the polymer main chain, PBDT(T)TPD, serves as a reference donor for comparison. Three widely used polymer acceptors P(NDI2OD-T), P(NDI2OD-Se) and P(NDI2HD-Se) sharing a similar backbone structure were synthesized due to their highly crystalline behavior. PBDT(T)-HT-TPD, PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD and P(NDI2HD-Se) were synthesized by Stille coupling following a procedure in the literature with slight modification.37 PBDT(T)TPD, P(NDI2OD-T) and P(NDI2OD-Se) were synthesized using procedures described in our previous work,38 and the synthetic details are shown in the ESI.† All polymers were soluble in common organic solvents. Two polymer donors show comparable number average molecular weights (Mn) of 17.9 kg mol−1 and 19.1 kg mol−1 with polydispersities (PDI) of 2.91 and 3.45, respectively. Three polymer acceptors show reasonable Mn and PDI values, which are comparable to previous reports in the literature thus minimizing the effects of molecular weight on polymer properties.19,36 All these polymers show good thermal stability as revealed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with a decomposition temperature of over 350 °C (Fig. S3, ESI†). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) reveals that the two donors exhibit no clear melting and crystalline peaks along the heating and cooling cycle, suggesting that they may exhibit weakly crystalline behavior in the solid state (Fig. S4, ESI†), which may favor a more miscible morphology of the blending acceptor with highly crystalline behavior.
 Fig. 1  The structure of polymers. 
The light absorption of polymers was characterized by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy of dilute (10−6 mol L−1) chloroform solutions and of thin films on glass substrates. The corresponding spectra and data are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. The UV-vis absorption of the donor PBDT(T)TPD film is also shown in Fig. 2b. In dilute solution, all polymer acceptors show the same peak positions with two distinct absorption bands at 300–400 nm and 500–700 nm which can be assigned to the π → π* or n → π* transition of the NDI chromophore and an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) band from T(Se) to NDI, respectively.39 Both PBDT(T)-HT-TPD and PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD present similar absorption bands at 400–650 nm. The absorption spectra of all polymers are red-shifted in films due to enhanced π → π stacking and intermolecular interactions in the solid state.40 Compared with the PBDT(T)TPD film, the PBDT(T)-HT-TPD film shows a blue-shift absorption band, which is due to the incorporation of the alkyl-thiophene π-bridge. Compared with the PBDT(T)-HT-TPD film, the PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD film presents a slightly broader absorption spectrum. This is probably due to the linear alkyl-thio side chains, which can promote the packing of polymer chains. A similar absorption property was observed from a BDT(ST)-based polymer.41 Meanwhile, red shift is detected in P(NDI2OD-Se) by substituting the thiophene moiety on the backbone with selenophene, indicating that the selenophene moiety can enhance light-harvesting relative to thiophene. The P(NDI2HD-Se) film with shorter side-chains displays a broader absorption spectrum from 500 to 800 nm, which demonstrates that the polymer acceptor with shorter side-chains has better coplanarity resulting in strong interactions between polymer chains. It is worth noting that PBDT(T)-HT-TPD or PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD exhibits complementary absorption with P(NDI2HD-Se) or P(NDI2OD-Se), which is beneficial for light-harvesting. The optical band gaps of the polymers estimated using the absorption onsets of the thin films are shown in Table 1. PBDT(T)-HT-TPD and PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD film absorption onsets of 670 and 689 nm correspond to a wide optical band-gap of 1.85 eV and 1.80 eV, indicating that they are wide band-gap donors.

The LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the polymers were evaluated from cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S5, ESI†). As depicted in the energy diagram in Fig. 2(c), the HOMO energy levels of donors PBDT(T)-HT-TPD and PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD were measured as −5.30 and −5.32 eV, respectively, while the corresponding LUMO energy levels were measured as −3.45 and −3.49 eV. It is found that there was only a slight decrease in the LUMO and HOMO levels of PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD, which can be explained by the combined effects of the sulfur atoms and linear side chains.42 The HOMO energy levels of acceptors P(NDI2OD-T), P(NDI2OD-Se) and P(NDI2HD-Se) were measured as −5.70, −5.57, and −5.56 eV, respectively, while the corresponding LUMO energy levels were measured as −3.86, −3.82 and −3.80 eV, respectively. In this work, the LUMO–LUMO and HOMO–HOMO offsets between our obtained donors and acceptors are enough to provide enough driving force for efficient exciton dissociation at the D/A interface.
To explore the synergetic effect of the alkyl-thiophene π-bridge and side chain modification on photovoltaic properties, two BDT–TPD based polymers (PBDT(T)-HT-TPD and PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD) as donors and three NDI-based polymers (P(NDI2OD-T), P(NDI2OD-Se) and P(NDI2HD-Se)) as acceptors were used to fabricate all-PSCs with a conventional device configuration, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Al. The optimized donor:acceptor blend ratio was 1.5:1 (w/w) with chloroform (a small amount of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)) and the optimal active layer thickness was about 80 nm for all cases, and the detailed optimization conditions of the all-PSCs are described in Table S1 (ESI†). It is noted that the Jsc and FF values of these devices gradually decreased as the thickness of the active layer increased from 80 nm. The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves and the corresponding external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of all-PSCs are given in Fig. 3. The relevant photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2, and for comparison, the corresponding data of reference devices based on PBDT(T)TPD in our previous work are listed in Table S2 (ESI†).

As shown in Table 2 and Table S2 (ESI†), for the donor shifting from PBDT(T)TPD to PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD and PBDT(T)-HT-TPD, Jsc increased from 3.71 to 7.63 and 8.40 mA cm−2 in P(NDI2OD-T)-based devices, while Jsc increased from 8.56 to 7.81 and 11.97 mA cm−2 in P(NDI2OD-Se)-based devices. Thus, in comparison with the devices with PBDT(T)TPD as the donor, obviously enhanced PCEs (from 4.60% to 5.97% for P(NDI2OD-Se), from 3.0% to 4.55% for P(NDI2OD-Se)) were obtained in the devices with PBDT(T)-HT-TPD as the donor. It is clear that the Voc of the PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD-based devices slightly increased with the incorporation of the S atom in the donor BDT backbone owing to the deepening of the HOMO levels, which agrees well with the reported literature.43 However, despite their increased Voc (0.95–0.98 V), PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD-based devices show lower PCEs than PBDT(T)-HT-TPD-based devices because of a large drop in Jsc. This is contradictory to the fact that most BDT(ST)-based polymers have been shown to lead to improved OPV devices, which may be due to the poor miscibility/crystallinity balance in PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD BHJ compared to that in PBDT(T)-HT-TPD BHJ. The order of PCE values of PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD-based devices is as follows: for P(NDI2HD-Se) (4.63%) > for P(NDI2OD-Se) (4.22%) > for P(NDI2OD-T) (3.87%), and the same order is observed in PBDT(T)-HT-TPD-based devices: for P(NDI2HD-Se) (6.80%) > for P(NDI2OD-Se) (5.97%) > for P(NDI2OD-T) (4.55%).
The results indicate that incorporation of the alkyl-thiophene π-bridge at BDT–TPD-based polymer leads to a lower crystallinity which can improve the performance by matching well the highly crystalline acceptor. Nevertheless, tuning the side chain from branched alkyl- to linear alkylthio- has no positive influence on the device performance due to the poor miscibility/crystallinity balance in the blend. Therefore, PBDT(T)-HT-TPD/P(NDI2HD-Se)-based devices show the best performance, with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 12.52 mA cm−2, an FF of 58.7%, and a corresponding PCE of 6.80%. The enhanced complementary absorption and miscibility favored by the introduction of the alkyl-thiophene π-bridge at the donor and side chain modification of the acceptor boosted the Jsc.
External quantum efficiencies (EQEs) were measured for the optimized all-PSCs to evaluate the spectral response of the all-PSCs and the accuracy of the photocurrent density from the J–V measurements. As shown in Fig. 3b, the measured Jsc values for the all-PSCs were consistent with the integrated Jsc values obtained from the EQE spectra. The EQE spectra of these devices displayed a broad EQE response from 300 nm to 750 nm, indicating that both the acceptor and donor contributed to light harvesting. In comparison with PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD-based devices using the same acceptor, PBDT(T)-HT-TPD-based devices exhibit an obvious enhancement of the EQE response over the entire wavelength, which agrees with the Jsc of the corresponding device. Among these devices, PBDT(T)-HT-TPD/P(NDI2HD-Se)-based devices present relatively high EQEs with the maximum EQE over 60% in the range of 550–650 nm. Notably, these devices were only fabricated by using a simple spin-coating process without extra treatment and a buffer layer, which was helpful for the fabrication of large area flexible PSCs.
In order to study the efficiencies of exciton dissociation, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained from PBDT(T)-HT-TPD/acceptor and PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD/acceptor blend films (1.5:1 w:w), and donor and acceptor neat films. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the PL peaks of the neat donors and acceptors are around 670 nm and 750 nm, respectively. Although PBDT(T)-HT-TPD-based devices and PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD-based devices exhibited different photovoltaic properties, similarly high PL quenching efficiencies were observed, implying that no large phase separation and effective charge transfer at the D/A interface occurred in any of blend films.
To further understand the photovoltaic properties of the all-PSCs, the charge carrier mobilities of polymer:polymer blends were characterized by using SCLC measurements. Both hole-only and electron-only device configurations were employed. The SCLC fits are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†) and the SCLC mobilities are summarized in Table 2. It is known that high and well-balanced hole and electron mobilities are the key factors to suppress charge recombination and boost Jsc and FF of PSCs. As shown in Table 2, when blending with the same acceptor, the PBDT(T)-HT-TPD-based blend shows higher hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) values and a more balanced μh/μe compared to the PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD-based blend. In addition, when blending with the same donor, the P(NDI2HD-Se)-based blend exhibits the highest μe(μh) value, probably due to its highest crystallinity. The highest μh(μe) and appropriate μh/μe values were obtained in the PBDT(T)-HT-TPD/P(NDI2HD-Se) BHJ film. This indicated that PBDT(T)-HT-TPD and P(NDI2HD-Se) played beneficial roles with respect to each other in terms of nano-morphology. Their sufficient miscibility suppressed the excessive aggregation of the crystalline acceptor P(NDI2HD-Se), while sizable orientation of both was maintained, leading to good hole and electron transport in the devices. The well-balanced charge transport behavior of the PBDT(T)-HT-TPD/P(NDI2HD-Se) blend was well correlated with the obtained highest Jsc values. In addition, compared with PBDT(T)TPD-based blends in our previous work (Table S2, ESI†), PBDT(T)-HT-TPD-based blends in this work exhibit better balanced hole/electron mobilities, which can suppress charge recombination and maximize the photocurrent and FF of solar cells.44 As a result, the improvement in charge transport in PBDT(T)-HT-TPD-based blends may be the key factor that accounts for the higher Jsc and FF values.
XRD was used to investigate the molecular packing and the crystallinity of polymer donor and acceptor pristine films and blend films. As shown in Fig. 4, PBDT(T)-HT-TPD and PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD pristine films exhibited (100) reflection peaks with lamellar stacking distances (d100) of 20.70 Å and 24.50 Å, while they exhibited a broad and weak (010) reflection peak with π–π stacking distances (d010) of 4.05 Å and 4.00 Å. The coherence length (Lc) of the crystalline domains measured from the stacking peaks using the Scherrer equation is listed in Table S3 (ESI†).45 The equation is Lc = Kλ/βcosθ, where K is the shape factor (0.9), λ is the X-ray wavelength (1.54 Å), and β is the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) value (rad) of the stacking peak. The FWHM values were obtained from Gaussian fitting (shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S8, ESI†). Compared to reference PBDT(T)TPD (Lc = 7.43 nm, 1.20 nm), a decreased Lc value (Lc = 3.46 nm, 1.10 nm) is observed in PBDT(T)-HT-TPD, indicating that the incorporation of the alky-thiophene π bridge can break the symmetrical arrangement of the alkyl side chains resulting in a high degree of disorder. Notably, PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD shows an increased Lc value (Lc = 3.92 nm, 1.18 nm) and decreased d010, demonstrating that the introduction of the linear alkylthio-side chain at the BDT unit can enhance the crystallinity and the π–π stacking. However, the diffraction features of both the (100) and (010) domains in donor films are far less intense relative to the acceptors, indicating that the donors have predominantly amorphous characteristics.

All the acceptor pristine films showed well-defined scattering features indicating a semi-crystalline morphology consistent with previous reports.19,36 The corresponding π–π stacking distance was 4.12 Å, 4.11 Å and 4.08 Å for P(NDI2OD-T), P(NDI2OD-Se) and P(NDI2HD-Se), respectively. Meanwhile, the lamellar stacking distance was also calculated to be 21.52 Å, 21.10 Å and 20.00 Å for the above mentioned polymers, which was in accordance with the size of polymer side-chains and backbone planarity. In addition, the coherence length (Lc) of the crystalline domains is calculated to evaluate these acceptors’ crystallization. As shown in Table S3 (ESI†), the Lc values of the lamellar stacking peaks exhibit the following order: P(NDI2HD-Se) (9.94 nm) > P(NDI2OD-Se) (9.23 nm) > P(NDI2OD-T) (6.92 nm). Similarly, the Lc values of π–π stacking peaks show the same order: P(NDI2HD-Se) (1.54 nm) > P(NDI2OD-Se) (1.43 nm) > P(NDI2OD-T) (1.28 nm). The comparison results reveal that selenophene-based polymers with a shorter side chain exhibit a more ordered structure in films than thiophene-based polymers.
When blending PBDT(T)-HT-TPD or PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD with acceptors, strong lamellar stacking and π–π stacking peaks were still observed in all blend films, suggesting that the donor and the acceptor in the blend tended to have a strong preferential orientation, which mostly retained their same packing orientation with the corresponding pristine polymers. Meanwhile, all blends showed reduced Lc values and diffraction intensity compared to neat acceptors. This reveals that the molecular ordering of acceptors can be significantly suppressed by blending disordered donors, while there is a marginal effect on donors. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table S3 (ESI†), in comparison with the PBDT(T)-HT-TPD/P(NDI2OD-Se) or PBDT(T)-HT-TPD/P(NDI2HD-Se) blend, PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD-based blends have a relatively smaller Lc value and larger stacking distances, which illustrates that PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD-based blends have a higher degree of disordered fraction. However, the PBDT(T)TPD/P(NDI2OD-Se) blend shows the largest Lc, indicating that PBDT(T)TPD has no suitable miscibility with P(NDI2OD-Se), which cannot suppress the excessive aggregation of highly crystalline acceptors. As well known, the oversized segregated domains and a high degree of disordered fraction may have negative effects on charge transport properties.46 These may be the reason for the high Jsc and μe(μh) values of the devices based on PBDT(T)-HT-TPD/P(NDI2HD-Se) or PBDT(T)-HT-TPD/P(NDI2OD-Se).
Finally, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to obtain insight into the blend film morphology (Fig. 5 and Fig. S9, ESI†). It is well known that a bi-continuous interpenetrating network in all-PSCs is necessary for the transport of holes and electrons.47 In all images, all blend films show relatively smooth surfaces with a root mean square roughness (RMS) in the range of 0.67–0.89 nm and uniform morphology with no significant phase separations observed. As shown in Fig. 5c, the PBDT(T)-HT-TPD/P(NDI2HD-Se) blend film presents finer domain sizes with tiny fiber-like features and a better interconnected donor/acceptor network structure, indicating a well maintained P(NDI2HD-Se) network inside PBDT(T)-HT-TPD which is beneficial for carrier separation and transport. In contrast, the PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD-based blend films exhibit a less well-developed network and ordered structure, which shows their relatively high degree of disorder fraction. PBDT(T)TPD-based blend films (in our previous work) exhibited more segregated domains, which showed their poor miscibility. These findings may explain why PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD and PBDT(T)TPD based devices show relatively low Jsc and FF. This infers that appropriately decreasing the crystallinity can promote the amorphous donor to penetrate the highly crystalline acceptor to form interpenetrating network structures with more appropriate domain and phase separation. Therefore, the weakly crystalline donor PBDT(T)-HT-TPD and the semi-crystalline acceptor P(NDI2HD-Se) have well-balanced crystallinity/miscibility, which reveals that the well controlled crystallinity/miscibility balance between the donor and acceptor may be a decisive factor for high device performance.

The storage lifetime and stability of solar cells under thermal stress are important for practical applications. In order to explore the effect of the alkyl-thiophene π-bridge on stability, the devices based on PBDT(T)-HT-TPD/P(NDI2HD-Se) were tested, and the reference devices based on PBDT(T)TPD/P(NDI2HD-Se) were fabricated to make a comparison. All the test samples were stored in a N2 filled glove-box and the device performances were monitored at regular intervals in an ambient environment at room temperature.
We first investigated the storage stability of PBDT(T)-HT-TPD/P(NDI2HD-Se), PBDT(T)TPD/P(NDI2HD-Se) in an N2 filled glove-box without encapsulation. The measurements were performed at regular intervals over the course of 50 days. As shown in Fig. 6, after an initial large drop in performance within the first 200 h, and 78% of initial performance after 1200 h aging, the damping of PCE should be ascribed to the degradation of the conventional device architecture and the oxidation of the aluminum electrode. PBDT(T)TPD/P(NDI2HD-Se) retains 74% of the initial performance during the same aging period. In short, without annealing, PBDT(T)-HT-TPD-based devices show a relatively stable performance.
 Fig. 6  The (a) storage stability and (b) stability under thermal stress (100 °C). 
Secondly, we investigated the stability of the devices under thermal stress. The BHJ active layers were spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer, and the films were then heated for different times on a hot plate at 100 °C in an N2 filled glove-box prior to the deposition of the Al top electrode to exclude the influence of other factors on the device performance during thermal annealing, such as oxidation of aluminum.33 The measurements were taken at regular intervals over the course of 72 h. As shown in Fig. 6(b), PBDT(T)-HT-TPD-based devices exhibit excellent stability under continuous heating with slight PCE degradation (92% of the initial value) after 70 h thermal treatment, although DIO and PEDOT:PSS exert a negative impact for long time thermal stress. The obvious decay in PCE occurred during the initial 10 h, and then remained stable. In contrast, the PCE of PBDT(T)TPD-based devices dropped to 83% after the same aging. The stability test indicates that PBDT(T)-HT-TPD-based devices have better stability than PBDT(T)TPD-based devices. Therefore, it was concluded that the introduction of the alkyl-thiophene π-bridge could distort the main chain leading to an increase in the amorphous region, and thus providing an enhancement in the miscibility and morphology stability of the PBDT(T)-HT-TPD/P(NDI2HD-Se) blend.
Conclusion
In summary, we investigated the synergetic effect of an alkyl-thiophene π-bridge and side chain modification on the performance of the devices composed of donors PBDT-TPDs (based on 2D-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]dithiophene (BDT) and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD)) and acceptors PNDI-Ts(PNDI-Se) (based on naphthalene diimide (NDI) and thiophene (or selenophene)). By incorporating the alkyl-thiophene π-bridge, PBDT(T)-HT-TPD with decreased crystallinity shows a broad and blue-shifted absorption, which has a good complementary absorption and miscibility with narrow band-gap polymer acceptors leading to enhanced device performances. Nevertheless, tuning the side chain from branched alkyl- to linear alkylthio- has no positive effects on the PBDT(ST)-HT-TPD-based device performance due to the poor miscibility/crystallinity balance in BHJ. PBDT(T)-HT-TPD/P(NDI2HD-Se) based devices show the best device performance with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 12.52 mA cm−2, an FF of 58.7%, and a corresponding PCE of 6.80%, while they exhibit excellent thermal-stability. It is noted that this high PCE was obtained using a simple spin-coating process without extra treatment and a buffer layer, which was helpful for the fabrication of large area flexible PSCs. As a result, it was concluded that the introduction of alkyl-thiophene could distort the main chain leading to an increase in the amorphous region, and thus providing an enhancement in the miscibility and morphology stability of the PBDT(T)-HT-TPD/P(NDI2HD-Se) blend. Our work may propose a more universal and facile method to tailor exiting prominent p-type/n-type polymers for the development of a new ideal donor/acceptor combination to achieve improved performance in all-polymer photovoltaic devices.

Measurements and characterization
The 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a BRUKER AVIII-400 NMR spectrometer by utilizing deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the standard. Number-average (Mn) and weight-average (Mw) molecular weights were determined using Waters 1515 gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis with THF as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Mettler-Toledo 851e/822e analysis system under N2 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was carried out using a METTLER TOLEDO differential scanning calorimeter DSC 822e, from 0 °C to 300 °C at a heating and cooling rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2 flow. Mass data were obtained using a Bruker Microflex MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer. Elemental analysis data were collected using an Elementar Vario EL Cube. Cyclic voltammetric (CV) measurements were carried out in a conventional three-electrode cell using a platinum plate as the working electrode, a platinum wire as the counter electrode, and a Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode on a Zahner IM6e Electrochemical Workstation in a tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) (0.1 M) acetonitrile solution at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. The experiments were calibrated with the standard ferrocene/ferrocenium (FOC) redox system and it was assumed that the energy level of FOC was 4.8 eV below vacuum, and the value of 0.55 V was found for FOC vs. Ag/AgCl. The energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the levels of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the polymers were calculated using the following equations: EHOMO = −e(Eonsetox + 4.25) V and ELUMO = −e(Eonsetred +4.25) V, respectively. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a SHIMADZU UV-2600 spectrometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected using an X’pert3 and Empyrean (Netherlands Panalytical) with Cu Ka radiation. The sample films were prepared by spin-coating of the polymer chloroform (CHCl3) solution onto glass and dried. The photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a SHIMADZU RF-5301PC. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a NanoMan VS microscope in the tapping mode. The sample films were prepared under optimal conditions for device fabrication.
Fabrication of devices and characterization
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated in a typical sandwich structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:acceptor/Al. ITO-coated glass substrates (15 Ω cm−2) were cleaned by ultra-sonication sequentially in detergent, distilled water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol and then treated with an O2-plasma. After drying the substrates, PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP A1 4083) was spin-coated (3500 rpm for 30 s) on ITO glass and then dried at 150 °C for 15 min on a hot plate in air. Then, the substrates were transferred to a N2-filled glove box. Polymer blends were dissolved in chloroform with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) under optimization conditions and the solutions were spin-coated on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate. Afterwards, the counter electrode of Al (150 nm) was successively deposited under high vacuum onto the active layer inside a nitrogen glove box. The active areas of the cells between the cathode and anode were 4 mm2. Current–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded in air, using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under 100 mW cm−2 illumination simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) values of the solar cells were measured using Enlitech QE-R3011 at room temperature in air.
Charge carrier mobility measurement
The hole mobility was measured in a hole-only device composed of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The electron mobility was measured in an electron-only device composed of ITO/PFN/active layer/LiF/Al. For the hole-only devices, blends were dissolved in chloroform with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) under optimization conditions and the solutions were spin-coated on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate. After this, MoO3 (15 nm) and Ag (80 nm) were successively deposited under high vacuum onto the active layer inside a nitrogen glove box. For the electron-only devices, blends were dissolved in chloroform with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) under optimization conditions and the solutions were spin-coated on the ITO/PFN substrate, and then, LiF (1 nm) and Al (120 nm) were successively deposited under high vacuum onto the active layer inside a nitrogen glove box. The hole and electron mobilities were determined by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The data were analyzed by fitting of the dark current–voltage curves to the equation, J = 9/8εε0μV2/L3, where J is the current, μ is the charge mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, ε is the relative dielectric constant of the active layer, L is the thickness of the active layer, and V is the effective voltage (V = Vapplied − Vbi − Vr), where Vapplied is the applied voltage, Vbi is the built-in voltage and Vr is the voltage drop.
