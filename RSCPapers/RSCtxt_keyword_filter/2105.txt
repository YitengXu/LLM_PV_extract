    , Accepted 9th August 2019First published on 12th August 2019AbstractIn inverted perovskite solar cells, poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) are traditional hole transport materials. In such cells, functional improvement is becoming harder to achieve for the device. However, in this study, a novel process was found to be effective using the argon-plasma treatment, in which the ion cluster was used to scour the PEDOT:PSS surface instead of the traditional bombardment method. By an ideal plasma-generation power and treatment time (1800 J), the largest photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device of PED (PEDOT:PSS surface being parallel to the plasma-generation electric field direction) reaches 14.8% with an improvement of 23.3% compared to the VED (vertical to the plasma electric field direction) device whose PCE is 13.31%, while the PCE of the reference is 12.0%. As per the physical mechanism, both PED and VED treatment can increase the surface free energy and roughness to result in a suitable hydrophilicity and larger grain size of the perovskite film. With the change in the ratio of PEDOT and PSS by the plasma treatment, the conductivity of the film also increases observably. Furthermore, since PED has the furrowing effect on the PEDOT:PSS surface, the ordered crystallization leads to perovskite films with few pinholes, and improves the abovementioned properties better than VED.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have become one of the most promising photoelectric conversion devices today, attracting the attention of numerous researchers. Perovskite materials are also used in other fields, such as photodetection.1–3 The photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has increased from 3% to more than 23.2% in recent years.4–10 A PSC is an organic–inorganic hybrid semiconductor device that is divided into n-i-p and p-i-n structures according to the position of the hole- and electron-transport layers in the cell. An inverted PSC can be fabricated by a simple manufacturing process and is compatible with flexible solar cells, and its PCE has reached 21%.11 However, for perovskite solar cells with CH3NH3PbI3−xClx as the absorption layer, the efficiency is not so high and further research is needed.12,13
There are many ways to improve the device performance, such as the use of nanoimprint lithography to produce a perovskite layer14 and different methods of processing other layers. This work mainly deals with the hole-transport layer. There are many hole materials reported so far.15–19 However, inverted PSCs mainly employ PEDOT:PSS as the hole-transport layer as it has good conductivity and high transparency.20 However, the energy levels of PEDOT:PSS and the perovskite cannot be perfectly matched, resulting in a low open-circuit voltage of inverted PSCs and limiting the improvement of the PCE.21 The reason for the limitation of the PCE is not only the energy-level mismatch of PEDOT:PSS, but also the poor interface contact between the hole-transport and perovskite layers.10 Therefore, contact optimization is one of the key factors to improve the PCE of inverted PSCs.
In response to the above problems, researchers have used ultraviolet and ozone pre-treatment to improve the non-wetting hole-transport layer, which enables the perovskite film to achieve complete coverage.22 Wang et al. introduced a layer of graphene oxide as a modifying layer on the hole-transport layer, which was beneficial for enhancing the wettability of the hole-transport layer and improving the short-circuit current.23 To enhance the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS layer, Schrader et al. added sorbitol to PEDOT:PSS for increasing the cluster area of the conductive particles comprising PEDOT,24 taking advantage of the fact that an increase in the conductivity can result in an increase in the interface charge collection rate. Plasma is a state of matter in which an ionized gaseous substance becomes highly electrically conductive to the point that long-range electric and magnetic fields dominate the behavior of the matter.25 Some research groups have used plasma to improve the interface property of the electron- and hole-transport layers.26–30 Regarding the electron-transport layer, Rankin et al. treated a TiO2 layer with N and Ar plasma to increase the visible-light absorption, thereby increasing the photocurrent. They concluded that the band gap of TiO2 was changed by incorporating N.31 Huang et al. used Ar plasma to treat the perovskite layer of a PSC by adjusting the composition of the perovskite surface, reducing the defects of the perovskite layer and improving the efficiency of the PSC.32 For the hole-transport layer, the wettability and conductivity are important factors for improving the performance of PSCs, and they can also be changed by plasma treatment.33,34 Oxygen plasma was used to treat non-wetting hole-transport layers of P3HT, PTAA, PCDTBT, P3OT, and others, so that their surfaces can be oxidized to improve their hydrophilicity.35
For a PEDOT:PSS solution, the PSS content provides hydrophilicity, while PEDOT benefits the conductivity of the layer.36 By treating a PEDOT:PSS layer using Ar plasma, Xiong et al. obtained good results in terms of the improvement of the cell performance. They found that the etching effect removed the surface component PSS excess, and, therefore, the surface morphology, roughness, and free energy were improved, enhancing the conductivity and hydrophilicity, which caused an increase in the PCE.37 However, they did not elaborate on the effect of plasma treatment on the crystallization of the perovskite film, nor did they explore the effect of plasma power. Furthermore, their work used conventional plasma bombardment to treat the hole-transport layer, i.e., the ions directly impacted the surface of the film. The disadvantages of this treatment are that the vertical electrical field direction (VED) will cause an uneven film bombardment in a short period of time and will easily result in overtreatment at long treatment times.
To avoid the above-mentioned problems, a novel method using plasma in the treatment of a PEDOT:PSS film is proposed here. In this work, we attempted to place the film two ways: one parallel to the plasma electric field direction (PED), and the other vertical to it (VED), which is also known as conventional plasma bombardment. Compared with VED, PED may leave grooves on the surface of the PEDOT:PSS film, which not only produces uniform conductivity and better wettability, but also induces the orderly growth of perovskite to produce large grains and less voids in the film. Our experimental results indicated that PED indeed improved the quality of the perovskite film, resulting in a significant increase in the device efficiency.
Results and discussion
A schematic of a PEDOT:PSS hole-transport layer treated with Ar plasma is shown in Fig. 1(a) (left image shows PED treatment and right image shows VED treatment). During PED processing, the high-power ions move along the surface of the film to scour out traces. The formation of cannelures, which lay the foundation for ordering the grains of the next layer of film, is possible. For VED treatment, the plasma bombards along the normal direction of the film surface and a dot-like mark can be formed, roughening the surface.

As shown in Fig. 1(b), we counted the correlations between the efficiency of the devices and the plasma energy (bombardment energy) obtained from the product of the bombarding power and time. The reference device was defined as that when the bombardment energy was zero. A mountain graph was plotted from the results of the statistical analysis. It was found that PCE increased with the increase in the energy in the lower-energy domain, regardless of whether PED or VED treatment was carried out. On the contrary, in the higher energy domain, the PCE of the devices decreased with the increase in the energy, demonstrating that the plasma treatment will damage the surface of the films (overtreatment) and adversely affect the device PCE regardless of whether high power or long time was used. As shown in Fig. 1, VED treatment was more effective at energies between 1200 and 2500 J, while PED treatment was more effective between 1500 and 4000 J. To avoid either overtreatment or undertreatment, whether PED or VED was used, 1800 J was chosen as the standard processing energy for this research.
To observe the surface morphology of the PEDOT:PSS films after plasma treatment, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were made and the results are shown in Fig. 2. It could be found that the untreated film had a relatively uniform morphology; the VED-treated film was hit by a vertical uneven plasma, which made the surface of the film rugged; a groove was formed after PED treatment, which contributed to the ordered crystallization of the perovskite film. The untreated reference film had a root-mean-square roughness (RMA) of 6.03 nm, while VED and PED gave RMAs of 11.10 and 12.7 nm, respectively. This indicated that the roughness of the film surface was greatly improved by plasma treatment.

As a hole-transport layer, the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film has an important impact on the device efficiency.38,39 After plasma bombardment of the surface, the increase in the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film is a key evaluation standard. The contribution to the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS layer is mainly from PEDOT, but PEDOT particles are usually surrounded by more PSS “shells.”24,33,40 The PEDOT content on the surface of the film was lower than the PSS content.41–43 Therefore, a proper removal of PSS on the surface is beneficial for improving the connectivity between the PEDOT:PSS particles, resulting in higher conductivity.44 When the plasma bombards the surface, the excess PSS on the surface is removed and the surface conductive PEDOT particles are exposed, which increases the conductivity. The results of the conductive-AFM (c-AFM) tests of the PEDOT:PSS film are shown in Fig. 3. By comparing Fig. 3(a)–(c), it can be seen that the conductivity of the plasma-treated film is better than that of the untreated one. At the same time, the conductive uniformity of PED is better than that of VED because the plasma moves along the parallel direction of the film and a cannelure-like morphology is formed during the PED process. In particular, the treatment not only washes the surface of the film, but also removes the PSS in the cannelure, revealing more conductive PEDOT particles.

The good conductivity of PEDOT:PSS film was not only confirmed by its morphology using c-AFM, but also evaluated quantitatively using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 3(d)–(f), the analysis of elemental composition indicated that the SO32− contained in the PSS causes a strong peak at 168 eV in the S 2p spectrum, while the S element of PEDOT causes two self-spiral-split bimodal peaks at 163.9 and 165.3 eV.45,46 The peak intensity ratio between PEDOT and PSS is recorded as RT/S, which was large, indicating that the conductivity was good.37,44 The results showed that the RT/S value of the untreated film was 0.12, and were 0.20 and 0.23 for the VED and PED treatments, respectively, demonstrating that plasma treatment reduces the surface insulation component PSS, i.e., it can enhance the conductivity of the film. Simultaneously, PED may form grooves that induce an ordered crystallization of the perovskite molecules to produce very-high-quality perovskite films.
The ordered perovskite crystallization was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the resulting graphs are shown in Fig. 4(a)–(c). By comparing the crystalline particles of the perovskite, it could be found that PED and VED could significantly make the crystalline particles larger, and the perovskite films exhibited fewer voids. This is because the surface roughness of the PEDOT:PSS film increases after the plasma treatment and its wettability is enhanced. In other words, the more improved the wettability, the better the hydrophilicity of the film surface. According to the results of contact-angle tests on the films, shown in Fig. 4(a and c), the angle of the untreated film was 46.1°, and 37.6° and 31.2° for VED and PED, respectively. A decrease in the contact angle indicates an increase in the surface free energy,47 which promotes the liquid to infiltrate and diffuse more easily on the surface. The groove effect of PED causes a uniform infiltration of the perovskite precursor solution, which is favorable for forming large granular crystals of the perovskite.

Fig. 4(d)–(f) present the statistical data of the crystal grain diameters corresponding to the untreated, VED-, and PED-processed perovskite films, respectively. The results reveal that the perovskite grain diameter in the untreated films barely exceeded 0.6 μm. However, after VED and PED treatment, the proportion of large crystal grains in the perovskite film was significantly larger.
XRD tests also proved the large-grain crystallization result [see Fig. 5(a)], in which the crystal strength of the perovskite increased after both VED and PED treatment. Fig. 5(b) shows the ultraviolet-visible-light absorption spectroscopy results for the perovskite films with and without plasma treatment, where, due to the good crystallization quality of the perovskite, the plasma-treated hole-transport layer promotes the light absorption of the perovskite films.

Fig. 6(a)–(c) show the two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GXRD) profiles of the untreated, VED-, and PED-treated perovskite films, respectively, in which the two bright rings represent the 110 and 220 crystal planes of the perovskite grain at qz = 10 and 20 nm−1, respectively.48 It can be seen from the figures that the larger chromaticity coordinates of the two rings of the VED and PED treatment indicate that the orientations of the treated perovskite crystals were better than that of the reference film. Fig. 6(d) presents the radially integrated intensity plots along the ring of the perovskite 110 plane at qz = 10 nm−1; the diffraction peak appearing at 90° indicates the strength of the in-plane preferred orientation.49,50 The data clearly display, relative to the untreated film, that the perovskite grains had a good in-plane preferred orientation after plasma treatment. At the same time, the in-plane orientation of the perovskite grains after VED treatment was slightly stronger than that after PED treatment. Owing to the PED treatment, the groove-like morphology resulted in the wall of the groove on the PEDOT:PSS being inclined. When the crystal grains of the perovskite grow, they will be inclined as well. These slanted grains affected the grain orientation of the PED-treated perovskite, which caused its in-plane orientation to be slightly worse than that of the VED-treated film.

Plasma treatment of the PEDOT:PSS films can improve the crystal formation of the perovskite films to contribute to the photovoltaic effect, which depends on the electronic property of the device. Therefore, it was necessary to evaluate the electronic properties, including the capacitance and voltage (C–V) and capacitance and frequency (C–F), the results of which are shown in Fig. 7. As shown in Fig. 7(a), with an increase in the voltage (applied electric field), the film was polarized, causing a rapid increase in the capacitance when the voltage reached 0.7 V. For the untreated device, the capacitance increases the fastest, followed by the VED process. According to Huang et al., when the film was polarized, ions easily migrated to the perovskite grain boundary.51 The larger grain size led to fewer grain boundaries, which makes the perovskite ion bond tightly and become difficult to fracture. For the untreated device, the rapid increase in the capacitance indicates that the probability of ion migration is high. However, the PED-treated film had large grain sizes, i.e., fewer grain boundaries, so ion migration in the PED-treated film was the weakest and the capacitance change was the slowest.

However, we were able to obtain the carrier density of the device through C–V tests, using the Mott–Schottky equation,52–54 (1)where q is the elemental charge, A is the Schottky contact area (0.0725 cm2), ND is the carrier density, and Vbi is the built-in electric field. Since the reciprocal of the square of the capacitance is linear with the voltage, ND can be obtained by the slope of the straight-line portion, as shown in Fig. 7(b). Table 1 records the carrier densities of the untreated, VED-, and PED-treated devices. From the data, one can find that the larger carrier densities of the VED- and PED-treated devices indicate the possibility of larger grain sizes and fewer grain boundaries.

To compare the polarization of the perovskite layer, we also measured the C–F of the devices. The carrier polarization of the device is characterized by the dielectric constant εr and the dielectric loss (δ), which are shown in Fig. 7(c) and (d), respectively. Here, εr is obtained by the formula C = εrε0A/d, where d = 300 nm.55,56 In the low-frequency stage, the dipole polarization tends to predominate. With an increase in the frequency (>104 Hz), εr decreases to a constant and the polarization is mainly induced by the space charge. The large polarization of the device treated by the plasma indicates that the carrier density is large and the corresponding dielectric loss is smaller. In particular, the effect of PED treatment was very significant. It also showed that plasma processing can obtain high-quality films, and moreover, that the devices fabricated using such films have better electrical properties than untreated devices. The C–F measurements reflect the polarization in the dielectric layer, and in addition, also reflect the trap density of states (tDOS) of the device,57–59 the exported data of which are shown in Fig. 8(a). These results demonstrate that the untreated devices had the highest tDOS, i.e., the number of traps was due to the small grain size and poor film quality. In particular, for the high-band (right-hand side of Fig. 8(a)) domain, the difference in tDOS caused by the polarization of the space charge shows the effect of the plasma-treated films.

(d) PCE stability tests of the PED, VED, and reference under N2 atmosphere. 
The improvement of both the PEDOT:PSS and perovskite films can finally be expressed by the J–V curve shown in Fig. 8(b). The efficiency obtained by PED treatment was the highest, reaching 14.8%, followed by that obtained by VED, 13.55%; the efficiency was only 12% for the reference cell. Among these, the increase in efficiency was mainly reflected in the increase in short-circuit current. After plasma treatment, the conductivity, hydrophilicity, and roughness were improved, which facilitate the formation of larger perovskite grains. Large grain size leads to a reduction in the number of grain boundaries, which helps reduce the recombination of carriers at the grain boundaries, increasing the charge-collection rate, which, in turn, ultimately increases the short-circuit current. PED processing not only has the aforementioned advantages, but also may create grooves at the PEDOT surface to form an ordered and less porous layer during the growth of the perovskite film. The incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectral measurements, displayed in Fig. 8(c), reflect the light absorption of the devices. The measurement results show that the PED-treated device had the highest external quantum efficiency (EQE), indicating that the processes of light absorption, exciton diffusion, and carrier transport were optimal, which were also derived from a good perovskite film. Stability is also one of the urgent problems that needs to be solved, and many studies have contributed to the improvement of stability.60–62 As shown in Fig. 7(d), it was found that the stability of VED and PED had no obvious difference.
Conclusions
After treating the PEDOT:PSS film with VED and PED separately, it could be concluded that the PEDOT:PSS film can adapt the energy range of the bombardment surface as follows: the energy range of PED treatment is 1500–4000 J and that of VED treatment is 1200–2500 J. Both exhibit the highest efficiency at 1800 J. Furthermore, both treatments are beneficial to the conductivity of the film, the improvement of wettability, and the increase in grain size. Since PED treatment may create grooves, not only is the surface of the film affected, but the grooves also penetrate into the film, resulting in more uniform conductivity and stronger wettability. The generation of grooves during PED treatment induces the growth of the perovskite grains and produces a film with large crystal grains and fewer pores, so that its efficiency is better than that obtained by VED treatment.

The PEDOT:PSS film was spin-coated on the ITO at 4500 rpm for 30 s. PbCl2:CH3NH3I was dissolved in DMF at a ratio of 1:3 and stirred at 60 °C for 12 h to synthesize a perovskite precursor solution, which was then spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS film at 4000 rpm for 40 s. The PCBM (20 mg mL−1) and Bphen were spin coated at 2000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, silver was slowly evaporated to 100 nm.
