    , Accepted 3rd December 2012First published on 4th December 2012AbstractWe present studies of the photoelectrochemical characteristics and interfacial charge transfer dynamics of two (4,4′-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene) BODIPY dyes (BODIPY-1 and 2) attached to nanostructured TiO2 electrodes. BODIPY-1 bears two carboxylic acid groups at its 2 and 6 positions and BODIPY-2 is modified with two cyanoacetic acid groups at these positions. Photoelectrochemistry measurements show that BODIPY-2 has better photostability and device short-circuit current density than BODIPY-1 because of its broader light absorption and efficient charge injection as shown by ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and steady-state photoelectrochemical studies. The more efficient photocurrent generation by BODIPY-2 is also attributed to the improved redox reaction kinetics with its hole transport media, I−/I3−, in comparison with BODIPY-1.
1. Introduction
Since the first dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) was invented by Michael Grätzel and Brain O'Regan in 1991,1 DSSCs have been attracting both academic and commercial interest. Electrical power is generated from a dye-sensitized solar cell in a process where the sunlight is harvested by a sensitizer adsorbed on the surface of a semiconductor, typically a nanocrystalline TiO2 film.2,3 Photoinduced charge injection from the sensitizer to TiO2 produces electron(s) which travel through the semiconductor network towards a transparent electrode to produce electrical work.1,4,5 In a dye-sensitized solar cell, the dye HOMO/LUMO gap as well as their positions relative to the TiO2 bands are important parameters that play a large role in determining the power efficiency of the cell.2,6 To be suitable for application in DSSCs, the dye must meet several requirements. First, it should be strongly bound to the semiconductor surface via its ligands for efficient charge injection to the conduction band of TiO2.7–9 Second, the dye should be stable enough to sustain 108 redox cycles under illumination to sustain a sufficient photocurrent density throughout its lifetime.10–12 Several thousands of dyes, including metal complexes, porphyrins, phthalocyanines, and metal-free organic dyes have been used in dye-sensitized solar cells,13 though ruthenium complexes14–19 bearing carboxylic acid groups are the most widely used sensitizers due to their high photostability, efficient charge injection to TiO2, and broad light absorption.
BODIPY (4,4′-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene) dyes have gained a great deal of attention recently because of their high extinction coefficients (>80000 cm−1 M−1), relative insensitivity to environmental perturbations, and resistance to photobleaching which are all desirable for practical applications.20–23 The covalent attachment of BODIPY dyes on TiO2 surfaces for use in dye-sensitized solar cells and their interfacial charge transfer dynamics have yet to be fully investigated. Here, we present the photoelectrochemical characteristics and interfacial charge transfer dynamics of two (4,4′-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene) BODIPY dye (BODIPY-1 and 2) monolayers self-assembled onto TiO2 electrodes. BODIPY-1 bears two carboxylic acid groups at its 2 and 6 positions and BODIPY-2 is modified with two cyanoacetic acid groups at these positions. BODIPY-2 is found to provide better solar cell performance than BODIPY-1 due to its more efficient redox kinetics with I−/I3− and because it forms higher density monolayers on TiO2 due to its more flexible linker moiety.
2. Experimental
The BODIPY-1 and 2 (cf.Fig. 1) dyes were synthesized by following the procedures described in the ESI.† Titanium(IV) isopropoxide (98%, Ti[OCH(CH3)2]4, Strem chemicals), monobasic sodium phosphate monohydrate (98+%, NaH2PO4·H2O, Acros), N,N-dimethylformamide (99.8%, DMF, Fisher scientific), and nitric acid (69.0–71.0%, Fisher scientific), hydroquinone (H2Q) (99+%, Sigma-Aldrich), polyethylene glycol (PEG, M-35000, Sigma-Aldrich), and absolute ethanol (200 proof, Pharmco-Aaper) were used as received without further purification. Indium-tin oxide (ITO, ∼25 Ω/□) glass was purchased from Colorado concept coating LLC.

Nanocrystalline TiO2 colloidal solutions were prepared via the hydrolysis of titanium isopropoxide according to the previous reports.24,25 Under a N2 environment, 25 mL of titanium isopropoxide was mixed with 4 mL of ethanol. The mixture was introduced dropwise into a bottle containing 150 mL of DI water (Millipore Elix, 18 MΩ cm) under vigorous stirring. 1 mL of concentrated nitric acid was then added to the hydrolysis mixture under vigorous stirring. The reaction was conducted for 8 h at 80 °C to yield a stable, transparent TiO2 colloidal solution. The solution was stored in the dark at room temperature until later use. 25 mL of the TiO2 colloidal solution was concentrated to about 5 mL by vacuum evaporation of water at room temperature. 0.3 g PEG was added into the concentrated TiO2 colloidal solution for spincoating. ITO glass was sequentially sonicated for 10 min twice in detergent, DI water, acetone, and isopropanol. After drying under a nitrogen stream, the ITO glass was treated with UV-O3 (UV/Ozone procleaner, Bioforce nanosciences) for 30 min. The concentrated TiO2 colloidal solution was then spincoated onto the cleaned ITO glass at 2000 rpm for 60 s prior to annealing at 450 °C for 30 min. The ITO/TiO2 substrates were immersed into a DMF solution (0.3 mM) of the BODIPY dyes for 4 h in the dark at room temperature and rinsed three times with DMF.
Absorption spectra were taken with a Varian Cary 50 UV-vis spectrophotometer using blank ITO glass as a reference. Fluorescence spectra were obtained on a Horiba Jobin Yvon FluoroMax-3 spectrofluorometer. Photocurrent time-dependence and action spectra of the ITO/TiO2/BODIPY electrodes were obtained using a home-built solar cell testing system comprised of a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter and a solar simulator with a power intensity of 100 mW cm−2 from a Newport 66902 Xenon Arc lamp modified with an Oriel air mass (AM) 1.5 spectral filter. The photocurrent response to the incident light wavelength (or action spectra) was taken with the addition of a spectrometer (MD 1000, Optical Building Blocks) to the setup. Transient absorption spectroscopy was performed with a 1 kHz amplified Ti:sapphire laser system (Clark MXR CPA-2010). The pump and probe beams came from splitting the 150 fs, 775 nm, fundamental output of the Ti:sapphire amplifier. Ninety-five percent of the 775 nm fundamental was doubled to create 387 nm pump pulses; while the other 5% was used for white light continuum probe pulses. A femtosecond transient absorption spectrometer (Ultrafast System Helios) was employed for data acquisition. All ensemble measurements were performed in a N2 purged optical cell to prevent photo-oxidation of the dyes.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Absorption and fluorescence spectra of BODIPY dyes and BODIPY-sensitized TiO2 electrodes

Fig. 1 shows the molecular structures and absorption and fluorescence spectra of BODIPY-1 and 2 in DMF with absorption maxima at 500 nm and 540 nm, respectively. Due to the electron withdrawing effect of the nitrile group, the absorption peak of BODIPY-2 is red-shifted about 40 nm in comparison with that of BODIPY-1. Both BODIPY dyes show quite low fluorescence quantum yields of less than 2.0% due to efficient photo-induced charge transfer from the electron-rich phenyl group at the meso position of the BODIPY dye to the HOMO level of its core. The alkyl groups were introduced to these two dyes to improve their solubility in DMF26,27 and to help direct preferential self-assembly of the dye onto the hydrophilic nanostructured TiO2 electrodes via their carboxylic acid groups at their 2 and 6 positions. BODIPY-2 is designed with a longer linker moiety in order to minimize steric hindrance to forming a monolayer on TiO2. This modification of BODIPY-2 is expected to provide more efficient interfacial charge transfer to TiO2 upon photo-excitation.
Equivalent concentrations of BODIPY-1 and 2 were used to modify nanostructured TiO2 electrodes for use in dye sensitized solar cells. Monolayers of the BODIPY dyes are obtained when the molecules are self-assembled on the oxide substrate via covalent interactions between their carboxylic acid groups and the TiO2 substrates. An extended self-assembling time of 4 h was used to allow sufficient surface attachment. Peak optical densities as high as 0.27 could be achieved for both BODIPY dyes as shown in the absorption spectra of the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes made possible by the high surface area of the TiO2 nanoparticles (cf.Fig. 2(a)). Significant spectral broadening can be observed on the TiO2 surface for both BODIPY dyes because of strong intra-molecular interactions. The absorption spectra of thin film ITO/TiO2/BODIPY samples are a combination of dye absorption and interference of the incident light near the regions of 580 nm, 380 nm and 480 nm. This interference wave can be eliminated by optimizing the TiO2 thickness and changing the refractive index of the film by varying the optical density of the dye to ensure enough light absorption by BODIPY 1 and 2 for solar energy conversion. SEM images of bare ITO electrode, TiO2 coated ITO and BODIPY dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes are shown in Fig. S1† of the ESI.

3.2 Photoelectrochemical characteristics of BODIPY-sensitized TiO2 electrodes
The action spectra for the BODIPY-sensitized TiO2 electrodes in I−/I3− are also shown in Fig. 2(a). The action spectra are normalized according to the peak at 335 nm, which is attributed to the photocurrent of the TiO2 electrode itself. The action spectra closely resemble the absorption spectra of the two BODIPY dyes in DMF solution with the maximum photocurrent density near 500 nm and 530 nm for BODIPY-1 and BODIPY-2, respectively, indicating the BODIPY dyes play the dominant role in the visible photocurrent response of the cells. It should be noted that the photocurrent conversion efficiency of the ITO/TiO2/BODIPY-2 electrode is higher than that of the ITO/TiO2/BODIPY-1 electrode. This can be explained by the broader light absorption of the BODIPY-2 dye (cf.Fig. 1 and 2(a)), as more photons can be absorbed and then converted to free charges at the dye–TiO2 interface. Also, as discussed previously, BODIPY-2 is expected to form denser monolayers on TiO2, as it has a longer conjugated linker moiety to minimize steric hindrance resulting in more light absorption. The visible light induced photocurrent response might be affected by the photocurrent generated from TiO2 because of possible charge back transfer to BODIPY dye when both UV and visible light sources are used. To better illustrate the visible light induced photocurrent generation capability of the BODIPY monolayers on TiO2, a 400 nm long-pass filter was used to reject all UV light when the action spectra were taken and represented using incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) (see Fig. 2(b)). The visible light response of BODIPY 1 and 2 show well-resolved photocurrent peaks that are consistent with their absorption spectra without being obscured by the UV light response of TiO2. The better IPCE response of BODIPY-2 is attributed to its broader light absorption and higher monolayer density for efficient charge transfer for photocurrent generation. Control experiments with various linker moieties at different modification positions on the BODIPY framework could help resolve the underlying interfacial charge transfer dynamics and back transfer rates involved in a dye-sensitized solar cell system.
To further explore their photocurrent generation performances, short-circuit photocurrent responses of the devices made with BODIPY-1 and 2 were recorded in response to excitation with the full solar spectrum (cf.Fig. 3). Current–voltage characteristics of the devices are shown in Fig. S2† of the ESI. Upon illumination, the current increases rapidly and reaches a maximum, then slowly decreases to a steady state. The current settles back to its original level when the incident light is switched off. Consistent with the action spectra in Fig. 2, the BODIPY-2 monolayer on TiO2 generates more than two fold higher photocurrent density under full solar spectrum excitation than BODIPY-1. In addition, the photocurrent density of the BODIPY-2 device reaches a steady state instantly upon excitation, while the photocurrent response of the BODIPY-1 device decays slowly over an extended period of time. This has to do with the sluggish mass transfer of iodide near the surface of BODIPY-1-modified TiO2 and/or slow charge transfer kinetics from I−/I3− to the BODIPY-1 dye. Upon rejecting all UV light from the solar simulator, it can be seen that the visible light photocurrent of the two BODIPY dyes contributes almost 50% of the overall photocurrent generated by the full spectrum of our solar simulator and the slow photocurrent decay remains for the BODIPY-1 cell. The photocurrent response relative to the dark current (Iphoto/Idark) under white light illumination for the ITO/TiO2/BODIPY-1 electrode are 35 and 10, in the absence and presence of a 400 nm long-pass filter, respectively, while the values are 153 and 91 for the ITO/TiO2/BODIPY-2 electrode as calculated from the time dependence curves shown in Fig. 3. The significant increase in its photocurrent response relative to the dark current for BODIPY-2 is not only due to its high photocurrent density, but also because of its lower leakage current.28,29 We can also conclude from this study that the slow decay in photocurrent is not due to the mass transfer of I−/I3− near the BODIPY-1-modified TiO2 surface. Instead, it has to do with the difference in the charge transfer kinetics of I−/I3− with the two BODIPY dyes. The steady-state photocurrent of the BODIPY-2 monolayer on TiO2 suggests fast charge transfer from iodide to the dye upon charge transfer to the conduction band of TiO2. Such efficient charge transfer rate constant between BIDIPY-2 and I− could be attributed to the more flexible linker moiety and attachment configuration of BODIPY-2 on the surface of TiO2, yielding sufficient interaction with iodide to allow efficient charge transfer in comparison with the rigid configuration of BODIPY-1.

Electrolyte: 0.05 M LiI and 0.05 M I2 in acetonitrile. 
To provide further evidence on the role played by the linker moieties of the two BODIPY dyes in their photocurrent stability, another redox pair, hydroquinone (H2Q) and benzoquinone (Q), was studied as their redox potential is 0.7 V more positive than iodide/tri-iodide and bear aromatic rings that may provide different reaction kinetics. As shown in Fig. 4, H2Q/Q has a redox potential of −4.8 V (vs. vacuum) more positive than I−/I3− (−5.4 V vs. vacuum) and should consequently have a much higher driving force to inject electrons into the HOMO level of the BODIPY dyes following photoinduced charge transfer to TiO2.30 Electrochemical redox potentials are shown in Fig. S3† of the ESI. We expect to observe less of an effect due to the linker molecule and steric hindrance in this case as the over potential provided by the large difference between the HOMO level of the BODIPY dye and the redox potential of H2Q/Q is high enough to provide efficient charge transfer to BODIPY dyes, therefore no photocurrent delay is expected to be observed. As shown in Fig. 5, we show the dark current and photocurrent of BODIPY-1 sensitized TiO2 solar cell under excitation of the full solar spectrum and the portion of visible light as we have shown earlier. Photocurrent from visible light (>400 nm) excitation has about 25% of the efficiency for cells containing I−/I3−. The lower photocurrent density of the cell has to do with the smaller mass transfer coefficient of H2Q and Q in contrast to I−/I3− and the irreversible oxidation of H2Q to Q in aqueous solution.31–33 The difference between the redox potential levels of Q/H2Q and the conduction band level of TiO2 is estimated to be around 0.35 eV from the photocurrent curve of the cell under UV-vis excitation as shown in Fig. 5a. The estimated conduction band level of TiO2 would be around −4.4eV or higher as shown in Fig. 4 by considering energy losses in photoinjection, traverse, and collection processes in the cell. The photocurrent response of the two BODIPY dyes in the presence of H2Q/Q are similar to each other, and no dramatic decay is observed due to the fast kinetics of charge transfer from H2Q to the BODIPY dyes in comparison with the I−/I3− redox pair.

3.3 Interfacial charge transfer kinetics obtained by ultrafast transient measurements
The above photoelectrochemical characterization indicates charge injection from BODIPY dyes to TiO2 takes place in an electrochemical environment. We expect that the charge transfer rates for both BODIPY dyes are high at open circuit potential in air. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy has been widely employed to investigate the kinetics of photoinduced processes occurring in electron donor/acceptor system.34–39 Here, transient absorption spectroscopy is used to investigate the ground state recovery rates and their differences for these two BODIPY dyes tethered to the surface of TiO2. Fig. 6 shows the first 50 ps transient absorption spectra and decay processes for BODIPY-1 and BODIPY-2, respectively, as monolayers on TiO2. The only prominent feature near 510 nm (cf.Fig. 6a for BODIPY-1) and 540 nm (cf.Fig. 6b for BODIPY-2) is due to their ground state bleach process. The decay of this peak was fitted to a double exponential for samples in DMF and a triple exponential for samples on TiO2 and cover glass; the results are given in Table 1. The ground state recovery rate of BODIPY-2 in DMF is much faster than BODIPY-1, suggesting that the intramolecular charge recombination is more efficient for BODIPY-2. The need for triple exponential decays for the samples on glass and TiO2 substrates is attributed to the additional processes that are involved for dyes tethered on solid surfaces, which provide additional relaxation pathways not present for samples in DMF. These processes include forward and backward electron transfer between BODIPY dyes and TiO2, strong intermolecular interactions and other possible non-radiative decay processes in the absence of solvent. For both dyes, the observed ground state recovery rates are significantly faster on TiO2 compared to in DMF. The fast ground state recovery is attributed to enhanced non-radiative decay and relaxation process of excited states in the absence of solvent. Table 1 also shows the ground state recovery decay lifetime of the two BODIPY dyes on glass. If forward electron transfer from the BODIPY dyes to TiO2 is efficient and back electron transfer is not, a slower ground state recovery rate (or longer decay lifetime) is expected on TiO2 as compared to the glass. The only consistent difference in lifetimes is for τ2, which is longer for both BODIPY-1 and BODIPY-2 on TiO2. This might be due to the fact that the decay dynamics of bleached ground states were measured for thin films of the BODIPY dyes on glass, while the ones on TiO2 were measured for a monolayer of dyes self-assembled onto the oxide substrate. The issue could be overcome by preparing a monolayer of BODIPY dyes on silica and comparing the ground recovery rates with the monolayers on TiO2. This, combined with the significant lifetime difference in DMF, makes it difficult to draw conclusions about their relative charge transfer rates/efficiency without a detailed kinetic model. Also of interest is that for the case of BODIPY-1 on TiO2, ΔA does not return to 0 at long delay times, but is actually positive. This implies the generation of persistent (within the experimental timeframe) species with a larger absorption cross section than the ground state molecule. This could be due to absorption of BODIPY-1+/TiO2− species present after charge transfer.

Conclusions
Two BODIPY dyes bearing different linker molecules were used to form sensitized solar cells on ITO/TiO2 electrodes. The action spectra and temporal photoresponse of the ITO/TiO2/BODIPY electrodes show that the BODIPY-2 dye has a better photostability and higher photocurrent than BODIPY-1 dye because of its fast charge transfer rate with the I−/I3− redox pair and broad light absorption on the surface of TiO2. The transient absorption studies confirmed that the ground state recovery following photoexcitation for both BODIPY dyes is slower on TiO2 as compared to glass substrates, which is attributed to interfacial charge transfer.
