    , Accepted 18th August 2019First published on 21st August 2019AbstractWhile organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells are emerging as promising candidates for next-generation solar cells with fascinating power conversion efficiency, the instability of perovskites remains a significant bottleneck for their commercialization. An atomic scale understanding of the degradation of hybrid perovskites, however, is only in its beginning stages because of the difficulty in preparing well-defined surface conditions for characterization. Using atomic force microscopy at ultra-high vacuum and room temperature, we report the first direct observation of the degradation process of a cleaved methylammonium lead bromide, MAPbBr3 (MA: CH3NH3+), single crystal. Upon in situ cleavage, atomic force microscopy images show large flat terraces with monolayer height steps, which correspond to the surface of cubic MAPbBr3 with methylammonium ligand termination. While this surface can be prepared via the cleavage process and is energetically stable, we observe that after several weeks under dark and vacuum conditions it degrades and produces clusters surrounded by pits. Guided by density functional theory calculations, we propose a degradation pathway that initiates even at low humidity levels and leads to the formation of surface PbBr2 species. We finally identify the electronic structure of the MA-bromine-terminated flat surface and find that it is correlated with a strong field-induced degradation of the MAPbBr3 only at positive sample bias voltages.
Introduction
Since first being suggested in 2009,1 organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, especially methylammonium lead halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3 or MAPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I), have received tremendous attention as light absorbers for solar cells. Laboratory-scale perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs) have already shown excellent power conversion efficiency, compared with conventional crystalline silicon-based solar cells.2–4 The practical application of PSCs, however, has been limited mainly because of the instability of the hybrid perovskites, and therefore the short lifetime of PSCs under operating conditions.5 Reports have shown that various factors may cause the degradation of perovskite materials,6 including moisture,7–9 oxygen,10,11 interaction with the electrode metal materials,12,13 light,14,15 and temperature.16,17 To date, many of the studies on the degradation of perovskites have focused on the scale of the device,18–24 making the degradation mechanisms a subject of ongoing debate. However, atomic-scale characterization of the degradation mechanisms of perovskites is quite challenging because of the difficulty in obtaining good model systems and surface-sensitive techniques with environmental control.
Most of the surface sensitive techniques require extremely controlled environments and sample conditions to investigate phenomena at the atomic scale. Therefore, studying the surface or the interface of highly ordered model systems has been a key strategy for elucidating the atomistic origins of the physical, chemical, and electronic properties of various materials.25–27 Despite the significant relevance in photovoltaic applications, however, the preparation and characterization of atomically clean and flat surfaces of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have been challenging because the perovskite films are mostly produced using solution-based methods.28,29 These crystal growth processes inherently involve exposure to air and/or solvents and therefore invite the presence of various surface contaminants. In this context, it is notable that a few groups, including us, have recently succeeded in preparing atomically clean MAPbBr3 and MAPbI3 surfaces in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber and examined the surfaces using scanning tunneling microscopy29,30 and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).31
In this work, using atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show the atomic-scale morphologies and degradation processes of in situ cleaved, clean MAPbBr3 single crystals under UHV conditions. Compared with its more standard MAPbI3 counterpart, it is simple to grow large single crystals for MAPbBr3 while attaining good photovoltaic properties32–35 and environmental stability.36 Moreover, while the tetragonal phase is the stable room-temperature crystal structure for MAPbI3, MAPbBr3 is stabilized in a cubic structure at room temperature, making it suitable for cleaving to prepare a flat and contaminant-free surface. To the best of our knowledge, despite the capability of simultaneously measuring the topography and conductance,37,38 conductive AFM (CAFM) has not been utilized to study the clean surface of MAPbBr3. Freshly cleaved MAPbBr3 initially exhibits a well-defined flat surface structure terminated by organic methylammonium ligands. However, over several weeks under dark and vacuum conditions, it undergoes deformation via dissociation and desorption of the organic ligands and forms PbBr2 clusters even in a UHV chamber, i.e. at low humidity. DFT calculations are carried out to characterize the stability of the MAPbBr3 surface and clarify the degradation pathways. The calculated electronic structure of the MAPbBr3 shows good agreement with the CAFM results.
Experimental and computational methods
Crystal growth
MAPbBr3 single crystals were grown using the inverse temperature crystallization method, which was adapted from the study by Saidaminov et al.39 1 M PbBr2 (Sigma Aldrich, 98%) and CH3NH3Br (Dyesol Ltd.) were dissolved in dimethylformamide (DMF) at room temperature (24 °C) and under ambient conditions. The solution was placed in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min to help dissolve the precursors. A PTFE filter (pore size of 0.22 μm) was then used to transfer 2.5 mL of the MAPbBr3 solution to new 5 mL glass vials. The vials with the filtered solution were placed in an oil bath at room temperature and heated to 90 °C (measured temperature of the oil bath) within 1 hour. After 6 hours, crystal growth was observed. For further growth, the temperature was increased to 100 °C. To obtain bigger crystals, the process was repeated with a seed crystal from the first growth step that was placed in the middle of a vial containing a new filtered solution.
To examine the structural and optical properties of the single crystal, we conducted X-ray diffraction (XRD) and photoluminescence (PL) measurements in ambient air at room temperature (see Fig. S1†). The XRD patterns were collected using a Rigaku D/Max2500 diffractometer with CuKα irradiation (40 kV, 300 mA) with a 0.01° step and at a scan rate of 4° min−1. The XRD patterns show (100), (200), (300) and (400) peaks; the sharp peaks reveal the high quality of the crystal. The PL measurements were performed using a Horiba LabRAM HR600 with a 325 nm excitation laser. The laser power was set to 1 μW so that it did not damage the sample (as seen under a microscope). A spectrometer with a 600 lines per mm grating and a CCD camera was used to collect the fluorescence of the MAPbBr3. We observed a strong emission at 540 nm (see Fig. S1(b)†).
Sample preparation and experimental setup
A MAPbBr3 single crystal is carved into a hat-like shape so that a washer can hold the bottom of the sample while the center protrudes through the washer hole. Single-crystal MAPbBr3 is mechanically cleaved in a load-lock vacuum chamber, where the base pressure is ≈1 × 10−7 mbar, using a surgical knife fixed to a single-axis manipulator in a manner similar to that reported by Ohmann et al.30 After cleavage, the sample is immediately transferred to an AFM chamber for measurements. The base pressure of the AFM chamber is 1 × 10−9 mbar.
We employed contact-mode AFM (RHK Beetle UHV-VT) to obtain topography, friction, and conductance images of the surface at UHV.40 All the AFM data presented here were obtained using a TiN-coated single-crystal silicone cantilever with a nominal spring constant of 0.03 N m−1. The radii of the tips were ≈10 nm, as provided by the manufacturer. To avoid possible tip damage, all the topography and friction images were obtained at virtually zero load, where the effective load equals the adhesion of the tip to the sample. Under such conditions, changes in the surface morphology up to five repeated scans remain under the measurement limit of the AFM. Based on load-dependent friction measurements not mentioned in this paper, we assume that the tip experiences a negligible change during subsequent contact measurements. In the conductance measurements, the bias voltage refers to the applied bias at the sample with respect to the grounded tip. To ensure stable electrical contact between the sample and the AFM system, conductive silver adhesive paste was applied to the back of the sample.
To provide a spectroscopic view of the degradation in the vacuum chamber, we carried out XPS measurements at the 10A2 beamline of the Pohang Light Source (PLS-II) in Korea. The selected photon energies are 240–450 eV for Pb 4f and 636–880 eV for O 1s. The intensities of the core level peaks presented herein are normalized by the flux measured at the entrance of the X-ray beam and the photoionization cross-section.41
Computational details and model structures
We carried out DFT calculations using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package42 within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof revised for solids (PBEsol).43 To crosscheck the reliability of the computational results, we performed additional calculations by including the effects of weak van der Waals interactions within the DFT-D3 method.44 The core and valence electrons were handled by the projector augmented wave method.45 Plane-waves were expanded with a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV to obtain basis sets. A self-consistent cycle energy criterion of 10−4 eV was adopted. Atomic structures were optimized using the conjugate-gradient approach until the Hellmann–Feynman forces were less than 0.025 eV Å−1. While calculating the projected density of states (DOS), we included the spin–orbit coupling effect.
We prepared various surface termination models by adopting a 2 × 2 MAPbBr3 (001) supercell and constructing a 20–40 Å thick MAPbBr3 slab composed of 4–6 PbI6 octahedral layers, where the topmost layer in some surface terminations, such as the PbBr2 model, could be half-octahedra (Fig. S2†). To avoid the development of artificial net dipole moments along the surface-normal direction, we systematically adjusted the orientations of the ligands layer by layer. Then, a vacuum space of more than 15 Å was inserted along the surface-normal direction to avoid interactions with neighboring images in the periodic boundary condition setup, and a k-point mesh of 5 × 5 × 1 was sampled in the Brillouin zone. Experimentally, the MAPbBr3 perovskite has a cubic structure (Pm3m) at room temperature with a 5.90 Å lattice parameter.46 The optimized lattice parameters for the bulk and slab models within our PBEsol and DFT-D3 calculations were comparable to the experimental value (Table S1†). More computational details are provided in ref. 47 and the ESI.†
Results and discussion
An atomically clean MAPbBr3 surface was prepared by cleaving a single crystal in a load-lock vacuum chamber. The sample was then immediately transferred to the AFM chamber for measurements. As shown in Fig. 1(a), we observed that shortly after cleavage, the MAPbBr3 surface morphology generally exhibits large (>300 nm) homogeneous terraces (for larger images, see Fig. S3†). Up to the accuracy of the equipment, we did not observe a notable sign of contamination of the freshly cleaved surface. In the top terrace in Fig. 1(a), we observe 90° angles at the corners of the step edges, which are compatible with the two-fold symmetry of the cubic phase of MAPbBr3. Fig. 1(b) shows the height profile over the multiple steps shown in Fig. 1(a). It exhibits a homogeneous step height of 6.0 ± 0.6 Å, which we designate as a single-layer step.46 Considering the lateral symmetry and consistent step height of the cleaved MAPbBr3 single crystal, we can conclude that we observed a stable cubic structure for the MAPbBr3 with minimal bulk contamination. To characterize the observed single-layer MAPbBr3 step surface structure, we carried out DFT calculations and found that it is consistent with the MA-bromine-terminated flat surface (labeled as ‘MABr-flat’) shown in Fig. 1(c) (step height of 0.61 nm; see also Fig. S2†).30 It should be emphasized that, rather than this MABr-flat surface, PbBr2-decorated vacant and PbBr2-terminated flat (labeled as ‘Vacant’ and ‘PbBr2-flat’, respectively) surface configurations shown in the insets of Fig. 1(d) are more relevant under typical growth conditions, as will be discussed in detail below together with the degradation process of the MABr-flat surface.

We observed the degradation of the MAPbBr3 surface over a period of weeks under UHV and dark conditions at room temperature. Fig. 2(a) and (b) exemplify the surface morphologies of MAPbBr3 after 7 and 22 days, respectively. We were unable to scan the same area after the weeks between measurements because of scanner drift. Nevertheless, the images shown in the paper are quite representative, and we observed similar trends in the degradation features in several areas of the sample. During storage, the sample was isolated from light sources except for a dim light from an ion gauge filament and occasional exposure to the deflection laser during AFM measurements. Compared with the fresh surface morphology shown in Fig. 1(a), a few distinctive features are observed after degradation in the UHV chamber: (1) the increased number and (2) size of the degraded clusters, and (3) the absence of single-layer height steps. We always observed the formation of a pit adjacent to the degraded clusters (indicated by the dotted yellow line in Fig. 2(b)). In Fig. 2(b), the depth of the pits ranges from a few nanometers up to approximately 10 nm. It is worth noting that the volume of the clusters appearing in the AFM topography images roughly matches the volume of the pit around each corresponding cluster within an order of magnitude, suggesting the formation of the clusters by agglomeration of adjacent surface layers during the degradation process. Fig. 2(c) shows the exponentially increasing average coverage (volume per unit area) of the clusters with respect to time in the UHV chamber, as obtained from the AFM topography images. The trend extends over several weeks. We found a clue as to the composition of the degraded clusters from their shape. Fig. 2(d) shows an example of a cluster showing clear edge angles of 120 degrees. The hexagonal symmetry of the clusters suggests the formation of crystalline PbBr2 clusters.48

Based on the DFT calculation results, we now discuss the stability of the representative MAPbBr3 surfaces in detail, and further suggest plausible degradation pathways for the cleaved MABr-flat surface, as summarized in Fig. 3. In terms of the energetics, we calculated the surface formation energies and found that the MABr-flat surface has a stable morphology with a surface formation energy of −39.9 meV Å−2 (−29.3 meV Å−2) within the PBEsol43 (DFT-D3 (ref. 44)) exchange–correlation functional level (see the ESI† for computational details).
 Fig. 3  Proposed degradation pathway for the MAPbBr3 single crystal in the UHV chamber in the presence of water vapor. The Vacant and Vacant′ surfaces have similar morphologies with the difference of just one PbBr2 molecule in the topmost atomic layer. 
Including the other stable Vacant and PbBr2-flat surfaces, the stability order turns out to be MABr-flat > Vacant > PbBr2-flat surfaces (see Table S2† for details). Analyzing the atomic origins of the stability of the MABr-flat and Vacant surfaces, we found that the rotation and relocation of organic ligands near the surface play a key role, as discussed for the MAPbI3 case29,49,50 (for further details, see Fig. S4†). In spite of its energetic stability, it should be noted that the MABr-flat surface is less likely to be available under typical growth conditions because of the volatile nature of MABr. For the MAPbI3 perovskite counterpart, the presence of PbI2 at the grain boundaries after thermal annealing was understood in terms of the higher volatility of MAI compared with PbI2.51 Accordingly, theoretical studies often did not consider the MA-iodine-terminated flat surface.52,53 To quantify the thermodynamic relevance of the MABr-flat surface in comparison with other probable Vacant and PbBr2-flat surfaces, we calculated their grand potentials52,54 and the results are summarized in Fig. 1(d) as a phase diagram (for the computational details, see the ESI and Table S3†). We indeed find that the Vacant and PbBr2-flat terminations are the probable MAPbBr3 surface morphologies under typical thermodynamic conditions, while the MABr-flat termination becomes the dominant surface only under extremely Pb-poor and Br-poor conditions.
Based on its relevance in the freshly cleaved MAPbBr3 samples, we now consider the degradation cycle that begins with the MABr-flat surface configuration (Fig. 3). Desorption of methylamine (CH3NH2) is likely the first degradation step, but DFT calculations show a high desorption energy of +2.33 eV (see the ESI and Table S4† for the DFT desorption energy values for the different molecules). This suggests that degradation of the MABr-flat surface should not readily occur in a perfect vacuum, i.e. under dry conditions, which is consistent with previous theoretical55 and experimental56 reports. Instead, as discussed in previous theoretical studies, the CH3NH2 desorbs favorably in the presence of hydroxyl radicals (OH) and hydroxide ions (OH−) on the MAPbBr3 surface.49,55 In our UHV experiments, ≈8 × 10−10 Torr of water was present in the vacuum chamber, which corresponds to ≈90 L per day (L = Langmuir), as measured using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (see Fig. S5†). Considering that a hot ion pressure gauge, a cold cathode pressure gauge, and an ionization pump were constantly operating during the storage of the sample in the vacuum chamber, we expect the formation and exposure of hydroxyl radicals by dissociation of the residual water in the system.57 After CH3NH2 desorption, excess Br2/Br− desorbs. The excess proton from the water dissociation can then together form HBr, which explains previous experimental reports.15,31 Since the proposed degradation pathway given in Fig. 3 releases H2O as a product, degradation of the MAPbBr3 surface would increase the partial pressure of water in the system, further accelerating the degradation process.
The synchrotron-based XPS results are shown in Fig. S6:† (a) Pb 4f and (b) O 1s peaks from UHV-cleaved MAPbBr3 and after 10−6 mbar of water exposure for 60 minutes, i.e. 3600 L, and (c) the corresponding O 1s/Pb 4f ratio from (a) and (b). The incident X-ray energy is chosen so as to enhance surface sensitivity. We observed that the Pb 4f intensity did not change after exposure to water vapor up to 3600 L (Fig. S6(a)†). Fig. S6(b)† shows O 1s spectra of freshly cleaved MAPbBr3 (red) and after water exposure (blue). No oxygen peak is observed for the freshly cleaved sample, which indicates a clean perovskite surface after UHV cleavage. After exposure to 3600 L of water, the O 1s intensity increases, indicating that the water (and hydroxyl) species are responsible for the degradation of the MAPbBr3 single crystal. An increase in the oxygen species in the perovskite is clearly shown in the O 1s/Pb 4f intensity ratio (see Fig. S6(c)†).
Desorption of CH3NH2 and H2O leads to an unstable Br-terminated surface with a very high surface energy (142.1 meV Å−2). Thus, bromine (Br2/Br−) will immediately desorb from the surface with a small desorption energy of +0.11 eV, which results in a PbBr2-flat surface. The surface deforms further (under PbBr2-poor conditions) to its more stable Vacant counterpart with an energy cost of +0.10 eV for the dissociation of the PbBr2 species. The dissociated PbBr2 would then agglomerate at the surface, explaining the growth of large hexagonal-shaped clusters and the formation of the adjacent pits observed in Fig. 2(b) and (d).
We finally explore the electronic structure of the MAPbBr3 surface and its correlation with degradation. Fig. 4(a) shows the topography (top) and current (bottom) images of a fresh MABr-terminated MAPbBr3 surface at various applied biases. Fig. 4(b) shows the averaged point current–voltage (I–V) spectroscopy results. The I–V characteristics of the surface in contact with the metallic TiN-coated tip exhibit a strong current signal at positive sample biases while almost no current signal is observed at negative sample biases. The measurement results were stable over multiple I–V measurements (see Fig. S7(a)†). However, after the AFM scans with a positive applied bias that produced strong current signals, we observed dramatic surface deformation (see Fig. 4(a) and S7(b)†). We emphasize that such a change is observed only at positive biases; when scanned at negative biases, we observe neither degradation nor a strong current signal in the conductance measurements at biases from 0 to −10 V. The correlation between current flow and surface deformation indicates that Joule heating and/or dissociative electron transfer processes could take place.58

Integrated local charge density around (d) the valence band maximum and (e) conduction band minimum exhibiting delocalized and localized carrier states, respectively. 
To gain a microscopic understanding of the I–V characteristics, we analyzed the electronic structure data obtained from DFT calculations. In Fig. 4(c) and S8,† we show the DOS data that exhibit band gap values of 0.94 and 1.02 eV for the MABr-flat and Vacant surfaces, respectively, after including the spin–orbit coupling effects to properly treat the heavy Pb atoms. Note that these values are underestimated at the GGA-level computations employed in this work,59 but for our purpose of understanding the nature of the transport, the GGA-level calculations are sufficient.60
It may be observed that, while it clearly indicates a p-type nature, the DOS curve is seemingly inconsistent with the experimental I–V curve that shows a complete suppression of current flow at negative sample biases. To properly explain this discrepancy, we examined the character of the band edges of the MABr-flat surface model and show in Fig. 4(d) and (e) the local DOS around the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM), respectively. Indeed, in Fig. 4(d), we observed strongly delocalized VBM states that are mainly composed of Br 4p orbitals. On the other hand, the CBM states dominated by Pb 6p orbitals remain localized around the Pb atoms (Fig. 4(e)), which explains the current being completely suppressed at negative sample biases.
Conclusions
In summary, using a combination of AFM measurements and DFT calculations, we carried out an atomistic study of the degradation of clean and flat single-crystal MAPbBr3 surfaces prepared through cleavage. We found that the freshly cleaved MAPbBr3 surface forms a stable MABr-terminated configuration, as confirmed by the calculation of surface energies of various surface terminations. Importantly, we observed that under UHV and dark conditions the surface still degrades to form PbBr2 clusters surrounded by pits, which we interpreted to be caused by the trace presence of hydroxyl radicals. Finally, we observed a strong current signal from the MAPbBr3 surface only at positive sample biases, and explained the complete suppression of current at negative sample biases in terms of the strongly localized character of the Pb-originated CBM states. This work provides the first direct observation of the clean and unmodified structure of single-crystal MAPbBr3 and its surface degradation at room temperature using a real-space imaging technique. The combined experimental characterization and DFT calculations provide a detailed atomic-scale understanding of the surface terminations of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites and their degradation mechanisms, which will be valuable information for the effective design and optimization of perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Topography of freshly cleaved MAPbBr3, measured using contact-mode AFM. The scale bar is 200 nm. (b) Height profile from the dotted red line in (a) showing single step heights of the crystalline MAPbBr3. A schematic diagram of the cubic MAPbBr3 structure is overlaid to guide the eye. (c) Surface slab model showing the cleaved MAPbBr3 (001) surface with MABr-flat termination. The inset shows a zoomed-in image of the region in the black square box. (d) Phase diagram for different surface terminations as a function of the Pb and Br chemical potentials. For typical thermodynamic conditions, PbBr2-flat and Vacant surfaces are the stable surface configurations.	 

 	Fig. 2  Topography of the MAPbBr3 after (a) 7 and (b) 22 days in the UHV chamber. (b) Formation of a pit around the degraded clusters is indicated by the dotted yellow line. (c) Coverage of the degraded clusters over time in the UHV chamber. (d) Topography of a cluster that exhibits hexagonal symmetry resembling the PbBr2 crystalline structure. The scale bars are 200 nm.	 

 	Fig. 3  Proposed degradation pathway for the MAPbBr3 single crystal in the UHV chamber in the presence of water vapor. The Vacant and Vacant′ surfaces have similar morphologies with the difference of just one PbBr2 molecule in the topmost atomic layer.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Topography (top) and conductance (bottom) images of the MAPbBr3 at various sample biases. The conductance images show a range of ±0.4 nA. Scale bars are 100 nm. (b) Results of current–voltage (I–V) spectroscopy via conductive AFM (CAFM) of freshly cleaved MAPbBr3. (c) Calculated density of states of the most-favored MABr-terminated structure. Integrated local charge density around (d) the valence band maximum and (e) conduction band minimum exhibiting delocalized and localized carrier states, respectively.
