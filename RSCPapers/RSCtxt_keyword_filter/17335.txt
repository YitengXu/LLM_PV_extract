    , Accepted 16th February 2015First published on 17th February 2015AbstractUltrafast excited-state processes play a key role in organic electronics and photovoltaics, governing the way of how excitons can relax and separate. Through the use of nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics, relaxation processes were investigated at the sub-picosecond timescale in thiophene and oligothiophenes (nT, n = 2, 3, 4), prototype oligomers for efficient π-electron conjugated polymers adopted in photovoltaics. For thiophene, TDDFT and TDA nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics revealed ultrafast nonradiative relaxation processes through ring opening and ring puckering, bringing the system to an S1/S0 conical intersection seam. The computed relaxation time is 110 fs, matching well the experimental one (∼105 fs). In oligothiophenes (n = 2–4), high-energy (hot) excitations were considered. Exciton relaxation through the manifold of excited states to the lowest excited state is predicted to occur within ∼150–200 fs, involving bond stretching, ring puckering, and torsional oscillations. For the longer oligomer (4T), the ultrafast relaxation process leads to exciton localization over three thiophene rings in 150 fs. These data agree with the self-localization mechanism (∼100–200 fs) observed for poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and shed light on the complex exciton relaxation dynamics occurring in π-conjugated oligomers of potential interest for optoelectronic applications.
1. Introduction
Photovoltaics has assumed a primary role in the last few decades, representing a reliable, clean, and renewable way to produce energy from sunlight.1 In this frame, organic π-electron conjugated materials, in the form of small molecules, polymers, or molecular aggregates,2 became attractive candidates for photovoltaic applications,3 along with other classes of materials such as amorphous silicon,4 dye-sensitized systems,5 and perovskites.6–8
In organic photovoltaics (OPV), the device is prepared as a blend of two materials, an optically-active electron donor (D) and an electron acceptor (A). Light is absorbed by the optically-active material creating a photoexcited species, usually referred to as exciton (i.e. a bound electron–hole pair). The exciton, in a simple picture, diffuses through the material, the charges are then separated at the donor–acceptor (D–A) interface, and finally they are collected at electrodes.1,9 In these basic steps of light-to-current production, the bottleneck in OPV efficiency consists of the ability to separate the photoinitiated electron–hole species10 and to avoid any kind of dissipative channels, like excited-state internal conversion or charge recombination.11 For this reason, ultrafast photoinduced deactivation processes play a key role in OPV, determining the fate of the early photoexcited species and how the energy will be released, redistributed, and transferred.12–15
High-resolution ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy (e.g. pump–probe or pump–push–probe techniques)16 revealed that for π-conjugated molecules and polymers, exciton relaxation to the lowest excited state occurs within tens to hundreds of femtoseconds, evolving from delocalized states toward more localized ones.17–19 For instance, in P3HT (poly(3-hexylthiophene)), one of the most studied, best performing OPV materials amongst homo-polymers, the majority of the Stokes shift and anisotropy decay in solution or film happen in the first 200 fs.17,20 This means that in P3HT ultrafast exciton dynamics, from an extended delocalized excited state to a state localized over a few monomers,21,22 occurs within the first hundreds of femtoseconds. Similar dynamics were observed for the last generation of OPV polymeric materials, giving power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of up to 13%.23 Compounds better known by the acronyms PCDTBT,24 PCPDTBT,19 and PBDTTPD25 are examples of such efficient D–A copolymers. All of them undergo ultrafast excited-state relaxation,26–28 recovering the Stokes shift in the first 200 fs both in solution and in solid-state films.
A variety of parameters affect the excited-state dynamics, such as excitation energies, solvent, molecular aggregation, and morphology of the films.17 In any case, however, the typical time-scales for the initial relaxation dynamics are observed to be hundreds of femtoseconds.18,21,29,30 Also for D–A bulk heterojunction solar cells, regardless of the organic materials (small molecules, homo- or co-polymers) used as donors, it has been generally found that the initial excited-state dynamics and charge-transfer process occurs in 100–200 fs.31–33
At this stage, it is highly desirable to strengthen the understanding of the basic relaxation processes34,35 underlying the ultrafast exciton deactivation in organic π-conjugated materials,11,36–42 to help to make sense of all this accumulated empirical information.
Many insightful computational and theoretical investigations were published in the last years. Clark et al.43 recently studied the femtosecond (100 fs) torsional relaxation mechanisms in oligofluorenes (oligomers of interest for OPV, light emitting diodes, and photonic applications) via combined transient absorption spectroscopy and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. They were able to elucidate the ultrafast transitions from Sn (high-energy singlet excited states) to S1 through a series of nonadiabatic events in which the system undergoes ultrafast conformational (torsional) changes.
Nelson et al.44 applied nonadiabatic excited-state molecular dynamics to a series of interesting materials for OPV applications, such as oligomers of poly-(phenylene ethylene) (PPV),45 poly-(phenylene ethynylene) (PPE),46 and the donor p-DTS(PTTh2)2, the latter featuring the record high of 6.7% PCE amongst small molecules.47 Their methodology combines the fewest-switches surface hopping (FSSH) approach48 with excited-state calculations using the collective electronic oscillator method at the configuration interaction singles (CIS) level based on the semiempirical AM1 model Hamiltonian.49 They demonstrated that the redistribution of the excess electronic energy occurs on the femtosecond time scale, involving vibrational degrees of freedom coupled to the electronic system.
Prezhdo et al.50–54 developed an efficient methodology for surface hopping dynamics based on single-determinant DFT55 and applied it to study exciton and charge transfer dynamics in organic/organic interfaces,54 carbon naonotubes,50 and hybrid materials.56 For the case of the P3HT polymer/carbon nanotube interface, they found an asymmetry in the electron and hole dynamics, with the first one being orders of magnitude faster than the latter.57
Tamura et al.12–14,58 investigated the ultrafast charge separation in P3HT/C60, showing that efficient charge separation is enhanced by electron delocalization and high-energy excitation.12,13 Dynamics were carried out using the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method, based on a linear vibronic coupling (LVC) model.14
In the current work, we use surface hopping based on time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and the Tamm–Dancoff approximation (TDA) to investigate the exciton relaxation dynamics and their typical time scales in oligothiophenes. Oligothiophenes, although well known since decades for their optoelectronic properties,59–61 still represent the best model for studying more interesting and efficient materials like P3HT10 or thiophene-based polymers used nowadays in OPV applications.3 Furthermore, there is still not yet a complete physical–chemical understanding regarding their ultrafast (∼50–200 fs) excited-state deactivation mechanisms.
We investigated four different species, systematically increasing their size (Scheme 1) from a single thiophene ring (1T) up to oligomers with four rings (4T). The effects of electron delocalization on the exciton relaxation dynamics were explored considering both low- and high-energy excitations.20
 Scheme 1 
The basic questions we want to address are: which are the main excited-state deactivation mechanisms in oligothiophenes? What is the effect of the π-electron conjugation length on the internal deactivation processes and on the time scales? Which is the typical relaxation time scale after high-energy excitation?
As background to these physical–chemical investigations, we have performed a systematic methodological search concerning the computational parameters for thiophene to identify the most adequate, yet affordable, DFT functionals, basis sets, and methods (TDDFT vs. TDA). Complementary to a recent benchmark study reported by our group,62 these are results of interest in their own right for computational chemists, which will be presented and validated against experimental data and multireference results from the literature.
2. Methods
Ground- and excited-state properties of oligothiophenes nT, with n = 1–4, were investigated with DFT. Absorption cross sections were computed with the nuclear ensemble method based on harmonic oscillator Wigner distributions.63 Diverse computational methods and levels were considered in these simulations. They are specified in Table 1.

Nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics69–71 were done with TDDFT (and also TDA69 for 1T) using the FSSH method48 as implemented in NEWTON-X72,73 interfaced with Gaussian 09.74 The time step for integration of the classical equations was 0.5 fs. The integration of the quantum equations was done with 0.025 fs steps using interpolated properties between classical steps. Time-dependent coefficients were corrected for decoherence effects as described in ref. 75. Nonadiabatic couplings between excited states were computed by finite differences.76–78 Due to the limitations of the linear-response TDDFT and Kohn–Sham DFT to provide reliable electronic states near intersections with the ground state,76 nonadiabatic transitions between the excited and the ground states were not computed. Trajectories ran for a maximum of 300 fs or until a crossing with the ground state (within 0.1 eV) was reached. In such cases, the last time step was taken as an indication of internal conversion to the ground state.79 Under this assumption, the occupation of the ground state (n0), at each time step, was computed as: n0 = (nhops/Ntraj)·n1′, with (nhops/Ntraj) the number of S1/S0 hops over the total number of trajectories and n1′ the occupation (fraction of trajectories) of S1 before the transition, as given by the FSSH algorithm. To compensate the transfer to S0, the S1 occupation was corrected to n1 = (1 − nhops/Ntraj)·n1′. The occupations of all other states were given by the FSSH algorithm as usual.
Several sets of dynamics simulations were run, with different computational setups. They are described in Table 2. Initial conditions were selected from the simulated spectra at the same level, from within narrow spectral windows. Because different adiabatic states may contribute to the same spectral window, the number of trajectories starting in each state was determined by a stochastic algorithm sampling the points of the Wigner distribution according to their oscillator strengths. Thus, for instance, dynamics of 1T simulated with TDDFT/ωB97XD/6-31G* (see Table 2) started at 6.0 ± 0.5 eV, with 171 trajectories initially in S1 and 118 in S2.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Ultrafast deactivation mechanisms for thiophene
The excited states and ultrafast deactivation mechanisms for thiophene have been extensively investigated in the past few years. Seminal theoretical and computational studies using DFT (TDDFT, DFT/MRCI), coupled cluster methods (CC2, CCSD and CCSDR(3)), and multireference (CASPT2) methods have been reported by Marian et al.,81–84 Stenrup et al.,85 and Fang et al.86 Absorption bands in the gas-phase electronic spectrum have been attributed to two low-lying absorbing singlet states featuring π–π* character.87 Time-resolved pump–probe femtosecond multiphoton ionization spectroscopy revealed the presence of ultrafast relaxation dynamics (via nonradiative decays) after photoexcitation.83 Thiophene is in fact a nonfluorescent molecule and a possible mechanism proposed for excited-state relaxation involves an ultrafast decay (∼80 ± 10 fs) of the initial wavepacket to the low-lying excited states, followed by a subsequent fast decay (∼25 ± 10 fs) via a conical intersection (i.e. ring opening) to S0.83
Potential energy profiles computed at the TDDFT//DFT/MRCI and MS-CASPT2 levels provided the energies and geometries of the excited-state minima (puckered configuration) and the S1/S0 conical intersection (ring opening).82,85 Nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics at the CASSCF level,86 covering only the first singlet excited state, predicted an ultrafast decay to the ground state via a ring opening conical intersection, with an averaged time constant of 65 ± 5 fs. However, this study ignored the fact that two close-lying singlet excited states (S1 and S2) are concomitantly photoexcited by the pump laser, which limits the validity of the results.
Here, we report TDDFT and TDA nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics of 1T, which for the first time considers both the S1 and S2 states.

3.1.1. 1T: absorption spectrum, minima, and potential energy profiles. 
As the starting point for the investigation, absorption spectra were calculated via the nuclear ensemble method. Fig. 1 shows the TDDFT vs. TDA spectra for two different functionals (ωB97XD vs. B3LYP) and basis sets (6-31G* and 6-311+G*). The contributions of the S0 → S1 and S0 → S2 transitions to the first absorption band are reported in black and grey, respectively.
 Fig. 1  Absorption cross sections (in Å2 per molecule) computed with the nuclear ensemble method. Results from different methods (TDDFT vs. TDA), functionals (ωB97XD vs. B3LYP), and basis sets (6-31G* vs. 6-311+G*) are compared. Black and grey lines represent the S0 → S1 and S0 → S2 absorption profiles. Gas-phase experimental spectrum (blue line) taken from ref. 87. 
In both TDDFT and TDA methods, the basis set choice strongly affects the intensity ratio between the first (5.0–6.5 eV) and the second absorption (∼6.5–8 eV) bands and the energy range of the latter. An extended basis set (6-311+G*) increases the global cross section of the second band without affecting, in terms of the spectral range and intensity, the first band. The first absorption band consists of a convolution of two absorptions, S0 → S1 (black line in Fig. 1) and S0 → S2 (grey line), both characterized by π–π* transitions (see Table 3 and ESI,† Section S1). Because of their overlap and vicinity, both S1 and S2 excited states have to be considered in the nonadiabatic dynamics investigation.

For the larger basis set, the computed TDDFT absorption spectra quantitatively reproduce the experimental gas phase spectrum,87 see Fig. 1. Generally, ωB97XD overestimates the energy of the second absorption band, while B3LYP nicely agrees with the experimental spectrum. TDA, in turn, overestimates the vertical transition energies by ∼0.2–0.3 eV with respect to TDDFT (Table 3 and Fig. 1).
The comparison between B3LYP and the measurements does not cover the relative energies of dark states that do not show up in the spectrum. ωB97XD should provide a better balanced description of all kinds of states; this is confirmed by the superior results for the dynamics obtained with the latter functional (see Section 3.1.2). In ref. 88, structural and electronic properties of oligothiophenes with up to 20 rings were investigated with different functionals. It was shown that ωB97XD is one of the functionals with the lowest error in predicting quantities like ionization potentials, bond length alternations, and electronic transitions in neutral and charged species, while B3LYP usually tends to underestimate the values for the longer chain lengths.
Minima of excited states were computed at the TDDFT level (see equilibrium geometries in the ESI,† Section S2). The equilibrium structures have nonplanar puckered or ring opening geometries, as also obtained in previous TDDFT and MS-CASPT2 simulations.82,85 In the puckered structures, sulfur is out of the ring plane and the TDDFT computed degree of distortion is ∼18°, while MS-CASPT2 predicts 27°.
Optimized potential energy profiles were computed as well at the TDDFT level (see ESI,† Section S3), considering two reaction coordinates, namely the C–S stretching (ring opening) and the out-of-plane distortion (ring puckering). As already observed in DFT/MRCI and MS-CASPT2 calculations,83,85 the C–S elongation strongly destabilizes S0 and stabilizes S1, bringing the thiophene to a S1/S0 conical intersection.


3.1.2. 1T: nonadiabatic dynamics. 
Nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics runs were performed comparing TDDFT vs. TDA methods and ωB97XD vs. B3LYP functionals. Trajectories were initiated from the first absorption band, thus populating both S1 and S2 states. Dynamics with different basis sets (6-31G* and 6-311+G*) were tested as well, but no significant differences were found (see ESI,† Section S4). For this reason, and to be consistent with the excited-state dynamics run for the oligothiophenes, we discuss only the 6-31G* data in the following.
All combinations of methods and functions predict an ultrafast deactivation of the photoexcited species. Fig. 2(a) and (b) shows the occupation of the excited states as a function of time. Time constants for excited-state deactivation and ground-state population dynamics were derived through an exponential fitting in the case of ωB97XD. The same procedure was not applied to the B3LYP case, because the occupation of the electronic states vs. time is clearly non-exponential. These time constants and also those for the 6-311+G* basis set (ESI,† Section S4) are given in Table 4.

According to the TDDFT-ωB97XD/6-31G* data, S1 is populated in 80 fs, while S0 is populated 30 fs later. These results nicely agree with the experiments,83 which report first a vibrational relaxation to S1 (τ1 = 80 ± 10 fs) followed by internal conversion to the ground state (25 ± 10 fs). Although qualitatively correct, when computed with TDA-ωB97XD/6-31G*, τ1 is somewhat larger than the experimental value. For TDDFT no significant basis set effect is observed, while for the TDA basis set extension leads to a smaller value for τ1 (presumably reflecting some change in the excited-state potential energy surfaces). Further systematic studies would be necessary to fully investigate this effect.
We analyzed the C–S bond lengths (both C–S bonds because they are not equivalent during the dynamics) and the puckering angle (defined as a C–C–C–S dihedral angle) along the trajectories. Results are reported in Fig. 2(c–f). For each method, in the first stage of the deactivation (∼80 fs), a huge elongation of one C–S bond occurs, from ∼1.75 Å to ∼2.2 Å. For TDA (ωB97XD), the mean C–S distance reaches almost 3 Å. In this stage, the ring is almost flat (small out-of-plane distortion, Fig. 2e and f) and afterwards it starts to oscillate in a range up to 10°–20°. The computed average values of C–S elongations and ring puckering deformations, compared to the static potential energy profile calculations (see ESI,† Section S3), match well the S1/S0 intersection geometries found for 1T.85
In Fig. 3 we show one representative trajectory from the TDDFT (ωB97XD) nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics. At t = 0, the thiophene ring is flat. At t = 42 fs, the ring puckering and C–S bond elongation start to occur (see central panel, lateral and top views). Around t = 100 fs, the energy difference between S1 and S0 drops below 0.8 eV and at t = 130 fs an S1/S0 intersection characterized by a ring opening occurs.

To briefly summarize this section, we computed TDDFT and TDA absorption spectra (including vibrational broadening) and nonadiabatic dynamics for thiophene. The dynamics simulations, making use of ωB97XD, reproduce the experimental data well. The deactivation mechanisms involve simultaneous ring opening and ring puckering on the 100 fs time scale.

3.2. Exciton dynamics after high-energy excitations in oligothiophenes
For the simulation of oligothiphenes, we considered only the ωB97XD functional for the evaluation of absorption spectra and excited-state dynamics. This was done because, first, the inclusion of dispersion interactions is necessary for long π-conjugated systems and interacting π–π systems88,89 and, second, the inclusion of range-separation corrections is needed to appropriately describe charge-transfer and Rydberg excited states in longer π-conjugated systems.88
In thiophene, fluorescence is completely quenched by nonradiative mechanisms involving singlet state deactivations (as discussed in the previous section). Upon increasing the number of thiophene rings, fluorescence turns on with high quantum yield.90 In fact, oligothiophenes were extensively studied for their emissive properties (in solution or aggregates)91–94 and used as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs).95
By increasing the π-electron conjugation and the chain length, the quantum yield and the lifetime of the emitting state increase, which implies less efficient internal conversion from S1 to S0. For this reason, it is interesting to investigate the excited-state dynamics upon low- and high-energy photoexcitation, and to explore the decay mechanisms through the manifold of excited states.49 Furthermore, high-energy excitation (also called hot excitation32,33) has been demonstrated to be effective in increasing the internal power conversion efficiency in bulk heterojunction OPV.13,32,33 Therefore, a molecular understanding of the time-dependent effects, even for pristine oligomers/polymers, is urgent.

3.2.1. Spectrum simulations. 
In Fig. 4 we report the TD-ωB97XD/6-31G* absorption spectra of 1T, 2T, 3T, and 4T. The spectrum of 1T, also given in Fig. 1, is shown here once more to make the comparison of the whole series easier. The experimental spectra of 2T–4T were measured in dioxane,92 while the spectrum of 1T was recorded in the gas phase.87 For 2T–4T, the experimental cross sections shown in Fig. 4 were divided by the refractive index of dioxane (nr = 1.42) to compensate for solvent effects.63
 Fig. 4  TDDFT (ωB97XD/6-31G*) absorption spectra (cross section, σ, in Å2 per molecule) from 1T (bottom panel) to 4T (upper panel). Sticks represent TDDFT vertical transition energies with heights proportional to their oscillator strengths. Experimental spectra (grey lines) taken from ref. 87 (1T) and 92 (2T–4T). 
The computed spectra well reproduce the experimental ones90,92 in terms of the spectral energy, band intensity ratio, and band width. In a recent computational study, Improta et al.96 claimed that the CAM-B3LYP and PBE0 functionals provide the best predictions for absorption and emission spectra of dithiophene (2T). In the ESI† (see Section S5), we compare the re-computed (via nuclear ensemble method) CAM-B3LYP and PBE0 absorption spectra with the ωB97XD spectrum, showing the full validity and accuracy of the latter. A comparison of the spectra computed with the 6-31G* and 6-311+G* basis is provided in the ESI,† Section S6. We also computed the vertical transition energies for the longest oligomer (4T) using B3LYP, see ESI† (Section S6 and Table S6.3). B3LYP predicts the vertical energy of the bright S1 state at 2.9 eV, even lower than the experimental data. This strengthens the choice of the ωB97XD functional as the best compromise to describe both short and long π-conjugated systems.
The red shift of the low-energy band with increasing chain length and π-electron conjugation is well reproduced by ωB97XD. The high-energy band for oligothiophenes, centered at 5.5 eV, is blue-shifted by ∼0.5 eV in comparison to the available experimental data90 and, accordingly, it does not shift with the chain length as the low-energy band does. It is interesting to notice how much the origin of the low-energy band is red-shifted (∼0.5–0.7 eV) with respect to the vertical transition, pointing to the importance of considering the simulation of the full band envelope for a correct prediction of the electronic spectrum. The electronic transitions belonging to both low- and high-energy bands have π–π* character. The molecular orbitals involved in the excitations are reported in the ESI,† Section S1. Ground- and excited-state equilibrium geometries are also given in the ESI,† Section S7.


3.2.2. Excited-state dynamics of 2T. 
Trajectories were initiated from the low- and high-energy bands. The main results from TDDFT nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics of 2T are collected in Fig. 5.
 Fig. 5  TDDFT (ωB97XD/6-31G*) nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics. Left(right) side, low(high)-energy band excitation. Panel (a) occupation of each electronic state investigated. Panel (b) C–S bond elongation (R(CS)) vs. time. Molecular structure of 2T, with atom labeling, shown as the inset. Panel (c) ring puckering (δ) vs. time; panel (d) torsional angle (τ) coordinate (S1–C5–C6–S7) vs. time. 

Fig. 5a shows the occupation for each electronic state, upon low- and high-energy excitations, in the 300 fs time window. The photophysics of 2T differs extremely from that of 1T: the π-electron conjugation between aromatic rings stabilizes the S1 state, thus limiting the nonradiative channels between S1 and S0 when the first absorption band is photoexcited.29
When starting in the low-energy band (4.5 ± 0.2 eV) where only the S1 state is populated (see Table 2), 35 out of 40 trajectories reached the maximum simulation time (300 fs) without crossing to the ground state. Only 5 trajectories stopped at a crossing with the ground state (ΔE(S1–S0) < 0.1 eV). The occupation of S1 at 300 fs is 80%, reflecting the reduction of S1/S0 nonradiative channels on the ultrafast time scale.
By exciting the high-energy band (5.5 ± 0.5 eV), all states up to S6 were populated, especially S3 to S5 (Table 2 and Fig. 5). 44 trajectories were propagated and 31 of them reached the S1/S0 crossing within 300 fs, namely 9 within 75 fs, 14 between 75 and 150 fs, and 8 after 225 fs. The remaining 13 did not reach the crossing with S0 within the maximum simulation time. Thus, as expected, high-energy excitation increases the occurrence of nonradiative decay channels involving the S1/S0 crossing seam, leading to over 80% occupation of S0 after 300 fs.
In the first 25 fs, ultrafast deactivation occurs and population is transferred to S2via nonadiabatic transitions. The S1 occupation rises as well and reaches about 40% within 75 fs. From 75 to 175 fs, the occupation of high-lying excited states decreases nearly to zero and S0 starts to be populated. Between 175 and 200 fs, the majority of the photoexcited population decay to S0. At 300 fs, the S1 occupation is less than 20%, with the remaining population transferred to S0. Similar to the 1T case, the deactivation mechanism involves large C–S bond deformations and ring puckering, and the conical intersection seam with the ground state is characterized by the ring opening of one thiophene (see ESI,† Sections S8 and S9).

Fig. 5b reports the C–S bond elongations along the dynamics started from both low- and high-energy bands. While in the low-energy case the C–S bond oscillations are limited between 1.7 to 1.9 Å, excitation in the high-energy band leads to trajectories with a higher kinetic energy that undergo larger oscillations (up to 2.1 Å), which contributes to dissipative processes. In particular, the inner C–S bonds (C1–S5 and C6–S7, Fig. 5b) undergo strong variations, similar to those observed in 1T (see Fig. 2b). Huge C–S elongations occur in the first 75–80 fs (as in 1T case), which is the time for transferring the photoexcited population from high-lying excited states to the S2 and S1 states. The excess kinetic energy is mostly transformed into deformation energy in terms of C–S stretching (see ESI,† Section S10 for an example of a trajectory leading 2T to the S1/S0 intersection seam through a ring opening mechanism).
Simultaneously, the two rings undergo puckering distortions (δ = C4–C3–C2–S1 and C10–C9–C8–S7, Fig. 5c) and oscillations (stronger for the high-energy excitation than the low-energy band). We also monitored the torsional angle (τ) between the two thiophene rings along the dynamics (Fig. 5d): τ oscillates passing through a flat conformation in ∼100 fs when exciting the low-energy band, and in ∼175 fs when exciting in the high-energy regime. It is worth noticing that fast oscillations, like C–S bond stretching and ring puckering, are more effective than the torsional ones in the dynamics of high-energy deactivation mechanisms. Indeed, they drive the majority of the photoexcited population from Sn to low-lying excited states already in the first 75–100 fs, that is less than half of the period of the torsional oscillation.
Similar conclusions were obtained from TDDFT nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics computed at the PBE0/SVP level. The corresponding results for both low- and high-energy excitations are reported in the ESI† (Section S11).


3.2.3. Excited-state dynamics of 3T. 

Fig. 6 shows the results of the nonadiabatic dynamics for 3T upon high-energy excitation (5.5 eV band, Fig. 4). As reported in Fig. 6a, ultrafast deactivation of the photoexcited species occurs in the first 75 fs with subsequent occupation of S1 (∼40%), through a cascade of nonadiabatic transitions. Starting around 150 fs, the S0 occupation rises, and at 300 fs the ground state is populated with an excess of 50%. From 39 trajectories generated, 4 reached a S1/S0 crossing within 75 fs, 12 within 150 fs, and 10 within 225 fs; 13 trajectories were still in the excited states at 300 fs. (See ESI,† Section S12 for an example of a trajectory leading the system to the S1/S0 intersection seam through a ring opening mechanism and Section S9 for the corresponding potential energy profiles.)

We also monitored the C–S bond lengths (Fig. 6b). Large elongations, from 1.7 up to 2 Å, occur in the inner ring in the first 75–100 fs, which is the time required to significantly populate S1 (>50%). A flat conformation of 3T is reached at 160 fs. Ultrafast bond oscillations (in particular C–S stretching) are responsible for the initial exciton relaxation. Torsional oscillations also occur on an ultrafast timescale, but they are not responsible for the initial excited-state deoccupation.


3.2.4. Excited-state dynamics of 4T. 
The 11 excited states needed to simulate the high-energy excitation of 4T make it computationally very demanding to treat this oligomer with FSSH/TDDFT. For this reason, we simulated only a few trajectories (Ntraj = 14). In spite of this limitation, congruent trends can be recognized.

Fig. 7a shows the occupation of all states. It is split into two parts due to the high number of excited states involved. We report the occupation of S12 to S6 at the top and the occupation of S5 to S0 at the bottom. Similar to the 2T and 3T cases, there is an ultrafast deactivation of the high-energy excited states within the first 50 fs. The occupation of the low-energy excited states (S3, S2, S1) starts to increase after 75 fs. From 120 to 250 fs the occupation is almost constant, oscillating between S2 and S1. The ground state starts to be populated (>40%) within 270 fs. From 14 trajectories generated, 1 reached a S1/S0 crossing within 75 fs, 2 within 150 fs, 1 within 225 fs, and 10 were still in the excited states after 300 fs.
 Fig. 7  TDDFT (ωB97XD/6-31G*) nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics for 4T. Panel (a) occupation of each excited state from the high-energy band as a function of time. Panel (b) C–S bond elongations vs. time, panel (c) torsional angles (τ1, τ2, and τ3) vs. time. 
Looking at the oscillations of all C–S bonds, those belonging to the inner rings, C6–S7 (blue line in Fig. 7b) and C8–S7 (pink line in Fig. 7b) undergo larger deformations than the external ones. In particular, their maximum deformation of 2.0 Å is reached after around 150 fs when low-lying excited states (S2 and S1) are occupied to ∼80%. The three dihedral angles oscillate mostly with the same period, and a flat conformation is reached between 125 and 225 fs.


3.2.5. Exciton localization in oligothiophenes. 
To better understand the photophysics and exciton dynamics of oligothiophenes, we analyzed the electronic density difference between the excited states and the ground state as a function of time for the longest oligomer (4T). These data are reported in Fig. 8 for a representative trajectory. Electron-deficient regions are represented in orange and electron-rich regions are represented in green.
 Fig. 8  Snapshots of the electronic-density difference between the occupied excited state and the ground state for a representative 4T trajectory. Orange regions are electron-poor, green are electron-rich. Bottom panel: time evolution of the excited-state energies for the trajectory considered in the analysis (TD-ωB97XD/6-31G*). 
At t = 0, the photoexcited state (S11) is completely delocalized over the four thiophene rings, with electron-rich density difference located on both inter-ring regions and on carbon–carbon ring bonds, featuring a quinoidal character.97
At t = 140 fs, the S2 → S1 nonadiabatic transition occurs leading to a localization of the electronic density over three thiophene rings. This localization over three units is kept for the rest of the dynamics, until 300 fs.
The process reflects well the experimental results from ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy on long oligothiophenes or P3HT in solution,20–22,24 in which self-exciton localization over a few aromatic units occurs in 200 fs.
Although 4T is not representative for long oligothiophenes or polymers, such as P3HT (where ten units should be considered),62,98 we believe that the ultrafast exciton photophysics is already well captured and well described at this oligomer level.

4. Conclusions
The relaxation processes occurring on an ultrafast time scale for thiophene and oligothiophenes (nT) were investigated using nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics.
For the first time, TDDFT and TDA nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics were applied to study the photophysics of thiophene (1T). Competitive effects due to the photoexcitation of multiple low-lying excited states were taken into account. TDDFT quantitatively reproduces the absorption spectrum of 1T and the ultrafast relaxation time scales, as probed by femtosecond photoelectron spectroscopy.83
Thiophene excited-state relaxation involves huge elongations of the CS bond, which drives the system to the S1/S0 intersection seam on an ultrafast timescale (∼80 fs). The computed TDDFT decay time for the excited-state deactivation is 110 fs, while the experimental one is 105 fs.
Dynamics of high-energy photoexcitations were investigated with the aim of understanding the typical relaxation mechanisms and time scales in oligothiophenes.
In oligomers, π-electron delocalization stabilizes the system, limiting the access to non-radiative decay channels between S1 and S0 with increasing chain length. The fraction of trajectories in the excited states at 300 fs after high-energy excitation increases from 0.30 in 2T to 0.33 in 3T and to 0.71 in 4T. This implies an elongation of the lifetime or a reduction of the S1/S0 internal-conversion probability or both.
Regardless of the oligomer length, photorelaxation to the lowest excited state takes place through a cascade of ultrafast nonadiabatic transfers amongst the manifold of excited states, within ∼150–200 fs. Excited state relaxation processes are driven prevalently by fast motions, notably CS stretching and ring puckering deformations (70–100 fs).
For the longest oligomer considered here, 4T, an exciton localization mechanism during the dynamics was observed. The initial photoexcited state is fully delocalized over four units and becomes localized over three units within 140 fs. Interestingly, the localization process occurs at the same time scale as experimentally observed for P3HT (∼150–200 fs).21,22,29
As a general outcome, we conclude that the typical exciton relaxation decay time for thiophene-based materials (i.e. the time to populate S1), upon high-energy excitations, is of the order of 150–200 fs. In the frame of photovoltaics, this implies that any exciton dissociation process has to happen on a time scale faster than 200 fs, as recently observed in some polymer/fullerene99 or polymer/oxide interfaces.30 Only in this way is it possible to avoid inefficient mechanisms for light-to-current conversion (e.g. non-radiative decays or emission phenomena) and to raise the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells.
