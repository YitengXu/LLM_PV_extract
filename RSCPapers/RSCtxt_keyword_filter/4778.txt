    , Accepted 28th August 2016First published on 29th August 2016AbstractTwo copolymers P1 and P2, with regioregular and random structures, respectively, were synthesized and their optical and electrochemical properties (both theoretical and experimental) were investigated. The regioregular copolymer P1 showed a lower optical bandgap and a high degree of crystallinity compared to the random P2 copolymer. These copolymers were used as electron donors along with PC71BM as the electron acceptor for the fabrication of solution processed bulk heterojunction solar cells. After the optimization of the weight ratio between the donor and the acceptor and the concentration of the solvent additive i.e. DIO in chloroform, the solar cells based on regioregular P1 exhibit higher power conversion efficiency (7.66%) than the random P2 (5.33%). The enhancement in the power conversion efficiency has been attributed to the increased hole mobility due to the high regioregularity of the conjugated copolymer backbone and effective ordering between the polymer chains. This work brings forth and establishes the importance of copolymers having a regioregular A–D–A–D structure so as to offer significant performance benefits over the random D–A copolymer. This approach is a promising new route to materials for highly efficient polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Throughout the last decade, polymer solar cells (PSC) with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) based on nano-composites (polymer donor: fullerene acceptor) have attracted significant attention as renewable energy sources due to their unique advantages, such as low cost, manufacturability, easy possibility for large-area flexible devices manufacturing,1,2 attaining, at the same time, impressive progress in PSC effectiveness by more than 10%.3–6 This progress has been achieved not only through better understanding and control of charge generation and transport, but also via development of a wide range of new narrow bandgap D–A conjugated copolymers7,8 using generally the donor–acceptor (D–A) approach, i.e. copolymers based on alternating fragments of electron donor (D) and electron acceptor (A) units. However, common D–A copolymers have several disadvantages including the fact that common polycondensation doesn't permit obtaining regioselective polymers D–A using asymmetrical monomers. It is well known, that electronic and optical properties of D–A copolymers are strongly dependent on structural order. PSC based on regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with alternating regular structures exhibit higher efficiency with light absorption and charge carrier mobility improved by intermolecular π-stacking interactions in comparison with statistical P3HT where substituents are oriented randomly along the backbone chain.9 Moreover the regioregular D–A copolymer showed a higher charge carrier mobility than its random counterpart. Recently, Lee et al. synthesized the regioregular PBDTTT-C-T copolymer which exhibited a narrower optical bandgap (1.55 eV) and a higher crystallinity degree compared to the random polymer PBDTTT-C-T. Inverted PSC based on regioregular PBDTTT-C-T possessed a conversion efficiency of 7.79%, which was 19% higher than for PSC based on the random PBDTTT-C-T polymer.10 Müllen and co-workers have also developed the random copolymer BFR1 and the corresponding regioregular BFS3 conjugated copolymer. The random BFR1 copolymer had an efficiency of 3.91% and the corresponding regioregular BFS3 polymer analogue (as a part of polymer solar cell) was found to have an effectiveness of 5.92%, which was 51% higher than that of the PSC based on the random BFR1 copolymer.11 Using molecular modeling and 2D-GISAXS methods, they have proved conclusively that the intermolecular π-stacking interactions have been improved. These data were confirmed by AFM. Thus, photo-absorption improvement and charge carrier mobility increase due to high regioregularity of the conjugated polymers and efficient ordering of polymer chains are the most likely reasons for the increased PSC energy conversion efficiency.
Moreover, fluorination has attracted much attention due to its multiple effects on the optical and electronic properties of resulting copolymers, i.e. the strong withdrawing ability of the fluorine atom can effectively modulate the energy levels of copolymers with minor effects on their bandgap and induce the strong dipole along the C–F bond resulting in the strong inter/intramolecular interaction which benefits exciton dissociation and charge transport.12 Recently, Li et al. have developed a D–A structured copolymer denoted as PBDD-4ff4T with the benzodithiophene-4,8-dione acceptor and difluorinated bithiophene (ff2T) as the donor unit, used it as a donor along with PC71BM as the acceptor for BHJ PSC and achieved an impressive PCE of 9.2% without any extra treatment.13
Inspired by these results, in this article, we have synthesized the regioregular copolymer P1 based on fluorine-containing 2,6-bis(7-bromo-6-fluoro-2-hexyl-2H-benzotriazol-4-yl)-4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b’]dithiophene (M3) and the distannyl monomer M1 and the corresponding random D–A polymer analogue P2 based on asymmetric dibromide 2-hexyl-4,7-dibromo-5-fluorobenzo-1,2,3-triazole (M2). As shown in Scheme 2, we present a step-by-step synthetic strategy based on the A–D–A intermediate, which allows obtaining regioregular polymers through the fixed orientation of the acceptor unit. To demonstrate this strategy we have chosen the monofluorinated precursor, 2-hexyl-4,7-dibromo-5-fluorobenzo-1,2,3-triazole (M2), which exhibits asymmetrical reactivity between ortho- and meta-positions. The obtained random polymer based on P2 inherently possesses a structural disadvantage negatively affecting photovoltaic solar cells characteristics. Due to the fact that the acceptor monomer M2 has an asymmetric molecular structure, it is impossible to control the 2-hexyl-5-fluorobenzo-1,2,3-triazole unit orientation in the conjugated polymer chain during the polycondensation reaction. So, the P2 copolymer generally has random structural regioregularity. Regioregular P1 exhibits a narrow bandgap (Eoptg = 1.75 eV), and a higher crystallinity degree compared with random P2. These copolymers were used as donors along with PC71BM as the acceptor for the fabrication of conventional BHJ PSC solar cells. After the optimization of the weight ratio of the donor to the acceptor and concentration of solvent additive (DIO), the PSC based regioregular P1 showed an overall PCE of 7.66% which is higher than that for the random copolymer P2 (5.33%) fabricated and characterized under identical conditions.

Synthesis of copolymers P1
The polymerization was performed by a Stille coupling reaction. In a 50 mL flask, monomers M1 (0.3722 g, 0.5 mmol) and M3 (0.5076 g, 0.5 mmol) were dissolved in 15 mL toluene, and the solution was flushed with argon for 15 min, then 27 mg of Pd(PPh3)4 was added into the solution. The mixture was again flushed with argon for 20 min. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux for 48 h. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and added dropwise to 400 mL methanol. The precipitate was collected and further purified by Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane, and chloroform in sequence. The chloroform fraction was concentrated and added dropwise into methanol. Finally, the precipitates were collected and dried under vacuum overnight to get polymer P1 as a black solid (0.50 g, yield 79%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ (ppm) 8.50–7.00 (br, 6H, ArH), 4.85 (4H, CH2–N), 2.27–2.21 (br, 8H, CH2–Si), 1.70–0.80 (br, 82H, CH3, CH2).

Synthesis of copolymers P2
Copolymer P2 was synthesized by following the same procedure for P1 but using M2 instead of M3. Monomers M2 (0.1695 g, 0.5 mmol) and M1 (0.3722 g, 0.5 mmol) were used as starting materials in the polymerization. Finally, P2 was obtained as a black solid (0.27 g, yield 85%).1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ(ppm) 8.50–7.00 (br, 3H, ArH), 4.85 (2H, CH2–N), 2.27–2.21 (br, 4H, CH2–Si), 1.70–0.80 (br, 41H, CH3, CH2).

Device fabrication and characterization
BHJ polymer solar cells with the conventional structure ITO /PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/PFN/Al were prepared on an indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate as follows: an ITO coated glass substrate was cleaned by ultrasonic treatment in deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol sequentially and then dried using nitrogen gas. After that, a thin layer (35 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)) was spin coated at 3500 rpm for 40 s on the ITO coated glass substrate and subsequently baked at 120 °C for 15 min in air. The copolymers and PC71BM (total concentration of 20 mg mL−1) at different weight ratios were dissolved in chloroform and spin coated at 2000 rpm for 1 min on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. After the optimization of the weight ratio of copolymer to PC71BM, we have employed the solvent additive technique to deposit the active layer film, i.e. the copolymer:PC71BM (1:2) was dissolved into chloroform with the different concentrations of DIO and the film spin cast described above. The thickness of the active layers was 85–90 nm. Finally a thin layer of aluminium was deposited by thermal evaporation under a shadow mask with a base pressure less than 10−5 Torr, on top of the active layer. The current–voltage characteristics of the BHJ organic solar cells were measured using a computer controlled Keithley 238 source meter under simulated AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2. A solar simulator consisting of a xenon light source coupled with an optical filter was used to provide the stimulated irradiance at the surface of the devices. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured illuminating the device through the light source and monochromator and the resulting current was measured using a Keithley electrometer under short circuit conditions. The hole-only devices with the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au were also fabricated in an analogous manner, in order to measure the hole and electron mobilities. All the measurements were performed in air without encapsulation of the devices.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes to the monomers, 2,6-bis(7-bromo-6-fluoro-2-hexyl-2H-benzotriazol-4-yl)-4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b’]dithiophene (M3) and polymers P1 and P2 are shown in Scheme 1. 4,4′-Bis(2-ethylhexyl)-5,5′-bis(trimethyltin)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (M1)14 and 2-hexyl-4,7-dibromo-5-fluorobenzo-1,2,3-triazole (M2)15 were prepared according to literature methods. As shown in Scheme 1, the palladium catalyzed Stille coupling reaction of the 4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-5,5′-bis(trimethyltin)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (M1) with an excess amount (2.5 equivalents) of asymmetric dibromointermediate 2-hexyl-4,7-dibromo-5-fluorobenzo-1,2,3-triazole (M2) gave the key monomer, 2,6-bis(7-bromo-6-fluoro-2-hexyl-2H-benzotriazol-4-yl)-4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b’]dithiophene (M3), in 51% yield. All compounds were purified by silica gel column chromatography, and their structures and purity were fully characterized by multinuclear NMR (1H, 13C and 19F) spectroscopy (Fig. 1), high-resolution mass spectroscopy, and elemental analysis.

Both P1 and P2 were synthesized by Stille cross-coupling reaction of dibromide M2 or M3 and 4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-5,5′-bis(trimethyltin)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole (M1) in toluene at 110 °C using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst in ∼80% yield (Scheme 2). Both polymers were purified by extraction with methanol, acetone and hexane to remove small-molecular weight fractions and catalyst residue. Then the solids were collected by using chloroform as the extraction solvent followed by precipitation in methanol and filtration. The molecular weights (Mn) of P1 and P2 were determined by GPC with polystyrene as a standard. Regioregular P1 has an average molecular weight (Mn) of 20.8 kDa with polydispersity (PDI) of 2.01 while the random polymer P2 has (Mn) of 28.1 kDa with a PDI value of 2.08 respectively. Both polymers have similar molecular weights thereby minimizing the influence of molecular weight. Additionally, structures of the two polymers were characterized by elemental analysis, 1H NMR and 19F NMR. From 1H NMR spectra (Fig. 2) all peaks are broad with respect to the corresponding monomers due to the polymeric character. For all polymers, the aromatic protons are observed between 8.50 and 7.00 ppm, the signal of methylene groups adjacent to the nitrogen atom appeared around 4.85 ppm. There is a peak at δ 2.27–2.21 ppm which is attributed to methylene groups directly linked to a silicon atom. The peaks in the ranges of δ 1.70–0.80 ppm are related to other hydrogen protons of the alkyl groups of polymers. In the 1H NMR spectrum of M3 the singlet peak at 8.11 ppm should be assigned to the proton of the dithienosilole unit while the doublet signal at 7.42–7.54 ppm is due to the F-benzotriazole unit (it is split into a doublet due to spin-coupling with the F substituent). This might be proved additionally by comparison with the 1H NMR spectrum of M2, which has a doublet signal in the same region, which is related to the proton at the next position to the F-atom (see the ESI, Fig. S1†). Indeed, the dithienosilole monomer M1 has the singlet signal in the region of 7 ppm (7.13 ppm, see the ESI, Fig. S2†), but we believe that in the case of M3 it has electron-withdrawing groups such as BTA and the corresponding signal moves into the low-field region. The 13C NMR of M2 and M3 shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†) also confirms the chemical structure of these monomers. Taking into account these considerations, we can conclude that in the spectrum of polymer P1 (and P2) the signals in the region of 8.0–8.5 ppm due to the dithienosilole unit and signals in the region of 7.5 ppm correspond to the F-BTA unit. All of the integral ratios of peak areas between the aromatic and aliphatic signals agree with the corresponding molecular structure of the polymers.

Indeed, 1H NMR spectra of the polymers P1 and P2 are very similar. But it is obviously because they are built from completely identical building blocks. We can conclude that this type of regioregularity (or non-regularity) of the polymers does not affect their NMR spectra (at least in this case). The spectrum of P1 (and P2) shows two signals of DTS-fragments (at 8.1 and 8.2 ppm). It is believed that they are related to two different fragments of DTS, differently positioned with respect to fluorine atoms. The complex structure of the signal of F-BTA moiety (in the range of 7.43 ppm) can be explained by the S⋯F contacts between DTS and BTA fragments. These contacts can partially prevent the internal rotation of the structural units and additionally contribute to the macromolecular order of the polymer chains in the bulk. We can suggest that some of these possible contacts are not realized so structurally non-equivalent H-atoms of the BTA-fragments can appear, which make the NMR spectra more complex.
The thermal properties of P1 and P2 were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DCS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements. TGA curves for P1 and P2 are shown in Fig. 3. P1 and P2 exhibit good thermal stability with 5% weight-loss temperature (Td) at 350 °C and 381° C, respectively under N2. They were thermally stable for applications in optoelectronic devices. The DSC curves of P1 and P2 displayed no phase transition in the range of 25–300 °C.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-visible absorption spectra of the P1 and P2 in chloroform solutions and in thin films are shown in Fig. 4 and the corresponding optical data are summarized in Table 1. Both polymers showed a strong absorption peak around 600 nm (molar extinction coefficient 3.4 × 105 and 2.45 × 105 mol−1 cm−1 for P1 and P2, respectively) originating from delocalized excitonic π–π* transitions of the conjugated polymer backbone. Interestingly, the regioregular P1 exhibited stronger absorption intensity than the random P2 which could be ascribed to vigorous π–π* transitions of the conjugated polymer chain. In dilute solutions, the main absorption band of the regioregular polymer P1 is bathochromically shifted by 15 nm and broadened to some extent in comparison to that of its random counterpart P2. This difference can be attributed to enhanced intermolecular π–π interactions resulting from the regioregular arrangement of the polymer main chain.16 In the solid-state absorption spectra these differences were even more pronounced. It was found that the absorption spectrum of P1 in the solid thin film has a stronger shoulder peak at 641 nm than those of random P2, indicating good intermolecular π–π* stacking of regioregular P1. This result clearly indicates that the structural regioregularity of the conjugated backbones in P1 copolymers can have a significant effect on their optical properties. The maximum absorption peak of P1 was at 592 and 578 nm for P2 with onset absorption wavelengths at 707 nm and 693 nm corresponding to optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of 1.75 eV and 1.79 eV, respectively.

The electrochemical properties of polymers were investigated to elucidate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. The cyclic voltammetry characteristics of these copolymers are illustrated in Fig. 5 and the relevant data are summarized in Table 1. HOMO and LUMO energy levels, electrochemical band gaps (Eeleg) are −5.40 eV/−3.40 eV and 2.00 eV for P1 and −5.31 eV/−3.33 eV and 1.96 eV for P2, respectively, according to the following equations of EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.40) eV and ELUMO = −e(Ered + 4.4) eV. Deep HOMO energy levels of P1 and P2 were desired for achieving a higher Voc in the PSCs and made these copolymers promising candidates for use as polymer donor materials. The LUMO levels of the polymers are higher than that of LUMO PC71BM (−4.1 eV) and the differences between the LUMO levels of the polymers and PC71BM are 0.79 eV and 0.86 eV for P1 and P2, respectively. Consequently, the electron transfer from the polymers (electron donor) to PC71BM (electron acceptor), which is the essential process for the charge separation of the excitons, can be allowed.14 The Eeleg values of P1 and P2 is larger (0.25–0.17 eV) than the Eoptg values. This discrepancy between the electrochemical and optical band gaps presumably resulted from the exciton binding energies of the polymers and/or the energy barrier at the interface between the polymer film and the electrode surface.15

In order to get information about the molecular stacking of the copolymers, X-ray diffraction patterns were measured for the regioregular P1 and random P2 films (Fig. 6). The copolymer P1 and P2 showed pronounced diffraction peaks at 2θ = 5.28° and 4.64°, respectively. These diffraction peaks corresponding to the lamellar d100 spacing which originated from the separation between the conjugated copolymer backbones and depending on the length as well as the orientation of side chains, were estimated to be 16.82 Å and 17.56 Å for regioregular P1 and random P2, respectively. In addition to the above, the stronger and wider diffraction peaks at 2θ = 22.48° and 22.04° for P1 and P2 films, respectively were observed in the XRD pattern, which was assigned to d010-spacing. The d010 spacing corresponds to the π–π stacking distance of the conjugated polymer backbones of 3.64 Å and 3.98 Å in the regioregular P1 and random P2, respectively. Moreover, the intensity of the d010 peak in the P1 is much stronger than that in P2. The XRD results clearly indicate that the degree of crystallinity in P1 is higher than that for P2.

Theoretical calculations
We have additionally performed a theoretical study on the P1 and P2 molecular structures within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT).
The initial geometry optimization calculations were performed employing the gradient corrected functional PBE17 of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof. The def-SVP basis set18 was used for all of the calculations. At this stage of the calculations, to increase the computational efficiency (without loss in accuracy), the resolution of the identity method19 was used for the treatment of the two-electron integrals. Subsequent geometry optimizations were further performed using the hybrid exchange–correlation functional B3LYP20 as well as Truhlar's meta-hybrid exchange–correlation functional M06,21 and the same basis set. Tight convergence criteria were placed for the SCF energy (up to 10−7 Eh) and the one-electron density (rms of the density matrix up to 10−8) as well as for the norm of the Cartesian gradient (residual forces both average and maximum smaller than 1.5 × 10−5 a.u.) and residual displacements (both average and maximum smaller than 6 × 10−5 a.u.). Solvent effects were included for chloroform (CF) using the integral equation formalism variant of the Polarizable Continuum Model (IEFPCM), as implemented in the Gaussian package.22
TD-DFT excited state calculations were performed to calculate the optical gaps of P1 and P2 using the same functionals and basis set on the corresponding ground state structures. The UV/Vis spectra were calculated using the B3LYP and M06 functionals. The first round of geometry optimizations was performed using the Turbomole package.23 All of the follow up calculations were performed using the Gaussian package.22
The first round of calculations was the geometry optimizations of the P1 and P2 structures. To increase the computational efficiency, the alkyl groups were truncated to ethyl groups. Vibrational analysis on the optimized structures did not reveal any vibrational modes with imaginary eigenfrequencies, i.e. the final optimized structures are true local (if not global) minima. The dimer was considered for the P2 so that it is properly analogous to the P1 structure. Both of the structures are nearly perfectly planar (not including the alkanes), in the gas phase as well as in the solvent. We have calculated the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and the optical gaps, defined here as the energetically lowest allowed vertical electronic excitation, employing the PBE, M06, and B3LYP functionals. In Table 2, in addition to the frontier orbitals’ energy levels, we also provide the optical gap the main contributions to the first excitation as well as the wavelength of the first excitation and of the excitations with the largest oscillator strengths.

In addition to the B3LYP functional we have also performed our calculations employing the M06 functional. The M06 meta-hybrid functional was chosen since it provides a level performance over transition types.24,25 We provide results using all three functionals, which can additionally be used for comparison with the literature.
The HOMO–LUMO (HL) gap of each structure calculated using the hybrid B3LYP functional is notably smaller, by ∼0.4 eV, than that using the meta-hybrid M06 functional, however, the calculated optical gaps are only marginally smaller, with a difference of ∼0.1 eV. In Table 2, we also provide the character of the first allowed excitations only for contributions larger than 4%. The first excitation, as calculated by each of the functional for all three structures, clearly exhibits a single-configuration character.
In Fig. 7, we have plotted the isosurfaces (isovalue = 0.02) of the HOMO and LUMO for both structures. In both cases the HOMO extends evenly over the main body. For the LUMO of each structure the delocalizations are also similar. The LUMO of P1 and P2 extends over the main structure but considerably more over the triazole group than in the case of the respective HOMOs. To quantify the contributions of the moieties to the frontier orbitals we have calculated the total and partial density of states (PDOS). The PDOSs for P1 and P2 are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). We partition all of the structures into the silolodithiophene (SDT) and fluorobenzotriazole (FBT) moieties. As expected, structures P1 and P2 have significant similarities on the delocalization of the frontier orbitals. The contributions of the SDT and FBT moieties to the HOMO of P1 are 71.3% and 28.5%, respectively, and for P2 at 70.4% and 29.4% respectively. For the LUMO of P1 the contributions of the SDT and FBT moieties are 50.0% and 48.4%, respectively, and for P2 at 50.2% and 48.2%, respectively. We note that, besides their similarities, structures P1 and P2 exhibit different dipole moments which is reflected in the difference in their solubility.

In Fig. 8, we show the UV/Visual absorption spectra of the P1 and P2 structures calculated at the TD-DFT/M06 level of theory, both accounting for solvent effects for CF and in the gas phase. The spectra have been produced by convoluting Gaussian functions with HWHM = 0.22 eV centered at the excitation wavenumbers. In Fig. S7 (see the ESI†) we also provide the corresponding spectra calculated using the B3LYP functional, which is in remarkable agreement with the spectra using the M06 functional, and only slightly underestimates in the long wavelength region (by ∼40 nm). The calculated absorption spectra of P1 and P2 are almost the same and they exhibit one main band with high absorbance, at ∼555 nm, as well as a low intensity peak at smaller wavelengths at ∼280 nm. The theoretical absorption spectra closely matched the experimentally observed absorption spectra.

Photovoltaic properties
In order to examine the influence of the structural regioregularity of conjugated copolymer backbones on the photovoltaic performance of solar cell devices, conventional BHJ polymer solar cells were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/PFN/Al. The active layers were spin coated from copolymer/PC71BM solutions prepared from either the CF or 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO, 3v%)–CF mixture. First of all, we have varied the weight ratio of the copolymer to PC71BM in chloroform solution and found that the best photovoltaic response was observed for the active layers with weight ratios of 1:2 for both copolymers and the photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 3. Without DIO the devices showed PCEs of 3.87% (Jsc = 8.58 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.98 V and FF = 0.46) and 2.53% (Jsc = 6.88 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.92 V and FF = 0.40) for P1 and P2, respectively. In order to improve the PCE further, we have employed the solvent additive method as reported in the literature for PSCs.26 We are only discussing the results on the devices based on the optimized active layer, i.e. the weight ratio of the copolymer to PC71BM is 1:2 and the concentration of DIO is 3v% in CF. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of devices based on P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM processed with DIO (3v%)/CF are shown in Fig. 9a and photovoltaic parameters are compiled in Table 3. It can be seen from Fig. 9a and Table 3 that a clear improvement in PCE was observed in going from random (P2) (5.33%) to the regioregular (P1) (7.66%) copolymer. The higher value of Voc for P1 as compared to P2 is related to the deeper HOMO level of P1 as compared to P2. Moreover, compared to the PSC with random P2, the improvement in PCE of the PSC with P1 may also result from enhanced values of Jsc and FF.

The IPCE spectra of the devices were investigated and shown in Fig. 9b. The IPCE spectra of the devices closely resemble the absorption spectra of the blended active layers. The response in the short wavelength region of 350–500 nm is attributed to the contribution of PC71BM.27 The IPCE spectra in the longer wavelength region (500–750 nm) correspond to the absorption of copolymers and are different for these devices. The values of IPCE for the device based on P1 are higher than that for P2, which also supports the higher value of Jsc for the former polymer than for the later one. The integrated values of Jsc from the IPCE spectra are about 12.86 mA cm−2 and 9.92 mA cm−2 for P1 and P2 based solar cells, respectively, confirming the accuracy of J–V characteristics of solar cells under illumination.
It is well known that the charge carrier mobility in the active layer is very important in polymer solar cells. In order to get information about the influence of the intermolecular interactions on the hole mobility of the active layers, we have prepared the hole only and electron only devices and measured the hole and electron mobilities in the active layers based on P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM films. The measured J–V characteristics of the hole and electron only devices are shown in Fig. 10 and charge carrier mobilities are estimated by fitting these curves with the space charge limited current model.28 The hole mobility values for P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM are 1.16 × 10−4 and 8.04 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The regioregular P1 showed an improved mobility compared to random P2. This may be attributed to the highly improved π–π stacking due to the structural regioregularity of conjugated copolymer backbones.29 This is also supported by the observed red-shift and clear vibronic shoulder in the absorption spectrum of P1 in a thin film in the longer wavelength region. Moreover, XRD data also clearly indicate that the improved hole mobility of regioregular P1 due to the high regioregularity of conjugated polymer chains and effective ordering between polymer chains may be the most likely reason for enhancement of PCE.30 The electron mobilities for P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM are about 2.56 × 10−4 and 2.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Therefore, the ratios of electron to hole mobilities are 2.19 and 3.00, for P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM based devices, respectively, indicating more balanced charge transport in the device based on P1:PC71BM as compared to P2:PC71BM, leading to a higher value of FF and PCE.

The nanoscale morphology of P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM thin films processed with DIO/CF solvent was investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and is shown in Fig. 11. It can be seen from Fig. 11 that both the active layers processed with DIO/CF exhibit nanoscale features, indicating fine phase separation of copolymers and PC71BM with DIO additive.31 The black domain is assigned to PC71BM aggregation because its ordered aggregation gives a relatively high electron density compared to polymer aggregation.32 The P1:PC71BM film has a more uniform morphology and better interpenetrating networks than the P2:PC71BM film. The P1:PC71BM layer showed a finer network of bright and dark regions with appropriate nanoscale phase separation between the copolymer P1 and the PC71BM phase, which is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport, resulting in improved Jsc, FF and PCE.

In order to get information about the charge generation in the devices based on P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM due to the different structures of copolymers, we measured the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of effective voltage (Veff) as shown in Fig. 12. The measured Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current density under illumination (100 mW cm−2) and in the dark, respectively. Veff is given as Veff = Vo − Vappl, where Vo is the compensation voltage at which Jph = 0 and Vappl is the applied voltage. It can be seen from Jph–Veff plots that at low Veff, the Jph increases linearly with Veff and tend to saturate at higher Veff in both the devices, at which the internal electric field is large enough to dissociate all the photogenerated excitons into free charge carriers. This voltage is also responsible to sweep out all free charge carriers towards the electrodes.33 We have observed that the Jph starts to saturate at lower Veff for P1:PC71BM as compared to P2:PC71BM, indicating that due to the regioregular nature of P1 with the enhanced intermolecular interactions, the low internal electric field in needed to sweep out the charge carriers in this device as compared to the P2 based device. We have estimated the probability of charge collection (Pc) of separated carriers using Pc = Jsc/Jphsat and the values of Pc are 0.86 and 0.80 for P1:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM based devices, respectively. The higher value of Pc for the P1:PC71BM device is attributed to the better nanoscale morphology and balanced charge transport.

We have estimated the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) from the slope of the J–V characteristics of the devices, under illumination, around the Voc and Jsc, respectively, and compiled them in Table 3. In general, the Rs of the organic solar cell is composed of the bulk resistance of the active layer and depends on the charge transportability within the active layer and the morphology of the active layer. It can be seen from Table 3 that the Rs of the device based on P1:PC71BM is lower than that for P2:PC71BM which may be attributed to the better morphology and balanced charge transport. The increase in Rsh is related to the decrease in leakage current and depends upon the intermolecular interaction (or electronic) coupling between the donor and acceptor materials in the active layer.
Conclusion
Two copolymers P1 (regioregular) and P2 (random) were successfully synthesized. Regioregular copolymer P1 showed a slightly lower optical bandgap (1.75 eV) and higher crystallinity compared to random copolymer P2. These copolymers were used as donor materials along with PC71BM as the acceptor for the fabrication of bulk heterojunction PSCs. After the optimization of active layers (weight ratio between copolymers and PC71BM and concentration of solvent additive), PSC based on P1 shows a conversion efficiency of 7.66% which is higher than that for the random copolymer P2 (5.33%). Improved photo-absorption and charge carriers mobility due to the high regioregularity of conjugated copolymers and efficient ordering of copolymer chains are most likely the cause of PSC energy conversion efficiency increasing. This study suggests that the P1 copolymer can achieve high PCE due to the increase in structural regioregularity of conjugated polymer chains. Although, both the active layers processed with DIO/CF show uniform nanoscale features however the P1:PC71BM film exhibits a more uniform morphology and better interpenetrating networks than the P2:PC71BM film, resulting in improved Jsc, FF and PCE. Moreover, the approach we have described here also provides an opportunity to further modulate the optical and electronic properties of conjugated copolymers through the use of two different donor units.
