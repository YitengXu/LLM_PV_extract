    , Accepted 16th August 2021First published on 19th August 2021AbstractMetal halide perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have emerged as some of the most promising candidates for next-generation high-resolution displays due to their wide color gamut, high color purity, and low-cost solution processability. After just a few years of research, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) have exceeded 20% for PeLEDs based on the vacuum evaporation of charge transport layers (CTLs) upon perovskite layers. The use of all-solution-processed deposition to produce PeLEDs could further simplify fabrication procedures, lower processing costs, and enhancing compatibility with flexible substrates. However, the EQEs do not exceed 7% for these PeLEDs because perovskites are sensitive to many solvents due to their ionic nature. Moreover, colloidal perovskite quantum dots (PeQDs) easily dissolve in polar and non-polar solvents because of their surface organic ligands. In this perspective, we first briefly introduce the crystal structures and intrinsic instability of metal halide perovskites making them unsuitable for solution-processed deposition, and then summarize recent advances relating to all-solution-processed PeLEDs. Finally, the challenges and outlooks for the future development of all-solution-processed PeLEDs are discussed.
1. Introduction
Metal halide perovskites have recently emerged as novel next-generation semiconductors that have been widely used in solar cells,1,2 photodetectors,3,4 lasing,5,6 and light-emitting diodes,7,8 due to their excellent optical and electrical properties, such as long exciton diffusion length,9,10 outstanding charge-carrier mobility,11 high color purity,12,13 near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY),14,15 and optical bandgap tunability.16,17 Since the first perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) operating at room temperature were reported by the Friend group in 2014,18 rapid progress has been made in device performances. For example, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) have been boosted from 0.76% and 0.1% for infrared and green PeLEDs, respectively, to greater than 20%19–22 through composition engineering, interface manipulation, and device structure optimization.23–26 Encouraged by these achievements, it is desired to develop fabrication technology with simple procedures and low manufacturing cost to facilitate the commercial application of PeLEDs. Therefore, all-solution-processed fabrication of PeLEDs, where all the functional layers can be deposited by solution processing, is the expected technique.
To date, during the fabrication of PeLEDs, almost all the charge transport layers (CTLs) above the perovskite emissive layers (EMLs) are deposited via a high-vacuum evaporation method, resulting in a time-consuming procedure with high production cost, limited device area, and low yield, which restricts commercial mass production that uses methods such as inkjet printing, screen printing, spray coating, and roll-to-roll processing, and thus inhibiting their popularization in displays and flat panel lighting. Compared with vacuum deposition technology, the all-solution process is simpler and less expensive, and thus is conducive to large-area and cost-effective fabrication.27,28 However, the choice of solvents for the CTLs above the EMLs is critical for the successful preparation for the all-solution-processed PeLEDs.27
Specifically, the orthogonal solvents used are usually adopted solutions based on non-polar or polar solvents to process the layers obtained from the solutions based on polar or non-polar solvents, and these should be employed to prevent the re-dissolving of the underlying EMLs so that complete EMLs/CTLs interfaces can be constructed.29,30 Unfortunately, because of the ionic characteristics of the perovskites, perovskite polycrystalline films are easily re-dissolved in polar solvents such as ethanol,31 leading to the formation of poor perovskite EML/CTL heterostructures. In addition, because the organic ligands on the surface of perovskite quantum dots (PeQDs) are easily dissolved in non-polar solvents,32 both polar and non-polar solvents for the upper CTLs can permeate into the underlying colloidal PeQD films and then damage them, which reduces device performance and stability. Fortunately, benefiting from perovskite material engineering and the manipulation of the CTLs above the EMLs, there has been progress in the creation of all-solution-processed PeLEDs. Currently, the EQE of all-solution-processed PeLEDs has been increased to 6.2%,33,34 with promising potential for next-generation high-definition and cost-effective displays as well as panel lighting.
With this perspective, we first briefly introduce the basic features of the metal halide perovskite materials, including three-dimensional (3D) perovskites, colloidal PeQDs, and quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskites from the aspects of the crystal structures and the instability to external factors such as thermal stress, ambient air, illumination, and electric field, as well as solvent. We then summarize the recent advances in the all-solution-processed PeLEDs that have been reported thus far in terms of the perovskite material engineering and the electron transport layer (ETL) manipulation strategies. Finally, the challenges and outlooks for the future development of the all-solution-processed PeLEDs are also discussed.
2. Crystal structures and stability of metal halide perovskites
The conventional lead halide perovskites present a 3D structure with a chemical formula of ABX3, where A and B are monovalent (e.g., Cs+, CH3NH3+ (MA+) or CH(NH2)2+ (FA+)) and divalent (e.g., Pb2+ or Sn2+) cations, respectively, and X denotes a halide or pseudohalide anion (e.g., Cl−, Br−, I−, or SCN−),35 as shown in Fig. 1a. One B cation and six X anions constitute a [BX6]4− octahedron, with the B cation located at the center. The 3D perovskite structure is composed of a series of corner-sharing [BX6]4− octahedra with A cations occupying the octahedral cavities to maintain the electroneutrality of the entire system.36 The formation of a stable 3D perovskite structure can be determined using the Goldschmidt tolerance factor: (1)and the octahedral factor: (2)where RA, RB, and RX denote the ionic radii of the A, B, and X ions, respectively, when all three ions are regarded as rigid spheres. Typical 3D perovskites have tolerance factors between 0.813 ≤ t ≤ 1.107, and an octahedral factor between 0.442 ≤ μ ≤ 0.895.37 Therefore, controlling the radii of the constituent ions is very important to achieve a stable cubic perovskite structure. In addition, zero-dimensional (0D) colloidal PeQDs are another type of perovskite with attractive luminous properties. Various organic capping ligands, such as oleic acid (OA) and oleylamine (OAm), bind to the surface of the PeQDs to maintain the monodispersity of PeQDs in the organic solvents and prevent their aggregation (Fig. 1b).36,38 Recently, layered perovskites with the general formula (RNH3)2An−1BnX3n+1, where R represents an aromatic or alkyl moiety (n = 1, pure 2D structure; n = ∞, 3D structure; and n = defined integer, quasi-2D layered structure), were fabricated by introducing large organic cations into 3D perovskites that do not fit into the octahedral cavities between the [BX6]4− octahedra (Fig. 1c).39,40

Because of the ionic and soft lattice nature with low formation energy, most metal halide perovskite materials undergo significant degradation under thermal stress, ambient air, illumination, and an electric field.37,41 The perovskite EMLs may experience annealing during fabrication and Joule heating during device operation, which can induce the structural transformation of perovskite lattices and hence the modification of their optical and electronic properties. For instance, MAPbI3 underwent a cubic-to-tetragonal phase transition at 330 K, and then transformed into the orthorhombic phase at 160 K, due to the change in the tilt angle of the [PbI6]4− octahedron compared to the pseudocubic framework of MA+ ions.42,43 Oxygen and water in ambient air can accelerate the degradation of the perovskite films during fabrication and device operation.44 Usually, the preparation of the perovskite films is carried out in a glove box filled with inert gases, such as nitrogen.
To confirm the effect of O2, Zhou et al. compared the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of MAPbI3−xClx-based perovskite devices stored in dry air and N2, and found that the PCE of the former deteriorated more rapidly than that of the latter.45 In the presence of humidity, even at relatively low levels (RH ≈ 10%), water diffuses quickly in perovskite films on the time-scale of seconds.46 Yang et al. showed that a MAPbI3 thin film with a deep brown color on glass decomposed into PbI2 and developed a bright yellow color after storage on the laboratory bench for 5 days (Fig. 1d).47 MABr and MAI easily dissociate under a 266 nm pump, which is evidenced by femtosecond pump–probe spectroscopy, implying that UV exposure inevitably accelerates the degradation of the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites.48 During device operation, ion migration is one of the main reasons for PeLED degradation. The migrating ions can accumulate at defect sites or at the interfaces with other layers under the electric field, causing the degradation of the perovskite layers.49Fig. 1e shows optical images of the MAPbI3 films without and with bias (0.5 V μm−1 for 6 min).50 Under 0.5 V μm−1 bias, a dark region appears on the anode side, representing a lower PL intensity resulting from ion accumulation-induced nonradiative recombination.
In the fabrication of all-solution-processed PeLEDs, due to the ionic and soft lattice nature, the perovskite materials are very sensitive to various solvents, which results in rapid decomposition of the perovskite films when polar and/or non-polar solvents are spin-coated on top of them, thereby deteriorating the device performance. It is a challenge to obtain complete perovskite film and CTL heterostructures in all-solution-processed PeLEDs. In the following section, strategies for building high-performance all-solution-processed PeLEDs will be discussed.
3. Strategies for improving the performance of all-solution-processed PeLEDs
In this section, we review recent advances in all-solution-processed PeLEDs and strategies for increasing the device performances in terms of perovskite material engineering. This includes surface ligand engineering and composition engineering, and ETL manipulation such as solvent engineering as well as interface dipole and work function (WF) adjustments.
3.1. Engineering of perovskite materials for all-solution-processed PeLEDs

3.1.1. Surface ligand engineering for PeQDs. 
To create PeQD films that are resistant to non-polar solvents, Wei et al.51 used conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which is a polymerizable molecule, as a surface ligand to passivate and stabilize PeQDs. Under photoexcitation, such as-synthesized PeQDs can be triggered to form an active radical. Then, the active radical can promote the initiation of the polymerization reaction and form polymerized CLA (poly-CLA) molecules (Fig. 2a). Fig. 2b shows the surface charge redistributions of the PbBr2-rich CsPbBr3 PeQDs capped with CLA and poly-CLA ligands. Such crosslinked poly-CLA ligands not only decrease the surface defect density of the PeQDs, but they also increase the binding energy between the poly-CLA ligands and PeQDs from 0.91 to 9.15 eV compared with the uncrosslinked CLA ligands due to the combination of tris-carboxylic groups and three surface-exposed Pb atoms, as well as van der Waals interaction force between the alkyl-rich branched chain and the surface of PeQDs. The increased binding energy leads to enhanced stability of the PeQDs.

(c) Photos of poly-CLA-capped CsPbBr3 QD films under UV light illumination before and after washing with CB, Tol, and Hex. (d) PL intensity versus time curves of CsPbBr3 QD films with uncrosslinked and crosslinked CLA ligands. (e) EQE versus luminance curves of devices based on poly-CLA-capped CsPbBr3 QDs with crosslinking times of 30, 60, 75, and 90 min (reprinted from ref. 51, © 2020, with permission from the American Chemical Society). 
As illustrated in Fig. 2d, the PL intensity of crosslinked poly-CLA-capped CsPbBr3 QD films remained at 67% of its initial intensity after immersion in water for 3 h, while that of the CsPbBr3 QD films with uncrosslinked CLA was quickly quenched in less than an hour. Moreover, due to the crosslinking of adjacent QDs induced by the poly-CLA, the CsPbBr3 QD films resisted washings with non-polar solvents, such as chlorobenzene (CB), toluene (Tol), and hexane (Hex). Compared with the unwashed poly-CLA-capped CsPbBr3 QD films with a PLQY of 30.6%, the poly-CLA-capped CsPbBr3 QD films washed with CB, Tol, and Hex still exhibit high PLQYs of 28.4, 31.2, and 30.8%, respectively (Fig. 2c).
Benefiting from the excellent resistance to non-polar solvents, a solution-processed PeLED was fabricated with an architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/poly(4-butylphenyl diphenylamine) (poly-TPD)/PeQDs/1,3,5-tris(1-phenyl-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)benzene (TPBi)/LiF/Al. Fig. 2e shows the EQE versus luminance curves of the all-solution-processed PeLEDs based on poly-CLA-capped CsPbBr3 QDs with crosslinking times of 30, 60, 75, and 90 min under photoexcitation, respectively, and the highest EQE for CsPbI3-based devices was 2.67%.


3.1.2. Composition engineering for perovskite materials. 
To increase the stability of colloidal CsPbBr3 PeQDs so that they resist solvents, Zhao and co-workers fabricated all-inorganic heterostructured Zn-doped CsPbBr3/ZnS PeQDs by a hot injection method.52 Such a heterojunction between the Zn-doped CsPbBr3 PeQDs and the ZnS nanocluster not only results in maintaining the semiconducting properties of PeQDs, but also simultaneously enhances their optical properties and stability due to the passivation of the surface defects of PeQDs by ZnS nanoclusters and Zn2+ doping. To compare the stability of the as-synthesized pure CsPbBr3, Zn-doped CsPbBr3, and Zn-doped CsPbBr3/ZnS QDs, they studied the relative PL intensities of the three types of PeQDs films as a function of different temperatures and time under laser irradiation. As the temperature increased, the relative PL intensity of the Zn-doped CsPbBr3/ZnS heterostructure PeQD film maintained greater than 80% of its initial intensity at 140 °C, while the relative PL intensities of the pure CsPbBr3 and Zn-doped CsPbBr3 PeQD films were all below 60% of their initial intensities at the same temperatures. In addition, under the irradiation of a 405 nm, 40 W laser for 60 min, the relative PL intensity of pure CsPbBr3 QD film was less than 20% of its initial value, while that of the Zn-doped CsPbBr3/ZnS PeQD film remained at 78%. As a result, they fabricated an all-inorganic, all-solution-processed PeLED with a device structure of ITO/p-NiO NPs/Zn-doped CsPbBr3/ZnS QDs/n-ZnO NPs/Ag using inorganic n-ZnO and p-NiO nanoparticles as electron and hole transport materials, respectively. A high EQE of 4.8% for the all-solution-processed PeLED based on Zn-doped CsPbBr3/ZnS PeQD film was achieved.
The operation lifetime (denoted as T50: the operational time where half of the initial luminance is decayed under constant conditions) of the PeLEDs based on Zn-doped CsPbBr3/ZnS PeQD films is 84 min under a driving voltage of 4.0 V. In addition, Bi et al.34 prepared CsPbI3 nanowire clusters with remarkable structural and environmental stability as well as ultralow trap density by a large-scale ligand-assisted reprecipitation method using non-polar solvent, which showed a PL emission peak at 600 nm with a PLQY of up to 91%. Based on these stable and efficient perovskite nanowire clusters, they demonstrated the currently most efficient all-solution-processed red PeLEDs with a maximum EQE of 6.2%.

3.2. ETL manipulation for all-solution-processed PeLEDs

3.2.1. Solvent engineering of ETLs. 
Selecting orthogonal solvents to preserve the complete EML/CTL multilayer structure is also important for constructing high-performance, solution-processed PeLEDs. Because fluorous (including per-fluorinated or highly fluorinated) liquid is usually benign to PeQDs, Zhang et al.53 employed hydrofluoroether solvents (such as HFE 7100, Fig. 3a) as orthogonal solvents to disperse surface-modified ZnO nanoparticles for solution-processed ETL and the CsPbBr3 PeQDs/ETL heterostructure. To investigate the influence of solvents on CsPbBr3 PeQD films, they treated CsPbBr3 PeQD spin-coated glass substrates with different solvents, such as non-polar solvents (toluene/hexane), polar solvents (butanol/ethanol), and hydrofluoroethers (Fig. 3b). The CsPbBr3 PeQD films treated with toluene, hexane, butanol, and ethanol were significantly destroyed through re-dissolving and dissolution, respectively, while the CsPbBr3 PeQD films treated with hydrofluoroethers were preserved and exhibited almost unchanged PL intensity. As a result, they demonstrated an efficient all-solution-processed PeLED with an architecture as shown in Fig. 3c. The PeLED exhibited a maximum current efficiency (CE) of 0.72 cd A−1, a peak EQE of 0.37% (Fig. 3d), and a T50 of 18 min under a continuous bias of 4 V.

(g) CE versus current density curves of PeLEDs based on solution-processed TPBi dissolved in Tol, CB, MeOAc, EtOAc, or PrOAc (reprinted from ref. 54, © 2018, with permission from the American Chemical Society). 
Different solvents can also significantly influence the underlying perovskite EMLs, and thus, solution-processed PeLED performance. Yang et al.54 systematically compared and analyzed the effects of Tol, CB, and acetate solvents such as methyl acetate (MeOAc), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), propyl acetate (PrOAc), and butyl acetate (BuOAc) on the PeQD films. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. 3e) of the Tol- and CB-treated PeQD films display large particle sizes and discontinuous film morphologies with a large root mean square (RMS) roughness of 4.56 and 3.78 nm, respectively, due to the dissolution of PeQDs and then re-aggregation to form larger particles. In contrast, the RMS roughness of the PeQD films treated with MeOAc, EtOAc, PrOAc, and BuOAc are 3.09, 3.18, 3.23, and 3.20 nm, respectively, which exhibit slight changes for the film morphologies.
Such low RMS roughness indicates the negligible influence of MeOAc, EtOAc, PrOAc, and BuOAc solvents on PeQD films, due to their medium polarity compared with the common polar and non-polar solvents, and thus, they are benign to PeQDs so that complete PeQD films can be preserved. Then, they fabricated all-solution-processed PeLEDs with an architecture as shown in Fig. 3f. Fig. 3g exhibits the CE versus current density curves of the all-solution-processed PeLEDs, with TPBi dissolved in Tol, CB, MeOAc, EtOAc, and PrOAc solvents. Because of the low solubility of TPBi in PrOAc and BuOAc, it is difficult to prepare continuous TPBi layers on the PeQD films, leading to low CEs. The all-solution-processed PeLEDs based on TPBi dissolved in MeOAc and EtOAc show a CE of 3.26 and 2.51 cd A−1, respectively.


3.2.2. Dipole and WF adjustments of ETLs. 
Because of the large barrier height between conventional TPBi ETLs and Al electrodes as well as the low solubility of TPBi in the organic solvents, it is urgent to discover new electron transport materials with the synergistic effects of high solubility in solvent and low barrier height with an Al electrode. Our group55 employed conjugated amino-alkyl-substituted polyfluorene poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) as an electron transport material to fabricate efficient all-solution-processed PeLEDs with a structure as shown in Fig. 4a. PFN can be dissolved in non-polar solvent CB, which prevents the polycrystalline CsPbBr3 films from being destroyed. Moreover, the barrier for the electron injection from the cathode Al with high WF was significantly decreased, due to an interface dipole formed from the strong interaction and the alignment of the amino group of PFN on the Al surface (Fig. 4b). A small amount of TPBi was further incorporated in PFN solution to increase the electron mobility of PFN, leading to more balanced charge injection in EMLs. In addition, the doping of TPBi can also reduce the WF difference between the CsPbBr3 and PFN films, resulting in a decreased charge transfer. As a result, an all-solution-processed PeLED based on 17.5 wt% TPBi-doped PFN exhibited a maximum EQE of 3.19%, corresponding to a CE of 10.41 cd A−1 (Fig. 4c) and a T50 of 115 min under an initial luminance of 100 cd m−2.

KGaA, Weinheim). (d) The Fermi level regions of the TPBi, PEI-, and PFN′-doped TPBi layers.

KGaA, Weinheim). 
In addition, Kim et al.56 used polyethylenimine (PEI)- or poly[9,9-dioctyl-9′,9′-bis[3-(trimethylammonio)propyl][2,2′-bi-9H-fluorene]-7,7′-diyl] (PFN′)-doped TPBi as the solution-processed ETLs to construct all-solution-processed PeLEDs. Compared with pure TPBi (T100) ETL, the PEI- and PFN′-doped TPBi (denoted as T95_PEI5 and T95_PFN5, respectively) ETLs have a higher surface WF (Fig. 4d), and thus deeper highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which is conducive to electron injection and hole blocking, resulting in balanced carrier injection in the EML of PeLEDs. Combining the high WF and deep HOMO with the passivation effects of PEI and PFN′ between the rough surface of the EML and the cathode, the all-solution-processed PeLEDs based on PEI- and PFN′-doped TPBi with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/MAPbBr3–polymer/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)/T100 (or T95_PEI5 or T95_PFN5)/Ag exhibited maximum CEs of 1.14 cd A−1 and 1.52 cd A−1, respectively (Fig. 4e).
In addition, the lifetimes of the PeLEDs based on the T95_PEI5 and T95_PFN5 were also longer than that of the PeLEDs based on the T100 (Fig. 4f), due to the passivation of the T95_PEI5 and T95_PFN5. Moreover, Qasim et al.33 employed n-type Ca-doped ZnO (CZO) nanoparticles as the ETL during the fabrication of all-solution-processed PeLEDs. The band structure of ZnO was tailored by doping Ca ions, which created a cascade of the conduction energy levels from cathode to perovskite EML. Therefore, the conductivity and carrier mobility of the CZO ETL were significantly enhanced, which enables the controlled injection of electrons. As a result, they achieved multicolor all-solution-processed PeLEDs with EQEs of 5.8%, 4.2%, and 6.2% for red (635 nm), yellow (580 nm), and green (540 nm) emission, respectively. Table 1 summarizes the EL performances of the all-solution-processed PeLEDs that have been recently reported.

4. Challenges and outlooks
Compared with the vacuum evaporation methods, solution-processed technology is superior because enlarging the size of the emission area for the fabrication of PeLEDs is inexpensive, and processing is facile. Despite the increase in the EQEs of the all-solution-processed PeLEDs to 6.2%,33,34 two main challenges still remain for the further development of the all-solution-processed PeLEDs. The intolerance of the EMLs to polar solvents, such as ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile, is an obstacle that needs to be overcome. Because of the ionic nature of the perovskite materials, the perovskite polycrystalline film morphology, including the surface RMS roughness and the crystallinity, as well as film's optical properties, can be destroyed by the polar solvents that dissolve the upper charge transport materials during the upper CTL deposition process. It is also a challenge to find more suitable orthogonal solvents for the PeQD films, because of the non-polar property of the capped organic ligands on the PeQD surfaces. Therefore, using crosslinked ligands51 or covering PeQDs with a shell52 is a viable method to create PeQDs resistant to polar and/or non-polar solvents.
Obtaining the optimal upper solution-processed CTL that will form a complete perovskite EML/CTL heterostructure and also has a low barrier between the CTL and the metal electrode for the electron injection is another significant challenge in achieving highly efficient all-solution-processed PeLEDs. Because of conventional electron transport material, TPBi has limited solubility in organic solvents and large barriers due to the Al electrode,54 and therefore, it is essential to discover other electron transport materials that have high solubility in organic solvents and can form dipoles in the interface between the ETLs and the metal electrodes to reduce the electron injection barrier.
Moreover, the all-solution-processed methods can also be compatible with the inkjet printing technique that can realize high-density pixelated PeLEDs.62,63 Inkjet printing is a flexible non-contact and maskless solution-patterning technique and can minimize the waste of functional materials.64 To produce all-solution-processed inkjet-printed PeLEDs, there are still challenges in obtaining inks that dissolve all the perovskite precursors and suppress the coffee-stain effect during the inkjet printing process. The coffee-stain effect usually causes uneven thickness and poor crystallization of the printed perovskite films due to the rheological and solvent evaporation characteristics of the printing perovskite precursor droplets such as capillary force and Marangoni flow,62 which deteriorate the performance of the resulting inkjet-printed PeLEDs. Combining the all-solution-processed strategy with the inkjet printing technique, it is likely that large-area, fine-patterned, high-efficiency, and high-density light-emitting pixel arrays will be achieved that can be applied to information displays.
5. Conclusions
The efficiencies of all-solution-processed PeLEDs are moderate compared with those of PeLEDs based on vacuum-evaporated CTLs above perovskite EMLs. There is still room for improvement in the performances of all-solution-processed PeLEDs. In this perspective, we briefly introduced some of the fundamental properties of metal halide perovskites, their ionic nature with a soft lattice, which lead to difficulties in the construction of all-solution-processed PeLEDs. We summarize some main strategies to fabricate and enhance the performances of all-solution-processed PeLEDs from the aspects of the engineering of perovskite materials and the manipulation of the ETLs. Finally, we propose two challenges facing all-solution-processed PeLEDs in terms of perovskite material engineering and ETL manipulation. The prospect of the development of all-solution-processed PeLEDs using inkjet printing techniques is proposed.
