This review article highlights the gradual emergence of diverse molecular design principles to realize exceptionally electron deficient arylenediimide molecules. Interestingly, non-conventional electron withdrawing substituents allow the realization of some of the strongest electron acceptors known from this class of molecules. Thus, an enthralling and exceptionally close race to garner the top position within the electron deficient molecules unfolds, which has immense implications with regard to stability and potential applications.Sharvan KumarSharvan Kumar was born in Allahabad, India, in 1988.

Introduction
Organic redox-active π-conjugated molecules with strong electron-accepting properties can be important building blocks to cater to the global demand for new generation of renewable energy sources.1 In this context, there has been a persistent endeavour to develop efficient organic n-type semiconductors to realize large-area, flexible electronics and stable optoelectronic devices, for example, organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs) and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).2 Although there have been significant advances towards enhancing the charge mobility of n-/p-type semiconductors, a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental relationship between the molecular structure and its electronic and physicochemical properties would be required for replacing the currently utilized metal and silicon-based electronic components in the existing devices.3 To this end, a lot of work has been done on multi-centred hole-transporting materials and p-type semiconductors have seen a significant improvement in performance over the last few years.4 However, the development of n-type materials with high mobility and stability under ambient conditions remains a major challenge for the realization of complementary circuits. This is because the synthesis of molecules with very low-lying LUMO energy levels results in instability and high reactivity under ambient conditions.5
de Leeuw and co-workers have explained the instability of n-type organic molecules to ambient conditions on the basis of kinetic barriers for the reaction of the charge carrying electron with common reactive species like H2O and O2.6a On the basis of their solution-phase redox potentials, it was proposed that to possess water stability, molecules should have reduction potential more positive than −0.658 V, while for oxygen stability, first reduction potential should be more positive than +0.571 V vs. the saturated calomel electrode (SCE). However, with some apt molecular designing ambient-stable n-type semiconductor devices have been fabricated with a LUMO level of −4.0 eV, which is at significantly higher potential than that estimated by de Leeuw.6b–e On the other hand, the significant challenges in the synthesis and isolation of molecules with the LUMO level lower than −4.5 eV have been confirmed by the groups of Diederich and Chi et al.7,25 In certain cases, molecules having such low-lying LUMO energy levels are even reactive to the glass surface rendering their isolation extremely difficult.
Traditionally, perfluoro groups, halogen atoms, cyanide and nitro groups have been utilized as electron withdrawing substituents and poly-aromatic hydrocarbons substituted with such groups showed enhanced electron accepting properties, and strong charge mobility.8
Among the inherently electron deficient π-acceptors, arylenediimide based π-scaffolds have been widely investigated as semiconductors, radical ion-based sensor probes, charge transporting materials, solar cells, in energy storage and in catalysis of reactions.9,10 Out of the arylenediimides, naphthalenediimides (NDI)11 and perylenediimides (PDI)12 have been established as promising electronic materials because of their large electron deficient π-surfaces and ability to form self-assembled structures. It is to be noted that that these compounds are also termed naphthalene bisimides (NBIs) and perylene bisimides (PBIs), which is the short form for naphthalene and perylene bis(dicarboximide). The energy of the frontier molecular orbital levels (HOMO and LUMO) of these diimides can be easily tuned via diverse chemical functionalization at the core- and axial-positions.13 The introduction of electron withdrawing groups at the core-position significantly lowers down the LUMO level, which not only enhance the stability in the presence of ambient impurities H2O and O2 but also improve the charge injection at the electrode.14
The aim of this review article is to highlight the gradual emergence of diverse molecular design principles that have led to the realization of exceptionally strong arylenediimide-based electron acceptors. A host of new electron withdrawing substituents have been conjugated with the arylenediimides, which has significantly expanded the tool-box available to synthetic chemists enabling the engineering of molecules with remarkably low-lying LUMO levels as well as stability. As a result, a fierce race to attain the lowest LUMO is currently on, and is fascinating to see how it unfolds through this review article. We also consider some recent versatile applications that emanate from the electron deficiency of arylenediimides.
Naphthalenediimides (NDIs)
The NDI π-scaffold is one of the most extensively studied organic electron deficient system with excellent thermal, light and air stability.9,11 Its inherently electron deficient nature is exemplified by the low-lying LUMO energy level and high quadrupole moment. Along with this, the ease of functionalization and planar π-framework has led to the realization of excellent charge-transfer based donor–acceptor assemblies, promising n-type semiconductors, advanced opto-electronic materials and applications in photovoltaic devices.9–11 This π-scaffold has also been widely investigated towards the understanding of anion–π interactions, anion transport and catalysis.9d In these studies, the diverse role of the naphthalene π-unit and the imide region in forming weak supramolecular interactions becomes clearly evident. Thus from the diversity as well as complexity of molecular design and supramolecular properties a massive array of rich NDI-based chemistry has emanated over the past few decades. The diversity in design originates from the ease of functionalization at various possible sites of the NDI π-scaffold, namely the axial, core, shoulder10c and also the direct fusion10d,e at the imide carbonyl groups. The opto-electronic properties of the NDI π-scaffold can be maximally modulated via the core-substitution at the naphthalene unit or by direct fusion at the imide carbonyl groups. On the other hand, axial substitution results in only minimal modulation of the opto-electronic properties of the NDI π-scaffold.
In a testimony to its electron acceptor properties, the NDI π-scaffold shows two successive reversible reduction peaks corresponding to the generation of the radical anion and dianion. These one- or two-electron reduced systems feature distinct optical absorption bands in the UV-Vis-NIR region and as such provide a straightforward route to probe the electron transfer (ET) processes by steady-state absorption spectroscopy. In general, the LUMO energy level is estimated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) or other sophisticated electrochemical techniques like differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). In this review article, we delve into the diverse NDI π-scaffolds that have been predominantly synthesized to tune their electron deficient nature for various applications. We have systematically classified the NDI π-scaffolds based on the axial- (Chart 1) and core-substitution (Charts 1–3). A comprehensive list of LUMO energy levels and the λabsmax of electron deficient NDIs is enlisted in Tables 1–4. The table constitutes two LUMO values, one which is directly obtained from the respective literature and the second is a recalculated LUMO level, assuming ELUMO = [−5.1(Fc) − E1R(Fc)] eV against vacuum. This is in order to have a fair comparison of the LUMO energy levels, although the variation in LUMO values would exist due to the changes in the polarity of the solvent, different electrolytes and their associated purity as well as several other external factors that contribute to the electrochemical study.

Axially-substituted NDIs
Since the axial substituents are predominantly decoupled at the nitrogen atom of the imide group, the substitution at this position effects the frontier orbitals of NDI only to a small extent.18 However, the effect of substituted alkyl/aryl groups on the LUMO level of NDIs cannot be overlooked. Importantly, the role of fluorinated alkyl groups at the axial positions in bettering the electron charge mobility of NDIs is well documented.10b In the NDI molecules (1–12), lowering of the LUMO levels on going from alkyl to aryl axial-substituents is quite evident (Chart 1 and Table 1). NDI 1 having n-pentyl as the substituent displays two reversible reduction potentials at −1.13 V and −1.53 V against Fc/Fc+ corresponding to NDI˙− and NDI2−, respectively, corresponding to a LUMO energy level of −3.97 eV.15 Expectedly, in 2 with n-dodecyl substituents the LUMO level remains almost unchanged at −3.99 eV.16 On substitution with aryl groups i.e. 4-tert-butyl benzene, the LUMO level of 3 was found to be −4.12 eV,1a while in 4 the LUMO level reduces to −4.24 eV, as a result of the pyridine rings. The LUMO level further reduces to −4.37 eV in 5 due to the electron withdrawing 2,4-diiodo-4-nitro-benzene groups, which is ∼400 meV lower than 1.17 Furthermore, molecules 6–10 reported by our group displayed systematic lowering of the LUMO levels upon going from benzyl to aryl hydrazimide rings.18a NDI 8 having hydrazimide rings at the axial position showed a LUMO level of −4.25 eV, while 9 and 10 having electron withdrawing substituents like CF3/F in the hydrazimide rings exhibited LUMO levels of −4.31 eV and −4.32 eV, respectively. We successfully applied a single electron transfer (SET) driven reaction from CN− to generate the intensely brown coloured NDI radical anion (NDI˙−). This ET reaction was found to be more selective with CN− compared to other basic anions like F−, OAc−, and H2PO4−. The signature absorption bands covering the UV-Vis-NIR region provided multiple channels to probe the anion driven ET reaction. Prior to this, we had utilized a SET reaction to NDI to differentiate colorimetrically a host of primary, secondary and tertiary amines.18b Subsequent to these studies, Saha and co-workers reported anion–π assisted F− driven ET to 4 and 5, while it was not tested for the CN− anion.17a,b Recently, in an important investigation, Gabbaï and co-workers have shown from detailed spectroscopic evidence as well as from the isolation of the single crystals of NDI˙− that the deprotonated solvent can act as the one electron reducing agent rather than the F− anion.17c
Molecule 11 having pendant dicationic alkyl chains at the axial positions could be bound strongly in the macrocyclic cavity of cucurbituril[7] (CB[7]), which drastically lowers the LUMO level of supramolecularly bound NDI (12) by 470 meV.
Thus supramolecular binding facilitates lowering of the LUMO energy level as well as the greater stabilization of the NDI˙− in the host–guest complex (12).19
Recently, Seferos et al. have reported a series of thionated NDI molecules (13–16) with n-alkyl chains at the axial positions.16 With systematic substitution of the imide carbonyl O atom of the NDI by S atoms, the LUMO level gradually decreases along with a concomitant red-shift in the absorption λmax as well as the enhanced electron mobility. Thus, in molecule 13 with one S atom the LUMO level decreases by 190 meV compared to the native NDI 2 to −4.18 eV. In molecule 14 with two S atoms substituted in a syn-manner, the LUMO was found to be significantly lowered to −4.31 eV, while when substituted in an anti-manner (15) showed almost an unchanged LUMO of −4.30 eV. In the NDI 16 with three S atoms the LUMO level further lowered to −4.45 eV. This huge shift in the LUMO energy level is possibly due to the vacant diffused orbitals of the S atom. Segura et al. reported a thiophene derivative of NDI 17, fused directly at the imide positions with a LUMO of −4.13 eV, which was found to exhibit organic field effect transistor properties.20 Therefore, amongst these classes of molecules, the substitution of the imide carbonyl O atom by the S atom looks to be highly promising towards generating highly electron deficient molecules with the LUMO almost attaining the attractive level of −4.5 eV. Also, the supramolecular wrapping of the pendant axial groups of the NDI looks to be an impressive method to enhance the electron deficiency and reach a LUMO level of −4.8 eV in aqueous solution.
Core-substituted NDIs

Halogenated and cyanated NDIs. 
The core-substitution with electron withdrawing groups at the naphthalene unit of the NDI π-scaffold provides significant opportunity to design a new class of highly electron deficient systems. A range of aromatic nucleophilic substitution (ArSN) and coupling reactions have been developed at the NDI-core. In particular, the successful bis- and tetra-bromination at the NDI-core by the Würthner group opened up a plethora of synthetic opportunities.21a,b Core-halogenation of the NDI molecule with F/Cl/Br atoms resulted in a new class of electron deficient NDI molecules (18–21). The introduction of two fluorine atoms at the NDI-core in 1821c generates a LUMO of −4.10 eV, while in 20, the two bromine atoms lowers the LUMO to −4.28 eV, which is 180 meV lower than that of 18.22 Interestingly, the LUMO level of di-fluoro NDI 19 with fluorinated alkyl chains further lowers the LUMO level to −4.27 eV, which is 170 meV lower than 18 clearly demonstrating the cumulative effect of the electron withdrawing core and axial groups.
On the other hand, di-chloro NDI 21,23 with fluorinated alkyl chains showed a LUMO level of −4.31 eV. On comparison of these LUMO values and also considering the effect of axial groups it can be concluded that on going from fluoro to chloro to bromo the LUMO energy level decreases substantially, which suggests that diffused orbitals of the larger halogen atoms facilitate lowering of the LUMO energy level by stabilizing the reduced states of the corresponding NDIs. The core-substituted mono-cyano NDI 22 with n-alkyl chains showed a LUMO of −4.48 eV, while the introduction of two cyano groups (23) results in a significant lowering of the LUMO to −4.78 eV.13b In NDI 24 the LUMO was found to be −4.71 eV as a result of the diisopropyl aryl groups. Apart from their highly electron deficient nature, their absorption is red-shifted up to ∼407 nm.24 All these low-lying LUMO molecules were found to be air stable and have been extensively used as n-type semiconductors. NDI 25,25 with four bromine atoms at the core and axially substituted n-alkyl chains, showed a LUMO of −4.21 eV, while substitution with four fluorine atoms at the NDI-core (26)21 results in a LUMO of −4.15 eV. NDI 27 with four chlorine atoms at the core and axially substituted fluorinated alkyl chains showed a LUMO of −4.44 eV. Molecule 28 having mono-cyano groups and three bromine atoms at the NDI-core showed a LUMO of −4.44 eV, while 29 with two cyano groups and two bromine atoms resulted in a LUMO of −4.65 eV.25 All these compounds were successfully applied as n-type OFETs.23
The introduction of a diazacene ring at the NDI-core and halogen atoms or cyano groups or a combination thereof (30–34) make them highly electron deficient and smart molecular materials for n-type OFETs. NDI 30, substituted with two bromine atoms at the naphthalene ring along with the diazacene ring showed a LUMO of −4.50 eV. Molecule 31 having one bromine atom and one cyano group at the naphthalene ring along with the azacene ring showed an attractively low-lying LUMO of −4.70 eV, while 32 with two cyano groups and the diazacene ring displays a further lowering of the LUMO level to −4.84 eV, respectively.26 NDI 33 having two fluorine atoms and the azacene ring produced a LUMO of −4.57 eV, while NDI 34 with two fluorine atoms and cyano substituted diazacene showed an attractive LUMO of −4.84 eV.21 Therefore, the incorporation of the diazacene ring and the combination of halogen/cyano groups at the naphthalene core can present highly attractive electron acceptors with remarkably low-lying LUMO levels.

Sulfide, sulfoxide and sulfone at the NDI-core
Matile et al. have extensively studied the sulfur chemistry at the NDI core as redox-active materials. This group has established that the introduction of one or more aryl/alkyl sulfide at the NDI-core increases the LUMO level compared to the native NDI, due to the sulfide-based electron donor groups. On incorporation of fluorinated aryl sulfides the LUMO level decreases compared to the native NDI, which further decreases in a significant manner on oxidation of the sulfide to sulfoxide and to sulfone by meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (mCPBA). The λmax of the NDI-sulfoxides and NDI-sulfones significantly blue-shifts compared to the NDI-sulfides. The mono-arylsulfide NDI, 35 showed a LUMO of −3.99 eV, while the LUMO was found to be slightly lowered to −4.06 eV upon introduction of fluorinated arylsulfide (36) (Chart 2 and Table 2). On oxidation of these sulfides to sulfoxides the LUMO level was found to reduce to −4.18 (37) and −4.23 eV (38), while oxidation to the corresponding sulfone results in a LUMO of −4.28 eV (39) and −4.37 eV (40), respectively, as a result of the strong electron withdrawing nature of the sulfone group.27
Molecules 41 and 42 with two alkyl sulfide groups at the NDI-core showed a LUMO of −3.92 and −4.02 eV, respectively. The oxidation of one of the sulfide groups to sulfoxide in 43 decreases the LUMO to −4.09 eV, while the oxidation of both the sulfides to sulfoxides in 44 decreases the LUMO to −4.31 eV. Furthermore, the oxidation of one sulfoxide to sulfone in 45 and both the sulfoxides to sulfones in 46 results in a LUMO of −4.40 eV and −4.52 eV, respectively.1a NDI 47 and 48, with alkyl chains at the axial positions and two aryl sulfides and fluorinated arylsulfide at the NDI core respectively, showed the LUMO of −3.96 and −4.13 eV. On the oxidation of both the sulfide groups of 47 and 48 to sulfoxides (49 and 50) and then to sulfones (53 and 54), the corresponding LUMO levels reduce to −4.35, −4.45, −4.56 and −4.72 eV, respectively. NDI 51 and 52 containing one arylsulfoxide and one arylsulfone group demonstrated a LUMO of −4.44 and −4.60 eV, respectively.27 In 52, the cumulative effect of the fluorinated aryl rings along with the sulphoxide and sulfone groups can be seen in increasing the electron deficiency of the NDI ring. The tetra-alkylsulfide NDI (55) showed a LUMO of −3.96 eV, while on oxidation to 56 the LUMO significantly reduced to −4.41 eV and further decreased to −4.74 eV in the case of the tetra-sulfone (57). This molecule with its exceptionally low-lying LUMO energy level was termed to be a super-π-acid.28
Arylation and alkynylation of the NDI-core
The introduction of two or four aryl groups at the NDI core results in a slight increment in the LUMO energy level compared to the native NDI. Electron withdrawing groups in the aryl rings make the NDI electron deficient. NDI 58 with two para-F benzene rings at the NDI-core results in a LUMO of −4.12 eV. On the other hand, –CHO groups at the para-positions (60) decrease the LUMO by 70 meV compared to 58 (Chart 3 and Table 3). The introduction of ortho-CHO aryl groups at the NDI-core (59) significantly reduces the LUMO to −4.42 eV compared to 60.29 On introduction of CF3 groups at the meta- and para-positions of the aryl rings conjugated to the NDI-core (61), the LUMO is found to be −4.18 eV. NDI 63, having diisopropyl aryl groups at the axial positions and two para-cyano benzene rings at the NDI core showed a LUMO of −4.27 eV.24 This clearly indicates that a long range electronic communication exists between the electron withdrawing groups at the ortho-/para-positions of the phenyl rings and the NDI π-scaffold. NDI 64 having tetra-aryl substitution showed a LUMO of −3.91 eV, and increased to −3.84 eV with para-OMe substituted tetra-aryl groups (65).30 Electron withdrawing cyano groups at the para-positions of 66 reduces the LUMO level to −4.18 eV.30 On the other hand, NDI 71 and 72 having bis-terpyridine groups exhibited a LUMO of −4.14 eV and −4.16 eV, respectively. Both the terpyridine substituted NDI molecules form metallo polymers via the formation of complexes with Co2+, Fe2+ and Ru2+ metal ions.32 Bis-arylalkynylated NDI 62 showed a LUMO of −4.22 eV, while NDI 69 having bis-pyridine groups conjugated through the alkyne π-linkers showed a LUMO of −4.29 eV. Replacement of the pyridine rings with thiophene groups (70) slightly increases the LUMO to −4.19 eV.24,31 Likewise, the LUMO of tetra-arylalkynylated NDI 67 was found to be −4.17 eV. On replacement of the aryl group by SiMe3 (68) the LUMO was found to be −4.13 eV. These molecules were successfully applied as n-type semiconductors.30 In particular, the extended conjugation in 67 results in large red-shifts in λmax to 535 nm in dichloromethane. Wang et al. have reported the one-pot synthesis of tetracene NDIs (73–75)33 following double cross coupling reaction protocols. Interestingly, these have absorption extending to the NIR region. The LUMO was found to be −4.28 eV for 73, which decreases by 110 meV to −4.39 eV when the alkyl imide was replaced by fluorinated imide in 74. The LUMO energy level of 75 having octahydrotetracene diimide remained unchanged (−4.28 eV) as compared to 73 having ethyl substituted tetracenediimide. Marder et al. have reported the synthesis of dicyanovinyl NDI (76) and dialdehyde NDI (77).34 The LUMO levels of these compounds were found to be −4.57 eV and −4.38, respectively, confirming their highly electron deficient nature. The LUMO of bis-trifluoromethane substituted NDI, 7835 was found to be −4.57 eV. Tetrathiophene substituted NDI 79 showed a LUMO level of −4.36 eV. On increasing the number of thiophenes to eight (80) the LUMO slightly decreases to −4.38 eV, and the LUMO further reduces to −4.40 eV when linked with twelve thiophene groups (81). Importantly, the λmax of these compounds systematically red-shifts to 514, 623 and 664 nm, respectively, and highlights their improved opto-electronic properties.36
Phosphonium and pyridinium groups at the NDI-core
We recently reported the successful integration of highly Lewis acidic bis-phosphonium groups at the NDI-core by straightforward ArSN reactions to generate ambient-stable highly electron deficient 82 (Chart 3 and Table 3).37 The LUMO was estimated to be −4.90 eV for this compound and was termed an ultra-electron deficient system. Notably, this has been the lowest LUMO level realized from any NDI molecule to date. This dicationic molecule accepts an electron readily and forms an ambient-stable radical ion, which is the first example of a NDI radical ion isolated under ambient conditions. On introduction of electron donating –OMe groups at the para-position of the phenylphosphonium groups (83), the LUMO slightly increases to −4.85 eV. This corroborates a long-range electronic communication between the aryl rings of the phosphonium groups and the NDI π-scaffold. Interestingly, the radical ion of both the compounds showed endurance to silica-gel column chromatography, which is a rarity for organic radical ions. The other highlight of these phosphonium-NDI-based systems is their stabilization by intramolecular noncovalent P⋯O interactions between the nonbonding orbitals of the imide O atom and the antibonding P–C orbitals. Such stabilization greatly facilitates electron delocalization through noncovalent means.
Furthermore, we recently reported a new class of multi-electron acceptors based on the conjugation of pyridinium rings at the NDI-core (84–89).38 The facile six-electron accumulation and its reversible release led us to term these polyionic systems as “electron-sponge”. The bis-pyridinium conjugated NDI molecule (84) and bis-bipyridinium conjugated molecules (85 and 86) display four reversible reduction potentials with the LUMO of −4.72, −4.73 and −4.79 eV, respectively. The tetracationic NDI 87 revealed six reduction potentials and a LUMO level of −4.77 eV. On substitution with mesityl rings at the axial-positions, NDI 88 showed a LUMO of −4.80 eV. The terminally substituted fluorinated benzyl rings in 89 showed a LUMO of −4.77 eV. Importantly, 87, 88 and 89 display six-electron reduction within an ∼1 V potential range, which is significantly lower than C60, the seminal six-electron acceptor.38 The other notable features of these electron deficient polyions are their aqueous stability. Therefore, these new design strategies can not only deliver strong two-electron acceptors but can also be extended to ambient-stable multi-electron acceptors.
NDI fused with S-based heterocycles
Zhu et al. have demonstrated the synthesis of NDI fused with sulfur-based heterocycles capped with electron withdrawing substituents (90–95) (Chart 3 and Table 4).39 These compounds were successfully used for air stable solution-processed organic thin film transistors (OTFTs). All these molecules feature two reversible reduction potentials. NDI 90, with 2-hexyldecyl groups at the axial-positions and sulphur-based heterocycles having dicyano groups showed a LUMO of −4.61 eV. On replacement of 2-hexyldecyl to 2-hexyloctyl in 91 and from 2-butyloctyl in 92 the LUMO was found to be −4.62 eV, while on introduction of 3-hexylundecyl (93) in place of 2-hexyldecyl, the LUMO decrease by 130 meV to −4.74 eV. On the other hand, NDIs 94 and 95 showed a LUMO of −4.54 eV and −4.89 eV, respectively. The sulfur enriched NDIs 96 and 97 have been successfully applied as solution processed n-type semiconductors and the LUMO of these compounds were found to be −4.62 eV and −4.69 eV, respectively.40 Heterohexacene quinonoid NDIs 98 and 99 reported by Zhao et al. showed a LUMO of −4.37 eV and −4.49 eV, respectively.41 Therefore, remarkably strong electron acceptors can also be synthesized by the fusion of sulphur-based heterocycles containing multiple electron withdrawing groups. This is clearly seen in the case of compound 95, producing one of the strongest NDI-based electron acceptors.
Perylenediimides (PDIs)
Perylenediimide (PDI) derivatives are one of the most widely utilized industrial colorants.42,43 The modification in the chemical and the physical properties of the PDI compounds can be achieved via various substitutions mainly at the three positions of this large π-scaffold: (i) in the imide N,N′ positions known as the axial position, (ii) at the 1, 6, 7 and 12 positions of the hydrocarbon core called the “bay” positions and (iii) at the 2, 5, 8, and 11 positions of the hydrocarbon core known as the “non-bay” positions (Chart 4).44 Over the last few decades, PDIs have been extensively applied in various optical and electronic applications, such as fluorescent solar collectors,45 OFETs,46 electrophotographic devices,47 OPVs,48 dye lasers49 and optical power limiters,50 due to their versatile physical, optical, and electronic properties. The PDIs showed a relatively facile two-electron uptake and release in a reversible manner and this feature has been found to be pivotal to many of these applications. The inherently electron deficient nature of the PDI π-scaffold generates attractive redox properties and easily recognizable absorption spectra of its radical anion and dianion. The attractive redox properties have led to their widespread applications in fundamental research on electron and energy-transfer induced processes.51 In the following sections, we would discuss the systematic advances in the molecular design aspects that have led to exceptionally strong electron deficient PDI molecules.
 Chart 4  Axially and core substituted PDIs. 
Starting with the simplest PDI 100 bearing an n-octyl chain at the axial positions, the LUMO was found to be −4.24 eV, which decreased to −4.37 eV for PDI 101 with fluorinated alkyl chains (Chart 4 and Table 5).10b The fluorinated axial substituents showed remarkable stability during the n-channel OTFT operation. In short, n-channel OTFTs have been realized in the TFT configuration and are made of an active-layer (n-type organic semiconducting thin film), two electrodes (source and drain) and the gate electrode, which is electrically isolated from the semiconductor by a gate dielectric. It was suggested that the slightly larger van der Waals radii of the fluorine atoms compared to the hydrogen atoms provide a close-packed solid structure, which works as a kinetic barrier for the O2 intrusion, a key prerequisite to realize high electron mobility. The core-substitution at 1,7-bay positions of PDI with fluorine (102)53 and bromine (103)52 atoms showed the LUMO energy level at −4.19 eV and −4.46 eV, respectively. The larger sized bromine atoms increase the torsion angles disrupting the intermolecular π–π interactions, which in turn significantly lowers the electron carrier mobility (μe) (103: 1.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 under vacuum and 8.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in air) as compared to compound 102 (0.35 cm2 V−1 s−1 under vacuum and 0.33 cm2 V−1 s−1 in air). The introduction of two electron withdrawing nitro groups at the bay position in compound 104 significantly decreased the LUMO energy level to −4.61 eV.54 Wasielewski and co-workers have reported the dicyano-substituted PDIs 105 and 106 with fluorinated alkyl chains and cyclohexane groups at the axial positions, respectively, which revealed LUMO energies of −4.74 eV and −4.63 eV, respectively.55 The μe values were found to be 0.64 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.10 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 105 and 106, respectively, under an ambient atmosphere. Würthner and co-workers reported the tetrafluoro-PDI 107, tetrachloro-PDI 108 and tetrabromo-PDI 109 with the LUMO values of −4.23 eV, −4.36 eV and −4.40 eV, respectively.53 Amongst the tetra-substituted compounds, 107 showed the best μe of 0.030 cm2 V−1 s−1 under vacuum and 0.029 cm2 V−1 s−1 in air.

In 2011, Müllen and co-workers reported the synthesis of ortho-substituted (i.e. non-bay substitution) tetrachloro-PDI 110, tetrabromo-PDI 111 and tetracyano-PDI 112, with the LUMO of −4.27 eV, −4.20 eV and −4.72 eV, respectively.56a Therefore, compound 112 with its attractive planar π-framework offers remarkably high electron deficiency. The tetra-arylated PDIs having different electron donating and electron withdrawing substituents at the phenyl rings were reported by Osuka and co-workers.56b However, these compounds first had reduction potential around −1.0 V (vs. Ag/Ag+ electrode), which shows that the PDI π-scaffold is no more electron deficient as a result of arylation at the non-bay positions. Subsequently, in 2014, Wang et al. reported a series of non-bay region cyano-substituted and bay-region tetrachloro substituted PDI derivatives 113 (mono-cyano), 114 (dicyano), 115 (tricyano) and 116 (tetracyano) with remarkably low-lying LUMO levels of −4.44 eV, −4.66 eV, −4.75 eV and −4.90 eV, respectively.57 The correlation between the LUMO energies and the number of cyano-substituents indicates that the LUMO energy could be effectively lowered down by increasing the number of electron withdrawing cyano-substituents at the non-bay region along with the chlorine atoms at the bay-region.
Recently, Würthner and co-workers have introduced the imidazolium cation at one of the non-bay positions of tetrachloro-PDI, which resulted in the first isolation of an ambient-stable PDI-centered zwitterionic radical. The oxidation of this radical species bestow high electron deficiency in the mono-cationic PDI molecule 117 with a LUMO of −4.56 eV.58 Wang et al. synthesized a series of octa-substituted PDI molecules, in which the molecule 118 has four chloro-substituents at the bay position and four fluoro-substituents at the non-bay position, which showed a LUMO of −4.44 eV.59 Interestingly, 119 with heptafluoro-butyl chains at the axial positions results in the lowest LUMO level (−5.03 eV) reported to date for any PDI molecule.60 The catalytic reduction of compound 119 provides the isolable PDI dianion species with excellent ambient stability and was characterized via various spectroscopic techniques as well as by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The unprecedented stability of the dianionic species can be explained via the strong electron affinity of its parent molecule and effective electron delocalization. On the other hand, the octachloro-PDI compound 120 with –NH groups at the axial positions showed a low-lying LUMO of −4.53 eV.61
The presence of the –NH group facilitates self-assembly through hydrogen bonding. The chlorine atoms drive contortion of the π-core forming two-dimensional π–π stacked paths for excellent electron transport. Significantly, compound 120 based TFTs (Thin Film Transistors) could be operated in air, with an excellent electron mobility of 0.82 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Recently, our group reported the synthesis of octabromoperylene dianhydride 121 and diimides 122 with remarkably low-lying LUMO energies of −4.76 eV and −4.59 eV, respectively.62 These molecules revealed a combination of diverse halogen-bonding interactions (Br⋯Br, CO⋯Br and Br⋯π) in the crystal structures.
The Matile group introduced sulfur chemistry at the core of the PDI π-scaffold. Compound 123 having two octylsulfides at the 1,7-bay positions showed a LUMO of −4.00 eV. The electron deficiency could be significantly increased via controlled oxidation to afford molecule 124 having one sulfide and one sulfoxide with a LUMO of −4.26 eV. PDI 125 with two sulfoxides showed a LUMO of −4.32 eV and the highly fluorescent 126 having two sulfones at the bay-region showed a LUMO of −4.40 eV.1a Moving towards another approach for increasing electron affinity, Seferos and co-workers have synthesized a series of thionated PDI derivatives, where the carbonyl oxygen atoms of imide groups were replaced by the sulfur atom(s) in a controlled manner. Compound 127 with one sulfur atom and three oxygen atoms, 128 with two sulfur and two oxygen atoms, 129 with three sulfur and one oxygen atom and 130 with all four sulfur atoms demonstrated the low-lying LUMO of −4.55 eV, −4.59 eV, −4.74 eV and −4.87 eV, respectively.63 Thus, the electron deficiency of the PDI π-scaffold could be remarkably boosted by a systematic increase in the number of sulfur atoms at the imide positions. Furthermore, these compounds offered rapid intersystem crossing to triplet states due to the heavy atom effect.
NDI oligomers and polymers
Electron deficient π-extended NDI oligomers and polymers with n-type semiconducting properties have also been reported (Chart 5; Table 6). In molecules 131–136, two NDI units have been conjugated with different π-linkers.

Zhao et al. have reported 131 and 132 with high performance n-type semiconducting properties.64 The λmax of these dyes were found to be ∼1100 nm.
The LUMO level of 131 was estimated to be −5.02 eV on the basis of the onset value of the 1st reduction potential, while it was found to be −4.96 eV for compound 132. Compound 132 exhibited n-type semiconducting properties with an electron mobility of up to 0.96 cm2 V−1 s−1. The λmax of compound 133 appears at 740 nm. The LUMO level of this compound was found to be −4.74 eV.65 The core expanded NDIs 134 and 135 and their electron transporting behaviour were reported by Gao et al.66 The LUMO levels of these compounds were found to be −4.73 eV and −4.38 eV, respectively. NDI 134 absorbs at 608 nm, while 135 absorbs at 528 nm in dichloromethane. Interestingly, 135 showed an electron mobility of 0.35 cm2 V−1 s−1. Butadiynylene NDI 136 was reported by Wang et al. and it exhibited a LUMO level of −4.28 eV.67
There are several NDI-based polymers, which have been reported to have low-lying LUMO levels and exhibit n-type semiconducting properties. NDI polymer 13768 is a high mobility electron transporter. It bestows a LUMO level of −4.22 eV and absorbs at 710 nm in thin films. In polymer 138 having fluorinated alkyl chains,69 the LUMO level further decreased by 70 meV to −4.29 eV. This polymer exhibited unipolar n-type semiconducting properties in FET (Field Effect Transistor) with an electron mobility of 6.5 cm2 V−1 s−1. Polymer 139, having 2-decyltetradecyl at the axial-positions and bis-selenophene groups at the NDI-core displayed a LUMO level of −4.24 eV.70 Interestingly, this polymer finds application in bulk heterojunction solar cells. It forms a highly ordered lamellar crystalline structure with a high electron mobility of 0.7 cm2 V−1 s−1. NDI polymers 140 and 141 having sulfur-based heterocycles and end-capped with electron acceptors demonstrated the LUMO of −4.55 and −4.59 eV, respectively.71 They absorb strongly in the NIR region at 920 and 931 nm, respectively. Polymer 140 exhibited unipolar n-channel charge transport with an electron mobility of 0.38 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a current on/off ratio of 106, and 141 showed a distinctly low electron mobility of ∼10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. NDI-based n-channel organic transistors 142 also demonstrated the effect of selenium substitution on molecular packing and their charge transport properties (143) (Chart 5).72
Polymers 142 and 143 showed an n-channel electron mobility of 0.039 cm2 V−1 s−1 while 143 showed an electron mobility of 0.003 cm2 V−1 s−1. The LUMO energy levels of 142 and 143 were found to be −4.30 eV and −4.40 eV, respectively. Liu et al. have also reported benzobisthiadiazole-based NDI polymers and studied the effect of selenium substitution on the electron mobility of 144–148.73,74 Notably, polymer 144 showed an ultra-high electron mobility of 8.7 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas 145 showed an electron mobility of 3.5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which further decreased in 146 to 3.1 cm2 V−1 s−1 and in 144 to 2.2 cm2 V−1 s−1.73 The LUMO level of 144 was found to be −3.98 eV. The substitution of sulfur of benzobisthiadiazole by selenium in 146 produced a LUMO level of −4.02 eV. On introduction of two fluorine atoms into benzobisthiadiazole 145, the LUMO level decreased by 80 meV to −4.06 eV while on substitution of sulfur of 145 by selenium in 147 exhibited a LUMO of −4.09 eV. Polymer 148 having benzobisoxadiazole rings showed a LUMO of −4.21 eV due to the high electronegativity of the oxygen atoms. This polymer also showed an air stable n-channel FET with an electron mobility of 0.4 cm2 V−1 s−1. These polymers absorb in the visible region with λmax in the range of 666–713 nm.74
PDI oligomers
Recently, multiple PDI π-scaffolds have been organized by coupling reactions leading to the formation of large π-extended systems with decent electron deficiency and n-type semiconducting properties (Chart 5; Table 6). Wang and co-workers have reported spiro-fused PDIs 149 (ELUMO = −4.08 eV) and 150 (ELUMO = −4.10 eV) comprising four and two PDI units, respectively.75 The spiro-fused PDI-tetramer showed excellent performance as a nonfullerene organic solar cell device with an attractive Photon Conversion Efficiency (PCE) value of 7.17%. In an earlier report, this group had reported the coupling of NDI and PDI units to form a π-extended hybrid arylene array 151, with a low-lying LUMO of −4.52 eV.76 This extended π-system showed enhanced electron affinity and resulted in excellent OTFT characteristics under ambient conditions with 0.25 cm2 V−1 s−1 mobility and 107Ion/Ioff (on-to-off current ratio) value. Therefore, new generation of electron deficient compounds can be synthesized by thoughtful arrangement of the PDI π-scaffolds, which interact in a through-space manner or by covalent linkages of multiple PDI or PDI–NDI π-scaffolds.
Applications
In this section, we discuss the various applications that have unfolded over the years, which are majorly dependent on the electron deficient nature of the arylenediimide π-scaffold (Fig. 1). With several of the advanced applications in organic electronic devices, the role of the substituents in effecting the well-ordered self-assembly and solubilisation in common solvents has been found to be critical. Therefore, in specialized applications like the semiconductor devices or photovoltaics the role of the pendant groups at the axial positions becomes crucial as the judicious selection of it can facilitate the advanced solution processing techniques, impart ambient stability and improve charge transport characteristics. From the intriguing applications of the arylenediimides in organic batteries, anion transport and catalysis, as photosensitizers it is evident that each of their sub-parts (naphthalene unit, imide regions, imide carbonyls, and pendant axial groups) has a precise role to perform to carry out the overall function.

As semiconductor in OFETs
Organic π-conjugated semiconducting devices differ from the conventional inorganic solid state devices due to their facile functionality and ease of device fabrication, which has led to an impressive development of the OTFTs.77 The OTFTs are promising for the development of low-cost and large-area electronic devices. The NDI and PDI-based semiconducting devices have shown remarkable electron mobility. OTFTs based on arylenediimide polymers have also gained interest during the last two decades, owing to their applications as electronic papers, sensors and RFIDs (radio frequency identification cards).78 To realize the true benefits of OTFTs, solution phase processing techniques, such as spin coating, roll to roll and inkjet printing have been found to be promising routes towards low cost applications.79 Among the OTFT materials, air stability of the n-type semiconducting materials is an important issue for their real-life applications. If a molecule has a high LUMO energy level, the corresponding radical anion would be unstable in an ambient environment as the injected electron can be transferred to environmental impurities. Lowering the LUMO level via substituting strong electron withdrawing groups to the conjugated arylenediimide core is therefore vital to achieve ambient stability and effective charge-transport of n-type semiconductors.80,77c The low LUMO energy also aids in effective electron injection by using gold or other high work function metal electrodes.81 Due to the ease of synthetic tailorability and enormous possibilities to lower the LUMO level, NDIs and PDIs have been extensively explored as n-type semiconductors.9d,25,39,77 As discussed earlier, the propensity for electron uptake by these compounds can be easily estimated by their first reduction potential and correlated with the thermodynamic stability of the charge carrier under ambient conditions.53,82
Würthner et al. have reported core chlorinated NDI with fluorinated alkyl chains at the axial positions (152), which functions as an OTFT as well as a polymorph-based single-crystal field-effect transistor (SCFET) (Chart 6). The SCFET fabricated device exhibited a remarkable electron mobility of 8.6 cm2 V−1 s−1 in air while the Si/SiO2 substrate based OTFT device exhibited an electron mobility of 0.37 cm2 V−1 s−1 in air.77a,b Zhu et al. have reported an OTFT device of a highly electron deficient NDI (153) with an electron mobility value of 3.50 cm2 V−1 s−1.77c,d Marks and co-workers have investigated a diverse range of molecules with electron withdrawing substituents (Cl, Br and CN) at the core of NDI and PDI. They demonstrated that the electron mobility of these compounds depends on the substituent induced core-distortion of the molecular structure, while the threshold voltage (Vth) and Ion/Ioff values are affected by the LUMO energy level.82 The core-substituted di-cyano derivatives of NDI and PDI showed the best OTFT results, with high mobility, air stability and solution processibility.7 The air stability and mobility further increased by incorporating a fluorinated carbon chain into the axial part of the PDI, which provides the kinetic barrier to the oxygen permeation due to their close-packed structure. From these observations, it has been found that the LUMO energy ranging between −3.8 eV and −4.5 eV can be ideal for the optimum functioning of n-type semiconductors.

As an active material in organic batteries
Organic molecule based electrode materials can establish as a feasible option for the replacement of inorganic oxide materials in lithium-ion batteries, owing to their abundance as well as recyclability and structural diversity.83 Among several types of organic electrode materials, conjugated carbonyl functionalized compounds have turned out to be promising as they present redox stability and high theoretical capacity.84 In a battery system, molecules with good electron affinity are utilized as active components for the cathode material.85 The NDI-based polymers (154 and 155) due to their ability to undergo reversible electrochemical reduction and oxidation have emerged as highly promising systems (Chart 6).86 Zhou and co-workers have proposed a poly-NDI-based cathode material (156), which exhibited good capacity and cycling stability in lithium-ion batteries.85 Although only two imide carbonyl groups of one NDI monomeric unit take part in reversible lithium binding, the capacities (≈200 mA h g−1 with the voltage range of 1.5–3.5 V) are still comparable with other inorganic electrode active materials. It was suggested that the electrochemical responses are more correlated to the core part rather than the imide substitution. Furthermore, PDI-based polyimides showed a higher discharge voltage and cyclability as compared to NDI-based polyimide materials, as PDIs have better conjugation and electron delocalization ability than the NDIs. Substitution with electron withdrawing groups at the core position decreases the LUMO level to boost the reducibility and energy density. Picard and co-workers have reported a full-organic lithium battery via utilizing the poly(N-n-hexyl-3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic)imide as a positive electrode and the pre-lithiated tetra-lithium perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylate as a negative electrode material (157). The assembled lithium battery revealed good cyclability of up to 200 cycles and an average cell voltage of ∼1.2 V.87
In addition, a diverse range of NDI and PDI-based cyclophanes, macrocycles and catenanes have been reported and studied for their photo- and redox properties. These classes of elegant macrocyclic structures have been recently reviewed88 and therefore we have restricted this discussion to some of the emergent applications of these compounds in organic batteries. Stoddart et al. have demonstrated that cyclophanes (158–160) can be applied as electrode active materials in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. The NDI-based cyclophane 158 showed an ultrahigh rate capability in organic rechargeable lithium-ion batteries with a capacity of 146.4 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 0.1C while at an ultrahigh current rate (100C) it was found to be 58.1 mA h g−1.89 To have an insight into the structure-performance relation, cyclophanes 159 and 160 having one and two pyromellitic diimide (PMDI) units, respectively, were synthesized.90a,b It was found that the battery performance deteriorated by decreasing the number of NDI units in the cyclophanes.
Dunn and co-workers have demonstrated that NDI (having NH groups at the axial positions and without any core substitution) with a LUMO level of −4.0 eV showed a high capacity of 121 mA h g−1 (at C/5 rate).90c The capacity was found to be 100 mA h g−1 (at C/5 rate) for NDI having dicyano and hexyl groups at the core and axial positions, respectively, with a LUMO of −4.5 eV. NDI molecules having a LUMO level lower than −4.5 eV and higher than −4.0 eV were found to exhibit significantly lower capacities. These studies on NDI-based molecules indicate that a LUMO range of −4.0 eV to −4.5 eV can be suitable for applications in organic lithium-ion batteries.
As acceptors in nonfullerene solar cells
In recent years, research on organic photovoltaics (OPVs) has gained tremendous interest as these devices offer a lightweight, flexible, cost-effective approach for solar energy conversion.91 Most of the OPV devices are based on the bulk-heterojunction cells (BHJs) utilizing either small molecules or polymers as the donor units with fullerene derivatives as the acceptor units to construct the interpenetrating networks of hole and electron conducting pathways.92 Fullerene derivatives have high electron affinity and form well-optimized systems to obtain efficient charge separation and mobility. However, despite successes in laboratory-scale devices, high synthetic cost, difficult structural tunability and instability in air and thermal stress make fullerenes non-ideal materials for industrial scale application.93 Electron deficient NDIs/PDIs have been found to be attractive alternatives to fullerenes.94 Kim and co-workers have developed an all polymer solar cell utilizing NDI-based acceptor (161) with the well-known polymer donor poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-alt-1,3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-5-(2-hexyldecyl)-4H-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6(5H)-dione] (PBDTTTPD) (162) (Chart 6).95 This polymer solar cell shows an excellent Photon Conversion Efficiency (PCE) of 6.64%, even better than the control fullerene-polymer based solar cell (PCE 6.12%), where phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was utilized as an acceptor. The improved performance of this solar cell device is attributed to the better alignment of energy levels resulting in a high Voc (open circuit voltage) value of 1.06 V. Furthermore, this all-polymer solar cell had enhanced mechanical strength and flexibility. The mechanically robust properties afford more tolerance to severe deformation and make it a better candidate for flexible and portable devices as compared to polymer/fullerene-based devices. Furthermore, a series of cyano-substituted NDI dimers linked together with the thiophene derivatives as acceptors (163) and 164 as electron donors were synthesized to realize BHJs. The observed PCE value of 3.01% is the highest value amongst the other reported NDI based acceptors.96 Nuckolls and co-workers reported a new class of helical conjugated PDI oligomers 165 as acceptors towards the BHJ solar cell with an attractive PCE of 8.3%.97 In another report, the Yu group has reported a covalently bound cluster type electron acceptor bearing four α-substituted PDI moieties 166 and donor polymer 167 for OPV devices with a remarkable PCE of 8.47%.98 In terms of solar cell performance NDI-based molecules lag behind the PDI-based acceptors. The studies of organic solar cells suggest that the HOMO–LUMO band gap difference of ∼1.75 eV is good for high performing solar cells.
Anion–π interactions and catalysis
In several chemical and bio-chemical processes, non-covalent interactions involving aromatic units, such as π–π stacking, lone pair–π, cation–π and anion–π, are crucial in protein folding, drug recognition, and in crystal engineering.99,100
The current study of anion–π interactions between the electron deficient aromatic systems sustaining positive quadrupole moment and various anions is important in the areas of anion transport and in catalysis.101
A classical aromatic ring has negative quadrupole moment (Qzz < 0) due to the presence of a π-electron cloud above and below the plane of the ring. These aromatic surfaces with a π-basic nature are compatible for the cation–π interaction. The substitution of strong electron-withdrawing groups at the aromatic surface alters the Qzz from negative to positive (Qzz > 0). For example, hexafluoro-benzene shows a Qzz value of +10 Buckinghams (B). In recent years, NDI has emerged as a pivotal π-scaffold to explore anion–π interactions as a result of its large quadrupole moment (Qzz = +19 B for the native NDI). The substitution of two cyano groups at the core-position of NDI enhances the Qzz value to +39 B, which makes it an ideal platform for anion–π interactions.102
Recently, we obtained the first X-ray crystallographic evidence of anion–π interactions in highly electron deficient dicationic NDI (822+) and its radical cation (82˙+) with BF4− and BPh4− anions, respectively (Fig. 2).37 In the case of 822+, the two BF4− anions interact strongly (through the F atoms) with the naphthalene ring from the top and bottom sites. In addition, we recently obtained crystallographic confirmation towards multiple anion–π interactions.38 The highly electron deficient tetracationic 874+ forms strong anion–π interactions with four PF6− anions.
 Fig. 2  Crystal structure of (a) 822+·2BF4−, (b) 82˙+·BPh4− and (c) 874+·4PF6− showing evidence of anion–π interactions. 
In a significant development, the Matile group has established a trans-membrane passage of various anions using a rigid molecular rod of NDI oligomers.103 Recently, anion–π interactions have been applied to realize catalysis in various chemical transformations, where the anionic transition state is stabilized on the π-acidic NDI surface. These interactions have been further extended to enolate, enamine and iminium chemistry as well as the generation of five stereogenic centers from an achiral acyclic starting material.104 The first anion–π artificial enzyme has been realized by expending the NDI π-acidic surface.105 Subsequently, the Matile group has introduced the PDI π-scaffold towards anion–π catalysis. The quadrupole moment of PDI is found to be +23.2 B, which can be increased to +70.9 B with the substitution of electron withdrawing groups at the core-position. The large π-surface of the PDI (168) affords sufficient space to accommodate organic anionic transition states and showed the highest enantioselectivity discovered so far in anion–π catalysis. It was found that the deplanarization of the PDI-surface deactivates anion–π catalysis, which can be overcompensated by introducing electron withdrawing substituents.106
Photosensitizers
A major goal of research on artificial photosynthesis involves photosensitization at highly reducing metal centres using as efficiently as possible the solar spectrum reaching the Earth's surface. Intriguingly, the radical anions of arylenediimide absorb at wavelengths as long as 950 nm and are powerful photoreductants with excited state oxidation potentials that rival the organometallic chromophores. Wasielewski and co-workers have described a set of dyads in which the PDI (169) or the NDI (170) chromophores are attached to Re(bpy)(CO)3 through either the bipyridine ligand or directly to the Re metal center via a pyridine ligand (Chart 6). The chromophores are reduced with a mild reducing agent, after which excitation with long-wavelength red or near-infrared light leads to the reduction of the Re complex. The kinetics of electron transfer from the photo-excited anions to the Re complex is monitored using transient visible/near-IR and mid-IR spectroscopy, complemented by theoretical spectroscopic assignments. The photo-driven charge shift from the reduced PDI or NDI to the complex occurs in picoseconds regardless of whether PDI or NDI is attached to the bipyridine or to the Re center, but back electron transfer is found to be three orders of magnitude slower with the chromophore attached to the Re center. These results provide critical information regarding the design of future catalytic systems incorporating PDI/NDI radical anions as chromophores.107
In contrast to biological photosynthesis, which uses the energy of several visible light photons for the challenging oxidation of water, chemical photocatalysis typically involves only single-photon excitation. Accordingly, König and co-workers have reported the excitation of the PDI radical anion and accumulation of sufficient energy for the reduction of stable aryl chlorides giving aryl radicals, which were trapped by hydrogen atom donors or used in carbon–carbon bond formation. Intriguingly, this consecutive photoinduced electron transfer (PET) overcomes the energetic limitation of visible light photoredox catalysis and allowed the photocatalytic conversion of less reactive chemical bonds.108
Conclusions and future perspective
In conclusion, this review article has made an attempt to highlight the gradual emergence of diverse molecular design principles to realize extremely electron deficient molecules originating from the inherently electron deficient naphthalenediimide and perylenediimide π-scaffolds. The race to garner the top position (amongst the electron deficient molecules) has been enthralling and exceptionally close with a difference of only a few meV between the competitors (Chart 7). The sulfone group has been adorned at the core-positions of the arylenediimide and is shown to be a remarkably effective way in bestowing the π-scaffold highly electron deficient. The diazacene ring in combination with cyano groups has shown to be an attractive way to confer high electron deficiency, while maintaining the planarity of the π-scaffold. The time tested cyano group in combination with chlorine atoms at the bay and non-bay positions of the perylenediimide, respectively, results in the lowest LUMO amongst this class of molecules. Interestingly, the replacement of the imide oxygen with multiple sulfur atoms (thioimide groups) can substantially enhance the electron deficiency of the arylenediimides. The advent of the phosphonium groups and pyridinium rings at the naphthalenediimide-core has also significantly broadened the traditional tool-box available to synthetic chemists to engineer highly electron deficient molecules, which remains mostly limited to the nitro or cyano groups or the fluorine atoms. The tetraphenyl phosphonium groups allowed achieving one of the strongest electron acceptors amongst the naphthalenediimide class of molecules. Intramolecular P⋯O interactions allow electron delocalization through the noncovalent conduits and are one of the crucial mainstays for this new design strategy.
 Chart 7  Five most electron deficient NDI/PDI-based molecules. 
While most of these electron deficient systems are two-electron acceptors these can be further extended towards multi-electron acceptors. The conjugation of viologens at the naphthalenediimide-core not only render them highly electron deficient but also make them capable of accepting and releasing multiple electrons in a reversible fashion within a small potential window. These polyionic systems were found to be water stable, a feat difficult to attain with highly electron deficient molecules. In the elegantly designed arylenediimide cyclophanes, the naphthalenediimides/perylenediimides are arranged cofacially or in a triangular fashion and are capable of accepting four- or six-electrons reversibly. Here, through-space interactions between the π-scaffolds are shown to be critical as they facilitate the electron uptake as well their efficient delocalization.
With regard to the applications of the arylenediimides, a range of new innovative concepts have been presented. In these applications, the critical role of each of the molecular segment of the arylenediimide (axial substituents, naphthalene-/perylene-core, imide groups) is clearly evident. The frontier molecular orbital energy levels have a resounding role to play in many of these applications. The importance of controlling weak supramolecular interactions like π-stacking and H-bonding (through the π-scaffold and axial substituents) has also been well appreciated to realize molecular systems with high electron mobility and high-performance n-type semiconductors. Such noncovalent interactions also play a pivotal role in controlling anion–π interactions as well as in anion transport and anion catalysis. In the applications towards organic batteries, the imide carbonyl groups of the arylenediimide aid in reversible binding of the Li ions, while the role of the excited state energy levels of the arylenediimides is of paramount importance in designing of artificial photosynthetic systems and photosensitizers.
The rapidity with which new molecular design principles and applications of arylenediimides has unfurled is quite outstanding. Ambient stability would be quintessential for the arylenediimide-based electron deficient systems and their different electron-reduced states to realize some of the advanced applications. The upcoming new design ideas are guided towards increasing the stability of the arylenediimides upon one or more electron accumulation. Weak intramolecular noncovalent interactions whereby complementary orbital overlap(s) facilitate electron delocalization and enhance the overall stability of the system have been established recently.37 Such design elements have been shown to provide stability to dianionic naphthalenediimides even under aqueous conditions.109 With access to stable redox states, a new generation of applications would emerge that combine the fundamental properties of electronic spin and charge and their interaction with multivalent ions. Arylenediimides would also be at the forefront catering to the demands of energy harvesting, storage and transport.
