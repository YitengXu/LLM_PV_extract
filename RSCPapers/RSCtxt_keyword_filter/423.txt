Cu2O, ZnO, and Cd(OH)2 were used as starting materials, and 3-mercaptopropionic acid was used as the capping agent. The effects of Cu dopant concentration, sintering temperature, and sintering time on the photoluminescence properties of Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS nanocrystal thin films have been systematically investigated.

Introduction
Luminescent quantum dot thin films (QDTFs) have been extensively investigated over the past two decades due to their high potential applications in quantum dot light emitting diodes, quantum dot solar cells, thin film transistors, temperature sensors, and photodetectors.1–15 Besides, luminescent QDTFs can absorb and convert harmful UV light to usable visible light in thin film solar cells, which can expand the photoresponse range and enhance the photoelectric conversion efficiency. Thereby, luminescent QDTFs have high potential for applications in thin film solar cells. According to the reports in the literature, QDTFs are mainly fabricated by self-assembling or coating quantum dot solutions.1–20 Thus, the synthesis of high quality quantum dots is essential. Furthermore, a ligand exchange process and a tedious post-purification procedure are usually required. These complex procedures are not suitable for highly efficient and low-cost fabrication of QDTFs. Thus, developing a direct deposition method to luminescent QDTFs without the need for the complex quantum dot synthesis using molecular-based precursor solution is of great significance.
Large-area luminescent thin films of wide-gap II–VI compounds (e.g. ZnS, ZnSe, and CdS) play an important role in visible light optoelectronics.21–23 ZnS with a band gap of 3.68 eV is widely used as an excellent host material for highly efficient phosphors.24–26 Cu-doped ZnS nanocrystals are a very important class of phosphors for the fabrication of thin film electroluminescent devices. It was reported that the emission of Cu-doped ZnS QDs mainly originates from the transition from the conduction band of ZnS to the Cu-d states.27–30 As a result, the emission of Cu-doped ZnS QDs is strictly restricted to the blue-green region.27–30,39 In order to achieve tunable emission which covers the whole visible light region, Cd2+ ions are incorporated into ZnS lattices to lower the conduction band position of host materials.31–33 Although many groups have been focusing on the synthesis of Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS quantum dots, there are no reports on the direct deposition of Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS quantum dot thin films using a molecular-based precursor solution.
Here, we present a simple one-step solution approach to fabricate luminescent Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS QDTF by spin-coating a mixed Cu, Zn, and Cd precursor solution. Cu2O, ZnO, and Cd(OH)2 were used as starting materials and were dissolved in the ethanol solution of carbon disulfide and 1-butylamine, and 3-mercaptopropionic acid was used as the capping agent. All synthetic procedures were conducted in open air. As-prepared Cu+-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films exhibit tunable emission covering the whole visible light region and the absolute photoluminescence quantum yield can reach as high as 25.5%.
Experimental section
I. Chemicals
Copper(I) oxides (Cu2O, 99%), zinc oxide (ZnO, 99.99%), cadmium hydroxide (Cd(OH)2, AR), carbon disulfide (CS2, 99.9%), 1-butylamine (CH3(CH2)3NH2, 99%), ethanol (CH3CH2OH, AR), and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA, HSCH2CH2COOH, 98%) were purchased from Aladdin. All chemicals were used as received without any further purification.
II. Preparation of semiconductor precursor solution
Zn, Cd, or Cu precursor solution (0.2 M) was prepared by dissolving 0.1628 g (2.0 mmol) of ZnO, 0.3317 g (2.0 mmol) of Cd(OH)2, or 0.1430 g (1.0 mmol) of Cu2O in 7.0 mL of ethanol, 1.2 mL of CS2 (20 mmol), and 2.0 mL of 1-butylamine (20 mmol) under magnetic stirring on a hot plate at 60 °C until all the solid dissolved, respectively. Finally, Zn, Cd, and Cu precursor solutions were mixed, followed by centrifugation at 12000 rpm for 5 min prior to spin-coating.
III. Deposition of Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS luminescent thin films
In a typical fabrication of a Cu-doped Zn0.5Cd0.5S quantum dot thin film with a doping concentration of 1 at%, 1.0 mL of Zn stock solution, 1.0 mL of Cd stock solution, 0.02 mL of Cu stock solution, and 0.15 mL (1.7 mmol) of MPA were mixed under stirring. The luminescent Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS quantum dot thin film was spun on a coverslip (20 × 20 × 0.5 mm) at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by a sintering process on a hot plate at 210 °C for 10 s in open air. The quantum dot thin film with a thickness of ∼80 nm was obtained by a single spin-coating process.
IV. Characterization
UV-vis diffuse reflective spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrometer. PL spectra were captured on a Hitachi F-7000 spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp as the excitation source, and the PL intensity was calculated by integration of the PL curve. Absolute photoluminescence quantum yields (QYs) were measured using an absolute PL quantum yield measurement system (C9920-02, Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., Japan). The luminescence decay curve was obtained with a Lecroy Wave Runner 6100 digital oscilloscope (1 GHz) using a tunable laser (pulse width 1/4 4 ns, gate 1/4 50 ns) as the excitation source (Continuum Sunlite OPO). The powder XRD patterns were recorded using a Bruker D8 FOCUS X-ray diffractometer. The chemical composition was determined by energy disperse X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) by using a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800) equipped with a Bruker AXS XFlash detector 4010. The thickness of the thin film was measured using a step profiler (AMBIOS, XP-100). The atomic force microscopy (AFM) image was taken on a Bruker Dimension Icon.
Results and discussion
Recently, we developed a general butyldithiocarbamic acid-based molecular precursor solution approach for the fabrication of Cu(InGa)(S,Se)2, CuIn(S,Se)2, and Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)2 thin film solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 8.9%, 10.1%, and 6.0%, respectively.34–36 Thermally degradable butyldithiocarbamic acid can be in situ prepared by the reaction of 1-butylamine and carbon disulfide. Many types of metal oxides and hydroxides can be dissolved in butyldithiocarbamic acid, forming a variety of metal precursor solutions. Fig. 1A shows the dissolution mechanism of Cu2O, ZnO, and Cd(OH)2 in butyldithiocarbamic acid. As can be seen in Fig. 1B, the Cu, Zn, and Cd precursor solutions are clear and transparent. 3-Mercaptopropionic acid was used to control the size of quantum dots in thin films. Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS quantum dot thin films were fabricated by spin-coating the mixed Cu, Zn, and Cd precursor solution, followed by a sintering process. By changing Zn/Cd ratios, a series of luminescent Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS quantum dot thin films were obtained, which cover the whole visible light region, as shown in Fig. 1C and D.

It was found that the photoluminescence properties of Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS quantum dot thin films are strongly influenced by Cu-doping concentration, sintering temperature, and sintering time. According to some previous reports, the dopant concentration strongly influences the PL intensity of quantum dots.31–33 Thus, we first studied on the effect of the doping concentration on the PL intensity. Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films with different Cu doping concentrations were prepared while keeping all other experimental conditions the same (e.g., the molar ratio of Zn/Cd = 2:1, and the amount of MPA is 0.15 mL). Fig. 2A shows several PL spectra of Cu-doped Zn0.67Cd0.33S thin films with different Cu doping concentrations. The PL intensity and peak positions of Cu-doped Zn0.67Cd0.33S thin films show a notable dependence on the Cu doping concentration. As shown in Fig. 2B, the PL peak positions shift from 492 to 543 nm with the increasing Cu content from 0.1% to 2.0%. Interestingly, it was observed that the PL intensity of Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films showed a maximum value when the Cu doping concentration is 1.0%, which is consistent with those of previously reported Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS QDs.31–33

In addition, the PL intensity and PL peak positions of luminescent Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films are also strongly influenced by the sintering temperature (see Fig. 2C). Fig. 2D illustrates the effects of the sintering temperature on the PL intensity and PL peak positions of Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films. A successive red shift in PL spectra resulting from an increase of particle size was observed with increasing reaction temperature. It is well known that the final size of quantum dots is strongly dependent on the reaction temperature in a traditional wet-chemical synthesis of quantum dots. A higher reaction temperature would hinder the nucleation and result in larger quantum dots. Additionally, the PL quantum yield of quantum dots is strongly dependent on the size of quantum dots. In our system, the optimal sintering temperature was found to be 210 °C for the fabrication of luminescent Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films.
Finally, the effect of the sintering time on the PL intensity and PL peak position was investigated, as shown in Fig. 2E and F. The optimal sintering time was found to be 10 s for fabricating high performance luminescent Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films. Thereby, in this study, the optimal Cu doping concentration, the sintering temperature, and the sintering time are 1.0%, 210 °C, and 10 s, respectively.
After the optimization of PL properties for luminescent QD thin films, Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films with different Zn/Cd ratios were fabricated. The emission color of Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films can be tuned by changing the molar ratio of Zn/Cd. Fig. 3A displays the UV-vis reflectance spectra of Cu-doped ZnxCd1–xS films with different Zn/Cd ratios. It was reported that the band gap of Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS quantum dots was strongly related to the Zn/Cd ratio.31–33 As expected, a successive red shift in reflectance spectra of Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films was observed, as shown in Fig. 3A, confirming that a tunable band gap was obtained by changing the ratio of Zn/Cd. As a well-known phenomenon, the band gap of the alloyed ZnxCd1–xS quantum dots decreases with the increase of content of low band gap CdS. Furthermore, the emission of Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films originates from the transition from the conduction band of the host ZnxCd1−xS to the Cu-d states. Thus, it is expected that alloyed ZnxCd1−xS thin films could be a kind of host material by varying the composition to achieve a wide tunable dopant emission. By decreasing the Zn/Cd molar ratio from 3:1 to 1:10, the PL spectra of Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films with a tunable emission peak from 532 to 623 nm were achieved and are shown in Fig. 3B. The highest absolute quantum yield of Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films can reach 25.5%. In order to confirm that the emission of QD thin films does come from the transition from the conduction band to the Cu-d states, undoped ZnxCd1−xS thin films with the same Zn/Cd ratios were also fabricated. Compared with pristine ZnxCd1−xS thin films, the significant red-shifts in PL spectra were observed for Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films (see Fig. 3C and S1†), confirming that the emission of Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films should be contributed to the Cu dopant state.

The molar ratios of Zn/Cd in Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films were determined by energy disperse X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and the results are provided in Table 1. Compared with the nominal values, it was found that the real Zn/Cd ratios in samples are very close to the starting precursor ratios. In addition, the fluorescence lifetimes were measured. Fig. 4 shows a series of PL decay curves of Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films. The fitted PL decay data for all the samples are listed in Table 1. All the thin films exhibit bi-exponential decays with an average fluorescence lifetime of hundreds of nanoseconds, which are in good agreement with the previous reports for Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS QDs.21–24 Note that the fluorescence lifetimes of Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films are random and independent of PL peak positions and Zn/Cd ratios.

The crystal structure of Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films was measured by XRD (see Fig. 5). All thin films exhibit three broad diffraction peaks, indicating that these Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films are composed of nanoparticles. The crystal sizes calculated from the Scherrer equation are in the range of 2.2–3.6 nm, which are dependent on the Zn/Cd ratios. Detailed analysis of the XRD patterns revealed that Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films have the characteristics of a zincblende (ZB) structure. It was observed that the diffraction peaks systematically shift toward lower angles with increasing cadmium content in Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin films, indicating that the Cd2+ ions have been incorporated in the lattice of ZnS. It is noteworthy that the lattice mismatch between zincblende CdS and ZnS is only 7%, which enables the formation of homogeneous alloyed ZnxCd1−xS thin films. Additionally, no diffraction peaks from Cu2S and CuS impurities were detected in our samples, confirming that the incorporation of Cu ions does not result in phase separation.

The surface morphology and surface roughness of the Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS thin film were measured by AFM. Fig. 6 shows a typical AFM image of the Cu-doped Zn0.5Cd0.5S thin film. The root mean square (Rms) surface roughness of this film is 0.89 nm, which is significantly lower than those of quantum dot thin films via layer-by-layer assembly and a spin-coating process.14,16 High quality quantum dot thin films are critically important to their device applications.

In thin film solar cells, UV light cannot be utilized and it is usually harmful to thin film solar cells, especially to organic solar cells and dye-sensitized solar cells since their organic components can be degraded under long-term UV light illumination.37,38 Thus, filtering of UV light can effectively improve the stability of thin film solar cells. Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS quantum dot thin films can absorb and convert harmful UV light to usable visible light, which can extend the photoresponse range of thin film solar cells. On the other hand, a transparent and conductive thin film is usually used as the electrode to collect the hole or electron in thin film solar cells, which impels us to fabricate luminescent, transparent, and conductive multi-functional thin films. The Cu-doped quantum dot thin films with different Zn/Cd ratios were fabricated on the opposite side of the ITO layer in order to eliminate the effect of quantum dot thin films on the sheet resistance of ITO.
The absorption, excitation, and PL spectra of ITO/glass/Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS quantum dot bifacial thin films are shown in Fig. 7A. It was observed that coating of Cu-doped quantum dot thin films does not significantly decrease the transmittance of the ITO layer in the wavelength range of 450 nm to 800 nm. As expected, Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS quantum dot thin films can absorb UV light and convert it to green, yellow, or red light by changing Zn/Cd ratios, as demonstrated in Fig. 7B. These luminescent, transparent, and conductive multi-functional ITO/quantum dot bifacial thin films have very high potential for applications in thin film solar cells. They can not only act as the UV light protection layer to improve the stability of thin film solar cells, but also can serve as the luminescent layer to convert harmful UV light to utilizable visible light.

The first one on the left in Fig. 7B and C is pure ITO glass and the other three samples are ITO/glass/QDTFs with Zn/Cd ratios of 3:1, 1:1, and 1:4, respectively. 
Conclusions
In summary, high quality Cu-doped ZnxCd1−xS quantum dot luminescent thin films have been directly fabricated via a facile solution method using Cu2O, ZnO, Cd(OH)2, butylamine, and carbon disulfide as starting materials. All the synthetic procedures were conducted in open air. As-prepared luminescent thin films exhibit tunable PL emission covering the entire visible light region by changing the Zn/Cd ratios, and the highest PL QY can reach 25.5%. The Zn/Cd ratios, the doping concentration, the sintering temperature, and the sintering time have great effects on the PL properties of quantum dot thin films. Our experimental results indicated that luminescent quantum dot thin films have high potential for applications in luminescent, transparent, and conductive thin films. More interestingly, these luminescent quantum dot thin films without the involvement of the complex quantum dot synthesis could be directly used as luminescent layers in quantum dot light emitting diodes. The follow-up studies are underway in our laboratory.
