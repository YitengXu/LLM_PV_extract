    , Accepted 12th October 2016First published on 12th October 2016AbstractIn aiming to build novel wide band-gap high-performance photovoltaic donor materials, a vertical benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-dicarboxylate (V-BDTC) with a weak electron-withdrawing character was primarily developed. And its wide band-gap (WBG) copolymers PV-BDTC1 and PV-BDTC2 were designed and synthesized, which contain a traditional electron-donating unit of 4,8-disubstituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene (BDT) derivative with diethylhexyloxy for the former and diethylhexylthiophenyl for the latter. It is found that the weak electron-withdrawing V-BDTC unit endows its copolymers with a WBG up to 2.09 eV and a deep HOMO energy level of ∼5.67 eV. Furthermore, PV-BDTC2 exhibits much better photovoltaic properties than PV-BDTC1 in the solution-processing polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.03 V and an increased power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.49%. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE value is the highest level recorded for copolymers with a WBG over 2.0 eV in the PSCs to date, along with a remarkable Voc over 1.0 V. This work provides a feasible strategy to develop a novel promising electron-withdrawing building block and its high-performance WBG copolymers based on the BDT unit.
1 Introduction
Benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has emerged as an effective building block for constructing organic photovoltaic materials since its first reported use in organic solar cells (OSCs).1 As its inherent structural symmetry and rigid fused aromatic system are available to enhance electron delocalization and improve charge mobility,2 a number of efficient photovoltaic copolymers3–7 and small molecules (SMs)8–11 have been developed by incorporating the electron-rich BDT units with other electron-deficient building blocks. High-efficiency photovoltaic materials have been obtained by designing the BDT derivatives used as electron-donating building blocks in OSCs.12–15 For instance, a 5-alkylthiophene-2-yl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDTT) moiety has been used extensively to construct two-dimensional (2D)-conjugated polymers in recent years.12,16,17 In general, the derived BDT moieties are mostly modified with alkyl,18,19 alkoxy4,20 or aryl groups12,13 at their 4,8-positions, and incorporated into their molecular backbone from their 2,6-positions, which can be defined as a paralleled BDT (P-BDT) unit as shown in Fig. 1. There are also a few reports by Yang et al. on photovoltaic materials based on the vertical BDT (V-BDT) moieties modified with electron-rich units from 2,6-positions. It further provided another potential way to construct the D–A alternating copolymers via incorporation from 4,8-positions of V-BDT.21,22 The typical V-BDT based polymers displayed a relatively low HOMO energy level (lower than −5.2 eV) and gave a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.1% reported by Nallan et al., in which the PCE value compares well with that of the reported P-BDT-directed copolymers.23 While most of the effort has been devoted to develop donor units, it is incredible that there is only one record that the BDT unit was modified as an electron-accepting building block to construct conjugated polymers, in which two carboxylate groups were attached into 4,8-positions of the BDT unit to form a paralleled BDT dicarboxylate (BDTC).24 However, these BDTC-based polymers suffered from increasing HOMO levels of over – 4.8 eV and exhibited limited PCEs with a lower Voc value (∼0.5 V) in their solar cells. Therefore, further effort is needed to modify the BDT unit to become an electron-withdrawing unit and further obtain its copolymers with a lower HOMO energy level. Inspired by the case of the vertical BDT as the donor unit, which has made its polymers exhibit a sufficiently decreased HOMO, in this work, we are interested in investigating whether the novel vertical BDTC unit is suitable to use as an electron-withdrawing unit and to construct high-performance copolymers in PSCs.
 Fig. 1  Structural modifications of the BDT unit. 
To this end, a novel accepter unit of vertical BDTC (V-BDTC) was developed by appending dicarboxylate onto 2,6-positions of the BDT unit. Using a copolymerization path-way of 4,8-positions of the V-BDTC unit and diethylhexyloxy (or diethylhexylthiophenyl)-substituted BDT unit, two donor–acceptor alternating copolymers, PV-BDTC1 and PV-BDTC2, have been designed and synthesized. As expected, both V-BDTC-based copolymers display an extremely deep HOMO energy level of −5.56 to −5.67 eV and a very wide optical band gap of 2.07–2.09 eV owing to the weak electron-withdrawing property of the V-BDTC unit and relatively twisted polymer main chains. However, PV-BDTC2 exhibits more improved photovoltaic properties than PV-BDTC1 in the solution-processing polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.03 V and an increased PCE of 7.49%. In principle, an efficient wide band-gap (WBG) polymer (Eg ≥ 1.9 eV) is essential for tandem solar cells to absorb high-energy photons and provide high PCE in subcells.25–27 As WBG materials often suffer from an inherent defect of a narrow absorption, only a few of them have achieved a high PCE over 7%,28–30 in particular when the band-gap exceeds 2.0 eV. We believe that this WBG copolymer of PV-BDTC2 with a high PCE of 7.49% has great potential to be used for tandem cell applications.

2.1 Measurements

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker DPX 400 spectrometer using chloroform-d as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard at resonance frequencies of 400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C at room temperature. The molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymers were determined by Waters 1515 gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using polystyrene as a standard, chloroform (CHCl3) as the eluent at room temperature and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 160 °C. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using a Netzsch TG 209 analyzer at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 up to 600 °C. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed on a TA DSCQ-10 instrument at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 25 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were recorded on a CHI 660 electrochemical workstation with a three-electrode setup containing a working electrode of a platinum rod, a counter electrode of platinum wire and a reference electrode of Ag/AgCl at a scanning rate of 100 mV s−1. The CV measurements were carried out in an anhydrous acetonitrile solution of 0.1 M nitrogen-saturated tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) calibrated with a ferrocene/ferrocenyl couple (Fc/Fc+) at room temperature. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels (EHOMO and ELUMO) were calculated by the following equations: EHOMO = −e(Eox + 4.80)(1) ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg(2)
The theoretical study was performed on the 6-31G** basis set in Gaussian 09 using the density functional theory (DFT), as approximated by the B3LYP. Surface morphologies were recorded by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which was carried out on a FEI Tecnai T20 with LaB6 operated at 200 kV. The polymer/PC71BM blend films used for TEM measurement were placed onto a copper grid. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained by using a NanoMan VS microscope in tapping-mode. The hole/electron mobilities were measured by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method and determined by fitting the dark current to the model of a single carrier SCLC using the Mott–Gurney equation.

Toluene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were distilled according to common methods. Column chromatography was carried out with Merck silica gel (200–300 mesh).

Finally, the monomer M1 was obtained by the well-known Stille coupling reaction and then bromination by NBS according to the procedures reported previously.33

Synthesis of PV-BDTC1. 
In a dry 25 mL flask, monomer M1 (187 mg, 0.2 mmol), BDT (154 mg, 0.2 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (3.2 mg) and P(o-Tol)3 (6.1 mg) were dissolved in degassed toluene (6 mL). The mixture was stirred and heated for 24 h at 100 °C. After cooling down to room temperature, it was dropped into acetone to enable polymer precipitation. The resulting polymer was collected by filtration through a 0.45 μm Teflon filter, dissolved in toluene, and then quickly passed through a short column. Its further purification was carried out by Soxhlet-extraction with methanol, diethyl ether, and then chloroform. The collected chloroform fraction was concentrated to a small volume and precipitated by adding this solution dropwise into acetone. Finally, the polymer was collected by filtration using a 0.45 μm Teflon filter and dried under a vacuum at 40 °C overnight (200 mg, yield 90%). Molecular weight: Mn = 31.7 kDa; Mw/Mn = 2.9.


Synthesis of PV-BDTC2. 
A polymerization procedure similar to that of PV-BDTC1 described above is used to prepare PV-BDTC2. A mixture of M1 (140 mg, 0.15 mmol) and BDTT (136 mg, 0.15 mmol) was polymerized for 24 h to give PV-BDTC2 (150 mg, yield 73%). Molecular weight: Mn = 35.2 kDa; Mw/Mn = 1.7.

2.3 Solar cell fabrication and characterization
A traditional bulk heterojunction sandwich structure was used in the solar cell fabrication. The ITO/glass substrates were ultrasonic-cleaned with detergent, deionizer water, acetone and isopropanol for 15 min each in sequence. The resulting substrates were dried under a stream of nitrogen and subjected to the treatment of Ar/O2 plasma for 5 min. A layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT–PSS) film (40 nm) was spin-coated on ITO and baked at 150 °C for 10 min in a glove box. A blend solution of polymeric donor materials (PV-BDTC1 or PV-BDTC2) and [6,6]-phenyl-C-71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) in o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) was then spun cast onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. The mixing concentration of PV-BDTC1 or PV-BDTC2 is 10 mg mL−1 in DCB. The photoactive layer with an optimal thickness of 90 nm was prepared with different polymer/PC71BM weight ratios and DIO concentrations at 1800 rpm for 40 s. Finally, 20 nm calcium and 100 nm aluminum films were successively deposited on the active layer through a shadow mask at a vacuum pressure of ∼5 × 10−5 Pa to form the top electrode. The active area was 0.04 cm2 for each cell. EQE spectra were recorded in a QEX10 solar cell measurement system. The hole mobilities of PV-BDTC2 in both pure and blend films were investigated by employing the hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/MoO3/polymer (or polymer/PC71BM blend)/MoO3/Al. The electron mobilities of the blend films were investigated in the electron-only devices with a structure of ITO/Al/polymer/PC71BM blend/Al.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and thermal properties
The synthesis route of both V-BDTC based copolymers of PV-BDTC1 and PV-BDTC2 is summarized in Scheme 1. They were obtained in good yields of over 70% by the Stille coupling reaction of trimethylstannyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene derivatives of BDTSnMe3 or BDTTSnMe3 with monomer M1. Both polymers are soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform, toluene and DCB at room temperature. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity (PDI = Mw/Mn) of PV-BDTC1 and PV-BDTC2 are 31.7 kDa (2.93) and 35.2 kDa (1.70) at room temperature, respectively. However, the resulting Mn values decreased to 25.0 kDa for PV-BDTC1 with a PDI value of 1.96 and 32.0 kDa for PV-BDTC2 with a PDI value of 2.04 at 160 °C due to the different molecular aggregation effects. A larger Mn (PDI) difference value between room temperature and 160 °C is exhibited for PV-BDTC1. It implies that PV-BDTC1 exhibits stronger molecular aggregation than PV-BDTC2 at room temperature.

The thermal properties of PV-BDTC1 and PV-BDTC2 are evaluated with TGA and DSC. The recorded TGA and DSC curves are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. The corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. High decomposition temperatures (Td) of 326 °C for PV-BDTC1 and 357 °C for PV-BDTC2 are observed during the heating process at a 5% weight loss. It indicates that PV-BDTC2 exhibits higher thermal stability than PV-BDTC1, because alkoxy groups are eliminated earlier than aryl groups from their parent BDT unit, which is consistent with the observations for other similar systems.34,35 On the other hand, no distinct endothermic and exothermic peaks are exhibited for both polymers during the heating and cooling processes between 50 and 300 °C, as shown in Fig. 2b. It implies that both PV-BDTC1 and PV-BDTC2 tend to present an amorphous state.

3.2 Optical properties

Fig. 3 displays the UV-vis absorption spectra of PV-BDTC1 and PV-BDTC2 in dilute solutions and in their thin films. The absorption maxima are listed in Table 1. Similar absorption spectra are observed for both polymers. Furthermore, these absorption profiles exhibit a red-shifted peak in the low-lying energy region by about 35 nm from solution to solid states. In solutions, PV-BDTC1 and PV-BDTC2 display an absorption peak at 483 nm with a molar extinction coefficient (εmax) of 35 L g−1 cm−1 and 479 nm with a εmax value of 34 L g−1 cm−1, respectively. Obviously, PV-BDTC2 shows a slightly blue-shifted absorption profile compared to PV-BDTC1 in this solution state. It implies that PV-BDTC1 with alkoxyl side chains adopts a slightly more coplanar orientation than PV-BDTC2 with aryl side chains on the BDT unit, which is further supported by the theoretical calculation in Table S1 (see ESI†).

The optical band gaps are estimated to be 2.07 eV for PV-BDTC1 and 2.09 eV for PV-BDTC2 from their absorption band edges (Eoptg) in thin films. Moreover, a very broad absorption window in a range of 300–600 nm with full width at half-maximum (fwhm) values of 186 nm for PV-BDTC1 and 177 nm for PV-BDTC2 is observed at the same time. Some investigations have shown that wide band-gap (WBG) and low band-gap (LBG) polymers can be simultaneously used in polymer tandem solar cells to obtain high performance solar cells, in which the high-energy and the low-energy photons are efficiently absorbed by WBG and LBG polymers, respectively.26,36,37 In this work, such high Eoptg of over 2.0 eV and the absorption feature should endow them with great potential to be used as novel WBG materials.
In order to explore the influence of the acceptor of PC71BM on the absorption of its polymeric blend films, the absorption spectra of the polymer/PC71BM blend films were recorded and are shown in Fig. S1 (see ESI†). In comparison with the absorption spectra of the pure films and the blend films in Fig. 3 and S1,† it is found that the acceptor of PC71BM plays an important role in tuning the photo-response region from 600 nm to 700 nm for the blend films, which should result in the extension of the EQE response. A similar phenomenon was observed for other reported blend films. The large extension of photo-response here should be related to the polymer structure and the D–A interaction between the polymer and PC71BM.38
3.3 Electrochemical properties

Fig. 4 depicts the oxidative curves of PV-BDTC1 and PV-BDTC2 measured by the CV method. A reversible oxidative behavior is observed with onsets of oxidation potential at 0.76 V for PV-BDTC1 and 0.87 V for PV-BDTC2vs. Fc/Fc+, respectively. According to these onsets of oxidation and the energy level of ferrocene (4.8 eV below the vacuum level),39 the HOMO energy levels are estimated at −5.56 eV for PV-BDTC1 and −5.67 eV for PV-BDTC2.
 Fig. 4  The oxidation curves of PV-BDTC1 and PV-BDTC2. 
The electrochemical results reveal that attaching two carboxylate substituents on the BDT unit has made their polymers exhibit lower HOMO energy levels around −5.6 eV, which is available to increase open-circuit voltages (Voc) for their photovoltaic devices. Similar phenomena were also recorded in the literature.40,41 On the other hand, the LUMO energy levels were calculated to be −3.49 and −3.58 eV for PV-BDTC1 and PV-BDTC2, respectively, based on the equation ELUMO = EHOMO + Eoptg. The offset of LUMO energy level between one of the polymers and PC71BM is ∼0.4 eV, which should be able to provide sufficient driving force for exciton dissociation.42
3.4 Theoretical calculations
To further understand the relationship between structures and energy levels of polymers, we performed theoretical simulations of their molecular geometries and frontier orbitals with the hybrid density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level using Gaussian 09W. It is suggested that this method would over-delocalize the wave-functions in conjugated systems and favor more planar structures, but the calculated results are still comparable to some extent as both polymers share the same molecular backbone.43 The optimal geometries and wave functions (HOMO and LUMO) of PV-BDTC1 and PV-BDTC2 are shown in Fig. 5. Furthermore, the dihedral angles of the optimal geometries of PV-BDTC1 and PV-BDTC2 are summarized in Table S1 (see ESI†). It shows that the electron densities of LUMO and HOMO are most localized on the electron-deficient V-BDTC unit and the electron-rich BDT moiety, respectively. In comparison with the LUMO and LUMO+1 orbitals of both polymers, there is little change in the electron density distribution, which reveals the electron-accepting feature of the V-BDTC moiety resulting from the substitution of a dicarboxylate functional group on the vertical BDT unit. A similar phenomenon is also found from HOMO to HOMO−1 owing to the electron-rich property of the BDT unit. Compared to their optimal geometries and dihedral angles of two polymers, it is further found that the dihedral angles between donor BDT and thiophene spacer are 20.39° in PV-BDTC1 and 27.36° in PV-BDTC2. It further confirms that PV-BDTC2 has a slightly twisted polymeric main chain, which is consistent with the results obtained from UV-vis spectra and CV properties.

3.5 Photovoltaic properties
The processing conditions of the bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells based on the polymers of PV-BDTC1 and PV-BDTC2 were preliminarily optimized by varying the polymer/PC71BM weight ratios from 1:1 to 1:2.5 and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive concentrations from 1 % to 4 % (v/v, DIO/o-DCB) under an illumination of AM1.5G simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2. The recorded photovoltaic parameters of these solar cells are summarized in Tables S1 and S2 (see ESI†). It is shown that an optimized PV-BDTC1/PC71BM (or PV-BDTC2/PC71BM) weight ratio was 1:2. However, the DIO additive exerted different influence on photovoltaic performance in the PV-BDTC1 and PV-BDTC2 based cells. An optimized DIO concentration of 3 % was obtained in the PV-BDTC2 based cells only. In contrast, adding DIO made the PV-BDTC1-based cells exhibit lower photovoltaic properties. Fig. 6 depicts the typical current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of two polymers in these devices under optimized processing conditions and the resulting device parameters are summarized in Table 2. A PCE of 3.25% with a Voc of 0.93 V in the PV-BDTC1-based cells and an increased PCE of 5.62% with a Voc of 1.04 V in the PV-BDTC2-based cells are observed at an optimized polymer/PC71BM weight ratio of 1:2 without any post-treatment. When 3% DIO additive is added, a sufficiently enhanced PCE of 7.49% with a greater Jsc of 10.37 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 70.0% is achieved for the PV-BDTC2-based devices except for a slightly decreased Voc of 1.03 V. However, this Voc value over 1.0 V in the PV-BDTC2-based devices is still higher than those of the reported PSCs, which would be ascribed to its deeper HOMO energy level of −5.67 eV. To the best of our knowledge, this PCE value in the PV-BDTC2 based devices represents the highest value so far for PSCs based on polymers with bandgaps over 2.0 eV.

Additionally, an average PCE of 7.33% was further obtained for twenty PV-BDTC2 based devices, indicating that this class of devices has good reproducibility. In order to explore the influence of the PCBM acceptor, the photovoltaic properties of the polymer/PC61BM devices were also examined, and are depicted in Table 2 and Fig. S2 (see ESI†). A lower PCE value was observed for both polymer/PC61BM devices owing to their weaker absorption in the visible region compared to the polymer/PC71BM devices. In comparison with all these devices, the PV-BDTC2/PC71BM device exhibited the best photovoltaic properties no matter whether the acceptor material was PC71BM or PC61BM. The recorded EQE curves of the optimized polymer/PC71BM and polymer/PC61BM blend films under illumination of monochromatic light, as respectively shown in Fig. 6b and S2,† further support the fact that PV-BDTC2 exhibits better photovoltaic performance than PV-BDTC1 in the devices. The photo-response wave-length ranges of the EQE curves were consistent with the UV-vis absorption ranges for the polymer/PC71BM blend films (see Fig. S1†). The maximum EQE values of 78% and 50% are respectively observed for the PV-BDTC2/PC71BM and PV-BDTC1/PC71BM blend films, which are higher than the corresponding values for the PV-BDTC2/PC61BM and PV-BDTC1/PC61BM blend films. The measured Jsc values of 10.10 and 5.75 mA cm−2 respectively in the PV-BDTC2 and PV-BDTC1 based devices here agree well with the Jsc values estimated from the EQE characteristics. Therefore, the higher photo-response efficiency of the PV-BDTC2/PC71BM blend film can enable its solar cells to exhibit higher Jsc values, and hence better photovoltaic performance.
3.6 Film morphology and charge mobility
To analyze the origin of photovoltaic performance differences between the PV-BDTC1- and PV-BDTC2-based solar cells, we carried out an investigation on the morphologies of the polymer/PC71BM blend films by TEM. Fig. 7 shows the TEM images of these polymer/PC71BM blend films with/without a 3 % DIO solvent additive at a polymer/PC71BM weight ratio of 1:2. A nanoscale phase separation of the polymer and PC71BM is observed in both polymer/PC71BM blend films without any DIO additive. The fibrillar-like light regions are attributed to the polymer aggregation.44
 Fig. 7  TEM images of the polymer/PC71BM blend films at a D/A weight ratio of 1:2 with or without a DIO additive. 
It is clear that the PV-BDTC2/PC71BM blend film exhibits a smaller domain size than the PV-BDTC1/PC71BM blend film, which can provide a larger interface area for efficient exciton diffusion and charge separation. This can explain why the PV-BDTC2-based devices show higher Jsc and FF than the PV-BDTC1-based devices without the DIO additive. When DIO is employed, in the case of PV-BDTC1, the size of polymer/PC71BM domains instead increases, which should limit the donor/acceptor interface and result in a decreased performance.45,46 In contrast, in the case of PV-BDTC2, a more uniform image with a better bicontinuous morphology is observed in the presence of 3 wt% DIO; this is also confirmed by the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images showing interpenetrating networks (see ESI Fig. S2†), thus giving rise to remarkably increased FF and PCE values.
To further understand the device performance differences of the PV-BDTC2-based solar cells with/without a DIO additive, the charge transport behaviors for hole and electron mobilities were deduced from the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements.47Fig. 8 shows the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics and SCLC fittings of these hole- and electron-only devices. The corresponding hole and electron mobilities are summarized in Table 3. A hole mobility (μh) of 8.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, an electron mobility (μe) of 2.28 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, as well as a μe/μh value of 2.77 are observed in the PV-BDTC2/PC71BM based hole- and electron-only devices, respectively. When 3 wt% DIO was added, the μh and μe values increased to 9.7 × 10−4 and 2.32 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a μe/μh value of 2.38, respectively. It is clear that more balanced charge carrier mobility is achieved in the devices in the presence of 3 wt% DIO. The increasing carrier mobility and less charge recombination loss should be mainly responsible for the improvement in Jsc and overall performance.48,49

4 Conclusion
In summary, a novel vertical dicarboxylate substituted benzodithiophene of V-BDTC was primarily used as an electron-withdrawing building block to construct D–A copolymers. Its copolymers of PV-BDTC1 and PV-BDTC2 with alkoxy- and thiophenyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDT) units were obtained, respectively. Wide band gaps of 2.07–2.09 eV with remarkable deep HOMO levels of −5.56 to −5.67 eV were observed in both copolymers. However, better photovoltaic properties were exhibited by the PV-BDTC2-based solar cells with an impressive PCE of up to 7.49% and a high Voc of 1.03 V at a PV-BDTC2/PC71BM weight ratio of 1:2 and a DIO concentration of 3 wt%. Their relatively wide optical band gap over 2.0 eV with high absorption coefficient, high hole mobility, very balanced hole/electron mobility, and excellent morphology of the PV-BDTC2/PC71BM blend film are responsible for the remarkably improved photovoltaic performance of the PV-BDTC2-based solar cells. The PCE maximum with a high Voc over 1.0 V obtained in this work is the highest level recorded for the conventional BHJ PSCs based on WBG (>2.0 eV) polymers. The work provides a feasible strategy to develop a novel family of the BDT-based D–A copolymers. It further indicates that V-BDTC is a potential electron-deficient building block in D–A-type copolymers and PV-BDTC2 is a promising WBG donor material for high-performance PSCs. Interestingly, there remains considerable scope to fully explore the potential of the V-BDTC-based copolymers in photovoltaic applications, such as choosing more suitable donor units to construct novel copolymers, optimizing the device processing technique and using in tandem solar cells.
