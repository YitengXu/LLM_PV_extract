    , Accepted 19th May 2022First published on 21st May 2022AbstractIt is imperative to advance the structural design of conjugated materials to achieve a practical impact on the performance of photovoltaic devices. However, the effect of the linkage positions (meta-, para-) of the backbone on the molecular packing has been relatively little explored. In this study, we have synthesized two wide-bandgap polymer photovoltaic materials from identical monomers with different linkage positions, using dibenzo[c,h][2,6]-naphthyridine-5,11-(6H,12H)-dione (DBND) as the building block. This study shows that the para-connected polymer exhibits an unexpected 0.2 eV higher ionization potential and a resultant higher open-circuit voltage than the meta-connected counterpart. We found that different linkage positions result in different intermolecular binding energies and molecular aggregation conformations, leading to different HOMO energy levels and photovoltaic performances. Specifically, theoretical calculations and 2D-NMR indicate that P(p-DBND-f-2T) performs a segregated stacking of f-2T and DBND units, while P(m-DBND-f-2T) films form π-overlaps between f-2T and DBND. These results show that linkage position adjustment on the polymeric backbone exerts a profound influence on the molecular aggregation of the materials. Also, the effect of isomerism on the polymer backbone is crucial in designing polymer structures for photovoltaic applications.
Introduction
Donor (D)–acceptor (A) conjugated semiconducting polymers are attracting significant attention in the applications of organic photovoltaics (OPVs).1–5 Optimizing the structures of D–A type polymers in thin active layers to achieve higher crystallinity,6,7 appropriate molecule arrangement orientation,8–10 and nanoscale phase separation networks,11–13 to promote photoinduced electron transfer in the active bulk layer, is universally acknowledged as a critical process to achieve better photovoltaic performance. Therefore, it is critically important to understand the relationship between polymer structure and its corresponding assembling behavior. Several design strategies have been reported in the literature, such as unit symmetry,14–18 side-chain engineering,19–22 number and location of halogen substitution,23–26 and conformation-lock engineering using intramolecular dynamic non-covalent bonds.27–29
Altering the polymer backbone linkage positions can affect the light absorption or emitting properties; thus, such engineering has been used in organic photoelectric materials or sensors.30–32 Working on bulk heterojunction-polymer solar cells, Li et al.33 synthesized two conjugated polymers composed of a 2D building block dibenzophenazine linking a polymeric backbone employing either benzene or phenanthrene. This research found that even for the conjugated polymers constructed from the identical monomers, it exhibited redshifted UV-vis absorption when the connection was on benzene, which eventually yielded a higher photovoltaic performance. Yan et al.34 reported a polymer-based study using benzodithiophene and difluorinated triazole units. They used the connecting positions on the flanking thiophenes compared to the conventional PBFTAZ.35 This study showed a blue-shifted UV-vis absorption but a higher HOMO energy level than that of PBFTAZ. Ramamurthy studies the α or β position of polymerization on the BODIPY unit,36 showing that the α connected polymer exhibits delocalized LUMO orbitals and a better electron acceptor property. These studies have enhanced our understanding of the conjugated polymer structures and their physical properties. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, few studies have been reported concerning the effect of backbone linkage position and the in-depth to the molecular aggregation behavior and the corresponding influence on photovoltaic performance.
In this paper, we report a systematical investigation of the relationship between altering the linkage position of two conjugated polymeric backbones and the influence on their aggregation behavior and photovoltaic performance, as shown in Scheme 1. Two wide-bandgap conjugated polymers, meta- and para-polymerization, based on the dibenzo[c,h][2,6]-naphthyridine-5,11-(6H,12H)-dione (DBND) acceptor units were designed and thoroughly investigated. Compared to the meta-polymerized polymer (to the N atom, denoted as P(m-DBND-f-2T)), the para-polymerized polymer (P(p-DBND-f-2T)) exhibits an unexpected 0.2 eV lower HOMO energy level in the film. Therefore, it yields a higher open-circuit voltage (VOC) for the corresponding OPV performance.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures of the designed polymers. 
We have investigated the significant differences in the HOMO energy levels in detail, understood as follows: when altering the linkage position of the polymers, their crystallinity and aggregation-conformation would be affected, which eventually led to different HOMO energy levels of the materials. For example, P(p-DBND-f-2T) displays a segregated stacking of f-2T and DBND units with relatively lower crystallinity. On the other hand, P(m-DBND-f-2T) performed an aggregation with the DBND unit overlap with the f-2T unit.
Results and discussion
General characterization of the conjugated polymers
As shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†), we synthesized two conjugated polymers, starting from either meta-dibromo isoindigo or para-dibromo isoindigo, to investigate the influence of the backbone linkage position on the physical property of DBND based polymers.37–39 The molecular weights of the polymers were determined via gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent at 150 °C after calibration against polystyrene standards, and Table 1 lists the average molecular weights (Mn) and the polydispersity index (PDI). We obtained P(m-DBND-f-2T) and P(p-DBND-f-2T) under the same polymerization conditions exhibiting high Mn up to 203 kDa and 178 kDa.

It is interesting to note that the two polymers provided different solutions, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). At room temperature, P(m-DBND-f-2T) exhibits an orange colorant in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). In contrast, P(p-DBND-f-2T) forms a yellow solution at the same concentration, indicating unlike light absorption behaviours of these two polymers. Altering the backbone linkage positions sometimes leads to cross-conjugated polymers. As is studied using isoindigo based polymers, the researcher found that the cross-conjugated polymers exhibit barely any red-shift of the optical absorption compared to the monomer, interpreted as intramolecular charge redistribution hampered in cross-conjugated polymers.40,41 As shown from UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 1), our polymers exhibit a large red-shift of about 150 nm in dilute solution compared to the DBND monomer, which reflects the internal charge redistribution affected by the donor and acceptor units, and the formation of full-conjugated structures. The maximum absorption wavelength of P(m-DBND-f-2T) is around 503 nm, 18 nm redshifted compared to P(p-DBND-f-2T), suggesting that meta-polymerization promotes good D–A interactions. When forming films from polymer solutions, there is a noticeably increased intensity of the shoulder peaks (relative to its maxima), especially for P(p-DBND-f-2T), indicating the formation of a more planar polymer configuration due to the suppression from intermolecular π–π stacking.42

For the studied polymers, we determined the energy gaps (Eg) and HOMO/LUMO energy levels from the onset of the UV-vis spectra and the cyclic voltammetry diagrams of the corresponding thin films (Fig. 1b and c), as listed in Table 1. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of P(m-DBND-f-2T) and P(p-DBND-f-2T) were calculated to be 2.32 eV and 2.37 eV, respectively. Unexpectedly, although constructed with identical building blocks, the ionization potential (IP, an estimation of the HOMO energy level) of the P(p-DBND-f-2T) is determined to be 5.61 eV, much higher than that of the meta-polymerized counterpart (5.42 eV). The higher IP of P(p-DBND-f-2T) confirmed the low lying HOMO energy level, showing that altering the linkage position has a profound influence on the HOMO energy level over Eoptg in this case. We measured the IP of both polymers at the material level, where intermolecular interactions broaden the molecular energy levels into electronic bands.43 Despite using identical building blocks, altering the linkage position may change the polymer backbone configuration, which would affect the aggregation structures and electronic couplings between adjacent molecules and, therefore, yield different molecular energy levels.

Fig. 1d shows the crystallinity of the polymers in the out-of-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the neat films. Due to the similarity of the molecular structures, the two polymers exhibit similar patterns with prominent lamellar stacking peaks. The calculated π–π distances are also the same as 3.83 Å. However, P(m-DBND-f-2T) shows more substantial 100 lamellar stacking peaks than P(p-DBND-f-2T), indicating that the neat films of meta-polymerized polymers exhibit improved crystallinity. Bredas43 noted that wave function delocalization (or localization) varies with intermolecular electronic couplings and disordering. For example, a higher level of crystallinity in P(m-DBND-f-2T) promoted wave function delocalization (over neighboring molecules) and elevated the measured HOMO energy levels.
Discussion with theoretical calculation and (2D) NMR characterization
To explain the different optical and electrochemical properties of meta- and para-connected polymers, we performed DFT calculations. Specifically, we used the ωB97XD functional to describe the LUMO/HOMO energy levels of oligomers (n = 2) for simplicity and presented the results in Fig. 2a. The calculated bandgap of the P(m-DBND-f-2T) oligomer is 5.41 eV, which is 0.05 eV narrower than the case of P(p-DBND-f-2T). The trend is consistent with the Eoptg. However, the calculated P(p-DBND-f-2T) exhibits a slightly higher HOMO energy level than P(m-DBND-f-2T), which is in contrast to the CV results that P(p-DBND-f-2T) shows a much larger IP value. Because polymer aggregation promotes the delocalization of wave functions, we believe that the drastic difference in the HOMO energy levels between two polymers (measured from electrochemical analysis) may result from their strikingly different aggregation behaviors which cannot be simulated from a single molecule. To explore more in detail in this direction, we have studied the model polymers of weak intermolecular interactions with repeating units, e.g., m-DBND-f-2T and p-DBND-f-2T. We have employed the DFT method with empirical dispersion corrections and thermal corrections to perform the calculations, and isobutyl groups replaced the long alkyl chains. From the calculations and analysis, we found several local minima from different starting structures. We summarized, in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†), the structures and intermolecular binding free energies (IBE) of bimolecular dimers. Overall, the m-DBND-f-2T exhibits a larger IBE. Fig. 2 shows the most thermodynamically stable structures, where the IBE of m-DBND-f-2T is −68.4 kcal mol−1, which is larger than that of p-DBND-f-2T (−64.9 kcal mol−1). The more potent binding energy of meta-connected repeating units led to more robust interchain aggregation and polymer crystallinity, consistent with the results of the XRD studies.

As shown in Fig. 2, m-DBND-f-2T and p-DBND-f-2T prefer significantly different spatial molecular organizations. In m-DBND-f-2T, the DBND units contact more strongly with f-2T units than with one another. The molecular backbone shows a planar conformation; on the country, p-DBND-f-2T favors more of an overlap between two DBND units. Furthermore, a tortile-molecular spine with a dihedral angle up to 21.5° between the DBND core and thiophene ring is observed in p-DBND-f-2T. A larger torsion angle leads to poor intramolecular conjugate interactions and reduces the HOMO energy levels.44
Meanwhile, different packing conformations also lead to other intermolecular electronic couplings. The calculated HOMO value of the m-DBND-f-2T dimer is −5.73 eV, which is higher than that of the p-DBND-f-2T dimer (−5.80 eV). Hence, the polymer aggregation organization of P(p-DBND-f-2T) may be another reason for its low lying HOMO energy levels.
Solid-state NMR is a powerful approach for studying molecular spatial arrangements of crystalline and amorphous morphs in conjugated polymers.45–50 We understand that polymer aggregation and molecular arrangement are the sources of the discrepancy in the HOMO energy levels. We acquired two-dimensional (2D) NMR correlation spectra of isotropic 1H and 13C chemical shifts, utilizing the short-range nuclear dipole–dipole interactions to probe the spatial proximity of polymer groups and reveal any intermolecular contacts. Fig. 3 shows the 2D 13C{1H} FSLG-HETCOR NMR correlation spectra of the P(p-DBND-f-2T) and the P(m-DBND-f-2T). Correlations between directly bonded 1H and 13C resonances are shown by the cross-section of the lines drawn from the same notes on the 1H and 13C axes in the aromatic region.

From Fig. 3, we can identify several correlations resulting from the significant differences in intermolecular interaction between P(p-DBND-f-2T) and P(m-DBND-f-2T). For P(p-DBND-f-2T), Fig. 3a displays a characteristic correlation between C6 at 180 ppm and a proton of H3 or H2. Additional strong contacts are also found between C1 of the thiophene group (110 ppm) and H5 of the side chains. These observations suggest a probable spatial molecular organization between two DBND units of neighboring P(p-DBND-f-2T) molecules: each DBND unit appears to have been shifted 45° from the direction of the polymer backbone to its closest neighbor (see Fig. 4a).

Schematics (b) of stacked polymer chains illustrating a greater overlap of DBND units in the case of P(p-DBND-f-2T) compared to the more intermixed DBND and f-2T units in the case of P(m-DBND-f-2T), as suggested by intermolecular contacts derived from their respective solid-state 2D-NMR spectra. 
In contrast, the intermolecular 1H and 13C resonances of C6 are not present in the spectrum of P(m-DBND-f-2T). And specifically, in Fig. 3b, aside from the H5 connection with C1, a correlation between H5 and carbons on the DBND unit around 120 ppm shows up, designated by a blue hollow circle. We provided one of the possible stacking structures, as is shown in Fig. 4a, where two protons of H5 correlate with C1 and C2, respectively. Of course, P(m-DBND-f-2T) may be constructed for more than one spatial arrangement under the complicated correlation between H1, H2, H3 and C2, C3, C8, which are not easy to identify. Multiple local molecular organizations have also been observed for copolymers of NDI and bithiophene by controlling preparation conditions. Based on the characterization of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, two different polymorphs were studied as NDI units on one polymer stacking, either with bithiophene or with another NDI on the adjacent polymer.51
In summary, despite some discrepancies, the tendency of the polymer spatial arrangements displayed by the (2D) NMR results in good qualitative agreement with the theoretical calculations, indicating that P(p-DBND-f-2T) and P(m-DBND-f-2T) exhibit different π-overlap in the solid state. Similar results have also been found for copolymers of Isoindigo and thiophene or terthiophene. Reynolds et al.52 found that the balance of the size between the donor and acceptor portions of the backbone repeat unit substantially impacts polymer spatial arrangements. The tendency to pack between Isoindigo and the donor portion evolves with the donor size extended from thiophene to terthiophene. In the present study, despite the similar size of DBND and f-2T units, we found that altering the linkage position could also change the polymer spatial arrangement, which may affect the HOMO energy levels of the material.
To better understand the difference in optical properties between the two polymers, we have also calculated the Gibbs free energy change corresponding to the aromatic–quinoidal equilibrium for the meta- and para-connected polymer repeat unit, which is presented in Fig. 5a. In all cases, the open-shell bi-radical aromatic structures showed lower energy levels than those of the closed-shell singlet quinoidal structures, which was the source of the stability of the sizeable aromatic DBND core. However, the aromatic structures of p-DBND-f-2T showed a complex transformation to form quinoidal structures with a ΔG of around 40.6 kcal mol−1. Meanwhile, the tendency of m-DBND-f-2T is much easier with a ΔG of approximately 35.8 kcal mol−1, indicating that the quinoidal structures of P(m-DBND-f-2T) are more stable than P(p-DBND-f-2T). This result is consistent with the low lying LUMO energy levels of the m-DBND-f-2T dimer than p-DBND-f-2T as is shown in Table 1. The electron density of the LUMO is well-delocalized in the m-DBND-f-2T dimer over the para-counterpart which implies the significance of intramolecular characteristics (Fig. 2a). The strong quinoidal stabilization in the symmetric meta-linkaged P(m-DBND-f-2T) reduced the band gap through LUMO stabilization, whereas the asymmetric π-delocalization of P(p-DBND-f-2T) fails to stabilize the quinoidal form.

The theoretical calculation and analysis are further confirmed by the bond length variation from the open-shell bi-radical aromatic structures to the corresponding quinoidal structures. The minimized bond length alternation pattern between aromatic and quinoidal in a conjugated system has been observed by engendering smaller energy gaps, such as thienoisoindigo,53 thiazoloisoindigo,54 thienothiophene,55 benzodipyrrolidones,56 and azaquinodimethane.57 In this case, altering the linkage position led to different electronic quinoidal structures between P(m-DBND-f-2T) and P(p-DBND-f-2T). Fig. 5b shows the effect of six bonds in the pyridine ring of DBND, where the characteristic bonds undergo different length alternations between aromatic and quinoidal. This reflects that m-DBND-f-2T exhibited an entirely less significant bond length alternation than p-DBND-f-2T, consistent with a narrower Eoptg.
Photovoltaic properties and morphology characterization
Considering the different HOMO energy levels and Eoptg, Table 2 provided the performance of solution-processed bulk heterojunction devices (device structure: ITO/V2O5/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al), and Fig. 6 presented the analyzed results. Compared with the meta-polymerized counterpart, which exhibits a VOC of 0.98 V, P(p-DBND-f-2T) indicates a higher VOC up to 1.02 V due to the higher IP value. P(p-DBND-f-2T) also shows a somewhat higher average short-circuit current (JSC) of 6.88 mA cm−2 than P(m-DBND-f-2T) (6.59 mA cm−2), which is consistent with the outcomes of SCLC (Fig. S5, ESI†): blended films obtained from P(p-DBND-f-2T) polymers show hole mobility (calculated from SCLC) of 1.5 times as much as P(m-DBND-f-2T). The JSC values of both polymers are confirmed by their external quantum efficiency (EQE). The EQE curves of P(m-DBND-f-2T) and P(p-DBND-f-2T) exhibit an apparent response between 300 nm and 550 nm, which agrees with their absorption spectra. The measured responses of 560 to 700 nm come from the contribution of the absorption of fullerene.

Despite the distinct optical and electronic properties, P(m-DBND-f-2T) and P(p-DBND-f-2T) display comparable average power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 4.53% and 4.66%, respectively. This observation suggests that they may have similar morphologies in the blended films. As evidenced by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), both polymers exhibit a well-defined nano-fibril network with polymer domains of about 30 nm in width.
Compared to P(p-DBND-f-2T), P(m-DBND-f-2T) exhibits redshifted light absorption and higher crystallinity, promoting photon harvest and benefiting charge transfer. However, P(p-DBND-f-2T) presents a higher JSC and hole mobility average, indicating that polymer spatial arrangements could affect the charge transfer behavior. A similar result is also supported by many other studies, e.g., by isoindigo52 or the benzothiadiazole49,58 systems. It was found that a more significant overlap of the electron-accepting units of a D–A conjugated polymer can achieve higher n-type mobility. Therefore, we propose that polymer aggregation control effectively achieves higher material properties, and the linkage position adjustment deserves added attention.
Due to the relatively limited light absorption window, the wide-bandgap polymers of P(m-DBND-f-2T) and P(p-DBND-f-2T) do not exhibit a competitive OPV performance as the recent popular materials. However, in the optical absorption region (350–550 nm), P(m-DBND-f-2T) and P(p-DBND-f-2T) are a perfect complement to the materials that are lacking optical absorption spectra of the high-performance, for example, the J52, PM6, or PTB7-Th, which makes the DBND based polymer a promising candidate for tandem (or multijunction) devices as an additional donor with complementary absorption spectra.59
Conclusions
In summary, DBND-based polymers provide us with an opportunity to investigate the effects of meta- and para-connections of polymer backbones on the photovoltaic properties of the corresponding polymers. We found that altering the backbone linkage position results in different polymeric aggregation behavior. Theoretical calculation and analysis show that different linkage positions lead to different IBEs and backbone planarity of the resulting polymers in aggregation. Compared with P(m-DBND-f-2T), P(p-DBND-f-2T) exhibits a relatively lower crystallinity and a tortile molecular conformation in stacking. Moreover, theoretical calculations and 2D-NMR results confirm that different linkage positions lead to different polymer spatial arrangements. P(p-DBND-f-2T) displays intermolecular packing with the DBND units in contact with each other, while P(m-DBND-f-2T) has a conformation with the DBND unit overlapped with the f-2T unit. As a consequence, P(p-DBND-f-2T) yielded an IP of 5.61 eV that was almost 0.2 eV higher than that of P(m-DBND-f-2T). On the other hand, meta- and para-polymerization lead to different electronic quinoidal structures of conjugated polymers. P(m-DBND-f-2T) exhibits smaller bond length alternation between aromatic and quinoidal forms, which could be beneficial to reduce energy gaps. Finally, the P(p-DBND-f-2T) based device revealed a higher VOC up to 1.02 V and PCE of 4.84%, while the P(m-DBND-f-2T) based device exhibits a VOC of 0.98 V and PCE of 5.05%. These results suggest that linkage position adjustment on the polymeric backbone profoundly influences the outcome of the molecular spatial arrangements, and warrants further studies on the design of D–A type conjugated polymers for high-performance photovoltaic devices.
Experimental section
General procedures
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves were measured by drop-casting a polymer film on the working electrode. The measurements were performed on an electrochemistry workstation (CHI660D, Chenhua Shanghai) in anhydrous argon saturated acetonitrile solution (10−3 mol L−1) of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) at room temperature by a three-electrode system, which utilizes glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode, Pt as the counter electrode, and Hg/Hg2Cl2 as the reference electrode. The potential of the reference electrode in acetonitrile was identified by using ferrocene as an internal standard. The UV-vis spectra were collected with a Hitachi U-4100 UV-vis spectrophotometer in an anhydrous o-dichlorobenzene solution (2.5 × 10−5 mol L−1) or on a piezoid spin-coated with the polymer solution. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed with a Waters 1151 pump and UV-vis monitor (700 nm) using 1,2,4-tricholorobenzene (TCB) as the eluent (150 °C). Bright field transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data were acquired using a HITACHI H-7650 electron microscope. XRD patterns were investigated with a Bruker D8-advance X-ray diffractometer. Samples were prepared drop-casting on Si substrates with annealing at 100 °C for 30 minutes. Solid-state NMR spectra were attained from a Bruker AVANCE NEO 800 MHz FT-NMR spectrometer with a MASSB-TR-H/C/N 3.2 mm Efree DVT Probehead at 298 K. The calculations were performed by using the unrestricted DFT method with the ωB97XD functionals in the Gaussian 09 program. Geometry optimizations were performed using the ωB97XD functional and 6-31g(d) basis set. The analytical Hessians at the same level of theory as the geometry optimization were carried out to obtain the thermal corrections to the Gibbs free energy. The Grimme's empirical D3 dispersion corrections were also added at single points, which may play rather important roles in the calculations of large complexes. Spin densities derived from Mulliken population analysis were used to verify that a correct electronic state has been constructed. Unless otherwise stated, all the final free energies presented in this study were obtained from the ωB97XD/6-31g(d) level together with a thermal correction to the Gibbs free energy calculated using the ωB97XD/6-31g(d) method and Grimme's empirical D3 dispersion corrections. Both antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic coupling of the unpaired spins on the complex were also investigated.
Device fabrication and characterization
Conventional OPVs were fabricated, and the device structures are shown as follows: ITO/V2O5/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. ITO-coated glass was ultrasonically washed in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and 2-propanol sequentially for 20 min each. Afterward, the cleaned ITO-coated glass was exposed to oxygen plasma to remove organic contaminants and to increase the size of the wetting envelope. The V2O5 layer was prepared through spin-coating a vanadium (V) triisopropoxide oxide alcohol solution (2.5% (v/v)) at 4000 rpm on ITO substrates and was then treated under O2 plasma for 10 min, without the need for hydrolysis with moisture, or annealed. Subsequently, the modified ITO-coated glass was moved to the glovebox. Polymers and PC71BM were dissolved in o-DCB. The solution was stirred overnight at room temperature and then heated for 1 h at 100 °C before being spin coated on V2O5 modified ITO-coated glass to form the active layer. The devices were then coated with Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) (as the cathode) via a shadow mask at a 10−4 Pa vacuum. The thickness of the active layer was controlled by changing the spin speed or solution concentration and was estimated using a Veeco Dektak 150 surface profiler. The device area was 0.1 cm2 defined by a shadow mask. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OPVs were recorded using a Keithley 2420 source measurement unit under the illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2, Newport solar simulator). Light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell. The external quantum efficiencies of solar cells were analyzed using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system. Hole mobility was measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model with the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag by taking the current–voltage in the range of 0–5 V and fitting the results to a space charge limited form for a hole-only device. In the presence of carrier traps in the active layer, a trap-filled-limit (TFL) region exists between the ohmic and trap-free SCLC regions. The SCLC behavior in the trap-free region can be characterized by using the Mott–Gurney equation,  where ε is the static dielectric constant of the medium and μ is the carrier mobility, L is the polymer thickness, and V is the voltage drop across the device. V = Vapp − Vbi − Vs, where Vapp is the voltage applied to the device, and Vbi is the built-in voltage resulting from the relative work function difference between the two electrodes, VS is the voltage drop due to the contact resistance and series resistance across the electrodes.
