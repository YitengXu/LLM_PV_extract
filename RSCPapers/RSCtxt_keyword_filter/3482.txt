However, the correlation between side-chain structures and photovoltaic properties is still unclear. Here, we have investigated the local interface morphologies of PC71BM blended with two donors, DR3TBDT and DR3TSBDT with alkyloxy and alkylthio side chains on the BDT core, by means of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Compared with alkyloxy, alkylthio exhibits larger steric hindrance after changing the side-chain anchoring atom from oxygen to sulfur, leading to an obvious reduction of the PC71BM–BDT face-on orientations in which charge recombination is demonstrated to be the most severe by quantum-chemical calculations. This suggests that the performance of DR3TBDT/PC71BM solar cells is likely to be more affected by charge recombination than that of DR3TSBDT/PC71BM-based devices. For the first time, our work unravels the important role of side-chain anchoring atoms in tuning the donor/fullerene interfacial arrangements toward high-performance organic solar cells.
Introduction
Solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have made great strides in the past decade with the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) already exceeding the 10% milestone.1–6 This significant improvement is due to the great efforts in the rational design of molecular structures and device optimization.7–13 In particular, it has been recognized that manipulating the donor/fullerene intermolecular arrangement, i.e., local interface morphology in the active layer is critical to maximize exciton dissociation (ED) and charge separation (CS) and to minimize charge recombination (CR).14–17 These intermolecular charge-transfer (CT) processes are highly relevant to the photovoltaic performance.18,19
To achieve solution processing of conjugated polymers or small molecules in organic solvents, alkyl side chains are necessary to append to the conjugated backbones. It is well established that these substituents can strongly influence structural order and charge transport properties.12,20–27 However, it still remains experimentally difficult to directly probe the details of donor/fullerene packing in the mixed region considering a three-phase structure in high-performance BHJ OSCs,28 even to characterize the preferential orientations (face-on or edge-on) at the interface.17 Consequently, the role of side-chain modifications, e.g. different lengths, branching patterns, anchoring atoms, and substitution positions, in tuning donor–fullerene intermolecular interactions has not been fully understood.16,20,23,29
Introducing electron-donating side chains, such as alkyloxy and alkylthio, has become a very common and useful strategy to modulate the optoelectronic properties of organic photovoltaic donor materials in recent years.12,30–39 Most interestingly, the different anchoring atoms of alkyloxy and alkylthio groups (oxygen and sulfur) could lead to distinct photovoltaic performances. For instance, compared with its dialkyloxy-substituted counterpart, a dialkylthio-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) homopolymer exhibited a much higher PCE increasing from 1.56% to 4%, along with improved open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current (JSC), and fill factor (FF).38 For the BHJ OSCs based on the PC71BM acceptor in conjugation with DR3TBDT and DR3TSBDT (see Fig. 1), two small-molecule donors with BDT as the core and terthiophene end-capped with a rhodanine electron-withdrawing group as two arms, although VOC was almost unchanged when the alkyloxy side chains on BDT were replaced by alkylthio, the improvements in both JSC and FF resulted in a remarkable increase of PCE from 7.38% to 9.95%.30,31

In this study, we have comparatively investigated the local interface morphologies of DR3TBDT/PC71BM and DR3TSBDT/PC71BM blends by means of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our simulations show that with respect to alkyloxy, alkylthio side chains exhibit more severe steric hindrance, leading to a dramatic reduction of the probability of docking PC71BM with BDT in face-on orientations for the DR3TSBDT/PC71BM blend. Further electronic-structure calculations based on the donor/fullerene complexes extracted from the MD simulations demonstrate that charge recombination is the fastest for the PC71BM–BDT face-on orientations among all types of orientations. Our results imply that the performance of DR3TBDT/PC71BM BHJs is likely to be more affected by charge recombination than that of DR3TSBDT/PC71BM-based devices. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first molecular insight into the importance of side-chain anchoring atoms in tuning the donor/fullerene intermolecular arrangements and charge-transfer processes for improving photovoltaic performance.
Computational methods
MD simulations
All the all-atom MD simulations were based on a modified general AMBER force field40 (Fig. S1†) with the RESP charges41 and were carried out using the Gromacs-4.6.7 software package.42 The missing torsion potential parameters were derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-311G** level (Fig. S2†). Girifalco's parameters were employed to describe the van der Waals (vdW) interactions for the fullerene aromatic carbons,43 as reported in a previous study on modelling PC61BM organization.44 A spherical cut-off of 1.2 nm for the summation of VDW and real-space electrostatic interactions and the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) solver for long-range electrostatic interactions were used throughout. The simulations were performed under the NPT ensemble by means of the leap-frog integrator with a time step of 1 fs and under three-dimensional periodic boundary conditions.
The donor/fullerene blends were simulated by the following procedure (Fig. S3†): (1) randomly placing the molecules in a large box (25 × 25 × 25 nm3) to generate an initial model (seeding); (2) 5 ns of simulation at 600 K and 100 bar to bring molecules close together (compression); (3) 600 K and 1 bar for 10 ns, then cooling from 600 K down to 300 K gradually within 3 ns (thermal annealing); (4) 20 ns of simulation at 300 K and 1 bar (equilibration). The final box size is about 8.48 nm in three dimensions for both blending systems. The velocity rescaling thermostat45 and the Berendsen barostat46 were applied for the temperature and pressure control, except for the final 10 ns of equilibration; the Nosé–Hoover thermostat47,48 and the Parrinello–Rahman barostat49 were used to obtain better equilibrium configurations.
Here, it should be noted that although the domain sizes of separated donor and acceptor phases in BHJ are strongly dependent on the choice of solvents and solvent additives, the local interface morphologies rely mainly on the intermolecular interactions between donor and acceptor molecules. To further elucidate the influence of solvents on the local interface morphology, we have also simulated the solution processing of blend films via non-equilibrium MD simulations, as we did previously.50 The simulation details are provided in the ESI (Fig. S4†).
Electronic-structure calculations
In the framework of the Marcus electron-transfer theory,51 electronic coupling is one of the key parameters to control the dynamics of exciton-dissociation and charge-recombination processes.52–54 Based on the final equilibrium MD simulations, the DR3TBDT/PC71BM and DR3TSBDT/PC71BM complexes were extracted for the electronic coupling calculations when the shortest inter-atomic (except hydrogen) distance between the donor conjugated backbone and the PC71BM cage is less than 5 Å. The last 500 ps of equilibration was sampled every 5 ps to produce 100 snapshots to consider the thermal fluctuation effect. Following our previous studies,54–57 we computed the electronic couplings for exciton dissociation of the local excited state on the donor into the lowest three CT states with close energies (an effective coupling was achieved as the square root of sum of the squares) and electronic couplings for charge recombination of the lowest CT state to the ground state using a diabatic-state approach at the INDO/MRCI level of theory.58 The coulomb repulsion term was described by the Mataga–Nishimoto potential.59,60 All the π-type molecular orbitals were considered to build the CI active space. The binding energy of the lowest CT state was estimated as the Coulombic interaction between the donor cation and the acceptor anion with the dielectric constant set to 4.0 and the atomic partial charges obtained via an INDO Mulliken population analysis.
Results and discussion
In order to elucidate the steric hindrance of the side chains to fullerene, it is useful to characterize the bending angle θ and torsion angle ψ of the side chains relative to the backbone core BDT (see Fig. 2a). It can be expected that if θ becomes smaller and/or ψ is closer to 90°, the side chains will provide a bigger steric hindrance. First, we optimized the molecular geometries of DR3TBDT and DR3TSBDT by DFT at the B3LYP/6-31G** level. Obviously, θ is considerably smaller for DR3TSBDT (102°) than for DR3TBDT (117°). At the same time, ψ is slightly larger for DR3TSBDT (74°) than for DR3TBDT (70°). This suggests that the side-chain orientations strongly depend on the anchoring atoms and it seems more difficult for PC71BM to approach the BDT surface of DR3TSBDT with respect to DR3TBDT.

Next, the mesoscopic morphologies of DR3TBDT/PC71BM and DR3TSBDT/PC71BM blends were obtained by MD simulations. The blending systems comprise 149 DR3TBDT or 146 DR3TSBDT and 200 PC71BM, consistent with the weight ratio of 1:0.8 between the donor and fullerene in experiments.30,31 The distributions of θ and ψ estimated from the MD simulations are shown in Fig. 2b. The θ distribution is centered at 121° for DR3TBDT and 104° for DR3TSBDT, in good agreement with the DFT optimization. In addition, a wide broadening of ca. 20° is found for both DR3TBDT and DR3TSBDT due to thermal dynamic motion and intermolecular interaction. For both DR3TBDT and DR3TSBDT, the distribution of ψ is low and almost unchanged from 0° to 30°, then starts to increase and reaches a maximum at ca. 75°, and finally exhibits a slight decrease from 75° to 90°. As expected, compared with DR3TBDT, DR3TSBDT shows relatively higher probability in the range of 60°–90° and lower probability in the range of 0°–60°. In particular, there is almost no distribution from 0° to 30° for DR3TSBDT. Once again, the MD simulations demonstrate the importance of anchoring atoms in tuning the orientations of side chains, which will influence the donor/fullerene interfacial arrangements.
Representative snapshots of the blend morphologies are displayed in Fig. 3a. It is observed that although the donors and fullerenes are well intermixed, there still exist lots of PC71BM aggregates with different sizes in both blending systems. Several studies identified the fullerene aggregations in the active layer as one of the key driving forces for efficient charge separation.61–64 Here, we focus on the local donor/fullerene interface geometries, which play an important role in the intermolecular CT processes. To deeply understand and build the structure–property relationship, it is highly desirable to discern which moiety of the donor (BDT, T1, T2, T3, or RD, as illustrated in Fig. 1) is close to PC71BM and the relative orientation (face-on, edge-on, or slipped) of the donor/fullerene complexes. The details on how to count the different orientations can be seen in Fig. S5.†
 Fig. 3  (a) Representative snapshots of molecular packing morphologies and (b) center-of-mass radial distribution functions of C70 relative to BDT averaged over 5 independently simulated samples for the DR3TBDT/PC71BM and DR3TSBDT/PC71BM blends and typical face-on and edge-on orientations (the inherent hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity). 
The center-of-mass (COM) radial distribution functions (RDFs) of the PC71BM carbon cage (C70) relative to each moiety of the donors were carefully examined from 5 independently simulated samples. Fig. S6† shows the COM RDFs of C60 relative to BDT for each sample. Although the individual RDFs are different from each other, the overall trends and the relative tendency between the two blend systems are hardly changed, demonstrating that the distribution of donor/acceptor orientations is independent of the batches of simulated samples. The averaged COM RDFs of C70 relative to BDT are displayed in Fig. 3b. Considering the typical π–π stacking distance of ca. 0.35 nm and the C70 radius of ca. 0.35–0.4 nm, the first RDF peaks at ca. 0.72 nm correspond to face-on orientations (type I in Fig. 3b). With respect to the DR3TSBDT/PC71BM blend, the much stronger peak indicates a relatively larger number of face-on configurations in the DR3TBDT/PC71BM blend. That is, the BDT moiety with alkyloxy side chains is more accessible for PC71BM. By contrast, owing to the bigger steric hindrance, the alkylthio side chains would make PC71BM to remain farther from BDT. This is confirmed by a distinct RDF peak at ca. 0.97 nm, corresponding to edge-on orientations (type II in Fig. 3b) for the DR3TSBDT/PC71BM blend. Stemming from the domino effect of replacement of the anchoring atoms, the RDFs of C70 relative to the other units (i.e. thiophenes and RD) are changed accordingly from the DR3TBDT/PC71BM blend to the DR3TSBDT/PC71BM blend, despite the same side groups on these units for the two small-molecule donors (Fig. S7 and S8†).
Here, in order to elucidate the influence of solvents on the local interface morphology, we also simulated the solution processing of blend films by non-equilibrium MD simulations. The COM RDFs of C70 relative to BDT for the blends by this method are shown in Fig. S9.† With respect to the DR3TSBDT/PC71BM blend, the stronger and broader peak in the range of 0.65–0.80 nm indicates a relatively larger number of BDT–PC71BM face-on configurations in the DR3TBDT/PC71BM blend. This is very consistent with the result shown in Fig. 3b, demonstrating a minor role of the solvents in determining the local interface morphologies. It should be mentioned that the sizes of the blends obtained by this method are relatively small due to the inclusion of solvent molecules and the limitation of computational costs. Thus, further analyses will be based on one of the samples obtained by the gas phase simulations.
In accord with the RDF results, from the DR3TBDT/PC71BM blend to the DR3TSBDT/PC71BM blend, the estimated probability is substantially reduced (18.53% → 10.98%) for face-on orientations, while only moderately increased (4.74% → 7.41%) for edge-on or slipped orientations in the case of PC71BM docking with BDT (Fig. 4a and Table S1†). Consequently, a relatively higher probability is found for DR3TSBDT than DR3TBDT when PC71BM docks in any type of orientation with the T1 and T2 moieties which are close to BDT. However, the situation is inversed for PC71BM docking with T3 that is farther from BDT. Since RD is too far away from BDT, the probability of PC71BM docking with RD is nearly unaffected between the two blends irrespective of orientations. Furthermore, the alkyl chain on RD is linear and very short and RD is the molecular terminal group, therefore PC71BM has a high probability to dock with RD. Notably, for both blending systems, the number of face-on configurations is significantly more than that for edge-on or slipped configurations when PC71BM docks with all the moieties but T2 of the donors. With respect to the DR3TSBDT/PC71BM blend, the overall distribution probability of face-on orientations is higher for the DR3TBDT/PC71BM blend (Fig. S10†).

Finally, on the basis of the DR3TBDT/PC71BM and DR3TSBDT/PC71BM complexes extracted from the MD simulations, we have examined the impact of interfacial molecular arrangements on exciton-dissociation and charge-recombination processes in terms of electronic couplings and binding energies of the lowest CT state. Fig. 4b and Table S2† show the average binding energies of the lowest CT state (Eb) as a function of intermolecular arrangements. It is known that a small Eb is beneficial for separation of the CT state to create free charges. As expected, for both DR3TBDT/PC71BM and DR3TSBDT/PC71BM blends, the average Eb is slightly stronger for face-on orientations relative to the other edge-on or slipped orientations, and the largest difference between the two types of orientations (ca. 0.06 eV) is found for PC71BM docking with BDT. When PC71BM moves from the terminal RD to the central BDT through the bridging thiophenes, Eb is gradually strengthened, more apparently for the DR3TBDT/PC71BM blend. In the case of face-on orientations, the average Eb for the DR3TBDT/PC71BM blend is weaker (−0.25 vs. −0.26 eV) when PC71BM docks with RD, but becomes stronger (−0.40 vs. −0.38 eV) when PC71BM approaches BDT with respect to the DR3TSBDT/PC71BM blend.
The average electronic couplings for exciton dissociation and charge recombination processes (VED and VCR) are displayed in Fig. 4c, d and Tables S3, S4.† Obviously, both VED and VCR are much stronger for face-on orientations than for the other orientations. Considering that most of the donor/fullerene interfacial configurations in both the blends adopt face-on orientations, the role of edge-on or slipped orientations can be negligible in the interfacial ED and CR processes. We then focus on the results of face-on orientations. Interestingly, no matter which moiety of the donor is close to PC71BM, VED can always maintain a considerable value (7.5–14.7 meV), ensuring efficient ED for both blends. Relatively, VCR is more dependent on intermolecular positions. When PC71BM moves from BDT to RD, VCR decreases substantially from ca. 16.5 to 4.8 meV for the DR3TSBDT/PC71BM complexes and even more pronouncedly, from ca. 19.6 to 3.5 meV for the DR3TBDT/PC71BM complexes. This can be owing to that the donor HOMO (managing the hole of the lowest interfacial CT state) is mainly distributed on the BDT and its adjacent thiophene moieties, especially for DR3TBDT (Fig. S11†).
Here, we note that for the complexes where PC71BM docks with RD, the weak VCR and Eb can lead to efficient charge separation. Owing to the large proportion of this type of complexes in both the blending systems, the OSCs with either DR3TBDT or DR3TSBDT as the donor can show a high PCE. On the other hand, docking of PC71BM with BDT brings out strong VCR and Eb, especially for the DR3TBDT/PC71BM complexes. As pointed out above, relative to the DR3TBDT/PC71BM blend, the probability of PC71BM docking with BDT is substantially reduced in the DR3TSBDT/PC71BM blend. Consequently, the OSCs based on DR3TSBDT are less affected by CR processes than the DR3TBDT-based devices, which is beneficial for improving JSC and FF to achieve a higher PCE, as observed in experiments.
Conclusions
In summary, taking DR3TBDT and DR3TSBDT as representatives, we have examined the influence of side chains with different anchoring atoms on the donor/fullerene interfacial arrangements and charge-transfer processes by means of atomistic MD simulations and electronic-structure calculations. Our results point to that such subtle chemical modification can lead to considerable changes in the distribution of fullerenes around the donor's different units, especially around the backbone core of the donors. Since these changes arise from the different orientations of side chains relative to the donor backbone that fully depend on the bonding nature of the anchoring atoms, the impact of anchoring atoms on the donor/fullerene intermolecular positions is expected to be intrinsic and universal. In addition, charge recombination at the donor/fullerene interface is demonstrated to be the most severe for the complexes where fullerene approaches the backbone core of the donors. Thus effective suppression of charge recombination can be achieved by choosing an anchoring atom showing big steric hindrance. For the first time, our work reveals the importance of side-chain anchoring atoms in tuning donor/fullerene interfacial arrangements and charge-transfer processes and will be helpful for rational design of small-molecule donors toward high-performance organic solar cells.
