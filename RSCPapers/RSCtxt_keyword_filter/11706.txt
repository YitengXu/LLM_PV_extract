    , Accepted 20th April 2017First published on 2nd May 2017AbstractA series of semi-crystalline, wide band gap (WBG) photovoltaic polymers were synthesized with varying number and topology of fluorine substituents. To decrease intramolecular charge transfer and to modulate the resulting band gap of D–A type copolymers, electron-releasing alkoxy substituents were attached to electron-deficient benzothiadiazole (A) and electron-withdrawing fluorine atoms (0–4F) were substituted onto a 1,4-bis(thiophen-2-yl)benzene unit (D). Intra- and/or interchain noncovalent Coulombic interactions were also incorporated into the polymer backbone to promote planarity and crystalline intermolecular packing. The resulting optical band gap and the valence level were tuned to 1.93–2.15 eV and −5.37 to −5.67 eV, respectively, and strong interchain organization was observed by differential scanning calorimetry, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and grazing incidence X-ray scattering measurements. The number of fluorine atoms and their position significantly influenced the photophysical, morphological and optoelectronic properties of bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) with these polymers. BHJ photovoltaic devices showed a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 9.8% with an open-circuit voltage of 0.94–1.03 V. To our knowledge, this PCE is one of the highest values for fullerene-based single BHJ devices with WBG polymers having a band gap of over 1.90 eV. A tandem solar cell was also demonstrated successfully to show a PCE of 10.3% by combining a diketopyrrolopyrrole-based low band gap polymer.

Broader context
Renewable and eco-friendly energy sources such as photovoltaic cell technologies have been tremendously improved and extensively implemented in order to replace environmentally harmful energy sources over the past several decades. In particular, polymer solar cells (PSC) have attracted increasing attention because of their many advantages such as mechanical flexibility, solution processability and low cost, which make them an attractive technology to satisfy future energy demands. As a result of a collective worldwide endeavor to develop PSCs, device efficiency has improved considerably over a short period of time. Despite significant improvements in device efficiency, current power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have not yet been sufficient for their widespread commercialization. To solve this challenge, multi-junction bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs are considered a promising route for further improvement of device performance, by utilizing optimal combinations of both wide and small band gap polymers. In this work, we report a new series of semi-crystalline conjugated polymers with wide band gaps of over 1.90 eV, which demonstrate a high PCE of 9.8% in single-junction BHJ devices as well as a PCE of 10.3% in tandem devices. We believe that our results provide an effective pathway to realize the commercial application of PSCs.

1. Introduction
Over the last several decades, organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention as a portable and flexible energy source because of their light weight, mechanical flexibility and potential for low cost solution fabrication onto a large-area flexible plastic substrate.1–4 Over the past few years, structural optimization of photovoltaic polymers (or small molecules) and device architecture, morphological control using processing additives and/or thermal (or solvent) annealing, as well as interlayer engineering, have led to power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of over 10% in single and multi-junction PSCs.5–11 The design strategy of donor–acceptor (D–A) type alternating copolymers using intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) interactions is an effective way to tune the band gap of photovoltaic materials in PSCs. According to the optical band gap, photovoltaic polymers can be classified into low band gap (LBG, Eg < 1.6 eV), mid band gap (MBG, 1.6 < Eg < 1.8 eV) and wide band gap (WBG, Eg > 1.8 eV) polymers.12–20 Because the optical absorption of a single polymer is relatively narrow with respect to the solar spectrum, tandem or ternary blend solar cells have been often tried as an alternative method to cover a broader spectral range by combination of polymers with complementary optical absorption.21–25 It has been predicted that the ultimately achievable PCE of a tandem PSC with two absorbing layers is 15–20%.26,27 To achieve such a high PCE in tandem PSCs, it is essential to have both highly efficient WBG and LBG-polymers with a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and complementary optical absorption.26,27 Various types of MBG and/or LBG polymers have been reported, but relatively fewer WBG polymer have been examined in BHJs.28,29
Development of new WBG conjugated polymers with excellent photovoltaic properties is important for efficient tandem or ternary PSCs. In the most efficient tandem cells reported previously, poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) is a common WBG polymer. However, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of BHJs with P3HT can be limited by its high-lying HOMO level.22 Hou et al. recently pushed forward the highest PCE of tandem (11.6%) and ternary (12.2%) organic solar cells by utilizing a deep HOMO, WBG polymer instead of P3HT along with complementary LBG polymer/small molecules with broad absorption spectra; this work demonstrated the importance of using high-efficiency, deep-HOMO WBG polymers in tandem and ternary solar cells.30 However, very few high-efficiency, deep-HOMO WBG polymers have been currently reported. To design new WBG polymers with a deep HOMO level, it is necessary to finely control the ICT interaction in the D–A copolymer structures while still allowing the morphology of BHJs to provide good charge mobility and charge generation to achieve high PCE. It is quite challenging to design an ordered WBG polymer with a deep HOMO that has a planar polymeric backbone. Although increasing the torsional angle between units in the polymer main chain can increase the band gap, the interchain organization can become significantly disturbed and this can disrupt the morphology.
There have been several successful reports on WBG photovoltaic polymers (see Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI†). Beaujuge et al. and co-workers designed poly(4,8-bis((2-ethylhexyl)oxy)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-3,4-difluorothiophene) (PBDT2FT) as an alternative WBG polymer to P3HT based on 3,4-difluorothiophene motifs to extend the optical gap (2.1 eV) and achieved 7% PCE in BHJs.31 Hou et al. developed a new WBG polymer, PM6, by fluorination of a donor segment in the D–A alternating structure and achieved over 9% PCE.32 Wang et al. also developed an alternative copolymer, PBDTTS-FTAZ, with a band gap of 1.9 eV by using fluorinated benzotriazole and alkylthio side-chains, showing a PCE of over 8%.33 Jo and coworkers investigated the fluorination (on the D unit) effect in D–A polymers and obtained ∼7% PCE.34 Recently, Sun et al. reported a highly efficient WBG polymer (1.9 eV band gap) with the highest PCE of 9.8% reported so far by extending π-conjugation of the benzodithiophene unit of the poly[dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-1,3-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-benzo-[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione] (PDBT-T1) polymer.35
Inspired by the previous reports, we designed new WBG polymers based on our previous design concept using intra- and/or interchain noncovalent Coulombic interactions.31–40 In this contribution, we have designed and synthesized a series of semi-crystalline WBG D–A type conjugated copolymers with fluorine substitution of varying number and position, based on a similar backbone of the previously reported poly[(2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)phenylene)-alt-(5,6-difluoro-4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole)] (PPDT2FBT).39 The band gap was finely tuned by the ICT interaction from the weak donor–weak acceptor design motif. To decrease the electron-deficiency of difluorobenzothiadiazole (2FBT) in PPDT2FBT, the fluorine substituents were replaced with the electron-releasing dialkoxy groups. In addition, the phenylene ring was substituted with varying number and position of fluorine atoms, which decreases the electron sufficiency of the 1,4-bis(thiophen-2-yl)phenylene moiety, resulting in a decreased ICT interaction along the polymeric backbone. The optical gap was successfully adjusted to 1.93–2.15 eV and remarkable photovoltaic PCE of up to 9.8% was measured with a high VOC of ∼1 V. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 9.8% is one of the highest values reported so far for fullerene-based single-junction BHJ PSCs using polymers with an optical band gap of above 1.9 eV. The crystalline blend morphology with nanofibrillar structure formation and face-on orientation explains well-balanced charge carrier transport and the resulting photovoltaic characteristics. By combining a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based LBG polymer, DT-PDPP2T-TT, a tandem cell was also fabricated, showing the great potential (10.3% PCE) of the WBG polymers as a front subcell component.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Molecular design, synthesis and characterization
Synthetic routes to the dialkoxybenzothiadiazole (DOBT) monomer and final polymers are described in Scheme 1. DOBT is substituted with two 2-hexyldecyloxy side-chains for solution processability where the electron-releasing alkoxy group decreases the electron-withdrawing ability of DOBT and the resulting ICT interaction, modulating the band gap of resulting polymers. Additionally, the intrachain dipole–dipole interaction via Sδ+⋯Oδ− in the neighboring thiophene and DOBT moieties enhances the chain planarity and interchain orderings. The substitution of solubilizing alkoxy side-chains on the electron-deficient BT negligibly increases the HOMO level. As shown in Scheme 1, the DOBT monomer was prepared by two steps using 5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole (10) as a starting material. First, 5,6-difluorobenzothiadiazole was reacted with 2-hexyldecanol in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) to form 5,6-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)benzothiadiazole (11) almost quantitatively, and then the monomer M21 was obtained in ∼80% yield by bromination of 11 with bromine in a mixture of dichloromethane:acetic acid (2:1 by volume). Five different kinds of dithienylbenzene intermediates (31–35) with different numbers and positions of fluorine atoms were prepared by Stille coupling (yield: 50–80%) of dibromobenzene compounds (with/without fluorines) and 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene. The dialkoxy substituents on BT decrease the electron deficiency of BT, resulting in decreased ICT along the polymeric backbone. Similarly, the different number of fluorine substituents with different topology (syn or anti) modulates the ICT interaction along the polymer backbone and influences the interchain dipole–dipole interactions and intermolecular ordering. The weak donor–weak acceptor design strategy decreases the ICT and increases the band gap (∼2 eV), compared to the parent PPDT2FBT (band gap 1.76 eV) structure. Successive stannylation with n-butyllithium and trimethyltin chloride yielded the final M41–M45 monomers in 70–80% yield. The synthetic details are described in the ESI†. The resulting WBG copolymers were synthesized via the Stille coupling of brominated monomer M21 and five corresponding tin monomers (M41–M45) using Pd2dba3/P(o-tolyl)3 as a catalytic system in a microwave reactor, yielding poly[(5,6-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4,7-diyl)-alt-(5,5′-(1,4-phenylene)bis(thiophen-2-yl))] (PDTBTBz-0F) (yield: 78%), poly[(5,6-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4,7-diyl)-alt-(5,5′-(2-fluoro-1,4-phenylene)bis(thiophen-2-yl))] (PDTBTBz-1F) (77%), poly[(5,6-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4,7-diyl)-alt-(5,5′-(2,3-difluoro-1,4-phenylene)bis(thiophen-2-yl))] (PDTBTBz-2Fsyn) (77%), poly[(5,6-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4,7-diyl)-alt-(5,5′-(2,5-difluoro-1,4-phenylene)bis(thiophen-2-yl))] (PDTBTBz-2Fanti) (81%) and poly[(5,6-bis(2-hexyldecyloxy)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4,7-diyl)-alt-(5,5′-(2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-1,4-phenylene)bis(thiophen-2-yl))] (PDTBTBz-4F) (78%). All the polymers showed sufficient solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene, etc. (Scheme 2).

 Scheme 2  Molecular structures of polymers in this study and PPDT2FBT.39 
The molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymers were characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using o-dichlorobenzene as the eluent relative to polystyrene as a standard at 80 °C. Each polymerization was carried out three times and the three batches under the same conditions showed similar molecular weights and PDI values. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of this polymer series were measured to be in the range of 26–48 kDa (see Table 1). The thermal stability of the polymers was tested by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere, showing decomposition temperatures (with 5% weight loss) of ∼280 °C (see Fig. S2, ESI†). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements show clear endothermic peaks at 243.3, 251.1, 253.0, 274.6, and 284.7 °C for PDTBTBz-0F, PDTBTBz-1F, PDTBTBz-2Fsyn, PDTBTBz-2Fanti, and PDTBTBz-4F, respectively, which correspond to the melting temperatures of each polymer (see Fig. S3, ESI†). The DSC data strongly support the crystalline nature of polymers, which may originate from strong interchain ordering via intra- and/or interchain noncovalent Coulombic attractions (dipole–dipole and hydrogen bonding interaction). The melting point increases with increasing number of fluorine atoms, suggesting stronger intermolecular interaction with fluorine substitution. In addition, the different symmetry in the fluorine substitution for PDTBTBz-2Fanti (C2-symmetric) and PDTBTBz-2Fsyn (mirror-symmetric) may influence interchain organization in the solid state. According to the DSC data, PDTBTBz-2Fanti with C2-symmetric F substitution is expected to improve the crystalline interchain ordering with a close and tight packing.12

2.2 Structural analysis by density functional theory and electrochemical properties
The minimum energy conformation, torsional energy barriers between units, and the frontier orbital structures of five polymers were calculated by density functional theory (DFT; Jaguar quantum chemistry software, B3LYP/6-31G** level of theory). For simplicity, methyl substituents (in place of hexyldecyl groups) were considered for all structures.37 The torsional angles between the constituting building blocks along the polymeric chain based on a model with two repeat units are summarized in Table S2, ESI.† Upon addition of fluorine atoms to a benzene ring, the torsional angles (θ2, θ3, θ6 and θ7) between thiophene and benzene moieties were clearly decreased through the dipole–dipole induced interaction such as Sδ+⋯Fδ− and Fδ−⋯Hδ+, inducing a more planar polymeric backbone (see dihedral angle: 20 degree for PDTBTBz-0F and 0 degree for PDTBTBz-4F). This planarity of the chain is beneficial for achieving more ordered interchain packing and hence affects the resulting morphology in BHJ films and their photovoltaic properties. Interestingly, the PDTBTBz-2Fsyn and PDTBTBz-2Fanti polymers show clearly different minimum energy conformations where PDTBTBz-2Fanti shows a more planar structure compared to PDTBTBz-2Fsyn. In addition, the electronic structures of HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) frontier orbitals were similar for all polymers but their energy levels were gradually down-shifted upon substituting more fluorine atoms due to their strong electron-withdrawing effect (see Table S4, ESI†).
2.3 Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform and in thin films are shown in Fig. 1 and summarized in Table 1. The polymers show two absorption bands in which the first absorption peak below 450 nm is attributed to the characteristic π–π* transition and the low-energy absorption band in the range of 450–650 nm is attributed to the ICT interaction. Compared to the similarly structured PPDT2FBT reported previously (based on 2FBT and dialkoxy-substituted dithienylbenzene, optical band gap of 1.76 eV),39 the newly synthesized PDTBTBz series polymers show a blue-shifted absorption due to the decreased ICT from dithienylbenzene (with or without fluorine) to DOBT.41 The polymers show wide optical band gaps of 1.9–2.0 eV, depending on the number and topology of fluorine substitution. Except for PDTBTBz-0F, all fluorine-substituted polymers show a vibronic shoulder peak in solution, suggesting strong interchain interactions. In chloroform, the absorption maximum was observed at λabs = 508, 523, 558, 563 and 546 nm for PDTBTBz-0F, PDTBTBz-1F, PDTBTBz-2Fsyn, PDTBTBz-2Fanti, and PDTBTBz-4F, respectively. With increasing number of fluorine substituents, λabs was measured to be red-shifted except for PDTBTBz-4F. In films, the absorption spectra of PDTBTBz-0F and PDTBTBz-1F were further red-shifted with λabs = 569 and 571 nm. In contrast, PDTBTBz-2Fsyn, PDTBTBz-2Fanti, and PDTBTBz-4F show similar λabs's in solution and in films, which may be due to the strong self-aggregation of these polymers even in solution with increasing fluorine substitution. It is noteworthy to mention that PDTBTBz-2Fanti and PDTBTBz-4F show the most pronounced vibronic shoulder peak in films, suggesting the strongest interchain π–π stacking than other polymers.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was utilized to investigate the electrochemical properties and electronic energy levels of the polymers (see Fig. S5, ESI†). The HOMO energy levels of the polymers were determined from the oxidation onsets, by assuming that the energy level of ferrocene (Fc) is −4.8 eV relative to the vacuum level. In the anodic scan, the onsets of oxidation for PDTBTBz-0F, PDTBTBz-1F, PDTBTBz-2Fsyn, PDTBTBz-2Fanti, and PDTBTBz-4F were measured at 0.57, 0.58, 0.62, 0.70, and 0.87 V, corresponding to the ionization potential values of −5.37, −5.38, −5.42, −5.50, and −5.67 eV, respectively. The LUMO energy levels were estimated similarly from the reduction onsets. In the cathodic scan, the onsets of reduction (versus Fc+/Fc) for PDTBTBz-0F, PDTBTBz-1F, PDTBTBz-2Fsyn, PDTBTBz-2Fanti, and PDTBTBz-4F occur at −1.40, −1.35, −1.36, −1.31, and −1.28 V, corresponding to the LUMO levels of −3.40, −3.45, −3.44, −3.49, and −3.52 eV, respectively. The results are summarized in Table 1 and the energy band diagram is sketched in Fig. 1d. It indicates that both HOMO and LUMO of polymers become deeper with increasing F substituents onto the polymer backbone, being consistent with the DFT calculation. A comparison of PDTBTBz-2Fsyn and PDTBTBz-2Fanti reveals that the substitution of two F atoms at the anti positions leads to a deeper HOMO energy level than that for the syn isomer. The HOMO energy levels of PDTBTBz polymers are clearly down-shifted (up to −5.67 eV) and the LUMO levels are up-shifted (up to −3.40 eV) based on the weaker donor and acceptor pairs, resulting in a wider band gap, compared to PPDT2FBT (HOMO: −5.45 eV, LUMO: −3.69 eV).39
2.4 Photovoltaic characteristics
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of PDTBTBz-based polymers, PSC devices using a BHJ blend of PDTBTBz-based polymers as the electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the acceptor were fabricated in a conventional device structure of indium-tin-oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/polymers:PC71BM/Ca/Al (see Fig. 1c). First, the device fabrication was optimized at a polymer:PC71BM blend ratio of 1:1.5 (by weight) using chlorobenzene as a main solvent without any processing additives. The photovoltaic characteristics were tested under the illumination condition of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2). Fig. S6a and b (ESI†) show the optimal current density and voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra, respectively. As summarized in Table S4 (ESI†), the device with PDTBTBz-2Fanti showed the highest PCE of 5.4% with JSC of 10.6 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.93, and fill factor (FF) of 0.55. The use of processing additives can modify the BHJ morphology, resulting in the improvement of device properties in many cases.42,43 We therefore further tested devices with diphenyl ether (DPE) as a processing additive.39,44 The devices processed with the solvent mixture of CB and DPE (97:3 vol%) led to a remarkable increase in all device parameters compared to devices without DPE as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S6 (ESI†). In addition, we investigated the use of other processing additives such as 1,8-diiodooctane and 1-chloronaphthalene with PDTBTBz-2Fanti:PC71BM blends (morphologies are reported in Fig. S7, ESI†). These results confirmed that DPE was the most effective processing additive. PDTBTBz-2Fanti:PC71BM blends processed with DPE exhibited the best performance among all of our WBG polymer blends as shown in Fig. S8 and Table S5 (ESI†). In particular, PCEs of the devices with incorporation of DPE significantly increased from 2.2, 2.6, 5.2, 5.4, and 2.5% to 7.3, 7.5, 8.1, 9.8, and 4.1% for PDTBTBz-0F, -1F, -2Fsyn, -2Fanti and -4F based PSCs, respectively. The detailed device parameters are listed in Table 2. Remarkably high values of VOC (over 0.9 V) and good values of FF (0.6–0.7) were obtained for all devices. The optimized thicknesses of active layers with DPE additive were determined to be 160 nm (PDTBTBz-0F), 145 nm (PDTBTBz-1F), 150 nm (PDTBTBz-2Fsyn), 190 nm (PDTBTBz-2Fanti) and 150 nm (PDTBTBz-4F).

Among five PDTBTBz-based PSC devices processed with CB:DPE, the device using the PDTBTBz-2Fanti:PC71BM blend showed the best PCE of 9.8% with JSC of 14.0 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.97 V and FF of 0.72. JSC (14.0 mA cm−2) measured from the device with the PDTBTBz-2Fanti:PC71BM blend is well matched with the calculated JSC (13.8 mA cm−2) from EQE as shown in Fig. 2b and Table 2. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 9.8% is one of the highest values yet reported for fullerene-based single BHJ PSCs using polymers with band gaps over 1.90 eV. Interestingly, difluorinated PDTBTBz-2Fanti and PDTBTBz-2Fsyn showed higher photovoltaic performance, compared with PDTBTBz-0F, -1F and 4F. Furthermore, the anti-substitution of two F atoms turned out to be more beneficial for improving the photovoltaic properties. Compared to PPDT2FBT, PDTBTBz-2Fanti shows a lower JSC value (16.3 → 14.0 mA cm−2) due to the narrower absorption range but higher VOC (0.79 → 0.97 V) with deeper HOMO. Both polymers show similarly high FF, showing well distributed nano-fibrillar, semi-crystalline BHJ film morphology.39
2.5 Characterization of film morphology

Fig. 3 shows the AFM topography images of the polymer:PC71BM blend films prepared from CB and CB:DPE solvents. The BHJ film of PDTBTBz-0F prepared from CB solvent shows a very smooth surface with a root-mean-square (rms) roughness of 0.58. With increasing F substitution, the surface roughens with rms values increasing to 1.04, 1.55, 1.83 and 2.43 nm for DTBTBz-1F, -2Fsyn, -2Fanti and 4F blend films, respectively. This roughness may be related to the strong interchain interaction and self-agglomeration. In contrast, the optimal BHJ films prepared from a CB:DPE solvent mixture show significantly different nanoscale morphologies. Among the blend films, the PDTBTBz-2Fanti:PC71BM blend are the smoothest (rms roughness of 1.58 nm) and finely dispersed surface topology (see Fig. 3i).

Without DPE: (a) PDTBTBz-0F, (b) PDTBTBz-1F, (c) PDTBTBz-2Fsyn, (d) PDTBTBz-2Fanti, and (e) PDTBTBz-4F. With DPE: (f) PDTBTBz-0F, (g) PDTBTBz-1F, (h) PDTBTBz-2Fsyn, (i) PDTBTBz-2Fanti, and (j) PDTBTBz-4F. The size of all images is 3.0 μm × 3.0 μm. 
To further study the BHJ film morphology of PDTBTBz-2Fsyn and PDTBTBz-2Fanti blend films, HR-TEM images were also measured as shown in Fig. 4. Both PDTBTBz-2Fsyn and PDTBTBz-2Fanti blend films show fibril-like structures and more finely distributed and clear fibrillar structures were observed with addition of DPE (Fig. 4c and d). A similar blend morphology of PPDT2FBT was reported previously,39 which is closely related to the semi-crystalline nature of polymer via intra- and/or interchain noncovalent Coulombic interactions. The nanofibrillar crystalline morphology can allow efficient charge transport, increasing the JSC and FF values of PSCs.36,45 The TEM image of the PDTBTBz-2Fanti blend film (processed with DPE) showed more developed fibrillary structures compared to the PDTBTBz-2Fsyn blend, leading to better device performance of PDTBTBz-2Fanti:PC71BM. The morphology of the PDTBTBz-2Fanti blend film, obtained from AFM and HR-TEM measurements, helps in providing the high photovoltaic efficiency compared to all polymers examined.
 Fig. 4  HR-TEM images of PDTBTBz-2Fsyn and -2Fanti polymers:PC71BM films without (a and b) and with DPE (c and d), respectively. The size of all images is 1.8 μm × 1.8 μm. 
To further investigate the detailed film morphologies of five PDTBTBz-based polymers, the molecular orientation and packing characteristics were studied by 2D-GIWAXS.46–48Fig. 5 and Fig. S9 (ESI†) show the 2D-GIWAXS images and in-plane and out-of-plane line-cut profiles of pristine polymers, polymer:PC71BM blend films with and without DPE. The extracted 2D-GIWAXS scattering features are summarized in Table S6 (ESI†). With regard to pristine films, the scattering from PDTBTBz-0F is characteristic of a glassy film, but increasing order is observed for polymers with F substituents. PDTBTBz-2Fanti shows well-resolved lamellar scattering up to (300) in the out-of-plane direction with π–π stacking (010) peaks in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. The lamellar d-spacing for the PDTBTBz-1F, -2Fsyn, -2Fanti, and -4F neat films were measured to be ∼18 to 21 Å. The π–π stacking distances were ∼3.7Å for all samples.

(a) 2D-GIWAXS images of pristine polymer films, (b) polymers:PC71BM blend films, and (c) polymers:PC71BM blend films with DPE. Each panel from left to right shows the 2D-GIWAXS images for PDTBTBz-0F, PDTBTBz-1F, PDTBTBz-2Fsyn, PDTBTBz-2Fanti, and PDTBTBz-4F, respectively. Note that images have not been corrected for the inaccessible region of reciprocal space near the qz axis. 
In the case of BHJs of the polymers with PC71BM, there were no large changes in the packing structure of the polymer, but there were changes in texture of the crystallites. The π–π stacking (010) peak appears mainly in the out-of-plane direction, suggesting preferential face-on orientation in the blends (see PDTBTBz-2Fsyn, PDTBTBz-2Fanti and PDTBTBz-4F blend films). The polymer phase in PDTBTBz-0F:PC71BM and PDTBTBz-1F:PC71BM BHJs is disordered, and no clear alkyl or π–π stacking (010) peak is assignable. Aggregates of PC71BM are observed in all BHJs by a characteristic glassy peak around 1.33–1.37 Å−1 similar to observations for BHJs of PCPDTBT/PC71BM and other systems.49,50 Upon addition of a processing additive, DPE, similar scattering patterns with qualitatively stronger intensity were observed. The PDTBTBz-2Fanti:PC71BM and PDTBTBz-2Fsyn:PC71BM blends show the most pronounced lamellar and π–π stacking scatterings. Interestingly, the PDTBTBz-4F:PC71BM blend also showed a strong and similar 2D-GIWAXS pattern to the difluoro-polymers, but the lowest photovoltaic performance was observed.
The phase separated domain structure is closely correlated with charge separation and extraction in BHJ polymer:fullerene solar cell systems.47,51,52 In-plane periodicities for five PDTBTBz-based BHJ blend thin films were probed using resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS).47,51,52 The five blend samples were prepared using the same film fabrication conditions used to prepare optimized solar cell devices. RSoXS data were obtained at a photon energy of 286.4 eV, which exhibited high scattering contrast. Fig. S10 (ESI†) shows Lorentz corrected RSoXS profiles as a function of scattering vector q. A single dominant peak located in the range of q = 0.010–0.017 Å−1 was observed for all five samples, corresponding to length scales of approximately 43, 51, 44, 38, and 60 nm for PDTBTBz-0F, PDTBTBz-1F, PDTBTBz-2Fsyn, PDTBTBz-2Fanti and PDTBTBz-4F containing BHJ blend films, respectively. This length scale likely corresponds to an average domain separation distance. The PDTBTBz-2Fanti:PC71BM blend exhibits the smallest domain separation and the highest PCE in solar cell devices, suggesting that it forms a phase separated morphology with more favorable length scales for charge separation and transport relative to the other BHJ blends. Compared to PDTBTBz-2F polymers, PDTBTBz-4F has the most rigid structure with 4 fluorine atoms in the polymeric backbone and shows the strongest tendency of interchain aggregation with relatively poor solubility. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the PDTBTBz-4F:PC71BM blend exhibits a larger average domain size. The quick and excessive segregation of PDTBTBz-4F may decrease the domain purity (Fig. S10, ESI†) in the blend with PC71BM, resulting in poorer photovoltaic performance.
2.6 Charge carrier transport and recombination
To study the charge transport and recombination behaviors in the PDTBTBz-based PSCs, the light intensity dependence of JSC was measured under short-circuit conditions.53–55Fig. 2c exhibits logarithmic plots of JSCs as a function of the light intensity, showing the power-law dependence of JSC ∝ Pα (where P is the incident-light intensity and α is an exponential constant, generally 0.85–1 in PSCs).55 The α values were determined to be 0.90, 0.91, 0.94, 0.94 and 0.92 for the PDTBTBz-0F, -1F, -2Fanti, -2Fsyn and -4F BHJ devices with PC71BM (with DPE), respectively. The devices of PDTBTBz-2Fsyn and -2Fanti showed a relatively higher value (α = 0.94) compared to other devices. The higher α value for the PDTBTBz-2Fanti and -2Fsyn devices suggests a weaker bimolecular recombination during the charge transport process,55 showing good agreement with the measured photovoltaic characteristics for both devices (see Table 2).
The charge carrier transport in both horizontal and vertical directions was investigated by fabrication of polymer field-effect transistors (PFETs) and the SCLC method. The details of PFET fabrication are described in the Experimental section (channel length L = 20 μm, channel width W = 1000 μm). Transfer and output characteristics of the PFETs of five PDTBTBz-based polymers are shown in Fig. S11 and S12 (ESI†), respectively. As summarized in Table S7 (ESI†), the hole mobilities were determined to be 2.4 × 10−2, 4.1 × 10−2, 5.2 × 10−2, 5.6 × 10−2 and 9.0 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, for the PDTBTBz-0F, -1F, -2Fsyn, -2Fanti and -4F pristine polymer films, respectively. PDTBTBz-2Fanti and -2Fsyn show the highest hole mobility. To obtain the vertical mobility, hole-only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymers:PC71BM/Au) and electron-only (FTO/polymer:PC71BM/Al, FTO:fluorine-doped tin oxide) devices were prepared under the same fabrication conditions as the optimized PSC devices. Fig. S13 and Table S8 (ESI†) show the J–V characteristics and extracted mobility values of the hole- and electron-only devices, respectively. The vertical hole and electron mobilities were calculated based on the Mott–Gurney equation, JSCL = 9ε0εrμV2/(8L3) (where ε0 is the free-space permittivity, εr is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor, μ is the mobility, V is the applied voltage and L is the thickness of the active layer).56,57 The hole (μh) (and electron (μe)) mobility values obtained from the SCLC method are 1.0 × 10−3 (7.5 × 10−4), 1.07 × 10−3 (8.3 × 10−4), 1.0 × 10−3 (9.0 × 10−4), 1.15 × 10−3 (1.1 × 10−3) and 1.15× 10−4 (7.3 × 10−4) cm2 V−1 s−1, for the BHJ devices of PDTBTBz-0F, -1F, -2Fsyn, -2Fanti and -4F, respectively (see Table S8, ESI†). All the devices showed efficient vertical transport of charge carriers, showing a mobility of ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The μh/μe ratio was also calculated to be 1.33 (PDTBTBz-0F), 1.29 (PDTBTBz-1F), 1.11 (PDTBTBz-2Fsyn), 1.05 (PDTBTBz-2Fanti) and 0.16 (PDTBTBz-4F). The PDTBTBz-2Fanti:PC71BM and PDTBTBz-2Fsyn:PC71BM blends with DPE show the most balanced μh/μe ratio of 1.05–1.11, suggesting the efficient charge transport and extraction with little electron–hole recombination in the PSC device. On the contrary, the poor photovoltaic properties of the device using PDTBTBz-4F:PC71BM may be mainly due to an unbalanced charge carrier transport, build-up of space charges and the resulting electron–hole recombination.
2.7 Tandem solar cells
Based on the outstanding photovoltaic performance of a single junction PSC of PDTBTBz-2Fanti, we also fabricated a tandem PSC by combining the WBG polymer PDTBTBz-2Fanti (Eg > 1.9 eV) with a DPP-based LBG polymer, DT-PDPP2T-TT (Eg ∼ 1.4 eV).58 These two polymers have complementary absorption spectra such that the WBG front cell absorbs high energy photons and produces a large VOC, while allowing low energy red and infrared photons to pass through to the LBG back cell which produces additional current at a lower VOC. Brabec and coworkers suggested that an optimal combination of bandgaps of 1.3 eV and 1.6 eV would maximize the tandem device efficiency; however, this study did not completely account for the effects of overlapping absorption spectra.26,27 The tandem PSC was fabricated using a conventional device structure where the PDTBTBz-2Fanti:PC71BM and DT-PDPP2T-TT:PC71BM blend layers were incorporated as a front and a back cell, respectively (Fig. 6a). The DT-PDPP2T-TT LBG polymer was synthesized following the same synthetic method and the device was fabricated using the same conditions as reported in the previous literature.44,58 As shown in Fig. 6c, the PDTBTBz-2Fanti:PC71BM and DT-PDPP2T-TT:PC71BM blends show complementary absorption, covering a broad range of solar spectrum of UV-vis and near infrared regions up to 900 nm in a tandem device. The front (PDTBTBz-2Fanti:PC71BM) and back (DT-PDPP2T-TT:PC71BM) subcells showed PCEs of 9.0% and 8.0%, respectively (see Fig. 6d and Table S9, ESI†). By combining both front and back cells, the tandem PSC achieved a PCE of 10.3% along with JSC = 9.89 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.58 V, and FF = 0.66. We confirmed the great potential of tandem devices using the WBG PDTBTBz polymer and the device optimization is now under investigation by combining various LBG polymers and recombination layers and by modulating the thickness of each subcell. Detailed results on the tandem devices will be reported separately.

2.8 Inverted devices and device stability
We prepared and characterized inverted devices (Fig. S14, ESI†) using the architecture ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Au. These devices exhibited slightly reduced photovoltaic performance relative to that of conventional devices, showing a JSC of 11.3 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.97 V, FF of 0.66 and PCE of 7.3%. We investigated the air stability of inverted devices and conventional devices (conventional devices with Al or Ca/Al electrodes without sealing and Ca/A1 with UV epoxy sealant; inverted structure devices using MoO3/Au electrodes without sealing). As shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†), the performance degradation of devices with Al and Ca/Al electrodes without encapsulation is similar within 100 h of air exposure. In contrast, the devices with MoO3/Au without sealing and Ca/Al with UV epoxy sealant show much better long-term stability. The Ca/Al cathode is not stable and is unsuitable for commercialization of PSCs. However, we observed that conventional devices using Ca/Al with proper encapsulation showed similar or better stability compared to inverted devices without encapsulation. These data indicate that our WBG polymers exhibit comparably good stability in the inverted geometry or in the conventional structure with proper encapsulation.
3. Conclusion
In summary, a new series of semi-crystalline photovoltaic polymers with a wide band gap of over 1.90 eV were designed and synthesized based on a weak donor–weak acceptor motif by varying the number and position of fluorine substituents. In a design of a polymeric main chain, noncovalent Coulombic interactions (such as H bonding and dipole–dipole interactions) were considered to enhance the chain planarity and interchain ordering. By attaching the solubilizing alkoxy side chains onto the electron-deficient benzothiadiazole, the intramolecular charge transfer was modulated to decrease maintaining a deep conduction band. Five different polymers showed optical band gaps in the range of 1.93–2.15 eV and the HOMO level decreased gradually with increasing number of fluorine substituents (−5.37 to − 5.67 eV). In particular, PDTBTBz-2Fanti showed a crystalline nanofibrillar morphology with strong face-on π–π stacking in the blend film with PC71BM. The best PCE of 9.8% was obtained with PDTBTBz-2Fanti with a remarkably high VOC of 0.97 V, JSC of 13.95 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.72. A high horizontal mobility of 5.6 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 was measured by PFET fabrication and well balanced hole and electron mobilities (μh/μe = 1.15 × 10−3/1.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) in a vertical direction were also measured by the SCLC method. In addition, PDTBTBz-2Fanti showed great potential as a front subcell, showing a PCE of 10.3% in a tandem PSC device.
4. Experimental
4.1 General

1H, 13C and 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on Bruker DRX-300 FT-NMR, Bruker Avance-400 MHz, and Bruker Avance-500 MHz spectrometers at 25 °C. Me4Si and the residual solvent peak impurity are used as reference of 1H and 13C NMR spectra. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm and coupling constants in Hz as absolute values. UV-visible spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer at room temperature. All solution UV-vis experiments were carried out in CHCl3. Films were prepared by spin-coating CHCl3 solutions onto quartz substrates. Full scan, low resolution mass spectrometry was carried out at the analytical center, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology. DSC was performed using a TA Instruments DSC (Model Q-1000) with about 5 mg samples at a rate of 10 °C min−1 in the temperature range of 0 to 300 °C, unless otherwise stated. TGA was carried out at the Analytical Center, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology. Samples were run under N2 and heated from room temperature to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. All electrochemical measurements were performed using IVIUMSTAT instrument model PV-08 in a standard three-electrode, one compartment configuration equipped with Ag/AgNO3 electrode, Pt wire and Pt electrode (dia. 1.6 mm) as the pseudo reference, counter electrode and working electrode, respectively. Pt working electrodes were polished with alumina. The measurements were carried out in anhydrous acetonitrile with tetrabutyl ammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte under an argon atmosphere at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. Polymer films were prepared by drop casting onto the Pt working electrode from chloroform solution and dried before measurements. The electrochemical onsets were determined at the position where the current starts to differ from the baseline. The potential of the Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode was internally calibrated by using the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+), which has a known reduction potential of −4.8 eV. The HOMOs of copolymers were calculated from the onset oxidation potentials (Eoxonset) according to: HOMO = −(Eoxonset + 4.8) (eV). The LUMOs of copolymers were calculated from the onset reduction potentials (Eredonset) according to: LUMO = −(Eredonset + 4.8) (eV).
4.2 Film characterization
AFM images were collected using a Veeco Multimode microscope with 300 kHz silicon tips operating in tapping mode. HR-TEM images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2100 TEM operated at 200 kV. 2D-GIWAXS experiments were performed at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at beamline 7.3.3. The incident beam energy is 10 keV, and the incident angle used was 0.12–0.14°. The sample-to-detector distance was 30 cm, and a Pilatus 2M area detector was used for 2D diffraction pattern collection. Samples were kept in a helium environment during X-ray scattering to minimize background scattering and beam damage. Exposure times were 5 to 60 seconds. Samples for 2D-GIWAXS measurements were prepared by spin-coating pristine polymer and polymers:PC71BM blend solutions on top of PEDOT:PSS/Si substrates.
Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) was performed at beamline 11.0.1.2 at the Advanced Light Source. Thin film samples were prepared on 100 nm thick 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm silicon nitride membranes supported by a 5 mm × 5 mm silicon frame (Norcada Inc.). Scattering was collected in a transmission geometry with a 150 mm sample–detector distance. Data were collected on an in-vacuum CCD camera (Princeton Instrument PI-MTE) thermoelectrically cooled to −45 °C. Images were taken near the carbon K edge, in the range of 280–300 eV. 2D data were reduced by azimuthally averaging over all q values.
4.3 Fabrication and characterization of PSCs
Photovoltaic devices were fabricated according to the following procedures. First, the glass/ITO substrates were cleaned with detergent, then ultra-sonicated in acetone and isopropyl alcohol and subsequently dried in an oven overnight at 100 °C. PEDOT:PSS hole transport layers were spin-coated (after passing through a 0.45 μm cellulose acetate syringe filter) at 5000 rpm for 40 s followed by baking at 150 °C for 30 min in air and then moved into a glovebox. For the single-junction active layer, blend solutions of PDTBTBz-based polymers (1.0 wt%):PC71BM (1.5 wt%) dissolved in CB (with 1.5–3 vol% DPE) were spin-coated (1500 to 3000 rpm for optimization) on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The device was pumped down under vacuum (<10−6 Torr), and the Ca/Al (20 nm/100 nm thick) electrode for the conventional architecture was deposited on top of the active layer by thermal evaporation. The deposited Ca/Al electrode area defined the active area as 13 mm2. Photovoltaic characteristic measurements were carried out inside the glovebox using a high quality optical fiber to guide the light from the solar simulator equipped with a Keithley 2635A source measurement unit. J–V curves were measured under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 using an aperture to define the illuminated area. EQE measurements were conducted in ambient air using an EQE system (Model QEX7) by PV Measurements Inc. (Boulder, Colorado). The monochromatic light intensity was calibrated using a Si photodiode and chopped at 100 Hz. A mask (1.70 mm2) made of thin black plastic was attached to each cell for measurement of the J–V characteristics and the EQE spectra. All devices were tested in ambient air after UV-epoxy encapsulation.
4.4 Fabrication of Tandem-junction PSC
The device structure of the tandem cell is shown in Fig. 6a. The PDTBTBz-2Fanti (1.0 wt%):PC71BM (1.5 wt%) dissolved in CB (with 3 vol% DPE) was spin-cast on top of a PEDOT:PSS layer at a spin rate of 2500–3000 rpm as an active layer in the front cell. The ZnO nanoparticle solution was prepared following the previous literature59 and spin-coated at 3000 rpm on top of the front cell. The neutral PEDOT:PSS solution was also prepared by mixing isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and deionized water (DI water) with a mixing ratio of neutral PEDOT:PSS (1.0):IPA (0.8):DI water (1.4) as volume fraction, and then spin-coated on top of a ZnO layer at 4000 rpm for 40 s. The DT-PDPP2T-TT:PC71BM active layer was fabricated under the same conditions reported in the previous literature.44 Finally, the device fabrication was completed by deposition of 100 nm thick Al as the cathode.
4.5. Fabrication and characterization of PFETs
The PFETs were fabricated onto n++Si (500 μm)/SiO2 (300 nm) substrates (International Wafer Services Co.). The Ni (5 nm)/Au (50 nm) source and drain electrodes were patterned on the dielectrics by electron beam evaporation at 7 × 10−7 Torr. After ultraviolet/ozone treatment of pre-cleaned SiO2 substrates for 10 min, the substrates were passivated with n-decyltrichlorosilane (Gelest Inc.) in toluene solution (1% by volume) at 80 °C for 20 min in air. The semiconductor solutions were then spin cast from a chloroform solution (5 mg mL−1) at 1200 rpm for 40 s in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The devices were then cured at 200 °C for 5 min prior to measurements, and were tested using a probe station (Signatone Co.) in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. Data were collected using a Keithley 4200 system.

Broader context
Renewable and eco-friendly energy sources such as photovoltaic cell technologies have been tremendously improved and extensively implemented in order to replace environmentally harmful energy sources over the past several decades. In particular, polymer solar cells (PSC) have attracted increasing attention because of their many advantages such as mechanical flexibility, solution processability and low cost, which make them an attractive technology to satisfy future energy demands. As a result of a collective worldwide endeavor to develop PSCs, device efficiency has improved considerably over a short period of time. Despite significant improvements in device efficiency, current power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of PSCs have not yet been sufficient for their widespread commercialization. To solve this challenge, multi-junction bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs are considered a promising route for further improvement of device performance, by utilizing optimal combinations of both wide and small band gap polymers. In this work, we report a new series of semi-crystalline conjugated polymers with wide band gaps of over 1.90 eV, which demonstrate a high PCE of 9.8% in single-junction BHJ devices as well as a PCE of 10.3% in tandem devices. We believe that our results provide an effective pathway to realize the commercial application of PSCs.
