Broader context
The photo physical properties and carrier generation mechanisms of high efficiency non-fullerene acceptor-based organic photovoltaic blends are not well understood. Our work reveals the unique photo physical properties and carrier generation mechanisms of high efficiency non-fullerene acceptor-based organic photovoltaic blends. The analysis of device performance, morphology, and photo physics reveals that the interface carrier generation cannot support the device's current output. It is seen that primary photon excitons can dissociate into charge carriers in Y6, which displays a time scale of ∼0.3 ps with polaron yields above 28% in neat and blended thin films. This characteristic in combination with a large exciton diffusion length enables high morphology tolerance in Y6 overloaded blends. The carrier generation process is also combined with recombination studies. The recombination rate quantified by flux-dependent transient absorption measurements yields less than 5% total recombination and nearly 0% geminate recombination. These results define the advantages of the Y6 non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) and reveal the fundamental importance of developing new NFA materials with superior photo physical properties.

Introduction
The performance of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices has been improved in the past few years due to the quick development of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), which exhibit broad absorption and low energy loss carrier generation that contribute to the high photocurrent and output voltage.1–10 Morphologically, the high crystallization nature of NFA leads to multi-length-scale phase separation and robust electron transport highways that contribute to improved charge transport and collection.11–14 Y6 is the state-of-the-art NFA, and exhibits interesting photophysical properties such as negligible charge-transfer state,15,16 small binding energy,17,18 and intra-moiety excited state.19 These properties result in efficient charge generation and low recombination, contributing to improved power conversion efficiency (PCE).20
The generation, transport, and recombination have always been key issues in device performance. Multiple mechanisms have been observed. For example, free charge generation from excitons has been observed in polymer films on an ultrafast time scale without the presence of donor/acceptor interfaces.21 And excitons could dissociate extrinsically at interfaces between molecularly ordered and disordered domains in the regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) film at 10 K via hot exciton dissociation.22 These observations lead to more complex photophysical behaviors in NFA OPVs. Although much effort has been devoted to exploring the physical behavior and device impact of NFAs, the quantitative knowledge obtained is limited.13,16,23–25 A major obstacle is that the photovoltaic process is strongly influenced by the thin film morphology because the interface and crystalline domains are key structures that dictate exciton dissociation and carrier transport.11,26–29 Besides, the fundamental material properties, such as exciton diffusion length, mobility, and recombination, are morphology dependent and difficult to accurately assess.14,30–33 Manipulating the donor/acceptor blending composition to bias the donor/acceptor pure phase constitution is a convenient method to tune morphology without adding new materials, which provides an ideal platform to investigate exciton diffusion, charge generation, transport and recombination influenced by morphology features and material properties.34,35 This approach is applied in PM6:Y6 blends with largely varied composition ratios to explore the fundamental photo physical properties and the impact on device performances. It is observed that Y6-dominated solar cells show much better performance compared to PM6-dominated blend solar cells, which is due to the higher exciton and carrier diffusion of the acceptor domain. A spontaneous carrier generation mechanism is identified, which contributes to the high Jsc in Y6-overloaded devices. In balanced donor:acceptor blends, an optimized multi-length-scale morphology is obtained, which maximizes exciton diffusion and carrier transport, and minimizes the exciton and carrier recombination, leading to significantly improved Jsc and FF. The change in the blending ratio also influences the form factor of the acceptor phase. More narrower and thinner Y6 fibrils are obtained that increase the domain interface and reduce the volume of the mixing zone. These observations reveal the key device physics of the high efficiency PM6:Y6 blends and suggest that matching fundamental physical properties with a suitable morphology is the required avenue towards high performance solar cells.
Results
The impact of the D:A blend ratio on solar cell performance
The chemical structures of PM6 and Y6 and both their absorptions are shown in Fig. 1a and Fig. S1 (ESI†), respectively. As the concentration of Y6 increases, the corresponding absorption increases accordingly. When the Y6 content is around 50%, the blended films exhibit balanced absorption in the range of 400–900 nm. Solar cell devices were fabricated using an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:Y6/PNDIT-F3N-Br/Ag structure. The active layer was spin-cast from a chloroform solution with a varied D/A weight ratio ranging from 9:1 to 1:9. The corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. 1b, and detailed parameters are summarized in Table 1. PM6:Y6 blend devices with a ratio of 1:1 exhibited the optimal photovoltaic performance, showing a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 26.42 mA cm−2, an FF of 77.65%, and a PCE of 17.23%. The limiting Jsc is calculated by assuming unity quantum efficiency for all energies above the band gap.36 As shown in Fig. 1c, high Y6 composition possesses Jscs close to the limiting value, indicating that Y6 in blends is more efficient in generating current, which is due to absorption and morphology issues. A more favorable Voc contribution is seen in high PM6 composition, and the FF remains high at higher Y6 concentration (Fig. 1d). Both Jsc and FF decrease significantly when a large amount of PM6 is used, where Y6 was only present in the mixing domain and but could not form a percolated pure phase, leading to unfavorable carrier generation and transport behaviors. Under extreme conditions, the 10% PM6-based device shows a PCE of 10.42% of the optimized value, meanwhile, the 10% Y6-based device only shows a PCE of 0.57% of the optimized value. These results thus demonstrate that the different morphology sectors play quite different photophysical functions to dictate device performances. In Fig. 1d, as the concentration of Y6 increases, Voc decreases. Following previous reports of other material systems, this Voc loss could result from a lower LUMO of Y6 caused by Y6 aggregation/crystallization.37

The EQE of the photovoltaic devices was measured to investigate the wavelength response associated with composition changes (see Fig. 1e and f). Quite unexpectedly, the high amount of PM6 composition leads to a high relative contribution of EQE in the PM6 absorption region. However, the absolute value is still much lower compared to the optimized composition. For Y6 dominated blends, a much higher EQE response in the whole spectrum range is observed, which suggests that a more efficient charge collection can be achieved. Balanced EQE responses were obtained when PM6:Y6 ranges from 3:7 to 8:2, which suggests a large composition tolerance of Y6 components in blends. The EQE/Abs spectrum of 9:1 and 1:9 is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), which shows that Y6 is more efficient in charge generation, and PM6 needs to form a percolated phase and is associated with an acceptor domain to perform carrier generation. In general, the asymmetry of electronic property and morphology of this series of devices suggests that the underlying working mechanism of PM6:Y6 blends needs to be further explored.
The morphology of BHJ blends with different compositions
We then investigated the morphology of PM6:Y6 blends with different compositions. As discussed above, Y6 is less sensitive to the composition variation. In other words, once the Y6 percolated domain is formed, high efficiency charge separation and transport can be maintained. The PM6 in the pure phase or mixing region could perform hole transport efficiently. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) was carried out to study the ordering of PM6 and Y6. The 2D diffraction patterns of neat PM6 and Y6 films are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). PM6 displays a broad (100) reflection in the in-plane (IP) direction at 0.28 Å−1, a (001) scattering peak at 0.65 Å−1 in the IP direction, and a pi–pi stacking peak in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction at 1.69 Å−1. Y6 shows a pi–pi stacking peak at 1.75 Å−1 in the OOP direction, a (110) lamellae stacking peak at 0.27 Å−1 in the IP direction, and (020) and (11−1) diffractions in the IP direction. For PM6:Y6 BHJ thin films, the 2D diffraction patterns and line-cut profiles are shown in Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI†) and Fig. 2a. The PM6 (100) diffraction and the Y6 (110) diffraction are merged together, and their pi–pi stackings are also overlaid, which can only be used to estimate relative crystallization. The Y6 (020) and (11−1) diffraction planes can be used to track Y6 crystallization. The key structure information is summarized in Fig. 2b–d. With the increase of Y6, the lamellar peak area slightly increases from 9:1 to 1:1 and then decreases. The pi–pi stacking peak increases significantly from 9:1 to 1:1 and then reduces slowly. These results suggest that the preferred growth in the pi–pi stacking direction is improved with more Y6 content, which is beneficial for charge transport. The Y6 (020) and (11−1) diffraction peaks are not obvious when the Y6 content is lower than 30%, and they then quickly increase with more Y6 content, indicating that a percolated Y6 domain starts to form. These two diffractions are associated with Y6 fibril growth (Fig. 2e),33,34 where the (020) diffraction reflects the ordered structure in the fibril width direction, and the (11−1) diffraction reflects the order in the fibril long axis direction. This structure is critical in promoting the charge generation and transport function. It should be noted that when the Y6 content is higher than 50%, the CCL of (020) shows a slight increase upon the content increase, while the CCL of (11−1) diffraction continues to grow significantly, thus longer Y6 fibrils with high crystallinity are formed. In general, the Y6 percolated phase enables a good performance in the device, and at low PM6 concentration, the polymer chains are not likely to form interconnected domains, and they are most probably deposited in the mixing region. Thus, the mixing region is a good carrier generation and hole transport domain, which can contribute to the electronic properties of the mixture. For high PM6 blends, PM6 forms the percolated p-type domain and the mixing phase takes the responsibility of electron transport, which is less efficient and retards the device performances. For a balanced composition, a multi-length-scale morphology is formed, which boosts a more balanced transport behavior of both holes and electrons, leading to an improved FF. It is also expected that the mixing region in this morphology is low in volume, and thus less recombination and higher domain interfaces benefit for device performance improvement.

Exciton/polaron dynamics and polaron yields
With the known framework of morphology, we then investigated the exciton and carrier dynamics of PM6:Y6 blends to explore the specific character of each component. Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS) was carried out to investigate the charge transfer and excited state absorption (ESA).35 The decay lifetimes of photon-generated species were obtained to correlate with the morphology and device performance. The excitation wavelength of 800 nm was used to excite only acceptors. The color plot of TAS of the neat Y6 film and PM6:Y6 (1:1) blended thin films is shown in Fig. S7 and S8 (ESI†). Representative TAS line-cut profiles with indicated delay times are shown in Fig. 3a. The bleach peaks at ∼730 nm and ∼830 nm appear in both neat and blended Y6 thin films, originated from the stimulated emission (SE) and ground-state bleach (GSB) of Y6. With the decay of the Y6 bleach peak at 700–935 nm, bleach peaks at 550–650 nm appear in the TA spectrum of the PM6:Y6 blended thin film, which arises from the PM6 component. As shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†), the bleach decaying process of the Y6 photoexcited species agrees well with the rising process of the PM6 GSB signal, confirming photoexcited hole transfer from Y6 to PM6. The GSB kinetics in the PM6 rising profile was fitted with the bi-exponential function, yielding time constants of 0.45 ± 0.02 and 12.84 ± 1.19 ps, which were assigned to ultrafast exciton dissociation at the interface (fast component) and the exciton diffusion in Y6 toward interfaces before dissociation (slow component). The hole transfer processes in other blends are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), and the hole transfer kinetics and time constants for all blended thin films are summarized in Fig. 3b and c. The composition change leads to an obvious change in hole transfer kinetics, and a transition is seen in 1:1 blends. With the increase of Y6, the τ1 is slowly decreasing and then remains constant in the Y6-dominated thin film, which indicates that the increasing Y6 in the mixing region enhances a quick hole transfer process. Overloaded Y6 would form a percolated Y6 domain, which does not affect the mixing region composition. The τ2 value increases with increasing Y6, which is more obvious under high Y6 loading conditions, indicating the domain size increase of Y6. The weight coefficients A1 and A2 for τ1 and τ2 in fitting reflect the contribution from the mixing phase and crystalline interface hole transfer contribution. As shown in Fig. 3d, A1 that represents the mixing phase hole transfer process decreases with increasing Y6 concentration. A2 (diffusion mediated process) shows the opposite trend. A relatively balanced A1 of 51.84% and A2 of 48.16% are obtained in 1:1 blends. These results suggest that in optimized composition, the mixing region and pure domain become balanced, which leads to a large Jsc and FF.

(h) Comparison between PY at the D/A interface and EQE at 800 nm. 
The electron and hole lifetimes of PM6:Y6 blends that were extracted from 800 nm and 950 nm kinetics are shown in Fig. 3e and Fig. S14 (ESI†).18 The highest values are obtained in 1:1 blends simultaneously, indicating that this condition has the lowest recombination. At high Y6 concentration, the electron lifetime decreases slowly, and the hole lifetime reduces significantly. Thus, the hole recombination is one of the major reasons for a decrease in performance. It also suggests that a balanced morphology is highly necessary in BHJ blends, which maintains the high carrier lifetime to enhance Jsc. To explore the exciton dissociation efficiency, the photoluminescence quenching yield (PLQY) is measured (Fig. 3f and Fig. S15–17, ESI†). When the Y6 content increases from 10% to 50%, the PLQY of the donor (PLQD) gradually increases from 53% to 95%, and when the Y6 content increases from 50% to 100%, the PLQD reaches 100%. For the PLQY of the acceptor (PLQA), the low Y6 concentration below 50% retains a PLQA above 95%, and at a high Y6 concentration, this value gradually decreases to 85%, which is much higher compared to PLQD. The hole transfer efficiency is shown in Fig. 3F, which takes into account the photoinduced hole transfer in competition with intrinsic relaxation.36,37 The detailed calculation of hole transfer efficiency can be seen in Note S2 (ESI†). It is seen that the PLQA is much higher than hole transfer efficiency. The PLQA summaries all the dissociation probabilities of the Y6 exciton, and the hole transfer efficiency stands for the probability of charge transfer at D/A interfaces. Thus, there should be other exciton dissociation channels in blended thin films. The polaron yield (PY) at different delay times as shown in Fig. 3g (the detailed calculation can be seen in Note S3, ESI†)38 was then calculated. The color depth indicates the change of polaron yields. The black guideline is the distribution of the color bar, which helps to indicate the trend of polaron yields. The steeper the curve, the higher the polaron yields. It is seen that at a low Y6 concentration, the peak polaron yield is obtained at an early delay time around 1 ps, and for high Y6 concentration blends, the peak polaron yield appears at around 50 ps, indicating that the exciton in the Y6 crystalline domain plays a more significant role. The highest polaron yield is obtained in 1:1 blends and across a large time window, which best balances the mixing domain and crystalline domain contributions. The highest polaron yields and EQE response at 800 nm are compared, where the EQE value is a step higher than polaron yields, indicating that the rate constant deconvoluted polaron yield is not the single avenue of carrier generation.
Spontaneous carrier generation in the Y6 acceptor
The above-discussed results suggest that there are multiple carrier generation channels in PM6:Y6 blends, which in combination with interface exciton splitting generate current. The ESA signal at 1550 nm is accredited to the intra-moiety excitation (i-EX) with both electrons and holes localized at Y6 molecules of the same moiety.18 In TAS, this region is quite broad, and can contain complicated signals. The ESA of the Y6 neat thin film was investigated, and a quite strong ESA can be seen from 1300–1600 nm in Fig. 4a. Additionally, in different time-delayed profiles, the ESA peak position gradually changes from 1550 nm to 1450 nm (Fig. 4b), indicating a state transformation. The TAS measurement of the neat Y6 film at 80 K and 300 K was performed, and it was found that this peak blue shifts faster at 300 K than at 80 K (Fig. 4c), which indicates that the generation of this new species is a thermal-assisted process. These results suggest that the 1450-nm peak is an indicator of carriers freely generated in the neat Y6 film. This signal is also seen in PM6:Y6 blend films (Fig. S8 and S11 in the 10 ps delayed profile, ESI†), indicating the spontaneous carrier generation in blend films. As shown in Fig. S20 and S21 (ESI†), the 1450 nm peak rises exponentially with a time constant of 0.33 ps, which is similar to interface carrier generation dynamics. Concentration-dependent measurements were used to determine the polaron absorption cross-section at 1450 nm. Y6 is dissolved in chloroform with a concentration of 1–5 mg ml−1. The concentration-dependent TAS and polaron absorption optical density are shown in Fig. 4d and e, from which an absorption cross-section is determined. The polaron yield of the neat Y6 film was then calculated, and it was found to reach up to 29.3%. The spontaneous polaron generation for the blended thin films is also evaluated (Fig. 4f). It is seen that the polaron yield increases with higher Y6 concentration and becomes saturated at 1:1 blends with a value of 28%. These results explain the high current density in Y6-dominated devices, and thus Y6 is not highly sensitive to the blend composition change.

The spontaneous carrier generation can be traced back to its chemical origin. Y6 is an A–D–A hybrid structure, which will lead to electron cloud polarization and is stabilized by the surrounding environment. The TAS of the Y6 solution was then performed. An ESA signal at 1400 nm is seen, which is of the same nature as that in the neat thin film (Fig. 4g and h and Fig. S22 and S23, ESI†). Solvents of different polarities are used, and the carrier lifetime and polaron yield in solution and thin films are calculated (Fig. 4i and Fig. S24, ESI†). It is seen that the polaron yield and carrier lifetime increase when the solvent polarity increases, and the maximum value is obtained in the thin film. Thus, a polarized environment is helpful in free carrier generation and stabilizes the carrier. In the thin film, the crystalline lattice contains strong pi–pi stacking, which can be considered as a strong quadrupole interaction that induces a higher polaron yield. The crystalline lattice is expected to better host the generated carriers so that a longer lifetime is thus obtained. According to the molecular dynamic simulations, Y6 in the crystalline field exhibits a large static quadrupole moment (QXX = −1609.69, QYY = −1214.48, QZZ = −1126.135 Å) as shown in Fig. S25 (ESI†), which explains the free exciton splitting process.14 The electrostatic potential surfaces of Y6, chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), and toluene are shown in Fig. S26 (ESI†). The dipole moments of Y6, CF, CB, and toluene molecules are shown in Tables S4–S6 (ESI†). The large quadrupolar moments of Y6 and the specific A–D–A molecular architecture create an electrostatic bias potential that compensates the Coulomb binding of the exciton, which enables barrier-free dissociation of the Y6 exciton.
Exciton and carrier recombination in devices
The multiple carrier generation channels enable high current output, which strongly depends on thin film morphology and transport properties. The space-charge limited current (SCLC) method is carried out to evaluate the carrier mobility of electrons and holes using single carrier devices (Fig. 5a). The electron mobilities reached a high value of 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 when the composition of Y6 is larger than 33%, indicating the formation of the Y6 percolated pathway. With low Y6 composition, Y6 mainly resides in the mixing region, and the electron mobility reduces significantly. In contrast, a low PM6 composition can still transport holes, which leads to a relatively high performance in high Y6 concentration devices. The charge recombination kinetics are evaluated by transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements.39 The charge carrier lifetime under 1 sun is shown in Fig. 5b, and shows a similar trend with Jsc. As shown in Fig. S27a (ESI†), the carrier lifetime of the Y6 dominated device is much longer than that of the PM6 dominated device, allowing for much less carrier annihilation and trap-assisted recombination in Y6 dominated solar cells. The charge density in devices is determined using the differential capacitance method, with results shown in Fig. S27b (ESI†), which shows a clear exponential dependence on Voc. With the data summarized in Table S7 (ESI†), the nongeminate recombination rate coefficient k(n) that is defined by k(n) = 1/(τ(n)n) can be determined, where τ(n) is the carrier lifetime and n is the carrier density, and the results are shown in Fig. 5c and Fig. S28 and S29 (ESI†). Indeed, the 1:1 device exhibits the lowest recombination rate coefficient, while the recombination rate coefficient of PM6-dominated blend solar cells is significantly higher.

The exciton annihilation method was used to measure the exciton diffusion constant of neat and blended thin films via transient absorption spectroscopy to measure exciton lifetimes as a function of excitation density.40Fig. 5d and e show the exciton decay of Y6 and PM6 neat thin films. The exciton diffusion length LD is estimated to be 39 nm for Y6 and 13 nm for PM6 (Fig. 5f) and the detailed calculations can be seen in Note S4 (ESI†). The comparatively large LD for Y6 supports the high efficiency for high Y6 composition devices. Exciton recombination loss is an important factor that determines the feasibility of the charge separation process, which, however, is hard to be quantitatively evaluated. The TAS zone integration method is used to solve this issue.41 The photo-induced exciton and free carrier absorption signal are used to estimate the quantity of these species. The total exciton recombination is obtained by comparing the integration value of the 0 fs delayed signal and the maximum polaron state signal. As shown in Fig. 5g, excitation of the acceptor initially bleaches the ground states of the acceptor. These GSB features at 0 fs resemble the excitonic signatures of the neat acceptor, and the GSB signal at around 20 ps reaches its maximum, where the charge generation is in the linear region. To avoid the disturbance of the polaron absorption signal at around 800 nm, the singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis is used to extract the clean ground state bleach signal. We integrated the ground state bleach over the entire photobleached area at 0 fs (PB0) and 20 ps (PB20) and (1-PB0/PB20) resembles the total recombination loss ratio in blended films. The decay dynamics of the TAS signals were then analyzed to evaluate the ratio of geminate and nongeminate recombination. The geminate recombination is flux-independent and reduces the quantum efficiency by a fixed factor at all illumination intensities.42 The nongeminate recombination depends on the charge density and is flux-dependent. We carried out global fitting to obtain the carrier kinetics under different pumping energies using the Onsager–Braun model43 and evaluated the nongeminate recombination ratio (f) and the geminate recombination ratio (1−f). The decay traces of the PA signals are shown in Fig. 5h and Fig. S30 (ESI†) with pump energies between 3 μJ cm−2 and 30 μJ cm−2, and the quantitative recombination ratios are shown in Fig. 5i. It is seen that the total recombination reduces significantly with the optimal blending ratio, and only 5% total recombination is obtained in 1:1 blends. The geminate recombination is barely visible in optimized blending ratios, and the high PM6 composition leads to significantly increased germinate recombination, which is due to reduced exciton diffusion length. The nongeminate recombination is also lower in Y6 rich blends, which indicates better charge extraction efficiency in these thin films.
Multivariable correlation analysis covering device performance (including Jsc and FF), (010) peak area, electron and hole lifetime, spontaneous polaron yields, nongeminate recombination loss and total recombination loss has been carried out. The confidence ellipse plot is shown in Fig. S31 (ESI†), and the associated correlation index r is also provided. Red (blue) indicates a positive (negative) correlation, and a narrower ellipse shape with a larger value indicates a stronger correlation. It is seen that the (010) peak area is an important factor that accounts for the Jsc and FF in photovoltaic devices. Nongeminate recombination and total recombination loss are highly dependent on thin film morphology, which reveals that optimizing the blend film crystallinity is key to suppress recombination loss. Spontaneous polaron yield contributes remarkably to Jsc of the photovoltaic device, which emphasizes the advantage of the Y6 molecule. In addition, the correlation between τe and Jsc is nearly unity (r = 0.99), which highlights the importance of optimizing the crystallinity of the Y6 phase.
Conclusion
In summary, we have investigated the morphology-dependent photophysical process and device performance of PM6:Y6 blends. The key issues covering exciton and carrier dynamics and recombination have been studied, and their correlation with morphological features has been revealed. The spontaneous carrier generation from the Y6 domain has been identified, which plays an important role in raising the Jsc and subsequent PCE of the devices. The mixing domain is more efficient in hole transport that results in high device performance with a low PM6 concentration. The exciton diffusion length of Y6 is much longer compared to that of PM6, guaranteeing high carrier generation with high Y6 loading. On the carrier side, the trap-assisted recombination is significantly reduced at the balanced donor:acceptor blending ratio, and a much longer carrier lifetime is seen for the overloaded Y6 acceptor. On the exciton side, the total recombination is extremely low in 1:1 blends, and a high PM6 loading results in enormous germinate and non-germinate recombination, which is due to the poor exciton dissociation efficiency in the mixed region. These results suggest that optimizing the morphology to obtain a reduced mixing region developing an efficient mixing region interface to separate the exciton is an important trait to improve the device performance. This improvement of the device performance calls for a thorough consideration in manipulating the electronic properties of donor and acceptor materials as well as achieving a suitable morphology that aligns with the physical properties such as exciton and carrier diffusion lengths.

Broader context
The photo physical properties and carrier generation mechanisms of high efficiency non-fullerene acceptor-based organic photovoltaic blends are not well understood. Our work reveals the unique photo physical properties and carrier generation mechanisms of high efficiency non-fullerene acceptor-based organic photovoltaic blends. The analysis of device performance, morphology, and photo physics reveals that the interface carrier generation cannot support the device's current output. It is seen that primary photon excitons can dissociate into charge carriers in Y6, which displays a time scale of ∼0.3 ps with polaron yields above 28% in neat and blended thin films. This characteristic in combination with a large exciton diffusion length enables high morphology tolerance in Y6 overloaded blends. The carrier generation process is also combined with recombination studies. The recombination rate quantified by flux-dependent transient absorption measurements yields less than 5% total recombination and nearly 0% geminate recombination. These results define the advantages of the Y6 non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) and reveal the fundamental importance of developing new NFA materials with superior photo physical properties.
