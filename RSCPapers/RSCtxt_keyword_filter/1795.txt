    , Accepted 1st January 2022First published on 4th January 2022AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have developed rapidly and achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of over 25% with diverse technical routes. However, defect is a major factor for device degradation, so a high-quality perovskite film with low defect density is critical to device performance. Here, we fabricate highly efficient and stable PSCs by introducing butyramidinium chloride (BRCl) into PbI2 precursor solution. BRCl retards the nucleation and accelerates the crystal growth of perovskite by interacting with PbI2, thereby obtaining high-quality crystalline perovskite films with large grains and few defects. In addition, BRCl effectively passivates the defects and reduces non-radiative recombination in the resultant film. Accordingly, planar n-i-p PSCs achieve a champion PCE of 23.27%. Importantly, the device stability under thermal, ambient and illumination stress is improved. Notably, non-encapsulated BRCl-assisted devices retained 93% of their initial PCE after over 1000 h under maximum power point tracking (MPP) in a N2 atmosphere.
Introduction
In recent years, halide perovskite materials have been considered as ideal candidates for next-generation photovoltaic materials due to their superior photoelectric properties such as tunable band gaps,1,2 large absorption coefficients,3 small exciton binding energies,4 long carrier diffusion lengths,5,6 efficient photogeneration of free carriers and high charge carrier mobility.5,7 After over ten years of development, the current certified efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) prepared in the laboratory has reached up to 25.5%.4,8–12 Moreover, PSCs have great cost potential to directly compete with other established PV technologies due to a low-temperature coating process using inexpensive materials. However, the low-temperature solution processing and rapid crystal growth inevitably lead to polycrystalline perovskite films containing a large number of defects.13,14 These defects in the perovskite lattice serve as non-radiative recombination centers, reducing device efficiency. Even worse, the defects assist ion migration and component loss, thereby deteriorating the long-term stability of PSCs.15,16 Therefore, reducing the defect density of the perovskite photoactive layer by improving perovskite crystallization is an effective approach to improve the performance of PSCs.
Several strategies have been successfully applied to obtain high-quality crystalline perovskite films.17–26 Among them, additive engineering is an effective means to influence the crystallization kinetics of halide perovskites.21,27–29 A wide range of additives have been previously introduced into the perovskite precursor solution, such as small organic molecules,30–33 metal halide salts,34–36 and polymers.37 Some additive species can improve the crystallization of perovskite, while others passivate defects at perovskite grain boundaries (GBs). Most of these additive materials often have a single function to improve perovskite performance. It is urgent to extend the spectrum of additives to achieve multiple functions, so as to obtain efficient and stable PSCs or other perovskite-based devices.
Here, we introduce butyramidinium chloride (BRCl) into the PbI2 precursor solution to modulate the crystal growth of halide perovskites. The chemical interaction between the Lewis base BRCl and Lewis acid PbI2 retards the nucleation of perovskite during the deposition of organic salts and accelerates crystal growth, thus obtaining high-quality crystalline perovskite films with larger grains and fewer defects. In addition, BRCl retained at GBs has strong interaction with the perovskite film, which effectively passivates the defects and inhibit carrier recombination. As a result, BRCl-assisted devices exhibit a champion PCE of 23.27% with a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.14 V. Moreover, BRCl-assisted devices show enhanced thermal stability, ambient stability and photostability. Notably, non-encapsulated BRCl-assisted devices retain 93% of their initial PCE after over 1000 h maximum power point (MPP) tracking in a N2 atmosphere. Our findings demonstrate that amidinium compounds effectively modulate perovskite film properties, which extends the spectrum of additives beyond common amine compounds.

Consult.)
Device fabrication
The ITO substrate was cleaned with ultrapure water, acetone and ethanol successively. After 30 min of ultraviolet O3 treatments, a SnO2 nanocrystal solution was spin-coated on the substrate at 4000 rpm for 30 s to form a 50 nm-thick film, which was then annealed at 150 °C for 30 min in air. Control perovskite films were fabricated by a two-step solution process: PbI2 (1.3 M, dissolved in DMF/DMSO (9:1, v/v)) mixed with 9% CsI was spin-coated on ITO/SnO2 at 2300 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 70 °C for 1 min in a nitrogen glovebox. After cooling the PbI2-coated substrate to room temperature in a nitrogen glovebox, a mixed organic cation solution (0.47 M FAI and 0.12 M MACl, dissolved in isopropanol) was spin-coated at 2600 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 10 min in air. After perovskite formation, the sample was transferred to a N2 glove box. 3 mg of PEAI was dissolved in 1 mL isopropanol and spin-coated on the perovskite surface at 5000 rpm for 30 s, without any further processing. Then the HTM solution, in which a spiro-OMeTAD/chlorobenzene (72.3 mg mL−1) solution was employed with the addition of 35 μL Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (260 mg mL−1) and 30 μL 4-tertbutylpyridine, was deposited by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 100 nm Au was thermally evaporated as a counter electrode under a pressure of 5 × 10−5 Pa on top of the hole transport layer to form the metal contact. For the BRCl-assisted perovskite films, we dissolved a certain amount of BRCl in DMF/DMSO (9:1, v/v), and used it as a solvent to dissolve the PbI2 powder. The other steps are all the same as for the control samples. For both thermal stability and MPP stability tests, the PEAI passivation layer was removed. The PEAI layer would gradually transform into the PEA2PbI4 phase under heating (illumination can also cause the heating effect), which brought about a significant efficiency drop.9,38 For preparing the powder sample characterized by FTIR, the molar ratio of BRCl to PbI2 was 1:1.
Oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD films and complete solar cells
The preparation of the spiro-OMeTAD solution and the deposition of the spiro-OMeTAD layer are carried out in a glovebox filled with dry air. Before the deposition of the Au electrode, the devices were aged in the dark in an oxygen-filled sealed drying chamber for 12 hours. After the deposition of the Au electrode, the devices were also aged in the dark in an oxygen-filled sealed drying chamber for 12 hours.39,40
Characterization
Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained by using a Hitachi S4800 field emission scanning electron microscope. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a Rigaku D/Max 2200 with Cu Kα as the X-ray source. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed by using a Nanolog FL3-2iHR (Horiba Jobin Yvon). Dynamic light scattering measurements (DLS) were performed by using a 90Plus PALS (Brookhaven Instruments Corporation). Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded by using a FLS980 (Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.), equipped with a Xe lamp, a liquid nitrogen cryostat (Oxford Instruments, OptistatDN-V), and a photomultiplier tube (PMT) detector. The excitation wavelength was 470 nm. A picosecond pulsed diode laser (EPL-470, Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.) was used to measure the PL lifetime with a repetition rate of 0.2 MHz, a pulse width of 91.5 ps, an excitation fluence of 30 nJ cm−2, and a maximum average power of 5 mW. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) were performed using a Bruker Dimension 5000 Scanning Probe Microscope (SPM). The UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded with a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Agilent 8453). The grain-size distributions of perovskite grain size were calculated by using image pro plus. The photocurrent was measured under AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 under a Newport Thermal Oriel 91192 1000 W solar simulator. J–V measurements were carried out in N2 air. The sweep speed was fixed at 420 mV s−1 (step 0.02 V and delay time 1 ms). The light intensity was calibrated using a KG-5 Si diode. The effective area of each cell was 0.102 cm2 defined by masks for all the photovoltaic devices discussed in this work. All J–V measurements were conducted under xenon lamps, and only the MPP tracking experiment and the photo-stability experiment used LED white light lamps for aging. External quantum efficiencies (EQE) were obtained by using an Enli Technology (Taiwan) EQE measurement system. The parameters for this EDS measurements are as follows: the accelerating voltage is 7 kV or 15 kV, data collection time is 60 s and model of the EDS detector is a Thermo Scientific NORAN System 7 without calibration.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the schematic diagram of the perovskite film fabrication process by a two-step spin-coating method. Briefly, the PbI2 precursor solution with different BRCl concentrations is spin-coated on a SnO2 substrate and annealed to obtain a PbI2 film. Then the solution of organic salts is spin-coated on top of the PbI2 film, followed by thermal annealing to form a perovskite film. In Fig. 1b, we show the top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of perovskite films with different BRCl concentrations, and the corresponding distributions of grain size are plotted in Fig. 1c. It is obvious that the grain size of perovskite increases gradually with the increase of the BRCl content. The control perovskite film (0 mg mL−1 BRCl) displays a dense, pinhole-free morphology with an average grain size of 750 nm. The grain size obtained from 0.005 mg mL−1 BRCl is 810 nm, and the grain size further increases to 960 nm for 0.05 mg mL−1 BRCl. By further increasing the BRCl concentration to 0.5 mg mL−1, a film with a larger average grain size of 1100 nm is obtained. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images (Fig. S1†) also show that the BRCl-assisted perovskite film exhibits increased grain size as well as reduced roughness, indicating an improvement in the film morphology.

The improved morphology of the film may be due to BRCl as an additive to change the crystallization of perovskite. To study the coordination of BRCl and PbI2 in precursor solution, we conduct Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In Fig. 2a, we show the spectra of three samples, including pure BRCl powder (BRCl), powder obtained from DMF/DMSO solution containing BRCl (BRCl–DMF/DMSO), and powder obtained from DMF/DMSO solution containing BRCl and PbI2 (BRCl + PbI2–DMF/DMSO). The stretching vibrations of CN and N–H bonds in BRCl are observed at 1688 and 3061 cm−1, respectively. Compared with BRCl, the FTIR spectrum of BRCl–DMF/DMSO does not exhibit a substantial peak shift, so the interaction between BRCl and DMF/DMSO can be ignored. However, in BRCl + PbI2–DMF/DMSO, the vibration peaks are obviously shifted to a lower wavenumber for CN to 1669 cm−1 and a higher wavenumber for N–H to 3144 cm−1, indicating that the CN bond weakens due to the strong interaction between N and Pb, and the N–H bond strengthens due to the relatively weak bonding with I.29 In addition, we observe that the colloidal particle size in the PbI2 precursor solution increases with the introduction of BRCl (Fig. S2†), indicating the formation of a BRCl–PbI2 adduct. The above results confirm the interaction between the Lewis base BRCl and Lewis acid PbI2. This information allows us to form a clear understanding of the role of BRCl in the crystallization of the perovskite film. The BRCl–PbI2 interaction can retard the nucleation of perovskite during the deposition of organic salts. As crystallization proceeds, BRCl is expelled from the crystallizing 3D perovskite domains, but appears to act as a flux, accelerating crystal growth, as shown in Fig. S3 and S4.†31 This additive-assisted crystallization is beneficial to form high-quality perovskite crystals with larger grains and fewer defects.17 To confirm the retention of BRCl in perovskite films, we have performed thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements, as shown in Fig. S5.† The TGA results show that BRCl begins to decompose at about 230 °C, which indicates that BRCl does not escape from the perovskite film at 150 °C during film annealing. To further investigate the location of BRCl, we have carried out scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) characterization. Possibly because of the low sensitivity of our EDS coupled with SEM, we cannot get apparent Cl signals when we performed EDS line scan (Fig. S6†). However, results from point scan show the difference. As shown in Fig. S7,† there is no signal of Cl either in the grain or at the grain boundary for the control film. However, for the BRCl-assisted film, a weak signal of Cl appears at the grain boundary, while there is no signal of Cl in the grain. So we speculate that BRCl may exist at grain boundaries. The molar ratio of I/Pb is less than 3 at grain boundaries, indicative of a number of under-coordinated lead ions.

To further investigate the effect of BRCl on the crystallization of perovskite films, we record the XRD patterns of perovskite films with different BRCl concentrations, as shown in Fig. 2b. In the control sample (0 mg mL−1 BRCl), the main characteristic peaks at 14.0° (100), 24.5° (111), and 28.3° (200) are assigned to the α-phase perovskite, which is consistent with previously reported results.41 With the introduction of BRCl, narrower diffraction peaks (Fig. S8†) are observed in the films, indicative of higher crystallinity. However, as the BRCl concentration increases further, the peak intensity of PbI2 at 12.7° increases, while the diffraction peak of perovskite widens. This is because excess BRCl–PbI2 adducts prevent the infiltration of organic salts into the PbI2 film. Besides, the introduction of BRCl does not change the bandgap of the perovskite film (Fig. S9†).
X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) reveals an additional Cl 2p peak in the BRCl-assisted perovskite film (Fig. S10†), indicating the retention of BRCl in the film. Furthermore, the Pb 4f core level (Fig. 2c) shifts to higher binding energies for the BRCl-assisted perovskite film, indicating a strong electronic interaction between BRCl and Pb in the perovskite film. It means that the BRCl retained at GBs can effectively passivate the defects generated by uncoordinated Pb atoms.29,42,43 In order to further investigate the passivation effect of BRCl, we introduced a passivation layer for comparison. A 1 mg mL−1 BRCl salt solution was spin-coated onto the perovskite film, which was then annealed at 100 °C for 5 min in N2. We performed PL measurement for perovskite films with and without surface passivation. Perovskite films with surface passivation show an enhanced PL intensity with a similar grain size (Fig. S11a and b†), which suggests that BRCl can effectively passivate defects without changing the grain size of perovskite.
High-quality films and grain boundary passivation will contribute to the reduction of non-radiative recombination. To verify this, we perform time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements on the corresponding perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 2d, the BRCl-assisted film exhibits a longer carrier lifetime than the control film. The control film exhibits a fast decay of τ1 = 71.6 ns and τ2 = 293.2 ns (fitting details are summarized in Table S1†). In contrast, the BRCl-assisted film shows a slow decay of τ1 = 85.8 ns and τ2 = 434.0 ns. It is consistent with the enhanced steady-state PL intensity (Fig. S12†), indicating a reduction in carrier non-radiative recombination.
To quantitatively access the trap density in perovskite films, devices with a structure of ITO/perovskite/Au are fabricated, and the trap density is calculated based on space-charge-limited current (SCLC) curves in the dark. The trap density (Nt) can be calculated according to the following equation:  where VTFL is the onset voltage of the trap filled limit, q is the elementary charge of electrons, L is the thickness of the deposited perovskite layer (determined from the step profiler data in Table S2†), ε0 represents the vacuum permittivity and εr represents the relative dielectric constant (εr = 28.8).44,45Fig. 2e and f show the SCLC curves of the representative devices based on control and BRCl-assisted films. We obtain a VTFL of 0.67 V and 0.16 V for control and BRCl-assisted devices, respectively, and the corresponding trap densities are estimated to be 5.43 × 1016 and 1.31 × 1016 cm−3. It can be seen that the trap density substantially decreases with the introduction of BRCl, which is consistent with the PL and TRPL results.
Based on the above perovskite films, we fabricate planar solar cells with the architecture of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au, as shown in Fig. 3a. The solar cell efficiencies with different concentrations of BRCl are investigated, and the results are summarized in Fig. 3b and S13.† The PCE increases significantly when the perovskite films are fabricated with a low concentration of BRCl solution, and the PCE reaches a maximum at 0.05 mg mL−1. However, the device efficiency begins to drop at high BRCl concentration, which may be due to excessive PbI2 residue in the perovskite films. Unless otherwise stated, this optimal condition is used for BRCl samples in the subsequent text.

(e) VOC histogram of 25 devices each for the control and BRCl-assisted PSCs, fitted with Gaussian distribution (indicated with solid lines). (f) VOC as a function of incident light intensity. 
The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of reverse and forward scans for the best BRCl-assisted and control devices are shown in Fig. 3c. The best BRCl-assisted device produces a PCE of 23.27%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.14 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 24.77 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 82.28%. By holding a bias near the maximum power point (MPP, 0.98 V), the BRCl-assisted device achieves a stabilized photocurrent of 23.27 mA cm−2, corresponding to a stabilized efficiency of 22.81% (Fig. 3d). In contrast, the control device exhibits a VOC of 1.10 V, a JSC of 24.27 mA cm−2, and a FF of 81.15%, yielding a PCE of 21.59%. It can be seen that the JSC increases slightly (the corresponding integrated JSC values obtained from the IPCE spectra are shown in Fig. S14†), while VOC substantially increases compared with the control device. The increased VOC depends on the reduced non-radiative recombination in perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 3e, the BRCl-assisted devices exhibit a higher average VOC with a narrower distribution in comparison with the control devices, which shows a good reproducibility. This superior repeatability can be attributed to the high-quality perovskite films crystallized with the involvement of BRCl.
To extract information on the charge recombination in the devices, the VOC dependence on light intensity measurement is conducted. As shown in Fig. 3f, the BRCl-assisted device exhibits a much smaller slope of 1.16 kBT/q than the control device (1.40 kBT/q). We also perform transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements, as shown in Fig. S15.† The BRCl-assisted device demonstrates a longer carrier recombination lifetime than the control device. The above results all indicate a substantially reduced charge recombination, which is consistent with TRPL results.
To investigate the effect of BRCl on device stability, a series of stability tests are conducted on unencapsulated control and BRCl-assisted devices, as shown in Fig. 4. First, we examine the long-term stability of PSCs at 85 °C in a N2 glove-box. As shown in Fig. 4a, the BRCl-assisted devices retain 92% of their initial PCE after 1000 h, whereas the control devices show faster degradation to 85% of their initial PCE (the tracking curves of VOC, FF and JSC are drawn in Fig. S16†). We further examine the operational stability of devices under continuous illumination (LED sources) with MPP tracking in a N2 atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 4b, the BRCl-assisted devices retain 93% of their initial PCE after 1000 h, while the control devices show a continuous PCE decrease to 70% of their initial PCE. In addition, we evaluate the operational stability of devices under continuous illumination with MPP tracking in ambient air with a relative humidity (RH) of 20–30% at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 4c, the BRCl-assisted devices retain over 85% of their initial PCE after 300 h, while the control devices show a rapid degradation to 61% of their initial PCE. These thermal, light and ambient stability testing results indicate that the BRCl-assisted devices exhibit better stability than the control devices. It can be attributed to the improved film quality and grain boundary passivation induced by BRCl, which effectively reduce the defect density and stabilize the perovskite lattice.46,47

Conclusions
In summary, we reveal the effects of BRCl as an additive on perovskite film growth. First, BRCl successfully affects the coordination of the PbI2 complex, thereby changing the nucleation rate of perovskite during the deposition of organic salts and accelerating crystal growth to obtain perovskite films with a larger grain size. Moreover, BRCl is retained at GBs, which effectively passivates the defects and inhibit carrier recombination. Eventually, the resulting PSCs achieve a champion PCE of 23.27% with improved stability performance under thermal, ambient and illumination stress. MPP tracking for non-encapsulated BRCl-assisted devices shows that they retain 93% of their initial PCE after over 1000 h in a N2 atmosphere. These results suggest that amidinium compounds are a promising additive species to obtain high-quality polycrystalline perovskite films and grain boundary passivation, which is beneficial for efficient and stable perovskite-based devices.
