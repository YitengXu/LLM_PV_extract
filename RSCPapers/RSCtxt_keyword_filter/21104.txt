    , Accepted 22nd July 2017First published on 25th July 2017AbstractA number of recent studies have focused on improving the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Cells with a ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag structure have attracted particular attention because of their excellent power conversion efficiencies. Using a dendritic crystal ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor and Ag in conjunction leads to different charge-transfer (CT) processes, and this is the main theoretical basis for the improvement of DSSC performances. Thus, in the present study, TiO2/N3, ZnO/N3, ZnO-TiO2/N3, TiO2/N3/Ag, ZnO/N3/Ag, and ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag assemblies have been fabricated and their CT processes have been monitored by using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectra, with particular focus on the differences caused by the synergistic effect of the ZnO-TiO2 component. The dye loading capacity of the dendritic crystal ZnO-TiO2 is much larger than that of TiO2. There are extra enhancements in the SERS intensity and degree of CT (ρCT) in ZnO-TiO2/N3 compared to ZnO + TiO2/N3 (based on a simulation curve for the physically mixed TiO2 and ZnO semiconductors) with 476.5 nm excitation due to the synergistic effect of the ZnO-TiO2 component. And these enhancements in ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag compared to ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag appear with 476.5 and 532 nm excitation, which are particularly large with 532 nm excitation. Accordingly, the participation of Ag in this synergistic effect can reduce its energy threshold, which will make it easier to appear. Finally, to rationalize these extra enhancements, the models describing the CT mechanism have been proposed. Thus, the use of the dendritic crystal ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor in the semiconductor/N3/Ag system can improve the adsorption capacity of N3 compared to that with TiO2. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect of ZnO-TiO2 and Ag can promote the CT process, demonstrating that ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag is an excellent structure for DSSCs.
1 Introduction
Following the first report by Oregan and Gratzel in 1991,1 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have gained increasing attention as attractive candidates for new renewable energy sources because of their high efficiency, low cost, flexibility, environmental benignity, and ease of manufacture.2–7 In this kind of cell, Ru(II)-polypyridyl dyes adsorb photons to generate excited electrons, which are transferred efficiently to the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor.8 Thus, the amount of dye loading and the charge-transfer (CT) properties of DSSCs are key criteria for a high incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE). However, upon continuous CT to the CB of the semiconductor, the injected electrons accumulate at the semiconductor interface. This accelerates back electron transfer, in which the electrons in the CB of the semiconductor transfer back to the dyes and recombine with the photoinduced holes, significantly limiting the efficiency of the DSSCs.9
In order to improve the efficiency of DSSCs, it is often effective to use a composite semiconductor with an appropriate CB and valence band (VB), which can hinder the recombination of electron–hole pairs owing to the transfer of the charge carriers from one semiconductor to the other.10,11 Diverse composite semiconductors, including TiO2-SnO2,12 CdS-TiO2,13 In2O3-In2S3,14 CdS-ZnS,15 SnO2/ZnO,16 and ZnO-TiO2,17–20 have been utilized in DSSCs. Of these, significant attention has been paid to the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor because it combines the inherent properties, including low cost, non-toxicity, and high photocatalytic activity of the primary component semiconductors, while simultaneously providing a synergistic effect due to the CT process. This enhances the charge separation efficiency, increases the photoinduced-charge-carrier lifetime, and improves the degree of CT (ρCT).21–23 A large number of studies have reported the superior performance of DSSCs based on the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor. For example, John et al.11 reported a seven-fold enhancement of efficiency for a DSSC based on Zn-doped TiO2 nanotube (Zn-TONT)/ZnO nanoflakes compared to that based on pure TONTs. Furthermore, Ahmad et al.24 reported that the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs based on ZnO/TiO2 films is 8.10%, an improvement of 28% compared to that of pure-TiO2-based cells.
In addition, noble metal nanoparticles (NPs), such as Ag, Au, and Cu NPs, have been utilized to improve the efficiency of DSSCs. Localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) generated around the surface of metal NPs can increase the optical absorption and enlarge the spectral response region of a material,25–27 which can enhance its utilization of sunlight. Furthermore, introducing metal NPs into a semiconductor–dye system28,29 offers a new pathway by which electrons can be transferred from the dye to the metal NPs, as demonstrated by the enhanced ρCT for TiO2/N3/Ag compared to that for TiO2/N3 reported in our previous work.30,31 Thus, many excellent improvements in DSSC efficiency have been achieved by exploiting the dual role of metal NPs. According to a report by Dissanayake et al.,32 the efficiencies of TiO2:AuNP- and TiO2:AgNP-based DSSCs are 6.23 and 6.51%, respectively, showing a 21.6 (AuNPs) and 27% (AgNPs) efficiency enhancement compared to that of a TiO2-based DSSC. Furthermore, Kim et al.33 reported that the efficiency of TiO2 NPs can be enhanced from 8.7 to 10.3% by introducing Ag nanoplates.
Thus, much attention has been paid to cells with the ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag structure, which features the composite semiconductor ZnO-TiO2 and Ag simultaneously, owing to their excellent performance.34 Recent studies have primarily focused on increasing the efficiency of such cells. However, the main theoretical basis for improving the performance of DSSCs, i.e., enhancing the CT process, has not been explored sufficiently. Thus, investigating the CT process at the interfaces in DSSCs is crucial to improving their IPCE.
With the advancement of surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), the range of active substrates has expanded from unitary materials, metals, or semiconductors to systems containing both a metal and a semiconductor.35–41 This allows both the electromagnetic mechanism (EM) allowed by the metal and the chemical mechanism (CM) allowed by the CT process to act between an adsorbed molecule and the substrate in the system, leading to remarkable Raman enhancement and SERS profiles different from those of the unitary material substrates.35,36 Accordingly, SERS has great potential for obtaining information about the interface of DSSCs containing both a semiconductor and a noble metal, especially information about the CT process, which is the basis for improving their efficiency. For example, Tian's group42–44 investigated photoinduced charge transfer (PICT) processes in N719 (ditetrabutylammoniumcis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II)) adsorbed on Ag@TiO2, Ag@SiO2, and Ag2@TiO2 core–shell NPs utilizing electrochemical SERS (EC-SERS).
However, the unknown features of the CT process in systems containing a dye, a semiconductor, and a noble metal, which must be more deeply understood for optimizing the performance of DSSCs, present ample research space for future exploration. In our previous studies,30,31 a series of studies on the CT processes in Ag/N719/n-TiO2 and TiO2/N3/Ag systems were conducted. We concluded that some lines in the Raman spectra of the N719 and N3 dye molecules are quite sensitive to CT, while other lines are less sensitive. Thus, the concept of ρCT proposed by Lombardi et al.45,46 has been utilized to assess CT processes quantitatively under adjustable contributions from chemical effects,30,31 while the dependency of the CT process on laser excitation energy has been discussed with the help of energy level diagrams.
In this study, we have prepared a dendritic crystal ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor as a basic substrate to fabricate a ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag system. This kind of dendritic crystal semiconductor possesses a high surface area, leading to enhanced dye loading and thus light harvesting that is more efficient than that of traditional NP semiconductors.47,48 This enhanced loading can be confirmed by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) analysis of the N3 solution remaining after it has been used for assembly with the TiO2, ZnO, and ZnO-TiO2 semiconductors. To explore the effects of the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor and Ag NPs, SERS spectra of semiconductor/N3 (476.5 and 532 nm) and semiconductor/N3/Ag (476.5, 532, 633, and 785 nm) systems (where the semiconductor is ZnO, TiO2, or ZnO-TiO2) were recorded and analyzed. For quantitative and continuous investigation of CT processes, the complex composite-semiconductor/dye/noble-metal system ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag has been analyzed with reference to the ρCT concept. The behavior of this system depends on the electromagnetic mechanism (EM) allowed by the Ag NPs and the chemical mechanism (CM) allowed by CT between the N3 dye and the semiconductor (or Ag NPs). Besides the CT processes exhibited by the semiconductor/dye and semiconductor/dye/Ag (Ag/N719/n-TiO2 and TiO2/N3/Ag) systems reported in our previous studies,30,31 an extra synergistic effect is provided by CT in the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor; this effect has never been investigated by SERS. To explore the synergistic effect of the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor, a physically mixed (i.e., uncomposited) semiconductor, ZnO + TiO2, in which there are no interactions between the two components, is assumed. Thus, the SERS intensities and ρCT values of ZnO-TiO2/N3, ZnO + TiO2/N3, ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag, and ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag are compared.
Furthermore, the Ag NPs in this system can enhance optical absorption and enlarge the spectral response region, which can improve the utilization of sunlight. They also provide a new CT pathway (N3 to Ag) and influence the energy threshold of the synergistic effect due to the CT process, which can be confirmed by observing the variation of SERS intensities and ρCT values in ZnO-TiO2/N3, ZnO + TiO2/N3, ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag, and ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag. Finally, the CT mechanisms in ZnO-TiO2/N3 and ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag have been proposed with the help of an energy level model.

2.2.1.1 Preparation of the TiO2 precursor. 
First, 3.5 ml of tetrabutyl titanate and 0.2 ml of 98% sulfuric acid were added to a mixed solution of 2 ml of distilled water and 50 ml of anhydrous ethanol. After 10 minutes of vigorous agitation, the as-prepared sol was kept at 180 °C for five hours in a stainless-steel vessel and then cooled to room temperature. Subsequently, the sol-hydrothermal product was filtered and washed with water and tetrabutyl titanate. Finally, it was dried at 40 °C for six hours to obtain the TiO2 precursor.
2.2.1.2 Preparation of the ZnO-TiO2 composite precursor. 
First, 0.5 g of the TiO2 precursor and 3 g of zinc nitrate hexahydrate were added to 20 ml of a 5 M aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. After mixing, the as-prepared solution was kept at 120 °C for 12 hours in a stainless-steel vessel, and then cooled to room temperature. Subsequently, the product was filtered and washed with water and tetrabutyl titanate. Finally, it was dried at 60 °C for 12 hours to obtain the ZnO-TiO2 composite precursor. The theoretical content of ZnO and TiO2 was 35.71 and 64.29%, respectively.
A TiO2-free ZnO composite precursor (and vice versa) was prepared for comparison based on the above experimental conditions. Finally, TiO2, ZnO, and ZnO-TiO2 semiconductors were obtained by calcining the precursors at 450 °C for two hours.


2.2.2 Preparation of Ag NPs. 
The Ag colloid used in this work was prepared using a method reported by Lee and Meisel.49 Briefly, 200 mL of a 1.0 mM aqueous Ag nitrate solution was reduced using 4 mL of 1% trisodium citrate.


2.2.3 Preparation of semiconductor–dye and semiconductor–dye-metal assemblies. 
First, 10 mg of semiconductor (TiO2, ZnO, or ZnO-TiO2) was dissolved in 4 ml of a 1 × 10−5 M N3 ethanol solution. After stirring the mixture for 12 hours, it was centrifuged and rinsed with anhydrous ethanol to obtain TiO2/N3, ZnO/N3, or ZnO-TiO2/N3 assemblies. Then, a mixture of 2 ml Ag sol and 2 ml anhydrous ethanol was added to the TiO2/N3, ZnO/N3, or ZnO-TiO2/N3 assemblies. After stirring the mixture for six hours, it was centrifuged and rinsed with anhydrous ethanol to obtain TiO2/N3/Ag, ZnO/N3/Ag, or ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag assemblies.

2.3 Sample characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Siemens D5005 X-ray powder diffractometer with a CuKα radiation source at 40 kV and 30 mA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained using a JEM-2100 at 200 kV. The UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded with a Shimadzu U-4100 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The UV-Vis-near infrared (NIR) spectra were obtained with a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer.

In this work, the Raman spectra of N3 molecules in different assemblies were collected from the solid powder samples. Because of the limitations of the instruments, the measured wavenumber regions were 600–2300 cm−1 for the 476.5 nm excitation, 200–2000 cm−1 for the 785 nm excitation, and 200–2300 cm−1 for the 532 and 633 nm excitation.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the semiconductors

Fig. 1 shows representative XRD patterns of the three semiconductors: (a) TiO2, (b) ZnO-TiO2, and (c) ZnO. The XRD results indicate that the crystal structures of TiO2 and ZnO used in this work are anatase and wurtzite, respectively. The assignments of the XRD peaks of the semiconductors are shown in Table 1. According to the Scherrer formula (D = k λ/(βcosθ)),50 the crystalline diameters (D) of ZnO and TiO2 are approximately 71.5 and 9.5 nm, respectively. In the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor, there are no obvious differences in the characteristic peaks compared to the peaks for ZnO and TiO2, indicating that TiO2 does not enter the ZnO lattice. According to the half peak width (β) of the ZnO and TiO2 XRD peaks, the crystalline diameters (D) of ZnO and TiO2 are approximately 18.8 and 9.1 nm, respectively, which means that the composition of TiO2 with ZnO can restrain their crystal growth.51

To further understand the basic details of the interface in the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor, XPS spectra were recorded for the (a) TiO2, (b) ZnO, and (c) ZnO-TiO2 semiconductors. The existence of Zn, Ti, O, and C in the full XPS survey spectra (Fig. 2(A)) indicates the successful deposition of TiO2 onto the ZnO surface. As shown in Fig. 2(B), the XPS spectra of ZnO show that peaks due to Zn2p3/2 and Zn2p1/2 are located at 1021.9 and 1045.3 eV, respectively, and the binding energy difference is 23.4 eV, indicating that Zn exists as Zn2+ in the ZnO semiconductor. In the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor, these two peaks are shifted to 1021.7 and 1044.7 eV, respectively, with a similar binding energy difference of 23 eV, showing that Zn2+ is also dominantly present in the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor. The shift to lower binding energy is caused by changes in the charge transfer from Zn2+ to O2−. It can be seen from the XPS spectra of TiO2 in Fig. 2(C) that the peaks for Ti2p3/2 and Ti2p1/2 are found at 459.7 and 465.4 eV, respectively, presenting a binding energy difference of 5.7 eV. This variation reveals that Ti exists as Ti4+ in the TiO2 semiconductor. In the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor, these two peaks shift to 458.7 and 464.3 eV, respectively, maintaining the binding energy difference of 5.6 eV. This demonstrates that Ti4+ is dominantly present in the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor. The shift to lower binding energy is caused by coupling with the electron rich ZnO. The C 1s peak was used for calibration. A summary of the XPS spectra is presented in Table 2.

Fig. 3 depicts representative TEM images of the three semiconductors: (A) TiO2, (B) ZnO, and (C) ZnO-TiO2. Combining the TEM results with those from XRD reveals that TiO2 exists as ∼9.5 nm nanospheres and ZnO exists as ∼1.5 μm dendritic crystals composed of 71.5 nm-size ZnO features. Fig. 3(D) and (E) show the Ti and Zn elemental mapping images for a part of ZnO-TiO2 semiconductors. Combining the TEM and elemental mapping images, TiO2 and ZnO are combined together in ZnO-TiO2. And the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor presents larger (∼2 μm) dendritic crystals composed of 18.8 nm ZnO and 9.1 nm TiO2 features. Furthermore, the ends of the branches become more specific, changing from spherical-shaped (ZnO) to leaf-shaped.

According to the above basic characterization, the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor was synthesized successfully utilizing the two-step hydrothermal synthesis method, and that it is micron-sized overall with nano-sized branch ends.
3.2 UV-Vis and Raman spectra of semiconductor, semiconductor–dye and semiconductor–dye-metal assemblies

Fig. 4 shows the UV-Vis DRS of the semiconductor, semiconductor–dye, and semiconductor–dye-metal assemblies. The main absorption peaks for the TiO2, ZnO, and ZnO-TiO2 semiconductors are located in the UV region, which are associated with the band–band transmission of the semiconductor. The absorption peaks for TiO2 and ZnO are found at 319 and 358 nm, respectively. After deposition of TiO2 onto the ZnO surface, the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor presents an absorption peak at a similar position (∼319 nm) to that of TiO2. Meanwhile, in the 340–370 nm region, the intensity of the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor is enhanced compared to that of TiO2 by the influence of the interaction between the ZnO and TiO2, suggesting that the composition of TiO2 with ZnO enhances their UV absorption capacities. After assembling the N3 dye onto these three semiconductors, a new band appears in the 490–510 nm region owing to the influence of the N3 dye molecule. After Ag NPs are assembled on the semiconductor–dye assemblies, a new band appears in the 430–470 nm region and the tails are enhanced in the 600–800 nm region, because of the LSPR effect of the Ag NPs. Furthermore, the absorptions of TiO2/N3/Ag and ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag in the visible region are remarkably enhanced, implying that these semiconductor–dye-metal assemblies show enhanced visible absorption capacities. The absorption of ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag is higher than those of ZnO/N3/Ag and TiO2/N3/Ag in the 500–800 nm region, indicating that the interaction between ZnO and TiO2 influences the LSPR. Thus, both the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor and the introduction of Ag NPs to the semiconductor–dye assembly can enhance absorption of light, which is crucial for improving the performance of DSSCs.
 Fig. 4  UV-Vis DRS of the semiconductor (TiO2, ZnO, and ZnO-TiO2 marked with solid lines of different colors), semiconductor–dye assemblies (TiO2/N3, ZnO/N3, and ZnO-TiO2/N3 marked with dotted lines of different colors), and semiconductor–dye-metal assemblies (TiO2/N3/Ag, ZnO/N3/Ag, and ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag marked with broken lines of different colors). 
After the adsorption of N3 onto the surface of a semiconductor, there are still some N3 molecules left in the solution. The UV-Vis spectra of the remaining N3 solution after assembling with (a) TiO2, (b) ZnO, and (c) ZnO-TiO2 are shown in Fig. 5(A). It is clear that ZnO has a higher N3 adsorption capacity than TiO2. After the composition of ZnO and TiO2, the N3 adsorption capacity is markedly enhanced to a similar degree to that with ZnO, which is beneficial to both the performance and SERS signals of DSSCs. Fig. 5(B) and (C) show the SERS spectra of (a) TiO2/N3, (b) ZnO/N3, and (c) ZnO-TiO2/N3 recorded with excitation wavelengths of 476.5 and 532 nm, respectively. The specific chemical binding type in the semiconductor–N3 system and the band assignments (Table S1†) are shown in the ESI.† The peak at 1470 cm−1 due to ν(CC) of the bipyridine (bpy) ring is strong and stable, and thus we utilized its intensity to represent the intensity of the whole spectrum. The intensity of the peak at 1470 cm−1 in the SERS spectra is given in Table 3. The intensities at different excitation wavelengths in Fig. 5 are original values without normalization, and thus, we only compared the intensities of TiO2/N3, ZnO/N3, and ZnO-TiO2/N3 at the same excitation wavelength. All the intensities are the mean intensities from five SERS spectra. With 476.5 nm laser excitation, the ZnO/N3 assembly shows a higher Raman intensity than the TiO2/N3 assembly. The TiO2/N3 assembly presents a higher Raman intensity than the ZnO/N3 assembly with 532 nm laser excitation. After the composition of TiO2 and ZnO, the intensity of the ZnO-TiO2/N3 assembly is similar to that of the ZnO/N3 assembly with these two excitation wavelengths. There are no SERS signals for the ZnO-TiO2/N3 assembly for excitation wavelengths of 633 and 785 nm.

Because of the composited proportion of ZnO-TiO2, the total SERS intensity of the ZnO-TiO2/N3 system originates from the three parts: (1) 35.71% TiO2/N3, whose intensity can be expressed as ITiO2/N3, (2) 64.29% ZnO/N3, whose intensity can be expressed as IZnO/N3, and (3) the interactional and synergistic effects of the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor originating from the CT process due to chemical bonding between the ZnO and TiO2, whose intensity can be expressed as Isynergy(ZnO-TiO2/N3). Thus, the intensity of the ZnO-TiO2/N3 system can be represented by using the following equation: IZnO-TiO2/N3 = XTiO2ITiO2/N3 + XZnOIZnO/N3 + Isynergy(ZnO-TiO2/N3)(1)
Herein, XTiO2 and XZnO are the ratios of TiO2 and ZnO in the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor, respectively. To further explore the interactional and synergistic effects from the CT process between them, we assumed a kind of physically mixed semiconductor, ZnO + TiO2, with the same composition ratio as that of the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor. There is no extra interaction between TiO2 and ZnO in ZnO + TiO2. The simulated curve for ZnO + TiO2/N3 has been prepared according to the composition ratio of TiO2/N3 and ZnO/N3. Thus, the intensity of ZnO + TiO2/N3 can be represented by using the following equation: IZnO+TiO2/N3 = XTiO2ITiO2/N3 + XZnOIZnO/N3(2)
The simulated curves for ZnO + TiO2/N3 with excitation wavelengths of (B) 476.5 and (C) 532 nm are shown in Fig. 5 as broken lines. The corresponding intensities of the peaks at 1470 cm−1 for ZnO + TiO2/N3 are given in Table 4. It is worth noting that with 476.5 nm excitation, there is an extra enhancement of the real intensity of ZnO-TiO2/N3 compared to that of ZnO + TiO2/N3, which arises from the synergistic effect of TiO2 and ZnO caused by CT between them. However, with 532 nm laser excitation, the intensity of ZnO-TiO2/N3 is lower than that of ZnO + TiO2/N3. This means that with 532 nm laser excitation, there is no CT process between TiO2 and ZnO to generate a synergistic effect in the ZnO-TiO2/N3 system.

Fig. 6 shows the SERS spectra of (a) TiO2/N3/Ag, (b) ZnO/N3/Ag, and (c) ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag with excitation wavelengths of (A) 476.5, (B) 532, (C) 633, and (D) 785 nm. The intensities of the peaks at 1470 cm−1 at different excitation wavelengths are given in Table 4. After the introduction of Ag NPs into the semiconductor–N3 assemblies, their intensities increase by different degrees. It is obvious that ZnO/N3/Ag yields a higher intensity than TiO2/N3/Ag. After assembling TiO2 onto ZnO, ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag shows higher intensity than both TiO2/N3/Ag and ZnO/N3/Ag with excitation wavelengths of 476.5 and 532 nm. Furthermore, it shows a similar intensity to ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag with excitation wavelengths of 633 and 785 nm, which also presents higher intensity than TiO2/N3/Ag.
 Fig. 6  SERS spectra of (a) TiO2/N3/Ag, (b) ZnO/N3/Ag, and (c) ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag with excitation wavelengths of (A) 476.5, (B) 532, (C) 633, and (D) 785 nm. The broken lines represent simulated curves for ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag without interaction between ZnO and TiO2, whose intensity can be expressed as: IZnO+TiO2/N3/Ag = XTiO2ITiO2/N3/Ag + XZnOIZnO/N3/Ag. 
Being similar to the intensity of ZnO-TiO2/N3, the whole SERS intensity of the ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag system originates from the three parts: (1) 35.71% TiO2/N3/Ag, whose intensity can be expressed as ITiO2/N3/Ag, (2) 64.29% ZnO/N3/Ag, whose intensity can be expressed as IZnO/N3/Ag, and (3) the interactional and synergistic effects in the ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag system originating from the CT process, whose intensity can be expressed as Isynergy(ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag). Thus, the intensity of the whole ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag system can be represented by using the following equation: (3)
Under the above assumption that the ZnO + TiO2 physical mixture presents no extra interactional and synergistic effects, a simulated curve for ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag has been prepared according to the composition ratios of TiO2/N3/Ag and ZnO/N3/Ag. Thus, the simulated intensity for ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag can be represented by using the following equation: IZnO+TiO2/N3/Ag = XTiO2ITiO2/N3/Ag + XZnOIZnO/N3/Ag(4)
The simulated curves for ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag with excitation wavelengths of (A) 476.5, (B) 532, (C) 633, and (D) 785 nm are shown in Fig. 6 as broken lines. The corresponding intensities of the peaks at 1470 cm−1 for ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag are given in Table 4. It is worth noting that there is an extra enhancement of real intensity for ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag compared to that of ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag with all four excitation wavelengths, which is particularly large for 532 nm laser excitation. This extra enhancement arises from the synergistic effect of TiO2 and ZnO caused by the CT process between them.
According to the results from our previous work, in the SERS spectra of the Ag/N719/n-TiO2 and TiO2/N3/Ag systems, the band at 1267 cm−1 due to ν(CN) and ν(C–C) of bpy can be selectively enhanced by the CT effect, while the band at 1024 cm−1 due to the ring breathing of bpy is stable. Thus, we utilized these two kinds of bands to measure ρCT, which is helpful in describing the different CT process for various semiconductor/N3 and semiconductor/N3/Ag assemblies based on TiO2, ZnO, and ZnO-TiO2. Thus, ρCT can be estimated according to the following equation: (5)

Fig. 7 shows the ρCT for semiconductor/N3 and semiconductor/N3/Ag assemblies based on TiO2, ZnO, ZnO-TiO2, and ZnO + TiO2 with excitation wavelengths of (A) 476.5 and (B) 532 nm. With 476.5 nm excitation, the ρCT values for ZnO/N3 and TiO2/N3 are similar. However, with 532 nm excitation, the ρCT of ZnO/N3 is higher than that of TiO2/N3. To further explore the synergistic effect due to the existence of CT between TiO2 and ZnO in the ZnO-TiO2/N3 system, we compared the difference of ρCT between ZnO-TiO2/N3 and ZnO + TiO2/N3 (simulated results). Similar to the ZnO-TiO2/N3 system, the ρCT for ZnO-TiO2/N3 also originates from the following three parts: (1) 35.71% TiO2/N3, whose ρCT can be expressed as ρCT TiO2/N3, (2) 64.29% ZnO/N3, whose ρCT can be expressed as ρCT ZnO/N3, and (3) interactional and synergistic effects of the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor originating from the CT process (ZnO-TiO2/N3) due to chemical bonding between ZnO and TiO2, whose ρCT can be expressed as ρCTsynergy(ZnO-TiO2/N3). Thus, the intensity of the whole ZnO-TiO2/N3 system can be expressed as the following equation: (6)
 Fig. 7  Degree of CT (ρCT) for semiconductor/N3 and semiconductor/N3/Ag assemblies based on TiO2, ZnO, ZnO-TiO2, and ZnO + TiO2 (simulated results) with excitation wavelengths of (A) 476.5 and (B) 532 nm. The ρCT of ZnO + TiO2/N3 and ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag can be expressed as: ρCT ZnO+TiO2/N3 = XTiO2ρCT TiO2/N3 + XZnOρCT ZnO/N3 and ρCT ZnO+TiO2/N3/Ag = XTiO2ρCT TiO2/N3/Ag + XZnOρCT ZnO/N3/Ag. 
Under the above assumption that the ZnO + TiO2 physical mixture presents no extra interactional and synergistic effects, a simulation for the ρCT of ZnO + TiO2/N3 can be represented by using the following equation: ρCT ZnO+TiO2/N3 = XTiO2ρCT TiO2/N3 + XZnOρCT ZnO/N3(7)
It is worth noting that ZnO-TiO2/N3 exhibits higher ρCT compared to that for ZnO + TiO2/N3 with 476.5 nm excitation, whereas the enhancement of ρCT for ZnO-TiO2/N3 compared to that for ZnO + TiO2/N3 is not obvious with 532 nm laser excitation. Accordingly, the synergistic effect of ZnO-TiO2 due to CT processes can be evoked by 476.5 nm excitation in the ZnO-TiO2/N3 system, but not by the 532 nm excitation.
After introducing Ag NPs into the semiconductor/N3 assemblies, for excitation wavelengths of 532 and 476.5 nm, all the semiconductor/N3/Ag assemblies present higher ρCT values compared to those of semiconductor/N3 systems containing the same semiconductor.

Fig. 8 plots ρCT for TiO2/N3/Ag, ZnO/N3/Ag, and ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag assemblies as a function of laser energy. The ρCT fitting curves of these three assemblies present similar variation tendencies. In the lower laser energy range, the ρCT fitting curves present stable levels. As the energy exceeds ∼1.74 eV, the ρCT of every sample shows a rapid increasing tendency with increasing energy. Until the energy exceeds ∼2.2 eV they hold a saturated state. They all show a slight decrease after the energy exceeds 2.33 eV (532 nm).
 Fig. 8  Degree of CT (ρCT) for TiO2/N3/Ag, ZnO/N3/Ag, and ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag assemblies as a function of laser energy. The broken line represents the ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag simulation result without interaction between ZnO and TiO2, whose ρCT can be expressed as: ρCT ZnO+TiO2/N3/Ag = XTiO2ρCT TiO2/N3/Ag + XZnOρCT ZnO/N3/Ag. 
There are also differences among these three kinds of assemblies. With excitation wavelengths of 633 and 785 nm, the ρCT values of ZnO/N3/Ag and TiO2/N3/Ag are similar. However, with excitation wavelengths of 476.5 and 532 nm, the ρCT of TiO2/N3/Ag is higher than that of ZnO/N3/Ag. As shown in Table 4, the intensity of TiO2/N3/Ag is lower than that of ZnO/N3/Ag, and ρCT for TiO2/N3/Ag is higher than that of ZnO/N3/Ag, which means that the EM contribution to the whole SERS spectra of TiO2/N3/Ag is smaller than that for ZnO/N3/Ag. Thus, the tail enhancement in the 600–800 nm region shown in Fig. 4 due to LSPR contributes to the whole SERS spectra. The ρCT for ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag is similar to that for TiO2/N3/Ag, indicating that ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag undergoes a higher degree of CT than ZnO/N3/Ag.
To further explore the synergistic effect due to the existence of CT between TiO2 and ZnO in the ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag system, we compared the differences in ρCT between ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag and ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag. Similar to the intensity of ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag, the ρCT for ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag also originates from the following three parts: (1) 35.71% TiO2/N3/Ag, whose ρCT can be expressed as ρCT TiO2/N3/Ag, (2) 64.29% ZnO/N3/Ag, whose ρCT can be expressed as ρCT ZnO/N3/Ag, and (3) interactional and synergistic effects (ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag) in the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor originating from CT, whose ρCT can be expressed as ρCT synergy(ZnO+TiO2/N3/Ag). Thus, the intensity of the whole ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag system can be expressed as the following equation: (8)
Under the above assumption that the ZnO + TiO2 physical mixture presents no extra interactional and synergistic effects, a simulation for the ρCT of ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag can be represented by using the following equation: ρCT ZnO+TiO2/N3/Ag = XTiO2ρCT TiO2/N3/Ag + XZnOρCT ZnO/N3/Ag(9)
The simulated ρCT for ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag as a function of laser energy is shown in Fig. 8 by a dashed line. With excitation wavelengths of 633 and 785 nm, the ρCT values of ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag and ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag are similar. It is worth noting that ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag exhibits higher ρCT compared to that of ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag with excitation wavelengths of 532 and 476.5 nm, meaning that the synergistic effect in the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor enhances the contribution of CT processes in the ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag system.
According to the differences in SERS intensities and ρCT values between ZnO-TiO2/N3 and ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag, the synergistic effect due to CT processes can be evoked by 476.5 nm excitation in the ZnO-TiO2/N3 system, and can be evoked by 532 and 476.5 nm excitation in the ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag system. This means that the introduction of Ag NPs can reduce the energy threshold for the synergistic effect due to CT processes.
To explain the extra enhancement and different degrees of CT in the ZnO-TiO2/N3 and ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag assemblies, mechanistic models for the CT process are proposed in Fig. 9. It is widely believed that, referring to the vacuum level, the Fermi level of Ag is situated at −4.26 eV. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of N3 are situated at −6.01 and −3.65 eV, respectively. The CBs of ZnO and TiO2 are situated at −3.80 and −4.00 eV, and the VBs of ZnO and TiO2 are situated at −7.17 and −7.20 eV, respectively.
 Fig. 9  Proposed models for the CT mechanism in (A) ZnO-TiO2/N3 and (B) ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag assemblies. 
As illustrated schematically in Fig. 9(A), in the semiconductor/N3 systems based on TiO2, ZnO, and ZnO-TiO2, the excited electron is generated at the HOMO level of N3, and then transfers to the LUMO level of N3 or the CB level of the semiconductor, which can be expressed as CT(RR) and CT(N3-S), respectively. According to the energy levels, the energy barriers of CT(RR), CT(N3-S), and excitation wavelengths that can overcome them are summarized in Table 5. In the ZnO-TiO2/N3 system, with the sufficient energy of 476.5 and 532 nm laser excitation, there are some interactional and synergistic effects between ZnO and TiO2 (apart from the CT(RR) and CT(N3-S) processes) because of their similar band energies and interlaced energy levels. As the CB level of ZnO is 0.2 eV higher than that of TiO2, the electrons can constantly inject from the CB of ZnO to the CB of TiO2. Meanwhile, the photogenerated holes can transfer from the VB of TiO2 to the VB of ZnO and then transfer to the HOMO of N3. Here, an electron-accumulation layer is formed at the surface of the TiO2 and an electron-consummation layer is formed at the surface of the ZnO. At their interface, a built-in electric field is formed, the direction of which points from ZnO to TiO2. Under the effect of this built-in electric field, the photogenerated electron–hole pairs can separate rapidly. As the energy of 532 nm laser excitation is not sufficient to complete the synergistic effect, introducing TiO2 as an electronic injection layer can result in a higher ρCT for ZnO-TiO2/N3 than that for ZnO + TiO2/N3 with 476.5 nm laser excitation.

As schematically illustrated in Fig. 9(B), introducing Ag NPs into semiconductor/N3 assemblies can cause LSPR. Simultaneously, it can also provide a new CT pathway, i.e., the excited electrons can transfer to the Fermi level of Ag with the sufficient laser energy, which can be expressed as CT(N3-Ag). The energy barrier for CT(N3-Ag) and excitation wavelengths that can overcome it are summarized in Table 5. Similar to ZnO-TiO2/N3, CT(RR) and CT(N3-S) effects on the whole SERS spectrum exist for ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag. However, some differences exist in the synergistic effect for ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag, i.e., the electrons at the CB level of ZnO can inject into the CB level of TiO2 and then into the Fermi level of Ag. Thus, a built-in electric field, directed from ZnO to Ag via TiO2, is formed. Additionally, the introduction of Ag NPs can generate both the EM effect from the LSPR of Ag and a new CT pathway (with sufficient energy). Thus, for excitation wavelengths of 532 and 476.5 nm, all of the semiconductor/N3/Ag assemblies present higher ρCT compared to those of semiconductor/N3 containing the same semiconductor. The increased ρCT in TiO2/N3/Ag generated by the Ag NPs has been discussed in our previous work.
For TiO2/N3/Ag, ZnO/N3/Ag, and ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag assemblies, with 785 nm (1.58 eV) laser excitation, no CT process occurs. With 633 nm (1.96 eV) laser excitation, electrons can transfer from N3 to Ag, leading to a higher ρCT than that at 785 nm. With excitation wavelengths of 633 and 785 nm, no CT process involving the semiconductor occurs. Thus, with excitation wavelengths of 633 and 785 nm, the ρCT values for TiO2/N3/Ag, ZnO/N3/Ag, ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag, and ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag (simulated results) present similar values. CT(RR) and CT(N3-S) can occur with 532 (2.33 eV) and 476.5 nm (2.63 eV) laser excitation, which leads to different CT processes. There is a larger built-in electric field in ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag than that in ZnO-TiO2/N3. Accordingly, the presence of Ag can reduce the energy threshold of the synergistic effect due to CT. Thus, under the synergistic effect, there is an increase in ρCT for the ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag system compared to that for the ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag system under excitation wavelengths of 532 and 476.5 nm. Accordingly, in the ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag system, the synergistic effect originating from the CT processes among ZnO, TiO2, and Ag manifests when sufficient energy (476.5 and 532 nm laser excitation) is applied. As the energy barrier of CT(N3-S) matches 532 nm laser excitation, CT resonance occurs, and this maximizes the synergistic effect between ZnO and TiO2 and thus the ρCT. Therefore, with 532 nm laser excitation, the extra enhancement of intensity in Fig. 6 is significantly larger than that with other excitation wavelengths. Meanwhile, the ρCT 532 nm laser excitation is slightly larger than that with 476.5 nm excitation.
4 Conclusions
In this study, we first prepared a dendritic crystal ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor using a two-step hydrothermal synthesis method. The dendritic crystal composite semiconductor prepared was characterized by XRD, XPS, and TEM. Then, we utilized this semiconductor to fabricate a ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag system, which has a higher surface area for enhanced dye loading, thus improving light harvesting as compared to that of traditional NP semiconductors. For investigating CT in the ZnO-TiO2/N3 and ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag systems, especially the contribution from ZnO-TiO2, we fabricated TiO2/N3, ZnO/N3, ZnO-TiO2/N3, TiO2/N3/Ag, and ZnO/N3/Ag systems for comparison. It was found that the dye loading capacity of the dendritic crystal ZnO-TiO2 is enhanced to a degree similar to that of ZnO, and much larger than that of TiO2. To explore the effects of the ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor and Ag NPs, SERS spectra and the ρCT for semiconductor/N3 (476.5 and 532 nm) and semiconductor/N3/Ag systems (476.5, 532, 633, and 785 nm) based on ZnO, TiO2, and ZnO-TiO2 were recorded. The ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor can exhibit a synergistic effect due to CT between its components. Herein, we assumed a physically mixed semiconductor, ZnO + TiO2, in which there are no extra interactions between the components. The SERS intensities and ρCT values of its assemblies were simulated according to the TiO2 and ZnO composition ratio. With 476.5 nm laser excitation, there is an extra enhancement of SERS intensity and ρCT for ZnO-TiO2/N3 compared to those of ZnO + TiO2/N3. With 532 nm laser excitation, the intensity of ZnO-TiO2/N3 is lower than that of ZnO + TiO2/N3 and the enhancement of ρCT for ZnO-TiO2/N3 compared to that of ZnO + TiO2/N3 is not obvious. Thus, the synergistic effect of ZnO-TiO2 due to CT between the components can be evoked by 476.5 nm excitation in the ZnO-TiO2/N3 system, but not by 532 nm excitation. Upon introducing Ag NPs into the semiconductor/N3 assemblies, with excitation wavelengths of 476.5 and 532 nm all the semiconductor/N3/Ag assemblies present higher intensity and ρCT values compared to those of semiconductor/N3 systems containing the same semiconductor. There is an extra enhancement of the real intensity of ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag compared to that of ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag, which is particularly large with 532 nm excitation owing to CT resonance. With excitation wavelengths of 633 and 785 nm, the ρCT values of ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag and ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag are similar. When excitation wavelengths of 476.5 and 532 nm are employed, the ρCT for ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag is higher than that for ZnO + TiO2/N3/Ag. Accordingly, the synergistic effect due to CT among ZnO, TiO2, and Ag can be evoked by excitation wavelengths of 476.5 and 532 nm in the ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag system, meaning that the introduction of Ag NPs can reduce the energy threshold of the synergistic effect due to CT. Finally, to rationalize the enhancements of intensity and ρCT for ZnO-TiO2/N3 compared to those of the ZnO-TiO2/N3/Ag system, two models describing the CT mechanism were proposed.
Thus, utilizing a dendritic crystal ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor in semiconductor/N3/Ag systems can both significantly improve the adsorption capacity of N3 (compared to that with TiO2) and generate a synergistic effect caused by the CT process between the ZnO and TiO2 components of the composite. At the same time, introducing Ag NPs into this system can enhance its optical absorption, enlarge its spectral response region, offer a new CT pathway (N3 to Ag), and reduce the energy threshold of the synergistic effect due to CT. Thus, semiconductor/N3/Ag systems based on the dendritic crystal ZnO-TiO2 composite semiconductor are an excellent potential structure for DSSCs.
