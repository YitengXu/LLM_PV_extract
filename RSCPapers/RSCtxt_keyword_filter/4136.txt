    , Accepted 4th September 2018First published on 10th September 2018AbstractPorous TiO2 electrodes were prepared by oxidizing two-dimensional titanium carbide nanosheets (Ti3C2 MXene) and the electrodes were tested in dye-sensitized solar cells. The effects of oxidation temperature and duration time together with various thicknesses on the device performance were investigated. A power conversion efficiency of 2.66% was observed.
Recently, TiO2 nanocrystals were synthesized by the oxidation of two-dimensional (2D) titanium carbides, Ti3C2 and Ti2C, by high temperature flash oxidation,1 annealing in a CO2 atmosphere at 850 °C2 or 800 °C,3 chemical reactions,4 high-energy ball milling,5 calcination6 and aging in air.7 These two carbides belong to a family of 2D materials called MXenes and are usually synthesized by selective etching of the A-element layer from their ternary carbide precursors, such as the MAX phase.8–10 Some MXenes, including Ti3C2, rheologically behave like clay and can be used to prepare additive-free flexible homogenous films.9 MXenes have emerged as promising electrodes for energy storage devices such as batteries and electrochemical capacitors.10–12 The partial or complete oxidation of MXenes into transition metal oxides has already been demonstrated and used to improve performance of lithium ion batteries1–4 and photocatalysis.5,6
TiO2 has been used as mesoporous semiconductor electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).13 To prepare the electrode, typically a paste containing 15–25 nm TiO2 particles, an organic dispersant and a polymer binder is applied on a transparent conducting substrate (typically SnO2:F, FTO, on a glass) and annealed at around 500 °C in air. The pore size and its distribution can be controlled by the amount of additives added to the paste.14 For the electrolyte, the I−/I3− redox couple has been typically used for DSSCs. Since 2010, Co complexes have been commonly used as redox couples due to their more positive redox potentials.15 Since the size of the complexes is relatively large, the pore size of the electrodes needs to be enlarged to reduce the resistance against the diffusion of the Co complexes. However, if the pore size is enlarged, the mechanical strength of the film is decreased, making it difficult to fabricate thick TiO2 films. Such films are needed to employ sensitizers whose absorption coefficients are high. Ru complex dyes have a wide absorption spectrum but low absorption coefficients. Thus, these dyes have not been utilized with Co complex redox couples because there is no method to fabricate thick and large pore TiO2 electrodes. Therefore, it would be beneficial to explore alternative methods to fabricate porous TiO2 electrodes rather than the method that uses a paste containing nanoparticles. Here, we propose the coating of MXene nanosheets as precursors on FTO for the formation of porous TiO2 films. To do so, we study the fabrication conditions to form porous TiO2 films from the nanosheet and evaluate its performance in DSSCs. Then we discuss the applicability of the fabrication methods for DSSCs.

Fig. 1a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-deposited Ti3C2 film on FTO and the heat-treated films at different heating temperatures and times. After heating at 150 °C, the (002) and (004) peaks of the Ti3C2 films were shifted to higher angles, corresponding to a 5.69 Å decrease of the c-lattice parameter, showing the desorption of a layer of water molecules that were trapped between Ti3C2 nanosheets during their synthesis and it is coherent with previous work.16,17 After treatment at 250 °C for 30 min, the (002) peak almost disappeared, the (004) peak disappeared completely and peaks corresponding to rutile and anatase-type TiO2 appeared. The formation of rutile at this temperature is not common, because rutile is usually synthetized at higher temperature,18,19 except via a hydrothermal method.20,21 This could be due to an effect of the substrate, or carbon doping, or oxygen vacancies, but further work is needed to fully understand this phenomenon. When the oxidation time at 250 °C was extended to 80 min, the Ti3C2 oxidation reaction continued further and consequently the (002) peak disappeared in the corresponding XRD pattern. Concerning the samples oxidized at higher temperature, no peak position changed but the intensity of the peaks corresponding to TiO2 increased with temperature. Using the Scherrer equation22 in the sample treated at 450 °C for 30 min, the crystal sizes of anatase and rutile TiO2 are estimated to be 8 nm and 11 nm, respectively.
 Fig. 1  XRD patterns of Ti3C2 coated on FTO electrodes for the pristine sample as well as the oxidized ones at different temperatures and duration times in air (a), and TG-DSC curves of Ti3C2 under an air flow from room temperature to 500 °C (b). 
To further understand TiO2 formation from the oxidation of Ti3C2 in air, the thermal stability of Ti3C2 was investigated via thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC), as shown in Fig. 1b. The initial mass loss from room temperature to 140 °C is attributed to the desorption of water. The DSC curves present several exothermic peaks. As the mass increases from 140 °C to 334 °C, the peaks at 216 °C, 280 °C and 328 °C correspond to the oxidation of Ti3C2 into TiO2 and carbon, as supported by XRD spectra (Fig. 1a). Finally, above 334 °C, the mass loss corresponds to the oxidation of carbon to CO2.

Fig. 2 shows cross-section field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of Ti3C2 films after heat treatment. As expected, after coating the Ti3C2 paste, the Ti3C2 nanosheets are horizontally aligned (Fig. S1a, ESI†). Within the resolution of our SEM, the morphology did not change after heating at 150 °C for 30 min (Fig. 2a), nor after 30 min at 250 °C (Fig. 2b), despite the fact that the peaks corresponding to TiO2 particles were seen in the XRD pattern of the latter. After treatment at 250 °C for 80 min (Fig. 2c), the morphology became a mixture of particles and 2D layers. Based on XRD and TG-DSC results, and the previous work,1 it is probably a mixture of carbon and Ti3C2 nanosheets covered with TiO2 nanoparticles. For electrodes prepared at higher temperatures, i.e., at 350 °C for 30 min (Fig. 2d), at 450 °C for 30 min and 80 min (Fig. 2e and Fig. S1b, ESI†), at 500 °C for 30 min (Fig. S1c, ESI†) and at 550 °C for 30 min (Fig. S1d, ESI†), only TiO2 nanoparticles were observed. The morphologies of these films were similar to those of the films prepared from a commercial TiO2 paste (DSL-18NR-T) shown in Fig. 2f. However, the particle sizes of TiO2 nanoparticles formed by the oxidation of Ti3C2, ranging from 20 nm to 100 nm, were larger than that of DSL-18NR-T. The particle size of TiO2 formed by Ti3C2 films treated at 450 °C for 30 min was further investigated using TEM (Fig. 2g) and compared with that of DSL-18NR-T (Fig. 2h). The particles prepared from Ti3C2 were larger and more elongated, with an average length of 60 ± 20 nm and a width of 30± 10 nm. The size of DSL-18NR-T particles was on average 21 ± 4 nm.

The performances of DSSCs as a function of heating temperature and duration time were studied. Fig. 3 shows photocurrent density vs. voltage (I–V) curves under one sun conditions and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra. Table 1 summarizes the corresponding photocurrent densities (Jsc), open-circuit voltages (Voc), fill factors (FFs), and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Both Jsc and Voc increased and thus the increase of PCE when the oxidation temperature of Ti3C2 was increased from 150 °C to 450 °C. The efficiency of the device fabricated with Ti3C2 nanosheets heated at 150 °C was zero. This was due to the absence of semiconducting TiO2 particles under these conditions. The efficiency started to increase for the sample oxidized at 250 °C and the cell performance was further improved by extending the heating time from 30 min to 80 min at a relatively lower temperature (250 °C). This is consistent with Ti3C2 oxidation, which leads to more TiO2 particle formation. However, oxidation at 450 °C for 80 min and at higher temperatures (500 °C and 550 °C) decreased the device performance from 2.66% to about 2%. This could be due to the smaller surface area of the electrodes caused by the growth of the particles.

Based on Table 1, our best electrode is formed by oxidizing Ti3C2 at 450 °C for 30 min. The device performance was further studied with various TiO2 film thicknesses under the best oxidizing conditions. The I–V characteristics are described in Table 2. The cell performance increased with film thickness up to about 6 μm, and then, decreased. For comparison, DSSCs were fabricated with commercially available TiO2 (DSL-18NR-T) particles (Table 2).

To understand the lower performance of the DSSCs using TiO2 electrodes prepared by oxidizing Ti3C2 nanosheets, charge transport and recombination kinetics were investigated, as shown in Fig. 4. The electron diffusion coefficient in the electrodes prepared from DSL-18NR-T TiO2 was about 10-fold higher than that in the film prepared from Ti3C2, while the electron lifetime in DSL-18NR-T films was more than two orders of magnitude shorter than that in the counterpart. To obtain a high charge collection efficiency, the electron diffusion length, which is the square root of the product of diffusion coefficient and lifetime, should be larger than the thickness of the TiO2 film. The results of the diffusion coefficient and lifetime measurements suggest that the electron diffusion length in the films prepared from Ti3C2 is not the reason for the low solar cell performance. Table 2 shows the decrease of Jsc values with thick electrodes. During cell preparation, these thick films were detached easily compared to thinner films. These results imply that the decreased Jsc with thick electrodes might be due to high electrical resistance in the oxidized Ti3C2 (i.e., TiO2) films and/or at the FTO/TiO2 interface. The Voc of the DSSCs prepared from Ti3C2 was about 300 mV lower than that of DSSCs prepared from DSL-18NR-T at matched electron density. Such a large difference is hardly expected due to the shift of the TiO2 conduction band edge potential. On the other hand, the plots of diffusion coefficient, lifetime and Voc in Fig. 4 can be interpreted consistently if the TiO2 films prepared from Ti3C2 have higher density of charge traps. Note that for this case, the charge traps on the TiO2 surface do not act as recombination centers but slow down the electron transport to meet acceptor species at the TiO2 surface, resulting in a longer electron lifetime. Since the traps slow down both the electron transport and recombination, the trap density does not influence the electron diffusion length. However, the traps often decrease the Fermi level of TiO2 even though the electron density in the TiO2 is increased due to slower charge recombination. Therefore, to improve the efficiency of the DSSCs, the trap density of the TiO2 films prepared from Ti3C2 should be decreased. The origin of traps has not been elucidated completely. One origin could be simple crystal defects but it seems the traps are formed more inherently due to the nano-sized structure. Thus, probably one cannot remove all the traps. A hint could be found from a general trend, that is, particles showing clear crystal facets seem to have less charge trap density for DSSCs. Along the direction, to obtain flat surface TiO2 particles/films, oxidation conditions/methods for Ti3C2 should be developed.
 Fig. 4  Relationship between electron diffusion coefficient and short-circuit current (a), open-circuit voltage and electron density (b), and electron lifetime and electron density (c) in DSSCs prepared from the oxidization of Ti3C2 and commercial TiO2. 
The amount of dyes adsorbed on the electrodes prepared from oxidized Ti3C2 at 450 °C for 30 min and DSL-18NR-T TiO2 paste annealed at 450 °C for 30 min were evaluated by measuring the absorbance of dissolved dyes in NaOH (10 mM) aqueous solution. The amount of dyes adsorbed on the films prepared from oxidized Ti3C2 and DSL-18NR-T TiO2 paste were about 1.2 × 10−4 and 1.7 × 10−4 mol cm−3, respectively. This is consistent with the larger size of the particles prepared from Ti3C2 oxidation than that of DSL-18NR-T TiO2 as shown in Fig. 2. The lower values of Jsc for Ti3C2 based DSSCs were partially due to the lower dye loading.
Another problem of the present DSSCs prepared from the nanosheets is the low fill factor. Since the porous structure was formed from nanosheets lying on the FTO substrate, one possible reason of the low FF could be due to insufficient pore channels along the vertical axis, increasing the diffusion resistance for redox couples to the Pt counter electrode. On the other hand, from different points of view, this would lead to an idea that if the nanosheets can be vertically placed on the substrate and oxidized, larger pores along the vertical axis may be formed. Such a structure is desirable for DSSCs using large-sized molecules for redox couples or using solid-state hole conductors.23,24 The pore size and TiO2 particle size may be controlled by the addition of a polymer into the paste.14,25–27 Thus, the method we demonstrated here would open possibility to control the porous structure more precisely than the conventional methods using TiO2 nanoparticles.
In summary, porous TiO2 electrodes were formed by oxidizing Ti3C2 MXene nanosheets. A paste was prepared only with water and Ti3C2 nanosheets, and the sheets were oxidized into porous films consisting of rutile and anatase TiO2 nanoparticles via simple heating in air. DSSCs were fabricated from the electrodes prepared with different heating temperatures and different thicknesses. The highest efficiency was obtained from the 6.4 μm-thick film prepared at 450 °C, but its efficiency was lower than DSSCs prepared from commercially available TiO2 nanoparticles. The lower performance was explained by the lower surface area, higher charge traps of the films, and undesired pore structure. On the other hand, no inherent problems were found, suggesting the possibility of improvement of the proposed method to produce high-performance oxide films for solar cell applications.
