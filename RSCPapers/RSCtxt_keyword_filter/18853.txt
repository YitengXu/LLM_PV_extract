    , Accepted 2nd May 2019First published on 10th May 2019AbstractIn this work, pristine carbon aerogels (CAs) were used as Pt-free counter electrodes (CEs) in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by varying the molar ratio of their precursors. Pristine mesoporous CAs with controlled resorcinol (R)/formaldehyde (F) and resorcinol (R)/sodium carbonate (C) molar ratios were successfully prepared. The as-prepared CAs were synthesized via a polymeric sol–gel reaction and were labeled as CA-O, CA-Q, CA-F, CA-C, and CA-G. The DSSCs using the as-prepared CA-C CE gave the best power conversion efficiency (PCE, η), 9.08 ± 0.01%, among all the CA CEs. The CA-C CE is further applied to an indoor T5 light source system with an impressive η value of 20.1 ± 0.60% at 2.18 mW cm−2 (T5 lamp with 7000 lux). Moreover, the hardness of CA-C CE is 3.01 GPa (Brinell hardness test), which is comparable to that of the FTO/glass substrate. As a result, the CA-C CE shows great potential to replace traditional CEs based on the Pt/FTO/glass in DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have drawn much research and development attention in recent years because of their indoor ambient applications.1–4 Light sources with T5 lamps having a photon flux less than 7000 lux are commonly used in indoor environments, such as hospitals, offices, schools and homes. Freitag et al. obtained a power-conversion efficiency (PCE, η) of 28.9% by using cosensitizers (dyes D35 and XY1) with a copper redox couple under indoor ambient lighting.4 This result encouraged researchers to explore the indoor usage of DSSCs. Tingare et al. used a TY-6 dye with an I−/I3− redox couple in DSSCs to obtain an η value of 28.56% under a T5 light source.3 These results indicated that DSSCs have the potential for use in indoor environments. A DSSC is composed of a photoanode, an electrolyte, and a counter electrode (CE), and the CE plays a role in the regeneration of the I−/I3− redox couple, which is very important for the functioning of DSSCs. Expensive metals, such as platinum (Pt), are normally coated onto transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrates (namely, Pt/FTO) for use as the CE. A variety of materials, such as conductive polymers,5–12 transition metal composites,13–20 and carbon materials,21–27 have been proposed to replace Pt in order to decrease the cost of the CEs.
Carbon aerogels (CAs) are a kind of mesoporous material with a high specific surface area, tunable pore size, low density, high porosity, good mechanical properties, high electron conductivity, and excellent electrocatalytic ability.28–43 Zhao et al. reported three kinds of carbon materials, including active carbon, carbon black, and CAs, that were deposited on a stainless steel mesh for DSSC applications.37 Even though the specific surface area of active carbon (1829 m2 g−1) is larger than that of CAs (489.5 m2 g−1), the DSSCs with CAs still achieved the best η of 9.06%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.84 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 14.63 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.70. This is attributed to the larger pore size of the CA than that of active carbon, so that the iodine/triiodide ions could pass through the channel of the CA more easily, thus increasing the DSSC performance. Ma et al. added one-dimensional (1D) single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) to the three-dimensional (3D) CAs to further enhance the performance of DSSCs due to their high porosity and surface area.44 They finally obtained SWCNT/CA CEs with an η value of 8.31%, which was better than the Pt CEs with an η value of 7.51%. Yang et al. tried to increase the number of active sites by using nitrogen-doped CA CEs and obtained an optimized η value of 8.34%.45 The above-mentioned literature shows the potential of CAs to replace Pt. Nevertheless, most CAs require metal mesh supports or substrates, such as TCO or graphite. In most cases, additional materials are needed for CAs to improve the η values of their DSSCs.
Glass coated with a TCO thin film, such as fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and indium tin oxide (ITO), is usually used as the substrate in a DSSC. However, substrates based on either FTO or ITO conductive glass possess a relatively high sheet resistance and poor adhesion to electrocatalytic materials.8,14,46–58 Over the past few years, numerous researchers have attempted to replace TCO with various substrate materials. For example, Ni foam,19,59 Ni foil,19,47 carbon cloth,45,59 PEDOT,8,50 carbon fiber,48 Pt/carbon,49 carbon nanotubes,56 Ti foil,14,46 and carbon aerogels37,45,60 have all been proposed. Zhang et al. directly used a nitrogen-doped graphene/reduced hydroxylated carbon-nanotube composite paper as the bifunctional electrode.60 The molar ratio of nitrogen-doped graphene to reduced hydroxylated carbon nanotubes was controlled to obtain optimized η, VOC, JSC, and FF values of 6.36%, 0.72 V, 13.62 mA cm−2 and 0.65, respectively, which are better than those of Pt (η, VOC, JSC, and FF values of 5.74%, 0.71 V, 12.81 mA cm−2 and 0.63, respectively). Zhao et al. and Yang et al. successfully used CAs with stainless-steel mesh supports to serve a dual role as both the TCO and electrocatalytic materials for DSSC applications with η values of 9.06% and 8.83%, respectively.37,45 Nevertheless, an additional metal mesh is still needed to support the CA structures.
In this study, for the first time, pristine mesoporous CAs with controlled resorcinol (R)/formaldehyde (F) and resorcinol (R)/sodium carbonate (C) molar ratios were successfully synthesized and served as the CEs of DSSCs in the absence of metal mesh supports, TCO substrates, and electrocatalytic materials. The CA-C sample, with R/F and R/C molar ratios of 0.76 and 377, respectively, possessed the largest specific surface area of 724 m2 g−1, leading to the best DSSC performance (η, VOC, JSC, and FF values of 9.08 ± 0.01%, 0.77 ± 0.01 V, 16.59 ± 0.08 mA cm−2 and 0.71 ± 0.00, respectively) under one sun, which is the highest DSSC efficiency compared to the previous literature. As shown in Scheme 1, the low-cost, light-weight and pristine CAs can serve as a DSSC CE in the absence of a metal mesh support, TCO substrate, and electrocatalytic materials, thus offering the possibility for industrial application.

Lithium iodide (LiI, synthetic grade), iodine (I2, synthetic grade), and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG, MW ∼ 20000) were obtained from Merck. cis-Diisothiocyanato bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato) ruthenium(II) bis(tetrabutylammonium) (N719 dye), transparent TiO2 paste (TL paste, Ti-nanoxide HT/SP, with an average particle size of 13 nm), and Surlyn® (SX1170-60, 60 μm) were acquired from Solaronix (S.A., Aubonne, Switzerland). 1,2-Dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII) was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. Acetonitrile (ACN, 99.99%) and nitric acid (HNO3, ca. 65% solution in water) were purchased from J. T. Baker. Acetone (99%), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 96%), guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN, ≥99%), and tert-butyl alcohol (tBA, 96%) were obtained from Acros. 3-Methoxypropionitrile (MPN, 99%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Commercial light-scattering TiO2 particles (ST-41) with an average particle size of 200 nm were acquired from Ishihara Sangyo, Ltd.
2.2. Fabrication of the counter electrodes
An aqueous solution containing 1.0 M resorcinol (R) and 1.32 × 10−3 M sodium carbonate (C) was mixed in H2O and stirred for 5 min. Then, the aqueous solution was mixed with 1.32 M formaldehyde (F) at 25 °C and stirred for 1 h. For the subsequent hydrolysis and condensation reactions, the solution was kept at 45 °C for the first day and maintained at 75 °C for the second day. By this time, the cross-linking process had finished, and a gel was formed. The gel was immersed in ethanol for five days, with replacement of the ethanol each day, to remove the residual solvent in the gel. The gel was then kept at 25 °C for 7 days to remove ethanol. Finally, the carbon aerogel was obtained by carbonization at 1000 °C for 6 h. The carbon aerogel structures were controlled by varying the R/F and R/C molar ratios, and are labeled as CA-O, CA-Q, CA-F, CA-C, and CA-G, as outlined in Table 1.

2.3. Cell assembly
A TiO2 film was used as the photoanode, which consisted of a compact layer, a transparent layer, and a scattering layer. The compact layer (with a thickness of approximately 100 nm) was spin-coated onto a clean FTO substrate using a precursor solution of TTIP and 2-methoxyethanol (weight ratio of 1:3). The transparent layer (with a thickness of approximately 10 μm) was coated onto the compact layer by a doctor blade technique using the above-mentioned commercially available transparent paste (Ti-nanoxide HT/SP). The scattering layer (with a thickness of approximately 4 μm) was coated onto the transparent layer by the same doctor blade technique using a homemade scattering paste, whose preparation is described in detail below. Each TiO2 layer was sintered at 500 °C for 30 min in an ambient environment. The sintered TiO2 film (with an active area of 0.20 cm2) was immersed in a solution of 5 × 10−4 M N719 dye with ACN and tBA (volume ratio of 1:1) as the solvent at room temperature for 24 h. The DSSC was composed of a N719-adsorbed TiO2 photoanode coupled to a CE and an electrolyte. The gap between these two electrodes was fixed and sealed by heating a 60 μm-thick Surlyn®. The electrolyte, which contained 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M DMPII, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M tBP in MPN/ACN (volume ratio of 1:1), was injected into the gap between these two electrodes by capillarity. The above-mentioned scattering paste was made in the lab by a four-step process, as follows: (1) a 0.5 M TTIP solution was added to a 0.1 M aqueous nitric acid solution with constant stirring; this solution was heated to 88 °C and maintained at this temperature for 8 h. (2) The solution was cooled to room temperature, transferred to an autoclave (PARR 4540, USA), gently heated to 240 °C, and kept at this temperature for 12 h; at this stage, the TiO2 nanoparticles attained an average diameter of 20 nm. (3) The autoclaved TiO2 colloid was then concentrated to be 8 wt% of TiO2 nanoparticles. (4) The scattering layer paste (SL paste) was obtained by the addition of 25 wt% PEG and 100 wt% ST-41 (with respect to the weight of TiO2) to the concentrated-TiO2 colloid.
2.4. Analysis
The surface morphologies of the various carbon aerogels were observed using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, Nova NanoSEM 230, FEI, Oregon, USA) coupled with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDX, model 7021-H, Horiba). The specific surface area and pore size distribution of the as-prepared CAs were analyzed by N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms according to the Brunauer, Emmett and Teller theory (BET, Micromeritics ASAP 2020). The hardness of the as-synthesized CAs was measured using a nanomechanical test instrument (Bruker TI-950). Photovoltaic parameters and the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of DSSCs with different CEs were recorded using a potentiostat/galvanostat (PGSTAT 30, Autolab Eco-Chemie, Utrecht, the Netherlands). The cell conversion efficiency of a DSSC was obtained under a light illumination of 100 mW cm−2 using a class-A solar simulator (XES-301S, AM1.5G, San-Ei Electric Co. Ltd, Osaka, Japan). The incident light intensity was calibrated with a standard Si cell (PECSI01, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan). The IPCE curves of the DSSCs were obtained in the wavelength range of 400 to 800 nm by another class-A solar simulator (PEC-L11, AM1.5G, Peccell Technologies, Inc., Kanagawa, Japan) equipped with a monochromator (model 74100, Oriel Instrument, California, USA). The incident radiation flux (φ) was measured via an optical detector (model 818-SL, Newport, California, USA) and a power meter (model 1916-R, Newport, California, USA).
The electrocatalytic properties of a film were quantified by cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis. Cyclic voltammetry was performed in a three-electrode electrochemical system containing 10.0 mM LiI, 1.0 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 in ACN using the above-mentioned potentiostat/galvanostat. The electrodes of Pt/FTO/glass, CA-O, CA-Q, CA-F, CA-C, and CA-G were used as the working electrodes, and Pt foil and an Ag/Ag+ electrode were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A scan rate of 100 mV s−1 was applied.
The electrochemical properties of the CEs were also quantified by Tafel polarization curves (Tafel plots) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS); a symmetric cell, consisting of the same film on both the anode and cathode, was used for these purposes. The electrodes of Pt/FTO/glass, CA-O, CA-Q, CA-F, CA-C, and CA-G were individually used to form their symmetric cells. The data were recorded using the above-mentioned potentiostat/galvanostat equipped with an FRA2 module; the electrolyte consisted of 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M DMPII, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M tBP in MPN/ACN (volume ratio of 1:1). A scan rate of 50 mV s−1 was used for Tafel analysis. Under open-circuit conditions, the EIS analysis was performed between 10 mHz and 65 kHz with an AC amplitude of ±10 mV.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. FE-SEM analysis
The pristine CAs, including CA-O, CA-Q, CA-F, CA-C, and CA-G, were classified into two groups. The first group, containing CA-O, CA-Q, and CA-F, had a fixed R/C molar ratio of 755 but had different R/F molar ratios of 0.76, 0.5, and 0.38, respectively. The second group, containing CA-O, CA-C, and CA-G, had a fixed R/F molar ratio of 0.76 but possessed different R/C molar ratios of 755, 377, and 251, respectively. The morphologies of the pristine CAs were first studied by FE-SEM, as shown in Fig. 1. The particle sizes of the CAs decreased from approximately 100 nm (CA-O, R/F = 0.76 and CA-Q, R/F = 0.50) to 60 nm (CA-F, R/F = 0.38) with the decreasing R/F ratios, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1(a)–(c). Accordingly, as seen in Scheme 2(a), resorcinol (R) is deprotonated to form a R− anion in a weak alkali sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) environment. As for the condensation reaction, the R− anion would react with formaldehyde (F) to form hydroxymethyl derivatives (–CH2OH). The as-synthesized hydroxymethyl derivatives tend to condense with each other to form methylene (–CH2–)- and methylene ether (–CH2OCH2–)-bridged compounds, thus leading to the formation of quasi carbon aerogels. R is the limiting reagent in the low R/F ratios, leading to the formation of smaller RF cross-linked clusters in the polymeric sol–gel reactions. As a result, the CA-F sample with the lowest R/F molar ratio possesses a smaller particle size of approximately 60 nm, as shown in Fig. 1(c) and Scheme 2(b). Furthermore, as the R/C molar ratio decreased from 755 (CA-O) to 377 (CA-C), the particle size also decreased from ca. 100 nm (CA-O) to 50 nm (CA-C). Low R/C molar ratios result in the formation of polymeric RF gel structures rather than colloidal RF gel structures.61,62 Polymeric RF carbon aerogels are commonly associated with small particle sizes and high surface areas. As a result, CA-C, having a low R/C molar ratio and polymeric RF gel structures, has the smallest particle size of approximately 50 nm, as seen in Fig. 1(d). However, aggregation of the particles is observed for the CA-G sample shown in Fig. 1(e), which has a quite low R/C molar ratio of 251. This is because the C (sodium carbonate Na2CO3) creates a weak alkali environment, which would form a large amount of R− anion, as shown in Scheme 2(a). Since the reactivity of the R− anion and F is higher than that of the un-deprotonated R and F, the former is beneficial for the growth of quasi carbon structures, thus leading to the occurrence of agglomeration. Consequently, the R/C molar ratio of 377 (CA-C sample) is the optimal value for preparing the polymeric RF carbon aerogels used in this study.

3.2. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller analysis
The specific surface areas and pore-size distributions of the pristine CAs were further investigated using nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms, as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. Fig. 2(a) shows the curves of type-IV N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms for all of the CA samples, and indicates that all of the CA samples are mesoporous, which is consistent with the pore-size distribution results (Fig. 2(b)). The specific surface areas of the CA-O and CA-F samples increased slightly from 592 to 643 m2 g−1 with decreasing R/F molar ratios from 0.76 to 0.38. The smaller particle sizes of the CA-F sample, with a low R/F molar ratio of 0.38 (Fig. 1(c)), result in the formation of high specific surface areas. Furthermore, the largest specific surface area, of approximately 724 m2 g−1, was observed in the CA-C sample, where the R/C molar ratio decreased from 755 (CA-O) to 377 (CA-C). The CA-C sample, with a low R/C molar ratio of 377, possesses a polymeric RF gel structure instead of a colloidal gel structure, resulting in the formation of mesoporous CAs with smaller particle sizes and larger specific surface areas. However, when the R/C molar ratio was further decreased to 251 for the CA-G sample, the specific surface area did not increase but rather decreased to 577 m2 g−1. As seen in the FE-SEM image in Fig. 1(e), particle aggregation is observed for the CA-G sample, leading to a decrease in the specific surface areas. The performance of DSSCs using pristine CA-C CEs, as well as the CA-O, CA-Q, CA-F, CA-C and CA-G CEs, will be discussed in the next section.

3.3. Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performance of the as-prepared CA CEs is presented in Fig. 3, and the results are summarized in Table 2. The effect of the CA CEs of various R/F (CA-O, CA-Q, and CA-F CEs) and R/C (CA-O, CA-G, and CA-C CEs) molar ratios on the photovoltaic performance is discussed in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs using the CA-O, CA-Q, and CA-F CEs are shown in Fig. 3(a), and those using the CA-O, CA-C, and CA-G CEs are shown in Fig. 3(b). The power-conversion efficiencies (η) and short-circuit current densities (JSC) of the CA CEs with various R/F molar ratios are enhanced with a decrease in the R/F molar ratios, as shown for the CA-O, CA-Q, and CA-F CEs in Table 2. The higher specific surface areas of the CA CEs benefitted the electrocatalytic abilities of the CA CEs, leading to an increase in the JSC value. As a result, the CA-F CE, with the largest specific surface area of 643 m2 g−1, has the highest η value of 8.52 ± 0.02% among the CA-O, CA-Q and CA-F CEs, which have various R/F molar ratios. However, among the CA-O, CA-G, and CA-C CEs, which have various R/C molar ratios, the CA-C CE, with a lower R/C molar ratio of 377, has the highest η value of 9.08 ± 0.01% and the largest JSC value of 16.59 ± 0.08 mA cm−2 owing to having the largest specific surface area of 724 m2 g−1. When the R/C molar ratio was further decreased to 251 for the CA-G CE, the specific surface area decreased due to particle aggregation, as mentioned before, resulting in a decrease in the η and JSC values. To investigate the potential of the CA-F and CA-C CEs to replace the conventional Pt/FTO/glass CE, the J–V curves of the DSSCs with the counter electrodes of Pt/FTO/glass, CA-O, CA-F, and CA-C are shown in Fig. 4(a). The DSSC using the Pt/FTO/glass CE exhibits an η value of 7.92 ± 0.11% with a VOC of 0.74 ± 0.00 V, JSC of 15.98 ± 0.22 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.67 ± 0.00. The CA-O, CA-F, and CA-C CEs have better η than the Pt/FTO CE. The trend of the JSC value related to the electrocatalytic ability is CA-O < CA-F < Pt/FTO/glass < CA-C. The results reveal that the CA-C CE has better electrocatalytic abilities than the Pt/FTO/glass CE. Both the intrinsic and extrinsic properties of the CE materials affect their electrocatalytic ability. The intrinsic property of the electrocatalytic ability when using common carbon CEs is quite low compared to those of Pt/FTO/glass CEs. As a result, the extrinsic property of the electrocatalytic ability of CE materials, which means the value of the specific surface area, plays an important role in DSSCs. The higher specific surface areas of the CEs provide sufficient sites to promote the electrocatalytic reaction, resulting in an enhancement of the electrocatalytic ability of the CEs. The excellent extrinsic property of the electrocatalytic ability of the CA-C CEs results from the large specific surface area of 724 m2 g−1. As a result, pristine CA-C CEs have great potential to replace Pt/FTO/glass CEs. Moreover, with the aim of investigating the possibility of CA-F and CA-C CEs to replace conventional Pt/FTO/glass CEs, the mechanical strength of Pt/FTO/glass, CA-F, and CA-C substrates was measured by the Brinell hardness test. The hardness of the Pt/FTO/glass, CA-F, and CA-C substrates is 5.88, 5.56, and 3.01 GPa, respectively, as shown in Fig. S1 and Table S1.† The mechanical strengths of the CA-F and CA-C CEs are comparable to that of the Pt/FTO/glass CE, implying the possibility of replacing conventional Pt/FTO/glass CEs. As a result, pristine CA-F and CA-C mesoporous materials have great potential to replace conventional Pt/FTO/glass CEs.

The performances of cells with Pt/FTO/glass, CA-O, CA-F, and CA-C CEs are investigated using their incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The short-circuit photocurrent densities (JSC–IPCE) of the DSSCs with Pt, CA-O, CA-F, and CA-C CEs are 12.78, 11.03, 12.08, and 13.04 mA cm−2, respectively. The trend in the JSC–IPCE values is CA-O < CA-F < Pt/FTO/glass < CA-C, which is consistent with the trend of JSC values obtained from the J–V curves. Consequently, the as-prepared low-cost CA-C mesoporous materials have great potential to serve the dual roles of a CE and substrate and to replace the expensive Pt/FTO/glass CEs in DSSCs.
3.4. Cyclic voltammetry
The electrocatalytic ability of a CE plays a significant role in DSSC efficiency. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) performed in an electrolyte containing the I−/I3− redox couple is used to precisely evaluate the electrocatalytic ability of a CE toward the reduction of I3− to I− in a DSSC by measuring the cathodic peak-current density (Jpc). The parameters measured by CV refer to the overall electrocatalytic ability of the reduction capability of a CE. Fig. 4(c) shows the CV curves using Pt/FTO/glass, CA-O, CA-F, and CA-C electrodes, and Table 3 gives their Jpc values. The Jpc values for the Pt/FTO/glass, CA-O, CA-F, and CA-C electrodes are 1.34, 1.05, 1.22 and 1.40 mA cm−2, respectively (Table 3). The trend in the measured JPC values (CA-O < CA-F < Pt/FTO/glass < CA-C) is also in good agreement with the trend of the corresponding JSC values mentioned above. Obviously, the Jpc value of the CA-C CE (1.40 mA cm−2) is higher than the Jpc value of the Pt/FTO/glass CE (1.34 mA cm−2), indicating a better electrocatalytic activity for the CA-C CE than that of the Pt/FTO/glass CE. This is attributed to the better extrinsic property of the electrocatalytic ability for the as-synthesized CA-C CE, with a large specific surface area of 724 m2 g−1, than that for the Pt/FTO/glass CE, which is favorable for enhancing the Jpc values of the CA mesoporous materials. The CA-C CE shows convincing stability up to 1000 CV cycles. At the 1000th cycle, the CA-C CE still maintains 95% of its initial electrocatalytic ability (Fig. S2†).

3.5. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Tafel polarization curves, four-point probes, and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were employed to investigate the interfacial resistances of the DSSC systems. Tafel polarization curves using Pt/FTO/glass, CA-O, CA-F, and CA-C CEs are presented in Fig. 5(a), and these plots of the logarithmic current density (logJ) versus voltage (V) were obtained using a symmetric cell composed of both the anode and cathode. A Tafel polarization curve can be divided into three zones: the first zone at |V| < 120 mV represents the polarization zone, the second zone at 120 mV < |V| < 400 mV (with a sharp slope) is the Tafel zone and the third zone at |V| > 400 mV (horizontal part) is the diffusion zone. The exchange current density (J0) of an electrocatalytic composite film can be obtained by extrapolating the cathodic and anodic curves and reading the cross point at 0 V in the Tafel zone. The J0 value of an electrocatalytic film can be further used to calculate the charge transfer resistance (Rct-Tafel) corresponding to the film/electrolyte interface using the following eqn (1):13 (1)where R is the ideal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, n is the number of electrons transferred for I3− reduction, and F is the Faraday constant. Generally, a better electrocatalytic film has a lower Rct-Tafel value, which reflects a large amount of electrons transferring through the electrocatalytic electrode/electrolyte interface. The Rct-Tafel values of the CA-O, CA-F and CA-C CEs are all lower than that of the Pt/FTO/glass CE (4.38 Ω cm2), indicating a better electrocatalytic ability for the CA CEs than for the Pt/FTO/glass CE, as shown in Table 3. Furthermore, the lowest Rct-Tafel value of 3.18 Ω cm2 was observed for the CA-C CE, indicating that many electrons were transferred through the electrocatalytic electrode/electrolyte interface to promote its electrocatalytic ability.
 Fig. 5  (a) Tafel polarization plots and (b) EIS spectra of Pt/FTO/glass, CA-O (R/C = 755 and R/F = 0.76), CA-F (R/C = 755 and R/F = 0.38), and CA-C (R/C = 377 and R/F = 0.76). 
The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) are also used to obtain the ohmic series resistance (RS) and the charge-transfer resistance (Rct-EIS). The ohmic series resistance (RS), which is the resistance between the substrate and catalytic layer, is the onset point of the first semicircle in the high-frequency region. The charge-transfer resistance (Rct-EIS), which is the resistance of the electrocatalytic electrode/electrolyte interface, is the radius of the first semicircle in the middle-frequency region. The EIS spectra using the Pt/FTO/glass, CA-O, CA-F, and CA-C CEs are shown in Fig. 5(b). The Rct-EIS values of the Pt/FTO/glass, CA-O, CA-F, and CA-C CEs are estimated to be 4.28, 4.30, 4.08, and 3.96 Ω cm2, respectively. The lowest Rct-EIS value being for the CA-C CE further verifies that the CA-C CE has the best electrocatalytic ability compared with the Pt/FTO/glass, CA-O and CA-F CEs. The RS values of the Pt, CA-O, CA-F, and CA-C CEs are 19.46, 15.4, 13.40, and 11.06 Ω cm2, respectively. All of the CAs have lower RS values than the Pt/FTO/glass CE due to their 3-D network and continuous structures. Furthermore, the sheet resistance (Rsh) is used to evaluate the electrode resistance by a four-point probe measurement. The Rsh values of the Pt/FTO/glass, CA-O, CA-F, and CA-C CEs are 6.71, 0.23, 0.14, and 0.05 Ω sq−1, respectively. The trend in the Rsh values is the same as the trend in the Rs values. The Rsh value of the Pt/FTO/glass CE is much higher than that of the other CA CEs due to the addition of the FTO substrate resistance and the interfacial resistance between the Pt layer and FTO substrate. Even if the Pt layer has a very low resistance, the FTO substrate, which has a high resistance, is the dominant resistance of a Pt/FTO/glass CE. These results indicate that a CA CE could replace conventional Pt/FTO/glass CEs. Moreover, the CA CE successfully decreases the interfacial resistance between the electrocatalytic film and TCO substrate, thus enhancing the DSSC efficiency.
3.6. Dim light
To investigate the efficacy of the best DSSC under dim-light conditions, the J–V curves of the DSSCs using the CA-C CE are shown in Fig. 6 under a light irradiance of 1.0 sun (100 mW cm−2) and 0.5 sun (50 mW cm−2). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters under different light irradiances are summarized in Table 4. The DSSC using the CA-C CE exhibits an η value of 9.08 ± 0.01% under the light irradiance of 1.0 sun and a slightly higher η value of 9.16 ± 0.68% under the light irradiance of 0.5 sun. The FF value increases because less I3− ions need to be reduced under dim light conditions. The T5 lamp is a common indoor lighting lamp and is also used with the DSSC system in this work. The DSSC with the CA-C CE has an impressive η value of 20.1 ± 0.60% under a T5 lamp with 7000 lux (2.18 mW cm−2), which is the best performance among the different light irradiances of 100, 50, and 2.18 mW cm−2.

4. Conclusions
Mesoporous pristine CA materials were successfully synthesized using a polymeric sol–gel reaction with different molar ratios of resorcinol, sodium carbonate and formaldehyde precursors. The CA-C sample, with R/F and R/C molar ratios of 0.76 and 377, possessed the largest specific surface area of 724 m2 g−1, resulting in the best DSSC performance (η and JSC of 9.08 ± 0.01% and 16.59 ± 0.08 mA cm−2) under 1 sun. Additionally, the results of the IPCE, CV, EIS, and Tafel measurements verify that the CA-C CE possesses good electrocatalytic ability. In four-point probe measurements, the Rsh (0.05 Ω sq−1) of the CA-C CE is lower than the Rsh (6.71 Ω sq−1) of the Pt/FTO/glass CE. Furthermore, the CA-C CE has a hardness of 3.01 GPa, which is comparable to that of the Pt/FTO/glass CE (5.25 GPa). In a dim-light environment, the DSSC using the CA-C CE exhibits an η value of 9.08 ± 0.01% at the irradiation-energy flux of 1.0 sun, a slightly higher η value of 9.16 ± 0.68% at the irradiation-energy flux of 0.5 sun and the best η value of 20.1 ± 0.60% at 2.18 mW cm−2 (T5 lamp with 7000 lux). These results support the theory that low-cost and metal-free CA-C CEs are a promising electrocatalytic material to replace the expensive Pt/FTO/glass CEs in DSSCs.
