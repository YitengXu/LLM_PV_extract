    , Accepted 20th February 2023First published on 21st February 2023AbstractThe emergence of all-inorganic antimony (Sb)-based perovskite-inspired solar cells (PISCs) has attracted much attention due to their good stability and non-toxicity compared with lead (Pb)-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, it is still a great challenge to develop a simple, highly repeatable, and anti-solvent-free strategy to obtain high-quality all-inorganic Sb-based perovskite-inspired films due to their quick formation and anisotropic growth. Herein, the precursor solution is supplemented with dimethylammonium iodide (DMAI) as a novel and low-cost additive to help control the nucleation and growth process. The volatile DMAI additive could significantly boost the formation of a mix-oriented intermediate 0D phase, leading to smooth and compact Sb-based perovskite-inspired films with low defect concentration and optimized crystal orientation. Additionally, the interface diffusion brought on by rubidium chloride (RbCl) treatment could effectively suppress the low-dimension impurity phase and promote a better band alignment. As a reward, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the champion device can reach 3.37% with a superior open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.93 V, which is the record PCE value for Sb-based PISCs hitherto. This work will provide a fresh and inspiring way to realize highly efficient lead-free PISCs.
Introduction
Although remarkable progress has been achieved for organic-inorganic Pb halide PSCs, with a record PCE of 25.6%, the toxicity and thermal instability caused by Pb and organic components continue to impede their mass commercialization.1–3 Even worse, Li et al. reported that Pb leaking from decomposed Pb-based PSCs can be easily absorbed by plants and enter the food cycle, resulting in serious biological pollution.4 Substantial efforts have been made to investigate high-quality alternative Pb-free perovskite compositions for photovoltaic (PV) application.5–7 Due to the similar electronic dimensionality and electronic features of tin (Sn) and Pb, Sn-based perovskite compositions have attracted much attention as candidates for highly efficient Pb-free PSCs.8–10 Recently, Zhu et al. reported a high-quality FASnI3 PSC with a certified efficiency of 14% by meticulously regulating the FASnI3 film quality.11 To address the thermal stability issue, inorganic cesium (Cs) ions were used to replace organic cations, and inorganic CsSnI3 PSCs with a recorded PCE of more than 10% were fabricated.12 However, photoactive CsSnI3 is extremely unstable in an air environment.13,14 This behavior is correlated with the rapid oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+ in CsSnI3 films when directly exposed to oxygen. Cs3Sb2X9 (X = I, Br, Cl) type perovskite-inspired compounds are another promising alternative to inorganic Pb-free perovskites.15–17 Due to the different positions of the octahedron, Sb-based perovskite-inspired compounds can have either a zero-dimensional (0D) dimer or a two-dimensional (2D) layered structure, while the 2D layered structure has a smaller optical band gap and higher carrier mobility.18 Unfortunately, Cs3Sb2I9 films prepared by the solution method have a 0D dimer structure, which is detrimental to their photovoltaic properties. As a result, intensive efforts have been made to improve the PCE of Cs3Sb2I9 PISCs by exquisitely regulating the dimensionality of Cs3Sb2I9 films. Umar et al., for example, obtained 2D Cs3Sb2I9 films by adding hydrochloric acid to the precursor solution and achieved a champion PCE of 1.21%.19 Paul et al. discovered that a small amount of Cl doping could effectively improve the film dimension and a PCE of over 2% can be achieved for PISCs with a Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x absorber layer.20
Aside from the film dimensionality, the morphology, crystallinity, and coverage of the light-absorbing layer film also play crucial roles in final device performance. The solution-based spin-coating method is currently a simple and successful synthesis protocol for preparing high-quality Pb-based inorganic perovskite films, and a mixed precursor solvent (DMF/DMSO) was typically used to regulate the crystallization process. For example, CsI·PbX2·DMSO intermediate engineering could be used during the preparation process to slow down the crystallization rate, leading to a compact precursor film.21 Unlike Pb-based perovskites, Sb-based inorganic perovskite-inspired films have a much faster formation rate due to the lower activation energy, making it difficult to achieve a compact film morphology regardless of whether a mixed solvent was used.22,23 Given the successful experience in the synthesis of Pb-based perovskite films, the anti-solvent assisted method was naturally adopted to promote the homogenous nucleation process and obtain relatively smooth Sb-based inorganic perovskite-inspired films with fewer voids.23 However, the processing window of the anti-solvent assisted method is very narrow due to the complex extrinsic factors (moisture, thermodynamics, type of anti-solvents and so on), which could greatly increase the complexity of the large-scale fabrication process.24–26 In addition to the anti-solvent assisted method, coordination molecules have been widely used in Pb-based perovskites to mediate the phase transition from 2D to 3D perovskite films and then reduce the growth rate by forming an intermediate phase.27,28 For instance, Yang et al. used (trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium (LiTFSI) as an additive to acquire high-quality 2D layered MA3Sb2I9−xClx films by forming the MAI–SbCl3–LiTFSI intermediate phase. However, the anti-solvent (N-butyl acetate) was still required, and LiTFSI is extremely sensitive to moisture, which would increase the cost and instability in the preparation process.29 Besides, reports on the growth dynamics of inorganic Sb-based inorganic perovskite-inspired films are still scarce. Therefore, a more universal and simple route to produce high-quality Sb-based perovskite-inspired films with a 2D layer structure should be pursued after precisely investigating and controlling thin film growth dynamics.
In this work, we present a facile and anti-solvent-free deposition method for producing high-quality Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films by incorporating a small amount of DMAI into the precursor solution to alter the thin film growth process. To fully comprehend the effects of DMAI additive on final device performance, the chemical composition and phase evolution of the mixed DMAI/Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x intermediate layer during thermal annealing have been carefully studied. The incorporation of DMAI has been found to significantly affect the crystallization process of the 0D intermediate phase and manipulate the surface coverage of the precursor film by promoting the nucleation process. Finally, Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films with compact surface morphology, good interface contact and low defect concentration can be obtained. Moreover, buried RbCl interface modification was further used to fine-tune interfacial energy level alignment and suppress the 0D impurity phase in the absorber layer film. Low-cost carbon-based planar PISCs were assembled to evaluate the conversion efficiency of Sb-based perovskite-inspired films. As a result, a relatively high efficiency of 3.37% with a high Voc of 0.93 V can be achieved, which is the record value for Sb-based PISCs to the best of our knowledge.
Results and discussion
Raw Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films were fabricated by spinning the precursors comprised of different xDMAI/CsI (x = 0, 0.75) ratios and then annealing at 250 °C under a SbI3 vapor atmosphere to examine the impact of DMAI additive on film growth dynamics. Fig. 1a and b display the GIXRD patterns and SEM images of corresponding Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films. As shown in Fig. 1a, the XRD pattern for unannealed Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films without DMAI additive matches well with the data of PDF# 88-0689 (0D phase, space group P63/mmc) with (006) preferential orientation. Simultaneously, uncompacted surface morphology with hexagonal nanoplates can be observed for unannealed films which can be due to their preferred c-axis oriented growth with an orthorhombic structure.30 After annealing at 250 °C for 10 min under a SbI3 vapor atmosphere, the pristine Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x film shows an obvious phase transition from 0D to 2D. The preferential plane orientation can be indexed to the 2D layer Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x from the data of PDF# 88-0690 (space group Pm1, no. 164). Although the crystallinity and proportion of the 2D layer phase have been significantly improved, large surface voids and 0D dimer phase peaks can still be found in the annealed Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x film. Besides, a highly intense (003) preferred orientation peak can be observed, which will lead to charge transport anisotropy and is not conducive to the final device performance.31 In contrast, the unannealed film with DMAI additive shows a mixed preferential plane orientation of (006)/(202), and a relatively smooth surface morphology with small uniform particles can be observed. Recently, DMA ion additive engineering has become a very successful strategy for achieving photoactive DMAxCs1−xPbI3 films by forming DMAPbI3 and Cs4PbI6 transitive phases before the high-temperature annealing process.32–34 A high efficiency of over 15% could be achieved for carbon-based DMAxCs1−xPbI3 solar cells by rigorous composition manipulation.35 Therefore, DMA3Sb2ClxI9−x films were also prepared with a DMA/Cs ratio of 1:0 to demonstrate whether the same mechanism can be applied to Pb-free perovskite-inspired materials. As seen in the corresponding XRD patterns of Fig. S1,† no peaks in the unannealed film can be indexed to the DMA3Sb2ClxI9−x phase, denoting that a DMAI·Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x 0D intermediate phase may exist in the unannealed film instead of the DMA3Sb2ClxI9−x/Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x two-layered phase. Once the SbI3 vapor annealing process was executed, the proportion of the 0D layer phase can be effectively suppressed and a more randomly oriented crystalline structure with compact surface morphology can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 1a and b. The XRD and SEM evolution denote that DMAI addition plays an important role in accelerating the nucleation growth process of Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films during the spinning procedure by producing a certain amount of nucleation sites. The UV-vis spectra also confirm this explanation. As seen in Fig. 1c, the unannealed 0.75DMAI:CsI film shows an obvious absorption edge at circa 520 nm, which is not assigned to the absorption edge of DMA3Sb2ClxI9−x (Fig. S2†). The same absorption edge can also be observed for the sample without DMAI additive and a band gap of 2.39 eV can be calculated from the Tauc plot of absorbance data, which is very close to the value of 0D dimer phase Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x.36 As seen in the inset of Fig. 1b, the color of the film changes from orange to red after annealing at 250 °C and the intensity of the absorbance peak around 520 nm substantially decreases, whereas a new absorbance edge around 600 nm arises (Fig. 1d). A direct band gap around 2.07 eV can be calculated for the annealed film, which coincides with the band gap of the 2D layer Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x film.37 In addition, an improved PL intensity can be found for the Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x film with DMAI additive, suggesting a better film quality and decreased carrier recombination centers (Fig. S3†). The TRPL spectra were also recorded (Fig. 1e) to study the carrier recombination dynamics in Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films with/without DMAI addition, and the corresponding carrier lifetime can be fitted according to the following equation:  where A1 and A2 represent the amplitudes, and τ1 and τ2 are the faster/slower decay time.38 Detailed decay time fitting results are listed in Table S2† and the average lifetime (τave) can be calculated using the following equation τave = ∑Aiτi/∑Ai. A reduced τave from to 3.24 to 10.06 ns can be observed for Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films with DMAI additive, demonstrating reduced recombination probability and improved film quality with more compact surface morphology.39–41 The effect of DMAI addition ratio on the film crystallinity and morphology was also studied by adjusting the DMAI/CsI molar ratio in the precursor solution to 0.25:1, 0.5:1 and 1:1. As seen in Fig. 1f, a remarkable change can be observed in the morphology of Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films with slightly varied XRD patterns when different amounts of DMAI were involved in the precursor solution. The intensity of the prominent 0D dimer-phase peak at 27.7° can be significantly repressed with increasing DMAI doping concentrations. However, compared to Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films prepared with a DMAI/CsI ratio of 0.75:1, the smaller full width half maximum (FWHM) of the preferential orientation for the film with a DMAI/CsI ratio of 1:1 suggests a poorer crystallization quality, along with smaller grain size and surface pinholes. The phenomenon can be explained by the undesirable nucleation concentration caused by extra DMAI addition, which may deteriorate surface coverage. SEM images of Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films with different DMAI concentrations are shown in Fig. S4.† With increasing the DMAI/CsI ratio from 0.25:1 to 0.75:1, uneven surfaces with fewer pinholes can be observed. However, when the DMAI/CsI ratio is 1:1, much smaller size grains with clear pinholes can be observed in the film surface, which is in accordance with XRD results.

To deeply understand the role of DMAI additive in regulating the growth process of Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films, temperature-related growth dynamics of the film prepared with a DMAI/CsI ratio of 0.75:1 has also been systematically investigated and shown in Fig. 2. As seen in Fig. 2a, the apparent 0D–2D structure conversion occurs at 150 °C when the preferential (006)/(202) peaks apace disappear. The UV-vis spectra in Fig. 2b also support this phenomenon with the distinct absorption onset around 600 nm arising at 150 °C. When further increasing the annealing temperature from 150 °C to 250 °C, the intensity of the diffraction peak of the 2D phase becomes more intense accompanied by the increased optic absorbance, which could favor its photo-electrical conversion performance. Temperature-related XPS spectra of Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films were measured to explore the effect of DMAI additive on the composition and electronic state of Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films. Fig. 2c–e give the XPS peaks of Cs, Sb 3d and N 1 s core levels, respectively. The peak positions of Cs and Sb 3d show a slight shift to a higher binding energy area when annealing at 150 °C, which corresponds to the dominant-phase change temperature. Moreover, obvious XPS peaks for N ions can be observed for films annealed below 200 °C, which can be due to the DMAI additive. The ToF-SIMS depth profile measurement (Fig. 2f) also confirms the existence and uniform distribution of N ions for the film annealed at 150 °C. When the annealing temperature rises to 200 °C, the N ion signal disappears thoroughly. Therefore, DMAI is proven to be a volatile additive instead of an A-site dopant in the final Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x film.

To evaluate the optical-electric conversion ability of films prepared with or without DMAI additive, all Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films are assembled into low-cost carbon-based PISCs with an n–i–p configuration of FTO/Nb2O5/Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x/P3HT/carbon (Fig. 3a). Fig. 3b, c and Table 1 show the champion J–V curves and statistical data of the photovoltaic performance characteristics for devices with DMAI/CsI ratios varying from 0:1 to 1:1. It can be noted that the increase of DMAI additive results in the comprehensive improvement of device performance. The PISC without DMAI additive shows a poor device performance with a champion PCE of 0.35%, Voc of 0.76 V, Jsc of 1.17 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.39. While breakthroughs can be observed for the performance of PISCs with increased DMAI additive, the champion device with a DMAI/CsI ratio of 0.75:1 yields a high PCE of 2.74%, with a significantly improved Voc of 0.89 V, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 5.21 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 0.59. For the sake of accuracy, the current density of the champion PISC was also measured with the maximum power point voltage forward bias (Fig. 3d). A stable output PCE of 2.7% was obtained, which accords with the value of J–V measurement well. The advantageous performance of the PISC with DMAI additive over the one without DMAI additive can partially originate from the improved physical properties, such as optimized crystal orientation, decreased 0D phase ratio and improved film quality, which have been confirmed by XRD and SEM results. When the DMAI/CsI ratio further increases from 0.75:1 to 1:1, all device parameters exhibit a slight decrease, which agrees with the experimental outcome of worsened film surface coverage and crystalline quality.

EIS measurements were also conducted to evaluate the carrier transport and recombination process in PISCs with/without DMAI additive. Fig. S5† exhibits the Nyquist plots and equivalent circuit for corresponding devices. The fitting contact resistance (Rs) and recombination resistance (Rrec) values were calculated and are listed in Table S2.† The PISC with DMAI additive shows a much larger Rrec than the reference one, which suggests a depressed carries recombination probability.42 The IPCE spectra of the champion PSLCs with/without DMAI additive were also recorded and are shown in Fig. S6.† A significantly higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) with calculated Jsc can be observed for the PISC with DMAI additive, which matches well with its J–V characteristics. To study the effect of DMAI-derived phase transition engineering on device performance, temperature-related J–V curves of the PISC with DMAI additive were measured and are shown in Fig. 3e. Table S3† gives the performance parameters of corresponding J–V characteristics. When the annealing temperature rises from 100 °C to 200 °C, a gigantic performance enhancement (mainly occurring in the value of Jsc) can be observed (from 0.85 to 4.56 mA cm−2) in terms of the 0D–2D phase transition, which is revealed by the XRD and UV-vis spectra results above.
Although a PCE of 2.74% can be achieved with DMA additive engineering, the value is still much lower than its theoretical value (approaching 20%).43 The main reason is its lower Voc stemming from the bulk/interfacial defects and imperfect band alignments, which would result in substantial nonradiative recombination losses with compromised Voc.44–46 Therefore, we further exploit a strategy by using RbCl as a interfacial layer between Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x with DMAI additive (D-Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x) and Nb2O5 to passivate interfacial defects and optimize band alignment. As seen in the XRD patterns of the perovskite-inspired films deposited on Nb2O5 and RbCl/Nb2O5 substrates (Fig. 4a), the dimer phase diffraction signal near 28° is suppressed for the perovskite-inspired film with a RbCl interfacial layer, meaning that the 0D Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x has been converted to 2D Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x more thoroughly. In addition, the perovskite-inspired film deposited on the RbCl/Nb2O5 substrate exhibits a stronger peak intensity and narrower peak FWHM of the (201) peak than that on the Nb2O5 film, which can also be confirmed by SEM results. The improved crystalline quality and regulated phase transition are probably induced by the RbCl diffusion into D-Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films during the annealing process. A similar phenomenon can also be observed in Cu(In,Ga)Se2 and Sb2S3 solar cells. The UV-vis spectra reveal that both films exhibit an absorption edge at about 600 nm (Fig. S7†). In order to investigate the interface passivation effect of RbCl on Nb2O5. We further examined the surface elements and chemical state of the RbCl/Nb2O5 and Nb2O5 films by washing the surface D-Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x film with DMF solvent to investigate the residual RbCl on the interface. The XPS peaks of Nb, O, Rb 3d and Cl 2p core level can be seen in Fig. 4b and S8,† respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b, both the Nb 3d and O 3d peaks for the RbCl/Nb2O5 film shift toward a lower binding energy area relative to the pristine Nb2O5 film, suggesting a clear change in electron density around Nb and O due to its interaction with RbCl. We deduce that an RbCl–Nb2O5 surface structure is likely formed in the Nb2O5 film during the annealing process instead of being physically stacked. Although there is an interaction between the Nb2O5 and RbCl, the introduction of RbCl did not significantly affect the high transmittance of the Nb2O5 film within the visible light region (Fig. S9†). Moreover, the surface roughness 3D depth profile of ToF-SIMS measurements is used to gain a better understanding of the distribution of elements. As seen in Fig. 4c, Rb+ could diffuse and incorporate into the D-Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x film, which may contribute to the crystallization quality by lowering the formation energy barrier and repressing the proportion of the 0D phase, as observed in the above-discussed XRD patterns. In addition, the distribution of Rb+ in the Nb2O5 can also be observed, which is in accordance with XPS results. The varied energy levels were investigated by UPS measurements and are shown in Fig. 4d and S10.† The work function (WF) of the films can be calculated as 4.15 eV for Nb2O5 and 4.09 eV for RbCl–Nb2O5. Lower WF indicates that RbCl–Nb2O5 tends to be more n-type, which would reduce the energy level barrier and enhance the built-in potential inside the device. The energy level structure in Fig. 4d also shows that in comparison with the reference Nb2O5 ETL, the conduction band of the RbCl–Nb2O5 ETL is much closer to that of the perovskite-inspired film, indicating improved band alignment and thus leading to higher Jsc. The PISCs with a structure of FTO/Nb2O5/RbCl/D-Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x/P3HT/carbon were fabricated to determine the photoelectric conversion performance. As seen in Fig. 5a, the PISC with RbCl interface modification shows a champion PCE of 3.37% (18% higher than the reference one) with an improved performance of Jsc (5.21 mA cm−2vs. 5.86 mA cm−2), Voc (0.89 V vs. 0.93 V) and FF (59% vs. 62%). The optimum concentration for RbCl interface modification is 1 mg mL−1, as shown in Fig. S11.† To the best of our knowledge, they are the highest PCE and Voc values reported for Sb-based PISCs hitherto. Fig. 5d lists the comparison of Voc and corresponding PCE for reported Sb-based photovoltaic devices so far.47–53 The enhanced stabilized PCE (Fig. S12†) and EQE results (Fig. 5c) also confirm the J–V results and almost negligible hysteresis can be observed (Fig. S13†). Besides, the average PV parameters can be acquired and are exhibited in Fig. 5b and Table S4.† RbCl passivated devices have relatively higher average PV parameters of Jsc (4.95 mA cm−2vs. 5.75 mA cm−2), Voc (0.87 V vs. 0.91 V),FF (58% vs. 60%) and PCE (2.46% vs. 3.15%). The distinctly improved performance can be presumably ascribed to the improvement of interface charge transport as well as the increased absorber layer quality by RbCl modification.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed a straightforward and highly repeatable method to regulate the solution-based production of Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films and improve the corresponding device performance. Towards obtaining high-quality Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films with low defect density, DMAI additive was introduced into the precursor solution to regulate the nucleation and crystallization process. Through varying precursor ratios and adjusting the annealing process, some new insights into the DMAI additive strategy for Pb-free perovskite-inspired materials are proposed. The introduced DMAI would act as a volatile additive for nucleation sites and boost the formation of a mix-oriented intermediate 0D phase, which is distinct from the mechanism in Pb-based perovskites. Instead of using an anti-solvent, smooth and compact Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films could readily be achieved by exquisitely controlling the DMAI/CsI ratio. By further interface passivation treatment with RbCl to enhance the built-in electric field, the final PCE of the PISC could reach 3.37% with a relatively high Voc of 0.93 V, which is superior to the current record value of Sb-based PISCs so far. In conclusion, this work proposes a simple, green and repeatable method for the fabrication of Pb-free perovskite-inspired films and provides more promise for the development of their photovoltaic application.
