    , Accepted 2nd July 2014First published on 23rd July 2014AbstractIn this study we report the first organic hydrophilic dye employed for 100% water-based electrolyte DSSCs. We show that the replacement of alkyl by glycolic chains in the dye structure is able to provide excellent wettability, resulting in an efficient system with remarkably reduced desorption problems that allowed us to perform tests over a wide pH range. By changing the electrolyte composition, employing chenodeoxycholic acid as a co-adsorbent and using PEDOT counter-electrodes, 3% power conversion efficiency under 1-sun illumination was obtained. We show that chenodeoxycholic acid does not significantly increase the wettability, and we provide new insights into the higher performance resulting from its co-adsorption.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are considered some of the most promising photovoltaic devices due to their low fabrication cost and high versatility.1–4 The most common DSSC architecture consists of a dye-stained TiO2 film and a Pt counter electrode, assembled into sealed sandwich-type cells. The electrodes are bridged through a liquid electrolyte, whose composition plays a fundamental role in the device performances. The idea of photovoltaic devices based on chromophores adsorbed on TiO2 was born in the 1980s, from studies on the same electrode as a photocatalyst for methane production and photodecomposition of aqueous liquids, in visible light.5–7 Therefore, the photovoltaic pioneering studies were naturally oriented in the direction of aqueous media.8–10 However, the inclusion of water in DSSCs has been later shown to significantly lower the efficiency, and water-soluble dyes, such as the ruthenium complexes initially developed, required pH 3 buffer solutions in order to be firmly anchored on the TiO2 surface without desorbing. Therefore, water was quickly replaced by organic solvents, which are able to provide much higher performances that made DSSCs promising candidates for future commercialization.1,11–13 Furthermore, many efforts have been made to produce sealing agents for complete isolation from moisture.14,15 However, highly performing DSSCs employ liquid electrolytes based on organic solvents and additives usually inflammable and hazardous both to human health and the environment. Therefore, the idea of an efficient, inexpensive, simple, and environmentally friendly system based on water remains still attractive and is pushing the research back in this direction.16–18 DSSCs with remarkable results, based on 100% water electrolytes, have been recently reported by O'Regan et al. and Spiccia et al.19–21 To date, the common approach to develop water-electrolyte DSSCs is based on the use of hydrophobic dyes, to prevent desorption problems.16,18–20 This strategy implies the employment of surfactants in the electrolyte solution to provide sufficient pore wettability, for a good interaction with the dye. However, such additives must be introduced in considerable amounts, complicating the system and possibly resulting in mass transport problems. Currently, the reported [Co(bpy)3](NO3)2 complex is scarcely soluble in water and the ferricyanide-based cells need a blocking layer in order to yield good efficiency. Therefore, we decided to develop a very simple system based on a new approach, using the classical iodide/triiodide as the redox couple. D35 is a well-known dye, developed by Sun et al.22 Our new approach consisted of the synthesis of its hydrophilic analogous, by substituting the hydrophobic alkyl chains with glycolic ones. The resulting hydrophilic dye, V35, shows an extraordinary interaction with water that allowed us to avoid the use of surfactants, without being affected by the same critical desorption issue of water-soluble ruthenium complexes.
Results and discussion
Optical and electrochemical characterization

Fig. 1 shows the molecular structures of the dyes involved in this study, D35 and V35. The synthetic route for V35 is reported in detail in the ESI† (Scheme S1).
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of hydrophobic dye (D35) and hydrophilic dye (V35). 
V35 has been optically and electrochemically characterized to study any possible alteration of such properties with respect to D35, deriving from the use of different chains. UV-Vis absorption and emission spectra in CH2Cl2 of the dyes are reported in Fig. 2. Both dyes exhibit one absorption band in the visible region at 495 and 503 nm for V35 and D35, respectively, related to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Therefore, the dyes slightly differ in terms of maximum absorption and emission wavelengths. In particular, dye V35 exhibits a slightly hypsochromically shifted absorption spectrum and a bathochromically shifted emission spectrum, with respect to D35.

In addition to the slightly shifted spectra, V35 exhibits a relatively low molar extinction coefficient, indicating its reduced ability to harvest light derived from the glycolic chains. Electrochemical measurements reflect the optical observations, showing that the HOMO levels of both dyes are located at slightly different energies. A very small difference is also observed in the values of the optical bandgap and, consequently, of the LUMO level.
Photovoltaic investigation of DSSCs
The new dye V35 has been tested in DSSCs to explore its characteristics with respect to D35. Initial tests were conducted employing an electrolyte composed of NaI and I2 in 100% deionized water and, gradually, modifications were introduced. The experiments initially performed and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are reported in Table 2.

A significant enhancement of the power conversion efficiency is recorded for V35, when KI replaces NaI in the electrolyte composition. Although this aspect has not been further investigated, it is possible to speculate that it is probably related to the ability of glycolic chains, like crown ethers, to coordinate small cations, such as Na+.24,25 The decrease in open-circuit voltage collected in pH 4.0 buffer solution, is due to the polarization induced on the surface by H+ ions, that shifts positively the potential of the CB of TiO2.26 Additionally, this lower efficiency shows that the acidic conditions, necessary to test ruthenium complexes in aqueous solutions, are not suitable for V35, confirming its stability on the surface. The further improvement, observed by doubling the concentration of KI, is probably due to the further shift in the equilibrium that suppresses free iodine concentration.19 Finally, it should be noticed that, under these conditions, no photocurrent was recorded in the devices fabricated employing D35.
Since it has been reported that guanidinium salts and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) act as surfactants,19 their effects on this system were investigated. Table 3 shows the data for the performed experiments.

The reported data show a different response of the dyes to GuSCN. The addition of GuSCN in the electrolyte composition has a negative effect in combination with V35, but a positive impact on the hydrophobic D35. Indeed, by making a comparison between these results and the one recorded without GuSCN, it is evident that this component mainly affects the Jsc values, causing lower efficiency for V35, and higher efficiency for D35. On the other hand, the co-sensitization with CDCA results in a positive effect for both dyes. The combination of the two components does not result in a synergistic effect on V35, reflecting the negative influence of GuSCN. Different results are collected for hydrophobic D35, which exhibits a synergistic effect derived from both GuSCN and CDCA. However, the data suggest that, employed singularly, the guanidinium salt (at this low concentration) and chenodeoxycholic acid are able to provide only slight wetting, associated with the improved performances of D35. Furthermore, it should be pointed out that the synergistic effect on D35 is still not able to exceed the results obtained with V35.
Due to recent improvements reached with electro-polymerized PEDOT counter electrodes on FTO glass,27 a comparison between platinum and PEDOT was made (Table 4). From Table 4 it is evident that PEDOT counter electrodes outperform the platinum ones due to the increased photocurrent and open circuit voltage. Both PEDOT and platinum counter electrodes exhibit total wetting upon deposition of water on the surface, therefore the increased photocurrent cannot be explained in terms of wettability. We attributed this result to the leaf-like PEDOT structure that confers high-surface area, leading to an increase in the catalytic activity. In addition, it is important to notice that we observed a reduced tendency of the dye to desorb, when PEDOT counter electrodes were used. We did not further investigate this phenomenon but we speculated that it can be reasonably due to the ability of PEDOT to include ions in its matrix.28,29 Indeed, we often noticed a slight desorption after a few days when platinum counter electrodes were used, however, we surprisingly did not observe the same phenomenon when PEDOT was employed. We believe that PEDOT partially trapped in its matrix the ions able to adsorb on the surface of TiO2, preventing in this way the desorption of the dye.

Finally, PEDOT counter electrodes represent a cheaper and environmentally friendly alternative to platinum, as they are fabricated from cheap materials and the electropolymerization is carried out at room temperature, in deionized water.
In order to compare the achieved results with a performing electrolyte, dyes V35 and D35 were tested with the best electrolyte reported by O'Regan et al. (Table 5).19

Data reported in Table 5 show that by using very high concentration of guanidinium salt, great wettability is achieved and both hydrophilic and hydrophobic dyes perform similarly. However, elevated concentration of guanidinium salts decreases significantly the Voc due to the absorption of guanidinium cations on the surface of TiO2.30 Measurements performed with and without CDCA show, once again, its remarkable impact on the performances. However, a comparison between the efficiency reported in Tables 4 and 5 confirms that the approach based on a hydrophilic dye that does not need surfactants yields better efficiency.
Further optimization of iodine and CDCA concentrations, yielded the highest efficiency recorded with V35 (Table 6). It should be stressed that the efficiency achieved, 3% under 1 sun (4% under 0.5 sun) illumination, is perfectly in line with the state-of-the-art for D35-modified dyes in water systems.18 However, in the study presented here, no additives and no ionic liquids are employed, confirming the validity of this approach.

Lower iodine concentration significantly improved the Voc value. However, concentrations lower than 10 mM resulted in very low current. The concentration of CDCA must be well balanced as well, as higher concentration led to higher open-circuit voltage, but lower photocurrent, due to the reduced amount of dye absorbed on the surface.
Interesting insights into the role of CDCA can be found in the IPCE and electron lifetime measurements of the most significant experiments (Fig. 3).
 Fig. 3  IPCE spectrum (top) and electron lifetime (bottom) of main DSSCs from this study, with PEDOT counter electrodes. 
The comparison of data recorded with and without CDCA shows its remarkable impact on the electron lifetime. Parallel to this, we observed a significant enhancement of the Voc when CDCA is co-adsorbed on the surface of TiO2. Since CDCA does not shift significantly the conduction band of TiO2,31 we can state that the data indicate a reduction of the recombination processes.
As previously reported (Table 2), the experiment performed in acidic buffer solution resulted in lower efficiency. Therefore, we decided to explore the behaviour of the system under basic conditions employing an electrolyte composed of 4 M KI and 20 mM I2 in pH 8.0 and pH 9.0 buffer solutions. Fig. 4 shows the variation of the photovoltaic parameters recorded, over a period of 18 days. The cells were stored in the dark and measured in the reported days. Both Voc and FF are higher in the case of buffer at pH 9.0, however, this is compensated by a lower photocurrent, that globally lowers the efficiency with respect to the pH 8.0 buffer. Interestingly, Voc considerably increases over time in all the devices fabricated. It is very important to notice that this latter aspect was also exhibited by all the DSSCs of this study. Indeed, it should be specified that the photovoltaic parameters of all the cells in this study were subjected to fluctuations over time and the values reported in the tables were collected after several days of device assembly.

A comparison between the results reported in Table 7 and the efficiency collected in Table 4 clearly shows that the employment of pH 8.0 buffer yields better performance. Since we previously showed a great enhancement of the performances arising from co-sensitization with CDCA, we fabricated devices using the same technique and the pH 8.0 buffer electrolyte solution. However, in this case, we obtained lower efficiency. We did not further investigate this result, but a possible explanation may reside in the fact that CDCA is more soluble in basic solutions rather than in neutral deionized water, and desorption may occur.
Contact angle
A critical aspect in water-based electrolytes for DSSCs is the pore wettability.19 High interfacial contact between the dye and the aqueous electrolyte is essential for efficient dye regeneration and, consequently, good performances. In order to test the properties of V35 and D35 in terms of hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, measurements of the contact angles (θc) were performed. The results show a remarkably different interaction of the dyes with water (Fig. 5).
 Fig. 5  Cross-sections of working electrodes sensitized with D35 (left) and V35 (right) with a drop of deionized water positioned on the top. The pictures, used for the estimation of the contact angles (θc), reflect the hydrophobicity of D35 and hydrophilicity of V35. 
Contact angles >90° indicate hydrophobic character, while values <90° denote the hydrophilic properties of the surface under examination. Therefore, the hypothesis that V35 can provide an excellent surface interaction with aqueous media has been totally validated.
Further investigation on the influence of CDCA on the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity was made by measuring the contact angle of working electrodes co-sensitized with different amounts of CDCA (Table 8).

In particular, co-sensitizing TiO2 with a ratio 1:50/dye:CDCA lowers the value of the contact angle of only 15° in the case of V35, and 20° in the case of D35. These results are consistent with the data collected in Table 3, where the 1:50/D35:CDCA ratio does not provide a sufficient wettability for efficient current flow and good performance. On the other hand, the electrolyte employing 8 M of GuI is able to provide total wetting for both dyes.
Photo-induced absorption spectroscopy (PIA)
In order to complete the photovoltaic cycle by restoring the electroneutrality of the dye, the interaction between the sensitizer and the electrolyte solution is crucial. The remarkable wettability induced by the glycolic chains is reflected in the photo-induced absorption measurements (Fig. 6–8).
 Fig. 6  Photo-induced absorption spectra of V35 and D35 dyes in water, and in water/2 M KI in water electrolytes. 
 Fig. 7  Photo-induced absorption spectra of V35 and D35 dyes in water, and co-sensitized with CDCA in water/2 M KI in water saturated with CDCA electrolytes. 
 Fig. 8  Photo-induced absorption spectra of V35 and D35 dyes with 8 M GuI in water solution. 
PIA measurements were not performed with full electrolyte composition as iodine seems to shift the spectra. Fig. 6 shows that V35 is fully regenerated by the electrolyte. The V35/water signal exhibits an absorption peak at 600 nm and a rising signal after approximately 780 nm, related to the absorption of the oxidized dye. When 2 M KI solution is employed, the signal turns flat and the absorption peaks at 600 nm and after 780 nm disappear, indicating reduction of the oxidized dye. D35 exhibits the same profile, however, when 2 M KI is added, the signal after 780 nm does not turn completely flat, indicating that the dye is not fully regenerated.
The effect of the co-adsorption with CDCA was also investigated with this technique (Fig. 7).
V35, co-sensitized with CDCA reduces the absorption peak at 600 nm and the rise in absorption at above 780 nm. D35 shows still strong signals of its oxidized form.
Guanidinium salts have been recently employed with great success in 100% water-based DSSCs.19 We previously reported our investigation on the effect of the guanidinium salts on this water system (Tables 3 and 5). Fig. 8 shows the PIA spectrum of V35 and D35 dyes employing a guanidinium iodide solution in water.
Once again, the data show that V35 undergoes complete regeneration while D35, due to its hydrophobic alkoxyl chains, is still not fully regenerated.
A particularly interesting aspect arising from PIA measurements is that the dyes seem to give different Stark effects. In Fig. 6–8 it is possible to see how the signal related to the Stark effect at around 550 nm is decreased, almost lost, when measuring V35 in combination with the iodide salts. On the other hand, the combination of V35/Water and D35 does not show this behaviour. This difference may reside in the different mobilities of the ions in the different systems. However, this aspect was not further investigated.
Conclusions
In conclusion, a simple water-based system, based on the first organic dye bearing glycolic chains on the donor moiety, has been presented.
We have shown that the replacement of alkyl chains by glycolic ones does not result in a modification of the optical and electrochemical properties of the organic sensitizer V35, but it dramatically affects its hydrophilicity. By providing an excellent interaction at the dye/electrolyte solution interface with V35, we have been able to record good performances without the employment of additional surfactants. In contrast, hydrophobic dye D35 does not perform in the absence of a surfactant. A comparison with a highly performing electrolyte based on GuI shows that in the presence of a remarkable amount of surfactant V35 and D35 perform very similarly. However, V35 is able to provide higher efficiency in combination with a simple electrolyte composition, without surfactants, confirming the validity of the new approach. The results provided by photo-induced absorption measurements provide an additional confirmation to the fact that the glycolic chains provide good interaction with the water-based electrolyte, positively affecting the regeneration of the dye. On the other hand, the hydrophobic alkoxyl chains on D35 create problems for the redox couple to reach the hole, located on the triphenylamine unit, for regenerating the oxidized dye. The lower performances recorded by using acidic buffer solutions, and the good results obtained by employing basic pH buffer solutions, show a good stability of the dye on the surface of TiO2 in contrast to the previously employed hydrophilic ruthenium complexes. In addition, we investigated the role of chenodeoxycholic acid, showing its negligible surfactant properties. From the data presented, we can firmly state that the remarkable improvements derived from its co-adsorption are not due to the slightly increased wettability but are, more likely, connected to its ability to reduce recombination processes.
Experimental section
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received unless noted otherwise. FTO-coated glass substrates were purchased from Pilkington. TEC15 and TEC8 were used for working electrodes and counter electrodes, respectively.
Optical characterization
Equipment used for the evaluation of the molar extinction coefficient: Jenway 6505 UV/Vis Spectrometer. Equipment used for other absorption measurements (desorption study in the ESI†): UV-Vis NIR Light Source DH-2000-BAL from Mikropack used together with a spectrometer from Ocean Optics inc. (HR 2000 High Resolution spectrometer). The emission spectra were recorded using a Horiba Jobin Yvon Fluorolog with correction files for wavelength-dependent sensitivity of the instrument.
Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells
FTO glass substrates TEC15 were washed in an ultrasonic bath for one hour with each of the following media: detergent, deionized water and ethanol. The glass substrates were pre-treated in a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 90 min and then washed with water and ethanol. After drying in air the substrates were screen printed (active area 0.25 cm2) one time with a Dyesol 18 NR-T paste, 20 nm particle size (thickness around 3.0 μm after sintering). The substrates were dried at 125 °C for 10 min before being screen-printed with a TiO2-scattering paste (Solaronix Ti-Nanooxide R/SP). The samples (total thickness around 8 μm) were heated gradually at 180 °C (10 min), 320 °C (10 min), 390 °C (10 min) and 500 °C (60 min) in an oven (Nabertherm Controller P320) in air atmosphere. After sintering the samples were once again treated with 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 at 70 °C, for 30 min. A final heating step (500 °C for 60 min) was performed. Before immersing the electrodes in the dye bath the electrodes were cooled to 90 °C. The dye baths of V35 and D35 had a concentration of 0.2 mM in ethanol. The organic dye V35 (structure in Fig. 1) was developed in KTH-Stockholm (synthetic procedure in the ESI†). The films were left in a dye bath overnight (14 h) in the dark, rinsed with ethanol and assembled in a sandwich structure with the counter electrode. A 30 μm thick thermoplastic Surlyn frame was used (Meltonix 1170-25 from Solaronix). The electrolyte was introduced in the solar cells through one of the two predrilled holes, sealed with a thermoplastic Surlyn cover and a glass coverslip.
Preparation of counter electrodes
A predrilled two-hole TEC8 glass was washed in an ultrasonic bath for one hour with each of the three following media; detergent (RBS25, 99%, Fluka), deionized water and ethanol (VWR DBH Prolabo, 99.9%). The solution for electropolymerization contained a micellar aqueous solution of 0.1 M SDS (>99% purity) and 0.01 M EDOT and was obtained by dissolving the SDS and EDOT in deionized water and ultrasonicating for one hour according to the method reported by Sakmeche et al.32 Electropolymerization of EDOT was performed with an IviumStat.XR (Ivium Technologies) electrochemical instrument in the galvanostatic mode; a two-electrode cell with a 9 cm × 9 cm conducting glass as the counter electrode and a predrilled washed 9 cm × 9 cm TEC8 glass as the working electrode was used for this purpose, and a constant current of 13 mA was applied (the working electrode potential was about 1.22 V vs. NHE). The PEDOT deposit was blue-colored (electropolymerization time: 320 s).
Platinum counter electrodes (TEC8) were prepared by depositing 10 μL cm−2 of a 4.8 mM H2PtCl6 solution in ethanol to the glass substrate followed by heating in air at 400 °C for 30 min.
Characterization of dye-sensitized solar cells
Current–voltage (I–V) measurements were carried out with a Keithley 2400 source/meter and a Newport solar simulator (model 91160); the light intensity was calibrated using a certified reference solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE), to an intensity of 1000 W m−2. For the I–V-measurements a black mask with an aperture of 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm was used in order to avoid significant additional contribution from light impinging on the device outside the active area (0.5 cm × 0.5 cm). The apparatus for incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and electron lifetime measurements has been previously described.33 The photo-induced absorption setup has been described in detail elsewhere.34 The samples were excited by a blue LED (Luxeon Star 1 W, Blue, 470 nm), and square-wave modulated (on/off) by using a HP 33120A waveform generator and a home-built LED driver system. The excitation light was superimposed on the white pump light provided by a 20 W tungsten-halogen lamp. The transmitted probe light was focused onto a monochromator (Acton Research Corporation SP-150) and detected using a UV-enhanced Si photodiode, connected to a lock-in amplifier via a current amplifier (Stanford Research Systems models 830 and 570, respectively). For time-resolved studies the output of the current amplifier was connected to a data acquisition board (National Instruments PCI-6052E).
Contact angle
Images for contact angle measurements were collected employing a Dino-Lite Pro AM413T microscope. Elaboration of images was performed using Dinocapture 2.0 software. Working electrode preparation followed the same general procedure previously reported. One active layer (a total thickness around 3.0 μm after sintering) was screen-printed using Dyesol 18 NR-T paste, 20 nm particle size. The screen-printed electrodes were heated at 500 °C, cooled down to 90 °C and placed in an appropriate dye bath.
