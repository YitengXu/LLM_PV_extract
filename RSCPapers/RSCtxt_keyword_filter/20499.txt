    , Accepted 10th September 2015First published on 10th September 2015AbstractThe interfaces between different materials in the heterojunction colloidal quantum dot (QD) solar cell play an important role for charge carrier separation, recombination and collection. Here, an organic–inorganic hybrid p–i–n architecture for the heterojunction PbS QD solid solar cell is constructed to increase the charge extraction and reduce charge recombination. Heavily doped poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) is applied as hole transport interlayer between the QD film and metal contact electrode. The results show that the P3HT interlayer diminishes the charge carrier recombination at the QD film/metal contact electrode interface leading to increased open-circuit voltage and increased electron life time. Furthermore, after incorporation of P3HT interlayer an additional p–i heterojunction might form at P3HT/QD film interface resulting in increased depletion region, which promotes charge carrier extraction under working conditions. Two other organic p-type interlayers are also investigated, however, the results indicate that a barrier for charge extraction is formed for these devices, which is explained by the difference in energy levels. The solar cell with the P3HT interlayer exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 5.1% at 1 sun of illumination and ambient atmosphere, which is ∼20% higher compared to the solar cell without any hole transport interlayer.
Introduction
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have attracted considerable attention for promising applications in optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices due to their size-dependent optical, electronic, and optoelectronic properties.1–4 Particularly, lead sulfide (PbS) QDs exhibit a strong quantum confinement effect and a tunable band gap energy (Eg) covering a broad wavelength range in the infrared region, making them attractive light absorbing materials for solar cells.5–9 Furthermore, the energy-band levels and optoelectronic properties can be tuned through different surface ligands,10,11 which allows for fabrication of QD solar cells with different architectures to improve the performance.12,13 One of the recently investigated QD solar cells is the solution-processed heterojunction solar cell, with a layer of QDs (sometimes called a QD solid) absorbing light and also transporting charge carriers,11,14,15 which is different to a QD-sensitized solar cell (QDSSC), where photogenerated electrons are injected into a mesoporous semiconductor substrate from the excited-state QDs.16 Since the solution-processed heterojunction QD solar cell was reported a few years ago,17 a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) more than 8% has been reported.4,18,19
For a typical heterojunction QD solar cell, the QD film is deposited on a n-type semiconductor oxide (TiO2 or ZnO) substrate forming a depletion region at the oxide/QD film interface to separate and collect charge carriers. As to increase the charge carrier extraction from the QD film, inorganic hole transport interlayers, such as MoO3,20 CuI,21 CdS,22 LiF,23 and oxidized PbS QDs12 have been incorporated between the QD film and the top metal contact electrode to eliminate the Schottky diode contact. After inserting either of these interlayers, the performance was largely improved, which was explained by either an increased hole extraction, a decrease in dark current or a combination of these two effects. The most often applied hole transport interlayer is MoO3, whose introduction led to a considerable improvement of the conversion efficiency from 0.64% to 2.9%.20 However, the material properties of MoO3 remain ill-understood – the question as to whether the material is p- or n-type for example is not yet settled21,24 and the energy band levels highly depend on the synthesis method of MoO3 (ref. 25–27) – and the device performance heavily relies on the MoO3 interlayer thickness.20
Herein, an organic–inorganic hybrid p–i–n architecture for the heterojunction PbS QD solid solar cell was constructed using an organic p-type material as hole transport material (HTM) interlayer between the QD film and top metal electrode to increase the charge extraction. Organic hole transport interlayers have a number of important advantages, such as deposition from solution and a vast tunability by molecular modifications which enable precise optimization of the device. TiO2 was used as the n-type material deposited on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) as transparent electrode. We find that including an interlayer of heavily doped p-type P3HT in the solar cell, the P3HT interlayer results in enhanced open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), electron lifetime (τe) and hence improved performance, indicating that the P3HT interlayer diminishes the possibility of charge recombination at the QD film/metal contact electrode interface. Furthermore, the depletion region formed at the i–n junction of QD film/TiO2 may augment by another depletion region formed at the p–i junction of P3HT/QD film, resulting in an increased depletion region. We also compare the performance of the solar cells with organic interlayer to the solar cells with a MoO3 interlayer, which shows that the organic interlayer gives higher efficiency.
Results and discussion
Oleic acid capped PbS QDs were synthesized according to a previously reported method.28–30Fig. 1a shows the light absorption and normalized photoluminescence spectra of the QDs, which indicates that the maximum of the absorbance and photoluminescence related to the first exciton transition are at ∼948 nm and ∼980 nm, respectively. Using transmission electronic microscopy (TEM, Fig. 1b and S1†), the size of the QDs was found to be around 3 nm, a figure in agreement with the size expected from the absorption and photoluminescence spectra.29

Fig. 2a schematically shows the architecture of the hybrid heterojunction solar cell considered here. The cell was fabricated on an FTO substrate, and all processing steps were performed under ambient condition. The n-type transparent TiO2 layer with a conduction band effective density of state of ∼1019 cm−3 (see ref. 4) was deposited on the FTO substrate and the light absorbing QD film was prepared on the TiO2 layer (Fig. S2†) using sequential spin-casting method and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) treatment to increase the charge carrier mobility between QDs. As to efficiently extract holes from the excited-state QDs, three heavily doped p-type organic HTMs with different energy levels, i.e., 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenilamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD), poly[bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) and poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT), were investigated. The organic HTM was covered on the QD film by spin-casting from solution and finally a top Au electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation forming the complete hybrid cells. Fig. 2b shows a cross-sectional scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) image of a thus formed cell.

The energy level diagram of the FTO, TiO2, PbS QDs, different HTMs, and Au is displayed in Fig. 2c, with energy levels taken from literatures.31–34 The energy of the highest occupied (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the QDs in relation to the HOMO level of P3HT and the conduction band of TiO2, respectively, may provide an energetically favorable path for the hole and electron to the contacts. However, the HOMO level of both PTAA and Spiro is somewhat lower in energy than the HOMO level of the QDs, which may result in a barrier for hole injection from the QDs to the HTM.

Fig. 3a and b displays the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves and corresponding performance parameters of the cells with a thin QD film (∼250 nm) without any hole transporting interlayer and with different interlayers under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G illumination. As seen, the HTM strongly influences the cell performance as expected above. One of the advantages of the cell with a p–i–n architecture is the possibility to avoid Schottky barriers at the QD film/metal contact electrode interface.34 For the solar cell without any hole transport interlayer, a heterojunction with a band-bending in the QD film is formed at the TiO2/QD film interface and, meanwhile, at the QD film/metal contact electrode interface a Schottky junction with downward band-bending may form,20 which could result in the back transport of photogenerated electron (dashed arrow in Fig. 3c) and a barrier for hole injection into the Au electrode.20,35,36

(c) Schematic band bending in the HTM free solar cell. (d) Schematic band bending in the inorganic–organic heterojunction QD solar cell with P3HT interlayer between the PbS QD layer and the Au electrode. The hole transport to the Au contact may be limited as indicated dashed arrow. (e) Schematic band bending in the cell with PTAA or Spiro as interlayer between the PbS QD layer and the Au electrode. 
After incorporation of the P3HT interlayer between the QD film and Au electrode forming the described hybrid heterojunction structure, both fill factor (FF) and open circuit voltage (Voc) are significantly enhanced (Fig. 3b). The charge recombination occurring at the QD film/Au interface may also diminish (dashed arrow in Fig. 3d), resulting in increased efficiency. In contrast, the poor performance observed for the cells with PTAA or Spiro as HTM may result from a barrier for hole injection into the Au electrode due to an unfavorable energy level alignment as suggested above (Fig. 3e).
The performance of QD solar cells is highly dependent on the thickness of the QD film,22,37 where the optimal thickness is a compromise between light absorption and charge carrier extraction. The J–V characteristic curves of the hybrid cells with a range of thicknesses (120–370 nm) of the QD film is shown in Fig. 4, and the corresponding performance parameters are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. S3.† We observed a decrease of Voc and an increase in Jsc with increasing QD film thickness and the optimal thickness was found to be ∼320 nm. The enhanced Jsc is attributed to the increased light absorption of the thick QD film (Fig. S4†). For the thin QD film, part of the visible light is not only absorbed by the QDs but also by the P3HT, such that the electron injection from P3HT into the QDs may contribute to the photocurrent. For the thicker QD films, the light absorption in the visible is stronger and the light absorption in P3HT may be negligible (Fig. S4†).

The highest PCE obtained here for the solar cell with P3HT interlayers is 5.1%, which is a large improvement as compared to the solar cell without P3HT, with similar QD film thickness in this study, and the reported PCE of 3.66% with only Au contact.38,39 In addition, for a cell without any hole transport interlayer it was found that the optimal thickness of the QD layer is smaller,38 which might be explained by a more narrow depletion region. When the thickness of the QD film is equal to or smaller than the total width of the depletion region width and charge diffusion length, the photogenerated charge carriers can be efficiently collected as a result of the built-in electronic field and diffusion.37 However, if the QD film is thicker than that width, the charge carriers may be particularly prone to recombination at the rear of the cell and also the series resistance will be higher, resulting in a lower FF. This probably explains why the cell with the thickest QD film showed a decreased performance. Enhancing the charge extraction from the quasi-neutral region has been reported via controlling the charge diffusion length and trap density in the QD film,37 which may be a promising route to further improve the performance of QD solar cells.
It has previously been reported that other inorganic hole transport interlayers between the QD film and the Au contact can improve the cell performance. For example inclusion of a MoO3 interlayer improved the efficiency resulting in a PCE of 3.9%,20 a CdS interlayer resulted in a PCE of 3.5%,22 a CuI interlayer resulted in a PCE of 3.58%,21 and an oxidized PbS interlayer resulted in a PCE of 3.39%.12 In this work, a solar cell with MoO3 interlayer was also fabricated for performance comparison. Fig. 5a shows the J–V characteristic curves of the best cells without any hole transporting interlayer, and with MoO3 or P3HT hole transport interlayer, respectively, and the corresponding performance parameters are summarized in Table 2. The statistical results for a number of cells without any hole transporting interlayer and with MoO3 or P3HT hole transport interlayer are displayed in Fig. S5,† which show that there is a clear difference when the interlayers are added to the devices. A PCE of 4.2% was obtained for the best cell without any hole transporting interlayer. After including a MoO3 interlayer, the best cell shows an improved efficiency of 4.9%, due to an increased FF and Voc. The best cell with P3HT interlayer has a 5.1% efficiency, which is around 20% and 5% higher than the cell without any interlayer and with MoO3 interlayer, respectively. Fig. 5b shows the dark current curves of the corresponding cells in Fig. 5a, which suggests the diode turn-on voltage, depending on the built-in potential, is higher for the cell with P3HT interlayer. Fig. 5c shows the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the hybrid cell, which indicates that the solar cell exhibits good photo response in a range of 330–1100 nm.

Fig. 6a and b shows the light intensity dependence of Voc and Jsc of above cells. The Voc increases linearly with the logarithm of the light intensity, and the Jsc increases linearly with the light intensity. For the cell without any hole transporting interlayer, a lower Voc is obtained at higher light intensity compared to the cells with MoO3 or P3HT interlayer, which suggests that there may be higher charge recombination in the cell without any interlayer. As to better understand how inclusion of the P3HT interlayer in the solar cell leads to improved performance, the electron lifetime was investigated, as shown in Fig. 6c. The electron lifetime (τe, also called recombination time of the photogenerated charge carriers) was determined from the Voc transient decay under white light illumination with a modulated perturbation.40,41 The τe is obtained as a function of the Voc (or light intensity), and a decrease in τe was observed at higher Voc resulting from relatively faster charge recombination. We found the cell without any hole transport interlayer shows lower τe, which may be explained by faster charge recombination from the QDs to Au contact. After incorporated P3HT or MoO3 interlayer, an increased τe was observed, which suggests the cells show a longer charge recombination time that is in accordance with above higher photovoltage.

(c) Electron lifetime as a function of Voc for the cells without any hole transport interlayer and with MoO3 or P3HT interlayer between QD film and metal contact electrode. 
Capacitance–voltage (Cap–V) analysis was further conducted to investigate the depletion region after incorporation P3HT hole transporting interlayer in the cell. The corresponding Mott–Schottky curves (1/C2–V) are displayed in Fig. 7, where cells without any hole transporting interlayer and with P3HT interlayer are compared. For the cell without any hole transporting interlayer, 1/C2 shows a negligible change under the reverse bias, which indicates that the PbS QD film is fully depleted at these bias voltages. However, under the forward bias, the depletion region becomes narrower, and when the depletion region is smaller than the thickness of QD film the 1/C2 begins to decrease and a quasi-neutral region develops at the rear of cell. In contrast, after incorporation P3HT interlayer in the cell, 1/C2 starts to decrease even at the reverse bias, which may be due to the QD film is fully depleted in this case. Since the P3HT layer is highly doped we assume that an ohmic contact is formed between the P3HT layer and the Au contact, and the increased depletion then may come from the p–i junction of P3HT/QD film interface. However, the difference in the Mott–Schottky plot for the two samples is not easy to interpret since there are several materials and interfaces present in the sample, and other methods will later be used to reveal the role of the P3HT in more detail.
 Fig. 7  Mott–Schottky curves of the cells without any hole transport interlayer or with P3HT hole transport interlayer between QD film and metal contact electrode. 
The doping density at different bias was estimated according to the slope of the Mott–Schottky curves (Fig. S6†),18,20 which indicates the cell without any hole transport interlayer shows a doping density of 2(±1) × 1016 cm−3. In contrast, the cell with P3HT interlayer shows two doping densities of 8(±2) × 1015 cm−3 and 5(±1) × 1016 cm−3 (Fig. S6†), which may form at n–i junction of TiO2/QD film interface and p–i junction of P3HT/QD film interface, respectively. It is worth noting that the hole density of the applied P3HT (doped density of ∼2 × 1021 cm−3) is ∼1019 cm−3 and electron density of TiO2 is ∼1019 cm−3.4,42 Both of them are much higher than the doping density of 1015–1017 cm−3 in the PbS QDs,14,18 which suggests that the formed depletion region is mainly in the QD film. The total depletion region was estimated according to reported methods,20,43 and the depletion width of the cell with p-type P3HT interlayer is estimated to 284 ± 18 nm. The electron diffusion length in the QD solid with MPA terminal ligands is ∼30 nm,1 which suggests that the total width of the depletion region and the electron diffusion length is in good agreement with the QD film thickness. In contrast, the solar cell without any hole transport interlayer a depletion width of 257 ± 15 nm is estimated, which is consistent with reported results.14,18
Theoretically, a solar cell with an increased depletion region will result in a higher built-in electronic field in the QD film. This should increase the charge carrier extraction, especially leading to an increased current density (Jmpp) and voltage (Vmpp) at the maximum power point.18,37 As expected, the Vmpp and Jmpp are all enhanced for the cell after incorporation of P3HT interlayer (Fig. S7†), which may result from a better charge carrier extraction due to the increased depletion region,18 and less charge recombination.
The changes in the photovoltaic properties of an un-encapsulated cell stored under ambient atmosphere were measured to evaluate the stability and the results show that the cell performance can be maintained at a high level for some time also without sealing. The cell with the P3HT interlayer exhibits similar stability as those using an inorganic interlayer between the QD film and the metal contact12,44 and the efficiency decreased by ∼20% over 7 days and the decrease was mainly due to the decrease in both Voc and FF (see Fig. S8†).
Even though the recent remarkable efficiencies obtained for perovskite solar cells, each platform has advantages and drawbacks: while perovskite hold the edge in efficiency, with certified PCE over 20%, QD solar cells offer band gap tunability into the infrared and interesting quantum size effects.1,45 Continuous progress in the fundamental physical chemistry and device physics of both QD and perovskite solar cells will be mutually beneficial, with many insights applying to each platform.
Conclusions
In summary, an organic–inorganic hybrid p–i–n architecture for heterojunction QD solid solar cell was constructed to enhance charge extraction using an organic p-type material as hole transport interlayer between the QD film and metal contact electrode. With this architecture and P3HT as organic hole transport interlayer, the performance was considerably improved comparing with the solar cell without any hole transport interlayer. The P3HT interlayer diminished the charge recombination at the QD film/Au electrode interface leading to increased τe and Voc. The enhanced performance may also be attributed to the p–i heterojunction formed at the P3HT/QD film interface, which might increase the depletion region. The results were also compared to a device with an inorganic MoO3 layer between the QD film and the Au contact and in comparison, the P3HT interlayer especially results in higher photocurrent and voltage at the maximum power point. The hybrid cell showed a PCE of 5.1% under AM1.5G illumination with 100 mW cm−2 intensity and ambient atmosphere, which is an increase by ∼20% comparing with the cell without any hole transport interlayer and ∼5% comparing with the cell with an inorganic MoO3 hole transport interlayer.
Experimental
PbS QD synthesis
PbS QDs were synthesized according to the method reported by E. H. Sargent30,46 with small modification. Briefly, 0.93 g lead (II) oxide (PbO, 99.999%) and 4.05 g oleic acid (OA, technical grade 90%) were added to 20 mL octadecene (ODE, technical grade 90%) in a three-neck flask (100 mL), of which was heated at 90 °C over night under vacuum condition and then protected with nitrogen gas. 0.35 g hexamethyldisilathiane (TMS, synthesis grade) was added to 20 mL ODE in glovebox, and the mixture was heated at 70 °C for 8 h under vacuum condition. After increasing the temperature of three-neck flask to 100 °C, the mixed solution of TMS and ODE was swiftly injected into the flask and the solution was gradually cooled to room temperature. Toluene diluted with acetone was added to the obtained dark solution to separate the PbS QDs and the received QDs were dispersed in toluene. This washing step was repeated several times. After washing, the QDs were precipitated again with acetone and centrifuged. After dried, the obtained dark particles was finally dispersed in octane (∼50 mg mL−1) and stored in an argon-filled glovebox.
Solar cell fabrication
A compact TiO2 film was prepared on the cleaned FTO glass (TEC15, Pilkington) following our previous reported method.47 The PbS QD film was prepared on the TiO2 using layer-by-layer spin-casting method under ambient condition. Two drops PbS QDs solution was dispensed on the TiO2 and spun at 2500 rpm for 15 s. Five drops of 1% 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) in methanol (v/v) was dropped on the QD film and also spun at 2500 rpm. The QD film was rinsed with methanol and spun at 2500 rpm. The washing steps were repeated two times. The above procedures were repeated until the desired QD film thickness was reached. The different HTM layers were covered on the QD films by spin-casting the mixture of P3HT (20 mg mL−1), bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI, 64 mM), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 198 mM) and chlorobenzene (1 mL); the mixture of PTAA (15 mg mL−1), TBP (3.4 μL), and LiTFSI (64 mM) and chlorobenzene (1 mL); and the mixture of Spiro-OMeTAD (170 mM), TBP (198 mM), LiTFSI (64 mM) and chlorobenzene (1 mL), respectively, at 3000 rpm for 30 s. The samples were stored in air overnight and then a counter electrode Au with a thickness of ∼80 nm was deposited on HTM layer using a thermal evaporator (LEICA EM MED020) in a vacuum of 4 × 10−5 Torr, forming the complete solar cell. For the solar cell with an MoO3 hole transport interlayer, MoO3 with a thickness of ∼25 nm was thermally evaporated at a rate of 0.01 nm s−1 and then deposited contact electrode.
Solar cell characterization
Newport solar simulator (model 91160) was used to provide a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 illumination (1 sun) that was calibrated using a certified reference Si solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE). The J–V curves were recorded by means of a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The working area of cell was 20 mm2. IPCE spectra were recorded using a computer-controlled setup consisting of a xenon lamp (Spectral Products ASBXE 175), a monochromator (Spectral Products CM110), a LabJack U6, and a potentiostat (PINE, AFRDE 5). The setup was calibrated using a certified reference solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE) prior to measurement. The intensity dependence of voltage and current was recorded with a 16-bit resolution digital acquisition board (National Instruments) in combination with a current amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR570) and a custom-made system using electromagnetic switches. Electron lifetime measurements were performed according to our previously reported method.41,48
Cap–V measurements
Capacitance–voltage (Cap–V) measurements were performed using an Autolab Potentiostat Galvanostat with modulation frequency and amplitude of 1 kHz and 10 mV, respectively, under dark condition according to the ref. 18. The solar cells were placed in a metal box with a sample holder to ensure the connections and eliminate the interaction with the surrounding. The voltage sweep was performed between −1 V and 1 V with an AC signal.
Materials characterization
Light absorption spectra were measured using an Ocean Optics HR2000 spectrometer with a Micropack DH-2000-BAL light source. The photoluminescence spectrum was recorded using Fluorolog Spectrophotometer (HORIBA JOBIN YNON) with a Xe lamp. SEM images were collected using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss LEO1550) at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV, and TEM images were performed using a transmission electron microscope (JSM 2100) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.
