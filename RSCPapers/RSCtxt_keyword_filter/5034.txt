    , Accepted 11th September 2020First published on 11th September 2020AbstractInterfacial charge transfer between the donor and acceptor plays a crucial role in determining the photo-induced charge generation mechanisms and efficiencies for organic solar cells. Here, we have theoretically investigated the exciton-dissociation and charge-recombination processes in complexes consisting of a wide-bandgap polymer donor D18 and a narrow-bandgap small-molecule acceptor Y6, which exhibit the best organic photovoltaic performance to date. The results show that besides the lowest charge-transfer (CT0) state, there are also four higher-lying CT states below the lowest singlet excited state (S1) of D18, and the excitons on D18 will dissociate into the higher-lying CT states much faster (1010–1012 s−1) than into the CT0 state (107–108 s−1). In contrast, only the CT0 state is below the S1 state of Y6 due to the small driving force for hole transfer from Y6 to D18, while the dissociation rates of Y6 excitons into the CT0 state can be very high (1013 s−1). Importantly, the rates of charge recombination are mostly lower than 106 s−1. These results are fully consistent with the highly efficient exciton dissociation and low charge recombination observed by experiments. Our work underlines the importance of multi-channel exciton dissociation for high-efficiency organic photovoltaics.
Introduction
Non-fullerene organic solar cells (NF-OSCs) consisting of wide-bandgap polymer donors and narrow-bandgap small-molecule acceptors (SMAs) have achieved great progress in recent years, due to the marked advantages of strong optical absorption, tunable energy-level, and ease of structural modifications for the acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structured SMAs.1–6 The emergence of ITIC in 2015 provided a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.8%, enabling NF-OSCs to challenge fullerene-based OSCs and bringing new prospects for organic photovoltaics.7 With the development of polymer donors, e.g. PBDB-T8,9 and J71,10 the PCE of the ITIC-based OSCs could surpass 11%. Further fluorination of ITIC producing IT-4F provided a high PCE of 13.1% when blended with the donor PBDB-T-SF.11 After incorporation of an electron-deficient core in the donor units of the A–D–A acceptors, the PCE was improved to 15.7% for Y6 when combined with the donor PM6 in 2019.12 Meanwhile, a number of polymer donors (such as D16,13 PTQ10,14 and P2F-EHp15) were developed, demonstrating excellent PCEs of over 16%. More recently, the blends of polymer donor D18 and acceptor Y6 achieved a record PCE of 18.22% to date.16
It should be noted that both electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor and hole transfer from the acceptor to the donor have been demonstrated to be efficient in the dissociation of the donor and acceptor excitons for these high-performance NF-OSCs, even though the driving forces for hole transfer are quite small. For instance, for the J71/ITIC blend with an energy difference (ΔEHOMO) between the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) of only 0.11 eV, ultrafast hole transfer from ITIC to J71 could occur at a rate of ∼3 ps−1.10 Similarly, Chen et al. have investigated six donor/acceptor combinations with different ΔEHOMO and also found ultrafast hole transfer at the timescale of ≤4.6 ps despite the vanishingly small ΔEHOMO.17 In addition, the photovoltaic devices based on such systems exhibited a relatively low voltage loss (ΔVloss) of ∼0.6 eV, contributing to high open-circuit voltage and PCE. Moreover, the ΔVloss was measured to be 0.568 eV for PM6/Y6 with ΔEHOMO of 0.2 eV,18 and even as low as 0.473 eV for D18/Y6 with ΔEHOMO of 0.14 eV.16
To gain an in-depth understanding of the efficient exciton dissociation and low energy loss in the high-efficiency NF-OSCs, we have theoretically investigated the interfacial charge-transfer (CT) processes by taking the D18/Y6 complexes as a representative. We have calculated the electronic couplings and rates for the exciton dissociation (ED) and charge recombination (CR) processes. The calculated results point to that the excitons can dissociate through multiple channels. The D18 excitons will dissociate into the higher-lying CT states efficiently and the rates are much faster than those into the lowest CT (CT0) state. Although the Y6 excitons can only dissociate into the CT0 state, the dissociation rates are very high despite the small driving force. At the same time, the CR rates are found to be much lower than the ED rates, which is beneficial to decrease the energy loss.
Computational methods
Construction of complexes
Side chains can have a significant impact on the donor/acceptor complex geometries.19–21 For considering the effect of bulky alkyls on intermolecular packing to construct D18/Y6 complexes reasonably, one repeating unit of D18 and Y6 with whole alkyls were optimized first (Fig. S1†). As seen in Fig. S1,† the bulky alkyl side chains on the central unit of Y6 seriously hinder the approach of its backbone towards D18. Instead, it is much easier for the electron-withdrawing end-groups of Y6 to stack with D18. In addition, since both sides of the electron-donating units of D18 have big alkylthienyl chains, it can be expected that the end-groups of Y6 tend to approach the electron-withdrawing units of D18, as demonstrated previously by molecular dynamics simulations of the PBDB-T/ITIC blending films.19 So we focus on the D18/Y6 complex configuration with the end-groups of Y6 close to the electron-withdrawing units of D18 here. Furthermore, it is found that the frontier orbitals are mainly localized on two repeating units of D18 (Fig. S2†). For saving the computation cost, two repeating units were used to represent D18, and all the alkyl groups in D18 and Y6 were replaced by methyl (Fig. S3†) to construct the D18/Y6 complex geometries. The geometry optimizations for the ground and charged states of isolated D18 and Y6 were performed by density functional theory (DFT) and the excited-state geometries were optimized by time-dependent DFT (TDDFT). Then the initial complex geometry was built by using the optimized ground-state geometries of isolated D18 and Y6 with the benzene ring in the end-group of Y6 parallel to the benzene ring in the middle electron-withdrawing unit (DTBT) of D18 and the inter-plane distance set to be 3.5 Å (Fig. S4†). Subsequently, the complex geometry was optimized by DFT including Grimme's dispersion (D3 version).22 All the above DFT and TDDFT calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G** level with the Gaussian-09 package.23 The excitation energies and ionization energies of D18 and Y6 were also computed by using the optimally tuned long-range corrected functional ωB97XD in conjugation with the polarizable continuum model.24,25
Calculation of charge-transfer rates
The ED and CR rates were calculated by using the Marcus electron-transfer theory,26 (1)where V, λ, and ΔG are the electronic couplings between the initial and final states, reorganization energy, and Gibbs free energy, respectively. kB and ℏ denote the Boltzmann and the reduced Planck constant, respectively. The temperature T is set to 300 K in the calculations. The electronic couplings (V) were computed by a diabatic-state approach reported by us previously,27,28 V = 〈ΨLE|H|ΨCT〉(2)Here, ΨLE and ΨCT represent the local excited states (including the ground state) and the CT states, respectively, which are constructed by using the spin-adapted antisymmetrized products of the isolated donor and acceptor wavefunctions. (3) (4)Here, S and M are the total spin and spin projection of the complex; ΨDi (ΨAj), the ith (jth) excited state of the donor (acceptor) with spin Si (Sj) and spin projection Mi (Mj); and ΨDk+ (ΨAl−) the oxidized state of the donor (reduced state of the acceptor), respectively. The Clebsch–Gordan coefficients (CSiMiSjMjSM) make the linear combination of the products of the isolated wavefunctions to be the eigenfunction of the total spin. The excited and charged states of the isolated donor and acceptor were calculated by means of the intermediate neglect of differential overlap (INDO) Hamiltonian29 coupled to a single configuration interaction (SCI) scheme. The active space consisted of 38 occupied orbitals and 22 virtual orbitals for D18, and 32 occupied orbitals and 24 virtual orbitals for Y6. The coulomb repulsion term is described by the Mataga–Nishimoto potential.30,31
Results and discussion
Geometries of single molecules and complexes
The torsion angle is 10.28° for the backbone of Y6 (Fig. S3†). For D18, the two repeating units show similar geometries with comparable torsion angles (Fig. S5a†). For the left repeating unit, the dihedral angle is 26.1° between the electron-donating (BDT) unit and adjacent thiophene bridge (T) in the main chain, and about 13° between the DTBT and T units. Moreover, the dihedral angles are about 56° between the BDT and side thiophene units. For the optimized D18/Y6 complex configuration (Fig. 1), the end group of Y6 is located in the electron-donating regions around the slightly bent DTBT of D18 with a remarkably short interatomic distance of 3.104 Å. Due to the rotation of the backbone of Y6, the central unit of Y6 approaches the side thiophene of the middle BDT unit of D18. Compared with isolated molecules, the torsion angle is reduced by about 6° for Y6 in the complex. The dihedral angles for D18 are increased in the main chain and decreased in the side chain. In addition, we have taken into account more accessible complex geometries by exerting translation along the x (dx), y (dy), and z-axis (dz), and rotation (θ) around the z-axis on Y6 from the optimized geometry and computed their single-point energies. When the difference between the single-point and optimized energies is smaller than 50 meV, the values of dx, dy, dz, and θ are determined to be in the range of −0.3–0.3 Å, −0.28–0.3 Å, −0.1–0.12 Å, and −1.6–1.2°, respectively (Fig. S6†).
 Fig. 1  Optimized D18/Y6 complex geometry. The displacements along the x, y, and z-axis (dx, dy, and dz) and rotation angle θ for Y6 are also illustrated. 
Coulomb energies and excited-state energy alignments
The Coulomb energies (ECoul) for CT states can be calculated by the following expression:32 (5)here qd and qa are the partial charges on atom d of the donor cation and atom a of the acceptor anion, respectively, which are obtained by an INDO Mulliken population analysis; rda is the distance between atoms d and a; ε0 and ε are dielectric constants of the vacuum and medium (set to 4.0), respectively.

Fig. 2 shows the calculated ECoul for the CT0 state as well as the excited CT states originating from the excitation of the charged states of D18 (CT1D and CT2D) or Y6 (CT1A and CT2A). Obviously, the CT1D state exhibits the weakest Coulomb energies, and the CT1A state has nearly the same values as those of the CT0 state. For the optimized complex geometry, the ECoul values are −0.282, −0.254, −0.281, −0.267, and −0.271 eV for the CT0, CT1D, CT1A, CT2D, and CT2A states, respectively, which are relatively smaller than those of typical polythiophene/PDI and DTDCTB/C60 complexes.32,33 As expected, ECoul is dependent on the interfacial geometries. The Coulomb energies can be changed by 10 meV when translating Y6, but are barely changed when rotating Y6.
 Fig. 2  Coulomb energies of the CT0, CT1D, CT1A, CT2D, and CT2A states as a function of dx, dy, dz, and θ for the D18/Y6 complex. 
In the first-order approximation, the energy of the CT0 state can be evaluated as the sum of the ionization potential (IP) of the donor, electron affinity (EA) of the acceptor, and Coulomb energies between the cationic donor and anionic acceptor:28,32 ECT0 = IP + EA + ECoul(6)
The energies of the higher-lying CT1D, CT1A, CT2D, and CT2A states are estimated by further adding the excitation energies of the related excited-charged states of the donor or acceptor. The calculated and experimental values of IP and EA are shown in Table 1. The B3LYP calculated IP of D18 compare well with the experimental value, but it is underestimated by the tuned ωB97XD functional and overestimated by INDO by a few tenths of eV. All the calculated results overestimate the EA of Y6 significantly. Here, the experimental IP and EA values are used to estimate the energies of the CT states. The calculated CT energies are shown in Fig. S7.† From CT0 to the higher-lying CT1D, CT1A, CT2D, and CT2A states, the energies are 1.128, 1.377, 1.504, 1.729, and 1.942 eV for the optimized configuration, respectively. Due to the small difference in ECoul, different configurations exhibit close energies for any CT state. That is, the CT-state energies vary by <10 meV for the translational configurations and hardly change for the rotational configurations.

The excitation energies for the lowest singlet excited state (S1) of D18 and Y6 are also listed in Table 1. From the maximum absorption, the S1 excitation energies in solution and film are determined to be 2.123 and 2.134 eV for D18 and 1.696 and 1.510 eV for Y6, respectively.12,16 Generally, all the calculated results compare well with the experimental measurements for both D18 and Y6. Following the molecular photo-excitation, the S1 excitons will relax to the lowest vibrational state promptly before dissociating into the CT state.34 Thus, the initial states for ED processes are considered to be the adiabatic S1 states, the energies of which are approximately equal to the optical bandgap in film (1.984 and 1.332 eV for D18 and Y6, respectively). According to the above results, the interfacial energy level alignment is described in Fig. 3 by taking the optimized configuration as an example. It can be found that the S1 excitons of Y6 can only dissociate into the CT0 state from the energy point of view. Interestingly, besides the CT0 state, the CT1D, CT1A, CT2D, and CT2A states are also lying below the S1 state of D18, suggesting that the S1 excitons of D18 can dissociate via multiple higher-lying CT states.
 Fig. 3  Interfacial excited-state energy level alignment for the optimized D18/Y6 complex geometry. Note: this situation is suitable for all configurations. 
When the entropy contribution is neglected, the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) can be estimated as the energy difference between the S1 state of D18 (S1D) and CT states for dissociation of D18 excitons, and between the S1 state of Y6 (S1A) and CT0 state for dissociation of Y6 excitons. It should be pointed out that higher-lying CT excitons will relax to the CT0 state before decaying to the ground state. Therefore, ΔG for the CR process is just the opposite value of the CT0 energy, resulting in a large driving force of about −1.12 eV (Fig. S8†). Regardless of the ED or CR process, ΔG exhibits little changes with the displacement and rotation of Y6. On the whole, ΔG is around −0.204 eV for dissociation of Y6 excitons and around −0.856, −0.607, −0.480, −0.255, and −0.042 eV for dissociation of D18 excitons into the CT0, CT1D, CT1A, CT2D, and CT2A states, respectively.
Electronic couplings
The electronic couplings are calculated for CR processes (VCR) from the CT0 to S0 state, and for the dissociation of Y6 excitons into the CT0 states (VS1A) and of D18 excitons into the CT0 (VS1D), CT1D (VCT1D), CT1A (VCT1A), CT2D (VCT2D), and CT2A (VCT2A) states (Fig. 4). As expected, the electronic couplings are much dependent on the interfacial geometries. Unfortunately, VCR can reach as large as 50 meV, and surpass the electronic couplings for all ED processes. VS1A are much stronger than the electronic couplings for dissociation of D18 excitons; the latter are all lower than 10 meV. Mostly, VS1D are comparable with the electronic couplings involving the excited CT states. The electronic couplings continuously decrease with dz, and barely change with θ. As dy increases, the electronic couplings for dissociation of D18 excitons decrease while VCR and VS1A increase, which is opposite to the trends as a function of dx.

Reorganization energies

λ includes two parts of internal (λint) and external (λext) contributions. λint corresponds to the geometry change of the isolated donor and acceptor, and can be determined from their individual adiabatic potential surfaces. For dissociation of D18 excitons, λint consists of the relaxation energies of D18 from the S1D to the cationic geometry and of Y6 from the S0 to the anionic geometry. Similarly, λint for the dissociation of Y6 excitons can be evaluated. In addition, λint for CR is estimated to be the total relaxation energies of D18 from the cationic to S0 geometry and of Y6 from the anionic to S0 geometry. The calculated relaxation energies are collected in Table 2.

The backbone of the S0 geometry exhibits much larger dihedral angles than those of the cationic geometry in D18 (Fig. S5†) resulting in relatively large relaxation energies. However, to a large extent, the dihedral angles of the S1 geometry are similar to those of the cationic geometry, which are beneficial for small relaxation energies. When the S0 state of D18 is involved, the relaxation energies for CR and ED are 0.078 and 0.095 eV, respectively, which are significantly larger than the relaxation energy (0.036 eV) for ED involving S1D. λint values of Y6 are similar for ED and CR because of the relatively rigid backbone originating from its fused structure. Therefore, the internal reorganization energies are 0.108 and 0.169 eV for the dissociation of D18 and Y6 excitons and 0.155 eV for the CR process, respectively.

λ
ext originates from the electronic and nuclear polarization of the surrounding medium. But it is very difficult to estimate λext accurately, although much effort (such as QM/MM for oligoacene,35 polarizable force field for poly/oligoacene and C60,36–38 and classical dielectric continuum model for oligophenylenevinylene–perylene bisimide complexes39) has been made. Thus, λext is set to a variable of 0.06–0.2 eV to obtain more reliable results in this work.40
Exciton-dissociation and charge-recombination rates
Based on the estimated Gibbs free energies, reorganization energies, and electronic couplings discussed above, the charge-transfer rates are calculated for the CR process from the CT0 to S0 state (kCR) and the ED process from the S1A to CT0 state (kS1A) as well as from the S1D to CT0 (kS1D), CT1D (kCT1D), CT1A (kCT1A), CT2D (kCT2D), and CT2A (kCT2A) states (Fig. 5 and S9†). As ΔG < 0, the rates will reach the maximum values when the absolute values of ΔG approach λ.
 Fig. 5  Evolution of the rates (s−1) for charge recombination (kCR) from CT0 to S0 and exciton dissociation from the S1 state of Y6 to CT0 (kS1A), and from the S1 state of D18 to CT1D (kCT1D), CT1A (kCT1A), CT2D (kCT2D), and CT2A (kCT2A) states as a function of dx, dy, dz, and θ for the D18/Y6 complex. 
For the dissociation of the S1D excitons, kS1D, kCT1D, and kCT1A continuously increase with λext because of the reduced difference between ΔG and λ. kS1D are limited by large driving forces, and their maximum values are only 107–108 s−1. Owing to smaller driving forces, kCT1D and kCT1A for most cases can reach ∼1011 and ∼1012 s−1, respectively, much higher than kS1D. Because ΔG is comparable with λint, kCT2D firstly increase and then decrease with λext. Despite further reduced driving forces, the upper limit of kCT2D is also 1011 s−1 due to weaker electronic couplings. Generally, kCT2A is comparable with kCT2D and continuously decreases with λext because of a very small ΔG.

k
S1A for the S1A exciton dissociation shows the same trend as kCT2A. Owing to much stronger electronic couplings and more suitable ΔG, kS1A can reach as large as 1013 s−1, which are several orders of magnitude higher than the ED rates for S1D excitons. Meanwhile, kCR increases continuously with λext. Although the CR process has the strongest electronic couplings, kCR is mostly lower than 106 s−1 because of the high energies of the CT0 state and small relaxation energies.
In summary, Y6 excitons can be only dissociated into the CT0 state, but at very high rates. However, D18 excitons will be dissociated into higher-lying CT states much more efficiently than the CT0 state. Importantly, the CR rates are several orders of magnitude lower than the ED rates. These results indicate that high yields of charge generation can be achieved under small driving forces in the D18/Y6 solar cells.41 This underlines the importance of multi-channel exciton dissociation for achieving high-efficiency organic photovoltaics.
Conclusions
In order to understand the excellent photovoltaic performance of D18/Y6-based organic solar cells, we have investigated the interfacial energy levels and charge-transfer (CT) processes for the D18/Y6 complexes. The calculated results show that the Y6 exictons will only dissociate into the CT0 state, but very efficiently at a high rate of 1013 s−1. For the D18 excitons, they can dissociate into the higher-lying CT1D, CT1A, CT2D, and CT2A states more efficiently (1010–1012 s−1) than into the CT0 state (107–108 s−1). Meanwhile, the CR rates are mostly lower than 106 s−1, which are several orders of magnitude lower than the ED rates. These results indicate low recombination probability and highly efficient exciton dissociations via multiple channels and provide useful insight into the high photovoltaic efficiencies of the D18/Y6 blend and other NF-OSCs based on A–D–A SMAs.
