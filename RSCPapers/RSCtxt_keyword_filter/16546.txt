    , Accepted 9th March 2012First published on 5th April 2012AbstractFountain pen ink possesses a well-dispersed nature and a relatively large specific surface area of carbon nanoparticles. In the present study, fountain pen ink was systematically studied and developed as cost-efficient counter electrodes (CEs) for planar dye-sensitized solar cells and fiber-shaped DSSCs (FDSSCs), which showed power conversion efficiencies above 6% under AM1.5G (100 mW cm−2). For ink-based planar solar cells, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) confirmed that ink CEs had a slightly lower charge-transfer resistance than platinum CEs. EIS also proved that adding TiO2 nanoparticles into the ink could reduce the device's series resistance and the diffusion impedance of the electrolyte through electrode pores. For ink-based FDSSCs, the effects of film thickness, light intensities, and a comparative research of CE catalytic activities toward various electrolytes were discussed.
Introduction
Photovoltaic technology has been recognized as an effective way to solve the current energy and environmental crisis.1,2 After two decades of concentrated efforts, the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) has been developed into a powerful photovoltaic technology because of its high efficiency and simple preparation process,3,4 with a recorded efficiency of 12.3%.5 A typical DSSC consists of three parts: a dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, an electrolyte with a I3−/I− redox couple, and a highly catalytic counter electrode (CE).6 A monolayer of dye molecules anchored on the TiO2 semiconductor experiences photoexcitation and then injects electrons into the conduction band of TiO2. Subsequently, the sensitizer is restored to the original state by electron donation from the I− species, which are regenerated in turn via the reduction of I3− species at the counter electrode.7,8 Hence, the CE plays important roles in balancing the electrolyte species and obtaining an effective output cycle.
Thus far, a platinum (Pt) catalyst is still the most efficient and widely used CE material toward I3−/I− electrolytes.9 However, Pt is scarce and expensive, which are significant hindrances for its use in the commercialization and wide application of DSSCs. Therefore, lots of researches have focused on low cost alternative materials with comparable catalytic performance to Pt. Pt-free materials that serve as efficient CEs include three categories: carbon materials (activated carbon, graphite, carbon black, carbon nanotube, graphene, etc.);10–15 conducting polymers (PEDOT, polyaniline, polypyrrol, etc.);16–18 and sulfides, oxides, carbides, and nitrides of transition metals (CoS, NiO, WC, MoN, etc.).19–22
Due to their abundant sources, corrosion resistance, and suitability for mass production, catalytic carbon materials have received extensive attention among these three categories.23 Moreover, carbon materials exhibit superior electrochemical activity compared to Pt and demonstrate significant potential in photoelectrochemical cells with non-iodine redox systems such as S2−/Sx2−,24 disulfide/thiolate (T2/T−),25 or cobalt-redox mediators.26 For a porous carbon CE, porosity is often related to its catalytic activity, that is, higher porosity may contribute to higher efficiency.23 However, high porosity may also increase the swelling of the carbon film and reduce the long-term stability of device. An appropriate porosity is therefore essential to achieve optimum device performance. In addition, to gain the desired catalytic performance, carbon CEs nowadays have film thicknesses up to several tens of micrometers.10,12,27,28 A thick carbon film will increase the device's internal resistance, which is harmful to the DSSCs' fill factor (FF) and efficiency when the thickness exceeds certain values.10,29 Also, attaining flexible and mechanically stable carbon electrodes with thick carbon films is difficult. Fountain pen ink, a common substance used for writing, has advantages such as mature industrialized technology and eco-friendliness.30 This substance has a highly uniform dispersion of nanoparticles and can remain stable for years. Interestingly, fountain pen ink can be applied using a variety of wet processing methods like spraying, immersion, scratch, spin-coating, and so on. As ready-made fountain pen ink has been adopted to fabricate DSSC CEs, no extra additives and ball milling are needed, as reported previously,23,27,31 thus resulting in a simplified process and reduced costs.
In this paper, fountain pen ink was directly introduced as the CEs and was first systematically studied from planar DSSCs (PDSSCs) to fiber-shaped DSSCs (FDSSCs). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Raman spectra were respectively used to understand the film morphology and microstructure of the ink nanoparticles. An ink film prepared via spin-coating onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) was shown to be only 3 μm thick. After adding a certain amount of TiO2 into ink, a power conversion efficiency (η, 100 mW cm−2) of 6.17% was achieved for PDSSC while that of Pt CE-based PDSSC was 6.75%. EIS analyses of dummy cells were conducted in detail to elucidate the electrochemical catalysis and diffusion properties of ink CEs compared with those of Pt CE. To improve the FF and attenuate the diffusion limitation in PDSSCs, ink was then extended to cost-efficient FDSSCs based on highly conductive stainless steel (SS) wire and carbon fiber (CF) substrates. The influence of ink film thickness on device performance, the light intensity dependencies, and the catalytic activities of ink and Pt electrodes toward the I3−/I− and T2−/T− electrolytes were discussed.
Experimental
Materials and their pretreatments
Fountain pen ink in this study was carbon black ink and used as purchased (Hero, Shanghai Ink Factory, China). FTO glasses were rinsed in an ultrasonic bath of detergent, isopropanol alkaline solution, and ethanol in sequence. Ti wires (Alfa Aesar, diameter φ = 0.250 mm) were ultrasonically cleaned with acetone, isopropanol, and ethanol for 15 min each successively. SS (φ = 0.250 mm) wires and CF bundles (Toray, M40JB) were washed with acetone. Pt wires (φ = 80 μm) were used as purchased. Ink-TiO2 blend paste was made by dispersing 20wt% TiO2 pre-colloids into ink with intense stirring and ultrasonication.
Preparation of TiO2 photoanode
TiO2 film with an approximately thickness of 10 μm was prepared on FTO by screen-printing via a reported method.25 TiO2 colloids were prepared according to a modified process:32 12.0 ml tetrabutyl titanate (Aldrich) and 2.0 ml acetic acid were mixed followed by vigorous stirring. The mixture was added slowly into 60.0 ml water and then 0.5 ml 65% nitric acid was added into the system followed by stirring for 2 h in an oil bath at 80 °C. Next, 35 ml of the mixture was transferred into the autoclave and left undisturbed at 220 °C for 12 h. The mixture then underwent vigorous stirring and ultrasonic dispersion to form TiO2 pre-colloids. After part of the solvent was removed and 0.6 g PEG-20,000 and a drop of Triton X-100 were added, pre-TiO2 colloids were stirred to obtain the final TiO2 colloids. Ti wire-based photoanode was prepared through dip-coating TiO2 colloids on Ti wire using the procedures described earlier.33 Both above as-prepared FTO/TiO2 electrode and fibrous TiO2 electrode were immersed into 0.5 mM N719 (Solarnix) ethanol solution for 24 h to form the dye-sensitized photoanodes, namely, the planar TiO2 photoanodes and the fibrous TiO2 photoanodes.
Preparation of CE
Pt/FTO CE was prepared by magnetron sputtering Pt film (about 40 nm) on FTO. Ink/FTO CE (or ink-TiO2/FTO CE) was prepared by spin-coating ink (or ink-TiO2 blend paste) onto an FTO substrate to a desired thickness and dried at 120 °C. Ink/SS and ink/CF fibrous CEs were prepared via dip-coating and dried at 120 °C. The repetition times of dip-coating determine the thickness of ink film. All the above electrodes were then annealed at 350 °C for 30 min to produce the required ink CEs.
Device assembly
PDSSCs were achieved by assembling the FTO/TiO2 photoanodes and planar CEs (ink/FTO, ink-TiO2/FTO and Pt/FTO CEs) into sandwich-type cells, and then sealed and separated by 25 μm thick Surlyn film (Dupont). The cells were filled with I3−/I− electrolyte through capillary action (Device area: 0.25 cm2). FDSSCs were achieved by inserting the fibrous TiO2 photoanodes and CEs (ink/SS, ink/CF, Pt wire CEs) into a glass capillary (φinner ∼ 0.9 mm, φouter ∼ 1.2 mm) filled with I3−/I− electrolyte or T2/T− electrolyte. The two ends of the capillary were sealed with wax. The composition of I3−/I− electrolyte was as follows: 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M iodine, 0.3 M 4-tert-butylpyridine, 0.05 M lithium perchlorate, and 0.05 M guanidine thiocyanate in acetonitrile solution. The composition of T2/T− electrolyte was as follows: 0.4 M T2, 0.4 M T− (5-mercapto-1-methyltetrazole), 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 0.05 M lithium perchlorate in acetonitrile/ethylene carbonate (v/v = 6/4) solution.
Measurements

J–V curves and short-circuit current response of the devices were conducted on a Keithley Model 2000 through a solar simulator (Yamashita DESO, Japan). Selective filters were used for intensity dependence tests of ink/CF CE and Pt wire CE-based FDSSC. Light intensity was 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5 G) calibrated by a standard silicon cell unless specified otherwise. The aperture area of the FDSSCs was obtained from the projected area Ap, which was equivalent to the apparent diameter of the fibrous TiO2 photoanode multiplied by the length of the device.32–35 Surface morphology was observed by field-emission SEM (FE-SEM, S-4800 Hitachi). The microstructures of CF and ink were characterized by a Renishaw 1000 Raman spectrometer using a wavelength of 514.5 nm, and the detector integration time was set at 120 s. The specific surface area of ink nanoparticles was determined using the BET method (ASAP 2010, Micrometer). CV analyses were performed using a three-electrode setup with Pt as the CE, AgCl/Ag as the reference electrode, and target electrode as the working electrode at a potential scan rate of 50 mV s−1. EIS of dummy cells were carried out through PGSTAT302N (Autolab Corp., Switzerland), with 10 mV perturbation and 0.5 Hz to 100 kHz frequency range.
Results and discussion
Device structures, morphology of ink-based CEs, and Raman characterization

Fig. 1 illustrates the device structures of ink CE-based PDSSCs (left) and FDSSCs (right). Note that PDSSC is front-illuminated and FDSSC is back-illuminated when tested due to different device architectures. The SEM images in Fig. 2a–c show that the ink film is composed of nanoparticles with a grain size of approximately 20 nm. The influence of processing temperature on the morphology of ink film was investigated. As shown in Fig. 2a,b, the ink film has slightly smaller and relatively well-distributed micropores after annealing at 350 °C. When TiO2 nanoparticles were added, the ink–TiO2 composite film (Fig. 2c) showed optimized morphology because some irregular pores were reduced and the connectivity of ink nanoparticles was improved. Generally, porosity and pore distribution of carbon film electrodes are important factors that affect catalytic activity and device performance,9,36 which will be discussed later. The cross-sectional view (Fig. 2d) reveals that the spin-coated ink film with a thickness of around 3 μm is smooth and homogeneous (inset), and is much thinner than previously reported carbon film CEs.27,37Fig. 2e illustrates the ink/CF fibrous CE and Fig. 2f presents the corresponding Raman spectra, which had two characteristic bands: the D-band (peak at 1355 cm−1, attributed to the disordered carbonaceous component) and the G-band (peak at 1585 cm−1, attributed to the ordered graphitic component). A calculated R-value (the intensity ratio of D-band to G-band) of 0.902 indicated that a considerable number of graphite crystallites exist in the disordered ink carbon film, which might enhance conductivity.38 From this finding, a better understanding could be gained about the microstructure of nanoscale ink.

JV and EIS performance of Ink CE-based PDSSCs
With Pt CE-based PDSSC (P1) fabricated as a comparison, we fabricated ink CE-based PDSSC (P2) and ink-TiO2 CE-based PDSSC (P3). Current density–voltage (J–V) curves under standard illumination (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. S1a†, and detailed photovoltaic parameters of P1, P2, and P3 are summarized in Table 1. P2 gained 80% efficiency (η = 5.42%) of that of P1 (η = 6.75%). Compared to P2, P3 obtained better performance (open-circuit voltage Voc = 733 mV, short-circuit current density Jsc = 15.38 mA cm−2, FF = 0.548, η = 6.17%), which was close to that of P1. The relatively high Jsc of P1 mainly originates from the surface reflection of Pt film.39 P2 and P3 had higher Voc than P1, consistent with reported conclusions based on carbon CEs.10 By studying the short-circuit current–time response of P1, P2, and P3 (Fig. S1b†), ink CE-based devices were found to share similar response behavior and stability with the Pt CE-based one. The initial results indicated that fountain pen ink can act as an effective CE for DSSCs, and device performance can be improved by the addition of TiO2.

To explore how CEs influence the photovoltaic performance, EIS measurements were performed using dummy cells comprising two identical CEs, which is recognized as an effective way to eliminate interferences and evaluate the electrochemical properties of CEs.9 The inset of Fig. 3b reveals a conventional equivalent circuit (A) used to fit the experimental data of Pt dummy cell (S1). Generally, Rs is the ohmic series resistance; Rct and Q are the charge-transfer resistance and capacitance at the CE/electrolyte interface, respectively; and O is the diffusion impedance (used here to characterize the finite length diffusion). Fig. 3a shows the Nyquist plots of ink dummy cell tested from 0 V to 0.8 V, with two semicircles at low biases and a third semicircle becoming obvious as the bias increases. The figure shows that the first semicircle did not change much, the second semicircle weakened, and the third semicircle became more prominent. Aksay and coworkers found a similar rule using functionalized graphene CE.15 Drawing from their findings, we presented a modified equivalent circuit (B), as shown in the inset of Fig. 3b. Combining the circuit with Nyquist plots, Rs can be determined from the onset of the first semicircle (∼50 kHz); O′ represented the diffusion impedance through electrode pores and gave rise to the first semicircle (50–1 kHz); Rct and Q corresponded to the second semicircle (1 kHz–10 Hz) and O′′ represented the bulk diffusion impedance and gave rise to the third semicircle (<10 Hz). The derived EIS parameters are listed in Table 1. The ink dummy cell (S2) had a higher Rs (15.8 Ω) than S1 (Rs: 6.44 Ω), which mainly accounted for the relatively low FF of P2. After adding TiO2, the Rs of the ink–TiO2 dummy cell (S3) dropped down to 10.8 Ω, which is ascribed to improved conductivity and firm bonding to substrate because of the TiO2 binder.38,40 Both S2 and S3 exhibited comparably low Rct to that of S1; the ink CE even owned a slightly lower Rct compared with that of the Pt CE. Low Rct of the ink CEs was expected to result in high catalytic activity and compensate for the adverse effect of higher Rs in order to achieve excellent photovoltaic performance. However, as displayed in Fig. 3b, the O′′ of S2 and S3 were apparently larger compared with O of S1. This result is reasonable because the Pt catalyst always demonstrates superior bulk diffusion properties than usual carbon catalysts.15,41 Besides, both S2 and S3 exhibited additional diffusion impedance through electrode pores (O′), which resulted in increased internal resistance and thus reduced FF and device efficiency. The introduction of TiO2 can also lower O′, showing agreement with better connectivity of ink nanoparticles for efficient catalysis and improved performance for P3. The above results implied that electrolyte diffusion limitation may be another critical factor affecting the device performance of ink CE-based PDSSCs. Pore size and pore distribution of the nanocarbon CE are thus very important to balance electrolyte diffusion and long-term stability of the device.

Cost-efficient FDSSCs with ink CEs on various substrates
Cheap ink can be easily processed into efficient PDSSCs, and thus shows great potential in reducing the cost and simplifying the manufacturing process of solar cells. Recently, fiber-shaped solar cells have aroused increasing interest as a consequence of their many advantages such as TCO-free, three-dimensional (3-D) light-harvesting ability, and potential flexibility toward woven electronics.32,33,42,43 To improve the device FF and to make ink-based solar cells more cost-effective, ink was applied into FDSSCs with highly conductive SS wires and CFs as substrates instead of expensive FTOs. Furthermore, our FDSSCs can be well assembled by capillary filling with plenty of electrolytes, which may benefit the diffusion of electrolyte species into the ink CEs and thus achieve a more active catalytic cycle.33Fig. 5a presents the J–V characteristics of ink/SS CE-based FDSSCs with different ink film thickness. Film thickness will influence the catalytic surface area and the Rs in an opposite way,10,29 causing corresponding changes in FF and η (Fig. S2†). The best photovoltaic performance was attained when the ink film thickness was 15 μm, with Voc = 715 mV, Jsc = 12.15 mA cm−2, FF = 0.712, and η = 6.18%. The FF for ink-based FDSSCs was much higher than the FF for ink-based PDSSCs, consistent with our earlier speculation. Moreover, owing to the 3-D light-harvesting ability of fiber solar cells,32,33 energy output can be doubled with a diffuse reflector at the bottom of the device (Fig. S3†). BET test showed that ink nanoparticles had a large specific surface area of 177.5 m2 g−1. A larger specific surface area is usually believed to contribute to increased exchange current density and more excellent catalytic activity.36 This relation is proven through cyclic voltammogram (CV) characteristics in Fig. 4a, where both ink/SS and Pt wire electrodes showed prominent redox peaks toward I3−/I− catalysis. Ink/SS CE had even higher redox current density than Pt wire, indicating its superior catalytic ability than Pt wire, and produced the above mentioned highly efficient FDSSC. Additionally, the annealing effect of ink film on device performance was studied. As shown in Fig. 5a and Table S1†, the ink/SS CE-based FDSSC with ink film annealed at 350 °C had higher FF (0.641) and η (5.39%) compared with those of the FDSSC with ink film processed at 120 °C (FF = 0.600; η = 5.01%). The specific surface area of ink nanoparticles processed at 120 °C was also examined and a BET result of 32.8 m2 g−1 was found. By combining SEM morphologies (Fig. 2a, b), annealing is shown to be effective in removing excess additives to shape well-distributed pores and a larger specific surface area. As a result, ink/SS-CE annealed at 350 °C possessed better catalytic activity for obtaining higher device performance.

Industrialized CF is made of CF monofilaments, and thus has the advantage of a relatively larger specific surface area than common bulky materials.35 To further enhance the catalytic ability, ink CE was prepared on CF substrate and the FDSSCs was subsequently built with this all-carbon CE (Dink/CF). Pt wire CE-based FDSSCs (DPt wire) were also assembled. The light intensity dependencies of Dink/CF and DPt wire were then studied, and the results are illustrated in Fig. 5b, c and Table S2†. As the light intensity varied, Jsc values for Dink/CF and DPt wire were linearly varied with a similar change in slope. This variation is easy to understand because the photocurrent of solar cells linearly depends on light flux and basically has no connection with the CEs. Voc of Dink/CF and DPt wire showed an exponential decrease with lowered light intensity owing to its logarithmically proportional relationship to Jsc.6Voc of Dink/CF also had greater dependence on light intensity and higher values than those of DPt wire under strong light irradiation. From Fig. 5c, FF values of Dink/CF and DPt wire were linearly increased as the light intensity decreased. In the current study, FF of Dink/CF demonstrated lower dependence on light intensity and was higher than that of DPt wire under higher light intensities. Consequently, Dink/CF yielded comparable or even higher efficiencies than DPt wire. It suggested that ink CE-based FDSSCs may work quite well under strong illumination and be superior to Pt CE-based ones.
Due to the higher activity of ink/CF CE for catalyzing the redox reaction of I3−/I− as compared with Pt wire electrode (Fig. 4a), ink/CF CE-based FDSSC had better performance than Pt CE-based FDSSC (Fig. 5d and Table S3†). Besides, the ink electrode showed better stability than Pt electrode upon electrochemical cycling (Fig. S5†). However, for typical I3−/I−-based electrolytes, there remained problems such as light absorption by triiodide, electrolyte corrosion, and relatively high overpotential for dye regeneration.44 Light loss became a more serious problem in back-illuminated DSSCs.35 To address this issue, the ink CE was extended to a non-iodine system. That is, a T2/T− redox couple-based electrolyte, which has negligible absorption in the visible spectral range.45 According to the CV for T2/T− of three electrodes (Pt, ink/SS, and ink/CF electrodes, Fig. 4b), Pt showed a little reduction peak while ink/SS electrode showed an apparent reduction peak. The high catalysis could be ascribed to the ink film because SS did not have any catalytic activity and mainly acted as a current collector. When SS wire was replaced with CF substrate having a larger specific surface area, the ink/CF electrode exhibited even higher redox current, implying its further improved catalytic ability toward T2/T−. In conformity with above CV results, the ink/CF CE-based FDSSC with T2/T− electrolyte acquired a 17% higher FF (0.758) and 22% higher efficiency (4.05%) compared to Pt CE-based FDSSC (FF = 0.646, η = 3.33%). These results indicated that the highly catalytic ink-based CE is more advantageous than Pt-based CE in achieving efficient T2/T−-based photovoltaics.
Conclusions
Nanoscale fountain pen ink was utilized directly for CEs to prepare efficient PDSSCs and FDSSCs. Annealing and adding a TiO2 binder to the ink can improve the morphology of ink film, which helps electrolyte species diffuse into CE films and results in better device performance. Our results suggested that ink can be a highly cost-efficient alternative to Pt in many aspects through its high catalytic activity toward multiple electrolytes, good adhesion to various substrates, and suitability for large-scale manufacturing of electronic devices via ink-jet printing technology. Besides, the cost of commercial ink is a thousand times lower than that of Pt. Common ink is especially promising in developing low-cost, flexible, non-planar photovoltaics with high energy output. Further efforts in the surface functionalization of ink particles and better understanding of the electrolyte diffusion mechanism for fiber-shaped solar cells or to expand the ink to non-volatile ionic liquid system-based DSSCs are in progress.
