    First published on 16th June 2017AbstractLanthanide-doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are promising for applications as wide as biological imaging, multimodal imaging, photodynamic therapy, volumetric displays, and solar cells. Yet, the weak and narrow absorption of lanthanide ions poses a fundamental limit of UCNPs to withhold their brightness, creating a long-standing hurdle for the field. Dye-sensitized UCNPs are emerging to address this performance-limiting problem, yielding up to thousands-fold brighter luminescence than conventional UCNPs without dye sensitization. In their configuration, organic dyes with spectrally broad and intense absorption are anchored to the surface of UCNPs to harvest the excitation light energy, which is then transferred via Förster and/or Dexter mechanisms across the organic/inorganic interface to the lanthanides incorporated in UCNPs (with or devoid of a shell) to empower efficient upconversion. This tutorial review highlights recent progress in the development of dye sensitized UCNPs, with an emphasis on the theory of energy transfer, the geometric classification of the dye sensitized core and core/shell nanocrystals, and their emerging photonic and biophotonic applications. Opportunities and challenges offered by dye sensitized UCNPs are also discussed.

1. Introduction
Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are dilute guest–host nanosystems with a dimension of less than 100 nm, in which trivalent lanthanide ions, possessing a ladder-like hierarchy of long-lived electronic energy levels, are incorporated in an appropriate dielectric host lattice.1,2 They are able to emit ultraviolet, visible or near infrared (NIR) upconversion luminescence (UCL) when excited, typically in the NIR range, through sequentially absorbed two or more low-energy quanta via intermediate long-lived electronic states to populate higher-lying electronic states. UCNPs have distinct advantages over other luminescent materials employed in biological applications (i.e., organic dyes, fluorescent proteins and quantum dots), such as spectrally distinct and narrow emission, non-blinking, and unique photostability. Owing to the large anti-Stokes shift of UCL, the use of UCNPs in bioimaging eliminates the autofluorescence background, creating high contrast images. Due to their exceptional optical properties, UCNPs have attracted broad interest in research areas such as bio-sensing, nanothermometry, drug delivery, and photodynamic therapy; they are also employed for solar cells and displays.3
Despite promising results recently achieved on precise composition engineering and purpose-tailored size, shape, and emission bands, the low brightness of UCL still restricts the practical applications of UCNPs. Various methods have been attempted to alleviate this problem, for example by introducing a core/inert shell or core/active shell design, optimizing the lanthanide concentration, controlling the crystal phase of the host lattice, tailoring the local crystal field around the doped lanthanide ions, as well as by plasmonic upconversion enhancement.3–5 These methods allow enhancing upconversion by one to three orders of magnitude through controlling directional energy transfer within the UCNPs6 or spatial management of excitation power density around the UCNPs.5 However, the weak and narrow-band NIR absorption of UCNPs remains intact, which caps their photon harvesting capability, and thus suppresses the UCL output substantively.7,8 This fundamental limit is mainly associated with the nature of the 4f–4f electronic transitions of the doped lanthanide ions. Typically, UCNPs employ doped Yb3+ ions (sensitizers) to absorb infrared radiation and nonradiatively transfer the excitation to the doped lanthanide activators X3+ (X = Er, Ho, or Tm) to produce visible or ultraviolet UCL. Yet, the sensitizer ion Yb3+ absorbs light in a narrow spectral window of ∼10260–10660 cm−1 (∼10 times narrower than that of an organic dye), and with a critically small absorption cross-section of ∼10−20 cm2 (∼1000–10000 times lower than that of a dye molecule, ∼10−17–10−16 cm2).8 This fundamental limitation impedes UCNPs in broadly harvesting infrared (IR) light and producing bright UCL.
Drawing inspiration from lanthanide coordination complexes that utilize the coordinating organic compounds to sensitize lanthanide luminescence,9 dye sensitized upconversion has emerged in recent years as a new dimension, employing organic dyes as antennae to enhance the brightness of UCNPs.7,8,10,11 It has been shown that dye antennae can enhance the UCL brightness of the state of the art core/shell UCNPs (∼30–50 nm in diameter) by 20–100 times,8,12,13 and by ∼3300 times for sub-20 nm UCNPs without an inert shell passivation.7 Taking into account the merits of organic dyes, such as their tunable optical properties, availability of mature synthetic techniques, and well-established functionalization methods, they possess grand potential for enhancing the UCL brightness of different upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP) formulations through improvement of their light-harvesting ability. Moreover, organic dyes can be engineered to be attached to the surface of UCNPs through covalent bonding, electrostatic attraction, physical absorption or combination of those; antenna dyes can also be combined to co-sensitize UCNPs with a precisely defined absorption spectrum, providing new opportunities to boost UCL brightness.
In this review, we provide insights into the Förster- and/or Dexter-type energy transfer processes, which occur across the organic/inorganic and the inorganic/shell interfaces and allow for the Ln–Ln (e.g., sensitizer–activator) interactions. We also shed light on recent results on dye-sensitized core-only and core/shell UCNPs, highlight their applications profiting from enhanced UCL brightness, and cast a look at their future development.
2. Non-radiative energy transfer processes
The processes of nonradiative energy transfer play a critical role in the phenomenon of photon upconversion in lanthanide-doped luminescent materials, allowing the excitation energy to migrate, split and accumulate through the ladder-like electronic energy levels of trivalent lanthanide ions, thus enabling purpose-tailored luminescent pathways. Along with the energy transfer between Ln–Ln ions (4f–4f electronic interactions), the NIR organic dye sensitization adds a new fundamental dimension for nonradiative energy transfer, exploiting the interaction between the singlet or triplet states of organic dyes and the 4f electronic states of Ln ions. The nonradiative energy transfers from dyes to lanthanide ions and between lanthanide ions (e.g., from the lanthanide sensitizer to the lanthanide activator) can all be conceptualized as the transfer from an energy donor (D) to an acceptor (A). As a result, here we first show a fundamental view of donor–acceptor energy transfer through Förster and/or Dexter mechanisms, and then showcase their use to enable bright dye-sensitized UCNPs for various applications.
2.1. Förster and Dexter mechanisms
Nonradiative energy transfer between a donor (D) and an acceptor (A) generally originates from either electrostatic or exchange interactions.14,15 While exchange interactions are significant at shorter distances (∼10 Å or less), electrostatic interactions are usually non-negligible at longer distances (10–100 Å). A long-distance nonradiative energy transfer can be described using the dipole–dipole Förster energy transfer mechanism, in which D and A can be well presented as point dipoles.15 When the distance between the D and A moieties is comparable with their size, electric multipole interactions should also be considered.15,16 Exchange interactions manifest themselves mostly through the orbital overlap between D and A, which is non-negligible only at short distances,15–21 and can be described within the Dexter exchange coupling (DEC) mechanism.15,19 The Förster and Dexter mechanisms are schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. In the Förster mechanism, the donor nonradiatively relaxes its energy from the excited state (D*) to the ground state (D), while the acceptor accepts the energy and transits from the ground state (A) to the excited state (A*). In the Dexter mechanism, an exchange of the excited electron from D to A takes place, leading to singlet–singlet or triplet–triplet Dexter energy transfer. If the electronic transitions, involved by Förster and Dexter mechanisms, are dipole allowed, the electrostatic interactions usually prevail over the exchange interactions even at short distances, while the exchange interactions prevail over the electrostatic interactions at short distances in the cases when the electronic transitions in D and A are dipole forbidden.16,18,19 Electronic transitions in D and A can be spin allowed or spin forbidden. A singlet–singlet energy transfer can originate from both exchange and electrostatic interactions.16,18,19 By contrast, the triplet–triplet energy transfer originates from an exchange interaction, and can be described by the Dexter model involving a simultaneous exchange of two electrons of different spin between D and A.16 In general, the probability of nonradiative energy transfer between D and A is greater when the total spin of D + A is conserved.18,19
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustrations of (a) the Förster energy transfer process with electrostatic interactions enabling nonradiative transfer of the excitation energy from the donor to the acceptor, (b) Dexter energy transfer process involving a bilateral exchange of electrons between a donor and an acceptor, producing a spin-conserved singlet–singlet or triplet–triplet transfer. D and D* represent the ground and excited states of energy donor, while A and A* are the ground and excited states of energy acceptor. 
The probability of nonradiative energy transfer through electrostatic interactions can be derived using quantum theory, given as14 (1)where s = 6 for dipole–dipole interactions, s = 8 for dipole–quadrupole interactions and s = 10 for quadrupole–quadrupole interactions. R0 is the Förster radius, R is the distance between D and A, and τD is the lifetime of the excited states of D. For s = 6, the well-known formula for the dipole–dipole Förster mechanism is retained:14 (2)
In eqn (1) and (2) the Förster radius is the distance at which the energy transfer probability is equal to the probability of spontaneous deactivation of D. This parameter can be obtained from experimental spectroscopic data as:16–20 (3)where n is the refractive index of the environment, γD is the fluorescence quantum yield of D, NA is Avogadro's number, and J is the spectral overlap: (4)Here fD(λ) is the emission spectrum of the donor and εA(λ) is the absorption spectrum of the acceptor. The factor k depends on the dipole (D and A) orientation and equals  in isotropic media.14,15 Therefore, the probability of the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) depends on the spectral overlap of D and A and is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the D–A distance.
By contrast, the probability for the energy transfer via the Dexter mechanism exponentially depends on the distance and can be expressed by the formula:15 (5)Here, L is the sum of the van der Waals radii of the donor and the acceptor, J is the spectral overlap integral between the donor and the acceptor in eqn (4), and D is the so-called Dexter parameter, which, however, is hard to obtain using pure experimental spectroscopic parameters of the donor and acceptor.15,16,19 Note that both Förster and Dexter mechanisms depend on the spectral overlap integral J. Therefore, the smaller the energy gap between the excited states D* and A*, the greater the J value and the higher the energy transfer probability.19
2.2. Energy transfer between lanthanide ions
Typically, the electronic transitions of free Ln3+ ions are parity-forbidden within the electric dipole approximation. Therefore, only magnetic and quadruple electronic transitions are allowed for free Ln3+ ions.19,20 However, for lanthanide-doped materials, the asymmetrical and irregular crystal field of the host lattice (e.g., NaYF4) influences the electronic structure of Ln3+ ions. The odd components of the crystal field mix with the even components of the 4f electronic configuration, leading to partial allowance for the Laporte-forbidden electronic transitions. As a result, the energy transfer process between the Ln3+ ions in the lattice can be described by the Förster dipole–dipole interaction mechanism.8,12,19 Indeed, the long distance between Ln3+ ions (typically larger than 0.4 nm within the NaYF4 crystal lattice) and the shielding effect of the outer 5s and 5p electrons preclude the orbital overlap of 4f electrons, thus ruling out the mechanism of Dexter-type energy transfer. Moreover, the crystal field results in a weak splitting of energy levels of Ln3+ ions with a variation of ∼500–1000 cm−1, thus slightly broadening the emission and absorption spectral range of Ln3+ ions.12,19 As reviewed in the previous section, the probability of the energy transfer process is dependent on the Ln (D)–Ln (A) distance and the overlap spectral integral between the emission spectrum of D and the absorption spectrum of A. The spectral integral of sharp emission and absorption bands is considerable for resonant energy transfer, while, however, it becomes near-zero for an energy mismatch (ΔED*A*) larger than a few phonon energies of the host lattice (Fig. 2). For such cases, the electron–phonon (vibronic) coupling between the Ln3+ ions and the surrounding lattice environment should be taken into account. Along with the crystal-field-induced energy level splitting, this vibronic effect makes both of the pure narrow 4f–4f absorption and emission spectral bands broaden, thus increasing the spectral integral from near-zero to a significant value. The probability of such energy transfer processes can be estimated using the following formula:18,19 (6)where SD0 and SA0 are lattice coupling for each ion D and A, , WDA(0,0;E) is the zero-phonon overlap integral between the electronic bands, νm is the phonon cutoff frequency of the lattice. WDA(0,0;E) must be estimated for some hypothetical host system with ΔED*A* = 0. It should be noted that the estimation of WpaDA is a great challenge even using both experimental and theoretical methods. However, in many cases, a nonradiative energy transfer with a resonantly matched emission and absorption spectrum is more probable.19,22 Owing to the long-lived lifetime of the energy levels of Ln3+, the Förster-type transfer allows for random energy migration in the Ln–Ln network, pooling energy to the emitting Ln3+ activator sites or exciting the higher-lying energy states due to interactions of the neighboring Ln3+ ions.8,12,19 These features generate the phenomenon of photon upconversion with abundant, concentration-dependent, nonradiative energy transfer processes. Note that for the theoretical quantification of the energy transfer process, an accurate derivation of the electronic states of Ln3+ necessitates a balanced description of both electron correlation (the open f shell) and relativistic effects (e.g. four-component Dirac–Coulomb Hamiltonian and spin–orbit coupling).23,24

2.3. Energy transfer between dyes and surface lanthanide ions
Dye sensitized upconversion typically involves the use of organic dye molecules anchored on the nanoparticle surface to implement an antenna effect (see Fig. 3 and 4). After light exposure, the dye is activated to the excited singlet electronic state (S1), followed by several deactivation processes (Fig. 3): (i) radiationless internal conversion IC, (ii) intersystem crossing ISC (S1 → T1), (iii) luminescence radiation R (S1 → S0), and (iv) energy transfer to Ln3+ on the surface of lanthanide-doped nanoparticles.8 The energy transfer process (ET1) involves the relaxation of dye molecules to the ground state S0 and the activation of Ln3+ ions to their excited state (e.g., 4F7/2 → 4F5/2 of Yb3+ ions, a typical lanthanide sensitizer). If both transitions are dipole allowed, the energy transfer process is described within the Förster model, as reported in recent works.8,12 Note that multipolar electrostatic corrections beyond the dipole–dipole scheme were found to contribute only slightly to the energy transfer probability at a dye–Ln distance of 1–2 nm in real cases. If the ISC process is more efficient than ET1, the dye will then go to the triplet state (T1). A nonradiative energy transfer possibly occurs from the dye to Ln3+, involving a spin forbidden electronic transition (T1 → S0) of the dye and a concurrent excitation of the Ln3+ to the excited state. In this case, the corresponding energy transfer process (ET2) can be of both electrostatic and exchange nature, or either of them. At an estimated dye–Ln distance of 1–2 nm in reality, the exchange mechanism was usually found to be negligible or comparable with the Förster mechanism.18
 Fig. 3  A schematic illustration of nonradiative energy transfer processes from dye to Ln3+. R, IC, and ISC represent the luminescence radiation, internal conversion, and intersystem crossing, respectively. 
 Fig. 4  Schematic illustrations of dye sensitized upconversion in (a) the core (S: sensitizer, A: activator) and (b) the core–shell structure (S1: type 1 sensitizer; S2: type 2 sensitizer; A: activator). The solid red, dashed red, solid blue, and green arrows represent the excitation, the energy transfer, the upconverting pathway, and the luminescence process, respectively. The surface, the shell, and the core region have been highlighted by distinct colors for differentiation. 
It is important to note that the competition between ET1 and ET2 is governed by the photophysical parameters (i.e., the IC and ISC rate constants) of the dye and the interaction strength of the dye with the Ln3+ at its different excitation states. According to the Förster and Dexter models described in Section 2.1, these parameters are all sensitive to the involved energy gap, i.e., the ISC probability is in inverse proportion to the S1–T1 energy gap of the dye, the ET1 probability to the energy gap between the S1 (dye) and the excited state of Ln3+, and the probability of the ET2 process to the energy gap between the T1 (dye) and the excited state of Ln3+. Therefore, to characterize the energy transfer between the dye and the Ln3+ ions, the precise energy values of the excited singlet and triplet electronic states of the dye and their positions with respect to the electronic excited states of Ln3+ are required. These data can be procured using quantum chemistry. For example, recently, a quantum chemical simulation of the indocyanine green (ICG) dye was performed using the ab initio XMC-QDPT2 method, determining the energies of its excited singlet and triplet electronic states.12 According to the calculated results, it was revealed that the energy transfer from the ICG to the Yb3+ ion was dominated by the ET1 process from the S1 (ICG) to the 4F5/2 state of the Yb3+ ion.
To conclude, both Förster and Dexter models are needed to precisely describe the energy transfer processes between the Ln3+ ion and the dye. However, in many reported cases, the Förster model alone is sufficient to describe the energy transfer between Ln3+ and the dye, due to the higher rate of ET1 over the ISC rate.8,12,16 A detailed description of Förster can be implemented with the knowledge of the photophysical characteristics of the dye and electron–phonon interactions between Ln3+ and the lattice, which can be obtained by the combined use of the theoretical and experimental results.
3. Dye-sensitized UCNPs
Dye sensitized upconversion is typically realized for UCNPs of two geometries: (i) dye-sensitized core-only nanocrystals (Fig. 4a); (ii) dye-sensitized core/shell nanocrystals (Fig. 4b). Both structures involve the use of energy transfer from the NIR organic dyes attached to the nanocrystal surface to the sensitizer (S) lanthanide ions exposed on the nanocrystal surface as the first step of energy migration, i.e., the interaction of dyes with surface Ln3+ ions to permit the transfer of excitation energy across the organic/inorganic interface. For the dye-sensitized core-only nanocrystals, the excited sensitizer S (usually S = Yb) will then interact with the activator ions A (A = Er, Ho, and Tm) within the host lattice of the inorganic core to produce upconversion via the classical energy transfer upconversion (ETU) mechanism, whereby the sensitizer (S) successively transfers the harvested energy to a neighbouring activator ion (A), promoting A to its upper emitting state. The advantage of this dye-sensitized core-only structure is that the energy transportation from the organic dye to the S is straightforward; while the disadvantage is that both the S and A ions are exposed directly to the surrounding luminescence deactivators (surface defects, remaining ligands, solvents, etc). This manifests a strong surface-related quenching effect which can be 100–1000 times higher than that of the inorganic core/shell structure. For dye-sensitized core/shell nanocrystals, the energy transferred to the lanthanide sensitizer (S1) in the shell will migrate across the inorganic core/inorganic shell interface through the interaction of the lanthanide ion (S1) with the S2 sensitizer positioned in the core (S1–S2), and, finally, with the A activator also in the core to produce upconversion via the classical ETU mechanism. A hierarchical alignment of electronic energy levels (of the NIR dye, the intermediate sensitizer S1 in the shell, and the sensitizer S2 in the core) is needed to favor a unidirectional transfer of the harvested energy to the lanthanide activators in the core, preventing an inverse energy transfer that couples to the nanoparticle surface to decrease the UCL efficiency. Since a core/shell design spatially isolates the core from the environment, surface-related UCL quenching in the core is significantly suppressed by the shell. As a result, photon upconversion in dye-sensitized core/shell nanoparticles synergistically combines the merits of a core/shell nanocrystal structure and the “antenna” effect from the dye, producing ultrabright UCL under excitation in a broad spectral range.
3.1 Organic dyes for dye-sensitized upconversion
As shown in Table 1, most of the reported organic dyes utilized for sensitizing UCNPs are small NIR organic molecules with absorption peaks between 780–810 nm, and emission wavelength in the range of 750–1150 nm. Note that the NIR emission wavelength ranges of IR 783,10 IR 806,7,8,26,30 IR 808,8,31 IR 820,8,10,28 IR 845,10 ICG,12,27,29 and Cyto 84011 overlap with the absorption spectrum of Yb (at ∼980 nm) and Nd (at 740/808 nm) that are commonly utilized as lanthanide sensitizers. This provides possibilities to allow nonradiative energy transfer from organic dyes to lanthanide ions. The reported fluorescent dyes such as ATTO 488,11 Cy 3.5,26 and BODIPY-FL26 have absorption peaks between 470–520 nm and emission wavelength covering 440–800 nm. Though their emissions cannot produce significant spectral overlapping with the absorption of commonly utilized lanthanide sensitizers Nd3+ and Yb3+, they can enable strong spectral overlapping between visible–visible or visible–NIR dyes, collectively providing opportunities to finally sensitize Nd3+ and Yb3+ ions through cascaded energy transfer from different types of organic dyes. On the other hand, organic dyes with both absorption and emission in the visible range provide alternative possibilities to directly sensitize other luminescent lanthanide ions such as Tb3+ and Eu3+. Note that all reported organic dyes comprise functional groups (e.g., sulfate and/or carboxylic), which are important to stabilize them on the UCNP surface through the coordination to exposed surface metallic ions.

3.2 Dye-sensitized core nanocrystals
In 2012, a seminal work was reported, attempting to enhance the brightness of ∼16 nm core-only β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ UCNPs by overcoming their weak and narrow near-infrared absorption through organic dye sensitization (Fig. 5a).7 Nucleophilic substitution of the central chlorine atom in the commercially available cyanine dye, IR-780, was used to yield a carboxylic acid-functionalized derivative IR 806 dye with an absorption spectrum mainly between 650 and 850 nm. The carboxylic group enables the IR 806 dye to attach to the surface of β-NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+ nanocrystals by replacing the original oleylamine group capped on the surface used during the synthesis of the UCNPs. The overlap between the emission spectrum of IR-806 and the absorption spectrum of the nanoparticles at 900–1000 nm allows Förster-type energy transfer from the excited IR-806 to the Yb3+ absorption centers on the surface of the nanoparticles (Fig. 5b), which further sensitized Er3+ to produce UCL. The observed UCL at 510/540 nm and 650 nm corresponds to the 2H11/2/4S3/2 → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions of Er3+, respectively. The dependence of UCL on the excitation density showed that two-photon processes were involved in producing the observed UCL (Fig. S1, ESI†). The extinction coefficient of IR 806 was estimated to be about 390 l g−1 cm−1 at 806 nm, which is ∼5 × 106 times higher than that of the β-NaYF4:Yb/Er nanoparticles at 975 nm (7 × 10−5 l g−1 cm−1). As a result, the UCL intensity from IR 806-sensitized core-only nanocrystals when excited at ∼800 nm was shown to be ∼1100 times higher than that from non-dye-sensitized core-only nanocrystals when excited at ∼980 nm (Fig. 5c). When considering a broad spectral response range of ∼720–830 nm for upconversion, the dye-sensitized system was about 3300 times brighter than the non-dye-sensitized system. Later, the dye antenna approach was extended and applied to a set of β-NaYF4:Yb3+/X3+ (X = Er, Tm, and Ho) nanoparticles for visible multicolor discrimination of infrared light, displaying a more than 10-fold increase in the UCL intensity.25 Moreover, a set of NIR organic dyes with distinctive absorption ranges were also utilized to enable UCNPs (β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+) to possess an excitation band tunable in a wide spectral range (780–850 nm) (Fig. 5d).10 And, a simultaneous use of multiple types of dyes on the surface can widen the photon absorption window of UCNPs (β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+) dramatically, from only the NIR range (975 nm) to the entire visible and NIR range (450–975 nm) (Fig. 5e).26 Three types of dye sensitizers (sensitizer I: BODIPY-FL, sensitizer II: Cy3.5, sensitizer III: IR806), each encompassing an energy harvesting organic fluorophore and a carboxylic acid for linkage to the nanoparticles, were chosen to be attached to the surface of UCNPs to perform sensitization. The sufficient spectral overlap between the emission spectrum of sensitizer I (500–650 nm) and the absorption spectrum of sensitizer II (470–650 nm), and the emission spectrum of sensitizer II (600–800 nm) and the absorption spectrum of sensitizer III (650–850 nm), enabled a cascade Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensitization of the UCNPs, while empowering a collective absorption spectra (420–850 nm) of type I–III sensitizers. Interestingly, a double dye-bound NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ upconverting nanoparticle system was able to regulate the relay of anti-Stokes transformation of the excitation energy from the NIR excited dye (Cyto 840) to the visible light excited dye (ATTO 488).11 In this system, the NIR dye Cyto 840 harvests excitation photonic energy and sensitizes the NaYF4:Yb3+,Tm3+ nanoparticle, which then donates its upconverting energy in a FRET way to the dye of ATTO, allowing release of the energy as visible fluorescence. This work makes a solid step forward to store and extract photonic energy through the formulation of a network of resonance energy transfer. More recently, it was shown both experimentally and theoretically that the optimal doping concentration of Nd3+ in colloidal NaYF4:Nd3+ upconverting nanoparticles could be increased from 2 to 20 mol% when an energy harvesting organic dye (ICG) is anchored onto the nanoparticle surface, resulting in ∼10 times higher UCL brightness.27 The mechanistic analysis indicated that a combination of efficient photon harvesting due to the large absorption cross section of ICG (∼30000 times higher than that of Nd3+), non-radiative energy transfer (efficiency ∼57%) from ICG to the surface bound Nd3+ ions, and energy migration among the Nd3+ ions was able to activate Nd3+ ions within the nanoparticle at a rate comparable with that of the pronounced short-range quenching interaction at elevated Nd3+ concentrations.

Despite recent progress in dye-sensitized core-only nanocrystals, several drawbacks persist: (i) the spectral overlap between the emission of the reported NIR dyes and the absorption of the typically used sensitizer Yb3+ ions is rather limited, restraining the Förster type energy transfer efficiency from the dye to the UCNPs; (ii) due to the nanoscale size, the core-only UCNPs feature strong surface-related luminescence quenching effects. Especially, since the sensitizer Yb3+ ions have only two levels (i.e., the 4F7/2 and 4F5/2 states), the extracted energy from NIR dyes is allowed to migrate efficiently and randomly through the Yb3+ ions, thus producing a high probability of getting deactivated by surface quenchers; (iii) the binding stability of the dye onto the core-only UCNP surface remains unknown, along with the unknown photostability of the dye-sensitized core-only upconversion system; (iv) moreover, the optimized number of dyes per nanoparticle has often been reported to be less than 1000:1, confining the ability of dye-sensitized upconversion for light harvesting. This issue also applies to dye-sensitized core/shell UCNPs systems, which deserve our rapt attention for further investigations.
3.3 Dye-sensitized core/shell nanocrystals
Recently, a new concept of energy cascaded upconversion in a NIR dye-sensitized inorganic core/shell structure was introduced, aiming to address the spectral mismatch between the emission of the NIR dye and the typically used sensitizer Yb3+ ions, and the strong surface-related luminescence quenching problem associated with dye-sensitized core-only nanocrystals.8 It was demonstrated utilizing the design of NIR dye (IR808) sensitized core/shell (NaYbF4:Tm3+0.5%)@NaYF4:Nd3+ nanoparticles (Fig. 6b), in which Nd3+ ions are doped in the shell layer as the intermediate sensitizer S1, while Yb3+ and Tm3+ ions serve as corresponding lanthanide sensitizer S2 and activator A ions positioned in the core (see Fig. 4b). Broadly absorbing infrared dyes are able to efficiently harvest irradiation energy first, which is nonradiatively transferred (Förster-type) to the Nd3+ ions in the shell and, sequentially to the Yb3+ ions in the core that sensitize Tm3+ ions positioned also in the core to produce efficient multiphoton UCL peaked at 340 nm (from the 1I6 state, five-photon process); 350, 450, and 510 nm (from the 1D2 state, four-photon process); 480 and 660 nm (from the 1G4 state, three-photon process) (Fig. 6a and Fig. S1, ESI†). The involved number of photon processes was confirmed by the investigation of power dependence of UCL. However, saturation effects took place for IR-808 sensitized UCNPs (Fig. S2b–d, ESI†) due to the increased UCL efficiency (Fig. S2, ESI†). The integrated intensity of multiphoton UCL from the optimized (NaYbF4:Tm3+0.5%)@NaYF4:Nd3+30%UCNPs (without dye sensitization) was found to be six times higher than that from the well-established ∼30 nm sized NaYF4:Yb3+30%, Tm3+0.5%@NaYF4 core/shell nanoparticles, verifying a successful suppression of surface-related quenching mechanisms (Excitation at ∼980 nm). A very short ionic NOBF4− ligand was first used to replace the original oleic ligand, and then further exchanged with the carboxylic-functionalized IR-808 dye, allowing a close binding of the IR-808 dye (through sulfate and/or carboxylic groups) to the surface of the core/shell nanoparticle. The dependence of the luminescence intensities from the 1I6, 1D2, 1G4 states follows a curvy increase and then declines with the increased dye: NP ratio (Fig. 6d). The increase was ascribed to the increased overall absorption of the excitation energy at 800 nm by an increasing number of surface-bound antenna molecules, while the decrease was explained as the increased interactions between the antenna dye molecules on the core/shell nanoparticle surface (resulted in the quenching of dye fluorescence), in good agreement with the result of theoretical modelling that considered all activation and deactivation processes of dyes and Nd3+ ions. For the optimum dye: NP number ratio was determined to be ∼830, which indicates that a mean of ∼830 antenna molecules (absorption cross section, 1.84 × 10−17 cm2) was bound to the surface per (NaYbF4:Tm3+0.5%)@NaYF4:Nd3+30% core/shell nanoparticle (absorption cross section, 1.48 × 10−15 cm2). It should be noted that instead of the slight spectral overlapping reported in the literature, a strong overlapping between the emission spectrum of IR 808 and the absorption spectrum of Nd3+ ions doped in the shell allows nonradiative energy transfer across the organic/inorganic interface at an efficiency as high as 82%, followed by the well-established nonradiative energy transfer process of Nd3+ → Yb3+ across the inorganic shell/core interface (efficiency of 80%), as experimentally determined by time-resolved luminescence studies. This efficient energy transfer enables IR-808 dye-sensitized (NaYbF4:Tm3+0.5%)@NaYF4:Nd3+30% core/shell UCNPs, with suppressed surface-related luminescence quenching, to be ∼14 times higher than that of (NaYbF4:Tm3+0.5%)@NaYF4:Nd3+30% UCNPs without the dye sensitization, and 658 times higher than the typically reported (NaYF4:Yb3+20%,Tm3+0.5%,Nd3+1%)@NaYF4:Nd3+20% core/shell nanoparticles (Fig. 6e, excitation density of ∼10 W cm−2). The enhanced UCL from the dye-sensitized versus the non-dye-sensitized core/shell UCNPs can be clearly seen from photographic images (Fig. 6c). The upconversion efficiency (UCE) was evaluated to be about ∼9.3% [corresponding to an upconversion quantum yield (UCQY) of ∼4.8%] for the UCL of Tm3+ at 10 W cm−2 of 800 nm using a relative method. The UCE is defined by the ratio of the emitted light energy (UCL) to the absorbed light energy (eqn (7)), while the UCQY described the ratio of the number of emitted photons (UCL) to the number of absorbed excitation photons (eqn (8)). (7) (8)Moreover, dye-sensitized upconversion has been demonstrated for different inorganic host lattices [in (NaYF4:Yb3+ /Tm3+)@NaLuF4:Nd3+], different activators [in (NaYF4:Yb3+/X3+)@NaYF4:Nd3+ (X = Tm, Er, and Ho)], and with varying types of dyes for sensitization or co-sensitization [IR 783, IR 806, IR 808, IR 820, and ICG in (NaYF4:Yb3+/Tm3+)@NaYF4:Nd3+], demonstrating the generality of the dye-sensitized upconversion approach for inorganic core/shell nanostructures. Later, the concept of energy cascaded upconversion was extended to IR806-sensitized NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@β-NaYF4:Yb3+ UCNPs, where the typically used sensitizer Yb3+ was directly doped in the shell, instead of utilizing the Nd3+ ions, as in ref. 13. With an optimized Yb3+ ion concentration of 10% in the shell, the absolute UCQY was measured to be ∼5% at 2 W cm−2 of 800 nm for the two-photon UCL of Er3+. A similar result was also observed using IR-820 sensitized NaLuF4:Gd,Yb,Er@NaLuF4:Yb,Pr core/shell UCNPs. The UCL is enhanced about 800 times when comparing excitation at 820 and at 980 nm (the dye sensitization effect does not exist at 980 nm excitation).28 It should be noted that dye-sensitized core–shell structures with photon upconversion could be alternatively tailored to yield efficient downshifting luminescence.29 The ICG sensitized NaYF4:Yb3+/X3+@NaYbF4@NaYF4:Nd3+ (X = null, Er, Ho, Tm, or Pr) core/shell/shell nanostructure was shown to be able to produce a set of narrow band emissions with a large Stokes-shift (>200 nm) in the second biological window of optical transparency (NIR-II, 1000–1700 nm). This NIR-II luminescent system imparts a better imaging profile than the typically used Yb/Tm-codoped upconverting nanocrystals imaged in the NIR-I region (700–950 nm).

The dye molecules on the core/shell nanoparticle surface absorb photons and transfer excitation energy to the Nd3+ ions in the shell, which in turn sensitize Yb3+ ions in the core. Subsequently, intracore energy transfer from Yb3+ to Tm3+ excites the Tm3+ ions from the ground state to the 1G4, 1D2, and the 1I6 states.

The drawback of the aforementioned dye-sensitized core/shell structure with energy cascaded upconversion is that its energy transfer efficiencies are strongly limited by the single exclusive pathway for the transfer of harvested energy from dye molecules across the inorganic shell layer to the lanthanide ions in the core nanoparticles. Simultaneous incorporation of Nd3+ and Yb3+ ions as energy routers in the shell can entail a synergistically enhanced transfer (via three pathways) of broadly-harvested photonic energy from surface-anchored indocyanine (ICG) on the surface to Yb3+ ions in the core (Fig. 7a).12 A strong overlap of the emission spectrum of the ICG dye (750–1000 nm) with the absorption peaks of Nd3+ (peaked at ∼800 and 850 nm) as well as the absorption peak of Yb3+ (peaked at ∼976 nm) allows for Förster-type energy transfer from the excited ICG molecules (energy donor) to both Nd3+ and Yb3+ acceptors in the shell layer. In this case, the energy cascading from the ICG dye involves three main paths: (1) the energy is transferred from ICG to Yb3+ in the shell layer across the organic/inorganic interface, and subsequently transmits to Yb3+ in the core; (2) the excitation energy is transferred from ICG to Nd3+ in the shell layer, and then migrates to Yb3+ in the core; (3) the harvested energy is transferred from ICG to Nd3+ in the shell layer, followed by the local delivery to Yb3+ in the shell, and then sensitizes the Yb3+ ions in the core. Since a set of X3+ (X = Er, Ho, Tm) activators can be incorporated into the inorganic core, the multiple paths of energy transfer are able to produce a palette of upconverted multicolor output through well-established energy transfers from the sensitizer Yb3+ to the activator X3+ (X = Er, Ho, Tm) (Fig. 7b). Compared with the established ICG-sensitized core/active shell nanocrystals of (NaYF4:Yb3+/X3+)@NaYF4:Yb3+ (energy transfer path 1 is involved) and (NaYF4:Yb3+/X3+)@NaYF4:Nd3+ (path 2 is involved), the ICG-sensitized (NaYF4:Yb3+/X3+)@NaYF4:Nd3+/Yb3+ (X = Er, Tm, and Ho) core/shell UCNPs were shown to be about 2–3 times more efficient (Fig. 7d) due to the synergistic effect from the multidimensional energy transfer (involving paths 1, 2 and 3). The fluorescence lifetime of the ICG dye was measured and evaluated to be ∼1.73, 0.92, 0.35, and 0.23 ns for the free dye, ICG-sensitized core/shell UCNPs with Yb3+, Nd3+, and Nd3+/Yb3+ incorporated in the shell, respectively (Fig. 7c). The shortest lifetime for ICG-sensitized (NaYF4:Yb3+/X3+)@NaYF4:Nd3+/Yb3+ indicates the most efficient energy transfer across the inorganic/organic interface, in agreement with the UCL excitation spectra (Fig. 7d). A theoretical investigation indicated that the overall efficiency of the energy transfer from surface ICG dyes to the Yb3+ in the inorganic core could be as high as ∼98%. Indeed, this highly efficient transfer enables upconversion of NIR light in a broad spectral range (680–850 nm) into a set of visible multicolor emissions with an ultrahigh upconversion efficiency (∼16.4% for X = Er, 14.9% for X = Tm, and 11.8% for X = Ho, excitation at 800 nm of 8 W cm−2). Following this work and using identical multidimensional energy transfer pathways, a 28-fold overall enhancement in the UCL intensity for NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+@NaYF4:Yb3+/Nd3+ core/shell nanoparticles was observed using IR 806 dye sensitization.30 Moreover, the UCL intensity of the core–shell–shell structured NaGdF4:Yb,Er@NaGdF4:Yb@NaNdF4:Yb UCNPs could also be enhanced over 7 times when the IR 808 dye was introduced into the particle surface to perform sensitization.31 The advantage of this core–shell–shell design with separated Nd and Yb in the shells is that nearly 100% Nd ions in the outmost shell allow efficient extraction of the excited energy from the dyes, while the Yb-containing shell layer minimizes the possible energy transfer back from the core to the surrounding environment, thus maximizing the UCL efficiency.

4. Applications
4.1 NIR detection cards, photovoltaics, and security applications
NIR visualizers (detection cards) are pocket-sized, low cost alternatives to NIR instrumental detectors with an identification wavelength range from 700–1700 nm, capable of semi-quantitative detection. The commercial NIR cards generally contain a phosphor-coated sensor area that emits clearly visible light when illuminated by NIR sources. However, due to the photo-bleaching of the luminophore, the commercial NIR cards cannot be exposed to long time illumination and their spectral width sensitivity is limited to tens of seconds. A fabrication of the NIR sensor cards with extended identification wavelength range (720–870 and 920–1000 nm) was reported recently using dye-sensitized core/shell UCNPs (Fig. 8a).8 In the card design, IR-808 and IR-820 co-sensitized (NaYbF4:Tm3+0.5%)@NaYF4:Nd3+ core/shell nanoparticles were homogeneously implanted in a polystyrene film to form a NIR sensor card with a discriminate wavelength coverage of 720–870 nm (due to light harvesting by dyes), and 920–1000 nm (due to light harvesting by Yb3+ ions). Compared to a commercial production of Newport F-IRC2, the homemade card exhibits a 15 times improvement in the illumination time of 300 s (Fig. 8a). Moreover, these home-made IR cards can also be excited by low power incoherent light from a conventional light source (Halogen lamp) with an excitation power density of 0.016 W cm−2 in the spectral range of 750–1100 nm, producing adequate three-photon blue UCL for clear visualization of patterned letters (Fig. 8b). Note that this level of power density is comparable with sun power density at the Earth surface (∼0.0163 W cm−2 of average power density and the whole spectrum; sun power density at the equator can be as high as 0.1 W cm−2).

It has been predicted that the Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit of a solar cell with a 1.7 eV bandgap can be boosted from 28.2% to as high as 43.6% using upconverters with a narrow absorption bandwidth of ∼0.5 eV, which converts sub-bandgap IR light into above-bandgap visible light for exciton generation to circumvent the main IR transmission losses.32 The reported endeavors using rare-earth-doped upconversion materials as rear reflector layers or embedded in an internal light-harvesting layer enable the NIR response of the solar cell device,33 but the overall increase of the solar cell efficiency remains yet limited.34 This is primarily because the utilized upconversion materials are only able to harvest NIR light with a narrow absorption width (10–20 nm) at around ∼980 or 785 nm and with a low light absorption cross section (∼10−20 cm2).35 The observed highly efficient upconversion under incoherent light excitation with irradiance comparable to that of one sun irradiation implies the important use of dye-sensitized upconversion for photovoltaic applications, by efficient harvesting of a broad spectrum of IR light (typically over 150 nm) with a tremendously enhanced absorption cross section (∼10−16–10−17 cm2).8 Indeed, IR 783-sensitized NaYF4:10%Yb,2%Er@NaYF4:30%Nd UCNPs have recently been reported to significantly improve NIR harvesting of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) (Fig. 8c).36 Non-responsive NIR light in a broad spectral range (over 190 nm, 670–860 nm) was enabled to produce charge carriers through upconversion into narrow solar-cell-responsive visible emission (520/540 nm) that overlaps with the absorption spectrum of the N719 dye. The efficiency of the DSSC was elevated from 7.573% to 8.568%, producing an enhancement of power conversion efficiency by about 13.1%. This result provides compelling evidence for the effectiveness of dye-sensitized lanthanide upconversion for efficiency improvement of photovoltaic devices.
Since human eyes are sensitive to visible light while possessing no response to NIR light, upconversion materials constitute an ideal candidate for anti-counterfeiting.37 Upconversion emission with tunable color, being encoded into a single NaYF4 microparticle for anti-counterfeiting under single wavelength excitation, has been reported.38 Alternatively, the tunable luminescent lifetime of UCNPs was exploited to demonstrate various images acquired using the time domain.39 The broad, tunable excitation wavelength range as well as the super brightness of dye-sensitized upconversion thus provide new dimensions towards security applications. In this context, the “invisible ink” was formulated recently using a mixture of IR808-sensitized (NaYbF4:Tm3+0.5%)@NaYF4:Nd3+ core/shell UCNPs and a visibly transparent polystyrene polymer.8 Polystyrene is able to stabilize the IR 808 dye on the surface of the core/shell UCNPs, to host the luminescent dye-sensitized upconverting substance and to isolate it from environments to avoid any deleterious photobleaching effects induced by photochemical reactions. It is shown that the printed pattern with this ink appears nearly invisible to the naked eye under white light illumination, while bright blue letters are recognized with a high contrast when exposing the printed paper to light of broad NIR wavelengths ranging from 730–980 nm. This indicates that high-quality “invisible inks” have strong implications for commercial anti-counterfeiting uses with diversified excitation wavelengths. Similarly, the NIR-stimulated traffic signal of “GO or NO” was fabricated using PMMA embedded with dye sensitized β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,2%Er3+ UCNPs (Fig. 8d). The letters “G”, “N” and “O” are loaded with IR 783 sensitized UCNPs, IR 845 sensitized UCNPs, and IR 783 + IR 845 co-sensitized UCNPs, respectively.10 Therefore, under the excitation of 790 nm, the letters of “G” and “O” are visualized by UCL, displaying “GO”. Vice versa, under the excitation at 850 nm, the logo of “NO” is emerged. More recently, an information security technology was demonstrated, integrating the dye-sensitized β-NaYF4:20%Yb3+,0.5%Tm3+ UCNPs with ultraviolet (UV)-responsive photo-acid-generators (PAGs) on a destructible ultrathin resistive random access memory (RRAM) device.26 The emitted UV photons from UCNPs are transferred to the PAGs for inducing fast and complete chemical destruction of stored data in the RRAM device. The wavelength-selective, spatially controlled, localized etching of different electronic parts (e.g., memory units and processing units) was imparted using dye-sensitized UCNPs (Fig. 8e), providing a new paradigm of information security in nonvolatile data storage devices.
4.2 Displays
As emerging optical materials upconversion nanocrystals play an important role in display technology, allowing three-dimensional, full-colour display systems with high spatial resolution and a locally addressable colour gamut.40,41 A representation is a recent work involving the use of non-sensitized core-multishell UCNPs that emit tunable red, green and blue colors by cooperatively adjusting the excitation wavelength and the excitation interval at both ∼800 and 980 nm, see ref. 41. Dye-sensitized upconversion with tunable diversified excitation wavelength shows great potential in this regard. A proof-of-concept experiment showing perspectives of multicolor display applications was demonstrated (Fig. 9).12 ICG-sensitized (NaYF4:Yb3+/X3+)@NaYF4:Nd3+/Yb3+ (X = Er, Tm, and Ho) UCNPs were doped into the transparent polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) cylinders to yield bright UCL with a range of colors visible under regular lighting conditions (Fig. 9a). Multicolor UCL patterns (Fig. 9b) and green UCL letters (Fig. 9c) can be visualized through a structured laser beam profile or a patterned mask. Importantly, the PDMS composite is able to present bright, non-dwindling upconversion luminescence under laser irradiation at 800 nm of 8 W cm−2 for up to 5 hours, suggesting the potential use of dye-sensitized upconversion for volumetric multicolor displays. Exploiting nonsteady-state upconversion processes of dye-sensitized systems for achieving unprecedented colour tunability would be appealing for display applications.

4.3 Bioimaging
Bioimaging plays an important role in biomedical research, being especially crucial for diagnosis of diseases at early stages. Conventional non-dye-sensitized UCNPs have been widely employed in bioimaging due to their distinct merits, such as the hypotoxicity and the use of NIR light for excitation, which results in high imaging depth and low autofluorescence.42–44 Furthermore, the anti-Stokes character of UCL eliminates the possibility of even a low autofluorescence background, thus supporting a high signal to background ratio for UCL-based bioimaging. Dye-sensitized UCNPs are to be even more promising for bioimaging due to a significantly enhanced UCL as well as a diversified excitation wavelength. The hydrophobic dye sensitized UCNPs are often converted into the aqueous phase through coating of an amphiphilic polymer (DSPE-PEG 2000, Fluoronic 127, phosphatidylcholine). This approach exploits the van der Waals interaction to confine the lipophilic dye and UCNP within the core formed by the hydrophobic part of the amphiphilic polymer, while the outer hydrophilic part of the amphiphilic polymer enables aqueous dispersion. A typical procedure involved mixing dye-sensitized UCNPs with the amphiphilic polymer at an appropriate weight ratio in chloroform, then evaporation of chloroform, and finally hydration with purified water (Fig. 10a). It was reported that DSPE-mPEG-2000 was utilized to coat ICG-sensitized (NaYF4:Yb3+/X3+)@NaYF4:Yb3+/Nd3+ (X = Er, Tm, and Ho) UCNPs to produce multicolor UCL from aqueous dispersion for imaging of cancer cells in vitro (Fig. 10a).12 Similarly, Pluronic F127 was utilized to encapsulate IR 806-sensitized (NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+)@NaYF4:Yb3+ core/active shell UCNPs. A subcutaneous injection of these UCNPs in mouse was implemented to show their potential use for in vivo animal imaging.13 However, for both DSPE-mPEG-2000 and Pluronic F127 coatings, the as-synthesized water dispersible nanoparticles retain about 25–30% UCL intensity when compared to that before the phase transfer, and the UCL decreases with the time lapse. This is possibly associated with the intramicellar instability of the antenna anchoring of the dye on the surface of the UCNPs or an access of water through the amphiphilic coating to the NIR dye, causing its quenching. Interestingly, it was found that the phosphatidylcholine (PC) coating of Cy7-sensitized NaYF4:Yb,Nd,Er@NaYF4:Nd core/shell UCNPs was able to maintain the UCL intensity with a merely 30% decrease over 7 days.45 The good stability might associate with the steric dense pack feature of PC molecules, which are some of the main components of an animal cell membrane and have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical uses. This aqueous upconversion nanocomposite system has been applied for HeLa cellular imaging (Fig. 10b) as well as for lymphatic imaging (Fig. 10c) under biocompatible NIR excitation wavelengths. Recent progress in aqueous-phase dye-sensitized upconversion systems unlocks numerous opportunities for their biophotonic applications including, but not limited to, multimodal imaging, biosensing, photodynamic therapy and imaging guided therapy. In particular, these light-activated applications could potentially be implemented with low-cost incoherent light sources instead of the commonly used NIR laser diodes. This is of particular interest, as incoherent light sources are currently employed in most of the commercial instruments. This can help facilitate the translation of aqueous dye-sensitized UCNPs from bench to market.

4.4 Optogenetic applications
Optogenetics allows control of neurons via fast and specific excitation or inhibition within heterogeneous brain tissue on a temporal scale commensurating with physiological conditions.46 Optogenetics uses a set of light-sensitive proteins-opsins that either activate or suppress neuronal signaling in response to specific wavelengths of light by regulating the influx of either positively or negatively charged ions, such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, or Cl− through cell membranes. Despite its potential to revolutionize brain research, optogenetics has been impeded for clinical translation due to the difficulty to deliver sufficient visible light in deep brain regions for the activation. For example, a commonly used opsin called channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) is activated by blue light at ∼470 nm, which results in an opening of ion channels within the cellular membrane for the selective entrance of Na+ and Ca2+ into the cell, leading to membrane depolarization and firing of the neuronal impulse. However, the blue light is highly absorbed and scattered in tissue, which significantly limits the utility of optogenetics for modulation of neuronal signaling in live brain. Upconversion materials provide a route to circumvent this limit by converting tissue-penetrating NIR light to the needed visible light for in situ activation of opsins. Non-dye-sensitized UCNPs have been applied to upconvert NIR into visible light for activation of opsins and even for internalization in small organisms (C. elegans).47,48 However, these upconversion optogenetic demonstrations are still at the early stage of development.
Recently, dye-sensitized UCNPs were incorporated in a cellular substrate to enable activation of ReaChR opsin-transfected neuron cells in the NIR range (Fig. 11).13 IR 806-sensitized core/shell (NaYF4:Yb3+/Er3+)@NaYF4:Yb3+ UCNPs were synthesized and embedded into PMMA polymers to form a thin film, which was placed directly beneath a glass coverslip containing cultured hippocampal neurons. These channel rhodopsin-transfected neurons revealed a consistent depolarization and firing in response to red light whose wavelength overlaps with the red UCL band of Er3+ ions. In analogy, robust neuronal depolarization and firing phenomena were observed when 800 nm NIR light was delivered to the thin film containing the dye-sensitized core/shell UCNPs with an excitation power density of 0.117 and 1.5 W mm−2, respectively. Moreover, the dye-sensitized UCNP system enables temporal control of neuronal activation, as the neuronal action potential was shown to follow the pattern of light pulses (e.g., 100 ms, 500 ms, 2 s) in a time-locked fashion. However, this proof of concept demonstration requires the use of the macroscopic polymer film with embedded dye-sensitized nanoparticles, spatially confining those photon nanotransformers; it is unable to target the dye-sensitized UCNPs to the surface of neurons to enact efficient optogenetics, especially improbable for in vivo applications. Direct targeting of polymeric micelle-encapsulated non-dye-sensitized UCNPs to specific receptors on cell membranes has recently been shown in vitro to enable photoactivation of optogenetic proteins with a high precision. This is because the upconverted light from targeted UCNPs is only able to activate the opsins in the close vicinity.49 In analogy, use of dye-sensitized UCNPs with specific moieties to target neuronal cells can further enhance the efficacy of the in situ localized light upconversion, thus providing new possibilities to enact efficient targeted NIR optogenetics in vivo.

4.5 Photodynamic therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an important noninvasive, light induced treatment modality of cancer and other diseases, which is conducted using light-sensitive PDT drugs (photosensitizers, PSs). PSs are non-toxic in the dark but become cytotoxic, generating reactive species upon exposure to light at the wavelength of PS optical absorption. Conventional PSs are mostly activated by visible light, which has limited penetration through a biological tissue and restricts PDT treatment to lesions on or just below the skin or the lining of internal organs or cavities, consequently being less effective in therapy of deep and thick diseased tissues. A combination of conventional PSs with UCNPs, which can efficiently transform the deeper penetrating NIR light into PS-absorbing visible one, allowed for the development of upconversion PDT (UC PDT) that can be employed for treatment of deeper and thicker tumors.3 Similar to other applications of dye-sensitized upconversion, introduction of dye-sensitized UCNPs to UC PDT should result in an enhancement of its overall efficiency. Very recently, a complex nanosystem (abbreviated as UCSM) was developed to perform PDT and tracked by UCL, computer tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, which is composed of mesoporous silica-coated dye-sensitized UCNPs (IR-808-sensitized NaGdF4:Yb,Er@NaGdF4:Yb@NaNdF4:Yb) (Fig. 12c).50 As mentioned above (see Fig. 7), multidimensional energy transfer in these core–shell–shell UCNPs enables efficient drainage of the excitation energy from dye molecules all the way down to Yb3+/Er3+ in the core, thus producing efficient green and red UCL (Fig. 12a and b). To make complete use of the UCL spectrum for efficient UC PDT, two PSs of merocyanine 540 (MC540) and chlorin e6 (Ce6) were both entrapped into the mesoporous silica shell to absorb green and red UCL, respectively. The strong spectral overlaps between the absorption of PSs and the UCL provided for efficient activation of the PDT agents to generate cytotoxic ROS for efficacious antitumor therapy both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, in addition to UCL, the UCSM was shown to manifest the CT and MR imaging properties, revealing its potency in imaging-guided PDT. Fig. 12c illustrates pathways of energy transfer, preparation and application of the UCSM nanoformulation. It is worth, however, noting that the scheme of electronic excitation energy transfer realized in USCM is far from perfect. In fact, the efficiency of radiative energy transfer between UCNP and PS should be quite low, as the absorption cross-section of the PS molecules in the shell is not very high and the effective thickness of the PS absorptive layer is small. On the other hand, the efficiency of nonradiative transfer between Er and PSs can be negligible due to the existence of the intermediate shells. Moreover, the excited PSs can be deactivated not only through generation of ROS but also via energy transfer to the NIR dye (IR-808) in the neighboring shell. An improved nanosystem design is on demand to optimize pathways for energy transfer to acquire truly efficient UC PDT with dye-sensitized UCNPs.

5. Conclusions and outlook
Dye sensitized upconversion constitutes a diversified research field growing from conventional rare-earth doped nanoparticles, which, however, greatly alleviates their insufficient light harvesting problem. Indeed, by combining the advantages of both organic dyes and inorganic UCNPs, a superb next generation of organic–inorganic hybrid materials with thousands of times enhanced UCL brightness can be envisaged, along with imparted tunable and diversified excitation wavelengths. In this review, we provide a fundamental view of the Förster- and Dexter-type energy transfer processes involved in dye sensitized upconverison, of the geometric classification of dye-sensitized UCNPs, and of the designated multistep energy transfer pathways from the NIR organic dyes on the UCNP surface across the organic/inorganic and/or inorganic core/shell interfaces to the upconverting ion pairs positioned in the core. We have also highlighted recent progress in the development of dye-sensitized upconversion systems as well as their applications ranging from NIR visualizers, security applications, photovoltaics, displays, bioimaging, optogenetic activation of neuron cells, and photodynamic therapy. Despite implicit promising merits, current dye-sensitized upconverison systems still have some drawbacks that need to be overcome: (i) the stabilization of the organic dyes on the surface of UCNPs. Though the functional groups of the organic dyes enable us to coordinate to bare metallic elements on the surface, a set of experimental results from different groups have suggested a weak, non-stable bonding nature. (ii) The ratio of the number of organic dyes per single nanoparticle. Despite recent reports on close-to-unity energy transfer efficiency from the dye to the UCNPs, the optimal ratio for the number of dyes per UCNP is confined to be less than 1000:1, posing a strong limitation on the overall absorbance of dye sensitized upconversion systems. This phenomenon associates with the self-quenching effect of the organic dyes. Intentional manipulation of the packing and stacking of organic dyes with tailored structures on the surface of the UCNPs will be appealing here. (iii) The photostability of the organic dyes on the surface of the UCNPs. It is known that organic dyes photobleach with light exposure, degrading their optical properties and thus the UCL intensity. To overcome this, the isolation of the system of dye-sensitized upconversion from the environment (by encapsulation inside plolymeric or silica coatings) to prevent photochemical reactions is relevant.12 This also entails concurrent aqueous dye-sensitized upconversion that is important for bioapplications. (iv) The discrepancy of excitation dynamics between dye-sensitized and non-dye-sensitized upconversion remains unknown. Along with the enhanced absorbance of excitation light, the dye antenna effect can probably affect the number of excited lanthanide sensitizers as well as sub-level populations of the involved excited states, thus influencing the upconverting dynamics and efficiency. This hypothesis was portended by the observation that the induced UCL brightness enhancement varies with the size of the upconverting nanocrystals and the excitation power density utilized. Further mechanistic investigations towards this direction are desired. (v) The light harvesting range of dye-sensitized upconversion is typically confined to be ≤850 nm. Extending the dye-harvesting spectrum to a longer wavelength range (e.g., 850–1700 nm) would be fascinating as it would be of particular potential importance to increase the efficiency of most types of solar cells, such as perovskite solar cells that have the absorption upper limit at ∼850 nm. (vi) Bioapplication of aqueous dye-sensitized upconversion is at the burgeoning stage. Considering the comprehensive range of applications of the non-dye-sensitized upconversion nanocrystals, aqueous dye-sensitized upconversion with superior features provides game-changing possibilities towards bioapplications, especially, when considering the ability to be excited by incoherent light sources (such as light emitting diodes) that are already utilized in commercial imaging instruments. We hold an opinion that with multi-disciplinary efforts across chemistry, physics, materials engineering and biology, breakthroughs in the development of the dye-sensitized, lanthanide-doped nanocrystals will boom, and new applications will emerge in the near future.
