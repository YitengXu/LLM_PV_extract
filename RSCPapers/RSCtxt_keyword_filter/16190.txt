    , Accepted 21st December 2018First published on 22nd December 2018AbstractTwo asymmetrical molecules, namely IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F, are developed and used for multiple energy applications. The properties of these molecules, such as a wide absorption range, suitable energy levels, strong π–π stacking in a face-on orientation and high electron mobility, make them promising materials that can play different roles in both perovskite and organic solar cells (PVKSCs and OSCs). When working as electron transport materials (ETMs) and interfacial layer materials (ILMs), IDT6CN-TM provides MAPbI3-based inverted PVKSCs with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 18.36% (FF of 80%) and 19.79% (FF of 83%), respectively, which are among the highest PCEs and FFs reported so far. Moreover, the two compounds also show excellent performance as non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NF-SMAs) of OSCs. PCEs of up to 12.40% (FF of 74.7%) are obtained in IDT6CN-TM-based OSCs. To the best of our knowledge, 12.40% is the highest PCE for OSCs based on NF-SMAs with thienyl side chains. These results demonstrate that the asymmetrical molecules are effective multifunctional materials for both PVKSCs and OSCs.
1. Introduction
Developing technologies that convert solar energy into electricity is an effective way to address environmental pollution and energy shortages. Perovskite solar cells (PVKSCs)1–3 and organic solar cells (OSCs)4–6 are two of the rapidly progressing, next-generation photovoltaic technologies that could cost-effectively produce large-scale light-weight and flexible solar panels using solution-processing methods.7–9 Rapid progress has been made in hybrid organometal trihalide perovskite (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) solar cells since the first report by Miyasaka and co-workers in 2009.1 Thanks to their impressive optoelectronic properties including a high absorption coefficient from the visible to near infrared wavelength region,10,11 a long carrier lifetime,12,13 tunable bandgaps14 and high carrier mobility,3,15 remarkable photovoltaic performance has been realized in PVKSCs, marked by the high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >23% in the latest research.16 Meanwhile, the field of organic solar cells (OSCs) is also witnessing a dramatic performance enhancement mostly due to the development of efficient non-fullerene small molecule acceptors (NF-SMAs).17–20 One of the archetypal representatives of high-performance NF-SMAs is the 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone))-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (ITIC) family.21 The favorable combination of a ladder-type core, electron-withdrawing end groups and outstretched side chains endows ITIC-like NF-SMAs with a wide absorption range, appropriate frontier orbital energy levels and a high electron mobility. Top-of-the-line PCEs of OSCs based on NF-SMAs are over 13% for binary single-junction devices,22–25 over 14% for ternary single-junction devices26,27 and over 17% for tandem devices.28
Despite the similarity, the two PV technologies, i.e. perovskite and organic solar cells, have different research focuses. On the one hand, the most recent rapid growth of PCE in OSCs mainly comes from the design of active layer materials, e.g. n-type non-fullerene electron acceptors.17–28 On the other hand, the excellent properties of perovskite as the active component have provided PVKSCs with high PCEs. Therefore, optimizing the interfacial properties and developing novel interlayer materials becomes increasingly crucial for further improving not only device efficiency but also durability.29 Compared to the endeavours devoted to exploring efficient hole transport materials (HTMs), e.g. inorganics (NiOx (ref. 30) and CuSCN31), organic small molecules (Spiro-OMeTAD32 and DM16) and polymers (P3CT-Na33 and PDCBT34), relatively few electron transport materials (ETMs), particularly those based on organic materials, were reported, which are of great significance for the development of inverted PVKSCs.35–38 To date, the main choice of organic ETMs is fullerene and its derivatives (C60, PC61BM, ICBA and PC71BM).39–42 However, fullerenes possess inherent drawbacks such as poor ambient stability, low morphological rigidity and difficult structural modification, making them far from ideal ETMs for inverted PVKSCs. Therefore, rational design of new organic ETMs to replace fullerenes is vital for further developing inverted PVKSCs.
To this end, designing a high-performance n-type small-molecular organic semiconductor that could be used not only as an efficient ETM but also a high-performance electron acceptor in the active layer of OSCs would be an attractive and meaningful objective. In general, such n-type organic materials should meet the prerequisites from both sides. First, an efficient ETM in PVKSCs should fulfill several requirements including (i) good charge selectivity to improve electron collection efficiency, (ii) compatible energy levels with the perovskite and (iii) high electron mobility and conductivity to minimize interfacial resistance loss.43 Second, to work as an efficient electron acceptor in the active layer of OSCs, the molecule should have (i) high electron mobility, (ii) energy levels compatible with p-type polymers and (iii) suitable bandgaps to enable complementary absorption to the polymer.
Following these design rules, in this work, two new asymmetrical molecules, namely IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F, were designed and synthesized. The design of these molecules was inspired by our latest research where we synthesized a series of asymmetrical NF-SMAs composed of six- or eight-fused rings. These molecules exhibited large dipole moments that were almost perpendicular to the long axis of the molecule.44,45 We found that the dipole–dipole interaction between adjacent molecules strengthened the lamellar packing, and the dipole-induced antiparallel packing enhanced the intermolecular π–π stacking, which thereby resulted in the enhancement of the electron mobility in both horizontal and vertical directions (much higher than their symmetrical analogues). On the basis of our previous knowledge, the new molecules in this work, IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F, were successfully developed with further improved properties tailored for multifunctional applications. Thienyl side chains can further enhance the π–π stacking compared to a previously reported phenyl side chain.46 Moreover, fluorine and methyl substituted end groups can cause great differences in the dipole moment, energy level and electron mobility between the two molecules. We applied these molecules as ETMs and interfacial layer materials (ILMs) in inverted PVKSCs, as well as electron acceptors in OSCs. Impressively, in inverted PVKSCs, IDT6CN-TM as the ETM and ILM achieved PCEs of up to 18.36% and 19.8%, respectively, with high fill factors (FFs) of over 80% and a negligible hysteresis effect. The PCEs and FFs are among the highest values. Additionally, when used as an electron acceptor in OSCs, IDT6CN-TM (outperforming IDT6CN-4F) achieved a 12.40% PCE with a high FF close to 75% in combination with the polymer PM6.47 It should be noted that 12.4% is the highest PCE reported so far for OSCs based on NF-SMAs with thienyl side chains. These results demonstrate that the success of our design rule for multifunctional small molecules and also highlight the potential of such asymmetrical molecules in different applications, including but not limited to high-performance perovskite and organic solar cells.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis, absorption and energy levels
5-Hexylthiophen-2-yl has a stronger electron-donating ability than 4-hexylphenyl, and thus it can improve the yields of double addition and intramolecular Friedel–Crafts cyclization reactions45 to save material cost, which is a weighty consideration for industrialization. Facile Knoevenagel condensation reactions between IDT6Th-CHO45 and 2-(1-methyl-6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-4H-cyclopenta[c]thiophen-4-ylidene)malononitrile (CPTCN-M)48 or 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (IC-4F) were conducted to obtain IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F (Fig. 1a) in high yields over 90% (Scheme S1†). IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F show good solubility in commonly used solvents such as chlorobenzene and chloroform, meeting the basic requirements for solution-processing.

In dilute solutions, IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F exhibit wide absorption ranges with absorption maximums at 670 nm. From solution to film, large redshifts and strong electronic vibration shoulder peaks can be observed, suggesting strong intermolecular stacking in their neat films. The optical bandgaps (Eoptgs) of IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F were 1.60 eV and 1.58 eV, respectively (Fig. 1b). It should be noted that the strong absorption of IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F is beneficial for JSC in OSCs, but has no influence on the sunlight harvesting of inverted PVKSCs because the ETMs are behind the perovskite absorber. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out to evaluate the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the two molecules. From the CV curves, the LUMO/HOMO of IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F was determined to be −3.96 eV/−5.70 eV and −4.12 eV/−5.78 eV, respectively, which were comparable to the energy levels of fullerenes, making them candidates for ETMs in PVKSCs and NF-SMAs in OSCs.
2.2. Characteristics of materials
IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F were simulated by using density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G* level where the long alkyl chains were simplified to methyl groups. The rigid ladder-type core combined with the small steric effect between the donor unit and end group endows the two molecules with excellent planarity, evidenced by the small dihedral angles (less than 1°), which may promote an effective π–π stacking and thus facilitate intermolecular charge transport. The LUMO and HOMO of the two molecules are evenly distributed throughout the molecular skeleton, which is beneficial for intramolecular charge transport (Fig. 2a). Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) experiments revealed that both IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F neat films display well-defined face-on orientations with (100) diffraction peaks (0.34 Å−1) in the in-plane direction and (010) diffraction peaks (1.77 Å−1) in the out-of-plane direction (Fig. 2b), which benefits the vertical charge migration from the active layer to the electrode. IDT6CN-TM shows a significantly stronger and sharper π–π stacking peak (coherence length: 27.7 Å) than IDT6CN-4F does (coherence length: 15.9 Å), which is consistent with the fact that IDT6CN-TM (5.8 D) possesses a larger dipole moment than IDT6CN-4F (1.6 D) according to our previous studies on asymmetrical NF-SMAs.44,45

(c) Steady-state and (d) time-resolved PL spectra of the perovskite, perovskite/PCBM, perovskite/IDT6CN-TM and perovskite/IDT6CN-4F. 
To measure the charge transport properties, electron-only diodes with a device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/IDT6CN-TM (or IDT6CN-4F)/zirconium acetylacetonate (ZrAcac)/Al were fabricated. The electron mobilities of IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F were obtained by fitting the data using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model, which are 8.25 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.57 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Fig. S1†). As the rival of fullerenes, the high electron mobility of these two molecules offers them great potential as ETMs in PVKSCs and electron acceptors in OSCs.
Atomic force microscope (AFM) measurements on perovskite films with and without the ETMs were performed to study the surface morphology (Fig. S2†). The strong crystallization of the perovskite results in a typical rough surface with a root mean-square (RMS) roughness of 17.2 nm. After depositing IDT6CN-TM or IDT6CN-4F on top of the perovskite film, the RMS roughness of the perovskite dramatically reduces. Between the two materials, the IDT6CN-TM-coated perovskite shows a significantly lower RMS roughness (5.9 nm) than the IDT6CN-4F-coated perovskite (10.8 nm), which enables a better contact between perovskite/IDT6CN-TM and the electrode for more efficient charge collection.
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy were employed to understand the charge extraction properties of the two asymmetrical molecules. Fig. 2c shows the steady-state PL curves of the perovskite, perovskite/PCBM, perovskite/IDT6CN-TM and perovskite/IDT6CN-4F. The perovskite exhibits a strong emission when excited at 480 nm. After the ETMs are spin-coated onto the surface of the pristine perovskite, a remarkable PL quenching can be observed, indicating effective electron transfer from the perovskite absorber to the ETMs. The degree of PL quenching in a decreasing order is IDT6CN-TM > IDT6CN-4F > PCBM. TRPL spectra are displayed in Fig. 2d; the fitted PL lifetimes are 246.3 ns for the perovskite, 6.5 ns for perovskite/PCBM, 5.4 ns for perovskite/IDT6CN-TM and 4.2 ns for perovskite/IDT6CN-4F. Obviously, a sharp decrease of PL lifetime occurs when the perovskite is covered with the ETMs, and IDT6CN-TM- and IDT6CN-4F-coated perovskites decay faster than the PCBM-coated one. Moreover, it should be noted that the enhanced PL lifetime of perovskite/IDT6CN-TM relative to that of perovskite/IDT6CN-4F may be attributed to the stronger trap passivation effect of IDT6CN-TM (via more S–I and S–Pb bonding) on the perovskite surface to diminish the nonradiative recombination.49 These results demonstrate that the electron transport layers formed by the asymmetrical IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F have remarkable charge extraction properties that are beneficial for photovoltaic applications.
2.3. Photovoltaic performances of PVKSCs
To investigate the photovoltaic performances of PVKSCs employing IDT6CN-TM or IDT6CN-4F as ETMs, the p–i–n-type devices with an architecture of ITO/P3CT-Na/MAPbI3/IDT6CN-TM (or IDT6CN-4F)/BCP/Ag were fabricated, where P3CT-Na and BCP worked as the HTM and thin buffer layer, respectively. The detailed fabrication procedures are described in the ESI.† As shown in the cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) images (Fig. S3†), a perovskite absorber with large grains is well-sandwiched between the HTM and ETM. Next, the effect of ETM thickness on photovoltaic performance was investigated. According to our previous work,37 we varied the ETM thickness from 20 nm to 50 nm. The corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PVKSCs are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively, and the key photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1†. As the thickness of the ETM increases, the VOCs, JSCs and FFs of the IDT6CN-TM- and IDT6CN-4F-coated PVKSCs exhibit the same trend of first rising and then decreasing. The optimized thicknesses are 33 nm for IDT6CN-TM and 37 nm for IDT6CN-4F. PVKSCs based on IDT6CN-TM achieved PCEs of up to 18.36% along with a VOC of 1062 mV, a JSC of 21.51 mA cm−2 and a FF of 80%. Comparatively, PVKSCs using IDT6CN-4F as the ETM obtained a slightly lower PCE of 17.75% with a VOC of 1058 mV, a JSC of 21.74 mA cm−2 and a FF of 77%. Noticeably, a PCE of 18.36% and FF of 80% are one of the highest values for inverted PVKSCs based on MAPbI3 so far. Further comparison revealed that IDT6CN-TM enabled inverted PVKSCs can achieve similar VOC and JSC to PDI- and HNATA-type35,36 ETM-based PVKSCs but a remarkably higher FF and thus a higher PCE (Table S2†), which is attributed to the decent properties of IDT6CN-TM, i.e. the ordered π–π stacking, the high electron mobility, the smooth morphology of perovskite/IDT6CN-TM and the excellent charge extraction properties. In comparison, a control device with PCBM as the ETM was also prepared, and the J–V curves of the best-performing devices are shown in Fig. 3c. The PCBM-coated PVKSC exhibited a PCE of 16.84%, with a VOC of 1033 mV, a JSC of 20.86 mA cm−2 and a FF of 78%. Moreover, 20 devices fabricated in one batch showed good reproducibility (Table 1 and Fig. S4†) with average PCEs of 17.78% for IDT6CN-TM-based PVKSCs and 17.16% for IDT6CN-4F-based PVKSCs. Obviously, our novel asymmetrical molecules, IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F, outperform PCBM when acting as the ETM in PVKSCs.

To investigate the hysteresis of PVKSCs based on IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F as ETMs, the J–V curves were scanned from both forward and reverse directions. The results are shown in Fig. 3d, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table S3†. The PCEs of PVKSCs in forward and reverse scans are 18.15% and 18.36% for IDT6CN-TM, and 17.55% and 17.75% for IDT6CN-4F, respectively. Apparently, PVKSCs with the asymmetrical ETMs show almost no hysteresis effect, indicative of effective inhibition of ion migration.50,51 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of PVKSCs were measured, and higher responses in IDT6CN-TM- and IDT6CN-4F-based PVKSCs can be observed from 400 nm to 750 nm than in PCBM-based PVKSCs. JSCs integrated from EQE spectra are 19.82 mA cm−2 for PCBM-based PVKSCs, 20.45 mA cm−2 for IDT6CN-TM-based PVKSCs and 20.76 mA cm−2 for IDT6CN-4F-based PVKSCs, which are within a reasonable mismatch range compared to JSCs from J–V measurements. In addition, the stabilized photocurrent and PCE as a function of time (over 120 s) under a voltage bias of 0.92 V for IDT6CN-TM and 0.88 V for IDT6CN-4F were measured (Fig. 3f). As revealed, a steady-state power output of 18.15% and 17.57% with a JSC of 19.73 mA cm−2 and 19.96 mA cm−2 was recorded for IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F, respectively, confirming the reliable high performance.
Furthermore, as the air stability of PVKSCs becomes increasingly important, we measured the stability of PVKSCs with the newly designed ETMs and the control device with the PCBM ETM under ambient conditions with controlled humidity at 35–40%. As shown in Fig. S5,† the PVKSCs based on IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F displayed better stability than that based on PCBM, which maintained nearly 80% of the original efficiency after 336 hours. High efficiency, a negligible hysteresis effect, and the good air stability further confirm that the asymmetrical molecules, IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F, are promising candidates for inverted PVKSCs.
Further investigations on IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F as ILMs between the perovskite and C60 ETM were conducted. Inverted PVKSCs with a device structure of ITO/P3CT-Na/MAPbI3/IDT6CN-TM (or IDT6CN-4F)/C60/BCP/Ag were fabricated, where IDT6CN-TM or IDT6CN-4F was used as the ILM, C60 and BCP worked as the ETM and hole blocking layer, respectively. The detailed fabrication procedure can be found in the ESI.† The J–V curves of PVKSCs with and without IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F ILMs are shown in Fig. 4a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. Without IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F ILMs, PVKSCs with C60 as the ETM show a low PCE of 16.75% with a VOC of 1028 mV, a JSC of 21.16 mA cm−2 and a FF of 77%. After introducing a thin layer of IDT6CN-TM or IDT6CN-4F ILM between the perovskite and C60 ETM, the PCEs were significantly boosted with VOC, JSC and FF all being largely promoted. As a result, high PCEs of 19.79% and 19.29% were achieved in PVKSCs with IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F as the ILM, respectively, suggesting IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F can serve as efficient ILMs.

Moreover, PVKSCs with IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F as ILMs show negligible hysteresis effects (Fig. 4b). The PCEs of PVKSCs scanned from forward and reverse directions are 19.54% and 19.79% for IDT6CN-TM, and 19.06% and 19.29% for IDT6CN-4F, respectively (Table S4†). Average PCEs calculated from 20 devices fabricated in one batch were 19.11% for IDT6CN-TM-based PVKSCs and 18.60% for IDT6CN-4F-based PVKSCs, showing good repeatability (Table 2 and Fig. S6†). The integrated JSCs from EQE spectra are 21.17 mA cm−2 for IDT6CN-TM and 21.07 mA cm−2 for IDT6CN-4F (Fig. 4c), which are consistent with the measured JSCs within a reasonable error range. As shown in Fig. 4d, stable PCEs of 19.53% and 18.86% along with stabilized JSCs of 20.77 mA cm−2 and 20.28 mA cm−2 are clearly observed for IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F, respectively, confirming the reliable high performance.

To prove the multifunctionality of the molecules and to achieve the other main objective in our design rule, i.e., the asymmetrical molecules working as efficient electron acceptors in OSCs, we turn to study the photovoltaic performance of the OSC devices using IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F in their active layers. Considering the wide absorption, appropriate energy levels and a face-on orientation with strong π–π stacking and high electron mobility of the asymmetrical IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F, good photovoltaic performance can be expected. To this end, we fabricated OSC devices with a configuration of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/PM6:IDT6CN-TM (or PM6:IDT6CN-4F)/ZrAcac/Al, where PM6, a wide-bandgap polymer with a deep HOMO energy level, was employed as the electron donor, and a cheap ZrAcac served as an efficient cathode interfacial layer (CIL) due to the fact that the well matched energy levels of the ZrAcac layer and cathode (Al) are helpful for efficient charge extraction (Fig. 5a). The J–V curves (Fig. 5b) of best-performing OSCs based on IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F were obtained under the conditions that the total concentration of PM6 and IDT6CN-TM (or IDT6CN-4F) was 14 mg ml−1 with 0.25% DIO addition, and the annealing temperature was 100 °C. The corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 3. The OSC based on PM6 and IDT6CN-TM achieved a high PCE of up to 12.40% along with a VOC of 0.953 V, a JSC of 17.40 mA cm−2 and a FF of 74.7%. The high FF of PM6:IDT6CN-TM-based OSCs possibly benefits from the large dipole moment of asymmetrical NF-SMAs according to our previous study. It is worth mentioning that the efficiency of 12.40% is so far the highest value obtained for OSCs based on NF-SMAs with thienyl side chains. Comparatively, the PM6:IDT6CN-4F-based OSCs showed a slightly lower PCE of 10.88% resulting from a VOC of 0.859 V, a JSC of 18.34 mA cm−2 and a FF of 69.1%. Similarly, the relatively low FF may result from the significantly small dipole moment of the asymmetrical IDT6CN-4F, and the low VOC is mainly attributed to the low-lying LUMO energy level of IDT6CN-4F. Clearly, PM6:IDT6CN-4F-based OSCs exhibit higher absorption in the range from 300 nm to 500 nm and a broader EQE spectrum than those based on PM6:IDT6CN-TM (Fig. 5c), resulting in larger JSC. The integrated JSCs from the EQE spectra were 16.90 mA cm−2 for PM6:IDT6CN-TM-based OSCs and 18.01 mA cm−2 for PM6:IDT6CN-4F-based OSCs, which agrees well with the measured JSCs within a reasonable error range less than 3%.

2.5. Discussion and perspectives
To better understand the potential of the asymmetrical molecules as multifunctional materials, we fully compared the photovoltaic performances of IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F as ETMs and ILMs in PVKSCs and NF-SMAs in OSCs with other reported molecules, which are summarized in Table S2†. As can be seen, organic small molecules have rarely been used as ETMs in inverted PVKSCs, and only two of them achieved an efficiency over 18% with a FF lower than 79% in MAPbI3-based perovskite solar cells. This inspires us to explore efficient organic ETMs to further improve the performance of inverted PVKSCs. The asymmetrical molecule IDT6CN-TM shows the highest PCE among these ETMs that have a high FF of 80% in inverted PVKSCs based on MAPbI3, and IDT6CN-4F also offers a very high PCE. Notably, IDT6CN-TM as the ETM exhibits a significantly higher PCE than its symmetrical analogue ITCPTC-Th, showing the greater potential of the asymmetrical molecules than the symmetrical ones as ETMs in inverted PVKSCs. As the ILM, IDT6CN-TM achieved the champion PCE close to 20% with a high FF of 83%, which is higher than those of IDIC.52 In addition, IDT6CN-TM-based OSCs also obtained the highest efficiency of 12.4% with a high FF approaching 75% among the NF-SMAs with thienyl side chains. These results suggest that the asymmetrical molecules are potential multifunctional materials for both PVKSC and OSC applications.
3. Conclusion
In this work, asymmetrical n-type small molecules are successfully designed and applied in both perovskite solar cells as ETMs and ILMs, and organic solar cells as electron acceptors in the active layer. Two asymmetrical molecules with thienyl side chains, namely IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F, are judiciously designed and synthesized. The methyl-substituted IDT6CN-TM and the fluorinated IDT6CN-4F exhibit similar absorption spectra with optical bandgaps of 1.60 eV and 1.58 eV, respectively, but largely different LUMO energy levels. DFT calculations reveal that the two molecules both have excellent planarity with uniformly distributed HOMOs and LUMOs, which facilitates intermolecular and intramolecular charge transport. Moreover, the larger dipole moment enables a stronger π–π stacking of IDT6CN-TM compared to IDT6CN-4F, and thus a higher electron mobility is observed in IDT6CN-TM neat films. The high electron mobility, efficient charge collection and decent interfacial properties (good surface coverage on the perovskite film) allow IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F to work as efficient ETMs: IDT6CN-TM- and IDT6CN-4F-based inverted PVKSCs achieve PCEs of 18.36% (FF of 80%) and 17.75%, which are significantly higher than that of the PCBM-based one. As far as we know, 18.36% is the highest PCE attained in MAPbI3-based inverted PVKSCs employing non-fullerene small molecule-based ETMs. Similarly, PVKSCs using IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F as ILMs between the perovskite and C60 also achieve high PCEs of 19.79% and 19.29%, respectively. Moreover, when used as electron acceptors in OSCs, IDT6CN-TM-based OSCs exhibit a PCE of 12.4%, which is the highest value for OSCs based on NF-SMAs with thienyl side chains. The high photovoltaic performances of IDT6CN-TM and IDT6CN-4F demonstrate that asymmetrical molecules are promising multifunctional materials for PVKSC and OSC applications.
