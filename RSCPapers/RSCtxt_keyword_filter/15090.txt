, Accepted 1st August 2016First published on 22nd August 2016AbstractThe crystal structure, physical and chemical properties, and applications of titanium suboxides (TinO2n−1, n = integer greater than one) have recently attracted tremendous attention. In this paper, the structure and physical properties of titanium suboxides are summarized, and recent progress in their synthesis methods and applications in catalysis, environmental, electronic and optoelectronic devices and batteries is reviewed. The presence of two Ti3+ and (n − 2)Ti4+ provides TinO2n−1 with several possible configurations of cations in the crystal, various charge-ordered states and electronic structures which lead to their versatile physical properties, such as conductivity, magnetic and optical properties. A series of TinO2n−1 has been synthesized by redox reduction of different titanium sources of TiO2 and other raw materials. Notably, Magnéli phase titanium oxides (typically n is between 4 and 6) have played very important roles in Pt-catalyst support, organic degradation, coatings and supports in various electronic and optoelectronic devices. Undoubtedly, titanium suboxides are expected to become indispensable materials in future.Baoqiang XuBaoqiang Xu studied Non-ferrous Metallurgy from 1998 to 2002 at Central South University and received his MD of Physical and Chemistry on Metallurgy in 2005 from Kunming University of Science and Technology.

1 Introduction
The large experimental database and computational thermodynamic results have established that a number of titanium suboxide compositions exist in the Ti–O system.1–7 Stoichiometric TiO2 exists as the well-known minerals rutile, anatase and brookite, and additionally as two high pressure forms, a monoclinic baddeleyite-like form and an orthorhombic α-PbO2-like form. Titanium suboxides (TSO) are materials with the generic formula TinO2n−1 (n = integer greater than one). The maximum value of n is not known exactly. Jacob et al.8 estimated n to be 28, while Roy and White9 suggested that discrete equilibrium phases exist up to n = 99. The Magnéli phases of titanium oxide, which have been commercially recognized under the trade name Ebonex®, comprise a series of distinct compounds having the above formula with n between three and ten (and more typically between four and six).10 Magnéli phases have, however, been assessed to n = 20.6,11,12
With the removal of part of O atoms from their crystal structure, titanium suboxides have an excellent electric conductivity and remarkable visible light absorptivity, displaying diverse colors depending on the n value. These properties make them suitable for a variety of applications such as catalysis, degradation of pollutants, batteries, and electronic and optoelectronic devices. In recent years, hundreds of reports about preparation and application of colourful TiO2−x with disorder layer and pure TiO2 phase have been published. The existing of oxygen vacancy, Ti3+ and Ti–OH in its disorder layer contributed to high photocatalytic efficiency especially in organic pollutant degradation as well as in hydrogen evolution under visible light. In this aspect, Chen et al.13 has contributed an excellent review in 2015. This paper, here, would mainly summarize the progress on the structures and physical properties, and on preparation and application of titanium suboxides with definite titanium suboxides phase, to which much attention has recently been paid.
2 Structures and properties of titanium suboxides
2.1 Structures
TinO2n−1 is mixed-valence compounds with two Ti3+ (3d1 electronic configuration) and (n − 2)Ti4+ (3d0) ions. The presence of both Ti3+ and Ti4+ ions provides several possible configurations of cations in the crystal, leading to various charge-ordered states. The value of n controls not only the crystal structure but also the electronic structure.14
Bowden et al.15 calculated the X-ray powder diffraction patterns according to published crystal structures for all members in the homologous series of titanium suboxides TinO2n−1 for 4 ≤ n ≤ 9 and compared them with experimental patterns. For the n = 4 and n = 5 compounds, the calculated patterns are match well with the experimental diffraction patterns. Experimental patterns for suboxides with n > 5 were not presented, as they were difficult to synthesize as single-phases.15 The phase structure parameters of titanium suboxides are listed in Tables 1 and 2.16

2.1.1 TiO, Ti2O3 and Ti3O5. Titanium monoxide TiO has the NaCl type structure and phase, and its homogeneity range extends from TiO0.64 to TiO1.26.3 TiO contains about 15% vacancies at both Ti and O sites.3 α-TiO with ordered arrays of vacancies of monoclinic structure has a more stable lattice structure than β-TiO with the disordered vacancies, which mainly owes to the enhanced Ti–Ti bonding interactions through and around the oxygen vacancies.17,18Ti2O3 extends from TiO1.49 to TiO1.51,3 which contains pairs of Ti3+ ions in octahedral sites along the c axis. Each titanium-centered octahedron shares one face along the c axis and three edges in the ab plane with one another, corresponding to Ti(1)–Ti(2) and Ti(1)–Ti(3) bonds, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1. At low temperatures, Ti2O3 is a non-magnetic semiconductor and it shows a progressive transition to a metallic state in the vicinity of 450 K. Its properties are mainly determined by the presence of the Ti3+ ions with a 3d1 electronic configuration.25

Ti3O5 is stable as β-Ti3O5 at ambient conditions and α-Ti3O5 at temperatures higher than 514 K.21,27 Its crystal structures are shown in Fig. 2. The unit cell includes four Ti3O5 molecules with three different titanium sites, two Ti3+ and one Ti4+ sites, and five different oxygen sites. Each Ti site is a distorted oxygen octahedron but with significantly different Ti–O distances. Recently, high pressure behaviors of Ti2O3 and Ti3O5 have attracted some interesting and their structure changes were reported, especially in geosciences.28,29

2.1.2 Magnéli phase titanium oxides. The structures of Magnéli phase titanium oxides are based on the rutile TiO2 crystal lattice. Octahedral rutile TiO2 has a titanium atom at their center and oxygen atoms at each corner. Shared edge or corner oxygen atoms link adjacent octahedra, as shown in Fig. 3. In TinO2n−1, an oxygen deficiency in every nth layer leads to shear planes in the crystal structure. At the shear planes, the two-dimensional chains of octahedra share a face to accommodate the deficiency in oxygen. Page and Strobel24 systematically studied the structure of Magnéli phase TinO2n−1 (4 ≤ n ≤ 9) by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. They are remarkably homogeneous with similar ionic valences and similar distortions of the Ti–O and Ti–Ti distances. No even-odd alternance was noted, except that Ti4O7 presented a slightly lower average valence than those of others. And the evolution of ‘crystallographic shearing’ inside the crystal structure of TinO2n−1 has been verified by Afir and his coworkers30 based on the linear variation of their molar volumes with n measured by X-ray.

Fig. 4 shows the schematic crystal structure of Ti4O7, which is a mixed valence compound with two equally populated Ti4+ (3d0) and Ti3+ (3d1) configurations and can be regarded as electron doped (oxygen deficient) TiO2. Micro-dimension characteristic methods were employed to observe the oxygen loss of TiO2 and present oxygen vacancies.31,32 Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) study showed the most oxygen deficient Magnéli phase after annealing TiO2 (110) wafers to 1173 K. A model of the Ti4O7 (110) surface is presented in Fig. 5. The stoichiometry can be concluded by measuring distances between atomically resolved features and step heights in the STM images.33

2.2 Physical properties
2.2.1 Electrical conductivity. Titanium dioxide is a typical semiconductor, but the structures of titanium suboxides decide their versatile conductivities.34 Ti4O7 shows two conductivity transitions, a semiconductor–semiconductor transition in the temperature range of 130–140 K and a semiconductor–metal transition at 150 K.35,36 In Ti4O7 crystals, 3d electrons of Ti ions are localized to form covalently bonded Ti3+–Ti3+ pairs (Ti26+ dimers) and the crystal consists of ordered Ti-chains alternatively occupied by Ti4+ ions and the Ti26+ dimers in the Low Temperature (LT) phase. As for the intermediate temperature (IT) phase of Ti4O7, Lakkis et al.35 proposed that the Ti26+ dimers still exist and that they distribute on the Ti-chains without long range order. For the HT phase of Ti4O7, the 3d electrons are delocalized and the sample becomes a highly correlated paramagnetic metal. Consequently, corresponding spectral broadening is observed.14 The same tendency was proved by the discontinuous reflection spectrum changes of Ti4O7 single crystals at about 150 K and 130 K corresponding to metal–semiconductor and semiconductor–semiconductor transitions.36,37 Eyert et al.'s38 calculations based on density functional theory and the local density approximation showed that metal–semiconductor transition of Ti4O7 should arise from a complex interplay of charge order, orbital order, and singlet formation of those Ti 3d states. Resonant photoemission spectra (PES) of Ti4O7 demonstrated Ti 3d bands shift39 and embedded cluster Discrete Variational (DV)-X α method proved that some changes occur in Ti 3d across the metal–nonmetal transition of Ti4O7.40Marezio et al.41 reported on the physical properties of Ti5O9 single crystals prepared by the vapor-transport method, which clearly indicated two transitions in the lattice-parameters, the electrical-conductivity, the magnetic-susceptibility and the specific-heat measurements. No changes have been observed in the crystal structure of the three phases. Ti3+–Ti3+ pairing takes place in the low-temperature phase but that the crystal contains microdomains with unpaired Ti3+ cations at the domain walls. The intermediate phase is proposed to be a disordered phase similar to the intermediate phase of Ti4O7. Fairhurst et al.42 have reported the Ti5O9, Ti6O11, Ti7O13 and Ti8O15 contain Ti27+ dimers as intrinsic components of their crystal structures based on EPR spectra. Further, there exists a disorder of cationic charge distribution in the LT phase of Ti5O9, confirmed by an intense EPR signal, which was attributed to the 3d electrons localized at Ti27+ dimers. As far as Ti6O11, there is a charge disorder in each of the LT and IT phases, with only two thirds of the valences of cations expected for the complete charge order. Previous experiments have presented different conductivity values of titanium suboxides as listed in Table 3. The electrical conductivity of TinO2n−1, except TiO thin film, is greatest for n = 3, 4 and 5 and the conductivity decreases at higher n values. The similar conductivity change trend was presented in Radecka and his coworker's results. In their work, TinO2n−1 pellets with different n values (n = ∞, 167, 100, 32 and 22) were prepared in atmosphere of 93% Ar + 7% H2 for 3.5 h at different temperatures and the conductivity of samples remarkably decreased with n value reduction.43

On the other hand, the temperature remarkably affects electrical conductivity of TinO2n−1 because conductance transition occurs in the series of TinO2n−1 as shown in Tables 4 and 5. The electrical conductivity of Ti3O5 exhibits a temperature dependence characteristic of a semiconductor in the low-temperature phase; it shows an anomaly at 450 K, and has a metallic behavior above 450 K.49 Electrical resistivity of Ti4O7 as a function of temperature and pressure was measured under high pressure by using different contact arrangements and anisotropic electrical conduction was observed. When current is injected parallel to the principal axis, metallic conduction is predominant. But when current is injected non-parallel to the crystal's principal axis, a logarithmic divergence of the resistivity at low temperatures was obtained.50 The conductivities of both Ti5O9 and Ti6O11 increase with increasing temperature above the transition so that these do not appear to be true semiconductor-to-metal transitions. Ti5O9 undergoes two transitions separated by 5 K and the conductivity decreases by a factor of 50 overall. Ti6O11 undergoes a single transition resulting in the same amount of conductivity change. The polycrystalline Ti8O15 is semiconducting over the temperature range 78–295 K.51 Inglis et al.52 reported on the temperature dependence of the electrical conductance in the temperature range 4–320 K for crystalline samples of the series TinO2n−1, with 4 ≤ n ≤ 9. More than one type of conductance transition occurs in the series; the transition temperatures all fall within the range 120–150 K.

2.2.2 Optical properties. It is well known TiO2 has the excellent optical absorption performance under UV light (Ultra Violet light) and it has been one of most attractive photoelectrochemical (PEC) materials in photocatalysis field. Until now, human has been devoting to promote its PEC response and optical properties over the visible range by modifying TiO2.54–56The band gap energies of many suboxides of titanium TinO2n−1 with low n (n below 9) are at least 10 times smaller than Eg of the stoichiometric TiO2.43 Radecka et al. reported the effect results of nonstoichiometry on the PEC properties of TiO2−x aiming to use them as photoanodes in PEC and presented the optical properties in the vicinity of the fundamental absorption edge of nonstoichiometric TiO2−x polycrystalline samples. The optical studies revealed the presence of the fundamental absorption edge for slightly reduced samples only. But the energy band gap determined from both optical and photocurrent measurements increased with x within rutile phase stability.43
Assim57,58 and Abdel-Aziz et al.59 prepared thin films of TiO, TiO1.7, Ti2O3, TiO2 of thicknesses 50, 500 and 1000 nm on glass substrates by using an electron beam evaporation technique and calculated optical parameters and dielectric constants by analyzing the optical absorption data, as shown in Table 6. Miller et al.'s research results also show Eg decreased from 3.23 to 2.82 eV as the deposition temperature was raised from 15 to 450 °C. The exist of suboxide stoichiometries on surface of TiO2 film contributed to narrower band gaps of the 250 °C and 450 °C samples.60

Nguyen et al.61 fabricated TiO films on a polyimide substrate using inkjet printing technology. 20-layer inkjet-printed TiO on polyimide by annealing at 300 °C for 2 h in air presented a bandgap of 2.57 eV. Sedghi-Ghamchi et al. obtained optical band gaps for Ti2O3 film via 13 nm thickness, 4.08 eV for allowed direct transition and 3.81 eV for allowed indirect transition.62 The optical transmittance of Ti2O3 thin films in the visible wavelength region increased with decreasing film thickness. And the Ti2O3 films, same to other semiconductor, showed poor transmittance below 330 nm but good absorbance in the UV region.62
Recent amounts of work focusing on self-doping of Ti3+ on surface of TiO2 crystal and H–TiO2 have been reported and these titanium dioxide samples doped Ti3+ have manifested remarkable promotion of absorption ability to visible light.63,64

3 Synthesis of titanium suboxides
The synthesis of TinO2n−1 can be categorized into two groups by different titanium sources: TiO2 and other raw materials.
3.1 TiO2 as raw material
When TiO2 is used as the titanium source, reductants like carbon, hydrogen and certain active metals (e.g. Ti, Si, Mg, Al, or Ca) are used to remove oxygen and prepare different titanium suboxides, even the polymorphism of the same titanium suboxide.65 Besides, titanium suboxide single crystals can be grown by precisely controlling the oxygen fugacity in the reactor atmosphere.66
3.1.1 Carbothermic reduction of TiO2. Titanium dioxide can be reduced to remove oxygen by carbon under different inert atmospheres, and produce various titanium suboxides: 
nTiO2(s) + C(s) = TinO2n−1(s) + CO(g)
(1)For the carbothermic reduction of titania to prepare titanium suboxides, the carbon/titania ratio is important for the control of the product phase. An over stoichiometric carbon/titania ratio would lead to the formation of TiOxCy, not titanium suboxides.67,68 Recent evaluation and thermodynamic optimization of the Ti–C–O system by Cao et al.69 were helpful to predict and control the product phases of carbothermic process of TiO2. The phase evolution of reactions in mixtures of TiO2 and graphite was observed by means of X-ray at high temperatures in vacuum.30 These phases are, in order, the mildly sub-stoichiometric dioxide TiO2−x, the Magnéli sub-oxides TinO2n−1 with 4 ≤ n ≤ 9, the sesquioxide Ti2O3, the monoxide TiO, the monocarboxide TiC1−xOx and the monocarbide TiC, respectively.
Toyoda et al.70 used poly PVA as the carbon source and rutile TiO2 as the titanium source to synthesize different carbon-coated Magnéli phases TinO2n−1 by heat treatment at 1373 K in N2 atmosphere. Almost pure Ti4O7 phase was prepared when mass ratio of TiO2/PVA was 50/50 at 1373 K for 1 h and different mixtures of TinO2n−1 phases (n = 2, 3, 5, 6 and 9) were obtained at different mass ratios of TiO2/PVA. The measurement results of the decomposition of iminoctadine triacetate and phenol under the irradiation of fluorescent light with the wavelength of less than 400 nm confirmed the photocatalytic activity of these TinO2n−1 coated by carbon and low n-values of 2 and 3 gives higher activity than high n-values of 4–9.
Adamaki et al.71 prepared fine scale (260 μm diameter) and high-density Magnéli phase conductive ceramic fibers by carbothermic reduction, as shown in Fig. 6. Initially, the TiO2 fibers were produced by means of a thermoplastic extrusion process using stearic acid as the pre-coating material, toluene as the solvent and polyethylene as the binder to make thermoplastic homogeneous feedstock with 54 vol% TiO2. Then, the TiO2 fibers were sintered and reduced with carbon in a tubular furnace at 1473 K and 1573 K under argon.

The results of conductance tests shown in Fig. 7 indicated that the electrical conductivity of the reduced fibers can be tuned over five orders of magnitude (10−1 to 104 S m−1) and the increase in conductivity was 1013 compared with stoichiometric TiO2. Moreover, the conductivity of these Magnéli fibers produced at 1473 K and 1573 K, like that of conductors, was independent across the frequency range examined. The test results imply that these conductive fibers can be used as a sensing element, electrode, catalyst support, and energy storage material.

Notably, the appearance of the oxide Ti3O5 was transitory, especially λ-Ti3O5. Chai et al.,72 however, obtained λ-Ti3O5 powder by reducing pure rutile-type nano-TiO2 powder, coated with 1.0 wt% SiO2 and 3.0 wt% Al2O3, with 4.5 wt% nanosize carbon black at 1323 K for 3 h in argon. λ-Ti3O5 exhibits a wide absorption band ranging from 200 to 1400 nm and an efficient UV-visible and N-IR absorption. But it is difficult to prepare pure phase λ-Ti3O5 without unreacted TiO2. Stem et al.73 prepared a co-deposited layer of TiO2 and C with a thickness close to 200 nm on clear silicon by e-beam evaporation using the EB3 Multihearth Electron Beam Source from their targets with a purity of 99.99% under the deposition pressure in the range of 2.3–4.6 × 10−6 Torr and the e-beam co-deposition current of 150 mA for 1 min. After the co-deposition, hydrothermal annealing was carried out at 973–1273 K under two different flowing gases, ultrapure N2 or wet N2 (0.8% H2O), for 120 min. As a result, a film with Ti3O5 nano- and microfibers layer was prepared. Moreover, the microscale mesh of nano- and microfibers showed greater photoluminescence compared with amorphous TiO2.

3.1.2 Hydrogen reduction of TiO2. Titanium suboxides can also be prepared by hydrogen reduction of TiO2 at high temperature: 
nTiO2(s) + H2(g) = TinO2n−1(s) + H2O(g)
(2)Radecka et al.43 reduced TiO2 pellets by contacting with a mixture of 93% Ar + 7% H2 at 1220–1420 K for 3.5 h to prepare TiO2−x and determined the deviation value x from a change in the mass of pellets before and after reduction. They found that the rutile phase existed for 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.006, before sub-oxides (mainly Ti4O7) appeared. When x surpassed 0.046, the rutile phase disappeared. The optical studies revealed the presence of fundamental absorption edge for slightly reduced samples and the energy band gap of reduced samples increased with an increase in x. TiO2−x with x of about 0.006 exhibited the best photoelectrochemical performance.
Ti4O7 powder was synthesized by reducing anatase TiO2 powder at 1223 K under a pure H2 flow for 4 h. The resulting Ti4O7 powder had a macro-porous structure with an average particle size of 0.5–1 μm, and a specific surface area of 2.7 m2 g−1, as shown in Fig. 8. Ti4O7 powder was then coated on a glassy carbon electrode and tested in concentrated KOH solutions for the ORR (Oxygen Reduction Reaction) and the OER (Oxygen Evolution Reaction) using cyclic voltammetry. The results indicated that this Ti4O7 material was active for the ORR and the OER. In order to test the applicability of this Ti4O7 material in zinc–air rechargeable batteries, a Ti4O7 pellet was made by reducing a TiO2 pellet at 1423 K for 2 h to simulate air-cathode conditions in zinc–air rechargeable batteries, and electrochemical durability tests were carried out in a highly concentrated KOH electrolyte. The results showed Ti4O7 to be a stable material, suggesting that it should be a suitable candidate for air-cathodes in zinc–air batteries.74

Geng et al.75 prepared pure Magnéli Ti4O7 nanotube arrays (NTA) by reducing TiO2 NTA, fabricated by Ti foil anodization in hydrogen atmosphere at 1123 K with a ramping heating rate of 5 K min−1 for 30 minutes. When the treatment lasted for 2 h at 1123 K or for 30 min at 1323 K, TiO phases predominated in reduction products. Magnéli Ti4O7 nanotube arrays had uniform surface morphology with highly ordered tubular structure, as shown in Fig. 9. CV (Cyclic Voltammetry) and EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) analyses showed large electrochemical window and small interfacial charge transfer resistance of Ti4O7 NTA. Pure Ti4O7 NTA displayed a suitability for electro-oxidation applications.

Martyanov et al.76 investigated the oxygen defect and the consequent increase in optical absorption of TiO2 in the visible range during the reduction–reoxidation cycle, which is accompanied by a substantial increase of TiO2 powder's photo-activity in the reaction of acetaldehyde oxidation under visible light. In their experiments, different mixtures of Ti6O11/Ti9O17, Ti4O7/Ti5O9 and Ti3O5/Ti4O7 were obtained, respectively, at 1273, 1373 and 1453 K during a 1 °C min−1 ramp in 4% H2 in Ar. Then, these titanium suboxide mixtures were subjected to reoxidation at a temperature ramp of 1 °C min−1 from room temperature to 1073 K, hold at 1073 K for 2 h, followed by a ramp back to room temperature at 1 K min−1. After this reduction–reoxidation cycle, oxygen defects were proved to be introduced in the TiO2 lattice.
In Kolbrecka and Przyluski's experiments,77 commercial pigment TiO2 were used as the raw material and a mixture of water + isopropanol (1:1) was added to TiO2 to minimize capillary forces in the powder. After drying, a 5 wt% polyethylene oxide (PEO) solution was added as a binder to make disc-shaped TiO2 compact of 44 mm diameter and 5 mm thickness. The discs were sintered in air at 1323 K for 1 day. After removing the oxygen from the furnace, hydrogen was injected into it for four hours to reduce the TiO2 compact to become monophasic Ti4O7 electrodes. In addition, they prepared Ti4O7 electrodes with different pore size distributions by changing the fraction and grain size of TiO2 powder in mixtures with carbon. Voltammetry curves indicated that the Magnéli phases electrodes do not change after a longtime of hydrogen or oxygen evolution in both acidic and basic solutions.77
Recently, it has been demonstrated that titanium suboxides consisting of a Ti8O15 phase can be synthesized at a relatively low temperature of 1073 K by the addition of Co ions as catalyst on TiO2 nanoparticles in H2 or N2 atmosphere. The resulting sample exhibited ∼104 times higher electrical conductivity (1.10 × 10−2 S cm−1). When the titanium suboxide was used as a support to make Pt/TSO, the Pt/TSO showed much improved electrochemical activity and stability for the oxygen reduction reaction.78
Siracusano et al.79 developed a chemical route to prepare titanium suboxides (TinO2n−1) with a Magnéli phase. In this synthesis route, a commercial titanium(IV) chloride solution was dissolved in water and EDTA was added. The reaction mixture was maintained at a pH ∼ 5 at 353 K for 1 h and a colloidal TiOx dispersion was formed by decomposition of the Ti complex with EDTA after adding hydrogen peroxide. After precipitation and subsequent filtering, an amorphous Ti oxide phase was obtained. The amorphous Ti oxides was heated to 1323 K for 2 h under a controlled atmosphere of hydrogen (10%) in argon to prepare Ti-suboxide with a Magnéli phase. Tests of electrochemical activity for oxygen evolution showed proper electronic conductivity for electrocatalysts and superior electrocatalytic activity compared to the commercial support. Besides, in situ cyclic voltammetry and ac-impedance analyses showed larger voltammetric charge and double layer capacitance for the catalyst prepared with these Ti-suboxides.

3.1.3 Metallothermic reduction of TiO2. Thermodynamically, a number of metals, such as calcium, aluminum, sodium, silicon, and even metallic titanium, can be used to reduce titanium dioxide to titanium suboxides. In fact, metallic titanium is an ideal reductant of titanium oxides to obtain versatile titanium suboxides by controlling the ratio of metallic titanium and titanium oxides: 
nTiO2(s) + Me(s) = TinO2n−1(s) + MeO(s)
(3) 
(2n − 1)TiO2(s) + Ti(s) = 2TinO2n−1(s) (n = 1, 2, 3…)
(4)In 1957, Andersson et al.3 mixed titanium sponge and titanium dioxide to synthesize various titanium oxides under argon, and established the various phases for X-ray diffraction data. Similarly, Ti2O3 was prepared by arc melting appropriate amounts of TiO2 and Ti powders at 2273 K in a tri-arc furnace under a purified argon atmosphere. Subsequently, Ti2O3 and V2O3 powders were used to prepare (Ti1−xVx)2O3 single crystals to investigate their magnetic properties.25 Bolokang et al.80 mixed anatase TiO2 and pure Ti powder, pre-milled separately, at 1:1 weight ratio for 30 h at 600 rpm speed and annealed at 1173 K in a tube furnace under argon for 2 h to synthesize metastable face-centered cubic and monoclinic TiOx. Strobel and Page81,82 prepared different TinO2n−1 crystals (2 ≤ n ≤ 9) using different TiOx (1.48 ≤ x ≤ 1.835) as the starting material by Ti reduction by chemical vapor transport process with chlorine and tellurium tetrachloride as the transporting agents to study the crystal structures and physical properties of titanium suboxides. In these processes, controlling the partial pressure of oxygen is a critical parameter not only for crystal growth but also powder preparation.
Kubart et al.83 used different mass ratios of titanium powders and titanium dioxide to prepare TiOx films on Si substrates (x ranging from 0 to 1.75) by a reactive sputtering process. The deposition rate was optimized with respect to the target film composition in a stable hysteresis-free reactive sputtering process.
Gusev et al.84 developed a procedure for the preparation of conducting titanium oxides by reducing rutile with titanium. This process involved preliminary mechanical activation and annealing under argon atmosphere at 1333–1353 K for 4 h instead of the explosive hydrogen reductive medium. Both mono- and multi-phase ceramics of Ti4O7 and Ti6O11 with high conductivity were obtained.
He et al. synthesized Ti8O15 nanowires in a conventional tube furnace. In this process, pure TiO2 powder was placed in the center of the tube and a commercial Ti foil as the substrate was positioned 6 cm away. After the removal of residual oxygen and moisture by N2, they were heated at 1323 K for 2 h and the Magnéli phase Ti8O15 nanowires (NWs) of 30 nm diameter and 2.5 μm length were grown directly on the Ti substrate, as shown in Fig. 10.85 The electrical conductivity of the nanowire was 20.6 S cm−1 at room temperature measured by the practical electrical resistance and the I–V curve of a single Ti8O15 nanowire.

Hauf and Kniep86 reduced anatase and rutile on mica using silicon as the reductant and CaCl2 as an additive to prepare various titanium suboxides under various experimental conditions, such as reaction time, temperature, and gas atmosphere. TinO2n−1 (n = 7–9) and Ti2O3+γ–Ti3O5 + Ti4O7 were obtained with different compositions and colors under different reduction conditions. Anatase on mica was more easily reduced to TinO2n−1 phase since modifications on mica make it metastable and reactivity was enhanced. The color of the TinO2n−1 products depends on the amount and type of titanium suboxides formed. Slightly reduced TiO2 is light blue, whereas more strongly reduced samples display dark blue or bluish-black color. Additionally, CaCl2 can improve the silicothermic reduction: the reaction temperature for the synthesis of blue suboxide powder can be reduced to 1073 K and the amount of silicon can be decreased to one third of the original amount.

3.1.4 Other reduction process. Tang et al.87 presented a method for preparing titanium suboxides made up of Magnéli phases at relatively low temperatures and short reaction time. They successfully produced Ti4O7, Ti5O9 and Ti6O11 by reducing TiO2 in a freshly decomposed ammonia atmosphere at 1223 to 1373 K. Basically, this reduction process is attributed to hydrogen since ammonia decomposed to H2 and N2 at this reduction temperature. Products with different phases Ti9O17, Ti7O13, Ti6O11, Ti5O9, Ti4O7 and Ti3O5 were prepared depending on the reduction temperature and time. Relatively pure Ti4O7 phase was obtained at 1323 K and 3 h. However, the BET surface area of the produced Ti4O7 material was only 1.99 m2 g−1.The preparation of nanoparticles of Ti2O3 is challenging because of the sintering effects at high temperature. Tominaka et al.20,26,46 synthesized nano-sized Ti2O3 by CaH2 reduction of TiO2 at 350 °C over a couple of days. After reaction, samples were washed with a 0.1 M solution of NH4Cl in methanol to remove residual CaH2 and a byproduct CaO. Reduction treatment makes the crystal structure of rutile TiO2 precursor transform to the hexagonal system from the tetragonal system. Then, this method was used to synthesize Ti2O3 nanoparticles with different particle sizes (20, 70, and 300 nm) for systematical investigation of their structural, electrical, and magnetic properties. Compared with bulk of Ti2O3, nanosized Ti2O3 has a lower transition temperature of insulator to metal, 350 K vs. 420 K, and displayed an anisotropic volume contraction and the shrinkage of the nearest neighbor Ti–Ti bond length along the c axis.26
In contrast to the reduction of titanium dioxides by reductants discussed above, plasma sprayed coatings starting from TiO2 feedstock powder usually consist of non-stoichiometric suboxides. Basically, TiO2 starts to lose oxygen at a temperature above 1873 K. The partial pressure of oxygen required to reduce TiO2 to Ti2O3, Ti3O5 or Ti4O7 is of the order of 10−5 Pa at around 2273 K. The oxygen deficient phases of TiO2 (especially Ti3O5 and Ti6O11) are sometimes observed in the coatings by XRD, when the feedstock is an agglomerated titania nanopowder. The formation of non-stoichiometric and oxygen deficient lattice in rutile TiO2 is due to the formation of structural defects.88

3.2 Other raw materials
3.2.1 Metallic titanium. Metallic titanium has a high affinity to oxygen and diverse TiOx phases can be prepared by the oxidation of titanium under an oxygen-containing atmosphere. Verrelli et al.89 fabricated the titanium oxide nanopowders (NPs) by producing Ti NPs via the cluster beam and subsequently sweeping them into an oxygen rich chamber to form a TiOx film on a substrate. Bulk metallic titanium was also used as the titanium source to synthesize blue spherical titanium suboxide nanoparticles by arc plasma under a gas mixture of Ar, H2 and H2O at 10 mbar. Metallic Ti was melted and the atoms flew out of the molten liquid surface after high-density plasma was applied on the bulk titanium. At the same time, H2O was decomposed to release H, OH and O under high temperature and they reacted with titanium atoms to synthesize titanium suboxide nanoparticles particles. The titanium suboxide nanoparticles demonstrated good light absorption. The H2O partial pressure in the mixture gas had noticeable influences on the size, color, composition and optical properties of these nanoparticles.90Metallic titanium target is a typical titanium source for the preparation of titanium a suboxide film by a sputtering and deposition method under different atmospheres. Using RF (radio frequency) reactive magnetron sputtering, Banakh et al.45 synthesized a golden yellow TiO film with a NaCl-type crystalline structure at 523 K by controlling the partial pressure of reactive gas oxygen or water. In order to improve the stability of the golden yellow TiO film synthesized by reactive dc magnetron sputtering, Li et al.91 used ICP (inductively coupled plasma)-assisted reactive dc magnetron sputtering method on unheated glass substrate below 473 K. The color of TiO nanocrystalline film remarkably depended on the oxygen partial pressure, ranging from light yellow to dark yellow. However, annealing of the golden yellow titanium monoxide film above 873 K in the open air oxidized to include rutile-type titanium dioxide.91 Leng et al.92 compared the pulsed vacuum arc plasma deposition method with the unbalanced magnetron (UBM) sputtering deposition method for the preparation of the TiOx film on Si (100) substrates using a Ti target in an Ar + O2 atmosphere. The TiOx films synthesized by these two methods contain the rutile phase and have a similar composition, but with different grain size and roughness. Martev93 used an oxygen-ion-assisted physical vapor deposition process in which a 99.9%-pure titanium target was used as the anode and a hot-tungsten filament served as the source of electrons for heating the titanium and for gas ionization. By controlling the oxygen partial pressure in the reactor, FCC-TiO film was deposited. Chen et al.94 deposited various thin films of TiOx with a wide range of oxygen atomic ratios (x) from 0.08 to 2.2 by radio-frequency, reactive magnetron sputtering under ultra-high vacuum back-ground and Ar–O2 sputtering atmospheres with controlling and increasing O2 supply flow using optical emission feedback monitoring system.
Huryn et al.95 investigated phase changes in the carbooxidation process of titanium using carbon, such as graphite, charcoal or carbon black, as the C source and oxygen as the O sources fed into the working chamber of the furnace to provide different oxygen partial pressures. The phase composition of the surface layers of titanium after saturation with graphite at 1173 K at a partial pressure of oxygen of 10−2 Pa included Ti3O5, TiO, Ti5O9 and Ti2O, TiCxOy and TiC.

3.2.2 Inorganotitanium chemicals. Shah et al.96 developed a facile hydrothermal approach to prepare defective TiO2−x nanocrystals using TiCl3 as a precursor and L-ascorbic acid as reductant and structure direction agent. The prepared TiO2−x nanocrystals are of core–shell structure, TiO2 core and a disordered TiO2−x outer layer, and a pure anatase phase. Increasing the amount of L-ascorbic acid from 0, 0.3 to 0.7 g in 80 mL solution had the particle size of highly crystallized TiO2 core gradually decreased from 50 nm to 10 nm and color of sample changed to be white, brown and black. However, their investigation confirmed no any Ti3+ existing on particle structure, except for the presence of high concentration oxygen vacancy on the disorder shell layer.TiH2 powders were also employed as precursors to synthesize TiO2−x nanoparticles by adding the oxidant H2O2 solution. But anatase and rutile phases dominated in product samples and XPS results indicated samples were Ti3+ self-doped TiO2.63,64
H2Ti3O7 nano-belts were reduced under flowing ethane and hydrogen at 1187 K for 2 h to synthesize graphitic carbon-coated and non-coated Magnéli-phase Ti9O17 nanobelts by Han et al.97 Recently, rutile-phase H2TiO3 (<500 nm) was used to synthesize the nano-Magnéli phase in different atmosphere by thermal plasma in this laboratory. Shining blue and black spherical Magnéli phase particles of 20–100 nm were obtained, as shown in Fig. 11.

3.2.3 Organotitanium chemicals. Ti acetyl-acetonate was used as the titanium source to synthesize the Magnéli phases of TinO2n−1 by a sol–gel process with the addition of carbon cryogel combined with heat-treatment at 873 K in argon flow.98 Portehault et al.99 obtained multiple TinO2n−1 compounds (n = 3, 4, 5, 6, 8) as nano-Magnéli crystalline phases with specific surface areas from 55 to 300 m2 g−1 by a sol–gel and calcination process using titanium tetraethoxide as the titanium source. Subsequently, a SPS (Spark Plasma Sintering) process was combined with a sol–gel process to form percolated nanocomposites based on metal oxide nanoparticles embedded in a carbon matrix. The Ti4O7 sample had a low electrical resistivity of 2 × 10−4 Ω m and thermal conductivity of 1 W m K−1.Teleki et al.100 synthesize blue titanium suboxide nanoparticles by the oxidation of TTIP (titanium-tetra-isopropoxide) vapor at atmospheric pressure in an atmospheric co-flow diffusion flame reactor.101 By placing rapid quenching of the flame with a critical flow nozzle, the blue coloration, particle size and band gap energy of titanium suboxides could be controlled. Furthermore, the blue color of the titanium suboxide nanopowders could be further enhanced and protected to withstand oxidation at high temperatures after applying in situ SiO2-coating by the co-oxidation of TTIP with hexamethyldisiloxane during particle formation in these flames. Recently, Conze et al.102 used TTIP and glycerol to prepare the (O,O)-precursor, which was pyrolyzed to prepare nanocomposites of Magnéli phases Ti4O7/C and Ti8O15/C at various temperatures between 623 K and 1323 K under argon.
Maneeratana et al.103 fabricated continuous fibers by the electrospinning of viscous hybrid solutions of titanium ethoxide in ethanol mixed with poly ethylene imine (PEI) or poly ethylene glycol (PEG), leading to polymer-oxo-titanium hybrids, named respectively PEI–Ti and PEG–Ti. Consequently, these fibers were heated to cause carbothermic reduction of titania in polymer-oxo-titanium hybrids above 1073 K under N2 atmosphere and yield different Magnéli phases, such as Ti4O7, Ti8O15, Ti6O11 and Ti5O9, as shown in Fig. 12. Especially for PEI–Ti, pure Ti8O15 phase fiber was obtained by heat treatment at 1173 K. For the PEI–Ti system, SEM showed the appearance of a 500 nm thick outer shell and 5 μm inner wall core on the fibers. Upon heating to 1173 K and 1273 K, the particles constituting the outer part expanded, and the shell evolved from a jagged texture to a smoother appearance. This work contributed to the combination of sol–gel chemistry and the electrospinning process to shape nanostructured Magnéli phase materials with efficient control over composition, texture and nanostructure. This method provides an easier way to design and prepare Magnéli-fiber based membranes, fleeces and tissues.

Recently, Rai et al.104 used 2-methoxyethanol, ethanolamine and titanium(IV) isopropoxide to make amorphous titanium suboxide (ATO) sol–gel precursor and converted its solution into ATO films with a Ti:O ratio of ∼1:1.5 through hydrolysis. Ertekin and his coworkers105 prepared Magnéli phase titanium oxide films by cathodic electrodeposition on indium-tin-oxide coated glass substrates from saturated a peroxo-titanium solution in acetonitrile made by TiOSO4 and 30% H2O2 at lower than 40 °C without any heat treatment. Moreover, different crystalline TinO2n−1 films (γ-Ti3O5, λ-Ti3O5, Ti4O7 and Ti5O9) were prepared under different cathodic potential values.

4 Application of titanium suboxides
TinO2n−1 has been one of potential materials in diverse fields, such as chemical catalysts, pollutant degradation, electronic and optoelectronic devices, etc., because their unique serial structures and properties.
4.1 Chemical catalysts
Magnéli phase titanium oxides are considered as the most promising substitute of carbon supports in the catalytic materials because of their enhancement of catalytic activity, high stability, and high oxidation and corrosion resistances.
Reza et al.106 synthesized various Pt/TiOx–C catalysts by changing the temperature of synthesis of the TiOx support. The Pt/TiOx–C prepared at 1273 K displayed a higher specific mass activity compared to the commercial Pt/Vulcan catalyst. It enhances the catalyst stability and is highly methanol tolerant for DMFC (direct methanol fuel cells) application. TiOx suboxide hybrid supports are considered as an alternative to overcome the carbon corrosion problem in PEMFC (polymer electron membrane fuel cells) and DMFC. Zhao et al.107 used Ti4O7 as a support of Pt electro-catalysts and compared electrical performances of different supports (i.e. Ti4O7, TiO2 and carbon black) for direct formic acid fuel cells (DFAFCs). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and chronoamperometry (CA) results showed the Pt/Ti4O7 catalyst to possess better catalytic activity and stability.
Ioroi et al.108 made substoichiometric titanium oxide (Ti4O7)-supported Pt catalysts and compared their electrochemical properties with those of Pt/C catalysts. Pt/Ti4O7 cathode shows a similar activity for the oxygen reduction reaction as Pt/C catalyst at 353 K and remains quite stable against high potential up to 1.5 V, as shown in Fig. 13. Voltage stability for >350 h with H2/O2 was also demonstrated when a Pt/Ti4O7 cathode was used as a single cell, as shown in Fig. 14.
 Fig. 13  SEM images of 5% Pt/Ti4O7 cathode (a) and (b) at the initial state; (c) and (d) after potential holding tests in O2 at 1.0–1.5 V vs. anode for 1 h at each potential.

Ebonex® was also used as a supports to make an Ebonex®/Pt catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction in a 0.5 mol dm−3 HClO4 solution. The synthesized catalyst, in comparison with polycrystalline Pt, showed 10 times enhancement in oxygen reduction activity expressed through the specific current densities obtained at the constant potential.109 Similarly, the electrochemical properties of the Ti8O15 nanowires were tested by loading Pt nanoparticles as catalysts for methanol oxidation reaction. The Pt/Ti8O15 NW catalyst showed an enhanced activity and extraordinarily high durability for direct methanol oxidation compared with commercial Pt/C catalysts.85
Slavcheva et al.110 synthesized PtCo/Ebonex® catalyst using Ebonex® as supports and it showed better catalytic efficiency towards oxygen evolution than Pt/Ebonex® and unsupported PtCo on working electrodes in aqueous solution of 20% KOH at room temperature for water splitting application.
Liu et al. added different amounts of TiOx nanoparticles to modify Pt90Au10/C catalysts for Oxidation Reduction Reaction (ORR) by a facile chemical method and a suboxide layer was formed on the PtAu catalysts surface. After 1700 cycles accelerated durability test (ADT), the ORR activity of PtAu/C catalysts with 3 wt% TiOx was 2.7 and 3.8 times higher than that of the commercial Pt/C and PtAu catalysts, respectively.111
4.2 Remediation of environment
Fujiwara et al.112 used silver acetate and titanium isopropoxide as silver and titanium precursors, respectively, to prepare TiO2 NPs containing titanium suboxide layers loaded with 10 or 20 wt% of Ag (10Ag/TiO2 or 20Ag/TiO2) by the flame aerosol technology. Their photophysical and photocatalytic performance indicated these nanoparticles cause rapid photodegradation of Cr6+ and methylene blue (below 50% in 15 min for MB).
Dieckmann and Langer113 compared the performance of platinum and nickel on supported carbon and Ebonex® catalysts on the electrogenerative oxidation of simple aliphatic and aromatic alcohols and formaldehyde in sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide electrolytes. The Ebonex® support enhanced the activity of the supported nickel catalyst, especially effective for formaldehyde oxidation. Chen et al.'s114 research indicated that trichloroethylene (TCE) was rapidly oxidized to CO and CO2 on an Ebonex® ceramic anode surface in acid pH range. On electrochemical oxidation of phenol organic pollutants, Geng et al.75 applied Ti4O7 nanotube arrays (NTA) to the electro-oxidation of phenol and reported that the COD removal was 1.2 times that of Ti4O7 particles. Magnéli Ti4O7 NTA also displayed a higher degradation coefficient, COD removal as well as current efficiency compared with boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrode and other types of Magnéli NTAs, as shown in Fig. 15. However, Grimm et al.115 tested a variety of different electrode materials (Ebonex®, Ebonex®/PbO2, Ti/SnO2) as oxidation catalysts for their catalytic potential in waste waters. The Ebonex®/PbO2-electrodes did not show a separated oxidation peak. The electrochemical characteristics of the electrode material Ebonex® is not significantly changed by the addition of phenol to the electrolyte.

Scott and coworkers116–118 used Ebonex® as the cathode material in a small pilot scale sieve-plate electrochemical reactor (SPER) for the oxidation and recovery of SO2 gas to produce sulfuric acid. Ebonex® material can avoid forming sulfur in the electrolysis of SO2 and increase the current efficiency in solutions of sulfuric acid. Later, they tested the electrochemical performances of Ebonex® anode electrode for the electroreduction synthesis of glyoxylic acid from oxalic acid. The results indicated it displayed an anodic behavior similar to that of Pt/Ti, especially in a 0.1 M (HOOC)2 + 0.1 M or 1 M H2SO4 electrolyte solution and should be good candidate for an effective anode in an undivided cell electrolysis.119
4.3 Electronic and optoelectronic applications
Titanium suboxides, as the more stable electrode and high-κ materials (κ is dielectric constant), have been employed as coatings and supports in various electronic and optoelectronic devices.
Farndon et al.120 investigated cyclic voltammetry curves of Fe(CN)63−/Fe(CN)64− in 1 M KC1 and 1 M NaOH, Ce(IV)/Ce(III) in 3 M CH3SO3H and Ag(I)/Ag(II) in 3 M HNO3 using Pt/Ebonex® electrodes obtained by electrodeposition from a Pt 5Q solution (containing 16 mM Pt(NH3)4HPO4 (5 g L−1 Pt) + ≈30 mM solution phosphate buffer, pH 10.6) at 368 K.121 The results showed that their performances are stable and similar to that of bulk Pt.
Rai et al.104 doped amorphous titanium suboxide (ATO) as the “high-κ dopant” on monolayer (ML) molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), shown in Fig. 16, and achieved a contact resistance of ∼180 Ω μm that is the lowest reported value for ML MoS2. An on-current as high as 240 μA μm−1 and field effect mobility as high as 83 cm2 V−1 s−1 were realized, as shown in Fig. 17. Moreover, intrinsic mobility values as high as 102 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 300 K and 501 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 77 K were achieved after ATO encapsulation that are among the highest mobility values reported on ML MoS2, as shown in Fig. 18.

Verrelli et al.89 deposited titanium oxide nanoparticle films with thicknesses in the range 50–300 nm on the metal insulator–metal (MIM) diodes with Au top and bottom electrodes, as shown in Fig. 19. The arrangement showed switching voltages well below 1 V with high-to-low resistance ratios in the range 10–1000.

Lee et al.122 assembled an efficient and air-stable small-molecule bulk heterojunction (SM BHJ) solar cells by introducing titanium suboxides between the active layer and the cathode as an electric adhesive layer. The major results of solar cell performance indicated that the TiOx interlayer improved power conversion efficiency by 6.4% as well as greatly enhanced device lifetime.
Seo et al.123 built an artificial symmetry breaking by introducing titanium suboxide in solar cell structure shown in Fig. 20 and investigated the importance of symmetry breaking in polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. The TiOx induced an interfacial dipole at the organic semiconductor/metal interfaces that modified the effective work functions (WFs) and improved the contact at the interface.

A similar organic solar cell structure was built by Lee and coworkers124 to determine the role of the TiOx layer compared with that without TiOx layer. Test results indicated that the TiOx layer increases the energy barrier for hole transport and reduces the minority carrier density. Roy et al.125 found an appropriate choice of the BHJ thickness and composition, and showed that the TiOx layer can enhance the absorption within the active layer, thereby increasing the photocurrent and the power conversion efficiency.
In order to improve the low power conversion efficiency (PCE) resulting from the low charge selectivity of CNTs in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVCS) application, Jin et al.126 made the coating of an ultrathin layer of titanium suboxide (TiOx) on CNTs as a hole injection barrier, as shown in Fig. 21. Therefore, TiOx-coated CNTs can provide electrons with an extremely fast conductive path through CNTs and selectively block the holes by means of the hole-barrier property of the TiOx coating.

4.4 Batteries
Carbon materials are not stable enough for air–cathodes in metal–air rechargeable batteries due to its corrosion in the presence of O2 and H2O2, and at high electrode potentials. Therefore, developing more stable non-carbon support materials for air-cathodes seems necessary. In recent years, conductive Magnéli phase materials have been explored as electrode materials or conductive supports in electrochemical systems, including fuel cells, because of their high conductivities and relatively high corrosion-resistivity in aggressively acidic and alkaline electrolytes.
Kao et al.127 used Ebonex® powders as additives to improve the formation efficiency of a positive plate in the lead/acid environment. Loyns et al.128 made composite-laminate form of the Ebonex® material as a bipolar substrate, as shown in Fig. 22, and assembled bipolar lead–acid batteries. The test results of battery properties showed after 75 cycles both sides of the interface were in good condition with good adhesion to the Ebonex® powder/resin composite substrate. The use of Ebonex® composite material as a bipolar substrate could provide lightweight and durable high-voltage lead–acid batteries suitable for a wide range of applications including advanced automotive, stationary power and portable equipment, as shown in Fig. 23.

Tao et al.130 obtained Ti6O11 and Ti4O7 nanopowders by hydrogen reduction of titanium dioxide nanotubes and used them as the matrix to bind with sulfur species to prepare the lithium–sulfur batteries cathode. The Ti4O7–S cathodes exhibit higher reversible capacity and improved cycling performance with high specific capacities of 1342, 1044, and 623 mA h g−1 at 0.02, 0.1, and 0.5C, respectively, and remarkable capacity retention of 99% (100 cycles at 0.1C), as shown in Fig. 24.

Density functional theory calculations and experimental characterizations confirmed strong adsorption of sulfur species on the low-coordinated Ti sites of Ti4O7 attributed to the properties of Ti4O7–S. In Pang et al.'s work,131 Ti4O7/S cathodes provided a discharge capacity of 1070 mA h g−1 at 5C, a doubling in capacity retention with respect to a typical conductive carbon electrode and a stable high-rate cycle performance at 2C over 500 cycles. Besides, Ti3O5 powder was added into lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) cathode electrodes in lithium-ion batteries and it exhibited a better rate capability (170.9 mA h g−1 at 0.1C) and a more homogeneous dispersion than acetylene black among the LiFePO4 particles during the cycles. This improvement was attributed to a layer of titanium oxide yarn-like thin film discovered coating on the LiFePO4 particles of the cathode electrode.132 On the other, when carbon-coated Ti9O17 nanobelts were used as the anode, an initial reversible capacity of 182 mA h g−1 was attained. Cyclic voltammetry revealed pseudocapacitive lithium-storage behavior of Magnéli-phase Ti9O17 nanobelts and they have high power-density with excellent cycling stability in their application as hybrid electrochemical cells.97
4.5 Others
Titanium suboxides can also improve mechanical properties as coatings of certain materials. Thermally sprayed TiOx-based cylinder liner coatings were used to substitute grey cast iron liner and deposited on aluminium liners to increase their tribological performance.133 Magnéli phase materials were used as coatings on Al–Mg alloy substrates prepared by plasma thermal spray method to enhance anti-wear properties of the alloy substrates. The test indicated sub-stoichiometric coatings offer the possibility of reducing wear in dry sliding applications compared to sprayed TiO2 coatings.134
5 Summary and prospective
In the past decades, there has been plenty of research focusing on the crystal structure, synthesis methods, physical and chemical properties, and applications of various titanium suboxides and modified titanium oxides. Since 2011, Ti3+ self-doping titanium oxides nanomaterials with different colors have been attracting tremendous interest, sparked by work of Chen et al.,13,135,136 because of their outstanding unique photochemical, photocatalytic and electrical properties with existence of oxygen vacancies and structural disorder.137–148 The capacity for continuous oxygen removal of titanium dioxide accompanying crystal structure vitalize titanium suboxides with diverse superior performances in photocatalytic, photoelectrical, electrical, magnetic and environmental fields, especially for Magnéli phase titanium suboxides. In practice, different synthesis methods and conditions have brought different properties to titanium oxides. Much more efforts are needed from synthesis to property characterization, and application of titanium suboxides including Ti3+ doping titanium oxides, especially in electronic devices, renewable energy, and environment. Besides, further work about mechanism understanding titanium suboxides should be done in the future by means of experimental and calculation methods. The future prospect is high that these titanium oxides will be developed to provide indispensable materials in various fields.
