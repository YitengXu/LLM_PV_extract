    , Accepted 19th August 2015First published on 20th August 2015AbstractWe report a theoretical analysis on the crystallization of CH3NH3PbI3 and the control of grain sizes by varying the two-step reaction temperature from −10 °C to 50 °C based on the present analysis. The thermodynamic equation for CH3NH3PbI3 crystallization is derived by considering the change in Gibbs free energy and the equilibrium concentration of the reaction between the PbI2 film and CH3NH3I solution. The photovoltaic performance of a perovskite solar cell is found to depend on the reaction temperature, which is critical in determining the crystal size of perovskite. The reaction temperature was varied between −10 °C and 50 °C, and the optimal temperature was found to be around 20 °C in our two-step process. The performance enhancement controlled by the grain size with the increase of reaction temperature could be compensated by the generation of defects for a large crystal perovskite layer device.
Introduction
Research on solid-state perovskite solar cells based on the light harvester, methylammonium lead iodide, MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3), has received considerable attention due to their low-cost technology, ease of processing and excellent photovoltaic performances. Following the first report on a 9.7% efficient perovskite solar cell in 2012,1 the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device has been developed during a number of studies.2–5 As a result, a PCE of 20.1% was reported in 2014,6 which is the highest certified value among organometal halide perovskite solar cells. Solution-processed techniques using one-step7,8/two-step3,9 and vapor deposition methods10 have been proposed to improve the potential performance of the perovskite solar cells. In particular, a two-step solution process, which involves sequential deposition of PbI2 and MAI reacting readily to form MAPbI3, has been used due to the possibility of controlling the fabricated MAPbI3 grain sizes.11–13 It is important to note that the grain sizes of the perovskite active layer affect the photovoltaic performances.14–16 It was reported that MAPbI3 grain sizes could be controlled by changing the MAI concentration, which led to enhancement of the properties of the solar cell device.9 However, there are many other factors, such as temperature, surface tension and humidity, that affect the performances of perovskite solar cells by engineering the MAPbI3 grain sizes.15,17,18
Herein, we report a fundamental analysis using a thermodynamic equation and temperature-controlled two-step solution engineering, which was used to investigate the correlation of the MAPbI3 grain sizes with reaction temperature. Deriving a thermodynamic reaction model equation from Gibbs free energy, we demonstrate that the grain sizes of the MAPbI3 active layer can be controlled not only by the MAI concentration but also by the reaction temperature of a two-step process that involves spin-coating MAI on the PbI2 film. It is found that the temperature in the two-step coating process is crucial in determining the MAPbI3 grain sizes and the performance of fabricated solar cells. While we were preparing our manuscript on the temperature-dependent crystal growth mechanism, a similar study was recently reported on temperature-dependent perovskite morphology.19 However, this did not include the theoretical analysis to support the basis for the temperature-dependent crystal growth.
Results and discussion
The fabrication process for MAPbI3 perovskite solar cells using a two-step spin coating method is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. To form the PbI2 crystallized film, 1 M N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution of PbI2 is spin-coated on the mp-TiO2/bl-TiO2/FTO substrate, where mp and bl stand for mesoporous and blocking, and annealed on a hot plate, as shown in Fig. 1a. Subsequently, MAI solution in 2-propanol is spread on a PbI2 film to crystallize MAPbI3 perovskite (Fig. 1b).20,21
 Fig. 1  Schematic of the fabrication process for perovskite solar cells using a two-step spin-coated method. (a) First, PbI2 solution (1 M in DMF) was spin-coated on a mesoporous (mp)-TiO2 layer deposited on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate with a thin blocking (bl)-TiO2 film, followed by annealing to form the PbI2 film. (b) Second, MAI solution (0.05 M in 2-propanol) was loaded onto the PbI2 film to crystallize MAPbI3 perovskite and then spun after 30 s. (b1) MAPbI3 nuclei were formed, whereas MAI solute molecules constantly collided with the PbI2 film. (b2) MAPbI3 nuclei selectively grew, based on a statistical thermodynamic model. (c) Finally, spiro-MeOTAD was spin-coated on the MAPbI3 film and an Au electrode was thermally evaporated to complete the solar cell. 
The chemical reaction to form MAPbI3 in a two-step procedure can be expressed as eqn (1), PbI2 (s) + MAI (sol) ↔ MAPbI3 (s)(1)where the MAI concentration in 2-propanol determines the direction of the chemical reaction. Higher MAI concentrations will push the reaction to the right due to a shift of equilibrium, leading to crystallization of perovskite. In the process of forming perovskite, MAI constantly collides with solid PbI2, which leads to the formation of MAPbI3 nuclei according to the probabilistic model. Then, the minute nuclei, which have enough energy for crystallization, can selectively grow bigger according to a thermodynamic model. The change in Gibbs free energy per unit volume (ΔGV) with a thermodynamic mechanism of crystallization is calculated using eqn (2),22 (2)where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature of the reaction, C is the concentration of MAI, C0 is the equilibrium concentration of MAI, and Vm is the volume of a solute particle. C0 depends on temperature. When crystallization occurs in the solution phase, the change in Gibbs free energy and the surface tension between the surface of the crystal and the solution (ΔGS) should be considered together, and the relationship between them can be written as eqn (3), (3)where  is the average surface tension. Because MAPbI3 perovskite is a tetragonal structure at room temperature,23 the shape of MAPbI3 can be assumed to be cubic. The total change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the two-step solution process is thus expressed as eqn (4), (4)where a is the length of the cubic edge, a3 is the volume of the cube, and 6a2 is the total surface area of the cube. By differentiating eqn (4) with respect to a, a critical point wherein ΔG is maximized can be calculated by solving eqn (5). (5)using eqn (5), the critical size (ac) and the critical Gibbs free energy (ΔGc) are expressed as eqn (6) and (7). (6) (7)
The change in Gibbs free energy is presented as a function of the size of the perovskite crystal in Fig. 2a, wherein it is noted that Gibbs free energy is predominantly affected by surface tension. Gibbs free energy increases when the size of the perovskite crystal is smaller than the critical size, whereas it decreases when the size of the perovskite crystal is larger than the critical size. Consequently, perovskite nuclei, which have higher energy than the critical energy, are expected to grow as a result of a spontaneous chemical reaction. As a result, the perovskite crystal would grow until all PbI2 are turned into perovskite. Therefore, the average grain size of MAPbI3 is controlled by two factors: (1) the crystal growth of perovskite is determined by the critical energy (Gc) and (2) each nucleus will spontaneously grow until it comes into contact with surrounding crystals at grain boundaries. Because the energy distributions of the reactants follow a Boltzmann distribution based on statistical thermodynamics, the number of nuclei that have the potential to become crystals is proportional to .24 The average volume of a perovskite crystal is inversely proportional to the number of nuclei (n) per unit volume because an increase in the number of nuclei inhibits crystal growth due to the decreased space available for crystal growth. Therefore, the grain size (Y) has the following relation. (8)

From eqn (7) and relation (8), we can derive the interaction formula between grain size and MAI concentration in eqn (9) (see more details in ESI†), (9)where X is the MAI concentration that is equal to C and C′ is a constant. It is demonstrated that eqn (9) correctly predicts grain sizes depending on MAI concentrations, which were measured previously elsewhere,9 as shown in Fig. 3 (see ESI† for more details). Top-view and cross-sectional SEM images of MAPbI3 are shown in Fig. 2b and c. It is clearly shown that the grain sizes are different for differing MAI concentrations.

According to eqn (9), the MAPbI3 crystal size is controlled not only by the concentration of MAI but also by temperature. To see the temperature effect, both the substrate and the MAI solution are pre-heated at different temperatures of −10 °C, 20 °C and 50 °C, in which the MAI concentration is fixed at 0.050 M. As shown in the SEM images in Fig. 4a–f, the grain size increases as temperature increases. As the temperature of the MAI solution increases, the equilibrium concentration of the chemical reaction also increases due to the high solubility of MAI. Therefore, the critical free energy at high temperatures is higher than that at low temperatures according to eqn (7), which determines the number of nuclei based on relation (8). As a result, the number of nuclei growing into MAPbI3 crystals decreased, which leads to an increase in the MAPbI3 grain sizes. Top-view SEM images (Fig. 4a, c and e) and cross-sectional FIB-SEM images (Fig. 4b, d and f) clearly show that the MAPbI3 grain size changes with temperature, which can be explained by our theoretical analysis using eqn (9). It is noted that MAPbI3 grown at 50 °C shows large gaps between crystals, which causes direct contact between mp-TiO2 and spiro-MeOTAD.

The effect of reaction temperature on photovoltaic parameters is investigated. Fig. 5 shows the measurement results for different reaction temperatures with short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE). As can be seen in Fig. 5a, Jsc is improved as the reaction temperature increases, which may be due to an increase in light absorption as a result of an increase in grain size (see Fig. 6). It is noted that the corresponding perovskite colors becomes darker with increasing grain size (see Fig. S1 in ESI†). On the other hand, significantly lowered Voc and FF are observed at 50 °C (Fig. 5b), which is probably related to the defects in the perovskite layer, as shown in Fig. 4f. The defects caused by increasing grain size provide recombination sites between mp-TiO2 and spiro-MeOTAD. Voc and FF will be dependant on the thickness of the mp-TiO2 layer and the whole perovskite layer. These are slightly improved at 20 °C compared to −10 °C because of the higher densities of the compressed mp-TiO2 layer (∼250 nm) and the whole perovskite layer (∼450 nm), which are thinner than those at −10 °C (∼400 nm and ∼600 nm, respectively), as shown in Fig. 4d. It is assumed that the compressed mesoporous TiO2 layer results from the volume expansion of MAPbI3 capped on the mesoporous TiO2 layer, due to the increase in the MAI solution temperature. As a result, PCE is highest for a reaction temperature of 20 °C. The photovoltaic parameters for the best performing devices are represented in Table 1.

Fig. 6a shows that the absorbance is higher at 20 °C and 50 °C than at −10 °C. A decrease in absorbance with decreasing grain size was observed in the earlier study,9 which is in part related to the higher reflectance. The relatively low absorbance of MAPbI3 grown at −10 °C results from a smaller grain size. Large crystals with gaps between them are beneficial to the external quantum efficiency (EQE), especially at long wavelengths (Fig. 6b), due to enhanced internal light scattering, which is responsible for a higher Jsc at 50 °C.
Conclusions
We presented a theoretical approach using a thermodynamic analysis derived from Gibbs free energy to explain the crystal growth of MAPbI3 and found that the grain size of MAPbI3 crystals was clearly dependent on the reaction temperature. The grain size increased with reaction temperature, which could be explained by the thermodynamic model. The photovoltaic performance was significantly altered by the reaction temperature, which was mainly due to the MAPbI3 grain size and the morphology of the resultant MAPbI3 film. MAPbI3 grown at 20 °C showed a better performance compared to the same compound grown at lower or higher reaction temperatures.
Experimental section
Materials synthesis
Mesoporous 50 nm-sized TiO2 nanoparticles were hydrothermally synthesized using 20 nm-sized seed particles as described elsewhere.25 1.4 g of TiO2 paste, which consists of nanocrystalline TiO2, terpineol, ethylcellulose and lauric acid with a nominal ratio of 1.25:6:0.9:0.3 wt%, was diluted in 10 ml ethanol to prepare a mesoporous TiO2 film. MAI was synthesized by reacting 27.8 ml of CH3NH2 (40 wt% in methanol, TCI) with 30 ml of HI (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) in a round bottomed flask in an ice bath for 2 h.20,26 Using a rotary evaporator, the resulting MAI was collected at 50 °C for 1 h. This was washed with diethyl ether and dried in a vacuum chamber for 12 h.
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
Fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated (FTO) glass substrate (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8 Ω sq−1) was cleaned using UV/ozone treatment for 15 min and sonicated in ethanol after washing with detergent liquid, acetone and DI water. A thin compact TiO2 blocking (bl) layer was deposited on FTO by spin-coating 0.15 M titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (Sigma-Aldrich, 75 wt% in isopropanol) in 1-butanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%) at a sequentially increasing spin rate of 700 rpm for 8 s, 1000 rpm for 10 s and 2000 rpm for 40 s. The bl-TiO2 layer was heated at 125 °C for 5 min. A mesoporous (mp) TiO2 layer was formed on the bl-TiO2 layer by spin-coating the diluted TiO2 paste solution at 2000 rpm for 20 s and annealing at 550 °C for 1 h. After UV/ozone treatment for 30 min, the substrate was treated with 20 mM aqueous TiCl4 (Sigma-Aldrich, >98%) by immersing the mp-TiO2 coated substrate at 90 °C for 10 min, followed by annealing again at 500 °C for 30 min. The deposition of the MAPbI3 perovskite active layer on the mp-TiO2 layer was conducted using a two-step process. Firstly, 30 μl of PbI2 solution (1 M (1.844 g) of PbI2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) dissolved in 4 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%)) was spin-coated on the mp-TiO2 coated substrate at 6000 rpm for 20 s, which was dried at 40 °C for 3 min and 100 °C for 5 min. Second, 200 μl of 0.05 M (8 mg ml−1) MAI in 2-propanol (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%) was spin-coated on the PbI2 film at 3000 rpm for 20 s during 30 s of loading time to allow MAPbI3 crystallization and was dried at 100 °C for 5 min. Prior to the MAI coating process, the three MAI solutions with different temperatures of −10 °C (in a dry ice chamber), 20 °C (room temperature) and 50 °C (using a pre-heated hot plate) were prepared. The hole transport material (HTM) was deposited on the substrate by spin-coating 72.3 mg of spiro-MeOTAD solution in 1 ml chlorobenzene, to which 28.8 μl of 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 17.5 μl of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg Li-TSFI in 1 ml acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.8%)) was added, at 4000 rpm for 20 s. Finally, gold (Au) was thermally evaporated on the top of the HTM for the counter electrode under ∼10−6 Torr vacuum at ∼1 Å s−1.
Characterization
The morphologies of the MAPbI3 layer and the fabricated perovskite solar cells were examined using a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (HR SEM, JSM-7600F, JEOL) and a focused ion beam assisted SEM (FIB-SEM, Auriga, Carl Zeiss). To avoid a charging effect, a 10 nm-thick Pt layer was deposited on the top of the substrate. The absorbance of the MAPbI3 perovskite active layer was analyzed using a UV/Vis spectrometer (Lambda 45, Perkin-Elmer) in the wavelength range from 500 to 900 nm. Photocurrent density–voltage curves were recorded using a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A class AAA) equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp (Newport 6279NS) and a Keithley's series 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). An aperture mask was used while measuring the devices in reverse scan mode at 200 ms scan rate. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using a specially designed EQE system (PV measurement Inc.), wherein a 75 W xenon lamp (USHIO, Japan) was used as a light source to generate a monochromatic beam.
