Especially, the excess amount of nitrogen compounds in the waste are difficult to treat or decompose for the purpose of discarding into the environment or recycling as useful compounds. In Nature the carbon/nitrogen cycle maintains material balance. Carbon waste can be converted into methane (fuel) by methane fermentation, which is regarded as one of the promising methods to create renewable energy from biomass waste. However, nitrogen compounds contained in the livestock waste are now becoming a serious pollutant for the environment, which should be solved urgently. Since nitrogen compounds can be converted finally to ammonia by enzymes such as urease in livestock wastes, if ammonia is converted to harmless or useful compounds, it can solve the livestock waste problem. In addition to this, ammonia is now attracting a great deal of attention as an energy storage material for H2 fuel cells instead of H2 that requires high pressure and large volume for storage.TiO2 photoanode was found to photoelectrochemically decompose water under UV light irradiation,1 and since then many organic and inorganic compounds have been decomposed by this photocatalyst.2–4 Photodecomposition of ammonia has also been reported, but the products were not N2/H2. The photodecomposition of ammonia in neutral water has been reported by using TiO2-supported Pt or Pd catalyst, but only N2 and nitrogen oxides were obtained.5 TiO2/Pt decomposed aqueous ammonia into N2, while pure TiO2 decomposed NH3 into nitrite and nitrate.6 In these reports hydrogen formation was not reported. Some reports are found on photodecomposition of ammonia with TiO2 in a gas phase.7,8 However, to our knowledge, photochemical conversion of aqueous ammonia into N2/H2 has not been reported yet. The present authors have found that an aqueous solution of ammonia can be photochemically converted into N2/H2 if reacted under alkaline conditions and in a stoichiometric 1∶3 (N2∶H2) molar ratio by using platinized titanium dioxide (TiO2) suspension. This could lead to a future artificial nitrogen cycle driven by solar irradiation. Very interestingly, our further investigation showed that the system can lead to a new concept of a photofuel cell in which ammonia serves as a fuel, the light irradiation induces decomposition of the fuel, and so photocurrent is produced in addition to the N2/H2 production. The first fundamental results are reported in this paper.TiO2
				(ST-01,average size 7 nm, from Ishihara Sangyo Co.Ltd.) was platinized by photochemially reducing tetrachloroplatinate in a TiO2–water suspension in the presence of 2 wt% methanol. The platinized TiO2 powders (TiO2–Pt)
				(10 mg) with 1 wt% Pt were suspended in a 5 ml aqueous solution of 1 wt% ammonia (pH 12.3) in a 10 ml cylindrical cell. The cell was sealed after bubbling argon gas into the water for 30 min, and then the suspension was irradiated with a 500 W xenon lamp (intensity 102 or 469 mW cm−2). The products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC4C-PT) with a 13X-D molecular sieve column at 80 °C using argon carrier gas. N2 and H2 were produced by irradiation with nearly in the stoichiometric 3∶1 ratio (H2/N2
				= 3.4/1 molar ratio) with a slight excess of H2. The slight excess of H2 formation would be ascribable to photochemical proton reduction to generate H2 by the TiO2–Pt that has been reported earlier.9 The effect of pH is shown in Table 1.

Since the pKa value for the dissociation of NH4+ to NH3(+H+) is 9.24, the trend of N2 formation on pH should show that the dissociated NH3 is more effective for the photodecomposition than NH4+. However, the trend for H2 formation is not simple; at pH 6.93 the amount H2 formed increased slightly, which should be investigated in more detail in future. The TiO2 powders without deposited Pt did not show any appreciable activity.The photodecomposition yield (%) of NH3 was examined by changing its concentration (1, 0.1 and 0.01 wt%), and the results are shown in Table 2. When the concentration was decreased, the decomposition yield (%) increased (85.4% for 0.01 wt% NH3 after 20 h). After prolonged irradiation this value approached nearly 100% decomposition.

				(P-25, received from Japan Aerosil Co.Ltd.) and acetylacetone (0.4 ml) were mixed well in a mortar while adding 4 ml water slowly during 2 h. Triton X-100 (0.2 ml) was added and further mixed well with the TiO2 slurry, and then the mixture was sonicated. This mixture was spin-coated (2000 rpm) on a FTO glass (2 cm × 1 cm) for about 10 s to obtain 1 cm × 1 cm area of a nanoporous TiO2 film, and the film was dried at 100 °C for 30 min. This procedure was repeated until the film thickness reached 10 µm, and then the film was calcinated at 450 °C for 30 min. The quality of the TiO2 nanoporous film was proved by using this film for a dye-sensitized solar cell10 by using the well-known cis-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(4,4′-dicarboxyl-2,2′-bipyridine)- ruthenium(II), Ru(dcbpy)2(NCS)2
				(called N3) dye with a conventional I3−/I− redox electrolyte solution giving the light-to-electrical power conversion efficiency of around 7%.11A cyclic voltammogram was measured with this TiO2 film as working electrode, Ag–AgCl as a reference electrode, and a platinum foil as a counter electrode in a pH 14.1 aqueous solution of 10 M NH3 containing 0.1 M KNO3 electrolyte. The CVs under dark and under illumination in an Ar atmosphere are shown in Fig. 1. Clear photoanodic currents were observed showing that the TiO2 works as a photoanode in the presence of NH3. This system induced photoanodic currents also in the absence of NH3 under the same pH conditions, but the photocurrent density was less than 1/40 in comparison with the Fig. 1 showing evidently that NH3 works as a donor for the photoelectrochemical event.

Although the photocurrents in Fig. 1 tended to decrease with repeated scanning, it approached a saturated value of around 0.5 mA cm−2 after 3 to 4 hours. The generated H2 and N2 after repeated scanning for 2 hours are shown in Table 3.

The smaller amount of H2 than the 3∶1 ratio could be ascribable to the consumption of the photogenerated electrons by the leaked O2 from air since for this three electrodes system the cell was not tight enough against air leakage. This was supported by the remarkable smaller H2/N2 ratio (0.6) obtained under O2 atmosphere as shown in Table 3. The use of K2SO4 instead of KNO3 as an electrolyte gave almost the same results as Table 3, indicating that NO3− anion is not involved in the photoelectrochemical reaction. By using the nanoporous TiO2 film electrode and a Pt foil counter electrode, photoelectrochemical reaction was carried out (10 M NH3 at pH 14.1 and 0.1 M KNO3) under short circuit conditions without any bias potential. For this system the cell was tight enough against air leakage as the cell used for the TiO2–Pt suspension systems. This system produced 150 µA cm−2 photocurrent, and the H2 and N 2 produced in 2 h were 194 µl and 63 µl, respectively, with the H2/N2 ratio of 3.08/1 nearly in the theoretical 3/1 ratio. The use of a TiO2 nanoporous film with deposited Pt did not show activity for the NH3 photodecomposition. These results show that irradiation of the TiO2 film by UVlight created electrons and holes, the ammonia is oxidized by the holes to N2 and protons, and then the electrons in the conduction band of the TiO2 moved to the counter Pt electrode to reduce protons to H2.Ammonia was thus photochemically decomposed into H2 and N2 by using TiO2–Pt in an aqueous solution, and this photocatalytic system was successfully applied to fabricate a photofuel cell, a new concept of fuel cell, by which NH3 is used as a fuel assisted by photocatalysis to generate photocurrent as well as H2 and N2. The present photolysis of ammonia would not only lead to a future artificial solar nitrogen cycle, but also could lead to a future photofuel cell energy system using ammonia as an energy transporting and storing material.Notes and referencesA.
