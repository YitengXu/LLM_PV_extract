    , Accepted 10th November 2014First published on 11th November 2014AbstractWe report a systematic study of organic photovoltaic cells using novel spiro-acetalized and (thio)acetalized [60]fullerene monoadducts bearing five- to seven-membered rings. One of these compounds had power-conversion efficiencies of 5.8% with PTB7 and 4.0% with poly(3-hexylthiophene); the latter is comparable to that of the commonly used [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester. We investigated the precise factor that governs the device performance by examining the solubility, space-charge-limited current mobility balance of holes and electrons, morphology, and dark current. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction highlighted the key role of compact and flexible spiro ring folding in the rim space in fullerene packing.
Introduction
The global demands for clean energy production have led to renewable sources being extensively explored. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted considerable attention as cost-effective alternatives to the currently dominant counterparts based on inorganic silicon and its compounds.1 The bulk heterojunction (BHJ) is the pivotal architecture in scalable solution processes;2 the prototype is regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as the electron acceptor.3 Although the maximized power-conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of P3HT:PCBM (ca. 4–5%)4 have been surpassed in single cells by low bandgap polymers (LBPs; 7–10%),5 P3HT:fullerene is still important in tandem cells as a complementary photoactive layer that absorbs UV and visible light.6
In the development of high-performing fullerene derivatives for P3HT-based OPVs, raising the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level is a general strategy for improving open-circuit voltages (Voc).7 In this regard, two design approaches have been widely used. One is the introduction of an electron-donating moiety as a solubilizing substituent, but not directly on C60. Examples include the replacement of the PCBM phenyl by alkylthienyl, which gives a PCE of 4.3%, with a moderate increase in Voc (0.64 V)8 compared with P3HT:PCBM (0.58 V). The other, more effective, approach is decreasing the π-conjugated system of fullerene (60π, 58π, 56π) by multi-addition of substituents, leading to incremental drops in the electron affinity via symmetry breaks. Notably, successful 56π multi-adduct fullerenes are C60 bis-adducts of indene (ICBA, PCE = 4.7–6.5%)9 and (thieno)-o-quinodimethane (PCE = 5.1–5.3%);10 these have significantly high Voc (0.84–0.86 V) without significant decreases in the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF).
Despite numerous reports on 58π fullerenes, such as monoadducts and 1,4-adducts, PCBM has played a central role for the past two decades2 because of its high PCE and compatibility with a large number of LBPs.5 Indeed, 58π fullerenes, which have PCEs comparable to that of P3HT:PCBM, are limited to PCBM-modified ones (4.0–4.3%),8 and indene or quinodimethane monoadducts (3.6–4.2%).9a,11 A majority of other 58π fullerenes have low PCEs in combination with P3HT.7,12 A subtle chemical alteration, e.g., replacing the methyl of PCBM by a long-chain alkyl, has a strong negative impact on the PCE, although there is no effect on the electrochemical properties.12a This is because of the difficulty in simultaneously achieving solubility, polymer miscibility, and electron-accepting and -transporting abilities. The presence of bulky and flexible substituents improves the solubility; however, steric hindrance inhibits tight packing of fullerenes, which is preferable for electron transport, leading to decreases in Jsc and FF.
In this study, we focused on novel spiro-acetalized and (thio)acetalized [60]fullerene monoadducts bearing five-, six-, and seven-membered rings (SAFn and STAFn, n = 5–7, Scheme 1). The underlying concept of these 58π C60 monoadducts is that the flexibility of the acetal units ensures solubility, and their compact structures allow folding into the rim space of fullerene aggregates in the film state; these effects are important for both charge separation and transport. The electrochemical, morphological, crystallographic, and electrical properties were thoroughly investigated. The PCEs of P3HT:fullerenes were found to scale roughly with the fullerene solubility; SAF7 demonstrated the highest PCE, i.e., 4.0%, comparable to that of PCBM (4.1%). More importantly, we showed that the balance of hole and electron mobilities is the precise factor governing the overall PCE.

Results and discussion
Electrochemical and OPV characterizations

SAFn and STAFn were synthesized using a previously reported facile two-step reaction.13 The non-cyclic compound SAF was also prepared as a reference. The Diels–Alder reaction of C60 with a silyl ether diene, followed by acid treatment, afforded the precursor 1, which was subsequently subjected to nucleophilic attack by diols or thiols on a carbonyl group of 1, in the presence of a TiCl4 catalyst; yields were 75–95% (Scheme 1). The products were analyzed using 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies (ESI, Fig. S1–S3†), HPLC analysis (Fig. S4,† purity > 98–99.5%), and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry. The LUMO energies of (thio)acetalized fullerenes and PCBM were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV), using an Ag/AgCl electrode and Pt as the working and counter electrode in o-dichlorobenzene (DCB) (Tables 1, S1 and Fig. S5†). All the compounds exhibited three reversible one-electron-reduction waves, and showed LUMOs approximately 0.02–0.05 eV higher than that of PCBM (−3.63 eV), as a result of the electron-donating abilities of the alkoxy14 and thioalkoxy substituents. Their solubilities in toluene were considerably lower (0.1–0.6 wt%) than that of PCBM (1.0 wt%), but most of them were suitable for device fabrication using DCB as the solvent.

The OPV performances of P3HT:fullerenes (1:1, wt%) were evaluated in a normal cell structure (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Ca/Al), according to our previous protocol.16 The optimal blend ratio was examined for P3HT:SAF7, indicating that 1:1 is superior to 1:0.8 and 1:1.2 (Table S2 and Fig. S6†). The active layers (thickness 200 nm) were prepared by spin-coating of DCB solutions, followed by solvent annealing in a covered petri dish. Fig. 1a shows the current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of representative P3HT:fullerene devices under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (Table 2). It should be emphasized that SAF7 exhibited the best PCE, i.e., 4.04% (average: 3.95%), comparable to that of PCBM (4.07%, average: 4.01%). This results from the high Voc of 0.65 V, without sacrificing Jsc (9.09 mA cm−2) and FF (0.69), compared with that of PCBM (Voc = 0.58 V, Jsc = 10.10 mA cm−2, FF = 0.69). The difference between the Vocs of SAF7 and PCBM (ΔVoc = 0.07 V) is consistent with the slight lift of the LUMO (0.03 eV) of the former, measured by CV; the observed ΔVoc was almost twice the LUMO difference (vide infra). STAF6 had the second-highest PCE, i.e., 3.81% (average: 3.65%) with a 6% higher Jsc of 9.66 mA cm−2 and a lower FF (0.67) and Voc (0.59 V) than SAF7. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were similar, and only the intensities differed. The differences among the optical absorptions of (thio)acetalized fullerenes are therefore mostly negligible. It is also worth noting that noncyclic SAF showed no diode characteristics, although it has the same number of carbon as the high-performing SAF7, underscoring the critical role of the cyclic acetal unit.

The tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) phase images indicate that the morphologies associated with miscibility with P3HT did not differ much (Fig. 2). However, the device outputs varied significantly; for instance, the keto precursor 1 had a PCE of 2.6%, although its solubility and film morphology were the same as those of the highest-performing compound, SAF7. The surface roughness, evaluated from the topological images, did not correlate with the device PCE (Fig. S7†). The five-ring SAF5 and STAF5 displayed the lowest solubilities, less than 0.2 wt%, and consequently had poor PCEs (0.90% and 0.009%, respectively); micrometer-scale aggregates were observed even with an optical microscope (Fig. S8†). The low solubilities of five-ring entities are presumably attributable to their restricted conformations, which cannot provide enough interactions with the solvent. A flexible twisted-boat conformation becomes possible for six- and seven-membered moieties, analogous to cyclohexane. The behaviors of the acetalized SAFn compounds are consistent with this explanation (ring rigidity), because their PCEs increased with increasing ring size. In contrast, the PCE of (thio)acetalized STAF7 is lower compared to STAF6, suggesting that the ring size effect is not simple.

Solubility and mobility balance
The PCE plot against solubility showed a linear correlation for solubilities in toluene of less than 0.6 wt%. This indicates that solubility, which is related to the BHJ morphology, is a rough indicator of the PCE (Fig. 3a). However, the correlation suddenly changed at 0.6 wt%, and the PCE became constant up to 1.0 wt% of PCBM. Solubility is a basic requirement for solution processes,12a but the consequent device output is largely affected by other parameters. One of them is polarity, which is associated with the surface energies (SE) of the components.17 The SE values of spiro-(thio)acetalized fullerenes, PCBM, and P3HT were evaluated for each pristine film by measuring the contact angles (Table S3 and Fig. S9†). Fig. 3b shows the relationship between PCE and SE. Except for SAF5 (SE = 58 mJ m−2, partly because of the lotus effect of its rough surface), the SEs of all the fullerenes were in the range 25–37 mJ m−2, which is almost identical to that of 35 mJ m−2 for PCBM. Therefore, the SE is ruled out as a determinant of device performance.

The effects of the charge-carrier mobilities of P3HT:fullerene blend films were investigated using space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements.18 To separately evaluate the hole and electron mobilities of the devices with moderate and high PCEs (SAF5,6,7, STAF6,7, and PCBM), ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and Al/active layer/LiF/Al devices were fabricated as hole-only and electron-only devices, respectively (Fig. S10†). The data in Table 3 show that the hole mobilities (μh) are constrained within a factor of fourteen (1.1 × 10−4 to 1.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), whereas six orders of magnitude differences (10−9 to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) were found for the electron mobilities (μe). Fig. 4a and b present the semi-logarithmic plots of PCE vs. μh and μe, respectively; a good correlation is seen for μe but not for μh. Moreover, the plot of PCE against the mobility balance (μe/μh) further improved the correlation, highlighting that μe/μh is the precise factor governing the overall PCE (Fig. 4c). The impact of the mobility balance has been previously investigated by simulation19 and processing;20 the PCE maximized at μe/μh is slightly higher than unity in a normal cell, because of the inhomogeneous depth profile.19 Unbalanced mobility leads to space charge buildup and recombination, resulting in deterioration in the Jsc and FF. Our results for P3HT:PCBM (μe/μh = 3.1, PCE = 4.1%) are consistent with the simulation results,19 and a well-balanced μe/μh of 1.2 was obtained for P3HT:SAF7, resulting in the best PCE, i.e., 4.0%, among the (thio)acetalized fullerenes.

Crystallography and dark current analysis
Crystallographic information provides insights into the packing nature of (thio)acetalized fullerenes. A single crystal of STAF7 with toluene intercalated at a 1:1 stoichiometry was obtained by slow evaporation of toluene solution and subjected to single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The other fullerenes yielded only fine powders, which were unsuitable for single-crystal XRD. As shown in Fig. 5, a pair of STAF7 molecules are arranged in a double helical structure along all the axes (P212121), with inter-fullerene distances of 3.19 and 3.22 Å for the c and b axes, respectively.21 The shortest fullerene center-to-center distance is 10.07 Å, which is comparable to those for PCBM (9.85 Å) and C60 (10.0 Å) crystals.22 The spiro seven-membered ring fills the rim space in the fullerene packing. This is an intuitive representation of the self-assembling nature of (thio)acetalized fullerenes and their consequent good electron-transport properties.

In addition to their retained electron-transport abilities, the excellent Vocs of 58π fullerenes (0.65 V) are worth mentioning. These are partly explained by the electron-donating effect of methoxy units at the spiro position. For instance, the LUMO of PCBM can be moderately raised by 0.085 eV by substituting methoxyl at the phenyl ring.14 P3HT:SIMEF (1,4-adduct, 58π) also has a Voc of 0.65 V,12d the same as that of our P3HT:SAF7. However, no clear correlation was found in the LUMO vs. Voc plot (Fig. 6a). We therefore performed dark current analysis of BHJ blend films at low temperature, using the Shockley diode equation (experimental and analytical fits of J–V curves are provided in Fig. S11†).23 This analysis separates the Arrhenius-type dark current, J0 = J00exp(–EA/kBT), into contributions from the pre-exponential factor (J00) and activation energy (EA), both of which independently affect Voc.23a As shown in Fig. 6b and c, the large difference in EA, rather than in J00, reasonably accounts for the Voc difference, suggesting that the formation of a charge-transfer (CT) state at the donor–acceptor interface is reduced by the effect of the partly bulky spiro-acetalized unit, as has been discussed for PCBM and ICBA.23a Spiro-(thio)acetalized fullerenes are more likely to interact with P3HT than are spiro-acetalized ones, forming a weak interfacial CT state and decreasing the EA. Therefore, the spiro-acetalized motif is advantageous not only for accommodating both solubility and compact packing, but also for controlling the preferred donor–acceptor interface in the BHJ framework.

The noteworthy feature of PCBM is its wide applicability to LBPs.2–5 In contrast, ICBA, which gives an excellent OPV output in combination with P3HT, does not work well when blended with LBPs, except with the crystalline polymer PSEHTT,24 and the ternary blend LBP:PCBM:ICBA;25 this again shows the complexity in developing efficient fullerene derivatives. The high-performance benchmark LBP, PTB7:PCBM, gave a PCE of 7.4% in our inverted cell (ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag, Table 1 and Fig. S12†), using chlorobenzene (CB) with 3 vol% of a solvent additive (1,8-diiodooctane, DIO), whereas PTB7:ICBA has been reported to show a significant decrease, down to 4.8%.25 However, our PTB7:SAF7 maintained a good PCE of 5.8% when processed using CB with 3 vol% DIO (Tables 1, S4, and Fig. S13†). Although these processing conditions have not been fully screened, the present results indicate extra scope for creating efficient fullerenes suitable for LBPs. Another approach for the development of spiro-(thio)acetalized fullerenes is the synthesis of multi-adducts with identical or heterogeneous units. For instance, the Vocs of bis- and tris-adducts of PCBM (bisPCBM:56π and trisPCBM:54π) increase to 0.73 and 0.81 V, respectively; the overall PCE was maximized for bisPCBM (4.2%), but significantly decreased for trisPCBM.26 The most sterically compact adduct is 1,2-dihydromethano (CH2) fullerene, which is developed by Matsuo et al.,27a and this guarantees high electron mobility, a raised LUMO, and high environmental stability. Hetero bis-addition of CH2 and quinodimethane or indene to C70, e.g., C70(CH2)(indene) and further improved the PCE to 6.4%.27b,c These designs are worth exploring to facilitate the development of fullerene-based BHJ architectures.
Conclusion
We designed and synthesized novel spiro-(thio)acetalized [60]fullerene monoadducts containing five- to seven-membered rings, using a facile and high-yield two-step reaction. P3HT:SAF7 had a PCE of 4.0%, comparable to that of P3HT:PCBM (4.1%), together with a high Voc (0.65 V), ascribed to the high EA. The PCEs were found to roughly correlate with the solubility of fullerene and precisely with the balance of SCLC mobilities in the blends (μe/μh = 0.01–1.2). Single-crystal XRD of STAF7 (PCE = 3.4%) showed a double-helical structure with a shortest distance of 3.19 Å, in which the flexible and large (thio)acetalized rings, which benefit solubility, are folded into the rim space of fullerene packing. In addition to obtain a good PCE of 5.8% for PTB7:SAF7, our study offers plenty of study for pursuing high-efficiency fullerene-based OPVs, simply based on a general property, i.e., solubility, and a specific one, namely mobility balance.
