    , Accepted 28th September 2012First published on 1st October 2012AbstractWe report highly efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs) with rhodamine 101, a conjugated zwitterion with positive and negative charges on the same molecule, as the electron-collection interlayer. Rhodamine 101 can be processed by solution processing techniques or thermal deposition. The rhodamine 101 interlayer simultaneously improves the short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, fill factor so as to improve the photovoltaic efficiency of the PSCs with poly[[9-(1-octylnonyl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl-2,5-thiophenediyl] (PCDTBT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the active materials in comparison with control PSCs with Al or Ca/Al as the cathode. The photovoltaic efficiency reaches 6.15% for the PSCs with rhodamine 101/Al as the cathode under AM1.5G illumination, whereas the efficiencies are only 3.81% and 4.57% for the control PSCs with Al and Ca/Al as the cathodes, respectively. On the other hand, the improvement on the photovoltaic performance by the rhodamine 101 interlayer is less remarkable for the PSCs with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or PC71BM as the active materials. The photovoltaic efficiency is 4.25% for the PSCs with rhodamine 101/Al as the cathode, almost the same as that (4.20%) of the control PSCs with Ca/Al as the cathode. The high efficiency of the PSCs with the rhodamine 101 interlayer is ascribed to the lowering of the work function of metals by rhodamine 101 that has a strong dipole moment. The different effects of the rhodamine 101 interlayer on the two PSCs with PCDTBT and P3HT as the donor materials are attributed to different reactivities of the two polymers with active metals like Ca and Al. PCDTBT consisting of both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing units is more reactive with the active metals. The reaction between PCDTBT and Ca leads to low photovoltaic efficiency of the PSCs with Ca/Al as the cathode.
1. Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been regarded as the next-generation solar cells due to the low fabrication cost and high mechanical flexibility.1–5 A high power conversion efficiency (PCE) is always required for solar cells. The PCE of PSCs can be improved by optimizing the morphology of the active layer,6–10 increasing the light absorption,11,12 and synthesizing novel donor and acceptor materials.3,5,13–23 The PCE also strongly depends on the interfaces between the active layer and the two electrodes. Proper energy alignment at the active layer/electrode interfaces is needed for the charge collection and the prevention of the charge recombination at the interfaces. However, most of the popular electrode materials, such as indium tin oxide (ITO) and stable metals, do not possess the desirable surface properties. This problem can be solved by putting an interlayer between the active layer and the cathode or anode. Various materials have been reported as the interlayer for electron collection, including inorganic and organic materials. The inorganic materials include TiOx, ZnO, LiF, Al2O3, PbO, Cs2CO3 and sodium compounds,24–34 and the organic materials include fullerene derivatives, titanium complexes, bathocuproine, copper phthalocyanine, bathophenanthroline, 1,3,5-tri(N-phenylbenzimidazol-2-yl)benzene, polar polymers and polyelectrolytes.35–54 These materials can be classified in terms of their effect on the work function of ITO or metals. TiOx and ZnO can be used for the electron collection, because they are semi-conductors with low work function. Other materials can lower the work function by forming or inducing a dipole layer on the surface of ITO or metals. Alcohol-soluble polyelectrolytes have been gaining particular attention as the electron-collection interlayer.43–54 They can form a thin film on the active layer by solution processing techniques. They can not only help the electron collection but also prevent the charge recombination on the top metal electrode surface by blocking excitons and holes from entering the top metal electrode, so that they can saliently improve the photovoltaic efficiency of PSCs. This effect is ascribed to the strong dipole moment mainly originating from the positive and negative charges of the polyelectrolytes. For example, Cao et al. reported high-performance PSCs with an alcohol-soluble conjugated polyelectrolytes as the electron-collection interlayer.50 These conjugated polyelectrolytes can simultaneously improve the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of PSCs with low-bandgap polymers, such as poly[[9-(1-octylnonyl)-9H-carbazole-2,7-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl-2,5-thiophenediyl] (PCDTBT) and poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7), as the donor materials. But one concern about polyelectrolytes is the presence of small counterions, which can diffuse under electric field and deteriorate the performance of PSCs.55,56 Zwitterions and polyzwitterions have also been used as the interfacial materials for the organic optoelectronic devices, particularly for polymer light-emitting diodes.57–60
In this paper, we report the application of rhodamine 101 as the electron-collection interlayer material between the active layer and the top metal electrode of PSCs. Rhodamine 101 is used because it is a conjugated zwitterion with both positive and negative charges at different locations of the same molecule (Scheme 1(a)). It has a strong dipole moment, whereas it does not diffuse under electric field. The interlayer can be prepared by spin coating of alcohol solution of rhodamine 101 or thermal deposition. The rhodamine 101 interlayer simultaneously improves Voc, Jsc and FF of the PSCs with PCDTBT (chemical structure shown in Scheme 1(a)) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the active materials in comparison with the control PSCs with Al and Ca/Al as the cathodes. But it has a different effect on the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and PCBM [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) (or PC71BM) as the active materials.

2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and device fabrication
Regioregular P3HT (Model no. 4002-EE) and PCDTBT were purchased from Rieke Metals and 1-Material, respectively. PC61BM and PC71BM were supplied by Nano-C and American Dye Source, respectively. All other chemicals, including rhodamine 101, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. All materials were used as received.

Scheme 1(b) illustrates the architecture of a PSC with a layer of rhodamine 101 as the cathode interlayer. The PSCs were fabricated by the following process. Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass sheets were sequentially cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol (IPA). Each rinsing step was carried out in a Brason 50 ultrasonic bath for 15 min. They were subsequently dried under nitrogen flow. After they were treated in a Jelight UV–ozone cleaner for 15 min, a thin layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was formed by spin coating a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Clevios 4083 by Heraeus) at 5000 rpm for 1 min. The PEDOT:PSS layer was dried at 140 °C for 10 min. The ITO sheets coated with PEDOT:PSS were then transferred into a glove box filled with dried nitrogen gas to coat the active layer. For PCDTBT:PC71BM PSCs, the active layer was prepared by coating a solution consisting of 7 mg mL−1 PCDTBT and 28 mg mL−1 PC71BM in co-solvent of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and o-dichlorobenzene (oDCB) (volume ratio = 13:87) at 900 rpm for 60 s. The PCDTBT:PC71BM active layer was dried at 70 °C for 10 min and had a thickness of 70 nm. For P3HT:PC61BM PSCs, the active layer was formed by spin coating an oDCB solution consisting of 20 mg mL−1 P3HT and 20 mg mL−1 PC61BM at 500 rpm for 60 s. The P3HT:PC61BM film was dried in a covered Petri-dish at room temperature for 30 min and had a thickness of 200 nm. Then, a thin layer of rhodamine 101 was prepared on the active layer by solution processing or vacuum deposition. Rhodamine 101 solution in IPA was spin coated on the active layer at 2000 rpm for the solution processing. For vacuum deposition, rhodamine 101 was thermally deposited at 0.1 Å s−1 in a chamber of 10−7 mbar. The PSCs were completed by thermally depositing a 200 nm thick metal layer at a rate of 1–2 Å s−1. A couple of metals including Al, Au, Ag and Cu were investigated as the top metal electrode. The PSCs were then transferred into the glove box and were encapsulated with UV-curable epoxy and glass sheets. The PSCs were taken out for the photovoltaic tests in air. The active area of each PSC was 0.11 cm2.
2.2 Material and device characterizations
The current density (J)–voltage (V) curves of PSCs were measured with a computer-programmed Keithley 2420 source/meter and a Newport's Oriel class A solar simulator, which simulated the AM1.5G sunlight (100 mW cm−2) and certified to the JIS C 8912 standard. The light source was also calibrated with a standard silicon photodiode (Hammamatsu S1133). Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) were measured with a 300 W Xenon Lamp (Oriel 6258) as the light source and a Cornerstone 260 Oriel 74125 monochromator with a resolution of 10 nm. The light intensity was calibrated with a NREL-recommended Si detector (Oriel 71030NS), and the short-circuit currents were determined with an Oriel 70310 optical power meter.
Atomic force microscopic (AFM) images were acquired using a Veeco NanoScope IV Multi-Mode AFM system with the tapping mode. Surface potential images were collected with a MFP-3D atomic force microscope by Asylum Research with the Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM) tapping mode. A Pt-coated cantilever tip (tip radius 15 nm) with a spring constant of 2 N m−1 and a resonant frequency of ∼70 kHz (Electric-Lever, Olympus, Japan) were used for the measurements. All the KPFM measurements were performed at a 3 V AC voltage and a lift height of 40 nm under ambient conditions. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were acquired with a VG ESCA 220i-XL Imaging XPS. The AC impedance study was carried out using an AutoLab Electrochemical Station in the dark. The AC amplitude is 25 mV. Frequencies of 10 and 50 Hz were used for PCDTBT:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM PSCs, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted in a 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution with an AutoLab Electrochemical Station. A Pt disk, a Pt wire, and a Ag/Ag+ electrode were used as the working electrode, the counter electrode, and the reference electrode, respectively. The scan rate was 50 mV s−1.
The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of P3HT and PCDTBT are calculated by the DFT simulations using the Gaussian03 program.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Photovoltaic performances of PSCs with rhodamine 101 as the electron-collection interlayer
PCDTBT, whose chemical structure is shown in Scheme 1(a), as a polymer donor material has been gaining strong attention due to its low bandgap, low-lying HOMO, and good stability.61–63 The electron-withdrawing unit, benzothiadiazole, gives rise to a low-lying HOMO of PCDTBT, so that the Voc of PSCs with PCDTBT as the donor material is remarkably higher than that with P3HT as the donor material. Rhodamine 101, whose chemical structure is also shown in Scheme 1(a), was investigated as the interlayer between the PCDTBT:PC71BM layer and Al. Rhodamine 101 can be processed by solution processing techniques because it is soluble in polar organic solvents like alcohol, and it can also be deposited by thermal deposition as a small organic molecule.

Fig. 1(a) shows the J–V curve of a PCDTBT:PC71BM PSC with rhodamine 101 as the interlayer between the active layer and Al. The rhodamine 101 layer was deposited by spin coating a 0.05 wt% rhodamine 101 solution in IPA at 2000 rpm. The film thickness is about 1 nm as estimated from optical absorption. The J–V curves of two control PSCs with Al and Ca/Al as the cathodes without the rhodamine 101 interlayer are also presented. The photovoltaic parameters, including Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE, of these PSCs are summarized in Table 1. The PSC with a rhodamine 101 interlayer exhibits high photovoltaic performances: Jsc = 11.10 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.94 V, FF = 0.59, and PCE = 6.15%. Compared with the PSC with Al cathode, all three photovoltaic parameters are improved substantially, i.e. 15% enhancement in Voc (0.82 vs. 0.94 V), 10% enhancement in Jsc (10.08 vs. 11.10 mA cm−2) and 28% enhancement in FF (0.46 vs. 0.59). This leads to an overall enhancement in PCE by 61% (from 3.81% to 6.15%). The improvement in the photovoltaic performance of PCDTBT:PC71BM PSCs by rhodamine 101 is similar to that by polyelectrolytes.50

The photovoltaic performance of the PSC with the rhodamine 101 layer is also saliently higher than that of the control PSC with Ca/Al as the cathode. All the Voc (0.89 V), Jsc (9.50 mA cm−2) and FF (0.54) values of this control PSC are lower than those of the PSC with the rhodamine 101 interlayer. Hence, the rhodamine 101 interlayer can help efficiently collect electrons from the PCDTBT:PC71BM active layer.
The improvement in the photovoltaic performance of PSCs by the rhodamine 101 interlayer can be understood in terms of its effect on the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh). The Rs and Rsh values of the PSCs were estimated according to the slopes of the J–V curves at 1.5 V and 0 V in the dark, respectively (Table 1). The Rs value of the PSC with rhodamine 101/Al as the cathode is saliently lower than that of PSCs with Ca/Al or Al as the cathode. In other words, rhodamine 101 can give rise to Ohmic contact between the active layer and Al. The rhodamine 101 interlayer also has a remarkable effect on Rsh of PSCs. The PSC with the rhodamine 101 interlayer exhibits a Rsh value that is two orders higher than that of the control PSC with Ca/Al as the cathode and one order higher than that of PSC with Al as the cathode. It suggests that the rhodamine 101 interlayer can greatly suppress leakage current in the PSC. These Rs and Rsh values are consistent with the photovoltaic performances of the PSCs with different cathodes. It is worth noting that the PSC with the Ca/Al electrode has the smallest Rsh among the three cells. Probably, Ca can react with PCDTBT during the thermal deposition of Ca. This is further discussed later.
The effect of rhodamine 101 on Jsc of the PSCs is confirmed by the IPCE measurements. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the PSC with the rhodamine 101/Al electrode has the highest IPCE in the wavelength range from 300 nm to 800 nm. The Jsc values by integrating the IPCE spectra are 10.29, 9.72 and 10.93 mA cm−2 for PSCs with Al, Ca/Al and rhodamine 101/Al as the cathodes, respectively. They are consistent with the Jsc values according to the J–V curves of these devices.
The rhodamine 101 interlayer can also be formed by thermal deposition. The PCDTBT:PC71BM PSCs with the rhodamine 101 interlayer prepared by thermal deposition have the photovoltaic performance almost the same as that with the rhodamine 101 layer by solution processing.
Stable metals, Au, Ag and Cu, were used to replace Al as the top metal electrode on the rhodamine 101 interlayer. The J–V curves of these PSCs are presented in Fig. 2. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. All the three PSCs exhibit high photovoltaic performance with the PCE values >5.2%. Though these metals have work functions higher than Al, they do not affect the Voc value. But they slightly affect Jsc and FF. This suggests that the performance improvement is due to the interface modification by the rhodamine 101 layer and the top metal electrode only serves as an electron conductor. The Jsc for PSCs with Cu and Au electrodes are slightly lower than PSCs with Al and Ag as the top electrodes. This is probably related to the lower reflectivity of Cu and Au. For example, the reflectance of Ag, Cu and Au measured at 480 nm is 97, 43 and 41%, respectively.64 Control PSCs without rhodamine 101 were also fabricated (Fig. 2 and Table 2). Their efficiencies are remarkably lower than the corresponding PSCs with the rhodamine 101 interlayer, because the rhodamine 101 interlayer simultaneously improves the Voc, Jsc and FF values.

The photovoltaic performance is dependent on the thickness of the rhodamine 101 interlayer. The thickness of the rhodamine 101 interlayer can be precisely controlled by the thermal deposition of rhodamine 101. Fig. 3 presents the variations of Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE with the interlayer thickness for the PCDTBT:PC71BM PSCs. When the interlayer thickness increases from 1 to 6 Å, Voc hardly changes, whereas Jsc and FF at first increase and then decrease. The optimal thickness of the rhodamine 101 interlayer is 3 Å in terms of PCE.

The morphology of the rhodamine 101 layer on the PCDTBT:PC71BM films was investigated by AFM (Fig. 4). The rhodamine 101 layer by solution coating is quite smooth and uniform. But grains can be observed for the rhodamine 101 layers by thermal deposition, which may be related to the crystallization of the molecules. Rhodamine 101 may not cover the whole surface of the active layer when the rhodamine 101 layer is less than 3 Å thick. But a too thick rhodamine 101 layer can increase Rs and lead to the decrease in Jsc and FF of PSCs.

The image size is 2 μm and height bar is 10 nm. 
Rhodamine 101 was also used as the cathode interlayer of P3HT:PC61BM PSCs. Fig. 5(a) presents the J–V curves of PSCs, glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PC61BM/cathode, with Al, Ca/Al and rhodamine 101/Al as the cathodes. The rhodamine 101 layer of 3 Å thick was prepared by thermal deposition. The photovoltaic parameters of the PSCs are summarized in Table 3. The PSC with a rhodamine 101 interlayer exhibits high photovoltaic performance: Jsc = 10.59 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.59 V, FF = 0.68, and PCE = 4.25%. Different from the PCDTBT:PC71BM PSCs, the photovoltaic parameters are comparable to PSCs with Ca/Al as the cathode while much higher than that of the control PSC with Al as the cathode. Different cathode materials do not have a remarkable effect on Jsc of P3HT:PC61BM PSCs. This is also confirmed by the IPCE spectra of the three devices with different cathodes (Fig. 5(b)). The Jsc values calculated in terms of the IPCE spectra are 10.37, 10.04 and 10.50 mA cm−2 for PSCs with Al, Ca/Al and rhodamine 101/Al as the cathodes, respectively. The slightly lower Jsc value for the PSC with Ca/Al than PSCs with the other two cathodes can be attributed to the slight light absorption by Ca as pointed out by Hadipour et al.65

The effect of these cathode materials on Rsh of P3HT:PC61BM PSCs is different from that of PCDTBT:PC71BM PSCs. The former with Al as the cathode exhibit the lowest Rsh, whereas the latter with Ca/Al as the cathode have the lowest Rsh. The different effects of the rhodamine 101 interlayer on the PCDTBT:PC71BM PSCs and P3HT:PC61BM PSCs are not related to the acceptors. We also fabricated P3HT:PC71BM PSCs with Al, Ca/Al and rhodamine 101/Al as the cathodes and observed almost the same photovoltaic performances as those of the corresponding P3HT:PC61BM PSCs.
It was recently reported that treating the active layer with alcohol could improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.66–68 To find out the solvent contribution to the photovoltaic performance of our PSCs with the solution-processed interlayer, control experiments were carried out on both PCDTBT:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM PSCs. IPA was spin coated on top of the active layer before thermal annealing of the active layer and top Al electrode deposition. The photovoltaic performance of these PSCs is presented in the ESI.† The IPA treatment improves Voc from 0.81 to 0.84 V for PCDTBT:PC71BM PSCs and from 0.46 to 0.52 V for P3HT:PC61BM PSCs. PCE increases from 3.67% to 4.38% for PCDTBT:PC71BM PSCs and from 2.53% to 2.73% for P3HT:PC61BM PSCs after the IPA treatment. Therefore, the significant enhancement in PCE of PSCs in this study is mainly due to the rhodamine 101 interlayer.
3.2 Mechanism for the improvement in the photovoltaic performance of PSCs by rhodamine 101
The energy levels, including the HOMO/LUMO levels of PCDTBT, P3HT, PC61BM and PC71BM and work functions of the metals, are shown in Scheme 2. Only the work function of Ca is higher than the LUMO levels of PC61BM and PC71BM. In principle, the PSCs with Ca should have the highest Voc, whereas the Voc values should be lower when other metals are used as the top metal electrode. The high Voc values of the PSCs with the rhodamine 101 interlayer suggest that rhodamine 101 can significantly affect the interface between the active layer and the top metal electrode.
 Scheme 2  Energy diagram of materials. WF: work function. 
In order to understand the effect of rhodamine 101 on the interface between the active layer and Al, PSCs were studied by ac impedance spectroscopy. Analysis of the ac impedance spectra can shed light on the interface between the metal and semiconductor.69–71 For example, when a metal of low work function is in contact with a p-type semiconductor, electrons tend to diffuse from the metal into the semiconductor. Consequently, a depletion zone is formed on the semiconductor and the bands of the semiconductor bend at the vicinity of the contact. The width of the depletion zone is affected by the external bias. The Mott–Schottky model has been also used to analyze the interfaces between the active layer and electrodes of PSCs.72–74 Garcia-Belmonte et al. demonstrated that the capacitances (C) in a range from a low-forward bias to reverse bias are related to the width of the depletion zone and estimated the depletion width (w), impurity concentration (N) that arises from structural inhomogeneities or chemical impurities present in the organic semiconductor and built-in potential (VBI) of PSCs according to the Mott–Schottky model, (1)where q is the elemental charge, εr is the relative permittivity of the organic semiconductor that is around 3,73εo is the vacuum permittivity, and A is the area of the polymer solar cell.

N can be obtained in terms of the slope of the Mott–Schottky plot, (2)
The width w at zero bias can be estimated by (3)

Fig. 6 shows C−2 ∼ V curves of the PSCs, glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCDTBT:PC71BM/cathode and glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT: PC61BM/cathode, with Al and 3 Å thick rhodamine 101/Al as the cathodes. By extrapolating the linear portion of a curve in the low-forward bias range, the interception to x-axis yields VBI of the device according to eqn (1). N and w were estimated according to the formulae (2) and (3). The VBI, N and w values of the devices are listed in Table 4. Voc values are also listed. The presence of the rhodamine 101 interlayer increases both the Voc and VBI values. An almost constant doping concentration N implies that the change in the Fermi level of the p-type semiconductor ΔEF is negligibly small, as ΔEF = kBTln(Nb/Na), where kB is Boltzman's constant, T is temperature, Nb and Na are doping concentrations with and without the rhodamine 101 interlayer, respectively.73 In other words, the change in work function of the p-type semiconductor in the active layer is negligible. VBI is due to the difference in work functions of the metal and semiconductor, qVBI = (Φs − Φc), where Φs and Φc are work functions of the p-type semiconductor and cathode, respectively. Thus, the change in VBI (ΔVBI) by the rhodamine 101 interlayer is mainly contributed by the change in the work function of the cathode. Obviously, the change in the work function of the cathode causes the increase in Voc of PSCs.

The effect of the rhodamine 101 interlayer on the work function of the top metal electrode was further investigated by KPFM. At first, a blank Au film on glass and a Au film deposited with a 3 Å thick rhodamine 101 layer were studied by AFM. Au was selected because of its good stability in air. As shown in Fig. 7, the presence of the rhodamine 101 layer hardly affects the surface morphology of the Au film on glass. But this layer remarkably affects the surface potential (Fig. 8). The rhodamine 101 layer increases the surface potential of the Au film by about 1.13 V. This increase in the surface potential indicates that the vacuum level at the Au electrode bends up by 1.13 eV with respect to the active layer, so that the apparent work function of Au is lowered. As a result, the active layer and Au are in Ohmic contact, and the PSCs with a rhodamine 101 interlayer have a high Voc value.

 Fig. 8  2D surface potential images of (a) a Au film on glass and (b) a Au film deposited with a 3 Å thick rhodamine 101 layer. The Au film and rhodamine 101 layer were deposited by thermal evaporation. The two images have different potential scales. The surface potentials are negative for (a) and positive for (b). 
Presumably, the decrease in the work function of the top metal electrode of PSCs is related to the strong dipole moment in rhodamine that has both positive and negative charges on different locations of the same molecule. The strong dipole moment helps the electron collection by bending the vacuum level of the metal up with respect to the active layer. The mechanism is similar to the decrease of the work function of ITO by zwitterions.75
This is further confirmed by theoretical simulation. The molecular configuration of rhodamine 101 was simulated by the Chem3D Ultra program. The distance between positive and negative charges in the same molecule is 9.47 Å. It can give rise to the change of the work function by 0.96 eV for a monolayer of rhodamine 101. It agrees well with the experimental results.
3.3 Reasons for different effects of rhodamine 101 on the photovoltaic performance of PCDTBT:PCBM and P3HT:PCBM PSCs
Although rhodamine 101 can give rise to high photovoltaic performance for both PCDTBT:PC71BM and P3HT:PC61BM (or PC71BM) solar cells, its effects on the photovoltaic performance of the two PSCs are not exactly the same. PCE of PCDTBT:PC71BM PSCs with rhodamine 101/Al as the cathode is significantly higher than the control PSCs with Ca/Al as the cathode, whereas the photovoltaic performance of P3HT:PC61BM or PC71BM PSCs with rhodamine 101/Al as the cathode is almost the same as the control PSCs with Ca/Al as the cathode. This observation is consistent with the results reported in the literature that a high PCE was observed on PCDTBT:PC71BM PSCs when an interlayer is put between the active film and the top metal electrode.48,50,76,77 Though polyelectrolytes as the cathode interlayer could improve the Voc of PSCs with various low-bandgap polymers, He et al. observed that they hardly affected the Voc value of PSCs with P3HT or poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethylhexyloxy)-p-phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV) as the donor material.45 However, to the best of our knowledge, the mechanism for the different effects of the interlayer on PSCs using different polymers has not been well understood, particularly in terms of the chemical reaction between polymers and active metals.
In order to understand the interaction between the active layer and the top metal electrode, 2 nm thick Al and Ca were thermally deposited on 100 nm thick P3HT and PCDTBT polymer films, respectively. The blank films and polymer films thermally deposited with metals were characterized by XPS at a take-off angle of 60° (Fig. 9). The metals broaden the C1s XPS bands of both P3HT and PCDTBT. The full bandwidth at half maximum (FWHM) is 1.1 eV for the blank P3HT, and it increases to 1.40 eV and 1.45 eV after the deposition of Al and Ca, respectively. In comparison, the FWHM is 1.3 eV for the blank PCDTBT, and it increases to 1.55 eV and 1.75 eV after the deposition of Al and Ca, respectively. Two conclusions can be drawn in terms of these results. Firstly, Ca broadens the C1s band of both polymers more significantly than Al. Secondly, the bandwidth broadening by Ca is more significant for PCDTBT than P3HT. As observed on conducting polymers, the broadening of the XPS band implies the doping of the conjugated polymers.78–80 Ca is more reactive than Al, so that the doping of the polymers caused by Ca is more significant than by Al. The more significant broadening for PCDTBT suggests that PCDTBT is more reactive with active metals than P3HT. It can be attributed to the fact that PCDTBT is a copolymer with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing units whereas P3HT is a homopolymer.

The S2p XPS bands of the two polymers were also investigated to further understand the interactions between Ca and the polymers (Fig. 10). There is no appreciable change for P3HT upon the Ca deposition, but the S2p XPS bands shift to red by 0.2 eV for PCDTBT. Similar red-shift is also observed in the N1s XPS band for PCDTBT after the Ca deposition (Fig. 11). The red-shifts of S2p and N1s bands of PCDTBT suggest the electron transfer from Ca to the benzothiadiazole unit, which is an electron-withdrawing unit, at the interface between Ca and PCDTBT.

 Fig. 11  N1s XPS spectra of N1s of PCDTBT films with and without a Ca layer. The XPS spectra were collected at a take-off angle of 60°. 
The XPS study suggests that the two polymers have different reactivities with active metals. Their activities were investigated by electrochemical CV (Fig. 12). The prominent difference is on the electrochemical reduction. No reduction is observed for P3HT down to the potential of −1.9 V vs. Ag/Ag+, whereas the reduction commences at −1.25 V vs. Ag/Ag+ for PCDTBT. Thus, PCDTBT is more prone to accept electrons than P3HT. Obviously, this is related to the electron-withdrawing unit in PCDTBT, which is absent for P3HT.

DFT calculation was performed to simulate the HOMO and LUMO orbitals of the two polymers. The atomic orbitals of almost all the carbon (2pz) and sulfur (3pz) atoms participate in the HOMO and LUMO for P3HT as shown in Fig. 13. In contrast, the LUMO of PCDTBT is mainly formed by the atomic orbitals of the benzothiadiazole unit. The atomic orbitals of other units contribute little to the LUMO. This simulation also indicates that the electrons transferred from the active metals predominantly perch on the benzothiadiazole unit of PCDTBT. It is consistent with the XPS study.

The electron transfer between an active metal and a conjugated polymer can lead to the doping of the conjugated polymer. The doping can greatly increase the conductivity of the conjugated polymer, so as to lower the Rsh. This can account for the small Rsh value of the PCDTBT:PC71BM PSCs with Ca/Al as the cathode. The rhodamine 101 interlayer can not only lower the work function of the top metal electrode but also prevent the electron transfer from an active metal like Ca to a conjugated polymer. The electron transfer is much more significant for PCDTBT than P3HT, so that the PCDTBT:PC71BM PSCs with the rhodamine 101 interlayer have higher photovoltaic performance than the control PSCs with Ca/Al as the cathode. The electron transfer is not so severe for P3HT. Thus, the PSCs with rhodamine 101/Al as the cathode have almost the same photovoltaic performance as the control PSCs with Ca/Al as the cathode.
4. Conclusions
Rhodamine 101, a conjugated zwitterion, can be used as the electron-collection interlayer for PSCs and gives rise to highly efficient PSCs. It simultaneously improves the Jsc, Voc, FF so as to improve the PCE of the PCDTBT:PC71BM PSCs. But the improvement on the photovoltaic performance by the rhodamine 101 interlayer is less remarkable for the P3HT:PC61BM (or PC71BM) PSCs. The PCE of the P3HT:PC61BM (or PC71BM) PSCs with rhodamine 101/Al as the cathode is almost the same as that of the control PSCs with Ca/Al as the cathode. The high efficiency of the PSCs with the rhodamine 101 interlayer is due to the lowering of the work function of metals by rhodamine 101. The different effects of the rhodamine 101 interlayer on the two PSCs with PCDTBT and P3HT as the donor materials are attributed to different reactivities of the two polymers with active metals. This approach provides a unique and effective way to develop highly efficient PSCs.
