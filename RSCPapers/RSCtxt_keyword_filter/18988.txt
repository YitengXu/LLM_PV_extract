Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) pigments have been widely used in inks, paints, and plastics since it was first developed back in the early 1970s. The DPP-based materials were gradually exploited by optical and electrical applications for the excellent fluorescent properties and good charge carrier mobility. In recent years, great interest has been focused on developing organic photovoltaic functional materials containing a DPP core and attractive efficiencies have been achieved. This feature article describes the application of DPP-based materials, highlighting the applications in optoelectrical fields.

Introduction
The increasing energy demands and shortage of fossil fuels has driven people to develop new types of clean and sustainable energy. Today, the dominant photovoltaic (PV) technologies based on crystalline silicon have shown power conversion efficiencies of about 25%1 and commercial products typically achieve module efficiencies of about 15–18%.2 However, there has been a continuous interest in searching for novel types of low-cost solar cells to replace inorganic silicon. Among all the alternative technologies to silicon-based pn-junction solar cells, organic solar cells could lead the way for their low costs, various synthetic methods, sustainability and plastic processing ability.3

Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) pigment shown in Fig. 1 was first discovered by Farnum et al. with the structure of diphenyl-DPP in 19744 and the synthetic pathway was further developed by Iqbal's group in one step in high yield.5 Numerous DPP derivatives have since been synthesized and it rapidly became an important class of high-performance pigments used in inks, paints, and plastics.6 The synthesis and physical properties of DPP pigments have been reviewed.7 Afterward, because of strong fluorescent performance as well as exceptional stability,8DPP has also been investigated for optical-electronic applications such as chemosensors,9 two-photon absorption,10 solid-state dye lasers,11 organic light-emitting diodes,12 organic thin-film transistors13 and so on.

In recent years, the potential of soluble DPP molecules and polymers has been explored with highly promising results in organic solar cells. In this feature article, recent development of organic materials containing DPP applied in bulk-heterojunction solar cells and dye-sensitized solar cells will be described.
Bulk-heterojunction solar cells
Among numerous organic photovoltaic devices, bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have attracted significant attention because of their potential for achieving large area, flexible photovoltaic devices with fast roll-to-roll production and are predicted to yield power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 10% if a suitable low bandgap donor material is discovered.14 The BHJ solar cells typically consist of an active layer, where the donor phase is intimately intermixed with the acceptor phase, and placed between a tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) anode and an Al cathode.15 The dramatic enlargement of the donor–acceptor contact area leads to much easier access of the generated excitons to the donor–acceptor interface as well as their dissociation into holes and electrons and hence improve the power conversion efficiency.
Transformation of solar energy into electricity in BHJ occurs through a series of optical and electronic processes which basically involves: (i) optical absorption of sun light and formation of the exciton; (ii) exciton migration to the donor–acceptor interface; (iii) exciton dissociation into charges (electron and holes), and (iv) charge transport and collection at the electrodes.16
DPP-polymer based BHJ solar cells
A variety of donor and acceptor polymer materials have been used for BHJs as they typically have excellent film-forming characteristics and good film morphology. The highest efficiencies of BHJs have been achieved by mixing electron donor polymers with fullerenes as acceptors.17
(i) 
          DPP-based polymers as the donor material for BHJ photovoltaics
The DPP unit has a well conjugated structure with strong π–π interaction and electron-withdrawing effect, which results in efficient charge transport. The relatively low lying HOMO and LUMO levels also make the DPP unit a promising candidate for application in hybrid solar cells.
One of the DPP-containing polymers (1 shown in Fig. 2) applied in BHJs was reported by the group of Janssen.18 The polymer showed a low optical bandgap of 1.4 eV and obtained a strong tendency to aggregate, resulting in a strong red-shift of the onset of absorption spectra for more than 100 nm. Under optimized conditions using PC70BM, they achieved an efficiency up to 4.0% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.61 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.58, and short circuit current (Jsc) of 11.3 mA cm−2. Following this work, the Janssen group reported a derivative polymer (2) using a 2-hexyldecyl alkyl chain to improve the solubility of the material.19 The material showed a lower bandgap of 1.3 eV and high hole and electron mobilities of 0.04 and 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1. BHJ solar cells were optimized using PC70BM in a 1:2 weight ratio and provided Voc of 0.65 V, Jsc of 11.8 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.60, resulting in an overall conversion efficiency of 4.7%.

Kim and co-workers designed polymer 3 by introducing the electron-rich thienylene vinylene groups as the donor through Pd-catalyzed Stille cross-coupling polymerization.20Polymer 3 obtained a high hole mobility of 0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to the rigid structure, which helps to form efficient intermolecular π–π stacking, therefore increased the carrier mobility. A broad absorption spectra range from 330–900 nm was obtained with a low bandgap value of 1.43 eV. The BHJ solar cell made with blending of the polymer and PC71BM achieved a power conversion efficiency of 1.94% under simulated AM 1.5 G solar irradiation conditions. Ting and co-workers developed a two-dimensional (2D) like conjugated copolymer 4 by connecting conjugated side chains into polythiophene as the donor to broaden the absorption spectra.21 A low bandgap of 1.29 eV was obtained. The power conversion efficiency of 4 was 1.67% with a Jsc of 7.02 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.64 V and FF of 0.37.
Recently, a family of novel semi-random copolymers 5–7 containing poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and differing amounts (5–15%) of the DPP unit were developed by Thompson et al.22 These polymers not only had a broad photocurrent response but also preserved many of the important properties of P3HT. Photovoltaic devices fabricated from 5–7 blended with PC61BM showed higher short-circuit current densities of 9.57–13.87 mA cm−2 compared to P3HT (9.49 mA cm−2), leading to average power conversion efficiencies of 3.6–4.9%, which exceeds the average value of 3.4% for P3HT.
In order to broaden the absorption spectra, different thiophene derivatives with rigid structures were introduced (8–22) (Fig. 3, Table 1). Janssen's group explored copolymers 8–10 containing thieno[3,2-b]thiophene donors with a varying number of interconnecting thiophene units.23 The different number of thiophene units tuned the optical bandgap and the charge transport characteristics of the materials. For photovoltaic applications, the BHJ solar cells based on 8 as the donor and PC60BM as the acceptor achieved power conversion efficiency of 3.4%. Polymers 9 and 10 had a low offset between optical bandgap and the energy of the charge transfer state, thus obtained relatively low efficiency. Li et al. developed copolymer 11 by connecting dihexyl chains to a thieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit.24 With the introduction of the hexyl chains, the polymer was soluble in common organic solvents and possessed a broad absorption band covering 500–900 nm with an optical bandgap of 1.33 eV. The BHJ of the polymer blending with PC70BM demonstrated a PCE of 1.9%.

Patri et al. exploited copolymers 12–14 with electron-rich dialkyl-ProDOTs as the donor.25 The copolymers were found to form excellent films and showed absorption maxima at 670–679 nm with a bandgap of 1.4–1.42 eV. HOMO levels of 5.54–5.51 eV were reported for 12–14. Due to the long chains connected to the ProDOT moiety, the polymers had high conductivity and were stable in iodine doped conditions. However, further investigation to evaluate its potential in photovoltaic devices is needed. In order to increase the effective conjugation length for lower bandgaps, Wei et al. incorporated cyclopenta-dithiophene moieties in polymer 14.26 As a result, polymer 15 exhibited a low bandgap of 1.31 eV and a broad absorption band from 350–1000 nm. The BHJ solar cell blend of 15 and PC70BM was made and reached a high Jsc of 10.87 mA cm−2 and a PCE of 2.27%. Janssen et al. also reported a similar polymer (16) with 15 as a comparison.27Polymer 16 blended with PCBM gave a high FF of 0.70, however the Jsc was rather low with a value of 2.19 mA cm−2 and poor device performance of 0.9%.
Lee and co-workers introduced didecanyldithieno[3,2-b:20,30-d]thiophene (DTT) as the donor (17) and also developed polymer 18 by connecting two thiophene units between DTT and DPP moieties resulting in a red-shifted absorption. At the same time, they also incorporated long, linear alkyl (decanyl) groups in the DTT core and branched alkyl (ethylhexyl) groups in the DPP unit to improve the solubility and processability of the resulting co-polymers. However, the molecular weight of the polymers 17 and 18 were low, 5215 and 5515 g mol−1, leading to low PCEs of 0.29% and 1.39%, respectively.28 Chen et al. synthesized polymer 19 containing a DTT unit with a new strategy of random copolymerization.29 With this new strategy, the molecular weight was improved greatly to 52.4 kg mol−1. Wide absorption spectra from 370–910 nm were obtained. The BHJ solar cells based on polymer 19 with PC71BM showed an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.58 V, a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 12.76 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.67 with a PCE of 5.02%.

Polymer
20 was reported by Yang and co-workers.30 The electron-rich dithienosilole was introduced as the donor to combine with the DPP moiety. Broad absorption spectra of 300–900 nm were obtained. The LUMO energy level of the polymer was relatively high, resulting in a strong electron-donating ability of the material and a relatively high Jsc of 7.5 mA cm−2. However, as the HOMO energy level of the polymer was also high, it led to a low Voc with only 0.55 V. The BHJ solar cell achieved a PCE of 2.1% with the polymer blended with PC70BM. Hashimoto and co-workers developed a new polymer, 21, combining DPP with dithieno[3,2-b:20,30-d]pyrrole, the polymer showed broad absorption in the range of 500–1000 nm in the solutions.31 The BHJs based on this polymer showed a PCE of 1.12%. The monochromatic photocurrent responses extend to the near-infrared region around 1 μm, which makes the material a promising candidate for application in multilayer or tandem photovoltaics, combined with the conventional visible light absorbing materials. Later, they changed the alkyl chain in the DPP segment from 2-ethylhexyl to n-butyl to improve π–π stacking of the polymer backbones.32 The optimized polymer 22 had high hole mobility (0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1) and broad photocurrent response wavelengths from 300 nm to 1.1 μm. The photovoltaic properties of the polymer were also investigated and high short circuit current (14.87 mA cm−2) and PCE (2.71%) were achieved.
With different thiophene and thiophene derivatives connecting to DPP units, the polymers showed broadened absorption spectra and high photocurrents. However, the open-circuit voltage was relatively low. Generally, in BHJs, the Voc is related to the energy difference between the LUMO of the acceptor (PCBM) and the HOMO of the donor (the conjugated polymer). The HOMO level is considered to be decided by the donating ability of the donor part in the conjugated polymer. Janssen et al. introduced a weaker donating phenyl ring adjacent to the thiophene-DPP unit in the main chain (23 shown in Fig. 4) and successfully lowered the HOMO level, resulting in an increased open-circuit voltage.33 Meanwhile, the optical bandgap was also enlarged to prevent reducing the driving force for electron transfer. In combination with PC70BM, power conversion efficiency of 5.5% and high Voc of 0.80 V were obtained under simulated AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) conditions.

Dodabalapur and co-workers reported polymer 24 with a fused naphthalene unit as the donor.34 This polymer also obtained a low HOMO energy level. Meanwhile, due to self-assembled monolayer treatment and thermal annealing, the polymer exhibited a high hole mobility of 0.98 cm2 V−1 s−1. For photovoltaic applications, a PCE of 4.7% was obtained with a Voc of 0.76 V, FF of 0.52 and a short-circuit current of 11.8 mA cm−2. With the introduction of dioctylfluorene as the donor moiety, polymer 25 with a deep HOMO level was developed by Yang's group.30 A high photovoltage of 0.78 V was obtained. However, owing to the high aromaticity of the benzene ring, the absorption spectra of polymer 25 was blue-shifted and the polymer resulted in a low Jsc, the cell achieved a PCE of only 0.78%. Hashimoto and co-workers studied a similar polymer, 26, and found it also showed a deep HOMO energy level.31 The solar cells blended with PCBM showed a Voc of 0.74 V and a low Jsc of 2.51 mA cm−2, resulting in a PCE of 0.88%.
The same properties were found by Janssen's group27 when they designed polymer 27, combining a fluorine moiety and DPP, high Voc and low Jsc were obtained. Ouyang and co-workers introduced ethynyl to connect the fluorine and DPP moiety to broaden the absorption spectra.35 They applied microwave irradiation to shorten the polymerization time and improve molecular weight. The polymers 28 and 29 synthesized under microwave irradiation obtained higher molecular weights of 63 and 89 kg mol−1. The BHJ solar cells showed better Jsc of 4.24 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 0.90 V, resulting in a PCE of 2.25%.
Leclerc et al. exploited a new heterofluorene based on germanium as the donor.36 They studied the properties of polymers 30 and 31 with different alkyl chains and found that the hole mobility of polymer 30 was almost six times higher than that of polymer 31. This was because the shorter alkyl chains of 30 led to better π–π stacking and resulted in a higher hole mobility. The BHJ solar cell based on the two polymers blended with PC70BM showed a PCE of 1.5% with Jsc of 4.1 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.76 V, FF of 0.62 and 1.2% with a Jsc of 2.8 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.76 V and FF of 0.56, respectively.
A series of polymers (32–45) with intermediate donors have also been demonstrated (Fig. 5 and Table 2). Leclerc, Tao and co-workers exploited carbazole as the electron donor combined with DPP to optimize HOMO–LUMO energy levels.37 By incorporating a carbazole unit, polymer 32 showed a deep HOMO energy level and high hole mobility. A PCE of 1.6% for a blend with PC60BM was obtained with a high Voc of 0.85 V. After an optimization of the active layer solvents and donor–acceptor blend ratio with PC70BM, the PCE was improved to 3.2%.38

Heeger et al. optimized the BHJ morphology based on polymers 33 and 34.39 They increased the length of the alkyl side chains and controlled the BHJ phase separation through the addition of processing additives. After using a co-solvent and an interfacial TiOx layer, a better PCE of 3.80% was achieved. Polymer 35 was synthesized by Hashimoto et al. by adding long alkyl chains connected to carbazole units.31 The polymer showed absorption bands in the range of 500–700 nm and a PCE of 2.26% blended with PCBM.
Yuan et al. developed benzo[2,1-b;3,4-b0]dithiophene (BDP)40 consisting of fused dithiophene units with a benzene ring. As a result, polymer 36 blended with PC61BM showed high Voc values of 0.82 V. However, the Jsc was relatively low, resulting in a low PCE of 0.43%. Yang's group also synthesized polymer 37 incorporating BDP with EH-substituted DPP as the acceptor moiety.30 The polymer had a high molecular weight of 47.7 kg mol−1 and a broad absorption band from 300–900 nm. Power conversion efficiency reached a maximum of 4.45% with 37 blended with PC70BM with a Voc of 0.72 V and a Jsc of 10.0 mA cm−2. Patil et al. developed another polymer, 38, with 4,8-dihexyl benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b] dithiophene as the donor.41 The photophysical properties of the polymer showed broad band absorption in the range 620–800 nm with a peak around 656 nm. A PCE of 2.78% was obtained with a high Voc of 0.74 V. By introducing dioctyl to the BDT (39), Yang et al. achieved a similar PCE of 2.53% and a Voc of 0.68 V.30 Li et al. investigated the influence of different substituted alkyl chains on copolymers 40–42.42 It showed that a more branched side chain will promote solubility but at a cost of decreased crystallinity.
Hsu and co-workers developed a new electron-rich unit that can combine the advantages of benzene based fluorene and thiophene based cyclopentadithiophene units to overcome the dilemma between Jsc and Voc.43 Due to the higher thiophene content and more extended conjugated system, polymer 43 exhibited improved optical and electronic properties. The BHJ device incorporating the polymer and PC71BM achieved an impressive PCE of 5.1% with a Jsc of 11.71 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.70 V and FF of 62%.
Ting and co-workers developed polymer 44 with thiophene/phenylene/thiophene (TPT) as the donor.44 They used tetrahexylaryl groups as peripheral substituents of the TPT units to tailor the intermolecular interactions. By incorporating the planar TPT unit, the polymer exerts a broad spectral response in the range from 350–900 nm, with its maximum EQE being approximately 53% and a proper HOMO–LUMO energy level was obtained. The BHJ device based on polymer 44 and PC71BM showed a Jsc of 10.3 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.75 V, FF of 0.54 and a PCE of 4.2%. Wang et al. added long alkyl chains to the DTT unit to improve morphologies and processability.45Polymer 45 exhibited broad absorption properties and had a deep HOMO level. A PCE of 1.76% was obtained with a high open-circuit voltage of 0.88 V.
In general, polymers applied in the BHJs contain the dithiophene-DPP moiety because of its low bandgap and efficient electron transport. In order to further investigate this series of materials, Zhang et al.46 incorporated diphenyl-DPP into polymer 46, shown in Fig. 6 and Table 3, and found that the bandgap was enlarged by means of elevating the LUMO energy level and lowering the HOMO energy level simultaneously. Better hole mobility was obtained compared to the thiophene-DPP. As a result, the BHJ solar cell based on polymer 46 and PC61BM showed a PCE of 0.72% with a Jsc of 3.89 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 0.75 V. They also combined diphenyl-DPP with dialkyoxy substituted benzene through vinyl and ethynylene groups (47–48).47 Bandgaps were enlarged and relatively low HOMO energy levels were obtained. Polymer 47 exhibited both donor and acceptor properties. The polymer 47/PCBM BHJ solar cells exhibited a PCE of 0.16% and the polymer 47/P3HT cell was also fabricated in view of the potential of the polymer as an acceptor, revealing an efficiency of 0.01%.

Patil and co-workers41 also synthesized polymer 49 with dipenyl-DPP as the acceptor and 4,8-dihexyl benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b] as the donor. The photovoltage of the polymer was as high as 0.84 V before annealing due to the deep HOMO level of the polymer. However, due to the lower number of photogenerated excitons and relatively large bandgap of the diphenyl-DPP polymer, the photocurrent was low. As a result, the polymer achieved a PCE of 1.51%. Polymer 50 was developed by Kagan et al. through linking a dodecyl side group to increase the solubility for solution processability.48
For the device fabrication process, they added a small amount (5 wt%) of diiodooctane to the polymer and PCBM mixture solution, resulting in a 38% increase in Jsc, 19% increase of Voc and 53% increase of FF, achieving power conversion efficiency of 1.67%. The polymer also exhibited acceptor properties when paired with P3HT and obtained an efficiency of 0.84%.
Frechet et al. connected a furan moiety to a DPP group and produced polymers 51 and 52.49 High molecular weights of 66 and 29 kg mol−1 were obtained for 51 and 52 while the thiophene polymers only obtained a molecular weight of 2 kg mol−1. Inserting furan moieties into the conjugated polymers improved polymer solubility in common organic solvents, which enables the use of relatively small solubilizing side chains. As a result, the two polymers achieved almost identical PCEs approaching 5.0%. Janssen and co-workers compared the properties of 53 and 2 and found that the PCE of polymer 53 (1.9%) was lower than the thiophene containing polymer 2 (2.7%).50 However, polymer 53, based on furan displayed a better film surface profile and roughness compared to polymer 2 when they had a similar molecular weight, which suggested that for the furan based polymers the performance can be further increased if a higher molecular weight could be obtained.
Recently, Bronstein et al. reported polymers 54 and 55 with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-DPP-based monomer as the acceptor instead of thiophene units.51 The thienothiophene units extended the polymer co-planarity and also promoted a more delocalized HOMO distribution along the backbone, which enhanced intermolecular charge-carrier hopping. Polymer 55 obtained a maximum hole mobility of 1.95 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was the highest mobility from a polymer-based OFET reported to date. As a result, the BHJ solar cells based on 55 gave a high PCE of 5.4%.
(ii) 
          DPP-based materials as acceptors in BHJ solar cells
Some of the DPP-based materials that have been presented have low LUMO energy levels and high electron mobilities in field-effect transistors.52,53 They can also be utilized as the acceptor component in BHJ solar cells by connecting with appropriate substituents.
Janssen and co-workers54 reported three DPP-based polymers (56–58, shown in Fig. 7, Table 4) that act as alternatives to fullerene acceptors. The BHJ solar cells were fabricated based on these polymers as the acceptor and P3HT as the donor. The cells showed high open-circuit voltages of 0.90–0.94 V but low fill factors and short-circuit current densities, limiting the photovoltaic device performance. As a result, these cells achieved an overall power conversion efficiency of 0.14%, 0.11% and 0.36%, respectively. They also prepared DPP-based small molecules 59–60 and applied these materials as acceptors in bulk-heterojunction solar cells with P3HT as the donor.55 It showed that the DPP materials had a clear contribution to the light absorption. However, the fill factors were limited and photocurrents were low, leading to low device efficiencies of 0.31% and 0.29%.

Chen et al. connected trifluoromethylphenyl and trifluorophenyl as end capping groups to the DPP core for application in BHJ solar cells.56 These compounds (61–64) showed optical bandgaps ranging from 1.81–1.94 eV and intense absorption bands that cover a wide range from 300–700 nm. BHJ solar cells using poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the electron donor with these new acceptors were used for fabrication. The best power conversion efficiencies (PCE) using 1:2 donor–acceptor by weight mixture were 1% for polymer 62 under simulated AM 1.5 solar irradiation of 100 mW cm−2.

          DPP modified fullerenes

Fullerenes, particularly C60, have become one of the most promising n-type materials for optoelectronic applications due to its astonishing electronic properties. Different moieties have been connected to C60 to improve its solubility in common organic solvents, tune its energy level and broaden its absorption spectra for better application in BHJ solar cells. As dithiophene-DPP has a relatively low bandgap and good electron transfer, there were several reports about DT-DPP connected C60s for BHJs.

          Morin and co-workers57 reported a new ethynyl-bridged C60 derivative (65) shown in Fig. 8 bearing a dithiophene DPP moiety through an ethynylation reaction. Cyclic voltammetry was performed to study the influence of the DPP moiety on electronic and optical properties of the fullerene. They found that the new compound presented a higher LUMO level than PCBM, which was beneficial for the BHJ solar cells application to improve open-circuit voltage. Ma et al. reported preparation of multifunctional electronic molecules 66–68 by incorporating the DPP core with electron-rich oligothiophene units and electron-withdrawing fullerene units.58 These molecules showed high solubility in common organic solvents, excellent photophysical properties with high extinction coefficients (1 × 104 to 1 × 105 M−1 cm−1) and broad absorption spectra coverage (250–800 nm), as well as suitable molecular orbital energy levels. Best power conversion efficiency of 2.41% was achieved for molecule 68 blending with P3HT.

        DPP in molecular bulk-heterojunctions

        BHJ solar cells have been dominated by polymeric donor materials as they typically have better film-forming characteristics and film morphology than their small-molecule counterparts.59 Despite these advantages, the polymers suffer from synthetic reproducibility and difficult purification procedures, which hinder their commercial viability. Small-molecule materials, however, offer advantages over polymeric materials in terms of ease of synthesis and purification, which greatly improves fabrication reproducibility, as well as possessing a greater tendency to self-assemble into ordered domains, which leads to high charge carrier mobilities.60 These properties make small-molecules a promising class of donor material for BHJ solar cell applications.61
Nguyen and co-workers reported a new thiophene-based oligomer (69) shown in Fig. 9 (Table 5) incorporating a t-Boc substituted DPP chromophore as the donor.62 The new donor molecule exhibited absorption extending to 720 nm in solution and to 820 nm in the film. The compound showed nanoscale ordering in the solid state as evidenced by very weak photoluminescence and fiber-like structures in AFM images. They fabricated the BHJ solar cells based on 69 as the donor and PCBM as the acceptor, obtaining a PCE of 2.3%. Later, they changed the alkyl substituent attached to the DPP core for ethylhexyl instead of t-Boc to tune the nanoscale ordering in the solid state.63 The ethylhexyl group made the donor material more soluble and thermally stable relative to the t-Boc derivative. With PC71BM as the acceptor, 70 showed a PCE of 3.0% with a large Jsc of 9 mA cm−2 and good spectral match to solar spectra with photo-response extended to 800 nm. Aiming to further understand pure and blended film morphology formation and how this affects device performance in small-molecule based BHJ solar cells, they also fabricated solar cell devices using a PCBM acceptor with different alkyl chains and with 70 as the donor.64 It was found that the degree of phase separation of the donor and acceptor was increased with methanofullerene having longer side chains. This was attributed to the differences in hydrophobicity of the methanofullerenes, which affects their interaction with the relatively more polar donor material. The solar cell efficiencies were decreased from 2.93% to 1.49% with longer side chain substitutes on the fullerene.

Reynolds and co-workers65 connected lateral hydrophilic triglyme chains to the DPP core and studied the self-assembly profile of the oligomer 71 and how the material behaved in solar cell devices. They found that the solubility of the molecule in organic solvents improved dramatically upon using the triglyme instead of the alkyl chain. However, due to undesirable phase separation, the devices based on 71 exhibited a relatively low PCE of 0.68%.
Short oligomers 72–75 shown in Fig. 9 were produced by Janssen's group66 who found that conjugation in solution was very limited due to steric hindrance of the side chains on the outer thiophenes of the monomer. This hindrance causes a twist in the backbone, thereby reducing the conjugation between the monomer units. However, in thin film, the absorption of the oligomers showed much stronger chain length dependence, indicating a more planar conformation. The absorption spectra of the oligomers showed a significant bathochromic shift from 720–730 nm to 850–860 nm observed in thin solid films upon aggregation.

        Ko and co-workers67 developed two compounds 76 and 77 to investigate the effects of the TPA moiety on the molecules. Compared to 76, compound 77 with triphenylamine showed red-shifted absorption and a significantly higher molar absorption coefficient. The HOMO level of 77 was more elevated than 76. Moreover, 77 exhibited one order higher hole mobility than 76, attributed to the contribution of the TPA moiety. The bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic devices with 77 obtained better efficiencies, showing the best PCE of 1.5% under 100 mW cm−2 with a Jsc of 5.73 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.45 and a Voc of 0.59 mV. Recently, a series of new bithiophene functionalized DPP chromophores 78a–f with varying electronic nature of the substituents at the 5-position of the terminal thiophene units were reported by Wurthner and co-workers.68 They explored the effect of peripheral substituents on the optical and electrochemical properties of these dyes and found that the absorption of 78e was broad and intense reaching in the NIR region, and 78f obtained high oxidation potential which was a prerequisite for achieving high open-circuit voltage. In order to increase the open-circuit voltage of the BHJ solar cells, Nguyen's group designed 79, using a fused benzofuran system.69 It was found that the new compound had a deep HOMO level and good absorption properties with large spectral coverage. The frontier orbitals of this donor system are appropriately matched with the common fullerene acceptor PC71BM, which resulted in an effective charge transfer process. After thermal annealing, the BHJ solar cell based on dye 79 and PC71BM exhibited increased conversion of 4.4% with a high Voc value under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2).
Fréchet and co-workers70 introduced triphenylamine and pyrene moieties onto the ends of the electron-deficient DPP units (80–86 shown in Fig. 10) to facilitate favorable end-to-end π–π interactions, leading to enhanced charge transport between adjacent molecules. Compound 82 exhibited the best efficiency of 2.7% among the four molecules, whereas 80, 81 and 86 exhibited lower device PCEs of 1.3%, 1.7% and 0.7%, respectively. Then they studied the compound 82 with various alkyl chains.
 Fig. 10  The structures of compounds 79–91. 
Molecule 83 with 2-hexyldecyl chains, exhibited the highest PCE of 4.1% with a high fill factor. Grazing-incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) pattern of a thin film BHJ of 83 and PC71BM showed that the packing of 83 was both more crystalline and more aligned than that of the other dyes, resulting in a high hole mobility. Ouyang's group introduced phenanthrene into the DPP-based molecules as the end group connected by single and triple bonds.71 The dyes 87 and 88 exhibited bandgaps of 1.6–1.8 eV and appropriate energy levels, and they could be soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform and tetrahydrofuran. The triple bond in ethynyl phenanthrene had a strong effect on the structure and properties of the molecules. It increased the rigidity of molecules, the crystallinity of the active layer and photovoltaic performance of the OPVs. The optimal photovoltaic efficiency of 88 was 1.71% under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2), more than double of that of molecule 87.
Recently, Luscombe et al.72 explored selenophene moieties connected to the DPP core and synthesized dyes 89 and 90 with a different number of selenophene groups, for use as the donor material in BHJ solar cells. Dye 90 with two selenophenes on each side showed broader absorption band that extends to the edge of the visible wavelengths and an increase in the molar absorptivity due to the greater π-conjugation length compared to dye 89. However, the HOMO level of 90 was higher than 89, leading to a decrease in open-circuit voltage. As a result, under optimized fabrication conditions, solar cells consisting of an active layer of 89/PC61BM showed a better PCE of 1.53%, while 90/PC61BM showed 0.84%.
Marks et al. reported the implementation of naphthadithiophene as the core donor with two thiophene-capped diketopyrrolopyrrole (TDPP) units as the acceptor on the two ends.73 This new compound, 91, exhibited high molar absorption coefficient of 1.1 × 105 L mol−1 cm−1 at 624 nm in solution and red-shifted to 676 nm with the spun cast film. It also showed low bandgap and low-lying HOMO and LUMO energy levels. As a result, in BHJ blends with the standard electron acceptor PC61BM, the molecules obtained a high PCE of 4.06% with a large open-circuit voltage of 0.84 V and high short circuit current density of 11.27 mA cm−2.
Bilayer BHJ solar cells
Some groups have developed dyads which covalently attached the donor and acceptor moieties to suppress phase segregation of the donor material and PCBM. These materials are able to be applied in bilayer devices. Meanwhile, owing to the proximity of the donor and the acceptor which leads to current generation, higher charge separation was obtained.
Tajima and co-workers74 synthesized low bandgap dyad molecules 92–94 shown in Fig. 11 (Table 6) with DPP units as the donor and a fullerene group as the acceptor to match the molecules' absorption spectra with the solar spectra. The absorption spectra of the dyads were broad and matched well with the solar spectra. The LUMO energy levels were almost the same as in PCBM, while the energy levels of the HOMO in the donor became higher-lying as the number of thiophenes increased, owing to the conjugation length in the donor part. Due to low bandgap properties and favorable hole transport properties, the device of 94 with three thiophenes showed the best power conversion efficiency of over 1% with a high Jsc and FF. Janssen et al.75 reported the synthesis of two oligomers 95 and 96 with C60 end-capped at both ends of the DPP unit and investigated the photo-induced energy and electron transfer reactions by photoluminescence, near steady-state PIA and fs-TA techniques. It was found that the electrons transfer directly from the excited DPP oligomer to the fullerene, the second route is a two-step process consisting of ultrafast energy transfer from the DPP-oligomer to the fullerene. It was concluded that the positive charge in the charge separated state is most likely not located on the center of the DPP oligomer, but rather asymmetrically on the thiophene/bithiophene unit next to the fullerene.

Hany's group76 developed two DPP-based semiconductors, 97 and 98, with branched ethyl-hexyl solubilizing alkyl chains and end capped with trifluoromethyl phenyl groups. These compounds show intense absorptions up to 700 nm, and thin film-forming characteristics that sensitively depend on the solvent and coating conditions. The two compounds were later applied into both BHJ and bilayer organic photovoltaic devices. Interestingly, the dye exhibited a better PCE of 3.4% when using EH-DPP-TFPV with C60 in a bilayer device configuration, while the BHJ device showed a PCE of only 1.4%.

          DPP based materials for DSSCs
Since the breakthrough was made by Grätzel and co-workers in 1991,77dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable interest for their simple preparation process, low cost and high efficiency of converting solar energy into electricity. The sensitizers developed by Grätzel's group have achieved record efficiency of almost 12%.78 Although being developed later than ruthenium dyes, metal-free sensitizers also attract much attention, and a high efficiency of 10.2% has been achieved for DSSCs using metal-free sensitizers.79
The excellent transportation properties of DPP as well as its good absorption of sunlight made it a good candidate to be applied in DSSCs as π-conjugators. Our group first reported the application of DPP small-molecules into dye-sensitized solar cells.80 We introduced this low bandgap conjugation into sensitizers resulting in greatly red-shifted and broadened absorption spectra. The absorption spectra of sensitizer 99 shown in Fig. 12 (Table 7) moved to 520 nm and the molar extinction coefficient was also improved. The dye showed a maximum monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 80% and overall conversion efficiency of 4.14% under standard global AM 1.5 solar light conditions. As for dye 100, the absorption spectra moved to 630 nm and the action spectra even extended to >800 nm. However, the sensitizer showed efficiency of only 1.45%. This is because the gap between the LUMO of the sensitizer and the conduction band of TiO2 was narrowed, resulting in a decrease of the driving force of injected electrons and low short-circuit photocurrent density. Later we modified 99 by changing the linker moiety between DPP and the carboxylic acid.81 Three different linkers were introduced to tune the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the molecules, as a result, the sensitizer 101 containing benzene, showed the best solar energy conversion efficiency of 6.03% for its higher Jsc which is attributed to a higher LUMO energy level. These dyes were also tested in a solvent-free ionic liquid electrolyte devices and the stability of the devices was performed over 2000 h at full sunlight. Sensitizer 100 containing the furan moiety exhibited good stability and better photovoltaic performance of up to 4.41% power conversion efficiency. Some D-π-A-π-D dye sensitizers, 103–104, containing octyl substituted DPP and with triphenylamine or methoxyl substituted triphenylamine as the electron donors were also synthesized in our lab.82 The dyes showed overall conversion efficiency of 2.68% under standard AM 1.5 solar light conditions.

Odobel and co-workers explored two DPP based dyes 105–106 respectively bearing cyanoacrylic acid and rhodanine acid anchoring groups, thus tuning the extent of the electronic communication with the semi-conducting oxide.83 Because the cyanoacrylic acid had the combination of a favourable dipolar moment interaction with TiO2, and more intimate orbital blending between the chemisorbed dye and the conduction band than the rhodanine acid, the photovoltaic performances showed the undisputable advantage of 105 over 106. The optimized solar cell reached a power conversion efficiency of 4.47% and 57% IPCE at 500 nm.
The DSSCs sensitized by polymers have also been investigated by various groups as polymers usually posses broad band intense spectral absorption in the visible light region. Patil and co-workers explored DPP-based conjugated copolymers for the first time as a sensitizer in solar cells.84 The polymers 107 and 108 can adsorb on the TiO2 surface through CO groups in their backbone instead of the carboxylic acid group. Both the copolymers showed broad absorption spectra with an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) band at 563 and 655 nm, respectively. 108 based DSSCs showed better power conversion efficiency due to the red-shifted and broadened absorption spectra and more negative LUMO level relative to 107.

          DPP applied as fluorescent chemosensors
Kanbara and co-workers reported a highly fluorescent DPP derivative (109, shown in Fig. 13) with amino groups synthesised by a Pd-catalyzed amination reaction.85 This new molecule showed a two-step response of fluorescence depending on acidity, which can be applied to colorimetric detection of acids in the gas phase. Zhang et al. devised a colorimetric and ratiometric fluorescent thiol probe, 110, with a DPP fluorophore.86 In the presence of thiols, such as cysteine, the absorption band shifted from 523 nm to 479 nm and the emission band shifted from 666 nm to 540 nm, respectively. Correspondingly, the color of the probe solution changed from purple to yellow, and the fluorescence changed from red to yellow. The probe is highly selective toward thiols, and the sensing mechanism was also demonstrated. Recently, two water-soluble cationic conjugated polyelectrolytes 111 and 112 containing DPP and fluorene units were synthesized.87 The two dyes allowed naked-eye detection of DNA with low concentrations and the detection of DNA with 111 and 112 was so selective that it was not interfered with by common ions.
 Fig. 13  The structures of compounds 109–115. 
Our group synthesized three new DPP based fluoride sensors 113–115 with red fluorescence, high sensitivity and selectivity.9 After addition of fluoride, the three sensors in DCM exhibited orange-to-red absorption color change and yellow-to-red emission color change, in which 115 showed the best sensitivity and detects fluoride concentrations in a range of 0–10 μM at visible region wavelengths. The color change was because the ICT effect from the amide anion to the electron-withdrawing moiety was enhanced due to deprotonation of the amide moiety in the presence of fluoride.

          DPP applied in two-photon absorption
Two-photon absorption has recently attracted considerable interest due to its potential applications in many areas, including two-photon fluorescence imaging, three-dimensional optical data storage, optical power limiting, and photodynamic therapy.88 Yang and co-workers reported two D-π-A-π-D type DPP derivatives 116 and 117 shown in Fig. 14, with end-capping diphenylamine and triphenylamine groups, respectively.89 The results showed that these two DPP-based conjugated molecules exhibit large two-photon absorption cross-sections with δ values of 900–1200 GM and emit a strong, red, two-photon excitation fluorescence.
 Fig. 14  The structures of compounds 116–118. 
We synthesized novel hyperbranched polyyne 118, containing DPP and triphenylamine as the core.10 The polymer in THF emits intense frequency up-converted fluorescence with the peaks located at 584 nm under the excitation of 140 fs, 800 nm pulses. The two-photon absorption cross section was determined to be 579 GM per repeating unit under the same conditions.
Conclusion and outlook
The application of the diketopyrrolopyrrole based dyes for organic solar cells, fluorescent chemosensors and two-photon absorption are reviewed in this feature article. For polymer bulk-heterojunction solar cells based on DPP, especially the thiophene connected DPP, moieties with low bandgaps and high photocurrent density were obtained due to broad absorption spectra. Through carefully tuning the HOMO–LUMO energy levels by connecting different electron donor parts, the power conversion efficiency can be enhanced effectively.90 In addition, the performance of the cells has been further improved by improving solubility of the materials and optimizing the device fabrication process. Meanwhile, for solvent processed small-molecule BHJs, the performance was also enhanced for broad and intense absorption spectra of the material containing DPP moieties. Dye-sensitized solar cells based on DPP sensitizers showed good performance and stability attributed to the excellent electron transporting capabilities as well as the splendid light absorption of DPP. The introduction of DPP moieties has significantly contributed to the development of organic solar cells. Moreover, the application of DPP in other fields as fluorescent chemosensors and two-photon absorption also showed vivid performance and would be meaningful for further exploration.
It is worth noting that DPP moieties connected with furan and thienothiophene have also showed excellent properties in photovoltaics, although with little exploration. It would be worthwhile to further functionalize DPP with more variety of heterocyclic compounds. Meanwhile, design of unsymmetrical DPP may also be a way of tuning the electron flow in the DSSCs. We believe that further functionalization of DPP materials will gain an even greater potential in the solar cell field.
