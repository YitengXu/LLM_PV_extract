    , Accepted 5th October 2018First published on 5th October 2018AbstractMicrogels (MGs) are crosslinked polymer colloid particles that swell in a good solvent. Although MGs have been studied for over 80 years their ability to control the morphology and optoelectronic properties of composite films containing photoactive materials is in its infancy. Solution processable hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites such as CH3NH3PbI3−zClz have attracted enormous fundamental and applied interest because of their outstanding optoelectronic properties. There is considerable interest in establishing methods to control perovskite film morphology, for example, using micropatterning. Here, hydrophilic poly(N-vinylformamide)-based MGs were dispersed in perovskite precursor solution which was then spin coated to deposit CH3NH3PbI3−zClz/MG films for the first time. Remarkably, the CH3NH3PbI3−zClz/MG composites formed disordered inverse opal (DIO) films. The CH3NH3PbI3−zClz/MG composition ranges which gave DIO films are identified using a phase diagram. The pore wall thickness is shown to be controlled by the volume fraction of MGs used and a simple model is presented to explain this behaviour. The MGs not only caused CH3NH3PbI3−zClz to be more efficiently deposited but also increased light absorption and photoluminescence intensity. Demonstration solar cells constructed containing the DIO CH3NH3PbI3−zClz/MG films had an average conversion efficiency of 6.58 ± 0.81%. A mechanism for DIO film formation is discussed. The principles established in this study wherein MGs control the morphology and properties of CH3NH3PbI3−zClz/MG films should also apply to other perovskite/MG composites.
Introduction
Microgels (MGs) are crosslinked polymer colloid particles that swell in a thermodynamically good solvent.1–7 They have been studied for at least 80 years8 and were used more than 20 years ago to form surface coatings in the automotive industry.9 MGs have unique rheological and (reversible) space-filling properties as a consequence of the tendency of these particles to (reversibly) swell.1 They are also good film formers. Hydrophilic (water-swellable) or hydrophobic (solvent-swellable) MGs can be prepared using scalable free-radical polymerisation methods by selecting the appropriate monomers.1 In recent years the potential of MGs to form composite films with photoactive materials (such as conjugated polymers) has begun to be explored.10,11 Polystyrene MGs were blended with the conjugated polymers used for the hole transport matrix (HTM) in hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and enabled a more efficient use of those expensive polymers.11 However, there have not been any studies reported where MGs have been included within the photoactive layer of PSCs. Here, MAPbI3−zClz/MG composite films (where MA is CH3NH3+) are prepared and investigated for the first time. The aim of the work was to study the role of the MGs in controlling the morphology and optoelectronic properties of these new photoactive composite films.
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites continue to attract enormous research attention as photoactive layers within solar cells,12–25 photodetectors26 and light emitting diodes.27 Perovskites can be solution processed and have panchromatic absorption,28 low exciton binding energies,29 high exciton diffusion lengths30 and are defect tolerant.31 PSCs may well play an important role in future renewable energy generation.32 An emerging area of perovskite research is pattering the material to achieve potentially useful geometries, such as fibres.33 Here, we introduce and investigate a new one-step deposition approach that creates (and allows control of) pores within perovskite films. The study also presents demonstration PSCs where the MGs are included within the perovskite photoactive layer for the first time. In our earlier work hydrophobic polystyrene MGs were included in the HTM of PSCs. They were blended with hydrophobic conjugated polymer HTM and were not mixed with perovskite. Here, we show that hydrophilic poly(N-vinylformamide-co-2-(N-vinylformamido)ethyl ether) (PNVF–NVEE) MGs cause micropatterning of MAPbI3−zClz to form disordered inverse opal (DIO) morphology. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows how the PNVF-based MGs used in this study differ in composition, hydrophilicity and location in the PSCs to the polystyrene MGs used earlier.11
Inverse opal (IO) films are porous materials containing monodisperse pores with long range order and have been widely studied for optical and electronic applications.34–36 IO perovskite films have been prepared using multi-step approaches involving colloidal particle templates which are subsequently removed.37,38 The IO perovskite films have exhibited highly ordered morphologies with tuneable reflectivity and good PCEs.37,38 However, the existing methods used to prepare IO films require delicate and time-consuming assembly procedures.37–39 In contrast disordered inverse opal (DIO) films have a lower degree of long-range order and are scalable.40 Such films can provide strong light scattering.40,41 Here, we investigate the physical chemistry principles governing the formation of DIO perovskite films using MG micropatterning for the first time.
We selected PNVF–NVEE MGs for this study because these hydrophilic particles swell in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which is a polar solvent that is used widely for perovskite film deposition.42Scheme 1 depicts the approach used to prepare our DIO MAPbI3−zClz/MG films. The MGs were synthesised by dispersion polymerisation which is a scalable method (Scheme S1, ESI†). NVF is an amide and is structurally similar to dimethylformamide (DMF), which is also a widely used solvent for perovskite deposition. DMF forms complexes with the PbI2 precursor43 and the adducts affect perovskite crystallisation. One aim of this study was to investigate whether the MGs provide a template around which MAPbI3−zClz crystallises. As shown in Scheme 1 the MGs were dispersed in DMSO containing the perovskite precursors (PbCl2 and MAI) and then spin coated onto a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold (mp-TiO2). The latter method is commonly used for the preparation of PSCs.12,44 The code used to identify the MAPbI3−zClz/MG films is shown in the Scheme 1 caption.
 Scheme 1  Diagram showing the preparation of disordered inverse opal (DIO) MAPbI3−zClz/MG films. The code used to denote the films is MPxMGy where x and y are the nominal concentrations of MAPbI3−zClz and MG used to prepare the films. The architecture used is suited to optoelectronic studies including PSC measurements. MA, NVF, meso, bl and ITO are CH3NH3+, N-vinylformamide, mesoporous, blocking layer and indium tin oxide, respectively. During spin coating some of the MAPbI3−zClz fills the pores in the meso-TiO2 layer and the remainder covers that surface as a MAPbI3−zClz/MG capping layer. Toluene antisolvent is added during spin coating to accelerate MAPbI3−zClz crystallisation. 
After first characterising the MGs, the morphologies of the MPxMGy films are studied using SEM and AFM and a phase diagram is constructed. The morphology and optoelectronic properties of the MPxMGy films are then studied and the effects of the MGs on these properties established. We also demonstrate that operational PSCs containing DIO MAPbI3−zClz/MG films can be prepared. Those PSCs had higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) than the control devices prepared without MGs. The study demonstrates that the MGs provide micropatterning of MAPbI3−zClz films with tuneable wall thickness. These behaviours are new both for MGs and perovskite films. A mechanism is proposed to explain the DIO film formation. It is highly likely that DIO films could be prepared with other MGs and perovskites using our new MG micropatterning approach.

MAI was synthesised and purified using the method previously reported.45 Titania paste (TiO2, 18 NRT) was purchased from Dyesol and used as received. Spiro-MeOTAD (Spiro, N2,N2,N2′,N2′,N7,N7,N7′,N7′-octakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetramine, Fenglin Chemicals, 99.5%) was also used as received. Water was of ultrahigh purity and de-ionised. NVEE was synthesised and characterised using the methods described previously.46
Microgel synthesis
PNVF–NVEE MGs were prepared by non-aqueous dispersion polymerisation following a method described previously.46 Briefly, a mixture of NVF (6.00 g, 85.5 mmol), PVP-co-PVA (1.80 g) and NVEE (1.79 g, 8.28 mmol) were added to ethanol (EtOH, 86 mL) in a round bottomed flask equipped with overhead stirrer, nitrogen supply and a reflux condenser. The solution was heated to 70 °C and stirred vigorously. Then, AIBN (0.240 g, 1.45 mmol) in EtOH (2.0 mL) was added and the polymerisation allowed to continue for 1 h. The dispersion was filtered after cooling to 0 °C with a 50 μm mesh filter and then purified by repeated centrifugation and re-dispersion in EtOH. To transfer the MGs from EtOH to DMSO, the MGs in EtOH were centrifuged and then redispersed in DMSO. The particles were centrifuged once more and re-dispersed in DMSO.
MAPbI3−zClz/MG composite film formation
ITO-coated glass substrates (20 Ω sq−1) were cleaned by ultrasonication in a 1.0 wt% Hellmanex solution, rinsed with water, followed by IPA, NaOH (2.5 M) and then rinsed with water and dried. A TiO2 hole blocking layer (bl-TiO2) (60 nm) was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s onto the ITO using TDP solution in 1-butanol (0.15 M) and subsequent heating at 125 °C for 5 min. The process was repeated using a 0.30 M TDP solution. After that, TiO2 paste (1:5 in EtOH) was spin coated at 5000 rpm for 30 s onto the cleaned ITO substrate to form a mesoporous scaffold (meso-TiO2). The meso-TiO2 film (thickness ∼250 nm) was annealed at 500 °C for 30 min and cooled to room temperature. Then a MAPbI3−zClz precursor solution in DMSO (100 μL) containing MGs was spin-coated onto ITO/bl-TiO2/meso-TiO2 substrate at 4000 rpm for 25 s. The MAPbI3−zClz/MG films are denoted as MPxMGy where x and y are, respectively, the concentrations of MAPbI3−zClz (assuming 100% conversion) and MG in the mixed solution used for spin coating. The MAPbI3−zClz solution contained the precursors MAI and PbCl2 at a 3:1 molar ratio. During the spin coating process, toluene (500 μL) was dripped onto the surface at a uniform rate over the last 15 s. The nominal compositions of the MPxMGy films studied are shown in Fig. 2. The films were dried at 100 °C for 45 min and then stored in a desiccator over P2O5 in the dark until investigation.
Physical measurements
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were conducted using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS instrument (via cumulants analysis) and provided the z-average diameter (dz) and polydispersity index (PDI) for the dispersed MGs. The top view SEM images were obtained using a Philips XL30 FEGSEM. The cross-section SEM images and EDX spectra were obtained using a Carl Zeiss Sigma FE-SEM and an AG-ULTRA 55. The samples were coated with Au or Pd. AFM images were obtained using either a Bruker Multimode 8 or a Bruker Catalyst. AFM images were captured in ScanAsyst™ (Peak Force Tapping) mode. UV-visible spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer Lamda 25 UV-Vis spectrometer. Film thickness measurements were conducted using a Dektak 8 Stylus Profilometer (Bruker). XRD patterns were conducted using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (Cu-Kα). Films were scanned with a step size of 0.02°. The films were prepared under a nitrogen atmosphere and measured using an airtight holder. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS980 spectrometer. The beam was incident on the film surface side and an excitation wavelength of 480 nm was used.
Solar cell construction and power conversion efficiency measurements
Demonstration solar cells were prepared using MP37.5MG3.0 and compared with control MP37.5 devices. The procedure to prepare the ITO/bl-TiO2/meso-TiO2/MPxMGy films was described above. CBZ was used as the HTM solvent at room temperature. LiTFSI (4.8 μL, 520 mg mL−1) and TBP (8.0 μL) were also added to the Spiro solution following our method reported earlier.11 The Spiro HTM films (200 nm) were formed by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 20 s onto the MPxMGy films. The devices were coated with a gold layer (70 nm) using thermal evaporation. The geometry of these PSCs is depicted in Fig. 9. The ITO/bl-TiO2/meso-TiO2/MP37.5/Spiro/Au devices did not contain added MGs and were the control. Although both types of devices were not optimised for efficiency, they were prepared using identical conditions and are, therefore, directly comparable.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2420 Sourcemeter and 100 mW cm2 illumination (AM 1.5G) and a calibrated NREL certified Oriel Si-reference cell. An Oriel solar simulator (SOL3A) was used for these measurements. The active area of the devices (0.025 cm2) was determined using a square aperture within a mask. The data shown are from the reverse scan (Voc to Jsc) and the sweep rate was 100 mV s−1.
Results and discussion
Microgel characterisation
Our first attempts to include MGs within perovskite films employed hydrophobic polystyrene-based MGs from our previous work11 (see Fig. S1, ESI†). However, those MGs did not swell in DMSO which resulted in pronounced aggregation and poor quality MAPbI3−zClz/MG films. We next prepared hydrophilic PNVF–NVEE MGs46 because the repeat unit is structurally similar to DMF, which is a solvent for perovskite precursors.42 The PNVF–NVEE MGs were colloidally stable in all of the mixed solutions used and gave good quality films (see Fig. S2, ESI†). Hence, it was important for preparing good quality composite films that the MGs both dispersed and swelled in the MAPbI3−zClz solvent. This is because swollen MGs have enhanced dispersion stability.1
The MGs deposited from EtOH were spherical and had a number-average diameter (DSEM) of 913 ± 71 nm as determined by SEM (see Fig. 1A). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements showed the MGs had z-average diameters (dz) in EtOH and DMSO of 885 (PDI = 0.013) and 1125 nm (PDI = 0.088), respectively (Fig. 1B). The former value agrees with DSEM. The dz value measured in DMSO is larger than that for the MGs in EtOH because the particles swelled in the former solvent. The volume swelling ratio for the MG particles in DMSO is estimated as 2.1 from these dz values. This result shows that DMSO is a good solvent for PNVF–NVEE. The deposited MGs had a tendency for hexagonal close packing when deposited from DMSO as can be seen from Fig. 1C. AFM data measured for isolated MGs deposited from DMSO gave the average diameter and height as ∼1200 and 400 nm, respectively (see Fig. 1D). The AFM data show that the MGs substantially flattened after deposition. This behaviour is typical for MGs deposited from a good solvent10,47,48 and is due to solvent removal from adsorbed swollen MGs which favours shrinkage in the z-direction.

Using microgels to control the morphology of perovskite films
The MGs dispersed in DMSO containing the MAPbI3−zClz perovskite precursors were spin coated onto an ITO/bl-TiO2/meso-TiO2 substrate (see Scheme 1). The MPxMGy films were black which shows that perovskite formation occurred in the presence of the MGs (see Fig. S2, ESI†). SEM was used to construct a morphological phase diagram (see Fig. 2). The pure MG films (i.e., MGy) had isolated MG clusters at low y values which became more uniform films as y increased (see vertical series with x = 0). The pure MAPbI3−zClz films (i.e., MPx) are the horizontal sequence of images with y = 0. MP25 had an appearance similar to that of the meso-TiO2 because there was insufficient perovskite to fill the meso-TiO2 layer and produce a significant capping layer. In contrast MP37.5 and MP45 had large crystals in the capping layer as well as large gaps between the crystals. These large gaps are termed pinholes. Remarkably, the MPxMGy films from the blue shaded region of the phase diagram had a porous honeycomb-like DIO morphology. These films are the first examples of (disordered) IO-like perovskites deposited in a single step to the best of our knowledge.
 Fig. 2  Morphology phase diagram for MPxMGy films. The six films studied in detail are shown in red. The blue shaded area shows the region of the phase diagram where DIO films were formed. Scale bars: 5 μm. 
The DIO films are considered in more detail. We compare SEM images for the MP25MG3.0, MP37.5MG3.0 and MP45MG2.0 DIO films (Fig. 3A–C) with the respective MG-free MP25, MP37.5 and MP45 systems (Fig. 3D–F). (Lower magnification SEM images recorded for these films are shown in Fig. S3, ESI†) Hexagonal close packing of the pores is clearly evident (highlighted in Fig. 3A–C). Such packing was also present for deposited MGs (see Fig. 1C). Hence, the SEM data show that the MGs acted as a micropatterning species for MAPbI3−zClz.
 Fig. 3  SEM images obtained for (A) MP25MG3.0, (B) MP37.5MG3.0, (C) MP45MG2.0, (D) MP25, (E) MP37.5 and (F) MP45 films. Hexagonal packing is illustrated in A–C. SEM images are also shown for (G) MP30MG2.0, (H) MP30MG3.0 and (I) MP30MG4.0. The arrows in (G) show that small DIO islands formed around MG clusters. Scale bars: 5 μm. 
The SEM images for the MPxMG3.0 films (x = 25 and 37.5) show that the fraction of surface covered by the DIO film (θDIO) increased with increasing x (see Fig. 3A and B). θDIO also increased for MP30MGy (y = 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0) as y increased as shown in Fig. 3G–I. (See also the lower magnification SEM images in Fig. S3, ESI†). When these images are compared to those for the control films prepared without added MGs (Fig. 3D–F) it can be seen that the MGs increased the proportion of surface covered by perovskite. It follows that the MGs decreased the proportion of precursor ejected during film deposition which should reduce material waste as up to 90% can be lost49 during spin coating. This result can be explained by two phenomena: (i) MGs are well known to increase the viscosity of fluids50 and (ii) the film thickness of spin coated films increases with increasing fluid viscosity.51 The former occurs because MGs occupy an increased effective volume fraction when swollen and act rheologically as a thickening agent.
The pore diameter (DPore) and wall heights (H) of the DIO films were measured using SEM. The former values were obtained by averaging more than 100 pore diameters from three to four different sample areas. The average DPore values for the MP30MGy (y = 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0) films were 922 ± 83, 866 ± 79 and 812 ± 69 nm, respectively (see Table S1, ESI†). These data provide evidence that DPore decreased with increasing y. AFM images and line profiles were measured for MP25MG3.0, MP37.5MG3.0 and MP45MG2.0 films (see Fig. S4, ESI†). The average H values for the pores are estimated from these line profiles as 400, 650 and 900 nm, respectively. Whilst the data set used to estimate H was limited to these profiles we note that the value for MP37.5MG3.0 agrees well with the heights of the three walls evident from the SEM cross-section image (Fig. S6, ESI†, blue arrows). The data for MPxMG3.0 (x = 25 and 37.5) films suggest that H increased with increasing x. Hence, θDIO, DPore and H can be tuned using both x and/or y. We show below that the pore wall thickness (W) can also be tuned using x and y.
An important mechanistic observation from the SEM image for MP30MG2.0 (Fig. 3G) is that DIO formed in regions containing deposited MGs. Higher magnification images are shown in (Fig. S5, ESI†). The pore walls were located at the edges of the MGs. It follows that the MAPbI3−zClz film formed at the surfaces of the MGs. These data provide strong evidence that there was an attractive interaction between MAPbI3−zClz and the MGs. The MGs appeared to act as a template for MAPbI3−zClz crystallisation.

Fig. 4A and B show a higher magnification SEM image measured for MP37.5MG3.0. Several pores show MGs (arrows) located approximately at their centre. A cross-section for the film (Fig. 4C) shows a pore clearly. The walls between the pores comprise MAPbI3−zClx grains that extend from the top of the capping layer to the meso-TiO2/MAPbI3−zClx layer. The image also clearly shows a flattened MG (yellow arrow). We examined the compositional changes of C, N, Pb and I for cross-sections of a pore (Fig. 4D) and a wall (Fig. 4E) using EDX. (See Fig. S6, ESI,† for an additional SEM image of this region.) The scanned regions are the orange dotted lines. These data show the concentration of Pb and I increases in the capping layer (i) compared to the mp-TiO2/MAPbI3−zClz layer (ii), as expected. There is also a spike in the C concentration when the thin, flattened, MG is traversed (see asterisk in Fig. 4D). Such a spike was not present for the control wall scan (Fig. 4E). These data confirm the composite nature of MP37.5MG3.0.

(C) SEM image for a cross-section with a pore evident and a flattened MG. SEM and EDX spectra are shown for a pore (D) and a wall (E). The orange dotted lines show the regions scanned. The scale bars are 300 nm. The yellow, red and blue arrows highlight MGs, pores and walls, respectively. The asterisk in (D) coincides with the flattened MG (see text). 
To better understand the influence of the MGs on the DIO films the following equation was used to calculate the volume fraction of the MG in the collapsed state in the MPxMGy composite film (ϕMG) (1)where ρMG and ρMP are the densities of PNVF–NVEE and perovskite, respectively. These values were taken as 1.0 g cm−3 and 4.1 g cm−3, respectively.52 The ϕMG values for the DIO films varied from 0.154 for MP45MG2.0 to 0.353 for MP30MG4.0 (see Table S1, ESI†). The variations of W (measured from SEM using Image J and at least 100 walls) and DPore with ϕMG are shown in Fig. 5A and B, respectively. Fig. 5A shows that W decreased by ∼55% from 529 ± 184 nm to 226 ± 56 nm as ϕMG increased from 0.154 to 0.353. The maximum and minimum DPore values were 988 ± 60 nm and 657 ± 87 nm respectively and differed by ∼35%. Hence, the relative changes were greatest for W. Both W and DPore decreased with increasing ϕMG because the average inter-MG spacing decreased.
 Fig. 5  Variation of average (A) experimental and theoretical wall thicknesses (W) and (B) pore diameter for the DIO films with MG volume fraction (see text). The legend in (B) also applies to (A). 
A simple geometric model was used to derive eqn (2) which describes the variation of W for the DIO films in terms of ϕMG. (See ESI† for derivation.) (2)ϕMG(hcp-2D) is the volume fraction of hexagonally closed packed spheres in 2-dimensions. The value for D represents the MG diameter when the perovskite matrix crystallised. The derivation of eqn (2) is based on a hexagonal arrangement of the MGs within a continuous perovskite phase (see Fig. S7, ESI†). It is assumed for simplicity that the height of the pore walls is the same as the MG diameter (D). The MGs are assumed to have flattened after MAPbI3−zClx crystallisation. Fig. 5A shows calculated values for W from eqn (2) using D = 625 and 913 nm. The former value is the optimum value to fit the experimental W values; whereas, the latter value is DSEM. The fact that D < DSEM gave an optimum fit is due to the simplifications used in deriving this model. Nevertheless, eqn (2) generally captures the physics of DIO formation wherein W decreases as ϕMG increases. It follows from eqn (1) and (2) that W should decrease as x decreases or as y increases as both of these changes increase ϕMG. These trends are apparent from the data shown in Fig. 5A. It follows that the formation of the DIO films occurs by uniform spreading of the MGs in a locally ordered hexagonal arrangement with MAPbI3−zClx filling the spaces between MGs.
The effect of the MGs on the MAPbI3−zClx structure was investigated by obtaining X-ray diffraction data for the M25MG3.0, MP37.5MG3.0 and MP45MG2.0 DIO films as well as the respective MG-free films (see Fig. 6 and Table S2, ESI†). The presence of the MGs increased the intensity of the MAPbI3−zClz peaks. Furthermore, their average width at half-maximum decreased when MGs were included. The grain sizes for the films were calculated from the Scherrer equation53,54 and are shown in the figure. Whilst the average values were higher for the MPxMGy films there is considerable spread in the full width at half maximum values used to calculate the grain sizes (Table S2, ESI†). We conclude that there is some evidence that the grain size was increased for the MP37.5MG3.0 and MP45MG2.0 DIO films; however, more work is required to confirm this point.

Using microgels to control the optoelectronic properties of perovskite films
UV-visible spectra for the MPxMG3.0 (x = 0, 25, 30 and 37.5) films were measured to probe the effect of x on light absorption (see Fig. 7A). The MG particles did not absorb light in the wavelength range examined as shown by the data for MG3.0. The spectra show that as x increased the absorbance also increased. (See also the inset for Fig. 7A). This is due to more perovskite being deposited (see Fig. 3A and B). The effect of y on the UV-visible spectra can be seen from Fig. 7B which shows spectra for MP30MGy (y = 0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0). Including MGs strongly increased the light absorbed by the MP30MGy films for y ≥ 2.0 (see inset). The reason for this effect can be found from the measured values for θDIO (see Fig. 7C). (The latter values were measured from SEM images using Image J.) The MP30MGy film with the lowest absorbance values was MP30MG2.0 which had a low θDIO of 0.36. The data in Fig. 7C show that a minimum θDIO value of 0.75 (for MP30MG3.0) is required to obtain highly absorbing films.

(C) Variation of fractional surface coverage of DIO (θDIO) with ϕMG. (D) Variation of absorbance with fractional surface coverage of MAPbI3−zClz (θMP). The latter was calculated using eqn (4). 
The simple geometric model used to derive eqn (2) was extended for light absorption by the DIO films (see ESI† for the derivation and Fig. S8). It is assumed that the total absorbance (Abs) is the sum of the absorbance from the DIO capping layer (Abscap) and the underlying meso-TiO2/MAPbI3−zClz layer (Absmeso). For a fixed H the Abscap value will be proportional to the fraction of the surface covered by perovskite (θMP). The key equations are: (3) θMP = θMP(DIO)θDIO(4)In eqn (3)αMP is the absorption coefficient for MAPbI3−zClz. For eqn (4)θMP(DIO) is the fraction of the DIO film covered by MAPbI3−zClz and can be calculated using (5)
The measured values used for W are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). For simplicity, it was assumed that D was equal to DPore, i.e., that the pores are the negative image of the MGs. The θDIO values and calculated θMP(DIO) values (see Table S1, ESI†) were used to calculate θMP using eqn (4). Fig. 7D shows the absorbance values measured at 480, 740 and 800 nm plotted as a function of θMP. Linear relationships are evident. The parameters from the fits (Table S3, ESI†) can be compared to eqn (3). Using the gradient of 3.71 at a wavelength of 480 nm and the capping layer thickness for MP37.5MG3.0 (700 nm) for H then αMP = 1.2 × 107 m−1. The latter corresponds to an absorption depth of ∼80 nm which is reasonably close to the reported value of 100 nm.30 We stress that the purpose of this simplified model is to increase the understanding of how the MGs control light absorption and it should be considered a semi-quantitative guide to trends. Eqn (3)–(5) show how the MPxMGy film absorbance is controlled by the MG-dependent parameters W and D.
To further probe the optoelectronic properties PL spectra were measured. The effect of x was investigated for the MPxMG3.0 (x = 25, 30 and 37.5) films (see Fig. 8A). The PL intensity reached a plateau when x = 30 (see inset), which corresponds to extensive DIO film formation (θDIO = 0.75 from Fig. 7C). The effect of y was investigated for the MP30MGy (y = 0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0) films (see Fig. 8B). The PL intensity increased strongly when y = 3.0 (see inset) due to extensive DIO film formation (see Fig. 7C). Thus, increasing x or y increased θDIO which, in turn, increased the PL intensity. A high PL intensity indicates decreased quenching. As θDIO increases more MAPbI3−zClz is located further from the meso-TiO2 and is less able to be quenched.55 Accordingly, we interpret the increased PL intensity as being the result of MG micropatterning. In support of this proposal the maximum PL intensity for all of the systems are plotted against θMP (see Fig. 8C) The PL intensities for the films with θMP > 0.21 are a factor of two or more higher than those with lower θMP values. The former films correspond to major DIO film coverage, i.e., θDIO > 0.74.

An interesting question is what effect the MG particles have on the ability of MAPbI3−zClz to function as photoactive layer in a PSC. This question was addressed by constructing preliminary solar cells of MP37.5MG3.0 and MP37.5. The device architecture for the MP37.5MG3.0 device is shown in Fig. 9. The aim of these measurements was to evaluate the effect of MG micropatterning on the device performance. Neither MP37.5MG3.0 or the MP37.5 control devices were optimised. The representative J–V data demonstrate that operational MP37.5MG3.0 PSCs were prepared. The average PCE for the MP37.5MG3.0 devices (6.58 ± 0.81%) was significantly higher than that for the control MG37.5 devices (4.86 ± 0.75%). It is noted that these PCE values are low compared to PSCs prepared using processing that focus on achieving PCE values greater than 20%.56 The presence of pinholes (Fig. 3) is likely a major cause for the relatively low PCE values obtained in these preliminary devices. Nevertheless, the measured performance data are encouraging because they demonstrate that MGs can not only micropattern perovskite films, but that such DIO MAPbI3−zClz films provide operational PSCs. Device optimisation is planned for future work.

Finally, a mechanism for the DIO film formation based on the data shown above is proposed. The key assumptions are that (i) the MG particles deposit onto the surface initially in a swollen state and (ii) the MGs flatten considerably after MAPbI3−zClz crystallisation is complete. Spin coating of the mixed DMSO solution containing the MAPbI3−zClz precursors and the MGs caused MG deposition onto the meso-TiO2 surface. Some of these precursors infiltrated the meso-TiO2 scaffold. Excess precursor crystallised in the capping layer. Crystallisation began as the DMSO was removed by evaporation together with addition of the anti-solvent. Toluene is a poor solvent for the MGs and MAPbI3−zClz and promotes both MG collapse and perovskite crystallisation.57,58 The results suggest that crystallisation was completed before the MGs flattened. The perovskite phase covered the MGs (which appeared to act as nucleation templates) and the thickness of this layer was smallest at the top of the MGs and largest between the MGs. As the MGs flattened the thin perovskite “roof” collapsed (if fully formed) to reveal a pore and the flattened MG (see Fig. 4B). The crystallised DIO MAPbI3−zClz pores can be thought of as the negative image of the MGs before they flattened.
Conclusions
In this study we included amide-based MGs in the solution used to prepare MAPbI3−zClz films and demonstrated that the MGs directed formation of a DIO capping layer for the first time. We identified the region of the MAPbI3−zClz/MG phase diagram where DIO films formed. A simple geometric model was able to capture the relationship between ϕMG and the pore wall width. The MGs also increased the light absorption and PL intensity by promoting DIO formation. The light absorption was shown to be proportional to the fraction of MAPbI3−zClz in the capping layer which was, in turn, controlled by ϕMG. Preliminary device data showed that MGs provided PSCs with improved PCE values compared to control MG-free devices. Overall, the MGs had the role of a mesoscopic-scale micropatterning additive which controlled both the morphology and optoelectronic properties of these new photoactive MAPbI3−zClz/MG composite films. These behaviours occurred because the MGs were colloidally stable in the deposition solvent and also deswelled and flattened after perovskite crystallisation. Indirect evidence was presented for an interaction between the MGs and perovskite. Following a recent study involving poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) stabilised MAPbI3−zClz59 we speculate that the attractive interaction originated from hydrogen bonding between the amide carbonyl group and the amine proton of MA+ which promoted crystallisation at the surface of the MGs and helped direct film formation. Because both repeat units of the MG contain such carbonyl groups (Scheme S1, ESI†) they could have both contributed to this effect. Further work is required to verify the exact mechanism responsible for the interaction between the MGs and MAPbI3−zClz apparent from this study. The new one-step deposition method introduced in this study to prepare DIO MAPbI3−zClz/MG films should be applicable to other perovskites and MGs. In our future work we plan to decrease the size of the MGs to reduce the absorbance of the photoactive layer with the aim of establishing semitransparent PSCs where the DIO perovskite photoactive layer is deposited in one step.

 	Scheme 1  Diagram showing the preparation of disordered inverse opal (DIO) MAPbI3−zClz/MG films. The code used to denote the films is MPxMGy where x and y are the nominal concentrations of MAPbI3−zClz and MG used to prepare the films. The architecture used is suited to optoelectronic studies including PSC measurements. MA, NVF, meso, bl and ITO are CH3NH3+, N-vinylformamide, mesoporous, blocking layer and indium tin oxide, respectively. During spin coating some of the MAPbI3−zClz fills the pores in the meso-TiO2 layer and the remainder covers that surface as a MAPbI3−zClz/MG capping layer. Toluene antisolvent is added during spin coating to accelerate MAPbI3−zClz crystallisation.
