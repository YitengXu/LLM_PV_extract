    , Accepted 10th October 2016First published on 13th October 2016AbstractThe fierce controversy of the band gap of InN from 0.6 to 2.3 eV has been debated for nearly fifteen years. Numerous possible reasons, such as the Moss–Burstein effect, oxygen incorporation and indium:nitrogen stoichiometry, have been postulated to interpret this outstanding issue. Nevertheless, none of them can provide a convincing and comprehensive explanation. Here, we shed new light on this notable debate using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations based on many-body perturbation theory combined with experiments. We demonstrate that the ubiquitous surface nanostructures (NSs) with amazing characteristics, that is, the outgrowth needle- or dot-like nanocrystals of the InN film surface, are vital and significantly alter its electronic structure and optical properties. The valence band inversion in the decreasing order of crystal-field split-off hole and heavy/light hole can occur in these NSs, which leads to an optical transition switch from E ⊥ c in bulk InN to E ‖ c in surface InN NSs. Moreover, the strong surface bound excitons can be induced in InN NSs due to quantum confinement, resulting in the exciton absorption/emission from infrared to visible (green) wavelength. The blue shift of the PL peak in InN quantum dots with decreasing size further provides convincing evidence for the essence of the large variable band gap of InN. The electronic structure, optical polarization properties and especially the strong exciton effect of InN NSs have been investigated systematically and comprehensively and lays the foundation for future applications of InN QD based photovoltaic and light-harvesting devices.
1 Introduction
InN/InGaN based solar cells have attracted much interest during recent decades due to their continuously tunable band gap within the full energy range of the solar spectrum (see Fig. 1a).1,2 InGaN alloys exhibit a much higher resistance against high-energy proton irradiation damage (∼2 MeV) than previous photovoltaic materials such as GaAs and GaInP, and therefore offer great potential for radiation-hard and high-efficiency solar cells, which power space satellites used for communications, defense and scientific research.3 Moreover, a strong phonon bottleneck effect in InN due to its wide phononic band gap and narrow phonon band width presents interesting opportunities for applications in hot-carrier solar cells, that is, the thermalization of photoexcited carriers are slowed down to allow sufficient time for the carriers to be extracted while they are still “hot”, and thus achieve a high photovoltage.4–7 In addition, advantageous band alignment with respect to Si, i.e., the valence band maximum (VBM) of Si lining up with conduction band minimum (CBM) of InGaN alloys, makes them suitable candidates for Si base solar cells with recombination junctions.

Schematic diagram of InN QD intermediate band solar cell with vertically stacked QD layers (d). 
On the basis of Shockley's detailed balance theory, the power conversion efficiency limit of a single p–n junction solar cell is 30%, which is much lower than that of multiple quantum well (MQW) solar cells (44.53%).8 The maximum solar energy conversion efficiency ∼43% has been achieved in triple-junction cells based on GaInP/GaInAs/Ge.9 In order to further improve the conversion efficiency, multi-junction structures, with four or more junctions, are needed, which increases the complexity of the epitaxial process inevitably and receives limited enhancement of the cell performance. Fortunately, QD intermediate band (QDIB) solar cells fabricated by periodic QD arrays for the formation of intermediate bands provide a new avenue to realize a higher conversion efficiency (up to 63.1% in theoretical prediction).10 A recent study of embedded InN QDs within InGaN as the absorption layer has shown the potential to improve the performance of nitride-based solar cells.11 The power conversion efficiency increases by decreasing the InN QD layer, as is shown in Fig. 1b. Moreover, both the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of the p–i–n a-Si:H cells coated with InN QDs exhibit an approximate 8% enhancement compared with their pristine counterparts (see Fig. 1c).12
Obviously, the unique advantages of InN have made it a hotspot for the huge application of InN/InGaN based photovoltaic cells, white-light diodes and other optoelectronic devices in recent years.13–15 The perfect match of the band gap of InGaN with the full-solar-spectrum strongly depends on the InN band gap, a highly disputed and scattered value from 0.6 to 2.3 eV (see Fig. 1a and ref. 16), which is particularly embarrassing for the complete understanding of its interband optical transition mechanism and related photovoltaic and optoelectronic device applications. On the basis of the absorption data published in 1986 for a radio-frequency (RF) sputtered InN film with high mobility and low carrier concentration, the band gap of InN seemed to be settled at a value of 1.89 eV.17 Then largely but not exclusively InN samples grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) indicate a smaller band gap, initially reported at 1.1 eV but later at a lower value of 0.90 eV, and then even as low as 0.6–0.7 eV has been proposed.18–24 Nevertheless, the full range of the reported experimental band gaps of InN are still poorly understood up to now. Suggestions for the observed large band gaps have included a strong Moss–Burstein effect, oxygen inclusion, quantum size effect and stoichiometry changes.25–27 Explanations for the small energy band gaps have included defects, non-stoichiometry, film non-uniformity and Mie resonance.28–30 Many of the suggested reasons, such as the Moss–Burstein effect, provide a partial explanation, whereas the role of oxygen alloying has been discounted.16,25 Unfortunately, no single solution has been successful in describing the large variable band gap of InN. Although progress has been made, a reasonable explanation remains elusive and the physical origin of the wide variation in InN band gap is still unclear and needs to be further clarified.
Our purpose here is to reveal the origin of dramatic deviation in experimental band gaps of InN from 0.6 to 2.3 eV using state-of-the-art first-principles calculations based on many-body perturbation theory combined with the experimental results. We demonstrate that the ubiquitous surface nanostructures (NSs) with amazing characteristics, that is, the needle- or dot-like surface nanocrystals are formed owing to the outgrowth of InN film with nonuniform surface, are vital and provide a new way to re-recognize the hot debate of InN band gap. Compared with bulk InN, these NSs can cause strong surface bound excitons due to the significant quantum confinement, resulting in the exciton absorption/emission from infrared to visible (green) wavelengths. The blue shift of the PL peak in InN quantum dots (QDs) with decreasing size further proves our perspective of quantum confinement from InN NSs. We thus clarify the large variable band gap of InN related to the surface InN NSs.
2 Results and discussion
Our calculated band structure of bulk InN using the GW method is shown in Fig. 2a, and is in good agreement with previous experimental and calculation results.31–33 In order to overcome the significant band gap underestimation in conventional DFT, Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) and GW approaches have been gradually adopted in recent years.34–37 Especially for low-dimensional structures, such as nanowires and QDs, quasiparticle correction is necessary owing to the quantum confinement caused by their nanoscale size. We can see from Fig. 2b that the strong quantum confinement opens the electronic band gap to 3.61 eV in InN NSs. Meanwhile, it causes an inversion for the order of the degenerate heavy/light hole (HH/LH) bands and the crystal-field-split hole (CH) band. The energy difference between the inverted bands changes from −35 to 193 meV at point Γ. This band reordering affects the selection rule of the interband optical transitions and makes the polarization of photon absorption/emission switch from E ⊥ c in bulk InN to E ‖ c in InN NSs.

Fig. 3a shows the partial density of states (DOS) for InN NS, from which we can see the domination of the nitrogen pz state (CH band) at the VBM compared with the degenerated HH/LH bands for InN NSs. This suggests the higher excitation probability of electrons distributed along the c axis, which directly determines the polarized mode of band edge absorption/emission at point Γ. Furthermore, the distributions of charge density for the top three valence bands shown in Fig. 3b provide the most direct evidence for the valence band inversion.

Our calculations also reveal that quantum confinement can shift the optical transitions of InN from the infrared to visible wavelength range. The calculated imaginary part of the dielectric functions, closely related to the optical absorption, is shown in Fig. 4a for the InN NSs. The exciton absorption/emission occurs at 2.26 eV within the visible (green) region. The exciton binding energy, given by the difference between the electronic and optical band gaps, is found to be 1.35 eV. The substantial increase of the binding energy, compared with bulk InN (∼20 meV),38 apparently reflects the significant quantum confinement and incomplete dielectric screening in InN NSs. Moreover, we compare the boundary onsets of optical transitions in bulk InN and NSs (see Fig. 4b), which clearly exhibit dramatic deviations almost covering the full range of the reported experimental values.

Fig. 5 shows the available experimental data for the band gap of InN synthesized by different methods.17,18,21,27,39–46 We can see from Fig. 5 that the band edge absorption/emission due to exciton transition is located within the region of 2.26 eV for InN NSs and 0.66 eV for bulk InN. Meanwhile, the band gap spreads over a wide range of carrier concentration from 1016 to 1021 cm−3, indicating the invalidation of the previous well-accepted Moss–Burstein effect. It remains true that the InN films with large band gap have largely been produced by RF or direct current (DC) sputtering.39,40,45,46 As for those fabricated by MBE, single crystal films with a small band gap are very common, nevertheless, large band gap samples have also been produced.22,24,41 Therefore, growth methods should not be the cause of such large variability in band gap for InN.

As a matter of fact, with the improvement of epitaxial techniques, the quality of InN films synthesized by MBE has become higher than those fabricated by the previous sputtering method. However, the surface uniformity of InN films is still influenced by the epitaxial growth conditions, such as temperature, pressure and III–V stoichiometry.48 The surface roughness caused by crystal outgrowths naturally leads to the formation of massive needle- or dot-like InN NSs distributed on the film’s outermost layer (see Fig. 6a–d), and has also been observed in previous reports but received little attention.47,49,50 Considering the ubiquity of nanoscale InN NSs in epitaxial InN films (please refer to Fig. 6a–d and ref. 47, 49 and 50) and the well-converged total energy as well as residual force (see our DFT calculations in subsection 3.2), we believe that the surface InN NSs can exist stably. In comparison with inner bulk InN, these surface InN NSs are directly exposed to a vacuum, leading to their electronic characteristics and optical properties being completely different from the inner bulk. Consequently, quantum confinement is extremely significant in these surface NSs due to their nanoscale size, which opens the electronic band gap of small InN NSs (∼1 nm) up to 3.61 eV with strong surface bound excitons at 2.26 eV and determines the optical transition of InN from infrared in the bulk to visible (green) wavelengths in NSs.

It is known that intrinsic vacancy defects are inevitable in epitaxial materials, and InN is no exception. We thus investigate the distribution of vacancy defects (VIn and VN), as is shown in Fig. 7a. Our calculations reveal that the inner VIn and VN defects of the InN film exhibit a large formation energy. Nevertheless, the formation energy of these vacancy defects decreases remarkably with their migration from interior to surface, which indicates that both VIn and VN are inclined to assemble at the surface layer of the InN film. Actually, the large surface area provides a region for the defects to gather and permits an efficient elastic relaxation of atoms for stress release. If these defects exist in the interior of the InN film, they will need extra energy to break down the inner perfect crystal structure and the whole system requires a large lattice relaxation. It is the migration of vacancy defects from the interior to the surface that automatically results in the formation of different-size InN NSs on the film’s outermost layer (see Fig. 6a–d). Furthermore, the local density of states (LDOS) for the InN NSs shown in Fig. 7b clearly indicates that the important band edge states, i.e., VBM and CBM, are dominated by the surface atoms. Hence the crucial interband optical transitions in the InN NSs are mainly determined by its surface atoms rather than the inner atoms. As a result of the optical excitation producing electron–hole (e–h) pairs, the enhanced e–h interaction can form strong bound excitons localized within the surface InN NSs, which determines the high-energy absorption/emission (green wavelength) in InN.

In order to clarify the relationship between the band gap of InN and quantum confinement in InN NSs, we further investigate the optical characteristics of InN QDs with different sizes, which is shown in Fig. 6. Considering that these InN NSs on the rough surface of InN film are most similar to tiny InN QDs in terms of size and morphology (see Fig. 6a–d), we believe both of them share the same electronic characteristics. The PL peak energy and the calculated optical transition energy of InN QDs are shown in Fig. 6f, from which an obvious blue shift of the PL with decreasing QD size can be observed. This clearly indicates that quantum confinement plays a key role in the optical absorption/emission for these InN NSs. Fig. 6f also shows that our calculated optical transition energies for InN NSs with different sizes are in good agreement with experiments. The significant size-dependent transition behavior in InN NSs is thus confirmed. Meanwhile, an inversion for the order of the HH/LH and CH bands at VBM can be induced with increasing the InN NS size, which indicates a gradual variation of the polarized absorption/emission from E ‖ c in InN NSs to E ⊥ c in bulk InN.
As stated above, we can confirm that the surface InN NSs are responsible for the large variable band gap of InN. The physical reasons can be summarized as follows. (i) The inversion of the top valence bands, in the decreasing order of CH and HH/LH bands, results in the polarization of photon absorption/emission switch from E ⊥ c in bulk InN to E ‖ c in InN NSs due to its strong quantum confinement. (ii) The optical transition from bound excitons localized within the surface InN NSs determines the visible (green) wavelength emission and the transition energy almost covers the full range of experimental gap values. (iii) Intrinsic vacancy defects are inevitable in epitaxial materials, and InN is no exception. Moreover, both VIn and VN are inclined to gather at the surface layer of the InN film, which is of great benefit for forming the different size surface InN NSs. (iv) The blue shift of the PL peak energy in InN QDs with decreasing size further provides convincing evidence for the wide variation (0.6–2.3 eV) of InN band gap. This is the essence of the large variable band gap of InN and we thus offer an in-depth explanation for this outstanding issue.
We would like to emphasize that the electronic structure, inversion of optical polarization mode, and especially the strong exciton effect of InN NSs have been revealed systematically and comprehensively, which lays the foundation for the future application of InN QD based photovoltaic and light-harvesting devices. The enhanced power performance has been observed in QD-involved cells, such as polycrystalline Si solar cells with Si nanoparticles, InGaP/GaAs dual-junction cells with InAs QDs and InGaN solar cells embedded with InN QDs.11,51–53 Therefore, we suggest that future work should be focused on the controllable synthesis of nanoscale InN QDs and careful optimization of their size and morphology, although the reliable fabrication of InN QDs in the few-nanometer size range is still challenging. Currently available InN nanocrystals and nanowires exhibit diameters as small as 1.3 and 10 nm, respectively.54,55 Moreover, the investigation of performance improvement by fabricating vertically aligned InN QD layers with different sizes in previous III-nitride cells is necessary (see Fig. 1d). Most importantly, the in-depth modeling and simulation work for the influence of embedded InN QDs on epitaxial materials, such as GaN or AlN, needs to be studied in detail to understand the strong confinement effect and polarized absorption between the embedded InN QDs and epilayers.
3 Materials and methods
3.1 Synthesis of InN film and QDs
InN films and QDs are grown by SVTA RF plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PA-MBE) on GaN templates. For InN layers, slightly In-rich growth conditions are maintained with a nitrogen flow rate of ∼1.2 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm), RF plasma forward power of 400 W, and In beam flux of ∼1.0 × 10−6 Torr. The InN QDs are grown by a droplet epitaxy technique. The In droplet formation is conducted with an In beam flux of ∼5 × 10−7 Torr for 6 s, and interrupt for 30 s. Then, nitridation treatment is carried out for 2 min with the same nitrogen conditions for layers to form InN QDs.
3.2 DFT and GW calculations
The theoretical calculations are based on density functional theory (DFT) performed by using the VASP code.56–58 During our DFT calculations, the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and hybrid functional HSE06 are adopted.35,36 The In (5s25p14d10), N (2s22p3) and H (1s1) are considered as valence electrons. The energy cutoff is set to 550 eV and structural optimization with enough k-point sampling (1 × 1 × 6) is carried out until the maximum energy difference and residual forces converge to 10−5 eV and 0.01 eV Å−1. The GW correction and Bethe–Salpeter equation calculations are carried out using a BerkeleyGW package.59 For the quasiparticle calculations performed with the BerkeleyGW code, the ground-state Kohn–Sham wave functions and eigenvalues are obtained using a local density approximation (LDA) exchange–correlation functional with Troullier–Martins norm-conserving pseudopotentials,60,61 as implemented in Quantum Espresso code.62 A kinetic energy cutoff of 150 Ry is used for the wave function. In order to eliminate the interaction between periodic images of InN NSs in adjacent supercells, the lateral dimensions are chosen as 30 Å. During the GW calculations, we chose a 1 × 1 × 8 k-point mesh, which yields quasiparticle energy converged within ±0.1 eV. To perform the Bethe–Salpeter equation calculations, we interpolate the e–h interaction kernel on a 1 × 1 × 24 k-point mesh. This choice of parameters yields well-converged exciton eigenenergy and sufficient accuracy in our calculations.
3.3 Defect formation energy
The defect formation energy is simply the reaction energy to create a defect from a perfect structure, which provides an effective way to investigate the formation and distribution of the defects in the whole system. The defect formation energy Ef of a defect α in the charge state q can be calculated as follows,  where E(α,q) is the total energy of a InN sample containing a defect α in charge state q, E(perfect) is the total energy of the same InN supercell without defects, ni is the atom number of the ith constituent, which has been added to (ni > 0) or removed from (ni < 0) the perfect InN sample, and μi is the corresponding chemical potential. EF is the Fermi level referenced to the VBM EV of InN.
4 Conclusions
On the basis of the advanced first-principles calculations with many-body perturbation theory and experimental results, we resolve the near-fifteen year long debated issue for the large variable band gap (0.6–2.3 eV) of InN. We prove that the novel surface InN NSs with amazing characteristics, widely existed in epitaxial InN films, are profound and have a significant influence on the electronic characteristics and optical properties of InN. The valence band inversion in the decreasing order of CH and HH/LH can occur in these NSs, which results in the optical transition switch from E ⊥ c in bulk InN to E ‖ c in surface InN NSs. Moreover, the surface InN NSs can induce strong surface bound excitons due to quantum confinement, leading to the exciton absorption/emission from infrared to visible (green) wavelengths in InN. The blue shift of the PL in InN QDs by decreasing their size further provides convincing evidence for the essence of the wide variation of InN band gap. We thus clarify the physical origin of the InN band gap controversy related to surface InN NSs and offer an in-depth explanation for this outstanding issue. The electronic structure, optical polarization properties, and especially the strong low-dimensional confined exciton effect of InN NSs have been investigated carefully, which is very useful for InN QD based photovoltaic and light-harvesting device applications.
