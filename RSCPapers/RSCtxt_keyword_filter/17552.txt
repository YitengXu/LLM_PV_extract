    , Accepted 9th November 2020First published on 11th November 2020AbstractHere we report a solution processed environmentally friendly MoS3 hole-transport material for Sb2Se3 solar cells, where MoS3 exhibits a matched energy level relative to Sb2Se3. In the synthesis, H2S produced by the thermal decomposition of (NH4)2MoS4 is found to efficiently eliminate the antimony oxide impurity formed on the Sb2Se3 surface. Finally, the all-inorganic Sb2Se3 solar cell delivers an efficiency of 6.86% with excellent stability.
Antimony selenide, Sb2Se3, has attracted great attention in solar cell applications due to its suitable optical band gap, abundant elemental reserves and excellent stability.1,2 Recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase in the efficiency of antimony chalcogenide-based devices. Most recently, both Sb2Se3 and alloy-type Sb2(S,Se)3 solar cells have achieved around 10% power conversion efficiency (PCE).1,3 Great efforts have been devoted to the fabrication of high-quality Sb2Se3 thin films, an emerging solar material. In principle, to further improve the performance of Sb2Se3 based solar devices, exploration of efficient and stable functional layers has to be considered. Furthermore, in terms of practical applications, it is desirable to develop more environmentally friendly functional layer materials along with convenient material processing.
The introduction of hole-transport layers (HTLs) to construct n–i–p structures is an important strategy to improve the hole extraction and transport in solar cells. Inspired by the development of perovskite and organic solar cells, organic hole-transport materials have been widely applied in Sb2Se3 solar cells, such as Spiro-OMeTAD,4 CZ-TA5 and PCDTBT.6 However, organic hole-transport materials often suffer from low hole mobility and poor device stability.7 To date, however, limited work has been reported on well-matched inorganic hole-transport materials for Sb2Se3-based solar cells. Solution processed hole-transport materials, PbS quantum dots8 and CuSCN9 have been applied in Sb2Se3 solar cells. The high efficiencies achieved with inorganic HTL based Sb2Se3 devices are around 7%. However, it is noted that HTLs involving toxic Pb are usually considered as potential problems in practical applications and the voltage-induced interfacial degradation observed between the CuSCN/Au layers would result in device efficiency degradation.10 Recently, the Mai group used trigonal selenium layers deposited by vacuum evaporation to construct an n–i–p FTO/SnO2/CdS/Sb2Se3/Se/Au device structure,11 where selenium was found to suppress the interfacial recombination.
In this work, we develop an eco-friendly hole-transport material MoS3 to build n–i–p structured Sb2Se3 solar cells. The MoS3 layer was prepared through spin-coating and subsequent thermal decomposition of aqueous (NH4)2MoS4 solution. Besides the formation of the MoS3 film, the thermal decomposition process also generates H2S that reacts with Sb2O3 impurities, converting it to antimony chalcogenide so that the interfacial properties between the absorber and the hole-transport layers are improved. As a result, the extraction and collection of carriers are significantly improved, leading to remarkably enhanced short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF), which help these cells achieve a high efficiency of 6.86%. Concomitantly, our study shows that MoS3 displays extraordinarily improved stability compared with conventional organic hole-transport materials.
MoS3 thin films were prepared by the thermal decomposition of (NH4)2MoS4 in an N2 atmosphere. The detailed thermal decomposition process was studied via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) performed in the range of 30–550 °C (Fig. 1a), where two thermal decomposition stages are observed. The first decomposition stage occurs at 140–200 °C, which leads to a weight loss of 34% at 200 °C and the product at this annealing temperature is MoS3 (reaction (1)). At a temperature above 350 °C, MoS3 is further decomposed to form MoS2 (reaction (2)), which induces further weight loss of 16%. This result is consistent with the literature report.12 X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization was done for the (NH4)2MoS4 precursor films deposited on the silicon substrate annealing at 150–300 °C. The XRD patterns in Fig. 1b present a broad peak centered at 14°, which is the typical diffraction peak of amorphous MoS3 and MoS2. Further identification was performed via XPS spectra (Fig. S1, ESI†) for two samples which were prepared by annealing (NH4)2MoS4 precursor films at 200 °C (film 1) and 420 °C (film 2). The S 2p XPS spectra of film 2 display only one S 2p3/2 peak at 162.5 eV, while that of film 1 show two S 2p3/2 peaks at 162.2 and 163.4 eV, well attributed to S2− and S2−2, respectively. Moreover, the fitted S2−/S2−2 peak ratio of film 1 was close to 2, agreeing well with the reported amorphous MoS3.13 We thus propose that reaction (1) leads to the formation of MoS3 at 200 °C. (NH4)2MoS4 → MoS3 + H2S + 2NH3(1) (2)

The Sb2Se3 thin film was deposited on the CdS-coated FTO (fluorine-doped tin oxide) substrate via a thermal evaporation approach and the MoS3 film was deposited on the Sb2Se3 layer by spin-coating the (NH4)2MoS4 precursor with a concentration of 20 mg mL−1 (the detailed fabrication process and the effect of (NH4)2MoS4 precursor concentration on the device photovoltaic performance are provided in the Experimental Section and Table S1 in ESI,† respectively). As a result, Sb2Se3 displays a uniform surface morphology with clear grain boundaries (Fig. 1c). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurement shows a surface roughness of 39.3 nm. Deposition of MoS3 could evenly cover the Sb2Se3 surface, as shown in Fig. 1d. The film surface becomes markedly flat and the average roughness decreased to 18.0 nm. The uniform surface coverage and the low surface roughness are desirable for the interfacial contract with the back electrode.
In order to explore the effect of the annealing temperature on the performance of the hole-transport layer, devices with the FTO/CdS/Sb2Se3/MoS3/Au structure were fabricated (Fig. 2a). The thicknesses of the CdS buffer layer, Sb2Se3 absorber layer and MoS3 layer were measured to be 60, 400, 30 nm, respectively (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2c presents the J–V curves of the best-performing Sb2Se3 solar cells based on MoS3 films with different annealing temperatures, which were measured under one Sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). The detailed device parameters are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). Specifically, in the absence of hole-transport layer, the devices exhibit an average PCE of 3.89%. With the MoS3 HTL annealed at 150 °C, the average PCE increased to 6.65%. All the photovoltaic parameters are essentially enhanced when compared with the device without a HTL, indicating the effectiveness of MoS3 in hole extraction and transport. The efficiency of the device increased slightly with the annealing temperature in the range of 150–200 °C. The best photovoltaic parameters (JSC = 29.5 mA cm2, VOC = 381 mV, FF = 61.1% and PCE = 6.86%) were achieved when the annealing temperature was 200 °C. Further increasing the annealing temperature over 200 °C leads to a gradually decreased device performance, and the PCE decreased to as low as 0.94% when annealing at 300 °C. The decrease in the device performance is most likely due to the interface diffusion between the Sb2Se3 and MoS3 layers at a high annealing temperature, which will introduce defects that bring forth carrier recombination. We conducted further device investigations with the optimized fabrication conditions. The histogram of the device performance measured on 50 separately prepared devices with and without HTLs is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The average efficiency of the devices without HTLs is 3.98%, while that of the devices with optimal HTLs is 6.70%, along with a reduced standard deviation. This result demonstrates that the MoS3 HTL could significantly increase the device efficiency and reproducibility. It is noted that the device reported in this work achieves top efficiency for planar Sb2Se3 solar cells prepared by thermal evaporation (see Table S3, ESI† for the list of the state-of-the-arts Sb2Se3 based devices with n–p and n–i–p structure).

To investigate the energy level arrangement between absorber layer Sb2Se3 and HTL MoS3, we applied ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) to measure the conduction band minimum (CBM), valence band maximum (VBM) and Fermi level (EF) of Sb2Se3 and MoS3 films (Fig. 2d and e). Combined with the band gaps estimated from the ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) absorption spectra of Sb2Se3 and MoS3 (Fig. S3, ESI†), the Fermi level, VBM, and CBM of Sb2Se3 are determined to be −4.50 eV, −5.08 eV, and −3.85 eV, respectively, while those of MoS3 are −4.15 eV, −4.95 eV, and −2.95 eV. The proposed band diagram of CdS/Sb2Se3/MoS3 is accordingly presented in Fig. 2f, which suggests that the dissociated electrons in Sb2Se3 could be blocked by the MoS3 layer because of the large CBM offset of MoS3, while the dissociated holes could be effectively extracted and transported to the MoS3 layer. Therefore, MoS3 is a suitable hole-transport material to form n–i–p structured Sb2Se3 solar cells.
It has been studied that Sb2Se3 films fabricated by physical deposition show Sb2O3 on the surface, which is considered as a detrimental impurity in solar cells that induces charge recombination.6 This is also true with our deposited Sb2Se3 film, where the binding energies at 538.5 and 540.0 eV by XPS characterization are ascribed to Sb 3d3/2 of Sb2Se3 and Sb2O3,14 respectively (Fig. 3a). Surface treatment with hydrochloric acid solution15 and (NH4)2S16 has preliminarily demonstrated the ability to remove the surface oxide impurities, while the treatments are accompanied by corrosion of the Sb2Se3 layer. For the (NH4)2MoS4 precursor solution, it shows weak acidity due to the hydrolysis of NH4+ ions that could alleviate the surface damage. Furthermore, the thermal decomposition generated H2S could react with Sb2O3 to form antimony sulfide. As shown in Fig. 3a, with the (NH4)2MoS4 precursor solution spin-coated on it, the Sb2Se3 film (ii-Sb2Se3) shows a significantly reduced peak intensity of Sb2O3 compared with the as prepared Sb2Se3 film (i-Sb2Se3), while the Sb2Se3 film with an annealed MoS3 film (iii-Sb2Se3) shows no obvious peaks at 540.0 eV, indicating the effective removal of Sb2O3 in the M-Sb2Se3 film.

In fact, XPS can only detect the surface composition, and the signal of Sb2O3 may also be covered by the post-deposited MoS3, instead of transforming to sulfide as described above. To draw a clear conclusion, we conducted Raman scattering characterization (Fig. 3b). The two main bands (190 cm−1 and 210 cm−1) matched well with the orthorhombic Sb2Se3 phase for the three Sb2Se3 films.15 However, the i-Sb2Se3 film showed an obvious Sb2O3 peak at 253 cm−1,17 while the peak intensity at 253 cm−1 was very weak in the ii-Sb2Se3 film. For the iii-Sb2Se3 film, the Sb2O3 peak at 250 cm−1 disappeared completely, accompanied by the appearance of new peaks at 377 and 403 cm−1 for MoS3.18 The result indicates that the fabrication process has a desirable effect on the removal of Sb2O3.
The introduction of the MoS3 hole-transport layer is expected to improve the photoexcited carrier collection. Therefore, external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 4a) were recorded to investigate the photo-response of the devices with and without HTLs. As the CdS electron transport layer and the interface between the CdS and Sb2Se3 layers are the same, the transport process for the photo-excited carriers near the CdS–Sb2Se3 heterojunction is almost unaffected. As a result, the improvement of quantum efficiency at short wavelengths (<550 nm) is insignificant. At longer wavelengths (550–1000 nm), the EQE spectra show a noticeable improved photoresponse for the device with an MoS3 HTL. This indicates that the photogenerated holes could transport through Sb2Se3 with a significantly reduced recombination, suggesting that the introduction of the MoS3 HTL can effectively extract the holes and thus reduce the charge recombination.

To further explore the mechanism by which the VOC and FF are enhanced, Mott–Schottky (C−2–V) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements in the dark were performed. The Vbi value is the point at which the linear part of the C−2–V curve is extrapolated to the X-axis. As seen from Fig. 4b, the Vbi values for the device without an HTL and the device with an MoS3 layer are 367 mV and 430 mV, respectively. Vbi is closely related to the VOC of the devices, so the slight increase in VOC is due to an increase in the device Vbi. The benign Sb2Se3/MoS3 junction interface with favorable energy level alignment reduces the Schottky barrier at the back contact, leading to a positive effect on the main p–n junction. Moreover, a wider depletion width Wd was calculated from the Mott–Schottky (C−2–V) measurements for the device with an MoS3 layer (device without HTL: 227 nm; device with MoS3:248 nm). The wider Wd could facilitate carrier generation in the p–n junction and hole extraction to the HTL with a reduced probability of being trapped and recombined during the transport process.
The EIS curve of the device without an HTL is well fitted with two shunt circuits (Fig. 4c and d), while that of the device with an MoS3 HTL could be fitted with one shunt circuit. The recombination resistance R2 (1349 Ω cm2) for the device with an MoS3 HTL is much larger than either of the recombination resistances R2 (330 Ω cm2) and R3 (235 Ω cm2) for the device without an HTL. As discussed above, the device with an MoS3 HTL would form a benign interface between Sb2Se3/MoS3 upon the effective removal of Sb2O3. The optimized interface could result in a reduction of carrier recombination for the improvement of FF.
Finally, MoS3 as an inorganic hole-transport material also effectively improves the stability of the device. As shown in Fig. S4a (ESI†), the efficiency of the unencapsulated device with an MoS3 HTL was maintained in an ambient environment for up to six months. Further tests under extreme conditions (70 ± 10 °C, 70% ± 10% relative humidity, in the dark) for the same device were carried out for one week. More than 85% of the initial efficiency of 6.78% was maintained after 160 hours for the device with an MoS3 HTL. However, Spiro-OMeTAD, an organic hole-transport layer material in Sb2Se3 solar cells, exhibited poor humidity and temperature stability. The device with the Spiro-OMeTAD HTL showed a 60% efficiency decrease after 160 hours. The degradation behavior of the device parameters (VOC, JSC and FF) is shown in Fig. S4b–d (ESI†). Clearly, there are significant decreases in all the three parameters in the Spiro-OMeTAD HTL based device under these extreme conditions when compared with the device based on the MoS3 HTL. The Spiro-OMeTAD doped with lithium salt is easy to be oxidised in air. This characteristic impairs the hole-transport ability and the device performance.
In summary, we have demonstrated that MoS3 could be applied as an efficient hole-transport layer in Sb2Se3 solar cells, and the corresponding power conversion efficiency reached 6.86%, which is compared with those in solar cells of this material using the best performing organic hole conductor Spiro-OMeTAD. MoS3 is an eco-friendly hole-transport material, and the aqueous solution process is facile and of low-cost. During material processing, we found that Sb2O3 on the surface of Sb2Se3 could be eliminated with the decomposition of precursor materials via the generation of H2S gas. Hence, this process is able to heal the defect induced by oxidation. Finally, MoS3 enables superior device stability against the humidity and the temperature. This work provides a promising candidate for inorganic hole-transport materials and presents an artful strategy for interface optimization in antimony chalcogenide solar cells.
