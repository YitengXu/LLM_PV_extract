    , Accepted 1st July 2020First published on 1st July 2020AbstractA new narrow bandgap non-fullerene electron acceptor was designed, synthesized, and characterized for near-infrared organic photovoltaics. This acceptor was compared to a structurally similar compound with systematically modified side chains, and a series of solar cells were fabricated, employing the common donor polymers PTB7-Th and PBDBT. The devices exhibited charge generation over a wide spectral range and power conversion efficiencies up to 8.1%. The non-geminate recombination dynamics were investigated and quantified via a combination of capacitance spectroscopy and transient open-circuit voltage decay measurements. The reduction of the bandgap results in increased bimolecular recombination losses, while solar cells composed of PBDBT were afflicted by stronger monomolecular, i.e. trap-assisted, recombination losses that ultimately caused the lower power conversion efficiencies of the respective devices. The latter observation could be correlated to less ordered blend film morphology.
1. Introduction
In recent years, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have received increasing attention owing to the potential of manufacturing large-area, flexible solar cells via mild and economically favorable solution-based processing techniques.1,2 The gains in performance recently observed for OPVs can mostly be attributed to the use of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) that were developed through continuous efforts to replace the hitherto ubiquitous fullerene-based acceptors.3,4 Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on fullerene acceptors in a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) configuration yield power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 11% for single-junction devices,5,6 while PCEs of over 17% have been reported for state-of-the-art, single-junction and tandem NFA-OSCs, placing them within reach of the performance range of perovskite solar cells.7–9 In addition to the increased performance, NFAs can be tuned to yield compounds that absorb at longer wavelengths (e.g., near-infrared).10,11 This control over the bandgap opens up the potential to develop semi-transparent OSCs that could find application in building-integrated photovoltaics and in agriculture.12,13 Even when considering the recent advances in NFAs, it is still necessary to develop a deeper understanding of loss mechanisms in NFAs such as non-radiative and non-geminate recombination – the process where free electrons and holes originating from different excitons recombine – to further improve the performance of OSCs.14–18 This is especially required since the interplay between narrow bandgap NFAs (Eg ≤ 1.3 eV) and polymers such as PTB7-Th or PBDBT, originally designed for fullerene acceptors,19,20 is yet not fully understood.21,22 Hence, this study focuses on four different narrow bandgap blend systems in solar cells, the observed photo-physical, morphological, and OPV performance differences, and how these differences relate to the non-geminate recombination dynamics.
2. Results and discussion
We recently reported narrow bandgap electron acceptors, namely CTIC-4F and COTIC-4F, which are characterized by optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of 1.3 and 1.1 eV, respectively.11,23 The molecules are designed based on an A–D′–D–D′–A molecular configuration, consisting of cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) as the central donor (D) unit, thienyl units as the flanked sub-donor (D′) fragments, and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile as the terminal acceptor (A) units. The molecular structures of CTIC-4F and COTIC-4F differ by their side chains on the D′ fragments, specifically alkyl vs. alkoxy groups for CTIC-4F vs. COTIC-4F. Changing the substituent of side chains on the thienyl fragments is an effective way to modulate the frontier orbital energy levels and absorption profiles of organic semiconductors.24,25 In this work, we designed a new NFA derivative, namely CETIC-4F (Fig. 1), containing an ester substituted group in the 3-position of the D′–thienyl unit (see Scheme S1 and Fig. S1–S4, ESI†). As evidenced by the optical transitions and the cyclic voltammetry, incorporating electron-withdrawing ester substituents into alkyl side chains lowers the HOMO level from −5.36 eV for CTIC-4F to −5.47 eV for CETIC-4F, while resulting in a minor effect on the optical bandgap (Fig. 1 and Fig. S7, ESI†). These experimental results were further confirmed by employing quantum chemical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). It was revealed that the side chains play an important role in the energy levels of the compounds; first, due to their different electron-donating properties and, second, due to the different backbone planarity of the studied compounds resulting from the alkoxy and ester groups in the side chains (Fig. S8 and S9, ESI†).

This underlines the potential of the aforementioned synthetic strategy to finely tune the NFAs for energy level matching, while maintaining a similar bandgap.
Organic solar cells were fabricated and optimized to investigate the photovoltaic performance of two donors and two NFAs, namely PBDBT and PTB7-Th19,20,26 as well as CETIC-4F and COTIC-4F (see ESI†).11,23 The same trend in performance can be observed for the two sets of devices with different donors, where of the investigated NFAs, CETIC-4F shows the highest PCE compared to COTIC-4F (see Fig. 2 and Table 1). Furthermore, the devices with PTB7-Th as the donor perform better than their PBDBT counterparts, owing to higher values of the short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF), while in contrast the open-circuit voltages (VOC) tend to be of a similar value. The COTIC-4F devices showed the biggest drop in PCE when changing the donor polymer, namely from up to 7.04% (PTB7-Th:COTIC-4F) to only 2.32% (PBDBT:COTIC-4F). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements reveal that PTB7-Th:CETIC-4F and PBDBT:CETIC-4F devices show charge carrier generation in the spectral range of 300–950 nm, while PTB7-Th:COTIC-4F and PBDBT:COTIC-4F devices exhibit charge generation at even longer wavelengths (300–1100 nm), which is in good agreement with the thin film absorption spectra and earlier reports (Fig. 1 and 2).11 Furthermore, the photocurrent density (Jph) was calculated, which is defined as follows: Jph = Jlight − Jdark,(1)where Jlight is the current density under illumination and Jdark is the current density in the dark (see Fig. S13–S15, ESI†). The photocurrent density can be compared between the different devices by plotting against the effective voltage Veff = V0–Vcor, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph = 0 (Fig. 2) and Vcor is the applied voltage corrected for the losses caused by the series resistance (Vcor = Vapp − J·Rseries).27,28 Similarly, the probability of charge collection PC is accessible from the ratio between the saturated photocurrent density Jph,sat with the values for Jph at different biases:29 (2)

As can be seen in Fig. S14 (ESI†), the PTB7-Th:CETIC-4F and PTB7-Th:COTIC-4F devices exhibit a better charge collection PC than their PBDBT counterparts. When the two NFAs are compared, PTB7-Th:CETIC-4F and PBDBT:CETIC-4F devices show a higher PC than PTB7-Th:COTIC-4F and PBDBT:COTIC-4F devices, respectively; this difference is subtle for the PTB7-Th devices, while significant for the PBDBT devices. Ultimately, a reasonable correlation between the collection probability PC and the device performance can be observed, where higher values for PC, specifically at forward bias around maximum-power conditions, go hand in hand with higher values for the solar cell PCEs. Additionally, J–V-curves at varying light intensities were measured to qualitatively inspect the non-geminate recombination mechanisms (Fig. S15, ESI†). The light intensities were decreased by neutral density filters. Commonly, the relationship between the JSC and the light intensity I follows a power law (JSC ∝ Iα), where the value of the exponent α indicates the presence of bimolecular recombination (α → 0.5) and/or space charge effects caused by differences in hole and electron mobility (α → 0.75). In the case of the studied blends similar values for the exponent (α ≈ 0.9) were determined.30,31 Indeed, the hole and electron mobility (μh,e) obtained via single-carrier diodes analyzed via the Mott-Gurney relationship show significant differences in the magnitude of the two types of mobility for all systems (μh/μe = 5–138, Fig. S18 and Table S2, ESI†). It is therefore likely that the deviation of the exponent α from unity is caused by the aforementioned space charge effect rather than by the influence of bimolecular recombination alone. The second common approach to investigate the types of non-geminate recombination mechanisms of solar cells is by determining the relationship between the VOC and the light intensity I:32,33 (3)where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature (T = 300 K), and q is the elementary charge.34 The VOC–ln(I)-plots exhibit a slope of S = 1kT/q for solar cells in the case of ideal, pure bimolecular recombination. However, the presence of bulk or surface traps can cause monomolecular recombination that lead to deviations of the slope (bulk traps: S > 1kT/q; surface traps: S < 1kT/q).22,35,36 The VOC–ln(I)-plots exhibit good linearity over the investigated light intensities and the slopes determined for the studied devices are in a range of S = 0.84–1.13kT/q. These results indicate that all types of non-geminate recombination should be taken into account as loss mechanisms.36 Hence, the light intensity dependent J–V-curves are not sufficient to paint a conclusive picture of the non-geminate recombination dynamics and a more in-depth analysis is necessary to obtain quantitative results.
The recombination dynamics in the studied solar cells were quantified via an analysis based on capacitance spectroscopy that allows the determination of the charge carrier density n (eqn (S3)–(S5), Fig. S19, ESI†Fig. 3a).37 The studied solar cells show charge carrier densities in a similar range, with the biggest divergence at forward bias approaching open-circuit conditions (highest for PTB7-Th:CETIC-4F: n = 5.2 × 1016 cm−3; lowest for PBDBT:CETIC-4F: n = 2.6 × 1016 cm−3). To obtain a quantitative understanding of the recombination mechanisms, it is assumed that the overall measured recombination current density (Jrec = Jph,sat − Jph) is a superposition of the three aforementioned recombination mechanisms that contribute a certain part to the total recombination current density Jrec: (4)where q is the elementary charge, L is the active layer thickness, τ is the charge carrier lifetime, n is the charge carrier density, and k is the recombination coefficient of the three different recombination mechanisms (bm: bimolecular; tb: bulk trap-assisted; ts: surface trap-assisted). By reconstructing the recombination current density Jrec obtained from the J–V-curves with the charge carrier density (n) and the effective mobility (μeff), which is explained in the ESI,† it is possible to quantify the recombination coefficients (k) (Fig. S20–S22, ESI†).22,38 In general, the PTB7-Th:COTIC-4F and PBDBT:COTIC-4F devices exhibit higher bimolecular recombination coefficients kbm than their CETIC-4F-based counterparts. Furthermore, the fitting yields higher contributions of bulk trap-assisted recombination in the PBDBT:CETIC-4F and PBDBT:COTIC-4F devices compared to the PTB7-Th:CETIC-4F and PTB7-Th:COTIC-4F solar cells, which could be the reason for the reduced performance of the PBDBT OSCs (Fig. S22, ESI†). In addition, the contributions of surface trap-assisted recombination are only relevant under open-circuit conditions for all tested devices and even under these conditions they do not dominate the non-geminate recombination dynamics (Fig. S21, ESI†).

Operating conditions of interest such as max-power, and short-circuit are highlighted for convenience. 
In a subsequent step, it is possible to calculate the charge carrier lifetime τrec by rearranging eqn (4), since the carrier density n and the relevant recombination coefficients (kbm, ktb, kts) are now known (Fig. 3b). However, it is necessary to also take the extraction dynamics of the investigated solar cells into account to obtain a complete picture, since non-geminate recombination and extraction are in a direct competition to each other (see eqn (S6)–(S8), ESI†).21,39 To this end, the effective extraction time τex can be defined as follows: (5)where q is the elementary charge, L is the active layer thickness, n is the charge carrier density, and J is the current density (Fig. 3b).38 Once the charge carrier lifetime and the extraction time are determined, it is possible to calculate the competition factor (θ = τex/τrec), a figure of merit introduced by Barthesaghi et al. in 2015.39 In this study, the bias-dependent competition factor θ is accessible, since the bias-dependent lifetime and extraction time were determined.38 In summary, a good reciprocal relationship between the competition factor θ and figures of merit for the device performance (FF, PCE) can be observed (Table 2), where lower θ values go hand in hand with a higher device performance.

In addition to the analysis based on capacitance spectroscopy, we also performed transient open-circuit voltage decay measurements on the solar cells as a secondary method to investigate the relevant non-geminate recombination processes (see eqn (S9)–(S14) and Fig. S23, ESI†). The VOC-transients depicted convey significant differences between the PTB7-Th and PBDBT devices (Fig. 4a). It takes up to one order of magnitude longer for the VOC to drop to half of its initial value for PTB7-Th:CETIC-4F and PTB7-Th:COTIC-4F devices (t1/2 = 0.6–1.2 ms), when compared to their PBDBT:CETIC-4F and PBDBT:COTIC-4F counterparts (t1/2 = 0.06–0.13 ms; Table 2), which is suggestive of higher recombination rates in the PBDBT devices. The carrier lifetime τrec and the recombination order β can be determined from the transients of the VOC for the relevant timescales not dominated by the shunt resistance limit (PTB7-Th devices: t < 10−3 s; PBDBT devices: t < 10−4 s, Fig. S23, ESI†). It is revealed that the highest recombination order βmax reached for the PTB7-Th:CETIC-4F and PTB7-Th:COTIC-4F devices (βmax ≈ 1.6) is larger than for the PBDBT:CETIC-4F and PBDBT:COTIC-4F devices (βmax ≈ 1.4) (eqn (S11)–(S14), Fig. S23, ESI,† and Table 2). Another interpretation of the recombination order β is as an indicator of the relative contribution to the effective recombination by bimolecular and/or monomolecular recombination.40 Therefore, higher values of βmax result either from an increased bimolecular contribution, a decreased trap-assisted (e.g. monomolecular) contribution, or a combination of both cases. To fully quantify the recombination, it is necessary to transform the measured VOC values to the transient charge carrier density nOC and plot the carrier lifetime τrec against it (Fig. 4b and c). Furthermore, it has to be stressed that bulk and surface trap-assisted recombination cannot be distinguished by this method.22 The analysis to obtain the transient carrier density nOC and the lifetime τ is described in detail in the ESI† (eqn (S11)–(S14)). In essence the carrier densities under open-circuit conditions determined via capacitance spectroscopy act as a reference point for the transformation of the transient VOC to the transient nOC values.11,22 Finally, it is possible to obtain values for the different recombination coefficients kbm and kt (bm: bimolecular; t: trap-assisted) by fitting the relevant parts of the measured charge carrier lifetime τ (i.e. at high levels of excitation). All studied devices exhibit some bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination, which is evidenced by the respective recombination coefficients (Table 2).22 In general, PTB7-Th:COTIC-4F and PBDBT:COTIC-4F devices exhibit the highest bimolecular recombination coefficients (kbm ≈ 2.0 × 10−11 cm3 s−1), while PTB7-Th:CETIC-4F and PBDBT:CETIC-4F devices show values in a smaller range (kbm ≈ (0.6–1.4) × 10−11 cm3 s−1). The magnitude of kbm is inversely proportional to the bandgap of the studied blend system, which correlates with the results obtained via capacitance spectroscopy and is in agreement with what would be expected from the fundamental relationships governing bimolecular recombination.41 In the case of trap-assisted recombination, PBDBT:CETIC-4F and PBDBT:COTIC-4F devices show nearly two orders of magnitude higher values for the relevant recombination coefficient (kt ≈ 105 s−1), than the respective PTB7-Th:NFA OSCs (kt ≈ 103 s−1).

The investigation of the morphology suggests that the order in the blend films could be responsible for the differences in trap-assisted recombination and ultimately performance that were observed for devices with the two studied donor materials. In particular, the PBDBT:CETIC-4F and PBDBT:COTIC-4F blends show less order in comparison to the PTB7-Th:CETIC-4F and PTB7-Th:COTIC-4F blends, as evidenced by GIWAXS and AFM measurements (Fig. S24 and S25, ESI†). The roughness in the AFM measurements is consistently higher for PBDBT:CETIC-4F and PBDBT:COTIC-4F blends than for the PTB7-Th:CETIC-4F and PTB7-Th:COTIC-4F blends. GIWAXS measurements show that there are diffraction peaks from the donor and the acceptor component in the PTB7-Th:CETIC-4F and PTB7-Th:COTIC-4F blends, while the scattering from PBDBT:CETIC-4F and PBDBT:COTIC-4F blends is dominated by the polymer. The difference in film composition (60% NFA in PTB7-Th blends and 50% NFA in PBDBT blends) is not likely to account for such a dramatic difference. This suggests that the NFA domain is significantly less ordered in blends with PBDBT than with PTB7-Th.
Our results show that the difference in trap-assisted recombination is related to whether PTB7-Th or PBDBT is being used as the donor component of the blend, whereas the difference in bimolecular recombination is related to the magnitude of the bandgap.
Future studies may focus on elucidating how the side chains influence the crystallinity, phonon coupling, and the resulting photophysical recombination processes. A combination of theoretical calculations and experiments such as advanced X-ray scattering, Raman spectroscopy and neutron scattering would be necessary to uncover these underlying mechanisms.
3. Conclusion
In conclusion, the synthesis and characterization of the new NFA CETIC-4F is described and it was shown that altering the sub-donor (D′) fragments is a viable strategy to finely tune the energy levels. The performance of solar cells based on the common polymer donors PTB7-Th and PBDBT, as well as the systematically structurally modified NFAs CETIC-4F and COTIC-4F are investigated. The solar cells exhibited charge generation at wide spectral ranges (300–950 nm), reaching wavelengths as long as 1100 nm in the case of PBDBT:COTIC-4F and PTB7-Th:COTIC-4F. The PCEs achieved for PTB7-Th:CETIC-4F and PTB7-Th:COTIC-4F devices (8%, and 7%, respectively) were consistently higher than for devices employing PBDBT:CETIC-4F and PBDBT:COTIC-4F (6%, and 2%, respectively). This observation could be linked to considerably higher monomolecular, i.e., bulk trap-assisted recombination losses for the PBDBT:CETIC-4F and PBDBT:COTIC-4F devices that were determined via analyses based on capacitance spectroscopy and open-circuit voltage decay measurements. AFM and GIWAXS results indicate that the PBDBT:NFA blend films show higher roughness and less order in contrast to the PTB7-Th:NFA blends, which likely cause the increased trap-assisted recombination. Furthermore, PTB7-Th:COTIC-4F and PBDBT:COTIC-4F devices exhibited higher bimolecular recombination coefficients than their PTB7-Th:CETIC-4F and PBDBT:CETIC-4F counterparts, which is in agreement with what would be expected from the fundamental, inverse relationship between the bandgap and bimolecular recombination.
