    , Accepted 31st March 2014First published on 1st April 2014AbstractCu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin film, a highly promising and low-cost absorber layer material for solar cells, has been in situ fabricated on stainless steel and FTO glass substrates for the first time, using a one-step solvothermal treatment of CuZnSn-alloyed film with sulphur or selenium powder. The resulting products were characterized by X-ray diffractometry (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy. Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize and confirm the formation of CZTS. The effects of temperature, reaction time, the ratio of Cu/Zn/Sn, and non-elemental reactants on the formation of CZTS nanocrystal films were assessed, and we found that the reaction temperature was a key factor in determining the properties of the final products. Pure CZTS phase forms at a temperature of 250 °C or higher. Our method produces CZTS thin films at 250 °C, the lowest reaction temperature that can be used in the process and the lowest temperature of any current fabrication system. We also found that flexible substrates promote the growth of CZTS nanocrystals. Using flexible substrates in the in situ fabrication of nanocrystalline thin films may make it possible to use CZTS for industrial applications.
Introduction
Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) is regarded as one of the best absorber materials for sustainable and efficient solar cells, especially when it is compared to traditional, silicon-based solar cell materials. Currently, the maximum efficiency of the best CIGS thin-film solar cell is around 20%,1–4 but it is expensive to produce because the gallium and indium used in the active layer are both rare and costly (indium and gallium comprise 0.05 ppm or less of the earth's crust).5 This means that the large-scale production of CIGS solar cells is not cost effective. CIGS also uses toxic elements like Cd and Se, which can lead to environmental problems.
Alternative materials are expected to overcome these problems, and Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) could be the ideal alternative for use in low-cost absorber layers. CZTS is a I2–II–IV–VI4 quaternary compound semiconductor, and substitutes sulfur for the selenium, and zinc and tin for the indium, in the CIS ternary compound. All the elements used in CZTS are abundant in the earth's crust (Cu: 50 ppm, Zn: 75 ppm, Sn: 2.2 ppm, S: 260 ppm)5 and their toxicity is extremely low. CZTS has a direct band gap energy of 1.0–1.5 eV and a large absorption coefficient of over 104 cm−1, which is similar to CIGS.6–10 According to the photon balance calculations of Shockley–Queisser, CZTS has a theoretical efficiency of 32.2%,11 so using CZTS films in the absorber layers of solar cells presents excellent industrial possibilities.
During the past several years, interest in the design and preparation of CZTS has increased significantly because of its special crystal structure. Physical vapor and chemical deposition methods are widely used in the preparation of CZTS powders. The physical vapor method relies heavily on the use of a vacuum atmosphere, which may result in relatively low material utilization and difficulties with large-scale production.12 The chemical deposition method involves the sulfurization of electrochemically deposited metal precursors,13 and sol–gel spin-coated deposition.14 These methods produce CZTS films that often contain unidentified impurities and need high-temperature annealing. Chemical deposition was developed to process large-area substrates in high throughput situations and results in high material utilization. For example, Todorov et al. fabricated CZTS thin film solar cells with a 9.6% power conversion efficiency (PCE) using a hydrazine-based hybrid slurry approach.15,16 Unfortunately, hydrazine is a highly toxic and very unstable compound that requires extremely careful handling and storage. This limits the applications of the method.
We developed a non-toxic, mild, ethanol-based way to fabricate dense CZTS and CZTSe thin films as absorber layers for photovoltaic applications, using a one-step solvothermal treatment of the CuSnZn alloy layer (or layered elemental Cu/Sn/Zn) plus sulfur/selenium powder in the presence of absolute ethanol. Our new method has several advantages. First, CZTS and CZTSe thin films can be fabricated directly onto both flexible and rigid substrates on a large scale, and the thickness of the films can be well controlled. Second, the synthesizing temperature of about 250 °C is the lowest possible temperature that will form pure-phase CZTS and CZTSe thin films. Third, absolute alcohol is the only solvent that will not harm the environment. The CZTS thin films prepared using our new method produce low-cost, high-efficiency, roll-to-roll flexible photovoltaic cells.
Experimental section
Sample preparation
All reagents were analytically pure and were used as received without further purification. The substrates were successively cleaned in ultrasound baths of acetone/deionized water/isopropanol. This step ended with the substrate being dried in air at 60 °C for 1 h. The CuSnZn alloy layer was deposited in an Ar atmosphere with an operating pressure of 7 × 10−3 mbar. The alloy targets were applied using the stoichiometric ratio of Cu:Zn:Sn = 2:1:1, which resulted in a target purity of 99.99%. In situ monitoring of the thickness of the layer was performed by a film thickness monitor that uses a quartz crystal. The substrate with the alloy layer was put into a 25 mL PLL-lined autoclave that contained 15 mL absolute alcohol. The autoclave was sealed and run at 230–270 °C for different lengths of time, then cooled to room temperature naturally. The metallic precursor thickness was 400 nm and the amount of S powder (or Se powder) was 0.01 g. The product was washed several times with absolute ethanol and then dried at room temperature for characterization.
Characterization
X-ray diffractometry (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance) was used to characterize the structure of the sample using nickel-filtered Cu-Kα radiation at 40 kV voltage and 40 mA current. All the XRD measurements were performed within 20° ≤ 2θ ≤ 60°. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S-4800 and Zeiss-EVO LS-15) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Vecco Digital Instruments, Nanoscope IIId) were used to characterize the morphology of the product. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns and the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were captured by a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope. Raman spectra were obtained under a 532 nm laser (Renishawin Via Raman Microscope Raman system). The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of the as-prepared products were recorded on a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer.
Results and discussion
Formation of the CZTS nanoflake thin films
Although much previous work has described the growth of CZTS powders, only a few papers have focused on the direct fabrication of CZTS thin films. In the present study, CZTS nanoflake thin films were fabricated in situ on both flexible and rigid substrates using a mild and facile wet-chemical process. The formation of CZTS nanoflake thin films on FTO is a good example of how to use a rigid substrate in this process.
To understand how the reaction paths of our system affect the formation of pure CZTS, we first investigated the influence of the synthesis temperature on the formation of CZTS nanocrystals. The X-ray diffraction patterns and the corresponding Raman spectra of the as-prepared samples prepared at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. The X-ray diffraction pattern of the S230 sample indicated that pure CZTS could not be obtained at 230 °C, because of the presence of binary Cu2−xS and SnS2 at 46.5° (JCPDS no. 2-1292) and 49.9° (JCPDS no. 40-1467). When the temperature was increased to 240 °C or higher, pure CZTS crystals formed (curves S240 and S250). The diffraction patterns of samples obtained at 240 °C and 250 °C could be indexed to the pure kesterite phase of Cu2ZnSnS4, with three characteristic peaks at 28.5°, 47.3°, and 56.2° (JCPDS no. 26-575), which were assigned to diffraction of the (112), (220) and (312) planes. Actually, from the above XRD results, we could only estimate that 240 °C is the lowest temperature at which pure CZTS crystals will form in our solvothermal system, because ZnS and Cu2SnS3 have very similar XRD patterns to kesterite-type CZTS. We needed another analytical method to confirm the presence of the pure CZTS phase.

Raman spectroscopy is commonly used to characterize material structures. The analysis of thin film materials using XRD techniques is more difficult if the film material doesn't have good crystallinity. When Raman spectroscopy was used to test the microcrystalline group effect of chalcogenide compounds, the presence of SnS (with characteristic modes at 160 cm−1, 190 cm−1, 220 cm−1) and SnS2 (with modes at 315 cm−1) was reported by Parkin et al.17 The major peaks at 475 cm−1, 304 cm−1 and 356 cm−1 corresponded to Cu2−xS,18 Sn2S3,17 and ZnS.19 The major peaks at 318 cm−1, 348 cm−1, and 295 cm−1 corresponded to Cu3SnS4.4
Raman techniques have recently been used by a number of researchers to confirm the formation of pure CZTS. There have been many reports on the Raman peak positions of CZTS, which include a typical peak at 333 cm−1 and a weak shoulder at 284 cm−1.4 Raman peaks at 338–339 cm−1, 288 cm−1, and 256–257 cm−1 were reported by P. A. Fernandes,2 and peaks at 286 cm−1, 328 cm−1, and 367 cm−1 were reported by H. Katagiri.22 Other researchers have found CZTS Raman peaks at ∼252 cm−1, ∼287 cm−1, ∼338 cm−1, ∼351 cm−1, and ∼368 cm−1, with the strongest peak at ∼338 cm−1.20,21 The migration phenomenon associated with these peaks was produced because CZTS exists within a small stoichiometric range. There is no official or standard assignment of active Raman peaks for CZTS films at the current time.
We examined all prepared samples by Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 1b shows the Raman spectra for samples S230, S240, and S250 with 532 nm laser excitation. The characteristic peak we found at 335 cm−1 from the curve of S250 matches the results of previous research,4 and indicated the presence of pure CZTS nanocrystals. No other characteristic peaks of impurities were observed. The Raman signals of CZTS (335 cm−1) and Cu2−xS (475 cm−1) were both detected in the curve for S230 (Fig. 1b). The peak intensity of Cu2−xS decreased while the peak intensity of CZTS increased with the increasing temperature (S240), which indicated that higher temperatures assist in the hydrothermal reaction, and promote the change of the binary and ternary components to the CZTS phase.
From the XRD and Raman results, we concluded that 250 °C is the lowest temperature for forming pure CZTS crystals in our solvothermal system. The CZTS crystals that formed at 230 °C had impurities, and XRD could not detect CZTS because of their inferior crystallinity. When the temperature increased, the crystallinity improved and more CZTS was found. The complicated reaction process is not discussed here.

Fig. 2a and b show the typical SEM images of the as-prepared CZTS films obtained at 250 °C for 6 h and 18 h, respectively. The CZTS films were composed of plenty of nanoflakes perpendicular to the surface of the FTO glass substrate. There was a clear hierarchy of thicker flakes at the top that transitioned to thinner flakes at the bottom, with an average thickness of ∼20 nm. As the reaction time extended, relatively dense nanoflakes were formed (Fig. 2b). Fig. 2c displays the TEM image of an individual CZTS nanoflake obtained after an ultrasonic dispersal treatment of the CZTS sample. It shows the fractured surface of the broken CZTS nanoflake. A high-resolution transmission electron microscopy image of the nanoflake, taken from square frame 1 (Fig. 2c), is shown in Fig. 2d. Square frame 2 shows superposed nanoflakes. In square frame 1, we can clearly see the lattice fringes, with an interplanar spacing of 1.9013 Å, that can be assigned to the (220) plane of CZTS. These results indicate that individual nanoflakes are single-crystalline.

We hypothesized that, since the reaction of elemental sulfur with copper is faster than the reaction of tin with zinc, the copper ions combine with the sulfide ions and make CuS on the surface of the crystal along the preferential direction (Scheme 1a). This produces copper vacancies.23,24 The tin and zinc ions enter the internal structure of the crystal and occupy the spaces left by the departed copper (Scheme 1b). The growth of sheet-like CZTS crystals relies heavily on the crystal structure of the CuS nanoflakes. They eventually cover the nanoflake film completely (Scheme 1c). The schematic diagram of the formation mechanism of CZTS thin films on the substrates, with sulphur powder, is shown in Scheme 1.

The influence of the substrate on the crystallization of CZTS
Stainless steel materials were used in our research because they are dependably flexible and can be used in cost-effective, large-scale industrial applications. Researchers have synthesized CZTS on rigid substrates in many different ways, but few people have studied the fabrication of CZTS on flexible substrates. We tried to use rigid substrate methods to synthesize CZTS crystals directly onto stainless steel flexible substrates so the results would be useful for industrial applications. Fig. 3 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the as-prepared products, obtained at various reaction temperatures, on the stainless steel substrates. The X-ray diffraction patterns only showed the presence of the stainless steel substrate in the curve for S230 (Fig. 3a). No CZTS peaks were detected. However, the existence of Cu2−xS was confirmed by the presence of a Raman peak at 475 cm−1 in the curve for S230 (Fig. 3b), indicating that at 230 °C the only as-prepared product on the stainless steel was the binary phase Cu2−xS. At 230 °C on the FTO substrate, however, the binary phase (Cu2−xS) and the quaternary phase (CZTS) were both formed. When the temperature increased to 240 °C, the Raman signals of CZTS and Cu2−xS were both detected on stainless steel (S240). The characteristic peaks of CZTS at 287 and 332 cm−1 in the S250 curve were consistent with the data in the literature,4 indicating the presence of CZTS nanocrystals.

When we compared the CZTS growth process on FTO substrates and stainless steel substrates, we found that CZTS nanocrystals formed more easily on the FTO substrates than on the stainless steel substrates under the same reaction conditions. We inferred that the surface morphology caused by magnetron sputtering may influence the growth of the CZTS nanocrystals. Images of the surface morphologies of the as-prepared CuZnSn alloy films were captured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 4a and b show the two-dimensional AFM images of a CuZnSn alloy film deposited by magnetron sputtering onto stainless steel and FTO glass substrates, respectively. The grains of the CuZnSn alloy nanoparticles on FTO were high in density, and had an average size of 80–150 nm (Fig. 4b), but the surface morphology of the CuZnSn alloy film on a stainless steel substrate was irregular. This large difference in the initial morphology of the CuZnSn grains may affect the reaction kinetics for the formation of CZTS on different substrates. The exact mechanism needs further investigation.

The influence of composition on the crystallization of CZTS on FTO substrates
A uniform alloy layer was easily obtained using alloy targets during magnetron sputtering, but it was difficult to tune the ratio of the metal elements and study the effect of composition on the formation of CZTS films. The layer-by-layer sputtering method was used to control the ratio of various elements. Sn, Cu and Zn were successively sputtered onto the FTO substrates. The purity of all the target materials was 99.99%. Individual thicknesses were estimated using the density and molecular weight of each element. Trimetallic CuSnZn films, with Cu/Sn/Zn ratios of 2:1:1, 1.5:1:1 and 1:1:1, were formed and then reacted with S powder to prepare CZTS. Fig. 5 shows the Raman spectroscopy results of the CZTS films obtained at 250 °C for 18 h on FTO substrates, in which the main CZTS peak shifts from 331 cm−1 to 335 cm−1 as the proportion of the copper reagent increases. The XRD patterns in Fig. 1 and the Raman spectra in Fig. 3 show copper combining with S powder to form copper sulfide (Cu2−xS), and tin and zinc ions entering the internal crystal to occupy the copper vacancies and form CZTS. The proportion of copper was a critical factor in the synthesis of CZTS, and the increased Cu content in the original metal film induced crystal structure variations in the final CZTS films, which led to a Raman peak shift. This Raman shift may be related to d-spacing or compressive stress in the sprayed films.20

Influence of non-elemental reactants on the crystallization of CZTS(Se)
Se and S are elements of the same family and have similar natures, so we attempted to synthesize a CZTSe film with CZTS methods, using Se powder instead of S powder. The effects of temperature and time on crystal growth were studied using Raman spectroscopy. The effect of the reaction temperature on CZTSe formation was investigated by fixing the thickness of the CuZnSn film (400 nm) and the reaction time (18 h and 24 h). Fig. 6 shows the Raman spectra of the CZTSe nanocrystals obtained at various reaction temperatures on stainless steel substrates. The Raman spectra revealed the presence of CuxSey (260 cm−1) and CZTSe (196, 172 cm−1) at 230 °C. When the reaction temperature increased, we found that the peak intensity of CuxSey at 260 cm−1 diminished, but the peak intensity of CZTSe at 196 cm−1 increased considerably. The peaks of CuxSey disappeared when the temperature increased to 270 °C. We hypothesized that the pure CZTSe crystal may form at 270 °C because the higher reaction temperature made the reaction more favourable.
 Fig. 6  Raman spectra of the CZTSe nanocrystalline thin film samples prepared for 18 h on stainless steel substrates. The reaction temperatures were 230 °C, 240 °C, 250 °C, and 270 °C. 
The effect of the reaction time was also tested. Fig. 7 shows the Raman spectra of the CZTSe nanocrystals obtained after preparation at 250 °C on stainless steel substrates for different reaction times. Raman spectra derived from the CZTSe formed over 24 h shows typical peaks at 196 and 172 cm−1 without evidence of CuxSey Raman signals. We compared it to the CZTSe film obtained after 18 h and concluded that a longer reaction time promotes the growth of pure CZTSe under hydrothermal conditions, and changing the hydrothermal reaction temperature and reaction time is an effective way to fabricate high yield CZTSe films without impurities.

Optical properties of the as-prepared CZTS nanoflake thin films

Fig. 8 shows the absorption spectra of the CZTS nanoflake thin films prepared at 250 °C for 18 h. The films have a wide absorption wavelength range, from visible light (400 nm) to near the infrared region (1100 nm). Due to direct forbidden reactions, the absorption characteristics of the as-prepared sample obey the model equation (αhυ)2 = A(hυ − Eg), where α is the optical absorption coefficient, h the Planck constant, ν the photon frequency, A a constant, and Eg the energy gap. The extrapolated value (the straight line to the x-axis) of hν at 0 gives the absorption band gap Eg corresponding to 1.45 eV (inset of Fig. 8). The calculated band gap of the CZTS nanoflake thin films is in agreement with the reported values of 1.0–1.5 eV.25–27 The UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra and the corresponding (αhν)2vs. hν curve of the CZTS thin films prepared at different temperatures and for different times are shown in Fig. S6 and S7.† We found that the absorption edge of the sample prepared at 230 °C and 240 °C was shifted to a shorter wavelength, compared with the sample prepared at 250 °C. This phenomenon can be explained by absorption by Cu2−xS or SnS2 at 230 °C and 240 °C. The results correspond to the previous XRD and Raman data. Also, the reaction time is an important factor in the synthesis of CZTS thin films. The absorption edge of the as-prepared CZTS thin film prepared for 6 h was shifted to a shorter wavelength, which is ascribed to absorption by Cu2−xS. The differences in the absorption curves of the samples prepared for 18 h and 24 h were not obvious. This phenomenon is consistent with the previous results.

Conclusions
In conclusion, CZTS nanocrystal thin film absorber layers have been successfully fabricated in situ on both flexible stainless steel and rigid FTO substrates using a non-toxic, mild, and solvothermal process. The thickness of the films was well controlled. The effects of the synthetic conditions, such as the reaction temperature, reaction time, substrates and composition of metal films, on the morphology and crystalline phase of CZTS were discussed systematically, and the reaction temperature was found to play a critical role in the formation of the final products. When we used the method we developed, we discovered that the pure CZTS phase could only be obtained at temperatures of 250 °C or higher, the lowest temperature of any reported current fabrication system. Our fabrication system also costs less, covered more area, and was more environmentally friendly than the other known methods. It provides a low temperature way to prepare CZTS thin films for photovoltaic applications, and its use of flexible substrates will make the large-scale industrial applications of CZTS thin films possible.
