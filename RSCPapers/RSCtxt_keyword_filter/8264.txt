    , Accepted 11th October 2011First published on 21st October 2011AbstractA novel donor–π-spacer–acceptor type organic dye (AK01) bearing a phenylenevinylene-conjugated system and a derivative of indoline donor was synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cells. AK01 showed panchromatic TiO2 sensitization with high overall conversion efficiency of 6.2% under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2).

Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have a significant potential to be used as low-cost devices for conventional p–n junction solar cells.1 Most of current research concerns development of panchromatic sensitizers that can absorb visible light of all colors for nanocrystalline oxide semiconductor solar cells. The molecular design of the panchromatic sensitizer is a challenging task as several requirements have to be fulfilled by the dye which are very difficult to be met simultaneously.2,3 Towards this goal, metal free organic dyes have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their high molar extinction coefficients, flexible structural modifications and low costs.4 In general, most efficient organic dyes are composed of three units such as a donor and acceptor bridged by a π-conjugation linker (D–π–A). However, the appropriate design of these three units in a sensitizer is still very critical.5 Moreover, organic dyes have several disadvantages such as relatively narrow absorption bands, higher aggregation on semiconductor surface and lower operational stability compared to metal based panchromatic sensitizers. For developing new sensitizers in the IR sensitive region, we have modified the molecular structure of organic dyes by changing one of these three parts systematically via molecular engineering, and investigated the contribution of every different part of the dye to overall DSCs performances.
Recently, Kim et al. reported an organic sensitizer, TA-St-CA, containing triphenylamine as the electron donor, cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor moiety and a π-conjugated oligo-phenylenevinylene unit linker with power conversion efficiency up to 9%.6 However, the onset of the IPCE spectrum of TA-St-CA was limited to below 700 nm due to a large E0–0 energy gap of 2.25 eV. Our previous study shows that a minimal driving force of 0.2 eV is sufficient for an efficient dye to ensure fast excited-state injection and regeneration of the oxidized dye.7 Alternately, a minimum ground-state oxidation potential, S+/0, of −5.4 eV and a maximum excited-state oxidation potential, S+/*, of −4.0 eV resulting in an energy E0–0 gap of 1.4 eV are sufficient for an efficient dye. The Ru-based panchromatic sensitizer (black dye), which has an E0–0 energy gap of 1.6 eV, shows the highest conversion efficiency of 11.1%.8 However, most of the efficient organic dyes have an E0–0 energy gap of >2.0 eV. Therefore, there is still much room to tune the HOMO–LUMO energy level to increase the long wavelength absorption, achieve a high extinction coefficient, and shift the energy levels to improve the performance of the solar cell. To achieve this we have selected here an indoline derivative as a donor as it has been used in organic sensitizers for strong and intense absorption bands in the visible region.9 In addition, this unit has a tendency to prevent π-stacked aggregation on the semiconductor surface.10 Here, we report the design, synthesis and characterization of a new organic sensitizer, AK01, containing an indoline derivative as the electron donor, cyanoacrylic acid as the acceptor moiety and a π-conjugated oligo-phenylenevinylene unit linker together with its DSCs performances and also compare it with that of TA-St-CA as shown in Fig. 1. Syntheses of dyes AK01 and TA-St-CA in detail are described in the ESI (Scheme 1, ESI†).

AK01 shows a broad absorption spectrum covering a wide range of the visible region with a superior light-harvesting efficiency to TA-St-CA (Fig. 2). Low-lying absorption bands, which can reasonably be assigned to the π–π* transition, are exhibited for AK01 at 440 nm with a molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 3.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1, and for TA-St-CA, at 412 nm with ε of 3.1 × 104 M−1 cm−1. The absorption maximum of AK01 was 0.19 eV low energy shifted compared to that of TA-St-CA due to the substitution of triphenylamine with indoline derivatives which have stronger donor ability than triphenylamine. When absorbed on a transparent thin TiO2 film, AK01 and TA-St-CA show broad absorption spectra similar to that in solution, while the absorption peak is slightly blue-shifted due to the interaction between the carboxylate group and TiO2 (Fig. 2). Upon adsorption on the TiO2 film, the tail of the absorption spectrum of AK01 extended up to 650 nm, which is red shifted to about 100 nm compared to that of TA-St-CA. This broadening of the absorption spectrum is desirable for harvesting the solar spectrum and leads to a large photocurrent.

To obtain an insight into the electron distribution of AK01 and TA-St-CA, we performed theoretical calculations at the DFT level using B3LYP functional and the double-zeta basis set 6-31+G(d,p) (ESI†). The HOMO of AK01 that is largely delocalized on the indoline unit may facilitate reduction of the oxidized dye through reaction with I−, making it suitable for highly efficient solar cells. The LUMO is mainly the π* cyanoacrylic unit and has sizable contributions from the carboxylic groups, facilitating electron injection from the photoexcited sensitizer to the TiO2 semiconductor. As shown in Fig. 3, the calculated HOMO and LUMO energy gap for AK01 and TA-St-CA are 2.39 eV and 2.46 eV, respectively, indicating that AK01 has better light harvesting efficiency compared to that of TA-St-CA. The calculated electronic absorption spectra of AK-01 and TA-St-CA (Fig. S5, ESI†) show a similar trend regardig experimental absorption spectra (Fig. 2).

The ionization potential (IP) of AK01 and TA-St-CA bound to the nanocrystalline TiO2 film was determined by using the photoemission yield spectrometer (Riken Keiki, AC-3E) (Fig. S6, ESI†). Ground-state oxidation potential, S+/0, values of −5.56 eV and −5.76 eV were obtained for sensitizers AK01 and TA-St-CA, respectively. The HOMO energy level of AK01 is positive shifted to about 0.20 eV compared to that of TA-St-CA due to the stronger donor ability of indoline derivatives than triphenylamine. The S+/0 energy levels of both AK01 and TA-St-CA were sufficiently low compared to the redox potential of I−/I3− (−5.20 eV)11 for efficient regeneration of oxidized dye through reaction with iodide. The onset of the optical energy gap (E0–0) of AK01 was approximately 2.03 eV.12 The excited-state oxidation potential, S+/*, of sensitizer AK01 was estimated to −3.53 eV which lies above the conduction band edge (−4.2 eV)1 of the nanocrystalline TiO2 (Table S3, ESI†). Therefore, an excited-state injection into the conduction band of TiO2 is expected to occur with sensitizer AK01.
A double-layer TiO2 photoelectrode (10 + 5) μm in thickness with a 10 μm thick nanoporous layer and a 5 μm thick scattering layer (area: 0.25 cm2) was prepared by screen printing on a conducting glass substrate.2 A dye solution of AK01 and TA-St-CA with 3 × 10−4 M concentration in acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol (1/1, v/v) was used to uptake the dye onto the TiO2 film. Deoxycholic acid (DCA) (20 mM) as a co-adsorbent was added into the dye solution to prevent aggregation of the dye molecules. The TiO2 films were immersed into the dye solution and then kept at 25 °C for 30 h. Photovoltaic measurements were performed in a sandwich type solar cell in conjunction with an electrolyte consisting of a solution of 0.6 M dimethylpropyl-imidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile (AN). The dye-deposited TiO2 film and a platinum-coated conducting glass were separated by a Surlyn spacer (40 μm thick) and sealed by heating the polymer frame. Photocurrent density–voltage (I–V) of sealed solar cells was measured under AM 1.5G simulated solar light at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 with a metal mask of 0.25 cm2. The photovoltaic parameters, i.e. short circuit current (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (η), were estimated from I–V characteristics under illumination. The AK01 sensitized solar cell showed higher power conversion efficiency than TA-St-CA, with Jsc of 15.4 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.64 V, FF of 0.63, and corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 6.20%. Under the same conditions, TA-St-CA showed a Jsc of 10.1 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.718 V, FF of 0.746, and an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 5.41% (Fig. S7 and Table S4, ESI†). AK01 showed higher Jsc than TA-St-CA. The improved photocurrent of AK01 relative to TA-St-CA is in good accord with the proceeding IPCE measurements. Fig. 4 shows the monochromatic incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for DSCs based on AK01 and TA-St-CA. AK01 shows excellent sensitization of nanocrystalline TiO2 from 350 to 625 nm with a maximum value of 86% in the plateau region. Taking into account the reflection and absorption losses by the conducting glass, the photon to current conversion efficiency in this range reaches about 95%. The infrared IPCEs of AK01 are high in comparison with that of TA-St-CA. The onset of the IPCE spectra of AK01 is close to 800 nm and red-shifted to 100 nm compared with that of TA-St-CA. As shown in Fig. 2, the newly developed AK01 exhibits more superior light harvesting efficiency than TA-St-CA and is consistent with the action spectra of the AK01 and TA-St-CA. Here the integrated Jsc values from IPCE were matchable with the obtained values (15.4 mA cm−2 for AK01 and 10.1 mA cm−2 for TA-St-CA) from the I–V measurement. To understand the dye aggregation effect on the photovoltaic performance of DSCs, we investigated the photovoltaic properties of AK01 with and without DCA addition in the dye bath. The IPCE value of 86% in the plateau region observed in the absence of DCA, decreased up to 74% with the addition of DCA during the dye-loading process (Fig. S8, ESI†), indicates a self-assembly property of AK01. As shown above, the design of the new D–π–A dye by the introduction of an indoline moiety remarkably improves the performance of the DSCs.

In conclusion, we designed and synthesized a new D–π–A sensitizer, AK01, with indoline as an electron donor, cyanoacrylic acid as an acceptor moiety and a π-conjugated oligo-phenylenevinylene unit linker for panchromatic TiO2 sensitization. The photovoltaic properties of AK01 show enhanced light harvesting ability, suppressed dye aggregation, and consequently resulted in a high overall conversion efficiency of 6.2%. Our results strongly indicate that the application of organic dye as a panchromatic sensitizer in DSCs is promising. Work on further broadening the absorption spectra for enhancing the light harvesting ability in the infrared region through molecular and energy-level engineering of metal-free organic dyes is under study.
