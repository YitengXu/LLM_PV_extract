    , Accepted 30th August 2018First published on 30th August 2018AbstractThe recent development of the Internet of Things and related sensor technologies has greatly impacted logistics tracking, structural health monitoring, environmental analysis, and data extraction. It is highly imperative to develop a technology to allow the sensor node to operate independently, sustainably, and in a maintenance-free way by harvesting energy from the ambient environment. Here we demonstrate a triboelectric device as a highly efficient and durable kinetic energy harvester from ubiquitous mechanical vibrations. We construct a cylinder coated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and place a number of metal balls inside the cylinder. This ball-based triboelectric generator (B-TEG) converts the mechanical shaking into electricity. By grounding the metal-freestanding-layer, we form a new configuration (B-GTEG). The output power of B-GTEG shows an 8 fold improvement through the electrophorus effect compared with B-TEG, providing the potential for supplying sustainable power to wireless sensor nodes.
1. Introduction
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are widely used in logistics data logging,1 construction health and safety monitoring,2 environmental status monitoring,3 and healthcare monitoring.4 With the limited lifetime of batteries, the power source has become a big barrier for the further implementation of WSNs. Exploiting sustainable power sources from the ambient environment is the ideal and most demanding challenge for future industries. Energy harvesting devices convert ambient energy sources, such as solar light,5 mechanical vibrations,6,7 heat8etc., into electricity.
Solar cells are a well-developed mature technology for harvesting ambient light and supplying electricity. However, they cannot supply electrical power in environments without light exposure, which greatly restricts its potential applications. When sensor nodes are embedded in dark and inaccessible locations, they require sustainable power sources. For example, containers in logistics are typically placed inside trucks and vessels. They lack solar light but experience many mechanical vibrations during transportation. It is important to develop enabling technologies that can harvest kinetic energy to supply power to sensor nodes (inside containers), which are located away from solar light. Among all energy sources, mechanical vibration exists ubiquitously in various environments, such as vibrations of machines, human movement, the flow of water, and wind.9–13 Piezoelectric and triboelectric harvesters can convert mechanical motion into electricity.14–16
Triboelectric nanogenerators have attracted significant attention in recent years because of their simple structure and broad material selection. When a metal and a dielectric material make contact with each other, electrons transfer from the metal to the dielectric material. The surface of the dielectric material is negatively charged, and the metal surface is positively charged.17,18 By connecting two materials with a conductor, high voltage electricity is produced because of contact electrification and electrostatic induction.19 There are different types of triboelectric generator, including sliding mode,16,20–23 contact mode,15,20,24–30 single-electrode mode31–33 and freestanding mode.34,35 To enhance the energy conversion efficiency, Chun et al. boosted the output power by 16 times via the electric double layer effect in a configuration of a three-layer system.14 Kim et al. designed a powder-based triboelectric nanogenerator, where a rigid acrylic cylinder contains PTFE powder confined between two aluminium metal plates.36 Triboelectric nanogenerators based on pressing and sliding structures cover a wide range of mechanical vibrations. In this work, we design and construct a so-called ball-based triboelectric generator (B-TEG) to harvest shaking motion and convert it to electricity. To effectively harvest the shaking motion, we place metal balls inside a cylinder covered with PTFE. This structure enables us to have one more terminal in the middle with metal balls for charge exchange.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the schematic diagram of the ball-based triboelectric generator (B-TEG). The paper cylinder has a height of 3 cm and an inner diameter of 3 cm. The surface of this cylinder is coated with PTFE using double sided tape. Al metal balls with a diameter of 1 mm are placed inside the cylinder. The top and bottom surfaces of the PTFE cylinder are coated with Cu thin films as the top and bottom electrodes. Fig. 1(b) and (c) show the top-view and side-view photos of the B-TEG structure.

This B-TEG operates in a freestanding mode, in which the Al metal balls serve as a freestanding metal layer and the PTFE cylinder works as the counter triboelectric material. Fig. S1 in the ESI† and Fig. 2 illustrate the working mechanism of the ball-based triboelectric generator (B-TEG). In the 1st cycle, as the cylinder with Al balls undergoes mechanical shaking, the Al balls inside make contact (Fig. S1(a)†) with the surface of the bottom PTFE and then separate (Fig. 2(a)) from it. The electrons in the Al balls are attracted to the PTFE because of the triboelectric effect.37 Thus, the Al balls carry positive charges and PTFE carries negative charges. The positively charged Al balls bring about electrostatic induction to the electrodes near the PTFE. The bottom electrode becomes negatively charged.38 The charges flow through the external circuit and form a current (Fig. 2(b)). Then the Al balls move upward and make contact with the surface of the top PTFE (Fig. 2(c)). Similar to the case where the Al balls are in contact with the bottom PTFE surface, the contact and separation processes generate negative charges on the top Cu electrode, where the direction of current flow is reversed (Fig. 2(d)). In the whole cycle, the mechanical shaking generates alternating current (AC) in the external circuit of the B-TEG structure, which can be converted to a DC current via a rectifier.

(b) Separation from the bottom surface: Al balls move upwards and leave the bottom inner surface of the PTFE cylinder. (c) Contact with the top surface: Al balls make contact with the top inner surface of the PTFE cylinder. (d) Separation from the top surface: Al balls move downwards and leave the top inner surface of the PTFE cylinder. 
We use a linear motor (PS-01-37 × 120-C, LinMot) to provide a mechanical shaking of 1 N force and 3 Hz frequency to the B-TEG. The B-TEG is filled with the Al balls with a volume ratio of 50% and a ball diameter of 1 mm. Fig. 3(a) shows the two-dimensional schematic diagram of the B-TEG, and the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current (ISC) of the B-TEG under an external drive are shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c). The B-TEG shows a high VOC of 26 V, and a high ISC of 1.1 μA. We extract the peak power with different load resistors ranging from 1 Ω to 1000 MΩ, as shown in Fig. 3(d). The peak power is 22.05 μW with the use of a 500 MΩ load resistor.

We investigate the effect of the volume ratio of Al balls on the output performance of B-TEG. Fig. 3(e) shows the VOC and ISC of the B-TEG as a function of the volume ratio of the Al balls, from 20% to 80%. When the volume ratio is increased from 20% to 40%, the VOC and ISC are increased from 21.3 V to 27.0 V and from 0.364 μA to 0.557 μA respectively; meanwhile the VOC and ISC of B-TEG are decreased when the volume ratio of Al balls is over 40%. With the increase of the volume ratio of Al balls, on one hand, a greater contact force will act on the PTFE, which increases the contact area between the Al balls and PTFE; on the other hand, the increase of the volume ratio of Al balls decreases the distance between the electrodes and Al balls. The electrode, separated from the Al balls, induces negative charge due to the short distance between the electrode and the Al balls. The electric potential between the two electrodes drops. These two competing factors result in an optimum point. Thus, the output increases with the volume ratio of the Al balls, but decreases after obtaining the maximum output at a volume ratio of 40%.
We also change the ball diameter from 1 mm to 4 mm. Fig. 3(f) shows that the highest output is obtained using the ball with a diameter of 3 mm. The increase of the ball diameter increases the mass of the Al balls. The Al balls with a low mass have a chance to stick on the inner surface of the PTFE cylinder by electrostatic force. The stuck Al balls form a protective wall against the contact of PTFE with other Al balls, and the output voltage and current drop. This problem can be solved using high mass Al balls. On the other hand, the contact area depends on the gap between the Al balls. There is a larger gap between the Al balls with the increase of ball diameter. Thus, the output of the B-TEG increases with the diameter of the balls, while it decreases after it reaches the maximum output with a ball diameter of 3 mm. In the rest of the experiments, we use mechanical shaking of 1 N force and 3 Hz frequency, an Al ball volume ratio of 50% and a ball diameter of 1 mm as a reference to compare with other structures.
In the B-TEG structure, the Al balls inside the container are generated with abundant charges from the triboelectric effect during the shaking motion. But it lacks an effective way to collect the generated charges. To boost the output, we provide one more terminal in the middle of the container, where a metal tape is wrapped around the middle of the inner surface of the container and connected to the ground, as shown schematically in Fig. S2 in the ESI.† The metal tape is a bridge to allow the charge exchange between the Al balls and the ground during the shaking motion. The charge in the Al balls can be extracted by the ground connection for an additional output in this structure. Therefore, a new configuration of the grounded-metal-freestanding-layer triboelectric generator (B-GTEG) is designed and created to collect the abundant charges of the Al balls generated during the mechanical shaking, based on Volta’s electrophorus.

Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the schematics of B-TEG and B-GTEG. The B-TEG has only one single output (Load A). However, the B-GTEG has 2 outputs (Loads A and B) because we provide one more terminal of metal tape. We take Cu metal tape with a width of 5 mm to place in the middle of the cylinder as the additional terminal. The working mechanism of B-GTEG is described schematically in Fig. S3 and S4 in the ESI.† It is similar to that of B-TEG. The major difference is that the charges in the Al balls are allowed to flow to the ground or go back to the Al balls by the electrophorus effect. When the Al balls approach the PTFE, the positive charges and negative charges in the Al balls are separated due to the electrostatic induction of negatively charged PTFE. After the ground connection to the middle terminal of the B-GTEG structure, the Al balls make contact with this middle terminal, allowing the negative charges in the Al balls to flow to the ground. Thus, the Al balls become positively charged. This so-called electrophorus effect has been widely used to generate electricity. Fig. 4(c) shows the peak power of B-TEG and B-GTEG. Load A of B-GTEG shows a much higher power of 127.449 μW compared with that of B-TEG (22.05 μW). The total output power of B-GTEG (Load A + Load B) is 178.525 μW. There is an 8-fold output power enhancement. The grounded connection in the middle terminal is needed for the electrophorus effect to increase the output current and voltage. The electrophorus effect is used to produce more electrostatic charges in the Al balls by electrostatic induction.

We also calculate the average power Pavg using this formula:39 (1)where R represents the load resistance, I is the corresponding current, and T is the period of the current waveform. The average power of Load A of B-GTEG also shows a higher output power of 9.9282 μW compared with that of B-TEG (5.93621 μW). The total average power of B-GTEG (Load A + Load B) is 13.14874 μW. B-GTEG still has a 2 times output power enhancement in average power.
As the positive charges in the Al balls are reduced after connecting to the ground, it is easier for the Al balls to lose their electrons to the PTFE during the shaking motion. The surface of the PTFE becomes more negative. This makes the potential difference between the top and bottom electrodes increase. On the other hand, the electrophorus effect can be used to describe the flow of charges in the terminal of the metal tape. During the shaking motion, the Al balls make contact with and separate from the inner surface of the PTFE cylinder. When the Al balls are approaching the inner surface of the PTFE cylinder, positive charges can be induced to the Al balls because of the negative charges on the PTFE surfaces. We can extract more charges from the terminal of the metal tape by the electrophorus effect. Thus, the total output power can be enhanced.
We also study the effects of the materials and the widths of the middle metal tape on the output performance. For Load A, the output current of B-TEG without metal tape is 0.5 μA. After connecting the Al or Cu metal tape in the middle part of the cylinder, the output current of B-GTEG is increased to around 0.9 μA. The structures with grounded metal tapes have a higher output current, as shown in Fig. 4(d). The ground connection of the metal tape is required for the electrophorus effect to extract electrons from the Al balls. The output currents of the B-GTEG structure with grounded Al metal tape and Cu metal tape are 1.25 μA and 1.55 μA, respectively. From the table of the triboelectric series, Al has a greater tendency to lose electrons than Cu. The Al balls become more positively charged and have a higher output current after the contact of the Al balls and the Cu tape.
By increasing the width of the metal tape from 5 mm to 30 mm, the output currents are reduced to 1.45 μA (10 mm) and 1.09 μA (30 mm), respectively, as shown in Fig. 4(e). The increase of the width of the metal tape reduces the contact area of the inner surface of the PTFE cylinder as well as the accumulated charge in the Al balls. As a result, the output power is reduced with the increase of the width of the metal tape. The same result is also shown in Load B, as shown in Fig. 4(f). Therefore, the optimized output current can be generated using grounded Cu metal tape.
To verify the effect of the metal tape, we also tried to wrap around the middle of the outer surface of the container with Cu metal tape. However, the output current with outer metal tape is smaller than that without metal tape, as shown in Fig. 4(e) and (f). The electrophorus effect does not work without a direct ground connection to the Al balls. This proves that the metal tape must be connected to the Al balls directly to boost the output current.
The increase in current of B-GTEG is used to compare with other boosting methods for TENGs as shown in Table 1. The use of a grounded-metal-freestanding-layer in B-GTEG has the highest percentage change of current and the output current increases 4 times. The other boosting methods using hybrid modes, molecular surface functionalization, nanopatterns and ionized-air injections also demonstrate a significant increase in current. A triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and an electromagnetic induction generator (EMIG) are integrated into one structure.40 There is an additional output current generated by the EMIG. The output current increases 37.5% compared with a single TENG. Molecular surface functionalization is also used to boost the output of TENGs.41 The amine (–NH2) functional group is put onto an Au film to increase the tendency to lose electrons. It has a 105.56% current increase in the TENG. Nanopatterns are usually used on the materials of the TENG to increase the contact area of the materials for boosting the output current. A nanomesh42 and a pyramid-featured nanopattern43 are created on the materials. These result in a 154.55% and a 288.89% current increase in the TENG respectively. The surface charge density limits the output current of the TENG. The maximum surface charge density of a dielectric material can be achieved by the injection of ions with an air ionization gun.44 The output current is increased by 333.33% after the maximum surface charge density is achieved. However, they cannot achieve a four-fold increase. The method of using a grounded-metal-freestanding-layer is provided as the cheapest and most effective method to boost the output current of a triboelectric generator.

The ambient mechanical vibration is usually intermittent and unpredictable. It is important to store the harvested energy in an energy storage device. To harvest the mechanical energy for powering a sensor node, we use a 100 μF capacitor to test the performance of B-TEG and B-GTEG. Fig. 5(a) and (b) show the circuit configurations of B-TEG and B-GTEG for charging a capacitor using different numbers of rectifiers. Capacitor charging curves of different configurations of B-TEG in 100 s are shown in Fig. 5(c). B-GTEG has a better performance and it can charge up the capacitor to 0.86 V in 100 s. B-TEG can only charge up the capacitor to 0.49 V in 100 s. Fig. 5(d) shows that B-GTEG can light up 100 LEDs.

3. Methods
3.1. Fabrication of copper thin film electrodes on a piece of dielectric material
PTFE (PTFE, Huasheng) with 1 mm thickness was used as the dielectric material. To prepare a coated PTFE sample, an air gun was used to remove the dust. The cleared PTFE was put into a MRC sputter system with the vacuum at 6 millitorr. The copper was sputtered on the PTFE under a 20 sccm Ar flow-rate and 70 W power for 15 min. The thickness of the copper layer is around 70 nm on one side of the PTFE, used as the top and bottom layers.
3.2. Fabrication of the triboelectric generator
A piece of PTFE was bent into a cylinder which had a 30 mm diameter and a 30 mm height. The copper tape with a 5 mm width was stuck around the inner surface of the PTFE cylinder in the middle position. The bottom layer, which was a piece of 3.6 cm × 3.6 cm PTFE with a copper coating, was used to cover one of the sides of the cylinder. Different numbers of 1 mm Al metal balls were put into the cylinder before it was sealed with another piece of PTFE with a copper coating.
3.3. Characterization and measurements
A linear motor (PS-01-37 × 120-C, LinMot), which was operated with a cycle of cosine curve and 154 ms at rest, was used to create a 3 Hz and 1 N shaking motion for the triboelectric generator. The period of the cosine curve was 179.3 ms and the peak to peak value was 30 mm. A 600 MHz oscilloscope (WaveSurfer 62Xs, LeCroy) and a low-noise current preamplifier (Model SR570, Stanford Research Systems, Inc.) were used for electrical measurements.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we design and construct a freestanding ball-based triboelectric generator and create a grounded-metal-freestanding-layer. Cu tape is used as the bridge to connect the Al balls to the ground. The B-GTEG can boost the output power through the Cu–Al interaction and the electrophorus effect. The output power is increased from 22.05 μW (B-TEG) to 178.525 μW (B-GTEG). There is an 8-fold output power enhancement. A grounded-metal-freestanding-layer is an easy way to boost a freestanding triboelectric generator. Our work provides great advantages over conventional power boosting methods for triboelectric generators.
