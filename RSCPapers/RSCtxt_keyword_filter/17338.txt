    AbstractThe bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) active layer, prepared by a spin-coating process, has been extensively investigated for its large donor–acceptor interfacial contact area, which can result in increased photo-current density. It is known that a concentration graded structure would enhance not only the charge generation but also charge transport, but, it is very difficult to exhibit such structure in BHJ system. The reason is that the morphology of the BHJ originates from self organization during the thermal annealing step. In this paper, polymer based photovoltaic (PV) devices with concentration graded bilayers have been successfully fabricated for the first time by solution process with various composition controlled poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acidmethyl ester (PCBM) mixtures. The concentration profiles have been confirmed by Auger electron spectroscopy. The optimized bilayer devices with uniform morphology show enhanced photocurrent density and power conversion efficiency when compared to those exhibited by BHJ based PV devices.
Introduction
Photovoltaic (PV) devices based on thin films made from conjugated polymers and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acidmethyl ester (PCBM) have been extensively investigated due to the advantages they offer: easy solution processability and positive potential applicability.1–13 There are great positive aspect of polymer based PV devices, such as allowing the realization of large area devices, lowering the low-cost processes due to solution spin casting, and allowing the creation of a flexible device with soft polymer properties.14–16 Moreover, a roll-to-roll process enabling fabrication of ITO-free polymer solar cells on flexible substrates has been realized from the inverted device geometry.17–19 When the PV devices are composed of an electron donor and acceptor in a bilayer active structure, the device operated well even though the performance showed low efficiency of 1% of the level achieved in early 1985.20 In the mechanisms of bilayer based PV devices, due to the short exciton diffusion length (typically 1∼10 nm scale), most of the created charge carriers may be recombined or trapped in the active layer before the charge separation and transportation to each electrode.21,22 Therefore, the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) concept which has an organized efficient interpenetrating donor–acceptor structure, has been introduced to overcome this low charge carrier mobility and recombination, resulting in an increase of the photocurrent density of polymer based PV devices.7,23–25
Until now, PV devices with bilayer active films showed low power conversion efficiency because most of the charge generation and separation was carried out only at the interface between the two layers with different electron and hole affinities. However, since the separated electrons and holes can be easily transported to each electrode with a lower possibility of electron and hole recombination, a bilayer device could be more effective compared to the BHJ as far as the charge transporting ability is concerned. Generally, it is difficult to fabricate a solution-processable well-organized bilayer device with P3HT and PCBM because the pre-coated P3HT bottom layer can be destroyed or dissolved when the PCBM top layer from the organic solvent is spin-coated. Therefore, the printing transfer technique or the thermal evaporation method was adapted to fabricate the different P3HT/PCBM compositional bilayer in the active layer.26,27
Recently, our group reported on solution processed polymer based PV devices with concentration graded bilayers with P3HT from chlorobenzene (CB)/PCBM from dichloromethane (DCM) solvent. It was found that a bilayer P3HT/PCBM device can be successfully prepared because the DCM solvent did not destroy the P3HT bottom layer.28 To give an overview of the BHJ research area, the P3HT/PCBM ratio controlled BHJ device has been widely studied because it enhances the device performance.29,30 For example, the Dyakonov group reported that the fill factor of BHJ polymer based PV devices is strongly dependant on the PCBM loading, because optimizing the composition plays an important role in active film morphology.31
In this study, it is demonstrated that solution processable polymer based PV devices with concentration graded bilayers can be fabricated via composition control of P3HT and PCBM in each layer for preparing devices with the optimized composition of the P3HT-rich bottom and PCBM-rich top layers. Even though DCM solvent will not destroy the P3HT bottom layer during the spin-coating process (∼30 s), a small amount of P3HT will still be dissolved in the DCM solvent if we increase the processing temperature or dissolution time. These unique characteristics of the DCM solvent can make it possible to prepare a P3HT/PCBM mixture top layer. During the spin-coating process, a concentration graded intermixed zone can be generated between the P3HT-rich bottom layer and the PCBM-rich upper layer because the DCM solvent can swell the P3HT-rich bottom layer, as was found in our previous study.28 The bilayer polymer PV devices prepared from an optimized composition of P3HT-rich and PCBM-rich regions with the created concentration graded intermixed zone showed greatly enhanced power conversion efficiency compared with that of single layer BHJ devices.
Experimental
Polymer based PV devices having a P3HT/PCBM blend bilayer with a concentration gradient via composition control were prepared by using the following method of which the layer structure is shown in Fig. 1(a).

(b) Band gap diagram of the P3HT-rich/PCBM-rich composition controlled bilayer structures. (c) FIB (Focused Ion Beam) 54° tilted images of the device's inner structure of P3HT-rich/PCBM-rich composition controlled bilayer structures with PEDOT:PSS-coated on ITO glass. 
First, ITO glass was cleaned by chloroform, acetone and isopropanol solvents to remove residual organic impurities. Then, the glass was treated with oxygen plasma for ten minutes to reform the ITO surface. A conducting polymer that is well known for its hole transporting material and its buffer layer, poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Baytron P), was spin-coated to a thickness of ∼35 nm. The PEDOT:PSS coated ITO glass was baked using a digitally-controlled hotplate at 200 °C for five minutes. For reference, the device with the BHJ structure, which consists of P3HT and PCBM at a blend ratio of (4 wt%) 1:0.6, was spin-coated at 900 rpm for five seconds in a glove-box from CB solvent. The total thickness of the active layer was 220 nm, found from the Alpha-step. The controlled cells with bilayer active layer structures were composed of a 110 nm-thick P3HT-rich bottom layer with the P3HT and PCBM composition of 7:3, 8:2, 9:1 from CB solvent by spin coating process. Then, the 110 nm-thick PCBM-rich top layer with the P3HT and PCBM composition of 3:7, 2:8, 1:9 from DCM solvent was also spin-coated on the P3HT-rich bottom layer. To confirm the co-solvent effects, the PCBM-rich top layer from co-solvent (CB and DCM) was spin-coated on the P3HT-rich region bottom layer from 100% CB solvent. Subsequently, an Al metal electrode was thermally deposited with a 150 nm thickness under a pressure of 1.3 × 10−6 torr. All the processes were then subjected to a thermal annealing process in the glove-box by directly placing the fabricated devices on a digital controllable hotplate at 150 °C for 30 min. The area of the active device with the deposited Al electrode was confirmed by video-microscope system (SOMETECH, SV-35) to be in the range 4–6 mm2.
The J–V curves were measured at AM 1.5 illumination with a Keithley 2400 source measure unit. A 1000 W xenon lamp (Oriel, 91193) was used as light source for the devices and its intensity was calibrated by a silicon reference cell (Fraunhofer ISE, certificate no. C-ISE269). The surface morphology and the roughness of the composition controlled bilayer films were observed by using atomic force microscope (AFM) made by Veeco (U.S.A) (non-contact tapping mode, D3100). The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured with a 300 W xenon lamp (Newport) and a monochromator (Model, Newport cornerstone 260) as a function of excitation wavelength (nm).
Results and discussion
Polymer based PV devices having P3HT-rich/PCBM-rich bilayers with a concentration gradient can be seen in Fig. 1(a). The proposed active bilayer device shows an intermixed region due to the different solubilities between the PCBM-rich top layer and the P3HT-rich bottom layer in the DCM solvent.28Fig. 1(b) illustrates the band position diagram of the controlled bilayer device with the P3HT-rich and PCBM-rich region. Charge generation and separation in the concentration graded bilayer may also occur similarly as in the BHJ active layer device because the P3HT/PCBM interface distribute everywhere in the bulk of the active layer. Then the electrons and holes in the active layer will be naturally separated and transported to each electrode, following the fluent pathway of P3HT and PCBM's HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital)–LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) level by the driving force of chemical potential.25 Due to the graded HOMO and LUMO energy position in the bilayer structure, the electrons and holes can be efficiently extracted. The FIB (focused ion beam) was utilized to confirm the device's inner structure of the controlled bilayers as shown in Fig. 1(c). The FIB images of the device's 54° tilted inner structure showed P3HT-rich (light region)/PCBM-rich (dark region) active layer on the PEDOT:PSS-coated ITO glass and Al metal electrode depending on color, light and shade.

The BHJ cell exhibits an efficiency of 2.53% while the bilayer device with 100% P3HT and 100% PCBM shows a slightly higher efficiency of 2.64%. In recent years, optimization of P3HT/PCBM composition has been found to be a powerful factor in deciding the active layer's morphology for charge transport properties of BHJ based PV devices.31,32 Additionally, the P3HT/PCBM composition affects the electron or hole carrier mobility.33,34 From previous experiences, we thought that the composition controlled bilayer structures could also act in an important role in determining the device performance. Fig. 2 indicates the device performance with P3HT-rich/PCBM-rich composition controlled bilayer structures. As can be seen in Table 1, the PCBM-rich region (P3HT/PCBM composition of 3:7) of the top layer from the DCM solvent spin-coated on the P3HT-rich region (P3HT/PCBM composition of 7:3) of the bottom layer from CB solvent was only 0.4%.

This poor performance can be explained as a result of the PCBM-rich top layer (P3HT/PCBM composition of 3:7) from the DCM solvent, which had a lot of aggregated un-dissolved P3HT nano-particles that are observed in the SEM image shown in Fig. 3(b). The AFM images seen in Figure S1(a) and (b) also confirm it. The DCM can dissolve the PCBM very well as shown in Fig. 3(a) but not for P3HT.

While the device performance was 1.95%, in case of the PCBM-rich region (P3HT/PCBM composition of 2:8) of the top layer from the DCM solvent spin-coated on the P3HT-rich region (P3HT/PCBM composition of 8:2) of the bottom layer from the CB solvent due to improved Jsc. And fill factor values are also enhanced with better morphology than the previous system (P3HT/PCBM composition of 3:7) shown in Fig. 3(c) and the AFM images of Fig. S1(c) and (d) (ESI†). In the PCBM-rich case (P3HT/PCBM composition of 1:9) of the top layer from DCM solvent spin-coated on the P3HT-rich region (P3HT/PCBM composition of 9:1) of the bottom layer from CB solvent, the device performance increased up to 2.85% with a clear morphology in the PCBM-rich top layer, as shown in Fig. 3(d) and the AFM images of Fig. S1(e) and (f) (ESI†). The Jsc was the most critical factor to determine the performance of the composition controlled bilayer device. From these results, it can be concluded that the device performance with the bilayer active layer is critical depending upon the P3HT/PCBM composition. The 1:9 composition of the top layer is apparently best among three cases but it is too early to say that it is optimum, since the device performance is strongly dependent on the film morphology.
To improve the film morphology of the top PCBM rich layer, a DCM/CB mixture solvent can be used. In the case of the spin-coated active layer with the P3HT/PCBM composition of 7:3, 8:2 and 9:1 for the bottom layer, as shown in Table 2, the active layer thickness was 173 nm, 182 nm, and 176 nm, respectively.

To investigate the film stability of the bottom layer from the casting of the top layer due to the used solvent, first, pure DCM solvent was spin-coated on each case of the composition controlled P3HT/PCBM layer. The film thickness of the bottom layer was not influenced by the DCM solvent, resulting in thicknesses of 171 nm, 176 nm, and 167 nm, respectively. On the other hand, the 5% added CB in DCM co-solvent system of the PCBM-rich top layer slightly affected the P3HT-rich bottom layer from 182 nm to 169 nm, about a 7% thickness reduction. The 20% and 30% added CB in DCM co-solvent systems seriously deteriorated the P3HT-rich bottom layer from 182 nm to 113 nm and 30 nm, 38% and 84% thickness reductions, respectively (see the supporting Fig. S2 of the surface profile data and the AFM images of Fig. S3, ESI†). Therefore, the 5% added CB in DCM co-solvent systems was chosen in the following experiments to obtain a more effective film morphology of the PCBM-rich top layer.

Fig. 4 shows the J–V curves of devices with the PCBM-rich region (P3HT/PCBM composition of 3:7, 2:8, and 1:9) of the top layer from the DCM/CB co-solvent spin-coated on the P3HT-rich (P3HT/PCBM composition of 7:3, 8:2, and 9:1) bottom layer. Even though the film morphologies prepared from the co-solvent system are greatly improved, as shown in Fig. 5(a)–(f), compared to Fig. S1 (ESI†), all the devices prepared from the 5% CB in the DCM solvent show worse performances than those of the devices prepared from the DCM only solvent.

(e), (f) The PCBM-rich top layer with P3HT/PCBM composition of 1:9 from 5% CB in DCM solvent (4 wt%). 
From these results, we can conclude that the CB and DCM co-solvent systems for the PCBM-rich top layer may have some negative effect on polymer based PV devices with composition controlled bilayers.
In order to confirm whether composition controlled bilayer devices have a concentration graded intermixed region, depth profiles of the active films between the P3HT-rich bottom layer from CB solvent and the PCBM-rich top layer from the DCM solvent were analyzed by recording the –S– (sulfur) concentration in combination with ion-beam milling depending on the thickness of the films as measured by Auger electron spectroscopy. Accordingly, PCBM has no sulfur elements that cannot be detected while P3HT is composed of sulfur contents (see the inset of Fig. 6).

Fig. 6 shows the peak-to-peak Auger signal of the PCBM-rich region (P3HT/PCBM composition of 2:8) of the top layer from the DCM solvent spin-coated on the P3HT-rich region (P3HT/PCBM composition of 8:2) of the bottom layer from CB solvent as a function of the depth of the bilayer. The sulfur signal (–S–) intensity was definitely low at the surface of the PCBM-rich top layer, whereas the bilayer active film with 8:2 P3HT-rich/2:8 PCBM-rich represented a sharply increased –S– signal from the 130 nm region of the PCBM-rich top point and was saturated at a point 180 nm from the top surface. This result suggests that the concentration graded intermixed zone of the P3HT-rich/PCBM-rich bilayer was generated during the spin coating process due to the solvent swelling effect.28 While increasing the PCBM composition in the bottom layer, the location of the intermixed zone was shown to be far from the top layer because the DCM solvent had high interpenetration into the bottom layer. Since the PCBM is well dissolved in the DCM solvent, the PCBM composition of the bottom layer is the key factor to determine the location of the intermixed zone with the concentration gradient (see supporting data of Fig. S4, ESI†).

Fig. 7 shows the incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves of devices with BHJ and bilayer of the PCBM-rich top layer (P3HT/PCBM composition of 1:9) from the DCM solvent spin-coated on the P3HT-rich bottom layer (P3HT/PCBM composition of 9:1). As summarized in Table 1, the BHJ device showed an efficiency of 2.53% with an 8.54 mA cm−2 photo-current density which leads to 55% IPCE depending on the wavelength (nm). In the case of the bilayer device with 9:1 P3HT-rich/1:9 PCBM-rich, the efficiency and the photo-current density were increased to 2.85% and 10.39 mA cm−2, which are related to an IPCE of over 68%. From these results, it can be said that the P3HT-rich/PCBM-rich intermixed zone with concentration gradient plays a meaningful role in the bilayer active layer in PV devices. Thus, the bilayer device from an optimized P3HT/PCBM composition with concentration gradient would initiate more in-depth study of multi-layer polymer based PV devices, and these would offer an alternative for more efficient device along with a single BHJ device.

Conclusions
It has been demonstrated that composition controlled P3HT-rich/PCBM-rich bilayer structured polymer-based PV devices with a concentration graded intermixed zone can be successfully fabricated by a solution process. Polymer PV devices with an optimized P3HT/PCBM composition controlled bilayer that have a concentration gradient showed an obviously better Jsc, resulting in high performance and IPCE compared to devices with a single BHJ. Additionally, a co-solvent is introduced in order to obtain better bilayer film morphology. It was found out that not only the P3HT/PCBM composition but also the film morphology play an important role in the optimization of device performance. The simple introduction to the solution-processable bilayer device will stimulate in-depth research into efficient multi-layer polymer based PV devices.
