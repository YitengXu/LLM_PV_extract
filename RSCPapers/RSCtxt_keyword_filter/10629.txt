In situ fabrication of an ordered macroporous perovskite semitransparent film on a FTO glass was successfully achieved via sacrificial polystyrene (PS) microsphere templates. The average visible transmittance of active layer from 20% to 45% can be tuned by simply changing the PS diameters and precursor concentrations. The ordered macroporous perovskite films show enhanced crystallinity and reduced recombination defects, superior to the island perovskite film. Transient photovoltage, transient photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectra measurements proved the advanced charge transport and reduced recombination by importing macroporous structures. Herein, the optimized 400 nm MP CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film with a high AL AVT of 36.5% achieved an impressive PCE of 11.7% compared to the island-like perovskite film (champion PCE = 5.6%), presenting a great potential for building integrated photovoltaic applications.
Introduction
Organometal trihalide perovskite solar cell (PSC) has been proved the most promising photovoltaic contender due to the intriguing photoactive attributes of CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) such as wide spectrum absorption range,1 high extinction coefficient,2 and long electron–hole diffusion length.3 To date, striking revolution of power conversion efficiency (PCE) for PSC has already increased from 3.8%4 to 22.1%.5 The rapid improvement of highly efficient PSCs has substantially stimulated their further applications in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV)6–9 and tandem cells10–12 whose prerequisite is the fabrication of semitransparent (ST) solar devices with considerable visible light transmission. Typically, such semitransparent or transparent light absorber tends to cause undesirable photovoltaic performance due to less light absorption.13–15 Hence, developing a CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite ST film with satisfying trade-off between light capturing and light transmission is greatly expected to achieve high performance ST PSC.
Although the transparency requirement of photovoltaic devices hinges on different usage scenarios, 25% AVT is generally regarded as a benchmark for window applications,16 which are considerable parts of BIPV. However, a majority of perovskite photovoltaic devices were in such a dilemma of choosing a high transmittance or superior PCE.17–20 Only a few ST PSCs21,22 have achieved more than 10% PCE with 25% AVT to date. To attain an ST perovskite film, an approach that reduces surface coverage23–25 by constructing island-like film was performed. Voids formed between spontaneously distributed perovskite islands accounted for a high average visible transmittance (AVT) of the active layer up to 50.3%; however, their existence simultaneously led to undesired open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) loss due to the serious recombination between n-type TiO2 compact layer (bl-TiO2) and p-type hole transporting material (HTM), resulting in a poor PCE of 3.9%. Despite recent research in that padded voids with honeycomb SiO2 scaffolds has improved the Voc value and harvested a higher PCE up to 9.5% with an active layer (AL) AVT of 37%,26 the infiltration of perovskite into the SiO2 regions was quite complicated. On the other hand, decreasing the thickness of continuous perovskite film27–30 is another method to enhance light transmittance. For instance, evaporating ∼54 nm and ∼141 nm perovskite films have attained AVT values of 31% and 16% for their ST devices with PCE values of 5.3% and 10.1%, respectively.31 In addition, thin perovskite films of ∼129 nm30 and ∼150 nm32 have also been fabricated by solution methods to obtain 23% and 18% AVT, whose PCEs of ST devices achieve 10.81% and 9.1%, respectively. Besides optimization of the perovskite film, reforming the transparent electrode33,34 and inserting additional layers, such as microcavity structures31,35 or dielectric mirrors,36 have also been reported to enhance the device transmittance and improve their photovoltaic performance. In addition, considering the morphology control of perovskite itself has exhibited prominent effect on highly efficient opaque PSCs,37–39 can one design new morphology40 of a semitransparent perovskite film for a high performance ST perovskite solar cell?
In this report, we demonstrate the fabrication of an ordered macroporous (MP) ST CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer via a sacrificial polystyrene (PS) microsphere template with AL AVT of 20–45% by changing the PS diameters and precursor concentrations. The MP CH3NH3PbI3 film with a size of more than 200 nm guaranteed sufficient light-harvesting, whereas the macropores inside the film increase the light transmittance. Furthermore, the continuous MP CH3NH3PbI3 film has prevented bl-TiO2 from contacting with the HTM and spurred hole extraction and collection at the perovskite/HTM interface according to its bowl-like structure. In addition, the existence of a PS template also guided the growth of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film and improved the crystallinity, resulting in fewer defects and charge recombination. Herein, the optimized 400 nm MP CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film has achieved a very high AL AVT of 36.5% and an impressive PCE of 11.7% owing to the improved short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) compared to island-like perovskite films (champion PCE = 5.6%). Transient photovoltage (TPV), transient photocurrent (TPC) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements have been conducted to rationalize transport and recombination performance of these ST perovskite devices, proving that the utilization of a sacrificial PS template is beneficial to obtain a high quality perovskite film with advanced charge-carrier transport and reduced recombination.
Experimental
Synthesis of CH3NH3I
CH3NH3I was synthesized by blending methylamine (33 wt% in methanol) and hydroiodic acid (57 wt% aqueous) in a molar ratio of 1.5:1 in ice-water bath stirring for 2 h, then crystallized by spin-steaming and purified by recrystallization with diethyl ether before being dried in vacuum and stored in an N2 atmosphere.
Fabrication of macroporous perovskite films
Different sizes of the polystyrene microspheres were synthesized in an emulsifier-free system.41,42 The PS monolayer on TiO2 compact layer coated FTO glass was fabricated by spin-coating PS colloid precursors at 5000–7000 rpm and dried at 100 °C. The fabrication of the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer on the PS monolayer was conducted by spin-coating a precursor solution containing 0.6 M PbI2 and 0.66 M CH3NH3I dissolved in DMSO at 3000–5000 rpm for 30 s and annealing at 150 °C for 10 min. To remove the PS template, the aforementioned perovskite film was immersed in toluene for 20 seconds, and then annealed at 150 °C for 1 min. The island-like perovskite film was fabricated by spin-coating the same precursor directly on a TiO2 compact layer.
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
FTO glass (8 Ω per square) was pre-treated with 4 M HCl and zinc powder. The etched substrates were then cleaned with deionized water, alcohol and acetone via ultrasonication. The TiO2 compact layer was formed by spin-coating the obtained colloid solution43,44 diluted 3 times in anhydrous ethanol at 2000 rpm for 60 s, followed by annealing at 500 °C for 1 h in ambient air. The annealed TiO2 compact layers were immersed in an aqueous 0.04 M TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 minutes before sintering at 520 °C for 30 minutes. The HTM solution comprised 72.3 mg mL−1 spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenyl-amine)-9,9′-spirobifluoren-e)/chlorobenzene with addition of 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) and 17.5 μL bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSi) solution (520 mg in acetonitrile) was then deposited onto the macroporous perovskite films by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 60 s. Finally, the gold electrode was deposited by magnetron sputtering.
Characterizations
The phase structure was characterized on a Rigaku Co. X-ray powder diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation = 1.5418 Å). Ultra-high resolution electron microscopy (FE-SEM, SU8010) was utilized to investigate the morphology of the macroporous films and PSC devices. The UV-vis transmittance spectra of perovskite active layer were obtained using a UV-2400. The photovoltaic performance of the PSCs was recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter with a delay time of 10 ms under one sun AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination with a solar light simulator (Oriel, Model: 91192), which was calibrated with a NREL standard Si solar cell. The active areas of all solar cells were 8 mm2. The incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained on a keithley 2000 multimeter as a function of the wavelength from 380 to 850 nm based on the Spectral Products DK 240 monochromator. Photoluminescence (PL) (excitation at 406.2 nm) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) (excitation at 406.2 nm and emission at 760 nm) were measured with Edinburgh Instruments LTD (FLSP920). Transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements were taken using a pump pulse generated by a 450 nm laser and background illumination of white LED. The incident light intensities have been tuned from 30.3 mW cm−2 to 100.0 mW cm−2 (1 sun condition). The devices were connected to a digital oscilloscope (TDS-2014C). The open-circuit condition was formed by setting the input impedance of the oscilloscope to 10 MΩ, whereas the short-circuit condition was formed by connecting a 50 Ω resistor to the circuit in series. The EIS measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) in the frequency range from 40 Hz to 2 MHz, applying open-circuit voltage derived from the J–V test without illumination condition.
Results and discussion
The morphologies of MP CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film
The fabrication of MP CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin films is depicted in Scheme 1. The polystyrene (PS) microspheres were utilized as sacrificial templates.40 First, the PS microsphere monolayer was deposited onto the TiO2 blocking layer (bl-TiO2) coated FTO substrate via spin-coating (step 1). Subsequently, the ordered PS microsphere monolayer was filled with organo-metal halide perovskite precursor solution by spin-coating (step 2), and then annealed at 150 °C for 10 min (step 3). Finally, the CH3NH3PbI3 coated PS microsphere film was immersed in toluene for a few seconds to remove the PS template (step 4), which resulted in the formation of ordered MP semitransparent CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film (step 5).

The morphologies of MP CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film and its photovoltaic device structure were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fig. 1a displays the ordered packed PS microsphere monolayer of 400 nm on FTO/bl-TiO2. After the removal of the PS template, the seamlessly aligned MP CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite with pore size of 400 nm is formed, as shown in Fig. 1b and c. PS microspheres, 200 nm and 600 nm in diameter, were also synthesized to prepare MP CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films with various film transparencies for comparison, depicted in Fig. S1a–f.† The cross-section SEM image of integral MP CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell (Fig. 1d) clearly shows that the hole-transport material (HTM) interpenetrated into the bowl-like structure of MP CH3NH3PbI3 film sufficiently with an entire thickness of 400 nm. Such close contact between perovskite and HTM is assumed to attain efficient hole-extraction at perovskite/HTM interface and suppress recombination, which will be discussed later. For comparison, the perovskite film fabricated in the same batch without PS template is shown in Fig. S1g and h.† The perovskite films exhibit a random island-like morphology with a lower coverage of perovskite and plenty of pin-holes on the formative perovskite domains.

Characterizations of the MP CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film
The XRD patterns of various CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films (Fig. 2a) were measured to characterize the growth and assess the crystallinity of perovskite films. Comparing with island-like (w/o PS) perovskite film, the intensity ratio of the facet (200) at 20.02°45 to (110) at 14.85° for MP CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films decreases obviously from 0.33 to less than 0.11, illustrating the growth of perovskite along the c axis46,47 by introducing a PS template instead of forming randomly grown perovskite domains. Moreover, the island-like CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film also generates the widest FWHM of the (110) plane at 12.2° extracted from the XRD patterns as compared to MP perovskite, pointing out more trap sites in perovskite polycrystalline film,48 associating with the poor morphology. In contrast, the MP CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film with a pore size of 400 nm presents the sharpest diffraction peak with a narrow FWHM of 10.91°, which is possibly due to the highest ordered structures proved by SEM images in Fig. 1 and S1.† Thus, fabricating ordered MP perovskite films via a PS template is beneficial to enhance the crystallinity.

(b) Transmittance spectra of MP perovskite with different sizes and island-like (w/o PS) perovskite layers deposited on FTO/TiO2 substrate. (c) J–V curves of typical MP perovskite solar cells with various pore sizes measured under AM 1.5 G one sun (100 mW cm−2) illumination. 
Such MP CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films shown in Fig. 1 and S1† exhibited semitransparent behavior due to their hollow structures, which can potentially be applied in BIPV, tandem cell, or PV-PEC applications. To characterize the transparency, the transmission spectra of various MP CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite films deposited on FTO/TiO2 were measured and depicted in Fig. 2b. The transmission spectra of single CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite active layer films by excluding the FTO/TiO2 substrate are displayed in Fig. S2a.† The AVT of these perovskite layer films were obtained by calculating the mean values of transmittance in the visible region of the spectra between 380 and 760 nm. Since transmittance is closely associated with the amount of light absorbers,49 it is obvious that the AVT decreases with the increasing thickness of MP perovskite film, proved by absorption spectra in Fig. S2b.† Accordingly, the 200 nm MP-perovskite film achieved the highest AVT as 35.3%, followed by 27.5% for 400 nm and 22.2% for 600 nm. Subsequently, comparing the island-like perovskite film with MP-perovskite film of similar thickness (400 nm), the AVT is slightly higher for the island-like perovskite layer of 32.3% due to the voids between the perovskite domains, whereas the continuous MP perovskite film absorbs more light. The AVTs of the photoactive layer, which excludes the FTO/bl-TiO2 anode have also been calculated. The AL AVTs of island-like, 200 nm, 400 nm, and 600 nm, MP perovskite films are 40.6%, 44.3%, 36.5%, and 28.5%, respectively, which are in accordance with the AVT varieties aforementioned. Overall, such high transparency macroporous perovskite film can potentially be used as ST solar cell for BIPV.
Photovoltaic performance of MP PSC
Because MP perovskite semitransparent films possess high crystallinity and favorable transmittance, their applications in perovskite solar cells have been proceeded compared to island-like perovskite films. The MP perovskite device has a configuration of FTO/bl-TiO2/macroporous MAPbI3/Spiro-OmeTAD/Au, whereas the control device is fabricated without a PS template. Fig. 2c shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the best-performing PSCs devices based on macroporous perovskite films of different sizes, whose extracted performance parameters are shown in Table 1. The incident photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of these perovskite cells based on MP and island-like structures is displayed in Fig. S2c,† which are in reasonable agreement with their Jsc values.

Moreover, the statistical distributions of performance characteristics obtained from 20 cells are displayed in Fig. S3.† As for the control samples fabricated without a PS template, an average PCE of 4.4% was obtained with an average Jsc of 12.6 mA cm−2, Voc of 707 mV and FF of 0.50. The inferior Jsc and Voc are closely consistent with its poor morphology and low crystallinity of perovskite film. The island-like film composed of random domains absorbs less light than the continuous film of a similar thickness, as shown in Fig. S2b,† and as a result yields a lower Jsc. In addition, the voids between perovskite domains and trap sites, resulting from poor crystallinity, render an increase in charge recombination, leading to a Voc loss. In contrast, the devices based on macroporous perovskite films have attained ordered and continuous films, which prevent the compact layer from contacting the HTM, ultimately affording apparent increases of Voc and FF values. Comparing the devices based on macroporous perovskite films with various diameters, solar cells based on 400 nm macroporous perovskite films have achieved the optimal performance claiming an average Jsc of 18.2 mA cm−2, an Voc of 950 mV and a fill factor of 0.60, yielding an average PCE of 10.3%, whereas the PCE of the champion cell is 11.7% (Jsc = 19.2 mA cm−2, Voc = 950 mV, FF = 0.64). The 3.3 mA cm−2 enhancement of Jsc from 200 nm to 400 nm macroporous perovskite films stems from the increased light harvesting caused by more perovskite, whereas the 111 mV decrease in Voc from 400 nm to 600 nm is due to the aggravated recombination induced by the thicker film. Herein, 400 nm is the optimized diameter of the PS template for fabricating macroporous perovskite films. In addition, the 400 nm MP perovskite device also exhibits less hysteresis, as shown in Fig. S4,† when compared to the device based on the island-like perovskite film, which should be ascribed to the efficient hole extraction at perovskite/HTM interface by MP structures. By magnetron sputtering the semitransparent gold cathode of ∼20 nm, the integral semitransparent devices based on 400 nm MP perovskite films attained a device AVT of 17.3%, whose PCE is 8.4%, shown in Fig. S5.†
To determine if an increase or decrease in the concentration of precursor is beneficial to improve the PCE, 0.4 M and 0.8 M PbI2–MAI precursor were employed in this regard. As shown in Fig. S6a and Table S1,† decreasing the precursor concentration cannot cover up the integral PS template, which will generate voids on bl-TiO2 in the end. Herein, although AL AVT increased to 39.0% (shown in Fig. S7b and c†) when applied to perovskite devices (shown in Fig. S7a†), an apparent drop of Jsc from 18.2 mA cm−2 to 16.7 mA cm−2 with a decrease Voc from 950 mV to 793 mV appears.
On the other hand, increasing the precursor concentration to 0.8 M yielded a top layer on the MP-film (shown in Fig. S6b†), leading to a decline in transmittance. In addition, the increased thickness also probably offered more recombination trap cites in the perovskite film, resulting in a Voc loss. Herein, the 0.6 M perovskite precursor is the optimized one owing to its adequate light-harvesting and less charge recombination.
Recombination process of MP PSCs
To investigate the influence of carrier recombination character by the perovskite film quality, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements of ordered macroporous perovskite with different sizes (200 nm, 400 nm, and 600 nm) and disordered island-like perovskite film deposited on blank glass were carried out,50,51 shown in Fig. 3. The PL intensity and PL decays indicate defect states and recombination process in the perovskite films.52 From the intensity of the photoluminescence peak in Fig. 3a, island-like perovskite film presents the lowest PL intensity, proving that the introduction of the PS template during the growth of perovskite is beneficial to eliminate the defects and trap sites in perovskite films, which is in correspondence to the XRD patterns. In addition, since the film thickness is another effect factor of the PL intensity because of the different light absorption,53–55 the increase in PL intensity from the 200 nm MP perovskite film to the 400 nm MP perovskite film could be related to both the increase in film thickness and fewer defect states, whereas the slight decrease in PL intensity from 400 nm MP perovskite to 600 nm MP perovskite film should be mostly ascribed to more defect states for the latter, indicating that the 400 nm PS template has the highest quality perovskite film with the fewest defects and trap sites due to the highest crystallinity, corresponding to the XRD patterns. Furthermore, time constants τe were obtained by fitting TRPL curves (Fig. 3b) to evaluate exciton life time of perovskite. As a result, the fitted time constants τe of 200 nm, 400 nm, and 600 nm macroporous perovskite and island-like perovskite are calculated to be 141.93, 225.58, 214.94 and 110.00 ns, respectively. The faster PL decay of island-perovskite film confirmed the exacerbated recombination, which is ascribed to the poor morphology with pin-holes and low crystallinity. Moreover, the longest PL lifetime of the 400 nm MP perovskite film has also proven its preferable film quality due to the highly ordered structures and superior crystallinity. PL and TRPL measurements (Fig. S8†) of the ST devices based on the different precursor concentrations reveal that the increase or decrease in the precursor concentrations would both yield more defects and trap sites for charge recombination, lending credence to the optimized concentration of 0.6 M.
 Fig. 3  (a) Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) (excitation at 406.2 nm) and (b) time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra (excitation at 406.2 nm and emission at 760 nm) of MP perovskite films with various sizes and island-like perovskite film. 
To further investigate the charge carrier dynamics along the entire pathway in the perovskite solar devices, transient photovoltage and photocurrent measurements have been implemented.48,56,57 The well fitted charge-carrier transport life times (τtrans) and charge-recombination lifetimes (τcharge-carrier) of certain perovskite devices under different illumination are displayed in Fig. 4a and b, deriving from their single exponential fitted photovoltage and photocurrent decay curves, as shown in Fig. S9 and S10.† As shown in Fig. 4a, all devices based on MP perovskite present shorter carrier transport lifetimes compared to the island-like perovskite device at any incident light intensity, indicating enhanced charge-extraction and transport performance by importing MP structures. Such rapid charge carrier transport is ascribed to the efficient hole-extraction at MP perovskite/HTM interface, which results from the sufficient interpenetration of HTM into the bowl-like perovskite. According to the TPV test, Fig. 4b exhibits prolonged lifetimes of photogenerated charge carriers for MP perovskite devices compared to the island-like perovskite device, manifesting an ameliorated recombination mechanism and improved film quality for MP perovskite. The shortest lifetime of the island-like perovskite device should be attributed to its inferior perovskite crystallinity and direct contact of the ETL and HTM, which was caused by the voids between perovskite domains, both leading to severe recombination of devices in the end. Among the MP perovskite devices with different sizes, the carrier lifetime of 400 nm MP device (75.9 μs, 33.3 mW cm−2) is obviously superior to 200 nm (64.9 μs, 33.3 mW cm−2) and 600 nm (53.9 μs, 33.3 mW cm−2) MP device, which are in high correspondence to their Voc variations. Such optimal lifetime was attributed to the reduced trap defects and advanced crystallinity, which has also been confirmed by PL and TRPL measurements. Moreover, based on the TPC and TPV characterization, one can define that (1)where the incident light intensity dependent τtrans and τcharge-carrier of different devices are tabulated in Table S2.† Relying on the lengthened carrier lifetime and rapid charge transport, the calculated charge collection efficiency of 400 nm MP device is higher than that of island-like perovskite, corresponding to their apparent PCE variations. Apart from the TPV test, EIS measurements have also been conducted to assess interfacial charge-transport process and carrier recombination58 in MP and island-like PSCs. The Nyquist plots of these cells were measured at each Voc bias in the dark and are depicted in Fig. 4c. The values of RHTM and Rrec tabulated in Table S3† are fitted from such Nyquist plots by the equivalent circuit inside Fig. 4c. Notably, the RHTM of island-like perovskite cells (32.21 Ω cm2) decreases when compared to the MP cells (31.17 Ω cm2 for 200 nm, 27.64 Ω cm2 for 400 nm and 31.46 Ω cm2 for 600 nm), whereas the Rrec goes in the opposite direction (76.89 Ω cm2 for island like film, 132.4 Ω cm2 for 200 nm, 172.2 Ω cm2 for 400 nm and 112.3 Ω cm2 for 600 nm MP), indicating enhanced charge transport in HTM/perovskite interface and reduced recombination after importing the MP structures, which is in correspondence with the TPV and TPC results. Accordingly, there is no doubt that MP structures are beneficial for perovskite cells to achieve more efficient photovoltaic conversion by improved transport and recombination performance.

Aging test of MP PSCs
The aging test of 400 nm MP and island-like perovskite cells were conducted to assess their device stability in ambient dry air, as shown in Fig. 4d and S11.† It is apparent that ∼90% of the initial photovoltaic performance was retained for the 400 nm MP PSC after the 500 h aging test, whereas the island-like perovskite cell retained only ∼43% of the initial efficiency. Moreover, EIS measurement (shown in Fig. 5 and Table S3†) displays that the RHTM increases (from 32.21 to 50.57 Ω cm2) and Rrec decreases (from 76.89 to 54.08 Ω cm2) after 500 h aging for the island-like perovskite device, whereas the 400 nm MP ones show slight variations (RHTM increases from 27.64 to 28.23 Ω cm2, while Rrec decreases from 172.2 to 159.3 Ω cm2) after 500 h, indicating an inhibition of perovskite decomposition by importing the MP structures.

Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate the fabrication of ordered monolayer macroporous perovskite semitransparent films and its application to PSC devices. Highly ordered and continuous macroporous structures have yielded enhanced crystallinity, eliminated Voc loss and reduced film defects. Transient photocurrent/photovoltage and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies revealed the superior charge transport and ameliorated recombination process of ordered macroporous perovskite solar cells compared to island-like perovskite devices. In addition, MP perovskite achieves adequate light absorption while the hollows inside offer channels for light transmission, resulting in a satisfactory balance between light-harvesting and transparency. Leveraging the aforementioned benefits together with optimized macropore size as 400 nm, the macroporous perovskite solar device has a significant PCE up to 11.7% with an active layer average visible transmission of 36.5%, strongly reflecting its potential in BIPVs and tandem solar cells.
