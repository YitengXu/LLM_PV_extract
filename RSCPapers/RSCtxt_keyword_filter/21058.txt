    , Accepted 17th August 2021First published on 23rd August 2021AbstractNon-fullerene ETMs are emerging as a hot topic in the field of PSCs due to the inherent shortcomings of fullerene derivatives. Herein, the potential of SubPcs as ETMs in PSCs has been evaluated. To this end, ETMs based on two SubPcs (with chlorine or fluorine at the axial position) have been incorporated in PSCs, where the perovskite is deposited by either solution processing (CsFAMAPbIBr) or thermal evaporation (MAPI). The device performance and morphology of these devices are analyzed in depth using several techniques, and the interfacial effects induced by the SubPcs are studied using PL and TR-PL. In all cases, the SubPc with axial chlorine led to higher efficiencies. Thus, a maximum PCE of 10.8% was achieved with the champion device using a SubPc/C60 double-layer ETM.
1. Introduction
Since their introduction in 2009,1 hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted worldwide attention by opening up a new vista in the photovoltaic (PV) field.2a–d By virtue of their excellent physical properties (e.g., efficient light absorption, ambipolar charge transport character or long charge diffusion lengths),3a,b perovskite (PVK) materials have led to impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 25% in a matter of ten years.4 These merits, together with their low cost and easy fabrication using multiple thin film deposition methods, have made PSCs a viable alternative to silicon-based PV technology.
According to the way of stacking the functional layers, PSCs can be classified into two device configurations: conventional n-i-p type and inverted p-i-n type.2d The latter case, despite affording lower PCEs at present, has particularly piqued the attention of many research groups owing to its simple manufacturing process,5a amenability to low-temperature fabrication techniques, and superior stability in comparison to n-i-p devices due to the chemical degradation of TiO2 under UV radiation.5b One area of focus for improving the efficiency of such inverted PSCs is the optimization of the electron transport material (ETM), which, in addition to extracting the electrons efficiently, plays a key role in the device stability since it is part of the outermost PVK/ETM interface. In this sense, although extensive research has been carried out to optimize the hole transport materials (HTMs),6a the ETMs are mainly monopolised by fullerene and its derivatives, as phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM).6b,c However, these high-cost compounds, in spite of having excellent electron transport properties, do not prevent moisture and oxygen penetration6b and present poor film morphology,7 which is detrimental for the device stability, and do not possess a tuneable LUMO energy level,8 a feature that significantly limits their implementation in PSCs containing absorbers with a specific range of band gap values. These intrinsic shortcomings of fullerenes avoid the preparation of highly efficient PSCs and, therefore, there is an urgent need to develop non-fullerene organic ETMs for further evolution of PSCs in terms of efficiency and stability.
Boron subphthalocyanines (SubPcs) currently hold a privileged position among the most promising non-fullerene acceptors in organic photovoltaics (OPVs).9 Acting as acceptors, these robust and non-planar aromatic compounds, with their excellent and tunable optical, electronic, and morphological properties, have led to remarkable efficiencies as high as 8.4% and 7.5% in fullerene-free planar- and bulk-heterojunction solar cells, respectively.10a,b Nevertheless, although some authors have preliminarily reported the use of SubPcs in perovskite solar cells as HTMs or passivating agents,11 their application as ETMs, to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported so far. Taking the above-mentioned facts into account, we believed that SubPc-based acceptor materials are potential candidates to replace fullerene also in p-i-n inverted PSCs and/or to further enhance the poor perovskite/fullerene-based interface.12
Herein, we explore for the first time the use of SubPcs as ETMs in planar PSCs. For this purpose, we synthesized and tested two different SubPc derivatives, Cl-SubPcCl6 and F-SubPcCl6. We selected the well-known Cl-SubPcCl6 owing to its stability, strong acceptor capabilities, good solid-state organization, and high thin film quality.13 On the other hand, we also chose the fluorinated version of that compound (F-SubPcCl6) since the lower size and electronegativity of the axial fluorine atom can favour the columnar organization of SubPc molecules14a–c and thus improve their electrical conductivity. PSC devices were prepared to incorporate both SubPcs as ETMs, either alone or in combination with C60, where the PVK active layer was deposited by a solution processing method (triple-cation mixed-halide perovskite; CsFAMAPbIBr) or by thermal evaporation (methylammonium lead iodide; MAPI). The PV performance of the studied PSCs was deeply characterized by J–V hysteresis, external quantum efficiency (EQE), and maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and the morphology was observed by scanning-electron-microscopy (SEM). The solution- and vacuum-deposited perovskite layers as well as the influence of the SubPcs on them were analysed by photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved PL (TRPL). Thus, we achieved a maximum PCE of 10.8% with the best performing device whose ETM is composed of both SubPc and C60.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization of Cl- and F-SubPcCl6
The synthetic route of Cl- and F-SubPcCl6 is shown in Fig. 1. First, Cl-SubPcCl6 was obtained via a cyclotrimerization reaction of dichloro-phthalonitrile by adapting the method previously reported by Bender et al.15 Our synthesis entails the heating of the phthalonitrile at a higher temperature (i.e., 180 °C) than that typically employed in SubPc synthesis (i.e., 140 °C) in the presence of 1 equiv. of BCl3 (1 M in p-xylene) and o-dichlorobenzene as the co-solvent. Thus, after 24 h of reaction and column chromatography purification, the targeted Cl-SubPcCl6 was obtained as a purple solid in a 68% yield. Then, F-SubPcCl6 was prepared by a substitution reaction of Cl-SubPcCl6 with BF3OEt2 in toluene.

To get a preliminary idea about the aggregation grade of Cl- and F-SubPcCl6 in the solid state, we recorded their absorption spectra in solution and in the thin film. As shown in Fig. 1, both derivatives exhibit identical absorption profiles in THF solutions, displaying the maximum absorption peaks at ca. 570 nm and an ε value of 39.000 M−1 cm−1. These signals were broadened and red-shifted 15–20 nm in the thin film (590 nm for Cl- and 585 nm for F-), which could be attributed to the formation of columnar H-type-like aggregates in the solid state. Nevertheless, significant changes in the spectral shape were not observed, suggesting that the aggregation is not so strong as, for example, their phthalocyanine (Pc) homologues.16
2.2. Performance with solution-processed perovskites
The electron transport capability of Cl- and F-SubPcCl6 in PSCs was firstly evaluated in devices in which the PVK material is incorporated by solution processing. To this end, inverted PSCs were fabricated with the device structure of FTO/NiOx/PTAA/CsFAMAPbIBr/PEAI/ETM/BCP/Cr/Au, being ETM a thin film of a SubPc or a SubPc/C60 bilayer. PEAI was added to the triple cation perovskite to form a low-dimensional 2D perovskite which will passivate surface defects and improve the perovskite stability.17 Bathocuproine (BCP) of 3 nm-thickness was thermally evaporated to form an ohmic contact between the ETM and the top electrode and eliminate the charge accumulation at the interface.18 In addition, a 1 nm-thin layer of Cr was employed to improve the device stability in air.19 The corresponding device structure and energy level diagram are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. In these devices, NiOx and poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) served as HTMs, and the triple-cation perovskite was deposited employing the experimental procedure previously reported by some of us.16 Unfortunately, the devices using just a SubPc as the ETM shorted and consequently we decided to use a SubPc/C60 double layer ETM. To explore the influence of the SubPc layer, different thicknesses of the Cl- or F-SubPcCl6 layer (from 2 to 5 nm) were examined. The solar cells using only C60 as a single ETL (0 nm of SubPc layer) were taken as a reference device.

(c and e) J–V curves of the most efficient devices containing Cl-SubPcCl6 or F-SubPcCl6, respectively. (d and f) EQE spectra of the most efficient devices containing Cl-SubPcCl6 or F-SubPcCl6, respectively. The J–V curve and the EQE spectra of the control device (w/o SubPc) were added for comparison. 
The J–V curves of the champion devices are presented in Fig. 2c and e, and the extracted PV parameters are summarized in Table 1. As expected, the photovoltaic performance of PSCs is strongly affected by the SubPc layer thickness, and 2 nm of Cl- and F-SubPcCl6 provide, respectively, the best efficiencies of 10.8% and 10.3%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 987 and 996 mV, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.38 and 17.30 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.63 and 0.61, respectively. It should be mentioned that, although both SubPcs exhibit comparable efficiencies, Cl-SubPcCl6 slightly outperformed F-SubPcCl6 owing to its higher Jsc and FF. Notably, the reference device provided a higher efficiency exceeding 13% compared to those of SubPc-based devices. The PCE distribution based on eight devices per device condition is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). As can be seen from Table 1 (entry w/o), the lower efficiencies with SubPcs mainly arise from the losses in Jsc (20.40 mA cm−2 for 0 nm of SubPc) suggesting that the SubPc layer is, in part, hampering the electron extraction. Further insights into these Jsc losses were provided by inspection of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves (Fig. 2d and f). The EQE spectra show that the photoresponse from 350 to 800 nm significantly decreases upon insertion of 2–5 nm of Cl- and F-SubPcCl6 in the electron transport layer, also indicating a non-efficient electron collection by the SubPc layer.

Next, we studied the hysteresis behaviour of our devices by measuring the PCE in both forward and reverse scan directions. As shown in Fig. 3a–d and Table 1, PSCs based on the two SubPcs displayed relatively consistent J–V curves, independent of the scan direction, indicating a negligible hysteresis effect in our devices. In addition, the stability of our devices was briefly assessed by monitoring and plotting the PCE as a function of time (Fig. 3e and f). Remarkably, in contrast to the control device, the 2 nm SubPc-containing PSCs present an initial burn-in, followed by a recovery of the efficiency before reaching stabilization at the highest value. On the other hand, 5 nm of Cl- or F-SubPcCl6 led to lower device stability over time.

(e and f) Stability of the PSC containing Cl-SubPcCl6 or F-SubPcCl6, respectively, measured under 1 sun illumination in power point tracking conditions in air. 
To study recombination losses and the role of Cl- and F-SubPcCl6, steady-state PL and time-resolved PL (TR-PL) decay measurements were recorded for PVK, PVK/Cl-SubPcCl6, and PVK/F-SubPcCl6 films as shown in Fig. 4 (see Table S1, ESI,† for further details). Surprisingly, no PL-quenching was appreciated in the SubPc-covered PVK film compared with the bare PVK as shown in Fig. 4a. Indeed, an increase in the PL intensity was observed in the presence of SubPcs. This finding could be ascribed to the effective PVK passivation by the SubPc material suppressing the surface defects of the perovskite layer acting as a thin passivation layer. In accordance with the PL measurements, the TR-PL spectra (Fig. 4b and Table S1, ESI†) reveal that PVK/Cl-SubPcCl6 and PVK/F-SubPcCl6 films displayed decay with slightly reduced values to that of the only PVK film (from t1 52.8 ns (PVK) to 38.2 ns (F-SubPcCl6) and 45 ns (Cl-SubPcCl6)), which can be attributed to the electron extraction from the perovskite to the SubPc as both phenomena are present and not easily decoupled.20

With the aim of determining whether the low capability of these X-SubPcCl6 is due to a poor thin film morphology, we studied our devices by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Fig. 5 and Fig. S9, ESI†). Top-view scanning electron microscope images were obtained by analyzing the SubPc film morphology deposited on top of solution-processed perovskite layers (Fig. S9, ESI†). The images show that the morphology of the SubPc is homogeneous without the presence of aggregation of the material. The cross-sectional SEM image of the SubPc-based PSCs (Fig. 5) shows that all the layers, except the thin transport layers, are visible with uniform and homogeneous morphology. Similar characteristics are observed in the reference device, which also reveals a well-ordered and planar multilayer structure. Thereby, we can assume that the lower photocurrent generation mainly stems from the electronic features of the SubPc derivatives.

2.3. Performance with vacuum-deposited perovskites
In addition, we preliminarily evaluated the ETM capabilities of Cl- and F-SubPcCl6 in PSCs based on a vacuum deposited PVK active layer. In this case, the devices were set up according to our previous study of a co-evaporated perovskite with the following configuration: FTO/spiro-OMeTAD/MAPI/ETM/BCP/Cr/Au, where the spiro-OMeTAD and MAPI are the HTM and the PVK of choice, respectively.21 On the other hand, the ETM is made up of a SubPc (10 nm) single layer or a SubPc (10 nm)/C60 (20 nm) double-layer.
The J–V characteristics and the detailed photovoltaic parameters of these devices are shown in Fig. 6a, b and summarized in Table 2. In contrast to the devices containing solution-processed PVK, in this configuration we were able to characterize the devices with a SubPc as the single ETM. When using a SubPc as the single ETM, Cl-SubPcCl6 gives rise to a higher efficiency than F-SubPcCl6 (2.6 vs. 1.3%). On the other hand, Cl-SubPcCl6 also provided better results in the double-layer ETM by showing an efficiency of 7.7%, with a Voc of 1022 mV, a Jsc of 15.02 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.50. Unfortunately, the presence of C60 in the ETM is still needed since the devices with only a SubPc as the ETM suffered from very low currents. Similar to the PSCs with solution processed PVK, the reference devices using MAPI exhibit a higher PCE (13%) when compared to SubPc-containing devices. Statistical data were obtained from eight devices per each condition and the corresponding PCE distribution is presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†). As observed with CsFAMAPbIBr-based PSCs, these lower PCEs are also mainly due to the Jsc losses caused by the SubPc material. The PL and TR-PL spectra of the MAPI devices are presented in Fig. 6c and d, respectively.

Interestingly, in this case, we did not find the passivation effect observed with CsFAMAPbIBr. Instead, when the perovskite layer forms a contact with SubPcs, a slight PL-quenching phenomenon was observed, suggesting that the SubPc layer is barely inhibiting electron–hole recombination. Accordingly, the TR-PL spectrum of the MAPI/SubPc film revealed a decreased decay lifetime compared with that of the bare PVK. Finally, as shown in Fig. 6e and f, the morphology of these devices was also studied by SEM. Again, the cross-sectional SEM images of the devices with Cl-SubPcCl6, F-SubPcCl6, and C60 reveal an excellent thin film morphology and a well-defined planar multilayer architecture.
3. Conclusions
In summary, two SubPc derivatives, namely Cl-SubPcCl6 and F-SubPcCl6, have been employed as ETMs in PSCs. For this study, the SubPcs have been incorporated, either alone or in double-layer with C60, in two types of inverted PSCs. The first one, which is based on a triple cation solution-processed PVK (CsFAMAPbIBr), yielded a maximum PCE of 10.8%. The second one, in which the PVK active layer comprises co-evaporated MAPI, led to a PCE of 7.7%. In both configurations, the Cl-SubPcCl6 provided better results than F-SubPcCl6, and the reference device (C60 as the single ETM) outperformed the SubPc containing devices. As deduced from the J–V curves and EQE spectra, as well as from the photoluminescence study, these lower efficiencies mainly arise from the low charge extraction capability that the SubPcs present in this kind of PSCs. Nevertheless, the SEM images of our devices reveal that our fabrication method is very efficient to incorporate a SubPc as the electron transport layer of PSCs.
Considering that it is the first report documenting the use of a SubPc as the ETM in PSCs, we believe that this work establishes a fundamental starting point and paves the way for further research of SubPcs as non-fullerene ETMs in PSCs. Following this this direction, many other studies are currently being investigated in our laboratories.

During the development of this work and just very recently, He and co-workers reported that the addition of SubPc in a C60-based ETM significantly improves the stability in inverted PSCs.   W. Chen, B. Han, Q. Hu, M. Gu, Y. Zhu, W. Yang, Y. Zhou, D. Luo, F. Liu, R. Cheng, R. Zhu, S. Feng, A. B. Djurišić, T. P. Russell and Z. He, Sci. Bull., 2021, 66, 991–1002 CrossRef CAS  . Due to their promising results in terms of stability and efficiency, we followed their experimental procedure by testing the device configuration in our facilities. However, the resulting devices were shorted or lead to very low efficiencies, probably to HTM issues. Inspired by their work, we developed a broader study of p-i-n solar cells evaluating SubPc with different axial halogen atom.
