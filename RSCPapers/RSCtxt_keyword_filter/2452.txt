    , Accepted 14th January 2022First published on 15th January 2022AbstractWith the use of ethylene glycol as a solvent, polyvinylpyrrolidone as a surfactant and hydrazine hydrate as a reducing agent, uniform spherical ZnTe microstructures were synthesized in a homogeneous reactor by a simple solvothermal method. The influence of the synthesis conditions on the morphology was studied. The optimal conditions for preparing ZnTe microspheres of uniform size were 0.2 g PVP and 1.2 g NaOH. The ZnTe crystal nuclei quickly grew into ZnTe primary nanoparticles at the beginning of the reaction. Furthermore, ZnTe microspheres were formed by the ZnTe primary nanoparticles through the directional attachment mechanism. The photoelectrical properties of the ZnTe microspheres were investigated by fabricating a photodetector based on a ZnTe microsphere film and studying their corresponding current–voltage characteristics in the dark and under laser illumination at room temperature. Under the irradiation of 535 nm pulsed incident light with a switch cycle of 4 s, the laser power of 100 mW and bias voltage of +5.0 V, the photodetector shows a photocurrent of 0.513 μA and a responsivity of 6.72 μA W−1. The ZnTe microsphere photodetector shows an obvious photoelectric signal and good stability. The rise and decay times of the photodetector are 96.93 ms and 103.57 ms, respectively, and the response time is much faster than that of the recently reported photodetectors based on ZnTe nanomaterials.
Introduction
The absorption and emission spectra of II–VI semiconductor nanomaterials are usually in the visible light range, and have been widely used in the field of optoelectronic devices, such as light-emitting diodes,1 photodetectors,2 lasers3 and solar cells.4 Zinc telluride (ZnTe), as an important member of the group II–VI semiconductors, has a direct band gap of 2.26 eV at room temperature,5 and the Bohr exciton radius is 6.2 nm.6 In particular, compared with many other semiconductors, ZnTe has a more negative conduction band edge position (−1.7 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE)),7 which can provide a greater driving force for the transfer of interface electrons from the semiconductor to the electron acceptor. Therefore, ZnTe has broad application prospects in improving the power conversion efficiency of solar cells and designing new photocatalysts to reduce CO2.8–11 With the shortage of energy and the intensification of the greenhouse effect, ZnTe may have great application value in energy and the environment. Up to now, there have been many conventional synthesis methods of ZnTe nanomaterials, including chemical vapor deposition,12 molecular beam epitaxy,13 magnetron sputtering,14 the thermal evaporation method15 and the vertical Bridgman method.16 However, some of the above-mentioned methods have complex growth techniques, slow growth rates or low yields, and some require inert gas protection, which are not suitable for mass production.17–19 Therefore, a low-cost and simple synthesis method is needed to prepare ZnTe micro-nanostructures, and a solvothermal method could meet this demand. Moreover, compared with other methods, the solvothermal method has some unique advantages, especially for large-scale production; it is a low-cost method that can produce high-purity nanomaterials in large quantities. The ZnTe crystal has large second-order nonlinear polarizability and good phase matching conditions.20 It has excellent performance in terms of detection sensitivity, detection bandwidth and stability. It is widely used in the generation and detection of terahertz waves, laser diodes, mid-infrared optoelectronic detectors and buffer layers of CdTe solar cells.2,21–23 Compared with other metal tellurides, ZnTe is  less harmful to the environment as for there is no pollution of heavy metal ions. In addition, Zn is a cheap, abundant, and environmentally friendly element. Because of the challenge of response speed, none of the previous above devices involve photosensitive materials prepared by organic liquid phase synthesis. Here, we studied the photoelectric properties of ZnTe materials synthesized by the solvothermal method.
In this work, we report a simple and easy way to prepare ZnTe micro-nanostructures of uniform size in a homogeneous reactor by the solvothermal method, and prepared microspheres of ZnTe by adjusting the amount of the surfactant PVP. The controlling factors of the amount of surfactant on the morphology evolution of the ZnTe micro-nanostructures and the influence of temperature were discussed, and the optimal conditions for the synthesis of a uniform size of ZnTe microspheres were determined. Photodetectors of ZnTe microspheres were prepared using an interdigital electrode, and their photoelectric properties were studied at room temperature. Under the irradiation of 535 nm pulse incident light, the bias voltage of +5.0 V and laser power of 100 mW, the photoresponse current and responsivity of the photodetector were 0.1068 μA and 6.72 μA W−1, respectively. The rise and decay times of the device are 96.93 ms and 103.57 ms, respectively. The response time of the ZnTe microsphere photodetector is much faster than that of most reported ZnTe photodetectors.
Experimental
Materials
In the ZnTe fabrication experiments, sodium tellurite (Na2TeO3, 3N), anhydrous zinc chloride (ZnCl2, 4N), ethylene glycol (EG, 2N), polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K-30), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 96%) and hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O) were used. All reagents used in the experiment can be used directly without further purification.
Synthesis of ZnTe microspheres
In a typical synthesis of ZnTe microspheres, 0.1329 g of Na2TeO3 (0.6 mmol), 0.2 g of PVP and 1.2 g of NaOH were fully dissolved in 30 mL of EG under magnetic stirring at 65 °C. After a homogeneous solution was formed, the mixture was finally transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave with a volume capacity of 50 mL, 2 mL of ZnCl2 solution (300 mM) as a source of Zn and 1 mL of N2H4·H2O as a reducing agent were added, and the mixture was then sealed in an autoclave and put into a homogeneous reactor. Meanwhile, the reactor was kept at 180 °C for 18 h, and the autoclave was rotated at a rate of 20 rpm in the homogeneous reactor. A schematic diagram of the homogeneous reactor is shown in Fig. 1. After the reaction, the autoclave was naturally cooled to room temperature. The products were washed several times by a mixture of deionized water and absolute ethanol and centrifuged. Finally, the precipitate was dispersed in absolute ethanol for storage.

Characterization
The phase identification and structure analysis of ZnTe micro-nanostructures were performed using an X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku Corporation D/max 2500PC) with Cu Kα (λ = 0.154056 nm) radiation with 2θ from 20° to 80°. The morphology and elementary composition of the samples was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL JSM-7900F) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The samples were fixed on the substrate with conductive glue containing C and O elements for EDS analysis. The FT-IR spectra were obtained between the wavenumbers of 400 and 4000 cm−1 using an FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific Nicolet 6700), with a resolution of 1.2 cm−1, and close to the normal incidence on the substrate. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study was carried out on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with Al Kα radiation (Beam spot diameter 250 μm). A photodetector based on ZnTe microsphere thin films was prepared by dropping ZnTe microsphere ethanol dispersion droplets onto an interdigital electrode. The gold electrode spacing of the interdigital electrode was 90 μm. The width of the gold electrode was 65 μm. The photoelectric properties of ZnTe were measured by a Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer (Keithley 4200-SCS) at room temperature. All switch cycles of the pulsed laser were 4 s.
Results and discussion
Characterization of phase and morphology
In order to illustrate the morphology and phase composition of the products in this study, the phase analysis and morphology observation of the products were carried out. The X-ray diffraction pattern and SEM image of the sample are shown in Fig. 2. According to the XRD pattern in Fig. 2(a), all diffraction peaks can be well indexed to the zinc blende (ZB) phase of ZnTe (JCPDS: 89-3054, where the lattice constant a = b = c = 0.6098 nm and the space group is F-43m (216)). The diffraction peaks at 25.276°, 29.267°, 41.866° and 49.536° respectively correspond to the diffraction planes (111), (200), (220) and (311) of the ZB structure ZnTe. No peaks from other impurity phases were observed, such as Zn or Te. Furthermore, the diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns of the ZnTe microspheres are very narrow and sharp, indicating the highly crystalline nature of the products, which is consistent with the results of other literature reports.24,25 From Fig. 2(b), the product morphology was microspheres composed of primary nanoparticles with a relatively uniform diameter of about 1.7 ± 0.1 μm. The EDS measurement result of the sample is shown in Fig. 2(c). The sample was composed of Zn and Te elements, and Si element comes from the Si substrate. XRD and SEM analysis results show that we have successfully synthesized ZnTe microspheres with higher purity by the solvothermal method.

The grain size of the ZnTe microspheres has also been calculated from the XRD data and given by the Scherrer formula: (1)where λ is the wavelength of the X-ray source, β is the FWHM of the peak and θ is the Bragg angle. The results of grain size calculation are shown in Table 1. The average grain size (D*) of the ZnTe microspheres is about 35.5 nm.

FT-IR spectroscopy
The FT-IR spectra of the obtained sample (1.2 g NaOH, 0.2 g PVP) and pure PVP are shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3a, the peaks at 1462 cm−1 and 1421 cm−1 were characteristic absorption peaks of the pyrrolidinyl group, and the absorption peaks at 1677 cm−1 and 1017 cm−1 were attributed to the stretching vibration of CO and C–N bonds in PVP,26 respectively. The peak at 1372 cm−1 was caused by the C–H bond in PVP.27 The absorption peak at 1421 cm−1 was caused by the C–N bond stretching vibration and the attachment of the CH2 group in the PVP pyrrole ring.28 Compared with the corresponding absorption peaks of pure PVP, most of the absorption peaks of the sample in Fig. 3b were weaker. There were typical peaks in Fig. 3b, indicating that PVP molecules were adsorbed on the surface of the ZnTe microspheres and cannot be washed away with deionized water and absolute ethanol. In addition, it could be seen from the figure that the 1677 cm−1 peak generated by the vibration of the CO bond in the pure PVP was red-shifted to 1635 cm−1.

XPS analysis
XPS measurement of the product obtained under the conditions of the experiment was used to study the phase and valence properties of the elements. The XPS survey scans were reported in Fig. 4. XPS spectroscopy revealed the presence of Zn and Te. The peaks at 572.6 and 1021.1 eV corresponded to Te 3d5/2 and Zn 2p3/2, respectively, indicating that the ZnTe microspheres have Zn(II) and Te(II-) valence states.29,30 It can be seen from Fig. 4(a) that for Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2, the spin–orbit coupling was 23 eV, which confirmed that the Zn atoms were well located in the ZnTe lattice.23Fig. 4(b) shows the core level XPS spectrum of Te 3d. Four peaks with different binding energies can be observed in Fig. 4(b), the origin of these peaks can be attributed to the different bonding states of the Te atoms.

The appearance of the transition peaks of Te 3d5/2 and Te 3d3/2 at binding energies of 572.6 and 582.9 eV proved the bonding of Zn–Te, while the two peaks at 576 and 586 eV correspond to the tellurium oxides composed of Te(IV). The peak of Te(IV) is higher indicating the strong TeO bonding in the ZnTe microspheres.31 The sample powder was stored for 2 weeks before the XPS test, and it may be partially oxidized. The difference in binding energy indicates that its composition depends on the structure of the Te3d peaks.
Effect of PVP
In order to study the influence of the addition of PVP on the morphology of the ZnTe micro-nanostructure, the effect of PVP in the range of 0–0.4 g on the morphology of the ZnTe micro-nanostructure was investigated. The amount of NaOH was 1.2 g in all experiments. The evolution of the morphology of the products with different PVP additions is shown in Fig. 5. It is known that PVP can be used as a surfactant, stabilizer and structure directing agent to synthesize nanomaterials.32 It can be seen from Fig. 5(a) that in the absence of PVP, irregular aggregation with the coexistence of cubic nanoparticles and microspheres was observed. ZnTe microspheres of uniform size were formed when PVP was increased to 0.2 g. As a surfactant, an appropriate amount of PVP can be adsorbed on the ZnTe crystal nuclei, which was conducive to the formation of uniform ZnTe microspheres. Excessive PVP would form excessively high coverage for the crystal nuclei, resulting in a microstructure with increased and inhomogeneous dimensions, so PVP is a key factor to control the growth direction and uniformity.27,33,34 Based on the above results, 0.2 g PVP was the best choice for preparing ZnTe microspheres of uniform size.

Effect of temperature
According to comparative experiments, the temperature was also found as an important parameter that affected the morphology of the products. For this reason, we designed the synthesis experiments at 150 °C (Fig. 6) and 180 °C (Fig. 2(b)), setting the other reaction conditions as in the experimental section: 0.2 g PVP, 1.2 g NaOH, 1 mL N2H4·H2O, and 2.0 mL ZnCl2 solution (300 mM) for 18 h. As shown in Fig. 6, the morphology of the products was uneven, some individual morphologies were incomplete, the surface of the balls had holes and the spheres composed of nanoparticles were not dense. It is well known that the lower the temperature, the higher the viscosity of the solution and the poorer the mobility of the primary nanoparticles in solution. Moreover, the reaction at a higher temperature will result in a higher concentration of Te monomer generated in the initial nucleation stage, which is conducive to kinetic growth, which is a necessary condition for the formation of more uniform microspheres. The ZnTe microspheres were formed by the primary nanoparticles in solution through the directional attachment mechanism, which also results in a non-uniform ZnTe microsphere size at low temperature with holes on the surface and individual incompleteness. Therefore, we believe that the lower reaction temperature is not conducive to the formation of uniform ZnTe microspheres.

Growth mechanism of the ZnTe microspheres
According to the above discussion, the formation of the ZnTe microspheres can be divided into two steps: (1) primary nanoparticles with a diameter of several tens of nanometers were obtained by nucleation and growth in solution; (2) uniform ZnTe microspheres were formed by the primary nanoparticles through the directional attachment mechanism.
For the first step, primary ZnTe nanoparticles were obtained in the solution. Specifically, N2H4·H2O was used for the reducing agent because it has strong reducibility, especially in alkaline solutions.35–37 Therefore, NaOH was added as an alkaline environment provider. Under alkaline conditions, the formation of ZnTe may undergo the following reactions: TeO32− + 3H2O + 4e− → Te + 6OH− (Eθ1 = −0.57 V)(2) Te + 2e− → Te2− (Eθ2 = −1.143 V)(3) Zn(OH)2 + 2e− → Zn + 2OH− (Eθ3 = −1.249)(4)
We analyzed it based on the standard electrode potential of the reaction. It is obvious that the reduction potential has the following sequence: Eθ1 > Eθ2 > Eθ3. As we all know, the greater the reduction potential, the easier the reaction proceeds. Therefore, theoretically speaking, after the reaction (3) has completely occurred, the reaction (4) may begin to proceed. That is to say, under the standard conditions, Zn2+ can hardly be reduced to get Zn(0). Hence, we suggest that the reaction formula for the formation of ZnTe crystal nuclei is: Zn2+ + Te2− →ZnTe, instead of the reaction: Zn0 + Te0 → ZnTe. This is consistent with the reaction mechanism of Wu et al.38
Based on the above speculation, the formation mechanism of ZnTe primary nanoparticles is as follows: at the initial stage, Na2TeO3 was decomposed and reduced by N2H4·H2O in the solution to form Te(0). Subsequently, the Te(0) was further reduced to Te2− ions. Finally, the Te2− ions combined with the Zn2+ ions in the solution to form ZnTe crystal nuclei and then grew to ZnTe nanocrystals with a size of several tens of nanometers.
For the second step, uniform ZnTe microspheres were formed through the directional attachment mechanism. The “directional attachment” mechanism is to attach primary nanoparticles together in a highly oriented and irreversible way to obtain secondary polycrystalline particles. The primary nanoparticles themselves can be used as the basic structural unit to prepare complex-shaped micro/nanostructures.39–41 Under the experimental conditions, the particle size of the ZnTe microspheres was about 1.7 μm, while the average size of the primary ZnTe nanoparticles calculated by the Scherrer formula was 35.5 nm, which just verified the rationality of the directional attachment mechanism. The growth of the ZnTe crystal nuclei and the primary nanoparticles had always been throughout the entire reaction process, expanding and growing in the inner space of the sphere and filling the entire sphere, making the combination between the primary nanoparticles closer. Under this mechanism, smaller primary nanoparticles can form larger particles through a directional attachment mechanism, the size of which can reach the micron level, where adjacent nanoparticles self-assemble by sharing a common crystal orientation and docking of these particles at planar interfaces.42 From a thermodynamic point of view, this mechanism will eliminate the high-energy surface and cause a large reduction in surface free energy to provide a driving force for spontaneous directional attachment.
So, we suggest that the growth process of ZnTe microspheres can be described by the process shown in Fig. 7. The process of ZnTe microsphere formation can be divided into the following four steps: (1) a large number of ZnTe crystal nuclei were produced in the solution; (2) The ZnTe crystal nuclei quickly grew into small primary nanoparticles; (3) The primary nanoparticles aggregated and grew larger; (4) The ZnTe microspheres were form through the directional attachment mechanism. However, these four steps usually develop in parallel in the whole reaction process. In other words, it is difficult for us to distinguish the previous and subsequent growth for nodes at a certain time. Although it is very important to understand the state of various particles in the reactor at any time, it is difficult to realize this process because of the sealing characteristics of the solvothermal reaction in this study.

Band gap calculation of ZnTe microspheres
The optical characteristics of the ZnTe microsphere powder were measured by UV-4802s in the wavelength range of 350–800 nm at room temperature. Fig. 8 is the Tauc plot drawn by analyzing the absorption spectrum of the ZnTe microspheres using the Tauc method, which was used to calculate the optical band gap (Eg) of ZnTe. For semiconductor materials, the relationship between optical band gap and absorption coefficient is: (αhν)1/n = A(hν − Eg)(5)where α is the molar absorption coefficient, h is the Planck constant, ν is the incident photon frequency, A is the proportionality constant, Eg is the optical band gap of the semiconductor material, and ZnTe is the direct band gap semiconductor material, so the value of n is 1/2. The Tauc plot in Fig. 8 shows the relationship between (αhν)2 and (hν). When the value of y (αhν)2 = 0, the tangent of the reverse extension curve intersects the X axis, and the Eg value of the ZnTe microspheres is about 2.14 eV. It is closer to the previous literature.23

Photoelectrical properties of the ZnTe microspheres
ZnTe is a wide bandgap semiconductor material with a bandgap width within the range of green light, which theoretically allows it to respond well to green light. We also found that the optoelectronic properties of ZnTe nanomaterials have not been well studied so far. Therefore, we tested the photoelectric properties of the photodetector based on ZnTe microspheres using a green laser at the wavelength of 535 nm as a light source under room temperature, and the results were shown in Fig. 9. The ethanol dispersion of ZnTe microspheres was dropped on the interdigital electrode to prepare the photoelectric detector with a distance of approximately 90 μm between the gold electrodes. The interdigital electrode is shown in illustration 1 of Fig. 9(a), and then the photoelectric detector was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 1 h. During the test, the vacuum degree in the sample chamber was lower than 1.0 × 10−4 Pa. All tests were carried out at room temperature. The light source adopted an intermittent illumination method, and the light source switch cycle was 4 s. The I–V curve of a photodetector based on ZnTe microspheres under dark conditions is shown in Fig. 9(a). The reason for the non-linear I–V curve may be that the size of the microspheres is too large and the contact between the spherical shape and the gold electrodes of the interdigital electrode is not good. Therefore, it cannot be shown as an ohmic contact. When the photodetector was illuminated by green light, the photogenerated carriers (electrons and holes) generated in the film migrate in two different directions under the action of external bias, finally the photoresponsive current signal is detected in the external circuit. As shown in Fig. 9(b), the ZnTe microsphere photodetector showed an obvious photoelectric signal and good stability under +5 V bias voltage and 100 mW laser power. Under the irradiation of a green laser, the ZnTe microsphere film produces a large number of photogenerated electrons and holes, which move backward under the action of an electric field, resulting in significantly lower film resistance and higher output current. Under dark conditions, the dark current was stable at 0.4062 μA. The photoresponse current ΔI was defined as the current difference between laser irradiation (Ip) and dark (Id) conditions.43 Under a bias voltage of +5.0 V and laser power of 100 mW, the photocurrent of the photodetector was stable at 0.5130 μA, and ΔI is 0.1068 μA. The responsivity RI of the device can be calculated by RI = ΔI/P, where P is the laser power irradiated on the interdigital electrode. Illustration 2 of Fig. 9(a) was the simulation diagram of the interdigital electrode irradiated by a laser spot. It was concluded that the effective light receiving area was 15.9% of the spot area through calculation. In this study, the RI of the photodetector can reach 6.72 μA W−1. The response time is another important factor to characterize the photoelectric performance, which is usually characterized by the rise time and decay time. The rise time can be defined as the time required for the current to reach 63% of the maximum light response current, and the decay time can be defined as the time required for the current to reach 37% of the maximum light response current.44 By further analysis of the first switch cycle in Fig. 9(b), the rise time was 96.93 ms and the attenuation time was 103.57 ms. The fast response time reflects that ZnTe nanomaterials have high sensitivity under laser irradiation with a wavelength close to the band gap width.

The inset in (a) shows the interdigital electrodes and the schematic of the testing circuit used in this study. (b) Time dependent photocurrent response to 535 nm pulsed incident light with a period of 4 s, laser power of 100 mW and bias voltages of +5.0 V. 
The change of photocurrent with incident light power is shown in Fig. 10. The incident light wavelength was 450 nm, the spot diameter was 0.4 cm, and the laser powers were 20 mW, 40 mW, 60 mW, 80 mW and 100 mW, respectively. The bias voltage was +5 V. As shown in Fig. 10, the device shows obvious and stable switching characteristics under the irradiation of a blue laser with different powers and a bias voltage of +5.0 V. As the optical power density increased from 40 mW cm−2 to 200 mW cm−2, the photocurrent increased from 416.57 μA to 499.20 μA due to the number of photogenerated carriers increasing at higher laser power. The photocurrent increases nonlinearly with the increase of incident power P as seen in the illustration of Fig. 10(a). The response time of the photodetector under laser irradiation with a wavelength of 450 nm can be obtained from the first switch cycle diagram amplified in Fig. 10(a) with a laser power of 20 mW. As shown in Fig. 10(b), the rise time and decay time of the photodetector were 91.8 ms and 115.50 ms, respectively.

Conclusions
In summary, ZnTe microspheres through the PVP-assisted solvothermal method were successfully synthesized. PVP acted as a surfactant in the experiment and adhered to the surface of the microstructure and cannot be washed off by deionized water and absolute ethanol. Using an appropriate amount of PVP, ZnTe microspheres with uniform size can be obtained. Under the experimental conditions (1.2 g NaOH, 0.2 g PVP and 180 °C), ZnTe microspheres with uniform size (∼1.7 μm) were obtained, and the average grain size of the primary nanoparticles was 35.5 nm. The primary nanoparticles were generated by the growth of ZnTe crystal nuclei, then forming ZnTe microspheres through the directional attachment mechanism, and the primary nanoparticles were highly tightly bound. The optical bandgap of the ZnTe microspheres was estimated to be around 2.14 eV.
The photoelectric properties of the ZnTe microsphere photodetector were studied at room temperature. Under the irradiation of 535 nm pulse incoming light, the laser power of 100 mW, and the bias voltage of +5.0 V, the photocurrent and responsivity of the photodetector were 0.1068 μA and 6.72 μA W−1, respectively. The rise and decay times of the device were 96.93 ms and 103.57 ms, respectively. In addition, the relationship between photocurrent and incident light power under 450 nm pulse incident light was also studied. The photocurrent increases nonlinearly with the increase of the incident power. The rise and decay times of the device under this condition were 91.8 ms and 115.50 ms, respectively. This research provides a solution to the bottleneck problem of liquid-phase synthesis of micro- and nanomaterials in high-speed optoelectronic devices.
