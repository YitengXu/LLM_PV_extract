    , Accepted 29th May 2018First published on 31st May 2018AbstractHere we present a comprehensive study on the photophysics of QDs–fullerene blends, aiming to elucidate the impact of ligands on the extraction of carriers from QDs. We investigated how three different ligands (oleylamine, octadecanethiol and propanethiol) influence the dynamics of charge generation, separation, and recombination in blends of CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs and PCBM. We accessed each relevant process directly by combining the results from both optical and magnetic spectroscopies. Transient absorption measurements revealed a faster interaction dynamics in thiol-capped ligands. Through phenomenological modeling of the interaction processes, i.e., energy transfer and electron transfer, we estimated the suppression of exciton migration and the enhancement of electron transfer processes when alkyl–thiols are employed as ligands. Contextually, we report the profound impact of the ligands’ alkyl chain length, leading to strengthened interactions with PCBM acceptors. Quantitatively, we measured a 10-fold increase in the electron transfer rate when oleylamine ligands were exchanged with propanethiol ligands. EPR spectroscopy gave access to subtle details regarding both the enhanced charge generation and lower binding energy of charge-transfer states in blends compared to PCBM alone. Moreover, through pulsed EPR techniques, we inferred the localization of deep electron traps in localized sites close to QDs in the blends. Therefore, our thorough characterization evidenced the essential role of ligands in determining QD interactions. We believe that these discoveries will contribute to the efficient incorporation of QDs in existing organic PV technologies.
1 Introduction
In the burgeoning field of quantum dots based solar cells (QDSCs), the unconventional photophysics of quantum dots (QDs) is exploited to achieve higher solar conversion efficiencies. The intriguing concurrence of broadband visible absorptions, high extinction coefficients, and energy level tunability through size control offers unprecedented tools for harnessing sunlight.1–3 On top of that, the possibility to create multiple excitons by a single high-energy photon absorption, through carrier multiplication, and the role of Auger recombination processes in promoting non-Marcus charge transfer behavior, hold promises to boost solar cell device efficiencies.4–8 Also, since the rise of nanostructured hybrid perovskite materials as a game-changer in the photovoltaic field, the prospects are even brighter.9–11
The main impairments that dictate current research directions stem from QDs photophysics as well. Due to their excitonic nature, QDSCs are affected by low charge mobility and exciton migration issues.12,13 Therefore, many research efforts were spent in the quest for an exciton-separating interface.
Among the different configurations of QDSC, Schottky heterojunction solar cells (SHJSC) and QD sensitized solar cells (QDSSC) attained impressively fast-growing efficiencies.14–17 In SHJSC and QDSSC, charge separation is obtained at the oxide–QDs interfaces. On the other hand, the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) configuration exploits organic-QDs exciton-separating interfaces. A seminal paper by Alivisatos in early 2000 focused on the role of polymer–QDs charge transfer interactions, resulting in polymer:QDs blends reaching a 2% power conversion efficiency.18 The dynamics of interactions within these blends have been explained recently by transient optical measurements for PbS QDs.19 The introduction of ternary hybrid solar cells (polymer:QDs:fullerene) raised the interest in incorporating QDs in BHJ solar cells.20–23 In recent years, the role of fullerene derivatives in promoting photo-induced electron transfer (eT) gained increasing attention. The eT interaction between QDs and fullerenes was investigated, realizing covalently bound dyads by Kamat.24 The charge generation in C60–QDs blends was also observed by electrochemical and photocurrent measurements and by steady-state light-induced electron paramagnetic resonance (LEPR).21,25,26 Nevertheless, to our knowledge, one single work reported the photophysical characterization of hybrid films embedding QDs, prototypical to QD-based BHJ devices, urging further investigations on the role of surfaces and ligands.27
Therefore, we recognize a gap in the tailoring and characterization of through-space QDs:PCBM interactions. We studied these systems with a twofold aim: to track the dynamics of charge generation, separation, and recombination in QDs:PCBM blends and consequently to engineer interactions exploiting the surface chemistry of QDs. We investigated the interaction dynamics of thin shell quasi-type II QDs (CdSe/CdS) with fullerene derivatives (PCBM) in a prototypical BHJ active layer. The present work combines optical and magnetic spectroscopies to unveil charge generation and recombination events on a broad time window. Charge generation events are studied on femto- and picosecond time scales using transient absorption (TA) measurements. The fate of photo-generated charges is monitored on time scales ranging from nano- to milliseconds using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques. Our combined approach gives access to an unequivocal identification of charge separation and recombination events. Finally, taking advantage of QDs’ surface chemistry, we modified the ligand layers, obtaining a more efficient charge separation and a reduced competitive energy migration at the QDs–PCBM interface.
2 Experimental
2.1 Quantum dots synthesis
CdSe cores and successive CdS shells were synthesized according to previously published procedures. In particular, CdSe cores were prepared following a slightly modified method described by van Embden et al.28 Thin shell growth was achieved using a modified SILAR protocol that has been previously published.29 The resulting CdSe/CdS QDs were capped with oleylamine and dispersed in toluene. According to STEM measurements (Fig. SI10†), the radius of the QDs is estimated to be DQDs = 2.2 ± 0.4 nm. Full characterization of these samples is reported in detail elsewhere.30
2.2 Sample preparation
Blend films were prepared using a spin coating technique on transparent mylar substrates. Concentrated QD solutions in toluene (100 μM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) solutions in ortho-dichloro-benzene (oDCB) at different concentrations (20, 10, and 6 mM) were mixed in equal amounts to obtain the mixed solution. 30 μL of this solution were spin coated at 200 rpm for 15 s to achieve a homogeneous coating and then 1500 rpm for 30 s to attain complete solvent evaporation. Solution measurements were performed on diluted QD-toluene dispersions (OD ≈ 0.3) in optical quartz cuvettes with a 1 mm optical path.
2.3 Transient absorption measurements
TA measurements were performed using a home-built pump–probe setup. Pump and probe beams were generated by an amplified Ti:Sapphire laser (SpitFire, Spectra Physics) seeded by a femtosecond pulsed Ti:Sapphire oscillator (Mai-Tai, Spectra Physics). The pulse repetition rate of the SpitFire was set at 500 Hz, with a 120 fs pulse duration and λ = 400 nm obtained via a second harmonic generation in a BBO thin crystal. The probe beam was converted into white light probe pulses by super-continuum white light generation (SWLG) in a thin sapphire plate, whereas the pump fluence was tuned using a set of OD filters. To achieve a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio, the pump fluence was set to j = 0.245 mJ cm−2. The average exciton occupancy, obtained as the product of pump fluence j and absorption cross section σ, was 〈N〉 = j × σ = 2. The collimated pump pulse and focused probe pulse hit the samples in the overlapping region. The delay between pump and probe pulses was controlled with a motorized linear stage. TA spectra were recorded in 1 ps steps. The transmitted light was dispersed and directed to a linear CMOS diode array. The quality of the TA signal, i.e., ΔA values (differential absorption), was improved through repeated measurements and averaging (250 measurements were averaged to obtain a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio). The obtained spectra were numerically processed to minimize noise and white light chirping effects, by using a homemade Matlab routine. The routine applies a low-pass filter and a polynomial correction for t0 determination.
2.4 EPR measurements
All the EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Elexsys E580 X-band spectrometer, equipped with an Oxford ER4112HV cryostat for sample temperature control. Light induced EPR (LEPR) spectra were acquired using white light illumination from a 300 W xenon lamp, IR filtered and focused onto a quartz optical fiber ending in front of the optical access of the EPR spectrometer cavity. The system delivered about 50 mW cm−2 of light irradiance to the sample. Typical LEPR experimental parameters were a modulation amplitude of 1 G and a microwave power 0.2 mW.
Time-resolved EPR (TREPR) experiments were performed recording the EPR signal after a short laser pulse produced by a Nd:YAG, Quantel Brilliant pulsed laser (λ = 532 nm, pulse length = 5 ns; E/pulse = 5 mJ, 50 Hz repetition rate). The TREPR signal was recorded through a LeCroy LT344 digital oscilloscope. The spectra were acquired with 2 mW microwave power and averaging 200 transient signals at each field position.
Electron spin relaxation times T1 and T2 were measured using the Inversion Recovery and Hahn Echo Decay pulse sequences, with π/2 and π pulse lengths of 16–32 ns.
EPR measurements were performed on films of neat PCBM and films of QDs:PCBM blends. For the neat PCBM films, a 1 mg mL−1 solution of PCBM in oDCB was prepared, whereas for the blends, PCBM solutions in oDCB (2 mg mL−1) were mixed with an equal volume of Quantum Dot solutions in toluene. The final solutions were poured inside an EPR quartz tube and evaporated under vacuum, leaving a thick film on the inner tube wall. The EPR tubes were successively sealed under vacuum. EPR spectral simulations were carried out using the routines of Easyspin, a Matlab™ toolbox.
3 Results
Oleylamine (OLA, N-18) capped CdSe/CdS QDs in toluene solution were synthesized as described in the Experimental section. We chose this particular type of dot as the donor material owing to the quasi-type II character. Indeed, due to the peculiar band alignment of these heterostructures, the photoexcited electron wavefunction reaches the surface of the QD, thereby prompting wavefunction overlap in the interaction processes.31 On the other hand, growing a shell contributes to passivate the surface dangling bonds, which act as traps.32 Therefore, thin shell CdSe/CdS QDs provide the best balance between passivation and electronic state accessibility. Starting from the as-synthesized CdSe/CdS QDs, we exchanged a native amine ligand by an alkanethiol molecule, propanethiol (PT, S-3) or octadecanethiol (ODT, S-18). This ligand-exchange procedure takes advantage of the different binding ability of thiols and amines to a CdS surface, according to HSAB theory for an X-type ligand.33,34 We performed ligand exchange by adding excess ligand (PT and ODT) to an aliquot of native ligand QDs. We purified ligand-exchanged QDs by precipitating them with an acetone:methanol (1:1) mixture and re-dispersing them in toluene. We monitored and confirmed the ligand exchange reaction by both optical and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. As shown in Fig. SI2,† PL is extremely sensitive to thiol binding, due to the thiol-mediated hole trapping process becoming dominant over radiative recombination. Indeed, the redox thiol levels lay above the valence band of CdSe-based QDs. According to Scholes and Minotto, this promotes exciton trapping via a band-edge charge transfer process.35,36 The drastic changes of PL after ligand-exchange mostly concern emission efficiencies, whereas the band shape and, therefore, the nature of the emissive states is unvaried. Quantitatively, the PL quantum yield (PLQY) drops from 10 ± 1% to 1 ± 0.2% and 1 ± 0.1%, respectively, for OLA-capped CdSe/CdS (N-18), PT-capped CdSe/CdS (S-3) and ODT-capped CdSe/CdS (S-18) ligands. Besides optical spectroscopy, we obtained direct evidence of ligand exchange using 1H-NMR spectroscopy (Fig. SI1†). The recorded 1H-NMR spectra are characterized by broad linewidths, associated with the slow motional dynamics of the bound ligands.33 After the ligand exchange procedure, OLA characteristic peaks (at 5.35 ppm and 2.02 ppm) are quantitatively replaced by those of PT and ODT (at 1.60 ppm). These results further confirm the effectiveness of the ligand exchange.
We investigated the excited state dynamics of our samples on a picosecond timescale by TA spectroscopy. This technique is extensively used to access the temporal evolution of exciton populations in nanostructures. The analysis of the 2D TA maps is based on the inspection of both spectral structures (i.e., the fixed time section of 2D maps) and transients (i.e., the fixed wavelength section of 2D maps). The rich QD excitonic structure gives rise to many TA signals. In Fig. 1a, we report the spectral structures of our samples in toluene solution, recorded 2 ps after photoexcitation. A comparison between the normalized signals reveals similar spectral structures, except for the A2 and B3 signals. These signals result from the combination of bleaching and excited state absorption associated with the |1P > (1Pe–1P3/2) exciton transition.37 Unfortunately, the bleaching band related to CdS absorption overlaps with the B3 signal.31 Ligand exchange with thiols is expected to increase the number of Cd–S atomic units at the surface, thereby resulting in enhanced CdS bleaching. Although its shape persists, the A2 signal is shifted to negative values. Still, we attribute this effect to the enhanced B3 bleaching concealing the A2 signal. To quantify the different excited state dynamics, we focused on B1 transients. The B1 signal (i.e., the |1S> ground state bleaching or 1Se–1S3/2 exciton transition) is the most widely investigated signal in the literature of QDs.38,39 Due to the asymmetry in the electron and hole density of states, this signal was found to be sensitive to the electron population only.38 Thence, B1 is a useful probe for electron transfer processes, and our research will focus on this signal. In Fig. 1b, we report a comparison between normalized B1 transients. Multi-exponential fitting results and average lifetimes are reported in Table 1. As confirmed by fitting, it is possible to distinguish a short-time and a long-time region in the QD recombination dynamics in solution.

Generally, during TA measurements multi-excitons are generated (see Methods), hence the short time region of bleaching recovery is mostly related to Auger recombination and ultrafast exciton trapping.39,40 On the other hand, the long-time region is related to single exciton or trion species recombinations.41 Henceforth, these processes will be referred to as intrinsic recombinations. The B1 bleaching recovery is slowed down when QDs are capped with alkyl–thiol ligands. According to PL data, trapping processes underlie these changes. As mentioned earlier, thiols ligands promote hole trapping processes. The reduced electron–hole overlap when holes are trapped abates Auger recombinations and results in longer bleaching recovery.42
Pristine (N-18) and ligand-exchanged QDs (S-18, S-3) blended with PCBM were deposited as thin films by spin coating on transparent polymer substrates. We systematically varied the concentration of QDs (0.5%, 1%, 1.6% molar ratio) in our blends. For each QDs (N-18, S-18, and S-3) we spin-deposited three blends at those concentrations. QDs concentration was kept low, to obtain good quality thin-films. We inferred the morphology of these films by performing scanning transmission electron microscopy measurements on blends drop-casted on TEM grids. As shown in Fig. SI10,† these blends comprise both domains of QDs and PCBM, and mixed regions. Although both the deposition method and the substrate are different, these measurements show the limited miscibility of QDs and PCBM.
Due to a complete PL quenching, we measured the excited state dynamics by TA measurements. The size of these domains is much smaller than the probe beam waist (300 μm), and therefore measurements are indicative of the average dynamics inside these blends. In Fig. 2a and the ESI,† we report the comparison between spectral structures and B1 transients in solution and in blends with PCBM, at a 1% QD concentration. In the blends, the spectral structures are red shifted by few nanometers, and the relative amplitudes of A2 and B3 signals are modified. This evidence underlines that a significant interaction between the QDs and PCBM is present in the blends.
 Fig. 2  (a) Comparison between B1 transients of QDs in toluene solution and blend (1% QDs). Grey squares represent each solution transient. Transients N-18 (green), S-18 (blue) and S-3 (red) are fitted by multi-exponential function (solid line). (b) Concentration dependence of B1 transients for S-3 blends. The difference between 0.5% QDs (orange) and 1% QDs (red) is more marked than those between 1% QDs and 1.6% QDs (brown). 
From the TA transients, we extracted clear signatures of the QDs–PCBM interaction. As shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1, we observe a shortening of the bleaching recovery time when QDs interact with PCBM. Noteworthy, we could not find a long-living asymptote of B1 transients for QDs in the blends, as observed in solution. The bleaching signal almost wholly recovers in the time-window of Fig. 2b, demonstrating a fast and complete depopulation of the QD excited state. Although this effect is significant for the N-18 and S-18 samples, drastic changes are observed for the S-3 sample.
Noteworthy, B1 recoveries in blends outpace those observed in solution, as shown in Fig. 2. As discussed above, a fast B1 bleaching recovery identifies a rapid depopulation of the 1Se electron state, thereby confirming the presence of a picosecond timescale interaction in our hybrid films. Moreover, the quantitative analysis of these transients disclosed more subtle details. The fitting of the bleaching recovery of N-18 blends requires a bi-exponential decay function, whereas S-18 and S-3 blends display mono-exponential decays. The mono-exponential decay is indicative of the presence of a single photophysical process, driving energy relaxation in the QDs. A qualitative comparison between S-3, S-18, and N-18 discloses the pivotal role played by alkyl chain length in modulating the through-space interactions between QDs and PCBM. Indeed, although the S-18 bleaching recovers on a timescale comparable to that of N-18, S-3 shows a faster recovery, thereby indicating an enhanced interaction. We stress the fact that the ratio Q (Table 1) between the internal recombination rates and the interaction rate plays a pivotal role in defining the interaction efficiency. The presence of a single exponential in S-3 and S-18 suggests that all internal recombinations are replaced by a unique, and therefore very efficient, interaction process, whose time scale is determined by the alkyl ligand length. In Fig. 2b, we show the concentration-dependent behavior of the B1 transient for S-3 blends. Bleaching recoveries are observed to slow down when the QD concentration is increased. The same behavior is observed for other blends (Table 1). A possible rationalization invokes the number of acceptors for the interaction processes. Indeed, the [PCBM]/[QDs] molar concentration ratio establishes an average number of acceptors for each QD; with decreasing this ratio we expect an increase of the overall interaction time. Although the reduction from 0.5% to 1% is consistent, that from 1% to 1.6% is small. This indicates the presence of a threshold, above which we cannot neglect inter-QD interactions in blends induced by aggregation. A similar behavior is observed for the N-18 and S-18 blends, as reported in Table 1.
Recently, the coexistence of electronic energy transfer (EET) and electron transfer (eT) was studied in covalent QDs–PCBM dyads.43 Unfortunately, we are not able to discriminate between these interaction processes from optical transients alone. Indeed, both energy and electron transfer cause depopulation of the 1Se electron state probed by the B1 transient. To get a direct view of the nature of the interaction process, we used EPR techniques. Light-induced EPR (LEPR) detects long-living paramagnetic species generated after UV-vis light absorption. The LEPR spectra (light ON minus dark) recorded in the neat PCBM film and the three QDs:PCBM blends at 80 K are reported in Fig. 3. Before illumination (dark) no EPR signal is appreciable in any sample, while under illumination (light ON) a sharp EPR signal with a g-factor (g = 1.9998 ± 0.0005) and anisotropic lineshape typical of the stable radical anion localized on PCBM is detected. The counterpart signal, corresponding to a radical cation localized on the QD, is not visible, probably as a result of severe line broadening due to the fast magnetic relaxation times.21,44,45 Therefore, we have a direct confirmation that the interaction between QDs and PCBM induces a photoinduced electron transfer from the QD towards PCBM.
 Fig. 3  LEPR spectra of the PCBM film (orange), N-18:PCBM (red), S-18:PCBM (brown) and S-3:PCBM (black) acquired at 80 K. The spectra shown are the difference between spectra recorded under illumination of the sample using vis light (light ON) and those recorded before sample illumination (dark). 
Further insights on the fate of photo-generated carriers are provided by variable temperature LEPR spectra of the four samples. We recorded the LEPR spectra at three different temperatures: 130 K, 160 K, and 190 K (see Fig. SI7†). The above-discussed LEPR intensity trend persists at all temperatures, evidencing the unvaried role of QD ligands. With increasing temperatures, the LEPR signal decreases until it almost disappears at 190 K, on account of both the Curie law and the shorter lifetime of the photo-generated charge carriers.
Different photo-physical processes, such as charge separation and recombination, compete in determining the fate of the photo-generated carriers.46,47 Time-Resolved EPR (TREPR) with a microsecond time resolution gives access to useful information on these processes. The TREPR spectra of the S-3:PCBM blend acquired at 80 K (a) and 130 K (b) and their simulations are reported in Fig. 4. These spectra are composed of a broad band extending for about 200 Gauss, in enhanced absorption at lower fields and emission at higher fields. The broad linewidth, the peculiar emissive/absorptive character, and the field position are features commonly observed in TREPR spectra of the photoexcited triplet state of PCBM.46,48 The spectroscopic parameters obtained by best-fit spectral simulation confirm this hypothesis49 (see Table SI2†).
 Fig. 4  TREPR spectra of S-3:PCBM recorded 1 μs after a 532 nm laser pulse (dark line) and best-fit spectra (red line) at (a) 80 K and (b) 130 K. The ISC triplet (dashed green line) and Recombination Triplet (dashed orange line) fit contributions are also reported. Abs = Absorption, Em = Emission. 
The emissive/absorptive character of the TREPR spectra results from non-equilibrium populations of spin sublevels and contains a wealth of information on processes contributing to the triplet populations. The excited triplet state generation processes are mainly: (a) Intersystem Crossing (ISC) from the excited singlet state and (b) geminate recombination of the charge carriers (radical ion pair recombination). Therefore, the enhanced absorption and emission character observed is interpreted as a sum of these two contributions.
The contribution of the ISC population depends on the presence of the singlet excited states of PCBM that undergo singlet to triplet conversion. On the other hand, the recombination population indicates the presence of photo-generated charge transfer states (CT) that recombine within a few nanoseconds (geminate recombination). The spectral simulation reveals a different relative weight of the two contributions at 80 K or 130 K. In particular, at 80 K the recombination mechanism is more effective with respect to 130 K. From this evidence, we infer that the charge separation process, competitive with geminate recombination, is a thermally activated process and at lower temperatures, fewer charge carriers manage to overcome the Coulomb attraction barrier, therefore, favoring geminate recombination. The result is confirmed in all the QDs:PCBM samples (Fig. SI8 and Table SI1†) where the recombination mechanism contribution is significant at 80 K and strikingly decreases at 130 K.
Conversely, the neat PCBM film shows a substantial recombination contribution even at 130 K and at higher temperatures (data not reported). This evidence demonstrates that the CdSe QDs influence not only the electron transfer process but also the charge recombination and separation mechanisms.
To complete the photophysical scenario and investigate the chemical environment of the PCBM anion50 we performed Inversion Recovery, and Hahn Echo Decay pulsed EPR experiments, under UV-Vis light illumination. Through these experiments, we accessed both electron spin–lattice (T1) and spin–spin (T2) relaxation times of the photogenerated PCBM anion in the three blends and neat PCBM film.
In Fig. SI9,† the T1 and T2 curves and multi-exponential best-fit lines for the S-3:PCBM blend are reported as an example. The same procedure has been carried out for all the samples. The electron spin relaxation times obtained from the bi-exponential fitting of the T1 curve and the single exponential fitting of the T2 curve are reported in Table 2.

We observe a significant decrease of T1 and T2 for the three blends in comparison with the neat PCBM film. This result suggests that long-living PCBM anions within the blends are localized in short proximity (<1 nm) of the QDs, whose magnetic nuclei and orbital moments contribute to shortening their spin relaxation times.
4 Discussion
4.1 Charge generation
Hitherto, only a few studies reported electron transfer between covalently linked CdSe and C60 derivatives.24,43 The high electron affinity of PCBM (−3.9 eV)51 is compatible with eT process at the interface with CdSe QDs (−3.1 eV, estimated for a 2.1 nm radius from the literature52). As mentioned in the Introduction, a peculiar eT mechanism was recently proposed for QDs. Auger-assisted electron transfer allows circumventing of the typical Marcus inverted region, thanks to the assistance of Auger processes in storing energy exceeding the reorganization energy. Consistent with the estimated energy levels, we found our QDs–PCBM couple to be in the Auger-assisted regime,24,43 being (−ΔG[∼800 meV]>λ[∼400 meV]). Alongside with eT, the energetics of the systems support the possibility of having an EET between the QDs and PCBM. As shown in Fig. SI5,† the spectral overlap between QD emission and PCBM broad absorption bands is non-negligible.
Using surface chemistry, we aimed at tuning the interaction between CdSe/CdS QDs and PBCM and direct it toward eT, thereby suppressing the EET contributions. Exchanging ligands acts on two essential factors determining the charge generation: (1) the distance between QD electron-donor and PCBM electron-acceptor, (2) the nature of excitons in QDs. The length of the ligand alkyl chain determines the minimum donor–acceptor distance within blends. At shorter ligand lengths, the eT rate is expected to prevail over the EET rate, due to different distance dependences.53 We estimated from the literature the close packing distances for PT and ODT/OLA ligands as 0.4 nm and 1.7 nm, respectively.54,55 Moreover, the optical characterization of ligand-exchanged QDs suggests a different nature of exciton in thiol-capped QDs as compared with amine-capped ones. The presence of redox levels above the valence band gives rise to a Type-II hetero-interface. The drastic decrease of PL efficiency, according to the literature,32,56,57 suggests a hole trapping quenching mechanism. TA data further confirm this: the modification in the B1 transients is indicative of hot-hole trapping.58 Therefore, thiol ligands should reduce the energetic barrier arising from Coulomb exciton binding and therefore promote charge generation.
Experimental results on charge generation reveal that our surface chemistry approach successfully targeted the interaction between QDs and PCBM toward eT. Indeed, the B1 bleaching recovery is faster for S-3 compared to S-18 and N-18. Moreover, S-3 and S-18 exhibit mono-exponential decay, indicating the presence of a single contribution driving the interaction.
The suppression of EET is demonstrated by calculation of the theoretical EET rate, based on independent measurements of spectral overlap and QD fluorescence lifetimes. EET is an interaction process, mediated by intermolecular forces, in which a photo-excited donor relaxes by transferring excitation to a nearby acceptor system.59 In the weak-coupling regime for QD systems, EET is described by the Förster model, in which the EET rate is governed by distance, transition dipole moments and spectral overlap. The common expression for the Förster rate is  where the most important terms are the quantum yield (QY) and donor lifetime (τD), the typical r−6 distance dependence and the overlap integral between normalized donor fluorescence and acceptor absorption. According to this analysis, the intrinsic EET rates for the minimum packing distance are reported in Table 3 (see ESI†). The intrinsic EET rates should be multiplied by the average number of acceptors in the blends. Even though the considered blend is a disordered system, it is worth noting that if we consider the maximum number of PCBM acceptors allowed by the QD surface area (see ESI†), the calculated rates agree with the observed B1 transients only in the case of N-18 blends (Table 3). For S-3 and S-18, the calculated maximum global EET rates are much slower than the experimental ones. This suggests that EET is suppressed by thiol ligand exchange, in favor of the more efficient eT.

The quantitative extraction of EET and eT rates would require an accurate determination of the average number of acceptors, which would hinge on many assumptions on the blend structure affecting the accuracy of the result. Notwithstanding, the suppression of EET in favor of eT is proved by the intensity of the LEPR signals.
Indeed, LEPR reveals different charge generation efficiencies for different blends, i.e., the LEPR signal intensity scales as S-3 ≫ S-18 > N-18. Thence, both the nature of the ligand and the length of the alkyl chain do influence the electron transfer process, though to different extents. We speculate that the possible exciton pre-dissociation, by way of hole trapping, in the QDs would promote electron transfer. Nevertheless, the alkyl chain length of the ligands plays a central role in the increased charge generation. Consequently, surface chemistry provides a fundamental tool in manipulating and tailoring the interactions of QDs in blends.
4.2 Charge separation vs. geminate recombination
Following electron transfer, a large variety of processes can occur within photoactive blends.60,61 Photoinduced electron transfer from QDs to PCBM generates a Charge-Transfer State (CT state) whose charges are localized on adjacent species (cation on the QDs and anion on the PCBM molecule). The CT complex can either dissociate into free charges (Charge-Separated State, CS State), where the Coulomb attraction between the charges is significantly lower than kBT, or it can geminately recombine following many roads, such as a direct transition to the ground state or the donor (or acceptor) triplet excited state. The generation of a CS state requires overcoming the Coulomb attraction between cations and anions. We performed a rough estimate of the Coulomb binding energy (BE) of the CT state considering the dielectric constants of the various blends and the distances between the charge carriers. In the QDs:PCBM blend, a Maxwell–Garnett approximation was used to estimate the effective dielectric constant of the mixture.62 We determined that the ratio BEPCBM/BEQDs:PCBM can range from 2.5 to 4. The uncertainty stems from difficulties in precisely evaluating the size-dependent dielectric constant of the QDs and from indefiniteness of the distance between the charges in the CT state. Nevertheless, a reduction of the Coulomb contribution to the binding energy of the CT states of QDs:PCBM blends compared to the PCBM neat film is expected. The lower binding energy of the CT state explains the partial suppression of geminate recombination observed in the TREPR spectra of QDs:PCBM blends at higher temperatures (T ≥ 130 K), where the thermally activated CT state dissociation is faster than the recombination process. For a more precise evaluation of the separation efficiency of the CT state, the combined effect of other contributions to the binding energy of the CT state should be evaluated, such as surface multipoles, dark dipole, entropy effect, hot CT state mechanism and local charge carrier dynamics.63 The combined use of TREPR and LEPR is a more direct experimental way to determine the fate of the CT state.
4.3 Trapping vs. detrapping
Trap states, defined as spatially localized states within the energy gap, generated by the system inhomogeneity, play a remarkable role in photovoltaic material performances. Therefore, the trapping of separated charge carriers results in a significant space charge generation. Temperature plays a pivotal role in determining the trap dynamics. Indeed, if the thermal energy is sufficient, a trapped charge can be de-trapped into a free state.64 In particular, at increasing temperatures both the mobility of the charges and the charge detrapping mechanism are enhanced and the encounter and recombination probability for two oppositely charge carriers increases. The LEPR spectra at various temperatures reported in Fig. SI7† verify this expectation. Indeed, the EPR signal that is generated by long-living radicals (trapped charges) decreases and nearly disappears at higher temperatures where the activation barrier for the detrapping process can be overcome, and the non-geminate recombination is enhanced.
Spin relaxation times are influenced by trap dynamics as well. In particular, since the T1 and T2 relaxation times are affected by many contributions, such as magnetic dipolar and hyperfine interactions, their measurement gives insights into the dynamics and the chemical environment of the paramagnetic species.49,65 In our case, we can consider the QDs as inhomogeneities in the PCBM phase. Therefore, energetically deeper trap states are probably localized in proximity to the QDs. Following this picture, the most stable traps are found to be close to the QDs (less than a few nanometers), where magnetic nuclei and orbital moments of the heavy atoms can contribute to shortening the T1 and T2 relaxation times of nearby spin-bearing charges. This qualitative and straightforward model follows Table 2, in which a shortening in the spin relaxation times of the PCBM anion is observed in all the QDs:PCBM blends with respect to the neat PCBM.

Fig. 5 shows a simplified picture of the primary photophysical processes governing the charge separation and recombination in QDs:PCBM blends and in neat PCBM. After the primary eT event, a charge transfer (CT) state is generated. In the neat PCBM, the CT state recombines (geminate recombination), while in QDs:PCBM blends, the charge separation is favored by the reduced binding energy between the two charges. After dissociation, the free charges can encounter trap sites in the material, generating stable long-living species that can be detected through EPR or can collide with opposite charges, producing non-geminate recombination. In the first case, the proximity of the stable charge traps to QD domains in the blends was confirmed through pulsed EPR, which reveals much shorter T1 and T2 relaxation times compared to those in the neat PCBM material.

5 Conclusions
Our investigation delved deeply into the primary photophysical processes occurring in QDs:PCBM blends over a broad timescale range (from picoseconds to few minutes). As the primary outcome, we demonstrated the possibility of finely tuning QD interactions with PCBM by acting on their surface chemistry.
A Transient absorption (TA) investigation showed an increase in the electron transfer rate from QDs functionalized with shorter ligands to PCBM, due to the exponential distance dependence of the eT donor–acceptor interaction. Contextually, thiol anchoring groups switch off the competitive EET interaction, thanks to their hole scavenging effect.
EPR analysis further corroborates the TA measurements and displays that the presence of QDs affects not only the electron transfer mechanism, but also the charge separation and recombination processes. Notably, QDs decrease the Coulomb binding energy of the radical pairs favoring their charge separation and preventing charge recombination. Besides, the pulsed EPR analysis suggests the stabilization of the photogenerated charge carriers in the proximity of QDs.
In conclusion, the incorporation of QDs into photovoltaic technology appears to be extremely lucrative, as long as the QDs’ surface chemistry is sufficiently engineered. The tailoring of QD interactions (namely, eT and EET) in photovoltaic blends is the fundamental step toward their effective integration. We expect that their use in ternary solar cells (polymer:QDs:fullerene) can potentially enhance charge generation, charge separation and ultimately conversion efficiencies in BHJ architectures.
