Here, an efficient passivation strategy using 4-diaminomethylbenzoic (4-DA) followed by thermal annealing treatment is proposed to improve the performance of PSCs. We have systemically investigated the impact of 4-DA on the physical properties of the perovskite layer and corresponding performance of the inverted PSCs. The results show that the contact between crystalline grains is improved, and high quality MAPbI3 films are successfully prepared, which result in the elimination of trap states and enhanced performance of the devices. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.58% is achieved in this work. Meanwhile, the devices show enhanced stability and the average PCE values almost remained the same after 168 hours of storage without any encapsulation. The passivation method developed in this work shows a novel strategy toward the fabrication of inverted PSCs with high efficiency and high stability.
1. Introduction
In recent years, PSCs have been extensively studied, and the PCE has been reported to be 25.2%.1 Compared with the conventional regular configuration PSCs, inverted PSCs have many advantages, such as low-temperature processes, low cost, and negligible J–V hysteresis.2–5 The perovskite film quality is very critical to the efficiency and stability of PSCs.6,7 Thus, investigations about improving the PSC device performance via the fabrication of high quality perovskite films are very necessary to the development of PSCs toward high efficiency and high stability. The electronic defects at the GBs and the surfaces of the perovskite films are very crucial to the performance of the PSCs.7–10
The defects at the GBs and surfaces are unavoidable due to the solution-based preparation method of perovskite films at low temperature.9 These defects may act as trap states to capture photogenerated carriers, leading to decreased charge transport and device performance.11,12 The defects at the GBs are considered to be a thornier problem that influences the quality of perovskite films. Firstly, dangling bonds of the GBs provide a pathway for ion migration,11,12 and the ion migration leads to decreased efficiency and serious degradation of PSCs.7,13 Secondly, the GBs are vulnerable to the exposure of heat and moisture, leading to poor stability and efficiency of the PSCs.9 Finally, obvious cracks always exist between the crystalline grains,14–16 which will induce physical and electrical decoupling between two grains, leading to short circuit in the devices. Therefore, improved stability and efficiency of PSCs can be achieved by modifying the trap states at GBs and improving the fusion between two crystalline grains in perovskite films.
The passivation method in PSCs was introduced in Huang's work, where PCBM was used as a passivation material to be filled into GBs to reduce the trap density.17 Since then, many passivation materials were widely used in PSCs.18–21 There are two kinds of defects in organic–inorganic perovskite films, positive and negative charge traps, which can be formed from I− and MA+ vacancies, respectively. Some Lewis base and acid passivation materials such as n-trioctylphosphine oxide,22 thiophene/pyridine,23 and PCBM17,24 can directly modify the charge defects by donating (or sharing) and accepting their electrons. The surface trap states can also be passivated by other kinds of materials, such as organic halide salts,19 insulating polymers,18,20 and alkylammonium halogens.21 Therefore, the passivation strategy can effectively eliminate the defects in GBs and surfaces, and some passivation materials could be filled into the gap between the crystalline grains, leading to the cross-linking effect between perovskite grains.17,21,24,25 Although the reported passivation materials have achieved good results, many of them are based on surface treatment or coating, which only passivates the surface defects. Limited success is achieved in passivating the GB defects.26,27 The passivation of the defects at GBs is still challenging based on the current passivation methods.
H. Zhu et al. reported that carboxyl groups can passivate the trap states via strong coordination with the positively charged ions (Pb2+) on the perovskite film surface27 and S. Yang et al. proposed that benzene–iodine complexes can be formed by benzene rings to passivate the trap states.26 In this work, we use a hydrophobic organic acid as the passivation material, 4-DA, which includes the above two passivation groups, carboxyl groups and benzene rings. A passivation strategy of the organic acid 4-DA combined with thermal-annealing treatment (TA) is developed to passivate both GB and surface defects. We systemically study the influence of 4-DA on the perovskite film properties and optimize the fabrication of perovskite films. The results show that this passivation method effectively reduces the trap states at GBs in the perovskite films. A high PCE of 20.58% is achieved in our inverted-structure PSCs. The modified devices also show enhanced stability, and the PCE value can retain 97% of its initial efficiency after 168 h of storage. Thus, the passivation method developed in this work shows significant potential in the preparation of inverted PSCs with high efficiency and high stability.

2.2 Device fabrication
The schematic diagrams of device structures are shown in Fig. 1a and the procedures for preparing inverted PSCs with passivation are shown in Fig. S1.† Firstly, ITO substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, detergent, distilled water and IPA for 15 min and then dried by hot air. Then, the ITO substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 15 min. After that, the substrates were transferred into a glove box (both H2O and O2 below 1 ppm). PTAA solution (2 mg ml−1 in toluene) was spin-coated on the ITO substrates at 4000 rpm and then dried on a hot plate at 100 °C for 10 min as the hole transport layer (HTL). To prepare high-quality perovskite films, we used an optimized two-step method, which is reported in our previous work.28 Firstly, the perovskite precursor containing PbI2 (1.2 M) and MAI (0.3 M) in DMSO and DMF (1:10) was spin-coated on the HTL substrates at 6000 rpm for 20 s. Secondly, 60 μL of MAI solution (40 mg mL−1 in IPA) was spin-coated on the top of the perovskite precursor on the substrates at 4000 rpm for 40 s. The films were annealed at 100 °C for 30 min to form MAPbI3 films. For the devices with 4-DA, after the prepared MAPbI3 films were cooled down to room-temperature, 4-DA solution (2 mg ml−1 in IPA) was spin-coated on the top of MAPbI3 films, and then dried at 70 °C for 10 min. After that, PC61BM was dissolved in CB (20 mg ml−1) and spin-coated on the prepared perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Then some of the substrates were thermally annealed at 90 °C for 30 min. Finally, BCP solution (0.5 mg ml−1 in IPA) was deposited by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s and then Ag cathodes (∼100 nm) were prepared via thermal evaporation (0.5 Å s−1) under a vacuum of 6 × 10−4 Pa.

(c) and (d) are the surface topography of the MAPbI3 film on the ITO/PTAA substrate without and with 4-DA, respectively. The pinhole positions are labeled by red arrows in (c). 
2.3 Characterization
The surface and interface morphology of the perovskite films was measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (FEI, Helios Nanolab 600i, USA). The contact angle of the surface of the films was tested using a surface contact angle tester (Zhongchen JC2000D1, China). The absorption and transmission spectra were measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-vis) (PerkinElmer, Lambda 365, USA). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra were measured using an XRD test instrument (Bruker, D8 Advance, Germany) with a Cu Kα radiation source under 40 kV and 44 mA. The steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra and time resolved PL (TRPL) spectra were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh, FS 5, China). The J–V curves of PSCs including the forward and reverse scans were measured using a source meter (Keithley, 2400, USA) under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 G at 100 mW cm−2 (Enlitech, SS-F5-3A, Taiwan). Light intensity was calibrated by using a standard silicon solar cell. Monochromatic incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was obtained by using an IPCE measurement system (Enlitech, QE-R, Taiwan). The PSCs without any encapsulation were kept to evaluate the stability of the devices, and the J–V curves of the devices under illumination were tested at specific intervals.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1b is the absorption spectrum of the PTAA film, and the inset is the contact angle result. The PTAA film shows high transmittance and only an absorption peak is observed in the UV range (around 380 nm), which will not decrease the light harvesting efficiency of the PSCs.29 It is worth noticing that the contact angle of the PTAA HTL used in this work is up to 89.24°, which shows hydrophobic characteristic, and it may facilitate the growth of the MAPbI3 crystals toward large grain sizes.30Fig. 1c is the surface topography of the MAPbI3 film on the ITO/PTAA substrate, and the low magnification SEM image in Fig. S2a† shows more grains of the MAPbI3 film. To obtain the average grain size, more than 70 individual grains are checked. The distribution of MAPbI3 grain sizes and the detailed information are shown in Fig. S2b and Table S1,† respectively. The largest grain size is over 6 μm, and the average grain size is about 2.63 μm, which is much larger than the grain sizes of perovskite films prepared by solvent annealing and other methods with a typical grain size of about ∼1 μm.31–34
However, there are many pinholes existing in the junction points of every three grains (Fig. 1c). These pinholes lead to decreased performance and stability of the devices. In order to solve this problem, we used 4-DA containing carboxyl groups and an aromatic benzene ring, which can passive the positive charge defects and Lewis-type defects, respectively.26 In addition, this material is hydrophobic, which may benefit the stability of PSCs according to previous work.27 4-DA is spin-coated on the surface of the MAPbI3 film, and then annealed at 70 °C for 10 min. The surface morphology of the MAPbI3 film is shown in Fig. 1d. It can be observed that the pinholes disappeared, leading to dense perovskite films, which confirms that 4-DA can effectively improve the compactness of the perovskite films.
In order to assess the impact of introduced 4-DA on the perovskite crystalline GBs, the cross-section data of the devices are investigated by SEM and the results are shown in Fig. 2. The GBs are clearly observed, and they are perpendicular to the substrates. It is observed that the fusions of the crystalline grains are not affected that much by 4-DA, which may be ascribed to the limited penetration of 4-DA into the GBs. Thermal annealing (TA) is used after PCBM coating to help the 4-DA diffuse into GBs, which is reported to be an effective method to improve the diffusion.24Fig. 2c and d are the cross-sectional SEM images of the devices with and without 4-DA treated by TA. It can be observed that the GBs almost disappeared as to PSCs with 4-DA treated by TA. So it can be confirmed that 4-DA diffused and filled into GBs as shown in Fig. 2d, which can benefit the charge transfer and improve the photovoltaic performance.35
 Fig. 2  (a) and (c) are the cross-sectional SEM images of the PSCs without and with TA, respectively. (b) and (d) are the cross-sectional SEM images of the PSCs modified by 4-DA without and with TA, respectively. The inset marked in red color in each figure shows the low-magnification cross-sectional SEM images. 
The perovskite films on ITO/PTAA exhibit two notable peaks located at 14.0° and 28.3°, which are indexed to the (110) and (220) planes of the MAPbI3 as shown in Fig. 3a.2 After PCBM coating, the XRD peak intensities of the two peaks decrease since PCBM blocks some X-ray signals. It can be seen that the intensities and peak positions of perovskite films are not affected by 4-DA introduction. The UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films with different coatings are shown in Fig. 3b, and the absorbance of MAPbI3/PCBM is very similar to that of MAPbI3/4-DA/PCBM. In order to get the bandgap of the different films, the data of (αhν)2vs. Eg derived from the absorption spectra are shown in the inset. The estimated optical band gap of the MAPbI3 after PCBM coating is 1.611 eV, which is higher than that of pristine MAPbI3 (1.609 eV). The bandgap is further increased to 1.614 eV as 4-DA is introduced. The bandgap is determined by the locations of the valence band and conduction band. It is reported that the passivation of the trap states can lead to an increased bandgap.24 Therefore, the increased bandgap can be attributed to the elimination of the trap states and defects in GBs and surfaces. Thus, the PCBM can passivate the trap states in perovskite films, and the trap states can be further passivated via 4-DA.

(b) The UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films with different coatings. The data of (αhν)2versus Eg derived from the absorption spectra are shown in the inset. 
To examine the impact of 4-DA on the performance of the PSCs, we first optimize the fabrication process of the PSCs by controlling the thickness of PTAA and the time of TA. A PCE of 16.67% (Jsc = 21.52 mA cm−2, FF = 71.69%, and Voc = 1.08) is obtained as the PTAA concentration is 2 mg ml−1 (Fig. S3 and Table S2†). This result is comparable with G. Xu's results.36 In addition, we also optimized TA time, and the comparison results of the devices with different modifications are shown in Fig. 4a and the parameters are listed in Table S3.† All kinds of the devices without TA show lower performance, and the average PCE is ∼17%. However, the highest PCE of the devices with 4-DA is over 18% which is higher than that of devices without 4-DA and TA. Therefore, these results confirm that 4-DA material leads to improved device performance. The device performance is enhanced significantly when the TA time is beyond 20 min. An average PCE of 18.29% and best PCE of 19.18% are achieved when the TA time is 30–40 min. Devices with different modifications including PCBM, 4-DA and TA are prepared and studied. Fig. 4b shows the J–V curves of the PSCs with different device configurations. The average photovoltaic performance parameters are listed in Table 1. The devices prepared with a configuration of ITO/PTAA/MAPbI3/PCBM without TA treatment exhibit poor PCE and repeatability. As 4-DA is introduced, the average PCE increases from 14.39% to 16.81%. The improved PCE is attributed to the perovskite film surface trap state passivation due to the 4-DA,27 which is consistent with the SEM and UV-vis absorption results. The PCE can be dramatically enhanced by TA of the devices with 4-DA, and the average PCE increases to 18.29%. This dramatic PCE improvement shows that the 4-DA can be filled into GBs by the TA treatment, and further passivate the trap states at GBs.

The devices are measured with different scan directions to study the hysteresis effect of our devices, and the hysteresis index (HI) values calculated from the J–V curves based on eqn (1)37 are shown in Table 1. (1)
The HI values are clearly reduced by 4-DA. After post-TA treatment application, the HI value of the devices with 4-DA is dramatically reduced to below 1% as TA is used to treat the devices. These results show that the 4-DA and TA treatment significantly reduce the hysteresis effect.
The photovoltaic parameters of 30 devices prepared under the same experimental conditions are used to study the photovoltaic performance affected by 4-DA and TA more accurately. The J–V curves of the PSCs based on PCBM with TA treatment (hereinafter referred to as the reference device) and PSCs based on 4-DA/PCBM with TA treatment (hereinafter referred to the 4-DA device) are shown in Fig. 5a. The average parameters are summarized in the inset. The statistical distribution histograms of the two kinds of devices are shown in Fig. 5b. For the 4-DA device, the average PCE value, Voc, FF and Jsc are 18.81%, 1.08 V, 77.48% and 22.46 mA cm−2, respectively. It exhibits improved device performance compared with that of the reference devices. The best PCE of 20.58% is achieved in the 4-DA device, which is comparable to the best performance of the devices with this device structure.19,38 The distribution histogram of PCE values of the 4-DA devices is much narrower compared to that of the reference devices, which indicates high repeatability of 4-DA devices. The IPCE spectra of the 4-DA and the reference devices are shown in Fig. 5c. The 4-DA device shows improved intensity in the range of 300–800 nm with a maximum value of 92%, which suggests that the trap density is reduced in the 4-DA device. The stable PCE and Jsc values of the 4-DA device measured at the maximum power point are ∼18.06% and 21.00 mA cm−2, respectively. The stable PCE and Jsc values of the reference device measured at the maximum power point are 17.26% and 20 mA cm−2, respectively. The improved stable PCE and Jsc of the 4-DA device can be ascribed to the defect passivation effect by 4-DA. Hysteresis is an obstacle to the estimation of actual PCE, and thus the J–V curves of reference and 4-DA devices are also measured in reverse and forward scan directions, as shown in Fig. 5e and f, respectively. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in insets. It can be observed that the hysteresis in the 4-DA device is negligible, which is smaller than that of the reference device. This can be attributed to the reduced migration of MA+ and I− along the crystal surface and GBs caused by 4-DA passivation.11,12

(c) The IPCE spectra and calculated Jsc of the 4-DA and reference devices. (d) The steady output characteristic of the 4-DA and reference devices. (e) and (f) are the J–V curves of the reference and 4-DA devices measured in forward and reverse directions, respectively. The inset table of (a) shows the average performance parameters of the two kinds of devices (30 devices were fabricated and tested for each kind of device). 
In order to investigate the improved device performance by 4-DA further, we study the J–V curves by eqn (2).2 (2)where Jsc is the short-circuit current density; J0 is the reverse saturated current density; KB is Boltzmann constant; T is the absolute temperature; Rs is the series resistance; Rsh is the shunt resistance; and A is the ideal factor. Usually, Rsh is larger than Rs, and J0 is very small. Therefore, eqn (2) can be simplified, and some physical parameters can be derived from the equation as follows.28 (3) (4)
The J–V curves of the two kinds of PSCs are replotted and fitted as shown in Fig. 6a and b. The Rs values are 4.52 Ω cm2 and 2.49 Ω cm2 for the reference and 4-DA devices, respectively. The smaller Rs of the 4-DA device is related to the improved FF. The J0 is also plotted in Fig. 6b. The J0 values of the reference and 4-DA devices are determined to be 7.85 × 10−8 mA cm−2 and 6.78 × 10−9 mA cm−2, respectively. When J = 0, the V in eqn (4) is equal to Voc, and eqn (4) can be changed to eqn (5). (5)

(f) The TRPL spectra of ITO/PTAA/MAPbI3 and ITO/PTAA/MAPbI3/4-DA, and the inset shows the steady PL spectra of the two kinds of films. 
According to eqn (5), the Voc increases with the increase of Jsc/J0. The increased Voc can be caused by the increased Jsc or the decreased J0. Jsc exhibits little variation. Therefore, the improved Voc of the 4-DA device can be explained by the smaller J0 compared to that of the reference device. J0 is directly proportional to the charge recombination rate.39 So, the enhanced Voc is also associated with the reduced recombination loss.
The J–V curves measured under different light intensities are shown in Fig. S5.† The light intensity-dependent Jsc of the reference and 4-DA devices shown in Fig. 6c provides more information about the charge recombination in the devices.40 The power law dependence of Jsc on light intensity (Jsc = Iα) is clear, and α can be obtained from the slope of the curves. When the α value equals to 1, all carriers are swept out prior to recombination.41 When the α value is less than 1, charge recombination loss may occur due to the bimolecular recombination,42 space charge effects43 and variations in the continuous distribution of the density of states.41 In our work, α (0.99) is close to 1 for the 4-DA device, which is higher than that of the reference device (0.95). This confirms that the carriers in the 4-DA device can be easily extracted, and the recombination loss is reduced. The above discussion supports the results related to J0 analysis.
The recombination loss may mainly result from the trap states at the surface and the GBs of the MAPbI3 films and interfaces of the devices.9 In order to obtain the density of defect states quantitatively, we measured the J–V response of the hole-only and electron-only devices, and the results are shown in Fig. 6d and e. It is clearly seen that the J–V curves exhibit ohmic behaviors (J ∝ V) and then show a rapid nonlinear increase, which indicates the transition into the trap filled limit (TFL) area.44 The onset voltage of the TFL area is labeled as VTFL which is directly associated with the density of the trap states nt as described in eqn (6).44 (6)where e is the elementary charge (≈1.60 × 10−19 C); L is the thickness of the perovskite film (320 nm); εr (= 32) is the relative dielectric constant of CH3NH3PbI3; ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (≈8. 85 × 10−10 F m−1); nt is trap state density. The hole trap density values are calculated to be 2.25 × 1018 cm−3 and 1.73 × 1018 cm−3 for the for the MAPbI3 and MAPbI3/4-DA, respectively. The electron trap density values are 5.53 × 1017 cm−3 and 4.15 × 1017 cm−3 for the MAPbI3 and MAPbI3/4-DA, respectively. Therefore, both of the hole and electron trap states are reduced by 4-DA and TA treatment. The reduction of trap states may be ascribed to the improved perovskite crystalline GBs and the passivation effect caused by carboxyl and benzene ring groups. The effects caused by 4-DA are also confirmed by the PL measurement (Fig. 6f). The fluorescence of ITO/PTAA/MAPbI3/4-DA exhibits more efficient quenching than that of the bare MAPbI3 film. The inset of Fig. 6f shows that the PL intensity of ITO/PTAA/MAPbI3/4-DA is weaker than that of the bare film. This indicates improved charge extraction and suppressed carrier recombination in ITO/PTAA/MAPbI3/4-DA-based perovskite films.35 Thus, 4-DA modification can reduce defects effectively in MAPbI3 films.
Trap states in GBs will promote ion migration and accelerate the interface and device degradation.7,11–13 The above statements show that the trap states are reduced via 4-DA and TA treatment. The gaps between the crystalline grains are also dramatically reduced (as shown in Fig. 2d). Thus, the stability of the PSCs should be improved. The PCE values as a function of storage time (in N2) of reference and 4-DA devices without any encapsulation are shown in Fig. 7. In Fig. 7a, the distribution of PCE becomes wider and wider with the storage time goes on. The PCE of the reference device can retain 87% of its initial value after 168 h of storage as shown in the insets of Fig. 7a. From Fig. 7b, the PCE of the 4-DA can retain 97% of its initial PCE, which shows a significant improvement of device stability. In addition, the distribution of the PCE values at different storage times is very narrow, which indicates that this method (4-DA and TA) can enhance the repeatability of the device fabrication.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated an effective passivation strategy by 4-DA and TA treatment in inverted PSCs. Large grain sizes are achieved by a non-wetting HTL prepared by a two-step method. High quality MAPbI3 films are successfully prepared by this passivation strategy, which dramatically enhanced the fusion of the crystalline grains in perovskite films. SEM, PL, stability, photovoltaic performance and semiconductor characteristics analysis results show that this passivation strategy can efficiently reduce trap states at the surface and GBs of the perovskite films, which dramatically enhanced the PCE and stability of the devices. A PCE of 20.58% is achieved in a simple inverted structure. The repeatability of the device fabrication has been significantly enhanced, and the modified device can retain 97% of its initial PCE after 168 h of storage. Therefore, this passivation strategy has great potential in low-temperature preparation of inverted PSCs with high efficiency and stability.
