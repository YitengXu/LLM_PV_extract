    , Accepted 10th February 2016First published on 15th February 2016AbstractA series of eight Ru(II) heteroleptic complexes incorporating an ancillary [2,2′]bipyridine functionalised at the [4,4′] positions with one (M-type) or two (B-type) thienylenevinylenes (nTVs, n = 2 or 4) is reported. Three types of substitutions have been used for nTVs: hexylthioether, hexyloxy and hexyl. The characterisation of the half-sandwich intermediates and final complexes is provided. In particular, the half-sandwich complexes in the M-type series are obtained as a racemate, whereas the heteroleptic complexes consist of two regioisomers. Finally, these complexes have been tested as dyes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Counterintuitively, better performances were obtained for M-type complexes with shorter 2TV moieties. The best performing dye was the Ru(II) complex mono-functionalized with a 2TV moiety having an hexylthioether substitution (M2S), which achieved a maximum power efficiency of 2.77% under full sun illumination (AM1.5G standard conditions). The structure–performance relationship in DSSCs is discussed based on photovoltaic and electrochemical data and DFT-calculations.
Introduction
Thienylenevinylenes (TVs) are a class of highly π-conjugated heteroaromatic molecules, characterized by low-oxidation potentials, moderate to strong absorption coefficients in the visible range, and high-mobility charge carriers owing to their rigid, linear, and highly conjugated backbones induced by the vinylic linkage between the thiophene moieties. Importantly, nTVs reach the saturation of their effective π-conjugation at a much longer chain length (n > 16 patterns)1,2 than other π-extended materials such as oligophenylenevinylene OPV (n = 8), oligothiophenes3,4 or oligothienenyleneethylenes (n ≈ 10–12). As a result, nTVs show a lower HOMO–LUMO gap (i.e. bathochromic shift of the maximum of absorption up to 600–700 nm) and lower oxidation potentials. These intrinsic electronic properties of oligo- (nTV, with n = 2–16) or poly-thienylenevinylene (PTV) materials attract great interest in a wide range of research areas, in organic electronics including organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),5 or in photovoltaic solar cells, including polymer solar cells (PSCs), bulk heterojunction (BHJ) or dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). nTVs have also been widely used as donors and/or molecular wires in donor–π-bridge–acceptor hybrid systems, in particular with fullerenes6,7 in which nTVs can efficiently play the role of donors (energy or electron donors) and/or molecular wires with an extremely low attenuation factor (β ≈ 0.01 Å−1 for n ≥ 4). In the BHJ field, however, PTV/PCBM blends usually give very poor efficiencies with PCE in the range of 0.2–0.9%, despite much higher carrier mobility and lower energy band gaps than other conjugated polymers. For instance, PCBM/poly(3-hexyl-2,5-thienylene)vinylene (P3HTV) blends have been reported with a maximum efficiency of 0.24%,8 while the poly-thiophene analogue, the well-known P3HT poly(3-hexyl-2,5-thiophene), blended with PCBM can show an efficiency of over 6%.9 Since the exact reasons for low efficiencies obtained for PTV materials in BHJ cells are not yet fully understood, recent theoretical studies10 and detailed photophysical studies by ultrafast spectroscopy techniques11 suggest a close relationship between the low efficiencies obtained for PTV/PCBM blends in BHJ cells and the non-emissivity of alkyl-substituted PTVs. One of the main drawbacks of alkyl-PTV materials is their non-luminescence (at n ≥ 4), which is explained by the extremely fast non-radiative decay of the alkyl-TV excited state.10,11 For instance, while the oligothiophene polymer P3HT is luminescent, the P3HTV analogue is not. However, it has been shown that fine-tuning of the electronic properties and morphology of TVs can be easily achieved by modulation of their molecular structure. Along these lines, a poly(3-carboxylated thienylene)vinylene (P3CTV)/PCBM blend was reported for BHJ cells with an efficiency of 2%. Moreover, P3CTV presents a relatively high quantum yield of emission. Other highly emissive PTV polymers or co-polymers with alkylsulfanyl chains have also been reported with a quantum yield of emission up to 68%. Recently, organogelators based on nTV oligomers were reported with high metallic conductivity (4.8 S cm−1 upon doping).12 Despite their potential as efficient organic materials, nTVs have received relatively limited attention and have been scarcely studied. In our previous studies, we have reported various dyes incorporating nTVs acting as donors13,14 and/or as bridges15 in D–π–A hybrid systems combining other donors such as triphenylamine, achieving power conversion efficiencies of over 6.25% in DSSCs.16,17 So far, polypyridyl Ru(II) complexes incorporating oligo nTVs (with n > 1)18,19 have not been considered. Moreover, only a few examples of these kinds of complexes are known and their applications are limited to organic electronics.20–22 Following the recent development and synthesis of new TV-based materials, we believe that there is an open field that yet has to be explored. In this work, eight RuII complexes having a bipyridine mono- (M-type) or bis-(B-type) functionalized with nTVs (n = 2 or 4), acting as an ancillary ligand, a 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid 2,2′-bipyridine (dcbpy) acceptor-anchoring group and two isothiocyanate monodentate ligands (donors) have been prepared and tested in DSSCs (Fig. 1).

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The (cis)tris-heteroleptic Ru(II) complexes were synthesized using microwave(MW)-assisted procedures under optimized conditions previously reported by us for the synthesis of the amphiphilic Ru(II)-complex with strong lipophilic character,23 starting from the nTV-functionalised bipyridines 1–8 (Scheme 1). MW heating has indeed proved to be a powerful method for the synthesis of such complexes as previously reported by others.24–27 The detailed synthesis, experimental procedures, and characterisation of the ligands and intermediates by UV/Vis, 1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopies and HRMS spectrometry are given in the ESI.† The first step involves the formation of a cationic, mononuclear, (p-cymene)Ru(II) half-sandwich chelate complex {[(η6-p-cymene)(k2-N,N-bipy)(k-Cl)]+} with a chloride counter anion28,29 as the first intermediate from Ru2Cl4(p-cymene)2 and the nTV-functionalized bipyridines 1–8. Subsequently, the (cis)tris-heteroleptic Ru(II) complexes were obtained in a two-step one-pot reaction from the half-sandwich complex Ru[L] (with L = 1–8; Scheme 1, step ii–iii). The coordination of the (2,2′-bipyridine)- 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (L′) to the metal center of Ru[L] primarily leads to the formation of the octahedral Ru(II) complex RuLL′Cl2, followed by the exchange of the chloride by isothiocyanate k1-bonded ligands to give RuLL′(NCS)2. All the target complexes could be obtained in good to excellent yields (60–95%) after purification, except B2O (37%) and M2S (49%) that were obtained in relatively low yields. Remarkably, when starting from a mono-substituted bipyridine ligand (1–4), the Ru(II) complexes were obtained in two regioisomeric forms [1,3] and [1,4] at a 1:1 ratio, whereas only one was obtained in the case of bis-substituted bipyridines (5–8). The two regioisomers were identified by 1H NMR spectroscopy (vide infra).

1H NMR characterization
As typical examples, the 1H NMR spectra of mono- (1 and 2) and the corresponding bis- 2TV-functionalized bipyridines (5 and 6, respectively) are depicted in Fig. 2. For the symmetrically (bis)-substituted bipyridines 5 and 6, a typical AX system (H-A/H-B) and a singlet signal (H-C) are observed for the pyridyl protons (sometimes an AMX pattern was observed instead). In contrast, these signals are split into two sets in the NMR spectra of the corresponding unsymmetrically (mono)-substituted bipyridines 1 and 2, showing two distinct AX systems (H-A/B and H-A′/B′) and two singlets (H-C and H-C′) for the protons of the two pyridyl moieties. All bipyridines display the characteristic patterns of nTV derivatives (with n = 2 or 4). In particular, the vinylene protons appear either as an AB quartet or AX-system with characteristic coupling constants of 15–16 Hz for the trans-coupled vinylene protons. The terminal aromatic proton of the thiophene moiety(ies) H-H appears at higher field as a characteristic singlet signal at around 6.75 ppm in the alkyl and thioether series, and it is significantly more shielded for the hexyloxy analogues (δ ≈ 6.0 ppm).

The 1H NMR spectra of the crude half-sandwich complex intermediates Ru[3] and Ru[7] are depicted in Fig. 3. As well as for the bipyridine ligands, the pyridyl protons appear as one AMX system for Ru[7] and split into two sets of signals (two AMX systems) for Ru[3]. Notably, the H-A and H-B protons appear to be strongly deshielded, whereas H-B is shielded, as a result of the coordination of bipyridine to the Ru metal centre. The features of the 2TV moiety are similar to those of the bipyridine parent ligands, showing in particular an AX system and an AB quartet for the trans-coupled vinylene protons H-D/E and H-F/G, respectively, with a coupling constant of 15–16 Hz. Interestingly, the mono-substituted (i.e. non-symmetrical) bipyridines 1–4 afford the corresponding half-sandwich complexes as a racemic mixture of two enantiomers (R or S). In particular, the NMR spectrum of Ru[3] displays an AA′BB′ system for the signals corresponding to the p-cymene aromatic protons (H-X, -X′, -Y and -Y′), whereas an AX system is observed for Ru[7] for the two sets of equivalent protons H-X and H-Y. The NMR spectra of the Ru(II) complexes display much more complex features (Fig. 4). First, all pyridyl protons become magnetically non-equivalent due to the octahedral geometry of these kinds of complexes. Thus twelve signals are in principle expected for the B-type compounds (four AB systems (A1–4/B1–4) and four singlets (C1–4)). In the case of M-type complexes, twice as much signals are expected because of the presence of two different regioisomers, for which 24 distinct signals (12 + 12) are thus expected only for the pyridyl protons. Between 9 and 10 ppm, four distinct doublet signals for the M- type complexes corresponding to the H-A1/A4 and H-A′1/A′4 protons of the regioisomers [1,3] and [1,4], respectively, can be clearly observed, whereas the B-type compounds show only two doublets (H-A1/A4). The numerous aromatic signals of the nTV moiety render the NMR spectra even more complex, although in any case, two sets of signals are expected for both the M-type (nTV and nTV′ due to the two different regiosiomers) and the B-type (the nTV arms at the 3- and 4-positions are non-equivalent to each other). This can be clearly observed in the NMR spectra of the hexyloxy-complexes M2O and B2O, which show the typical shielded singlet signals for this series of compounds at around 6.0 ppm. In both cases, two distinct singlets are observed, which correspond to the H-H and H-H′ protons of the [1,3] and [1,4] regioisomers of M2O, respectively, and to the H-H3 and H-H4 protons that belong to the two non-equivalent nTV arms at the 3- and 4-positions of B2O.

Spectral and electrochemical properties
The UV-Vis spectra of the Ru(II) complexes are presented in Fig. 5. M2 and B2, bearing respectively one and two 2TV moieties, display a characteristic broad absorption band in the visible region centered at around 450 nm with a molar extinction coefficient for B2 roughly twice that of M2. For these two complexes, the MLCT band of Ru(II) complexes can be distinguished as a shoulder at around 560–580 nm. For M4, with one 4TV moiety, a characteristic bathochromic shift is observed for the main absorption band that appears to be centered at around 540–550 nm due to the extended π-conjugation of the TV oligomer from two-to-four patterns. Following another characteristic trend of nTV derivatives, the maximum epsilon value for M4 (one 4TV) is roughly twice that of M2 (one 2TV) and similar to that of B2 (two 2TV). B4 with two 4TV units displays a broad and intense absorption covering the whole 400–700 nm visible region with a high molar extinction coefficient reaching an impressive maximum value of 120000 M−1 cm−2, which is also roughly twice that of M4.

The UV-Vis spectra of the hexylthio- and hexyloxy-substituted 2TV-complexes display similar optical features to their corresponding hexyl-substituted analogues, but with slightly more redshifted absorption bands, and accompanied by significantly higher epsilon values for the hexyloxy complexes. Finally, all these complexes were non-luminescent in solution (neither fluorescence nor phosphorescence). Next, we investigated the electrochemical properties of the complexes using a 0.1 M solution of NBu4PF6 in THF as the supporting electrolyte. The potentials were measured vs. Fc+/Fc and then converted to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) by addition of +0.63 V. The electrochemical data and the corresponding energy levels for the HOMO and LUMO are summarized in Table 1. Except for 4TV derivatives M4 and B4, the first anodic wave for 2TV-based dyes is reversible (or pseudo-reversible) according to cyclic voltammetry (CV), which is assigned to the oxidation of the ruthenium metal centre. The second one that occurs at higher potential is irreversible and assigned to the oxidation of nTVs (moieties), as known for these kinds of derivatives. ((E)-1,2-Bis[2-(3,4-dihexylthienyl)]ethylene was reported in the literature with a first oxidation potential EOX1 of +1.20 V vs. NHE).1,2 In the cases of M4 and B4, the first oxidation wave is broad and irreversible. As known for 4TV derivatives, the first oxidation occurs at a much lower potential than 2TV and it is also irreversible (hexyl-substituted 4TV ((E,E,E)-1,2-bis[5-(3′,4′-dihexyl-2′-thienylvinyl)(3,4-dihexyl-2-thienyl)]ethylene) was previously reported in the literature with a first oxidation potential EOX1 at +0.83 V vs. NHE).1,2 Thus, it should be reasonable to assign the broad wave at the anodic side to the overlap of the first oxidation of the Ru metal centre and that of the 4TV moiety(ies) (irreversible). On the cathodic side, reduction waves were assigned to the characteristic one-electron reduction of ruthenium(II)-diimine complexes localized on the bipyridine ligand30 (irreversible according to CV). The schematic potential-energy level diagram was constructed from the HOMO–LUMO energy levels deduced from the electrochemical data obtained by Osteryoung square-wave voltammetry (OSWV), with EHOMO = EOX and ELUMO = ERedvs. NHE (Fig. 6). The data for N719 previously reported in the literature,31 as well as the value of the TiO2 CB (≈−0.5 V) and that of the I3−/I− redox couple (+0.35 V) are also presented for comparison. In comparison with N719, the HOMO levels are less stabilized by the presence of the nTV moieties, which might make the dye-regeneration by the redox couple less efficient.

 Fig. 6  Schematic energy levels based on electrochemical data (data for N719 are derived from ref. 31). 
As the LUMO level of all dyes is located beyond the TiO2-CB and even higher than that reported for N719, it should, in principle, make the electron-injection thermodynamically feasible in all cases.
Photovoltaic performances of DSSCs
Dye-loading and photovoltaic data of the alkyl-substituted complexes are summarized in Table 2. As expected, the total amount of dyes adsorbed on the surface decreases with the number and length of nTV moieties, from 10.7 × 10−8 mol for M2 (one 2TV) to 7–8 × 10−8 mol for B2 and M4 (two 2TV and one 4TV respectively) and then drastically drops to 3 × 10−8 for M4 (two 4TV). This factor hence primarily contributes to the difference observed in the JSC because the absolute amount of injected electrons depends on the total number of dyes adsorbed on the surface. However, this cannot explain solely the huge difference observed in the JSC between these dyes. For instance, the JSC is considerably higher for M2 and B2 (5.57 mA cm−2 and 3.37 mA cm−2, respectively) despite comparable dye-loadings (although slightly less for the latter). The use of co-adsorbent CHENO resulted in lower performances, thus indicating that aggregation is not an issue for these kinds of dyes. The corresponding 4TV analogues M4 and B4 achieved strikingly lower PCE mainly caused by the drop in the JSC. Also, the M-type analogue M4 performed better than the B-type analogue B4. In addition to reduced dye-loading caused by longer 4TV subunits, it is known that 4TV excited states decay through ultrafast non-radiative processes.11,12 It should be the main pathway of deexcitation for these dyes rather than electron-injection, thus explaining the low photovoltaic performances of these dyes.

Next, we studied the thioether- and hexyloxyl-substituted 2TV-analogues. The dye-loading densities were found to be in the same range as the 2TV-alkyl-substituted analogues, with a total amount of adsorbed dyes of ca. 10–11 × 10−8 mol for the M-type and 8–9 × 10−8 mol for the B-type. For this series of compounds, three different electrolytes that differ only in the content of LiI were used (A: 0.05 M, B: 0.1 M and C: 0.2 M of LiI). The effect of higher content of lithium is to cause a downshift of the TiO2-CB, producing a larger driving force for electron-injection.
For all dyes of this series, the JSC and PCE increased only slightly from electrolyte A to B, and then decreased for higher content of LiI in electrolyte C (Table 3). Thus, this indicates that the electron efficiency is optimal at this concentration of LiI. As the electrolyte composition is similar to those used for many high performing dyes to achieve optimal performances, the LUMO of these complexes must be ideally located with respect to the TiO2-CB level providing a sufficient driving force for electron-injection, in agreement with our electrochemical data. Therefore, it seems that this factor should not constitute the reason for the low efficiencies achieved by these dyes, in comparison with other high-performing RuII dyes such as N719. Following the same trend as the alkyl-substituted TV analogues, B2S gave a much lower JSC and efficiency than the M-type analogue M2S. The only exception was B2O, which showed comparable (slightly better) performances to M2O. As the VOC is usually higher (or at least comparable) for the M-type with respect to the B-type, a possible difference in the recombination rate at the electrolyte/TiO2 interface will not be able to explain the trend in the JSC neither. On the other hand, the difference in driving forces for dye-regeneration could explain the difference in the JSC. Under the same conditions using electrolyte A, the JSC and efficiency grow in the order M2S > M2 > M2O in the M-type series, whereas a reverse trend was observed in the B-type B2O ≈ B2 ≫ B2S.

To get insights into the geometrical and electronic properties of the dyes, we performed quantum-chemical calculations by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level in a vacuum (Spartan 14 package). As shown in Fig. 7, the HOMO of all complexes is a combination of Ru t2g and NCS π-orbitals, as found in similar compounds,18 without contribution from the TV moieties. This is in agreement with our electrochemical data, which reveal that the first oxidation takes place at the Ru centre and the oxidation of the TV moiety takes place at higher potentials. The LUMO is a π*-orbital localized on the dcbpy acceptor-anchoring ligand, and partially mixed with those of the TV moieties, more pronounced in the cases of thioether- and alkoxy- than alkyl-substituted derivatives, and for 4TV than 2TV. Since these heteroleptic complexes are adsorbed onto TiO2 through dcbpy, such configuration is crucial to achieve efficient electron injection of the excited dye into TiO2. The trend is similar in the LUMO+1, but with a larger contribution coming from the TV moieties and a weaker contribution coming from the dcbpy unit. The only exception is B2S, for which this configuration is reversed for the LUMO and LUMO+1 levels. The poor electronic density over the dcbpy unit in the LUMO for this dye should explain well why it achieved the poorest efficiency in the 2TV series. For the M-type derivatives, the regioisomers [1,3] have a very similar configuration to their corresponding B-type derivatives, whereas [1,4] tends to have significantly much weaker contributions of the TV moieties in the LUMO and dcbpy in the LUMO+1. In view of these results, it is proposed that one of the two regioisomers should perform better than the other one, which should explain, in addition to higher dye-loading, why the M-type derivatives always tend to show superior efficiency compared to the B-type despite their lower extinction coefficients. This behaviour is consistent with previous studies reported by El-Shafei and co-workers who reported that the superior efficiency of mono versus bis-electron-donor ancillary ligands in heteroleptic Ru(II) bipyridyl complexes was due to better electron injection of the former in addition to higher dye-loading.32,33

Conclusions
Eight Ru(II) bipyridyl complexes incorporating an ancillary [2,2′]bipyridine functionalised at the [4,4′] positions with one (M-type) or two (B-type) thienylenevinylenes (nTVs, n = 2 or 4) were studied in DSSCs. Three different types of substitutions were used for TVs: hexylthioether, hexyloxy and hexyl. B-type complexes tend to show lower efficiencies with respect to their M-type analogues. In addition to the difference in dye loading, it is believed that one of the two regioisomers of the M-type analogue performs better than the other one, thus contributing to the overall higher efficiency. Regarding the length of the TV, lower JSC and hence efficiencies were obtained with longer 4TV rather than shorter 2TV moieties despite considerably improved light-harvesting properties and donor ability. We explain the low photovoltaic performances achieved by these dyes by competitive fast non-radiative decay of 4TV excited states, which should be the main pathway of deexcitation, rather than electron-injection of the dye in TiO2. Regarding the type of substitution of the 2TV derivatives, hexylthioether gave the best results in the M-type series and the worst results in the B-type series. Following these trends, a maximum power conversion efficiency of 2.77% under full sun illumination (AM1.5G) was achieved by M2S bearing one hexylthioether-substituted 2TV moiety.
