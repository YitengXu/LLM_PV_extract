Processes that can be integrated into a continuous manufacturing platform, such as roll-to-roll, where several processes can be carried out sequentially are necessary to develop a new cost-competitive solar technology. In this work, intense pulsed light thermal post-processing is coupled with scalable slot-die coating and air knife evaporation in a high-speed roll-to-roll process of up to 2 m min−1. The optimization of IPL energy parameters, web speeds, solution flow rates, and concentration of precursor inks yielded a champion power conversion efficiency of 11.24% for a 1 cm2 roll-to-roll coated device. The overall processing time for a single layer in this process is reduced from minutes to seconds and the overall footprint of the manufacturing process is decreased. This demonstrates the promising capabilities for intensed pulsed light to reduce manufacturing costs and paves a roadmap for scalable and efficient PSCs on a roll-to-roll platform.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have captured tremendous interest in the photovoltaic community due to their excellent optoelectronic properties including tunable band gap, high light absorption, long carrier diffusion lengths, high charge carrier mobility, and low nonradiative recombination losses. Moreover, these PSCs offer advantages of cost-effectiveness, ease of fabrication and remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).1–6 The fabrication of large area depositions has been demonstrated using several techniques such as inkjet printing,7,8 gravure printing,9,10 spray deposition,11,12 doctor-blade coating,13,14 slot-die coating,15,16 and vapor deposition,17,18 which have been adopted for roll-to-roll19,20 and sheet-to-sheet21 platforms. Among them, slot-die coating is a suitable deposition technique for high volume production using high speed roll-to-roll industrial manufacturing on wide webs and has been demonstrated for perovskite films and charge transporting layers in a cost-effective mass production over rigid and flexible substrates under ambient conditions.22,23 The advantages of the slot die capabilities include very high-speed operation and uniform coating thickness across the web. Galagan et al. demonstrated a slot die deposited SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) on an indium tin oxide coated polyethylene terephthalate substrate (PET/ITO), followed by a triple cation perovskite device with a PCE of 13.5% on an active area of 0.09 cm2 using a fast-drying technique and optimized solvents.24
The speed of roll-to-roll deposition of solution phase chemistries for PSCs relies on the evaporation of solvents and film transformations that are often carried out in ovens. Methods that can decrease the dwell times for these operations can further improve the economics of PSCs.25 Radiative thermal processes, such as NIR-flash annealing, rapid thermal annealing, and intense pulsed light (IPL), exhibit promising abilities to reduce dwell times.26–28 In particular, IPL can reduce the dwell times from minutes to less than one second and can be implemented in-line with other roll-to-roll processes. IPL produces high intensity light pulses over a broad spectrum ranging from ultraviolet to near infrared from a xenon lamp inducing high temperatures in large area films lasting just a fraction of a millisecond. Due to the rapidity of the process, IPL can be implemented on a roll-to-roll platform using a very small footprint for high speed operation. IPL has been used for sintering metallic (copper and silver) coatings on PET substrates and for thin-film enabled transistors and batteries.29–33 More recently, IPL has been established for the processing of perovskite and other charge transport layers for the fabrication of efficient PSCs by eliminating conventional thermal processing. Lavery et al.34 annealed a two-step deposited perovskite film in 2 ms using the IPL technique, and A. H. Ghahremani et al.35 used an IPL gradient flash annealing obtaining a superior morphology and high crystallinity of spin coated perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) films. S. Das et al.36 have used the IPL technique for achieving a high conductive TiO2 layer over flexible PET substrates and R. T. Piper et al.37 used IPL for obtaining direct conversion of NiOx from sol–gel precursors for hole transport layers and to crystallize photoactive methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) layers on flexible willow glass substrates.
In this work, IPL thermal post-processing is demonstrated in line with a slot-die coating and a rapid evaporation via an air knife process for a continuous high-speed roll-to-roll operation as shown in Fig. 1. A polymer web (PET/ITO) is continuously subjected to each of the processes between unwind and rewind stations at a constant speed. The web is a continuous flexible substrate that is conveyed between unwind and rewind stations at a constant speed, where functional films are created in successive processes. An air knife is utilized to evaporate the solvents, and IPL is used as a means to thermally process the layers. Two layers are demonstrated in this continuous operation: SnO2 as an electron transport layer (ETL) on PET/ITO, followed by a perovskite (MAPbI3) as an active absorbing layer. The optimization of the IPL process, solution flow rates, and concentration of precursor inks for web speeds up to 2 m min−1 was carried out to attain uniformity over a large area for a high quality of SnO2 and perovskite films. All the processes for this study were performed in an ambient environment having humidity ≥40%. An inline corona discharge treater (CDT) is used to clean and increase the surface energy of the web. The thin films were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ultraviolet and visible spectroscopy (UV-vis) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), where the latter two were also used to study the uniformity across and down the web. Devices measuring 1 cm2 were built and characterized using I–V, resulting in a champion device power conversion efficiency of 11.24%.

2. Experimental section
Roll to roll coating: roll-to-roll depositions and IPL of electron transport and active perovskite layers were carried out using a custom designed roll-to-roll machine built and maintained by the Conn Center for Renewable Energy Research at the University of Louisville. The speed and tension of the web are maintained by two Mitsubishi motors controlled by a PLC. An ITO coated PET substrate (50 Ohm sq.−1) having a 15 cm web width is used on the roll-to-roll coater, which is equipped with a CDT (EnerCon CoronaFlex) for surface treatment, a slot-die (Premier Dies), an air-knife pass drying unit (ExAir), and an intense pulse light (IPL) (Xenon Corp. S2210) as shown in Fig. 1. All of the processes are done at a constant web speed.
2.1 Processing of SnO2 as an electron transport layer
The SnO2 films were deposited over CDT treated ITO coated PET substrates under ambient conditions using slot-die. A CDT is often used with roll-to-roll depositions to increase the surface energy of a web surface such that it exceeds the surface tension of the chemistry which improves wetting. The SnO2 precursor ink was prepared by diluting a SnO2 colloidal dispersion (Alfa Aesar, 15 wt%) with DI water and anhydrous ethanol in a vol. ratio of 2:1 containing 12 μl of Triton-X 100 surfactant. Prior to the deposition, the solution was stirred for 2 h, sonicated for 20 min, and filtered through a 20 μm cellulose syringe filter. The as-obtained SnO2 solution was deposited by slot-die coating with a 25 μm thick shim at a web speed of 2 m min−1, meniscus gap of 50 μm, and flow rate of 1.8 ml min−1, followed by an air-knife drying (∼30 psi) and IPL process having an energy density of 1.22 J cm−2 (1940 V), duration of 1000 μs and delay time of 200 ms.
2.2 Processing of the perovskite layer
The perovskite precursor solution consists of an equimolar ratio (0.6 M) of methyl ammonium iodide (MAI) and lead iodide (PbI2) dissolved in a mixed solvent of a 3:2 vol. ratio of acetonitrile (ACN) and 2-methoxy ethanol (2-ME) and subjected to stirring for 2 h in a glove box. 20 mol% of L-α-phosphatidylcholine (LP) surfactant and DMSO were added to the solution prior to deposition. The deposition was carried out using a slot-die coater having a 25 μm thick shim at a web speed of 1.8 m min−1, meniscus gap of 50 mm, and flow rate of 1.6 ml min−1, followed by an air-knife drying (∼20 psi) and IPL process at 1500 V, a duration of 600 μs and a delay time of 1000 ms. The temperature and relative humidity are in the average range of 25 to 30 °C, and ≥40%, respectively.
2.3 Device fabrication
The roll-to-roll coated SnO2 and perovskite films were taken off the web and sliced into suitable small pieces for the device fabrication having an active area of 1 cm2. The device fabrication is completed after spinning a spiro-OMeTAD solution as a hole transporting layer (HTL) and thermal evaporation of molybdenum oxide (MoOx) as a buffer layer and final top Ag contacts. The HTL was deposited by spinning spiro-OMeTAD solution over roll-to-roll deposited perovskite films at a speed of 2000 rpm for 40 s. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 144 mg of p,o-spiro-OMeTAD (Lumtec) in 2 ml of chlorobenzene, and 58 μl of 4-tert-butylpyridine, 35 μl of a 520 mg ml−1 Li-TFSI solution in acetonitrile and 58 μl of a 500 mg ml-1 FK209 cobalt salt in acetonitrile were also added. Subsequently, the substrates were transferred to a thermal evaporator under a pressure of 2.0 × 10−6 mbar, where 8 nm of MoOx as a buffer layer and an 80 nm Ag back electrode were deposited on top of the spiro-OMeTAD film. The Ag electrodes were evaporated with shadow custom designed masks for determining the active area of the device, which is 1 cm2.
2.4 Characterization
The roll-to-roll coated SnO2 and perovskite film thicknesses were measured using a Veeco Dektak 3 M stylus surface profilometer. UV-visible absorption was carried out using an Agilent Carry UV-spectrometer. XRD measurements were carried out using a D8 Rigaku instrument equipped with Cu Kα radiation of 1.54 Å. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were captured using a Thermo Scientific. The J–V curves of PSCs were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter at room temperature. The light source was a solar simulator (Oriel class AAB) and was equipped with a 1000 W tungsten lamp to match AM 1.5 G. The intensity of the light (100 mW cm−2) was calibrated with a standard silicon reference solar cell (SolarMade standards, NREL certified). The devices have an active area of 1 cm2 and scanned under both light and dark conditions in the range of 0 to 1.2 V at a scan speed of 100 mV s−1.
3. Results and discussion
In roll-to-roll scalable production, a key factor for achieving highly efficient PSCs is creating uniform, large area charge transport layers and the photoactive perovskite layer on a continuously moving high speed web. The roll-to-roll processing of the films in this work consists of three steps: (a) slot-die coating of precursor solution, (b) solvent evaporation from the wet film using an air-knife, and (c) thermal processing using IPL. Each step is time-sensitive and must be optimized to the continuous web, where the slowest process defines the overall web speed. The optimization of the inks, deposition and drying is summarized here, with most of the details provided in the ESI,† since the focus of the work is integrating IPL into a continuous roll-to-roll production. The control of the evaporation includes changes to the solvent systems (higher vapor pressure solvents) and the use of forced convection (air knives). Faster evaporating solvents will allow for a faster web speed. Solvents such as water and dimethylformamide (DMF) have low vapor pressures and can thus prolong the evaporation process, which can slow web speeds or increase the overall footprint of the process. The SnO2 inks employed alcohols and the perovskite inks adopted a co-solvent system of a 3:2 vol. ratio of ACN:2-MeOH for achieving both fast drying and large perovskite crystal grains at room temperature.16,38,39 Both inks also utilized surfactants to improve the wetting during deposition. The slot die deposition requires that the flow rate of the inks, web speed and gap between the tool and the web are balanced in order to maintain a consistent meniscus to achieve a uniform coating. These refinements ensure that a uniform dry film is translated into the IPL for thermal processing. In this study, all the films and corresponding devices are fabricated in a continuous process by using solution processing of slot-die coating deposition over 15 cm wide ITO coated PET films under ambient conditions, with evaporation occurring using a 15 cm wide air knife, and thermally processed using an IPL unit with a 15 cm × 15 cm processing area.
3.1 Optimizing different IPL conditions
The spectrum of the xenon lamp is from 300 to 1100 nm and the intensity of the energy is manipulated by the voltage applied across the lamp and the length of the pulse.40 The optimization of the IPL parameters includes the energy density (J cm−2), pulse width (μs) and pulse delay (ms). The energy density and the pulse width are tuned to deliver sufficient energy without damaging the films or the underlying substrate. The control of the pulse delay is to time the pulses such that the thin films will be exposed to multiple pulses as the web passes through the IPL unit, where the frequency of the flashes is the inverse of the delay time. The IPL unit has an optical window of 15 cm by 15 cm, and it is advantageous to flash the lamps such that each section of the moving web is exposed to multiple flashes to ensure uniform heating. Thus, the number of flashes the films are exposed to is equal to the length of the window (15 cm) divided by the web speed multiplied by the frequency of the lamp. The spectrum of the lamp output and the description of the pulse train are shown in Fig. S10.†
The deposition and thermal processing of SnO2 in roll-to-roll manufacturing has been carried out where the thermal processing is accomplished in an oven, which improves the performance of the devices.41,42 The IPL can be used to replace the oven, where the optimization of the IPL process involves multiple pulses as the web translates under the light source. The use of IPL with a SnO2 thin film for perovskites has previously been shown to maximize the binding energy of Sn 3d5/2, which leads to an improved charge transfer.43 That work utilized glass as the substrate, which has a higher thermal mass which will require higher energy densities. In this work, the IPL processing of the SnO2 layer was optimized considering energy densities of 0.85, 1.22 and 2.13 J cm−2. The delay time of 200 ms was chosen such that at 2 m min−1 the film would be exposed to as many pulses as possible (>20) to ensure that the films are completely processed. The SEM images of the surface of the SnO2 films after the IPL processing are shown in Fig. 2. It is clear from these images that at an energy density of 2.1 J cm−2, the films have cracked indicating that the energy was too high. It was also observed that the films at 0.85 J cm−2 exhibited scratches from the rewind process indicating that the energy was too low. Thus, the optimal response was determined to be 1.22 J cm−2 as this condition bridged the processing window.
 Fig. 2  SEM images of roll-to-roll slot-die coated SnO2 films processed at three different IPL energy densities (a) 0.85, (b) 1.22, and (c) 2.13 J cm−2, respectively. 
Similarly, the deposition and thermal processing of a perovskite thin film has been carried out using an oven to accomplish the thermal annealing.22,24,44 The IPL process can replace the oven and since the perovskite film absorbs light energy very well it requires an overall lower energy than that of SnO2. Thus, the number of pulses and energy density of each pulse can be reduced. During optimization, different IPL annealing conditions were investigated as listed out in Table 1 by varying different energies and the duration of pulses to achieve quality perovskite films. For each set of conditions, the corresponding labeling is given as IPL# A, B, C, D, E, and F respectively. The pulse delay time of 1000 ms was kept constant and chosen such that the perovskite film was exposed to 5 pulses of energy to ensure even annealing over the moving web.

From Fig. 3 it is seen that there is complete degradation of the perovskite film for the conditions of IPL# A. This is attributed to the generation of high heat flux at stronger pulses with a high energy value of 1.57 J cm−2 and the corresponding morphology is shown as a needle-like structure of dissociated perovskite precursor composition. As the energy values are decreased further from IPL# B to IPL# F, a gradual transition from cracked, pale, yellow-colored films to a uniform dark film with the formation of crystalline perovskite films having minimal pinholes was found. Thus, the case of IPL# E conditions remains as the optimal annealing conditions for obtaining quality perovskite films with an improved crystallinity and high surface coverage. The lower energy density value of IPL# F resulted in a film quality that was poor exhibiting agglomeration of small crystals along with large voids.

Thus, under the optimized conditions of IPL and web speed, a suitable slot-die coating of uniform perovskite and SnO2 films is achieved with an average thickness of 940 nm and 72 nm, and their surface roughness are found to be 25 nm and 8 nm, respectively. The perovskite coating thickness is more than the optimal 500 nm, which is due primarily to high level coating non-uniformities as the layer was reduced due to the roughness of the ITO. More work is required to reduce this layer thickness, primarily towards smoothing the interface between the ITO and perovskite. The optical images of the as-deposited perovskite films are shown in Fig. 4a and b and SEM images are shown in Fig. 4c and d. The slot-die coated perovskite films exhibit a compact and uniform layer with an average crystal size of ∼450 nm (a video demonstrating the roll-to-roll deposition of the perovskite film is presented in the ESI†). The process parameters for both the SnO2 and perovskite films are shown in Table 2. The IPL accomplishes the thermal processing of SnO2 and perovskite films in a fraction of seconds in line on a continuous high web speed and has a very small footprint.

3.2 Uniformity
Samples were collected at locations across the web (orthogonal to web movement spanning a 15 cm width) and down the web (parallel to web movement over a 2 m length) of IPL processed perovskite films as shown in Fig. 5a. The thickness measurements of the perovskite film yielded an average 940 ± 21 nm. UV-visible absorption and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were also done on these samples and their corresponding spectra are shown in Fig. 5b and c. The absorption profiles in Fig. 5b show a very similar distribution further verifying the uniform thickness as well as demonstrating a uniform annealing. The XRD spectra exhibited the same peak at 14.2° corresponding to the (110) crystal plane of the tetragonal phase of the perovskite structure from all the samples, and no other additional peaks were detected. These data demonstrate that the thickness of the perovskite and crystalline structure of the slot die, IPL processed films from the continuous web were uniform.

3.3 Photovoltaic performance
Solar cell devices were assembled from the optimized roll-to-roll slot die coated and IPL processed SnO2 and perovskite films chosen from five locations across and down the web as shown in Fig. 5a. The champion device exhibited a PCE of 11.24% with a Voc of 0.91 V, Jsc of 23.7 mA cm−2, and FF of 52% over an active area of 1 cm2 as shown in Fig. 6a. A statistical distribution of the performance from ten 1 cm2 devices (active area 1 cm2) collected from each of the five locations is shown in Fig. 6b. An average stabilized PCE of 10.6% was obtained with an average open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.97 V, current density (Jsc) of 22.9 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 47%. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. The FF and the Voc are lower than expected and can be attributed to the thickness of the perovskite and ITO layers. A thicker perovskite layer will reduce the FF and Voc due to a higher charge recombination. The thickness of the ITO layer on the PET yields a resistance of 50 Ω sq.−1 and hence will decrease the FF as is evident from the slope of the J–V curve showing high series resistance.

4. Conclusion
A large area deposition of SnO2 and perovskite films using a slot die coating and IPL process inline on a continuously moving web was demonstrated. The optimization of the processing included varying web speeds, different solvent systems for perovskite inks and different IPL conditions and each of them play a significant role in attaining high quality films over large areas at high web speeds. The films were optimized for uniform thickness and crystallinity across a 15 cm wide web and down a 2 m section of the web as demonstrated by thickness measurements, UV-vis spectroscopy and XRD. The resulting PSCs exhibited a champion PCE of 11.24% with an average stabilized PCE of 10.57% for an active area of 1 cm2 obtained from random locations across a 15 cm web and 2 m long roll. This work presents a scalable method for low-cost and efficient PSCs by employing an IPL over roll-to-roll platform.
