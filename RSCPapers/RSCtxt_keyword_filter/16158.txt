Because of their unique advantages, TMDC p–n diodes have been studied for next-generation electronics and optoelectronics. However, their efficiency must be increased for commercialization. In this study, we demonstrated a heterostructure composed of few-layer ReS2 and WSe2. This few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure exhibits a p–n junction and an n–n junction in different gate-bias regimes. In the p–n junction regime, the heterostructure shows outstanding rectification behavior. Additionally, we identify three carrier-transfer mechanisms − direct tunneling, Fowler–Nordheim tunneling, and the space charge region − depending on the drain bias. Furthermore, the photovoltaic effect is observed in this few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure. As a result, a high fill factor (≈ 0.56), power conversion (≈ 1.5%), and external quantum efficiency (≈ 15.3%) were obtained. This study provides new guidelines for flexible optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
The conventional diode structure is extensively employed by Si, group III–V and other semiconductors.1–4 The diode structure is used for various devices such as rectifiers, photovoltaic devices, and light-emitting diodes.1–4 Bulk Si and III–V semiconductors have high-quality electronics and optoelectronics but are not flexible or transparent.1–4 Therefore, it is difficult to apply them to next-generation devices such as flexible displays and transparent solar cells. Unlike ordinary semiconductors, two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have excellent electrical and optical properties, besides being flexible and transparent.5–8 Thus, TMDCs are emerging semiconductors in future electronics and optoelectronics.
In photovoltaic devices, the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite material, which has been studied extensively in recent years, has a high efficiency, flexibility, and transparency.9–11 However, the organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite material is not eco-friendly and degrades rapidly because it is composed of Pb and organic materials.12–14 In contrast, TMDCs are flexible and transparent, as well as inorganic materials. Therefore, photovoltaic devices with TMDCs are expected to be more eco-friendly and longer-lasting than organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells. Despite their unique advantages, most TMDC heterostructures exhibit a low fill factor (FF, 0.22–0.5) and low power-conversion efficiency (PCE, 0.005–0.9%) in photovoltaic devices.15–19 Owing to their low efficiency, numerous studies have been conducted to improve their efficiency (1–9%) by using a heterostructure comprising TMDCs and bulk materials.20–22 In these cases, however, the process sequence is complicated, and it is difficult to make the device flexible and transparent. Consequently, it is essential to achieve a high-efficiency device comprising a TMDC heterostructure.
Recently, it was reported that a ReS2 field-effect transistor has very high photoresponsivity (Rph = 88600 A W−1) and external quantum efficiency (EQE = 3168%).23–25 Also, it has a direct bandgap in not only monolayer form but also bulk form, unlike other TMDCs.24,25 According to these results, ReS2 exhibits potential for electronics and optoelectronics.
In this study, we examined the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure. Regarding the electrical properties, the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure shows different characteristics, such as a p–n junction and an n–n junction depending on the gate-bias regime. We explained three carrier-transfer mechanisms in the p–n junction, depending on the drain bias. Additionally, we observed the optoelectrical properties of the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure under a negative gate bias (Vgs = −50 V). A high FF (≈ 0.56), PCE (≈ 1.5%) and EQE (≈ 15.3%) were obtained.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows a schematic diagram of the ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure. In the experiment, we used exfoliated ReS2 and WSe2 flakes. The ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure comprises a ReS2 bottom layer and a WSe2 top layer. As shown in the side view and the top view, the ReS2 has a 1T′ structure, and the WSe2 has a 2H structure.24–29 The band gap of ReS2 and WSe2 is around 1.5 eV and 1.2 eV, respectively.24–26,28,29 Electrodes were made on each layer side. On the ReS2 side, Cr/Au was used for the n-type electrode, as Cr has a work function of ≈4.5 eV.29 We used Au electrodes on the WSe2 side. The Au work function is ≈5.1 eV (see Methods).29

To measure the topography and thickness of ReS2 and WSe2, we performed optical microscopy (OM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. Fig. 1(b) shows an OM image and an AFM image of the ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure. In the OM image, the yellow dotted area and red dotted area correspond to the ReS2 and WSe2 flakes, respectively. Through the OM image, we confirmed that the ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure is well fabricated. Additionally, we measured the thickness of the blue dotted area in the OM image via AFM. The thicknesses of ReS2 and WSe2 were ≈7 and ≈5 nm, respectively. As a result, we confirmed the clean and smooth surface of the entire area shown in Fig. 1(b).

Fig. 1(c) shows the Raman spectrum of few-layer ReS2. On the ReS2 side, Raman scattering peaks were observed at 150, 200, and 308 cm−1, corresponding to E2g, Ag-like, and Eg-like modes, respectively.24,26 ReS2 has the characteristic that there is no shift of the Raman scattering peaks with thickness dependence.24 The Raman spectrum of few-layer WSe2 shows E2g at 248 cm−1, 2LA(M) at 256 cm−1, and B2g at 307 cm−1 in Fig. 1(d).27,30 Interestingly, the B2g mode of the WSe2 Raman scattering is observed in the bilayer or few-layer structures, but not in the monolayer.27 Additionally, we observed the Raman scattering of the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure region (Fig. 1(e)). None of the Raman scattering peaks for few-layer ReS2 and WSe2 in this study shift at all. Therefore, we assume that strain or carrier coupling (charge transfer) effects at the interface of the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure are negligible.31,32 By the way, in previous reports, the interlayer interaction (strain or carrier coupling effect) occurs between stacking layers according to the relative angle.33–36 Although we did not observe this phenomenon, if the stacking angle is changed, it may affect the interlayer interaction.
To observe the electrical properties of few-layer ReS2 and WSe2, we fabricated few-layer ReS2 and WSe2 transistors (Fig. 2(a) and (b), respectively). Few-layer ReS2 and WSe2 were directly exfoliated onto a SiO2/Si wafer. The thicknesses of the few-layer ReS2 and WSe2 were ≈3.3 and ≈3.5 nm, respectively (see ESI, Fig. S1†). The inset in Fig. 2(a) shows an OM image of the few-layer ReS2 transistor. Cr/Au (5/50 nm) was used for the electrodes of the few-layer ReS2 transistor. Fig. 2(a) shows the drain–source current (Ids) and gate–source bias (Vgs) dependence of the few-layer ReS2 transistor under a drain–source bias (Vds) of 3 V. As indicated by the results, we observed an n-type characteristic and a high current on/off ratio (>7 × 107). Fig. 2(b) shows the gate dependence of the few-layer WSe2 transistor at Vds = 3 V, and the inset presents an OM image of the few-layer WSe2 transistor. Here, Au (50 nm) was used for the electrodes. The few-layer WSe2 transistor exhibits an ambipolar characteristic with an off-state around Vgs = −30 V.

The scale bar represents 5 μm. (d) Current-mapping image depending on the gate (Vgs) and drain bias (Vds). 

Fig. 2(c) shows the gate dependence of the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure at Vds = 3 V. We observed three sections along the current flow. (i) In the range of −60 V < Vgs < −40 V, the current increases (≈ 10−9 A) until Vgs ≈ −50 V and then decreases (≈ 10−11 A). (ii) Around Vgs = −35 V, the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure does not permit current flow. (iii) Finally, the current increases again in the range of −35 V < Vgs, and the current is saturated in the range of 0 V < Vgs (≈ 10−6 A). To analyze the current flow in detail, we performed current mapping depending on Vgs and Vds, as shown in Fig. 2(d). Ids was expressed in logarithmic form, in the range of 10−17 to 10−4 A. As shown in Fig. 2(d), the few-layer ReS2 channel has an off-state around Vgs = −60 V. Thus, the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure has a low current under both forward and reverse bias. This structure exhibited p–n diode characteristics in the range of −60 V < Vgs < −30 V. It has a high current under the forward bias and a low current under the reverse bias, because few-layer ReS2 has an n-type characteristic and few-layer WSe2 has a p-type characteristic in this region. Fig. S2† shows the rectification behavior with respect to the gate bias in detail. Around Vgs = −30 V, the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure does not permit the current flow, because the few-layer WSe2 is in the off-state. Therefore, the current increase and decrease in regions (i) and (ii) of Fig. 2(c) can be explained by the off-state. Above Vgs = −30 V, the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure shows the n–n junction characteristic, because few-layer ReS2 and WSe2 have n-type characteristics. Therefore, it has a high current under a forward and a reverse bias (region (iii) in Fig. 2(c) and (d)).
We further analyzed the p-n regime in the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure. The Ids–Vds curve was measured at Vgs = −50 V (Fig. 3(a)). The few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure shows outstanding rectification behavior because few-layer ReS2 has the n-type characteristic and few-layer WSe2 has the p-type characteristic under the negative gate bias (Vgs = −50 V). The forward/reverse current ratio is 7 × 102 as shown in Fig. 3(a). Our few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure has a comparable rectification ratio to other TMDC diode structures such as MoS2/WSe2, ReS2/ReSe2, MoTe2/SnSe2, and MoS2/MoTe2.18,19,37,38

To estimate the detailed carrier-transfer mechanisms of the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure, Fig. 3(b) is fitted by a logarithmic function of Ids and Vds. The blue line indicates the reverse bias current depending on the applied bias. The few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure has a low current under the reverse bias because the depletion region and band barrier are increased depending on the applied reverse bias. Therefore, the carrier transfer is limited by the high barrier at the interface. The generated carriers related to the low current are the minority carriers of the few-layer ReS2 and WSe2.32 The related band diagrams are shown in Fig. 3(d). The red line (forward bias) in Fig. 3(b) shows the three sections depending on the applied bias due to the inversion of the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure. This phenomenon appears or disappears depending on the gate bias (see ESI, Fig. S3†). As shown in Fig. 2(a)–(c), the few-layer ReS2 and WSe2 have different charge characteristics because of their different carrier densities. Therefore, we assume that the difference in the carrier density induces the inversion.32,39 The carrier density (electron(n), hole(p)) is estimated as follows.nReS2(pWSe2) = q−1Cox|Vth| = 5.37 × 1012(2.3 × 1012)
Here, q, Cox, and Vth are the electron charge, the capacitance of the 300 nm-thick SiO2 layer (1.23 × 10−8 F cm−2), and the threshold voltage, respectively. Because the few-layer WSe2 has a lower carrier density than the few-layer ReS2, the band of the few-layer WSe2 is more bent after contact, as shown in Fig. 3(d). When the forward bias is applied, (i) the current slowly increases and is linearly proportional to Vds under the low forward bias. In this region, the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure is operated by the direct tunneling induced by thermionic emission.32,40 (ii) The second region shows a significant current increase depending on the applied bias, as the forward bias affects the reduction of the barrier height and width. The reduced and narrow barrier induces the F–N tunneling.16,32,41 Therefore, the electrons easily move from the few-layer ReS2 to the few-layer WSe2. The related band diagram is shown in Fig. 3(e). To confirm the F–N tunneling, we fitted the Ids–Vds curve of the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure as a function of the F–N tunneling equation. The F–N tunneling is expressed as follows.  
Here, d, m*, ∅, and ħ are the thickness of the barrier, the effective electron mass, the tunneling barrier, and the Planck constant, respectively.32,41,42 From this equation, Fig. 3(c) is obtained by plotting ln(Ids/Vds2) versus 1/Vds. The plot has two inflection points with a negative slope. This negative slope indicates that F–N tunneling occurs in the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure.32,41,43 We estimated the F–N tunneling range according to two inflection points. The F–N tunneling range is 1/8 V < Vds < 1/3 V ((ii) 0.13 V < Vds < 0.3 V). In Fig. 3(b), (iii) the high current is shown depending on the applied bias (0.3 V < Vds < 3 V), as the barrier is reduced (Fig. 3(b) and (e)). The few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure is operated by injected carriers and space charge.32,43,44 According to electrical measurements, we identified the carrier-transfer mechanism for the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure.
We performed Ids–Vds measurements using a 405 nm laser to confirm the optoelectronic characteristics depending on the incident power (Pin). Fig. 4(a) shows a schematic of the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure under the incident laser (405 nm). All measurements were conducted under high vacuum (below 10−5 Torr), at Vgs = −50 V and room temperature. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure exhibits the photovoltaic effect. The short-circuit current (Isc) increases depending on the incident power increase because of photo-generated carriers.15,18,45 Under the open-circuit voltage (Voc) conditions (Isc = 0 A), the carrier concentrations are related to the photogeneration (G) and interlayer recombination (R). According to the G and R relations, we calculated the recombination order (β) as follows.18,46

(c) Electrical power (Pel) with an incident laser power (Pin) between 3.2 and 56 W/m2. (d) FF with respect to the incident laser power (Pin). 
From this calculation, we obtained β ≈ 1.2. β = 1 and 2 correspond to monomolecular (Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH)) recombination and bimolecular (Langevin) recombination, respectively.18 According to the calculation result, our device operates mainly via SRH recombination. Therefore, we estimated that our device operation is affected by the trap states. Fig. S4† shows Isc and Voc with respect to the incident laser power.
From the Ids–Vds curve in Fig. 4(b), the electrical power (Pel = Voc × Isc) is extracted using Fig. 4(c). As a result, Pel is increased depending on the incident power. Fig. 4(d) shows the FF (FF = Pel,max/IscVoc, where Pel,max is the maximum electrical power). The highest FF (FFmax) is ≈0.56, and the average FF (FFaverage) is ≈0.54. The PCE is defined as PCE = Pel,max/Pin. The highest PCE is ≈1.5% (Pin = 40 W m−2), and the average PCE is ≈1.3%. Additionally, we observed the photovoltaic effect of the few-layer ReS2/monolayer WSe2 heterostructure as shown in Fig. S5.†
To further evaluate the optoelectronics, we calculated Rph and EQE. Rph is defined as Rph = Isc/(PinA), where A is the effective area of the device. The Rph of our device is 50 mA W−1 (Pin = 15.7 W m−2). The EQE is expressed as follows.  
Here, h, c, and λ are the Planck constant, the speed of light, and the incident wavelength, respectively. As a result, EQE ≈ 15.3% is obtained at an incident power of 15.7 W m−2. According to the optoelectronic results, we obtained a high-performance few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure with a high PCE (≈ 1.5%) that is three times higher than that of a recently reported ReS2/ReSe2 heterostructure.19 Even though this efficiency value is low compared with recent approaches for high-efficiency solar cells, this work paves the way for achieving high-efficiency and long-lasting inorganic flexible photovoltaic devices.
Conclusions
The device composed of few-layer ReS2 and WSe2 has different characteristics, such as (i) a p–n region, (ii) an off-state, and (iii) an n–n region depending on the gate bias. In the p–n region, the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure shows a current increase and decrease, because the few-layer WSe2 enters the off-state around Vgs = −30 V. Through the current-mapping image, the p–n region of the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure is verified. According to the results, the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure exhibits outstanding rectification behavior at Vgs = −50 V (rectification ratio ≈7 × 102). Regarding the diode characteristics, we explained the carrier-transfer mechanisms. The few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure exhibits (i) direct tunneling, (ii) F–N tunneling, and (iii) a space charge region depending on Vds. According to the fitting of the F–N tunneling equation, a negative slope and two inflection points were obtained. These results confirmed that F–N tunneling occurred in the few-layer ReS2 and WSe2 interface owing to the inversion. Finally, we observed the optoelectrical properties of the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure under a negative gate bias (Vgs = −50 V). A high FF (≈ 0.56), PCE (≈ 1.5%) and EQE (≈ 15.3%) were obtained.
Methods
Fabrication of the few-layer ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure
Few-layer ReS2 was directly exfoliated onto the Si wafer with a 300 nm silicon dioxide layer to form the bottom layer. Additionally, few-layer WSe2 was exfoliated onto another SiO2 substrate coated with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) for the top layer. Since the PVA polymer is dissolved in water and the PMMA is removed with acetone, the ReS2/WSe2 heterostructure was fabricated via a typical dry-transfer process. Electrodes were patterned by electron-beam lithography. Cr/Au (5/50 nm) was used for the few-layer ReS2 electrode (n-type) and Au (50 nm) was used for the few-layer WSe2 electrode (ambipolar). The SiO2 substrate was used for the gate material.
Characterization
The thickness and topology of the samples were confirmed via AFM. All of the Raman spectra were observed under a 532 nm laser (Nanobase and NTMDT). The Raman mapping images were obtained with an exposure time of 400 ms. For the electrical measurements, the system consisted of four probes (Keithley 4200 series) and a vacuum chamber (≈ 10−6 Torr). The same system and a 405 nm laser were used for obtaining optoelectronic data.
