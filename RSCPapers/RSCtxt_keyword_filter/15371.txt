    , Accepted 5th April 2017First published on 5th April 2017AbstractIn this work, a new wide-bandgap polymer, PSBZ, based on thienyl substituted benzodithiophene (BDTT) as the donor unit and difluorobenzotriazole (BTz-2F) as the acceptor unit was synthesized for photovoltaic applications. Compared to the analogous polymer J61 with linear dodecylthio side chains in the BDTT unit and a long 2-hexyldecyl side chain in BTz-2F, PSBZ possesses branched 2-butyloctyl side chains to increase steric hindrance of the BDTT unit and a short 2-butyloctyl side chain to decrease steric hindrance of the BTz-2F unit for more efficient charge separation and transport in the devices. As a result, PSBZ exhibited stronger π–π interaction and smaller stacking spacing leading to a higher extinction coefficient of 1.48 × 105 cm−1 and a high hole mobility of 8.56 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Compared to the analogous polymer J61 with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.53% and a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.43 mA cm−2, the PSBZ:ITIC-based polymer solar cells yielded a higher PCE of 10.5% with a higher Jsc of 19.0 mA cm−2. The results show that our design strategy is successful for improving photovoltaic performance by side chain engineering.
Over the last two decades, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous attention due to their potential applications in the mass fabrication of flexible device panels by roll-to-roll printing.1–5 Nowadays, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10% have been reported for different types of single-junction PSCs.6–11 To further improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, great efforts have been devoted to the design, synthesis and optimization of the properties of polymer donor materials, such as suitable molecular energy levels and absorption band, desirable crystallinity, high extinction coefficients and hole mobility, and so on.12,13 From the point of view of molecular design, the optimization of solubilizing alkyl chains has been proved to be one of the most important issues.1b,14–17 The variations of the topology (e.g., linear and branched),15 size16 and substitution position17 of alkyl chains are able to adjust the solubility and improve intermolecular stacking and mobility.
In general, for the purpose of ensuring solubility, short alkyl side chains are conducive to the formation of strong intermolecular interactions for ordered and close intermolecular packing and good crystallinity.15,16,18 As a result, the related polymers can achieve a significantly improved short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) compared to those polymers with long alkyl chains.15,16,18 Specifically, plenty of previous studies indicate that donor–acceptor (D–A) polymers with higher Jsc and PCE generally consist of acceptor units that are sterically approachable for interactions with n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) materials, whereas the corresponding donor units tend to have branched alkyl substituents that sterically hinder interactions with n-OS materials,14–16,18,19 probably resulting from that the wave function overlap between the acceptor units of the D–A polymer and n-OS materials which will lead to a faster rate of charge transfer and a slower rate of charge recombination in the devices when n-OS materials are in closer proximity to the acceptor unit.19 Therefore, the selection of alkyl side chains in D–A polymers is very essential for the improvement of photovoltaic performance.
Recently, a wide-bandgap polymer, named J61 (see Scheme 1), based on thienyl substituted benzodithiophene (BDTT) with linear dodecylthio side chains as the donor unit and difluorobenzotriazole (BTz-2F) with a long branched 2-hexyldecyl side chain as the acceptor unit, has been reported by Bin et al. for application in ITIC-based nonfullerene PSCs, which have achieved a PCE of 9.53% with a Jsc of 17.43 mA cm−2.13 However, taking into account the complementary absorption spectra and the matched energy levels between J61 and ITIC, the Jsc of J61 is still at a relatively low level, which was the limiting factor for further improvement of the PCE. Therefore, in this work, we designed and synthesized a new wide-bandgap polymer, PSBZ (as shown in Scheme 1), by introducing branched 2-butyloctylthio side chains to increase steric hindrance in the BDTT unit and a short branched 2-butyloctyl side chain to decrease steric hindrance in the BTz-2F unit. As expected, compared to the analogous polymer J61-based devices (with efficiencies of 9.15% and 9.53% for the non-annealed and annealed devices, respectively),13 the PSBZ-based devices with or without annealing show higher efficiencies of over 9.7% due to a significantly improved Jsc of more than 18.0 mA cm−2. As a result, the PSBZ:ITIC-based PSCs with annealing exhibit a high PCE of 10.5% with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 19.0 mA cm−2 and a FF of 62%.
 Scheme 1  Molecular structures of the reference polymer J61, the target polymer PSBZ and nonfullerene material ITIC; and synthetic routes of polymer PSBZ. 
The synthesis routes of PSBZ are shown in Scheme 1. The synthesis procedures and characterization of BDTTS and PSBZ are described in the ESI.† High temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis of PSBZ showed a number average molecular weight (Mn) of 30.5 kDa with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.28. Moreover, PSBZ exhibits excellent solubility in chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB). As shown in the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) plot (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†), PSBZ shows a decomposition temperature (Td) of 385 °C with 5% weight loss. No obvious exotherms or endotherms were observed from 75 to 275 °C in the differential scanning calorimetry test of PSBZ (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†).

Fig. 1a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of PSBZ in ODCB solutions at different temperatures and in thin film. In solution, the absorption intensity of the shoulder peak gradually decreases with the temperature increasing from 25 to 110 °C, which indicates that PSBZ can form strong and stable intermolecular aggregation in low temperature solutions. Moreover, PSBZ still shows an obvious shoulder peak at 110 °C, which means that PSBZ possesses stable intermolecular ordered packing at higher temperature. In thin film, PSBZ shows a red-shifted and enhanced vibronic absorption peak. Furthermore, compared to polymer J61 with an extinction coefficient of 8.6 × 10−4 cm−1 at 600 nm in thin film,13 the PSBZ film shows a higher extinction coefficient of 1.48 × 105 cm−1 at 599 nm (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†), which is conducive to obtaining a higher Jsc value in the PSBZ-based devices. Notably, PSBZ and J61 films show the same bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.93 eV, which means that the change of alkyl chains has a tiny effect on the absorption spectra of the polymers. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PSBZ are determined to be −5.37 eV and −3.47 eV by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (see Fig. S4 in the ESI†) according to the empirical equations20EHOMO = −(Eox + 4.71) (eV) and ELUMO = −(Ered + 4.71) (eV), respectively. As shown in Fig. 1b, the LUMO level gap between PSBZ and the ITIC is 0.38 eV, which provides a powerful driving force for charge separation at the D/A interface.
 Fig. 1  (a) UV-vis absorption spectra of PSBZ in ODCB solutions at different temperatures, and PSBZ and ITIC in thin film; (b) molecular energy level diagram of PSBZ and ITIC; (c) XRD patterns of the pure PSBZ film. 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was carried out to study the intermolecular stacking of the pure polymer film, as shown in Fig. 1c. The PSBZ film shows a sharper and intense (100) diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.37° and a (010) diffraction peak at 2θ = 24.61°, and the corresponding d-spacing of 20.20 Å and π–π stacking distance of 3.61 Å are smaller than those of the J61 film (d-spacing of 26.11 Å and π–π stacking distance of 3.65 Å).13 These results suggest that the topology of the alkyl substituents affects the aggregation state, i.e., branched alkylthio chains in the BDTT unit and the short branched chain in the BTz-2F unit for PSBZ promote lamellar packing and π–π stacking in comparison with J61. Meanwhile, PSBZ also shows a high hole mobility of 8.56 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (see Fig. S5 in the ESI†).
The photovoltaic properties of PSBZ were investigated by fabricating PSC devices with an inverted structure of ITO/ZnO/PSBZ:ITIC/MoO3/Al. The detailed optimization processes of the devices are recorded in Fig. S6 and Table S2 in the ESI† for the D/A blend ratios and Fig. S7 and Table S3 in the ESI† for the thermal annealing temperatures. As shown in Fig. 2a and Table 1, the PSBZ:ITIC-based PSC without any post-treatment delivers a PCE of 9.7% with a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 18.0 mA cm−2, and a FF of 60%. Compared to the non-annealed devices based on J61:ITIC, the PSBZ:ITIC-based devices show an enhanced PCE value from 9.15% to 9.7% due to a substantial increase of the Jsc value from 14.95 to 18.0 mA cm−2. Furthermore, the device based on PSBZ:ITIC with thermal annealing at 140 °C for 10 min shows a higher PCE of 10.5% due to the further promotion of Jsc values from 18.0 to 19.0 mA cm−2. Obviously, the Jsc of 19.0 mA cm−2 and PCE of 10.5% for the PSBZ:ITIC-based PSCs are higher than those of the annealed PSCs based on J61:ITIC (Jsc of 17.43 mA cm−2 and PCE of 9.53%),13 which means that our design strategy is successful for improving photovoltaic performance by side chain engineering.

The high Jsc values of the devices can be confirmed from their external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra. As shown in Fig. 2b, all the devices show a broad EQE photo-response in the wavelength range of ca. 300–800 nm, while the annealed devices show higher EQE values in the whole absorption spectra compared with the non-annealed devices. The maximum EQE value reached 86% at 565 nm for the annealed devices, indicating efficient photon-harvesting and charge collection within the cell. Moreover, the devices display high EQE values in the range of ca. 600–800 nm, which indicates that efficient hole transfer happened from ITIC to PSBZ despite the EHOMO difference between PSBZ and ITIC being only 0.23 eV. Similar phenomena have been reported in other ITIC-based PSCs.13 The integral Jsc values calculated from the EQE curves were quite consistent with the measured Jsc within 5% error.
The charge carrier mobilities of the blend films in the PSCs were also measured by the SCLC method (see Fig. S5 and Table S1 in the ESI†). The annealed devices show higher and more balanced hole/electron mobilities (μh/μe) compared with the non-annealed devices, which is conducive to obtaining higher Jsc and FF in the PSC devices. Moreover, a high μh/μe of 1.70/1.16 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 with a small μh/μe ratio of 1.5 was recorded for the devices based on PSBZ:ITIC, which was approximately 2 times higher than that of the J61:ITIC-based devices.13 The above results are consistent with the high PCE and Jsc values of the PSBZ:ITIC-based devices.
The relationship of Voc with light intensity (P) was determined to reveal the charge recombination mechanism in PSCs.21 The slope of Vocversus logP at 2 kBT/q indicates that the dominant recombination mechanism is trap-assisted or monomolecular recombination, while the slope of kBT/q means that only bimolecular recombination takes place in the devices (where kB, q and T are the Boltzmann constant, elementary charge and temperature in Kelvin, respectively). As shown in Fig. 2c, the slopes of 1.08 and 1.56 kBT/q were obtained for the annealed device and the non-annealed device, respectively, which indicate that trap-assisted or monomolecular recombination is weaker in the annealed device in comparison with the non-annealed device. Moreover, the slope of 1.08 kBT/q for the annealed device is very close to that of kBT/q, which means that the bimolecular recombination is dominant in the device.
As shown in Fig. 2d, the Jsc values under different P were also measured in order to study the charge recombination behavior under the short-circuit conditions of the cells. In general, the relationship between Jsc and P can be defined as Jsc ∝ PS. If all free carriers are swept out and collected at the electrodes prior to recombination, slope (S) should be equal to 1, while S < 1 indicates the existence of bimolecular recombination.12 In logarithmic coordinates, the Jsc shows a linear dependence on the light intensity. The annealed device shows a higher S value of 0.945 compared to the non-annealed device (an S value of 0.923), which means that bimolecular recombination was significantly suppressed by the annealing treatment. The suppressed charge recombination correlates well with the balanced carrier mobilities inside the devices mentioned above and should partially account for the higher FF and Jsc of the related device.
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the pure PSBZ film and PSBZ:ITIC blends were measured for investigating the photo-induced electron transfer behavior between PSBZ and ITIC. As shown in Fig. 2d–f, the PSBZ:ITIC blends demonstrated more than 90% PL quenching in comparison with the pure PSBZ or ITIC. Moreover, the annealed device shows a higher PL quenching compared to the non-annealed device. High PL quenching efficiency indicates that the devices possess effective photo-induced charge transfer between PSBZ and ITIC, which is consistent with the high Jsc values of the devices.
To understand the surface and bulk morphologies of the blend films, we carried out atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements, as shown in Fig. 3. For the AFM images, the root-mean-square (RMS) values are 1.28 and 1.49 nm for the blend films without or with thermal annealing, respectively. Moreover, it can be clearly seen that there are high pure phase regions of the polymer in the two-dimensional AFM images, which further confirms the high crystallinity of PSBZ. After annealing, the blend film shows an increased phase region size of the pure polymer, which is consistent with the trend of the RMS values of the blend film with annealing. In the TEM images, the bright and the dark regions are PSBZ-rich and ITIC-rich domains, respectively. The blend film with annealing shows an obvious fibrillar structure compared to the blend film without annealing, which is beneficial to charge separation and transport and hence to achieve the higher Jsc and FF. This result is consistent with the trend of the AFM measurements of the blend film with annealing.

In conclusion, a new wide-bandgap polymer, PSBZ, based on BDTTS with branched alkylthio side chains as the donor unit and BTz-2F as the acceptor unit was synthesized for photovoltaic applications. Compared to the analogous polymer J61 with linear alkylthio side chains, PSBZ possesses branched 2-butyloctyl side chains to increase steric hindrance of the BDTTS unit and a short 2-butyloctyl side chain to decrease steric hindrance in the BTz-2F unit for more efficient charge separation and transport in the devices. As a result, PSBZ exhibited stronger π–π interaction and smaller stacking spacing leading to a higher extinction coefficient of 1.48 × 105 cm−1 and a high hole mobility of 8.56 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. Compared to the analogous polymer J61, the PSBZ:ITIC-based PSCs yielded a higher PCE of 10.5% with a Voc of 0.89 V, a Jsc of 19.0 mA cm−2 and a FF of 62%. The results show that our design strategy is successful in improving photovoltaic performance by side chain engineering.
