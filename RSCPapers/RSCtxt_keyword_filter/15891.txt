    , Accepted 3rd June 2011First published on 14th June 2011AbstractThe combination of some non-iodine one-electron outer-sphere redox shuttles with high-absorption-coefficient organic D–π–A dyes has very recently brought forth a new opportunity towards efficiency enhancement of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Thereby a comprehensive understanding on the structure–property relationship of metal-free organic photosensitizers will play a pivotal role in further development of high-efficiency devices iodine-free. Herein, we scrutinize some general influences of the cyanoacrylic-acid-anchoring-group number of organic dyes upon the optoelectronic features of mesoscopic titania solar cells based on the tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II/III) redox shuttle, by employing three pairs of uniped and biped dyes with thiophene, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene and 4,4-dihexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene as the π-conjugated spacers. It is found that regardless of the spacer selection, a biped dye confers an improved light absorption coefficient of a stained titania film in comparison with its uniped analogue, which is highly desirable for cells with a one-electron outer-sphere redox shuttle, because in this type of cells a very thin titania film is always needed to satisfy the mass transport and electron collection requirements. However, our electrical impedance analyses have revealed that the alteration from a uniped chromophore to its biped congener evokes not only a downward displacement of the titania conduction band edge but also an acceleration of interfacial charge recombination of the titania electrons with cobalt(III) ions, leading to an attenuated open-circuit photovoltage, highlighting the future necessity to design a sterically bulky organic dye featuring superior light-harvesting capacity.

Broader context
The iodide/triiodide redox couple, as a so far unmatched choice in formulating efficient electrolytes of dye-sensitized solar cells, is of paramount importance in attaining the certified efficiency record of 11.2%. In pursut of further efficiency improvement however, the conventional iodine electrolytes have displayed some prominent constraints on the development of counter electrodes and especially new dyes owing to the possible presence of halogen bonding, which considerably accelerates interfacial charge recombination and thus reduces the cell photovoltage. Recent progress on outer-sphere one-electron redox shuttle have opened a new avenue for the rapid development of dye-sensitized solar cells. However, a high absorption coefficient, wide-spectral response and slow charge recombination dye are desirable for this type of cell. In this paper, we study the structure–property relationship of uniped and biped dyes in mesoscopic titania solar cells with the tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt redox shuttle, shedding light on the future rational design of more powerful push–pull dyes.

1. Introduction
In the past decade metal-free organic D–π–A dyes have been intensely explored for mesoscopic titania solar cells1 mainly based on a conventional iodine electrolyte, with impressive progress in terms of cell efficiency.2–6 However, the iodide/triiodide redox couple poses some limitations on the dye design for further efficiency enhancement, apart from its corrosiveness to many metal current collectors. For example, the halogen bonding7 between iodine and some electron-rich segments of dye molecules could cause a larger charge recombination rate at the titania/electrolyte interface, shortening the electron diffusion length and more critically reducing the cell photovoltage.8–10 In addition, the notable redox potential discrepancy between the iodide/diiodide radical couple which participates in dye regeneration and the iodide/triiodide couple which determines the electrolyte Fermi-level, has led to a noticeable potential loss.11 The latter issue will restrict the development of low energy-gap DSC dyes with an up-lifted highest occupied molecular orbital. Note that a considerably downwards shifting of the lowest unoccupied molecule orbital to obtain infrared dyes may not be a wise strategy, in consideration of the driving force for electron injection in titania solar cells.
Recognition of this dilemma in mesoscopic titania solar cells has very recently greatly impelled the device advancement of organic dye-sensitized solar cells based on non-iodine redox electrolytes. By employing a bulky organic chromophore in conjunction with the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple, Udo and Spiccia et al. have demonstrated the feasibility of fabricating a 7.5%-efficiency DSC measured under simulated AM1.5 full sunlight conditions.12 Subsequent combinations of the tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt(II/III) and bis(2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline)copper(I/II) redox shuttles with some organic dyes have also generated impressive efficiencies of 6.7%13 and 7.0%,14 respectively. Encouraged by the work done by Boschloo et al.,13 we also deployed our model organic dye C218 to prove the significant value of employing the cobalt redox shuttles in dye-sensitized solar cells by demonstrating an 8.3% cell with a very preliminary testing.15 Note that for all these iodine-free cells, a relatively thin titania film must be applied to meet the requirements of redox couple mass transport and electron collection, owing to the bulky cobalt species and the short electron diffusion length, respectively.16 These recent advances in cobalt DSCs should be partly ascribed to the alternation of ruthenium sensitizers deployed in earlier studies17 with organic dyes13,15 to enhance the absorption coefficient of dye-coated titania films.
Amongst the various tactics towards high-absorptivity chromophores, of special interest is the utilization of a biped anchoring group18–21 although its initial motivation consists in enhancing the binding strength of dye molecules with titania. In this paper, we will systematically investigate the energetic and kinetic impacts of the cyanoacrylic-acid-anchoring-group number of organic D–π–A dyes upon the optoelectronic features of mesoscopic titania solar cells based on the tri(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II/III) redox shuttle, by employing three pairs of uniped and biped dyes (Fig. 1) with thiophene, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) and 4,4-dihexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) as the π-conjugated blocks.

          Light absorption
        
We first recorded the electronic absorption spectra (Fig. 2A) of these six dyes dissolved in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and tert-butanol (v/v 1/1) and collected some spectroscopic parameters in Table 1. With respect to the uniped chromophores, the maximum absorption wavelengths of the biped counterparts are red-shifted by 11, 14 and 5 nm for the thiophene, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene and 4,4-dihexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene π-spacers, respectively. Moreover, it is also valuable to note that these biped dyes possess noticeably enhanced maximum absorption coefficients relative to those of their uniped congeners, being consistent with previous observations.18–21

Considering that either solvent polarity or deprotonation of dye molecules upon grafting on titania can affect intramolecular charge transfer transitions, we also measured the electronic absorption spectra of dye-coated titania films permeated with the realistic Co-1 electrolyte15 for cell fabrication, which is composed of 0.3 M tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt di[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide] (Co(phen)3[TFSI]2), 0.1 M nitrosonium tetrafluoroborate (NOBF4), 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 0.1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) in acetonitrile. As shown in Fig. 2B, aside from the red-shifted maximum absorption wavelengths (Table 1), the biped dyes also display higher absorption coefficients than their uniped counterparts in the whole visible region, which is of special significance for DSCs containing bulky redox mediators because in these cells a relatively thin titania film is employed so as to avoid the mass transport limitation of cobalt(II/III) ions and to minimize interfacial charge recombination.16,17 Note that, compared to a dye solution, a hypsochromic effect (Table 1) is noted for a dye coated titania film, which can be partially caused by a weaker electron-withdrawing capacity of the carboxylate-titanium assembly compared to the carboxylic-acid group.
2.2. Charge transfer dynamics of oxidized dye molecules
A 2-μm-thick, dye-coated nanocrystalline titania film was combined with an inert electrolyte (0.1 M LiTFSI and 0.5 M TBP in acetonitrile) to construct a dummy cell for the measurement of a transient absorption spectrum with an ICCD camera. As Fig. 3 presents, upon laser excitation all stained titania films display strong electronic absorption in the near-infrared region (Fig. 2B). On account of the sensitivity of our PMT detector, a 782-nm probe light was applied in the subsequent kinetic measurements, investigating the dual-channel charge transfer dynamics of oxidized dye molecules, i.e., their interception22,23 by either titania electrons or cobalt(II) ions in the Co-1 electrolyte. Excitation fluences were carefully controlled in our experiments to ensure that ∼2.0 × 1013photons were absorbed by a dye-coated titania film during every laser pulse. Also, the pump wavelengths were chosen according to the optical density of ∼0.2 for each dye-coated mesoscopic titania film, ensuring a similar electron distribution profile in the studied samples.
 Fig. 3  Transient absorption spectra recorded with an intensified charge coupled detector (ICCD) of 2-μm-thick, dye-coated titania films immersed in an inert electrolyte. Grey baselines are included for clarity of presentation. 
We first fabricated control cells with 10-μm-thick, dye-coated titania films in conjunction with the aforementioned inert electrolyte, which all display millisecond absorption decays (traces a–f, Fig. 4) due to the slow back electron transfer reactions from titania to oxidized dye molecules. Further substituting the inert electrolyte with the Co-1 electrolyte yields remarkably accelerated absorption decays (traces g–l), owing to the occurrence of expeditious electron donation from cobalt(II) ions to oxidized dye molecules. Herein we used a stretched exponential decay function (ΔA ∝ A0exp[−(t/τ)α]) to fit the kinetic traces, where A0 is a pre-exponential factor, and the mean lifetimes (Table 2) of the back electron transfer (<τ > BET) and dye regeneration (<τ>DR) processes were calculated with <τ> = (τ/α)Γ(1/α),24 where Γ(x) is the gamma function.

It can be noticed that <τ>BET is not too much affected by increasing the cyanoacrylic-acid-anchoring-group number from one to two, regardless of the π-spacer selection. The <τ>DR values, however, are ∼3-fold smaller in cells with the biped dyes than the corresponding uniped counterparts, indicative of a faster cobalt(II) interception of oxidized biped dye molecules. The apparent anchoring-group-number dependent dye regeneration kinetics could be rationalized by comparing the ground-state redox potentials (VD+/D, Table 2) of dye molecules grafted on titania films derived from square-wave voltammograms (Fig. S2). Apparently, owing to a noticeably more positive VD+/D, the utilization of a biped chromophore introduces an at least 0.05 V larger reaction free energy than that of its uniped counterpart, facilitating the electron transfer from cobalt(II) ions to oxidized dye molecules. Additionally, by analysing the <τ>DR and VD+/D values (Table 2) of these six dyes, we could derive that the dye regeneration reaction occurs in the Marcus normal region.25,26 In spite of the dye dependent dual-channel charge transfer kinetics of oxidized dye molecules, the kinetic branch ratios are over 100 for all of these dyes, guaranteeing efficient dye regeneration.
2.3. Photovoltaic performance and electrical impedance analyses
The photocurrent action spectra of cells fabricated from these uniped and biped dyes in conjunction with our Co-1 electrolyte are presented in Fig. 5, where the incident photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) is plotted as a function of the wavelength (λ). The IPCE is known as an accumulative product of the wavelength-dependent light-harvesting and charge collection efficiencies, and the wavelength-independent efficiency of net charge separation at the dye/titania interface. Thereby normalizing the photocurrent action spectrum relative to its summit can to a large extent disentangle the charge separation efficiency difference between a uniped photosensitizer and its biped counterpart. As shown in Fig. S2A,† the wavelength-dependent features of the normalized IPCEs for both thiophene and EDOT dyes are in good accord with their electronic absorptions. However, whilst the biped CPDT dye presents better light absorptions in the spectral coverage of 540–630 nm than its uniped congener, almost no difference of normalized IPCEs is found in this wavelength region, indicating that the use of two cyanoacrylic-acid-anchoring-groups in conjunction with CPDT could cause a certain decrease of the charge collection efficiency.
 Fig. 5  Plots of incident photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) as a function of wavelength (λ). Thickness of a bilayer titania film: 2.8 + 3.3 μm. The Co-1 electrolyte used here is composed of 0.3 M Co(phen)3[TFSI]2, 0.1 M NOBF4, 0.5 M TBP and 0.1 M LiTFSI in acetonitrile. Aperture area of a metal mask: 0.158 cm2. An antireflection film was adhered to the testing cell during measurement. 
We also recorded the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics (Fig. 6) of our cells at irradiation of the simulated 100 mW cm−2AM1.5 sunlight and listed the detailed photovoltaic parameters in Table 3. Being well consistent with the integrals of IPCEs over the standard AM1.5G solar emission spectrum, a biped dye prompts a higher short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) than its uniped counterpart upon utilizing the thiophene π-spacer, whilst the EDOT-based dyes present almost identical Jsc values. The CPDT-containing C218 dye evokes a Jsc of 13.26 mA cm−2, in contrast with that of 12.24 mA cm−2 for its biped analogue C233. On the other hand, it is generally noted that the uniped-to-biped dye alteration has caused open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) reductions of 0.16, 0.11 and 0.05 V in the cases of the thiophene, EDOT and CPDT conjugated spacers, respectively, leading to decreased power conversion efficiencies (η). Amongst these dyes, C218 exhibits the highest η of 8.6% at the AM1.5 full sunlight conditions.

a The spectral distribution of our light resource simulates the AM1.5 solar emission (ASTM G173-03). The validity of our data is further confirmed by comparing the overlap integral of the measured IPCE spectrum with the standard AM1.5 emission spectrum and the experimental Jsc, showing a less than 5% error. Note that there is a liner dependence of Jsc on light intensity in all cells.

For a DSC with a fixed redox electrolyte, its Voc is determined by the quasi-Fermi-level (EF,n) of the mesoporous titania film, which intimately correlates to the titania conduction band edge (Ec) and free electron density n viaeqn (1),9 (1)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature and Nc of 7 × 1020 cm−3 used here is the density of accessible states in the titania conduction band. Note that in a steady-state DSC, n is determined by the kinetic balance between photocurrent generation and interfacial charge recombination.
To figure out the influence of the number of cyanoacrylic-acid anchoring-group on Ec, we first derived the chemical capacitance (Cμ) (Fig. 7A) of a mesoporous titania film through measuring the electrical impedance spectroscopies of our cells, which can be expressed as an exponential function of potential bias (V),27,28 (2)where Nt of 2 × 1020 cm−3 is the total density of interband states,28e the elementary charge, d of 2.8 μm is the thickness of the transparent titania layer and p of 0.64 obtained from the BET measurement is the film porosity. Fitting the Cμ data to eqn (2) gives the energy difference of Ec–EF,redox, as listed in Table 4. The energetic diagrams of these cells are depicted in Fig. 7B. With respect to the uniped dyes, the use of the biped analogues has prompted downward Ec displacements of 0.07, 0.04 and 0.01 eV in the cases of the thiophene, EDOT and CPDT spacers, respectively. Note that these Ec shifts could apparently account only in part for the remarkable EF,n variations (Fig. 7B). The remaining EF,n differences are ascribed to dissimilar free carrier densities (Table 4), which can be roughly evaluated with nc = Ncexp{[Voc−(Ec − EF,redox)]/kBT}.29

Moreover, in view of the comparable Jsc (Table 3), i.e. the electron injection fluxes, of uniped/biped dyes, we attribute the lower n levels in DSCs with biped dyes to faster charge recombination at the titania/electrolyte interface. To corroborate this assumption, we compare the effective charge recombination rate constants U0k30 of these cells, the derivation of which has been addressed by Bisquert et al.31 through a proper analysis of interfacial charge transfer resistance Rct. On the basis of the recently proposed β-recombination model,32Rct can be expressed as30 (3)where A refers to the cell area (0.2826 cm2) and β is the reaction order of titania electrons. Thereby Rct was further modelled from impedance spectroscopies as a function of applied potential bias, as shown in Fig. 8. Fitting the Rct data to eqn (3) yields the U0k values as listed in Table 4.

Evidently, the dye alterations from C213 to C231, C230 to C232 and C218 to C233 have resulted in 164, 70 and 21-fold increased recombination rate constants, respectively, accounting for the observed n differences. We suspect that the faster charge recombination kinetics in DSCs with biped dyes is probably related to the decreased ratio of the hexyloxy group number to the anchoring group number, which could weaken the steric blocking towards cobalt(III) ions.
Moreover, by reducing the NOBF4 concentration from 100 to 75 mM to formulate a new cobalt electrolyte (Co-2), we could fabricate a more efficient DSC based on the high-absorption-coefficient C218 dye. As shown in Fig. 9, Jsc, Voc and FF of the optimized cell are 13.03 mA cm−2, 0.89 V and 0.77, affording an impressive η of 8.9%. Compared to the DSC employing the Co-1 electrolyte, the efficiency enhancement attained here is primarily due to a 0.03 V improvement of open-circuit photovoltage, apart from an increase of fill factor.

The electrolyte related Voc variation is understood through analysing the chemical capacitance and interfacial charge transfer resistance in a similar course as above. Analysis of the Cμ data (Fig. 10A) affords a Ec − EF,redox value of 1.18 eV for the Co-2 cell, which is 0.01 V larger than that of the Co-1 cell (Table 4). By applying eqn (3) to fit the Rct data (Fig. 10B), the U0k of the Co-2 cell was obtained as 2.3 × 1023 cm−3s−1, which is roughly two times smaller than that of the Co-1 counterpart (4.2 × 1023 cm−3s−1), authenticating our motif to attenuate charge recombination by reducing the cobalt(III) concentration.

3. Conclusions
To summarize, on the basis of three pairs of uniped and biped organic D–π–A dyes characteristic of the thiophene, 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene and 4,4-dihexyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene conjugated spacers, we have investigated some general impacts of the number of cyanoacrylic-acid anchoring-group on the optoelectronic features of dye-sensitized solar cells employing the non-corrosive one-electron outer-sphere tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II/III) redox shuttle. The impressive efficiency of 8.9% attained with a cobalt electrolyte has reached a level similar to that achieved for an optimized iodine cell using the same C218 dye in conjunction with a much thicker titania film.33 Compared to the uniped photosensitizers, the corresponding biped dyes exhibit hyperchromic light absorptions in the visible region upon anchoring on titania nanocrystals. Unfortunately, with respect to the uniped dyes, the utilization of the biped congeners has given rise to noticeable reductions of open-circuit photovoltage, due to a combined effect of a dye-correlated negative shift of titania conduction band edge and a kinetic acceleration of the charge recombination at the titania/electrolyte interface. Our work should shed light on the future design of more powerful push–pull organic photosensitizers for iodine-free dye-sensitizer solar cells.
4. Experimental
4.1. Materials

Acetonitrile and tert-butanol were distilled before use. Cyanoacetic acid, piperidine, LiTFSI, NOBF4 and TBP were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Co(phen)3[TFSI]217b and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethane-sulfonyl)imide34 were synthesized according to literature methods. The scattering TiO2 paste (WER2-O) was received as a gift from Dyesol.
4.2. Synthesis and characterization of dyes
The uniped C213 and C218 dyes have been reported in our previous publications.33,35 The uniped dye C230 and biped dyes C231–C233 were synthesized via the Knoevenagel condensation reaction in fairly high yields. The synthetic routes were shown in Scheme S1 and the detailed syntheses of intermediates are described in the ESI.†

General synthetic procedure for the uniped and biped dyes. 
To a stirred solution of 2 or 9 (1 mmol) and cyanoacetic acid (3 mmol for 2 and 6 mmol for 9) in chloroform (30 mL) was added piperidine (7 mmol for 2 and 14 mmol for 9). The reaction mixture was refluxed under argon for 24 h and then acidified with 2 M hydrochloric acid aqueous solution (30 mL). The crude product was extracted into chloroform, washed with water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After removing the solvent under reduced pressure, the residue was washed with methanol/chloroform (1/30, v/v) and methanol/chloroform (1/20, v/v) in turn as the eluent to yield the product.

4.3. Spectroscopic and voltammetric measurements
Steady-state electronic absorption spectra were recorded on an Agilent G1103A spectrometer. Transient absorption measurements were performed on a LP920 laser flash spectrometer in conjunction with a nanosecond tunable OPOLett 355II laser. Transient absorption spectra were measured with an Andor iStar ICCD camera (excitation wavelength: 530 nm. Detection time: 3 μs relative to the excitation pulse. Gate width of the ICCD camera: ∼500 ns). Kinetic absorption traces were detected by a fast photomultiplier tube and recorded with a TDS 3012C digital oscillograph. A CHI660C electrochemical workstation was used for square-wave voltammetric measurements of dye-coated titania films on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) with a Pt gauze counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) auxiliary electrode.
4.4. 
          Cell fabrication
A bilayer titania film was employed as the negative electrode of DSCs. On a precleaned FTO conducting glass electrode (NSG, Solar, 4 mm thick), a 2.8-μm-thick transparent layer (porosity: 0.64) consisting of 23-nm-sized titania particles was first screen-printed and further coated by a 3.3-μm-thick second layer of scattering titania particles (WER2-O, Dyesol). The film thickness was examined with a bench-top Ambios XP-1 stylus profilometer. The preparation procedures of TiO2 nanocrystals, paste for screen-printing and nanostructured TiO2 film were reported in a previous paper.36 A circular TiO2 electrode (∼0.28 cm2) was stained by immersing it into a dye solution containing 150 μM dye in a mixture of acetonitrile and tert-butanol (volume ratio: 1/1) for 5 h. After rinsing with chlorobenzene and drying by air flow, the dye-coated titania electrode was assembled with a thermally platinized FTO positive electrode possessing an electrolyte-perfusion hole, which was produced beforehand with a sand-blasting drill. The two electrodes were separated by a 30-μm-thick Bynel (DuPont) hot-melt gasket. The internal space was perfused with a liquid electrolyte with a vacuum back filling system. Ultimately, the hole on the positive electrode was closed hermetically with a Bynel sheet and a thin glass cover by heating.
4.5. Photovoltaic characterization
A Keithley 2400 source meter and a Zolix Omni-λ300 monochromator equipped with a 500 W xenon lamp were used for photocurrent action spectrum measurements, with a wavelength sampling interval of 10 nm and a current sampling time of 2 s under full computer control. A Hamamatsu S1337-1010BQ silicon diode used for IPCE measurements was calibrated at the National Institute of Metrology, China. A model LS1000-4S-AM1.5G-1000W solar simulator (Solar Light Company, USA) in combination with a metal mesh was employed to give an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity was tested with a PMA2144 pyranometer and a calibrated PMA 2100 dose control system. The J–V characteristics were obtained by applying a bias potential to a testing cell and measuring the photocurrent with a Keithley 2400 source meter under the full computer control. The measurements were fully automated using Labview 8.0. A metal mask with an aperture area of 0.158 cm2 was covered on a testing cell during all measurements. An antireflection film (λ < 380 nm, ARKTOP, ASAHI Glass) was adhered to the DSC photoanode during IPCE and J–V measurements. The short-circuit photocurrent densities measured under this solar simulator are well consistent with the integral of IPCEs over the AM1.5G spectrum (ASTM G173-03), within a 5% error.
4.6. Electrical impedance measurement
Electrical impedance measurements of DSCs under illumination of a white light-emitting diode (LED) were performed on an IM6ex electrochemical workstation. Steady-state lights at various intensities obtained by tuning the driving voltage of LED were shed on a testing cell to generate different Voc. A potential bias (V) equivalent to an open-circuit photovoltage was applied on the testing cell to meet the zero-current condition. A frequency range from 50 mHz to 100 kHz and a potential modulation of 20 mV were applied. The measured impedance spectra were fitted with the Z-view software (v2.80, Scribner Associates Inc.) in terms of a proper equivalent circuit incorporating the transmission line model29,37 adaptable to DSCs.

Broader context
The iodide/triiodide redox couple, as a so far unmatched choice in formulating efficient electrolytes of dye-sensitized solar cells, is of paramount importance in attaining the certified efficiency record of 11.2%. In pursut of further efficiency improvement however, the conventional iodine electrolytes have displayed some prominent constraints on the development of counter electrodes and especially new dyes owing to the possible presence of halogen bonding, which considerably accelerates interfacial charge recombination and thus reduces the cell photovoltage. Recent progress on outer-sphere one-electron redox shuttle have opened a new avenue for the rapid development of dye-sensitized solar cells. However, a high absorption coefficient, wide-spectral response and slow charge recombination dye are desirable for this type of cell. In this paper, we study the structure–property relationship of uniped and biped dyes in mesoscopic titania solar cells with the tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt redox shuttle, shedding light on the future rational design of more powerful push–pull dyes.
