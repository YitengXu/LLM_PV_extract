    , Accepted 19th August 2020First published on 21st August 2020AbstractWe demonstrate the one-step preparation of a self-assembled MoS2/maleic acid composite without thermal or chemical treatment, and its application as a high-performance anode for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). During the one-step synthesis, pristine MoS2 and maleic acid powder are mechanically mixed. The composite anode is found to possess a reversible capacity of up to 1007 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 after 60 cycles, which remains at 780.6 mA h g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1. The outstanding performance is attributed to the maleic acid nanoballs, whose good elasticity provides buffer space to maintain the robustness of MoS2 during charge/discharge and thus enhances the reversible capacity. The novel MoS2/maleic acid composite anode and its facile and low-cost synthesis procedure could offer bulk MoS2 a great opportunity in high-performance LIBs.
1 Introduction
Clean energies such as geothermal, wind and solar energy have attracted researchers due to the environmental pollution and exhaustion of fossil fuels.1 Concerning clean energy storage, lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are top candidates to supply rechargeable power for electric vehicles and mobile electronic devices.2–4 Nowadays, graphite is still the most common anode material for LIBs due to advantages such as low cost, abundant resources, cycling stability and lack of pollution.5 However, the reversible lithium storage mechanism of graphite is lithium ion intercalation in the carbon matrix, determining a relatively low theoretical specific capacity of 372 mA h g−1.6 Hence, high-performance and low-cost electrode materials are urgently required to enhance the power and energy density of LIBs.
Up to now, several novel anode materials have been developed, which can be divided into four categories: (1) Si, Sn, and Ge and their oxides can be alloyed with lithium.7–11 (2) Transition metal oxides (MxOy)/sulfides such as Fe3O4,12 Co3O4,13 CuO,14 NiO,15 and Fe7S816 follow the conversion reaction with lithium: MxOy + 2yLi → xM + yLi2O. Si-based and metal oxide anodes have relatively high theoretical capacity, but the cycling stability is limited by enormous volume expansion/contraction during charge/discharge.17 (3) Titanium-based anodes can insert lithium in a crystalline structure, exhibiting excellent cycle stability due to the zero-strain.18,19 (4) Compounds with carbonyl groups, organic salts and conjugated polymers were found to have reversible lithium storage capacity.20–24
Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), a transition metal chalcogenide, has a similar structure but superior theoretical capacity (∼650 mA h g−1) to graphite.25 However, the interlayer van der Waals attractions and low electronic conductivity of MoS2 hinder the electronic/ion exchange in electrodes, resulting in poor cycle life and rate performance. To enhance the electrochemical performance of MoS2, researchers have focused on adopting two effective approaches: (1) the synthesis of MoS2 nanosheets, nanospheres and nanoflowers with regular morphologies and large specific area to provide a stable environment and reduce the diffusion length of Li-ions during cycling;26–29 and (2) introducing carbon nanotubes (CNTs),30,31 graphene32,33 or graphene oxide (GO)34 as conductive matrices to mitigate the structural degradation of MoS2. Nevertheless, these routes rely on expensive and long-time solvothermal,35 hydrothermal36,37 or sonication processes.38
Herein, we report a MoS2/maleic acid composite anode through a facile one-step solvent method. After solvent evaporation, the composite structure with maleic acid nanoballs coated on MoS2 can be self-assembled. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectra, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) are utilized to characterize the composite structure. The optimal mass fraction of maleic acid is revealed via electrochemical tests. After cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, it is speculated that the synergistic lithium-ion storage mechanisms and small-volume effect contribute to the outstanding electrochemical performance of MoS2/maleic acid composite anodes. To the best of our knowledge, compared to the state-of-art progress in MoS2-based anodes for LIBs, the pristine MoS2-based composite anode and its one-step synthesis procedure in this work has a much lower cost, but a high capacity beyond 1000 mA h g−1 and excellent rate performance. Thus, this potentially scalable and cost-effective route and the MoS2/maleic acid composite anode have broad application prospects in developing low-cost and high-performance LIBs.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of composite anode
The fabrication of the MoS2/maleic acid composite anode is illustrated in Fig. 1. MoS2 (Alfa Aesar) and maleic acid bulk (Sigma Aldrich) are dispersed in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone solvent by ball milling at 400 rpm for 2 h. Afterwards, acetylene black (AB) conductive agent and poly vinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder are added into the above solution to form a homogeneous anode slurry via magnetron stirring. Electrodes with various MoS2/maleic acid ratios (1/5, 1/2, 1/1, 2/1 and 5/1) are prepared to investigate the relationship between the electrochemical performance and the maleic acid content. The above composite anodes are denoted MoS2/maleic 1:5, MoS2/maleic 1:2, MoS2/maleic 1:1, MoS2/maleic 2:1 and MoS2/maleic 5:1, respectively. Meanwhile, a pure MoS2 anode and a pure maleic acid anode are also fabricated for comparison. In consideration of the low conductivity of maleic acid, the weight ratio of active materials/AB/PVDF is set as 6/3/1. The anode slurries are coated onto a Cu foil and dried at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for 8 h to remove the solvent. The loading mass of active material in the anode is ∼1 mg cm−2.

2.2 Button assembly and electrochemical tests
All the electrodes are assembled into two-electrode CR2016 half cells in an Ar-filled glove box, using a Celgard M825 membrane separator, lithium foil as the counter electrode, and 1 M LiPF6 in a mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC)/dimethyl carbonate (DMC)/diethylene carbonate (DEC) (1:1:1 v/v) as the electrolyte. LAND CT2001A and Zennium (Germany) electrochemical workstation are used to evaluate cyclic voltmmetry (CV), galvanostatic charge–discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at room temperature. The scan rate is 0.2 mV for CV tests. The voltage window is 0.005–3 V for all anodes. The frequency range is 0.1 Hz–1 MHz at open circuit voltage for EIS tests.
2.3 Characterization
The MoS2/maleic 1:1 composite is characterized compared with MoS2 bulk and maleic acid bulk. XRD patterns are obtained by a Bruker D8-advance X-ray diracmeter. FTIR is recorded by a Bruker TENSOR 27 in a wavenumber range of 4000–400 cm−1. Raman spectroscopy is conducted using a Renishaw RM2000 instrument equipped with a 514 nm laser. XPS is performed on an ESCALA 250 using Al Kα radiation to determine elemental compositions and assignments of C1s, Mo3d, S2s and S2p peaks. SEM imaging is carried out by Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscopy.
3 Results and discussion
The XRD patterns in Fig. 2(a) confirm that MoS2/maleic acid composites have high phase purity and crystallinity. For MoS2 bulk, there are five typical diffraction peaks at 14.2°, 39.5°, 44°, 49.8° and 60.1°. For maleic acid bulk, the characteristic peaks are located at 17.4°, 22.4°, 28°, 33.2° and 58°. In the MoS2/maleic acid composites, all the diffraction peaks could be distinguished and correspond to the pure MoS2 and maleic acid bulks. As displayed in Fig. 2(b), the Raman spectra of MoS2/maleic acid composites have two strong peaks located at 379 and 404 cm−1, corresponding to E2g1 and A1g Raman active modes due to in-plane and out-of-plane vibrations, respectively.39 In addition, the Raman characteristic peaks of maleic acid are also discerned. FTIR spectra of pristine MoS2, maleic acid, and MoS2/maleic acid composite are compared in Fig. 2(c). The obvious absorption peak at 1707 cm−1 and the broad absorption in the range from 2300–3100 cm−1 can be observed in the spectra of maleic acid and the composite, which are induced by the CO stretching and O–H vibration mode of the COOH group for maleic acid, respectively.40,41 In summary, the XRD, Raman spectra and FTIR results of the MoS2/maleic acid composite reflect the characteristics of both components, indicating that there is no chemical reaction inside the molecules during the preparation process.

To further investigate the chemical bonding and element valence of the MoS2/maleic acid composite, XPS spectra of maleic acid, MoS2 and the as-prepared composite are shown in Fig. 3. For the pristine maleic acid, the C1s peak can be fitted by 5 Lorentz peaks: 284 eV for CC, 284.8 eV for C–H, 286 eV for C–O, 288.8 eV for COOH and 290 eV for impurity.42,43 For MoS2 bulk, the Mo3d3/2, Mo3d5/2, S2s, S2p3/2 and S2p1/2 have binding energies of 233, 229.9, 227.1, 163.9 and 162.7 eV, respectively. For the MoS2/maleic acid composite, the C1s peak is slightly different from that of maleic acid: an extra peak at 287.2 eV appears, corresponding to COO−,44 indicating that there is a binding force between the surfaces of maleic acid and MoS2 particles. The binding energies of Mo3d, S2s and S2p of the composite are extremely similar to those of MoS2, demonstrating the existence of Mo4+ and S2−.45 The local high temperature during ball milling may lead to the formation of inorganic carbon groups such as CO32− and π–π.

The electrochemical performance of pristine MoS2 and MoS2/maleic acid composites with different weight ratios were investigated. Fig. 4(a) shows the cycling performance of all composites with different maleic acid content at 100 mA g−1 current rate. MoS2 bulk has an initial reversible capacity of ∼824 mA h g−1. This value decays rapidly in subsequent cycles and remains ∼210.8 mA h g−1 after 60 cycles. After adding maleic acid into MoS2 to form composites, the cyclic performances of the MoS2 anodes show amazing improvement. The specific capacities of MoS2/maleic acid composite anodes show an apparently increasing trend. After 60 cycles, the charge capacity of MoS2/maleic 1:5, MoS2/maleic 1:2, MoS2/maleic 1:1, MoS2/maleic 2:1 and MoS2/maleic 5:1 are 997.2, 955.1,1007.1, 947.6 and 834.7 mA h g−1, respectively. The capacity increase phenomenon of the MoS2/maleic acid composites during long-term cycling might arise from a synergistic effect between MoS2 and maleic acid. After the 5th cycle, the coulombic efficiencies of all the composite anodes are greater than 97%. The unsatisfactory initial coulombic efficiency can be ascribed to maleic acid, which can be eliminated by prelithiation and proper compositing methodology.44,46

The rate capability of MoS2 and MoS2/maleic acid composites at various current densities from 100 mA g−1 to 2 A g−1 is displayed in Fig. 4(b). The specific capacity of MoS2 bulk decreases sharply as the current density increases, and remains only ∼40 mA h g−1 at 2 A g−1 current rate. In contrast, MoS2/maleic acid composites have outstanding rate capability. The average charge capacity is 807.9, 830.8, 824.1, 808.5 and 780.6 mA h g−1 at a charge–discharge current density of 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 mA g−1, respectively. When the current density is decreased to 100 mA g−1, MoS2/maleic 1:1 can still regain a reversible capacity of 833.8 mA h g−1. The cyclic performance and rate capability of the pure maleic acid anode are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The reversible capacity of maleic acid bulk is 608, 619, 515.9, 405.6 and 299.4 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 2000 mA g−1, respectively. Importantly, all the MoS2/maleic acid composite anodes exhibit more excellent electrochemical performance than each individual component.
Cyclic voltammogram (CV) tests can further confirm the superiority of the composite anodes. Fig. 5(a) shows the first three CV profiles of MoS2 bulk. In the initial cycle, there are two strong reduction peaks centered at 0.8 V and 0.38 V, related to the formation of LixMoS2 with octahedral structure47 and the further conversion into Li2S and metallic Mo, respectively.25,36 After the first cycle, three different anodic peaks at 1.72 V, 1.07 V and 0.29 V arise, corresponding to the reversible redox reactions: 2Li+ + S + 2e− → Li2S, MoSx + xLi+ + xe− → Li2MoS2, and LixMoS2 + (4 − x)Li+ + (4 − x)e− → Mo + 2Li2S. In anodic sweeps, the oxidation peak at 2.43 V can be attributed to Li2S → 2Li+ + S + 2e−. Fig. S2(a) (ESI†) shows the CV curves of the pure maleic acid anode. The small redox peak at 0.98 V and anodic peak at 1.58 V disappear in subsequent cycles, which may be ascribed to the formation of a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) and lithium maleate.46,48 The typical anodic peaks at 1.58 and 2.64 V indicate the de-lithiation of maleic acid. The CV curves of the MoS2/maleic acid composite (Fig. 5(d)) exhibit the redox peaks of each single component and are almost overlapped in the second and third cycles. The CV curve at the 60th cycle still has clear redox peaks, indicating the good cycle stability of the composite.

Fig. 5(b) and (e) show the charge–discharge profiles of MoS2 bulk and MoS2/maleic 1:1 at 100 mA g−1 current density. Fig. S2(b) and S3 (ESI†) show the profiles of maleic acid and other composites. The initial charge/discharge capability of MoS2 is 1030 and 755.4 mA h g−1, but rapidly degrades after the first cycle. The charge–discharge curves present severe polarization, inducing the poor cycling performance of MoS2. In comparison, MoS2/maleic 2:1 achieves the highest initial charge/discharge capacity of 1803.2 and 875.6 mA h g−1. MoS2/maleic 1:1 has the best cycling performance with a reversible capability of 1007.1 mA h g−1. All the composite electrodes have less polarization and better cycle stability than MoS2 bulk. This phenomenon indicates that maleic acid plays a critical role in maintaining the robust architecture during long-term cycling.

Fig. 5(c) and (f) compare the charge/discharge profiles of MoS2 and MoS2/maleic 1:1 at various current densities. Fig. S2(c) and S4 (ESI†) display the results for maleic acid and other composites. The curves of pristine MoS2 are seriously distorted at large current density, and cannot recover even after the current density returns to 100 mA g−1. With the addition of maleic acid, the voltage hysteresis of MoS2 is effectively overcome. The capacity retention of MoS2/maleic 1:1 is 97.3% and 93.9% when the current rate increases 10 and 20 times, respectively.
To further confirm the advantages of the MoS2/maleic acid composite anode, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of all anodes are performed after charge/discharge. The Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 6(a). The first circle in the high frequency region relates to SEI resistance (RSEI). The charge-transfer impedance (Rct) of electrodes can be fitted by the quasi-semicircle curve located in the medium-frequency region. It can be evidently observed that MoS2/maleic acid composite anodes have lower RSEI and Rct than MoS2 bulk. Lithium ion diffusion (DLi) is negatively correlated with Warburg coefficient fitted according to the slopes in Fig. 6(b). Compared with pristine MoS2, MoS2/maleic acid composites are more favorable for Li-ion diffusion.

Fig. 7 demonstrates the morphology of MoS2 and MoS2/maleic 1:1 after charge/discharge, which can reasonably explain the EIS results. Compared to the pristine anode before cycling (see Fig. S5, ESI†), MoS2 particles suffer from distinct volume expansion after charge/discharge. Moreover, thick SEI films form on the surface of MoS2 after each cycle, inducing higher SEI resistance. As for MoS2/maleic 1:1, the particle size of MoS2 is decreased to less than 5 μm after ball milling, and meanwhile the diffusion distance of Li-ions is shortened. MoS2 particles are uniformly coated by maleic acid nanoballs, whose good elasticity provides buffer space for the volume change of MoS2. Therefore, the composite materials can maintain the robust structure and stability of the SEI film after deep cycling. Furthermore, MoS2 and maleic acid provide active sites and enhance each other’s electrochemical activity. For these favorable reasons, MoS2/maleic acid composite anodes display outstanding cycling capacity and rate performance.

4 Conclusions
In summary, we have proposed a MoS2 composite anode prepared by a facile one-step method with excellent electrochemical performance. The Raman spectra, XRD, FTIR and XPS measurements confirm that chemical reactions are absent during the preparation process, but relatively strong connections are established between MoS2 and maleic acid. According to the electrochemical tests, MoS2/maleic 1:1 is the best choice to obtain optimal cycling stability and rate capability. The composite anode displays a reversible capability of 1007 mA h g−1 after 60 cycles and remains 780.6 mA h g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1, which is comparable to MoS2 synthesized by expensive chemical methods. This work explores a convenient, low-cost and expandable route to design a novel inorganic/organic composite electrode based on pristine MoS2. With the addition of a highly efficient conductive agent,49 this novel composite anode has great potential for practical applications in LIBs.
