Physicochemical measurements as well as device evaluations revealed that the characteristic properties of these materials are derived from their three-dimensional structure.
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have received considerable attention due to the general demand for clean and renewable energy resources, and their specific advantages as low production cost, large-area printable, and flexible devices.1,2 After the advent of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells that consist of a blend of electron-donating (p-type) and electron-accepting (n-type) materials,3 recent remarkable developments in donor materials based on low-bandgap conjugated polymers have promoted a significant increase in the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OPVs.4 On the other hand, progress in high-performance acceptor materials has been relatively slow, and as a result, OPVs are fabricated from a limited repertoire of fullerene derivatives consisting of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM),3 indene–C60 bisadduct (IC60BA),5 and bis(dimethylphenylsilylmethyl)[60]fullerenes (SIMEFs).6 Therefore, novel acceptor materials as alternatives to fullerene derivatives are highly desired to boost the performance and diversity of OPVs. With this pretext, n-type semiconductor materials based on linearly conjugated low molecular weight molecules and polymers have been developed as acceptor materials in OPVs.7,8 However, their PCEs are not satisfactory. To address this situation, we hypothesized a three-dimensional (3-D) arrangement of electron-accepting π-conjugated molecules9 that would form isotropic electron-transporting pathways like fullerene derivatives in the BHJ cell, facilitate the charge-separation process, and/or impede the recombination of charges.10 Based on this hypothesis, we envisioned two compounds: one with a tetragonal structure having tetraphenylmethane11 at the center, and the other with a hexahedron structure having silsesquioxane at the center;12 and alkylated perylene bis(dicarboximide) (PDI)13,14 at the corners. In this communication, we report on the synthesis, properties, and photovoltaic performances of the compounds that we envisioned (Tetra-PDI and Hexa-PDI) (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of Tetra-PDI and Hexa-PDI. 
The syntheses of the 3-D compounds Tetra-PDI and Hexa-PDI are shown in Scheme S1 in the ESI.† Both the target compounds were soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform (CHCl3) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), which allowed us to use preparative gel-permeation liquid chromatography (GPLC) for their purification, and to subsequently fabricate their thin films by a solution process.
Since the intermolecular interactions of PDI derivatives are known to affect their photophysical properties,15,16 the UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra of Tetra-PDI, Hexa-PDI, and a dialkylated PDI monomer 6, as reference, dissolved in CHCl3 at a PDI unit concentration of 10−6 M, were measured. As shown in Fig. 2(a), three vibrational transitions, typical to PDI, were observed for all the compounds, between the wavelengths 450 and 530 nm. The absorption spectra of Tetra-PDI and 6 were similar in shape and exhibited almost the same molar extinction coefficient normalized by a PDF unit (Fig. S1, ESI†), and their fluorescence spectra, as shown in Fig. 2(b) were like a mirror image of their absorption spectra. These results indicate the absence of π–π stacking type aggregation and excitonic interactions between the PDI units of Tetra-PDI.17 On the other hand, the absorption spectrum of Hexa-PDI was markedly broad and tailed around 570 nm. The fluorescence spectrum of Hexa-PDI exhibited a spectral transposition to longer wavelengths with reduced intensity, which was evident of excimer emission. The pronounced spectral changes in Hexa-PDI suggest the formation of H-type aggregates.15,16,18 The concentration-dependent UV-vis absorption spectrum of Hexa-PDI in CHCl3 exhibited only minor spectral changes, as shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI,† which excludes the influence of intermolecular π–π interactions between PDI moieties at the eponymous concentration ranges. Thus, these results indicate that the 3-D structure of Hexa-PDI facilitates intramolecular interactions between the PDI units, and the presence of a flexible propylene group between PDI and silsesquioxane in Hexa-PDI induces intramolecular H-type π–π stacking aggregation.19 In comparison to the photophysical properties in solution, the UV-vis absorption spectra of the films of Tetra-PDI, Hexa-PDI, and 6 prepared by spin-coating on a quartz plate, exhibited predominantly broadened spectra, which were similar in shape for all the samples, as shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI,† indicating that all the samples aggregated with strong π–π interactions in the solid state.20

To elucidate the influence of the 3-D structure on the electrochemical properties, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were performed for all the compounds in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as a supporting electrolyte, and the potentials were calibrated to the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) reference. In comparison to 6, which featured two reversible reduction waves, Tetra-PDI and Hexa-PDI displayed broad reduction waves, as shown in Fig. 3(a). This substantial difference in the voltammograms might be due to the concomitant inter- and intra-molecular aggregation in Tetra-PDI and Hexa-PDI, as their concentration of 10−3 M in these measurements was much higher than that employed for the photophysical measurements (10−6 M). The reduction potentials (Ered) of Tetra-PDI, Hexa-PDI, and 6 were determined from the DPV measurements, as demonstrated in Fig. 3(b). From the Ered values and the energy level of Fc/Fc+, which is −4.8 eV below the vacuum level,21 the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of Tetra-PDI, Hexa-PDI, and 6 were estimated to be −3.75, −3.82, and −3.70 eV, respectively.

To verify the potential of the 3-D compounds as acceptor materials in photovoltaics, their respective BHJ solar cells were fabricated using poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as the donor. The cells had a typical device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/P3HT:acceptor/LiF/Al. The blended active layers were fabricated by spin-coating from their o-DCB solutions followed by thermal annealing at 80 °C. The concentration of blended solutions and the donor–acceptor ratio were fixed at 1.0 wt% and 1:1, respectively. Note that the surface morphologies of the blended films obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements showed aggregated domains, indicating that distinct differences in morphologies were not observed among these films (Fig. S4, ESI†). Fig. 4 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the OPV devices under simulated solar illumination with an air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) and an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The characteristic photovoltaic parameters: Voc, short-circuit current (Jsc), fill factor (FF), and PCE are presented in Table 1.

Surprisingly, Tetra-PDI showed similar OPV characteristics to 6.22 The Hexa-PDI-based OPV exhibited the best performance with the highest Jsc and consequently the highest PCE of 0.18%. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of these devices indicate moderate photoconversion efficiencies in the visible region (400–700 nm). The Hexa-PDI-based device had the highest EQE values. To investigate the origin of the differences in the PCEs, the electron-transport properties and surface energies of these compounds were investigated by organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and contact angle measurements, respectively. As shown in Fig. S5 and Table S1 (ESI†), Tetra-PDI and Hexa-PDI showed n-type responses with moderate electron mobilities, despite their bulky 3-D structures, which are comparable to that of 6. It has been reported that surface energy (γ) affects the formation of various film morphologies in bulk heterojunction OPVs.23 It appears that Hexa-PDI (20.0 mJ m−2) had a larger γ value than Tetra-PDI (17.0 mJ m−2) and 6 (14.7 mJ m−2). Under the same conditions, the γ values of typical OPV materials like P3HT and PC61BM are 9.7 and 33.7 mJ m−2, respectively. These results imply that a larger difference in surface energy between the Hexa-PDI acceptor and the P3HT donor might have promoted the formation of desirable nanometer-scale domains. Therefore, Hexa-PDI has relatively the highest electron mobility and surface free energy, which delivers the best OPV performance. On the other hand, the values of the Voc obtained in this study were much lower than those expected from the difference in energy levels and those of typical solar cells. In order to examine the origin, the dependence of the Voc and the recombination lifetime on the charge densities of cells employing Hexa-PDI and PC61BM were measured (Fig. 5). The values of Voc, Jsc, and FF for the P3HT/PC61BM cell were 0.61 V, 8.1 mA cm−2, and 0.48, respectively. Fig. 5(a) shows that at the matched charge density, the value of Voc for the P3HT/PC61BM cell was higher than that for the P3HT/Hexa-PDI cell, implying that the energy difference between the donor HOMO level and the acceptor LUMO level of the P3HT/Hexa-PDI cell was smaller than that for the P3HT/PC61BM cell. However, from CV measurements, the LUMO level of PCBM (−3.69 eV) was found to be similar to that of Hexa-PDI. Thus, a thin dipole layer may be formed at the Hexa-PDI/P3HT interface, decreasing the difference between the energy levels of the two materials. Fig. 5(b) shows that the P3HT/Hexa-PDI cell had a longer lifetime, but it could not compensate for the low Voc. The longer lifetime can be rationalized by two factors: one is the lower energy difference, that is, lower driving force for charge recombination; and the other is the lower charge mobility in the P3HT/Hexa-PDI cell. This was suggested from the results of the transient current measurement (data not shown), which showed that the charge carriers took a much longer time to decay in the P3HT/Hexa-PDI cell than in the P3HT/PC61BM cell when the light was turned off. The slow mobility could also be a cause for the low Jsc.

In summary, 3-D electron-accepting compounds containing PDI units were successfully synthesized and their physical properties, as well as photovoltaic performance in OPV devices were evaluated. These compounds exhibited distinct electronic and electrochemical properties, which originate from their 3-D structures. The OPV devices based on the 3-D compounds blended with P3HT showed equal or higher PCEs as compared to an OPV of a planar PDI derivative blended with P3HT. Our preliminary results highlight the importance of molecular design for acceptor materials in OPV applications, and imply that with an appropriate n-type π-conjugated system having both high electron mobility and surface free energy, high-performance OPV devices can be fabricated without using fullerene-based materials. In addition, an appropriate dipole layer at the donor and acceptor interface needs to be designed in order to maximize the open-circuit voltage.
