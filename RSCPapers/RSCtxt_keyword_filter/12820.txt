    , Accepted 11th September 2020First published on 16th September 2020AbstractThe thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) unit is a classic building block to construct high-performance fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs) for organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, a star-shaped FREA BTTCTT-ICF based on a new C3h-symmetric fused-ring core BTTCTT was designed and synthesized by introducing the TT unit to extend the π-conjugation. Due to its strong electron-donating ability and efficient π-electron delocalization, BTTCTT-ICF exhibited a narrow optical bandgap of 1.54 eV and a high absorption extinction coefficient of 3.6 × 105 M−1 cm−1. The blend film of BTTCTT-ICF and the wide bandgap polymer PM6 produced a complementary absorption and a broad EQE spectral range covering 300 to 850 nm. When treated via thermal annealing, the PM6:BTTCTT-ICF blend film exhibited more ordered molecular packing and a suitable phase morphology, which improved its charge mobility and device efficiency. Consequently, the PM6:BTTCTT-ICF-based inverted device achieved the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.39% with a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 16.77 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.91 V and fill factor (FF) of 68.08%. Our results demonstrate that the extension of the star-shaped fused-ring core by TT units is a rational and effective strategy for achieving highly efficient star-shaped FREAs.
Introduction
Non-fullerene acceptors have been widely used in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) because of their advantages such as adjustable energy levels, strong light absorption in the visible and near-infrared region and suitable miscibility with donors as compared with fullerene and its derivatives.1–3 Since Zhan and co-workers developed the milestone fused-ring electron acceptor (FREA) ITIC in 2015,4 the significant research on FREAs has further accelerated the development of OSCs and boosted the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of single-junction OSCs to over 16%.5–11 The majority of FREAs commonly feature an acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) linear structure, which is beneficial to modulate the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and π-conjugation. In terms of geometry, star-shaped FREAs are another type of FREAs, which consist of a star-shaped fused-ring core and multiple electron-withdrawing end groups on its periphery. This star-shaped D–A framework produces strong ICT absorption and π-electron delocalization in extended dimensions.12,13 Star-shaped FREAs with a coplanar π-conjugated backbone also facilitate 3D molecular packing and electron transport, leading to higher electron mobility than their linear analogues.14 However, compared to the diversity of linear FREAs, star-shaped FREAs are scarce due to rare accessibility towards star-shaped fused-ring cores and challenging core engineering.
Truxene is a polycyclic aromatic molecule with a symmetric and rigid coplanar structure. Star-shaped FREAs based on a truxene core display high absorbance, highly delocalized π-electrons and effective charge transport. However, these truxene-based acceptors possess relatively wide bandgaps due to the weak electron-donating capability of truxene, as reported by Duan's group15 and Peng's group.16,17 Inspired by the C2h-symmetric conjugated backbones of linear FREAs, we firstly developed C3h-symmetric planar trindeno[1,2-b:4,5-b′:7,8-b′′]trithiophene (TITT) and benzotri(cyclopentadithiophene) (BTCDT) to construct a series of star-shaped FREAs in recent works.18,19 The introduction of multiple thiophene rings into the planar fused-ring skeletons leads to remarkably enhanced electron-donating ability, and thus the resulting acceptors achieve stronger and red-shifted ICT absorption relative to the truxene-based acceptors. Among them, BTCDT-ICF composed of a BTCDT core and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2FIC) end groups present the lowest bandgap of 1.62 eV, and thus a broadened spectral response region when blended with the wide bandgap polymer J61. Around the same time, Zhan and co-workers reported the acceptor FBTIC, which has the same chemical structure as BTCDT-ICF, achieving a significantly improved PCE of 10.1% with a simultaneously increased open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) upon pairing with the polymer donor PM6 in the optimized inverted device.14 However, to date, the performance of star-shaped FREAs lags far behind their linear counterparts. The unsatisfactory photovoltaic performance of the star-shaped FREAs is primarily ascribed to their large bandgap of over 1.6 eV, which to a certain extent restricts their solar energy utilization and the short-circuit current density (Jsc). Therefore, the design and synthesis of new star-shaped FREAs with a narrower bandgap are expected to further enhance the device efficiencies.
Extensive works have confirmed that extending the π-conjugation of the fused-ring core plays a crucial role in developing high-performance FREAs.20,21 Thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) is an electron-rich and rigid fragment, which has been widely utilized in linear FREAs to extend their effective conjugation length and improve their coplanarity simultaneously.22–24 Owing to its stronger electron-donating ability and more efficient electron delocalization, TT can bathochromically shift the absorption and reduce the optical bandgap more efficiently than the thiophene ring in ladder-type fused-ring frameworks. Especially, plenty of efficient narrow-bandgap FREAs, e.g., IHIC,254TIC,26F8IC,27COi8DFIC28 and Y6,29 are comprised of an electron-rich polycyclic core containing TT units. Besides, the more easily polarized sulfur atoms in TT may be prone to forming intermolecular S⋯S interactions, which facilitate π-stacking and charge transport.30 Nevertheless, to date star-shaped FREAs with the fusion of TT units have never been explored. In this work, we conducted further extension of the star-shaped fused-ring core by fastening TTs to the benzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′:5,6-b′′]trithiophene central unit via cyclopentadienyl rings to create a new C3h-symmetric fused-ring core, namely BTTCTT. In contrast to TITT and BTCDT, the tetracyclic arms of BTTCTT are more stretched from the central benzene ring in two-dimensional directions, which is more favorable for π-electron delocalization along its conjugated backbone. According to DFT calculations, BTTCTT has the lowest bandgap with an upshifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level among the three cores, and thus the further lowered bandgap of the BTTCTT-based star-shaped FREA could be predicted (Scheme 1a). By symmetrically integrating three electron-deficient 2FIC with BTTCTT, the new star-shaped acceptor molecule BTTCTT-ICF exhibited a narrower optical bandgap of 1.54 eV and a higher absorption extinction coefficient of 3.6 × 105 M−1 cm−1 than that of TITT- and BTCDT-based FREAs (Scheme 1b). When the wide bandgap polymer PM6 was selected as the donor,31 the complementary absorption allowed the PM6:BTTCTT-ICF-based device to produce a wide spectral response range from 300 to 850 nm, which facilitated an enhancement in the photocurrent. By employing the inverted structure and thermal annealing treatment for optimization, the PM6:BTTCTT-ICF-based device delivered the highest PCE of 10.39% with a Jsc of 16.77 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.91 V, and FF of 68.08%.

Results and discussion
The synthetic route for BTTCTT-ICF is illustrated in Scheme 2. Firstly, the key intermediate methyl 2-bromothieno[3,2-b]thiophene-3-carboxylate (compound 4) was prepared starting from 3-bromothieno[3,2-b]thiophene (compound 1) according to modified methods.32 Then the Suzuki coupling reaction of 2,5,8-trimethylstannyl benzo-[1,2-b:3,4-b′:5,6-b′′]trithiophene (compound 5) and compound 4 in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst afforded compound 6. Owing to its poor solubility, compound 6 was used directly in the next step without further purification. The treatment of compound 6 with an excess amount of (4-hexylphenyl)-magnesium bromide yielded compound 7 with triol, which became soluble and then underwent intramolecular triple Friedel–Crafts-type cyclization to furnish the core BTTCTT. The total yield of the three steps was 15%. After introducing three aldehyde groups into BTTCTT through the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction, BTTCTT-CHO was produced in a yield of 76%, which was then reacted with 2FIC via a Knoevenagel condensation reaction to afford the target product BTTCTT-ICF in the yield of 58%. All the compounds were characterized via1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectroscopy. BTTCTT-ICF showed good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene, at room temperature. The thermal properties of BTTCTT-ICF were investigated via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere. BTTCTT-ICF exhibited thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss) of 320 °C, meeting the requirement of device fabrication.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of BTTCTT-ICF were recorded in dilute chloroform solution (5 × 10−6 M) and in thin film prepared by spin-coating its chloroform solution (Fig. 1a). In chloroform solution, BTTCTT-ICF exhibited a strong absorption with a high molar maximum extinction coefficient of 3.6 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 683 nm. In thin film, BTTCTT-ICF showed a broadened absorption in the region of 550 to 800 nm and a red-shifted absorption peak at 711 nm, which was also more red-shifted relative to that of the TITT- and BTCDT-based acceptors (blew 700 nm). The absorption peak of the BTTCTT-ICF thin film was further red-shifts to 726 nm after thermal annealing at 200 °C (Fig. S2, ESI†), which can be attributed to the ordered and dense molecular packing occurring during thermal annealing.33 Based on the absorption edge of 805 nm, the optical bandgap of BTTCTT-ICF was estimated to be 1.54 eV. Compared with TITT-ICF and BTCDT-ICF, the higher molar extinction coefficient and narrower optical bandgap of BTTCTT-ICF is attributed to its larger conjugation length and stronger ICT effect owing to the introduction of TT units. BTTCTT-ICF and the wide bandgap polymer donor PM6 are mutually complementary in absorption spectra, which is beneficial for solar energy utilization and the promotion of Jsc in OSCs.

The energy levels of the BTTCTT-ICF thin film were investigated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement (Fig. S4, ESI†). The HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels were estimated from the onset potentials of oxidation and reduction in the CV curve, and the measurement was referenced by the energy level of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+). Consequently, the obtained HOMO and LUMO levels of BTTCTT-ICF were −5.64 eV and −4.08 eV, respectively, matching well with that for the polymer donor PM6, whose HOMO and LUMO levels are located at −5.45 eV and −3.65 eV, which is beneficial for the exciton dissociation process (Fig. 1b). The optimal molecular geometry and the frontier molecular orbitals of BTTCTT-ICF were simulated by density functional theory (DFT) calculation with Gaussian 09 at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. To simplify the calculation, all the hexyls in the hexylphenyl groups were replaced with methyl. As illustrated in Fig. 2, BTTCTT-ICF featured a nearly planar molecular backbone with bulky side chains on its top and bottom sides. The DFT calculation revealed that the HOMO and HOMO−1, LUMO and LUMO+1 of BTTCTT-ICF are degenerate. Hence, the HOMO level is mainly concentrated on the central BTTCTT core and extended to the dicyano-vinyl moieties of the 2FIC groups, while the LUMO level is delocalized along the whole backbone and the entire 2FIC group. The HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated to be −5.60 eV and −3.40 eV, which are fairly close to the experimental data measured by the CV method.

To investigate the photovoltaic properties of BTTCTT-ICF, we firstly fabricated OSC devices with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:BTTCTT-ICF/PDINO/Al. After the optimization of the device, including the solvent, donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio and thermal annealing (Tables S2–S4, ESI†), it was found that the optimal device performance was obtained with a D/A ratio of 1:1.5 from chloroform solution under thermal annealing at 200 °C for 10 min. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the as-cast and optimized devices are shown in Fig. S5a (ESI†) and the corresponding performance parameters are summarized in Table S5 (ESI†). Upon thermal annealing treatment, the device exhibited a higher Jsc and FF but slightly lower Voc than the as-cast device. Thus, the optimal conventional device afforded a better PCE of 7.98% with a Voc of 0.89 V, Jsc of 15.41 mA cm−2 and FF of 58.64%. To further improve the device performance and long-term ambient stability, inverted devices were fabricated with the structure of ITO/ZnO/PM6:BTTCTT-ICF/MoO3/Ag. As shown in Fig. 3a and Table 1, compared with conventional devices, the inverted device without thermal annealing exhibited an elevated Jsc of 15.65 mA cm−2 and FF of 63.53%, leading to a higher PCE of 9.25%, which may originate from the more effective charge transportation and extraction at the correct electrode affected by vertical phase separation and the enhanced optical absorption caused by the redistribution of the electric field intensity of the incident photons inside the active layer in the inverted device.34,35 Notably, after thermal annealing, the PCE further increased to 10.39% with the best Jsc of 16.77 mA cm−2 and FF of 68.08%, which demonstrates that BTTCTT-ICF is among the most efficient star-shaped FREAs reported to date (Table S7, ESI†). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the as-cast and optimized devices are shown in Fig. 3b and Fig. S5b (ESI†). The EQE spectra of both the conventional and inverted devices based on PM6:BTTCTT-ICF covered the range of 300 to 850 nm, indicating that PM6 and BTTCTT-ICF make a complementary contribution to the overall photocurrent response. In the wavelength range of 450 to 750 nm, the EQE values of the inverted devices were much higher than that with the conventional device and the maximum EQE values increased from 57% to 67%, which is responsible for the higher Jsc of the inverted devices. However, regardless of the device structure, the thermally annealed devices exhibited a broader photoresponse in the near infrared region and around 5% increment in the region of 650–750 nm compared with the as-cast devices, indicating the narrow-bandgap acceptor moieties makes a greater contribution to the enhancement of the photocurrent. The extended EQE spectra also agree with the red-shifted absorptions of BTTCTT-ICF in the thermally annealed neat film and blend film (Fig. S2 and S3, respectively, ESI†). To investigate the thermal stability of the PM6:BTTCTT-ICF-based devices, we tested the photovoltaic performances of the devices by thermally annealing the active layer at 200 °C for different times, as shown in Fig. S6 and Table S8 (ESI†). When the active layers were annealed at 200 °C for 1 h, the corresponding device exhibited a PCE of 9.29%, approaching 90% of the initial PCE. After thermal annealing for 12 h, the device still maintained near 80% of its initial efficiency. Thus, these results demonstrate that star-shaped FREA BTTCTT-ICF is favorable for achieving thermally stable OSCs.36,37

The charge mobilities of the PM6:BTTCTT-ICF blend films were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S6, ESI†), and the structures of the hole-only and electron-only devices were ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:BTTCTT-ICF/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/PM6:BTTCTT-ICF/Ca/Al, respectively. After thermal annealing, the obtained hole (μh) and electron mobility (μe) of the blend film were 2.80 × 10−4 and 1.59 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which were higher than that of the as-cast blend film (μh = 1.90 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 3.57 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1), respectively. The unbalanced charge mobilities and the low electron mobilities of both blend films were still observed, which may result in some degree of bimolecular recombination in the devices.36 Anyway, the improved hole and electron mobilities in the thermally annealed blend film contribute to enhancing the Jsc and FF.
To study the charge recombination behavior, the dependence of Jsc and Voc on the light intensity (Plight) in the devices with an inverted structure was determined. Generally, the relationship between Jsc and Plight can be expressed as Jsc ∝ Pαlight,38 where an α value close to 1 indicates negligible bimolecular recombination. As shown in Fig. S7a (ESI†), the fitted α values are 0.913 for the as-cast device and 0.914 for the optimized device, respectively, suggesting bimolecular recombination exists in both devices to some extent. The dependence of Voc on the Plight is plotted in Fig. S7b (ESI†), and the extracted slopes are 1.18kT/q for the as-cast device and 1.16kT/q for the optimized device, implying trap-assisted recombination can be neglected and bimolecular recombination is dominant in the devices.39 We also measured the relationship between the photocurrent density (Jph) and the efficient applied voltage (Veff) to investigate the charge generation and extraction properties (Fig. S7c, ESI†). The charge dissociation probability (PE,T) could be estimated by calculating the Jph/Jsat ratio from the curve of Jph and Veff. Under short circuit condition, the corresponding Jph/Jsat values were determined to be 89% for the as-cast device and 91% for the optimized device. The slightly higher Jph/Jsat ratio in the thermally annealed device indicates more efficient excition dissociation and charge collection, which contributes to the improved Jsc and FF.
To gain more insight into the charge transfer and generation process, we tested the photoluminescence (PL) quenching efficiencies of the PM6:BTTCTT-ICF blend films before and after thermal annealing (Fig. 4). Relative to the PL emission of PM6 in the neat film, both blend films showed a significant PL quenching efficiency of greater than 98%, which implies the efficient electron transfer from PM6 to BTTCTT-ICF. In contrast, the PL peaks of BTTCTT-ICF at ∼795 nm in the blend films exhibited relatively low quenching efficiencies (∼70%) possibly due to the smaller HOMO energy offset between PM6 and BTTCTT-ICF.40 However, the thermally annealed blend film still exhibited a higher PL quenching efficiency, indicating thermal annealing induced the excitons generated on BTTCTT-ICF to undergo more efficient hole transfer. The higher quenching efficiency may afford a higher Jsc and FF, which is helpful to promote the PCE.

The morphologies of the PM6:BTTCTT-ICF blend films before and after thermal annealing were recorded via atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As shown in Fig. 5a and b, both blend films have a smooth and uniform surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.46 nm and 1.78 nm, respectively. According to the TEM images, more obvious phase separation is observed in the thermally annealed film (Fig. 5c and d), possibly due to the increased crystallinity, which is in accordance with the slightly increased surface roughness. The more suitable phase separation morphology of the thermally annealed blend film is favorable for exciton dissociation, charge generation and transport. The molecular packing of the PM6 and BTTCTT-ICF neat films and PM6:BTTCTT-ICF blend films were probed by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD). As can be seen in Fig. 6, the PM6 and BTTCTT-ICF neat films contained both face-on and edge-on orientations. PM6 exhibits an obvious (100) diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.60° and a broad (010) diffraction peak at 2θ = 23.8°, corresponding to the lamellar stacking (d = 19.2 Å) and π–π stacking (d = 3.74 Å) region, respectively. The (100) diffraction peak and (010) diffraction peak of the BTTCTT-ICF neat film are located at 2θ = 7.5° and 2θ = 25.8°, respectively, showing relatively strong lamellar stacking (d = 11.8 Å) and closed π–π stacking (d = 3.45 Å). In the blend films, the small angle diffraction peak at 2θ = 4.60° in the in-plane and out-of-plane patterns is attributed to the diffraction of PM6, while the broad diffraction peak at 2θ = ∼25.0° combines the π–π stacking diffraction features of PM6 and BTTCTT-ICF. Compared to the as-cast blend film, the thermally annealed blend film shows stronger diffraction peaks in both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, implying that the thermal annealing process results in enhanced crystallinity and more ordered molecule packing, which induces an obvious phase separation morphology, leading to improved charge mobility, and thus the better photovoltaic performance.

Conclusions
In summary, using thieno[3,2-b]thiophene to extend the π-conjugation of the star-shaped fused-ring core, we designed and synthesized a new C3h-symmetric polycyclic aromatic unit BTTCTT to construct a star-shaped FREA, BTTCTT-ICF. Benefitting from its long effective conjugated length and strong ICT effect, BTTCTT-ICF showed a broad and strong absorption with a narrow bandgap of 1.54 eV. In combination with PM6 as the polymer donor, a broad photocurrent response range from 300 to 850 nm was achieved for the BTTCTT-ICF-based OSC device. Compared with the conventional devices, the inverted devices exhibited an increased Jsc and FF, leading to higher PCEs. Under the optimized condition of thermal annealing at 200 °C, the devices exhibited more ordered molecular packing and a more suitable phase morphology than the as-cast device, which contributed to higher charge mobilities and further enhanced the device efficiencies. Therefore, the PM6:BTTCTT-ICF-based device showed an optimal PCE of 10.39% with a Voc of 0.91 V, Jsc of 16.77 mA cm−2 and FF of 68.08%. The PM6:BTTCTT-ICF-based devices could also tolerate high temperature during thermal annealing treatment, where 80% of their initial efficiency was maintained upon annealing at 200 °C for 12 h. These results indicate that BTTCTT-ICF is a promising star-shaped FREA for highly efficient and stable OSCs.

Measurement and characterization

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV-500 spectrometer at room temperature. MALDI-TOF mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Daltonics Flex Analysis. GC-MS was conducted on an Agilent 5975 to give the molecular weight of samples with the corresponding purity. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TA-TGA55 under nitrogen flow at the heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The temperature of degradation (Td) corresponds to 5% weight loss. UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured on a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV-vis spectrometer and a FluoroMax+ spectrofluorometer, respectively. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed using a CHI660a electrochemical workstation with a glassy carbon as the working electrode, a platinum gauze as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. Tetra-n-butylammonium perchlorate (n-Bu4NClO4) in acetonitrile solution (0.1 mol L−1) was used as the supporting electrolyte, and the scan rate was 50 mV s−1. The potentials were referenced using ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as the external standard. The thickness of the blend layers was measured using a KLA-Tencor profiler P7. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were measured with an SPI 3800N Probe Station in tapping mode. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a JEM-1400 (JEOL Ltd, Japan) at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV. The molecular packing was investigated via grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD), with an incident angle of 0.2° and a scanning interval of 2θ from 2° to 30°. The out-of-plane pattern and in-plane pattern were obtained on a Bruker D8 Discover thin-film diffractometer and a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) at a generator voltage of 40 kV and current of 40 mA, respectively. The XRD thin film samples were spin-coated onto silicon substrates. DFT calculations were conducted using the Gaussian 09 software package. The optimized molecular geometries and frontier molecular orbitals were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level.
Fabrication and measurement of OSC devices
The conventional devices and the inverted devices were fabricated with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:BTTCTT-ICF/PDINO/Al and ITO/ZnO/PM6:BTTCTT-ICF/MoO3/Ag, respectively. The ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned using isopropyl alcohol, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath sequentially, followed by drying in an oven at 125 °C for 30 min, and then treated with ultraviolet-ozone for 25 min. For the devices with the conventional structure, the PEDOT:PSS layer was spin-coated onto the ITO surface at 5000 rpm for 40 s. After drying in an oven at 120 °C for 30 min, all the substrates were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glovebox. The active layer was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer from the solution (PM6:BTTCTT-ICF = 1:1.5, 12 mg mL−1 in total) in chloroform at 2500 rpm for 60 s and then treated via thermal annealing at 200 °C for 10 min. Afterwards, PDINO was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s from methanol solution (1 mg mL−1) on the active layer. Finally, a 100 nm Al layer was deposited on the PDINO layer by thermal evaporation under high vacuum (<2.0 × 10−4 Pa) in a vacuum chamber. For the devices with an inverted structure, the ZnO layer was spin-coated onto the ITO surface at 5000 rpm for 60 s from the ZnO precursor (0.5 g of zinc acetate dehydrate and 0.14 g of ethanolamine were dissolved in 5 mL 2-methoxyethanol and then stirred at room temperature for 12 h), and then thermally annealed at 200 °C for 60 min. The process conditions to obtain the active layer were the same as that in the conventional devices. Finally, a layer of MoO3 (15 nm) and Ag (100 nm) electrode were sequentially deposited on the active layer by thermal evaporation under high vacuum (<1.0 × 10−4 Pa) in a vacuum chamber. The active area of the devices was 8 mm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices were measured on a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter. An XES-40S2-CE class solar simulator (Japan, SAN-EI Electric Co., Ltd) was used to provide 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G simulated solar light illumination. External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were obtained using a solar cell spectral response measurement system QE-R3011 (Enlitech Co., Ltd), which was calibrated by a certified standard monocrystalline silicon solar cell before use.
Mobilities measurement
Hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated with the structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PM6:BTTCTT-ICF/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/PM6:BTTCTT-ICF/Ca/Al, respectively. The J–V curves were measured in the dark and the mobilities were determined by fitting the dark current using the modified Mott–Gurney formula: J = 9εrε0μV2exp(0.89β(V/L)0.5)/8L3, where J is the current density, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.85 × 10−12 F m−1), μ is the charge mobility, V is the effective voltage (V = Vappl − Vbi, Vappl is the applied voltage to the device and Vbi is the built-in voltage due to the relative work function difference of the two electrodes), L is the film thickness of the active layer, and β is the field-activation factor.
