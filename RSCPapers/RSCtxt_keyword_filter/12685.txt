    , Accepted 8th February 2021First published on 9th February 2021AbstractFlow batteries (FBs) currently are one of the most promising large-scale energy storage technologies for energy grids with a large share of renewable electricity generation. Among the main technological challenges for the economic operation of a large-scale battery technology is its calendar lifetime, which ideally has to cover a few decades without significant loss of performance. This requirement can only be met if the key parameters representing the performance losses of the system are continuously monitored and optimized during the operation. Nearly all performance parameters of a FB are related to the two electrolytes as the electrochemical storage media and we therefore focus on them in this review. We first survey the literature on the available characterization methods for the key FB electrolyte parameters. Based on these, we comprehensively review the currently available approaches for assessing the most important electrolyte state variables: the state-of-charge (SOC) and the state-of-health (SOH). We furthermore discuss how monitoring and operation strategies are commonly implemented as online tools to optimize the electrolyte performance and recover lost battery capacity as well as how their automation is realized via battery management systems (BMSs). Our key findings on the current state of this research field are finally highlighted and the potential for further progress is identified.

1. Introduction
The world's demand for electricity has been continuously growing since the 1950s and is expected to grow further in the coming decades.16,17 Simultaneously, driven by an increasing environmental awareness and economic profitability, the extensive incorporation of renewable energy resources into the energy grid has moved into focus.16 In particular, large numbers of wind and solar power plants were installed into electricity grids in the recent years. However, the intermittent nature of their electricity generation calls for suitable storage technologies to handle supply and demand. Here, flow batteries (FBs) represent a highly promising solution, as they are suited for a variety of grid-supporting operations in, e.g., load levelling and peak shaving applications.18,19 The costs for battery storage installations have fallen in the recent years and are predicted to further decline in the present decade. Flow batteries are among the most competitive storage devices due to their low levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), which is projected to meet the targets for a (nearly) carbon-free energy generation.21 FBs are easily scalable and therefore ideally suited for stationary applications enabling large-scale energy storage as evidenced by a 800 MWh system currently built by Rongke Power in Dalian, China.22 In contrast to the conventional battery technologies, the storage medium in FBs is a liquid which is continuously pumped through an electrochemical reactor – the flow cell (Fig. 1).

This approach offers improved heat transfer characteristics as well as an independent scalability of both power capabilities (stack size) and battery capacity (electrolyte volume). However, FBs have large initial investment costs and, in particular, the costs for some metal-based systems such as the vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) are strongly coupled to the respective commodity prices, which currently impedes a broader commercialization.23 Several alternative material bases that do not show these dependencies are, therefore, being investigated. These systems rely on abundant elements such as, e.g., zinc, iron, sulphur, or organic molecules as well as polymers. Other important cost factors include the energy efficiency (around 85%24) and capacity utilization of the flow battery electrolytes as well as the electrolyte lifetime. These factors are mainly limited by chemical side-reactions or other physicochemical loss mechanisms occurring under specific operating conditions. As a consequence, they depend on the specific battery chemistry and strongly define the safety and efficiency limits of the battery. Therefore, a so-called battery management system (BMS) is an integral part of nearly any battery technology. Without a reliable BMS, the battery lifetime as well as its performance may be significantly reduced and risks of a complete system failure are increased. An interesting example demonstrating the possible impact of insufficient monitoring of a VRFB has recently been reported by Reynard and co-workers:25 during three years of operation, a gradually increasing imbalance between positive and negative electrolytes had gone unnoticed and caused the system to lose significant amounts of capacity. The subsequent effects of carbon corrosion at the bipolar plates exposed the copper-based current collectors to the positive electrolyte. As a consequence, a severe copper contamination was observed which – in combination with the developed imbalance – eventually led to a complete system failure.
Due to the widespread deployment of lithium-ion and lead–acid batteries in both stationary and mobile applications, failure mechanisms and side reactions as well as monitoring and mitigation strategies have been investigated in-depth for these storage technologies.26–33 Both battery types are constantly monitored by a BMS in terms of at least their voltage, current, and temperature. The monitoring of additional parameters largely depends on the intended application of the battery. While a lead-acid vehicle starter battery may not be monitored in terms of its state-of-charge (SOC) and temperature, the measurement of these parameters is crucially important for operating a lithium-ion battery (e.g., in smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles). In this context, other specific characteristics such as, e.g., the state-of-health (SOH), cycle number, capacity, power, lifetime, electrolyte levels, and remaining operation time can be measured in order to provide a comprehensive overview of the general battery state.33–35 Each of these parameters requires specific sensors and/or additional computing power adding complexity and costs to the battery system. The number of monitored parameters and the sampling interval, therefore, depend on the risks and the predicted impact of a system downtime for the customer which might originate from not monitoring a specific parameter. In the aforementioned battery technologies, the cells are usually monitored individually or in small clusters of several cells.36
Flow battery systems, however, differ with regard to their basic requirements and opportunities in parameter monitoring from these conventional battery technologies. The unique separation of electrochemical reactor and storage medium enables a greater freedom for sensor design and implementation in terms of physical dimensions, placement, and measurement methods. Even ex situ approaches for the determination of important parameters are possible, as the electrolytes can be taken out of the storage tank.37 In this context, electrolyte-related parameters are of utmost importance, since they represent the condition of the energy storage medium. Important variables like, e.g., the temperature, SOH, and SOC can be directly assessed for the individual electrolytes in both half-cells without the need of changing the reactor design. This enables fundamentally new approaches for battery monitoring as well as for obtaining an in-depth understanding of the performance-limiting processes. Despite the importance of individual electrolyte monitoring and although flow battery literature has been frequently reviewed from chemical,38–40 technological,3,37,41–43 and economic23,43,44 view points in the past two decades, there has been – to the best of our knowledge – no distinct review on electrolyte characterization and monitoring approaches so far. With the article at hand, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the important figures of merit for FB electrolyte characterization and monitoring, to present the state-of-the-art tools that are used for this purpose, and to outline how these can be used to reliably characterize and operate a FB system.
With regard to this, Section 2 introduces the fundamental aspects of FBs by briefly covering the most important components, classifications, and underlying redox chemistries. In addition to that, it contains a definition and discussion of the relevant battery and electrolyte parameters as well as their complex interconnections. Section 3 provides an overview of characterization methods for the determination of specific electrolyte parameters. In Section 4, we review approaches reported for the electrolyte state assessment and discuss their benefit for the monitoring of FBs. Finally, Section 5 covers operation strategies, capacity regeneration approaches, and general information on battery management systems. All symbols and abbreviations used throughout this article are listed in Tables 7 and 8, respectively at the end of the article.
2. Flow battery fundamentals
2.1. Overview of components
In general, the components of a flow battery can be categorized in the following subsystems (Fig. 1):3
• Electrolyte flow and storage system.
• Energy conversion system.
• Battery management system.
The electrolyte flow and storage system consists of tanks for the storage of the main electrolyte volumes, pumps, tubes, taps, connections, valves, and other components responsible for the electrolyte flow control and maintenance. An example of such systems can be observed in a recent investigation of a 9 kW vanadium flow battery.45 Various flow battery models include hydraulic calculations to evaluate effects of pumping losses on the battery round trip efficiency.46–48
The energy conversion system comprises the electrochemical reactor and its components. While different reactor geometries such as tubular, trapezoidal, circular, and rectangular (aspect-ratio) cells exist,49–55 the conventional flow batteries have so-called rectangular filter-press reactors, which basically are sandwich-type stacks of identical modules (i.e., the flow cells). The flow cells usually consist of current collectors, bipolar plates, flow frames/distributors, porous electrodes, and membranes (Fig. 2).3 Cell stacks are pressed together using end plates and bolts; therefore, all components need to be mechanically robust and durable in order to sustain the pressure required to keep the reactor liquid-tight. Current collectors are important to provide an electrical connection between a battery and an electrical source or load. They are made of highly conductive metals (usually copper) in order to provide uniform potential distribution across the electrical contact. However, the contact of metals with an electrolyte can cause corrosion and, consequently, decrease the battery performance and contaminate the electrolyte.25 Therefore, this direct contact is commonly prevented by the utilization of non-metal bipolar plates.25 These bipolar plates (BPs) provide electrical connection between the current collectors and the battery electrolyte. They need to be chemically inert with regard to the electrolyte and should be highly conductive. Graphite-based bipolar plates are commonly used; in particular, graphite–polymer composites exhibit a high mechanical strength and high conductivity.56
 Fig. 2  Schematic representation of (a) a flow cell stack and its components and (b) a cell stack.3 (Copyright©2017, Elsevier Ltd.) 
Various approaches are investigated for the improvement of graphite composite BPs such as, e.g., novel production methods,56 post-production modifications,57 novel binder types,58,59 conductive filler carbon materials,59,60 adjustment of the binder-filler ratio,56 and corrosion measurement methods.61 Flow frames or distributors direct the electrolyte flow within the flow cell. Among the materials used for flow frame production are, e.g., PP and PVC, owing to their relatively high chemical resistance towards corrosive electrolytes and their low production costs.62 Such distributors can be combined with so-called flow field profiles, machined into the bipolar plates to achieve essentially two different cell designs: flow-through and flow-by configurations.50,63–65 The major interface for the electrochemical reaction is provided by the porous electrodes. They possess high specific surface areas and are chemically inert, conductive, and enable fast reaction kinetics. Mostly, porous graphite materials such as graphite paper or carbon felts are used.66,67 The research on porous electrodes is currently focused on the investigation of microstructural effects, approaches for surface modifications,42,56,66,68,69 development of production technologies, and the economical assessment.56
The last major component of the flow cell is its membrane. While it prevents the mixing of both electrolytes, it has to facilitate the exchange of inactive (supporting electrolyte) ions to maintain the charge balance between the battery half-cells. Consequently, membrane materials should be chemically stable in the electrolytes and have both a high ionic conductivity as well as selectivity to prevent cross-contamination by the redox species. Depending on the type of flow battery and the utilized redox chemistry, size-exclusion or ion-selective membranes can be employed. Various materials are used and there are many trademarks offering commercial products. However, because of the important role of membranes in the FB's performance and cost, significant research efforts are focused on improvements of their stability, selectivity, conductivity, secondary treatment, synthesis methods, and reduction of the production price.70–80
The last subsystem to be mentioned is the battery management system (BMS), which contains sensors, signal analyzing software, and controllers that maintain compliance between the ideal and the real battery parameters.3 The BMS will be discussed in greater detail in Section 5.3.
2.2. FB types
Over the past decades, several different types of flow batteries have evolved, which mainly differ in the physical and the chemical nature of the utilized redox couples and solvents.
The most common type of flow batteries is the redox flow battery (RFB). It is characteristic for this type of battery that the redox-active materials remain in a liquid phase regardless of their redox state. FBs of this type usually show relatively high voltage efficiencies compared to other flow battery designs. However, RFBs usually possess lower volumetric capacities because of limitations in the solubility of the redox couples.
In hybrid flow batteries, the physical state of the redox-active material changes during the electrochemical reaction in one (type 1) or both (type 2) half-cells.81 These cells are largely represented by metal anodes such as zinc or lithium.81,82 Such systems enable higher volumetric capacity, because at least one of the redox states is present in a solid form. On the other hand, these systems commonly exhibit inferior voltage efficiencies compared to RFBs and may struggle with dendrite formation upon repetitive deposition and dissolution of the metal.83 Importantly, these systems generally do not offer an independent scalability of power and energy, as the size of the reactor already defines both power output and capacity by restricting the available space for the deposition of a solid phase.
Gaseous/liquid flow batteries can be regarded as a special hybrid system. They almost exclusively use abundant gasses such as air or hydrogen and are operated with metals or halides as counterparts.84–88 Their main advantage is the comparably low cost of their redox materials; however, state-of-the-art systems severely struggle with low voltage and energy efficiencies.
In a suspension flow battery, the solid phase is not monolithically deposited on the electrodes, but is represented by insoluble particles freely distributed in the electrolyte.89–91 Compared with hybrid FBs, such systems are capable of an independent scalability of battery power and energy. This FB type can achieve high volumetric capacities, nevertheless, suspension flow batteries struggle from low voltage efficiencies.
Flow batteries can further be classified by the nature of their electrolyte into aqueous and non-aqueous flow batteries. Systems of the latter type can be based on organic solvents, deep eutectic solvents, and ionic liquids.92 Although aqueous systems have the advantage of high ionic conductivities, the available theoretical electrochemical stability window of water is around 1.23 V, which, therefore, limits their volumetric energy density. However, some common electrode materials (e.g., graphite) and different supporting electrolytes show large overvoltages for water splitting, broadening the practically attainable voltage window to about 2 V.93 Additionally, water is easily accessible in the required purities, environmentally benign, non-flammable, and inexpensive. Nonetheless, some interesting redox couples are hardly soluble in or may be harmed by the nucleophilicity of aqueous solutions.94,95 In comparison to that, electrolytes based on organic solvents, such as nitriles or carbonates are often flammable, have a comparably high vapor pressure, may be toxic and show less ionic conductivity; however, they are in general electrochemically stable over a broader potential range and, therefore, allow higher volumetric energy densities.96,97
With the use of ionic liquids and deep eutectic solvents, the main drawbacks of non-aqueous solvents may be overcome, as both have comparably high vapor pressures and show increased conductivities. Ionic liquids may be designed to consist purely of the redox-active material, which may yield superior energy densities. However, they usually have higher viscosities and are comparably expensive, which limits their application in RFBs.92
2.3. Flow battery chemistries
Many different FB chemistries have been reported in the past two decades, ranging from inorganic, metal-based systems to all-organic active materials in various solvents.39,40,98–101
Metal-based systems use a solution or suspension of metal ions as active material. While mainly elements having d-electrons in the valence shell are utilized, some actinides or lanthanides as well as a few main group chemistries were proposed.
The most prominent example of this type is the VRFB.71 Nevertheless, several other systems based on, e.g., zinc,81 lithium,82 chromium,102 iron,103 and cerium104 are explored as well. Half-cells based on these metals are often combined with other suitable metals or halides (such as bromine) as counter electrodes and use aqueous electrolytes. The main challenges for metal-based systems represent the low ion-selectivity and high costs of the employed membranes, the fluctuating prices of the metals, and the usually high corrosivity of the electrolytes. Despite that, multivalent systems based on metals (e.g., the VRFB) may be easily implementable and offer simple rebalancing techniques to mitigate electrolyte imbalances caused by crossover (Section 5.1).105 Moreover, in particular transition metal ions may be used in metalorganic compounds, such as ferrocene, or with organic ligands forming stable complexes such as ferrocyanide and others.106–109 Depending on the coordination sphere, electrochemical or physical properties of the material are tunable, while the stability of the ligand and its binding strength to the metal ion may create a vulnerability for capacity loss. This is seen for instance for the stability of iron complexes both during pH changes and long-term storage.110
In contrast to their metal-based counterparts, organic-based systems employ redox-active organic materials, composed mainly of a combination of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms dissolved in an organic solvent, water, or a mixture thereof. Commonly used redox-active organic scaffolds include quinones, viologens, and aminoxyl radicals.111 In contrast to chemically indestructible metal ions, organic molecules are prone to decomposition, leading to a decrease in accessible battery capacity and a continuous change of the electrolyte composition. Advantages of organic systems, however, are the theoretically unlimited abundance of chemical precursors, a greater independence from commodity prices, and the chemically tunable electrochemical properties of the molecules, as recently exemplified by quinones.112 It is furthermore possible to use less corrosive electrolyte mixtures, compared to, e.g., metals, which often require strongly acidic electrolyte conditions to achieve a viable solubility.113
2.4. Battery and electrolyte parameters

2.4.1. Parameter definition. 
The monitoring of FBs comprises the in situ/online and ex situ/offline measurement of the most important physical and chemical parameters of the electrolyte, the operational parameters of the flow cell (stack), and the technical parameters of the FB as a whole. In this section, the most important parameters are briefly defined as a basis for later discussions (see Table 1).

Technical parameters are the most relevant parameters in terms of practical application. They provide information on the general battery output and performance characteristics. In combination with economical evaluations, these parameters are highly valuable to decide whether the employment of a particular battery technology is profitable for a specific storage scenario, such as power quality regulation, bridging power, or energy management.114 Although other storage applications can be considered,115,116 the aforementioned examples already illustrate the variety of tasks to be solved. Consequently, the list of technical parameters required to provide sufficient information to choose an energy storage technology (EST) suiting any specific storage scenario is long. In this review, we restrict the discussion to the technical parameters related to FB electrolyte characterization and monitoring techniques (see Table 1). A broader parameter overview can be found in reviews dedicated to the comparison of existing EST.116–119
In fact, technical parameters are no fixed values. They are determined and driven by the physicochemical (electrolyte) parameters (PCPs), the battery design, and the operational parameters. The PCPs and the battery design, in turn, are usually fixed or cannot be altered directly during the battery operation. They determine the fundamental characteristics like the battery equilibrium voltage (Eeq), electrolyte thermodynamic potential (ETD), cut off voltage (UCO), theoretical total electrolyte capacity (QE), volumetric electrolyte capacity (qEV), power rating (Pmax), power ramp rate (vP), response time (τr) and temperature cut offs (Tco).
Operational parameters can be directly manipulated by the battery operator or the battery management system to adjust the battery's technical characteristics to the required values (see Table 1). In a sense, operational parameters represent input parameters that are converted by the fundamental battery characteristics (PCPs and design) into the resulting battery performance characteristics (technical parameters).
The interactions and interdependencies between technical parameters, operational parameters, physicochemical parameters, and the battery design are highly complex. Their basic interconnections are discussed in Section 2.4.2. However, the design parameters and their impact on the FB performance are not within the scope of this review and detailed information on this can be found elsewhere3,45,50,65,68 (see also the references of Section 2.1). The contribution of each PCP to the battery performance is discussed comprehensively in Section 3 of this review.


2.4.2. General interconnections among technical, operational, and physicochemical parameters. 
Operational and physicochemical electrolyte parameters are related to the technical parameters by diverse and complex interactions. Furthermore, the PCPs often influence each other on a fundamental level. For example, the electrolyte viscosity not only affects the total energy of the periphery WSU (as a technical parameter), but also the mass transfer coefficients mO/R and the pressure drop Δp (as PCPs). A detailed quantitative description of these interdependencies requires the evaluation of a complex set of equations, which include physical laws of battery thermodynamics, reaction kinetics, mass transfer, hydraulics, electrodynamics, and engineering aspects. A comprehensive discussion of the underlying mathematics can be found in the literature on flow battery simulations such as, e.g., the review on VRFB modelling approaches by Quiong et al.,120 or the detailed investigations of Yang et al.,121 Xiao et al.,48 Fu et al.,122 Tang et al.,123 Bhattacharjee et al.,124 and Trovo et al.125 Theoretical considerations for suspension-based batteries can be found, for example, in the work of Smith et al.126 This section does not aim at establishing a complete overview of all the complex parameter interdependencies. Here, we provide the reader with an impression and a qualitative understanding of the major interconnections that need to be considered. Fig. 3 summarizes the qualitative discussion of this section and might provide a simple “look-up scheme” for the most important parameter dependencies. Starting at the parameter of interest in this figure and following the arrows reveals the major interdependencies for this specific parameter.
 Fig. 3  Hierarchy of interconnections of FB technical, operational and physicochemical parameters. Operational parameters are orange, physicochemical parameters as well as transition values defining them are green and technical parameters are blue. 
Our discussion of the parameter interconnections is focused on the four most important technical battery characteristics (bigger outer circles in Fig. 3): battery stability, nominal battery energy capacity, battery round trip efficiency, and nominal battery power. The battery stability is closely connected to the chemical composition and volume of the primary electrolytes and is influenced by irreversible processes like electrolyte decomposition or leakages (see Section 4.3) and by reversible processes like, e.g., reactant and solvent crossover which can be (partially) reversed by suitable capacity recovery procedures (see Section 5.1). To obtain a long battery lifetime, the electrolytes’ temperatures, states-of-charge, and the battery voltage have to be kept within optimal working ranges. For example, higher temperatures increase the vapor pressure of the electrolytes and, thereby, increase the evaporation rate and facilitate parasitic processes causing capacity fade, such as side-reactions and active material precipitation.71 Lower temperatures, on the other hand, might facilitate precipitation or cause a phase transition of the solvent.71 In general, the electrolyte temperature is influenced by the heat transfer between the whole battery system and its environment123 and depends on the heat generated during operation of the battery. This heat usually originates from, for example, the current flow (i.e., due to ohmic resistances of battery components), exothermic crossover processes, and the liquid viscous friction during the electrolyte flow. According to investigations of fluid dynamics in chromatographic systems by Kaczmarski et al.,127 the high pressure gradient along a flow system can cause significant heat generation. While this may not have a significant effect in a single FB cell having a comparably small pressure drop of up to 0.22 MPa at 20 cm s−1 linear flow velocity,3 viscous friction may produce a substantial amount of heat in a cell stack with dozens of such cells. In some installations, battery systems utilize a heat exchanger, which is managed by the BMS to maintain the optimal temperature during operation (see Section 5.3). Another important aspect for battery stability is the choice of the voltage limits. Basically, all electrolytes exhibit side reactions of the redox-active species, the solvent, and/or the supporting electrolyte as well as corrosion of battery components if the battery voltage exceeds pre-determined voltage limits (i.e., the voltage cut-off values, Ulim). Moreover, voltages below a predefined minimum value may cause the shutdown of the battery periphery, such as pumps, electrical energy inverters, and the BMS. In order to avoid this, the battery voltage U is controlled by the BMS depending on demand and supply of the grid (Section 5.3).
The nominal battery energy is defined by the average nominal discharge voltage, , and the nominal battery capacity, Qn. The latter is, in turn, dependent on the electrolyte capacity, QE, and the utilization factor, u (see eqn (2.7)). While Qn is a fixed value, u is directly affected by the applicable voltage limits, Ulim, and the battery voltage load, U, as well as the battery current load, I. U, in turn, depends on the battery equilibrium voltage, Eeq, and the sum of all overvoltages ∑η = U − Eeq (see eqn (2.25)) in the battery, which are caused by diverse loss mechanisms. A reduction of ∑η at fixed Ulim, therefore, improves the utilization of the theoretically possible battery capacity. On the other hand, Eeq depends on the equilibrium potentials of each electrolyte, EEeq, which is determined according to the Nernst equation (eqn (2.35)) by the species’ standard redox potential, the number of transferred electrons, the electrolyte temperature, and the activity of the species participating in the reaction (see eqn (2.10), (2.35)).13,128,129EEeq directly depends on the concentration ratio of the oxidized and reduced species and, thus, on the electrolytes‘ state-of-charge, SOCE (see eqn (4.2) and Section 4.1). With regard to this and the previous discussion, lower battery ∑η at fixed Ulim directly yield a higher accessible SOCE range and, hence, an increase in u. In the absence of severe electrolyte imbalances and at negligibly small battery capacity fade rates, qBf, an increase of the utilized SOCE range causes an increase of the accessible battery state-of-charge (SOCB) range and, consequently, yields a higher QB and u. Furthermore, an increased Eeq corresponds to a higher battery energy capacity, WB, at fixed QB and vice versa. The battery overvoltages, ∑η, comprise three main contributions: ohmic (ηohm = IRohm), activation or kinetic (ηk), and mass-transfer (ηmt) overvoltages.4,130ηohm depends on all ohmic resistances of the current-carrying battery components (e.g., current collectors, bipolar plates, electrodes, electrolytes, and membranes). ηk originates from the activation energy barrier of the heterogeneous electron transfer between electrode and redox-active substance at the surfaces of the battery electrodes.129 It is related to the electrode area, the reactant concentration, c, the number of transferred electrons, ze, the charge transfer coefficient, and the exchange current density, i0. ηmt originates from limitations of the mass transfer of the redox-active substances to the electrode surface. The overall mass transfer is governed by diffusion, migration, and/or convection. The diffusion part represents the movement of species along the concentration gradient between the electrode surface and the bulk electrolyte. Its rate is governed by the diffusion coefficient, which depends on, e.g., the electrolyte viscosity and temperature. The migration represents the movement of ions in the electric potential gradient of the cell. It depends on the potential distribution across the electrochemical reactor, the ion's charge number, and its concentration. The convection contribution originates from the bulk movement of the electrolyte along a pressure gradient and is determined by the battery design, the flow regime (i.e., laminar, turbulent, transition state), and the flow rate.129
In general, the temperature significantly influences the respective overvoltages. Mass transfer and activation overpotentials are reduced at higher temperatures, while the temperature-dependency of the ohmic polarization strongly depends on the sort of electric conductor. With increasing temperature, the conductivity of first order conductors decreases, while second order conductors show higher conductivities. If the overall cell conductivity is limited by the second order conductors’ (i.e., membrane and electrolyte) resistances, it can be concluded that higher temperatures also mitigate ohmic overvoltages. During battery charging, the polarization increases the overall battery voltage and vice versa when the battery is discharging. As a consequence, u exhibits an inversely proportional dependency to ∑η. At the same time, higher ∑η cause a reduction of the voltage efficiency, VE, and, subsequently, a negative contribution to the energy efficiency, EE, and the round-trip efficiency, EERT.
The battery round trip efficiency, EERT, is defined by the energy efficiency (EE) of the flow cell and the additional energy consumption of the side-units (WSU) (e.g., the pumps, power inverters, BMS, and heat exchangers) during a full charge–discharge cycle. WSU significantly depends on the battery operation strategy. For example, a longer charge/discharge duration, tc/d directly translates to an increased energy consumption of the peripheral components. The power consumed by the pumps represents the major contribution to energy losses and is comprehensively reviewed in the literature.4,48,121,122,124,130–135 In short, the pumping power is mainly determined by the hydraulic pressure drop Δp. The latter depends on the electrolyte viscosity, μ, the electrolyte density, ρ, its flow rate, vfl, and the respective flow regime (FR). The FR is influenced by vfl, component geometries, and wall roughnesses. In the porous electrodes, for example, the flow regime is usually considered as laminar,4,48,121,130,131,135 while in other battery sections (e.g., tanks, pipes, etc.) it can be either laminar or turbulent.4 The design plays a crucial role for determining the transitions from laminar to turbulent FRs with increasing vfl. In addition to all that, both μ and ρ are significantly affected by temperature; therefore, temperature variations during operation contribute to Δp. While an increase in Δp results in a growth of WSU and, subsequently, may have a negative impact on EERT at fixed μ and ρ, it also results in a higher vfl. In contrast to that, the latter facilitates convective mass transport in the porous electrodes and, consequently, decreases ∑η causing u and VE to increase. Due to the dependence of EERT on EE this reduction of ∑η can have a positive effect on EERT and, therefore, might overcompensate the negative impact of increased Δp at higher vfl. In the majority of publications devoted to battery performance evaluations, the changes in ∑η are usually expressed by the voltage efficiency, VE, which is one of the EE contributors. The coulombic efficiency, CE, as the second contributor is mainly determined by the ratio of the sum of shunt currents, ISh, membrane crossover currents, Ico, and faradaic currents, IF, to the total battery current load, I (see eqn (2.24)). IF is the actual current utilized for the charging/discharging of the redox couple. ISh comprises the current losses caused by the current flow between the individual cells of a cell stack through the electrolyte channels and cell manifolds. It is dependent on both battery design and stack voltage. Ico represents the current losses originating from crossover of the redox-active species between the half-cells. It is governed by the mass transfer (i.e., diffusion, migration, and convection) across the membrane in accordance with its permeability characteristics. Crossover effects and shunt currents can significantly reduce a flow battery's CE.136,137 However, such crossover effects vary with the battery/electrolyte state and the battery's operating regime. For example, when a RFB is left at standby there is no convective contribution to the mass transfer of the redox species across the membrane and, therefore, Ico is usually decreased in this operating regime. In turn, Ico is usually larger during pumped operation. As a result, a large tc/d (i.e., an increased operation time of the pumps at fixed values of all other parameters) corresponds to increased capacity losses caused by Ico. Furthermore, I is closely connected to the overvoltages ∑η in the flow battery. Since IF represents the main component of I, a plot of I over U (i.e., a so-called polarization curve, Fig. 6) enables the evaluation of the different overvoltage contributions (Section 3.2).138 It is also noteworthy that a higher I leads to a decrease in tc/d and, consequently, to a reduction of WSU, Ico, and less time for parasitic reactions. All this can improve CE.139 On the other hand, large values of I induce higher ∑η and, consequently, lead to a decrease in VE, EE, EERT, and u.

3. Electrolyte characterization methods
Many of the methods and techniques presented in this section have been briefly discussed in reviews with a different focus.37,140 However, in order to provide a comprehensive overview of the available techniques in one place and to highlight recent progresses, this section presents the methods particularly interesting for electrolyte characterizations. An overview of the herein discussed methods is given in Tables 4 and 5. Additionally, we provide literature references for each technique in order to highlight the unexploited potentials for FB electrolyte characterization. Although the performance of a FB clearly depends on several additional factors, such as the condition of the cell components (e.g., membranes and electrodes) or the individual properties of a specific type of FB (e.g., hybrid FBs), the discussion of these factors is beyond the scope of this review and has been excellently reviewed by others as highlighted in Sections 1 and 2.

3.1. Chemical electrolyte characterization
The chemical characterization of an electrolyte plays a vital role for flow batteries. The methods in this section represent typical techniques used by synthetic and analytical chemists. They focus on the analysis of the composition of the electrolyte (solvent, supporting electrolytes, and active substances) and changes thereof, including the structure, interactions, and stability of the solvent, the redox couples, and additives. Most chemical characterization tools require operators skilled in the art, are based on stand-alone devices, often consume the sample of interest, and require thorough sample preparation. In this regard, they usually represent typical offline or ex situ characterization tools; hitherto, only spectroscopy-based methods have been occasionally applied as chemical online monitoring tools in flow batteries.

3.1.1. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. 
NMR spectroscopy is an irreplaceable tool for the non-destructive and detailed investigation of chemical structures, molecular dynamics, and concentrations. Due to the complexity and size of the apparatus, its demand for energy and cooling, the general strength of the generated magnetic fields, the temperature-dependency of the measurement, and the common use of deuterated solvents for liquid NMR techniques, it is a typical offline tool. However, in situ measurements are possible using additional equipment.141–143
Its measurement principle is based on the quantization of the nuclear spin, which results in a splitting of the corresponding nuclear energy levels in an external magnetic field. As different nuclei (of the same element) vary in their local magnetic environment, the detectable resonance absorption of electromagnetic waves (radio frequencies) upon excitation of the nuclear spins to these energy levels is not equal. From this absorption spectrum, the operator can infer the chemical structure of a molecule.144 If an internal standard is used, the concentration of all nuclei in relation to the standard is quantifiable. Due to the comparably low excitation energy, the sensitivity of the technique is rather limited at ambient temperatures, leading to an unfavorable signal-to-noise-ratio. Hence, the amount of sample required for a measurement is comparably high. Although hydrogen nuclei are the most utilized reference nuclei for NMR spectroscopy, a wide range of nuclei like 13C, 31P, 15N, 17O, 19F or 51V are common.145 Several solid-state NMR techniques for batteries have been excellently reviewed.146 Liquid-based NMR techniques have only been applied to a low extend in this research field. However, the technique can provide valuable information on, e.g., electrolytes of organic-based active materials and is, thus, used for investigations of stability and structural interactions.15,142,147–152 The application of this technique for aqueous-based VRFB electrolytes has been reviewed by Choi et al.,71 whereas further examples for the use of NMR in aqueous and organic VRFB electrolytes were published elsewhere.153–157 NMR was, furthermore, used for the investigations of other metal-based RFB electrolytes as well.158


3.1.2. UV/vis spectroscopy. 
Although providing limited structural information as well, UV/vis spectroscopy is mainly used for the determination of analyte concentrations. At wavelengths ranging from approximately 200 to 1000 nm, the photon energy is sufficient to excite a valence electron from an occupied molecular orbital to an unoccupied one. After a linear calibration of the device using a set of solutions of known concentrations, this absorption process can be utilized to determine the concentration of a (optically thin) solution by the Beer–Lambert law. The simplicity of the method and its non-destructive nature enable an easy implementation as an online tool (see Fig. 4). It is widely applied for concentration and SOC measurements in vanadium-based159–195 and organic-based RFB electrolytes.12,196 The method's sensitivity strongly depends on the extinction coefficient. Many electrolyte compositions show strong absorbances for the wavelength of interest and, consequently, require adequate dilution or the employment of extremely thin cuvettes.159,163,168,172–175,177 Another problem may be the interaction of solution species by, e.g., complexation, which can cause a strongly nonlinear dependence.161,165

3.1.3. Infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy. 
IR spectroscopy can be equally suited for the determination of concentrations in RFB electrolytes. Furthermore, with wavelengths ranging from 750 nm to about one millimeter, IR radiation is capable of exciting rotational and vibrational modes of a molecular dipole. Due to these modes, IR spectra provide significant structural information suitable for the investigation of the composition and the stability of the electrolyte system as well as interactions within it, as exemplified by Herr et al.176 The method is used for concentration-dependent measurements, such as SOC monitoring, as well (Section 4.1.4).197,198
Although having a different physical background, Raman spectroscopy enables similar structural investigations which are often complementary to those obtained by IR spectroscopy. The method relies on the measurement of energy differences between scattered light and the incident beam of a monochromatic source (typically a laser). It is frequently employed for the investigation of solid surfaces (like electrodes or membranes), but has also been applied for the SOC determination199 as well as to gain information about the molecular structure of VRFB electrolytes.140,200,201


3.1.4. Mass spectrometry (MS). 
Mass spectrometry is based on the measurement of the ratio of mass and ionic charge of a molecular or atomic particle. For the measurement, the sample is first ionized. Subsequently, the generated ions are accelerated using an electrical field and are separated in a magnetic field. A detector then quantifies the portion of a certain mass increment. In the process of ionization, the molecular bonds tend to break (fragmentation), generating further information about the molecular structure of the analyte. However, for substance mixtures, the fragmentation process adds complexity to the data, making it difficult to assign a fragment to a specific substance. Therefore, the value of the method can be drastically increased by the addition of a substance separation step, commonly realized by installing a chromatography column (gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC)) prior to the ionizer. Column and carrier medium have to be suitable for the substance of interest.
Combinations of electrochemical cells and mass spectrometric analyzers are commonly used in analytical chemistry, which may be evidenced by the numerous reviews and book chapters about historical backgrounds,202 general aspects,203 ionization techniques,204 and cell designs.205 The available methods include direct couplings of electrochemical cells with MS devices as well as couplings with chromatography- and membrane-based separators prior to the MS device. This enables the detection of short-lived intermediates, by-products, or adducts formed during the redox reactions at the electrodes. Typically, measurements are performed in customized cells developed for this purpose, which allow for an easy and fast sampling;206–208 however, a manual transfer with syringes is used as well.209 Drawbacks of these MS-methods are high equipment costs, limitations to electrolytes suitable for the selected ionization technique, background noise due to the supporting electrolyte, and unwanted deposits in the MS device. Nevertheless, there have been applications of these techniques to electrolytes promising for flow batteries.206,210 Another MS-based technique of interest for RFB electrolyte investigations may be the inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-MS setup. For this technique, the electrolyte is evaporated in a high-temperature plasma, ionizing the sample completely. This technique is especially interesting for metal-based active materials and enables the quantitation of the active material and impurities. It was recently used for the trace metal analysis of a VRFB electrolyte211 and the determination of cerium in a Zn/Ce-RFB electrolyte.212 However, it is rarely used and competes with methods producing similar results such as Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) and Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (AES).


3.1.5. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and atomic emission spectroscopy (AES). 
Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and atomic emission spectroscopy (AES) (also called optical emission spectroscopy, OES) represent methods that can produce quantitative results about the elemental composition of a sample. They are in particular valuable for samples containing metal ions or metalloids and are frequently used for trace metal analyses.213 The methods are based on the atomization of the sample using high temperatures, generated by various means. The excited elements then produce a characteristic spectrum of specific wavelengths. In AAS, light is absorbed by the generated atoms, while AES systems use the light emitted by the atoms and ions excited at the very high temperatures. These temperatures are created by electrical discharges or an ICP. Using these techniques, only the total amount of an element in a sample is detectable, regardless of its redox state in the electrolyte used. ICP-AES was used for investigations of VRFB electrolytes.214–216


3.1.6. Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. 
ESR (or electron paramagnetic resonance, EPR) spectroscopy is comparable to the NMR technique, but relies on the spin of unpaired electrons in a sample. It is, therefore, sensitive to organic radicals, such as aminoxyl radicals, as well as many d-group metals in various oxidation states. The method is frequently applied for the characterization of solid materials (e.g., in batteries having solid active materials217) but is applicable to liquid samples as well. EPR measurements of liquid electrolytes have been reported in metal-based electrolytes, preferably for membrane permeability tests in VRFBs,218–220 but also for structure and stability investigations.221,222 Similarly, the stability of organic-based active materials in various electrolyte systems were examined.223–226 It was utilized for SOC measurement as well (Section 4.1.4).197,227,228 Due to the low signal-to-noise ratio, the measurement error can be comparably large. Furthermore, interpretations of ESR spectra can be difficult for substances with several unpaired electrons (e.g., high-spin metal complexes) or for interactions with nuclear spins.


3.1.7. Redox titrations. 
Titrations are typical offline tools to determine concentrations of a redox-active species in solution and are, consequently, suited for FB electrolyte characterizations. A titrant solution of known concentration, which contains molecules undergoing a defined reaction with the analyte, is added to an analyte solution. The concentration of the analyte can be derived from the exact titrant volume added until the equilibrium point of the reaction is reached. Commonly applied titration techniques include cerimetry, iodometry, and permanganometry. The equilibrium point is either indicated by a color change of the solution or a potential change measured versus a reference electrode (potentiometry). Such titrations are performed for inorganic active materials as well as their organic counterparts.150,168,169,184,229–233 Furthermore, other titration techniques such as acid–base titrations are used for basic electrolyte characterizations.234–236 Titrations consume the analyte and, thus, represent typical ex situ tools. The detection error varies strongly and depends on the titration technique, the concentration of the titrant, the operator (when the equivalence point is detected by eye only), and the utilized equipment. Despite that, it is a reliable tool applied, e.g., for the ex situ SOC and SOH analysis of FB electrolytes (see Sections 4.1.2 and 4.2).


3.1.8. Elemental analysis (EA). 
EA represents a classical characterization tool for the composition analysis of organic compounds. The conventional EA starts with the chemical combustion of the sample material using pure oxygen and is followed by the separation of the generated volatile oxides using a gas chromatograph. The sample is, thus, completely consumed. EA is strongly limited to the analysis of organic materials. Some inorganic ions may indeed interfere with the measurement, which makes additives and catalysts mandatory for the measurement of FB electrolytes containing ions that are commonly used for supporting electrolytes (e.g., sodium).237 Furthermore, the substance mass has to be precisely known and, therefore, samples are generally provided as dry solids. Consequently, any FB electrolyte sample needs to be solvent-free prior to analysis. Nevertheless, especially for electrolytes based on organic active materials or supporting electrolytes, the method may provide valuable information. In this context, for example, Heo et al. used EA to determine the residual organic content in a VRFB electrolyte.211

3.2. Electrochemical methods
In contrast to the purely chemical characterization techniques, electrochemical methods rely on the measurement of voltages and currents to characterize a FB electrolyte. They require electrodes to be in direct contact with the electrolyte solution – either in situ in flow batteries or ex situ in specialized electrochemical cells. An electrochemical cell usually consists of a vessel (in some cases divided in sections connected by selective second order conductors) and working (WE), reference (RE), and counter electrodes (CE). The electric potential of the WE is usually controlled with reference to the RE. At the WE, the electrochemical reaction of interest is taking place and, thus, the WE has to be inert with respect to any electrolyte component within the applied potential range. The processes at the CE are counter-balancing the number of electrons transferred during the reaction at the WE. These processes can involve double layer charging, active substance reduction/oxidation, or parasitic reactions such as solvent electrolysis. Any included RE should have a stable potential in the utilized solution in order to enable defined control of the WE's potential. For the investigation of FBs, REs are utilized to assess individual half-cell and electrolyte parameters.238–240 Examples for standard REs include Ag/AgCl and Hg/HgCl2 electrodes for aqueous systems and Ag/AgNO3 electrodes for non-aqueous systems. Regardless of the cell setup, not only the electrolyte itself, but also the cell geometry and the electrode–electrolyte interface have a significant impact on the system's response to an electrical perturbation via overvoltage contribution to the voltage response of a cell (see Section 2.4). The current signal can be generally divided into a faradaic component, which involves the electron transfer processes between electrode and electrolyte, and a non-faradaic component, which stems from capacitive processes in the electrochemical double layer.129 With regard to this, flow batteries are two-electrode electrochemical cells in which most of the current is carried by faradaic processes, while comparably low non-faradaic currents occur. Different electrochemical techniques can be employed to obtain technical and physicochemical parameters of, e.g., the battery as a whole, the electrode–electrolyte interface, the membranes, and the electrolyte. An overview of important electrochemical characterization techniques is provided in the following subsections.

3.2.1. Cell cycling. 
The simplest electrochemical in situ characterization method of a FB is represented by cell cycling. It is usually performed in two modes: galvanostatic (constant current) or potentiostatic (constant potential) cycling. Although constant current/voltage profiles prevail in FB research, any current or voltage signal can be applied (e.g., constant power modes). In both cycling modes, the total battery capacity, QB, or the energy capacity, WB, can be obtained (see Table 1). Using the capacities of successive charge and discharge half-cycles, the coulombic efficiency, CE, the voltage efficiency, VE, and the energy efficiency, EE, for each cycle can be calculated. Additionally, using the coulomb-counting method, SOC and SOH values can be estimated (Sections 4.1 and 4.2). Specifically designed battery cycling experiments enable the assessment of, e.g., utilization factors, cycle as well as calendar lifetimes, charge/discharge times, capacity fade rates, and response times. In particular for long-term stability investigations in RFBs, cell cycling represents an irreplaceable tool (Sections 3.2 and 4.3). Despite that, full cell cycling experiments are currently increasingly criticized because of several intrinsic downsides.15,23,43 The most striking disadvantage is the lack of sufficient information on half-cell or electrolyte stability, which makes it highly difficult to unravel specific causes for capacity fade rates. In order to obtain satisfactory half-cell information in RFBs, Darling and Perry were the first to apply a symmetrical cell setup utilizing only the electrolyte of interest in the both half-cells (Fig. 5),241 which was subsequently advanced and successfully applied for other electrolytes.15,108,242–245 Symmetric cell setups decrease the impact of crossover in the FB, while still exposing the active material to cycling conditions.43 A comprehensive overview of setups for cell cycling was given by Nölle et al., recently.246
 Fig. 5  Schematic representation of an unbalanced compositionally symmetric cell setup. Both half-cells comprise the same electrolyte, initially charged to 50% SOC, with different capacities, as defined by their electrolyte volumes. 
Despite its advantages, cell cycling always records all processes leading to a current or voltage response, regardless of their origin. Other techniques might be applied, in order to obtain a deeper insight into the specific electrochemical processes involved.


3.2.2. Direct current (DC) techniques for overvoltage analyses. 
Several methods have been developed that deal with the investigation of the overvoltages (Section 2.4.2) within a flow cell and the quantification of its components247,248 as well as the additional complications of analysis by non-faradaic currents.249 Among the methods which enable the assessment of overvoltages are DC techniques (e.g., polarization curves or interruptive measurements) as well as AC-based techniques (e.g., impedance spectroscopy). Simple polarization curve experiments rely on the measurement of voltage–current curves.37,247,250 As mentioned earlier (Section 2.4.2), all the contributions to the overall overvoltage in the cell occur to different extents and prevail at specific zones of the polarization curve (Fig. 6). Linear parts in the current–voltage dependency indicate ohmic losses, while non-linear behaviors in the high current regions can be attributed mostly to mass-transport limitations and a non-linear voltage–current development in the low current region is commonly assigned to the activation resistance of the redox reactions.37 The recorded data are generally plotted as voltage over current density or as the product of both (power density) over the normalized current. Typically, polarization measurements are used for the basic assessment and estimation of limiting overpotential contributions.37,247 Furthermore, they are used to measure the maximum output power at a given SOC and design of the cell. Closely related to polarization curve measurements are interruptive techniques, such as current interruption (CI) and the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT). During cycling of a cell, the applied current is switched off, resulting in a time-dependent voltage drop. The main part of this voltage drop is caused by ohmic and activation resistances. They are responsible for the almost immediate overvoltage drop after the current interruption, while the rest of the overvoltage continuously decays over time and is caused in large part by the concentration overpotentials at the electrodes.251 For GITT, this process is periodically repeated within a charging/discharging segment of a battery cycling experiment. It is commonly used in conventional batteries for the measurement of diffusion coefficients or the determination of the equilibrium potentials at different SOCs. However, it may only provide limited information for flow batteries due to their increased mass transport to the electrode during operation.251 Although an overall estimation of the overvoltage may be possible, a general quantification of the individual contributions cannot be attained easily by CI techniques.37 More sophisticated methods like the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are required for that.
 Fig. 6  Schematic representation of a polarization curve with the contribution of different overvoltages in a flow cell.5 


3.2.3. Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). 
With the EIS technique, one can differentiate between the different time-dependent components contributing to the overall cell resistance. It is commonly applied in battery research in general252 and FB electrolyte parameters may similarly be obtained in separate measurement cells. There are two measurement modes: while in PEIS (potentiostatic EIS) an AC voltage signal for system perturbation is applied and the current response is observed, the GEIS (galvanostatic EIS) technique works vice versa. During the measurement, the frequency of the AC signal is varied. Both modes usually generate equal results if the electrochemical properties of the system do not change over the measurement time. Since the causes for the different overvoltage contributions evolve on different time scales, the measured response to the AC perturbation signal is frequency dependent. Generally, for systems that evolve slowly in time (e.g., batteries), the frequency of the AC perturbation is varied one by one. However, if systems do not show large faradaic currents, long EIS measurements can become inaccurate.253 For these systems, techniques comprising a mathematical transformation have been developed which rely on an excitation signal of superimposed frequencies. A Fourier transformation of the response signal then provides the desired frequency domain. This method exhibits measurement times as low as several milliseconds.249,254 For the analysis, the battery is usually approximated by an equivalent circuit model composed of resistors, capacitors, inductors, and specific electrochemical elements. These elements represent the physicochemical processes in the battery and their values are obtained by fitting the mathematical equation behind the circuit model to the experimental impedance spectra.129 In particular, impedance values for the activation and ohmic resistances as well as the double-layer capacitances can be directly obtained.255 For visualization, the impedance values are either displayed as a function of frequency (Bode plot) or using the real and imaginary part of the impedance (Nyquist plot).


3.2.4. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and rotating disc electrode (RDE). 
Potential sweep and step methods represent some of the fundamental techniques in electrochemistry and are, thus, highly suitable for the assessment of FB electrolyte parameters. Two of the most frequently applied methods in FB research are the CV and RDE measurements. However, both were reviewed as diagnostic tools before and, thus, we only provide basic information in this section and refer to the respective literature for deeper insights.37,129,256–258
Cyclic voltammetry is a wide-spread, easily implementable, and fast method, which is frequently applied to characterize electrolytes.259 In the commonly utilized three-electrode-setup, the potential of the WE (versus the RE) is linearly swept back and forth in a defined potential range at various and usually constant (potential) scan rates. The resulting current response from the sample electrolyte is composed of non-faradaic/capacitive and faradaic components. The non-faradaic currents are usually compensated during data analysis by subtraction of an initially recorded scan in the electrolyte prior to adding the redox-active substance (“blank”). The faradaic processes, on the other hand, cause the typical, peak-shaped signal in the voltammogram: in equilibrium, the ion concentrations throughout the solution are virtually constant. At sufficiently high potentials, however, the redox couple reacts at the electrode's surface causing a deviation from the equilibrium concentration distribution. Diffusive mass transport of unreacted ions to the surface is, subsequently, driven by the increasing concentration gradient between electrode surface and bulk electrolyte. At the peak of the curve, this mass transport becomes the rate-determining step of the reaction. A further increase of the potential, consequently, has no effect on the current response of the system. Instead, the current monotonically decreases due to the continuous expansion of the diffusion layer. Upon reversal of the scan direction, the same processes take place for the other redox-species resulting in a second peak.259 The resulting voltammograms enable the evaluation of the electrochemical reversibility of the reaction: for an ideally reversible reaction, for example, the ratio of cathodic and anodic peak currents equals one, while the peaks show a separation of 57/ze mV. Furthermore, the peak currents are directly proportional to the square root of the scan rate (see Randles–Sevcik equation260,261) and the recorded peak potentials do not vary significantly with the scan rate. Irreversible or quasi-reversible redox reactions are indicated by specific deviations from these ideal values. However, even for virtually reversible reactions the experimentally observed peak separation may be higher than 57/ze mV if non-ideal experimental conditions are applied. For example, both the measured peak current ratio and the peak separation may contain errors due to the non-faradaic currents and the so-called IR drop.262 If careful experimentation is performed, however, the reaction rate constant of the electrochemical reaction (Nicholson method), the diffusion coefficient of the redox species (Randles–Sevcik/Cottrell equation), the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (ze), and the concentration can be estimated.129,259
Another commonly applied technique to obtain fundamental parameters of the redox couple is the rotating disc electrode voltammetry. The WE in this method is configured as a rotating disk-shaped electrode (see Fig. 7a). With the rotation of the WE at a defined, constant rate, a laminar convection of the electrolyte to the electrode surface is induced, which causes a steady concentration profile of active species at the electrode surface. At sufficiently high voltages, where mass-transfer limiting conditions prevail at the electrode surface, limiting currents are measured (Fig. 7b). The technique is frequently employed for the measurement of rate constants and diffusion coefficients of the redox couples by using the Levich and Koutecky–Levich analysis (Fig. 7c).129,229,263

The linear slope contains the diffusion coefficient, as determinable by the Levich-equation.1 (Copyright©2016, Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA.) 
Other commonly encountered methods include staircase and sinusoidal voltammetry as well as pulsed techniques such as square-wave voltammetry. They usually allow a deeper insight into the electrochemical processes occurring at the electrode, e.g., the discrimination of capacitive and faradaic contributions in a voltammogram.249,264


3.2.5. Spectroelectrochemical methods. 
Apart from the presented chemical methods and electrochemical diagnostic tools, combinations of both are frequently employed as well. Combinations of chemical and electrochemical tools include couplings of electrochemical measurements with spectroscopic techniques (spectroelectrochemistry), such as UV/vis, IR, Raman or NMR as well as MS couplings.265 The most prominent example is the commonly applied combination of voltammetric techniques and UV/vis spectroscopy. Such measurements are usually used for the investigation of the redox-active materials in batteries and are especially valuable for the instantaneous detection and characterization of short-lived intermediates.266,267 In FBs, spectroelectrochemical measurements have been exploited, e.g., for the characterization of organic substances,268–270 metal-based271–274 as well as other electrolytes.275 However, again we would like to refer to the respective literature for further insight into the utilization of these techniques.265,276,277

3.3. pH value
In both inorganic and organic aqueous flow batteries, the pH value of the electrolyte and its variation during (dis-)charging can fundamentally influence the reaction of the redox couple. The pH value is defined as the negative logarithm of the hydrogen ion activity (see eqn (2.34)) and, in general, it's value is temperature-dependent and can vary strongly during flow battery charge and discharge processes. The pH value is only defined for water-based electrolytes and, as a consequence, only has an impact on aqueous FBs. However, a large part of FB research and commercialized systems employ water as an electrolyte base due to its high electrolyte conductivity and low cost. In the current FB literature, a pH range from −0.24 to 14 is encountered in various electrolyte compositions. Due to the high hydrogen and hydroxide ion mobilities, pH alterations can cause a variation of the electrolyte conductivity; due to this, batteries with extreme pH values often exhibit higher conductivities. In addition to that, the pH can affect the stability of the redox-active substances,95,245,278–280 their solubility,147,281,282 the general stability of the electrolyte,283,284 the redox potential of the redox-active species,285–289 the electrolyte corrosivity, and the environmental safety.290–292 In terms of the technical parameters, the pH value influences the VE, EE, Qn, Un, Wn, Lcal, and Lcyc. Therefore, its measurement is essential for an optimal and stable battery operation. The number of approaches to measure a solution's pH is large. We will, therefore, cover only the most common methods here.

3.3.1. Harned cell. 
This is the standard method suggested by the IUPAC. The measurement is performed in a so-called Harned cell using the following electrode configuration:293Pt|H2|buffer, solution of interest, Cl−|AgCl|Ag.While the method is a standard procedure for pH measurement, it is uncomfortable to use. In particular, the hydrogen flow can contaminate the analyte during the investigation.


3.3.2. Glass electrode. 
The glass electrode (Fig. 8a) relies on the measurement of junction potential differences across a glass membrane, which selectively interacts with the protons in the analyte solution. The setup uses the following configuration:2,129Ag|AgCl|Cl−‖solution of interest‖Cl−|AgCl|Ag,The glass membrane is placed between the two reference electrodes and is the only source of potential change in the system. Due to hydration of a thin layer of the silicate glass at the interface to the analyte solution, the voltage differences measured in different analyte solutions mainly originates from the varying proton activities in the analyte solutions. However, the absolute voltage value also depends on the specific setup and, consequently, a calibration in standard solutions is always required. Furthermore, several minutes are required to stabilize the voltage signal, the glass bulb is rather fragile, and drifts in the Ag/AgCl potential necessitate frequent recalibrations. Despite that, glass electrodes are comparably cheap, measurements are comfortable to perform, and they exhibit a high precision in a large pH range from 0 to 12. Beyond this range, special glass compositions should be applied in order to keep proton selectivity high.

3.3.3. Transistor-based sensors. 
In the transistor-based methods (Fig. 8b) an ion-selective layer (e.g., SiO2, Si3N4Ox, Al2O3 and Ta2O5)2,294 is coated on the gate contact of a conventional metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET), which is in direct contact with the analyte solution. Interaction of this layer with the protons in the solution causes an additional junction potential at the gate. This adds up to a bias voltage, which is applied between a RE in the solution and the source contact of the transistor. In response to this, the measured current flow between source and drain changes. The change of the gate voltage is, thus, directly related to the differences of pH values in different solutions. As a consequence, the current flow through the transistor can be utilized to assess the pH value of the solution after a suitable calibration. Various configurations can be used: ion-sensitive field effect transistor (ISFET), where the semiconductor between source and drain interfaces the sample solution through an ion-selective layer; extended gate field effect transistor (EGFET), where the gate is connected to an electrode coated with the ion-selective layer and immersed in the solution; interdigitated extended gate field effect transistor (IEGFET) that operates on the same principle as the EGFET, though the surface of the sensing electrode is significantly larger.2,294,295 Such sensors are mechanically robust, possess faster response times compared to glass electrodes, and have significantly smaller sizes. On the other hand, the stability of the ion-selective layer is limited, and they come with high costs.


3.3.4. Metal–metal oxide sensors. 
For these sensors, a metal oxide layer is coated on the surface of a metal electrode as an ion-sensitive layer. Among the well-studied oxides are TiO2, RuO2, RhO2, Ta2O5, IrO2, PtO2, and ZrO2.296,297 The pH value is determined by the measurement of the equilibrium potential of the metal oxide-coated electrode versus a reference electrode with a stable potential. Such sensors are mechanically robust, can be easily miniaturized, and can provide proton sensitivity superior to glass electrodes. However, they usually struggle with a lower range of stability, which is determined by the metal oxide, and their potential drift necessitates frequent recalibration.


3.3.5. Resistance measurement. 
Two electrical contacts are connected with a material, which exchanges protons with the solution of interest and, subsequently, changes its conductivity (chemiresistor).295 Such systems do not require a RE and, as a consequence, potential drift is avoided. In addition to that, their size can be even smaller than transistor-based and metal–metal oxide sensors. Gou et al. demonstrated a variant that covered a pH range from 2 to 12 and was stable for at least 120 days.298 Despite its interesting and promising approach, this sensor type represents an emerging technology and, hence, the attainable pH range, the sensitivity, and the selectivity require further evaluation.


3.3.6. Dyes and optical analysis. 
The method is based on the selective interaction of protons with various available dyes, which cause a detectable color change in the electrolyte. If combined with an optical sensor, the pH value can be readily evaluated. However, for each of the dyes, the operable pH range is restricted due to their limited sensitivity and stability at the different acidities. Additionally, the respective dyes have to be added to the sample electrolyte; hence, this method is mainly suited for ex situ characterization.297


3.3.7. Applications in FB literature. 
In FB literature, the electrolyte pH value is often estimated by means of a glass electrode150,245,279,284,286,287,292,299–306 that sometimes can be combined with pH metric paper, i.e., organic dyes.147 The electrolyte pH monitoring inside a FB is usually performed via placing probes in the electrolyte tanks and performing either continuous measurement during the complete cycling period, at discrete SOC values, or in between two cycles.95,283,285
Unfortunately, in most publications the information on the pH measurement methodology is either not stated at all95,268,278,280–283,285,288,290,291,307–320 or the sensor type is not specified.110,147,321
Based on the available information, the most appropriate approaches for pH characterization in FBs seem to be glass electrodes and transistor-based methods. Both are readily available and represent commercialized technologies, which can provide precise results in a broad pH range, are chemically stable, and highly sensitive. Compared to glass electrodes, transistor-based sensors are smaller, have faster response times, and are mechanically more robust. Consequently, they are easier to use for monitoring in a laboratory FB. With regard to industrial application, such sensors can be placed in the pipeline before and/or after the flow cell and provide broader information on the electrolyte condition compared to sensors placed in the tanks (where huge pH value gradients might prevail due to insufficient mixing). However, the potential drift of both sensor types requires frequent recalibration, which is a significant issue for online monitoring. Such drawbacks might be overcome by resistance-based sensors in the future.

3.4. Conductivity
The electrical conductivity of an electrolyte, κ, originates from the movement of all ions in it (see eqn (2.36)). With regard to this, for example, the system temperature, the type of solvent, the amount as well as type of supporting electrolytes, the concentration and number of ionic charges of the redox species in all its redox states, the corresponding diffusivities of the ions, and the viscosity of the solution have a significant impact on the electrolyte conductivity. Typical values range from 1 to 39 mS cm−1 in organic solvents (25 °C),242,322–326 from 50 to 560 mS cm−1 (25 °C) in aqueous solvents,105,140,159,194,327–348 and from 0.7 to 25 mS cm−1 (80 °C) in deep eutectic electrolytes.349
A high electrolyte conductivity is desired to lower the ohmic overvoltages within the battery. As a consequence, the conductivity has a crucial effect on the overall battery u, VE, and, subsequently, an impact on EE and EERT. Furthermore, since the ohmic resistance causes heat dissipation during operation, a high conductivity also decreases the effect of the flow cell's self-heating. The electrolyte conductivity also varies with the electrolyte's SOC, due to the oxidation/reduction of redox species and the mass transfer of the supporting electrolyte ions through the membrane. In cases where the conductivity-SOC dependency is known (and calibrated), electrolyte conductivity measurements enable electrolyte SOC determination (see Section 4.1.5).
There is a multitude of setups and methods for conductivity measurements.350 Among the widely used devices which do not alter the electrolyte composition, there are the so-called contact and inductive (contactless) sensors.351 A common feature of both approaches is that every conductance measurement cell has its own cell constant, Kcell. This device-specific value is a proportionality factor which includes influences of the geometric dimensions and arrangement of the electrodes used for the conductivity measurement. In order to obtain the cell constant, every conductometer needs to be calibrated in reference solutions with known specific conductivities or with respect to other conductometers with a known cell constant.352,353 Various calibration techniques can be employed; in general, each of them has its precision limits. These techniques were recently compared in detail by, e.g., Seitz et al.352 Contact sensors are using a two- or four-electrode (two- or four-pole) setup that is immersed in the analyte solution (Fig. 9a and b).351 AC signals are often applied in order to avoid solution electrolysis. In dilute solutions, i.e., in systems with low conductivity, where electrode polarization effects can be neglected, two-electrode contact sensors can be applied. The circuit measures both the total current, I, and the voltage drop, U, between the electrodes. This kind of sensors can be employed in the range of specific conductivities from 10−5 to 102 mS cm−1.351 In order to keep an acceptable precision at higher conductivities, the current applied between the electrodes should be increased. However, this causes additional electrode polarization that can significantly disturb the results of a measurement. In particular for flow battery electrolytes, this interference mainly originates from redox reactions and other electrochemical processes. In such cases four-electrode cells should be used. Here, the current is applied between one pair of electrodes and the voltage is measured between a second pair. This approach mitigates polarization effects and enables the measurement of conductivities higher than 102 mS cm−1 with an acceptable precision.

One should keep in mind that the measurement remains reliable as long as the positions of the electrodes in the cell, their surface, shape, and composition does not change (i.e., the cell constant is a fixed value). Hence corrosive media, electrode fouling, and high flow rates should be avoided in order to not damage the sensor chemically or mechanically. Otherwise, frequent recalibration is required to obtain reliable values.
Inductive sensors (or “toroidal” or “electrodeless”), are usually not in direct contact with the measured solution (Fig. 9c).351,354 The sensor consists of two parallel and closely aligned inductive coils. Wrapped up in a dielectric material that prevents corrosion (e.g., a polymer), the setup is immersed into the solution. On application of an alternating current at the first coil, a magnetic field is generated, which induces a current in the electrolyte. In turn, this current induces another magnetic field that penetrates the second coil and induces a current there, which is measured and used to calculate the electrolyte conductivity.
It should be noted that the sensor's signal can be strongly affected by walls (e.g., the pipeline) and, thus, the sensor should always be positioned at least 30 mm away from solid boundaries.354,355 However, in cases where the position of the sensor remains absolutely constant, a preliminary calibration usually suffices to eliminate such disturbances. As for contact cells, a calibration procedure is always required. Furthermore, the magnetic field resulting from the current flow in the electrolyte solution needs to exceed the sensitivity limits of the receiver sensor. Therefore, inductive conductometers can only be used for the measurement in electrolytes with specific conductivities higher than 0.015 mS cm−1.351,355 Despite that, the absence of a direct contact between the sensor and the electrolyte represents a significant advantage in comparison to two-pole contact conductometers, where even small corrosion or fouling artefacts significantly disturb the results. With regard to that, however, four-pole contact cells are more reliable due to the low currents measured between the voltage-measuring electrodes. Toroidal sensors are resistant to corrosion and any kind of fouling will not significantly disturb the conductivity measurement as long as its inner diameter and inductance is not varying strongly.354
In general, conductivity sensors comprise a probe and a signal analyzing device. Unfortunately, in most cases only the analyzing device is stated without proper information on the utilized probe in the FB literature.194,327,329–331,333–337,339,340,342,343,347–349 Due to this, it can be quite problematic to compare conductivity values from different studies.159,328,348 If one, for example, compares conductivities of compositionally identical VRFB electrolytes, deviations of up to 53% can be found for the reported specific conductivities (see Table 2). In two of the three resources, the kind of probe is not stated and, hence, it is impossible to judge what the cause of the different reported values is and which one is more reliable.
Of course, the required precision of a measurement depends on the specific research task. In some studies, EIS inside a flow cell was employed for conductivity measurements (see Section 3.2.3).332,356 However, a flow cell is prone to changes in the surface characteristics of the carbon felt, membrane fouling, and polarization effects during cycling and, thus, it can be difficult to obtain reliable in situ electrolyte conductivity values without disturbance from other components.
In flow battery research, contact cells for electrolyte conductivity measurements currently prevail.105,194,242,322,324,326–331,333–340,342–346,349 Two-electrode sensors are often applied to investigate electrolytes with conductivities below 102 mS cm−1.242,322,324,326 However, some studies applied such sensors in electrolytes with significantly higher conductivites,338 although four-electrode sensors deliver significantly higher precisions at high conductivities and should be used in such electrolytes. To the best of our knowledge, there are no cases reported when inductive sensors were employed for laboratory applications in FB literature. This might be due to their rather large size (e.g., the Mettler Toledo inductive sensor InPro® 7250 Series has dimensions of 12 cm in length, 4.8 cm in width, and 2.9 cm in height). Furthermore, the device itself is more expensive and readings can strongly depend on the environment of the sensor position. In contrast to other conductometers, which can be calibrated ex situ, inductive conductometers, therefore, require a more complicated in situ calibration. As a consequence, contact sensors are much more comfortable for laboratory applications. In most of the reports, the investigations are performed on small time scales and the sensors can be recalibrated between the readings, even if the surface is fouled or damaged chemically. However, in industrial applications and for continuous in situ monitoring, the stability of an inductive sensor might be more viable, while its large size does not seem critical when industrial tanks and pipelines are considered.
3.5. Viscosity
The simplest definition of the dynamic or absolute viscosity, μ, relies on the intramolecular, frictional forces that counteract the flow of a fluid (see eqn (2.37)). While μ is a scalar constant for isotropic Newtonian fluids, it can also represent a velocity-dependent tensor in more complex cases (e.g., non-Newtonian fluids). In hydrodynamic calculations, it is common to use the kinematic viscosity, υ ≡ μρ−1, where ρ is the density of the fluid. The viscosity changes during FB operation due to the variations in temperature and electrolyte composition (i.e., with changing SOH and SOC (see Sections 4.1 and 4.2)). The electrolyte viscosity has a significant impact on the pumping power and, hence, on VE, EE, EERT, u, and Pmax of the flow battery (see Section 2.4.2). Therefore, the investigation of the viscosity characteristics is highly important for the development of new electrolytes or electrolyte compositions as well as the design and optimization of flow cells for specific electrolytes. The latter is particularly important with respect to non-Newtonian electrolytes, which exhibit specific responses to the different shear stresses within a flow battery system.
The various FB electrolytes reported so far cover a wide range of different viscosity values: aqueous electrolytes range from 1.0 mPa s at 25 °C to 580 mPa s at shear rate 8 s−1 at room temperature,88,90,134,151,152,174,185,189,193,194,219,232,305,314,327,330,331,334–338,348,357–369 non-aqueous electrolytes from 0.4 to 200 mPa s at 25 °C,242,322,324,370–373 aqueous suspensions from 1.0 to 27.0 mPa s at 25 °C,374,375 non-aqueous suspensions at shear rates from 7 to 100 s−1 demonstrate viscosity values from 35 to 10 mPa s or at shear rates from 10 to 100 s−1 from 4000 to 200 mPa s (temperature was not stated),376–386 liquid active substance based electrolytes have viscosities from 23 to 38 mPa s at 40 °C,387 ionic liquids around 73 mPa s at 25 °C,388 eutectics from 33.2 mPa s at 22 °C to 104 mPa s at 25 °C,324,389–391 and slightly diluted eutectics from 3.5 mPa s “at room temperature” to 130 mPa s at 25 °C.324,349,389,392 Many of the electrolytes exhibit non-Newtonian behavior and, as a consequence, it is difficult to compare the impact of these different viscosity values on the battery performance unless the flow rate and geometry are identical. A carefully chosen and thoroughly reported methodology is, therefore, mandatory. In general, the following techniques are frequently applied for viscosity measurements in solutions:

3.5.1. Capillary viscometers and rheometers. 
The most widely known types of such measurement devices are the Ostwald and Ubbelohde viscometers (Fig. 10a). A liquid is forced to pass through capillaries of a defined diameter and length. The time required for the liquid to flow through this capillary is related to the viscosity.393 The force that drives the liquid to flow through the capillary can either be solely gravitational or an externally applied pressure. This method is suitable for the viscosity measurement of Newtonian liquids due to its relatively low costs and simplicity. On the other hand, the density of the liquid of interest needs to be determined and has to stay constant within the range of pressures applied to it. Additionally, it is relatively difficult to manage the magnitude of the force that pushes a liquid through the thin capillary, which makes the method unreliable for the analysis of non-Newtonian liquids.393,394 Furthermore, the geometric characteristics of each capillary needs to be considered by calibration with a liquid of known viscosity and density393 and is essential in order to obtain reliable results. This is true, however, for all methods discussed in this section and calibration constants are usually determined based on similar approaches.
 Fig. 10  Schematic representation of a (a) capillary viscometer, a (b) rotational viscometer, and a (c) vibrating (oscillatory) viscometer.5 


3.5.2. Falling ball. 
A ball with known density and shape (mostly spherical; however, for highly viscous liquids a rod shape is used) is directed to sink vertically through the sample liquid. The time required for the ball to move over a defined distance in the liquid-filled vessel is related to the (dynamic) viscosity. The size of the ball influences the flow distribution and, hence, in order to not disturb the results and keep the movement of the ball vertical, the diameter of the ball is usually chosen to be less than a fifth of the diameter of the vessel.394,395 The equipment for the method is relatively cheap; however, a large volume of the sample liquid is needed. Furthermore, the method has a rather high measurement uncertainty and both the density of the ball and the sample have to be known accurately.393–395 The influence of the setup geometry is again handled via calibration.


3.5.3. Rolling ball. 
In contrast to the falling ball viscometer, the vessel with the sample liquid in the rolling ball viscometer is tilted and the ball rolls along the wall of the vessel. This makes the ball movement trajectory much more reproducible; however, a change in the tilt angle always necessitates a re-calibration. At the same time, the adjustment of the tilting angle enables the management of the effective shear stress and, consequently, enables the accurate analysis of non-Newtonian liquids as well.393–395


3.5.4. Rotational viscometers and rheometers. 
A rotationally symmetric body (e.g., cylinder, conus, plate) is placed inside the sample liquid or in contact with it (Fig. 10b): a precisely controlled torque is delivered to the body and its rotation speed is measured. The liquid slows down the rotation due to its viscosity and, thus, the dynamic viscosity can be calculated. This method is independent of the density of the investigated liquid, but still requires a calibration. A large range of torques and, hence, shear rates can be applied, which enables to measure even highly viscous liquids at a sufficient precision and to investigate the rheology of non-Newtonian liquids.393,394,396


3.5.5. Vibrating (oscillatory). 
A vibrational body is placed into the analyte liquid and the change of its oscillation characteristics by the liquid viscosity is analyzed (Fig. 10c). The resonance frequency, the free vibration decay, and the vibration propagation is measured.394 This approach features fast response times, applicability in online monitoring systems, and a high accuracy. On the other hand, the measurement depends on the density of the sample liquid and has a high vulnerability to changes of the oscillator mass (e.g., due to corrosion or contamination).394,395,397 The variation of the oscillation frequency and the amplitude enable the analysis of the rheological properties of non-Newtonian liquids. The advantages and limitations for investigations of non-Newtonian liquids by both vibrating and rotational techniques are comprehensively discussed, e.g., by T. Mezger.398


3.5.6. Applications in FB literature. 
All aforementioned techniques cover the whole range of viscosity values reported for FB electrolytes so far. However, the capillary and falling (or rolling) ball techniques can only measure viscosities up to 6 Pa s399 and 104 Pa s,400 respectively.
Consequently, all aforementioned methods have been applied to flow battery electrolytes. However, among the reviewed resources, suspension-based electrolytes are solely analyzed by rotational rheometers,374–386 because this method delivers a high accuracy at high viscosities. Furthermore, the presence of solid particles in a sample disturbs the results from the methods that depend on the density of a sample. With regard to this, if a non-rotational viscometer is used for the investigation of suspensions, only kinematic viscosities can be stated. Additionally, suspensions usually are non-Newtonian liquids and rotational rheometers are suited best for the investigation of such systems. There are also examples for the usage of rotational rheometers for the measurement of non-Newtonian viscosities in water-based electrolytes314,366 and in highly viscous deep eutectics324,389,390 for which the type of behavior was not specified. Capillary,90,151,152,174,189,193,194,322,327,334–338,348,365 rolling ball,88,134,359,362,363,367,401 vibrational,232,242,372,388 and falling ball368 viscometers are used for the investigation of relatively low-viscous liquids. However, exceptions exist: some aqueous vanadium electrolytes with nearly 190 mPa s and non-aqueous viologen polymer solutions with 200 mPa s were investigated by capillary viscometers.322,348 Additionally, the viscosity of an ionic liquid-based electrolyte with a value of 73 mPa s was measured by a vibrational rheometer.388 The monitoring of FB electrolytes was performed by discrete ex situ measurements between charge and discharge cycles383 or as a continuous online monitoring for SOC measurement, where the viscosity was assessed from the pressure drop over the porous electrode.88 While the authors of the latter study emphasized a limitation of viscosity measurement methods for in situ monitoring, other not FB related studies demonstrated that the appropriate choice of the viscometer type and its position in the system can provide sufficient measurement accuracies and response times for such purposes.394,396
It can be concluded that electrolytes with viscosities higher than 100 mPa s and with non-Newtonian behavior are more likely to be measured by rotational rheometers due to their precision at high viscosities and due to a higher convenience for shear stress dependent investigations. For Newtonian liquids with viscosities below 100 mPa s any of the other presented methods is suitable; however, the falling ball viscometer seems to be less preferable due to a rather high measurement uncertainty. For online viscometry, the rolling ball and vibrational viscometers represent the best options. Still, it should be kept in mind that vibrational viscometers are, in general, more vulnerable to measurement errors if they chemically interact with the flow battery electrolyte.

3.6. Density
Electrolyte density is the ratio of the sample mass to its volume. Like conductivity and viscosity, ρ is dependent on the temperature (see Section 2.4.2). The density of flow battery electrolytes lies in the range from 1.006 to 1.8 g cm−3 (20 °C) for water-based systems;14,219,232,331,337,338,340,348,357,359,362,363,365,401–403 and from 0.8 to 1.2 g cm−3 for non-aqueous systems including deep eutectic solutions.343,388,389,391,404 It plays a role in the relationship between volumetric and specific/gravimetric electrolyte capacity and, more importantly, it appears in several hydrodynamic equations. Therefore, it is an important parameter for the modelling of FB behavior.405,406 It can be stated in general, that the higher the density of an electrolyte, the higher is its inertia and the higher is the pumping power needed to drive the electrolyte circulation. Therefore, ρ has an influence on battery Pp and, consequently, on EERT. In addition to that, the density is the proportionality factor connecting kinematic and dynamic viscosity values. This is particularly relevant for viscosity measurements, as most viscometers are measuring kinematic viscosities. Due to the compositional changes in the electrolyte upon SOC variations, the density is a SOC-dependent quantity. Hence, it can be used for online SOC monitoring as mentioned for the viscosity and conductivity (see Section 4.1). The following methods for the density determination of liquids are the commonly used ones.

3.6.1. Absolute methods. 
The direct measurement of the volume as well as the mass of a sample represents the most obvious approach for density determination. However, most of the simple methods to determine the mass and the volume of solids and liquids exhibit a very limited accuracy. Nevertheless, if specific devices are applied, absolute methods can achieve the highest accuracy among the existing methods (uncertainties up to 10−5%).407 The widespread application of these accurate approaches is limited due to two reasons: firstly, the equipment is usually far too complicated for most situations and, secondly, it is only suited for solid materials, because the shape of the sample has to remain constant throughout the measurement.


3.6.2. Densimeters based on vibrating bodies. 
This method is based on the determination of the resonance frequency of a hollow cylinder (straight), wire, or tube (varied shape) contacting with a sample solution.408,409 For liquid-density measurements, an uncertainty of as low as 0.1% can be obtained by this approach. However, a previous calibration with a liquid of known density is required.


3.6.3. Buoyancy based. 
If a solid standard sample is weighted in air and, subsequently, in a liquid, where it experiences a buoyancy force counteracting gravity, the difference in the measured weight can be used to calculate its density. Different types of the buoyancy-based density measurement methods include hydrostatic weighting, pressure of flotation, magnetic suspension, and magnetic suspension combined with weighing.407,408 All the approaches are based on the same principle but operate under different pressure and temperature conditions and are suited for distinct density ranges. The uncertainty for this kind of measurements is usually around 0.1%.408


3.6.4. Applications in FB literature. 
In the FB literature, the exact experimental conditions and the applied method for density measurements are often not stated.219,324,331,338,343,391 Furthermore, only the density of solution-based electrolytes were investigated so far, most-likely due to the rather complicated density measurement in suspension-based systems. In half of the reviewed studies detailing the applied technique, an absolute method was applied,232,337,340,348,357,365,403 while for the other half vibrating-body densimeters were chosen.14,359,362,363,388,389,401,402 When comparing the densities of, e.g., similar vanadium electrolytes reported in different studies, the results are in good agreement even if different approaches were used (Table 3). Compared to the other techniques, Vibrating-body densimeters usually possess a slightly higher accuracy (as high as 0.000005 g cm−3). However, it should be noted that the sensor parts, which are brought in contact with the sample, are often made from metal in vibrating body densimeters. Since many FB electrolytes are highly corrosive and absolute methods can provide comparable accuracies (approximately 0.3% difference (Table 3) in direct comparison), absolute methods might be the better choice for this research field. At least, the material-specific limitations should be kept in mind, when choosing the method.

3.7. Temperature
One of the most important parameters for battery operation is the electrolyte temperature, because nearly all physicochemical quantities vary with it. Consequently, all electrochemical processes show strong temperature dependencies. For example, increasing the temperature usually influences the equilibrium potential of a redox couple, its mass transfer parameters, the rate constant of the redox reaction and, thus, can cause a significant reduction of the overvoltages. At the same time, however, it facilitates side reactions, species crossover, and other capacity degradation mechanisms. In turn, the electrolyte temperature itself is dependent on, e.g., the operational parameters (see Section 2.4.2). In terms of the battery technical parameters, T has a significant impact on E, W, VE, CE, EE, Pp, EERT, u, qf, Lcyc, and Lcal. At fixed operational parameters, a higher temperature increases all battery performance characteristics at the expense of a CE decrease, capacity fade facilitation, and a subsequent reduction of Lcyc and Lcal. As a consequence, a detailed knowledge of the impact of the thermal variations on all parameter levels as well as a temperature monitoring and management with help of BMS and the battery periphery is required to ensure a safe and efficient battery operation (see Section 5.2). In the investigations of FB electrolytes, an overall temperature range from −35 to 80 °C was covered so far; however, a stable battery operation is usually reported between −10 and 50 °C. Since a comprehensive review of temperature measurement techniques is provided by Childs et al.,410 we only discuss the most popular sensors in this section.411

3.7.1. Liquid in glass. 
The typical glass thermometer exploits the temperature dependency of a liquid's density to assess the environmental temperature based on the liquid's height in a glass capillary. Mercury-based glass thermometers are the most well-known representatives.
The working range is from −200 to 600 °C and the accuracy varies from 0.005 °C for laboratory thermometers to up to 4 °C in commercial applications.410 The method is cheap, easy to use, and has a basically noise-free signal; however, it delivers slow response times and is a purely analogue measurement. While it is highly suited for basic laboratory investigations of novel electrolytes – in particular due to the chemical resistance of glass – its analogue readout renders it unfeasible for computer-based in situ monitoring. Furthermore, such sensors exhibit a lower accuracy in cases where the glass capillary homogeneity is corrupted or the thermal expansion of the capillary is not properly considered.


3.7.2. Resistance based (thermoresistors and thermistors). 
Several materials exhibit a linear relationship of their electrical resistance with temperature in certain temperature ranges. Among metals, the most reliable material for this purpose is platinum. It is used as a standard for temperature measurement with a working range from −260 to 962 °C and an accuracy ranging from approximately 0.002 °C to 0.007 °C.410 In general the working range of such thermoresistors lies between −260 and 1064 °C. Semiconductors are used for temperature measurements as well. Even though the working principle of semiconductor-based devices is the same, they are specifically called thermistors. Thermistors are easy to fabricate and can be manufactured in bead, disk, rod, washer, and flake form, where forms of bead and disks can reach diameters between 70 and 10 μm.410 However, their accuracy is in the order of 1 °C for commercial applications and 0.01 to 0.05 °C in laboratory studies. These devices work in the range from −100 to 700 °C and their accuracy seems to be suitable for flow battery applications.410 However, in contrast to thermoresistors, thermistors are prone to signal drifts originating from temperature-induced changes in the semiconductor structure and, therefore, necessitate frequent recalibration. All electrical resistance-based sensors deliver a fast response time, digital readouts, and are found in the medium-to-low price segment.


3.7.3. Thermocouple. 
In a system with two contacting first order conductors, a thermal gradient causes an electromotive force (emf). This phenomenon is called Seebeck effect and it is used in thermocouples that are widespread in the field of thermometry. Thermocouples usually work in the range from −270 to 2300 °C with accuracies ranging from 0.5 to 2 °C.410 They are relatively cheap and demonstrate a fast digital response. If thermocouples are working at high temperatures, decalibration can occur because of annealing and subsequent changes in the structure of the sensor alloys. However, the temperature range in FB applications is not expected to cause such problems.


3.7.4. Radiation thermometers. 
In cases, where a measured sample can damage a sensor, non-invasive techniques can be used. Most of them utilize the detection and analysis of electromagnetic radiation emitted or influenced by a sample and are based on the sensing of infrared radiation, optical absorption or emission, scattering, and luminescence. The infrared sensors represent the most widespread variant. Modelling of radiation of a black body enables to assess the temperature in a range between −40 and 2000 °C. On the other hand, the signal is prone to distortion by thermal signals from the sample environment, the medium through which the radiation is transmitted, and the measurement device itself.410 Consequently, the accuracy is rather low: for an infrared sensor, a typical measurement uncertainty is 2 °C, while for other radiative thermometers error values as high as 15% are not uncommon. All radiation-based sensors demonstrate fast response times and are rather expensive in comparison to the aforementioned methods.


3.7.5. Applications in FB literature. 
In most of the temperature studies for flow batteries analyzed for this review, the kind of utilized sensor is not stated or it is unknown but included in the thermostat or utilized commercial heating bath setup.10,14,71,88,151,155,158,185,194,212,327,371,412–438 Literature resources in which the sensor is specified most often utilize thermocouples.64,230,328,439–442 However, a few examples for the application of platinum-based thermoresistors were also found.443,444 The temperature research in FBs is mostly focused on aqueous full-vanadium systems and aims at broadening the stability of the electrolyte under higher temperatures and finding the optimum working temperatures.14,71,88,135,151,155,185,194,230,327,328,416,417,423,425,428,431,434,436,437,440,444 Similar attempts can be found in particular for zinc-based flow batteries212,340,412,415,418–422,426,443,445 as well as other inorganic,427,430,432,433,442 organic aqueous-10,64,414,438 and ionic liquid-based446 electrolytes. Some reports investigate the stability and viable temperatures for Na–K eutectic-based FBs,439 deep eutectic systems,424 sodium–sulfur FBs,435 and FBs utilizing only the concentration gradient of sodium chloride in water.429 Research on organic solvent-based electrolytes is rather emphasizing on the temperature dependencies of kinetic characteristics and solubility investigations of the redox-active substances.371,372
In addition, it should be noted that the sensor position is highly important for the obtained results. In FB studies, sensors have been placed in the electrolyte tanks,230,328,440,442 along the tubing (T-fittings),64 outside the battery (thermostat, or sensor inside an oil or sand bath),9,156,194,212,327,371,412,413,417,418,420,421,423,425,426,428,429,431,432,434,436,437,441,446 and inside an electric heating plate (no flow battery operation included).340 A general judgement about the reliability of temperature measurements in all aforementioned cases is impossible; however, it can be stated that temperature reading is significantly dependent on sensor placement. The data is expected to be more reliable, when the sensor is placed in contact with an electrolyte, e.g., in T-fitting.64 Despite its importance, the topic is insufficiently investigated and, thus, requires further attention.
Based on the comprehensive review by Childs et al.410 and under consideration of the relative costs, the commercial availability, the external disturbance factors, the reproducibility, the accuracy, the response time, and the interesting working range (i.e., −35 to 80 °C), thermocouples, metal-based thermoresistors, and thermistors seem to be the best choice for FB electrolyte monitoring. However, thermistors demonstrate potential drift with time and, hence, are not suited for long-term measurements without frequent re-calibration.

4. Electrolyte state and stability assessment
4.1. State-of-charge measurement & monitoring
The state-of-charge of a flow battery electrolyte usually is defined as the ratio of charge stored in the corresponding electrolyte with respect to its total capacity. This translates to the concentration-based definition, eqn (2.22), given in Table 1. This definition represents the true SOC of a single flow battery electrolyte, SOCE. It should be noted that this definition is rigorously valid only for FB electrolytes where only two redox species are present. While this comprises the vast majority of the state-of-the-art FB electrolytes, more complex definitions need to be applied if reactants with several redox states are utilized. Since QB depends on several factors (e.g., temperature, applied current, individual electrolyte SOCs, etc.) the overall battery state-of-charge, SOCB, as defined in eqn (2.11) (Table 1) usually differs from the SOCE. In particular, SOCB depends on the individual SOCE as well as the capacity QE of each electrolyte and, thus, varies with any imbalance between the both half-cells. This needs to be considered, if individual half-cell SOCs are used for the battery management.
While early approaches for the SOC monitoring relied on the determination of SOCB, most of the stability and performance parameters of a FB depend on the SOC of the individual electrolytes in the half-cells.23,37,43,447,448 As a consequence, finding a reliable method for the measurement and monitoring of SOCE is regarded as one of the key issues for FB commercialization.447,449 In addition to the performance benefits that can be obtained from a proper SOC monitoring,148,175,194 fundamental problems can arise if electrolyte SOCs are not properly monitored as exemplified by the aforementioned report of Reynard and co-workers.25,450 Although the SOCB was monitored in this flow battery installation, the safety issue caused by electrolyte imbalances remained unrecognized since the SOCE values of the half-cells were unknown.
A remarkable number of methods for the SOC estimation of flow batteries and flow battery electrolytes have been reported in the scientific literature, mainly after 2008. The slowly increasing number of articles published per year underlines the increasingly recognized importance of this topic. A comprehensive review of the investigated techniques is provided in the following sections. Furthermore, Table 6 briefly summarizes the different techniques and their key properties.

For some of the model-based state-of-charge monitoring methods a co-estimation of the battery SOH or the battery capacity was reported;484,485,491 usually cannot predict individual electrolyte capacities; the only exception to this introduced two OCV cells, which mitigates one of the main advantages of this method (i.e., no additional hardware requirement).478

Ex situ SOH monitoring methods

More reliable than bulk cycling methods but requires careful experimentation; enables stability assessment on electrolyte level by measurement of electrolyte capacity fade-rates qEf; impact of crossover of redox-active species from non-CLS to the CLS on the measured fade rates is not sufficiently investigated; further accuracy investigations and standardized test protocols are required.15,23,43,455





4.1.1. Coulomb counting. 
A simple, cost-efficient, and technology-independent method for the SOC monitoring is the so-called ampere-hour or coulomb counting.451–454 It relies on the numerical integration of the current, i, passing through the battery over time to determine the amount of charge, ΔQ, transferred between the two half-cells. The SOCB can be calculated with this method by: (4.1)It is assumed that the initial state-of-charge, SOCB0, the total capacity of the battery, QB, and the coulombic efficiency of the redox reaction, CE, are known at any point in time. As a consequence, these parameters have to be determined accurately by other methods beforehand or during battery operation. Despite its advantages, the method is prone to severe error accumulation over time which originates from small inaccuracies in the current measurement, unknown background currents, side-reactions, aging of the battery (i.e., QB changes), and unknown variations in the coulombic efficiency. Due to its unreliability in long-term measurements, coulomb counting should never be used as a stand-alone monitoring method. However, its accuracy and simplicity in short-term measurements makes it highly useful for the in situ and ex situ calibration of other methods.14,198,455 Furthermore, some model-based techniques rely on statistical approaches to reduce the error accumulation of this method (Section 4.1.7).


4.1.2. Titration. 
Potentiometric titration is used as a reliable and accurate method for the measurement of the concentrations of redox-active molecules in solution (see Section 3.1.7). However, with regard to the SOCE determination of RFB electrolytes, it is time-consuming and not suitable for in situ monitoring. Therefore, it is only relevant as ex situ method in research and development. Due to its accuracy, however, it is frequently utilized and accepted as a reliable validation method to evaluate the estimation errors of other techniques.6,160,169,170,230,456–458


4.1.3. Open-circuit voltage. 
One of the most flexible and reliable SOC monitoring techniques are the open-circuit voltage (OCV) methods. Early approaches relied on an additional standard flow cell, which measures the open-circuit voltage between posolyte and negolyte (Fig. 11a, “reference cell”).175,459 The Nernst equation,140 (4.2)is used to calculate SOCB from the equilibrium voltage. This specific equation is only applicable if both electrolytes are balanced in their SOC (i.e., SOCB = SOCEpos = SOCEneg). This assumption can be neglected if the SOC-OCV-dependence is calibrated beforehand by, e.g., using a coulomb counting approach in the first cycle. However, changes in the SOCE of the positive or negative electrolyte due to side reactions and crossover can lead to unpredictable imbalances between the electrolytes during battery operation. While frequent re-calibration can compensate for the resulting SOC estimation errors on the full-cell level, the SOC drift on the half-cell level remains undetectable. Due to the severe safety issues arising from that,25 the measurement of individual equilibrium potentials of the electrolytes versus a standard reference electrode was suggested (Fig. 11a, “auxiliary flow cell”).8,340,458,460,461 This allows for the determination of the individual SOCE and an electrolyte imbalance detection. For this approach, however, the reference potential of the utilized standard reference electrodes needs to be stable and accurately known. Ressel et al. suggested a simple online-calibration method to determine the reference potential, E0ref, during the FB operation (Fig. 11b):14 by combination of the Nernst equation and the coulomb counting approach, the authors demonstrated that a non-linear regression of the experimentally obtained OCV-capacity data to the following theoretical equation results in estimates for the electrolyte capacity, Qth ≡ m−1, for the reference potential, E0ref, and the initial electrolyte state-of-charge, SOCE0: (4.3)However, since reference electrodes are prone to severe reference potential drifts during long-term usage in flow battery electrolytes, a frequent and time-consuming re-calibration is always required. A way to mitigate this problem was presented by Yang et al., who constructed a specific open circuit cell where the reference electrolyte (2.6 M H2SO4) of the utilized hydrogen reference electrode is continuously purged with fresh electrolyte.461 While this effectively suppresses potential drift and might be a viable approach for laboratory applications, the required amount of acid renders it impractical for industrial application. Another method to mitigate reference drift represents the utilization of compositionally symmetric open-circuit cells. In such cells, a portion of the flow battery electrolyte itself in a fixed state-of-charge is employed as a reference electrolyte. With regard to this approach, two investigations were reported: Ngamsai et al. explored a modified open-circuit cell with three half-cells to detect electrolyte imbalances in a VRFB,462 whereas Stolze et al. utilized a compositionally symmetric open-circuit cell with two half-cells for the SOC monitoring of an organic RFB posolyte.455 The equal composition of the monitored FB electrolyte and the reference electrolyte reduces potential drift and enables in situ production of the reference electrolyte during battery operation.455 Furthermore, online re-calibration can be carried out during battery operation by flushing the reference half-cell with fresh reference electrolyte. This approach provides half-cell resolution, reduces the number of re-calibrations, and speeds up the re-calibration process from several hours to a few seconds. However, if reference electrolyte exchange is considered as re-calibration procedure, additional hardware is required. Thus, the overall costs are increased and those additional costs have not been evaluated yet.

4.1.4. Spectroscopy and photometry. 
Various spectroscopic and photometric approaches have been demonstrated for accurate ex situ and/or in situ SOC measurements for different FB electrolytes. In particular for aqueous vanadium electrolytes, absorption spectroscopy at defined wavelengths in the UV/vis spectrum was reported to be straightforward for the negative electrolyte (Fig. 4); however, the approach was initially rejected for the positive vanadium electrolyte due to observations of a non-linear absorbance behaviour.159,161 Geiser et al. demonstrated SOC calibration approaches based on titration and open-circuit voltage, respectively, for UV/vis absorbance measurements.169,170 The authors claimed the feasibility of their approaches for the in situ SOC measurement of concentrated vanadium posolytes and negolytes. However, neither experimental data for an operating VRFB nor an evaluation of the measurement errors have been provided. In contrast to that, Kyung-Hee et al. reported an in situ SOC measurement for concentrated vanadium electrolytes, which relies on the UV/vis absorbance difference measured between the negolyte and posolyte utilizing a special 0.1 mm thick quartz cuvette.171 While the approach enabled the measurement of the negolyte's SOCE, the measurement was again disturbed for the posolyte by the inherent non-linearity of the UV/vis spectra. As a consequence of the complications encountered for positive vanadium electrolytes in UV/vis absorbance measurements, Liu et al. suggested the measurement of full UV/vis transmittance spectra to determine the SOCE of both the positive and the negative vanadium electrolyte.160,162,167,186,463 By establishment of a database of full transmittance spectra at known SOCE, vanadium concentrations, and H2SO4 concentration as well as utilization of a correlation analysis approach, these authors predicted the SOCE, the total concentration of vanadium species, and the concentration of H2SO4 of both electrolytes within an absolute error margin of approximately 2% ex and in situ. Exploiting the non-linearity of the spectra a SOC resolution of 0.002% was achieved in the SOC range above 98% for the positive electrolyte.186 Buckley and co-workers, however, criticized this approach of being prone to calibration errors and for its computational demands.163,164 Instead, these authors performed ex situ investigations of the underlying solution chemistry in the positive vanadium electrolyte, provided evidence for a strongly absorbing 1:1 mixed valence complex V2O33+ (in agreement with Tang et al.161), and derived formulas to predict the excess absorbance of such electrolytes by using a V2O33+ equilibrium model. Based on these findings, the group reported a method to predict SOC calibration curves for absorbance spectra of VFB posolytes over a wide range of total concentrations and for multiple wavelengths.165,166 As a consequence, the authors were able to determine posolyte SOCs with absolute errors of less than 3% by measuring the UV/vis absorbance at two distinct wavelengths. Nevertheless, the total concentration of the vanadium species needs to be known a priori. However, the authors hypothesized that – in contrast to other spectroscopic methods – this concentration can be determined separately from measurements at more than two wavelengths. While most investigations on UV/vis spectroscopy for the SOC monitoring of RFB electrolytes have been reported for aqueous VRFBs, the technique is also applicable to other RFB electrolytes ranging from non-aqueous VRFBs271 over aqueous organic RFBs12,196 to non-aqueous organic242,464,465 electrolytes. For example, Gokoglan et al. observed a less complicated UV/vis absorption spectrum for the vanadium(IV) bis-hydroxyiminodiacetate species compared to its aqueous counterpart and utilized it for SOC measurements.271 Aziz and co-workers revealed that 9,10-anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonic acid forms a quinhydrone dimer that causes significant deviation of the equilibrium voltage expected for a simple two-electron redox reaction. However, the authors also demonstrated that this deviation can be predicted from simple linear combinations of the attenuation values of both pure quinone and pure hydroquinone solutions.12,196 Finally, a different UV/vis absorption approach was presented by Agulio-Aguayo et al. to measure the SOC of iron-based RFBs:466 the formation of a strongly absorbing Fe(II)–1,10-phenanthroline complex provides accurate detectability of the Fe2+ concentration, while additional employment of hydroxylamine for reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ enables the measurement of the total iron concentration. The method was claimed to be independent of pH value, temperature, and total analyte concentration. However, it is only applicable for the ex situ SOC measurement of iron-based RFB electrolytes. Nonetheless, the concept of employing a complexing agent for the generation of an easily detectable species may be beneficial in cases where a nonlinear absorbance behavior of the SOC is observed.
Infrared absorption measurements of a VRFB electrolyte was first reported by Rudolph et al. in 2013.198 The sensor was calibrated with coulomb counting during galvanostatic operation of the VRFB. The authors highlighted an error of below 1% for their SOC measurement. However, this value represented the precision (repeatability) rather than the accuracy of the measurement in terms of true SOC values. In a later study,467 the same group applied this method for the in situ investigation of VRFB electrolyte imbalances and prediction of the equilibrium potential of the electrolyte. A deviation of 4 mV from the measured value was reported in the SOC range from 2% to 98%, which translates to an absolute SOC difference of approximately 4% between the OCV and the IR approach. Duan et al. utilized Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy to investigate the SOC of a symmetric organic-based non-aqueous RFB based on 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (PTIO).197,227 The calibration relied on a linear regression approach based on the Beer–Lambert law to obtain the concentration of the neutral PTIO species from the transmittance of the electrolyte at a specific wavelength. While the authors suggested that the total concentration of the PTIO/PTIO+ couple can be determined by FTIR, the SOC calculation was performed by assuming a constant and a priori known total concentration. The conducted ex situ SOC measurements of electrolyte samples extracted during charging of a symmetric PTIO flow battery were in good agreement with SOC measurements of the same samples based on an ESR approach, which was introduced by Wei et al. earlier.228 Moreover, Jia et al. and Lee et al. demonstrated that in situ SOC measurements are – in principle – also possible via X-ray near-edge absorption spectroscopy (XANES)468 and Raman spectroscopy,199 respectively. Despite their accuracies, however, ESR, XANES, and Raman approaches are unlikely to be implemented in industrial RFBs due to their high costs and comparably complicated measurement setups.
The common advantages of the spectroscopic approaches for SOC monitoring are their general applicability to different types of electrolytes, the high accuracies in the SOC prediction, their half-cell resolution, the wide-spread applicability to different RFB chemistries, and the viable costs for the construction of online-monitoring sensors. Furthermore, approaches like FTIR provide extremely fast measurement times. However, the spectroscopic response of the electrolyte can be complicated by, e.g., complexation and dimerization. A thorough investigation and understanding of the underlying solution chemistry at different concentrations of the analyte is, thus, inevitable. In addition to that, spectroscopic methods usually require a thorough calibration under all possible combinations of electrolyte compositions and temperatures to deliver meaningful results. This is mainly due to the fact that the molar extinction coefficients exhibit a significantly non-linear relationship to the species concentration. As a consequence, both the temperature as well as the total concentrations of the redox couple and the supporting electrolyte need to be determined by additional methods at any point in time during the FB operation; otherwise, the correct calibration data/look-up table cannot be chosen. The only exception to this might be the method of Petchsingh et al., who claimed with reference to a patent application that their method provides means for the determination of the total concentration.166 However, temperature dependencies and the influence of the supporting electrolyte remained unexplored and, therefore, no final conclusion can be drawn. Furthermore, the application of transmittance-based spectroscopy relying on a large calibration dataset might also overcome some of these limitations as highlighted by Liu et al. for VRFB electrolytes.160,162,186


4.1.5. Methods based on material properties. 
Basically, any composition-dependent physicochemical parameter of an electrolyte can be utilized to measure the electrolyte's SOC if the exact relationship is understood and unambiguous. As a consequence, several studies exist that investigated the dependence of the SOC on measurable electrolyte properties (see Section 3) such as the conductivity, the density, the viscosity, the refractive index, and the acoustic attenuation for different RFB chemistries.
Skyllas-Kazacos and co-workers were the first to investigate the dependence of the conductivity of aqueous VRFB electrolytes on the SOCE.105,159 The SOC-dependence of the conductivity is originating from the concentration variation of free ions (i.e., mainly protons for VRFBs) which are transferred between the half-cells during charging/discharging. Empirical equations were reported that predicted the SOC of both the positive electrolyte (R2 = 0.9969) and the negative electrolyte (R2 = 0.9714) in good agreement with the experimental data. Despite these promising results, it was highlighted that a calibration is required for all possible electrolyte compositions and temperatures;105 hence, as for the spectroscopic methods, the changes in the total concentrations of the redox species have to be monitored separately during RFB operation. Due to the downsides of two-pole conductometers discussed in Section 3.4, Ngamsai et al. constructed a four-pole cell device capable of the monitoring of the electrolyte conductivity with sufficient precision for in situ SOC monitoring (Fig. 9b).469 The SOC calibration of the four-pole conductometer was performed utilizing an operating open-circuit cell and the coulomb counting method. However, the SOC prediction accuracy of the approach was not strictly evaluated. Quill et al. used a four-pole cell as well in order to further rationalize the conductivity-based SOC measurement of VRFBs.328 These authors investigated the individual dependence of the posolyte conductivity on each component that varies during VRFB operation (i.e., SOC, total vanadium concentration, total sulphate concentration, and temperature) and established an empirical model for the posolyte conductivity, which exhibited a relative error of ≤1%. While Bolstad et al. mentioned the SOC dependence of the conductivity in zinc–bromine FBs as a side note,470 Zelger et al. systematically investigated their SOC dependence on several physicochemical parameters in alkaline zinc-air RFB electrolytes.340 In both NaOH and KOH supporting electrolytes, a linear relationship between SOCE and the conductivity was observed in a temperature range from 40 to 60 °C with R2 > 0.99. The authors concluded that among the investigated parameters, conductivity is the most suitable SOC indicator for alkaline zinc–air RFBs. Similarly extensive studies were conducted by Milshtein et al. for organic RFBs based on 4-acetamido-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl as a model compound, proving the general viability of the approach for non-aqueous organic RFBs.242 However, they observed a non-linear conductivity-SOCE relationship for a 0.5 M concentration of the redox couple. Despite the promising results, none of the studies demonstrated the approach in an operating RFB.
Furthermore, the relationship of the electrolyte viscosity or density on the SOCE have been investigated as well.242,340,471 However, a consequent application of the viscosity- and density-based SOC prediction for operating flow batteries was only demonstrated for VRFBs by Li et al.9 and Ressel et al.14 so far (Fig. 12). Li et al. utilized Darcy's law for an in situ viscosity determination based on the pressure drop over the cell stack of a 15-cell VRFB (3 kW). Based on a quadratic fit for the calibration data and the indirectly measured viscosity, SOCE prediction for the negative electrolyte was demonstrated to differ by less than 10% from the SOC predicted by an open-circuit cell during one charging cycle. The approach was realized with on-board system sensors that are commonly implemented in any commercial VRFB. As a consequence, the method can be applied without additional hardware and is – in principle – applicable to other RFB chemistries as well. Another SOC estimation approach presented by Ressel et al. relied on the online measurement of the electrolyte density using commercially available density modules.14 After ex situ determination of a temperature correction factor, that was empirically found to be independent of the electrolyte composition, the SOCE–density relationship was calibrated with reference SOCs obtained from an open-circuit cell during the VRFB operation. In six subsequent validation cycles, the density-based SOC estimation revealed RMSDs from the open-circuit cell method of below 4%. However, the authors highlighted that further investigations are necessary to assess the long-term reliability of this method.
 Fig. 12  Experimental data showing (a) the density of the negative electrolyte in an operating VRFB and the corresponding reference SOC value of the electrolyte, which illustrates the electrolyte's SOC dependence,9 (Copyright©2017 Elsevier Ltd). In both cases 1.6 M V+3.5 was utilized in (a) 2 M and (b) 2.6 M H2SO4, respectively. 
Another approach relies on the measurement of the electrolyte's refractive index. Zhang et al. initially introduced this method for positive VRFB electrolytes.457 Using a self-built detector calibrated for different total concentrations of vanadium and the supporting electrolyte, the authors were able to monitor the SOC during VRFB operation. C.-T. Ma et al. proposed an air-gap fiber Fabry–Perot interferometer (AGFFPI) for the measurement of the refractive index, since it is lightweight, corrosion resistant, fast, accurate, and can be easily integrated into RFBs.472 They calibrated the AGFFPI with vanadium electrolytes of known SOC that were obtained by mixing pure V4+ and V5+ solutions. Both the SOC and the temperature dependence of the refractive index were investigated, a linear relationship was observed, and a simple empirical formula was derived. In another study conducted by K. Ma et al., an angular total internal reflection (TIR) sensor was used to determine the valence state of a VRFB electrolyte, which was discharged from VV to VII.473 The authors did, however, not verify their approach using external methods. Although no empirical evaluation of the measurement uncertainty was provided in neither study, the authors estimated an absolute SOC resolution of below 0.01%457,473 and below 0.6%,472 respectively, based on error propagation performed on the empirically derived calibration curve equations. However, this value does not represent the deviation from the true SOC of the sample and, thus, does only represent the precision and not the accuracy of the method. In addition to that, it should be noted that the RI-based methods are not universally applicable: Zelger et al., for example, could not establish a SOC determination based on the refractive index for zinc–air FBs due to the weak dependence of the SOCE from the refractive index in these electrolytes.340
Finally, two reports on SOC measurement methods based on acoustic properties of the electrolyte can be mentioned. Chou et al. reported the utilization of the ultrasonic velocity in VRFB electrolytes to determine the SOCE.456 By employment of a commercial ultrasonic velocity sensor and a titration-based calibration, the authors achieved an accurate in situ SOC measurement for a positive VRFB electrolyte. Measurement of the velocity was fast (4 μs) and accurate within a ±2% error margin in a SOC range from 10 to 90% at constant temperature. On the other hand, Zang et al. recently criticized the utilization of the ultrasonic velocity due to its severe temperature dependence.230 Instead, the authors suggested the utilization of the acoustic attenuation (see eqn (2.40)) which describes the energy loss of a sound wave upon propagation through a medium. In their detailed study, the authors performed ex situ as well as in situ investigations for different electrolyte concentrations and temperatures. Furthermore, they compared SOCE measurements based on sound velocity and acoustic attenuation. Reference SOCE values were obtained by potentiometric titration. In a temperature range from 20 to 39 °C, a negligible temperature-sensitivity of below 1.2% was observed for the attenuation-based SOCE at total vanadium concentrations of 1 to 1.9 M in ex situ experiments. In contrast to that, velocity-based SOCs exhibited a temperature-sensitivity of up to 13.5%. For in situ experiments, absolute SOC errors of below 4.8% were reported for the attenuation-based approach opposed to 22.5% for SOCs obtained via the ultrasonic velocity. The latter value significantly contradicts the maximum error of 2% reported by Chou et al. previously for the same method. Zang et al. explained this by a mismatch between the calibration curve they utilized for the SOCE calculation, which was obtained at a total vanadium concentration of 1.58 M (“benchmark test”), and the online measurement, which was performed at 1.48 M (“in operando validation test”). While it is unclear why the authors compared the in situ accuracies of both methods under distinct conditions, the advantages of their method prevail: it is insensitive to temperature changes, accurate to 5% absolute SOC error, the detector is not in direct contact with the highly corrosive VRFB electrolyte, and despite its moderate measurement-time (≈2 min) it is sufficiently fast for industrial applications. Additionally, low costs were implied; however, a reliable cost calculation was not provided yet.
Most of the physicochemical electrolyte properties investigated for SOC measurements in the scientific literature usually vary with the total redox couple concentration and/or temperature (see Sections 2.4.2 and 3.7). As a consequence, an extensive set of calibration data or comprehensive empirical models have to be obtained for each specific electrolyte under all viable conditions. On the other hand, the universality of these parameters enables the application of such methods to different RFB chemistries. Furthermore, the measurements of these material parameters follow well-known standard procedures (see Section 3) and, thus, cost efficiency can be anticipated in most cases. The reliability of the SOC prediction can most likely be further increased if two or more of these approaches are combined. Among the reported methods based on electrolyte material properties, the acoustic attenuation approach presented by Zang et al. seems to be the most promising technique so far considering its accuracy and temperature independence.230


4.1.6. Amperometry. 
While a few first reports briefly mentioned the utilization of amperometry and steady-state currents in the context of FB electrolytes and SOC detection since 2014,474,475 a consequent exploitation of amperometric methods for the SOC monitoring just started recently. Kroner et al. were the first to demonstrate that RDE measurements and potential step experiments at specific types of electrodes can be utilized to determine the SOCE of VRFB electrolytes.6 An amperometric sensor based on a graphite electrode covered by a porous ceramic gas-diffusion layer (GDL) was constructed (Fig. 13b). The GDL was employed to limit the mass-transfer of redox species from the electrolyte bulk solution to the surface of the electrode by diffusion over the GDL thickness. Upon application of a potential step large enough to reduce the concentration of the redox-active species at the electrode surface to zero, the measured current response yields a steady-state value. The observed current is only limited by the pace at which the molecules are transported to the electrode surface, which is directly related to the concentration of the bulk electrolyte (Fig. 13a). By application of potentiometric titration, Kroner et al. established an empirical calibration curve for the linear relationship between the measured steady-state currents and the samples’ SOCE. With R2 > 0.9761 the general viability of the approach was demonstrated for the positive VRFB electrolytes in ex situ measurements (Fig. 13b).
 Fig. 13  (a) Concentration profile at a working electrode with a porous layer (here: a GDL) having a limited diffusivity for the redox active species. The constant concentration gradient causes a constant (mass-transfer limited) current;6 (b) the linear relationship between the mass-transfer limited current and the concentration of V(IV), which can be utilized to measure the electrolytes SOC (here: the positive electrolyte of a VRFB). The inset depicts the manufacturing process of the diffusion limited process (left to right).8 
Stolze et al. generalized the utilization of mass-transfer limited currents for the SOC determination of various RFB electrolytes at any electrode.10 Based on fundamental equations for mass-transfer limited currents, the SOCEof a RFB electrolyte was correlated to the ratio of cathodic and anodic mass-transfer limited currents, il,c and il,a, according to: (4.4)The first equation is valid for posolytes and the second equation for negolytes. The quantities mO and mR represent the mass-transfer coefficients of the oxidized and reduced redox species, which are dependent on the specific type of mass-transfer limiting process, the type of electrode, and the geometry of the setup. The derived equations were validated for VRFB electrolytes based on the literature data reported by Kroner et al. and own experiments utilizing microelectrodes in aqueous organic RFB electrolytes (i.e., N,N,N-2,2,6,6-heptamethylpiperidinyl-oxy-4-ammonium chloride (TEMPTMA) and ferro-/ferricyanide). Ex situ and in situ experiments at different concentrations and temperatures were performed (Fig. 14). It was empirically demonstrated that the ratio of the mass-transfer coefficients is independent from temperature and electrolyte composition. Furthermore, this ratio can be implicitly obtained during operation or assumed to equal one in a good approximation. For the ex situ samples, the method exhibited absolute RMSDs of 2 to 7% over the complete SOC range in comparison to the known (concentration-based) reference SOCE values. Absolute RMSDs of below 3% over six cycles have been observed during in situ experiments with TEMPTMA, where a symmetric open-circuit cell455 calibrated by the method of Ressel et al.14 delivered the reference SOCE values (Fig. 15). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first and so far only SOC measurement method that does not require external calibration. Furthermore, the approach does not require prior knowledge about the battery capacity, provides half-cell resolution, and exhibits an accuracy that is on par with the state-of-the-art techniques. However, although the authors anticipated low costs for this approach, evidence has yet to be provided for this. In addition to that, the method's long-term reliability needs to be thoroughly investigated as well. It is unclear if the method in its presented form is also applicable in the electrolytes of hybrid flow batteries with, e.g., zinc and lithium half-cells. Due to the well-investigated fundamentals of amperometry,129 however, the approach is expected to be viable for most of the state-of-the-art RFB chemistries, where both the oxidized and reduced species are in solution.

4.1.7. Model-based methods. 
Model-based approaches for the SOCB estimation have been successfully applied for different battery technologies. Based on publication numbers, it is also the second most investigated approach for RFBs after the spectroscopic methods. That is mostly because they usually do not demand additional sensor hardware, since they only rely on operating parameters which are, for operational purposes, monitored anyway. As a consequence, model-based approaches are considered to be particularly cost-efficient. Although most RFB-related models were reported for VRFBs,476–489 the approach mostly relies on generalized battery properties. This enables an application of the model-based approaches to other FB types as well.490–493 Despite its advantages, however, the methods come with a high mathematical complexity and, hence, higher computational demands. Due to this complexity and the multitude of different algorithms that have been applied so far, we will limit our discussion to the general concepts behind the model-based SOC monitoring approaches in this review. Fig. 16 schematically illustrates the common working principle of these methods. In general, a simplified model of the internal state of the FB, which is based on physical laws and/or mathematical considerations, is established. This model takes measurement parameters from hardware sensors (e.g., terminal current, temperature, flow rate, etc.) and specific model parameters (e.g., internal resistances, diffusion coefficients, standard potentials, etc.) as input values and calculates a purely theoretical prediction of a specific battery state variable as the output. This state variable can either be a directly predicted value for the SOC or an estimate for a directly observable variable which depends on the SOC (e.g., terminal voltage, open-circuit voltage, etc.). Due to the necessary model simplifications, the predicted values always come with an unknown error. The statistical uncertainty of the (measured) input variables increases the inaccuracy of the output further. Consequently, usually recursive algorithms are applied that utilize the model prediction and the sensor data to obtain a more accurate estimation of the SOC. These applied algorithms include statistical filters,476–478,481,483,484,487–489,491,493 different types of state observers,480,482,485,486,490,492,493 and machine learning approaches.479 Filters can be thought of as statistical algorithms that aim at improving the accuracy of a noisy measurement value and/or correcting an unpredictable drift of measurement values. For example, Xiong et al. used a coulomb counting measurement in combination with a model-based filter to predict SOCB.477 The most commonly applied filter for RFB SOC prediction is the so-called Kalman filter494,495 and various extensions of it. In contrast to that, state observers have the purpose to predict the SOC from other measurable state variables (e.g., the terminal voltage). To do so, the state observer utilizes the directly measured state variables and the model predictions to fine-tune the internal model parameters until the model predicts correct values (e.g., the correct terminal voltage). Since the model in general describes the internal state of the battery, it can then be used to obtain the SOC from its internal equations. For example, Wei et al. used a state observer to predict the OCV of a VRFB and, subsequently, estimated its SOC from an experimental SOC–OCV calibration curve.480 Among the reported state observers employed for flow batteries are sliding mode observers, H-infinity observers, and model predictive control observers. Machine learning approaches aim at predicting correct output data for a set of input data without knowing or programming the specific underlying relationships between input and output. These algorithms usually need to be trained with a large set of experimental data to enable generalized and correct predictions. Despite the significant interest and success that machine learning approaches have gathered in a multitude of scientific research fields, only Cao et al. reported the utilization of neural networks for the SOC estimation in RFBs so far.479
 Fig. 16  Simplified schematic representation of the fundamental working principle of the model-based SOC estimators for flow batteries. 
With regard to the employed models, lumped-parameter models like the equivalent circuit models (ECM) were utilized for nearly all of the RFB-related studies. The autoregressive exogenous model proposed by Wei et al. represents the only exception to the best of our knowledge.485 While physically correct models of FBs are based on fundamental physical laws, which are usually described by complex systems of coupled partial differential equations, ECMs describe the internal electrochemical processes within the FB by using standard electrical components such as resistors, capacitors, current sources, and voltage sources. The concept is well-known from the EIS technique (see Section 3.2.3). ECMs are often sufficiently accurate in capturing the most important internal processes of the RFB and come with comparably low computational costs. While the exact ECMs differ between the studies, two general groups can be identified: the first group uses an ECM with fixed and a priori optimized model parameters,476–478,482,483 while the second group applies additional algorithms that continuously adapt the model parameters to account for operation-related variations (e.g., aging).480,481,484–487,490–493 The adaptive algorithms often provide better convergence, higher robustness against erroneous initialization or cell imbalances, and improved accuracy. Regardless of the applied ECM, the model-based methods are usually highly accurate for the prediction of the SOCB. The maximum error reported among the reviewed model-based approaches is 5.5%.477 Typical error values remain within a 2% error margin (after the specific convergence time) with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) well below 1%.481,485,487,491–493 Despite that, it has to be pointed out, however, that none of the reported methods provides individual SOCE values of the half-cell electrolytes, which bears the aforementioned risks for system failure. The study of Yu et al. might be regarded as the only exception to this statement.478 However, they utilized additional OCV cells to predict half-cell related concentration values and it is, thus, questionable if this approach has significant benefits in comparison to standard OCV approaches without additional models (see Section 4.1.3).
Some of the algorithms were able to predict not only the SOCB but also the concentration imbalances, the crossover flux, and the attainable battery capacity.481,482,484,485,490–493 Although a few studies have included thermal-dependent ECMs,477,482,488 all model-based SOC estimators (except for one477) have only been tested under room temperature and isothermal conditions. With regard to this, some authors have explicitly highlighted this lack of temperature validations for their approaches and postponed this to (not yet published) future studies.480,481,486,489 Temperature, therefore, remains an insufficiently investigated factor for the accuracy and robustness of the model-based approaches. In the same context it needs to be highlighted that nearly all of the reported state observers predict an accurate estimate of the OCV and, subsequently, estimate the SOC from experimentally obtained OCV–SOC curves. As a consequence, these approaches are prone to temperature fluctuations and calibration errors to the same degree as conventional hardware-based open-circuit cell methods. In addition to that, these approaches still require an extensive set of calibration curves for all viable electrolyte compositions and temperatures.

4.2. State-of-health and capacity measurement
Up until now, all literature-known FB chemistries exhibit a significant capacity fade over time.113,448,449,496 Some of the main contributions to this capacity loss originate from changes in the chemical composition of at least one of both electrolytes. Since these processes usually occur to a different extend in the positive and negative electrolyte, the half-cells get out of balance over time.497 These electrolyte imbalances may have several causes, which can be generally distinguished as:
• side reactions requiring a faradaic electron transfer (e.g., the electrolysis of the solvent, electrochemical degradation of electrode materials upon current flow, etc.);
• side reactions requiring no faradaic electron transfer (e.g., depletion of the redox-active material by molecular degradation mechanisms as well as by chemical interactions with the solvent, the supporting electrolyte, or the cell components (see Section 2.1), transfer to an inaccessible oxidation state);
• precipitation of the redox couple or the supporting electrolyte due to variations in, e.g., electrolyte temperature or pH value;
• crossover of active species through the membrane;
• volumetric (solvent) transfer trough the membrane;
• electrolyte leakages.
Except for the prevailing attempts to find new redox couples, the different properties of the existing FB types have induced different (passive) mitigation strategies (e.g., the investigation of membrane materials as well as the chemical modification of the redox-active substances to suppress reactant crossover) and (active) capacity recovery strategies (e.g., electrolyte rebalancing or exchange). Section 5.1 provides a detailed discussion on such strategies. However, all of these strategies require a proper understanding of the origins of battery degradation mechanism as well as a thorough ex situ and in situ assessment of the capacity fade of each individual electrolyte. Both is important either to apply a suitable strategy or to evaluate a strategy's usefulness in increasing the FB's lifetime. In this context, the battery state-of-health, SOHB, and the electrolyte state-of-health, SOHE, represent valuable parameters (see Table 1). The SOHB provides information on the ability of a flow battery to access a fraction of its nominal capacity, Qn. Usually, the Qn of the first cycle is used as this reference value. In this definition, however, the SOH is dependent on the exact conditions under which the battery is operated (see Section 2.4.2). As a consequence, it is impossible to assess whether a capacity decay or SOH decrease originates from, e.g., chemical decay of the electrolytes, crossover, electrode degradation, or membrane degradation on the full cell level.11,15,498 In contrast to that, the concentration-based definition of the SOHE, eqn (2.21), is independent of any variations in the operational parameters. Furthermore, processes like crossover manifest themselves directly in the concentration values and can be distinguished easier if the SOHE of both electrolytes is measured. If combined with the definition of the electrolyte capacity (see Section 2.4.1), the SOHE can also be expressed in terms of electrolyte capacities rather than concentrations. Consequently, the SOHE can be experimentally evaluated if the initial and current electrolyte capacities are known. The assessment of SOHE rather than SOHB can provide fundamental information on the amount and type of capacity fade. In addition to that, it is a more reliable parameter for FB monitoring and its operational optimization. However, the SOHE (or equivalent quantities) are only sparsely encountered as a figure of merit in literature, which is probably partly due to the unawareness about methods for the SOH assessment and/or the current development state of existing methods. Thus, we provide an overview about techniques for this purpose in this section. In principle, all techniques for the chemical analysis capable of measuring and differentiating redox species’ concentrations (see Section 3.1) can be employed for the measurement of the electrolyte capacity, reactant concentrations, and the electrolyte SOH. Most of the available methods for this purpose are related to the known SOCE measurement methods (Section 4.1). They can, thus, be subdivided in similar categories:
Redox titration is commonly employed to assess the concentration (and capacity) of a FB electrolyte in ex situ approaches.6,160,168,169,345,359 For aqueous VRFB electrolytes it was reported to be accurate within ±5%.159 In connection with the open-circuit voltage methods, Ressel et al. reported a simple method which co-estimates the SOCE and the QE from the open-circuit potential of the flow battery electrolyte versus a standard reference electrode based on a fitting approach (see eqn (4.3)).14 A fraction of the potential–time curve in a galvanostatic experiment sufficed to obtain an estimate for the electrolyte capacity in a VRFB. Stolze et al. successfully applied this approach for the investigation of a compositionally symmetric open-circuit cell and an aqueous organic RFB electrolyte as well,455 which infers the method's applicability to a wide range of FB chemistries. In a follow-up study conducted by the group of Struckmann, this approach was then used for the estimation of the electrolyte SOH of a VRFB.499 Although the authors highlight low errors in their study, the initial capacity estimates exhibited more than 8% deviation from the expected value of 4.3 A h (based on given volumes and concentrations). Furthermore, the accuracies of the estimated SOH values obtained during subsequent online monitoring remained unvalidated for the OCV method, since no established and independent SOH measurement method was utilized for comparison. Spectroscopic and photometric methods can be used to measure the total concentration and capacity of the flow battery electrolyte as well (see Section 3.1). Despite that, this is possible only under restricted conditions, unless the electrolyte represents a diluted solution or ultrathin cuvettes are used so that linear absorption laws apply.12 In any case, the molar extinction coefficient has to be known in the concentration range of interest taking into account temperature dependencies and the electrolyte SOC. This is usually achieved by calibration. The determination of electrolyte capacities is usually performed at the extreme SOCE (0% and 100%). However, it is not impossible to determine the total concentrations at an intermediate SOCE,12 if the SOCE is obtained by other techniques and the specific solution chemistry is well understood.166 The in situ determination of total concentrations/electrolyte capacities was either empirically demonstrated or at least theoretically rationalized in several studies;12,162,166,180,271 however, mixed results were obtained with respect to the measurement accuracies. The exact electrolyte conditions always need to be considered before application of the approaches. Non-optical spectroscopy methods like the ESR spectroscopy197,228 were also applied for the ex situ measurement of reactant concentrations. However, in the case of ESR, usually only one of the redox species can be detected and, hence, the SOCE needs to be known via other methods in order to calculate the electrolyte capacity. Methods based on material properties such as density and viscosity have not been explicitly applied for the measurement of total concentrations in flow battery electrolytes to the best of our knowledge. The only exception represents the recent study of Struckmann et al., who presented a SOH estimation based on density measurements.499 A SOH–density relationship was calibrated with the SOH estimates obtained by the OCV method. The authors highlight low deviations from the OCV method (i.e., low calibration errors). These, however, are not suitable for the accuracy validation of the method, as the SOH values obtained by the OCV method have not been independently verified either. The verification of both methods is, consequently, pending. Despite that, the results of this study indicate the general applicability of such approaches. Since other material property based SOC measurement techniques also rely on calibration approaches and concentration dependencies were already reported in the context of SOC monitoring,159,328,340,457 no fundamental obstacles are currently inferred for development of similar SOH estimation methods. The employment of material property-based methods for the electrolyte capacity and SOHE measurement can, therefore, be expected for the future. A similar early research status is encountered for amperometric methods: the approaches utilized for the SOCE estimation6,10,475 can be easily exploited for concentration measurements, if a proper calibration is performed. Lee et al. demonstrated this for zinc-based FBs using Pt-microelectrodes for the measurement of zinc halide concentrations.500 Recently, Kowalsky et al. reported the utilization of microelectrodes for the assessment of the SOHE for diluted non-aqueous organic flow battery electrolytes (<25 mM).501 It is similarly possible to determine concentrations with nearly all electrochemical methods, if the electrode surface area, the diffusion coefficients, the reaction rate constants, the reaction schemes, and similar parameters are known or handled by calibration approaches. Despite that, general issues with in situ monitoring arise from temperature variations, variations of the diffusion coefficients, and variations of the kinetic rate constants. Furthermore, surface modifications during long-term operation can change the electrode surface area in unpredictable ways. Most of these issues can be mitigated in ex situ experiments and, e.g., cyclic voltammetry has been already applied for the stability analysis of FB electrolytes albeit with rather high measurement uncertainty.15 In addition to that, RDE experiments represent a valuable tool for the characterization of rate constants and diffusion coefficients in RFB electrolytes229,263,502 and, in turn, can be easily applied to determine concentrations if the diffusion coefficients and rate constants are known. Although associated with high costs (≈10000$), the application of RDE-based methods in this context was reported for iron- and VRFBs, respectively.14,503 Despite the notably low absolute concentration errors (<3 mM) of these approaches, the accuracy of electrochemical methods is in general questioned in particular for the stability assessment at low to extremely low capacity fade rates.15,43 This indicates a need for further methodologic investigations to clarify the suitability of electrochemical methods for long-term observations. Several model-based approaches used for the SOCB monitoring were also designed to co-estimate the SOHB or the battery capacity.484,485,491 They do not necessitate additional hardware and provide in situ measurement data. However, they can usually not predict individual electrolyte capacities. The only exception was the study by Yu et al.,478 who applied two open-circuit cells to obtain vanadium concentrations in both half-cells of an VRFB in combination with an extended Kalman filter. However, the OCV cells alone would have been capable of this without the model-based approach as discussed previously.
Other electrochemical methods for the estimation of individual QE and SOHE values are galvanostatic and potentiostatic cycling experiments in bulk electrolysis cells11 or in unbalanced, compositionally symmetric flow cells.15,23,43,271 The latter is currently frequently recommended as the replacement for the rather ambiguous, galvanostatic full cell cycling experiments to assess the stability and lifetime of FB electrolytes.
4.3. Stability and lifetime assessment
The stability of vanadium electrolytes was investigated in several studies11,181,448,504–507 and the lifetime assessment of other FB electrolytes has been performed or already surveyed by others.37,43,508 The most recent of the reviews,43 solely takes into account reports on aqueous RFBs. However, most of the highlighted methodology and drawn conclusions are not necessarily limited to this FB type.23,241 From the previous literature surveys, the following categorization of the methods for the lifetime assessment of FBs can be derived (Fig. 17):
 Fig. 17  Examples for all three types of stability assessment experiments: (a) ex situ approaches here exemplified by the utilization of electrolysis cells to determine the cycle based and time-based capacity fade rate of 0.001 M 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)benzene (DBBB) in 1 M LiTFSI in PC;11 (b) in situ/online determination of time-based electrolyte capacity fade rates in a compositionally symmetric unbalanced flow cell for a quinone based aqueous organic electrolyte at different SOCs.15 (c) full cell cycling for the measurement of time-based capacity fade rates of an operating unbalanced aqueous organic flow battery based on 3,3′-(9,10-anthraquinone-diyl)bis(3-methylbutanoic acid) as the negative electrolyte and 0.4 M ferri-/ferrocyanide as the positive electrolyte (both at pH = 12).20 (Copyright©2020 Elsevier Inc.) 
• Ex situ/offline analysis of chemical degradation mechanisms in individual electrolytes by, e.g., bulk electrolysis in electrolysis cells, NMR and UV/vis spectroscopy as well as mass spectrometry under distinct conditions (i.e., different SOCs, temperatures, concentrations, pH values, etc.)
• In situ/online electrochemical analysis of individual electrolytes in full cells by utilization of additional sensors (e.g., UV/vis or infrared spectroscopy) or in compositionally symmetric, unbalanced flow batteries, where the same electrolyte is utilized in both half-cells at an initial SOC of 50% and a capacity limiting side (CLS) is established by an unbalanced electrolyte volume ratio.
• Full cell electrochemical analysis, where the capacity fade of the whole flow battery (not the individual electrolytes) is measured by galvanostatic or potentiostatic cycling (usually with distinct posolyte and negolyte chemistries).
So far, the vast majority of studies utilized galvanostatic charge–discharge cycling in the full cell configurations to obtain cycle-based capacity fade rates. Cycle-based fade rates and full cell investigations, however, are now considered to be misleading for the measurement of ΔqBf.11,15,43 Consequently, the lifetime assessment by time-based capacity fade rates has been recently proposed as a more reliable figure of merit.11,23,43 Furthermore, it was suggested to evaluate ΔqEf by potentiostatic cycling in compositionally symmetric, unbalanced flow cells (Fig. 5). This methodology provides more reliable capacity fade rate values than full cell experiments,15,23 because it mitigates effects such as cross-contamination by reactant crossover as well as apparent capacity losses caused by temperature and overpotential variations (e.g., by altered mass-transport or varying electrolyte/membrane resistivity). Although we agree with the recommendation to extend the application of this specific method to other molecule classes (and flow battery types),43 we would like to emphasize the following: despite its significant advantages in comparison to full cell cycling, the unbalanced compositionally symmetric flow cell tests necessitate extremely careful experimentation in order not to introduce unwanted systematic errors. The method was carefully evaluated with regard to some of its advantages and disadvantages by Goulet and Aziz.15 Furthermore, the danger for crossover and the need for further improvements of this method was mentioned in a recent viewpoint.23 In addition, we would like to highlight some of the specific pitfalls we currently see for the method, that have not been investigated to the best of our knowledge so far. Before the discussion of these pitfalls, however, one needs to be aware that crossover is strictly eliminated in unbalanced, compositionally symmetric flow cells only if (at least) the following ideal conditions prevail during the complete experiment:15,23
• The electrolytes in the CLS and the non-CLS are at a (temporal) average SOC of exactly 50% during each charge–discharge cycle;
• Both electrolytes have the exact same concentration of the redox-active species throughout the complete experiment;
• Hydrodynamic and osmotic pressures are identical on both sides of the membrane (i.e., no pressure gradients are evident across the membrane);
• Electrolyte leakage and solvent evaporation are fully negligible in both half-cells.
Static cell tests might mitigate issues with pressure gradients and electrolyte leakage;15 however, they intensify possible crossover artefacts, introduce severe mass-transport limitations, and complicate the complementary ex situ chemical analysis. While pressure gradients, electrolyte leakage, and solvent evaporation can (and should) be monitored, it must be stressed that even the smallest sources of capacity losses (e.g., droplets on the reservoir walls15) need to be considered for the stability assessment. In addition to these technical issues, the other concerns represent more fundamental issues: the most reliable SOC measurement methods available to date provide absolute precisions of around 2 to 5% SOC (see Section 4.1). Thus, it is highly difficult to exactly fulfil the 50% SOC condition already at the beginning of the experiment. Deviation from the (average) SOC of 50% on either side of the symmetric flow cell during cycling, theoretically causes several net driving forces for solvent and species crossover between both half-cells:
• Osmotic pressure gradients due to imbalanced supporting electrolyte concentrations;
• pressure gradients due to SOC dependent variations of electrolyte viscosity and density;
• electric potential gradients due to imbalanced average equilibrium voltages;
• chemical gradients due to imbalanced average concentrations of any redox species, even though the total concentration might be equal in both half-cells.
Even if SOCs of 50% could be ideally prepared and, hence, would represent the true initial state of the experiment, they cannot prevail during the complete capacity fade experiment. It is the very nature of capacity fade experiments, that they involve significant changes in the electrolyte concentration/capacity in (at least) the CLS. The latter must, subsequently, cause a drift of the average SOC in the non-CLS away from 50% to counterbalance the capacity loss in the CLS. This, subsequently, induces crossover. The existence of this issue can be inferred from the results of at least the following two studies:
• Goulet and Aziz reported transient phenomena in the capacity measurement during cycle–pause–cycle experiments at different SOCs of the CLS (0%, 50%, 100%) leading to apparent variations in the measured capacity.15
• Stolze et al. observed a significant reference potential drift in an unbalanced, compositionally symmetric flow cell that was used as an OCV cell. This drift was demonstrated to be due to SOC changes in the CLS (i.e., the reference half-cell of the symmetric OCV cell) of approximately 0.2% to 1% SOC per day, which evidently did not originate from chemical decomposition in the CLS electrolyte and, hence, can be ascribed to the aforementioned gradients.455
While the non-CLS electrolyte volume may be chosen large enough to reduce SOC imbalances to a negligible level, an establishment of imbalances in the total concentrations as well as the other aforementioned gradients remains fundamentally inevitable. In the worst case, such imbalances could lead to a continuous replacement of decayed redox molecules in the CLS by reactant crossover from the non-CLS, which would result in an apparently lower capacity fade rate. The large time scales, on which long-term stability investigations of electrolytes with a low or extremely low capacity fade rate have to be performed, might additionally facilitate significant manifestation of such misleading effects even for small driving forces. The utilization of several membrane layers instead of a single membrane15 might at least partly mitigate these issues; however it cannot prevent them fully. While the qualitative existence of such effects can be rationalized from basic electrochemistry and the two studies mentioned above,15,455 their quantitative impact on the measurement of capacity fade rates in compositionally symmetric, unbalanced flow cells requires a thorough investigation. All the aforementioned measurement issues are most-likely negligible for electrolytes with moderate capacity fade rates (≥0.1% d−1), but they might lead to wrong results at low(0.1 to 0.02% d−1) and extremely low (≤0.02% d−1) fade rates. The latter, however, represent the most interesting values for future FB applications and are the fade rates this method was developed for.15,23 With regard to this, the establishment of standardized measurement protocols, which are based on thoroughly investigated methods is reasonable. This was already recommended by others11,508 and first endeavors are becoming visible in literature with respect to the discussed symmetric flow cells.23,227 However, we believe that ex situ SOC and SOH measurements (see Sections 4.1 and 4.2) for the stability investigations of isolated electrolyte aliquots at distinct electrolyte conditions (i.e., temperature, SOC, total concentration, oxygen levels, etc.) deserve far more attention in this context. Such ex situ experiments can fully exclude crossover and other disturbing effects related to FB operation. The combination of in situ and ex situ (electro-) chemical analysis has already proven to be valuable in unravelling capacity fade mechanisms.43 Thus, combination of ex situ methods with, e.g., symmetric or full cell cycling has a significant potential to provide a highly reliable stability assessment. Some ex situ approaches for this purpose already exist (see Section 4.2), but their further development and the investigation of novel methods is required to improve stability assessment and FB electrolyte characterization in general.
We would like to emphasize again that within the scope of this review we focused on the stability and lifetime assessment of electrolytes only. As highlighted in Section 3, however, other flow battery components (e.g., membranes, electrodes, etc.) can affect the battery lifetime significantly as well and should be taken into account for a detailed battery lifetime analysis.
5. Online monitoring and battery management systems
In this section, we discuss the performance optimization of flow batteries based on the electrolyte characterization methods and state variables reviewed in Sections 3 and 4. Firstly, we review the reported approaches for the capacity recovery, which aim to improve the lifetime of a FB system. We will then discuss its performance optimization based on different operation strategies and the automated implementation of these measures in a BMS.
5.1. Capacity recovery approaches
As discussed in Section 4.2, a RFB usually exhibits capacity fade during long-term operation, which limits the battery's lifetime. This net capacity loss is caused by multiple processes, among which some can be mitigated by adequate strategies.509–511 The respective causes can generally be classified in reversible and irreversible processes. While the overall effect on the battery performance caused by reversible processes, such as solvent crossover, can be mitigated using proper rebalancing methods, the impact of irreversible processes can only be handled by electrolyte (and component) exchange. Furthermore, imbalances occurring as a result of reversible processes are classified as SOC imbalances, which can be further divided into faradaic imbalances (unequally affecting both half cells) and stoichiometric imbalances (in this review used for equally imbalanced half-cells), and volumetric imbalances.497
Several publications focus on the detection of electrolyte imbalances and a better understanding of its driving forces. Basic research has been conducted on, e.g., ion migration processes and faradaic losses in VRFBs509,511–513 and the stability assessment of organic RFB materials (see Section 4.3).15,148,514 Most of the presented methods for imbalance determination are based on techniques used for the electrolyte SOC determination (see Section 4.1),159,168,173,457,462,484,485,515 although others have been reported as well.516 The research on passive imbalance mitigation strategies is focused on membrane improvements,517–526 electrode modifications,527,528 changes in electrolyte composition and volume,179,188,514,529–532 use of inert gas atmospheres,173,525,533 SOC restrictions,534 and stack shut-offs.535 While these changes to the overall system are made in order to prevent or to slow down imbalance development, rebalancing strategies are applied to actively reverse the electrolyte imbalance of the system. These rebalancing strategies include electrochemical as well as chemical techniques to address faradaic imbalances and electrolyte mixing procedures for stoichiometric as well as volumetric imbalances (Fig. 18).497 Currently, the VRFB is the most well-investigated system in terms of both passive and active imbalance mitigation strategies.447
 Fig. 18  Schematic representation of rebalancing strategies for symmetric cell chemistries used in the VRFB. While stoichiometric and volumetric imbalances can be managed by mixing strategies, faradaic imbalances can only be properly readjusted by (electro-) chemical measures. 
Electrochemical methods for the mitigation of faradaic imbalances commonly require additional hardware. This includes an additional electrochemical cell as well as, e.g., pipes, valves, pumps, sensors, wiring, and electronics. The general idea of the electrochemical capacity recovery techniques is the utilization of an additional electrochemical reaction counterbalancing the redox reaction required to rebalance posolyte and negolyte SOCs and capacities. This may be achieved by using sacrificial reactions such as solvent electrolysis or by using cheap, ready-to-use redox-active materials (e.g., hydrogen) in an additional half-cell. However, both methods inevitably lead to a contamination of the electrolyte with electrolysis products, which may cause problems in both non-aqueous and aqueous solvents. In the case of water, e.g., these products may influence the electrolytes’ pH values. Thus, solvent electrolysis is employed only in systems requiring extreme pH values anyway (e.g., VRFBs or iron/chromium systems). For such systems, a small change in the proton concentration caused by electrolysis does not have a significant impact on the overall system pH value. The application of electrochemical solvent oxidation for rebalancing purposes only requires the addition of small amounts of water (VRFB) or hydrogen chloride (Fe/Cr-RFB).536,537 In general, a reduction of the average redox state of the electrolyte requires solvent oxidation as counter-balancing reaction (e.g., in the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for water),450,537–540 whereas an increase of its average redox state requires a solvent reduction as counterbalancing half-cell (e.g., the reduction of protons in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)).450,538,539 Literature about electrochemical rebalancing strategies features cells with and without solvent electrolysis. Thaller reported a rebalancing cell for an Fe/Cr RFB, using hydrogen either supplied from a separate tank or from the negative half-cell, in which hydrogen is produced in a side-reaction during the charging of the RFB.541 Mainly due to the contamination of the electrolytes with the platinum-based catalyst used for hydrogen activation, the system was later replaced by an electrolysis cell generating chlorine from the hydrochloric acid electrolyte.537 Further studies on rebalancing cells for the Fe/Cr system can be found as well.540,542 Similar cells were proposed for the VRFB: Rudolph et al. used a special water electrolysis cell for the rebalancing.467 The authors showed that either VIII or VV ions can be used for electrochemical reduction using the OER. The system was able to restore the full operation capacity of the VRFB in both cases. Peljo et al. introduced the ‘dual-circuit RFB’, which was designed to combine the electrochemical storage of a VRFB with the generation of hydrogen and oxygen from the electrolytes, enabling faradaic imbalance mitigation as well.450,538,539 Furthermore, Whitehead and Harrer proposed a cell consuming the hydrogen generated at the negative electrode during charging.534 Another approach to mitigate faradaic imbalances is based on chemical techniques, where additives readily undergoing redox reactions are introduced into the respective electrolyte. For this purpose, simple organic and inorganic compounds, such as oxalic and formic acid, methanol and ethanol or sulphur dioxide and hydrazine are suitable, since they often produce gaseous reaction products and do not introduce foreign cations into the electrolyte. Although chemicals for changes in the redox state of the active materials in the electrolytes have mostly been proposed for the initial electrolyte preparation, the underlying redox reactions can as well be used for electrolyte rebalancing. Approaches using chemical compounds are especially well-studied for VRFBs.105,211,539,543,544 Aziz and co-workers have recently reported that gasses like oxygen in the air can be used for this purpose in aqueous organic RFBs as well.148 During their study of the organic active material DHAQ, the occurring disproportionation to an anthrone derivate was reversed by re-oxidation using molecular oxygen, before the occurrence of irreversible deactivation by dimerization. The authors were able to demonstrate a recovery of approximately 70% of the initially lost capacity.
The so-called electrolyte mixing allows the rebalancing of stoichiometric and volumetric imbalances: the electrolyte volumes of the two imbalanced half-cells are (partially) combined to rebalance their SOCs and capacities. However, it is only applicable in so-called symmetric FBs, where the same electrolyte is used in both half-cells. This includes vanadium and Fe/Cr systems.545 However, other symmetric cell chemistries may be equally suitable,546,547 although rebalancing methods were not investigated for these so far. The method is well-suited for stoichiometrically imbalanced electrolytes as caused by reactant crossover through the membrane. It is noteworthy that the method cannot completely restore capacity losses caused by faradaic imbalances.105,447,512 The redox reactions taking place upon mixing may furthermore release energy in form of heat which can affect the electrolyte stability.535 However, since this rebalancing method is relatively easy to implement, it is a commonly applied technique. The approach is particularly well-studied for VRFBs, in which ion crossover through the membrane accounts for a large share of the capacity fade.168,484,509–512,525,548 In 2013, Luo et al. investigated the performance losses of a VRFB using a mixing strategy for electrolyte rebalancing amongst others.510 Roznyatovskaya et al. proposed an electrolyte mixing strategy for restoring the full capacity of an electrolyte using an additional volume of electrolyte combined with a charging protocol.168 Nevertheless, this approach still has to deal with the portion of the vanadium electrolyte not introduced into the RFB, which has to be recycled. Wang et al. proposed an electrolyte re-flow technique using a hydraulic shunt between the tanks and demonstrated significant performance improvements for long-term cycling.549
In large-scale VRFBs, rebalancing strategies have to be combined in order to reverse electrolyte imbalances and achieve almost indefinite usability of the electrolytes.548 This was exemplified by Li et al., who developed a rebalancing protocol based on electrolyte mixing in combination with an electrochemical rebalancing cell in order to autonomously rebalance the electrolytes.536 On a one kW scale, Bhattarai et al. demonstrated an automatic rebalancing based on electrolyte mixing without including an electrochemical rebalancing system.525,550 The investigated FB lost approximately a third of its capacity over 25 cycles without rebalancing compared to a stable performance over 250 cycles with automatic rebalancing.
Finally, the partial or complete replacement of degraded FB electrolyte represents another approach for the capacity recovery in all FB types. Similarly, an addition of fresh redox-active material to the already used electrolyte may be possible. Such approaches are predicted to be feasible in particular for cost-efficient aqueous organic electrolytes.23,43
5.2. Operation strategies
Based on the general interconnections between operational parameters, physicochemical electrolyte parameters, and the technical parameters of a battery, a range of operation strategies can be applied in FBs. Such operation strategies can involve the control of flow rates,4,13,48,121–123,125,128,130,131,135,551,552 current loads,13,121,123,128,131,551–553 voltage loads, and electrolyte temperature13,122,123,135,551,552 in order to maximize EE, EERT, and u. Further purposes of these variations are the achievement of, e.g., passive temperature management (i.e., without a heat exchanger)122,123,135 and electrolyte stability optimizations.122,123,134,135,509,552 Most of the strategies presented in this section utilize the SOC as an underlying control parameter or indicator to adjust the operational parameters in a beneficial way (Section 4.1). Unfortunately, in most of the studies reviewed in this section, it was not explicitly specified if the SOCB or SOCE was utilized.
As pointed out in Section 2.4.2, the flow rate has a significant impact on the mass transfer as well as the pumps’ power consumption and, hence, on the values of WSU, ∑η, and VE. Consequently, an appropriate flow rate management can be beneficial for the optimization of EERT and u. While a constant flow rate does not represent an optimal strategy for FB operation, an increase of the flow rate near the minimum and maximum SOCs, for example, mitigates losses in VE and u.48 In the literature devoted to the optimization of pump work in FBs, the flow rate is often expressed by the flow factor ffl (see eqn (2.31)). Among the compared strategies, there are constant vfl,121 stepwise increase of vfl,121 exponential dependence of vfl on (SOCE)−1,48 a constant ffl strategy (sharp hyperbolic increase in flow rate at the SOC extrema)4,48 as well as its modifications,121 and a complete optimization of vfl for each SOC value.4,130,131 These strategies are mentioned in the order of the least to the strongest positive impact on EE.
For the above mentioned vfl management strategies, there are several specific features about the implementation of the operation modes that we want to highlight: König et al. proposed an asymmetric flow rate profile for a VRFB cell stack, where the average flow rate during charging is significantly higher than during discharging.4 The authors calculated that an increased flow rate during the charging process results in an overall lower SOCE within the cell stack. Due to dependence of the SOC on the membrane crossover rate and to the lowered concentration overvoltages originating from the decreased SOCE, a positive effect on qBf, VE, and CE is expected. In contrast to that, a decrease in the average vfl during the discharge process (relative to the charging process) causes a higher overall SOCE in the flow cell stack, which increases the average voltage and, thus, additionally reduces voltage losses. The overall reduction of pump power losses, species crossover, and concentration overvoltages resulted in an EE increase of 1.2% for a Nafion 115 membrane. Yang et al. investigated strategies to manage vfl both by a step-wise increase at the end of the charging process and by a continuous growth in accordance with a fixed ffl.121 Both strategies improved EERT in comparison to a constant vfl. Although a continuous increase of the flow rate resulted in a slightly higher EERT gain, the stepwise increase was recommended because of its simpler implementation. Jirabovornwisut et al. pointed out that as long as the flow rate is managed according to the SOCB, there is an increased risk of losses in EERT upon SOCE imbalances.130 The separate measurement of the SOCE values for both electrolytes can avoid premature or late vfl manipulations reducing pumping power losses. Lim et al. performed an investigation which indicated that most of the polarization contributions in VRFBs are induced by the negolyte.509 Based on this work, it can be speculated that an asymmetric flow rate between negolyte and posolyte might be beneficial for EERT. However, such an asymmetric flow rate may also induce a pressure gradient across the membrane.4,134 Asymmetric flow rates, in particular combined with different viscosities of negolyte and posolyte in the two half-cells can provide a driving force for electrolyte crossover and, consequently, electrolyte imbalances as well as efficiency losses.
In addition to the capacity and efficiency improvements, an appropriate flow rate management can reduce the danger of flow cell overheating and reduce electrolyte degradation. In systems, where the electrolyte temperature in the tanks is constant, an increase of vfl provides an improved transfer of heat away from the reactor, where the main heat generation occurs (see Section 2.4.2).122,135 Battery standby periods are no exception here, because even the heat generated by self-discharge in VRFBs, can cause critical electrolyte temperatures in the reactor.554 Hence, once every several hours during the standby period, the pumps should be switched on. The aforementioned strategy for electrolyte temperature control works only when T in the tanks is considerably lower than the battery's upper Tlim. Due to the rather narrow temperature working ranges of RFB electrolytes, however, ambient temperatures might already exceed the battery's Tlim. In general, the management of vfl is, hence, insufficient to keep T in a safe range. Even at ambient temperatures between 19 and 26 °C, short periods with temperatures above the critical 40 °C threshold were observed in VRFBs.123,554 It should be noted that although only the issue of overheating has been investigated in the scientific literature, low temperatures can also represent a critical issue for battery stability and performance. This is especially important for aqueous FBs (see Section 2.4.2).
In addition to an active management of the flow rate, current load management has an influence on the electrolyte temperature as well. Higher currents and the corresponding heat dissipation increases the overall electrolyte temperature (see Section 2.4.2).123 Hence, a decrease of the current load can be used as a measure to prevent electrolyte overheating. Because the current load is closely connected to the overall ∑η, a current load management can be applied to improve the battery performance. Such strategies utilize a decrease of the battery current when the SOCE limits are approached in order to increase u, VE, and EERT. At lower current loads, however, a decrease in EERT might arise from the prolonged tch/dch due to the longer pump operation125,553 and a decrease in CE due to crossover (see Section 2.4.2).125,553 These conflicting effects on EERT need to be considered during the adjustment of I. Pugach et al. demonstrated for VRFBs, where the average crossover rate varies between charge and discharge, that an operation strategy with different I during the charge and discharge processes reduces crossover-induced CE losses.139 Besides I, the management of voltage loads offers additional opportunities. For example, it is expected to provide the control of ∑η and thereby maintain a required u. Nevertheless, the topic is currently not being investigated to the best of our knowledge.
Within the context of a combined flow rate and current load management, Yang et al. pointed out that high overvoltages at the end and beginning of the charge and discharge are caused by different processes.121 At the end of the respective process, the overvoltage increases due to both concentration and activation polarization, while at the start of each process, the overvoltage is mainly caused by activation polarization alone. Concentration polarization at the start of the process is negligible due to the high concentration of the reactant, while activation polarization is high due to its dependence on the exchange current density i0. The exchange current density itself is proportional to both the oxidized and reduced species concentrations and, thus, is comparably low at the limiting SOCE values. Consequently, a higher flow rate keeps the overall product concentration in the flow cell more uniform and, hence, i0 low at the start of the process. At the end of the charge/discharge process, the reactant concentration represents the limiting factor. A higher vfl increases the reactant concentration in the cell and, thus, decreases both concentration and activation overvoltages. The optimized operation strategy suggested by Yang et al. therefore comprises the application of a low flow rate at the beginning of the charge/discharge and an increased flow rate combined with a decreased current load at the end of the respective process.121 Other combined flow rate and current load operation strategies have been proposed (Fig. 19).13,128,552 They are based on the calculation of electrolyte flow and current parameters and are aiming at maximizing the battery EE, EERT, and u over the complete SOC spectrum. In addition to that, Xiong et al. developed a model considering the optimization of EE and u in combination with temperature optimization to improve the FB performance.551 It is noteworthy, however, that the volatility of renewable energy sources and the unpredictable energy demand in the energy grid might limit the viability of current load management approaches.187,555–560 In addition to that, the actual charge/discharge power output of the battery varies at different SOCB values.557 Consequently, I represents an operation parameter that is, in general, difficult to be controlled appropriately for performance optimization. In fact, however, most of the effects of current loads discussed here and in Section 2.4.2 are dependent on the current density rather than the absolute current I. This offers an alternative current load management strategy: if the battery design allows for an effective change of the active electrode surface area, a variation of the current density is possible without varying I. In this context, Schreiber et al.561 described a VRFB system with three separate fluid circuits and five cell stacks with 36 to 40 cells each. The first fluid circuit comprised only one stack and was continuously operated. The other fluid circuits contained two stacks each and were active/inactive depending on the battery operation mode. The two modes are referred to as an ‘all string’ (i.e., all three fluid circuits are operated) and a ‘multi-stage’ mode. During the multi-stage operation, nominally one stack is operated and the other two are only operated when additional power is needed. The installation yielded a 25% increase in the battery WB when operated at ‘multi-stage’ mode compared with the results from the ‘all strings’ one. This gain was a result of the improved Pp efficiency achieved by this operation strategy. It should be noted, however, that the standby strings cannot be switched on instantly; they require a ramp-up time of up to one minute.561

As has been pointed out in this section, flow rates, current loads, and voltage loads can be applied to optimize the battery performance. In contrast to this, active temperature management is usually applied to optimize the FB lifetime and safety. Its impact on EERT and u are hardly investigated so far.551 However, we anticipate a potential for performance improvements and encourage further investigations.
5.3. Battery management systems for FBs
In industrial applications, the aforementioned capacity recovery and operation strategies for the performance optimization of FBs are usually automated and handled by the so-called battery management system (BMS). Although scientific literature on BMS for flow batteries is rare, a BMS is essential for the implementation of large-scale FBs; therefore, some basic information on this topic is provided in this section.

5.3.1. Functions of a BMS for FBs. 
A BMS is essential for the safe operation of a battery system and ensures compliance with the specified technical battery parameters, with special focus on its lifetime and efficiency.562 Depending on the complexity of the device (e.g., size, number of cells in a stack, number of stacks in a FB) and the FB type, a BMS fulfils several tasks (see Fig. 20). In particular, the BMS has to take care of the energy, power, and thermal management of the FB.
 Fig. 20  Schematic representation of tasks a BMS for FB has to fulfil. Adopted from Rahimi-Eichi et al.7 
In order to derive the basic input variables for a BMS, the system has to continuously monitor important battery-related parameters. However, the number of directly accessible variables is limited to the direct measurement of physical quantities such as voltage, current, flow rate, pressure drop, and the physicochemical parameters of the electrolyte such as the electrolyte temperature, the ion concentrations, and others (see Section 2.4).444,535,540,550,563–568 Based on the various measurement techniques and setups (see Section 3), these variables can be empirically obtained via sensors during battery operation and can be utilized to estimate important state variables such as the battery or electrolyte SOC (see Section 4.1) and SOH (see Section 4.2). The BMS then uses the obtained state variables for the calculation and display of practically important parameters (e.g., the remaining charge/discharge time) and to adjust the operational parameters (e.g., flow rate, current load) to optimize the battery operation. The applied energy management depends on the specific use case of the FB.7,569 It ensures that energy is only stored when necessary, while taking care of the peculiarities of the battery system during its operation. In this context, the BMS may apply the specific operation strategies (see Section 5.2).115 An inter-cell-balancing, as typical for conventional Li-ion batteries or lead-acid installations, is usually not employed, but may be beneficial to connect and disconnect individual stacks. During the operation of the FB, energy loss mechanisms release heat which increases the system temperature (see Section 2.4). The BMS actively monitors this parameter and is able to actively dissipate this heat if a thermal management system is employed. Thermal modelling and heat management were intensively investigated for the VRFB (see also Section 5.2).123,444,570,571 Especially with regard to the acquisition of sensor data for the BMS, temperature changes in the electrolyte of interest due to heat accumulation may have a huge influence on the battery and electrolyte PCPs, as pointed out in Section 2.4.2, and, consequently, can distort SOC and SOH measurement. This fact further highlights the importance of an adequate thermal battery management. A BMS further ensures safety and protection of the RFB by avoiding processes causing immediate and significant harm to the battery components. This includes, e.g., a leakage control (electrolyte level monitoring), a short-circuit protection, protection against overcharging, and thermal shutdown.535 For instance, in the case of a heat accumulation, the BMS is able to shut down the battery system in order to prevent electrolyte degradation (common in organic RFBs) or the precipitation of active materials (VRFB). In some RFBs, the BMS may feature an additional mechanism, which may be described as active electrolyte management.159,535,554 Some RFB chemistries allow for a mitigation of negative effects caused by, e.g., crossover. Processes for the recovery of the initial concentrations and equal SOCs in both half-cells can be automated using additional hardware (see Section 5.1). However, BMS features like this are commonly not disclosed in scientific publications dealing with intermediate to large-scale FB systems.


5.3.2. General components and architecture of a BMS for FBs. 
The general structure of a BMS for FBs is shown in Fig. 21. The BMS is connected to a variety of sensors, which are designed to continuously monitor the important system parameters (see Section 5.3.1 and Fig. 20). Ideally, the used sensors are galvanically isolated from the processing unit.
 Fig. 21  Schematic representation of the structure of a BMS for FBs. Data links are represented by dashed lines, while power connections are represented by solid lines. 
According to Section 5.3.1, a BMS of a FB requires information about:
• Important battery state variables, i.e. SOC and SOH;
• Practically important parameters, i.e. flow rate, current and voltage;
• Parameters ensuring safety and protection, i.e. electrolyte level, temperature, short-circuit and overcharge related voltages and currents.
Therefore, only sensors, which provide data about aforementioned characteristics with the accuracy required for specific kind of a FB and of a BMS, are integrated in the battery.
As soon as expense of an additional sensor appears to be higher than the benefit caused by its operation (e.g., increased EERT, u, Lcyc and Lcal; or the obviation of costs caused by a system downtime), the application of the sensor becomes uneconomical.
The execution of tasks other than charging or discharging is performed by actuators. Typical examples in a FB include pumps, valves, electrical relays, and heat exchangers. These devices are actively controlled, enabling a manipulation of the operational parameters of the FB system. As already discussed in Section 5.2, these can have both direct and indirect impacts on the battery performance. Whether one or the other case is being chosen by the BMS is based on the intended application of the FB and the parameter settings programmed into the BMS.535 The central part of the BMS is its processing unit, which acquires signals from all linked sensors in a data acquisition module, processes them, and estimates relevant parameters in a state estimation algorithm module, in which often theoretical values for a simplified model of the battery are derived and processed as well (see Section 4.1.7).7,569 It furthermore stores the required operating parameters and calibration data. Adjacent to the processing unit may be a user interface for data output and manual user input. Additionally, depending on the BMS architecture, the processing unit may control all system actuators as well as the power interface. Furthermore, it determines the operation mode of the battery which, in turn, depends on its supply capability and the external demand. For a hierarchical BMS structure, these tasks are part of superordinate levels, which receive the relevant data computed in the processing unit. The different layers are responsible for groups of cells arranged in packs and modules down to single cells.7 An overview of different BMS architectures is given by the publication of Steinhorst et al.572 Large arrays of single cells (like lead acid or Li-battery storage facilities) often use a distributed BMS with processing units monitoring each hierarchical level. In these installations, only the top level is responsible for the response of the battery system to the grid or application demands, while the lower levels acquire and process the data for cell packs, modules and individual cells, respectively.7,563,573 In FBs, however, single cells are arranged in cell stacks, which may be monitored individually but are electrically connected in series using bipolar plates. This setup is usually operated by a non-hierarchical BMS, in which the processing unit is centralized (e.g., a computer using the proper software). Examples are provided by publications focusing on intermediate to large-scale FBs.535,540,550,557,564–568,574–576 The power system is operated according to the data provided by the processing unit. It is responsible for the electrical management of the battery, i.e., the regulation as well as distribution of energy to and from the battery as well as in the internal electrical system. Even though it is actively controlled by the BMS, the power system may be physically separated from other BMS parts, in particular in larger battery assemblies. It contains the main electrical circuit breaker for the disconnection of the battery from the grid, the power generation unit or electrical load, an AC–DC inverter for the connection between the battery DC power system and the external AC system, a transformer for AC manipulation, and the electrical power supply for the BMS as well as all the battery sensors and actuators. It may as well house internal DC–DC converters, circuit breakers for individual stack lines or fuses, always depending on battery design and application.535,561
The only hitherto published comprehensive description of a BMS for a 9 kW/27 kWh VRFB was recently conducted by Trovò.577 The BMS in this case was based on a PC LabView environment that uses the input of various sensors (OCV cell with full-cell resolution, sensors for pressure, temperature, electrolyte levels, flow rate, stack current, stack voltage, individual cell voltages, and the power consumption of pumps and inverters). With these input variables, the system was able to control the temperature management, power management and pumping units. The BMS further has control of the power management system, consisting of a variable load (resistors) and a transformer.
Finally, we would like to note that, due to economic considerations, the number of sensors integrated for the BMS is limited. In order to lower maintenance costs of a FB and to keep the overall system complexity and computational effort low, only necessary sensors should be installed. Nevertheless, this aspect is rarely investigated in the FB literature and their share of the overall FB costs is largely unknown.578–582

6. Summary and conclusion
In this review, a hierarchy of the major battery and electrolyte parameters, which significantly have an impact on the overall flow battery performance, was proposed. In particular, the importance of electrolyte parameters and their complex interdependencies to the battery performance parameters was discussed. Furthermore, literature-known methods for their characterization, some of their pitfalls, battery operation strategies, and capacity maintenance approaches were comprehensively surveyed and discussed. To achieve maximum battery performance characteristics, each of the parameter levels of the suggested hierarchy should be well investigated and properly considered. Therefore, we encourage to increase research and development efforts in this field to make full use of the performance potentials of nowadays flow battery electrolytes and designs. In this context, we would like to conclude the following points, which might contribute to guiding and inspiring future research:
• Most of the electrochemical flow battery experiments performed to date are conducted in full flow battery setups and, consequently, the obtained results reflect the complex interdependencies of battery cell design, applied conditions, and electrolyte properties. As a consequence, it is difficult to distinguish between individual contributions. Due to the strong impact of electrolyte properties on the battery performance and lifetime, which have been highlighted throughout this review, we suggest implementing techniques capable of measuring individual electrolyte properties to understand the performance limitations and degradation mechanisms in flow batteries.
• A multitude of methods to measure the different electrolyte properties exists and have been distinctly applied for the analysis of flow batteries in the recent years. However, the combination of these techniques, in which the benefits from each approach are utilized, is sparsely reported. For example, the combination of chemical and electrochemical analysis provides opportunities for the in situ characterization of redox couples and should be utilized more frequently.
• We encountered numerous publications where sensor calibration (e.g., conductometers) is not carefully stated, not performed at all or performed in conditions that do not reflect the actual experimental setup (e.g., in terms of concentrations). In order to keep the accuracy, reproducibility, and comparability of experimental results on a high level, we highly recommend careful calibration of any sensor in accordance with the respective protocol and under consideration of the experimental conditions (Sections 3 and 3.4).
• The correct and careful placement of sensors is equally important for the accurate analysis of electrolyte parameters in particular for the in situ monitoring of operating flow batteries. For example, within the literature reports including temperature measurements of FB electrolytes, rather different sensor placements are reported, which affects comparability between different studies. Among the different locations, the direct contact of temperature sensor with the electrolyte is expected to deliver more reliable results compared with other placements, e.g., in an oil bath or at the electric heating plate (Section 3.6).
• The ongoing development of long-term stable flow battery electrolytes necessitates the development of standardized and highly accurate analytical approaches to predict electrolyte lifetimes, unravel degradation mechanisms, and to develop efficient capacity recovery approaches (Sections 4 and 5). Novel techniques like the unbalanced compositionally symmetric flow cell test can provide significant advancements for the flow battery electrolyte characterization; however, the limitations and pitfalls of such new methods need to be thoroughly understood before a wide application is urged. We highly encourage more in-depth methodologic investigations of this and all other new approaches that are currently suggested for the characterization and monitoring of the “next-generation” flow battery electrolytes. Furthermore, the development of rapid aging tests for highly stable electrolytes is desirable.
• Flow battery lifetime is strongly connected to the state-of-charge and state-of-health. Both are usually evaluated on the battery rather than the electrolyte level. However, battery and electrolyte values need to be distinguished, because their values can differ significantly and individual electrolyte SOC as well as SOH values provide more reliable information on the battery state. This distinction needs to be considered for operation strategies and battery management as well. Furthermore, the frequently reported issues of half-cell imbalances in all types of flow batteries highlights the need for reliable and accurate approaches for the determination of individual electrolyte SOC and SOH values (Sections 4 and 5).
• The significant variations of nearly all physicochemical electrolyte parameters with the electrolyte SOC and SOH stresses the importance of both parameters for the in situ and ex situ characterization.
• The surveyed SOC measurement methods have an extensive list of vulnerabilities in common since they are prone to, e.g., error accumulation over time, require mandatory calibration, are temperature and concentration dependent, possess high computational demands, come with high hardware costs, lack a required half-cell resolution, destroy the sample during measurement, and/or exhibit limited accuracy (Section 4.1). Among all literature-known methods, so far only the amperometric approaches utilizing mass-transfer limited currents seem to overcome all of the aforementioned drawbacks. However, as for all new approaches we highly encourage to carefully investigate and characterize this method further in order to unravel its limitations, improve the measurement accuracies, and to make use of its opportunities (Section 4.1.6).
• The field of electrolyte SOH estimation is not well investigated yet. However, some of the techniques used for the SOC measurement indirectly measure the concentrations of redox species. Thus, some of these techniques might be used for the electrolyte SOH estimation (Section 4.2). We highly recommend increasing the efforts for the development of measurement techniques capable of differentiating between the capacities/SOHs of the individual electrolytes in a flow battery.
• Commonly utilized full cell battery cycling (including symmetric cells) is a comparably simple method to evaluate the stability of redox-active electrolytes. However, it cannot provide reliable analyses of individual substances excluding membrane crossover. Such methods require improved characterization techniques and should be applied at the later stages of stability investigations. New methods need to be developed, which enable the accurate measurement of capacity fade rates of individual electrolytes at distinct SOC and SOH values outside of the battery. Only ex situ experiments can safely exclude any interference from apparent capacity fade sources (Sections 3.2.1 and 4.3).
• Stability and lifetime investigations are usually performed under room temperature conditions in most reports. However, experiments at increased and decreased temperatures on the cell level need to be performed more frequently, in particular for those electrolytes, for which low or extremely low capacity fade rates are observed at ambient temperature. This is mandatory to enable a thorough evaluation of novel materials.
• It is noteworthy that in the majority of the studies included in our literature survey, flow battery experiments are presented as single experiments without corresponding reproducibility tests. Although this might be justified sometimes under very restricted conditions, we highly recommend the at least three-fold repetition of experiments. This is mandatory to ensure good scientific practice in this rapidly evolving research field, to facilitate comparability between the work of different research groups, and to identify necessary research tasks as well as promising research directions.
• Active temperature management is usually applied to optimize the FB lifetime and safety. However, its impact on both battery round-trip efficiency and utilization factor are hardly investigated so far. We anticipate a potential for performance improvements and suggest further investigations.
• During our literature research we found only a few reports dealing with intermediate to large-scale RFBs disclosing the respective BMS system. However, some key features thereof, e.g., rebalancing schemes and units were left undisclosed. We highly encourage the disclosure of such features, since they are a key factor in improving the battery lifetime.
• Despite its importance for practical applications, the economic considerations and cost evaluations for new methods and sensor technologies are extremely rare in FB literature; thus, we highly encourage research on this particular issue.

Chemical characterization methods (see Section 3.1)

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy	Determination of chemical structures containing NMR-active nuclei such as 1H or 51V.145 Investigation of reaction mechanisms in a battery	Generally ex situ	Mainly suitable for investigations of organic liquid electrolytes in FBs;15,142,147–157 some investigations of electrolytes for conventional batteries,146 vanadium-based,71 and metal-based electrolytes158 were performed as well.

In situ possible141–143
UV/vis spectroscopy	Measurement of species concentration, limited structural information	
In situ and ex situ	Sensitivity strongly depends on the nature of measured substance and experimental conditions;159,163,168,172–175,177 interactions of solution species by, e.g., complexation cause strongly non-linear dependencies;161,165 used for vanadium159–195 and organic-based12,196 electrolytes.
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy	Measurement of species concentration; structural information	
In situ and ex situ	Sensitive method; frequently used for structural analysis of organic compounds; was used for structural analyses and SOC determination of RFB electrolytes.176,197,198
Raman spectroscopy	Measurement of species concentration;199 structural information	
Ex situ
	Good supplement to IR spectroscopy for determination of molecular structures; frequently used for investigation of solid surfaces but was applied to investigate molecular structures in VRFBs as well.140,199–201
Mass spectrometry (MS)	Determination of molecular structure	
Ex situ
	Substances other than the active species cause noise; accumulation of deposits in the MS device; fragmentation may occur; often coupled with chromatography; there are many examples of couplings of electrochemical cells and MS analysers;202–209 the method is costly and sensitive to electrolyte composition (especially to background concentration), has been applied in FBs;206,210 sample is destroyed.
Inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-MS	Determination of elemental composition	
Ex situ
	Modification of MS that is mostly applicable with metal-based FB electrolytes;211,212 sample is destroyed; no information about the redox state is provided.
Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and atomic emission spectroscopy (AES/OES)	Determination of elemental composition	
Ex situ
	Especially valuable for samples containing metal ions or metalloids; frequently used for trace metal analyses;213 was used for several investigations of VRFB electrolytes;214–216 no information about the redox state is provided.
Electron spin resonance (ESR)	Determination of chemical structures containing unpaired electrons; concentration measurement197,227,228	
Ex situ
	Method was applied for investigation of both metal-218–222 and organic-based223–226 electrolytes; measurement error can be significant and interpretations of ESR spectra can be difficult for substances with several unpaired electrons or for interactions with nuclear spins.
Redox titrations	Concentration measurement	
Ex situ
	Error of detection depends on many factors and can vary strongly; relatively easy to perform; many examples of application in FBs;150,168,169,184,229–236 sample is contaminated.
CHNS elemental analysis (EA)	Determination of chemical composition; works with organics only	
Ex situ
	Required evaporation of solvent makes method uncomfortable; inorganic ions may produce errors; the method was shown to provide valuable information for investigations of residual organic contents in VRFBs.211



Electrochemical characterization methods (see Section 3.2)

Cell cycling	Evaluation of qpr, wpr, CE, VE, EE, u, approximate and SOHB readings, and Lcyc,	
In situ
	Simple and frequently applied method; requires utilization of larger amounts of electrolytes; variations in cell design, membranes, and cycling conditions cause deviations in all measured parameters; a lot of experiments using redox couples15,23,43 as well as symmetric cell tests15,108,241–245 are performed to study the FB electrolytes’ performance.
Cell polarization curves	Investigation of ∑η and performances for the specific parameters of the cell	
In situ
	Provides approximate results;37 typically, used for basic assessments;247 requires utilization of larger amounts of active materials.
Current interruption (CI) and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT)	Investigation of activation and ohmic contributions to ∑η	
In situ
	Provides approximate results;37,251 requires utilization of relatively big amounts of active materials.
Electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)	Detailed picture of all battery ∑η. Derivation of kr, Cdl, D	
In situ and ex situ	For the method's usage, detailed knowledge of the reaction mechanism is needed in order to build an electric circuit representing the mechanism and to use it for fitting and further data evaluation;129,249,252–255 high sensitivity, low material consumption.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV)	Primary picture of reversibility of electrochemical reaction;262 evaluation of E1/2 and D with good precision; evaluation of kr at extremely high sweep rates	
Ex situ
	Easy to implement; high sensitivity, only low amount of material is required; provides information on electrochemical characteristics (kinetics, diffusion coefficients, etc.) of the redox-active substance;129,259 enables evaluation of general electrochemical reversibility but usually gives no information on the chemical stability under bulk electrolysis conditions.
Rotating disk electrode (RDE)	Evaluation of kr and D129	
Ex situ
	Useful method to determine electrochemical reaction kinetics and diffusion parameters at once; requires larger amounts of electrolyte.37,229,263
Spectroelectro-chemical measurements	Determination of molecular structures, mechanisms of electrochemical reactions and stability analysis in situ; combination of advantages of both chemical and electrochemical analysis	Depends on the procedure	Combination of UV/vis, IR, Raman, NMR, and MS with electrochemical methods (e.g., cell cycling or CV)265–277

Ex situ


	Used as an IUPAC standard; uncomfortable to use because hydrogen contaminates the electrolytes during the investigation; requires calibration.293
Glass electrode	
Ex situ and in situ	Low speed of response (range of minutes); accuracy decreases at pH ≥ 12; compact, does not contaminate electrolyte; brittle, potential drifts slowly (i.e., regular calibration is required);2,129 suitable for RFB investigations.
Transistor-based sensors	
Ex situ and in situa	Faster speed of response, smaller possible sizes and higher sensitivity compared to glass electrodes, robust; accuracy decreases at pH ≥ 12; potential drifts slowly (i.e., regular calibration is required);2,294,295 suitable for RFB investigations.
Metal–metal oxide sensors	
Ex situ and in situa	Often have specific range of work (depending on material); can be significantly miniaturized and have higher sensitivity compared to glass electrodes; robust; strong potential drift, hence very often calibration is needed.296,297
Dyes and optical analysis	
Ex situ

Ex situ and in situ	Best accuracy in the range of 10−5 to 102 mS cm−1; disturbances of signal occur at higher conductivities due to high cell polarizability; relatively compact; possibility of corrosion and fouling, which can strongly disturb results; requires calibration prior to usage.351
Four-pole contact cell	
Ex situ and in situ	Best accuracy in the range of 10−5 to ≥102 mS cm−1; relatively compact; possibility of corrosion and fouling, which can strongly disturb results; requires calibration prior to usage;351 suitable for RFB investigations.

Vibrating (oscillatory)	
Ex situ and in situa	Fast response rates; fits to investigation of both Newtonian and non-Newtonian liquids; requires calibration.394,395,397,398

Absolute	0.8 to 1.8 g mL−114,219,232,324,331,337,338,340,343,348,357,359,362,363,365,388,389,391,401–403	
Ex situ
	Accuracy significantly depends on procedure; can have highest accuracy (uncertainty of up to 10−5% for pure solids); requires highly accurate volume measurement;407 for liquids, the precision is lower, but deviation from other methods have been reported to be negligible.363,402,403

Temperature (see Section 3.7)

Liquid in glass	−35 to 80 °C9,10,14,64,71,88,135,151,155,156,158,185,194,212,230,327,328,340,371,372,410,412–446	
Ex situ and in situa	The actual work range is from −200 to 600 °C; uncertainty ranges from 0.005 to 4 °C; cheap, easy to use; slow response with a purely analogue signal.410
Thermoresistors

State-of-charge (see Section 4.1)

Coulomb counting (4.1.1)	
Ex situ and in situ	Its simplicity and accuracy for systems with high coulombic efficiency in short-term measurements makes it suitable for the online calibration of other SOC monitoring methods;14,198,451–455 prone to severe error accumulation over time and, thus, should not be used as a stand-alone monitoring method; requires exact knowledge of the starting SOC.
Titration (4.1.2)	
Ex situ
	Reliable and accurate but time-consuming method; is frequently utilized and widely accepted as a reliable validation method to evaluate the estimation errors of other SOC measurement techniques.6,160,169,170,230,456–458
Open circuit voltage (OCV) (4.1.3)	
Ex situ and in situ	One of the standard methods; applicable in a wide range of electrolytes; moderate absolute errors of <5%, temperature- and concentration-dependencies as well as the requirement for initial calibration and frequent recalibrations limit its reliability in industrial applications.8,14,25,140,175,340,455,458–462
Spectroscopy and photometry (4.1.4)	
Ex situ and in situ	Wide-spread applicability to different RFB chemistries; a thorough understanding of the underlying solution chemistry at different concentrations of the analyte is required in combination with accurate calibration under all possible combinations of electrolyte compositions, total concentrations, and temperatures;12,159–167,169–171,186,196–199,227,228,242,271,463–468 low absolute errors of ≤3% were reported.165,166
Conductivity (4.1.5)	
Ex situ and in situ	Requires calibration under all possible combinations of concentrations and temperatures; applicable in systems with linear conductivity-SOC dependence;105,159,242,328,340,469,470 relative errors of ≤1% were reported.328
Viscosity and density (4.1.5)	
Ex situ and in situ	Requires calibration under all possible combinations of concentrations and temperatures; is used in systems with linear viscosity/density-SOC dependence; viscosity-based measurements can be performed in situ based on pressure drop sensors which simplifies the sensor system but it decreases accuracy causing up to 10% absolute deviation from SOC values measured by OCV;9,14,242,340,471 RMSD of ≤4% were reported.14
Refractive index (4.1.5)	
Ex situ and in situ	Requires calibration under all possible combinations of concentrations and temperatures; high refractive index sensitivity is needed for method application;340,457,472 measurement accuracy for SOC determination was not evaluated versus standard methods and, thus, remains unknown.
Acoustic properties (4.1.5)	
Ex situ and in situ	Requires calibration under all possible combinations of concentrations and temperatures; measurement of acoustic wave velocity is strongly dependent on temperature, but measurement of acoustic attenuation was temperature-independent for VRFB electrolytes;230,456 moderate absolute errors of ≤5% were reported.230
Amperometry (4.1.6)	
Ex situ and in situ	No calibration required; only temperature- and concentration-independent method reported so far; enables measurement of electrolyte state-of-charge; demonstrated so far only for VRFB, ferri-/ferrocyanide, and vanadium electrolytes but applicability to a wide range of RFB electrolytes is anticipated; requires that both redox states are in solution; absolute RMSDs ≤3% reported.455
Model-based methods (4.1.7)	
In situ
	Requires calibration under all possible combinations of concentrations and temperatures; usually do not demand additional sensor hardware; therefore, considered to be cost-efficient; requires accurate RFB models and comes at relatively high computational demand; possible to predict not only the battery SOC but also the concentration imbalances, crossover flux, and the attainable battery capacity; cannot deliver half-cell resolution when performed alone and, hence, electrolyte SOCs remain unknown; temperature influence is insufficiently investigated;476–495 low RMSDs of ≤1% were reported.481,485,487,491–493



State-of-health (present and prospects) (see Section 4.2)

Redox titration	
Ex situ
	Is used to measure substance concentrations and, hence, can be applied to measure SOH; reliable with moderate accuracy (5%159), but time-consuming method without online measurement capability.6,160,168,169,345,359
OCV	
In situ
	The method is focused on SOC monitoring but novel fitting procedures combined with coulomb counting enable in situ capacity and SOH determination on both battery and electrolyte level.14,455
Spectroscopy and photometry	
Ex situ and in situ	Is used to measure substance concentrations; hence, can be applied to measure SOH. Requires dilution of electrolyte or very thin cuvettes; for in situ measurements a combination with independent methods for SOC measurement is required to estimate the SOH.12,162,166,180,271
Material properties based	Depends on the property	SOC can be measured by means of conductivity, viscosity, density, refractive index and acoustic properties, hence these techniques can be potentially applied for SOH readings.159,328,340,457
Amperometry	
Ex situ and in situ	SOH measurement for the stability assessment utilizing steady-state amperometry at microelectrodes was reported for diluted electrolytes.501
Bulk cell cycling	
In situ
	Galvanostatic and potentiostatic cycling experiments in bulk cells enable battery capacity and SOH determination via coulomb counting; strongly related to stability and lifetime assessment.11,15,23,43,271
Other electrochemical methods	Depends on the method	Require base of essential parameters like electrode surface area, diffusion coefficients, rate constants, reaction schemes; have the potential of application for ex situ SOH measurement.14,15,43,229,263,502,503
Model-based approaches	
In situ
	For some of the model-based state-of-charge monitoring methods a co-estimation of the battery SOH or the battery capacity was reported;484,485,491 usually cannot predict individual electrolyte capacities; the only exception to this introduced two OCV cells, which mitigates one of the main advantages of this method (i.e., no additional hardware requirement).478



Stability and lifetime assessment (see Section 4.3)


Ex situ SOH monitoring methods	
Ex situ
	Offline analysis of chemical degradation mechanisms in individual electrolytes by, e.g., NMR, UV/vis spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry under different conditions (i.e., different SOCs, temperatures, total concentrations, pH values, etc.); requires frequent extraction of sample aliquots.
Bulk cycling, full cell	
In situ
	Measurement of battery capacity fade rates qBf; crossover effects limit the evaluation of individual electrolyte stabilities; hence, provides an isolated information representing only aging of the battery as a whole; the assessment of accuracy of the method and test protocols require further development.11,15,23,43
Bulk cycling, symmetric unbalanced cell	
In situ
	More reliable than bulk cycling methods but requires careful experimentation; enables stability assessment on electrolyte level by measurement of electrolyte capacity fade-rates qEf; impact of crossover of redox-active species from non-CLS to the CLS on the measured fade rates is not sufficiently investigated; further accuracy investigations and standardized test protocols are required.15,23,43,455
