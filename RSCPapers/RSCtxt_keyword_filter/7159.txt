    , Accepted 1st March 2019First published on 4th March 2019AbstractThree different fluorine (4-CF3, 3,5-CF3 and 3,4,5-F) end-capped, A2–π–A1–π–A2 type small molecular non-fullerene acceptor molecules (1CFPzDP, 2CFPzDP, and 3FPzDP) containing a common central core acceptor, namely dipyrrolo[2,3-b:2′,3′-e]pyrazine-2,6(1H,5H)-dione (PzDP), have been synthesized and characterized. Density functional methods exhibit the distinct structural features of the PzDP unit upon comparison with benzodipyrrolidone (BzDP), i.e., the presence of electron rich heteroatoms from the pyrazine core of the PzDP unit increased the planarity of the molecular system through intra/intermolecular non-covalent bonding interactions. In this study, end-capped fluorination was introduced onto the PzDP unit to enhance the intermolecular interactions, oxidative stability, and charge mobility. Moreover, we have made an attempt to investigate the positional substitution effects of F and CF3 units on the optoelectronic properties. As envisaged, the synergistic combination of these two distinct individual functionalities into a single molecular system significantly increased the optoelectronic properties. DFT and TDDFT calculations substantiated the experimental observations by means of planarity, energy levels and charge transfer transitions. All the dyes exhibit two reduction potentials; the HOMO and LUMO values are measured to be −6.08/−4.05 eV, −6.21/−4.08 eV, and −6.09/−4.06 eV for 1CFPzDP, 2CFPzDP, and 3FPzDP, respectively. The energy levels are well-matched with regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) (−5.0/−3.0 eV), which can act as an n-type semiconductor for bulk heterojunction organic solar cell (BHJOSC) applications. Fluorescence quenching experiments revealed an efficient charge transfer between the donor material P3HT and the synthesized acceptor molecules. Td values of the dyes are in the range of 359–382 °C representing their good thermal stability. DFT calculations to obtain key photovoltaic parameters such as open-circuit voltage (Voc), exciton binding energy (Eb) and transition characteristics for the developed and reference acceptor systems have been performed. Based on the properties evaluated, these dyes are found to be promising electron acceptor candidates for the fabrication of BHJOSCs.
Introduction
In recent years, various renewable photovoltaic technologies such as dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs), and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have emerged for the future need.1–5 Of these, BHJOSCs are at the forefront towards commercialization in this field because the toxic and corrosive active elements used in the other technologies hamper their feasiblity.6,7 In recent years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of BHJOSCs has reached a plateau over a short period after the intensive development of small molecular non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) as viable alternatives to the expensive fullerene derivatives.8–10 Very recently, Y. Chen et al. achieved the record and certified power conversion efficiency of 17.3% by adopting a tandem cell strategy which comprises a mixture of a polymer donor and two small molecular non-fullerene acceptors as active materials in the device fabrication.1 Viewing this trend, it can be said that the day is not far off when this technology could be utilized towards commercialization purposes. Hence, we believe that there is still a possibility to boost the photovoltaic performance of BHJOSCs in terms of increasing the electron mobility of the NFAs. This can be accomplished by (1) introducing more heteroatoms into the acceptor skeleton, which will remarkably improve the n-type character and (2) attachment of more polar chemical functionalities at the peripheral positions for efficient intermolecular interactions.3,4 Keeping these considerations in mind, a strong electron accepting dipyrrolo[2,3-b:2′,3′-e]pyrazine-2,6(1H,5H)-dione (PzDP), a core expansion of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) with proquinoidal 1,4-pyrazine (Pz), has been chosen as a central unit for the following advantages: (1) the strong electron accepting pyrazine unit in PzDP downshifts the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and (2) increases the oxidative stability; (3) heteroatoms present in the pyrazine and amide functionalities not only augment the n-type character but also enhance the planarity of the system through intramolecular H-bonding interactions.5,8
Terminal modulation of the electron donor/acceptor materials has been proven to increase the PCE because the introduced chemical functionalities at terminal positions can induce a large impact on the charge mobility and nanostructure of the blended films due to several types of intra and intermolecular interactions.9 Moreover, it facilitates exciton dissociation at the D–A interface.11 Among various electron withdrawing functionalities reported, we have chosen small sized, σ-electron withdrawing, fluorine (F and CF3) units as end-capped substitutions. Various experimental studies have revealed that fluorination is one of the unique approaches in several ways: (1) it attains a high oxidative stability by energy level lowering;12,13 (2) it converts the p-type materials into n-type/ambipolar materials;14 (3) it shifts the energy levels through various intermolecular interactions, such as C–H⋯F, C–F⋯F, and C–F⋯π contacts upon solid state packing or thin film formation;15 (4) efficient contacts with PEDOT:PSS or the electrode surface, which can reduce the resistance resulting in charge transport facilitation;16,17 (5) increasing the crystalline nature of the materials, etc.9,10,18 Much effort has been devoted to the fluorination on the electron donor and acceptor materials for organic solar cell applications.18 In particular, recently, J. Lee and co-workers have developed the isomorphic fluorobenzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazole-based polymers with an ultrahigh mobility of 17.8 cm2 V−1 s−1, revealing the benefits of fluorination.2 Combining these two individual inherent electron mobility building blocks (PzDP and fluorine units at the central/end-capped positions, respectively) into a single π-conjugated skeleton can accelerate the electron mobility to a higher extent. In addition, the synergistic downshift of the HOMO and LUMO levels induced by PzDP is beneficial to enhance the Voc, Jsc, and oxidative stability and the fluorine and CF3 substitution at various positions can dramatically affect the optoelectronic properties and photovoltaic performance.19
On the basis of the above considerations, herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of three fluorine functionalized NFAs, 1CFPzDP, 2CFPzDP, and 3FPzDP (Fig. 1). We have chosen PzDP as the core building block and (trifluoromethyl)benzene/1,3-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene/1,2,3-trifluorobenzene moieties as end-capping units. The structure–property relationship of the three new NFAs by varying the position/number of trifluoromethyl/fluorine was systematically investigated through various experimental characterization and DFT/TDDFT methods.

Experimental
Measurements and instruments
Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance (300 MHz; Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) spectrometer in CDCl3 with TMS as the internal standard. Time-of-flight mass spectra were recorded with a Bruker MALDI-TOF mass system. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured using a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer. Steady state fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Spex Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer. Cyclic voltammetric measurements were performed on a PC-controlled CHI 620C electrochemical analyzer (CH instruments). Cyclic voltammetric experiments were performed in a 1 mM solution of degassed dry dichloromethane at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 using 0.1 M tetrabutylammoniumperchlorate (TBAP) as the supporting electrolyte. Glassy carbon was used as the working electrode, a saturated calamol electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode and platinum wire as the counter electrode. The working electrode surface was first polished using 1 mm alumina slurry, followed by 0.3 mm alumina slurry on a micro cloth. It was then rinsed with Millipore water and also sonicated in water for 5 min. The polishing and sonication steps were repeated twice. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a TGA/SDTA 851e (Mettler Toledo) in the temperature range of 30–550 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
Computational details
The Gaussian 09 ab initio quantum chemical software package was used to perform the gas phase DFT calculations.20 The DFT method was employed to obtain the ground-state properties, and the time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) method was used for the estimation of the ground to excited-state transitions. The maximum internal forces and the stress acting on all the atoms (<4.5 × 10−4 eV Å−1 and 1.01 × 10−3 kbar, respectively) have been imposed to obtain the energy minimized ground state geometries. All the optimized geometries are subjected to frequency calculations to ensure that each optimized geometry possesses no imaginary frequency, thereby confirming that the obtained geometry corresponds to the global minima on the potential energy surface. The gas phase relaxations of atomic positions were performed by employing the hybrid Becke, three-parameter, Lee–Yang–Parr exchange–correlation functional (B3LYP) and 6-311G(d,p) basis set which is extensively used for the ground state calculations in this study.21 Methyl groups were introduced to replace longer alkyl chains for the purpose of minimizing the computational cost but without compromising the experimental simulations. The resultant optimized geometries were directly used as input for the analysis of the electron density distribution on the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) and TDDFT simulations through single point calculations. The evaluation of 15 vertical singlet–singlet transitions was applied to simulate the UV-vis spectra of the dyes. The integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model (PCM) within the self-consistent field theory has been utilized to describe the solvation of dyes in chloroform medium to mimic the real environment. TDDFT calculations were tuned with various hybrid functionals such as B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP22 and ω97XD23 functionals and a common 6-311G(d,p) basis set. The percentage contribution of individual fragments present in the dyes was calculated against their respective molecular orbitals.24 The geometry optimization of all the radical cations and anions were performed under the UB3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level in chloroform solvent medium. Frequency calculations of cations and anions were also employed to ensure the location of minima stationary points on the potential energy surface. Electrostatic potential surface studies, Mulliken population and Natural bonding analysis (NBO) have been carried out using the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory. The simulation of the major portion of the absorption spectrum and interpretation of the nature of the transitions was performed using GaussSum 2.2.5.25

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route for the preparation of the target compounds 1CFPzDP, 2CFPzDP, and 3FPzDP is depicted in Scheme 1. The bromo derivatives of 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzene, 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene, and 1,2,3-trifluorobenzene undergo Miyaura borylation by treating with BuLi at −78 °C in THF to eliminate the halide ions followed by the addition of 2-isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-[1,3,2]-dioxaborolane to afford the corresponding boronate intermediates 2, 3, and 4, respectively in very good yields ranging from 75–96% (ESI†).25 The target compounds 1CFPzDP, 2CFPzDP, and 3FPzDP were prepared by Pd(PPh3)4 assisted Suzuki coupling reaction of 127,28 with 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The yields are good for the three compounds, ranging from 80 to 85%. All the compounds are dark purple in color. Materials were purified through column chromatography and recrystallization techniques. The chemical structures of all compounds were identified by 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and MALDI-TOF.

Photophysical properties
The UV-visible absorption spectra of the three new PzDP derivatives measured in chloroform (CHCl3) are depicted in Fig. 2a and the results are summarized in Table 1. All the compounds exhibited two absorption bands, one at the short UV region (λmax = 268–283 nm) is assigned to the π–π* transitions of the molecular system and the other at the visible (λmax = 508–516 nm) region is attributed to the intramolecular charge transitions (ICTs) from the fluorine end-capped phenyl units to the central PzDP unit. In this molecular system, both end-capped (F and CF3) and central PzDP units are known to be electron withdrawing building blocks. Isodensity surfaces of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) also substantiated the charge transfer direction from the end-capped units to the strong electron accepting central PzDP unit. The energy levels of the fragments computed by the DFT/B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory reinforced the charge transfer direction i.e., LUMO of PzDP < LUMO of end-capped fluorine substitutions (Fig. S1, ESI†). The molar extinction coefficients of these molecules are in the order of 1CFPzDP > 2CFPzDP > 3FPzDP. The observed higher molar extinction coefficients of these small molecules could result in improved light harvesting capacity. Fluorescence emission spectra of 1CFPzDP, 2CFPzDP, and 3FPzDP (1 × 10−5 M) were recorded in CHCl3 (Fig. 2b) and the results are summarized in Table 1. The emission of 1CFPzDP was obtained at 710 nm, and both dyes 2CFPzDP and 3FPzDP exhibited at 720 nm, respectively. The optical bandgap was measured from the intersection of the absorption-emission spectra and the values are found to be 2.03, 2.13, and 2.03 eV for 1CFPzDP, 2CFPzDP, and 3FPzDP, respectively.

To investigate the extent of charge transfer from the electron donor to the synthesized electron acceptor molecules, fluorescence quenching experiments were carried out. For that experiment, we have used regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) as the reference donor material which possesses the HOMO/LUMO energy levels at −5.0/−3.0 eV, respectively. The obtained results are shown in Fig. 3. The driving force for efficient electron transfer between the LUMO of the electron donor and the LUMO of the electron acceptor is reported to be ≥0.3 eV.29 The measured driving force in our study is in the range of 1.05–1.08 eV which fulfills the important requirement to guarantee a sufficient driving force for efficient charge transfer from P3HT to the acceptor materials. The emission maximum peak of P3HT in CHCl3 was observed at 577 nm. The emission intensity of the P3HT was gradually quenched upon increasing the concentration of acceptor materials (1CFPzDP, 2CFPzDP, and 3FPzDP). This phenomenon suggested an efficient charge transfer between P3HT and the synthesized acceptor molecules. Furthermore, at low quencher concentrations, the dependence of the fluorescence intensity on the concentration of the synthesized molecules is linear in conformity with the Stern–Volmer equation (Fig. 3). The Ksv values of 1CFPzDP, 2CFPzDP, and 3FPzDP were 3.9 × 104 M−1, 2.6 × 104 M−1, and 1.7 × 104 M−1, respectively. These values ensured an efficient charge transfer process for 1CFPzDP when compared to the other two acceptor materials.

Computational studies
In-depth knowledge about the geometry of the dyes is of crucial importance to gain insight about the photovoltaic performance through understanding their structural, electronic, and spectroscopic properties. Though various properties can be predicted from DFT methods, the degree of π-conjugation is considered as one of the important parameters to evaluate structural information of the dyes. This can be generally determined by dihedral angles between the donor/spacer/acceptor segments from the optimized molecular structures. All the dyes have been optimized under the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory. The optimization of several possible geometries in the gas phase has also been carried out to find the global minima on the potential energy surface because slightly higher energy conformations are also possible due to the rotamers. The energy difference between the rotamers is found to be trivial. The selected bond distances and dihedral angles from the optimized geometries of the molecules are displayed in Fig. 4. The optimized structure appears closer to a Z-shaped architecture where the core PzDP acceptor unit is orthogonally attached to both of the donor segments and co-planarity between them is found with a twist angle of 1–3°.30 Moreover, a weak intramolecular hydrogen bonding of 2.20 Å is noticed between the oxygen atom of the keto functionality from the core acceptor unit and the ortho-hydrogen of the proximal phenyl group. This renders the planarity of the electron acceptor system. Introducing more heteroatoms into the planar conjugated skeleton is beneficial for optimal charge transport and efficient intermolecular π–π stacking. To find out the origination of the planarity i.e., whether intramolecular H-bonding arose from the keto or pyrazine functionality, a model molecule (MC) containing benzodipyrrolidone (BzDP) as the core acceptor unit has been chosen where pyrazine is replaced by a phenyl unit. The optimized geometry of MC showed a pronounced torsional deviation of 32° between the BzDP and phenyl units. This torsional deviation originates from the steric repulsion between the ortho-hydrogen of the adjacent phenyl unit and C–H of the BzDP. This structural information clearly showed that the incorporation of the sp2 hybridized N-atom of PzDP increases the proximity between the pyrazine and phenyl units that resulted in a weak intramolecular N⋯H–C bonding (2.28 Å) between the keto functionality and the ortho-hydrogen of the adjacent phenyl unit. These interactions through the keto and pyrazine functionalities at four possible positions significantly enhanced the planarity of the system. The fluorine substitution at the peripheral phenyl unit has no impact on the geometry of the dyes and the torsional deviation between the adjacent phenyl units is found to be 37° for all the dyes. End-capped fluorination results in a very low dipole moment in the ground state. It is mainly attributed to the resonance dipole of fluorine atoms that would easily influence the conjugated skeleton due to 2p–2p orbital overlap with carbon on the one hand and its strong electronegativity on the other hand makes a reverse effect. As a result, these two dipoles effectively cancel out the net dipole moment of the electron acceptor systems of essentially zero. For instance, the ground state dipole moment (μg) of 1CFPzDP was found to be 0.25 Debye and increased to 0.29 from the ground to excited state. This may be ascribed to the meta substitution of CF3 units which is deviated from the principal axis of the dyes, whereas 2CFPzDP and 3FPzDP have zero dipole moments in both states (Table 2).

The isodensity plots of frontier molecular orbitals and energy levels of the dyes obtained from DFT methods have been compared with the energy levels estimated from cyclic voltammetry for better depiction as shown in Fig. 5. The HOMO values of the dyes are in the range of −6.08 to −6.28 eV. However, the DFT computed HOMO–LUMO gap follows a consistent trend with the experimental observation and the values are predicted to be 2.24 eV, 2.29 eV and 2.23 eV for the dyes 1CFPzDP, 2CFPzDP and 3FPzDP, respectively. The HOMO values are marginally underestimated but significant variation has been noticed for the LUMO energy levels. This might be ascribed to the variations in bond length alternation (BLA) prediction by improper long-range correction exchange functionals used for the calculation. The substitution of two strong electron withdrawing CF3 units at the 3,5 positions remarkably lowers the energy levels among the series. To get a clear picture on the impact of end-capped positional substitution of fluorine atoms and CF3 groups on the regulation of the energy levels, an extensive DFT investigation was carried out by partitioning the acceptor and end-capped acceptor units as individual fragments such as 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (F-1CF), 2,5-bis(trifluoromethyl) benzene (F-2CF), 3,4,5-trifluoro benzene (F-3F), benzodipyrrolidone (BzDP) and dipyrrolo[2,3-b:2′,3′-e]pyrazine-2,6(1H,5H)-dione (PzDP). F-1CF synergistically lowers the HOMO and LUMO as compared to the trifluoro substitution (F-3F). It is proven that HOMO lowering is one of the beneficial strategies to ensure high open-circuit voltage (Voc) and LUMO stabilization helps in the efficient dissociation of the excitons formed at the D–A interface.31 F-2CF leads to a further simultaneous downshift of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels. The influence of these fragments is reflected on the energy levels of the electron acceptor systems. The introduction of a pyrazine unit in PzDP reinforces the electron transporting ability in terms of lowering the energy levels over the BzDP fragment (Fig. S1, ESI†).

Electron density distribution analysis has been performed to examine the electronic coupling of the electron acceptors. In the HOMO, electron density is distributed over the entire conjugated backbone of the dyes. For the LUMO, this distribution is confined to the PzDP unit in an orthogonal direction which reveals the strong electron acceptor strength of the core acceptor unit.32
This spatial separation of charge distribution from the end-capped acceptor units to the strong electron accepting PzDP unit upon photoexcitation indicates the efficient intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character. On the other hand, the electron density of the LUMO+1 is delocalized over the entire system through the principal axis except the pyrrolidone parts. Exploring the role of positional substitution of end-capped fluorine and CF3 units on electron density distribution is of utmost importance because it helps to gain the information of the individual contribution of the various segments towards charge transport of the dyes. Keeping this in view, partial density of states (PDOS) calculations were employed by partitioning the electron acceptor dyes into individual segments. As it is a symmetrical skeleton, the two identical parts are integrated as one segment. All the dyes were grouped into three segments coded as A1 (core acceptor), π (phenyl linker) and A2 (F, CF3 end-capped phenyl). As depicted, not much variation is noted in the isodensity surface of the HOMO in all the dyes, i.e., electron density is uniformly delocalized over the entire molecular system (Fig. 6). The electron density of the LUMO is populated only on the central acceptor unit and to a little extent on the adjacent phenyl spacer units. On the other hand, the electron density contribution of LUMO+1 is distinctly varied with respect to the fluorine substitution and the pattern obtained is given in the following order: 3,5-CF3 > 4-CF3 > 3,4,5-F.

TDDFT calculations were employed to investigate the charge transfer transitions involved upon photoexcitation, such as intramolecular charge transfer/π–π* transition upon photoexcitation.33 Various hybrid density functionals such as B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, and ωB97XD, and the 6-311g(d,p) basis set were used to compute the vertical excitation energies in the framework of C-PCM using chloroform as a solvent medium. Of these functionals used in this study, the B3LYP overestimated the excitation energy values, whereas, underestimated results obtained for CAM-B3LYP functional. The ωB97XD functional simulated TDDFT results showed excellent agreement with the experimental absorption values. The B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, and ωB97XD functional predicted TDDFT simulations have been compared with the experimental absorption spectra measured in chloroform as shown in Fig. 7 and the corresponding values are summarized in Table 1. TDDFT study reveals that the major transitions involved are HOMO, LUMO and LUMO+1 upon photoexcitation.

The reorganization energy plays an important role in determining the hole and electron mobilities of the molecules which is composed from the combination of internal and external contributions. The external contribution such as the medium reorganization/outer sphere reorganization energy arising from the polarization effects of the media is of little significance and the quantity cannot be easily predicted. Thus, we have calculated only the internal reorganization energy (λ±) of the molecules. In general, a lower reorganization energy indicates the driving force for high charge transfer rate, i.e., the reorganization energy is inversely proportional to the charge transfer rate.33 Thus, to compare the charge transport properties of the investigated molecules, reorganization energies corresponding to the hole and electron mobilities have been calculated, which represent their relaxation after oxidation and reduction, respectively, using the DFT/B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory. The hole reorganization energy (λ+) of the dyes is in the following order: 1CFPzDP ≈ 2CFPzDP < 3FPzDP but in the case of electron reorganization energy (λ−), the order is predicted to be 1CFPzDP (286 meV) < 2CFPzDP (290 meV) < 3FPzDP (293 meV). This result shows that 4-CF3 substitution undergoes minimal structural relaxation upon oxidation and reduction which is expected to yield better hole/electron mobility (Fig. 8). The optimized geometry of the cations and anions from their neutral form has little impact on the C–C and C–N bond distances during structural relaxation. We have also calculated the ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) of the dyes from their optimized cation and anionic and neutral geometries, respectively. Among the series, IP and EA of 2CFPzDP are found to be higher than 4-CF3 and trifluoro substitutions. The electron affinity of the molecules is in the following order: 2CFPzDP (−3.90 eV) > 3FPzDP (−3.87 eV) > 1CFPzDP (−3.86 eV). This study suggests that increasing the number of CF3 substitutions can be beneficial to improve the oxidation/reduction stability of the dyes.

To investigate the introduction of a pyrazine unit and fluorination on the geometries, bond distances have been measured from the optimized structure from the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory because the σ-electron withdrawing nature of fluorine atoms has a considerable impact on the conjugated skeleton. As expected, fluorine atoms increased the quinoidal character in the end-capped phenyl units by decreasing the bond length values (Fig. S5, ESI†). The bond length alternation difference is also found to be minimal. The CN bond in the PzDP unit is predicted to be 1.298 Å for all the molecules. The bond distance around the pyrazine unit is found to have a remarkable reduction. We also carried out Mulliken population analysis to examine the charge population of the dyes. We are aware that these results are more susceptible to the basis sets chosen for calculations. Therefore, we have used a common 6-311G(d,p) basis set for the calculations that yields qualitative information. Fluorine substitution induces the electropositive character on the proximal carbon atoms attached and trifluoro substitution on 3FPzDP has a dominant influence on the end-capped phenyl units compared to CF3 substitution as the former is directly attached to the aromatic carbons (Fig. S2, ESI†). The nitrogen atoms of the pyrazine unit and pyrrolidone unit significantly increased the electropositive character of the carbon atom which is positioned in between. Electrostatic potential surface (ESP) studies have been employed to identify the electron density cloud environment. The charge deployed sites possessing electropositive/negative regions present in the molecular system is deemed to be essential for efficient intermolecular interactions. The electrostatic potential surface diagram of the dyes is displayed in Fig. S3, ESI.† The charge population on the segments obtained from the electrostatic potential is represented in various colours. Potential increases in the order red (predominantly negative) < orange (negative) < yellow (slightly negative) < green (neutral) < blue (positive). Keto units possess a predominant negative potential region, whereas fluorine atom substitutions bear a slightly negative charge. To explore the effect of fluorine substitution on the delocalization energy of the dyes, NBO analysis has been employed. Of these, delocalization energy of the 2CFPzDP is predicted to be high and the order is as follows (kcal mol−1): 2CFPzDP > 1CFPzDP > 3FPzDP. In addition, fluorine atoms are expected to have better interactions through F⋯H, and C⋯F with the neighbouring molecules and electrode contacts to obtain the optimal photovoltaic performance.
Electrochemical and thermal properties
Determination of the frontier energy levels, such as HOMO and LUMO, of newly synthesized acceptor materials is of crucial importance for their use as active components in BHJOSCs. In this study, we have used cyclic voltammetry (CV) techniques to examine the electrochemical properties. The cyclic voltammograms of the synthesized dyes are depicted in Fig. 9a and the observed reduction potentials, HOMO, and LUMO values are summarized in Table 1. The LUMO energy levels of the derivatives were calculated from the first onset reduction potential by following the equation: LUMO = −(Eredonset + 4.4) eV.34 Two reduction potentials have been noticed for all the dyes. 3FPzDP shows the first and second reversible reduction potentials at −0.34 and −0.80 V, respectively. On the other hand, CF3 substituted dyes such as 1CFPzDP and 2CFPzDP possess quasi-reversible reduction for the first potential (−0.35 V and −0.32 V) but exhibited irreversible reduction at the second site and the values are measured to be −0.76 and −0.78 V, respectively. We have calculated the HOMO from the values of LUMO energy level and optical band gaps of the dyes. The HOMO/LUMO levels of 1CFPzDP (−6.08/−4.05 eV), 2CFPzDP (−6.21/−4.08 eV), and 3FPzDP (−6.09/−4.06 eV) are lower than the energy levels of P3HT (−5.0/−3.0 eV), substantiating efficient electron transfer from the LUMO of the donor to electron acceptors. The obtained electrochemical trend is found to have a consistent trend with the DFT computed energy levels.

To evaluate the thermal properties, thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The representative TGA plots are shown in Fig. 9b and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. Thermal decomposition temperatures (Td) corresponding to 5% weight loss of these compounds were in the range of 359–382 °C, representing their good thermal stability. The melting points of these compounds were in the range of 189–248 °C. This observation clearly indicated good thermal stability of these materials even at high temperatures.
Open circuit voltage and exciton binding energy
One of the essential parameters that determines the photovoltaic performance of OSCs is the open-circuit voltage (Voc) representing the maximum voltage which is derived from the splitting of hole and electron quasi-Fermi levels generated from a solar cell device to an external circuit. Most of the non-fullerene small molecular acceptors reported for OSCs have an optical band gap of around 1.7 to 2.1 eV and yet the Voc barely exceeds 1.0 V, which is approximately just half of the photon's original energy. Hence, to achieve higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in OSCs, a detailed understanding of the origins of Voc and the associated energetic loss mechanisms is inevitable. It is known that the electron acceptor bearing a low-lying LUMO level possesses high Voc because it is proportional to the energy difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and HOMO of the donor. The Voc values of the reference and synthesized NFAs have been computed by comparing with the PTB7-Th (EHOMO = −5.20 eV) and P3HT (EHOMO = −5.12 eV)35 and the obtained results are compiled in the following order: 1CFPzDP > 3FPzDP > 2CFPzDP (Fig. 10).
 Fig. 10  Computed open circuit voltage (Voc) values of the reference (TfIF-4FIC) and the designed molecules 1CFPzDP, 2CFPzDP, and 3FPzDP with respect to the reported donors P3HT and PTB7-Th (energy levels are not to scale). 
Exciton binding energy (Eb) is one of the key factors for determining the rate of charge separation in BHJSCs. A photovoltaic system with small Eb often requires a lower driving force to dissociate the coulombic attraction between the holes and electrons into free charge carriers at the donor–acceptor interface and is generally defined as the difference between the charge separation (HOMO–LUMO) gap and the optical gap of the 1Bu state (vertical excitation energy from the ground state to the first dipole-allowed excited state).36 The order of exciton binding energy for the acceptors is: 2CFPzDP < 1CFPzDP < 3FPzDP and the small Eb of 2CFPzDP and 1CFPzDP might be ascribed to the strong electron withdrawing capability by increasing the number of –CF3 units and positional substitution as well (Table 3).

Qualitative composition of the HLCT state
In this work, we have chosen a new fluorine-substituted wide-bandgap small molecular non-fullerene acceptor named TfIF-4FIC as a reference.37 The reason for selecting this molecule is that it is reported have an optical bandgap of 1.61 eV with low energy loss and provides an excellent PCE of 13.1% using PBDB-T-2F as the donor. The hole and electron reorganization energies of TfIF-4FIC were predicted to be 168 and 187 meV, respectively. The lower reorganization energy of the reference acceptor is mainly attributed to its rigid and fused core unit in comparison to the PzDP based acceptors investigated. The optimized geometry, isodensity surfaces of FMOs and TDDFT-simulated absorption spectra computed using the ωB97XD/6-311G(d,p)/CPCM (chloroform) level of theory are shown in Fig. S4, ESI† and the obtained excitation energy value is well matched with the experimental observation. Essential photovoltaic parameters such as open circuit voltage (Voc), exciton binding energy (Eb) and transition density matrix for the synthesized molecules has been evaluated to provide an elementary understanding of their cell performance and compared with the reference acceptor (TfIF-4FIC).
During photoexcitation, most of the formed Frenkel excitons (the bound electron–hole pairs) are still coupled by a strong Coulomb attraction rather than its dissociation into free charge carriers. Moreover, effective exciton dissociation into free charge carriers is of paramount importance to enhance the improvement of the Jsc and FF. Hence, to gain an in-depth insight into the electronic excitation processes, electron–hole localization and coherence of specific excitations between the spacer and acceptor segments present in the investigated molecular skeletons, two-dimensional transition density matrix (TDM) calculations are carried out using TDDFT methods.38 For this purpose, all the atoms are grouped into several segments such as P1, A and P2 for the investigated molecules and A1, P and A2 for TfIF-4FIC, respectively. Hydrogen atoms are omitted as they have negligible contribution to the charge transfer transitions. The obtained map clearly shows that the excited state transitions of the acceptor molecules are located on the core acceptor unit (PzDP) for all the systems. (Fig. 11) Thus, the brightest zones of the diagonal part represent the local excitation (LE) component of PzDP and the main backbone has a large contribution to the charge transfer transitions. The LE component is found to be more dominant in the case of 1CFPzDP. On the other hand, a little CT component has been noticed between P2 and other segments in 2CF-PzDP and 3F-PzDP, respectively. TDM of A–π–A type TfIF-4FIC shows a distinctly different charge transfer transition which mainly relies on the terminal fluorinated acceptor units, whereas the coefficients are found to be comparatively low over the PzDP based systems. Based on the coefficients related to the interactions between the segments, the presence of hole–electron coherence in the acceptor systems is given in the following order: TfIF-4FIC < 3FPzDP < 1CFPzDP < 2CFPzDP. The obtained results from the TDM map follow a consistent trend with the exciton binding energy. Among the series, the weak coupling between the hole–electron is found in 2CFPzDP that leads to effective exciton dissociation. The obtained results from the TDM map of PzDP based acceptors follow a consistent trend with the exciton binding energy. Surprisingly, exceptional low exciton binding energy of the reference acceptor is mainly attributed to the proper energy level alignment with respect to the donor units. Among the series, weak hole–electron coupling is found in 2CFPzDP that leads to effective exciton dissociation.

Conclusions
In conclusion, in an effort to accelerate the charge mobility of the dyes, we have designed and synthesized three new small molecule NFAs 1CFPzDP, 2CFPzDP, and 3FPzDP containing PzDP as the common central core and (trifluoromethyl)benzene/1,3-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene/1,2,3-trifluorobenzene moieties as end-capping units. The substituents are well-reported to enhance mobility as individuals and combining them is expected to provide a better contribution. The photophysical, electrochemical, and thermal properties of 1CFPzDP, 2CFPzDP, and 3FPzDP were characterized to evaluate their suitability as acceptor materials in BHJOSCs. All the dyes exhibited broad optical absorption and well aligned HOMO/LUMO energy levels with respect to P3HT for BHJOSCs. Fluorescence quenching experiments revealed an efficient charge transfer between the donor material P3HT and the synthesized NFAs. DFT studies showed that the resultant molecules are more planar and the σ-electron withdrawing fluorine atoms have considerable impact on the π-conjugated skeleton. Comparison of the transition characteristics of the designed and reference acceptor systems clearly reveals its distinct charge density difference behavior upon photoexcitation due to their different configurations. Among the series, trifluoromethyl substituted acceptors such as 1CFPzDP and 2CFPzDP possess higher Voc and exciton binding energy with respect to the donors P3HT and PTB7-Th. The synthesized molecules show excellent thermal stability. We believe that the good optical properties, suitable HOMO/LUMO energy levels, and excellent Td values portray them as good candidates as small molecule NFAs for the realization of highly efficient BHJOSCs.
