    , Accepted 19th April 2022First published on 20th April 2022AbstractIndium tin oxide (ITO) is a ubiquitous transparent conducting oxide (TCO) used in various optoelectronic devices, owing to its high optical transmittance and high electrical conductivity. The rarity of indium metal in the earth's crust leads to a significant increase in the production cost of ITO, thereby triggering the quest for novel alternative materials. In this scenario, undoped SnO2 (TO) and Sb (antimony)-doped SnO2 (ATO) large-area thin films have been deposited using a facile cost-effective spray pyrolysis technique, where ATO qualified as an efficient alternative TCO in DSSCs. Intriguingly, the doping of Sb in the SnO2 lattice without structural change leads to an improvement in the properties and performance of DSSCs. The surface of the ATO conductive electrode increases the hydrophilicity due to high surface roughness compared to that of the undoped tin oxide (TO) electrode. A figure of merit of 8.23 × 10−3 Ω−1 with a low sheet resistance value of 12.18 Ω □−1 and a transmittance of 80% at 550 nm was achieved for doped electrodes on par with that of commercial ITO (1.52 × 10−3 Ω−1). Moreover, the ATO conductive electrode shows a lower resistivity of 6.09 × 10−4 Ω cm, higher carrier concentration (6.20 × 1020 cm−3), low mobility (16.49 cm2 V−1 s−1) and thermal stability of the sheet resistance up to 400 °C (sheet resistance = 14 Ω □−1, after thermal treatment) when compared to the undoped TO electrode. The fabricated DSSC using the spray-deposited ATO conductive electrode exhibits a maximum efficiency of 4.05%. These promising results indicate its viability as an efficient alternative TCO electrode for optoelectronic device applications.
1. Introduction
Transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) constitute a class of most significant components in solar cells,1 display devices,2 smart windows,3 sensors,4,5 electrochromic devices,3etc. The optical transparency and electrical conductivity properties are crucial for their use as transparent conducting electrodes in various optoelectronic devices, depending on their range of sheet resistance values.6 However, it is challenging to stabilize both the optical transparency and electrical conductivity in a single host material, and there exists a trade-off between these two essential properties. For example, glass is transparent but insulating in nature, whereas metals are conductive but opaque. Nevertheless, changing the material dimension from bulk to the nanoscale and incorporating suitable dopants can successfully yield efficient transparent conducting properties in the same host material. In 1907, Karl Baedeker7 identified the first TCO material CdO by annealing a sputtered Cd film in air, where incomplete oxidation of Cd turned it into non-stoichiometric CdO, leading to an increase in the electrical conductivity due to the creation of oxygen vacancies. Although the initial performance was not optimal, subsequent investigations have yielded metal-like behaviour in CdO.7 However, the extreme toxicity of Cd has been a major obstacle towards its commercialization for widespread use. Later, Corning laboratories identified (90%) In2O3:(10%) Sn as a potential TCO material in 1930.8 In 1947, Harold McMaster9 patented a chemically deposited SnO2 thin film as a TCO material with optical transmittance and sheet resistance of around 92% and 200 Ω □−1, respectively.10 Tin-doped indium oxide (ITO), a binary TCO material, was commercialized by Rupprecht in 1954.9 To date, this material has been widely used as a transparent conducting electrode in a variety of optoelectronic devices. A few decades ago, due to the intense scarcity of indium metal and a surge in market demand for ITO, researchers began to focus on alternative TCO materials which can supplement ITO. In addition, due to the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic, the gap between the supply and demand for ITO has further widened and intense research work is being carried out in search of alternative TCO materials with excellent optical and electrical properties on par with those of ITO. The optical transparency and electrical conductivity of SnO2 can be increased by doping with suitable dopants such as In,9 Li,11 F,12 Al,13 Mo,14 Mn,15 Co,16 Ta,17 W,18 Nb,19 and Sb.20 Among all these dopants, Sb-doped SnO2 is identified as one of the most promising alternative TCO materials. However, its electrical conductivity and optical transparency are still lower compared to those of ITO. The main impediments of undoped SnO2 for practical applications are its high resistivity (10−2–10−3 Ωcm), low carrier concentration and lower mobility.21 The sheet resistance and mobility of SnO2 depend on the crystalline quality and defect density, which are also influenced by the method of preparation. The enhancement of electrical transport parameters can be achieved by introducing intrinsic defects, including oxygen vacancies, or by introducing extrinsic defects through aliovalent cationic or anionic dopants.22 As a result, the selection of a suitable dopant and process design is very important to enhance its electrical transport properties. The conductivity of SnO2 significantly depends on three critical parameters: (1) the dopant, (2) the synthesis procedure, and (3) the thickness of the oxide layer.23–25 In order to increase the conductivity and achieve a better performance, a donor type dopant may be required. Since the deposition method significantly changes the thin film properties, researchers have explored various techniques such as sputtering,26–31 PLD,32 CVD,33,34 hydrolysis,35 wet chemical deposition,36 sol-gel methods,37 hydrothermal methods38–40 and spray pyrolysis41–48 for the deposition of the Sb-doped SnO2 (ATO) film. Even though several reports exist on Sb-doped SnO2 thin films, the size of the film deposited using spray pyrolysis is generally limited to a very small area. Moreover, there are hardly any reports on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) fabricated using spray-pyrolyzed Sb-doped SnO2 films as electrodes. In the case of SnO2 doped with several donor elements, it is found to exhibit higher optical transmittance and good electrical conductivity. Chen et al. demonstrated the non-thermal dual-plasma synthesis of Sb doped SnO2 (ATO) nanocrystals with a uniform composition and a conductivity of 0.1 S cm−1 over a high surface area.49 The main advantages of ATO include excellent stoichiometric control, 5+ charge state, abundance and low cost (compared to ITO), and ease of cationic ‘Sb’ doping (compared to anionic fluorine doped FTO). However, large-area ATO thin films, especially fabricated by the cost-effective spray pyrolysis method, lack exhaustive exploration; also, studies on the temperature stability of the sheet resistance of ATO films in correlation with the post-annealing conditions for use in DSSCs are lacking in the literature. Recently, the efficiency of DSSCs was enhanced to values exceeding 14% using triarylamine (TAA) based dyes as sensitizers.50 Beomjin et al. reported the advantage of an ATO layer coated over the ITO surface for use as a TCO in DSSCs. Their exploration has given clues about enhancing the efficiency of the device fabricated using an ITO film coated with a 100 nm ATO capping layer, and an improvement in the thermal stability of the electrode up to 500 °C, resulting in an improved efficiency of 6.41% (ITO/ATO/TiO2) compared to that of FTO (5.94%).51 This provides the main motivation for the present work to develop an efficient alternative transparent conducting electrode of large-area ATO using a cost-effective and facile spray pyrolysis technique for use as transparent conducting electrodes in DSSCs. Reports have shown that when SnO2 is doped with a suitable amount of antimony, the films attain favourable electrical conductivity, high transmittance and low reflection in the visible light range. Zheng et al. reported that at 5 wt% Sb doping carrier concentration, the transmittance and mobility greatly improve due to intrinsic defects, such as oxygen vacancies and tin interstitials for donors, and the substitution of tin by antimony at 5 wt% provides vacancies that co-exist in the deposited thin film.52 Lekshmy et al. showed that when doping with 5wt% Sb in SnO2, it decreases the electrical resistivity to the order of 10−5 Ω cm and exhibits good transparency for use in optoelectronic devices.53 As evident from the literature, 5 wt% is the optimal donor concentration for achieving better optical and electrical properties in SnO2. In the present study, undoped SnO2 (TO) and 5 wt% Sb-doped SnO2 thin films of area 5 × 5 cm2 are deposited under optimized conditions using the spray pyrolysis technique.54 The deposited ATO film exhibits reasonably good electrical and optical properties compared to the undoped SnO2 transparent conducting film and is demonstrated as an efficient transparent conducting electrode in DSSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and methods
Analytical grade reagents and chemicals such as SnCl2·2H2O, SbCl5, HCl and ethylene glycol were used as received. Glass substrates were purchased from Zhuhai Kaivo Optoelectronic Technology Co. Ltd and cleaned through ultra-sonication using detergent soap solution, deionized water, IPA, acetone and ethanol in a sequence. TiO2 paste was purchased from Greatcell Solar Materials Pvt. Ltd (Australia) and used as an electron transporting layer (ETL). Acetonitrile, iodine, 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 1-butyl-3 methylimidazolium iodide purchased from Sigma-Aldrich were used without any further purification as a redox couple for photoelectrochemical studies. Chloroplatinic acid (Sigma Aldrich) was used to prepare the counter electrode. A Surlyn spacer (SX1170-60, 60 μm thick from Solaronix) was used for sealing the DSSC device. The spray pyrolysis deposited ATO electrodes were used as transparent conducting electrodes to fabricate the DSSC device. In addition, a reference device was fabricated using standard fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, sheet resistance 10 Ω □−1) conducting electrodes.
2.2. Thin film deposition
A 200 mL solution of 0.5 M concentration was prepared by weighing the necessary quantity of the precursors. SnCl2·2H2O and SbCl2·2H2O were weighed and transferred into two separate beakers filled with 16 mL of double-distilled water and were stirred for 30 min each. A few drops of HCl were added into the above mixture for better solubility and to obtain a transparent solution. These two transparent solutions were then mixed, and 150 mL of ethylene glycol was added and stirred for 3 h to result in a final clear solution. The undoped SnO2 solution was also prepared using the same procedure without the addition of a dopant precursor. After 3 h of stirring, the final mixture was loaded into the spray gun. Glass substrates of area 5 × 5 cm2 (1 mm thickness) were cleaned ultrasonically using a standard cleaning procedure to remove fine dust, grease or oil traces clinging on the surface. The cleaned glass substrates were then blow-dried using nitrogen gas. A high energy plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma, Model PDC-002) was used to neutralize the ionic charge contaminants on the surface of the substrates. Finally, the cleaned glass substrates were loaded into the spray chamber.
The substrate temperature was ramped up to 420 °C in 90 min. A double-walled glass spray gun with a tapered inner nozzle of diameter 0.3 mm was used for film deposition, and the distance between the substrate holder and the spray gun was fixed at 35 cm. The compressed air pressure was maintained at 30 kg cm−2, the spray duration was 0.5 sec with an interval of 30 sec, and a total of 650 sprays were performed for both the films using 200 mL of the undoped and Sb-doped precursor solutions, respectively. The undoped SnO2 and Sb-doped SnO2 thin films are labelled as TO and ATO, respectively.
DSSC devices were fabricated in a standard architecture using the TO and ATO thin films as transparent conducting electrodes. The reference device was fabricated using a commercially available FTO electrode to compare the device performance. The fabricated device architectures for TO, ATO and FTO are TO/TiO2/N719 dye + electrolyte/Pt/TO, ATO/TiO2/N719 dye + electrolyte/Pt/ATO and FTO/TiO2/N719 dye + electrolyte/Pt/FTO, respectively. The transparent conductive substrates were cleaned once again using the previously described standard cleaning procedure and additionally treated with UV-O3 to remove any organic contaminants.
2.3. Dye-sensitized solar cell fabrication
Commercial TiO2 paste was coated over the cleaned TO, ATO and FTO conductive substrates using a doctor-blade technique,55 followed by sintering at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the TO, ATO and FTO substrates were treated with pre-prepared 0.04 M TiCl4 for 30 min at 80 °C to obtain a highly porous layer. The treated electrodes were then rinsed with deionized water and calcined at 450 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the porous TiO2 films were immersed into 0.5 mM N719 dye solution and sensitized for 6 h. To fill the electrolyte solution, two fine holes were drilled from the rear side of the counter electrode. The front side of the drilled electrode was coated with 5 mM chloroplatinic acid using a drop-cast method.56 The coated films were calcined at 450 °C for 30 min in air. The photoanode and the Pt-coated counter electrode were sandwiched using a Surlyn® polymer spacer as a hot melt sealing foil. The iodide-based liquid electrolyte was injected from the counter electrode side through the drilled holes using a micropipette. After filling the electrolyte, the holes on the counter electrode side were sealed using a Surlyn® spacer and a piece of a thin glass coverslip.
2.4. Characterization methods
The structural properties were analyzed using a Rigaku SmartLab automated multipurpose X-ray diffractometer with CuKα radiation of λ = 1.5406 Å. The oxidation states of the deposited thin films were confirmed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Model: ESCA 3400, Make: Kratos/Shimadzu Amicus). The optical properties were studied using a UV-visible spectrometer (Analytek Jena, SPECORD 210 PLUS). The surface morphology and topology of the thin films were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (Hitachi, S-4300SE) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements (Park Systems, NX10). The thickness measurements were performed using a stylus profilometer (Model: DektakXT, Bruker). Photoluminescence emission spectra were recorded using a Horiba Jobin Yvon Flourolog-3-21 spectrofluorometer (a 450 W xenon arc lamp) with an excitation wavelength of 325 nm at room temperature. The contact angle measurements were performed using a DSA25 Drop Shape Analyzer (KRUSS, Germany). The electrical transport properties were measured using linear four-probe and Hall effect (Ecopia, HMS 3000) techniques. The surface work function at room temperature was measured using a Kelvin Probe instrument (KP Technologies APS04). The measurement results are reproducible within the allowed experimental error. The J–V characteristics of the fabricated DSSCs were measured under one sun illumination at AM 1.5 G standards (a Class AAA simulator, Oriel Instruments). The photoelectrochemical impedance measurements were performed in the frequency range of 100 mHz to 100 kHz using a Solartron SI – 1260 impedance analyzer.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural and elemental analyses

Fig. 1(a) shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of TO and ATO thin films. The XRD patterns of the TO and ATO films show high crystallinity with peaks corresponding to the tetragonal crystal structure. The peaks of TO and ATO thin films are well-matched with JCPDS file: 41-1445. There are no other peaks related to Sb2O3, Sb2O5, SnO or SnO3, which is evidence for the successful incorporation of the Sb dopant as a substitutional impurity into the SnO2 host lattice at the ‘Sn’ sites. The lattice constants of the TO and ATO films are estimated using eqn (1). (1)where a and c are lattice parameters, h, k, and l are the Miller indices, and d is the lattice spacing.

(f) Absorption spectra and (g) transmittance spectra in comparison with commercial FTO. (h) Bandgap estimation from the Tauc plots of the spray-deposited TO and ATO thin films. 
The estimated values are found to be a = b = 4.738 Å and c = 3.185 Å for TO and a = b = 4.741 Å and c = 3.185 Å for ATO. These values are nearly equal to those given in the standard JCPDS file No.: 41-1445 (a = b = 4.738 Å and c = 3.187 Å) of SnO2. The minor variation in the lattice parameters of the ATO film is related to the difference in the ionic radii of Sn4+ (69 pm) and Sb5+ (60 pm). The average crystallite size values of the TO and ATO films are calculated using eqn (2) and are found to be 58.25 and 37.48 nm, respectively. (2)where D is the crystallite size, K is the shape factor, λ is the wavelength of the X-rays, β is the full width at half maximum in radians, and θ is the diffraction angle.
The main peaks in the SnO2 JCPDS file No.: 41-1445 with higher intensities are (110), (101) and (211). In the spray-deposited TO and ATO films, the (110) peak is observed to be dominant, whereas the (101) and (211) peaks are suppressed. Notably, the (200) peak is observed to possess a significant intensity. It is observed from Fig. 1(a) that the growth of the TO and ATO films is preferred along the (110) and (200) planes. The texture coefficient TChkl represents the texture of a particular plane, and its deviation from unity implies preferred growth. TChkl is calculated using eqn (3) as follows: (3)where Ihkl is the measured intensity of the X-ray reflection, I0hkl is the standard intensity of the same reflection, and N is the total number of reflections observed in the XRD patterns of the films. The estimated TChkl values corresponding to (110) and (200) planes are 2.69 and 1.54 for the ATO film; and 2.09 and 2.02 for the TO film, respectively. From the inset of Fig. 1(a), a slight shift observed in the (110) peak position from 26.58° to 26.51° represents the substitution of Sb ions at the ‘Sn’ sites of the SnO2 lattice. The textured growth results from reorientation effects induced by Sb ions being incorporated into the Sn lattice sites due to subtle variation in spray dynamics.

Fig. 1(b) shows the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) survey spectrum of the ATO thin film. The full scan indicates the presence of constituent elements Sn, Sb and O, in addition to a carbon contamination peak at 285 eV due to exposure to ambient air.57 In Fig. 1(c), the main characteristic binding energy of oxygen O1s is 530.73 eV which is shifted slightly towards a higher energy of 531.5 eV. From Fig. 1(d), it is observed that the binding energy peaks at around 540.5 eV and 531.5 eV corresponding to Sb 3d3/2 and Sb 3d5/2 states respectively, thereby confirming the existence of Sb in the 5+ charge state. This is also implied by the significant improvement in free carrier concentration with Sb dopant content. From Fig. 1(e), the peaks at 495.2 eV and 486.7 eV corresponds to the Sn 3d3/2 and Sn 3d5/2 states respectively, indicating that the Sn atoms are in the 4+ charge state. The difference in the binding energy between these two oxidation states is 8.5 eV, consistent with the values reported in the literature.17,57–59 The 4+ valence state of ‘Sn’ covalently bonds with the pentavalent Sb donor atom, yielding a free electron to the lattice. The XPS results are well-matched with the data available in the literature.57,58
3.2. Optical transmittance and band gap estimation

Fig. 1(f) shows the absorbance (TO and ATO) and Fig. 1(g) shows the transmittance spectra comparing the TO, ATO, and commercial FTO thin films. The bandgap estimation of the films from the Tauc plots is shown in Fig. 1(h). Greater absorption and slightly lower transmittance (80% at 550 nm) of light are observed for Sb doping into the SnO2 lattice. The reason behind this may be as follows: in the case of the TO film, there are no dopants; but in the case of the ATO film, Sb acts as a substitutional dopant, forming defect levels, thereby leading to the formation of a grey tinge (due to the 5+ charge state of Sb). In addition, the increased surface roughness, variation in film thickness, and subtle deviation in the growth pattern of the film can also contribute to the reduction in optical transmittance. The thickness measured for the ATO film (500 nm) is higher than that for the TO film (300 nm) (Table 1). Doping with Sb causes a decrease in the optical band gap (Eg) from 3.87 eV to 3.82 eV [Fig. 1(h)]. In the literature, Sb doping in SnO2 is reported to widen the band gap by the Burstein-Moss shift.60–62 However, a decrease in the bandgap is also reported in the case of appropriately doped degenerate SnO2, which has been explained based on the effective mass of the carriers.63

3.3. Surface morphology, contact angle measurement and chemical composition analysis

Fig. 2(a and b) show the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of the TO and ATO thin films, respectively. Fig. 2(b) clearly shows a tetragonal morphology with nearly uniform-sized particles. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis is performed to estimate the chemical composition of ATO thin film electrodes. The results indicate the presence of constituent elements in the desired percentage (Fig. S1, ESI†).

To investigate the surface wettability of the TO and ATO thin films, the contact angle of water droplets on their surfaces is measured as shown in Fig. 2(c and d), respectively. These measurements indicate that the contact angle of the water droplet on the surface of the ATO film (89.6°) decreases in comparison with that of the undoped TO film (94.0°), resulting in improvement of the hydrophilicity of the film with Sb-doping. This behaviour substantiates the Wenzel equation given as follows:64 cosθw = rwcosθY(4)where θW and θY are Wenzel's contact angle (measured) and Young's contact angle (for the ideal surface), respectively. rw is Wenzel's roughness factor defined as the ratio of the actual area of a rough surface to the geometric projected area. As observed in the AFM images, the surface roughness of the ATO thin film is higher than that of the undoped TO film. In accordance with the Wenzel equation, the higher surface roughness of the ATO film leads to a decrease in contact angle, implying hydrophilic nature.65

Fig. 2(e, f) and (g, h) depict the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) AFM images of the TO and ATO thin film electrodes, respectively. The surface morphology of both the films appears to be dense, indicating the good quality of the films; the calculated RMS surface roughness values of the TO and ATO films are 18 nm and 45 nm, respectively (Table 1). The increase in surface roughness reveals that the addition of the Sb element in the SnO2 lattice leads to defects and variation in the grain orientation and growth, resulting in the high density of grain boundaries.66
Grain boundaries are known to play a critical role in carrier mobility which significantly influences the electrical resistance of thin films.67 The increase in RMS surface roughness with an increase in doping concentration is reported in the literature.68–70 A rough surface predominantly enhances the reflection of incident photons back into the electrode, thereby decreasing the loss of photons and aiding the improvement in light gathering ability.16,71
3.4. Photoluminescence measurements

Fig. 3(a) shows the photoluminescence (PL) emission spectra of the spray-deposited TO and ATO thin films. The excitation wavelength for both the thin films is 330 nm. From Fig. 3(a), it is observed that the peak corresponding to ultraviolet emission is located at around 393 nm, and, upon deconvolution of this broad peak, two additional sub-bands situated at 368 nm and 454 nm within the envelope are evident. The peak at 393 nm represents the near-band-edge (NBE) emission of electrons from the bottom of the conduction band to the top of the valence band.72 The other two minor emission peaks are at 546 nm and 634 nm, attributed to the oxygen vacancy defects present in the films.73–75

(d and e) Variation in the sheet resistance of the TO and ATO thin films as a function of annealing temperature for 30 min duration and (f) photographs of the spray-deposited TO and ATO thin films. 
The most common defects in metal oxides are oxygen vacancies (VO) which act as luminescent centres. VO0, VO+, and VO2+ are the well-known oxygen vacancy states,76 where Vo0 is a shallow donor near the conduction band. The other most common oxygen vacancies are likely to exist in the VO+ charge state and will change to the VO2+ state upon recombining with a hole, leading to blue and green emission.77 The substitution of Sb at the SnO2 lattice forms defect energy levels near the conduction band, and these defects play a vital role in creating luminescent centres. The oxygen vacancy point defect density can be calculated from Smakula's formula78 (5)where n = 2 is the refractive index of SnO2, F = 1 is the oscillator strength of the optical transmission, and αW1/2 is the Gaussian area of the PL emission peak. The calculated oxygen vacancy point defect density is 1.57 × 1023 cm−3 for the ATO film and is one order of magnitude higher than that of the undoped TO film (2.7 × 1022 cm−3). This increase is eventually due to the Sb-doping which induces an increase in oxygen vacancies.
3.5. Electrical transport properties and thermal stability of the sheet resistance
The electrical transport properties of the deposited TO and ATO thin films were measured using the Hall effect at room temperature, and both the films are found to possess n-type electrical conductivity. The carrier concentration (nc), resistivity (ρ) and mobility (μe) values are given in Table 2 in comparison with ITO from the literature. The ATO film shows a low resistivity (6.09 × 10−4 Ω cm) compared to that of the TO film (4.66 × 10−3 Ω cm). The dopant Sb has the 5+ charge state, in which four electrons form bonds with neighbouring oxygen atoms, and the remaining electron is donated as a free carrier to the lattice, thereby contributing to the increase in free charge carrier concentration. In the case of undoped SnO2, there are limited free charge carriers (due to the absence of donor elements and the presence of relatively fewer defects) since Sn has the 4+ charge state without free electron donation, leading to high resistivity compared to that of the Sb-doped SnO2 thin film. The increase in free carriers through Sb-doping and the presence of excess oxygen vacancies are the main causes for the increase in the electrical conductivity of the ATO film, and this is evident from the increase in its carrier concentration (6.20 × 1020 cm−3) and defect density (1.57 × 1023 cm−3). However, the reduction in mobility may be due to inter-carrier collisions, owing to the presence of excess charge carriers and scattering by lattice defects. Fig. 3(b and c) show the 3D contour mapping of the sheet resistance (Rs) of the deposited TO and ATO thin films over 5 × 5 cm2 area. The observed variation in sheet resistance is because of the inherent deviation in spray dynamics, which depends on several parameters like the spray solution flow rate, gas pressure, concentration of the solution, and distance from the spray nozzle to the substrate as well as substrate temperature.

The pressure of the spray solution varies from the centre of the film to its edges due to the usage of the single nozzle spray gun. As a result, the central portion of the film represents low sheet resistance (violet color) compared to that at the edges (red color). From Fig. 3(b and c), one can observe that the average Rs value (light blue colour) of the undoped TO film is very high (255.48 Ω □−1), whereas the ATO film shows a significantly lower average Rs value of 12.18 Ω □−1. The reduced sheet resistance is attributed to the increase in charge carrier concentration upon doping Sb5+ into the SnO2 lattice and also due to the oxygen vacancies, as discussed earlier.
The thermal stability of the sheet resistance is a crucial parameter for analyzing the suitability of the TO and ATO thin films in various device applications. Ideally, the sheet resistance must be consistent even at high processing temperatures. The thermal stability of the sheet resistance of the TO and ATO films is investigated by varying the annealing temperature (150 °C to 500 °C in steps of 50 °C), and the resulting change in Rs is measured using a linear four-probe setup.

Fig. 3(d and e) show the variation in the Rs values measured for the TO and ATO films as a function of annealing temperature at every 50 °C, sintered for 30 min in the range from 150 °C to 500 °C. For the TO film, Rs is nearly stable (277 Ω □−1–331 Ω □−1) up to 350 °C without any significant increase. At 400 °C, Rs increases to three times its initial value (i.e., to 877 Ω □−1). Above 400 °C, there is a rapid increase in Rs at 450 °C and 500 °C, and it reaches a maximum value by an eight-fold increase (2369 Ω □−1) compared to its initial value. In the case of the ATO film, Rs is stable up to 350 °C without significant variation (=12 Ω □−1 to 14 Ω □−1). At 400 °C, the value of Rs doubles, and, at 500 °C, there is a substantial five-fold increase (67 Ω □−1) compared to the initial Rs value. Fig. 3(f) shows the photographs of the spray-deposited TO and ATO thin films.
The overall comparison indicates that the ATO film has better resistance stability with temperature than that of the TO film without drastic changes up to 400 °C. Whereas, in the case of TO film, the Rs value increases drastically from 350 °C to 500 °C (eight-fold increase), which decreases upon doping with Sb; and the thermal stability of Rs is enhanced up to 400 °C, with only a five-fold increase in its initial value. Compared to the TO film, the ATO film has a relatively lower increase in Rs value which may be due to the following factors: (a) thermally activated free carriers may lead to the optimal carrier concentration that helps in maintaining the stability of the sheet resistance up to 400 °C and (b) free charge carriers are scattered by oxygen vacancy defects and grain boundaries.80,81 This study indicates the improvement in the thermal stability and electrical conductivity of the ATO film due to Sb-doping. The figure of merit (FoM) values related to the optical transmittance and sheet resistance are estimated from the Haacke formula82 for the TO and ATO films, and the values are given in Table 2. The ATO film shows a five-fold increase in the FoM value (8.23 × 10−3 Ω−1) when compared to that of the TO film (1.52 × 10−3 Ω−1), which is mainly due to the significant decrease in sheet resistance.
3.6. Surface work function
In optoelectronic devices, the work function plays an important role in their performance and efficiency. The work function (Φ) of the TO and ATO films was measured using Kelvin probe microscopy (KP Technologies APS04) operated in air with a 2 mm gold alloy tip. Initially, the Au tip is calibrated with a standard gold-coated aluminium substrate (whose Φ is known) by measuring the contact potential difference (CPD) between the gold film and the tip. The ΦTip for this experiment is estimated to be 4970.56 ± 10.22 meV. Then, the deposited thin film is loaded and the CPD between the sample and the tip is measured. The CPD is measured for a total of 400 points in the area of 3.5 × 3.5 mm2 and the 2D contour mapping of TO and ATO thin films is shown in Fig. 4(a and b).
 Fig. 4  2D contour map of the surface work function of the (a) TO and (b) ATO thin films measured over a 3.5 × 3.5 mm2 area. 
The work function of a semiconductor can be defined as the difference between the Fermi energy level position and the vacuum level (ϕ = Evac − EF).83 The measured average work function values of the spray-pyrolyzed TO and ATO films are found to be 4.66 eV and 4.82 eV, respectively. For undoped SnO2, the surface work function values are reported in the range from 4.4 eV to 5.7 eV.84 The work function of SnO2 can be tuned with effective dopants such as Sb, F, etc. However, ATO possesses a slightly higher surface work function than the standard ITO and FTO films which are reported to be in the range of 4.3–4.4 eV.85–94 The surface roughness, preferred orientation and oxygen stoichiometry of a thin film of a degenerate semiconductor also affect its surface work function.80,95 Zhao et al. and Centurioni et al. reported the role of the surface work function of TCOs in the performance of amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction solar cells studied by computer simulation.96,97 Low work function electrodes are preferred for many of the inorganic/organic devices to inject or collect electrons from the conduction band minima (CBM)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Although ATO possesses a slightly higher surface work function than that of ITO and FTO, it still falls within the range reported in the literature and can be employed in some specific optoelectronic device requirements, wherever necessary.
3.7. Dye-sensitized solar cells and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are fabricated using the spray-pyrolyzed TO and ATO electrodes as well as the commercially available FTO electrode; the respective device architectures are (i) ATO (or TO)/TiO2/N719 dye + electrolyte/Pt/ATO (or TO) and (ii) FTO/TiO2/N719 dye + electrolyte/Pt/FTO as shown in Fig. 5(a). The DSSC device fabricated using the undoped TO electrode (denoted as DTO) exhibits poor performance (the inset of Fig. 5b), owing to its higher sheet resistance and poor electrical transport properties. Hence, only the J–V curves (under AM 1.5 G solar illumination) for the DSSCs fabricated using the ATO and FTO electrodes (DATO and DFTO, respectively) are compared as shown in Fig. 5(b). Their corresponding photovoltaic efficiency (η) values are given in Table 3 in comparison with that of an ITO-based device (DITO) from the literature. In DSSCs, well-established transparent conducting FTO electrodes are used since they are thermally stable up to 650 °C98 and hence suitable for sustaining the electrical and optical properties without the change due to thermal processes involved in preparing the electrodes for DSSCs at 500 °C. Tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) is expected to be better than FTO because of its superior transparency and electrical conductivity.99 However, ITO is not suitable for DSSC applications because its conductivity decreases enormously during the thermal process, leading to a significant reduction in DSSC conversion efficiency. Sima et al. studied the comparison of the resistivity and thermal stability of ITO and FTO electrodes for DSSC application.100 The resistivity value of ITO increased after the thermal treatment (at 450 °C for 2 hours) to 52 Ω □−1, while that of FTO remained unchanged (12 Ω □−1).100 For comparison, the performance of a DSSC fabricated using an ITO electrode from the literature alongside FTO and ATO of the present work is shown in Table 3.

For the device DATO, the Voc is 0.69 V and Jsc is 9.16 mA cm−2 with η of 4.05%. However, for the standard device DFTO, Voc and Jsc show a significant increase to 0.77 V and 12.38 mA cm−2, respectively, with an efficiency of 7.22%. The sheet resistance of commercially available FTO (Zhuhai Kaivo Optoelectronic Technology Co. Ltd) is around 10–13 Ω □−1 and the optical transmittance is about 85% at 550 nm, whereas the deposited ATO thin film has an average sheet resistance of 12.18 Ω □−1 and a transmittance of 80% at 550 nm. Factors such as lower transparency, higher surface roughness and higher work function of the ATO film led to a relatively lower efficiency in DATO compared to that of the DFTO device. The lower transmittance of the ATO film (see Fig. 1g) leads to a comparatively lower number of incident photons for power conversion by DATO. Likewise, the surface of the ATO film deposited by spray pyrolysis is in general rough compared to the commercially available FTO electrode which influences the contact resistance between the ATO and the TiO2 layers. In addition to these, the thermal stability of ATO is also slightly lower than that of the commercial FTO, and hence, there is an increase in its sheet resistance to 51 Ω □−1 at 450 °C (Fig. 3e). This leads to a decrease in the charge collection properties and transport of electrons in the ATO electrode. This may be the reason for the observed lower photocurrent density and power conversion efficiency of the device DATO compared to those of DFTO. The semi-log plots corresponding to the J–V characteristics measured under AM 1.5 G solar illumination are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†).
A substantial reduction in the forward bias photocurrent is observed for the device DATO when compared to DFTO. However, the reduction in the reverse leakage current is not that drastic. Fig. 5(c) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of DATO and DFTO devices, where a higher EQE (60%) is observed for DFTO compared to that of DATO (35%). However, to achieve a higher power conversion efficiency for the DSSC fabricated using the ATO electrode, the sheet resistance, optical transmittance, and surface work function of ATO thin films should be improved by varying the deposition parameters and/or by altering the composition of the dopant element.
To obtain information about the frequency-dependent photoelectrochemical mechanism and charge transport properties, the devices DATO and DFTO are investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The depiction of the real (Zre) and imaginary (Zim) parts of the complex impedance of the devices DATO and DFTO (for comparison) as a function of the frequency is presented in Fig. 5(d) (Nyquist plot). The equivalent circuit is shown in the inset of Fig. 5(d) and the corresponding parameters (shown in Table 3) are obtained from the Nyquist plot.
The high-frequency intercept on the real axis of the Nyquist plot represents the series resistance (Rseries) of the respective electrodes, Rct1 is the interfacial charge carrier transfer resistance between the photoanode and electrolyte, and Rct2 is the interfacial charge carrier transfer resistance between the counter electrode and electrolyte for the I−/I3− redox reaction. The resistance (Rseries) of the device DATO (60.93 Ω) is higher than that of the reference device DFTO (17.91 Ω) which affects the collection of charge carriers, leading to a relatively lower photocurrent density in DATO.
The DATO and DFTO devices exhibit two semicircles as indicated in Fig. 5(d) (the inset is the equivalent circuit and enlarged images of the smaller semicircles of DFTO and DATO). For the device DFTO, the semicircle in the low-frequency region (0.1–100 Hz) indicates the charge carrier transport resistance (Rct1 = 15.11 Ω) at the photoanode–electrolyte interface. In the higher frequency region (100 kHz to 1 MHz), the relatively larger semicircle indicates the charge transfer resistance (Rct2 = 2.3 Ω) at the electrolyte–counter electrode interface.
For the device DATO, the semicircle in the low-frequency region corresponds to high electrical resistance (Rct1 = 23.61 Ω), which may justify its comparatively lower power conversion efficiency. The charge transfer resistance (Rct2 = 7.17 Ω) at the counter electrode–electrolyte interface (counter electrode–redox I−/I3−couple) is depicted by a larger semicircle in the higher frequency region, and this may influence the ability of the counter electrode to collect charge carriers. The electron lifetime (τe) corresponds to the relaxation processes affected by the electrical conduction mechanism in the devices. The τe values determined from the Bode plot (Fig. S3, ESI†) are 39.97 μs for the device DATO and 25.22 μs for the device DFTO. Although the efficiency of DATO (4.05%) is lower than that of DFTO (7.22%), for an alternative transparent conducting electrode, its performance is highly promising.
Conclusions
The deposition of a 5 wt% Sb-doped SnO2 thin film as an alternative transparent conducting electrode is demonstrated using the facile spray pyrolysis method. The successful doping of Sb into the SnO2 lattice is confirmed by its unaltered structural properties. The XPS spectra reveal the existence of Sb and Sn in 5+ and 4+ charge states, respectively. FE-SEM micrographs show a tetragonal morphology with twisted metal sheet-like features. In corroboration with the surface roughness of the ATO film, the contact angle measurements indicate improved hydrophilic nature. The optical transmittance of the ATO film (80% at 550 nm) is lower than that of the undoped TO film (91% at 550 nm). However, it possesses a low average sheet resistance of 12.18 Ω □−1 and a high carrier concentration of 6.20 × 1020 cm−3 compared to the undoped SnO2 film. A higher oxygen defect density of 1.57 × 1023 c−3 is observed for the ATO film due to Sb-doping in comparison with the undoped TO (2.7 × 1022 cm−3) film. The ATO film exhibits thermal stability of the sheet resistance up to 400 °C. In the present study, the deposited ATO thin film shows a high figure of merit of 8.23 × 10−3 Ω−1 due to the low sheet resistance value compared to that of the TO film. The performance of the DSSC fabricated using the deposited ATO electrode is compared with that of a reference device fabricated using commercially available FTO. Although the FTO-based DSSC shows a higher efficiency of 7.22% than the spray-deposited ATO-based DSSC, the efficiency obtained from this device is reasonably good (4.05%) and has a bright scope for improvement. The present study indicates that the ATO electrode is a reliable and promising candidate, showing reasonably good properties including the surface work function for its use as an alternative TCO in optoelectronic applications. The key outcome of the present work is the successful development of an efficient alternative transparent conducting electrode which remains stable even at very high processing temperatures (400 °C), thereby paving the way for its extended use in several domains of the optoelectronic industry. The performance can be improved by further exploration and comprehensive analysis, either by varying the deposition parameters/dopant concentration and/or by performing certain post-annealing treatments under specific atmospheric conditions.
