Herein, two novel pyrene–carbazole dyes bearing single bond (PC1) and double bond (PC2) linkers and cyano-acrylic acid as an acceptor were synthesized. The dye with a double bond spacer (PC2) in the presence of CDCA achieved an improved power conversion efficiency of 6.30% with a short circuit current of 11.59 mA cm−2, open circuit potential (VOC) of 0.80 V, and a fill factor of 0.68 under standard global AM 1.5G solar conditions. Cyclic voltammetry and density functional theory studies indicate that the incorporation of two donors improved the ease of oxidation of the dyes, which resulted in a high VOC. Despite having a rigid single bond, the charge transfer of the PC1 dye is found to be poor, which affected the photovoltaic performance. The dihedral angle measured at each joint of the optimized dye indicated that PC2 exhibits excellent intramolecular charge transfer due to the near planarity in the structure. Besides, the high electron lifetime in the excited state of PC2 makes it the best performer among the three dyes studied.
1. Introduction
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are one of the most promising third-generation photovoltaic (PV) technologies, and they have remained as an important field of research for more than two decades, beginning with Gratzel's invention of DSSC in 1991.1,2 Recently, DSSCs have outperformed most other long-established PV technologies under ambient light conditions and the best power conversion efficiency (PCE) reached up to 14.3% on the laboratory scale.3,4 Researchers in the field of DSSCs have mainly focused on the four core components of the device: dye/sensitizer, semiconductor metal oxide, counter electrode and redox electrolyte. Despite many years of research, considerable efforts are still being made to find appropriate alternative materials for each of these components. Among the various components, visible light-responsive sensitizers are attractive candidates to realize DSSC, as they are required to inject electrons into the wide bandgap semiconductor metal oxide. With a history of over thirty years of development, a large number of sensitizers have been synthesized and they are classified into three main categories: (i) ruthenium polypyridyl complexes,5–7 (ii) porphyrin complexes,8 and (iii) metal-free organic dyes,9 with the best-reported PCE of these being 11.5%, 13%, and 14.3%, respectively. Compared to the first two categories of dyes, which are tedious to prepare, affected by the scarcity of the precious metal and low-throughput synthesis pathway, the latter is easy to synthesize with ample molecular engineering strategies.10–12 The traditional design of a sensitizer is the simple rod-like donor-π-acceptor (D-π-A) configuration, and a recent report shows that it remains more promising than complex donor–acceptor structures.13 It has been observed in the literature that the design strategy for metal-free organic dyes are based on highly fused and heterocyclic aromatic moieties as donors,14,15 rigid and planar π-spacers16 and strong electron-accepting units.17,18 It is clear that the donor group of the organic dye has a pivotal role in enhancing the PCE as it improves the light-harvesting properties and adjusts the energy levels of the dyes.19
Among the aryl amine heterocyclic chromophores, carbazole is considered as a strong electron-donor system due to its unique rigid and planar configuration, excellent structural and thermal stability, and electron-richness which allow it to be part of the materials for optoelectronic applications20 and organic photovoltaic cells,21 such as DSSCs.22,23 Wang et al., have studied the hexylthiophene-functionalized carbazole dyes and obtained a PCE of 8.3%.24 El-shafei et al., reported a PCE of 9.37% for two heteroleptic Ru(II) isomers with a carbazole antenna, which has outperformed the standard N719 (8.17%) dye.25 Recently, Qian et al., reported indolo [3,2-b] carbazole-based dye with 8.09% efficiency.26 Maddala et al. used carbazole-based small molecules as hole transport materials for perovskite solar cells.27 Furthermore, a large number of carbazole-based dyes show good PCE in DSSCs, a notable one being ADEKA-1 with a PCE of 10.4%.28
Pyrene is another popular polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and its derivatives have been studied extensively as emissive materials in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),29 hole-transport materials in perovskite solar cells (HTM)30 and DSSCs, because of their extensive electron delocalization, high fluorescence quantum yield, long-lived excited-state, good thermal stability and multiple substitution sites.31 The first report on a pyrene based dye (N,N – dialkyl amine linked pyrene with thiophene linker and cyano-acrylic acid acceptor) exhibited a short circuit photocurrent density (JSC) of 12.1 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.71 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.71, corresponding to an overall PCE of 6.1% under AM 1.5 conditions.32 Later, Lu et al., reported the best efficient pyrene-conjugated porphyrin dye with an overall PCE of 8.7%.33 A recent report on pyrene by Khamrang et al., who studied two π-linkers, furan and ethynyl furan, with a pyrene core, showed a PCE of 1.89% and 2.47%, respectively.34
As far as we know, there are no studies on the pyrene–carbazole combo-based dye for DSSCs. Therefore, the motive of this study is to gain a better understanding of the structure–property relationships of pyrene–carbazole systems. To this end, we have developed two new pyrene–carbazole based organic dyes, wherein they are connected by a single bond (PC1) or double bond (PC2) linkage (π-spacer), with cyano-acrylic acid as the acceptor. Pyrene cyano-acrylic acid dye was used as a reference (PC0) for comparison.35 The incorporation of the double bond spacer (PC2), between the pyrene and carbazole moieties, would extend the conjugation while maintaining planarity with pyrene as well as carbazole. It is expected that these two donors will extend the conjugation and adjust the energy levels so that both JSC and VOC can be improved. Our previous work had shown that the planar and rigid geometric donors exhibit a much better PCE than the flexible moieties due to reduced energy loss during vibrational relaxation.36 Recently, Zhang et al., have reported two triazatruxene-based sensitizers, with one containing a double bond spacer, and another a rigid single bond one, and found that the latter provided a rapid electron injection and small vibrational relaxation resulting in the enhancement of PCE.37
The main aspiration of this study with PC1 and PC2 is to understand the effect of mode of linkage (single vs. double bond), between the pyrene and carbazole donors, on the PCE of the dye (Fig. 1). An octyl group is attached at the carbazole nitrogen to impart a hydrophobic environment around the donor, improve the dye-solubility, and reduce the dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface. Theoretical studies were carried out to explore the intra-molecular charge transport (ICT) process involved in these dyes. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations were also carried out to comprehend the electronic structure of these dyes.

The solvents used for photophysical studies were HPLC grade. Laboratory grade solvents were purchased from Rankem chemicals and used without further purification. Dimethylformamide (DMF) and dichloromethane (DCM) were distilled with calcium hydride, whereas tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were distilled in the presence of sodium and benzophenone under a nitrogen atmosphere immediately prior to use. All reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using silica gel plates. Titania (TiO2) paste (18NR-T), fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω cm−2, and a thickness of 2.2 mm (MS001695-10), and a hot-melt sealing agent (MS004610-10, 60 μm thick thermoplastic film) were purchased from Dyesol Ltd, Australia. Silica gel (Rankem, spherical, 100–200 mesh) was used as a stationary phase for column chromatography.
2.2. Characterizations
All 1H NMR (500, 400 MHz) and 13C NMR (125, 100 MHz) spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance NMR spectrometer in either CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 with tetramethyl silane as an internal standard. 1H NMR spectra were referenced to CDCl3 (7.26 ppm) and DMSO – d6 (2.5 ppm) central lines, while 13C NMR was referenced to CDCl3 (77.16 ppm) and DMSO – d6 (39.5 ppm) central lines. The multiplicity is given as, s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, dd = doublet of doublet, qui = quintet, m = multiplet while the coupling constant, J is reported in Hz. The melting point of the dye was measured by packing dye in an open capillary tube on a melting point apparatus and was uncorrected. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained using a JASCO FTIR-4100 spectrometer with KBr cell. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained using a micromass-quad time of flight (MICRO-Q TOF) mass spectrometer coupled with the electrospray ionization (ESI) technique at 10 eV. The solution state absorption spectra of dyes were recorded in a 1 cm path length quartz cell using a JASCO V-650 UV-visible spectrophotometer. Emission spectra of dyes were measured using a JASCO FP-6300 spectrofluorimeter. Cyclic voltammetric studies and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out using a Metrohm Autolab 302N potentiostat/galvanostat having FRA32M module controlled by NOVA 2.1.3 software. The EIS analysis has been carried out at VOC over the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with 10 mV perturbation under 1 sun illumination and the fitting was performed using the ZSimWin 3.6 software. The electrochemical experiments were performed in a three-electrode set up with a 5 mm diameter glassy carbon disc electrode (GCE) (working electrode), Pt mesh counter electrode, and Ag/AgNO3 (0.01 M) in 0.1 M TBAPF6 in acetonitrile (ACN) solvent as the reference electrode. GCE was polished using alumina powder (0.05 μ) before use. The dye was dissolved in dry DCM solvent, and 0.1 M TBAPF6 was added as a supporting electrolyte. The solution was then purged with nitrogen gas for 5 min to eliminate dissolved oxygen. The cyclic voltammogram (CV) was recorded at room temperature at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The photovoltaic performance (current density vs. voltage, J–V) of the prepared DSSCs were measured under one sun condition using a LOT technologies solar simulator fitted with a 150 W Xenon lamp and air mass (AM) 1.5 global filter providing a light power of 100 mW cm−2. A silicon solar cell (type RC2-1010, SN: 0520160006, SPD laboratory) was used to calibrate the spectral intensity of the solar simulator. Except for the active area of the cell, the remaining portion was covered with a black mask to avoid reflected light entering the system.
2.3. Molecular design and synthesis
The synthetic approach used to prepare the pyrene–carbazole dyes (named as PC0, PC1, and PC2) is outlined in Scheme 1. The reference PC0 dye has been synthesized by a single-step Knoevenagel condensation of pyrene aldehyde (2) with cyano-acetic acid (Scheme S1, ESI†). Compound (6) was the common building block for PC1 and PC2 dye, which was synthesized by a nucleophilic substitution reaction of 1-bromooctane, followed by Vilsmeier-Haack formylation reaction and iodination reaction. 1-Vinyl pyrene (3), which is another building block used in the formation of PC2 dye and is obtained by a two-step process. The first step is the formation of pyrene aldehyde (2) followed by its reaction with methyltriphenyl phosphonium iodide (CH3PPh3I) to yield 1-vinyl pyrene. Compounds (6) and (7) are combined via the Suzuki coupling reaction to get compound (8), whereas compound (6) and (3) were combined by a Heck coupling reaction to afford compound (9). Finally, Knoevenagel condensation is carried out to the corresponding aldehydes (8) and (9) for obtaining the target dyes (PC1 and PC2). The desired final products (PC0, PC1, PC2) were obtained in good yields and were well-characterized by NMR, FT-IR, and HRMS techniques (Fig. S1–S6, ESI†).

2.6. DSSC fabrication
FTO conducting plates were cleaned with a soap solution and water to remove the organic impurities on the surface, followed by sonication for 10 minutes in Millipore water, acetone, and isopropanol. After drying these plates over a N2 flow, they were immersed in a 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4, washed with water and ethanol, and subsequently sintered at 500 °C for 30 minutes. A 11.4 ± 0.85 μm thick (Fig. S7, ESI†), 0.196 cm2 active area nanocrystalline transparent TiO2 layer was coated using the doctor blade technique, and these TiO2 coated electrodes were heated at 50 °C for 15 min, followed by sintering at 450 °C for half an hour. After cooling to room temperature, a scattering layer of TiO2 colloid was coated on the top of the transparent layer and dried for 20 minutes at 50 °C followed by sintering at 400 °C for 20 minutes (FTO/TiO2). Finally, FTO/TiO2 was immersed in 5 mL of 0.5 mM PC0, PC1 or PC2 dye bath containing different solvents such as tertiary butyl alcohol and acetonitrile (1:1 ratio; TACN), ACN, DCM, acetone (ACE), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), chloroform (CHCl3) and chlorobenzene (C6H5Cl) and kept at room temperature for 24 h. To understand the effect of dye aggregation on TiO2, 5 mM CDCA has been added to the dye solution. Finally, the stained electrodes (Photoanodes) were rinsed with the respective solvent to remove the unadsorbed dye. The iodine/iodide electrolyte [0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M, I2, and 0.5 M TBP, 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium iodide (0.6 M) in 1 mL of ACN (85%) and Valero nitrile (15%)] was used to soak the dye-coated FTO/TiO2 film and sandwiched against a platinum-coated FTO electrode. To prevent short circuit and electrolyte leak, the two electrodes were separated by a 60 μm hot-melt Surlyn gasket film.
2.7. Computational details
All the theoretical calculations on the dyes were performed with the help of Gaussian 09.40 To gain insights about the molecular structure, Kohn–Sham density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level was performed.41,42 TD-DFT calculations were carried out on the optimized ground state geometries to obtain oscillator strengths (f) and excitation energies using CAM-B3LYP43 and PBE1PBE44 functional and 6-31G(d,p) method. The effect of solvent (DCM) was included by an integral equation formalism polarizable continuum model (IEF-PCM) (dielectric constant, ε = 8.93).45
To understand the dye and TiO2 interactions, we had calculated the adsorption of dye molecules onto the semiconductor anatase TiO2 surface (1 0 1) by VASP46,47 (Vienna ab initio simulation package), using generalized gradient approximation (GGA) together with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.48,49 The pseudopotential was used based on the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method that explicitly includes the valence electrons. An energy cutoff of 520 eV was used. Moreover, the total densities of states (TDOS) of the dye@TiO2 complex systems and the projected density of states (PDOS) of the TiO2 supercell were also calculated at a similar level to analyze the adsorption properties.50–53
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Absorption spectra
UV-visible absorption experiments have been performed to investigate the light-harvesting potential and the molar extinction coefficient (ε) of the dyes (PC0, PC1, and PC2). A DCM stock solution of 0.5 × 10−3 M dye was prepared, and the absorbance was measured in a dilute concentration, and ε was calculated for the ICT bands. Fig. 2a shows the absorption spectrum of the dyes in the DCM solvent. The dyes displayed prominent absorption bands in the range of 200–500 nm. The bands in the higher energy region are attributed to the π–π* transition of the pyrene–carbazole fluorophores, whereas the lower energy band is because of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from donor to acceptor. The λmax values for PC0, PC1, and PC2 were 430 nm, 410 nm, and 387 nm, respectively. The calculated ε for the ICT of dyes were PC0:1.03 × 104 M−1 cm−1, PC1:3.59 × 104 M−1 cm−1, and PC2:4.19 × 104 M−1 cm−1, respectively, which are higher than that of Ru–complex sensitizers N3 (1.39 × 104 M−1 cm−1) and N719 (1.40 × 104 M−1 cm−1).54

TD-DFT calculations were carried out using PBE1PBE/6-31G(d,p) for PC0 and PC1 dyes, and the CAM-B3LYP functional was used for the PC2 dye, to understand the electronic transitions from the occupied to virtual orbitals. Fig. 2b displays the theoretical UV-Vis absorption spectra of dyes obtained by considering the 20 lowest singlet–singlet transitions in the DCM solvent. The simulated absorption spectra show reasonable agreement (in terms of the qualitative order of the maximum wavelength (λcom) of ICT peak; PC0 (449 nm) > PC1 (421 nm) > PC2 (386 nm)) with the experimental UV-Vis spectra of the dyes in DCM solvent. The calculated absorption spectrum of the dyes deviates from the experimental absorption spectrum within the 20 nm limit which is acceptable. The details of the calculated oscillator strength (f), λcom, triplet state energy and the percentage of the major transitions are presented in Table 1.

Generally, short conjugation leads to high triplet energy to the dye. Still, carbazole, although having three fused rings, is characterized with high triplet energy.55 In particular, carbazole whose 3 and 6 positions substituted possess a higher triplet energy than carbazole itself. The reason behind this is that the five-membered heterocyclic aromatic ring in carbazole has reduced aromaticity resulting in a reduced conjugation effect between the five-membered heterocyclic aromatic ring and the neighbouring benzene rings. We have calculated the triplet energy of the dyes, and it is 1.44, 1.73, and 1.38 eV for PC0, PC1, and PC2, respectively. PC1 is higher than PC0, as the presence of a single bond between the chromophores (pyrene and carbazole) reduces the conjugation of the molecule. As shown in Table 1, the % of HOMO–LUMO transition is low for PC2 in comparison to the PC1 and PC0; therefore, PC2 shows the lowest solution-phase λmax among the dyes studied here.
Furthermore, the λcom of ICT is in good agreement with the f and percentage of major transitions.
Solid state absorption studies (Fig. 3) were analyzed together with the solution state to understand the type of aggregation of the three dyes (PC0, PC1, and PC2) on the TiO2 film. H-type and J-type aggregations are because of the relative alignment of transition dipole moments on the adjacent molecules and predicting upfront the type of aggregation the molecule will adopt in a solid-state is a challenging task. To the best of our knowledge, there is no universal guideline developed on this topic.56 It has been reported in the literature that H-and J-type aggregation will lead to poor and better photovoltaic performance, respectively.57,58 In general, dye-aggregation might lead to quenching. At the same time, the formation of such aggregates has significant consequences for the energies of the excited states and the oscillator strengths of the transitions to these states from the ground state. In the literature, J-aggregation is credited with collective excitation of dye, which in turn improves the Jsc, thereby benefiting the DSSC.59 It can be seen that PC2 dyes on TiO2 film showed a broadened and red-shifted absorption compared to the solution state absorption spectrum and is due to J-aggregation (head-to-tail arrangement of dye molecules) which is beneficial for enhancing the PCE of DSSC.60 Whereas, when compared to the solution state, a blue shift is observed for PC0 dye on TiO2 film and is because of H-type aggregation. The aggregation of the H-type usually results in poor photovoltaic performance.61 On the TiO2 film, PC0 and PC2 dyes, along with CDCA, show a slight broadening in their absorption spectra compared to their CDCA free solid-state spectrum, whereas for PC1 + CDCA, a significant blue shift was observed. While we do not know the exact reason for this H-type aggregation of PC1 dye, we assume it is due to its comparatively rigid structure compared to PC2. The percentage decrease in the dye loading due to incorporation of CDCA is 31%, 44%, and 35% for dyes PC0, PC1, and PC2, respectively.

3.2. Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the dyes (PC0, PC1, and PC2) such as redox potential, energy level alignment with respect to TiO2 and I−/I3− redox couple were examined by cyclic voltammetry and computational methods. The benchmark analysis was done using different meta-hybrid functionals such as B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, M06, M06-2X, PBE1PBE, and WB97XD with the basis set 6-31G(d,p). A close match to the experimental data was seen with the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p), as shown in Table S1 (ESI†).
The representative CV of PC0 (Fig. 4) shows one oxidation and one reduction event, whereas PC1 and PC2 exhibit a pair of peaks for oxidation and a pair of peaks for reduction. The first oxidation peak (lower potential) may come from the aromatic core of the pyrene and the second one from the carbazole donor moiety. The HOMO–LUMO (EH–L, eV) gaps were calculated using eqn (1) from λonset (nm) of the absorption spectra. Following calibration with the Fc/Fc+ couple (Fc = Ferrocene), the energy level of HOMO (EHOMO) was determined using eqn (2), and from EH–L and EHOMO, the energy of LUMO (ELUMO) was calculated. The dyes exhibited a quasi-reversible redox behavior, and the calculated EHOMO were −5.30 eV, −5.07 eV, −5.05 eV vs. vacuum and the corresponding ELUMO values were −2.80 eV, −2.40 eV, −2.48 eV for the PC0, PC1 and PC2 dye, respectively. The experimental EH–L for PC0, PC1 and PC2 were 2.50 eV, 2.67 eV and 2.57 eV, respectively. EHOMO values indicate that the incorporation of carbazole makes PC1 and PC2 more electropositive than PC0, which is a requested property for easy oxidation of the dye while shining light. But, the increase in EH–L, upon the introduction of carbazole, indicates the poor light-harvesting ability of PC1 and PC2 at higher wavelengths compared to PC0, which is in line with the observation of solution UV-Vis spectra, wherein higher λmax was observed for PC0. At the same time, it should be noted that the ε values of PC1 and PC2 are higher than PC0; therefore, the introduction of carbazole may not be a bad choice as it enhances the probability of light absorption. PC1 having a higher ΔEH–L may indicate orthogonal positioning of pyrene with respect to carbazole donor moieties via a single bond spacer.
 Fig. 4  Cyclic voltammograms of the dyes in 0.1 M TBAPF6 in dry DCM solvent recorded at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. 
The experimental energy level diagram in Fig. 5, shows that both EHOMO and ELUMO are favorably aligned with the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor metal oxide (TiO2; −4.0 eV) and the redox energy level of the iodine/triiodide electrolyte (−4.8 eV), respectively, to complete the electrical circuit. The dye regeneration energy is found to be 0.5 eV, 0.27 eV and 0.25 eV for PC0, PC1 and PC2, respectively. According to the literature, the optimum driving force for dye regeneration lies in the range of 0.2–0.25 V to achieve a theoretical regeneration yield of 99.9%. As the driving force is further increased, the regeneration reaction becomes diffusion controlled,62 leading to a reduction in the photocurrent. Therefore, PC1 and PC2 are expected to perform better than PC0. The driving force for the electron injection (ΔGinj), that is, the energy difference of LUMO of the dye and CB of the semiconducting oxide, is found to be 1.20 eV, 1.60 eV, and 1.52 eV, for PC0, PC1, and PC2, respectively. (1) EHOMO(eV) = −[Eox1/2 − E1/2 (Fc/Fc+) + 5.1] vs. vacuum(2) ELUMO(eV) = EHOMO + E0–0(3)

3.3. Frontier molecular orbital diagram
The optimized geometries and electron distribution of dyes have been shown in the frontier molecular orbital diagram (FMO, Fig. 6a–c), which depicts the push–pull nature of ICT for the dyes. For the PC0 dye, HOMO is delocalized on the entire pyrene cyano-acrylic acid. In contrast, LUMO is shifted to the cyano-acrylic acid unit, with a small retention of electron density on the pyrene donor which is due to the electron-accepting nature of the pyrene. In the case of PC1 and PC2, HOMO covers both pyrene and carbazole donors along with the π-spacer, and LUMO shifted to the carbazole cyano-acrylic acid unit, as both the dyes have the same donors and acceptors. It is evident from the above results that the spatial separation of ICT is high for the PC1 and PC2 dye compared to PC0, which increases the efficiency of electron injection due to the maximum charge density on the cyano-acrylic acid acceptor. Furthermore, it is confirmed by a larger dipole moment observed for PC2 (9.92 D) than PC0 (9.75 D) and PC1 (7.92 D) dyes. The higher value for the dipole moment shows that the distance between the centroid of the hole and the electron is longer and thus shows a strong separation of the charge. PDOS was calculated using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) method, and the relevant data is shown in Table S2 (ESI†). For the dyes PC0, PC1, and PC2, the electron density is delocalized to a larger extent in the donor part for HOMO and in the acceptor part for LUMO.

3.4. Dihedral angle
The geometry (twist vs. planar) of dyes is one of the most critical factors determining the efficiency of ICT, which, in turn, results in the light-harvesting ability and photovoltaic properties of DSSCs. Fig. 7 and 8 show the geometry-optimized ground-state molecular structures of dyes with the dihedral angles measured at the interface of pyrene/carbazole (via single and double bonds) and carbazole/cyano-acrylic acid. The role of carbazole is apparent while comparing the dihedral angles measured between the donor and acceptor. For PC0, the dihedral angle between the unit of pyrene and cyano-acrylic acid is 138.26° (trans configuration). In contrast, for PC1 and PC2 (between carbazole and cyano-acrylic acid, trans configuration), the angles are 179.84° and 179.58°, respectively, suggesting that the introduction of carbazole enables achieving planarity between the donor and acceptor, which could be the reason for the high ε values of PC1 and PC2. For PC1, the dihedral angle between pyrene and carbazole is 123.23°, and for PC2, the dihedral angle between pyrene and the double bond is 153.48°, and double bond and carbazole is 169.11°. Therefore, ICT from the pyrene end to the acceptor is expected to be effective in PC2 than PC1 due to the near planarity in the overall dye structure.

3.5. Reorganization energy calculation
Reorganization energy is the energy penalty caused by the conformational change in the molecule during photooxidation and regeneration. According to Marcus electron transfer theory, it could affect the kinetics of electron injection. Customarily, reorganization energy can have two parts: internal reorganization energy (Λint) and external reorganization energy (Λext). Λext embodies the effect of charge transfer due to solvent medium, and Λint due to the structural transformation between neutral and ionic states. We ignored the effect of the solvent and considered the Λint of the isolated organic molecule DFT calculation to speculate the mobility of the charge carriers. The sum of the electron (Λe) and hole (Λh) reorganization energies is the total reorganization energy (Λtotal). The smaller the Λtotal, the better the electron injection ability to achieve a higher JSC. The calculated Λe, Λh, and Λtotal of the three dyes are given in Table 2. The Λtotal value of PC1 and PC2 is nearly equal and smaller than that of PC0. This indicates that PC0 will have a lower electron injection ability, therefore is expected to show low PCE in DSSC. PC1 and PC2 exhibited the lowest Λtotal, which would enhance the rate of electron transfer to the CB of TiO2 from the excited state of the dye, which is expected to manifest in their PCE as well.

3.6. Adsorption and density of states of the dye@TiO2(101) surface
The adsorption energies (Eads) of PC1 and PC2 are calculated on the anatase TiO2(1 0 1) surface using DFT calculations after attaching the dye molecule. The optimization of geometries was done on dye anchored TiO2 using the bidentate bridging mode, which is shown in Fig. 9. The calculated distance between Ti and O (from the acceptor), and adsorption energy of the dyes have been tabulated in Table 3. The negative adsorption energy (Eads) implies the formation of a chemical bond between the dye and TiO2 surface, hence there will be better electron injection ability from the LUMO of the dye to the CB of the TiO2. The Eads values are estimated by using eqn (4), and the values are listed in Table 3. Eads = E(dye+TiO2) − (Edye + ETiO2)(4)where E(dye+TiO2) is the total energy for the dye anchored onto the TiO2 surface, and ETiO2 and Edye refer to the total energies of the TiO2 semiconductor and isolated dye, respectively. Both PC1 and PC2 showed a sufficiently negative adsorption energy value. Furthermore, DOS calculations were performed to understand the nature of bonding interaction of the dye molecules with the TiO2 surface. The PDOS profiles of the TiO2 slab, the DOS of dye, and dye@TiO2 (in the case of dye absorbed onto the TiO2 surface) are displayed in Fig. 10. It is clear from the DOS of TiO2(101) oriented slab, that the surface does not lead to any defect states in the bandgap. PDOS of the dye adsorbed TiO2 surface confirms the absence of any defect state/trap states in the bandgap of TiO2, which helps in the smooth transfer of electrons from the dye to TiO2.

3.7. Photovoltaic performance

Fig. 11 illustrates the J–V diagram of the dyes (PC0, PC1, and PC2), and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters such as VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE are summarized in Table 4. The photovoltaic performance of the fabricated DSSCs in different solvents (TACN, ACN, ACE, DCM, CHCl3, EtOAc, and C6H5Cl) was assessed under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) (Fig. S8 and Tables S3–S5, ESI†). The standard N719 dye was also measured under the same experimental conditions. It can be inferred that the sensitizing solvent greatly affects the PCE of DSSC, and the best PCE is observed with a 1:1 mixture of TACN for the dyes (PC0, PC1, and PC2). The FF and the PCE of the DSSC were calculated by the following eqn (5) and (6) (5) (6)Pin is the incident light power, Jmax (mA cm−2) and Vmax (V) are the current density and voltage at the maximum power point in the J–V curves, respectively.

The VOC was in the range of 0.71–0.81 V for the dyes in the chosen solvents, whereas the JSC and FF have varied for the dyes in different solvents. The solvent effect on DSSC performance is complicated. It may be attributed to the various properties such as solubility, dielectric constant, polarity, viscosity, etc. and this decides the optimum amount of the dye adsorbed on the TiO2 electrode.63,64 It is thus found that TACN is the best solvent for the dyes. As expected, the open circuit potential for PC1 and PC2 is slightly higher compared to PC0, which is consistent with the oxidation ability of the two donors in the dyes. The photovoltaic parameters (VOC, JSC, PCE) are found to be in the following order: PC2 > PC1 > PC0. The DSSC of PC2 showed the best PCE at 5.57%. As anticipated, CDCA (coadsorbent) lowered the dye loading, mitigated the aggregation of dyes, and improved the performance of PC0 and PC2 dyes, except for PC1. As noted in the solid-state UV-Vis spectra, the incorporation of CDCA leads to H-aggregation/blue shift; therefore, the lower performance of PC1 in the presence of CDCA is justifiable. Generally, strong π–π packing leads to H-aggregation (characterized by a blue shift in the absorption spectrum). The head-to-tail arrangement of dye molecules results in J-aggregation, which is characterized by the red-shift in the absorption spectra. Furthermore, the addition of CDCA improved the PCE of PC2 to 6.30%. The dye loading of PC0 is higher than that of PC1 and PC2, probably due to the strong π–π interaction of the pyrene moiety. Whereas in the case of PC1 and PC2, N-octyl substitution of the carbazole moiety led to reduced dye interaction and hence dye loading. The higher dye-loading of PC0 has a double-edged sword effect. On the one side, it is favorable for improved light-harvesting, but this beneficial effect may be offset by an increased energy loss in dye aggregates that would reflect in the photovoltaic properties.65 Despite having the maximum λmax (430 nm) and a higher dye loading (8.7 × 10−7 Mol−1 cm−1) among the dyes studied, the low VOC, JSC, and PCE found for the PC0 dye can be attributed to low ε and the H-type aggregation of the dye molecules on the TiO2 surface whereas the decreased efficiency of the PC1 dye in the presence of CDCA can be due to their weak adsorption on the TiO2 surface as well as to the H-type aggregation of dye molecules through CDCA on to the TiO2 surface.
3.8. Dye loading calculations
The amount of the dye adsorbed on the TiO2 films was calculated using the Beer–Lamberts law, by extracting the dye into 0.1 M NaOH solution in a mixed solvent of (THF/H2O, 1:1 V/V). Dye loading values (shown in Table 4) were calculated using the following formula: C = AV/εS0 where C is the amount of dye loaded on the TiO2 film (mol cm−2), A is the absorbance of the dye, V is the volume of desorption solution (ml), and S0 is the active area of the TiO2 films (cm2).
3.9. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
The charge transfer resistances across the photoanode/electrolyte/counter electrode interfaces of DSSC can be obtained by EIS analysis. The obtained Nyquist plot was best fitted with the equivalent circuit Rs(R1Q1)(R2Q2) by ZSimpWin 3.6 software (Fig. 12a and b). Table 5 summarizes the values for the different electrical elements extracted by fitting the experimental data to the assumed equivalent circuit. It can be observed that the electrolyte resistance (Rs) has increased slightly with the addition of CDCA, indicating a change in the photoanode/electrolyte interface, as confirmed by the dye loading studies. Fig. 12a and b displays two semicircles for all DSSCs. The small semicircle in the high-frequency range is ascribed to the charge transfer at the Pt counter electrode/electrolyte interface (R1; FTO/Pt). The R1 is nearly the same for all the dyes reported in this study, as they possess the same counter electrode (Pt). The larger semicircle in the lower frequency region corresponds to charge recombination resistance (R2) at the TiO2/dye-electrolyte interface. The characteristic frequency (fmax) of the second semicircle in the presence of CDCA is indicated in the Bode plot as 25.1, 7.4, and 6.31 Hz for DSSCs based on PC0, PC1, and PC2, respectively. This indicates that the electron lifetime in the CB of TiO2 is higher for PC1 and PC2 and are associated with their higher VOC values.66

At VOC, since the charge carriers are not extracted from the photoanode to counter electrode, a buildup of a large amount of electron occurs, whose concentration depends on the equilibrium between the generation of charge carriers by light absorption and annihilation by recombination. Since the light absorption and electron injections happen at the fs scale, they would not be mapped in the frequency range chosen for EIS. Therefore, the charge transfer resistance, R2, is a composite of the dye regeneration by I− and back electron transfer from the CB of TiO2 to the I3− in the electrolyte. The extent of the later must be to the same extent in all the three DSSCs studied as identical semiconductors and an electrolyte interface is used in all the three dyes. Therefore, any modulation occurring in R2 may be assumed mainly due to the dye+/I− interface (i.e., dye regeneration kinetics). The solid-state UV-Vis spectrum of PC0 (Fig. 3a) exhibits a red-shift upon incorporating CDCA. Pyrene is well known for its aggregation-induced emission (AIE) due to its face-to-face aggregation leading to an excimer (excited dimer) during the excitation. Generally, π–π stacking quenches the fluorescence, but it is the opposite for pyrene due to the excimer formation.67 The π–π interaction impedes dye reorganization and dye regeneration kinetics at the oxidized dye(dye+)/I− interface. Therefore, for PC0, both the VOC and JSC are expected to be low. Upon including CDCA, a small decrease in dye loading occurs, causing ∼30 mV increase in the VOC. The increase in VOC signifies more concentration of electrons in the CB of TiO2 and a corresponding increase in the dye+ concentration. The redshift of absorption in the PC0 + CDCA based photoanode also reflects in its R2 value, which is nearly 18 Ω lower than its PC0 based counterpart. The decrease in R2 with the incorporation of CDCA is possibly related to the increased dye regeneration rate as a result of increased dye+ concentration. The absorption spectra of the PC1 + CDCA based photoanode is blue-shifted compared to the PC1-based photoanode; therefore, the R2 value has increased with the incorporation of CDCA. The UV-Vis spectrum of PC2 + CDCA was nearly the same as the PC2 counterpart with reduced dye loading. Nearly 50% decrease in dye loading improved the FF and PCE to 0.68 and 6.3%, respectively. Since the experiment was carried out under illumination, the electrode that exhibits high PCE would have low R2. It can be seen that the diameter of the low-frequency semicircle has decreased with the addition of CDCA, except for PC1, which is in line with the J–V performance. The capacitance associated with R2 (without including diffusion) can be expressed as a constant phase element (CPE), whose impedance is defined as . The parameters N and Q are frequency independent. If N = 1, Q has the units of capacitance (F or mho s−1), and it indicates the capacitance of the interface, and for N ≠ 1, Q generates a unit of mho × SN. Q1 and Q2 are the CPE of the Pt/electrolyte interface and photoanode/electrolyte interface, respectively.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we have designed and synthesized two new sensitizers with an architecture of D-π-D′–A containing pyrene and carbazole as donor moieties and cyano-acrylic acid as the acceptor bridged by a single bond and double bond spacer. PC0 dye was taken as a reference to understand the effect of structural modification on the photovoltaic performance. The photophysical, computational, and J–V characterizations of the dyes have been done to understand their potential for DSSC applications. Among the three dyes, PC2 showed the best PCE of 5.57%, which is compared to that of the N719 dye (PCE = 7.53%) under the same experimental conditions, which is further improved to 6.30% upon the addition of CDCA. The PCE of the fabricated DSSCs is determined by numerous factors such as the UV visible spectra of the dyes, energy levels, electron injection ability, charge recombination, dipole moment, dye regeneration, dye orientation on the TiO2 film, dye loading and dye aggregation. The results reveal that the nature of the relationship between the afore-mentioned properties and structure of dyes is inherently multifaceted.
The dyes displayed the absorption spectrum in the visible region with high ε and it is comparable with the standard ruthenium dyes. It is interesting to note the dihedral angle between two donors, donor and acceptor as they control the ICT of the molecule to the CB of TiO2. The dihedral angle measurement clearly shows that the PC2 and PC1 dyes have better electronic contact with the TiO2 film than the PC0 dye due to the planarity of the cyano-acrylic acid acceptor with the carbazole donor. CV studies showed that the two donors significantly improved the oxidation ability of the PC1 and PC2 dyes and it is reflected in their VOC values too. The reorganization energy of PC1 and PC2 dyes were almost same and they were lower than the reference dye. The results demonstrate that a higher ε, low oxidation potential, J-aggregation on the TiO2 film and efficient charge transfer from the donor to acceptor significantly contributed to the superior PCE of the PC2 dye.
