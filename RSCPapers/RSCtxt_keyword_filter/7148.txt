    , Accepted 16th September 2020First published on 22nd September 2020AbstractNickel oxide (NiOx) as a hole transport layer has been vastly investigated in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to the nature of p-type doping, highly transparent materials, and deep-lying valence bands. In this paper, a new phase based on trivalent Ni2O3 is synthesized by low temperature solution processing of mixed nickel (acetate/nitrate). In comparison, high-temperature solution-processing of divalent NiOx resulted in novel Ni2O3 thin films that display better consistency and superior energy compatibility with perovskite thin films. In this respect, high-performance perovskite solar cells are efficiently produced utilizing MA0.85FA0.15PbI0.9Cl0.1 perovskite with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) reaching 17.89% and negligible hysteresis comparable to 14.37% for NiOx. The Ni2O3-based PSCs reported the highest fill factor (FF) (82.66%) compared to that of divalent NiOx (67.53%). Different characterization studies and analyses supply proof of improved film quality, increased transport and extraction of charges, and suppressed charge recombination. Meanwhile, the device exhibits low hysteresis compared to sol–gel-processed NiOx.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cell (PSC) research has made dramatic advances in the past decade. Although PSCs’ power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached a high level of around 25%, many problems, such as low stability and high cost, remain obstacles to commercial application.1–4 Different materials are available in terms of electron selection side to minimize degradation and avoid the recombination of charge carriers. Even so, the inventory in terms of hole transport materials (HTMs) is strictly minimal. Advanced PSCs include primarily organic HTMs, such as poly-bis (4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) amine (PTAA), 2,2,7,7-tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine), 9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) and polystyrene (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) sulfate (PEDOT:PSS).5–7 These organic HTMs have many drawbacks: low crystallinity, low mobility, high costs and potential humidity or air degradation.8,9 In particular, there are very few alternatives concerning inorganic counterparts that exhibit thermal/chemical compatibilities at low treatment temperatures and high stability.10,11
NiOx has a more significant bandgap, higher permeability and better chemical stability among the different inorganic materials mentioned. In addition, NiOx is best suited for the perovskite layer in the case of energy levels, which is not hindered by hole accumulation and electron blocking.12,13 In addition, NiOx can be synthesized by a variety of processes, including some flexible or scalable manufacturing processes (sputtering, vaporization, burning, pulsed laser deposition, and atomic layer deposition).14–17 Fig. S1† shows the price breakdown pie charts for PSCs with organic HTM as opposed to NiOx. Due to the low intrinsic electrical conductivity of pristine NiOx, further development of the NiOx-based components is minimal. To address this issue, numerous approaches such as metal ion doping and surface processing have been developed to improve the quality of NiOx.18–20 Among them, doping with metal ions has proven to be a powerful strategy for adjusting the electrical properties of the semiconductor NiOx films. For example, to improve the conductivity of the NiOx film, various types of metal dopants have been used, such as Cu, Co, Cs, Zn and Li.20–23 Other methods such as oxygen plasma,24 extrinsic doping21,25,26 and double layers of carbon/NiOx27–29 were reported to increase the work function and to adjust bandgap alignment.
To date, most thin NiOx films have been processed with a high-temperature annealing process that is not suitable for low-temperature flexible applications. Although NiOx nanoparticles were applied in a solution using low-temperature annealing techniques to make the device, the oxygen and conductivity ratio is unstable due to the large surface area to volume ratio of the nanoparticles.30,31 Fortunately, the auto-energetic and exothermic reaction offers lower transitional energy for the creation of metal oxide networks, reducing the high thermal energy available in the conversion process.30,31However, the sol–gel-based endothermic process gains external heat energy by tempering at high temperatures of up to 400 °C.32 For example, Marks et al. effectively doped high-performance transistors based on zinc oxide and indium oxide through combustion processes at low temperatures.30 Jen and colleagues have also shown that the Cu:NiOx interlayer and system based on combustion obtained a respectable PCE, suggesting their ability for PSC at high temperatures.21
In this study, we first investigated the combustion-exothermic reaction of Ni–Ni self-doping instead of another metal doping. The innovated low-temperature annealing method obtained trivalent nickel oxide (Ni2O3) thin film through mixing nickel (acetate/nitrate) as a precursor. The addition of nitrate precursor leads to an exothermic reaction and accelerates the formation of metal oxide by eliminating the requirement of high thermal energy. Ni2O3 thin film obtained by this low-temperature method shows good compatible transparency, conductivity, and charge extraction ability. When it is utilized as a hole transport layer (HTL) in planar PSC, the device reaches a PCE of 17.89% with less hysteresis and shows good reproducibility compared to NiOx HTL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time perovskite solar cells based on Ni2O3–HTL have been fabricated.
2. Results and discussion
In most previous work, nickel acetate has been used as a source for NiOx as HTL through the sol–gel method at deposition temperatures ranging from 350 to 450 °C.33–35 There is no doubt that the high temperature is undesirable for fabricating HTL in perovskite solar cells. In this work, we have developed a new technique to decrease the temperature and increase the conductivity of nickel oxide by fabricating trivalent nickel ion (Ni3+) (Ni2O3–HTM). Using this method, metal oxide films at much lower thermal annealing temperature display better film uniformity and crystallinity than those generated with conventional sol–gel processes. The Ni2O3 phase is achieved by a mixture solution of nickel acetate tetrahydrate (Ni–Ac) and nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni–Nt) dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol solvent. The flowchart for the synthetic procedures of Ni2O3 as a hole transport material is presented in Fig. 1(a). To understand and elucidate the lower temperature of the fabricated thin film based on Ni–Ac and Ni–Nt mixtures, we performed thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) as shown in Fig. 1(a–c). It can be seen that the decomposition steps for both nickel acetate tetrahydrate (Ni–Ac) and nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni–Nt) can be divided into a few steps, while the mixed one (Ni-Mix) has only one-step decomposition. Therefore, the TGA measurements reflect nickel acetate is enhanced upon adding nickel nitrate, which accelerates the burning of the composite and thus decreases the whole temperature. The corresponding degradation molecules are described in detail in Table 1. Based on DTA studies, Fig. 1(c) shows a strong exothermic wide band effect for Ni-Mix at ∼345 °C. This indicates that the role of nickel nitrate was significant in the conversion of metal oxide as the heating source or energy needed to complete the reaction.

Furthermore, a non-isothermal method was used to calculate the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters. In this work, the non-isothermal kinetic analyses for the thermal decompositions of Ni–Ac, Ni–Nt, and Ni-Mix were performed using the Coats–Redfern process. The details of the kinetic studies can be found in ESI. From Table S1,† the following remarks can be pointed out for the Ni-Mix: (i) the Cs values for the thermal decomposition of the complexes are (n) similar to one, suggesting that the decomposition meets the first order kinetics; (ii) enthalpy ΔH* with negative values means that the process of decomposition is endothermic; (iii) positive entropy activation ΔS* values suggest faster reactions and more stable materials and (iv) the ΔG* changes are substantially representative of non-spontaneous reactions. Since the TGA characterization confirms the exothermic reaction, the formation of thin Ni2O3 films requires a much lower temperature.
The resulting film from Ni-Mix with a new phase of Ni2O3 was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. Fig. 2(a) shows the XRD patterns of the Ni2O3 film that was synthesized according to Fig. 1(a). It is observed that the obtained patterns matched with those of hexagonal Ni2O3 in accordance with JCPDS card no. 14-0481 with the lattice parameters of a = 4.61 Å, b = 4.61 Å, and c = 5.61 Å. This hexagonal structure can be confirmed by the (101), (002), and (102) peaks located at 27.5°, 31.9°, and 39.1°.36 The atomic configurations of the hexagonal Ni2O3 in the primitive unit cell symmetry is described in Fig. 2(c). In the primitive unit cell, the sixteen cations and twenty-four anions are assigned to the Wyckoff positions 4 and 6, respectively, and the atoms are numbered to reflect the variations in the Wyckoff positions. NiOx thin films were synthesized from Ni–Ac through the sol–gel method. The obtained patterns match with cubic-structured NiOx in accordance with the standard patterns of JCPDS card no. 47-1049 with the lattice parameters of a = 4.177 Å and S.G = Fmm.37,38 The (111), (200), and (220) peaks located at 37.3°, 43.3°, and 62.9°, respectively, support the cubic structure.

The transmittance spectra were checked to determine the transmittances and the optical bandgaps of the NiOx and Ni2O3 thin-films. The procedure was conducted with NiOx or Ni2O3 films of thickness ≈20–30 nm. As shown in Fig. 3(a), in the wavelength range from 275 to 800 nm, the Ni2O3 thin film displays a higher optical transmittance than NiOx, though NiOx transmittance occurred in the wavelength range of 300 to 800 nm. It shows that the Ni2O3 thin films have strong optical transmittance and improved light absorption in the perovskite layer. The higher transmittance was correlated with a stronger crystallinity that helps transport charges and extract charges. Using Tuac's equations: αhν = A(hy − Eg)n,39,40 the optical band for NiOx and Ni2O3 thin films were calculated through the transmittance spectra. The plots of (αhν)2 and (αhν)1/2vs. hν were produced, from which a direct bandgap was found (Fig. 3(b)) by extrapolating the linear portion of the curve to (αhν)2 = 0.41 The curves indicate that the values of the direct bandgap Eg are equal to 3.62 and 3.86 eV for the NiOx and Ni2O3 samples, respectively. Compared to NiOx, the Ni2O3 thin film exhibits a slightly larger bandgap.

(h) and (i) XPS spectra with curve fitting of Ni2+ and O 1s for NiOx. 
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used here to examine NiOx and Ni2O3 thin films for work function characterization. As shown in Fig. 3(c–e), Ni2O3's Fermi energy level is significantly downshifted relative to that of NiOx. For pristine NiOx (Fig. S3†),12,42 the work function (second cutoff) is about 4.43 eV, while that of Ni2O343 marginally increased to 5.02 eV. The improved Ni2O3 energy level could allow more favorable alignment of the band between Ni2O3 and perovskites (MA0.85FA0.15PbI0.9Cl0.1). Therefore, Ni2O3 has a marginally higher valence band maximum (VBM) of 5.61 eV compared to NiOx which has a VBM of 5.21 eV. The energy levels of Ni2O3 match better with perovskite's valence band (5.9 eV) for hole conveying and electron blocking. In addition, the increased work function could improve the potential difference between HTL VB and perovskite conduction band (CB), leading to an increase in the VOC of the device.44 The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of NiOx and Ni2O3 thin films were analyzed to check the element composition, as shown in Fig. 3(f–i). The XPS data obtained clearly show the presence of the Ni2O3 phase (Fig. 3(f and g)). The O 1s peak at 531.2 eV is assigned to Ni2O3.45 The XPS spectra of NiOx show a peak at 852.3 eV for the Ni2+ state and the corresponding O 1s is assigned to the oxygen of NiOx.46 The shift of the peaks shown in Fig. 3(g) toward lower binding energy in Ni2O3 films can be attributed to the photoelectrons emitted from the lower oxidation states of Ni3+ (sub-stoichiometric). Moreover, this shift could also be caused by the adsorbed ions of OH groups, or other bonded oxygen-related species.47
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been used to analyze NiOx and Ni2O3 surface morphologies. The thin films of Ni2O3 show similar smooth and much more robust surface morphology (root mean square (RMS): 19.6 nm) on substrates of fluorine tin oxide (FTO) compared to thin films of NiOx (RMS: 20.1 nm) as shown in Fig. 4(a and b). In addition, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) contact angle measurements (CAM) have been obtained for Ni2O3 and NiOx film surface wettability, as shown in Fig. 4(c and d). It is noted that the Ni2O3 thin film has more excellent wettability than the NiOx thin film. The low contact angle or hydrophilic nature of Ni2O3 is related to the less number of functional groups connected to the surface. The higher contact angle for NiOx can be ascribed to the presence of the hydroxyl group which results from the CH3COO− anion. However, this functional group is decreased on the surface of Ni2O3 as the Ni precursor contains mixed anions (CH3COO− and NO3−). Therefore, the DMF solvent's lower contact angle is beneficial for the distribution of perovskite solution and the development of high-quality perovskite thin films. To further study using CAM, the surface free energy (SFE) can be provided by the Wu model48 by separating the surface energy into nonpolar (dispersion) and polar components (eqn (1)) using diiodomethane (CH2I2) and distilled water (H2O), respectively. There is no doubt that the substrate can improve the formation of a perovskite layer through surficial status. Here, we followed the Wu model to test the surface properties of Ni2O3 as opposed to the NiOx-coated substrates by calculating the contact angle. The angle touch for both CH2I2 and H2O was expressed, respectively, by CH2I2 and H2O. The SFE total is determined from the dispersion sum for dispersive and polar liquids as shown in the eqn (1). γtotal = γd + γp(1)

The measured data are given in Table 2, showing the surface energies of NiOx and Ni2O3 substrates as 74.82 and 82.90 mN m−1, respectively. Accordingly, relative to NiOx as a control sample, we found enhanced values for the Ni2O3 substrate of γtotal. The Ni2O3 phase decreased the values of θCH2I2 and θH2O and thus increased the values of γd and γp. The corresponding changes in the substrate surface energies (hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties) will probably influence the perovskite structure, and thus the optoelectronic properties of the Ni2O3–perovskite interface.

It was reported that the output of the perovskite device was related to film morphology, film crystallinity, crystal size, etc. In this work, we have introduced a one-step deposition method to improve perovskite film formation. The composition of the perovskite structure was optimized by this ratio (MA 0.85FA0.15PbI0.9Cl0.1) and by a DMF:DMSO ratio of 0.88:0.12 percentage. The limited quantity ratio of DMSO was added to the solution to slow down the perovskite crystallization rate and create a thick perovskite film with a pure phase and better crystal grains. In addition, formamidinium iodide (FAI) was formulated to boost perovskite absorption, which is useful for higher densities of short-circuit current (JSC). It has been known that the HTM thin-film layers affect perovskite film formation. Here, we have studied the perovskite film structure on both NiOx and Ni2O3 surfaces. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to measure film morphology and crystallinity. The perovskite film grown on Ni2O3 film, as shown in Fig. 4(e and f), shows a fully covered surface morphology with compact and large crystallized grains similar to but strengthened with respect to the NiOx grains. The perovskite film on Ni2O3 has a larger average grain size (550–700 nm) than that on NiOx (450–600 nm). It can be due to the different surface states and surface energies.
A steady-state PL quenching experiment was performed to test the charge extraction efficiencies of the perovskite films on different HTL layers. As shown in Fig. 5, using MA0.85FA0.15PbI0.9Cl0.1 as an absorber, we compared the hole extraction efficiencies of NiOx with Ni2O3–HTL as a reference. As clarified in Fig. 5(a), the perovskite on Ni2O3 film displays more efficient PL quenching than the one on NiOx, elucidating that Ni2O3 can extract the holes more efficiently. In addition, the time-resolved PL (TRPL) reveals similar results with steady state PL quenching (Fig. 5(b)). The carrier lifetime was determined by a double exponential decay model fitting the TRPL curves. The lifetime of perovskite without HTL was determined to be around 1210 ns. When the perovskite was deposited on the NiOx or Ni2O3–HTL, its lifetime was shortened to 465 and 459 ns, respectively. To evidence the film conductivity, the electrical resistance measurements were carried out under an ambient atmosphere at room temperature using the four-point probe method.49 The resistivities of NiOx and Ni2O3 are calculated to be 23.24 and 15.32 Ω, respectively. It is known that resistivity can be diminished by adding Ni3+ ions in NiOx crystallites to reduce either Ni vacancies and/or interstitial oxygen. The exact conduction mechanism of nickel oxide may be due to the thermal excitation of holes at shallow acceptors or due to the thermal excitation of polarons.50 In addition, the hole mobilities of NiOx and Ni2O3 thin films are measured by the Hall effect method11,51,52 and recorded as 11.2 and 25.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. All of these findings indicate that there was efficient hole transfer between the layers of perovskite and NiOx and Ni2O3, which is important for efficient hole extraction in perovskite devices.

To explore the effect of our HTL layer on the performance of perovskite devices, the FTO/NiOx or Ni2O3/MA 0.85FA0.15PbI0.9Cl0.1/PCBM/BCP/Ag structural configuration of the solar cell devices was fabricated as shown in Fig. 5(c). The detailed manufacturing procedures for the devices are listed in the Experimental section. The procedure was conducted with a thin NiOx or Ni2O3 (≈25 nm) layer as the first layer on an FTO glass substrate. Next, an MA 0.85FA0.15PbI0.9Cl0.1 film with a uniform and dense thickness of ∼450 nm was coated on the NiOx or Ni2O3 substrate. Then, the PCBM/BCP layer was coated to a thickness of ∼20 nm. Finally, the device fabrication was back contacted by the Ag electrode (PVD). The energy level diagram shown in Fig. 5(d), which is schematically drawn based on the values mentioned before, clarifies that the electrons and holes carriers could be efficiently transferred and extracted. Fig. S4(a–c)† depicts the optimum device's cross-section SEM images based on Ni2O3, NiOx, and PEDOT:PSS HTLs, respectively. High-quality perovskite films of approximately 450 nm have been observed in Ni2O3-based devices which are supposed to be helpful for efficient charge generation and transportation, while the other two devices based on NiOx and PEDOT:PSS showed lower quality perovskite films with lower crystallinity. Meanwhile, NiOx or Ni2O3 thickness has been designed around 20 nm for high-performance devices.

Fig. 5(e) shows the comparison of the J–V curves of the NiOx, Ni2O3, and PEDOT:PSS-based devices. Table 3 outlines the device parameters and statistics. The Ni2O3-based PSC device presents a favorable PCE of 17.89% with a JSC of 19.67 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.1 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.83, whereas the NiOx HTL-based device has a PCE of 14.37% (VOC, JSC, and FF are 1.11 V, 19.17 mA cm−2, and 0.68, respectively). The JSC value and FF of Ni2O3-based devices are improved due to enhancing film crystallinity, efficient charge transfer and expanded light absorption, which is compatible with film characterization, as discussed above. The device JSC was also checked by external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 5(f)). It can be seen that the integrated JSC calculated from the EQE spectra are 19.81 and 19.55 mA cm−2 for the devices based on Ni2O3 and NiOx, respectively, which match well with those obtained from J–V measurements. The slightly higher EQE value of the device based on Ni2O3 HTL is believed to be related to the improved film light absorption and enhanced charge collection. This also proposed less recombination in the optimized Ni2O3 thin film compared to NiOx, or PEDOT:PSS. As discussed above, all the increases in JSC and FF indicate the beneficial function of Ni2O3 HTL such as increased film conductivity, improved energy band alignment, and diminished trap states. To support the role of Ni3+ in Ni2O3 HTL, Boyd et al.53 stated that Ni3+ metal cation sites in the NiOx thin film act as Brønsted proton acceptors and Lewis electron acceptors, deprotonating cationic amines and oxidizing iodide molecules, forming perovskite-rich hole extraction barriers at the perovskite–NiOx interface. This PSC efficiency is much better than that of most PEDOT:PSS-HTL-based devices that only deliver lower average PCE of 14.66% (VOC, JSC, and FF were 1.13 V, 17.83 mA cm−2, and 0.72, respectively).

The evaluated NiOx and Ni2O3 (HTL) device statistics show the reproducibility of the devices (Fig. 6), and the device parameters based on Ni2O3 display narrowly distributed PCE and other parameters, indicating excellent condition reliability. The series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) were determined to further comprehend the efficiency amplification. Opposed to the NiOx layer (Rs: 10.12 Ω cm−2, Rsh: 5.16 kΩ cm−2), the Ni2O3-based devices show decreased Rs (8.45 Ω cm−2) and increased Rsh (6.71 kΩ cm−2), which means that the Ni2O3-based devices have more effective charge transfer and less charge recombination. This is in line with the solar cell performance measured.

In the planar configured PSC device such as some NiOx-based devices, the hysteresis behavior was observed due to poor contact between NiOx and perovskite. The hysteresis can cause a misleading estimation of efficiency. The cause of the hysteresis activity is very complicated as it could be influenced by several variables like interface/crystal deficiencies, ion migration, perovskite grain boundary, ferroelectricity, and so on.54,55 To explain the advantages of Ni2O3–HTL, the hystereses of the designed NiOx and Ni2O3–HTL devices were contrasted through scanning the device in various directions (reverse scan: from 1.2 to −0.2 V; forward scan: from −0.2 to 1.2 V). Fig. S5† shows that the Ni2O3-based device has a negligible hysteresis behavior as opposed to the NiOx-based device (Fig. S6†), further suggesting that the Ni2O3 thin film has an effective hole extraction capability. In addition, the higher FF (82.66%) of Ni2O3-based device is achieved by avoiding the charge transport losses and improving the band alignment between Ni2O3 and perovskite layer. This is also aligned with the aforementioned better Ni2O3–HTL properties.
3. Conclusion
In conclusion, using the one-step method to produce MAFAPbICl-based PSC, we revealed a trivalent Ni2O3 hole-transport layer through low-temperature solution-processing and its incorporation in the planar configuration of PSC with an efficiency of 17.89%. Generally, self-doping Ni2O3 can significantly reduce the oxygen vacancy in the obtained film, which leads to the existence of a “trap state”. It is well established that the “trap state” induced by a vacancy of oxygen is deleterious to transfer charges. The minimized oxygen vacancy by this self-doping technique provides Ni2O3 film with improved film consistency, increased charge extraction and transport, and minimized charge recombination, all leading to the superior performance of the device. In addition, the optimized devices have less hysteresis than conventional PEDOT:PSS- and NiOx-based PSC. Ni2O3 produced at low temperature and low cost is considered a simple and scalable HTL for the potential commercialization of photovoltaic technology and flexible energy devices based on perovskite.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Materials and reagents
Experimental materials include PbI2, PbCl2, formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium iodide (MAI), PC61BM and BCP, and solvents such as chlorobenzene (CB), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). PEDOT:PSS, nickel acetate tetrahydrate (Ni(CH3CO2)2·4H2O), and nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)26H2O) were purchased from Acros Organics. Ni2O3 (Sol 1) precursor solution was achieved by mixing Ni(CH3CO2)2·4H2O solution with Ni(NO3)26H2O (0.1:0.1 mol L−1) in 2-methoxyethanol and stirring overnight. NiOx (Sol 2) was obtained by 0.1 M solution of Ni(CH3CO2)2·4H2O in 2-methoxyethanol. Solutions of 0.9 M PbI2, 0.1 M PbCl2, 0.85 M MAI, and 0.15 M FAI were obtained in a DMF and DMSO co-solvent (vol. ratio = 0.88: 0.12) in a nitrogen-filled glove box and stirred overnight at room temperature. 20 mg of PC61BM to 1 mL of CB and 0.5 mg of BCP to 1 mL of ethanol were added and mixed overnight at room temperature.
4.2 Device fabrication
An FTO substrate (150 nm thickness) with a resistance of 10–15 Ω sq−1 and size 2 × 2 cm was washed in an ultrasonic cleaning system, using a 60 °C solution with a detergent mixture (Decon 90) and deionized water in a 4% volume ratio, and then washed repeatedly with deionized water. Second, spin coating Sol 1 or Sol 2 was used to prepare HTL at 4500 rpm (45 μL) on an FTO substrate for 45 s and then annealing at 300 °C or 450 °C in a furnace, respectively. Spin coating the perovskite precursor solution (35 μL) deposited the active layer on HTL at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Chlorobenzene (200 μL) was cast vertically after 12 s. The spin-coated film was annealed for 90 s at 50 °C and then moved to another hotplate for annealing at 100 °C for 10 minutes. The deposition of the electron transport layer on the sheet of perovskite was also carried out employing spin coating with solution PC61BM (35 μL) at 5000 rpm for 30 s. The spin coating of the BCP solution (30 μL) at 2000 rpm was followed for 30 s. Eventually, 120 nm Ag was evaporated thermally to form the rear contact. The final area of the fabricated device is 0.1 cm2 as identified by the overlap between the electrodes ITO and Ag.
4.5 Characterization studies
The XRD patterns were obtained using an XRD-7000 X-diffractometer (SHIMADZU, Japan). An STA504 system was used for TGA/DTA. A Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrometer was used for recording the transmittance spectra. Field-scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6700F) was used to determine the grain size of the perovskite film. The spectra of ultraviolet photoelectrons were recorded using a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi system. An electrochemical workstation (660D model, Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd, China) was used to obtain the alternating- (AC) impedance spectrum. The J–V curves were obtained using a Newport simulator (model 94043A) with a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of 100 mW cm−2 simulated light. The +1.2 to − 0.2 V reverse scan was introduced with a voltage step of 10 mV and a delay time of 0 ms. To measure the photocurrent produced from the modulated monochromatic light, a lock-in amplifier (SR-830) was used. Determining the photocurrent and light intensity provided the EQE of the devices.
