    , Accepted 8th February 2020First published on 10th February 2020AbstractInorganic cesium lead halide (CsPbI3) is a promising candidate for next-generation photovoltaic devices, but photoactive α-phase CsPbI3 can rapidly transform to non-photoactive yellow δ-CsPbI3 in a humid atmosphere. Here, we report that partial substitution of cesium by the potassium or rubidium element can effectively improve the phase stability against moisture by forming a water-repelling surface layer with Rb/K segregation. Using density functional theory, we found that the water-induced polarization, which triggers the PbI62− octahedron distortion and accelerates the phase transition, can be effectively alleviated by incorporating Rb/K elements. Further exploration of transition states suggests that Rb/K doped surface layers result in a higher activation barrier for water penetration. The electronic structure analysis further reveals that the barrier enhancement originates from the absence of the participation of inner 5p electrons in Rb/K-H2O binding, which induces a much lower energy barrier in pristine CsPbI3. Based on these improvements, the doped perovskites remained in the major α-phase after direct exposure to ambient air (RH ∼ 30%) for 5 hours, while pristine CsPbI3 showed an irreversible degradation. With the clarified mechanism of enhanced phase stability of Rb/K incorporation, we suggest such a doping method as a promising strategy to be widely applied in the field of photovoltaic devices.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells (OIH-PSCs) are revolutionizing the field of photovoltaics with a rapid progress in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% in 2009 to 25.2% in 2019.1–7 However, OIH-PSCs generally suffer from poor stability due to the volatility and hygroscopicity of the organic cations in the perovskite light-harvesting layer. In order to deal with the vulnerability of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites in ambient air, organic components including methylammonium (MA+) and formamidinium (FA+) have been partially and even totally replaced by inorganic Cs or Rb cations.5,8–11 Recently, all-inorganic perovskite solar cells (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) have gradually come to the forefront of perovskite solar cells and advanced PSCs with a high PCE have been incessantly reported.12–15 CsPbI3 with a cubic structure (α-CsPbI3 or black phase) is considered as the most efficient inorganic photovoltaic material due to its moderate bandgap (∼1.73 eV), but its equilibrium phase at room temperature is yellow δ-CsPbI3 which shows a larger bandgap (∼2.52 eV) and thus no photovoltaic (PV) effect.16 Therefore, the rapid transition from the cubic phase to the non-photoactive orthorhombic phase in ambient air becomes a great challenge for its long-term practical applications.17,18
The mixture halide strategy of incorporating Br− into CsPbI3 has been proposed to stabilize the α-phase of CsPbI3 and obtain a tunable bandgap at the same time, while halide segregation and energetic disorder were also introduced in the mixed-halide perovskite as the major threats to its long-term stability.4,13,19 On the other hand, both the partial substitution of the A-site by small amounts of metal ion additives and the B-site by bismuth or antimony in ABX3 perovskites have also been reported for their exceptional phase stability.20–22 Nevertheless, all of these doping strategies achieve the stabilization of the α-phase perovskite at the expense of PCE, while some only maintain a high PCE by strictly keeping an argon atmosphere or air-free environment during fabrication.20,23 Therefore, facile and effective optimization strategies for the phase stability of neat iodide perovskites are still necessary to be explored, which can also provide further insights into the phase stabilization of various all-inorganic perovskites.
In addition to the experimental efforts for α-phase stabilization, theoretical works have gradually revealed the underlying degradation mechanism in a humid environment. Moisture is regarded as the most fatal factor to the destabilization of the α-phase by introducing vacancies and further lowering the kinetic barrier of the phase transition.16,24 In this regard, such a catalytic effect of moisture is closely related to the interaction mechanism between the perovskite surface and water environment, which has been widely accepted as the first step of the accelerated phase transition.25 Such a reaction process regarding the water intercalation and water diffusion has been investigated by theoretical surface studies, mainly focusing on the surface termination, surface electronic state and dipole orientation of organic atomic groups. Accordingly, recent experiments have paid increasing attention to tuning the surface morphology and modifying interfaces to decelerate the phase transition process and were in good agreement with theoretical works.26–29 A breakthrough regarding the degradation mechanism was made recently, which indicates that as a result of water adsorption and penetration, water-induced polarization and lattice distortion can promote the self-assembly of α-CsPbI3 into a one-dimensional orthorhombic phase.25 However, current theoretical works mainly revolve around elaborating the unstable nature of α-CsPbI3, while there is still a lack of in-depth discussion on the mechanism of enhanced phase stability by effective doping strategies. Therefore, there is still a lot of room for an effective stabilization mechanism to be explored to achieve thorough solutions to the α-phase instability.
Motivated by these studies, we for the first time elaborated the mechanistic origins of the improved humidity stability that arose upon the introduction of other group IA metal element dopants. As a generally accepted compositional engineering approach,10,22,30 experimentally validated potassium incorporation was simulated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to justify the optimization mechanism from an atomistic view; such studies were also performed with regard to untapped rubidium incorporation in the domain of inorganic CsPbI3. Herein, we firstly carried out DFT calculations to compare and distinguish the most stable surfaces in polycrystalline perovskites. Targeting dominant nanostructured surfaces, we performed a simulation on the surface properties of a doped perovskite and kinetic processes of water penetration, which revealed the alleviated polarization and enlarged activation barriers compared to pristine CsPbI3. Detailed electronic structure analysis further identified the involvement of the inner 5p electrons of Cs in the Cs–H2O interaction that will mediate penetration barriers while a similar interaction is lacking in the Rb/K doped system, resulting in a higher energy barrier accordingly. On the basis of theoretical design, we further fabricated the corresponding perovskite films (Cs0.92Rb0.08PbI3/Cs0.92K0.08PbI3), the overall features of which remained intact except for tuned crystallinity, tailored surface stoichiometry and retarded phase transition. With a combination of theoretical design based on first-principles calculations and experimental validations, we saw a role of the incorporated Rb and K in doped CsPbI3, wherein the broad admixture in the surface layer significantly benefits the water-resistance of granular perovskites.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Computational details
First-principles calculation based on density functional theory (DFT) is performed through using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code.31,32 The projector augmented wave (PAW) was adopted to construct potentials to describe the pseudopotential33,34 while the exchange–correlation function is described by generalized gradient approximation (GGA).35 The surfaces of perovskites with different compositions were modeled using a 2 × 2 × 4 slab model (containing 32 formula units), containing eight layers and a vacuum of about 15 Å between each slab. The top three layers and adsorbates are involved in geometry optimization calculations while the bottom five layers were fixed to simulate cubic bulk structures. The water molecule adsorption only takes place on the topmost surface in our slab model and thus we adopted the corresponding dipole correction to correct potential spurious terms caused by the asymmetry of the slabs.36 We determined the position of water adsorption based on the center of mass of water molecules on the surface. The criterion for force convergence was set to −0.01 eV Å−1 to fully relax atomic positions. The kinetic energy cutoff for plane wave expansion is set to 450 eV and gamma cantered Monkhorst–Pack grids37 for each slab model is 3 × 3 × 1. The calculation of the density of states (DOS) was smeared by the Gaussian smearing method with a smearing width of 0.05 eV. The minimum energy pathway of the water penetration process and transition-state structures are computed using the Climbing Image Nudged Elastic Band (CI-NEB) method with six images and two endpoint structures.38 To quantitatively acquire the covalent nature of bonding, we projected plane waves to local orbital basis functions to extract COHP by using the program Local-Orbital Basis Suite Towards Electronic-Structure Reconstruction (LOBSTER).39 The surface energies are calculated according to the following equation:40–43 (1)where γ is the surface energy; Eslab is the total energy of the slabs with two exposed identical surfaces; Eunit represents the total energy of α-CsPbI3 in the bulk phase per formula unit; n denotes the number of α-CsPbI3 units in each slab model and A is the surface area of each identical surface.
2.2. Synthesis
All chemicals and solvents unless specified were purchased from either Sigma-Aldrich or Alfa-Aesar, and used as received without further purification. The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving an appropriate ratio of CsI and PbI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvent. FTO-coated glass substrates (sheet resistance ≈7 Ω sq−1, Nippon, Tokyo, Japan) were ultrasonically washed for 15 minutes sequentially with solvents including detergent, ultra-pure water, acetone and isopropanol. Before deposition, they were treated with oxygen plasma for 5 minutes to further clean the surface of the substrate. The 0.5 M CsPbI3-precursor was filtered before use. 40 μL of hydroiodic acid was added to our precursor solution prior to the spin-coating process to acquire better crystallization.8 Then the solution was spin-coated onto the cleaned substrates by a one-step deposition method at the speed of 2000 rpm for 30 s and they were subsequently annealed at 120 °C for 10 min. For Rb and K incorporation, Cs1−xRbxPbI3 films were fabricated by the same method except for incorporating different quantities of RbI (99.9%) and KI (99.9%) in the precursor solution. We note that all procedures were conducted under fully open-air conditions (humidity ∼30%) at room temperature.
2.3. Characterization
Film morphology and cross-sectional information are acquired from a field emission scanning electron microscope at 5 kV (Zeiss LEO-1530, Germany). XRD patterns were recorded with a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (40 kV, Cu Kα1). TEM images achieved from a Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin (FEI, USA) are adopted to investigate the crystalline information. XPS was carried out on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB 250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA) with Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV) as the source. TG-DSC measurement was carried out on an STA449F3 TG-DSC instrument with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 from 20 to 350 °C and a cooling rate of 3 °C min−1 from 350 to 100 °C in air.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Theoretical simulation on Rb/K doped surfaces and its protection effect against water corrosion
At first we carried out DFT calculations on the representative (100), (200), (110), (220), and (111) surfaces of α-CsPbI3 with low Miller indices. Note that the (100) surfaces and (200) surfaces in this work stand for the (100) surface terminated by Cs–I layer and Pb–I layer, respectively. The surface energies are calculated and shown in Table S1,† which indicates that the (100) and (200) surfaces with less interplanar bonds and longer interplanar spacing possess lower surface energies. Since the electronic structure of the CsPbI3 perovskite plays a significant role in its phase stability and PV applications,29,42,44 the projected density of states (PDOS) of those five surfaces and bulk structures are also plotted, as can be seen in Fig. 1a–f, which reveals that different surfaces have distinct electronic structures. For the (100)/(200) facets, there are no surface states crossing the Fermi level and they exhibit similar electronic structures to bulk α-CsPbI3 only with an increased band gap, which can be primarily attributed to the quantum confinement effect.45 Given such a raised conduction band minimum (CBM), photogenerated electrons in α-CsPbI3 should be effectively extracted from the perovskite layer. The charge density special distribution of the CBM (CDSD-CBM) for the (100) surface is plotted in Fig. 1g and further indicates that conduction states mainly locate on the atoms belonging to the internal bulk phase, thus demonstrating that generated holes tend to gather and transport in the surface layer due to the decreased tendency of recombination. Besides, the clear dumbbell-shaped charge distribution implies that the CBM is mainly composed of I 5p and Pb 6p states, being consistent with the calculated PDOS of the (100) surface, while the CDSD-CBM of the (200) surface has a similar charge distribution pattern, as presented in Fig. S1.† However, all the other planes exhibit clear surface states near the Fermi level, thus being unable to produce photo-generated carriers and losing their intrinsic photoactive properties. Besides, these conducting surface states are usually originated from non-passivated dangling bonds on the surface, further endowing those surface terminations with an unstable nature.46 Thus, all of these findings suggest that the photoactive and stable (100) and (200) planes will dominate over other surfaces.

(g) Charge density special distribution of the CBM (CDSD-CBM) of the (100) surface, where the iso-surface value is set to 0.0005 e Å−3. 
Focusing on the stable (100) and (200) planes, we further investigated the effect of doped atoms on surface properties to show the feasibility of doping strategies in detail. The formation energies of slab models with doped atoms at different layers are calculated and shown in Fig. 2a and b. It is found that doped atoms tend to gather at the surface layer due to the lower formation energy and we can expect that such surface segregation can lead to the variations of surface stoichiometry. With the doped atoms concentrated on the surface layer, the PDOS is presented in Fig. S2,† revealing no obvious differences compared to pristine α-CsPbI3. This is justified from the established fact that A-site cations make negligible contribution to electronic states near the Fermi level, which avoids a series of potential property changes caused by the change of the band structure.47 To investigate the surface properties with Rb/K segregation, we plotted the contour maps of (100) surface longitude dipole moments perpendicular to the slab and surface energies with different Rb/K doping concentrations in Fig. 2c and d respectively. This shows that the reduced surface energy is accompanied by a decreased dipole moment, which is also the same for the (200) surface as shown in Fig. S3.† Compared to Cs, the higher ion potential of Rb/K will induce stronger surface reconstruction, thus alleviating the unfavorable dipole moment caused by surface termination and further decreasing surface energies.26,48–50 In addition, the calculated lattice constants demonstrate the contraction of the cubic volume after Rb/K incorporation, as presented in Table S2,† which can further lead to the enhancement of the stability of α-phase CsPbI3.4,17

We note that the dipole moment here is the total dipole moment perpendicular to the slab model and the contour map is acquired by calculating many different slab models and then doing the interpolation.

To gain further insight into the stabilizing effect of granular α-CsPbI3 by Rb/K incorporation, surface polarization with direct exposure to moisture is discussed on the nanoscale. As a highly polar solvent, the adsorption of water molecules on the surface of α-CsPbI3 can enhance the surface polarization through the following two ways: (1) separation of negative and positive charge centers resulting from the shift of electron clouds distorted by an external electric field; (2) lattice distortion caused by water-induced relaxation. However, the additional polarization due to the water adsorption can be repressed by Rb/K incorporation for both aspects. To demonstrate this point, we have firstly plotted the differential charge density profile of α-CsPbI3 with and without Rb+/K+ incorporation in Fig. S4.† It can be clearly seen that there is a relieved charge shift after doping with Rb/K. Aside from a qualitative comparison, Bader charge analysis is applied to calculate the specific charge value of the corresponding polarized surface (Table S3†). The result also reveals that the charge differences between the cations and anions on the doped surface layer are weakened due to the smaller ionic polarizability of Rb/K under the electric field of water molecules, which can induce a stronger resistance to the water-induced polarization accordingly. On the other hand, lattice distortion (especially for PbI62− octahedra), which is regarded as the first step of the phase transition,51 is also mitigated by the introduction of Rb/K dopants, as shown in Fig. 2e–h. When the water molecule attacks the pristine CsPbI3 (100) surface, the Pb–I bond length stretches from 3.19 Å to 3.27 Å and the I–Pb–I bond angle also deviates by 11° from original 90°, indicating the weakening bond strength along with the significant distortion of the perfect PbI62− octahedra. The configuration of the Rb/K doped surface, however, undergoes a much smaller change under the attack of water and relevant structural information is presented in Table S4.† Such mitigated lattice distortions are also related to the higher ionic potential of the doped atoms since it allows Rb/K to polarize the Pb–I bond and further reduces the bond length, thus maintaining their original structures.22 Therefore, the enhancement of phase stability can be achieved from both the constrained charge shift and the alleviated water-induced distortion of perovskite surfaces.
3.2. Kinetics and thermodynamics of water penetration into perovskites
On the basis of the study on the surface properties of Rb/K doped CsPbI3, a simulation on the kinetic process of water intercalation was carried out based on the climbing image-nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) scheme. Firstly, we built a contour map of the adsorption energy of water molecules on the (100) and (200) surfaces, in order to search for the active sites that were most vulnerable for the water incursion (Fig. S5†). The lowest-energy configuration for water adsorbed on the (100) and (200) surfaces is presented in Fig. 3a and c, which is adopted as the initial configuration for simulating the penetration process. The stable configurations for water intercalated cases are also simulated and shown as Fig. 3b and d, which can serve as the final atomic structures of the penetration process. Then, the energy evolution profiles for water intercalation on the (100) facet and (200) facet are computed and shown as Fig. 3e and f respectively. It can be seen that different facets can induce different activation barriers. For undoped perovskites, the comparison between barrier values clearly indicates that the water penetration is much easier on the (200) facet (0.20 eV) than that on the (100) facet (0.42 eV). As a result, the (200) facet has a much higher probability to be corroded by water molecules. After the Rb/K doping, the activation barriers will be increased on both surfaces, which are also higher than those in organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites,26 clearly suggesting that the introduction of the Rb/K element on the surface can efficiently protect α-CsPbI3 against the water corrosion. Such an effect is especially remarkable for the (200) facet, on which the activation barrier is even comparable to that on the (100) facet (∼0.40 eV). It is worth noting that water molecules have to undergo two barriers when traveling through the (200) surfaces and only the latter one, which is much more energetically expensive than the former (Fig. S6†), has been presented. In addition to the transition states, both surfaces exhibit that the water molecule intercalated final configuration has higher energy and thus is thermodynamically unfavorable compared to the initial configuration. We further simulated the barrier inside the intrinsic CsPbI3, and showed the energy profile in Fig. S7.† The diffusion from octahedral sites to neighboring sites experiences an extremely low barrier as 0.05 eV, which can be easily overcome even under the thermal vibration energy at room temperature. This nearly barrier-free hopping mechanism inside the bulk structure of CsPbI3 further suggests the importance of establishing a surface penetration barrier and the formation of the water-repelling surface. Therefore, our doping strategies can effectively increase the activation barrier to form a stable surface with reduced water reactivity at the very first step of the phase transition.

Partial density of states for the initial and transition states on (c) pristine (100) surface and (d) pristine (200) surface, where the charge density spatial distribution of Cs–O bonding peaks ∼−8 eV are presented in the inset. The Crystal Occupation Hamilton Population (COHP) for the Cs/Rb/K–O bond on (e) (100) surface and (f) (200) surface, where M-ini and M-tran (M = Cs, Rb, K) denote M–O bonds in the initial and transition states respectively. 
The activation barrier depends on the energy variance between the initial and transition states. Compared with the Cs ion, the Rb/K ion can induce quite different electronic interactions with water molecules, which can be viewed as the origin of the barrier enhancement. For both surfaces, the PDOS is used again for analyzing the feature of orbit composition (shown in Fig. 3c and d), while Crystal Occupation Hamilton Population (COHP) analysis is performed to reveal the characteristics on bonding/anti-bonding states (Fig. 3e and f). The PDOS for Cs clearly indicates that inner 5p electrons participate in the binding with the H2O molecule, which can be seen from its strong overlapping with the H–O bonding states around −8 eV for the transition state for the (100) surface and the initial state for the (200) surface. Such an interaction can be visualized by the charge density spatial distribution in the corresponding energy interval, as shown in the inset of Fig. 3c and d. For the K/Rb element, in contrast, the much lower lying inner p electrons associated with higher ionic potential impede the formation of similar bonds. The p electron involving interaction in pristine CsPbI3 can have a mediating effect on the energy relationship between the initial and transition states and lead to a low barrier, which can be further seen from the COHP analysis. As shown in Fig. 3e and f, compared to the Rb/K–O bonds, the Cs–O bond for the initial stage already manifests the remarkable anti-bonding states ∼−6 eV, which will lead to an inferior anchoring ability and weaken the energy difference between the initial and transition stages, while the lower bonding states ∼−8 eV on different surfaces exhibit different features. For the (001) pristine slab (Fig. 3e), the inner 5p states of Cs contribute to a new bonding peak around −8 eV in the transition state, being consistent with the strong overlapping states among the H–O bonds and Cs atoms in PDOS. While for the (002) slab (Fig. 3f), double bonding peaks ∼−8 eV in the initial states also reflect the involvement of inner 5p electrons from Cs, which almost disappear and further result in a significantly enhanced single bonding peak at ∼−8 eV during transition stages. Therefore, both the (001) and (002) pristine surfaces lead to a stronger Cs–O bond in the transition state from such a mediating effect by the inner 5p electrons in Cs, thus stabilizing water molecules and inducing a weakened water penetration resistance accordingly. While this inner p electron modulation along with a low energy barrier can be avoided through incorporating Rb/K with a much tighter inner p shell.
The evolution of charge transfer, and the electronic and geometric structures of the water molecules can also determine the magnitude of the penetration barrier. The charge evolution of hydrogen atoms and oxygen atoms in water molecules is shown in Fig. S8† for the (100) and (200) surfaces respectively. The variance of the net charge on H and O atoms clearly indicates that the electron migrates from the O atom to the H atom when overcoming the transition state, thus weakening the O–H bond strength and causing the increased total energy. Evolution of DOS is also illustrated (Fig. S9†), and it can be seen that the strongly overlapping H–O bonding states at ∼−8 eV are weakened during the penetration process, thus leading to a high energy barrier, which is more remarkable for the Rb/K doped surface and consistent with charge transfer evolution. Additionally, considering the water molecules can also rotate by themselves in this process, the rotation of the H–O–H bond and varying the H–O bond length also contribute to the penetration barrier. Table S5† shows the geometric structures of water molecules at different diffusion stages, demonstrating both the obvious elongation of the H–O bond and the significant increasing of H–O–H bond angle. Besides the electronic structure, it can also be resulted from the shrunk surficial hollow cage induced by Rb/K dopants, which will block the penetration of water molecules due to lack of space in the surface layer. To conclude, both the characteristics of the Cs/Rb/K–O interaction and the electronic and geometric states of the penetrated H2O molecules reveal the origin of the formation of a water-repelling surface in the Rb/K doped system.
3.3. Experimental validation of improved phase stability caused by Rb/K doped surfaces
To experimentally verify our doping strategies, the perovskite films were spin-coated with a precursor solution containing different concentrations of Rb+ or K+. We added a small quantity of hydroiodic acid to our solution in order to achieve uniform polycrystalline formation and improve solubility.8 Considering the similar ionic radii of Rb and K (1.52 Å and 1.38 Å) and their adjacency in the IA group, it can be predicted that Rb/K incorporation can induce similar effects on the crystalline structure of perovskites. Taking Rb incorporation as an example, we firstly employed the XRD technique to evaluate the phase structure differences between perovskite films with different Rb concentrations (Cs1−xRbxPbI3, x = 0, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12). As shown in Fig. 4a, the XRD pattern of a pure CsPbI3 film exhibits two major diffraction peaks at 14.2° and 28.7° and a minor peak located at 20.2°, which correspond to the (100), (200) and (110) planes of the pure α-CsPbI3 phase, respectively.9 The dominant proportion of the (100) and (200) planes resulted from their stable electronic structures, in good agreement with our refined PDOS simulation results. Additionally, the fact that two major perovskite peaks got boosted with the induction of 8% Rb/K dopants provides proof for the enhanced crystallization, in accordance with the effect of the previous doping strategies of small amounts of metal ions on tuning crystallization,52 whereas the observed weaker peaks strongly suggest the partial collapse of the cubic perovskite when the doping concentration surpasses 10%, which can be attributed to the smaller atom radius of the dopant and inappropriate tolerance factor. Besides, a closer look at the (100) peak shows a shift to a higher angle and thus indicates again the contraction of the cubic volume as shown in Fig. 4b. To further analyze the crystalline nanostructure information, the representative high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of α-CsPbI3 with rubidium incorporation (Cs0.92Rb0.08PbI3) are shown in Fig. 4c with clear lattice fringes. The interplanar distance of 0.62 ± 0.01 nm could be indexed as the (100) plane spacing in the cubic CsPbI3 phase, exhibiting a high level of crystallization with a strong preferred [100] direction. Besides, in fast Fourier transform of the HRTEM image shown in the inset, only one set of cubic diffraction patterns further validates a strong crystallization of the pure α-phase with Rb incorporation along with the contracted cubic volume. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were then employed to obtain information about the elements contained in the surface layer of the cubic perovskite with Rb/K incorporation, as can be seen in Fig. 4d and e. The proportion of different elements in a thin surface layer acquired from XPS analysis is listed in Table 1 and the observed higher Rb/K doping concentration in the surface layer supports our prediction of the surface segregation. In addition, a closer look at the XPS peak positions of Pb 4f, I 3d and Cs 3d is also shown in Fig. S10.† We observed a slight shift of the Pb 4f and I 3d peaks to a higher binding energy, suggesting the higher oxidation state of lead and iodine. Such an improved oxidation state of base elements indicates the lower oxidation state of doping Rb/K as predicted by the previous Bader charge analysis, while an increase of Pb cationic charge can play a role in shrinking the octahedral volume of PbI6, which helps Cs-site cations hold the PbI6 octahedra better. This can also provide evidence for a more compact structure and a relieved charge shift after doping with Rb/K.

The morphology and microstructure of perovskite films were then investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As shown in Fig. 4f, the pristine CsPbI3-based film showed poor coverage and separated grains, which usually led to an inferior photoactive layer owing to a large number of defects. By comparison, Fig. 4g reveals a blurred grain boundary and uniform grains with the induction of 8% Rb. The closely packed polycrystalline grains are propitious to form less defects and a smoother surface. According to the energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) mapping shown in Fig. S11,† Cs, Rb/K, Pb, and I homogeneously exist in all grains instead of separate chemical phases, suggesting that morphology refinement can be attributed to the uniform addition of rubidium or potassium in CsPbI3 polycrystalline thin films. Analogous to the XRD patterns, 12% Rb incorporation (Fig. S12†), however, will lead to a poor morphology and increased pin-holes, indicative of the adverse effects of a high doping concentration on the film quality. XPS spectra, SEM and TEM images, and XRD patterns of α-CsPbI3 with potassium incorporation (Cs0.92K0.08PbI3) can be found in Fig. S13 and Table S6,† exhibiting similar effects to Rb incorporation. Therefore, we can obtain perovskite films with an enhanced crystallinity, tuned surface stoichiometry and better morphology after a moderate amount of Rb/K incorporation.
To further prove our theoretical prediction regarding their activation barrier in water incursion, we identified the composition and monitored the dynamics of the phase transition process by XRD (Fig. 5a and b). Bare perovskite films with and without Rb/K dopants are stored in ambient air (RH ∼ 30%), and it can be clearly seen that the rates of phase transitions are fundamentally different. The pure CsPbI3 film underwent a rapid phase transition within the first half an hour as confirmed by the new diffraction peaks located around 26° corresponding to the δ-CsPbI3 phase. The undoped black α-CsPbI3 film gradually and visibly turned transparent and light yellow. After 5 hours, it showed an even lower peak intensity of α-CsPbI3 and higher δ-CsPbI3 reflections, indicating a great phase transition in the first 5 hours. Under the exposure for 5 days, the films became completely yellow and nearly all α-CsPbI3 transformed to δ-CsPbI3 since the XRD pattern exhibits stronger reflections of δ-CsPbI3 and the disappeared peaks at 14.0°, 28.3°. Further decomposition leads to the formation of yellow PbI2, which corresponds to the diffraction peaks at 12.5°. In contrast, Rb-doped CsPbI3 exhibited a nearly unchanged peak intensity after 0.5 h storage and much stronger reflections of the cubic phase than pure CsPbI3 still remained after a lasting exposure for 5 hours to ambient air. To further obtain direct evidence on phase stability, SEM surface images are revealed in Fig. 5c and d to illustrate the morphology and microstructure inside the polycrystalline thin films after exposure to air for 5 hours. Grains slide along the original grain boundaries and part from one another in the top view of pure CsPbI3, while we can still observe uncorroded grain boundaries in Rb/K doped perovskites. Increased grain connectivity and less pin-holes in the SEM images of Cs0.92Rb0.08PbI3 and Cs0.92K0.08PbI3 films indicate the protection of grain boundaries, which has been theoretically and experimentally attributed to the consolidated surface layer of grains with Rb/K accumulation. Similar strategies to anchor grain boundaries or introduce a crosslink between neighboring grains also demonstrated the effectiveness of consolidated interfaces.53,54 Therefore, the retarded corrosion of grain boundaries and the improved phase stability in a humid atmosphere observed in the experiments further validated the formation of the predicted effective water-repelling surface.

(f) and (g) show the TEM images of the pure CsPbI3 sample in the δ- and α-phase, respectively. 
We finally performed thermogravimetric/differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) to examine the thermodynamics of the reversible phase transition between α-phase and δ-phase CsPbI3. Cs0.92Rb0.08PbI3 and Cs0.92K0.08PbI3 powders are loaded in ceramic crucibles in air. Fig. 5e illustrates an exothermic change of pure CsPbI3 around 300 °C at a cooling rate of 3 °C min−1, which is commonly regarded as the conversion from the α-phase into the enthalpically favored δ-phase.16 After doping with 8% K and Rb, the appearance of the δ-phase occurs 40 °C and 50 °C later than the transition temperature of pure CsPbI3 powders, indicative of the stabilization of the α-phase with Rb/K incorporation in the presence of moisture. And all three samples share similar enthalpy changes by measuring the area under these exothermic features, indicating that doped Rb/K atoms do not affect the transition thermodynamically. Therefore, the delayed phase transition is mainly contributed from the enhanced kinetic energy barrier rather than other thermodynamic factors, in accordance with our first-principles calculations. The TEM images of the pure CsPbI3 sample in the α- and δ-phase are demonstrated in Fig. 5f and g to illustrate the phase structures before and after the transition in the DSC curves. Notably, δ-phase CsPbI3 reveals a self-assembled nanorod-shaped morphology instead of granular structures like α-CsPbI3 because of the preferred growth orientation along [001].25 TG curves (Fig. S14†) show no obvious change during the cyclic process except for slight PbI2 sublimation over 300 °C, indicating the exceptional thermal stability of the inorganic perovskite.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we systematically investigated the effect of Rb/K incorporation on the moisture resistance of α-phase CsPbI3 by both first-principles calculations and experimental validations. We studied the surface properties of the representatives with a low Miller index and focused on the (100) facets with two different terminations, both of which not only possess low formation energies along with similar electronic structures to the bulk phase, but also exhibit surface segregation and reduced surface polarization when incorporating Rb/K dopants. By introducing a water molecule adsorbed on the surface layer, we theoretically investigated the water-induced surface polarization and the kinetic process of water penetration. The results clearly show that the incorporation of Rb/K cations will lead to a mitigated charge shift, alleviated lattice distortion and a higher activation barrier accordingly. The atomic configuration and charge distribution of water molecules are investigated at different penetrating stages, which revealed the formation of a water-repelling surface and thus a retarded phase transition. By partial substitution of cesium by potassium and rubidium (Cs0.92Rb0.08PbI3/Cs0.92Rb0.08PbI3), we obtained perovskite films with a tuned morphology and tailored lattice constant by a one-step deposition method. Based on such prepared films, we experimentally proved the surface accumulation of the doping element (Rb/K) and the effective improvement of moisture-resistance by monitoring the dynamics and identifying compositions during the phase transition process. Therefore, the proved phase stability against moisture caused by Rb/K incorporation can be reasonably attributed to the formation of a water-repelling surface. This study not only elaborates the underlying mechanism of the enhanced phase stability of α-phase CsPbI3 in ambient air after Rb/K incorporation, but also provides a new perspective for investigating effective solutions to the long-term stability of inorganic PSCs.

We note that the dipole moment here is the total dipole moment perpendicular to the slab model and the contour map is acquired by calculating many different slab models and then doing the interpolation. The optimized structure of (e) pristine (100) surface, (f) K incorporated (100) surface, (g) pristine (200) surface and (h) K incorporated (200) surface.	 

 	Fig. 3  Calculated energy barrier of the water penetration process for (a) (100) surface and (b) (200) surface, where the corresponding initial (left) and final (right) atomic configurations are shown above. Partial density of states for the initial and transition states on (c) pristine (100) surface and (d) pristine (200) surface, where the charge density spatial distribution of Cs–O bonding peaks ∼−8 eV are presented in the inset. The Crystal Occupation Hamilton Population (COHP) for the Cs/Rb/K–O bond on (e) (100) surface and (f) (200) surface, where M-ini and M-tran (M = Cs, Rb, K) denote M–O bonds in the initial and transition states respectively.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) XRD patterns and (b) a closer look at the (100) peaks of perovskite films with different concentrations of Rb incorporation; (c) HRTEM image of granular Cs0.92Rb0.08PbI3 with its fast Fourier transform pattern in the inset; (d) complete and (e) Rb scan XPS spectra of the surface layer of the Cs0.92Rb0.08PbI3 film; top views of the SEM images of (f) pure CsPbI3 and (g) 8% doped CsPbI3 films.
