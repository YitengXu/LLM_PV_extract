    AbstractA new series of neutral, thiocyanate-free Ru(II) sensitizers (TFRS-1–3), which are assembled using both 4,4′-carboxy-2,2′-bypyridine and 2-pyridyl pyrazolate ancillaries, exhibit a light-harvesting capability up to 700 nm and superior DSSC performance in conversion efficiency (η = 9.54% for TFRS-2).
The urgent need to move towards a low carbon economy has initiated unprecedented interest in renewable energy sources, among which the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) represents one of the most promising technologies, by virtue of their low fabrication expenses and good power conversion efficiencies.1 A DSSC is a photoelectrochemical device, which contains a tailor-made light-absorbing sensitizer deposited on the nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanode and, in most cases, the employment of iodine/iodide redox couple for transport of electrical charge, and platinum in the counter electrode.2 In these applications, the Ru(II) metal based sensitizers exhibit superior efficiencies, extending into double digits under AM 1.5 global illumination.3 However, the thiocyanate ligands incorporated in most of the Ru(II) sensitizers are believed to provide the weakest dative bonding within the metal complexes, making the sensitizers unstable under excessive thermal stress and/or light soaking.4 This latent inferiority then triggered studies to replace thiocyanate with other effective chelating chromophores in an effort to extend the lifespan of practical solar devices. Although the initial attempt gave only limited success,5 a superior conversion efficiency of 10.1% is now documented in the new sensitizer by incorporating 2,4-difluorophenyl pyridinato ancillary ligands.6 Herein, we report the preparation of another new class of thiocyanate-free Ru(II) sensitizers by virtue of analogous pyridyl pyrazolate ancillaries.7
The ethyl ester derivative of TFRS-1 was first prepared by direct treatment of [Ru{4,4′-bis(ethoxycarbonyl)-2,2′-bipyridine}(p-cymene)Cl]·Cl and 2-(3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)pyridine in refluxing 2-methoxyethanol. After chromatographic separation on a SiO2 column with pure CH2Cl2, it was then hydrolyzed with 1 M NaOH solution at 100 °C for 24 h. The desired complex TFRS-1 was obtained after neutralization and triturating with deionized water, CH2Cl2 and diethyl ether in sequence; yield: 32%. Other functionalized sensitizers TFRS-2 and 3 were prepared under a similar condition, using the respective 5-hexylthiophene and 5-hexyl [2,2′]bithiophene substituted pyridyl pyrazoles. Their structural drawings are depicted in Scheme 1, according to the 1H NMR and other spectroscopic means. It is notable that the pyrazolate and pyridyl fragments in TFRS-1–3 are all located at the mutual trans and cis-disposition, reminiscent of the ligand arrangement of analogous Ir(III) metal complexes carrying two pyridyl azolate chelates.8
 Scheme 1  Structural drawing of Ru(II) sensitizers TFRS-1–3. 
The absorption spectra of TFRS-1, 2 and 3 in DMF are depicted in Fig. 1 and the numerical data are summarized in Table 1. Note that the spectral data of N719 are also attached for reference. In addition to the higher energy ππ* absorptions, the parent complex TFRS-1 exhibits two absorptions at 406 and 532 nm attributable to the metal-to-ligand charge transfer bands (MLCT) mixed with a small amount of ligand-to-ligand charge transfer contribution (vide infra). Moreover, upon introduction of 5-hexylthiophene and 5-hexyl [2,2′]bithiophene groups to TFRS-1, forming TFRS-2 and TFRS-3, the lower energy MLCT absorption at ∼530 nm remains unchanged, whereas the higher energy band at 406 nm splits into two bands at 424 and 460 for TFRS-2 and at 439 and 503 nm for TFRS-3, together with a drastic increase of molar extinction coefficient for these bands, showing the effect of extending π-conjugation of the pyridyl pyrazolate chelates. This viewpoint could be further supported by theoretical calculations (see details in the ESI†). Using TFRS-2 as a paradigm, Fig. 2 depicts the selected optically active electronic transitions (black bars). According to the calculations, the absorption bands in the higher energy region of 410–440 nm are ascribed to S10–S15 excitation, for which the frontier orbital analyses indicate that electron density, in part, is distributed around the thiophene moiety (see electron-hole density at 412 nm, Fig. 2).

Cyclic voltammetry was then performed to ensure that the LUMOs of all complexes are suited for injecting electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 and to verify whether their HOMOs match the redox potential of the electrolyte. As shown in Table 1, their onset potential for oxidation appeared in the range 0.84–0.91 V (vs. NHE), which are due to the Ru(II) metal oxidation. The data reveal that the I−/I3− redox couple (ca. 0.4 V vs. NHE) is more negative than the respective HOMOs and is able to regenerate the dye efficiently. The LUMO energy levels, estimated from the difference of HOMO and the onset of the optical energy gap, are also sufficiently more negative than the conduction band edge of the TiO2 electrode (ca. −0.5 V vs. NHE).
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of these DSSC dyes are shown in Fig. 3A. The onsets of the IPCE spectra are all close to ∼780 nm, and excellent IPCE performance was observed from 420 to 660 nm, among which both TFRS-1 and N719 show the maximum of 74% at 537 and 560 nm, while it increases to ∼84% at 460–580 nm range for TFRS-2, and slightly reduced to a value of 80% for TFRS-3. These results reveal that these newly developed TFRS sensitizers exhibit superior light harvesting capability versus that of N719.

Fig. 3B shows the photocurrent density–voltage curve of the DSSC devices under AM1.5 G simulated sunlight at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The N719 solar cells were made according to the optimized parameters of the literature, showing short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF) and overall conversion efficiency (η) to be 15.64 mA cm−2, 760 mV, 0.72 and 8.56%, respectively. It is notable that this conversion efficiency is lower than the best data of N719 (i.e.η = 11.18%) documented in the literature.9 Despite this deficiency, the TFRS sensitized solar cell was endowed with a ∼10% increase in efficiency, compared with our N719 reference. For instance, the TFRS-1 gives JSC = 15.95 mAcm−2, VOC = 830 mV, and FF = 0.693, corresponding to an overall η = 9.18%. The much higher VOC observed versus that of N719 could be due to the replacement of thiocyanates with 2-pyridyl pyrazolate chelate; the latter should form a better insulating motif for blocking the dark current. Furthermore, the thiophene containing TFRS-2 and TFRS-3 show higher current density of 17.15 and 17.38 mA cm−2, respectively, than that of 15.95 mA cm−2 in the parent TFRS-1. The result may be rationalized by an increase of molar extinction coefficient upon extending the thiophene π-conjugation.10 However, the relatively larger molecular size of TFRS-2 and 3 would also reduce dye-loading on the TiO2 surface, giving a slightly increased dark current and lowered VOC.11 This could be attributed to the electron recombination occurring in the photoelectrodes where many unfilled voids were generated by the ineffective packing of larger dyes. To confirm this delineation, we measured the amounts of dyes absorbed on TiO2 film. The totals are 4.43, 2.52, and 1.09 × 10−8 mol cm−2 for TFRS-1, 2, and 3, respectively. Overall, among all three sensitizers, TFR-2 represents the best performance with JSC = 17.15 mA cm−2, VOC = 820 mV, and FF = 0.678, corresponding to an overall conversion efficiency η = 9.54%. This data is 11.4% greater than that (8.56%, see Table 1) of the N719 reference solar cell fabricated in this study.
To gain more insight into the DSSC property, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was then performed to analyze the effects on charge generation, transport and collection. Fig. 4 depicts the impedance spectra of DSSCs fabricated with TFRS-1–3 and N719 reference cell in the dark under forward bias (−0.79 V). As a result, the radius of these semicircles revealed an order of TFRS-1 (104.55 Ω) > TFRS-2 (95.48 Ω) > TFRS-3 (85.35 Ω) > N719 (66.94 Ω), indicating that the recombination process from the as prepared TFRS dye-sensitized solar cells is slower than that of the N719 sensitizer, leading to the higher photovoltage of TFRS dyes.12 The results are also consistent with the measured VOC values listed in Table 1. Finally, the lifespan of solar cells fabricated with TFRS-2 was examined using a long-term accelerated aging experiment under accelerated visible-light soaking at 60 °C. After 1000 h illumination, the device efficiency changed only slightly for all the parameters: JSC: 14.34 to 14.96 mAcm−2, VOC: 770 to 680 mV, FF: 0.602 to 0.621 and η: 6.65 to 6.32% (see Fig. S5 of ESI†) supporting the superior advantage of thiocyanate-free, charge-neutral Ru(II) sensitizers suited for dye-sensitized solar cells.

In summary, promising device performance data have been obtained with the new design of thiocyanate-free sensitizers TFRS-1–3; the highest power conversion efficiencies are close to 9.5% for TFRS-2. This result eliminates the need for proximal contact between the soft sulfur atom of thiocyanate and electron donor in electrolyte for effective regeneration of dyes. Further development is versatile and of great perspective. In principle, dye molecules with functional fragments pointing toward the direction of the electrolyte, as long as they can effectively accept an electron, should be suitable for making highly efficient solar cells.
