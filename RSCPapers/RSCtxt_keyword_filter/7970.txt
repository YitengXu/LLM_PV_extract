    , Accepted 8th January 2020First published on 8th January 2020AbstractA blue organic near infrared (NIR) absorbing sensitizer, AP25, is investigated for use in broadly absorbing dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). AP25 shows solar-to-electric conversion with an onset near 900 nm in DSC devices and a photocurrent near 25 mA cm−2 when co-sensitized. An all-organic SSM-DSC device reaches 10.3% PCE.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are unique compared to many photovoltaic technologies in terms of attractive aesthetics, indoor/low light applications, and day long performance.1–3 The sensitizer in DSC devices is critical in controlling photon absorption, electron injection, charge separated lifetimes, and undesired recombination losses.4,5 Organic D–π–A sensitizers offer the advantage of modular synthesis, relatively simple purifications, and band gap engineering to tune the light harvesting capabilities.6 An ideal DSC sensitizer should be able to absorb photons across the visible spectrum and significantly far into the near infrared (NIR) region of the solar spectrum using photons lower in energy than 750 nm efficiently.7,8 Additionally, the sensitizer should provide functionality to insulate the photoelectrode (most commonly TiO2-based) surface from oxidants in the electrolyte as a barrier to interfacial recombination losses.9–11
Proaromatic functionality allows for the incorporation of aromatic groups in the excited-state which lowers the energy needed for photoexcitation. Thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (3,4-TT) is a proaromatic π-bridge which can allow NIR photon-to-electric conversion when used in intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) dye designs.12,13 When combined with strongly donating triarylamine (TAA) groups and a cyanoacrylic acid (CAA) group, we have shown 3,4-TT can absorb photons as low in energy as 700 nm.14 Introduction of an added thiophene or furan π-bridge between the TAA group and the 3,4-TT group bathochromically shifted the photon absorption onset from 700 nm to 800 nm. Interestingly, these dyes retained favorable energetics for electron transfers within DSC devices upon addition of secondary π-bridge functionality. The AP25 dye design seeks to further increase the conjugated π-system through the introduction of a cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) in place of thiophene or furan as the secondary π-bridge (Fig. 1). CPDT is chosen due to the literature demonstrating excellent ICT events with this bridge for high molar absorptivities and low energy light absorption. Additionally, CPDT has a convenient position for rapid alkylations resulting in a three-dimensional geometry at the π-bridge for 4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDTEtHx) which can reduce dye–dye aggregation and promote TiO2 surface protection in multiple directions.10,15

AP25 was synthesized in 4 steps from intermediates known in the literature as detailed in the ESI† (Scheme S1).12,16 Absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical measurements were undertaken with AP25 to access the suitability of AP25 for DSC devices (Fig. 1 and Table 1). AP25 is observed to have a broad absorption band across the visible and near-infrared region extending from 500 nm to 800 nm in dichloromethane. AP25 has an absorption maximum (λmax) of 660 nm and an absorption onset (λonset) of 780 nm found from drawing a tangent line on the low energy side of the absorption spectrum (Fig. S1, ESI†). This corresponds to a bathochromic shift from 665 nm to 780 nm relative to a prior reported analogue (PB1) without the CPDT π-bridge (Fig. S1, ESI†).12 The bathochromically shifted absorption spectrum is accompanied by an increase in the molar absorptivity of AP25 compared to PB1 (30000 M−1 cm−1vs. 26000 M−1 cm−1), which suggest the introduction of the CPDT π-bridge enhances ICT across the molecule.10

Electrochemical analysis via cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S2, ESI†) reveals that the bathochromic shift upon addition of the CPDT π-bridge is due an decrease in the ground-state oxidation potential (E(S+/S)) of the dye by 280 mV presumably due to the electron rich nature of the CPDT group (0.81 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) for AP25vs. 1.09 V for PB1, Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†).16,17 Taking the triiodide/iodide (I3−/I−) redox shuttle at 0.35 V, this allows for a free-energy of regeneration (ΔGreg) of 460 mV.17,18 An excited-state oxidation potential (E(S+/S*)) of −0.78 V was found through the equation E(S+/S*) = E(S+/S) − Eoptg, where Eoptg is the optical energy gap found from the onset of the absorption spectrum. This corresponds to a free energy for electron injection (ΔGinj) into the TiO2 conduction band (CB) of approximately 280 mV when the TiO2 CB is taken at −0.5 V versus NHE, which is near the minimum driving force needed for fast electron transfer.18,19 In terms of thermodynamic electron injection and dye regeneration free energies, AP25 has minimal free energy losses. In comparison with well known benchmark sensitizers N719 and black dye (Fig. S1, ESI†), the adopted design strategy resulted in good energetics with less energy loss due to injection or regenerative overpotentials and an electronic absorption with a higher molar absorptivity (Table S1, ESI†).20,21 Additionally, density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level show the HOMO delocalized on the TAA, CPDT, and 3,4-TT (lesser amount) groups (Fig. S3, ESI†). The LUMO extends from the CAA group to the CPDT group as expected for an ICT system. The HOMO is well positioned far from the TiO2 anchor to promote extended charge separation after interfacial charge transfer, and the LUMO is well positioned spatially for efficient charge transfer to TiO2. Time-dependant (TD)-DFT shows very close agreement with experiment for the vertical transition comparison to λmax (1.86 vs. 1.88 eV) indicating this model is a reasonable approximation of the dye properties (Table S2, ESI†).

AP25 was tested in DSC devices via current density–voltage (J–V) curve and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements (Table 2 and Fig. 2). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) was calculated according to the equation PCE = (Jsc × Voc × FF)/I0 where, Jsc is the short-circuit current density, Voc is the open-circuit voltage, FF is the fill factor and I0 is the intensity of the incident light (1 sun, air mass 1.5G). AP25 in a single dye DSC device shows a broad IPCE response from 350 nm to near 900 nm (Fig. 2) with a peak IPCE value of 75%. The bathochromic shift in absorption onset on TiO2 films from 800 nm (Fig. S15b, ESI†) to 900 nm (Fig. 2) for the IPCE of AP25 is most likely caused by additives in the electrolyte (Fig. S15c, ESI†).22 This panchromatic IPCE spectrum corresponds to a high Jsc of 19.9 mA cm−2 (see ESI† for device optimization discussion). Notably, IPCE onsets beyond 850 nm and IPCE peak conversions in excess of 60% have rarely been observed in literature for organic dyes.17,23,24AP25 represents a notable step forward with regard to broad IPCE and NIR dyes with a record setting JSC value obtained. In fact, the IPCE breadth and photocurrent output of AP25 is higher than many well-known broadly absorbing Ru(II) metal sensitizers.25,26 A noticeable drop in the IPCE spectrum is present in the 400–550 nm region of AP25 DSC devices (Fig. 2) due to an inherent lack of photon absorption as observed in the absorption spectrum for AP25 in solution (Fig. 1) and on dye anchored TiO2 films (Fig. S15, ESI†). Thus, co-sensitization with an orange dye (D35) with complimentary light absorption in the region of the AP25 spectrum where a minimum is observed at ∼450 nm on TiO2 can increase photocurrents (Fig. S15, ESI†).9,27–33 An AP25 + D35 DSC device gives a photocurrent of 21.4 mA cm−2, an 8.0% overall PCE, and a peak IPCE of 80% with better photon conversion in the 400–550 nm region without loss in conversion at lower energy wavelengths (Table 2 and Fig. 2). AP25 and D35 synergistically resulting in better surface protection as evidenced by an increased photovoltage for AP25 + D35 DSC devices, larger charge transfer resistance at the dye–TiO2 interface to the redox shuttle via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements (Fig. S4, ESI†), and a longer lifetime of electrons in TiO2 as observed with small modulated photovoltage transient measurements (Table 2 and Fig. S4, ESI†). Addition of a “cyclized transparent optical polymer (CYTOP)” with siloxane end caps (M-type) as an anti-reflective film to the AP25 + D35 DSC device enhanced light transmission through the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass electrode for an observed peak photocurrent of 24.5 mA cm−2, which shows (1) the highest Jsc value we are aware of for an organic sensitizer DSC, (2) a higher Jsc than well-known precious-metal dyes such as N719 and black dye, (3) one of the highest known Jsc values for any DSC system comparable only to some recent ruthenium and osmium systems, and (4) a higher Jsc than that observed from high efficiency perovskite solar cells (Table S7 and Fig. S14, ESI†).17,34,35 Extending electricity production further into the NIR with high Jsc values is critical for multijunction systems working in unison with other solar cell technologies, and this ∼25 mA cm−2 device is a significant finding in this direction (further demonstration below). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the dark and electron lifetime measurements by small modulation photovoltage transient method (SMPVT) results are discussed in supplemental information (Section 6, Fig. S4–S13 and Tables S3–S6, ESI†).

The AP25 + D35 DSC device IPCE onset of 895 nm with up to 24.5 mA cm−2 of photocurrent is attractive for use as a back cell in sequential series multijunction-DSCs (SSM-DSCs, Fig. 3, Fig. S17–S19 (ESI†) and Table 3).36,37 SSM-DSCs are mechanically stacked single illuminated area series connected devices which exploit a photon management strategy in individual subcells by selecting the TiO2 film thickness, order of sensitizer illumination based on absorption breadth, and redox shuttle.36,37 SSM-DSCs can lead to a higher overall PCE than individual devices if the absorption components are carefully selected to match subcell photocurrents.38,39 For a two subcell SSM-DSC device, a top subcell based on the D35 dye and Co(bpy)33+/2+ redox shuttle was selected due to the IPCE range of 400–650 nm for this device using half of the photons available to a AP25 + D35 subcell (Fig. S20–S23, ESI†). This translates to a PCE >10% for a metal-free dye based SSM-DSC device for the first time with Voc output of 1.47 V.40

For a three subcell organic dye based SSM-DSC device employing MK2 (Fig. S20 and S23, IPCE onset 750 nm, ESI†) as a middle subcell red dye with a Co(bpy)33+/2+ redox shuttle, an ∼10% PCE was maintained with an increase in photovoltage to 2120 mV (Fig. 3, Table 3, Tables S10 and S11, ESI†). This example highlights the value of the AP25 + D35 DSC device since the prior report on two and three subcells systems with D35 and organic dyes have reached only 7.1% and 7.0% PCE due to absorption breadth limitations of the back subcell. Further, AP25 + D35 ourperforms metal complex sensitizers as the back cell due to its efficient NIR response beyond 750 nm (Table 3, 8.7% and 9.3% PCE compared to 10.3% and 10.1% for two-subcell and three-subcell SSM-DSC devices, respectively).40 In fact, the AP25 + D35 subcell has enabled the fabrication of a precious metal free solar-to-fuel electrolysis system.41
A simple to synthesize, blue colored organic sensitizer gave a broad solar-to-electric response with onset at 895 nm in DSC devices. Efficient and panchromatic current generation throughout the IPCE spectrum (350–900 nm) is possible with the use of a dye comprised of a proaromatic (3,4-TT) π-bridge, a highly alkylated TAA donor, and an electron rich CPDT π-bridge. The AP25 optical and electrochemical properties observed show good energetics for use in DSC devices. An overall power conversion efficiency of 6.8% for AP25 was improved to 8.4% by co-sensitization with an orange dye and the use of a CYTOP anti-reflective coating. PCE values of >10% were achieved when AP25 + D35 based DSC were used as back subcells in SSM-DSC devices with front D35 subcells. With an aesthetically attractive blue color, AP25 offers an approach to a highly efficient and broad absorbing organic dye.
