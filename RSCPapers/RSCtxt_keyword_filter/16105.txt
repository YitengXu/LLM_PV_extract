1 Introduction
Organic semiconductors have attracted considerable attention over the past few decades due to their attractive advantages such as light weight, low cost and easy processing, which make them find potential applications in large-area flexible organic devices/circuits.1–3 Among them, organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), a key component of organic electronics, have shown remarkable progress4–6 with the field-effect mobility significantly increased from the initial value7 of 10–6–10–5 cm2 V−1 s−1 to the state-of-art value of 43 cm2 V−1 s−1 for small-molecule semiconductors8 and 36.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for polymer semiconductors.9 In the development of high performance OFETs, recently, bi/multi-functional OFETs, where two or more types of physical properties are combined together in a single device, have also received increasing interest due to their scientific and technological significance in organic electronic integration, for example organic phototransistors (OPTs).10–14 The concept of phototransistors was first proposed by William Shockley in 1951.15 Compared to photodiodes, phototransistors can exhibit much higher sensitivity and lower noise due to the unique working mechanism of field-effect transistors. Moreover, phototransistors combine light detection and signal amplification together in a single device, and can be easily integrated into various optoelectronic devices/circuits, such as light switches, light memory, light detectors, etc., as shown in Fig. 1.10

OPTs are generally divided into two types, such as small-molecule OPTs (SOPTs) and polymer OPTs (PPTs) depending on the types of active layers. Recently, the photoresponsivity of SOPTs has already reached up to 12000 A W−1, which is comparable to that of inorganic phototransistors.13 Over the past several years, great achievements have also been made in PPTs under the considerable efforts of chemical scientists for the development of polymer semiconductors and device physicists for the improvement of device fabrication techniques.14,16 In comparison with small molecules, polymer semiconductors exhibit much better solution-processing ability, and compatibility with plastic substrates. Moreover, from a molecular perspective, conjugated polymers have much larger conjugation length and broader optical absorption, which enable them to be more beneficial for optoelectronic devices.13,14 In this MiniRev, we attempt to present a systematic summary of these significant advances in PPTs. In section 2, we will first give a brief introduction with the purpose of offering an intuitive understanding of OPTs including typical structural geometry, working mechanism and basic performance parameters. In section 3, we will focus on the specific research progress of PPTs including the development of material systems and the improvement of device physics. Finally, the exploration of flexible devices and circuits based on PPTs and concise perspectives and conclusion are also briefly demonstrated.
2 A brief illustration of OPTs
In order to give a comprehensive understanding of OPTs, in this section, we will first briefly outline the fundamentals of device structures, working principles and basic performance parameters of OPTs.
2.1 Device structures of OPTs
The device structures of OPTs are mainly derived from that of OFETs, and also consist of four typical structures: bottom-gate/top-contact (BGTC), bottom-gate/bottom-contact (BGBC), top-gate/top-contact (TGTC) and top-gate/bottom-contact (TGBC), according to the relative positions of the dielectric layer, active organic layer and source/drain electrodes. The only difference in OPTs from OFETs is the fourth terminal, light illumination incorporated in the device geometry. According to the position of light illumination, the structures can be further divided into top-light illumination (TL-) and bottom-light illumination (BL-), as shown in Fig. 2. It should be stated that whether for TL- or BL-geometries, the gate dielectric layer used in these structures, such as TL-TGBC, TL-TGTC, BL-BGTC and BL-BGBC should be transparent enough in order to guarantee the light efficiently arriving on the active organic semiconductor layer for high device performance.

2.2 Photoelectrical characteristics of OPTs
Similar to OFET measurement, transfer and output curves measured under dark and light illumination are two typical characteristics of OPTs, as shown in Fig. 3a and 3b (a PPT constructed based on a donor–acceptor copolymer of HXS-1, detailed molecular structure is shown in Scheme 1).17 Under light illumination, an obvious increase of source–drain current compared to that in dark conditions is observed in the corresponding transfer and output curves due to the contribution of photocurrent. Moreover, in OPTs, the incident light can be used as an independent variation to tune the transistor operation, like the function of gate bias in OFETs, working as a typical light and electric bi-functional device (as shown in Fig. 3b).

Ref. 19, Copyright 2004, American Institute of Physics.

2.3 Working principles of OPTs
There are generally two typical operation modes in OPTs reflected by the relationship of photocurrent (Iph) and incident optical power (Popt): photovoltaic mode and photoconductive mode,18 which will be discussed in detail below.

Photovoltaic mode. 
When the photovoltaic effect is dominant in OPTs, the shift of threshold voltage (Vth) is towards more positive (negative) values for p-channel (n-channel) devices when under light irradiation. The photo-generated excitons in the semiconductor dissociate into free charge carriers (electrons and holes) under extra illumination. These photo-generated electrons and holes accumulate under drain and source electrodes, respectively. As a result, the large number of trapped photo-generated electrons effectively lowers the potential injection barrier between the source electrode and organic semiconductor surface. Moreover, contact resistance is significantly decreased under the effect of light irradiation. Thereby, the lowered injection barrier and contact resistance result in a positive shift of threshold voltage (Vth) and a significant increase in the drain current (Id). The photocurrent caused by photovoltaic effect is shown in Fig. 3c,19 which can be derived according to the following eqn (1):20 Iph,pv = GMΔVth = AkT[ln(1 + ηqλPopt/Ipdhc)]/q(1)where η is the photo-generation quantum efficiency, Popt is the incident optical power, Ipd is the dark current for minority charges, hc/λ is the photon energy, GM is the transconductance, ΔVth is the threshold voltage shift, and A is a proportionality parameter.


Photoconductive mode. 
When the transistor operates in the depletion region (Vg > Vth), photo-generated Id shows a linear increase with optical power, also called photoconductive effect. It is similar to the two-terminal devices without the effect of gate voltage. The transverse electric field induced by the extra gate voltage will contribute to the enhancement of photo-generated carriers. Typical characteristics of photocurrent as a function of the incident optical power under photoconductive effects is shown in Fig. 3d.19 The current can be calculated according to eqn (2): Iph,pc = (qμpE)WD = BPopt(2)where μp is the charge carrier mobility, p is the charge carrier concentration, E is the electric field in the conducting channel, and W is the gate width, D is the depth of absorption region, and B is a proportionality factor.

2.4 Performance parameters of OPTs
Except for the basic characteristic parameters of OFETs, such as charge carrier mobility (μ), threshold voltage (Vth) and on/off ratio, photoresponsivity (R) and photosensitivity (that is photocurrent on/off ratio) (P) are other two basic parameters for evaluating the phototransistor performance. The R and P values can be calculated through the following eqn (3) and (4) based on their corresponding transfer curves: R = (IDS,i − IDS,d)/(SPi)(3) P = (IDS,i − IDS,d)/IDS,d(4)where IDS,d and IDS,i are the drain current in the dark and under illumination, respectively. S is the effective area of devices and Pi is the power of incident optical in unit area.
3 Recent advances in PPTs
The first PPT in the literature was demonstrated by Narayan's group in 2001, which was constructed based on a BL-BGTC geometry with poly(3-octylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3OT) as the active layer and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as the transparent gate dielectric layer.21 This P3OT-based PPT demonstrated a R value of 1 A W−1, which was higher than that of its corresponding planar two-terminal photo detectors, however, it was still obviously lower than that of inorganic phototransistors and SOPTs,10,18 probably due to the slow relaxation process in the polythiophene layer.22 So, in the following, how to further improve the device performance of PPTs has been the research focus in this field. With the development of polymer semiconductors4 and device fabrication techniques of OFETs,5 significant improvement has also been achieved for PPTs. A timeline of literature publication numbers and device performance of PPTs as a function of years are simply depicted in Fig. 4. Obviously, over the past 14 years, the PPT device performance, with P and R as parameter references has undergone remarkable increase with the highest P and R value of PPTs approaching 108 (ref. 49) and ∼1 × 106 (ref. 49) A W−1, respectively.

The basic requirements for polymer semiconductors used in PPTs are high carrier mobility and wide absorption, in order to facilitate the whole process of effective light absorption, exciton dissociation and charge carrier transport like that in polymer solar cells.23Scheme 1 shows the chemical structures of typical polymer semiconductors recently used in PPTs. It can be seen that the polymer material systems are becoming more and more rich, including not only the classical semiconducting polymers, such as P3HT, P3OT, TA-PPE, etc., but also the recently investigated field-effect donor–acceptor (D–A) copolymers. Besides polymer semiconductor themselves, device fabrication techniques and device structures are also crucial for the resulting device performance. In the following, we will give more detailed discussions for the development strategies of high performance PPTs according to the types of active layers used.
3.1 PPTs based on single component film of polymer semiconductors
PPTs based on a single component film of polymer semiconductors, refer to those devices where the active layer is composed of only one kind of polymer semiconductors, which is also the simplest device structure. The first reported PPT was constructed based on such a device structure, where a spin-coated 100 nm P3OT film was used as the active layer.21 This device demonstrated a P value of ∼100 under 532 nm light illumination at 1 mW cm−2, which was further increased to ∼103 for devices based on a thicker P3OT film (150 nm). Subsequently, PPTs based on P3HT or other P3AT single component films were further constructed by the same group. Unexpectedly, polythiophene-based PPTs usually exhibited a slow relaxation of photo-induced excess charge carriers, resulting in a slow decay rate upon switching off the photoexcitation.22 One explanation is because the photo-induced charge carrier generation depends on the VGS, light intensity and temperature, while the transport characteristics are controlled by the carrier mobility and factors influencing the local built-in electric field parameters.24 Such a concept of slow relaxation of excess charges in OFETs was further used for the construction of memory devices by Dutta et al., where the memory states were controlled by the VGS applied on the OFETs, realizing the write, store and erase processes (Fig. 5a).25 Subsequently, Wasapinyokul et al. fabricated PPTs based on a single component of PQT-12 film and systematically investigated the effect of incident light intensity on the device optoelectronic properties.26 Under light illumination with a fixed wavelength but various intensities from dark to 1100 μW cm−2, the authors found that for PQT-12-based PPTs, the source–drain current demonstrated relatively weak dependence on the light illumination intensity. The current first increased with the increase of light intensity but then decreased after a threshold value at a high light intensity, due to the oversaturation behavior of electron–hole recombination under light illumination with high power.

Poly(para-phenylene ethynylene)s (PPEs) are another typical polymer semiconductors investigated in PPTs, which usually used as molecular wires in nano/molecular devices due to their ideal rigid-rod conjugated structure and conductivity, and are usually used as molecular wires in nano/molecular devices.27–29 In 2004, Xu et al. constructed PPTs based on a single component film of a cross-conjugated polymer, 2,5-bis(dibutylaminostyryl)-1,4-phenylene-b-alkyne-b-1,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzeneterpolymer (BAS-PPE) with a BL-BGBC geometry.30 Typical photoelectrical characteristics were observed for BAS-PPE based PPTs, giving a high P value of 6 × 103 and a R value of 5 mA W−1. Following this, Nakashima et al. had synthesized another novel rigid-rod PPE derivative with thioacetyl end-functionalized groups (TA-PPE).31 Hu et al. first fabricated polymer nanoscale photoswitches and phototransistors based on the self-assembled TA-PPE molecules and planar nanogap electrodes. With light illumination switching on and off, these devices exhibited typical on and off states, with a fast switching rate of 400 Hz and high P ratio of ∼103 under the effect of tunnelling current.32 Dong et al. further fabricated PPTs based on TA-PPE films with a TL-BGTC device structure, as expected which also demonstrated high device performance with a P ratio of 3.3 × 103, and a R value of 36 mA W−1 at VGS = 0 V.33,34 Moreover, the optoelectronic properties of polymer thin films are significantly affected by the molecular orientation in the solid state, and the higher orders of polymer chains are, the higher the device performance is.34 Additionally, different from P3AT-based devices,22,24 PPE-based phototransistors and photoswitches both exhibit relatively fast on and off switching rates under the effect of on and off light illumination.34,35 Two effects, photoconductive and photovoltaic effects, were both characterized in the same transistor, depending on the gate bias. With gate bias, the polymer phototransistors were dominated by photovoltaic effect, while without gate bias, they were dominated by photoconductive effect.
Recently, D–A copolymers have also been applied into PPTs due to their attractive advantages of high charge carrier mobility and broad absorption region.23,36 Poly-9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-bithiophene (F8T2) is the first copolymer used in PPTs. Hamilton et al. systematically studied the photoelectrical properties of F8T2-PPTs based on a BL-BGBC structure,37 which demonstrated a significant increase of current in the off-state, while a small change in the on-state under light illumination, attributed to different photoelectric effects. A R value of 0.7 mA W−1 in the strong accumulation region and a P value of ∼103 in the off-state were obtained for F8T2-PPTs. Further, the authors examined the effect of light wavelength on the device performance of F8T2-based PPTs. It was found that high photo-energy photons produced by short wavelengths were easier to be absorbed by the polymers, thus giving high density of charges in the active layer and high device performance of PPTs.38 Later, a higher R value of 18.5 A W−1 was further obtained for F8T2-PPTs by Wang et al.39 Inspired by previous studies, more recently, a variety of narrow-band gap D–A copolymers have been used as the active layer in PPTs. For example, the large planar benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit is an attractive building block for designing novel D–A conjugated polymers. In 2009, Qin et al. designed and synthesized a novel BDT-based copolymer (HXS-1), which demonstrated very high photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 5%, due to its close molecular packing in the solid state and a wide range of visible absorption.40 Subsequently, Dong et al. fabricated PPTs based on the thin films of HXS-1 polymer and obtained a high charge carrier mobility of 0.06 cm2 V−1 s−1, on/off ratio of over 107 as well as high photoelectric properties with a P value of ∼4.6 × 104, which was also the highest P value in its reported time.17 Huang et al. fabricated PPTs based on another BDT-based copolymer, poly{4,8-bis(2′-ethylhexylthiophene)benzo[1,2-b;3,4-b′]difuran-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-5′,6′-dioctyloxy-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)} (PBDFTDTBT), and achieved a P value of 1.2 × 105 and R value of 360 mA W−1 under white light illumination.41 Li et al. constructed PPTs based on the self-assembled ultrathin crystalline copolymer films of PQBOC8 copolymer,42 which showed a R value of 970 A W−1, and a P value of 1.36 × 104 under a very low white light irradiation (43 mW cm−2). Another BDT-based copolymer, PBDT-BBT of 4,8-bis(2-thienyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and 5,5′-bibenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazo with a wide absorption of 300–800 nm has recently also been used in PPTs, which demonstrated a R value of 3200 mA W−1 and a P value of 4 × 105.43 Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based semiconductors are another type of promising building block for copolymer materials, due to their easily tuned structures, solubility and high crystallinity in the solid state.44 In 2013, Yang et al. designed and synthesized two DPP-based copolymers, P(DTDPP-alt-(1,6)PY) and P(DTDPP-alt-(2,7)PY) (with the different anchoring positions in the pyrene).45 These two polymers exhibit not only good charge transport performance with a carrier mobility of 0.23 cm2 V−1 s−1 but also high photoelectrical properties with a high P value of 1.2 × 105 and R value of 360 mA W−1 in PPTs. Recently, Zhan et al. designed and synthesized a DPP-based copolymer, P(DPP4T-co-BDT) by the polymerization of 3,6-bis(5′-bromo-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)-2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)pyrrolo-[3,4-c]-pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione and 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-dimethoxybenzo[1,2-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene.46 The copolymer P(DPP4T-co-BDT)-based thin film PPTs showed excellent photo-response properties with R up to 4 × 103 A W−1 (the highest value to date) and P up to 6.8 × 105 under low intensity light illumination, which was much higher than that of inorganic single crystal silicon phototransistors. Nam and co-workers demonstrated OPTs based on a novel dense and conformal surface PDA thin film, which was produced using self-polymerization of a homogeneous PDA solution under oxygen bubbling instead of a conventional air stream.47 Device measurement results showed that the PDA thin film device performance could be tailored by adjusting the incident light intensity and gate voltage (with the highest R value of 9 A W−1 at VG = 12 V and P value of 6.9 × 104 at VG = −2 V) and a prompt reproducible photo-switching property was obtained for this novel PDA-based OPTs with a fast response rate (rise and decay time: ∼0.5 s and 1.2 s, respectively). Li et al. fabricated PPTs based on an ambipolar D–A copolymer (PPhTQ), and achieved a maximum photo-responsivity of 400 A W−1 and a balanced hole (0.09 cm2 V−1 s−1) and electron (0.06 cm2 V−1 s−1) charge transport mobility.48 Except for the development of polymeric materials, the advances of device fabrication techniques, such as adopting a short-channel geometry in devices, also could enable high performance of PPTs. More recently, Wang et al. successfully constructed an ultrasensitive and high performance PPT based on a short-channel device geometry with a BGTC structure and diketopyrrolopyrrole-thiazolothiazole copolymer (PDPPTzBT) as the active layer.49 A series of short conducting channel arrays were constructed through a simple and effective ‘coffee ring lithography’ inkjet printing technique via a 50 μm orifice nozzle, giving the channel lengths from several micrometers down to 700 nm (Fig. 5b-i). A high carrier mobility of 1.2 cm2 V−1 s−1, and photo-responsivity with an extremely high R of 106 A W−1 were obtained for PDPPTzBT-based PPTs with 700 nm channel length. Moreover, it was found that the onset gate voltage (ΔVon) was strongly dependent on the channel length, that is, the reduction of channel lengths was accompanied by an increasing trend of ΔVon, due to modulation of the gate voltage (Fig. 5b-i). A gigantic shift of onset voltage (Von) was observed in the sub-micron channel transistors, which was amounting to 90 V under the illumination of 40 μW cm−2. Additionally, PDPPTzBT-based PPTs demonstrated relatively long recovery time and exhibited a unique characteristic of persistent photoconductivity with a stable intermediate current state after switching off the light illumination. Such characteristic combining its gate controllable property enables these devices to function as reproducible light-triggered memory devices (Fig. 5b-ii), where by applying appropriate light illumination and pulse gate voltage, the writing process, different memory states and erase process could be realized in a single device.
3.2 PPTs based on blend films of polymer semiconductors
The combination of bulk hetero-junction effect, where donor and acceptor materials are combined together in the active layer, are widely used in organic photovoltaic devices, due to the ultrafast long-range charge separation at the donor–acceptor interface.50 Such a concept has also been used in PPTs. Anthopoulos et al.51 reported light-sensing PPTs based on donor and acceptor blend films of 6,6′-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and poly-2-methoxy-5-3,7-dimethyloctyloxy-p-phenylene vinylene (OC1C10PPV), which demonstrated not only ambipolar charge transport characteristics but also much faster response time than unipolar OPT devices. Interestingly, by carefully tuning the ambipolar transport properties, their photo-responsivity can be further controlled and improved. The fast response and controlled photo-responsivity properties of blend film based PPTs demonstrated their potential applications in electro-optical switches and logic circuits (Fig. 6). Yasin et al. further fabricated organic bulk-hetero-junctions based on blend films of P3HT and PCBM and obtained a R value of 3 A W−1 at VDS = −8 V.52 In addition, except for polymer/small molecule blends, polymer/inorganic nanoparticles are also used as the blends in PPTs. In 2008, Mok et al. successfully introduced photo-sensitive composite films of P3HT and TiO2 nanoparticles in PPTs.53 These devices based on P3HT:TiO2 active blend films demonstrated a rapid change in channel current under illumination due to the electrons trapped by TiO2 nanoparticles. Based on this result, they further deeply investigated the photo-responsive characteristics of P3HT:TiO2-based devices, and found that their photo-response properties was extremely sensitive to weak light due to an integration effect.54 Moreover, the photo induced mechanism was investigated it was found that photons were first absorbed by P3HT and then the excitons effectively separated into free charge at the P3HT:TiO2 surface under UV light illumination while the excitons generated in the P3HT part and electron were trapped in the TiO2 nanoparticles under visible light. So, excitons could be generated in the P3HT and TiO2 nanoparticles, respectively. Therefore, both the visible and UV light illumination could result in electrons accumulating in TiO2 nanoparticles, thus caused the high photosensitivity of the devices. The concept of using polymer/inorganic nanoparticles in PPT suggests potential applications in wavelength sensors by selecting different semiconducting polymers and inorganic nanoparticles.

3.3 PPTs based on micro/nano-crystals of polymer semiconductors
As is well known, the performance of devices is highly sensitive to solid state crystallinity, crystal grain size and molecular packing of organic semiconductors. However, the inevitable large amounts of defects and grain boundaries in thin films have a negative impact in improvement of device performance.55 Thus, obtaining highly ordered microstructures is an effective approach to further realize the enhancement of device performance, and beneficial for the integration of micro/nano-optoelectronic devices and circuits. In 2010, Pal et al. reported PPTs based on regular P3HT fibers, which were prepared through a high-boiling point solvent of p-xylene.56 The high crystallinity of P3HT nanowires contributed to the high photoelectrical properties of its PPTs with a R value of 250 A W−1 and P value of 3.8 × 103. Dierckx et al. also fabricated PPTs based on the P3HT fibers and obtained a much higher P value of 6.8 × 103 due to the further improvement of its crystallinity by optimizing the self-assembly process.57 Liu et al. prepared large-area nanowire arrays of poly{(9,9-dihexy-L-fluorene-2,7-diyl)-alt-[4,7-bis(3-dodecylthiophen-5-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-2,2′-diyl]} (PFTBT) through traditional anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) template methods by elaborately tuning and controlling the self-assembly of molecules into the AAO pores. PPTs based on PFTBT nanowires exhibited a R value of as high as 1700 mA W−1 and switch P ratio of 2000.58 Obviously, incorporating polymer microstructures in PPTs is a good way to improve the device performance because of the reduced defects compared to thin films, however, the crystallinity of these previously reported polymer nanostructures is still not high enough, or even some of them are still in the amorphous state.59 Therefore, how to prepare high crystalline polymer micro/nanostructures is crucial not only for construction of high polymer optoelectronic devices but also establishing an accurate platform for repeated probing charge transport and photoelectrical properties of polymer semiconductors.
Since the 2000s, small-molecule organic single crystals have been widely investigated and remarkable progress has been achieved in this field, including the growth of high quality organic single crystals, the development of feasible fabrication techniques and the construction of high performance devices, which indeed greatly contributed to the development of organic electronics.60–62 However, how about are crystalline or single crystals of polymer micro/nanostructures? Actually, it has been a challenging task in polymer science to grow large-size and high-quality polymer crystals, especially of the electron-rich conjugated polymers. In 2006, Kim et al. first reported the single crystal microwires of P3HT polymer, which were prepared through a self-seeding method from a dilute chloroform solution.63 The authors found that in the P3HT microcrystals, P3HT were arranged with their π–π stacking direction along the long axis of microwires. In 2009, Dong et al. reported single crystal micro/nanowires of TA-PPE through a modified solvent assisted self-assembly method,64 where a different polymer molecular packing from that of P3HT microwires was observed, i.e., the conjugated polymer backbones of TA-PPE were aligned along the long axis of nanowires.63 The obtainment of high-quality crystals of P3HT and TA-PPE opens up a new area for the investigation of other conjugated polymer crystals as well as the corresponding optoelectronic devices. To date, various conjugated polymers have been proved to form crystal microstructures, leading to the significant improvement of charge transport compared to their corresponding thin films,65 and the highest mobility value for conjugated polymer crystals obtained recently was up to 24.0 cm2 V−1 s−1.66 In 2013, Liu et al. first reported PPTs based on crystal microwires of bithiazole-thiazolothiazole copolymer (PTz),67 which were prepared through the solvent assisted self-assembly method similar to that of TA-PPE nanowires.64 PPTs based on PTz nanowires exhibited high device performance with hole mobility of 0.46 cm2 V−1 s−1 and R of 2531 A W−1 and P of 1.7 × 104 due to its close π-stacking and unique molecular packing with the conjugated backbones aligned to the long axis of nanowires (Fig. 7). More recently, Um et al.66 fabricated PPTs based on single crystals of another D–A conjugated polymer, 1,2-bis(5-(thiophen-2-yl)selenophen-2-yl)ethene (DPPBTSPE), which also showed high device performance with a R of 1920 A W−1 and P value of 104. Much higher device performance is expected for conjugated polymer crystals and more deep investigations are still needed in this field. Table 1 summarizes the device performance of PPTs discussed in the article.

4 Flexible organic phototransistors (FOPTs)
The attractive advantages of light weight, low cost, easy solution processing of SOPTs and PPTs have recently advanced the exploration of their flexible and stretchable devices and circuits. For instance, Chou et al.68 presented flexible in-cell devices by incorporating a phototransistor and a photoswitch together based on a transparent polyethersulfone (PES) substrate with a cross-linked poly(4-vinylphenol) as the polymer dielectric layer and N,N′-ditridecyl-3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI-C13H27) as the active layer. This flexible optoelectronic circuit demonstrated a low operation voltage (3.0 V) and high opto-electrical properties with a R value of 0.41 A W−1, indicating its potential application in in-cell touch screens (Fig. 8a–c). Kim et al. demonstrated another successful flexible polymer phototransistor based on a transparent and colourless polyimide plastic substrate through an all-solution process, such as roll-to-plate reverse offset printing (ROP), inkjet printing and bar coating (Fig. 8d–e).69 High crystallinity in the active layer poly[2,5-bis(2-octyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4(2H,5H)-dione-(E)-1,2-di(2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)ethene] (PDPP-DBTE) was obtained by optimizing the processing conditions, such as high-temperature thermal treatment at 180 °C, which contributed to the resulting excellent electrical switching properties with a fast response time of 11.2 s and high photosensitivity with photo-to-dark ratio property of 1.54 × 105 in off-state (VGS = 11 V) (Fig. 8f). These results provide us hope and confidence for the realization of large-area flexible optoelectronic applications of OPTs.

5 Perspective and conclusion
In this review, we have systematically summarized the development of polymer phototransistors over the past few years in the development of polymer semiconductors and device physics. Despite the tremendous progress demonstrated for polymer phototransistors, there are still large areas to further improve the device performance, such as by further (1) enriching the polymer material systems in PPTs, especially by incorporating the recently reported high-mobility, narrow-band D–A copolymers; (2) improving the crystallinity of polymer chains in the solid state with appropriate molecular packing; (3) optimizing device structures from the aspects of interface contact and channel sizes; (4) using theoretical calculations to guide the experimental studies. Opportunities and challenges coexist and we believe that under the joint efforts of materials scientists, physical scientists and theoretical scientists, significant progress could be further achieved for polymer phototransistors to advance their practical applications, especially in integrated flexible optoelectronic devices/circuits.
