In comparison with the model compound M-TP, which adopts phenylene as the π-spacer, the tailor-made dyes display enhanced spectral responses in the red portion of the solar spectrum. Through the introduction of two hexyloxy chains on the diphenylthienylamine donor, the DSSC employing dye OHexDPTP exhibited high power conversion efficiency up to 7.64% under AM1.5G irradiation.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable interest since Grätzel's pioneering report in 1991.1 Photosensitizers certainly play a crucial role for highly efficient DSSCs and have been extensively investigated. In addition to RuII polypyridyl-based sensitizers,2 metal-free organic dyes have also been utilized in DSSCs because of the flexibility in tailoring their molecular structures, low cost, and high molar extinction coefficients.3 Remarkably, organic-based DSSCs with conversion efficiencies comparable to the Ru-based DSSCs have been reported recently.4 Due to the effective photoinduced intramolecular charge transfer characteristics, most of the efficient organic sensitizers are modeled on the donor–(π-spacer)–acceptor (D–π–A) system. For efficient solar energy conversion, it is desirable to use dyes that possess increased molar extinction coefficients that extend throughout the visible and into the near-IR regions. Organic sensitizers with long π-conjugated spacers had been shown to be operative in augmenting the molar extinction coefficients as well as in realizing panchromatic light-harvesting, giving moderate DSSC efficiency and stability.4,5 In addition to the length of the π-conjugated spacer, the intrinsic electronic characteristics of the π-conjugated spacer may also affect the spectral response of the dyes. In most organic D–π–A dyes, the π-conjugated spacers linked to the acceptor (cyanoacrylic acid) are typically electron-rich systems, such as thiophene derivatives,6 furan,7 selenophene,8 and pyrrole.9 However, such designs only yield limited bathochromic shifts in absorption. Meanwhile, a few organic D–π–A dyes incorporating electron-withdrawing terephthalonitrile10 or electron-deficient heteroarenes such as quinoline,11 isoxazole,12 and thiazole13 moieties as linkages to cyanoacrylic acid, showed more red-shifted absorption than their parent analogues and thus enhanced the light harvesting.
Here we report a series of organic D–π–A dyes, in which various diphenylthienylamines donors and cyanoacrylic acid acceptors are bridged by an electron-deficient pyrimidine ring. A model compound M-TP with phenylene as the π-spacer was also synthesized for parallel comparison. In general, the dyes were designed with the following three structural characteristics: (i) the pyrimidine-containing π-system which favors planar geometry necessary for effective intramolecular charge transfer;14 (ii) the acceptor and also the TiO2-anchoring group, cyanoacrylic acid, is linked to a highly electron-deficient pyrimidine ring; (iii) the diphenylthienylamine moiety is adopted as a stronger electron donor compared to the conventional triphenylamine moieties.15 These three characteristics are all beneficial in lowering the energy of the intramolecular charge transfer transition. As a result, these dyes show evident bathochromic shifts in absorption, and thus effectively improve the light-harvesting range. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the pyrimidine ring has been used as the π-conjugated spacer in organic photosensitizers for DSSCs.
Results and discussion
The synthetic pathways of new dyes DPTP, OMeDPTP, OHexDPTP, and model compound M-TP are illustrated in Scheme 1, and the detailed syntheses are described in the Experimental. Palladium-catalyzed Negishi coupling reactions of 1 with 5-bromo-2-iodopyrimidine afforded 2, which were then converted to their corresponding carbaldehydes 3 by lithiation with n-butyl lithium and subsequently quenched with ethyl formate. Finally, the aldehydes were condensed with cyanoacetic acid to yield the target compounds DPTP, OMeDPTP, and OHexDPTPvia the Knöevenagel reaction in the presence of ammonium acetate. The model compound M-TP was obtained via two-step processes that first involved the Stille coupling reaction of 5-(N,N-diphenylamino)-2-(tri-n-butylstannyl)thiophene with 4-bromobenzaldehyde, followed by the Knöevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid.

The UV-Vis absorption spectra and emission spectra of dyes in a tert-butanol–acetonitrile (1:1) solution are depicted in Fig. 1. Their photophysical data are also summarized in Table 1. The absorption spectrum of DPTP in solution shows an absorption maximum (λmax) centered at 484 nm (ε = 25300 M−1 cm−1), which is assigned to the π–π* transition of the D–π–A conjugated system. The M-TP that incorporates phenylene as the π-spacer displays a weaker and blue-shifted absorption band at 438 nm (ε = 19800 M−1 cm−1) in comparison with DPTP. It appears that our molecular scaffold effectively shifts the absorption peak to a longer wavelength. Furthermore, OMeDPTP and OHexDPTP exhibit a λmax at 502 (ε = 31300 M−1 cm−1), and 506 nm (ε = 29300 M−1 cm−1), respectively, which are red-shifted by ca. 20 nm compared to that of the parent dye DPTP, as a result of the stronger electron-donating nature of the dialkoxy substituents. DPTP, OMeDPTP, and OHexDPTP exhibit emission bands centered at 560, 590, and 594 nm, respectively, when excited on their absorption maxima.

Upon anchoring on the 7 μm porous TiO2 nanoparticle films, the absorption of these dyes blue-shifted in comparison with those in the tert-butanol–acetonitrile (1:1) solution (Fig. 2). The blue shift may stem from the deprotonation of carboxylic acid upon adsorption onto the TiO2 surface and the resulting carboxylate–TiO2 unit is a weaker electron acceptor compared to the carboxylic acid.6g Similarly to many metal-free dyes,6g,7,13,17 the absorption of the dyes exhibit negative solvatochromism, i.e. a blue shift of λmax in polar solvents (see Fig. 3, taking DPTP as an example). This phenomenon may be attributed to the interaction of polar solvent molecules with the carboxylic acid, which decreases the electron-withdrawing strength of the COOH group.

Density function theory (DFT) calculations show a coplanar conformation between thiophene and pyrimidine due to the lack of ortho–ortho steric interactions, and the HOMOs of both sensitizers are mainly populated on diphenylamine and thiophene moieties, whereas LUMOs are sizably delocalized through pyrimidine and cyanoacrylic acid fragments (Fig. 4). This result suggests that the HOMO–LUMO excitation would shift the electron density distribution from the diphenylamine unit to the cyanoacrylic acid moiety, facilitating efficient photoinduced/interfacial electron injection from excited dyes to the TiO2 electrode.

Quasi-reversible oxidation waves (Eox in Table 1) of the dyes were observed in the cyclic voltammetry (CV), which can be attributed to the oxidation of the diphenylthienylamine moieties. The lower oxidation potential of OMeDPTP and OHexDPTPvs.DPTP can be ascribed to the presence of stronger electron-donating dialkoxy substituents. The zero–zero excitation energy (E0–0), which was estimated from the onset point of the absorption spectra, and the ground-state oxidation potential (Eox) were used to calculate the excited-state oxidation potential Eox* (= Eox − E0–0). It is worth mentioning that both ground-state and excited-state oxidation potentials of DPTP are more positive than those of M-TP, yet the difference in the excited-state oxidation potentials of the two dyes is larger than that in ground-state oxidation potentials. It clearly suggests that the introduction of the electron-deficient pyrimidine as the π-spacer has a significant influence on the excited-state potential but a more limited effect on the ground-state oxidation potential of DPTP. The different influence on the ground-state and excited-state oxidation potentials by incorporating pyrimidine leads to a narrow energy gap of DPTP. The deduced Eox* values of these dyes are more negative than the conduction band edge of the TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE),18 indicating that the electron injection process shall be energetically favorable. In addition, the ground-state oxidation potentials of the dyes are more positive than the redox potential of the iodide/triiodide couple (0.4 V vs. NHE), suggesting that the oxidized dyes shall be able to accept electrons from I− thermodynamically for effective dye regeneration and minimize the charge recombination between oxidized dyes and photoinjected electrons in TiO2.
The photovoltaic characteristics of these dyes as the sensitizers for DSSCs were evaluated with a sandwich DSSC cell using 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.05 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate in a mixture of acetonitrile–valeronitrile (85:15, v/v) as the redox electrolyte (details of the device preparation and characterization are described in the experimental). The incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and the current–voltage (J–V) curves under standard global AM 1.5 solar irradiation of the DSSCs are plotted in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, respectively. The DSSCs using DPTP, OMeDPTP, and OHexDPTP show IPCEs > 70% from 380–400 nm to 570 nm and IPCE maxima of 90–92% around 450 nm, indicating highly efficient DSSC performances. In agreement with the trend in absorption spectra, the IPCE spectra of DPTP, OMeDPTP and OHexDPTP all exhibit higher peak values and extend to longer wavelengths than that of the model compound M-TP. Moreover, with dialkoxy substituents, IPCE spectra of OMeDPTP and OHexDPTP extend to longer wavelengths than that of DPTP. As listed in Table 2, the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF) of the OHexDPTP cell are 13.79 mA cm−2, 0.77 V, and 0.72, respectively, yielding an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 7.64%. Although both DPTP and OMeDPTP cells possess Jsc similar to (or even slightly higher than) that of the OHexDPTP cell, yet with relatively lower Voc, they both exhibit inferior η values of 6.72% and 7.05%, respectively. For a fair comparison, the N719-sensitized DSSC was also fabricated and tested under similar conditions (Table 2). The efficiency of the OHexDPTP cell reaches ∼90% of the N719 cell efficiency.

Interestingly, DPTP and OHexDPTP show nearly the same Jsc despite the larger molar extinction coefficient and more red-shifted absorption of OHexDPTP. This is likely to be due to the smaller density of OHexDPTP adsorbed on the TiO2 surface with greater steric congestion of the dihexyloxy-substituted diphenylthienylamine moiety at the donor. By desorbing the dyes adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface with basic solution, the adsorbing densities were determined to be 1.8 × 10−7 and 6.0 × 10−8 mol cm−2 for DPTP and OHexDPTP, respectively, supporting such a mechanism. On the other hand, the surface density of OMeDPTP is similar to that of DPTP due to their similar molecular sizes, and thus the largest Jsc of OMeDPTP among the dyes can be ascribed to its simultaneously better light-harvesting ability and larger surface density on TiO2.
Through the introduction of two long aliphatic hexyloxy chains on the diphenylthienylamine donor, one also notes that the OHexDPTP-based cell gives an enhanced Voc in contrast to the DPTP- and OMeDPTP-based cells. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted to elucidate these phenomena. In this study, the impedance spectroscopy was carried out by subjecting the cell to the constant AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination and to the bias at the open-circuit voltage Voc of the cell (namely, under the condition of no dc electric current), for better manifesting the process at the TiO2/electrolyte interface of a cell under operation.19Fig. 7a shows the EIS Nyquist plots (i.e. minus imaginary part of the impedance −Z′′ vs. the real part of the impedance Z′ when sweeping the frequency) for DSSCs based on DPTP, OMeDPTP and OHexDPTP dyes. For the frequency range investigated (20 Hz to 1 MHz), in all cells, a larger semicircle occurs in the lower frequency range (∼20 Hz to 1 kHz) and a smaller semicircle occurs in the higher frequency range. With the bias illumination and voltage applied, the larger semicircle at lower frequencies corresponds to the charge transfer processes at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, while the smaller semicircle at higher frequencies corresponds to the charge transfer processes at the Pt/electrolyte interface. The three cells hardly show any difference in smaller semicircles at higher frequencies, but the difference in larger semicircles at lower frequencies between the OHexDPTP and DPTP (or OMeDPTP) cells is significant. The larger width of the lower-frequency semicircle of the OHexDPTP cell indicates a larger charge-transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.

Fig. 7b shows the EIS Bode plots (i.e. the phase of the impedance vs. the frequency) of the DSSCs based on DPTP, OMeDPTP, and OHexDPTP dyes. For the frequency range investigated, both EIS Bode plots also exhibit two peak features; the one at higher frequencies corresponds to the charge transfer at the Pt/electrolyte interface, and the one at lower frequencies corresponds to the charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. Again, the difference in Bode plots of the three cells mainly occurs in the lower-frequency range. The characteristic frequency of the lower-frequency peak in the Bode plot is related to the charge recombination rate, and its reciprocal is associated with the electron lifetime.20 As can be seen in Fig. 7b, the lower-frequency peak of the OHexDPTP cell shifts to a significantly lower frequency (compared to the DPTP and OMeDPTP cells), indicating that the electron lifetime was effectively prolonged by the two longer hexyloxy chains near the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. EIS results clearly suggest that the two longer hexyloxy chains of OHexDPTP act as effective blocking units between the TiO2 surface and the electrolyte, preventing hydrophilic I3− ions approaching the TiO2 surface and thereby leading to suppressed charge recombination/dark current and lengthened electron lifetimes.21 These factors may in turn lead to the higher Voc of the OHexDPTP cell than those of the DPTP and OMeDPTP cells.
Conclusions
In summary, a series of new push–pull (D–π–A) DSSC sensitizers have been synthesized and characterized, in which different diphenylthienylamines bearing various terminal substituents were chosen as donor (D) that were bridged by electron-deficient pyrimidine rings to the acceptor (A), cyanoacrylic acid. By taking advantage of the characteristic planarity and electronic deficiency of pyrimidine, the new dyes efficiently yield the bathochromic shift in absorption and effectively improve the light-harvesting. The introduction of two long hexyloxy chains on the diphenylthienylamine donor appears to suppress charge recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, leading to a higher open-circuit voltage of the solar cell. A solar cell device based on the sensitizer OHexDPTP yielded an overall conversion efficiency of 7.64% under AM1.5G irradiation. This new molecular design strategy could trigger the future development of other simple organic photosensitizers for efficient DSSCs.

To a stirring solution of 1a (5.03 g, 20 mmol) in anhydrous THF (60 mL) was added dropwise to n-BuLi (1.6 M, 13.13 mL, 21 mmol) at −78 °C under an argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture was warmed to −35 °C and stirred for 15 min. ZnCl2 (22 mL of a 1 M solution in THF, 22 mmol) was then added to the reaction mixture in one portion, then the reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 30 min.

To a stirring solution of 2a (4.90 g, 12 mmol) in 160 mL anhydrous THF was added dropwise to n-BuLi (1.6 M, 7.73 mL, 12.36 mmol) at −100 °C under an argon atmosphere. The resulting solution was stirred for 20 min, after which dry ethyl formate (1.03 mL, 12.72 mmol) was added dropwise over 5 min. After stirring for 20 min, the reaction was quenched with 1.5 M HCl in THF solution (8 mL, 12 mmol). The cold bath was removed, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h. The THF was removed under reduced pressure and the reaction mixture was extracted with chloroform, the combined extracts were washed with brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered.

Solvent effect measurement
The absorption spectra of the two dyes were measured in different organic solvents while maintaining the concentrations of the dye solutions below 1 × 10−5 M.
Theoretical calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were evaluated by the B3LYP hybrid functional for the geometry optimizations. All the molecular orbital levels of HOMO and LUMO were achieved with the 6–31G(d) basis set implemented in the Gaussian 03 package.
Measurement of absorption spectra of dye-loaded nanoporous TiO2 films
A 7 μm thick transparent porous TiO2 nanoparticle layer (adopting 20 nm anatase TiO2 nanoparticles) was coated on a glass plate by the doctor-blade method. After sintering at 500 °C for 30 min, the TiO2 film was immersed into dye solutions of 0.5 mM dye in chlorobenzene at room temperature for 24 h. Then the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the dye-loaded TiO2 film was recorded on a spectrophotometer.
Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells
To prepare the DSSC working electrodes, the FTO glass plates were first cleaned in a detergent solution using an ultrasonic bath for 15 min, and then rinsed with water and ethanol. A layer of 20 nm sized anatase TiO2 nanoparticles for the transparent nanocrystalline layer was first coated onto the FTO glass plates by the doctor-blade method. After drying the film at 120 °C, another layer of 400 nm sized anatase TiO2 nanoparticles was then deposited as the light scattering layer of the DSSC. The resulting working electrode was composed of a 12 μm thick transparent TiO2 nanoparticle layer (particle size: 20 nm) and a 4 μm thick TiO2 scattering layer (particle size: 400 nm). The nanoporous TiO2 electrodes were then sequentially heated at 150 °C for 10 min, 300 °C for 10 min, 400 °C for 10 min, and finally, at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling, the nanoporous TiO2 electrodes were immersed into a chlorobenzene solution containing organic dyes (0.5 mM) or acetonitrile/tert-butanol mixture (1:1) containing N719 (0.5 mM) with deoxycholic acid (0.5 mM, DCA) as a co-adsorbent at room temperature for 24 h. Counter electrodes of the DSSC were prepared by depositing 40 nm thick Pt films onto the FTO glass plates by e-beam evaporation. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 working electrode and a counter electrode were then assembled into a sealed DSSC cell with a sealant spacer between the two electrode plates. A drop of electrolyte solution [0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.05 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate in a mixture of acetonitrile–valeronitrile (85:15, v/v)] was injected into the cell through a drilled hole. Finally, the hole was sealed using the sealant and a cover glass. An anti-reflection film was adhered to the DSSC. A mask with an aperture area of 0.125 cm2 was covered on a testing cell during photocurrent–voltage and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency measurements.
Photocurrent–voltage measurement
The photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs were measured under illumination of AM1.5G solar light from a 300 W xenon lamp solar simulator. The incident light intensity was calibrated as 100 mW cm−2. Photocurrent–voltage curves were obtained by applying an external bias voltage to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent.
Incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency measurement
The incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured by using a 75-W xenon arc lamp as the light source coupled to a monochromator.25 The IPCE data were taken by illuminating monochromatic light on the solar cells (with a wavelength sampling interval of 10 nm from 300 nm to 800 nm) and measuring the short-circuit current of the solar cells. The IPCE measurement was performed with a lock-in amplifier, a low speed chopper, and a bias light source under the full computer control.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the cells was measured by using an impedance analyzer with a frequency range of 20 Hz to 1 MHz. In this study, during the impedance measurement, the cell was under the constant AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination. The impedance of the cell (throughout the frequency range of 20 Hz to 1 MHz) was then measured by applying a bias at the open-circuit voltage Voc of the cell (namely, under the condition of no dc electric current) and by using an ac amplitude of 10 mV.
