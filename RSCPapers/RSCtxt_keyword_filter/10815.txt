    , Accepted 25th March 2019First published on 27th March 2019AbstractIdentifying lateral heterostructures (LHSs) with suitable two-dimensional (2D) building blocks is still an urgent challenge in materials science and device physics. In this work, we propose a new series of novel LHSs based on the ideal members of 2D group-VA derivatives, namely BX1–BX2 (X1, X2 = P, As, Sb) with different connecting edges. Through evaluating their stabilities, electronic properties, and optically related electric behaviors by using first principles calculation methods, a battery of novel and excellent properties are demonstrated including large formation energies, moderate direct band gaps, ultrahigh carrier mobilities, and efficient optical absorptions. Moreover, the electronic devices based on these LHSs show good performance for photoelectric conversion in the visible light region, and more appreciable photocurrents, photon responsivities, external quantum efficiencies, energy conversion efficiencies, and fill factors are explored compared with some other reported 2D materials. We believe the new group of stable and novel BX1–BX2 LHSs can provide a new strategy for experimental design and application of future photovoltaic conversion devices and excitonic solar cells.
1 Introduction
Since the experimental fabrication of graphene in 2004,1 a series of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials have been proposed, including graphene2,3 black phosphorus,4,5 transition-metal dichalcogenides,6,7 and h-BN,8,9 which have been investigated extensively and shown favorable applications in many fields of electronics and spintronics.10–17 Driven by the ideal performances of these 2D materials, some new 2D layered materials have been successively predicted, such as TiNX (X = F, Cl, Br),18 KAgSe,19 and SnX2 (X = S, Sn).20 These novel 2D materials possess ideal direct band gaps and high carrier mobilities, and they are expected to possess good application prospects for photoelectric conversion, solar cells, light-sensitive detectors, and so forth. As well as this, the appearance of various 2D materials provides another method to design a new kind of novel 2D material, namely 2D heterostructures, which consist of different 2D materials aligned together with their electronic and optical properties being synthesized.21,22 Recent investigations into 2D heterostructures have opened up an exciting realm in the modern micro-electronics industry to accommodate the increasing demands for superior devices in electronics, photoelectronics, and photovoltaics,23–25 although enormous challenges have to be faced for researchers to explore the diversity and efficiency of 2D heterostructures.26–28
In view of the different composite patterns, 2D heterostructures can be generally classified into two groups, i.e., the vertical heterostructure (VHS) and the lateral heterostructure (LHS). The former indicates a layer-by-layer configuration synthesized by stacking different 2D materials vertically,29,30 and the later refers to the direct edge-connection between different 2D materials in the same layer. VHSs and LHSs have their own advantages and disadvantages. VHSs have a wider range of material selections and it is relatively easier to fabricate them in experiments, but their stability is difficult to guarantee in light of the uncontrollable orientation, incompatible area, and weak van der Waals interactions between different layers, although some of these shortcomings are being overcome with the rapid development of experimental techniques.31,32 LHSs have stricter requirements and a smaller selection of materials than VHSs, but their much smaller contact area with favorable covalent bonds near the contact edge ensures their epitaxial quality and stability, which is crucial in device fabrication.33–37 In addition, LHSs have lower dimensions than VHSs. The study of 2D heterostructures is still in its infancy, and there is still a large gap in searching for materials and theoretical exploration for designing higher quality 2D heterostructures.
Recently, a new series of 2D group-VA boride BX (X = P, As, and Sb) materials were reported, which show significant direct band gaps and excellent carrier mobilities.38 The highest electron mobility can reach 3.2 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is very close to that of graphene (∼3 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1).39 These excellent properties provide a promising clue for designing different BX based LHSs. For these LHSs, some fundamental questions will be raised naturally. (1) Could the BX (X = P, As, and Sb)-based 2D LHSs exist stably at room temperature? (2) Will the BX-based 2D LHSs show more excellent characteristics than individual BX materials? (3) What is the real performance of the BX-based 2D LHSs in practical devices? To answer these questions, we proposed four different BX-based LHSs, namely BP–BAs and BAs–BSb with different annectent chiralities, and investigated their physical properties systematically, including crystal structures, stabilities, electronic properties, and photon absorption abilities based on first principles calculation methods. Furthermore, the photocurrent combined with the photon responsivity, external quantum efficiency and energy conversion efficiency were also studied by building BX-based LHS two-probe nanodevices. We found that the BX-based LHSs are very robust even at room temperature, and show superior properties for optical absorption and photocurrent transport. Our new designed BX-based LHSs are appealing as stable and novel 2D solar cell materials, and may have profound implications for the experimental design of 2D photoelectric devices.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the computational methods used in this investigation are briefly introduced. In Section 3, the numerical results are presented, including the crystal stabilities, electronic properties, optical absorption, and photoelectric conversion capabilities of the proposed LHS materials, and the underlining physical meaning is also analyzed in detail. In Section 4, a brief summary of this investigation is presented.
2 Computational methods
The structure optimization, stability assessment, and electric and photoelectric behavior investigation for the proposed 2D BP–BAs and BAs–BSb LHSs were implemented by the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).40 The exchange–correlation functional was dealt with the generalized gradient approximation at Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) level.41 The first Brillouin zone was integrated by using the Monkhorst–Pack scheme of k-point sampling, and the cutoff energy for the expansion of plane-wave function was set at 450 eV.42 A vacuum of 16 Å perpendicular to the 2D plane was used to demonstrate a finite layer of LHS. K-point sampling of 3 × 15 × 1 was set for geometry optimization and static total energy calculations. The convergence criteria were restricted to less than 10−5 eV for energy and 0.01 eV Å−1 in force. In addition, the phonon spectrum was computed by adopting the Phonopy code,43 and the thermal stability of the proposed LHS was verified by performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a 3 × 3 supercell under a temperature of 500 K for 3000 fs with a 3 fs time step. Additionally, the band structure and optical absorption of the 2D BP–BAs and BAs–BSb LHSs were also examined at the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06) level.44
The photovoltaic transport calculation for the BP–BAs and BAs–BSb LHS based nanodevices was performed using the state-of-the-art first principles code NanoDcal,12,45,46 which uses a combination of non-equilibrium Green’s function (NEGF) and density functional theory (DFT).46 During the calculation, the exchange–correlation potential was also handled at PBE level,47 and the norm-conserving nonlocal pseudo-potential48 was employed to define the atomic cores. In addition, 24 × 1 k-meshed grids perpendicular to the transport direction were set in self-consistent calculation, and 256 × 1 k-meshed grids were adopted in a post-analysis process to guarantee convergence of the photocurrent.
3 Numerical results and discussions
3.1 Crystal structure and stability

Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the schematic structures of 2D monolayer BX1–BX2 (X1 = P, As; X2 = As, Sb) LHSs from the top view and the side view with a connecting edge between BX1 and BX2 along (a) the armchair direction and (b) the zigzag direction. To facilitate tagging, these two kinds of LHSs are named armchair LHS and zigzag LHS, respectively, in the rest of the text. Both the armchair LHS and zigzag LHS consist of two different semi-infinite monolayers with the same chirality, which extend to ±∞ along the x direction and stretch periodically along the y direction. In view of the different bond lengths of each BX material, the lattice mismatch is unavoidable in building LHSs. When building the armchair and zigzag BP–BAs LHSs, the lattice constants of BP were enlarged 2.70% after relaxation, and those of BAs were shrunk 2.71%. When building the two BAs–BSb LHSs, the lattice constants of BAs were enlarged 4.78% after relaxation, and those of BAs were shrunk 4.81%. This method of building an LHS using two materials with different lattice constants has been used extensively in previous work, and the maximum mismatch values (4.78% and 4.81%) are much smaller even than the reported GeS–SnSe LHS in ref. 49, where GeS was enlarged and SnSe was shrunk separately with magnitudes roughly equal to 7.55%. In fact, an LHS with a much larger mismatch (25%) has been realized in experiment,50 where a graphene–MoS2 stitched heterojunction was successfully grown up using a CVD method. Although the scaling mode only occurs near the connecting edges for the graphene–MoS2 LHS. which is different from our theoretical modeling ones, it can still to a certain extent make building an LHS with a large lattice mismatch of two individual materials feasible. For all the relaxed LHSs, no defects or wrinkles appear, which reveals the clean and sharp maintenance of the interface for each LHS.

The red-dashed rectangular boxes indicate the unit cells of LHSs in electronic and photoelectric calculations, whose widths along x direction extend to roughly 70 Å. (c–f) Charge density deformation of plane projection and three-dimensional integration for the (c) armchair BP–BAs LHS, (d) armchair BAs–BSb LHS, (e) zigzag BP–BAs LHS, and (f) zigzag BAs–BSb LHS. In each panel, the red vertical lines indicate the interface of each LHS, and the yellow and cyan isosurfaces represent the charge accumulation and depletion near the interface with an isovalue of 0.015 eÅ−3. 
To get more insight into the interconnection and the stability of each LHS, the real space distribution of electric density deformation (dρ(x,y,z)) was calculated, which is the residue obtained by subtracting the individual electric density of both components from the total electric density of the LHS. To model the semi-infinite behaviors of the LHS, a huge supercell was employed for each LHS and the charge was calculated using periodic boundary conditions. The supercell is indicated by the red-dashed rectangular box in Fig. 1(a) and (b) and the length of the supercell along x direction is roughly ∼70 Å (see parameter b in Table 1). We have confirmed that the interaction between the nearest connecting edges can be neglected at this distance, and thus the behavior of infinite LHSs can be modeled accurately by periodic configurations. This distance has also been confirmed in previous work.51 For visual display, dρ(x,y,z) of each configuration is summarized and projected to both the x direction (ρ(x)) and the x–y plane (dρ(x,y)) as shown in the top and bottom panels of Fig. 1(c)–(f), respectively. For each LHS, charge transfer mainly occurs near the connecting edge of BX1 and BX2, which reveals the robust covalent connection and anticipated stability. The maximum values of ρ(x) for the armchair LHSs are larger than those of the zigzag LHSs, which implies stronger bonding for the armchair LHSs than the zigzag LHSs. Besides, the depleted electrons of the BAs side are more than those of the BP side for both armchair and zigzag BP–BAs LHSs, revealing the charge transfer from BAs to BP. Similar behavior can be found for both armchair and zigzag BAs–BSb LHSs, where charge transfer mainly occurs from BSb to BAs.

Then we examined the stability of each BX1–BX2 LHS. Firstly, the formation energies of the armchair and zigzag BP–BAs and BAs–BSb LHSs were calculated and the results are listed in Table 1. The formation energy was calculated using EForm = (EBX1–BX2 − EBX1 − EBX2)/n, where EBX1–BX2, EBX1, and EBX2 are the total energies of BX1–BX2, individual BX1, and individual BX2, respectively, in the huge supercell of the LHS; n is the number of chemical bonds passing across the connecting edge in the huge supercell. As shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), n is equal to 2 for the armchair LHS and 1 for the zigzag LHS. The calculated EForm values are −7.34 eV, −6.09 eV, −7.87 eV and −6.54 eV, respectively, for armchair BP–BAs, armchair BAs–BSb, zigzag BP–BAs, and zigzag BAs–BSb. The large formation energies are comparable to those of the reported BN–BX (X = P, As, Sb) LHSs,52 which indicates the structural robustness of each LHS. The vibrational phonon spectrum and the temporal evolution of the total energy were also calculated to inspect the dynamic and thermal stability of the LHSs, respectively.
In light of the huge computational costs of the large supercells in these two calculations, we decreased the size of the large BX1–BX2 supercells to the smallest unitcells including only one chain of BX1 and one chain of BX2. The schematic structure of a armchair configuration is shown in the inset of Fig. 2(a), where the 3 × 3 smallest unitcells are present. This is reasonable because the determining factor of the stability of LHSs would be the quantity of the connecting edges between the building blocks.28 Once the structures built by the smallest unitcells with more connecting edges are identified to be stable, the BX1–BX2 LHSs consisting of much larger unit cells with fewer connecting edges should have more excellent stability. The main panel of Fig. 2(a) presents the temporal evolution of the total energy versus time of the armchair BP–BAs LHS when the temperature T is equal to 500 K, which fluctuates around a constant value with a very small fluctuation, indicating the thermal stability of the LHS during the temporal evolution. The inset in Fig. 2(a) shows a snapshot of the dynamic configuration of 3 × 3 unitcells of armchair BP–BAs at 10 ps. The framework is well maintained in its initial equilibrium structure and there are no broken bonds, which reveals that the armchair BP–BAs LHS can maintain its structural integrity even at room temperature. Fig. 2(b) shows the phonon spectra of the armchair BP–BAs LHS. The absence of the imaginary phonon mode suggests the dynamical stability of the LHS. Similar properties of temporal evolution of the total energy and phonon spectra are also found for the armchair BAs–BSb LHS as shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). There is no imaginary phonon mode along either the Γ–X direction or the Γ–Y direction, which suggests the dynamical stability of the armchair BAs–BSb LHS. Moreover, from Table 2 we can also see that the EForm of the zigzag LHSs is lower than that of their corresponding armchair ones, which confirms the better stability of the zigzag LHSs. All these features would provide possible guidance for realizing perfect BX1–BX2 LHSs in experiments.

3.2 Electric properties of 2D BX1–BX2 (X1 = P, As; X2 = As, Sb) LHSs
In this subsection, we examine the electronic properties of the BX1–BX2 (X1 = P, As; X2 = As, Sb) LHSs. To evaluate the band structures of the LHSs, a huge supercell is employed for each configuration as indicated by the red-dashed rectangular box in Fig. 1(a) and (b) where the length of the supercell along x direction is extended to 70 Å to model the semi-infinite behavior of the LHS. Fig. 3(a)–(d) present the band structures of the armchair BP–BAs supercell, armchair BAs–BSb supercell, zigzag BP–BAs supercell, and zigzag BAs–BSb supercell, respectively, which are all calculated at PBE level. The following can be observed: (1) All four LHSs possess semiconducting properties with moderate direct band gaps. For the armchair LHSs, both the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM) are located at the Γ points. Meanwhile, for the zigzag LHSs, the VBM and CBM appear between the Γ and Y points. (2) The band gaps of the armchair/zigzag BP–BAs LHSs are larger than those of the armchair/zigzag BAs–BSb LHSs. (3) The band gaps of the armchair BX1–BX1 LHSs are larger than those of the corresponding zigzag BX1–BX2 LHSs. By further projecting the contributions from BX1 and BX2 to each eigen-channel, we found that the CBM and the VBM of the armchair BP–BAs LHS is mainly contributed by BP and BAs, respectively, while both the CBM and the VBM of the armchair BAs–BSb LHS are dominated by BSb. Different behaviors appear for the zigzag BP–BAs and BAs–BSb supercells, whose CBMs and VBMs are contributed by both the left BX1 materials and the right BX2 materials with different contributions. In light of the suitable direct band gaps of these LHSs for use as luminescent materials, it is necessary to analyze their fine band structures in depth and understand their specific application functions.
 Fig. 3  Band structures of (a) the armchair BP–BAs supercell, (b) the armchair BAs–BSb supercell, (c) the zigzag BP–BAs supercell, and (d) the zigzag BAs–BSb supercell at PBE level. The horizontal lines show the Fermi level. For each panel, the contribution from left BX1 and right BX2 is projected to each band with magnitudes indicated by different colors. 
Firstly, we calculated the band structures of all the LHSs by employing the HSE06 exchange–correlation functional44 and the results are shown in Fig. S1.† For each LHS, the energy curves are quantitatively in agreement with the corresponding curves obtained at PBE level (see Fig. 3), except that the band gaps from HSE06 calculation are larger than those from PBE calculation. Interestingly, the band gap differences between PBE calculation and HSE06 calculation are smaller for BAs–BSb LHSs than those for BP–BAs LHSs. This is because the band alignment of BAs–BSb LHSs at the CBM and the VBM is mainly contributed by the BSb side, while the band gap of BSb from the HSE06 functional is almost the same as that from the PBE functional.38 Furthermore, in light of the strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect of the Sb atom, we also calculated the band structures of the armchair and zigzag BAs–BSb LHSs with the SOC effect. As presented in Fig. S2,† there is no obvious influence on the band structures whether or not the SOC effect is included for each LHS, especially near the Fermi levels. That means our focused information on the LHSs, such as carrier mobility and optical absorption, will not be influenced by the SOC effect. Thus we ignored this effect in the next calculation. Finally, we discuss the relationship between lattice constant scaling and band structures in light of the mismatch of two materials in building LHSs. Take individual 2D BAs and BSb for example; as shown in Fig. S3,† a lattice constant amplification of 5% for BAs will enlarge its band gap slightly, and a lattice constant contraction of 5% for BSb will shrink its band gap a little bit, which means the band alignment in our scaled BAs–BSb LHS is a little overestimated. The scaling influence on the photoelectric transport of LHSs will be further discussed later.
To see more clearly the band contribution from BX1 and BX2, the band-decomposed partial charge densities for the CBM and VBM of each LHS and the orbital projection of density of states (PDOS) are presented in Fig. 4. First, we can see from the top panels of Fig. 4(a) and (c) that the CBM locates mainly at the B atoms of the BP domain and the VBM is confined at the As atoms of the BAs side for both the armchair and the zigzag BP–BAs LHS, whereas for the armchair BAs–BSb LHS, as presented in Fig. 4(b), both the CBM and the VBM are located in the BSb side, even though the CBM and the VBM are contributed mainly by B and Sb atoms, respectively. For the zigzag BAs–BSb LHS, as presented in Fig. 4(d), the CBM is roughly equally contributed by B atoms from BAs and BSb, and the VBM is dominated by Sb atoms. Moreover, the transferred charge between the connecting edges is larger for the zigzag LHSs, as shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d), than that for the armchair LHSs, as shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), which indicates a stronger hybridization between the left and the right domains of the former than the latter. Furthermore, the orbital projection of PDOS for each LHS was also analyzed to express a more detailed band projection, as demonstrated in the bottom panels of Fig. 4. For each BX1–BX2 LHS, the CBM is mainly contributed by the p orbitals of B atoms (B-p), and the VBM is mostly dominated by the p orbitals of X2 atoms (X2-p). Based on the above analysis, we can draw the conclusion that the band alignments of BP–BAs LHS are of type-II, while the BAs–BSb LHSs belong to a type-I LHS.

The red vertical lines in the top panels represent the connecting edge of the LHS, and the value of the isosurface is set at 0.001 eÅ−3. The green vertical dotted lines in the lower panels indicate the Fermi level. 
For the type-II LHS, the free electrons and holes tend to separate into different sides of the LHS. When a beam of light with an appropriate frequency is irradiated at the connecting edge of the BP–BAs LHS, the photo-induced electrons transfer from the BAs domain to the BP side, accompanied by the holes moving in the opposite direction. This reduces the opportunity for electron–hole recombination, and eventually enhances the electron transfer from the BAs domain to the BP domain significantly. Moreover, a built-in electric field exists during the charge redistribution in light of the domain separation of electrons and holes, which also facilitates the separation of the photo-excited electron–hole pairs by weakening the Coulomb interactions between them. All these promising properties make the type-II BP–BAs LHS appealing for use in the field of optoelectronic technology and solar energy conversion.53 In contrast, for type-I BAs–BSb LHSs, both the photo-induced electrons and holes transfer from the BAs to BSb, and finally the electrons and the holes are preferentially located in the BSb domain. This would give rise to the possibility of carrier recombination and reduce the possibility of separation of the photo-excited electron–hole pairs through enhancing the Coulomb interactions between them. Thus, type-I LHS is not conducive to applications in solar energy conversion, but is suitable for light-emitting diodes and lasers.54,55 Of course, the typical type-I properties of a realistic BAs–BSb LHS may be a little weaker, considering the overestimation of band alignment in our calculation from lattice scaling.
Combined with the above analysis, we provide a more essential and intuitive physical image to present the difference between type I and type II BX1–BX2 LHSs. For type-II BP–BAs LHS, as demonstrated in Fig. 5(a), the CBM and the VBM in the left BP domain are dominated by B-pz and P-pz, respectively. Meanwhile, at the right BAs domain, the CBM and the VBM are composed of B-pz and As-pz, respectively. Obviously, the energy levels of the right B-pz and As-pz are higher than those of the left B-pz and P-pz, respectively. For the type-I BAs–BSb, as shown in Fig. 5(b), the CBM of the left B-pz is higher than that of the right B-pz, while the VBM of the left As-pz is lower than that of the right Sb-pz. Therefore, the band gap of BSb is smaller than that of BAs, which leads to the band bending of the BAs–BSb compound and forms a type-I LHS.

3.3 Optical absorption and carrier mobility
In light of the potential application of BX1–BX1 LHSs as photoluminescence devices, exploration of the optical absorption is necessary. The optical absorption coefficient, a(ω), for the considered LHSs can be evaluated by56 (1)where c is light velocity, and ω is the frequency of incident light. ε1 and ε2 are the real part and imaginary part of the frequency-dependent dielectric function, respectively. ε1 can be obtained according to the usual Kramers–Kronig transformation, and ε2 is calculated by summation over empty states.57Fig. 6 shows the absorption coefficients versus the energy for the four considered BX1–BX2 LHSs at both PBE and HSE06 levels, where the polarization vector of the incident light is set parallel to the plane. For each configuration, the optical absorption coefficient obtained at the HSE06 level is roughly a right shift of the corresponding curve based on the PBE calculation with qualitative agreement. The absorption coefficient is equal to zero when the energy of incident light is less than its band gap. When the frequency of the incident light is larger than the cut-off frequency, photon absorption appears and increases versus the incident frequency. All the curves possess wide peaks over the range of visible light of ∼1.6–3.2 eV, and the maximum values for BP–BAs and BAs–BSb LHSs can reach roughly 6.2 × 104 cm−1 and 6.2 × 104 cm−1 at HSE06 level, respectively, which are larger than those of the ideal TiNX (X = F, Cl, Br) and KAgSe.18,19

Moreover, the direct band gap values and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) are also important factors for the solar cell systems.58 To further probe the quality of the new designed BX1–BX2 LHSs, we estimate these factors for the armchair and zigzag BP–BAs LHSs because of their type-II band alignments. As seen in Fig. S1,† the direct band gaps for the armchair and zigzag BP–BAs LHSs are 1.17 eV and 0.98 eV, respectively, which are very close to the optimum range of ∼1.2–1.6 eV for excitonic solar cells (XSCs).59 Furthermore, by employing the method used in ref. 60, the value of the PCE, η, of the two type-II LHSs can be expressed as (2)where P(ℏω) is the AM1.5 solar energy flux with a photon energy of ℏω, and 0.65 is the estimation of the band-fill factor. Eg is the band gap of the donor segment, which is equal to 1.23 eV for the armchair BP–BAs LHS and 1.30 eV for the zigzag BP–BAs LHS. ΔEc is the off-set of the conduction bands, which is equal to 0.59 eV and 0.322 eV for the armchair and zigzag BP–BAs LHS, respectively. (Eg − ΔEc − 0.3) is the assumed value of the maximum open circuit voltage. The calculated PCE can reach 23.2% and 15.3% for the armchair and zigzag BP–BAs LHSs, respectively. These PCE values are close to those of TiNF/TiNCl (22%), TiNCl/TiNbr (19%), and TiNF/TiNBr (18%)18 XSCs were obtained by the same theoretical method. Meanwhile, these PCE values are also much larger than the best certified efficiency of the organic solar cell (11.7%)61 and that of the MoS2/p-Si heterojunction solar cell (5.23%).62 These excellent performances for solar absorption indicate that our new designed BX1–BX2 LHSs can behave as ideal parts for excitonic solar cells.
The carrier mobilities, μ2D, of all the BX1–BX2 LHSs were also explored based on deformation potential (DP) theory, which can be expressed as (3)Here, C2D is the elastic modulus; kB is the Boltzmann constant; T is the temperature;  is the effective mass for electrons or holes with the direction in the plane and perpendicular to the connecting edge; E1 is the deformation potential. Deformation potential theory has been used extensively to examine the carrier mobility of 2D atomic structures.63 Based on this model, the parameters C2D, E1,  and μ2D were calculated and are listed in Table 2. The validity of this method was firstly examined by calculating the carrier mobility of graphene. Numerical results show that the carrier mobility of graphene is equal to 3.74 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1 for electrons and 3.22 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1 for holes, which is in accordance with the previous first principles result of ∼3 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1.39 Ultra-high carrier mobilities were found for the proposed BX1–BX2 LHS for both electrons and holes. For example, the maximum value of μ2D is up to 1.37 × 105 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the electron of the armchair BAs–BSb LHS at room temperature (300 K), which is roughly 1/3 of the carrier mobility of graphene. The huge μ2D of the BX1–BX2 LHSs is due to the large C2D, small  and small E1. For example, the  at the CBM of the armchair BAs–BSb LHS is 0.125m0, with m0 being the free-electron mass, which is roughly a quarter of that of the MoS2 monolayer (0.54m0).64 The ultra-high carrier mobilities of BX1–BX2 LHSs further highlight their good application prospects in photoelectronics.
3.4 Photocurrent in 2D monolayer BX1–BX2 LHS nano-devices
In light of the favorable carrier mobilities and optical absorption of the monolayer BX1–BX2 LHSs, we built four 2D nano-devices based on these LHSs and calculated their photocurrents using first-principles calculation methods. Fig. 7(a) shows the schematic structures of the armchair (top) and zigzag (bottom) monolayer BX1–BX2 LHS based 2D two-probe devices, where the source and drain indicated in red and blue are still BX1 and BX2, respectively. The whole scattering region is illuminated by light and the system is set under an equilibrium state. When the photon energy is larger than the band gap, electrons at the valence band can absorb photons and jump to the conduction band accompanied by the generation of electron–hole pairs. Then, the electron–hole pairs will be driven to separate into electrons and holes again by the potential difference between the source and drain, and the electrons and holes flow along opposite directions and contribute a photocurrent. At the first order of Born approximation, the photocurrent flowing into the left probe can be expressed as follows:65–67 (4)where ΓL is the line-width function, fL is the Fermi distribution function, and G</>(ph) is the lesser/greater Green’s function of the two probe system including electron–photon interaction.67 More detailed theoretical formalism of the photocurrent can be found in ref. 66. Due to the reversal symmetry breaking of the LHS, a photocurrent occurs even when the bias voltage between the source and drain is equal to zero. We should note that the potential differences between sources and drains are much smaller than the corresponding band gaps, thus the generated currents only source from the photon excitation.
 Fig. 7  (a) Schematic structures of 2D armchair (top) and zigzag (bottom) monolayer BX1–BX2 LHS based two-probe devices. (b) Photocurrent of the two-probe systems based on armchair BP–BAs (black bar), armchair BAs–BSb (red bar), zigzag BP–BAs (blue bar), and zigzag BAs–BSb (purple bar) at PBE level with the incident photon energy equal to the corresponding band gap. 

Fig. 7(b) shows the photocurrent density, Jph = IphL/S, for each LHS based two-probe system when the incident photon energy is equal to the corresponding band gap. In our calculation, a linearly polarized light perpendicular to the LHS plane is irradiated to the scattering region with an incident power density, Pin, of 103 μW mm−2 and a polarization angle, θ, equal to 90°. We found that the Jph of the armchair LHSs is two to three orders of magnitude larger than that of the zigzag LHSs, and the Jph of the BP–BAs LHSs is also much larger than those of the BAs–BSb LHSs. In light of the optical absorption abilities of all the LHSs being roughly the same near the energies of the band gaps, it is necessary to clarify the enormous divergence of photocurrent among different devices. In fact, other than the absorption ability, there are two important factors in determining the magnitude of photocurrent, namely the potential difference and the band alignment between the two ends of the LHS. As shown in Fig. S4,† the potential differences of the armchair BP–BAs and BAs–BSb LHSs are 0.1382 eV and 0.6254 eV, respectively, which are even smaller than those of the corresponding zigzag LHSs. Obviously, potential difference is also not the decisive reason for the great differences in the photocurrent, so it can only be attributed to the divergence of band alignments. As shown in Fig. 4, the type-II band alignment of the BP–BAs LHS would greatly reduce the probability of electron–hole recombination, and is more convenient than that of the type-I BAs–BSb LHS for driving electrons and holes flowing towards different sides, contributing a much larger Jph. In addition, the band alignment difference between the type-II armchair BP–BAs LHS and the type-I armchair BAs–BSb LHS is much obvious than that between the type-II zigzag BP–BAs LHS and the type-I zigzag BAs–BSb LHS. Thus, the photocurrents of the armchair LHSs are larger than those of the zigzag LHSs. Note that the results shown in Fig. 7(b) are based on the PBE calculation; we believe the conclusion should be still valid for the HSE06 calculation, although the data may be different.
Next, we investigated the photocurrent of the four BX1–BX2 LHS based nano-devices in the visible light range. Fig. 8 shows the calculated photocurrent versus incident light energy, Eph, and polarization angle, θ, at PBE level. For each panel, a broad peak of Jph appears when Eph is roughly between 2.2 eV and 2.6 eV, which is located in the green light region. By comparing the photocurrent with the system density of states (see Fig. S5†), we find that the energy at the photocurrent peak is very close to the energy difference between the two maximum values of density of states below and upon the Fermi energy. The maximum value of Jph can reach around 24 μA for the armchair BP–BAs LHS, 65 μA for the armchair BAs–BSb LHS, 5.8 μA for the zigzag BP–BAs LHS, and 2.7 μA for the zigzag BAs–BSb LHS. The maximum values of Jph are far superior to those of the MoS2 system under the same external conditions68 indicating appealing photoelectric conversion performances for the BX1–BX2 LHSs. Moreover, the Jph of each LHS based device is roughly symmetrical relative to a certain angle, θ. For the armchair BP–BAs LHS device, the maximum value of Jph appears at θ = 90°. For the armchair BAs–BSb LHS device, the maximum value of Jph is at about θ = 45° or 135°. Meanwhile, for the zigzag BP–BAs LHS and BAs–BSb LHS devices, the maximum value of Jph appears at θ = 0° or π. It seems that the photocurrent tends to be larger when the polarization angle is along the armchair direction in the BX1–BX2 LHS devices. According to ref. 69, the photocurrent can be expressed in three terms proportional to sin2θ, cos2θ, and sin2θ. The magnitude of Jph depends on the competition of these three trigonometric function terms. In light of the larger band gaps for each LHS at the HSE06 level, we estimate that the photocurrent peaks will be pushed towards the ultraviolet direction when including the HSE hybrid functional in our calculation. This behavior has been proven in previous work.19
 Fig. 8  Photocurrent density, Jph, versus incident light energy, Eph, and polarization angle, θ, for (a) the armchair BP–BAs LHS, (b) the armchair BAs–BSb LHS, (c) the zigzag BP–BAs LHS, and (d) the zigzag BAs–BSb LHS at PBE level. The power density, Pin, of the incident light is 103 μW mm−2, and the bias voltage between source and drain is zero. 
Finally, we evaluated the photon responsivity, Rph, the external quantum efficiency, τeqe, the energy conversion efficiency. η, and fill factors, FF, which are all essential parameters for describing the photovoltaic performances in experiments. Rph defines the ratio of generated photocurrent to the incident photon flux as (5)where e is the electron charge and Fph is the photon flux. Fph describes the number of incident photons in unit area and unit time, and can be calculated by Pin/(eEph). τeqe defines the ratio of the excited photoelectrons to incident photons, which can be expressed as τeqe = RphEph/e.(6)η defines the ratio of the maximum value of output photoelectron power density, Pout, to the incident photon power density, Pin, as η = Pmaxout/Pin(7)with Pout = JphVd. Here, Vd is the reverse bias between two sides of the LHS hindering the flowing of photocurrent, and Jph is the photocurrent density under Vd. With increasing Vd, Jph tends to zero. The reverse voltage when Jph is equal to zero is named the open-circuit voltage, Voc. Finally, we can calculate the fill factor by FF = Pmaxout/(JscVoc).(8)Here, Jsc is the short-current density and equal to the maximum value of Jph when Vd is equal to zero.
In light of the much larger Jph of the armchair BP–BAs and BAs–BSb based two-probe systems, we mainly focused on these two structures to evaluate the aforementioned parameters, which are shown in Table 3. In our calculation, Pin is set as 103 μW mm−2 and θ is fixed equal to 90°. Eph is equal to 2.41 eV and 2.51 eV for the BP–BAs and BAs–BSb device. For comparison, relevant results for many other reported 2D layered structures are also listed. Obviously, the calculated Rph and τ are very large for the armchair BP–BAs and BAs–BSb devices compared to the others. By detecting the current under reverse bias, the open-circuit voltages, Voc, are found to be equal to 0.07 V and 0.23 V for the armchair BP–BAs LHS and the armchair BAs–BSb LHS devices, respectively. The maximum values of output power density, Pmaxout, are 1.5 μW mm−2 and 2.2 μW mm−2. We take the short-current densities, Jsc, as equal to 24 μA and 65 μA for the armchair BP–BAs LHS and the armchair BAs–BSb LHS devices, respectively, which are the maximum values shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b). The calculated τeqe and FF are also very impressive for these two structures. These results summarized in Table 3 suggest that our new designed 2D layered armchair BP–BAs and BAs–BSb LHS systems are appealing 2D solar cell materials, which may have profound implications for designing novel 2D photoelectric conversion devices in experiments.

4 Summary
In summary, we have proposed a new series of monolayer semi-conducting LHSs BX1–BX2 (X1, X2 = P, As, Sb), and researched their electronic and photoelectric properties using first principles calculation methods. Firstly, the structural, dynamic, and thermal stabilities of these LHSs were demonstrated by calculating their forming energies, charge density differences, vibrational phonon spectra, and temporal evolution of total energy under 500 K. Secondly, these semi-conducting LHSs show moderate direct band gaps, ultrahigh carrier mobilities, and efficient optical absorption, indicating their potential applications in photoelectric conversion. Finally, we built several 2D electronic devices based on these LHSs and calculated their photocurrents by vertically irradiating linearly polarized lights at these devices. Large photocurrents appear for all the devices, especially for the two armchair LHSs in the visible light region, which confirms the potential of these LHS materials for application in low-dimensional photovoltaic and solar energy fields.

 	Fig. 3  Band structures of (a) the armchair BP–BAs supercell, (b) the armchair BAs–BSb supercell, (c) the zigzag BP–BAs supercell, and (d) the zigzag BAs–BSb supercell at PBE level. The horizontal lines show the Fermi level. For each panel, the contribution from left BX1 and right BX2 is projected to each band with magnitudes indicated by different colors.	 

 	Fig. 4  Partial charge densities at the CBM and VBM (the top panels) and PDOS (the bottom panels) for monolayer BX1–BX2 (X1 = P, As and X2 = As, Sb) LHSs of (a) armchair BP–BAs, (b) armchair BAs–BSb, (c) zigzag BP–BAs, and (d) zigzag BAs–BSb at PBE level. The red vertical lines in the top panels represent the connecting edge of the LHS, and the value of the isosurface is set at 0.001 eÅ−3. The green vertical dotted lines in the lower panels indicate the Fermi level.	 

 	Fig. 5  Schematic diagrams of the energy levels at the Γ point for (a) BP–BAs LHS and (b) BAs–BSb LHS.
