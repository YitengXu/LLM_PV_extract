    , Accepted 29th April 2013First published on 30th April 2013AbstractA simple solution-processing method was employed to fabricate panchromatic mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/P3HT–MWNT/Au solar cells. MWNTs in a P3HT–MWNT composite acted as efficient nanostructured charge transport tunnels and induce crystallization of P3HT, hence significantly enhancing the conductivity of the composite. The fill factor of the hybrid solar cells was greatly enhanced by 26.7%.
Solar energy has attracted extensive attention because it is environmentally friendly and renewable. Recently, organometal halide perovskites have been shown to be strong candidates as light absorbers for solar cells because of their low band gap, large optical absorption and good stability in air.1–3 Liquid CH3NH3PbI3 sensitized solar cells have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.54%. However, their stability was not satisfactory because of dissolution of CH3NH3PbI3.2 To solve this problem, 2,2(7,7-(tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)9,9-(spirobifluorene))) (spiro-MeOTAD) has been employed to replace the liquid electrolyte. CH3NH3PbI3 sensitized solar cells combined with spiro-MeOTAD have achieved a PCE of up to 9.7%.3 CH3NH3PbI2Cl sensitized solar cells based on mesoporous n-type TiO2 achieve a PCE of 7.6%. Replacing mesoporous TiO2 with insulating Al2O3 further enhances the PCE of the hybrid solar cells to 10.9%.4 However, the conductivity of spiro-MeOTAD is low (∼10−5 S cm−1).4 Hole transport materials (HTMs) with higher conductivity will reduce series resistance and improve the fill factor of the hybrid solar cells.4
Soluble conjugated polymers have been widely used in field-effect transistors, polymeric photovoltaic devices and sensors because of their easy processability, low cost, and mechanical flexibility.5–8 Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) may be one of the most promising materials for efficient inorganic–organic heterojunction solar cells and organic bulk heterojunction solar cells.9–11 Extremely thin absorber (ETA) solar cells based on P3HT have developed quickly in the past few years. ZnO/CdS/P3HT and mesoporous (mp)-TiO2/Sb2S3/P3HT hybrid solar cells have delivered a PCE of 1.28% and 5.13% respectively.11,12 However, the PCE of all-solid-state solar cells based on P3HT is limited by short exciton diffusion length and dispersive charge transport.13,14 Hybriding P3HT with functional nanomaterials usually achieves attributes of each component, such as optical properties, conducting properties and mechanical properties.13,15
Due to their solution processability, high conductivity and high mechanical strength, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been extensively studied, such as for catalysis, energy storage and photovoltaic devices.16–18 Since CNTs have high conductivity, doping polymers with CNTs can shift dispersive charge transport in disordered polymers to fluctuation-assisted tunneling conduction and promote charge transport in polymer matrices.13,19 P3HT could be firmly adsorbed on the sidewalls of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) due to π–π interaction between P3HT and MWNTs and strong electronegativity of sulfur atoms in P3HT.13,20 In addition, the theoretical study shows that P3HT could self-assemble around CNTs, which would enhance the conjugation in the blend and maximize the interfaces between P3HT and MWNTs.13
The band positions of CH3NH3PbI3 are well matched with those of P3HT for efficient charge separation (shown in Scheme 1a). The valence band maximum (VBM) of CH3NH3PbI3 is lower than the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of P3HT. In addition, its conduction band minimum (CBM) is slightly higher than that of TiO2 and much lower than the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of P3HT. Hence, P3HT may promote charge transport in hybrid solar cells when P3HT is deposited on the quantum dot deposited TiO2 film.11

Herein, we report on the fabrication of panchromatic mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/P3HT–MWNT/Au hybrid solar cells. In the P3HT–MWNT composite, MWNTs act as consecutive charge transport tunnels and significantly enhance the conductivity of the polymer matrix. In addition, P3HT with better crystallinity can achieve higher charge mobility.20–22 Therefore, we employ MWNTs to induce crystallization of P3HT and enhance its charge mobility. The resulting hybrid solar cells achieve a promising PCE of 6.45%.
The structure of the mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/P3HT/Au hybrid solar cell is shown in Scheme 1b. The original spin-coated TiO2 film was assembled with ∼20 nm nanosized TiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 1a). After spin-coating 40 wt% CH3NH3PbI3 precursor solution on the TiO2 film and drying the film at 100 °C for 20 min in a glove box, the composite film darkened in colour (shown in Fig. 1b) due to the formation of CH3NH3PbI3. This was further verified by the corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopies (Fig. S1a and b, ESI†), which is consistent with that reported previously.2 As can be seen in Fig. S2b and c (ESI†), CH3NH3PbI3 nanoparticles were homogeneously and discretely deposited on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles and their average diameter was about 4 nm. The SEM image of the P3HT deposited CH3NH3PbI3–TiO2 composite film demonstrated that the TiO2 film was completely covered with P3HT (Fig. 1c). This would efficiently prevent direct contact between CH3NH3PbI3 and a gold electrode. As can be seen in Fig. 1d, the surface of the TiO2 film was completely covered with the P3HT–MWNT composite and MWNTs were uniformly distributed into the P3HT matrix, which is consistent with Fig. 1e. MWNTs acted as frameworks for the interpenetrating P3HT–MWNT network. Because of the π–π interaction between P3HT and MWNTs and strong electronegativity of sulfur atoms in P3HT, P3HT could adsorb firmly onto the sidewalls of MWNTs. The interface between P3HT and MWNTs was the site where excitons, upon light exposure, were generated.23 Therefore, strong adsorption of P3HT on MWNTs and homogeneous distribution of MWNTs in the P3HT matrix promoted charge transport from P3HT to MWNTs. It would shift dispersive charge transport in P3HT to fluctuation-assisted tunneling conduction. In addition, P3HT wrapped around MWNTs and acted as a barrier for MWNT-to-MWNT charge hopping. MWNTs in the resulting interpenetrating network film acted as conducting bridges for efficient charge transportation among crystalline domains of P3HT, hence efficiently increasing their charge transportation.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of (e) MWNTs dispersed in the P3HT matrix and (f) TEM image of the P3HT–MWNT composite showing nanocrystals of P3HT arranged along the sidewalls of MWNTs. 
Moreover, we observed ∼20 nm sized nanocrystals of P3HT arranged along the sidewalls of MWNTs (Fig. 1f), indicating intimate contact between P3HT and MWNTs. This was attributed to the π–π interaction between P3HT and MWNTs and strong electronegativity of sulfur atoms in P3HT, which facilitated crystallization of P3HT on MWNTs. It promoted electron transfer from P3HT to MWNTs and improved the conductivity of the interpenetrating network film.
The outer diffraction ring corresponded to a d spacing of 0.128 nm (shown in Fig. 2b) and was assigned to (13,0,0) planes of P3HT crystals (JCPDS Card 48-2040). The inner diffraction ring corresponded to a d spacing of 0.213 nm and was attributed to the (100) planes of the MWNTs. It indicated that doping P3HT with MWNTs induced the crystallization of P3HT and enhanced its charge mobility.20,21

The conductivity of P3HT is usually limited by the dispersive charge transport in the disordered matrix.24 MWNTs in the P3HT–MWNT composite induced P3HT to arrange along the sidewalls of MWNTs and acted as consecutive nanostructured charge transport tunnels. Therefore, the P3HT–MWNT composite film exhibited a higher conductivity of 1.79 × 10−3 S cm−1 than that of the P3HT film (1.56 × 10−4 S cm−1).
Mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/P3HT/Au devices exhibited a PCE of 4.12% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.73 V, a Jsc of 12.6 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.45 (shown in Fig. 3a and Table 1). After doping P3HT with MWNTs, further performance improvement was observed. Because MWNTs in the P3HT–MWNT mixture significantly improved the conductivity of the hole transport material, a higher FF of 0.57 was achieved. Finally, the optimized mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/P3HT–MWNT/Au solar cell achieved a PCE of 6.45%. In addition, mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/P3HT/Au and mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/P3HT–MWNT/Au solar cells exhibited incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) in a wide spectral range from 300 nm to 800 nm (shown in Fig. 3b).

In conclusion, we have employed a simple solution process to fabricate panchromatic mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/P3HT/Au hybrid solar cells. Moreover, we have demonstrated that HTM with nanostructured charge transport tunnels and high conductivity can significantly enhance the performance of the hybrid solar cells. Doping P3HT with MWNTs greatly enhanced the FF of the solar cells to 0.57 (by 26.7%). The resulting hybrid solar cells exhibit a promising PCE of 6.45%. We believe that it is a promising way to achieve high-efficiency and low-cost hybrid solar cells. Moreover, the methodology proposed herein can be extended to a variety of other hybrid solar cells. Further investigation into the mechanism of the resulting solar cells is underway.
