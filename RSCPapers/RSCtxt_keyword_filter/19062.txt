    , Accepted 3rd May 2011First published on 17th June 2011AbstractTwo new soluble alternating alkyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and ketone-substituted thieno[3,4-b]thiophene copolymers were synthesized and characterized. We found that grafting 3-butyloctyl side chains to the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene unit at C4 and C8 afforded the resulting polymer (P1) a high hole mobility (∼10−2 cm2Vs−1) and a low-lying HOMO energy level (5.22 eV). Preliminary experiments in bulk heterojunction solar cells using P1 as the electron donor demonstrated a high power conversion efficiency of 4.8% even with PC61BM as the electron acceptor. The introduction of an electron-withdrawing fluorine atom into the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene unit at the C3 position (P2) lowers the HOMO energy level and consequently improves the open circuit voltage from 0.78 to 0.86 V. These values are about 0.1 V higher than those reported for their analogues based on alkoxy-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene. This work demonstrates that the replacement of the alkoxy chains on the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene unit with less electron-donating alkyl chains is able to lower the HOMO energy levels of this class of polymers without increasing their band gap energy.
Introduction
Organic solar cells based on conjugated polymers and soluble fullerene derivatives have the potential to offer low-cost solar electricity by using spin-coating, ink-jet printing, or roll-to-roll printing techniques to fabricate large-area photovoltaic devices on flexible and light-weight substrates.1–4 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells5 have recently exceeded 6%, primarily due to the development of low band gap p-type materials6,7 and better control of the interpenetrating electron donor/acceptor network by using processing additives.8–10 Among these materials, alternating thieno[3,4-b]thiophene and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene copolymers show the best performance with a PCE up to 7.4% when [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) was used as an electron acceptor.11,12 These materials are very interesting not only because of their small band gaps but also due to the possibility of tuning the HOMO and LUMO energy levels simultaneously without affecting the optical properties or the band gap energies of the polymers. Chen et al. showed that substitution of the ester group with a ketone group or/and the introduction of an electron-withdrawing fluorine atom into the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene unit further lowered both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the resulting polymers.11 This structure–property relation allows us to increase the open circuit voltage (Voc) but without increasing the band gap and reducing the short circuit current (Jsc). The polymer based on 3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene with ketone side chain showed the lowest LUMO and HOMO energy levels (3.45 and 5.22 eV respectively) and the best Voc (0.76 V) recorded for this class of materials.11 We noticed that a large energy offset (∼0.9 eV) exists between the LUMO levels of this series of polymers and the commonly used electron acceptor materials ([6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or PC71BM). This energy offset is overly generous for efficient exciton dissociation;13 a slight reduction in this energy offset should not affect the donor–acceptor charge transfer. This gives us an opportunity to further lower the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of this series of polymers to increase the Voc without losing the Jsc. One effective method to lower the HOMO energy level is to replace the alkoxy side chains on the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene unit with less electron-donating alkyl chains.14,15 The combination of such monomer with the ketone-substituted thieno[3,4-b]thiophene monomers will offer new low band gap copolymers with deep HOMO energy levels. In order to keep the copolymers soluble in organic solvents for solution processing, new branched alkyl side chains have to be designed. In this paper, we report the synthesis of new alternating benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene copolymers, P1 and P2, and their photovoltaic performance in BHJ solar cells using PC61BM as the electron acceptor. P1 and P2 showed Voc of 0.77 and 0.86 V, respectively, and a PCE up to 4.8%.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis

Scheme 1 shows the synthesis of monomers 3 and 8. First, compound 1 was prepared in three steps according to the procedure reported for its analogue with a branched alkyl chain.16 Then, compound 1 was converted to the fully aromatic derivative 2 in an 81% yield. The latter was brominated with N-bromosuccinimide to give monomer 3 as a light pink solid in an 83% yield. The monomer 8 was already published in the literature11 but no information was given about its preparation. Therefore, we have developed independently a synthetic pathway for the preparation of monomer 8 in five steps starting from 1. As shown in Scheme 1, the treatment of 1 with ethylene glycol in refluxing benzene in the presence of a catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid offered the desired ketal 4 in a 95% yield. Lithiation of 4 with n-BuLi in THF and subsequent treatment with N-fluorobenzenesulfonimide furnished the fluorinated compound 5 in a 37% yield. Deprotection of 5 in THF in the presence of 3 N HCl solution provided compound 6 in an 89% yield. Finally, the conversion of 6 to the fully aromatic derivative 7 followed by the bromination of the latter gave the desired monomer 8 as an orange-pink solid in excellent yields.

The new branched alkyl substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene 12 was prepared in three steps according to the procedure reported by Ong et al.17 using benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione and alkyne as starting materials (Scheme 2). In our case, the 3-butyl-1-octyne 9 was prepared from 1-octyne. The latter was first treated with 2 equiv. of n-BuLi in hexane. Then, the regioselective alkylation at C-3 position18 with bromobutane gave compound 9 in a 36% yield. Compound 9 was treated with isopropylmagnesium chloride to give the corresponding alkynylmagnesium chloride, which then reacted with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione. After reduction with SnCl2, compound 10 was obtained in a 50% yield. Hydrogenation of 10 furnished compound 11 in a 70% yield. Finally, the treatment of 11 with n-BuLi in THF, followed by the addition of trimethyltin chloride, provided compound 12 as white needles in a 70% yield. As described in Scheme 2, P1 and P2 were synthesized by Stille coupling reaction between monomer 12 and the corresponding thieno[3,4-b]thiophene derivative in refluxing toluene/DMF (10/1) using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. P1 and P2 were easily dissolved in chlorinated solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene. P1 and P2 have relatively high number-average molecular weights (Mn) of 27 and 20 kDa and polydispersity indexes (PDI) of 2.0 and 1.75, respectively.16 We note here that when the two 4-butyloctyl side chains of P2 were replaced by the shorter and more symmetric 3-propylhexyl, the resulting polymer had a lower solubility and precipitated out of the solution during the polymerization. Therefore, the soluble fraction extracted with refluxing chlorobenzene has a lower molecular weight (Mn = 17 kDa; PDI = 1.60) than P2 and forms aggregates quickly after cooling to room temperature. Interestingly, using our synthetic approach, the substitution pattern and length of the branched alkyl chain of the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene unit could be easily tuned to obtain a balance between good solubility and efficient interchain packing of the resulting polymer.19

Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical properties of P1 and P2 thin films were characterized by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 1, P1 and P2 showed absorption maxima at 687 and 676 nm, respectively. These values coincide well with the maximum photon flux region in the solar spectrum (∼700 nm).2 The optical band gaps of P1 and P2 calculated from the onset of the films absorption are 1.63 and 1.65 eV, respectively. These values are consistent with their analogues based on alkoxy-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene,11 which means the replacement of the alkoxy chains by alkyl chains almost has little influence on the band gaps of this class of polymers. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P1 and P2 were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement. Both polymers underwent reversible cathodic reduction and anodic oxidation (Fig. 2). The onset potentials of the oxidation wave of P1 and P2 appeared at 0.82 and 0.94 V, corresponding to HOMO energy levels of 5.22 and 5.34 eV, respectively. Based on the onset potentials of the first reduction wave, the LUMO energy levels of P1 and P2 were estimated to be at 3.41 and 3.53 eV, respectively. Both HOMO and LUMO energy levels of P1 and P2 are about 0.1 eV lower than the values obtained from their analogues based on alkoxy-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene,11 confirming that the replacement of the alkoxy chains on the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene unit with less electron-donating alkyl chains lowers both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of this class of polymers and meanwhile keeps their band gap energy almost unchanged. It is worth noting that the electrochemical band gaps of P1 and P2 are higher than the optically measured ones, as already observed by Chen et al. for the similar polymers based on alkoxy-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene.11 This could be related to the interface charge injection barrier due to the presence of insulating side chains between the polymer film and the electrode surface.20,21

Thermal properties

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis showed that both polymers P1 and P2 are crystalline materials with melting points at 203.2 and 208.5 °C, respectively (Fig. 3). However, P1 has a higher crystallinity and its melting enthalpy reaches 7.14 J g−1. In contrast, the melting enthalpy of P2 is only 3.53 J g−1. In addition, P1 tends to form crystalline structures when it is cooled from the melted state. Therefore, no obvious glass transition is observed during the second DSC heating scan. P2 shows a different thermal behavior. Its second DSC scan reveals a glass transition at 143.7 °C, and a broad melting process above 185 °C. This means that the substitution of the F atom on the polymer backbone slightly increases the melting point but retards the recrystallization process probably due to the asymmetric molecular structure of the new polymer (P2). In fact, it has been shown with some poly(2,7-carbazole) derivatives that symmetric polymers have higher structural organization in the solid state than their corresponding asymmetric polymers.22

Field-effect transistor mobility
The hole mobilities of P1 and P2 were measured using an organic field-effect transistor (OFET) technique. Bottom contact OFETs of these two copolymers were fabricated on SiO2/Si substrates as described in the Experimental section. P1 and P2 were found to exhibit typical p-type organic semiconductor characteristics (Fig. 4) with hole mobilities of 1 × 10−2 and 4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1, respectively. The higher hole mobility of P1 is probably related to its superior crystallinity, as observed by the DSC analysis. It is well known that crystalline polymers produce organized structures in the solid state, leading to considerable improvement in their charge transport properties.23–25

Photovoltaic response
Photovoltaic properties of P1 and P2 were investigated in BHJ solar cells, using a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC61BM/LiF/Al with a device active area of 1.0 cm2. Due to the good solubility of P1 and P2 in both chloroform (CF) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) at room temperature, these two solvents were used to prepare the polymer:PC61BM composite films in order to compare their effect on the device performance. The photovoltaic performances of P1 and P2 were evaluated using a polymer:PC61BM weight ratio of 1:2 and an active layer thickness of ∼100 nm. The devices were tested under AM 1.5G irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a KG5 filter covered silicon photovoltaic solar cell. The device performance data are summarized in Table 1, where the PCEs were calculated using the Jsc obtained from the integration of the external quantum efficiency and the AM 1.5G solar spectrum.

As we can see in Table 1, using only chloroform as the solvent, P1 and P2 exhibited a similar PCE of 2.3% with relatively low Jsc of 6.1 and 5.4 mA cm−2, respectively. In both cases, the AFM images of the polymer:PC61BM composites show large domains with a diameter of about 150–200 nm (Fig. 5). Such big domain size favors the exciton recombination and consequently reduces the charge separation efficiency.1,26 As a result, the photocurrent density values are low. We note here that when 1,2-dichlorobenzene is used as the processing solvent for P1 and P2, the PCE values and films morphology (Fig. 5) are very similar to those obtained with the chloroform. According to these results, one can suggest that the observed large domains are not related to the solubility of P1 and P2 in chloroform or 1,2-dichlorobenzene but to the low miscibility of these polymers with PC61BM.

AFM phase images (surface scan area: 1 × 1 μm2) of the P1:PC61BM [(a), (b), (e) and (f)] and P2:PC61BM [(c), (d), (g) and (h)] composite films prepared using the chloroform [(a) and (c)], the 1,2-dichlorobenzene [(b) and (d)], chloroform/DIO (97/3, v/v) mixture [(e) and (g)] and 1,2-dichlorobenzene/DIO (97/3, v/v) mixture [(f) and (h)]. 
The use of processing additives, such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), has been proven an effective method to modify and control the nano-scale morphology in polymer solar cells.8–10 Therefore, new P1 and P2 based devices have been prepared using chloroform/DIO (97/3, v/v) mixture as the solvent. The current density–voltage characteristics (J–V) of these devices are shown in Fig. 6a and the data are summarized in Table 1. One can see that using DIO as an additive considerably increases the Jsc and fill factor (FF) for both polymers. In the case of P1, the device exhibited a Jsc of 9.8 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.78 V, and a FF of 63% with an overall PCE of 4.8%. As expected, the fluorinated polymer P2 showed a significantly enhanced Voc of 0.86 V, as compared to that of P1. These Voc values are about 0.1 V higher than those obtained with their analogues based on alkoxy-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene11 indicating, as expected from HOMO energy levels, that replacement of the alkoxy chains by alkyl chains is an effective method to increase the Voc of the devices based on this class of polymers. The 1,2-dichlorobenzene/DIO (97/3, v/v) mixture has also been tested as the processing solvent. As shown in Table 1, adding DIO to the 1,2-dichlorobenzene significantly improves the device performance but without exceeding those obtained with the chloroform/DIO (97/3, v/v) mixture. The significant enhancement in the Jsc and FF, when DIO is used, could be explained by the change in the morphology of the blend, as we can see from the AFM images (Fig. 5). In the case of P1, no large domains are present after adding DIO to the chloroform or 1,2-dichlorobenzene, and the domain structure becomes much smaller, indicating a better nano-scale phase separation between the polymers and PC61BM. We believe there is still more room for further optimizations to realize optimum morphology of the active layer, particularly for P2. It is worth noting that there was a slight drop in the Voc when DIO was used as the processing additive. This phenomenon was typically observed in the literature.9 The mechanism is not very clear at this moment. We think it may be related to the formation of a very thin PC61BM-enriched layer on PEDOT-PSS as DIO selectively dissolves PC61BM and has a high density (1.84 g mL−1).
 Fig. 6  Current density–voltage curves measured under AM 1.5G irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 (a) and EQE spectra (b) of polymer:PC61BM BHJ solar cells prepared from mixed solvents chloroform/DIO (97/3, v/v). 
The EQE spectra (Fig. 6b) show that P1 and P2 based solar cells harvest light very efficiently between 600 and 700 nm, as expected from the UV-vis spectra of P1 and P2 (Fig. 1). However, their absorption below 550 nm is weak, resulting in low EQE values in this spectral region. The use of PC71BM as an electron acceptor could potentially overcome this problem since PC71BM has stronger absorption between 400 and 600 nm. This work is presently in progress. In addition, the molecular weight of P2 (Mn = 20 kDa) may be not high enough. We are optimizing our synthetic procedure to further increase its molecular weight.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we report the synthesis of new alternating alkyl-substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene and ketone-substituted thieno[3,4-b]thiophene copolymers. When branched 3-butyloctyl side chains were introduced to the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene unit at C4 and C8 positions, the resulting polymer P1 showed excellent solubility, high hole mobility (∼10−2 cm2Vs−1) and low-lying HOMO energy level (5.22 eV). P1 blended with PC61BM, demonstrated a Voc of 0.78 V and a high PCE of 4.8%. P2 with fluorinated thieno[3,4-b]thiophene exhibited a significantly improved Voc of 0.86 V, as compared to that of P1. To the best of our knowledge, these are the highest Voc values reported for this class of materials. The results presented here show that the replacement of the alkoxy chains on the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene unit with less electron-donating alkyl chains allows us to increase the Voc of these polymers by 0.1 V but without increasing their band gap energy which remains around 1.64 eV. Further improvement in device performance is expected after the device optimization, such as replacing PC61BM with PC71BM and optimization of the active layer morphology by using new fabrication processes.

          2-(3-Fluoro-4,6-dihydrothieno[3,4-b]thiophen-2-yl)-2-heptyl-1,3-dioxolane (5)
In a 100 mL flame-dried flask, 1.51 g (4.85 mmol) of 4 was dissolved in 42 mL of dry THF.

After evaporation of the toluene under reduced pressure, methanol was added and 240 mg of the polymer was collected by filtration (85% yield). Molecular weight (by GPC using chlorobenzene as eluent and monodispersed polystyrene as standard): Mn = 27 kDa and PDI = 2.0. 1H NMR (400 MHz, 1,2-dichlorobenzene-d4, 140 °C, ppm) δ 7.87 (br, 1H), 7.60–7.40 (br, 2H), 3.15 (br, 6H), 2.00–1.35 (m, 44H), 0.95–1.25 (m, 15H).

Polymer
P2

Polymer
P2 was synthesized according to the procedure for the synthesis of polymer P1. Equimolar monomer 8 (153 mg, 0.346 mmol) and monomer 12 (295 mg, 0.346 mmol) were used. After 62 h of reaction time, 12 mg of trimethylphenyltin (0.05 mmol) in 0.5 mL of degassed toluene/DMF (10:1, v/v) was added, and the reaction was kept at 110 °C for an additional 5 hours. 50 mg of bromobenzene (0.32 mmol) in 1 mL of degassed toluene/DMF (10:1, v/v) was then added, and the reaction was kept at 110 °C for an additional 6 hours to complete the end-capping reaction. The polymerization solution was cooled to room temperature and precipitated into methanol. The resultant polymer was collected by filtration, dried, and extracted with hexanes and dichloromethane using a Soxhlet extraction apparatus. The remaining solid was extracted with 250 mL of toluene. After evaporation of the toluene under reduced pressure, methanol was added and 202 mg of the polymer was collected by filtration (70% yield). Molecular weight (by GPC using chlorobenzene as eluent and monodispersed polystyrene as standard): Mn = 20 kDa and PDI = 1.75. 1H NMR (400 MHz, 1,2-dichlorobenzene-d4, 140 °C, ppm) δ 7.82 (br, 1H), 7.46 (br, 1H), 3.22 (br, 6H), 2.00–1.35 (m, 44H), 0.95–1.25 (m, 15H).
Instrumentation

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a 400 MHz Varian Unity Inova spectrometer. Chemical shifts were reported as δ values (ppm) relative to internal tetramethylsilane. The number-average (Mn) molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using a Waters Breeze HPLC system with a 1525 binary HPLC pump and a 2414 differential refractometer. Chlorobenzene was used as eluent and commercial polystyrenes were used as standards. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Varian Cary 50 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was performed on a TA Instruments DSC 2920. DSC traces were measured at a scanning rate of 10 °C min−1, under a nitrogen flow (50 mL min−1). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out under argon in a three-electrode cell using 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 in anhydrous CH3CN as the supporting electrolyte. The polymers were coated on a platinum-working electrode. The CV curves were recorded referenced to an Ag quasi-reference electrode, which was calibrated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.8 eV below the vacuum level) as an external standard. The E1/2 of the Fc/Fc+ redox couple was found to be 0.40 V versus the Ag quasi-reference electrode. Therefore, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers can be estimated using the empirical EHOMO = −(Eoxonset + 4.40) eV and ELUMO = −(Eredonset + 4.40) eV, respectively, where Eoxonset and Eredonset are the onset potentials for oxidation and reduction relative to the Ag quasi-reference electrode, respectively.
Device fabrication and characterization
The hole mobilities of P1 and P2 were measured using organic field-effect transistor (OFET) measurements. A heavily doped n-Si wafer with an overlayer of SiO2 (230 nm, Ci = 15 nF cm−2) was used as the substrate. With bottom contact configuration, sputtered gold source and drain electrodes were used to contact the polymer film. An interdigitated layout was used for the OFET where the channel length and width are 20 μm and 1 mm, respectively. A chloroform or 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of the desired polymer was spin cast to cover the source and drain electrodes. The OFETs were characterized inside a dark box at room temperature under nitrogen protection with a semiconductor parameter analyser (HP4145A). The hole mobilities were calculated in the saturation regime at VDS = −100 V using the following equation IDS = (W/2L)μCi(VG − VT),2 where VDS is the source–drain voltage, IDS is the source–drain current, W and L are, respectively, the channel width and length, μ is the field-effect mobility, Ci is the capacitance per unit area of the SiO2 layer, and VG and VT are, respectively, the gate voltage and threshold voltage.27,28
The BHJ solar cells were prepared on commercial glass slides coated with patterned ITO. The thickness and sheet resistance of the ITO are 150 nm and 12 Ω per square, respectively. The active area of each solar cell device is 1.0 cm2 with a length:width ratio of 4:1. The substrates were cleaned by sonicating sequentially in detergent, DI water, acetone, and isopropanol. Immediately prior to device fabrication, the substrates were treated in a UV-ozone oven for 15 min. First, a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT–PSS) thin film (30 nm) was spin-coated and then baked at 140 °C for 15 min. Secondly, an active layer was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT–PSS from a chloroform or 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of polymer:PC61BM with a weight ratio of 1:2. In the case of the devices using an additive, 1,8-diiodooctane with a 3% volume ratio was added to the solutions before use. Finally, 2 nm of LiF and 120 nm of Al were deposited on the top of the active layer in a vacuum of 5 × 10−7 Torr to form the top electrode. The solar cells (with no protective encapsulation) were then tested in air under AM 1.5G irradiation of 100 mW cm−2 (ScienceTech Inc., SS 500W solar simulator) calibrated with a KG5 filter covered silicon photovoltaic solar cell traced to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics were recorded using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was performed using a Jobin-Yvon Triax spectrometer, a Jobin-Yvon xenon light source, a Merlin lock-in amplifier, a calibrated Si UV detector, and an SR570 low noise current amplifier.
