    , Accepted 1st November 2016First published on 2nd November 2016AbstractComposites of polyaniline (PANI) and cadmium sulfide nanoparticles (CdS NPs) are in situ synthesized by polymerizing aniline in acetic acid medium for different concentrations of CdS NPs. The composites, characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy, exhibit nanotubular morphology of PANI decorated with nanospheres of CdS NPs at their outer surface. The FTIR and UV-vis spectra indicate strong interaction between PANI and the CdS NPs suggesting a good conjugate for photovoltaic applications. The dc conductivities of the composite increase with an increase of the CdS concentration showing a maximum of 1.17 × 10−2 S cm−1 for the C200 sample (obtained by polymerizing 182 μL aniline with 200 mg CdS). The current–voltage plots indicate that the photocurrent is higher from the dark current and the separation between the dark current and photocurrent is maximum in C200. The effectiveness of these composites in DSSCs is studied under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 and the C200 device exhibits a maximum open circuit voltage of 0.73 V, a short circuit current of 8.22 mA cm−2, and a power conversion efficiency of 3.96%. The impedance study of the cells indicates that the lifetime of the photo-injected electrons is highest (1.34 ms) for the C200 sample, explaining the maximum PCE among the composites.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been developed in the last two decades as a promising alternative to fuel and nuclear energy resources due to their simple fabrication process, low cost,1–4 and modular properties.5,6 In a pioneering work, Grätzel and coworkers developed solution-processed photovoltaic devices consisting of TiO2-based n-type semiconducting metal oxides sensitized by dye molecules termed as DSSCs.1 In DSSCs, photoexcitation of dyes causes injection of the photoelectrons to the conduction band of TiO2 and consequently the oxidized dyes are regenerated through electron donation from the iodide/triiodide redox couple present in the system. The photovoltaic cycle completes through the injection of electrons from TiO2 nanoparticles to the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and equilibration of the redox couple via circuit electrons at the cathode.7 The film thickness and the nanoscale morphology of the interfaces of such devices play a crucial role in the performances of the device.8 Thus mesoporous TiO2 can provide an excellent surface area to anchor sufficient dye molecules which leads to a good power conversion efficiency (PCE).9 However, due to the huge interfacial area of mesoporous TiO2, a reverse transfer of photo-injected electrons from TiO2 to the I3−/I− redox couple or to the dye may occur, causing a decrease in the PCE. So replacing traditional TiO2 with other alternative materials will be a great challenge to achieve maximum PCE. Different metal nanostructures based on nanoparticles,10 nanorods,11 nanowires,12 nanotubes,8 and nanoflakes13 have been engaged as photoanodes because of their effective dye binding sites and continuous path for electron movement which reduces the recombination of charges in the device. The majority of the research groups are engaged in modifying the dye to develop the range of spectral absorbance,14–16 and to increase the hole transport and stability of the cell by modifying the liquid electrolyte with ionic solids17,18 or conducting polymers,19 and in improving the transport of electrons using different wide band gap semiconductor materials20 or core–shell nanostructures.21,22 Hsu et al. showed that a DSSC fabricated with a graphene oxide nanosheet–polyaniline nanohybrid/poly(ethylene oxide) blend gel electrolyte exhibited a maximum PCE of 5.63%.23
Composites of conducting polymers and inorganic metal oxides have attracted immense attention because of their unique properties, such as metallic conductivity, good charge transport rates, short diffusion length for ion transport, and highly tunable morphology.24,25 Conducting polymer–inorganic hybrid materials act as a good donor–acceptor system in such devices fabricated with a DSSC architecture. Such hybrid materials are gaining attention because of the excellent synergism between the components making them superior to the sum of the individual ingredient properties.25,26 Incorporation of a conductive network into the semiconductors leads to reduction of the recombination reaction27 and an increase in surface area also provides better dye binding sites. To explore this avenue our lab have developed the utility of different metallic oxide/sulfide conductive polymer nanocomposites as an alternative to traditional TiO2-based devices in our previous studies.28,29 In these studies, we designed polypyrrole–ZnO and polyaniline–ZnS nanocomposites that successfully assisted the diffusion of excited photoelectrons from the dye molecules to the conducting polymers en route to semiconducting nanoparticles followed by ITO to the counter electrode through the load, leading to the reduction of unfavourable recombination processes. However, the PCEs of these polymer–metal nanostructure-based DSSCs are 2.53% and 3.38%, respectively which are comparatively low. To improve the efficiency and to overcome the above inadequacies, we have exploited a newly in situ synthesized polyaniline (PANI)–cadmium sulphide (CdS) hybrid system to fabricate a DSSC. The ease of synthesis, the ability to do various acid doping of the polymer, and the highly tuneable electrical and optical properties make polyaniline one of the most useful conducting polymers,30 and CdS with a band gap of 2.4 eV has good light-responsive properties for photocatalysis and solar cells.27,31 Zhang et al. reported that the PANI–CdS system has excellent visible light photocatalytic activity.27 CdS and PANI have well matched energy levels for efficient electron transfer and an intensive interface hybrid effect emerged between these two materials, causing rapid charge separation and slow charge recombination in the electron transfer process.27,32 The tunable morphology of these hybrid systems also provides a high surface area to maximize dye absorption for DSSC application.
Here we introduce PANI–CdS nanocomposites fabricated in a dye-sensitized architecture with N719 dye [cis-di(thiocyanate)bis-(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4-dicarboxylate)-ruthenium(II)(bis tetrabutylammonium)] as a photosensitizer showing a maximum PCE of 3.96%. The PANI–CdS nanocomposite with a nanotubular structure is synthesized at varying concentrations of CdS nanoparticles (NPs). Different microscopic and spectroscopic techniques are employed to establish the morphology and nature of the interactions between PANI and CdS. Impedance spectroscopy is used to determine the lifetime of the photo-injected electrons and photoconduction mechanism of the system. The work presented here demonstrates a new polymer–inorganic hybrid material for the development of a novel DSSC system.
Experimental section
Materials
CdCl2·H2O, thiourea, aniline, and ammonium persulphate (APS) were purchased from Merck, Mumbai and were used as received except for aniline. The middle fraction of distilled aniline was used for polymerization in this work. Acetic acid was purchased from Rankem (Gujrat, India) and was used as received.
Synthesis of CdS NPs
CdS NPs were synthesized from CdCl2·H2O and thiourea in ethylene glycol medium.33,34 1 mmol CdCl2 and 3 mmol thiourea were mixed into the ethylene glycol (20 mL) and stirred for 10 minutes. The solution was then placed in an oil bath at 180 °C and the reaction was continued for 2 h. The yellow colour precipitate thus obtained was separated by centrifugation and was washed with absolute ethanol and distilled water several times. The precipitate was dried under vacuum at 60 °C for 24 h.
Synthesis of PANI–CdS nanocomposites
PANI–CdS composites were synthesized by polymerization of aniline (182 μL) in the presence of different concentrations of CdS (25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 mg) dispersion and the composites such produced are designated as C25, C50, C100, C150, C200, and C250 respectively. In a typical procedure, CdS NPs were added into 5 mL of 0.2 M acetic acid solutions and ultrasonicated until CdS was fully dispersed (1 h), then aniline was added, followed by addition of an equimolar solution of APS as the oxidizing agent. The polymerization was done at 4 °C for 24 h. The products were washed several times with distilled water followed by methanol and were dried.
Fabrication of DSSCs
The electrodes, with an active cell area of 0.25 cm2, were fabricated on low resistance ITO glass (2 × 2 cm2, 8–12 Ω sq−1) by drop-casting of the PANI–CdS dispersions in chlorobenzene using Scotch tape as a frame and spacer to control the film thickness and area. They were dried in air. The substrates were immersed in a 0.5 mM ethanolic solution of N719 dye. The excess dye from the electrodes was removed by rinsing with ethanol. The solar cells were made by assembling these electrodes with a graphite-coated ITO counter electrode, and were filled with the I−/I3− redox electrolyte. The I−/I3− redox electrolyte solution consists of 0.5 M KI, and 0.05 M I2 in γ-butyrolactone. The cells were sealed with parafilm strip and were pressed together with clips to form a sandwich-type configuration. A small portion of bare ITO glass and graphite-coated glass was uncovered for wire connection to the anode. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of solar cell devices were measured using a Keithley 2401 source meter. The cells were illuminated from the semiconductor side using a 150 W Xe lamp equipped with an AM 1.5G filter (Newport, 67005) at a calibrated intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as determined by a standard silicon reference cell (91150V Oriel Instruments). The spectral response was measured using an Oriel QE/IPCE Measurement Kit fitted with an Oriel Cornerstone 260 monochromator. Dye adsorption in the PANI–CdS-based DSSC of the C200 sample was determined by dipping the cell in a 0.5 mM ethanolic solution of N719 dye for 12 hours. After adsorption of the dye, the concentration of the residual dye was measured using a UV-vis spectrophotometer. Additionally, five known concentrations of N719 dye in ethanol solutions were prepared in the range 0.1–0.5 mM, and from their absorbance measurements at 529 nm a calibration curve was generated. From the absorbance vs. concentration data, the unknown concentration of the residual dye was measured, yielding the amount of adsorbed dye in the cell.
Characterization
For evaluation of the surface morphology, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images were recorded using a JEOL, JSM-6700F FE-SEM instrument. The morphology of the samples was also studied using a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL, 2010 EX) instrument on a carbon-coated copper grid operated at a voltage of 200 kV. The FTIR spectra of the samples were taken from the KBr pellets of the samples using a Shimadzu FTIR instrument (model 8400S). UV-vis spectra of the samples were measured in water dispersion (0.2 mg mL−1) using a UV-vis spectrometer (Cary 8454, Agilent Technologies). The solutions were prepared by dispersing the samples in water, and the spectra were recorded by taking them in a quartz cell with a 1 mm path length. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed from an Omicron Instrument (Omicron Nano Technology 0571) using a focused monochromatized Mg Kα X-ray radiation source (1253.6 eV). Wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) patterns of the samples were recorded using a Bruker AXS diffractometer (model D8 Advance) fitted with a Lynx Eye detector. The instrument was operated at a 40 kV voltage and 40 mA current. The samples were scanned from 2θ = 10–60° at a scan rate of 0.5 s per step with a step width of 0.02°. The dc conductivity was measured by a two-probe method by sandwiching the sample between two ITO conducting strips of 2 mm width placed perpendicularly. The area of the samples was 0.04 cm2, and the thickness of the samples was measured using digital slide calipers. The dc conductivity of the sandwiched samples was measured by an electrometer (Keithley, model 617). The conductivity values were calculated directly from the measured resistance and sample dimensions using the equation: (1)where l is the thickness, a is the area, and R is the resistance of the sample. The I–V characteristics curves of the samples were studied at 25 °C using the same samples by applying voltage from −5 to +5 V, and the current was measured at each applied voltage. The impedance measurements were performed with a Solartron SI1260 impedance analyzer. The impedance spectra of the samples were recorded at a frequency range of 1 MHz to 1 Hz with an oscillation voltage of 10 mV. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements for the cells were performed under an open circuit voltage bias and 10 mV voltage perturbation conditions in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 1 mHz. All the EIS spectra were obtained by simulation of the experimental data using Z-view software and the respective equivalent circuits were drawn. The constant phase element (CPE) values obtained from the EIS results were converted to capacitance values using the equation:35 (2)
Results and discussion
Morphology
Typical FESEM images of the CdS NPs, pure PANI, and their composites are presented in Fig. 1 and Fig. S1 (ESI†). CdS NPs exhibit a spheroidal morphology (Fig. 1a) and pure PANI produced in acetic acid medium shows the usual nanotubular morphology (Fig. 1b). On addition of CdS NPs the nanotubular morphology of PANI is retained until the C200 sample (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1a–d, ESI†). In the C250 sample (Fig. 1d), due to the larger concentration of CdS the nanotubular morphology is lost, and smaller sized nanorods are produced. A careful examination of Fig. S1c (ESI†) for C100 and Fig. 1c for C200 indicates that the surface of the nanotubes is rougher than that of the nanotubes of pure PANI. This is probably due to the adsorption of CdS NPs on the outer surface of the PANI nanotubes. To observe the CdS NPs on the surface of the tubes, HRTEM analysis of the samples is performed (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2a and b, ESI†). Fig. 2a shows that the CdS NPs have a nanosphere morphology with an average diameter of 34 ± 12 nm. This larger value of standard deviation may be attributed to the presence of different sizes of CdS NPs and a careful look at the micrograph clearly indicates that the large sized particles are produced from the agglomeration of the smaller sized CdS NPs. Here ethylene glycol is used both as a solvent and capping agent during the synthesis of CdS from CdCl2 and thiourea. The CdS NPs are possibly stabilized by the ethylene glycol via coordination of glycolic oxygen to the Cd2+ remaining adsorbed on the surface of the CdS NPs. However, during the preparation of the TEM grids the solvents are dried out and as a result smaller sized CdS NPs tend to aggregate to produce larger sized ones. The TEM micrograph of pure PANI (Fig. 2b) clearly exhibits the nanotubular morphology with an outer diameter of 209 ± 13 nm. In Fig. 2c and Fig. S2a and b (ESI†) the TEM micrographs of the C200 and C100 and C150 samples are shown. In the micrographs the nanotubular morphology is observed in all cases. It is important to note that the C100, C150, and C200 samples have average values of outer diameter of 216 ± 18, 234 ± 16, and 279 ± 12 nm. So it may be inferred from this result that there is a gradual increase of the outer diameter of PANI nanotubes due to the gradual adherence of CdS NPs on the surface of the PANI nanotubes with an increase in the CdS concentration. In the C200 sample the outer diameter value is almost equal to the summation of two CdS NPs and the outer diameter of the PANI nanotube, indicating a uniformly coated nanotube with CdS NPs. Fig. 2d shows that the C250 sample exhibits a small sized nanorod morphology (diameter = 106 ± 11 nm) instead of a nanotubular morphology. The PANI nanotubes are usually produced from the vesicle template of phenazine (produced from the initial stage of oxidation of aniline) by the stacking of N-phenyl phenazines which act as initiation centres to form the supramolecular vesicle which agglomerates to form the nanotube.36 200 mg of CdS is the critical concentration of CdS up to which the supramolecular vesicle can aggregate without much difficulty, but on addition of 250 mg of CdS (C250) in the polymerization medium the self-aggregation of vesicles is hampered and smaller sized nanorods are produced. The CdS NPs however remain on the outer surface of the PANI nanorods. In Fig. S2c (ESI†) the EDS spectrum of C200 is presented and it clearly indicates the presence of PANI and CdS in the hybrid systems. The force of adhering of CdS NPs on the PANI nanotube surface may be due to the interaction of polaronic charges of nitrogen atoms of doped PANI with the CdS NPs and is discussed below.

FTIR spectroscopy
To understand the nature of interaction between PANI and CdS the FTIR spectra of the PANI–CdS composites are presented in Fig. 3. For pure PANI the absorption peak at about 1582 cm−1 arises mainly from both CN and CC stretching of the quinoid diimine unit; the peak at about 1510 cm−1 is the CC bond stretching vibration peak in the benzene ring; the peak at 1314 cm−1 represents the stretching band for C–N vibration of the secondary aromatic amine, and the band at 1153 cm−1 arises due to the vibration of a polaron band (Q = N+H–B or B–N+H–B; where Q is quinoid and B is benzenoid) formed due to doping of PANI. The vibration band at 826 cm−1 is the C–H bond bending vibration peak of the outer surface in the disubstituted benzene ring. These characteristic bands confirm that the PANI remains in a conducting emeraldine salt (ES) phase.37–39 In the PANI–CdS composites the bands at 1582, 1510, and 1314 cm−1 shift to lower frequencies to different extents depending on the concentration of CdS from those of pure PANI. The different lower energy shift of these bands suggests that the bond strengths of CN, CC, and C–N are weakened to a different extent. It is interesting to note from the figure that the polaron band of doped PANI at 1153 cm−1 has gradually shifted to a lower wavenumber with gradual addition of CdS showing the highest shift of 12 cm−1 for the C200 sample. A probable explanation may be attributed to the interaction of radical cations of PANI with the CdS NPs. As a result the polaron becomes more stabilized and for this delocalization of polarons, the quinoid and benzenoid ring electrons also become delocalized and shift towards a lower energy. From the FTIR result it is clear that the PANI–CdS composites undergo an intense interfacial interaction causing a synergic hybrid effect between PANI and CdS. This synergic hybrid effect plays a vital role for the separation of photogenerated charge carriers.

UV-vis spectra
In the UV-vis spectra (Fig. 4), the existence of three characteristic absorption bands around 310, 426, and 837 nm confirms the formation of doped PANI. The absorption band at 310 nm is due to the π–π* transition of the benzenoid segment. The shoulder-like absorption band at 426 nm is attributed to the polaron band–π* band transition and the third absorption peak around 837 nm is related to the π band to polaron band transition of doped PANI.40 The characteristic peak due to CdS NPs is observed at 512 nm.41,42 It is very much evident from Fig. 4 that the polaronic band intensity gradually decreases with an increase of the CdS concentration. Generally the intensity of the polaron absorption band decreases with a higher doping level of PANI as the radical cations become more delocalized throughout the polymer backbone.43 So the gradual decrease of the polaron band intensity with CdS concentration indicates secondary doping of PANI due to CdS. It is now necessary to discuss the red shift of the π band to polaron band transition showing a maximum shift of 14 nm in the C200/C250 samples. A similar red shift is also observed for the π–π* band transition which shows a shift of 12 nm. The reason for the red shift of the former may be due to stabilization of the polaronic band due to interaction with CdS where also polarons become delocalized. However, the red shift of the π–π* band is somewhat interesting and it may arise: (i) if the π band is shifted to higher energy due to the interaction with CdS and (ii) due to excitonic coupling of π electrons with CdS. The FTIR results support higher doping due to the shift of the polaron vibration band to a lower energy with an increasing CdS concentration. Also a shift to a lower energy of the benzenoid and quinoid ring vibrations occurs, suggesting delocalization of π electrons in the PANI–CdS hybrids. So it may be argued that the former possibility may be restricted and the red shift of the π–π* transition band of the UV-vis spectra may occur due to excitonic coupling causing lowering of the π* band. Support of these excitonic coupling may be given from the red shift of the polaron band to π* band transition peak of PANI at 426 nm. Usually if the π band to polaronic band shows a red shift, the polaron band to π* band transition should exhibit a blue shift. But there is a large red shift of 29 nm for the polaron band to π* band transition for the C250 sample. This is due to the large lowering of the π* band energy level due to excitonic coupling (Scheme 1). It is to be noted here that the CdS absorption band at 512 nm totally disappears in the hybrids. That may be due to the lower concentration of CdS used in the composite samples. The interaction of CdS with the polarons of PANI (ES) may also be another cause.

XPS analysis
To further investigate the interaction between PANI and the CdS NPs, an XPS study has been applied (Fig. 5 and Fig. S3, ESI†). In Fig. 5a the survey spectrum of the C200 sample is shown. The main peaks of carbon (C1s, ∼284 eV), nitrogen (N1s, ∼399.5 eV), cadmium (Cd3d, ∼404.4 eV), and sulphur (S2p, ∼162 eV) are considered to analyze the interaction between PANI and the CdS NPs. Fig. 5b exhibits the deconvoluted N1s spectrum for the C200 composite which is fitted into three components indicating the three different electronic states: the quinoid amine (N–) at 398.7 eV, the benzenoid amine (–NH–) at 399.5 eV, and the nitrogen radical cation (N+˙) at 401.7 eV.44,45 For pure PANI the binding energy of the nitrogen radical cation (N+˙) occurs at 401.2–401.4 eV.44,45 The positive shifting of the radical cation peak has been observed in the C200 composite compared to that of pure PANI suggesting the charge transfer between the radical cation of PANI and the CdS NPs.46,47 Furthermore, the Cd3d XPS spectrum of C200 (Fig. 5c) exhibits the binding energy value of 404.4 eV which corresponds to Cd3d5/2 for the typical peak of Cd2+ in CdS.48 Fig. S3a (ESI†) represents the XPS spectrum of S2p of C200 showing one distinct peak of S2p3/2 at 162 eV corresponding to S2− in the CdS NPs.48 For pure CdS NPs the Cd3d5/2 binding energy is observed at 405.3 eV and that for S2p is at 161.7 eV.48 The binding energy of Cd3d has shifted towards the negative direction and that of S2p towards the positive direction suggesting interaction between the PANI nanotubes and CdS NPs.46 Fig. S3b (ESI†) represents the deconvoluted C1s spectrum of the C200 composite which can be resolved into four components. The strong peak around 283.4 eV represents the carbon atom of the benzenoid ring with a protonated imine and amine.46,49 The next three resolved peaks at 284.2, 284.9, and 285.7 eV are due to C–C or C–H, C–N or CN, and C–N+ or CN+ respectively whereas pure PANI shows these peaks at about 284, 284.6, and 285.9 eV respectively.47 The slight shifting of the peak positions in the composite from those of pure PANI suggests that the carbon atoms of PANI also interact with the CdS NPs.47

XRD analysis
The structure of the PANI–CdS nanocomposite has been revealed by XRD analysis (Fig. S4, ESI†). The XRD spectrum of the CdS NPs exhibits a set of well defined diffraction peaks observed at 2θ = 24.9°, 26.6°, 28.3°, 43.9°, 48.1°, and 52.1° and they are indexed to the (100), (002), (101), (110), (103), and (112) Miller planes of the hexagonal crystalline phase of CdS, respectively (JCPDS card no. 41-1049).33,50 PANI has two large diffraction peaks at 19.1° and 26.1° which can be ascribed to the periodicity parallel and perpendicular to the polymer chains, respectively.51 The retention of the crystalline structure of PANI in the PANI–CdS system may cause an improvement in the photocurrent activity of the components.
dc conductivity measurement
The dc conductivities of the samples measured at 25 °C by the two-probe method using eqn (1) are presented in Table 1. In the composites, the dc conductivity value gradually increases with an increase in the CdS NP concentration, though CdS has a very low conductivity (2.73 × 10−9 S cm−1).32 It may be reasonable to think that the small increase in conductivity may be attributed to a decrease of the polaronic band gap of PANI by the CdS NPs due to the electronic interaction between them as discussed above. With an increase in the CdS NP concentration in the composites, the polaronic band transition shows a maximum red shift in the case of C200, resulting in the highest conductivity value of 1.17 × 10−2 S cm−1. The C250 sample however exhibits a lower conductivity probably due to the loss of the ordered nanotube morphology.

Photoelectronic properties
The photo-response properties of the PANI–CdS samples are measured from the I–V plot under dark and illumination conditions of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5) irradiation using ITO electrodes (Fig. 6a). It is observed that the curve follows a non-Ohmic relation and the I–V characteristics of the PANI–CdS composites are symmetrical with respect to the polarity of the applied voltage. This type of non-linear increase in current with applied potential can be explained by the conduction mechanism of PANI where charge transfer is not only carried by free carriers like electrons and holes as in intrinsic semiconductors, but is mainly carried by polarons and bipolarons in the doped PANI. With the increase in the applied potential, the formation of polarons and bipolarons also increases rapidly contributing to higher values of current through the sample. The I–V plot indicates that the photocurrent is higher than the dark current and the separation between the dark current and photocurrent is maximum in the case of C200 (Fig. 6a and Fig. S5, ESI†). In order to understand the reversibility of the photocurrent developed by illumination of white light, the photocurrent growth for 100 s and decay for the same time are recorded at a bias of 2 V at a time gap of 1000 ms for several cycles (Fig. 6b and Fig. S6, ESI†). Amongst the composites the C200 device exhibits a reversible turn on and off by switching the white light illumination on and off, respectively. The percent increase in the photocurrent in the first and fifth cycles is presented in Table 2. It is evident from Table 2 that the photocurrent response is lowest for pure PANI and it is highest for pure CdS; about 100 times higher than those of the PANI–CdS composites. This is because of the fact that CdS is highly photo-responsive52 and addition of CdS gradually increases the photo-responsive property except for the C250 sample where small nanorods are produced instead of the nanotubular morphology in the other composites. After the fifth cycle an appreciable decrease in photocurrent is observed in most cases except for the C200 sample. Also the percent decrease of the photocurrent in the fifth cycle from that of the first cycle, presented in the last column of the table, indicates that the C200 sample exhibits a minimum decay (2.45%). A probable reason for the highest photo-stability is that in C200, PANI is well coated with CdS by supramolecular interaction preventing the photo-decay of PANI, and the better photo-stability than CdS may be attributed to the hybrid effect. The photodegradation of CdS may be attributed to photo-corrosion at ambient conditions when exposed to visible light27 but in PANI–CdS, due to the anti-corrosive property of PANI53 and the synergistic effect of the composite, the photodegradation is minimum for the C200 sample. It is therefore evident that C200 is an optimum composition of the composite where photodegradation is negligible and hence it is ideal for making a DSSC device.

A mechanism for the generation of photocurrent under white light illumination can be projected as follows: p-type PANI absorbs visible light and induces a HOMO–LUMO (π–π*) transition by exciting π electrons to the LUMO orbital. As the conduction band (CB) of CdS and LUMO of PANI are well matched in energy,27 the photoexcited π electrons are transferred from the LUMO of PANI to the CB of CdS followed by a flow of electrons to the ITO electrode.54,55
Electrochemical impedance analysis of the composites
The electrochemical activities of pure PANI, CdS, and PANI–CdS composites are investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the presence of electrolyte (LiI and I2 in γ-butyrolactone). The Nyquist plots of the EIS measurements for PANI, the PANI–CdS composites (Fig. 7), and CdS NPs (Fig. S7, ESI†) at a frequency range from 1 MHz to 1 Hz exhibit single depressed semicircles which might arise from the inhomogeneity and structural anisotropy of the samples. The depressed semicircle can be ascribed to the parallel combination of the charge transfer resistance (RCT) and the double layer capacitance (CPEdl) of the PANI–CdS/electrolyte interface.56R1 arises from the electrolyte resistance of the system and the values are almost same (∼8 Ω) for all the PANI–CdS hybrids. It is evident from Table 3 that CdS has a high resistance (RCT) value compared to that of PANI (ES). However on mixing in the composites the resistance value gradually decreases indicating a good conjugation between PANI and CdS due to the synergistic effect in the composite. Usually, samples with large RCT values have a slow charge transfer rate at the interface of the electrochemical system.57 Moreover, among the CdS-decorated PANI samples, C200 exhibits the lowest RCT value indicating that it can deliver the charges at a higher transfer rate.27,46 The capacitance values, calculated according to eqn (2), exhibit a gradual increase with an increase of the CdS concentration in the PANI–CdS composites showing a maximum of ∼3.0 μF for the C200 sample. Due to good interaction between PANI and CdS at this composition and the well coated morphology of the PANI nanotubes by the CdS NPs, a large amount of charge carriers can resonate showing the highest capacitance value.

Dye-sensitized solar cell
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are fabricated with the composites using N719 dye as the photosensitizer and the I−/I3− redox electrolyte. After absorbing the white light by the N719 dye the photoexcited electron enters into the conduction band of the composite and then the respective counter electrode. A reference DSSC with pure CdS NPs is also constructed for comparison. The performance of the DSSCs is evaluated in terms of the open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current (JSC), fill factor (FF), and PCE (η) as these are key factors for the performance of a photovoltaic cell. The J–V characteristics of the PANI–CdS composites at different applied potentials are shown in Fig. 8 and the important parameters are summarized in Table 4. The J–V diagram of pure PANI is presented in Fig. S8(a) (ESI†) showing a very poor photovoltaic performance.

CdS itself exhibits a PCE of 1.62% and it arises due to its intrinsic semiconducting nature with an excellent light-responsive property.31 The results show that the PCE of the DSSCs increases with the increase of the CdS concentration up to a certain concentration and then decreases with further CdS incorporation. The incorporation of a conductive PANI network into the composite may decrease the probability of the recombination reaction, as a reverse charge transfer in the DSSCs from CdS to the dye or to the redox couple may severely reduce the cell efficiency. Thus the JSC as well as the overall PCE (η) are increased. The maximum roughness of the nanotube surface in the C200 sample (cf. SEM images) provides a large area for the absorption of the dye molecules. The amount of dye absorption has been calculated to be 1.07 × 10−7 mol cm−2 (Fig. S9, ESI†). The breakage of the PANI nanotubes for the loading of higher nanoparticle concentrations (C250) causes a decrease in the PCE. These results indicate that incorporation of an optimum amount of CdS NPs in the PANI network (C200) can significantly improve the performance of the PANI–CdS composite-based DSSCs. From Table 4 it is important to note that the JSC values increase with an increase of the CdS NP concentration in the PANI composites showing a maximum for the C200 sample (8.22 mA cm−2). This may be due to the very low RCT value in the sample causing easier charge flow and also due to lesser recombination of the photo-injected electrons, which is discussed below.

Fig. 9 displays the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the C200 DSSC which shows absorption in the range of 300–750 nm and a maximum conversion efficiency of 57.7% at 440 nm.
 Fig. 9  IPCE spectra of the C200 DSSC. 
The internal charge transport process within the DSSCs can be understood well by carrying out electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the solar cell devices. All the Nyquist plots (Fig. 10) obtained from the EIS spectra are simulated using Z-view software and the representative equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 10 (inset). The Nyquist plots are analysed and the values are depicted in Table 5. Three semicircles are observed in the measured frequency range of 1 MHz–1 mHz and these semicircles may be attributed to three different charge transfer processes within the cell. In the high frequency region, the first semicircular shape (Z1) corresponds to the charge transport at the graphite counter electrode. In the middle frequency region, the second semicircle (Z2) corresponds to that of the PANI–CdS–dye/electrolyte interface, and in the low frequency region, the last semicircle belongs to the diffusion of I3− ions within the electrolyte.58,59 From the Z1, Z2, and Z3 semicircles, the respective resistance of the graphite/electrolyte interfacial resistance (RCE), PANI–CdS–dye/electrolyte interface (Rrc), I3− ion diffusion resistance (Rd), the corresponding capacitance of the counter electrode/electrolyte interface (CCE), CPEμ due to chemical capacitance (Cμ), and I3− ion diffusion capacitance (Cd) are estimated and summarized in Table 5. The lifetime (τ) of photo-injected electrons has been calculated using eqn (3): τ = Rrc × Cμ(3)

R
sh represents the electron transport resistance of the working electrode to the counter electrode. From the Nyquist plot and the fitted results it is clear that the Rsh value is nearly the same for all the composites and the RCE values are also invariant due to the same substrate and electrodes. The recombination resistance of the interface Rrc is highest for C200 which means that there is less recombination of electrons at the PANI–CdS–dye/electrolyte interface. The chemical capacitance is found to be also higher for the C200 sample indicating that the stability of photo-injected electrons is highest in this sample. This is probably due to the good nanotubular morphology of PANI whose surface is fully adhered with CdS NPs where photo-injected electrons can resonate within the system for a longer period. A combination of Rrc and Cμ yields the longest lifetime showing the highest efficiency of C200 amongst the composites.60 The impedance spectra of the DSSC of pure PANI is shown in Fig. S8b (ESI†) and from Table 5 it is evident that Rrc and the lifetime of photo-injected electrons are very low causing very poor efficiency.
Pure PANI has a very low VOC value (0.42 V) and CdS has a VOC value of 0.72 V. So in PANI as the amount of CdS increases the VOC value increases showing a maximum (0.73) for the C200 sample. This may be attributed to the increase of Rrc and also the lifetime of photo-injected electrons. This reflects the suppression of back reactions of the photo-injected electrons with the electrolyte present in the cell.61,62 The lower VOC value at the C250 sample may be attributed to the decrease of both Rrc and the lifetime of the photo-injected electrons.
A schematic diagram shows the operational principle of the PANI–CdS composite-based DSSC. As CdS and PANI are well-matched in energy level,27 the conduction band of CdS is located in closer proximity to the LUMO of PANI63,64 which facilitates the charge separation process. The relative energy levels of p-type PANI and n-type CdS are shown in Scheme 2. The LUMO of PANI receives electrons from the photoexcited dye, and the excited electrons can pass through the PANI tube to the conduction band of CdS without any obstruction. Because the CdS is adhered to the conducting PANI tube, the collected electrons therefore pass from PANI to CdS to ITO quickly.
 Scheme 2  Schematic model for operation of the PANI–CdS composite-based DSSCs. 
It is necessary to compare here the PCE of the PANI–ZnS and PANI–CdS composites. The former exhibits a lower PCE (3.38%) than that of the latter. A possible explanation may be offered from the standard reduction potential of Zn and Cd which is −0.763 and −0.40 V respectively. The higher reduction potential value of Cd indicates that Cd2+ ions can more easily accept electrons from the polaronic band of PANI than Zn2+ can in their respective sulfides. This easier transfer of photo-injected electrons from PANI in the PANI–CdS DSSC yields a higher PCE (3.96%) than that of the PANI–ZnS DSSC (3.38%).
Conclusions
The in situ synthesized PANI–CdS composites exhibit a nanotubular morphology of PANI decorated with nanospheres of CdS NPs at the surface. A strong interaction between PANI and the CdS NPs as evidenced from FTIR, UV-vis, and XPS spectra suggests a good conjugate with a synergistic property for photovoltaic applications. The X-ray results of the composite indicate that the crystalline structure of PANI remains intact facilitating a good transport property of the hybrid and C200 exhibits a maximum dc conductivity of 1.17 × 10−2 S cm−1. From the impedance spectra of the composites the calculated RCT values show a drastic decrease with CdS concentration and C200 exhibits the lowest RCT value facilitating the highest transfer rate. The I–V plots indicate that the photocurrent is higher from the dark current and the separation between the dark current and photocurrent is maximum in C200, also showing a good reversibility under on–off conditions. Amongst the composites, the C200 device exhibits the maximum PCE of 3.96%. The IPCE spectrum of the C200 DSSC shows absorption in the range of 300–750 nm with a maximum conversion efficiency of 57.7%. The impedance study of the cells indicates that the lifetime of photo-injected electrons is highest (1.34 ms) for the C200 sample explaining the maximum PCE amongst the composites. The PANI–CdS hybrid exhibits an 18% higher PCE than that of the PANI–ZnS system and it has been attributed to the higher standard reduction potential of cadmium than zinc.
