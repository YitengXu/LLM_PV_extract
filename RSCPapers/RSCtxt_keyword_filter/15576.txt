    , Accepted 12th April 2020First published on 15th April 2020AbstractA medium-bandgap acceptor IBCT based on an 2-(1-oxo-1,2-dihydro-3H-benzo[b]cyclopenta[d]thiophen-3-ylidene)malononitrile end unit was developed. IBCT has an optical bandgap of 1.65 eV and afforded a power conversion efficiency of 11.26% and an open-circuit voltage of 1.02 V in single-junction organic solar cells when blending with a wide-bandgap copolymer donor L1. The L1:IBCT solar cell was further used as the front cell in tandem solar cells, yielding a 15.25% efficiency. IBCT is among the best medium-bandgap acceptors.
Thanks to the emergence of acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) nonfullerene acceptors, remarkable progress has been made in organic solar cells (OSCs) in the last 4 years.1–3 High power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 18.22% have been achieved from the state-of-the-art single-junction OSCs with a blend of a low-bandgap (LBG) A–D–A acceptor and a wide-bandgap (WBG) donor.4–20 Besides LBG acceptors, the medium-bandgap (MBG) acceptors (i.e. optical bandgap (Eoptg) 1.6–1.9 eV) also received considerable attention. Solar cells with a MBG acceptor and a WBG donor can fully harvest the short-wavelength light and generate high open-circuit voltages (Voc), making them ideal front sub-cells for tandem solar cells.21–24 For instance, Chen et al. reported a MBG nonfullerene acceptor F-M with an Eoptg of 1.65 eV. Solar cells based on F-M and a copolymer donor PBDB-T afforded a PCE of 10.08% and a high Voc of 0.98 V.25 Tandem solar cells with PBDB-T:F-M front sub-cells gave a PCE of 17.36%, setting a record for tandem organic solar cells.26 However, efficient MBG acceptors are still limited, and only a few can simultaneously give high PCE (>10%) and high Voc (>1 V).27–29 Developing more high-performance MBG acceptors is necessary. In this work, we synthesized a new MBG acceptor IBCT by using an end unit 2-(1-oxo-1,2-dihydro-3H-benzo[b]cyclopenta[d]thiophen-3-ylidene)malononitrile (BCT) (Fig. 1). Compared with the conventional 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) unit, BCT shows weaker electron-withdrawing capability and a larger molecular plane. Consequently, IBCT possesses a relatively large Eoptg of 1.65 eV and good electron mobility. Single-junction solar cells based on IBCT and a WBG copolymer donor L1 (ref. 30) gave a PCE of 11.26% and a Voc of 1.02 V. Tandem solar cells with L1:IBCT front cells gave a PCE of 15.25%.
 Fig. 1  The structures of IBCT and L1. 
The synthetic route for BCT and IBCT is shown in Fig. 2a. Benzo[b]thiophene-2-carboxylic acid was converted to benzo[b]thiophene-2-carbonyl chloride followed by reacting with AlCl3 and malonyl dichloride to give 1H-benzo[b]cyclopenta[d]thiophene-1,3(2H)-dione in 33% yield. Then, 1H-benzo[b]cyclopenta[d]thiophene-1,3(2H)-dione was condensed with malononitrile to give BCT in 85% yield. Interestingly, only one isomer was observed for BCT. The isomer in the parenthesis was not obtained probably due to the steric repulsion between the nitrile group and the hydrogen atom (Fig. 2a). BCT was further condensed with IDT-CHO to give IBCT in 70% yield. All compounds were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectrometry. The structure of BCT was confirmed by single-crystal XRD analysis (Fig. 2b). The side view shows the good planarity of BCT.

The absorption spectra for IBCT in chloroform and as film are shown in Fig. 3a. In solution, IBCT shows an absorption band at 550–700 nm, with a peak at 658 nm. For film, this peak shifts to 687 nm, suggesting the J-aggregation of IBCT in the solid state. The absorption onset for IBCT film is 751 nm, corresponding to an Eoptg of 1.65 eV. We note that a reported analogue IDIC with IC end unit shows an Eoptg of 1.62 eV.31 The larger Eoptg of IBCT than IDIC could be due to the weaker electron-withdrawing capability of BCT than IC unit, since the benzothiophene moiety is more electron-rich than the benzene moiety. The L1 film shows absorption at 450–620 nm, which is complementary with that of IBCT. The energy levels for IBCT were estimated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S7†).32 IBCT shows a HOMO level of −5.50 eV and a LUMO level of −3.70 eV (Fig. 3b). The donor L1 shows a HOMO level of −5.45 eV and a LUMO level of −2.79 eV.30

Conventional solar cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/L1:IBCT/PDIN/Al were made. J–V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The performance data are listed in Table 1. The D/A ratio, active layer thickness and additive content were optimized for the solar cells (Tables S1–S3†). The best cells gave a PCE of 11.26%, with a Voc of 1.02 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.07 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 73.5%. These cells have a D/A ratio of 1:1.2 (w/w), an active layer thickness of 125 nm and 0.7 vol% 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) as the additive. CN improved Jsc and FF effectively. The cells without CN gave a PCE of 9.58%, with a Voc of 1.02 V, a Jsc of 13.43 mA cm−2 and a FF of 69.8%. The EQE spectra indicate that CN addition enhanced EQE at 340–770 nm, thus improving Jsc effectively. The integrated current densities for the cells without and with CN are 13.02 mA cm−2 and 14.42 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with J–V results. The exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) for the cells without and with CN are 96.6% and 97.7%, respectively, suggesting CN enhances charge generation (Fig. S8†).33 Hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) were measured by using space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S9, S10 and Table S4†).34 L1:IBCT blend film with CN shows simultaneously enhanced μh and μe of 5.56 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and more balanced charge carrier transport (Table S4†). The μe of 2.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 also indicates the good electron-transporting capability of IBCT. We studied bimolecular recombination by plotting Jsc against light intensity (Plight) (Fig. S11†).35 The data were fitted to a power law: Jsc ∝ Plightα. The α values for the cells without and with CN are 0.965 and 0.969, respectively, suggesting the addition of CN suppressed bimolecular recombination in the active layer. Faster and more balanced charge transport as well as less charge recombination account for the higher Jsc and FF for the cells with CN additive. The morphology for the active layer without and with CN was studied by using atomic force microscope (AFM) (Fig. S12†). After adding CN, the active layer became coarser and showed clearer nanofiber structures, which might favor charge generation and transport, thus improving Jsc and FF.

Fig. 5 and Table S5† summarize the photovoltaic performance of those reported MBG acceptors (1.6 eV < Eoptg < 1.9 eV). IBCT is one of the few MBG acceptors that can simultaneously give high PCE (>10%) and high Voc (>1 V) in single-junction organic solar cells. This suggests that IBCT cells can be used as the front cells in tandem solar cells. We made tandem cells by using a L1:IBCT front cell and a near-infrared-absorbing L1:Y6 (ref. 6) rear cell (Fig. 6). The device configuration is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/L1:IBCT/ZnO/M-n-PEDOT:PSS/M-PEDOT:PSS/L1:Y6/PDIN/Al. The tandem cells gave a PCE of 15.25%, with a Voc of 1.82 V, a Jsc of 11.77 mA cm−2 and a FF of 71.2%. The 1.82 V Voc is close to the sum of that of the front cell (1.02 V) and the rear cell (0.83 V),6 suggesting good ohmic contact realized by the interconnecting layer.26 The 15.25% PCE is among the highest efficiencies achieved for organic tandem solar cells to date.

Conclusions
An efficient MBG acceptor IBCT with BCT end units was developed. IBCT is one of the few MBG acceptors that can simultaneously give high PCE (>10%) and high Voc (>1 V) in organic solar cells. L1:IBCT solar cells gave a PCE of 11.26% and Voc of 1.02 V. Tandem solar cells with L1:IBCT front cells offered a PCE of 15.25%, which is among the highest efficiencies for organic tandem solar cells to date. We are trying more applications of IBCT in tandem solar cells to get high performance.
