    , Accepted 13th August 2015First published on 19th August 2015AbstractA solution processed acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) small molecule with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as the central building block and 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-rhodanine as the terminal unit, DRCN8TT, was designed and synthesized. The optimized power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.11% was achieved, which is much higher than that of its analogue molecule DRCN8T. The improved performance was ascribed to the morphology which consisted of small, highly crystalline domains that were nearly commensurate with the exiton diffusion length.
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted increasing attention due to their advantageous properties, such as light weight, low-cost, flexibility, and solution-processability.1 Currently, OPVs are mainly based on two types of electron donor materials, polymers and small molecules. Compared with polymer-based OPVs (P-OPVs), small molecule-based OPVs (SM-OPVs) have some distinct advantages, including a well-defined chemical structure and, therefore, no batch-to-batch variation of the components comprising a device; and versatile chemical structures which enable a more facile control over the energy level.2 The performances of both polymer-3 and small molecule-based4 OPVs (SM-OPVs) are essentially the same, with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) >10%. The marked improvement of SM-OPVs can be mainly ascribed to the newly designed small molecules and device optimization. Unlike the conventional OPV polymers, where the donor–acceptor structures are incorporated into a single copolymer chain, the molecular design of SM-OPVs imparts tremendous versatility to the design of the fundamental building blocks.
In general, the most important building blocks in SM-OPVs are the electron donor aromatic building blocks, such as benzodithiophene (BDT), dithienosilole (DTS), benzothiadiazole (BT), etc. The design of a new OPV material reduces to the development of a strategy to design, optimize and arrange these aromatic building blocks in the final molecule structures. One such strategy is the fusion of single-ring aromatic blocks. This suppresses intramolecular rotation, enabling good π-electron delocalization along the entire molecule, and promotes intermolecular interactions, specifically the p–p stacking of the fused rings in the solid state, which improve light absorption and charge mobility.5 The thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) block, a fusion of 2,2′-bithiophene blocks, has a stable quinoidal structure, narrow energy band gap, and tendency to exhibit strong intermolecular interactions and packing.6 Therefore, the TT unit has been extensively used in conjugated polymers to obtain high-performance organic field-effect transistors7 and OPVs.8 Yet, TT has been rarely used as a core blocking unit to construct solution processed SM-OPVs with high performance.9
We recently reported a series of acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) oligothiophene based small molecules DRCN4T–DRCN9T, in which the main chains have different thiophene units numbered from 4 to 9 and the same electron withdrawing end group, 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)rhodanine.4b Though not fully understood, the device performances seemed to correlate with the molecular symmetry. Among the DRCN5T–DRCN9T molecules, DRCN5T/7T/9T with an odd number of thiophene units gave the best performance, much better than that of the corresponding DRCN6T/8T. Thus, it would be interesting to design a molecule with the two thiophene units in DRCN8T replaced with one fused TT unit, and to examine its OPV performance.
Here, we designed and synthesized a new small molecule DRCN8TT using TT as the central unit to replace the two central thiophene units in DRCN8T. The new molecule has the same spatial symmetry as that of DRCN8T (Scheme 1). Its photovoltaic performance was systematically investigated and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.11% was achieved with an optimized thermal annealing treatment under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2), which is much better than that of DRCN8T and very close to the analogue molecules (DRCN7T) having a different symmetry.10 The results indicate that significant improvement can be achieved with a minor change in the OPV molecules, highlighting the strong need for a delicate and balanced molecular design to achieve a high performance.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures of DRCN8T and DRCN8TT. 
The detailed synthetic procedures and the characterization data for DRCN8TT are presented in the ESI.† The structure of DRCN8TT was confirmed using NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. DRCN8TT showed good thermal stability with 5% weight loss (Td) occurring at 395 °C under nitrogen (Fig. S1, ESI†), which is comparable to the analogue molecules DRCN5T–DRCN9T.4b
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the dilute solutions of DRCN8TT in chloroform and in the solid state are shown in Fig. 1. In CHCl3 solution, DRCN8TT shows an absorption peak at 533 nm and a maximum absorption coefficient of 7.87 × 104 M−1 cm−1. In the thin film, the spectrum was broadened and obviously red-shifted with a peak at 608 nm. The optical band gap of DRCN8TT is estimated to be 1.62 eV. The electrochemical properties of DRCN8TT were investigated via cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S2, ESI†). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) calculated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials are −5.08 and −3.46 eV, respectively. The electrochemical band gap of DRCN8TT is estimated to be 1.62 eV, consistent with the optical band gap. The absorption and CV data are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†) along with the results for DRCN8T for comparison. As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), the introduction of the TT unit to replace the two thiophene units in DRCN8T barely changes its absorption and electrochemical properties. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level were also used to investigate the electronic structure and geometry of DRCN8TT (Fig. 2). The optimized geometry of DRCN8TT has a centro-symmetric structure. However, unlike that of DRCN8T with a nearly planar structure, DRCN8TT showed a dihedral angle of 29.82° between the TT unit and its adjacent thiophene unit. The indicated dihedral angle might break the great aggregation tendency of fully planar molecules like DRCN8T, thus leading to a very different morphology in contrast to that of DRCN8T. Still, the electron density of the HOMO and LUMO extended over the molecular backbone. In addition, the HOMO and LUMO exhibit different patterns of delocalization, e.g., the HOMO is more localized near the central unit of the molecule, while the LUMO is more localized towards the terminal part. This is in contrast to that for DRCN8T.

The BHJ solar cells were fabricated using DRCN8TT as the electron donor with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DRCN8TT:PC71BM/PFN/Al (where PFN is poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)]11). A range of active layer compositions (DRCN8TT:PC71BM weight ratios), film thicknesses, and thermal annealing conditions were systematically investigated. The detailed device fabrication and measurements are described in the ESI.† Without thermal annealing, the DRCN8TT:PC71BM (1:0.8 w/w) devices gave a PCE of 3.65%, with an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.90 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 9.11 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 44.6%. After thermal annealing at 130 °C for 10 min, the PCE was sharply improved to 8.11%, with Voc = 0.88 V, Jsc = 14.07 mA cm−2, and FF = 65.5%. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices with/without thermal annealing are presented in Fig. 3a and the corresponding average photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. To investigate the effect of thermal annealing on the device performance, the UV-vis absorption spectra of the blend films and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) were measured. As shown in Fig. 3b, in comparison with the spectra of the as-cast blend film, the spectra of the film with thermal annealing show a red-shift of 100 nm and show a nearly flat absorption from 500 to 700 nm with an obvious shoulder peak at 682 nm. As illustrated in the EQE curves (Fig. 3c), a uniform increase in the spectral response across the wavelength range of 300–800 nm is clearly seen for devices with thermal annealing treatment. The calculated Jsc values obtained by the integration of the EQE curve are 8.77 and 13.47 mA cm−2 for the as-cast and optimized devices, respectively, which are within 5% of the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves.

For comparison, the photovoltaic parameters of the optimized DRCN8T based devices are also summarized in Table 1. From Table 1, it can be seen that the Voc and FF of the DRCN8TT and DRCN8T based devices are at the same levels. Jsc is the determining factor that leads to the difference in the PCEs, resulting from different morphologies despite their similar absorption.
To understand the effect of morphology on the photovoltaic performance, we investigated and compared the morphologies of the two small-molecule-based blend films. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S6, ESI†), it is seen that the surfaces of both small molecules mixed with PCBM are smooth with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.81 and 0.53 nm for DRCN8T and DRCN8TT, respectively. However, there were obvious differences in their transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Fig. 4a and b). DRCN8TT showed a better ordered fibrillar structure and smaller domain sizes in comparison to DRCN8T, which are nearly commensurate with the exiton diffusion length, i.e. favourable for exciton dissociation. As shown in Fig. 4c and d, the two-dimensional (2D) grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) patterns for both materials showed multiple, higher order (h00) reflections along qz (normal to the film surface), indicating a long-range order and crystallinity in the blend films of both molecules. However, for DRCN8TT:PC71BM, the lamellar spacing is 18.5 Å (q = 0.34 Å) and the π–π stacking distance is 3.53 Å (q = 1.78 Å), which are smaller than those for DRCN8T (Table S5, ESI†). In addition, the full-width half maximum (FWHM) of the (010) reflection (π–π stacking peak) of the DRCN8TT:PC71BM film is more obvious and narrower than that of DRCN8T. These results indicate that DRCN8TT exhibits stronger intermoleculecular interactions and higher crystallinity than DRCN8T. These results are also consistent with the blend film mobilities measured using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The optimized DRCN8TT-based device gave hole mobility with a value of 6.40 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is larger than that of the DRCN8T-based device (5.77 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). To further understand the morphological differences, the resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) patterns of the blend films are shown in Fig. 4f. DRCN8TT:PC71BM blends showed an interference (q = 0.0160 Å−1) corresponding to a domain center to center distance of 39 nm, which is smaller than that of DRCN8T:PC71BM (q = 0.011 Å−1, 57 nm). The values are consistent with the morphology observed using TEM and GIXD. In comparison to DRCN8T:PC71BM, DRCN8TT:PC71BM had a morphology consisting of small highly crystalline domains nearly commensurate with the exciton diffusion length, which is favorable for charge transport and improving device performance.12

In summary, we have designed and synthesized a new solution-processable A–D–A small molecule donor material DRCN8TT by introducing a fused TT unit to replace the two thiophene units in DRCN8T. With the same centro-symmetric structure as DRCN8T, the DRCN8TT based devices exhibited a PCE of 8.11%, which is much higher than that of DRCN8T. The improved performance was attributed to the preferred and better defined morphology. Taking the results together with that of BDT core based high efficient molecules we have reported,13 which also had the same centro-symmetric structures, these results suggest that there is a suitable balance between the molecular structure and the packing behavior (morphology), formation and control. Thus, it is highly desirable to combine the delicate molecular design and device optimization to strike a suitable balance to achieve highly efficient organic photovoltaic devices.
