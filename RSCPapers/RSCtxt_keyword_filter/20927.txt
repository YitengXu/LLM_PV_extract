    , Accepted 2nd March 2022First published on 11th March 2022AbstractThe main causes of the large open-circuit voltage (Voc)-deficit in kesterite-based thin-film solar cells (TFSCs) are the high concentration of defects, related defect clusters, and poor band tailing characteristics. We report thorough investigations of defects, defect clusters, and band tailing characteristics in Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin films as well as their impact on device performance. Through detailed analyses, we find that (i) the relative concentration of the ZnCu and SnCu defects and B-type [2ZnCu + ZnSn] and C-type [2CuZn + SnZn] defect clusters plays a critical role in determining the kesterite device parameters such as the Voc, fill factor, and power conversion efficiency (PCE) under Cu-poor and Zn-rich conditions; in particular, we observed that the higher Zn content has minimal impact on VCu formation; though, ZnCu shallow donors over the optimal concentration cause the electron sink/electron localization to facilitate carrier recombination and induce Voc loss in the device. (ii) the trend in short circuit current densities (Jsc) is independent of defects and defect cluster concentrations; (iii) band tailing characteristics calculated from the energy difference between bandgap energy (Eg) from external quantum efficiency (EQE) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra can also be affected by the existence of minor secondary phases on the kesterite surface. This work offers new insights and correlations between defects, defect clusters, band tailing characteristics, and device performance, which will help further improve the performance of kesterite-based TFSCs.
1. Introduction
Recent advances in earth-abundant element-based kesterite compounds (i.e., Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS), Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe), and Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe)) have paved the path towards sustainable thin-film photovoltaic (PV) technologies with cost-effective mass production of PV devices in the near future.1,2 However, the reported best efficiency for kesterite-based devices is still close to 13% (with the active area) compared with their Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) and CdTe counterparts.3 It has been demonstrated that the main reason for the poor performance of kesterite-based devices is the high open-circuit voltage (Voc)-deficit (defined as Eg/q − Voc) characteristics, where Eg is the bandgap energy of kesterite and q is the electron charge.4 The intrinsic bulk properties (i.e. high concentrations of anti-site defects and related defect clusters from similar ionic radius between Cu and Zn),5 inherent deep level defects,6 and band tail characteristics7 are believed to be the main causes of Voc-deficit characteristics in kesterite-based solar cells. Among them, intrinsic defects and related defect clusters have been theoretically established using first-principles calculations and cured experimentally through various synthesis conditions like fine-tuning of the compositional ratio,8,9 cation substitutions,10,11 different annealing conditions such as temperature/time12,13 and post-annealing treatment.14–16
Based on Raman analysis, Rey et al.17 revealed that the Cu–Zn disorder from kesterite transits to a more ordered state depending on the cooling temperature and rate, with the threshold temperature for order-disorder transition being about 200 ± 20 °C for Se-rich kesterite. Moreover, cationic reordering tendencies (particularly, Cu–Zn disorder) have also been well demonstrated experimentally on post-annealing treated kesterite-based solar cells.15,18 These investigations revealed that the post-annealing process induces cation redistribution within the kesterite layer, resulting in the formation of optoelectronically benign defects such as VCu and ZnCu. Dimitrievska and co-workers established the defect dynamics in kesterite-based materials as follows.18–22 They showed that (i) the change in the relative intensities of the Raman peaks corresponds to the occurrence of different defects such as VCu, ZnCu, ZnSn, CuZn, and SnZn, (ii) Voc can be tuned by adjusting the composition and concentration of the A-type defect clusters (i.e. [VCu + ZnCu]) and (iii) in Se-rich kesterite, variations in the relative area of the 176 cm−1 and 250 cm−1 Raman peaks are strongly related to the concentrations of VCu, and ZnSn defects, respectively, and optimal concentrations of these point defects are well-matched with the high performance devices.18–22 Despite the fact that band tail characteristics have been well demonstrated using the nonradiative and Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination mechanisms, the precise role of band tail characteristics in Voc-deficit characteristics is still debatable based on experimental results. These band tail characteristics are mainly originated via two processes;7,23,24 (i) electrostatic potential fluctuations resulting from the formation of the high concentration of defects and related defect clusters; and (ii) Eg fluctuations generated by nanoscale local compositional inhomogeneity. There have been three effective approaches proposed to solve band tailing issues in the kesterite system such as (i) revealing the origin of band tailing characteristics,7 (ii) engineering anti-site defects by adjusting experimental parameters,8 and (iii) suppressing cation disordering by distant isoelectronic cation substitutions10 (i.e. Cu site by Ag,25 Zn site by Cd26 and Sn site by Ge27) or by doping alkali elements (Na,28 K,29 and Li30). Given the fact that the defects, defect clusters, and band tailing characteristics from cation disordering have been theoretically and experimentally established in kesterite-based thin films, there have been a few investigations into correlations between defects, defect clusters, band tailing characteristics and device performances.22,31
In this work, the existence of possible defects and related clusters is mainly analyzed using the Raman spectroscopic technique and probed for their impact on various structural, optical, and electronic properties of CZTSSe thin films. By precisely controlling the metallic compositional ratios within the Cu and Zn metal layers, distinct CZTSSe thin films were prepared to examine various defects and associated defect clusters. Furthermore, solar cells were fabricated under different Cu and Zn composition conditions, and their optoelectronic properties, such as device performance, carrier lifetime, junction quality, and band tailing characteristics, were investigated. Finally, we systematically established a correlation between CZTSSe device performance, defects, defect clusters, and band tailing characteristics.
2. Experimental process
The kesterite CZTSSe thin films were prepared by annealing soft-annealed metallic precursors under a mixed S and Se vapor atmosphere. Table S1† (A1–A4 samples, Zn variation) and S2 (B1–B4 samples, Cu variation) show the sample codes for CZTSSe thin films prepared with a different compositional ratio by precisely adjusting the thickness of each metallic layer in the precursors. Briefly, (i)the Cu–Sn–Zn metallic precursors were prepared on a molybdenum (Mo) back contact by the sputtering technique;9 (ii) stacked precursors were annealed at 300 °C for 1 h under an Ar atmosphere to form Cu–Zn and Cu–Sn alloys with smooth morphology;9,26 (iii) the soft-annealed precursors and mixed S/Se powders were placed in a graphite box in a chamber type rapid thermal annealing system and then annealed at 520 °C for 7.5 min;9 finally (iv) the annealed thin films were naturally cooled to room temperature. The CZTSSe solar cells were fabricated with a multi-layered structure of MgF2/Al/Al-doped ZnO(AZO)/i-ZnO/CdS/CZTSSe/Mo/soda-lime glass (SLG). The complete device fabrication process can be found in our previous studies.9,25,32,33 The detailed experimental procedures and characterization studies of each layer are provided in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of CZTSSe thin-films with a different compositional ratio
To investigate the effect of varied composition ratios on the structural, morphological, and optoelectronic properties of CZTSSe absorber layers, the samples were prepared with various Zn and Cu contents, as shown in Tables S1 and S2,† respectively. To achieve this, the Zn layer thickness was increased from sample A1 to A4 by increasing Zn sputtering power, whereas the Cu deposition time was increased from sample B1 to B4 to increase the Cu layer thickness. The composition ratios of these absorber layers determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) are given in Table S3.† It was observed that with an increase in the Zn content, the relative composition ratios of Cu/(Zn + Sn) and Cu/Zn decreased while it increased for Zn/Sn. The Cu/Sn ratio was found to be relatively constant, ∼1.4–1.5 for samples A1 to A4. Similarly, as the Cu content increased, the relative composition ratios of Cu/(Zn + Sn), Cu/Zn, and Cu/Sn increased, but those of Zn/Sn remained constant (∼1.05–1.1) for samples B1 to B4. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples, as depicted in Fig. S1,† show the intense diffraction peaks at 27.2°, 45.23°, and 53.54° for the planes (112), (204), and (312) of the CZTSe crystal structure (JCPDS 00-052-0868), respectively.34 In addition, all the samples also exhibit low intensity diffraction peaks related to the kesterite phase. Aside from the minor hump corresponding to the Mo(S,Se)2 phase located near 31°, unexpected peaks related to the SnSe2 phase in samples B1 and B2 (Fig. S1(b)†) were also found. The field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) images show that all samples exhibit a bi-layered microstructure with a large grained top layer (∼1 μm) and small grained bottom layer (∼100–300 nm) with some voids (Fig. S2 and S3†). This distinct microstructure is typical of kesterite thin films prepared by annealing metallic precursors.35–38 The thickness of the bottom layers in the A series samples increased from sample A1 to A4 (increased Zn content). However, no noticeable change in the thickness ratio of the bi-layered structure was observed. The interfacial Mo(S,Se)2 layer was formed at the interface between the CZTSSe absorber layer and Mo back contact in all samples. Surface FE-SEM images of the B series samples show well-faceted surfaces compared to those of the A series samples. Furthermore, the B series samples had larger grain sizes and voids at the bottom of the absorber layer than samples from the A series.
3.2 Defect and defect cluster analysis of CZTSSe thin-films
Generally, the Raman spectra of kesterite samples show A and B modes due to anionic and cationic vibrations, respectively.24 According to the photon density of states (PDOS) for the kesterite crystal structure, the anionic Se vibrations are responsible for most of the observed A-modes. On the other hand, B-modes are detected as a result of cationic vibrations. The PDOS studies showed that low frequency modes ranging from 150 to 200 cm−1 are caused by vibrations involving Cu and Zn, while the high frequency modes ranging from 200 to 250 cm−1 are caused by vibrations involving Sn and Zn. The absorber composition determines the concentration of a certain defect, as the element's high abundance or chemical potential facilitates the formation pathway throughout the synthesis process.24 For instance, increased Zn content decreases the relative atomic Cu/Zn ratio, leading to Cu-poor and Zn-rich conditions. As a result, it favors Zn atom substitution at Cu sites (i.e., ZnCu), eventually creating high concentration anti-site ZnCu defects and A-type defect clusters with VCu.24 Moreover, increasing the Zn content increases the Zn/Sn ratio, which may favor the substitution of Sn sites by Zn, resulting in ZnSn anti-site defects and related B-type defect clusters (i.e., [2ZnCu + ZnSn]).
According to the Raman analysis theory, the Raman peaks are derived from the A, B, and E modes at (i) 171 cm−1 (A and B modes) and (ii) 233 and 245 cm−1 (B and E modes).21,22 Raman peaks are not expected to have changed with the cationic disorder from compositional variations because the A1 modes correspond to solely Se vibrations. Simultaneously, it can be seen that the B and E modes correspond to the Cu/Zn and Cu/Sn atomic plane vibrations.21 Raman peaks at 171 cm−1 are expected to increase in intensity and area with the decreasing concentration of VCu and A-type defect clusters for the decreased number of Cu/Zn and Cu/Sn vibration units. Similarly, the decrease in the intensity and area of Raman peaks at 233 cm−1 is expected when (i) Cu/Zn and Cu/Sn related defects like CuZn, SnZn, ZnCu, ZnSn defects and their corresponding B- and C-type [2CuZn + SnZn] defect clusters and, (ii) defects of ZnCu and ZnSn and B-type defect clusters from Raman peak at 245 cm−1 increase. Additionally, an increase in the concentration of anti-site defect ZnCu could increase the number of Zn–Se bonds, indicating the formation of ZnSe-like contributions to the Raman peak at 250 cm−1.21
The change in relative peak intensities and area was evaluated to confirm anti-site defects and related defect clusters in the samples. All spectra were initially normalized in A1 mode (196 cm−1) to analyze the defects and related defect clusters using the difference in peak intensities with B modes (Fig. 1(a) and (b)). Then, the deconvoluted spectra were obtained by fitting the Raman peaks with the Lorentzian function, as shown in Fig. S4 and S5.†
 Fig. 1  Normalized Raman spectra of the samples of (a) A and (b) B series at room temperature. The change in the A-type and B-type defect cluster concentration is represented with colored arrows in each figure. The symbol ‘●’ located at 185 cm−1 indicates signals from SnSe2. For clarity, all spectra are normalized to the Raman peak at 196 cm−1. The relative peak area ratios at 171 cm−1 (□), 233 cm−1 (○) and 245 cm−1 (△) for samples from the A series at (c) 171 cm−1/(171 cm−1 + 196 cm−1), (e) 233 cm−1/(233 cm−1 + 196 cm−1) and (g) 245 cm−1/(245 cm−1 + 196 cm−1) and samples from the B series at (d) 171 cm−1/(196 cm−1 + 171 cm−1), (f) 233 cm−1/(233 cm−1 + 196 cm−1) and (h) 245 cm−1/(245 cm−1 + 196 cm−1), respectively. 

Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the normalized Raman spectra in A1 mode, and (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h) show the relative Raman peak areas calculated for the 171 cm−1 (□), 233 cm−1 (○) and 245 cm−1 (△) peaks with respect to the A1 modes from the A and B series samples, respectively. With the increasing Zn content, the value of full width at half maximum (FWHM) for the main Raman peaks at 196 cm−1 increased from 10 to 13 cm−1, which might be attributed to phonon confinements.20 This trend implies that the crystal quality of CZTSSe thin films deteriorates with the increasing Zn content, and it could potentially be caused by an increase in the anti-site defect concentration.15,17,18 The positions of Raman peaks located at 171 cm−1 do shift towards slightly higher frequency modes, indicating the change of several modes sensitive to Cu vibrations (i.e., ZnCu and VCu).15,21 However, their intensities do not change considerably when the Zn content increases. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the area of the Raman peak at 171 cm−1 linearly increased with the increasing Zn content, implying a small decrease in the concentration of the VCu defect and related A-type defect clusters.22 With the increasing Zn content, the positions of the Raman peaks at 233 cm−1 shifted towards higher frequency modes, while intensities decreased. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1(e), the area of the Raman peak at 233 cm−1 linearly increases with the increasing Zn content, suggesting that Cu/Zn and associated defects as well as B- and C-type defect clusters may increase with the increasing Zn content. Based on the compositional ratio of the A series samples (see Table S3†), the formation of CuZn and SnZn defects and related C-type defect clusters is difficult under Zn-rich conditions.21,24,39 This clearly suggests that only defects such as ZnCu, ZnSn and related B-type defect clusters increase when the Zn content increases. Under similar conditions, the position of the Raman peaks at 245 cm−1 shifts towards higher frequency modes, and their intensities increase. The area of Raman peaks, on the other hand, does not change significantly with the variation of the Zn content, as shown in Fig. 1(g). This trend may imply that (i) the enhanced Raman peaks are attributed to the minor ZnSe phase on CZTSSe surfaces; (ii) the concentration of defects of ZnCu and ZnSn and related B-type defect clusters do not change with the increasing Zn content from the Raman peak at 245 cm−1. Based on the Raman peaks analysis for the A series samples, it can be speculated that as the Zn content increases, the concentration of VCu and A-type defect clusters decreases, whereas that of the ZnSn and ZnCu defects and related B-type defect clusters increases.
With varied Cu contents, there is a distinct change in relative peak intensities at 171 cm−1 observed, as shown in Fig. 1(b); the Raman peak intensities increase with the increasing Cu content at 171 cm−1. The decreasing Cu content leads the Cu/Zn ratio to decrease, resulting in similar Cu-poor and Zn-rich conditions that easily form a high concentration of ZnCu anti-site defects and A-type defect clusters. The decrease in the Raman peak area with the decreasing Cu content reflects the increased concentration of VCu and thus the concentration of the A-type defect clusters. Fig. 1(d) shows the increased peak areas at 171 cm−1, revealing a reduced concentration of the A-type defect clusters as the Cu content increases. The areas of the peak at 233 cm−1 decreased, as seen in Fig. 1(f), while those at 245 cm−1 remained constant (Fig. 1(h)). The Raman peak area describing the defects of ZnCu and ZnSn and related B-type defect cluster concentration is reduced because there is less probability of ZnCu defect formation with a high Cu content.21,24,39 The A-type defect clusters, including VCu, are less influenced by the Zn content (if Zn/Sn > 1), whereas a change in the Cu content has a greater effect. Even if the Zn/Sn ratio in the B series samples is relatively constant, decreased overall Cu/Sn ratios (see Table S3†) under Cu-poor and Sn-rich conditions generate an increased probability of SnCu defect formation due to the Sn atom substitution at Cu sites.21,24,39 Dimitrievska et al.21 demonstrated that the existence of SnZn point defects results in an additional SnSe-like contribution near 185 cm−1 and the conversion of B modes near ∼250 cm−1 to E modes near ∼230 cm−1. As a result, as shown in Fig. 1(b), as the Cu content increases, the peak intensity near 185 cm−1 and 233 cm−1 decreases, revealing the reduced concentration of Sn-related substitutional defects (i.e., SnZn or SnCu). Although the formation energies for individual Sn substitutional defects remain high, the possibility of relatively deep level defects such as SnZn and CuZn exists due to the comparatively low formation energy of C-type defect clusters.40 Thus, the observed opposite trend at 245 cm−1 could be influenced by SnCu and CuZn defect concentrations. Moreover, the formation of SnSe2 in samples B1 and B2 was confirmed by peaks around 185 cm−1.
3.3 Defects and defect clusters on device performances

Fig. 2 and Table 1 show the average device performance and best cell parameters with A and B series samples prepared with increasing Zn and Cu contents, respectively. Fig. S6(c) and (d)† show the external quantum efficiency (EQE) plots for the best device performances in the A and B series in the ESI.† As can be seen in Fig. 2(a) and (e), as the Zn content of the samples increases from A1 to A4, the average Voc and fill factor (FF) of the device decrease drastically from 487 to 429 mV and 0.62 to 0.48, respectively. At the same time, the average short circuit current density (Jsc) of the device remained nearly constant, at around 32 to 33 mA cm−2 (Fig. 2(c)). With the increasing Zn content, the average device performance decreased dramatically from 9.69 to 6.74% (Fig. 2(g)). For the A series samples, the EQE spectra (Fig. S6(a)†) of CZTSSe solar cell devices are over 70% in the visible region, decreasing up to sample A3 and then increasing for sample A4, following the measured Jsc trend. The EQE spectra decrease with increasing wavelengths, which is a common behavior in kesterite-based solar cells. Interestingly, regardless of the Zn content, the tail positions of EQE spectra do not significantly change, and the estimated Urbach energy (Eu) values for A series samples were found to be similar ∼39–41 meV as shown in Fig. S6(e)† and Table 2.

The best cell among the A series samples (sample A1) showed power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 10% with a Voc of around 487 mV, whilst sample A4 shows the lowest PCE and Voc of 8.32% and 437 mV, respectively. The severe drop in Voc and FF may be ascribed to the formation of the high concentrations of ZnCu and ZnSn defects and related B-type defect clusters, as well as the reduced concentration of VCu and related A-type defect clusters with the increasing Zn content. Recently some of the studies unveiled that the ZnCu anti-site defects are benign in terms of device performance.41,42 However, it should be noted that, with an increase in the Zn content, the probability of formation of the Zn substitutional defects increases at higher Zn concentrations, including the deep level ZnSn and shallow level ZnCu anti-site. Basically, the substitution of Zn on the Cu site (ZnCu) results in an ionized positive charge and makes them shallow donors.43 So, even if the ZnCu defect has a shallow level and is benign within the optimum concentration limit, it's higher concentration may cause the accumulation of defects near the conduction band edge and sort of the electron sink.43,44 It has been noticed that a high concentration of ZnCu donors increases the electrostatic potential fluctuation and gives rise to band bending.45 Besides, potential fluctuation induces an electron trapping effect, resulting in electron localization in kesterite.46 Consequently, the potential threat of ZnCu donors over the optimal limit causes the electron sink/electron localization facilitated carrier recombination and induces Voc loss under Zn rich conditions, as seen in our sample A4. Thus, although a higher Zn content has minimal impact on VCu formation, the formation of a high concentration of ZnCu anti-site defects enhances shallow donor level facilitated carrier recombination, leading to severe Voc loss in the device.43 Furthermore, A-type defect clusters are benign in terms of device performance, whereas high concentrations of ZnCu and ZnSn defects are also vulnerable to device performance at a high Zn content. The concentration of B-type defect clusters increased from samples A1 to A4, and hence they corroborate well with the gradual Voc loss in the A series samples. To reveal large Voc loss behavior, the electrical properties of the device, such as minority carrier lifetime (τ), diode ideality factor (A), saturation current density (J0), carrier concentration (Na) and depletion width (Wd), were calculated for A series samples and are tabulated in Table 2. The τ determined from the PL spectra with bimodal exponential peak fit shows that sample A1 exhibits the highest τ of 3.79 ns (Fig. S6(a) and (b)†). At the same time, it decreases considerably when the Zn content increases up to A3, and then it slightly increases. The lifetime value for sample A4 with the highest Zn content is nearly four times lower, which is around 0.92 ns. Furthermore, in Table 2, the A and J0 values calculated for the best cell from samples A1 to A4 show a similar trend. Sample A1 exhibits the lowest A value of 1.72 and J0 value of 0.54 × 10−6 mA cm−2, whereas the rest of the samples exhibit high A (>2) and J0 values (∼6 × 10−6 mA cm−2) except for sample A4. The lower τ, higher A (>2), and one order higher J0 values in samples A2 and A3 represent the dominant SRH carrier recombination on the CZTSSe surface, which is assisted by the deep-level defects and related defect clusters in the depletion region. Moreover, the values of Wd and Na also exhibit comparable behavior to diode parameters from capacitance (C) vs. voltage (V) characterization studies as shown in Table 2, Fig. S7(a) and (b).† With an increase in the Zn content, samples A2 and A3 show the lowest Wd values among all prepared samples, which get slightly improved for sample A4. Previous studies revealed that the Wd value is a key parameter in determining charge separation and collection as well as influencing the conductivity of solar cells.47,48 A wider Wd is beneficial for collecting the photogenerated charge carriers in the long wavelength region near the band edge. This may also lead to reduced interface recombination or tunneling recombination, resulting in improved Na values in kesterite-based solar cells. The A series samples shown in Table 2 show that the Wd and Na value trends are well matched with average Jsc values. Compared to samples A2 and A3, a relatively wider Wd observed for sample A4 may indicate a relatively low concentration of CuZn and ZnSn defects. The origin of this unexpected behavior for defects and defect clusters in sample A4 is unknown. Though, one possible explanation is that the formation of the ZnSe phase on the CZTSSe surface may be reduced in sample A4. Raman spectroscopy is typically a surface-sensitive technique with a shallow penetration depth (∼100 nm), and a minor ZnSe phase may be detectable on the CZTSSe surface. The Raman spectra of the A series samples fitted with the Lorentzian function shown in Fig. S4† suggest that the intensities of the Raman peaks near 250 cm−1 in sample A1 decreased compared to samples A2 and A3, indicating a reduction in the formation of ZnSe phase on the CZTSSe surface and the formation of defects and related defect clusters. Several earlier investigations have demonstrated that the unavoidable formation of ZnSe phases on the CZTSSe surface might result in a high recombination rate in the junction region, implying a lower Jsc in kesterite solar cells.49–52
The influence of different Cu contents on device performance was also investigated, and the average device performance for the B series samples is shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. Despite the fact that all of the samples prepared had a different Cu content, the average Voc remained nearly constant and Jsc increased with the increasing Cu content (Fig. 2(b) and (d)). The average Voc of the device remained constant at ∼455 mV and the average Jsc increased from 29.6 mA cm−2 (sample B1) to 32.3 mA cm−2 (sample B4), respectively. The EQE spectra of CZTSSe solar cells for B series samples (Fig. S6(d)†) show a similar shape; however, the tail positions for EQE spectra were shifted towards long wavelengths as the Cu content increased. On the other hand, the estimated Urbach energy (Eu) values for B series samples were found to be similar values ranging from 40–45 meV, unlike the tail position shifting for EQE plots. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 2(f), the average FF of the device increased from 0.52 (sample B1) to 0.57 (sample B3) with the increasing Cu content and decreased to 0.50 at a higher Cu content for sample B4, resulting in a similar trend in average device performance (Fig. 2(h)). The average PCE of devices increased from 7.08 to 8.24%, then decreased to 7.45% for sample B4. Because an increased Cu content suppresses the concentration of A-type defect clusters, the existence of high concentrations of A-type defect clusters or shallow acceptor levels besides secondary phases like SnSe2 (Fig. 1(b) and (d)) may result in high interface assisted carrier recombination and thus reduced PCE at a relatively low Cu content. The increase in average Jsc values for B series samples can be attributed to a reduced recombination rate near the junction region, which is caused by the reduced defect concentrations of VCu, ZnCu, ZnSn and related A- and B-type defect clusters, as shown in Fig. 1(d), (f) and (h). Furthermore, A-type defect clusters lower the carrier mobility, reducing the device performance at a lower Cu content (i.e., sample B1).53,54 Except for sample B4, the device performances demonstrate an opposite trend compared to previous studies with a varying Cu content.22 It could be attributed to a relatively narrow compositional ratio of Cu-poor (Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.58–0.71) and Zn-rich (Zn/Sn = ∼1.1) under our experimental conditions. Our earlier reports revealed that the device shows a PCE of over 9% at Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.58–0.65, and it decreases drastically over Cu/(Zn + Sn) of Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.7 (i.e., it is a similar compositional condition with sample B4).9,32,33 Among B series samples, sample B1 exhibits the lowest τ value of ∼1.02 ns, which increases further with the increasing Cu content (Fig. S6(b)†). Sample B2 shows a relatively higher τ value of 2.84 ns, whereas sample B3 with high device performance shows a value of 1.32 ns. The CuZn defect has a relatively deeper energy level than the VCu, hence even with an adequate concentration of defects and Na, undesired carrier recombination reduces the carrier lifetime in sample B3. Table 2 summarizes the A and J0 values analyzed for the best cell from B series samples. Sample B3, which demonstrates high device performance, has the lowest A and J0 values of 1.90 and 2.55 × 10−6 mA cm−2, respectively. The samples B1, B2, and B4, on the other hand, have A larger than 2 with J0 values of over 1.0 × 10−5 mA cm−2. These poor diode parameters confirm the high nonradiative carrier recombination losses and high recombination centers among B series samples. In comparison to other samples, sample B3 with an optimum Cu content shows a relatively larger Wd of 59 nm and the lowest Na, about 4.7 × 1016 cm−3. Sample B4 with the highest Cu content shows the lowest Wd and highest Na of 40 nm and 1.31 × 1017 cm−3. The concentration of shallow accepter defects, in general, defines the improving p-type conductivity or high majority carrier (i.e., hole) concentrations in the p-type absorber. Based on Raman analysis of B series samples, the better values of Wd and Na of sample B4 are attributed to the decreased concentration of VCu, CuZn, and ZnSn as well as A- and B-type defect clusters shown in Fig. 1(b), (f), and (h). The shortened Wd hampers the efficacy of the carrier separation process, resulting in poor device performance. It has been shown that Na increases more rapidly and the Wd shrinks when Zn/Sn >1.0.48 Therefore, the A series samples exhibit higher Na and shorter Wd than those from the B series (Table 2, Fig. S7(c) and (d)†) for their relatively higher Zn/Sn ratio compared to B series as shown in Table S3.† This increased Na moves the quasi-Fermi level of holes near the valence band energy. The improved carrier separation process improves Voc, which explains why samples from the A series exhibit a relatively higher Voc than those from the B series. However, it should be noted that too much short Wd also enhances the probability of tunneled charge carrier transport and carrier recombination processes, lowering the Voc and Jsc in the device.
3.4 Band tailing analysis
To understand the relationship between the Voc-deficit caused by band tail characteristics and the cationic disordering-based defects (i.e., ZnCu and ZnSn) and related defect clusters (i.e., A and B-types), we compared the energy differences between the effective Eg measured from the inflection of EQE spectra, i.e., the peak in dEQE/dλ and the Eg measured from RTPL spectra as shown in Fig. 3 and Table 2. Fig. S6(c) and (d)† show the corresponding EQE spectra. Except for sample A2, the other samples exhibit an Eg value of ∼1.010 eV as determined from PL spectra. In contrast, the A series samples show an Eg value of ∼1.050 eV determined from EQE spectra as depicted in Fig. 3(a), (c), (e), (g) and Table 2. Sample A1 with the highest device performance shows the lowest energy difference of 34 meV, while samples A3 and A4 show 42 and 40 meV, respectively. However, sample A2 shows the largest energy difference of 57 meV; therefore, the dramatic decrease in device performance along with an average Voc drop of nearly 60 mV can be explained by the poor band tailing characteristic in sample A2. Except for sample A1, the worse band tailing characteristic in samples A2-A4 can be attributed to the compositional fluctuation from cationic disordering (i.e., the increase in ZnCu and ZnSn defects and related B-type defect clusters) with an increasing Zn content.24 Even though their Eg values from EQE spectra are similar (∼1.050 eV), the poor band tailing characteristic in sample A2 can be attributed to the relatively narrow Eg (∼0.989 eV) seen from the PL spectrum. This unique behavior can also be attributed to the significantly high Cu/Sn compositional ratio for sample A2 given in Table S3,† implying the formation of relatively high concentrations of VSn and ZnSn defects and B-type defect clusters resulting in a relatively narrow Eg from the PL spectrum.55 With the increasing Zn content from samples A1 to A4, the Voc-deficit calculated for the corresponding A series samples also increased from 561 (A1) to 616 mV (A4), respectively. This Voc-deficit behavior can be ascribed to an increase in the concentration of ZnSn and ZnCu defects and related B-type defect clusters with an increased Zn content. This increase in defects and defect clusters may introduce nonradiative recombination centers, resulting in large Voc-deficit characteristics. For B series samples, Eg values from both spectra were found to be decreased with the increasing Cu content, as shown in Fig. 3(b), (d), (f), (h) and Table 2. The high concentration of VCu and ZnCu defects and related A-type defect clusters theoretically assists in the downshifting of Ev and upshifting of the conduction band (Ec), resulting in the enlargement of the Eg values, which is well-matched with the trend of Eg values and Raman analysis.55–57 It is also observed that the energy difference between Eg values from both spectra shows similar values (∼40 meV). The Voc-deficit in B series samples decreases with the Cu content, which corresponds to the trend of decreasing defects and related defect clusters as shown in Fig. 1(d), (f), and (h).

Each dEQE/dλ graph was obtained from Gaussian fits using Origin software. 
3.5 Relationship between defects, defect clusters and device performances
Our Raman analysis suggested that the change in relative areas of the Raman peaks at 171, 233, and 245 cm−1 can be used to access the presence of specific defects and related defect clusters. Fig. 4 shows the relationship between the relative Raman peak areas and device performances, including Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE in CZTSSe solar cells. In the device performances, all maximum values for Raman peak areas at 171, 233, and 245 cm−1 are 0.20, 0.023, and 0.064, respectively, except for Jsc. The values of Jsc for each Raman peak area are slightly shifted towards a larger value at 171 and 233 cm−1, while those at 245 cm−1 are slightly shifted towards a smaller value. Our Raman analysis corroborates well with previous studies demonstrating that the Raman peak area at 171 cm−1 is strongly related to the concentration of VCu point defects and ZnCu anti-site defects in CZTSSe thin films (Fig. 4(a)). The point defect of VCu is commonly regarded as a shallow acceptor and hole generator, whereas ZnCu is a shallow level donor and recombination center.24,43 According to this theoretical defect information for the kesterite crystal structure, the maximum PCE can only be observed with an optimum concentration of the VCu and ZnCu defects and related A-type defect clusters. The higher value for the Raman peak area at 171 cm−1 compared to 0.20 revealed that the high concentration of defects may reduce carrier mobility and increase recombination centers, resulting in poor device performance. On the other hand, the lower value of the Raman peak at 171 cm−1 compared to 0.20 suggested lower Na, leading to inferior device performances. Fig. 4(b) shows that increasing the Raman peak area at 233 cm−1 decreases device performances except for Jsc values. In our case, Raman analysis indicated that the peak at 233 cm−1 is strongly related to ZnCu and ZnSn defects and related B-type defect clusters. They act as shallow acceptors, deep level donors, and recombination centers, resulting in reduced device performance with the increasing the Raman peak area at 233 cm−1.41–44 Furthermore, it shows similar behavior to those at 171 cm−1, resulting in maximum device performances, expect Jsc values, for Raman peak area at 245 cm−1 of 0.064 (Fig. 4(c)). In the case of Jsc, the concentration of defects decreases as the Raman peak area at 245 cm−1 increases, which is attributed to an increase in ZnCu and ZnSn defects and related B-type defect clusters (shown in Raman analysis). The modest fluctuations in maximum Jsc values in each Raman peak area can be attributed to the inconsistency in increasing each defect concentration at the kesterite surface. According to first-principles calculations, these defects should induce a small increase in Eg by shifting Ev and Ec band edges.58

3.6 Best device performance
Our experimental results and discussion of defects and related defect clusters from Raman analysis may imply the key factor of engineering defect and defect cluster concentrations for fabricating high efficiency kesterite solar cells. Based on this methodology, we optimized the CZTSSe absorber thin films around optimum Raman peak area values by precisely adjusting the compositional ratio with Cu/(Zn + Sn) = ∼0.60 and Zn/Sn = ∼1.10. The resulting champion CZTSSe solar cell showed Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE of 498 mV, 36.79 mA cm−2, 0.61 and 11.23%, respectively, as illustrated in Fig. 5(a). The EQE spectrum of the CZTSSe solar cell with champion efficiency is over 80% in the visible region and decreases in the longer wavelength region (Fig. 5(b)). The EQE spectrum decreased steadily from 600 to 1300 nm, indicating that it may be attributed to smaller grains near the back contact side of the solar cell, which could act as recombination centers and eventually lead to limited carrier collection in the longer wavelength region. The Voc-deficit and energy difference values calculated for champion CZTSSe solar cells are 560 mV and 37 meV, respectively (Fig. S8†). They are better than those prepared with the A and B series samples.

Although the present work reveals correlations between point defects and related A and B-type defect clusters, band tailing characteristics, and device performances through detailed Raman analysis, the device still shows a relatively high Voc-deficit, and a relatively larger energy difference between Eg, determined from RTPL and dEQE/dλ plots (i.e., poor band tailing characteristics) than the current best kesterite- and CIGS-based devices.4,59,60 Further research into (i) the fine-tuning of compositional ratios to suppress defects and related defect clusters (ZnCu and ZnSn defects and related B-type defect clusters) that act as recombination centers in the kesterite and (ii) additional analysis for each defect concentration and correlation with device performance using temperature dependence admittance spectroscopy could reveal more information.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we investigated the defects, related defect clusters, and band tailing characteristics in CZTSSe thin films through detailed Raman analysis and their impact on device performances. With different compositional ratios, the appearance of the morphology and crystal structure of all CZTSSe thin films did not change significantly; however, Raman peaks, the concentration of defect clusters, band tailing characteristics, and device performances were significantly changed. Although the analyzed defect clusters (A, B, and C-type) are charge compensated, the individual defects such as the ZnCu and SnCu defects, are key factors influencing device performance. In particular, we found that the higher Zn content has a minimal impact on VCu formation; however, ZnCu donors over the optimal concentration cause the electron sink/electron localization to facilitate carrier recombination and induce Voc loss in the device. Further, the relative change in Jsc and band tailing characteristics does not correspond well to defect-related trends. This inconsistency is attributed to the unavoidable minor ZnSe and SnSe2 secondary phases on the kesterite surface. This study reveals that precise control of ZnCu anti-site defects and minor secondary phases on kesterite surfaces is necessary for fabricating highly efficient kesterite solar cells in the future.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Normalized Raman spectra of the samples of (a) A and (b) B series at room temperature. The change in the A-type and B-type defect cluster concentration is represented with colored arrows in each figure. The symbol ‘●’ located at 185 cm−1 indicates signals from SnSe2. For clarity, all spectra are normalized to the Raman peak at 196 cm−1. The relative peak area ratios at 171 cm−1 (□), 233 cm−1 (○) and 245 cm−1 (△) for samples from the A series at (c) 171 cm−1/(171 cm−1 + 196 cm−1), (e) 233 cm−1/(233 cm−1 + 196 cm−1) and (g) 245 cm−1/(245 cm−1 + 196 cm−1) and samples from the B series at (d) 171 cm−1/(196 cm−1 + 171 cm−1), (f) 233 cm−1/(233 cm−1 + 196 cm−1) and (h) 245 cm−1/(245 cm−1 + 196 cm−1), respectively.	 

 	Fig. 2  Device performance of the CZTSSe solar cells for samples A1 to A4: (a) Voc, (c) Jsc, (e) FF, and (g) efficiency and for B1 to B4: (b) Voc, (d) Jsc, (f) FF, and (h) efficiency, respectively measured under AM 1.5 G illumination conditions. Each data set was obtained from 4–6 solar cells. The average and best performances for samples are provided in Table 1 with a device area of 0.3 cm2.
