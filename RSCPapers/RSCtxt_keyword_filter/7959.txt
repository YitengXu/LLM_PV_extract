    , Accepted 5th October 2022First published on 5th October 2022AbstractA clear selection rule for the third component is the premise for improving the efficiency of ternary organic solar cells (T-OSCs), which is also the top priority for clarifying the working mechanism. Here, the concept of structural domains is borrowed to mark molecular characteristics, quantify structural information, and support the breakthrough of structural dimensions layer by layer to confirm whether the same/different structural domain and ratio will lead to essential changes in the role of the third component. It shows that the domain difference determines the effect degree of the ratio on the morphology, stacking site and interfacial arrangement from the cluster level to the electron state level. Furthermore, under a certain domain difference, the ratio can react in turn to regulate the internal charge transfer (CT) mode. We aim to establish the corresponding relationship between the selection of the third component and the CT mechanism, and reveal the essence of a trace amount of the third component in the photoelectric conversion process, providing a theoretical basis for the targeted selection of the third component for T-OSCs.
Introduction
Thanks to material innovation and device engineering, organic solar cells (OSCs) as a potential renewable energy technology have good development prospects.1 Currently, OSCs still have lower device efficiency than inorganic and perovskite solar cells, which poses a challenge to their further development and widespread application.2 Among the ways to improve power conversion efficiency (PCE), the ternary strategy has aroused great interest, which is easy to perform for large-scale production.3,4 Introducing a third component with complementary absorption could expand the absorption of ternary organic solar cells (T-OSCs), while keeping the single active layer and reducing the production difficulty.5 Designing the third component reasonably makes it play a positive role in affecting PCE,6 including tuning the energy level by controlling the ratio of the third component,7 forming a cascade energy level arrangement to accelerate charge transfer (CT),8 broadening the absorption spectrum by capturing photons to increase the exciton dissociation rate,9,10 balancing charge transmission by a reduced density of trap states,11 and modulating the morphology of the active layer.12 Above all, it is possible to increase the open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current simultaneously and improve the fill factor.
T-OSCs could combine the advantages of a simple configuration and low-cost processing of binary devices perfectly, inherit the characteristics of tandem cells and promote the photovoltaic parameters that determine PCE simultaneously.13,14 Recently, the PCEs of T-OSCs have increased more than 19%.15–18 Hou's group selected nonfullerene F-BTA3 as the third component (a guest acceptor) according to the absorption defect of original binary combination at 600–750 nm to construct T-OSCs, which increases PCE to 19.0%.19 On the another hand, Wang et al. incorporated an asymmetric symmetric acceptor of Y6-1O with a chemical skeleton similar to that of Y7-BO into T-OSCs, which formed an alloy-like state due to good compatibility and obtained a PCE of 18%.20 It is worth noting that both the ratio and properties of the third component are different in the two devices, and regardless of whether the third component is the guest acceptor or guest donor and whether it is structurally similar or not, the PCE can be significantly improved.
This phenomenon caught our attention where we have found that the effects of different roles played by materials vary greatly, possibly depending on the ratio and structural characteristics, which in turn influence morphologic regions and CT paths. For example in all-small-molecule devices, Wei's group has successively produced DR3TBDTT:DR3TBDTT-E:PC71BM21 and DR3TBDTT:DR3TBDTT-S-E:PC71BM.22 Conjugated small molecules of 10% DR3TBDTT-E and 5% DR3TBDTT-S-E with rigid backbones were introduced as the third component respectively, which could act as a charge relay to achieve an efficient CT process,3 obtaining PCEs of 10.26% and 10.38% respectively, which already belong to the series with the highest efficiency among all-small-molecule devices in recent years. SMPV1 with a similar skeleton of the main backbone was introduced into P3HT:PC71BM as the third component, which also formed a cascaded energy level structure, but the final PCE was only 4.06%.23 Behind such a contrasting PCE, interestingly, if the side chains on main skeleton are all substituted by methyl groups, SMPV1 has a nearly identical molecular skeleton to DR3TBDTT and/or DR3TBDTT-E (DR3TBDTT-S-E), and also could form strong π–π interactions, which could interact and blend with the host donor and PC71BM. However, in our previous work, it was proved that the related mechanisms in the P3HT:SMPV1:PC71BM and DR3TBDTT:DR3TBDTT-E:PC71BM systems are different.24
It is foreseeable that there are many screening criteria for the third component to improve PCE,25–28 since the third component involved in different photophysical processes.29,30 However, with the development of PCE, various mechanisms that can coexist in T-OSCs have been derived from the perspective of energetics and thermodynamics, which means that the introduction of the third component complicates the microstructure of T-OSCs, making it difficult to improve PCE. Furthermore, due to the complicated mechanism, the mapping relationship between it and the structure has not yet presented a clear framework. So the methods to improve the efficiency of binary OSCs are still used for T-OSCs, including updating the material structure,31 optimizing experimental conditions,32 trying different combinations of three materials,33 and changing the third component ratio.34 It leads to difficulty in carrying out targeted design based on the characteristics of the micro-mechanism, making it quite challenging to clarify the mechanism and improve performance.
Considering the functionality and participation of the third component in photoelectric conversion,2,35,36 it is vital to identify the characteristics based on the structural information presented by the material to form a framework of structural domain-operating principles to maximize the advantages of the material.37–39 The selection of the third component is the key problem to construct high-efficiency T-OSCs. However, the relevant work in this area is not much, and the scientific role of the mechanism should be mentioned and paid attention to. Therefore, here continues the in-depth study of the operating mechanism of T-OSCs with the ultimate goal to establish a general rule for selecting the third component that exactly matches the main component. We propose that it is the primary solution to solve the core problem to determine the influence range and adjustment mode of the ratio and structural characteristics by quantum chemical calculations combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
Theoretical method
Research models
DR3TBDTT40–42 named DT, with the side chain removed, is the main donor and PC71BM is the acceptor. The two third components are shown in Fig. 1, DTE (de-side-chained DR3TBDTT-E) with the same backbone of DT, and P3HT simplified as twelve thiophene units. DTE is a rigid planar molecular structure, but P3HT is a flexible long-chain one (the selection of the model is placed in Section S1 of the ESI†).

Using the terminal group, the thiophene π-bridge and central group of DT as the classification criteria of structural domains; 60% difference indicates a 60% difference between DT and P3HT in the two terminal and central domains, and 5% difference indicates a 5% difference in the substituents of the BDT side chain between DT and DTE. 
Considering the concept of the domain and its influencing factors, the blending ratio of the donor and the third component was further interchanged to investigate the effect of the ratio, obtaining in four blends: DT:DTE:PC71BM (0.9:0.1:1), DT:DTE:PC71BM (0.1:0.9:1), DT:P3HT:PC71BM (0.9:0.1:1) and DT:P3HT:PC71BM (0.1:0.9:1), where a doping level of 10% corresponds to ten. For the convenience of clear comparison, each system in the following discussion will be simplified as DT:DTE(0.1):PC71BM, DT:DTE(0.9):PC71BM, DT:P3HT(0.1):PC71BM and DT:P3HT(0.9):PC71BM.
Conceptualization of molecular structural domains
According to the symmetric structure of the DT backbone, there are three kinds of structural domains: two terminal group domains, two thiophene π-bridge domains and a central domain (five parts in total), corresponding to RHD, T and BDT respectively. If the differences between the three molecular domains could be numerically quantified, there is only a 5% difference on the half of the side chains of BDT between DT and DTE. Based on this classification of domains, the difference between DT and P3HT is 60% with differences in two terminal and central domains.
Computational methods
The molecular structures of monomers were optimized with the PBE0/6-31G(d,p) level,43,44 and the ternary blends were optimized using CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) with D3 dispersion to characterize the long-range CT excitation properties.45,46 All density functional theory calculations were performed in the Gaussian 09 program package.47 MD simulations were used to visualize the unoccupied regions under the microscopic topography of the blends.48,49 In order to compare the influence of the similarity and ratio, other binary blends are introduced as shown in Fig. S1,† and it can be clearly seen that the four ternary systems have a certain sparse area (yellow filling range), and the spatial area is similar. See Section S2 of the ESI† for specific simulation details.50
Results and discussion
Charge transfer paths influenced by domain differences and ratios in blends
As we all know, “structures determine properties” and “quantitative changes lead to qualitative changes”. Therefore, in the face of a domain change of 5% → 60% and a ratio change of 10% → 90%, the internal CT path was excavated as the first step to explore the mechanism and the influencing factors, which is the key to identifying the CT mechanism. Beginning with the contribution of fragments to electrons and holes, the Gaussian fitting method was used to judge the intermolecular CT trend to predict the transfer path. Fig. 2 shows the average value of the net transfer amount of ternary blends under each path. If the charge amount corresponding to the highest peak (X axis) is the largest, it means that this path plays a major role in transfer, and a large half-peak width indicates similar charge amounts in this range. Fig. S2† shows the scatter-like distribution of the amount of charge under each path. The smaller the slope formed (the angle off the Y axis), the greater the probability that the CT path exists, which was elaborated in the caption of Fig. S2.†
 Fig. 2  Gaussian fits of calculated the total charge transfer counts based on the distribution of the calculated excited state. The figure shows a Gaussian curve fitted according to the bar graph: the X axis and Y axis represent the amount of net charge transfer between molecules (|e|) and the number of occurrences of each CT amount respectively. It shows the fitted curve graph of the number of occurrences of each net CT value (Y-axis, counts) as a function of the net CT amount (X-axis, |e|). Color code: purple indicates the D1 → A path, orange indicates the D2 → A path, and green indicates the D1 → D2 path. 
From the average value of the CT count, the dominant path in DT:DTE(0.1):PC71BM is D1 → A. With the increase of the amount of DTE introduced, D2 → A and D1 → A coexisted in DT:DTE(0.9):PC71BM. This indicates that for a similar skeleton with only a 5% domain difference, the ratio has a great effect, and the contribution of DT as the host donor to the transfer process mainly depends on the ratio. In contrast, the dominant ones are both D2 → A in DT:P3HT(0.1):PC71BM and DT:P3HT(0.9):PC71BM, indicating that the influence of the ratio is very small without similar skeletons. The main reason is that P3HT itself can be directly excited to complete the process of excitation → exciton generation → exciton dissociation to the donor/acceptor (D/A) interface. In addition, P3HT, DT and PC71BM could form a gradient distribution of energy levels in turn.24 Therefore, we speculate that P3HT with relatively strong electron-giving characteristics is more suitable as the host donor in the DT:P3HT:PC71BM, where a small amount of DT needs to be added, that is DT:P3HT(0.9):PC71BM. Meanwhile in DT:DTE:PC71BM, DTE is more suitable as a guest donor obtaining DT:DTE(0.1):PC71BM due to the introduction of ester groups with a larger steric hindrance. It is worth noting that there is a small CT amount between the donor and the third component in the four systems. Bur differently in transfer orientation, D1 → D2 is in the two systems with similar skeletons, and D2 → D1 is in the systems with dissimilar skeletons. It reflects that P3HT can transfer electrons/transport holes to DT.
From the perspective of the existence probability of the CT path, the probability of occurrence of DT:DTE(0.1):PC71BM is D1 → A > D2 → A > D1 → D2 and DT:DTE(0.9):PC71BM is D2 → A > D1 → A > D1 → D2 (Fig. 3), which indicates that the ratio determines the CT mechanism in the systems with similar skeletons. But in DT:P3HT(0.1):PC71BM and DT:P3HT(0.9):PC71BM with dissimilar skeletons, they are D2 → A > D1 → A > D2 → D1, and the CT mechanism is the same and not affected by the ratio. It reminds us that there should be a functional relationship between domain differences and the optimal ratio between host and guest donors. However, whether the role between the two is directional and what are the respective influencing factors and scope are not yet determined, but it is worth exploring because it affects and even determines the overall CT path. It should be explored layer by layer along the changes of characteristic dimensions with cluster level → molecular level → electron level of the research object.

Free volume of space obtained by molecular dynamics
In order to quantify the space volume and ensure the reliability of the results, the free volume was calculated by taking the last 5 ns of the simulated equilibrium phase process, which represents the regions of the simulated MD box not occupied by atoms. Based on DT:PC71BM binary blends, due to the steric hindrance of the ester group of DTE, the free volume DTE:PC71BM is a smaller than that of DT:PC71BM. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 4, introducing 10% DTE and P3HT could obtain different trends. Since the structure of the former is relatively difficult to distort, the free volume tends to decrease, which indicates that the spatial distribution of DT:DTE(0.1):PC71BM is more uniform to increase the phase separation size appropriately. Relatively, the free volume of the latter is increased, because the flexible structure of P3HT allows it to fold or distort in any form with intermolecular interaction. Therefore, P3HT occupies the internal gap at the DT/PC71BM interface, which makes the whole form a closer accumulation. However, the fluctuation difference of the free volume for the two relative to DT:PC71BM is only between ±0.07–0.23%, indicating that with the doping ratio of the third component of 10%, the differences of the structural domain increased from 5% to 60% have little influence on the morphology. Consistently, with the increase of the doping amount of the third component, the free volume of the system shows an increasing trend, indicating that the ratio has a greater impact on the intermolecular stacking morphology. It is worth noting that if DTE:PC71BM and P3HT:PC71BM were as the basic binary systems, the introduction of 0% → 100% DT would make the free volume of the respective free regions show different trends (see Fig. S1† for details). It reflects that the change of the molecular structure of the third component relative to the donor has a certain influence on the morphology, but the change of the morphology is more dependent on the ratio.

Intermolecular stacking pattern at the cluster level
In the D/A blend region, the intermolecular aggregation morphologies and the stacking patterns will form different intermolecular interactions, which in turn affect the CT process.51 In order to analyze the intermolecular aggregation behavior, the virtual centroid of each group was regarded as a particle to the statistic radial distribution function (RDF), g(r). The most likely centroid distance r of each group in the system was calculated respectively, corresponding to the position of the first adjacent peak in Fig. 5. Regardless of the mixed region of binary or ternary systems, there is a common phenomenon that the first-nearest neighbor RDF peak of C70@BDT has the highest intensity, indicating that PC71BM is more inclined to contact with the central BDT group, which is consistent with Wei's research work.21 It shows that structural differences and ratios could not change the stacking sites excessively. Firstly, the influence of the introduction of the third component on the molecular accumulation region was compared horizontally. For the two DT:DTE:PC71BM systems with only a 5% difference in the molecular domain, DT:DTE(0.9):PC71BM and DT:DTE(0.1):PC71BM are similar in the position (horizontal axis) of the peak value, but different in the distribution probability (vertical axis). The center-of-mass (COM) distance of C70@BDT increases first and then decreases following the increase of DTE, which exhibits an opposite trend to C70@T. It indicates that introducing a small amount of DTE can reduce the contact probability between PC71BM and the electron-donating group BDT, while increasing the contact of PC71BM with other groups, which is beneficial to improve the charge recombination process at the D/A interface. When the molecular domains have a 60% difference, there are quite different molecular arrangements at the D/A interface for DT:P3HT(0.1):PC71BM and DT:P3HT(0.9):PC71BM. Increasing the ratio of P3HT will directly inhibit the appearance of PC71BM at the T and RHD groups, indicating that the ratio determines the accumulation site of acceptors at this time. Secondly, the effects of molecular differences were compared longitudinally. It can be found that on the C70@BDT and thiophene π-bridge group (C70@T, both contained in the donor and the third component), the change trend of the introduction of DTE and P3HT is the same, indicating that the terminal group is the most affected by the ratio change (10% → 90%).
 Fig. 5  (a–f) The radial distribution function of the centroid of the C70 group of PC71BM and the different groups of the donor in the system with different ratios, and C70@BDT indicates that C70 is stacked on the BDT unit of the donor. 
Understanding the molecular stacking among the host donor and the third component is essential for estimating the photophysical processes. The stacking situation between the donors was further analyzed as shown in Fig. S3a† and the COM distance is listed in Table S1 of the ESI.†52 The COM distance of BDT@BDT in DT:PC71BM and DTE:PC71BM systems is 5.50 and 5.84 Å, respectively. Due to the steric effect of the ester-anchored side chain in DTE:PC71BM, the stacking distance was larger than that of DT:PC71BM, and both were slightly larger than the intermolecular π–π stacking distance. Upon introducing the third component, the COM distances of BDT@BDT for DT:DTE(0.1):PC71BM, DT:DTE(0.9):PC71BM, DT:P3HT(0.1):PC71BM and DT:P3HT(0.9):PC71BM are 5.18, 5.18, 11.82 and 7.00 Å, respectively. It indicates that the introduction of DTE with only a 5% domain difference from DT hardly affects the distance between BDT and BDT unit (BDT@BDT). Under the amorphous distribution of the ternary blends, there is a certain aggregation at a distance less than 5 Å between the donor and the third component, which is beneficial to hole transport, but easy to appear trap state and lead to the recombination phenomenon. According to the two almost overlapping blue solid lines in Fig. S3a,† since there is only a little difference in the side chain substituents of the third component relative to the main donor, the change of the ratio of the blend system has little effect. But for DT:P3HT(0.1):PC71BM and DT:P3HT(0.9):PC71BM with a 60% difference in the skeletal structure, the introduction of a small amount of P3HT could disturb the intermolecular deposition of DT, resulting in a larger intermolecular deposition distance, which decreases with the increase of the ratio. It shows that in DT:P3HT(0.1):PC71BM, the distribution of 10% P3HT exists at the DT/PC71BM interface, which blocks the contact distance of BDT@BDT. Under the premise of the existence of structural differences, the effect of the ratio is more obvious.
Subsequently, the C70@C70 conditions of PC71BM of RDF were explored as shown in Fig. S3b† to elucidate that DTE should be introduced in small amounts. The COMs listed in Table S1† indicate that the third component has a weak effect on the stacking between the acceptors. But from the value of radial distribution (Y axis of Fig. S3b†), it can be found that the effect of the introduction of the third component on the aggregation phenomenon for C70@C70 of PC71BM is different. With a 5% domain difference, the larger the ratio of DTE introduced, the more obvious the aggregation behavior of fullerenes, in which the overall distribution result is more inclined to DTE:PC71BM. With a 60% difference, the change in the ratio of P3HT from 10% to 90% could not continue to change the aggregation of fullerenes. Moreover, it could be found that if P3HT is the main donor, the introduction of DT could gradually increase the COM distance of C70@C70 from 10.34 → 10.36 → 10.40 Å, which makes the introduction of the third component more meaningful. It further suggests that the selection of the third component is relative and that an appropriate molecule and ratio should be chosen according to the original binary system. From a morphology perspective, the domain difference between the donor and the third component determines the degree of influence of the ratio on the morphology.
Intermolecular arrangement at the donor/acceptor interface
The relative position of each component leading to multiple configurations has been demonstrated,24 which may affect the action mechanism in the CT process. Here the statistical scope is expanded beyond face-on stacking orientations.52 According to the process of counting clusters and obtaining samples in Section S3 of the ESI,† there are 42, 42, 29, and 46 samples obtained in DT:DTE(0.1):PC71BM, DT:DTE(0.9):PC71BM, DT:P3HT(0.1):PC71BM and DT:P3HT(0.9):PC71BM, respectively. It shows that the number of configurations conforming to the acquisition criteria is the same with a 5% domain difference. And a large domain difference affects the position of the third component in the blend phase, and then affects the stacking configurations. In contrast, the effect of the molecular domain comes first and the ratio comes second.
To further explore the influence of the two variables on the film morphology, it is necessary to confirm the specific stacking orientation in the blend domains.52 As shown in Fig. S4,† considering that the typical π–π stacking distance is about 3.5 Å and the radius of C70 is about 3.5–4 Å, the first adjacent RDF peak of almost all systems deviates 7.5 Å, suggesting that face-on orientations are rare and other orientations (mainly slipped) are dominant in the system.
Since the interaction between DT and fullerene is larger, the action distance will be appropriately separated. Compared with the large steric hindrance of the central group of DTE, four thiophenes in P3HT as the center could be arbitrarily twisted into the DT/PC71BM interface without an excessive increase of DT and PC71BM. Therefore, it could be found from two sets of data, D1/A (65.85% and 53.84%) and D2/A (21.8% and 32.3%) of DT:DTE(0.1):PC71BM and DT:P3HT(0.1):PC71BM in Fig. S4b,† that introducing 10% DTE and 10% P3HT (with the same ratios) has a large difference in the distribution probability. Furthermore, compared with DTE, the introduction of P3HT as the third component into the original binary system will increase the accumulation between the third component and PC71BM, which seems to be more effective than DTE. In contrast, since the interaction between DT and PC71BM is minimal and a small amount of DT is difficult to change the interface morphology at a ratio of 90%, the orientation distribution of the two systems is not significantly different. It indicates that the introduction of the third component with small differences in structural domains can fine-tune the morphology and solve the interfacial recombination problem without reducing the mobility of fullerenes excessively. These results suggest that donor components with greater interaction with fullerenes in the device will determine the intermolecular stacking orientation. The influence of the molecular domain can be ignored under the premise of larger intermolecular interaction. Then, by identifying the size trends of D1/A, D2/A and D1/D2, the influence of the ratio is compared horizontally under the conditions of consistent structural domains. For a 5% difference, the probability of the stacking orientation between each two molecules is similar, and the ratio has a low influence on the stacking morphology. But for a 60% domain difference, the percentage difference caused by ratio variation is large, indicating that the ratio affects the probability distribution of donor and third component orientation with fullerene. From the perspective of stacking orientation, compared with the change of the molecular domain of 5% → 60%, the change of the ratio of 10% → 90% has more influence on the stacking between the donor and the third component.
For further analyzing the effect of the molecular structure classification and fragment difference on the arrangement at the D/A interface, the relative positions including face-on, edge-on and slipped orientations were calculated. As shown in Fig. 6, both DTE and P3HT have thiophene π-bridge domains similar to DT, so the ratio of orientation distribution on the thiophene π-bridge is the largest, which is not affected by the ratio and domain differences. In the case of the 5% domain difference, with the increase of the ratio, the orientation distribution in the BDT domain increases gradually, while the orientation distribution in the T domain and RHD domain decreases relatively, which will increase the probability of bimolecular recombination. The opposite trend occurs for the 60% domain difference, which inhibits the bimolecular recombination and promotes the exciton dissociation ability. It further shows that the effect of the ratio on the interface layout depends on the specific domain difference value, where P3HT is more suitable as the main donor. From the perspective of interfacial arrangement, although the third component (like DTE) with a similar structure to the main donor can be easily synthesized, the ratio should not be too large. If the third component (like P3HT) whose structure is different from that of the main donor is selected, the cascade energy level arrangement should be considered.

In order to explain that the ratio of the third component depends on the similarity of its structure to the donor, the stacking configurations contained in each cluster were counted with decreasing dimensionality of inquiry. According to whether there is interaction between molecules, the stacking configuration was divided into D2/D1/A, D1/A/D2 and D1/D2/A, and the BSSE correction method was used to calculate the interaction energy in each cluster.53 By comparing the effects of the ratio horizontally as shown in Fig. 7a and b, it can be seen that the configuration distribution of DT:DTE(0.1):PC71BM and DT:DTE(0.9):PC71BM is relatively uniform. Due to the high frequency of D2/D1/A and D1/D2/A stacking configurations, DT:DTE(0.1):PC71BM and DT:DTE(0.9):PC71BM tend to mix DT and DTE first, and then interact with PC71BM. As the ratio increases, the interaction energy of D2/D1/A gradually decreases, while D1/A/D2 and D1/D2/A gradually increases, indicating that DTE and PC71BM have greater interaction since DTE has an ester group, resulting in DTE entering the DT/PC71BM interface. This phenomenon has also been confirmed by experimental articles.21,54 In contrast, DT:P3HT(0.1):PC71BM and DT:P3HT(0.9):PC71BM with different skeletons present extremely obvious differences. There is almost no D1/D2/A arrangement in DT:P3HT(0.1):PC71BM as shown in Fig. 7c, showing that a small amount of P3HT is not easy to enter the DT/PC71BM interface. With the increase of the doping amount of P3HT, the D1/D2/A position arrangement dominates in DT:P3HT(0.9):PC71BM (Fig. 7d), demonstrating a completely opposite trend from the former. According to the RDF in Fig. S3a,† the DT domain is prone to self-aggregation behavior compared with P3HT, where a higher DT doping rate can interfere with the bicontinuous interpenetrating network of P3HT and PC71BM. Therefore, it is more reasonable to introduce 90% P3HT for the DT:P3HT:PC71BM system. By longitudinal comparison of the influence of the domain difference, it can be found that compared with DTE, P3HT has a strong induction force, whose ratio directly affects the internal molecular arrangement, thus affecting the film morphology. Moreover, the domain difference will directly determine the doping ratio of the third component in the device. It was confirmed again that the domain difference could decide the effect of the ratio. Based on the influence of the ratio on the morphology, the internal arrangement could be regulated, thus affecting the CT path.

The X-axis represents the configurations of ten clusters extracted from molecular dynamics simulations (1∼10 clu.), and the Y-axis represents three stacking configurations. The color of the square indicates the average energy of the configuration in the cluster, where the gray square indicates that the cluster lacks this configuration. 
Distribution of CT states
The count, energy, and oscillator strength of CT states play a decisive role in the competitive relationship between exciton dissociation and charge recombination. Low-lying CT states with more count and strong oscillator strengths are conducive to efficient CT. In order to ensure the reliability of the analysis, the first 20 excited states of each configuration were processed on the basis of considering the possibility of excitation, that is, 3180 data were statistically analyzed to quantify the CT states. The charge distribution difference method was used to identify the CT states in which electrons and holes were completely separated as shown in Fig. S5.†55 The CT-state distribution does not change with the increase of the doping ratio of the third component, indicating that the ratio has little effect on the CT states. In addition, the count of low-lying CT states of DT:P3HT:PC71BM is much more than that of DT:DTE:PC71BM. The former mainly comes from P3HT → PC71BM (D2 → A), but the oscillator strength is lower than that of the latter. It indicates that CT effectiveness hardly depends on the domain difference, but more importantly on the rationality of the selection of the third component relative to the original binary system.
The essence of intermolecular interaction
From the above characterization and analysis, it can be seen that the processes and objects affected by the domain difference and ratio are different. The former is more likely to affect the internal structure and then the electronic properties of the interface, but the latter is more inclined to affect the morphology. To further explain the above phenomenon, the interaction essence was revealed by energy decomposition analysis56,57 following the interface configurations fragmented in pairs. As shown in Fig. 8, the intermolecular interactions in the four systems are dominated by dispersion on the whole. Only the dispersion attraction and dispersion repulsion simultaneously exist in DT:DTE(0.1):PC71BM, which laterally reflects that the distribution of the third component is different from the others regarding the microscopic morphology, leading to different CT paths.
 Fig. 8  Energy decomposition analysis including the electrostatic, repulsion and dispersion interaction (X-axis) between every two molecules (D1–D2, D1-A and D2-A, Y-axis), and the color cards corresponding to the rows indicate the energies (kcal/mol) of the interactions between the host donor and the third component (D1–D2), the host donor and the acceptor (D1-A), and the third component and the acceptor (D2-A) in the ternary configurations. 
DT:DTE(0.9):PC71BM and DT:P3HT(0.9):PC71BM are similar in that the dispersion attraction and exchange mutual exclusion of D1-A and D2-A increase with the decrease of the DT ratio, indicating that both of them have more π–π interactions, which can promote the CT process. Since fullerenes are non-polar molecules, the interaction region with the donor is non-polar, resulting in minimal electrostatic interaction of D1-A and D2-A. Moreover, Fig. 8 could intuitively show that the ratio and domain difference have little effect on the interaction of D1-A and D2-A, which is consistent with the relative position shown in Fig. S4,† but both easily affect the interaction of D1–D2. However, for DT:DTE(0.1):PC71BM and DT:DTE(0.9):PC71BM with similar skeletons, the electrostatic interactions of D1–D2 were significantly different. On the one hand, there is an ester group on the side chain of DTE, which can increase the interaction with PC71BM. On the other hand, the larger interaction makes DTE located at the DT/PC71BM interface in DT:DTE(0.1):PC71BM, leading more possibilities of the accumulation between DT and DTE, while DT was excluded from the DTE/PC71BM interface in DT:DTE(0.9):PC71BM, which is consistent with the coordinate distribution phenomenon in Fig. S1.† This shows that although DT and DTE have only slight differences in the ester group of the side chain, the interactions between the two and fullerenes are still different. Therefore, when the ratio increases, the distribution of 10% DTE in DT:DTE(0.1):PC71BM is quite different from the 10% DT distribution area in DT:DTE(0.9):PC71BM, which changes the intermolecular interactions, resulting in different CT routes. For DT:P3HT:PC71BM with dissimilar skeletons, due to strong donor characteristics of P3HT, the doping ratio has almost little effect on the more D2 → A route.
Conclusions
In this work, the CT pathways of four systems are proved to be different, regulated by the doping ratio and domain difference of the third component. Using these two factors as a starting point, an action–reaction relationship between the structural domain difference and doping ratio was found, explaining how the two influencing factors acted on the CT pathway. The role of the domain difference is priority, which determines the degree of effect of the ratio, including morphology, stacking site and interfacial arrangement. Smaller domain differences between the host donor and the third component tend to induce alloy-like states, where the CT path and amount are strongly ratio-dependent. But with a larger domain difference, the CT path will strictly follow the principle of energy level gradient distribution.
We suggest that the selection of the third component should first pay attention to the differences in the structure, which may easily lead to differences in the accumulation of donors and acceptors. And the role of the ratio is less priority, under a certain domain difference, adjusting the ratio can regulate the molecular arrangement and in turn affect the CT path. We advocate that the choice of the third component should be determined according to the purpose; for example, the combination of similar structures between donors with fullerenes is more conducive to the exploration of the mechanism. We hope that our work on the decisive influence of the domain difference on the ratio could provide a guiding role for experimentalists and theorists to further explore the optical physical mechanism of T-OSCs.
