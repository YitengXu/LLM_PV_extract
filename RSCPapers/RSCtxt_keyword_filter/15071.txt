The motivation for PSCs as next-generation solar cells stems from their simple and easy solution processing capabilities. However, some serious challenges including stability, scalability, and flexibility limit the industrial applications of PSCs. To address these challenges, graphene-based nanomaterials (GBNs) have been incorporated in conductive electrodes, photoactive layer including light harvesting materials, i.e., perovskite layer, carrier transport layer such as electron transport layer and interface, hole transport layer, and interfaces and encapsulation layer of PSCs because of their excellent optical, electronic, photonic, thermal, and mechanical properties. To improve the efficiency, reproducibility, and stability of PSCs in real working conditions, interfacial, defect, and compositional engineering using GBNs were studied. Herein, the latest reports on the use of GBNs in PSCs have been reviewed. Also, the prospects and challenges of graphene-based PSCs are discussed. Some possible strategies to address these challenges have also been suggested.Zohreh NiaziZohreh Niazi is currently a PhD student in Physical Chemistry under the supervision of Prof. Elaheh K.

1. Introduction
With population growth and economic progress, global energy demand is growing rapidly. Fossil fuels are the chief energy resources worldwide.1,2 A series of environmental problems including climate change, global warming, air pollution, and acid rains has originated from the burning of fossil fuels.3 The development of renewable energy technologies is a serious need to deal with present political, economic, and environmental world challenges.4 Among renewable energy sources including hydropower, traditional biomass, solar, wind, and biofuels, solar energy is clean, simply available, infinite, and permanent.5 Solar energy is an abundant and cheap renewable source.6 The growing demand for electricity has caused rapid development in photovoltaic (PV) technologies.7 Converting solar energy into electricity is one of the most suitable ways to overcome the world's energy challenge.8,9
A solar cell converts sunlight to electricity.10–12 The structure of a solar cell or device is represented in Fig. 1. A solar cell contains two electrodes of anode and cathode, photoactive layer, and carrier transport layers. Each part of a solar cell has special features. Usually, the electrodes are composed of materials with high transparency, thermal stability, and low sheet resistance (Rs).13 Solar cells are constructed on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) substrates, which act as anode and permit light to enter into the cell. They provide a convenient path for the transportation of charge from back contact to the external circuit. The most common TCO substrates used as anode in solar cells are conductive oxide glasses including fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) and indium tin oxide (ITO). The carrier transport layers include electron transport layer (ETL) and hole transport layer (HTL).14 The ETL extracts the photogenerated electrons from the photoactive layer and transports them to anode. Also, it blocks holes to decrease the recombination of charge carriers at the interface. The HTL transfers holes to the cathode, blocks electrons, and protects the photoactive layer from ambient conditions such as humidity, heat, and oxygen.15 Usually, a photoactive layer with the ability to capture wide light spectrum, high charge carrier mobility, and enhanced thermal and photochemical stability is put between the ETL and HTL. Typically, a thin layer of gold, aluminum, or silver plays the role of a cathode and is put at the top layer.16

The performance of the solar cell device is evaluated with the power conversion efficiency (PCE), which depends on open circuit voltage, VOC, short circuit current density, JSC, and fill factor.17,18
Among the various PV technologies reported to date, organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have maintained their status for electricity production.19,20 In recent years, PSCs have been improved significantly with the values of PCE from 3.8% to 25.5%.21–27 Perovskites have ABX3 crystal structures, where A is an organic/inorganic cation such as cesium, methylammonium (MA), and/or formamidinium (FA), B stands for a metal cation including tin and/or lead, and X is a halide anion including chlorine, bromine, and/or iodine.28–31 The bandgap of perovskites is usually tuned from 1.15 to 3.06 eV by interchanging the cations, metals, and/or halides in their structures.32 Perovskites have attractive applications besides photovoltaics ranging from sensing, lasing, light-emitting devices, photodetectors, and X-ray detectors due to their tunable bandgap.33–40 Perovskite materials have several advantages including strong absorption in a widespread window up to 800 nm, long carrier diffusion lengths (>175 μm), high ambipolar charge transporting ability, low recombination loss, low exciton binding energy (<25 meV), high carrier mobility, low cost, simple processability, remarkably high PCE, and composition and bandgap tunability.41–50
Typically, the PSCs are divided into 3 kinds of mesoporous n-i-p, planar n-i-p, and planar p-i-n (Fig. 2).51 A compact ETL is usually deposited on the TCO layer in a mesoporous PSC (Fig. 2a). A mesoporous layer with nanoscale pores is deposited at the top of the compact layer.
 Fig. 2  The PSCs architectures: (a) mesoporous n-i-p, (b) planar n-i-p, (c) planar p-i-n. 
The mesoporous layer helps the charge separation and assists in preventing the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) hysteresis in PSCs. The mesoporous layer thickness may influence the device performance. A perovskite absorber layer (photoactive layer) covers the mesoporous layer, forms a dense coating layer, and penetrates into the mesoporous layer, leading to an intermixed layer.51 For high performance PSCs, the perovskite layer should have high crystallinity and suitable thickness. The HTL and the top electrode are successively placed on the perovskite layer.52
The planar PSCs (Fig. 2b and c) have been broadly used because of their unique advantages such as low-temperature processing, easy processing, and low price.53–57 Planar PSCs can be fabricated using either a normal structure (Fig. 2b) or inverted structure (Fig. 2c). The normal planar n-i-p construction comprises a compacted ETL layer and does not have the perovskite-ETL intermixed layer in contrast to the mesoporous PSCs. The planar p-i-n construction is usually denoted by the inverted structure since the carrier transport layers are reversed in comparison with the n-i-p construction. The devices with a planar p-i-n structure are frequently made with a compact HTL. The inverted PSCs have received much attention because of their easy construction process, negligible hysteresis, low process temperature, and high stability. The performance of a device mainly depends on the material used for device construction.51
There may be parasitic absorption in the contact layers, which may cause photocurrent losses. Other problems of PSCs comprise cell instability (humidity, thermal, and UV instabilities) and the usage of lead, which is a toxic element.58–60 Graphene-based nanomaterials (GBNs) such as graphene, graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (RGO), nitrogen-doped graphene, and graphene quantum dots (GQDs) are the best candidates to address these challenges due to their outstanding optical, electronic, photonic, thermal, and mechanical properties.61 They can enhance the lifetime and stability and improve the performance of PSCs through several strategies including interface, defect, and compositional engineering.62,63
GBNs can be used in different parts of PSCs including conductive electrodes such as transparent anode and transparent cathode, the photoactive layer including light harvesting materials, i.e., perovskite layer, carrier transport layers including ETL and interfaces, and HTL and interfaces, and the encapsulation layers, as shown in Fig. 3.
 Fig. 3  Schematic illustration of the applications of GBNs in different parts of PSCs. 
Graphene is the basic unit for all graphite substances such as fullerene, GQDs, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and graphene nanoribbons (GNRs).64–69
Much efforts have been made to improve the efficiency and performance of PSCs by introducing various materials in different parts of these cells.70–73 Among these compounds, GBNs found a special place due to their unique properties including excellent electrical conductivity, EC, (7 × 107 to 1 × 108 S m−1), high thermal conductivity, TC (∼5000 W m−1 K−1), large theoretical specific surface area (2630 m2 g−1), high carrier mobility (200000 cm2 V−1 s−1), high Young's modulus (∼1 TPa), and high mechanical strength (130 GPa).66,74–81
Also, GBNs increases the flexibility of these cells. Due to the unique properties of GBNs, they have been used in numerous fields and practical applications,82–84 in addition to PSCs, including in freshwater production by solar desalination,85–88 degradation of pollutants,89–93 oil/water separation,94–96 and in medicine as antibacterial,97–100 antiviral,101 and anticancer agents,102 biosensors,103,104 and fuel cells105 (see Fig. 4).

In the present review, some recent advances in the use of GBNs to reach the necessary requirements (efficiency, long-term stability, and cost) in PSCs are discussed. This review also provides more possibilities in designing effective passivation materials in the future of PV devices to achieve highly efficient and stable devices. Lastly, the challenges of graphene-based PSCs are discussed. Also, some strategies to address these challenges are suggested.
2. Synthetic methods of GBNs
Generally, two methods for the preparation of GBNs such as single layer graphene (SLG), bilayer graphene, and few layer graphene (FLG) are top-down and bottom-up methods.106,107 In the top-down method, the graphene sheets are formed by two ways.
(1) Exfoliation of graphite and graphite intercalated compounds through solid-phase, liquid-phase, or electrochemical methods. The solid-phase exfoliation methods involve: (i) micromechanical exfoliation108 and (ii) dry ball-milling exfoliation of graphite.109,110 Liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) is a cheap way to produce defect-free SLG and FLG in different liquid media. In contradiction of solid phase peeling, this method has attractive advantages of ease of scale production and the possibility of solution processing. The electrochemical exfoliation of graphite is a rapid, harmless, and green technique for producing and functionalizing of graphene. In this method, graphite rods or foils are utilized as a sacrificial electrode (usually anode).111–113 Several electrolytes including ionic liquids, acids, and inorganic salts have been used for exfoliating the graphite into graphene by the electrochemical exfoliation method. Parvez et al.114 used several inorganic salts containing sulfate ions, namely, K2SO4, Na2SO4, and (NH4)2SO4 in exfoliating the graphite into graphene. Graphene with a high carbon/oxygen (C/O) ratio of 17.2 and a remarkable hole mobility of 310 cm2 V−1 s−1 was prepared by sulfate-based salts. Zhang et al.115 used Na2SO4–FeSO4 as an electrolyte to synthesize Fe2O3/graphene by the deposition of Fe2O3 and electrochemical peeling of graphene sheets. The opportunity of mass production of graphene at lower cost is an advantage of this method.116 The main drawback of this method is the use of constant voltage bias to the electrode. Other disadvantages of this method are slight oxidation and inhomogeneous flake thickness.113
(2) Reduction of GO to RGO by chemical, thermal, and electrochemical methods.117–119 GO is reduced chemically with the help of a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride,120 hydrazine,121 hydroxylamine,122 hydroquinone,123 ascorbic acid,124 and sodium citrate.97 The π-network rebuilding amount of RGO is generally subject to reducing agent strength (strong or weak), which in turn affects its properties. Silva et al.125 prepared RGO by the weak and green reducing agent of ascorbic acid. Guex et al.126 reduced GO into RGO using sodium borohydride and observed a significant improvement in the conductivity from 0.0003 S m−1 for GO to 1500 S m−1 for RGO. Jamsaz and Goharshadi94 reduced GO partially into RGO by hydrazine. Chemical reduction has some disadvantages such as high defect density and it is not an environment-friendly process.127 The thermal reduction of GO can be performed by thermal annealing, hydrothermal, or solvothermal methods. Thermal reduction is usually performed at temperatures greater than 200 °C by annealing GO under vacuum or inert atmosphere.128,129 An inevitable structural damage by released gas during thermal annealing is one of the disadvantages of this process.130 The hydrothermal and solvothermal methods are performed in an autoclave at high temperature, and the π-conjugation system is restored to a large extent. The hydrothermal method is usually performed at 120–180 °C for 1–18 h.131,132 At temperatures greater than the supercritical point of water, the oxygen functional groups of GO are reduced.133,134 Mahvelati-Shamsabadi et al.89 and Mahvelati-Shamsabadi and Goharshadi135 reduced GO to RGO in an autoclave at 180 °C for 12 h.
Graphene sheets are produced by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or epitaxial growth in bottom-up methods.136 Graphene sheets could be prepared by the pyrolysis of hydrocarbon precursors such as CH4, C2H6, and C3H8 on the metal catalyst surface in a CVD method. CVD graphene growth is performed by two steps. In the first step, the decomposition of gas precursors and the formation of carbon take place. In the second step, graphene is formed on the metal catalyst surface. Pyrolysis should be performed on a metallic surface catalyst to absorb the carbon atoms and prevent the precipitation of carbon clusters. The breakdown, diffusion, and segregation of carbon atoms require a temperature over 2500 °C. Using a metal catalyst, the reduction temperature is reduced to about 1000 °C. The etching process is also needed to detach graphene from the metal catalyst.137–139 Some process parameters including gas flow, catalyst, processing time, and pressure affect the properties of the produced graphene. Yang et al.140 examined the effect of change of flow rate of acetylene on the domain size, defect density, layer number, and Rs of the produced graphene. High-quality SLG was prepared at a low flow rate of acetylene (0.28 cm3 min−1). Highly transparent graphene with high conductivity can be prepared by the CVD method. However, CVD is expensive and needs relatively high temperature and complicated transfer processes. Large-scale FLG can be prepared by epitaxial graphene growth on the single-crystalline silicon carbide (SiC). In this method, a commercial SiC is annealed at high temperature usually greater than 1400 °C in vacuum. Silicon atoms evaporate at this high temperature and hence carbon atoms are placed on the surface to form graphitic layers called FLG.141 Gupta et al.142 grew graphene on cubic SiC (111)/Si (111) substrates in the temperature range from 1125 to 1375 °C. With rising temperature, the number of graphene layers increased and the graphene quality also improved. Ouerghi et al.143 prepared even large-scale single and double layers of graphene on off-axis 6H–SiC (0001) substrates. The main advantage of epitaxial graphene growth in SiC is that the graphene layers are produced directly on a semiconductor or commercial insulating substrate. Some disadvantages of this approach are high defect density and relatively high energy consumption. The synthetic methods of GBNs are summarized in Fig. 5.

3. Graphene-based nanomaterials in PSCs
The incorporation of GBNs in PSCs is fascinating because of their cheap preparation, high chemical stability, and the possibility of changing the work function.144 GBNs are incorporated as the conductive electrode including transparent anode and transparent cathode, the photoactive layer including light harvesting materials, i.e., perovskite layer, carrier transport layer including ETL and interface, HTL and interface, and the encapsulation layer.
3.1. Conductive electrodes
GBNs have several advantages over the conventional electrodes and can be replaced with brittle TCOs such as ITO and FTO (Fig. 6). The work function of both pristine graphene and ITO or FTO is similar (∼4.5 eV), which clearly shows that graphene can serve the same function. Table 1 shows the previous outcomes of the usage of GBNs as conductive electrodes in PSCs. ITO electrode has high EC and very high transmittance in the visible spectrum. The poor mechanical properties (extremely brittle), high cost, toxicity, inflexibility, material abundance limitations, and instability at high temperature are the main drawbacks of ITO or FTO electrodes that suggest the need for alternative substrates. Graphene derivatives have been demonstrated to be highly capable nanoelectrodes since they have several advantages over ITO, FTO, and rare metals including high conductivity (low Rs), high transparency, and good mechanical flexibility and are the best choice to be used as transparent electrodes.74 In addition, graphene and its derivatives are economically favorable over ITO or FTO owing to the abundance and low-cost of carbon. Besides, due to the hydrophobic character of the graphene surface, it can provide PSCs protection against air and moisture. Hence, graphene can improve the stability of the device.74

3.1.1. Transparent conducive anode. 
GBNs have been effectively used as the transparent conductive anode for flexible PSCs. Tran et al.152 made PSC devices having a planar structure containing aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO)/Ag/AZO/PCBM/MAPbI3/NiOx/graphene/polyestersulfone (PES) substrate to examine the impact of perovskite width on the device performance (Fig. 7a and b). They used transfer-free and extensive monolayer graphene as an electrode. Graphene was synthesized through plasma-assisted thermal chemical vapor deposition (PATCVD) at 150 °C on PES substrate. Then, the improved semi-transparent flexible PSCs were prepared by synthesized graphene as a transparent conducting anode. Graphene was synthesized on Cu foil through CVD growth at 950 °C as a reference sample. The flat and thick perovskite MAPbI3 films were produced through CVD instead of solution technique with a thickness of ∼300 nm. First, the high-quality and extensive monolayer graphene electrodes were prepared directly on a PES substrate at 150 °C without a transfer process. PATCVD-graphene exhibited an excellent mechanical elasticity and a low Rs of ∼82 Ω sq−1 in comparison to the transferred graphene (∼2011 Ω sq−1). A transmittance of ∼85.6% at a wavelength of 550 nm was achieved for the monolayer PATCVD-graphene. The transmittance of the transferred graphene was ∼81.8%. A PCE >14% with a transmittance of about 26% at a wavelength of 700 nm was obtained for solar cell devices containing PATCVD-graphene bottom electrodes. The devices revealed a great flexibility over 1000 bending cycles by keeping the PCE greater than 90% with respect to the original value.

Shin and his co-workers153 made the p-i-n-type PSCs using GQDs HTL and graphene transparent conductive electrode co-doped with gold nanoparticles (NPs) and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) amide (TFSA). The PSCs were made as graphene/GQDs/MAPbI3/PCBM/Al, where the graphene is pristine or doped single layer. The graphene co-doped with Au NPs and TFSA demonstrated outstanding properties including high transmittance in the visible region (∼93.5%), low Rs (83 Ω sq−1), and high work function (4.93 eV). By the single doping or co-doping of graphene with Au NPs and TFSA, the transmittance in the wavelength from 300 to 900 nm reduced because of the adsorbed impurities on the surface. Specifically, the transmittance at 550 nm was ∼97.6% before doping, and it decreased to 94.3, 97.2, and 93.5% after doping with Au NPs, TFSA, and Au NPs/TFSA, respectively. The transmittance of graphene co-doped with Au NPs and TFSA transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs) in the visible region was kept at over 90%. The Rs value of pristine graphene ranged from 700 to 760 Ω sq−1. By doping graphene with Au NPs, TFSA, and Au NPs/TFSA, the average value of Rs decreased to 162, 212, and 83 Ω sq−1, respectively. The average work function/carrier mobility values of the graphene TCE were 4.62 eV/2150 cm2 V−1 s−1 before doping and increased/decreased to 4.74/1137, 4.88/1352, and 4.93 eV/954 cm2 V−1 s−1 after doping with Au NPs, TFSA, and Au NPs/TFSA, respectively. Pristine graphene-based PSCs had the lowest PCE due to the comparatively high Rs in spite of the high transmittance/mobility regardless of the type of the dopant. The doped graphene TCEs exhibited significantly high photovoltaic performance because of the high conductivity of graphene. In particular, owing to the enhanced charge separation, the co-doped graphene PSCs showed the largest photovoltaic parameters including 17.02/17.15% PCE, 1.08/1.08 V VOC, 20.42/20.55 mA cm−2JSC, and 77.15/77.29% FF for forward/reverse scans in comparison with the control cells (17.53/17.55%) with PEDOT:PSS HTL. Approximately 28% reduction in the PCE was achieved during 30 days in N2 atmosphere for GQDs-based PSCs, while the PCE decreased by 42% for the PEDOT:PSS cells for the same period. The PSCs with GQDs HTL exhibited a PCE of 13/15% for forward/reverse scans, respectively. The devices maintained ∼70% of their original PCE values over 3000 bending cycles.
Jeon et al.154 used graphene as a transparent carbon electrode in the inverted flexible PSCs in comparison with ITO and CNT-based bottom electrodes. The PCE of the graphene-based PSCs (14.2%) showed an improvement with respect to CNT-based PSCs (12.8%) because of the 2D structure of graphene. The graphene film had a higher transmittance with respect to ITO. The PSCs using ITO electrode showed a PCE of 17.8%.
Luo et al.155 fabricated flexible PSCs with graphene and cross-stacking CNTs (CSCNTs) as an anode and a cathode, respectively (Fig. 8a and b). The carbon electrode-based PSCs with and without spiro-OMeTAD hole conductor achieved PCEs of 11.9% and 8.4%, respectively. The flexible carbon electrode-based solar cells showed higher strength under mechanical distortion compared with their complements prepared on ITO substrates. Also, the carbon electrode-based flexible PSCs are more stable compared with the flexible devices with Au and Ag cathodes under light or 60 °C thermal strain so that over 90% of the original PCEs after 1000 h were retained.

3.1.2. Transparent conducive cathode. 
GBNs are utilized as the transparent conductive cathode in solar cells due to their optical transparency, excellent EC, and chemical stability.156 Meng et al.157 reported a hysteresis-free all carbon-based PSCs using C60 as ETL with the structure of FTO/C60/MAPbI3/carbon. A maximum PCE of 15.38% without hysteresis was achieved for the carbon-based PSCs prepared with C60, which was much greater than that of TiO2 (12.06% with hysteresis). In addition, they replaced FTO with graphene-based TCEs with the structure of quartz/graphene/C60/MAPbI3/carbon. The forward/reverse scans yielded a PCE of 13.58%/13.93%, respectively. Because of the much higher Rs of the graphene-based TCEs (400 Ω sq−1), the FF value of all carbon-based PSCs (0.59) was less than that of all carbon-based PSCs with FTO (0.61).

3.2. Perovskite layer and carrier transport layers
One method for improving the stability and optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials is to use GBNs in the perovskite layer and interfacial layer (Fig. 9).

Also, GBNs are suitable candidates for the ETL, HTL, both hole and electron transport layers, and interfacial layer in the PSCs (see Fig. 9 and 10). They enhance the PSCs performance by improving the morphology of the top-deposited perovskite layer, facilitating the charge extraction from the perovskite photoactive layer into the HTL and ETL layers, speeding up the transfer of holes and electrons, and protecting the perovskite photoactive layer from humidity and UV radiation.16Table 2 summarizes previous reports, which used GBNs in the perovskite layer or as ETL, HTL, both hole ETL and HTL, and interfacial layer in the PSCs.

3.2.1. Perovskite layer. 
The stability of PSCs should be confirmed for practical applications. The instability of a device is related to the destruction of perovskite structure owing to ion migration, humidity, and thermal and light instability under sunlight. The instability of perovskite thin films in ambient environment is the greatest hindrance for their commercial applications. Under a humid environment, the perovskite is easily hydrolyzed and decomposed from dark brown into yellowish thin films.189 To resolve this issue, an additional layer of graphene or its derivatives can be deposited as an encapsulation on top of the perovskite photoactive layer.190–192 Since pristine graphene is intrinsically hydrophobic in nature, it is a suitable candidate as a barrier for moisture in PSCs. A graphene layer or its derivatives in PSCs increases the device lifetime with a better stability not only with respect to moisture but also by preventing photooxidation.193 In addition, the diffusion of halide ions from the perovskite photoactive layer to the top metal electrode can also be prevented by such a modification. Hence, GBNs increase the stability and the photovoltaic performance of PSCs because of their unique properties. Ameen et al.194 fabricated the inverted planar heterojunction solar cells (IPHSCs) with GO-modified perovskite (MAPbI3) as a sensitizer and spiro-bifluorene (CF-Sp-BTh)-based hole transport material (HTM). A fairly great hole mobility and promising HOMO level compared with the valence band of MAPbI3 by including 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzene unit as the electron-acceptor was achieved. A PCE of ∼14.28% with a VOC of ∼1.07 V and JSC of ∼18.82 mA cm−2 was obtained for IPHSCs using CF-Sp-BTh HTM and GO (0.5 wt%)-MAPbI3. FTO/CF-Sp-BTh/GO (0.5 wt%)-MAPbI3/PCBM/Au had advanced photovoltaic performance with respect to MAPbI3 and other GO-MAPbI3 hybrid-based devices. The IPHSCs fabricated with CF-Sp-BTh HTM and 0.5 wt% GO represented better charge mobility and enhanced the charge separation. Zhang et al.195 incorporated GQDs into organic-inorganic halide perovskite (MAPbI3) to obtain highly crystalline and even perovskite films with larger charge extraction (Fig. 11). Because of the advantages of GQDs including its quantum size and outstanding EC, the perovskite film with good quality and flat surface was prepared. Also, higher charge extraction efficiency and lesser leakage current were obtained by including GQDs. In fact, GQDs can help as an electron collector as well as an electron transport connection, resulting in an effective separation of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. The best performance with 11% enhancement in PCE was achieved for the PSCs with 0.1% GQDs compared with the pristine devices.

Mahmoudi et al.196 fabricated PSCs based on perovskite/silver NPs hybrid with RGO (perovskite/Ag-RGO) composites (Fig. 12). In the presence of Ag-RGO, the ion migration was suppressed and the thermal and light stability was improved. The PSCs tolerated more than 94% of the original PCE for 90 h, while the PSCs without Ag-RGO presented a 39% decrease in their initial PCEs. The composite-based PSCs displayed an outstanding long-term stability and maintained approximately 100% of their original values of the performance parameters for more than 330 days. The most operative approach for increasing the PCE of the PSCs is to reduce the charge recombination at the surface or grain boundaries. Fang et al.160 reported the high-efficiency PSCs by introducing GQDs to perovskite. When the amount of GQDs in the solution was 7 vol%, the highest average PCE of 17.62% was achieved. 8.2% enhancement compared with the pristine perovskite-based devices was achieved. Also, the GQDs-perovskite-based devices demonstrated a lower charge transfer resistance, meaning that GQDs can improve charge transfer from the perovskite layer to ETL. GQDs-perovskite-based PSCs showed quicker electron abstraction and a lower recombination rate compared with the pure perovskite film. The faster recombination rate of pure PSCs confirmed the presence of electron trap sites at the grain boundaries between the perovskite crystals. GQDs are connected via hydrogen bonds with the perovskite at the grain boundaries and passivate the traps; hence, the recombination rate reduces, the abstraction of electrons from the perovskite increases, and the performance of the PSCs improves.

Chung et al.166 fabricated PSCs with the configuration ITO/GO/MAPbI3:GO/PCBM/Ag (Fig. 13a and b). They mixed GO with MAPbI3 (0.05 mg mL−1) and used GO as a p-type electrode. The device represented a PCE 15.2% superior to that of a planar heterojunction device (PCE 12.3%) prepared by means of pure perovskite. The perovskite and GO was represented as a hole donor and hole acceptor in the hybrid perovskite, respectively. The combination of GO with MAPbI3 has the advantages of (1) increase in charge mobility, (2) enhancement of charge separation, and (3) reduction of charge recombination within the perovskite photoactive layer.

Hadadian et al.197 incorporated nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-RGO) in organic–inorganic halide perovskite (Fig. 14a and b), which has two advantages on the performance of PSCs: (1) the increase in perovskite grain size because of retarding the crystallization step, leading to higher current and FF in the perovskite film, and (2) passivating the surface and slowing down the electron–hole recombination led to improved VOC. Due to the larger grain size of perovskite/N-RGO and less grain boundaries, the device exhibited a nearly hysteresis-free PCE of 18.73% with respect to the reference cell with 17.31% (Fig. 14c). Also, the perovskite/N-RGO showed nearly full surface coverage with larger grains compared with the reference perovskite.

By incorporating GBNs into perovskite films, the grain size increases. However, the interaction of GBNs with perovskite is not strong. To improve the interaction, graphene should be functionalized with appropriate chemical groups. For example, chlorinated GO (Cl–GO) was incorporated on the perovskite surface.198 This incorporation has several advantages of (1) forming a strong ionic bond between inorganic molecules and perovskite, (2) decreasing ion migration from the perovskite into the HTL, (3) decreasing the component loss of perovskite and maintaining the properties of HTL during the real operation of PSC devices, (4) passivating the defects, and (5) enhancing the stability of the PSC devices.


3.2.2. Electron transport layer. 
Electron-extraction materials should have a little work function to permit the electrical field across the photoactive layer and electron transport toward the cathode. Some ETLs include lithium fluoride,199,200 n-type inorganic semiconductors such as TiO2, TiOx, ZnO, and SnO2,201 n-type organic semiconductors such as 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline202 and conjugated polymer electrolytes.203 The recombination of excitons and/or charge carriers is one of the main limitations in photocurrent production. Mesoporous TiO2 is one of the most common ETLs, which extracts the generated photoexcited electrons from the absorber layer. High temperatures (∼500 °C) are required for the sintering/crystallization of mesoporous TiO2. The high temperature process for the sintering of electron collection layer is unfavorable for low-cost device manufacturing. Also, they are not compatible with flexible deposition substrates.74 Two major requirements for the ETL layer are the high electron mobility of the material and the matching of bandgap with an absorber material. These properties guarantee the transfer of the produced photoelectron in the absorber layer effectively to the ETL layer, followed by migration to TCO. Graphene and its derivatives have high mobility and conductivity; therefore, they are suitable candidates. The thin film made from graphene and its derivatives can be prepared at a low temperature (∼150 °C) and they can withstand an intense solar radiation and harsh conditions. The conventional structural design of PSCs requires high temperature processing for the preparation of metal oxide thin films such as TiO2 as ETL, which is a great challenge for the market entry.16 The incorporation of graphene materials in TiO2 significantly impacts the electrical properties of the fabricated device. Moreover, intimate interfacial contact between TiO2 and GBNs can not only can decrease the series resistance but can also decrease the recombination rate in the photoactive layer and improve the device performance considerably.
ZnO is one of the most attractive ETLs for solar cells owing to its higher electron mobility than TiO2 and it is a suitable n-type semiconductor with direct bandgap. The ZnO nanolayer can be placed through spin-coating at a low temperature (80–100 °C), which has the advantages of energy-efficiency and the mass production of photovoltaic devices. Unfortunately, ZnO devices suffer from performance instability produced by impurities in the manufacturing process. Furthermore, PSCs with ZnO NPs as ETL have low PCE owing to charge recombination at the ZnO NPs/perovskite interface.204,205
Chandrasekhar et al.205 used the nitrogen-doped graphene/ZnO nanorod nanocomposites (ZnO NR NCs) as ETL for PSCs. The PSCs demonstrated an enhanced JSC and PCE from 17.38 mA cm−2 to 21.98 mA cm−2 and from 12.87% to 16.82% in comparison to pristine ZnO NRs, respectively. The better penetration of perovskite material in ZnO NRs can be obtained by nitrogen-doped graphene, leading to a perovskite film with higher surface coverage. Khan and Khan206 modified the ZnO ETL in PSCs using RGO. The PCE of unmodified and modified devices were calculated as 15.93% and 17.08%, respectively. Belchi et al.207 synthesized TiO2/graphene nanocomposites by laser pyrolysis. Near electronic contact between the two materials was obtained due to the good quality of the TiO2/graphene interface. TiO2/graphene was used as an ETL in PSCs based on the reference MAPbI3−xClx halide perovskite photoactive layer. The average PCE value of 15.3% was achieved in comparison with 13.8% for pure TiO2 electrode mainly owing to an enhancement in FF. Electron injection from the perovskite photoactive layer improves in the presence of graphene. Hysteresis reduction was observed in TiO2/graphene-based porous electrode. Interface engineering in the organometal halide PSCs is a well-organized means to improve the performance and stability of PV devices. Tavakoli et al.208 used the monolayer graphene (MLG) at the interface of ZnO ETL and perovskite absorber layer, which leads to a PCE of 19.81% and enhancement in photovoltaic performance and stability. PSCs based on the improved ETL was maintained at greater than 80% of the early PCE value over 300 h under light, reflecting its remarkable stability. The carrier extraction and photovoltaic properties improve because of the presence of MLG at the ETL/perovskite interface. Also, the perovskite film is kept from disintegration at high temperatures. To expand the stability even more, using a new modulator, the perovskite surface film improved. A stable PSC device with a PCE of 21% and negligible hysteresis was achieved under 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). The passivated device on MLG/ZnO retained 93% of its early PCE value after 300 h under light.
Meng et al.209 developed a robust ETL constructed by incorporating edge-enriched GNRs into TiO2 paste to produce a good-quality ETL for the cheap production of mesostructured PSCs with improved performance. By introducing GNRs into ETLs, the conductivity greatly improved. The GNRs-incorporated TiO2 showed a small absorption in the visible region compared with the TiO2 ETL. GNRs exhibited an optimal work function compared with the FTO substrate and the conduction band (CB) of TiO2. GNRs were able to facilitate cascade interfacial charge transfer from TiO2 to GNRs to FTO in mesoporous PSCs, which can lead to an increase in the shunt resistance and slowed charge recombination. Mesoporous PSCs with GNRs (i.e., 1.3 wt%) addition into MAPbI3 as the perovskite photoactive layer presented an improved PCE of 17.69%, a steady-state efficiency of 17.05%, and a reduced hysteresis. High amount of GNRs is necessary to hinder the charge extraction process and block the direct contact between the perovskite and TiO2. The performance enhancement of PSCs with GNRs-incorporated ETL is due to the following reasons.
(1) The FF and VOC increase due to the improvement of the electron diffusion coefficient and electron transport time.
(2) Because of the effective cascade charge transfer from TiO2 to GNRs and to the FTO electrode. The charge collection efficiency increases, leading to higher external quantum efficiency and JSC and higher PCE.
(3) Due to the large electron transport time, the J–V hysteresis is significantly suppressed; hence, the charges at the ETL/FTO interface can be readily transferred and extreme charge accumulation in the perovskite can be prevented.
(4) Mesoporous PSC employing GNRs-incorporated ETL demonstrates a better long-term stability. In principle, the incorporation of GNRs in semiconductors is a simple, feasible, and cheap strategy to efficiently transfer charges in high-efficiency and stable PSCs.
Sidhik et al.210 used graphene nanoplatelets (GnPs) in MAPbI3-based perovskite device. They modified mesoporous TiO2 with GnPs by a solution process. In the existence of GnPs, the morphology and properties of anatase TiO2 layer was altered. By the introduction of GnPs, interfacial recombination reduced and the charge-carrier transportation improved by modifying the bandgap and passivating the oxygen-based surface defects. On adding 2 wt% GnPs, a PCE of ∼19% was observed in comparison with the reference device with a PCE of ∼15%. Furthermore, the device presented slight hysteresis and enhanced stability. Shen et al.211 designed high-efficiency (>20%) PSCs by a small sheet size of GQDs (<5 nm) on the mesoporous TiO2 with a low-cost and solution-based deposition method (Fig. 15). A PCE of 20.45% was achieved for PSCs with GQDs/TiO2 ETL, which was greater than 18.57% obtained in the absence of GQDs. Furthermore, GQDs reduced the series resistance of the device by decreasing the contact resistance of the perovskite/mesoporous TiO2 interface. Also, by adding GQDs in mesoporous TiO2, electron abstraction and transportation from the perovskite to the mesoporous TiO2 ETL is facilitated.

Nouri et al.212 used an interface engineering approach using NiO/GO and Li-modified GO (GO-Li)/TiOx as hole and electron transporter layers, respectively. The inverted PSCs made with PEDOT:PSS HTL and PCBM ETL were 25% more effective than the cells with NiO/GO HTL and GO-Li ETL. However, the GO/GO-Li-based PSCs devices presented reasonable efficiency, high reproducibility, and slight hysteresis compared to PEDOT:PSS/PCBM-based PSCs. Khan213 examined the performance of PSCs by passivating the perovskite/ETL interface using GnPs. The unpassivated device exhibited a PCE of 10.58%. It became 12.13% for the passivated PSCs due to faster charge transfer at the perovskites/ETL interface, suppression of non-radiative recombination, and longer carrier lifetime of the passivated perovskite thin films.
Zhao et al.214 incorporated the hydrophobic carbonaceous N,N-bis-[2-(ethanoic acid sodium)]-1,4,5,8-naphthalene diimide-graphene into the SnO2 crystal film as the ETL. A high PCE of 20.2% with a high FF of 82% was obtained using SnO2-5% graphene compact ETL and the FA0.75MA0.15Cs0.1PbI2.65Br0.35 perovskite. This is due to the improvement of electron mobility, extraction ability, and the reduction of charge carriers recombination and subsequently an improvement in FF. Zhou et al.215 synthesized GQD/SnO2 composites as effective ETLs. The PSCs based on the SnO2 blended with GQDs with 5 nm diameter (G5@SnO2), which exhibited higher electron mobility, improved film coverage, and well energy level position in comparison with pristine SnO2. A champion PCE of 19.6% and average PCE of 19.0% were achieved for PSCs based on G5@SnO2 ETL. The G5@SnO2-based PSCs attained the best PCE and stabilized PCE of 17.7% and 17.2%, respectively, similar to the highest PCEs documented for devices. Furthermore, the PSCs presented high mechanical durability and retaining over 91% of the initial PCE value after 500 bending cycles. Nouri et al.216 constructed an inverted PSCs under ambient conditions employing GO as a HTL and GO-Li as an ETL, whereas Al was used as a counter electrode (Fig. 16a–c). A maximum PCE of 10.2% was achieved when a Ti-based sol was added on top of the GO-Li layer.

Biccari et al.217 examined the influence of several graphene-based ETLs on the carrier collection efficiency and on the MAPbI3 morphology and quality along the thickness in the sensitized MAPbI3 solar cells. They compared the samples with the ETLs of mesoporous TiO2 (ETL 1), graphene-doped mesoporous TiO2 (G + mesoporous TiO2) (ETL 2), mesoporous TiO2 plus GO-Li interlayer (ETL 3), and G + mesoporous TiO2 plus GO-Li interlayer (ETL 4) (see Fig. 17). The carrier collection efficiency increased using G + mesoporous TiO2 on adding a GO-Li interlayer as ETL with respect to the standard mesoporous TiO2. Also, the perovskite layer fixed in G + mesoporous TiO2 plus GO-Li ETL illustrated a crystalline quality much better than that of the other samples. Regardless of the temperature, the morphology of the perovskite film incorporated in the G + mesoporous TiO2 plus GO-Li ETL was frozen in the tetragonal phase. The graphene-based ETLs could improve both the carrier collection and the crystallinity of the perovskite layer.

Chandrasekhar et al.218 used the spray deposition method for the deposition of ZnO and graphene/ZnO nanocomposite (G/ZnO) films as an ETL. They examined the influence of graphene concentration in the G/ZnO films from 0 to 1 wt% on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. The values of PCEs and JSC increased from 7.01 to 10.34% and 15.54 to 19.97 mA cm−2, respectively, with respect to pristine ZnO with the graphene concentration of 0.75 w% in the G/ZnO films. The superior grains growth of the perovskite thin-film was attained by the graphene network in the nanocomposite. An enhancement in the electron transport/extraction was also observed.
High stability is a key factor for forthcoming PSCs applications. Bi et al.219 designed PSCs with good thermal and light stability by engineering the diffusion process of charge carriers and ions/molecules within PSCs using a nanostructured carbon layer. The diffusion of ions/molecules within PSCs is a vital decomposition process in the device. They used a carbon layer as an ion/molecule blocking and ETL including nitrogen-doped graphene, the fullerene derivative PCBM, and carbon quantum dots between the perovskite layer and the electrode layer. The efficiency of PSCs was stable over 15% after a thermal aging test at 85 °C and over 500 h or 1000 h light soaking. Organic ETL such as PCBM was successfully applied in organic–inorganic hybrid PSCs.220,221 The PCBM was attracted due to its simple and low-temperature production. However, the low EC and electron mobility of PCBM inhibit the development of PSCs. SnO2 was used as an effective ETL for achieving high-performance PSCs. Xie et al.222 added a small amount of GQDs into SnO2 as the ETL for planar n-i-p PSCs. By adding GQDs into SnO2, the photogenerated electrons in GQDs can pass to the CB of SnO2. The transferred electrons can efficiently fill the electron trap states and improve the Fermi level and conductivity of SnO2, which improves the electron abstraction efficiency and decreases the recombination at the ETLs/perovskite interface. A maximum PCE of 20.23% with slight hysteresis was achieved for GQDs/SnO2 ETL-based PSCs. Agresti et al.223 used GO-Li as an interlayer between the perovskite absorber layer and ETL in mesoscopic PSCs to improve the electron extraction from the perovskite into TiO2. The PCE of GO-Li-based PSCs showed a remarkable improvement of 12% with respect to the mesoporous TiO2 reference device (10.3%), mainly owing to (1) the better energy position between GO-Li and the mesoporous TiO2 ETL that protected more effective electron transfer in terms of energy, (2) higher electron extraction rate, and (3) lower trap state density at the TiO2/perovskite interface by adding GO-Li. In addition, owing to the mesoporous TiO2 oxygen vacancies (electron trapping sites) passivation induced by the GO-Li interlayer, the GO-Li-based PSCs revealed longer operational stability. The hysteresis factor reduced by 50% with the insertion of GO-Li in the PSCs structure owing to better interface properties including less electron trapping and faster electron transportation toward the ETL. Agresti et al.224 engineered the interface by adding graphene and related 2D materials into PSCs. A PCE of 18.2% was achieved by doping graphene flakes into mesoporous TiO2 layer (M-TiO2 + G), and inserting GO between the perovskite and HTL (spiro-OMeTAD), resulting in an improvement in the charge-carrier injection/collection compared with traditional PSCs. The stability PSCs increases by the addition of graphene and GO. M-TiO2 + G PSCs demonstrated high stability by retaining more than 88% of the early PCE value after 16 h of the stress test. Moreover, GO-based structures showed improved stability compared with M-TiO2 + G PSCs when they were exposed to prolonged heating at 60 °C. Cho et al.225 investigated the influence of the immersion of RGO flakes into the ETL, perovskite photoactive layer, and HTL of mesoscopic-mixed (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 PSCs. They observed no significant enhancement in the device performance when the RGO is mixed in the HTL (spiro-OMeTAD) or perovskite layers. Highly efficient PSCs with PCE values up to 19.54% were obtained by mixing RGO flakes into lithium bistrifluoromethanesulfonimidate (Li-TFSI)-treated mesoporous-TiO2 ETL compared to the control devices (18.89%). Also, the values VOC and FF parameters increased due to the passivation of traps and improving electron injection by the lithium treatment of the ETL. Rapid electron extraction was obtained within 1 ns in the presence of RGO. Kakavelakis et al.226 added RGO in the PCBM ETL for planar inverted PSCs, resulting in a PCE enhancement of ∼12% with a hysteresis-free PCE of 14.5% with respect to 12.9% for the pristine PCBM-based device (Fig. 18a and b). The conductivity increases by introducing RGO in PCBM ETL, resulting in higher JSC and FF values. Also, by the addition of RGO in PCBM, the surface traps reduce and the perovskite surface passivates, leading to higher Voc and a lesser light soaking. The relaxation process of excited electrons was significantly quicker in RGO-based PSCs compared to the reference devices, indicating that the charge injection rate was quicker. Hence, by doping PCBM ETL with RGO, the stability of the ETL/perovskite interface against photodegradation improves, leading to an improvement of the stability of the RGO-based PSCs.

The electron-transporting materials based on ternary metal oxides are one of the best ETLs for PSCs because the physical and chemical properties are easily tuned by controlling their compositions.201 Mali et al.227 synthesized RGO grafted zinc stannate (Zn2SnO4) (ZSO) scaffold nanofibers as ETL by the electrospinning method for perovskite materials composed of MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 and (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15-based mixed halide PSCs. A PCE of 13.41% was achieved for the optimized PSC having FTO/Blocking-ZSO/RGO-ZSO0.7-MAPb(I1−xBrx)3/PTAA/Au. A VOC of 1.0.36 V, JSC of 19.62 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.66 were achieved under AM 1.5 G sunlight (100 mW cm−2), which was higher than that of Zn2SnO4 nanofibers (PCE = 7.38%)-based PSCs. They used the improved conditions for the (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x (x = 0.15) perovskite. For FTO/Blocking-ZSO/RGO-ZSO0.7-(FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15/PTAA/Au device structure, 17.89% PCE (JSC 22.50 mA cm−2, VOC 1.046 V, FF 0.76%) was observed. The grafting of RGO in the ZSO scaffolds reduced the decay lifetime, which eased the effective electron injection from the perovskite CB to the RGO Fermi level and then to a CB of ZSO compared to bare ZSO ETL. This enhancement is owing to the high conductivity of RGO and grafting with high porosity ZSO.
Tavakoli et al.228 investigated the reaction mechanism between ZnO NPs and MAI at several annealing temperatures and revealed that the perovskite material decomposes to the PbI2 film in the presence of hydroxide groups at the ZnO NPs surface. The reaction rate and the quality of the perovskite film were changed by controlling the annealing temperature. They synthesized a quasi-core-shell structure of ZnO/RGO quantum dots (QDs) and used it as an ETL. RGO passivates the ZnO NPs surface and it also extracts the charge carriers rapidly from the perovskite layer, leading to the reduction of charge carrier recombination. Furthermore, RGO speeds up the electron extraction and transfer in the PSCs due to its high conductivity and perfect band position, resulting in higher current density and performance. Because of the small number of hydroxyl groups in ZnO after its surface modification with RGO, the perovskite material (MAPbI3) showed an excellent stability after annealing at 100 °C. A stable PCE as high as 15.2% and 11.2% was achieved on FTO glass and PET substrates, respectively, for the ZnO/RGO ETL-based PSCs under AM 1.5 G illumination. Tong et al.229 used mesoporous graphene/polymer (mp-GP) thermal composite as an ETL in high-performance MAPbI3 PSCs. The mp-GP-based devices showed a remarkable PCE improvement (∼48%) from 9.3% to 13.8% compared to the reference graphene-based devices. A high electron mobility for mp-GP was produced after coupling RGO with polyaniline polymer due to the intrinsically high EC and large sp2 hybridized surface area of RGO. The mp-GP ETL acted as a stable 3D scaffold to protect the perovskite layer from humidity and reactive interface formation during the high temperature process owing to its chemical inertness and its capability to offer the encapsulation of perovskite crystals, leading to an improved stability of the PSCs. The higher thermal stability of the mp-GP cells was attributed to (1) the protection of the MAPbI3 crystal from moisture by the mp-GP scaffold and (2) high heat transmission coefficient.
Organic ETLs such as PCBM have triggered a large number of studies mainly owing to their low processing temperatures and low-cost production. Nevertheless, they suffer from low electron mobility and low conductivity. Yang et al.230 dispersed GQDs in PCBM ETL-based normal planar MAPbI3 PSCs. By the incorporation of a low concentration of GQDs (0.5 wt%) with 5 nm in diameter, the conductivity of the PCBM improved and the extraction of photogenerated electrons from the photoactive layer into the ETL became easy. The charge accumulated at the interface of the perovskite with decreasing ETL because of the high extraction rate. Also, the PCE of the PSCs increases by 20%. The PCE was maintained beyond 80% after 300 h, while the PCE of the reference cells dropped to less than 50%.
Kim et al.167 utilized fluorine-functionalized graphene nanoplatelets (EFGnPs-F) to obtain excellent stability in planar inverted PSCs. 82% of the original PCE after 30 days under light was maintained. The hydrophobic character of the EFGnPs-F protected the photoactive layer from water and the device stability improved. A larger stability under 50% moisture was obtained as a function of the absorption properties of the EFGnPs-F/MAPbI3 films with respect to the MAPbI3 reference films. The use of the EFGnPs-F interlayer between the PCBM (ETL) and the metal electrode not only increased the moisture stability but also retained the photovoltaic performance with respect to the reference devices. Nouri et al.231 designed functional PSCs by a simple, cheap, and stable soluble tetra-n-butyl-substituted copper phthalocyanine (CuBuPc) as an HTM. They synthesized TiO2/RGO hybrids as an electron acceptor/transport mediators through an in situ solvothermal process for PSCs based on soluble CuBuPc HTM and on GO as a buffer layer. An enhancement in the electron lifetime and recombination resistance were achieved for the device based on a TiO2/RGO mesoporous layer, which led to an increase in the JSC, VOC, and FF. The devices based on the TiO2/RGO mesoporous layer with an optimum RGO of 0.2 wt% presented 22% higher efficiency and higher stability with respect to pristine TiO2-based devices.
In summary, graphene-based ETLs have a significant influence on the stability and PCEs of PSCs. Also, the graphene-based ETLs can act as a rapid extraction layer for electrons and improve the charge injection and/or collection at the electrodes, resulting in a decrease in the charge recombination process. In addition, the insertion of GBNs in ETL can improve the crystalline quality of the perovskite layer.


3.2.3. Hole transport layer. 
The recombination of photogenerated electron/hole at the interfaces of the perovskite photoactive layer with the interlayers limits the efficiency of the PSCs. Charge recombination is a result of imperfect crystallization passivation and interfacial behavior. In fact, it occurs when an electron (or hole) is trapped in a defect. Then, it is combined with a hole (or electron) in the CB of the perovskite. The charge transfer materials and the interface in contact with the perovskite should be stable for the fabrication of PSCs with an excellent stability. The use of spiro-OMeTAD as HTM is an innovation in the PSCs. The appropriate choice of HTMs is a main issue for an effective charge abstraction and stability in solar cells. Spiro-OMeTAD is the most appropriate HTM for PSCs owing to its easy work and good performance. However, spiro-OMeTAD is under debate due to its cost, stability, decomposition issues induced by temperature, additives, film quality, coating technologies compatibility, dependence on additives, and hysteresis.232 The lack of reproducibility in these devices stems partly from the low intrinsic hole-mobility and conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD due to its hygroscopic and corrosive behavior as well as the need to dope the HTM p-type to improve its hole-mobility and conductivity.233 Lithium salts as additives in spiro-OMeTAD are the most efficient p-dopants and improve the conductivity and hole mobility by rapidly reacting with oxygen and oxidizing spiro-OMeTAD. Spiro-OMeTAD doped with Li-TFSI as HTL degrades the perovskite to lead iodide (PbI2) due to its hygroscopic nature by introducing moisture into the perovskite layer. Other dopants such as tert-butyl pyridine corrode the perovskite absorption layers and eventually damage the PSCs stability. Also, the PSCs performance may be harmed due to the high density of pinholes on the spiro-OMeTAD surface films when chlorobenzene solvent is used, and the films are exposed to high temperatures through the fabrication process. To address the obstacles, GBNs have been successfully applied in PSCs. Graphene as a moisture-resistant layer enhances the device's lifetime and overcomes instability issues in PSC devices. GBNs could be used as an alternative to spiro-OMeTAD because of the structure's unique properties such as high carrier mobility at room temperature, high transparency, high TC, and high melting point (approximately 5000 K).234 The outstanding properties of GBNs or bilayer HTLs such as low temperature solution processability, high EC, and high material stability improve the efficiency and stability of the solar cells compared to the single layer HTL. Also, the GBNs improve the morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite film. Interface engineering of the PSCs is very important for achieving high PCE. Mann et al.235 prepared an efficient planar PSCs with a bilayer containing of PEDOT:PSS and sulfonic acid-functionalized graphene oxide (SrGO) as a hole interfacial layer. The incorporation of SrGO improved the efficiency and stability of planar PSCs. A higher PCE of 16.01% was achieved for the planar PSCs with PEDOT:PSS/SrGO HTL than those of the single PEDOT:PSS (13.5%) and SrGO (11.66%) HTL. The enhanced PCE performance in the PEDOT:PSS/SrGO HTL-based planar PSCs mainly originated from better energy levels matching, lower recombination, and improved charge transport. The PEDOT:PSS/SrGO HTL-based devices presented an excellent long-term stability with respect to the PEDOT:PSS single-layer devices. The hydrophilic and high acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS resulted in the destruction of the ITO electrode and perovskite, which reduced the stability and performance of PSCs. Khorshidi et al.236 used new types of hydrophobic GQDs (HGQDs) containing amide linkages and consisted of carbonyl and dodecyl amine groups as the bifunctional interface between the perovskite film and HTL. The engineered PSCs' interface displayed a much-enhanced stability in ambient conditions. The value of the PCE increased from 16.0% for the reference to 18.3% for the modified PSC.
In general, the perovskite layer is simply decomposed by oxygen and moisture. The graphene sheet can prevent the diffusion of small molecules such as oxygen, hydrogen, and water to the perovskite layer because of its hydrophobicity and chemical inertness properties. Najafi et al.237 used graphene and GBNs as remarkable candidates to tune the “on-demand” interface properties of PSCs. They exploited molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and RGO hybrids as HTL and photoactive buffer layer in mesoscopic MAPbI3-based PSCs (Fig. 19). The van der Waals hybridization of MoS2 QDs with functionalized reduced graphene oxide (f-RGO) was achieved through the chemical silanization-induced linkage between RGO and (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane. The zero-dimensional MoS2 QDs derived by liquid phase exfoliated MoS2 flakes provide both hole-extraction and electron-blocking properties, which are the most important requirements for HTL. MAPbI3-based PSCs based on MoS2 QDs/f-RGO/spiro-OMeTAD HTL obtained a PCE up to 20.12% (average PCE of 18.8%). Hence, the graphene interface engineering strategy is a remarkable method for the expansion of next-generation PSCs. PEDOT:PSS and GO as well as their hybrids are extensively utilized to fabricate HTL for inverted planar PSCs. However, their acidic nature is unfavorable for the stability of PSCs.

Ahmad et al.238 incorporated RGO with spiro-OMeTAD (RGO + spiro-OMeTAD) as the HTL to improve the stability of PSCs. The fabricated PSCs (ITO/SnO2/MAPbI3/RGO + spiro-OMeTAD/Au) revealed good efficiency (11.18%) compared to the control device (10.22%) (ITO/SnO2/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au). Also, the stability of RGO + spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs improved in the presence of RGO. The efficiency of the modified devices retained more than 58.14% of its initial efficiency after 500 h. However, the efficiency of the control device decreased from 10.22 to 4.40% and 43% efficiency was retained after 500 h. Wang et al.239 used a simple approach to fabricate non-corrosive HTL by treating GO and PEDOT:PSS with ammonia or ammonium (i.e., (NH4)2HPO4), respectively. The PSCs based on ammonia-treated GO yields a PCE more than 14%, outperforming those with pristine GO (∼12%) or PEDOT:PSS (∼13%). A similar improvement was also reported for the devices with ammonia or ammonium-treated PEDOT:PSS. The devices based on ammonia-treated HTL exhibited significantly better stability in comparison with pristine PEDOT:PSS and GO. Nouri et al.240 prepared a NiOx-GO hybrid HTM by a solution-processed method for PSCs with either gold or carbon as the back-contact electrode. They examined the influence of GO content on the optoelectronic behavior of NiOx and the photovoltaic performance of the devices. An important enhancement in the performance of the NiOx-based devices was obtained with the incorporation of GO. The maximum PCE for the NiOx-GO/Au-based devices was 13.3%, which was 45% higher than those of pure NiOx. The enhancement in the PCE of the NiOx-GO/Au-based devices was ascribed to an important enhancement in the hole extraction, recombination resistance, and energy-level matching compared with pure NiOx. Furthermore, a slight hysteresis effect and high reliability and repeatability were achieved for NiOx-GO/Au-based devices. When carbon was used as the back-contact electrode in devices, the best PCE was 7.1%. The PSCs based on inorganic NiOx or NiOx-GO HTLs presented higher stability in air compared with a cell that used spiro-OMeTAD as HTL. Jokar et al.241 used GO and RGO as a HTL for high-performance inverted planar heterojunction PSCs. The RGO-based devices showed PCE exceeding 16% than those made by GO (13.8%) and PEDOT:PSS (14.8%) films with an excellent stability and reproducibility. A PCE of 13.8% was achieved for flexible RGO device. They retained 70% of the initial PCE after continuous bending for more than 150 cycles. The hole-extraction period was much smaller for the GO/MAPbI3 film than for other RGO/MAPbI3 films. Also, a quick charge recombination occurred at the perovskite/GO interfaces, which decreased the performance of the GO device compared with the RGO device. Yang et al.242 controlled the thickness of the GO treated with the solution and obtained an equilibrium between high work function and conductivity. Utilizing the optimized GO as the HTM in PSCs, a high PCE of 16.5% with no hysteresis and an outstanding light-soaking photocurrent stability was achieved in comparison with frequently used organic-based HTM. Under high moisture and light soaking, the encapsulated perovskite devices retained over 80% of their early efficiency for more than 2000 h. Yu et al.243 examined the influence of the bi-interlayer consisting of water-free PEDOT:PSS and fluorinated reduced graphene oxide (FrGO) as the HTL on the efficiency and stability of the normal-structure PSCs. Using the water-free PEDOT:PSS/FrGO HTL, the PSCs displayed a significantly improved PCE of 14.9% compared to the control devices based on single PEDOT:PSS HTL. The improved PCE was mostly because of the reduction in charge carrier recombination in the devices. This is due to the interfacial dipoles at the PEDOT:PSS/FrGO interface with favorable direction, which simplifies the electron blocking and higher potential in the devices. Moreover, the device based on the bilayer HTL PEDOT:PSS + FrGO revealed an improved stability by retaining 70% of the original PCE for more than 30 days. Due to the hydrophobic character of the graphitic sheets of the FrGO on the PEDOT:PSS, the perovskite films were protected against moisture and oxygen penetration. Therefore, using the composite interfacial layers such as graphene derivatives can be an actual and useful approach for high-performance, stable, and cheap PSCs. Guo et al.244 prepared a sulfated graphene oxide (sGO)-PEDOT:PSS composite HTL. They also used PEDOT:PSS and GO as the HTL for inverted planar PSCs. The PSCs based on PETDOT:PSS HTL and GO exhibited a PCE of 9.0 to 11.5% and average of ∼10.3% and 4.3%, respectively. However, the PSCs based on 1:1 sGO-PEDOT:PSS HTL demonstrated a thin PCE with a efficiency of 13.0%. The modification of HTLs is an actual method to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of PSCs. Zhang et al.245 synthesized a highly-dispersed graphene composite using synergistic π–π interactions between the graphene sheets and functional carbon nanotubes (f-CNTs). Graphene:f-CNTs were used as HTLs, which demonstrated an outstanding conductivity and hole mobility. A PCE of 14.8% was attained with substantial reproducibility. The excellent stability and performance in the presence of graphene was achieved. Zhou et al.246 introduced a low-temperature-processed RGO/PTAA bilayer into both flexible and rigid inverted planar PSCs with a structure of substrate/ITO/RGO/polytriarylamine/MAPbI3/PCBM/BCP/Ag. They obtained PCEs of 15.7 and 17.2%, respectively. Furthermore, the PSC-based bilayer had great light-soaking stability by obtaining ∼90% of its original efficiency after illumination for 500 h at 100 mW cm−2.
The PSCs with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS-GO:NH3/MAPbI3−xClx/PCBM/(solution Bphen)sBphen/Ag were prepared by Feng et al.164 By introducing an ammonia-modified GO (GO:NH3) layer into the planar PSCs, the performance and perovskite structure stability improved significantly. Devices with a champion PCE up to 16.11% were greater in comparison with all the reference devices without the GO:NH3 layer. The improvements were due to the improvement of (1) crystallization and favorite alignment order of the perovskite structure, (2) morphology with approximately whole coverage, (3) optical absorption produced by the PEDOT:PSS-GO:NH3 layer, and (4) matched energy-level-alignment at the perovskite interface. Also, the structural stability of the perovskite film was improved by the PEDOT:PSS-GO:NH3 composite film, which results in more stable PSCs. The stability of PSCs is one of the chief difficulties that should be tested.
Palma et al.247 used RGO as the HTM in PSCs. A PCE of 6.6% was attained with respect to the spiro-OMeTAD (PCE = 6.5%) after the shelf-life test. The good durability of RGO-based PSCs compared with the spiro-OMeTAD was confirmed by the light soaking test. The latter showed a reduction in the PCE by about 2.7 times than the RGO-based cells. Chen et al.248 used the oxo-functionalized graphene (oxo-G1) to replace hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS as an anode interfacial layer in PSCs. The planar inverted architecture with oxo-G1 as a HTM exhibited a reasonably high PCE of 15.2% and VOC of up to 1.1 V. Also, oxo-G1 HTM significantly improved the stability of the unpackaged cells by decreasing the diffusion of the water vapor into the device stack. The unpackaged cells retained 80% of their original PCE under white light illumination after 500 h. Also, they obtained ∼60% of their initial PCE after ∼1000 h of light soaking under 0.5 sun at 30 °C. Also, the unsealed solar cells retained 92% of its initial PCE after about 1900 h at a temperature of about 15–25 °C and a relative moisture between 30 and 50% and in the dark. A critical step for prolonged environmental stability is due to the control of water diffusion into the PSCs through advanced interface engineering. Gatti et al.249 fabricated the PSCs by single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) hybrid by a poly (3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) matrix containing organic functional groups and RGO as a HTM. PCEs of 11% and 7.3% were achieved over 480 h for SWCNTs-P3HT- and RGO-P3HT-based PSCs, respectively. The obtained PCE were higher with respect to PSCs prepared by a bare P3HT HTM (PCE = 4.3% at 480 h). By retaining the PSCs in dark conditions for 3240 h of aging, the PSCs based on 2 wt% SWCNT-doped P3HT as HTM showed a PCE of ∼8.7%. The enhancement in the photovoltaic performance and stability of the P3HT–CNS–based PSCs compared to the standard P3HT-based PSCs are related to the better interfacial contacts between the doped HTM and the adjacent layers.
Hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskites appeared at the front of the solution-processable photovoltaic devices. Giuri et al.250 improved the wettability of MAPbI3 onto PEDOT:PSS HTL utilizing the cooperative effect of GO and glucose inclusion. Glucose molecule has triple roles of reducing GO, increasing the substrate wettability of PEDOT:PSS because of several hydroxyl group terminations and increasing the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS + GO + glucose-based nanocomposite. Hysteresis-free MAPbI3 solar cells displayed ∼37% enhancement in the PCE in comparison with a device grown onto pristine PEDOT:PSS. The value of VOC (1.05 V) improved due to the reduction in recombination losses and trap density at the PEDOT:PSS with enhanced MAPbI3 coverage and great hole-selectivity. Huang et al.251 used the RGO/PEDOT:PSS layer as the HTL in PSCs. The combination of RGO into the PEDOT:PSS layer almost did not vary its transparency, hydrophilic character, or surface roughness. PSCs with RGO/PEDOT:PSS as HTL showed an improvement in PCE by 22% compared with the PSCs with pristine PEDOT:PSS as the HTL. Lee et al.252 examined the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite as a suitable choice for the application of 2D carbonaceous HTL to planar heterojunction PSCs. The device with GO and PEDOT:PSS HTLs exhibited a low PCE of 6.4% and 8.2%, respectively. Alternatively, the PSCs with the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HTL showed a higher PCE of 9.7%. The superior performance of the composite with respect to single GO and conventional PEDOT:PSS HTLs may be attributed to decreased series resistance and increased shunt resistance. More effective charge transport and overall reduction in the series resistance is probably due to the well-matched work function between GO (4.9 eV) and PEDOT:PSS (5.1 eV). Also, GO with a large bandgap of ∼3.6 eV could induce the actual blocking of electrons, resulting in an increase in the shunt resistance. Furthermore, the PSCs based on the GO/PEDOT:PSS composite HTL showed better long-term stability under the ambient condition. GO and PEDOT:PSS hybrid bilayer were used as HTLs for MAPbI3-based inverted planar heterojunction PSCs. By introducing GO, the leakage current is suppressed and recombination reduces through effective hole transport and electron blocking with 30% enhancement of PCE.253 Kim et al.254 prepared nitrogen-doped graphene oxide nanoribbons (NGONRs) as a HTL in PSCs. A photoactive layer film with wide-ranging surface coverage and larger hole selectivity was obtained due to the outstanding wetting of the perovskite precursor solution on the NGONR layer, leading to facilitate hole transport from the perovskite to the FTO anode. The device with NGONRs HTL exhibited an efficiency over 12% greater than that of the device prepared with PEDOT:PSS HTL. Small current hysteresis irrespective of scanning direction and sweeping rates was observed when the device was fabricated with NGONRs. Also, NGONRs improved the device stability in air compared to PEDOT:PSS HTL. Wang et al.255 demonstrated that a SWCNTs/GO buffer layer remarkably improves the photovoltaic performance of organo-lead iodide PSCs. The CNTs/GO buffer layer acted as an efficient hole transport/electron blocking layer. The photovoltaic conversion efficiency of 13.3% was attained in the organo-lead iodide PSCs because of the CNTs and GO properties. An amino-rich graphene (NGs) was presented as an interlayer at the perovskite/HTM interface by Wen et al.256 to reduce the surface trap states of the perovskite and also to enhance the hole control of the dopant-free spiro-OMeTAD. Graphene could act as an effective hole abstraction and transfer trajectory through the HTM network. A maximum PCE of 14.6% was attained with an extraordinary improvement of 36% with respect to the control device (10.7%). The enhancement in the performance efficiency of the PSCs based on NGs was mostly ascribed to the increase in the JSC and FF. Ye et al.257 employed a highly dispersed functional graphene (F-graphene) to modify P3HT as the HTL for PSCs. The hole mobility and conductivity were remarkably enhanced by introducing F-graphene. The PSC with F-graphene/P3HT HTL achieved PCEs of up to 13.82%. Moreover, due to the good hydrophobicity of the P3HT/graphene layer, excellent stability of the devices was obtained. To mitigate the degradation of PSCs caused by the direct contact of the metal electrode and perovskites, inserting other layers between them is one of the most effective approaches. Grätzel et al.258 fabricated the PSCs with the configuration of FTO/TiO2/perovskite/CuSCN/Au. They demonstrated that CuSCN as HTL has efficient hole extraction and collection properties. The PSC devices represented an over 20% PCE, whereas the efficient PSCs exhibited poor stability due to the reaction between Au and thiocyanate anions. The corresponding device exhibited an excellent operational stability under full-sun illumination at 60 °C by inserting a thin RGO spacer layer between CuSCN and Au. Also, the device retained over 95% of its initial PCE after 1000 h. The RGO layer acted as an encapsulation and protection layer for the CuSCN/perovskite layers and the potential-induced reaction, which occurred between the CuSCN and Au layers.

3.3. Encapsulation layer
Although PSCs have revealed a rapid increase in PCE over the past few years, their commercialization is mainly limited by their poor long-term environmental stability. This instability can originate from the instability of the most commonly used perovskite materials as electrodes, HTLs, and ETLs upon exposure to heat, UV radiation, oxygen, or moisture. To address these obstacles, controlling the internal degradation mechanism is vital by suitable choices of stable electrodes, charge transport layers, and active layers. The encapsulation of devices is another promising approach to enhance the long-term environmental stability of PSCs against direct exposure to UV radiation, heat, or moisture.259–262 GBNs can be used as encapsulants because of their hydrophobicity and high TC. GBNs can efficiently block moisture or oxygen in the surrounding environment and dissipate heat through the encapsulation layer. Hence, the device temperature decreases during operation.262 Han et al.263 encapsulated PSCs by the spin-coating of poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)/RGO. The devices encapsulated with PMMA/RGO retained 90% of their initial PCE even after 500 h under extreme humidity (>75%), whereas the devices encapsulated only by PMMA degraded after 100 h. Also, PMMA/RGO-passivated PSCs displayed a negligible change in the efficiency at 35 °C and humidity of 40% for 1000 h. The superior protection performance of the PMMA/RGO is attributed to enhanced hydrophobicity and increased complexity of the O2 or H2O diffusion pathways in the presence of RGO, which can block the diffusion of external molecules and promotes heat dissipation. Cao et al.264 fabricated efficient and hysteresis-free PSCs with ZnO as the ETL and graphene encapsulation layer, which are stable in air. The encapsulated PSCs retained over 90% of their original efficiency after 350 h, whereas the reference cells lost ∼80% of their efficiency within 40 h. The PSCs with graphene encapsulation layer displayed long-term stability against humidity and heat by creating a fully hydrophobic and heat-conducting layer over the devices. Yi et al.265 introduced a highly flexible and stable PSCs that was encapsulated by graphene layers. The stability of graphene-encapsulated PSCs significantly improved compared with reference cells and the graphene device retained 95 and 82.4% of its initial efficiency after 100 and 3700 h at 85–90% relative humidity and air, respectively.
4. Challenges and outlook in the potential industrial applications of graphene-based PSCs
PSCs are one of the best renewable technologies for next power generators. However, for commercializing them, there are serious challenges in their performance in terms of stability, scalability, flexibility, toxicity, and cost. Toward commercialization, the fabrication of low cost, highly efficient, and stable PSCs without I–V hysteresis is of great importance.266 GBNs such as GO, RGO, nitrogen-doped graphene, and GQDs have been used in PSCs to address these challenges. These materials have been used in the PSCs as conductive electrodes, the photoactive layer including light harvesting materials, i.e., perovskite layer and carrier transport layers such as electron transport layer and interfaces, hole transport layer and interfaces, and encapsulation layer because of their excellent optical, electronic, thermal, photonic, and mechanical properties, together with their low cost, solution-processability, and less impact on the environment. Also, the high optical transparency, high electrical conductivity, and selective charge carriers' blocking capability, and the unique 2D packed network, chemical inertness, and hydrophobicity of GBNs facilitate their use as TCEs, charge transport layers, and encapsulation layer in PSCs.267 Hence, they can increase the lifetime and stability and improve the performance of PSCs through several strategies including interfacial, defect, compositional engineering, and encapsulation. In fact, the incorporation of GBNs has the following advantages.16
(1) Improving the PSCs stability and boosting the crystallization resulted in preferred orientations, longer crystal grain sizes, and few pinholes on the perovskite crystal at low temperatures.
(2) Enhancing the morphology of the perovskite film and providing sufficient surface coverage of the perovskite film.
(3) Facilitating charge extraction from the perovskite layer toward the ETL and HTL and faster transfer of electrons and holes by inserting GBNs interlayers between ETL and HTL and the corresponding electrodes.
(4) Increasing the charge blocking ability of the interlayer in which it is incorporated.
(5) Creating highly conductive, transparent, and flexible substrates.
(6) Preventing considerable extrinsic degradation arises from metal intrusion into the perovskite at high temperatures, resulting in an improvement in stability.
(7) Protecting the perovskite film from harmful UV or moisture/oxygen.
(8) Making less pronounced hysteresis.
(9) The perovskite structure degrades under humidity and heat. For addressing this obstacle, GBNs can be used as an encapsulation layer because of their excellent hydrophobicity and TC.262
Thus, graphene-based PSCs display high efficiencies (>20%), low costs, good reproducibility, and stability, which are promising prospects for the creation of a novel technology.30
Although GBNs can improve the performance of PSCs for advancing their commercial applications by various roles, there are still several challenges, which are as follows.
(1) Long-term stability is still a serious challenge limiting the commercialization of graphene-based PSCs due to several following reasons:
(i) GBNs are not directly suitable for solution-processed applications.74 They should be modified by introducing some functional groups as well as exfoliation before their use in PSCs.
(ii) These nanomaterials are nonstoichiometric compounds.74 In other words, they have no specific chemical empirical formulae, which limit the full understanding of the process of improvement of PSCs.
(iii) Smart selection and the right number of functional groups or dopants for the GBNs are very vital. In general, the functional groups or dopants may affect their bandgap, lateral sheet size, morphology, number of monolayers, type, and concentration defects. This in turn affects the performance of the PSCs. For example, the functional groups or dopants affect the conductivity of GBNs. The functionalization of graphene with atoms having great electronegativity may be a suitable way.16
(iv) Perovskite is an economical constituent in PSCs. On the other hand, other components of PSCs are so expensive. The synthesis of low-cost, defect-free, large-scale, tunable size, and excellent quality GBNs is a very challenging task.268 In this regard, the control of preparation parameters such as temperature and pH are of great importance. The preparation of these nanomaterials using an inkjet printer with a suitable solvent is suggested.
(2) The exact determination of thickness of the GBNs by novel techniques is very important since it affects the device performance. For example, the thickness of the inkjet-printed graphene thin films can be measured accurately by the surface plasmon resonance technique.
(3) It is essential to develop tailored protocols for PSCs based on GBNs from the vast body of data accumulated from systematic research on device stability under a variety of environmental and operational conditions and cost.58
(4) The interaction of GBNs with perovskites is not strong. To improve the interaction, graphene should be functionalized with appropriate chemical groups.259
(5) One of the major obstacles for commercializing PSCs is their poor operational stability, which is related to the intrinsic degradation of perovskite and HTL induced by metal-perovskite reactions and migration of additives in the HTM layer, respectively. To improve the stability, GBNs have been successfully used as HTMs and spacer layer in PSCs.260,261
(6) The commercialization of PSCs is hindered by several factors including their poor long-term operational stability, high toxicity of lead (Pb), and use of expensive materials, e.g., spiro-OMeTAD and gold or silver as the HTL and top electrode, respectively. Thus, the development of novel, low-cost, abundant, and environment-friendly materials with facile fabrication procedures is essential to enhance the PCE, long-term environmental stability, and cost effectiveness of PSCs. In this regard, GBNs are suitable candidates to overcome the challenge of poor long-term stability. This is due to their superior stability, nontoxicity, and remarkable optoelectronic properties.262
5. Conclusion
The optoelectronic properties of PSCs, such as high absorption coefficient with long carrier diffusion lengths, high ambipolar charge transfer ability, low recombination loss, low exciton binding energy, and high carrier mobility have advanced the research field targeting low-cost and high-efficiency solar cells.269 However, there are several challenges to the commercialization of PSCs, including environmental stability (moisture, oxygen, and temperature),270–272 hysteresis behavior and transient current–voltage,74 poor UV tolerance,270 toxicity, low to medium photovoltaic performance,16 precise control thin film growth and deposition, photodegradation, and scalability.16,74,268,270,273 Also, most high-performance PSCs are based on expensive materials, such as spiro-OMeTAD, gold, and silver as the HTL and top electrode. GBNs have been widely used as low-cost alternatives in PSCs due to their superior stability and excellent optoelectronic properties.262 For example, GBNs such as GO, RGO, nitrogen-doped graphene, and GQDs are utilized as the conductive electrodes, photoactive layer, carrier transport layers and interfaces, and encapsulation layer due to their outstanding properties, including high carrier mobility, low resistivity, high transmittance, and packed 2D network.234 The incorporation of GBNs in the perovskite layer, ETL and interfaces, HTL, and interfaces has several advantages, including refining the stability, increasing perovskite grain size, such as sufficient surface coverage of the perovskite film, improving the morphology of the perovskite film, facilitating the charge extraction from the perovskite photoactive layer to the ETL and HTL, and supporting more uniform deposition of the perovskite film on graphene-based transport layers.274 For this reason, some main graphene fabrication methods, including graphite exfoliation, GO reduction, CVD, and epitaxial growth were described. However, one of the key factors to achieve better performance of PSCs is the preparation-tailored properties of GBNs. For example, conductive graphene is suitable for TCEs applications, whereas the hybrid of GBNs with metal oxides, metals, and conducting polymers is appropriate for charge-selective components and electrode interlayer materials. GBNs have the potential to replace conventional transparent conductive oxide such as ITO or FTO. Regardless of the remarkable progress in graphene-based PSCs, there are challenges that need to be addressed in the future. One of the main challenges is the large-scale production of excellent quality graphene compounds with suitable thickness, transmittance, conductivity, and bandgap. To achieve further success in the implementation of GBNs, new layered graphene materials and the development of different PSCs layer designs with controlled mechanisms are needed.
The present review is an inclusive overview of the use of GBNs as conductive electrodes, in photoactive layer including light harvesting materials, i.e., perovskite layer, carrier transport layers such as ETL and interfaces, HTL, and interface, and encapsulation layer of PSCs. The integration of various factors that affect the performance of PCSs was also discussed. Other applications of graphene-based compounds in other fields, including freshwater production, energy, and environment, are briefly considered.
