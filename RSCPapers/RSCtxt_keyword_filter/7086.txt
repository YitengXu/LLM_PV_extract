    , Accepted 11th November 2022First published on 12th November 2022AbstractHerein, we present a D–A–D type organic semiconductor with a bipyridine core for constructing an efficient tunnel between perovskite and a hole transporting layer to obtain high-performance PSCs. This molecule could facilitate the band bending of perovskite to construct energy level alignment. Moreover, its bipyridine core also passivates the uncoordinated Pb2+ defects of perovskite films. Hence, the hole mobility of the hole transporting layer is increased by 7 times, from 1.05 × 10−4 to 8.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the hole defect density is decreased by 41%, from 4.42 × 1015 to 2.63 × 1015 cm−3 after introducing this hole transporting tunnel. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of n–i–p structured PSCs increases from 20.2% to 22.4% with improved stability.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved worldwide attention and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has exceeded 25%1,2 with conventional 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD, abbreviated as Spiro) as a hole transporting material. However, the application of Spiro still meets some challenges such as its complex synthetic procedure, poor stability, and large energy loss.3–5 The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level (EHOMO = −5.20 eV)6,7 of Spiro is much higher than the valence band level (VB) of perovskite (−5.75 eV), which influences the hole extraction efficiency and induces a large open-circuit voltage loss (Voc). To address these issues, researchers have developed various suitable hole-transporting materials,8–10 or have introduced materials with appropriate HOMO energy levels between the hole transporting (HTL) layer and perovskite to regulate the energy levels.11–15 The organic molecules which are used as the interfacial passivation layer have great potential to address the defects of the perovskite and to facilitate carrier extraction.16 In particular, organic semiconductors have been explored in the surface modification of perovskite to eliminate any deleterious defects. Hence, introducing an organic semiconductor that has hole transport ability between the perovskite and the HTL to construct an efficient tunnel for hole transport is important.
Besides the optimization of the energy levels, minimizing the undesired defects of perovskite film is equally crucial to restrict charge recombination. At present, various defect passivating agents, such as polymers,17–19 small molecules,20–23 and organic/inorganic salts24–26 have been extensively investigated for PSCs. In particular, pyridine and thiophene-based organic small molecules, which contain electron-rich nitrogen/sulfur atoms, are effective for interacting with uncoordinated Pb2+ to restrict charge recombination.27–31 Bipyridine as a planar molecule with an electron-withdrawing ability can construct the energy level alignment and passivate the uncoordinated Pb2+ of perovskite to improve the charge extraction and the transport properties.32,33 Simultaneously, some hole transport materials with good hole-extraction and hole-transport abilities based on bipyridine34–36 such as F22 and F23, have been designed for PSCs to improve the device performance. However, the PCE of F22/F23-based devices is still lower than that of doped Spiro devices.
Herein, we introduced a molecular semiconductor 4,4′-([2,2′-bipyridine]-4,4′-diyl)bis(N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)aniline) (termed 4-BA) with bipyridine as a core unit into the interlayer of perovskite and the HTL, to passivate the unavoidable defects in perovskites as well as to construct a hole transport tunnel and energy level alignment. The suitable energy level alignment would cooperate with an efficient hole transport tunnel to improve device performance. The N atom on the bipyridine would also effectively interact with uncoordinated Pb2+ and passivating defects, restricting charge recombination. Meanwhile, the benzene ring in the 4-BA may form π–π stacking with Spiro, which can shorten the diffusion distance of the carrier and facilitate the hole extraction and transfer, as well as decrease the electron–hole recombination at the interface.37 The total hole mobility is increased by seven times in comparison with the doped Spiro. This enables the device efficiency to improve from 20.2% to 22.4% with good stability.
Results and discussion
The 4-BA with a π-conjugated structure and hydrophobic groups that can be used as a hole transporting tunnel for PSCs was synthesised by a simple synthetic route (Fig. 1(a) and (b)). It was synthesized by a Suzuki coupling reaction of 4,4′-dibromo-2,2′-bipyridine with 4-methoxy-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)aniline and the detailed synthetic procedure is shown in the ESI.† The structure of the compound was characterized by spectroscopic methods (Fig. S1–S3, ESI†). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to evaluate the molecular geometries and the frontier molecular orbitals of 4-BA. The HOMO of 4-BA is concentrated on the triphenylamine (TPA) moieties, while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is mainly localized on the bipyridine core and is partially delocalized to the donor unit (Fig. 1(b)). The efficient separation of the HOMO and LUMO facilitates efficient charge transfer.38 An electrostatic potential (ESP) analysis was performed to understand the charge distribution and to evaluate the possible site of interaction with the defects on the perovskite (Fig. 1(b)). The bipyridine core exhibit a high electron density, which can potentially act as a Lewis base to passivate the perovskite surface defects.

The energy levels and band gaps of 4-BA were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and optical absorption. The optical characteristics of 4-BA solution in dichloromethane were measured by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 2(a)). The absorption peak located at the range of 360–380 nm is mainly attributed to a π–π* transition derived from the TPA unit.39 The optical bandgap of 4-BA was further calculated from the UV-vis absorption edge to be 2.92 eV (Eg = 1240/λonset). The CV curves of 4-BA and ferrocene solution in dichloromethane are displayed in Fig. 2(b) (detailed data are shown in Table S1, ESI†). 4-BA has a quasi-reversible redox potential and the HOMO energy level is −5.37 eV which is calculated according to the equation: EHOMO = −(5.11 + Eox − EFc/Fc+), which lies between perovskite (−5.75 eV) and Spiro (−5.20 eV).40 According to the ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg equation, the LUMO energy level of 4-BA is −2.45 eV. The LUMO level of 4-BA is high enough to prevent the flowing back of electrons from the perovskite to the gold electrode. Meanwhile, the suitable HOMO–LUMO energy level leads to the well-matched energy level alignment between perovskite and the HTL for reducing Voc loss of the PSCs (Fig. 2(c)). Moreover, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was employed to evaluate the energy band of the Cs0.05FA0.95MA0.05PbI3 perovskite (shown in Fig. S4, ESI†). The valence band maximum of the perovskite film moves from −5.75 eV to −5.30 eV after treatment by 4-BA. It indicates that 4-BA constructs an energy level alignment to lessen the energy loss.

Moreover, the thermal stability of the molecule has been evaluated. The decomposition temperature (Td) and the glass transition temperature (Tg) of 4-BA are 420 °C and 127 °C by thermogravimetric (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis, respectively (see Fig. 2(d) and Fig. S5, ESI†). A high thermal stability could maintain a stable morphology during operation and further improve device stability. Photoluminescence (PL), confocal PL mapping, and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) were carried out to analyze the carrier-dynamic properties of the perovskite film. Compared with the bare perovskite, the film with 4-BA showed a weaker PL intensity and darker confocal PL mapping (Fig. 3(a) and Fig. S6, ESI†).41 It indicates that there is a faster hole extraction at the PVK/4-BA interface relative to perovskite (PVK), and Kelvin probe force microscopy(KPFM) was applied to examine the effect of 4-BA on the surface potential. The potential of the perovskite surface with 4-BA (∼838 mV) is higher than the pristine perovskite surface (∼133 mV, Fig. 3(e)). Meanwhile, when Spiro was introduced on top of PVK/4-BA, stronger fluorescence quenching and a shorter carrier lifetime were observed (Fig. 3(b) and (c)). The TRPL curves are fitted to estimate the lifetime of the carriers and the average lifetime of the PVK/4-BA/Spiro film is 3.86 ns, which is much shorter than the PVK/Spiro film (10.64 ns) and the perovskite film (20.51 ns). The shorter lifetime of the sample with 4-BA is attributed to a well-matched energy alignment and to efficient hole transport. The hole mobility was further verified by a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement of Spiro with/without the 4-BA based on a hole-only device (FTO/(PEDOT:PSS)/HTL/Au). From the cross-sectional SEM analysis (Fig. S7, ESI†), the thickness of the 4-BA/Spiro is 294.3 nm (pure Spiro is 287.1 nm). The hole mobilities of Spiro and 4-BA/Spiro can be deduced to be 1.05 × 10−4 and 8.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (pure 4-BA is 6.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), which is an enhancement by 7 times. (shown in Fig. 3(d) and Fig. S8, ESI† shows the mobility of 4-BA). The results demonstrate a better hole extraction for the perovskite with 4-BA, mostly arising from fewer recombination sites at the interface. Therefore, the well-matched energy alignment accompanied by good charge transport properties ensure that 4-BA is an efficient tunnel layer for PSCs.

The effect of 4-BA treatment on the crystal quality of perovskite was analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. There is no obvious shift in the diffraction peaks between the films with/without 4-BA (Fig. 4(a)). It is demonstrated that the molecule size of 4-BA is too large to enter the perovskite lattice and affect the crystallization of the perovskite. The perovskite film with 4-BA also showed similar characteristic diffraction peaks at 14.0° and 28.3° (the (110) and (220) planes of the perovskite crystal) compared with the film without 4-BA (Fig. 4(b)).42

Meanwhile, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to characterize the effect of 4-BA on the surface morphology. It was revealed that the perovskite film with 4-BA became more homogeneous and smoother with a similar crystal size. Moreover, the surface roughness (RMS) of the perovskite film with 4-BA (33.9 nm) is slightly decreased compared with the bare perovskite film (45.2 nm), which is probably due to 4-BA deposition on the perovskite film (Fig. S9 and S10, ESI†). The energy dispersive X-ray detector test of the element O shows that the 4-BA molecule covers the perovskite surface (Fig. S11, ESI†). It tends to form a uniform interface between the perovskite and the HTL. Fig. 4(c) displays the UV-vis absorption spectra of the perovskite films with/without 4-BA. The absorption of the film with 4-BA slightly increases, implying an enhanced light-harvesting capacity.43 Furthermore, it can also be observed in Fig. 4(d) that the PbI2 peak of the perovskite film with 4-BA is significantly lower than the film without 4-BA. In particular, no obvious PbI2 particles appeared on the surface of the perovskite film with 4-BA, while redundant PbI2 particles can be seen in the film without 4-BA, producing quite a lumpy morphology. Nevertheless, the excess of PbI2 in this work is 5%, which can explain that PbI2 still exists in the film with 4-BA. In addition, a small amount of PbI2 on the perovskite film can passivate defects and promote improvement of the device performance.44
The ESP map of 4-BA shows the most electronegative area is mainly distributed on the N atoms of the bipyridine units, which can potentially act to passivate defects in the perovskite through forming coordination bonds with uncoordinated Pb2+. To further confirm the defect passivation effect of 4-BA for perovskite, an X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study was performed to monitor the change in characteristic peaks caused by the interactions between 4-BA and the perovskite film, and the results are shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). Compared with the perovskite film without 4-BA, the binding energies of Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 for the film with 4-BA have obvious shifts towards lower binding energies (from 138.29 eV and 143.13 eV to 137.83 eV and 142.70 eV) (Fig. 5(a)). Such a phenomenon suggests that the electron cloud density around Pb2+ is increased when 4-BA is covered on the perovskite and that there is a strong electrostatic interaction between Pb2+ and 4-BA. To further verify the interaction between the N atom in 4-BA and Pb2+, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT–IR) was used to observe the interaction between 4-BA and PbI2. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the peaks around 1601 cm−1 and 1244 cm−1 for bare 4-BA are attributed to the stretching vibrations of CN and C–N.23,45 After mixing with PbI2, the CN peak moved to 1597 cm−1 and the C–N peak moved to 1240 cm−1. The infrared peak of the carbon–nitrogen bond appeared to be red-shifted showing that the electron cloud density around the nitrogen atom in 4-BA is decreased after interaction with PbI2. The stretching vibration peak of Pb–I significantly shifted after 4-BA treatment, (Fig. S13, ESI†) implying strong coordination between Pb2+ and 4-BA. Therefore, the XPS and FT–IR measurements confirm the existence of Pb–N coordinated interactions between 4-BA and the perovskite film, thereby reducing charge recombination at the perovskite/HTL interface.

Suppressing the defect trap states located at the perovskite/HTL interface is beneficial for restricting charge recombination and improving hole extraction. The density of the defect trap states of the perovskite film were analyzed. The current–voltage (J–V) curves of the electron-only device with the structure FTO/TiO2/perovskite/PCBM/Au and the hole-only device with the structure FTO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/Au were measured (Fig. 5(c) and Fig. S14, ESI†). The defect trap densities for the electron-only and the hole-only devices with 4-BA are reduced compared to the device without 4-BA. By utilizing 4-BA, the trap filling limit voltage (VTFL) of the perovskite film of the electron-only device decreases from 0.79 to 0.28 V, and the defect trap density reduces from 8.32 × 1015 to 2.95 × 1015 cm−3. Correspondingly, for the hole-only device, the VTFL decreases from 0.42 V to 0.25 V and the defect density decreases from 4.42 × 1015 to 2.63 × 1015 cm−3 (the detailed calculation process is shown in the ESI†). The decrease in the trap density is consistent with the ESP and XPS results, indicating that the lone pair of electrons on the N atom of the bipyridine unit acts as a Lewis base to interact with the uncoordinated Pb2+ ion. This result is expected to restrict non-radiative recombination and to improve the Voc of the corresponding solar cells.
The n–i–p type PSCs were fabricated to evaluate the effect of 4-BA. The structure of the PSC using 4-BA as a functional layer and the SEM cross-sectional image are shown in Fig. 6(a) and Fig. S7 (ESI†). To better clarify the influence of 4-BA content on charge transfer, we investigated the surface potential difference of perovskite films deposited with different concentrations of 4-BA (Fig. S15, ESI†). It can be seen that the highest surface potential (838 mV) was obtained at a 4-BA concentration of 0.8 mg ml−1, which indicates efficient charge transfer. We also studied the effect of 4-AB content on the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Fig. S16, ESI†) and the performance of the PSCs (Fig. S17, ESI†), and the corresponding parameters are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). The optimal concentration of 4-BA is 0.8 mg ml−1. The J–V curves in Fig. 6(b) show that the device without 4-BA exhibits a PCE of 20.2% with a Jsc of 24.0 mA cm12, a Voc of 1.08 V, a filling factor (FF) of 77.5%, and a hysteresis index (HI) of 0.07 (Table 1, Fig. S18, ESI†). The PCE of the device with 4-BA is 22.4% and is coupled with a Jsc of 24.6 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.12 V, an FF of 81.7%, and a HI of 0.04. The enhanced Voc and FF of the device with 4-BA are attributed to well-matched energy alignment and efficient defect passivation.46,47 Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and dark current density characterization were further carried out to evaluate the series resistance and interfacial recombination under dark conditions. Fig. 6(c) shows the Nyquist plots of the devices with/without 4-BA. EIS data were fitted based on the equivalent circuit model shown in the inset of Fig. 6(c).48 A lower series resistance Rs of the device with 4-BA indicates that 4-BA as the functional layer is efficient in accelerating the carrier's extraction and transport. The recombination capacitance Rct of the device with 4-BA is 7.23 KΩ higher than the device without 4-BA (3.45 KΩ), suggesting a slower charge recombination at the 4-BA/perovskite interface. According to Fig. S19 (ESI†), the device with 4-BA has a shorter charge lifetime compared to the device without 4-BA (τ0 = 3.18 ms vs. τ0 = 7.98 ms). The shorter charge lifetime indicates faster hole collection.49Fig. 6(d) shows that the dark current of the device with 4-BA (2.0 × 10−8 mA cm−2) is reduced by 84.6% than that without 4-BA (1.3 × 10−7 mA cm−2). The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) curve plotted in Fig. 6(e) shows that the device with 4-BA exhibits slightly enhanced electron-current conversion efficiency in the spectral range from 350 to 800 nm. In addition, the integrated Jsc value of the device with 4-BA is 23.4 mA cm−2, which is higher than that device without 4-BA (22.2 mA cm−2). This result is consistent with the Jsc value from the J–V curve. The steady-state current density of the device with 4-BA was measured at a bias voltage of 0.94 V, and its output was 23.35 mA cm−2. The stabilized PCE was calculated to be 21.95%, which is in good agreement with the J–V measurement and the IPCE curve (Fig. 6(f)).

A photovoltaic parameter histogram of 20 PSC devices is provided in Fig. 7(a), showing good reproducibility of device fabrication. The mean PCE of the devices without 4-BA and with 4-BA are 19.7% and 21.7%, respectively. Simultaneously, the influence of 4-BA on perovskite stability was investigated. The devices were stored in the dark and ambient air with 60% RH conditions as shown in Fig. 7(b). The PCE of the device with 4-BA could retain almost 81% of its initial efficiency after 30 days of aging, while the device without 4-BA showed 53% of the initial efficiency. The improved stability is attributed to the hydrophobic surface with a water contact angle of 89.95° that is found for the perovskite film with 4-BA (Fig. 7(c)). In addition, 4-BA improved the stability of perovskite by suppressing PbI2 and reducing the density states, which could delay the degradation of the perovskite layer.

Conclusion
In summary, we have developed a D–A–D conjugated small molecule,4-BA, with a bipyridine core as an efficient hole transport tunnel and a passivation material between perovskite and hole transporting layer for high-performance PSCs. This molecule exhibits high thermal stability and a great ability for hole extraction and transport. The molecule coats the perovskite layer, constructing energy alignment and an efficient hole transport tunnel such that the hole mobility is increased by 7 times for the PSCs. At the same time, the bipyridine core passivates defects in the perovskite, which minimizes the defect density and increases the Voc. Consequently, the PCE of the PSCs is improved from 20.2% to 22.4%, with enhanced long-term stability by employing 4-BA under ambient conditions. Overall, our results indicate that the facile synthesis of 4-BA with a π-conjugated structure in this work not only provides a new material but also delivers a strategy to design suitable functional layers for PSCs.
