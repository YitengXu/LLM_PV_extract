        Yolk–shell TiO2 beads consisting of nanoparticles are synthesized by using a facile hydrothermal method. The influences of hydrothermal reaction temperature on the size of TiO2 particles and the photovoltaic performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been investigated in detail. A DSSC based on the yolk–shell TiO2 bead photoelectrode (∼15 μm) exhibits an energy conversion efficiency of 9.05%, which is much higher than that of P25 (7.56%). This can be mainly attributed to the fast electron transport and long electron lifetime resulting in a larger electron diffusion coefficient and higher charge collection efficiency for the former, which are confirmed by intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS), intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). In addition, the superior light scattering ability of hierarchical yolk–shell TiO2 beads compared to P25 film measured by UV-vis diffuse spectrum also contributes to higher photocurrent and photovoltaic performance.
1. Introduction
In the past two decades, the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), using nanocrystalline TiO2 as photoanode material, ruthenium complex or metal-free dye as light absorber, I−/I3− as electrolyte and Pt as counter electrode,1 has attracted more and more attention because of its low cost of material and fabrication, and it is regarded as one of the most promising alternatives to the currently commercial silicon based solar cells.2 The photoanode material has been found to play an important role in the photovoltaic performance of a DSSC since it influences the dye loading, light scattering and electron transport. Significant achievements have been made by using TiO2 photoelectrodes with various morphologies such as nanoparticles,3,4 sub-microspheres,5 beads,6,7 one-dimensional (1D) or quasi-1D nanoarrays (e.g.nanorods/wires,8–10 and nanotubes).11–13 To date, a maximum power conversion efficiency of more than 12% in lab has been obtained by using a ruthenium complex light-harvester, volatile organic solvent electrolyte and TiO2 photoelectrode.14 In a DSSC, light is absorbed by dye molecules attached to the surface of nanocrystalline TiO2 to generate free electrons injecting into the TiO2 conduction band, which are then transported to external loads to generate a photocurrent. Thereby, how to improve the photocurrent constitutes a central issue as to enhancing the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.
It is well known that the overall energy conversion efficiency (η) of a solar cell is given by the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), the fill factor (FF) and the intensity of the incident light (Pin): η = JscVocFF/Pin.15 And the Jsc can be calculated by the following expression: Jsc = qηlhηinjηccI0,16 where q is the elementary charge, ηlh is the light harvesting efficiency of a cell commonly determined by the amount of adsorbed dye and light-scattering of films, ηinj is the electron injection efficiency, ηcc is the charge collection efficiency largely determined by the competition between the electron transport and recombination, and I0 is the light flux. Up to now, various techniques including deposition of a compact layer on the conductive substrate (FTO glass or Ti foil) and/or TiO2 photoelectrode surface to reduce the recombination and enhance the charge collection efficiency,17–21 co-sensitization by applying different dyes to make full use of the solar light,22 and post-treatment with a TiCl4 precursor,10,23,24 have been proposed to improve the performance of DSSCs. However, improvement of light harvesting efficiency is still one of the challenging pathways for researchers to enhance the photocurrent and the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs. Recently, a variety of semiconducting materials with different morphologies have been reported to improve light harvesting efficiency to further enhance the conversion efficiency of the DSSC.7,25–28 Usually, there are two basic ideas to enhance light harvesting efficiency: (i) increase the dye loading on TiO2; (ii) enhance the scattering of the incident light within the cell. The well known way to increase the dye loading is to use a nanoparticle film with a suitable size (10–30 nm) which has a large surface area to adsorb dye molecules. However, such kinds of thin films are usually transparent or semi-transparent resulting in the loss of a significant portion of the visible light through the transmission. For enhancing the scattering of the incident light, the most common strategy is to apply a layer of light scattering material with larger particle size (>300 nm) on the top of the nanoparticle photoelectrode film to utilize the light efficiently for electron generation and hence enhance the photocurrent.29 Recently, hierarchical spherical or octahedral photoanode materials consisting of nanoparticles have been variedly synthesized that show superior photovoltaic performance in DSSCs.7,27,28,30,31 Herein, we report a hydrothermal fabrication of hierarchical nanoporous yolk–shell TiO2 beads consisting of nanoparticles and their application as a bifunctional photoanode material in DSSCs. The photovoltaic performance (9.05%) of a DSSC based on the hierarchical TiO2 bead photoelectrode is ∼20% higher than that of the P25 cell (7.56%), which is investigated in detail by IPCE, diffuse spectrum, IMPS, IMVS and EIS characterizations.
2. Experimental section
Preparation of hierarchical yolk–shell TiO2 beads
The hierarchical yolk–shell TiO2 beads were prepared by a hydrothermal treatment of a solution containing NH4F (1.14 g), urea (42.79 g), TiCl4 (2.78 mL), H2O (24 mL) and ethanol (21.6 mL). The hydrothermal reactions were performed at varied temperatures of 100 °C, 120 °C, 140 °C, 160 °C and 180 °C for 12 h, respectively. The as-prepared powder samples were washed extensively with deionized water and ethanol and finally dried in air at 100 °C for 5 h. Afterward, the as-prepared samples were annealed in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 3 h with a ramping rate of 2 °C min−1.
Preparation of TiO2 working electrode
In order to enhance the photovoltaic performance, a TiO2 compact layer (200 nm in thickness) with very small sized nanoparticles on the FTO glass was firstly prepared. The transparent anatase TiO2 (3–5 nm in particle size) colloidal solution was prepared by heating the precursors (60 °C for 12 h) containing titanium n-butoxide (Ti(OBu)4, 34.2 mL), acetylacetone (10.2 mL), n-butanol (37.6 mL), para-toluene-sulfonic acid (3.8 g) and H2O (18.0 mL),32 and was then spin-coated on the cleaned FTO glass (15 Ω per square, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan) to form a compact layer on the FTO glass with a thickness of about 200 nm. Secondly, the P25 or yolk–shell TiO2 bead paste was screen-printed on the compact layer-coated FTO glass. The paste fabrication process has been reported in our previous paper.33 Briefly, TiO2 powder (P25 particles or hierarchical yolk–shell TiO2 beads) (1.0 g) was ground for 40 min in a mixture of ethanol (8.0 mL), acetic acid (0.2 mL), terpineol (3.0 g) and ethyl cellulose (0.5 g) to form a slurry, and then the slurry was sonicated for 5 min in an ultrasonic bath to form a viscous TiO2 paste. The different thickness of TiO2 films can be easily controlled through repeated screen-printing. After a sintering process (at 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and then 500 °C for 15 min) to remove the organic substances, the TiO2 films were soaked in 0.04 M TiCl4 aqueous solution for 30 min at 70 °C to improve the photocurrent and photovoltaic performance. After sintering at 520 °C for 30 min, the TiO2 photoelectrode films were immersed into 0.5 mM N719 dye (Solaronix Co.) in acetonitrile/tert-butanol (volume ratio 1:1), and sensitized for about 16 h at room temperature. Afterward, these films were rinsed with acetonitrile in order to remove physisorbed N719 dye molecules.

Dye sensitized solar cell assembly
To evaluate their photovoltaic performance, the dye-sensitized TiO2/FTO films were sandwiched together with Pt coated FTO glass which was used as a counter electrode. Platinized counter electrodes were fabricated by thermal deposition of H2PtCl6 solution (5 mM in isopropanol) onto FTO glass at 400 °C for 15 min. The electrolyte (0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15)) was injected into the space (∼25 μm) between the sandwiched cells.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffractometry (XRD, Bruker D8 Advance), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JSM-6330F), transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2010 HR), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) are used to examine the phase purity, crystalline structure and morphologies of the samples. The current–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under one sun AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination with a solar light simulator (Oriel, Model: 91192). A 1000 W Xenon arc lamp (Oriel, Model: 6271) served as a light source and its incident light intensity was calibrated with a NREL-calibrated Si solar cell equipped with an optical filter to approximate AM 1.5 G one sun (100 mW cm−2) light intensity before each measurement. The IPCE spectra were measured as a function of wavelength from 350 to 800 nm on the basis of a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator. The electrochemical impedance spectra were measured using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) with a frequency response analyzer at a bias potential of −800 mV in the dark with a frequency ranging from 10 mHz to 1 MHz. The magnitude of the alternating signal was 10 mV. The impedance parameters were determined by fitting of the impedance spectra using Z-view software. Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) measurements were carried out on the electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) with a frequency response analyzer under modulated green light emitting diodes (457 nm) driven by a source supply (Zahner, PP211), which can provide both dc and ac components of the illumination. The modulated light intensity was 10% or less than the base light intensity. The frequency range was set from 1 kHz to 0.1 Hz. In order to measure the amount of dye adsorbed on the TiO2 film, the dye was desorbed into 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution, and the absorption spectra of the desorbed-dye solution and reflectance of the film were measured using a UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer (UV-3150). The TiO2 film thickness was measured by using a profilometer (Ambios, XP-1).
3. Results and discussion
The XRD patterns of the sample prepared by the urea-assisted hydrothermal reaction at 160 °C are shown in Fig. 1 (curve I); the well defined and broader Bragg peaks with low intensity indicate the poor TiO2 crystal nature of the compound. After calcination at 500 °C for 3 h of the as-prepared sample, all diffraction peaks (curve II) are in good agreement with the anatase phase TiO2 (JCPDS no. 65-2900, a = 3.785, b = 3.785, c = 9.514). The mean crystallite size calculated along the (101) plane using the Scherrer formula is about 18 nm for the TiO2 nanoparticle calcined at 500 °C for 3 h.

The morphology and internal structure of the annealed TiO2 sample (Sample-160) are further characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The SEM image (Fig. 2a) shows that the TiO2 beads with a size range of 400–600 nm are densely packed with single nanoparticles having multiple contacts with neighboring nanoparticles. Though the interstitial space between yolk and shell is very small, the yolk–shell structure can be distinguished (Fig. S1a†, arrow). Furthermore, Fig. S1b and c† (see arrows) show that some of the yolks are separated from the shells. Hence, these SEM images can clearly confirm that the present samples are yolk–shell TiO2 beads. The TEM image (Fig. 2b) further shows that the TiO2 beads have a yolk–shell structure consisting of nanosized crystallites providing a porous nature, which is further proved by Fig. 2c. A higher resolution TEM image (Fig. 2c) shows that the TiO2 nanocrystals inside the yolk–shell TiO2 beads have an average size of 18.5 nm. The HRTEM image, shown in Fig. 2d, allows the resolution of lattice fringes of the crystals to be correlated with the (101) plane of the anatase TiO2. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset in Fig. 2d) also confirms the anatase phase of the annealed sample.

The formation of the novel yolk–shell TiO2 beads in the presence of urea is further discussed. During the hydrothermal process, a complex [Ti(OH)nClm]2− (n + m = 6) would be firstly formed due to the hydrolysis of TiCl4, which could produce TiO2 embryos and then act as seeds for the further growth of TiO2.34 The NH4F present in solution could behave as an electrolyte and thus modify the zeta potential of spherical poly-condensed titania species generated at the initial stage of the hydrolysis reaction.34 The hydrolysis and ethanolysis of TiCl4 occur within the surrounding of CO(NH2)2, then the formed TiO2 particles would serve as the nucleation sites for CO(NH2)2 deposition. The CO(NH2)2 surface is hydrophilic because of the presence of –NH2 and –CO groups. So, under the condition of high water and ethanol content, the TiO2 particles are well solubilized with little aggregation. After an annealing process in air, the CO(NH2)2 in the beads decompose to CO2, H2O and N2, and then diffuse toward the outside, resulting in the compression of the TiO2 particles at the surface region inside the shell. This annealing progression will lead to the formation of a hollow yolk–shell structure consisting entirely of aggregates of TiO2 particles.34,35 On the basis of the results above, a possible formation process of the yolk–shell TiO2 beads consisting of TiO2 particles is proposed in Scheme 1, which illustrates the role of CO(NH2)2 as a structure-directing agent affecting the morphology in the hydrothermal process.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the formation of hierarchical yolk–shell TiO2 beads. 
To shed light on the formation mechanism of hierarchical TiO2 yolk–shell beads, the growth process was monitored by examining the products prepared at different reaction times (3 h, 6 h and 12 h). It is clear that the average diameter of the TiO2 beads increases from ∼250 nm, ∼350 nm to ∼500 nm as the reaction time is varied from 3 h (Fig. S2a–c†), 6 h (Fig. S2d–f†), to 12 h (Fig. 2b and S1†), respectively. However, there are no yolk–shell structures when the reaction is performed at a shorter time (3 h or 6 h). In the present reaction system, the CO(NH2)2 most likely participates in hydrogen-bonding interactions with –NH2 to form inorganic–organic composites. The hydrolysis of TiCl4 is very fast at the initial reaction stage, hence the nanoparticles tend to self-organize into condensed beads to reduce the interfacial free energy and surface energy. However, the hydrolysis rate will be slowed down because of the consumption of the titanium source (TiCl4) over longer time (12 h). In this stage, CO(NH2)2 will play a more important role as a structure-direction agent to affect the morphology which is responsible for the formation of hierarchical yolk–shell TiO2 beads during the hydrothermal synthesis (Scheme 1).
The FTIR spectra of as-prepared and annealed hierarchical beads are shown in Fig. S3†. For the as-prepared sample, signals at 3209 cm−1, 1631 cm−1 and 1401 cm−1 are assigned to the N–H, CO and C–N bond stretching modes in CO(NH2)2, respectively, showing the presence of CO(NH2)2 molecules. However, after calcination, the signals disappear (or weaken) because of the decomposition of CO(NH2)2 during the heating treatment. Fig. S4† shows a TG curve of the as-prepared samples in flowing air at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. As shown in Fig. S3†, the TG curve can be divided into three stages. The first stage ranges from room temperature to 200 °C with a mass loss of 6.12%, which is caused by the elimination of water from the as-prepared samples. The second stage, from 200 to 500 °C, can be assigned to the elimination of carbonaceous residues, over which a mass loss of 4.55% was observed. The last stage is from 500 to 900 °C, where the mass loss is only about 1.13% indicating the loss of surface hydroxyl groups.36
Effects of hydrothermal temperature on the morphology are further investigated. Fig. S5a–d† show the typical SEM images of samples prepared at varied reaction temperatures of 100 °C (Sample-100), 120 °C (Sample-120), 140 °C (Sample-140) and 180 °C (Sample-180), respectively, revealing a similar morphology with a primary particle size of about 14–20 nm and a secondary sphere size of 400–600 nm. The XRD patterns shown in Fig. S6† reveal that all of the samples prepared at different reaction temperatures are anatase TiO2 after an annealing process of 500 °C for 3 h. The crystallite sizes calculated along the (101) plane using the Scherer formula were increased from about 14 nm, 16 nm, 17 nm to 20 nm for Sample-100, Sample-120, Sample-140 and Sample-180, respectively.
The hierarchical yolk–shell TiO2 beads are further used as photoanodes for DSSC applications. First, a compact TiO2 layer was deposited on FTO glass by the spin-coating method.27Yolk–shell TiO2 bead samples prepared at different temperatures were screen-printed on compact layer-coated FTO glasses with similar thickness (∼13 μm), respectively. The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves and detailed parameters of short-circuit current densities (Jsc), open-circuit voltages (Voc), fill factors (FFs) and the overall energy conversion efficiencies (η) for the five cells are shown in Fig. 3 and summarized in Table 1, respectively. Clearly, these cells possess similar Voc and FF of around 819 ± 5 mV and 0.64 ± 0.01, respectively. However, the Jsc varied from 14.53 mA cm−2 for Sample-100 to 16.57 mA cm−2 for Sample-160, and then decreased to 15.84 mA cm−2 for Sample-180. As a result, the η increased systematically from 7.49% for Sample-100 to 8.71% for Sample-160 and then decreased to 8.25% for Sample-180 due to the different Jsc.

The photocurrent density, as well known, is strongly related to the amount of dye loading on the TiO2 films. The amounts of dye adsorbed on the films were obtained by measuring the UV-vis absorption spectra of solutions containing dyes detached from the films in H2O (3 mL) with 0.1 M NaOH. It is found that the dye amount on the film of Sample-160 is higher than those of other films shown in Table 1, which leads to more photogenerated electrons and higher photocurrents for the former. The varying Jsc and η with a similar response to different dye adsorptions may be caused by the different particle size and surface energy endowed by different hydrothermal reaction temperatures (100–160 °C).37 A higher hydrothermal reaction temperature will result in a larger amount of dye adsorption owing to higher surface energy.4,10 However, the Jsc and η of Sample-180 decrease to a lower level compared to Sample-160, which can be possibly ascribed to the larger primary TiO2 particle size (20 nm) that brings about a reduction of surface area and dye loading.
In order to study the influence of film thickness on the photovoltaic performance, photoelectrodes prepared via screen printing with a thickness of 7–19 μm (Sample-160) were used for DSSCs. The J–V curves of cells based on different film thickness are shown in Fig. 4a and detailed photovoltaic parameters of those DSSCs are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 4a and Table 2, the short-circuit photocurrent density varies from 14.00 mA cm−2 to 18.01 mA cm−2, as the film thickness increases from 7 to 15 μm, which can be attributed to the increase in the adsorbed dye molecules (Table 2, dye loading varied from 50.4 to 103.9 nmol cm−2) to inject more electrons. Moreover, thicker films with stronger light-scattering effects would also improve the light-harvesting efficiency resulting in a higher Jsc for Sample-160-based DSSCs, which was confirmed by UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of various films, as shown in Fig. 4b. In spite of the higher dye amounts and superior light scattering ability of the 19 μm film compared to the 15 μm film, the Jsc shows a slight decrease from 18.01 to 17.78 mA cm−2, which can be attributed to the larger amount of defects and recombination for a thicker film. Moreover, for thicker film (19 μm), the outer TiO2 particle layers do not contribute significantly to the photogeneration of conduction band electrons due to the filtering of light by the dyed particles located close to the FTO glass. The open-circuit voltage decreases gradually with the increasing film thickness due to the augmentation of the surface area, which provides additional charge-recombination sites and enhances the dark current.38 As a result, the power conversion efficiencies of the solar cells are 7.54, 8.09, 8.71, 9.05 and 8.74% with a film thickness of 7, 10, 13, 15 and 19 μm, respectively. Hence, the DSSC with an optimum film thickness of 15 ± 0.1 μm achieved the highest power conversion efficiency (9.05%) with a Jsc of 18.01 mA cm−2, Voc of 803 mV and FF of 0.63 under simulated AM 1.5 G one sun (100 mW cm−2) illumination.

To demonstrate the advantage of the bifunctional hierarchical yolk–shell TiO2 beads, commercially available TiO2 nanoparticles (Degussa P25) photoelectrode was also prepared using the same procedure with a similar film thickness (15 μm) for comparison (Fig. 5a and b). Fig. 5c shows the J–V curves of Sample-160 and P25 based solar cells, and the resultant photovoltaic parameters are depicted in Table 2. It can be seen that both Jsc (18.01 mA cm−2) and Voc (803 mV) of the Sample-160 based cell are obviously higher than those (14.66 mA cm−2 and 783 mV) of P25, which results in the power conversion efficiency of the former (9.05%) being ∼20% higher than the latter (7.56%). Although the dye amounts on hierarchical yolk–shell TiO2 beads (103.9 nmol cm−2) are less than those on the P25 nanoparticles (117.2 nmol cm−2), the Jsc of the former is much higher than the latter, which can be probably attributed to the superior light scattering ability of the hierarchical yolk–shell TiO2 beads. As shown in Fig. S7†, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the Sample-160 and P25 films clearly show that the hierarchical yolk–shell TiO2 beads have much higher diffuse reflectance in the entire UV-vis range (400–800 nm). Hence, such a photoanode material would maximize the use of solar light, which can improve the light harvesting efficiency and Jsc. Fig. 5d displays the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra as a function of wavelength for P25 and Sample-160 based DSSCs. Obviously, the IPCE value of the Sample-160 based cell is higher than that of the P25 based cell over the whole wavelength range, which is consistent with the higher Jsc for the former as displayed in Fig. 5c. The much higher IPCE in the long-wavelength region (550–750 nm) for the hierarchical yolk–shell TiO2 beads is probably the result of the better light-scattering ability (Fig. S6†) caused by the larger size (400–600 nm) of beads.

Fig. 6a shows the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the two DSSCs based on hierarchical yolk–shell TiO2 beads and P25 nanoparticles.39–41 Two semicircles, including a small one at higher frequency and a large one at lower frequency, are observed in the Nyquist plots (Fig. 6a). As we have known, the small semicircle in the frequency range of 1 kHz to 1 MHz fitted to a charge-transfer resistance and the capacitance should be ascribed to the process at the redox electrolyte/Pt counter electrode interface. The larger semicircle in the lower frequency range (0.1–1 kHz) is ascribed to the recombination resistance and chemical capacitance across the TiO2/redox electrolyte interface. The recombination resistance of the Sample-160 based cell (117.2 Ω) is larger than that of the P25 based cell (47.5 Ω) obtained from the Z-view software and the inset model, implying a slower electron recombination process for the former. The Bode phase plots of EIS spectra (Fig. 6b) display the frequency peaks of the charge transfer process at different interfaces for these two TiO2 based cells. The electron lifetime values derived from curve fitting are 24.1 and 146.2 ms for P25-based and Sample-160 based DSSCs, respectively. The longer electron lifetime observed for Sample-160 indicates more effective suppression of the back reaction of the injected electron with the I3− in the electrolyte and is reflected in the improvements seen in the photocurrent and photovoltage, yielding substantially enhanced power conversion efficiency.42

spectra of Nyquist plots (a) and Bode plots (b); incident light intensity dependent transport time constant, lifetime constant (c) and electron diffusion coefficient (d) for DSSCs based on P25 and Sample-160 photoelectrodes. EIS measurements were performed in the dark at −0.8 V bias. 
To gauge the dynamics of electron transport and charge recombination of those two DSSCs, intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS)43 are further performed under illumination with a LED light source (λ = 457 nm) with different light intensities from 30 to 150 W m−2 as shown in Fig. 6c. The IMVS shows that the lifetime or recombination time (τr) of the Sample-160 based cell is larger than that of the P25-based cell, in agreement with the results of EIS measurement, which is indicative of the higher photovoltage of the former. Furthermore, the transport time (τd) of the Sample-160 based cell is less than that of the P25 based cell, showing a faster electron transport for the former cell (Fig. 6c). The electron diffusion coefficient (Dn) in TiO2 films can be obtained by fitting the frequency-dependent response using the analytical expression (Dn = d2/(4 × τd), where d is film thickness) from the IMPS measurement. Fig. 6d represents the results in the form of the electron diffusion coefficient as a function of light intensity. The Dn of the DSSC based on Sample-160 is almost three times larger than that of P25. This significant improvement of electron transport can be related to the close packing of grains arising from the crystal intergrowth within the beads, which results in the excellent interior contacts between the constituent nanoparticles. To weigh the electron transport and recombination properties in combination, charge-collection efficiency (ηcc = 1 − (τd/τr)) and electron diffusion length (Ln = (Dnτr)1/2), which are apparently considered more reliable parameters, were further estimated by IMPS and IMVS measurements. Derived from the data of Fig. 6c, the ηcc results under different light intensities of two kinds of DSSCs are displayed in Fig. S8†. The ηcc of the P25 based cell is 94.5 ± 0.05% when the light intensity is increased from 30 to 150 mW cm−2. However, the ηcc of the Sample-160 based cell remains constantly at about 99% under various light intensities, which can result in a higher Jsc for the Sample-160 based cell compared to P25 according to the expression Jsc = qηlhηinjηccI0. The calculated electron diffusion lengths derived from the IMPS/IMVS measurement for those two photoanodes are depicted in Fig. S9† as a function of light intensity. The electron effective diffusion length for Sample-160 materials (around 70 μm) is obviously superior to P25 nanoparticles (around 30 μm) under illumination at 30 to 150 W m−2.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate the hydrothermal fabrication of novel hierarchical anatase yolk–shell TiO2 beads. The detailed research shows that the optimal hydrothermal reaction temperature (160 °C) and film thickness (15 μm) lead to the highest power conversion efficiency (9.05%) along with a Jsc of 18.01 mA cm−2, Voc of 803 mV and FF of 0.63. The photovoltaic performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) based on the hierarchical anatase yolk–shell TiO2 beads (9.05%) is about 20% higher than that of commercial P25 nanoparticles (7.56%). Confirmed by IMPS, IMVS, EIS, IPCE and UV-vis diffuse reflectance characterizations, the significant improvement of the photovoltaic performance (larger photocurrent and photovoltage) for hierarchical TiO2 yolk–shell beads compared to P25 can be attributed to the superior light scattering ability, faster electron transport and slower electron recombination rate. The electron diffusion coefficient (Dn) and effective diffusion length (Ln) of DSSCs based on hierarchical yolk–shell TiO2 beads are three times and two times larger than those of P25 nanoparticle-based cells, respectively.
