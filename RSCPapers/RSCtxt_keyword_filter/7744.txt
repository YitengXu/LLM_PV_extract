    , Accepted 6th November 2017First published on 8th November 2017AbstractTwo new furo[3,2-c]pyridine-based Ir complexes, namely (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) and (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac), were designed and synthesized by introducing a methoxyl group into the 4- and 3-positions of the phenyl ring on the C^N ligand. It was found that the position of the methoxyl group has an important influence on the electrochemical and photophysical properties, as well as electrophosphorescent device performance. Compared with the reference complex (pfupy)2Ir(acac) without any methoxyl group (538 nm), (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) with a methoxyl group at the 4-position shows a blue-shifted emission peak at 523 nm originating from the methoxyl-induced enhancement of the LUMO level, whereas (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) with a methoxyl group at the 3-position shows a red-shifted emission peak at 602 nm originating from the methoxyl-induced enhancement of the HOMO level. The corresponding PhOLEDs based on (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) and (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) realize highly efficient green and orange electroluminescence with CIE coordinates of (0.37, 0.60) and (0.60, 0.40), revealing a state-of-the-art EQE as high as 29.5% (100.7 cd A−1) and 16.7% (43.9 cd A−1), respectively. These impressive results indicate that methoxyl modification is a valid way to tune the molecular energy levels and emissive color for Ir complexes while not obviously sacrificing the final device performance.
Introduction
The alkoxyl group is one of the basic substituents in organic chemistry owing to its facile synthesis through the Williamson route.1–4 Unlike other groups (e.g. alkyl, amine, halogen, cyano and nitro), it displays two opposite electronic effects: (1) a resonance electron-donating effect due to the lone pair of electrons of oxygen and (2) an inductive electron-withdrawing effect due to the stronger electronegativity of oxygen than carbon.5,6 Since the resonance electron-donating effect is dominant over the inductive electron-withdrawing effect, the alkoxyl group is often seen as an electron-donating group.7 Therefore, it could be purposefully used to modulate the molecular energy level at the same time when introduced to the conjugated main chain to increase the solubility of conjugated polymers.8,9 For instance, in quinoxaline-based polymers, PTTQx, the meta-alkoxyl-phenyl moiety, was found to reduce the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level with respect to the para-alkoxyl-phenyl moiety.10 Furthermore, replacing the alkylthienyl with a meta-alkoxyl-phenyl moiety in benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b]dithiophene (BDT)-based two-dimensional conjugated polymers led to significant enhancement of the open-circuit voltage from 0.60 V to 0.78 V and consequently improved the power conversion efficiency from 5.56% to 7.50% for the corresponding polymer solar cells (PSCs).11 The emission color regulation of iridium (Ir) complexes, which is related to their energy levels, has also been a research hotpot in phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes (PhOLEDs).12–29 Although the alkoxyl group was incorporated into Ir complexes, few systematic investigations have been reported on the effect of the alkoxyl group on their photophysical properties and final device performance.30–33
In previous work, we designed and synthesized a novel furo[3,2-c]pyridine-based Ir complex (pfupy)2Ir(acac)34 by replacing sulfur with oxygen in the C^N ligand. Compared with the typical thiophene-containing yellow phosphor (pthpy)2Ir(acac), a hypsochromic shift was observed for the furan-containing (pfupy)2Ir(acac), which exhibits a yellowish-green emission with Commission International De L’Eclairge (CIE) coordinates of (0.44, 0.55) and an unexpected external quantum efficiency (EQE) over 30% without any out-coupling technology. Considering the deviated emission of (pfupy)2Ir(acac) from the green region, there will be plenty of room for improvement in color purity while not sacrificing device efficiency.
With this idea in mind, we further demonstrate the methoxyl modification in (pfupy)2Ir(acac) towards highly efficient green- and orange-emitting PhOLEDs. When the methoxyl group locates at the 4-position of phenyl in the C^N ligand, the resultant complex (denoted as (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac)) achieves a more greenish emission than (pfupy)2Ir(acac), revealing CIE coordinates of (0.37, 0.60) and a peak EQE of 29.5% (100.7 cd A−1). Meanwhile, the 3-position substitution of the methoxyl group on the phenyl ring can endow the resultant complex (denoted as (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac)) with a red-shifted orange emission accompanied by CIE coordinates of (0.60, 0.40) and a peak EQE of 16.7% (43.9 cd A−1). The impressive results manifest that methoxyl modification is a valid way not only to tune the emissive wavelength of Ir complexes but also to keep the high device efficiency.
Experimental
Measurements and characterization

1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance NMR spectrometer. The elemental analysis was performed using a Bio-Rad elemental analysis system. MALDI/TOF (Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight) mass spectra were performed on an AXIMA CFR MS apparatus (COMPACT) with 2-[(2E)-3-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methylprop-2-enylidene]malononitrile (DCTB) as the matrix. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed under a flow of nitrogen using a Perkin-Elmer-TGA 7 and Perkin-Elmer-DSC 7 system, respectively. The UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 UV/Vis spectrometer and a Perkin-Elmer LS 50B spectrofluorometer, respectively. The PL quantum yields (PLQYs) were measured in N2-saturated toluene solutions with a typical green phosphor Ir(ppy)3 (ΦPL = 0.97) as in ref. 35. The transient PL spectra in toluene solutions were measured under N2 atmosphere and excited by a 355 nm pulse with ca. 3 ns width from a Quanty-Ray DCR-2 pulsed Nd:YAG laser. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were performed using a CHI660a electrochemical analyzer under a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The measurements were carried out in dichloromethane (DCM) for anodic sweeping and in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) for cathodic sweeping with a conventional three-electrode system consisting of a platinum working electrode, a platinum counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (n-Bu4NClO4). All potentials were calibrated against the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple (Fc/Fc+). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were determined by the equations HOMO = −e(Eox,onset + 4.8 V) and LUMO = −e(Ered,onset + 4.8 V), where Eox,onset and Ered,onset were the potential onset obtained from the first oxidation and reduction waves, respectively. The theoretical calculations were performed using the Gauss 09 program and the ground state structures of the Ir complexes were optimized by the DFT using the B3LYP hybrid functional. The “double-ξ” basis set LANL2DZ was employed for the Ir atom and 6-31G(d) basis sets for H, C, N, and O atoms.
Synthesis
All chemicals and reagents were used as received from commercial sources without further purification. Solvents for chemical synthesis were purified according to the standard procedures.
General procedure for the synthesis of C^N ligands
To a mixture of 4-chlorofuro[3,2-c]pyridine (1 equiv.), methoxylphenyl boronic acid (1.5 equiv.) and Pd(PPh3)4 (0.03 equiv.), the refined tetrahydrofuran (THF) and degassed 2 M Na2CO3 a.q (3 equiv.) were added under an argon atmosphere. After heating to reflux for 8 h, the organic layer was extracted by DCM and dried by Na2SO4. The crude product was purified by chromatography on silica gel using petroleum ether and ethyl acetate as the eluents.

Device fabrication and testing
All the devices were fabricated on glass substrates pre-coated with 180 nm indium tin oxide (ITO) with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω sq.−1 The ITO substrates were degreased in an ultrasonic solvent bath and then dried at 120 °C for 30 min. Before loading into the vacuum deposition chamber, the ITO surface was treated with UV-ozone for 15 min. In succession, 10 nm of MoO3 was deposited on the top of the ITO, followed by 60 nm TAPC (4,4′-(cyclohexane-1,1-diyl)bis(N,N-di-p-tolylaniline)), 5 nm TCTA (tris(4-(9H-carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)amine), a 20 nm emissive layer, and 35 nm BmPyPB (3,3′′,5,5′′-tetra(pyridin-3-yl)-1,1′:3′,1′′-terphenyl). Finally, 1 nm thickness of LiF and 120 nm thickness of Al were deposited to form the cathode. All the layers were grown by thermal evaporation in a high-vacuum system with a pressure of less than 5 × 10−4 Pa without breaking the vacuum. The organic materials were evaporated at a rate of 1–2 Å s−1 while the evaporation rate of the LiF layer was 0.1 Å s−1, and the metal Al was evaporated at a rate of 8–10 Å s−1. The overlap between the ITO and Al electrodes was 4 mm × 4 mm, which is the active emissive area of PhOLEDs. The current–voltage-brightness characteristics were measured using a set of Keithley source measurement units (Keithley 2400 and Keithley 2000) with a calibrated silicon photodiode. The electroluminescence (EL) spectra were measured using a Spectrascan PR650 spectrophotometer. All the measurements were carried out in ambient atmosphere at room temperature.
X-ray crystallography analysis
The single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out using a Bruker Smart APEX diffractometer with a CCD detector and graphite monochromator under Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The intensity data were recorded using the ω scan mode (187 K). Lorentz polarization factors were made for the intensity data and absorption corrections were performed using the SADABS program. The crystal structure was determined using the SHELXTL program and refined using full matrix least squares. All non-hydrogen atoms were assigned anisotropic displacement parameters, whereas hydrogen atoms were placed at calculated positions theoretically and included in the final cycles of refinement in a riding model along with the attached carbons.
Results and discussion
Molecular design, synthesis and characterization
Starting from (pfupy)2Ir(acac), a methoxyl group was introduced into the 4- and 3-positions of the phenyl ring to design the corresponding Ir complexes (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) and (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac), respectively. As depicted in Fig. 1, the LUMO is mainly localized on furo[3,2-c]pyridine and phenyl, while the HOMO is concentrated on the Ir centre and the phenyl ring in (pfupy)2Ir(acac). Varying the methoxyl positions on (pfupy)2Ir(acac) can lead to different LUMO and HOMO distributions. For example, in (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac), where the methoxyl group is meta to the Ir centre but para to the furo[3,2-c]pyridine moiety, its contribution to furo[3,2-c]pyridine by the resonance electron-donating effect is stronger than that to the Ir centre. Accordingly, the LUMO distribution of (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) is extended to the methoxyl group without obviously affecting the HOMO distribution. Benefiting from the elevated LUMO and similar HOMO energy levels, a wide bandgap could be anticipated for (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) relative to (pfupy)2Ir(acac). In contrast, in (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac), the methoxyl group contributes to the HOMO distribution rather than the LUMO distribution because of the para arrangement between the methoxyl group and the Ir centre. From (pfupy)2Ir(acac) to (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac), therefore, the HOMO energy level is increased and the LUMO remains nearly unchanged, resulting in a shallow bandgap. The DFT calculations clearly indicate the effectiveness of the methoxyl group in modulating the molecular energy levels of furo[3,2-c]pyridine-based Ir complexes.

The synthetic procedure for (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) and (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) is shown in Scheme 1. The furo[3,2-c]pyridine-based C^N ligands were first prepared by a Suzuki coupling reaction between 4-chlorofuro[3,2-c]pyridine and corresponding methoxyl-functionalized boric acids. Then, a traditional two-step route was performed to afford the terminal Ir complexes as reported by M. E. Thompson.36 Their molecular structures were fully characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and elemental analysis (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†). In addition, the single crystal of (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) for X-ray diffraction analysis was successfully grown from the mixed solution of DCM and methanol, but the attempt to grow the single crystal of (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) failed. As one can see in Fig. 2, (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) assumes a similar distorted quasi-octahedral geometric structure to (pfupy)2Ir(acac).34 Nevertheless, different from (pfupy)2Ir(acac), which shows a π–π interaction between furo[3,2-c]pyridine and the phenyl ring, an interaction between two furo[3,2-c]pyridine moieties with a π–π stacking distance of 3.267–3.287 Å is actually observed for (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) (Fig. S3, ESI†). This difference may be tentatively attributed to the steric hindrance from the methoxyl group substituted on the phenyl ring.

Electrochemical properties
CV was used to study the electrochemical properties of (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) and (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) relative to (pfupy)2Ir(acac). For all the Ir complexes, reversible oxidation and irreversible reduction were detected during the anodic scan in DCM and the cathodic scan in DMF, respectively (Fig. 3). With respect to Fc/Fc+ (4.8 eV under vacuum), their corresponding HOMO and LUMO levels were determined, and the data are tabulated in Table 1. Compared with (pfupy)2Ir(acac) (HOMO: −5.15 eV; LUMO: −2.40 eV), (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) displays an invariable HOMO of −5.15 eV and an elevated LUMO of −2.29 eV, whereas (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) exhibits an enhanced HOMO of −4.94 eV and a close LUMO of −2.45 eV. The experimental trend is well in line with the DFT calculations at the beginning of the molecular design.

Photophysical properties

Fig. 4 portrays the UV-Vis absorption and PL spectra in diluted solutions. Similar to (pfupy)2Ir(acac), both (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) and (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) possess two absorption bands including the intense ligand-centered (LC) π–π* absorption below 400 nm and the weak metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) absorption in the range 400–575 nm (Fig. 4a).13 Moreover, the lowest-energy-level absorption shows an obvious bathochromic shift following a sequence of (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac), (pfupy)2Ir(acac) and (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac). Correspondingly, the emission maxima move from 523 nm to 538 nm and 602 nm (Fig. 4b). The methoxyl dependence of the optical properties is consistent with the electrochemical properties as well as the DFT simulations. As discussed above, the blue-shifted absorption and PL of (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) could be ascribed to the wider bandgap than (pfupy)2Ir(acac), originating from the 4-position methoxyl contribution mainly to the increased LUMO level. For (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac), the rise of the HOMO level caused by the 3-position methoxyl is responsible for the shallower bandgap, and thus red-shifted absorption and PL with regard to (pfupy)2Ir(acac).

Compared with (pfupy)2Ir(acac) (1.04 μs), close decay lifetimes of 1.07 μs and 1.33 μs are determined for (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) and (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac), respectively (Fig. S4, ESI†). Despite this, the PLQY of (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) (0.88) seems to be a bit higher than that of (pfupy)2Ir(acac) (0.80) because of the slightly faster radiative rate constant (kr) and slower non-radiative rate constant (knr). In contrast, (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) shows a significantly descent PLQY of 0.32 with a tardy kr and rapid knr owing to the energy gap law.37
EL properties
To evaluate whether these Ir complexes are suitable for the evaporation deposition method, TGA was performed to detect their decomposition temperatures (Td) corresponding to 5% weight loss. It was found that the introduction of the methoxyl group has little influence on the thermal stability. For example, (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) shows an almost equal Td of 354 °C to (pfupy)2Ir(acac), and (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) exhibits a slightly lower Td of 323 °C (Fig. S5, ESI,† and Table 1). Such a relative high Td above 300 °C can ensure the further thermal-deposited device test for (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) and (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac). Moreover, no obvious glass transition behaviours are observed for (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) and (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) in their DSC curves (inset in Fig. S5, ESI†), meaning the formation of amorphous films during thermal deposition.
Then, we utilized them as the triplet dopants to fabricate PhOLEDs with a structure of ITO/MoO3 (10 nm)/TAPC (60 nm)/TCTA (5 nm)/TCTA: Ir complex (20 nm)/BmPyPB (35 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm). Here, MoO3 and LiF were used as the hole- and electron-injecting layers, respectively; TAPC and BmPyPB were employed as the hole- and electron-transporting layers, respectively; and TCTA was adopted as the electron-blocking layer and the host at the same time (Fig. 5a). The best doping concentration was optimized to be 6 wt% and 4 wt% for (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) and (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac), respectively. As can be clearly seen in Fig. 5b, (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) emits a bright-green EL peak at 524 nm. Compared with the yellowish-green (pfupy)2Ir(acac) (CIE: (0.44, 0.55)), the CIE coordinates of (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) are blue-shifted to (0.37, 0.60) and are closer to the standard viz. (0.30, 0.60) for green light, indicative of the better green color purity. Meanwhile, an orange EL peak at 597 nm is observed for (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac), giving the CIE coordinates (0.60, 0.40).

We note that the turn-on voltage at 1 cd m−2 of (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) is 4.2 V, which is higher than that of (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) (3.2 V). This observation is understandable when considering the large charge injection barrier induced by the wider bandgap of (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) relative to (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac), which is further confirmed by the lower current density at a driving voltage below 6 V. Despite this, high device performance is achieved for the green-emitting (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac), revealing a maximum luminance of 48790 cd m−2, a peak current efficiency of 100.7 cd A−1 and a peak EQE of 29.5%. The orange-emitting (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) gives a maximum luminance of 28885 cd m−2, a peak current efficiency of 43.9 cd A−1 and a peak EQE of 16.7% (Table 2). To our knowledge, the obtained performance is among the best for green38–40 and orange41–43 PhOLEDs.

Conclusions
In summary, we report two new methoxyl-functionalized Ir complexes bearing a furo[3,2-c]pyridine-based C^N ligand. By simply modifying the methoxyl position on the ligand, highly efficient green- and orange-emitting PhOLEDs can be realized at the same time. Compared with (pfupy)2Ir(acac) without any methoxyl group, (4-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) with a methoxyl group at the 4-position shows a blue-shifted green emission of 523 nm accompanied by the CIE coordinates (0.37, 0.60) and a peak EQE of 29.5%, while (3-MeOpfupy)2Ir(acac) with a methoxyl group at the 3-position shows a red-shifted orange emission of 602 nm accompanied by the CIE coordinates (0.60, 0.40) and a peak EQE of 16.7%. We believe that this work will shed light on the great potential of furo[3,2-c]pyridine-based Ir complexes in high-performance PhOLEDs.
