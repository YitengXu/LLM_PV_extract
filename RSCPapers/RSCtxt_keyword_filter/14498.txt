    , Accepted 7th February 2023First published on 7th February 2023AbstractIn recent years, there has been a research boom on halide perovskites (HPs) whose outstanding performance in photovoltaic and optoelectronic fields is obvious to all. In particular, HP materials find application in the development of artificial synapses. HP-based synapses have great potential for artificial neuromorphic systems, which is due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties, femtojoule-level energy consumption, and simple fabrication process. In this review, we present the physical properties of HPs and describe two types of synaptic devices including two-terminal (2T) memristors and three-terminal (3T) transistors. The HP layer in 2T memristors can realize the change in the device conductance through physical mechanisms dominated by ion migration. On the other hand, HPs in 3T transistors can be used as efficient light-absorbing layers and rely on some special device structures to provide reliable current changes. In the final section of the article, we discuss some of the existing applications of HP-based synapses and bottlenecks to be solved.Zhengyang XueZhengyang Xue is currently an undergraduate student studying at the Hunan Key Laboratory for Super Microstructure and Ultrafast Process of Central South University.

1. Introduction
Halide perovskites (HPs) are functional materials consisting of organic cations, alkaline earth metal cations, transition metals, and halogens.1 Thanks to their excellent photovoltaic and optoelectronic properties, HPs are used to fabricate solar cells, photodetectors, and phototransistors.2–12 Since the first HP solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 3.81% reported by A. Kojima et al. in 2009,13 the laboratory efficiency has exceeded 25% today.14 This outstanding result was not only due to the experience accumulated during the work on solar cells over the past few decades, but also owing to the fascinating performance of HPs. Moreover, HPs could be successfully applied in the development of some novel electronic devices, such as resistance random access memory, artificial synapses, etc.15–19
As the demand for data processing capability has substantially increased, the traditional von Neumann architecture has gradually approached the physical limit. In order to solve this bottleneck, scientists have set their sights on the study of the brain.20–24 Compared with traditional silicon-based processors, the human brain is a powerful processing system that can realize storage and computing at the same time with extremely low energy consumption.25,26 The basic building blocks of the brain are neurons and artificial synapses. There are about 1011 neurons in the human brain. Being the connection channels between neurons, synapses ensure that the brain realizes learning and possesses computing capabilities.27 Therefore, the development of artificial synaptic devices is critical for brain-like computing.
In fact, traditional complementary metal oxide semiconductor technologies were successfully used long ago to produce synapses.28 However, because of the complex structure of the device, early artificial synapses exhibited issues associated with low integration and high power consumption. In recent decades, specific device structures, including transistors, phase-change memory and memristors, have been designed to simulate synaptic structures.21,29–36 Materials composing these devices were graphene, metal oxides, and organic materials.37–44 With the introduction of these appliances and new materials, the performance of artificial synapses has been gradually improved, and the energy consumption has approached that of the brain (∼fJ per synaptic event). In the past 10 years, various attempts have also been made to use HP materials in the development of artificial synapses, and great success could be achieved in the production of memristors and transistors. As the active layer in two-terminal (2T) memristors, HPs can change the conductance under the action of an external field to simulate a synapse. This type of device has a simple structure and is easy to integrate. A three-terminal (3T) transistor relies on the modulation of the gate, source and drain to obtain complex structures, wherein HP materials generally play the role of a light absorber. In such structures, the separation and transportation of photogenerated carriers are effectively realized through the appropriate regulation of energy levels within HPs.
This review focuses on the research progress in HP-based artificial synapses. Firstly, we will introduce the basic physical properties and special memristive phenomena of HPs. After that, we will discuss the representative research results on HP-based artificial synapses from the perspectives of memristors and transistors, and summarize some of the applications of these devices. Finally, the future development directions of HP-based artificial synapses will be pointed out.
2. Physical properties of HPs
2.1 Crystal structure, band gap, ion migration, and defects
Unlike common semiconductors, HP-structured compounds exist in the form of ionic crystals, which determines their unique properties. The general chemical formula of a three-dimensional (3D) HP is ABX3, where A represents an organic cation or an alkali metal ion, according to the Goldschmidt tolerance factor:46 (1)
The closer the value of t to 1, the more stable the structure of HPs, so the ionic radii of A-site ions are large, such as methylammonium (MA+), formamidinium (FA+), Cs+, etc.47 In general, when 0.9 < t < 1.0, the unit cell structure of HPs is a 3D cube (Fig. 1a). With the increase of t, the stability of the B–X bond is destroyed, and the HP will be reduced to a two-dimensional (2D) or quasi-2D layered structure (Fig. 1b). The 2D HPs are more stable than 3D HPs and have anisotropic properties, resulting in a natural quantum well effect due to the segmentation of long-chain molecules. Meanwhile, the photoelectric performance of 2D HPs is not as good as that of 3D HPs. The B-site ion of HPs is generally occupied by Pb2+. The Pb2+ ions contribute greatly to the density of states of the conduction band minimum (CBM), which makes the light absorption ability of HP materials surpass that of many inorganic semiconductors such as GaAs.48,49 Nevertheless, because of the toxicity of Pb2+, researchers have tried to replace B-site ions with Sn2+, Bi+, Ag+ and Cu2+,50–54 but finding a lattice-matching method that does not degrade the optical performance of ions is still a challenge. Finally, X represents halogen ions, which include I−, Br−, and Cl−. Such ions have a great influence on the band gap of HPs, and adjusting the ratio of the three halogen elements in the HP material is an effective way to change the band gap.

Fig. 1c shows a summary of the band gaps of some previously reported HP materials (here, VBM stands for the valence band maximum).55–57 From these data, it can be seen that the band gap of HPs shows a trend of EI < EBr < ECl. This is because the electronegativity of metal cations and anions in HP materials can also significantly affect the energy bands. As the electronegativity of the X-site ions increases, the covalent Pb–X bond becomes more stable and the band gap increases. This property provides a certain fault tolerance rate for HP materials. For example, McMeekin et al. pointed out that FA0.83Cs0.17Pb[I(1−x)Brx]3 with x = 0.4 could be used to replace the unstable “black phase” CsPbI3 at room temperature owing to a similar band gap (∼1.73 eV).58
Besides that, X-site ions are also considered the main bearers of ion migration in HPs.59–63 The activation energy is an important basis when discussing ion mobility. The higher the activation energy is, the lower the migration ability will be. Eames et al. calculated the migration activation energy of each ion in a MAPbI3 system,45 and the migration paths are shown in Fig. 1d and e. The results show that the migration activation energies of I−, Pb2+ and MA+ ions are 0.58, 2.31 and 0.84 eV, respectively. Moreover, according to reports, the migration of Pb2+ ions is indeed not as significant as that of I− and can only be detected when the material is completely decomposed.63
In addition to this, the grain boundary (GB) also exerts a great influence on ion migration.64–67 For example, Wu et al. explored the effect of GBs on ion migration.67 They measured multiple current–voltage hysteresis data points near the grain boundaries of MAPbI2Br. Their results showed that the hysteresis of the I–V curve became more obvious when approaching the GBs, which proved that the GBs were indeed the active centers of ion migration.
Another important property of HP materials is a high fault tolerance to defects that conventional semiconductors do not have. Although the deep-level defects in semiconductors can degrade material properties, this phenomenon does not seem to be common for HP materials.68,69 One important reason is that the band gap of the HP material is formed in two sets of antibonding orbitals, that is, there is a lack of coupling between the conduction band and the valence band. This situation leads to the appearance of shallower energy levels. On the other hand, deep-level defects also exist in HP materials, but their formation generally requires a lot of energy.70,71 What's more, this behavior often causes the common n-type or p-type self-doping behavior of HPs,69,72 which impacts the carrier migration of the device. By regulating this self-doping behavior, the application of HPs in optoelectronic devices can be expanded to a large extent.
2.2 Memristive mechanism induced by ion migration in HPs
When HPs are used in solar cells, a current–voltage hysteresis with the scans in different directions and at various rates is often observed, resulting in different I–V curves.73–77 Although this phenomenon is considered a disadvantage for solar cells, it is in line with the design philosophy of memristors. The memristor is the fourth basic circuit element proposed after resistance, capacitance and inductance.78 It refers to a kind of element whose conductance is related to the current flowing through previously. In earlier reports, many possible mechanisms of resistive switching (RS) in HP materials, including material defects, ferroelectric effects and ion migration, have been proposed.79–84 Among them, the electrochemical metallization mechanism (ECM) and the valence change mechanism (VCM) dominated by ion migration are the most recognized.
The ECM refers to the formation of a conductive filament (CF) inside a semiconductor via electrolysis (Fig. 1f).85 Under a positive voltage, the active metal electrode is oxidized to the cation which migrates through the HP layer to the negative electrode, further re-reducing and finally forming CFs in the semiconductor. Then, the memristor switches from the high resistance state (HRS) to a low resistance state (LRS). When the voltage direction is reversed, the CFs are melted by Joule heating, and the state of the memristor returns back to the HRS (Fig. 1g). In the work of Yan et al., they measured the temperature coefficient of the active electrode Al in the LRS and obtained data that were in good agreement with the theory, which provided strong evidence for this mechanism.85 The VCM generally refers to the process in which halide ions move to the top electrode under the action of an applied positive voltage when an inert metal is used as an electrode.86 The halide ion vacancies form a CF, and the device is transformed into the LRS (Fig. 1h). In the opposite process, if a reverse voltage is applied to the device, the halide ions recombine with the vacancies, and the device state is transformed into the HRS, as shown in Fig. 1i. More interestingly, although the plausibility of these memory mechanisms has been demonstrated, the actual formation of the CF may be the result of competition between the ECM and the VCM. Sun et al. prepared MAPbI3-based memristors with Ag as electrodes and found that the contributions of both may be related to the thickness of the HP layer. In their experiments, when the thickness of MAPbI3 is ∼90 nm, both CFs will appear simultaneously.87
However, it should be pointed out that as early as in the research of solar cells, it was found that ion migration would not only cause hysteresis in HP devices, but also cause performance degradation of the devices.88 The hopping of ions at the equilibrium point in the lattice will induce vacancy defects, and too many defects will change the physical and chemical properties of the HP layer, resulting in lattice collapse. Ion migration also induces phase segregation in HPs, which is more common in mixed HP materials.89,90 Although this phenomenon can be restored within a period of time after the external field is removed, their long-term use may still lead to changes in the lattice structure. The ions in the HP layer even have irreversible migration behavior. Zhang et al. pointed out that the ions in the HP layer can cross the interface and enter the hole transport layer.91 Besleaga et al. found that I− in MAPbI2.6Cl0.4 can even cross the interface with the Ag electrode to form the stable compound AgI.92 Frequent operation will definitely accelerate the degradation of the HP layer, and will also reduce the performance of the device itself as a whole. In previous reports, HP-based memristors showed excellent competition in the on–off resistance ratio and switching speed, but their durability was mostly ∼103 cycles.93 Although passivation or adding buffer layers can now properly improve its service life, it will sacrifice other performance indicators of HP-based devices.94,95 For example, the durability of the memristor prepared by Yoo et al. using MA3PbI3−xClx can reach 2 × 104 times and has potential for neural simulation, but its on–off resistance ratio is less than 102.96 Therefore, the discovery of memristor properties brings both opportunities and new challenges to HP materials. How to improve the lifetime of HP-based memristors is an urgent problem to be solved.
3. Artificial synapses
3.1 Synaptic plasticity
Synapses are the connecting channels between neurons, which are composed of a presynaptic membrane, synaptic cleft and postsynaptic membrane (Fig. 2a). When stimulated by an upper synapse or neuron, the presynaptic membrane releases either excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitter will be accepted by the postsynaptic membrane to complete the transmission of information. An important feature of synapses is that the postsynaptic current (PSC) can change with external stimuli during information transmission, which is called synaptic plasticity. Plasticity simulation is particularly important in the development of artificial synapses. Different types of plasticity include short-term plasticity (STP), long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD), spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), spike-rate dependent plasticity (SRDP), spike-number dependent plasticity (SNDP), etc.97–101
 Fig. 2  (a) Comparison of biological synapses with 2T memristors and 3T transistors, respectively. (b) Changes in EPSCs under a pulse applied to the synaptic device. (c) Changes in EPSCs in the case of two consecutive pulses applied to the synaptic device in a short period of time. (d) Changes in EPSCs under multiple consecutive pulses applied to the synaptic device. (e) Relationship between SW changes and the difference Δt between the presynaptic and postsynaptic signal peaks in biological synapses. (f) Changes in EPSCs after applying pulses of different frequencies to the synaptic device (here, LF represents low frequency and HF represents high frequency). 
HP-based appliances used to simulate synapses include memristors and transistors (Fig. 2a). The simplest 2T memristor consists of only the top electrode/HP layer/bottom electrode. By applying pulses to the top electrode, the conductance of the HP layer will be changed, which simulates synaptic weights (SWs). The current flowing through the device represents the EPSC of the synapse. Another appliance, the 3T transistor, is a basic p-type or n-type structure depending on doping materials.102 The gate voltage (Vgs) regulates the ion channels between the drain and the source.103 It should be noted that HPs are rarely used as the channels of transistors, while serving as floating gates or hybridization assembled with another semiconductor into a heterojunction, which will be discussed in detail in Section 3.3.
When a positive pulse is applied to the top electrode (Vt) of the memristor or the gate voltage Vgs of the synaptic transistor, a sharp increase in the EPSC peak can be observed (see Fig. 2b). After the pulse is removed, the EPSC of the device changes slowly until disappearing, which reflects the STP of the synapse. If two short-spaced positive pulses are continuously applied to the device, two consecutively increasing peaks can be obtained (Fig. 2c). This phenomenon successfully models the paired pulse-promoted plasticity (PPF), which can be measured by the ratio of two peaks: PPFratio = A1/A2(2)
The PPF index is a very important parameter for evaluating synaptic performance, which is related to the inter-pulse time. If a series of positive pulses are continuously applied to the device, more consecutive rising peaks arise and EPCS remains at a high level for a longer period of time after the pulse is removed (Fig. 2d). At this time, synaptic plasticity undergoes a transformation from STP to LTP. These two behaviors can be macroscopically analogous to forgetting in the biological brain, where STP corresponds to short-term memory (STM) and LTP refers to long-term memory (LTM).
STDP, also known as the Hebbian research rule,98 states that the impulse SW is increased or decreased by the difference Δt between the presynaptic and postsynaptic signal peaks (Fig. 2e). Meanwhile, the effect of this plasticity is greatly diminished beyond a certain range. SRDP refers to the induction of different SWs by applying pulses of different frequencies (Fig. 2f). Studying these functions allows one to better understand the brain's activity.
3.2 2T-memristor synapses

3.2.1 2T-memristor synapses dominated by ion migration. 
In 2016, Xu et al. used HPs to produce a 2T synaptic device104 in the form of a substrate/buffer-capped conducting polymer (BCCP) electrode/MAPbBr3/top electrode heterostructure (Fig. 3a). The device successfully simulated the basic synaptic features including EPSCs, PPF, STP, LTP, and STDP. Applying electrical pulses to the electrodes induced ion migration in the HP layer, thereby changing the conductance of the synapse (Fig. 3b), which imitated an STP. When more continuous pulses were applied to the electrodes, Br− entered the BCCP layer, producing vacancy defects in the HP layer. The conductance of the device remained stable for a long period of time, and the STP was converted into LTP. This synaptic power consumption was only ∼20 fJ due to the low operating current of MAPbBr3. This is the first time a HP material has been used in artificial synapses. Since then, various structures, such as MAPbI3, FAPbBr3 and MAPbClBr2, have been reported continuously in this field of research.108–110 Xiao et al. fabricated a MAPbI3-based artificial synapse with an extremely low energy consumption of 55 fJ.110 This device not only successfully achieved much synaptic plasticity, but also provided a chance that might be used for the light-assisted readout of synaptic function. Yu et al. investigated the synaptic properties of mixed HPs.105 Upon testing the 2T devices with MAPbBr3 and MAPbClBr2 as active materials (Fig. 3c), they found that the change of the halogen would have exerted a significant impact on EPSCs (Fig. 3d). A possible reason for this difference is that the migration activation energies of Cl− and Br− are different. In particular, ions with smaller activation energies migrate more easily, thus producing larger EPSCs. This also leads to the higher energy consumption (∼5.8 pJ) of MAPbClBr2-based artificial synapses.

2D HPs are also widely used in the fabrication of artificial synapses,83,111–114 whose properties are similar to those of 3D HPs. For example, Tian et al. successfully simulated synapses using PEA2PbBr4 (here, PEA represents phenethylammonium) and observed the conduction path formed by Br− migration in the HP layer, which confirmed the role of ion migration in the memristive mechanism.114 However, the 2D HP layered structure restricts the ion transport in the vertical direction, which makes its anisotropy different from that of 3D HPs.8,115–119 Kim et al. recently reported an Au/PEA2MA2Pb3I10/ITO structure to mimic synapses.106 Unlike the common layered structures, the middle HP layer in the above system was arranged vertically (Fig. 3e). This device exhibited resistance switching by inducing the formation of iodine vacancies (VI). To determine the appropriate migration paths for iodide ions, the migration energies of the three paths in PEA2MA2Pb3I10 were calculated. As can be seen from Fig. 3f, the energy moving vertically across the PbI6 surface was the lowest (0.96 eV). Based on this, a synaptic device based on the vertically aligned 2D HP (VHP) was fabricated, which successfully simulated the LTP, STP, spike-width dependent plasticity (SWDP) and spike-voltage dependent plasticity (SVDP) of the synapse. This work opened up new prospects for the development of artificial synapses by rationally exploiting the anisotropy of 2D HPs, allowing one to further improve the performance of synapses.
Compared with organic HP materials, an inorganic halide perovskite (IHP) CsPbI3 exhibits excellent performance at low cost. However, reports on IHP-based artificial synapses are still scarce. One reason is that CsPbI3 easily changes from the most stable black phase to a non-perovskite yellow phase at room temperature,120–123 which requires higher voltages to achieve a synaptic behavior. In order to solve this problem, attempts were made to stabilize the “black phase” via various routes such as doping, blending, and nanocrystal formation.120,124,125 Kim et al. fabricated a biphasic Ag/polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)/(Cs3Bi2I9)0.4-(CsPbI3)0.6/Pt perovskite device (Fig. 3g).107 The device successfully demonstrated the common synaptic features, including STP, LTP, STDP, and SWDP. According to the authors, the conductance change of the device was related to the ECM mechanism, and the Ag CFs were also observed in the IHP layer. To investigate the stability of this biphasic HP, the I–V scan curves of the device were monitored over 30 days in air (Fig. 3h), suggesting that biphasic HP-based synapses were stable in air for about a week at least.

Table 1 presents the information on HPs proposed over the past years, including materials themselves, synaptic functions and applications. From the table, it can also be seen that a class of B-site lead-free alternative materials have been frequently reported recently, which has important research significance for solving the toxicity of HP materials. In addition, these materials also have some attractive properties, such as flexibility,126–128 stability,128–130etc. However, data concerning the energy consumption of these lead-free synapses are rarely disclosed. This may be because the research studies on lead-free HP-based artificial synapses are not perfect, which requires us to continue to explore in the future.

3.2.2 Light-regulated 2T memristor synapses. 
The memristive properties of HPs can be used to fabricate electrically modulated artificial synapses. However, in a real environment, the brain may simultaneously process information from different aspects such as smell, light, and sound. To further improve the simulation capabilities, the light was introduced into the synapse as one of the regulatory factors (Fig. 4a). Inspired by the chemical regulation of dopamine in the human brain, Ham et al. fabricated an Ag/MAPbI3/ITO structure with light-assisted electrical modulation of the artificial synapse.143 In this structure, dopamine can lower the threshold of LTP by modulating synaptic plasticity (Fig. 4b), which improves the adaptive and learning abilities of the human brain. The excellent photoelectric effect of MAPbI3 enables the related artificial synapses to mimic the regulatory role of dopamine. Under simultaneous application of electrical and optical signals to the device (Fig. 4c), the EPSC reaches a maximum when both signal peaks match each other. The reason for this phenomenon is that the migration of VI is accelerated under light conditions. This device can achieve some simple synaptic plasticity, such as STP, LTP and LTD. However, it can be found from the test structure in Fig. 4d that the synaptic plasticity transition from STP to LTP only under light conditions is a challenge.

Lao et al. fabricated KI-MAPbI3-based artificial synapses (Fig. 4e), and the addition of KI improved the growth of crystals in MAPbI3 films.144 To reflect the effect of light on synaptic performance, they plotted the conductance as a function of pulse number at different light intensities (see Fig. 4f. In all cases, the pulses had a period of 2 ms and an amplitude of 0.5 V). On the whole, with an increase of the number of pulses, the conductance gradually increased, being at the highest level at a light intensity of 0.63 mW cm−2. This device also successfully realized more synaptic plasticity outcomes including PPF, SNDP, SRDP, and SVDP.

3.3 3T-synaptic transistors
HP materials are also widely used in the development of 3T devices, and Table 2 provides a summary of their materials, synaptic functions and applications. However, pure HP materials are generally not applied directly to transistor channels because higher operating voltages are often required at this time. In practice, HPs mainly serve as floating gate layers or form heterojunctions with organic materials to absorb light and separate charges.

3.3.1 3T synaptic transistors using HPs as a floating gate layer. 
The floating gate structure can be seen as an improvement of the traditional field effect transistor. The floating gate layer is generally wrapped by a dielectric layer and an insulating layer so as to capture the charges entering through the band bending or the tunneling effect. Even after the disappearance of the external electric field, the potential barrier from the dielectric layer prevents these carriers from escaping, which effectively prolongs their lifetime.
This idea was used to make artificial synapses. A classic example is the report of Wang et al. who fabricated a 3T optoelectronic synapse using a Si/SiO2/CsPbBr3 quantum dots (QDs)/PMMA/pentacene/Au structure (Fig. 5a).145 In this device, CsPbBr3 QDs serve as the floating gate layer of the transistor, which successfully realizes both photoprogramming and electrical erasing (Fig. 5b). When a light pulse is applied to the device, there are photogenerated carriers in the CsPbBr3 layer, among which the holes can move toward the semiconductor layer under the action of energy band bending, so that numerous electrons stay in the floating gate layer, which effectively delays the recombination of photogenerated carriers. If a reverse voltage is applied to the device to increase the ground potential of the floating gate layer, the holes in the semiconductor layer will recombine with electrons in CsPbBr3 to achieve the function of electrical erasing. The alternating use of these two signals allows the device to acquire complex synaptic functions (Fig. 5c).

Wang et al. used lead-free CsBi3I10 as the HP material mixed with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a floating gate layer to trap charges (Fig. 5d).153 Thanks to the excellent optoelectronic properties of CsBi3I10, the related device exhibited an obvious photoresponse at a bias voltage of −0.01 V (Fig. 5e). It has been successfully used to simulate artificial synapses, including STP, PPD, PPF, LTP and so on. As shown in Fig. 5f, 30 identical pulses continuously applied to the device with an interval of 0.2 s made the EPSC basically change in a linear manner, indicating that the device would also have great potential for application in the field of storage or programming.


3.3.2 3T synaptic transistors in a bulk or planar heterojunction. 
Floating-gate HP-based transistors have been successfully used in synapse simulations with superior optoelectronic properties. However, the fabrication of the floating gate structure leads to a relatively complicated process, which is not suitable for large-scale development. According to recent reports, the appropriately adjusted energy level structure between HPs and organic semiconductors enabled the efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers, which would have caused the photogate effect to delay the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Hao et al. have chosen to mix poly [2,5-(2-octyldodecyl)-3,6-diketopyrrolopyrrole-alt-5,5-(2,5-di(thien-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene)] (DPPDTT) and CsPbBr3 QDs to fabricate a bulk heterojunction (Fig. 6a).146 The application of the optical signal also induced the generation of carriers in CsPbBr3 QDs, but due to the existence of the energy level barrier, the photogenerated holes entered DPPDTT and the electrons were trapped in CsPbBr3 QDs, which could delay the disappearance of the current. Fig. 6b shows that the device used to simulate the conversion of a brain-produced STM into the LTM. If a series of pulses is twice applied to the appliance in a short period of time, the memory–forget–re-remember learning curve is similar to that of the human brain (Fig. 6c). More interestingly, this device not only successfully realizes the basic properties of synapses at a voltage of −0.2 V, but also exhibits synaptic responses at a voltage of −0. 5 mV, resulting in very low power losses (∼0.5 fJ).

Besides that, HPs can be assembled into planar heterojunctions with organic materials for use in synaptic transistors. Liu et al. reported an artificial synapse based on a heterostructure of island-like CsPbBr3 and 6,13-bis (triisopropylsilylethynyl) (TIPS)-pentacene (TIPS-pentacene simply referred to as TIPS), namely a Si/SiO2/CsPbBr3/TIPS/Au structure (Fig. 6d).147 The heterostructure of CsPbBr3 and TIPS could significantly improve the photosensitive performance of the device (Fig. 6e). At the interface, the energy level difference accelerated the separation of photogenerated carriers since the conduction band minimum of TIPS was lower than that of CsPbBr3. The device could adjust the recombination time of photogenerated carriers by changing the magnitude of Vgs, and the smaller the Vgs value, the longer the recombination time. This was because the larger gate voltage compressed the width of the potential barrier between CsPbBr3 and TIPS, which enhanced the electron tunneling effect (Fig. 6f).

4. Applications
HP-based artificial synapses, including individual synapses and integrated devices, have many interesting properties, which make them promising for applications in brain-like algorithms and artificial intelligence.
4.1 Artificial neural networks
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are an abstraction of the biological brain information processing ways. A schematic diagram of ANNs is shown in Fig. 7a. An ANN has a three-layer structure, including an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer, which are connected by a synaptic structure.154–156 Once the signal Xi received at the input exceeds a certain threshold, an action potential will be transmitted to the next level, and its value will be modulated by the weight factor Wij between the two levels of connections. Therefore, the magnitude of the signal received by the neuron is derived from the weighted summation of the action potentials of all the upper-level neurons as: Yj = ΣXi·Wij, and the neuron is responsible for processing the signal. The way of data processing endows the ANNs with excellent learning ability, robustness, and fault tolerance.157–159 During ANN development, particular attention from researchers has been paid to the crossed arrays, while such an array structure can greatly improve the integration density. In that regard, artificial synapses were used to connect the output and input layers, and the SW was represented by the conductance size of the synapse (Fig. 7b and c).

(d) ANNs with a three-layer structure designed by Kim et al. (e) Testing of ANNs for image recognition using MNIST. Reproduced with permission.106 Copyright 2022, Materials Today. 
The application of HP materials in the development of ANNs has been frequently reported.106,130,136 For example, the light-triggered 2T synapse designed by Ham et al. performed excellently in the MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) test. Moreover, the energy consumption was reduced by about 2600 times when using the photoelectric signal together with the electrical pulse. Poddar et al. used MA3Bi2I9 nanowire arrays to identify the missing letters,136 extending the application of HP materials in the simulation of complex neural functions. The most interesting example is a VHP-based ANN with a three-layer structure developed by Kim et al.106 It consists of crossed arrays of word and bit lines connected by the artificial synapses with a VHP in the middle to simulate neurons (see Fig. 7d). Such ANNs follow the back-propagation algorithm and are used for learning from the MNIST (Fig. 7e). The accuracy rate reaches 86% after 60000 training sets and 10000 test sets. The authors have also pointed out that the performance of ANNs with this structure is superior to other neural networks with crossed arrays because of the low noise and high linearity of the VHP.
4.2 Artificial vision
The formation process of vision is shown in Fig. 8a. After the light enters the eyeball, it is converted by the photoreceptor cells on the retina into an electrical signal which is then sent to the visual cortex of the brain through the optic nerve. The electrical signals are processed by the cerebral cortex to form vision. In this link, photoreceptor cells include rod cells and cone cells, which cooperate with each other to recognize the intensity, wavelength, dynamics and other characteristics of light.161–164 Photosensitive synapses can act as photoreceptor cells, which is shown by the example of a device developed by Parker et al. from a two-layer structure of BA2PbBr4 and indium zinc tin oxide (IZTO) to accept optical signals.151 While the HP acts as a light absorption layer, the excited carriers flow into the IZTO layer to realize the change in conductance. They used a 5-by-5 synaptic array to identify letters, and the grayscale in the picture represents the size of the EPSC (Fig. 8b). As can be seen from the figure, before the optical pulse is applied, each device presents the HRS. Once “N”-type photostimulation (365 nm, 100 mW cm−2, 30 s) is realized on the synapses, a distinct N-type imprinting is seen in the array, and the device maintains a clear memory for up to 300 s. This feature can be used to simulate the visual residue, which is an important function of the human eye to achieve dynamic recognition.

According to recent reports, there is a variety of HP materials used in the development of artificial vision devices (see Table 3). As seen from the table, the operating wavelengths of these devices are mainly concentrated in the range of 360–660 nm, which needs to be further extended.

4.3 Logical operations
Artificial synapses can be applied to the logic operations by judging whether the EPSC reaches a preset threshold. As shown in Fig. 8c, a value of 0.05 μA was set by Gong et al. as the threshold,160 and as soon as the light intensity reached 1.8 mW cm−2, one pulse remained below the threshold, but two pulses could make the EPSC exceed 0.05 μA, that is, the logical “AND” was realized. When the light intensity was increased to 6.5 mW cm−2, one pulse was enough for the EPSC to surpass the threshold, thus achieving a logical “OR” (Fig. 8d).
In contrast, Hao et al. fixed the gate voltage and used two optical signals of different wavelengths (450 and 500 nm) to adjust the current flowing through the device.146 The current threshold was set at 5 nA. When the incident light intensity was weak (0.12 mW cm−2), the EPSC could reach the threshold only if two signals were applied simultaneously (Fig. 8e). Once the incident light intensity was increased to 0.3 mW cm−2, one light input could make the EPSC reach the threshold (Fig. 8f). These results underlay simple methods for the implementation of these two logic operations, opening up new prospects for the development of more complex logic operations.
5. Summary and outlook
This review summarizes the research progress in the field of HP-based artificial synapses, mainly focusing on their physical properties, related device structures, working mechanisms and applications. Special memristive properties and excellent light-absorbing characteristics of HP materials have made them applicable to the development of artificial synapses. Meanwhile, there are still some challenges that cannot be ignored.
The first problem is that, compared with other materials, there are quite limited reports on the physical properties of HP artificial synapses, including flexibility, stability, and biocompatibility. The lead-free HPs seem to have certain potential from these aspects, but these materials are currently not more competitive than Pb-containing HPs in terms of their overall performance. Thus, it is recommended that researchers continue investigations in this area. The second issue involves device structure peculiarities. In particular, a 2T device memristor has a simple structure and is easy to integrate. However, the physical principle of its memristive mechanism has not been thoroughly explored, and no reliable regulation method for this memristive phenomenon, further improving the performance of memristor synapses, has been proposed to date. In turn, 3T synaptic devices exhibit more precise control functions through the gate. Meanwhile, the development of 3T devices requires HP materials to be mainly introduced as light absorbing layers, which makes the appliance fabrication process more complicated. Besides, the reports on the direct use of HP materials for transistor channels, as well as their synaptic behavior, are still scarce,166 which is a gap that needs to be filled in the future.
Overall, extensive research on HP-based neural devices was started a short time ago, but the results achieved to date are exciting. Therefore, we have reason to believe that HPs will achieve further breakthroughs in the nearest future.
