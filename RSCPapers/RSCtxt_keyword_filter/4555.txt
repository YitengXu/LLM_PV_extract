    , Accepted 10th May 2013First published on 10th May 2013AbstractDue to the energy crisis within recent decades, renewable energies such as solar, wind and tide energies have received a lot of attention. However, these renewable energies are dependent on the time and season. Consequently, energy storage systems are needed to fully utilize these energies including their connection with smart grids. Aqueous rechargeable lithium batteries (ARLBs) may be an ideal energy storage system due to its excellent safety and reliability. However, since the introduction of ARLBs in 1994, the progress on improving their performance has been very limited. Recently, their rate performance, especially superfast charging performance, reversible capacity and cycling life of their electrode materials were markedly improved. The present work reviews the latest advances in the exploration of the electrode materials and the development of battery systems. Also the main challenges in this field are briefly commented on and discussed.Yuping WuDr Yuping Wu is a professor at Fudan University, Shanghai, China. Since 1994, he has published over 200 peer-reviewed papers, written five monographs, whose sales are above 23000 copies, and 3 chapters, translated one book, and has 20 issued patents. H-Index is 32. His research has led to the creation of three companies on anode materials, cathode materials and power lithium ion batteries, respectively. His research is mainly focused on lithium ion batteries, supercapacitors, other new energy storage and conversion systems and solar hydrogen.

Broader context
For large-scale energy storage systems, their safety and reliability are more challenging than those required for electric vehicles. New rechargeable batteries are urgently needed. It has been well realized that an aqueous electrolyte is one of the safest choices for rechargeable batteries. In addition, the ionic conductivity of aqueous electrolytes is higher than those of nonaqueous and solid electrolytes, which is one prerequisite for a fast redox reaction, i.e., fast charge and discharge processes. In the case of aqueous rechargeable lithium batteries (ARLBs), the first was invented in 1994. Only until recently has great progress been achieved. The main reasons are ascribed to the nanostructuring and surface coating on their electrode materials. The reversible capacities of their electrode materials are markedly increased, which can be similar to those achieved in organic electrolytes. Their cycling life is excellent. For example, in the case of LiMn2O4, its capacity retention can be 93% after 10000 full cycles. In addition, their electrode materials and the ARLBs can be charged at a super fast rate, which is comparable with gasoline filling for car engines. These progresses show that ARLBs provide another promising choice as a power source for smart grids and hybrid electric vehicles, and can assist the power sources of electric vehicles and range-extenders.

Recently, energy shortages and environment pollution have became serious issues due to the development of the economy and the increase in population. As a result, renewable energies such as solar, wind and tide energies have received a lot of attention. However, these renewable energies are dependent on the time and season. Consequently, energy storage systems are urgently needed to fully utilize these energies, including their connection with smart grids.1–4
Lithium ion batteries have been well acknowledged as an energy storage system of high energy density.1 However, their safety and superfast charging performance are still two challenging issues to be solved for their use as large-scale energy storage systems in electric vehicles and smart grids since a large amount of combustible organic electrolytes is used and the ionic conductivity of the organic electrolyte is about 2 orders of magnitudes lower than those of the aqueous ones.1 As a result, new energy storage systems of high reliability and rapid charging are urgently needed.
Aqueous rechargeable lithium batteries (ARLBs) use lithium intercalation compound(s) as one or two electrodes based on redox reactions and a lithium-containing aqueous solution as the electrolyte. As to hybrid supercapacitors based on one electrode from absorption/desorption, they should not be ascribed into the category of batteries since only one electrode is based on the redox reaction. ARLBs can overcome some disadvantages of lithium ion batteries, i.e., the high cost, safety problems and environment pollution problem of Pb-acid or Ni–Cd batteries, to satisfy the demands of a grid-scale application.3–7 Moreover, the ionic conductivities of the aqueous electrolytes are much higher than those of the organic ones and a high power density could be expected. This makes the ARLBs act as an assisting system in smart grids. However, since their birth in 1994, their practical applications have been obstructed due to their poor cycling, not so good rate capability and low energy density. Recently, their cycling and rate capability have been greatly improved due to the exploration of new methods and materials,5–15 and they have become a hot topic again.
In this mini-review, we briefly describe the advantages and challenges associated with ARLBs, with emphasis put on the electrochemical performance of various electrode materials including cathode materials such as LiMn2O4,16–25 LiCoO2,10,26,27 LiNiO2,28 LiFePO4,29–31 and some anode materials such as vanadium compounds,5,16,32–40 LiTi2(PO4)3,41,42 modified MoO3 and V2O5,8,11 which are primarily listed in Table 1. The main focus is on the high capacity, excellent cycling and superfast charging capability.43–45

1 Cathode materials
Currently, LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, LiFePO4 and Li[Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3]O2 are used as a cathode materials in over 90% of lithium ion batteries based on intercalation and de-intercalation reactions accompanying the gain and loss of electrons.46–59 In aqueous electrolytes, lithium intercalation and de-intercalation can also occur in/from these electrodes as in organic electrolytes,24,27,30,46 and their main performance is primarily summarized in Table 2.

1.1 LiCoO2
The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of LiCoO2 in a saturated Li2SO4 aqueous solution and in an organic electrolyte are shown in Fig. 1. Since their reference electrodes are different, their voltages are different. Both of them show three couples of well-defined current peaks in the CV curves. In the aqueous solution, the main redox peaks are situated at 0.71 and 0.87 V (vs. saturated calomel electrode: SCE), respectively, which agree well with the intercalation/de-intercalation reactions of LiCoO2 in the organic electrolyte. It also shows that there is no problem observed for the de-intercalating of Li+ ions from the LiCoO2 host before the evolution of oxygen in neutral aqueous solutions. By combining these results with those from the CV curve of LiCoO2 in the organic electrolyte, it can be concluded that the electrochemical behavior of the lithium ions in the LiCoO2 lattice in the aqueous electrolyte is similar to that in the organic electrolyte.26

1.2 LiMn2O4
As to LiMn2O4, it can be seen from Fig. 2 that there are two redox couples at the scan rate of 1 mV s−1, which are situated at 0.86/0.68 V and 1.00/0.83 V (vs. SCE), respectively. They correspond to the intercalation and de-intercalation of Li+ ions into/from the spinel host structure in the aqueous electrolyte.18,24,25,60–66 At the higher scan rate, the redox peaks in the aqueous electrolyte maintain a good shape, which is much better than that in the organic electrolyte. In the case of the latter, when the scan rate is increased to 2 mV s−1, the two couples of redox peaks could not be differentiated.66 This indicates that an aqueous electrolyte is favorable for superfast redox kinetics due to the higher ionic conductivity.

1.3 Other cathode materials

Fig. 3 presents the typical CV curves of LiFePO4 electrodes in 1 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. For the LiFePO4 electrode, there is only one couple of broad redox peaks at 0.495/−0.270 V (vs. SCE) with a peak potential separation of 0.765 V. However, LiFePO4 undergoes a reversible redox process and its redox peaks overlaps very well in eight CV cycles.31

The typical CV curve of a Li[Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3]O2 electrode in the saturated Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte (Fig. 4) shows that there are a pair of redox peaks located at 0.68 and 0.48 V (vs. SCE), corresponding to the de-intercalation and intercalation of Li+ ions from/into Li[Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3]O2, respectively. This suggests that it is also possible to reversibly de-intercalate and intercalate the lithium ions from this host before the evolution of oxygen.36
 Fig. 4  CV curve of Li[Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3]O2 in saturated Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte, which is modified from ref. 36. 
However, in theory, there are still some materials which could be used as cathode materials of ARLBs, while their redox reactions in aqueous electrolytes could not reversibly occur without additional treatment. Hitherto, to our best knowledge, there is only one report that focuses on the electrochemical behavior of LiNiO2 in aqueous electrolyte. The appearance of one couple of strong and stable redox peaks in its typical CV curves in LiOH solutions of different concentrations indicates that the de-intercalation and intercalation of cations takes place during the faradaic redox reaction. At a low concentration of the electrolyte (0.02 M LiOH), there are a couple of redox peaks located at 0.2 and 0.76 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), respectively. With the increase in the concentration of the electrolyte, the cathodic peak is shifted towards a negative potential, while the anodic one is shifted towards a positive potential. For the electrolytes of the higher concentrations (0.05 and 0.1 M), the cathodic peak tends to disappear.28
LiNiPO4 belongs to the olivine type family of formula LiMPO4 (M = Fe, Mn, Co or Ni). An initial open-circuit voltage of about 1 V (vs. Sn) is measured for the LiNiPO4 electrode. The cell voltage profile of the LiNiPO4 cathode in a LiOH electrolyte exhibits an evident couple of redox peaks at −0.231/−0.094 V (vs. Hg/HgO), respectively. It is harder to intercalate lithium ions than to de-intercalate, resulting in a lower discharge capacity of 55 mA h g−1.67,68 As to LiMnPO4, its theoretical capacity is 170 mA h g−1 in non-aqueous electrolytes.69 It can deliver a charge capacity of 90 mA h g−1 and suffer from much higher polarization during the redox reactions in an aqueous LiOH electrolyte.46 Addition of additives such as TiS2, TiB2, Bi2O3 and GeO2 into the cathode materials could slightly improve its electrochemical performance. What is more, these inorganic additives also play important roles in improving the electrochemical performance of MnO2 and other cathode materials.69–71
1.4 Rate capability
From the above comparison of the CV curves of the cathode materials in aqueous and organic elctrolytes, it is clear that the current response and the reversibility of the redox behaviors in the aqueous electrolytes are better than those in the organic electrolytes due to the higher ionic conductivities. What is more, a perfect rate capability of ARLBs should be achieved to satisfy its application in large-scale energy storage systems.
Porous LiMn2O4, consisting of nanograins (Fig. 5a), is prepared by using polystyrene (PS) as the template.23 In terms of the rate capability (Fig. 5b and c), the solid LiMn2O4, which is prepared by a traditional solid-state reaction with an average particle size of about 500 nm, presents a discharge capacity of only 20.1 mA h g−1 when the current density increases to 10000 mA g−1. In contrast, the porous LiMn2O4 exhibits excellent rate behavior and displays a reversible capacity of 108 and 90.0 mA h g−1 at the charge/discharge current densities of 5000 and 10000 mA g−1, respectively. When it is charged at the low current density of 100 mA g−1, its discharge capacity fades a little at the discharge current density from 500 to 10000 mA g−1 (Fig. 5d). This is related to the smaller electrochemical resistance and reduced polarization of the porous LiMn2O4.23

Recent studies on lithium intercalation materials have paid much attention to nanostructured materials with various morphologies, such as nanotubes,72 nanowires,73–75 nanorods,25,76 nanosheets, 37,77 and so forth. There is no doubt that the nanostructured materials provide short diffusion pathways for the intercalation/de-intercalation of lithium ions into/from host materials, while the high specific surface area often provides more channels for the intercalation/de-intercalation.8,9,11,12,32,78,79 Consequently, the rate capability will be greatly improved.

Fig. 6 compares the electrochemical behavior of LiCoO2 with different particle sizes in the aqueous electrolytes.6,27 For the micrometer LiCoO2 particle, its reversible capacity is only 120 mA h g−1 at 0.2 C rate. At a 10 C rate, its discharge capacity will decrease to about 80 mA h g−1.6 In the case of the LiCoO2 nanoparticles (about 100 nm), they show a reversible capacity of 143, 135 and 133 mA h g−1 at the constant current densities of 1000 mA g−1 (7 C), 5000 mA g−1 (35 C) and 10000 mA g−1 (70 C), respectively, between 0 and 1.05 V.27 The charge capacity at 70 C is 93% of that at 7 C, which means that to achieve a 93% capacity the required time will be less than one minute. It is clear that nanomaterials can greatly promote the development of ARLBs, including the reversible capacity and the rate capability.27,61–65

The morphologies of some nanostructured LiMn2O4 is shown in Fig. 7 and their electrochemical performances are shown in Fig. 8. The LiMn2O4 nanochains and nanorods can be clearly recognized in Fig. 7. The peak separation in their CV curves increases with the scan rate due to the overpotentials. Their redox peaks retain the well-defined shape even when the scan rate increases to 20 mV s−1, which is much higher than that in the organic electrolytes. They are also much better than the traditional micrometer spinel LiMn2O4.18,24,66 It seems that the nanorods are much better than the nanochains. The former can still present two couples of redox peaks even at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1.27 The reversible capacity of the LiMn2O4 nanochains is 110 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1 (about 4.5 C),24 which is competitive with those in the organic electrolyte.49,50 When the current density increases, the reversible capacity decreases only a little. When the cut-off charge voltage increases to 1.4 V (Fig. 8c), a capacity of 92.6 mA h g−1 (84% of the capacity) could be obtained even at 136 C (about 26 s).24 In the case of the LiMn2O4 nanorods, they can deliver a high capacity of 110 mA h g−1 at 4.5 C and possess very good capacity retention at the superfast charge and discharge rates. They present 97 and 95 mA h g−1 at 5000 (45.5 C) and 10000 mA g−1 (91 C), respectively, between 0 and 1.05 V. The capacity at 91 C is 86% of that at 4.5 C, suggesting that the 86% capacity can be charged at about 40 seconds.24 What is more, the flat plateaus in the charge and discharge curves are maintained at the current densities from 500 to 10000 mA g−1 and the potential drop is very small at high current densities up to 10000 mA g−1,27 which is very rare.

The curves (a) and (c) are from ref. 24 and the curves (b) and (d) are from ref. 25. 
Single crystalline spinel LiMn2O4 nanowires can be synthesized by a hydrothermal method at 205 or 215 °C.75 The initial discharge capacity decreases slightly at several limited discharging rates. Because of the quite low temperature heat-treatment, which may be important for the retention of uniform nanostructure, the crystallinity of the as-prepared materials is not high enough to undergo long cycling. It is believed that the crystallinity should be at least moderate for the rapid intercalation and de-intercalation of Li+ ions in the aqueous electrolytes.
Almost all the published results demonstrate that a perfect rate capability could be obtained by using nanomaterials as the cathode. It is clear that the Li+ ions have a short and direct path to realize the transportation through the electrodes thus avoiding ion depletion or concentration gradients that can degrade the cathode performance, especially at high rates.1,5,7–9,43,61,73–75
Besides the methods of nanostructuring, there are some other solutions for improving the rate capability of the cathode materials for the ARLBs. Heteroatom doping and intermingling with some electronic conductive materials such as MWCNTs (multi-wall carbon nanotubes), and so forth, have received lots of attention. Al- and Ni-doped LiMn2O4 materials were demonstrated to improve the rate capability and the reversibility at high scan rates,13 which could be another way to guarantee that the electrode works at superfast charge rates. As is well known, the MWCNTs can not only increase the electronic conductivity but also play an important role in improving the Li+ diffusion during the electrochemical reaction.63–65,79–83 The electronic conductivity of the hybrid of LiMn2O4 and MWCNTs with a three-dimensional network structure is 0.108 S cm−1, which is five orders of magnitudes larger than that of virginal LiMn2O4 from solid state method.1 In addition, the MWCNTs also decrease its crystallite size and the charge transfer resistance. When the current density reaches 1500 mA g−1, the capacity of the hybrid decreases to 75% of that at 100 mA g−1 and the virginal LiMn2O4 only delivers 18.2 mA h g−1.19
In the case of LiFePO4, its nanoparticles have also been observed to improve the rate capability in aqueous electrolytes. Its particle size ranges from 300 to 500 nm, which means it could be categorized as a nanomaterial. Its rate capability has been improved compared with that in the organic electrolyte.54 In 0.5 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolyte it delivers a discharge capacity of 141 mA h g−1 at a 1 C rate and 110 mA h g−1 at a 20 C rate, corresponding to a capacity retention of 78%. While in the 1 M LiPF6 solution of propylene carbonate, LiFePO4 delivers a capacity of 130 mA h g−1 at 1 C and 58 mA h g−1 at 20 C, corresponding to a capacity retention of only 45%.29–31 This also shows the evident advantage of superfast electrochemical reactions for the aqueous electrolytes over the organic electrolytes.
So far, there is still no report on the fast charging performance of Li[Ni1/3Co1/3Mn1/3]O2 in aqueous electrolytes. However, it is clear that it can be charged and discharged much faster than in organic electrolytes from the behavior of LiCoO2,27 LiMn2O4,23–25 and LiFePO4.54
1.5 Cycling stability
As mentioned above, since the birth of ARLBs in 1994,1,3,4 progress on improving their cycling life has been very limited.8,14,23 Recently, some breakthroughs on its cycling life have been achieved. At the same time, some theories about its fading mechanism have been investigated. The main reason for the capacity fading of cathode materials is structural distortion during the charge/discharge process.14,19,22,23,29 Porous nanostructured materials and electronic conductors have been introduced to reduce the polarization and absorb the structural strain/stress.
In the case of the micrometer LiCoO2, after 100 cycles, less than 10% of the capacity fades, indicating that LiCoO2 is stable during the intercalation/de-intercalation of Li+ ions in aqueous solution.6 When the LiCoO2 nanoparticles (about 100 nm) were tested, there was no evident capacity fading during the initial 40 cycles,27 suggesting that some strain can be alleviated by nanostructuring.
As to LiMn2O4, its nanochains and nanorods also exhibit good cycling performance. The former presents no evident capacity fading after 200 cycles at 4.5 C,24and the latter can retain 94% capacity after 1200 full cycles at 4.5 C.25 The reason for this is similar to that for the nanostructured LiCoO2.27 However, it is more interesting for the porous LiMn2O4 in terms of cycling performance. The porous LiMn2O4 presents an excellent capacity retention (Fig. 9), with no more than a 7% capacity loss after 10000 full cycles at 9 C (1000 mA g−1).23 Such a result is markedly superior to those reported in organic electrolytes.48–52 If the ARLB is charged and discharged once every day, it means that its life span can be at least 30 years, which is of great attraction. In contrast, the discharge capacity of the solid LiMn2O4 electrode decreases rapidly at the first 2000 cycles. Only 19.8 mA h g−1 is retained after 10000 cycles. There are several reasons for the perfect cycling performance of porous LiMn2O4: (1) it possesses a high crystallinity, which is comparable to that of the solid LiMn2O4. The high crystallinity is necessary to ensure the structure stability during cycling.7,23 (2) The porous structure could provide a short diffusion pathway for Li+ ions, improve the electrode/electrolyte contact, facilitate the de-intercalation/intercalation of Li+ ions, enhance the utilization efficiency of the material, and reduce the polarization.8–11,23 (3) The porous structure can accommodate the strain/stress during the charge and discharge process from Jahn–Teller effects.23 (4) There is no acid like HF, which is usually present in the organic electrolytes.23
 Fig. 9  Cycling behavior of the porous and solid LiMn2O4 in 0.5 M Li2SO4 aqueous electrolytes, which is modified from ref. 23. 
Intermingling LiMn2O4 material with MWCNTs can also achieve some successes in improving the cycling stability of LiMn2O4 in the aqueous solutions. The discharge capacity of the hybrid of LiMn2O4 and MWCNTs is maintained at 112.8 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles. The capacity loss is only 3.59% while that of the virginal LiMn2O4 decreases to 50.1 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles.21 The smaller particle size and the larger surface area of the hybrid might reduce the Jahn–Teller effect during the charge/discharge process.
As for LiFePO4, it is demonstrated that both high OH− concentration and the dissolved O2 can accelerate its cycling fading which is due to not only to the chemical instability, but also the electrochemical instability. In the absence of dissolved O2, its cycling performance becomes deteriorated due to the increasing pH value. After 10 cycles, the retention of the peak current in an aqueous electrolyte of pH 13 is close to 5% of that for the initial cycle. The separation between redox peaks is reduced obviously as the ionic conductivity of the aqueous electrolyte increases. Accordingly, OH− is also involved in the side reactions parallel to the intercalation of Li+ ions and results in the capacity fading of LiFePO4. After LiFePO4 is coated with a carbon layer ,which could block the attack of the dissolved oxygen and OH− ions, the capacity fading is alleviated. These results fit very well with the application of LiFePO4 in organic electrolytes, since most prepared LiFePO4 is coated with a carbon layer.14,19,22,29
In the case of the other cathode materials, their cycling behaviors are poor,36,67–69 and further work is urgently needed to improve their cycling performance.
2 Anode materials
Vanadium oxides, molybdenum oxides and some lithium intercalation compounds have been illustrated as anode materials for ARLBs, whose performances are primarily summarized in Table 3. It is clear that research on anode materials is quite limited since it is more challenging.

2.1 Vanadium oxides
Dahn et al. first used VO2(B) as an anode material for ARLBs and its redox process is reversible since it has tunnels (4.984 Å × 3.281 Å) which are larger than Li+ ions. However, it suffers from loss of capacity (only around 17 cycles), which has been the key problem for a long time.3,4 Later, lots of researchers focused on the cycling life of VO2(B). Carbon coated VO2(B) microspheres exhibited a better cycling performance in an aqueous electrolyte compared to bare VO2(B), as determined from CV evaluation.84
Similar to the cathode materials, VO2(B) of special nanostructures such as nanorods, nanoflakes and nanoflowers have also been prepared via a one-step hydrothermal process.38 It is concluded that VO2(B) nanoflowers present the best cycling performance, though it is has only been evaluated from the CV curves without the galvanostatic cycling. The main reason for this is that nanoflowers have a robust and strong mechanical structure that can sustain wear and tear during the fabrication process of the electrode, as well as water soakage during the cycling process.
Montroseite VOOH and paramontroseite VO2 hollow nano-urchins exhibit an improved electrochemical performance with a relatively higher discharge capacity in the first cycle as the anode materials for ARLBs.34 A V2O5·nH2O xerogel displays improved Li+ ion intercalation kinetics in the saturated LiNO3 solution (Fig. 10a).85 At low or high scan rates, the redox peak separation is not much different. However, their cycling performance still needs more improvement. Its capacity fades by 11% after 100 cycles.85
 Fig. 10  (a) CV curves of the V2O5·nH2O xerogel in saturated LiNO3 aqueous solution and (b) charge and discharge curves of H2V3O8 nanowires in 5 M LiNO3 and 0.001 M LiOH aqueous solutions, which are modified from ref. 33 and 85, respectively. 
Single-crystal H2V3O8 nanowires provide a full intercalation reaction of Li+ ions prior to the hydrogen evolution, and delivers a much higher specific capacity (234 mA h g−1) than that of any other vanadium oxide candidate (45–110 mA h g−1) in aqueous electrolyte. It also presents a good rate capability (Fig. 10b).33 However, it suffers from obvious capacity fading during cycling, just like other vanadium oxides. The discharge capacity decreases from 212 to 153 mA h g−1 (only 72%) after 50 cycles.33
It is clear that nanomaterials are very useful for increasing the capacity of vanadium oxides and to improve their rate capabilities. However, the main problem associated with the capacity fading is the dissolution of the vanadium ions during the charge and discharge process. Recently, we introduced a conductive polypyrrole (PPy) coating layer on V2O5 nanoribbons. In order to achieve good rate capability, MWCNTs of good electronic conductivity was also introduced. The action mechanisms of the PPy coating and the MWCNTs are schematically shown in Scheme 1, and the electrochemical performance of the ARLBs is markedly improved, including the cycling life and rate capability.12

2.2 Molybdenum oxide
In the case of the commercial MoO3, there is only one couple of redox peaks at −0.72/−0.6 V (vs. SCE). As to the MoO3 nanoplates, whose morphology is shown in Fig. 11a, there are two couples of redox peaks at −0.39/−032 V and −0.75/−0.59 V (vs. SCE) in the CV curves, respectively. This suggests that nanostructuring improves the electrochemical activity of MoO3.8,86
 Fig. 11  (a) SEM micrograph of the virginal MoO3 nanoplates and (b) TEM micrograph of the PPy-coated MoO3 nanoplates, which are from ref. 11. 
As for metal oxides, the dissolution of the active cation will become worse when their electrochemical activity is increased through nanostructuring. So it is better to introduce a protection layer, such as a polymer coating, to guarantee the long cycling life. As for the nanocomposite of the PPy-coated MoO3 nanoplates, PPy@MoO3, the PPy coating can not only prevent or inhibit the dissolution of active Mo ions, but can also buffer the possible volume changes during the cycling process.11,12,87–90 At the same time, the PPy coating can partially act as a conductive binder to increase the contact between particles; therefore, the particle-to-particle resistance is decreased. In addition, anions such as SO42− exist at the surface of MoO3, Li+ ion transference or moving between the MoO3 host and the aqueous electrolytes could be favored since there will be enough Li+ ions in the PPy coating due to the absorption from the anions, which is illustrated in Scheme 2.11

2.3 Lithium intercalation compounds
LiV3O8 has been investigated as an anode material for ARLBs.5,91,92 For LiV3O8, the Li+ ion intercalation peak can be observed at −0.35 V and a de-intercalation peak at 0.1 V (vs. NHE).5 The lithium intercalation/de-intercalation processes for LiV3O8 is a combination of (a) electron injection at the host material/current collector interface, (b) diffusion of lithium ions in the solid lattice of the host material, (c) flip-flap of lithium ions across the host material/solution interface, and (d) lithium ion transport in the bulk of the aqueous solution. It is assumed that the ion transport in the bulk of the aqueous solution is fast enough and could not be the controlling step during the intercalation process.32,37 The kinetic parameters of the intercalation of Li+ ions in the aqueous electrolyte, including Rs (the ohmic resistance of the aqueous solution), Rct (the charge transfer resistance), Zw (the Warburg impedance), CDL (the capacitance of the double layer) and DLi+ (the diffusion coefficient of Li+ ions), vary with potential.92 When its nanorod is prepared by a sol–gel method,93 its rate capacity is greatly improved. In addition, when the PPy coating is introduced, its cycling behavior is also greatly ameliorated.94
A macaroni-like Li1.2V3O8 nanomaterial could deliver a higher capacity than LiV3O8, but exhibited worse cycling stability.39 LixV2O5 could be an anode for ARLBs. In an attempt to improve its cycling life, polyaniline (PANi) and PPy were coated on the surface of the LixV2O5 particles to achieve some improvement since the dissolution of V ions could be efficiently inhibited.95
LiTi2(PO4)3 belongs to the NASICON-type family in which lots of materials could be theoretically used as anodes for ARLBs. It delivers a reversible capacity of about 90 mA h g−1 with a Coulomb efficiency of 78% and 88% in the first and second cycles, respectively. The fading of the crystal structure and the formation of new compounds will reduce the lithium intercalation capacity.96 When nano-LiTi2(PO4)3 is coated by carbon from chemical vapor deposition, the reversible capacity (about 80 mA h g−1) and the rate capability in 1 M Li2SO4 are improved.97
2.4 Other available anode materials
Several spinels, such as Li2Mn4O9 and Li4Mn5O12, have been demonstrated as anode materials for ARLBs. The ARLBs deliver an average voltage of 1.1 V and a maximum capacity of 100 mA h g−1 (with respect to cathode active material).98 Alhough researchers do show much interest in these materials, they are still important potential anode materials for ARLBs.
3 Performance of ARLBs
Along with the exploration of their electrode materials, the electrochemical behaviors of the ARLBs have also been studied. The average output voltage of an ARLB consisting of a LiV3O8 anode and LiCoO2 cathode is approximately 1.05 V.5 When the carbon coated LiTi2(PO4)3 nanocomposite is used as the anode and LiMn2O4 as the cathode, its average output voltage can be increased to 1.5 V. However, its cycling performance is not satisfactory, with only 82% retention of the initial reversible capacity after 200 cycles.97
As mentioned above, the PPy coated oxides can greatly improve the stability in aqueous electrolytes during cycling.11,12 When they are combined together with LiMn2O4 as the cathode, as shown in Fig. 12, two ARLB systems are achieved. The working voltage of the ARLBs ranges between 0.8 and 1.75 V or 0.8 and 1.95 V based on the V2O5 or MoO3 composite, respectively. The specific capacity, related to the cathode mass is around 110 mA h g−1.8,11,12
 Fig. 12  Charge and discharge curves of some electrode materials and the ARLBs, which is a combination of the curves from ref. 11 and 12. 
The PPy coating provides not only good cycling performance but also excellent rate capability for the ARLBs. As shown in Fig.13a, the ARLB system consisting of the PPy coated V2O5 nanoribbons and the LiMn2O4 cathode shows no evident capacity (based on the weight of cathode) loss after 500 cycles, except some during the initial several cycles.12 At the same time, as shown in Fig.13b, the PPy coating could improve the rate capability of the ARLBs. Even at a power density of 6 kW kg−1, its energy density can be 38 W h kg−1. It means that the charging time will be less than 1 minute, which is usually the time required for filling with gasoline for engine cars. Their comparison of charging (filling) time is shown in Table 4. This kind of superfast charging performance can be compared with supercapacitors,11,12 which is very rare for the battery systems. From the viewpoint of charging time, it is very convenient. In contrast, without the PPy coating, the rate capability of the ARLB consisting of the virginal MoO3 is very poor.11

From the above work, it can be seen that ARLBs have the following characteristics:
• good availability of lithium salts, such as Li2SO4 and LiNO3
• high ionic conductivity, about 1–2 orders of magnitudes higher than those of the organic electrolyte, suitable for charging and discharging at a high rate
• high power density
• good safety, no combustibility or explosion since aqueous electrolytes are used
• easy to produce since there is no strict control on humidity
• low requirements on separators since glass fiber felts for lead acid batteries can be used for ARLBs
• low production cost
• friendly to the environment, completely green, which is different from lithium ion batteries having a serious pollution of HF acid to the environment due to the use of LiPF6 as the supporting salt that have never been recycled
• satisfactory energy density (40–90 W h kg−1) based on the both electrodes
• super-fast charge capability
• excellent cycling behavior
4 Conclusion and outlook
Among the cathode materials for ARLBs, LiMn2O4 is found to be a good candidate due to its low cost and good stability in aqueous electrolytes. When it is prepared at the nano-scale or modified by adding some additives such as MWCNTs, the rate capability and the cycling stability have been markedly improved. It can undergo more than 10000 cycles and can charge/discharge at high rates. As to the anode materials, great progress has been achieved in terms of reversible capacity, cycling and rate capability. These advances should mainly be ascribed to the nanostructuring and coating. The former can diminish the diffusion distance for Li+ ions and the latter can prevent the dissolution of the transitional elements, achieving structural stability. Consequently, the ARLB system can realize a superfast charging performance and excellent cycling life. They can be used as power sources for large-scale energy storage and hybrid electric vehicles, assisting power sources for electric vehicles and range-extenders.
There are a lot of crystal planes in the electrode materials. One or several facets of their crystals are able to make facile the charging or discharging process, since it has been well illustrated in solar cells and lithium ion batteries. The crystal orientation should be moderated by controlling the preparing conditions to realize much faster, perhaps second-level, redox reactions during the charge and discharge processes.99 Another direction is to prepare micro-/nano-structured materials or micrometer materials with excellent electrochemical performances, since nanomaterials are difficult to process.23
The key problem for ARLBs is the exploring of available anode materials with good stability in aqueous electrolytes. Cheap costs, environmental friendliness and fundamental safety are required. So far, the reported anode materials have advantages and disadvantages in accordance to the application in large-scale energy storage system.
Of course, some fundamental research is also urgently needed, for example, the intercalation mechanism, the effects of pH and temperature, and the possible decomposition of water, as they are very important and remain unknown.
Further direction is needed to expand the working voltage so that the energy density can be significantly increased. Table 5 compares the power densities and energy densities of several kinds of chemical power sources. The energy density of the ARLBs should be increased to qualify for further applications in electric vehicles, besides the smart grids, although it presents a power superiority to the other batteries. For example, metal foils such as Zn and Sn can be used as anode materials and lithium intercalation compounds as cathode materials,67–69,100 where these ARLBs can achieve an average discharge voltage above 1.5 V with a higher energy density. It is known that the decomposition of water is a limiting factor of ARLBs for achieving a high energy density. If a “potential cross-over” instead of the traditional polarization can be fully utilized, new ARLBs with a stable work voltage up to 4 V,101 a break-through of the stable electrochemical window of water (1.229 V), can be achieved. The new ARLBs will surely be promising for energy storage systems in electric vehicles since their energy density will be much higher than those for lithium ion batteries.

Table Content:
Yuping Wu	Dr Yuping Wu is a professor at Fudan University, Shanghai, China. Since 1994, he has published over 200 peer-reviewed papers, written five monographs, whose sales are above 23000 copies, and 3 chapters, translated one book, and has 20 issued patents. H-Index is 32. His research has led to the creation of three companies on anode materials, cathode materials and power lithium ion batteries, respectively. His research is mainly focused on lithium ion batteries, supercapacitors, other new energy storage and conversion systems and solar hydrogen.

Broader context
For large-scale energy storage systems, their safety and reliability are more challenging than those required for electric vehicles. New rechargeable batteries are urgently needed. It has been well realized that an aqueous electrolyte is one of the safest choices for rechargeable batteries. In addition, the ionic conductivity of aqueous electrolytes is higher than those of nonaqueous and solid electrolytes, which is one prerequisite for a fast redox reaction, i.e., fast charge and discharge processes. In the case of aqueous rechargeable lithium batteries (ARLBs), the first was invented in 1994. Only until recently has great progress been achieved. The main reasons are ascribed to the nanostructuring and surface coating on their electrode materials. The reversible capacities of their electrode materials are markedly increased, which can be similar to those achieved in organic electrolytes. Their cycling life is excellent. For example, in the case of LiMn2O4, its capacity retention can be 93% after 10000 full cycles. In addition, their electrode materials and the ARLBs can be charged at a super fast rate, which is comparable with gasoline filling for car engines. These progresses show that ARLBs provide another promising choice as a power source for smart grids and hybrid electric vehicles, and can assist the power sources of electric vehicles and range-extenders.
