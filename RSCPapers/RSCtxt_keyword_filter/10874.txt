    , Accepted 14th March 2023First published on 15th March 2023AbstractTo pursue the efficient photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), a series of passivators have been employed to cure the defects of perovskite. A feasible strategy for designing efficient passivators is enhancing strong passivation capacity for effectively coordinating with under-coordinated Pb2+ on the surface of the perovskite. In this work, the TA-MN passivator with a symmetric bidentate acceptor can achieve the synergistic passivating effect of two symmetric cyano groups (CN) and thus exhibited an excellent passivation ability over the single passivating effect of carboxyl (COOH) or CN group in TA-CA passivator with the asymmetric bidentate acceptor, which is attributed to the fact that the same electron-withdrawing ability can promote the same CN groups in symmetric bidentate acceptor obtain similar electron density and thus interact together with under-coordinated Pb2+ simultaneously. Moreover, a better band alignment with a hole-transporting layer (HTL) can be achieved by the perovskite films with a TA-MN passivator. These results promote TA-MN-based PSCs to obtain a higher PCE of 21.19% with VOC of 1.114 V, JSC of 24.60 mA cm−2 and fill factor (FF) of 77.37%, which is larger than that of TA-CA (20.54%) and control (19.49%). Furthermore, 1 cm2 scaling-up preparation and good stability of TA-MN-based PSCs were also further confirmed to be practical. This work provides a more effective design of passivators with symmetric bidentate acceptors for strong synergistic passivating ability.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have received widespread attention owing to their high absorption coefficient, long charge carrier diffusion length, and high mobility,1–4 especially, for the boosting power conversion efficiency (PCE) of its solar cells from 3.8% to a recently certified record of 25.7% in the past decade.5,6 Benefiting from the advantages of low-cost and easy fabrication, solution-process fabrication is the standard method for preparing the perovskite layer. However, defects originating from a rapid growth crystalline and heat treatment in solution-process fabrication often act as the charge carrier recombination center or the infiltration pathways for water vapor, which seriously weakens the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), including the PCE and stability.7–10 To break the bottleneck for high-performance PSCs, a series of available strategies have been developed to passivate the defects at grain boundaries and surface, including Lewis acid/base, halide salts, quantum dots, metal–organic frameworks, ionic liquids, etc.11–16 These passivating materials often utilize their functional groups, such as amino (NH2), carboxyl (COOH), nitro (NO2) and cyano (CN) to incorporate with under-coordinated Pb2+ defects at the surface of perovskite via chemical passivation strategy.17–23
Compared with a single functional group, multiple functional groups are preferable to be introduced into organic molecules acting as the passivators due to their synergetic passivation, beneficial for achieving high-performance PSCs. For example, Li et al. introduced a DTA molecule containing bilateral carboxyl groups into perovskite film. The high electron density of symmetric carboxyl groups on both sides of DTA can effectively passivate the defects in the perovskite by interacting with unsaturated Pb2+.24 Besides, the bidentate passivators, owning two functional groups at the same carbon atom, also have aroused widespread attention owing to their strong passivation ability. For example, compared to the monodentate passivation effect of pyridine and p-toluenethiol, 2-mercaptopyridine exhibited improved binding strength and adhesion of the passivation layer on perovskite surface by bidentate coordination, which remarkably improved photovoltaic performance of perovskite.25 Wang et al. introduced organic cyano-based π-conjugated molecules to passivate perovskite, and compared to SM1 with single cyano, the SM2 with dual-cyano functional groups exhibited stronger interaction with the undercoordinated Pb2+.26 On the other hand, the organic dye with a cyanoacrylate functional group was recently verified to be another efficient passivator. Han et al. demonstrated that the PSCs passivated by AQ310 dye have a reduced density of defects, prolonged carrier lifetime, and enhanced VOC and PCE.27 Similarly, our previous work also verified that the D–A–π–A molecules have an excellent capacity for passivating the under-coordinated Pb2+ defects because a more planar π-bridge of MM-4 promoted the electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor and the enriched electrons of acceptor enhanced the effect of defect passivation.28
To obtain the efficacious passivation for PSCs, two distinct functional groups (COOH and CN) were introduced into the donor–acceptor (D–A) structure to design new bidentate passivators, including TA-CA with asymmetric bidentate acceptor of two different functional groups of CN and COOH, and TA-MN with symmetric bidentate acceptor of two similar functional CN groups. A combined theoretical and experimental study found that TA-CA, with more significant adsorption energy of COOH and higher electron density of CN than that of the dual-CN group in TA-MN, achieves poorer passivation and more defects density in perovskite than that of TA-MN. This promotes a reasonable deduction that the synergistic passivating effect of two CN groups in TA-MN molecule facilitates better passivation ability overweighing the single passivating effect of COOH or CN group in TA-CA molecule, which should be attributed to that the same electron-withdrawing ability equalizes the electron density and thus two CN groups in TA-MN molecule can incorporate together with the under-coordinated Pb2+ in perovskite film (Fig. 1a). Moreover, it is worth noting that the perovskite film with TA-MN passivator can form a better band alignment with a hole-transporting layer (HTL). Therefore, a champion PCE of 21.19% with VOC of 1.114 V, JSC of 24.60 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) of 77.37% was achieved by TA-MN-based PSCs, higher than that of TA-CA (20.54%) and control (19.49%), which further facilitate 1 cm2 scaling-up device with a PCE of 18.52%. Doubtlessly, the TA-MN-based device without and with encapsulation also exhibits good stability owing to its good defect passivation.

2. Results and discussion
The synthetic procedure of two bidentate molecules is shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† The precursor, 4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)benzaldehyde, was synthesized according to previous reports and then was reacted with 2-cyanoacetic acid or malononitrile via Knoevenagel reaction to produce the target molecules (TA-CA and TA-MN, respectively).29,30 The molecular structures were confirmed by 1H-NMR (Fig. S2 and S3†), 13C-NMR spectra (Fig. S4 and S5†), and mass spectrometry (MS) (Fig. S6 and S7†). As shown in Fig. 1b, the results of X-ray single-crystallographic diffraction further exhibited the typical D–A structure with the bidentate functional groups at the same carbon atom (Table S1†). Moreover, two bidentate molecules exhibited a planar structure, promoting the charge transport from the donor to the acceptor. To explore the charge density distribution of the changed acceptor unit in different bidentate molecules, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out. As shown in Fig. 1c, high electron density significantly emerged on the acceptor units of two bidentate molecules (cyanoacetic acid or dicyano group), which might confer them the passivation ability via the interaction with under-coordinated Pb2+ cation on perovskite surface.31,32 However, as for the asymmetric acceptor of TA-CA, its CN group owns much higher electron density than its COOH group and even higher than that of two CN groups in TA-MN, which may be ascribed to be that the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of CN group than that of COOH group impels the electron transfer from the triphenylamine donor and COOH group to CN group and thus COOH group to possess lower electron density. Conversely, the same and strong electron-withdrawing ability of both CN groups in TA-MN makes them bear equally high electron density, which brings TA-MN a stronger dipole moment (12.03 Debye) of the TA-MN molecule than that of TA-CA (10.01 Debye). These results indicated that two bidentate molecules could act as passivators to improve the performance of PSCs, especially for TA-CA with a higher electron density of CN and stronger adsorbability of the COOH group than that of TA-MN with the dual-CN group.28,33
To verify the interaction between two bidentate molecules and perovskite, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to detect the states of surface elements in perovskite films without and with the passivation of bidentate molecules. As shown in Fig. 2a, the Pb 4f5/2 and Pb 4f7/2 signals for the control film are mainly located at 143.17 eV and 138.30 eV, respectively. For bidentate molecule passivated perovskite films, the binding energy of Pb 4f shifted to lower energy, and the peaks of Pb 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 shifted to 143.09 eV and 138.19 eV for TA-CA, and 142.91 eV and 138.05 eV for TA-MN, respectively, suggesting that the combination of bidentate molecules with Pb2+ will enhance the electron density around Pb2+via the combination of lone electron pairs and empty orbitals.34 Moreover, the shifted XPS signals of CO or CN were also observed (Fig. 2b and c), confirming that the terminal groups of bidentate molecules could interact with under-coordinated Pb2+ defects. Strangely, the larger shifts of binding energy for Pb 4f and N 1s occur in perovskite film passivated by TA-MN and indicate a better passivation capacity of TA-MN than that of TA-CA,32,35 which is worth a profound investigation. In addition, the Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) of D–A molecules with and without PbI2 were performed (Fig. 2d, e and S8a, b†). It was found that the stretching vibration of the CO bond for TA-CA exhibited a red shift from 1675.1 to 1672.4 cm−1 after being mixed with PbI2. Likewise, the stretching vibration of the CN bond for TA-CA and TA-MN also shifted to the lower wavenumbers of 2213.5 and 2216.7 cm−1 from 2214.7 and 2219.1 cm−1, respectively. These results also confirmed the interaction of the CO or CN groups in two bidentate molecules with PbI2.26,36 An interesting phenomenon is that two same CN groups in TA-MN presented only a stretching peak at 2216.7 cm−1 after the coordination of TA-MN with PbI2, which might result from the synergistic coordination of CN groups.37 Besides the decreased XRD intensity of PbI2 films, the changed color of PbI2 films from yellow to orange and the red-shift of corresponding UV–vis spectra of the mixed solution of bidentate molecules with PbI2 further verified the interaction between bidentate molecules and PbI2 (Fig. S8 and S9†).38,39

To further evaluate the effects of bidentate molecules on the crystalline structure of perovskite, two bidentate molecules were introduced into the perovskite films as the passivators via an anti-solvent process. As shown in Fig. 2f, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite films were performed. All of the perovskite films presented similar diffraction peaks, which were assigned to the typical α-phase. However, the intensities of the PbI2 peak at 12.6° slightly decreased. The perovskite peak at 14° was enhanced after the perovskite films were passivated by bidentate molecules, indicating that the bidentate molecules could diminish the Pb2+ defects and suppress the formation of PbI2.40 From the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. S10a–c and g–i†), the reduced PbI2 and the slightly enlarged grain sizes of perovskite was observed after the bidentate molecules were introduced into perovskite. Moreover, in the cross-section SEM images (Fig. S10d–f†), the perovskite layers with or without bidentate molecules have a similar thickness (about 850 nm), and fewer grain boundaries were also observed for the films passivated by bidentate molecules, possibly due to the cross-linking effect of bidentate molecules with the dual-functional group at the terminal.41 Therefore, the fewer grain boundaries under the passivation of bidentate molecules may decrease the recombination of carriers. Furthermore, atomic force microscope (AFM) (Fig. S11†) images illustrated that the perovskite films with bidentate molecules have a smaller surface roughness, meaning the smoother films, which could enhance the contact between the perovskite layer and HTL and thus facilitate carrier transport.42 To evaluate the effect of bidentate molecules on passivating defects, the space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement based on both hole- and electron-only devices was carried out by the dark current–voltage (I–V) curves. From Fig. 2g–i, the onset voltage values for the trap-filled limited region (VTFL) of electron-only devices for the control, TA-CA, and TA-MN were 1.08, 0.814, and 0.623 V, respectively. According to formula (1), the trap density (Ntrap) of the devices with TA-CA and TA-MN was calculated to be 9.74 × 1015 cm−3 and 7.45 × 1015 cm−3 respectively, which were less than 1.29 × 1016 cm−3 of the control.18,43 Ntrap = 2εrε0VTFL/(qL2)(1)
Synchronously, the hole-only devices with TA-CA and TA-MN also showed obviously decreased Ntrap values (1.07 × 1015 for TA-CA and 8.35 × 1014 cm−3 for TA-MN), which were also less than that of the control (1.30 × 1015 cm−3) (Fig. S12†). The reduction of Ntrap indicated that the trap densities in perovskite films could be suppressed successfully due to the passivation by bidentate molecules. However, an aberration that the devices based on TA-MN exhibited obviously less Ntrap than that of TA-CA has aroused our attention.
Inexplicably, the theoretical ESP results illustrate the higher electron density at the CN group of TA-CA than that of the two CN groups of TA-MN. Also, a series of previous literature studies have reported that the COOH group with strong adsorbability can achieve better passivation than the CN group.44,45 In principle, the bidentate TA-CA should have a stronger interaction with Pb2+ and reduced defects conspicuously. Dramatically, the experimental results indicated that TA-MN exhibited a strong passivation effect over TA-CA. Therefore, a reasonable deduction is that the two CN groups in TA-MN can interact jointly with the Pb2+ ion, while TA-CA can only interact with either COOH or CN group, which has been put forward. This explains the odd phenomenon that FTIR spectra only present a stretching peak of the CN group in TA-MN. As for single functional-group passivation of TA-CA, shown in the results of ESP, it may be attributed to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the CN group reducing the electron density of the COOH group or forming intramolecular hydrogen bond between the CN group and COOH group, thereby weakening the adsorbability of COOH groups.32,46 Instead, two same CN groups in TA-MN facilitate similarly strong electron density, as shown in Fig. 1b, enabling them to achieve synergistic passivation for fewer defects, in accord with the XPS results and indicating better passivation capacity of TA-MN.47
Systematic research on recombination mechanisms was carried out to further validate the synergistic passivating effect of TA-MN. As shown in Fig. 3a–d, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectrum and corresponding PL mapping images of perovskite films without and with the passivators have been characterized. It can be observed that the intensities of PL peaks around 790 nm were increased after the passivation of TA-CA or TA-MN, and the more uniform PL mapping image with the stronger intensity was obtained by the film based on TA-MN, revealing that less nonradiative recombination originated from efficient passivation.48 Meanwhile, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) was adopted to explore the carrier dynamics, and the PL decay curves were fitted with a bi-exponential decay function (Fig. 3e and Table S2†). The average lifetime (τ) of perovskite films was prolonged from 696.8 ns (control) to 932.0 ns for TA-CA and 1172.1 ns for TA-MN, suggesting that TA-MN decreased the trap-assisted recombination significantly due to the better cooperation with under-coordinated Pb2+ defects. Moreover, the devices can work as the LEDs under 1.5 V bias, as shown in Fig. S13.† Obviously, the electroluminescence (EL) peaks can be observed at around 787 nm, and the TA-MN-based device exhibited a higher EL intensity, which indicated the reduced VOC loss resulting from lower nonradiative recombination, further demonstrating that TA-MN can reduce the defect density and suppress trap-assisted recombination more effectively.49 These results illustrate that TA-MN indeed owns better passivating ability and thus achieves suppressed trap-assisted recombination more effectively, which can indirectly verify the synergistic passivating effect of the TA-MN molecule.18,50 The dependency of VOC and JSC on the light intensity was investigated to gain deeper insight into the carrier recombination mechanisms of PSCs.51 According to JSC = Iα, the JSC alters as a function of the light intensity in Fig. 3f, and the α value is approximated to 1, reflecting the smaller bimolecular recombination loss in PSCs. Compared to the α value (0.976) of the control device, the α values of TA-CA and TA-MN-based devices were increased to 0.978 and 0.988, respectively, suggesting their slight enhancement of charge transport and suppressed carrier recombination, especially for the device with TA-MN.52 Moreover, Fig. 3g also showed the plots of the light intensity versus the VOC, and the slope was deviated to kT/q, suggesting trap-assisted recombination in PSCs. Compared with the slope of 1.94 kT/q for the control device, the TA-CA and TA-MN passivated devices exhibited reduced slopes of 1.71 kT/q and 1.54 kT/q, respectively, indicating that the defect-assisted charge recombination was significantly diminished, especially for the device based on TA-MN.53 Besides, the leakage current (J0) induced by carrier recombination in PSCs was investigated by dark J–V measurements. As shown in Fig. 3h, the PSCs with TA-MN presented a J0 of 3.98 × 10−7 mA cm−2, which was lower than that of the control device (2.05 × 10−6 mA cm−2) and TA-CA-based device (8.82 × 10−7 mA cm−2), further confirming more efficient passivation of defects and suppressed recombination of carriers.31,54 Furthermore, the interfacial carrier transfer process and recombination behavior in the PSCs were also explored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Fig. 3i exhibits the Nyquist plots of PSCs without or with bidentate passivators at a bias potential under dark conditions, and the fitted data are listed in Table S3.† The recombination resistance (Rrec) of the device based on TA-MN was measured to be 5722 Ω, far overweighing 2918 Ω of the control device and 4068 Ω of the device with TA-CA, indicating that the carrier recombination was suppressed, which might be attributed to the efficient passivation of defects.55

To evaluate the effects of bidentate molecule passivation on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, the n–i–p type PSCs (FTO/c-TiO2/m-TiO2/perovskite (with or without bidentate passivators)/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au) were fabricated (Fig. 4a). By optimization, the best devices were prepared by using 0.01 mg mL−1 of bidentate passivators (Fig. S14–S17, Tables S4 and S5†). The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 4b, and the detailed performance parameters are listed in Table 1. As expected, the devices passivated with TA-MN achieved the champion PCE of 21.19% with JSC of 24.60 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.114 V, and FF of 77.37%, obviously higher than those of the control one (19.49%) and TA-CA (20.54%), which verified that the synergistic passivation improved the cell performance. The different PCEs should originate from the enhanced VOC, ascribing to the joint passivation efforts of TA-MN for under-coordinated Pb2+ defects and, thus, suppress the nonradiative recombination of carriers and diminish the loss of energy more effectively.19,56 Moreover, the statistical photovoltaic performance of 30 devices without and with bidentate passivators was also collected, as shown in Fig. 4c and S18,† demonstrating excellent reproducibility. The PSCs based on TA-MN obtain the best average efficiency of 20.47%, higher than that of the control device (18.83%) and the TA-CA (19.47%), which is in agreement with the results of the J–V curves. Besides, the TA-MN passivator exhibited a good passivation ability on different types of perovskites and similarly improved the photovoltaic performance (Fig. S19 and Table S6†), demonstrating the application potential of TA-MN molecule.

Undoubtedly, the reliability of the devices is also of significant importance for PSCs. As shown in Fig. 4d, the devices without or with bidentate passivators showed similar incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and integrated JSC values, which approached the JSC obtained from corresponding J–V curves, indicating that the bidentate passivators have a negligible effect on the light absorption of perovskite films.57 The steady-state photocurrent density and PCE of the PSCs without and with bidentate passivators were measured under an applied bias at the maximum power point for 300 s. As shown in Fig. 4e, the PSCs based on the control, TA-CA, and TA-MN, achieved reliable and stable JSC and PCEs of 22.29 mA cm−2 and 19.13% for the control cell, 22.44 mA cm−2 and 20.16% for TA-CA, and 22.18 mA cm−2 and 20.81% for TA-MN, respectively, which were in good agreement with the results of J–V measurements. In Fig. S20 and Table S7,† the hysteresis of PSCs was assessed by the J–V curves at forward and reverse scans. The TA-MN-based device obtained a lower hysteresis index (HI) of 10.9%, which was less than that of the control (31.6%) and TA-CA (21.0%), further confirming that the TA-MN passivator has a significant effect on the reduction of defect density and inhibition of the ionic migration.58 Benefiting from the excellent passivation of TA-MN, the 1 cm2 active area of PSCs with TA-MN also achieved a PCE of 18.52%, with a JSC of 24.47 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.126 V, and FF of 67.18%, higher than the control device (16.76%) and TA-CA-based PSCs (17.62%), confirming the practicability of TA-MN passivator (Fig. 4f).
In addition, the carrier transfer is also significant for the performance of PSCs, which is related to energy-level alignment between the perovskite and charge transport layers. From the results of the ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer (UPS) exhibited in Fig. 4h, the values of valence band maximum (VBM) of perovskite films passivated by bidentate passivators were elevated from −6.18 eV (control) to −5.81 eV (TA-CA) and −5.61 eV (TA-MN), resulting in a preferred energy level alignment between perovskite and HTL, which will facilitate the carrier transfer from perovskite to HTL. According to the Tauc plots of corresponding perovskite films in the absorption spectra (Fig. S21†), the bandgap energy (Eg) was determined to be approximately 1.59 eV. Therefore, the calculated energy level alignments of corresponding functional layers are illustrated in Fig. 4g. The upshifted VBM further confirmed the interactions between bidentate passivators and perovskite, which changed the electronic state of the perovskite surface for generating the band bending with dipoles.34,59–61 The Mott–Schottky (M–S) analysis was also measured to investigate the built-in potentials (Vbi) of PSCs. As shown in Fig. 4i, the Vbi can be calculated from the intercepts of the linear region of the M–S plot with the X-axis. The calculated Vbi was enhanced from 0.836 V for control to 0.884 V for TA-CA and 0.951 V for TA-MN.38,62 The increased Vbi of TA-MN was more beneficial to carrier extraction and transport, possibly due to the reduced defects on the perovskite surface and the favorable electronic structure at the interface of the perovskite/HTL induced by the significant dipole moment of TA-MN.31,63 Moreover, the PL and TR-PL measurements based on the perovskite/HTL were further investigated (Fig. S22a–c, Table S8†). Compared to the control film, the perovskite film passivated by bidentate passivators showed a stronger quench of PL intensity and shorter PL lifetime, suggesting faster carrier extraction and transport between perovskite and HTL, especially for the sample with TA-MN. This was consistent with the results of PL mapping images based on the perovskite/HTL films (Fig. S22d and e†), and the sample with TA-MN also obtained a more uniform image with a lower PL intensity.
Given the excellent passivation and performance of PSCs with bidentate passivators, we further focused on the stability to prove the potential of the passivators in practical application. As displayed in Fig. 5a, the perovskite films with bidentate passivators achieved about 64° of the contact angles, which was higher than that of control one, indicating the better humidity stability of perovskite films treated by bidentate passivators owing to the enhanced hydrophobicity.26,64 Therefore, the perovskite film with bidentate passivators can remain black with little change under exposure in highly humid conditions (80–90% RH) for 10 days (Fig. 5b), while the control one faded to yellow. Moreover, XRD patterns were also performed for the perovskite films aged at 10–20% RH for 60 days (Fig. 5c). It was observed that the content of PbI2 in the control film was increased, and the crystallinity of perovskite was decreased, but the perovskite films passivated by TA-CA or TA-MN did not exhibit noticeable change, indicating that the decomposition of perovskite was suppressed after passivating.65 Moreover, the long-term stability of unencapsulated PSCs was further monitored, and the results are shown in Fig. 5d and e. The devices passivated by TA-MN and TA-CA, aged in a dry box with 10–20% RH, retained about 80.7% and 74.9% of their initial PCE after 70 days, but the control device was dropped to 56.6% of its initial PCE. In addition, the devices passivated by TA-MN or TA-CA retained 74.2% and 76.7% of initial PCE after exposing them to ambient air with 50–60% RH for 20 days, which was higher than that of the control device under the same condition. These results verified that the improved stability for the devices passivated by TA-MN might be ascribed to the fact that the reduced defects can protect perovskite from the decomposition induced by water vapor penetration.7,66

3. Conclusions
In summary, two bidentate molecules were synthesized and introduced into perovskite films as the passivators. Different from the TA-CA passivator with a single passivating effect of COOH or CN group, the TA-MN passivator can achieve synergetic passivating effects of two same CN groups for efficient PSCs due to similarly high electron density resulting from the same electron-withdrawing functional group, which resulted in that the TA-MN molecule exhibited better passivation effect for eliminating Pb2+ defects and thus suppressed the energy loss that arose from trap-assisted recombination. Especially TA-MN molecule can also adjust the surface energy level of perovskite to match well with HTM, promoting carrier extraction and transport. As a result, the device passivated by TA-MN achieved outstanding photovoltaic performance with a PCE of 21.19%, higher than that of TA-CA (20.56%), which resulted from the apparent improvement of VOC. Furthermore, due to the better passivating ability, 1 cm2 scaling-up preparation and good stability of TA-MN-based devices were confirmed to be feasible. Consequently, such work provides new insight into designing passivating molecules with symmetric bidentate acceptors for synergistic passivation.
