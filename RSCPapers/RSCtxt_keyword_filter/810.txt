    , Accepted 17th March 2022First published on 17th March 2022AbstractThe pivotal impact of organic cation rotation may result in structural complexity in two-dimensional (2D) halide-based hybrid perovskites. The crucial role of the orientation of the organic cation (MA = CH3NH3+) in the 2D Ruddlesden–Popper phase (2DRP) is explored using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our results propose that the MA cation rotation imposes the structural distortion in the PbI6 network, which is further responsible for the changes in nature and value of the electronic bandgap, charge density and optical absorption. The spin–orbit coupling effect results in a wide range of Rashba splitting parameters being obtained from 0.04 to 0.278 eV Å. The simulated optical absorption spectra suggest that absorption edge for the alignment of the MA molecule along the X-axis (having unidirectional hydrogen bonds) is higher than that of the alignment of the MA cation in the z-direction. Furthermore, the unidirectional hydrogen bonds between the MA cation and Pb–I framework significantly help to achieve the highest mobility of charge carriers up to ∼1437 cm2 V−1 s−1. Such high mobility leads to supremacy in the thermoelectric transport properties, which are investigated for the first time with the rotation of the MA cation. The calculated thermoelectric power factor at room temperature shows exceptionally high values (up to 2.04 mW m−1 K−2), leading to desired applications in thermoelectric devices. The rotation of the MA cation might be utilized as a useful tool for variation in optical absorption and transport coefficients. Therefore, our results spark the idea to develop 2D perovskites for real-time perspective in solar and heat energy utilization.
1. Introduction
Besides the excellent photovoltaic applications, perovskite materials received significant recognition in photodetectors,1 spintronics,2 and light-emitting diodes.3 In a very short period, the power conversion efficiency of three-dimensional (3D) CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite material-based solar cells advanced from 3.4% to 22%, attributed to peculiar characteristics such as a small effective mass of charge carriers, long diffusion length and ambipolar carrier motilities.4 Meanwhile hybrid organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials have gathered significant attention from the materials science research community due to their effective light absorption capabilities and charge carrier lifetimes.5–7 The halide-based perovskites exhibit ultra-low thermal conductivity which might hold their prominent applications in thermoelectric devices.8 He et al. reported that the range of thermoelectric figures of merit varies from 1 to 2, which further depends on the ionic conductivity.9 Recent work by Haque et al. on the thermoelectric properties of the hybrid halide perovskite reported the ultra-low thermal conductivity of ∼0.32 W m−1 K−1 and depicts that the Pb–I framework of CH3NH3PbI3 plays a vital role in thermal transport at room temperature.10 Liu et al. experimentally investigated the thermoelectric properties of the CsSnI3 perovskite thin film and depicted that chlorine doping leads to the improvement of stability as well as releasing the free charge carriers at the surface.11 Despite the ultralow thermal conductivity achieved for 3D halide perovskites, the performance of this material toward thermoelectric applications is in the early stages and a new strategy is required with fine-tuning of the electronic and transport properties. The bandgap of perovskite materials, which is the responsible parameter for such a wide range of applications might be regulated in the whole spectrum of visible light by using different halide anions (Cl−, Br− and I−).12–14 The explicit mixing of halide anions in hybrid perovskite materials leads to exceptional and suitable band gaps, with sharp edges.15,16
Despite vigorous development in the electronic structure and power conversion efficiency, 3D halide-based hybrid perovskites encounter several stability issues such as moisture, heat and oxygen-induced instabilities in real-time device performance.17 However, two-dimensional (2D) perovskite materials manifest excellent structural stability under ambient conditions.18,19 The 2D Ruddlesden–Popper (2DRP) phase of perovskites is prominent for optoelectronic functionality, comprised of large organic cations (R-NH3+), which splits the layers of the inorganic Pb–I network. The experimental investigation on the layered 2DRP phase of perovskites ((BA)2(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1; where BA = CH3(CH2)3NH3 and n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ∞)) by Stoumpos et al. suggests that these materials with a higher number of n can be a promising candidate for the light absorber in solar cells due to the bandgap range and the excellent environmental stability.20 Recently, Ren et al. reported the highest efficiency of 18.06% for bulky 2-(methylthio)ethylamine (MTEA) cation-based 2D (MTEA)2(CH3NH3)4Pb5I16 perovskites among the considered 2DRP structures.21 The presence of sulfur–sulfur interaction between two MTEA cations is responsible for the boost in the changer transport and stability.21 Furthermore, the quantum confinement effect and variation in dielectric properties of organic cations give rise to the stability of excitons in low dimensional hybrid perovskite materials.22 The complex structure of hybrid perovskites leads to prominent interionic interactions and softness in the structure, which unfold many novel properties by the motion of organic cations.7 However, the structural phase transition in 3D CH3NH3PbI3 is strongly coupled with the dipole–dipole interactions between organic cations, hydrogen bond interaction between the organic and inorganic part and the rotation of organic cations.23 Below the structural phase transition temperature in 3D CH3NH3PbI3, the mobility and lifetime of carriers increases and determine that sudden changes were attributed to the freezing of organic cations at low temperature.24 Furthermore, Motta et al. reported that 3D MAPbI3 shows direct to indirect bandgap transitions by changing the orientation of the MA cation from the (111) to (011) crystallographic direction.25 The molecular dynamics simulation on the 3D perovskite at a temperature of 319 K reveals that the MA cation also influences the position of VBM, which results in the variation in the electronic bandgap.26 Furthermore, a similar output has also been reported by Ali et al., using density functional theory that the MA cation rotation varies the electronic bandgap from 1.49 to 1.80 eV.27 For the case of the 2D RP phase of perovskites, the molecular dynamics simulation study depicts an increase in the rigidness of the inorganic framework with the number of Pb–I layers.28 Moreover, Maheshwari et al. investigated the role of dipole direction of the organic cation on the electronic properties using ab initio calculations and demonstrated the impact of local electrostatic potential generated between the organic and inorganic part of the perovskites.29 Furthermore, the effective mass of charge carriers reveals the significant variation with the alignment of the dipoles, which leads to modification in mobility.29 Moreover, temperature-dependent phase transitions and organic spacers have an enormous impact on the distortion of the Pb–I network of 2D perovskites, which further significantly tune the carrier effective mass.30,31 Furthermore, Du et al. observed that the exciton properties of 2D perovskites are affected more by Pb–I layer distortion, rather than the octahedral geometry.32 Using hybrid density functional theory (DFT) Amanda et al. reported that the charged states localized in CH3NH3PbI3 are distinctly associated with the volumetric strain and the reorientation of the CH3NH3+ cation.33 Moreover, a reduction in charge carrier recombination is acquired through the re-orientation of the organic cation in hybrid organic–inorganic perovskites.34–36
The complex and diverse structure of 2DRP perovskites gives rise to Rashba splitting due to the strong spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effects and breaking of the inversion symmetry.37–41 In our previous work, two structures of 2D halide-based hybrid perovskites (i) layered (BA)2(CH3NH3) Pb2I7 (M1) and (ii) 2D derivative of 3D CH3NH3PbI3 (M2) was investigated using DFT calculations along with the SOC effects, where the significantly large value of Rashba splitting energy was obtained.41 Moreover, Motta et al. suggested that the organic cation rotation plays an important role in the electronic and optical properties of bulk CH3NH3PbI3.25 However, the orientation of organic cation (MA = CH3NH3+) in the 2DRP phase of perovskite is still unexplored and needs to be revealed as it significantly roots the hydrogen bond interactions between organic and inorganic parts of the structure. The impact of the orientation of the organic cation on thermoelectric transport properties is needed to unlock the high-performance heat to electrical energy conversion. Therefore, the present work is focused on establishing the aspects of inorganic/organic cation interactions and their impact on electronic, optical and transport properties. We report here the investigation based on state-of-the-art density functional theory (DFT) calculations along with the spin–orbit interaction effects on 2D halide-based hybrid perovskite materials.
2. Methodology
First-principles-based DFT calculations were used to perform the relaxation of geometries in the Quantum Espresso code.42 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used for the exchange and correlation functional proposed by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE). The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) method has been utilized to obtain the ground state of the considered rotation of organic cations.43 The plane waves were expanded up to 100 Ry and Brillouin zone were sampled using the 8 × 1 × 8 Monkhorst–Pack grid. The full-relativistic and norm-conserving Vanderbilt pseudopotential were utilized for the calculation of ground-state energy.44 Furthermore, the Kohn–Sham equation was solved iteratively to obtain the electronic minimization with the total energy conversion criteria of 10−8 Ry. Moreover, ionic minimization was achieved at the energy convergence of 10−4 Ry and the differences in forces are converged to 10−3 eV Å−1. The Grime's DFT-D2 van der Waals functional were accounted for the total energy of the system to consider the short-range interactions.45 The obtained electronic eigenvalues at each k-points have been utilized to calculate thermoelectric transport coefficients such as Seebeck coefficients, electrical conductivity and thermoelectric power factor (see the ESI† for the expressions used for the calculation). The electronic Boltzmann transport equation has been solved using the Boltztrap code, which uses the constant relaxation time approximations.46 Therefore, the solution of BTE gives rise to the electrical conductivity in terms of relaxation time, which we have calculated separately using the deformation potential theory by calculating the mobility of charge carriers. The Kramer–Kronig formalism is used to obtain the real part of the dielectric function (ε1), while the frequency-dependent imaginary part of the dielectric constants (ε2) is obtained from the occupied and unoccupied states momentum matrix within the Brillouin zone selection rules.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural analysis
The structure of the 2DRP phase consisting two BA cations located above and below the Pb–I framework, while one cation CH3NH3+ (MA cation) is positioned between the Pb–I layers. There has been a debate in the ground state configuration of the CH3NH3+ cation in hybrid perovskite materials. Therefore, the rotation of the CH3NH3+ cation is considered in order to understand the impact on the electronic, optical and thermoelectric properties of the 2DRP phase. We investigated two sets of rotation of the MA cation in the 2DRP phase, which is categorized by the in-plane axial rotation along the a- and c-directions and random rotation from the minimum configuration of the MA cation in the 2DPR phase of the perovskite. In the first set of rotation, the MA cation aligned within the ac plane of the crystal structure, with the angle of θ = 0°, 90°, 180° and 270° (angles calculated from x-direction of crystal structure) having the [100], [001], [00] and [00] crystallographic directions. In another set of rotations, we considered five random rotations of MA cation where the angle of θ is 29.98°, 78.03°, 134.40°, 178.98° and 236.50°, calculated from its ground state position in the 2DRP structure.41Fig. 1 presents the relaxed geometries of the considered 2DRP phase of perovskites along with the hydrogen bond length between the inorganic and organic parts of the 2D hybrid perovskite. In the present work, the first set of rotation is determined by A1, A2, A3 and A4, corresponding to the rotation with the angle of θ = 0°, 90°, 180° and 270°, respectively, while another set of rotation is symbolized as R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 for 29.98°, 78.03°, 134.40°, 178.98° and 236.50°, respectively. For each rotational configuration, the MA cation is held fixed, while other atoms in the structure are allowed to relax. The atomic positions other than the MA cation are relaxed to minimum energy. The obtained minimum energy of each rotation of the MA cation in the considered 2D perovskite is further utilized for relative energy analysis. Table 1 summarizes the structural parameters and relative energies for the considered rotations in the 2DRP structure. We begin our analysis with the relative stability from the total energy of each studied structure. From Table 1, it can be seen that the A1 structure is the most stable one among the considered sets of rotation. The rest of the structures have a difference of total energy (ΔE) within 0.1–0.9 eV per unit cell from the A1 structure. The present 2DRP perovskite consists of two layers of PbI6 octahedral geometry, which are connected through one common iodine atom (denoted as IM), as shown in Fig. 1. The bonds in PbI6 geometry are not aligned along with the crystallographic directions, which might be responsible for the non-centrosymmetric geometry.

It is noteworthy that the MA cation rotation causes the structural variation in both upper and lower PbI6 geometry, which can be visualized in Fig. 1. The optimized structures of A1 to A4 and R1 to R3 depict the slight tilting of the upper layer of PbI6 geometry towards the opposite of the a-direction, while the structures R4 and R5 depict the tilting of the Pb–I network along the a-directions of the structure. Moreover, MA cation rotation in the 2DRP phase of the perovskite leads to the significant movement of IM, which might aggregate the remarkable structural distortion in the lower PbI6 network. The movement of IM is determined as the angle of Pb–IM–Pb, which is tabulated in Table 1. It is a worthy observation that the bond angle of Pb–IM–Pb and Pb–IL–Pb for the A1 structure is closer to the 180° of the perfect octahedral structure of the PbI6 network than others. This suggests the close symmetric geometry of the Pb–I network of A1 and leads to a more stable structure than other considered structures. Furthermore, the R5 structure exhibits the lowest angle of 132.70° and 143.23° of Pb–IM–Pb and Pb–IL–Pb, which may cause the least stability among the considered structures. Moreover, from the ground state structure, the average bond length between Pb and I in the octahedral network of A1–A4 and R3–R5 structures show a slight increment, while R1 and R2 oriented structures depict the reduction in the same bond length. The maximum bond length alteration is observed for the A1 structure (∼0.05 Å), where alignment of the MA cation is along the a-direction of the structure. Additionally, the distance between Pb of the lower layer and the IM varies in the range of 3.30 to 3.86 Å. Such bond length is maximized for the A2 structure, while it is minimum for the A1 structure among the considered orientation of the MA cation. We have also determined the interlayer distance in the Pb–I octahedral through the Pb–Pb bond length of the upper and lower layer of the Pb–I octahedral geometry.
Nonetheless, the octahedral structure of the inorganic framework, and the hydrogen bond interaction with the organic MA cation also play a vital role in the structural variations. Fundamentally, such hydrogen bond interactions mainly govern the structural distortions in the inorganic network of PbI6. Hydrogen atoms attached with the nitrogen of the MA cation are involved in the hydrogen bond interaction, which simultaneously interacts with different iodine ions of the inorganic network (see Fig. 1). For symmetric rotations, A3 and A1 structures reveal the two hydrogen bonds, which are aligned in the same direction. However, two hydrogen bonds in the A2 and A4 structures are in a different direction. Similarly, the R3 structure exhibits the unidirectional hydrogen bonds with IM, while the rest of the random rotations reveal the multidirectional hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, the hydrogen bonds reduce to one for the case of the R1 structure. Specifically, the H of the MA cation in the R3 structure only interacts with the IM atoms, while the R2 structure has interacted with the iodine of the upper and lower layer of the Pb–I network. The hydrogen bond length in the considered structures ranges from 2.42 to 2.85 Å. For the ground-state geometry reported in an early study, three N–H⋯I bonds were observed. Such a structural variation and direction of the N–H⋯I bond are obtained from the orientation of the MA cation and might have an impact on the electronic and transport properties.
3.2 Electronic properties
We explored the impact of hydrogen bonds and disturbance in the inorganic Pb–I structure on the electronic properties of the 2DRP phase of the perovskite material through rotation of the MA cation. Fig. 2 shows a full Brillouin zone (BZ) band structure without SOC for varying orientations of the MA cation. The nature of the bandgap switched between direct and indirect through orientation of the organic cation in both types of rotations. A1 and A4 structures exhibit a direct bandgap at the S as well as X point of BZ. The shape of the valence band near the S point of BZ has been quite different for the A2 and A3 structures, compared to those of A1 and A4, which implies the indirect bandgap between the U and S point of the BZ. On the other hand, the R2 structure manifests the indirect bandgap of 2.32 eV, while the rest of the orientation of the MA cation (R1, R3, R4 and R5) reveals the direct nature of the bandgap. Given in the detailed investigation of the band edges, we observed that the conduction band minimum (CBM) values for each structure remain the same at the X point of BZ, which is mainly contributed by Pb 6p orbitals (see Fig. 3). On the other hand, for each direct bandgap structure (A1, A4, R1, R3, R4 and R5), valence band maximum (VBM) is located at two points X and S of BZ, while the same remains near the S point for the indirect nature of the bandgap. This observation indicates that the change in the shape of the valence band converts the nature of the bandgap from direct to indirect. It also realized from the projected density of states that the VBM for all structures majorly originated from the I 5p orbitals, which conclude that the movement of the iodine atom directly influences the nature of the bandgap. The movement of the iodine atom is directly linked to the orientation of the organic MA cation as discussed in the structural properties. Moreover, the rotation of the organic cation in the considered structures provoked the strain effects in the Pb–I network, which further give rise to distortion in Pb–I octahedral geometry. Such geometry change admits the switching of the bandgap nature, which may be due to the vdW dispersion forces between the organic cation and Pb–I framework.25 Apart from the direct-indirect transition, substantial fluctuation in the Pb–I network give rise to the significant alteration in band gap values from 2.35 to 1.87 eV (Table 2). For the case of the A4 structure, the flat nature of the VBM around the S point of the BZ leads to more negative energy, compared to others, which acquires the highest bandgap among the other structures. The calculated electronic band gap values for MA cation rotation in the 2D perovskite are in line with the previously reported experimental value by Stoumpos et al.20 Although the bandgap values calculated from DFT computations are underestimated, they can be further corrected through the use of the Bethe–Salpeter equation47 or GW approximation48 which might provide a more accurate electronic bandgap. Furthermore, including GW self-energy correction leads to the reversal of bandgap compared to the SOC correction.49 Therefore, it is needed to include both SOC and GW self-energy correction, nonetheless, such calculations are beyond the available computational resources for systems like hybrid perovskite materials.

Next, we calculated the projected density of states (PDOS), for getting depth to the impact of the MA cation rotation on the electronic structure and bonding mechanism. Fig. 3 and the above discussion suggests that the conduction band is featured by Pb 6p orbitals, while I 5p orbitals not only fully promote the valence band, but also show a little contribution towards the conduction bands. Furthermore, the presence of I 5p orbitals in the excited states (conduction band) might be the signature of the antibonding nature.39 However, the shape of DOS of I 5p orbitals in the conduction band is also identical to the Pb 6p orbitals, which suggests the strong hybridization between the antibonding orbitals of I 5p and Pb 6p. For the case of the A3 structure, the I 5px orbitals headed towards the higher energies, while Pb 6px orbitals turn along with the lower energy (i.e., toward the Fermi level) side, this implies the significant reduction in the bandgap (see Fig. S1 of the ESI†). For the structure R5, the I 5py orbitals significantly move towards the Fermi level compared to other structures, which originated in the extra peak in the valence band and reduces the overall gap. In the PDOS of the R5 structure a peak has been observed at the VBM, which is mainly originated from the Pb 6(px and py) orbitals (see Fig. S1 of the ESI†), and is responsible for lowering the bandgap. The electronic states of the organic cations lie in the deep energy levels (above 5 eV), which is far from the bandgap energy range. Therefore, the electronic state's contribution in total DOS distinctly disassociated the MA cation from the inorganic Pb–I framework.
Furthermore, charge density isosurfaces for the VBM and CBM are shown in Fig. S2 of the ESI,† which contributed to understanding the impact of the orientation of the organic cation on the electronic properties and charge transfer phenomena. The VBM and CBM iso-surfaces confirm that all the charges are localized around Pb and I atoms only, which suggests that the orientation of the organic cation indirectly influences the electronic nature of perovskite materials. A closer inspection of charge density surfaces reveals that layers of Pb–I differently contributed to the VBM and CBM. Here, iodine atoms from the upper layer contributed to the VBM, while the CBM is derived from the Pb atom of the lower layer. This suggests charge transfer occurs from the iodine of the upper layer to the Pb of the lower layer in the R1–R5 structures and depicts the possibility of out-of-plane transport between two layers of Pb–I during photovoltaic processes. Instead of influencing directly the band edges, the charge density iso-surface and PDOS indicate that the MA cation underpins the structural distortion of the Pb–I framework, which gives rise to diversity in electronic, optical and thermoelectric transport.
We now discuss the impact of MA cation orientation on the electronic properties with spin–orbit coupling (SOC). Breaking of inversion symmetry with strong spin–orbit interaction encourages the Rashba splitting in 2D electron gases.50–52 Such phenomena have a crucial application not only in the field of spintronics53 but are also pivotal to the charge carrier dynamics of perovskite materials.54 Accounting for the SOC effect, which leads to the fundamental electronic bandgap to lower by 0.46 to 0.30 eV for all considered rotation structures. The analysis between the band structures with and without SOC suggests that the lowest three conduction bands are majorly affected and shows the large separation between bands in BZ. This might be originated from the Pb atoms, which consist of the strong SOC energy compared to other elements present in the structure. Such a trend of the band structure with SOC is in good agreement with the previous report, where 3D MAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 structures result in a reduction of the bandgap by 0.5 eV and 0.8 eV, respectively.49 Indeed, the present work reveals that the valence bands are also moving towards the Fermi level, and contribute to the correction of the bandgap, while including the SOC effect, however, the separation between bands is not large enough compared to the conduction bands. In perovskite compounds, the valence and conduction band edges depict the variety of band behavior characterized by angular momentum.55,56 Here, the orbital and spin contributions are composed of the angular momentum behavior of the energy states.56 The calculated DFT-SOC projected DOS for all considered rotations are presented in Fig. S4 of the ESI.† The electronic states of Pb 6p split into two angular momentum configurations, J = 3/2 and J = ½, in the presence of SOC. The PDOS obtained from the DFT-SOC calculations indicates that the J = 3/2 falls towards the valence band edge, while J = ½ lies on the conduction band. However, near the Fermi level, the entanglement of J = 3/2 and J = ½ has been observed along the valence band side for Pb 6p. For the case of I 5p, the whole PDOS contains the major contribution from only J = 3/2 states. Such splitting in electronic states further leads to a reduction in the electronic bandgap with SOC. As discussed, the bandgap was significantly reduced for the case of DFT-SOC effects,57 and accordingly, we focused only on the impact of organic cation rotation on the nature of the band edges. It is worth noting that, apart from the similar features of the bands, there have been explicit differences scrutinized at the band edges. The presence of SOC results in the spin-split of the VBM around the X point of BZ for all considered structures (see Fig. S3 of the ESI†), while CBM shows the splitting of bands negligibly close to zero. Tilting of Pb–I octahedral geometry through MA cation rotation is associated with breaking of the inversion symmetry, which might underpin the energy splitting in the band structure. The energy splitting and momentum offset in k-space are tabulated in Table 2 for the VBM only as the Rashba splitting is forbidden under the SOC effects for the case of the CBM in the whole set of rotations. The parameter αR determines the strength of Rahsba splitting,1,41,53,58 which is presented in Table 2 along with the splitting energy and momentum offset. The maximum splitting strength is observed for the A2 structure, which is even higher than the previously reported ground state structure.41
Moreover, the calculated Rashba splitting strength is lower than the earlier reported 3D and 2DRP phases of perovskites.38–40 Furthermore, the strength parameter αR varies between 0.047 to 0.278 through the MA cation rotation, which suggests that the rotation of the MA cation significantly tunes the spin-dependent properties on 2D perovskites. The bulk MAPbI3 and other 2D halide-based hybrid perovskite materials depict the major contribution to Rashba splitting from the conduction band edges.40,58 In our case, the MA cation rotation directly imposes the movement of the iodine atom, which originated from the valence bands, and further results in the Rashba effect in the valence band edges only. Our previous investigation of molecular dynamics simulation on 2D hybrid perovskites also depicts the major contribution of the valence band in Rashba splitting.41 Furthermore, the radiative recombination rates of holes and photo-generated electrons are affected by such splitting phenomena, which is good for photovoltaic applications.59,60
3.3 Optical properties
Structural diversity with rotation of the MA cation in 2D perovskite leads to the vast optical properties that fall under the wide range of optical absorption spectrum. Specifically, the rotation of the MA cation may induce the variation in dipole moment with the Pb–I framework, which gives a strong response to the dielectric properties.27 We have calculated real (ε1) and imaginary (ε2) dielectric constants from the occupied and unoccupied states momentum matrix within the Brillouin zone selection rules and presented them along with the static dielectric constant in Fig. 4. The calculated static dielectric constant is identical for all the considered systems. The maximum peak height for ε1 is observed for the A1 structure in symmetric rotation, while the same is observed for R2 in random rotation. The real part of the dielectric constant is inversely proportional to the optical conductivity.61 This suggests that the A1 and R2 structure consisting of the lowest optical conductivity in comparison to other rotation structures. However, the A3 and R5 structures may exhibit the larger optical conductivity compared to other structures, due to the smaller peak of ε1. The optical conductivity is also in line with the obtained electronic bandgap, where A3 (1.87 eV) and R5 (1.95 eV) exhibit the lowest bandgap in the respective mode of rotation. In the present study, the direct optical transition gap value has been defined from the first peak of the imaginary part of dielectric constants. For all considered structures the first peak of ε2 has been observed between 3 and 4 eV, which suggests that the direct transition falls in the visible as well as an ultraviolet range of the spectrum. Furthermore, the ε2 peak energy of symmetric rotation experiences the blue shift upon increasing the angle of MA rotation (see Fig. 4). For the case of random rotations, the blue shift is observed for R3, R4 and R5 with respect to R1, while the R2 structure reveals the redshift resulting from the indirect electronic bandgap.
 Fig. 4  Calculated real (ε1) and imaginary (ε2) part of the dielectric constants (first and second column, respectively) as well as the absorption coefficients (α) (presented in the third column) as functions of photon energy for the considered orientation of the MA cation (A1–A4 and R1–R5 denotes the symmetric and random rotation). 
The MA cation orientation-dependent optical absorption spectrum for the considered 2D structures are investigated from the real and imaginary dielectric functions and presented in Fig. 4. For all considered structures, the absorption spectra depict quite differently in all crystallographic directions. Similar behavior was also observed in a previous study of lead-free 2D (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1GenI3n+1 layered perovskite materials.62 The onset of absorption shows quite a variation with the considered MA rotations. For symmetric rotation, the edge of adsorption is located at 439, 413, 403 and 466 nm wavelengths for A1 to A4 structures, respectively. It is to be noted that the orientation of the MA cation along the x-direction (for A1) and opposite to the x-direction (A3) leads to the greater value of absorption edge, while the wavelength has been shortened in the case of the A2 and A4 structures, where the MA cation aligned along the z-direction of the structure. Similarly, R3 and R5 structures exhibit the blue shift in the onset of absorption concerning the R2 and R4, respectively. Among all the considered rotations, the maximum value of the onset of absorption is found for the R5 structure, which is blue-shifted by 70 nm, concerning the A4 structure. Moreover, the random rotation shows a redshifted wavelength compared to the symmetric rotation except for the A3 structure. Similarly, the behavior of the absorption edge wavelength was also reported for the halide atom variation along with the rotational modes of the MA cation in MAPbX3 (where X are halide anions, Cl, Br and I).27 Moreover, the onset of absorption falls under the visible region, with a maximum variation up to 70 nm for the considered MA rotation. This suggests that different locations of organic cation in perovskite materials lead to an increase and reduction in the onset of absorption, which provides good tunability in optical properties for photovoltaic applications.
3.4 Thermoelectric properties
The thermoelectric power generators utilize the heat energy released from the exhaust of vehicles, industries, heavy machinery, etc. to generate electricity. Furthermore, solar heat energy can also be converted through solar thermal power generators. The performance of thermoelectric generators relies on the temperature gradient across the terminals with the thermoelectric figure of merit given by . Here, S, σ and κ are the thermoelectric transport coefficients, Seebeck coefficients, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity, respectively and T denotes the temperature. For a high capacity of conversion from the thermoelectric materials, a high power factor PF (S2σ) and a low thermal conductivity (κ) are required. However, the ZT is not only the parameter to regulate the efficiency of thermoelectric materials, the output power also has dominancy towards the improvement in heat energy conversion, indeed more desired for unlimited heat energy sources such as solar and industrial heat energy.63,64 Furthermore, the thermoelectric power factor of materials has a direct impact on output power density.65 Therefore, we focused on the impact of the rotation of the MA cation on the thermoelectric power factor and other transport coefficients in the considered 2D halide-based hybrid perovskite structures.
The operating temperature range for perovskite materials approximately falls in between the −20 to 85 °C (∼253 to 358 K).66,67 Therefore, we have calculated the temperature-dependent thermoelectric transport coefficients such as the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity for the 100 to 400 K temperature range. To determine the anisotropic behavior of the thermoelectric transport properties, we presented them with crystallographic directions x and z for all the rotations of the MA cation. The temperature-dependent Seebeck coefficients (S) for symmetric (A1–A4) and random (R1–R5) rotations of the MA cation are depicted in Fig. 5 (the Seebeck coefficient for the holes is presented in Fig. S5 of the ESI†). The negative and positive value of S defines the electrons and holes, respectively. The electronic bandgap and the density of states near the Fermi level play a key role in the modulation of the S. For the symmetric rotation, the highest S is achieved for the A4 structure, where the bandgap is also reported to be the highest among the considered structures (see Table 2). On the other hand, a similar nature was also found for random rotation, where the R5 structure reveals the lowest bandgap and the low value of S than the rest of the random rotations. We also observed that all the considered rotations of MA cations reveal an increase in the Seebeck coefficient with temperature. Shifting of the Fermi level towards a lower (higher) energy with an increase in temperature results in a gradual increase (decrease) of the Seebeck coefficient for n-type (p-type) charge carriers. Furthermore, for A1 and A3 structures, the Seebeck coefficients for negative charge carriers are similar, while the A2 and A4 structures also reveal the same value of S for the same along the x-direction. This suggests that the reverse orientation of the MA cation does not alter the S value for negative charge carriers in the symmetric mode of rotation. Furthermore, it also highlights that the Seebeck coefficient of symmetric rotation is more favorable for the MA orientation along the z-axis in comparison to the x-axis. On the other hand, the Seebeck coefficient for positive charge carriers does not follow the actual band gap nature. As discussed in the electronic band structure section, for all the structures, the CBM is located at the X and S point of BZ, while the VBM changed in between the X and S points of BZ. Therefore, the nature of the Seebeck coefficient for negative charge carriers is strictly dependent on the bandgap.
 Fig. 5  Anisotropic transport coefficients (for electrons), Seebeck coefficients (S), electrical conductivity (σ) and thermoelectric power factor (S2σ) for symmetric rotation (A1–A4) (left column) and random rotation (R1–R5) (right column) respectively. Here the solid and dashed lines determine the respective transport properties of the considered 2D perovskite along the x and z-axis of the crystal structure, respectively. 
The crystal direction-dependent anisotropic electrical conductivity for both structures with the orientation of an organic cation is presented in Fig. 5 (for electrons) and Fig. S5 of the ESI† (for holes). The electrical conductivity relies on the relaxation time, which is constant under the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation and therefore, deformation potential theory has been employed to obtain the relaxation time of charge carriers separately.68–71 Deformation potential theory appends the calculation of charge carrier mobility using the following expression which is widely utilized to derive the relaxation time68–74 (3)where C2D is the two-dimensional elastic constants derived from the second-order derivative of the total energy as a function of applied strain, and m* is the effective mass of the charge carrier obtained from the band structure along the x and z-directions. E1 is the deformation potential constants defined from the slope of the band edges with respect to the applied strain. , and T denote the Plank's constant (divided by 2π), Boltzmann's constant and temperature, respectively. All the quantities required for the calculations of mobility are presented in Table 3. Furthermore, the mobility of charge carriers has been utilized to obtain the electron and hole relaxation time using the expression: . We have estimated the anisotropic effective mass of electrons and holes along the x and z-axis of the considered structures. We observed that the effective masses of the electron along the x-axis are higher than that of the z-axis, for symmetric and random rotations of the MA considered 2D perovskite structure. On the other hand, the holes became lighter along the z-axis compared to that of the x-direction of the structures. For the case of the A1 structure, the valence band around the X point of BZ show constant values, which further results in much heavier holes with an effective mass of 2.501 m0 along the x-axis of the structure. Overall, it has been observed that the holes acquire higher effective masses than the electrons in both modes of rotations. The calculated effective mass of the charge carriers for the rotation structures is in line with the previously reported 2DRP perovskites, where the distortion is urged by the organic spacers.30,31 Furthermore, the rotation of the MA cation leads to volatility in the effective masses of electrons and holes. From Table 3, one has to point out that the hole effective masses are more volatile than that of the electrons. This volatile nature of the holes comes from the greater movements of the iodine atoms, where I 5p orbitals entirely contribute to the valence bands and change its parabolic nature significantly near the X point of the BZ. In contrast, the electrons do not show noteworthy changes in the respective crystallographic directions and rotations of the MA cation, which is attributed to the very slight variation in the shape of the bands at the conduction band edges.

Using the quantities m*, C2D and E1 we have calculated the mobility and relaxation time (τ). The obtained mobilities for all the rotation of the organic cation are in the range of typical semiconductors such as Si75 and GaAs.76 For electrons, the mobility is much higher than that of the holes for all considered rotations except for the R1 and A2 structures. The most common feature in these exceptional cases is the orientation of the MA cation along the z-axis, which creates a barrier for the transport of electrons from one Pb–I network to another one. Furthermore, the highest electron mobility of 1473.563 cm2 V−1 s−1 is achieved for the R3 structure in a random set of rotations, where the MA cation is aligned towards the positive x-axis. For symmetric rotations of the MA cation, the electron mobility is topmost for the case of the A1 structure, where also the MA cation aligned towards the x-axis of the structure. Furthermore, the MA cation orientation along the z-axis of the structure reveals trivial values compared to that of the x-axis orientation of the MA cation. Here, hydrogen bond orientations play a significant role in the mobility difference in symmetric rotations. For the case of A1 and A3, the hydrogen bonds were unidirectional, while A2 and A4 structures have shown the hydrogen bonds in two different directions, which have a significant impact on the charge transfer and results in such mobility variation. These crucial observations suggest that the MA cation orientation along the x-axis of the structure leads to the highest mobility and depicts the outrageous transport applications, which has been discussed in a subsequent section.
Following the anisotropic trend of the mobility of charge carriers, the relaxation time also manifests in the variation across the crystallographic direction as tabulated in Table 3. Both the structures depict the reduction in the electrical conductivity with increasing temperature. The electrical conductivity of the A1 and A3 structures is higher than the A2 and A4 structures, which is attributed to the electronic bandgap differences among the rotation structures. However, the conductivity of A1 is higher than that of A3, even after the bandgap of A3 is quite reduced. Here, the mobility of the A1 structure is much higher than that of the A3 structure, which gives rise to an increase in the relaxation time of the electron, further resulting in a higher electrical conductivity. For the case of a random set of rotation, the electrical conductivity of the negative charge carriers strictly follows the nature of mobility for the x and z directions of the structures. Furthermore, it has been observed that the conductivity of electrons is much higher than that of holes in all the considered structures, which suggests that electrons are more dominant in the transport properties of 2D perovskites. The obtained electrical conductivity is relatively higher than the ground state structure reported in a previous study,41 which might originate from achieving a high carrier mobility after the rotation of the MA cation in structures.
Such a large electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient may give rise to the thermoelectric power factor (PF), which leads to the superior output power density from thermoelectric power generators. The calculated PF values with a temperature range of 100–400 K are shown in Fig. 5 for electrons and Fig. S5 of the ESI† for holes. For symmetric rotations, the highest power factor of 1.93 mW m−1 K−2 is obtained for the A1 structure with negative charge carriers along the x-axis of the structure, which is mainly contributed by the electrical conductivity. For the case of a random set of rotations, the largest PF value of 3.08 mW m−1 K−2 is calculated for the R1 structure with positive charge carriers. Furthermore, for the A1, A3 and R1–R5 structures, the PF values first increase and then reduce with the temperature for electrons as the majority carriers, while hole-mediated PF values for all structures show gradual decrement with the temperature. Such a phenomenological behavior of PF can be understood from the domination of the Seebeck coefficient and electrical in the considered temperature range. At a temperature of 300 K, the random set of rotations increases the PF value up to 2.04 mW m−1 K−2 for the R3 structure along the x-axis for negative charge carriers, which is even bigger than the A1 structure. The significantly higher mobility of the R3 structure along the x-direction is responsible for this high value of power factor at room temperature. In both modes of MA rotations, the hole dominant PF is quite shortened, which implies electron dominancy in the transport properties at 300 K, as discussed earlier. However, below room temperature holes take a lead to drive PF at the utmost value in the considered 2D perovskite structures. Furthermore, the obtained PF values at a 1019 cm−3 carrier concentration and temperature of 300 K are much higher than the previously reported 3D traditional CH3NH3PbI3 and 2DRP structures.8,41 Overall, the obtained PF values are well tuned with MA cation rotation in the 2D perovskite structure, which suggests a wide range of promising applications in various thermoelectric devices for heat energy conversion.
4. Conclusions
The impact of the methylammonium rotation in 2D perovskites on the structural, electronic, optical and transport properties has been reported in the present work using density functional theory. We demonstrated that the distinct or random set of rotations of the MA cation in 2D perovskites indirectly contributed to the electronic structure and optical absorption. The hydrogen bond between the MA cation and the inorganic framework of Pb–I plays a vital role in the electronic and transport characteristics. A wide range of electronic bandgap values along with the Rashba splitting strength has been observed upon rotation of the MA cation. MA cation rotation further provides a wide range of optical absorption spectra, which might be useful for solar cell applications. The unidirectional and multidirectional hydrogen bonds between the MA cation and iodine of the Pb–I framework have a significant impact on the mobility of charge carriers. We pointed out that the unidirectional hydrogen bonds reveal superior charge carrier mobility, which further leads to improvement in the thermoelectric transport properties. In summary, this work delivers physical insights for interactions between the MA cation and Pb–I framework, which might be useful when designing 2D hybrid perovskite materials for solar and heat energy conversion.
