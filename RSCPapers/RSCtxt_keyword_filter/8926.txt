    , Accepted 19th December 2016First published on 19th December 2016AbstractThe molecular design of organic sensitizers is one of the fundamental factors for high-efficiency dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In this study, we first utilize the alkylated thieno[3,2-b]indole (TI) moiety as the π-bridge unit to enhance the π-bridge capability of the thieno[3,2-b]benzothiophene (TBT) used in organic sensitizers. To improve the spectral response of the SGT-130 reference dye, we strategically designed and synthesized two novel TI-based organic sensitizers, SGT-136 and SGT-137, through a simple change of the π-bridge unit. By replacing the TBT with the alkylated TI moiety, SGT-136 and SGT-137 could have a red-shifted absorption band and upshifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level. As a result, the SGT-137-based DSSC exhibits a higher PCE (12.45%) than that based on SGT-130 (9.83%) owing to the improvement of current density and retardation of charge recombination by the hexyl substituted TI unit. These results indicate that the TI moiety is a good candidate for remarkable π-electronic mediators in D–π–A organic sensitizers with the characteristic of facile synthesis compared to other complicated π-bridges. Furthermore, the parallel-connected tandem device with SGT-137 and SGT-021 porphyrin-based DSSCs shows a significantly improved current density (22.06 mA cm−2) and PCE (14.64%), which is the highest value reported for organic-based tandem solar cells to date.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as one of many promising photovoltaic devices, have received much attention from the viewpoints of their colourful and decorative nature, potential low cost, and high versatility in the design of new functional components.1 To enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs, the development of sensitizers plays an important role in the light-harvesting ability.2 Among the DSSCs, sensitizers can be categorized into three classes: (i) ruthenium (Ru)-based organometallic sensitizers,3 (ii) porphyrins,4 and (iii) metal-free organic sensitizers5 composed of donor–π–bridge-acceptors (D–π–A).
The Ru-based organometallic sensitizer denoted as N719 has been demonstrated to be an efficient dye with over 11% PCE when an iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) electrolyte is employed.6 The zinc porphyrin sensitizer (SM315) exhibited an impressive PCE of 13% using a cobalt-based electrolyte.7 Compared to the restricted ruthenium resource and low synthetic yield of porphyrin sensitizers, metal-free organic sensitizers have several advantages, such as the low cost of raw materials, high molar extinction coefficients, and flexibility of the molecular design. Currently, PCEs exceeding 12% have been achieved for metal-free organic sensitizer-based DSSCs employing a cobalt-based electrolyte.8
For the high PCE of D–π–A sensitizer-based DSSCs, the structural modifications of the π-bridge, including tuning the energy levels and the improvement of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from D to A of the sensitizer, are particularly essential.2a,9 On the basis of this concept, Eom et al. reported the thieno[3,2-b]benzothiophene (TBT) moiety as a new π-bridge in organic sensitizers (SGT-130, Fig. 1), exhibiting a relatively good PCE of 10.47%.10 Because the TBT π-bridge11 showed a weak electron-donating ability relative to the 4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) moiety,12 the development of a new π-bridge unit needs to facilitate efficient electron transfer from the D unit to the A unit. The strategies to improve the π-bridge ability can be defined by: (i) extending the conjugation length of the π-bridge,9,13 (ii) substituting the bridging atom in a fused-ring π-bridge,14 and (iii) increasing the electron-donating ability of the donor.15 In these strategies, the thieno[3,2-b]indole (TI) moiety was substituted with nitrogen (N) as the bridging atom in the sulphur (S) core atom of TBT (Fig. 1). Because the TI moiety, i.e., the indole-based structure that serves as one of the electron-rich five-membered thiophene rings, has a strong electron-donating ability and coplanarity,16 it has been commonly used as the donor group in the organic sensitizer, leading to an enhancement of the ICT effect and light-harvesting efficiency (LHE).17 Therefore, when the TI moiety is introduced as the π-bridge instead of the TBT unit, it can be expected to red-shift the ICT absorption band and enhance the LHE of the organic sensitizer.
 Fig. 1  Molecular design concept and chemical structures of alkylated thieno[3,2-b]indole (TI)-based organic sensitizers, SGT-136 and SGT-137 with the Ethyl-TI (red) and Hexyl-TI (green) π-bridge units. The reference dye SGT-130 with TBT (blue) is displayed for comparison. 
In this study, to improve the π-bridge ability, we first introduced the TI moiety as the π-bridge instead of the TBT of SGT-130, e.g., SGT-136 and SGT-137 (Fig. 1). For example, as the strategy to improve the LHE of SGT-130, SGT-136 was synthesized by using the ethyl-substituted TI (Ethyl-TI) moiety as the π-bridge. On the other hand, SGT-137 incorporated with the hexyl-substituted TI (Hexyl-TI) moiety showed retardation of the charge recombination and the prevention of dye aggregation, simultaneously, leading to a remarkably high PCE. In this contribution, the TI π-bridge bearing low levels of π-conjugation was demonstrated as the effective π-electronic mediator (Scheme 1), which should be strongly emphasized in terms of facile synthesis compared to complicated synthetic routes of other π-bridges.8a,8b,18 In addition to the molecular design of sensitizers, device engineering is also an important part of attaining a high PCE. Combined with co-sensitization19 and device optimization, Hanaya et al.20 have recently recorded a PCE of over 14% by using the alkoxysilylanchor sensitizer (ADEKA-1). As one of various methods for enhancement of PCE, tandem-DSSCs are a good candidate to improve the LHE by compensation of light absorption, which generally connect between a top and a bottom cell by a series or parallel configuration under the external circuit.21 The parallel tandem-DSSC (PT-DSSC) can maximize photocurrent density through compensation of the deficient absorption range between a top and a bottom cell.21c Our group recently reported a tandem-DSSC with an outstanding PCE of 14%, which connected by the PT-DSSC configuration with the SGT-02122 porphyrin sensitizer (bottom) and the SGT-12110 organic sensitizer (top).22b To enhance the current density by filling the poor absorption range between SGT-021 (bottom) and SGT-121 (top), we replaced the SGT-121 with SGT-137 as the organic sensitizer of the top cell. Based on this concept, the PT-DSSC with SGT-137 (top) and SGT-021 (bottom) shows a significantly improved current density (22.06 mA cm−2), and thus its PCE has reached 14.64%, which is the highest value among the organic-based tandem solar cells reported to date.

Results and discussion
The synthetic approaches to TI π-bridge-based organic sensitizers of SGT-136 and SGT-137 start from the corresponding alkyl-functionalized TI derivatives (3a for Ethyl-TI, 3b for Hexyl-TI) as depicted in Scheme 1. Compound 1 was linked with nitrobenzene and tributyl(2-thienyl)stannane by Stille coupling, which was cyclized using triphenyl phosphine to afford the TI (2). The alkylated TI derivatives (3a–b) were prepared through the simple alkylation of 2 with alkyl bromide in a basic medium. Compound 4 was coupled from alkylated TI derivatives (3a–b) and a biphenylamine donor (Scheme S1†) by the Buchwald–Hartwig C–N coupling reaction and then converted to 5 through bromination with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). Aldehyde derivative 6 was prepared using the Stille coupling reaction between stannyl derivatives of 5 and the BTD-P derivative. The final sensitizers of SGT-136 and SGT-137 were converted by Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacrylic acid. Novel SGT sensitizers were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopies, and their corresponding characterization data are summarized in the ESI.†
To preliminarily evaluate the abilities of individual π-bridge moieties, we first investigated the optical properties of three π-bridge units by measurement of the UV-vis absorption and emission (Table 1). As depicted in Fig. 2a, the replacement of TBT with the TI π-bridge unit has no influence on the molar absorption coefficient (ε). However, the maximum absorption wavelength (λabs max) of Ethyl-TI and Hexyl-TI is red-shifted by ca. 16 nm compared to that of the TBT unit (295.5 nm),16b which can be reproduced with the values of theoretical maximum absorption wavelength (λDFTabs max) and oscillator strength (f) by time-dependent-DFT (TD-DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G (d,p) level in tetrahydrofuran (THF) through the Gaussian 09 program23 (Fig. 2a and Table S1†).

In an effort to validate the strategy of this molecular design (Fig. 1), we further studied the electrochemical properties of TI π-bridge units in comparison to those of the TBT unit using cyclic voltammetry (CV) performed in CH3CN solution (Table 1 and Fig. S1†). The ground-state oxidation potentials (Eox) of Ethyl-TI and Hexyl-TI were upshifted by 0.32 and 0.33 V compared to that of the TBT unit by replacing the S with N in the bridging atom of the π-bridge unit (Fig. 2b),24 indicating that the TI moiety has a stronger electron-donating ability than TBT. Moreover, it can be expected that Eox values of SGT-136 and SGT-137 are higher than those of SGT-130, leading to a red-shift of the absorption band through the upshift of Eox values in final sensitizers. The excited-state oxidation potentials () of all π-bridge units, derived from the Eox value and optical energy band gap (E0–0), are −2.19, −2.32 and −2.32 V, respectively. E0–0 values are estimated from the intersection of the normalized absorption and emission spectra of all π-bridge units in THF solution, which are well matched with the theoretical energy levels and molecular orbitals (MOs) estimated by geometrical optimizations and TD-DFT calculations (Fig. 2b and Table S1†). To further obtain the detailed molecular orbital (MO) composition of each aromatic part in the π-bridge unit, partial density-of-state (PDOS) spectra were also presented with the percent contributions of electron population distribution (Fig. S2 and Table S2†). There is no difference in the contribution of the alkyl length between Ethyl-TI and Hexyl-TI at the bridging N atom (Table S2†).25 The contribution of the N bridging atom (48%) in the HOMO orbitals of TI units increased compared to that of the S atom (45%) in the TBT unit, suggesting that the π-bridge ability of the TI unit is stronger than that of the TBT unit. Based on the experimental and theoretical results of π-bridge units, it can be expected that the TI unit may be an effective π-bridge unit compared to the TBT unit.

Fig. 2c shows the UV-vis absorption and emission spectra of SGT sensitizers in THF solutions and their corresponding properties are summarized in Table 1. The narrow absorption band around 340 nm originates from the localized aromatic π–π* transitions due to the biphenylamine donor moiety.10,11 The major absorption band in the visible region (450–650 nm) is assigned to the ICT transition between D and A, which is mainly influenced by differences in the π-bridge ability. The λabs max values of ICT bands for SGT-136 and SGT-137 are significantly red-shifted by 17 and 28 nm compared to that of the SGT-130 (514.5 nm), which is correlated with the electron donating abilities of π-bridges above mentioned. The replacement of Ethyl-TI in SGT-136 by Hexyl-TI in SGT-137 results in a slight bathochromic and hyperchromic effect on the ICT band.26 The red-shifting of the ICT absorption band from SGT-130 to SGT-136 and SGT-137 is mainly related to the small decrease from 2.39 to 2.14–2.15° of the torsion angle between the π-bridge and the BTD unit, leading to efficient charge transfer from the D unit to the A unit.13d
The typical cyclic voltammograms of all SGT sensitizers are shown in Fig. S3,† and the corresponding electrochemical data are listed in Table 1. The Eox values of SGT-136 and SGT-137 were measured to be 0.97 and 0.96 V as compared to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), respectively, which were sufficiently lower than that of the redox potential of Co2+/Co3+ (0.59 V vs. NHE)27 for the application of DSSCs. The HOMO energy levels of SGT-136 and SGT-137 were remarkably higher than that of SGT-130 (Fig. 2d), indicating that the TI π-bridge unit has a significant influence on the HOMO energy level of the final sensitizer. The  values of SGT-136 and SGT-137 were found to be −0.95 and −0.94 V, respectively. As expected, the  values of all sensitizers are quite similar because of including the same benzothiadiazole-phenyl (BTD-P) auxiliary π-spacer, ensuring enough energetic barriers for electron injection from the excited state of sensitizers into the TiO2 conduction band (ECB = −0.5 V vs. NHE).1b
To get insight into the impact of the TI π-bridge unit correlated absorption spectra and energy levels, we also carried out the TDDFT calculation using the CAM-B3LYP functional in THF. The simulated absorption spectra can be in good agreement with the experimental red-shifting of the ICT absorption band from SGT-130 to SGT-136 and SGT-137. (Fig. S5 and Table S3†). The S0 → S1 transitions of all sensitizers contribute to the ICT band in the absorption spectra, which have prominent charge-transfer character from the HOMO to LUMO and the HOMO−1 to LUMO. As shown in Fig. 3b, the HOMO and HOMO−1 of all sensitizers are mainly delocalized on the biphenylamine donor and π-bridge units, while the LUMOs are predominantly located on the BTD-P unit and cyanoacrylic acid. In particular, the contribution from the HOMO to LUMO transition is obviously enhanced for SGT-136 and SGT-137 (56%) compared to that of SGT-130 (50%) (Table S3†). To deeply understand these contributions of the π-bridge unit, the percent contributions of individual groups from the PDOS spectra (Fig. S6 and Table S4†) are depicted in Fig. 3a. In the HOMO and HOMO−1 orbitals, the percent contributions of the π-bridge increased to 47% in the SGT-136 and SGT-137 from 35% in the SGT-130; it contributes to the red-shifting of the ICT absorption band. Moreover, the theoretically upshifted HOMO energy levels and reduced energy gaps of SGT-136 and SGT-137 (Table S3†) are consistent with the estimated HOMO energy levels (Table 1). In short, the calculated transition orbitals and percent contributions demonstrate that the TI π-bridge unit has a strong electron-donating ability compared to TBT, favoring the efficient charge transfer from D to A (Fig. 3).

(b) Distribution of frontier molecular orbitals involving the S0 → S1 transitions of the SGT sensitizers in THF. The isodensity surface values are fixed at 0.02. 
The photovoltaic performances of all SGT sensitizers were evaluated using a Co(bpy)32+/3+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) redox couple in acetonitrile. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics and the IPCE action spectra are plotted in Fig. 4, and the corresponding photovoltaic data are summarized in Table 2. The DSSC for SGT-130 afforded the averaged performances of Jsc = 16.07 mA cm−2, Voc = 807 mV, and FF = 0.74, corresponding to an overall PCE = 9.63%. As the device fabrication was focused on the optimization of DSSC performance for SGT-136 and SGT-137 sensitizers, the thickness of the active layer in the TiO2 film was thinner than the preliminary condition. Device fabrication was described in detail in the ESI.† The DSSCs based on SGT-136 (Jsc = 18.42 mA cm−2) and SGT-137 (Jsc = 18.83 mA cm−2) show a significant improvement in Jsc with respect to those based on SGT-130 (Jsc = 16.07 mA cm−2), suggesting that the substitution of the π-bridge unit from TBT to TI is a rational strategy for enhancement of photocurrent density. The increased Jsc and Voc of SGT-137 can be attributed to its long alkyl chain effect, which originates from the inhibition of dye aggregation and charge recombination by hexyl chains on the TI π-bridge.28 Among three sensitizers, the SGT-137-based DSSC with the chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) co-adsorbent exhibits the best performance with a Jsc of 18.83 mA cm−2, Voc of 818 mV and FF of 0.754, generating a superior PCE of 11.62%. As can be seen in Table 1, the improvement of optical properties for SGT-136 and SGT-137 resulted in enhanced Jsc, which is in good agreement with their IPCE performance and the amounts of the adsorbed dye (Fig. 4b and Table 2). The onsets of the IPCE spectra of SGT-136 and SGT-137-based DSSCs are almost the same as 780 nm with the good IPCE performance in the range of 500 to 620 nm. The SGT-137-based DSSC presented the highest IPCE of 76% at 550 nm, whereas SGT-130 has a lower IPCE of 70% at the same position.

To further understand the significant IPCE difference with the variation of sensitizers, we carried out time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) measurements using the time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) technique.29 In general, the film samples exhibit multi-exponential PL decay because of inhomogeneity of the sample as well as multiple relaxation processes involved. Therefore, the measured TR-PL signals (IPL) were fitted by multiple exponentials convoluted with the instrument response function (IRF) as follows: (1)where Ai denotes the fractional amplitude of each exponential that satisfies the relationship of , and τi represents the time constant of each exponential component. The IRF was separately measured by detecting the scattering from the sample at the excitation wavelength. To simplify the comparison between different samples, the average time constant of the multi-exponential decay was determined by the relationship of . The SGT dye-adsorbed alumina (Al2O3) films showed a strong emission peak upon laser excitation at 393 nm. The PL decays (black lines in Fig. S7†) featuring amplitude-averaged lifetimes  (Table S5†) can be attributed to the irradiative and non-irradiative deactivations of the excited-state dye due to the absence of the energy-offset needed for electron injection at the Al2O3 and sensitizer interface. The  values of SGT-136 (0.49 ns) and SGT-137 (0.47 ns) are shorter than that of SGT-130 (1.22 ns), indicating that there could be strong intermolecular interactions in dye-adsorbed oxide films despite the fact that the alkyl chain was attached to the π-bridge unit of sensitizers.13c However, the replacement of the Al2O3 film with a TiO2 film brings a remarkable shortening of  (0.32 ns for SGT-130, 0.23 ns for SGT-136 and 0.21 ns for SGT-137, Table S5†), resulting in the electron injection from the excited-state dye to the CB of TiO2. By employing the 〈τav〉 values of TiO2 and Al2O3 samples, we estimated the electron injection efficiencies (ηinj) of the SGT-130, SGT-136 and SGT-137 using eqn (2), being 74.2, 81.2 and 83.0%, respectively (Table S5†). ηinj = 1−(τTiO2)/(τAl2O3)(2)
The different ηinj values might contribute to the IPCE value despite the minor quantity of non-electron-injecting dye molecules in the cells, but that does not mean that electron injection efficiency is the only factor governing the IPCE variation. Given the IPCE spectra in the region from 550 to 800 nm for SGT-136 and SGT-137-based DSSCs (Fig. 4b), the enhanced IPCE is significantly affected by LHE, originated from the red-shift of the ICT absorption band by tuning the π-bridge unit (Fig. 2c), leading to an improvement of Jsc (Fig. 4a). That is, the variation of IPCE is governed by the electron injection efficiency and LHE since the introduced TI π-bridge unit facilitates charge transfer into the sensitizer.
To optimize the DSSC performance, we replaced the co-adsorbent from the CDCA to the HC-A1, which broke up dye aggregates and improved the light-harvesting effect in the short wavelength region, leading to a significant enhancement in the Jsc and Voc by suppressing charge recombination and increasing the electron lifetime.30 Upon changing the co-adsorbent from CDCA to HC-A1 in the SGT-137-sensitized cell, the SGT-137/HC-A1-based DSSC showed a significantly improved PCE of 12.25% (Jsc = 18.16 mA cm−2, Voc = 879 mV, and FF = 0.76) compared to the SGT-137/CDCA-based DSSC (Table 2), which showed a remarkable increase of Voc, but slightly decreased the Jsc value due to the decreased dye-adsorbed amount of SGT-137 by bulky HC-A1. The decrease of Jsc from the change of the co-adsorbent can also confirm the IPCE onset value in the IPCE action spectra (Fig. 3b). To examine the DSSC performances employing the traditional I−/I3− electrolyte, all SGT sensitizer-based DSSCs were assembled under the identical conditions of the device fabrication described above, except for the electrolytes. The overall PCEs under the I−/I3− electrolyte were in the narrow range of 7.51–7.81% (Fig. S8 and Table S6†). Among the recorded data, the SGT-137-based DSSC exhibited a PCE of 7.81% (Jsc = 18.05 mA cm−2, Voc = 655 mV, FF = 0.66), which is much lower than that of the Co(bpy)32+/3+ electrolyte.
To elucidate the variation of Voc among DSSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed under a forward bias of −0.77 V in the dark, as summarized in Fig. 5a.31 The Nyquist and Bode plots are depicted in Fig. S9† and listed in Table 3. As shown in Fig. S9a,† the second semicircles corresponding to charge transport and recombination resistance (Rtr and Rrec) are determined by the charge recombination rate between TiO2 and the electrolyte. A larger Rrec value indicates a slower charge recombination and a higher Voc. The Rrec values of the DSSCs increase in the following order: SGT-136 (64.46 Ω) < SGT-130 (66.51 Ω) < SGT-137 (76.27 Ω) < SGT-137/HC-A1 (114.4 Ω), implying that the charge recombination rate decreased in this order. The electron lifetime (τr) obtained from τr = Cμ·Rrec was 25.5, 23.6, 29.3 and 37.9 ms for SGT-130, SGT-136, SGT-137 and SGT-137/HC-A1, which could be also confirmed in the mid-frequency region of the Bode phase plot (Fig. S9b†) in good accordance with the tendency of Voc values. The slow-charge recombination in the SGT-137-based DSSC can be attributed to the long alkyl chain effect of the Hexyl-TI π-bridge unit.26,28 With combined information from the dye loading amount as well as the Voc and τr values from electrical measurements, we could imagine that the insertion of the hexyl chain at the nitrogen atom may bring forth the prevention of Co(bpy)33+ ions from approaching towards the TiO2 surface, as pictorially illustrated in Fig. 5c, which can reduce down the interfacial charge recombination processes.12b,32 Moreover, the Rrec and τr for the SGT-137/HC-A1-based DSSC were larger than those of the DSSC using the CDCA, which is regarded as the significant synergy effect between the prevention of dye-aggregation by HC-A1 and retardation of the charge recombination by the long hexyl chain for SGT-137. Therefore, the charge collection efficiency (ηcc) values derived from ηcc = (1 + Rtr/Rrec)−1 or ηcc = (1 + τn/τr)−1 for all DSSCs are shown in Fig. 5a and Table 3, which rank as follows: SGT-137 > SGT-136 > SGT-130.

The intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) measurements were performed to estimate the electron transport and recombination dynamics in all DSSCs (Fig. S9†). The IMPS results indicate that the electron transport time (τn) for the SGT-137-based DSSC is shorter than that of the other sensitizer-based cell at varied light intensities, which can be related to great charge generation in the SGT-137-based DSSC (Fig. S9c†). The IMVS reflects recombination processes in the DSSCs (Fig. S9d†), and shows that the electron lifetime (τr) for the SGT-137-based cell is longer than those of others, which is in good agreement with the electron lifetime calculated from the Bode plots (Fig. S9b†).
To scrutinize the mass transport limitation of the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox couple in complete DSSCs, the photocurrent transient dynamics were also studied using multistep on/off modulation of the incident light under the AM1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2).33 As the light was switched on, the maximum photocurrent was observed, and then it decreased and reached a constant value after a few seconds of illumination time. As shown in Fig. S10,† the ratio of initial peak current to steady-state current of all DSSCs decreased significantly due to the slow diffusion of redox species, indicating that the retardation of mass transport can also lead to losses in the photocurrent of the DSSC. Moreover, for the analysis of charge recombination kinetics in DSSCs, open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) was measured to illustrate the Voc decay time (τr) (Fig. S10†).34 We monitored the transient Voc as a function of time upon switching off the light. After illumination, the slope of decay curves in the OCVD plots exhibited the same trend of Voc values. Compared to the SGT-137-based DSSC, the DSSC for SGT-136 revealed a severe decay curve due to fast charge recombination, which confirmed the results of EIS analysis and graphical representation (Fig. 5). The Voc of the SGT-137/HC-A1-based DSSC showed suggestively slower decay rates relative to other sensitizers with CDCA, proving that HC-A1 affects the slow-charge recombination by preventing the intermolecular electron loss. These DSSCs were subjected to preliminary measurement of light-soaking stability. Fig. S11† shows the detailed photovoltaic parameters of the devices under constant irradiance by an AM 1.5 G solar simulator at 50 °C. As a result, most DSSCs exhibited 85–88% of the initial PCE after light soaking for 10 days, suggesting that the molecular design of anchoring groups needs to minimize the dye desorption and improve the long-term device stability of DSSCs.

SGT-137 was proved to be an efficient organic sensitizer with high performance through the device engineering, but the light absorption ability in the near-infrared (NIR) region needed strengthening. To compensate for this weakness of absorption ability in the NIR region, we applied the tandem-DSSC technique with an advantage of easy device fabrication by simple connection of the top and bottom cell (Fig. 6a).21 As the PT-DSSC can maximize the current density, the SGT-021 porphyrin sensitizer22 was chosen as a suitable sensitizer in the bottom cell in order to compensate for the weak absorption ability of SGT-137 in the NIR region (700–800 nm) and the visible region (450 nm) (Fig. 6b and S12†). In this regard, we present an innovative architecture (Fig. 6a) for the PT-DSSC, which is composed of an SGT-137-based top cell and an SGT-021-based bottom cell. The J–V characteristics of the tandem DSSCs and the corresponding IPCE action spectra are presented in Fig. 6c and d, respectively. The PT-DSSC showed a significantly improved PCE of 14.64% with Jsc = 22.06 mA cm−2, Voc = 878.4 mV, and FF = 0.756 (Table 4), which is substantially higher than previous tandem-DSSCs.21b The integrated current density from the measured IPCE spectra was lower than the experimentally measured Jsc, exhibiting a less than 5% error (Fig. 6d).8b,35 A histogram of four different top and bottom cells is shown in Fig. S13.† The increase of Jsc in the PT-DSSC was also demonstrated by the synergistic effect of IPCE action spectra between SGT-137 and SGT-021 (Fig. 6d), which is in good agreement with the concept of improving the absorption ability in the visible and NIR regions. If further structural modifications of sensitizers are carried out, the performance of tandem-DSSCs is expected to exceed a PCE of over 15%.

Conclusions
Novel D–π–A organic sensitizers SGT-136 and SGT-137 have been designed and synthesized with the purpose of improving the π-bridge ability of the SGT-130 reference sensitizer. The experimental results (e.g., the optical and electrochemical properties, combined with the theoretical calculations of π-bridge units) confirmed that the TI unit is a better candidate for an effective π-bridge unit compared to the TBT unit for a red-shifted absorption band and narrow energy band-gap. Compared to SGT-130, SGT-136 and SGT-137 sensitizers presented notable bathochromic shifts of ICT absorption wavelength and increased molar absorption coefficients. The IPCE response of the SGT-137-based DSSC extended to nearly 800 nm, reflecting the improved light-harvesting ability of the TI π-bridge unit. The hexyl substituent on the TI π-bridge for SGT-137 had a significant influence on the prevention of dye aggregation and charge recombination. The SGT-137-based DSSC exhibited a superior PCE of 11.62% using the CDCA co-adsorbent, the performance of which is much higher than that of SGT-130. More interestingly, the SGT-137/HC-A1-based DSSC exhibited a remarkably enhanced PCE of 12.45% compared to the SGT-137/CDCA-based DSSC. Based on these results for DSSCs, we finally applied the tandem-DSSC technique to achieve the panchromatic sensitization. Furthermore, the parallel-connected tandem device with an SGT-137-based top cell and SGT-021-based bottom cell showed a significantly improved current density (22.06 mA cm−2) and exhibited a high PCE (14.64%). This work may pave the way for the molecular engineering of TI-based D–π–A organic sensitizers for high-efficiency DSSCs.
Experimental section
Materials
Details on the chemical synthesis and characterisation, cell fabrication methods, photophysical and photoelectrochemical measurements are described in the ESI.†
Theoretical calculation methods
All the theoretical calculations were performed with the Gaussian 09 program23 package on a computer workstation. The ground-state geometries of all π-bridge moieties and sensitizers in the tetrahydrofuran (ε = 7.43) condition and the gas phase were fully optimized without symmetry constraints using Becke's three-parameter hybrid function and Lee, Yang, and Parr's correlational function (B3LYP) using the 6-31G(d,p) basis set for all atoms. The electron density difference diagram and theoretical absorption spectra were calculated by TD-DFT at the same levels of theory for tetrahydrofuran and the gas phase. The total density of states and partial density of states (PDOS) of π-bridges and sensitizers were calculated using the geometry obtained by B3LYP optimization using GaussSum 3.0.
Measurements
UV/Vis absorption spectra were obtained in THF on a Shimadzu UV-2401PC spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence spectra were analysed with a Fluorolog FL-3-22 fluorometer from Horiba-Jobin-Yvon Ltd. equipped with a 450 W Xe-lamp and two analyzing monochromators. Visible emission spectra were detected with a Hamamatsu R928 photomultiplier. Cyclic voltammetry was measured on a Versa STAT3 (AMETEK). The three-electrode system used consisted of a reference electrode (Ag/AgCl), a working electrode (dye-coated TiO2 films and a Pt plate), and a counter electrode (Pt wire). The redox potentials of dyes were measured in acetonitrile and tetrahydrofuran with 0.1 M TBAPF6 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of DSSCs were measured with an impedance analyzer (VersaSTAT3, AMETEK) connected to a potentiostat under dark conditions at room temperature. The spectra were scanned in a frequency range of 0.1 to 105 Hz and an amplitude of 10 mV at room temperature. Intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS) and intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) were performed on an IviumStat (Ivium Technologies, Netherlands), which supplied the modulated light. IMVS and IMPS were measured under the illumination of an LED light source (λ = 635 nm) with different light intensities. The frequency range was 0.5 Hz to 500 Hz.
