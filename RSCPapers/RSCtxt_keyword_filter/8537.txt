, Accepted 16th August 2016First published on 16th August 2016AbstractIn this work, a facile sequential thermal evaporation strategy in low vacuum (STELV) is proposed to achieve good crystallization of CH3NH3PbI3 films with controllable grain size. Through a comparative study, it is observed that the photovoltaic parameters of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are closely related to the CH3NH3PbI3 grain size, and large grains should contribute to a superior performance and a small hysteresis index. Also, we demonstrate that the declining performance can be ascribed to a high carrier combination rate caused by superfluous perovskite grain boundary (PGB) traps. By combination with Silvaco simulation software based on physical models, the recombination rate distribution within PSCs is clearly observed. In addition, the lateral conduction band energy distribution within CH3NH3PbI3 films and the transient carrier collection efficiency are also displayed, suggesting that PGB traps are prominently responsible for inferior device performance by causing serious lateral transport of photo-generated carriers and reducing their collection efficiency, which is consistent with experimental results.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskites (e.g. CH3NH3PbI3 or CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) have increasingly excited the research community around the world, as one of the most appealing materials for photovoltaic application during the past few years, owing to their fascinating characteristics, such as high absorption coefficients (>104 cm−1),1 long carrier diffusion lengths (100–1000 nm),2 and tunable optical band gaps,3–6 as well as simple and low-cost spin-coating technology.5–10 To date, the development of PSCs has witnessed tremendous progress. The certified champion efficiency for PSCs quoted by NREL has reached 22.1%, rivaling that of single-crystal silicon solar cells. In addition, Snaith et al. have recently presented highly crystalline and photostable perovskite material by replacing the organic CH3NH3+ ion with hybrid organic HC(NH2)2+ and inorganic Cs+ ions, and further combining this with a silicon cell, achieving >25% for four-terminal tandem cells.4 Meanwhile, a few groups have revealed the origin of poor stability for perovskite films, including temperature,11,12 ambient humidity,13 and light and oxygen induction.14 As such, long-term stability tests for PSCs stored in air at room temperature without encapsulation are carried out for over 1000 h under full sunlight,8,12,15,16 which shows their promising future practical application.
Presently, although a plethora of innovative approaches to fabricating CH3NH3PbI3 films have been proposed in many literature reports, including one-step deposition,5–8 sequential deposition,16–18 and evaporation deposition in high vacuum,19 one of the most crucial issues for PSCs to be addressed is the morphology and grain-size control of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer, which plays a crucial role in the performance of PSCs.6,20 Moreover, Huang et al. and Ohkita et al. have revealed that numerous perovskite grain boundaries (PGB) should have a unfavorable effect on the performance of PSCs due to possessing superfluous charge traps.21,22 Unfortunately, it is well recognized that CH3NH3PbI3 films fabricated by the aforementioned methods often exhibit wide variations in the CH3NH3PbI3 grain size.20 Worse still, CH3NH3PbI3 films also exhibit extensive fluctuation in grain size, even when prepared under identical processing conditions. To reduce the PGB trap density resulting from a varied grain size, some attempts have consequently been made to passivate or enlarge the grain size.23,24 In particular, increasing the CH3NH3PbI3 grain size is appealing,20,24,25 and the monomeric size of PSCs has reached 1 cm2.8 On the other hand, the majority of reported approaches for preparing CH3NH3PbI3 films are restricted to glove boxes filled with either nitrogen or a high vacuum atmosphere, which naturally increases the fabrication cost of PSCs. It is therefore necessary that a low-cost approach for preparing controllable CH3NH3PbI3 grains should be proposed.
Additionally, despite the fact that PGB traps are responsible for many unusual electrical behaviors within PSCs, as demonstrated by experimental progress,20,21,25–27 the understanding of the origin of their role is very limited. Also, some fundamental physical mechanisms regarding PSCs still cause confusion, and there is a lack of evidence for related theories mentioned in the literature.
Herein, we firstly report a facile sequential thermal evaporation strategy in low vacuum (STELV) for fabricating CH3NH3PbI3 films with controllable grain size, in which PbI2 and CH3NH3I powder are deposited on a compact TiO2 substrate in low vacuum, followed by a solid-state rapid insertion reaction during the process of annealing at 150 °C by virtue of the high concentration gradient of CH3NH3I. By incorporating these into PSCs, distinctly different photovoltaic parameters are attained with controllable CH3NH3PbI3 grain sizes. To obtain a better understanding of these differences, the fundamental recombination behavior within PSCs is carefully investigated with the help of Silvaco simulation software. Furthermore, the lateral conduction band energy distribution and transient carrier collection efficiency are also exhibited, which cannot easily be achieved by routine measurements, demonstrating that superfluous carrier transport across the lateral direction occurs when the PGB trap density is high (>1 × 1014 cm−3), and that large CH3NH3PbI3 grains are necessary for efficient PSCs.
2. Experimental methods
Characterization
The surface and cross-section morphology of CH3NH3PbI3 films were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi SU8010). X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Philips PANalytical X'Pert Pro, Cu Kα) was used to acquire the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal orientation. The CH3NH3PbI3 absorption spectra were measured with a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Cary 5000). The PL spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 films were recorded using a steady-state fluorescence spectrometer (FL3-2-IHR221-NIR-TCSPC). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of PSCs were measured with an Abet Sun 2000 solar simulator under illumination of AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) at regular time intervals (0.02 V S−1 scan speed). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (METEK) was employed to characterize the transfer dynamics of PSCs. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was measured to demonstrate the photoelectric response of the PSCs.
Device fabrication
The PSCs were prepared according to the construction shown in Fig. 1a and b. Firstly, neat FTO glass substrates were washed with a mixed solution of ethanol and acetone (1:1 volume ratio) via sonication for 15 min, and then sequentially washed with isopropanol for 15 min. Prior to depositing a compact TiO2 film, the FTO substrates were treated in a UV-ozone cleaner for 12 min. A compact TiO2 layer, about 50 nm thick, was formed on the cleaned FTO glass by a sol–gel method, according to our previous report.7 With regard to the CH3NH3PbI3 film fabricated by STELV, 50 mg PbI2 powder was firstly evaporated on the substrate via thermal evaporation in a low vacuum (∼1 Pa), with a 60 A evaporation current, and subsequently superfluous CH3NH3I powder was evaporated on the formed PbI2 film to make sure that the transformation from PbI2 to CH3NH3PbI3 was complete. The adoption of 50 mg PbI2 was chosen to attain an optimized CH3NH3PbI3 thickness. During the process of annealing at 150 °C, the CH3NH3PbI3 film was assembled by interaction and interdiffusion between solid-state PbI2 and CH3NH3I components. Finally, the formed CH3NH3PbI3 film was washed with isopropanol to remove redundant CH3NH3I. A higher annealing temperature, compared with common reports, was adopted because a higher temperature could be beneficial in forming large CH3NH3PbI3 grains.20,24 And a higher temperature should facilitate the interdiffusion reaction and crystallization. In order to control the CH3NH3PbI3 grain size by STELV, the evaporation rate was controlled by changing the evaporation current. Furthermore, a P3HT solution was prepared by dissolving 15 mg P3HT in 1 ml chlorobenzene, to which 18 μl of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) solution (280 mg ml−1 acetonitrile) and 10 μl of 4-tert-butylpyridine were added. The hole-transport layer was prepared by spin-coating P3HT solution at 3000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, a 150 nm thick gold counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation and the dot area of the PSCs was 0.06 cm2.

3. Results and discussion
The evaporation rate strongly affected the growth rate of CH3NH3PbI3 film, thereby varying the CH3NH3PbI3 grain size. Initially, SEM was conducted to observe the grain size of CH3NH3PbI3 prepared by STELV and Fig. 2 shows the surface and corresponding cross-section morphology of CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared with 70 A, 65 A, and 60 A evaporation current. It was noted that, at the same scale, there were smaller grains in the sample prepared at 70 A, showing that a higher evaporation current inhibited the production of large CH3NH3PbI3 grains. Besides, the average CH3NH3PbI3 grain size increased significantly as the evaporation current decreased, owing to a low evaporation rate, which might be related to the volume expansion, as demonstrated by Zhao et al.17 As shown in Fig. 2, it could be estimated that the grain sizes were about 250 nm, 350 nm, and 600 nm, corresponding to 70 A, 65 A, and 60 A evaporation current, respectively. Apart from the variation in grain size, all the samples exhibited dense morphologies, facilitating the reduction of leakage current.7 In order to obtain a more precise validation of the perovskite structure, the corresponding XRD evolution patterns were obtained and were displayed in Fig. S1;† two preferential XRD diffraction peaks at 14.17° and 28.51° were detected, which were assigned to the (110) and (220) tetragonal perovskite crystal planes. The full width at half maximum of the (110) diffraction peak was reduced as the evaporation current decreased from 70 A to 60 A, which was in good agreement with the SEM results. In addition, the UV-vis absorption spectra of the CH3NH3PbI3 samples were shown in Fig. S2,† in which all the films exhibited nearly identical absorption situation, due to their possessing the same thickness, as determined by the cross-section SEM measurements shown in Fig. S3.†

Then, to examine the impact of the CH3NH3PbI3 grain size on the device performance, the prepared CH3NH3PbI3 films were used to assemble planar PSCs with the configuration shown in Fig. 1b. Fig. 3a shows J–V curves of the PSCs obtained from a short-circuit to open-circuit scanning direction (FS), and from an open-circuit to short-circuit scanning direction (RS). All the measurements for J–V curves were carried out at regular time intervals (0.02 V s−1 scan rate) in air atmosphere, and the corresponding parameters were shown in Table 1, including the hysteresis index (HI) defined by eqn (1) to numerically confirm the degree of hysteresis. JRS (0.8 Voc) and JFS (0.8 Voc) represent the current density at 0.8 Voc in the RS and FS directions, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3a, an authentic J–V hysteresis situation was exhibited, in which the determined efficiency was strongly dependent on the voltage scanning direction, which was generally interpreted to be due to the influence of defects, charge selective contacts, ion mobility, and ferroelectricity.26–28 Devices possessing smaller grain size showed a larger hysteresis index compared with those possessing large ones (other conditions being identical), which indicated that the smaller the perovskite grain size, the severer the J–V hysteresis. In order to further understand the relationship between hysteresis and the perovskite grain size, further discussion is presented later in this article. On the other hand, the overall device performance obviously declined when the perovskite grain size decreased from 600 nm to 250 nm, irrespective of the scanning direction. Meanwhile, the corresponding EQE was shown in Fig. 3b, and this also exhibited the same descending trend with decreasing grain size. Considering the parallel absorption spectrum (shown in Fig. S2†), it was therefore justified that the inferior current should be ascribed to poor carrier collection, arising from high recombination resulting from a rich PGB trap density. Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed to characterize the charge transfer dynamics of the PSCs, and corresponding Nyquist plots were shown in Fig. 3c. The first semicircle indicated the strong interfacial influence associated with compact TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/P3HT.29,30 Hence, the increased resistance at the first semicircle, ranging from 225 ohm to 414 ohm, would illustrate an increasing transport resistance over the whole device, which validated the decrease in fill factor (FF). As a consequence, it was unveiled that the overall device performance declined as the CH3NH3PbI3 grain size decreased. Finally, we counted the performance distribution of PSCs, based on a 60 A evaporation current for 40 devices, whose average and standard deviation for the 40 devices were 0.85% and 1.1%, respectively, estimated from the histogram of efficiency distribution (shown in Fig. 3d), indicating favorable reproducibility for PSCs fabricated by STEVL.

To further confirm our assumption, steady-state PL measurements for CH3NH3PbI3 films prepared with different grain sizes were performed. Given that perovskite films often present polycrystalline characteristics,21 it is expected that numerous crystal flaws exist in the perovskite surface or PGB, caused by dangling bonds, which have a significant influence on the density of space charge in CH3NH3PbI3 films and recombination statistics within PSCs, by exchanging charges with conduction and valence bands through the emission and capture of carriers. As shown in Fig. 4a, a lower evaporation current represented a larger grain size, with a higher emission intensity. It is well known that the emission intensity originates from direct recombination between generated electrons in conduction bands and holes in valence bands. Consequently, a small emission intensity could be affected by nonradiative recombination related to trap centers hindering the emission. A large grain size reduced the PGB region, thereby decreasing the trap-state density. According to previous reports,7,30,31 when illumination was applied, photo-generated carriers would undergo the following physical processes in PSCs: diffusion, recombination, and collection. As shown in Fig. 4b, the generated carriers were ideally effectively collected by vertical transport in PSCs. However, a portion of electrons were injected into trap centers for recombination, causing lateral movement of carriers that did not favor carrier collection and thereby contributing to a poor device performance.

Furthermore, we simulated the J–V performance of PSCs, based on different PGB trap-state densities, which were specified between CH3NH3PbI3 grains (shown in Fig. 1a). The black edge between the perovskite grains was denoted as PGB region. To prepare a device model simulation, we must first define a reasonable mesh corresponding to the cross section of PSCs, which covered the physical simulation domain (shown in Fig. S4†). All the electrical parameters related to simulation were listed in Table S1,† with reference to other literature reports.4,22,32,33 Besides, the refractive index (n) and extinction coefficient (k) spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 films were shown in Fig. S5,† according to ref. 34. Fig. 5a shows the simulated J–V curves with different PGB trap-state densities, ranging from 1 × 1011 cm−3 to 1 × 1015 cm−3. It was indicated that, as the PGB trap-state density increased, the device performance significantly degenerated, and experimental results showed exactly the same trend. It was therefore concluded that PGB traps indeed resulted in poor device performance. Meanwhile, we also simulated PSCs with different grain bulk trap-state densities, ranging from 1 × 1011 cm−3 to 1 × 1015 cm−3, to compare with the situation with PGB traps. By observing the degeneration of efficiency versus the trap-state density, in sharp contrast, the power conversion efficiency was particularly sensitive to the PGB trap density (shown in Fig. 5b). With regard to bulk traps, the efficiency variation was marginal as long as its value could be controlled below a relatively low value (<1 × 1015 cm−3), which was easily achieved by improving perovskite crystallization.

Typically, three types of universal recombination kinetics should be considered to accurately investigate the recombination behavior in solar cells, namely, phonon transition (nonradiative generation/recombination), photon transition (radiative generation/recombination), and Auger generation/recombination.4,22 However, Auger generation/recombination occurs through a three-particle transition, which is mainly important for wide-gap semiconductors, and is negligible in CH3NH3PbI3. In addition, the net photon transition is a direct transition between conduction band electrons and valence band holes, which should be ascribed to eqn (2), where Ropt represents the net photon transition rate, and the constant, Copt, represents the radiative recombination factor corresponding to CH3NH3PbI3, regardless of the trap density. Here, n (p) represents the concentration of electrons and holes, obtained by solving coupling eqn (3)–(6). Due to the material being identical, we assumed that Copt was 1.5 × 10−10 cm−3 over the entire simulation. Moreover, phonon transition occurs in the presence of trap centers within the forbidden gap of perovskite, which is significantly related to our discussed PGB trap density and needs to be considered carefully. In general, the net photon transition should be ascribed to eqn (7), when considering the role of trap assistance, where Rsrh represents the net phonon transition rate, and Cn and Cp are specified as carrier capture cross sections for electrons and holes at trap sites, respectively, Nt is the density of trap states with an energy Et in the forbidden gap (shown in Fig. S6†), and n1(p1) is the equilibrium value of electrons (holes). Consequently, the total recombination rate should be applied to eqn (8).

Fig. 6 clearly showed the total recombination rate distribution in PSCs with varying PGB trap-state densities ranging from 1 × 1011 cm−3 to 1× 1015 cm−3. Obviously, if the CH3NH3PbI3 film possessed a large enough grain size with no PGB traps in the device model, then the recombination rate distribution would ideally conform to a Gaussian distribution with the peak value at the highest generation rate (shown in Fig. 6b and c). However, once a PGB trap-state density was specified, even with a low value of 1 × 1011 cm−3, the recombination rate distribution showed obvious variation, in which the primary high recombination rate was concentrated in the PGB region. And the recombination rate inside the CH3NH3PbI3 grain bulk could be negligible when compared to the PGB region, suggesting that carriers might flow from the bulk to the boundary region, participating in high-speed recombination processes across the lateral direction, as mentioned in Fig. 4b. In addition, as the PGB trap density increased, the recombination rate in the whole PGB region became homogeneous, unlike the situation with a low trap density.

In order to further confirm the role of PGB traps, the spatial conduction band energy distribution across the lateral direction was simulated. As shown in Fig. 7, when the PGB trap density was low (<1 × 1012 cm−3), there were no obvious differences. In sharp contrast, when the PGB trap density in the CH3NH3PbI3 photoactive layer exceeded 1 × 1013 cm−3, the conduction energy located at 1 μm, i.e. the PGB region, gradually decreased. The higher the trap density, the lower the conduction energy. It is well recognized that electrons can spontaneously move from higher energy to lower energy. Consequently, when there was no or a relatively low PGB trap density, generated electrons could effectively flow and be collected. However, when the PGB trap density exceeded a certain value (>1 × 1013 cm−3), disadvantageous electron injection from the grain bulk to the PGB region occurred, which led to carrier lateral transport and inferior carrier vertical collection, in good agreement with the above discussion.

Moreover, the transient photocurrent collection efficiency was probed for simulated PSCs with different PGB trap densities. When 1 ns transient illumination was applied, carriers were generated, thereby forming an available photocurrent. As shown in Fig. 8, regardless of the PGB trap density, an initial available photocurrent was invariant. Strangely, there was a disordered trend when the PGB trap density was specified as 1 × 1013 cm−3, which could not be illustrated. To detect the simulated collected current, a bias voltage was applied to the cathode (FTO) to avoid the influence of current caused by forward turn-on current. As shown in Fig. 8, when the PGB trap density was low (<1 × 1012 cm−3), the curves of the available photocurrent and cathode current almost coincided and a weaker high cathode current was caused by a reverse saturation current. However, the cathode current was apparently lower than the available photocurrent when a high GB trap density (>1 × 1014 cm−3) was specified, implying an inferior photo-generated carrier collection efficiency, consistent with the finding shown in Fig. 4b, resulting from excess carrier lateral transport. It was therefore justified to conclude that a large grain size was beneficial to producing high efficiency PSCs by reducing the PGB trap density and enhancing the carrier vertical collection efficiency.

In order to exclude the impact of other traps, such as interface recombination and grain bulk traps, on the lateral carrier transport behavior, we also analyzed the recombination rate distribution on account of grain bulk traps (shown in Fig. S7†). With regard to interface recombination, in all the simulation processes, this was always kept at an invariant value of 1 × 106 cm−3, which was a reasonable value. Likewise, the transient photocurrent collection efficiency versus the grain bulk trap density was also included in comparison to the PGB trap situation, and the result was shown in Fig. S8.† As shown in Fig. S7,† the recombination rate distribution always exhibited a Gaussian distribution, regardless of its trap density, although the situation varied as the bulk defects density increased. However, this situation was different from that with the PGB traps. To more clearly investigate their difference, Fig. 9 showed the spatial conduction band energy distribution across the lateral direction. It was clearly implied that there was no decrease in the conduction band energy within PSCs across the lateral direction.

Finally, we could safely conclude that a significant PGB trap density led to unfavorable lateral transport of photo-generated carriers, thereby leading to severe carrier accumulation. Motivated by previous progress, it was discovered that unfavorable charge accumulation is a key factor that leads to J–V hysteresis, due to the capacitive characteristics of PSCs. Thus, we considered that the high HI for PSCs possessing a certain perovskite grain size must also be closely related to a redundant PGB trap-state density, which might well be demonstrated in a subsequent report.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a facile and low cost method for fabricating dense CH3NH3PbI3 films with a controllable grain size ranging from 200 to 600 nm. Additionally, it is unveiled that different sized CH3NH3PbI3 grains can make a huge difference to the device performance, owing to these possessing different levels of PGB trap density, which primarily changes the electrical behavior of the carriers. Large CH3NH3PbI3 grains producing a low PGB trap density are necessary for efficient PSCs. Furthermore, to investigate the original role of the PGB trap, the recombination rate distribution, the lateral conduction band energy distribution, and the transient photocurrent collection efficiency within CH3NH3PbI3 films are also presented via device simulation, which consistently reveals the fact that, when the PGB trap density is high, serious lateral transport of carriers occurs, reducing the photo-generated carrier collection efficiency. In a word, this finding not only provides conclusive evidence for the influence of PGB traps, based on a physical model, but offers a predictive instruction for the future development of PSCs.
