    , Accepted 3rd December 2017First published on 4th December 2017AbstractLarge-grained perovskite layers with fewer defects are beneficial to minimize carrier recombination at grain boundaries, thus boosting cell performance. Here, we present a facile solvent exchange strategy (SES) to yield large-grained perovskite films with high reproducibility. Upon employing a stoichiometric PbI2:MAI:DMSO (3:2:2) precursor solution, we reduced the number of colloidal intermediates (PbI42−) which is correlated with the nucleation of seeds, resulting in a perovskite thin layer with large grain sizes up to 2 μm. The SES prepared CH3NH3PbI3 devices show significantly reduced grain boundaries corresponding to the decrease of recombination centers, which dramatically boosted the efficiency up to 17.2%.
Introduction
Within a span of few years, unparalleled progress has been made in the field of organolead triiodide perovskite cells (OTPCs), with the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) being increased from 3.8% to a recent 22.1%.1–5 Such a rapid performance improvement can be ascribed to the good properties of perovskite materials, including direct band gap, long carrier diffusion and high light absorption.6–8 Nonetheless, high-crystallization perovskite films with controlled morphology are essential for achieving high-performance OTPCs.9–11 Therefore, many approaches have been developed for yielding high-quality perovskite layers, e.g., two-step sequential deposition,5 additive-assisted deposition,12,13 solvent quenching,11,14,15 and gas-assisted deposition.10,16 Among these solution deposition methods, the sequential deposition reported by Burschka and co-workers has been widely used for fabricating mesoscopic OTPCs, in which a thin PbI2 layer is first coated and then reacted with MAI (MA = CH3NH3) solution.5 However, it is still a challenge to guarantee the efficient conversion of PbI2 in short-term dipping time. The residual PbI2 in the final perovskite films lead to uncontrollable crystal sizes, and thus has a negative effect on the reproducibility of devices. Zhao and co-workers introduced a facile sequential deposition to accelerate the formation of MAPbI3 during the second step by using the PbI2:xMAI (x: 0.1–0.3) precursor during the first step. The prepared pin-hole free MAPbI3 films are composed of 200–500 nm crystals.17 Meanwhile, the enhanced performance of perovskite films is determined by the crystal grain sizes. The grain boundaries between perovskite grains might induce the charge recombination due to the presence of charge traps.18–20 It is expected that the perovskite films composed of large grains may bring high performance including PCE. For example, Yu and co-workers reported that the annealed perovskite layer (dripping with diethyl ether) assisted with spin-coated MAI can effectively yield a large-grained perovskite film.18 Yang and co-workers demonstrated that the prepared MABr treated MAPbI3 thin films (washing with chlorobenzene) can convert into high-quality perovskite thin layers with a large grain size.20 These methods are used to prepare large grained perovskite layers by modifying MAPbI3 with excess MAX (X = I, Br). However, the iodide-rich perovskite tends to form ionic compound (MA)4PbI6, and thus the notorious low crystallinity.21
Herein, inspired by the studies mentioned above, a solvent exchange strategy (SES) was used to yield large-grained perovskite films without a dripping anti-solvent. By using a stoichiometric PbI2:MAI:DMSO (3:2:2) precursor solution, the obtained (MAI)2Pb3I8·(DMSO)2 intermediate phase (termed as Pb3I8) without any PbI2 residue during the first step leads to the complete transformation to MAPbI3 during the MAI intercalation step (the second of deposition). Moreover, compared with the conventional single-step solvent engineering process (CP), this novel SES method induced the formation of higher-quality perovskite thin films with large grain sizes up to 2 μm, greatly enhanced crystallinity and optical properties, thus significantly boosting PCE to 17.2%.
Experimental section
Solar cell fabrications
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (Pilkington, TEC15) was etched with Zn powder and HCl aqueous. The etched glass was then cleaned with detergent, distilled water, and ethanol. The blocking TiO2 layers (bl-TiO2) were deposited on the as-prepared FTO by means of spray pyrolysis followed by calcination at 510 °C for 30 min. The mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) film was deposited on cooling bl-TiO2 by spin-coating of the TiO2 paste (Dyesol 30NR-T) which was followed by heating at 510 °C for 20 min. During the single-step deposition process, the precursor solution (461 mg of PbI2, 159 mg of CH3NH3I, and 78 mg of DMSO in 600 mg of DMF) was spin-coated on the substrates at 4000 rpm for 25 s and 0.5 ml of diethyl ether was dripped on the substrate within 10 s before the surface changed to be turbid. For depositing the MAPbI3 perovskite layer with large grains, first a layer of Pb3I8 was spin-coated on the prepared mp-TiO2 layer from PbI2:MAI:DMSO precursor solution (461 mg of PbI2, 106 mg of CH3NH3I, and 78 mg of DMSO in 600 mg of DMF) at 3000 rpm for 20 s, then a 50 mg mL−1 of MAI in IPA solution was spin coated on the Pb3I8 film at 3000 rpm for 20 s immediately. The deposited perovskite film was heated at 105 °C for 30 min to obtain a dense film. Then, 35 μL of spiro-OMeTAD solution, which contained 73 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 28 μL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 17.5 μL of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg of Li-TSFI in 1 mL of acetonitrile) in 1 mL of CBZ, was spin-coated on the perovskite film at 3000 rpm for 20 s. Finally, a ∼60 nm gold electrode was deposited via thermal evaporation under vacuum at a constant evaporation rate of 0.6 nm s−1.
Characterization
The field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, FEI Sirion 200, Netherlands) was used to study the top-morphology of the prepared film. The crystal phase was obtained by X-ray diffraction (X'Pert Pro, Netherlands) using a Cu Kα beam (λ = 1.54 Å). The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) with a solar simulator (94043A, USA) equipped with a Keithley 2400 source meter. When measuring, a mask with 0.09 cm2 aperture area was used to avoid light scattering through the sides and to define the effective area of the device. Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and absorption spectroscopy were performed using the UV–vis spectrophotometer (SOLID3700, Shimadzu Co. Ltd, Japan). Incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were obtained with a spectral resolution of 5 nm, using a 300 W xenon lamp and a grating monochromator equipped with order sorting filters (Newport/Oriel). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were obtained on a computer controlled potentiostat (Autolab 320, Metrohm, Switzerland) in a frequency range of 10 mHz–1000 kHz applied in the dark. The micrographs were obtained during cooling between crossed polarizers using a microscope (DM2500P, Leica, Germany) equipped with a hot-stage (LTSE-420, Linkam, UK) and a camera (Micropublisher 5.0 RTV, Qimaging, Canada).
Results and discussion
The SES procedure for preparing large-grain perovskite layers is shown in Fig. 1a. First, the precursor solution containing PbI2, MAI, and DMSO (molar ratio 3:2:2) was spin-coated on the mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) layer at 3000 rpm for 20 s. The pre-deposited film was then loaded with MAI for 60 s to promote the SES reaction, followed by spinning at 3000 rpm for 20 s to remove the MAI containing IPA solution. Finally, the SES perovskite layers were obtained by heating at 105 °C for 10 min. Fig. 1b presents the device architecture and its cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image. This bi-layer architecture is effective at absorbing light and collecting charges. The highly dense perovskite film lies on the mp-TiO2; spiro-OMeTAD and Au were then deposited on the active layer acting as the hole-transporting material and photocathode, respectively. For this architecture, the dense thin perovskite layer with large grains is extremely important, and we developed our SES method for preparing such a layer.

Fig. 2a shows the surficial scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite films prepared by the CP method. As previously reported, the CP method produces a highly dense perovskite layer without pinholes due to retarding the reaction of PbI2 with MAI.15 The SEM images at higher magnification are supplied in Fig. S1,† it is clear that this dense film is composed of well-crystallized grains with sizes in the range of 50–150 nm. Although a uniform connected film is good for the cell performance, the original energy decreases due to non-radiative recombination at the undesirable grain boundaries.19,20 As shown in Fig. 2b, the SES method greatly enlarged the crystal size, which is close to 2 μm, thus greatly enhancing perovskite crystallinity. As is well-known, the average grain size is inversely proportional to the number of grain boundaries. Thus, it can be calculated that the density of grain boundaries in the perovskite layers with large grains is significantly minimized. Meanwhile, SES films are beneficial for prolonging carrier diffusion length and reducing trap density. In a word, the precursor solution containing PbI2, MAI, and DMSO (molar ratio 3:2:2) assisted with spin-coated MAI can control perovskite crystallinity via the minimization of grain boundaries. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectrum of perovskite films was obtained to further scrutinize the crystallinity of the prepared perovskite film. Both the layers prepared by CP and SES methods exhibited a perovskite tetragonal phase, including two notable peaks at 14.2° and 28.4° which correspond to (110) and (220), respectively. Furthermore, compared with the CP perovskite film, the XRD peak intensity of the SES perovskite film significantly increases by about three times, further indicating the enhanced crystallinity of the film (Fig. 2c) which agrees with the grain-morphology changes (Fig. 2a and b).3,20

A previous study has shown that the high quality perovskite film has a great influence on optical properties.22,23 The Ultraviolet–Visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) curves and time resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) spectroscopy for the two kinds of perovskite films were obtained. Both samples are prepared on glasses for avoiding the effects of charge injection between the FTO and active layer. As shown in Fig. 2d, the UV-Vis spectra show an un-conspicuous difference between the perovskite layers prepared by SES and CP methods. This was probably attributed to the full surface coverage of both kinds of films.23 Even so, it is interesting that PL intensities of the perovskite film prepared by the SES method significantly enhanced, indicating fewer surface defects and high crystallinity.24 TR-PL decay measurements (Fig. 2f) allowed us to estimate the information on charge recombination behavior in the perovskite films. The decay kinetics was measured at 770 nm for the prepared films upon excitation at 475 nm with 1.5 μJ cm−2 intensity to minimize non-linear annihilation processes as reported previously.25 The carrier lifetime of the perovskite film prepared by the CP method could be fitted with a bi-exponential decay function. The faster lifetime component (1.2 ns) could be considered to be nonradiative recombination of electrons and holes through trap states in perovskite layers and the slower lifetime component (3.7 ns) could be attributed to the recombination of free electrons and holes in perovskite films. Notably, the SES perovskite film exhibits nearly single exponential decay with a lifetime of 4.2 ns. This result indicated that the SES perovskite film with less grain boundary decreased the charge recombination process and thus increased the carrier lifetime.26,27
To understand the mechanism for the large grain perovskite film crystallization process, we performed in situ optical micrograph measurements during thermal annealing. The images of SES films at different stages of crystallization are shown in Fig. 3a–c. Immediately after the SES precursor solution was spin-coated on the substrate, we observed the transparent film in the optical image changed to blue color (Fig. 3a). The XRD pattern of the transparent precursor phase is shown in Fig. 3e, implying the formation of the Pb3I8 intermediate phase, which was consistent with previous reports.28,29 The equimolar MAI should be introduced to react with the Pb3I8 phase for achieving the targeted perovskite compound. As expected, the introduced MAI leads to several gray flower-like shaped nuclei which we assume to be iodide-rich nucleations (Fig. 3b). As time went on, these gray nuclei grow dark, becoming perovskite crystals (Fig. 3c). Based on the above observations, the mechanism for the formation of the perovskite layer with large grain fabricated through a solvent exchange approach is illustrated in Fig. 3d. At the initial stage, the composition of the film has been proved to be the Pb3I8 intermediate phase and upon annealing it results in the MAPbI3 tetragonal perovskite phase. As expected from the transformation of the intermediate phase to MAPbI3, two DMSO molecules in Pb3I8 can be easily exchanged by introduced MAI. Finally, the pre-deposited Pb3I8 layers could be directly converted to the MAPbI3 film via solvent exchange.28 The intramolecular exchange between DMSO and Pb3I8 can be described as: (1)

Previous reports have uncovered that perovskite grain size is strongly correlated with the number of nuclei on the surface.19,30 During crystal growth, the nuclei will spontaneously grow before they touch surrounding crystals at grain boundaries. Thus, the average size of MAPbI3 crystals decreased with increasing number of nuclei. We take the 250 μM precursor solution (PbI2, CP and SES) and characterize it with UV–Vis measurements to compare the PbI42− complex phase which is correlated with the nucleation of seeds (Fig. 3f).31 The UV–Vis spectra show that CP solution has higher concentration of PbI42− than the SES precursor, suggesting that the SES perovskite film has a larger grain size. The colloidal intermediates (PbI42+) are also proven to induce defects, and therefore increase the density of charge recombination centers.32 The results agreed well with the TRPL decay curves (Fig. 2e).
As mentioned above, the SES method has been proved to be an effective approach to yield the perovskite film with large grains, and therefore enhance the solar cell photoelectric performance. Fig. 4a shows the typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OTPCs, and the corresponding detailed photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. As a result of large size grains, the OTPC prepared by the SES method exhibited higher short-circuit current density (JSC). The corresponding JSC were verified by the internal photo-current efficiency spectrum (IPCE) measurement in Fig. 4b. The calculated integrated current density was quite consistent with the JSC in the J–V curves (Fig. 4a). The SES perovskite device has a much larger open-circuit voltage (VOC) due to reduced recombination in the device.3 We measured recombination resistance to study the charge recombination between the light absorption layer (MAPbI3) and electron transporting layer (TiO2). As shown in Fig. 4c, the recombination resistance (Rrec) can be valued by fitting the Nyquist plots with a simulated equivalent circuit (in the inset). The Rrec of the device prepared by the SES method is obviously larger than that of the CP one, indicating a decreased recombination at the perovskite/TiO2 interface.24

The best SES device exhibited a Jsc of 21.9 mA cm−2, aVoc of 1.05 eV, FF of 75.1% and PCE of 17.2% with a negligible hysteresis of the J–V curves (Fig. 4e). In addition, the steady state output of a typical solar cell was determined to evaluate the stabilized power output of the devices. As shown in Fig. 4d, the stabilized photocurrent density (J) and PCE can remain within 300 s at a bias of 0.84 V. Fig. 4f exhibits the statistic PCE of the as-prepared 30 devices prepared by the CP and SES method, respectively. The OTPCs prepared by the SES method showed a narrower PCE distribution than the OTPCs prepared by the CP method. These results suggest this work gives the possibility of reproducible perovskite devices prepared by the SES method.
Conclusions
In summary, using stoichiometric PbI2:MAI:DMSO (3:2:2) precursor solution followed by reacting with MAI can effectively yield perovskite films with large grains via solvent exchange. The SES prepared large-grained perovskite devices reduced the charge recombination at grain boundaries, which improves the PCE to 17.2%. The proposed approach will have great potential to optimize the perovskite film quality for achieving high-efficiency perovskite devices.
