    , Accepted 22nd January 2019First published on 23rd January 2019AbstractThe performance of p–i–n planar perovskite solar cells (PSCs) strongly depends on the electronic structure and interfacial properties of hole transporting materials (HTMs). Four diphenylamine derivatives with a fluorene core were synthesized and employed as hole transport layers in inverted p–i–n planar PSCs. HTMs that are endowed with vinyl crosslinking units can form insoluble 3D networks under mild annealing temperature, which improve the solvent resistance during the device fabrication and morphological stability. Moreover, the optimized devices incorporating crosslinked HTMs exhibit an impressive power conversion efficiency of 18.7% with a high Jsc of 20.89 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.15 V and FF of 77.8%, which are superior to those of PEDOT:PSS based PSCs. The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurement justifies that the new HTMs feature deep HOMO levels aligning well with the perovskite. Moreover, the hydrophobic nature of the synthesized HTMs favors the formation of large grained and continuous perovskite films with good surface coverage, evidenced by the water contact angles and film morphology measurements. Steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence studies also reveal that fast charge transfer and suppressed recombination occur between the perovskite and HTMs. Our studies demonstrate that employing crosslinked organic HTMs is a promising approach to achieve high efficiency and stable PSCs.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic/inorganic perovskites have attracted great attention as a promising candidate for the next generation of photovoltaic technologies, owing to their high absorption coefficient, long diffusion length, bipolar charge transport, tunable bandgap and low-cost solution processability. To date, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has exceeded 22%.1 Enormous research efforts have been dedicated to optimizing the crystallinity, morphology and surface coverage of light absorbing perovskite layers. Besides, interfacial layers, especially hole transport layers (HTLs), are an essential component in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) because they play critical roles in charge transport, charge extraction and recombination, and thus determine the efficiency, stability and fabrication cost of PSCs.2–4
A variety of p-type materials, including small organic molecules, inorganic materials (NiOx, CuI, CuSCN etc.) and polymeric materials, have been adopted as HTMs in both mesoporous and planar structured PSCs.5–8 Among reported HTMs, small molecule 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) is the best performing HTM for mesoporous and n–i–p planar PSCs.9 However, Spiro-OMeTAD needs addition of ionic dopants to achieve high hole carrier mobility. Ionic doping causes serious ion migration in the device, leading to electrical hysteresis and degradation. Additionally, high synthesis cost of Spiro-OMeTAD hinders its practical application for low cost and large-scale PSCs. Transparent metal oxides have been well explored as HTMs, owing to their high optical transparency, good electric conductivity, and suitable energy alignment with the perovskite. A typical example NiOx prepared by a sol–gel method usually requires a high annealing temperature over 400 °C, which makes it not compatible with low-temperature processing.5,7 Recently, Choy et al. synthesized NiOx nanocrystals and achieved high performance flexible perovskite solar cells with a low temperature solution process.10,11 Because of their low temperature solution processing, organic polymers such as poly(styrene sulfonic) acid (PEDOT:PSS) have been extensively used in organic solar cells and commonly used in inverted p–i–n planar PSCs. Although PEDOT:PSS exhibits a high conductivity and high work function of 4.87 eV, the poor electron blocking capability of PEDOT:PSS limits the device efficiency. Additionally, the acidic nature of PEDOT:PSS chemically etches the ITO substrate, and water processed PEDOT:PSS inevitably increases the water content in the devices, resulting in a decrease of the device stability. In general, ideal HTMs for PSCs should meet several requirements. First, HTMs should possess a favorable electronic structure to form an ohmic contact with the anode for efficient hole extraction, high conductivity for hole transport without extra doping,12 and effective electron blocking capabilities to prevent charge recombination. Second, HTMs require good film forming properties ensuring uniform coverage and desired interfacial properties optimizing the crystallization and morphology of the above perovskite layer, which is particularly important for p–i–n type PSCs. Third, HTMs should be compatible with low temperature processes, and possess good solvent resistance to the subsequent solution process of perovskite layers. So far, there are no existing HTMs that meet all the above requirements for PSCs. To advance PSCs toward successful commercialization, it is highly urgent to develop better HTMs combining good electronic properties, interfacial properties and environmental stability.13,14
Arylamine derivatives such as triarylamine and diphenylamine units are important building blocks for HTMs in organic light-emitting diodes, organic photovoltaics and dye sensitized solar cells, owing to their low ionization potential and hole mobility.15,16 The derivatives such as poly-[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) and poly[N,N′-bis(4-butylphenyl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)benzidine] (Poly-TPD) have been successfully explored for planar PSCs with a reported PCE of 18.3% and 15.3%, respectively.17,18 On the other hand, stacking multilayers with a solution process is very challenging because pre-deposited layers might be partially dissolved or etched during the consecutive fabrication steps. The most common solution is to use an orthogonal solvent. Alternatively, grafting crosslinkable units such as bromine, vinyl, acrylate and azide groups onto organic HTMs can form an insoluble 3D network after thermal or UV treatment, and thereby enhance the device stability.19–21 More recently, UV crosslinked N4,N40-bis(4-(6-((3-ethyloxetan-3-yl)methoxy)hexyl)phenyl)-N4,N40-diphenylbiphenyl-4,40-diamine (OTPD) and (vinylbenzyl)9,9-diaryfluorene-based triaryldiamine (VB-DAAF) have been explored as HTMs for planar PSCs, and exhibit an excellent PCE of 15.1% and 15.17%, respectively.22,23
In this work, a series of diphenylamine derivatives, 2,7-di-(N,N-di-methoxyphenylamino)-9H-fluorene (MeO-FDPA), 2,7-di-(N,N-di-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9-bis-(hex-5-enyl)-9H fluorene (DH-MeO-FDPA), 2,7-di-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9-bis-(4-vinyl-benzyl)-9H-fluorene (VB-MeO-FDPA), and 2,7-di-(N,N-di-p-tolylamino)-9,9-bis-(4-vinyl-benzyl)-9H-fluorene (VB-Me-FDPA), have been synthesized and investigated as the HTMs for p–i–n planar PSCs. New HTMs can replace commonly used PEDOT:PSS to be directly deposited on top of ITO, or can be incorporated with PEDOT:PSS to form a bilayer PEDOT:PSS/HTL structure. HTMs containing a vinyl cross-linking agent not only remarkably enhance the solvent resistance to the following solution process but also significantly improve the device efficiency and stability. We systematically investigate the relationship between different molecular structures of HTMs with their roles in the PSCs by comparing our synthesized HTMs. Specifically, VB-MeO-FDPA with aromatic side chain and methoxy substitution exhibits a remarkable PCE of 18.7%, negligible electrical hysteresis and excellent stability for MAPbI3−xClx PSCs, and is among the best dopant-free and crosslinked HTMs for inverted planar PSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and chemicals
Lead iodide (PbI2, ≥99.99%), methyl ammonium iodide (MAI, 99.5%), lead chloride (PbCl2, ≥99.99%), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS, Al 4083) and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, 99.5%) were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp., and used without any purification. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, ≥99.9%), γ-butyrolactone (GBL, ≥99%), chloroform (CHCl3, ≥99.8%), methanol (MeOH, 99.8%) and chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8%) used in the experiments were anhydrous reagents and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Polyethyleneimine (PEI) (Mw = 25k, Mn = 10k) was also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. MeO-FDPA, VB-MeO-FDPA and VB-Me-FDPA are synthesized by following the method described in previous reports.24,25 Besides, DH-MeO-FDPA can be synthesized from 2,7-dibromo-9,9-di(hex-5-en-1-yl)-9H-fluorene.26 More synthesis details can be found in the ESI.†
2.2 Device fabrication
Patterned ITO substrates were cleaned using an ultrasonic bath in detergent water followed by sequential washing with acetone and alcohol for 30 min. After drying, the cleaned ITO substrates were treated with oxygen plasma before spin coating HTMs. PEDOT:PSS was spin coated at 4000 rpm for 60 s and dried on a hot plate at 150 °C for 15 min. Four synthesized HTMs were spin coated at a speed of 3000 rpm for 60 s, and then these HTM coated substrates were crosslinked at different temperatures from 100 °C to 200 °C for 20 min. Perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving PbI2, PbCl2 and MAI with a molar ratio of 1.25:0.15:1.4 in a mixture of DMSO/GBL (v/v = 3:7) solution. Subsequently, the precursor solution was spin coated on the different hole transport layers with a spin speed of 1000 rpm for 10 s, and 4000 rpm for another 30 s. During the second step, 400 μl CB was dripped on the samples as an antisolvent. The perovskite films were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min. Then, the solution of PCBM (25 mg ml−1 in CB) was spin coated on top of the perovskite film at 3000 rpm for 60 s followed by spin coating the PEI modification layer at 5000 rpm for 30 s from isopropanol solution (0.05 wt%). Finally, 80 nm thick silver was thermally evaporated as the top contact at an evaporation rate of 0.2 Å s−1.
2.3 Characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were measured under illumination of an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5) solar simulator (Enli Technology Co., Ltd.) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The device area was measured to be 0.045 cm2. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were carried out under ambient conditions using an EQE system (Enli Technology Co., Ltd.). SEM images of the perovskite films were obtained by using a Nova NanoSEM 450 at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. The PL spectrum and lifetime measurements of the perovskite films were conducted on Edinburgh fluorescence spectrometers (FLSP920).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 presents the molecular structure of the four home-synthesized HTMs. The detailed synthetic procedures and characterization are given in the ESI.† The MeO-FDPA HTM consists of a fluorene core between two bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amine DPA units. Based on MeO-FDPA, we introduce different crosslinkable side chains on the fluorene core and vary the substituents on the diphenylamine groups, which tends to modify the energy levels, charge mobilities and surface properties of HTMs. Crosslinkable alkyl side chains (6-hexenyl group) were introduced into the coplanar fluorene core in DH-MeO-FDPA. Similarly, aromatic side groups (4-ethylene-benzyl) were attached to the fluorene core to obtain VB-MeO-FDPA. To compare the substitution effects, we also designed VB-Me-FDPA by replacing methoxy (MeO) with methyl (Me) groups. Note that DH-MeO-FDPA, VB-MeO-FDPA and VB-Me-FDPA all contain vinyl based crosslinking units. Under mild thermal treatment conditions, a crosslinking reaction proceeds due to the polymerization of vinyl groups. Finally, an insoluble three-dimensional polymeric network is formed via covalent bonds. It should be noted that this crosslinking process does not require any use of initiators or dopants, and consequently avoids introducing unexpected impurities and defects that are detrimental to the device efficiency and stability.

Fig. 2a illustrates the energy level diagrams of p–i–n planar PSCs with different HTMs with the typical p–i–n configuration of ITO/HTMs/MAPbI3−xClx/PCBM/PEI/Ag. A PEI modifier was used to facilitate the electron extraction to the cathode. Tested HTMs include the reference PEDOT:PSS and four home-synthesized HTMs. All crosslinkable HTMs were treated at the same crosslinking temperature of 160 °C for 20 minutes to ensure complete crosslinking. Representative current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs with different HTMs are shown in Fig. 2b and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The PEDOT:PSS control device showed a PCE of 13.7% with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.55 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.03 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 75.6%, which are comparable to those in a previous report.27 Replacing PEDOT:PSS with the synthesized HTMs significantly increased the Jsc and Voc, resulting in enhanced device efficiency. In particular, the devices consisting of VB-MeO-FDPA as the HTL exhibited the highest PCE of 18.7% with a Jsc of 20.89 mA cm−2, FF of 77.8%, and Voc of 1.15 V. As shown in Fig. 2c, champion VB-MeO-FDPA based PSCs displayed a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of over 80% ranging from 400 to 750 nm. The Jsc integrated from the overlap of EQE and AM 1.5G illumination was close to the values determined from the J–V scans (within 5% deviation), confirming the accuracy of our high device efficiency. Moreover, we compared the J–V curves of crosslinked VB-MeO-FDPA based PSCs with those of PEDOT:PSS based devices in the forward and reverse scan directions as shown in Fig. 2d. The PEDOT:PSS based PSCs showed noticeable J–V hysteresis which might be due to the ionic migration to the grain boundaries and film interfaces. In contrast, the optimum devices with crosslinked VB-MeO-FDPA as the HTL showed negligible photocurrent hysteresis. We attribute the absence of hysteresis to mitigated ion migration, and enhanced interfacial charge transfer at HTMs/perovskite interfaces.28 Clearly, our crosslinked HTMs can effectively improve the device efficiency together with reducing the electrical hysteresis. In Fig. S1,† we also compared the stability of perovskite devices using crosslinked VB-MeO-FDPA and reference PEDOT:PSS HTMs. The unencapsulated devices were continuously illuminated under one sun conditions in a N2 box. The PCE of the PEDOT:PSS based reference device degraded to 46% of its initial value after 200 hours of light soaking. In contrast, the devices with crosslinked VB-MeO-FDPA still retained 85% of their original efficiency, suggesting the excellent long-term stability of crosslinked HTMs.

In order to illustrate the origins of the improved device performance, we first examined the electronic structures of the synthesized HTMs. It is well known that interfacial energy level alignment essentially determines how efficiently the photogenerated charge carriers can be extracted from the photoactive perovskite layer before charge carriers experience any recombination. The HOMO energy levels of the four HTMs were measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Fig. 3a shows the onset (Eon) and cutoff energy (Ecutoff) regions in the UPS spectrum for the four synthesized HTMs. Based on the equation: EHOMO = 21.2 − (Ecutoff − Eon), the HOMO of MeO-FDPA was calculated to be −5.08 eV, which is higher than that of PEDOT:PSS (−4.87 eV). Attaching a long alkyl group and aromatic group to the fluorene core modulates the electronic structure of molecules to different extents. Similarly, the HOMO levels of DH-MeO-FDPA and VB-MeO-FDPA were measured to be −5.04 eV and −5.18 eV, respectively, suggesting that aromatic side chain (vinyl-benzyl) substitution is more effective in tuning HOMO levels downward than alkyl side chain (hexenyl) substitution does. As revealed in Fig. 3a, the deep HOMO levels of the four synthesized HTMs are cascaded between the ITO and the MAPbI3−xClx perovskite. This cascade energy structure overcomes the energy offset at the interfaces, and thereby facilitates the hole extraction and mitigates surface recombination. As a result, we observed a higher Voc in line with the measured deeper HOMO levels of HTMs. In addition, we compared substitution effects of methoxy and methyl groups on DPA units. After replacing methoxy groups with methyl groups, the HOMO energy of VB-Me-FDPA was further lowered by about 0.02 eV. Correspondingly, we observed a slightly larger Voc from VB-MeO-FDPA based PSCs as compared to the VB-Me-FDPA based PSCs. The deeper HOMO of VB-Me-FDPA can be partially ascribed to the stronger electron withdrawing capability of methyl groups in comparison with their methoxy analogues. Fig. 3b presents the absorption spectra of the four synthesized HTMs. The absorption range of the four HTMs is below 450 nm, indicating that they have minimal competition with the perovskite absorber. The optical bandgap was extracted from the optical absorption edge of UV-absorption spectra. Then, the LUMO energy levels were obtained by subtracting the optical bandgap from the HOMO. Subsequently, the measured LUMO levels of the four HTMs range from −2.56 to −2.91 eV. Compared with the conduction band (−3.75 eV) of MAPbI3−xClx, the high lying LUMO of the synthesized HTMs can provide good electron blocking capability in PSCs. Therefore, it is believed that the four synthesized HTMs can efficiently extract holes and block the electrons.

Apart from the favorable energy level alignment, the charge mobility is another key parameter of HTMs. Fig. S2† presents the J–V curves of hole-only devices with the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTMs/perovskite/MoO3/Ag. The hole mobilities were extracted with the space charge limited current measurement (SCLC) method. The calculated hole mobility of MeO-FDPA, DH-MeO-FDPA, VB-MeO-FDPA and VB-Me-FDPA was 2.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 5.0 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, 3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Non-crosslinked MeO-FDPA shows relatively lower hole mobility, which is possibly due to its poor film forming ability. In addition, the hole transport layer could be partially destroyed during the fabrication of the active layer by the used solvent which is another main drawback of non-crosslinked MeO-FDPA. Consequently, a low FF of the MeO-FDPA based device was observed. However, the hole mobility of VB-MeO-FDPA and VB-Me-FDPA is almost one order of magnitude higher than that of MeO-FDPA and DH-MeO-FDPA. The high mobility of 3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 of non-doped VB-MeO-FDPA is comparable with that of doped spiro-OMeTAD (1.6 × 10−4 to 1.6 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1),29 and among those of the best non-doped polymeric HTMs.12 Thus, our results indicate that introducing crosslinked aromatic side chains into the fluorene core not only promotes the intermolecular π–π interaction and enhances charge transport, but also can enhance the solvent resistance of the hole transport layer. Due to the improved charge mobility and stability, the PSCs with VB-MeO-FDPA and VB-Me-FDPA crosslinked HTLs exhibit a higher Jsc and FF.
It is known that the efficiency of PSCs strongly depends on the perovskite film morphology. Modifying the surface energies of HTMs substantially changes the nucleation and growth process of perovskite crystals, and heavily influences the film morphology. In general, the hydrophilic surface of HTMs such as PEDOT:PSS tends to obtain perovskite crystals with a small grain size. In contrast, it was previously found that the hydrophobic surface of HTMs such as PTAA favors the formation of large perovskite crystals by preventing the formation of an overly dense nucleus.17 The large grain size of the perovskite with fewer grain boundaries is vital to achieving highly efficient PSCs. On the other hand, distinct surface energies between the hydrophobic HTMs and hygroscopic perovskite precursors result in poor surface coverage with numerous pinholes, resulting in leakage current and a low FF in PSCs. Consequently, the trade-off between the large grain size and full surface coverage of perovskite films should be balanced in designing HTMs for p–i–n PSCs. We further investigated the impact of different HTMs on the crystallization of the above perovskite films. First, we performed the water contact angle measurement to examine the surface properties of HTMs. As shown in Fig. S3,† the contact angles of water on the four HTMs were 85°, 89°, 94° and 121° for MeO-FDPA, DH-MeO-FDPA, VB-MeO-FDPA and VB-Me-FDPA respectively, which are larger contact angles than that of PEDOT:PSS (7.9°) and spiro-OMeTAD (76.1°).13,30 This result confirms the hydrophobic nature of the synthesized HTMs. Consequently, the hydrophobic HTMs would prevent ambient moisture ingression, which directly improved the device stability as shown in Fig. S1.† We also note that directly spin coating perovskite precursor solution on top of VB-Me-FDPA, which exhibits the strongest hydrophobicity, was challenging to obtain fully covered perovskite films. To address this issue, we spin coated polar GBL solvent on top of VB-Me-FDPA before depositing perovskite precursor solution. After solvent treatment, we were able to achieve continuous perovskite films. Thanks to the good solvent resistance of crosslinked HTMs, the film morphology of crosslinked HTMs was not deteriorated by the solvent treatment and follow-on layer spin coating process, which can be checked by using an optical microscope. The impact of various HTMs on the grain nucleation and crystal growth of perovskites was verified by the SEM images of MAPbI3−xClx films. As shown in Fig. 4, all perovskite films presented uniform morphologies with full surface coverage, indicating the advantage of crosslinked HTMs in forming compact and smooth films. The statistical histograms of the perovskite grain sizes on different HTMs are analyzed in Fig. S4.† The average grain size of MAPbI3−xClx is 206 nm on PEDOT:PSS, 190 nm on MeO-FDPA, 222 nm on DH-MeO-FDPA, 240 nm on VB-MeO-FDPA, and 171 nm on VB-Me-FDPA. Among them, the MAPbI3−xClx polycrystalline films deposited on VB-MeO-FDPA feature the largest grain size of 240 nm, which is in good agreement with its highest PCE. The large grain size of perovskite crystals with fewer ground boundaries essentially reduces the trap densities and suppresses charge recombination in PSCs, leading to increased Jsc and Voc.

To compare the charge transfer dynamics at the perovskite/HTM interfaces, we measured the steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) characteristics of perovskite films on different HTMs as shown in Fig. 5a and b. The PL of the perovskite films deposited on various HTL substrates exhibited the same emission peak at 761 nm. Instead, we observed PL quenching of the perovskite to different extents as perovskite films were coated on different HTMs. The PL intensity was slightly reduced to 62% of its original intensity for the PEDOT:PSS/MAPbI3−xClx sample. In contrast, the PL intensity of MeO-FDPA, DH-MeO-FDPA, VB-MeO-FDPA and VB-Me-FDPA/MAPbI3−xClx samples was quenched to 47%, 20%, 6%, and 12% of that of pure perovskite films. Clearly, the strongest PL quenching of VB-MeO-FDPA/MAPbI3−xClx indicates that the most sufficient charge transfer occurs from the perovskite to crosslinked HTMs. Fig. 5b illustrates the time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay curves of the perovskite on different HTMs monitored at 760 nm. The PL decay curves can be well fitted with a bi-exponential equation: y = y0 + A1e(−(x−x0)/τ1) + A2e(−(x−x0)/τ2)(1)where A1 and A2 are the fractions of two decay components, and τ1 and τ2 are the lifetimes responsible for the fast and slow recombination, respectively. The fitted τ1and τ2 are listed in Table S1.† As compared to the PEDOT:PSS/perovskite film, the lifetime of the perovskite film deposited on the crosslinked HTMs was significantly reduced. Especially, the PL lifetimes τ1 and τ2 of VB-MeO-FDPA/MAPbI3−xClx are reduced to 5 ns and 13 ns. This result confirms that the hole transfer is sufficient from the perovskite to crosslinked VB-MeO-FDPA. Combining the above morphological and charge transfer studies, photogenerated charge carriers can be efficiently extracted to the electrode without recombination at perovskite crystal grain boundaries or at electrode interfaces, resulting in increased Jsc.

The thermal crosslinking temperature severely impacts the crosslinking reaction process of HTMs, and also influences the film quality of HTMs. In order to determine optimum crosslinking temperature, Fig. 6a displays the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of PSCs incorporating the best-performing VB-MeO-FDPA HTMs at different crosslinking temperatures. The photovoltaic performance is summarized in Table S2.† At low cross-linking temperature, we observed the “S” shape of J–V curves, implying a non-ohmic contact at either the HTMs/perovskite interface or the HTMs/ITO interface. We speculate that incomplete crosslinking of HTMs may generate a non-compact transport layer, resulting in the direct contact of the perovskite with the ITO substrate. As the crosslinking temperature increased, the S shape gradually disappeared, indicating the removal of energy barriers at interfaces. At an optimum crosslinking temperature of 160 °C, the PSCs achieved the best PCE of 18.7%. The optimum crosslinking temperature is much lower than the thermal annealing temperature for metal oxide based HTMs, and fully compatible with low temperature processing of flexible devices. Further increasing the crosslinking temperature up to 200 °C leads to the decrease of PCE, which might be due to serious dewetting of HTMs at the higher thermal annealing temperature. Thus, tuning the crosslinking temperature appears as an effective approach to adjust the surface properties of HTMs and consequently optimize the above perovskite morphology. The thickness of crosslinked HTMs is also critical to the device performance. Fig. S5† presents the thickness dependence of the crosslinked VB-MeO-FDPA HTM on the device performance. The optimal thickness of the crosslinked HTMs was around 10 nm.

Besides replacing PEDOT:PSS with crosslinked HTMs, we also attempted to spin coat the best-performing VB-MeO-FDPA on top of PEDOT:PSS to build a bilayer PEDOT:PSS/VB-MeO-FDPA HTL. This bilayer HTL is able to adjust the work function and modify the surface wetting properties to improve the device performance. As shown in Fig. 6b, the PSCs with a bilayer HTL structure exhibited a higher Jsc of 19.6 mA cm−2, a remarkably high FF of 76.5% and a PCE of 15.6%, and also outperformed the PEDOT:PSS control devices. The morphology of the perovskite film on top of the PEDOT:PSS/VB-MeO-FDPA double layer film is presented in Fig. S6.† More compact perovskite films with a larger grain size were found on top of crosslinked VB-MeO-FDPA. These morphological results are in good agreement with the improved device performance.
In conclusion, we have synthesized a series of diphenylamine fluorene derivatives with different substituents that can be thermally crosslinked at a mild temperature of 160 °C. These crosslinked HTMs can replace the commonly used PEDOT:PSS or form a PEDOT:PSS/HTM bilayer structure in p–i–n planar PSCs. Incorporating crosslinked HTMs significantly enhanced the PSC efficiency, eliminated the electrical hysteresis and improved the device stability. Compared to the PEDOT:PSS based reference PSCs with an efficiency of 13.7%, the best performing PSCs with crosslinked VB-MeO-FDPA achieved an impressive PCE of 18.7% with negligible hysteresis, and the device with double layer PEDOT:PSS/crosslinked VB-MeO-FDPA also obtained an enhanced PCE of 15.6%. The enhanced device efficiency can be ascribed to the better energy alignment of VB-MeO-FDPA with the perovskite and the high conductivity of crosslinked VB-MeO-FDPA, which sufficiently facilitate the charge transfer and charge extraction from the perovskite to the electrode. Moreover, the hydrophobic HTMs favor the growth of high quality perovskite films with a large grain size, which subsequently suppress the recombination at grain boundaries. Finally, the crosslinked HTMs also demonstrate excellent solvent resistance during the follow-on solution process, which is vital to the device stability. As a result, our results highlight the great potential of crosslinkable HTMs as a new group of HTMs to achieve highly efficient, low cost and stable PSCs.
