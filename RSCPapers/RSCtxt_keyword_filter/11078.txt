    , Accepted 30th January 2017First published on 14th February 2017AbstractThe copper(I) complexes [Cu(1)2][PF6], [Cu(2)2][PF6], [Cu(3)2][PF6] and [Cu(4)2][PF6] (1 = 2-(1H-imidazol-2-yl)-6-methylpyridine, 2 = 2-(6-methylpyridin-2-yl)oxazole, 3 = 2-(6-methylpyridin-2-yl)thiazole and 4 = 2-methyl-6-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)pyridine) are reported. The crystal structures of [Cu(2)2][PF6]·0.5CH2Cl2 and [Cu(3)2][PF6] confirm N,N′-chelation modes for 2 and 3, and tetrahedral copper(I). In the solution absorption spectra, the MLCT band shifts to lower energy with a change in heteroatom (O, 424 nm; NH, 435 nm; NMe, 446 nm; S, 465 nm). [Cu(1)2][PF6] and [Cu(4)2][PF6] undergo copper-centred oxidative processes at lower potential than the complexes with O or S heteroatoms. Heteroleptic complexes [Cu(5)(L)]+ (5 = ((6,6′-dimethyl-[2,2′-bipyridine]-4,4′-diyl)bis(4,1-phenylene)bis(phosphonic acid)), L = 1–4) were assembled on FTO/TiO2 electrodes. The shift in the MLCT band (O ∼ NH < NMe < S) in the solid-state absorption spectra of the dye-functionalized electrodes parallels that of solution. The photoconversion efficiencies (η) of masked, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) containing [Cu(5)(L)]+ (L = 1–4) dyes and an I−/I3− redox shuttle follow the order [Cu(5)(1)]+ (3.03%) > [Cu(5)(3)]+ (2.88%) > [Cu(5)(4)]+ (2.71%) > [Cu(5)(2)]+ (2.62%) relative to 7.55% for N719. Ancillary ligand 1 (with NH) leads to the highest open-circuit voltage (VOC = 608 mV) whilst 3 (S-heteroatom) gives the highest short-circuit current density (JSC = 7.76 mA cm−2). The performances of [Cu(5)(1)]+ and [Cu(5)(3)]+ are understood with the aid of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The DSC with [Cu(5)(1)]+ exhibits a high chemical capacitance (Cμ) and a low recombination resistance (Rrec); since the latter is offset by a low transport resistance (Rtr), a high JSC and VOC are observed for [Cu(5)(1)]+. DSCs with [Cu(5)(3)]+ have the lowest Rtr of all four devices. The performance of DSCs sensitized by a combination of [Cu(5)(1)]+ and [Cu(5)(3)]+ were assessed in order to capitalize upon the high VOC of [Cu(5)(1)]+ and the high JSC of [Cu(5)(3)]+. After FTO/TiO2 functionalization with anchor 5, the electrodes were treated with a 1:1 mix of [Cu(5)(1)]+ and [Cu(5)(3)]+ or sequentially with [Cu(5)(3)]+ then [Cu(5)(1)]+, or [Cu(5)(1)]+ then [Cu(5)(3)]+. The DSC performances and the EIS parameters are consistent with competition between 1 and 3 for surface binding-sites; 1 dominates over 3, both in binding and in contribution to the overall photoresponse.
Introduction
The Grätzel n-type dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC)1–3 converts solar photons into electrical energy. Conversion efficiencies of ∼11–14% have been attained with state-of-the-art ruthenium-based, organic or zinc(II) porphyrin-based sensitizers.4–16 Key factors in the development of DSCs are the improved design of ‘push–pull’ dyes, tuning of redox couples and compositions of liquid electrolytes, and the use of co-adsorbents and co-sensitizers. The fabrication of both the working and counter electrodes is also of crucial importance.17 Ideally, a sensitizer in a DSC should be panchromatic, but in practice, many dyes have a limited absorption range. To overcome this, a second dye can be absorbed on the semiconductor surface to enhance the absorption spectrum in the regions where the first dye has only low spectral response. Further advantages of co-sensitization are a reduction in charge recombination, extended electron lifetime and a decrease in the total resistance of the DSC.18 Because of their readily tuned and large absorption maxima, organic dyes are often the co-sensitizers of choice to complement ruthenium-based dyes;19 intensely absorbing near-infrared dyes20 and dyes that absorb between 300 and 500 nm21 have attracted particular attention. Co-sensitization using zinc(II) porphyrins and organic dyes has led to notable enhancements of DSC performances,22,23 and has enabled one of the highest power conversion efficiencies, η, of 12.3%.24 Fan et al.23 demonstrated that stepwise co-sensitization of a TiO2 electrode with zinc(II) porphyrin-based and organic dyes rather than immersion of the electrode in a solution containing a mixture of these dyes led to improved DSC performance; sequential surface treatment with the zinc(II) porphyrin dye followed by organic sensitizer leads to better DSC performance than the opposite order.23 Efficient panchromatic performance has also been achieved with a combination of a zinc(II) carboxyphthalocyanine and an organic co-sensitizer, although co-sensitization with phthalocyanines does not routinely enhance DSC performance.25 Co-sensitization using complementary organic dyes has received significant attention;26 the combined effects of broadened absorption ranges (with respect to a single dye) leading to higher short-circuit current density (JSC), and reduced charge recombination giving improved open-circuit voltages (VOC) result in considerably enhanced photoconversion efficiencies.
Of particular relevance to our present investigation is co-sensitization using complementary inorganic dyes. Ranasinghe et al.27 have investigated the co-sensitization with N719 and the ruthenium ‘black dye’ in solid-state DSCs, and demonstrated that the combination with the black dye increases light-harvesting close to 500 nm with respect to surfaces sensitized with N719 alone. Functionalization by dipping in a 1:1 cocktail of the two dyes improves both JSC and VOC, with increases in η from 3.8 or 3.0%, respectively, for N719 and the black dye individually, to 4.6% for the melange. It is proposed that the N719 helps to prevent aggregation of black dye on the TiO2 surface.
Our interests in developing dyes for DSCs based on sustainable components focus on copper(I)-containing photosensitizers.28 Within a relatively short timeframe, this area has witnessed milestone achievements, with photoconversion efficiencies reaching 4.66%.28–30 Although strategic dye design predicates a ‘push–pull’ arrangement of ancillary (Lancillary) and anchoring ligands (Lanchor), we have found that simple ancillary ligands combined with phosphonic acid anchoring ligands result in surprisingly good performances.31,32 In most of our investigations, Lancillary has been based on a 6,6′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine (dmbpy) scaffold, the methyl substituents preventing flattening of the copper(I) complex in the excited state. The steric bulk of the 6,6′-substituents effectively stabilizes copper(I) with respect to oxidation to copper(II).33 We now present an investigation of four new copper(I)-based sensitizers which retain the N^N metal-binding domain of a diimine ligand in Lancillary, but replace one pyridine ring of bpy by a 2-(1,3-benzoxazolyl), 2-benzimidazolyl or 2-(1,3-benzothiazolyl) unit. Differences in dye performances lead us to investigate co-sensitization strategies utilising two of these dyes which, when used alone exhibit, respectively, a high JSC or a high VOC.
Experimental
General

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III-500 NMR spectrometer at 295 K unless otherwise stated; 1H and 13C chemical shifts were referenced to residual solvent peaks with respect to δ(TMS) = 0 ppm. Solution and solid state absorption spectra were recorded on an Agilent Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker Daltonics Inc. microflex instrument.
Electrochemical measurements were made using a CH Instruments 900B potentiostat with glassy carbon, platinum wire and a leakless AgCl/Ag+ electrode (eDAQ ET069) as the working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Samples were dissolved in dry CH2Cl2 (10−4 to 10−5 mol dm−3) containing [nBu4N][PF6] (0.1 mol dm−3) as the supporting electrolyte; all solutions were degassed with argon. Ferrocene was used as the internal reference.

Electrodes for solid-state absorption spectroscopy
Dye-functionalized electrodes were assembled as detailed below but using Solaronix Test Cell Titania Electrodes Transparent.
DSC fabrication and measurements
Solaronix Test Cell Titania Electrodes were washed with EtOH (HPLC grade), sintered at 450 °C (30 min), then cooled to ≈80 °C before being immersed in a solution of anchor 5 (DMSO, 1.0 mM) for 24 h (ambient temperature). After removal from the solution, the functionalized electrodes were washed with DMSO and EtOH, then dried using a heat gun (∼80 °C). Then, each electrode was dipped in a solution of [Cu(Lancillary)2][PF6] where Lancillary = 1, 2, 3 or 4 (CH2Cl2, 0.1 mM) for 3 days. For co-sensitization, the electrodes functionalized with 5 were immersed in a solution of a 1:1 mixture of [Cu(1)2][PF6] and [Cu(3)2][PF6] (CH2Cl2, 0.1 mM for each complex) for 3 days, or were placed sequentially into dye baths containing [Cu(1)2][PF6] or [Cu(3)2][PF6] (CH2Cl2, 0.1 mM) for 3 days. After removal from the dye-bath, the now orange electrodes were washed with CH2Cl2 and dried using a heat gun (∼80 °C). An N719 reference electrode was made by dipping a Solaronix Test Cell Titania Electrode in a solution (EtOH, 0.3 mM) of N719 (Solaronix) for 3 days. The electrode was removed from the dye-bath, washed with EtOH and dried with a heat gun (∼80 °C). Solaronix Test Cell Platinum Electrodes were used for the counter electrodes; volatile organic impurities were removed by placing the electrodes on a heating plate (450 °C, 30 min).
The working and counter electrodes were joined using thermoplast hot-melt sealing foil (Solaronix Test Cell Gaskets) by heating while pressing them together. Electrolyte composition: LiI (0.1 M), I2 (0.05 M), 1-methylbenzimidazole (0.5 M), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolinium iodide (0.6 M) in 3-methoxypropionitrile. The electrolyte was introduced into the DSC by vacuum backfilling and then the hole in the counter electrode was sealed (Solaronix Test Cell Sealings) and covered (Solaronix Test Cell Caps).
DSC measurements were made by irradiating from the anode side of the cell using a light source SolarSim 150 (100 mW cm−2 = 1 sun). The power of the simulated light was calibrated by using a reference Si cell. All DSCs were completely masked47,48 before measurements were made.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were made using a Spe-Quest quantum efficiency setup (Rera Systems, Netherlands) operating with a 100 W halogen lamp (QTH) and a lambda 300 grating monochromator (Lot Oriel). The monochromatic light was modulated to 3 Hz using a chopper wheel (ThorLabs), and the cell response was amplified with a large dynamic range IV converter (CVI Melles Griot) and then measured with a SR830 DSP Lock-In amplifier (Stanford Research).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out on a ModuLab® XM PhotoEchem photoelectrochemical measurement system from Solartron Analytical. The impedance was measured around the open-circuit potential of the cell at different light intensities (590 nm) in the frequency range 0.05 Hz to 400 kHz using an amplitude of 10 mV. The impedance data were analysed using ZView® software from Scribner Associates Inc.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of the copper complexes
The hybrid ligands 1–4 have been previously been reported.34–39 The homoleptic copper(I) complexes were prepared by reaction of the ligands with [Cu(MeCN)4][PF6], and [Cu(1)2][PF6], [Cu(2)2][PF6], [Cu(3)2][PF6] and [Cu(4)2][PF6] were isolated as red solids in 94.6 to 100% yield. The positive ion electrospray (ESI) mass spectrum of each compound showed a base peak corresponding to [M − PF6]+ (see Experimental section). These were further confirmed in the high resolution ESI mass spectra.

1H and 13C NMR spectra of CD3CN solutions of the complexes were assigned using 2D methods (COSY, NOESY, HMQC and HMBC); for [Cu(1)2][PF6], the correlations were made at 220 K. The 1H NMR spectra of [Cu(2)2][PF6] and [Cu(3)2][PF6] are shown in Fig. 1, S1 and S2† and are well resolved at 295 K. For [Cu(1)2][PF6] which contains an imidazolyl NH, all the signals in the room temperature 1H NMR spectrum (in CD3CN or acetone-d6) are broad; the NH group gives rise to a broad signal centred at δ 11.7 ppm. The signals sharpen upon cooling to 220 K (Fig. 2), and we propose that the temperature dependence of the spectrum arises from a dynamic process (on–off coordination) involving tautomers of the imidazole unit coupled with rotation about the Cpyridine–Cimidazole bond. The 1H NMR spectra recorded below 245 K show evidence for a minor component (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the spectra of acetone-d6 solution of [Cu(1)2][PF6] at 220 K and of ligand 1 at 295 K. The coincidence between the broad signal at δ 8.18 ppm in Fig. 3a with the doublet at δ 8.20 ppm in Fig. 3b suggests that the subspectrum arises from dissociated ligand; the shift in the signal for the NH proton (Fig. 3avs.b) probably indicating the differing hydrogen bonding environment. Replacing the NH by NMe on going from [Cu(1)2][PF6] to [Cu(4)2][PF6] leads to a well resolved 1H NMR spectrum at 295 K, and this supports the proposal that the dynamic behaviour in [Cu(1)2][PF6] involves the imidazole NH group. [Cu(1)2][PF6] must be stored under argon, and solutions of red [Cu(1)2][PF6] which are left standing in air slowly oxidize to the corresponding green copper(II) complex. The presence of the [Cu(1)2]2+ cation is supported by a peak envelope in the ESI MS at m/z 240.4 showing a characteristic isotope pattern with peaks at half-mass separations.

Single crystals of [Cu(2)2][PF6]·0.5CH2Cl2 and [Cu(3)2][PF6] were grown by slow diffusion of Et2O into CH2Cl2 solutions of the compounds. The compounds crystallize in the monoclinic space groups C2/c and P21/c, respectively, and the structures of the [Cu(2)2]+ and [Cu(3)2]+ cations are shown in Fig. 4 and 5. The structure determinations confirm that each of 2 and 3 coordinates in an N,N′-chelating mode. Atom Cu1 in each cation is tetrahedrally sited and N–Cu–N bond angles are given in the captions to Fig. 4 and 5. The Cu–N bond lengths are typical (range 2.033(4) to 2.074(5) Å) and the angle between the least squares planes through the individual ligands in [Cu(2)2]+ is 76.7° and the corresponding angle in [Cu(3)2]+ is 86.1°. The [Cu(2)2]+ cations form columns along the c-axis with face-to-face π-interactions between 1,3-benzoxazole units (Fig. 6). Adjacent pairs of 1,3-benzoxazoles are mutually offset and are related, alternately, by inversion or a 2-fold axis. For the former π-stacking interaction, the distance between the least squares planes through the 1,3-benzoxazoles is 3.23 Å, and the centroid⋯centroid distance is 3.51 Å. For the latter, the angle between least squares planes is 3.7°, and centroid⋯plane and centroid⋯centroid distances are 3.25 and 3.61 Å. The packing of cations in [Cu(3)2][PF6] involves centrosymmetric embraces of cations in which the methyl groups point into the thiazole rings (Fig. 6b); the closest CH⋯thiazolecentroid distance is 3.17 Å.49 In addition, the pyridine ring containing N4 engages in a weak π-stacking contact with the arene ring containing C19i (symmetry code i = 1 − x, −1/2 + y, 1/2 − z) in the adjacent molecule; interaction is not optimal, with centroid⋯centroid and centroid⋯plane separations of 3.84 and 3.47 Å, respectively, and an angle between the ring planes of 9.9°.

Solution absorption spectra and electrochemistry

Fig. 7 shows the solution absorption spectra of the four homoleptic copper(I) complexes; absorption maxima are given in the Experimental section. High-energy bands arise from ligand-based π* ← π and π* ← n transitions, and the broad absorption between 400 and 520 nm is assigned to a metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band. The MLCT absorption maxima, λmax, shift significantly to lower energy as the heteroatom in the ligand is changed: O, 424 nm; NH, 435 nm; NMe, 446 nm; S, 465 nm. The intensity of the MLCT band is greatest with the benzothiazole ligand 3 (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  Solution absorption spectra (in CH2Cl2, 1 × 10−5 mol dm−3) of [Cu(1)2][PF6], [Cu(2)2][PF6], [Cu(3)2][PF6] and [Cu(4)2][PF6]. 
The redox activities of [CuL2][PF6] (L = 1, 2, 3 or 4) were investigated by cyclic voltammetry of CH2Cl2 solutions and a representative cyclic voltammogram (CV) is depicted in Fig. 8. Each complex shows a reversible metal-centred oxidation process (Table 1) assigned to the Cu+/Cu2+ redox couple. The potentials for [Cu(1)2][PF6] and [Cu(4)2][PF6] (differing only in NH vs. NMe) are similar, and are also similar to that for [Cu(dmbpy)2][PF6] (+0.17 V in CH3CN).50 Introduction of O or S heteroatoms on going to [Cu(2)2][PF6] or [Cu(3)2][PF6], respectively, shifts the copper(I) oxidation to higher potential (Table 1), indicating a better π-acceptor ability, consistent with the red shift in the absorption spectrum of 3. The four copper(I) complexes show poorly defined reduction processes as presented for [Cu(4)2][PF6] in Fig. 8. For [Cu(1)2][PF6] and [Cu(4)2][PF6], no significant changes in the CV were observed through three successive cycles, whereas both [Cu(2)2][PF6] and [Cu(3)2][PF6] developed an additional irreversible process at positive potential in subsequent scans. The trend in oxidation potentials is consistent with that observed on going from [Ru(bpy)2(L-NMe)]2+ to [Ru(bpy)2(L-S)]2+ (Eox = +1.13 and +1.37 V, respectively, vs. SCE where L-NMe = 2-(2-pyridyl)-1-methylbenzimidazole and L-S = 2-(2-pyridyl)benzothiazole).51

Solid-state absorption spectra of adsorbed dyes
Transparent FTO/TiO2 electrodes were functionalized with a heteroleptic copper(I) dye using our established ‘surface-as-ligand’ strategy.28 The electrodes were immersed in a DMSO solution of the anchoring ligand 5 (Scheme 1), dried, and then dipped in a CH2Cl2 solution of the appropriate homoleptic complex [Cu(1)2][PF6], [Cu(2)2][PF6], [Cu(3)2][PF6] or [Cu(4)2][PF6]. The solid-state absorption spectra of the surface-assembled dyes [Cu(5)(1)]+ (λmax ∼ 443 nm), [Cu(5)(2)]+ (λmax ∼ 445 nm), [Cu(5)(3)]+ (λmax ∼ 471 nm) and [Cu(5)(4)]+ (λmax ∼ 453 nm) are presented in Fig. 9. The absorption maxima for the MLCT bands of the surface-adsorbed heteroleptic dyes are red-shifted with respect to the solution spectra of the homoleptic complexes shown in Fig. 7. The benzothiazole-containing dye exhibits the lowest energy MLCT band, with an absorption tail to ∼600 nm (Fig. 9).

DSC performances with single dyes
Duplicate DSCs were assembled (see Experimental section) with surface-bound dyes [Cu(5)(1)]+, [Cu(5)(2)]+, [Cu(5)(3)]+ or [Cu(5)(4)]+. The performances of masked cells are summarized in Tables S1† and 2 gives the characteristics of the better performing cell of each duplicate pair. The data confirm that the devices remain stable over a period of a week and values of JSC, VOC and η for duplicate DSCs (Table S1†) confirm the reproducibility of the measurements. The slight improvement in efficiency on going from day 0 to 7 (Table 2) follows trends previously observed from other copper(I) sensitizers.28,31,52 Similar enhancement has been observed for ruthenium(II) dyes and is most likely associated with the initial formation of aggregates of the dye molecules on the surface followed by molecular reorganization over periods of days.53–55 The performance of one DSC containing [Cu(5)(2)]+ was tested after the cell had been stored in the dark for 9 months; values of JSC, VOC and η were 4.86 mA cm−2, 605 mV and 2.15%, emphasizing the long-term stability of the device.

Values of JSC, VOC and η in Table 2 are compared to those for a reference DSC containing the standard ruthenium dye N719, and the final column in Table 2 gives a relative η with respect to 100% for N719. We routinely use this practice to allow valid comparisons between measurements on different sun simulators and with different transparent metal oxide assemblies.56Fig. 10 shows J–V curves for DSCs containing dyes [Cu(5)(L)]+ with L = 1, 2, 3 or 4. All DSCs exhibit good fill-factors (ff) which contributes to overall photoconversion efficiencies of between 2.62% for [Cu(5)(2)]+ to 3.03% for [Cu(5)(1)]+ on the initial day (Table 2). External quantum efficiency (EQE) data are presented in Table 3 and Fig. 11, and reveal that all dyes give EQEmax of 53–55%. The EQE spectra all exhibit λmax = 480 nm, despite the variation (443–471 nm) observed in the broad MLCT solid-state absorption spectra of the dyes. Since the presence of protons at the TiO2 surface is known to influence dye performance,57,58 we were interested to compare the performances of DSCs sensitized by [Cu(5)(1)]+ and [Cu(5)(4)]+. Data in Tables 2 and S1† reveal little change in the values of JSC on replacing the imidazolyl NH by NMe, but rather a drop in VOC of ∼50 mV; the near overlap of the EQE spectra (Fig. 11) is consistent with the small differences observed in the values of JSC. We note in passing that the protonation microstate of anchoring ligand 5 on the semiconductor surface is not known.

 Fig. 11  EQE spectra recorded on the day of cell assembly (day 0) for the DSCs given in Table 3 with dyes [Cu(5)(L)]+ (L = 1, 2, 3 or 4). 
Of particular note in Fig. 10 is that ancillary ligand 3 (S-containing) leads to the highest short-circuit current density (7.76 mA cm−2), while the open-circuit voltage is optimized when the ancillary ligand is 1 (NH-containing). This suggested to us that there could be benefits in using a mixed dye co-sensitized approach.
Co-sensitization: solid-state absorption spectra of dye-functionalized electrodes
Transparent FTO/TiO2 electrodes were functionalized with anchor 5 and then immersed in a CH2Cl2 solution containing a 1:1 mixture of [Cu(1)2][PF6] and [Cu(3)2][PF6]. Fig. 12a compares the solid-state absorption spectra of these electrodes with those functionalized with the complexes [Cu(5)(1)]+ or [Cu(5)(3)]+. Compared to values of λmax of 443 and 471 nm, respectively, for the single dyes, the co-sensitized surface has an absorption maximum at ∼440 nm, most reminiscent of [Cu(5)(1)]+. This suggested that competition between the dyes in the 1:1 mixture leads to preferential coverage with [Cu(5)(1)]+ rather than a mixture of [Cu(5)(1)]+ and [Cu(5)(3)]+ and that dye-bath solution composition is not reflected in the composition of dyes on the surface. This is supported by the DSC measurements (see later). We then investigated the solid-state absorption spectra of FTO/TiO2 electrodes functionalized with 5 which were then sequentially dipped in dye baths containing [Cu(1)2][PF6] and then [Cu(3)2][PF6] (Fig. 12b, co-sensitized ‘1 then 3’) or [Cu(3)2][PF6] and then [Cu(1)2][PF6] (Fig. 12b, co-sensitized ‘3 then 1’). For the latter, the solid-state absorption spectrum maximum at λmax = 442 nm replicates that of the single dye [Cu(5)(1)]+ (443 nm), again consistent with replacement of surface-coordinated 3 by 1 in the second dye-bath. In contrast, the broad MLCT absorption for co-sensitized surface ‘1 then 3’ (Fig. 12b, green curve) with λmax ∼ 460 nm suggests that both dyes [Cu(5)(1)]+ and [Cu(5)(3)]+ are bound to the TiO2. Taken in conjunction with the solution UV-vis spectroscopic data and solution electrochemical data reported earlier, this suggests that 1 is a significantly stronger σ-donor than 3.
 Fig. 12  Solid-state absorption spectra of FTO/TiO2 electrodes functionalized with single dyes [Cu(5)(1)]+ (purple line) or [Cu(5)(3)]+ (blue line) compared with (a) electrodes functionalized with 5 and then treated with a 1:1 mixture of [Cu(1)2][PF6] and [Cu(3)2][PF6] (co-sensitized, orange line); (b) 5 and then treated sequentially with [Cu(1)2][PF6] then [Cu(3)2][PF6] (green line) or [Cu(3)2][PF6] then [Cu(1)2][PF6] (yellow line). 
Co-sensitization: DSC performances
FTO/TiO2 electrodes with a scattering layer (Solaronix Test Cell Titania) were functionalized with anchor 5 and then immersed in a dye bath containing a 1:1 mixture of [Cu(1)2][PF6] and [Cu(3)2][PF6], or sequentially in dye baths containing [Cu(1)2][PF6] followed by [Cu(3)2][PF6], or [Cu(3)2][PF6] followed by [Cu(1)2][PF6] (Fig. 12b, co-sensitized ‘3 then 1’). The active dyes in every case were [Cu(5)(1)]+ or [Cu(5)(3)]+, arising from the exchange reactions:FTO/TiO2/(5) + [Cu(1)2]+ → FTO/TiO2/[(5)Cu(1)]+ + 1FTO/TiO2/(5) + [Cu(3)2]+ → FTO/TiO2/[(5)Cu(3)]+ + 3
All measurements were carried out in duplicate and the performance data for the better performing of each pair of co-sensitized DSCs are given in Table 4. The complete data set is presented in Table S2,† and J–V curves are shown in Fig. 13.

 Fig. 13  
J–V curves for the DSCs given in Table 4. Curves were recorded on the day of cell assembly (day 0), then 3 and 7 days later. The legend abbreviations correspond to the explanation given in the left-hand column of Table 4. 
We first consider the use of the 1:1 dye-bath. A comparison of the performances of the single-dye-containing DSCs (Table 2) with those of the co-sensitized cells shows that the high VOC values of DSCs sensitized with only [Cu(5)(1)]+ are also observed for the co-sensitized cells. The small gain in JSC (6.93 to 7.20 mA cm−2) is consistent with a small increase in EQEmax (53.0%, Table 3 to 56.8%, Table 4). The latter is maintained over a period of a week after fabricating the cells. While the overall efficiencies of ∼3% (Tables 4 and S2†) are satisfyingly 40% that of the N719 reference DSC and the cells are stable over a period of a week (Fig. 13, orange curves), there is no noticeable enhancement with respect to the DSCs sensitized with [Cu(5)(1)]+ alone and, taken with the solid-state absorption data, suggest that surface-coverage by [Cu(5)(1)]+ is dominant when the electrode functionalized with anchor 5 is exposed to both [Cu(1)2]+ and [Cu(3)2]+.
Next, we consider electrodes functionalized with 5 that are treated sequentially with [Cu(3)2]+ and then [Cu(1)2]+. The performances of these DSCs are rather similar to those fabricated using the mixed dye-bath (Tables 4 and S2†). Again, values of JSC and VOC, the EQEmax and solid-state absorption spectra are all consistent with the dominant dye being [Cu(5)(1)]+. Exposing the anchor-functionalized electrodes to the homoleptic copper(I) complexes in the reverse order, (i.e. [Cu(1)2]+ then [Cu(3)2]+) results in poorer performing DSCs. The high values of JSC that were characteristic of the single S-containing dye [Cu(5)(3)]+ are not observed for the mixed dye system. The values of VOC for DSCs with dyes assembled by the ‘3 then 1’ procedure are close to those obtained when the dyes are assembled using the 1:1 mixture of [Cu(1)2][PF6] and [Cu(3)2][PF6] in the dye-bath (Fig. 13). Moreover, the VOC values replicate those observed for the DSCs with the single dye [Cu(5)(1)]+. In contrast, VOC values for DSCs with dyes assembled by the ‘1 then 3’ method are similar to those of DSCs with single dye [Cu(5)(3)]+. The results from this part of the investigation are consistent with competition for surface binding-sites with ligand 1 dominating over 3, both in binding and in contribution to the overall photoresponse.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS): introduction
From the underlying principles set out by Heaviside at the end of the 19th century, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has developed into a valuable tool for investigating the mechanisms of electrochemical reactions and determining dielectric and transport properties of materials.59 In addition to applications in the study of reaction mechanisms, corrosion and surface processes, semiconductors and batteries,60 EIS plays an important role in investigating physical processes within DSCs.61–63 For example, key parameters including recombination resistance (Rrec), transport resistance (Rtr) and chemical capacitance (Cμ) can be extracted from EIS data.
EIS measurements may be made with an adjustable light source in order to investigate the effect of illumination intensity, using a potentiostat to apply a small AC current of varied frequency. While measuring near VOC conditions, the resulting impedance response is recorded as a function of light intensity and applied frequency. The data are usually represented in a Nyquist plot (Fig. 14) in which, ideally, three separate semi-circles are observed. Each semi-circle corresponds to the impedance of a specific interfacial charge transfer process occurring at a given frequency. Starting at the origin of the Nyquist plot, the distance from zero to the start of the first semi-circle describes the series resistance (Rs) within the whole measurement. This arises predominantly from the charge resistance of the TiO2/FTO interface.64 The first semi-circle displays the cathode/electrolyte charge transfer resistance (RPt), the second the recombination resistance of the active layer/electrolyte interface (Rrec) and the third corresponds to the diffusion resistance of the charge carriers within the electrolyte (Rd). The semi-circle corresponding to Rd may be hidden due to overlapping with the Rrec semi-circle.65
 Fig. 14  A schematic diagram of a Nyquist plot of a well functioning DSC at high light intensity showing overlapping semi-circles which have been extrapolated for clarity. 

Fig. 15 displays the equivalent circuit model that we have adopted for the fitting of DSC data. The model consists of five elements. First, an extended distributed element (DX1) was used for fitting of the active layer/electrolyte interface according to the transition line model.66 A Warburg diffusion element (Ws1) was introduced to model the diffusion impedance of the charge carrier through the electrolyte close to the dye-functionalized semiconductor surface. The sub-circuit containing a series resistance (R1) and a constant phase element (CPE1) models the Pt counter electrode. The constant phase element was used instead of a capacitor circuit element to obtain a better fit taking surface roughness into account which is not the case of an ideal capacitor.67 A further series resistance (R2) was introduced to model the series resistance of the device throughout the entire measurement.
 Fig. 15  Equivalent electric circuit used to model EIS data. 
In the following discussion, we first consider DSCs containing the single surface-bound dyes [Cu(5)(1)]+, [Cu(5)(2)]+, [Cu(5)(3)]+ or [Cu(5)(4)]+. The influence of the heteroatom is initially investigated, and then the impact of replacing a proton by a methyl group on going from ligand 1 to 4. Finally, we consider the different co-sensitized DSCs. All EIS measurements were conducted 3 days after sealing the cell. All DSCs utilize the same anchoring ligand 5, and have identical electrolyte composition as well as TiO2 semiconductor and counter electrodes.
EIS for DSCs containing [Cu(5)(1)]+, [Cu(5)(2)]+, [Cu(5)(3)]+ or [Cu(5)(4)]+
The key parameters of the EIS measurement at a light intensity of 22 mW cm−2 are given in Table 5, and those for a light intensity of 2.2 mW cm−2 in Table 6. The data in Table 5 demonstrate that DSCs with [Cu(5)(1)]+, [Cu(5)(2)]+ and [Cu(5)(3)]+ have a higher chemical capacitance (Cμ) and lower recombination resistance (Rrec). The higher the capacitance, the higher the total charge density in the TiO2 semiconductor, and the more electrons reside in the conduction band prior to collection. When the transport resistance (Rtr) is also low, a higher JSC is observed because of the higher mobility of electrons and shorter transit times in the semiconductor. The fact that Rtr is rather low relative to Rrec (see later discussion) in all of the DSCs (Table 6) is shown by the good separation of the first and second semi-circles in the Nyquist plot shown in Fig. 16 and S3.†

A comparison of the DSCs containing dyes [Cu(5)(1)]+ and [Cu(5)(2)]+ is instructive. At high light intensities, [Cu(5)(1)]+ leads to a higher Cμ and a lower Rrec. However, in this case the negative influence on the performance of the DSC of a low Rrec is partly offset by a low Rtr (Table 6) with the result that the electrons are easily transported through the semiconductor. This results in the high JSC (6.88 mA cm−2 on day 3, see Table S1†) of the DSCs containing the dye [Cu(5)(1)]+. The Rtr values are extracted from the EIS measurements at low light intensities (Table 6), because Rtr is more dominant at moderate voltages, as is seen in Fig. 17 and S4.† On the other hand, DSCs with ancillary ligand 2 have a low Cμ and a high Rrec in conjunction with a comparable Rtr. Here, the lowest JSC value (6.19 mA cm−2 on day 3, see Table S1†) is observed because fewer electrons are injected to the semiconductor, whilst the electron transport remains comparable to DSCs with ligand 1. DSCs with 3 have the lowest Rtr of all single dye DSCs (see Table 6) but the Cμ and Rrec lie in between those of 1 and 2 at high light intensities (see Table 5). This trend is observed in the rather high JSC (6.77 mA cm−2 on day 3, see Table S1†) of the DSCs containing the dye [Cu(5)(3)]+ found in the J–V measurements (Table 2).

In a DSC, the theoretical VOC is the difference between the energy level of the redox couple in the electrolyte and the Fermi level (EF) of the semiconductor. The latter may be altered by increasing or decreasing the conduction band (CB) level; a more negative CB leads to an increase in VOC and vice versa. In this study, the I−/I3− electrolyte is constant and observed changes in VOC arise from changes to the CB level of the semiconductor brought about by the variation in dye. As seen in Table 2, the highest VOC is observed with a DSC containing [Cu(5)(1)]+ and the lowest with [Cu(5)(3)]+. The trends in the J–V curves are also observed in the EIS measurements at a light intensity of 22 mW cm−2 under open-circuit voltage conditions. As stated above, more efficient electron injection may result in a higher Cμ. However, a better charge injection is favoured by a more extensive charge compensation which, in turn, results in a lower CB level and, consequently, a lower VOC.68 In addition to the influence of the charge compensation on the CB level, the electron recombination with the I3− in the electrolyte also has an impact. A relatively high Cμ and a high Rrec yield a good value for the electron lifetime (τ), calculated as the product of Cμ and Rrec. All DSCs show values of τ between 54 and 62 ms. A higher τ implies a lower charge loss in the semiconductor which keeps VOC at a high value. The length of the diffusion path (Ld) for electrons in the semiconductor is also a good parameter to understand the functioning of the device. For a well-functioning cell, Ld should be greater than the thickness of the semiconductor layer. This is the case for all the DSCs studied, even at low light intensities. Table 6 shows that the DSCs have Ld values of 30–35 μm, about three times the thickness of the semiconductor (≈12 μm). In conclusion, the more electrons are accumulated in the semiconductor, the more likely it is that the CB level is shifted to more negative potential and the higher the resulting VOC. The interplay of all of these parameters influence the VOC, although the direct impact of individual parameters cannot be extracted.
We now consider the effect of replacing the imidazolyl NH by NMe in comparing ancillary ligands 1 and 4. When comparing the J–V curves of DSCs containing surface-bound dyes [Cu(5)(1)]+ or [Cu(5)(4)]+ (purple and orange curves in Fig. 10), the only significant differences are in VOC (608 mV for [Cu(5)(1)]+ and 558 mV for [Cu(5)(4)]+ on the day of sealing the DSCs, and 604 and 555 mV, respectively, on day 3, Table S1†). The EIS measurements (Tables 5 and 6) demonstrate that the DSC with [Cu(5)(1)]+ has a higher Cμ but a lower Rrec and lower Rtr than with [Cu(5)(4)]+. The higher Cμ and the lower Rtr of DSCs containing [Cu(5)(1)]+versus [Cu(5)(4)]+ should result in a higher JSC. On the other hand, the higher Rrec of [Cu(5)(4)]+ might lead to comparable JSC values (Tables 2 and S1†). The only molecular difference between these dyes is the imidazolyl NH (in 1) versus NMe (in 4). The higher Rrec of the DSC with [Cu(5)(4)]+ may be an effect of the methyl group shielding the semiconductor surface through increased steric hindrance compared to [Cu(5)(1)]+. Consequently, less electrolyte can reach the surface to promote recombination reactions between the injected electrons and the electrolyte. The fact that neither a higher Cμ nor higher VOC is associated with ancillary ligand 4 suggests that the presence of the electron-donating Me group does not lead to better charge injection. As stated earlier, the only notable difference between the DSCs containing [Cu(5)(1)]+ and [Cu(5)(4)]+ is the VOC. From an EIS point of view, the origin of this difference can be seen in the values of τ and Ld. Both parameters are higher for the DSC containing [Cu(5)(1)]+. As already discussed, compared to the DSC with [Cu(5)(4)]+, that with [Cu(5)(1)]+ benefits from a higher Cμ and lower Rtr. Consequently, less electron loss in the semiconductor results in a higher population of electrons in the CB, and as a consequence, a higher EF and a higher VOC. In conclusion, the high Cμ, low Rtr, and good Ld and τ values contribute to the high values of VOC and JSC observed for DSCs with the dye [Cu(5)(1)]+ (Tables 2 and S1†).
EIS for DSCs co-sensitized with [Cu(5)(1)]+ and [Cu(5)(3)]+
The J–V measurements of the DSCs containing [Cu(5)(1)]+ and [Cu(5)(3)]+ showed that use of ancillary ligand 1 or 3 leads to the highest VOC or JSC, respectively. The results of co-sensitization experiments were significantly affected by the different dipping conditions used in the dye-baths, and the latter are expected to have an impact on the EIS parameters. EIS data for co-sensitized DSCs are presented in Tables 7 and 8, and the nomenclature in the left-hand column is the same as in Table 4.

DSCs with electrodes functionalized with 5 and then soaked in a dye-bath containing a 1:1 mixture of [Cu(3)2]+ and [Cu(1)2]+ gave the highest Cμ (Table 7) of all measured DSCs. The high Cμ is consistent with the observed high JSC (Table 4). The moderate value of Rtr facilitates improved electron transport in the semiconductor which, in turn, enhances JSC. However, the relatively low Rrec militates against further enhancement of the value of JSC. The EIS parameters for DSCs with electrodes functionalized with 5 and then soaked sequentially in dye-baths containing [Cu(3)2]+ then [Cu(1)2]+ are comparable with those using the 1:1 mixture of [Cu(3)2]+ and [Cu(1)2]+ (Tables 7 and 8). Of particular note is the increase in Rrec on going from the mixed to sequential dye-baths. Exposing the electrodes with adsorbed anchor 5 to the homoleptic copper(I) complexes in the reverse order, (i.e. [Cu(1)2]+ then [Cu(3)2]+) results in the lowest Cμ value in this study. In addition, Rtr is very high and Rrec is rather low. The very large Rtr meant that the data could not be fitted with the model in Fig. 15 at a low light intensity (Table 8); a Gerischer circuit element would have been needed in order to produce a good fit. However, this was not carried out since it was sufficient to establish that the Rtr of this cell is significantly larger than for the others in the series (Fig. 18 and S5†). The high Rtr is reflected in the EIS measurements at high light intensities (Fig. 19 and S6†) where the first and second semi-circle overlap (see earlier discussion). Because of the high Rtr and low Rrec, the tendency for electron injection into the CB as well as the charge density in the semiconductor are reduced. Additionally, the recombination reaction with the electrolyte is dominant, and electrons in the semiconductor are lost by recombination. It follows that VOC is low for DSCs assembled using the dye-baths in the sequence [Cu(1)2]+ then [Cu(3)2]+ (Table 7). Once again, the impact of all EIS parameters on VOC is apparent. The electron lifetime τ for ‘1 then 3’ co-sensitized DSCs at high light intensity is 23 ms which is much shorter (Table 7) than those of DSCs made using ‘3 then 1’ co-sensitization (τ = 55 ms) or a 1:1 mixture of [Cu(3)2]+ and [Cu(1)2]+ (τ = 49 ms). The latter are in the same range as for the DSCs containing the single dyes 1 or 3 (Table 5). Similar trends are observed at lower light intensities (Tables 6 and 8). We note that Ld is, in the case of the DSCs made with a combination of dyes, higher than in the single dye DSCs. The cell with the ‘3 then 1’ dipping procedure has a value of Ld = 45 μm which is the highest Ld in this study.

The comparison of EIS data for DSCs made with a combination of dyes versus a single dye shows the dominant effect of ancillary ligand 1 on the device performance. The data are consistent with the solid-state absorption measurements (Fig. 12) and the J–V measurements (Fig. 13) discussed above and indicate that ancillary ligand 1 replaces 3 more efficiently than vice versa. When a ‘3 then 1’ dipping procedure is used, the EIS parameters are comparable to single-dye DSCs containing the surface-bound dye [Cu(5)(1)]+. Both cells have the same Rtr, comparable Rrec and Cμ, as well as similar τ at a light intensity of 22 mW cm−2. On the other hand, DSCs assembled by the ‘1 then 3’ dipping method have a much lower Cμ than the single dye DSCs with single surface-bound dye [Cu(5)(3)]+. Furthermore, Rrec is lower and Rtr is more than twice the value of the appropriate single dye DSC. Additionally, the electron lifetime τ at a light intensity of 22 mW cm−2 is only about the half of the single dye DSCs. This results in the lower overall efficiency of DSCs made using the ‘1 then 3’ dipping procedure.
Conclusions
The synthesis and characterization of four new homoleptic copper(I) complexes [Cu(1)2][PF6], [Cu(2)2][PF6], [Cu(3)2][PF6] and [Cu(4)2][PF6] have been described, along with the single crystal structures of [Cu(2)2][PF6]·0.5CH2Cl2 and [Cu(3)2][PF6]. The latter confirms that the tetrahedral copper(I) centre is bound by N,N′-ligands. At 298 K, well-resolved solution 1H NMR spectra are observed for [Cu(2)2][PF6], [Cu(3)2][PF6] and [Cu(4)2][PF6], but for [Cu(1)2][PF6] the signals are broad. Variable temperature NMR spectroscopic data are consistent with dynamic behaviour which we attribute to on–off coordination involving tautomers of the imidazole unit combined with rotation about the Cpyridine–Cimidazole bond. The heteroatom has an influence on the energy of the MLCT band in the solution absorption spectrum, and the band shifts to lower energy in the order O < NH < NMe < S. In solution, [Cu(1)2][PF6] and [Cu(4)2][PF6] undergo copper-centred oxidative processes at lower potential than the complexes with O or S heteroatoms.
We have investigated the performances of duplicate, fully-masked DSCs containing the surface-bound heteroleptic dyes [Cu(5)(L)]+ with L = 1–4. The shift in the MLCT band (O ∼ NH < NMe < S) in the solid-state absorption spectra of the dye-functionalized electrodes follows a similar trend to that observed in solution. The photoconversion efficiencies of DSCs containing surface-assembled and surface-bound [Cu(5)(L)]+ (L = 1–4) dyes and an I−/I3− redox couple follow the order [Cu(5)(1)]+ (3.03%) > [Cu(5)(3)]+ (2.88%) > [Cu(5)(4)]+ (2.71%) > [Cu(5)(2)]+ (2.62%) relative to 7.55% for N719. A significant observation is that use of ancillary ligand 1 (with NH) leads to the highest VOC (608 mV) whilst 3 (S-heteroatom) gives the highest JSC (7.76 mA cm−2). EIS gives valuable insights into the reasons why [Cu(5)(1)]+ and [Cu(5)(3)]+ perform well. The DSC with [Cu(5)(1)]+ exhibits a high Cμ and a low Rrec; since the latter is offset by a low Rtr, a high JSC and VOC are observed for [Cu(5)(1)]+. DSCs with [Cu(5)(3)]+ have the lowest Rtr of all four devices.
Co-sensitization of DSCs using combinations of copper(I) dyes has, to our knowledge, not previously been investigated. In this work we have assessed the performance of DSCs sensitized by a combination of [Cu(5)(1)]+ and [Cu(5)(3)]+, the aim being to exploit the high VOC of [Cu(5)(1)]+ and the high JSC of [Cu(5)(3)]+. We conclude that the order in which the anchoring ligand-functionalized FTO/TiO2 electrodes are exposed to [Cu(1)2]+ and [Cu(3)2]+ has a significant impact of the DSC performances. Observed values of JSC and VOC, and EIS parameters are consistent with competition between 1 and 3 for surface binding-sites, with ancillary ligand 1 preferred over 3, both in binding and in contribution to the overall photoresponse. DSCs made with FTO/TiO2/5 electrodes treated with a 1:1 mix of [Cu(1)2][PF6] and [Cu(3)2][PF6] or sequentially with [Cu(3)2][PF6] then [Cu(1)2][PF6] show similarly high JSC values (7.20 and 6.91 mA cm−2) and comparable VOC (592 and 588 mV) leading to photoconversions of 3.02 and 2.96% relative to 7.55% for N719. However, sequential treatment with [Cu(1)2][PF6] then [Cu(3)2][PF6] is detrimental to DSC performance.
Overall, we conclude that when ancillary ligands 1 and 3, although structurally simple, are combined in a surface-bound heteroleptic copper(I) dye with the phosphonic acid anchoring ligand 5, photoconversion efficiencies reaching 40% that of the ruthenium dye N719 are achieved. This is the first report of co-sensitization of DSCs using combinations of copper(I) dyes. This is an important development as it opens the way to a strategy for harvesting the full solar energy spectrum without the need for designing new panchromatic complexes.
