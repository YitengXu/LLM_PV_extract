    , Accepted 7th August 2017First published on 8th August 2017AbstractThis paper proposes a novel and facile strategy to synthesize hierarchical nanostructured NiCo2S4via a simple hydrothermal reaction combined with a post anion-exchange reaction that was used directly as an electrode in supercapacitor and quantum-dot sensitized solar cells. By applying the appropriate material concentration, deposition temperature, and time, the NiCo2S4 was densely deposited over the entire surface of the Ni foam with good adhesion. The NiCo2S4 electrode exhibited outstanding electrochemical performance in both the applications with a high specific capacitance of 1612.95 F g−1, energy density of 56 W h kg−1 at 5 A g−1, good cycling stability, power conversion efficiency of 3.94%, and Jsc of 12.27 mA cm−2. The NiCo2S4 electrode exhibited almost double the output values compared to NiCo2O4 (693.6 F g−1 at 6.66 A g−1 and efficiency of 1.81%) and NiCo2Se (1401.4 F g−1 at 10 A g−1 and efficiency of 3.86%), resulting from the excellent electrochemical performance of the NiCo2S4. Overall the excellent performance of the fabricated electrode was attributed mainly to the highly electrocatalytic activity, large surface area and decent conductivity of the hierarchical nanostructures of the NiCo2S4. This study shows that the NiCo2S4 nanostructures can be applied not only in high energy density fields, but also in high power density and energy harvesting applications.
1. Introduction
The detrimental long-term effects of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, industrialization at an enormous pace, increasing global population, and the finite supply of fossil fuels underscore the urgency of exploring renewable energy resources as well as energy storage, generation, and conservation technologies.1,2 In this fast growing world, lightweight, high-performance, environmentally friendly, safe, and long lifespan energy storage devices are needed urgently for sustainable and renewable power sources in the modern electronics industry. Until now, a number of electrical energy storage (EES) technologies have been developed for use in daily life (batteries and fuel cells) and for industrial applications, such as compressed air, superconducting magnetic, pumped hydro, flywheels, and supercapacitors (SCs).3 Li-ion batteries can be rechargeable or non-rechargeable depending on the specific battery chemistry and both can produce electricity from chemical energy. Typically, Li-ion batteries have low power density, high energy densities and limited cycle lives because of the lack of a fully reversible redox reaction during the charge and discharge process.4,5
SCs, which are often referred to as ultracapacitors or electrochemical capacitors, demonstrate outstanding power density compared to batteries, and have a higher energy density than conventional dielectric capacitors. In addition, they have a very long cycle life (>1000000 cycles), ease of integration into electronics, and simple mode of operation.6 SCs are considered to be the ideal storage device and they generate less thermochemical heat because of the simpler charge storage mechanisms associated with them. Owing to the multiple advantages listed above, these SCs have been used widely in memory back-up systems, consumer electronics, energy management and industrial power, and are expected to be found in more niche markets in the near future.7,8 On the other hand, there are certain areas where SCs have shortcomings or fail to meet various needs, such as low energy density, compared to batteries. Therefore, the central issue in the development of practical SCs is to identify new materials and fabricate high energy SCs without losing the above-mentioned benefits. Therefore, there is increasing focus on identifying a single electrode system for both SC and quantum-dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) that would be beneficial for compact electronic devices and smart energy storage.
In general, typical QDSSCs are composed of quantum dot semiconductor materials, such as CdS and CdSe sensitized as a photoanode, a redox electrolyte consisting of the polysulfide redox couple, and a counter electrode (CE).9,10 These QDSSCs are attractive owing to their high absorption coefficient, hot-carrier transfer, larger intrinsic dipole moments leading to charge separation, size-dependent tunable band gap with quantum confinement to suit the solar spectrum, and the generation of multiple electron carriers under high energy excitation. Although QDSSCs have tremendous advantages, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is still behind that of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) because of the high charge transfer resistance between the CE/electrolyte and high electron recombination occurring at the photoanode/electrolyte. In QDSSCs, the CE plays a vital role because the bifunctional CE collects electrons from the external circuit and reduction occurs at the CE. Platinum has been a successful candidate for the CE in DSSC because of its higher electron catalytic activity for the organic iodide/triode redox electrolyte. On the other hand, in conjunction with the polysulfide redox electrolyte, Pt and other metals, such as Au, are not effective CEs because the physical adsorption of sulfur-containing groups on the surface of Pt limits the surface activity and conductivity of the electrode.11 To overcome this problem, other efficient CE materials in conjunction of the polysulfide electrolyte have been investigated to achieve a higher PCE and low charge transfer resistance.
Two charge storage processes occur in SCs: a Faradaic charge transfer process introduced by Trasatti et al. (i.e. pseudocapacitors that employ electroactive materials of transition metal hydroxides/oxides and their composites) and a non-Faradaic charge storage accumulation process developed accurately by the Gouy–Chapman–Stern model.12 Electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) use graphene, activated carbon, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and carbon aerogels to prepare active materials in SCs. Currently pseudocapacitors have attracted considerable attention owing to their high specific capacitance, enhanced working potential window, and ability to store more charge than EDLCs because of the continuous reversible redox reactions in electroactive materials.13
Until now, numerous materials, including conducting polymers, transition metal compounds, carbon-based materials, and single transition metal oxides/hydroxides, have been studied extensively in SC and QDSSC applications. Previous studies have shown that electrodes with the appropriate network microstructures and porosity can improve the power density and cycling stability for SCs. Unfortunately, the inferior performance of electrode materials, such as the meager cycling stability in conducting polymers, low specific capacitance in carbon-based materials, high cost of RuO2, and very low electrical conductivity in transition metal oxides, limits their practical applications.14,15
Compared with carbon nanomaterials, the transition-metal sulfides, such as NiSx and CoSx have received extra attention due to their higher theoretical capacitance and multiple redox reactions in SCs. Unfortunately, poor electrochemical performance was observed due to their low surface area and non-porosity. In order to address this problem, many researchers have been working on the synthesis and design of metal sulfides with a higher surface area to enhance the performance of SCs. Mixing metal sulfides with low cost elements (Ni, Mn, Fe and Sn) are another interesting way of enhancing the surface area and specific capacitance because the introduction of mixing can lead to superior electrical conductivity.15 Among the emerging electrode materials for SCs, NiCo2O3, NiCo2Se, and NiCo2S4 are the most promising electrode materials owing to their high specific capacitance from the rapid and reversible redox reactions on the active electrode surface. In particular, NiCo2S4 has attracted recent interest due to its richer redox reactions than the corresponding binary NiSx and CoSx, low-cost, natural abundance, and environmental benignity. In addition, it has a major advantage over NiCo2O4 in terms of its higher conductivity. NiCo2S4 powder is generally synthesized by using a hydrothermal method and a slurry is coated directly on the substrate, which seriously limits the capacitive performance due to the increased “dead surface”.16 An effective way to improve the utilization of NiCo2S4 is to grow the material directly on a conductive substrate to form an integrated electrode for electrochemical evaluations. NiCo2S4 nanostructures can be directly synthesized on a conductive substrate using different growth methods, such as chemical bath deposition, solvothermal methods, microwave-assisted methods, hydrothermal synthesis, and the electrochemical deposition method (EDM).17–20 Among these methods, the EDM is relatively attractive because it can grow functional materials through complex 3D masks and be performed at room temperature for a short growth time from water-based electrolytes. The EDM is carried out using a three electrode system with a counter electrode (i.e. Pt wire) and reference electrodes, such as the standard calomel and Ag/AgCl electrode. On the other hand, these reference electrodes are quite sensitive and expensive. Moreover, the tip of the reference electrode might be broken during the EDM process under increased temperature.6
Based on the above consideration, this paper reports a facile, cost-effective, and eco-friendly metal source to obtain well-assembled porous NiCo2O4, NiCo2S4, and NiCoSe on Ni foam using a simple hydrothermal method followed by thermal treatment. The as-fabricated NiCo2S4 electrode produced efficient performance in a SC and also good CE performance in a QDSSC. Assembled in QDSSCs, the hierarchical nanostructured electrode showed a good PCE, fill factor, Voc, and Jsc of 3.94%, 0.54, 0.58 V, and 12.27 mA cm−2, respectively. Moreover, the NiCo2S4 possessed an enhanced specific capacitance of 1612.95 F g−1 at 5 A g−1 and energy density of 56 W h kg−1 and excellent cycling performance.
2. Experimental methods
2.1 Preparation of the Ni foam substrate
Prior to synthesis, the Ni foam substrate (1 cm × 1 cm in rectangular shape) was cleaned by sonication in acetone for 15 min and immersed into an HCl solution for 15 min to remove the surface oxide layer. Finally, the Ni foam was washed sequentially in ethanol and deionized (DI) water for 10 min each, and dried with a hair dryer.
2.2 Fabrication of Hierarchical NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays
All the chemicals used in the experiment were of analytical grade and used without any further purification. Hierarchical NiCo2O4/Ni foam nanowire arrays were synthesized from a simple hydrothermal method, according to similar procedures reported elsewhere. In a typical procedure, the growth solution was prepared by mixing 8 mmol of CoCl2·6H2O, 4 mmol of NiCl2·6H2O, and 12 mmol of urea in 60 mL of DI water to form a clear pink solution at room temperature. Sequentially, the mixed solution was transferred to an 80 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with cleaned Ni foam substrates and heated to 120 °C for 6 h and cooled naturally to room temperature. After the Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the NiCo2(CO3)1.5(OH)3 nanowire arrays supported on the Ni foam were collected, washed several times with DI water and ethanol, and treated thermally at 400 °C for 2 h to convert them to NiCo2O4.
2.3 Fabrication of NiCo2S4 nanotube arrays
The NiCo2(CO3)1.5(OH)3 nanowire arrays supported on the Ni foam were used to prepare the NiCo2S4 nanotube arrays by an anion-exchange reaction and used directly as the electrode for supercapacitors. In a typical procedure, 8 mmol of Na2S was dissolved in 60 mL of DI water and stirred for 20 min. The solution was then transferred to an 80 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, followed by the addition of NiCo2(CO3)1.5(OH)3 supported on Ni foam. After cooling naturally to room temperature, the NiCo2S4 nanotube arrays were collected and washed with DI water and ethanol, and the sample was dried at 60 °C for 10 h.
2.4 Fabrication of NiCo2Se nanoparticles
The NiCo2Se nanoparticles on the Ni foam substrates were prepared by hydrothermally treating the as-collected NiCo2(CO3)1.5(OH)3 nanowire arrays with Se and sodium sulfite. The selenium solution was prepared by mixing Se (4 mmol) and sodium sulfite (8 mmol) in 60 mL of DI water. The resulting mixture with NiCo2(CO3)1.5(OH)3 was kept in an 80 mL stainless steel autoclave at 120 °C for 6 h and dried at 60 °C for 10 h.
2.5 Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical measurements, including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), cyclic voltammetry (CV), and galvanic charge–discharge were taken using a BioLogic potentiostat/galvanostat/EIS analyzer (SP-150, France) at room temperature. EIS was performed in a three-electrode glass cell setup and the frequency range was 500 kHz to 0.1 Hz at the open-circuit potential with an amplitude of 10 mV. The weight of the active material on the Ni foam was acquired by measuring the electrode with a microbalance with an accuracy of 0.01 mg and the weight was approximately 3 to 3.5 mg cm−2 for all electrodes. The galvanostatic charge–discharge was performed at 25 °C in 1 M KOH with different current densities, such as 5, 8.3, 11.6, 15, 20 and 23.3 A g−1. The specific capacitance of the electrode was calculated from the CV and galvanostatic discharge curves using eqn (1) and (2). (1)where I(A) is the charge or discharge current, C is the specific capacitance (F g−1), V is the scan rate of the CV curve (V s−1), m is the mass of the electrode, and (Va − Vc) represents the voltage change after a full charge or discharge. (2)where Δt (s) is the time for a full charge or discharge, ΔV is the potential drop (V), C is the specific capacitance (F g−1), and m is the mass of the electrode. The energy density (E) and power density (P) were calculated from the CV curves using the following well-known formulae: (3) (4)where C is the capacitance (F g−1), ΔV is the potential window (V), and t is the discharge time (s).
2.6 Material characterization
The product was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/Maz-2400, Rigaku), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at the Busan KBSI to identify the microstructure, surface morphology and chemical composition. The powder XRD patterns were obtained using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) and EIS were performed using an ABET technology (USA) solar simulator under 1 Sun illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G). Tafel polarization measurements were analyzed using symmetric dummy cells under dark conditions; the detailed method for the fabrication of this symmetrical cell is reported elsewhere. The surface roughness of the prepared products was explored using atomic force microscopy (JPK NanoWizard II AFM, JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany) with a scan rate of 0.8 Hz in contact mode.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization of the active material electrodes

Fig. 1 presents a schematic diagram of the synthesis process of NiCo2O4, NiCo2S4, and NiCo2Se on Ni foam via a one-step and/or two-step process. The Ni foam substrate was suitable for growing the active material electrodes using a hydrothermal method owing to its high conductivity and flexible. First, the NiCo2(CO3)1.5(OH)3 nanowire arrays were fabricated on an Ni foam substrate via a hydrothermal method. After thermal treatment of the grown NiCo2(CO3)1.5(OH)3 at 400 °C for 2 h, the NiCo2(CO3)1.5(OH)3 was converted to NiCo2O4 by dehydration. Under the next conditions, the initially prepared NiCo2(CO3)1.5(OH)3 nanowire arrays were converted hydrothermally to a NiCo2S4 hierarchical nanostructure and NiCo2Se nanotubes by reacting with a Na2S and selenium solution. When Na2S reacts with NiCo2(CO3)1.5(OH)3, the S2− ions in the solution exchange with Co32− and OH− anions to form a complete array structure of NiCo2S4 at the surface of the nanowire. The NiCo2O4 (NCO), NiCo2Se (NCSe) and NiCo2S4 (NCS) were distributed uniformly on the Ni foam without any gaps or voids, which led to a black color.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the formation process of the NiCo2O4, NiCo2Se, and NiCo2S4 films on the Ni foam substrate. 
The as-synthesized NCS on the Ni foam was confirmed by XRD and XPS. Fig. 2a shows the XRD patterns of pure NiCo2S4 and the diffraction peaks were indexed to the cubic type of NiCo2S4 (JCPDS card no. 43-1477), indicating the successful formation of the NiCo2S4 phase. The XRD patterns of NiCo2O4 and NiCo2Se are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S1). XPS was used to examine the surface species, chemical composition, and surface electronic states of NiCo2S4, and the results are presented in Fig. 2(b)–(e). As shown in the XPS survey spectrum of Fig. 2b, the S2p, C1s, O1s, Co2p, Ni2p3, and Na1s peaks originate from NiCo2S4 and the following conclusions were drawn. (1) As shown in Fig. 2e, the S2p spectrum can be divided into two main peaks, where the components at 162.6 eV and 163.3 eV were assigned to sulfur ion low coordination and a metal sulfur bond on the surface. (2) Fig. 2c and d shows the XPS spectra of Ni2p and Co2p of the NiCo2S4/Ni foam. In the Ni2p film, the two spectral curves commonly exhibited two spin–orbit characteristics of Ni2+ and Ni3+ with a shake-up satellite peak which is indicated by “Sat”. For the Ni2p curves of Fig. 2c, the peaks at 855.9 eV and 875.0 eV were indexed to Ni3+ and Ni2+. (3) Two types of Co species were observed in the high-resolution spectra of Co2p. The peak at 797.3 eV was assigned to Co2+ and Co2p1/2, whereas the peak at 781.3 eV was indexed to Co3+ and corresponds to the Co2p3/2 region.21 On the other hand, Co3+/Co2+ coexist in the NiCo2S4 film and these values matched with the Co2p and Ni2p spectra in NiCo2S4. In addition, the presence of Ni3+/Ni2+ and Co3+/Co2+ cations in the NiCo2S4 provides abundant active sites for energy storage.22,23

Fig. 3 shows HR-SEM images of the NCO, NCSe, and NCS materials deposited on Ni foam substrates. A closer examination of Fig. 3a–c showed that the NCO, NCSe, and NCS materials covered the Ni foam substrate uniformly while comprehensively perpetuating the 3D grid structure. The SEM images in Fig. 3a1 and a2 show that NCO consists of numerous slim nanowires arranged vertically on the substrates with an extremely long length of approximately 100–200 nm to form homogeneous nanowire arrays. After adding Se into the mixture, the surface morphology of NCO was altered considerably and commutated from homogeneous nanowire arrays to a nanotube like morphology. From a wide investigation, the NCSe nanowires were hollow internally and abundant pores were located on the substrate, confirming the fabrication of the nanotube arrays. The sulfide particles reacted with NiCo2(CO3)1.5(OH)3 over the entire surface (Fig. 3c1). Under the growth conditions, the NCS was entrapped uniformly with a hierarchical nanostructure and showed higher adhesion on the Ni foam substrate. The flexibility, strong adhesion and inter connected arrangement of the NCS film will enhance the electrochemical stability during charge/discharge cycling. In addition, it can provide high accessibility for electrolyte ions into the electrode to reduce the diffusive path length of the ions.

3.2 Electrochemical performances of the NCO, NCSe and NCS nanoelectrodes
To test the feasibility for pseudocapacitors, the electrochemical characteristics of the as-prepared NCO, NCSe, and NCS/Ni foam were examined by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements in a three electrode cell using Pt and Ag/AgCl as the counter and reference electrode, respectively, in a freshly prepared 1 M KOH aqueous solution. In addition, the electrochemical properties of the pure Ni foam without an electroactive material were also observed and showed extremely small area surrounded by CV curves at 50 mV s−1. The results for the pure Ni foam suggest that the specific capacitance contribution from the annealed Ni foam is negligible.17 The curves clearly show a pair of redox peaks, indicating the electrochemical performance of the electrodes resulting from pseudocapacitive behavior that occurs by the adsorption of electrolyte ions onto the surface of the electroactive materials during the reversible reaction. The distinct redox peaks in NCO, NCSe, and NCS can be attributed to the reversible redox reactions of the Co3+/Co4+, Co2+/Co3+, and Ni2+/Ni3+ transition based on the following equation.24NiCo2S4 + 2OH− = NiS4–2xOH + 2CoSxOH + 2e−CoSxOH + OH− = CoSxO + H2O + e−In the CV results, the NCS exhibited the maximum, covering the typical oxidation and reduction peaks. In addition, the CV curves of the NCS presented a much larger integral area than those of the NCO and NCSe electrodes, indicating the larger specific capacitance of the NCS electrode.

Fig. 4c shows the CV curves for the NCS electrode in the potential window of −0.1 to 0.7 V at different scan rates. With an increasing scan rate, the position of the oxidation and reduction peaks shifted, which could be due to the increase in internal resistance in the electroactive material.25 In addition, the NCS electrode exhibited no obvious deviation despite the oxidation peaks moving positively and the reduction peaks moving negatively with increasing scan rates, which is mostly interrelated to the internal resistance of the electrode. On the other hand, the specific capacitance of the device decreased with an increasing scan rate ranging from 5 to 40 mV s−1. This was attributed to the limited diffusion rate of the electrolyte and charge transfer, which is not fast enough to satisfy the electrochemical reactions of the NCS electrode material.26,27Fig. 4d shows the relationship between the anodic and cathodic peak currents as a function of the sweep rates obtained from the experimental data in Fig. 4c. These results emphasize that the anodic and cathodic peak currents show a linear dependence on the square root of the scan rate. These anodic and cathodic current values with respect to the scan rate are provided in the ESI† (Table S1). At a low scan rate, the NCS electrode performed efficiently because the ions from the KOH electrolyte have sufficient time to utilize both the outer and inner surface of the electrode. At a high scan rate, however, the area occupied by ions from KOH decreased due to a decrease in the diffusive path length.

(c) CV curves of the NCS electrode at various scan rates of 5 to 40 mV s−1, and (d) interrelationship between anodic and cathodic peak currents and scan rates for the redox peaks of the NCS electrode. 
EIS of the NCS thin film electrodes before and after 1000 cycles were also measured to provide kinetic and mechanistic information on the electroactive materials. The Nyquist plots in Fig. 5a were obtained over the frequency range of 0.1 Hz–100 kHz, in a 1 M KOH electrolyte. Both plots were semi-circular in the high frequency region and exhibited a deep-rising straight line in the low frequency region, which were related to the charge-transfer resistance and diffusion of electrolyte ions within the structure of the prepared electrodes. HR-SEM showed several accumulated sulfide particles on the external surface of the NCS/Ni foam electrode, which may increase the contact with the electrolyte. Moreover, the interaction between the NCS electrode and electrolyte is strong and the outer surface of the electrode enhances the diffusion of the electrolyte, which facilitates the interaction of NCS with the electrolyte.28 In the equivalent circuit, the internal resistance (Rs, i.e. the sum of the intrinsic resistance of the electroactive material, ionic resistance of the electrolyte, and contact resistance at the electroactive material/NCS electrode interface) was connected in series with the charge transfer resistance (Rct), Warburg impedance (Zw), and constant phase element (CPE), respectively. The size of the semi-circle, which is equal to Rct, was clearly the same for both curves (1 Ω for before and 1.2 Ω for after 1000 cycles) due to the faster electrolyte diffusion into the NCS nanowires. These lower Rct values for the NCS are favorable for efficient electrochemical properties. The slope of the straight line and Rs values were obviously lower for the NCS compared to those of previous studies, which may be caused by the slight fading of the capacitance. The EIS experimental data were also analyzed using the Bode plot to show the maximum and similar phase angle of before and after 1000 cycles for the NCS-based electrodes, which is close to the phase angle of ∼90° for ideal capacitive behavior. Based on these results, the specific capacitance of the NCS electrodes can also be calculated from the EIS data using the well-known formula (5), as follows: Csp = [1/(2πfZ′′m)] F g−1(5)where Z′′ is the imaginary value of the impedance, 2πf is the angular frequency, and m is the mass of the active material. Fig. 5c shows a schematic diagram of the as-prepared NCS on the Ni foam via an anion-exchange reaction for electrochemical energy storage. As shown in Fig. 5c, it can facilitate the rapid penetration, high surface roughness, and diffusion of OH− ions (electrolyte ions) and e− (electrons). The accumulated NCS nanowires on the Ni foam substrate increase the contact area between the active material and electrolyte ions and the good adhesion, which leads to the higher diffusion of electrolyte ions from the surface of the NCS. As a result, in the NCS electrode with a large surface area, intrinsic electrical conductivity builds up rapid pathways for electron transport, the high porosity eliminates the use of conductive additives, and the polymer binders can be favorable for binder-free high performance energy storage devices.

Fig. 6a–c show GCD curves of the NCO, NCSe and NCS thin film electrodes at a current density of 6.66 A g−1. The specific capacitance (Csp), which indicates the electrosorption rate and capacity of the sample, was calculated from the galvanostatic discharge curves using eqn (2). A significantly higher charge storage capacity with NCS (1560.81 F g−1 at 6.66 A g−1) was observed compared to that of the NCO (693.6 F g−1) and NCSe (1401.4 F g−1). In addition, the internal resistance of the NCS/Ni foam was reduced considerably compared to that of the NCO and NCSe-based film. The intended Csp decreased gradually with increasing applied current density. At a high current density, the ions that access only the outer surface are used for the charge storage due to the limited accessible time from the electrolyte while at a low current density, the ions from the electrolyte have adequate time to adsorb/desorb completely at the outer and inner surfaces of the active material.29,30 From these results, the observed Csp values were greater at a low current density (as shown in Fig. 5d) and vice versa, which shows that the electrolyte ions cannot penetrate the micropores at high current densities or high frequencies. The better supercapacitive performance of the NCS was attributed to the unique nanotube morphology and outstanding capability of the NCS electroactive material. The merits of the as-prepared NCS arrays on Ni foam are as follows: (1) The hierarchical nanostructured morphology can effectively alleviate the volume change compared to nanowires during the ion insertion/desertion process. (2) These hierarchical nanostructured materials have a much high specific surface area, resulting in improved cycling stability that can provide more electroactive sites for electrochemical storage. (3) The NCS electroactive material possesses higher conductivity than NCO and NCSe, which can facilitate a pathway for electron transport along the nanotube wall, as shown schematically in Fig. 5c. Furthermore, the NCS electrode which obtains the highest specific capacitance values even at an extremely high current density as shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI† (1066.66 F g−1 at 26.66 A g−1, 1020 F g−1 at 30 A g−1 and 1005.55 F g−1 at 33.33 A g−1) possesses the biggest specific surface area compared to the other two electrodes.

The cycling stability is another key performance that determines the practical applications of electroactive materials for supercapacitors. Fig. 6f shows the first 20 cycles for the NCS decorated on the Ni foam substrates in a 1 M KOH solution within the potential range of 0 to 0.5 V at a current density of 23.33 A g−1. As shown in Fig. 6f, the first 20 cycles exhibited a symmetrical shape and a similar time response and potential without any disparity in the cycles, which indicates a highly reversible and fast current–voltage response during the charge–discharge process. The specific capacitance of the NCS electrode increased slightly after the first cycle due to activation of the NCS electrode caused by the increased contact area between the NCS and the KOH during cycling. When a current density of 23.33 A g−1 was applied, a specific capacitance of 1165.74, 1140.87, 1101 and 1004.15 F g−1 was observed for the first, 600, 1200 and 2000 cycle, indicating a capacitance retention of 87.1% after 2000 charge discharge cycles, confirming that the NCS has an excellent cycling stability. After the cycling process, the surface morphology and the observation of Ni, Co, and S from HR-SEM were well retained. Such efficient electrodes, structural stability, and morphology can be attributed to the large surface area, strong adhesion on the substrate, and the hierarchical nature of the NCS/Ni foam.
To examine its potential as a flexible pseudocapacitive electrode, the electrochemical characteristics of the as-prepared NCS/Ni foam were investigated by CV under normal and bending conditions in a three electrode cell using a freshly-prepared 1 M KOH solution. To prepare the NCS electrode for the bending test, the NCS electrode was bent carefully up to a 180° angle. Fig. 7a and b present photographic images of the normal and bending position in the three electrode cell system. As shown in the CV curves, there was no clear change in the redox current and a negligible change was observed in the oxidation current under normal and bending conditions. This indicates that the bending of the NCS/Ni foam electrode does not influence the Faradaic redox reactions in the active material. Moreover, the specific capacitance under the normal and bending position for the NCS electrode was calculated and showed identical charge–discharge time behavior at a current density of 16.66 A g−1. As a result, the NCS on the Ni foam showed excellent mechanical stability as a flexible pseudocapacitive electrode for efficient energy storage device applications.

The corresponding supercapacitor electrode (NCS) was also analyzed in QDSSCs using a polysulfide redox electrolyte. The NICo2S4 nanotube arrays were coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates and used as a counter electrode in QDSSCs. The QDSSCs were fabricated by sandwiching a quantum-dot-sensitized TiO2 photoanode (TiO2 prepared by using the doctor-blade method, and CdS, CdSe, and ZnS sensitized on TiO2 by using the successive ionic layer absorption and reaction method) and NCS CE using a 50 μm hot melt sealing sheet (double sheet of SX 1170-25, Solaronix).31–35Fig. 8a and Table 1 present the resulting photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves and the corresponding FF, Jsc, PCE, and Voc. In previous reports, the QDSSCs with Pt, CuS, and NiS CEs showed a poor PCE of 1.64%, 2.73%, and 1.82%, respectively.9,34 The poor PCE of these CEs was attributed to (1) negative corrosion potential (−0.024 V in Tafel polarization), (2) higher anodic slope in the Tafel plot than the cathodic slope, and (3) lower exchange current density. In this study, the NCS CE in the QDSSCs showed higher Jsc values of 12.18 mA cm−2 and exhibited a better PCE of 4.56%, respectively, due to the greater catalytic activity, higher electron transport resistance through the photoanode, and lower series resistance of the cell.

Tafel polarization measurements were performed in an aqueous S2−/Sn2− redox couple solution in symmetrical dummy cells prepared with two identical CEs to examine the interfacial charge-transfer properties of the NCO, NCSe, and NCS. Fig. 8b shows the Tafel measurements of the logarithmic current density across the range of applied overpotentials: NCS > NCSe > NCO. The electrocatalytic ability of an electrode is related directly to the exchange current density (Jo) and can be calculated using eqn (4), which indicates the high electrocatalytic activity of NCS/FTO compared to the NCO and NCSe CEs toward the polysulfide reduction. The substantial progress in PCE can be elucidated from the following factors: (1) the formation of NiCo2S4 improved the catalytic activity significantly; (2) the incorporation of S2− ions via an anion-exchange reaction greatly enhanced the interface adhesion between the active material and FTO, leading to excellent mechanical and chemical stability in the S2−/Sn2− redox couple; and (3) the fabrication of NiCo2S4 with a large surface area, conductivity, and sufficient infiltration of the electrolyte into the counter electrode was found to be significant.
4. Conclusions
In summary, an NCS hierarchical nanostructure was prepared via a facile hydrothermal reaction combined with a post anion-exchange reaction for a cost-effective pseudocapacitor and as a counter electrode in quantum-dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). The hybrid electrode showed rapid electron transport, diffusion of electrolyte ions and good structural stability, which leads to excellent electrochemical characteristics due to the superior capability of the NCS electroactive material and the specific hierarchical nanostructure. The conductivity was amplified by an anion-exchange reaction with NiCo2(Co3)1.5(OH)3, which produced a very low Rs (0.93 Ω) and Rce (1.23 Ω). The QDSSCs with the NCS CE showed a higher PCE of 3.94% with a Jsc of 12.27 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.58, and FF of 0.54. This PCE is greater than the values obtained for NCO and NCSe (1.81% and 3.86%) due to its low electron transfer resistance toward the aqueous polysulfide electrolyte and large surface area. Moreover, the NCS electrode exhibited a higher specific capacitance of 1612.95 F g−1 at 5 A g−1, energy density of 56 W h kg−1, good cycling stability with only 3% loss after 1000 cycles at 6 A g−1 in a 1 M KOH electrolyte solution, and even a high capacitance of 1005.55 F g−1 at 33.33A g−1. This low-cost and facile strategy of NCS on Ni foam is desirable in applications of advanced electrochemical electrode materials for flexible electronics and energy storage applications.
