    , Accepted 9th April 2021First published on 9th April 2021AbstractIn this work, we report a two-step solvent treatment (TSST) strategy to construct high-performance all-small-molecule solar cells (all-SMSCs) without interfacial layers (IFLs), which only consist of an active layer (AL) sandwiched between two electrodes. The chlorinated ITO (ITO-Cl) anode exhibits down-shifted work functions and improved surface energy enabled by the presence of a large density of chloride ions caused by the surface chlorination of ITO. Moreover, the Al cathode shows elevated vacuum level and reduced interfacial trap density enabled by surface treatment of the active layer with polar methanol. The ITO-Cl/AL/Al-based devices form Ohmic contacts and boost the efficiency of the B1:BTP-eC9 system to 14.86%, which is higher than that of the control device (13.92%) with two IFLs. The use of this TSST strategy in the other two all-small-molecule systems is also confirmed, demonstrating its good generality. This strategy can significantly improve device stabilities, extend the life cycles of ITO substrates, and reduce modules’ production costs.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are an emerging next-generation photovoltaic technology because they can be processed from solution and deposited on flexible plastic substrates using high-throughput printing technologies. OSCs generally include an active layer with a bulk heterojunction structure sandwiched between anode and cathode electrodes. To improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE), often interfacial layers (IFLs) between the active layer and the electrodes are employed to enhance carrier extraction and also function as selective blocking layers. However, the disadvantages associated with the developed IFLs cannot be selectively ignored, which mainly include hygroscopicity, acidity or alkalinity, anisotropic charge injection, and batch-to-batch variation in electrical and physical properties. In addition, many IFLs are relatively expensive, naturally attenuate/denature and chemically react with photovoltaic materials. In this work, we demonstrated solution-processed IFL-free OSCs in which both the donor and acceptor are well-defined small molecules enabled by a two-step solvent treatment strategy. Our detailed results indicate that the TSST approach is a good generality in all-small-molecule systems and is beneficial to improve device stabilities, extend the life cycles of electrode substrates, and reduce modules’ production costs.

Introduction
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) appear to be one of the most promising photovoltaic technologies owing to their particular advantages, such as being lightweight, low-cost, colorful, and easy to mass-produce.1–7 As depicted in Fig. 1A, OSCs recently have a typical device architecture consisting of five components:1,3,8 anode and cathode electrodes, hole transporting layers (HTLs), electron transporting layers (ETLs), and an active layer (AL) with a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) structure,9 which involve mixing of donor/acceptor (D/A) photovoltaic materials.2,10 The basic working principle of OSCs is that once the photoactive layer absorbs incident light, electron–hole pairs will be generated and selectively extracted by the ETL/HTL through a driving force generated from the energy level difference. Then the free carriers are swept out from the electrodes, generating the photocurrent.5,11 In OSCs, the HTLs and ETLs play a crucial role in extracting and transporting photogenerated holes and electrons from the AL to the anode and cathode, respectively, while the HTL and ETL also function as an electron blocking layer and a hole blocking layer, respectively, and have large effects on the overall device performance of OSCs.6,12

In fact, before the five-layer device architecture, many studies initially reported OSCs without interfacial layers (IFLs).9,13–15 However, the unsuitable work function (WF, or Fermi level (EF)) difference between the two electrodes (anode and cathode) in a metal-semiconductor–metal (MSM) device restricts the charge separation and transport to collect electrodes. Also, it limits the open-circuit voltage (Voc) in MSM-type solar cells.7,16–18 To overcome these drawbacks, in 1998, Friend et al. fabricated a gold (Au) and calcium (Ca) electrode device with a high-WF poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) interfacial layer.19 In addition, Brabec et al. found that the insertion of a low-WF lithium fluoride (LiF) layer (<15 Å) at the AL/cathode interface can improve electrode properties.20,21 Consequently, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of common OSCs with the insertions of IFLs are significantly increased.16,22–24
Recently, it was found that there are obvious disadvantages in using PEDOT:PSS HTL, which includes hygroscopicity, acidity, anisotropic charge injection, and batch-to-batch variation in electrical and physical properties.25,26 In addition, the vacuum-deposited ETLs (i.e., LiF and Ca) are very sensitive to moisture and oxygen, which often results in the formation of detrimental quenching sites at the active layer/cathode interface.16,26 Researchers have focused their attention more on designing new and efficient IFL materials,17,27,28 including transition metal oxides, organic–inorganic hybrids, graphene oxides and water/alcohol-soluble organic materials, etc., and developing double or multi-layer combined IFLs.16,28 Numerous IFL materials have emerged to circumvent the problems of PEDOT:PSS and LiF layers, and further modify the active layer/electrode interfaces.7,12,27–30 However, the disadvantages associated with these promising IFLs cannot be selectively ignored. For instance, the deposited metal oxides generally show high-temperature processing conditions and poor repeatability.7,31 Many IFL materials are relatively expensive, naturally attenuate/denature and chemically react with photovoltaic materials.10,12,22,32 Based on this review, finding new processing methods, instead of developing alternative interlayer materials for fabricating high-performance OSCs, should also be one of the leading research hotspots of OSCs, which may reduce the efficiency-stability-cost gap and facilitate the commercialization of OSC technology.
In this work, we demonstrated solution-processed high-performance IFL-free all-small-molecule solar cells (all-SMSCs) with a simple MSM-type structure enabled by a two-step solvent treatment (TSST) strategy (Fig. 1B). The surface of indium tin oxide (ITO) was treated with chlorobenzene (CB) in combination with a UV-ozone treatment for forming a chlorinated ITO anode with a down-shifted work function and an improved surface energy. Furthermore, methanol was chosen as a polar solvent to treat the investigated all-small-molecule active layer containing the donor material with full name (B1, (5Z,5′Z)-5,5′-(((4,8-bis(4-((2-ethylhexyl)thio)phenyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(3′,3′′-dihexyl-[2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene]-5′′,5 diyl))bis(methanylylidene))bis(3-butyl-4-thioxothiazolidin-2-one)33) and the acceptor material with full name (BTP-eC9, 2,2′-[[12,13-bis(2-butyloctyl)-12,13-dihydro-3,9-dinonylbisthieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-e:2′,3′-g][2,1,3]benzothiadiazole-2,10-diyl]bis[methylidyne(5,6-chloro-3-oxo-1H-indene-2,1(3H)-diylidene)]]bis[propanedinitrile]34) (the molecular structure shown in Fig. 1C). This TSST strategy overcomes the mismatch of the work functions of the electrodes with the energy levels of either D or A in the BHJ composite, which results in an increase in built-in voltage across the device and a reduction of interfacial trap density at the corresponding blend/Al interface. The ITO-Cl/active layer/Al-based devices form Ohmic contacts and boost the efficiency of the B1:BTP-eC9 system to 14.86%, which is higher than that of the control device (13.92%) with two IFLs. What is more, we also demonstrated that this TSST approach shows a good generality in all-small-molecule systems and is beneficial to improve the storage stability and operational stability of all-SMSCs.
Results and discussion
In contrast to the traditional device structure with two IFLs, the proposed structure has only three layers, an active layer, ITO anode, and Al cathode (Fig. 1A). For comparison purposes, conventional OSCs with a device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/B1: BTP-eC9 active layer/PFN-Br/Al were constructed. The schematic illustrates the MSM-type device fabrication procedures via the step-by-step optimization strategy investigated in this study. Details of the control and MSM-type device fabrication processes are described in the ESI.† To fabricate the MSM-type OSC, we placed bare ITO-substrates in a closed Petri dish with CB solvent and treated them with UV radiation as a function of time (see Experimental section for details). As a result, Cl radicals liberated from the CB solvent displaced oxygen on the ITO substrates’ surface, which can effectively modify the WF and surface energy of the ITO electrode. The deposited B1:BTP-eC9 BHJ blends were further treated with methanol solvent, which can change the contact properties between the active layer and the Al cathode.35

Fig. 1D exhibits the optical transmittance of the ITO samples without and with surface chlorination treatments. The transmittance spectra of the ITO and chlorinated ITO (ITO-Cl) electrodes are unchanged in the wavelength range of 300–1100 nm, indicating that both of the electrodes would allow similar photon flux to reach the active layer to generate carriers. In addition, replacing the ITO/PEDOT:PSS with ITO-Cl can achieve higher transmittance in the optical range of approximately 500–1100 nm for anode-based substrates. It is wirth noting that the ITO-Cl electrodes’ surface roughness values are also comparable with that of the ITO electrode (Fig. S1, ESI†), and are higher than that of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS layer. To determine the distribution and effects of Cl atoms, the surface composition and work function of the CB-treated ITO electrode were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements, respectively. The Cl 2p peak at about 200 eV (Fig. 1E) as a function of increasing UV treatment time from 0 to 20 min monotonically shifted to higher intensity, indicating an increase in the surface coverage of Cl atoms. Note that the Cl 2p core levels of ITO-Cl and InCl3 are identical,36 illustrating that the Cl atoms are bonded to In at the surface. Since there is a large difference in electronegativity between In (1.78) and Cl (3.16), the In–Cl bonds are polar. In other words, the chlorinated ITO electrode is equivalent to introducing a layer of dipoles across the ITO surface. In particular, the surface dipole induced by charge rearrangement was responsible for the upward shift of the vacuum level and the subsequent increase in the WF. The secondary electron cut-off of ITO-Cl (Fig. 1F) shifted to lower binding energy with treatment time, indicating an increase in work function. This is further demonstrated by the Kelvin probe technique (Fig. 1G, top). For the highest Cl surface coverage, corresponding to a treatment time of 20 min, the WF increases from the reference value of ∼4.7 eV to 5.2 eV, resulting from the dipoles, which would increase the electrostatic potential energy just outside the surface. The increment in work function, close to that of PEDOT:PSS (a WF of 5.1 eV), is favorable to enhance the hole extraction at the ITO-Cl/AL interface.
To directly verify the corresponding electrodes’ wettability and conductivity, we performed surface energy and resistance measurements. The contact angels (θs) of water and ethylene glycol on the ITO-Cl substrates as a function of treatment time were tested to compare the surface energies of the corresponding electrodes experimentally.37 The surface energy of each sample calculated from the relevant photographs (Fig. S2, ESI†) is shown in Table S1 (ESI†) and summarized in Fig. 1G (bottom). As the UV irradiation time increases from 0 to 20 min, the surface energy of the ITO-Cl samples undergoes a monotonic improvement. The highest surface energy is found at 20 min of UV treatment with over 121.0 mJ m−2, which is comparable with that of the neat PEDOT:PSS layer (120.0 mJ m−2), but is higher than that of the bare ITO sample (104.5 mJ m−2). In addition, the sheet resistances of the ITO samples were all unchanged (Fig. S3, ESI†), indicating that the influence of surface chlorination treatment on the electrical conductivity of the ITO electrode is negligible.
To investigate the modification of methanol treatment on the surface morphology of B1:BTP-eC9 blends, we directly examined the surface morphology by atomic force microscopy (AFM), the surface composition by XPS, and the surface potential by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). On the one hand, our results show that methanol treatment causes no noticeable change in surface morphology and film roughness of the B1:BTP-eC9 blends coated on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS bilayer (Fig. 1H) and ITO-Cl layer (Fig. 1I) without and with methanol treatment, respectively. On the other hand, there is also no observable difference in the surface morphologies of the blends coated on ITO/PEDOT:PSS and ITO-Cl films. Moreover, XPS results (Fig. S4, ESI†) show similar elemental composition on B1:BTP-eC9 surfaces without and with methanol treatment, indicating that the effect of methanol treatment on the surface chemical composition of the blends is negligible, though KPFM measurements of the surface of B1:BTP-eC9 blends exhibit a 28 ± 5 mV shift in average surface potential occurring after methanol treatment (Fig. 1J), probably resulting from the charge of surface electronic states after methanol treatment. It is therefore seen that the vacuum level of the cathode at the organic/electrode interface is correspondingly elevated by 28 ± 5 mV only by methanol treatment. Notably, these results in terms of the effects of methanol treatment on the blend surface are in agreement with the previous report in the fullerene-based polymer solar cells.35 Furthermore, Heeger et al. also demonstrated that methanol treatment can also passivate surface traps of the methanol-treated active layer.35 Based on these findings, it can be concluded that this TSSA strategy enables the WF change of the electrodes by forming net dipoles at the organic/electrode interfaces. Thus, the energy level diagram of each component in a MSM-type device can be depicted in Fig. S5 (ESI†), which illustrates the electrical contact shifting and vacuum level shift of the ITO-Cl anode and Al cathode.
To demonstrate the benefits of the tunable WFs of the step-by-step treatments using CB and methanol solvents for OSC fabrication, we have made five structures of devices: a five-layer control structure with two IFLs, an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/methanol-treated AL/Al structure, ITO-Cl based MSM structures without and with methanol treatment, and a bare ITO/AL/Al structure. Fig. 2A exhibits the current–density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of the corresponding B1:BTP-eC9 all-SMSCs with and without solvent treatments, measured under AM 1.5G illumination. The key photovoltaic parameters of the all-SMSCs are listed in Table 1. The control B1:BTP-eC9 device in which PEDOT:PSS and PFN-Br are used as the anode and cathode IFLs shows a Voc of 0.833 V, a Jsc of 23.81 mA cm−2, a FF of 70.21% and a high PCE of 13.92%. After removing the PEDOT:PSS and PFN-Br layers, all the photovoltaic parameters of the bare ITO/AL/Al device without IFLs are reduced significantly, yielding an approximately 60% decrease in PCE as compared to that of the control device with IFLs. In addition, the corresponding PCE of the IFL-free device can be enhanced to 11.53%, resulting from the modified WF and surface energy of the surface chlorinated ITO anode. Although the ITO-Cl-based device without IFLs exhibits a slightly higher Jsc of 24.09 mA cm−2 as compared to that of the control device (a Jsc of 23.81 mA cm−2), its contact-related Voc and FF losses (0.777 V vs. 0.833 V and 61.87% vs. 70.21%, respectively) indicate the unsatisfactory quasi-Ohmic cathode contact for efficient electron extraction and hole blocking, mainly resulting from the reduced built-in potential (Vbi) due to interfacial band bending, as confirmed by KPFM measurement (Fig. 1J).

To improve the interface between the active layer and the Al cathode, we used a reported methanol treatment method to realize its quasi-Ohmic cathode contact.33 As a result, a higher PCE of 14.86% was achieved in the optimized MSM-type devices by using an ITO-Cl anode and Al cathode with methanol treatment of the active layer (Fig. 1B), compared with a PCE of 13.92% obtained for the control device. Notably, the J–V curves of the MSM-type devices as a function of blend thickness determined by the spinning speed are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†) and the corresponding photovoltaic paramters are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). As exhibited in Table 1, the comparable Voc and FF values adequately confirmed the formation of quasi-Ohmic contacts at both electrodes in the optimized MSM-type device, indicating the positive effect of methanol treatment on device performance improvement. To further investigate the effect of methanol treatment on the blend surface, we fabricated the relevant solar cells with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/methanol-treated AL/Al. As shown in Fig. 2A and Table 1, the corresponding device performance of the above-mentioned devices is comparable to the photovoltaic results of the five-layer control devices, but is much higher than those of the ITO-Cl/AL/Al-based solar cells, especially in terms of Voc and FF values (0.828 V vs. 0.777 V and 70.69% vs. 61.87%, respectively). This result further demonstrated that the effects of methanol treatment on the enhancement of device performance can be attributed to an increase in built-in voltage across the methanol-treated device due to a corresponding increase of surface charge density and passivation of surface traps.35
We manufactured large-area devices with an active area of 1 cm2 (1 × 1 cm). The better performance of the MSM device reached a PCE of 12.88% compared to that of the control devices (12.29% PCE, Fig. S7, ESI† and Table 1), mainly attributed to different Jsc values (23.43 mA cm−2 for the control device and 24.22 mA cm−2 for the MSM device). Moreover, we further fabricated the MSM devices in two different research groups to confirm the reproduction of these results, namely, Zhou Yinhua's group and Wang Tao's group. The J–V characteristics are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†) and the key photovoltaic parameters of the OSCs are listed in Table 1.
Notably, with the increase of UV treatment time of the ITO substrates, the PCEs of the MSM devices gradually increased first and then decreased as the surface chlorination time exceeded 15 min (Fig. S9 and Table S3, ESI†). Another interesting phenomenon that should be highlighted is that the Jsc values of the optimized MSM-type solar cells with various active areas were also increased, which is directly demonstrated by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves provided in Fig. 2B. The slightly higher Jsc values may be attributed to enhanced photo harvesting of the active layers, as will be discussed below. Fig. 2C further presents the statistical photovoltaic metrics and PCE histograms obtained from relevant control and MSM devices, which indicate the good reproducibility of the photovoltaic performance of the B1:BTP-eC9 all-SMSCs.
To clarify the morphological characteristics of the control and MSM devices (especially for active layers), we applied scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and in situ measuring film-depth-dependent light absorption spectroscopy (FLAS). The cross-sectional TEM images of the control and MSM devices are demonstrated in Fig. 2D and E, respectively. The energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) elemental maps (Cl, S, In, and Al) of the cross-sections also confirm a well-organized layer stack. In addition, to investigate the kinetically vertically-resolved miscibility and vertical phase separation in the corresponding active layers coated on the ITO/PEDOT:PSS and ITO-Cl substrates, the FLAS measurements are conducted, as shown in Fig. 2F and G, respectively. Here β is self-defined as follows:  where n is the number of sublayers, and a and bi are the ratios of the D/A absorbance at the characteristic absorption wavelengths of the whole film and sublayer, respectively.38 The β values were 0.71 for the control sample and 0.04 for the MSM sample, illustrating good phase miscibility in these two types of active layers coated on different anodes, also demonstrated by the AFM surface images of the corresponding active layers (Fig. 1G and H). In particular, we quantitatively monitored the vertical profiles of each component across the whole thickness of the relevant active layers (Fig. S10A for the control sample and Fig. S10B for the MSM sample, ESI†). As compared to the control active layer, we can easily find that the B1 donors were slightly assembled at the bottom of the active layer coated on the ITO-Cl substrate. The BTP-eC9 acceptors were slightly enriched at the surface of the active layer treated by methanol solvent.
To understand the performance difference in the control and MSM-type devices, we firstly analyzed the optical properties of the corresponding active layers (Fig. 3A). The ITO-Cl/AL sample shows a slightly higher visible absorption spectrum in the spectral range of 450–650 nm, as compared with that of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/AL sample. In addition, Fig. 3B and C show the field distribution for the wavelength range of 300–900 nm for visualizing the modulation of the electric field inside control and MSM devices with the AL thickness of 110 nm, respectively. The stronger photo-absorption rate profile of the MSM device as compared to that of the control device indicates that more photons can be absorbed (especially in the spectral range in 450–650 nm) and converted into energy.39 Of note is that those two images can also be viewed as the charge generation profiles within the control and MSM devices because most of the excitons can be separated into free charges, demonstrated by the photoluminescence (PL) tests (Fig. S11, ESI†). Besides, the charge dissociation probability P(E,T) (Fig. S12, ESI†), which is defined as Jph/Jsat under short-circuit conditions (where Jph is photogenerated current density and Jsat represents the saturation photocurrent density), is 91.91% for the control device, and the value for the MSM device is 92.08%. Thus, the slightly higher Jsc in the MSM-type device is probably attributed to the increased absorption spectra in the short wavelength range (Fig. 3A and C) and better charge dissociation probability, which is directly demonstrated by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves (Fig. 2B).

(B and C) Simulated photo-absorption rates in control (B) and MSM-type (C) devices with an AL thickness of 110 nm. (D) The J–V characteristics recorded in the dark for the control and MSM devices on a logarithmic scale. (E) Hole-only mobility measured in single carrier diodes based on ITO/PEDOT:PSS and ITO-Cl anodes; carrier mobility of control and MSM-type devices calculated from photo-CELIV measurements. (F) Normalized TPC data for the control and MSM-type devices. The illumination pulse intensity was 150 mW cm−2 (light pulse of 50 μs). 
Additionally, the J–V characteristics of the corresponding devices in the dark show a slightly larger rectification ratio, and thus a better diode quality for the MSM device as compared to that of the control device (Fig. 3D). To explain this phenomenon, the hole-only mobilities of the relevant diodes are further measured. Based on the space- charge-limited current (SCLC) model,8 the transformed J–V curves to be used to calculate hole mobility (μh) with the modified Mott–Gurney law are shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†). By fitting the curves linearly, the average μh values (Table S4, ESI†) are calculated as 3.69 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the control sample with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/AL/MoO3/Ag and 3.90 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the MSM sample with a device structure of ITO-Cl/AL/MoO3/Ag, respectively. In addition, the average mobility of the actual MSM device (5.84 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), calculated by photo-induced charge carrier extraction by linearly increasing the voltage (photo-CELIV) technique (Fig. S14 and Table S4, ESI†), is also higher than that of the control device (5.24 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), further indicating that charge carriers can be transmitted more effectively in a real MSM device. We also conducted transient photocurrent measurements to investigate the charge extraction (CE) property in the devices. As provided in Fig. 3F, the CE time is 0.35 μs for the control device and 0.31 μs for the MSM device, respectively, indicating the more effective carrier extraction in the MSM device. Of particular note is that the charge carrier density (n) of the MSM device (3.62 × 1016 cm−3), achieved by CE measurements (Fig. S15, ESI†), is also higher than that (3.49 × 1016 cm−3) of the control device (Table S3, ESI†). Apart from the better optical property in the MSM system resulting in a higher n, it also implies that the MSM device structure effectively avoids the density of traps between the active layer and Al contact, and hence defect or trap-assisted interface recombination is suppressed, which was demonstrated by measuring Voc as a function of light intensity (Fig. S16, ESI†).
This TSST strategy can be considered a universal method for solution-processed all-SMSCs with a simple MSM device architecture without IFLs, further demonstrated by optimizing the other two photovoltaic systems (Fig. S17, ESI†), including BTR-Cl:Y6,40 and B1:Y6. The J–V curves of their devices are provided in Fig. 4A and B, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The PCE of the BTR-Cl:Y6 system improves from 13.31% for the control device to 13.88% for the MSM device (Fig. 4A); the PCE of the B1:Y6 system improves from 12.32% for the control device to 12.76% for the MSM device (Fig. 4B). All the simple MSM devices exhibited higher PCE values than those of relevant control devices, mainly resulting from the higher Jsc values in MSM devices, which are associated with the EQE measurements (Fig. S18 and S19, ESI†).

Device stability is also crucial in the implementation of OSC technology. Thus, we also measured the performance parameters of the control and MSM devices to probe the influence of device structure modification on all-SMSC stabilities. Fig. 4D depicts the degradation trends of normalized PCE over aging time for 200 hours for relevant control and MSM devices based on the investigated four photovoltaic systems, which were stored in the dark or operated under one sun illumination in a nitrogen glovebox, respectively. After storing at room temperature in N2 for 200 hours (Fig. S20, ESI†), the average PCE of the B1:BTP-eC9 MSM device decays 30.77% (99.38% for control device); the average PCE of the BTR-Cl:Y6 MSM device decays 44.38% (98.13% for control device); the average PCE of the B1:Y6 MSM device decays 22.80% (97.53% for control device), respectively. In addition, the corresponding MSM devices also show significantly improved photostability properties (Fig. S21, ESI†): the average PCEs of these three systems decay 59.8% for the B1:BTP-eC9 MSM device, 64.6% for the BTR-Cl:Y6 MSM device, and 60.0% for the B1:Y6 MSM device; in contrast the average PCEs of the corresponding control devices decay 93.2%, 95.8%, and 97.5%, respectively. These results indicate that the MSM device structure without IFLs can improve the storage and light stability of these non-fullerene blends, mainly due to the removal of the possible attenuation of interface materials, active layer/IFL interfaces and/or electrode/IFL interfaces. However, we found that the MSM-based devices are still not stable enough, probably resulting from the intrinsic properties of small molecules, which include weak thermal phase transition temperatures (or glass transition temperatures) and thus vulnerability to thermal and photo stresses.41–43 Overall, our results highlight the influence of device structure on operational stability and demonstrate the advantages of this MSM architecture for improving device performance.
To compare the reuse performance of electrode substrates of degraded and/or abandoned control and MSM devices, which is one of the most critical schemes to reduce the cost, we investigated the effects of recycled ITO on the photovoltaic performance of the B1:BTP-eC9 solar cells. The procedure for cleaning the ITO surface from the fabricated OSCs is depicted in Fig. S22 (ESI†) and inserted simply into Fig. 4E. After five cycles of testing, it was found that the recycled ITO-Cl substrate can be applied in the fabrication of new OSCs, and a slightly lower PCE (13.28%) of the MSM device based on the B1:BTP-eC9 system has been demonstrated (Fig. S23 and Table S5, ESI†), compared to that with the original ITO-Cl (14.86%). Notably, the PCE of the control device obviously reduced when the ITO substrate was reused (Fig. S24 and Table S6, ESI†), probably caused by the etching of ITO due to the acidity of PEDOT:PSS.25,26 Thus, reuse of the ITO-Cl substrate demonstrated in this work can efficiently enhance the end-of-life management of abandoned solar cells based on a simple MSM architecture and improve the overall life cycle of the solar cells for low-cost OSC applications.
Apart from the low life cycles of the ITO substrate, each additional IFL in the control devices can dramatically contribute to increasing the production costs of commercial OSCs. Here we further provide the minimum sustainable price (MSM) analysis of our investigated control single solar module (control-SSM) and MSM single solar module (MSM-SSM) (Fig. 4F). The calculated MSPs for possible solar modules are depicted in Fig. S25–S27 (ESI†) and summarized in Tables S7–S10 (ESI†), which are adopted from our previous work.44 The detailed descriptions of MSP analysis are provided in Supplemental Note 1 (ESI†). The calculated MSP value of the MSM-type solar module with a predicted PCE of 10% is 0.375 $Wp−1 (∼2.45 ¥Wp−1, at an exchange rate of 6.537), which is much cheaper than the control device module with the same module efficiency (0.464 $Wp−1). This result is attributed to the reduced cost of interfacial materials and constructions, shortened processing steps, power costs, etc.44 Overall, this developed MSM-type structure possesses excellent advantages of replacing the five-layer control device structure applied in the industrial scenarios.
Conclusion
In summary, based on the modified electrodes with suitable WFs enabled by solvent treatments, a simple MSM device structure is developed, which matches well with the all-small-molecule systems, and thus can avoid the requirements of IFLs in all-SMSCs. Benefiting from the effects of the combined surface chlorination and methanol treatment strategy on the anode and cathode electrodes, respectively, this MSM device structure exhibits unique advantages of combining the merits of higher photoabsorption rate, more suitable blend morphology, and better charge transport, extraction and collection properties, etc., endowing the IFL-free MSM devices with a higher PCE of 14.86% compared to the control devices (13.92%). The other two all-SM systems (BTR-Cl:Y6 and B1:Y6) further demonstrated the remarkable universality of this MSM device architecture constructed by the TSST strategy. What is more, as compared to the control devices, higher storage stability and operational stability can be found in the corresponding MSM-type devices. More importantly, using a simple MSM structure instead of the IFL-based control device structure can further improve the end-of-life performance of the electrode substrate and reduce the manufacturing costs, which play a crucial role in industrial scenarios. Overall, our result indicates that modifying the active layer/electrode contacts via a TSST strategy is a feasible and general approach to improve the device performance in all-SMSCs.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are an emerging next-generation photovoltaic technology because they can be processed from solution and deposited on flexible plastic substrates using high-throughput printing technologies. OSCs generally include an active layer with a bulk heterojunction structure sandwiched between anode and cathode electrodes. To improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE), often interfacial layers (IFLs) between the active layer and the electrodes are employed to enhance carrier extraction and also function as selective blocking layers. However, the disadvantages associated with the developed IFLs cannot be selectively ignored, which mainly include hygroscopicity, acidity or alkalinity, anisotropic charge injection, and batch-to-batch variation in electrical and physical properties. In addition, many IFLs are relatively expensive, naturally attenuate/denature and chemically react with photovoltaic materials. In this work, we demonstrated solution-processed IFL-free OSCs in which both the donor and acceptor are well-defined small molecules enabled by a two-step solvent treatment strategy. Our detailed results indicate that the TSST approach is a good generality in all-small-molecule systems and is beneficial to improve device stabilities, extend the life cycles of electrode substrates, and reduce modules’ production costs.
