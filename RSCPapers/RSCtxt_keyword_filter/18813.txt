    , Accepted 4th July 2020First published on 6th July 2020AbstractFour tetraphenylethylene-bridged X-shaped photosensitizers JY66–69 containing one triphenylamine (TPA) donor and another donor TPA, carbazole, phenothiazine or dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) as the neighboring donor were designed and applied in dye-sensitized solar cells. Compared with the symmetrical twin TPA-based dye JY66, the introduction of carbazole or phenothiazine neighboring donor (JY67/JY68) causes a promotion in the dipole moment of the sensitizer, while dye JY69 with DTP as a neighboring donor inversely results in a decrease. Besides the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC) rising together with dipole moment, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) displays near linear positive correlation to the vertical dipole moment (μnormal) in this series. Finally, dye JY67 containing TPA and carbazole donor achieves the best photovoltaic performance. Accordingly, decorating such an X-shaped bridge with hetero-donors would be a promising strategy to improve the performance of multi-branched dyes in DSSCs.
1. Introduction
Over the last three decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as an advanced technology converting solar energy to electricity have drawn much attention owing to low cost, easy fabrication and remarkable efficiency.1–3 Photosensitizers as one of the main components in DSSCs have been well explored. In comparison to metal- and porphyrin-based dyes, metal-free organic dyes have induced more attention due to flexible modification and environmental friendliness.4–9 Typical organic sensitizers in DSSCs generally feature a D–π–A conjugated system, where intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from donor to acceptor via π-spacer after photo-induced excitation can be facilitated. Besides the rod-like D–π–A structure, multi-branched systems such as D–(π–A)2, X-/Y-shaped and other nonlinear frameworks containing multi-donors and/or multi-acceptors have also become promising candidates for DSSCs with excellent performance.10,11
Compared with linear dyes with mono-acceptor, multi-branched sensitizers are generally regarded as an effective structure to boost the photovoltaic performance by the extra electron injection channel and enhanced binding ability on the TiO2 surface.12–16 However, multi-anchored dyes often have to face the poor open-circuit voltage (VOC) partially resulting from the down-shifted Fermi level of TiO2 caused by more proton release, in addition to unfavorable dye stacking and charge recombination.17–19 To pursue a better performance in a multi-branched system, many strategies have been developed, such as building a three-dimensional framework with rigid linkage to suppress the intermolecular π–π stacking in aggregation,20,21 incorporating bulky substituents to protect the main skeleton from the charge recombination at the electrolyte/dye/TiO2 interface,22 and constructing a non-conjugated system where two segments are linked by a flexible alkyl chain to raise the dye coverage on a semiconductor surface.23,24 Accordingly, constructing steric skeletons in multi-branched dyes would be an effective way to counter the drawbacks. Tetraphenylthene (TPE) entities are widely used in aggregation-induced emission (AIE) materials due to the special three dimensional configuration built by multiple C–H⋯π interactions between phenyl rings in adjacent molecules as well as the resulting significant hindrance to intermolecular π–π stacking in aggregation state.25,26 Su and co-workers have built up X-shaped dyes with a TPE unit as the π-spacer and confirmed that the TPE-based sensitizers could maintain the anti-stacking configuration in aggregation and the unnecessary fluorescence emission and energy loss was avoided by strong electron-withdrawing acrylic acid group.27 Recently, Lin and co-workers found that the distorted TPE-tethered phenothiazine-based di-anchored dye can suppress charge recombination in electrolytes more efficiently than the simple phenyl ring-shielded counterpart.28 In other words, introducing a TPE unit to the multi-branched sensitizers could be a competitive strategy to improve the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.
To make full use of the advantages of the TPE core, a further design principle for multi-branched sensitizers should also be taken into account. It is noteworthy that some asymmetrical multi-branched dyes with discrepant donors/π-spacers or even acceptors have shown better performance than the mono or symmetrical opponents in certain series.29–32 On the other hand, the photovoltaic properties in special multi-donor sensitizers (e.g., D–D′–π–A and T-shaped dyes) could also be tuned by using a hetero-donors strategy.33–36 These facts provide insight into the way to modify the TPE core which holds flexible decoration sites. Among numerous electron donors for sensitizers, triphenylamine (TPA) groups keeping a propeller-like configuration could present a considerable ability to suppress charge recombination and thus achieve remarkable application in sensitizer design.37–41 Totally speaking, it would be promising to construct TPE-based dyes with hetero-donors consisting of TPA and another donor for dyes in DSSCs.
In this paper, four X-shaped dyes featuring a TPE unit as the π-spacer and TPA as one donor have been designed and synthesized (Fig. 1). Planar carbazole, butterfly-like phenothiazine and sulfur-rich dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) have been selected as the neighboring donors to build asymmetrical dyes JY67–69, respectively. In addition, symmetrical reference JY66 containing twin TPA donors was also prepared to interpret the hetero-donor effect on the photovoltaic performance.

2. Experiments
2.1. Materials and instruments
All the synthesis reactions were processed under an argon atmosphere. Solvents for synthesis and DSSCs fabrication were purified according to the general methods before use. The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer. The chemical shifts were measured with TMS as the internal standard. HR-MS data were afforded using a Varian 7.0T FTMS. UV-Vis spectra were obtained using a Varian Cary 300 Conc UV-Visible spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry, J–V curves and EIS analysis were conducted on a Zennium electrochemical workstation (Zahner Corporation).
2.2. Fabrication and characterization of DSSCs
The photoanodes were fabricated by screen printing the TiO2 paste (Heptachroma Corporation) onto FTO conductive glass (Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan, 15 Ω sq−1). A transparent layer was manufactured with 20 nm nanoparticles, and a scattering layer was formed with 200 nm nanoparticles. The active area of the target film was 0.196 cm2. Afterwards, the photoanodes were sintered gradually to 500 °C and held for 40 min at that temperature. After cooling down to room temperature, the resultant photoanodes were post-treated in a TiCl4 aqueous solution (40 mM) at 70 °C for 30 min, then heated again at 500 °C for another 40 min. At last, the obtained photoanodes were sensitized in a 0.3 mM dye solution (THF as the solvent) for 12 h at room temperature and under dark conditions. The 0.02 M H2PtCl6 in isopropanol solution was spin-coated onto the FTO conductive glass to afford the Pt electrodes, and the electrodes were sintered at 400 °C for 30 min. The iodine electrolytes consisted of 0.6 M 1-propy-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.1 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M GuSCN and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile/valeronitrile (v/v = 85/15). The DSSCs were illuminated under a solar simulator (CHF-XM-500 W, Trusttech Co. Ltd) under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation calibrated by a standard silicon solar cell (91150V, Newport Corporation). The IPCE was detected using a commercial setup (QTest Station 2000 IPCE Measurement System, CROWNTECH, USA).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis
The synthetic routes of four TPE-based dyes are shown in Scheme 1. All aryl ketones 1–4 were prepared from bis(4-bromophenyl)methanone. One and two Suzuki couplings were carried out to yield symmetric 1 and asymmetric 2/3, respectively. For ketone 4, Stille coupling was applied to replace the second Suzuki coupling. Details of the above synthesis procedures are given in the ESI.† Afterwards, McMurry reactions of these resultant diaryl methanones with bis(4-bromophenyl)methanone were successively carried out to afford the X-shaped brominated precursors 5–8, respectively. Further transformation was completed by reacting them with 5-formylthiophen-2-yl-boronic acid through Suzuki reaction to form aldehydes 9–12. Finally, Knoevenagel condensations were conducted with cyanoacetic acid to give the target dyes JY66–69.

3.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the dyes JY66–69 in THF solutions and on TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 2 and the corresponding optical and electrochemical properties are summarized in Table 1. In THF solution, dyes JY66–68 display two transparent absorption bands. The high energy absorption band lying around 350 nm can be assigned to π–π* transition absorption, while the low energy absorption band locating around 420 nm can be attributed to ICT transition rising from donors to the electron-withdrawing cyanoarylic acid (417 nm for JY66, 423 nm for JY67, 418 nm for JY68, respectively). In particular dye JY69 containing DTP as the neighboring donor only exhibits a single broad absorption band peaking at 387 nm, which might be caused by the overlap between two characteristic transition absorptions. After being absorbed onto TiO2 films, all the di-anchored dyes JY66–69 present a wide absorption band with nearly the same maximum wavelength, suggesting that substituting one of the TPA donors in symmetrical dye JY66 with the other donors causes no obvious alteration on the ICT process, in spite of a slightly broader band observed in JY69. After all, the spectral onsets on TiO2 films bathochromically shift by approximately 50 nm compared with that in THF solutions, which would be beneficial for light harvesting of the sensitizers in DSSCs.

Electrochemical properties of dye-sensitized TiO2 films were conducted by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and calibrated with ferrocene (0.63 V vs. NHE) in acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6, 0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte (Fig. S1, ESI†). The schematic energy levels and gaps for JY66–69 are shown in Fig. 3. All the X-shaped dyes exhibit comparable first oxidation potentials relating to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) at around 1.15 V, demonstrating that hetero di-donor groups in dyes JY67–69 would have a similar electron-donating ability as the symmetrical counterpart dye JY66. In addition, the band gaps of the dyes were measured from the Tauc plot in THF (Fig. S2, ESI†), and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels calculated from Ered = Eox − Egap also present unobvious discrepancy (−1.44, −1.50, −1.46 and −1.44 V for JY66, JY67, JY68 and JY69, respectively). After all, both the HOMOs and LUMOs of the four dyes fall in alignment with the requirements of effective dye regeneration by iodine redox couples (0.4 V vs. NHE) and sufficient electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band (−0.5 V vs. NHE).

3.3. Theoretical calculations
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted on the level of B3LYP/6-31G* to have a full sight of the optimized geometry and electronic contributions of dyes JY66–69. As shown in Fig. 4, a high co-planarity is observed between the neighboring donor and the central olefin plane in asymmetrical DTP-contained dye JY69 with the dihedral angle of 11.4°. In contrast, the carbazole/phenothiazine in dyes JY67/JY68 induces an enlarged distortion between the neighboring side and the central ethylene core, forming a scissors-like configuration. Initially, the total dipole moments of these X-shaped dyes witness a sharp increase in the order of JY69 < JY66 < JY68 < JY67, suggesting the introduced neighboring donor-like carbazole or phenothiazine can bring in more efficient charge separation in the whole molecule compared with the original twin-TPA reference JY66. It is notable that the dipole orientation stands almost along the central olefin bond in symmetrical dye JY66, but inclines to the neighboring donors in all other asymmetrical systems. After being absorbed onto the semiconductor, the vertical dipole moment (μnormal) could be considered approximately parallel with the ethylene bond of the TPE π-spacer. Consequently, the μnormal still meet an elevation in the same order of total dipole moments together with a comparable magnitude in the symmetrical dye JY66 and asymmetrical phenothiazine-contained dye JY68 (5.36 D for JY66, 9.26 D for JY67, 6.38 D for JY68 and 1.90 D for JY69, respectively).

The frontier molecular orbitals of the four dyes are displayed in Fig. 5. The HOMOs and HOMO−1s were uniformly localized on the di-donor parts in both the twin TPA-donated dye JY66 and DTP-contained dye JY69. However, regarding asymmetrical dyes JY67 and JY68 containing carbazole and phenothiazine respectively, the HOMOs mainly focused on the TPA donor while the HOMO−1 diffused more on the neighboring donor rings. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT)42,43 calculations (Table S1, ESI†) demonstrate that the HOMO-to-LUMO transition should be the main composition for the ICT process. As a consequence, the TPA donor may play a more dominant role than the carbazole/phenothiazine neighboring donor in JY67/JY68, and result in a similar ICT absorption. Meanwhile, the partial participation of the DTP neighboring donor in the HOMO of JY69 may induce a slight bathochromic shift in the absorption spectra. After all, such electronic distribution in sensitizers would be favorable for the charge transfer from the excited dyes to the TiO2 conduction band.

3.4. Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performance characteristics of DSSCs based on dyes JY66–69 were measured under standard AM 1.5G illumination, 100 mW cm−2. The related photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves are plotted in Fig. 6a, and detailed photovoltaic data are collected in Table 2. First of all, the VOC of these X-shaped dyes experience an increasing tendency in the order of JY69 < JY66 < JY68 < JY67. Specifically, the asymmetrical carbazole- and phenothiazine-contained sensitizers JY67 and JY68 (712 and 710 mV, respectively) only exhibit slightly higher VOC than symmetrical twin-TPA donated dye JY66 (694 mV) but significantly beyond that of the DTP-contained JY69 (610 mV). The same order as VOC has been observed for the short-circuit current densities (JSC), where the asymmetrical carbazole-contained dye JY67 shows a superior JSC in comparison to the other three analogues. It is notable that the increasing order of both VOC and JSC fall in alignment with the promoting sequence of corresponding μnormal. In general, it is admitted that the μnormal of dyes anchoring onto the TiO2 surface would induce a shift of the conduction band edge (ECB) of the semiconductor and thus affect the VOC according to eqn (1):44,45 (1)where q is the electron charge, μnormal is the dye vertical dipole moment perpendicular to the TiO2 surface, γ is the dye surface concentration, while ε0 and ε is the vacuum permittivity and dielectric constant of the organic monolayer, respectively. An appropriate promotion in dipole moment of the sensitizers could lift the ECB of TiO2 and raise the VOC in DSSCs. Meanwhile, the upward shift of the ECB of such a semiconductor could even enhance the driving force for continual electron transfer from the conduction band of TiO2 to the F-doped SnO2 (FTO) substrate, which might lead to an increase in JSC in turn.46,47

Finally, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of these four multi-branched dyes also rise in the sequence of JY69 < JY66 < JY68 < JY67 with a near linear positive correlation to their μnormal (R2 = 0.996) as shown in Fig. 6c, and asymmetrical carbazole-contained dye JY67 with the largest μnormal achieves the highest PCE. These results present similarity to Pang and coworkers’ recent observations,48 where high correlation could be constructed between the PCEs of the DSSCs and the dipole moments of the sensitizers in many classes, although the PCEs of the devices are actually thought to be influenced by intricate factors, e.g., light-harvesting region, electron injection driving force and charge collection efficiency. After co-adsorbtion with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), the JSC and PCE of all these dyes experience a decrease though still keep in the same order as that without a co-adsorbent (Table S2, ESI†), suggesting that the propeller-like TPE π-spacer could bring in a considerable anti-stacking ability regardless of the donors.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of DSSCs are presented in Fig. 6b. The IPCE spectral responses of all four TPE-based dyes cover analogous regions with onsets around 600 nm. Dyes JY66–68 exhibit a very similar IPCE response, but the values increase in the order of JY66 < JY68 < JY67, agreeing with the trend observed in JSC. It is noteworthy that the DTP-contained dye JY69 displays a very slight bathochromic-shifted response but the IPCE value only reaches to 50%, apparently lower than those of the other three counterparts and finally resulting in the lowest JSC.
3.5. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was determined under dark conditions scanning with bias voltages from −0.48 to −0.6 V at an interval of 30 mV as shown in Fig. 7a–c. Notably, the chemical capacitance (Cμ) could reflect the shift of ECB of the semiconductor. The fitted Cμ of these double-branched dyes meet an obvious promotion in the sequence of JY69 < JY66 < JY68 < JY67, in accordance with the dipole moment effect on the ECB edge as expected. On the other hand, the charge-transfer resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface (RCT) delivers the charge recombination rate between the electron injected into the semiconductor and the I−/I3− electrolyte. The symmetrical dye JY66 and asymmetrical carbazole-/phenothiazine-contained sensitizers JY67 and JY68 present almost the same RCT which, however, is remarkably larger than the DTP-contained dye JY69, suggesting that the original propeller-like TPA donor in dye JY66 or resultant large-sized neighboring donor in dye JY67/JY68 could work as more efficient charge barriers compared with a less bulky amount and thus insufficient hindrance at the DTP donor position in dye JY69. In addition, the electron life time could relate to the VOC values of DSSCs. The electron lifetime (τ) can be calculated by adopting the equation τ = RCT × Cμ, where the RCT is more dominant than Cμ. As a result, the lifetime also witness an elevation in the trend of JY69 < JY66 < JY68 < JY67 with unobvious disparity in dye JY66–68, matching with the corresponding VOC in DSSCs. Finally, the DTP-contained JY69 also exhibits a lower charge collection efficiency (ηcollect, calculated from EIS49) in comparison to the other three counterparts (Fig. S3, ESI†). That would intensify the loss on the current and thus induce an inferior JSC. These measurements reveal that substituting one of the TPA donors in symmetrical dye JY66 with carbazole or phenothiazine would not only promote the ECB of TiO2 but also consolidate the original anti-recombination capability of the twin-TPA donors, while inserting the DTP donor position would pose a threat to the intrinsic hindrance of the symmetrical reference JY66.

4. Conclusions
In summary, four X-shaped dyes featuring a three-dimensional TPE unit as π spacer have been designed and applied in DSSCs. TPA was selected as one donor while carbazole, phenothiazine or DTP was chosen as the neighboring donor to investigate the hetero donor effect on the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs. Replacing one of the TPA donors in symmetrical dye JY66 with another electron-rich condensed ring causes a certain change on the dipole moment of the dyes. In addition to the VOC and JSC increasing with the enlargement of the dipole moment in this series, it is notable to find that the PCEs present a near-linear correlation to the μnormal in the order of JY69 < JY66 < JY68 < JY67. In particular, the asymmetrical TPA and carbazole-coupled dye JY67 with the largest μnormal exhibit both the highest VOC and JSC to achieve the best PCE in this class. In contrast, inferior photovoltaic performance could be witnessed in DTP-contained dye JY69, resulting from both poor dipole moment and insufficient suppression on charge recombination. These results highlight that the carefully designed hetero-donor combination on such X-shaped π linkers would provide a promising way to improve the photovoltaic performance of multi-branched sensitizers in DSSCs.
