    , Accepted 27th July 2014First published on 28th July 2014AbstractNovel star-shaped hole transporting materials with a triazine unit have been synthesized. When the new Triazine-Th-OMeTPA was used as a hole transporting material in perovskite solar cells, the power conversion efficiency reached 12.51% under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination, showing competitive photovoltaic performance with the widely used spiro-OMeTAD based solar cell (13.45%).
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been considered a promising alternative to the silicon-based solar cells due to their low-cost production and simple device fabrication.1 DSSCs using liquid electrolytes of CoII/CoIII redox couples2 have shown efficiencies surpassing 12%. However, the stability issues of the DSSC devices arise from leakage and evaporation of liquid electrolytes. Much efforts have been made to replace liquid electrolytes with quasi-solid-state electrolytes3 or solid-state hole conductors4 to alleviate the stability issues. However, the photovoltaic power conversion efficiency of solid-state DSSCs (ssDSSCs) remains significantly below that of liquid electrolyte-based devices. Recently, the organometal halide perovskites (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl, Br, I)5 have attracted great attention due to their direct band gap, large optical absorption and high mobility. An impressive photovoltaic performance was achieved over 15% power conversion efficiency using 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) as a hole transporting material (HTM).6 The most effective HTM for the hybrid solar cells is spiro-OMeTAD, even though other small molecule HTMs such as 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-,7 pyrene-,8 linear π-conjugated structure,9 butadiene-,10 and swivel-cruciform thiophene-11 based HTMs gave high conversion efficiencies of 10–13%. However, the high synthetic cost of spiro-OMeTAD gives another problem for the commercialization. Therefore, the development of cost-effective HTMs with high efficiency and long stability is very important.
Herein, we report new types of hole transporting materials with donor–π–acceptor (D–A) systems by incorporating an electron-deficient 1,3,5-triazine core and an electron-rich diphenylamino unit. The molecular structure of the two HTMs is shown in Fig. 1a. Our strategy for choosing a 1,3,5-triazine unit is that the radical anion formed during irradiation is stabilized due to its electron deficiency.12 Another strategy for introducing the triarylamine derivatives is that the star-shaped organic materials have been widely used as HTMs in optoelectronic devices.13

The synthetic scheme for the preparation of 2,4,6-tris[N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino-N-phenylthiophen-2-yl]-1,3,5-triazine (Triazine-Th-OMeTPA) and 2,4,6-tris[N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino-N-diphenyl]-1,3,5-triazine (Triazine-Ph-OMeTPA) is shown in Fig. 1b.14 Detailed synthetic procedures are provided in the ESI.† The key step for their syntheses is the Stille coupling reaction15 of 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine with N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-[(5-(tributylstannyl)thiophen-2-yl)phenyl]amine and N,N-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-[(trimethylstannyl)biphenyl]amine. The target compounds Triazine-Th-OMeTPA and Triazine-Ph-OMeTPA were obtained in ∼50% yield.
The UV-vis spectra of Triazine-Th-OMeTPA and Triazine-Ph-OMeTPA measured in chlorobenzene are shown in the inset of Fig. 2a. The absorption spectrum of Triazine-Ph-OMeTPA exhibits an intense peak at 412 nm. λmax of Triazine-Th-OMeTPA (429 nm) was red-shifted by 17 nm relative to that of Triazine-Ph-OMeTPA. This bathochromic shift was attributed to the more planar configuration of Triazine-Th-OMeTPA, which possesses a 11.4° twist between the 1,3,5-triazine and the thienyl unit, as compared with the more twist one (25.7°) between the 1,3,5-triazine and the phenyl unit in Triazine-Ph-OMeTPA. The fluorescence spectrum of Triazine-Th-OMeTPA exhibits a maximum emission at 502 nm with a small Stoke's shift of 73 nm compared to a large Stoke's shift of 146 nm in Triazine-Ph-OMeTPA, demonstrating that a small structural change in the excited state occurs in Triazine-Th-OMeTPA due to a slight interaction between triazine and the thiophenyl unit.16Fig. 2a shows the absorption spectra of three HTMs processed on the perovskite-coated TiO2 films. Two new HTMs-coated films exhibit a broad and enhanced absorption band from 380 to 520 nm due to the superposed absorption characteristics of their constituents.

Fig. 2b shows the energy level diagram of the corresponding components in the device. The energy levels of HTMs were characterized by cyclic voltammetry. The HOMO levels of Triazine-Th-OMeTPA and Triazine-Ph-OMeTPA are measured to be −5.04 and −5.11 eV, respectively, which could match with CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV). Fig. 2c shows the device structure of the hybrid solar cells. The cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images shown in the Fig. 2d show the formation of a well-defined hybrid structure with clear interfaces. The thickness of TiO2, perovskite and the HTM layer is ∼320, 200 and 180 nm, respectively.

Fig. 3a shows photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of three devices. For reference, the device with spiro-OMeTAD as HTM is fabricated. As the solid-state sensitized cells have exhibited an impressive enhancement in photovoltaic conversion efficiency (PCE) by increasing the conductivity of HTMs via doping the additives such as 4-tert-butylpiridine (t-Bp), lithium bis(trifluoromethane-sulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)pyridine)cobalt(III) into the HTM,17 we attempted to fabricate the device by doping the three additives into a Triazine-Th-OMeTPA or a Triazine-Ph-OMeTPA hole conductor. The Triazine-Ph-OMeTPA based device gave Jsc = 19.14 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.93 V and FF = 0.61, affording PCE = 10.90%. Under the similar condition, the Triazine-Th-OMeTPA and spiro-OMeTAD based cells gave a Jsc of 20.74 and 21.37 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.92 and 0.94 V and a FF of 0.66 and 0.67, corresponding to a η of 12.51 and 13.45%, respectively. The photocurrent action spectra of the three devices are presented in Fig. 3b. The integrated photocurrent density of Triazine-Th-OMeTPA and Triazine-Ph-OMeTPA is 20.12 and 18.62 mA cm−2, respectively, which is in good agreement with the measured photocurrent density of 20.74 and 19.14 mA cm−2.

From the photovoltaic performances (Table 1), we have observed that the η value (12.51%) of Triazine-Th-OMeTPA based device is higher than that (10.90%) of Triazine-Ph-OMeTPA based one due to a high photocurrent and fill factor. Voc of the Triazine-Ph-OMeTPA based cell is slightly higher than that of Triazine-Th-OMeTPA based one, which is in good agreement with the relative difference in the HOMO levels of two HTMs. The high photo-current density of the Triazine-Th-OMeTPA based cell relative to Triazine-Ph-OMeTPA based one is responsible for the broad and red-shifted absorption of the mp-TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/Triazine-Th-OMeTPA device. In addition, the high fill factor of the Triazine-Th-OMeTPA based cell can be interpreted as its low series resistance (Rs) and high mobility. From the slope of the J–V curve around Voc, the Rs values of Triazine-Th-OMeTPA and Triazine-Ph-OMeTPA based cells are calculated to be 21.4 and 32.6 Ω cm−2, respectively, in which the lower value of Rs in the former cell results in the enhanced photocurrent density. To check the effect of hole mobility on the fill factor, we measured the hole mobility of HTMs from the space charge limitation of current (SCLC) J–V characteristics. The hole mobility values of Triazine-Th-OMeTPA, Triazine-Ph-OMeTPA and spiro-OMeTAD evaluated using the Mott–Gurney law18 are calculated to be 1.74 × 10−4, 1.50 × 10−4, and 4.43 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 S−1, respectively. The high hole mobility of Triazine-Th-OMeTPA relative to the Triazine-Ph-OMeTPA based cell led to an improved fill factor.

Fig. 4 show the photovoltaic performance during the long-term aging test of three devices. After 250 h of aging, the initial efficiency of 12.08% of the Triazine-Th-OMeTPA based cell decreased to 10.10%, giving a 16.4% reduction, which is comparable to that (12.4%) of spiro-OMeTAD based one. On the other hand, the initial efficiency of 10.42% of the Triazine-Ph-OMeTPA based cell sharply decreased to 6.08%, giving a 41.7% reduction. The stability of the Triazine-Th-OMeTPA based cell compared with the Triazine-Ph-OMeTPA based one may be attributable to a tight packing through an interfacial interaction between Pb of perovskite and S of the thiophenyl unit of HTM.16

In summary, we have designed and synthesized two novel star-shaped HTMs with a 1,3,5-triazine core. Although the photo-physical properties of the two HTMs are quite similar, the photovoltaic performance is quite sensitive to the structural modification of peripheral substituents. The perovskite based cell using Triazine-Th-OMeTPA as a HTM affords an overall conversion efficiency of 12.51%, showing a competitive photovoltaic performance to the spiro-OMeTAD based cell (13.45%). Moreover, the Triazine-Th-OMeTPA based cell showed a good stability for 250 h. We believe that the development of highly efficient hole transporting materials comparable to the state-of-the-art HTM spiro-OMeTAD is possible through meticulous molecular design, and studies directed to this goal are now in progress.
