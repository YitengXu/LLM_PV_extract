Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been considered as a promising alternative to traditional silicon-based solar cells because of their favourable ecological and economical features and easy handling and fabrication.1 As one of the important components in DSSCs, the redox electrolyte has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Recently, power conversion efficiencies of up to 11% have been achieved using a traditional iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple as the redox mediator.2 However, from the view point of practical applications, some limitations, such as the corrosion of metal-based current collectors (for example silver and copper), sublimation of iodine, and the absorption of visible light have been identified for the I−/I3− redox couple.3–5 Therefore, it is desirable to replace the I−/I3− redox couple based electrolyte and upgrade the efficiency of DSSCs.6–8 To date, several attempts have been made for DSSCs for dye regeneration, such as the use of metal complexes,4,5,9–15 Br−/Br3−,16 SCN−/(SCN)2,17 SeCN−/(SeCN)2,18 S2−/Sn,19–27 and 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-based redox shuttles.28,29
Recently, imidazolium iodide salt doped hybrid electrolytes, including hydroquinone/benzoquinone/I−, sulfide/polysulfide/I− and sulfur/I− for highly efficient DSSCs have been extensively studied.30–32 For example, Sun and Yang recently reported an efficiency of 8.4% with the use of hydroquinone/benzoquinone/1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium (DMPII) hybrid redox couples in acetonitrile electrolyte.32 The results of these hybrid electrolytes inspired us to study and develop DSSCs with even higher efficiencies.
In this work, for the first time, 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (PMII)/imidazolium functionalized TEMPO hybrid redox couples were prepared and applied in organic solvent electrolyte DSSCs. The resulting hybrid electrolyte DSSCs exhibited overall power conversion efficiencies of 8.2% and 9.1% under simulated air mass 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 100 mW cm−2 and 50 mW cm−2, respectively, which are higher than that of the traditional PMII/I2 based electrolyte. The results of this work will allow for future rational design of hybrid redox couples.

Fabrication of the DSSCs37–39
The cleaned FTO glass was covered with perforated adhesive tape to control the thickness and the area of the mesoporous TiO2 film; the area of the TiO2 film was about 0.283 cm2. The FTO glass was immersed in a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. Then two layers of TiO2 particles were deposited onto cleaned FTO glass and used as photoelectrodes. A 5 μm-thick film of 20 nm-sized TiO2 particles was deposited onto the FTO glass electrode by the doctor-blade technique. The film was dried at 125 °C for 5 min. Then, a second 3 μm-thick layer of 200 nm light-scattering anatase particles were coated on the top of the first TiO2 layer. The resulting TiO2 films were annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. The two layers of TiO2 film were once again treated with 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution, then rinsed with water and ethanol and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the obtained TiO2 electrode was immersed in 0.5 mM D205 solution in acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol at room temperature for 24 h. Then the dye-coated TiO2 electrode was washed with anhydrous ethanol and dried with a nitrogen stream. To prepare the Pt counter electrode, two drops of 2 mM H2PtCl6 in ethanol were placed onto the cleaned FTO glass substrate, followed by drying and annealing at 400 °C for 15 min.
DSSCs were fabricated by sandwiching gel electrolytes between a dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and a Pt counter electrode, which were separated by a 25 μm thick hot melt ring (Surlyn, Dupont) and sealed by heating. The cell internal space was filled with electrolyte via vacuum backfilling. The electrolyte injection hole on the thermally platinized FTO counter electrode was finally sealed with a Surlyn sheet and thin glass by heating.
Characterization and photovoltaic measurements

1HNMR spectra were carried out on a Varian 400 MHz spectrometer, one drop of neat phenylhydrazine was added to the samples containing a nitroxyl radical prior to the analysis by 1H NMR in order to reduce in situ the paramagnetic center to the corresponding hydroxylamine species.36
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on a CHI660c electrochemical workstation in combination with a conventional three-electrode system. A Pt disc, Pt wire, and Ag/Ag+ were used as the working, counter and reference electrode, respectively. All the CV electrolyte solutions contained 0.1 M lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) as the supporting electrolyte and acetonitrile as the solvent. The electrochemical system was calibrated with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+). UV-vis spectra were acquired using a TU-1800 SPC spectrometer.
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the devices were recorded using a CHI660c electrochemical workstation using the AC impedance method, the forward bias voltage for the impedance measurements was −0.8 V and the frequency ranged from 0.01 to 105 Hz under dark conditions, and the amplitude was 5 mV.40 The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the assembled DSSCs shielded by an aluminum foil mask with an aperture area of 0.1 cm2 were measured with a digital source meter (Keithley, model 2612) under simulated air mass (AM) 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 15, 50, and 100 mW cm−2, respectively. The incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) plotted as a function of the excitation wavelength was recorded on a Keithley 1612 source meter under the irradiation of a Xenon lamp with a monochromator (Oriel Cornerstone™ 260 1/4).
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 shows a general synthetic procedure and the chemical structure of the imidazolium functionalized TEMPO, [MeIm-TEMPO][TFSI]. It has been shown that the redox potential of the redox couples plays a very important role in determining the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.31 Here, the redox potential of the [MeIm-TEMPO][TFSI] was determined by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 using 0.1 M LiClO4 as the supporting electrolyte as shown in Fig. 1a. The redox potentials were converted to those versus a normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) reference scale by adding a constant of 0.63 V.3 The standard redox potential of 4-OH-TEMPO/4-OH-TEMPO+ was determined to be 0.28 V versus Fc/Fc+ (i.e., about 0.91 V vs. NHE), while that of [MeIm-TEMPO][TFSI]/([MeIm-TEMPO][TFSI])+ was determined to be 0.39 V versus Fc/Fc+ (i.e., about 1.02 V vs. NHE), which was 0.11 V higher than that of the 4-OH-TEMPO/4-OH-TEMPO+ redox couple, as shown in Fig. 1a. We can see from Fig. 1b that the more negative reduction peak of the PMII/I2 solution (marked with ‘*’) takes place at the counter electrode of the DSSC and is vital for the operation of the DSSC (i.e., about 0.42 V vs. NHE).41 The redox potentials of 4-OH-TEMPO/4-OH-TEMPO+ and [MeIm-TEMPO][TFSI]/([MeIm-TEMPO][TFSI])+ are higher than that of PMII/I2 which make the hybrid redox potential of PMII/4-OH-TEMPO (i.e., about 0.44 V vs. NHE) and PMII/[MeIm-TEMPO][TFSI] (i.e., about 0.47 V vs. NHE) positively shifted. The energy loss incurred during the dye regeneration is one of the main factors limiting the performance of the DSSCs.4,28 Therefore, both the PMII/4-OH-TEMPO and PMII/[MeIm-TEMPO][TFSI] hybrid electrolytes have a higher redox potential, which will result in a higher open-circuit voltage of the devices as compared with the I−/I3− redox couple.

The compositions of the electrolytes are listed in Table 1. Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis spectra of the electrolytes applied in this work. It can be clearly seen that the I−/I3− based electrolyte A shows a strong absorption up to more than 470 nm, while the PMII/4-OH-TEMPO and PMII/[MeIm-TEMPO][TFSI] hybrid electrolytes show negligible absorption in the visible region, indicating that the competition with the high absorption of the sensitizer in the visible region could be avoided. Fig. 3 shows a photograph of the electrolytes containing different redox couples. It can be seen that the colours of the hybrid electrolytes are much lighter than that of the PMII/I2 based electrolyte.

It can be seen that the average efficiencies of the I−/I3− electrolyte and PMII/4-OH-TEMPO are 6.8% and 7.2% under simulated AM 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 100 mM cm−2, respectively. Electrolyte C (PMII/[MeIm-TEMPO][TFSI] hybrid liquid electrolyte) showed the highest average efficiency of 8.2% with Jsc of 18.4 mA cm−2, Voc of 729 mV and FF of 60.8%. Electrolytes B and C gave higher Jsc than electrolyte A, probably due to the higher conversion efficiency in the region between 350 and 650 nm, as shown in Fig. 6.
The Mott–Schottky behaviour of the TiO2 layer with different electrolytes was obtained to determine their flat-band potentials (Vfb), as shown in Fig. 5. The Voc of the cells is determined from the redox potential in the electrolyte and the quasi Fermi level, which increases linearly with Vfb.42 A negative shift of Vfb in Fig. 5 means a shift away from the redox potential, therefore an increase of Voc. The conduction band of TiO2 with the PMII/[MeIm-TEMPO][TFSI] hybrid electrolyte is about 72 mV more positive than that of the PMII/4-OH-TEMPO based electrolyte and about 196 mV more positive than that of PMII/I2 based electrolyte, which means that the PMII/[MeIm-TEMPO][TFSI] hybrid electrolyte obtains the highest Voc.
 Fig. 5  The Mott–Schottky behaviour of TiO2 with different electrolytes. 
The DSSC containing hybrid electrolyte shows higher Voc and Jsc than the pure iodine-based electrolyte. It may be that the presence of [MeIm-TEMPO][TFSI] in the electrolyte suppresses the formation of I3−.31 The dye (D) is excited under illumination by light and injects electrons to TiO2. After electron injection from the excited dye (D*), the oxidized dye (D+) is reduced by iodide forming diiodide radicals (I2−˙). Then the oxidized I2−˙ reacts with [MeIm-TEMPO][TFSI] to form I− and [MeIm-TEMPO][TFSI]+, and the formation of I3− is suppressed. Finally, [MeIm-TEMPO][TFSI]+ gets an electron at the counter electrode and in turn regenerates the reduced form. The possible redox reaction is given by the following reactions: D/TiO2 + hν → D*(1) D* → D+ + e− (TiO2)(2) D+ + 2I− → D + I2−˙(3) I2−˙ + [MeIm-TEMPO][TFSI] → 2I− + [MeIm-TEMPO][TFSI]+(4) [MeIm-TEMPO][TFSI]+ + e− → [MeIm-TEMPO][TFSI](5)
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values of the cells based on the electrolytes A, B and C are shown in Fig. 6. The broad feature appears to cover the visible spectrum range from 400 to 650 nm. The maximum IPCE values at around 530 nm are 81.9%, 84.7% and 87.0% for the cells with electrolyte A, B and C, respectively. The higher photocurrent response of cells B and C than the iodine based cell A is caused by light absorption over a large range of wavelengths by the iodine electrolyte, as shown in Fig. 2.43 It is obvious that the IPCE is consistent with the variation of Jsc. The PCEs of the three devices under illumination by different light intensities are summarized in Table 3. It can be seen that the PCE values of the cells at 0.5 sunlight are higher than those at 1.0 sunlight, probably due to the inefficient charge screening of electron transport within the nanocrystalline TiO2 film.44 The PCE values at 0.15 sunlight are lower than those at sunlight because of the photocurrent response to the light intensity and the changes in the performance parameters, such as a lowered Voc and FF.45 Cell C displays a maximum PCE value of 9.1% among the three devices under the simulated air mass 1.5 solar illumination with an intensity of 50 mW cm−2.

The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) technique was further used to reveal the appreciable difference in the charge transfer resistance in DSSCs, especially for understanding the recombination dynamics at the dye coated TiO2/electrolyte.30,46 Cells A and C were measured at −0.8 V bias in a dark environment, as shown in Fig. 7. From high to low frequency, three semicircles are observed in the Nyquist plots. R1 (first semicircle in the Nyquist plot), R2 (second semicircle in the Nyquist plot) and R3 (third semicircle in the Nyquist plot) represent the charge-transfer resistance at the counter electrode, the resistance of the TiO2/FTO, TiO2/electrolyte interface, and the Nernst diffusion in the electrolyte, respectively. Bode phase plots of the EIS spectra display the characteristic frequency peaks of the charge transfer process for all the cells. The effective lifetime of the electrons (τe) before recombination in the TiO2 photoelectrode can be related to the inverse of the characteristic frequency and estimated by the following equation:32  where fmax is the maximum frequency of the intermediate-frequency peak.
 Fig. 7  The EIS Nyquist plots (a) and Bode phase plots (b) recorded in the dark for cells A and C. 
It can be seen that R1 value of cell A is lower than that of cell C, indicating that the I−/I3− based electrolyte A is easily reduced by the Pt counter electrode, which leads to a higher FF.31 Future studies will seek a suitable catalyst for the counter electrolyte to improve the fill factor of devices using this imidazolium functionalized TEMPO redox couple. The bigger the diameter of the middle frequency semicircle, the smaller the amount of charge recombination at the dye-coated TiO2 photoanode/electrolyte interface.32 The charge-transfer resistance (R2) values of cells A and C were calculated to be 80.3 and 100.0 Ω, respectively. The effective electron lifetimes (τe) are 7.5 ms and 11.1 ms for cells A and C. These results demonstrate that cell C has a lower rate of recombination reaction between the conduction band electron in the TiO2 photoanode and the electrolyte interface than Cell A, which leads to an enhanced Jsc and a higher photoconversion efficiency.3,31
The stability of the PMII/imidazolium functionalized TEMPO hybrid electrolyte and the I−/I3− based electrolytes was investigated under dark conditions at room temperature. The total efficiencies were normalized to the values measured on the first day, as shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen that the devices containing the hybrid electrolyte C retained around 75% of their initial conversion efficiency after a test of about 800 h, which is similar to the I−/I3− based electrolyte (∼74% of the initial efficiency). According to studies previously reported, most iodine-free redox couples are not so stable even though they show higher efficiency than PMII/I2 based electrolytes. The reasons for the device degradation are still not clear. Here, the imidazolium functionalized TEMPO based hybrid electrolyte shows a long-term stability as good as that of iodide/triiodide redox couples.

Conclusions
In conclusion, an imidazolium functionalized TEMPO/PMII hybrid redox couple was synthesized and used in combination with an organic dye (D205) in DSSCs. The resulting hybrid redox couple electrolyte showed negligible absorption in the visible region and a higher redox potential compared with the I−/I3− redox couple. The fabricated DSSCs showed overall efficiencies of 8.2% and 9.1% under simulated air mass 1.5 solar spectrum illumination at 100 mW cm−2 and 50 mW cm−2, respectively, which are higher than that of a traditional PMII/I2 based electrolyte.
