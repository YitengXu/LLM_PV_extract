    AbstractRecent development of a fused aromatic thieno[3.4-b]pyrazine system and their application in optoelectronic devices are reviewed. Introduction of a fused aromatic unit followed by side chain engineering, dramatically enhanced the charge carrier mobility in thin film transistor devices and mobilities up to 0.2 cm2/Vs were achieved. The optoelectronic properties of these fused aromatic thienopyrazine polymers (Eg = 1.3 to 1.6 eV, HOMO = −4.9 to −5.2 V) were tuned by introduction of various fused aromatic rings within thienopyrazine. By balancing the fundamental properties of these polymers, both high charge carrier mobilities and moderate PCEs in solar cells were achieved. Further, effects of copolymerizing units are discussed. Low band gap semiconducting polymer (Eg ∼ 1 eV) with high field effect mobility (0.044 cm2/Vs) was obtained using cyclopentadithiophene as copolymerizing unit. Finally, a molecular design approach to enhance the absorption coefficients is discussed, which resulted in improved power conversion efficiency in bulk heterojunction solar cells.Rajib MondalDr Rajib Mondal is a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Chemical Engineering at Stanford University.

1. Introduction
Significant efforts in recent years have been devoted to developing new conjugated polymers for molecular electronics applications, especially for organic thin film transistors and bulk heterojunction solar cells. The main advantage of polymeric materials is their amenability to large-scale and low-cost fabrication from solution processing techniques.1 Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly(phenylene vinylene) (PPV) have been used extensively to achieve fundamental understanding of the physical processes within molecular devices, particularly for solar cells.2 With the development of bulk-heterojunction solar cells, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) approaching 5% using P3HT could be achieved and this state-of-the-art technology became close towards commercialization.3 The PCEs of P3HT and PPV solar cells were limited by low total absorption of sunlight, mainly due to their large band gaps (>1.9 eV).3,4 Development of lower band gap polymers became necessary to achieve increased solar cell efficiencies and thus, compete with inorganic semiconductor-based (silicon, CIGS, cadmium telluride) solar cells. With the recent development of new donor–acceptor polymers, PCEs as high as ∼7.4% have been reported.5
The optimization of polymer solar cells requires the balancing of a series of material parameters, including band gap, frontier molecular orbital energies, absorption coefficients, and charge carrier mobility.6 In donor–acceptor polymers, a combination of an electron donor and an acceptor unit are typically copolymerized.7 As shown in Fig. 1, hybridization of frontier molecular orbitals (HOMO and LUMO) of donor and acceptor units yields a low bandgap D–A monomer unit. The chemical nature of these donor and acceptor units can be tuned independently and individually to achieve optimized photophysical and electrochemical properties. A number of common donor and acceptor units have been developed in the last decade. Some examples are benzothiadiazole (BTZ),8 thienopyrazine (TP),9 quinoxaline,10 diketopyrrolopyrrole,11 thienothiophene5 and their derivatives as acceptor units and fluorene, silafluorene, carbazole, cyclopentadithiophene, thiophene, benzodithiophene and their derivatives as donor units.

Copolymers of BTZ with other donor units have been successful in photovoltaic devices achieving PCEs of over 6% in solar cells.12 The TP structure is an isomer of BTZ and is, thus, also attractive as an acceptor unit owing to the ease of synthetic modification of the structure. In addition, TP structure is more advantageous compared to BTZ (Fig. 2) in terms of resonance structures. In contrast to BTZ, the quinoid form of TP forms a six membered aromatic sextet, and thus additionally lowers the band gap of conjugated polymers by driving the resonance throughout the polymer backbone. Another potential advantage of TP in conjugated polymers is that the TP moiety provides a more planar backbone between repeating units owing to decreased steric hindrance of the thiophene ring compared to the benzene ring in BTZ polymers.

Various polymers containing TP units have been investigated for solar cells.13–20 Overall, TP copolymers showed maximum PCEs of about 2% in solar cells. Recently, Zhou et al. has systematically compared BTZ and TP acceptor units with various donor units and concluded that the higher HOMO energy levels of TP polymers cause the lower efficiencies in solar cells.21 In addition, we identified that the low charge carrier mobilities of TP polymers is a big hurdle to achieve higher photocurrent and may be additionally responsible for lower efficiency. Charge carrier mobilities of TP polymers are typically reported in the range of 10−3-10−4 cm2/Vs in thin film transistor devices.14,22,23 It is important to note that the diode mobility is more pertinent for photovoltaic applications. However, mobilities in field effect transistor devices tend to correlate well with diode mobilities.24 The synthetic methodology to tune the band gap and energy levels of TP polymers is well established, but there is not a single approach that can effectively control the charge carrier mobilities of the devices fabricated from TP polymers. Novel fused aromatic TP-based acceptors have recently been developed and employed in donor–acceptor type conjugated polymers.9,25–30 The fused unit provides a planar, electron rich π-face, which promotes well ordered inter-chain packing and improves charge carrier mobility. This highlight will focus on current progress of fused TPs for electronic applications. First, we will review the polymers with the fused TP unit in a commonly used fluorene-based copolymer structure,8,14,16,31–33 as shown in Fig. 3b. Alkyl substituted thiophenes between donor and acceptor units helped to achieve a lower band gap and increased solubility of the polymers. The role of alkyl chains, molecular weight, and inclusion of fused aromatic units in fluorene copolymers, followed by effect of copolymerizing donor unit on these aromatic TP-based polymeric systems will be reviewed. Furthermore, an approach to control the absorption co-efficient and molecular packing of such polymers will be also discussed.

2. Effect of alkyl chains
Long alkyl chains are used in conjugated polymers to obtain the desired solubility in organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, etc. In order to investigate the effect of alkyl chains in fused aromatic thienopyrazine systems, linear (octyl and dodecyl) or branched (2-ethylhexyl) alkyl chains were introduced into the acenaphthyl based fused system as shown in Fig. 4 (DAC-OF, DAC-DF, DAC-EHF, EHAC-EHF) and investigated in thin-film transistor and solar cell devices.9,28 The alkyl chains had negligible effect on the electronic properties of the polymers, as shown in the absorption of spectra of polymers with various alkyl chains (Fig. 5). For example, HOMO energy levels of DAC-OF, DAC-DF, DAC-EHF, EHAC-EHF were ∼ −5.0 V with an almost constant bandgap in the range of 1.55–1.6 eV (Table 1) and little effect on absorption coefficients.9,28

While these polymers exhibited similar electronic properties, a large variation in the performances in thin film transistors and bulk heterojunction solar cells was observed, Fig. 6. The origin of this large variation was mainly attributed to the differences in crystallinity and thin film morphology, an area where alkyl chains play a significant role. Films of DAC-OF could not be obtained due to a lower solubility and, thus, could not be used for device characterization. However, the three other polymers (DAC-DF, DAC-EHF, EHAC-EHF) showed p-channel transport (h+) with high mobilities. The highest hole carrier mobility of 0.2 cm2/Vs was obtained with DAC-DF, containing all linear alkyl chains.9 The hole carrier mobility reduced to 0.07 cm2/Vs in the case of EHAC-EHF, which had all branched alkyl chains.28 The lowest mobility (0.016 cm2/VS) was observed in the DAC-EHF polymer, containing both linear and branched alkyl chains. Introduction of branched alkyl chains decreased the crystallinity in the thin film as determined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) analysis (Fig. 7 and 8). Thus, hole carrier mobility was reduced by 12 times in the partially branched alkyl chains substituted polymer DAC-EHF. Interestingly, introduction of all branched alkyl chains in EHAC-EHF appeared to regain crystallinity in the polymer thin film according to AFM and GIXD. The AFM image (Fig. 7c) showed a very rough film with large, well-defined and randomly oriented polymer domains. GIXD of this sample showed strong arching consistent with nanocrystalline morphology (Fig. 8a and d). However, no transition temperature was observed for EHAC-EHF in the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) scans, which indicated lower crystallinity compared to DAC-DF and explains the lower hole carrier mobility.

In bulk heterojunction solar cell devices, the acenaphthyl based polymers showed moderate power conversion efficiencies (PCE up to 1.4%) when used as donor materials with fullerene derivatives as acceptors.9,28 Interestingly, the polymer with all branched alkyl chains, EHAC-EHF, showed better PCE (1.3%) compared to the polymer with all linear alkyl chains, DAC-DF (0.39%), in contrast with the lower field effect mobility (h+) of the former. The mixed alkyl chain polymer, DAC-EHF, also showed relatively higher PCE (1.38%) in solar cells compared to DAC-DF. Typically, linear alkyl chains promote crystallinity within polymer films, thus, improve the charge carrier mobility in thin-film transistor applications. Although high charge carrier mobility is desirable for solar cells, the high crystallinity of the polymers can promote phase separation from acceptor materials (e.g.[6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)) used in the active layer blend and subsequently reduces the efficiency of the solar cell.28
3. Effect of molecular weight
Effect of molecular weight was investigated using the all-linear alkyl chain polymer, DAC-DF (1–4), as it affects the performances of the molecular devices.34 Molecular weights (Mws) were controlled by varying the time for polymerization.9 The Mws and their performances are summarized in Table 2. A decrease in mobility was observed with increasing Mw for copolymers 1–4. Usually higher mobility is obtained from higher Mw polymers. This opposite effect was attributed to differences in film structure, and does not necessarily reflect intrinsic material properties. According to the AFM (Fig. 9a–c), the grains of annealed films shrunk and became less defined as the Mw increased.9 Corresponding X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra are shown Fig. 9d, which indicated 1, 3 and 4 have equal d-spacing, but the intensity of this signal decreased with increasing Mw, indicating a lower degree of crystallinity in the higher Mw films. The 22.66 Å out of plane spacing in these films suggested partial interdigitation of side chains,31,32 favoring the formation of lamellar and π-stacked sheets and enhancing charge transport.33 The inset shows slices of grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) spectra from 1 and 4. These show reduction in film ordering with increasing Mw, as evidenced by the greater intensity of diffraction spots and the presence of in-plane diffraction rods for film 1 (white arrows), compared to the weak out-of-plane spot and diffraction arch on film 4.

4. Effect of fused aromatic unit
Electronic properties of fused thienopyrazine polymers depended significantly on the fused-aromatic moiety present in the thienopyrazine unit (Fig. 10a).28,30 For example, the band gap of EHAC-EHF containing acenaphthyl fused aromatic unit was 1.62 eV, whereas that of EHPH-EHF containing phenanthrene fused aromatic unit was 1.40 eV. Thus, the maximum absorption EHPH-EHF was red shifted by ∼100 nm.28 The band gap was reduced by an additional ∼0.1 eV by introducing different isomers of benzodithiophene (BDT, thiophene analogs of phenanthrene) in the thienopyrazine unit of the fluorene copolymers (BDTdn-FL and BDTup-FL).30 In addition, the frontier molecular orbital energy levels were systematically tuned by varying these fused aromatic units as shown in Fig. 10b. The differences in the electronic energy levels were attributed to shifts in the LUMO levels originating from the nature of the aromatic group fused onto the electron-accepting moieties. The LUMO wave-function localized onto the fused aromatic groups and thus is more affected by the electron-accepting nature of the acceptor, while the HOMO wave-function was more delocalized along the polymer backbone and only marginally affected by the acceptor characteristics.28 The thiophene-enriched BDT groups enhance the electron-accepting nature of the thienopyrazine group.30 However, no dramatic changes in the absorption coefficients was observed due to different fused aromatic units.28,30

(b) Relative HOMO and LUMO energy levels, band gaps (Eg) of EHAC-EHF, EHPH-EHF, BDTup-FL, and BDTdn-FL (acenaphthyl, phenanthrene, and benzodithiophene based FL copolymers); (plotted based on the data reported in Ref. 28 and 30). 
Along with the different electronic properties, device characteristics also varied from polymer to polymer. Compared to acenaphthyl class polymers (for example EHAC-EHF), the phenanthrene based copolymer EHPH-EHF showed significantly reduced carrier mobility (μmax ∼ 10−4 cm2/Vs) and increased (1.4 V to 8.8 V) in the threshold voltage (Vth) for p-channel transport.28 The shift in Vth towards more positive voltage was an indication that the device was turned on more easily. This was attributed to the lower oxidation potential of the electron rich phenanthrene unit within the polymer.28 Furthermore, replacing the aromatic unit by benzo[1,2-b:4,3-b′]dithiophene in BDTdn-FL further reduced the carrier mobility (∼10−5 cm2/Vs) and shifted the Vth to 17 V.30 However, Vth (−23 V) shifted to a high negative voltage in the case of the benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-based polymer, BDTup-FL, and much higher carrier mobility (∼10−2 cm2/Vs) was obtained. Lower mobility of BDTdn-FL was explained by the larger π–π stacking distance compared to BDTup-FL. The increased π–π distance lead to decreased overlap between π orbitals on adjacent molecules and thus results in reduced charge carrier mobility.30
The performance of these polymers was tested in bulk heterojunction solar cell architecture.28,30 PCEs in solar cell devices and charge carrier mobilities in transistor devices are compared in Fig. 11. The open circuit voltage (Voc) of EHPH-EHF was ∼0.1 V lower, as compared to the similar EHAC-EHF due to higher HOMO energy levels. Maximum PCE using a blend of EHAC-EHF and PCBM was 1.3%. However, the PCE reached only 0.57% in the case of EHPH-EHF due to low short circuit current. BDTup-FL showed the best PCE (1.4%) among these fluorene copolymers, owing to a balance of hole carrier mobility and absorption in the NIR region of solar spectrum. A slight increase in the Voc was also observed in BDTup-FL cells (∼0.6 V) compared to EHPH-EHF (∼0.48 V) due to its higher ionization potential.30

5. Effect of copolymerizing unit
In addition to utilizing fluorene (FL) as the copolymerizing unit, dithiophene (DT) and cyclopentadithiophene (CPDT) were employed as donor monomers in fused aromatic thienopyrazine based donor–acceptor polymers.28,30DT was reported for acenaphthyl and phenanthrene based polymers (DAC-DT, EHAC-DT, and EHPH-DT),28 while CPDT moiety was reported for benzodithiophene based polymers (BDTup-CPDT and BDTdn-CPDT).30 In both cases (DT and CPDT), the longer wavelength peaks were dramatically red-shifted (0.2–0.25 eV) as compared to FL analogs. An analysis of both the experimental and calculated values indicated that differences in the absorption peaks of the DT and FL copolymers are due to differences in the electronic properties of the donor units; namely, overlap between the HOMO and LUMO wave functions, and extent of (de)localization along the copolymer backbone.28,30 The comparison of solution and thin-film absorption spectra reveals that in thin films, the absorption peaks of the DT copolymers were red shifted by 60–90 nm, whereas the FL copolymers were red-shifted by only 10–40 nm, indicating the DT unit promoted better inter-chain packing. CPDT unit behaved similarly to the DT unit in terms of optoelectronic properties of the polymers, except for the nature of absorption. While the absorption coefficients of FL and DT copolymers remained very low, this was significantly enhanced in the CPDT based copolymers. For example, absorption coefficient was increased by almost a factor of two from the FL copolymer BDTup-FL (3.5 × 104 cm−1) to the CPDT copolymer BDTup-CPDT (6.2 × 104 cm−1), Fig. 12. Absorption of CPDT copolymers (BDTdn-CPDT and BDTup-CPDT) was broader compared to FL copolymers and extended up to 1210 and 1125 nm with band gaps approaching 1 eV.30
 Fig. 12  (top) Structure of the thienopyrazine based copolymers with dithiophene and cyclopentadithiophene. (bottom) Comparison of the absorption spectra of thin films of copolymers with different copolymerizing unit (adapted from Ref. 28 and 30). 
In order to understand the influence of the copolymerizing unit on molecular packing, benzodithiophene based FL and CPDT copolymers were investigated using GIXD.30 While the π–π stacking distances remained almost constant (∼4 Å), the inter-layer d-spacing of CPDT polymers (∼13 Å) decreased by 35–40% as compared to the FL copolymers (∼20 Å). It was found that the alkyl chains on the thiophene rings can “open up” to accommodate the alkyl chains of a neighboring CPDT unit within the formed cavity. For the FL polymers, on the other hand, given that all the alkyl side chains of the thiophene and FL units are located on the same side, the steric hindrance among these chains prevented the same type of interdigitation as in the CPDT polymers (Fig. 13). This accounted for the higher interlayer d-spacings. This, side chain interdigitation helped registration between the adjacent lamellae of CPDT polymers, and, thus, led to high charge carrier mobilities compared to FL polymers. Hole carrier mobilities of up to 0.044 cm2/Vs have been reported for BDTup-CPDT.30

All DT co-polymers showed very poor charge carrier mobilities (∼10−3 cm2/Vs), which was attributed to the more flexible nature of the DT-containing backbone.29 This is also the reason why the choice of linear or branched alkyl substituents on the acceptor did not have a large effect on the field-effect mobility.29
Both DT and CPDT copolymers showed lower open circuit voltage (Voc) compared to their FL analogs.28,30 HOMOs of these polymers in thin films are higher in energy (−4.6 to −4.8 V), which resulted in decreased open circuit voltages in solar cell devices (0.3–0.4 V). Thus, overall PCE of these polymers in solar cells remains limited.28,30
6. Control of absorption strength and molecular packing
In the previous sections, a commonly used fluorene-based copolymer structure, such as EHAC-EHF, where a substituted thiophene was used between donor and acceptor units, was reviewed. This approach helped to achieve a lower band gap and better polymer solubility. In order to avoid confusion, the EHAC-EHF polymer structure will be abbreviated ACT-T-FL to reflect the composition of the main polymer chain (acenaphthylthienopyrazine-thiophene-fluorene). Thus, the comparable polymer lacking the adjacent thiophene unit is abbreviated as ACT-FL. Though significantly improved charge carrier mobilities (up to 0.2 cm2/V.s) were achieved by introducing fused aromatic thienopyrazine unit in ACT-T-FL copolymers, the PCEs of ACT-T-FL:PCBM blends in solar cell devices were still limited to 1.4%, mainly due to rather low short-circuit current density (Jsc, 5 mA/cm2) and Voc (0.6 V) values.9,28 These Jsc and Voc values were attributed to limited absorption coefficients (α<6 × 104 cm−1) and rather small ionization potentials (∼5 eV).28 Although, there is a significant understanding on methodology to control the band gap and energy levels of frontier molecular orbitals, there is limited understanding about enhancing polymer absorption coefficients.29 A theoretical investigation using Density Functional Theory (DFT) indicated that the removal of the adjacent thiophene groups around the acceptor core in low band gap polymers markedly increases HOMO/LUMO overlap by delocalizing both the HOMO and LUMO wave functions (Fig. 14).29 This enhanced the absorption coefficient for the lowest optical transition (which is dominated by HOMO-to-LUMO electron excitation)35 within polymer structures such as ACT-FL. The absorption coefficient of ACT-FL was shown to increase by 1.5 times at the peak position in the low band gap region compared to its adjacent thiophene analogue (ACT-T-FL). In addition, ACT-FL demonstrated higher ionization potential or deeper HOMO energy level (5.26 eV) compared to ACT-T-FL (5 eV). The higher ionization potentials of ACT-FL would potentially produce higher Voc in solar cell devices. This was an additional advantage of the ACT-FL structure compared to ACT-T-FL. By controlling these fundamental properties of the polymers, a significant enhancement of the Voc and nearly a two-fold increase in the Jsc were observed in ACT-FL cells (Voc = 0.725 V, Jsc = 5.14 mA/cm2) compared to ACT-T-FL cells (Voc = 0.595 V, Jsc = 2.5 mA/cm2). A PCE of 1.6% was achieved using ACT-FL compared to 0.7% in ACT-T-FL (Fig. 15).29

Furthermore, both ACT-FL and ACT-T-FL formed crystalline thin films.29 In top contact thin film transistors devices, ACT-FL showed a much lower charge carrier mobility (2.3 × 10−3 cm2/Vs) as compared to ACT-T-FL (7 × 10−2 cm2/Vs). In contrary, hole mobility of ACT-FL (1.06 × 10−5 cm2/V.s) in diode device was one order of magnitude higher compared to that of ACT-T-FL (2.9 × 10−6 cm2/V.s).29 The polymer with higher transistor mobility is expected to show higher diode mobility.24 However, the opposite trend was observed in these two polymers. To rationalize this observation, it is important to recognize that transistor mobility is measured in the plane of the substrate, while the diode mobility is measured perpendicular to the substrate. According to the GIXD analysis, the planar π-face of the acenaphthyl group of ACT-FL was preferentially oriented parallel to the substrate (Fig. 16), which acted to reduce the μFET, but to enhance the diode mobility.29 This packing is believed to be ideal for efficient solar cell performance. On the other hand, polymer structures like ACT-T-FL, tend to form either randomly oriented nanocrystalline domains or the arrangements in which the π-face is perpendicular to the substrate.29 Thus, this packing is non-ideal for solar cell device performance.

7. Summary and conclusions
The optimization of polymer-based bulk heterojunction solar cells requires the careful balancing of a series of materials parameters. In this regard, novel fused aromatic thienopyrazine-based acceptors have been developed and employed in donor–acceptor type conjugated polymers. Introduction of a fused aromatic unit dramatically enhanced the charge carrier mobility in thin film transistor devices and mobilities up to 0.2 cm2/Vs have been reported. Side chains in these conjugated polymers played a crucial role in controlling the thin film morphology. Linear alkyl chains promoted enhanced crystallinity which was a desired property for thin-film transistor devices, but not necessarily for solar cells. Although high charge carrier mobility was desirable for solar cells, high crystallinity of the polymers promoted phase separation from the acceptor materials (i.e. PCBM) and subsequently reduced the solar cell efficiency.
In addition, introduction of various fused aromatic units within thienopyrazine was a convenient approach to tune the optoelectronic properties of donor–acceptor polymers (Eg = 1.3 to 1.6 eV, HOMO = −4.9 to −5.2 V). By balancing the fundamental properties of these polymers, both high charge carrier mobilities and moderate PCEs in solar cells have been achieved. The band gap of these fused thienopyrazine polymers was further lowered by co-polymerizing with cyclopentadithiophene or bithiophene (Eg ∼ 1 eV). Although the copolymerizing unit in these polymers did not affect the nature of the face-to-face π–π stacking (mainly controlled by the fused thienopyrazine unit), it played a significant role in inter layer d-spacings. For example, side chains of cyclopentadithiophene polymers tend to interdigitate between lamellae showed higher charge carrier mobility (μFET = 0.044 cm2/Vs) compared to the analogous fluorene polymers (μFET = 8.1 × 10−3 cm2/Vs).
Finally, it was shown that the removal of the adjacent thiophene groups around the acceptor core in low band gap polymers markedly increased the optical absorption and raised the polymer ionization potential. Consequently, significant enhancement in PCE was observed in solar cell devices using fused thienopyrazine-based polymers without adjacent thiophenes, due to increased Voc and Jsc. We believe that this approach will be helpful for future design of polymers for solar cell applications.
