    , Accepted 11th November 2020First published on 11th November 2020AbstractConjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) have developed as promising hole transport materials for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The conjugated backbone serves as an efficient vehicle for transporting holes, and the electric dipole layer formed through the organization of ionic groups on CPEs may improve the hole collection efficiency. In this work, three CPEs anchored with –N(CH3)3+, –SO3− and –NH3+ ions, denoted as BF-NMe3, BF-SO3 and BF-NH3, respectively, were synthesized and applied as the hole transport material (HTM) of inverted planar PSCs. Replacing the benchmark material, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), with the three CPEs as the HTM considerably improves the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. The results from scanning electron microscope imaging, X-ray diffraction and time-resolved photoluminescence indicate that the structure of the ionic species rather than the type of charge has a decisive impact on the perovskite morphology. Both cationic BF-NH3 and anionic BF-SO3 layers enable methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) to grow into larger crystals and grains with fewer defects. Moreover, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that the BF-NH3 and BF-SO3 devices have comparable charge recombination resistance, which is apparently higher than that of the BF-NMe3 and PEDOT:PSS devices. Consequently, the cationic BF-NH3 can act as an excellent HTM as the anionic BF-SO3 and the champion cell based on BF-NH3 exhibits a superior power conversion efficiency of 17.7%.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable research interest in the past decade because organometal halide perovskites possess numerous outstanding features, such as a broad absorption range, high absorption coefficient, fast charge separation process, long diffusion length, and bipolar transport.1–3 With the rapid improvement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% in 2009 to 25.2% in 2020, PSCs have emerged as one of the most promising renewable power sources.1,4–6 Compared with conventional nanostructured PSCs, planar heterojunction cells have the advantages of a simple device architecture and easy fabrication process. In particular, the inversed p–i–n planar configuration exhibits negligible current density–voltage (J–V) hysteresis and good environmental stability.7 In such PSCs, the hole transport material (HTM) plays a critical role in determining the quality of the perovskite film, the extraction efficiency of holes, and the interfacial recombination of charge carriers. Poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been widely used as the HTM for organic photovoltaics and PSCs due to its low cost, easy processing, and good electronic conductivity.8,9 However, the highly acidic and hydrophilic nature of PEDOT:PSS can give rise to ITO erosion and perovskite decomposition, leading to poor device stability.10,11 Moreover, the shallow HOMO energy level of PEDOT:PSS (∼5.0 eV) may cause excessive energy loss at the HTM/perovskite interface, consequently lowering the open-circuit voltage (VOC).12 To overcome these drawbacks, several organic materials have been developed as the HTM of p–i–n-type PSCs, including poly(9-vinyl-carbazole), poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethyl-phenyl)amine), 4,4′-cyclohexylidene-bis[N,N-bis(4-methylphenyl)benzeneamine] and N,N′-bis(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)-benzidine.13–16
A conjugated polyelectrolyte (CPE) is frequently employed as an interlayer in organic and perovskite solar cells to improve the efficiency of the charge carrier collection through the interfacial dipole effect.17 An ultrathin and uniform layer of CPEs can be easily prepared on an ITO surface through a solution process, thus saving materials and reducing solar device manufacturing costs.18 Furthermore, the ionic groups on CPEs may provide a platform for manipulating the growth behavior of perovskite films. Therefore, the direct application of CPEs as the HTM of PSCs has gained considerable interest in recent years. Choi et al. replaced PEDOT:PSS with pH-neutral poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-potassiumbutanylsulfonate-4H-cyclopenta-[2,1-b;3,4-b′]-di-thiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] as the HTM, which improved the PCE from 10.7% to 12.5%.18 Li et al. applied a water soluble polyelectrolyte, poly[3-(4-carboxylatebutyl)thiophene] sodium salt, to a CH3NH3PbCl3−xIx perovskite system and achieved an average PCE of 15.4%.19 In addition, both poly(arylene-vinylene) and poly(triphenylamine-co-fluorene) based anionic polyelectrolytes were successfully employed as effective HTMs of inverted PSCs.20,21 Li et al. further reported that the aggregation morphology of polyelectrolytes markedly influences the performance of PSCs, and that the PCE can be optimized through counterion tailoring and solvent selection.22 Recently, Zhang et al. found that the use of methylammonium as the counterion of anionic poly[2,5-di(propoxy-3-sulfonate)-1,4-phenylene-alt-2,5-thiophene] not only improved the compatibility between the HTM and perovskite but also passivated the defects in the perovskite layer, resulting in enhanced PCE.23 To date, successful demonstrations of the use of CPEs as the HTM of PSCs have been dominated by anionic polyelectrolytes; cationic CPE-based HTMs are rarely reported,24 and the effects of the types of charges and ions in CPEs on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs have not yet been systematically investigated.
In this work, three CPEs were designed and synthesized on the basis of an identical conjugated backbone composed of 4,7-bis(thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole and fluorene units, with anchored –N(CH3)3+, –SO3−, and –NH3+ ions, namely BF-NMe3, BF-SO3 and, BF-NH3, respectively (Scheme 1). The electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole unit is used to downshift the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of CPEs. These CPEs and PEDOT:PSS were employed as HTMs to fabricate p–i–n-type planar heterojunction PSCs. All three PSCs based on the CPEs significantly outperform the PEDOT:PSS cell. The deep HOMO of CPEs effectively minimizes the energy loss occurring during the transfer of holes from methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPbI3) to the HTM and boosts the VOC. Interestingly, the cationic as well as anionic CPEs act excellently as the HTM. With the same conjugated backbone, the structure of the ion rather than the type of charge is the critical parameter affecting the growth behavior of MAPbI3. Perovskites with larger grain sizes and a longer exciton lifetime were generated on the surface of BF-NH3 and BF-SO3; consequently, the BF-NH3 based PSC exhibits a champion PCE of 17.7%.

Results and discussion
Scheme S1† depicts the synthetic routes of BF-NMe3, BF-SO3 and BF-NH3, and the detailed procedures are given in the ESI.† We characterized their chemical structures using 1H NMR and 13C NMR. Table S1† summarizes their molecular weight properties determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). Both BF-NH3 and BF-SO3 are soluble in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) but BF-NMe3 is soluble in highly polar solvents, such as methanol and 2-methoxyethanol (2-ME). Fig. S1† shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of these CPEs in solution and in a solid film. Due to the identical conjugated backbone, all three polymers have comparable spectra which comprised two absorption bands peaking at around 385 nm and 520 nm, corresponding to the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone and the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor (D) and acceptor (A) units, respectively.25 Casting these polymer solutions on a glass slide to form thin solid films appears to red-shift the long-wavelength peaks by 36 nm due to the close packing of the conjugated backbones. The images obtained from the optical microscope (Fig. S2†) and atomic force microscope (Fig. S3†) indicate that they can all form uniform films on top of the ITO glass, possessing very smooth surfaces with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of around 3 nm and no visible aggregates.
A series of inverted planar PSCs with a device structure of ITO/HTM/MAPbI3/PC61BM/PEI/Ag (Fig. 1a) were fabricated using the spin-coated films of BF-NMe3, BF-SO3 and BF-NH3 as the HTMs. The performance of these solar cells was optimized by varying the thicknesses of the HTMs and the resulting photovoltaic properties are summarized in Table S2.†Fig. 1b plots the current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized cells measured under AM 1.5G simulated solar light at one-sun intensity. For comparison, a PSC using PEDOT:PSS as the HTM was also fabricated. No apparent hysteresis was observed in the forward- and reverse-scan J–V curves of all the PSCs studied (Fig. S4†). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) distribution and the statistical data of the photovoltaic parameters from 15 devices are presented in Fig. S5† and Table 1, respectively. The PSCs based on the CPEs studied herein clearly outperform the control PEDOT:PSS device in terms of the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and the short-circuit current density (JSC). Replacing PEDOT:PSS with BF-NMe3, BF-SO3, and BF-NH3 as the HTM dramatically improves the PCE by 27%, 46%, and 53%, respectively. The champion BF-NH3 PSC exhibits a promising PCE of 17.7% with a VOC of 1.05 V, a Jsc of 20.1 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 84%. The stability of PSCs was evaluated at temperatures of 25 ± 2 °C and relative humidities of 25 ± 10%. Fig. S6† demonstrates that the replacement of PEDOT:PSS with the CPEs as the HTM significantly stabilizes the cell performance during long-term storage. The PCE of the unencapsulated PEDOT:PSS cell drops rapidly to ∼10% of its initial value, whereas the CPE-based devices retain ∼90% of their original PCE after 960 hours of storage.

The relative HOMO level positions of HTMs and the perovskite are an important factor in determining the hole extraction efficiency, the energy loss at the HTM/MAPbI3 interface, and thus the VOC of PSCs.19–21 The ionization energies of the three CPEs, PEDOT:PSS, MAPbI3, and PC61BM were measured using photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA). Fig. S7† shows the resulting PESA spectra, and Fig. 1c illustrates the energy level diagrams of the relevant components of the PSCs. The ionic groups have no clear influence on the ionization energy of the conjugated backbone, and the three CPEs have a similar value of ∼−5.40 eV, which is appreciably deeper than that of PEDOT:PSS (−5.20 eV). Hence, replacing PEDOT:PSS with the CPEs effectively reduces the energy offset between the HOMOs of the perovskite and HTM, thus leading to the increase of VOC. A close comparison of the photovoltaic properties of the CPE-based PSCs reveals that the VOC values of the BF-SO3 and BF-NH3 devices are about 4% higher than that of the BF-NMe3 device, although all three CPEs have almost an identical HOMO. This phenomenon will be discussed and explained in the next section.

Fig. 1d reveals the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSCs. All the devices based on CPEs show a similar shape of the spectra. The integrated JSC values extracted from the EQE spectra are 16.95, 18.86, 19.52 and 19.65 mA cm−2 for the PEDOT:PSS, BF-NMe3, BF-SO3 and BF-NH3 cells, respectively. These values align with the JSC values obtained from the J–V curves with deviations of less than 3%. As evidenced from the cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. 2a–d, the perovskite films in the four PSCs have comparable thicknesses of ∼300 nm. Moreover, Fig. S8† indicates that the photoactive layers of the ITO/HTM/perovskite have almost identical absorbance in the entire range of wavelengths, suggesting that the light-harvesting ability is not a major cause for the difference in JSC.

The SEM top-view images of the perovskite film on (e) PEDOT:PSS, (f) BF-NMe3, (g) BF-SO3 and (h) BF-NH3 coated ITO substrates. The scale bar for SEM images is 1 μm. 
The SEM top-view images in Fig. 2e–h demonstrate that the HTMs play a critical role in the morphology of the perovskite films. Since the components of MAPbI3 (MA+, Pb2+ and I−) are ionic species, the ionic moieties on the HTL may act as the nucleation sites for the growth of the perovskite. Therefore, the interaction between the ionic groups of CPEs and the perovskite is a crucial parameter affecting the crystal growth process. The MAPbI3 can grow into the largest grains on top of the BF-NH3 and BF-SO3 surfaces, while the smallest grains result from the PEDOT:PSS surface. The average grain sizes of MAPbI3 on PEDOT:PSS, BF-NMe3, BF-SO3 and BF-NH3 were estimated to be approximately 150, 204, 257 and 260 nm, respectively. Interestingly, the trend of the grain size is consistent with the trend of JSC.
As shown in Fig. S9,† the four perovskite films exhibit identical characteristic X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks; however, their intensities are very different, confirming the formation of the same crystal structure and the substantial impact of the HTM on the crystallinity of MAPbI3. The full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) values of the (110) peak at a diffraction angle of 2θ ∼ 14.5° were used to estimate the domain size of the crystals. They are 66.3, 68.4, 70.3 and 70.9 nm for the perovskites grown from the surface of PEDOT:PSS, BF-NMe3, BF-SO3 and BF-NH3 HTMs, respectively. Generally, larger grain and crystal sizes correspond to lower grain boundaries and fewer surface defects, which would benefit the photovoltaic performances of PSC devices.26

Fig. 3a shows the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the ITO/HTM/MAPbI3 samples, and the data were fitted with a sum of two exponential decay functions. Typically, the fast decay component τ1 is derived from the interfacial charge separation properties and the slow decay component τ2 is related to the nonradiative recombination properties in bulk.22 As shown in Table S3,† the perovskite films on the three CPEs have a comparable τ1 of around 2 ns, indicating that neither the type of charge nor the structure of the ion affects the ability of hole extraction of CPEs from MAPbI3. For the slow decay components, both the BF-NH3 and BF-SO3 samples have the longest τ2 of ∼11.3 ns, whereas the PEDOT:PSS sample has the shortest τ2 of around ∼4.5 ns; this result supports the order of the grain size of polycrystalline MAPbI3 observed in the SEM images (Fig. 2e–h). These findings demonstrate that the BF-NH3 and BF-SO3 HTMs promote the growth of MAPbI3 into relatively large crystals and grains that reduce surface defects and grain boundaries, and then suppress the nonradiative recombination of charge carriers, thus leading to improved JSC for the BF-NH3 and BF-SO3 PSCs.
 Fig. 3  (a) TRPL spectra of ITO/HTMs/MAPbI3 and (b) EIS Nyquist plot of the PSC devices. Note: the samples were excited from the air/perovskite side. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out at 10 mV AC voltage and a scanning frequency range of 1 Hz to 1 MHz under AM 1.5G illumination without an applied DC voltage,21 and the resulting Nyquist plots are displayed in Fig. 3b. The semicircle in the high frequency regime is attributed mainly to the impedance originating from the electron transport and charge recombination process; the long tail in the low frequency regime is attributed to the impedance originating from ion diffusion.23,26–29 At zero bias, the dominant charge transport mode is drift, and the measured resistance is dominated by charge recombination resistance.16,28–32 As shown in Fig. 3b, the diameter of the dotted semicircles decreases in the order BF-NH3 ≈ BF-SO3 > BF-NMe3 > PEDOT:PSS PSCs. This result evidently reveals that the problem of charge recombination is more serious in the PEDOT:PSS and BF-NMe3 devices than in the BF-NH3 and BF-SO3 devices. The relatively high recombination loss in the BF-NMe3 cell leads to a smaller VOC than those of the BF-NH3 and BF-SO3 cells, although all three CPEs have similar HOMO energy levels.23,31
Conclusions
Three CPEs with –N(CH3)3+, –SO3− and –NH3+ ions were synthesized via the Stille coupling of 4,7-di(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole and 2,7-dibromo-9H-fluorene monomers. These CPEs and PEDOT:PSS were utilized as HTMs to build inverted planar PSCs. The presence of an electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole unit effectively moves the HOMO of the conjugated backbone downwards and reduces the energy offset at the MAPbI3/HTM interface, leading to an increase in VOC. All three CPEs have similar capability to extract holes from a perovskite; however, the nature of the HTM plays an important role in the morphology of the perovskite layer. The largest grain and domain sizes of MAPbI3 with the fewest defects were obtained on top of the BF-NH3 and BF-SO3 substrates, but the smallest sizes of MAPbI3 with the shortest exciton lifetime were obtained on PEDOT:PSS. Therefore, the PSCs based on the three CPEs exhibit superior PCE to the PEDOT:PSS cell. In addition, the HTM drastically influences the charge recombination resistance inside solar cells, and such resistance increases in the order PEDOT:PSS < BF-NMe3 < BF-SO3 ≈ BF-NH3. As a result, the BF-NH3 PSC exhibits the best PCE of 17.7%. This study demonstrates that not only anionic but also cationic CPEs can function as excellent HTMs and provides insights into the design of new CPEs for developing high-performance PSCs.
