    , Accepted 29th November 2014First published on 3rd December 2014AbstractIt has been proven that growing longer nanowires (NWs) with larger surface areas is not always a feasible way to increase the conversion efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) because the photogenerated electrons and holes may have higher recombination rates as the electron travel distance increases. In this work, we employed a convenient hydrothermal selective etching method to convert single-crystalline rutile TiO2 NW arrays to nanotube (NT) arrays. The resulting NTs retain many characteristics of the initial unetched NWs, such as the orientation, crystal structure, and geometry size (in terms of length and outer diameter). When used as photoanode materials in DSSCs, the as-prepared TiO2 NTs have achieved 112.5% enhancement in the overall power conversion efficiency compared to the initial unetched NWs. The significantly improved performance is credited to 1) the newly created inner surfaces, 2) the increased surface roughness, and 3) the unchanged electron travel distance. Our findings shed light on a new, general way to enhance the performance of the current NW-based DSSCs by simply converting initial NWs to NTs.
Introduction
Since the publication of the seminal work by Grätzel in 1991,1 dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been recognized as one of the most promising alternatives to conventional silicon-based solar cells because of their low manufacturing cost, high power conversion efficiency, excellent stability and environmental friendliness. To date, state-of-the-art DSSCs have achieved the highest power conversion efficiency of over 13%.2 In DSSCs, typically, nanocrystalline porous TiO2 films are used as photoanodes and a dye is used as a sensitizer attached to the surface of TiO2 nanocrystals. When exposed to light, the dye molecules are excited and inject electrons into the conduction band of the TiO2 semiconductor films.3,4 It is well known that the photoanode is a crucial element in DSSCs because of its great influence on light harvesting, dye molecule absorption, and photogenerated electron transport and recombination. The large surface area of a TiO2 nanoparticle (NP) based photoanode allows sufficient loading of dye molecules, resulting in an increased current density.4,5 However, the disordered porous structure and large grain boundary of TiO2 NPs limit further improvement in the power conversion efficiency of DSSCs.6,7
Highly ordered one dimensional (1D) nanostructures, such as nanowires (NWs),8–10 nanorods (NRs)11 and nanotubes (NTs),12–14 have been studied as photoanodes in DSSCs because of their potential for increasing the charge transport capacity and suppressing photogenerated charge recombination.15 Several methods have been employed to synthesize 1D TiO2 NR/NW arrays, including chemical vapor deposition,9 template-assisted methods16 and hydrothermal methods.8 However, it is well known that the surface area of 1D TiO2 NRs/NWs is small, which limits dye attachment and leads to low current density. A number of methods have been developed to address this issue, one of which is to increase the length of TiO2 NRs/NWs,17 although it's not completely successful because the photogenerated electrons may recombine with holes when they travel a long distance to the substrates. Moreover, the increased thickness of the photoanode films may lead to incomplete permeation of the electrolyte, especially in the case of solid inorganic p-type semiconductors and organic hole-transport materials. Another option is to introduce hierarchical structures.18–20 The hierarchical arrays retain the characteristics of quasi-1D nanostructures: the trunks and branches have good connections and fewer grain boundaries, which allow electrons to be transported directly to the substrate.
Compared with TiO2 NWs/NRs, oriented TiO2 NTs exhibit a stronger competitive edge since they combine large surface areas with strong light-harvesting capacity. The fabrication techniques employed to synthesize polycrystalline TiO2 NT arrays include electrochemical anodization12,13 and template-assisted methods.14 While TiO2 NT arrays produced by anodizing titanium sheets have been used as photoanodes in DSSCs,13 such films are nontransparent and backside illumination is required. In 2005, Mor et al. synthesized TiO2 NT arrays on transparent conducting oxide (TCO) glass by sputtering a titanium film onto the TCO glass with subsequent anode oxidation.12 This configuration enables front-side illumination and has achieved a photocurrent efficiency of 2.90%.
Here, oriented single-crystalline rutile TiO2 NWs were synthesized by a hydrothermal method and then converted to TiO2 NTs by subsequent hydrothermal treatment. The surface area of the obtained TiO2 NTs is several times more than that of the initial TiO2 NWs. The morphology, crystal structure and growth mechanism of TiO2 NWs/NTs were investigated in detail by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). When used as photoanode materials in DSSCs, the as-prepared TiO2 NTs have achieved an overall power conversion efficiency of 3.40%, which is much higher than that of the initial unetched NWs (1.60%).
Experimental
Preparation of photoanodes
Fluorine-doped tin dioxide (FTO) (7–8 Ω sq−1) coated glass substrates were purchased from Yingkou OPV Tech New Energy Co., Ltd. The FTO coated glass substrates (1 cm × 2 cm) were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, ethanol and deionized water in sequence, each for 15 min, and then dried with nitrogen. The TiO2 NW arrays were prepared by a hydrothermal growth process in an aqueous solution of titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and hydrochloric acid (HCl). Typically, the FTO coated glass substrates were placed against the inner wall of the autoclave (200 mL capacity) filled with a 30 mL mixture solution of H2O, concentrated HCl (36 wt%) and TiCl4 (volume ratio is 25:25:0.6, respectively). After that, the sealed autoclave was kept in a drying oven at 140 °C for 12 h. The obtained samples were alternatively rinsed with ethanol and deionized water several times and then air dried at room temperature. Subsequently, the TiO2 NT arrays were obtained through a second-step hydrothermal reaction. To be specific, the TiO2 NW arrays were immersed in 15 mL of HCl solution (6.67 M) and kept at 150 °C for 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h. Finally, the products were annealed at 450 °C for 30 min.
Device fabrication
The fabricated photoanodes were immersed in ethanol solution containing 0.5 mM N719 ruthenium dye and sensitized for 24 h at room temperature. The sensitized films were rinsed with ethanol to remove the unabsorbed N719 dye molecules and then air dried at room temperature. The dye-sensitized TiO2 NWs or NTs films were assembled into a typical sandwich-type cell, with platinum-coated FTO glass as the counter electrode. I−/I3− based electrolyte (0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.06 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate and 0.5 M tert-butyl-pyridine (TBP)) in acetonitrile was injected into the space between the sandwiched cells. The active area of each dye-sensitized TiO2 film was 0.1 cm2.
Characterization
The morphology and structure of the samples were observed by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, ZEISS ULTRA 55), a TEM (JEOL 2100F, 200 kV) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer, and an XRD (Rigaku, MiniFlex600, Cu Kα, λ = 0.15406 nm, 40 kV, Japan). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were obtained by using an AM 1.5 solar simulator (Abet Model 11000, light intensity is 100 mW cm−2) as a light source, calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell. A UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-2550) was employed to investigate the amounts of the dye absorbed by the TiO2 photoanodes. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the samples were obtained using VersaSTAT 3-400 (Princeton Applied Research) electrochemical workstations.
Results and discussion
The morphologies of the obtained TiO2 NW and NT arrays on FTO substrates were characterized by SEM. Fig. 1a shows a top-view SEM image of the TiO2 NWs grown directly on the substrate. The diameters of the NWs are 200–300 nm. After hydrothermal etching for 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h (as shown in Fig. 1b–d, respectively), it can be observed that the TiO2 NWs gradually convert into TiO2 NTs with the cores being etched but with the sidewalls still remaining. The conversion process is also schematically illustrated in Scheme 1. As shown in Fig. 2a, the TiO2 NWs grown directly on the FTO substrate are ~3.5 μm in length. It can be observed that the NWs possess particularly smooth sidewalls (Fig. 2b). The microstructure of the TiO2 NWs was further characterized by TEM analysis. Fig. 2c is a typical TEM image of a TiO2 NW ~300 nm in diameter, which agrees with the SEM observation. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Fig. 2d) shows that the TiO2 NW is single-crystalline over its entire length and grows along the [001] direction. Fig. 2e displays a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) image taken from the tip of one TiO2 NW (marked in Fig. 2c), which also confirms the single crystalline structure of the NWs. The interplanar spacing d110 = 0.32 nm and d001 = 0.29 nm is in excellent agreement with the rutile phase. SEM (Fig. 1a) and HRTEM (Fig. 2e) characterization reveals that the TiO2 NW tip is composed of a bundle of nanocolumns, which are 15–20 nm in diameter and fit closely together. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) mapping analysis of elements O and Ti (shown in Fig. 2g–h, respectively) from a TiO2 NW (Fig. 2f) confirms its composition and structure.

As depicted in Scheme 1, the TiO2 NTs were synthesized by hydrothermal selective etching of TiO2 NWs. The etching results were also observed by SEM (Fig. 1a–d). When TiO2 NWs were etched in 6.67 M HCl at 150 °C for 2 h, it can be clearly seen from the SEM image that the NWs started to corrode from the top (as shown in Fig. 1b) but the sidewalls remained. When the etching time increased, the etching of the cores of TiO2 NWs continued. Fig. 3a and b show the side-view SEM images of completely hollow TiO2 NTs obtained by etching at 150 °C for 6 h, whose inner diameter and length are ~200 nm and ~3.5 μm, respectively. The geometric parameters of the TiO2 NTs correspond to those of the initial unetched TiO2 NWs. A typical TEM image of the TiO2 NT is shown in Fig. 3c, which clearly shows the hollowness of the NT. The red arrows in Fig. 3b and c indicate the axial directions of the hollow NTs for better illustration. It is obvious that, in addition to the new inner surfaces, the NT surfaces are rougher than those of NWs when the SEM (Fig. 2b and 3b) and TEM (Fig. 2c and 3c) images are closely compared. The panoramic and close view SEM images of a broken NT are shown in Fig. 3d and f, respectively, which clearly show that the sidewall of the NT consists of a number of nanocolumns (15–20 nm in diameter). The SAED pattern of the entire NT (Fig. 3e) shows that the TiO2 NT is still single-crystalline and its growth direction is still along the [001] direction. Fig. 3g displays a HRTEM image taken from the tip of the TiO2 NT (marked in Fig. 3f). It reveals that the TiO2 NT sidewall retains the single crystalline structure after the etching process. The EDS mapping images of elements O and Ti (shown in Fig. 3i and j, respectively) from a single TiO2 NT (Fig. 3h) also confirm the hollow structure.

The growth mechanism of the TiO2 NWs and NTs is discussed below. Firstly, TiO2 NW arrays were synthesized on FTO substrates through a hydrothermal growth process in aqueous solution of TiCl4 and HCl. The growth process of TiO2 nanowires is subject to a reversible reaction: TiCl4 + 2H2O ↔ TiO2 + 4HCl. In this process, TiO2 NWs with four sidewalls bound by (110) planes formed because the (110) facets have the lowest surface energy. In the subsequent etching process, hydrothermal treatment of TiO2 NW arrays was performed in a solution containing 6.67 M HCl. Because of the absence of TiCl4 (Ti precursor), the backward reaction becomes dominant. The etching rate of the (001) core of rutile TiO2 NWs is much faster than that of the (110) sidewalls because the surface energy of the (110) facet is much lower than that of the (001) facet.21,22 Generally, the facet with higher surface energy will diminish faster during etching to minimize the total surface energy. Therefore, the solid NWs can be converted into hollow TiO2 NTs in this selective etching process. Obviously, the surface area of the obtained TiO2 NTs is much larger than that of the initial TiO2 NWs. Fig. 4 displays the XRD patterns of the TiO2 NWs and NTs (obtained by etching of NWs for 6 h) on FTO substrates. Fig. 4a is the diffraction pattern of the FTO substrate. All of the diffraction peaks of the TiO2 NWs (Fig. 4b) and NTs (Fig. 4c) agree with the rutile phase according to the PDF card (JCPDS no. 88-1175, a = b = 0.4517 nm and c = 0.2940 nm). The strongest peak (002) in the TiO2 NWs significantly decreases after converting to TiO2 NTs by hydrothermal etching, which indicates that the cores have significantly corroded.

The rutile NW arrays with 0, 2, 4 and 6 h etching treatment were explored as photoanode materials in DSSCs. To simplify, the DSSCs assembled with these photoanodes are marked as NW, NT-2 h, NT-4 h and NT-6 h. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs were measured under 100 mW cm−2 illumination, as shown in Fig. 5. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters including the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (η) are listed in Table 1. The overall power conversion efficiency (η) was calculated using the following equation: (1)where Pin is the incident light power density. The efficiencies of the DSSCs based on different photoanodes are 1.60, 2.32, 3.16 and 3.40%. As is well known, higher efficiencies are mainly attributed to higher Jsc values. Actually, the Jsc value is closely related to the amount of the dye loaded on the TiO2 photoanodes. The dye absorption amounts of different photoanodes were calculated by using the Beer–Lambert law according to the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 6): (2)where A is the absorbance at a particular wavelength, T is the transmitted–incident intensity ratio, K is the molar absorptivity, c is the concentration of the desorption dyes in solution, and L is the internal diameter of the spectrophotometer cell. As summarized in Table 1, the dye amounts absorbed by the NW, NT-2 h, NT-4 h and NT-6 h photoanodes are 11.7, 13.7, 30.9 and 37.2 nmol cm−2, respectively. These results indicate that the surface areas of the photoanode films are in the ascending sequence of NW < NT-2 h < NT-4 h < NT-6 h. The increased surface areas are due to the newly created inner surfaces and the significantly increased surface roughness of NTs. So, the increase in the effective total surface areas of TiO2 nanotubes should be much more than double. Actually, based on the fact that dye loading rises from 11.7 nmol cm−2 to 37.2 nmol cm−2, it can be inferred that the total surface area increased by 218% after etching. As a result, the increased dye loading amounts of those with larger surface areas clearly contribute to the enhanced Jsc and higher DSSC efficiencies.

To obtain additional information about the interfacial characteristics such as charge transport and recombination in these cells, EIS measurements were carried out. In Fig. 7, Nyquist plots of the relevant cells are presented. Generally, two semicircles are observed in the Nyquist diagram of the DSSCs with TiO2 NWs or NTs as photoanodes. The sheet resistance (Rs) is attributed to the internal ohmic resistance. The first small semicircle (R1) in the high frequency region corresponds to the charge transfer resistance at the interface of the counter electrode/electrolyte, while the large semicircle (R2) in the low frequency region corresponds to the charge transfer resistance at the interface of the photoanode/electrolyte. As shown in Table 1, all cells based on different photoanodes have similar Rs and R1 values, which is due to their having the same electrode materials. However, as the time of hydrothermal etching of TiO2 NW arrays increases, the charge transfer resistance (R2) decreases (43.7, 40.6, 37.6 and 34.3 Ω for NW, NT-2 h, NT-4 h and NT-6 h, respectively), indicating enhancement of the recombination of electrons with I3− within such DSSCs. This can be attributed to the increased surface area which provides additional recombination sites for photogenerated electrons and I3− in the electrolyte. The decrease in the charge transfer resistance can result in fast recombination reactions (or a shorter electron lifetime), leading to smaller values of Voc, which is in line with the above photovoltaic data.20,23

Conclusions
In this work, we employed a hydrothermal selective etching method to convert TiO2 NW arrays to NT arrays, which were then applied as photoanodes in DSSCs. Our investigation revealed that the resulting TiO2 NTs retain many characteristics of the initial NWs, such as the orientation, geometry size and crystal structure. However, compared with TiO2 NW arrays, the TiO2 NT arrays show a significant increase in the photocurrent density, which is credited to 1) the newly created inner surfaces, 2) the increased surface roughness, and 3) the unchanged electron travel distance. The as-prepared TiO2 NT arrays have achieved an overall power conversion efficiency of 3.40%, ~112.5% higher than that of the DSSCs based on the initial NW arrays (1.60%). Our findings provide a new way to further improve the overall efficiency of current NW-based DSSCs by simply converting the initial NWs to NTs.
