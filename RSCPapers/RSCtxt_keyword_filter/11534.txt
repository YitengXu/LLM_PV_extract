Here, we demonstrate the production of low-temperature solution-processed perovskite solar cells (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PC61BM/Ca/Ag) with hysteresis-free current–voltage characteristics, excellent photostability, and high reproducibility via the inclusion of methyl ammonium chloride (MACl) using the interdiffusion method. The best-performing devices exhibited a power conversion efficiency of over 12%. Our devices showed promising stability by maintaining more than 90% of their initial performance over long periods of time at ambient conditions with encapsulation using common techniques, as well as no obvious degradation after 2 h of continuous light exposure. We statistically compared fabrication processes using the interdiffusion method with or without MACl by creating a histogram of over 120 devices for each method. The results clearly indicated that including MACl gave better reproducibility and a higher average efficiency of 9.5%, as well as improved device stabilities.
Introduction
Organic/inorganic hybrid solar cells based on metal-halide perovskite are considered promising candidates for third-generation photovoltaics because of their efficient photovoltaic performance, simple processing conditions, and comparatively low cost.1–7 Kojima et al.2 published the first report of a perovskite-based dye-sensitized solar cell with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%, but rapid progress in this area in the last 5 years has now increased the PCE to more than 15%.3–8 Initially, state-of-the-art perovskite-based devices used a metal-oxide porous scaffold (TiO2, Al2O3, and ZnO).4,6,9,10 However, in later reports, device processing was simplified by using a planar configuration to avoid the crucial penetration of perovskite into the porous layers.3,7 To date, different deposition techniques, such as single step11 two-step,4 and vapor deposition3 methods, have been employed to fabricate these devices. Nevertheless, the use of oxide materials as electron-selective layers generally requires high-temperature processing.
Another direction of growing research into perovskite solar devices involves low-temperature solution-processable electron- and hole-transport materials, which have been commonly used in organic photovoltaics (OPVs).5,12–15 The first work on a perovskite solar cell with structures similar to the OPV devices was reported by Jeng et al.,12 using [poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly-(styrenesulfonic acid)] (PEDOT:PSS) as a hole-transporting layer and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as an electron-selective layer in planar heterojunction configuration. However, PCE was limited to 3.9% owing to the difficulty in forming the uniform perovskite films on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. Later, Docampo et al.13 demonstrated improved PCE (up to 10%) by using an inverted device structure on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO); they speculated that the smooth surface of the indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate was unfavorable for uniform spreading of the perovskite layer. Nevertheless, advancements in the development of ITO-based devices achieved efficiencies of over 15% by using the interdiffusion process developed by Xiao et al.,5 which, unlike the sequential dipping method, provides a homogenous layer of perovskite for planar devices. Another report by Chiang et al. on the interdiffusion method16 demonstrated efficiencies of up to 16.31%; this enhancement in efficiency was attributed to the better electron mobility of PC71BM compared with that of PC61BM.
Since the development of perovskite photovoltaic devices, a huge amount of attention has been paid to increasing their efficiency. However, inadequate stability remains a central challenge to the adoption of perovskite photovoltaics. Producing hysteresis-free devices with sustainable performance seems to be essential for future progress in the development of perovskite solar cells. Devices with hysteresis behaviors in J–V responses show a large discrepancy between the forward and reverse scans, resulting in considerable errors in evaluating the solar cell efficiencies.7,17,18 For example, the results reported by Zhou et al.7 showed a large degree of hysteresis in device performance (16.79% efficiency in reverse scan and 13.08% in forward scan), and device performance deteriorated after a very short time.
A study by Kim and Park19 showed that the degree of hysteresis depends strongly on the perovskite crystal size and the presence of the mesoporous layer. Very recently, Unger et al.20 presented a detailed study of the hysteresis effect and suggested that the transient behavior of perovskite photovoltaic devices can be influenced by the stoichiometry of the perovskite material, as well as by the degree of crystallinity and the size of the crystalline domains. Although a wide number of fabrication methods4–6,11 have been investigated, it is difficult to find one optimized method that can ensure both high quality of the perovskite absorber without anomalous hysteresis behavior and unperturbed device performance with long-term stability.
Here, we demonstrate solar devices that were prepared by using a low-temperature-solution process and have hysteresis-free current–voltage characteristics and excellent long-term stability. Our devices show promising stability by maintaining more than 90% of their initial performance over a long period of time at ambient conditions when encapsulated by using a common method. Indeed, this degree of device stabilities allowed us to quantitatively analyze the perovskite photovoltaic cells by using analytical models and impedance spectroscopy (IS); the J–V measurements were perfectly consistent with a simple diode model, and the IS in darkness and under illumination revealed a very slow process reminiscent of hopping conductions.21 In this study, we compared the photovoltaic properties and stability of two different lead-halide perovskite devices (i.e. MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx) fabricated by using the interdiffusion method.5,16 Many studies have used mixed iodide/chloride in the perovskite film formation to improve film qualities, and the role of the chlorine has been a topic of much debate.22–25 We found that improved film morphology could be achieved by adding a small amount of methyl ammonium chloride (MACl) to the methyl ammonium iodide (MAI) solution in the interdiffusion process to produce Cl-doped MAPbI3−xClx devices instead of MAPbI3 ones. This combination of a doping approach with the interdiffusion method yields smoother perovskite films that have greater reproducibility and photostability. By employing this method, we found that the best-performing device had a PCE of 12.3% (device area 0.08 cm2). A statistical study of the fabrication of more than 240 devices with and without MACl unambiguously revealed the advantage of Cl-doped MAPbI3−xClx devices. We also report our detailed analysis of the hysteresis-free behaviors of our devices, as evaluated by using hysteresis index approaches, and the results of stability testing under continuous light exposure (1 sun) for 2 h and in ambient conditions over 2 months.
Experimental section
Materials and characterization
All chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers and used as received unless stated otherwise. PbI2 (Sigma Aldrich, 99%) and methyl ammonium iodide (MAI) (Wako Chem., 98%) were dissolved in anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (Wako chem., 99.5%) (400 mg ml−1) and anhydrous 2-propanol (Wako chem.) (50 mg ml−1), respectively. For chlorine doping, 5–20 wt% MACl (Wako chem.) was mixed with the MAI solution. PC61BM (Solenne or Lumitec, 99%) solution (2 wt%) dissolved in anhydrous chlorobenzene (Wako chem., 99%) was used for coating of the electron selective layer. All the solutions were filtered using 0.45 μm syringe filters to avoid the risk of particle formation. UV-curable resins (NagaseChemtex XNR5516Z) were used to seal devices with cavity glasses. The X-ray diffraction patterns of MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx were collected using Bruker D8 advanced X-ray diffractometer (CuKα radiation, λ = 1.54050 Å). The top surface and cross-sectional images were taken by a high resolution scanning electron microscope at 5 kV accelerating voltage (Hitachi-4800). Additionally, elemental mapping was done using energy dispersive X-ray measurement mode at accelerating voltage of 10 kV. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics under 1 sun with an AM 1.5G spectral filter (100 mW cm−2, calibrated with a Si reference cell, emission spectrum in Fig. S9†) and incident monochromatic photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra or External quantum efficiency (EQE) were measured with a CEP-200BX spectrometer (Bunkokeiki, Tokyo, Japan) at room temperature. To investigate the hysteresis behaviour scan rates were varied from 0.02 to 0.3 V s−1. Histogram of over 240 devices were generated from the devices using 0.18 cm2 aperture mask.
Device fabrication
Solar cell devices were fabricated on pre-cleaned patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrates (15 Ω square−1). The ITO substrates were pre-cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with detergent, pure water, and 2-propanol, and then treated in an ultraviolet-ozone chamber for at least 10 min to remove the organic residuals. A thin layer (∼30 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios, AI4083) was formed by spin coating at 3000 rpm and subsequently dried at 140 °C for 10 min on a hot plate under air. Substrates were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box (<1.0 ppm O2 and H2O) for PbI2 and MAI coatings. Firstly, PbI2 was spin coated on to the top of PEDOT:PSS layer at 3000 rpm for about 30 s. After drying at 70 °C for 30 min, MAI solutions with different MACl weight percentages were spun on to the PbI2 layer at 4000 rpm, 30 s. These PbI2/MAI samples were heated at 100 °C for 2 hours for the complete conversion into perovskite. Finally, a PC61BM layer was spun on the perovskite layer at 700 rpm for 60 s. Samples were then transferred into the evaporation chamber, connected to the glove box for metal contact deposition. A 4 nm thin layer of Ca and 100 nm of Ag were deposited by thermal evaporation at a pressure <10−4 Pa. This process provided devices with 4.0 × 7.5 mm2, and they are sealed using the UV-curable resin before the subsequent measurements in ambient conditions with an aperture mask of 0.08 to 0.18 cm2.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 is a simplified energy-band diagram of the solar cells used in this work. The perovskite layer was deposited by using the interdiffusion method, and then the PC61BM layer was deposited via a spin-coating method, instead of the vacuum evaporation technique used previously;5 thus a more attractive solution-based fabrication process was used. An ultra-thin layer of calcium (Ca) in conjugation with silver (Ag) was evaporated as the back contact to complete the device structure. The combination of low-work-function Ca and Ag was used to obtain better ohmic contacts at the cathode interface.26

To investigate the structural evolution of the device, XRD patterns of MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx films were recorded before annealing and after 10 min and 2 h of annealing at 100 °C (Fig. 2). For comparison, all the diffraction patterns were plotted at the same intensity scale. The main diffraction peaks at 2θ positions 14.04° and 28.42° were assigned to the (110) and (220) diffraction planes of MAPbI3,3,12,27 whereas the broad hump at about 20° corresponded to the ITO/glass substrate. Interestingly, before annealing, MAPbI3 films had almost negligible features, whereas a prominent peak corresponding to the (220) plane of the tetragonal perovskite structure was clearly apparent in the case of MAPbI3−xClx films. Before the annealing, the presence of a small peak of PbI2 on both films suggested incomplete reactions. After annealing at 100 °C for 10 min, samples of both MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx gave identical XRD patterns, although the patterns differed slightly in intensity scale. When we increased the annealing time to 2 h there was no further improvement in the case of the MAPbI3 film, whereas the XRD pattern of the MAPbI3−xClx film showed a marked increase in intensity of the (110) and (220) planes.

The increase in the intensity ratio of the (110) to (220) planes in the case of MAPbI3−xClx—from 2.25 to 2.62—after 2 h of annealing is a possible indication of chlorine ion-assisted slow growth along the preferred (110) orientation. The crystallite sizes (L) of the MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx films were estimated by using the Scherrer formula,28 given by L = (0.9λ)/(βcosθ), where λ = 0.154 nm for CuKα radiation and β is the full width at half maximum of the diffraction peak, in radians. Crystallite sizes for MAPbI3−xClx (95 nm) were greater than those MAPbI3 (70 nm).
These different evolutions of the XRD patterns of the MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx films suggested that there were two distinct reaction–crystallization processes. In the case of MAPbI3, the reaction was barely initiated before annealing, whereas within 10 min of the start of annealing the reaction crystallization had proceeded rapidly and was complete, with no further changes between then and 2 h. On the other hand, in the case of MAPbI3−xClx, the reaction started before annealing, but after the initial reaction the process slowed and completed within 2 h. For the one-step coating process with PbCl2 and MAI on PEDOT:PSS surfaces, the existence of chlorine have shown striking effect on the microstructure and orientation of perovskite films through the templated topotactic self-assemblies.23 Although large differences can be expected between the one-step method and the interdiffusion method employed in this study, the presence of chlorine can effectively alter the course of crystallization processes and may improve the orientational order and degree of crystallinity. The increased crystal size in MAPI3−xClx can reduce charge trapping and recombination at grain boundaries, thereby improving the fill factor (FF) owing to better film formation and hence a reduction in the number of shunting paths.29 Noticeably, the absence of any intermediate impurity phases even before annealing suggests that a chlorine-assisted interdiffusion method is capable of producing high-quality MAPbI3Cl3−x films. Another point is that continuous and smooth perovskite films were obtained on the crystalline PbI2 films (Fig. S1†). Therefore, the extra effort of preparing an amorphous or conformal PbI2 layer, which generally requires the PbI2 solution or ITO substrate, or both, to be heated during the deposition process,5 can be avoided by using this method.
We carefully inspected the morphological changes in the MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx perovskite films by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) before and after PC61BM coating (Fig. 3). Top and cross-sectional views of the MAPbI3 layer without the PC61BM coating are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. Large variations in crystallite size with islands of sub-micron size can be seen clearly all over the surface (Fig. 3(a)). Although the average thickness of the perovskite layer seems to be uniform, the presence of these random structures on the surface (marked by circles, Fig. 3(b)) increases the possibility of current leakage occurring through piercing of the thin PC61BM layer to the cathode. In contrast, we were able to produce very smooth, continuous, and pin-hole-free perovskite films by using the interdiffusion method with a mixture of both MACl and MAI, as seen in the top and cross-sectional views (Fig. 3(c) and (d), respectively). It was possible that the rough features on top of the perovskite layer could be smoothened by being covered with the slightly thicker PC61BM layer. However, this was not the case with MAPbI3, as the sharp features on the perovskite surface were still visible even after the addition of a 70 nm-thick PC61BM layer (Fig. 3(e)). As expected, MAPbI3−xClx gave smooth films both before and after PC61BM coating (Fig. 3(f)). These random morphological and crystallite size features can affect the device's performance. By performing electron beam-induced current profiling, Edri et al.30 found a uniform current distribution throughout MAPbI3−xClx-based solar cells but a grain-dependent current distribution in MAPbI3 cells. The enhanced Jsc value of MAPbI3−xClx that we found here was in good agreement with these previous observations.

Solution-processed perovskite solar cells are highly sensitive to crystallization conditions such as the choice of precursors, concentrations, solvents, annealing temperatures, and annealing times. A small variation in structural and morphological properties can lead to a huge step-down in device performance. In our experience, without the MACl, it was difficult to obtain better control of film formation even though the synthesis process was optimized by adjusting several parameters such as the precursor concentration, spin speed, solution dispensing method (static or dynamic dispensing of spin coatings), and annealing temperature or duration (or both). Although comparable PCEs were achieved in some attempts, the reproducibility of the MAPbI3 devices was poorer than that of the Cl-doped MAPbI3−xClx devices. The Cl-doped perovskite films showed consistently improved crystalline structure and morphology, irrespective of small variations in PbI2 or MAI concentrations and spin-coating methods. A cross-sectional view of a MAPbI3−xClx film, with the estimated thickness of each layer, is shown in Fig. 4(a). The thicknesses of the PEDOT:PSS, MAPbI3−xClx, and PC61BM layers were ∼30 nm, ∼245 nm, and ∼70 nm, respectively.

We also evaluated the amounts of chlorine atoms left in the MAPbI3−xClx films by measuring the ratio of chlorine to iodine using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). The amount of chlorine, however, seemed to be below the sensitivity limit of the instrument. We also conducted a XPS depth-profiling analysis by etching the film surface step by step up to a depth of ∼50 nm (Fig. S2†); a small hump was observed at the Cl-2p core level position. Although the inherently weak signal from chlorine compared with that of iodine meant that we had insufficient reliable information, we concluded that the chlorine content of the bulk film was likely of the order of 1% and that, on the basis of the depth profiles, the chlorine was not segregated on the surface. Considering the results of other studies, however, it seemed reasonable to have such low chlorine concentrations in our devices because only small amounts of chlorine (in the range of 2% to 4%) have been detected, even in films prepared from precursors with much greater chlorine contents (MAI:PbCl2, 3:1).31,32 Furthermore, we made another attempt at elemental mapping by using energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) measurement (Fig. 4(b)). Traces of chlorine signals were observed in the MACl-doped samples, and the chlorine signal consistently increased with increasing MACl concentration in the MAI solution (ESI Table S1†). Note that only qualitative information can be obtained from EDX analyses. Nevertheless, it was clear that the amount of chlorine incorporated into the perovskite structure was far less than the nominal composition of up to 20% MACl mixed in the MAI solution that was spread on the surface. Indeed, recent studies clearly revealed sublimation and loss of chlorine contents under mild annealing conditions below 100 °C.22
In response to the very different XRD results for the non-annealed MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx films (see Fig. 2 and the discussions thereafter), we compared the morphologies of MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx before annealing (Fig. S3†). MAPbI3 perovskite films have a very rough surface and non-uniform thickness, possibly because of the presence of unreacted MAI or PbI2 on the surface. In contrast, the highly compact and smooth nature of the layer in the Cl-doped perovskite films implied that adding a small amount of MACl to the MAI solution had a huge impact on the structure and morphology of the non-annealed perovskite layer. SEM comparison of the features of PbI2, PbI2/MAPbI3, and PbI2/MAPbI3−xClx films revealed the formation of a continuous film with a morphology resembling that of the underneath PbI2 layer in the case of Cl-doped perovskite (Fig. S4†); this was in contrast to the morphology of the MAPbI3 perovskite film, with its sub-micron-size random features.
It is well known that the crystallinity and morphology of the perovskite layer determine the ultimate performance of the device, as non-uniformity causes current leakage and defects cause the development of trapping sites for charge recombination. Fig. 5(a) shows the J–V curves for MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx devices (device size, 0.18 cm2) prepared in the same batch. We observed a clear correlation between morphology and the device parameters, as evident from the substantial improvement in photovoltaic parameters in MAPbI3−xClx devices. Both interdiffusion methods—with or without the chlorine doping—worked well, and in both cases the PCEs reached almost 12% in our hands. These results paralleled those of original reports on the interdiffusion method using vapor-deposited fullerenes (PCE 15.4%) or spin-coated PC61BM (PCE 9.92%).16 However, we found that, generally, devices prepared by using the Cl-doped interdiffusion method had better performances. We obtained statistical insight into the process of fabrication using the MAPbI3−xClx and MAPbI3 films by creating a histogram of the PCEs of 120 devices for each film type (Fig. 5(b)). The results clearly indicated that the MAPbI3−xClx devices gave better reproducibility, with a higher average efficiency of 9.5%, whereas the MAPbI3 devices had a broad and lower distribution of efficiencies. Furthermore, detailed analysis of the J–V curves for each device revealed, as a general trend, a decrease in series resistance and an increase in shunt resistance in the case of the MAPbI3−xClx devices. As a result, a marked improvement in FF was observed in the case of MAPbI3−xClx devices; this was ascribable to the relatively small number of grain boundaries and lack of leakage paths in the homogenous perovskite films. The improvement in FF could also be related to the high carrier mobility of chlorine-doped devices.1,33 The IPCE spectra for the devices were also compared (Fig. 5(c)). MAPbI3−xClx devices had IPCEs slightly superior to those of MAPbI3 devices. The IPCE peaked at about 75% at wavelengths of 430 to 540 nm and 670 nm, consistent with other reports.33,34 Integrated Jsc values of 16.90 and 17.58 mA cm−2 were obtained for MAPbI3−xClx and MAPbI3, respectively; these were in good agreement with the photocurrent densities obtained from the J–V curves.

We also verified the dependence of PCE on perovskite device size. It is generally more convenient (but less reliable) to achieve higher efficiency in smaller devices, as one can better avoid defects or pinholes using smaller devices, which also have fewer conductivity problems than with the larger transparent electrodes in larger devices. However, there are more errors in the smaller apertures used with smaller devices. To compare our devices (0.18 cm2) with those in other published works using smaller cells (0.04 to 0.1 cm2), the performance of the champion cell was recorded with different apertures ranging from 0.08 to 0.18 cm2 (Fig. S5†). Device performances as a function of aperture size are summarized in Table S2.† The slight variation in Jsc and/or Voc with different aperture sizes may reflect inhomogeneity of the films at a microscopic scale. As expected, smaller cells showed increased performance, with up to 12.25% efficiency. Although our efficiencies are not among the best reported, notably, we were able to obtain high FFs (above 0.7) for more than half of the devices fabricated at a size of 0.18 cm2 (Fig. S6†).
Although substantial attention has been paid to achieving high efficiency, anomalous J–V hysteresis behavior has been not fully disclosed on many occasions in earlier reports. Device performance can depend markedly on voltage sweep rate or direction, or both. To investigate the hysteresis behavior of our MAPbI3−xClx devices, we measured their J–V characteristics at different scan rates from 0.02 to 0.3 V s−1 in the forward (−0.2 to 1.2 V) and reverse (1.2 to −0.2 V) directions (Fig. 6). The origin of hysteresis in perovskite-absorber devices has been assigned to the slow dynamic processes originating from the trapping and detrapping of charge carriers, as well as to changes in absorber or contact conductivity, ferroelectricity, and ion migration.17–20 All of these effects appear to be related to the structural quality of the perovskite layer. The absence of hysteresis in our devices suggests that the fabrication method presented here is good enough to prevent such anomalous behaviors in devices. To obtain more quantitative information on J–V hysteresis, we estimated a hysteresis index (HI) by using the equation19  where JRS (0.8Voc) and JFS (0.8Voc) represent the photocurrent density at 80% of Voc for the reverse scan (RS) and forward scan (FS), respectively. A histogram of 80 devices (Fig. S7†) revealed that one-third of our devices had HI values below 0.1; this was a far better result than in other reports. In fact, this degree of near-absence of hysteresis allowed us to quantitatively analyze the perovskite photovoltaic cells by using analytical models and impedance spectroscopy (IS).21

We further examined the photostability of our devices under illumination (1 sun) (Fig. 7(a)). Devices were operated alternately between short and open circuit conditions under continuous illumination. No degradation of the MAPbI3−xClx devices was found during 2 h of operation, revealing a high degree of stability. In contrast, the MAPbI3 devices showed a gradual decrease in Jsc in the same photostability testing. Similarly, higher stability for devices using PbCl2 as lead source, instead of non-Cl containing Pb(OAc)2, has been reported,35 which is another example of the positive effect gained by the inclusion of chlorine species. More interestingly (Fig. S8†), hysteresis-free J–V behavior lasted for more than 1 month in the case of MAPbI3−xClx devices, revealing the high degree of stability of perovskite solar cells prepared by using the Cl-doped interdiffusion method.

Halide perovskites can be very sensitive to moisture and easily decomposed because of the highly hygroscopic nature of the amine salts.36 Therefore, the stability of perovskite photovoltaic devices is usually poor under ambient atmosphere, limiting the use of these devices in practical applications without encapsulation. We investigated the aging of our devices stored under ambient atmosphere by using a common method of encapsulation with cavity glass and UV-curable resin. The PCE of MAPbI3−xClx devices retained 90% of its initial value for almost 2 months in some cases (Fig. 7(b)). Possible mechanisms behind the deterioration after 2 months are degradation at the PEDOOT:PSS–perovskite interface as a result of the acidic or hygroscopic nature of PEDOT:PSS, or oxidation of the thin Ca layers at the cathode contact. Further optimization of interface materials will be needed to replace these materials and produce perovskite photovoltaic devices with practical durability.
In summary, we demonstrated low-temperature solution-processed perovskite photovoltaic devices with hysteresis-free J–V characteristics and excellent long-term stability. Our devices showed promising stability by maintaining more than 90% of their initial performance over 2 months at ambient conditions when we used a common method of encapsulation in cavity glass and UV-curable resin. We compared the photovoltaic properties and stabilities of two different lead-halide perovskite devices (i.e. MAPbI3 and MAPbI3−xClx) fabricated (size 0.18 cm2) by using the interdiffusion method. Inclusion of chlorine in the interdiffusion method effectively enhanced the stability and reproducibility of the devices in comparison with those of MAPbI3 devices. The key factors that improved the performance of MAPbI3−xClx devices were better crystallinity and homogeneity and pin hole-free coverage of the perovskite films, as revealed by XRD and SEM observations. Further improvements in device performance are anticipated through rational interface engineering.
