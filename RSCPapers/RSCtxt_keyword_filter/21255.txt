    , Accepted 18th February 2019First published on 8th March 2019AbstractFlexible solar cells represent a unique field in which hybrid perovskites may find complementary application to silicon solar cells. However, significant challenges in the fabrication of electron transport layers and hole transport layers at low temperatures have been imposed for perovskite solar cells since flexible substrates typically cannot withstand high processing temperatures (>150 °C). In this study, a low-temperature (140 °C) processed SnO2 layer was adopted as the electron transport layer in perovskite solar cells on a flexible PEN (polyethylene naphthalate) substrate, and a fullerene derivative with a carboxylic group (CPTA) that modified the interface between SnO2 and MAPbI3 was found to significantly improve the device performance. The beneficial effects of interface modification on increasing the carrier selectivity to electrons were elucidated, which resulted in a power conversion efficiency of 18.36% for the solar cells under simulated AM1.5 sunlight. The flexible solar cell still retained 75% of its initial efficiency after 500 cycles of bending with a curvature radius of 5 mm. The MAPbI3 solar cells were stable under ambient air conditions (25 °C, 30% relative humidity), and 87% of the initial efficiencies were retained for the unencapsulated devices after 46 days of storage in ambient air.
Introduction
Extensive research efforts on organic–inorganic halide perovskites have been carried out due to not only the incredible power conversion efficiencies achieved to date,1–3 but also the robustness of the low-temperature solution processing of perovskite devices.4–6 The chemical processability further makes the applications of the perovskites in flexible devices feasible;7–11 this provides unique types of thin film solar cells to complement the current industrially dominant Si solar cells. On the other hand, the widely used flexible substrates, such as polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) and poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), cannot survive high temperatures (>150 °C) during the photovoltaic device processing. As a result, all the functional layers, including the electron transport layers and the hole transport layers, inside a perovskite solar cell must be fabricated at relatively low temperatures for flexible solar cells. For this reason, conductive polymers, such as PEDOT:PSS12–15 and PTAA,16,17 which are selective to hole carriers, have been often employed for flexible solar cells. This immediately implies that the flexible perovskite solar cells should be in the p–i–n configuration (an inverted cell). As a result, research on flexible perovskite solar cells with the n–i–p configuration (normal cell) has been by-far lagging behind as the classical electron transport layer of TiO2 deposited at low temperatures suffers from significant hysteresis in the J–V curves;2,3,18 moreover, the low-temperature processable ZnO is not compatible with perovskite solar cells.19 Fortunately, SnO2 has emerged as an effective electron transport layer for perovskite solar cells,20,21 and various low-temperature processes, such as chemical bath deposition,22 atomic layer deposition (ALD),23,24 and spin-coating,25,26 have been developed for the fabrication of a tin oxide (SnO2) layer. These low-temperature processes have inspired researchers to explore the fabrication of flexible perovskite solar cells with the n–i–p configuration.27–30
Although the SnO2 layer offers significant advantages for low-temperature processing as compared to a mesoporous electron transport layer, trap states may still exist at the interface between SnO2 and the perovskite layer. Fullerene and its derivatives, such as C60 and 6,6-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM),28,31–34 have been widely used for interface engineering35,36 to passivate the defects and promote electron extraction. However, it is expected that the hydrophobic surface of these non-polar molecules may affect the conformal contact to the perovskite films. For this reason, the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells on flexible substrates is still relatively low to reach its full potential.
Herein, we have successfully achieved enhancements in the photoelectric conversion efficiency and stability in flexible MAPbI3 solar cells by modifying the SnO2 layer with C60 pyrrolidine tris-acid (CPTA). The solar cell with a planar architecture on an ITO/PEN substrate exhibits the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.36% and long-term stability over 46 days during storage in ambient air. The flexible device further demonstrates excellent durability against mechanical bending (the bending radius of 5 mm) during a period of 500 cycles.
Results
Herein, flexible solar cells of MAPbI3 with a planar architecture were fabricated on ITO-coated PEN substrates. As illustrated in the cross-sectional SEM image of a planar device (Fig. 1a), the CPTA-modified SnO2 (32 nm) and Spiro-OMeTAD (100 nm) serve as the electron transport layer and hole transport layer, respectively. The MAPbI3 film is ∼330 nm thick with conformal contacts to the electron transport layer and the hole transport layer on both sides. The carboxyl groups at the end of the CPTA chain can chemically react and form bonds towards the under-coordinated Sn on the surface of SnO2 (Fig. 1b). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to investigate the interaction between CPTA and SnO2 for the CPTA-modified and bare SnO2 substrates. The presence of the N 1s peak at 399.6 eV and a much higher C 1s peak at 284.5 eV proves the existence of the CPTA layer (Fig. S1†). As shown in Fig. 1c, the photoelectron binding energy for the Sn 3d level of the SnO2 layer with CPTA modification is slightly higher than that for the SnO2 without CPTA; this indicates the presence of additional negative charges around the Sn atoms for the CPTA-modified SnO2.21,37 It confirms the reaction between CPTA and SnO2. As shown in Fig. 1d, the MAPbI3 films entirely cover the SnO2–CPTA substrates. The grain size of MAPbI3 is estimated to be 231 ± 76 nm. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the MAPbI3 films on the CPTA-modified SnO2 substrate is 11.3 nm, which is similar to the RMS roughness (11.8 nm) of the MAPbI3 films directly deposited on the SnO2-covered ITO (Fig. S2†). The XRD patterns of both the MAPbI3 films on bare SnO2 and the CPTA-modified SnO2 substrate (Fig. 1e) show strong peaks at 14.1°, 28.4°, and 31.9°, corresponding to the (110), (220), and (310) crystalline planes of cubic CH3NH3PbI3, which agree well with the diffraction pattern shown in the literature.38–40 The Raman spectrum of the films confirms the existence of CPTA (Fig. S4†) on top of the SnO2 layer. We further found that the CPTA layer could not be removed by a following washing procedure with the mixed solvent of DMF/DMSO (Fig. S5†).

The photovoltaic performance of the flexible MAPbI3 solar cells based on SnO2–CPTA ETL is shown in Fig. 2. After systematic optimization of the concentration of CPTA in the precursor solution (Fig. S6†), a maximum PCE of 18.36% (VOC of 1.083 V, a JSC of 22.39 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.75) was achieved for the champion device when the CPTA concentration was 1 mg mL−1 (Fig. 2a). This represents one of the highest efficiencies reported to date for flexible perovskite solar cells, especially for non-alloyed MAPbI3 solar cells.16,27,41 In contrast, the devices deposited on the bare SnO2 substrates without the CPTA treatment demonstrated a PCE of 15.35%, with a VOC of 1.058 V, a JSC of 21.36 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.68. To demonstrate the unique role of CPTA, another fullerene derivative of PCBM was also tested for the surface modification of SnO2. The solar cell demonstrated a PCE of 11.13%, with a VOC of 1.039 V, a JSC of 16.19 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.66 (Fig. S7†), which was worse than the MAPbI3 solar cells deposited on the bare-SnO2 substrates. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the device performances are provided in Table S1.† We believe that the performance differences mainly arise from the different hydrophilicities of the MAPbI3 films since different functional groups are present inside the CPTA and PCBM molecules (Fig. S8†). Moreover, Fig. S9b† shows the performance of the MAPbI3 solar cells with the CPTA-modified SnO2 ETLs on rigid ITO/glass and flexible ITO/PEN substrates. Similar to that found for the flexible substrate, addition of CPTA between SnO2 and MAPbI3 obviously improved the power conversion efficiencies on rigid substrates. The current density of the flexible devices was lower than that of the rigid devices due to the lower transmittance of the polymer substrate (Fig. S9a†).

(c) The stability of 10 devices with SnO2–CPTA ETL stored without encapsulation in air (25 °C, 30% relative humidity), and (d) the efficiency histogram of 44 flexible devices with SnO2–CPTA as the electron transport layer. 
The stabilized photocurrent of the MAPbI3 devices with CPTA-modified SnO2 ETL was further measured at a maximum power point (Fig. 2b). Under simulated AM1.5 sunlight, the photocurrent density (biased at 0.90 V) was constant at 20.35 mA cm−2 over a period of 280 seconds, which corresponded to a stabilized power conversion efficiency of 18.31%. For the hysteresis test, the flexible devices showed a VOC of 1.097 (1.094) V, a JSC of 21.94 (21.93) mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.73 (0.66), yielding a PCE of 17.76% (15.91%) in the reverse scan (forward scan) direction, respectively, as shown in Fig. S10.† Furthermore, the long-term stability of the MAPbI3 solar cells stored in the dark was evaluated (Fig. 2c). The average efficiency for 10 un-encapsulated MAPbI3 devices on CPTA-modified SnO2 remained 87% of the initial value after the devices were stored for 46 days under ambient conditions (25 °C, 30% relative humidity). For comparison, the efficiency for the best device on bare SnO2 remained at only 80% of its initial efficiency (Fig. S11†). This suggested that the surface modification of SnO2 with CPTA apparently increased the stability of the MAPbI3 solar cells. For the reproducibility tests, 44 individual solar cells on CPTA-modified SnO2 were fabricated, and the PCE distribution histogram is shown in Fig. 2d. It demonstrates a narrow PCE distribution of 16.88 ± 0.87%. In contrast, the MAPbI3 solar cells based on SnO2 without CPTA modification showed a PCE distribution of 11.52 ± 3.10% (15 devices), as shown as the histogram graph in Fig. S12.† The distribution of the PCE became narrower, and the average efficiency increased when CPTA was present in the flexible MAPbI3 solar cells. Detailed comparisons of the photovoltaic parameters show that the VOC and FF (Fig. S6†) are specifically affected due to the presence of the CPTA layer; this has been discussed in the following section.
To understand the differences in the device performance, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were carried out to study the effects of the CPTA modification at the interface between SnO2 and MAPbI3 on carriers. As shown in Fig. 3a, the PL intensity of the MAPbI3 film on SnO2–CPTA is 6-fold weaker than that of MAPbI3 on bare SnO2. For comparison, the PL intensity of MAPbI3 on SnO2-PCBM is only 1.5 fold weaker than that of MAPbI3 on bare SnO2. The much lower PL intensity indicates that the SnO2–CPTA ETL facilitates the extraction of electrons that results in a stronger quenching of the PL. Fig. 3b shows the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of the MAPbI3 films. The PL decay curves are fitted by the two-exponential models. According to the fit (Table S2†), the carrier lifetime of MAPbI3 on bare SnO2 is 214 ns, which decreases to 108 ns for the MAPbI3 film on CPTA-modified SnO2 and 167 ns for MAPbI3 on the SnO2-PCBM electron transport layer.7,43 Clearly, addition of a CPTA layer can more efficiently separate the charges; moreover, we propose that the electron mobility increases when CPTA is added to the electron transport layer. To further verify this, the vertical devices of PEN/ITO/SnO2/Au, PEN/ITO/SnO2–CPTA/Au and PEN/ITO/SnO2-PCBM/Au were fabricated, and their electron conductivities were measured (Fig. 3c). The J–V curves show that the CPTA-modified SnO2 film exhibits higher current density at the same bias than the bare SnO2. Thus, the addition of CPTA can obviously improve the capability of electron extraction; this is consistent with the photoluminescence results (Fig. 3a and b). Fig. S13† shows the open-circuit photo voltage decay (OCVD) curves of the devices based on different ETLs. It is apparent that the planar devices deposited on SnO2–CPTA exhibit slower voltage decay time as compared to the devices based on bare SnO2; this indicates that the devices with the SnO2–CPTA electron transport layer have a lower charge recombination rate and longer carrier lifetime. Fig. 3d shows the energy levels of all the functional layers inside a complete MAPbI3 device.40,42,44,45 The conduction band energy of the CPTA layer (3.9 eV) is higher than that of SnO2 (4.3 eV), which will decrease the energy loss during electron transfer across the SnO2/MAPbI3 interface when CPTA is present. As the electron transfer to the SnO2 film is facilitated, the carrier recombination at the SnO2/MAPbI3 interface should be suppressed. The optimized band alignment, efficient charge extraction and the passivation effects caused by the insertion of CPTA between SnO2 and MAPbI3 should lead to an increase in VOC, JSC and FF. We indeed observed an improved performance for the MAPbI3 solar cells when CPTA was deposited on the SnO2 layer at optimized amounts.

 Fig. 4  Normalized performance parameters of a flexible MAPbI3 solar cell upon increasing the bending cycles with a bending radius of 5 mm. The degradation of the bending resistance results from the decrease in the FF during the bending cycles. 
Furthermore, to verify the mechanical durability of the bendable PSCs, a device using SnO2–CPTA ETL was repeatedly bent to a radius of 5 mm, and the performance effects are shown in Fig. 4. The image of a flexible device is shown in Fig. S15.† The flexible MAPbI3 solar cells displayed a high bending resistance retention rate (≈75% after 500 cycles and still 52% after 1000 cycles). The VOC and JSC did not significantly decrease with the increasing bending cycles, whereas the FF dramatically decreased from 0.74 to 0.58 after 500 bending cycles and further to 0.42 after 1000 bending cycles; this could also be observed in the J–V curves shown in Fig. S14.† In accordance with a previous study,12,27,31 this degradation is most probably due to the brittle nature of the conductive ITO instead of the changes inside MAPbI3.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated an effective route to prepare efficient and stable n–i–p flexible perovskite solar cells by modifying the SnO2 layer with hydrophilic C60 pyrrolidine tris-acid (CPTA). It is demonstrated that the conductivity increase of the electron transport layer and the interface barrier reduction are responsible for the high performance of the PSCs. As a result, the best PSCs have achieved the power conversion efficiency of 18.36% and the steady-state efficiency of 18.31% for 280 seconds. Moreover, the flexible devices based on SnO2–CPTA ETL show excellent ambient stability and mechanical durability. These results provide important insights into the interface design, which may be crucial for the further improvement of the performances of perovskite solar cells.
