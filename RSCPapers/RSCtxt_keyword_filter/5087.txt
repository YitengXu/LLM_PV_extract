, Accepted 21st June 2023First published on 10th July 2023AbstractLead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising candidates for infrared photodetectors (PDs). However, solution-processed PbS CQDs with spectra ranging up to the mid-infrared range are completely absent because long-chain organic ligands capped on large size CQDs provide insufficient steric hindrance to separate the adjacent particles for dispersion in solvents, limiting their application in infrared PDs. Herein we report a strategy that addresses the extension of the response spectra of PbS CQDs by incorporating PbNO2 impurities. This is achieved by photo-carrier transition from the valence band (VB) of PbS CQDs to the unoccupied in-gap states (IGSs) near the conduction band. The device exhibits an obvious response with responsivity of 0.11 A W−1 and a detectivity of 5.38 × 108 Jones under the illumination of 3000 nm light rays at room temperature. Once the temperature decreased to 78 K, the device exhibited a response with a responsivity of 0.03 A W−1 and a detectivity of 3.77 × 108 Jones. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results indicate that these IGSs are formed by using potassium nitrite (KNO2) to remove the oleate ligands and induce oxidation impurities on the CQD surface. Additionally, detailed characterization is carried out to investigate the mechanism of the infrared response of PbS CQDs. We are optimistic that this strategy could provide an alternative avenue toward the use of CQDs in optoelectronic devices with a broad response range.
Introduction
Infrared (IR) semiconductor photodetectors (PDs) have been widely applied in commercial and scientific fields, such as telecommunications,1,2 automatic driving systems,3,4 thermal imaging,5,6 and remote sensing.7,8 One requirement of these PDs is that their response spectra should cover the IR range as broadly as possible.9,10 To date, the spectral range of PDs can be tuned by incorporating impurities into semiconductors.6,7,11 By using impurities to narrow band gaps and induce extrinsic transition, the absorption cutoff edge of indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs), mercury cadmium tellurium (HgCdTe) and silicon (Si) can be extended to the long wavelength IR range.12–16 However, high vacuum facilities and high temperature epitaxial techniques are extremely necessary for device fabrication, resulting in the high cost of these PDs. Hence, it is urgent to develop new techniques for IR materials and PDs.
As one of the representatives of the next generation semiconductor materials, colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have attracted great attention because of their solution processability and band gap tunability.17–20 These features make CQDs quite suitable for the active absorbing layers in PDs,21–24 solar cells,25–28 and light emitting diodes.29–32 Among the reported CQD materials, lead sulfide (PbS) CQDs have made rapid and solid progress in PD applications. Numerous reports have demonstrated that the performance of PbS CQD PDs is nearly equivalent to that of commercial Si and InGaAs PDs.18 Although PbS CQDs exhibit great potential for application in IR PDs, their devices with response spectra up to 3000 nm are completely absent.33 As we know, the number of surface atoms on CQDs would decrease with the particle size increase,34 whereas the number of ligands would not increase. In this case, it is difficult to synthesize large size CQDs no matter whether in nonpolar or polar solvents. The reason is that the long-chain organic ligands capped on large size CQDs provide insufficient steric hindrance to separate the adjacent particles for dispersion in solvents.20 Therefore, it is worth exploiting new methods to broaden the spectral range of PbS CQDs.
Inspired by the state-of-the-art applications of extrinsic Si PDs,13,16 we try to fabricate extrinsic PbS CQD PDs by incorporating external impurities through surface oxidation. The oxidation impurities can be applied for extrinsic PbS CQD PD fabrication because the depth and the density of in-gap states (IGSs) can be controlled.35,36 First, it is well known that slight oxidation leads to the formation of shallow IGSs, which have been shown to boost the power conversion efficiency of PbS CQD solar cells.37,38 In view of this, we attempt to exploit a new ligand to remove the oleate ligands and make CQDs slowly oxidize to generate shallow IGSs. Additionally, once the oleate ligands are completely removed, the surface defects should be oxidized rather than passivated by this ligand.39 Attributed to this improvement, numerous IGSs would be formed because most of the atoms are located on the CQD surface, which would be beneficial for the detection of low energy photons.40 With this consideration in mind, we try to use potassium nitrite (KNO2) to remove the oleate ligands and increase the number of oxidation impurities on the CQD surface. The XPS results show that the concentration of nitrogen ions is low, indicating that KNO2 not only removes the oleate ligands, but also coordinates with Pb ions. Benefiting from these improvements, PbS CQD PDs generate a strong photoconductive response under illumination of 3000 nm light rays. Our results would provide a new avenue for applying CQDs in the future optoelectronic applications.
Results and discussion
The typical intrinsic transition process is presented in Fig. 1(a). Generally, intrinsic semiconductors can detect the incident light when photon energy is larger than their band gaps, while extrinsic semiconductors can detect the incident light when the photon energy is lower than their band gaps, as shown in Fig. 1(b) and (c). Commonly, there are two types of IGSs in extrinsic semiconductors: (I) neutral IGSs; (II) ionized IGSs.41 In the case of Fig. 1(b), the neutral IGSs are occupied donor levels and can release photoexcited electrons to the CB, or they are unoccupied acceptor levels and can capture electrons excited from the VB. In the case of Fig. 1(c), the ionized IGSs are unoccupied donor levels and can capture electrons excited from the VB, or they are occupied acceptor levels and can release photoexcited electrons to the CB. For the as-synthesized PbS CQDs, long-chain organic ligands capped on their surfaces are insulating, hindering their charge transport efficiency.18–20 Thus, the CQD surface should be passivated by short-chain ligands, such as thiols, halides, short-chain amines, metal chalcogenide complexes etc,42–44 as shown in Fig. 1(d). However, PbS CQDs still slowly oxidize in air regardless of the ligands used for surface passivation. The oxidation impurities would introduce acceptors on the CQD surface, which inevitably induce IGSs in its energy band.18–20 Researchers employ PbS CQD photoconductors to investigate the distribution and depths of these IGSs.40 As oxidation impurities are p-type dopants, the majority carriers are holes.45 According to the theory of photoconductivity, the photogenerated electrons can transition from the VBM and are captured by IGSs, then the holes circulate in semiconductors to generate current.40 These results have indicated that IGSs induced by oxidation impurities are easily located near the CBM and they are unoccupied states.36,38,40 Hence, the low energy photons are absorbed and the corresponding photogeneration carriers transition from the VBM to these IGSs. Although oxidation impurities are inevitably introduced, thiol- and halide-treated PbS CQDs exhibit weak extrinsic responses because the CQD surface has been well passivated.40 The density of oxidation impurities is low. As the absorption coefficient is linear with the density of oxidation impurities, the photoconductive response is also weak.11,41 With this consideration in mind, we try to increase the density of oxidation impurities on PbS CQDs by using KNO2 for surface treatment. The NO2− anions would bind with Pb2+ cations and form Pb-complex oxidation in CQDs. The distribution and the depths of IGSs induced by oxidation are shown in Fig. 1(e).

In the present study, we synthesized PbS CQDs from a traditional hot-injection method using oleic acid as the surface ligands. As the insulating oleate ligands hindered carrier transport,5,20 KNO2 was used for surface modification. The microstructure of the as-prepared and KNO2-treated CQDs is shown in Fig. S1, ESI.† The inter-dot spacing of the pristine CQDs was about 2 nm due to the oleate ligands bound to the CQD surface (Fig. S1a, ESI†). After KNO2 treatment, fusion occurs between adjacent particles (Fig. S1b, ESI†). This result was consistent with the results demonstrated in Fig. 2(a). Apparently, the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of KNO2-treated CQDs decreased, indicating that the particle size increased during KNO2 treatment. Besides, the diffraction peaks (111) around 30.17° were not detected in KNO2-treated CQDs, indicating that the fusion could eliminate the (200) facets. As the shape of CQDs was determined by the competition of the surface energies of different facets, we speculated that the surface energy of the (111) facets treated with NO2− ions was lower than that of the self-passivated (001) facets. In order to ensure the formation of PbNO2, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized for further measurements. Fig. 2(b) shows that the signal of nitrogen (N) elements could be detected, indicating that Pb-terminated facets were bound with NO2− anions. In addition to the above results, we should investigate the phase structure of KNO2-treated CQDs. Interestingly, the preserved diffraction peak positions (111), (220), and (222) at around 26.01°, 43.19°, and 53.43° agreed well with the standard diffraction patterns of face-centered cubic PbS (JCPDS 02-0699), indicating that the introduction of NO2− ions did not change the crystal lattice spacing. As the phase structure of KNO2-treated CQDs had no change, we investigated their optical properties using UV-vis spectroscopy and an integrating sphere. Typically, transmission and reflection measurements were carried out to accurately study the absorption of KNO2-treated CQDs. Fig. 2(c) shows that the absorption cutoff wavelength edge of KNO2-treated CQDs extended to near 2000 nm. Consequently, the band gap (Eg) of KNO2-treated CQDs was calculated by using the results of transmission and the equation (αhν)2 = A(hν − Eg),46–48 where α is the absorption coefficient, h is the Planck constant, ν is the frequency of incident light, and Eg is the band gap. Fig. S2b (ESI†) reveals that the Eg of CQDs decreased to 0.64 eV. Interestingly, the same phenomenon appeared when the other sizes of CQDs were treated with KNO2. For example, we synthesized CQDs with 647 nm, 1018 nm and 1504 nm exciton peaks using the same hot injection method. After treating with KNO2, the absorption cutoff wavelength edges of these three CQDs were about 2000 nm, as shown in Fig. S3, ESI.† As the absorption coefficient in the low photon energy region was zero, it was hard to distinguish the optical properties of KNO2-treated CQDs. Hence, photocurrent spectroscopy was employed to investigate the response properties of these CQDs under irradiation of light rays with long wavelength. The results in Fig. 2(d) show that there was an obvious photocurrent generation in KNO2-treated CQDs under 3000 nm light irradiation, whereas the dark current continuously increased at room temperature because the carriers could be excited by the thermal energy (0.026 eV@300 K). In order to reduce the thermal effect on the response performance, the device was loaded in a cryostat with a quartz window and cooled down to 78 K. After the temperature decreased to 78 K, the dark current was suppressed and a periodic light response was obtained, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Based on the above results, we ensured that KNO2-treated PbS CQD devices were photon detectors, rather than thermal detectors. It was obvious that the dark current of the device almost recovered and the signal became smooth when the operational temperature decreased. These results indicated that the dark current was greatly affected by thermal noise. This phenomenon would become serious, especially if the band gap of photoconductors decreased.12,13,15,16 We could extract the photocurrent and dark current from these curves. Then the responsivity can be calculated using the equation R = (Ip − Id)/P, where R is the responsivity, Ip is the photocurrent, Id is the dark current, and P is the light power intensity received by the active area of the device.7 As P was about 28 mW cm−2 and the active area was 4 × 10−6 cm2, the responsivity values of the device operating at room temperature and 78 K were 0.11 A W−1 and 0.03 A W−1, respectively. Subsequently, another important parameter of PDs is detectivity, which could be theoretically calculated using the equation , where q is the elementary charge, A is the active area, R is the responsivity, and Id is the dark current.7 Here, the detectivity of the device operating at room temperature and 78 K was 5.38 × 108 Jones and 3.77 × 108 Jones, respectively. Although KNO2-treated PbS CQDs exhibited high R and D*, their response speed was quite slow. The main reason was that the response speed of photoconductors is determined by the time constant, which is dependent on the times of photogenerated electrons captured and released from IGSs.40 In order to increase the response speed, a blocked impurity band (BIB) architecture can be used for the fabrication of extrinsic PDs. A BIB architecture is constructed using two dopants with different polarities, which could form a space charge region.16 The electric field in the space charge region can make the carrier quickly drift, thus increasing the response speed of PDs.

Since the photo-response of KNO2-treated CQDs could be generated under the irradiation of 3000 nm light rays, it was essential to investigate the chemical components of impurities in CQDs and the depths of energy levels induced by these impurities. In this section, we initially identified the chemical components of impurities. In the above section the results of the N 1s spectrum were described, and the spectra of K 2p, O 1s, Pb 4f, and S 2p were chosen for further characterization, as shown in Fig. 3. According to hard and soft acid and base (HSAB) theory, K cations should prefer to bind with S anions at the S-terminated (001) facets on CQDs. However, there were no K cations shielding on the CQD surface, as shown in Fig. 3(d). This result was different from the results reported by Choi et al.49 Based on our previous results, we concluded that there was a small amount of adsorbed water and oxygen in methanol, which inevitably made CQDs oxidize and hindered the K cations from binding with S anions on (200) facets.39 Hence, the oxidation products of lead sulfite (PbSO3), lead sulfate (PbSO4) and PbNO2 should be considered. The corresponding fitting results are shown in Fig. 3(a)–(c). These results are consistent with the results reported in the previous studies.

Subsequently, we turned to the depths of energy levels induced by PbNO2, PbSO3, and PbSO4 impurities. Transient photocurrent spectroscopy demonstrated by Gerasimos et al.45 was applied to reveal the response mechanism in the current case. Specially, the photogenerated electrons transitioned from the VB to CB, and were captured by IGSs. Hence, the holes could transport in CQDs and generate photoconductivity gain. After removing the light, the captured electrons could be released from IGSs and could return to the VB. Apparently, the IGSs with different depths had various lifetimes, which would affect the response speed of electrons back to the VB. In view of this, the photocurrent decays could be divided into several components, each having its own temperature-dependent time constant. Therefore, the time constants at different temperatures could be extracted to locate the depths of IGSs. In the present study, to ensure that all IGSs in PbS CQDs were filled with photogenerated electrons, incident light with high photon energy should be employed. With this consideration in mind, we use incident light with 1550 nm wavelength to excite electrons directly to the CBM, to then be captured by oxidation impurities. Fig. 4(a) shows that there are three components at room temperature, exhibiting time constants of 60 ms, 300 ms, and 2000 ms. Additionally, the time constants of photocurrent decays at different temperatures were also extracted, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Based on the above discussion, the depths of IGSs were correlated with time constants and temperature, thus the depths (ΔE) could be defined through the equation:45 ΔE = kTlnτvthNcσn, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, τ is the time constant, vth is the thermal velocity of carriers, Nc is the density of states in the CB, and σn is the capture cross-section of the IGSs. As vth is correlated with T1/2, we calculated ΔE by fitting the linear portion from the plotting curve of τT1/2 ∼ 100/T. Fig. 4(b) indicates that the depths of IGSs are 0.09 eV, 0.23 eV and 0.34 eV. The depths of shallower and the deeper IGSs were almost equal to the previous results, indicating that the energy levels induced by PbSO3 and PbSO4 were localized within the band gap of KNO2-treated CQDs. Hence, ΔE with 0.23 eV was the energy depth induced by PbNO2 and this IGS played a key role in the 3000 nm response of KNO2-treated CQDs. Since the depths of IGSs were obtained, we could locate their positions in KNO2-treated CQDs by the combining the results from UV-vis spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Fig. 4(c) presents the full UPS results of KNO2-treated CQDs. From Fig. S6c, d (ESI†), the Fermi level and VB were calculated to be 4.50 eV and 4.74 eV, respectively. Likewise, the CB of KNO2-treated CQDs was determined to be 4.10 eV. Apparently, the Fermi level position was close to the VB, which confirmed the p-type nature of KNO2-treated CQDs. Based on the above discussion, we concluded that these IGSs were located near the CB and all of them were unoccupied levels, as shown in Fig. 4(d). Obviously, this photoresponse model was the same as the model reported by Gerasimos et al.45

(d) The schematic diagram of IGSs of KNO2-treated PbS CQDs with 0.09 eV, 0.23 eV, and 0.34 eV. 
Finally, in order to investigate the stability of KNO2-treated CQDs, the CQD solid was divided into 4 slices and three of them were annealed at 200 °C, 300 °C, and 400 °C, respectively. Fig. 5(a) shows that the cutoff wavelengths of all KNO2-treated CQDs slightly move toward the long wavelength region even as the annealing temperature is increased to 400 °C. Moreover, the corresponding slices were further characterised using XRD. Fig. 5(b) shows that the diffraction peak positions and the FWHM of KNO2-treated CQDs have no obvious changes after annealing at different temperatures, while the intensities of diffraction peaks increase. The CQD sizes could be estimated through the Scherrer equation (D = Kλ/Bcosθ),50,51 where K is the Scherrer constant, λ is the wavelength of the X ray, B is the FWHM, and θ is the angle of Bragg diffraction. As Cu Kα is employed for the measurement, the value of λ is 1.54056 Å; thus the sizes of extrinsic CQDs annealed at 200 °C, 300 °C, and 400 °C are 9.7 nm, 10.6 nm, and 11.4 nm, which are larger than the size of the as-prepared extrinsic CQDs (9.2 nm). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that there were numerous particles formed, whereas the CQD sizes did not grow to the bulk size, as shown in Fig. 5(d). These results were quite different from those of CQDs treated with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT), as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Upon increasing the temperature up to 300 °C, the absorption cutoff wavelength edge of EDT-treated CQDs becomes beyond 2500 nm in Fig. S6a (ESI†). The cutoff of spectral absorption (theoretically 3100 nm) was not observed due to the limitation of the equipment. (Noise would be generated beyond 2500 nm.) The XRD and SEM results in Fig. S6b (ESI†), Fig. S6c–f (ESI†) confirmed that the size of EDT-treated CQDs continuously grew after high temperature annealing. After the annealing temperature reached 300 °C, the size of CQDs increased up to 100 nm. Apparently, this size was larger than the Bohr radius of bulk PbS (18 nm).20 Based on the above analysis, we inferred that KNO2 could decrease the migration coefficient of PbS CQDs; thus it was hard for KNO2-treated PbS CQDs to grow up into bulk materials under high temperature annealing.

Conclusions
In summary, an extrinsic photoconductive response was successfully observed in KNO2-treated PbS CQD solids. KNO2 was used to remove oleate ligands and induce oxidation impurities on the CQD surface. Due to the large surface-to-volume ratio, the number of oxidation impurities was large, which was beneficial for IGS generation within the band gap of extrinsic CQDs. These IGSs could be used to capture the electrons excited from the VB and extend the response range of extrinsic CQDs to 3000 nm. The strategy used in this work indicates that the extrinsic photoconductivity process is powerful for extending the response range and can be extended to other semiconductors.
Methods
Materials
Lead oxide (PbO, 99.9%), 1-octadecene (ODE, >90%), and potassium nitrite (KNO2, 97%) were bought from Aladdin. Oleic acid (OA, 90%) and bis(trimethylsilyl) sulfide (TMS, 98%) were bought from Sigma-Aldrich. Octane (≥95%), acetone (≥99.5%) and methanol (≥99.7%) were bought from Sinopharm reagents. All solvents and materials were used directly without further purification.
PbS CQD synthesis and isolation
PbO (0.9 g, 4 mmol), OA (3 mL, 9.5 mmol), and ODE (20 mL, 62.5 mmol) were loaded in a 100 mL flask and pumped at room temperature for 1 hour. Then, the stock solution was heated to 100 °C under vacuum for 1 hour to obtain a transparent solution. After that, nitrogen gas was charged into the flask using a Schlenk line and the solution temperature was adjusted to 120 °C. Finally, TMS (2 mmol) dissolved in 10 mL degassed ODE was swiftly injected into the Pb precursor under vigorous stirring at 120 °C. Then, the solution was naturally cooled to room temperature. The as-synthesized PbS CQDs were divided into 6 batches and each of them was loaded into a centrifuge tube. 20 mL acetone was added into each centrifuge tube to precipitate out the CQDs. The mixture was centrifuged at 6000 rpm to separate the CQDs from solution. After centrifugation, the upper solution was decanted and 2 mL octane was added to dissolve CQDs. The above purification process was repeated three times until there was no residual OA in the CQD solution. Finally, PbS CQDs were redispersed in octane to form 50 mg mL−1 concentration. The PbS CQDs with different particle sizes were synthesized by adjusting the injection temperature.
Extrinsic PbS CQD PD fabrication
A standard layer-by-layer process was employed for PbS CQD active layer preparation. Specifically, KNO2 was dissolved in methanol to form a stable solution with 10 mg mL−1 concentration. Several drops of PbS CQD solution were dropped onto glass substrates and immediately spun coated at 2500 rpm to form a CQD film. Then, KNO2/methanol solution was dropped onto the CQD film and held for 1 minute for the removal of oleate ligands. After that, the residual solution was removed and fresh KNO2/methanol solution was repeatedly dropped on the CQD film for completely removing the oleate ligands. After ligand exchange, pure methanol was dropped on the CQD film to remove the residual KNO2. Hence, one layer of CQD thin film was prepared. The as-mentioned process was repeated several times until the active layer with desired thickness was achieved. At last, a steel mask was used to cover the surface of the CQD film and Au electrodes were deposited by using thermal evaporation. The thickness, the length and the distance between Au electrodes were 80 nm, 400 μm and 20 μm, respectively.
Material characterization
UV-Vis absorption spectra of PbS CQDs in octane were measured at room temperature using a PerkinElmer spectrophotometer (Lambda 950 with an integrating sphere). The microstructure and size of CQDs was observed with a transmission electron microscope (FEI Tecnai G2 20 UTwin). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were obtained using a Thermo Fisher FTIR6700 with transmission and attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode. XRD patterns were recorded with a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.54 Å. The surface morphology of CQDs was characterized using a scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM, FEI NOVA NanoSEM 450). The chemical components and band structure of CQDs were measured with Thermo Fisher Escalab 250Xi using a Mg Kα source.
Device characterization
The photoconductive response performance was measured by using an Agilent B1500A. The blackbody test was carried out with a commercial blackbody radiation source (HFY-200B), an SR570 current preamplifier and a lock-in amplifier (7270 DSP). For transient photocurrent spectroscopy measurement at different temperatures, the test sample was loaded in a cryostat with a quartz window (Janis Research Co., Inc.) in conjunction with a temperature controller (LakeShore, 325 Temperature Controller). Irradiation was carried out using a light emitting diode with 1550 nm wavelength (Thorlabs M530L2), and the illumination power was calibrated using a silicon photodetector (Newport 818-UV).
