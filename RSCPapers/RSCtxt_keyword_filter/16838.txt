    AbstractSolution processable and thermally stable donor materials 2,5-bis[4-(N,N-diphenylamino)styryl] thiophene (1) and 2,5-bis[4-(N,N-diphenylamino)styryl]-2,2′-bithiophene (2) were synthesized for bulk heterojunction solar cells, which consist of a thiophene, or bithiophene and triphenylamine unit linked with conjugated bonds. The best device performance, optimized at 1:PCBM = 1:3 and 2:PCBM = 1:4, exhibited the maximum open circuit voltages of 0.56 and 0.51 V, short circuit currents of 1.33 and 1.88 mA cm−2, and power conversion efficiencies of 0.23 and 0.34%, respectively, under simulated AM 1.5 solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2.
Introduction
Since the first introduction of organic solar cells (OSCs) based on donor–acceptor heterojunctions by Tang,1 the development of organic solar cells has attracted considerable attention in recent years, due to their easy synthesis, low cost and easy device fabrication. Researchers have focused on improving the power conversion efficiency of the devices using new materials.2,3 In recent years, the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells has been steadily enhanced by the use of various device fabrication methods.4
Small organic molecules based on oligothiophenes and acenes5 have often been used as organic semiconductors due to their good charge transport ability. However, since these materials are known to be oriented perpendicularly on the substrate, OSC device fabrication using these materials results in a reduction in absorption of the incident light as well as charge transport to the electrode. Also, it is difficult to form a uniform film by solution processes with these small organic molecules because they can be easily crystallized in organic solvents.6,7
To overcome these problems, Shirota et al. and Roncali et al. reported 3-dimensional (3-D) star- and propeller-shaped triphenylamine (TPA) derivatives6,7 in which the three phenyl groups are not in the same plane. Furthermore, solution processable triphenylamine derivatives were widely investigated for their electroluminescence, hole transport and OSC potential due to their good charge transport ability and good solubility in organic solvents.6–8 Also, thiophene derivatives have been extensively investigated for their utility as organic thin film transistors (OTFTs),9 organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs)10 and OSCs,11–12 due to their good charge transport ability and good thermal stability.
In this paper, we report that donor materials 1 and 2, consisting of a thiophene and triphenylamine units linked with conjugated bonds, can be successfully utilized to fabricate new bulk heterojunction OSC devices by spin coating of a blended solution of 1 or 2 and [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) (Fig. 1). As a result, the best device performance optimized, at 2:PCBM = 1:4, exhibited an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.51 V, short circuit current (Isc) of 1.88 mA cm−2 and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.34%, under simulated AM 1.5 solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2.

Results and discussion

1 and 2 were synthesized by a Heck coupling reaction between biphenyl-(4-vinylphenyl)amine (3)13 and 2,5-dibromothiophene or 5,5′-dibromo-2,2′-bithiophene, respectively (Scheme 1).

Fig. 2 and ESI, Fig. S1† show the UV and PL spectra of 1 and 2 in CH2Cl2, neat films, and the blended film of 1 and 2:PCBM = 1:1. The absorption spectra of 1 and 2 in CH2Cl2 show three main absorption bands, with λmax at 281, 408, 441 nm, and 271, 386, 461 nm, in which peaks at 281 and 271 nm originate from the triphenylamine unit, and peaks at 441 and 461 nm originate from the olighthiophene core, respectively. The PL spectra of 1 and 2 in CH2Cl2 show an emission peak at 538 nm. The absorption spectra of 1 and 2 in solid films show absorption bands with λmax at 282, 410, 442 nm, and 272, 386, 461 nm, respectively. The PL spectra of 1 and 2 in solid films show an emission peak at 565 nm. In solid films, the PL spectra of 1 and 2 were red-shifted by about 27 nm in comparison with the CH2Cl2 solution, due to the self-aggregation and intermolecular interaction9b of 1 and 2 (Fig. 2a, ESI Fig. S1†, and Table 1). The PL spectra of the 1 and 2:PCBM = 1:1 blended films indicate that the PL spectra of 1 and 2 were significantly quenched by PCBM (Fig. 2b). That means that an intermolecular photoinduced charge transfer (PICT) and energy transfer process from the excited state of 1 and 2 to PCBM occurred.8,14 In this blended film of 1 or 2/PCBM, 1 and 2 were used as the electron donor material, and PCBM as the electron acceptor material. This photoinduced charge transfer process is similar to the case of a conducting conjugated polymer and fullerene blend system.14

The electrochemical properties of 1 and 2 were measured by cyclic voltammetry in CH2Cl2. This electrochemical experiment was referenced with respect to Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode at room temperature and then calibrated to a standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) using ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+). Dichloromethane solutions for cyclic voltammetry contained a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum wire counter-electrode, and 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) as a supporting electrolyte. The cyclic voltammograms of 1 and 2 show a less reversible oxidation process when compared to that associated with the generation of the cation radical. The oxidation potential energies of 1 and 2 are observed at E1/2 = 0.68 and 0.70 V vs. SHE, respectively (Fig. 3a and b). The HOMO energy levels of 1 (−5.00 eV) and 2 (−5.01 eV) are calculated from E1/2 after correction of the vacuum energy level (4.49 eV) (Table 1). The oxidation potential energy of 2 is slightly higher than that of 1 due to the increased thiophene linker and longer conjugation length. The LUMO energy levels of 1 (−2.54 eV) and 2 (−2.47 eV) are calculated from the cross-sectional wavelength between the absorption and emission spectra (Table 1).

The thermal stability of 1 and 2 were investigated using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The thermal decomposition temperatures (Td) were 412 °C for 1 and 431 °C for 2 (ESI, Fig. S4 and S5†). Both 1 and 2 exhibited high thermal stability. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data showed that the glass transition temperatures (Tg) were 116 °C for 1 and 180 °C for 2 (Fig. S6 and S7†).
Devices based on organic layers were fabricated by spin coating and evaporation. A 30 nm thick film of PEDOT:PSS was used as a hole injection layer. A 45 nm thick film of active layers was prepared by spin coating an o-dichlorobenzene solution of donor (1 or 2) and acceptor (PCBM) at different weight ratios (pure, 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, w/w) on the PEDOT:PSS layer. Next, a 5 nm thick Bphen or BCP layer, as an exciton blocking layer (EBL), was evaporated. Finally, a 100 nm thick aluminium layer was evaporated onto the Bphen layer. The current–voltage (I–V) measurements for the devices were performed on a Keithley 237 instrument. The device performances were characterized under uniform illumination (AM 1.5 G illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2) using a solar simulator. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated using the standard Si solar cell as a reference.
In order to investigate the device performances of 1 and 2, three types of device were fabricated. The first one was the single component device based on pure 1 and 2 as donor; the second was the bilayer heterojunction device based on 1 or 2 as donor and C60 as acceptor; the third was the bulk heterojunction device based on 1 or 2 as donor and PCBM as acceptor. Fig. 4 and ESI, Fig. S3 and S8† show the I–V curves of single component, bilayer, and bulk heterojunction devices based on 1 and 2, respectively. Single component devices based on pure 1 and 2 exhibit very low power conversion efficiency values, open circuit voltages (0.018, 0.007 V) and short circuit currents in comparison with bulk heterojunction devices using 1 or 2/PCBM, due to the inefficient photoinduced charge transfer and charge separation.8,14 Also, bilayer devices of 1 and 2/C60 (1 or 2: 10 nm, C60: 35 nm) show low power conversion efficiencies of 0.004 and 0.007%, due to inefficient charge separation (ESI, Fig. S8†). However, the power conversion efficiency of bulk heterojunction devices using 1 or 2:PCBM = 1:1 is significantly higher than those of the single component devices based on pure donors 1 and 2, and bilayer devices based on 1 and 2/C60, due to efficient photoinduced charge transfer and charge separation. Therefore, compared with single component devices, bilayer devices and bulk heterojunction devices are much more efficient.8 It is also evident that bulk heterojunction devices are much more efficient than bilayer devices due to efficient charge separation and charge transport.

In order to achieve optimum device performance, bulk heterojunction devices using 1 or 2/PCBM were fabricated, and their weight ratios were varied from 1:1 to 1:4. Fig. 4 and Table 2 show the device performances of bulk heterojunction devices based on 1 or 2 and PCBM at different ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4). In the case of both 1 and 2, device data exhibited a similar device performance due to their similar molecular structures. At low PCBM concentrations, in the case of 1 or 2:PCBM = 1:1, the power conversion efficiencies of the devices are 0.08 and 0.11%. Similarly, in the case of 1 or 2:PCBM = 1:2, the power conversion efficiencies of the devices are the same, at 0.07%. As the PCBM concentration increases, on the other hand, in the case of 1 or 2:PCBM = 1:3, the power conversion efficiencies of the devices are increased ca. 2 times, to 0.23 and 0.15%. In the case of 1 or 2:PCBM = 1:4, the power conversion efficiencies of the devices are 0.18 and 0.34% (Table 2). As a result, in the case of both 1 and 2, by increasing the PCBM concentration from 1:1 to 1:4, the power conversion efficiency of the devices are similarly increased ca. 2–3 times due to efficient photoinduced charge transfer and charge separation via homogeneous film morphology. The overall device data based on 1 or 2 are summarized in Table 2.

In order to examine the dependence of the performance on the film thickness, we fabricated bulk heterojunction devices with different thicknesses of the active layer. Fig. 5 shows the I–V curves of bulk heterojunction devices with different active layer thicknesses. At 20 nm thickness of 1 and 2, the power conversion efficiencies of the devices are 0.08 and 0.07%. At 40 nm thickness of 1 and 2, the power conversion efficiencies of the devices are slightly increased to 0.10 and 0.13%. The 100 nm thick layers of 1 and 2 show maximum power conversion efficiencies of 0.14 and 0.15%. On the other hand, as the thickness of 1 and 2 was increased further to 200 nm, the devices exhibited slightly reduced power conversion efficiencies of 0.10 and 0.09%. The change in the thickness of 1 and 2 from 20 to 100 nm in the active layer increased the power conversion efficiencies from 0.08 and 0.07% to 0.14 and 0.15%, respectively. The overall device data based on 1 or 2 are summarized in Table 3.

We assume that the poor device performance of 1 or 2:PCBM = 1:1 devices is due to poor morphology, heterogeneous film, and aggregate formation.15 In order to explain the device performance difference using the 1 or 2/PCBM blend system, we investigated the morphology of these 1 or 2/PCBM blended films by atomic force microscopy (AFM).15 The AFM images of the blended films of 1 or 2/PCBM are shown in Fig. 6. The morphology of 1 or 2:PCBM = 1:1 blended films exhibits the formation of many aggregates, and heterogeneous films (Fig. 6a and c), which is likely due to the donor–donor interaction at relatively high concentration of donors 1 and 2. The poor open circuit voltages, short circuit currents, and power conversion efficiencies of 1 or 2:PCBM = 1:1 are most likely due to the poor morphology resulting from aggregation of 1 or 2/PCBM. On the other hand, the morphologies of 1:PCBM = 1:3 and 2:PCBM = 1:4 blended films exhibit continuous, homogeneous and good film morphology in comparison with 1 or 2:PCBM = 1:1 blend solid films (Fig. 6b and d). Thus, at this ratio, they exhibited maximum power conversion efficiency. Therefore, at a higher concentration of PCBM, the power conversion efficiency of the devices increases ca. 2–3 times in comparison with low concentrations of PCBM, due to good, continuous, and homogeneous morphology.8,15

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have developed solution processable and thermally stable new donor materials 1 and 2, which consist of thiophene and triphenylamine units linked with conjugated bonds. The bulk heterojunction devices were fabricated by spin coating the blended solution of 1 or 2 and PCBM at different weight ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4, w/w). Compared with single component devices and bilayer devices, the bulk heterojunction devices using 1 or 2/PCBM were more efficient. The best device performance is optimized at 2:PCBM = 1:4; the maximum open circuit voltage, short circuit current, and power conversion efficiency value of the device exhibited 0.51 V, 1.88 mA cm−2, and 0.34%, respectively, under simulated AM 1.5 solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2. 1 and 2, based on triphenylamine and thiophene derivatives, can be useful as donor materials.
