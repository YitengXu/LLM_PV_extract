    , Accepted 6th December 2019First published on 11th December 2019AbstractCompared with the three-dimensional (3D) hybrid perovskite materials, the Ruddlesden–Popper layered two-dimensional (2D) perovskites are much more stable due to the introduction of large hydrophobic cations. And they have many important applications in optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate that the performance of the quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskite photodetectors (PDs) can be improved by incorporating a layer of SiO2 coated AuAg-alloyed nanoprisms (AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2). Incorporation of AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 can increase the external quantum efficiency (EQE) values of the device over a broadband wavelength range. Under 532 nm laser illumination at an incident power density of 1 × 10−4 mW cm−2, the quasi-2D perovskite-based PD with AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 exhibits a high EQE of 1670% at a low driving voltage of −0.3 V. Responsivity (R) and detectivity (D*) reach 7.15 A W−1 and 3.2 × 1013 Jones, increased by 51.2% and 68.4% with respect to the control PD. Studies show that AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 incorporation can help to form high quality crystalline quasi-2D perovskite films, increase light absorption in the active layer, accelerate exciton dissociation at the interface and facilitate charge transport in the devices. These synergistic effects contribute to the improvement of EQE, R, D* and stability of the device after AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 doping. This work contributes to the fabrication of low-cost and high-performance PDs.
Introduction
Photodetectors (PDs), which can convert light into electrical signals, can be used in imaging, communication, chemical monitoring, and biomedical sensing fields.1–4 PDs based on traditional inorganic semiconductor materials have been studied extensively in the past and some have already been used commercially.5–7 However, these PDs rely on expensive, time-consuming and high-temperature fabrication processes. Recently, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have drawn great research interest due to their excellent optoelectrical properties and low production costs. And they have already shown great potential in optoelectronic devices such as photovoltaics, light emitting diodes, PDs, and lasers.8–11 Compared with three-dimensional (3D) hybrid perovskites, the Ruddlesden–Popper layered two-dimensional (2D) perovskite materials have shown much better thermal and moisture stabilities due to the introduction of large alkyl ammonium cations that can protect the “perovskite layer”.12–17 The formula of the layered 2D perovskites can be expressed as (RNH3)2(A)n−1BX3n+1, where R is a large alkyl ammonium cation, A is an organic cation (CH3NH3+, CH3(NH2)2+) or Cs+, B is a metal cation and X is a halide. For the application of PDs, the large alkyl ammonium cation can suppress the dark currents, which is beneficial to the detection of weak signals. In addition, as a member of the 2D layered material family, like graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides and black phosphorus, the 2D layered perovskites also exhibit some unique electrical, optical, and mechanical properties that cannot be observed in their 3D bulk counterparts due to the dimensionality confinement effect.16,18–22 Moreover, the anisotropy of the 2D perovskite structure allows the detection of polarized light.23
2D perovskite-based PDs have already been reported recently.23–34 For example, in 2015, Ahmad et al. fabricated 2D perovskite PDs based on (C6H9C2H4NH3)2PbI4 and achieved an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 10% when TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs) were integrated into the perovskite layers.35 Later, in 2016, Zhou et al. reported PDs based on 2D (C4H9NH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1 perovskites with a lateral two-electrode structure. Under 3.0 mW cm−2 white light illumination and a bias voltage of 30 V, the responsivity (R) of the fabricated 2D perovskite PDs is 12.78 mA W−1 for the n = 3 device.25 Subsequent research also indicated that the PDs based on single crystalline 2D perovskites can sense light with very high responsivity.24,27,32 All this progress demonstrates the potential of quasi-2D perovskites for fabricating high-performance PDs.
The research of 2D perovskite PDs is still in its ascendance; especially, the hybridization of 2D perovskites and other structures is relatively rare. Plasmonic NPs have been widely incorporated in solar cells to increase power conversion efficiency by improving the optical and electrical properties.36–41 Similar effects have also been confirmed in PDs42,43 made of traditional semiconductors, e.g., Si,44 InAs,45 CdSe,46 and ZnO,47,48 as well as some emerging 2D semiconductors like graphene.49 Very recently, Sun et al. demonstrated that the integration of Au NPs into graphene/CH3NH3PbI3 hybrid PDs can induce a higher photo-responsivity and faster photoresponse speed compared with pristine devices.50 In these plasmonic NP enhanced PDs, light absorption in the active layers was increased and thus higher photocurrents were produced due to the excitation of plasmonic resonances.46,48–51 Some beneficial electrical effects with the help of plasmonic NPs including improved exciton dissociation,52 facilitated charge transport,53 and hot carrier injection54 have also been accepted as contributions to the ultimate photocurrent performances of the device. It is expected that the incorporation of plasmonic NPs in 2D perovskite PDs can also produce much improved performances.
In this work, we incorporate plasmonic NPs of SiO2 coated AuAg-alloyed nanoprisms (AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2) into the quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskite PDs to improve the performances. Meanwhile, it is found that the crystallinity of polycrystalline quasi-2D perovskite film can be improved significantly by incorporating AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2, different from previous reports that similar crystallinity was observed after the introduction of NPs in 3D perovskite PDs.55 The optimal incorporation of AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 can improve the EQE values over a broadband wavelength range. Under 532 nm illumination with an incident power density of 1 × 10−4 mW cm−2, at a low driving voltage of −0.3 V, the optimal plasmonic PD exhibits a R of 7.15 A W−1 and detectivity (D*) of 3.2 × 1013 Jones, increased by 51.2%, and 68.4%, respectively, with respect to the control PD. Measurements show that the optimal incorporation of AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 greatly increases the photocurrent while keeping the dark current almost constant, thus increasing R and D* of the devices. Our systematic study shows that the improved PD performance is attributed to the improvement in the crystallinity of the quasi-2D perovskite film, as well as improvement in the optical and electrical properties of the devices after plasmonic NP incorporation.
Fabrication and characterization methods
Synthesis of AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2
The AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 were obtained by the chemical synthesis method.36 The detailed synthesis procedure can be found in the supporting information. In order to spin coat AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 on the poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) layer without damaging the underlying PEDOT:PSS layer, we changed the solvent to ethanol by centrifuging twice (7000 rpm, 20 min).

Fabrication of perovskite photodetectors. 
The structure of the quasi-2D perovskite based PDs incorporated with a plasmonic NP layer is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2/(PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (PEA, C6H5(CH2)2NH3+)/PC61BM/poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N dimenthylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctyfluorene)] (PFN)/Ag, as shown in Fig. 1(a), where PEDOT:PSS serves as the hole transporting layer, (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 quasi-2D perovskite is the active layer, PC61BM is the electron transporting layer and PFN is added to reduce the dark current. In order to compare the device performance before and after AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 doping, a control device without AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 at the interface was also fabricated with all other layers unchanged. Details for fabricating the devices are presented in the supporting information. Thicknesses of the PEDOT:PSS, (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10, PC61BM and PFN layers were measured to be 30 nm, 60 nm, 25 nm and 15 nm, respectively. The corresponding energy band diagram of the control device is given in Fig. 1(b). On the basis of the control devices, the proposed plasmonic NP modified devices were fabricated via spin-coating the synthesized AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 solution at different concentrations on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s and then annealing the sample at 120 °C for 10 min. For analyzing the carrier mobility property in the presence of metallic NPs, single hole devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10/MoO3/Ag and single electron devices with a structure of ITO/PC61BM/(PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10/PC61BM/PFN/Ag with or without AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 were also fabricated. The active area of each fabricated quasi-2D perovskite PD device was about 0.04 cm2, determined by the overlap of the ITO anode and Ag cathode.

Characterization
Thicknesses of the films were measured by a stylus profiler (Dektak XT, Bruker). The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the devices in the dark and under illumination were measured using a programmable source meter (Keithley 2400) and a semiconductor analyzer (Agilent B1500). The light source was supplied by a collimated LED (505 nm, Thorlabs), a laser (532 nm, Changchun New Industries Optoelectronics Tech. Co., Ltd) and a xenon lamp (ZOLIX GLORIA-X150A) combined with a monochromator (ZOLIX 0mni-λ 3005) with the light intensities characterized by a power meter (Ophir NOVA II). Surface morphologies of the (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 quasi-2D perovskite films were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM, SPA-3000HV). Crystallinity of the quasi-2D perovskite films was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of the PDs was performed using an electrochemical workstation (CHI660D) in the dark under a bias voltage of 0.8 V with an alternative signal of 5 mV in the range from 1 Hz to 2 × 106 Hz. Morphologies of AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 were examined by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM JEM 2010) and the absorption spectra of AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 were measured by a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 2600). Absorption spectra were measured using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 2600). The steady state PL spectra were recorded using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Edinburgh Instruments, FLS-980) and the transient responses were obtained by a pulsed 505 nm LED controlled by a signal generator and recorded by an Agilent B2900A. All measurements were performed in air without encapsulation.
Based on the I–V measurement results, R, EQE, and D* of the PDs can be derived by the following equations. (1) (2) (3)

Results and discussion
From Fig. 2(a), it can be observed that the device doped with 0.7 mM mL−1 AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 exhibits much lower dark currents than the other two doped devices. Under 505 nm LED illumination with an intensity of 1.273 mW cm−2, photocurrent increases greatly for the device doped with 0.7 mM mL−1 AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2, as shown in Fig. 2(b). Both from the dark current and photocurrent curves, it can be concluded that the device with 0.7 mM mL−1 AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 performs best among the doped devices (optimal device), showing a light on/off ratio of ∼103 at −1 V. AFM, XRD and EIS characterizations (Fig. S1–S3, ESI†) also show that the (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 quasi-2D perovskite film doped with 0.7 mM mL−1 AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 has the smoothest surface, best crystallinity and smallest recombination loss among the three doped devices. In the following, we will focus on the performance of the control and the optimal devices.

Fig. 3(a) and (b) plot the photo-switching characteristics of the control and optimal PDs under a periodic on–off illumination (wavelength = 505 nm, intensity = 0.673 mW cm−2) at the bias voltage of −0.3 V. Both the control and optimal devices exhibit stable performance with photocurrents following the change of light signals. Photocurrents of the optimal device are obviously higher than those of the control device, in accordance with the results shown in Fig. 2(b). Fig. 3(c) shows the spectral photoresponse of the control and optimal devices measured at −0.3 V. The EQEs at different wavelengths were measured with a Xe lamp equipped with a monochromator as the light source and the light intensities at different wavelengths are given in Fig. S4 (ESI†). It can be observed that both the control and optimal devices exhibit a broadband detection ability from 300 nm to 750 nm. Moreover, EQE values of the optimal device are obviously larger than those of the control device over a broadband wavelength range. At the peak of 500 nm with an incident power density of 0.585 mW cm−2, EQE of the optimal device reaches 107.8%, while that of the control device is below unity. The corresponding R and D* are also shown in Fig. 3(c) and (d). It was found that both R and D* of the optimal device are larger than those of the control device.

(c and d) The spectral photoresponse (EQE, R and D*) of the control and optimal devices measured at −0.3 V. 
Next, the photocurrents of the control and optimal devices were measured as a function of light density at the bias voltage of −0.3 V under 532 nm laser illumination. As can be seen in Fig. 4(a) and (b), photocurrents increase almost linearly with the increase of the light intensity in the range of 10−4 to 4.8 × 102 mW cm−2 both for the control and optimal devices. Accordingly, the linear dynamic range (LDR) is defined by (4)where Psat and Plow are the highest and lowest detectable illumination power densities of the linear range. Here, for both the control and the optimal device, their LDR is determined to be 134 dB. Based on the measured photocurrent shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b), EQE, R and D* were derived, as shown in Fig. 4(c)–(e). It was observed that EQE, R and D* increase when the light intensity decreases, consistent with the results reported in the literature.56–58 EQE, R and D* of the optimal device reach 1670%, 7.15 A W−1 and 3.2 × 1013 Jones, respectively, at −0.3 V under 532 nm laser illumination at Pin = 10−4 mW cm−2, increasing by 51.3%, 51.2% and 68.4%, respectively, with respect to those of the control device.

In order to examine the effect of AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 incorporation on the performance of the PDs, a series of experiments and simulations were carried out. The effect on the crystallinity of the quasi-2D perovskite film was investigated by using XRD. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the XRD patterns of the control and the AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 incorporated quasi-2D perovskite films are quite different from each other, implying that AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 incorporation has an apparent impact on the crystallinity of the quasi-2D perovskite film. Intensities of the diffraction peaks increase significantly after AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 doping, which suggests that 0.7 mM mL−1 AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 incorporation at the interface can promote high crystallinity of the quasi-2D perovskite film. Our results shown here are quite different from the observations for 3D perovskite films, which show similar crystallinity with the presence of metal NPs.55 This demonstrates that AuAgNPrisms@SiO2 can serve as an inducer for forming a high quality crystalline quasi-2D perovskite film. Such an improvement of the film crystallinity can yield a more stable dark current, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), favoring the PD performance.

The EIS of the control and optimal PDs was characterized with their Nyquist spectra, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The semicircle in the low-frequency region correlates with the charge recombination resistance. Fitting of the plots gives the charge recombination resistance of the optimal device of 10000 Ω, whereas that for the control device is only 8300 Ω. The larger charge recombination resistance after doping 0.7 mM mL−1 AuAgNPrisms@SiO2 demonstrates that the charge recombination loss is reduced by the introduction of AuAgNPrisms@SiO2, which is ascribed to the improvement of crystallinity of the quasi-2D perovskite film.
The influence of AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 incorporation on the light absorption was studied by using the UV-vis spectra of multilayer films without and with AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 doping at the interface. Fig. 6(a) shows the absorption spectra of the fabricated AuAg-NPrisms and AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 in ethanol solution. It is shown that both AuAg-NPrisms and AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 show a wide absorption ability, with their resonant peak locating at 590 and 596 nm, respectively. From the TEM image of AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 shown in Fig. 6(b), we can see that the obtained metallic NPs are triangular prisms with an average side length of 46 nm. The bright edges in the image are the thin SiO2 shell, which is measured to be 3 nm. Fig. 6(c) displays the absorption spectra of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS (multilayer 1) and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (multilayer 2) multilayer films without and with AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 incorporation at the interface. Without the quasi-2D perovskite active layer, the absorption of the two kinds of ITO/PEDOT:PSS multilayer films is almost zero across the investigated wavelength range. After coating the quasi-2D perovskite layer, absorption of the two kinds of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 multilayer films increases significantly. Therefore, absorption of multilayer 2 mainly comes from the (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 quasi-2D perovskite film. It was also observed that introducing AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 at the interface can increase the absorption efficiencies of the multilayer 2 films from 420 nm to 600 nm. From the absorption spectra, it was concluded that light absorption mainly takes place in the quasi-2D perovskite active layer and the introduced AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 can improve the light capture ability of the quasi-2D perovskite layer. We also simulated the absorption of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 multilayer films with the incorporation of AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2. The detailed simulation method can be found in the supporting information. Fig. 6(d) shows the electric field distribution near AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 in contact with the qausi-2D perovskite layer at 565 nm. It reflects that the intensities of the electric field surrounding AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 become greatly enhanced, which benefits light absorption in the active layer.

The time-resolved and steady-state PL spectra of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10/PC61BM (multilayer 3) multilayer films without and with 0.7 mM mL−1 AuAgNPrisms@SiO2 were measured to study the effect of AuAgNPrisms@SiO2 incorporation on the exciton behaviors. From Fig. 7(a), we can clearly see that the PL lifetime of the AuAgNPrisms@SiO2 modified film is shorter with respect to the control film. The shorter PL lifetime with the presence of AuAgNPrisms@SiO2 is an indicator of improved emission due to the increase in the radiative recombination rate, which is attributed to the excitation of localized SPPs, as frequently witnessed in organic light emitting diodes.59,60 The accelerated radiative recombination can lead to an increase in PL intensity, as reported for organic light emitting diodes.60 Moreover, as derived from Fig. 6(a), the absorption efficiencies of the AuAgNPrisms@SiO2 incorporated films are higher than those of the control films, so the exciton generation rates in the active layer are higher accordingly. From these two points, the PL intensities of the AuAgNPrisms@SiO2 incorporated films should be higher than those of the control films. However, as displayed in Fig. 7(b), the PL intensities of the AuAgNPrisms@SiO2 modified multilayer 3 are much lower than that of the control. This phenomenon was also observed by Saliba et al. in ref. 61. Their systematic study explains that the presence of metallic NPs results in faster radiative emission but also partially guides the reemitted light into the perovskite film. The first mechanism increases the external PL, but the second mechanism reduces the external PL through increasing the reabsorption of emitted light within the perovskite film. They claimed that the whole process ultimately enhances the photon recycling within the quasi-2D perovskite film. Here, the photon recycling could be one possible reason for the decrease of PL of multilayer 3 with the incorporation of plasmonic particles.

(b) The steady-state PL spectra of the multilayer 3 and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 (multilayer 2) multilayer films without and with 0.7 mM mL−1 AuAgNPrisms@SiO2. 
Besides the photon recycling scheme, the increase in exciton dissociation should be considered as another factor resulting in the decrease of PL. To illustrate this issue, the PL spectra of multilayer 2 without and with 0.7 mM mL−1 AuAgNPrisms@SiO2 were also measured, as shown in Fig. 7(b). On one hand, it is observed that after spin-coating PC61BM, the PL intensities decrease dramatically, reflecting the strong exciton dissociation taking place at the (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10/PC61BM interface. On the other hand, we see that the decrease of the PL intensities of multilayer 3 is much larger than the decrease of intensities of multilayer 2 after the incorporation of AuAgNPrisms@SiO2. The observed more distinct degradation of PL might be related to the facilitated exciton dissociation due to AuAgNPrisms@SiO2. In other words, the incorporated AuAgNPrisms@SiO2 can assist the electron transfer from the qausi-2D perovskite layer to the PC61BM layer, thus fewer excitons are recombined through radiation.
In Fig. 7(b), one can also observe that the PL peak of multilayer 3 blue-shifts with respect to that of multilayer 2 without doping. As the PL peak of multilayer 2 is located at 730 nm and that of PC61BM is located at about 600 nm,62 after spin-coating the PC61BM layer on multilayer 2, the PL peak will blue-shift to a shorter wavelength. In contrast, after the incorporation of AuAgNPrisms@SiO2, the PL peak of multilayer 3 does not shift with respect to that of multilayer 2. Characterization shows that the PL peak of (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 is located at 730 nm (Fig. S6, ESI†). As discussed above, the (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10/PC61BM interface favors the radiative emission taking place at a shorter wavelength. The phenomenon of the non-shift of the PL peak implies that the incorporation of AuAgNPrisms@SiO2 enables the radiative emission to happen within the bulk (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 film even though the PC61BM layer is adjacent. Such a regulation of the regions of radiative emission should be accompanied with the regulation of the regions of exciton generation. This phenomenon coincides with the field enhancement due to the excitation of localized SPPs by AuAgNPrisms@SiO2, as indicated in Fig. 6(d). The presence of AuAgNPrisms@SiO2 causes the absorption in the (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10 film to become stronger in the region close to the PEDOT:PSS layer.
In addition, we fabricated the single hole and single electron devices with architectures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/(PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10/MoO3/Ag and ITO/PC61BM/(PEA)2(MA)2Pb3I10/PC61BM/PFN/Ag, where the MoO3 layer and the PC61BM layer adjacent to ITO play the roles of blocking electrons and holes, respectively. The devices were fabricated with or without 0.7 mM mL−1 AuAgNPrisms@SiO2. J1/2–V curves of single hole and single electron devices are shown in Fig. 8. One can see that with respect to the control device, the single hole (or electron) device doped with AuAgNPrisms@SiO2 shows better J–V characteristics, manifesting that both the hole and electron mobilities increased. Hole and electron mobilities calculated using the Mott-Gurney law63,64 (details can be found in the supporting information) increased from 3.66 × 10−4 to 7.22 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.66 × 10−5 to 8.20 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 with the addition of 0.7 mM mL−1 AuAgNPrisms@SiO2, with a 97.3% enhancement in hole mobility and 394.0% enhancement in electron mobility. The improvement in carrier mobilities leads to faster charge transport in the devices, acting as a reason for the increase of photocurrent after doping 0.7 mM mL−1 AuAgNPrisms@SiO2.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 incorporated quasi-2D perovskite-based PDs with a high EQE of 1670% and LDR of 134 dB at a low driving voltage of −0.3 V. R and D* reach 7.15 A W−1 and 3.2 × 1013 Jones under 532 nm laser illumination with Pin = 10−4 mW cm−2, increasing by 51.2% and 68.4% with respect to those of the control PD. By incorporating AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 at the interface between the hole transporting layer and the quasi-2D perovskite active layer, crystallinity of the quasi-2D perovskite film greatly improved. Meanwhile, EQE, R and D* of the devices increased over the wavelength range from 300 nm to 750 nm. The improvement is attributed to the absorption enhancement in the quasi-2D perovskite layer, photon recycling, faster exciton dissociation and charge transport in the device due to the incorporated AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2. In addition, the dark current stability is improved after AuAg-NPrisms@SiO2 incorporation. This work paves a way to improve the performance of thin film PDs.
