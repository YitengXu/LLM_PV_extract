    , Accepted 4th May 2016First published on 5th May 2016AbstractA new solution processed A–π–D–π–A type small molecule denoted as DCATT-L has been synthesized as a donor for bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. Compared with its isomer DCATT, reported in our previous work, DCATT-L possesses the same building blocks, but different π-bridge configurations and hence different backbone configurations. Changing the π-bridge with delicate designs, the absorption coefficient is increased significantly and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level is decreased by 0.1 eV. The excellent optical and electrical properties of DCATT-L guarantee the enhancement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) to 7.72%, compared with that of DCATT (5.20%), with simultaneously increasing open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current density and fill factor.
Introduction
Solution-processable small molecules for organic solar cells (SMOSCs) have been investigated intensively in recent years, due to their prominent advantages, that is, (1) less batch to batch variation of performance due to their uniform and defined molecular structures; (2) easily tunable absorptions and energy levels resulting from a dedicated chemical structure design; (3) generally higher intrinsic mobility and open circuit voltage (VOC).1–10 These potential reasons and recent significant developments indicate that SMOSCs could play an important role in bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells. Until now, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼10% has been achieved for SMOSCs,11–14 which is comparable to those of polymer-based OSCs.15–17 Although outstanding results have been achieved, further efforts for higher efficiency SMOSCs would be required before their industrialization. And the first fundamental issue is to design new small molecules as the donor materials with some satisfactory advantages, such as, excellent film formation ability, efficient absorption, matched energy levels with the acceptors, and so forth. Until now, different kinds of defined backbone architectures of small molecules have been developed, which can be classified into donor–acceptor (D–A) type,18,19 acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)20,21 type, donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) type,22etc. Among them, the acceptor–π–donor–π–acceptor (A–π–D–π–A) type frame is one of the most promising molecular design strategies to broaden absorption, improve hole mobility, and obtain suitable energy levels.23–25 Referring to the A–π–D–π–A system molecules, most of the research has been focused on the structural optimization of donors and acceptors. In the search for appropriate donor molecules, various frameworks have shown high OSC performance, including benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT),26–28 dithienosilole (DTS)29,30 and porphyrine.31–33 Typically, BDT has been receiving extensive research, and various modifications were applied on the 4 and 8 positions of the BDT unit substituted with alkyl, alkyloxyl, or alkylthiophene. For end-capped acceptors, indenedione (ID), 3-ethylrhodanine (RH), alkyl cyanoacetate (ACA) and their respective derivatives have been widely applied in the molecular system. Except for the donor and ending acceptor units, in fact, the π-conjugation bridging group also plays a crucial role in the material's properties, mainly contributed by both the side chains and the configuration of the π-bridging backbone.34,35 It is clear to say that research on the location of alkyl side chains has received much attention, while the effort has been seldom focused on the backbone configuration of the conjugated spacer. Li et al.36 reported a pair of A–π–D–π–A type molecules for application as donor materials in OSC devices, in which BDT and RH were selected as the donor and terminal acceptor, while thiophene or bithiophene was introduced as the π-bridge linking group, respectively. The molecule with bithiophene as π-bridges demonstrated stronger absorbance and higher hole mobility than the molecule with thiophene π-bridges, and consequently, a higher PCE was obtained under the same conditions. In addition to thiophene and bithiophene, trithiophene also functioned as a π conjugated spacer, and the results indicate that the trithiophene bridging molecule displayed promising advantages for optical and electrical characteristics in organic solar cells,23,35 such as, longer conjugated length, decreasing bandgap, and improved π–π intermolecular interactions. As an analogue of thiophene, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) was widely applied as a π-spacer in D–A copolymers for high efficiency devices, due to its symmetric configuration and excellent hole mobility. Hou et al.37 reported a pair of donor–acceptor (D–π–A) type polymers with the same donor and acceptor moieties but different π-bridge units. The polymer with thiophene as the π-bridge showed a typical zigzag configuration, while the polymer with thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as the π-bridge displayed a more straight configuration. Their results indicated that the polymer with thienothiophene showed very strong J-aggregation even in the solution state, and also demonstrated more ordered laminar packing as well as stronger intermolecular π–π stacking in the solid film. And consequently, the hole mobility and photovoltaic performance of the linear polymer showed obvious superiority to those of the zigzag polymer. Recently, Yang et al.38 synthesized D–π–A copolymers with the same donors and acceptors but different π spacers. When the π bridges change from 2,2-bithiophene to thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, the peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) approaches 80%, and the PCE is also improved from 3.3% to 7.71%. These results indicate that the rational structural modulation by altering the π bridges is an effective method to achieve high device performance in both polymer and small molecule based OSCs.
Recently, we have reported a small molecular DCATT, with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene (BDT) as the donor moiety, alkyl cyanoacetate as the acceptor moiety, and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) flanked with two thiophenes as the π bridging building block for efficient solution processed OSCs (Fig. 1).39 Although both BDT and TT show a linear and symmetric skeleton, DCATT possesses a backbone with a zigzag configuration, which may not be beneficial for intermolecular interactions. Interestingly, if we make a subtle modification on the π bridge configuration of DCATT, that is, exchanging the locations of the terminal aromatic unit thiophene (T) and the middle aromatic unit thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT), the molecule will be characterized by a more planar configuration (Fig. 1). Consequently, based on our previous results of DCATT, we have designed and synthesized another A–π–D–π–A solution-processable molecule denoted as DCATT-L, which features the same aromatic compositions, except for a different π-bridge configuration compared to DCATT. SMOSC devices with a conventional device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DCATT-L:PC61BM/Ca/Al were fabricated. The best device exhibited a high PCE of 7.72% after thermal annealing at a low temperature of 80 °C for 10 min, with a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.98 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 11.38 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.69. All the crucial parameters of OSCs have been simultaneously improved compared to those of the isomer DCATT (with a VOC of 0.89 V, a JSC of 8.83 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.66, and a PCE of 5.20%).39

Experimental section
General information
All starting materials and reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used without further purification. Toluene was distilled over sodium and freshly distilled prior to use. All coupling reactions were conducted under purified argon and monitored by Merck silica gel thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation. It is equipped with a three-electrode cell consisting of a glassy carbon working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) reference electrode and a platinum wire counter electrode. The measurements were carried out in anhydrous acetonitrile containing 0.1 M tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6) as a supporting electrolyte under an argon atmosphere at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Thin films were deposited from chloroform solution onto the working electrodes and dried under nitrogen prior to measurements. The redox potential of the Fc/Fc+ internal reference is 0.40 V vs. SCE. The ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) were determined by calculating the empirical formula of IP = (Eox + 4.8 − ) and EA = (Ered + 4.8 − ), where Eox and Ered are the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively. The structures of the DCATT-L/PC61BM blends were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 ADVANCE). 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained on a Bruker Advance III 600 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS, δ = 0 ppm) as an internal standard. High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were recorded in the APCI mode on a Thermo Fisher Q-Exactive TOF spectrometer. UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained on a Lambda25 spectrophotometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were carried out by using a SDT Q600 V20.9 Build 20 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were acquired with an Agilent-5400 scanning probe microscope with a Nanodrive controller in the tapping mode with MikroMasch NSC-15 AFM tips with resonant frequencies ∼300 kHz. Bright field transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data were acquired using a HITACHI H-7650 electron microscope operating at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. The ground state geometries of molecules were fully optimized with the density functional theory (DFT) method at the B3LYP/6-31 G(d) level.40

Fabrication and characterization of devices
Organic solar cells were fabricated with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DCATT-L:PC61BM/Ca/Al. Patterned ITO-coated glass was cleaned with ITO detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min each time, and then exposed to oxygen plasma for 6 min. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron PVP Al 4083) was spin-coated onto ITO-coated glass substrates, followed by annealing at 160 °C for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the substrates were transferred to a glovebox. The active layer consisting of DCATT-L and PC61BM was spin-coated from chloroform (CHCl3) solution (10 mg mL−1) onto the PEDOT:PSS layer. The spin-coating was performed in a glovebox. The thickness of the active layer was controlled by changing the spin speed during the spin coating process and estimated using a Veeco Dektak150 surface profiler in our laboratory. Finally, after the samples were transferred to a vacuum chamber, Ca (10 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited via a mask to define the active area of 0.10 cm2. The PCE was calculated from the current density–voltage (J–V) curves which were recorded by using a Keithley 2420 source meter under illumination of an AM 1.5G solar simulator with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity was calibrated by using a standard silicon photodiode. The EQE of solar cells was analyzed using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route to linear compound DCATT-L is shown in Scheme 1. The precursors of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2-carbaldehyde (1), 5-bromothieno-[3,2-b]thiophene-2-carbaldehyde (2), 5-(4-octylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2-carbaldehyde (3), 5-(5-bromo-4-octylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2-carbaldehyde (4), 5-(3,4′-dioctyl-2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2-carbaldehyde (5) and 5-(5′-bromo-3,4′-dioctyl-2,2′-bithiophen-5-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2-carbaldehyde (6) were synthesized according to the reported literature.41–43 Trimethyl(4-octylthien-2-yl)stannane and 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl-)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (7) were synthesized according to the literature procedures.41,43–45

The key precursor 8 was prepared through the Stille coupling reaction using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst and toluene as the solvent. Finally, the target molecule DCATT-L was facilely synthesized by the Knoevenagel reaction in a yield of 67%. The important intermediates and DCATT-L were fully characterized, and the NMR and HRMS spectra of DCATT-L are presented in the ESI (Fig. S1–3†). The molecule exhibits good solubility in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and so forth.
The thermal stability of the compound was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. S4†) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. As shown in Fig. S4,† the molecule exhibits good thermal stability with onset decomposition temperature with a 5% weight loss (Td) occurring at 379 °C, which is similar to that of DCATT (369 °C). The thermal stability of DCATT-L is enough to ensure the photovoltaic device fabrication.
Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 2 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of DCATT and DCATT-L in dilute chloroform solutions (both with c = 4.89 × 10−6 M) and as thin films. As shown in Fig. 2a, the spectra of DCATT and DCATT-L in chloroform solution exhibit almost identical absorption profiles (400–600 nm) with the same peaks at about 495 nm, which is ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition between the donor unit (BDT flanked with thiophene) and the acceptor unit (2-ethylhexyl cyanoacetate).46,47 However, along with changing the π bridge structure through rearranging the location of thiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene, DCATT-L in solution exhibits an improved molar extinction coefficient (ε = 2.2 × 105 M−1 cm−1) compared to that of DCATT (ε = 1.4 × 105 M−1 cm−1). Both the absorption coefficients of the two molecules are comparable to those of some reported materials.48 As shown in Fig. 2b, the absorption peak of the DCATT-L film cast from chloroform solution was at 567 nm, which is red-shifted by 11 nm compared to that of DCATT (556 nm). The DCATT-L film has no obvious shoulder peak, which is similar to the absorption of the DCATT film. The full width at half maximum of DCATT-L is larger than that of DCATT by ∼16 nm. In addition, by changing the π-bridge configuration, the absorption edge is also slightly red-shifted to 709 nm, corresponding to its optical band gap of 1.75 eV, which is smaller than that of DCATT (1.85 eV). Table 1 summarizes the optical data, including the absorption peak wavelengths (λmax) in solution and film, the optical bandgap (Eoptg), and energy levels of DCATT and DCATT-L. The comparison between the absorption spectra of DCATT and DCATT-L clearly confirms that the delicate manipulation of the π-bridge configuration of the molecule is beneficial for more efficient light absorption, which would be a better donor for OSCs.

The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the two molecules are shown in Fig. 3. The onset potentials of the p-doping process of DCATT and DCATT-L are 0.69 and 0.77 V, respectively, corresponding to the HOMO level of −5.10 and −5.18 eV.49,50 Since it is hard to obtain a sharp n-doping curve for DCATT, the LUMO energy level of DCATT, calculated from the HOMO and its optical bandgap, is −3.25 eV. Similarly, no obvious onset reduction potential of DCATT-L was found, so the LUMO level is also calculated from its HOMO and optical band gap, which is −3.39 eV. Considering that the open circuit voltage (VOC) of OSCs is closely related to the offset between the HOMO level of the electron donor material and the LUMO level of the electron acceptor material,51–53 the lower HOMO achieved by changing the π-bridge configuration should have some positive influence on VOC in OSCs.

Theoretical calculations
In order to further understand the π-bridge effect on the molecular architecture and optoelectronic properties, density functional theory (DFT) calculation was also performed to investigate the geometries of the molecules DCATT and DCATT-L (Fig. 4), using the Gaussian 09 program suite at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level in the gas phase. All the alkyl side chains were replaced with methyl groups to simplify the computation. The optimized molecular structure was confirmed to be in a stable local minimum of the ground state potential energy surface by computing vibrational frequencies at the same level of theory. As shown in Fig. S5,† the backbone of DCATT shows a typical zigzag conformation with an angle of 38.3°, while the backbone of DCATT-L has a more straight conformation with an angle of 20.1°, which is nearly half of DCATT. These results clearly indicate that when the π bridge configuration has been modified, the backbone conformation of the resulted molecule would show an evident change.

In addition to the optimized geometry, the stimulated electron density distributions are also shown in Fig. 4. It can be found that the electron density of the HOMO for DCATT is delocalized on BDT and adjacent T1 and TT units. Interestingly, the LUMO distributed not only on the electron withdrawing terminal group but also on T2 and TT groups. Both the HOMO and LUMO delocalized on TT units, however, only the LUMO delocalized on the T2 and terminal groups. As for DCATT-L, the HOMO energy level is found on the central BDT and flanked T1 and T2, while the LUMO energy level is delocalized on the terminal ethylhexyl cyanoacetate groups, TT and T2. Of note, compared with DCATT, DCATT-L shows a shorter HOMO delocalization length, and a longer LUMO delocalization length, which would result in lower HOMO and LUMO energy levels. The results are consistent with the experimental results.
The theoretical calculation results indicated that changing the configuration of the π-bridging building block plays a dominant role in optical and electrical characteristics. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report on regulating the A–π–D–π–A small molecules' energy levels and bandgaps by tuning the electronic properties of the π-bridging group until now. This is the proposed strategy on designing novel A–π–D–π–A small molecules for highly efficient SM-OSCs.
Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of DCATT-L were investigated by fabricating OSC devices, and the structure used in this work was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DCATT-L:PC61BM/Ca/Al tested under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 light. Chloroform was used as the solvent and the concentration of the solution was 10 mg mL−1. Initially, different DCATT-L/PC61BM ratios (2:1, 1:1 and 1:2) were scanned. It is found that the optimal D–A ratio for DCATT-L-based devices is 2:1 and the device showed a VOC of 0.98 V, a JSC of 7.88 mA cm−2 and a FF of 61% with the corresponding PCE of 4.71%. Interestingly, thermal annealing at 80 °C for 10 minutes can further enhance the efficiency of the device to 7.72%, with a VOC of 0.98 V, a JSC of 11.38 mA cm−2 and a FF of 69%. Fig. 5a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DCATT-L based OSCs with and without thermal annealing, and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. However, the device of DCATT-L was not further improved when treating with different ratios of additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). The EQE curves of the OSCs based on DCATT-L prepared before and after thermal annealing are provided in Fig. 5b. The device without any treatment shows a low photo-response (below 50%), while after thermal annealing at 80 °C, the photo-response is enhanced to around 70%. To understand the reason for the improvement, UV-vis absorption spectra of the DCATT-L:PC61BM (2:1) blending film were measured. As shown in Fig. 5c, the film exhibited a broad absorption range from 350 to 700 nm. After thermal annealing, the active film shows a broader absorption range, and an obvious shoulder peak was found at 574 nm. We assume that the improvement of JSC may be attributed to the broader absorption range and higher absorption coefficient. The JSC calculated from the EQE curve is 11.28 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the JSC value obtained from the J–V curve (11.38 mA cm−2).

Apparently, compared with DCATT, the device based on DCATT-L shows an improved PCE under their respective optimal conditions, with simultaneously increasing VOC, JSC and FF. The higher VOC could be attributed to its lower HOMO level. Meanwhile, the EQE of the optimized device based on DCATT with treatment of both thermal annealing and additives was below 60%, which is lower than that of DCATT-L. We also compared the UV-vis absorption spectra of the two molecules:PC61BM blending films. As shown in Fig. S6,† the DCATT-L:PC61BM film shows wider absorption spectra and a higher absorption coefficient (ε, 0.32 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for DCATT-L and 0.27 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for DCATT under their respective optimized conditions), which would account for the higher JSC. We propose that the slightly increasing FF of the DCATT-L device may stem from the superior charge mobility and morphology, as discussed below.
The carrier charge mobility is an important parameter, which would affect charge separation, transport and recombination.54 The mobility of DCATT-L was investigated by employing a vertical diode with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/DCATT-L/Au. According to the J–V curve as shown in Fig. S7,† the mobility of the device without annealing is about 3.6 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 calculated using a space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) model,55,56 which is described by the equation JSCLC = (9/8)ε0εrμh((V2)/(L3)), where J stands for the current density, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, μh is the hole mobility, V is the internal potential in the device and L is the thickness of the active layer. After thermal annealing at 80 °C, the mobility was enhanced to 1.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is also slightly larger than that of the DCATT film (1.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The improved hole mobility after annealing resulted from the ordered film microstructure of the DCATT-L backbone. And also such a substantial mobility value of DCATT-L partially contributes to the higher FF and JSC.
XRD and morphology
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were used to reveal the crystallinity of the molecule in thin films. The XRD patterns of the films of DCATT-L blended with PC61BM cast from chloroform are shown in Fig. 6. It is very clear that the film exhibited a strong first-order (100) diffraction peak at 2θ of 4.4°, corresponding to the d100-spacing of 20.1 Å, which is identical to that of DCATT.39 Unexpectedly, the lamellar distance was not diminished in spite of the more linear backbone. We ascribed that the d100-spacing is mainly determined by the long side alkyl chains, so the slight change of the π-bridge configuration will not influence it obviously. The pattern clearly showed that the peak was sharply increased after annealing, indicating that the molecule further crystallized. The d100-spacing of both DCATT and DCATT-L is smaller than those of the reported molecules,20,57,58 which indicates that the introduction of the π bridging TT unit results in strong intermolecular interactions.
 Fig. 6  X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of active layer films spin-coated from CHCl3 solution. 
The influence of thermal annealing on the surface morphologies of the blend films was explored by AFM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 7(a) and (c), the surface of the DCATT-L film without any post-processing features a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness value of ca. 1.9 nm. After thermal annealing at 80 °C, the film remains uniform with a similar RMS value of ca. 2.0 nm (Fig. 7(b) and (d)). According to the TEM images (Fig. 7(e) and (f)), before annealing, the dark and light domains, which correspond to the polymer and PC61BM, respectively, tend to aggregate. However, after thermal annealing, it can be observed that better phase separation and interpenetrating networks of DCATT-L and PC61BM were formed with the assistance of annealing. This could contribute to the enhanced transport and collection of charge carriers, which resulted in the improvement of JSC and FF.
 Fig. 7  The AFM height images (top), phase images (middle) and TEM images (bottom) of DCATT-L:PC61BM films without (a, c, and e) and with (b, d, and f) thermal annealing. 
On the other hand, the DCATT:PC61BM blend films with and without any treatment are composed of lots of sphericities and domain boundaries with a large RMS roughness of ca. 6.26 nm.39 Obvious phase separation of DCATT-based films was found in the TEM image and the scale was about 100 nm, which is much larger than the common optimal phase separation of 10–20 nm.39 The results indicated that the configuration of the π-bridging building block also has some influence on the miscibility with PCBM.
Conclusion
A new solution-processed molecule, named DCATT-L, an isomer of DCATT reported in our previous work, was designed and synthesized. Both molecules have the same building blocks, but different π-bridge configurations. When the π-bridge building block was rearranged, the resulting isomer DCATT-L showed more efficient light absorption and a lower HOMO level and also demonstrated to form a more ordered structure in the BHJ film. Thus the photovoltaic performance of DCATT-L was greatly enhanced compared to that of DCATT. It can be concluded that the configuration of the π-bridge plays an important role in improving the device properties, and hence provides a guideline for further designing highly efficient small molecules for organic solar cells.
