    , Accepted 14th April 2023First published on 14th April 2023AbstractThe triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is a novel device that efficiently converts mechanical energy into electrical energy; such devices have been used in fields such as energy harvesting, intelligent monitoring, environmental protection, wearable electronic materials, micro/nano-power sources, robotics, and self-powered sensors. Recently, waste-derived carbonized materials (WDCMs) have been widely used to fabricate TENGs, considering their low-cost, abundance, and environmental friendliness. WDCMs exhibit good electrical and thermal conductivity, high-level corrosion-resistance, flexibility, and hydrophobicity. The advantages of WDCM-based TENGs are high output, moisture-resistance, flexibility, and the capacity to function in extreme environments. Here, we summarize the preparation methods, working mechanisms, unique advantages, applications, and the prospect of WDCM-based TENGs. This review may inspire the continued development of waste-based energy-harvesting devices.
1. Introduction
Advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) have led to distributed sensing technologies that increasingly require distributed and random energy, including solar, wind, and mechanical energy. The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), invented by Z. L. Wang in 2012, converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.1 TENGs have been used in many fields, including energy harvesting, wearable electronic devices, environmental protection, robotics, and self-powered sensors.2,3 Typically, a TENG device exhibits two components: a dielectric layer (with positive and negative poles) and conductive electrodes. TENGs convert mechanical to electrical energy through contact charging and electrostatic induction via repetitive periodic contact/separation of two different materials. This mechanism drives electron flow from one electrode to the other along the direction of high to low electrochemical potential, based on the difference in electronegativity.4,5 TENG energy conversion performance is determined by the extent of surface charge transfer during periodic contact/separation. There are two basic methods by which to improve TENGs performance: enhancement of the dielectric layer charge density and reduction of the barrier to interfacial electron transport. Various methods have been used to enhance charge transfer at the interfaces of contacting surfaces, including optimization of the device structure, use of novel or modified TENG materials, charging of the dielectric layer via polarization or a corona, and incorporation of highly conductive electrode materials.6–10
Recently, waste-derived carbonized materials (WDCMs) have become recognized as low-cost, renewable, green, and sustainable substrates for TENG buildings. WDCMs include almost all carbon allotropes. The use of various carbonization methods modulates the electrical, mechanical, and chemical properties of WDCMs, as well as their morphologies. Thus, WDCMs exhibit various functionalities.11–13 Considering the high conductivity, flexibility, high thermal conductivity, corrosion-resistance, and hydrophobicity of WDCMs, TENGs fabricated from WDCMs commonly exhibit excellent outputs, ductility, and humidity-resistance.14–17
Here, we review TENG theory and applications of TENGs based on WDCMs (Fig. 1) from the following aspects: (1) WDCM preparation and characteristics, as well as the utilities of WDCM-derived TENGs; (2) the mechanisms by which WDCMs serve as both dielectric and conductive layers that improve TENG outputs, flexibility, and humidity-resistance; and (3) the applications of WDCM-based TENGs in energy harvesting, intelligent monitoring, and self-powered systems. TENG research hotspots and challenges are also discussed.

2. The TENG paradigm
Mechanical energy harvesting and conversion yield most of the electricity used today (Fig. 2). The electromagnetic generator of Faraday has dominated electricity generation since 1831.28 In 1861, Maxwell derived equations that unified electromagnetism and displacement current.29 In 2012, the TENG was invented by Wang.1 The TENG is a novel device that converts mechanical energy into electrical energy through an interaction between triboelectric induction and electrostatic induction. The triboelectric effect develops when two dielectric layers come into contact and then separate; electrons are transferred from a positive to a negative dielectric layer. As the contact/separation cycles continue, the two dielectric layers alternately carry opposite charges of similar magnitude, and electrons generate an alternating current output through an external circuit to perform work.30–32 In 2017, a new Wang term (Ps) was added to Maxwell's equations to incorporate the TENG mechanism, as described below.
 Fig. 2  The development of electromagnetic theory and the historical nodes of TENG events. Modified from literature1 (copyright 2012 Elsevier),32 (copyright 2018 Springer Nature),33 (copyright 2022 Elsevier). 
The basic physical TENG is based on Maxwell's displacement current (JD) of eqn (1). The displacement current arises when the transient electric field triggers dielectric polarization of the medium, thus converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. Because the surface charge is independent of the electric field, the Wang term is added to Maxwell's equations to reflect the TENG working mechanism (Fig. 3(a and b)).34 (1)where E, P, and Ps are the electric field, medium polarization vector, and a term reflecting the presence of electrostatic surface charges, respectively; ε and ε0 are the permittivities of the dielectrics and vacuum, respectively.

(f) Freestanding triboelectric-layer mode of TENG. 
Because frictional charges on a dielectric surface will drive electrode electron flow to balance the potential drop,35 four basic TENG operating modes have been proposed (Fig. 3(c–f)): single-electrode,36,37 vertical contact-separation,38,39 lateral-sliding,40,41 and freestanding triboelectric layer.42,43
2.1. Single-electrode mode
The ground serves as the reference electrode when converting mechanical energy into electrical energy (Fig. 3(c)). As contact begins, the generated charge is evenly distributed on the other contact surface; electrical equilibrium is established. After separation, the conductive layer induces a negative charge, creating a potential difference with the ground; electrons of the external circuit flow from the ground to the conductive layer. When the separation becomes wider, free electrons stop flowing, and electrostatic balance is established. When contact is restored, electrons in the external circuit flow back to the ground, thus producing a reverse current. When contact is complete, the original state is restored.
2.2. Vertical contact-separation mode
The vertical contact-separation mode involves motion perpendicular to the interface. During contact separation, a potential difference between the two electrodes is generated; an external current develops to balance this difference. A TENG operating in the vertical contact-separation mode is shown in (Fig. 3(d)). In the initial state, no charge is generated. When an external force is applied, the electrodes of the two friction layers contact; opposite charges are transferred between the surfaces of the contact interface. When the external force is released, the two dielectric materials move up and down in relative terms, accompanied by charge transfer; this movement generates an electrical signal until the release is maximal and the charge is balanced. When pressure is applied, the free charge flows back through the circuit, thus completing the electricity generation cycle.
2.3. Lateral-sliding mode
In the lateral-sliding mode, lateral triboelectric changes the potentials of two electrodes and then allows electrical output to the external circuit. The working principle is shown in (Fig. 3(e)). Initially, there is full contact; the respective friction layers are positively and negatively charged. Static equilibrium is involved. As the triboelectric moves to the right, the contact area decreases; the charges in the plane separate. The amount of charge transferred to the electrode is equal to the amount of charge that is separated during sliding. The displacement is then reversed and contact is re-established; excess electrons in the electrode flow back to establish a new electrostatic equilibrium when the full overlap is restored.
2.4. Freestanding triboelectric-layer mode
In the freestanding triboelectric-layer mode, two separate layers mediate the triboelectrification effect generated by the dielectrics on both sides of a metal film. The dielectrics serve as triboelectrification materials, as well as electrodes; the working mechanism is shown in (Fig. 3(f)). As contact between the friction layer and the electrode begins, the negative charge on the surface is equal to the positive charge on the electrode surface; electrostatic equilibrium is involved. There is no charge transfer between the electrodes. As the friction layer moves to the right, the area of electrode overlap changes, causing electrons to flow from the left electrode to the right electrode; this balances the local potential distribution. Until the right electrode is overlapped, all positive charges flow to the right electrode, and a new equilibrium is attained. The pattern is repeated during reverse movement, generating an alternating current output.
3. WDCMs preparation, WDCMs characterization, and applied in TENGs
Carbon is the basic building block of all living things. Carbon atoms are covalently bonded to form allotropes (Fig. 4), such as carbon dot (CD), carbon black (CB), carbon nanotube (CNT), carbon fiber (CNF), graphene, graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), carbon aerogel (CA), carbon spheres (CS) etc. Carbon allotropes exhibit versatile and surprising properties considering the extended networks of carbon atoms in various hybridization states (sp, sp2, and sp3).44 For example, diamond is a well-known electrical insulator; it constitutes a completely transparent crystalline material formed from sp3-hybridized carbon atoms. In contrast, graphite exhibits multiple monolayers associated with substantial electrical conductivity and flexibility because of densely packed aromatic (sp2) carbon atoms. Based on the strong covalent sp2 bonds of carbon atoms, CNTs exhibit thermal conductivity that is roughly an order of magnitude greater than the thermal conductivities of metals.45 WDCMs are an important source of carbon because of their wide availability, low cost, environmental friendliness, and versatility. Common carbonization methods include pyrolysis, hydrothermal methods, vapor deposition, and laser carbonization. WDCMs prepared via such methods exhibit high electrical and thermal conductivities, good flexibility, and high-level hydrophobicity; thus, they can be used to prepare high-performance TENGs that differ from conventional TENGs in terms of improved performance, humidity-resistance, flexibility, and flame-retarding capacity.

3.1. Methods of WDCM preparation

3.1.1. High-temperature carbonization. 
High-temperature carbonization generates WDCMs in the presence of an inert gas or an oxygen barrier; it occurs in tube or muffle furnaces that break the chemical bonds of biological macromolecules and cause thermochemical decomposition to desorb small hydrocarbons, thus yielding WDCMs. High-temperature pyrolysis is inexpensive, environmentally friendly, and continuous; the WDCMs exhibit high specific surface areas and good conductivity.46 The use of such WDCMs to fabricate TENGs increases the TENG surface charge density and current, thereby enhancing efficiency. As shown in (Fig. 5), Li et al. developed a biomass-derived, metal-free durable TENG. The current increased from 1.1 to 2.1 μA as the frequency increased; this output was better than the output of strip-coated nylon yarn tested under the same conditions.23 Wang et al. used natural protein carbonization to obtain carbonized nanofibers that were then used to fabricate a pressure sensor with a fast response time (<16.7 ms) and an ultra-low detection limit of 0.8 Pa. This sensor can be used to monitor human physiological signals considering its excellent sensitivity.47

3.1.2. Hydrothermal carbonization. 
Hydrothermal carbonization effectively converts biomass into energy-dense carbon and has become widely used because it is both environmentally friendly and economical. The reaction vessel must withstand high pressures and temperatures; water is the reaction solvent. Many reactants dissolve in water; carbon-rich solid products are synthesized under subcritical and supercritical hydrothermal conditions. Most such WDCMs exhibit high specific surface areas, high porosities, and excellent electrical properties when used to fabricate TENGs. Various WDCMs have been prepared in this manner (Fig. 6). For example, Xia et al. combined alginic acid with various cations from seawater, then implemented a hydrothermal method to form WDCMs for use in the fabrication of TENGs that formed triboelectric pairs with polytetrafluoroethylene; the output illuminated 93 high-power light-emitting diodes.50
 Fig. 6  WDCM are prepared by hydrothermal carbonization51 (copyright 2022 Elsevier),52 (copyright 2022 Elsevier),53 (copyright 2021 Elsevier),54 (copyright 2018 John Wiley and Sons). 


3.1.3. Chemical vapor deposition. 
Chemical vapor deposition has rapidly developed and is now commonly used to prepare WDCMs. During chemical vapor deposition, gaseous substances react on solid surfaces to form solid films. Heat, plasma, and light can be used to energize the reactants; internal chemical bonds are broken or relaxed, and new bonds form to create films or coatings. WDCMs prepared in this manner exhibit good graphitization and high porosity (Fig. 7). Surface chemical modification improves porosity and TENG performance because electrostatic induction generates a greater charge on pore surfaces; this modification improves the electrical output and the output voltage. Zheng et al. developed a flexible TENG based on a carbonized polymer aerogel fabricated from cellulose with 84% porosity and polyimide (PI) with 92% porosity, which served as the positive and negative electrode materials, respectively.55 The porous surface of the modified cellulose aerogel was subjected to aminosilanization using chemical vapor deposition, the porosity can be improved and enhanced the TENG electrical output three-fold. This approach facilitates the development of new electrode materials and high-performance electronic devices.

3.1.4. Laser carbonization. 
In contrast to conventional carbonization methods, laser carbonization uses a laser beam incident on the surfaces of biomass materials and polymer films to trigger local carbonization. The laser heats the surface at a rate of up to 1000 °C s−1, rapidly generating extremely high temperatures; this is followed by carbonization and graphitization to form porous graphenes, which are low-cost, environmentally friendly, and biodegradable WDCMs.61,62 Such WDCMs exhibit excellent conductivity, high electronic density, and mechanical flexibility; they can serve as thin-film electrodes in the conductive layers of TENGs. Moreover, the charges generated by friction can be transferred without the use of adhesives or conductive agents.63 Therefore, the interface resistance between the dielectric material and the electrode is reduced, lowering the charge transfer barrier and improving TENG conductive efficiency.
(Fig. 8) shows how multi-pulse laser scribing can be used to convert various substrates into laser-induced graphene (LIG); waste food, paper, and wood, as well as PI, constitute renewable precursors. This method can convert any precursor of amorphous carbon into porous graphene with excellent electrical conductivity. Lee et al. used a fiber LIG composite prepared via laser carbonization as a TENG material. The output voltage was 180 V and the peak power could reach 512 mW m−2.64 The TENG was also very flexible and stretchable; thus, it could be used to prepare wearables.

As mentioned above, we classified carbonized materials into 0D, 1D, 2D, and 3D according to dimensions, and introduced several methods for preparing carbonized materials. Considering that carbon source is also an important factor determining the dimension difference of WDCMs, we summarized the WDCMs obtained from carbon sources treated by different carbonization methods in Table 1.

3.2. Characteristics of WDCMs

3.2.1. High conductivity. 
Because TENGs are principally used to harvest high-entropy energy, they will undoubtedly be popularized by the development of low-cost, environmentally friendly, and recyclable electrodes. Considering their excellent electrical conductivity and corrosion-resistance, WDCM electrodes have been widely used in solar cells, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. The Fermi level of carbon (5.0 eV) is close to the Fermi levels of gold (5.1 eV), platinum (5.65 eV), silver (4.26 eV), copper (4.65 eV), and indium tin oxide (4.5 eV); carbon is an alternative to conventional electrodes.104 Recent studies have revealed that WDCMs exhibit various metal-doable allotropes; the Fermi levels range from 4.5 to 5.2 eV. Thus, all-WDCM TENGs are possible. Hu et al. prepared highly conductive microfibers by carbonizing a mixture of well-arranged GO and nanofibrillated cellulose.105 GO served as the carbonization template, and the cellulose was converted from microspheres to sheets; the carbonized GO and cellulose were stacked together. The microfiber conductivity was 649 ± 60 S cm−1. Alptekin et al. converted nut shells and corncobs into WDCMs of high electrical conductivity using a hydrothermal method.106 The materials were activated with KOH, NaOH, H3PO4, or ZnCl2 at 500 °C, 600 °C, 700 °C, and 800 °C for 1, 1.5, or 2 h. Electrical conductivity increased according to carbonization temperature. Highly conductive WDCMs of 4.24 × 10−3 S Ω−1 were obtained via NaOH activation at 800 °C for 2 h.


3.2.2. Flexibility. 
Flexible WDCM-based electrodes exhibit good electrical conductivity, low cost, and environmental friendliness; they are amenable to large-scale production. The carbonized precursors are commonly derived from paper, cotton, fabrics, and polymers with layered fibrous microstructures. After carbonization, the microstructures are retained and cross-linked; the WDCMs often exhibit excellent flexibility and ductility. Ziaie B. et al. described a simple, low-cost laser carbonization technique for the preparation of highly ductile composite carbonized films.107 WDCMs produced via laser pyrolysis of thermosetting polymers (such as PI) are embedded into elastomeric substrates (e.g., polydimethylsiloxane [PDMS]). This approach ensures that the embedded WDCMs (partially aligned graphene and CNTs) remain anisotropic. The resulting composite carbonized film exhibits stretchability of up to 100% and resistance as low as 60 Ω (Fig. 9(a)). Xu et al. reported a facile, low-cost, and scalable method by which to fabricate highly flexible and anisotropic strain sensors from biomass-derived materials; this approach was used to carbonize commercial crepe paper.108 The sensors exhibited fast responses (<115 ms), high flexibility, and excellent durability (>10000 cycles). The respective tensile gauge factors of the sensors were 10.10 and 0.14 perpendicular and parallel to the fiber direction. Such anisotropic sensing reflects the unique anisotropic structure of commercial crepe paper. The ability of carbonized commercial crepe paper sensors to detect complex human motions and control machines suggests that they will have applications in wearable electronics and intelligent robots (Fig. 9(b)).

(b) Commercial crepe paper is carbonized at high temperatures into a flexible film108 (copyright 2018 John Wiley and Sons). 


3.2.3. High thermal conductivity. 
Generally, thermal conduction in carbon materials is dominated by phonons. The simple eqn (2) of gas kinetic theory is: (2)where K is the thermal conductivity, Cp is the specific heat capacity, ν is the phonon group velocity, and λ is the phonon mean free path.109K is principally determined by the intrinsic microstructures of WDCMs. The covalent sp2 carbon structures efficiently transport phonons via lattice vibrations. However, considering the existence of boundaries, defects, and impurities, such phonon transport is often impaired. Heat effectively repairs sp2 carbon structures and increases K; WDCMs often exhibit excellent thermal conductivity. Guo et al. described a composite of three-dimensional carbonized cellulose/boric acid with a ball mill-modified boron nitride aerogel (CCA/m-BN) in an epoxy resin (EP).110 At a low m-BN loading of 9.6 wt%, CCA/m-BN/EP exhibited a maximum thermal conductivity of 2.11 W mK−1, which is approximately 11.1 folds greater than the conductivity of pure polyethylene (0.19 W mK−1). The CCA/m-BN/EP composite exhibited high thermal conductivity and good flame-retarding capacity; thus, it may be useful as a heat-dissipation material in next-generation electronic devices (Fig. 10).

3.2.4. Hydrophobicity. 
Hydrophobicity refers to the tendency of some molecules (hydrophobes) to engage in mutual repulsion with water.111 Polar water forms internal hydrogen bonds, explaining its many unique properties. However, hydrophobes do not form such bonds; instead, they repel water and promote the formation of inter-water hydrogen bonds. Considering the presence of two immiscible phases (hydrophilic and hydrophobic), the interface phase exhibits a smaller area.112 Because high temperatures remove hydrophilic groups from solid surfaces, WDCMs are often hydrophobic. Long et al. prepared a novel, robust hydrophobic carbon aerogel via low-temperature carbonization of cellulose nanofibers in a deep eutectic solvent (Fig. 11(a)) comprising glucose and choline chloride.113 Fourier transform infrared test results showed that, as the pyrolysis temperature gradually increased, the principal absorption peaks of functional groups (O–H, CH3, CO, CH2, and C–O) gradually weakened and eventually disappeared (Fig. 11(b)); this process yielded superhydrophobic WDCMs. When the pyrolysis temperature was 350 °C, the WDCMs exhibited optimal hydrophobicity, with a contact angle of approximately 140° (Fig. 11(c)).

3.3. Advantages of TENGs fabricated from WDCMs

3.3.1. High-performance WDCM-based TENGs. 
3.3.1.1 WDCMs serve as dielectric layers. 
Dielectric layers of doped carbonized polymers enhance TENG performance. The combination of a carbonized material and a polymer is assumed to enhance the dielectric constant of the dielectric layer; this constant is assumed to increase as the carbon content increases, facilitating greater charge accumulation on the layer surface and thus improving TENG electrical output. Choi et al. used WDCMs hybridized with PDMS as a dielectric layer to enhance the output performances of TENGs (Fig. 12(a)).114 TENG theory suggests that friction between PDMS and other materials will generate negative charges on PDMS, thus generating an electric field that induces a positive charge on the bottom conducting layer. Negative charges move toward the conductive layer via diffusion and/or electromigration. Thus, output enhancement entirely depends on the ability of the contact layer materials to store charge. In this context, conductive carbon particles in the composite layer effectively trap migrating negative charges, thus “storing” them (Fig. 12(b)) and significantly increasing the charge storage capacity. Park et al. used a laser-carbonized MXene/ZiF-67 nanocomposite-based dielectric layer when fabricating both contact and noncontact-mode TENGs; the electrical outputs were excellent because the porous structure of the laser-carbonized MXene/ZiF-67 nanocomposite layer was associated with a high charge density.22 Surface charge was adequately retained over time, increasing the surface potential of the dielectric layer. Under optimal conditions, such intermediate and charge-generating layers significantly enhanced the contact TENG output power density to 65 W m−2 at a load resistance of 1.3 MΩ under a force of 10 N and frequency of 4 Hz; this power density was seven-fold greater than the density of a TENG lacking the intermediate layer. The noncontact TENG exhibited a high charge density of 15.3 μC m−2 and stable output performance at a distance of 2 cm.

(b) Output enhancement mechanism in chronological order by varying the material of the contact layer with and without carbon particle fillers114 (copyright 2021 Elsevier). 
3.3.1.2 WDCMs as conducting layers. 
Electrode material significantly affects TENG performance and function. Highly conductive aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), magnesium (Mg), gold (Au), and indium tin oxide have been used as TENG electrodes. However, most are solid/rigid films, which limit TENG applications to stretchable and flexible devices; these electrodes are also susceptible to corrosion under harsh working conditions. Other high-performance electrode materials are required for use in nanogenerators of the future. Carbonized materials are increasingly used as TENG electrodes, considering their good electrical conductivity and ductility. Several recent studies showed that micromorphological tuning of the carbon-electrode interface significantly influenced TENG outputs. Luo et al. prepared a TENG electrode using a double-sided, conductive carbon ribbon fabricated from carbon powder; then, they created a high-performance TENG from spin coated planar PDMS and a polyamide 6 (PA6) film (Fig. 13(a)). The output voltage of a 20 × 20 mm2 carbon-PDMS/PA6 TENG was approximately 1760 V and the current density was approximately 240 mA m−2; the power density of ∼120 W m−2 was much higher than the density of an Al-PDMS/PA6 TENG with aluminum electrodes.115 Furthermore, TENGs were prepared from C-PDMS-PA6 (with pores) and c-PDMS-PA6 (without pores). TENGs prepared from C-PDMS-PA6 exhibited significantly higher charge densities and outputs, which were attributable to additional interactions in pores between the coarse carbon electrode and the PDMS film; they also enhanced the electronegativity of PDMS film that was imparted by exfoliation and transfer treatments. This simple and low-cost strategy can be used to prepare electrode materials with micro/nanostructures that optimize interactions with dielectric layers, thus generating additional triboelectric charges in high-performance TENGs.

(b) Comparison of performance output of PI paper-based TENG with metal (Al) and LIG as conductive layers respectively21 (copyright 2020 Elsevier). 
The enhancement of dielectric layer charge density is the main approach when seeking to improve TENG output; it also effectively reduces the electron transfer barrier between dielectric and conductive layers. Soin et al. reported the simple synthesis of an efficient TENG electrode from highly crystalline sp2-hybridized LIG (Fig. 13(b)). Direct photothermal conversion of PI and cellulose paper into PI-LIG and paper-LIG yielded the positive and negative triboelectric electrodes of the TENG.21 The PI-LIG-based TENG exhibited a peak voltage of ∼625 V, a current density of ∼20 mA m−2, a transferred charge density of ∼138 μC m−2, and a maximum power output of ∼2.25 W; the corresponding values for an Al-PI-based TENG were 400 V, ∼10 mA m−2, ∼85 μC, and 0.9 W m−2. The LIG electrode exhibited excellent stability, with an output change of <5.0% after 12000 cycles. Kelvin probe force microscopy revealed that the enhanced (∼150%) power density of the LIG-based TENG was attributable to a reduction in the electron-transfer barrier through alignment of the Fermi level. This increased the surface charge and lowered the interfacial barrier (by roughly six orders of magnitude) of the LIG-based TENG, compared with a TENG involving viscous Al electrodes. Therefore, high-performance TENGs for energy harvesting can be achieved by lowering the interfacial potential between dielectric and conductive layers.


3.3.2. Humidity-resistance of WDCM-based TENGs. 
High ambient humidity reduces TENG electrical outputs because water molecules adsorbed onto contact surfaces increase surface conductivity, compromising the formation of triboelectric surface charges. Hwang et al. used carbon electrodes with flat surfaces (F-CE) or carbon micropillars (M-CE), along with carbon nanofibers (N-CE), as conductive layers when preparing TENGs (Fig. 14(a)). The N-CE TENG was optimal; maximum voltage was 77.7 V, the maximum current was 27.2 μA, and maximum power was 0.34 mW cm−2. TENGs with carbon electrodes are more robust to humidity and mechanical friction, compared with TENGs that exhibit Al, Au, or Cu conductive layers.116 (Fig. 14(b)) shows that when the relative humidity increased from 20% to 85%, the open-circuit voltages of TENGs with carbon electrodes decreased by only 50%; the open-circuit voltages of TENGs with metal electrodes (Al, Au, and Cu) decreased by approximately 80% because the surface microstructures of WDCM electrodes are highly hydrophobic (Fig. 14(c)).

(d) Carbonized material-doped composite polymer film acts as a dielectric layer for TENG and its performance output117 (copyright 2022 Elsevier). 
Park et al. showed that metal–organic framework-derived cobalt-based nanoporous carbon composite nanofibers combined with polyvinylidene fluoride yielded a highly electronegative friction material that improved TENG performance (Fig. 14(d)). The large surface area and excellent nanoporosity considerably improved the electroactive β-phase formation and dielectric constant of polyvinylidene fluoride composite nanofibers, in conjunction with four- and nine-fold increases in surface potential and charge-trapping ability, respectively.117 A cobalt-based nanoporous carbon/polyvinylidene fluoride-based TENG exhibited an excellent power density (19.24 W m−2) and excellent output performance at 95% relative humidity. The output was stable over >60000 cycles. That study was the first to use carbonized metal–organic framework nanomaterials to prepare TENGs; it also confirmed that increases in the surface charge density of the dielectric layer led to improved TENG performance. Thus, carbonized electrodes can serve as alternatives to conventional metal electrodes, considering the significantly better moisture resistance of TENGs with carbonized electrodes.


3.3.3. Flexibility of WDCM-based TENGs. 
LIG constitutes a class of triboelectric materials that can be prepared from natural and synthetic carbon sources (Fig. 15(a)). Wang et al. used infrared laser irradiation to convert the surfaces of PI and cork into LIG (Fig. 15(b and c)).100 This approach produced a bilayer composite film that exhibited the high electrical conductivity associated with LIG and the triboelectric properties of the carbon sources. The LIG/PI composite was used to fabricate a metal-free flexible TENG (Fig. 15(d and e)) with an open-circuit voltage >3.5 kV (Fig. 15(f)) and peak power >8 mW (Fig. 15(g)). LIG was embedded into the PDMS matrix to form a single-electrode LIG/PDMS composite TENG. The single-electrode TENG was highly flexible and stretchable; the energy was generated via mechanical contact with the skin (Fig. 15(h)).

4. Applications of WDCM-based TENGs
4.1. Energy harvesting
WDCMs are used to manufacture TENGs that collect random mechanical energies such as the energy of human activity, as well as wind, sound, and wave energies from the environment; such energy is then converted into electrical energy. Tang et al. used loofah carbonization to prepare a three-dimensional film (i.e., a conductive layer) when developing a flexible, wearable noncontact double-layer TENG that collected the energy of human activity. When attached to a jacket, this TENG illuminated approximately 50 light-emitting diodes during hand tapping (Fig. 16(a)).18
 Fig. 16  Utilizing WDCM-based TENGs harvest energy from various systems. (a) TENG based on WDCM harvests mechanical energy from the human locomotion system18 (copyright 2023 Elsevier). (b) TENG based on WDCM harvests wind energy118 (copyright 2020 Elsevier). (c) TENG based on CF-CNT composite harvests sounds energy119 (copyright 2023 Elsevier). (d) TENG based on CB material harvests blue energy120 (copyright 2022 Elsevier). 
TENGs can harvest wind energy. Carbon electrodes were used to develop a flag-type TENG resistant to high humidity. When the wind blew from any direction, the flag fluttered; as the wind direction changed, various light-emitting diode banks became illuminated, the performance was excellent (Fig. 16(b)).118 At a matched load resistance of 5 MΩ and wind speed of 7.5 m s−1, the maximum current was 6.8 μA and the output power was 36.72 μW. The device could be used to collect energy in windy conditions.
Rani et al. used carbon fibers and CNT composites to manufacture innovative, naturally driven carbon fiber-CNT TENGs that convert noise into electricity (Fig. 16(c)).119 For the noise of 100–400 Hz, the voltage was 4.6 V and the current was 132 nA; thus, energy harvesting was excellent. Zaw et al. exploited the hydrophobicity of PDMS and the conductivity of carbon black to manufacture a highly corrosion-resistant liquid–solid TENG (i.e., MSLT) that directly harvested the mechanical energy of waves to generate electricity (Fig. 16(d)); MSLTs can be used for large-scale blue energy harvesting.120
4.2. Intelligent monitoring systems
WDCM-based TENGs are also widely used for intelligent monitoring of pressure, human–machine interfaces, and tactile signals. A hydrothermal method was used to extract saccharose and phytic acid from rice and sugar cane; phosphorus-doped mesoporous carbons were prepared using KIT-6 as a template, and a chair-mounted TENG was developed (Fig. 17(a)).121 The electrical energy generated when moving backward illuminated >20 green light-emitting diodes, reminding people to correct their sitting postures.
 Fig. 17  Application of TENG based on WDCM in intelligent monitoring systems. (a) WDCM-based TENG applied in biomechanical system121 (copyright 2022 American Chemical Society). (b) WDCM-based TENG applied in self-powered remote pressure monitoring system87 (copyright 2022 John Wiley and Sons). (c) WDCM-based TENG applied in intelligent life-saving tracking system122 (copyright 2019 Elsevier). 
A fully biobased TENG (i.e., F-TENG) was prepared by lignin fiber mat carbonization at high temperature (Fig. 17(b)).87 The device can produce a maximum voltage, current, and power of 232 V, 17 mA m−2, and 1.6 W m−2, respectively, which is enough to power electronic systems and is used to assemble smart packages. When the pressure was applied, a voltage was generated and a signal appeared. When the signal increased above a specific level, a warning was provided; when a set maximum voltage was exceeded, an “X” appeared to indicate that the package may be damaged. Ahmed et al. exploited the excellent thermal properties of carbonized aerogels to develop a FRTENG for operation under extreme conditions (Fig. 17(c)).122 The carbonization process enhances the mechanical properties of the aerogel, and imparts excellent triboelectric performance, generating 80 V and 25 μA m−2. Compared with the fire resistance of TENGs fabricated from conventional triboelectric materials, the fire resistance of the FRTENG was excellent; such TENGs could be integrated into the shoes and gloves of firefighters to wirelessly monitor their safety in hazardous situations. A FRTENG is thus a life-saving wearable.
Metal–organic framework materials have also been carbonized. ZiF-67 carbonization was used to generate cobalt-based nanoporous carbon for use in the manufacturing of the first noncontact double-layer TENG that was attached to robots to detect human movement. When a person approached, the robot moved away. Furthermore, sensors with noncontact double-layer TENGs were installed at the front and rear of a vehicle to prevent collisions.123
4.3. Self-powered combined systems
Electronic devices are increasingly miniaturized, leading to a growing demand for lightweight and sustainable power supplies. However, conventional batteries are large and limited in their use in specific spaces or applications. Xia et al. developed a TENG based on LIG and a rGO pressure sensor (Fig. 18(a)).25 LIG improves the transfer charge density of the sliding-freestanding mode TENG from 160 μC m−2 to 270 μC m−2. The TENG supplies power to the sensor, and any change in pressure alters the voltage at both ends; after signal processing, a voltage signal is sent to control a robot. Intelligent skin– and human–computer interactions are thus possible.

(b) The application of WDCM-based TENG in a self-cleaning self-charging device124 (copyright 2020 Elsevier). (c) The application of WDCM-based TENG in a self-charging power supply system125 (copyright 2017 Elsevier). 
TENG self-powered combined systems are widely used in the agricultural IoT (Fig. 18(b)) shows how LIG was used to prepare the surface of an integrated, flexible self-charging device through a one-step process, thereby creating a multimodal device known as ENGAGE (i.e., MTENG) with an all-solid-state micro-supercapacitor.124 The innovative application of a lotus leaf-like biomimetic structure and the one-step preparation of LIG electrodes considerably enhanced the device's self-cleaning ability, flexibility, and electrical output. Simulated rainfall with a flow rate of 50 mL s−1, the output voltage of MTENG with 6 V. After working for 40 min, MTENG can still maintain an output voltage of ∼4 V. The self-charging device can be installed on the surfaces of crop leaves to collect frictional energy caused by leaf vibrations and falling rain. This frictional energy is converted into electrical energy that is stored for later use.

Fig. 18(c) shows a self-charging power system that combines electro-spun paper-based triboelectric nanogenerators (EP-TENGs) as energy harvesters and supercapacitors as energy storage devices.125 Under motion frequency of 8 Hz, the VOC, ISC, QSC, and the maximum average power density of a single EP-TENG unit are ∼98.6 V, 11.3 μA, ∼31.1 nC, and 18.4 mW m−2, respectively. The system is very portable, adaptable, and stable.126,127 This TENG could be used to develop the next generation of wearable/portable electronic devices.
As mentioned above, we divide WDCM-based TENG into three categories according to energy harvesting, intelligent monitoring systems, and self-powered combined systems, respectively. Table 2 systematically presents the device performance of these WDCM-based TENG from the aspects of carbon source, carbonization method, carbonization material, TENG working mode and main device parameters.

TENGs are structurally diverse, efficiently convert energy, and are portable, they have been used in wearable devices, the IoT, and self-powered and blue energy. TENGs based on WDCMs exhibit high performance, humidity resistance, and flexibility. Thus far, we have summarized progress in the fabrication and use of WDCM-based TENGs. Additionally, we discussed how a TENG operates, methods for the preparation of WDCMs and the properties of those WDCMs, the advantages of WDCM-based TENGs, and the applications of such TENGs in energy harvesting, intelligent monitoring systems, and self-powered combined systems. In conclusion, WDCM-based TENGs are more efficient and less expensive to produce than other TENGs; they will substantially contribute to the promotion and widespread implementation of TENGs.
Additionally, to facilitate readers to understand WDCM-based TENG more systematically, we list Table 3 to provide some classic published reviews and books, which cover WDCM-based TENG in terms of materials, methods, principles, applications, etc.

5.2. Perspectives

5.2.1. Solid–liquid TENGs based on WDCMs. 
In 2014, it was first reported that raindrop energy could be harvested via triboelectrification. TENGs were thus considered for use in large-scale energy harvesting from water motions such as raindrops and ocean waves. The energy conversion efficiency of solid–liquid TENGs has increased from the 0.01% to 11.8%, and the power density currently exceeds 162 W m−2. The commercialization of solid–liquid TENGs appears likely. Such TENGs require hydrophobic materials to ensure electron transfer during solid–liquid friction and to avoid liquid residues that reduce the charge densities of solid surfaces. Considering their excellent hydrophobic properties, carbon-based TENGs have been used to harvest solid–liquid friction energy, although few such TENGs have been based on WDCMs. However, because conventional carbon materials and WDCMs are very similar in terms of physical, chemical, and mechanical properties, and because WDCMs exhibit excellent hydrophobicity, we believe that WDCMs hold great potential for use in solid–liquid TENGs.


5.2.2. Temperature-difference TENGs based on WDCMs. 
TENGs must function at room temperature and at high temperatures, such as when harvesting the vibration energy of a car engine. However, high temperatures reduce TENG output performance because of the thermionic emission effect.146,147 In recent years, this effect has been extensively studied. Li et al. used atomic force microscopy to extensively study the electron transfer between TENG friction layers; they found that the temperature difference triggered electron migration from the high-temperature side of the friction layer to the low-temperature side, thereby increasing the interface charge density.148 However, under continuous friction, the temperature of the low-temperature side gradually increased, inhibiting any further increase in the charge density. Qin et al. improved TENG output performance by creating a temperature difference; the voltage, current, surface charge, and output power increased by 2.7-, 2.2-, 3.0-, and 2.9-fold, respectively.149 Notably, the output performance of the TENG was positively correlated with the thermal conductivity of the friction layer.
WDCMs are considered good thermal conductors. For example, the K values of CNTs at the room temperature range from 1100 to 10000 W mK−1; the K values of single- and multi-walled CNTs are ∼3500 and ∼3000 W mK−1, respectively.150–152 The K value of graphene at room temperature is 1500 to 5300 W mK−1, and the maximum theoretical value can reach 10000 W mK−1.153–155 Considering these extremely high K values, WDCMs have been used as dopants that enhance the thermal conductivities of many polymers. In TENGs, enhancement of the thermal conductivity of the dielectric layer helps to suppress the thermal electron emission effect and enhance the interface charge density. Furthermore, as mentioned in Section 3.3.1, WDCMs have been used to dope the dielectric layer, thereby increasing the interface charge density. When these two effects are combined, WDCMs offer major advantages for the fabrication of temperature-difference TENGs.


5.2.3. Implantable TENGs based on WDCMs. 
Implantable devices play an important role in healthcare.156 Limited by battery life, traditional implantable devices cannot achieve long-term in situ monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment. The proposal and rapid development of TENG have freed implantable devices from the shackles of batteries, giving birth to self-powered healthcare systems. Biomechanical energy generated during all human motions, including blood circulation, heart/lung contraction, and relaxation, has been verified to be converted into electrical energy through TENG.157 However, the complex environment in biological systems poses severe restrictions on implantable TENGs. Given that the WDCM-based TENG exhibits high electrical output, humidity resistance, and flexibility, it indicates its potential application in implantable devices.
