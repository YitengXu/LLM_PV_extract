    , Accepted 7th June 2023First published on 8th June 2023AbstractPolymerization of small molecule acceptors (SMAs) has been proved to be an effective strategy to design polymer acceptors, in which the polymerization reaction is conducted via the coupling between the end groups of SMAs and linkers. However, polymer acceptors synthesized in this polymerization way cannot remain the favored packing modes of end groups in the original SMAs. Herein, we propose a strategy for designing polymer acceptors with grafted SMA units via the polymerization between central building blocks of SMAs and linkers. Polymer acceptors designed using this strategy can not only free the end groups to facilitate effective packing similar to SMAs but also form extended conjugation and double charge transport channels. With this strategy, a polymer acceptor SH-1 was synthesized, which shows more compact and ordered intermolecular packing in both neat and blended films compared with the corresponding SH-2 synthesized by conventional copolymerization via end groups and linkers. The all-polymer solar cells based on PM6:SH-1 showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14.14%, substantially higher than that of the PM6:SH-2 based device with an efficiency of 6.55%. This work provides a new strategy for designing polymer acceptors with great potential through further careful regulation of both main building blocks and linker groups.
1. Introduction
In the past decades, organic solar cells (OSCs) have made great progress through intensive efforts in material design, device optimization and mechanism investigation.1–8 Recently, benefiting from the emergence of the acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type small-molecule acceptors (SMAs),9 particularly the Y-series acceptors, OSCs based on polymer donors and SMAs have realized power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 19%.10–15 In comparison with SMA-based OSCs, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) with polymers as both donors and acceptors have their unique merits, e.g., good thermal and morphological stability, excellent stretchability and mechanical durability.16–19 Currently, PCEs exceeding 18% have been achieved for all-PSCs8,20–24 mainly attributed to the innovation of polymer acceptor materials, especially polymer acceptors designed with the SMA-polymerization strategy proposed by Li et al.18,25 To date, SMA-polymerization has proved to be an effective and successful strategy to design polymer acceptors and the majority of high-performance polymer acceptors are constructed by polymerizing A–D–A type acceptors such as ITIC and Y-series SMAs.21,26–30 However, as shown in Fig. 1a, the polymerization reaction sites in the above reported polymer acceptors are all located at the electron-deficient end groups. Polymer acceptors copolymerized via the end groups of SMAs and linkers might have several inherent issues. (1) Decreased intermolecular packing interaction: the intermolecular packing between electron withdrawing end groups has proved to be an essential and crucial packing mode in non-fullerene SMAs, which benefits the formation of efficient charge transport channels.31–33 However, after polymerizing with other linkers, the packing mode of the end groups in the original SMAs will be significantly changed. Especially, in many cases, the skeleton planarity of the polymer acceptors cannot be ensured owing to the twist conformation between the end groups of SMAs and the linker units, which will also be unfavourable for the intermolecular packing and corresponding device photovoltaic performances.26,34 (2) Reduced electron-deficient property of the end groups: with the polymerization between the end groups and linkers, the electron-deficient property of the end groups in the initial SMAs will be firstly changed after polymerization since one of the chemical modification sites with halogen atoms will be occupied to connect the end groups and linkers. Therefore, there is less chance to tune the property of polymer acceptors. (3) Regional isomerism problems:25,35 in the polymerization strategy via the end groups, brominated 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) is the essential unit. However, the brominated IC unit is usually a mixture of two isomers with similar polarities, which is difficult to purify and leads to different configurations of the target polymer acceptors.25

To address the above issue, based on the polymerization SMA strategy, herein, we propose an alternative approach for designing polymer acceptors with grafted small molecule acceptor units (Fig. 1a). The rationale is as follows: (1) freeing the end groups of SMAs to facilitate the end group packing, which will be beneficial for electron transport; (2) formation of extended conjugation and double charge transport channels; (3) enriching the chemical modification sites and giving more chance to fine tune the optical and electrochemical properties of polymer acceptors. Following the above strategy, we designed and synthesized a polymer acceptor named SH-1 with grafted SMA units. For comparison, a corresponding polymer acceptor SH-2 was synthesized following the conventional polymerization way through the end groups and linkers. With PM6 as the donor polymer, SH-1-based all-PSC achieved a PCE of 14.14%, much better than that of the SH-2-based device with an efficiency of 6.55%. This work provides an alternative pathway to construct polymer acceptors based on the polymerization SMA strategy, demonstrating great potential for achieving higher efficiency all-PSCs through the delicate design of both SMA building blocks and linker groups.
2. Results and discussion
The synthetic routes of SH-1 and SH-2 are displayed in Scheme S1,† and the detailed synthesis procedures are provided in the ESI.† The average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of SH-1 are 14.8 kDa and 1.46, respectively. SH-2 gave a similar Mn of 15.2 kDa and a broader polydispersity index of 1.97 (Fig. S1†). The UV-vis absorption spectra of SH-1 and SH-2 are shown in Fig. 2a. In CF solution, SH-1 and SH-2 show the maximum absorption (λmax) peaks located at 778 and 792 nm, respectively. The blue shifted absorption of SH-1 mainly comes from its weaker intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). Compared with their solution absorptions, the as-cast solid films of SH-1 and SH-2 display red-shifted peak absorptions by 12 and 8 nm, respectively, indicating a stronger aggregation tendency in the solid film for polymer acceptor SH-1 with the grafted SMA unit. The optical bandgaps (Egopt) calculated from the thin-film absorption edges of SH-1 and SH-2 are 1.45 and 1.38 eV, respectively. Furthermore, the temperature-dependent absorption spectra of the two polymer acceptors are studied. As shown in Fig. 1b and c, SH-1 shows a smaller blue shifting of absorption peaks (∼7 nm) than SH-2 (∼10 nm) with increasing the temperature from 10 to 100 °C, suggesting that SH-1 exhibits more compact intermolecular stacking. The energy levels of the two acceptor films were investigated by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV). From the onset reduction and oxidation potentials of the CV curves (Fig. S2†), the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO) energy levels were estimated to be −5.68 and −3.69 eV for SH-1, −5.64 and −3.76 eV for SH-2 (Fig. 2d, Table 1). Compared with SH-2, SH-1 has a lower HOMO level, higher LUMO level and thus slightly increased bandgap.

With the matched energy levels and complementary absorptions with the two polymer acceptors, the wide-bandgap polymer PM6 was selected as the donor to fabricate all-PSCs using the device structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/PNDIT-F3N/Ag (Fig. 3a). The details of device fabrication are presented in the ESI† and the detailed device data are listed in Tables S1–S4.† The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices are illustrated in Fig. 3b, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The optimal PM6:SH-1-based device achieved a PCE of 14.13% with a Voc of 0.979 V, a Jsc of 21.03 mA cm−2, and an FF of 68.67%. In contrast, the optimal device of PM6:SH-2 showed a PCE of 6.55% with a Voc of 0.908 V, a Jsc of 12.87 mA cm−2, and an FF of 55.94%. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the two devices are illustrated in Fig. 3c. The PM6:SH-1-based all-PSC exhibits substantially higher EQE compared with PM6:SH-2, thereby achieving a much larger integrated current density of 20.50 mA cm−2 for PM6:SH-1 than that of PM6:SH-2 with a value of 12.63 mA cm−2.

To clarify the variation of photovoltaic parameters of the two all-PSCs, the properties of the charge transport, exciton dissociation and charge generation of the two devices were investigated. The charge mobilities of the two blend films were studied using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method.36 As shown in Fig. 4a, the PM6:SH-1-based device exhibits higher electron/hole mobilities (2.16 × 10−4/2.93 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1) compared with the PM6:SH-2-based device (1.46 × 10−4/1.88 × 10−4 cm−2 V−1 s−1). The enhanced μh and μe are beneficial to promote charge transport and contribute to the higher FF and Jsc of the PM6:SH-1-based device. Furthermore, in order to investigate the exciton dissociation and charge generation properties, the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) was measured for the two devices (Fig. 4b). The exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) is calculated from Jph under the short-circuit condition divided by the saturated photocurrent density (Jsat).37 The PM6:SH-1-based device shows a Pdiss of 88.7%, which is much higher than the PM6:SH-2-based device (54.6%), demonstrating the highly efficient exciton dissociation in the device based on PM6:SH-1. To study the behaviour of charge recombination of the two devices, we measured the Jsc and Voc of solar cells by varying the light-intensity (Plight). As shown in Fig. 4c, the plots of Plightversus Jsc (Jsc ∝ Pα, where the exponent α being close to 1 reflects weak bimolecular recombination38–42) were measured to be 0.975 and 0.894 for PM6:SH-1 and PM6:SH-2-based devices, respectively. In view that the two devices had a similar μh/μe ratio of 1.35 and 1.29, the above α value results indicate that the PM6:SH-1-based device exhibited a weaker bimolecular recombination and suppressed recombination compared with those of the PM6:SH-2-based device.43Fig. 4d shows the relationship between the light intensity and Voc. The slope of Vocversus the natural logarithm of Plight can reflect the types of charge recombination in the device.44 The slope is calculated to be 1.229kT/q and 1.502kT/q for PM6:SH-1 and PM6:SH-2-based devices, indicating that the PM6:SH-1-based device had less bulk and surface trap-assisted recombination than the PM6:SH-2-based device.45,46

As it is known, the charge transfer/transport processes and photovoltaic performances are closely related to the morphology of active layer blend films. Therefore, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to visualize the surface morphologies of PM6:SH-1 and PM6:SH-2 blend films. As illustrated in Fig. 5, the two blend films show clearly different morphologies. The root-mean-square roughness (Rq) values are 3.65 and 10.2 nm for PM6:SH-1 and PM6:SH-2 blend films, respectively. Compared with the SH-2-based blend film, the PM6:SH-1 film gives a much smoother surface morphology. Moreover, the PM6:SH-1 blend film has a more featured interpenetrating structure, which is favourable for the exciton separation and charge transport. In contrast, the PM6:SH-2 blend film is more inclined to aggregate and results in a large phase separation. The neat films of SH-1 and SH-2 are also investigated (Fig. S3†). The SH-2 film also shows a rough surface distinguishing from the smooth film of SH-1, which is consistent with the blend film results.

Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was used to further investigate the impact of the molecular packing motifs and microstructure for the two acceptors. Compared with SH-2, SH-1 neat film shows intense π–π stacking with a distance of 3.86 Å (Fig. S4, Table S5†), demonstrating that the polymer acceptor SH-1 with the grafted SMA unit favours the intermolecular packing. As shown in Fig. 5c and f, PM6:SH-1 and PM6:SH-2 blend films all show the clear stacking peaks in the out of plane (OOP) direction, indicating the face-on dominant orientations. In comparison with the neat films, the two blend films exhibit enhanced and shifted (010) peaks at 1.67 Å−1 with a d spacing of 3.76 Å for the PM6:SH-1 blend film and 1.65 Å−1 with a d spacing of 3.81 Å for the PM6:SH-2 blend film (Table S5†). As listed in Table S6,† the crystal coherence length (CCL) of the PM6:SH-1 film is 34.48 Å, larger than that of the PM6:SH-2 film (28.56 Å), suggesting the more ordered molecular packing for the PM6:SH-1 film.47 The more compact intermolecular stacking of PM6:SH-1 should be attributed to its more planar conjugated backbone and the efficient packing of the end groups, which is beneficial for charge transport in the photovoltaic devices, consistent with the SCLC and AFM results.48
Notably, the devices based on PM6:SH-1 and PM6:SH-2 both show high Voc (>0.9 V), especially PM6:SH-1. To investigate the reason behind it, the detailed Eloss analysis was conducted. The Eloss of the devices were calculated to be 0.522 eV (PM6:SH-1) and 0.529 eV (PM6:SH-2) following the equation:49Eloss = Egap − qVoc
The Egap used in the equation was estimated by the intersections between the absorption and emission (Fig. S5†). Next, based on the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) theory, the detailed Eloss components were investigated.50 According to this theory, the Eloss can be divided into three parts: Eloss = ΔE1 + ΔE2 + ΔE3, where ΔE1 is the radiative recombination loss above the bandgap, ΔE2 is the radiative recombination loss below the bandgap,51 ΔE3 is the nonradiative energy loss. As summarized in Table 3, the devices show similar ΔE1 value of 0.269 eV and 0.265 eV calculated from the equation as follows:ΔE1 = Egap − qVSQOC

The value of ΔE1 is comparable with other typical OSCs. Calculated from the Fourier transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS) and EL spectroscopy, the device gave the VradOC value and then we can achieve the ΔE2 following the equation:ΔE2 = qVSQOC − qVradOC
The third part ΔE3, also named non-radiative combination energy loss, is calculated from the EQEEL (Fig. S6†) following the equation:52ΔE3 = −kTlnEQEEL
Clearly, both devices exhibit low Eloss, comparable with the high-efficiency state of the art devices. The limit of ΔE3 in OSCs is reported to be defined by the photoluminescence efficiencies of the low band gap component, i.e., the acceptor in the active layer for the typical non-fullerene based OSCs.53 As shown in Fig. S7,† the neat film of SH-1 demonstrates a photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 5.67%, higher than that of SH-2 with the value of 5.44% (Fig. S8†). The high PLQY of SH-1 might originate from their enhanced J-aggregation in the solid films, which has proved to favor high luminescence efficiencies.54 As a result, the PM6:SH-1-based device gives a slightly lower Eloss than the PM6:SH-2-based device primarily due to its lower ΔE3.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we have proposed a strategy for designing polymer acceptors with grafted SMA units via the polymerization through central building blocks of SMAs and linkers. This design strategy can not only free the end groups to facilitate the effective end group packing similar to SMAs but also favor extended conjugation and double charge transport channel, which can enhance π–π interactions and facilitate charge transport. With this strategy, the obtained polymer acceptor SH-1 exhibits more compact and ordered intermolecular packing in both neat and blended films compared with SH-2 synthesized by copolymerizing via SMA end groups and linkers. With more efficient exciton dissociation, facilitated charge transport, and suppressed recombination, the all-PSC device based on PM6:SH-1 showed a PCE over 14%, substantially higher than that of the PM6:SH-2 based device with an efficiency of 6.55%. These results indicate that the design strategy of polymer acceptors with grafted small molecule acceptors is an efficient way to construct high performance all PSCs. It is believed that higher efficiency polymer acceptors can be designed using the above strategy through the delicate regulation of both the central building block and linker groups.
