    , Accepted 5th January 2014First published on 6th January 2014AbstractIn this work, solvent chloronaphthalene (CN) and polymer acceptor an alternating copolymer of perylene diimide and carbazole (PCPDI) were utilized as co-additives to optimize the nanoscale phase-separated morphology and photovoltaic properties of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells based on the poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT)/N,N′-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (EP-PDI) system. The domain size of EP-PDI molecules together with that of P3HT distinctly decreased by adding a 0.75 vol% CN additive. The optimized lateral phase separation increased the donor–acceptor interfacial area and facilitated the exciton dissociation process, leading to 5-fold enhancement of short-circuit current (JSC). Furthermore, when PCPDI was employed as a co-additive, acceptor materials (including PCPDI and EP-PDI) were prone to aggregation towards the top surface of blend films, improving vertical phase separation of active layers. PCPDI incorporation, which improved the percolation pathways for electron carriers, suppressed the crystallinity of P3HT distinctly. Thus, much more balanced charge transport was achieved by PCPDI addition, which resulted in almost 1-fold enhancement of open-circuit voltage (VOC) by reducing nongeminate recombination. As a consequence, cooperative effects of CN and PCPDI additives improved the nanoscale phase-separated morphology in lateral and vertical directions simultaneously, achieving the enhancement in both VOC and JSC.
Introduction
In the field of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, there is no doubt that fullerenes and fullerene derivatives play a dominant role as acceptor materials. Extensive research has been focused on the development of polymer photovoltaic devices using fullerene or fullerene derivatives as acceptors and the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of around 8% for single BHJ devices has been reported.1–4 However, considering the inherently low lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of fullerenes compared with those of common donor materials, many research efforts have been focused on the development of nonfullerene small-molecule acceptors.5–7 By contrast, nonfullerene small molecules exhibit unique advantages, including tunable energy levels, good light absorption and enhanced device stability. To date, several kinds of small molecule nonfullerene acceptors designed have demonstrated PCEs close to those achieved with fullerenes.8–11
Among various nonfullerene small molecules, perylene diimide derivatives (PDIs) are attractive alternatives as acceptor materials.12 PDIs usually exhibit large molar absorption coefficients, photochemical stability and high electron mobility along the one-dimensional π–π stacking direction.13,14 In the active layer of OPV devices, the formation of interconnected phase-separated domains structured on the sub-20 nm length-scale is a requirement for the efficient charge separation and collection process. In addition, the crystallinity, the crystallite size and molecular orientation are also important factors to achieve exciton dissociation and carrier transport efficiently.15 Unfortunately, for PDI-based systems, the large-scale phase separation induced by the strong crystallinity of traditional PDIs seriously limits exciton dissociation for conjugated polymer–PDI blend systems.16–18 What's more, the decreased donor–acceptor interfacial area also induces the formation of a stable intermolecular state which is considered as an important loss mechanism for excitons generated in PDIs.19 Besides, efficient intermolecular stacking between PDIs is crucial for the charge transport process. However, compared with three-dimensional charge transport for fullerene-based systems, charge transport with high mobility in PDI crystals can be achieved only in the π–π stacking direction.20 The one-dimensional charge transport channel for PDIs will adversely impact electron-transport properties. To solve these issues existing in PDI-based systems, a variety of PDI-based molecules are designed to destroy planarity of PDIs by appropriately tuning the molecular architecture. The design of the PDI derivative by alkylation at the 2,5,8,11-positions of the PDI core21 and non-planar PDI by employing hydrazine to connect two PDI units16 effectively reduced the PDI aggregate size and achieved improved PCEs. Just recently the Yao group9 designed a dimeric PDI acceptor material which showed significantly reduced aggregation and achieved a promising PCE of 4.03%. Additionally, various physical approaches including control of annealing conditions22 and introduction of a compatibilizer17 also effectively restrained the domain size of PDI acceptor materials. However, in distinct contrast to fullerene-based systems,23 few systematic research studies on the close relationship between phase-separated morphology and performance based on the polymer–PDI system have been performed. Furthermore, all those methods including molecular design and physical approaches mentioned above are employed to merely manipulate the PDI domain size in order to obtain optimized lateral nanoscale phase separation. Actually, manipulation of vertical phase separation is of great importance to the improvement of polymer solar cell performance as well.24 There have been many reports on the vertical segregation of fullerene-based systems.25–27 It has been confirmed that the variation of vertical composition also plays a critical role in the aspects of the charge generation and extraction processes and heavily influences dissociation and recombination dynamics.27 However, the research in this aspect is even less mentioned for PDI-based OPVs. Besides, it is challenging to increase the open-circuit voltage (VOC) while maintaining or increasing the short-circuit current (JSC) at the same time merely by simple physical means.
In this work, we utilized poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) as donor material and the simplest PDI material N,N′-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (EP-PDI) as acceptor material to constitute PDI-based solar cells. The largest PCE for this system reported by now is not more than 0.25%.21,22 Instead of focusing our efforts on achieving a higher PCE value, we aim to establish the close correlation between phase separation morphology and electrical performance. Hence, the co-additive method was employed to optimize the nanoscale morphology and photovoltaic properties of BHJ polymer solar cells based on the P3HT–EP-PDI system. Conventional solvent additive chloronaphthalene (CN) was adopted to control nanoscale phase separation between P3HT and EP-PDI molecules. EP-PDI crystal size distinctly decreased from micron-sized aggregates to nanoscale structures via processing a 0.75 vol% CN additive. Another polymer acceptor additive an alternating copolymer of perylene diimide and carbazole (PCPDI) was adopted to tune vertical phase separation and achieve more balanced charge transport pathways. Acceptor materials were effectively induced to the top surface of blend films by PCPDI. Meanwhile, the crystallinity of P3HT was suppressed. By means of the co-additive (including CN and PCPDI) method not only lateral phase separation but also vertical phase separation were improved, leading to a simultaneous enhancement in both VOC and JSC.

Device fabrication and testing
Organic solar cells were fabricated on indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates pre-treated with water, acetone and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath followed by cleaning for 25 min with UV ozone. The poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer with a thickness of 25 nm was spin-coated on well-cleaned ITO substrates and dried at 140 °C in a vacuum for 10 min. A P3HT:EP-PDI (1:1 wt/wt, 20 mg mL−1) solution in CB was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer for 60 s in a glovebox to make an active layer of around 100 nm. For P3HT:EP-PDI:PCPDI ternary blend solutions with different weight ratios, the active layers were fabricated under the identical method. After spin-coating the active layer, the sample was transferred to the chamber immediately and the vacuum degree of the chamber was pumped down to less than 5.0 Pa by a mechanical pump in less than 5 min, and then pumped down to 10−4 Pa by a turbo pump and kept at this level for more than 12 h. Finally, a bilayer structure of Ca (30 nm)/Al (90 nm) was deposited on top of the active layer by thermal evaporation in a vacuum of 2 × 10−4 Pa to complete device fabrication. Four solar cells, each with an active area of 12 mm2, were fabricated per ITO glass substrate.
Characterization
The morphology of the active layer was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom force microscopy (AFM). TEM experiments were performed on a TEM-1011 (JEOL Co., Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. AFM experiments were carried out using Veeco Instruments Nanoscope in tapping mode. A silicon microcantilevel (spring constant 2 N m−1 and resonant frequency ≈70 kHz, Olympus, Japan) was used for the scanning. The crystallinity of the active layer was characterized by out-of-plane grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). For the GIXD studies, a diffractometer D8 Discover (Bruker, Germany) equipped with a copper target, +Göbel mirror (kα1 line, λ = 1.54 Å), a motorized reflectometry sample stage, and a multi-slit + scintillation detector was used. The out-of-plane grazing incident X-ray diffraction (uncoupled mode, incident angle at 0.20°) was measured at a step-scan rate of 0.05° per 5 s and the scattering angle 2θ ranging from 3 to 16°. SAED patterns were obtained using a JEOL JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Solid-state UV-vis absorption spectra for the active layers were recorded using a Lambda 750 spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA).
Surface composition of the active layers was characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS was carried out using ESCALAB 250 (Thermo electron Co., America). The source type of X-ray is Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV). The surface energy (γ) of P3HT, EP-PDI and PCPDI was determined from a geometric mean equation using the contact angles of deionized water and ethylene glycol. The contact angles were measured on a KRüSS DSA10-MK2 (KRüSS GmbH, Germany) drop shape analysis (DSA) system at an ambient temperature.
Current density–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the organic solar cells were measured using a computer controlled Keithley 236 source meter under AM1.5G illumination from a calibrated solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
Results and discussion
Solvent additive: optimizing lateral nanoscale phase separation and enhancing JSC
Since EP-PDI molecules tend to aggregate into micrometer-sized crystals, large-scale phase separation is always induced in PDI-based systems. In order to optimize the film morphology, solvent additive CN was employed for P3HT–EP-PDI blend solution. The morphology characters are extremely sensitive to the content of CN additive. The domain size of EP-PDI decreased from the order of micrometers to the order of nanometers when 0.75 vol% CN was adopted. Under these optimal conditions, the crystallite size of P3HT decreased as well. Thus, the improved nanoscale phase-separated morphology facilitated charge separation, resulting in a 5-fold increase of the JSC.
Different contents of the CN additive were employed for P3HT:EP-PDI (1:1 wt/wt) blend solution. The effect of CN is most clearly visualized by TEM images and AFM topographs (Fig. 1). The pristine P3HT:EP-PDI blend obtained without processing the CN additive shows large-scale phase separation. Micron-sized EP-PDI crystals can be seen distinctly (Fig. 1A and A′). Two incomplete diffraction rings in the SAED pattern also indicate the formation of EP-PDI ordered aggregates with large size in a limited area. P3HT:EP-PDI blend film processing from a solution containing 0.5 vol% CN still shows great phase-separated morphology, with domains of aggregated EP-PDI molecules on the scale of micron-size (Fig. 1B and B′). As the volume fraction of CN in solution increases to 0.75 vol% (Fig. 1C and C′), the size of EP-PDI aggregates dramatically decreases to a few hundred nanometers and the SAED patterns show two complete diffraction rings. The film roughness (see the cross-sectional height profiles in Fig. 1), which decreases from more than 24 nm to 3.35 nm after a certain amount of CN was employed, also reflects the improvement of phase-separated morphology. With the volume fraction of CN further increasing (more than 1.0 vol%, shown in Fig. 1D–F), micron-sized EP-PDI aggregates reappear (the film roughness increases to more than 20 nm again), followed by the appearance of incomplete diffraction rings in the SAED pattern. While the diffraction ring corresponding to the π–π stacking of P3HT (the d-spacing is around 3.8 Å) is always present in SAED patterns whether processing CN additive or not.

The insets of TEM images show the corresponding SAED patterns. The bottom panels show the typical cross-sectional height profiles of P3HT:EP-PDI blend films prepared under different conditions. 
To further study the effect of the CN additive on the crystallinity of the active layers, normalized absorption spectra and GIXD patterns were utilized for P3HT:EP-PDI (1:1 wt/wt) blend films prepared by using different concentrations of CN in CB solution. Unfortunately, the UV-vis absorption spectra for P3HT and EP-PDI are overlapped between 400 nm and 650 nm. What's even worse, the diffraction peaks corresponding to the (200) and (400) planes of EP-PDI are quite close to those of the (100) and (200) planes of P3HT.28 As a result, it will inevitably cause great trouble for the estimation of the crystallinity of a certain component based on absorption spectra or GIXD patterns of blend films (Fig. S1, ESI†). Since acetone which is a poor solvent for P3HT could dissolve EP-PDI to some extent, acetone-soaking treatment was employed to wash away the EP-PDI component before further characterization. After post-treatment, only the P3HT component was still retained in the film. The absorption spectra in Fig. 2a and b show that the intensity of the absorption peak near 610 nm corresponding to the 0–0 intermolecular transition in P3HT aggregates29 does not increase prominently until more than 1.0 vol% CN was used. In contrast, 0.5 vol% or 0.75 vol% CN additive even has a detrimental effect in the formation of P3HT ordered aggregates. Besides, the variation of the diffraction peak intensity with the concentration of CN additive in GIXD patterns shown in Fig. 2c also coincides with that discussed by the absorption spectra. Not only the crystallinity but also the crystallite size of P3HT change with the addition of CN. The peak at a diffraction angle (θ) of about 5.4° (2θ) reflects the (100) lattice plane of edge-on P3HT chains. The lamellar supramolecular structures are stacked along the a-axis shown in the inset of Fig. 2d. Since the half-width of the (100) peak is relevant to the Debye–Scherrer dimension of coherently scattering crystal domains, the P3HT crystallite size along the a-axis (La) can be estimated using the Scherrer equation.30–32Fig. 2d summarizes the (100) peak intensity and estimated La with different concentrations of CN. La, together with the crystallinity of P3HT, is reduced as a small amount of CN (0.75 vol%) was employed to the blend solution. Considering that the solubility of EP-PDI and P3HT molecules in CN solvent is much better than that in CB solvent, we consider that the CN additive will effectively facilitate the dispersion of EP-PDI molecules into the P3HT domain and thus inhibit the crystallization process of P3HT. That's why the size of EP-PDI domains greatly decreased as soon as a certain amount of CN was employed. While, when more than 1.0 vol% CN was utilized, the film formation time will become comparatively longer. Thus, the crystallization process of P3HT as well as EP-PDI as the driving force of phase separation prevails, resulting in even larger phase separation. Since both P3HT and EP-PDI are prone to crystallize, the driving force of phase separation will be much stronger than that of conjugated polymer–fullerene systems. Probably, this is an important reason that the optimum concentration of solvent additive (0.75 vol%) is far below the 2–3% optimum concentrations4,33–35 found in polymer–fullerene systems.

(d) Plots of the P3HT diffraction peak intensity and the crystallite size (La) corresponding to the (100) plane versus the concentration of CN. The inset illustrates the lamellar supramolecular structures formed by P3HT chains. 
In order to illustrate the close relationship between morphology and performance, we systemically investigated the photovoltaic properties of P3HT:EP-PDI (1:1 wt/wt) blend solar cells fabricated with different concentrations of CN. The solar cells have the basic device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:EP-PDI (1:1 wt/wt)/Ca/Al. The performances of these devices are outlined in Table 1 (the current density–voltage curves are shown in Fig. S2, ESI†). The use of a processing additive in fabricating devices leads to great improvement in performance. More specifically, the use of 0.75 vol% CN leads to enhancement of the photovoltaic efficiency of P3HT/EP-PDI (1:1 wt/wt) devices from 0.03% to 0.23% PCE. Meanwhile, the JSC of devices achieves dramatically 5-fold enhancement (from 0.26 mA cm−2 to 1.45 mA cm−2). The main reason for the enhanced performance is the sharp increase in JSC, which is induced by the optimized lateral phase-separated morphology. The decreased EP-PDI domains undoubtedly result in an increased donor–acceptor interfacial area, which not only facilitates the charge transfer process but also suppresses the formation of a stable intermolecular state, ultimately achieving improvement in charge separation.19 With the volume fraction of CN further increasing, the PCE decreases rapidly. When 1.25 vol% CN was used, the photovoltaic efficiency together with the JSC is even more disappointing than that of pristine film. We attribute the reduction of JSC to the coarsening of the phase-segregated morphology and the reduction in the total donor–acceptor interfacial area.

PDI-based polymer acceptor additive: controlling vertical phase separation and enhancing VOC
Recently, the addition of a third component to a binary fullerene-based system effectively achieved a tunable energy level and increased the VOC of OPVs.36–38 However, the study on the impact of a third component on the film morphology and device performance for nonfullerene-based systems shows an insufficiency. In this section, by introducing a polymer acceptor PCPDI, acceptor materials including EP-PDI and PCPDI are prone to aggregation towards the top surface, achieving optimized vertical phase separation. At the same time, the amorphous PCPDI polymers disrupted the intermolecular stacking of P3HT, leading to a great decrease of crystallinity. Much more balanced charge transport might effectively suppress a nongeminate charge recombination process. Thus, the VOC of the PDI-based system increased progressively after the third component was employed.
Considering the PDI-structure characteristic of PCPDI, PCPDI was employed to control the film morphology. The morphology characteristics of P3HT:EP-PDI:PCPDI ternary blend films with various blend ratios are shown in Fig. 3. With the amount of PCPDI increasing, the EP-PDI crystal size was reduced to some extent. Two diffraction rings corresponding to the lattice planes of EP-PDI even disappear when more than 30 wt% of PCPDI (P3HT:EP-PDI:PCPDI = 1:0.7:0.3, Fig. 3C) was utilized. Similar to EP-PDI, PCPDI as a third component would aggregate into micron-sized domains as well. With the further increase of the PCPDI amount, the domain size of PDI decreases distinctly. Meanwhile, the aggregates of PCPDI with hundreds of nanometers appear. That's why large scale phase separation reoccurs when much more PCPDI was employed (Fig. 3D, D′ and E, E′). To illustrate the effect of PCPDI on the crystallinity of P3HT and EP-PDI, PCPDI was mixed with P3HT and EP-PDI, respectively. GIXD patterns shown in Fig. 4a demonstrate that PCPDI has a negative influence on the crystallinity of P3HT as well as EP-PDI. When PCPDI as a third component was introduced to P3HT:EP-PDI blends, this negative effect on the crystallinity of P3HT and EP-PDI still exists (Fig. 4b). In addition, the intensity of the diffraction ring corresponding to π–π stacking of P3HT is reduced distinctly when more than 40 wt% of PCPDI was employed. The diffraction ring almost disappears when EP-PDI was completely replaced by PCPDI (Fig. 3E). Therefore, we conclude that a small amount of PCPDI additive will reduce the domain size of EP-PDI to some extent and at the same time restrain P3HT crystallization seriously.

The spin-coated films (A–E, A′–E′) were prepared by CB solution without a processing CN additive. The spin-coated film (F, F′) was prepared by using 0.75 vol% CN in CB solution. The insets of TEM images show the corresponding SAED patterns. The bottom panels show the typical cross-sectional height profiles of P3HT:EP-PDI:PCPDI blend films prepared under different conditions.

The manipulation of vertical phase separation is of great importance for the enhancement of polymer solar cell performance as well.39 As P3HT has a lower surface energy than EP-PDI (γP3HT: 26.35 mN m−1, γEP-PDI: 50.40 mN m−1, Table S1, ESI†), the gradient in the active layer usually shows a higher concentration of P3HT at the top surface of the active layers. While the PCPDI component which possesses comparatively low surface energy (γPCPDI: 25.01 mN m−1, Table S1, ESI†) is expected to move towards the top surface. To characterize donor–acceptor composition on the surface of the active layer, we conducted XPS measurements on the top surfaces of P3HT:EP-PDI:PCPDI blend films with various ternary blend ratios (Fig. 5a). In order to illustrate the alteration of donor–acceptor composition on the top surfaces vividly, the histogram of S(2p)/C(1s) and N(1s)/C(1s) peak area ratios is shown in Fig. 5b. Since the C(1s) peak represents the total content of the donor and the acceptor, S(2p)/C(1s) and N(1s)/C(1s) peak area ratios hence can be proportionally correlated to the donor and acceptor concentrations, respectively.24 With the content of PCPDI component increasing, the S(2p)/C(1s) peak area ratio decreases from 0.153 to 0.029. Meanwhile, the N(1s)/C(1s) peak area ratio increases from 0.022 to 0.065. When more than 40 wt% of PCPDI (P3HT:EP-PDI:PCPDI = 1:0.6:0.4) was doped, the peak area ratio of N(1s)/C(1s) is even higher than that of S(1s)/C(1s). All these phenomena demonstrate that the PCPDI component is prone to aggregation on the top surface of active layers. While, it seems contradictory that the peak area ratio of N(1s)/C(1s) suddenly fell to 0.017 when EP-PDI was completely replaced by PCPDI (Fig. 5b). Taking the nitrogen content of PCPDI into consideration, the sudden drop of N(1s)/C(1s) for P3HT:PCPDI blends is actually reasonable. Compared with EP-PDI, the nitrogen content of a PCPDI polymer chain is low. Thus, even PCPDI chains get the opportunity to the top surface of active layers, the signal of N(1s) detected by XPS is still limited. Nevertheless, the enhancement of the N(1s)/C(1s) peak area ratio for ternary systems indicates that the addition of PCPDI does exhibit apparent improvement in vertical phase separation. The only explanation for this variation is that EP-PDI molecules, together with the PCPDI component, are effectively induced to the top surface of active layers, achieving the manipulation of vertical phase separation.

The photovoltaic properties of ternary-blend BHJ organic solar cells based on P3HT:EP-PDI:PCPDI with different blend ratios are outlined in Table 2 (the current density–voltage curves are shown in Fig. S3, ESI†). Though the improvement of PCE for ternary-blend systems is limited (from 0.028% to 0.079%), the VOC changes noticeably by mixing the PCPDI component. The VOC of solar cells is improved by almost twofold (from 0.26 V to 0.52 V) when 20 wt% PCPDI (P3HT:EP-PDI:PCPDI = 1:0.8:0.2) was employed. With the further increase of the PCPDI component, the film roughness becomes even smaller and the phase-separated morphology seems much more optimized. Nevertheless, the device performance becomes distinctly poorer. We speculate that the aggregation of PCPDI itself induces the formation of trap sites (Fig. 3D, D′ and E, E′) and thus free charges can be easily trapped in these traps. What's more, the third component with an excess ratio may cause great negative influence on molecular arrangement of P3HT as well as that of EP-PDI. The performance of the P3HT:PCPDI blend (without EP-PDI) system was even too low to detect any signals. Even though, the VOC was always higher than 0.4 V provided the PCPDI component was used. As is well-known, the performance parameter VOC has always been correlated with the energy difference of the acceptor's lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and donor's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). However, the emphasis on electronic energy-level alignments tends to overshadow the potential effect of film morphology on the VOC. Coincidentally, the LUMO level of PCPDI (−3.80 eV) is quite close to that of EP-PDI (−3.84 eV) (calculated by cyclic voltammetry, Fig. S4, ESI†). Thus, the discussion of the enhanced VOC can be focused on the factor of film morphology. Actually, there are many reports on the regulation of VOC by modifying the donor–acceptor interface40–42 and vertical phase separation.43,44 We assume that the evolution of film microstructures may play a dominant role in the improved VOC for the PDI-based solar cells. The optimized vertical phase separation and alternative percolation pathways for electrons provided by PCPDI undoubtedly promote charge transport and charge collection processes. Thus, the charges generated at the donor–acceptor interface show much larger anisotropies in carrier mobility and the photocurrent losses due to the nongeminate recombination event should be reduced. The decreased nongeminate recombination which benefited from the optimized film microstructures maybe account for the higher VOC.45

Cooperative effects of co-additives: simultaneous optimization in lateral and vertical phase separation
As mentioned above, the CN additive effectively facilitated the enhancement of JSC. Meanwhile, the PCPDI component made a great contribution to the improvement of VOC. Then, what if both CN and PCPDI are employed for P3HT:EP-PDI blends? Intriguingly, cooperative effects of solvent and polymer acceptor co-additives effectively optimized lateral and vertical phase separation, leading to simultaneous enhancement in both VOC (0.50 V) and JSC (1.25 mA cm−2), shown in Fig. 6. A comparatively higher PCE of 0.26% (outlined in Table 2) was obtained via processing co-additives without further post-treatment.
 Fig. 6  Current density–voltage curves of P3HT:EP-PDI (1:1 wt/wt) blend solar cells fabricated without a CN additive (black line) and with 0.75 vol% CN (red line). Current density–voltage curves of P3HT:EP-PDI:PCPDI (1:0.8:0.2) ternary-blend solar cells fabricated without a CN additive (blue line) and with 0.75 vol% CN (green line). 
TEM and AFM images (Fig. 3F and F′) show the morphological characteristics of P3HT:EP-PDI:PCPDI (1:0.8:0.2) blend film prepared by using 0.75 vol% CN. Since both CN and PCPDI could effectively reduce the crystallization of EP-PDI molecules, a nanoscale phase-separated morphology with an increased area of interface and much more effective carrier transport pathways are formed via processing co-additives. Judging from the AFM image shown in Fig. 3F′, it is obvious that the domain size of EP-PDI has already decreased to tens of nanometers. The film roughness (around 2.85 nm) is even smaller than that of the film prepared by employing one type of additive. What's more, acceptor materials are prone to the top surface induced by the PCPDI component, achieving the manipulation of vertical phase separation. In fact, the addition of CN even has a positive influence on the optimized phase separation in the vertical direction for ternary blend films. Fig. 5b shows that the N(1s)/C(1s) peak area ratio increases from 0.032 to 0.053 after 0.75 vol% CN was employed for P3HT:EP-PDI:PCPDI (1:0.8:0.2) blend film. Thus, free charges generated at the donor–acceptor interface would be collected effectively due to charges being able to percolate into its preferential phase, where it has a direct transportation path to its collection electrode. Based on the above discussion, a schematic morphological model is proposed for the P3HT–EP-PDI system (Fig. 7). The introduced co-additives not only effectively reduce the EP-PDI aggregated domains, achieving optimized nanoscale lateral phase separation, but also induce acceptor materials to aggregate towards the interface of cathode, achieving optimized vertical phase separation. By comparing current density–voltage curves of four devices fabricated under different conditions shown in Fig. 6, it is obvious that CN and PCPDI still reflect their respective roles in improving device performance even when both of them were utilized. Due to the combined effects, we achieve great improvement of device performance by increasing the VOC and the JSC simultaneously. The final PCE of the device fabricated using co-additives reaches 0.26%.
 Fig. 7  The proposed schematic morphological model for the P3HT/EP-PDI active layers before and after co-additives (CN and PCPDI) being employed. The phase-separated morphology is greatly improved in the lateral and vertical directions when co-additives were employed. 
To further illustrate the influence of co-additives on carrier transport, the hole and electron mobilities in the blended films were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method46 with the device structures ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:EP-PDI (or P3HT:EP-PDI:PCPDI)/MoO3/Al (hole-only device) and Al/P3HT:EP-PDI (or P3HT:EP-PDI:PCPDI)/Ca/Al (electron-only device), respectively. The experimental dark current densities of hole-only and electron-only devices with or without co-additives in the P3HT:EP-PDI blend films are shown in Fig. 8. The calculated hole and electron mobilities of four devices based on different experimental conditions are listed in Table 3. Compared with the pristine P3HT/EP-PDI blend solar cell, the addition of CN which contributes to the development of a beneficial EP-PDI microstructure results in an improvement of electron transport from 1.05 × 10−7 to 5.52 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1. Meanwhile, the hole transport slightly decreases from 6.31 × 10−5 to 5.54 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which coincides with the decreased crystallinity of P3HT mentioned in the first section. Since PCPDI greatly suppresses the crystallinity of P3HT and EP-PDI, both hole and electron mobilities decrease distinctly as soon as the third component PCPDI was employed. However, the addition of co-additives, which adversely affect the hole mobility, still promotes the electron mobility from 1.05 × 10−7 to 3.49 × 10−7. In comparison to the hole mobility, carrier mobility of electrons is much lower in P3HT:EP-PDI pristine film, such an opposite trend induced by co-additives may achieve much more balanced charge transport. Since the PDI-based device performance is improved merely by modifying film microstructures via processing co-additives, there is still a huge distance to further promote the PCE of P3HT–EP-PDI systems. There may be potential for further improvement of the PCE by using a third component with a wider spectral coverage and a higher LUMO level.

Conclusions
In conclusion, by the co-additive method the nanoscale phase-separated morphology of P3HT–EP-PDI blend films was optimized and photovoltaic properties of BHJ organic solar cells were improved obviously. The optimized nanoscale phase separation developed in the lateral direction via processing the CN additive. The decreased domain size of the EP-PDI phase produced a much larger donor–acceptor interface, facilitating the exciton dissociation process. The optimized phase separation developed in the vertical direction via processing the PCPDI component. Acceptor materials including EP-PDI and PCPDI were prone to move towards the top surface of active layers. The improved vertical phase separation and an alternative charge pathway provided by the PCPDI facilitated electron transport process. The decreased crystallinity of P3HT induced by PCPDI had a negative influence on the hole transport. Nevertheless, much more balanced charge transport resulted in the reduction of nongeminate recombination. The nanoscale phase-separated morphology in lateral and vertical directions was optimized simultaneously via co-additives, achieving the enhancement in both VOC and JSC. Finally, a comparatively high PCE of 0.26% was obtained without further post-treatment.
