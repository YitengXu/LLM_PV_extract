    , Accepted 27th December 2018First published on 28th December 2018AbstractNon-toxic and air-stable silver bismuth iodide semiconductors are promising light absorber candidates for photovoltaic applications owing to a suitable band gap for multi- or single-junction solar cells. Recently, solution-based film fabrication approaches for several silver bismuth iodide stoichiometries have been investigated. The current work reports on a facile and reproducible two-step coevaporation/annealing approach to deposit compact and pinhole-free films of AgBi2I7, AgBiI4 and Ag2BiI5. X-ray diffraction (XRD) in combination with scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis reveals formation of pure cubic (Fdm) phase AgBi2I7, cubic (Fdm) or rhombohedra (Rm) phase AgBiI4, each with >3 μm average grain size, or the rhombohedral phase (Rm) Ag2BiI5 with >200 nm average grain size. A phase transition from rhombohedral to cubic structure is investigated via temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction (TD-XRD). Planar-junction photovoltaic (PV) devices are prepared based on the coevaporated rhombohedral AgBiI4 films, with titanium dioxide (TiO2) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as electron- and hole-transport layers, respectively. The best-performing device exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of as high as 0.9% with open-circuit voltage (VOC) > 0.8 V in the reverse scan direction (with significant hysteresis).
Introduction
Semiconductor lead-halide perovskites serve as high-performance absorber materials for thin-film solar cells, owing to their remarkable optical, electrical and chemical properties.1–7 Ease of solution-based processing coupled with inexpensive and earth-abundant constituents is expected to reduce production costs relative to commercial solar cells – e.g., silicon, CdTe, Cu(In,Ga) (S,Se)2 (CIGS) and GaAs.8 Despite the intense advancement in PCE of lead-halide perovskite solar cells (23.7%),9 environmental toxicity of Pb and low stability under ambient conditions remain two key issues hindering large-scale commercialization of this technology.10–13 The three-dimensional (3D) perovskite network with general formula ABX3 (A = CH3NH3, NH2CHNH2, Cs and Rb; B = Pb; X = Cl, Br and I) plays a key role in generating the outstanding properties and consists of corner-sharing [BX6] octahedra infiltrated by either an organic or inorganic monovalent cation A+. Although incorporation of inorganic A+ cations in place of the organic analogues has enhanced the stability of resulting devices,14,15 the demanded level of stability for large-scale commercialization still remains to be achieved. Tin and germanium (Sn2+, Ge2+) have been independently considered for the “B” site (to remove Pb), but are environmentally unstable owing to the propensity of these elements to oxidize to the 4+ valence state (Sn4+ and Ge4+).16–20 Recently, mixtures of Sn2+ and Ge2+ have been proposed to lead to moderate performance levels (up to 6.90%) and improved stability.21–23
Alternatively, lead-free light harvester materials can be realized by substituting Sn2+ with isoelectronic Sb3+, with a typical formula A3Sb2X9 (A = CH3NH3, K, Rb, Cs; X = Cl, Br, I).18,24–27 Despite low reported PCE of 0.08% for the (CH3NH3)3Sb2I9 solar cell,26 Zhou et al. has reported that chlorine incorporation promotes formation of the 2D layered structure (CH3NH3)3Sb2I9, yielding a PCE of over 2%.28 Recently, the efficiency of (CH3NH3)3Sb2I9 solar cells has reached up to 2.77% via controlling the crystallinity of the fabricated films through a combination of antisolvent treatment and insertion of a hydrophobic interlayer.25 Moreover, a recent report by Buonassisi et al. suggests that the highest PCE of 0.76% for Rb3Sb2I9 compared to the relatively poor PV performances of K3Sb2I9 (0.17%) and Cs3Sb2I9 (0.03%) originates from the large exciton binding energies and large carrier effective masses, especially in the latter materials.24 Low-toxicity and stable Bi3+ represents another candidate to replace Pb, offering similar ionic radius and identical electronic structure to Pb2+. However, direct incorporation of Bi is complicated (as for Sb) by its trivalent oxidation state (vs. divalent for Pb), as charge balance requirements induce structural changes to the perovskite lattice that substantially alter material properties when substituted for Pb (unless balanced by an equal amount of a monovalent cation, such as Ag+). Recently, several semiconductor Bi-based halides, including “defect perovskites” A3Bi2I9 (A = CH3NH3, NH4, K, Rb, Cs),29–35 “double perovskites” Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Br, Cl),36,37 CuBiI4 (ref. 38 and 39) and several stoichiometries of silver bismuth iodide (e.g. AgBiI4, AgBi2I7, Ag3BiI6),40–42 have been investigated as potential absorber materials for thin film solar cells. Among them, the silver bismuth iodides have the most suitable band gap (1.7–1.8 eV) for single junction devices.40,42,43
Silver bismuth iodide structures with general formula of AgxBiyIz, where z = x + 3y, consist of the formally monovalent Ag+ cation, trivalent Bi3+ cation and monovalent I− anion, in which [AgI6] and [BiI6] octahedra share edges. The cationic sublattice of these compounds involves disorder due to the partial occupancy of a single position by silver, bismuth or their respective vacancies, permitting the wide range of stoichiometries observed in literature. The edge-sharing octahedra arrange either in a rhombohedral CdCl2 layer-type structure, in which every other (111) plane is occupied with Ag+ or Bi3+, or a closely-related 3D-network defect-spinel cubic structure with vacant tetrahedral sites (Fig. 1e and f). Formation of each of these structures in a Ag–Bi–I compound evidently depends on several parameters including composition, annealing conditions and preparation methods.

All films were annealed at 180 °C for 15 min under BiI3 vapor, except the as-deposited film of r = 0.2 (180 °C for 15 min in N2). The as-deposited films index to a rhombohedral structure. Small peaks due to BiI3 and AgI impurities are marked with “*” and “+”, respectively. For r = 0.6 and 0.8 annealed films, all peaks index to the known cubic (e) and rhombohedral (f) structure types, respectively. Selected strong diffraction peaks are labeled for each structure type. Unit cell/fitting parameters are listed in Table S1.† 
Among the AgxBiyIx+3y compounds, Sargent and co-workers reported on thin film fabrication of cubic AgBi2I7 and proposed a crystal structure similar to ThZr2H7, in which both [AgI6] octahedra and [BiI8] hexahedra coexist in the crystal structure.40 However, Yan and co-workers argued that AgBi2I7 adopts a Ag-deficient AgBiI4-type structure.44 Further studies showed that Ag3BiI6 and AgBiI4 are additional prospective ternary compounds in the AgI–BiI3 phase diagram, in which Ag3BiI6 indexes to a rhombohedral unit cell (space group: Rm) with a = 4.3537(6) Å, c = 20.810(4) Å and Z = 1, whereas AgBiI4 crystallizes in the cubic space group Fdm with a = 12.223(1) Å and Z = 8.41,45 On the other hand, Rosseinsky et al. have reported both rhombohedral and cubic structures for AgBiI4, depending on the synthesis approach employed for growing this nominal stoichiometry.42 Although they have obtained a cubic structure (space group Fdm) with lattice parameters a = 12.2104(3) Å and a = 12.21446(4) Å, for AgBiI4 synthesized by a solution-based process and in powder (bulk) form, respectively, single-crystal AgBiI4 was indexed to a rhombohedral unit cell (Rm) with a = 4.3187(1) Å and c = 20.6004(8) Å. On the basis of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, they have reported similar stability levels for the defect-spinel cubic and CdCl2 layer-type structures. Another reported composition for the Ag–Bi–I system, Ag2BiI5, has the same crystal structure as Ag3BiI6 and crystallizes in the space group Rm with a = 4.350 Å and c = 20.820 Å.46 Moreover, Aramaki and co-workers have reported that increasing Bi-content of the Ag–Bi–I compound from Ag3BiI6 to AgBi2I7 causes an increase in the number of vacant sites in the cation sublattice. They also have proposed three possible crystallographic structures for AgBiI4 consisting of R3m (trigonal), C2/m (monoclinic), and Fd3m (cubic).43 Oldag et al. reported an activation energy of 0.44 eV for Ag migration in AgBiI4, which is similar to the activation energy of iodine migration of 0.48 eV in methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3), suggesting facile migration of Ag in this system.41,47
Based on the above studies, it is apparent that not only the target composition of the compound but also the synthesis pathway can have substantial influence on the formation of the final crystal systems. In most of these studies, solution-based approaches have been applied to grow thin films of silver bismuth iodide. Photovoltaic performance of solar cells with a mesoporous architecture and solution-processed AgBi2I7, Ag2BiI5, Ag3BiI6, Ag2Bi3I11 (cubic structure) and most recently AgBiI4 as absorber materials, have been reported with efficiencies of 1.22,40 2.1 (ref. 48) or 2.31 (ref. 49) or 2.62,50 4.3,43 0.78,51 and 2.2 (ref. 50) or 2.1%,52 respectively. To date, no report of the photovoltaic performance of vacuum-deposited silver bismuth iodide in a planar device structure has appeared in the literature. In the current study, a facile two-step deposition method consisting of coevaporation followed by post-deposition annealing is applied to fabricate polycrystalline films of silver bismuth iodide with various stoichiometries (e.g. AgBi2I7, AgBiI4, and Ag2BiI5). Depending on the composition, the thin film morphology changes from smooth, pin-hole-free and coarse grain (>3 μm diameter), to fine grain (<100 nm diameter) with increased pinhole density. A comprehensive structural study reveals that a crystallographic phase transition from rhombohedral to cubic occurs in Bi-rich ternary compounds due to compositional and other thermally-induced changes in the film. In contrast, Ag-rich films dominantly remain in the rhombohedral phase, independent of annealing. The compositional characteristics of the films are studied by SEM/EDX, and electronic properties of optimized films are characterized by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and inverse photoemission spectroscopy (IPES). PV devices with planar structure based on rhombohedral AgBiI4 exhibit a power conversion efficiency of as high as 0.9% (reverse scan direction), with open circuit voltage of >0.8 V and a short circuit current density of ∼2 mA cm−2. Substantial hysteresis in the devices points to barriers to charge extraction or defects in the current device configuration.
Experimental
Thin film growth
Thin films of silver bismuth iodide (thickness ≈ 450 nm) were grown by a dual-source coevaporation approach using alumina Radak sources in an Angstrom Engineering (EvoVac) thermal evaporator. The two Radak sources were filled with BiI3 (99.999%, Alfa Aesar) and AgI (99.9%, Alfa Aesar) powders. To examine possible changes in the stoichiometry of the final films, various deposition rate ratios for the two precursors—i.e. r = rate(AgI)/rate(BiI3) = 0.2, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.2—were tested. Note that the specific rate ratios used do not, in general, translate to the same elemental ratios in the final films, due to different volatilities, evaporation and sticking properties for the two metal halides. Nevertheless, there is the expectation that changes in r will correlate with changes in resulting film composition. The base pressure for the evaporation was below 2 × 10−6 Torr. During the deposition, no intentional substrate heating was applied. Post-deposition annealing of the films was performed inside a nitrogen-filled glovebox. For this purpose, an as-deposited film was placed under a quartz cover in preheated BiI3 vapor for a specified period of time followed by quenching of the film to room temperature (r = 0.6, 0.8, 1.2). In addition, the as-deposited Bi-rich films (e.g. r = 0.2 and 0.6) were annealed at 180 °C for 15 min under N2 without an excess of BiI3 vapor. Annealing temperatures and times ranged over 150–200 °C and 10–30 min, respectively, for achieving single-phase and pinhole-free polycrystalline films. After testing various annealing conditions for the deposited films with different rate ratios, post-deposition annealing at 180 °C for 15 min (either with or without excess BiI3 vapor) was determined to be the optimal condition to achieve smooth and pinhole-free films with relatively large grain size.
Thin film characterization
XRD measurements were performed using a PANalytical Empyrean X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation with operating voltage/current of 45 kV/40 mA) under ambient conditions with a 10–60° 2θ scattering angle range. Pawley refinement was conducted using the PANalytical HighScore Plus software to determine lattice parameters. Crystallographic phase transitions were investigated by TD-XRD measurements using an Empyrean X-ray diffractometer with an Anton Paar XRK 900 reactor chamber. A continuous N2 flow with a flow rate of 20 ml min−1 was applied throughout the variable-temperature measurements. Surface morphology and film grain size were characterized using a FEI XL30 scanning electron microscope. Compositional measurements were carried out using EDX (FEI Verios 460L) with a beam current of 1.6 nA and beam voltage of 20 kV. Average film composition was characterized by collecting SEM/EDX spectra of three different areas of the deposited film. Thin films of AgI and BiI3 were used as EDX standards. Optoelectronic properties of the films were studied using optical absorption spectroscopy (Shimadzu UV3600 spectrometer) on films deposited on soda-lime glass substrates. Photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) measurements, including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), UPS and IPES, were conducted under ultra-high vacuum (10−10 mbar) on thin films deposited on indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates. The films were analyzed as-loaded to avoid any sputtering damage. For UPS and XPS studies, the analysis chamber was equipped with a hemispherical energy analyzer (Specs Phoibos 150). For XPS, Al Kα (1486.6 eV) and Mg Kα (1253.6 eV) sources were used. UPS measurements were carried out using a He I (hν = 21.22 eV) source. IPES measurements were performed in the isochromat mode using a homemade spectrometer located in the PES analysis chamber, with a resolution of approximately 0.6 eV as determined by the width of the Fermi edge of clean polycrystalline silver. The positions of the Fermi edge were used to align the UPS and IPES energy scales.
Device fabrication and characterization
A TiO2 solution was prepared by dissolving 2:1 (v/v) of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in isopropanol, Sigma Aldrich) in ethyl alcohol (anhydrous, ≥99.5%, Sigma Aldrich). Spray pyrolysis was used to fabricate a thin (30–50 nm) layer of compact TiO2 on fluorine-doped tin-oxide (FTO)-coated glass substrates (Kintec, sheet resistance = 10 Ω sq−1, glass thickness = 2.2 mm). During the spray coating, the substrate temperature was maintained at 450 °C using a hot plate. Deposition was followed by annealing of the substrates at 500 °C for 1 h. The TiO2-coated substrates were then transferred to the thermal evaporator (as described above), wherein a thin layer of silver bismuth iodide was deposited via coevaporation of AgI and BiI3 with r = 0.6. Subsequently, post-deposition annealing was carried out in nitrogen atmosphere at 180 °C for 15 min followed by a slow-cooling process. The hole transport material, P3HT (Solaris), was dissolved to a concentration of 20 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene (anhydrous, Sigma Aldrich) and the solution was deposited by spin-coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s on top of the annealed silver bismuth iodide films. Finally, 80 nm thick gold (Au) electrodes were deposited on top of the devices through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation at ∼10−6 Torr base pressure.
Current density–voltage (J–V) characterization of the planar solar cells was performed using an Oriel solar simulator and a Keithley source meter under 1 sun AM 1.5 G illumination, calibrated by a Si reference cell from Newport Corp. A mask with 0.1 cm2 aperture area was utilized to define the active area for each cell. An EQE spectrum was recorded using an Enlitech QE-R instrument, in AC mode with chopper frequency of 165 Hz, in the absence of bias voltage or illumination. Calibration was carried out using a certified silicon solar cell provided by Enlitech Company.
Results and discussion
Phase purity and unit cell parameters of the films grown in the present study were examined by XRD and average compositions were characterized using SEM/EDX, as a function of component metal halide mixing ratio during coevaporation (r = rate(AgI)/rate(BiI3); see the Experimental section for more details). The obtained XRD pattern for the as-deposited film of r = 0.2 matches a rhombohedral unit cell (Rm, no. 166) with lattice parameters a = b = 4.3502(3) Å, c = 20.693(2) Å (Fig. 1a left). Fitting the experimental XRD pattern for the annealed film of r = 0.2 (180 °C, 15 min under N2) yields a two-phase mixture of rhombohedral (Rm, no. 166) with a = b = 4.3479(4) Å, c = 20.641(2) Å and cubic (Fdm, no. 227) with a = b = c = 12.1944(4) Å (Fig. 1a right). BiI3 impurity peaks are also observed for both as-deposited and annealed films, likely originating from the large amounts of BiI3 applied during the coevaporation process. SEM/EDX measurements verify high average Bi content, yielding Ag0.49Bi2.13I7.00 and Ag0.72Bi2.07I7.00 for the as-deposited and annealed films, respectively. Given the mixed phase nature of the r = 0.2 films, they will not be further considered in this study.
The obtained XRD pattern for the r = 0.6 as-deposited film indexes to a rhombohedral unit cell with lattice parameters a = b = 4.3546(1) Å, c = 20.7430(3) Å in the Rm space group (Fig. 1b left). A crystallographic phase transition from rhombohedral to cubic structure occurs upon post-deposition annealing of the as-deposited film. This phase transition occurs regardless of whether the film is annealed under BiI3 vapor (Fig. 1b right) or only under N2 (Fig. S1a†). The XRD pattern of the annealed film without BiI3 yields a cubic structure (Fdm) with lattice parameters a = b = c = 12.2079(2) Å, with little difference noted compared to films annealed under excess of BiI3 vapor (a = b = c = 12.2043(3) Å) and with previously published reports for the similar film compositions prepared via solution-processing.41,42 The SEM/EDX analyses for the r = 0.6 as-deposited, annealed under BiI3 vapor, and annealed in N2 films yield average compositions of AgBi2.01I7.00, Ag1.20Bi1.85I7.00, and Ag1.12Bi1.04I4.00 (the first two close to AgBi2I7 and the last within experimental uncertainty of AgBiI4), respectively. Considering the error margins for SEM/EDX analysis, these results indicate that annealing in the absence of excess BiI3 vapor results in the removal of volatile BiI3 from the film, while maintaining the cubic structure. The average composition of the annealed film under BiI3 vapor slightly changes from AgBi2.01I7.00 to Ag1.20Bi1.85I7.00. The annealing process coupled with the still Bi-rich composition (despite the BiI3 loss during the post-deposition process) may account for the phase transition from the rhombohedral to the cubic structure. Clearly, a change in the film composition (e.g. AgBi2I7 to Ag1.20Bi1.85I7.00 or AgBiI4) upon annealing represents a crucial factor affecting the crystal structure of silver bismuth iodide.42 In addition, the effect of the cooling process on final crystal structure of the annealed Ag–Bi–I films (180 °C for 15 min under N2 atmosphere) deposited with r = 0.6 was investigated using XRD (Fig. S2†). For this purpose, the annealed films were either quenched or slow cooled (with an average ∼ −4 °C min−1 nominal ramp rate) to room temperature. Despite a crystallographic phase transition (from Rm to Fdm) observed for the post-deposition annealed Ag–Bi–I film (r = 0.6; under N2 and quenched) (Fig. S1†), the collected XRD pattern of the slow-cooled film (Fig. S2†) indexes to a rhombohedral unit cell (Rm). The SEM/EDX analysis for the slow-cooled film yields an average composition of Ag1.30Bi0.90I4.00. Apparently, this change in unit cell may be attributed to a slight deviation from the nominal AgBiI4 composition to a more Ag-rich Ag–Bi–I phase, due to further loss of volatile BiI3 during the slow-cooling process.
As-deposited and post-deposition annealed (180 °C for 15 min under BiI3 vapor) Ag-rich r = 0.8 films of silver bismuth iodide form in the rhombohedral crystal structure (Fig. 1c), with the lattice parameters a = b = 4.3479(1) Å, c = 20.8789(2) Å for the as-deposited film and a = b = 4.3481(1) Å, c = 20.8308(8) Å for the annealed film under BiI3 vapor. A small trace of AgI impurity was observed for the as-deposited film (Fig. 1c), which disappeared after post-deposition annealing under BiI3 vapor, verifying formation of the final Ag–Bi–I phase via annealing. Note that the estimated lattice parameters for the r = 0.8 annealed film for vacuum-deposited films are consistent with the reported solution-processed Ag2BiI5 values.48 SEM/EDX measurements show that the as-deposited and annealed films of r = 0.8 have average compositions of Ag1.62Bi1.06I5.00 and Ag1.85Bi1.03I5.00, respectively, corresponding to (perhaps Ag-poor) Ag2BiI5. Further increase in deposition rate ratio to r = 1.2 results in films with AgI impurity peaks in the XRD patterns for both as-deposited and annealed films (Fig. 1d) with average compositions of Ag1.96Bi0.95I5.00 and Ag1.91Bi0.97I5.00, respectively, consistent with the Ag2BiI5 composition. The resulting unit cells have rhombohedral structure with a = b = 4.3470(2) Å, c = 20.8617(9) Å for the as-deposited film and a = b = 4.3510(2) Å, c = 20.859(1) Å for the annealed film under BiI3 vapor.
The Pawley-refined unit cell parameters for the Ag–Bi–I films with different compositions are summarized in Table S1† along with the corresponding composition of each film obtained from SEM/EDX. Evidently, gradual increase of the AgI content in the coevaporated Ag–Bi–I films (from r = 0.2 to r = 1.2) results in the enlargement of the c lattice constant of the corresponding cells, yielding unit cells with expanded volumes for both rhombohedral and cubic cells. This enlargement of the unit cells presumably originates at least in part from the larger ionic radius of Ag+ (115 pm) relative to that of Bi3+ (103 pm). Existence of vacancies in the crystal structure of Ag–Bi–I permits the wide range of stoichiometries and unit cell size-tunability within the Ag–Bi–I crystals.
TD-XRD measurements were carried out to gain insight into the observed rhombohedral to cubic phase transition mechanism. Fig. 2 displays the contour plots of the collected XRD patterns from silver bismuth iodide films deposited with (a) r = 0.6 and (c) r = 0.8 in the 2θ range from 10°–28°, throughout the annealing and cooling processes under N2 atmosphere. The temperature profile shown in Fig. 2b has three stages: (1) heating from 25 °C to 180 °C with a 50 °C min−1 ramp rate; (2) hold at 180 °C for 1 hour; (3) cooling to 25 °C with a −10 °C min−1 nominal ramp rate. For the as-deposited film with r = 0.6, when temperature was elevated from 25 °C to 180 °C, the peaks at 12.84° and 25.82°, assigned to the 003 and 006 reflections of rhombohedral silver bismuth iodide, shift to 12.76° and 25.66°, respectively, due to the thermal expansion of the unit cell (Fig. 2d). During the dwell at 180 °C, the diffraction peaks at 12.76° and 25.66° become substantially attenuated, and three other dominant peaks form at 12.5°, 24°, and 25.08°, assigned to 111, 311 and 222 reflections of a cubic silver bismuth iodide structure and indicating the phase transition from the rhombohedral to the cubic structure. The observed lattice constant shift from 180 °C to 25 °C originates from thermal contraction of the resulting unit cell. The cubic phase remains stable, even upon cooling to room temperature (25 °C). The as-deposited and annealed TD-XRD films with r = 0.6 exhibit average compositions (as determined by SEM/EDX) of AgBi2.01I7.00 and Ag0.77Bi1.10I4.00 (Fig. S5a†), respectively, confirming removal of BiI3 from the film during the annealing cycle. This observation is consistent with earlier-described results for the annealed film without excess of BiI3. Fig. S3† shows no significant difference in the XRD patterns collected over a 6-month period (storage in N2), indicating high stability of cubic silver bismuth iodide in a nitrogen environment at room temperature.
 Fig. 2  Evolution of XRD patterns for Ag–Bi–I thin films deposited with (a) 0.6 and (c) 0.8 rate ratios, during the thermal annealing temperature vs. time profile shown in (b); in a nitrogen atmosphere, the temperature was raised from 25 to 180 °C using a 50 °C min−1 ramp rate, then held at 180 °C for 1 h, and finally cooled to 25 °C using a −10 °C min−1 ramp rate. (d) 1, 2 and (e) 3, 4 show the zoomed areas identified by red and yellow dashed squares in (a and c). 
For the as-deposited film with r = 0.8, at 25 °C four dominant diffraction peaks are observed at 12.68°, 23.97°, 25.06°, and 25.55°, characteristic of the rhombohedral crystal structure (Fig. 2c). Appearance of two extra rhombohedral diffraction peaks for r = 0.8 compared to the as-deposited r = 0.6 indicates a higher favorability of randomly-oriented grains for the Ag-rich rhombohedral phase. No phase transition appears during annealing of the thin film, confirming the stability of the rhombohedral phase for deposited silver bismuth iodide films with r = 0.8. The observed shifts via heating (25–180 °C) and cooling (180–25 °C) processes originate from thermal expansion and contraction of the unit cell, respectively. Owing to the overlap of the diffraction peaks detected from the as-deposited silver bismuth iodide film (r = 0.8) at 25 °C and the annealed film after the cooling process (from 180 to 25 °C) (Fig. S4†), it can be concluded that the size of the unit cell does not significantly change during annealing, confirming the stability of the stoichiometry of the treated film during TD-XRD. SEM/EDX compositional analysis verifies that the obtained composition for the as-deposited film of r = 0.8 (Ag1.62Bi1.06I5.00) remains largely unchanged (within the error of the EDX compositional analysis) for the annealed film (Ag1.84Bi1.04I5.00) (Fig. S5b†), presumably because these films already are Bi-poor relative to the films deposited at r = 0.6 (which do exhibit a structural change with annealing and a more substantial shift in composition).
All as-deposited films form primarily within a rhombohedral structure type. From the TD-XRD results, the probability of crystallographic phase transition to the cubic phase upon heating for silver bismuth iodide films is higher for Bi-rich as-deposited film compositions, which might be facilitated by the higher density of vacancies in the AgBi2I7 crystal structure, enabling vacancy-assisted Ag migration in the crystal via annealing.33 The phase transition predominantly revolves around a change in the composition from either AgBi2I7 to AgBiI4, for anneals without BiI3 vapor followed by a quenching process, or when the Bi-rich silver bismuth iodide film (AgBi2I7) slightly loses BiI3 (i.e. Ag1.20Bi1.85I7.00) via annealing under BiI3 vapor. Slight changes in the nominal AgBiI4 composition to either Bi-rich or Ag-rich variants apparently can induce formation of cubic or rhombohedral structures, respectively. On the other hand, increasing Ag-content of the as-deposited films from AgBi2I7 to Ag2BiI5 causes formation of rhombohedral unit cells with a slightly larger c lattice constant. The rhombohedral phase is the more favorable phase for Ag-rich film composition (i.e. near Ag2BiI5) at room and elevated temperatures (i.e. 180 °C). Composition is therefore clearly a critical parameter affecting the crystalline phase transition in silver bismuth iodide crystals. Since all compositions, regardless of Ag:Bi ratio, initially form in the rhombohedral form, it appears that temperature and/or thermal annealing can also play a role in the stabilization of the cubic phase. The structural phase transition might therefore additionally follow from an increase in the entropy of the system at elevated temperature. Further studies are needed to fully decipher the detailed nature of the crystallographic phase transitions.
Besides crystal structure analysis, the film grain structure and morphology were investigated using secondary electron SEM imaging. Fig. 3 shows the surface morphology and associated composition of as-deposited (first row) and post-annealed (second row) coevaporated films with r = 0.2 (Fig. 3a and b), 0.6 (Fig. 3c and d), 0.8 (Fig. 3e and f), and 1.2 (Fig. 3g and h). All of the deposited films were post-annealed at 180 °C for 15 min under BiI3 vapor, except the as-deposited film with r = 0.2 (180 °C for 15 min under N2). Increasing the annealing temperature above 200 °C results in the evaporation of the volatile BiI3, leaving yellow AgI on the substrate. For all the deposited films with different rate ratios, the as-deposited films consist of very small grains with average size of 100 nm (first row of Fig. 3). Upon annealing, significant grain growth occurs, leading to grains as wide as 3 μm for films with r = 0.2 and r = 0.6, and 300 nm for r = 0.8, with negligible pinhole densities in all the films. As can be seen in Fig. 3b, two types of grains grow in the annealed film of r = 0.2, indicating (in accordance with the XRD results) the coexistence of multiple phases in the film. Increasing the evaporation rate ratio to 1.2 leads to formation of tiny grains (<100 nm) and higher pinhole densities (marked by the arrows in Fig. 3h). From the obtained film morphologies, it is clear that Bi-rich films help promote formation of large grains via annealing, regardless of whether the film is annealed under BiI3 vapor (r = 0.6) or only under N2 (r = 0.2). SEM/EDX compositional analysis of the grown films in combination with SEM morphological characterization verify that sequential increase in the amount of AgI compared to BiI3 during the coevaporation process yields the Ag-rich Ag2BiI5 phase, promoting the growth of smaller grains via post-deposition annealing under BiI3 vapor.
 Fig. 3  SEM images of as-deposited (top) and annealed (bottom) films of Ag–Bi–I fabricated with r = (a and b) 0.2, (c and d) 0.6, (e and f) 0.8 and (g and h) 1.2 rate ratios, respectively. Two-step coevaporation/annealing, with annealing at 180 °C for 15 min under BiI3 vapor (r = 0.6, 0.8 and 1.2) or under N2 (r = 0.2), was performed to grow the films on glass substrates. Average composition of each film was determined by SEM/EDX and is listed in each panel. 
In order to determine the optical band gap of the Ag–Bi–I annealed films with different compositions, the absorption spectra were collected using UV-Vis optical spectroscopy (Fig. 4a). Tauc plots were constructed with the assumption of a direct band gap (Fig. 4b), leading to the values 1.80 eV, 1.83 eV, and 1.90 eV for AgBiI4, AgBi2I7, and Ag2BiI5 (estimated error = ±0.02), respectively, which correspond well with the previously published values for the solution-based films of AgBiI4,42,51 AgBi2I7,40 and Ag2BiI5.49 The increase in direct band gap energy from AgBi2I7 to Ag2BiI5 may perhaps be rationalized, at least in part, by an increased incorporation of the wide-band-gap AgI into the film structure. Due to uncertainty in the directness or indirectness of the band gaps for these compounds, the indirect band gap values of 1.72 eV, 1.72 eV, and 1.82 eV have also been deduced for AgBi2I7, AgBiI4, and Ag2BiI5 (estimated error = ±0.02), respectively (Fig. S6†). Photoluminescence (PL) measurements were also performed; however, measured PL intensities were low, suggesting either nominally indirect band gaps or prevalence of defects within the semiconducting films.

The electronic structure properties of AgBi2I7, AgBiI4, and Ag2BiI5 were studied using PES measurements on the Ag–Bi–I films with r = 0.6 and 0.8. According to our previous study,53 since sputter cleaning induces detrimental effects on silver bismuth iodide films, the PES study was performed on the as-loaded films. Prior to UPS and IPES measurements, compositional characterization was accomplished using XPS. Apart from presumably adventitious contributions of oxygen (530 eV) and carbon (285 eV), no other contaminants were detected for as-loaded samples (Fig. S7 and Table S2†). A close-up of the Ag 3d region demonstrates that the Ag content doubles for post deposition annealed films (under BiI3 vapor) of r = 0.8 compared to r = 0.6 (Fig. S8a†). Moreover, a close-up of the Bi 4f and I 3d regions (Fig. S8b and c†) for these films shows a significant decrease in the Bi content for the film with r = 0.8 (Ag2BiI5), in addition to reduced I content compared to the film with r = 0.6 (AgBi2I7). The observed trends in the XPS data for the fabricated films (Table S2†) are consistent with the obtained compositions from EDX analysis. Spectra of Bi 4f for the as-loaded AgBiI4 film reveal that N2 annealing of the deposited r = 0.6 Ag–Bi–I film results in the removal of volatile BiI3 from the film surface and an increase in the relative concentration of Ag, along with appearance of two small shoulders at binding energies of ∼162 and 157 eV (Fig. S8b†) originating from metallic Bi (Bi0).53 Sputter-cleaning of the AgBiI4 film for 5 and 10 s leads to more distinguishable shoulders (Fig. S9†), consistent with our recently published report on Rb3Bi2I9.53 Since no trace of metallic bismuth was realized for the annealed films under BiI3 vapor (AgBi2I7 and Ag2BiI5), Bi/I deficiency on the surface of the annealed Ag–Bi–I film under N2 (AgBiI4) might result in the formation of Bi0 on the surface. In our previous XPS studies on annealed films of BiI3,53 Rb3Bi2I9,53 and Cs3Sb2I9,54 traces of metallic bismuth and antimony (Sb0) were detected, consistent with the most recent report on (CH3NH3)3Bi2I9 and confirming the susceptibility of annealed Bi- and Sb-based semiconductors to form Bi0/Sb0 on the surface.55

Fig. 5 shows the UPS and IPES spectra of the as-loaded films corresponding to r = 0.6 and 0.8. A close up of the UPS He I secondary electron onsets, and combined valence band and IPES conduction band edges of these films are depicted in Fig. 5a and c, respectively. The intersection of tangent line fits to the features of interest and the background determines the positions of the secondary electron onsets (Eonset), valence band maxima (VBM) and conduction band minima (CBM) for the fabricated films (Table 1).

Based on the obtained UPS results, the ionization energies (IE = hν − (Eonset − EVBM)) are calculated to be 6.00 eV, 5.91 eV, and 5.80 eV for deposited AgBi2I7, AgBiI4, and Ag2BiI5 films, respectively, with the valence band maxima approximately 1.50 eV, 0.90 eV, and 1.30 eV below the Fermi levels. Furthermore, band gaps (Eg = CBM − VBM) of 1.70 eV and 1.86 eV are derived for AgBi2I7/Ag2BiI5 and AgBiI4 films, respectively. Considering the error margins for the calculation of the conduction band edge, which originate from the slowly varying background in the IPES spectra, the calculated band gaps from UPS/IPES are consistent with the optical band gaps. The estimated band positions for AgBi2I7 and AgBi2I5 (Fig. 5c, inset) are in good agreement with corresponding values reported for solution-processed films;40,49 however, to date, no band edge characterization has been reported for solution-based AgBiI4 thin films. From the UPS/IPES data, the fabricated AgBi2I7 and AgBi2I5 films are evidently n-type semiconductors, while AgBiI4 is essentially an intrinsic semiconductor.
After characterizing coevaporated silver bismuth iodide film properties, initial photovoltaic devices were prepared using a glass/FTO/TiO2/AgBiI4/P3HT/Au structure (Fig. 6a), in which the AgBiI4 serves as the absorber. For this study, a nominally planar interface between the TiO2 electron transport layer and AgBiI4 is employed (in contrast to the more typical mesoporous interface, used to facilitate charge extraction).40,43,48–52 Based on the SEM cross-sectional image, the thickness of the AgBiI4 layer is ∼400 nm, while the thicknesses of TiO2/P3HT and Au electrode are ∼20 nm and 70 nm, respectively. The annealed/slow-cooled AgBiI4 film on compact TiO2 adopts the rhombohedral phase, as determined using XRD analysis (Fig. S10†). The J–V curves were characterized by a large degree of hysteresis, with PCE measured with a reverse scan (0.89%) falling higher than the PCE measured in the forward scan (0.13%) (Fig. 6b). Here, forward and reverse scans refer respectively to sweeping the bias from low to high values, and vice versa. Given the crucial role of interfaces in PV devices,56–59 the observed hysteresis in this device architecture may originate from a contact barrier or surface-trap defects at the absorber–TiO2 interface, causing low carrier injection and interfacial recombination centers, respectively. The negligible hysteresis reported for some previous Ag–Bi–I solar cells in the literature might be related to the utilization of the mesoporous TiO2 layer, versus the simpler planar TiO2 in this study.40,49,50 Further investigation is needed to resolve the role and source of hysteresis, with respect to device performance.

Table 2 lists the device characteristics for forward and reverse J–V scans. The VOC values are 0.73 V in the forward and 0.84 V in the reverse scan directions, which are among the highest reported VOC values for Ag–Bi–I systems.40,43,48,49,51 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the AgBiI4 cell (Fig. 6c) shows a photocurrent edge below 700 nm (corresponding to ∼1.77 eV), consistent with the calculated direct band gap from the Tauc plot (1.80 eV). The JSC value (2.39 mA cm−2) acquired from the integration of the EQE spectrum closely matches the value acquired from the reverse scan J–V curve in Fig. 6b (2.37 mA cm−2). The EQE maximum for this device is 20% at ∼400 nm. The obtained low EQE, especially at higher wavelengths, is ascribed to considerable charge recombination occurring in the device. A possible factor in the low device performance might be the presence of Bi0 on the AgBiI4 film surface, as detected during the XPS study. Bi0 centers could provide recombination sites at the interface between the absorber and the other PV device layers or facilitate Fermi level pinning, thereby degrading device performance.

Conclusions
In summary, we have explored structural, compositional, optical and electrical properties of polycrystalline thin films of semiconducting silver bismuth iodides with general formula AgxBiyIz (z = x + 3y). A versatile two-step approach consisting of coevaporation of metal halides followed by annealing under various atmospheres has been applied for growing smooth and compact films of various Ag–Bi–I stoichiometries and crystal structures. Optimization of the coevaporation and post-deposition annealing processes led to the growth of single-phase cubic AgBi2I7 and AgBiI4, as well as rhombohedral AgBiI4 and Ag2BiI5. TD-XRD in combination with SEM/EDX compositional analysis reveal that, depending on the composition of the as-deposited films and annealing/cooling conditions, a phase transition from rhombohedral to spinel-defect cubic structure can occur. Initial studies on photovoltaic performance of rhombohedral AgBiI4 as light absorber demonstrated a large degree of hysteresis and VOC of as high as 0.84 V and PCE of ∼0.9% for the reverse scan direction in a planar heterojunction solar cell. Future optimization of planar junction solar cells based on Ag–Bi–I compositions should involve examining the dependence of performance on absorber composition, thickness, as well as device structure.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Experimental XRD patterns for as-deposited (left) and annealed (right) thin films of Ag–Bi–I grown with r = (a) 0.2, (b) 0.6, (c) 0.8, and (d) 1.2 rate ratios. All films were annealed at 180 °C for 15 min under BiI3 vapor, except the as-deposited film of r = 0.2 (180 °C for 15 min in N2). The as-deposited films index to a rhombohedral structure. Small peaks due to BiI3 and AgI impurities are marked with “*” and “+”, respectively. For r = 0.6 and 0.8 annealed films, all peaks index to the known cubic (e) and rhombohedral (f) structure types, respectively. Selected strong diffraction peaks are labeled for each structure type. Unit cell/fitting parameters are listed in Table S1.†	 

 	Fig. 2  Evolution of XRD patterns for Ag–Bi–I thin films deposited with (a) 0.6 and (c) 0.8 rate ratios, during the thermal annealing temperature vs. time profile shown in (b); in a nitrogen atmosphere, the temperature was raised from 25 to 180 °C using a 50 °C min−1 ramp rate, then held at 180 °C for 1 h, and finally cooled to 25 °C using a −10 °C min−1 ramp rate. (d) 1, 2 and (e) 3, 4 show the zoomed areas identified by red and yellow dashed squares in (a and c).	 

 	Fig. 3  SEM images of as-deposited (top) and annealed (bottom) films of Ag–Bi–I fabricated with r = (a and b) 0.2, (c and d) 0.6, (e and f) 0.8 and (g and h) 1.2 rate ratios, respectively. Two-step coevaporation/annealing, with annealing at 180 °C for 15 min under BiI3 vapor (r = 0.6, 0.8 and 1.2) or under N2 (r = 0.2), was performed to grow the films on glass substrates. Average composition of each film was determined by SEM/EDX and is listed in each panel.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Absorption spectra of AgBiI4, AgBi2I7 and Ag2BiI5 films, deposited using the two-step coevaporation approach on glass substrates and (b) Tauc plots of the corresponding films calculated from UV-Vis spectroscopy data assuming direct band gaps.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Close up of UPS He I secondary electron onset, (b) scan of valence band states, and (c) close up of the UPS He I valence band edge and IPES conduction band edge of the as-loaded post-deposition annealed Ag–Bi–I films. Tangent lines are drawn to indicate the onset, valence band edge and conduction band edge locations. The inset gives the band positions for the grown thin films with r = 0.6 (AgBi2I7 and AgBiI4) and r = 0.8 (Ag2BiI5), derived from UPS and IPES measurements.
