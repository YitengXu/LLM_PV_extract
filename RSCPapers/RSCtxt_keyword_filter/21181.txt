    , Accepted 13th November 2016First published on 14th November 2016AbstractWe report the fabrication and optimization of multipass inkjet-printed perovskite solar cells. The presented process allows excellent control of crystallization dynamics and thickness of the perovskite layer. In order to obtain a homogenous perovskite film of large and densely packed crystals on a planar TiO2 electron transport layer we make use of an additional vacuum annealing step. Its beneficial impact was characterized in terms of device performance and laser beam induced current mapping as well as atomic force microscopy. The optimized fabrication methods resulted in power conversion efficiencies up to 11.3% of multipass inkjet printed perovskite solar cells. The spin coated reference devices reached 12.8% power conversion efficiency. With these first results, we advance the field of digital printing techniques for perovskites and demonstrate a major step towards highly efficient, low-cost and less Pb-waste producing perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials for optoelectronic applications have attracted enormous interest in recent years. Their great promise is based on their unique optoelectronic properties, combining long charge-carrier lifetimes, very low non-radiative recombination rates and a high absorption coefficient. Moreover, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites feature the ability to control the bandgap via stoichiometric variations and the compatibility with low-cost solution-based deposition techniques.1–8
These unique material properties have triggered enormous technological interest in research and development with photovoltaics being the main driving technology. In 2016, perovskite solar cells have reached record power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) above 22%, thereby approaching the PCEs of well-established thin-film solar cells based on cadmium telluride (CdTe) or copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS).9 Their low-temperature processability also enables device fabrication on mechanically flexible substrates.10,11 To be interesting for the mass market, perovskite solar cell applications have to tackle the serious issues of reproducibility and long-term stability, which occur mostly from degradation of water and humidity in the processing air, as well as the toxic lead content, which is inalienable to the public.12–15
Beyond their application in solar cells, organo-lead halide hybrid perovskite materials have shown excellent performance in light emitting devices, such as optically pumped lasers and light emitting diodes. Even the color of these devices is tunable via stoichiometric variations in the perovskite, e.g. by varying the iodine/bromine ratio.16–18 Based on these exciting first results, a manifold of applications are envisaged, i.e. displays, photodetectors or lasers.19–22 The considered perovskite materials are all compatible with solution-processing, offering exciting routes for scalable low-cost deposition e.g. via spray coating or slot-die coating.23–27 For small areas and integrated devices digital printing techniques such as inkjet printing may be more suitable. The first reports involving inkjet printing of perovskite based solar cells have dealt either with printing of methylammonium/formamidinium iodide onto a spin coated lead iodide (PbI2) layer in a two-step process or with printing of a chlorine containing perovskite precursor in a one-step process.28–31
In this work, we focus on the digital inkjet printing of perovskite layers for photovoltaic applications. Ink-jet printing is a versatile technique that offers the advantage of printing small and digital areas rapidly. The technology has reached large area industrial applications such as next generation OLED production lines by Kateeva and LG.32,33 Inkjet printing is a non-contact printing technique, so there is no mechanical stress between the printer and substrate. The drop on demand setup allows for direct control of material deposition, which leads to an overall reduction of material usage and less material waste. With this, it is more likely to use toxic lead containing inks with digital printing techniques than the above mentioned casting techniques. In contrast to spin coating, inkjet printing decouples the deposition and the film drying process which allows for better control of perovskite film formation. The interplay between the underlying layer and the ink solvent choice is crucial for the formation of the desired morphology and composition. One of the key challenges of perovskites is their processing, i.e. the crystallization into closed layers has shown to be very sensitive to the process environment and extremely process dependent.11 Seok et al. described already the positive effects of using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a solvent for smooth methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite film formation on a mesoporous titanium oxide (TiO2) substrate.13 In this work, we demonstrate the use of inkjet printing for fabricating closed perovskite layers based on one-step deposition. Moreover, we focus on perovskite solar cells in the so-called planar configuration. We investigate the interplay between crystallization dynamics of the perovskite films, the quality of a closed perovskite layer, and the thickness thereof. For optimized perovskite films, prototype solar cell devices have been fabricated and compared by means of power conversion efficiency, crystal structure and spatially resolved photocurrent measurements.
Results and discussion
In the following, we report thickness controlled deposition of perovskite layers by inkjet printing and their integration into solar cells. First, we introduce the vacuum annealing step and point out its importance on the crystallization process of the printed perovskite layers. In the second section, we show the influence of various multipass printing parameters and their influence on the crystallization dynamics, layer thickness and PCE. The third section puts the results in perspective and compares the printed and spin-cast reference devices in terms of layer homogeneity and PCE.
Multipass inkjet printed perovskite films and improved crystallization via vacuum annealing
In our experiments, all the samples were built on transparent fluorine doped tin-oxide (FTO) coated glass with a 40 nm compact TiO2 hole blocking layer. The ink consists of 0.7 M MAPbI3 (MAI:PbI2 in 1:1 ratio) in a mixture of gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in a 7:3 volume ratio as reported in the literature.13 The printing process was done under cleanroom conditions (22 °C/45% humidity). A doped 2,2,7,7-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (Spiro-MeOTAD) layer was deposited by spin coating as the hole transport layer, followed by evaporation of a gold back electrode.
The digital inkjet printing technique is a favorable method to fabricate rapidly small areas of active material. In this work a Dimatix DMP 2800 inkjet printing system with 16 piezo electric driven nozzles was used. The key challenge is to match the perovskite ink to the TiO2 surface in terms of wettability and film formation, which can be controlled by the choice of solvent, ink and substrate temperature and printing parameters like drop size and amount of drops. High boiling point solvents are preferred for inkjet printing; both to prevent nozzle clogging of the print head and for better film formation. In this work, a mixture of GBL and DMSO was used, whereas GBL serves as a high boiling point solvent and DMSO as a chemical reactant agent for the perovskite precursor, according to the explanation given in ref. 13. An additional drop treatment of a perovskite anti solvent, e.g. toluene during spinning of the substrate leads to a perovskite intermediate phase and the elimination of excess solvent in the film. This anti solvent treatment allows to obtain closed and flat perovskite layers via spin coating, but is not suitable for inkjet printing, due to the slower drying mechanism. The crucial point is the slow solvent evaporation rate during the printing process, which increases the relaxation time of the perovskite film to form a smooth layer.8,34 These observed dynamics are in severe contrast to the spin coating process, whereas the film dries rapidly during spinning of the substrate. For inkjet printing, we target the deposition of a smooth wet film which is sequentially converted into a closed perovskite layer.
Based on the decoupling of the perovskite crystallization and layer deposition in the inkjet printing process, a common approach for better film controlling is to use an additional annealing step after printing the perovskite solution and before the complete conversion of perovskite via thermal annealing, which is sketched in Fig. 1a.34–36 We will show below that vacuum annealing after the printing process proved to be crucial for homogenous film formation and working perovskite solar cells via inkjet printing.

(b) Bright field microscopy image of inkjet printed perovskite droplets with a diameter of 75 μm. (c) Complete perovskite solar cell. (d) Large area inkjet printed perovskite layer. 

Fig. 1b shows a bright field microscopy image of an array of printed perovskite droplets on top of compact TiO2. The droplet diameter is calculated to be 75 ± 3 μm. Fig. 1c shows an image of a complete perovskite solar cell and Fig. 1d depicts the possible usage of inkjet printing for larger areas in the cm range.
In Fig. 2, white light interferometry images of four different perovskite layers are shown. We note that the height scale is different for each image, to provide all relevant surface topographic information. Transferring the printed wet film directly onto the 100 °C hotplate led to a peak to valley roughness of around 800 nm (see Fig. 2a). The direct sintering of the printed layer on the hotplate leads to solvent boiling and the formation of large perovskite islands. The crystallization process of the inkjet printed perovskite layer is depicted in Fig. S1 and Video S1.† By introducing vacuum annealing, the wet films become smooth and a complete surface coverage can be achieved after 2 min and 5 min (see Fig. 2b and c). Further increase of the vacuum annealing time to 10 min again led to rough perovskite surfaces (Fig. 2d).

To verify the morphological observations, first devices were fabricated and electrically characterized. The results are depicted in Table 1. As expected, the non-vacuum annealed sample shows low photovoltaic performance due to the non-uniform layer. Both samples vacuum annealed for 2 min and 5 min exhibit PCEs of 4.5% and 4.3% respectively, which is well in agreement with the similar layer formation observed in the microscopy images (Fig. 2b and c). The device performance of the 10 min annealed sample decreases to 2.4% which is attributed to the rougher perovskite surface. The moderate solar cell efficiencies can also partly be attributed to the low film thickness of 180 nm.

Influence of multipass inkjet printing parameters on crystallization dynamics and layer thicknesses
The key advantage of digital inkjet printing is the control of layer thickness by two parameters: (1) the number of printed sublayers and (2) the drop spacing. The latter refers to the distance between two printed drops, which changes the total number of printed drops per area and influences directly the wet layer thickness. In the following, we explore these two routes to control the thickness of the perovskite film.
In Fig. 3, atomic force microscopy images of representative areas of the resulting perovskite layers on top of structured FTO/TiO2 substrates are shown. Fig. 3a–c show increasing layer thicknesses with increasing the number of deposited sublayers. Hereby, the drop spacing is set to 45 μm, which allows printing of closed and smooth layers. The film thicknesses are 180 nm, 310 nm and 480 nm. The trend to larger crystals with increasing number of sublayers is clearly visible. The grain sizes are calculated with the free software tool gwyddion to be 120 nm, 150 nm and 210 nm respectively. The higher number of printed sublayers corresponds to a higher amount of drops and, hence, more perovskite material on the substrate. Fig. 3b, d and e show printed layers with different varying drop spacing and number of sublayers but with comparable thicknesses of 310–320 nm. Hence, the total number of drops, i.e. the total amount of perovskite ink printed onto the substrate is controlled. Obviously, the grain size increases with the number of printed sublayers from 145 nm (1 sublayer) to 150 nm (2 sublayer) and 170 nm (3 sublayer). The reason for the increasing grain size with the number of printed sublayers could be that, in the case of printing multiple layers, the printed first layer starts drying and forming seed crystals. The next layer partly dissolves the surface again and crystals grow from that seed crystals. To complement the series, Fig. 3f shows the spin-cast reference layer after toluene treatment. With a film thickness of 460 nm and grain sizes of 240 nm its properties are very comparable to the film depicted in Fig. 3c.
 Fig. 3  Atomic force microscopy images of printed MAPbI3 layers on top of FTO/TiO2 after annealing at 100 °C with different printing parameters (5 × 4.5 μm2). The values are given as follows: number of layer times drop spacing, (a) 1@45 μm, (b) 2@45 μm, (c) 3@45 μm, (d) 1@30 μm, (e) 3@60 μm and (f) spin-cast reference. 
Fig. S2† depicts in more detail the surface coverage of the printed perovskite layers, indicating that the surfaces are really homogeneous and nearly independent of the used drop distances.
Then, we incorporated the perovskite layers into solar cells. In Table 2 the extracted solar cell characteristics are summarized for the hero devices. Table S2† shows the dataset of printed devices for two batches, supporting our presented findings. First, increasing the layer thickness by printing one, two or three sublayers increases the film thickness and the overall PCE, mainly due to an increase in current density, due to a higher photon absorption.37,38 The PCEs increase from 4.4% to 11.3%, while the layer thicknesses increase from 180 nm to 480 nm. Second, the effect of increasing grain size with increasing number of printed layers at a constant layer thickness shows no impact on the PCEs. The efficiency of devices with printing parameters 1@30 μm, 2@45 μm and 3@60 μm is 5.1%, 5.7% and 5.2% respectively. Third, the high PCE of 11.3% fabricated by inkjet printing of the perovskite absorber is just 12% lower than that of the spin-cast reference device which reaches a PCE of 12.8%. The high current densities for both the optimized printed device and the reference device show efficient charge carrier transport. Thus the crystals are large enough on the planar TiO2 blocking layer.

Comparison of inkjet printed and spin-cast perovskite layers by means of layer homogeneity and device performance
Having identified and presented two key steps for the fabrication of highly efficient inkjet printed perovskite solar cells, we investigate further in detail the formation of the perovskite absorber layer on the TiO2 substrate. Therefore, XRD measurements were performed in order to validate the conversion of the precursors into perovskite. In Fig. 4a, the XRD diffraction patterns of the spin-cast and the optimized printed layer are shown. Both patterns show the same main peaks of a tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite structure at 14.1, 20.0, 28.4, 32.0 and 40.5° assigned to (110), (112), (220), (310) and (330) crystal orientation. This leads to the assumption that the formed perovskite layer is highly polycrystalline with no preferred crystal orientation. For the printed layer an additional small peak at 12.7° appears, which corresponds to PbI2 excess in the absorber layer. Hence MAI and PbI2 were not fully converted into perovskite in the inkjet printed device, although the additional vacuum annealing step was introduced. The effect is even more pronounced for thinner printed layers, which is shown in Fig. S4.†
 Fig. 4  Comparison of three devices. Blue marks the printed solar cell omitting vacuum annealing. Red represents the optimized printed device after 2 min vacuum annealing and black refers to the spin-cast reference device. (a) XRD diffraction patterns, (b) J–V curves and (c) light beam induced current mapping with the normalized Z-axis. 
To study the homogeneity, Laser Beam Induced Current (LBIC) measurements are performed on working devices, by measuring their device currents spatially resolved through scanning the active areas of the solar cells with a focused laser beam. The normalized current maps of the spin-cast and printed devices are shown in Fig. 4c. The printed devices that were not subjected to vacuum annealing show an irregular pattern. Just a few prominent areas contribute to the device currents and hence to the solar cell PCEs at a very low level. The vacuum annealed printed device exhibits higher local currents with some hot spots. The spin-cast device exhibits the most homogeneous current generation on the cell area of 3 × 3 mm2. In Fig. S3† the corresponding white light interferometry images are depicted to correlate the LBIC signal fluctuations with the surface roughness of the printed perovskite layer.
The sharp edges of the solar cells' photocurrent maps originate from the overlap of the well-defined etched FTO and evaporated Au electrode.

Fig. 4b shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of typical devices under 1 sun illumination and in the dark. Black represents the spin-cast reference cell, red the devices with printed perovskite layer after vacuum annealing and (blue) omitting vacuum annealing. With a JSC of 19.9 mA cm−2, a VOC of 1.00 V, a FF of 0.63 and a PCE of 12.6%, the spin-cast reference device proves to be a highly efficient planar device with MAPBI3 perovskite. We observe a severe hysteresis in the fabricated devices, which is shown in Fig. S5.† We attribute the hysteresis to the used perovskite precursor system under ambient conditions and its cell architecture with Spiro-MeOTAD as the hole transport layer. The printed device without vacuum annealing yields only moderate photovoltaic performance. The corresponding values for JSC, VOC, FF and PCE are 9.6 mA cm−2, 0.62 V, 0.30 and 1.8%. This performance can be attributed to a not fully closed absorber layer as shown in Fig. 1, which is underlined by the high dark current. The printed device after vacuum annealing shows high values of 18.4 mA cm−2, 0.98 V, 0.57, 10.4% for JSC, VOC, FF and PCE respectively. The PCE of the printed device reaches more than 88% (rel.) of the spin-cast reference device. This shows that inkjet printing is a feasible technique to fabricate small area high performance perovskite solar cells for optoelectronic devices.
Conclusions
In this work, we report the fabrication and optimization of multipass inkjet printed perovskite solar cells. Our process allows controlling the perovskite film thickness and crystal size by multipass inkjet printing of a MAPbI3-ink and simultaneously achieving high PCEs in solar cells. We show that in a planar perovskite solar cell device architecture, the film thickness and crystal size can be easily controlled by common printing parameters like drop spacing and the number of printed sublayers. In particular, the film formation and crystallization of the perovskite layer depend strongly on the post processing treatment. In this regard, we introduce vacuum annealing after the printing process. This step proved to be a key process step towards high-PCE inkjet printed perovskite solar cells. As a result, a PCE of 11.3% was achieved by inkjet printing the active perovskite layer, reaching more than 88% (rel.) of the spin-cast reference device performance of 12.8%. XRD patterns show that the transformation of the printed perovskite layer can be improved to avoid PbI2 residuals. Using the LBIC measurements, we learned that further improvement of the perovskite film should increase the PCE of inkjet printed devices. The focus of ongoing research is the increase of PCE and embedding of perovskite layers in other optoelectronic devices.
Experimental details
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
Planar perovskite layers and solar cells were prepared as follows. 1.1 mm thick fluorine doped tin-oxide (FTO) coated glass from Dyenamo AB was patterned by etching with zinc powder and hydrochloric acid. The substrates were cleaned sequentially in an ultrasonic bath with deionized water, acetone and isopropanol for 10 min each. For better wettability, the substrates were treated under oxygen plasma for 5 min, before the spin coating process of the TiO2 precursor solution. All the following spin coating and printing steps were performed under controlled ambient conditions with a relative humidity of 45%. The compact TiO2 blocking layer (40 nm) was fabricated by solution processing from a stock solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in ethanol (1:39 vol%) by sequential spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealing for 5 min at 100 °C in between. The wet film was wiped away at the FTO contacts. These steps are repeated 3 times. The samples were sintered under atmospheric conditions in a furnace at 500 °C for 1 h and cooled down to 120 °C overnight.
The perovskite reference device was spin coated using a 1.4 M MAPbI3 (1:1 mass ratio of MAI:PbI2) solution in gamma-butyrolacetone:dimethylsulfoxide (7:3 vol ratio). The solution was heated up to 65 °C and spin coated at 1000 rpm for 13 s, followed by 5000 rpm for 25 s. An additional toluene drip 15 s before the substrate stops spinning was introduced for homogeneous film formation as reported in the study of Seok et al.13
The inkjet printing was performed on a Dimatix Fujifilm DMP 2800, including the piezoelectric driven inkjet head DMC11610 with a nozzle diameter of 21 μm. Therefore, the ink was diluted to a 0.7 M MAPbI3 solution and filtered (0.45 μm PVDF). The ink was jetted at 35 °C on a plate at 22 °C. After printing, the substrates were dried under vacuum conditions at 1 mbar for different periods of time. The samples were annealed for 10 min under a nitrogen flow at 100 °C. The hole transport material, Spiro-MeOTAD, was spin-cast at 4000 rpm for 30 s without any further annealing process. The formulation was prepared in a nitrogen filled glovebox as follows: 80 mg 2,2,7,7-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (Spiro-MeOTAD) was added to 1 mL chlorobenzene, 28.5 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-tBP) and 17.5 μL of a stock solution of 520 mg bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt in acetonitrile. Finally, a 65 nm thick gold electrode was thermally evaporated on top. The cell area is defined by the overlap of FTO and Au electrodes to 9 mm2.
Characterization
Layer thicknesses were measured using a Vecco Dektak 150 profilometer system. The atomic force microscopy images were obtained by using DME-Scan Tool™ in tapping mode. White light interferometry images were obtained using a Sensofar Plu neox system with a Nikon objective of 10× magnification. The J–V-characteristics were recorded with a Keithley 2601B source meter at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 under controlled ambient conditions (45% humidity at 22 °C). The sweep direction is from 1.1 V to 0 V. The light source is a 1000 W xenon lamp calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 under AM 1.5G solar light conditions with a certified silicon solar cell. The consistency of measured current density is checked by measuring the J–V characteristics with and without a shadow mask of 9 mm2. The LBIC system uses a He–Ne-laser (output power 2.0 mW, wavelength 543 nm, Newport R-30972), chopped at 300 Hz. The laser is focused by an objective (OD 4.0, Achromatic Intl. Standard Objective, Edmund Optics) onto the substrate, yielding an effective spot diameter of about 40 μm. The laser spot was fixed while the samples moved on two linear translation stages (150 mm linear translation stage, Thorlabs) to scan the active layer. The cells' photocurrents were measured using a transimpedance amplifier (CVI 13AMP003/A, Melles Griot) and a lock-in amplifier (USB LockIn 250, Anfatec Instruments), the latter synchronized with the optical chopper. XRD patterns were measured with a Bruker D8 Discovery system with a Cu Ka source.
