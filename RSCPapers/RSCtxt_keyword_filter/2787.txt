    , Accepted 3rd March 2021First published on 3rd March 2021AbstractQuantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs), which are cost-effective, facilely prepared and environmentally friendly, are regarded as a promising third-generation photovoltaic technology, although the conversion efficiency of QDSSCs is still far lower than the theoretical efficiency (44%). Furthermore, the traditional Cu2S/brass counter electrode (CE) is susceptible to continuous corrosion from the polysulfide electrolyte, reducing the stability and electrocatalytic activity of the CE, thereby affecting cell performance. To enhance the stability of the Cu2S CE and make full use of its excellent catalytic properties, we used eco-friendly polyoxometalates (K6SiW11O39Co(II) (H2O), SiW11Co) and porous sponge-like CuO as precursors to prepare a novel SiW11Co-doped high-efficiency Cu2S/SiW11Co CE on FTO by adopting the method of in situ sulfidation in the electrolyte. Electrochemical analysis revealed that the novel Cu2S/2%-SiW11Co (Cu2S-2) CE exhibits extremely high stability and electrocatalytic performance compared with other electrodes. Meanwhile, adding an appropriate amount of SiW11Co can inhibit charge recombination and improve cell performance. The CdS/CdSe co-sensitized QDSSCs assembled with the novel Cu2S-2 CE obtained a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.94%, which was 20% more efficient than QDSSCs based on Cu2S/brass CE (4.96%). The method reported here puts forth a new direction for the preparation of efficient Cu2S counter electrodes.
1. Introduction
The energy problem is one that humanity needs to solve at present, and especially in the future.1 Overexploitation and use of nonrenewable energy sources have brought global pollution along with the increased energy demand. Therefore, we need to explore renewable clean energy to solve these problems immediately.2–8 Owing to its clean, low-cost and abundant merits, solar energy shows high promise.9 Undoubtedly, the rational use and efficient development of solar energy is of great significance to the future of mankind.10–19 Solar energy has also been applied in many other fields.4,20–24 Photovoltaic equipment is a relatively ideal way to directly convert this renewable energy into electrical energy. Hence, research on solar cells has aroused great interest.25 In the third generation of solar cells, quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs), due to their unique properties, such as bandgap tunability caused by QD size, great absorption coefficient, good repeatability, excellent light stability, large intrinsic dipole moments, multiple exciton formation, low cost and high theoretical conversion efficiency,9 have attracted extensive research.26–30 However, in the process of meeting human energy needs, there is still a long way to go.
QDSSCs have a sandwiched structure similar to dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), containing a photoanode modified with a quantum dot sensitizer, a counter electrode (CE), and polysulfide electrolyte.31 In addition, the working principle of QDSSCs is also analogous to that of DSSCs. According to their band gap energy, quantum dot materials absorb incident sunlight in a certain wavelength range, causing the creation of electron–hole pairs.25 Then, owing to their band offsets, the photoexcitons are separated. The electrons transfer to the external circuit through metal oxide and transparent conductive glass, under the electrocatalysis of the CE, catalyzing the reduction of oxidizing substances in the polysulfide electrolyte. Inversely, the holes oxidize the reductive substance, thus forming a complete working cycle.32 So, to enhance the energy conversion efficiency of the cells, each section of the device is of vital importance. Although the PCE of QDSSCs has reached 13.08% with the Zn–Cu–In–Se QD-modified photoanode and Cu2S/brass (or MC/Ti) CE, nevertheless, there is still a big gap until its theoretical efficiency of 44%.33 Consequently, exploring and optimizing all sections of the cell is particularly significant for improving its efficiency.
In recent years, much attention has been paid to quantum dot sensitizers and interface engineering to achieve higher efficiency.34,35 For some binary quantum dots in use, it is almost impossible to meet the requirements to cover the entire near-infrared spectrum, which has led to the study of ternary and quaternary quantum dots.36 However, the synthesis of some multi-element quantum dots requires strict conditions, which increases the difficulty of the experiment. As an integral part of the QDSSCs, CEs play the role of collecting and transmitting electrons from the external circuit, catalytically reducing the electrolyte at the interface.37–39 Therefore, strengthening the research on CEs is of great significance for obtaining high-performance solar cells. Metal sulfide CEs (e.g., NiS, CuS, CoS, PbS, Cu2S) are widely studied. Among them, Cu2S CE is the most commonly used in QDSSCs due to its excellent catalytic activity, and most of the reported high-efficiency solar cells are derived from this counter-electrode system.40 Currently, a common strategy for manufacturing Cu2S CE is to first strip brass foil (copper–zinc alloy) with HCl to remove Zn, and then immerse the resulting products in a polysulfide electrolyte to obtain a Cu2S interface layer (Cu2S/brass CE) on a copper substrate. However, the Cu2S film obtained by this in situ preparation method is not dense enough, and there is continuous corrosion of the brass substrate by the polysulfide electrolyte, resulting in poor stability and mechanical properties.35,41 Moreover, the Cu2S film on the copper substrate comes off during the reaction, leading to a sharp decline in its photoelectric performance.42
For make full use of the excellent catalytic activity of Cu2S, many researchers are committed to improving the Cu2S preparation method. Thampi et al. deposited a layer of copper film on FTO by electrodeposition method, then immersed it into the electrolyte to obtain Cu2S CE.43 By combining the optimized CdS/TiO2 photoanode with Cu2S electrode, the efficiency of the cell reached 2.6%, which was 1.85% when applied with the Cu2S/brass CE. Zhong et al. also prepared the Cu2S CE by electrodeposition followed by immersion, and obtained almost similar cell efficiency with the Cu2S/brass-based solar cell.42 But the stability of the cell has been greatly enhanced. Selopal et al. used the spray pyrolysis method to prepare the Cu2S CE, with good reproducibility of results.44 Sun et al. prepared Cu2S/ITO CE by ion exchange method.45 Flowered CuO/Cu(OH)2 nanorods were manufactured on brass foil by Liang et al. using the alternate current etching method, immersing them into electrolyte to obtain CuS/brass electrode, which presented favorable stability.46 However, the above synthetic methods have different inconveniences, including extensive equipment requirements, high temperature, stringent reaction conditions and high cost.47 Hence, it is still a formidable mission to prepare CuxS CEs with the anticipated properties by a rapid and low-cost method. Polyoxometalates (POMs), which have outstanding redox reversibility, play a significant role in promoting photogenerated carrier transport and inhibiting the recombination of electron–hole pairs.48 K6SiW11O39Co(II) (H2O) (SiW11Co) is a Keggin-type POM with superior catalytic properties due to its potentially diverse active sites.49–52 Its energy band and lattice are more matched with Cu2S, which is conducive to electron collection and transfer, thereby making the reduction of Sn2− in the polysulfide electrolyte more effective. Consequently, combining the eco-friendly POMs with semiconductor materials for the CEs of QDSSCs could profoundly improve cell performance.
Herein, CuO-SiW11Co nanocomposite with porous sponge-like morphology was successfully synthesized for the first time using cupric nitrate, urea and SiW11Co as precursors through a facile hydrothermal and post-calcination method. Thereafter, it was loaded on the FTO by screen printing followed by immersing in the polysulfide electrolyte for several seconds to obtain the Cu2S-SiW11Co/FTO CE. This method of in situ synthesis of Cu2S counter electrode is fast and simple. The Cu2S-SiW11Co film is firmly attached to the FTO substrate, combining the excellent conductivity of FTO with the prominent catalytic activity of Cu2S, which avoids the corrosion from the electrolyte of the conventional Cu2S/brass CE and increases the stability of the system. Meanwhile, to explore the optimal doping ratio of SiW11Co, the mass percentage of SiW11Co and copper source was changed from 0 (Cu2S) to 1.5 (Cu2S-1.5), 2 (Cu2S-2), 2.5 (Cu2S-2.5) and 3 (Cu2S-3). By adopting EIS, Tafel, CV and OCVD tests, we discovered Cu2S-2 CE has superior electrocatalytic performance, conductivity and stability. Under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5 G, the QDSSCs fabricated with Cu2S and Cu2S/brass CEs demonstrated extremely similar PCE. However, the QDSSCs with Cu2S-2 CE obtained a PCE of 5.94% with a Jsc of 21.33 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.54 V and FF of 0.52, which is higher than that of Cu2S/brass CE. In brief, the preparation of Cu2S CE with porous sponge-like CuO as precursor by in situ method reported in this paper can improve the electrode stability. Simultaneously, the addition of SiW11Co makes the electron transport process of the system smoother and inhibits charge recombination, thereby enhancing the cell performance.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All reagents were used directly after purchase, without any purification. Deionized water (DI) generated by the Milli-Q Gradient A10 system was utilized in the preparation of different solutions.
2.2. Preparation of porous sponge-like SiW11Co-CuO
Both Cu2(OH)2CO3 and CuO were prepared by referring to the previous literature with some modification.9 Briefly, 0.04 mM Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, 0.2 mM urea and SiW11Co (whose synthesis method is described in the ESI†) were dissolved in distilled water successively and stirred for a certain time at ambient temperature. The solution was transferred to a 80 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave, sealed, and reacted in a thermostat at 120 °C for 5 h. The obtained precursor was centrifuged several times with distilled water and ethanol, then dried at 50 °C for 10 h. Subsequently, the product was placed in a muffle furnace and calcined at 350 °C for 150 min, with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 to acquire the porous stacked sponge-like CuO. To explore the optimal doping ratio of SiW11Co, the mass percentage of SiW11Co and copper source was changed from 0 (CuO-0) to 1.5 (CuO-1.5), 2 (CuO-2), 2.5 (CuO-2.5) and 3 (CuO-3).
2.3. Preparation of SiW11Co-Cu2S counter electrode
The cut FTO (F: SnO2, 2 cm × 2.5 cm) was firstly cleaned. Different proportions of SiW11Co-CuO slurry were prepared by mixing moderate SiW11Co-CuO powders with ethyl cellulose as binder, ethanol as solvent and α-terpineol as disperser and completely ground until the ethanol evaporated. Afterwards, the screen printing method was used to coat the paste on the as-cleaned FTO, which was then placed on a heating plate at 80 °C for 0.5 h. After being naturally cooled to room temperature, the SiW11Co-CuO/FTO film was sintered at 300 °C for 40 min to eliminate the binder and strengthen the contact between the membrane and FTO substrate.53 Finally, the SiW11Co-CuO/FTO film was immersed in polysulfide electrolyte for 30s, rinsing with DI and drying it to obtain the various ratios of SiW11Co-Cu2S/FTO CEs, classifying them as Cu2S, Cu2S-1.5, Cu2S-2, Cu2S-2.5 and Cu2S-3.
2.4. Fabrication of ZnS/CdSe/CdS/TiO2 photoanodes
Here we describe the formation of TiO2 film. P25 and α-terpineol were mixed with a mass ratio of 1:6.5, obtaining a uniform TiO2 slurry after ball-milling for 10 hours.54 Then, the TiO2 paste was coated on the clean FTO by doctor-blade technique, dried at 70 °C for 20 min and annealed at 450 °C for 0.5 h to obtain the TiO2 film.
To assemble the CdSe/CdS/TiO2 photoanode, QDs were deposited on the TiO2 film by chemical bath deposition (CBD) method in a refrigerator below 5 °C. In detail, CdS seed layer was obtained by vertically immersing the TiO2 photoanode in an aqueous solution (including 16 mM CdCl2; 112 mM thiourea; 52.8 mM NH4Cl) and adjusting the pH to about 9.5 for 3–4 h, followed by rinsing thoroughly with deionized water.55 Subsequently, the deposition of CdSe QDs on CdS/TiO2 was conducted in a mixed solution containing Na2SeSO3, CdSO4·8/3H2O and N(CH2COONa)3 with a volume ratio of 1:1:1 for 8 h, then washed several times with DI. The Na2SeSO3 solution was obtained by dissolving Se powder (0.05 M) in Na2SO3 (0.15 M) solution and heating at 90 °C for 6 h under N2 atmosphere. Ultimately, the photoanode was deposited in Zn(CH3COO)2 and Na2S solution for 1 minute, respectively, and three cycles were performed to build a ZnS passivation layer.
2.5. Assembly of QDSSCs
The as-prepared ZnS/CdSe/CdS/TiO2 films with an active area of 0.12 cm−2 were sandwiched with the SiW11Co-Cu2S (or Cu2S/brass) CEs by insulated tape. The space between the two electrodes was filled with 30 μL polysulfide electrolyte consisting of 1 M Na2S·9H2O, 0.4 M KCl, and 0.25 M S in a mixture of water and methanol with a volume ratio of 7:3. Two CEs were encapsulated to obtain sandwiched symmetric cells, which were injected with the same electrolyte for various electrochemical tests.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology and compositions
The microstructure of the as-prepared products was characterized by SEM. As revealed in Fig. 1a–c, high-resolution SEM images of various sizes of CuO are presented clearly. Apparently, the porous sponge-like CuO nanostructures are sequentially stacked, and most porous sponges exhibit similar spatial volumes. Besides, Fig. 1d–f presents the SEM pictures of CuO with SiW11Co (CuO-2). It can be seen that the addition of SiW11Co makes the interior of the material more loose and porous, and the number of pores per unit volume increases, which also proves the successful combination of SiW11Co and CuO. The representative TEM images, as demonstrated in Fig. 2a and b, indicate the pore structure is evenly dispersed in the framework of materials. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was applied to further characterize the microstructure of materials. As Fig. 2c shows, the CuO-2 sample presents the typical spacing of 0.25 and 0.23 nm for the (−111) and the (200) lattice planes of monoclinic CuO. The (101) plane of hexagonal Cu2S with a lattice distance about 0.27 nm is shown in Fig. 2d, indicating the synthesis of Cu2S.

The compositions of the samples were also analyzed by EDAX (Fig. S1, ESI†). The EDAX results indicate the presence of Cu, O, S, Si, W and Co element signals. Simultaneously, elemental mappings of Cu, O, Si, W, Co in CuO-2 and Cu, S, Si, W, Co in Cu2S-2 show the homogeneous distribution of each element (Fig. S2†). Cross-sectional images of CuO-2 and Cu2S-2 films prepared on FTO via silk-screen printing are exhibited in Fig. 3a and b, respectively. From the cross-sectional view, we can see that the film thickness of CuO-2 and Cu2S-2 on FTO is about 3.58 μm and 3.40 μm, respectively. Obviously, the results obtained by SEM, EDAX, TEM and HRTEM all demonstrated the successful synthesis of Cu2S-2 CE material.

Wide-angle X-ray diffraction operated from 15–80° was utilized to further characterize the constitution of samples. The patterns of the precursor (Cu2(OH)2CO3), CuO-X and Cu2S-X (X = 0, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3) are presented in Fig. 4 and Fig. S3.† The peak position of the composite samples is slightly shifted owing to the addition of SiW11Co. Peaks appearing at 32.5°, 35.6°, 38.7°, 48.7°, 61.6° and 65.8° correspond to (110), (−111), (111), (−202), (−113) and (022) of monoclinic CuO (JCPDS:80-1268). Similarly, the patterns for Cu2S with peaks at 26.6°, 29.6°, 46.6°, 54.5° and 74.8° can be indexed to (002), (101), (110), (112) and (114) of hexagonal Cu2S (JCPDS: 72-2276). Hence, the outcomes of XRD clearly indicate the successful preparation of the Cu2S-2 CE materials.

XPS techniques were adopted to verify the composition and element state of the precursor CuO-2 and the product Cu2S-2. The high-resolution XPS patterns of O 1s and Cu 2p in CuO-2 compound are displayed in Fig. 5a. The peaks appearing at 955.1 and 934.9 eV are respectively attributed to Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2, confirming the existence of Cu2+ in the composite. Additionally, the two peaks at 941.6 and 944.7 eV arise from the satellite peak of Cu 2p3/2, and the peak at 962.7 eV corresponds to the satellite peak of Cu 2p1/2, proving the presence of CuO.56 The binding energies at 529.9 and 532.0 eV are both consistent with Cu–O species and surface-chemisorbed hydroxyl group. The spectrum of Cu 2p is shown in Fig. 5b, and the peaks located at 952.0 and 931.3 eV are indexed to Cu 2p1/2 and Cu 2p3/2. No other satellite peaks appear between the two peaks, indicating Cu+ is the unique element in the composite sample. As can be seen from the S 2p spectrum, no peaks appear near 164.0 eV, apart from the peaks at 161.3 and 162.5 eV assigned to S 2p, confirming that no signals of S or S–S bond exist in the products, and the state of S in the complex is S2−.53 Apparently, the W 4f XPS pattern is deconvoluted into two peaks in Fig. 5c. The peaks situated at 33.2 and 35.8 eV are derived from W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2. The high-resolution XPS spectra of Si 2p and Co 2p are also displayed in Fig. 5c and d. The binding energies of 99.1 and 100.2 eV belong to Si 2p3/2 and Si 2p1/2, while the peaks at 782.7 and 784.6 eV are ascribed to Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2, respectively. According to the above analysis, it can be inferred that SiW11Co has successfully combined with CuO and Cu2S. Besides, from the infrared (IR) spectrograms of SiW11Co and CuO-2 in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the fingerprint absorption peaks of Keggin-type POMs appear in the range of 700–1100 cm−1, which further proves the successful doping of SiW11Co. Meanwhile, the survey XPS patterns of CuO-2 and Cu2S-2 in Fig. S5† reveal the element signals of Cu, O, S, Si, W and Co. Based on the above analysis outcomes, the CE material is successfully prepared.

To further verify the microstructure of the materials, N2 sorption test was applied to study the properties of the products at 77 K, and the pore size distribution was calculated according to DFT method. The curves displayed in Fig. 6a clearly show a classic type IV(a) sorption isotherm with a similar-H2(b)-type hysteresis loop, which is mainly caused by the mesh effect. From the pore size distribution curves exhibited in Fig. 6b, we can see the size of the mesopores in the materials is concentrated between 12–30 nm, and the size of nearly 17 nm accounts for the majority. Simultaneously, detailed BET data of different samples are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The BET specific surface areas of CuO and CuO-2 were calculated to be about 40.38 and 54.78 m2 g−1, respectively, proving the addition of SiW11Co makes the material more loose and porous, increases the number of active sites in the composite materials, and increases the contact area between the counter electrode and electrolyte, which may promote the electrocatalytic activity of the counter electrodes. Meanwhile, the pore volume per unit mass amplifies after adding SiW11Co, which may provide efficient transport pathways for electrons from the counter electrode to electrolytes, thus enhancing the electrochemical performance and improving the cell performance.

3.2. Photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs
The QDSSCs assembled with Cu2S, Cu2S-1.5, Cu2S-2, Cu2S-2.5, Cu2S-3, and Cu2S/brass CEs were utilized to study cell photovoltaic performance under AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2. The various current density–voltage (J–V) curves displayed in Fig. 7a all present the outline of a typical J–V curve. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1 and Table S2.† The QDSSC based on the Cu2S-2 CE shows a PCE of 5.94%, which is higher than cells with Cu2S/brass (4.96%) CE possessing similar PCE to Cu2S (4.93%) CE. Apparently, the FF of Cu2S-2 (0.52) is close to Cu2S/brass (0.53), yet the short-circuit current density (Jsc) is significantly increased. With the increasing addition of SiW11Co, the PCE of the cell slowly decreases. The above outcomes demonstrate that the addition of an appropriate amount of SiW11Co can serve as an electron transfer medium, which makes electron transport and collection of the counter electrode more effective and inhibits charge recombination, thereby enhancing the catalytic activity of CEs and the performance of cells.

To continue the study of cell properties, QDSSCs based on various CE materials (Cu2S, Cu2S-2, Cu2S/brass) were fabricated to measure their stability.57 From Fig. 7b, in a certain period of time, the efficiency of the cell with Cu2S-2 CE varies from 5.95% to 5.77%, showing a negligible drop of 3.03% and exhibiting relatively superior stability. The PCE of the Cu2S/brass-based cell changed from 5.00% to 3.60% with a distinct decline of 28%, which is mainly attributed to continuous corrosion of the brass substrate by the polysulfide electrolyte, resulting in film falling and poor stability. Meanwhile, the declining PCE trend of QDSSCs with Cu2S CEs is between those of cells equipped with Cu2S-2 and Cu2S/brass CEs. These consequences clearly indicate that the Cu2S CE prepared by in situ method on FTO using porous sponge-like CuO as the precursor has extremely high stability and elctrocatalytic activity. Simultaneously, the addition of SiW11Co polyoxometalate stabilizes the electron transport in the system, thus improving the efficiency and stability of the cell.
3.3. Electrochemical performance of CEs
EIS is usually applied to explain the internal mechanisms of the electrocatalytic activity of the CEs. It can assist in analyzing the series resistance (Rs) of the device, the diffusion of the electrolyte (Rw) and the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of different parts. Fig. 8a shows the Nyquist plots of different CEs at open-circuit voltage using a symmetrical cell model. The result is obtained via referring to the equivalent circuit diagram in Fig. 8a and fitting by Z-view software. In the high-frequency region semicircle presented in Fig. 8a, the starting point of the semicircle is called series resistance (Rs), and the small semicircle in the high-frequency region represents Rct, which can be used to evaluate the process of charge transfer between the CE and electrolyte. The semicircle in the low-frequency region results from diffusion of the electrolyte and is known as Rw. The relevant fitting parameters of each CE are summarized in Table 2 and Table S3.† A smaller Rs indicates more efficient electron transmission. From Table 2, we can see that Cu2S-2 CE shows a lower Rs (2.134 Ω) than Cu2S/brass (2.511 Ω) and Cu2S (2.542 Ω) CEs. This indicates that the Cu2S CE prepared by in situ method has electrochemical properties close to that of Cu2S/brass CE; however, the doping of SiW11Co further enhances the electron transport capacity and electrocatalytic activity of the CE. Meanwhile, the Cu2S-2 CE shows the lowest Rct value of 0.246 Ω among all CEs. In general, Rct is negatively correlated with the electrocatalytic performance of the counter electrode, and a smaller Rct means that Cu2S-2 CE has higher electrocatalytic activity and conductivity. The suitable energy-band matching between SiW11Co (−4.25 eV, AVS) and Cu2S (−4.44 eV, AVS) optimizes the electron transport process at the interface of the CE, thereby improving the catalytic performance of the electrode and the performance of the cell. The Bode phase diagrams of different counter electrodes are shown in Fig. 8b. We can calculate the average electron lifetime (τe) by the equation τe = (2πfmax)−1.58 The corresponding calculation outcomes are listed in Table 2 and Table S3.† Distinctly, the introduction of an appropriate amount of SiW11Co results in a longer electron lifetime, thereby strengthening the electrochemical properties of the CEs.

Tafel polarization curves were measured at variable potential to further assess the electrocatalytic behavior of the various CEs. The Tafel plot is universally broken up into three regions, as depicted in Fig. 8c. Nevertheless, the relevant parameters of the Tafel zone (J0) and the diffusion zone (Jlim) are essential to characterize the electrochemical activity of the CEs. The area with a steep slope is regarded as Tafel area; the exchange current-density (J0) can be obtained in this zone by the intersection point of the cathode branch and zero potential, which is closely related to Rct, as described in the formula J0 = RT/nFRct (where R is gas constant, T (K) is temperature, F is Faraday constant and n is the number of electrons corresponding to the electrolyte reduction process). In addition, the limiting current-density (Jlim) can be gained in the diffusion zone, which tends to show a horizontal trend. As displayed in Fig. 8c, compared with other CEs, Cu2S-2 CE shows a relatively high value of Jlim. The J0 value of Cu2S-2 CE is higher than those of the remaining CEs, which is in keeping with the EIS and OCVD parameters. The detailed analysis results are presented in Table 2 and Table S3.† Consequently, according to the consequences of Tafel, we can conclude the Cu2S CE fabricated by in situ method has comparable catalytic activity to Cu2S/brass CE, whereas the electrochemical properties of Cu2S-2 CE were greatly improved due to the proper addition of SiW11Co. To further characterize the kinetics of carrier recombination in QDSSCs assembled with different CEs, the open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) test was executed. The curves displayed in Fig. 8d show the QDSSC with Cu2S-2 CE decay is slower than others, proving the longer electron lifetime and lower charge recombination rate in the cell, which is conducive to improving device efficiency.59 Furthermore, when the amount of polyoxometallate increases to a certain value, the voltage decays faster, resulting in a shorter electron lifetime, which further confirms that the content of SiW11Co in Cu2S-2 enables the PCE of the cell to achieve the optimal value.
The stability of the CE in the polysulfide electrolyte is indispensible for practical application of the device, eventually affecting the cell performance. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) test was conducted to evaluate the stability of CEs. In Fig. S6,† after several cycles, the current value of Cu2S/brass dropped significantly compared to the Cu2S and Cu2S-2 CEs, which is consistent with the results in Fig. 7b. Furthermore, Cu2S-2 CE has a higher reduction peak current value than Cu2S/brass and Cu2S CEs, which coincides with the results of Tafel and EIS measurements. Therefore, our proposed method of preparing Cu2S CE with porous sponge-like CuO as a precursor solves the problem of continuous corrosion of brass by the polysulfide electrolyte, thus enhancing the stability of the CE and the PCE of the cell.
4. Conclusions
We proposed the first application of a porous sponge-like CuO electrode as a precursor to prepare an efficient Cu2S CE on FTO in situ, which showed outstanding electrochemical behaviors and prominent stability. Cu2S CE was synthesized by a simple calcining and in situ sulfidation method using porous sponge-like CuO as precursor. Besides, the addition of an appropriate amount of SiW11Co makes the collection and transfer of electrons more effective, inhibiting charge recombination and improving the cell performance. The performance parameters of the cell revealed a PCE of 5.94% was received by assembling QDSSC with Cu2S-2 CE, which is 20% more efficient than that with Cu2S/brass CE. The tests of BET, EIS, CV, Tafel, and OCVD all indicated the novel Cu2S-2 CE possesses super electrocatalytic activity and conductivity. Hence, the Cu2S-2 CE prepared by this method can be utilized as a promising CE for QDSSCs. The method reported in this article is economical, facile, time-saving and eco-friendly, combining the excellent catalytic characteristic of Cu2S with the stability and conductivity of FTO. This study proposes new ideas for the preparation of Cu2S CE and applies the superior electron transport characteristics of the eco-friendly polyoxometalates to the QDSSC system, making it possible to fabricate highly efficient counter electrode materials for QDSSCs.
