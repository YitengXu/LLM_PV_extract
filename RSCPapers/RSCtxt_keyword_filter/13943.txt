BiSI is formed under low S/Bi mole ratio conditions but it easily converts to Bi13S18I2 under high S/Bi mole ratio conditions. Bi13S18I2 is an n-type semiconductor with a narrow bandgap of 0.75 eV and exhibits a strong light absorbance in the wide wavelength range from UV to NIR, making it a promising light absorber material for solar cells.

A Bi13S18I2-based solar cell has demonstrated a power conversion efficiency of 0.85% for the first time, revealing the potential of Bi13S18I2 as a new type of light absorber material for solar cells which can be fabricated via a low-cost solution process.
Introduction
As the global demand for energy is expected to grow rapidly, securing clean energy is essential for sustainable economic growth. Solar energy is the most promising clean energy source for the next-generation.1,2 At present, the photovoltaic (PV) market is dominated by crystalline silicon panels which exhibit relatively high efficiency, but their high cost has prompted the development of low cost high performance PVs.3 Some new types of PVs, such as thin film type CuIn1−xGaxSe2 (CIGS) and CdTe PVs, have been developed to reduce the cost and increase the power conversion efficiency (PCE). Although the PCEs of these PVs have recently reached 22%, their potential and future prospects are limited by the high cost of indium and the scarcity of tellurium.4,5
Recently, Pb-based hybrid halide perovskites, such as CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI), have attracted much attention as promising solar light absorbers for PV due to their high PCE and the low cost of the solution fabrication process.6,7 Although they were first reported only 10 years ago, the PCE of PVs using a hybrid perovskite as a light absorber has reached 24.2%,8 surpassing all other third-generation PVs, and this fast-growing PCE is a new record in the history of PV technology.9 Unfortunately, in addition to humidity and thermal instability, Pb-based hybrid halide perovskites pose a potential environmental risk due to leaching of toxic Pb.10–12 In order to solve these problems, there is an urgent need to explore alternative light absorber materials consisting of nontoxic elements. The substitution of Pb(II) with Bi(III) in the hybrid perovskites is attractive because both Bi(III) and Pb(II) have the same 6s26p0 electronic configuration, thus ensuring that their compounds will share similar properties. Some studies have suggested that Bi-based hybrid perovskites are promising as PV light absorbers, but successful synthesis of Bi-based hybrid perovskites has not been reported.13–16 Non-toxic bismuth-halide double perovskites A3Bi2X9 (A = Cs+, Ag, CH3NH3+ and HC(NH2)2+; X = I−, Br−, Cl−) have been much investigated and employed for solar cells,16 just exhibiting a PCE of 3.2% up to now.17
Recently, some V–VI–VII compounds (V = Sb, Bi; VI = O, S, Se; VII = Cl, Br, I) have attracted much attention as potential electronic materials. These compounds exhibit a variety of physical characteristics, including high photoconductivity, ferroelectric photovoltaic effects,18 piezoelectricity, electrooptical effects,19,20 and structural diversity.13,14 BiSX compounds have attracted significant attention as PV materials because of their excellent semiconducting properties and narrow bandgaps, which can absorb the solar spectrum over a wide wavelength range.21,22 Another important advantage is that their bandgaps are tunable by substitution of halide each other, such as BiSBr1−xIx solid solutions.23 Recently, Hahn et al. described a solar cell using a BiSI semiconductor thin film as a lighter-absorber, which yielded a PCE of 0.25%.24 Tiwari et al. described a BiSI-based solar cell with a record PCE of 1.32% by employing a p-type organic semiconductor as a hole transport material.25 BiOX compounds possess tunable bandgaps from 3.46 eV for BiOCl to 1.77 eV for BiOI, and exhibit superior photocatalytic activities.21,26 BiSX compounds are synthesized generally using a vapor transport process at high temperatures above 400 °C in a vacuum tube.27 BiSI can also be obtained through a solvothermal process and a melt growth process by the Bridgman–Stockbarger technique.20,28
Fewer studies have been reported on Bi19S27X3 (X = Cl, Br, I) compounds. Traditionally, these bismuth sulfohalogenides are synthesized using a vapor transport process and flux process under high temperature conditions over 600 °C.29,30 A solvothermal process has also been employed to obtain Bi19S27X3 nanocrystals.31–33 The Bi19S27Br3 and Bi19S27Cl3 nanocrystals exhibit efficient photocatalytic degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol and the reduction of Cr(VI).32,33 The characteristics and structure of Bi19S27I3 remain unclear. Ho et al. reported that this compound possesses an indirect bandgap of 0.73 eV and a direct bandgap of 1.08 eV.30 However, Groom et al. reported that this compound is an indirect bandgap semiconductor based on the single crystal structure study and electronic structure calculations; furthermore, the result also revealed that this compound can be expressed as a new composition formula of Bi13S18I2.29 Very recently, Yan et al. fabricated a Bi19S27I3 nanorod cluster film through a solvothermal process and applied the film to a photodetector.34 However, to the best of our knowledge, Bi13S18I2-based solar cells have not been reported yet.
Herein, we report a facile solvothermal process for the synthesis of bismuth chalcogenide iodides Bi13S18I2 and BiSI and systematic characterization of their photoelectric behavior as light absorbers for solar cells. A possible formation mechanism for Bi13S18I2 and BiSI under the solvothermal conditions is proposed. Both Bi13S18I2 and BiSI are n-type semiconductors with bandgaps of 0.75 and 1.57 eV, respectively. We modified the solvothermal process to fabricate a Bi13S18I2 nanorod film on a porous TiO2 nanocrystal film for a new type of Bi13S18I2-based solar cell. A preliminary PV study gave a PCE of 0.85%, suggesting the potential of Bi13S18I2-based solar cells which can be fabricated by a low-cost solution process.
Experimental details
Chemicals and reagents
Hydroiodic acid (HI, 57% in water) and BiI3 (98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. CH4N2S (99.0%) was purchased from TCI chemicals and ethylene glycol, acetone and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were bought from Wako Chemicals. All chemicals and reagents were analytical grade and used as received.
Synthesis of bismuth chalcogenide iodide powder samples
CH3NH3I (MAI) was synthesized by reaction of 24 mL of methylamine with 10 mL of HI solution at 0 °C for 2 h in a rotary evaporator at 120 rpm, and then evaporated at 80 °C. The precipitate was washed three times with ethanol and then diethyl ether at room temperature and then dried at 60 °C for 24 h. For the synthesis of a bismuth chalcogenide iodide powder sample, BiI3 (2 mmol), MAI (3 mmol), and a desired amount of CH4N2S were added into 5 mL of ethylene glycol solvent. The mixture was solvothermally treated at a desired temperature for 12 h under stirring conditions. The obtained sample was filtered, washed with ethanol, and dried in a drying oven at 60 °C for 12 h.
Fabrication of bismuth chalcogenide iodide pellet samples
The synthesized bismuth chalcogenide iodide powder sample was gently ground into fine powder. This powder sample was then pressed using a pellet press mold with a diameter of 10 mm at 30 MPa for 3 min. Subsequently, cold isostatic press (CIP) treatment was employed on the pellet sample with a pressure of 200 MPa for 5 min to increase sample density. The thickness of the pellet was about 1 mm.
Fabrication of a TiO2 electrode
A TiO2 nanocrystal paste was prepared by mixing a P25 TiO2 nanocrystal sample (0.5 g), ethanol (2.5 g), α-terpineol (2.0 g), a 10 wt% solution of ethyl-cellulose 10 (1.4 g), and a 10 wt% solution of ethyl-cellulose 45 (1.1 g). The mixture was dispersed by ultrasonication for 30 min and then ball-milling for 72 h. After ball-milling, the ethanol was removed from the mixture using a rotary evaporator.35
The TiO2 electrode was prepared in the following manner.36 A fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass plate was cleaned in distilled water and acetone by ultrasonication for 10 min, consecutively. Then the FTO glass plate was dipped in 0.1 M titanium tetraisopropoxide (TTIP) solution for 1 min and washed with distilled water and ethanol, dried at room temperature, and calcined at 480 °C for 1 h to coat the FTO glass surface with a dense TiO2 thin film. The prepared TiO2 paste was then coated on the dense TiO2 thin film on the FTO glass plate by a screen printing technique and dried at 120 °C for 10 min. This process was repeated to obtain a TiO2 nanocrystal film with about 10 μm thickness. After the TiO2 paste coating, the TiO2 film was calcined at 450 °C for 30 min to obtain a TiO2 nanoporous electrode. The TiO2 nanoporous electrode was dipped in the 0.1 M TTIP solution for 1 min, washed with distilled water and ethanol, dried at room temperature, and calcined at 480 °C for 1 h again.
Fabrication of a Bi13S18I2 film on the TiO2 electrode
0.4 mmol BiI3 (0.2359 g), 0.6 mmol MAI (0.0954 g), and 1.6 mmol CH4N2S (1.2179 g) were dissolved in 1 mL ethylene glycol solvent by stirring for 1 h, and then a red BiI3–MAI–CH4N2S mixed solution was obtained. The mixed solution was coated on the TiO2 nanoporous electrode surface. After being allowed to stand for 2 h, the coated TiO2 nanoporous electrode was placed on a shelf set in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with an internal volume of 80 mL. After adding 1 mL ethylene glycol solvent to the autoclave bottom, the autoclave was sealed and solvothermally treated at 195 °C for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, a black Bi13S18I2-coated TiO2 electrode was obtained. The Bi13S18I2-coated TiO2 electrode was washed with ethanol and dried at 60 °C for 12 h in a drying oven.
Fabrication and characterization of solar cells
A Bi13S18I2-solar cell was comprised of the Bi13S18I2-coated TiO2 electrode as an anode, Pt-coated FTO glass as a cathode, and an electrolyte solution between the anode and the cathode. The electrolyte solution contained 0.1 M LiI, 0.01 M I2, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 0.4 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), and 0.1 M guanidine thiocyanate (GT) in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (v/v = 85:15). The photocurrent–voltage characteristic curve for the Bi13S18I2-solar cell was measured using a Hokuto-Denko BAS100B electrochemical analyzer under irradiation with AM 1.5 simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2), using a sunlight simulator (YSS-E40, Yamashita Denso). A light-passing mask was fixed on the surface of the FTO glass of the anode to set the effective irradiation area on the cell at 0.25 cm2.
Physical analysis
The crystal structures of the samples were investigated using a powder X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu, model XRD-6100) with Cu Kα (λ = 0.1542 nm) radiation. The morphologies of the samples were observed using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) (JEOL, ISM-7001F) and their chemical compositions were measured using an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX) attached to the FE-SEM at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) observations were performed on a JEOL Model JEM-3010 system at 300 kV. Mott–Schottky plots were measured using an electrochemical analyzer (Shanghai Chenhua, CHI660E). Ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) absorption spectra were obtained on a Shimadzu SolidSpec-3700 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer at room temperature. The TG-DTA analysis was carried out using a thermal analyzer (Shimadzu, DTG-60H) at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. For the conductivity measurement, a voltage of 100 V was applied to the pellet sample, and the current was measured using a ferroelectric testing system (Toyo Corporation, FCE3-4KVSYS) at room temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a Kratos Axis Supra X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. The XPS spectra were calibrated to an adventitious carbon peak at 284.8 eV.
Results and discussion
Solvothermal synthesis of bismuth chalcogenide iodide compounds
The bismuth chalcogenide iodide compounds Bi13S18I2 and BiSI were synthesized by solvothermal treatment of a mixture of BiI3, CH4N2S, and CH3NH3I (MAI) in an ethylene glycol solvent. The formation of the bismuth chalcogenide iodide compounds is strongly dependent on the CH4N2S/BiI3/MAI mole ratio and reaction temperature. Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the samples synthesized under conditions of different CH4N2S/BiI3 mole ratios at 195 °C, where the BiI3/MAI mole ratio was fixed at 2:3. In this reaction system, the iodine amount was excessive for the formation of Bi13S18I2 and BiSI because the Bi/S/I mole ratios are 13:18:2 in Bi13S18I2 and 1:1:1 in BiSI. The XRD pattern of the sample prepared at a CH4N2S/BiI3 mole ratio of 1:2 can be well indexed to an orthorhombic BiSI phase with space group Pnma and lattice constants a = 0.8519, b = 1.0177 and c = 0.4172 nm (JCPDS File No. 73-1171). By increasing the CH4N2S/BiI3 mole ratio, the Bi13S18I2 phase (JCPDS File No. 73-1157) was formed and became the main phase with a small amount of metal Bi phase at CH4N2S/BiI3 = 3:2, and then a single Bi13S18I2 phase was formed at CH4N2S/BiI3 = 4:2. The structure of the Bi13S18I2 phase belongs to a hexagonal system with space group P63 and lattice parameters a = 1.5612 and c = 0.4017 nm.29 When the CH4N2S/BiI3 mole ratio was increased to 8:2, the Bi13S18I2 phase disappeared, where a Bi2S3 single phase was formed. The above results reveal that the products are sensitive to the Bi/S mole ratio in this solvothermal reaction system.

To provide a phase diagram for the BiI3–CH4N2S–MAI solvothermal reaction system, the solvothermal treatments were carried out at different temperatures and the XRD patterns of the products are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Based on the XRD results, the phase diagram for the BiI3–CH4N2S–MAI solvothermal reaction system was obtained as shown in Fig. 2. BiSI is preferably formed in a low S/Bi mole ratio range below 1.5, namely Area-A. By increasing the S/Bi mole ratio, a mixture of BiSI, Bi13S18I2, a small amount of metal Bi, and an unknown phase is formed in Area-B. A single Bi13S18I2 phase can be obtained in Area-C. By further increasing the S/Bi mole ratio, Bi2S3 is formed in Area-D, and a Bi2S3 single phase is formed in Area-E, suggesting that Bi13S18I2 is unstable under the high S/Bi mole ratio conditions in the BiI3–CH4N2S–MAI solvothermal reaction system.

We also tried to synthesize bismuth chalcogenide iodide compounds in other solvents, such as acetone, DMF, and DMSO. The XRD patterns of the solvothermal products prepared at a CH4N2S/BiI3/MAI mole ratio of 4:2:3 (S/Bi = 2:1) and at 195 °C are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Although a single Bi13S18I2 phase can be formed in acetone solvent, the yield of Bi13S18I2 is disappointing, due to its low reactivity in this solvent. In the DMF solvent, a mixture of a Bi13S18I2 phase and a metal Bi phase is formed. However, an unknown phase without Bi13S18I2 is formed in the DMSO solvent. These results suggest that the solvothermal formations of bismuth chalcogenide iodine compounds are sensitive to the solvents. Compared with the high temperature reaction process,29,30 the solvothermal process described above is a facile method for the synthesis of bismuth chalcogenide iodide compounds.
FE-SEM was employed to investigate the morphologies of the products obtained by the solvothermal reaction and the results for the samples prepared at 195 °C are shown in Fig. 3 The sample obtained at a CH4N2S/BiI3 mole ratio of 1:2 possesses a fibrous particle morphology with a diameter of about 500 nm and a length of about 20 μm (Fig. 3(a)). The fibrous particles correspond to BiSI because this sample is a BiSI single phase (Fig. 1(a)). Fibrous particles and urchin-like particles were observed in the sample of mixed BiSI and Bi13S18I2 phases obtained at a CH4N2S/BiI3 mole ratio of 2:2 (Fig. 3(b)), where the fibrous particles can be attributed to the BiSI phase and the urchin-like particles to the Bi13S18I2 phase (Fig. 1(b)). The Bi13S18I2 single phase sample obtained at a CH4N2S/BiI3 mole ratio of 4:2 exhibits a rod-like particle morphology with a diameter of about 400 nm and a length of about 5 μm (Fig. 3(c)). The Bi2S3 single phase sample obtained at a CH4N2S/BiI3 mole ratio of 8:2 shows fibrous and rod-like particle morphologies (Fig. 3(d)).

Bi13S18I2 possesses an interesting structure, as shown in Fig. 4(a).27 In this structure, ribbon-like subunits of [Bi4S6] form six spokes around a central hexagonal channel at the corners of the unit cell. The [Bi4S6]-ribbon spokes are connected together to form a triangular tunnel structure in the c-axial direction, with I− located in the tunnel site of the Bi13S18I2 structure. TEM and HRTEM results revealed that the rod-like Bi13S18I2 particles were single crystals, where the rod-like crystal axis direction corresponds to [001] (Fig. S3, ESI†); in other words, Bi13S18I2 crystals grow in the c-axial direction. Zhou et al. proposed that such a ribbon structural geometry can exhibit a high conductivity along the covalently bonded [Bi4S6]-ribbon direction, i.e., the direction of the c-axis, which can increase the conductivity and reduce charge recombination in absorbers of solar cells.37

In the BiSI structure, a double chain subunit of [(BiSI)2] is formed by linking Bi with S and I together by strong Bi–S and Bi–I bonds along the c-axis direction, and the [(BiSI)2]-chains are held together by weak van der Waals type bonds, as shown in Fig. 4(b).38 TEM and HRTEM results reveal that rod-like BiSI particles were also single crystals and the rod-like crystals grew along the c-axial direction in a similar manner to the Bi13S18I2 structure (Fig. S3, ESI†).
Formation reactions of bismuth chalcogenide iodide compounds
A BiI3–CH4N2S–MAI mixed solution with a CH4N2S/BiI3/MAI mole ratio of 2:4:3 was solvothermally treated at 195 °C for different reaction times to investigate the formation process of bismuth chalcogenide iodide compounds. XRD results indicate that a binary mixture of BiSI and Bi13S18I2 was formed after the reaction for 0.5 h (Fig. 5). By prolonging the reaction time, the fraction of BiSI decreased and that of Bi13S18I2 increased, then the BiSI disappeared completely after 6 h reaction, and finally a Bi13S18I2 single phase was formed after 12 h reaction. This result suggests that first BiSI is formed, which then converts to Bi13S18I2 under the solvothermal reaction conditions.
 Fig. 5  XRD patterns of products synthesized by solvothermal treatments of a solution with a CH4N2S/BiI3/MAI mole ratio of 4:2:3 at 195 °C for (a) 0.5, (b) 1, (c) 2, (d) 4, (e) 6, and (f) 12 h, respectively. 
The conversion reaction of BiSI to Bi13S18I2 was investigated by FE-SEM observation (Fig. 6(A)). In the sample obtained after 0.5 h reaction, large fibrous particles and small urchin-like particles were observed simultaneously. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis reveals that the large fibrous particles and small urchin-like particles have element compositions close to the stoichiometric compositions of BiSI (Bi/S/I = 1:1:1) and Bi13S18I2 (Bi/S/I = 13:18:2), respectively (Fig. S4 and Table S1, ESI†); that is to say, they correspond to the BiSI phase and the Bi13S18I2 phase, respectively. By increasing the reaction time up to 4 h, the urchin-like Bi13S18I2 particles grew up and their fraction in the product increased, accompanying the consumption of the fibrous BiSI particles. After 6 h reaction, the urchin-like Bi13S18I2 particles became rod-like in shape and the fibrous BiSI particles disappeared completely. This reaction process can be confirmed by the element composition analysis results of SEM-EDS in Fig. S4 and Table S1 (ESI†), and also corresponds to the XRD results in Fig. 5.

Based on the results described above, we deduced a reaction mechanism for the formation of BiSI and Bi13S18I2 in the solvothermal reaction system, as shown in Fig. 6(B). In the first step, S2− is formed by the decomposition reaction of CH4N2S under solvothermal conditions and then BiSI is formed by the solution reaction between Bi(III), S2− and I−, resulting in fibrous BiSI particles. In the second step, crystal nuclei of Bi13S18I2 are formed on the surfaces of the fibrous BiSI particles (Fig. 6(A)(a)) and then they grow up into small urchin-like Bi13S18I2 particles through a BiSI-dissolution reaction and a Bi13S18I2-deposition reaction. In the third step, the small urchin-like Bi13S18I2 particles further grow up and finally collapse, becoming individual rod-like Bi13S18I2 particles through the BiSI-dissolution reaction and the Bi13S18I2-deposition reaction. Thus, the BiSI phase is converted to the Bi13S18I2 phase in this reaction system.
Characterization of bismuth chalcogenide iodide compounds
It has been reported that BiSI can be used as a light absorber for solar cells.4 In the present study, therefore, we investigated the thermostabilities and photoelectric properties of Bi13S18I2 and BiSI to evaluate the potential of Bi13S18I2 as a light absorber for a new type of solar cell. The Bi13S18I2 and BiSI samples synthesized by solvothermal treatment of the CH4N2S–BiI3–MAI mixed solution with CH4N2S/BiI3/MAI mole ratios of 4:2:3 and 1:2:3 at 195 °C for 12 h, respectively, were used for the characterization. The TG-DTA analysis and XRD results (Fig. S5 and S6, ESI†) suggest that Bi13S18I2 is stable up to 350 °C, decomposes to BiOI at around 380 °C and finally to Bi2O3 at above 500 °C. Similar to Bi13S18I2, BiSI is stable up to 400 °C, decomposes to BiOI at around 400 °C and finally to Bi2O3 at above 500 °C (Fig. S5 and S6, ESI†). BiSI exhibits a slightly higher thermostability than Bi13S18I2 in air.
The pellet samples of Bi13S18I2 and BiSI were used for the conductivity measurement at room temperature (Fig. S7, ESI†). The electrical conductivity (σ) was calculated from the applied voltage (V), the measured current (I), the thickness of the pellet sample (L), and the area (S) of the pellet sample using formula (1). (1)The calculated electrical conductivity of the Bi13S18I2 pellet sample is 8.85 × 10−7 S cm−1, which is much lower than the reported value of 9 × 10−4 S cm−1 for a single crystal sample.30 The lower conductivity of the Bi13S18I2 pellet sample can be attributed to the low density of the pellet sample and the grain boundaries because of the rod-like particle morphology of Bi13S18I2, which can be confirmed in its FE-SEM image (Fig. S8, ESI†). The BiSI pellet sample has an electrical conductivity of 6.24 × 10−7 S cm−1.
The Bi13S18I2 and BiSI samples are black crystals. The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of Bi13S18I2 and BiSI are shown in Fig. 7A. A strong and broad absorption peak around 500 nm in the visible light wavelength range and another strong peak at 1115 nm in the near-IR wavelength range were observed in the Bi13S18I2 absorption spectrum. A strong flat absorbance in the wavelength range of 300 to 800 nm was observed in the BiSI absorption spectrum. The absorption spectral findings reveal that Bi13S18I2 has a smaller bandgap energy than BiSI and is a promising light absorber for solar cells.

The bandgap energy (Eg) of a semiconductor can be estimated using Tauc's formula (Ahν)1/n = B(hν − Eg), where A, B, and hν are the absorption coefficient, a constant, and the incident photon energy, and the exponent n is equal to 1/2 or 2 for the allowed direct or indirect transition, respectively.39 Because Bi13S18I2 and BiSI are indirect semiconductors,29,38,40 Tauc's formula can be represented as the Kubelka–Munk function A = C(hν − Eg)2/hν, where C is the absorption constant.19,41 The bandgap energy can be estimated from the transformed Kubelka–Munk function versus the photon energy (Fig. 7(b) and (d)). The estimated bandgap energy of the Bi13S18I2 sample was 0.75 eV by extrapolating the straight line to zero absorption intercepting the (hν) axis. It can be noticed that the absorption does not fall to zero at 0.75 eV, which suggests that the true bandgap may be lower than 0.75 eV as Groom et al. reported.29 The bandgap value corresponds to that reported by Ho et al.30 Yan et al. reported a direct band gap of 0.83 eV, which is slightly larger than our result.34 The BiSI sample has a bandgap energy of 1.57 eV, which agrees with reported values of 1.57–1.59 eV.4,22,40
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the surface valence states and the chemical compositions of the Bi13S18I2 and BiSI samples. The XPS survey spectrum reveals the predominant presence of sulfur, bismuth and iodine, as well as small amounts of carbon and oxygen impurities in both Bi13S18I2 and BiSI samples (Fig. S9, ESI†). The carbon and oxygen may correspond to the residual organic precursor and adsorbed oxygen molecules on the particle surface. The Bi spin–orbit doublet peaks of BiSI are consistent with the XPS result of BiSI reported by Grigas et al., where all Bi atoms are trivalent in BiSI.42 The Bi-4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 peaks were observed at 158.7 and 164.0 eV for BiSI and at 158.0 and 163.3 eV for Bi13S18I2. The different binding energies between Bi13S18I2 and BiSI may account for the existence of bivalent Bi(II) in Bi13S18I2. It has been reported that the bivalent Bi(II) as Bi24+ dimers is possible in Bi13S18I2, which results in the formation of (Bi3+)12(Bi24+)0.5(S2−)18(I−)2 rather than Bi19S27I3 or (Bi(Bi2S3)9I3)2/3.29 The XPS result indicates that the I/Bi/S atomic ratio in the Bi13S18I2 sample is 1:6.5:8.9, which is very close to the stoichiometric mole ratio of 1:6.5:9.0 of (Bi3+)12(Bi24+)0.5(S2−)18(I−)2. A single peak of S-2s was observed at 225.0 and 225.2 eV for Bi13S18I2 and BiSI, respectively. The I-3d3/2 and I-3d5/2 spin–orbit spin components were observed at 630.1 and 618.6 eV for Bi13S18I2 and 630.2 and 618.7 eV for BiSI, respectively. The binding energies of S-2s, I-3d3/2 and I-3d5/2 of Bi13S18I2 are very close to those of BiSI.

Fig. 8 shows the valence-band spectra of Bi13S18I2 and BiSI. The valence band maximum is located at 0.61 and 0.89 eV below the Fermi level for Bi13S18I2 and BiSI, respectively. Therefore, the conduction band minimum of Bi13S18I2 will be located at 0.14 eV above the Fermi level because the band gap of Bi13S18I2 is 0.75 eV. As the Femi level is close to the conduction band minimum, Bi13S18I2 should be an n-type semiconductor.43 This is different from the result that Bi13S18I2 is a p-type semiconductor based on a hot-probe measurement result.30 The n-type and p-type semiconductors can be distinguished also by Mott–Schottky plots, where the n-type semiconductor shows a positive slope value and the p-type semiconductor shows a negative slope value.44 The Mott–Schottky plot of Bi13S18I2 shows a positive slope value, as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†); namely, it is an n-type semiconductor.

There is also an argument about whether Bi13S18I2 is an indirect bandgap semiconductor or a direct bandgap semiconductor.29,30 These arguments suggest that the properties of Bi13S18I2 are strongly dependent on its synthesis conditions, maybe slightly different in the chemical composites, due to the formation of a bivalent [Bi2]4+ dimer. Therefore, Bi13S18I2 may be a tunable semiconducting material. On the other hand, the conduction band minimum of BiSI will be located at 0.68 eV above the Fermi level because its bandgap energy is 1.57 eV. Therefore, BiSI should also be an n-type semiconductor because the Femi level was close to the conduction band minimum, which is agreement with the results reported.4
Solar cell performance of Bi13S18I2 as a light absorber
Bi13S18I2 holds promise as a light absorber for solar cells because it exhibits strong light absorption in the whole visible light wavelength range as shown in Fig. 8(a). However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has been reported on the application of Bi13S18I2 as a light absorber for solar cells. Therefore, we carried out a preliminary PV study using Bi13S18I2 as a light absorber to confirm its possibility. First, Bi13S18I2 solar cells with a cell structure as shown in Fig. 9(a) were fabricated. In the solar cell, a TiO2 dense film was coated on the surface of FTO conducting glass as a hole blocking layer and a TiO2 porous film was coated on the TiO2 dense film. A Bi13S18I2 film was fabricated on the TiO2 porous film using a modified solvothermal process. An electrolyte solution of an I3−/I− redox couple was used as a hole-transporting material and a Pt-coated FTO conducting glass was used as a counter-electrode similar to dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).
 Fig. 9  (a) Schematic illustration of a Bi13S18I2-based solar cell structure and (b) I–V curves of eight Bi13S18I2-based solar cells. 
The FE-SEM images of an FTO/TiO2/Bi13S18I2 electrode reveal that the thickness of the porous TiO2 film was about 10 μm (Fig. 10(a)). A uniform black Bi13S18I2 film was formed on the porous TiO2 film after solvothermal treatment (Fig. 10(d)). Rod-like Bi13S18I2 nanocrystals were formed in the nanopores and the surface of the porous TiO2 film (Fig. 10(b and c)). The diameters of the Bi13S18I2 nanorods in the nanopores were about 50 nm, which are slightly smaller than those on the surface, indicating that the crystal size in the nanopores is controlled by the pore size.

Fig. 9(b) shows the photocurrent–voltage (I–V) characteristic curves of eight solar cells under a simulated AM 1.5 spectrum. The cell performance parameters, i.e. the energy conversion efficiency (η), short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF), evaluated from the I–V curves are summarised in Table S2 (ESI†). These cells exhibited η, Jsc, Voc, and FF values in the ranges of 0.53 to 0.85%, 3.22 to 3.82 mA cm−2, 0.51 to 0.58 V, and 29.3 to 38.3%, respectively. The relatively high repeatability of the cell performance can be attributed to the high stability of Bi13S18I2. The highest η value is 0.85% with cell parameters Jsc = 3.82 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.58 V, and FF = 38.3%. Although the PCEs of these preliminary solar cells are still low, these results reveal the potential of Bi13S18I2 as a light absorber for photovoltaics and photoelectric devices. The low PCE can be attributed mainly to low Jsc and FF values of the cell. Many factors, such as the cell structure, the thicknesses of the Bi13S18I2 and TiO2 films, and the crystallinity of Bi13S18I2, and the hole-transporting material, can affect the Jsc and FF values. The optimization of these factors will further improve the solar cell performance. Moreover, the Bi13S18I2 band gap of 0.75 eV is smaller than the ideal bandgap of 1.4 eV for a single p–n junction solar cell,45 which also limits the maximum PCE value. To provide precise evaluation of the ultimate potential of Bi13S18I2 as a light absorber for photovoltaics, further detailed studies, such as its lifetime, photoluminescence quantum efficiency, and Urbach energy, are expected.
Conclusions
The solvothermal process is a facile method for the synthesis of bismuth chalcogenide iodide compounds Bi13S18I2 and BiSI. The formations of Bi13S18I2 and BiSI are strongly dependent on the S/Bi mole ratio, reaction temperature, and solvent. BiSI can be formed under low S/Bi mole ratio conditions, but it is unstable and easily converts to Bi13S18I2 under high S/Bi mole ratio conditions. Both Bi13S18I2 and BiSI have similar rod-like crystal morphologies due to their ribbon-like and chain structures. Bi13S18I2 is an n-type semiconductor with a narrow bandgap of 0.75 eV. The strong light absorbance of Bi13S18I2 in a wide wavelength range from UV to NIR suggests that it is a promising light absorber material for solar cells. A uniform Bi13S18I2 nanorod film can be fabricated on a porous TiO2 electrode by a modified solvothermal process. A preliminary PV study demonstrates a PCE of 0.85%, revealing the potential of the Bi13S18I2 light absorber for a new type of solar cell that can be fabricated by a low-cost solution process.
