    , Accepted 30th October 2017First published on 1st November 2017AbstractIn this paper, we synthesized mixed-cation [HC(NH2)2]x[CH3NH3]1−xPbI3 (FAxMA1−xPbI3) (x = 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2) perovskite nanostructures through a simple solution method. The morphology and crystal structure of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 nanostructures are measured by field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). The temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) of FAxMA1−xPbI3 nanostructures is investigated; the integrated PL intensity exhibits an exponential decrease with the increase of temperature. An abnormal redshift of the center PL emission wavelength due to orthorhombic–tetragonal phase transition in the transitional temperature region around 150 K is observed from the temperature-dependent PL; the center PL emission wavelength shows continuous blue-shift in the pure orthorhombic phase and tetragonal phase. In addition, the exciton binding energy of FAxMA1−xPbI3 nanostructures was obtained by analysing the PL intensity decay. The exciton binding energy decreases when the FA/MA ratio approaches 1:1. The low Urbach energy of ∼25 meV was fitted from the absorption spectra. These results on optical properties indicate the advantage of FAxMA1−xPbI3 in solar cell devices.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite materials are particularly promising power conversion materials for solar cells. Since their first report in 2009, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has increased from 3.8% to 22.1%;1–6 therefore organic–inorganic hybrid halide lead iodide perovskites attract tremendous attention in the field of photovoltaic devices. Among these different perovskite solar cell materials, methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) (MAPbI3) and formamidium lead iodide ([HC(NH2)2]PbI3) (FAPbI3) are the most important materials. MAPbI3 is widely used as light harvester in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to its optical band gap of ∼1.6 eV, large light absorption coefficient, long carrier lifetime and long carrier diffusion length. However, a major challenge of a high performance MAPbI3 solar cell is its stability, including thermal stability and moisture sensitivity. MAPbI3 undergoes a reversible phase transition between tetragonal and cubic symmetry phase,7 and the phase transition temperature is 55 °C which can be easily reached for solar cell devices working under sunshine. In addition, MAPbI3 can easily decompose around 100 °C. Recently, trigonal phase perovskite α-FAPbI3 is regarded as an alternative perovskite material due to its narrower band gap ∼1.48 eV and higher decomposition temperature than that of MAPbI3. However, FAPbI3 usually shows yellow non-perovskite hexagonal δ-FAPbI3 phase at room temperature, and the black α-FAPbI3 perovskite trigonal phase can only be obtained by inducing the phase transition of δ-FAPbI3 at 160 °C.7
Recently, the researchers found that mixed-cation FAxMA1−xPbI3 can stabilize at the cubic perovskite phase even at room temperature. When MA+ in MAPbI3 is replaced by larger radius FA+ to realize mixed-cation FAxMA1−xPbI3, the bandgap can be decreased from 1.57 eV to 1.48 eV,8,9 and FAxMA1−xPbI3 presents longer PL lifetimes and higher PCE.9 Although the FAxMA1−xPbI3 solar cell devices have been investigated, the basic exciton binding energy and band gap property of FAxMA1−xPbI3 are not reported, which are very important for the FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite optoelectronic devices. In addition, both FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 undergo phase transition at around 120 K, and the phase transition of FAxMA1−xPbI3 is still unknown. So it is of significance to reveal the temperature-dependent PL properties.
In this paper, we synthesized a series of FAxMA1−xPbI3 (x = 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2) perovskite nanostructures through a simple solution method. The temperature-dependent PL of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 nanostructures was investigated by gradually increasing the temperature from 10 K to room temperature; unique band gap changes and phase transition were observed from these samples. By fitting the integrated temperature-dependent PL intensity, the exciton binding energies of FAxMA1−xPbI3 nanostructures were obtained. These results reveal the basic optical properties of mixed-cation FAxMA1−xPbI3 nanostructures, and can help the researchers to design and modulate perovskite optoelectronic devices.
Experimental
The FAxMA1−xPbI3 nanostructures were synthesized by a simple solution method.9,10 Firstly, 100 mg of lead acetate trihydrate (Pb(Ac)2·3H2O) was dissolved in 1 mL of methanol to obtain the lead precursor solution. Then 100 μL of precursor solution was dropped on a glass substrate of size 1 cm2, following which the precursor solution disperses on the substrate very quickly. Then the substrate was heated at 50 °C for 10 minutes to evaporate methanol to form a Pb(Ac)2·3H2O thin film layer. Secondly, mixed MAI/FAI isopropanol solutions (15 mg mL−1) with different FA/MA ratios were prepared. Then the Pb(Ac)2·3H2O substrates were put in vials, and the MAI/FAI isopropanol solutions were added into the vials. The reaction was performed at 50 °C for 2 hours. Finally the substrates were taken out and washed in pure isopropanol solution to remove the reaction solution, then the samples were dried under nitrogen gas to remove isopropanol.
The SEM images of these samples were measured using a Zeiss scanning electron microscope. Powder XRD spectra were examined using a Bruker D8 Advance Powder X-ray Diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The sample was placed in a quartz cell and the temperature was tuned from 10 K to room temperature using a cryogenic system (Janis 150c). The sample was excited by a He-Cd CW laser (325 nm, 40 mW), and the temperature-dependent PL spectra were collected using a spectrometer (SP 2500i, Acton). The absorption spectra were investigated using an absorption spectrometer (UV-2600, Shimadzu).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the image of the FA0.8MA0.2PbI3, FA0.6MA0.4PbI3, FA0.4MA0.6PbI3, FA0.2MA0.8PbI3 samples. All of the mixed-cation FAxMA1−xPbI3 samples are black which indicates that they are mainly of black perovskite phase. Fig. 1b–e show their SEM images. The FA0.8MA0.2PbI3 sample mainly shows rod structures with a diameter of about 200 nm and a length of 5 μm; the FA0.6MA0.4PbI3, FA0.4MA0.6PbI3, and FA0.2MA0.8PbI3 samples present a cubic plate structure with a thickness of about 700 nm and a size of 2 μm.

XRD patterns of samples are shown in Fig. 2a. Pure α-FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 are trigonal phase and tetragonal phase, respectively.11–14 Among the as-synthesized samples, FA0.2MA0.8PbI3, FA0.4MA0.6PbI3, and FA0.6MA0.4PbI3 samples present a clear cubic perovskite phase, and FA0.8MA0.2PbI3 shows both hexagonal and cubic perovskite phases. The formation of stable cubic FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite phase is attributed to the MA+ with a small radius, which causes a lower Goldsmith tolerance factor for cubic perovskite phase.9,10 In Fig. 2a each diffraction peak of cubic perovskite phase shows a slight blue-shift when FA content is increased, which is caused by the increase of lattice spacing because of the doping of the FA+ with a large radius. Fig. 2b shows the dependence of (100) lattice spacing on FA content, which agrees well with Vegard's law. Although the FA0.8MA0.2PbI3 sample contains hexagonal phase crystal domains, the hexagonal phase FAPbI3 is nonluminescent, so the hexagonal FAPbI3 structure domains in the FA0.8MA0.2PbI3 nanostructure will not affect the PL properties.

Fig. 3 shows the temperature-dependent PL spectra of FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite nanostructures from 10 K to room temperature. All of the samples show that the PL intensity decreases very quickly when the temperature is increased from 10 K to room temperature. The temperature-dependent center PL emission wavelength (λcenter) is plotted in Fig. 4a. From the temperature-dependent PL spectra, we can find whether there is phase transition according to the shift of λcenter for the FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite nanostructures. The exciton binding energy can be fitted via the PL intensity change. For pure α-FAPbI3 and MAPbI3, when the temperature is increased from 10 K to room temperature, λcenter shows a continuous blueshift except for an interrupted redshift due to the orthorhombic–tetragonal phase transition at the temperature point of about 120 K.14,15

 Fig. 4  (a) The temperature-dependent λcenter of FAxMA1−xPbI3 nanostructures. (b) The temperature-dependent bandgap of FAxMA1−xPbI3. 
From Fig. 3 and 4a, we can find that the λcenter for FAxMA1−xPbI3 (x = 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2) samples are 844 nm, 818 nm, 794 nm and 767 nm at 10 K, respectively; FAxMA1−xPbI3 with high FA content shows longer center PL wavelength because the FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite with higher FA content has a narrower band gap. Firstly, all of the λcenter for FAxMA1−xPbI3 (x = 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2) show blueshift when the temperature is increased from 10 K to 90 K; then λcenter starts to present redshift when the temperature is increased from 90 K to about 200 K, which is due to the phase transition region from orthorhombic phase to tetragonal phase.15,16 For FAxMA1−xPbI3 (x = 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2) samples, their crystal structure totally changes to tetragonal phase when the temperature is above 180 K, 200 K, 225 K, 225 K, respectively. Different from the pure α-FAPbI3 and MAPbI3, the FAxMA1−xPbI3 samples exhibit much longer transitional orthorhombic–tetragonal temperature region, the reason being probably that the mixed-cation of FAxMA1−xPbI3 can slowdown the phase transition process, so their phase transition temperature region is much wider than that of the pure α-FAPbI3 and MAPbI3. It is worth noticing that the XRD result in Fig. 2 shows that the FAxMA1−xPbI3 samples present cubic phase at room temperature, which indicates that there is tetragonal–cubic phase transition between 200 K and room temperature, and the tetragonal–cubic phase transition usually does not present the reversal shift of the λcenter (band gap shift), which agrees with the previous report.17 When the temperature is increased up to 300 K, the λcenter for FAxMA1−xPbI3 (x = 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2) samples are located at 811 nm, 803 nm, 797 nm and 788 nm, respectively. In addition, we can find that the PL broadening can be easily observed in the high temperature region in Fig. 3, which is attributed to exciton–phonon interactions at higher temperature.18
Different from the other three samples, temperature-dependent PL of FA0.2MA0.8PbI3 always presents double-peak PL emission when the temperature is below 125 K. The two emission peaks are located at 765 nm and 800 nm at 10 K, as shown in Fig. 3d. The emission peak at 800 nm disappears when the temperature is increased to 125 K. We suggest that the emission peak at 765 nm at 10 K is originated from the free exciton, and the emission peak at 800 nm should come from the bound exciton because of its lower energy than the free exciton.
It is well known that FAPbI3 has a narrower band gap than that of MAPbI3, so the increase of FA content in FAxMA1−xPbI3 will decrease the band gap.8,9 Consistent with the temperature-dependent λcenter change in Fig. 4a, the band gap changes with temperature, as shown in Fig. 4b. The bandgap Eg values of FAxMA1−xPbI3 (x = 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2) are 1.47 eV, 1.52 eV, 1.56 eV, and 1.62 eV at 10 K, respectively. When the temperature is increased to room temperature, the Eg of FAxMA1−xPbI3 (x = 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2) increase up to 1.53 eV, 1.54 eV, 1.56 eV, and 1.57 eV, respectively. With the increase of temperature, the band gap increases in the orthorhombic and tetragonal phase, and decreases in the transitional orthorhombic–tetragonal temperature region. We can also find that FAxMA1−xPbI3 with higher FA content always has a narrower band gap at any given temperature even around the phase transition temperature, which means that the band gap modulation by doping FA+ is very stable for any temperature. Another remarkable result in Fig. 4b shows that the band gap difference ΔEg between FA0.2MA0.8PbI3 and FA0.8MA0.2PbI3 is ∼0.15 eV at 10 K and it significantly decreases to ∼0.04 eV at room temperature. The previous experiments have revealed that MAPbI3 and FAPbI3 have a smaller band gap at room temperature than that at 10 K,14,15,19 and their band gap difference decreases with the increase of temperature, so the band gap difference for FAxMA1−xPbI3 in Fig. 4b is reasonable.
Exciton is the electron–hole pair bounded by Coulomb attraction, and exciton binding energy denotes the interaction strength between the exciton and the luminescent center. For organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites, the hybrid organic–inorganic cation makes the exciton in the lead halide perovskites intermediate between the tightly bound organic Frenkel exciton and the loosely bound inorganic Wannier one.20 The reported exciton binding energies for MAPbI3 range from 2 to 55 meV.19,21–26 The mixed-cation FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite materials show potential application in solar cell devices; however, their exciton binding energy is still unknown. Fig. 5 shows the relationship between the integrated PL intensity and temperature. The FAxMA1−xPbI3 in the transitional orthorhombic–tetragonal temperature region undergoes a change of the periodic crystal potential field, which affects the exciton properties, thermal stability and PL stability of tetragonal FAxMA1−xPbI3 in the temperature region [200 K, 300 K], so we plotted the data for the samples at orthorhombic phase for fitting the exciton binding energy. As shown in Fig. 5, the integrated PL intensity presents a perfect exponential decay process with temperature, which can be well fitted by the Arrhenius equation,18 (1)where I(T) and I0 are the integrated PL intensities at temperature T and 0 K, respectively. A is a constant, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and EB is the exciton binding energy. The fitted exciton binding energies are 20.8 ± 3.9 meV, 6.7 ± 3.3 meV, 8.7 ± 1.6 meV and 28.7 ± 6.9 meV for FA0.8MA0.2PbI3, FA0.6MA0.4PbI3, FA0.4MA0.6PbI3, and FA0.2MA0.8PbI3 nanostructures, respectively. We can find that the exciton binding energy becomes smaller when the FA/MA ratio is closer to 1:1. This indicates that it is easy to form free exciton carriers instead of bound exciton carriers if FA/MA is close to 1:1. The references reported that FAxMA1−xPbI3 solar cells can present better PCEs when FA/MA is close to 1:1,8 which shows that there are more free-carriers than bound-carriers, which demonstrates that the fitted exciton binding energy is reasonable. On the other hand, Frenkel excitons often exhibit an exciton binding energy on the level of ∼0.1–1 eV, and the Wannier type exciton has an exciton binding energy of the order of ∼10 meV, so the result indicates that the excitons in FAxMA1−xPbI3 are all Wannier type.27

MAPbI3 has a small Urbach tail of 15 meV with a sharp shoulder in its absorption spectra,28,29 which suggests that MAPbI3 has a low degree of structural disorder, high crystalline quality and excellent photovoltaic performance. The reported mixed cation FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite solar cell devices show perfect power conversion efficiency,8,28 so we speculate that FAxMA1−xPbI3 also present a low Urbach tail. Fig. 6 shows the absorption spectra of FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite nanostructures. We can clearly find that when the FA content increases, the band edge gradually shifts to the low energy side, which agrees well with the band gap modulation of the ternary semiconductor alloys. In addition, we also find that the absorption band edge for each FAxMA1−xPbI3 sample presents a very sharp shoulder with a width of about 80 meV; the estimated Urbach tail is about 25 meV, which is very close to the reported result.29,30 So FAxMA1−xPbI3 has potential application in solar cell devices.

Conclusion
In summary, we synthesized FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite nanostructures by a simple solution method. The temperature-dependent PL of FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite nanostructures was investigated. The FAxMA1−xPbI3 samples present orthorhombic–tetragonal phase transition, and the phase transition temperature range is much wider than that of the pure α-FAPbI3 and MAPbI3 because the mixed-cation FA+ and MA+ probably slowdown the phase transition process. In addition, the band gap increases with temperature except for the transitional orthorhombic–tetragonal temperature region, and the band gap difference decreases with the increase of temperature. The exciton binding energies of the FAxMA1−xPbI3 nanostructures are fitted, and they are all smaller than 30 meV, which indicates that the excitons in the FAxMA1−xPbI3 nanostructures are Wannier type excitons. Finally, the absorption spectra of FAxMA1−xPbI3 nanostructures present low Urbach energies, which indicates the advantage of them in solar cells. These results are helpful for further design and improvement of FAxMA1−xPbI3 perovskite devices.
