    , Accepted 12th July 2016First published on 13th July 2016AbstractFour D–A copolymers, PNTDBT, PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT, were prepared for systematically studying the effect of fluorination on photovoltaic performance. The fluorinated copolymers, PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT, gave higher FF (∼70%) than PNTDBT due to their reduced bimolecular recombination and balanced mobilities. PNTDFBT with F on the BT unit shows a higher mobility than that of PFNTDBT with F on the NTD unit, leading to a higher Jsc. PFNTDFBT gave the highest PCE, 7.79%, which might result from its higher mobility and the optimal miscibility between PFNTDFBT and PC71BM.
High-performance D–A copolymers as donor materials are very important for polymer solar cells (PSCs) to obtain high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).1 To obtain a high efficiency, some approaches, such as designing new building blocks,2 side chain engineering3 and substituent optimization,4 have been tried. Among them, grafting fluorine onto the backbone of D–A copolymers is an effective method to enhance PCEs.5 First, fluorine is the smallest electron-withdrawing group with a van der Waals radius of 1.35 Å, and introducing fluorine onto the polymer backbone does not induce steric hindrance and harm molecular planarity. Second, fluorine is the most electronegative element with an electronegativity of 4.0 and it can push down HOMO and LUMO simultaneously without decreasing the bandgap of D–A copolymers, which benefits the open-circuit voltage (Voc).6 Third, fluorine can lock-up neighboring units via C–F⋯S, C–F⋯H and C–F⋯π interactions.7 Many fluorinated polymers have been developed,8 giving higher PCEs compared with non-fluorinated analogues. The fluorinated polymer, PffBT4T-C9C13, gave a PCE of 11.7%, which is the record for single-junction PSCs.9 Many research studies have been carried out to study the effects of fluorination on photovoltaic performance. Fluorine can facilitate charge separation,10 affect packing orientation on the substrate,11 enhance charge carrier mobility,12 adjust backbone orientation at the D/A interface,13 and reduce charge recombination.14 Some work focused on the effect of fluorine number on the photovoltaic performance of polymers.15 In this work, we synthesized four D–A copolymers, PNTDBT, PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT, to study the effect of the fluorination position on optical properties, energy levels and photovoltaic performance. PFNTDFBT shows a higher mobility, giving the highest PCE of 7.79%.
The synthetic routes for the monomers and copolymers are shown in Scheme 1. 2,5-Dibromothiophene-3,4-dicarboxylic acid (1)16 reacted with benzene and 1,4-difluorobenzene, respectively, producing 2a and 2b (Friedel–Crafts reaction). Pd-catalyzed Stille coupling of 2a and 2b with tributyl(4-(2-hexyldecyl)thiophen-2-yl)stannane gave compounds NTD and FNTD, respectively. Brominating NTD and FNTD with NBS in CHCl3/DMF gave the monomers, NTD-Br and FNTD-Br, respectively. Four copolymers, PNTDBT, PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT, were synthesized via copolymerizing the monomers in refluxing toluene with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. The crude products were purified via Soxhlet extraction using methanol, hexane, and chloroform in sequence. The chloroform fractions were concentrated and then precipitated in methanol to afford purified polymers. All polymers exhibit good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, and o-dichlorobenzene. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) for PNTDBT, PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT are 22.1, 15.3, 36.1 and 39.0 kDa with the PDI of 1.42, 2.16, 2.19 and 1.98, respectively. The thermal properties of the polymers were evaluated by TGA and DSC under nitrogen (Fig. S9 and S10†). The decomposition temperatures (Td, 5% wt loss) for PNTDBT, PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT are 409, 396, 408 and 398 °C, respectively, indicating that all polymers possess good thermal stability and the fluorination has negligible effects on the thermal stability. All the polymers exhibit distinct crystallization and melting peaks, and the endothermic peaks for PNTDBT, PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT are located at 163, 193, 242 and 218 °C, respectively. The results suggest that these polymers are semicrystalline.

UV/Vis absorption spectra were used to study the optical properties of the polymers and the data are listed in Table 1. In solution, PNTDBT, PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT show absorption peaks at 562, 547, 578 and 613 nm, respectively (Fig. S11†). When comparing PNTDFBT with PNTDBT and PFNTDFBT with PFNTDBT, we observed red shifts in absorption. This might result from the enhancement in backbone planarity since fluorine can lock up the neighboring thiophene rings. This lock-up function of the F atom on the BT unit is based on C–F⋯S interaction. From solution to the solid state, the absorption spectra for PNTDBT and PFNTDBT show remarkable red shifts with maximum peaks at 587 and 580 nm, respectively. The red shifts result from π–π stacking in the solid state (Fig. 1). The absorption spectra for PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT films show slight changes. The absorption onsets for PNTDBT, PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT films are 721, 724, 731 and 736 nm, respectively. The optical bandgaps for PNTDBT, PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT films are 1.72, 1.71, 1.70 and 1.68 eV, respectively, suggesting that fluorination reduces the optical bandgaps slightly. PFNTDFBT possesses higher absorption coefficients at long wavelength than other polymers, which benefits Jsc. The electrochemical properties of the polymers were studied by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S13†). The oxidation onset potentials (Eonox) for PNTDBT, PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT are 0.41 V, 0.43 V, 0.52 V and 0.52 V, respectively. The reduction onset potentials (Eonred) for PNTDBT, PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT are −1.85 V, −1.38 V, −1.41 V and −1.33 V, respectively. The HOMO energy levels for PNTDBT, PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT are −5.21 eV, −5.23 eV, −5.32 eV and −5.32 eV, respectively, while the LUMO energy levels are −2.95 eV, −3.42 eV, −3.39 eV and −3.47 eV, respectively (Table 1). The HOMO energy levels for PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT are ∼0.1 eV deeper than that of PNTDBT and PFNTDBT, suggesting that the F atom on the BT unit can push down the HOMO, leading to higher Voc.

Inverted solar cells with a structure of ITO/ZnO/polymer:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag were prepared to study the effect of fluorination on the photovoltaic properties of the polymers. The J–V curves and the performance data for the best cells are presented in Fig. 2 and Table 2, respectively. The optimization results for the devices are summarized in Tables S2–S13.† The Voc for PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT cells (0.89 and 0.90 V) are higher than that of PNTDBT and PFNTDBT cells due to their deeper HOMO levels. The Jsc for PNTDBT, PFNTDBT and PNTDFBT cells are 5.55, 5.51 and 9.96 mA cm−2, respectively, suggesting that F on the BT unit can improve photocurrent significantly. Compared with PNTDBT cells, PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT cells gave much higher FF (69–70%), indicating that fluorination can increase FF. This could result from the enhancement of charge transport and better phase separation. Compared with PNTDBT cells (PCE 2.80%), PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT cells gave PCEs of 6.24% and 7.79%, respectively, suggesting that fluorination on the BT unit enhances the PCE greatly. PFNTDFBT cells afford higher EQE with a maximum of 62.4% at 577 nm (Fig. 2b). The Jsc values obtained from EQE spectra are 5.56, 5.71, 9.63 and 11.84 mA cm−2 for PNTDBT, PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT cells, respectively, which are similar to those values obtained from J–V measurements. The light-harvesting capability, phase separation and charge carrier mobility could lead to the difference in the photovoltaic performance of these materials. To investigate bimolecular recombination in the active layers, Jsc was treated as a function of incident light intensity, Plight, and the data were fitted to a power law: Jsc ∝ Pαlight (Fig. 3).17 The exponent α for PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT cells is 0.991, 0.992 and 0.991, respectively, which is close to 1, suggesting less bimolecular recombination in the active layers, thus leading to decent FF.18 The morphology of the blend films was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 4) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S14†). Compared with the PFNTDFBT:PC71BM blend film (Fig. 4), the PFNTDBT:PC71BM blend film and the PNTDFBT:PC71BM blend film present relatively large domains, causing fewer D/A interfaces and lower Jsc. The optimal miscibility between PFNTDFBT and PC71BM led to more D/A interfaces for exciton dissociation, thus producing a much higher Jsc of 12.57 mA cm−2. The RMS roughness for PNTDBT:PC71BM, PFNTDBT:PC71BM, PNTDFBT:PC71BM and PFNTDFBT:PC71BM blend films is 6.31, 5.76, 4.81 and 2.86 nm, respectively (Fig. S14†). The surface properties of the films might be affected by the miscibility and wettability of the coating materials.

The space charge limited current (SCLC) method was used to evaluate the hole and electron mobilities of the blend films (Fig. S15†). The hole mobilities for PNTDBT, PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT blend films are 6.58 × 10−5, 7.66 × 10−5, 1.14 × 10−4 and 2.05 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Obviously, F on the BT unit can enhance the hole mobility, thus leading to higher Jsc (see Table 2). The electron mobilities for PNTDBT, PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT blend films are 3.42 × 10−5, 5.49 × 10−5, 8.21 × 10−5 and 1.47 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. μe/μh for PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT blend films is ∼0.72, which is closer to 1 than that for the PNTDBT blend film. Balanced charge carrier mobilities favor the reduction of charge recombination, leading to a higher FF of ∼70%.19 X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of PNTDBT, PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT films show diffraction peaks at 23.9°, 24.1°, 24.5° and 24.1°, corresponding to π–π stacking d-spacings of 3.72, 3.69, 3.63 and 3.69 Å, respectively (Fig. S16†). PFNTDFBT presents a stronger peak at 24.1°, suggesting that the π–π stacking in the PFNTDFBT film is better than that in other three polymer films. After fluorination, the π–π stacking d-spacing reduced, indicating improved π–π stacking.
Conclusions
Four conjugated copolymers, PNTDBT, PFNTDBT, PNTDFBT and PFNTDFBT, were synthesized to study the effect of fluorination on the properties of the polymers. Fluorination reduces the optical bandgap of the polymers slightly. The F atom on the BT unit can improve backbone planarity via its lock-up function, and thus facilitate π–π stacking and enhance hole mobility. The F atom on the BT unit can increase Voc, Jsc and FF simultaneously. Among them, PFNTDFBT shows a high mobility and its solar cells gave a PCE of 7.79%. Further work to use fluorination to develop highly efficient polymers for solar cells is ongoing.
