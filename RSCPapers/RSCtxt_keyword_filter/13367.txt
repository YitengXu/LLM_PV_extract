    , Accepted 12th December 2016First published on 12th December 2016AbstractMolybdenum oxide (MoOx) films show great potential for use in electrical devices because they display a diversity of valence states of the Mo cation. A simple and mild sol–gel route was developed to synthesize MoOx hole transport layers (HTLs) for organic solar cells to replace the traditional evaporation process for MoOx films, which is difficult to achieve with low-cost mass production. The oxygen vacancies and valency of the Mo in the MoOx HTLs can be well controlled by introducing and adjusting the amount of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the precursors. This method gives MoOx HTLs with a high conductivity, transparency and well-aligned band structure, with the highest occupied molecular orbital in the active layer. The molar ratio of Mo to citric acid in the precursor solution and the annealing temperature of the process have important roles and were optimized as Mo:citric = 0.025:0.075 mol L−1 and 200 °C, respectively, for the fabrication of the most efficient solar cells. The performance of the organic solar cells containing the solution-processed MoOx HTLs was comparable with that of reference devices using evaporated MoOx HTLs or poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiohene):poly(styrenesulfonate) HTLs. HTLs obtained via this route show promise for universal application in a variety of solar cells and provide valuable insights for the production of fast, large-scale, low-cost and renewable sources of energy.
I. Introduction
Molybdenum oxides (MoOx) are attracting increasing attention from materials scientists and device researchers1–4 because they can be tuned as p- or n-type semiconductors by manipulating the synthesis and fabrication of MoOx.5–7 MoOx displays various phases (e.g. the alpha-, beta- and h-phases of MoO3), a wide range of oxygen stoichiometry (e.g. Mo18O52, Mo9O26, Mo8O23, Mo5O14, Mo17O47, Mo4O11 and MoO2) and a number of different valence states of the Mo cation (e.g. 4+, 5+, 6+). The physical properties can be reversed from those of an insulator to a semiconductor by changing the band structure, the density of states and the band gap.8,9 The Fermi level of MoOx can be altered by doping with different elements, such as Sr,10 Al11 (n-type) and In (p-type),12 which can modify the carrier density and conduction type for use in various electronic applications. MoOx can be used as a buffer layer, e.g. an electron transport layer or a hole transport layer (HTL) in organic electronic devices, which have been steadily evolving over the past few years and have begun to penetrate the mainstream consumer electronics market.13–17 MoOx can be used in photovoltaic solar cells as a result of the adjustable properties of the work function, the suitable band gap (3.0–3.8 eV), high transparency (>80%) in the visible and near-IR range and well-aligned energy levels with an active organic layer in organic solar cells (OSCs).18–22
Homogenous and smooth MoOx HTLs have been fabricated via an evaporation process (eMoOx) and demonstrated a high hole transport ability when used in OSCs.23–25 However, the evaporation process is time consuming and sensitive to contamination,26 which increases the manufacturing costs of the OSCs and is incompatible with the large area processing of flexible OSCs. In addition, there is a severe loss of oxygen from the oxide during the evaporation process, which may change its energy levels, lower the work function and make it less suitable for extracting holes from the active layer.27
The use of solution-processed MoOx (sMoOx) interfacial HTLs in solution-processed OSCs results in a simplified process for device fabrication. Several fabrication routes have been reported for sMoOx HTLs that take advantage of the ability to precisely control the composition, high homogeneity, large area, flexibility and low processing cost of these HTLs.28–31 However, sMoOx HTLs still face several challenges in the fabrication of efficient OSCs. One of the difficulties is the control of the stoichiometry of O and Mo within the intrinsic oxide using a simple annealing process, which is required to optimize the annealing temperature used in the fabrication of MoOx HTLs with abundant polyvalencies and a high work function.32–35
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a strong oxidizer and can be used to control the oxidation state of the oxides through a simple solution process. Choy and coworkers10,36 developed a solution process to make efficient MoOx HTLs using H2O2 to dissolve metallic Mo in water and demonstrated effective control of the stoichiometry of Mo and O in MoOx HTLs. However, excessive O vacancies may be introduced during the dissolution process, which will lower the work function. The process of Choy and coworkers10,36 is a violently exothermic oxidation reaction, which requires a further step to lower the reaction temperature. We recently developed a much milder H2O2-based process for the sMoOx HTLs.37 Smoother and more conductive sMoOx HTLs were fabricated and a better performance of OSCs was achieved, suggesting that it was possible to fabricate solution-processed MoOx HTLs via a simple annealing process. However, the reaction mechanism involving H2O2 during the fabrication of HTLs is still unclear.
We report here a mild route for the fabrication of sMoOx HTLs using H2O2 based on a modified method from our previous work.38–40 The MoOx HTLs and referential eMoOx or PEDOT:PSS HTLs were used to fabricate the OSCs. sMoOx has recently been shown by our group to be a promising interfacial material for CZTSe-based solar cells,41 but required corrosive, high-temperature preparation conditions. This paper focuses on the material properties of sMoOx HTLs. We analyzed the function of H2O2 in the precursor materials and examined the hole transport abilities of the OSCs. A detailed study of the sMoOx was carried out to determine the evolution of their structural, chemical and electronic properties. The knowledge gathered from this study may contribute to the research and development of universal applications for organic electronic devices using solution-processed MoOx buffer layers (or HTLs).
II. Results and discussion
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the sMoOx HTLs, conventional OSCs with a layered structure were fabricated (Fig. 1). The interfacial sMoOx HTL was sandwiched between the active organic material (PV10:PC70BM) and the ITO electrode. A ZnO thin film was fabricated for use as the electron transport layer on the top of active layer and below the Al electrode. Apart from the electrodes, all the layers were fabricated using a solution process.
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of an organic solar cell with a conventional layered structure. The hole transport layer was fabricated under the active organic material PV10:PC70BM and on top of the ITO substrate. 
Compared with traditional eMoOx, two different types of sMoOx HTL were developed: sMoOx_A and sMoOx_B. sMoOx_A is an sMoOx film fabricated without H2O2 treatment, whereas sMoOx_B was fabricated with H2O2 treatment. The electronic, optical and morphological properties of the two thin films were examined.
The effects of H2O2 treatment on the electronic structure of the two types of sMoOx film were characterized by high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 2 shows the chemical characteristics and stoichiometry of the eMoOx, sMoOx_A and sMoOx_B films. Survey scans were conducted from 0 to 600 eV with calibration using the standard peak value of carbon at 284.6 eV. The Mo 3d peaks for the three films were located at the same position. The fine peaks of Mo 3d were fitted by Gaussian–Lorentzian curves with a ratio of 3d5/2 to 3d3/2 of 3:2 and the spin orbital splitting of the Mo 3d doublets was fixed at 3.13 eV.42–44 After fitting, the MoOx thin films mainly featured two 3d doublet Gaussian peaks centered at 232.7 and 235.8 eV. These values were close to those of the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 Mo6+ oxidation states (232.8 and 235.9 eV, respectively).35 Two more doublets at 231.6 and 234.7 eV were identified under the main Mo6+ peaks, which were attributed to the Mo5+ peaks. The sMoOx_A film showed almost the same weak Mo5+ peaks as eMoOx. The sMoOx_B film showed broad peaks, which contained much more intense Mo5+ peaks than sMoOx_A. The higher polyvalence of the sMoOx_B film compared with the sMoOx_A film indicated that it contained more oxygen vacancies—that is, H2O2 promoted the formation of oxygen vacancies. Li et al.35 have reported that oxygen vacancies modified the Fermi level and enhanced the carrier transfer abilities of oxides. Therefore the sMoOx_B film, which had more vacancies than the sMoOx_A film, may have a lower series resistance and better performance in OSCs.

To investigate the optical properties of the MoOx-based films, the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption and transmission spectra of the eMoOx, sMoOx_A and sMoOx_B films on ITO substrates were measured (Fig. 3). All three types of film showed a high transparency of >80% in the wavelength range 600–900 nm. In the shorter wavelength range of visible light of 300–600 nm, the transparency of sMoOx_B was about 80%, which was a little higher than that of the eMoOx layer. By contrast, the transparency of sMoOx_A was about 70% in this range, suggesting undesirable optical properties. When the substrate signals were removed, the three types of film showed transparencies >90% (Fig. S1, ESI†). The different transparencies of these three types of films will affect their performance as HTLs in OSCs. Using the cutoff wavelength λ (Fig. 3), the band gaps (Eg) of all three types of films were calculated as 3.8 eV according to the equation Eg = 1.24/λ.45

The morphological properties of sMoOx_A and sMoOx_B were only slightly different (Fig. S2a and b, ESI†). Both sMoOx_A and sMoOx_B homogenously covered the surface of the substrates and had a thickness of about 10 nm. To further observe the surface morphology of the thin films, tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of sMoOx_A and sMoOx_B on silicon substrates were obtained (Fig. S2c and d, ESI† respectively). The sMoOx-based films showed amorphous properties. The sMoOx_A and sMoOx_B films had a similar surface morphology with root mean square roughness values of 0.27 and 0.24 nm, respectively, and average roughness values of 0.21 and 0.18 nm, respectively. The smooth surfaces of both films may enhance contact with the active layer, lengthen the lifetime of the photocarriers and improve the performance of OSCs.46,47
OSCs with a PV10:PC70BM polymer/fullerene-based active layer and a conventional device structure were used to investigate the function of the sMoOx-based HTLs. The cross-sectional SEM images of OSC with a structure of ITO/MoOx/PV10:PC70BM/ZnO from bottom to top are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The boundary of each layer can be clearly observed, especially for the interfacial ZnO ETLs (∼20 nm thick) and the sMoOx HTLs (∼10 nm thick), indicating there is no interpenetration between the solution-processed layers. For comparison, reference devices with PEDOT:PSS or eMoOx as the interfacial layer were also fabricated. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of these devices under illumination and in the dark are presented in Fig. 4a and the inset of Fig. 4a, respectively. The parameters measured for the devices are summarized in Table 1. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the sMoOx_A- and sMoOx_B-based OSCs are shown in Fig. 4b.

The sMoOx_B-based device exhibited the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.19%, a fill factor (FF) of 72.55%, the highest short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 13.57 mA cm−2 and a moderate open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.73 V. The sMoOx_A-based device displayed a moderate FF of 69.81% and the lowest PCE of 6.41% as a result of its lowest Voc of 0.71 V. The PEDOT:PSS-based device showed a lower PCE (7.05%) than the sMoOx_B-based device, even though it had the highest Voc of 0.82 V, because of its lowest FF of 68.26% and Jsc of 12.61 mA cm−2. Like the PEDOT:PSS-based device, the eMoOx-based device achieved a moderate PCE of 6.48% because its FF and Jsc were low (70.93% and 12.51 mA cm−2, respectively), although it showed the same Voc as the sMoOx_B-based device (0.73 V). Compared with the PEDOT:PSS-based device, the lower Voc of the MoOx-based device indicates that all the MoOx (including sMoOx and eMoOx) films exhibited a slightly lower work function than PEDOT:PSS as a result of the loss of oxygen.
These device characteristics were also reflected in the current curves of the devices obtained in the dark (Fig. 4a, inset). The PEDOT:PSS-based device showed poor diode properties with the highest leakage current density in both the reverse and forward bias, which coincided with its low Jsc and FF. Although the sMoOx_B- and sMoOx_A-based devices showed almost the same low leakage current, the current density of the sMoOx_B-based device (H2O2-modified) in the forward bias mode was a little higher than that of the sMoOx_A-based device (without H2O2), indicating that the sMoOx_B-based device had the lowest series resistance and thus improved performance compared with the sMoOx_A-based device. The reverse-bias current of the eMoOx-based device was higher than that of the sMoOx_B-based device, but lower than that of the PEDOT:PSS-based device. The EQE of the sMoOx_B-based device was also much higher than that of the sMoOx_A-based device.
The J–V curves of the sMoOx_A-, sMoOx_B- and eMoOx-based devices indicate that the Voc of the three types of device were almost the same; however, their Jsc values followed the order sMoOx_B > sMoOx_A > eMoOx. Considering the UV-vis, XPS, AFM, J–V and EQE results, the sMoOx_B-based device exhibited the highest performance, which coincided with its high transparency throughout the visible region, high polyvalence and smooth surface.
To optimize the hole transport abilities of the sMoOx_B HTLs for OSCs, the molar ratio of the Mo and citric acid in the precursors was changed to 0.05:0.15 and 0.1:0.3 and the influence of the HTL thickness on device performance was studied. The HTLs synthesized from these precursor solutions by spin-coating on ITO substrates and subsequent annealing at 200 °C for 10 min were defined as sMoOx_2B and sMoOx_4B, respectively. The J–V curves of these OSCs are shown in Fig. 5a. The Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE values of these solar cells are listed in Table 1. Fig. 5a shows that the devices fabricated with various molar ratios exhibited different performances. The cells without an HTL showed a poor performance with the lowest values of Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE of 0.14 V, 11.73 mA cm−2, 41.08% and 0.67%, respectively, which indicates a mismatch of energy levels at the interface between the electrode and the active layer and therefore the poor extraction of holes. In contrast with the device without HTLs, the devices based on sMoOx_B, sMoOx_2B and sMoOx_4B HTLs showed an improved performance. These three types of device had almost the same Voc of about 0.7 eV. Jsc decreased with increasing molar ratios of Mo in the precursors, which may result from the non-optimum layer thickness due to the increase in the series resistance of these HTLs.33 The sMoOx_B-based device exhibited the highest FF and PCE of 72.5 and 7.19%, respectively.

To further investigate the influence of H2O2 on the performance of OSCs with sMoOx-based HTLs, the volume percentage of H2O2 in the precursor solution was adjusted to 10 and 20 vol% to fabricate the HTLs, which were defined as sMoOx_B and sMoOx_B_2H, respectively. The J–V characteristics of OSCs based on these HTLs are shown in Fig. 5b. The sMoOx_B_2H-based device had lower Jsc and Voc values of 0.69 mA cm−2 and 12.12 V, respectively, and a correspondingly low FF of 65.67% and PCE of 5.49%. The poor performance of the sMoOx_B_2H-based device indicated that 20 vol% H2O2 was too high a concentration in the precursor solution. The reason for the lower Voc of the sMoOx_B_2H-based device may result from the lower work function of the thin film. XPS analysis of sMoO_B (with 10 vol% H2O2 in the precursor) showed that the Mo peaks broadened compared with sMoOx_A (without H2O2 in the precusor) as a result of the existence of intense Mo5+ peaks, even though the main peaks were indexed to Mo6+. When excess H2O2 was added to the precursor solution, the resulting much higher content of Mo5+ caused a shift in the main Mo 3d peaks to a lower energy, which decreased the work function of the sMoOx_B_2H.
The annealing temperature of the sMoOx_B-based HTLs was also investigated to optimize the performance of the corresponding OSCs. The sMoOx_B films were annealed at temperatures of 100, 200 and 300 °C and were used as HTLs in OSCs. The mean FF and PCE with a standard deviation of 12 cells at each temperature are shown in Fig. 5c. The HTLs annealed at 200 °C showed the optimum FF and PCE. The poorer performance of the devices annealed at 100 and 300 °C may result from the remaining organic components in the case of a lower annealing temperature of 100 °C, or the higher surface roughness and discontinuity of the HTLs annealed at the higher temperature of 300 °C, respectively (Fig. S4, ESI†).
III. Conclusions
Solution-processed MoOx-based HTLs for OSCs were fabricated by dissolving (NH4)2MoO4 and citric acid in H2O2-modified 2-methoxyethanol. The resulting HTLs showed a smoother surface (root mean square roughness of 0.24 nm), higher transparency (>90%) and lower resistivity (3.9 Ω cm−2) than those fabricated without H2O2. The performance of OSCs containing the HTLs produced from the H2O2-modified precursor was higher than that of the devices produced without H2O2 and comparable with cells with PEDOT:PSS or eMoOx HTLs. The enhancement in device performance was attributed to the increased polyvalence of Mo in the oxide thin films attained by introducing 10 vol% H2O2 into the precursors. The influence of the molar ratio of the Mo source and annealing temperature on the performance of OSCs based on the solution-processed HTLs were also investigated; the optimized values were 0.075 mol L−1 and 200 °C. These results show that MoOx HTLs fabricated by this route are promising replacements for conventional eMoOx HTLs and may contribute to the mass production of OSCs by virtue of their simple and low-cost fabrication process.
IV. Experimental
Precursor solutions were prepared with and without H2O2. The precursors without H2O2 were prepared using a procedure modified from our previous work.38,39 Ammonium molybdate (97.0%, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and citric acid (anhydrous, 98.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol (5 mL, Sigma-Aldrich) at a ratio of 0.025:0.075 mol L−1 with magnetic stirring for 4 h; the solution was then aged in air for 24 h to give solution A. Solution B was prepared in the same way as solution A, but H2O2 (30 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the 2-methoxyethanol to give a total volume of 5 mL with a volume ratio of H2O2 to 2-methoxyethanol of 10:90. After H2O2 was added into the solution, the color instantly changed from faint to bright yellow (Fig. S2c and d, inset, ESI† respectively). This suggested that the valence of the Mo ions in the solution had changed from 5+ to 6+ and that octahedral Mo had been formed.37
To fabricate MoOx HTLs, patterned ITO substrates were first cleaned with detergent and then sequentially sonicated in deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min. The ITO substrates were further cleaned by UV/ozone treatment to improve their wettability. The Mo solutions with and without H2O2 were then spin-coated onto the pre-cleaned ITO substrates at 1000 rpm for 30 s. The samples were then annealed in air on a pre-heated hotplate at about 200 °C for 10 min to form the solution-processed MoOx-based HTLs. The films synthesized without and with H2O2 were defined as sMoOx_A and sMoOx_B, respectively. For comparison, 25 nm thick spin-coated PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus Clevios 4083, Heraeus, USA) and 20 nm thick eMoOx layers were also fabricated on clean ITO substrates for comparison with the solution-processed MoOx HTLs. The PEDOT:PSS HTLs were annealed at 110 °C in air.
PV10 (14 mg, Polyera, USA)48 and PC70BM (21 mg, Nano-C, USA) were dissolved at a weight ratio of 1:1.5 in ortho-dichlorobenzene (1 mL, anhydrous, 99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) with magnetic stirring at 80 °C for 24 h to form a PV10/PC70BM blend solution. This solution was spin-coated onto different HTLs (sMoOx_A, sMoOx_B, eMoOx and PEDOT:PSS) to form an active layer with a thickness of 200 nm and then dried inside a nitrogen-filled glove box without heating. A solution-processed ZnO ETL layer with a thickness of about 20 nm was spin-coated onto the surface of the active layer, as reported previously.49,50 Al (100 nm) was then evaporated onto the active layers through a shadow mask to define 12 devices with an area of 0.13 cm2 on each substrate.
XPS (JPS-9010, JEOL, Japan) was performed using monochromatized Mg Kα photons (1253.6 eV) with a resolution of 0.05 eV and an input power of 100 W (10 kV, 10 mA). Cross-sectional views of the samples were obtained by SEM (SU8020, Hitachi, Japan) at 5 kV and 10 mA. Before observation, the thin films were sputtered with Pt to minimize electron charging and to obtain clear images. The surface morphologies of the MoOx-based HTLs were investigated by AFM (Nanocute, SII Nano Technology, Japan) in the tapping mode. The examined MoOx thin films were fabricated on silicon surfaces and annealed at 200 °C for 10 min before imaging. The transparency of the MoOx-based films was measured by UV-vis spectrophotometry (V-670, Jasco, Japan) from 200 to 900 nm with a resolution of 2 nm. The photovoltaic characteristics of the devices were measured under a nitrogen atmosphere inside a glove box using a source meter (2602A, Keithley, USA) and a solar simulator (Sun 3000, Abet, USA) with 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G illumination.
