    , Accepted 8th October 2014First published on 14th October 2014AbstractThe effects of the spatial arrangement of the conjugated side chains of two-dimensional polymers on their optical, electrochemical, molecular-packing, and photovoltaic characteristics were investigated. Accordingly, novel polythiophenes with horizontally (PBTTTV-h) and vertically (PBTTTV-v) grafted terthiophene–vinylene (TTV) conjugated side chains were synthesized that display two and one UV-vis peaks, respectively; the difference is due to the different constitutions of the conjugated side-chains. Because the spatial arrangement affects the molecular self-assembly, PBTTTV-h shows stronger crystallinity than PBTTTV-v, which enhances the charge mobility in devices. Moreover, PBTTTV-h has a lower HOMO energy level (−5.49 eV) than PBTTTV-v (−5.40 eV). Bulk heterojunction solar cells fabricated from PBTTTV-h/PC71BM and PBTTTV-v/PC71BM exhibit power conversion efficiencies of 4.75% and 4.00%, respectively, and Voc values of 800 and 730 mV, respectively, under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). Thus, the architecture of the TTV conjugated side chains affects the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties; this study provides more ideas for improving 2-D conjugated polymers for semiconductor devices.
Introduction
Over the past few decades, conjugated polymers have been rapidly and intensively developed for applications in various types of organic electronics such as field effect transistors (FETs), photo-detectors, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and polymer solar cells (PSCs).1–7 PSCs, one of the most interesting organic electronics, have attracted enormous research interest from both academia and industry in recent years because they have the advantages of light weight, low material cost, good mechanical flexibility, and simplicity of manufacture; these characteristics lead to the potential realization of next-generation renewable energy sources.8–12
Among the π-conjugated polymers designed as electron-donor materials in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, polythiophene derivatives (PTs) have become the most common derivatives in PSCs because of their high charge mobility, strong absorption in the visible region, and synthetic accessibility.10,13–19 One of the most studied polythiophenes, i.e., regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rr-P3HT), has high hole mobility because of its highly oriented semicrystalline structure; however, its relatively high HOMO energy level limits the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of PSC devices.2,17 Therefore, the design and synthesis of highly crystalline PTs with broad absorption bands and low-lying HOMO energy levels are crucial for the fabrication of high-performance PSCs.
Many structural designs for novel, diverse, and functional conjugated PTs with low-lying HOMO energy levels, such as pull–push pairs and incorporation of conjugated side chains, have been reported.14 Conjugated polymers with conjugated side chains on the polymer backbone have been synthesized and are known as two-dimensional (2-D) conjugated polymers.14 The vinylene linkage between the polymer backbone and conjugated side chain in 2-D conjugated polymers enhances the coplanarity of the polymer backbone and extends the π-conjugation, resulting in broader absorption, higher hole mobility, and relatively low-lying HOMO energy levels.20,21 Li and co-workers reported the incorporation of several kinds of vinylene-linked conjugated side chains into polythiophene backbones, including thienylene–vinylene (TV),17,22–25 phenothiazine–vinylene (PV),26 and styryl–triphenylamine,27 to extend the π-electron delocalization. Moreover, Tang reported vinylene-linked chromophoric side chains attached to a polythiophene backbone to improve the light-harvesting properties and modify the energy levels of the polymers for PSC devices.20,28,29
Most previous studies have focused on the design of vinylene-linked 2-D PTs to generate type I TV unit,20,23,29,30 but less studies discuss about type II TV which is considered against elongation of the π-conjugation (Fig. 1). However, the different constitution of conjugated side chains will change the spatial arrangement and sequence of thiophene rings and thus influence the optical, electrochemical, and crystalline properties of 2-D PTs. Comparing the two regioisomeric structures of thienylene–vinylene, i.e., type I and type II, is interesting and valuable for the design of conjugated side chains in 2-D PTs.
 Fig. 1  Two types of thienylene-vinylene linkage in 2-D polythiophene. 
Herein, we design and synthesize two novel 2-D polythiophenes, i.e., PBTTTV-h and PBTTTV-v, with horizontally (type II) and vertically (type I) oriented terthiophene–vinylene (TTV) conjugated side chains, respectively, to elucidate the relationship between the isomer polymer structure and the physical properties.
Experimental section
Materials
Unless otherwise noted, all nonaqueous reactions were conducted under an atmosphere of nitrogen gas (N2) in an oven-dried apparatus. p-Xylene and 1,2-dichloroethane were dried over calcium hydride under N2 prior to use. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and diethyl ether were distilled over sodium/benzophenone prior to use. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) was dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) followed by barium oxide (BaO), and stored with molecular sieves in a round-bottom flask under an inert atmosphere. Flash chromatography was performed over silica gel (230–400 mesh).

PBTTTV-h

5,5′-Bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (196.7 mg, 0.40 mmol) was weighted into a 50 mL two neck round-bottom flask and subjected to three successive cycles of vacuum followed by refilling with nitrogen. Then monomer M1 (295.5 mg, 0.40 mmol) and Pd2dba3 (0.01 mmol)/P(o-tol)3 (0.02 mmol) were separately dissolved in anhydrous p-xylene and added into the reaction mixture via a syringe. The polymerization was carried out at reflux temperature for 48 h. The raw product was precipitated into methanol and collected through a Soxhlet thimble by filtration, which was then subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone, hexanes, cyclohexane and chloroform. The final polymer was recovered from the chloroform fraction by rotary evaporation as a purple solid and dried in vacuum for 12 h at 60 °C, yielding PBTTTV-h (215 mg, 72%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.2–6.4 (br, 8H), 2.7–2.1 (br, 4H), 1.5–0.6 (br, 30H).

Reaction of M2 (236.4 mg, 0.32 mmol) and 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (157.4 mg, 0.32 mmol) yielded PBTTTV-v (157 mg, 66%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.2–6.4 (br, 8H), 2.7–2.1 (br, 4H), 1.6–0.6 (br, 30H).
Characterization

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded using a 400 MHz on Bruker DRX-400 spectrometer. All NMR spectra were calibrated using chloroform-d (CDCl3) where 1H NMR chemical shifts of tetramethylsilane is 0 ppm or CDCl3 is 7.26 ppm; in addition, 13C NMR of CDCl3 is 77.0 ppm. The peak multiplicity was described as follows: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, p = pentet, dd = doublet of doublets, m = multiplet and br = broad. Low resolution electron ionization mass spectra (EI mass) were collected using a Finnigan TSQ 700 and low resolution electrospray ionization mass spectra (ESI mass) were collected using a THERMO Q Exactive Plus FINNIGAN and LCQ Mass Spectrometer. Ultraviolet-visible absorption (UV-vis) spectra were recorded on a JASCO MD-2010 spectrometer. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was conducted at 40 °C using two Jordi DVB mixed-bed columns (250 × 10 mm; suitable for separating polymers with molecular weights from 1 × 102 to 1 × 107 g mol−1) using THF as the eluent at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min−1 on a JASCO instrument that was equipped with UV-vis and refractive index (RI) detectors connected in series. The X-ray diffraction patterns were measured using a BRUKER D8 ADVANCED diffractometer operated at a voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.542 Å, scan rate: 0.8 s per step). Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was performed on CH Instruments CHI 614A with Pt, Pt plate, and Ag/Ag+ as working, counter and reference electrodes, respectively, in 0.10 M (n-Bu)4NPF6 acetonitrile at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. For calibration, the redox potential of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was measured under the same conditions. Theoretical molecular simulation of the studied polymers was calculated using a quantum mechanical package Gaussian 03. The molecular geometric structures of the dimers were optimized using the density functional theory method with the B3LYP functional and the 6-31G* basis set.
Device fabrication
The polymer solar cells (PSCs) were fabricated in a configuration of the traditional sandwich structure with an indium tin oxide (ITO) glass as the anode and a metal as the cathode. The ITO glasses were cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol for 20 min. Then PEDOT:PSS was filtered through a 0.2 μm filter and spin-coated at 3500 rpm for 30 s on top of the ITO electrode. Subsequently, the PEDOT:PSS film was baked at 140 °C for 10 min in the air, and then moved into a glovebox. The blend solution of PC71BM and synthesized polymers (PBTTTV-h and PBTTTV-v) in a chlorobenzene solvent was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter and spin-coated at 800 rpm for 30 s on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. These devices were thermally annealed at various temperatures for 10 min, followed by capping with Ca (∼20 nm) and then Al (∼60 nm) in a thermal evaporator at a base pressure of ca. 10−6 Pa. The active area of the devices is 0.06 cm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) measurements of the devices were conducted on a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit under AM1.5G simulated solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2. The light incident intensity was calibrated using a mono-Si reference cell with a KG5 filter (PV Measurements, Inc.), which was pre-calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The SCLC measurements were carried out using a Keithley 2400 source meter under dark conditions. The IPCE spectra were recorded under illumination by a xenon lamp and a monochromator (TRIAX 180, JOBIN YVON), and the light intensity was calibrated using an OPHIR 2A-SH thermopile detector.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of monomers and polymers

Scheme 1 depicts the synthetic routes to the two structural isomers of a conjugated brush-like polymer, i.e., PBTTTV-h and PBTTTV-v, which possess branched and linear (or horizontal and vertical) conjugated TTV side chains, respectively, and their parent monomers, M1 and M2. M1 and M2 were synthesized via the Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction of phosphonate and diisopropyl ((2,5-dibromothiophen-3-yl)methyl)phosphonate 4, which is the reaction product of 2,5-dibromo-3-(bromomethyl)thiophene and triisopropyl phosphite, with 4,4′′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-[2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene]-3′-carbaldehyde 2 or 4,4′′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-[2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene]-5-carbaldehyde 3, respectively. Two alkyl moieties, i.e., 2-ethylhexyl, were introduced into both monomers to enhance the solubility of the corresponding final polymers. Molecule 2 was synthesized by Stille-coupling of tributyl(4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)stannane and 2,5-dibromothiophene-3-carbaldehyde in the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(PPh3)4. A two-step process was employed to generate 3: the Stille reaction of tributyl(4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)stannane with 2,5-dibromothiophene yielded 1, which then underwent Vilsmeier formylation with POCl3. The use of a bulky phosphonate as a reagent for the Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons reaction not only enhanced the (E)-selectivity but also increased the yield. Coupling constants of ca. 16.0 Hz were observed in the 1H NMR spectra of both M1 and M2 (Fig. S13 and S14 in the ESI†); this clearly demonstrates that the E-isomer is the exclusive product for both monomers. Detailed characterization data for the monomers and intermediates are given in the ESI.†

The PBTTTV-h and PBTTTV-v polymers were prepared via Stille coupling of M1 and M2, respectively, with 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2′-bithiophene using Pd2dba3/P(o-tol)3 as the catalyst. Applying 2,2′-bithiophene as the comonomer reduced the steric hindrance of the bulky side chains on M1 and M2. The raw products were precipitated into methanol and collected through a Soxhlet thimble by filtration and then subjected to consecutive Soxhlet extractions with methanol, acetone, hexane, and cyclohexane to remove the small molecules and oligomers and finally with chloroform to obtain the target compounds. Both polymers have comparable yields of ca. 70% and exhibit good solubility in common solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform, chlorobenzene (CB), and o-dichlorobenzene (oDCB). Moreover, gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) analyses showed that the two polymers have very similar molecular weight characteristics with number-average molecular weights of around 27 kDa with respect to polystyrene standards (Table 1). The high solubility and high molecular weight are essentially due to the two branched 2-ethylhexyl chains on terthiophene.

Optical properties
The optical properties of the monomers and polymers were examined by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2(a), although M1 and M2 are structural isomers, the latter exhibited a significantly red-shifted absorption spectrum with a maximum at 420 nm; this indicates that the linear arrangement of the thiophene rings, as compared with the corresponding branched structure, effectively extended the conjugation length of the molecule. For the polymers, the dilute solution of PBTTTV-h synthesized from the branched monomer, M1, possessed two distinct absorption bands with comparable heights that encompassed wavelengths from 300 to 650 nm. The high-energy (short wavelength) band that peaked at ∼340 nm originated from the terthiophene side chain while the low-energy band that peaked at ∼530 nm corresponds to the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone. In contrast, the M2-derived polymer, PBTTTV-v, exhibited a broad absorption band that peaked at ∼443 nm with a weak shoulder peak at ∼540 nm, corresponding to the conjugated side chain and polymer main chain, respectively. It should be noted that the absorption coefficient at 530 nm of PBTTTV-h is 35.2 L g−1 cm−1 (see Fig. S26 in the ESI†), which is close to that of PBTTTV-v (32.5 L g−1 cm−1).

Fig. 2(b) shows that the spin-coated films of both polymers preserved similar absorption characteristics as their parent solutions. The low-energy band of the PBTTTV-h film was shifted by about 22 nm to the long-wavelength region corresponding to interchain association in the solid state and improved co-planarity of the backbone.32 After thermal treatment at 120 °C for 15 min, it underwent a further red-shift of ∼13 nm along with the formation of a small shoulder peak, which implies the self-organization of polymer main chains. On the other hand, a relatively small red-shift of ca. 7 nm was observed for the absorption maximum of the PBTTTV-v film; moreover, the thermal annealing process had little effect on shifting the peak position of the absorption band. These facts indicate that the spatial orientation of conjugated side groups is a decisive parameter affecting the packing behavior of polythiophenes and the vertically anchored TTV branches significantly lower the co-planarity of thiophene rings in the main chain and hinder the thermally driven self-organization of polymer backbones into an ordered structure. Additionally, the optical band-gaps determined from the onset absorption of the spectra of the PBTTTV-h and PBTTTV-v annealed films were 1.91 and 1.84 eV, respectively.
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of M1, M2, PBTTTV-h, and PBTTTV-v in a dilute CB solution were recorded at room temperature under excitation at their maximum absorption wavelengths. Fig. 3(a) shows that the dilute M1 solution under excitation at 330 nm exhibited a single emission band with a maximum intensity at ∼463 nm; the PBTTTV-h solution exhibited a red-shifted PL spectrum with a maximum intensity at ca. 634 nm as it is excited at 530 nm which is the absorption maximum wavelength corresponding to the conjugated backbone. Interestingly, as the PBTTTV-h solution is excited with a 330 nm incident light, its emission spectrum is different from that of M1 but completely overlaps with that of PBTTTV-h taken under 530 nm excitation. Similar behavior was also observed for the PBTTTV-v system. The PL of M2 under excitation at 420 nm showed two emission peaks at ca. 488 and 516 nm. On the other hand, both 460 nm and 530 nm excited PL spectra of the PBTTTV-v solution were red-shifted from that of its parent monomer, M2, with emission maximum peaks at ca. 657 and 661 nm, and overlap with each other over most wavelengths with a slight difference in the high-energy region. Such findings clearly indicate highly efficient intramolecular excitation energy transfer from the TTV conjugated side chains to the polymer backbone in these brush-like conjugated polymers.26,33,34 Although PBTTTV-v and PBTTTV-h have the same chemical structure in terms of the main chain, our UV-vis results demonstrate that the spatial arrangement of conjugated TTV branches considerably disturbs the conjugation length and chain conformation of the polymer backbone. Moreover, the optimized geometries of both polymers from DFT calculations indicate their theoretical electron-density distributions and energy levels are also affected by the geometry of side chains, as shown in Fig. 7. Therefore, a significant difference in the emission characteristics of the two polymers is understandable.

Thin-film crystallinity and charge-carrier mobility
The molecular organizations of these polymers in thin solid-state films were investigated using the X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique. As shown in Fig. 4, a broad, weak diffraction peak was detected for the PBTTTV-v film before and after thermal annealing, which reveals that it was an amorphous compound and the thermal motion of the molecules was insufficient to generate ordered polymer chains packing. Interestingly, the self-assembly behavior of such polymers can be tuned by varying the spatial arrangement of the terthiophene side chains on the polythiophene backbone. In contrast to most side chain-containing conjugated polymers, the as-cast film of PBTTTV-h exhibited a visible diffraction peak at 2θ = 3.79° (fitting figures are shown in Fig. S27 and S28, ESI†); thermal annealing of the film at 120 °C for 15 min substantially increased the intensity of this peak and shifted the diffraction angle to 2θ = 3.53°. These observations demonstrate that vertically grafted bulky terthiophenes may sterically hinder intra- and intermolecular alignment into a well-organized structure; however, terthiophene units that were horizontally oriented with respect to the backbone facilitated crystallization of the polymer chains into a lamellar structure.
 Fig. 4  X-ray diffraction patterns of the polymer films by as cast with/without annealing at 120 °C for 15 min. 
To gain insight into the crystalline structure, both the d-spacing parameter and grain size were determined from the diffraction peaks using Bragg's and Scherrer's equations,35 respectively. The results are summarized in Table 2. The PBTTTV-h lamellae in the as-cast film had a grain size of 16.2 nm with a d-spacing of 2.33 nm, which is larger than the reported lamellar d-spacing of P3HT (∼1.64 nm)36,37 because of the presence of bulky conjugated side chains between the polymer main chains in PBTTTV-h. Although the vertical size is larger in v-oriented TTV than in h-oriented TTV, the tilt angle of the side chain relative to the polymer backbone is also a decisive factor in determining the d-spacing of the lamellae. Tilting the side chain from the upright direction will result in the reduction of the lamellar distance. The XRD results in Table 2 reveal that PBTTTV-v and PBTTTV-h exhibit comparable d-space values. This is probably because the steric hindrance caused by the two alkylthienyl terminal groups in h-oriented TTV severely limits its maximum reachable tilting angle. Therefore, the PBTTTV-v has a wider angle distribution that lowers the average lamellar distance and the grain size of crystallite. Moreover, the annealing process effectively promotes the growth of crystals that results in a significant increment in grain size to 22.1 nm. The slight elongation in d-spacing is probably due to the thermal stretching of alkyl moieties on the TTV side chains.38,39

The hole mobilities of PBTTTV-h and PBTTTV-v were measured in a hole-only device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer sample/Au) using the space-charge–limited current (SCLC) method. For comparison, a control experiment on P3HT was also conducted. Fig. S24 (ESI†) shows a plot of the dependence of the measured current density on the applied voltage; the mobilities, which are listed in Table S5 (ESI†), were calculated according to the following formula:40  where J denotes the current density, εr is the dielectric constant of the organic molecule, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, L is the thickness of the active layer, V is the applied voltage, and E0 is the characteristic field. The hole mobility of pristine PBTTTV-h was determined to be 4.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is slightly greater than that of P3HT (3.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and about 1.5 times greater than that of PBTTTV-v (3.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1); therefore, it is evident that the formation of an ordered polymer-chain structure improved the carrier mobility of the polymer material.
Electrochemical properties and theoretical calculations
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energies were determined using cyclic voltammetry (CV); the results are shown in Fig. 5 and summarized in Table 3. CV measurements of as-cast films of the polymers on a Pt electrode were performed at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 in 0.10 M (n-Bu)4NPF6 acetonitrile solution as the electrolyte using a Pt plate as the counter electrode and a Ag/AgNO3 electrode as the reference electrode. The redox potentials were calibrated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as an external standard.41 The HOMO energies of the polymers were determined from their onset oxidation potentials (Eonset,ox) based on the onset oxidation potential of ferrocene (0.46 V, shown in the ESI†) as a reference, which is −4.8 V below the vacuum level, according to the following equation:42,43 HOMO = −e(Eonset,ox – E(Fc/Fc+) + 4.80) (eV). Then, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies were calculated using the optical band gap (Eoptg) and the calculated HOMO energies according to the following equation: LUMO = HOMO + Eoptg (eV).

The onsets of the oxidation waves for as-cast films of PBTTTV-h and PBTTTV-v were 1.15 and 1.06 V, respectively, which correspond to HOMO energy levels of −5.49 and −5.40 eV, respectively, and LUMO energy levels of −3.58 and −3.56 eV, respectively. The CV measurements revealed that both PBTTTV-h and PBTTTV-v had lower HOMO energies than rr-P3HT (ca. −5.0 eV); this would be beneficial for the fabrication of photovoltaic devices with high Voc values.
The CV results demonstrated that the HOMO energy of PBTTTV-v was higher than that of PBTTTV-h, probably because of the differences in the constitution of the conjugated side chain structures. In other words, comparison of the HOMO energies of PBTTTV-h and PBTTTV-v revealed that the different spatial arrangements of the terthiophene side chains affected the electron distribution in 2-D PTs. Therefore, we calculated the electron distribution in the molecular structure using density functional theory (DFT) to elucidate the electron delocalization on a molecule; for these calculations, two repeating units (n) were used, and the 2-ethylhexyl group was replaced with a methyl moiety for increased simplicity. Fig. 6 shows the optimized geometry of dimers of PBTTTV-h and PBTTTV-v calculated at the DFT/B3LYP/6-31G/d(p) level. The dihedral angles of the backbone in the optimized structures of PBTTTV-h and PBTTTV-v were similar, indicating that the planarities of their backbones were similar. In other words, the different constitutions of the TTV side chains did not significantly affect the planarity of the backbone.

Based on the optimized geometries, the results of the electron-density distributions and energy levels of the theoretical calculations are shown in Fig. 7 and the results are summarized in Table 3. The trends of variation of the calculated and experimental HOMO energy levels were consistent. More importantly, the conjugated TTV side chain decreased the HOMO energy level while the branched conjugated TTV side chain more effectively reduced the HOMO energy level than the linear one. These results provide a novel route to designing an ideal conjugated polymer with a suitable energy level for organic-semiconductor applications.

Photovoltaic properties
Although PBTTTV-h and PBTTTV-v are structural isomers and have similar molecular weights, they exhibited different light-absorption, self-assembly, and carrier-mobility characteristics. The abilities of the two polymers as electron-donating, hole-transporting, and light-harvesting materials were evaluated by constructing BHJ solar cells with the following configuration: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/polymer:PC71BM/Ca (20 nm)/Al (60 nm). The cell performance was optimized by varying the blending ratio of the polymer to PC71BM in the active layer and the temperature at which thermal annealing was executed. The J–V curves of these PBTTTV-h- and PBTTTV-v-based devices are presented in Fig. S22 and S23 (ESI†), respectively, and the corresponding photovoltaic data are summarized in Tables S1–S4 (ESI†). Fig. 8(a) shows J–V curves of the optimized PBTTTV-h/PC71BM and PBTTTV-v/PC71BM solar cells. The former device exhibited a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 9.10 mA cm−2, a Voc of 800 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 65.2%, leading to a promising PCE of 4.75%; in contrast, the latter device exhibited a comparable Jsc of 9.02 mA cm−2 and slightly lower Voc and FF values of 730 mV and 60.8%, respectively, leading to a PCE of 4.00%. For comparison, the PSC device based on P3HT/PC71BM was also fabricated under identical processing conditions. Its J–V curve is displayed in Fig. S29 (ESI†), exhibiting a Jsc of 9.03 mA cm−2, a Voc of 610 mV, and an FF value of 57.4% which is equivalent to a PCE of 3.16%. Obviously, both PBTTTV-h/PC71BM and PBTTTV-v/PC71BM devices have higher Voc and FF values and thereby better PCEs than those of the P3HT/PC71BM device, indicating that the structural design of TTV conjugated side chains is of benefit to the performance enhancement of polymer solar cells.
 Fig. 8  (a) J–V curves (b) IPCE spectra of optimized polymer/fullerene devices. 
Further to elucidate the origin of Jsc, the dependence of the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of both the solar cells on the wavelength of incident light was measured. Both EQE spectra cover a broad wavelength range 300–700 nm and had values greater than 50% between 360 and 600 nm, indicating good efficiency of photon-to-electron conversion. Moreover, the relative EQE values closely followed the relative light-harvesting capabilities of the two polymers; therefore, the PBTTTV-h/PC71BM cell had lower EQEs in the ∼300–450 nm region and higher EQEs in the ∼450–650 nm region than the PBTTTV-v/PC71BM cell. In addition, the integrated current densities determined from the EQE curves of the PBTTTV-h/PC71BM and PBTTTV-v/PC71BM devices with the AM1.5G solar spectrum were 9.8 and 7.0 mA cm−2, respectively, which agree well with the Jsc values determined from the corresponding J–V curves.
Importantly, because of the low-lying HOMO energy levels of these branched polythiophenes, the Voc values of the PBTTTV-h/PC71BM and PBTTTV-v/PC71BM solar cells substantially exceeded the commonly reported Voc (∼0.6 V) for devices based on linear poly(3-hexylthiophene). Basically, the Voc values of the two types of solar cells studied herein correlated with the relative magnitude of the HOMO levels of the corresponding polymer donors; therefore, the PBTTTV-h/PC71BM device exhibited a Voc that is ∼10% greater than that of the PBTTTV-h/PC71BM device. In addition, the former cell noticeably outperformed the latter cell in terms of FF because of reduced series resistance and enlarged shunt resistance, suggesting that the greater hole mobility of PBTTTV-h not only lowered the resistance to the transport of free holes in the active layer to the anode but also the recombination loss of the charge carriers. These findings demonstrate that the h-type spatial arrangement of TTV side chains was more effective in enhancing the Voc and FF values of BHJ solar cells than the common v-type configuration.
Conclusions
In summary, two novel polythiophenes with structurally isomeric TTV conjugated side chains, i.e., PBTTTV-h (branched) and PBTTTV-v (linear), were designed, synthesized, and applied in PSCs. The branched alkyl side chains significantly enhanced the solubility of the polymers, and the unsubstituted bithiophene moieties in the polymer backbone acted as spacers to improve the coplanarity and enhance absorption. Because of the different architectures of the TTV conjugated side chains, PBTTTV-h, which contained branched TTV side chains, displayed two distinct absorption peaks in its UV-vis spectrum and was a crystalline polymer, as verified by XRD, which leads to significantly higher charge mobility; in contrast, PBTTTV-v, which contained linear TTV side chains, showed a single absorption peak and was an amorphous material. The differences in the molecular spatial arrangement obviously affected the self-assembly and charge mobility of two-dimensional polythiophenes. Moreover, PTs with conjugated side chains decreased the HOMO energy level, and the branched conjugated TTV side chain more effectively reduced the HOMO energy level than the linear one. These results provide a novel route for designing ideal conjugated polymers with suitable energy levels for organic-semiconductor applications. PSCs based on PBTTTV-h/PC71BM displayed a PCE of 4.75% and a Voc of 800 mV, while those based on PBTTTV-v/PC71BM displayed a PCE of 4.00% and lower Voc of 730 mV under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). These results not only demonstrate that the different architectures of the TTV conjugated side chains effectively impact the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties but also provide potential ideas to improve 2-D conjugated polymers for semiconductor devices through structural isomers. Moreover, the molecular engineering approach, such as introducing pull–push pairs and the nature of alkyl side chains, of 2-D conjugated polymers based on PBTTTV-h would open a new way for developing high performance organic semiconductor materials.
