    , Accepted 21st February 2014First published on 24th February 2014AbstractVarious-sized arrays of CuO nanoleaves (NLs) were fabricated on a pyramid-textured c-Si wafer. The CuO NL/c-Si solar cells show a great increase of the optical absorption and a reduction of the reflectance in the 250–1250 nm wavelength range, compared to the reference one. The c-Si solar cell integrated with CuO NLs generates the graded index of refraction between the surface of Si and air, and improves the light utilization efficiency by increasing the light-trapping effect and forming resonant optical modes, which leads to multiple scattering of the incident light. In addition, the deposition of p-type CuO NLs on the surface of the Si wafer can form a CuO NL/c-Si junction and generate a built-in potential, which is beneficial for the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, leading to the minority carrier lifetime (τeff) increase from 5.7 to 15.0 μs. The CuO NL/c-Si structure reduces the optical loss, improves the carrier collection, and distinctly enhances the c-Si solar cell efficiency. The experimental results indicate that short-circuit current and power conversion efficiency of CuO NL/c-Si solar cells increase by 10.30% and 17.90%, respectively. The CuO NL/c-Si structure is expected to exceed the Shockley–Queisser limit of the single junction solar cells.
1. Introduction
It is well known that 90% of commercial PV modules manufactured worldwide are made of solar-grade Si owing to its high natural abundance, mature processing technology, and excellent reliability in solar cells.1–3 Commercial Si PV has been developed to convert sunlight into electricity at efficiencies around 18%. However, it is challenging for us to develop Si solar cells with higher efficiency. The main limiting factors for the conversion efficiency of Si solar cells are optical loss, recombination, and thermal or quantum losses.4–7 A large portion of the energy loss during solar-cell operation is attributed to the optical loss.8,9 The polished substrates reflect approximately 30–35% of incident sunlight for wavelengths corresponding to energies larger than the band gap of silicon due to the low absorption coefficient of silicon.10 Therefore, the optical loss of solar cells greatly affects their performances. Thus, an antireflection coating is especially important in Si solar cells.11–13 Besides, the carrier recombination is also a key limiting factor for the performance of Si solar cells. The easy recombination of photogenerated carriers with surface defects can lead to inferior cell efficiency.14–18 The array nanostructures, such as ZnO NWs,19–22 silicon nanowires,2,23 InP nanowires,24 In2O3 nanopushpins,25 and indium tin oxide nanowhiskers,26 not only improved light absorption via light trapping effects,27,28 but also facilitated the collection of the photocarrier,29 which opened up a new area in developing advanced functional materials, photo-voltage devices,30,31etc.
CuO is an environment-friendly oxide semiconductor material with a wide energy gap of ∼1.4 eV.32 As a p-type semiconductor,33 CuO nanoleaves with the excellent optical absorption capacity can generate the graded index of refraction between the surface of Si and air and form a CuO NLs (p-type)/Si (n-type) junction at the c-Si interface. So far, the optical properties of CuO nanostructures directly growing on the surface of c-Si solar cells have rarely been studied. In this study, we fabricated a various-sized array of CuO NLs on pyramid-textured c-Si solar cells. It is found that the characteristics of CuO nanoleaves offer broad-band light harvesting from visible to near infrared (IR) regions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the CuO NLs (p-type)/c-Si (n-type) junction can suppress the recombination of the photogenerated carriers and improve the open circuit voltage of Si solar cells. Therefore, CuO NL/c-Si solar cells can significantly increase the short-circuit current (Jsc) and enhance the power conversion efficiency. The cost effective and environmentally friendly technology can be easily applied to the industrial scale production of Si solar cells. The CuO NL/c-Si solar cells expected to exceed the Shockley–Queisser limit of the single junction solar cells.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a)–(d) show the surface morphologies of CuO NLs with different lengths, widths, and densities of NLs growing on pyramid-textured Si substrates.
 Fig. 1  Cross-sectional view of FESEM morphologies of the CuO NLs growing on pyramid-textured Si substrates for (a) 30 min; (b) 45 min; (c) 60 min and (d) 90 min, respectively. Inset: top view. 
The compact and uniform CuO NLs are vertically aligned on the pyramid-textured Si substrates. The CuO NLs become relatively longer upon the increase of the growth time. SEM indicates that the length of the NLs is between ∼200 and ∼363 nm, and their width is between 69 nm and 97 nm. The morphology of CuO NLs can be controlled by adjusting the thickness of the seed-layer and the corresponding growth parameters.
As shown in Fig. 2, CuO NLs have an average width of ∼69 nm, length of ∼200 nm, and density of ∼259 × 10−6 NLs per nm2 when the growth time is 30 min. With extending growth time, the length of NLs increases steadily, the width of CuO NLs remains almost unchanged, and the NL density shows a small decrease due to the increase of lengths and the dissolution of small NLs. As the growth time is prolonged to 60 min, the length of CuO NLs is increased to ∼363 nm, and the density is decreased to ∼122 × 10−6 NLs per nm2.

The XRD patterns in Fig. 3 indicate that the as-prepared product is monoclinic CuO nanocrystalline. Two strong diffraction peaks at 35.50° and 38.73° can be indexed to {−111} and {111} of monoclinic CuO crystals (JCPDS card no. 49-0937) and indicate that CuO NLs have a well crystallinity. It can also be found that a longer reaction time results in a stronger diffraction peak for CuO NLs. The pyramid-textured Si has a strong diffraction peak at 69.13°, corresponding to the monocrystalline Si structure. With the growth of CuO NLs, this Si peak becomes gradually wider. Also, no characteristic peaks of impurities were detected in the pattern.

The growth of CuO NLs involves an evolution of the structural complexity from 0-D nanoparticles to 1-D nanorods, and then to 2-D ‘nanoleaf’ structures. The original attachment goes through all of these processes with the help of the CuO seeds. The two peaks at 35.50° and 38.73° become stronger as the time increases. This result indicates that Cu2+ and O2− ions grow crosswise and fuse into each other with crystallographic orientation of (111) and (−111) planes to form 1-D nanorods first, and then tend to align sequentially with each other perpendicular to the [111] direction. Then, the 1-D nanorods are parallel to each other to form 2-D CuO NLs.
Generally speaking, the c-Si wafer cannot sufficiently absorb all sunlight photons for wavelengths corresponding to energies larger than the band gap of silicon. In this study, we found that optical absorption (as shown in Fig. 4a) of the c-Si solar cells with CuO NLs is greatly increased in the wavelength range between 250 and 1250 nm, compared to the reference one. Obviously, the enhancement of optical absorption will result in the improvement of light utilization efficiency. In addition, this array structure can cause optical resonance and multiple scattering of the incident light between the CuO NLs, which can effectively absorb and trap incident light at their optically resonant wavelengths. So, most light in the investigated wavelength range can be captured by the c-Si wafer integrated with CuO NLs due to the broad band absorption and light scattering of the CuO NLs. With prolonging the length of the nanoleaves, the absorption gradually increases and the reflectance gradually decreases due to the light-scattering enhancement effect of CuO nanostructures. Besides, the surface area of the wafer becomes larger with increasing length of NLs, which is beneficial to the absorption. When the growth time is increased from 60 to 90 min, the length of the CuO NLs only increases a little. It means that the absorption and light-trapping almost reach the limit. If the CuO NLs are too long, an excessive surface defect promotes recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes into CuO NLs and suppresses the power conversion efficiency of the CuO NL/c-Si solar cells. With CuO NLs growing for 90 min, the reflectivity of the CuO NL/c-Si solar cells decreases from 17.18 to 9.7%, compared to the bare Si wafer, which show a relative improvement of almost 43% (as shown in Fig. 4b). The CuO NLs growing on the pyramid-textured c-Si provide broad band reflection suppression with very little wavelength dependence, which allows a gradual and continuous change of the effective refractive index from Si to air, and improves the optical impedance matching at the interfaces. Consequently, the CuO NLs as a graded index layer within the hierarchical structure can effectively eliminate the Fresnel reflection over the broad spectral width. The reflectivity of CuO NL/c-Si solar cells decreases with increasing length of the NL array.

The performances of CuO NL/c-Si solar cells were characterized by the J–V curves under the condition of AM 1.5 illumination (as shown in Fig. 5a). The main photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. All the photovoltaic parameters of the optimized CuO NL/c-Si solar cells have a distinct enhancement, compared to the one without CuO NLs.

The characteristics of short-circuit current density (Jsc) demonstrate the enhancement of the CuO NL/c-Si solar cells from 27.36 to 30.20 mA cm−2, compared to the reference one. The short-circuit current density is proportional to the conversion efficiency from incident photons to electrical current. The increase of short-circuit current density is ascribed to the absorption enhancement and the reflectance decline. When the CuO NLs were deposited on pyramid-textured Si substrates, the composite structure is beneficial to light-trapping and reduces the reflectivity, which can increase the concentrations of effective photons and then enhance the photocurrent of the cells. However, when the growth time increases from 60 to 90 min, Jsc starts to decrease slightly. It indicates that not all of the absorbed photons can be effectively converted to electric energy.
The open circuit voltage (Voc) exhibits an increase from 0.559 to 0.566 V for c-Si solar cells integrated with CuO NLs, and the power conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic device enhances from 9.39 to 11.07%, compared to the reference one. Fig. 5b shows that PCE and Jsc are consistently changeable with the length of CuO NLs, while the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and FF are essentially independent of the length of CuO NLs.
The experimental results show that the CuO NL/c-Si junction solar cells can suppress the recombination of charge carriers, improve the carrier collection, and increase the photoelectric conversion efficiency. The p-type CuO NLs and n-type Si interface form a p–n junction, which is beneficial for the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes under the action of the built-in potential formed by the CuO NL/c-Si junction. Fig. 6b shows the p–n–p junction model; the CuO NL thin film acts as a light-transmitting p-type emitter, and photocarriers are separated under the action of the built-in potential formed by the CuO/c-Si structure and easily transmit into the Si junction from the conduction band of CuO NLs. Each NL in the array direction can form a p–n–p junction with the c-Si substrate, acting as a tiny solar cell, in which the photogenerated carriers transport fast along the long axis, and only have to travel across a short pathway to reach the charge-separating junction. Fig. 6a shows the comparison of minority carrier lifetimes of CuO NLs with different lengths. Upon growth of CuO NLs on the surface of the c-Si wafer, surface recombination is very effectively suppressed, and τeff is substantially increased from 5.7 to 15.0 μs. However, when the length of the CuO NLs is continuously increased, the surface area increases, which induces more defect or minority carrier recombination centers at the c-Si surface. Besides, the diffusion path length of minority carrier transfers in the NLs along the vertical direction also increases. As a result, recombination in the transfer process increases, leading to poor interface charge carrier collection efficiency, which offsets the improvement of light-trap effects. The CuO NL/c-Si structure can not only improve optical utilization, but also facilitate the photocarrier collection. Therefore, we should consider the conflicting factors to reduce surface recombination and improve the light-trapping effectiveness for longer CuO NLs. In order to achieve the optimal power conversion efficiency, the CuO NL lengths were adjusted to find an optimal length. Appropriately long CuO NLs can make the Si solar cells perform well.

3. Experimental
Slices (3.0 × 3.0 cm2) of c-Si wafers without Si3N4, which purchased from Changzhou Yijing Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd, were applied in this work. The thickness of wafers is 200 μm with a bulk p–n junction. The resistivity of the Si wafers is in the range of 1–10 Ω cm. The surfaces of wafers were first cleaned to eliminate any metal impurities and organic contents. All the chemical reagents were purchased from Aladdin and used without further purification. The aqueous solutions were prepared using double distilled water. 10 mM copper acetate monohydrate [Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O, AR] in ethanol was prepared as the A solution (the seed solution). 0.02 M copper nitrate trihydrate [Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, AR] and 0.02 M hexamethylenetetramine (HTMA, AR) in water were prepared as the B solution (the growth solution).
The surface morphology and size distribution of vertically aligned CuO nanoleaves were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy [FESEM, S-4800 Hitachi]. The absorption and reflection spectra of the CuO NL/c-Si wafer samples were recorded using a Varian Carry 500 UV/vis/NIR spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere (Labsphere) in the wavelength range of 250–1250 nm, which corresponds to the major spectral irradiance of sunlight. The minority carrier lifetime of the samples was measured using a Si wafer life-time WT-2000 PVN. A Keithley (Cleveland, OH) 2440 5 A source meter was used to obtain the current–voltage characteristics of the fabricated solar cells with and without coating of CuO nanoleaves. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was employed for evaporation of Al on the reverse side of the c-Si substrates; Ag grids were then screen-printed on the front side, followed by rapid thermal annealing. The total cell area measured is 9 cm2. A solar simulator [ABET TECHNOLOGIES, AM 1.5G, 1000 W m−2] was used for illumination during the measurements. The light intensity was calibrated with a silicon standard cell (PV Measurements, Inc.).
CuO nanoleaves on pyramid-textured c-Si substrates were synthesized by a two-step method. CuO nanoseed particles were first deposited on the surface of the Si substrate via an alcohothermal method. The A solution was spin-coated onto the surface of the single-crystalline Si substrate at 1600 rpm, and then was heated at 120 °C for a minute to dry. The above steps were repeated several times to obtain high-density growth of CuO nanoparticles. Then, the Si substrate was transferred into a regular laboratory oven for the annealing process at 250 °C in air for 30 min to obtain a uniform CuO nanoseed layer; 10 nm thick CuO films as the seed layers were obtained. The second step is to grow CuO NLs from the seeded Si substrates. The pre-seeded substrates were dipped into the B solution in a vertical position and then heated to 90 °C for 30–90 min; HMTA can produce ammonia, and further it hydrolyzes to provide OH−, which reacts with copper nitrate, leading to the production of insoluble copper hydroxides. All the synthesis process was performed under atmospheric pressure. The final product obtained on the pyramid-textured Si substrate was washed with deionized H2O several times to remove any residual salts or amine complexes.
4. Conclusions
In summary, CuO NLs growing on the pyramid-textured Si have been demonstrated to have promising potential for improving the efficiency of c-Si solar cells. This study shows that the CuO NL/c-Si solar cells can significantly enhance the power conversion efficiency. The enhancement is attributed to the enhanced absorption and trapping of sunlight, and generation of the graded index of refraction between the surface of Si and air. The CuO NL/c-Si structure can form a p–n junction at their interface which is beneficial for the spatial separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, besides, the carrier collection efficiency can be improved as well. Those superior photovoltaic properties of CuO NL/c-Si solar cells can be realized by a simple, low-temperature process, which showed great potential for low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells, expanded the application of copper oxide on Si solar cells by directly depositing it on the pyramid-textured Si surface and provided a potential new photovoltaic technology. The CuO NL/c-Si structure is expected to exceed the Shockley–Queisser limit of the single junction solar cells.
