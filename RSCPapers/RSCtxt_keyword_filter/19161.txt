    , Accepted 18th January 2022First published on 18th January 2022AbstractThe recent discovery of the photovoltaic (PV) effect in indium(I) iodide thin films has attracted considerable attention, as this material can be a feasible environment-friendly alternative to the conventional lead halide perovskites. Previously published computational and spectroscopy data suggested that InI could deliver photovoltaic performances comparable to complex lead iodides; this prediction, however, was not supported by a recent experimental study. To address this contradiction, herein we evaluated systematically the potential of InI as a semiconductor material for photovoltaic applications. The solar cells assembled with InI as a light absorber material demonstrated modest power conversion efficiency of 1%. However, the lateral two-terminal devices showed a rather outstanding photoconductivity effect, which we utilized to fabricate photodetectors demonstrating a competitive performance: photodetectivity approaching 1.4 × 103, specific detectivity of 5.0 × 1011 Jones, and maximum pulse frequency of 93.6 kHz. Similar devices assembled in the vertical geometry delivered much inferior performance. GIWAXS analysis revealed that InI films are strongly textured and grow with the crystallographic b-axis oriented perpendicular to the substrate, which means that the layers composed of interconnected In and I atoms are lying parallel to the substrate. The estimated effective charge carrier lifetimes in lateral and vertical devices (2 ms and 15 ms, respectively) confirmed that their strikingly different performances are due to the structural and electronic anisotropy of InI films. The obtained results reveal the importance of the structural dimensionality of the newly designed semiconductor materials: truly 3D structures are required to match complex lead halides in terms of their optoelectronic properties. On the contrary, materials with lower dimensionality, such as 2D InI, could provide excellent performance in lateral photodetector devices, whereas their efficient use in vertical geometry cells would require changing the preferential film growth direction, which is a solvable but a very nontrivial task.
Introduction
The success in the development of perovskite solar cells, demonstrating now power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of >25%, is compromised by the toxicity of complex lead halides used as active materials in these devices.1 The complex tin halides, which are considered more environmentally friendly, provide inferior photovoltaic performances and show intrinsically low photostability.2 Therefore, there is an ongoing quest to develop new Pb-free absorbers for perovskite solar cells. Apart from the Pb2+ and Sn2+ halides, promising results were shown by materials with 3D connectivity patterns in the crystal lattice, such as AgaBibIa+3b rudorffites,3 Sb(V) complexes (ASbX6),4 and double perovskites (e.g. Cs2AgBiX6),5 by halides with reduced structural dimensionality, such as the vacancy-ordered A2A′n−1BnX3n+3 (B = Bi3+ and Sb3+)6–8 and A2BX6 (B = Sn4+ and Ti4+)9,10 families, and by Ruddlesden–Popper phases of A2A′n−1Cu(II)nX3n+111,12 and trigonal type AGeX3.13 The efficiencies of photovoltaic cells assembled with these perovskite-like materials still do not reach much beyond 4% due to issues with structural and electronic properties.14
Besides the structural resemblance to perovskites, Brandt et al. recently identified a set of design criteria for new light absorbers, featuring InI as an exceptionally promising material, which could deliver optoelectronic characteristics comparable to the complex lead halide complexes.15 This hypothesis was experimentally supported by the observation of a high defect tolerance and long carrier lifetimes in this material.16 Following these theoretical and spectroscopy studies, InI, earlier known as a material for scintillators and gas discharge lamps,17–20 was evaluated as an absorber material in solar cells and yielded a modest PCE of 0.39%.21 This inferior photovoltaic performance of InI was attributed to the high density of defects in thin films of the material, leading to a suppressed carrier transport.
It should be emphasized that InI has a layered structure, which unavoidably results in highly non-isotropic charge transport properties within the material. Other binary halides with similar layered structures such as BiI3 also demonstrated a photovoltaic effect with modest device efficiencies of ∼1%, which could be a consequence of the low structural dimensionality.22,23 Still, the interlayer distances in InI are considerably shorter as compared to the aforementioned binary iodides, which suggests that InI could behave as a quasi-3D material.24 However, this hypothesis was not supported experimentally: a recent study of the charge distribution in an InI lattice suggested weak interlayer interactions, resembling that in graphite, whereas the charge transport within 2D layers is very efficient.25 Indeed, the lateral two-terminal devices based on ultrathin b-oriented 2D InI flakes functioned as photodetectors with good characteristics.26 However, a previous study suggested that the best device characteristics could be obtained by applying a bias in the vertical direction along the crystallographic b-axis due to high interlayer diffusion barriers preventing migration of In+ and I− vacancies.24
To summarize the aforementioned discussion, there is a strong controversy between the theoretically predicted properties of InI absorber films and the results of the first reported experimental studies. Herein, we performed a systematic assessment of the photovoltaic properties of InI thin films in both vertical and lateral two-terminal devices. Using several complementary techniques, we show that low structural dimensionality is the key reason why InI shows modest performance in solar cells (vertical device geometry) but demonstrates excellent characteristics in two-terminal photodetectors (lateral device structure).
Results and discussion
Coating InI thin films from solution is challenged by the extremely low solubility of this material in organic solvents. However, InI sublimes in a vacuum without decomposition,27 which makes it possible to use the physical vapor deposition (PVD) method for growing the absorber films. The PVD-processed films of InI have a brown color with a pink or red shine; the low-energy absorbance band edge at 620 nm (Fig. 1a) indicates the same bandgap of ∼2.0 eV as for bulk single crystals.28 X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the presence of pure InI phase, strongly textured in the b-orientation as concluded from the strongly dominating (040) peak as compared to the simulated single-crystal XRD pattern (Fig. 1b).

(b) The XRD pattern of InI thin films on a glass substrate compared to the simulated pattern based on single crystal diffraction data. (c) GIWAXS pattern of the InI thin film showing the position of the (111) reflection (3.07 Å). (d) Orientation of the orthorhombic indium(I) iodide lattice relative to the substrate. 
The two-dimensional pattern of grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) of the InI thin film exhibits the reflection with the azimuthal position of 57° from a meridian (Fig. 1c), which corresponds to the d-spacing of 3.07 Å matching the gap between the layers in the InI lattice((111) reflection in the XRD pattern). This finding implies that the crystallographic b-axis is indeed oriented perpendicular to the substrate. In other words, the InI layers are parallel to the substrate; therefore such a structure enables efficient lateral conductivity and is likely less favorable for vertical charge transport (Fig. 1d).
We applied thermal annealing under inert atmosphere conditions to improve the crystallinity of InI films. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images revealed a much more ordered structure for the films annealed at 175 °C for 5 min. Annealing the films at the higher temperature of 225 °C resulted in the formation of multiple defects, which represent pinholes as shown in Fig. 2. Interestingly, the InI grain size remained almost constant upon annealing and ranged between 50 and 100 nm. The optimal annealing of InI films at 175 °C was crucial for achieving improved performance characteristics in devices using InI absorber films.

We also found that InI thin films degrade in direct contact with such common charge-transport interlayers as SnO2, ZnO, NiOx and PEDOT:PSS, in particular at elevated temperatures of >100 °C, which is manifested in strong film clouding and partial discoloration. In this context, using a PC61BM (phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) passivation interlayer between the InI and SnO2 layers results in the formation of a stable interface and improved device characteristics (Table S1, ESI†).
To avoid such absorber material degradation issues, the solar cells were assembled using the vertical device geometry ITO/SnO2/PC61BM/InI/PTA/MoO3/Ag, where PTA is poly[bis(4-phenyl)(4-methylphenyl)amine], frequently used for the fabrication of efficient perovskite solar cells.29,30 The champion cells showed almost hysteresis-free J–V curves and the encouraging PCE of ∼1.0%, VOC of 540 mV, Jsc of 3.8 mA cm−2, and FF of 51% (Fig. 3a). The best devices also showed external quantum efficiency (EQE) values of 45% in the range of 380–420 nm (Fig. 3b).

The relatively low efficiency of the devices fabricated using InI absorber films could result from a high number of trap states in the material or from improper energy level alignment in the device architecture leading to the formation of barriers for extraction of positive and/or negative charge carriers. These aspects were analyzed using a combination of UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (IPES) (Fig. S1, ESI†). The ionization energy (IE) and electron affinity (EA) determined for the InI film were 5.38 and 3.72 eV, respectively. The difference between the IE and EA of 1.66 eV is considerably lower than the intrinsic material bandgap of 2.0 eV. This could be due to the experimental broadening of the measurement (especially in the case of IPES), or be caused by the presence of defect-related tail states (Fig. S1, ESI†) beyond the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) of the InI films. Based on previous UPS and IPES data,21 the CBM of InI is expected to be slightly higher (3.6 eV) and the VBM should be slightly lower (5.6 eV) than identified. The presence of traps is also evident from the reduced EQE values under the light bias, though charge carrier recombination at the trap states does not affect the photocurrent density severely (Fig. 3b).
In the context of the energy level alignment, it seems that the selected charge transport interlayers are quite optimal since the CBM offset at the PC61BM/InI interface and VBM offset at the InI/PTA junction are minimal (Fig. 3c). Thus, the obtained results suggest that the inferior photovoltaic performance of the InI thin films could be assigned to either the presence of deep trap states as concluded previously21 or to the anisotropic properties of this material and the resulting hindered charge transport in the vertical direction with respect to the substrate.
We compared the photoresponse of InI-based devices fabricated in vertical and lateral geometries. The main device parameters recorded at the optimal conditions are presented in Table 1, whereas the dependences of the photodetectivity (P), responsivity (R), and specific detectivity (D) on the bias voltage and incident light power are presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†).

While analyzing the current–voltage characteristics recorded in the dark and under illumination, we paid particular attention to the first quadrant, where the photoconductivity effect could be manifested (Fig. 4a–d) (the experimental details are given in the ESI†). Here, a much stronger photoconductivity effect is observed in lateral PV devices, since the ratio of light and dark currents, i.e. photodetectivity, approaches an impressive value of 1.4 × 103 (under 27 mW cm−2 illumination), which is comparable to the photodetectivity of lateral and vertical MAPbI3 photodetectors (∼103–104).31,32

(c and d) Light and dark current–voltage characteristics. (e and f) Transient characteristics of the devices measured using 466 nm LED illumination with 80 mW ms−1 incident power. 
The cells fabricated in the vertical geometry showed only 1 order of current enhancement under 100 mW cm−2 illumination (Fig. 4c and d). The lateral two-terminal devices have shown also more than two orders of magnitude higher specific detectivity compared to the vertical devices (Table 1).
Both types of devices demonstrated decent transient characteristics with the response (trise) and decay (tdecay) times being below 1.6 ms (Fig. 4e and f). The magnitude of the photocurrent response signal showed a linear dependence on the bias voltage (Fig. S3, ESI†). Both vertical and lateral geometry devices could effectively detect a sequence of the 466 nm light-emitting diode pulses modulated at low frequencies such as 1 or 133 Hz (Fig. S4, ESI†).
To assess an effective charge carrier lifetime (τ0), the photoresponse of the InI-based photovoltaic cells was measured with different load resistances (RLoad) integrated into the circuit (Fig. S5, ESI†). Assuming that there is only linear charge carrier recombination and the voltage photoresponse decays exponentially (∼e−t/RLoadC), similar to the capacitor (C) discharge in the equivalent circuit of the photodetector, the following equation could be used to correlate the τ value, which is the experimental voltage decay time by the factor of e ≈ 2.718 and RLoadC time constant:1/τ = 1/τ0 + 1/(RLoadC)
Charge carrier lifetime τ0 and the device capacities for both geometries are determined from the intercept and the slope of the 1/τ dependence plotted versus 1/RLoad, respectively (Fig. S6, ESI†). The performed analysis revealed that the charge carrier lifetime in lateral InI photodetectors (τ0 = 2 ms) is considerably shorter compared to that of the vertical geometry devices (τ0 = 15 ms). Furthermore, the lateral photodetector has a lower capacity (C), which enables a much higher cut-off frequency, assessed as f = 1/(3RLoadC) at different RLoad, compared to the vertical type devices (Table S2, ESI†).
Despite the slow degradation of InI upon exposure to oxygen and moisture,27 InI devices showed a stable photoresponse after 1 month of storage in air.
Conclusions
To summarize, we were able to grow highly ordered polycrystalline InI thin films using physical vapor deposition. XRD and GIWAXS analysis revealed a preferential orientation of the crystalline b axis normal to the film surface with closely packed InI layers lying parallel to the substrate. The photovoltaic properties of the grown films were systematically evaluated in the devices with vertical and lateral geometries. The vertical-type solar cells delivered a modest efficiency of 1.0% and EQE of up to 45% at short wavelengths. On the contrary, the lateral InI-based two-terminal devices have demonstrated an impressive photoconductivity effect, which enabled the fabrication of photodetectors with competitive characteristics: photodetectivity of 1.4 × 103, specific detectivity of 5.0 × 1011, and cut-off frequency of up to 93.6 kHz.
Both the superior photoelectrical characteristics and much shorter effective charge carrier lifetimes (τ0), observed for the lateral two-terminal devices compared to the vertical geometry cells, suggest that the photovoltaic performance of InI films is limited mainly by their structural anisotropy. Indeed, the charge carriers can move freely within the 2D layers of the material, thus enabling the excellent performance of the lateral devices, whereas hindered transport in the vertical direction between the layers explains the modest characteristics of the standard solar cells. Similar findings were reported previously for low-dimensional complex Bi(III) halides, whose electrical performance also depends strongly on the structure dimensionality and the orientation of the metal halide frameworks with respect to the substrate as summarized in Table S3, ESI.†6,33
The obtained results point towards the crucial importance of structural dimensionality, which should be considered as one of the key parameters for the evaluation of prospective new absorber materials. Lead halide perovskites have a truly 3D structure and therefore anisotropic optoelectronic characteristics, which are desired for the design of successful future lead-free materials.
