    , Accepted 4th December 2015First published on 7th December 2015AbstractAn unsymmetrical subphthalocyanine trimer consisting of three different subphthalocyanine units was synthesized. Its optical and physical properties were investigated by UV/Vis, fluorescence spectrometry, cyclic voltammetry and computations. Energy transfer from the non-substituted subphthalocyanine unit to the perfluorinated subphthalocyanine unit via a trifluoroethoxy substituted unit is suggested.
Subphthalocyanines (SubPcs) are concave macrocycles with a unique curved 14-π-conjugated system.1 Similar to their larger homologues of phthalocyanines (Pcs),2 SubPcs are expected to serve as functional dyes and pigments for applications in devices such as organic solar cells, optical storage and others due to their unique structural, electronic, and optical properties. In addition to their utility as functional dyes, they are also attractive as molecular cages and flasks.3 The convex–concave interaction of SubPcs and fullerenes has been reported.4 In contrast to the flat-shaped π-conjugated macrocycles of Pcs, SubPcs show a higher tendency of non-aggregation which improves their solubility in organic solvents. These unique properties are likely to be related to their curved π-conjugation system and bowl-like geometry.5 Recent encouraging progress of SubPcs as an alternative to fullerene6 and a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 8.4% were achieved as fullerene-free organic solar cells.7 A fluorinated SubPc fused dimer, when used as an electron acceptor in an organic solar cell, showed 4% efficiency.8 In this context, we are interested in the design and synthesis of novel SubPc derivatives as novel materials for organic solar cells. In 2010, we reported the synthesis of a trifluoroethoxy (CF3CH2O, TFEO)-coated SubPc and disclosed its considerable efficiency for an axial ligand substitution reaction with a variety of oxygen nucleophiles.9 This substitution reaction was next applied to the synthesis of a SubPc homodimer and heterodimers having hydroquinine as a linker.10 It should be noted that a distinct energy/electron transfer process was observed in the heterodimers, and TFEO-SubPc acted as an electron acceptor, while non-substituted SubPc (H-SubPc) acted as a donor in the process. As an extension of this research, we were interested in the unsymmetrical SubPc trimer 1 consisting of three different SubPc moieties, H-SubPc, TFEO-SubPc and perfluorinated SubPc (F-SubPc), which is expected to indicate the step-wise continuous electron transfer process from the H-SubPc moiety to F-SubPc and/or F-SubPc via TFEO-SubPc units according to their degrees of donor/acceptor properties. These step-wise continuous electron transfer processes would attract chemists as tools for development of novel electron/energy transfer systems as well as photocatalysis for organic reactions.7,8,11,14 We report herein the design and synthesis of unsymmetrical, axially linked SubPc trimer 1 connected with phloroglucinol (Fig. 1). The stepwise constriction of 1 from a monomer or dimer to trimer using our TFEO-axial activation method and Torres's silver triflate method11 is the key for the success of this preparation. A spectrophotometric and electrochemical investigation of trimer 1 and the computations of each SubPc unit suggested electron transfer from the H-SubPc units to F-SubPc and/or F-SubPc via TFEO-SubPc.
 Fig. 1  Subphthalocyanine axial trimer 1 and expected energy transfer. 
Unsymmetrical SubPc trimer 1 having different substituents at each peripheral position of the SubPc unit, such as –OCH2CF3, –F and –H, was designed based on a previous observation using SubPc hetero dimers. The synthesis of SubPc trimer 1 is shown in Scheme 1. First, the axial substitution of TFEO-SubPc 2a with 1 equiv. of phloroglucinol was carried out under our previous conditions to provide phloroglucinol-attached TFEO-SubPc 4 in 22% yield. Next, we attempted the connection of F-SubPc 2b and 4 under reflux conditions providing dimer 5, but the reaction did not preceded since F-SubPc 2b showed poor axial reactivity. Thus the axial substitution of F-SubPc 2b was performed after activating its axial position by silver triflate, i.e., the Torres method, to furnish the corresponding unsymmetrical dimer 5 in 24% yield. Finally, the axial substitution reaction of H-SubPc 2c was performed using the Torres method to afford the desired trimer 1 in 46% yield (Scheme 1). Trimer 1 showed high solubility in common organic solvents and was purified by column chromatography on a silica gel. It was characterized by 1H and 19F-NMR, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and FTIR spectroscopy. The 1H NMR spectra of trimer 1 showed unique peaks at 2.6, 2.8 and 2.9 ppm corresponding to three protons of the central benzene ring which are strongly shielded by the diatropic magnetic currents of three different SubPc moieties. Other peaks corresponding to outlying trifluoroethoxy substituents of the TFEO-SubPc unit appeared between 4.5 ppm and 5.2 ppm, and an outlying proton of H-SubPcs appeared around 7.9 ppm and 8.7 ppm. The 19F NMR spectrum of trimer 1 showed two types of fluorine peaks according to the peaks of trifluoroethoxy substituents of the TFEO-SubPc unit around −75 ppm and outlying fluorine substituents of the F-SubPc unit around −137 ppm and −140 ppm. The MALDI-TOF MS spectrum of trimer 1 showed a peak split with a characteristic isotopic pattern corresponding to its molecular ion.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of SubPc trimer 1: (a) phloroglucinol (5.0 equiv.), triethylamine (4.0 equiv.), toluene, reflux, 22%; (b) F-SubPc 2b (1.2 equiv.), silver trifluoromethanesulfonate (1.5 equiv.), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (1.5 equiv.), toluene, 24%; (c) H-SubPc 2c (2.0 equiv.), silver trifluoromethanesulfonate (3.0 equiv.), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (3.0 equiv.), toluene, 46%. 
The optical feature of trimer 1 was next investigated. The UV/Vis spectra of trimer 1 were recorded in dioxane and trifluorotoluene, and a concentration range of 1 × 10−6 M to 1 × 10−4 M was examined (Fig. 2). Trimer 1 is present mainly as monomers irrespective of the concentration and is characterized by sharp absorption bands in the B- (335 nm) and Q-band (600 nm) regions. Trimer 1 showed a weak peak at 600 nm (εmax [10−5 M] = 4.5 × 104) and a stronger absorption peak at 566 nm (εmax [10−5 M] = 1.0 × 105) in the Q-band region in dioxane. The longer wavelength peak originates in absorption of the TFEO-SubPc unit and the shorter wavelength peak consists of two interlaced peaks corresponding to F-SubPc and H-SubPc. The shape of the absorption spectrum is formed by summing up the absorption spectra of TFEO-SubPc (λmax = 603 nm, εmax [10−5 M] = 8.7 × 104), F-SubPc (λmax = 572 nm, εmax [10−5 M] = 6.3 × 104) and H-SubPc (λmax = 564 nm, εmax [10−5 M] = 4.4 × 104). These results also suggest that three subphthalocyanine units absorb light independently and do not disturb any π system. The characteristics of the absorption spectra of trimer 1 in trifluorotoluene were almost the same as those in dioxane.

The steady-state fluorescence spectrum of trimer 1 was recorded in dioxane and trifluorotoluene (Fig. 3). Trimer 1 showed two weak emission peaks at 582 nm and 614 nm upon excitation at 530 nm in dioxane. The emission peak at the lower energy originates in the emission of TFEO-SubPc and the emission at the higher energy occurs from the F-SubPc unit in dioxane. Moreover, the emission peak contributed by the H-SubPc unit was buried in the emission band from the F-SubPc unit. On the other hand, the emission peak of the H-SubPc unit (576 nm) was observed in addition to the peak of the TFEO-SubPc unit (615 nm) in trifluorotoluene by reducing the emission peak of the F-SubPc unit. Trimer 1 showed very small fluorescence quantum yields (Φf = 0.02 in dioxane and 0.007 in trifluorotoluene), which were determined by using zinc phthalocyanate in 1-chloronaphthalene as reference (Φf = 0.30),12 in comparison with SubPc monomers. This result suggests electronic communication between each SubPc moiety of trimer 1. It is inferred that energy transfer occurs from the H-SubPc unit to the F- or TFEO-SubPc unit. Energy transmission was also suggested by the steady-state fluorescence spectra. Although both peaks are quenched, the values of quenching around 570 nm originating from the H-SubPc unit are more significant than the other peak, which implies energy/electron transfer from the H-SubPc unit to the F- or TFEO-SubPc moiety.

Cyclic voltammograms (CV) of trimer 1 and SubPc monomers 2a–c in THF are summarized in Fig. 4 and Table 1. Trimer 1 exhibited three reduction peaks at −1.06, −1.30 and −1.67 V that are attributed to an independent reduction process of each SubPc unit in the cathodic scan. In the anodic scan of trimer 1, two oxidation processes were observed at 0.640 and 0.985 V. The first reduction process of the SubPc monomer was observed at −1.49 V in H-SubPc 2c and easier reduction processes occurred in TFEO-SubPc 2a and F-SubPc 2b at −1.10 and −0.962 V, respectively. On the other hand, fluorine-containing SubPc 2a,b showed a more difficult oxidation process than H-SubPc 2c (2a: 0.727, 2b: 1.00, and 2c: 0.590 V). These results indicate that the molecular orbital energy of SubPc was stabilized by introducing a strong electron-withdrawing fluorine atom.

To discuss the electron transfer process between each of the three SubPc units, we carried out DFT calculations using the Gaussian09 program,13 which gave the distribution of the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of 1 and 2a–c. The molecular geometries of 1 and 2a–c were optimized at the B97D/6-31G* level. The partial molecular orbital energy diagrams calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G* level using the optimized geometries are shown in Fig. 5. Further details of the calculations are shown in the ESI.† The relationship of HOMO energy levels of SubPc and that of LUMO energy levels are as follows: H-SubPc 2c > TFEO-SubPc 2a > F-SubPc 2b. This result agrees with the trend of the CV measurement and suggests that intramolecular energy transfer in trimer 1 should occur in three patterns: H-SubPc to F-SubPc, H-SubPc to TFEO-SubPc and TFEO-SubPc to F-SubPc (Fig. 1). Even though the LUMO is degenerated by two orbitals in monomer SubPc 2, non-degenerate orbitals are configured in trimer 1 due to a reduction of molecular symmetry. The energy levels of LUMO+2 and LUMO+3 of 1 are close to the LUMO of 2a. Furthermore, the distribution of LUMO+2 and LUMO+3 of 1 is localized in the TFEO-SubPc unit (Fig. 6). These results indicate that the LUMO+2 and LUMO+3 of 1 originate from the LUMO of 2a. On the other hand, the LUMO to LUMO+1 of 1 are attributed to the LUMO of 2b according to an orbital energy level and distribution map. The HOMO of different SubPc monomers configures three occupied molecular orbitals in 1. The HOMO, HOMO−1 and HOMO−2 of 1 originate from the HOMO of 2c, 2a and 2b, respectively. As a result, the HOMO of 1 distributes mainly on the H-SubPc unit while the LUMO on the TFEO-SubPc unit.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized novel SubPc trimer 1 made up of TFEO-SubPc, F-SubPc and H-SubPc bridged at the axial position via a phloroglucinol linker and investigated its optical properties by UV-Vis and fluorescence spectra. The UV-Vis spectra of 1 show a shape composed of the absorption of TFEO-SubPc 2a, F-SubPc 2b and H-SubPc 2c. This result indicates that each subphthalocyanine unit of 1 is electronically independent. On the other hand, the steady-state fluorescence spectra of 1 show quenched peaks which suggest energy transfer from H-SubPc to F-SubPc via TFEO-SubPc units, and/or directly H-SubPc to F-SubPc units. DFT calculations strongly support this phenomenon. These results would attract chemists as tools for development of novel electron/energy transfer systems7,8,14 as well as photocatalysis for organic reactions.15
