    , Accepted 8th March 2017First published on 9th March 2017AbstractRecent developments on regio-regular and random terpolymers based on a donor/acceptor architecture (D1–A–D2–A or D–A1–D–A2) have shown promising results for their use as donor materials in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells. New random terpolymers including benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene (BDT) as the electron-donor moiety and thiadiazolo[3,4-e]isoindole-5,7-dione (TID) and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) as electron-accepting moieties were synthesized by Stille cross-coupling polymerization. Incremental addition of TPD (from 0 to 90%) led to the following random terpolymers: P[(BDT-TID)x-(BDT-TPD)y]n. Their electro-optical and photovoltaic properties were investigated. These high molecular weight and highly processable random terpolymers exhibited broad and strong absorption (300–800 nm), moderate bandgaps (1.52 eV to 1.64 eV) and deep-lying HOMO/LUMO energy levels (−5.6 eV and −3.9 eV, respectively). First, the optimized inverted device ITO/ZnO/P1:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag (where P1 is a typical D/A copolymer; TID 100%; TPD 0%) showed a power conversion efficiency up to 6.36% which is higher than the PCE reported in the literature for an analog of P1 (3.42%). Then, devices based on random terpolymers (P2–P10) showed power conversion efficiencies ranging from 5.06% (for P7; 40% TID/60% TPD) up to 6.70% (for P2; 90% TID/10% TPD) when PC61PM is used as the electron acceptor. A PCE as high as 7.30%, a Voc of 0.81 V, a Jsc of 13.86 mA cm−2 and a FF of 65% were achieved for P2 when PC71PM was used. This PCE is among the highest PCE values reported for random terpolymer-based polymer solar cells.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted great interest in the past few years due to the possibility to fabricate efficient, light and flexible large-area devices using low cost and environmentally friendly processing techniques such as roll-to-roll printing.1–5 Over the last decade, the performance of polymer solar cell devices has steadily increased, mainly due to the development of new and well-defined electron-donor/electron-acceptor (D–A) copolymers with broad absorption, low band gaps, deep-lying HOMO–LUMO energy levels and adequate charge transport properties.1,2 Enhancements in the processing of the bulk heterojunction and control over the nanomorphology of the blend combined with a better understanding of the interface engineering also contribute to the remarkable improvements of polymer solar cell efficiencies. Until now, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 10% have been achieved for single and multi-junction polymer solar cells.6–10
The development of D–A copolymers is recognized as a convenient strategy for the synthesis of low band gap polymers because it allows efficient tuning of the absorption bands and also provides control over electro-optical properties such as HOMO–LUMO energy levels and charge mobility. Over the last few years, numerous D–A copolymers have been developed. Benzodithiophene-based (BDT) copolymers are among the most efficient materials studied for polymer solar cells. When combined with strong electron-acceptor units such as thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT) or thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) derivatives, highly efficient polymer solar cells with a high Voc and high PCE have been reported.11–15 On the short list of strong electron-accepting units for D–A copolymers are [1,2,5]thiadiazole[3,4-e]isoindole-5,7-dione derivatives (also reported as pyrrolo[3,4-f]-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-5,7-dione or 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-5,6-carboxylic imide (BTI)).16–20 As for TPD, the imide provides a site for alkyl substitution through the nitrogen atom which allows the synthesis of highly soluble and high molecular weight copolymers. A power conversion efficiency up to 2.10% with Voc = 0.80 V was reported for PDI-BDTO (Fig. 1), a high molecular weight polymer () with a moderate band gap (1.54 eV) and a deep-lying HOMO energy level (−5.44 eV).16 Upon slight modification of the side chains on BDT and TID units, the resulting low molecular weight, ( = 11 kg mol−1) larger band gap (1.68 eV) TID-based copolymer (P(BTI-B)) (Fig. 1) shows better photovoltaic performances with a PCE up to 3.42%.18 The band gaps of known BDT–TID based copolymers (1.5–1.6 eV) are much lower than the band gap of one of the most efficient TPD-based copolymers (namely PBDTTPD with Eg = 1.80 eV), which means that TID is a stronger electron-accepting unit than TPD.

Recently, the development of regio-regular21–27 and random terpolymers28–39 as an innovative strategy to tune the electro-optical properties of conventional two component D–A copolymers showed promising results in polymer solar cells. In most cases, regio-regular and random terpolymers comprise three components using the following structures: (1) D1–A–D2–A where two different electron-donor units are combined with one electron-accepting unit; (2) D–A1–D–A2 where one electron-donor unit is combined with two different electron-accepting units. The idea behind this strategy is that the incorporation of a third component embedded into the main polymer backbone would allow the efficient tuning of the electro-optical properties of conjugated polymers. Moreover, this strategy has been used to reduce the synthetic cost of one of the most efficient materials studied in polymer solar cells.34 For instance, Jiang et al. synthesized a new random terpolymer (D–A1–D–A2) by replacing up to 25% of the expensive 3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate by 2,2′-bithiophene, a cheap compound. Optimization of devices led to a PCE of 8.19% for PTB7-Th-T2 (a random terpolymer with 25% of bithiophene) compared to 7.89% for PTB7-Th.34 Recently, random terpolymers led to the development of the so-called “solar trees”, the first large scale demonstration of fully coated flexible organic photovoltaic modules.40
Inspired by the work done on efficient random terpolymers based on benzodithiophene (BDT), [1,2,5]thiadiazole[3,4-e]isoindole-5,7-dione (TID) and benzothiadiazole (BT) using the D–A1–D–A2 structure,20 we report here the synthesis of new random terpolymers by replacing the BT unit by TPD, a stronger electron-accepting unit. Incremental addition of TPD (from 0 to 90%) led to the following random terpolymers, P[(BDT-TID)x-(BDT-TPD)y]n, which were synthesized through Stille cross-coupling polymerization. These random terpolymers have broad and strong absorption (300–800 nm), moderate bandgaps (1.52 eV to 1.64 eV) and deep-lying HOMO/LUMO energy levels (−5.6 eV and −3.9 eV, respectively). The most efficient random terpolymer showed a power conversion efficiency up to 7.30% under the illumination of AM1.5G, (100 mW cm−2) which is among the highest PCEs reported so far using random terpolymers as the active component in polymer solar cells.29,30,32,34
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
2,6-Bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-di(2-ethylhexyloxyl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene, 1,3-dibromo-5-octyl-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione and 4,8-bis(5-bromo-thiophen-2-yl)-6-(2-octyldodecyl)-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]isoindole-5,7-dione were prepared according to the literature.12,20
2.2 Methods

1H spectra were recorded on a Varian AS400 MHz apparatus in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-D2 at 90 °C. Number-average () and weight-average () molecular weights were determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using a high temperature Varian Polymer Laboratories GPC220 equipped with an RI detector and a PL BV400 HT Bridge Viscometer. The column set consists of 2 PL gel Mixed C (300 × 7.5 mm) columns and a PL gel Mixed C guard column. The flow rate was fixed at 1mL min−1 using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) (with 0.0125% BHT w/v) as the eluent. The temperature of the system was set to 110 °C. All the samples were prepared at a nominal concentration of 1.0 mg mL−1 in TCB. Dissolution was performed using a Varian Polymer Laboratories PL-SP 260VC sample preparation system. The sample vials were held at 110 °C with shaking for 1 h for complete dissolution. The solutions were filtered through a 2 mm porous stainless steel filter used with a 0.40 μm glass filter into a 2 mL chromatography vial. The calibration method used to generate the reported data was the classical polystyrene method using polystyrene narrow standards Easi-Vials PS-M from Varian Polymer Laboratories which were dissolved in TCB. UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra were recorded using a Varian Cary 500 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer using 1 cm path-length quartz cells. For solid state measurements, the polymer solution (chloroform) was spin-cast on glass plates. Optical bandgaps were calculated from the onset of the absorption band. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded on a Solartron 1287 potentiostat using platinum wires as the working electrode and counter electrode at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The reference electrode was Ag/Ag + (0.01 M AgNO3 in acetonitrile) and the electrolyte was a solution of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate in dry acetonitrile. Under these conditions, the oxidation potential of ferrocene was 0.09 V versus Ag/Ag+, whereas the oxidation potential of ferrocene was 0.41 V versus the saturated calomel electrode (SCE). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were determined from the oxidation and reduction onsets (where the current differs from the baseline) assuming that the SCE is −4.71 eV from vacuum, as reported in the literature.41
2.3 Device fabrication and characterization
Inverted BHJ solar cells were prepared on a commercial ITO-coated glass substrate (24 × 24 mm) with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω square−1 (Thin Film Devices Inc, USA). The thickness of the ITO layer is about 250 nm. Each substrate was patterned using photolithography techniques to produce a segment with an active area of 24 mm2. The substrates were sonicated sequentially in cleanroom detergent, deionized (DI) water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. Immediately prior to device fabrication, the substrates were treated in a plasma–oxygen chamber (Spacemaker II sensor, Plasmatic Systems, Inc, USA) for 5 min. First, a ZnO thin film of about 40 nm was spin-cast on top of the ITO electrode using a syringe fitted with a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) filter. The preparation of the ZnO precursor was performed according to the synthesis described by Heeger and co-workers.42 Thereafter, the ZnO film was cured at 200 °C for 60 min in air. The active layer was deposited over the ZnO layer by spin coating a polymer/PCBM solution using a syringe fitted with a 0.45 μm PTFE filter. All the blend solutions were prepared by dissolving the polymers (typically 10 mg mL−1) and [60]PCBM (typically 20 mg mL−1) or [70]PCBM (nano-c) in ODCB and stirring the mixture on a hotplate at 60–70 °C overnight in air. After the photoactive layer deposition, the substrates were dried at room temperature in air. Layer thicknesses (70–100 nm) were measured using a Veeco Deltak IIA surface profiler. Finally, MoO3 (8 nm) and Ag (100 nm) were sequentially vacuum-deposited through a shadow mask on top of the active layer by thermal evaporation under high vacuum (2 × 10−5 Torr). Current versus potential curves (J–V characteristics) were measured with a Keithley 2400 Digital Source Meter under a collimated beam. Illumination of the cells was done through the ITO side using light from a 150 W Oriel Instruments Solar Simulator and a xenon lamp with an AM1.5G filter to provide an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a KG-5 filtered silicon photodiode. The fabrication and characterization of the solar cells were performed in air without any encapsulation.
2.4 General synthetic procedures for the polymers
Take P2 (structure shown in Scheme 1) as an example. A 10 mL oven-dried microwave vial was charged with 1 equivalent of 2,6-bis(trimethyltin)-4,8-di(2-ethylhexyloxyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, 0.9 eq. of 4,8-bis(5-bromo-thiophen-2-yl)-6-(2-octyldodecyl)-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]isoindole-5,7-dione and 0.1 eq. of 1,3-dibromo-5-octyl-thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione, Pd2(dba)3 (3 mol%) and P(o-tolyl)3 (12 mol%). The vial was sealed and purged through vacuum/nitrogen filling (3 times). Then, anhydrous and oxygen-free chlorobenzene ([ ] = 0.1 M) was added and the reaction mixture was vigorously stirred in an oil bath from room temperature to 115 °C and reacted until gelation (1 h for P1–P4; 24 h for P5–P10). The reaction mixture was cooled to 65 °C, and then 5 mL of o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred for an additional 20 min. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and the polymer was precipitated in methanol, filtered through a 0.45 μm nylon filter and washed by Soxhlet extraction using acetone, hexanes and then chloroform. The chloroform fraction was reduced to 5 mL and then slowly poured into methanol. The precipitate was filtered through a 0.45 μm nylon filter and the polymer was then dried under reduced pressure (24 h). The polymers were soluble in hot chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene and trichlorobenzene.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization of the polymers
As shown in Scheme 1, all the polymers were synthesized using the well-established Migita–Stille cross-coupling polymerization. Typical synthetic procedures using tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2dba3), P(o-tolyl)3 and various amounts of comonomers in chlorobenzene at 115 °C led to polymers P1 to P10 (Table 1). As reported in the literature, molecular weights, electro-optical properties and device performances based on analogs of P1 are very sensitive to the type and the size of the chains installed on each comonomer (Fig. 1).16–20 Wang et al. reported the first BDT–TID copolymer (namely PDI-BDTO).16 By using branched side-chains (2-butyloctyl) on BDT and a branched side-chain (2-ethylhexyl) on TID, they obtained PDI-BDTO with a number-average molecular weight of 44 kg mol−1 (in CHCl3) with a molar dispersity of 2.0. With a maximum absorption of 632 nm in solution in CHCl3 and an optical bandgap of 1.54 eV (solid state), devices using a conventional configuration and PDI-BDTO:PC71BM blend exhibit moderate performances (Jsc = 5.53 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.80 V, FF = 47.1% and PCE = 2.10%). Li et al. reported P(BTI-B) (an analog of P1, Fig. 1) with a straight alkyl chain (C8H17) on BDT and a long and linear side-chain (C12H25) on TID ( = 11454 g mol−1; Đ = 1.57; in THF).18 For P(BTI-B), a lower λmax (610 nm in CHCl3) was reported which can be related to the lower molecular weight of P(BTI-B). Devices using a conventional architecture and P(BTI-B):PC61BM blend show better performances with Jsc = 9.8 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.75 V, FF = 47% and PCE = 3.42%. Finally, Yao et al. reported PDIC20-BDT another analog of P1 with branched side-chains (2-ethylhexyl) on BDT and a branched side-chain (2-octyldodecyl) on TID ( = 28.3 kg mol−1; Đ = 2.16; in TCB @ 140 °C).19 This polymer has a λmax of 643 nm (in chlorobenzene) and an optical band gap of 1.51 eV. By using the same side chain on BDT and TID as those previously used by Yao et al., we obtained P1 with higher molecular weights ( = 150 kg mol−1; Đ = 2.0; in TCB @ 110 °C). As shown in Table 2, a higher λmax (662 nm) was obtained for P1 owing to the higher molecular weight obtained compared to other P1 analogs. The feeding ratio of the TPD unit was then carefully modified to mimic the promising materials reported by Blouin et al. and to identify the feeding ratio that led to the best photovoltaic performances.20 As shown in Table 1, while the polymerization yield remains constant (for the soluble fraction in chloroform), a drop in the number-average molecular weight is observed upon increasing the feeding ratio of the TPD moiety. Indeed, with a feeding ratio up to 90% (P10), the molecular weights obtained are in the same range as those reported for PBDTTPD. Unfortunately, 1H NMR spectroscopy was useless in determining if the polymers were successfully obtained with the exact chemical structure. Indeed, except for a low molecular weight batch of P1 ( = 30 kg mol−1), broad and featureless NMR spectra were obtained due to limited solubility of the polymers in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-D2 (C2D2Cl4) at 90 °C (see ESI†). Moreover, unlike other D–A1–D–A2 random terpolymers reported in the literature,37,39 and due to the similar chemical structures of TID and TPD moieties, no typical chemical shift coming from either TID or TPD (each polymer showing resonance at 4.31 ppm and 3.75 ppm coming from O–CH2–R (BDT) and N–CH2–R (TID and TPD) can be identified, which prevents reliable quantification of the composition of the final molecular structures.

3.2 Electro-optical properties of the polymers
The absorption spectra of the polymers in dilute o-dichlorobenzene solution and in the solid state are shown in Fig. 2 and 3. Their absorption maxima and optical band gaps are summarized in Table 2. Each polymer (except for P7) in thin film shows a bathochromic shift of the absorption bands which indicates a strong intermolecular stacking in the solid state. Moreover, for P1, we obtained a λmax of 670 nm in the solid state compared to 661 nm reported by Yao et al. for a lower molecular weight P1 analog. Each absorption spectrum is broad and covers most of the visible domain which should contribute to an efficient absorption of light and to generate high current in solar cells. As shown in Table 2, the absorption spectrum and the band gap of the terpolymers are modulated upon increasing the ratio of the TPD comonomer from P1 (TPD = 0%; Eg = 1.52 eV) to P10 (TPD = 90%; Eg = 1.64 eV). When compared to PBDTTPD (TPD = 100%; Eg = 1.80 eV),12P10 has a broader absorption spectrum and lower band gap which means that enhanced collection of light should be envisioned. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were used for the estimation of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and the electrochemical data are reported in Table 2. One can see that all the polymers have deep-lying HOMO energy levels which are not affected by the ratio of TPD. Compared to PBDTTPD (HOMO = −5.56 eV; LUMO = −3.75 eV),12 the experimental data show that the LUMO is driven by the TID moiety regardless of the TPD content. The reduced band gap of P1 to P10 compared to PBDTTPD is mainly due to the stabilization of the LUMO energy level by 0.15 eV. All the polymers have a LUMO energy level within the range for efficient electron transfer to PC61BM or PC71BM. Moreover, the deep HOMO energy level obtained should lead to solar cells with a high Voc.18

3.3 Solar cell performance
All the devices were fabricated and tested in air using the following inverted configuration: Indium tin oxide (ITO)/zinc oxide (ZnO)/polymer:[6,6]-phenyl-C61 or C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/molybdenum trioxide (MoO3)/Ag (Fig. 4). The active layer was obtained by spin-coating from an ODCB solution with or without additives. The active area of each cell was 0.24 cm2 and the current density–voltage (J–V) measurement was carried out under simulated AM1.5 solar illumination calibrated at 100 mW cm−2. The inverted configuration shows enhanced stability over the classical configuration and, more importantly, it is compatible with high throughput and low-cost manufacturing processes.43–46
 Fig. 4  Inverted solar cell architecture. 
As discussed earlier, Wang et al. have reported solar cells using a conventional configuration (active area of 0.06 cm2) using PDI-BDTO, a low molecular weight analog of P1 (Fig. 1).16 Optimized devices based on the PDI-BDTO:PC71BM blend (ratio 1:2; with DIO as the additive) exhibited a PCE of 2.10% with a Jsc of 5.53 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.80 V and a FF of 47.1%. On the other hand, Li et al. have reported a more efficient solar cell using a conventional configuration (active area 0.07 cm2) for P(BTI-B), another lower molecular weight analog of P1 (Fig. 1).18 Optimized devices based on the P(BTI-B):PC61BM blend (ratio 1:1; without additives) exhibit a PCE of 3.42% with a Jsc of 9.71 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.75 V and a FF of 47%. Wang and Li have shown that device performances based on BDT and TID can vary depending on the side chains used.16,18 Li et al. also showed that the hole mobility (6.8 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1) measured by SCLC is low which might lead to unbalanced charge transport within the bulk heterojunction.18 In this work, we highlighted the fact that the molecular weight of copolymers based on BDT and TID is an important parameter that drives the PCE. Indeed, preliminary results of solar cells based on P1:PC61BM (ratio 1:3, see Table 1 in the ESI†) are a PCE of 5.82%, with a Jsc of 11.21 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.81 V and a FF of 64%. Upon optimization of the processing parameters of the active layer (polymer/PCBM blend ratio, thickness and the use of additives) the overall solar cell performances of P1 were enhanced (Fig. 5). The results are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. The P1:PC61BM (1% of DPE) device shows PCE = 6.04%, Jsc = 11.50 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.79 V and FF = 66% while the P1:PC71BM device shows PCE = 6.36%, Jsc = 12.61 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.78 V and FF = 65% (Table 4). These results surpassed those reported in the literature.16,18

The nano-morphology of the blended P1:PC61BM was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 6) since the morphology of the blend has a strong impact on the photovoltaic output. From the AFM image shown in Fig. 6, we observed that the P1:PC61BM has a smooth film surface (root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.4 nm) and continuous phase separation domains. A smooth surface and well-distributed domain size are required to achieve highly efficient polymer solar cells. It is worth noting that the root-mean-square roughness of P1 (1.4 nm) is higher than that of P(BTI-B) (0.84 nm).24 The slightly rougher film does not impact the series resistance since the solar cell obtained using P1 performed much better than that obtained using P(BTI-B). Moreover, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of P1:PC61BM confirms the presence of good interpenetrating networks required for efficient charge generation and extraction.

We then studied the regio-random terpolymers P3 to P10 using the same device architecture and processing optimization and the results are summarized in Table 3 (see the ESI† for optimization data). Increasing the TPD content from 10% (P2) to 90% (P10) led to a higher Voc despite the fact that the HOMO energy level of P2–P10 remains constant for the entire series. The most efficient random terpolymer is P2 with a PCE up to 6.70%, Jsc = 12.87 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.79 V and FF = 66%. Upon further optimization (Fig. 7 and Table 4), a PCE of 7.30% was obtained for the P2:PC71BM blend which is among the highest PCE values reported for regio-random terpolymers. Indeed, to the best of our knowledge, the highest power conversion efficiency reported so far for terpolymers, regardless of the regioregularity, is 8.4% reported by Duan et al.32 As shown in Fig. 6, the morphology of P2:PC61BM blend has a smooth surface with a RMS roughness of 0.8 nm. As for P1 and P2, the effect of DPE as the additive on the Jsc and PCE is significant (see Fig. 1, ESI†). An increase of the Jsc values up to 70% has been obtained in some cases. The decrease of the Jsc upon the increase of the TPD content is in good agreement with the optical properties of P2 to P10. As the TPD ratio is increased, the band gap is tuned from 1.52 eV to 1.64 eV and a hypsochromic shift of the absorption spectrum is observed which means that less light is absorbed by the active layer. The lowering of the Jsc could also be explained in part by the nanomorphology of the bulk heterojunction (see Fig. 2, ESI†). Indeed, the AFM topography images of the P3 to P10:PC61BM blends processed from ODCB (with DPE as the additive) are modulated upon the increase of the TPD ratio. The AFM images show a rougher surface of P4 to P10 compared to P2 and larger nano-domains (over 100 nm) going from P3 to P10 (increasing TPD content) which affect the charge separation efficiency and limit the transport and dissociation of the charge at the polymer/PCBM interface, thus lowering the Jsc. As for P1 and P2, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images confirm the presence of good interpenetrating networks, which are required for efficient charge generation and extraction (see Fig. 3, ESI†). Despite their rougher surfaces and larger nanoscale domains (Fig. 2, ESI†), the photovoltaic performances of P3 to P10 are still good with the FF averaging 65%, high Voc and PCE exceeding 6% for most of them.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we have reported the synthesis of new random terpolymers through a Stille cross-coupling reaction between benzodithiophene (BDT), thiadiazole[3,4-e]isoindole-5,7-dione (TID) and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD). Upon systematic variation of the TPD ratio within the D–A1–D–A2 structure, modulation of the bandgap from 1.52 eV to 1.64 eV was observed going from P1 (0% of TPD) to P10 (90% of TPD). The random terpolymers showed strong absorption within the visible domain and deep HOMO energy levels enabling a high Voc in solar cells. A power conversion efficiency up to 6.36% was obtained for P1, a copolymer with a high molecular weight whose solar cell performances surpass those reported for P(BTI-B), PDI-BDTO and PDIC20-BDT, three copolymers based on BDT and TID already reported in the literature. More importantly, highly efficient P2 led to a Jsc of 13.86 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.81 V, FF = 65% and a PCE up to 7.30%. This PCE is among the best results reported for random terpolymers.29,30,32,34 In light of the results reported here, along with the latest reports on regio-random terpolymers (e.g. solar trees), it appears that this new synthetic strategy is a reliable alternative to prepare efficient materials for cheap polymer solar cells when compared to the classical regio-regular donor/acceptor copolymers.
