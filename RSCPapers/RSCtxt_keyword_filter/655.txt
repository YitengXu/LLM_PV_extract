    , Accepted 14th January 2020First published on 14th January 2020AbstractNowadays, organic solar cells (OSCs) with Y6 and its derivatives as electron acceptors provide the highest efficiencies among the studied binary OSCs. To further improve the performances of OSCs, the fabrication of ternary OSCs (TOSCs) is a convenient strategy. Essentially, morphology control and the trade-off between voltage and photocurrent are the main critical issues in TOSCs. Herein, we address these problems by constructing TOSCs where an alloy-like composite is formed between Y6 and a newly designed derivative, BTP-M. Employing an electron-pushing methyl substituent as a replacement for the electron-withdrawing F atoms on Y6, BTP-M shows higher energy levels and lower crystallinity than Y6. As a result, the obtained Y6:BTP-M alloy can simultaneously optimize energy levels to reduce energy loss as well as the morphologies of the active layers to favor photocurrent generation, leading to an enhanced open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.875 V together with a larger short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 26.56 mA cm−2 for TOSCs based on the polymer donor PM6 and Y6:BTP-M acceptor alloy. Consequently, a best efficiency of 17.03% is achieved for the corresponding TOSCs, which is among the best values for single-junction OSCs. In addition, our TOSCs also exhibit good thickness tolerance, and can reach 14.23% efficiency even though the active layer is as thick as 300 nm.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs), with their light weight, low-cost and mechanical flexibility properties, provide a green approach for light energy harvesting. For practical applications, the efficiency remains the first critical issue to solve. Non-fullerene acceptors have recently boosted the efficiencies of OSCs to over 16%. One typical binary system is PM6:Y6. Herein, we designed a new non-fullerene acceptor named BTP-M, which was added into a PM6:Y6 blend as the third component to further improve the efficiency of PM6:Y6-based OSCs. It was found that an alloy-like model based on Y6 and BTP-M was formed, which helps lower the energy loss and boost the quantum efficiency, thus addressing the trade-off between voltage and photocurrent well. As a result, a best efficiency of 17.03% was achieved for single-junction OSCs with a thin film of 120 nm and over 14% efficiency was maintained for devices with a thick film of 300 nm.

Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have undergone rapid progress since the emergence of non-fullerene acceptors with tunable absorption and energy levels,1–5 such as fused-ring ITIC by Zhan's group,6 IT-4F by Hou's group,7 COi8DFIC by Ding's group,8 O-IDTBR by McCulloch's group,9 and unfused-core DF-PCIC and non-fused PTIC by Chen's group,10–12etc. Very recently, a new non-fullerene acceptor, abbreviated as Y6, with the features of a high electron mobility and a broad absorption range up to 930 nm, was reported by Zou's group. When paired with polymer donor PM6, the PM6:Y6 based OSCs achieved breakthrough in power conversion efficiency (PCE = 15.7%).13–16 So far, the devices with Y6 or its derivatives as electron acceptors provide the highest PCEs among all binary OSCs.17–20 To further improve the PCEs to a new level, constructing ternary OSCs (TOSCs) is a convenient strategy by utilizing the advantages of three components, either two donors and one acceptor, or one donor and two acceptors.21–31 For example, the fullerene derivative PC71BM was added into the binary blend of PM6:Y6 as the third component, which helps lower the energy loss via elevating the energy levels and increase photocurrent by enhancing the absorption in a short wavelength band, thus boosting the PCEs of PM6:Y6:PC71BM-based TOSCs to 16–16.7%.32–34 However, due to the poor absorption and energetic tunability of fullerene derivatives, the improvement in PCE of the corresponding TOSCs is limited. In contrast, non-fullerene acceptors with diversified molecular structures could serve as the more suitable third component to further optimize the absorptions and energy levels of blends.35–37 Moreover, the two non-fullerene acceptors with a similar structure would have good compatibility, beneficial for the formation of an alloy-like composite, which works like one material, but the properties of the composite, including energy levels and crystallinity, can be continuously adjusted via a change of ratios.21 Therefore, among various ternary models, an alloy-like model could show specific benefits in morphology optimization, thus increasing the probabilities of successfully constructing TOSCs.38–41 However, reports of highly efficient TOSCs with non-fullerene acceptor alloy-like composites are still rare, especially for Y6-based systems.42–45
Morphology control and the trade-off between voltage and photocurrent are the main critical issues in TOSCs.46–48 Herein, we design a ternary blend working in an alloy-like model to address these problems, aiming to achieve a higher PCE for OSCs based on PM6:Y6. For the PM6:Y6 binary system, there is still space for narrowing the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level offset (0.36 eV) between PM6 and Y6 to further mitigate energy loss as well as for reducing the strong aggregation tendency of Y6 to optimize phase-separation domain sizes.49–52 To achieve the above purposes, we synthesize a new non-fullerene acceptor as the third component for the PM6:Y6 binary system with the following considerations: (1) to form acceptor alloy with good miscibility to Y6, the same molecular backbone as Y6 is applied,53 (2) to elevate the LUMO level of acceptor alloy, weak electron-donating methyl groups are introduced at the terminals of the designed molecule instead of electron-withdrawing F atoms in Y6,54 (3) mono-methyl substituted terminal is chosen to reduce the intermolecular interactions and the existence of isomers leads to tune the aggregation behaviors of acceptors effectively.55 Thus, a Y6 analogue, BTP-M, is designed and synthesized. The chemical structures of PM6, Y6 and BTP-M are displayed in Fig. 1a.

Through characterizations, the formation of Y6:BTP-M alloy-like composite (For clarity, this composite is abbreviated as Y6:BTP-M alloy thereinafter) is confirmed with median energy levels and crystallinity between Y6 and BTP-M. After optimization, TOSCs based on PM6:Y6:BTP-M blend deliver a best PCE of 17.03% with a reduced energy loss (Eloss) of 0.45 eV and enhanced external quantum efficiencies over 86% at around 630 nm, much better than the binary devices based on PM6:Y6 blend (PCE: 15.61%, Eloss: 0.49 eV). Interestingly, we find that the TOSCs can keep PCEs over 14% when the thickness of the active layers is varied from 120 to 300 nm. Such thickness insensitivity favors device fabrication by industrial technology like roll-to-roll printing.56 These results suggest that the non-fullerene acceptor alloy Y6:BTP-M can effectively optimize the morphology of the ternary blend and solve the trade-off between voltage and photocurrent for TOSCs, and thus result in a champion PCE for single heterojunction OSCs.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic details and characterizations of BTP-M can be found in the ESI.† The absorption of BTP-M solution and thin film is displayed in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Fig. 1b shows the absorption of the PM6, Y6 and BTP-M films. The absorption of the BTP-M film mainly lies in the range of 550–870 nm. From the onset of the absorption edge (875 nm), the calculated optical bandgap of BTP-M is 1.42 eV. Compared with Y6, BTP-M exhibits a blue-shift by around 50 nm at the maximum absorption peak due to the reduced intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect.
To verify whether BTP-M and Y6 can form an alloy-like composite, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were firstly used to check the changes in melting and crystallization behaviors and the results are presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†). For BTP-M, no melting and crystallization points are observed, suggesting a low crystallinity. For Y6, two melting points appear at 200 °C (ΔH = 2.28 J g−1) and 222 °C (ΔH = 7.14 J g−1) in the heating process, while one crystallization point appears at 197 °C (ΔH = 5.44 J g−1) in the cooling process. After mixing Y6 with BTP-M with the weight ratio of 4:1, the two melting points of the Y6:BTP-M mixture moved to 194 °C (ΔH = 1.59 J g−1) and 215 °C (ΔH = 1.24 J g−1), corresponding to a 6–7 °C variation, while the crystallization point of Y6:BTP-M mixture moved to 182 °C (ΔH = 1.84 J g−1), corresponding to a 15 °C variation. The obvious changes (moving to lower temperature ranges) in the melting and crystallization points indicate a good miscibility of BTP-M and Y6, and the formation of an acceptor alloy.43 Besides, the decreased enthalpy changes reveal that the crystallinity of the Y6:BTP-M alloy lies in the middle of those of Y6 and BTP-M.
A cyclic voltammetry (CV) method was used to measure the energy levels (Fig. S3, ESI†). The energy levels of all the samples were measured in thin films under the same conditions. The energy level diagram of PM6, Y6, BTP-M and Y6:BTP-M (4:1, by wt) is displayed in Fig. 1c. BTP-M has a higher LUMO level (−3.81 eV) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level (−5.48 eV) than those of Y6 (−4.00 eV and −5.65 eV), even those of PC71BM (−3.90 eV and −5.92 eV),33 implying a better energetic tunability of BTP-M. If an alloy-like composite is formed, the electronic properties of the Y6:BTP-M mixture will change with the addition of BTP-M, thus showing elevated energy levels compared with those of Y6.57 As expected, the Y6:BTP-M alloy has median LUMO and HOMO levels of −3.96 eV and −5.61 eV, between those of Y6 and BTP-M, but the electrochemical bandgap of the Y6:BTP-M alloy remains the same as that of Y6. Since Y6 is dominant in the Y6:BTP-M mixture, the energy levels of the Y6:BTP-M alloy are higher but still close to those of Y6. Therefore, TOSCs based on a PM6 donor and Y6:BTP-M acceptor alloy can show an improved open-circuit voltage (Voc) compared with that based on the PM6:Y6 binary blend, while the blend absorption edge will not be influenced to obtain a high short-circuit current density (Jsc) (Fig. S4, ESI†).58
Photovoltaic properties
Since Y6 and BTP-M can form an alloy-like composite with elevated energy levels and tuned crystallinity, it is thus attractive to see the effects of the alloy on the device performance of TOSCs. During the optimization of the photovoltaic performances, we tried different types of devices, including conventional devices, inverted devices, additive-free devices or non-chlorinated solvent processed devices. It was found that conventional devices processed from a chloroform solvent are the optimal choice. The performances of other types of devices can be found in the ESI,† (Fig. S5–S7 and Table S1). Therefore, we fabricated both the binary and ternary devices with the conventional structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/Active Layer/PFN-Br/Ag. All binary and ternary OSCs based on the PM6 donor were fabricated with the optimal conditions of a donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratio of 1:1.2, the addition of 0.5% (v/v) 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) and thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. Keeping the total D/A weight ratio as 1:1.2, various ratios of BTP-M (15%, 20%, 25%, by wt.) were added to the acceptor mixture to construct the ternary blends. The control of the active layer thickness is realized by the change of total concentration in the chloroform solution. More information can be found in the ESI.†J–V curves of the binary and ternary devices are displayed in Fig. 2a and the relevant photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1 (the device statistics are presented in Table S2, ESI†). The binary device based on the PM6:Y6 blend exhibits a PCE of 15.61%, consistent with the reported results.13 With the addition of BTP-M, an obvious increase in Voc was observed from 0.844 V for the 0% device, to 0.861 V for the 15% device, 0.875 V for the 20% device and 0.879 V for the 25% device, which is in agreement with the higher-lying LUMO level of the Y6:BTP-M alloy. Since the optical bandgap (1.33 eV) of the blends nearly remains the same with the addition of BTP-M (Fig. S4, ESI†), the calculated energy loss (Eloss = Eg − eVoc) thus reduces gradually from 0.49 eV for the 0% device, to 0.47 eV for the 15% device, 0.45 eV for the 20% device, and 0.45 for the 25% device. The reduced energy loss value for the 20% device is in accord with the elevated LUMO level value (0.04 eV) of the Y6:BTP-M acceptor alloy. Another obvious enhancement is presented in the Jsc. The 0% device shows a Jsc of 24.67 mA cm−2, while the Jsc values of the ternary devices (15–20%) increase to over 26.5 mA cm−2. The increase in Jsc may originate from the optimized morphology, which will be analyzed below. As for the FF, ternary devices keep similar values to that (74.96%) of the 0% device, indicating that the Y6:BTP-M acceptor alloy has a good charge transport property close to that of Y6. As a result, the optimal TOSC with the addition of 20% BTP-M shows the best PCE of 17.03%, which is one of the highest efficiencies reported to date for single-junction OSCs. Fig. 2b demonstrates the efficiency histograms of the Y6-based binary and ternary blends. It is also worth pointing out that our TOSCs provide both a higher Voc and Jsc than those based on PM6:Y6:PC71BM blends,32,33 proving the advantages of the alloy composed of two well-designed non-fullerene acceptors.

For the PM6:BTP-M binary device, due to the low Jsc and FF, a low PCE of 4.26% is obtained, though the Voc is as high as 0.975 V. One possible reason leading to the low PCE of PM6:BTP-M-based binary device is the nearly flat HOMO levels for PM6 and BTP-M, and thereby the photoinduced hole transfer from BTP-M to PM6 is insufficient, which is proved by the fact that the photoluminescence (PL) of BTP-M in the PM6:BTP-M blend can's be quenched completely (Fig. S8, ESI†). As a contrast, an efficient hole transfer can happen between Y6 and PM6. To further verify this, we also fabricated PBDB-T:BTP-M binary OSCs where PBDB-T is the non-fluorinated analogue of PM6 with a higher HOMO level of −5.33 eV.59 As expected, a high PCE of 14.24% was obtained, certifying that BTP-M can also work efficiently as an acceptor if a suitable donor is chosen (Fig. S9, ESI†).
External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the relevant OSCs are presented in Fig. 2c. For the 0% binary device, the EQE response is around 80% with the highest value of 81.66% at 630 nm. In comparison, all the ternary devices exhibited an enhanced EQE response in the whole wavelength range of 300–900 nm (see Fig. 2d). For a 20% device, the highest value of the EQE response reached 86.82% at 640 nm, which is among the best results for OSCs with about 100 nm thick active layers. These results illustrate that absorptions from both donor and acceptor are more efficiently converted to photocurrent in the ternary blends, implying that the main reason for the photocurrent improvement is the morphology optimization of the active layers.60 The variation in EQE spectra conforms to the observed Jsc values in the J–V curves.
The light stability of binary and ternary (20%) devices under 1 sun light was also measured and is presented in Fig. S10 (ESI†). Both binary and ternary devices experienced a fast decay period in the first 50 h, followed by a linear decay period after that. After 300 h of light soaking, over 50% of the initial efficiencies remained for both binary and ternary devices.
Charge separation, transport and recombination
As demonstrated above, TOSCs with various ratios (15–25%) of BTP-M balance the voltage-photocurrent trade-off well, so it's reasonable to study the charge dynamics in the blends, including charge separation, transport and recombination. Firstly, to examine the effect of acceptor composition on the exciton lifetime, we measured the time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of Y6, BTP-M and Y6:BTP-M films and the results are demonstrated in Fig. 3a. We used a bi-exponential formula of y = A + B1 × exp(−i/τ1) + B2 × exp(−i/τ2) to fit the TRPL results and then the average lifetime was calculated through the formula of . It was found that excitons from Y6 have an average lifetime of 1.80 ns (τ1 = 0.92 ns, B1 = 0.79, τ2 = 5.08 ns, B2 = 0.21), while excitons from BTP-M have a shorter average lifetime of 1.57 ns (τ1 = 1.38 ns, B1 = 0.94, τ2 = 4.36 ns, B2 = 0.06). After blending Y6 with BTP-M (4:1, by wt.), the average lifetime of the excitons in the blend extended to 2.39 ns (τ1 = 1.23 ns, B1 = 0.73, τ2 = 5.53 ns, B2 = 0.27), corresponding to a 33% improvement in the exciton lifetime. The extending of exciton lifetime further proves the formation of the Y6:BTP-M alloy, leading to a longer exciton diffusion length, thus beneficial for obtaining the higher EQE values. Secondly, to examine the charge separation situations, steady-state PL spectra were taken and the results are displayed in Fig. 3b. We can see that the PM6:Y6 binary blend shows an efficient and complete quenching, while the PM6:BTP-M binary blend doesn’t quench well in the range 780–880 nm from the BTP-M emission. Considering that the excitation light (550 nm) locates in the absorption range of PM6, the appeared PL peak of BTP-M means that an energy transfer process occurs from PM6 to BTP-M, which competes with the photoinduced electron transfer from PM6 to BTP-M. Therefore, the exciton dissociation efficiency is low, which is responsible for the bad PCE of the PM6:BTP-M binary device. Moreover, the existence of energy transfer also suggests short distances between the PM6 and BTP-M molecules, which may result in an insufficient phase-separation in the blend, as shown in the morphology characterization below. Fortunately, the ternary blends can almost quench as completely as the PM6:Y6 binary blend, indicating that they have good morphologies, and the elevated energy levels of the Y6:BTP-M alloy don’t affect the charge separation much. To maintaining of efficient charge separation for TOSCs is one of the prerequisites for achieving high photocurrents, as shown above. Although ternary blends show a slightly poorer PL quenching effect compared with the PM6:Y6 binary blend, the benefits in extended exciton lifetime from the TRPL measurement and the improved charge transport from mobility measurements (below) should contribute to the enhanced device performance.

(b) Photoluminescence spectra of the PM6 neat film, binary blends (0%, 100%) and ternary blends (15%, 20% and 25%) excited at 550 nm.

A space charge limited current (SCLC) method was used to check the charge transport properties of the binary and ternary blends (see Fig. S11 and Table S3, ESI†). For the PM6:Y6 binary blend, hole and electron mobilities were measured to be 2.29 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.83 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. After adding 20% BTP-M, the hole mobility increased to 3.38 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the electron mobility decreased to 1.35 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The improvement in the hole mobility should be responsible for the photocurrent enhancement among the donor absorption ranges. The reason for such a hole mobility enhancement could be the increase in polymer donor crystallinity, which is proven in the blend morphology characterization below. The slight decrease in the electron mobility is caused by the reduced crystallinity and aggregation of the acceptor phase, as proved by the above DSC and the following morphology characterizations. Even though, PM6:Y6:BTP-M blends still own both high hole and electron mobilities, assuring a good charge transport property, and thus maintaining a high FF for the relevant TOSCs. For the PM6:BTP-M binary blend, both the hole and electron mobilities are lower with values of 0.79 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.52 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The reduced mobilities for the PM6:BTP-M binary blend may be caused by the unfavorable blend morphology and relatively more severe charge recombination, as disclosed by the following characterizations.
To track charge recombination in the binary and ternary blends, we measured the J–V curves under various light intensities and the results are shown in Fig. 3c and d. The relationship between Jsc and light intensity (Plight) can be described as Jsc ∝ Pαlight and α = 1 represents the ideal charge transport with minimal bimolecular recombination.61 The calculated α values of 0%, 20% and 100% blends are found to be 0.982, 0.989, 0.984, indicating the bimolecular recombination is reduced a bit in the ternary blend.
The relationship between Voc and Plight can be described as Voc ∝ nkT/eln(Plight) (k is Boltzmann's constant, T is absolute temperature and e is the elementary charge). The slopes are calculated as 1.14kT/e, 1.10kT/e and 1.03 kT/e, indicating that the monomolecular recombination is also hindered in the ternary blends. The mitigated charge recombination is also beneficial for maintaining a high FF in TOSCs, and may originate from the optimized morphology, as demonstrated below.
Blend morphology
Besides the influences in charge behaviors, the formation of an alloy-like composite may also bring benefits in morphology optimization, so it's necessary to check the blend morphology variations. At first, the morphologies of the binary and ternary blends were studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. As shown in Fig. 4, Y6 shows a stronger aggregation tendency than BTP-M. After adding BTP-M, the morphology of the ternary blend was modified with a better dispersity and optimized domain sizes, compared with those of the PM6:Y6 binary blend. The TEM images further confirm the phenomena in the changes of dispersity and domain sizes between the binary and ternary blends.62 The optimized dispersity and domain sizes of the ternary blend can be beneficial for the reduced monomolecular and bimolecular recombination, as discussed above. For the PM6:BTP-M binary blend, no obvious phase-separation domains were observed, suggesting that an interpenetrating network for charge transportation is not well formed, corresponding to the relatively low hole and electron mobilities.

Then, the crystallinity and molecular orientation of the pure materials and blend films were studied by grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) characterization and the results are presented in Fig. 5.63,64 The neat PM6 film shows a lamellar peak at q ≈ 0.31 Å−1 (d = 20.3 Å) in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction and another lamellar peak at q ≈ 0.29 Å−1 (d = 21.7 Å) in the in-plane (IP) direction, consistent with previous reports.65 The π–π stacking peak is at q ≈ 1.69 Å−1 (d = 3.72 Å) in the OOP direction. The neat Y6 film demonstrates the preferred face-on orientation with a strong π–π stacking peak at q ≈ 1.77 Å−1 (d = 3.55 Å) in the OOP direction, and a lamellar peak at q ≈ 0.30 Å−1 (d = 20.9 Å) and a backbone peak at q ≈ 0.42 Å−1 (d = 15.0 Å) in the IP direction due to the terminal group π–π stacking.13 For neat BTP-M film, a strong lamellar peak at q ≈ 0.31 Å−1 in the OOP direction and another lamellar peak at q ≈ 0.29 Å−1 in the IP direction are present, signifying the co-existence of edge-on and face-on orientations. The weak π–π stacking peak is at q ≈ 1.68 Å−1 (d = 3.74 Å) in the OOP direction. It is suggested that the terminal group modification has changed the face-on dominant packing of Y6 to the bimodal molecular packing of BTP-M.

The scattering patterns of the blend films are very similar to one another, indicating the face-on oriented molecular packing. For the 20% film, as implied by the mobility variations above, the Y6:BTP-M acceptor alloy displayed a slightly reduced crystallinity over that of the 0% film, which can be compensated by the enhanced crystallinity of the PM6 donor, giving an overall good phase morphology in the blend film. For the 100% film, the high crystallinity may be induced by the interactions between PM6 and BTP-M, which have been disclosed by PL and AFM characterizations. The peaks corresponding to the lamellar stacking and backbone ordering stay at q ≈ 0.30 Å−1 and 0.42 Å−1 respectively. Interestingly, the backbone feature could be found in the 100% blend film also, although it was not observed in the neat BTP-M film. The π–π stacking peaks in the OOP direction are located at q ≈ 1.75 Å−1 (d = 3.59 Å). The similar patterns between the ternary film and the binary films show that the two acceptors are compatible with each other as the crystal packing is not disrupted by ternary mixing, indicating the probability of forming a non-fullerene acceptor alloy. Moreover, the crystal structure remains similar and the crystallinity becomes higher when the thickness of the ternary film increases, which may allow the devices with thicker films to retain their high performance, as shown below. The simultaneous enhancement of the donor's and acceptor's crystallinities in thicker films represents the benefit of the alloy model in morphology optimization capability.
Thick-film TOSCs
Since an alloy composed of two non-fullerene acceptors can work as one material and realizes a good morphology control in TOSCs, we were inspired to fabricate thick-film TOSCs and explore the effects of active layer thickness on the device performance. We then fabricated thick-film TOSCs based on the optimal ternary blends (20%). The results are displayed in Fig. 6 and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 6b, the broad and high EQE values were all maintained for thick-film devices, and a champion EQE value of 92% was reached for the 160 nm device. The integrated current densities Jcalc. from the EQE curves are close to the Jsc from the J–V curves with a small error (less than 3%) (see Table 1). The observed changes of the onsets of the EQE curves are consistent with the measured absorptions of the ternary blend (20%) thick films (Fig. S12, ESI†). With the increase of thickness from 120 nm to 400 nm, both Voc and Jsc remained nearly the same, while FF reduced to some extent. The loss in FF is partly related to the slightly increased bimolecular recombination (Fig. S13, ESI†), which is reasonable because some charges need to move through longer paths to reach the electrodes in thicker films. However, thick films can exhibit higher charge transport properties than thin films, especially the electron mobility, which is confirmed in the SCLC measurements (Table S3, ESI†). Besides, GIWAXS measurements also show that a similar crystal structure is retained and an enhanced crystallinity, especially π–π stacking peaks, is present for thicker films, which conforms to the results of the SCLC measurements. At the same time, strong aggregations can be also be held back by the Y6:BTP-M acceptor alloy to achieve an efficient exciton dissociation, which is demonstrated by the above morphology measurements. As a result, a high photocurrent can be maintained for thick-film TOSCs. Finally, a 14.23% efficiency is realized for TOSCs with a 300 nm active layer, which is outstanding for fullerene-free OSCs.

Conclusions
In conclusion, by rational molecular design, we successfully constructed an alloy-like composite (Y6:BTP-M) with tunable material properties and applied it to obtain high-performance TOSCs with optimized energy levels and morphologies. Due to the elevated energy levels of the alloy, energy loss was mitigated from 0.49 eV for the binary device to 0.45 eV for the ternary device. Due to the optimized domain sizes and the maintained good charge transport properties, the external quantum efficiencies are obviously enhanced over a wide wavelength range covering the absorption of the donor and acceptor from around 80% for the binary device to over 86% for the ternary device. As a result, the optimal TOSCs exhibit a best efficiency of 17.03%. Besides, the formation of an alloy-like composite also allows the enhancement of hole and electron mobilities in thick films when fine phase-separations are kept, thus resulting in over 14% efficiency for TOSCs of 300 nm. Our work provides a good strategy for constructing highly efficient TOSCs via the design of an alloy-like acceptor composite, which enables the simultaneous mitigation of energy loss and the enhancement of quantum efficiencies.

Broader context
Organic solar cells (OSCs), with their light weight, low-cost and mechanical flexibility properties, provide a green approach for light energy harvesting. For practical applications, the efficiency remains the first critical issue to solve. Non-fullerene acceptors have recently boosted the efficiencies of OSCs to over 16%. One typical binary system is PM6:Y6. Herein, we designed a new non-fullerene acceptor named BTP-M, which was added into a PM6:Y6 blend as the third component to further improve the efficiency of PM6:Y6-based OSCs. It was found that an alloy-like model based on Y6 and BTP-M was formed, which helps lower the energy loss and boost the quantum efficiency, thus addressing the trade-off between voltage and photocurrent well. As a result, a best efficiency of 17.03% was achieved for single-junction OSCs with a thin film of 120 nm and over 14% efficiency was maintained for devices with a thick film of 300 nm.
