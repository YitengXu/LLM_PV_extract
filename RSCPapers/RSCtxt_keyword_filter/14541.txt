    , Accepted 1st December 2013First published on 2nd December 2013AbstractTwo conjugated donor–acceptor copolymers based on a benzodithiophene donor unit and a fluorinated quinoxaline acceptor unit, spaced with either thiophene or thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridges, were designed and synthesized. The effect of different π-bridges and of the processing conditions on optical, electrical, morphological and photovoltaic properties of the polymer:fullerene blend films were investigated. The polymer containing the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge (PBDTFQ-TT) showed a red-shifted absorption and an enhanced charge carrier mobility, as compared to its analogue with the thiophene π-bridge (PBDTFQ-T), due to its narrower optical gap (by ∼0.1 eV) and stronger inter-chain interactions, favored by the structural planarity and increased linearity of the polymer backbone, as also supported by DFT calculations. The blend of PBDTFQ-TT and PC61BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester), compared to the PBDTFQ-T:PC61BM one processed under the same conditions (by blade-coating technique), showed greatly enhanced photovoltaic performance, with more than doubled power conversion efficiency (PCE up to 5.60% for the best device) due to the increased short-circuit current density and fill factor. However, similar PCEs were also achieved for PBDTFQ-T:PC61BM-based devices by optimizing the processing conditions through the addition of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as the solvent additive. Through morphological and electrical analysis of the films, produced with and without additive, it was observed that the addition of DIO greatly enhances the self-organization, and consequently the charge mobility, of the thiophene π-bridge-based polymer, while it was detrimental for the nanoscale morphology and photovoltaic performances of the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge-based polymer in the corresponding blend.
1. Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are promising technology for manufacturing large-area, lightweight and flexible solar cells through low-cost and low-temperature solution processing techniques.1 Conjugated polymers and fullerene derivatives are the typical constituents of the active layer in so-called bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells, in which these two materials, acting as an electron donor and an electron acceptor respectively, are deposited as a finely intermixed blend film sandwiched between two electrodes.2 Rapidly increasing power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), as high as 8.5%3 for conventional single-junction solar cells and 9.35%4 for inverted structure ones, have been achieved through the development of new materials, as well as through device processing and architecture optimization.5 In particular, the properties of the polymeric photoactive materials are one of the most determining factors on the overall performance of the final solar cells.6 An ideal polymeric electron donor should present a broad absorption spectrum with a high absorption coefficient,7 a good hole mobility,8 suitable energies of the frontier molecular orbitals matching those of the acceptor9 and appropriate film forming and nano-structuring ability once blended with the acceptor, to form a photoactive layer with nano-segregated and bicontinuous interpenetrating donor:acceptor (D:A) domains. A well-known strategy to obtain efficient donor polymers is to alternate electron-rich and electron-deficient conjugated moieties in the backbone.10 In these push–pull architectures, both donor and acceptor units as well as the conjugated π-bridging groups, if used, inserted between them as spacers, play a fundamental role. Nevertheless, while much effort has been devoted to the study of new donor and acceptor building blocks, only recently increased attention has been given to the π-bridges.11 Indeed, conjugated π-bridges strongly affect the electronic structure of push–pull polymers, and consequently their optical and electrical properties, for instance by (i) contributing to the π-electron density and (ii) mediating the electronic interaction between the push and pull moieties, thus affecting the spatial distribution of the molecular orbitals over the polymer backbone. Moreover, π-bridges also affect the structural conformation of the polymer chains, by introducing rigidity and planarity or torsion angles on the backbone and by favoring or hindering inter-chain interactions. In push–pull polymers, π-conjugated spacers range from vinylenes,12 ethylenes,13 to aromatic rings such as thiophenes,14 furans11e,15 and selenophenes.15b,16 In addition, the introduction of fused aromatic units, such as thieno[3,2-b]thiophene,11e,17 has recently attracted much interest. In fact, the centrosymmetric, rigid and coplanar structure of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene ensures a high delocalization of the π-electrons over the polymer backbone and also favors intermolecular π–π stacking, resulting in red-shifted absorption, reduced band gap and enhanced charge mobility.18 For these reasons, this π-conjugated bridge has been successfully applied as a spacer in push–pull polymers for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs).19 In an earlier report, an OFET hole mobility improvement by one or two orders of magnitude was found when the thiophene bridge was replaced by thieno[3,2-b]thiophene.20 Thieno[3,2-b]thiophene has also been applied as a π-bridging group in push–pull semiconducting polymers for photovoltaic applications, such as in carbazole–benzothiadiazole17 and benzodithiophene–benzothiadiazole11e,21 polymer systems, and comparative studies with analogous polymers containing a single thiophene ring as the spacer have been reported. It has to be noted that in all these cases the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-based oligomers or polymers showed decreased solubility at room temperature. However, they exhibited red-shifted light absorption spectra and higher charge carrier mobility (by two orders of magnitude) compared to the analogous thiophene containing polymers, due to the band gap narrowing (by ∼0.1 eV) and stronger intermolecular interactions favored by the structural planarity and linearity of the polymer backbone.
The easy method of getting high-performance semiconducting polymers by changing the π-bridging group between the donor and acceptor moieties prompted us to apply it to the class of efficient push–pull polymers based on benzodithiophene (4,8-bis(3-butylnonyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, or BDT) and fluorinated quinoxaline (6,7-difluoro-2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline, or FQ) units. Herein, we discuss the synthesis, optical, electrical and OPV properties of two polymers (PBDTFQ-T and PBDTFQ-TT, Fig. 1) having either thiophene (T) or thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) groups as π-bridging units inserted between BDT and FQ, respectively. We also use theoretical calculations to investigate the effect of these two different π-conjugated spacers on the electronic structure, chain conformation and related properties of the two polymers. In this work, differently from other studies on thiophene or thieno[3,2-b]thiophene spaced polymers, these two polymers have both identical donor and acceptor building blocks, including side chains. This allows us to compare the properties of the two polymers on the basis of the different π–spacer nature. An unavoidable drawback of this choice is the big difference in the solubility of the two corresponding monomers and of oligomers/polymers during polymerization that affects the relative molecular masses of the final products. The two polymers were employed as donor materials in BHJ OPV devices together with PC61BM ([6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester) as the acceptor. The polymer with the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge (PBDTFQ-TT) showed higher efficiency compared to the thiophene-based analogue (PBDTFQ-T) in devices prepared under the same processing conditions, in accordance with the results found in the literature for similar systems.17,21 However, we found that through an appropriate optimization of the active layer processing conditions, such as the use of a solvent additive (DIO), similarly high efficiencies were obtained for PBDTFQ-T as well.

In addition, it is worth emphasizing that all OPV devices investigated in this work were fabricated via doctor-blading in air, which represents an important step for the up-scaling of the OPV devices production to large areas, with minimized material losses and low-cost processes.
2. Experimental
2.1 General
The synthesis of the monomers and polymers is described in the ESI. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were acquired from a Varian Inova 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. Tetramethylsilane was used as an internal reference with deuterated chloroform as solvent. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on Waters Alliance GPCV2000 with a refractive index detector, with columns: Waters Styragel® HT 6E×1, Waters Styragel® HMW 6E×2. The eluent was 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, the working temperature was 135 °C, and the resolution time was 2 hours. The concentration of the samples was 0.5 mg mL−1, which was filtered (filter: 0.45 μm) prior to the analysis. The relative molecular masses were calculated by calibration relative to polystyrene standards. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra were measured with a PerkinElmer Lambda 900 UV-vis-NIR absorption spectrometer.
Square-wave voltammetry (SWV) measurements were carried out on a CH-Instruments 650A Electrochemical Workstation. A three-electrode setup was used with platinum wires both as a working electrode and a counter electrode, and Ag/Ag+ used as a reference electrode calibrated with Fc/Fc+. A 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in anhydrous acetonitrile was used as a supporting electrolyte. The polymers were deposited onto the working electrode from chloroform solution. In order to remove oxygen from the electrolyte, the system was bubbled with nitrogen prior to each experiment. The nitrogen inlet was then moved above the liquid surface and left there during the scans. HOMO and LUMO levels were deduced from their respective ionization potentials and electron affinities, estimated from peak potentials of the third scan by setting the oxidative peak potential of Fc/Fc+vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) to 0.63 V22 and the NHE vs. the vacuum level to 4.5 V.23
2.2 OPV device fabrication and characterization
Patterned ITO-coated glasses (Rs ∼10 Ω □−1) were cleaned in sequential sonicating baths (for 15 min) of deionized water, acetone and isopropanol. After the final sonication step, substrates were dried with a stream of N2 gas and then placed in an oxygen plasma chamber for 10 min. Next, a thin layer (∼30 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP Al 4083) was spun-cast on the ITO surface and subsequently annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. The active layers were prepared using the blade-coating technique. For both polymers the doctor blade conditions used for the best devices were a volume of hot solution of 40 μL, a hotplate at 60 °C, a blade height of 100 μm and a speed of 12.5 mm s−1. For the devices, polymer concentrations of 15 mg mL−1 and 10 mg mL−1 in ODCB were used for PBDTFQ-TT and PBDTFQ-T respectively. The mixture solutions were stirred overnight at 80 °C. To complete the device fabrication, LiF and Al (0.6 nm and 100 nm) were deposited sequentially without breaking vacuum (∼3 × 10−6 Torr) using a thermal evaporator directly connected to the glove box. The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of all OPV devices were recorded by a Keithley 236 source-measure unit under simulated AM1.5G illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (Abet Technologies Sun 2000 Solar Simulator). The light intensity was determined by a calibrated silicon solar cell fitted with a KG5 color glass filter to bring spectral mismatch to unity. The active area of the solar cell was exactly 6 mm2. During testing, each cell was carefully masked, by a calibrated mask, to prevent an excess photocurrent generated from the parasitic device regions outside the overlapped electrodes area. All solar cells were tested inside the glove box in oxygen and moisture free environment.
External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) was measured with a home-built system on encapsulated devices; monochromatic light was obtained with a Xenon arc lamp from Lot-Oriel (300 Watt power) coupled with a Spectra-Pro monochromator. The photocurrent produced by the device passed through a calibrated resistance (50 Ω) and the voltage drop signal was collected through the resistance with a Lock-In Digital Amplifier-SR830. The signal was pulsed by means of an optical chopper (∼300 Hz frequency). A calibrated silicon photodiode was used as reference.
2.3 Thin-film characterization
All thin-film characterizations were performed in air. Solution and thin film optical absorption spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-550 spectrophotometer. The thickness of the various films was measured by a profilometer (KLA Tencor, P-6). All active films were characterized on glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrates and subsequently corrected for the background signal, in order to reproduce the effective condition and the real nanomorphology of the active layer. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images were taken with a Solver Pro (NT-934 MDT) scanning probe microscope in tapping mode. The AFM images were recorded directly on the tested devices.
The hole mobility of the photosensitive layers was measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method using devices with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC61BM/Au. The processing conditions used for the active layers were the optimized ones. Charge mobility was extracted by fitting the current density–voltage curves, recorded under dark conditions, with the Mott–Gurney equation.24
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis of monomers and polymers
The chemical structures of the two quinoxaline–BDT based polymers (PBDTFQ-T and PBDTFQ-TT) are shown in Fig. 1.
The synthesis of the monomers and polymers is shown in Scheme 1. 5,8-Dibromo-6,7-difluoro-2,3-bis(3-(octyloxy)phenyl)quinoxaline (1) was prepared following the previously reported procedure.6c,25
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of the monomers and polymers. 
Stille coupling reaction between compound 1 and tributyl(thiophen-2-yl)stannane yielded compound 2 while similar reaction between compound 1 and tributyl(thieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl)stannane yielded 4. Bromination of compound 2 and compound 4 with NBS in THF gave compound 3 and compound 5, respectively (Scheme 1). Both the final monomers and the intermediate compounds were purified with either recrystallization or precipitation from appropriate solvents.
The other co-monomer (4,8-bis(3-butylnonyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (10) was synthesized according to the reaction sequence shown in Scheme 1 following the previously published procedure.6d,26 Dilithiation of 1-heptyne (6) followed by monoalkylation with n-hexyl bromide in dry hexane as a solvent yielded compound 7. The Grignard reagent prepared by treating compound 7 with isopropyl magnesium chloride was reacted with benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-4,8-dione to give an intermediate compound which was treated with SnCl2·2H2O in 10% hydrochloric acid to yield compound 8. Compound 8 was reduced to compound 9 by using H2/Pd/C as a reducing agent. Compound 9 was converted into the corresponding distannylated monomer (10) which was purified by recrystallization with isopropanol. PBDTFQ-T and PBDTFQ-TT were prepared by Stille coupling polymerization reaction between the corresponding monomers (Scheme 1) catalyzed by Pd2(dba)3/P(o-Tolyl)3. As expected, monomer 5 resulted to be less soluble than monomer 3. Thus a small amount of dimethyl formamide (DMF) was added to toluene in order to enhance the solubility of monomer 5 during the polymerization reaction of PBDTFQ-TT, while only toluene was used as a solvent for the synthesis of PBDTFQ-T. As a result, a difference in the obtainable relative molecular masses of the two resulting polymers is expected, due to the above-mentioned reasons, as also reported in the literature for similar thieno[3,2-b]thiophene and thiophene spaced push–pull polymers.11e,17,21 The two polymers were purified by washing with 10% aqueous sodium diethyl dithiocarbamate solution and by Soxhlet extraction with different solvents. The number (MN) and mass (MW) average molar masses of the polymers, determined with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) versus polystyrene standards, are summarized in Table 1. As expected, PBDTFQ-T exhibits a higher molar mass, with MN of 101 kDa and MW of 270 kDa, while the corresponding values for PBDTFQ-TT are 15 kDa and 42 kDa, respectively.

3.2 Electrochemical and optical properties
SWV was employed to examine the electrochemical properties and estimate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers respectively from the oxidation and reduction peak values (Table 1 and Fig. 2). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBDTFQ-T were deduced to be −6.00 and −3.63 eV, respectively, while those of PBDTFQ-TT −5.90 and −3.52 eV, respectively. Interestingly, both polymers exhibit deep HOMO energy levels, which would result in devices with a high VOC, according to the difference LUMOACCEPTOR − HOMODONOR.27 Moreover, the measured HOMO energies are in an ideal range to ensure good air stability.28
 Fig. 2  Square-wave voltammograms of the polymers in thin films. 
Considering that the LUMO levels of the typical electron acceptors PC61BM and PC71BM are located at −4.03 and −4.13 eV respectively,29 the offset between the LUMO of the donor polymer and that of the molecular acceptor (LUMODONOR − LUMOACCEPTOR), ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 eV, provides a driving force to ensure an efficient exciton dissociation.
The slightly higher lying HOMO energy of PBDTFQ-TT compared to PBDTFQ-T (by ∼0.10 eV) is in agreement with the other cases of thiophene and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene bridged donor–acceptor polymers reported in the literature.11e,17,21 In fact, the relatively higher electron density of the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene spacer compared to the thiophene one attenuates the push–pull character of the polymer (PBDTFQ-TT) and slightly raises its molecular energy levels.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of both PBDTFQ-T and PBDTFQ-TT (Fig. 3) show the same features: a higher-energy absorption band between 380 and 480 nm, which can be assigned to localized π–π* transitions, and a lower-energy band between 500 and 700 nm, arising from the intramolecular charge-transfer-like interactions between the electron-rich BDT and electron-poor quinoxaline units11e and from the intermolecular interactions between the polymer chains. The difference in the position of the absorption bands registered can be ascribed to the different structures of the π-bridges in the polymers. Indeed, PBDTFQ-TT shows a broader absorption band with a red-shifted onset compared to PBDTFQ-T (Table 1). This could be due to the more linear and planar geometry of the backbone of PBDTFQ-TT, favoring the overlap between the π-orbitals along the polymeric chain and extending the conjugation length30 as also confirmed by theoretical studies (reported below). Moreover, with the enhanced backbone linearity of PBDTFQ-TT, the interchain packing, and hence red-shifted absorption onset, is promoted in the solid state. Indeed, the resulting optical gap (Eoptg) of PBDTFQ-TT is slightly lower (1.71 eV) compared to PBDTFQ-T (1.77 eV), as also confirmed by DFT calculations. It is worth mentioning that the optical gaps of these two polymers are smaller than their respective electrochemical band gaps (ca. 2.4 eV), in agreement with the literature.6c,31 This can be due to the fact that for conjugated polymers, the electron and hole remain electrostatically bound to one another in the excited state after light absorption (in contrast to the ionized state in the electrochemical measurements).31a Also polymer interchain interactions can generally result in a reduction in optical gaps in the solid state absorption, as compared to electrochemical band gaps.6c,31c In addition, the interface barrier between the polymer film and the electrode surface can further cause a difference, which makes the electrochemical band gaps even larger.31b
 Fig. 3  Normalized absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform solution (soln) and in thin films (film) deposited on glass. 
For polymer PBDTFQ-T, a red shift of the onset (by ∼40 nm) and of the absorption maxima (by ∼12 nm) when passing from solution to the thin film is observed, indicating that π–π intermolecular interactions occur in the solid state. In addition, PBDTFQ-T displays vibronic features both in solution and in the thin film, implying the presence of ordered π–π stacks likely due to polymeric chain entanglements, difficult to dissolve even in diluted solutions owing to the high molecular mass of the polymer.11e,32 In comparison, PBDTFQ-TT shows a smaller red shift of the absorption onset (by ∼10 nm), when passing from solution to the film. This could be due to (i) the lower molecular mass of PBDTFQ-TT, compared to PBDTFQ-T, which renders easier the polymer solubilization and chain disentanglements; (ii) the planar and linear geometry of the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π–spacer, compared to thiophene, which imparts a more linear conformation to the polymer.33
3.3 Theoretical calculations
Quantum-chemical calculations by the density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level34 using the Gaussian 09 program35 were employed to analyze the electronic structure of these polymers. For computational simplification, the alkoxy side chains on the quinoxaline acceptor unit were replaced with methoxy groups, the branched alkyl side chains on the BDT unit were replaced with methyl groups, and the backbones were simplified to two repeating units. All the optimized molecular structures are in a stable local minimum of the ground state potential energy surface, and analytical second derivatives of the Hessian matrix were calculated at the same level of theory to ensure this.
In order to obtain more accurate results, we first needed to determine the conformations of the structure units of the two polymers. As the BDT unit is a centrosymmetric fused unit, we assume a trans conformation between the BDT unit and the bridging group (i.e. thiophene or thieno[3,2-b]thiophene), to minimize the steric hindrance as well as the potential energy of the whole systems.36 More attention was given to resolve the conformation between the quinoxaline unit and the bridging group. Notably, even if different conformations (i.e. syn-conformation defects) may be adopted between the BDT unit and the bridging group, they still result in the same conclusions which can be made in our computational analysis below to resolve the conformation between the quinoxaline unit and the bridging group (i.e. thiophene or thieno[3,2-b]thiophene). In the case of thiophene as a π-bridge, as shown in Fig. 4, there are three possible conformers to be resolved. We performed DFT calculations for these possible conformations by using the two-repeating-unit model, because there are two joints in the π-bridge flanking FQ (π–A–π) segment for the BDT units to bond with. The optimized geometries obtained are depicted in Fig. S21 (ESI†). The potential energies of the three conformers of the π–A–π segments decrease in the order 121 > 112 > 111 for both the thiophene and the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene spacers. However, in the optimized geometries of the corresponding dimers (Fig. S21, ESI†), additional factors could determine the lower conformation energy, other than that of the π–A–π segment, such as the presence of bulky side chains. For example, the lowering of the potential energy through the minimization of the steric hindrance between the bulky side chains on the BDT unit and on the FQ one may prevail. In fact, in the case with the thiophene bridge, the distance between the benzyl carbon on the BDT unit and the closest oxygen atom on the adjacent quinoxaline units, L2, is 4.0 Å for the dimer with π–A–π conformations 111 or 112, while it is 9.5 Å for the dimer with the π–A–π conformation 121. We therefore postulate that, for polymer PBDTFQ-T, the conformation 121 of the π–A–π segment is favored because it allows a minimum steric hindrance in the presence of adjacent bulky side chains. Such conformation preference may already occur in the polymerization of PBDTFQ-T.
 Fig. 4  Possible conformers of π-bridges flanking FQ (π–A–π) segments. 
On the other hand, in the case of the dimers with the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene bridge, the steric hindrance of lateral alkyl chains is strongly reduced: the distance between the benzyl carbon atom on the BDT unit and the closest oxygen atom on the adjacent quinoxaline units, L2, is in any case comparable (9.4 Å). As a consequence, thanks to the rigidity and centrosymmetry of the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene unit, the three possible conformations of the dimers are all linear and have similar spatial orientation of the side chains. Then for polymer PBDTFQ-TT the conformation where the π–A–π unit has the lowest potential energy, which is conformation 111, is favored. It has to be mentioned that for PBDTFQ-TT, other possible conformations between the quinoxaline unit and the π-bridge may exist, as well as between the BDT unit and the π-bridge, but the polymer backbone linearity would be maintained. The linear backbone of PBDTFQ-TT, compared to the curved backbone of PBDTFQ-T, presumably favors inter-chain stacking/packing and leads to improved charge mobility.18,37
The optimized molecular geometries of the two-repeating-unit models (PBDTFQ-T_121 and PBDTFQ-TT_111) and their frontier molecular orbitals are shown in Fig. S22 (ESI†). The computed HOMO and LUMO energy levels for PBDTFQ-T_121 are −4.90 eV and −2.59 eV respectively, with an energy gap of 2.31 eV, while for PBDTFQ-TT_111 the HOMO and LUMO levels are −4.85 eV and −2.68 eV, respectively, with an energy gap of 2.17 eV. The HOMO levels are in agreement with the ionization potentials estimated by SWV, with a slight increase in energy when passing from the thiophene to the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene based polymer. On the other hand, the decrease in the LUMO energy, computed by DFT, when going from thiophene to thieno[3,2-b]thiophene cases, was not observed by SWV. The band gap narrowing when going from the thiophene to the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene based polymers observed by DFT calculations is in agreement with the optical gap deduced from the UV-vis absorption spectra. This band gap difference can be explained through the increased charge-transfer-like interactions of the PBDTFQ-TT polymer compared to PBDTFQ-T. This is confirmed by the shortening of the bond length between the π-bridge and the FQ unit in the π–A–π segment when passing from the optimized structure PBDTFQ-T_121 to the PBDTFQ-TT_111 one.
Different π-bridge units significantly affect the molecular architecture. As can be seen from Table 2, both polymers have an optimized structure with in-plane backbones, with a slightly more planar geometry for the model of PBDTFQ-TT than that of PBDTFQ-T. For example, as shown in Table 2, the torsion angles (θ5 and θ6) between the quinoxaline and BDT units along the backbone are ca. 2.6–4.7° for PBDTFQ-TTvs. ca. 11.4–12.4° for PBDTFQ-T. Moreover, for PBDTFQ-TT a linear backbone conformation can be adopted while PBDTFQ-T shows a backbone curvature (Fig. S22, ESI†). For instance, the angles (Φ) between the two closest BDT units along the backbone are ca. 173.5° and ca. 147.3° for PBDTFQ-TT and PBDTFQ-T, respectively (Table 2). This may result in a significant difference in interchain stacking and charge mobility.38

3.4 Photovoltaic performances
To investigate the effects of π-conjugated bridges on the photovoltaic properties of PBDTFQ-T and PBDTFQ-TT, they have been employed as donor (D) materials in BHJ solar cells, with PC61BM as an acceptor (A) counterpart, in the conventional device configuration glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al. Further details for the device fabrication and characterization are given in the Experimental section. The photovoltaic responses including VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE of optimized devices are summarized in Table 3 while representative current density–voltage (J–V) plots, measured under standard illumination (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), are shown in Fig. 5.

The optimal D:A ratio was 1:1 (w/w) for both materials; upon increasing or decreasing it lower OPV responses were observed (Table S1, ESI†). By comparing the performances of devices prepared under the same conditions, the one based on PBDTFQ-T:PC61BM (1:1 w/w) showed a low PCE (2.18%), mainly due to a low JSC (−5.46 mA cm−2) and FF (46%) (Table 3). On the other hand, the device based on PBDTFQ-TT:PC61BM (1:1 w/w) showed more than doubled PCE, as high as 5.29%, (5.60% for the best device), with VOC = 0.82 V, JSC = −10.87 mA cm−2 and FF = 59%. The doubled JSC is explicable through the effect of the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene spacer in enhancing the polymer long-wavelength range absorption and charge mobility (see hole mobility measurements). Moreover, the improvement in FF could be due to the formation of an optimal blend film morphology,39 facilitated by the presence of the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene which favors a linear polymer backbone and promotes inter-chain packing, as confirmed by DFT calculations. In order to optimize the photovoltaic performances of PBDTFQ-T through the optimization of its blend nanomorphology, a 3% (v/v) of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added to the active layer solution.40 As a result, the JSC of the PBDTFQ-T:PC61BM-based device was almost doubled (−9.18 mA cm−2) and FF grew up to 67%, resulting in a PCE of 5.30% (5.68% for the best device). Presumably, the presence of a solvent additive (i.e. DIO), with selective solubility of the fullerene, in the PBDTFQ-T:PC61BM blend promotes the molecular re-organization by controlling the kinetics of segregation and crystallization of the BHJ components during the drying process, leading to an overall blend film morphology with optimal phase intermixing, separation and continuity.40a,c In contrast, the addition of 3% of DIO to the PBDTFQ-TT:PC61BM-based blend led to a drastic drop in PCE (3.19%), due to a decrease in VOC (0.75 V), FF (45%) and JSC (−9.53 mA cm−2). This means that an optimal nanomorphology is obtained without the need for additive in the case of PBDTFQ-TT, thanks to the presence of the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridge. Note that the promising PCEs reached by these polymers in combination with the low-absorbing PC61BM acceptor allow their possible application as bottom active layer materials in tandem devices.41 In fact, their partial spectral coverage would enable some light to pass towards the top active layer which is typically composed of a polymer:PC71BM blend.
Different annealing temperatures and times were experimented on the polymer:PC61BM-based active layers in order to further enhance the device performance, but no improvement was achieved (see ESI†). In addition, both polymers were tested in solar cells with PC71BM (instead of PC61BM) as the acceptor, in order to increase the absorption spectral coverage of the active layer. Nevertheless, the devices prepared by using the optimized processing conditions found for PC61BM-based cells showed inferior photovoltaic performances (see Table S1 in ESI†).
In Fig. 6a, the UV-vis absorption spectra (linear absorption coefficient) of the optimized blends PBDTFQ-T:PC61BM and PBDTFQ-TT:PC61BM (1:1 w/w), with and without additive, are reported.

It can be noted that the use of DIO in the blends does not induce relevant spectral shifts.40a However, in both cases, the linear absorption coefficient is slightly higher in the presence of the additive, likely due to an enhanced π-stacking of the polymer in the blend, as supported by the improved charge mobilities (vide infra). In the case of the PBDTFQ-T-based device, this resulted in an improved photovoltaic performance, while for PBDTFQ-TT an excessive polymer aggregation and blend phases separation, confirmed by AFM studies, cause a negative effect in the device performance.40d The EQE spectra of the best polymer:PC61BM based devices, as shown in Fig. 6b, have spectral features which are consistent with the corresponding blend absorption spectra (Fig. 6a), with higher values for the PBDTFQ-T-based blend compared to the PBDTFQ-TT-based one (60% and 56% on the maximum respectively, corresponding to the relative absorption maxima of the polymers). Convolution of these spectra with the AM1.5 solar spectrum gives calculated short-circuit current densities in good agreement, within a ∼10% experimental error, with those obtained from J–V measurements.
3.5 Thin-film morphology and charge carrier mobility
To get insight into the influence of the π-bridges and of the processing conditions on the electrical properties of the two polymers and corresponding blends, the hole mobility (μh) of the polymer:fullerene films in hole-only devices was extrapolated through the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. The charge mobilities of the two polymers blended with PC61BM and processed under the same conditions (DCB without DIO) are quite different: 1.1 × 10−4 cm2 (V−1 s−1) and 3.7 × 10−4 cm2 (V−1 s−1) for PBDTFQ-T and PBDTFQ-TT respectively. This reflects the inferior (halved) photovoltaic performance, in particular the lower JSC, of the PBDTFQ-T-based blend compared to the PBDTFQ-TT-based one, under these experimental conditions.
As expected, the PBDTFQ-T:PC61BM film processed with DIO gives an increase in the hole mobility up to 3.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, reaching almost the same value as the optimized PBDTFQ-TT-based blend and following the same trend observed for the corresponding photovoltaic performances.
It is well-known that the nanomorphology of the BHJ active layer plays an important role in determining the OPV performance.42 In order to get a deeper insight on the effects of the conjugated spacer and of the additive on the morphology of the two polymers-based blend films, tapping-mode AFM images of the active layers of optimized cells, prepared with and without the DIO additive, were registered (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 7  AFM images (size 5 μm × 5 μm) of the blend films: (a) PBDTFQ-T:PC61BM processed without DIO (RMS = 1.3 nm); (b) PBDTFQ-TT:PC61BM processed without DIO (RMS = 2.2 nm); (c) PBDTFQ-T:PC61BM processed with DIO (RMS = 1.5 nm) and (d) PBDTFQ-TT:PC61BM processed with DIO (RMS = 2.5 nm). 
By comparing the AFM topography of PBDTFQ-T:PC61BM and PBDTFQ-TT:PC61BM blend films prepared without DIO, it can be noted that the latter presents a more structured topography with a slightly higher roughness (RMS = 2.2 nm) compared to the former film, which in turn shows finer and regular unconnected grains, or small circular islands, accompanied by a lower roughness (RMS = 1.3 nm) (Fig. 7a and b, respectively). This is in agreement with the trend evidenced for the JSC and hole mobility of the corresponding devices, due to the higher tendency of PBDTFQ-TT to form π-stacked aggregates.
The addition of DIO to the PBDTFQ-T:PC61BM-based blend leads to an improved morphology by generating more organized nanostructures and promoting an optimal D:A intermixing, compared to the pristine PBDTFQ-T:PC61BM-based blend film, indicating that the use of the additive promotes both the phase separation between the BHJ components and also the formation of more ordered and aggregated polymeric domains, as discussed above. This favors charge separation and transport in the corresponding device, in agreement with the doubled photocurrent (Table 3) and increased hole mobility.
Diversely, the addition of the additive (DIO) to the PBDTFQ-TT:PC61BM-based blend film leads to the formation of evident aggregates which suggests a probable higher phase separation between polymer and fullerene. This is likely due to the stronger tendency to intermolecular π-stacking of PBDTFQ-TT compared to PBDTFQ-T. This kind of morphology is expected to result in inefficient exciton separation and lacks the bicontinuous interpenetrating pathways necessary for the charge transport, in agreement with the relatively low OPV performance.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized two easily accessible conjugated polymers (PBDTFQ-T and PBDTFQ-TT) consisting of benzodithiophene electron-rich and fluorinated quinoxaline electron-poor units spaced with either thiophene or thieno[3,2-b]thiophene π-bridges, respectively. The presence of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as the π-bridge makes the corresponding polymer backbone more planar and linear compared to the analogue polymer with the thiophene π-bridge. This leads PBDTFQ-TT to have a lower optical gap, a red-shifted absorption and a higher tendency to form π-aggregates compared to PBDTFQ-T. On the other hand, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene imparts less solubility to the corresponding monomer and oligomers, thereby limiting significantly the maximum molar mass obtainable for the resulting polymer, as compared to the analogous polymer with thiophene as the π-bridge. A first comparison between the electrical and photovoltaic properties of the two synthesized polymers, blended with PC61BM as the acceptor and processed under the same experimental conditions with doctor-blading (without using solvent additives), reveals an improved performance of the polymer with the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as the π-bridge (with a PCE of 5.29% on average and 5.60% at maximum) compared to the thiophene π-bridged analogue (with an average PCE of 2.18%). This can be ascribed to enhanced light absorption, charge mobility and improved blend film nanomorphology, despite the lower molar mass. Nevertheless, by tuning the processing conditions through the addition of a solvent additive (DIO) to the PBDTFQ-T based blend, it was possible to improve the blend film nanostructuring, charge transport properties and light absorption, and finally obtain comparable efficiencies (average PCE around 5.30% and 5.68% for the best device) for the devices prepared with the two polymers. However, the facile method for obtaining highly performing polymers by simply varying the π–spacer in donor–acceptor structures and obtaining efficient BHJ solar cells without the need for any additional processing solvent additive suggests the importance of a further and deeper investigation on the use of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene or similar π-bridges inserted in other polymeric structures with different donor and acceptor units.
