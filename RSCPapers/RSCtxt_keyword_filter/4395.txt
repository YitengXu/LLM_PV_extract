    , Accepted 11th March 2013First published on 13th March 2013Abstract2′-Hydroxychalcone derivatives featuring a triphenylamine terminal unit were synthesized in one step and behaved as effective ligands for borondifluoride coordination, enabling the straightforward generation of D–A molecules with strong absorption. Solution-processed solar cells based on these complexes and PC61BM showed a PCE of 1.13%.
Small molecules are receiving a tremendous amount of interest as alternatives to polymers for the generation of bulk heterojunction photovoltaic solar cells.1,2 Discrete molecular semiconductors have well-defined chemical structures and their synthesis is well reproducible. They can be either vacuum deposited3 or solution processed,4 offering thin films with long-range order and high charge carrier mobility. Generally, low band gap materials based on electron donor (D) and acceptor (A) moieties display improved light-harvesting property, red-shifted absorption, and high open-circuit voltage, resulting in high values of the power conversion efficiency (PCE).1,4–6 Solution-processed solar cells based on small molecules containing D and A groups connected to a π-conjugated molecular backbone were shown to reach up to over 7% efficiency.4a,5b,7 Despite the huge amount of small molecular structures published over the last five years,1 there is still a critical need for the design of such semiconductors in order to further explore structure–property correlations and overcome the technological barriers that concern large-area device efficiency, processability, and cost-effective materials and device mass production.
Recently, some of us reported a family of organic dyes based on borondifluoride complexes of 2′-hydroxychalcone derivatives in which the terminal aromatic part of the arylpropenone backbone plays the role of the electron donor group, while the difluorodioxaborine ring acts as a good electron acceptor.8 Compounds that specifically contain a triphenylamine (TPA) unit as a donor end-unit were shown to exhibit an intense and broad absorption band that extended from UV to the far-red end of the visible spectrum.8 We present herein preliminary results obtained for molecules 1–3 (Scheme 1) that illustrate the potentialities of this family of dyes as donor materials in organic solar cells blended with [6,6]phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) as an electron accepting material. Compared to a number of D–A structures reported in the literature,1,3–7 and especially those based on BF2 complexes,9 such as BODIPY derivatives,10 it is remarkable that the chalcone–BF2 species can be obtained straightforwardly involving cheap starting materials in a very simple two-step synthetic route.
 Scheme 1  Molecular structure of dyes 1–3. 
Dye 3 has been reported previously,8 while the new dyes 1 and 2 served to evaluate the effect of substitution at the phenyl ring bearing the dioxaborine chelate. The boron difluoride complexes were obtained as deep-blue solids in two synthetic steps (see Table of content graphic) from commercially available cheap starting materials, following a previously published procedure.8 They were characterized using 1H-, 13C- and 19F-NMR spectroscopies, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis (see Section 2 in ESI†). The introduction of the TPA unit endowed the three compounds with both good solubility in organic solvents and increased chemical stability vs. hydrolytic boron decomplexation.8,11 Compound 2, however, lacking a side group on the phenolate part, was found to be less soluble as compared to the two other analogues. Solutions prepared from carefully dried solvents exhibited no changes in optical properties over a period of several weeks, which allowed performing easily spectroscopic measurements and fabrication of solution-deposited thin films.
The electronic absorption spectra (Fig. 1 and Table 1) of the three dyes in DCM solution display an intense transition band in the visible region with a very high molar absorption coefficient (i.e. 70000 M−1 cm−1). This band is attributed to a π–π* transition with high intramolecular charge transfer character.8 The substituent on the acetophenone ring exerts a significant bathochromic shift Δδ = +15 and +30 nm for 1 and 3, respectively, relative to 2 in DCM. The three dyes drop-cast from DCM display good film forming properties, giving glass-like, dark blue deposits. Compared to the solution, the lowest-energy transition band is red-shifted (up to +36 nm for 2) and shows some broadening (Table 1). Optical band gap values (Eg) between 1.5 and 1.8 eV were evaluated from the onset of the long wavelength absorption edge of the film. The cyclic voltammograms of 2 and 3 in DCM (Table 1 and Fig. S1 in ESI†) show two reversible one-electron oxidation processes with anodic peak potentials Epa1 of ca. 0.5–0.6 V and Epa2 of around 0.80–0.90 V (vs. ferrocene/ferricinium), assigned to the formation of the cation radical and dication, respectively. The methoxy substituent in dye 1 increases the value of Epa1 to 0.78 V and the second anodic peak is not observed. An ill-defined reduction peak is observed for all compounds with cathodic peak potentials Epc1 between −0.95 and −1.2 V, but the reduction process is irreversible.12 The estimated positions of HOMO and LUMO energy levels (Fig. S2 in ESI†) of dyes 1–3 indicate that these materials have the potential to act as donor materials in organic solar cells when blended with PC61BM. We noticed that the characteristic solid-state emission of these dyes8 was demonstrably quenched by the presence of PC61BM in the film.

Photovoltaic devices were fabricated using a direct architecture composed of the following layers: glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/dye:PC61BM/Al and were investigated in the dark and under AM1.5G illumination set at 100 mW cm−2. The donor–acceptor layer was obtained from mixtures of dyes 1 and 3 (a concentration of 10 mg ml−1) with PC61BM in chlorobenzene (CB) as solvent at a dye/PC61BM weight ratio of 1:4. Dye 2, less soluble in chlorobenzene at this concentration, necessitated the use of a chloroform–CB (50/50 v:v) solvent mixture. The solution of 2 with PC61BM was filtered with a 0.45 μm PTFE filter prior to spin coating in order to remove residual aggregates. Under these conditions, the thickness of the layers was rather large (>150 nm) for the three dyes, which may be a source of charge losses by recombination. Indeed the devices provided rather weak values of the short circuit-current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF), leading to a low PCE (Fig. S3 and Table S1 in ESI†). The open-circuit voltage (Voc) values, while reasonable, are not as expected from the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the dyes. Among the several factors that can severely affect Voc, crystallization/aggregation,13 recombination14 and leakage current15 are important. Indeed, from the I–V curves in the dark (Fig. S3 in ESI†), the devices obtained from the three dyes have almost no rectifying behaviour and display strong leakage currents. The latter effect may stem from non-adapted electrode work function15 and/or the occurrence of pin-holes (shunts) in the active layer.14a
We first tested the influence of the solvent used for thin film deposition of dye 1 that presents the best potentialities relative to the two other compounds. o-Dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) did not significantly change device performances but allowed some rectifying behaviour as noticed in the dark characteristics while a solvent mixture, o-DCB–CHCl3 (50/50 v:v), led to poor performance (Fig. S4 in ESI†). o-DCB was thus selected for the following investigation. The use of three different concentrations, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg ml−1, of dye 1:PC61BM (1:4) in o-DCB led to active layer thicknesses of 43, 92 and 187 nm, respectively. Decreasing the thickness improved charge collection, giving higher values of short-circuit current (+30%) and smaller values of the series resistance (Table S2 in ESI†). However, decreasing the thickness also led to a dramatic decrease in shunt resistance (from 4 to 0.4 kΩ at 187 nm and 43 nm thicknesses, respectively), which is responsible for the drop in Voc. Considerable improvement was achieved by replacing aluminum by calcium, a low work function metal, as cathode material. Fig. 2 and Table 2 show the I–V characteristics of devices under illumination with active layer thicknesses of 187, 92 and 43 nm. The dark I–V characteristics show net rectifying behaviour (Fig. S4 in ESI†) and the series resistance reaches acceptable values (35 Ω at 43 nm thickness, Table S2 in ESI†). Higher values of the shunt resistance were obtained using Ca/Al instead of Al as the top electrode metal and leakage currents were reduced. As a consequence, in contrast to the case of the aluminum, the use of calcium combined with the decrease in the active layer thickness provided significant improvement of both Jsc and Voc.16 Even though decreased, leakage currents are still significant (Fig. S4 in ESI†), which can explain the low FF. The best performance was achieved for a device with a 43 nm thick active layer based on 1 that displayed a PCE value of 1.13% (Jsc = 4.97 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.598 V, FF = 0.38).

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the best-performing device (device 1(c), Table 2) is given in Fig. 3 and compared to the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the active layer. It is interesting to note that between 350 and 620 nm, dye 1 can convert more than 15% of the incident photons into electrons. The EQE spectrum presents three bands centred at 337, 400 and 575 nm. The first band corresponds to the contribution of the PC61BM while the last one is associated with the lowest-energy transition band of compound 1. The fact that an important contribution arises from photons absorbed at 400 nm remains yet unclear.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated the use of coordination of borondifluoride, a strong Lewis acid, to produce very simply D–A molecules with enhanced push–pull character. When combined with the TPA unit, these dyes exhibit strong absorption in the visible spectrum, high oxidation potentials, high stability and good solubility in common organic solvents. Given the extreme simplicity of synthesis of these dyes, involving commercially available cheap chemicals, this work demonstrates that borondifluoride complexes of 2′-hydroxychalcones may be promising donor materials for solution-processed organic solar cell technology. We believe that further optimization of both dye structure and device architecture, including thin film morphology, will greatly improve the performance of devices.
