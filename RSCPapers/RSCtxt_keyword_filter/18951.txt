    , Accepted 9th August 2017First published on 9th August 2017AbstractMorphology and crystallinity of perovskite layers are crucial for power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, we introduced amorphous polymer polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) with a CO functional group into a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite precursor to tune the morphology and crystallinity of perovskite layers during the film formation process. The spreading amorphous polymer chains and excellent hygroscopicity of PVP can help the perovskite precursor have better contact with the substrate, leading to better perovskite film coverage. More importantly, the electron pair existing in the oxygen atom of the CO bond in PVP has a strong attraction to Pb(II) ions, which can adjust the location of the nuclei and make the nuclei distribute uniformly in PVP chains, contributing to a uniform and compact perovskite layer. As a result, perovskite films with PVP present favourable morphology and improved crystallinity. The performance of a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx-based perovskite solar cell with optimized PVP content achieves a summit PCE of 16.57% with photovoltage VOC of 1057 mV, short circuit current density JSC of 21.38 mA cm−2, and fill factor FF of 74.52% under standard AM 1.5 solar light of 100 mW cm−2 intensities, which demonstrates a 23.9% increment compared with a PCE of 13.37% of the original device.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskites as light-harvesting materials for thin film solar cells have been attracting increasing attention owing to their excellent properties such as high absorption coefficient,1,2 high carrier mobility,3 excellent ambipolar charge transport,4 and long carrier diffusion length.5 Morphology and crystallinity of perovskite layers are crucial for PCE of PSCs. Drawbacks in polycrystalline perovskite films, such as pinholes, grain boundaries, and low coverage of the film,6–8 breed increased non-radiative recombination and reduced charge carrier lifetime,9–13 leading to a decreased power conversion efficiency of the solar cells.14 Thus, significant efforts such as solvent selection for perovskite precursors,15 temperature and durations of thermal annealing,16,17 solvent annealing,18,19 and additive introduction20–23 have been used to improve the morphology and crystal structure of perovskite absorbers. Among these, introducing additives into a perovskite layer is the most common way for a simple and easy operating method. In addition to small molecule additives such as HI, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), polymer additives can also be another choice. For example, Song et al. enhanced the crystallinity and surface coverage of perovskite thin films by incorporating polyethylenimine (PEI) into CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite precursor and achieved a 26% increment in efficiency.24 Su et al. reported a smooth and complete coverage of perovskite film by incorporating poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) into CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite precursor, yielding a 25% improvement of PCE compared with the original devices.25 Miyano et al. introduced the amine-polymer PFN-P1 into a perovskite to promote uniform crystallization of it, improving reproducibility and stability of perovskite solar cells.26 Despite the evident success of applying a polymer additive to improve the quality of the perovskite absorber, further exploration of useful polymer additives is challenging because different kinds of organic linking groups endow polymers with various chemical reactivity.
Different from a crystalline polymer, an amorphous polymer can spread polymer chains to act as a three-dimensional skeleton to support the growth of perovskite crystals, causing it to cover the substrate more uniformly. As one of the amorphous polymers, PVP is also water soluble. Therefore, excellent hygroscopicity is in favor of improving the wetting properties of a precursor solution, improving film morphology as well.27 What's more, the electron pair existing in the oxygen atom of the CO bond in PVP has a strong attraction to Pb(II) halides, which is beneficial to adjusting the location of the nuclei, and making the nuclei distribute uniformly in PVP chains, thus contributing to a uniform and compact perovskite layer. Hence, in this work, we introduced polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) into the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite precursor to tune the morphology and the crystallinity of perovskite layers during the film formation process. A little pin hole decreased grain boundaries and dense perovskite film was formed; this was proved by scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis. Additionally, X-ray diffraction (XRD), photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) demonstrated that a moderate amount of PVP can effectively enhance crystallinity and decrease the crystal defects of perovskites. As a result, the performance of a CH3NH3PbI3−xClx-based device with 0.3 mg mL−1 of PVP achieved a summit PCE of 16.57%, which demonstrated a 23.9% increase compared with the PCE of 13.37% of the original device.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the preparation process of perovskite solar cells employed in this study, and detailed information is presented in Experimental details. To investigate effects of the PVP additive on the performance of perovskite solar cells, 0 mg mL−1, 0.06 mg mL−1, 0.3 mg mL−1, and 2.4 mg mL−1 PVP/DMF solution was added to perovskite precursor solutions to form the according perovskite–PVP solutions. Then, a perovskite–PVP solution was spin-coated on the FTO/c-TiO2 substrates to form a precursor film. The spreading polymer chains and excellent hygroscopicity of PVP helps the perovskite precursor to spread out smoothly, leading to a good precursor film. And the next annealing treatment of the precursor film helped precursor ions diffuse and form nuclei when the solvent evaporated. More importantly, the electron pair existing in the oxygen atom of the CO bond in PVP has a strong attraction to Pb(II) ions, which is demonstrated by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra in Fig. 2. The shift of the CO vibration from 1716 cm−1 in PVP to 1639 cm−1 in PVP-treated perovskite reveals that the polymer exists in perovskite film and has an interaction with it due to the attraction of CO bond in PVP and Pb(II) ions in perovskite. This attraction can adjust the location of the nuclei and make them distribute uniformly in PVP chains, which is favorable for forming a uniform and compact perovskite layer.

Fig. 3 presents SEM images of the perovskite film with different concentrations (mg mL−1) of PVP. Concerning pristine perovskite film, there are many quite small crystals randomly stacked and interweaved, rending a fairly rough surface and non-uniform thickness. And there are also plenty of pin holes in the film, which can fill with hole conductor material leading to charging a combination and weak light absorption. However, with the addition of PVP in perovskite film, few pin holes can be observed, and the perovskite grain size is increased. What is more, the perovskite crystals are orderly arranged, promoting a smooth perovskite film and uniform thickness. As we can see, the champion perovskite thin-film was achieved when 0.3 mg mL−1 PVP was added. However, with increased content of PVP up to 2.4 mg mL−1, the film exposed large areas of bare TiO2 nanoparticles, which may increase the risk of short circuits.

XRD measurements (Fig. 4(a)) were used for studying crystalline properties of perovskite films with different concentrations of PVP. We observed that there was no obvious difference in diffraction peaks positions. The peaks at 14.2° and 28.5° correspond to the (110) and (220) planes respectively.28 However, the intensity of both diffraction peaks of the perovskite films with PVP is improved compared with the original sample, which indicates that the degree of crystallinity of perovskite has been improved by PVP. This result is consistent with the SEM measurements.

We further elucidated the light absorbance of perovskite films with different concentrations of PVP by UV-vis spectroscopy in Fig. 4(b). As the content of PVP increased, the light absorbance of perovskite films was enhanced in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm, while the absorbance slightly slipped when the content of PVP increased to 2.4 mg mL−1. This increased light absorbance is attributed to more favourable morphology and improved crystallinity of the perovskite layer because the thickness of all modified films ranged from 300–340 nm, which had little impact on the light absorption. When the content of PVP increased to 2.4 mg mL−1, the perovskite film exhibited a large area of bare TiO2 nanoparticles, which is not good for light absorbance of these films.
Steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) of FTO/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films was adopted to check whether excess crystal defects inside the perovskite films could be introduced by PVP. As shown in Fig. 4(b), PL quenching first accelerated and reached the maximum value when 0.3 mg mL−1 PVP was added, then decreased with the content of the polymer. These results implied that photo-generated carriers were extracted quickly when low content polymers were added; this is because the quality of the perovskite film was significantly improved by addition of PVP due to excellent crystallinity and decreased defects. When more content of PVP was added, the coverage of the perovskite films decreased, and more defect states resulted in significant slow PL quenching.
To derive charge transfer and recombination behavior of different perovskite films, we measured time resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy of glass/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films (Fig. 5(a)) and FTO/CH3NH3PbI3−xClx films (Fig. 5(b)). For the glass/perovskite samples, the τave of perovskite film (Table 1) first increased and then decreased with an increase of the polymer content. The maximum τave = 211.43 ns was obtained when 0.3 mg mL−1 PVP was added, compared to the 184.19 ns average PL decay time of the original perovskite film. The relatively low PL quenching in the glass/polymer treated perovskite films implies that trap controlled non-radiative recombination was slower in the polymer-treated perovskite film. This suppressed non-radiative recombination should entail an increase in VOC and the VOC of the perovskite solar cell treated with polymer was 1057 mV larger than that of the reference with 1002 mV. For the FTO/perovskite sample, the τave of perovskite film went the other way compared with glass/perovskite samples. The minimized τave = 27.55 ns was obtained when 0.3 mg mL−1 PVP was added, compared to the 40.25 ns average PL decay time of the original perovskite film. The relatively fast PL quenching in the FTO/polymer-treated perovskite films means that charge transfer and injection from polymer-treated perovskite to electrode is more efficient than in original perovskite films, leading to an improved charge injection/separation efficiency (ηint) and thereby an enhanced short circuit current density (JSC). Additionally, the JSC of the perovskite solar cell treated with polymer was 21.38 mA cm−2 larger than that of the reference 1894 mA cm−2.

Device performance of the perovskite films with various concentrations of PVP are shown in Fig. 6(a–e) and the performance parameters are listed in Table 2. The device based on untreated perovskite film yielded a PCE of 13.37% with VOC of 1002 mV, JSC of 18.94 mA cm−2, and FF of 70.46%. Device performances, in general, are improved with added concentrations of PVP. When 0.06 mg mL−1 PVP was added, JSC, VOC, FF and PCE of the resulting device was increased to 20.15 mA cm−2, 1038 mV, 72.07%, and 15.08%, respectively. The best performance of the devices was obtained when 0.3 mg mL−1 PVP was added, and the resulting PCE was 16.57% with VOC of 1057 mV, JSC of 21.38 mA cm−2, and FF of 74.52%. When the perovskite was treated with 2.4 mg mL−1 PVP, then VOC, JSC, FF, and PCE of the according device was decreased to 898.0 mV, 17.01 mA cm−2, 68.68%, and 8.24%, respectively. The improved performances for devices with 0.3 mg mL−1 PVP addictive could be attributed to improved qualities of the perovskite film such as improved crystallinity and improved morphology. This significantly improved crystallinity and morphology can effectively improve light absorbance of perovskite films and charge carrier transport. And those phenomena are subsequently critical to efficient perovskite solar cells. The decreased performances for devices with 2.4 mg mL−1 PVP addictive resulted from low coverage of the perovskite.

In addition to UV-vis spectroscopy, we also examined incident photo to current conversion efficiency (IPCE), which specifies the ratio of extracted electrons to incident photons at a given wavelength and is directly related to the JSC. The IPCE spectra (Fig. 6f) for perovskite solar cells with different concentrations of PVP were recorded and, as can be seen, when the content of PVP increased then photocurrent density was efficiently enhanced over the whole visible region between 400 and 800 nm. When the content of PVP increased to 2.4 mg mL−1, the photocurrent density had a little drop. This phenomenon exists in UV-vis spectroscopy and I–V characterization. As is known, light harvesting efficiency (ηlh), charge injection/transfer efficiency (ηint), and charge collection efficiency (ηcc) together influence IPCE.29 Note that ηlh, ηint, and ηcc all had certain increases when small amounts of PVP were added; this can be demonstrated in the measurements of UV-vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (shown in Fig. 7), respectively. Thus, the current density mentioned above had a significantly improvement.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured to monitor interfacial contact changes of the perovskite solar cells. Nyquist plots (Fig. 7a) of the devices were measured at −0.90 V in a frequency range from 1 MHz to 100 mHz in the dark. The equivalent circuit composed of series resistance (RS), recombination resistance (Rrec) associated with main semicircle in the low frequency range, and contact resistance (RCO) related to main semicircle in the high frequency range is shown in Fig. 7b.30RCO is related to the contact resistance at TiO2–perovskite and perovskite–HTM interface. Table 3 lists the related parameters of the equivalent circuit. As shown in Fig. 7a, the arc in the low frequency range first increased and reached the maximum value when 0.3 mg mL−1 PVP was added, then decreased with the content of the polymer. The RCO of the device with polymer additive decreased to 85.54 Ω, lower than the resistance 143.57 Ω obtained from the original sample, revealing improved charge injection/separation efficiency (ηint), which is in agreement with the TRPL measurements. The Rrec of the device with polymer additive increased to 1310.41 Ω, much larger than that of the original device (347.25 Ω). This result means that the charge recombination was effectively suppressed. The electron recombination lifetime (Fig. 7b) of the devices with and without polymer additive under bias voltages ranging from 0.2–0.95 V were calculated with the formula:31τrec = (2πf)−1. Compared to the original device, the polymer modified sample shows significantly higher τrec under all the bias voltages applied. This result strongly supports the conclusion that high-quality perovskite film suppresses charge recombination and prolongs the electron lifetime, which is proved in the measurements of time resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy as well.

3. Conclusions
In this study, we employed a hydrophobic amorphous polymer PVP with a CO functional group to tune the crystal-growth of CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite thin films. We found performance of the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx-based device with 0.3 mg mL−1 of PVP achieved a summit PCE of 16.57%, which demonstrated a 23.9% increase compared with a PCE of 13.37% of the control device. This performance increase can be attributed to improved morphology and crystallinity, as reflected by SEM and XRD results. The insight investigations of PL and EIS study further confirm that, with the improved morphology and crystallinity, charge transportation and extraction was greatly enhanced. These results demonstrated that PVP is an effective additive to improve the quality of perovskite films and has a great potential to be a new candidate as an easy-accessible additive for massive production of PSCs.
Experimental details
FTO coated glass substrates (Pilkington, thickness: 2.2 mm, sheet resistance 14 Ω square−1) were etched with HCl and zinc powder, before being ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, deionized water, isopropyl alcohol and ethanol, successively. After that, the substrates were further treated with ultraviolet ozone for 15 min. A 40 nm thick TiO2 compact layer was then deposited on the substrates by spin-coating using a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) sol gel solution, at 4000 rpm, for 30 s. After the spin coating, the substrates were immediately dried at 120 °C for 10 min, and then gradually heated to 450 °C for 30 min and cooled to room temperature. Then the substrates were treated in a 0.04 M aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C, rinsed with deionized water, and dried at 120 °C for 10 min. After that, they were heated to 500 °C for 30 min, and taken to a glovebox for cooling to room temperature. To deposit the perovskite layer, a 1:3 ratio of PbCl2/CH3NH3I was mixed in DMF and stirred to form a perovskite precursor solution. Then 0 mg mL−1, 0.06 mg mL−1, 0.03 mg mL−1, and 2.4 mg mL−1 PVP/DMF solution were added to the perovskite precursor solution to form the resulting CH3NH3PbI3−xClx–PVP solutions. Then, 120 μL CH3NH3PbI3−xClx–PVP solution was spin-coated on the FTO/c-TiO2 substrates at 2800 rpm for 30 s followed by treating the film with a multi-step slow annealing method. A hole transport layer solution composed of 1 mL Spiro-MeOTAD/chlorobenzene (72.3 mg mL−1), 17.5 μL Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (520 mg mL−1), and 28 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s when perovskite thin films grew well. Lastly, a 90 nm thick silver layer was thermally evaporated onto the device.
Measurements
SEM images were collected by a HitachiSU-70 scanning electron microscope (SEM). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired with a Bruker AXSD8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54050 Å). UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained using a VARIAN Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Steady-state photo-luminescence spectroscopy (PL) measurements were measured using an Edinburgh Instruments FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer with an excitation wavelength of 460 nm. Time-resolved PL were conducted on F13-111 and the spectra were acquired by monitoring the signal at 750 nm excited with a 450 nm laser at room temperature. Current density–voltage measurements were conducted under simulated AM1.5G sunlight of 100 mW cm−2 using an AM1.5G type filter (Newport, 81904, USA). The light intensity was adjusted by a standard Si solar cell. The effective area of the cell was defined to be 0.07 cm2 using a nonreflective metal mask. J–V curves were recorded with a Keithley model 4200 digital source meter at room temperature in ambient air. The incident photo-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum was measured by a IPCE system (Newport 2936-cpowermeter) in a 300–800 nm wavelength range under radiation of a 300 W xenon light source with an Oriel Corner stone monochromator in DC mode at room temperature. Electrical impedance spectra (EIS) of the devices were characterized using an electrochemical workstation (Zennium, Germany) with the measured frequency range from 1 MHz to 100 mHz in dark conditions.
