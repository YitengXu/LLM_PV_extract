    , Accepted 17th February 2022First published on 18th February 2022AbstractIn order to improve the power conversion efficiency of single junction polymer solar cells (PSCs), we have used a ternary blend consisting of a low bandgap D–A conjugated polymer P and two acceptors, i.e., one nonfullerene, Cz-IC, and one fullerene, PC71BM. The concept of a ternary bulk heterojunction (BHJ) using these two acceptors takes advantage of the high electron mobility of the fullerene, which is beneficial for charge transport. The absorption spectra of PC71BM, Cz-IC and P are complementary to each other, resulting in an increase in the light harvesting ability of the ternary BHJ active layer. The PSC based on an optimized ternary BHJ active layer achieved a PCE of 15.27%, which is higher than those of both binary PSCs based on P:PC71BM and P:Cz-IC. The increase in JSC and FF values for the ternary PSC with respect to the P:Cz-IC binary counterpart may be attributed to the better and balanced charge transport properties owing to the high electron mobility of PC71BM. The incorporation of PC71BM into the P:Cz-IC blend also increases the hole transfer efficiency from both acceptors to P, thus reducing the charge recombination, resulting in a boost of the fill factor and the overall PCE of the ternary OSC.
Introduction
Over the last few years, particularly after 2015, with the aim of high efficiency bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ-PSCs), the design of nonfullerene small molecule acceptors (NFSMAs)1–8 as alternative electron acceptors in BHJ-PSC has been the subject of intense investigation. Indeed, using NFSMAs, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been increased to the range of 17–18% for single junction-based PSCs.9–15 It was already predicted that PSCs exhibiting PCEs up to 20% could be achieved with high stability when appropriate polymer donors and NFSMAs were used in the BHJ active layer of PSCs16,17 and could possibly be candidates for future eco-friendly commercial applications.18–22
Although remarkable PCEs have been achieved for binary BHJ-PSCs, the photon harvesting properties of these devices are limited since most organic semiconducting materials generally exhibit relatively narrow absorption profiles with a full-width-at-half-maximum of less than 150 nm, which restrict further improvements of the PCEs of these devices. To improve the photon harvesting ability of the active layer as much as possible, the concept of ternary PSCs has been established by combining either two electron donors and one acceptor or two electron acceptors and one donor with complementary absorption profiles into a single BHJ active layer.23–27 The addition of a third component either as an electron donor or an acceptor in the active layer may provide sufficient photon harvesting ability, modulate the degree of phase separation and molecular arrangement, and may also form cascade energy levels for either energy or charge transfer which is generally known to boost the PCEs of ternary PSCs in the range of 17–18%.28–35 Moreover, the ternary approach adopting the layer-by-layer deposition technique has also been employed to improve the overall PCE of PSCs.36 Upon evolution of BHJ-PSC designs, the combination of a fullerene acceptor and a nonfullerene acceptor leads to ternary systems, and altogether has led to higher PCEs owing to the high electron mobility of the fullerene derivatives compared to that of NFSMAs.37–39 This beneficial situation stems from a favorable morphology manipulation.40,41
NFSMAs are generally built upon a push–pull A–D–A motif and more rarely A–D, where A and D are electron withdrawing and donating groups, respectively. Among the donating group, carbazole-containing residues have attracted significant attention.42–56 Over the past two years, the molecular design of carbazole-based NFSMAs has evolved and several examples are presented in Fig. 1 along with the reported PCEs of their BHJ-PSCs (optimized values). The most employed electron withdrawing groups are malononitrile derivatives, notably those containing extra electron withdrawing heteroatoms such as fluorides. Overall, there is a sensitive increase in PCEs upon incorporating these atoms.
 Fig. 1  Selected structures of recently reported carbazole-based NFSMAs along with their PCEs of their BHJ-PSCs (optimized values): DTCC-4Cl + DTSiC-4Cl (i.e. the best PCE),48 DTCCIC-4F,49 DTCCIC,49 DTCC-BC,50 DTCC-IC,50 H2FCN-C16,51 ICz-Rd2,52,53 ICz-RdCN2,53 and SMDPP.54 This selection is based on the best ones where the carbazole residue is employed as a sub-fragment of the nonfullerene acceptor. 
The simplest push–pull carbazole-containing dyads and triad are the mono- (1–3) and bis(malononitrile)carbazoles (Cz-IC) and their optical and electrochemical properties are known (Fig. 2).56–60 Moreover, compounds 1 and 3 have been tested in organic solar cells of the structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/MoOx (15 nm)/1′ or 3 (15 or 30 nm)/C60 (50 nm)/bathocuproine (BCP, 6 nm)/Al (100 nm).59 Concurrently, compound 2 has been tested in a dye sensitized solar cell using a NiO electrode.60 However, the resulting PCEs were found to be very modest (0.01 < PCE < 1.61%).
 Fig. 2  Structures of 1–3 and Cz-IC. 
We now report the photovoltaic properties of an ADA material denoted as Cz-IC employed as a NFSMA in ternary solar cells, where PC71BM is used as a second electron acceptor. The low bandgap D–A conjugated polymer P composed of a 2,8-dibisthiophene-benzotrithiopne donor (D) unit and a fluorinated benzothiadiazole acceptor (A), linked via a thiophene linker,61 is also incorporated inside the active layer of BHJ-PSCs in this investigation. The best PCE is found to be higher than 15.27%, which can be considered highly efficient, i.e. a record, even though no electron withdrawing atoms, such as fluorine, are introduced onto the skeleton of molononitrile-containing groups. Because Cz-IC can be prepared in only four steps from commercial starting materials, instead of about 10 steps generally encountered in NFSMAs presented in Fig. 1, this carbazole-based ADA triad can be considered to be rather inexpensive.

Results and discussion

Fig. 3a and b show the chemical structures and absorption spectra of P, Cz-IC and PC71BM, respectively. The P donor absorbs between 550 and 900 nm, while the Cz-IC acceptor shows complementary absorption bands situated between 400 and 650 nm. PC71BM also absorbs light below 600 nm, where both P and Cz-IC exhibit weaker absorption features. Moreover, PC71BM exhibits high electron mobility and can be considered as an electron transport medium.

In BHJ-PSCs, after exciton dissociation, the electron transfer (ET) from the donor to the acceptor and the hole transfer (HT) from the acceptor to the donor are critical factors determining the overall PCE. The efficiencies of ET and HT are decided by both the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy offsets between the donor and the acceptor, respectively. Their energy level diagrams of the materials are shown in Fig. 3c. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are −5.12/−3.52 eV for P, −5.98/−3.77 eV for Cz-IC and −6.10/4.10 eV for PC71BM. It can be seen from Fig. 3c that the HOMO offset between P and Cz-IC is high enough over the threshold value needed for exciton dissociation and the subsequent hole transfer from the HOMO of Cz-IC to the HOMO of P. The LUMO offset between P and Cz-IC is about 0.25 eV, which is low enough for the efficient electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor used in the BHJ active layer of PSCs. To obtain information on the electron transfer from P to Cz-IC, the steady state photoluminescence spectra (PL) of the thin films for the pristine P and P:Cz-IC blend excited at a wavelength near to the absorption peak of P have been recorded (Fig. 4). The PL intensity of the pristine P is significantly quenched by Cz-IC in the P:Cz-IC blend film. This PL quenching demonstrates the presence of an efficient photo-induced electron transfer from P to Cz-IC despite the modest LUMO offset between P and Cz-IC. Such a situation has already been reported in the literature for nonfullerene acceptor based BHJ-PSCs.62

Single junction binary OSCs based on the P donor and Cz-IC or PC71BM as the acceptor were constructed using conventional indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/PFN/Al configuration. We have optimized the photovoltaic performance by varying the weight ratio between the donor P and acceptors (PC71BM or Cz-IC) using chloroform as a processing solvent and found that the optimized ratios are 1:1.2 and 1:1.4 for P:Cz-IC and P:PC71BM BHJ active layers, respectively (the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1a and b, ESI†). The optimized weight ratio active layers were subjected to solvent annealing for 40 s in THF vapor to further improve the photovoltaic performance. The total concentration for both active layers was 16 mg mL−1. The fabrication details and procedures are described in the ESI.† The current–voltage (J–V) plots of the optimized OSCs under illumination (AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) are displayed in Fig. 5a and the related photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The optimized OSCs based on P:PC71BM and P:Cz-IC showed PCEs of 8.99% (a VOC of 0.74 V, a JSC of 17.88 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.68) and 11.86% (a VOC of 0.98 V, a JSC of 19.52 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.62), respectively. The higher value of VOC for Cz-IC-based OSCs compared to that of the PC71BM counterpart may be associated with the relatively upshifted LUMO energy level of Cz-IC as compared to PC71BM since the VOC in the BHJ-OSC is directly related to the energy offset between the LUMO of the acceptor and HOMO of the donor.63 The JSC value for the P:Cz-IC-based PSC may be attributed to the broader absorption profile of P:Cz-IC as compared to that for P:PC71BM since JSC is linked to the light harvesting properties of the BHJ active layer. The FF value of the P:PC71BM-based PSC is higher than that of the P:Cz-IC-based counterpart, which may be associated with the superior electron mobility of fullerenes as compared to that of non-fullerene acceptors.64

Considering the advantage of the high JSC and VOC values for binary P:Cz-IC-based PSCs, the high value of FF for the P:PC71BM counterpart, and the complementary absorption spectra of PC71BM and Cz-IC, the ternary BHJ-OSCs using P as the electron donor and PC71BM and Cz-IC as acceptors have been fabricated. The photovoltaic performance of the ternary PSCs was optimized by varying the weight ratio between the two acceptors and kept the amount of the donor P constant. The P:PC71BM/Cz-IC (1:0.2:1.0) PSC processed using the CF solvent (total concentration of 16 mg mL−1) showed the best photovoltaic performance (details are summarized in Table S2, ESI†). The P:PC71BM/Cz-IC active layer was also subjected to the SVA treatment as similarly performed for the binary active layers. The J–V curves for the optimized ternary PSC are shown in Fig. 5a and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The optimized ternary PSC exhibits a PCE of 15.27% (JSC = 23.38 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.92 V and FF = 0.71), which is superior to that of the binary BHJ-PSCs. The higher value of JSC of the ternary PSC is fully consistent with the fact that the PL intensity of P is more quenched in the P:PC71BM/Cz-IC blend than that of the binary counterparts, indicating that the ET is more efficient in the ternary PSC as compared to the P:Cz-IC binary one.
In order to confirm the effect of the higher JSC value in the ternary PSC as compared to the binary counterparts, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of PSCs was measured (Fig. 5b). The EQE response closely resembles that of the absorption spectra of the corresponding active layers (shown in Fig. S1, ESI†), thus demonstrating that all materials used in the active layers are contributing to the photocurrent generation. The higher EQE values of the ternary PSC for the whole spectrum may be attributed to the fact that the light harvesting efficiency and the more efficient exciton dissociation in the ternary active layer for the ternary based OSC is better compared to that for the binary counterparts.65,66 The JSC spectra of PSCs are also shown in Fig. 5b. The integrated values of JSC are about 17.63, 19.32 and 23.21 mA cm−2 for the optimized P:PC71BM, P:Cz-IC and P:PC71BM/Cz-IC based PSCs, respectively, and are very close to the values observed in the J–V data.
To obtain more information on the improvement in FF in the ternary PSCs, we have estimated the values of series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) for binary and ternary devices. The Rs values are about 2.46, 3.15 and 1.89 Ω cm2 for P:PC71BM, P:Cz-IC and P:PC71BM:Cz-IC based devices, respectively. Since the Rs of the device is associated with the charge transport in the active layer towards electrodes, the observed trends in the Rs in these devices are fully consistent with the observed value of FF. The Rsh values are about 856, 912, and 987 Ω cm2 for P:PC71BM, P:Cz-IC and P:PC71BM:Cz-IC based devices, respectively, which are consistent with the trends observed in the VOC of the devices.
The VOC value of the ternary PSC (0.92 V) is found to be in between the values observed for P:PC71BM (0.84 V) and P:Cz-IC (0.98 V). This outcome may be attributed to the alloy formation between the two acceptors. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PC71BM/Cz-IC are determined using CV measurements with different weight ratios between these two acceptors and are summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). The values of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the optimized blend are −6.02 and −3.88 eV, respectively. The LUMO energy level of the mixed acceptor ternary system lies between those of PC71BM and Cz-IC, which is consistent with the higher VOC value found for binary PSCs based on P:PC71BM and the lower VOC value observed for the P:Cz-IC counterpart. In conclusion, the two acceptors, PC71BM and Cz-IC, form an alloy in the ternary BHJ active layer as reported in the literature.67,68
The photocurrent and FF values of the PSCs are known to depend on the exciton generation rate and their subsequent dissociation into free charge carriers and charge transports as well as their collection at their respective electrodes, i.e. holes at the anode and electrons at the cathode. In order to obtain information about the exciton generation rate (Gmax), exciton dissociation rate and charge collection rate, the variation of the photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of the effective voltage (Veff) for these optimized PSCs has been examined69,70 (Fig. 6). Jph is described as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively. Veff is expressed as Veff = Vo − V, where Vo is the voltage at which JL = JD, and V is the applied voltage. After an initial increase in Jph with the increase in Veff, Jph tends to saturate and finally reaches the saturation current (Jsat) at Veff > 1.2 V for all the investigated devices. The trend for Jph follows this order: P:PC71BM/Cz-IC > P:Cz-IC > P:PC71BM. The exciton dissociation (Pdiss) and charge collection probability (Pcoll) were estimated from Jph/Jsat under short circuit and maximum power point conditions, respectively, and are summarized in Table 2. Both Pdiss and Pcoll values are higher for the ternary PSC as compared to the binary counterparts, indicating that the exciton dissociation and charge collection are superior for the ternary PSC as compared to the binary counterparts. The Gmax value is also estimated using the expression Jmax = Jsat/qL, where L is the thickness of the active layer and q is the elementary charge. The Gmax values for the PSCs are summarized in Table 2. The Gmax value of the ternary PSC is higher than that of the binary counterparts, demonstrating that the light harvesting efficiency of the ternary BHJ is better than that of the binary counterparts. This conclusion is validated by the EQE spectra of the binary and ternary PSCs. The JSC value of the ternary OSCs is higher than that of the binary counterparts.

In order to provide understanding on the charge transport in the binary and ternary devices, the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities have been measured from the dark J–V characteristics of hole only and electron only devices, respectively, and fitting the data using a space charge limited current (SCLC) model (Fig. 7). The data are summarized in Table 2. The μh and μe values of the P:Cz-IC blend film are 3.46 × 10−4 and 1.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with the corresponding μh/μe ratio of 2.51. When PC71BM is incorporated into the P:Cz-IC blend as a third component with a weight ratio of 1:0.3:0.9 (i.e.P: PC71BM/Cz-IC), the μh and μe values increase up to 3.6 × 10−4 and 2.95 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, resulting in a corresponding μh/μe ratio of 1.24. The increase in the μh value for the ternary device may be attributed to the increased crystallinity and dense π–π stacking distance in the ternary active layer. The larger charge carrier mobilities and more balanced μh/μe ratio for the ternary blend film may be attributed to the larger electron mobility of the PC71BM phase, thus contributing to the superior values of both FF and JSC, which ultimately resulted in an improvement in the overall PCE of the ternary OSC.

The bimolecular charge recombination process in the PSCs was investigated by the analysis of JSCvs. Pin (Fig. 8a). The dependence of JSC with Pin follows the power law as described by JSC ∝ (Pin)α, where α is an exponential factor, which provides information on the degree of bimolecular recombination.71,72 The α values estimated from Fig. 8a are 0.931, 0.945 and 0.974 for P:Cz-IC, P:PC71BM and P:PC71BM/Cz-IC, respectively. The α value is higher and closer to unity for the ternary OSCs, indicating that the bimolecular recombination is reduced by the incorporation of PC71BM in the P:Cz-IC binary blend. The variation of VOC with Pin is shown in Fig. 8b and the dependence follows the expression VOC ∝ n(KT/q) ln (Pin), where K, T and q are the Boltzmann's constant, absolute temperature, and elementary charge, respectively. In general, the ‘n’ value lies in between 1 and 2. When ‘n’ is close to 1, the losses of charges are due to the bimolecular recombination, whereas when n is close to 2, the charge loss is due to the trap-assisted recombination. The fitted n values for P:PC71BM binary, P:Cz-IC binary and P:PC71BM/Cz-IC ternary OSCs are 1.26, 1.32 and 1.15, respectively. The lowest ‘n’ value for the ternary OSC indicates that the trap-assisted recombination is also reduced in the ternary active layer.

In order to obtain information about the charge transfer between the two acceptors, the J–V characteristics of the devices under illumination using the pristine PC71BM, Cz-IC and optimized Cz-IC:PC71BM blend as the active layer have been measured and the data are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The JSC value of the device based on Cz-IC:PC71BM is about 3.86 mA cm−2, which is higher than that of either PC71BM (0.98 mA cm−2) or Cz-IC (1.78 mA cm−2), indicating that there is a photo-induced charge transfer between two acceptors. The LUMO energy offset (0.35 eV) between PC71BM and Cz-IC is sufficiently higher than that of the driving force needed for the ET from Cz-IC to PC71BM. We assume that the efficient ET is also taking place in the acceptor blend. However, the HOMO energy offset (0.12 eV) is significantly smaller than the threshold value of the driving force needed for the HT from the HOMO of PC71BM to the HOMO of Cz-IC. Therefore, the PL spectra of the pristine PC71BM and its blend with Cz-IC were recorded and are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The PL intensity of PC71BM is quenched in the PC71BM:Cz-IC blend, indicating that there is a HT from PC71BM to Cz-IC. In the PC71BM:Cz-IC BHJ film, PC71BM behaves as the strong acceptor and Cz-IC acts as the weak acceptor, and, after the exciton generation in PC71BM and subsequent dissociation at the PC71BM/Cz-IC interface, the holes are transferred from PC71BM and then P, finally collected by the anode ITO. There is a small spectral overlap between the absorption spectra of Cz-IC and PL spectra of PC71BM (Fig. S4, ESI†), indicating that the singlet–singlet energy transfer from PC71BM to Cz-IC is possible but the charge transfer is the dominant process. The possible electron and hole transfer mechanisms in the ternary BHJ-OSCs are shown in Fig. 9. After generation of photoinduced excitons, the holes from the HOMO of both acceptors are transferred to the HOMO of P and the electrons from the LUMO of P are transferred to both acceptors.73,74 In the ternary active layer, there are P/PC71BM, P/Cz-IC and Cz-IC/PC71BM D/A interfaces that are formed, thus increasing the D/A interfacial area in the ternary BHJ active layer as compared to the binary counter parts. These interfaces lead to improved JSC values for the ternary PSC. Moreover, the PL intensity of P is more quenched in the ternary film (Fig. 4), indicating that excitons are more effectively dissociated into the free charge carrier and their subsequent transfer, i.e., the ET from P to either PC71BM or Cz-IC and the HT from both acceptors to P, leading to the increase in the JSC value for the ternary PSC.

The energy loss (Eloss) in the PSCs is estimated from Eloss = Egopt – qVOC, where Egopt is calculated from the onset of the EQE spectra of the devices.75,76 The values of Eloss are listed in Table 1. The Eloss value for the ternary PSC is higher than that of P:Cz-IC and smaller than that of the P:PC71BM based devices, which is consistent with the values of VOC observed in the PSCs. The increase in the VOC value for the ternary PSC may also be associated with the reduced value of Eloss as compared to the PSC based on P:C71BM and also to the formation of charge transfer (CT) in the Cz-IC:PC71BM blend.
The morphologies of the binary and ternary films were investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The TEM images show the dark and bright regions, which respectively correspond to the acceptor rich and electron rich areas due to their different electron densities. P:Cz-IC and P:PC71BM showed apparent aggregation. The ternary active layer film aggregation is slightly improved, and the domain distribution is more continuous and uniform, which is beneficial for the formation of good interpenetrating network and phase separation for the charge transport,77,78 improving the FF and PCE of ternary PSCs.77,78 The appropriate phase separation between the donor and acceptor resulted in a suppression of charge recombination and resulted in higher FF for the ternary PSC as compared to the binary counterparts.
The effect of the incorporation of PC71BM into P:Cz-IC on the molecular packing crystallinity of the active layer was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in plane geometry, which are shown in Fig. 10. The parameters, i.e. d-spacing, π–π stacking distance and crystal coherence length (CCL) estimated from the XRD patterns, are summarized in Table 3. The binary film exhibits the (100) (2θ = 4.79°) and (010) (2θ = 23.79°) diffraction peaks and corresponds to the lamellar diffraction and π–π stacking, respectively. Since the diffraction peaks of both P and Cz-IC overlap, it is not possible to distinguish their peaks in the binary and ternary blends. Upon the incorporation of PC71BM, the (100) and (010) peaks shift to 5.04° and 24.14°, respectively, and a new weak and broad signal appears at 2θ = 18.23° corresponding to the PC71BM phase. The intensities of both (100) and (010) diffraction peaks for the ternary PSC are stronger than those of the binary counterparts, indicating that molecular ordering and crystallinity have increased with the addition of a small quantity of PC71BM. The CCLs of both lamellar and π–π stacking for the ternary active film are larger than those of the binary counterparts, indicating a preference of face on the molecular packing orientation in the vertical direction which is beneficial for the charge transport in the ternary BHJ active layer as compared to the binary counterparts. Moreover, the π–π stacking distance is shorter in the ternary films than that of the binary counterpart, which is beneficial for the charge transport, which suppresses recombination as observed by the mobility measurements. These observations are fully consistent with the higher FF value for the ternary PSCs as compared to the binary counterpart.

Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge, the simple A–D–A nonfullerene Cz-IC has been used in a PSC for the first time. Indeed, it was used for the fabrication of binary BHJ-PSCs using a narrow bandgap D–A polymer P. It proved to be a better electron acceptor than PC71BM in the binary active layers of the OSCs (i.e.P:Cz-IC and P:PC71BM; PCE = 11.86 and 8.99%, respectively), which showed a high VOC value of 0.98 V with a JSC value of 19.52 mA cm−2. The high value of VOC is attributed to the high lying LUMO of Cz-IC. Taking advantage of the high value of FF of 0.68 for P:PC71BM PSCs and high values of VOC and JSC for P:Cz-IC, we have fabricated ternary PSCs based on P:PC71BM/Cz-IC and, after the optimization, the PSC showed an overall PCE of 15.27% with an energy loss of 0.48 eV. The increase in the PCE for the ternary PSC is mainly due to the increase in JSC and FF and may be attributed to the formation of the cascaded energy level in the ternary active layer, reduced π–π stacking distance and appropriate phase separation for the charge transport and reduced charge recombination. In summary, Cz-IC can be prepared in only four steps, which makes this inexpensive underexploited nonfullerene molecule highly attractive. In the ternary system, P:Cz-IC/PC71BM, the PCE increased to 15.27%, which places this value among the best OSCs, if not the best (Table 1), where the nonfullerene acceptor bears a carbazole sub-unit.
