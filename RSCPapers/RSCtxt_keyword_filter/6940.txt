    , Accepted 27th November 2020First published on 12th December 2020AbstractA series of novel phthalocyanine derivatives with bulky electron-donating thioether substituents were synthesized in order to investigate the effect of sulfur atoms on the solar-cell performances of zinc–phthalocyanine based dye-sensitized solar cells. Incorporation of sulfur atoms onto the phthalocyanine periphery resulted in a red shift of the absorption spectrum. In terms of solar cell performance, using sulfur atoms decreased quantum efficiency probably due to lower injection efficiency caused by the symmetrical electronic structure and lower excited state level.
Introduction
The low cost and easy fabrication processes, lightweight and flexible structure of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) make them promising alternatives to conventional crystalline silicon solar cells.1 Record power conversion efficiencies up to 13–14% have been achieved by using a push–pull type porphyrin sensitizer (SM315)2 and an organic dye (ADEKA-1), respectively.3 However, moderate DSSC conversion efficiency, which is lower than the efficiency of silicon and perovskite solar cells, and the lack of long-term performance stability compared to other solar cells have remained the major challenges in the large scale commercialization of these devices. DSSCs convert sunlight into electrical power by mimicking the natural photosynthesis process in green plants. DSSCs consist of three main components, viz., the photosensitizing dye, nanocrystalline semiconductor, and a redox couple in the electrolyte. Optimization of the process conditions in these parts in order to become more competitive with crystalline silicon-based solar cells still remains an important research topic for current solar cell technology. Obviously, among the DSSC components, the sensitizer is of great importance in determining the performance of the cell. In order to improve the conversion efficiency of DSSCs, an impressive synthetic effort has been carried out in the development of various types of dye sensitizers to ensure optimal photovoltaic parameters such as strong absorption in the red/near IR spectral regions and appropriate energy levels. Among the many photosensitizers, phthalocyanines (Pcs) appear to be a good candidate because of their high chemical and optical stability and versatility.4 In particular, energy levels and absorption abilities of Pcs can be altered largely by the peripheral/axial modifications.5 One of the most intriguing peculiarities of Pc derivatives is their intense absorption in the red/near-infrared (NIR) region of the solar spectrum (600–800 nm, where the solar photon flux is maximum) with very high extinction coefficients.6,7 On the other hand, the considerably large π-delocalized surface and planar aromatic structure of Pcs tends to cause dye aggregation through the occurrence of π–π interaction between the Pc cores, harming electron injection from the excited dye to the conduction band of the semiconductor.8,9 Dye aggregation causes deactivation of the excited dye by intermolecular energy transfers and prevents electron injection from the dye to the electrode resulting in a considerably lower photovoltaic performance.10 Using a co-adsorbent is considered to be the most common method to reduce unfavorable dye aggregation on the metal oxide surface through increasing the distance between the dyes attached to TiO2, thus increasing the photocurrent and thereby the conversion efficiency. However, it reduces the dye coverage on the semiconductor surface which limits the performance of the device, hence a balance of these factors must be considered when optimizing the efficiency of a device. The limitations in the performances of Pcs in DSSCs have prompted the design and synthesis of new phthalocyanines with “push–pull” characteristics and sterically hindered substituents directly attached to the Pc macrocycle. Indeed, a significant breakthrough for the Pc-sensitized DSSCs came with PcS6. An exceptional power conversion efficiency of 4.6% was reported by Mori et al., attributed to the bulky peripheral substituents, namely 2,6-diphenylphenoxy, which not only completely suppresses dye aggregation without using chenodeoxycholic acid as the co-adsorbent, but also does not enhance charge recombination.11 Molecular engineering of Pcs with the push–pull configuration and similar bulky peripheral substituents to ensure molecular orientation and arrangement of sensitizers on the TiO2 surface allowed achieving over 6% efficiencies.12–16
In this work, we designed a series of Pc dyes 1–6 (Fig. 1) by modification of the reference PcS18 (ref. 16) dye in which oxygen atoms in the bulky phenol substituents were replaced by the stronger electron donating sulfur atoms. This series, which is organized in a systematic comparative way, allows us to evaluate not only the effect of the sulfur atom but also the effect of the adsorption site structure and the size of peripheral substituents on the dye sensitized solar cell performance. It is known that sulfur-containing aromatic rings allow alteration of the spectral and electrochemical properties of the sensitizer by decreasing HOMO–LUMO energy band gaps and shifting the absorption to the near-IR region.17–19 As expected, the introduction of bulky thiophenoxy substituents in the peripheral position of ZnPcs decreased the HOMO–LUMO band-gap, shifting the absorption to the near-IR region and maintaining the minimization of aggregation. On the other hand, the sulfur atoms in the dye could interact with the iodine in the electrolyte, which results in a higher recombination and low conversion efficiency. It has been demonstrated that some dyes such as porphyrins and ruthenium complexes having sulfur atoms bind to iodine in the I3−/I− redox electrolyte.20–22 This interaction causes the unwanted charge-recombination in dye sensitized solar cells resulting in Voc reduction and low performance of the devices. In contrast, Robson et al. reported that the replacement of oxygen by sulfur atom within the donor unit of donor–acceptor organic dyes leads to an enhancement of open-circuit voltage due to the rapid rate of dye regeneration.23 These results suggest that rational design of dyes affects the dye regeneration process rather than the recombination process. However, the role of sulfur atom in recombination has not been studied in phthalocyanine derivatives. We therefore prepared a series of Pc derivatives to examine the effect of the sulfur atom on the performances of Pc-based dye sensitized solar cells.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of zinc phthalocyanine derivatives
The details of the preparation of the bulky phthalonitrile derivatives have been described elsewhere.24 ZnPc 1 and 2 bearing bulky thiophenoxy units and a carboxyethynyl group were synthesized according to a literature procedure13 in three steps starting from the corresponding monoiodo Pc derivatives. A conjugated ethynyl spacer was used as the linker between the Pc π-system and the carboxylic anchoring group since Torres et al. demonstrated that ethynyl bridges facilitated electron injection from the LUMO of the dye to the TiO2.13 The synthesis of ZnPc 5 and 6 consisting of phenyl spacers was carried out following previously published procedures.16 ZnPc 3 and 4 in which the carboxylic acid is directly attached to the ZnPc ring were synthesized according to a new procedure which was developed by Torres et al.,25 based on a palladium-catalyzed hydroxycarbonylation reaction of an iodo-ZnPc derivative in one step and in good yields. This procedure allows the use of milder conditions and reducing the reaction steps with a good impurity profile when compared to the classical synthetic procedure which relies on two consecutive oxidation steps of the corresponding hydroxymethyl phthalocyanine13 (see the ESI† for further details).
The UV-Vis spectra of Pcs 1–6 in CHCl3 is shown in Fig. 2. As expected, all novel ZnPc derivatives show intense and sharp Q-bands in CHCl3, indicating that they were in the monomeric form and molecular stacking was prevented by the bulky peripheral substituents. The substitution of one oxygen atom with sulfur atom in the aromatic system resulted in the red-shift of Pcs in the UV-Vis spectrum. The new ZnPcs 1–6 show a maximum absorbance at around 710 nm, thus representing red shifts in the absorption maximum of ca. 30 nm, in comparison to that of Pcs18 (ca. 680 nm).

When mesoporous TiO2 electrodes were immersed into the solution of ZnPc 1–6, the carboxylic acid in ZnPc 1–6 could interact with the TiO2 surface to obtain dye-stained electrodes. While the color of the electrode stained with PcS18 was a vivid green, ZnPc 4-stained electrode shows a yellowish green color (Fig. S7†). The adsorption amounts of dye-stained electrodes using THF solutions of ZnPc 2, 4, and 6 having 2,6-diisopropylphenoxy units were much lower than those of ZnPc 1, 3, and 5 with 2,6-diphenylphenoxy units. This may be due to the high solubilities of these dyes in THF. The adsorption amounts from a toluene solution of ZnPc 2, 4, and 6 were almost comparable to those of electrodes using THF solutions of ZnPc 1, 3, and 5. Moreover, ZnPc 1, 3, and 5 scarcely dissolved in toluene. Therefore, we employed different solvents (THF for ZnPc 1, 3, and 5 and toluene for ZnPc 2, 4, and 6) to obtain dye-stained electrodes. The DSSC performances of ZnPc 1–6 were evaluated using sandwiched cells composed of double-layered TiO2 electrodes stained with ZnPc 1–6, Pt counter electrode, and redox electrolyte (ELA-1: 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M tert-butyl pyridine in acetonitrile) under a standard AM 1.5 solar condition (100 mW cm−2).
The short-circuit photocurrents (Jsc), open-circuit voltages (Voc), fill factors (FF), and solar-to-electronic power conversion efficiencies (PCE) for ZnPc 1–6 cells are summarized in Table 1. And the incident-photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of ZnPc 1–6 and PcS18 are shown in Fig. 3. Among the series of ZnPc 1, 3, and 5 bearing the same peripheral groups, the PCE values and the maximum IPCE values at the Q band were in the order of ZnPc 1 < ZnPc 5 < ZnPc 3. The highest IPCE of the ZnPc 3 cell was probably due to the relatively high charge injection yields caused by the direct attachment of the Pc ring to the anchoring groups. While the adsorption density of ZnPc 3 was lowest in this series due to the steric hindrance around the adsorption site, the ZnPc 3 cell showed the highest PCE value of 4.8%. When the thickness of the TiO2 transparent layer was increased from 7.2 to 12.0 μm, the Jsc values of the ZnPc 3 cell rose from 10.8 to 12.4 mA cm−2, corresponding to a PCE of 5.2% under one sun condition.

 Fig. 3  IPCE spectra of DSSC cells sensitized by (a) 1 (blue), 3 (red), and 5 (green); (b) 2 (blue), 4 (red), 6 (green) and PcS18 (dotted line). 
The other series of ZnPc 2, 4, and 6 having 2,6-isopropyl thiophenoxy peripheral units displayed the PCE order of ZnPc 6 < ZnPc 2 < ZnPc 4. Whereas the PCE value of ZnPc 4 was lower than that of PcS18, which employs oxygen instead of sulfur, the onset of the IPCE spectrum of the ZnPc 4 cell was shifted by 20 nm compared with that of the PcS18 cell as shown in Fig. 3b. The substitution of oxygen atom by sulfur atom for ZnPc-based sensitizers resulted in the expansion of the light-harvesting range of the DSSCs.

Table 1 includes the previously published data of the solar cells using ZnPc containing oxygen. The analogous dyes of PcS15, 17, and 18 (ref. 16) are ZnPc 5, 3 and 4, respectively. All the dyes using sulfur gave lower Jsc than the dyes using oxygen. For the case of PcS18 and ZnPc 4, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed, and E(S+/S) potentials were determined to be 0.88 V and 1.00 V vs. NHE, respectively. Fig. 4 shows E(S+/S) and E(S+/S*) potentials of ZnPc 4 and PcS18. E(S+/S*) potentials were calculated from E(S+/S) and the zero–zero excitation energies (E0–0).16 The E0–0 values of ZnPc 4 and PcS18 were determined from the intersection of the normalized absorption and fluorescence spectra (Fig S9 in the ESI†). Thus, the E(S+/S) of ZnPc 4 is higher (lower in energy) than that of PcS18. This suggests the lower injection efficiency of ZnPc 4.26 Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G* level (Gaussian 16)27 for ZnPc 4 and PcS18 were further conducted to investigate the effect of sulfur atoms on the electronic injection efficiency. Time-dependent (TD) DFT calculations of ZnPc 4 and PcS18 reproduced the red-shift of the Q band by changing from ether to thioether linkages between the ZnPc core and peripheral units (Table S1†). The results are consistent with the results of CV measurements. These findings suggest that the calculated orbitals represent the actual ones. Fig. 4 also shows calculated HOMO and LUMO orbitals. The two dyes showed similar orbitals. Thus, the lower LUMO energy level of ZnPc 4 is probably the main reason for the low Jsc.

In the case of Voc, it seems that using the present dyes employing sulfur resulted in lower Voc for DSSCs than using previous dyes employing oxygen. In order to examine the lower Voc, the electron lifetime and density in the solar cells were measured (Fig. 5). The dyes showed the values on the same line in the Vocvs. electron density plots, suggesting that the conduction band edge position of the TiO2 was the same for the dyes. The electron lifetimes of ZnPc series cells were shorter than those of PcS18, explaining the lower Voc.

Since the adsorption density of the ZnPc series was lower than that of PcS18, it may be suspected that the blocking effect of the ZnPc series against the approach of I3− to the surface of TiO2 is small. To check the possibility, a low dye loading electrode was prepared by dipping 1/10 of dye concentration solution, and the electron lifetime of the solar cells was measured. As expected, the lifetime was shortened, suggesting that the fully adsorbed PcS18 film has a better blocking effect. ZnPc 2 cells were prepared from dye solutions using different solvents and the electron lifetimes in the solar cells were measured. The cells prepared with THF had much lower adsorbed dyes in comparison to the cells prepared with toluene (Table 1) and showed shorter electron lifetime. However, the difference was small, suggesting the less effective blocking effect for the fully adsorbed cells. Also, the decreased lifetime with lower adsorption density indicates that the sulfur atoms in ZnPc 2 did not facilitate the charge recombination in the cells.
Among the ZnPc series, the interpretation for Voc and the electron lifetime is not straight forward. The blocking effect emerges when the adsorbed dyes cover the surface of the TiO2 electrode. Bulky molecules may be expected to cover the surface well and thus to show a better blocking effect. However, molecules are adsorbed on the surface one by one and the molecules are probably adsorbed randomly. Thus, relatively large TiO2 surface may be left between the adsorbed bulky molecules. For the ZnPc series, the dyes having phenyl moieties may be expected to show a better blocking effect but ZnPc 1 did not show long electron lifetime (data not shown). It might be due to the long bridge between the Pc core and TiO2 surface. The adsorbed molecules can swing on the surface. The long bridge could result in the larger swing, giving larger space between the molecules.
To study the effect of sulfur on the reduction kinetics of oxidized dyes, we measured transient absorption of the solar cells using a pulsed laser. Fig. 6 shows the reduction kinetics of oxidized dyes. Between ZnPc 4 and PcS18, by taking into account the free energy difference for the reduction kinetics, both dyes showed similar kinetics. Thus, there is little difference between sulfur and oxygen in terms of the reduction kinetics. ZnPc 1 and ZnPc 2 showed similar kinetics, showing that the phenyl and isopropyl moieties have a similar effect on the kinetics.
 Fig. 6  Transient absorption of oxidized dyes in the dye sensitized solar cells. The laser pulses (150 ps, 532 nm, 2.9 mJ cm−2, 1 Hz) were irradiated on the solar cells and the transient absorption was monitored using a continuous laser (980 nm). 
Conclusions
A series of ZnPc-based dyes ZnPc 1–6 for DSSCs, in which the bulky substituents were connected to the ZnPc core through thioester linkages, were synthesized to investigate the effect of the sulfur atom on the performances of ZnPc-sensitized DSSCs. The replacement of the oxygen atom with the sulfur atom in the aromatic system resulted in the red-shift of the Q band of ZnPc in the UV-Vis spectrum (about 30 nm) and the expansion of the light-harvesting range in the DSSCs. Employing sulfur also increased the E(S+/S) potential. Thus, it also increased E(S+/S*) potential, resulting probably in a lower charge injection yield. In terms of electron transfer kinetics, sulfur atoms in the ZnPc series did not have any effect on the charge recombination and the reduction kinetics of the oxidized dyes. Thus, the lower Voc observed for the ZnPc series is mostly due to lower dye adsorption density.
