    , Accepted 12th April 2023First published on 17th May 2023AbstractState-of-the-art perovskite solar cells often employ expensive organic hole transporting materials (HTM) such as spiro-OMeTAD, motivating the search for potential alternatives. Here we report single-crystal data of EDOT-amide-TPA as well as the first utilization of EDOT-amide-TPA as HTM for Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite solar cells, outperforming spiro-OMeTAD. The dense packing of the EDOT-amide-TPA film improves the charge carrier extraction, increasing the JSC and PCE.
Introduction
Lead-based halide perovskites have attracted great interest as the efficiency of solar cells comprising this materials class sharply increased from 3.8% to 25.5% within only 13 years.1,2 This fast development is owed to great efforts aimed at optimizing the complete solar cell, as well as the chemical and physical properties of the lead-based perovskites themselves.3 However, while featuring excellent optoelectronic properties, these materials suffer from several drawbacks such as a rather low stability against ambient conditions and the severe toxicity of lead. Therefore, lead-free alternatives have been intensively investigated, leading to several promising alternatives such as double perovskites with the general formula A2MIMIIIX6.4–7
Many different double perovskites have been theoretically investigated in computational studies, yet only a handful of materials have been successfully synthesized or even integrated into thin-film devices.8–13 Among these materials, Cs2AgBiBr6 has so far been realized in solar cells exceeding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3%. This material, however, suffers from several drawbacks, heretofore preventing solar cells with Cs2AgBiBr6 as active layer from exceeding an efficiency of 3.1% and 4% in organic blends respectively.14–17 While this double perovskite features a rather large and indirect bandgap (1.9 to 2.3 eV, depending on the synthesis technique),12,18–21 solar cells with this material are limited in their performance by rather small electron diffusion lengths, self-trapping of charge carriers and polaron formation.22–24 Moreover, it was found that solar cells comprising this material suffer from a rather low contact selectivity, large ionic conductivity and an unfavorable energy level alignment towards typical hole transporting materials (HTM).14,17,20,25
To overcome the above limitations, much effort has been put into the optimization of the solar cells themselves. While mixing Cs2AgBiBr6 with an organic absorber material to form perovskite-dye hybrid solar cells enhances the current density by extending the absorption spectra, it was also found that the formation of a 2D/3D hybrid material upon addition of phenethyl ammonium bromide as spacer cation leads to an enhanced contact-selectivity and thus to an increased VOC.15,17 Moreover, similar to lead-based perovskites, the charge transporting layers have been investigated. While modification of the electron transport layer (ETL) does increase current density in the solar cells, the influence of different hole-transporting materials has been investigated as well.14,26–29
The development of new charge transport layers is a major research field for lead-based perovskites in order to improve the energy level alignment and conductivity of the materials and to reduce the production costs of the solar cells in general.30–34 A focus was also put on the synthesis, using, for example, simple condensation chemistry to reduce the costs and environmental impact of the HTM synthesis, especially since the production of spiro-OMeTAD suffers from rather high costs and extensive usage of chlorinated solvents.35–37
Despite the great importance of HTMs in this field, not much is known about the structural properties of organic HTMs, as single crystal analysis has not been conducted to a great extent.
Here, we extend the investigation of HTMs towards application in Cs2AgBiBr6-based solar cells. We use N5,N7-bis(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b] [1,4]dioxine-5,7-dicarboxamide (EDOT-amide-TPA),31 an HTM that is known to boost the PCE of lead-based perovskites and investigate for the first time the crystal structure of this material to link the optoelectronic properties to the structural properties.
Structure
To obtain the single crystals, 1 mg (1.25 μmol) EDOT-amide-TPA was dissolved in 1 mL dimethyl sulfoxide upon heating to 80 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the solution was transferred into a crystallization tube with a diameter of 5 mm. After two weeks at room temperature, orange colored, block-shaped single crystals were obtained and measured using X-ray single crystal analysis. The resulting structure is shown in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Crystal structure of EDOT-amide-TPA: a) view along the a-axis, b) view along the b-axis. Panel c) shows the drawn structure from ref. 30. Inset: Zoom of the EDOT-cores. 
In ref. 31, we introduced the amide-based HTM for the first time, using it as HTM in lead-based perovskite solar cells. In that work, we linked several chemical and optoelectronic properties to the structure of the material. We find that EDOT-amide-TPA crystallizes in the triclinic space group P (see ESI†).

Fig. 1a) shows the crystal structure viewed along the a-axis. The figure reveals that the intended structure of the molecule shown in Fig. 1c) matches nicely with the actual structure obtained from single crystal analysis. The crystal structure shows alternating stacking along the a-axis, where every layer is rotated by exactly 180° with respect to the former layer to prevent electrostatic repulsion. In addition, the EDOT-cores are shifted along the (0kl) plane along the reciprocal  vector in order to avoid steric repulsion, leading to a conformation in which the sulfur atoms are stacked on top of the N3 amide-group. At the same time the HTM shows close packing, which can be seen in Fig. 1b), with distances of 3.82(3) Å between S1 and H3′, which belongs to the amide-group. In contrast to other triphenyl amine derivatives known in the literature, this leads to a very rigid structure with lower rotational freedom along the C32–N4 and C11–N2 axes.38 This close packing is made possible by the formerly discussed shift of the molecules towards each other, avoiding both steric and electrostatic repulsions. The methoxy groups of the triphenyl amine units are in plane with their respective aromatic ring, the TPA unit itself, however, is highly twisted. This in turn leads to favorable intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the oxygen of the methoxy group and hydrogen atoms of the adjacent phenyl groups. The same principle can be observed for the di-ether ring of the EDOT-core, with intermolecular hydrogen bonds between O6–H6B (2.71(24) Å) and O6–H5B (2.91(22) Å) respectively. Finally, hydrogen bonding between the ketone and the C29–C34 phenyl group (O3–H34) itself can be observed, resulting in a hydrogen bonding distance of 3.01(23) Å. The keto groups also form hydrogen bonds with hydrogen atoms that are part of the adjacent methoxy group along the (0kl) plane. The obtained bond lengths vary between 2.68–2.94 Å (see ESI†). Another interesting hydrogen bonding behavior can be seen when looking at the interaction of the terminal methoxy groups with adjacent molecules. Here, a large number of hydrogen bonds with bonding distances between 2.56 and 3.37 Å can be observed for O4 and O5. Ultimately, hydrogen bonding along the (0kl) plane along the reciprocal  vector between the terminal methoxy groups and the di-ether ring exhibit bond lengths of 2.40 to 2.98 Å (see ESI†). With that, all mentioned hydrogen bonds exhibit distances comparable to literature values, with rather weak bond strengths being observed.39–42 The large number of intermolecular hydrogen bonding leads to favorable close packing of the HTM molecules in all directions, which in turn is known to have a major impact on charge carrier properties.43
DFT calculations of the structure suggest a planar nature of both the EDOT-core as well as the adjacent phenyl groups.31 This, however, is not the case in the crystal structure. In order to facilitate hydrogen bonding, C5 and C6 are shifted out of plane, resulting in a torsion angle of 30.9(2)° (C3–C4–C5–C6). At the same time, the phenyl rings C29–C34 and C8–C13 are tilted out of plane as well. This leads to torsion angles of 31.6(5)° (C28–N3–C29–C30) and 16.6(5)° (C7–N1–C8–C9), respectively.
Solar cells
In our previous publication, we showed that EDOT-amide-TPA works well when employed in lead-based perovskite solar cells, outperforming the well-established spiro-OMeTAD.31 To investigate the influence of the amide-HTM layer on the performance of lead-free Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite, and to extend the study of the amide-HTM itself, we measured solar cells using EDOT-amide-TPA as HTM and compared them with cells made with spiro-OMeTAD (Table 1 and Fig. 2).

All cells were measured within the same batch and pixels with J/V-curve anomalies such as high noise or abrupt curve changes as well as pixels that were shorted or damaged were excluded from the statistics. Each batch comprised the same number of devices for both HTMs.

Table 1 and Fig. 2 show that using EDOT-amide-TPA as HTM results in solar cells with efficiencies of up to 2.13%. Cells using spiro-OMeTAD produce efficiencies of up to 1.8%. On average, an increase in efficiencies by 0.15% was observed. While only a slight increase can be found in the FF, the largest increase was detected for the JSC values of the solar cells. For cells containing the amide-HTM, the average value of the JSC increases from 2.85 mA cm−2 for cells comprising spiro-OMeTAD to 3.12 mA cm−2. The average increase of 0.27 mA cm−2 matches well with the values obtained from the champion cells. The increased JSC indicates an improved charge carrier collection within the solar cells. The enhanced charge carrier collection with EDOT-amide-TPA was already shown in time resolved microwave conductivity measurements (TRMC) on lead based perovskites containing EDOT-amide-TPA, where faster hole injection into the HTM than for samples with spiro-OMeTAD was established.31 The JSC increase can also be seen in an enhancement of the external quantum efficiency (EQE, Fig. 3d), where an increase of the maximum values from 50% to approximately 57% suggests an improved charge carrier generation for cells comprising EDOT-amide-TPA. Interestingly, in contrast to our findings in ref. 31, the VOC of EDOT-amide-TPA samples is not increased compared to cells containing spiro-OMeTAD (1.00 V vs. 0.99 V). This is also contrary to the energy level alignment, where a slightly deeper HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) energy level with −5.23 eV is found for EDOT-amide-TPA compared to −5.07 eV for spiro-OMeTAD.31,44 Moreover, the VOC-values suggest that no enhanced surface trap passivation of the Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite layer through EDOT-amide-TPA is taking place, as observed for lead-based perovskites due to the coordination of lead atoms. The higher FF, however, suggests an overall improvement of the film quality. This is illustrated by the high number of functioning cells when using EDOT-amide-TPA (80) compared to spiro-OMeTAD with only 35 cells, suggesting a better reproducibility of the results and a higher quality of the solar cells. Although the average FF increase is small (from 54% to 56%), the champion cells show the largest FF increase with 8%. This could result from better film formation behavior of the amide-based HTM, further described in the following paragraph and hence could lead to the observed more efficient charge carrier collection.

Structural and optoelectronic properties
As suggested by the enhanced current density obtained from cells comprising EDOT-amide-TPA as well as the EQE results (Fig. 3d), the solar cells containing the amide-HTM profit from an enhanced charge carrier collection.
A comparison of the single crystal data of spiro-OMeTAD with EDOT-amide-TPA shows a drastically reduced unit cell volume in case of the amide-HTM, although spiro-OMeTAD crystallizes in the same space group (Fig. S4†). We note that EDOT-amide-TPA, thanks to the alternating directions of the EDOT-cores as well as the twisting of the triphenyl amine groups, enables a denser molecular packing in the solid state. With amounts used that are found to provide the highest solar cell performance for each HTM, thinner HTM layers and thus a more efficient charge carrier extraction can be achieved with EDOT-amide-TPA. Strikingly, when comparing the optimum layer thicknesses obtained by SEM-cross-section images (Fig. S1†), the layer of EDOT-amide-TPA shows a thickness of only around 70 nm compared to the thickness of the spiro-OMeTAD layer of around 200 nm – while not introducing higher defect densities or pinholes in the films. As thinner HTM layers often tend to increase the number of shunted devices, the high number of working solar cell pixels with EDOT-amide-TPA underlines its outstanding film formation properties.
Consistent with the formation of more densely packed thinner HTM layers for EDOT-amide-TPA, enhanced conductivity and hole-mobility was observed for the corresponding thin films (conductivity σ = 10−5 S cm−1 for spiro-OMeTAD vs. 10−3 S cm−1 for EDOT-amide-TPA and hole-mobility μ = 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for spiro-OMeTAD vs. μ = 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for EDOT-amide-TPA).31
The influence of the HTM on the VOC was investigated with photoluminescence (PL) experiments, where we measured several spots of thin films with either the architecture glass/Cs2AgBiBr6/spiro-OMeTAD or glass/Cs2AgBiBr6/EDOT-amide-TPA to perform steady state, fluence dependent steady state and time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements. Based on the steady state PL quenching experiments (Fig. 3a) at open circuit voltage conditions, we see a lower quenching effect for thin films featuring a Cs2AgBiBr6/EDOT-amide-TPA-interface compared to samples containing spiro-OMeTAD as HTM. This suggests lower non-radiative recombination losses compared to the spiro-OMeTAD samples.
Since the PL signals of pristine Cs2AgBiBr6 and pure spiro-OMeTAD overlap strongly (Fig. S6†), evaluation of TRPL of samples comprising spiro-OMeTAD is not feasible.45 However, the thin films featuring the Cs2AgBiBr6/EDOT-amide-TPA interface show PL lifetimes comparable to the samples without any HTM. A faster initial decay of the PL signal of the Cs2AgBiBr6/EDOT-amide-TPA sample in the time range between 0.0 μs and 0.2 μs compared to the pristine Cs2AgBiBr6 sample can be observed (Fig. 3c), indicating a charge transfer to the EDOT-amide-TPA.46 Furthermore, the very fast decay of Cs2AgBiBr6/spiro-OMeTAD might also indicate an efficient charge transfer from the double perovskite to the transport layer. However, due to the strong overlap of the PL spectra of Cs2AgBiBr6 and pure spiro-OMeTAD at this point this interpretation is still tentative.
Comparing the fluence-dependent steady-state measurements (Fig. 3b), we found different effects within the recombination behavior comparing the pristine thin films with the samples covered with the different HTMs. Consistent with our previous work,31 all investigated thin films show a change in their slope going from the region of low incident laser fluence to high fluence. This we explain with a change of the dominating recombination behavior from Shockley–Read–Hall (trap-assisted) recombination to excitonic recombination, as a slope around 1.5 indicates a Shockley–Read–Hall recombination behavior, whereas a slope of around 1 points towards an excitonic dominated recombination behavior.17,27,47 With respect to each other, however, the thin films comprising either no HTM or EDOT-amide-TPA show the same slope, both in the low-intensity and high-intensity region. This suggests that the addition of EDOT-amide-TPA does not change the recombination pathways at the perovskite/HTM interface, as already indicated by the VOC values. Inspecting the graph of the spiro-OMeTAD samples, we found changes in the slopes compared to the EDOT-amide-TPA samples. Here, we found a smaller slope of 0.98 in the region of low incident laser intensity for spiro-OMeTAD compared to 1.27 for EDOT-amide-TPA, which indicates a slight change of the recombination pathways at low intensities towards an excitonic dominated regime for cells containing spiro-OMeTAD. However, as pure spiro-OMeTAD and pristine Cs2AgBiBr6 exhibit overlapping photoluminescence maxima, the fluence dependent PL signal can be heavily affected by recombination mechanisms taking place in spiro-OMeTAD. Therefore, we also measured fluence dependent PL of pure spiro-OMeTAD (Fig. S8†) confirming that excitonic recombination of charge carriers in the spiro-OMeTAD is dominating over the whole measured intensity range. As a similar recombination behavior was also found in the layered structure of double perovskite and spiro-OMeTAD, we therefore conclude that the dominant recombination in the layered structure probably takes place in the transport layer. A detailed interpretation of the charge carrier recombination of samples using spiro-OMeTAD should therefore only be made with caution.
Conclusion
Here we explored the EDOT-amide-TPA as possible HTM for lead-free perovskite solar cells. In particular, we report the crystal structure of EDOT-amide-TPA. It crystallizes in the triclinic space group P with short intermolecular distances and very dense molecular packing in contrast to the well-established HTM spiro-OMeTAD.
A comparison of EDOT-amide-TPA with spiro-OMeTAD shows an improved efficiency with the former when employed in lead-free double perovskite solar cells. Interestingly, in contrast to lead-based perovskites, the better performance of EDOT-amide-TPA cannot be attributed to higher VOC-values but rather to an improved charge carrier extraction, leading to higher JSC-values. This is confirmed by PL and EQE measurements and was explained by decreased recombination losses in the lead-free perovskite solar cells compared to the lead-based perovskites. The improved current densities were explained by the rather thin and compact HTM layer that is sufficient for EDOT-amide-TPA, which is in line with the dense molecular packing in the solid state achieved by EDOT-amide-TPA. The dense molecular packing of the HTM not only enables the formation of a thinner HTM layer but also increases the reproducibility of solar cell manufacturing.
