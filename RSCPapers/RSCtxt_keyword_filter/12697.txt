    , Accepted 22nd September 2019First published on 23rd September 2019AbstractWe fabricated a chlorophyll (Chl)-based biosolar cell with H2Chl-sensitized TiO2 as an acceptor and (ZnChl)n as a donor. This solar cell gives a relatively high quantum yield from the absorption spectral contribution from both the donor and acceptor species. We employed subpicosecond time-resolved absorption spectroscopy (TAS) to study the excited state dynamics at the Chl interface. A charge transfer (CT) state between TiO2–H2Chl and (ZnChl)n was observed at 640 nm after excitation at the Qy peaks, 680 nm and 720 nm. This CT state is entirely different from the CT states observed for either TiO2–H2Chl (TiO2–H2Chl/spiro-OMeTAD) or TiO2–(ZnChl)n systems. Due to the slower charge transfer process from H2Chl+ to TiO2 as compared to that from (ZnChl)n+ to H2Chl, the CT lifetimes of H2Chl−–(ZnChl)n+ (τ1 = 0.1 ps, τ2 = 1.4 ps) excited at 720 nm are slightly shorter than that excited at 680 nm (τ1 = 0.2 ps, τ2 = 5.6 ps). The TAS results suggest that the interface of TiO2–H2Chl and (ZnChl)n not only transfers holes as spiro-OMeTAD does, but also provides a built-in field for charge dissociation between the two Chl species.
Introduction
Chlorophylls (Chls) play important roles in photosynthesis, and are proven to exhibit charge injection and transport in photovoltaics to realize energy conversion and applications.1–3 The J-aggregates of some Chl molecules found in natural chlorosomal antennae are of particular interest in artificial energy conversion devices due to their long lifetime of excited states and high carrier mobility. Recently, we employed the J-aggregates of Chl derivatives as hole transporters in perovskite solar cells and obtained decent performance.4 In parallel, we also combined a carboxylated Chl molecule and a self-aggregated zinc Chl derivative in Chl-based biosolar cells (BSCs) in order to realize a “green” solar cell.5 However, the self-aggregates of zinc Chl derivatives act as a hole transporter, leading to a poor power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.1%. The performance of this Chl-based BSC was further improved by molecular engineering on the peripheral substituents and also solvent engineering.6 Recently, we fabricated trilayer BSCs containing a heterojunction of H2Chl-sensitized TiO2 and (ZnChl)n,7 but the charge separation mechanism is unknown. The excited-state dynamics and charge transfer process of Chls have been investigated,8–10 and many different decay components in fast photophysical processes within chlorosomes or chlorosome-like aggregates have been identified from a 100 fs to 100 ps timescale, but in a protein environment, the excited-state and charge-transfer properties would be changed drastically. In photosynthetic systems, the fast relaxation process from a higher multi-exciton state to the one-exciton state in the zinc chlorin aggregates was determined to be 100 ± 5 fs, the subsequent relaxation from the Q-exciton state to the dark non-fluorescent CT state was found to be 850 ± 70 fs, and the excitonic dephasing time in zinc chlorin aggregates was determined to be 23 ± 1 fs.11,12 However, the working mechanism behind such devices is still waiting to be explored.
In this work, we fabricated Chl-based BSCs with previously investigated Chl derivatives and measured the photovoltaic performance to confirm contributions from both donor and acceptor Chl molecules. Based on such devices, we employed transient absorption spectroscopy on single/double layer Chls to investigate the excited-state dynamic at the interface. Here, we establish a basic charge transfer model to understand such devices, so that possible improvement in the devices could be proposed.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the chemical structures of the Chl derivatives that were employed in this study. Methyl trans-32-carboxy-pyropheophorbide-a (H2Chl)13 has a carboxy group in the C3-substituent on a tetrapyrrole ring, which could bond with mesoporous TiO2 and inject electrons to the mesoporous TiO2 film efficiently. 3-Devinyl-3-hydroxymethyl-pyropheophorbide-a (ZnChl)14 with a hydroxy group in the C3-substituent could self-assemble into a π-stacked aggregation (denoted as (ZnChl)n) through its intermolecular interaction with the zinc ion and the keto-carbonyl group at the C13 position.14 The π-stacked aggregates with a highly regular structure in the solid state share an excellent ability of light-harvesting and charge transfer.
 Fig. 1  (a) The chemical structures of the Chl derivatives and (b) the UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of H2Chl dissolved in THF, TiO2–H2Chl film (upper), ZnChl in THF, and (ZnChl)n film (lower). 
The ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) absorption spectra of Chls (H2Chl and ZnChl) dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and their solid films are shown in Fig. 1b. The Qy absorption peak of H2Chl in THF is situated at 678 nm. Upon binding to TiO2, the Qy peak of H2Chl red-shifts to 684 nm and broadens slightly. These changes could be attributed to the partial intermolecular interaction of H2Chl molecules on the TiO2 surface. The Soret peak is situated at 424 nm and the Qy peak locates at 652 nm for a THF solution of ZnChl. However, the Soret and Qy bands of (ZnChl)n red-shift to 447 nm and 734 nm, respectively. The changes of absorption spectra indicate that the film formed π-stacked self-aggregates via self-assemblies of ZnChl molecules.14
Prior to the targeted investigation on the excited state dynamics between these Chls, we fabricated Chl-based BSCs with TiO2–H2Chl as an acceptor and (ZnChl)n as a donor. The illustration of the solar cell configuration of the Chl-based BSC is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). And Fig. 2a displays the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the Chl-based BSC without the Ag electrode. From the SEM image, we could easily find that the compact TiO2 layer is about 55 ± 10 nm, the thickness of the H2Chl-absorbed mesoporous TiO2 is 518 ± 15 nm, and that of (ZnChl)n is approximately 41 ± 10 nm. To better study the excited state dynamics at the interface of the two Chl species, Fig. 2b displays the energy level diagram of the Chl-based BSCs. The energy levels of TiO2–H2Chl and (ZnChl)n are matched, and both electrons and holes can be transferred efficiently.

Fig. 2c shows the photovoltaic performance of the Chl-based BSCs with the corresponding photovoltaic parameters (inset). The PCE of the solar cell is 1.33% determined by the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.67 V, the short-circuit current (Jsc) of 4.49 mA cm−2, and the fill factor (FF) of 0.44. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the histograms of the photovoltaic parameters, which were obtained from 30 devices of the Chl-based BSCs. Fig. 2d presents the UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectrum of TiO2–H2Chl/(ZnChl)n film and the monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) profile of the Chl-based BSCs. The UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectrum of TiO2–H2Chl/(ZnChl)n contains the Soret peak in the region of 350–500 nm, which can be attributed to both H2Chl and (ZnChl)n. And there are two absorption peaks (523 nm and 561 nm) in the region of 500–570 nm, which could be attributed to the Qx bands of H2Chl. Meanwhile, the Qy peaks could be found at 685 and 729 nm, which are comparable to the absorption peaks of H2Chl and (ZnChl)n. Obviously, from the IPCE profile, the photocurrent response mainly comes from the Soret (446 nm), Qx (523 nm, 561 nm and 644 nm), and Qy bands (683 nm and 729 nm) of H2Chl and (ZnChl-2)n. It is worth noting that the Q bands of H2Chl and (ZnChl-2)n provide the majority of photocurrent. Therefore, both of H2Chl and (ZnChl)n could be excited to generate photocurrent. And the IPCE can be described with the following equation: IPCE(λ) = ηAηEDηCTηCC,(1)where ηA(λ) is absorption efficiency, ηED is exciton diffusion efficiency, which is mainly determined by exciton diffusion length as well as the morphology of the donor/accepter interface, ηCT is charge transfer efficiency at the interface, and ηCC is charge collection efficiency. Therefore, IPCE is the spectral result reflecting the excited state dynamics process. Clearly, the photoresponse of the IPCE that is a synergistic event of excited dynamics is observed for both H2Chl and (ZnChl)n.
The observation of a spectral contribution in the IPCE profile from both H2Chl and (ZnChl)n suggests that the charge transfer may occur at their interface. To elucidate this charge transfer process, we employed transient absorption spectroscopy on both single (TiO2–H2Chl and TiO2–(ZnChl)n) and double layer films (TiO2–H2Chl/(ZnChl)n) of Chls. Fig. 3a shows the spectra of the TiO2–H2Chl film at different time delays with a 680 nm pump, which is near the Qy absorption peak of H2Chl. Immediately after excitation (delay time at 0.08 ps in Fig. 3a), a broad absorption between 460 and 650 nm and a bleaching signal from the Qy absorption could be observed, and then decay to half of the maximum occurred within 1 ps. The recovery dynamic of this bleaching signal corresponds to the charge recombination between TiO2 and H2Chl.15 The bleaching signal exhibits a typical red-shift during the decay process. This phenomenon has been previously described as the formation of excimer,16 due to the intermolecular interaction between the excited-state molecules with large polarity and the adjacent ground state molecules in a face-to-face fashion. It is salvation dynamics which is time-dependent by hole transporting in the aggregate. Generally speaking, the formation of excimer could be detected by relevant excited state fluorescence,17 leading to a large red-shift of fluorescence emission. The weakly bound H2Chl molecules are expected to form a major part of the excimers, as previously observed by the similar presence of carboxylated Chls on TiO2 in the forms of both monomer and aggregate.18 This idea is further confirmed by the J–V curve of a solar cell fabricated with a structure of FTO/compact TiO2/TiO2–H2Chl/Ag in Fig. S3 (ESI†). From the corresponding photovoltaic parameters in Table S1 (ESI†), the photocurrent of 0.46 mA cm−2 could be obtained by such a solar cell with H2Chl as the sole absorber and carrier transporter. The latter advantage of carrier transporter can only be provided by excimer, which is the weakly bound H2Chl molecules.

The broad absorption peak at 610 nm is known as the absorption of the charge transfer (CT) state of TiO2−–H2Chl+.15,19 This signal is generated immediately after photo-excitation of H2Chl, because the electron injection rate from the dye to TiO2 is in the femtosecond time scale,20,21 which is much shorter than the laser pulse used in the present investigation. The recovery dynamic of the bleaching signal corresponds to the charge recombination between TiO2 and H2Chl. And when TiO2–H2Chl was excited, the CT state of TiO2−–H2Chl+ was generated immediately, thus the bleaching signal and the transient absorption signal should refer to the same process. The above assignment is supported by the fast component of the bleaching signal at 680 nm, τ1 = 0.9 ps, and the transient absorption signal at 610 nm, τ1 = 1.7 ps (Fig. S4, ESI†), which are comparable to time scales within the system resolution (τ1 = 0.9 ps, τ2 = 54.7 ps vs. τ1 = 1.7 ps, τ2 = 54.5 ps). The two lifetimes were assigned to the excited state electron/hole transfer time (the single Chl gives charge transfer between Chl and TiO2, and the complex Chl system induces the intersystem crossing between two Chls) and the electron relaxation time of the excited state.

Fig. 3b shows the TAS‡ of TiO2–H2Chl film after spin-coating with the typical hole-transporter 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD). Once spiro-OMeTAD is added, an absorption peak around 700 nm (Fig. S5, ESI†) appears that is consistent with the oxidized species of spiro-OMeTAD.22,23 In the presence of spiro-OMeTAD, the profile of TAS (delay time at 0.12 ps in Fig. 3b) remains the same, and it is obvious that the sensitivity of the system is below 10−4 OD. However, the lifetime in the entire spectral region becomes much shorter as representatively indicated by the decay profile at 680 nm in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The fast relaxation process is even faster than the IRF of our TA system, which is probably due to the hole transfer process from the radical cation of H2Chl to spiro-OMeTAD.24 The TAS results on TiO2–H2Chl/spiro-OMeTAD confirm the role of spiro-OMeTAD that simply improves hole transport as in conventional solid-state solar cells.
We further measured the TAS of the (ZnChl)n film on a glass substrate with(out) the presence of porous TiO2 (Fig. 4). After excitation at the Qy absorption peak of (ZnChl)n at 720 nm (delay time at 0.08 ps), bare (ZnChl)n film exhibits two bleaching signals at the Soret (454 nm) and Qy bands (734 nm), corresponding to the excitation of electrons in the ground state. Meanwhile, there is a broad absorption signal between 600 and 700 nm with a peak around 675 nm, and this absorption peak exhibits a much shorter lifetime as compared to these bleaching signals. The absorption peak originated from the excited-state absorption (ESA) and the ESA might come from an intermediate state. The weak absorption between 500 and 650 nm (delay time at 0.08 ps) was also found in similar aggregation systems with protochlorophyllide.25 In that system, such a process with an initial short lifetime of 0.6 ps (Fig. S7, ESI†) was described as the transition of excitonic states to the nonradiative CT states. Our results suggest that a similar process may take place in the spin-coated (ZnChl)n film.

Fig. 4b shows the TAS of (ZnChl)n on porous TiO2. In the presence of bare TiO2, the absorption signal from ESA disappears and a spectral feature of the CT state could be observed between TiO2 and (ZnChl)n at 0.12 ps delay time. The spectral peak of the CT state is blue-shifted as the relaxation time increases, which may be due to the excited-state cooling.

Fig. 5 shows the TAS of TiO2–H2Chl/(ZnChl)n pumped at 680 nm and 720 nm. These TAS spectra show typical ground state bleaching signals at 725 nm from (ZnChl)n. In both cases, a CT state peak could be commonly observed around 640 nm (delay time at 0.28 ps and 0.2 ps) that is different from the CT state for either the TiO2–H2Chl or TiO2–(ZnChl)n system shown in Fig. 3a and 4b. Baesd on the system sensitivity in Fig. 3b, obviously, the CT states that we observed are credible. After excitation of H2Chl at 680 nm, the fast electron injection from H2Chl to TiO2 generated the radical cation of H2Chl (H2Chl+) in a few femtoseconds. The hole transfer from H2Chl+ to (ZnChl)n can generate a new CT state between these Chl species in the solar cells. Similarly, excitation of (ZnChl)n at 720 nm can also generate the CT state between the two Chl species together with photo-induced absorption from ESA as evidenced by the absorption species around 675 nm (delay time at 0.2 ps). The clear CT state generation between these Chl species strongly suggests that charge dissociation and transfer occur at their interface.
 Fig. 5  The TAS of (a) TiO2–H2Chl/(ZnChl)n pumped at 680 nm and (b) TiO2–H2Chl/(ZnChl)n pumped at 720 nm. 

Fig. 6 shows the kinetic decay traces of TiO2–H2Chl/(ZnChl)n at both 640 nm and 725 nm after being pumped at both 680 nm and 720 nm. The decay curves were fitted with a multi-exponential function and a Gaussian function with 30 fs half width at half maximum. The lifetimes of the CT state at 640 nm, under the excitation wavelength of 720 nm for (ZnChl)n (τ1 = 0.1 ps, τ2 = 1.4 ps), were shorter than those at 680 nm for H2Chl (τ1 = 0.2 ps, τ2 = 5.6 ps). The difference in the CT state lifetimes indicates that H2Chl+–(ZnChl)n− is a component with longer lifetimes compared to H2Chl−–(ZnChl)n+, probably because electrons in H2Chl can slowly transfer to the TiO2 electrode. On the other hand, for the excitation wavelengths both at 680 nm and 720 nm, the bleaching signals at 725 nm have similar lifetimes. The lifetime of the bleaching signal is only slightly longer than that of the CT state, indicating that the CT process is the determining process of all events after photo-excitation.

Conclusion
To summarize, we have successfully enhanced the photovoltaic performance of the Chl-based BSCs to 1.33%. The IPCE spectrum of the Chl-based BSC displays a specific response from both H2Chl and (ZnChl)n, indicating that charge dissociation and transfer may take place at the interface of the two Chl species. To further confirm the charge dissociation and transfer at their interface, we measured the TAS of single and double layer films of the Chls. An obvious CT state of TiO2−–H2Chl+ at 610 nm is observed in the TAS of TiO2–H2Chl film. TiO2–H2Chl/spiro-OMeTAD shares the identical CT state (TiO2−–H2Chl+) with the TAS of TiO2–H2Chl. But the lifetime is decreased, which may be attributed to the hole transfer process from H2Chl+ to spiro-OMeTAD. In the TAS of TiO2–(ZnChl)n, there is a CT state between (ZnChl)n and TiO2, suggesting that charge transfer could occur between them. However, a significant CT state peak could be observed around 640 nm in the TAS of TiO2–H2Chl/(ZnChl)n, which is different from the CT states for either TiO2–H2Chl or TiO2–(ZnChl)n systems. This phenomenon indicates that the charge dissociation and transfer could occur at the interface of both the Chl species. In the meantime, photo-excitation on either the H2Chl or (ZnChl)n component generates the same H2Chl+–(ZnChl)n− CT state with a slightly different lifetime. Therefore, we can further prove that the Chl-based BSC works coefficiently with these two Chl species, leading to an effective charge dissociation and transfer at their interface.
