    , Accepted 8th June 2021First published on 8th June 2021AbstractAll-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) exhibiting superior device stability and mechanical robustness have attracted considerable interest. Emerging polymerized small-molecule acceptors (PSMAs) have promoted the progress of all-PSCs exceeding a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 14%. However, most of the all-PSCs are processed with halogenated solvents that are hazardous towards humans and the environment. Herein, halogen-free processing solvents of CS2, 1,2,4-TMB and o-XY are utilized for producing eco-friendly and highly efficient all-PSCs. In particular, o-XY solvent-processed all-PSCs achieve a high PCE of 15.6%, which is among the highest values in green-solvent-processed all-PSCs to date. Detailed investigations reveal that such enhancement is mainly attributed to the optimal blend morphology and polymer crystalline structures, which is resulted from aggregated structures of polymers formed in o-XY. Importantly, o-XY-processed-all-PSCs are successfully fabricated in ambient conditions, affording a high PCE approaching 15.0%. This work highlights the importance of green solvent strategy in controlling the polymer aggregated structures and blend film morphology of all-PSCs, paving the way towards high-performance and eco-friendly all-PSCs for practical applications.

Broader context
Polymer solar cells (PSCs), composed of polymer semiconducting materials, directly converting solar energy into needed electrical energy, can be fabricated through large-scale roll-to-roll processing. Thereinto, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), consisting of polymer donors and polymer acceptors, have drawn great attraction because of their excellent stability and better flexibility. Nevertheless, the development of all-PSCs relatively lagged behind due to greater difficulty in regulating all-polymer blend morphology. Very recently, the PCEs of all-PSCs have been increased up to over 14% mainly via the utilization of the “polymerized small-molecule acceptor” strategy. However, most high-performance all-PSCs are typically processed with chlorinated solvents, which are harmful to global environments and human health. Therefore, a series of halogen-free solvents such as 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF), cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME), as well as some toluene/o-xylene (o-XY) mixed solvents, have been developed to fabricate environmentally friendly all-PSCs. Despite the great effort, acquiring high-performance all-PSCs processed with such a non-chlorinated solvent remains a challenge. To this end, we delineate morphology–property–performance correlation using three green solvents of CS2, 1,2,4-TMB and o-XY with different boiling points (b.p.) to fine-tune the BHJ morphology, which provides useful guidelines towards highly efficient and eco-friendly all-PSCs.

All-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) comprised of polymer donor/polymer acceptor blends have attracted great interest due to their various merits compared to conventional polymer donor/small-molecule acceptor blend-based devices1–10 including superior device stability and excellent mechanical robustness.11–19 Despite this, the development of all-PSCs relatively lagged behind20–23 due to the scarcity of high-performance polymer acceptors. The PSMA strategy proposed by Zhang et al. in 2017 largely changed this situation. The numerous existing non-fullerene SMAs can be used to develop a variety of polymer acceptors. The first PSMA named PZ1 showed a high extinction coefficient (>105 cm−1) and yielded a PCE of 9.19% in all-PSCs.24 Recently, all-PSCs have achieved high PCEs exceeding 14% mainly via the optimization of PSMA structures.25–30
Despite the remarkable progress in all-PSCs, most of them are extensively processed with chlorinated solvents25,30,31 (Table S1, ESI†) due to the large molecular sizes of polymers based on the fused rings.32,33 However, such halogenated solvents are inevitably hazardous to humans and the environment.34 In addition, expensive storage and waste disposal costs make halogenated solvents not sustainable.35 This means that halogenated solvents are not suitable for large-scale manufacturing.36,37 Hence, it is crucial and imperative to develop an eco-friendly process based on non-halogenated solvents for high-performance all-PSCs.38–40
It has been proposed that the ideal BHJ should feature a phase-separated structure of nanoscale interpenetrating network41 with abundant donor/acceptor (D/A) interface regions for efficient charge dissociation and transfer.42,43 As the processing solvents play a crucial role in regulating the polymer aggregated structures and drying kinetics during the formation of the BHJ morphology,44 attempts have been made to explore green solvents for fabricating active layers with favorable morphology in all-PSCs. In 2011, Tajima et al. introduced a mixture of toluene/o-xylene (o-XY) as processing solvents to fabricate all-PSCs and achieved a PCE of 2%, which was higher than that of chlorobenzene (CB)-based devices.45 Hou et al. utilized anisole with a lower toxicity as the processing solvent to produce all-PSC with a PCE of 5.4%.46 Recently, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF) and cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME) from renewable natural resources have been used for the preparation of all-PSCs with PCEs of 9%47 and 11%48 by Huang and co-workers, respectively. Additionally, other halogen-free solvents such as 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (1,2,4-TMB), tetrahydrofuran (THF), as well as some mesitylene/acetophenone mixed solvents, have been used to fabricate environmentally friendly all-PSCs.49,50 Nevertheless, the PCE values of all-PSCs processed with non-halogenated solvents still remain relatively low. Furthermore, it is of great importance to select the appropriate green solvents with suitable boiling point (b.p.) and solubility, especially for the all-PSC systems, because the control of the blend morphology is not trivial due to the very low entropy gain of mixing of two large donor and acceptor polymers.51 Thus, a systematic investigation of the effects of different green solvents on the morphological evolution and device performance of all-PSCs is important.
We first examine the solubility of the recently reported PM6:L14 all-polymer combination in a series of green solvents (Fig. S1 and Table S2, ESI†). Herein, we rationally selected CS2, 1,2,4-TMB and o-XY (Fig. 1b and Table S3, ESI†) with different boiling points as the host solvents to delve into the relationship between solvent processing and morphology control, aiming at the realization of highly efficient and eco-friendly all-PSCs. The CS2 solvent has a low b.p. of 46 °C, but the solubilities of PM6 and L14 in CS2 are relatively lower than those in 1,2,4-TMB and o-XY solvents. Compared with the green solvent of 1,2,4-TMB (b.p. of 168 °C), o-XY (b.p. of 144 °C) can offer a faster drying time that can promote the formation of a finely ordered microstructure during film drying via a warm spin-coating method.52 As a result, the optimized all-PSCs processed with o-XY exhibited an excellent PCE of 15.6%, which is the best value among the nonhalogenated-solvent-processed all-PSCs to date.53 In addition, we demonstrated the feasibility of green solvent processing in fabricating PM6:L14-based all-PSCs under ambient conditions, which achieves a high PCE of 14.9%.

The chemical structures of PM6 and L14 are shown in Fig. 1a and the polymer acceptor L14 is synthesized according to the method reported in our previous work.21 The absorption spectrum of the pristine PM6 film presented a distinct absorption band centered in the range of 500–650 nm, complementing that of the pure L14 film having strong absorption bands between 700–900 nm (Fig. 1c). In addition, the PM6:L14 blend film processed with o-XY displayed an enhanced absorption coefficient of 8.27 × 104 cm−1 compared to those (7.24 and 7.63 × 104 cm−1) of CS2 and 1,2,4-TMB-treated films (Fig. 1d), respectively, which facilitates the light absorption in all-PSCs. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PM6 and L14 were measured from cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. S2, ESI†) and the HOMO/LUMO values were calculated to be −5.45/−3.63 eV and −5.76/−3.92 eV, respectively. The PM6:L14 blend is soluble in CS2 at 35 °C as well as warm 1,2,4-TMB and o-XY solvents at 80 °C. It is worth noting that because the processing solvents of 1,2,4-TMB and o-XY have higher bps of 168 and 144 °C, a warm spin-coating technique at 60 °C was applied to accelerate the solvent evaporation and thereby prevent excessive phase-separations within the BHJ blend film.
The photovoltaic performances of all-PSCs processed with CS2, 1,2,4-TMB and o-XY were investigated with a conventional device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al (Fig. 1a). The detailed device fabrication conditions are shown in the ESI.† The control device was also prepared using halogenated solvent (CF). The D:A ratio of the PM6:L14 blend was fixed at 1:1 and the thermal annealing condition was optimized at 90 °C for 5 min. It is noted that non-halogenated solvent additives of 1-methoxynaphthalene (1-MN) and 1-phenylnaphthalene (1-PN) are applied to construct a totally green-solvent-processed system and optimize polymer crystalline structures in the blend films (Fig. S3, ESI†).54,55 The J–V characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of CS2, 1,2,4-TMB, o-XY and CF-processed all-PSCs are shown in Fig. 2a, c and Fig. S4 (ESI†), respectively. The detailed device parameters are summarized in Table 1 and the device optimization conditions such as solvent additives and film thickness are listed in Tables S4 and S5 (ESI†).

The control device processed with CF showed a PCE of 14.6% with a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 21.17 mA cm−2 and an FF of 72.4%, which is comparable to that in our previous work.21 The CS2-based all-PSC device exhibited a PCE of 13.0%, with a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 21.09 mA cm−2 and an FF of 65.2% while all-PSC based on 1,2,4-TMB yielded a PCE of 13.8% with a Jsc of 21.0 mA cm−2, and an FF of 69.5%. Importantly, an impressively high PCE of 15.6% was obtained for the o-XY-processed all-PSCs mainly attributed to the enhanced Jsc (22.1 mA cm−2) and FF (74.1%). The changes in the Vocs in all-PSCs were negligible (Voc ≈ 0.95 V). To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 15.6% is among the highest values reported so far for green-solvent-processed all-PSCs (Fig. 2b, Fig. S5 and Table S6, ESI†). We assume that the improvements in Jsc and FF were mainly ascribed to the higher absorption coefficient of o-XY-processed BHJ film and superior charge transfer dynamics. As shown in Table 1, the CS2 processed all-PSCs showed a larger fluctuation in their PCEs (0.96%) compared to those of 1,2,4-TMB and o-XY based devices. This can be ascribed to the relatively poor controllability of the film morphology formation during the spin-coating process, resulting from the strong volatility of CS2 and relatively lower solubility of the active materials in CS2. The Jscs integrated from EQE curves for these devices are in good agreement with the Jscs measured from J–V curves within 5% mismatches (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 2c, the EQE responses for the o-XY-processed device exhibited significantly increased values in almost the entire wavelength coverage from 300 to 900 nm than those of devices based on CS2 and 1,2,4-TMB, which is stemmed from its higher absorption coefficient. Fig. 2d shows that the PCE values obtained from the corresponding 15 devices had a narrow distribution, demonstrating the good reproducibility of the photovoltaic performances of the nonhalogenated-solvent-processed devices. The average PCE values reach 14.4% and 15.3% for the PM6:L14 blend processed with CF and o-XY solvents, respectively.
To evaluate the effects of the processing solvents on charge generation, recombination and extraction, we carried out a series of charge transfer dynamics characterization. First, the photocurrent density (Jph) against effective voltage (Veff) was measured to estimate the exciton dissociation efficiency (Pdiss). As shown in Fig. 2e, Jph reaches the saturation value (Jsat) at high Veff (>0.5 V). We assessed the maximum exciton generation rates (Gmax) using the equation Gmax = Jsat/q·L, in which Jsat is the saturated photocurrent density, q denotes the electronic charge and L indicates the film thickness in the devices. The calculated Gmax of the devices are listed in Table S7 (ESI†). The PM6:L14 device processed with o-XY had the highest Gmax value (1.40 × 1028 m−3 s−1), which was slightly higher than those for the CS2 (1.28 × 1028 m−3 s−1) and 1,2,4-TMB (1.33 × 1028 m−3 s−1) processed counterparts, indicating that the number of generated excitons of the o-XY-processed device was larger than those of the CS2 and 1,2,4-TMB-based ones.56,57 Besides, the all-PSCs processed with o-XY exhibited the highest Pdiss value (97.43%), which explains the high Jsc value. Next, the dependence of J–V characteristics versus light intensity was conducted to understand the charge recombination mechanism. According to the power-law correlation Jsc ∝ Pαlight,58 the exponential factor of α is close to 1 when the bimolecular recombination is negligible. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the o-XY-based device had a higher α value (0.984) than devices based on 1,2,4-TMB (0.971) and CS2 (0.966), indicative of more suppressed bimolecular recombination in devices processed with o-XY solvent. These observations agree well with the trends of FF obtained for the green-solvent-based devices. Regarding the Voc and the light intensity correlation, a slope of 1.26 kT/q was obtained from o-XY based devices, which is significantly smaller than those (1.39 and 1.46 kT/q) for the 1,2,4-TMB- and CS2-processed devices. Furthermore, the carrier mobilities of the blend films were measured by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. 2f and Fig. S7, ESI†), and the calculated μe,SCLCs and μh,SCLCs as well as the statistics distribution of SCLC values are included in Table S8 and Fig. S8 (ESI†), respectively. Compared to the μe,SCLCs of 3.84 × 10−4 and 4.98 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the CS2 and 1,2,4-TMB processed blends, the o-XY-processed blend exhibited the higher μe,SCLC of 7.04 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, resulting in a more balanced μh,SCLC/μe,SCLC of 1.12 and thus higher Jsc and FF.59–61
The distinct charge transfer dynamics triggered our interest in characterizing the morphological difference of all-polymer blend films to explore the correlation between photovoltaic properties and BHJ film morphology. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to probe the surface structure of blend films (Fig. 3a–i). Different processing solvents have significant impacts on the surface topologies of PM6:L14 blends. Relatively coarser surfaces were observed from AFM height images of the films processed with both CS2 and 1,2,4-TMB solvents, with root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of 2.22 and 1.95 nm, respectively (Fig. 3a and b). In contrast, the blend film processed with o-XY exhibited a relatively smoother surface with a RMS roughness of 1.28 nm (Fig. 3c), which can be clearly observed from the 3D height photogragh.62 Moreover, better interconnected fibrillar textures can be seen in o-XY processed active layers in the AFM phase images compared to the segregated phases of CS2 and 1,2,4-TMB-processed films (Fig. 3g–i), demonstrating that o-XY is the optimal processing solvent for the PM6:L14 system.
 Fig. 3  (a–c) AFM height, (d–f) 3D height, (g–i) phase images and (j–l) TEM photographs of PM6:L14 all-PSCs processed by CS2, 1,2,4-TMB and o-XY green solvents, respectively. 
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also employed to examine the BHJ morphology of the blend film (Fig. 3j–l).63 Distinct processing solvents led to different fiber sizes and densities. The CS2-processed thin film showed larger and uneven aggregations similar to those seen in AFM images. By contrast, 1,2,4-TMB and o-XY-processed blend films showed much less distinct segregation between the PM6 and L14 domains. In particular, the o-XY-based blend film shows fibrilar textures of nanoscale domains, which is advantageous for the efficient exciton dissociation and charge transport.
The grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements were performed to further investigate crystalline structures of the blend films. While all the blends exhibited face-on oriented molecular packings, differences in their crystalline structures were observed depending on the processing solvents. For example, the (100) peaks in the in-plane (IP) direction (qxy = 0.30 Å−1) and (010) peaks in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction (qz = 1.66 Å−1) became stronger and sharper, following a sequence of CS2, 1,2,4-TMB and o-XY in the 2D-images (Fig. 4a). This is supported more quantitatively by comparing the crystal coherence length (Lc) values of the peaks in different blends, which were estimated by the Scherrer equation.64 For instance, o-XY processed films showed higher Lc values in both IP (100) peak (L100c = 16.59 nm) and OOP (010) peak (L010c = 1.84 nm), compared with the films processed with CS2 (L100c = 9.63 nm and L010c = 1.60 nm) and 1,2,4-TMB (L100c = 13.40 nm and L010c = 1.81 nm) (Table S9, ESI†). The increased crystallinities in both lamellar and π–π stackings of the o-XY-processed blend are believed to improve the charge transporting ability and Jsc of the all-PSCs, in comparison to the blends processed with the other solvents.65 Based on the aforementioned results, morphological parameters are plotted with the PCE and FF values of the all-PSCs depending on their processing solvents (Fig. 4d). The linear increases of RMS values (1.28 < 1.95 < 2.22 nm) and decreases of IP (100) Lc values (16.59 > 13.40 > 9.63 nm) in the order of o-XY, 1,2,4-TMB, and CS2 were observed, and the trends are correlated with the increasing PCE and FF values of the corresponding all-PSCs. This result indicates that the o-XY processed blend exhibits optimal morphological features of the suppressed segregation between the polymer donor and acceptors while maintaining the strong crystalline structures of the polymers. Thus, both the charge generation and transport can be effectively improved in the o-XY processed blend, resulting in significantly enhanced FF and PCE values in the all-PSCs.

(e) Schematic illustrations of the D/A interfaces in the PM6:L14 blend processed by CS2, 1,2,4-TMB and o-XY. 
The relationship between blend morphology and device property is illustrated in the schematic diagram to elucidate the impact of green solvent processing on the PM6:L14 blend (Fig. 4e). The relatively poor solubility of PM6 and L14 in the CS2 solvents results in strong self-aggregation in the solution. As a result, large-sized aggregations and segregated domains are generated during the film-formation, and the smaller D/A interfaces deteriorate charge generation properties.51 Also, non-geminate recombination prevalently occurs due to the existence of aggregated structures, resulting in the decrease of Jsc and FF values.66 In contrast, for the films processed by 1,2,4-TMB and o-XY solvents, more uniform and less segregated blend morphology are observed. Between those, o-XY having a lower boiling point can freeze the blend morphology more quickly via the same 60 °C warm spin-coating approach before excessive segregation of PM6 and L14 domains occurs, leading to the optimal morphology with a balance of pure domains and intermixed phases.67 Therefore, the sufficient D/A interfaces and fine-tuned phase separation dimensions in the o-XY-processed blend film afford effective exciton dissociation and charge transport, thereby boosting Jsc and FF for all-PSCs.
All-PSCs typically show superior moisture and oxygen tolerances compared to those of SMAs-based solar cells,68,69 which motivates us to examine the device performances of green solvent processing fabricated under ambient conditions. Hence, we prepared the active layers using the same optimal device conditions but in air at room temperature and humidity (H) of ∼50%. As shown in Fig. 5a, Fig. S9 (ESI†) and Table 2, the as-cast device processed with CF can attain a maximum PCE of 14.0%, which records a decrease of 5.5% compared with the devices prepared in a nitrogen atmosphere. The o-XY-processed PM6:L14 devices achieved a significantly higher PCE of 14.9% (only 4.7% decrement) than the CF-processed analogues, which further demonstrated the great potential of green solvent processing.

The improved device performance processed with o-XY can be attributed to the solvent-induced morphology control, which is mentioned above. For another reason, the o-XY processed thin film shows a slightly higher contact angle of 106.4° than that (104.5°) of the CF-treated counterparts (Fig. S11, ESI†). An increased hydrophobic property of o-XY-processed films could be beneficial for increasing the moisture resistance of the device during its fabrication under ambient air. In addition, a decent PCE of 13.0% for a single-component green solvent without any additives was achieved. The statistical analysis of the corresponding performance for 20 devices under ambient conditions was depicted in Fig. 5b, indicative of good reproducibility of the device fabrication. To further evaluate the operational stability, the stabilized photocurrent and PCEs of the champion devices based on CF- and o-XY-processed active layers at the maximum power point (MPP, 0.79 V) were measured. As shown in Fig. 5c, the stabilized power output (SPO) for CF and o-XY-processed devices were maintained to be 14.4% and 15.3% after 350 s duration, correlating well to the values as extracted from the J–V results. These results indicate that the o-XY-processed PM6:L14-based all-PSCs have good tolerance not only in water/oxygen-prepared conditions but also under MPP tracking.
In summary, we reported an effective nonhalogenated-solvent-processed approach for all-PSCs system to substitute the harmful CF solvent in achieving highly efficient and eco-friendly all-PSCs. Three green solvents of CS2, 1,2,4-TMB and o-XY with different boiling points are selected as the host solvents to control the film drying kinetics. Moreover, fine-tuned BHJ morphology was achieved via a warm spin-coating technique. It should be noted that a totally green-solvent-processed system is constructed using non-halogenated solvent additives (1-MN). As a result, the PCEs of the all-PSCs are enhanced from 13.0% (in CS2) to 15.6% (in o-XY), which represents the record value for green-solvent-processed all-PSCs. The success of this green solvent strategy benefits from the detailed morphological optimization in the o-XY system, which improves blend-film crystallinity and forms a nanoscale fibrous network to facilitate charge carrier transfer and inhibit non-geminate recombination. The straightforward morphology–property–performance correlation delineated in the PM6:L14 model system can offer a rational guideline for the choice of appropriate processing solvents for all-PSCs. Of particular importance is that o-XY-processed PM6:L14 devices fabricated under ambient air achieve a decent PCE approaching 15.0%, benefited by its better hydrophobic property, further demonstrating the great promise of green solvent processing. These results highlight the feasibility of a green-solvent-induced morphology control strategy for fabricating high-performance and eco-friendly all-PSCs.

Broader context
Polymer solar cells (PSCs), composed of polymer semiconducting materials, directly converting solar energy into needed electrical energy, can be fabricated through large-scale roll-to-roll processing. Thereinto, all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), consisting of polymer donors and polymer acceptors, have drawn great attraction because of their excellent stability and better flexibility. Nevertheless, the development of all-PSCs relatively lagged behind due to greater difficulty in regulating all-polymer blend morphology. Very recently, the PCEs of all-PSCs have been increased up to over 14% mainly via the utilization of the “polymerized small-molecule acceptor” strategy. However, most high-performance all-PSCs are typically processed with chlorinated solvents, which are harmful to global environments and human health. Therefore, a series of halogen-free solvents such as 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (2-MeTHF), cyclopentyl methyl ether (CPME), as well as some toluene/o-xylene (o-XY) mixed solvents, have been developed to fabricate environmentally friendly all-PSCs. Despite the great effort, acquiring high-performance all-PSCs processed with such a non-chlorinated solvent remains a challenge. To this end, we delineate morphology–property–performance correlation using three green solvents of CS2, 1,2,4-TMB and o-XY with different boiling points (b.p.) to fine-tune the BHJ morphology, which provides useful guidelines towards highly efficient and eco-friendly all-PSCs.
